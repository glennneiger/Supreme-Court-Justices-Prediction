ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
course
of
their
investigative
work,
federal
law
enforcement
officials,
of
necessity,
routinely
come
into
possession
of
substantial
amounts
of
highly
sensitive
and
highly
personal
information.
sometimes
that
information
includes
graphic
death
scene
and
autopsy
photographs.
those
photographs
are
taken
for
the
limited
and
restricted
use
of
law
enforcement
and
public
safety
officials.
they
are
not
freely
available
to
the
general
public
as
a
matter
of
law,
custom,
or
practice.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
death
scene
photographs
should
be
broadly
disclosed
to
the
general
public
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
they
should
not.
the
freedom
of
information
act's
purpose
is
not
maximum
disclosure,
but
responsible
disclosure,
and
the
publication
of
death
scene
photographs
goes
beyond
the
bounds
of
responsible
disclosure,
because
in
the
terms
of
exemption
7(c),
production
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
the
personal
privacy
of
surviving
family
members.
in
ordering
the
release
of
four
photographs
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
that
substantial
intrusion
on
privacy
would
occur,
but
it
then
committed
three
errors
in
assessing
the
countervailing
public
interest
in
disclosure.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
no,
the...
the
practice
of
the
federal
government
is
that
we
need
to
identify
the
existence
of
a
survivor.
there
was
a
case
in
the
d.c....
excuse
me...
district
court,
named
outlaw,
that
i
believe
was
cited
in
respondent's
brief,
where
the
department
of
defense
had
asserted
survivor
privacy
without
having
first
identified
a
survivor,
and
that
was
held
to
be
impermissible,
and
as
a
matter
of
practice,
because
this
is
sort
of
specialized
application
of
privacy
interest,
the
government
identifies
a
survivor
before
invoking
it.
but
that
is
often
not
a
difficult
job
because
the
types
of
records
that
bring
the
photos
to
us,
law
enforcement
records,
military
records
when
it's
a
military
service
member
who's
been
autopsied,
will
often
contain,
or
allow
the
identification,
of
family
members.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
justice
scalia,
that
has
been
the
practice
after
the
outlaw
decision
of
the
federal
government.
it...
it's
not
inconceivable
to
me
that
because
you're
talking
about
an
objective
test,
at
least
under
7(c)...
some
of
these
photographs
are
held...
upheld
under...
or
withheld
under
exemption
6,
which
doesn't
have
the
same
objective
test
language.
it's
not
inconceivable
that
the
government
could
justify
withholding,
in
a
situation
like
after
the
collapse
of
the
world
trade
center
towers,
and
their
substantial
amounts
of...
sorry,
but,
for
the
graphic
nature...
but
partial
remains
that
can't
be
matched
with
particular
individuals.
but
we
know
that
for
some
significant
percentage
of
those
people,
there
are
a
significant
percentage
of
survivors
on
a
match
for
match.
in
that
case,
i
think
we
would
argue
should
not
be
required
and
that
withholding
could
be
done
because
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--on
the
assumption
that
there...
a
reasonable...
obviously,
a
reasonable
assumption--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--for
the
most
part,
courts
have
said
that
privacy
dies
with
the
individual,
but
again,
the
problem
in
this
case
is
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
think
we
were
withholding
too
little.
it
rule...
it
ruled
that
we
were
withholding
too
much
that...
and
that,
in
fact,
when
there
are
known
survivors,
these...
these
disturbing
photographs
still
have
to
be
released.
and
in
doing
that,
they
committed
three
errors.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
justice
ginsburg,
that
has
been
the
government's
practice,
is
to
identify
a
survivor,
but
again,
i
think
our
position
is,
because
the
nature
of
our
world
has
changed
and
we
now
have
to
deal
with
situations
involving
mass
deaths,
that
we
aren't
going
to
insist
when
you
have
a
large
collection
of
remains
and
we
know
that
for
some
percentage
of
those
there...
there
are
survivors,
that
withholding
would
still
be
permissible.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
justice
scalia,
the
common
law...
a
number
of
common
law
courts
did,
and
they
did...
and
we
cite...
one
of
the
very
first
common
law
courts
ever
to
recognize
the
right
to
privacy,
in
1895,
the
schuler
v.
curtis
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
found
exactly
a
privacy
interest
in
the
survivors,
and
it
said
it
is
not
the
privacy
interest
of
the
deceased,
because
under
the
common
law
tradition,
privacy
dies
with
the
individual.
but
what's
being
protected
here
is
the
survivors.
it
sort
of
takes
three
forms,
first
of
all,
their...
their
memory
of
the
deceased,
their
ability
to
provide
a
dignified
disposition
of
the
body,
and
the
ability
to
have
seclusion
in
their
grief
and
repose
and
closure.
and
those
concepts
packaged
together
have
been
recognized
as
a
privacy
right,
both
at
tort
law
by
a
number
of
courts,
and
more
broadly,
by
custom
and
practice
in
this
country.
these
types
of
photographs
are
not
freely
available
virtually
anywhere.
a
large
number
of
states,
as
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
prevent
their
disclosure
or
have
restrictions
on
their
disclosure.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
test...
the
test
is,
as
this
court
has...
to
decide
whether
a...
a
invasion
of
privacy
is
clearly
unwarranted,
you
have
to
weigh
and
balance
the
intrusion
on
privacy
against
the
extent
to
which
the
information
disclosed
would,
in
this
court's
reporters
committees
decision,
contribute
significantly
to
public
understanding
of
the
operations
or
activities
of
the
federal
government.
and
in
this
case,
on
one
side
of
the
balance
is
a
substantial
intrusion
on
privacy,
requiring...
exposing
this
sort
of
information
out
where
family
members
will
see
it,
encounter
it,
where
they
will
know
that
their...
that
their
loved
one
has
not
been
buried
in
any
sense.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
they
used
a...
the
same
balancing.
they
recognized
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
there...
with...
with
one
qualification,
which
i
don't
think
is
a
distinction...
don't
think
it's
a
distinction
that
makes
a
difference.
certainly
on
the
privacy
interest
side,
they
agreed
with
us
that
there's
a
survivor
privacy
interest
and
that
that
has
to
be
balanced
under
this
court's
reporters
committee
standard.
now,
the
d.c.
circuit
has
said
with...
when
the
public
interest
that's
asserted
is
substantial
allegation,
or
is
unsubstantiated
allegations
of
governmental
misconduct,
that's
not
enough.
they
require
compelling
evidence
of
governmental
misconduct
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
regularity.
we've
articulated
the
test
is
clear
as
evidence.
i
don't
think
in
practice
there's
any
difference.
we've
employed
the
clear
evidence
standard
because
that's
the
standard
this
court
has
adopted
for
overcoming
a
presumption
of
regularity.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that
may...
that
may
well
be.
the
compelling...
the
way
the
compelling
evidence
standard
works,
as
we
understand
it,
and
the
way
the
clear
evidence
standard
works
that
we
propose
is
not
that
that
means
you
get
the
photographs.
it
just
means
that
you
have
something
of
weight
on
your
side
of
the
balance.
we
think
the
unsubstantiated
allegations
of
governmental
misconduct
are
worth
virtually
none,
if
no
weight--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--it
has
to
be
the...
the
evidence
of
governmental
misconduct.
empty
allegations--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that...
i
mean,
that
presumably
will
not
be
the
evidence,
right,
you
can't
just
come
say
that...
that
would
be
sort
of
boot-strapping
to
say
that
the
evidence
is
the...
i
have
to
see
that
so
that
i
will
have
my
evidence
of
your
governmental
misconduct,
which
essentially--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
the
test...
you
mean
with
respect
to
unsubstantiated
allegations
of
governmental
misconduct?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that
is
that
the
foia
requester
must
come
forward
with
clear
evidence
of
governmental
misconduct
on
their
own,
independent
evidence
on
their
own,
to
have
a
cognizable
public
interest
to
weigh
against
the
intrusion
on
privacy
that
has
occurred
in
this
case.
and
that
is
the
standard
that
this...
the
clear
evidence
standard
comes
from
this
court's
decisions,
which
say
that
is
the
quantum
of
evidence
needed
to
overcome
the
presumption
of
regularity
and
legitimacy
that
attaches
in
this
case
to
law
enforcement
investigations.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that...
that's...
with
respect...
until
an
exemption
is
triggered,
there's
no
need
to
have
any
reason
for
your
foia.
you
can
have
a
good
reason,
a
bad
reason,
or
no
reason
to
ask
for
information,
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--the...
the
initial
burden
on
the
government
is
once
an
exemption...
we
have
to
show
that
an
exemption
is
triggered.
we
have
to,
in
this
situation,
identify
a
cognizable
privacy
interest
which--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
that...
that's
right,
in
fact,
we
get
the
written
steps.
we
have
to
identify
a
cognizable
privacy
interest
and
then,
before
we
make
a
decision
to
withhold,
we
ourselves
must
make
the...
must
balance.
it's
our
job
to
do
this
balancing
before
we
invoke
an
exemption,
so
we
ourselves
will
then
try
to
identify
if
we
can
from
the
requester's
papers
or
on
our
own
what
public
interest
would
be
served
by
the
disclosure
of
these
documents.
now,
it's
not
the
particular
interest
of
the
requester,
but
it's
the
relationship
between
this
document
and
serving
the
public
interest
that
was
identified
in
reporters
committee
of
revealing
the
operations
or
activities
of
the
government.
so
in
this
case,
we
looked,
we
found
a
substantial
privacy
interest
here,
and
then
we
looked
at
photographs
of
a
deceased
body
at
a
death
scene
and
in
our
judgement,
these
reveal
nothing
about
the
operations
or
activities
of
the
office
of
independent
counsel
and...
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--justice
scalia,
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
there's
any
evidence
of
negligence
or
sloppiness
here,
but
if
we
adopt
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
we
adopt
that
characterization,
the
fact
that
someone
cannot...
can
identify
something
more
that
they
should
have
been
done,
or
the
fact
that...
that
they
disagree
with
the
ultimate
result,
is
not
governmental
misconduct.
the
type
of
thing
that
might
rise...
that...
that
might
count,
is
something
that
was...
if
you
had
evidence
that,
you
know,
governmental
investigators
had
suborned
perjury,
and
you
had
evidence
in
the
form
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i'm
sorry?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
don't...
i...
i
don't
think...
well,
if...
if
they've
got
evidence
of
a
sloppy
job,
then
foia
has
already
worked.
they
can...
the
purpose
of
foia
is
not...
it's
not
a
60(b)
motion
to
reopen
an
investigation
or
to
make
us
investigate
more.
it's
to
see...
learn
what
the
government
did
and
then
critique
it
as
much
as
you
like.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
justice
souter,
let
me
be
very
clear.
we're
talking
here
about
the
allegations
of
misconduct
because
that
is
the
public
interest
that
is
asserted.
one
might
be
able
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
a
public
interest
has
to
be
identified
at
some
point,
and
the
problem
with
this
case
is,
or
the
problem--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
i
think
that...
that...
that
is
sort
of
nothing
more
than...
than
a
desire
to
show
what
the
government
did
in
this
investigation,
transparency
in
government
interest,
which
is
the
point
of
foia.
but
once
you've
come
to
an...
applying
an
exemption,
you're
going
to
need
something
more
on
your
side
than
just
serving
the
general
interests
that
foia
itself
advances,
because
otherwise,
the
exemption
doesn't
work
as
an
exemption.
you
have
to
want...
want
something
more
than
transparency
in
government.
now,
it
may
not
be
that
you
have
to
show
misconduct.
you
might
be
able
to
do
it
because
there's
some
other
sort
of
acute
public
interest
that's
going
to
outweigh
it,
but
i
think
in
the
end,
the
public
interest
in
making
the
government
look
good
or
telling
the
government...
tell
the
public
more
about
what
the
government
did
is
never
going
to
be
enough
to
outweigh
the
privacy
interests
of
individuals.
you
can
do
that
with
the
substantial
amounts
of
disclosures
that
have
already
been
made.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
breyer,
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
when
you
said
that
if
this
type
of
investigation
isn't
enough,
what's
going
to
happen
in
the
routine
case?
this
is
the
gold
standard
for
law
enforcement
investigations,
and
if
in
this
case,
the
fact
that
someone
can
think
of
something
more
that
should
have
been
said,
something
more
should
have
been
done,
something
more
should
have
been
revealed,
then
in
the
run-of-the-mill
routine
law
enforcement
case,
there
will
be
little
protection
left
for
privacy.
and
the
problem
won't
be
just
that
this
information
will
end
up
on
the
front
page
of
the
new
york
times,
but
under
the
1996
amendments
to
the
foia,
if...
if
the
government
anticipates
three
or
more
requests
for
information,
we're
obliged
to
post
the
information
on
our
web
sites
for
photographs
taken
after
1996...
november
1996.
you
won't
need
to
go
to
findadeath
dot
com.
you
can
go
to
departmentofdefense
dot
gov
to
find
pictures
of...
the
50
pictures
that
are
routinely
taken
during
autopsies
of
military
office...
officials
killed
overseas.
justice
kennedy,
you
had
asked
about
the
remand,
whether
a
remand
was
necessary.
it
is
not
in
this
case.
on
pages
56a
through
59a
of
the
petition
appendix,
the
district
court,
before
being
redirected
by
the
court
of
appeals,
we
think
erroneously,
ruled
that
the...
the
pictures
should
be
withheld
applying
a
less
demanding
standard
than
the
one
that
we
approached,
that
it
just
balanced
the
allegations
of
misconduct
against
the
privacy
interest,
and
concluded
that
the
privacy
interest
still
outweighed,
assuming
that...
that
just
allegations
count
for
something
on
the
public
interest
side.
so
if
this
court
agrees
with
the
government's
position
or
requires
anything
more
than
allegations
of
misconduct,
there'll
be
no
need
to
remand.
it's
also
not
a
discretionary
decision,
it's
a
de
novo
review.
the
balancing
is
undertaken
in
the
first
instance,
but
it's
reviewed
de
novo
by
the
court
of
appeals
and
de
novo
by
this
court.
justice
scalia,
you
talked
about
this
doesn't
sound
like
privacy.
well,
privacy
is
a
language
that
has
been
used
by
not
all,
but
a
number
of
common
law
courts
that
are
cited
in
our
opening
and
reply
brief.
and
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
concept
of
privacy
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
has
gone
far
beyond
what
tort
law
would
protect.
there...
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
court
case
that
would
suggest
that
rap
sheets
should
be
public
records,
like
rap
sheets
would
be
protected
under
privacy
conceptions
in
common
law,
so
it
would
be
extraordinary
in
this
case
to
decide
that
the
language
congress
employed,
personal
privacy,
is
intended
to
be
interpreted
more
narrowly
than
it
has,
at
least
at
some...
at
some
courts
at
common
law.
justice
scalia,
you
also
asked
about
narrowly
construing
the
exemptions.
it's...
i
agree
that
there
are
cases
that
say
that,
but
in
john
doe
agency
v.
a
john
doe
corporation,
this
court
made
clear
that
these
exemptions
still
have
to
be
interpreted
in
a
way
that
allows
their
exempt...
the
purposes
of
the
exemptions
to
be
served.
and
in
a...
and
they
should
not
be
construed
in
the
non-functional
manner.
if
law
enforcement
is
to
become
the
instrument...
in
the
eyes
of
the
public,
the
law
enforcement,
the
federal
government,
will
be
the
instrument
of
these
types
of
disclosures
and
causing
this
type
of
pain
to
families
that
is
likely
to
have
a
chilling
effect
on
people's
willingness
to
provide
information
to
law
enforcement.
you
asked
about
other
statutes,
and
we
discussed
the
privacy
act
statute.
the
privacy
act
statute
doesn't
apply
to
survivors,
but
that's
because
the
language
is
specifically
different.
the
privacy
act
talks
about...
defines
the...
the
records
that
are
covered
in
terms
of
information
about
an
individual
and
information
that...
to
that
pertains
to
the
individual.
it
has
a
sort
of
very...
and
it
has
to
be
information
contained
in
a
system
of
records
that...
where
information
can
be
retrieved
by
an
individual
identifier.
it's
a
very
narrow
and
specialized
definition.
it's
exactly
the
type
of
definition
that
congress
would
have
used
if
it
wanted
a
more
narrow
approach.
thank
you.
