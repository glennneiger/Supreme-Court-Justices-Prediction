mr.
allan
j.
favish
yes,
chief
justice,
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
can
think
of
no
clearer
definition
of
the
phrase,
personal
privacy,
as
congress
used
it
in
exemption
7(c)
than
what
this
court
said
about
that
phrase
in
the
reporters
committee
case
when
it
cited
the
work
of
former
solicitor
general
charles
fried
and
other
noted
scholars
on
what
the
definition
of
privacy
is:
the
right
to
control
information
about
yourself.
that's
what
i
base
this
case
on.
i
want
you
to
stick
with
what
you
said
on
that
point
in
1989.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
justice
ginsburg,
the
definition
of
privacy
as
intended
by
congress
in
exemption
7(c)
was
before
the
court
in
reporters
committee,
and
this
court--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--i
agree--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--no.
i...
i
agree
with
you
that
reporters
committee
did
not
involve
death-related
documents,
if
that's
what
you're
saying.
i
agree
on
that
point.
but
reporters
committee
gave
only
one
definition
of
privacy
as
intended
by
congress,
and
that
definition
should
apply
to
all
circumstances
in
which
foia
requests
may
come
up.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
i
believe
it
is
an
important
interest,
but
congress
left
no
indication
that
it
intended
for
that
interest
to
be
protected
by
the
privacy
language
in
exemption
7(c).
mr.
allan
j.
favish
well,
the...
the
legislative
history
isn't
totally
silent.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
they
did
not
say
that,
but
they
did
talk
about
personally
identifying
details
and
government
agencies
where
person--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--from
the
legislative
history,
which
is
at
page--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--yes.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
i
agree,
i
agree,
and
that's
why
i
cited
what
this
court
did
in
reporters
committee,
and
those
concerns
are
valid
and
those
concerns
should
be
made
to
congress
in
an
attempt
to
get
them
to
add
another
exemption
to
the
foia,
if
that's
what
the
government
and
the
foster
respondents
want.
we
know
that--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--that's
not
the
way
this
court
defined
it
in
reporters
committee.
that's
not
the
way
i've
seen
it
defined
anywhere
else
except
a
few
aberrational
cases,
which
by
the
way--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--the
right
to
be
let
alone
was
not
the
sole
expression
of
the
definition
of
privacy
in
that
article.
in
fact,
in
reporters
committee--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--well,
the
word
privacy,
if
it's
going
to
be
meaning
the
right
to
be
let
alone
in
its
broadest
sense,
i
suppose
anything
that
could
be
considered
a
tort
then
would
be
considered
a
violation
of
somebody's
privacy
right.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
well,
sure,
this
court's
decision
in
rose,
department
of
air
force,
there
are
many
cases--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--exactly.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
i...
i--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--yes,
absolutely.
that's
established
that
these
are
to
be
narrowly
construed,
and
that
was
a
part
of
the
legislative
intent
of
congress
to
have
the
exemptions
clearly
delineated,
specific,
so
that
there
would
be
clear
standards.
in
fact,
that
was
the...
the
reason
for
the
freedom
of
information
act
being
enacted
in
1966,
because
the
prior
enactment
was
allowing
the
government
to
take
ambiguous
language
and
cover
every
document
with
it.
so
if
you
are
going
to
come
up
with
another
definition
of
privacy,
it
has
to
fit
within
that
legislative
intent.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
okay.
two...
two
parts
to
your
question.
first,
as
to
your
first
part,
based
on
what
this
court
did
in
reporters
committee,
i'd
say
privacy
in
this
context
is
the
right
to
control
information
about
yourself.
if
the
survivors
have
no
information
in
that
photograph
or
document,
they
have
no
privacy
interest
here.
with
regard
to
the
challenger
case,
the
d.c.
circuit
in
challenger
did
not
reach
this
issue.
the
sole
issue
they
decided
was
whether
or
not
the
threshold
had
been
met
in
this
exemption
(c)
case,
which
was
whether
the
file
was
a
personnel,
medical,
or
similar
file.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
the
district
court
made
the
decision
that
there
was
a
privacy
interest,
but
it
wasn't
the
d.c.
circuit
that
made
that
decision,
and
the
d.c.--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--yes,
i
would.
and
i'd
like
to
point
to
two
cases,
one
of
which
has
already
been
cited
to
you
in
the
brief
by
the
silha
center,
one
of
the
amicus,
and
that's
cordell
v.
detective
publications.
it's
a
sixth
circuit
opinion
from
1969.
and
also,
a
case
that
hasn't
been
cited
to
you
yet
is
a
federal
district
court
case
called
young
v.
that
was
the
week
that
was,
and
that's
at
312
f.
supp.
1337.
the
beauty
of
these
two
federal
cases,
they're
both
from
1969,
which
is
just
three
years
after
congress
first
enacted
foia,
just
a
few
years
before
they
put
the
privacy
phrase
in
exemption
7(c).
they
talk
about
the
common
law
definition
of
privacy
and--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--well,
i
didn't...
i
filled
up
my
50
pages
and
i
didn't
address
this
specific
issue,
other
than
citing
reporters
committee.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
i...
i--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--no,
well,
then
i
look
at...
well,
first
of
all,
i
generally
agree
with
what
you
just
said.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
yes,
and...
but
i
don't...
i
disagree
that
it's
unfair,
because
then
i
look
at
what
was
cited
by
the
court,
and
all
these
scholarly
articles
talk
about
the
right
to
control
information
about
yourself.
and
i
see
nothing
else
in
the
word
privacy
from
the
common
law,
other
than
a
minority
of
aberrational
cases,
and
certainly
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
come
up
with
this
relational
tort,
this
survivor
privacy--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--right.
i
agree,
but
if
you
look
at
the
scholarly
articles
that
you
cited,
none
of
them
endorse
this
survivor
privacy
theory.
they
talk
about
privacy
as
the
right
to
control
information
about
yourself
exclusively.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
neither
the
district
court
nor
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--accepted
that.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
certainly.
if
you
do--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--no,
i
don't.
and
if
you
do
get
to
a
second
step
where
you
are
going
to
be
balancing
whatever
privacy
interest
you
might
find
here
against
the
public's
interest,
then
you
have
an
overwhelming...
an
overwhelming
case
that's
been
established
showing
that
there
was
government
misconduct
here,
at
least
negligence.
and
i
talk
about
the
government
conduct
on
two
separate
levels.
one,
there
was
government
conduct
in
investigating
mr.
foster's
death,
finding
out
what
happened
to
him.
second,
there
was
government
conduct
in
reporting
about
that
death
and
the
investigation
to
the
public.
the
primary
reporting
agencies
here
were
the
fiske
and
starr
oics.
now,
with
regard
to
the
first
area
of
government
conduct,
the
investigation
as
to
finding
out
what
happened,
it's
just
educated
guesses
that
the
public
can
make
about
whether
there
was
any
negligence
here.
but
with
regard
to
the
second
area
of
whether
or
not
the
reporting
conduct
by
the
government
was
at
least
negligent,
we
know
to
a
100
percent
certainty
that
there
was
at
least
negligence,
because
we
know
that...
let
me
talk
about
what
justice
scalia
talked
about,
the
autopsy
report.
to
be
more
correct,
your
honor,
it
was
a...
a
report
by
the
only
doctor
to
view
mr.
foster's
body
at
the
park.
it
was
not
the
autopsy
report.
it
was
a
two-page
document.
page
2
talked
about
the
death-shot
being
mouth
to
neck.
mr.
hamilton
stated
that
mr.
starr
dealt
with
that
in
his
report.
that's
not
true.
mr.
starr
ignored
page
2
of
the
haut
report.
that's
one
of
the
problems
here.
we
talk
about
these
different
investigations.
well,
nobody
investigated
that
language
on
the
haut
report.
nobody
investigated
the
fbi--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--i...
i...
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
your
question.
i...
i
understand
that
all
10
photos
are
at
play
here
because--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--my
understanding
is
that
the
petition
that
was
granted
by
the
government
had,
as
its
question
presented,
was
the
office
of
independent
counsel
correct
in
withholding
all
of
these
photographs?
and
under
the--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--yeah,
the--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--yes,
i
did,
and
that's
being
held
over.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
so
i
believe
all
10
photos
are
at
play
here
in
what
decision
you
come
up
with,
because
the...
all
the
issues
presented
by
all
three
petitioners
are
subsumed
under
the
question
presented
in
the
petition
that
you
granted.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
well,
if
i
was
one
of
those
people
that
you're
talking
about
and--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--and
there's
information
about
me
in
the
document,
i
have
a
privacy
interest
in
the
document,
is
what
my
position
is.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
well,
then,
in
that
case--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--the
protection
would
be
in
the
balancing
that's
done
to
see--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--i--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--under
the
balancing,
all
the
factors
must
be
taken
into
account.
we
have
an
almost
unique
situation
here
of
a
deputy
white
house
counsel,
public
official,
very
close
to
the
president
of
the
united
states,
who
was
under
investigation
at
the
time,
there
were
documents
related
to
that
investigation
in
mr.
foster's
office,
that
is
why
kenneth
starr
and
robert
fiske
investigated
this.
we're
talking
about
the
highest
levels
of
government
where
there's
a
mysterious
death
by
gunshot.
this
is
not
one
of
the
cases
that
you
pose
a
hypothetical
about.
this
is
something
unique
and--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--i--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--i...
i'm
not
saying
it
would
be
confined.
i'm
saying
that
this
is
what
sets
those
other...
this
case
apart
from
the
others.
but
in
principle,
unless
it
falls
within
one
of
the
exemptions,
then
that
information
would
have
to
be
made
public--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--under
the
foia
as
it
currently
exists.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
well,
first
of
all,
i
believe
in
the
foia,
in
exemption
7,
there
is
an
exemption
for
ongoing
investigations,
so
much
of
what
you're
talking
about--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--yeah.
now,
i'm
just
talking
about
the
privacy
exemption
in
7(c).
now,
i
don't
know
in
your
hypothetical
whether
there
would
be
other
exemptions
to
prevent
disclosure
in
those
situations.
i'm
not
commenting
on
that.
now,
with
regard...
yes.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
justice
scalia,
i
would
not
characterize
them
as
foot
faults.
i
think
these
are
major
omissions
of
significant
evidence
that
pointed
away
from
the
government's
official
conclusion,
and
what
it
establishes
is
that
the
government
reports
are
not
trustworthy.
i
agree
that
in
the
end
those
reports
may
be
correct
and
it
was
suicide
in
the
park.
again,
like
i
said
earlier,
i
can
just
make
educated
guesses
about
that.
i'm
not
saying
that
it
was
definitely
something
other
than
that,
but
i
am
saying
that
when
you
have
a
high-level
government
official
involved
in
this
kind
of
investigation,
and
then
you
have
so
many
investigations
by
the
government,
apparently
to
get
it
right,
that
it
took
so
many,
you
have
a
public
interest
here,
unlike
almost
any
other
case
i
could
imagine.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
as
opposed
to
just
an
innocuous
neighbor
down
the
street,
perhaps.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
because
we're
dealing
with
somebody
who
was
working
close
to
the
president
of
the
united
states
and
we're
talking
about
the
freedom
of
information
act,
whose
primary
purpose
is
to
allow
the
people
to
be
a
check
on
government,
not
only
to--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--well,
it
very
well
might
be
with
regard
to
city
or
state
government
and
states
have
their
open
records
acts,
and
as
we
heard
before,
some
of
them
prohibit
death
photos,
but
they
do
that
by
legislation.
we
know
that
the
state
of
florida
did
that
in
response
to
amicus
teresa
earnhardt's
plea.
that's
what
should
be
done
here
if
they
want
the
federal
government
to
follow
the
lead
of
the
state
legislatures
here.
it's
not
for
the
courts,
with
all
due
respect,
to
rewrite
the
foia
exemption,
so
i...
i'm
not
disagreeing
that
that's
a
valid
concern,
but
the
way--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--oh,
absolutely
then.
if...
if
the
balancing
is
done
and
you're
talking
about
a
law
like
foia
where
the
primary
purpose
is
to
allow
the
people
to
ensure
that
their
government
is
honest,
because
that's
the
heart
of
our
democracy
and
we're
talking
about
the
integrity
of
our
law
enforcement
agencies,
i
can
think
of
no
higher
public
interest
than
what's
being
asserted
here.
and
again,
all
of
this
is
going
to
have
to
be--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--well,
in
principle,
yes.
how
the
balancing
would
come
out
in
each
individual
case
would
depend
on
the
ad
hoc
balancing,
but
the
principles
would...
would
be
the
same
if
the
law
is
the
same,
i
agree.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
well--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--well,
we're
not
talking
about
interfering
with
the...
the
burial
process.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
again,
as
i
read
the
foia
exemption
7(c),
the
privacy
exemption,
congress
has
not
legislated
that
the
government
is
allowed
to
withhold
death
photographs
under
this
privacy
exemption.
if
we
think
that's
a
good
public
policy
to
enact,
we
should
get
congress
to
hold
hearings
on
it
and
we'll
find
out
all
the
yeas
and
the
nays
and
that's
how
good
legislation
comes.
and
that's
what
should
be
done
here
and--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--oh,
in
terms
of
what
congress
might
do
or
what
this
court
might
do?
mr.
allan
j.
favish
well,
we
know
that
congress
used
the
phrase,
personal
privacy,
in
the
statute,
and
now
the
debate
is
over
what
did
they
mean
by
that.
and
apparently,
people
are
scribing
words,
alice-in-wonderland-like
definitions
to
words,
and
if
we
go
down
that
route--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--what
i
like
about
the
brandeis
article
is--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--what
i
like
about
the
brandeis
article
is
the
section
of
that
article
that
was
cited
by
this
court
in
reporters
committee.
the
brandeis
article
was
one
of
the
six
scholarly
articles.
now,
keep
in
mind,
the
brandeis
article,
1890,
was
maybe
the
earliest
trying
to
come
up
with
a
definition
of
privacy,
so
the
language
isn't
as
precise
as
what,
for
instance,
former
solicitor
general
fried
came
up
with
in
his
seminal
1996
article,
also
cited
by
this
court.
so
i
would
say
that
the
best
definition
that
provides
the
clearest
workable
standard
is
the
right
to
control
information
about
yourself,
and
again,
on
the
second
point
here,
i...
i
won't
go
down
the
litany
of
things
that
are
in
the
brief
talking
about
how
there
was
misconduct,
at
least
negligence
with
regard
to
reporting
this
case,
but
once
i've
established
that,
which
i
have,
i
think
that
the
government
can
no
longer
be
trusted
to
filter
the
raw
evidence
to
the
people
in
this
case,
and
i
don't
see
how
in
a
democracy
that
depends
on
the
integrity
of
its
law
enforcement
agencies
in
a
case
where
you've
had...
well,
by
the
way,
there
haven't
been
five
investigations.
for
instance,
the
senate
whitewater
committee
stated
out
the
outset
of
its
two-day
hearings
they're
not
looking
into
whether
mr.
foster
committed
suicide
or
not.
that's
in
the
record.
look
at
er
603
and
those
pages.
so
we're
also
looking
at
a
situation
with
regard
to
the
fiske
and
starr
offices
using
fbi
agents
as
part
of
their
investigation,
where
the
fbi
did
the
initial
investigation
with
the
park
police.
that's
all
in
the
record.
there's
a
conflict
of
interest
there
when
you
have
fbi
agents
participating
in
an
examination
of
what
they
already
did.
so
to
call
this
five
separate
investigations
is
highly
misleading,
and
i
think
that
the
only
investigation
that
will
matter
in
this
case
is
the
one
that
the
people
can
do
directly
by
seeing
the
raw
evidence
for
itself,
because
for
whatever
reason,
and
i
don't
impugn
the
motives
of
judge
starr
or
anybody
else,
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
that
he
actually
wrote
the
report.
he
had
lawyers
in
his
office.
i
don't
know
what
the
mechanics
was.
i
want
to
make
that
very,
very
clear.
i
just
want
it
to
be
known
that
we
know
objectively,
and
it's
undisputed,
there
were
major
pieces
of
evidence
omitted
from
the
fiske
and
starr
reports
that
point
to
something
other
than
the
official
conclusion,
not
just
little
details,
because
those
things,
i
agree,
can
be
explained
sometimes.
we're
talking
about
major,
major
issues,
and
those
are
spelled
out
in
the
brief
in
detail
for
you.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
there
is
the
privacy
act
enacted
in
1974,
and
there
is
a
definition
which
talks
about
personally
identifying
details,
and
i
don't
have
that
at
hand
right
now,
but
it's
consistent--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--i
don't
think
it
enacts
a
definition
that
gives
somebody
a
privacy
interest
in
a
document--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--which
has
no
information
about
them,
and
i
think
that's
indicative
also.
and
my
one
last
point
has
to
do
with
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
here
in
addition
to
the
reasons
i've
already
explained.
they
basically
said
that
it
isn't
the
release
of
the
photos
that
will
cause
the
harm,
it's
what's
going
to
be
done
later,
media
intrusion
and
so
forth,
which
i
think
violates
what
justice
scalia
said
in
his
concurrence
in
the
ray
case
about
the
derivative
uses.
now,
ray
was
an
exemption
6
case,
but
it
focused
on
the
word
that's
common
to
both
exemptions,
constitute,
would
the
release
or
production
constitute
the
invasion
of
privacy?
what
the
ninth
circuit
came
up
with
really
violates
what
justice
scalia
said
in
his
concurrence
in
ray,
with
which
i...
i
agree
wholeheartedly.
mr.
allan
j.
favish
i...
i--
mr.
allan
j.
favish
--i
think
they
would
be
well
advised
to
have
at
least
noted
what
justice
scalia
said
and
compare
it
to
what
they
were
doing,
and
if
they
had
done
that,
they
would
see
that
what
they
did
was
wrong
on
that
score.
and
that's
really
all
i
have.
i
thank
you.
