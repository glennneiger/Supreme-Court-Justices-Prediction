the
apparent
suicide
of
vincent
foster
who
has
been
the
deputy
counsel
to
president
clinton
received
wide
publicity.
that
was
some
time
ago
and
this
case
arises
in
the
wake
of
that
tragic
event.
the
case
was
brought
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
by
an
interested
citizen.
the
respondent,
whose
name
is
allan
favish,
favish
sought
to
obtain
copies
of
photographs
taken
by
investigators
at
the
scene
of
the
death.
one
way
to
state
the
issue
of
the
case
in
the
narrowest
possible
terms
is
whether
under
the
freedom
of
information
act
favish
can
obtain
the
four
photographs.
the
larger
legal
issue
is
whether
the
deceased’s
surviving
family
members
have
privacy
interests
that
they
may
assert
under
exemption
7(c)
of
the
freedom
of
information
act.
and
if
they
do
have
a
privacy
interest,
the
question
then
becomes
whether
those
interests
are
outweighed
by
the
public
interest
in
disclosure.

records
compiled
for

enforcement
purposes
if
their
production
could
reasonably
be
expected
to
constitute
an
unwarranted
invasion
of
personal
privacy.
this
case
originally
came
to
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
central
district
of
california
and
the
trial
judge
initially
ruled
that
only
one
photograph
could
be
disclosed.
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
ninth
circuit
remanded
the
case
to
the
application
of
a
different
legal
standard,
and
after
the
district
court
followed
the
instructions
of
the
court
of
appeals,
it
ordered
disclosure
of
five
photographs
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
as
to
the
release
of
four
of
the
photographs
which
are
the
ones
that
are
in
question
here.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
reverse.
the
first
issue
we
address
is
whether
the
family
members
have
a
privacy
interest
that
can
be
asserted
none
of
the
statute.
we
hold
that
the
freedom
of
information
act
does
recognize
the
rights
of
family
members
to
personal
privacy
with
respect
to
their
close
relative’s
death
scene
images,
burial
rights
or
their
counterparts
have
been
respected
in
almost
all
civilizations
from
time
immemorial.
this
well-established
cultural
tradition
acknowledging
the
family's
control
over
the
body
and
the
death
images
of
one
of
its
deceased
members
has
also
been
long
recognized
at
common
law.
we
assume
that
congress
legislated
against
this
background
of
law
in
scholarship
and
history
when
it
enacted
the
exemption
7(c).
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
presumption
when
we
decide
that
the
statute
provides
even
less
protection
than
the
common
law
did.
to
say
that
the
family
members
have
privacy
interests
does
not
end
the
case.
the
next
question
is
whether
the
invasion
of
privacy
interest
is
unwarranted,
a
question
that
requires
us
to
balance
the
family’s
privacy
against
the
public
interest
in
disclosure.
this
means
we
first
have
to
identify
the
public
interest
sought
to
be
advanced
and
the
public
interest
must
be
a
significant
one,
and
the
information
must
be
likely
to
advance
that
interest.
the
interest
here
is
a
citizen’s
interest
in
uncovering
deficiencies
or
misfeasance
in
the
government’s
investigation
into
the
apparent
suicide.
we
hold
that
where
the
public
interest
asserted
just
to
show
that
responsible
officials
acted
negligently
or
otherwise
improperly,
the
person
requesting
the
information
must
produce
evidence
that
would
warrant
a
belief
by
a
reasonable
person
that
government
impropriety
might
have
occurred.
here,
the
requester
has
produced
no
evidence
to
put
that
balance
into
play.
it
is
of
relevance
we
think
that
five
investigations
had
independently
concluded
that
foster
did
commit
suicide.
the
district
court’s
first
order
in
this
case
followed
the
correct
approach.
the
case
is
now
remanded
with
instructions
to
grant
the
government’s
motion
for
summary
judgment
with
respect
to
the
four
photographs
in
dispute.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
