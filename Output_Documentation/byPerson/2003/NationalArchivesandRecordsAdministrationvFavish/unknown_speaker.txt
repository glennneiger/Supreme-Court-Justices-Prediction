unknown
speaker
must
there
be
identifiable
family
members
to
suffer
this
invasion
of
privacy?
would
it
just
be
automatic
instead?
the...
a
scene
like
this,
you
would
assume
that
there
was
someone?
unknown
speaker
and
if
you're
so
unfortunate
as
not
to
have
survivors,
or
to
have
survivors
who
don't
like
you,
the
most
embarrassing
and
gory
photographs
of
your
body
can
be
released?
unknown
speaker
but
only
on
the
assumption
that
there
are
survivors?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
why
that's
necessary.
i
don't
know
why
you...
you
can't
say,
and
i
think
some
courts
have
held,
have
they
not,
that...
that
there
is
a
privacy
interest
in
the...
in
the
person
who's
died?
unknown
speaker
before
we
get
to
that
though,
on
the
question
that
was
asked,
if
there
are
no
survivors,
given
that
the
main
rule
of
foia
is
disclosed,
unless
you
fall
under
an
exemption,
and
exemptions
are
to
be
narrowly
construed,
i
don't
think
the...
the
government
could
suppose,
could
hypothesize
an
interest
that
may
or
may
not
have
existed
in
the
decedent
when
there
are
no
survivors.
unknown
speaker
but
why
is
that
any
less
of
a
leap
than
saying
the
deceased...
the
deceased's
privacy
is
being
invaded?
why
is
it
less
of
a
leap
to
say
that
the
privacy...
the
privacy
of
the
survivors
is
being
invaded?
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
it's...
it's
their
privacy
that's
being
invaded.
it's...
it's
their...
their
sensitivity,
various
other
things,
but...
but
it
seems
to
me
strange
to
speak
of
their
having
a
privacy
interest.
surely
they
have
an
interest
in
not
having
their...
their...
their
relative
displayed
this
way,
but
i...
i
wouldn't
normally
call
that
a
privacy
interest.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
we're,
in
this
case,
asked
to
apply
foia's
exemption
7(c)
to
interpret
it
anyway.
unknown
speaker
right?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
what
we're
focused
on.
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
propose
as
the
test?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
test
that
the
cadc
used
in
the
accuracy
in
media
case
involving
these
same
photos?
unknown
speaker
so
whatever
you're
proposing,
you
think
the
cadc
correctly
employed
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
glad
you
backed
off
from
compelling
evidence.
it
seems
to
me
if
there
were
compelling
evidence
of
government's
misdoing,
you
wouldn't
need
the
photographs.
if
it
was
already
compelling,
the
photographs
would...
would
not
prove
anything
additional
and
you
would...
you
would
reject
it
for
that
reason,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
are
the...
does
the
term
compelling
interest
refer
to
the
allegations
that
the
person
seeking
the
photographs
makes,
or
the
evidence
he
has
supporting
his
position?
unknown
speaker
independently
of
what
the...
the
photographs
themselves
would
show?
unknown
speaker
okay,
tell
me
again
what...
what
the
test
is
as
you...
you
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
does
the
government...
does
the
government...
as
i
understand
foia,
the
government
has
the
burden
of
proof,
the
government
presents
an
exemption
and
it
is
the
government's
burden
to
show
that
the
exemption
applies,
not
the
requester,
because
going
in,
am
i
right
to
say,
the
requester
can
ask
for
this
information
for
any
reason
or
no
reason?
unknown
speaker
so
what
is
the
government's
burden
that
it
has,
at
least
the
initial
burden
is
on
the
government
to
show
what?
unknown
speaker
now,
after
you
point
to
which
number,
7,
you
point
to
7(c)
and
that...
that...
the
burden
must
be
more
than
just,
say--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
millett,
you...
you...
you
say
that
you
have
to
show
clear
evidence
of...
have
clear
evidence
of
government
misconduct.
what
do
you
mean
by
misconduct?
what...
what
has
been
brought
forward
here,
at
least,
are
some
disparities
in...
in
various
governmental
reports,
which
suggest
that
at
least
there
was
negligence
or
sloppiness
in
some
of
the
reports.
is
that
enough
to
establish
what
you
mean
by
governmental
misconduct?
or
does
it
have
to
be
some
willful
cover-up?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
well,
we...
we'll
get
to
that,
i
assume,
right?
okay.
unknown
speaker
willful?
has
to
be
willful?
unknown
speaker
has
to
be
willful?
it
cannot
be
just
a
sloppy
job?
why...
why
isn't
that
of
interest
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
okay.
why...
why
then
do
you
take
the...
i'm
sorry...
why...
why
do
you
take
the
position
that
to
satisfy
the...
the...
the
condition
of
revealing
the
operation
of
the
government,
it's
necessarily
got
to
reveal
something
to
the
discredit
of
the
government?
what
if
someone
came
along
and
said,
i
think
this
was
a
superb
investigation,
and
the
government
is
far
too
modest
about
what
it
has
done,
and
i...
i
want
the
country
to
know?
would...
would
that
support
a
claim?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
if
misconduct...
my...
the
reason
i'm
raising
the
question
is,
if
misconduct
does
not
have
to
be
shown,
i
suppose
that
would
have
a
bearing
on
the
degree
of
misconduct
in
a
case
like
this
that
would...
that
would
suffice.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what
about
my
question
for
a
minute?
unknown
speaker
why
is...
why
is
it
an
illegitimate
public
interest
for
somebody
to
come
along
and
say,
i
want
to
make
the
government
look
good.
they
are
hiding
their
light
under
a
bushel.
i...
i
want
the
people
to
know
how...
how
fine
they've
done.
why
is
that
not
a...
a
possible
legitimate
objective
under
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
ms.
millett.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
hamilton.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hamilton,
assume
we
agree
with
you
on
all
of
that.
we
haven't
heard
anything
about
the
other...
the
other
half
of
the
inquiry,
and
that
is
what
the
public
interest
is
in...
that
might
overcome
that...
that...
that
privacy
interest.
i'm
sure
the
other
side
is
going
to...
is
going
to
talk
about
that,
the...
the
alleged
discrepancies
in
the
reports
and
whatnot.
can...
can
you
shed
some
light
on
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
arguably,
the
interest
in
disclosure
might
not
challenge
the
ultimate
conclusion,
but
rather
they
might
contend...
want
to
show
that
one
of
the
team
of
investigators
was
totally
incompetent,
and
it
was
necessary
to
have
three
or
four
other
investigations
to
reach
the
correct
result.
i
don't
think
the
ultimate
conclusion
necessarily
answers
the...
the
claim
that
there
may
be
some
public
interest
in
how
the
investigation
was
conducted.
unknown
speaker
well,
let...
let's
take
a
particular
item
of
evidence,
i
mean,
like
the...
the
autopsy
report
that
mr.
favish
claims
was...
was...
was
altered,
that
the
word
neck
was
white...
whitened
out
and
head
was
written
in
instead
to...
to
cover
the
fact
that
the
bullet
exited
the
neck
rather
than
the
head.
now,
you
know,
what...
what
he
and
other
conspiracy
theorists
would
say
is,
the
fact
that
five
investigations
came
up
with
the
same
conclusion
just
shows
the
extent
of
this...
this
conspiracy,
you
know.
they're
not
going
to
be
satisfied
by
the
mere
fact
that...
that
you
had
five
separate
groups.
they're
going
to
say,
oh,
all
the
worse,
all
the
worse,
this...
this
conspiracy
is
so
widespread.
well,
how
do
you
respond
to
that?
unknown
speaker
he
might
have
been
protecting
newt
gingrich.
did
you
ever
think
of
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
starr
might
have
been
protecting
newt
gingrich.
we
really...
we
really
don't
know.
[laughter]
may...
may
i
ask--
unknown
speaker
--the...
i
wanted
to
ask
this
question
of
the
government,
didn't
have
the
opportunity.
the
government
says
there
were
three
errors
made
by
the
ninth
circuit.
i
assume
the
district
court,
under
the
government's
test,
does
have
substantial
discretion
even
if
we...
if
we
adopt
the
test
the
government
wants
us
to
adopt.
and
my
question
is
whether
or
not,
rather
than
simply
reverse
and
remand...
and
reverse,
we
have
to
remand
for
the
district
court
to
do
this
under
the
proper
test?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
understand,
but
as
a...
as
a
legal
matter,
if
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
apply
the
proper
test
and
if
the
district
judge
has
to
exercise
discretion
in
the
first
entrance...
instance...
whether
or
not
we
have
to
remand
even
if
we
adopt
the
government's
argument?
unknown
speaker
so
you
want
us
to
do
that
weighing?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
initial
position
of
the
district
court,
wasn't
it?
in
the...
in
the
first
round,
didn't
the
district
court
uphold
the
exemption?
unknown
speaker
so
the
district
judge...
what...
i
don't
recall
what
standard
the
district
court
applied
in
the
first
instance,
but
it
was
the
ninth
circuit
that...
that
said,
district
court,
you
have
to
look
at
these
and
disclose
the
ones
that
aren't,
whatever
that
series
of
adjectives
is.
yes.
that...
that's
my
concern.
is
there
evidence
that
the
district
court
used
the
standard
that
the
government
now
argues
for
in
the
first...
when
he...
when
the...
judge
keller
first
looked
at
this
case,
did
he
adopt
basically
what
the
government
is
asking
us
to
adopt?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
hamilton.
mr.
favish,
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
unknown
speaker
the
issue
wasn't
before
the
court.
there
were
no
family
members.
it
was
an
individual,
so
it
was
natural
for
the
court
to
address
it.
unknown
speaker
but
the...
the
court
didn't
have
a
case
that
involved,
say,
for
example,
what
was
presented
in
the
challenger
case.
it
didn't
come
here,
but
it
did
go
to
the
district
court
and
the
d.c.
circuit.
unknown
speaker
are...
are
you
saying
that
reporters
committee
showed
that
that
decision
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
there's
a
tradition
going
back
thousands
of
years
in
human
life.
you
can
go
back
to
antigone,
euripides,
every
major
religion,
respect
for
the
dead,
respect
for
survivors,
and
that
runs
through
every
religion,
through
greek
myth,
tragedy,
and
why
isn't
that
important
enough
to
human
life
to
believe
that
congress
also
intended
to
encompass
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
history
is
totally
silent,
why
wouldn't
we
assume
that
congress
intended
to
recognize
something
so
deep
in
human
nature?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean
if
they
said,
no,
no,
we
do
not
intend
to
respect
this
sacred
tradition,
fine.
but
i
bet
they
didn't
say
that,
and
for
good
reason.
unknown
speaker
are
you
reading
from
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
use
the
text
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
i
would...
i
would
think
that
your
response
to...
to
justice
breyer
would
be
that
the...
that
the
word
privacy
is
not
a...
the
normal
way
of...
of
expressing
those
concerns
for
respect
for
the
dead.
unknown
speaker
you've
heard...
you've
heard
mr.
hamilton
mention
aspects
of
how
the
revelation
of
documents,
pictures
of
the
dead,
can
injure
a
survivor.
why
isn't
the
word
privacy
broad
enough
at
least
to
cover
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
one...
one
of
the...
one
of
the
definitions
that
i
think
we
instinctively
assume
is
the
very
simple
one
that
justice
brandeis
used,
the
right
to
be
let
alone.
that
is
at
the...
at
the
heart
of
a
lot
of
privacy
thinking
in
our
law,
and
the
right
to
be
let
alone,
i
suppose,
would
encompass
at
least
two
things
relevant
in
this
case.
one
is
the
right
not
to
be
assaulted
by
these
photographs,
which
will
be
very
upsetting.
that
is...
that's
certainly
not
being
left
alone
when...
when
you
have
to
go
through
that.
and
the
second
consequence,
i
would
suppose,
of
publication
is
simply
even
in
the
narrowest
definition
of
privacy,
even
apart
from
the
brandesian
sense.
if
these
things
are
going
to
be
published,
the
family
is
going
to
be
subject
to
intrusive
inquiries
again.
people
are
going
to
ask
them
for
comments
on
it.
they're
going
to
go
to
their
house
again
and
take
a
picture
of
the
front
of
the
house.
why
aren't
these
interests,
which
at
this
time
in
our
history
i
think
do
tend
to
fall
with...
within
the
concept
of
privacy,
easily
encompassed
by
the...
the
sense
of
privacy
in
the
exemption?
unknown
speaker
well,
nothing
it...
i...
i'm
not
suggesting...
your...
i
mean,
your
argument
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
has
to
be
one
narrow
definition
of
privacy
encompassed
by
this
word,
and
no
other.
you've
gone
back
to
a
case
in
which
we
were
talking
about
the
interests
of
the
living,
and
you
say
it
can't
be
anything
more
than
that.
why
do
you
make
the
assumption
that
privacy
is
such
a
circumscribed
concept
in
the
exemption?
unknown
speaker
mr.
favish,
do...
do
we
have
any
case
law
that
suggests
that
the
exemptions
to
the
freedom
of
information
act
are
to
be
narrowly
construed?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
your...
isn't
that
your
response
to
why
you
should
not
think
that
privacy
means
the
right
to
be
let
alone?
unknown
speaker
or
anything
beyond
its
narrowest
meaning?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
that
that's
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
this
court,
because
of
the
definition
in
reporters
committee,
has
already
recognized
that
it's
got
to
be
the
individual
that
is
in
the
photograph
and
families
are
out
of
it?
that
it...
that...
that's...
so
you
would...
you
would
say
the
d.c.
circuit
was
wrong,
the
district
court
in
the
challenger
case,
which
involved
the
voices
of
the
people?
unknown
speaker
yeah,
but
it
went
back
to
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
but
in...
in
any
event,
you
would
say
that
district
court
decision
was
off-limits
because
this
was
a
case
of
survivor
grief,
no
information
about
the
survivors?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if
they
were
decided
in
1969,
why
are
they
not
in
your
brief?
unknown
speaker
well,
on...
on...
on
reporters
committee,
maybe
you'll
disagree,
but
what
i
think
is...
is...
is
the
key
language
is
in
roman
iv,
where
the
court
says,
to
begin
with,
both
the
common
law
and
the
literal
understandings
of
privacy
encompass
the
individual's
control
of
information
concerning
his
or
her
person.
it
doesn't
say
consists
of
or
is
defined,
it
says
encompass.
the
court
couldn't
have
been
more
careful
to
use
a
word
to
say
that
this
is...
that
it
includes.
it
doesn't
say
it's
exclusively
confined
to.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
just
think
that's
a
very
unfair
reading
of
that
sentence.
now,
if
you
have
something
else.
unknown
speaker
i...
you...
you
agree
that
that
is...
that's
the
key
sentence
that
we're
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
what
we
were
involved
with.
it...
it's
not
our
style
to
say,
now
we
have
before
us
the
question
of
whether
there
is
this...
privacy
includes
control
of
the
individual's
information
about
himself.
now,
of
course,
there
are
many
other
definitions,
but
we...
we
don't
write
opinions
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
favish,
now,
the
court
below
didn't
really
rest
on
that
ground,
did
it?
i
mean,
you...
you
didn't...
the
court
below
didn't
think
that
privacy
was
limited
to
this...
to
the
deceased?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
and
so
i
assume
you
may
want
to
address
the
other
arguments
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
do
you
defend
the
approach
taken
otherwise
by
the
courts
below?
unknown
speaker
explain
how
the...
the
four
documents
that
we're
concerned
with
don't
talk
about...
none
of
them
show
head
and
neck,
so
i
don't...
we...
we
hear
only
about
those
four
documents,
right?
because
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
said,
right,
not
all
ten
but
only
those
four?
and
none
of
those
four
have
anything
to
do
with
head
and
neck.
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
that's
what
i'd
like
clarified,
because
i
thought
that
we
are
reviewing
a
decision
that
the
government
has
asked
us
to
review,
which
said,
government,
disclose
four
photographs.
unknown
speaker
but
the
court
below
said
yes
with
respect
to
six
of
them.
so
how
do
we
get
to
review
that?
unknown
speaker
didn't
you
cross-petition
on
the
six?
i
thought
you
cross-petitioned.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
answer.
right.
unknown
speaker
i'm
worried
about...
suppose
you
won.
i
take
it
the
police
investigate
hundreds
of
thousands
or
millions
or
crimes
every
year,
and
in
those
investigations
they
may
investigate
people
whom
they
later
conclude
are
innocent,
perhaps
again
hundreds
of
thousands
of
millions
of
them.
and,
of
course,
there
might,
in
respect
to
those
people,
be
lots
of
newspapers
or
others
who
would
like
to
have
the
police
records
about
people
found
to
be
innocent.
now,
what
would
protect
these
thousands
or
hundreds
of
thousands
of
innocent
people
from
having
the
police
investigation
of
them
displayed
on
the
front
page
of
their
local
paper
if
you
were
to
win
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
you...
but
suppose
you
won
this,
if
you
won
it,
then
you
and
everybody
else,
let's
say
millions
of
people,
you
don't
mind
perhaps,
or
not
enough,
you
don't
mind
enough,
but
a
lot
of
people
would
mind
having
a
police
report
about
them
on
the
front
page
of
the
local
paper.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
is
it
that...
if
you
win,
i
don't
see
that
those
people
would
have
any
protection
whatsoever.
unknown
speaker
the
balancing
would
be
that
the
police
had
found
them
innocent,
and
it's
not
that
hard
if
you
win
this,
where
there
have
been
five
investigations,
for
somebody
to
say,
oh,
there
was
a
police
cover-up,
they
weren't
really
innocent.
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
are
two
investigations,
they'll
still
say
it,
and
there'll
always
be
something
that
isn't
perfect
about
the
investigation,
so
they'll
have
a
peg
to
hang
their
hat
on.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
confine
it
to
uniqueness.
why
doesn't
everyone
in
every
hometown
in
america
have
a...
a
very
significant
interest
in
whether
their
police
department
is
adequately
investigating
and
evaluating
reports
of
homicide.
of
course
they
have
an...
an
interest
in
that.
unknown
speaker
every...
everyone
in...
in...
in
any
federal
district
has
an
interest
in
whether
the
united
states
attorney
and
the
fbi
and
so
on
are
investigating
serious
crimes,
and
i...
i
don't
see
how
you
can
confine
this
to
what
you
call
the
unique
case.
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--but
here's
the...
i
think
one
of
the...
the...
one
of
the
things
that's
bothering
justice
breyer,
and
it's
bothering
me,
if
we
accept
as
broad
a
principle
as
you
argue
for,
is
this:
that
one
of
the
things
that...
that
most
police
investigators
learn
very
early
on
is
that
when
the
investigate
a
crime
and
they
investigate
a
suspect,
the
suspect's
old
friends
and
enemies
come
forward,
and
the
latter
frequently
even
ups
some
old
scores.
the
amount
of
misinformation
that
is
intentionally
communicated
to
law
enforcement
officers
is
enormous.
they
have
to
evaluate
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
kind
of
misinformation
is...
is...
is
going
to
come
very
close
to
the
front
page
in
most
cases
if...
if
a
principle
as
broad
as
yours
is
accepted.
unknown
speaker
well,
yeah,
but
the...
the
problem
for
the
person
being
investigated
who
is
ultimately
exonerated
is
going
to
be
the
same
the
day
after
the
investigation
is...
is
over.
so
that...
that
doesn't
answer
the
problem.
unknown
speaker
neither...
neither
do
i,
in
fact.
mr.
favish,
here's...
here's
my...
i
mean,
one...
once
you
get
past
the
first...
the
first
issue,
whether
the
privacy
exemption
at
all
covers
this,
if
you
assume
it
does
cover
it,
you
have
relatives
here
who
are
going
to
be
very
much...
very
much
harmed
by...
by
this,
as
is
shown
by
the
mere
fact
that
they've
conducted
this
lengthy
litigation.
it's
lasted
how
long,
and
i'm
sure
it's
been
expensive.
now,
what
is
the
interest
on
the
other
side?
if...
if
you...
if
you
had
a
plausible
case
that...
that
these
investigations
reached
the
wrong
conclusion,
i'd
say,
yeah,
that's
a
pretty
significant
governmental
interest.
but
i
don't
see
that
here.
i...
you...
you...
you've
just
demonstrated
some
foot
faults
in...
in
each
of
the
investigations.
oh,
this...
this
investigation
made
this
mistake,
this
other
investigation
made
the
other
mistake.
who
cares?
i
mean,
you
really
think
that
that
is
a
matter
of...
of
significant
moment
for...
for
the
country,
that
there
was
an
isolated
mistake
in...
in
one
and
another
of
the
investigations?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
the
high
level
of
the
victim
make
that
much
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
say
a...
a
public
interest
in
something
that
happens
in
albuquerque,
new
mexico,
maybe
the
assistant
to
the
mayor
is
shot.
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
but
why...
why
wouldn't
that
be
just
as
true
of
this
incident,
hypothetical
incident
in
albuquerque
as
the
vince
foster
slaying?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're...
you're...
you're
getting
away
from
the
hypothetical.
the
hypothetical,
if
you...
if
you
insist
on
taking
this
line,
could
be
refined
so
that
we
assume
new
mexico
has
exactly
the
same
statute
and
has
interpreted
exactly
the
same
way.
then
you
have
to
answer
the
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
so...
so...
so
then
it
doesn't
just
turn
on
the
fact
that
it's
vince
foster
and
that...
and
the
chief
justice's
point
is...
is
that
this
was
going
to
apply
to
every
police
department,
every...
every
local
government
in
the
country
that
has
an
act
like
this?
unknown
speaker
when
a
person
goes
to
work
for
the
government,
on
top
of
everything
else,
he
even
loses
a
private
right
to
bury
the
body.
i
mean,
i'm
speaking
metaphorically,
but,
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
disadvantages
in
government,
and
you're
saying
one
of
the
things
would
be
that
after
death
there
is
no
protection,
even
to
see
that
that
body
is
buried
and
the
photographs
disappear
for
the...
for
the--
unknown
speaker
--it
would
just
go
on
forever.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
know.
i'm
speaking
metaphorically.
i
have
antigone
in
my
mind.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
does
privacy
cover
without
that?
are
you
suggesting
that
there
be
a
catalog
a
to
z
of...
and
the...
and
the
word
privacy
within
the
meaning
of
7(c)
covers,
and
that's--
unknown
speaker
--no,
in
terms
of...
the
court
has
no
leeway
unless
congress
has
such
a
catalog
and
this
is
one
of
the
enumerated
items--
unknown
speaker
--but
it's
not
very
alice
in
wonderland-like
to
take
the
brandeis
definition
that
started
this
all.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
alice
in
wonderland-like.
unknown
speaker
mr.
favish,
are
there
any
other
federal
statutes
that
use
the
term
privacy?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that
covers
relatives
who
are
deceased?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
either.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
ninth
circuit
is
bound
to
agree
with
justice
scalia's
concurrence?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
just
think
they
would
be
well
advised
to
do
so.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
thank...
thank
you,
mr.
favish.
ms.
millett,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
