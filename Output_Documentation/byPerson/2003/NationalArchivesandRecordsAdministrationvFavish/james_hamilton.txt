mr.
james
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
five
basic
reasons
why
the
privacy
interest
at
issue
in
this
case
should
be
protected.
first,
the
foster
family
seeks
to
protect
their
own,
wholly
legitimate
privacy
interests.
the
privacy
interests
here
of
the
family
are
to
be
free
from
seeing
these
photographs
on
television
and
in
grocery
store
tabloids,
to
be
free
from
the
knowledge
that
these
photographs
are
displayed
in
virtual
perpetuity
on
ghoulish
web
sites
that
show
death
and
carnage,
to
be
free
from
the
harassment
by
the
media
that
inevitably
will
follow
if
these
photographs
are
released.
second,
while
foia
privacy
protection
is
broader,
there
is
significant
common
law
authority
that
a
survivor's
right
of
privacy
is
violated
by
showing
photographs
of
deceased
loved
ones.
the
restatement
of
torts
recognizes
this,
so
does
reid
v.
pierce
county,
a
1998
decision
by
the
supreme
court
of
washington,
en
banc,
which
allowed
a
cause
of
action
for
displaying
the
autopsy
photographs
of
former
governor,
washington
governor,
dixie
lee
ray,
at
cocktail
parties.
third,
every
foia
case
that
has
examined
the
issue
has
found
that
in
appropriate
circumstances,
survivors
have
a
proper...
a
privacy
interest.
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
did
so
in
the
cases
involving
these
photographs.
there
is
a
1987
opinion
in
the
d.c.
circuit
of
badhwar
v.
air
force
that
does
so
regarding
autopsy
reports,
and
justice
ginsburg
joined
in
that
opinion.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
justice
scalia,
we
think
that
there
is
no
public
interest
on
the
other
side.
we
think
as...
as
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general
has
said,
that
there's
a
strong
evidence
test
for
showing
that
there
is
government...
government
misconduct
where
that
is
the
allegation
of
the
public
interest,
which
is
the
situation
here.
a...
a
number
of
courts
have
said
that
the
test
should
be
compelling
evidence.
the
d.c.
circuit
has
done
that
in
several
cases.
the
fourth
circuit
has
done
it.
other
circuits
have
come
to
other
standards
in...
in
terms
of
what
the
public
interest
should
be,
but
it
must
be
something
that
is
strong,
that
is
not
insubstantial.
secondly,
in
determining
what
the
public
interest
is,
the
court
must
be
aware
that
there
have
been
five
investigations,
five
investigations
of
mr.
foster's
death,
and
all
of
them
have
found
that
he
died
by
suicide.
these
investigations
have
released
over
3,000
documents
over--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
justice
stevens,
the...
7(c)
requires
a
balancing,
and
when
you
have
this
balance,
you
have
to
weigh
whatever
the
public
interest
is
against
the
privacy
interest.
and
here,
where
there
have
been
five
investigations,
where
the
reports
are
voluminous,
where
the
documents
released
and
the
photographs
already
released
are
voluminous,
it
is
very
difficult
to
see
what
the
public
interest
is
in
getting
these
photographs,
which
would
grossly
invade
the
privacy
of
the
family.
the
other
point
on
the
public--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
i
think
the
first
response
i
would
make
is
that
it
is
a
difficult
argument
to
make
that
judge
starr
conspired
with
members
of
the
clinton
administration
to
protect
that
administration.
[laughter]
judge
starr...
judge
starr's
report
was
quite
thorough,
it
was
over
110
pages.
he
answered
this
question
about
the...
the...
the
medical
report.
the
medical
report
was
somewhat
inconsistent,
but
certainly,
when
you
look
at
the
autopsy
reports,
when
you
look
at
the...
the...
the
photographs
themselves,
it
is
clear
that
the...
there...
there
was
a...
an
exit
wound
in
the
back
of
the
head.
there
was
no--
mr.
james
hamilton
--i...
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
hamilton
justice--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
i
would
hope...
i
would
hope,
given
the
full
record
here,
that
this
court
would
not
remand,
that
this
court
would
decide
this
issue.
it
has
been,
justice
kennedy,
10
years
since--
mr.
james
hamilton
--i...
i
believe
that
on
the
record
before
the
court,
the
court
can
decide
that
there
is
no
valid
public
interest
here,
and
that
the
interest
of...
the
privacy
interest
of
the
foster
family
greatly
outweighs--
mr.
james
hamilton
--i...
i
certainly
do.
i
want
this
case
to
end
at
this
court,
justice
kennedy.
it
has
been
10
years
and
it
is
time
to
give
this
family
some
peace.
mr.
james
hamilton
the...
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
james
hamilton
not...
not
exactly.
no,
he
did
not
adopt
a...
a
clear
evidence
test,
but
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance,
in
his
first
decision,
did
weigh
the
public
interest
against
the
privacy
interest
and
found
that
as
to
all
of
the
photographs,
the
privacy
interest
prevailed.
i
would
like
to...
i
would
like
to
return
to
the...
the
family's
privacy
interest
and
make
one
more
point,
which
is
that
law
and
tradition
treat
the
moment
surrounding
death
as
special,
private
family
matters.
a
family
generally
has
the
right
to
decide
how
to
conduct
its
leave-taking
and
how
to
dispose
of
the
body
of
a
loved
one
with
dignity.
at
a
funeral,
a
family
may
choose
whether
a
coffin
is
open
or
is
shut,
and
they
have
that
choice
even
if
the
deceased
person
was
a
public
official.
here,
the
foster
family
decided
that
the
coffin
be
shut,
and
to
effectively
open
it
now
by
disclosing
the
photographs
would
be
an
unconscionable
invasion
of
the
family's
privacy
interest.
in
the
reporters
committee
brief,
the
contention
was
made
that
the
invasion
of
sorts
here
would
be
minimal
and
would
impose
no
meaningful
additional
harm.
that
assertion
is
just
simply
wrong,
and
those
claims
ignore
the
potent
and
the
moving
declarations
submitted
in
this
case
by
ms.
anthony
and
ms.
moody.
these
declarations
express
what
any
family
in
the
circumstance
would
feel,
and
they
show
why
law
and
tradition
treat
death
as
a
private,
family
matter.
mr.
foster's
sister,
ms.
anthony,
in
her
declaration,
recounted
her
nightmares
and
heart-pounding
insomnia
each
time
she
has
seen
the
leaked
photograph
of--
