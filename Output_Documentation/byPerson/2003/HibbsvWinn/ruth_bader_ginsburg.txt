mr.
goddard--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
goddard,
i
thought
that
in
a
self-assessment
system,
such
as
the
one
we
have,
the
federal
government,
arizona,
that
assessment
is
associated
with
assertion
of
a
deficiency.
in
arizona,
is
every
taxpayer
assessed
by
the
government?
that
would
be
quite
a
different
system,
wouldn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you...
you
audit
everyone
in
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
the
government
does
when
it
wants
to
assert
a
deficiency.
and
we
were
told
that
the
assessment
just
a
week
ago
is
nothing
more
than
a
bookkeeping
entry,
and
what
it
does
is
it
triggers
certain
administrative
remedies.
but
my
understanding
was
that
an
assessment
is
made
when
the
government
wants
to
assert
a
deficiency.
otherwise,
there
isn't
this
entry,
this
bookkeeping
entry
someplace,
that
every
taxpayer
isn't
assessed.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
the
assessment
that
you...
i
mean,
you
used
the
internal
revenue
code
provision.
that
is
an
entry.
we
were
told
it's
a
bookkeeping
entry.
and
it's
made
as
a
prerequisite
to
levying
liens,
to
extending
the
statute
of
limitations.
but
it
certainly
isn't
true
that
that
kind
of
assessment,
which
is
what
your
brief
suggested
you
were
talking
about,
is
made
in
the
case
of
every
taxpayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
technical
assessment
that's
made
tied
to
a
deficiency
you
don't
fit.
so
you're
talking
about
some
other
kind
of
assessment
than
the
one
that,
for
example,
the
government
was
telling
us
about
last
monday
in
the
galletti
case,
not
that
technical...
some...
if
we're
talking
about
property,
say,
a
property
tax,
then
maybe
an
assessor
comes
on
the
land,
looks
at
the
house,
attributes
a
value
to
it.
that
wouldn't
be
a
self-assessing
system
from
the
taxpayer's
point
of
view.
but...
but
the
income
tax
is
quite
different.
you
assess
yourself.
sometimes
you
get
audited;
sometimes
you
don't.
and
i
don't
see
that
anybody
here
is
trying
to
stop
the
government
from
making
the
assessment
that
would
be
a
trigger
to
asserting
a
deficiency.
no
one
is
trying
to
stop
arizona
from
asserting
a
deficiency
against
any
taxpayer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
goddard,
in
that...
in
that
regard,
wasn't
what
congress
had
in
mind...
it
was
taxpayer
suits.
they
didn't
want
taxpayers
to
avoid
going
through
the
whole
process.
i
mean,
most
of
the
cases
that
come
up
under
the
tax
injunction
act
are
taxpayers
who
say
please
enjoin
the
tax
or
don't
assess
me
or
don't
levy.
but
this
is
not
that
kind
of
case.
there's
no
one
here
who's
trying
to
stop
the
state
from
collecting
revenue.
it's
an
attack
by
a
non-taxpayer,
and
that
at
the
time
of
the
tax
injunction
act,
i
don't
think
that
kind
of
action
was
even
on
the
scene.
do
you
have
any
claims
where
a
non-taxpayer
was
seeking
to
enjoin
the
collection
of
a
tax?
what
they...
what...
what
congress
was
aiming
at
is
that,
taxpayer,
you've
got
a
prompt,
speedy,
efficient
remedy
in
your
state,
you
use
that,
don't
rush
to
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
a
taxpayer's
case
too,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
the
case
you
just
cited...
wasn't
it...
that
also
a
taxpayer's
attempt
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i'm
asking
you
about
cases
where
we
don't
have
a
taxpayer
who's
not
trying
to
stop
any
assessment
of
his
tax,
any...
anything
else
about--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it's
the
only
one
that
i
know.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
a
self-assessment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
every...
every
taxpayer
is
assessed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
every
taxpayer
is
assessed
even
when
no
deficiency
is
sought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
every
taxpayer
is
assessed
even
when
there's
no
deficiency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but...
but
nobody...
nobody
here
is
contesting,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
what
we
were
told
monday
is
a
mere
bookkeeping
entry.
does
it...
does
it...
is
a
notice
and
demand
sent
out
to
everyone
who's
assessed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
is
anybody
trying
to
enjoin
a
bookkeeping
entry
that
nobody
knows
anything
about?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
don't
see
that
there's
any
effort
to
stop
a
bookkeeping
entry
from
being
made--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
nobody
gets
any
notice
of
and
doesn't...
is...
is,
we
were
told,
just
a
mere
bookkeeping
entry.
that
doesn't...
doesn't...
it's
not
necessary
in
order
to
collect
the
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
nobody
is
seeking
to
enjoin
any
assessment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they...
as
assessment
being
a
bookkeeping
entry
that
nobody
knows
anything
about.
you
just
said
you
don't
need
any
notice
and
demand.
in
the
galletti
case,
we
were
told
that's
what
the
assessment
is.
it's
a
notation
in
a
book
someplace.
it
doesn't
even
have
the
taxpayer's
name
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
they
clarify
that
they're
not
trying
to
stop
a
bookkeeping
entry
from
being
made
in
arizona,
even
though
arizona
law
doesn't
require
it,
just
like
the
feds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
although
we
were
told
that
there
isn't
that
bookkeeping
entry
in
arizona,
that
they
don't
have
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
not
what
you
described
as
the
assessment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
we
were
told
they
don't
have
in
arizona.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
were
all
taxpayers
trying
to
stop
the
collection
of
tax
from
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
point
you're
making
is...
is
it's
the
taxpayer
who's
designating
a
certain
portion
of
money
which
would
otherwise
go
to
the
general
revenues
will
instead
go
to
this
charitable
purpose.
it's
kind
of
like
on
the
federal
return
where
you
can
check
off
and
say
i
want
$3...
instead
of
going
to
general
revenues,
it
goes
to
fund
campaign...
to
presidential
elections.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
on
the...
that's
what
this
is,
isn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cohen--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what...
what
happened
in...
in
nyquist
and
mueller?
is
that
just
the
court
overlooked
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there...
one
sees
plain,
speedy,
and
effective--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
a
taxpayer
who
has
to
go
through
the
system.
but
that...
that's...
how
does
that
fit
when
it's
a
non-taxpayer
who's
stopping...
who's...
who's
trying
to
declare
a
credit
unconstitutional?
this...
this
quick,
speedy
remedy
is...
is
that
the
taxpayer
gets
a
refund
remedy,
gets
a
deficiency,
whatever
it
is,
but
how
does
this
swift...
how
does
that
play
into
somebody
who
is
not
a
taxpayer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
meant
within
the
meaning
of
the
injunction
act,
it
seems
that
swift,
whatever,
remedy
was
referring
to
the
taxpayer's
remedy
under
state
law--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--could
take
care
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
same
plaintiffs?
if
it's
the
same
plaintiffs,
you
would
have
a...
a--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--we
have
that
same
problem
in
habeas
sometimes
too
when
the
state
supreme
court
disagrees
with
the
federal
district
court.
justice
ginsburg
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
two
cases
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
case
is
hibbs
versus
winn.
respondents
here
plaintiff
below,
are
arizona
tax
payers
who
filed
suit
in
federal
court
against
the
director
of
arizona’s
department
of
revenue.
the
suit
sought
to
enjoin
the
operation
of
a
provision
of
arizona’s
income
tax
law
on
first
amendment
establishment
clause
grounds.
arizona’s
law
authorizes
an
income
tax
credit
for
payment
to
non-profit
school
tuition
organizations.
those
organizations,
called
stos,
awards
scholarships
to
students
attending
private
elementary
or
secondary
schools.
arizona’s
statute
allows
stos
to
designate
schools
that
provide
religious
instruction
or
maintain
religion-based
admissions
preferences.
the
question
presented
for
our
review,
does
a
federal
district
court
have
authority
to
adjudicate
respondent’s
constitutional
challenge?
to
be
more
specific
a
federal
law,
the
tax
injunction
act
of
tia,
prohibits
a
federal
district
court
from
restraining
the
assessment,
levy,
or
collection
of
any
tax
under
state
law.
does
that
act
bar
this
suit?
arizona’s
revenue
director
thinks
it
does.
he
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
urging
that
a
federal
injunction
would
restrain
the
assessment
of
taxes
under
state
law.
the
district
court
agreed
and
granted
the
motion.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
the
tia
does
not
bar
the
federal
proceeding.
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit,
we
now
hold
that
respondent’s
suit
is
not
the
kind
tia
proscribes.
in
decisions
spanning
a
near
half
century
including
civil
rights
challenges,
the
state
action
aimed
at
circumventing
ground
of
the
board
of
education,
courts
in
the
federal
system
including
this
court,
as
a
reviewer
of
lower
court’s
decisions
have
entertained
challenges
to
tax
credits
authorized
by
state
law
without
viewing
the
tia
as
a
jurisdictional
barrier.
on
this
first
occasion
squarely
to
confront
the
issue,
we
confirm
the
authority
federal
court
exercised
in
those
cases.
the
director
argues
in
effect
that
we
and
other
federal
courts
were
wrong
to
adjudicate
those
challenges.
he
contends
that
the
tia
trumps
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
which
authorizes
civil
actions
for
deprivation
of
federal
rights
under
color
of
state
law.
the
tia,
the
director
maintains,
bars
all
lower
court
interference
with
state
tax
systems
even
when
the
plaintiff
is
not
trying
to
avoid
paying
the
tax
imposed
on
him
and
no
matter
that
the
state
revenue
would
increase
should
the
plaintiff
prevail.
the
alleged
jurisdictional
bar
which
the
director
asserts
has
existed
since
the
tia’s
enactment
in
1937,
was
not
even
imagined
by
juror’s
in
pathmarking
civil
rights
cases
just
mentioned,
or
by
the
defendants
in
those
cases
who
had
every
interest
in
defeating
federal
court
adjuticatorial
authority.
our
prior
decisions
command
no
respect,
the
director
maintains,
because
they
are
mere
silent
holdings.
we
reject
that
assessment.
this
suit
implicates
neither
the
tia’s
conception
of
the
tax
assessment
nor
any
of
the
act’s
underlying
purposes.
taking
account
of
the
prospective
nature
of
the
relief
requested,
does
respondent’s
suit
in
the
tia’s
words
seek
to
enjoin,
suspend,
or
restrain
the
assessment,
levy,
or
collection
of
any
tax
under
state
law?
the
answer
turns
on
the
meaning
of
the
term
assessment
as
employed
in
the
tia.
for
internal
revenue
code
purposes
an
assessment
involves
a
recording
of
the
amount
the
tax
payer
owes
the
government,
rather
than
reading
the
word
assessment
in
isolation,
we
follow
the
cardinal
rule
that
statutory
language
must
be
read
in
context.
in
the
tia
and
tax
law
generally,
an
assessment
is
closely
tied
to
the
collection
of
a
tax.
the
assessment
is
the
official
recording
of
liability
that
triggers
levy
and
collection
efforts.
a
court
should
also
interpret
the
statute
to
effectuate
all
its
provisions,
if
as
the
director
asserts,
the
term
assessment
by
itself
signify
the
entire
plan
of
taxation
the
tia
would
not
need
the
words
levy
or
collection.
the
term
assessment
alone
would
do
all
the
necessary
work.
just
as
another
federal
statute,
the
anti-injunction
act
shields
federal
tax
collections
from
federal
court
injunctions,
so
the
tia
shields
state
tax
collections
from
federal
court
restraints.
in
both
statutes,
congress
directed
tax
payers
to
pursue
refund
suits
instead
of
attempting
to
restrain
collections.
third
party
actions
not
seeking
to
stop
the
collection
of
the
tax
imposed
on
the
plaintiff
or
outside
congress’
fair
view.
in
enacting
the
tia,
congress
trained
its
attention
on
tax
payers
who
sought
to
avoid
paying
their
tax
bill
by
pursuing
a
challenge
route
other
than
the
one
specified
by
the
taxing
authority.
no
where
does
the
tax
of
the
act
or
its
legislative
history
announce
a
sweeping
congressional
direction
to
prevent,
in
the
director’s
words,
federal
court
interference
with
any
aspect
of
state
tax
administration.
this
understanding
underpins
our
case
law
relevant
to
the
tia
and
the
decisions
of
other
federal
courts
as
well
consistent
with
the
decades
long
understanding
prevailing
on
this
issue,
respondent’s
suit
may
proceed
without
any
tia
impediment.
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion;
justice
kennedy
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
the
chief
justice,
justices
scalia
and
thomas
join.
