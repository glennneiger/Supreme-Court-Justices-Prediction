mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
united
states
is
that
respondents'
suit
is
barred
by
the
plain
language
of
the
tax
injunction
act
because
it
seeks
to
enjoin
and
restrain
the
assessment
of
a
tax
under
state
law.
and
to
turn
directly
to
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--we
think
it's...
yes.
we
think
that
the...
the
language
is
sufficiently
plain
that
there's
no
need
to
look
at
the
legislative
history,
but
that
if
you
do,
the
legislative
history
also
supports
the
interpretation
we
advance.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
judge...
the
case
before
judge
easterbrook,
justice
stevens,
was
quite
different
from
this
case.
that
involved
not
an...
a...
a
suit
against
tax...
the
tax
collector
to
affect
the
manner
in
which
the
tax
collector
administered
the
tax
code,
but
rather
a
suit
against
private
plaintiffs
who
had
brought
a
state
court
action.
it
was
a
federal
court
suit
to
enjoin
a
state
court
action.
and
so
the
considerations
applicable
in
that
case
were
obviously
quite
different
from
those
what
we
have...
where
we
have
presented
here.
the
point
of
the
tax
injunction
act
is
to...
to
protect
the
tax
collector
against
federal
court
suits
to
enjoin
or
restrain
the
tax
collector's
assessment,
collection,
and
levy
of
tax.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes.
we
think
that
is
also
quite
correct
here.
that
was
not
the
issue
addressed
by
the
ninth
circuit,
but
that
is
certainly
another
way
to
get
to
the
result
which
we
think
is
the
correct
result,
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
bars
this
kind
of
suit.
turning
to
the
questions
about
the
meaning
of
assessment,
it
is
perfectly
clear
beyond
peradventure
that
under...
in
the
federal
system,
the
term
assessment
means
the
tax
collector's
recorded
determination
of
the
amount
of
tax
due
under
federal
law--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
your
honor.
the...
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
your
honor.
the
practice
of
the
internal
revenue
service
is
to
assess
the
amount
of
taxes
shown
on
the
return
if
that
is...
absent
some
audit
or
some
reason
to
think
there's
an
error
in
the
return.
and
in
fact,
the
internal
revenue
code
so
provides.
section--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--correct.
well,
if
a
taxpayer
files
a
return
showing
a
bottom
line
calculation
of
how
much
tax
is
due
after
all
credits,
deductions,
and
so
forth
have
been
taken
into
account,
that
amount
and...
and
the
tax...
and
the
irs
checks
the
addition,
concludes
that
it's
accurate,
and
is
not
conducting
an
audit,
that
amount
is
assessed.
it's...
it's
recorded
in
the
transcript.
now,
of
course,
it's
on
the
computer.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
assessment
is
a
particular
thing.
under
the
internal
revenue
code,
it's
the...
it's
the
tax
collect...
the
irs's
determination
of
the
amount
of
tax--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--26
u.s.c.
6201.
this
is
not
in
the...
the
briefs.
26
u.s.c.
6201
(a)(1)
provides,
quote,
the
secretary
shall
assess
all
taxes
determined
by
the
taxpayer
or
by
the
secretary
as
to
which
returns
or
lists
are
made
under
this
title.
so
if
the
taxpayer
has
admitted
on
their
tax
return
that
they
owe
x
dollars
in
taxes,
the
secretary
shall
assess
that
amount
and
also
has
the
discretion
to
conduct
an
audit.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
not
if
the
taxpayer
has
conceded
the
amount
of
liability.
that's
the
point.
if
the
taxpayer
concedes
on
the
return
that
their
liability
is
x--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--because
assessment
is
the
formal
determination
by
the...
by
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
but
the
statute,
justice
ginsburg,
doesn't
say
anything
about
notice.
it
says
the...
the
federal
district
courts
shall
not
enjoin
the
assessment
of
a
tax
under
state
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
they...
they
are.
the
plaintiffs
are
seeking--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--if
i
may
answer,
justice
ginsburg.
what
plaintiffs
are
seeking
to
do
is
prevent
and
restrain
and
enjoin
the...
the
tax
department
from
assessing
taxes
under
state
law
in
the
manner
required
by
state
law,
which
includes,
as
part
of
the
assessment,
computation
and
allowance
of
the
credit
where
it
is
due.
and
the...
and
the
suit
in
this
case
would
preclude
the
tax
collector
from
doing
that
if
respondents
were
to
succeed.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
exactly
what
the
act
precludes.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
believe
what
the
arizona
tax
code
provides--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--is
that
the...
is
that
the
tax
collector
there,
the
department
of
revenue,
makes
a
determination
or
reviews
the
returns
and
ultimately
either
determines
that
that
amount
will
be
accepted,
that...
that
the
amount
of
tax
shown
on
the
return
is
the...
going
to
be
accepted
as
the
amount
of
tax
due
from
the
tax
collector,
or
that
they're
going
to
try
to
require
some...
you
know,
assess
a
deficiency
or
whatever
it
may
be.
but
in
either
case,
within
the
meaning
of
federal
law,
the
tax
collector's
determination
of
what
the
amount
is
due,
either
if
it's
the
amount
shown
on
return...
on
the
return
or
if
they
think
it's
a
different
amount,
within
the
meaning
of
federal
law,
that
is
the
assessment.
and
that
is
what
the
respondents
are
trying
to
change.
they're
trying
to
require
the
tax
collector
to
assess
taxes
not
in
a
manner
required
under
state
law,
which
is
the...
the
text
of
the
statute,
but
rather
in
a
manner
contrary
to
state
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
your
honor,
the
assessment
under
state
law
in
arizona
includes
the
tax
credit.
the
respondents
would
change
that
and
would
preclude
the
tax
collector
from
doing
that.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
exactly.
and
the
purpose
of
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
i'm
obviously
no
expert
in
arizona
tax
law.
i'm
informed
that
the
tax
collector
looks
at
the
returns
when
they
come
in,
checks
the
addition,
and
in
a
certain
number
of
cases
goes
further.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
the
assessment
is
the
tax
collector's
recorded
determination
of
the
amount
due.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
it...
again,
i
think
for
purposes
of
federal
law,
it...
it
is
not
unreasonable
to
assume
that
the
tax
collector
in
arizona
decides
whether
they're
going
to
accept
the
amount
of
return
shown
on
the
tax
as--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--and
keeps
a
record
of
it.
exactly.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
exactly,
exactly.
now,
the
attorney
general
can
address
that,
but...
but
that's
my
understanding
of
arizona
law.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
yes,
justice
kennedy.
that...
that
is
exactly
right.
that
is...
that
is
entirely
consistent
with
the
united
states'
view
of
and
interpretation
of
this
act
and
the
anti-injunction
act.
and
it's
also
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
and
purposes
of
the
act.
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized,
in
justice
o'connor's
opinion
for
the...
for
the
court
in
the
grace
brethren
case
and
in
other
cases,
that
the
purpose
of
the
act
sweeps
more
broadly
than
simply
a
focus
on
collection
and--
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
but
the
court
did
not
say
that
the
purpose
and
scope
of
the
act
is
limited
to
that
context,
nor
is
the
language
limited
to
that
context.
to
the
contrary,
the
court
said
this...
the
act
sweeps
broadly
to
prevent
federal
court
interference
in
the
administration
of...
of
state
tax
systems.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
that
is
certainly
a
primary
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
it's...
it's
not
applicable
here,
although
i
think
it
is
important
to
recognize
that
it
would
be
quite
extraordinary
for
federal
courts
to
be
in
the
business
of
ordering
state
tax
collectors
to
collect...
to
collect
taxes
from
their
citizens
that
the
legislature
of
the
state
had
deemed
should
not
be
collected.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
well,
i
think
some
of
those
quotes,
if
i
recall
correctly,
justice
o'connor,
deal
with...
they
say
the...
the
tax
injunction
act
does
not
apply
to
suits
to
collect
taxes,
which
is
a
different
situation
than
here.
mr.
thomas
g.
hungar
this
court
in
two
or
three
cases
identified
by
respondents
has
not
addressed
the
tax
injunction
act
where
it
might
be...
it
might
be
relevant.
thank
you.
