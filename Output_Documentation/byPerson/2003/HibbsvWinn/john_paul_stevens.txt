justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
if
you
think
the
language
is
so
plain
that
we
should
not
even
look
at
the
legislative
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
judge
easterbrook
was
just
dead
wrong
in
looking
at
the
legislative
history
and
he
also
interpreted
it
dead
wrong.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does...
does
that...
were
you
finished
your
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the...
the...
if
you
use
the
word
enjoin
to
mean
command,
which
it
can
mean,
can
you
say
that
they
are
commanding
the
collection
of
a
tax,
contrary
to
the
words
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--does
the
arizona
tax
code
have
a
provision
in
it
comparable
to
the
one
that
you
read
us...
to
us
from
the
federal
code?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
it's
hardly
relevant,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
just
want
to
make
sure
i
didn't
miss
something
in
your
argument,
mr.
cohen.
talking
about
the
history
of
this
statute,
did
you
refer
to
an
earlier
statute
that
used
the
similar
language
in
the
same
order,
assessment,
levy,
and
collection
or
collection
and
levy,
whichever
it
is,
and
that
that
statute
only
applied
to
real
estate
taxes?
was
that...
did
you
say
that?
i
want
to
make
sure
i
didn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
it
would
be
perfectly
natural
in
the
real
estate
tax
context
to
use
them
in
that
order
because
the
assessment
comes
first.
whereas,
the
argument
of
your
opponents
here
is
the
assessment
is
the
last
thing
in
the
chain
of
events,
which
seems
somewhat
counter-intuitive
if
you're...
when
you're
referring
to
income
taxes.
