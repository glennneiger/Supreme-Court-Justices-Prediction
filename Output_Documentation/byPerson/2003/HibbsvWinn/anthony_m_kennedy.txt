when...
when
does
that
happen?
when
the
return
is
received
in
the
office
or?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
you
could...
i
suppose
you
could
make
the
argument
that
it...
it's
wrong
to
say
the
state
is
only
interested
in
increasing
revenue.
the
state
may
be
interested
in
fairness
for
its
taxpayers,
giving
its
taxpayers
the...
the
benefit
of
the
lower
rate.
that's
certainly
a...
a
sound
state
policy.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--isn't
the
case
just
simpler
if
we
say
you
cannot
command
the
collection
of
a
tax,
which
is
what's
happening
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
wouldn't
you
agree
that
the
primary
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
protect
the
state's
fisc?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
insofar
as
that
purpose
is
relevant,
you
lose
on
that
purpose.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean
i...
i
can't
read
this
statute
to
say
that
the
district
court
shall
not
enjoin
the
collection
of
a
tax?
i
have
to
read
all
the
other
things
with
it?
that...
that's
a
very
strange
interpretation
of
any
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
statute
doesn't
say
stop.
it
says
enjoin
and
enjoin
can
mean...
can
mean
command.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
exactly
what
you're
doing.
you're
commanding
the
collection
of
the
tax.
