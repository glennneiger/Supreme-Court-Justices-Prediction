justice

where
is
the
assessment
here
that...
that
supposedly
is
being
enjoined?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's...
it's
a
self-assessment?
so
you...
it's
a
self-assessment
that's
being
enjoined?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
they
couldn't
stop
a
bookkeeping
entry,
i
assume
they
couldn't
stop
the
acceptance
of
the
tax
in
accordance
with
a
bookkeeping
entry.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
assume
it's
essential
to
their
case
that
they
stop
that
ultimate
bookkeeping
entry
which
determines
how
much
the
taxpayer
owes.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
keeps
a
record
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
he
must
keep
a
record
of
it
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
assume
it
means
just
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
let's
assume
that...
that
you
get
your
injunction
in
a
federal
district
court
against
the
secretary
of
state's
collection
of
this
tax.
what
is
the
secretary
of
state
to
do?
his...
his
state
statute
tells
him
that
he
should
collect
less.
this
injunction
says
he
should
collect
more.
he
will
appeal
the
case
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals.
meanwhile,
what
is
he
to
do?
he
is
not
authorized
by
state
law,
which
he
thinks
is
valid,
to
collect
more.
it
seems
to
me
during
the
whole
period
while
that...
that
case
is
on
appeal
from
the
district
court
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
the
supreme
court,
if
it
gets
here,
the
secretary
of
state
doesn't
know
what
to
do,
and
his
collection
of
the
tax
is
impaired.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
the
statute
wouldn't
apply
i
suppose.
it
just
says
it
shall
not
enjoin.
we're
assuming
it
has
enjoined.
if
your
reading
is
correct,
it
should
be
able
to
enjoin
because
there's
nothing
wrong
with
enjoining.
okay?
let's
assume
it
does
enjoin.
does
that
not
interfere
with
the
collection,
even
if
you
think
that
that's...
that's
all
that's
at
issue
is
the
collection
of
taxes?
how
is
the
state
going
to
collect
its
taxes?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
much
narrower
position.
your
earlier
position
was
this
whole
purpose
was
just
to
protect
the
state's
tax
revenue
and
so
long
as
it
doesn't
impair
that.
now
you
say
it
can
impair
that
so
long
as
it
does
not
enjoin
it.
that's
a
much
narrower--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
that's
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
bring
you...
can
i
bring
you
back
to
my
question
which
i
don't
think
i
got
an
answer
to?
what
is
the
secretary
of
state
supposed
to
do?
he
has
gotten
an
order
from
a
federal
district
court
to
collect
more
taxes
than
he
is
authorized
to
collect
under
state
law.
he
intends
to
appeal
that
district
court
order,
but
meanwhile,
he
has
been
enjoined
from
collecting.
what
is
he
supposed
to
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
means--
justice
antonin
scalia
he
believes
the
district
court
decision
is
wrong,
and
let's
assume
it
is
wrong.
what
is
he
supposed
to
do
while
it
is
on
appeal?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
does
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
suppose
the
state
law
says
if
these
tax
credits
are
invalidated,
all
other
taxpayers
shall
be
assessed
an
additional
2
percent
to
make
up
for...
i'm
sorry.
if
these...
if
these
tax
credits
are
invalidated,
other
taxpayers
shall
be...
their
taxes
shall
be
reduced
by
1
percent.
okay?
i
mean,
the...
the
state
looks
forward
to
this
possibility
that
there
will
be
an
injunction.
what
is
the
secretary
of
state
to
do
then?
is
he
to
assess
everybody
else
at
a
lesser
amount?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
he
is
prevented
from
collecting
the
additional
amount
that
he
would
have
had
to
collect
from
other
taxpayers
had
this
tax
credit
been
acknowledged.
the
tax
credit
is
struck
down,
and
what
the
law
says
is,
if
it's
struck
down,
you
have
to
collect
more
from
everybody
else.
now,
i
assume
in
that
situation
the
district
court
would
not
be
able
to
enjoin
the
collection,
would
it?
so
all
you're
talking
about
is
whether
the
state
law
is...
is
drafted
in
a
clever
way
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
isn't
and;
it's
or.
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wasn't
done
that
way.
i
mean,
it's
just
like
saying
it
could
have
been
extracted
by
torture
too,
and
that
would
have
been
clearly
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
happens
not
to
be
the
way
it
was
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
do.
i
do
have
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
go
on.
go
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
question
i
was
going
to
put
was
you...
you
say
that
the...
the
principal
purpose
of
this
law
was
to
protect
the
fisc
of
the
state.
and
i...
you
know,
i
will
concede
that,
that...
that
what
congress
was
most
concerned
about
was
preventing
somebody
from
stopping
the
state
from
collecting
money.
but
it's
not
unusual
that
congress
drafts
its
prohibitions
broader
than
is
necessary
to
achieve
just
the
narrow
purpose.
and
if
indeed
they...
they
prohibited
not
just
stopping
the
collection
but
also
stopping
the
assessment,
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
take
the
statute
for
what
it
says,
if
indeed
this
is
an
assessment.
and
the
mere
fact
that
it
goes
beyond
what
the
principal
purpose
was,
i
mean,
that...
that's
often
the
case
with
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
we
are
ships
passing
in
the
night
because
you're...
i
don't
care
what
the
purpose
was.
i
care
what
the
language
says,
and
my
point
is
that
very
often
the
language
goes
beyond
the
narrow
purpose
that
congress
had
in
mind.
and
when...
when
the
language
does
so,
we
read
the
statute
as
it's
written,
but
you
don't...
don't
agree
with
that
apparently.
we...
we
have
to
intuit
the
purpose
and
limit
the
language
no
matter
what
it
says
to
that
purpose.
