mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'll
begin
by
stating
what
our
position
is.
the
tax
injunction
act
and
the
associated
principles
of
comity
only...
only...
apply
when
a
district
court
is
asked
to
stop
the
flow
of
revenue
to
the
state.
for
more
than
60
years,
the
act
and
the
associated
principles
of
comity
have
been
applied
only
when
claimants
sought
to
stop
the
flow
of
tax
revenues.
the
decisions
of
this
court
support
this.
in
challenges
to
tax
credits,
the
tax
injunction
act
has
been
either
not
considered
at
all
by
this
court
or
in
other
federal
courts
has
specifically...
they've
specifically
held,
except
in
bridges
last
summer...
they've
specifically
held
that
the
tax
injunction
act
did
not
apply.
it...
this
is...
also
our
position
is
consistent
with
the
revenue
protective
purpose
of
the
tax
injunction
act
and
common
sense
supports
this.
if
there's
no
threat
to
the
flow
of
state
revenue...
state
tax
revenues,
then
the
administration
of
the
state
tax
laws
is
the
same
as
the
administration
of
education
laws
and
penal
laws--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
question
that.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
your
honor,
we
view
the
phrase,
enjoin,
suspend,
or
restrain
the
assessment,
levy,
or
collection,
as
a
phrase.
we...
we
don't
believe
that
any
one
word
there
has
special
meanings.
that
phrase
has
been
interpreted
by
the
courts
to
say
that
the
process
of
causing
a
flow
of
tax
revenues
to
the
state
will
not
be
stopped.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
justice
kennedy,
the...
let's
take
a...
i...
i
believe
the
idea
was
that
there
is
a
process.
the...
at
the
time
the
word
assessment
was
first
used,
it
was
1867
in
the
federal
anti-injunction
act,
which
was
the
model
for
the
tax
injunction
act
in
1937,
as
this
court
held
in
jefferson
county.
and
at
that
time
if
a...
and
a...
the
assessment
process
which
was
valuing
property...
if
that
had
been
stopped,
then...
then
they
wouldn't
get
to
the
collection
phase,
or
if
they
stopped
the
levy
phase,
they
wouldn't
get
to
the
collection
phase.
so
it's
a...
the
concept
was
that
it
took
these
three
things
to
make
the
flow
of
revenue
come
to
the
state.
and
that
while
individuals
have
an
option
under
the
section
1983
and
1343
together
to
choose
either
the
federal
or
state
courts
in
which
to
vindicate
their
constitutional
rights,
the
congress
decided
that
they
should
not
have
that
option
if
it
could
interfere...
if
it
could
stop
the
flow
of
revenues
to
the
state--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--but
it
didn't
go
farther
than
that.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
yes.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
justice
scalia--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--the...
two...
two
answers,
if...
if
you
allow
me.
the
first
is
that
the
district
court,
of
course,
has
the
power
to
stay
the
effectiveness
of
that
judgment
until
there
is
a
final
decision,
and
he
could
be
asked--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--justice
scalia,
the
statute
does
not
say
interfere.
the
statute
talks
about
stopping
the
collection,
and
this
would
not
stop
the
collection.
it
would...
it
would
allow
the
collection--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--justice
scalia,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i...
i...
you--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--i
must
have
misspoke
myself
because
what
i
am
saying
is
that
they
can't
stop
the
collection
of
taxes
and
that
this
would
not
stop
the
collection.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
in
jefferson--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--justice
kennedy,
in
jefferson
county,
this
court
unanimously
interpreted
the
statute
to
say
stop
the
collection.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
jefferson
county,
and
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
which
a
commandment
seeking
to
command
the
payment
of
taxes
has
been
held
to
be
outside
the
tax
injunction
act.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
justice
scalia,
he
obeys
the
order
of
the
court
and
he's...
he's
only
enjoined
from--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--he's
only
enjoined
with
regard
to
the
tax
credit.
he's
not
enjoined
from
collecting
the
tax
which
includes
not
honoring
the
tax
credit.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
unless
it...
your
honor,
unless
it
is
stayed,
he
is
to
obey
it,
and--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--it
does
not
interfere
with
the
collection...
with
the
flow...
it
does
not
interfere
with
the
flow
of
revenue
to
the
state,
and
that's
what
the
tax
injunction
act
is
basically
about.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
your
honor,
i
believe--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--your
honor,
if...
if
the
tax
credit
is
struck
down,
the
state
gets
more
money.
it
has
no
need
to
assess
an
additional
1
or
2
percent
of
its
taxpayers.
but
if...
if
the
state
in
its
wisdom
chose
to
do
so,
then
whoever
collects
taxes
would
obey
the
state
law
until
another
case
came
to
court
and
another
judge
told
them
what
to
do.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
your
honor,
justice
breyer,
it's
interesting
about
the
internal
revenue
code
and
the...
the
federal
income
tax
law
because
there
is
a
corollary
to
the
tax
injunction
act:
the
anti-injunction
act
of
1867.
and
it
uses
the
word
assessment.
and
there
are
a
number
of
federal
court
decisions
saying
that
that
does
not
apply
to
tax
credits.
and
in
each--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--may
i--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--yes.
none
of
them...
none
of
them
looked
at
the
word
assessment
in
isolation.
what
it
looked
at...
what
those
cases
looked
at
was
the
phrase,
as...
as
i've
suggested
to
the
court,
that
the
phrase
assessment,
levy,
and
collection
is
the
process
of
creating
the
flow
of
revenue.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
the...
justice
scalia,
it...
it
is
or
for
purposes
of
saying
that
you
can't
restrain
any
of
those
because
if
you
restrain
any
of
those
in
the
context
of
creating
the
stream
of
revenue,
you
have
stopped
the
stream
of
revenue.
and
that...
that's
what
history
of
the
act
shows,
the
purpose
of
the
act.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
i...
i
would
like
to
also
point
out
to
the
court
that
this
use
of
a
tax
credit
as
a
mechanism
could
also
to...
that
is
to
funnel
money
to
school
tuition
organizations
could
just
as
well
have
been
an
appropriation
of
dollars
and
vouchers.
and
if
instead
the
state
was
giving
vouchers
to
school
tuition
organizations,
93
percent
of
which
went
to
religious
schools,
there
would
be
no
question
about
the
individual
citizen's
option
to
choose
to
go
to
the
federal
court.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
nyquist
this
court
particularly
pointed
out
that
a
tax
credit
was
the
same
as
giving
money
to
the
state.
that...
that
was
this
court
dealing
with
a
tax
credit
that...
where
the
money
was
used
to
support
religious
schools,
which
is
just
what
we're
asserting
here.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
didn't--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--mr.
chief
justice,
mueller
was
a
tax
deduction
case
rather
than
a
tax
credit
case.
in
a
tax
credit
case--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--it...
generally,
it
wouldn't,
but
a
tax
credit
is
every
dollar
that
goes
to
the
benefit
of
the
school
tuition
organization...
if
it
wasn't
given
to
them,
every
dollar
of
that
would
go
to
the
state.
in
a
tax
deduction,
a
tax
deduction
is
a
more
generalized...
helping
to
support
charity,
and
only
a
portion
of
that
money
goes
to
the
state--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--mr.
chief
justice,
that's
correct,
but
it's
a
smaller
percentage.
my
use
of
tax
credit
with
nyquist
is
that
that's
an
unusual
feature
of
nyquist
is
it's
dollar
for
dollar.
in
mueller,
there
was
the...
there
were
a
number
of
considerations
when
you
deal
with
a
tax
deduction.
they're
a
little
different
than
tax
credit,
and
this
court
has
recognized
those.
generally
they
are
tax
benefits
and
generally
they
are
to
be
considered
outside
the
tax
injunction
act
according
to
the
cases.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
justice--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--justice
ginsburg,
that's
exactly
right.
that's
what
i'm
saying.
and
if
you
have
no
further
questions--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--justice
stewart,
i
was
referring
to
the
anti-injunction
act
of
1867--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--in
which
the
word
levy
was
not
used.
it
was
assessment
or
collection,
and
i
said
it
was
in
the
context
of
valuation
then
because
there
was
no
income
tax
in
1867.
and
that
could
be...
for
instance,
i
know
there
weren't
federal
property
taxes,
but
it
could
be
in...
in
valuation
of...
of
property
for
tariffs
coming
in
or
things
of
that
nature.
the
word
assessment
then
was
not
used
in
the
context
of
the
income
tax
laws.
that's
all
i
was
saying
because
there
were
none.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
i...
i
agree,
justice
stewart.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
mr.
justice
breyer,
no,
i
do
not
know.
we
haven't
done
a
survey
of
the
states.
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
justice
scalia,
the
state
contends
and
the
united
states
both
contend
that
this
statute
is...
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
stop
any
court...
federal
court
interference
with
the
tax
administration
process
itself.
and
the...
the
federal
court
decisions,
other
than
bridges,
reject
that
point
of
view.
and
this
court
rejected
that
point
of
view
in
jefferson
county
when
the...
the
issue
there
was
that
the
county
had
sued
in
the
state
court
against
federal
judges
to
try
to
get
an
occupational
tax.
and
the
federal
judges
removed
the
case
to
federal
court,
and
the
county
said,
well,
the
tax
injunction
act
applies
here
because
the
federal
judges
are
going
to
raise
state
tax
issues
and
this
federal
court
will
be
deciding
cases
having
to
do
with
state
tax
administration.
and
they
cited
the
kelleher
case
out
of
the
second
circuit
which
it
held
that
the
tax
injunction
act
was
so
broad
that
it
applied
to
tax...
all
state
tax
administration.
and
this
court
rejected
that
position,
and
this
court
i
believe
unanimously
overruled
kelleher.
so
we--
mr.
marvin
s.
cohen
--mr.
justice,
i...
i'm
saying
that
for
60
years
with
the
tax
injunction
act
and
for
150
years...
no...
i
guess
140
years
with
the
anti-injunction
act
that
is
the
way
the
federal
courts...
the
way
we're
suggesting
is
the
way
the
federal
courts
have
interpreted
this
language.
and
we
suggest
that
if
there's
a
problem,
as
long
as
the
tax
revenue
is
flowing
to
the
state
and
we're
not
interfering...
we're
not
stopping
that,
if
there's
a
problem
with...
with
that
system
that's
been
there
now
for,
oh,
60
years
for
states,
140
years
for
the
federal
fisc,
if
there's
a
problem,
the
states
can
take
that
problem
to
congress
to
change
this
exemption.
this
is
an
exemption
from
the
federal
jurisdiction,
which
under
the
phillips
case
is
to
be
narrowly
construed.
if...
if
they...
if
there's
a
real
problem...
and
i
suggest
there
is
not
because
the
money
will
continue
to
flow
to
the
state
notwithstanding
our...
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
here.
and
we
believe
that
the
law
should
not
be
changed
and
we
request
that
the...
this
court
remain
with
the
past
60
years
and
140
years
of
judicial
experience
on
this
issue.
thank
you
very--
