well,
is
it
the
case,
though,
that
other
courts
of
appeal
at
the
federal
level
have
concluded
that
the
tax
injunction
act
does
not
bar
suits
that
would
increase
state
revenues
rather
than
reduce
them,
that
the
purpose
of
the
tax
injunction
act
was
to
prevent
reduction
of
state
tax
revenues,
specifically
by
corporations
coming
in
and
getting
injunctions
and
preventing
the
state
from
receiving
revenues,
but
that
it
doesn't
apply
where
the
effect
of
the...
the
suit
would
be
to
increase
the
state's
coffers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
first
of
all,
with
the
courts
of
appeal,
the
majority
have
so
held,
i
guess,
who
have
addressed
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
only
the
fifth
circuit
has
gone
the
other
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
others
went
the
other
way
on
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
seventh,
the
eighth,
and
the
ninth.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
know
about
that,
but
a...
a
challenge
to
a
tax
credit
i
think
is
what
we're
talking
about.
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
curious
that
the
moore's
federal
practice
and
wright
and
miller
and
hart
and
wechsler
all
suggest
that
the
tax
injunction
act
does
not
prevent
a
challenge
in
federal
court
to
the
constitutionality
of
state
tax
credits.
they
seem
uniform
in
that
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
they
speak
in
terms
of
tax
credits.
has
this
court
taken
some
cases
that
appear
to
fly
in
the
face
of
your
theory
and
just
not
said
anything
about
it?
