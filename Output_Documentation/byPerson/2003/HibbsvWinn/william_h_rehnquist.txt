we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1809,
j.
elliott
hibbs
v.
kathleen
winn.
we'll
wait
just
a
moment
general
goddard.
very
well,
general
goddard.
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
goddard,
the...
what
we've
been
talking
about
is
this
section
of
1341
that
talks
about
assessment,
levy,
or
collection
of
any
debt.
those
three
words
fit
perfectly
into
a
property
tax
scheme.
they
really
don't
fit
nearly
as
well
into
an
income
tax
scheme.
are
there
cases
from
courts
of
appeals
that
say
that
the...
the
act
does
apply
to
income
tax
as
well
as
property
tax?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
goddard.
mr.
hungar,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hungar.
mr.
cohen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
going
back
to
the
language,
assessment,
levy,
or
collection
of
any
tax,
which
was
the
subject
of
questions
to
your...
your
opponent,
you
don't
question,
do
you,
that
the
statute
applies
to
income
taxes
as
well
as
to
property
taxes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
would
you
question
its
applicability
if
the...
the
state
could
not
point
to
a
particular
act
of
assessment
or
levy
or
collection
in
its
procedures?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mueller
certainly
distinguished
that
part
of
nyquist.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
mueller
against
allen
case
surely
distinguished
that
part
of
nyquist.
i
mean,
it's
much
less
valuable
to...
after
mueller
than
it
was
before
mueller.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should...
why
should
that
make
any
difference
to
your
argument?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
it
may
be...
it
may
be
a
smaller
amount,
but
in
both
cases
it
goes
to
the
person
who...
who
claims
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
general
goddard,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
goddard.
the
case
is
submitted.
