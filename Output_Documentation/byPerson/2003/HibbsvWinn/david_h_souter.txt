because
i...
i
assume
that
assessment
is...
is...
the
assessment
that
we're
concerned
with
is...
is
within
the
meaning
of
federal
law.
but
let
me
just
ask
you
this
question.
do
you
have
a
statute
in
arizona
that
in
effect
says
what
the
department
does
with
respect
to
each
taxpayer
is
to
assess
that
taxpayer?
does...
does
that
word
occur
as
a
statement
for
some
technical
function
that
you
go
through
with
respect
to
every
taxpayer
within
the
meaning
of
arizona
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then...
then
isn't
your
problem
this,
that...
that
there...
that
that
specific
word
is
used
in
the
federal
statutes,
quite
apart
from
the
tax
injunction
act?
and...
and
my
understanding
is
the
same
as
justice
ginsburg's.
it
used
in...
in
a
way
that...
that
involves
a...
a
predicate
to
the...
the
assertion
of
a
lien
or...
or
steps
to
collect
a
deficiency.
and...
and
that
doesn't
seem
to
be
what
is
involved
here.
isn't...
isn't
that
a
problem
for
you
in
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
no
issue
of
a
levy
going
on
here,
and
they're
not
trying
to
stop
you
from
collecting
anything.
i
mean,
their...
their
argument
is
you
ought
to
be
collecting
more,
but
they're
certainly
not
interfering
in
a
way
that's
going
to
leave
arizona
without
money
while
it
litigates.
what
they're
saying
is
we
want
to
litigate
so
that
you'll
get
more
money,
and...
and
so
that
i
suppose
that's
why
the
ninth
circuit
said
why...
that
the
closest
thing
to
a
word
involved
here
that...
that
might
let
the
statute
apply
is
assessment.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
didn't
think
it
did.
but,
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
basic
textual
problem
in...
in
your
case,
and
i
don't
understand
how
you
get
around
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
i
take
that...
i
take
it
that's
the
answer
to...
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
that
his
obligation
to
collect
the
tax
is
an
obligation
under
state
law,
and
once
he
is
enjoined
from
recognizing
the
credit,
he
simply
follows
state
law
and
collects
the
tax
without
reference
to
the
credit.
the
federal
court,
conversely,
doesn't
say,
you
go
out
and
collect
the
tax.
the
state
law
does
that.
is...
is...
do
you
buy
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
--he...
he
obeys
the
injunction
and
he
obeys
state
law
except
with
respect
to
the
credit
which
he
is
enjoined
from
giving.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
result
is
that
he
collects
the...
the
full
tax.
that's
the
way
it
would
work.
