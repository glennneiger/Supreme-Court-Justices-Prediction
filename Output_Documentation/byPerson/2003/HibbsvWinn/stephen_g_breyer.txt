justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
were
going
to
go
to
the
history
or
something
else.
i...
i
don't
want
you
to
forget
that,
and
the
reason
i
don't
want
you
to
forget
is
i'm
thinking
yours
is
a
plausible
interpretation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
could
be...
well,
i
mean,
it
could.
i'm
about
to
say
maybe
it
isn't
plausible
enough.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the...
but
what
i'm...
what
i'm
driving
at
is
that
the...
the
congress
might
have
said
that
although
federal
courts
are
in
the
business
quite
often,
along
with
state
courts,
of
deciding
whether
a
state
law
is
unconstitutional
or
violates
some
other
federal
law,
and
although
millions
of
state
laws
are
very
important,
we're
separating
out
a
set
of
cases
here
where
they
can't
do
it.
now,
one
reason
for
doing
that
would
be
we
don't
want
to
interfere
with
states
getting
money
that
they
need
for
their
business.
and
that
would
limit
these
words
to
interferences
with
collection
of
revenue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
you
were
about
to
explain
to
me
why--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there's
evidence
that
congress
wanted
to
do
more
than
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
wanted
to
do
more
than
that.
it
wanted,
in
fact,
to
say
you
just
can't
stop
them
from...
you
cannot,
federal
courts,
go
and
have
our
tax
division
here
interfered
with,
even
though
it
doesn't
affect
collection
of
revenue.
we...
we
don't
want
you
to
interfere
with
their
rules,
with
their
administration,
with
anything.
you
can
do
it
for
the
police
department,
but
not
the
tax.
all
right.
now...
now,
what's
the
evidence
that's
what...
what
congress
wanted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
the
words...
i
think
they're
pretty
ambiguous.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
go
beyond
these
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
don't
have
to
send
them
a
notice
of...
in
other
words,
i
file
my
income
tax.
i
thought
there's
some
provisions
that
say
if
somebody
thinks
i
made
a
mistake,
they
have
to
send
me
some
special
notice.
some
process
takes
place.
we
have
some
other
case
on
this.
i
thought
all
that
involved
an
assessment,
that
it
was
a
particular
thing
under
the
irc,
not
just
my
filing
of
a...
of
the
return.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
just
said
to
justice
ginsburg
that
if
nothing
happens...
like
i
try
to
pay
my
taxes
accurately.
so
i
file
these
pieces
of
paper.
and
now,
nothing
happens.
they
just
take
the
money.
they
cash
the
check.
and...
and
you're
going
to
say
when
that's
all
that
happened,
there
was
an
assessment?
i
thought
it
had
a
particular
meaning
that
wasn't
that,
that
was
when
you
thought
i
was
wrong,
you
did
something
and
then
went
after
me.
but...
but
it
just...
everybody
is
called
an
assessment?
does
it
say
that
in
the
code
where--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so...
so
there
would
be
some
interference.
but
what
do
you
do
about
the
word?
i
mean,
i'm
somewhat
shaken
by
the
fact
that
the...
the
internal
revenue
code
does...
as
i
have
just
read
6201
and
6203,
it
does
use
that
word
assessment
as
apparently
to
refer
simply
to
the
record
keeping
function
of
the
tax
division
which
it
says
under
rules
and
regulations
the
assessment
shall
be
made
by
recording
the
liability
of
the
taxpayer
in
the
office
of
the
secretary.
and
therefore,
what
it
seems
to
have
in
mind
in
the
irc
is
a
simple
bookkeeping
notation
of
how
much
money
this
taxpayer
owes
which
takes
place
in
every
case.
now,
the...
the
act
says
there
shall
be
no
suit
that
restrains
the
assessment
of
that
tax;
i.e.,
you
cannot
restrain
the
secretary
in
noting
the
amount
that
the
taxpayer
owes.
now,
they're
saying
stop
right
there.
end
of
the
matter.
now,
what
in
your
opinion
overcomes
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
an
answer
for
the
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
they're
saying
they're
wrong,
just
as
they
say
we
were
wrong
in
five
cases
not
to
notice
this.
so
continue,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
answer
is
this.
you
say
indeed
they've
got
it
correctly
defined.
indeed,
it
says
assessment.
it
says
assessment,
levy,
or
collection.
but
that
phrase
does
not
refer
to
every
assessment,
levy,
or
collection.
rather,
in
context
it
refers
to
those
assessments,
levies,
and
collections
that
will
have,
were
they
enjoined,
the
impact
of
cutting
the
revenue
stream
flowing
to
the
state.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
view.
so
we
should
look
at
that
in
context.
that's
why
you
go
to
the
history
and
these
other
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
understand.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
this...
in...
in...
do
you
know
this
in
state
tax
systems?
apparently
in
the
federal
tax
system
assessment
refers
to
an
official
determination
of
the
amount
that
the
individual
taxpayer
owes.
now,
there
are
50
state
systems
plus
the
district
of
columbia.
do
you
know
if
there
are
a
significant
number
of
states
that
would
not
consider
that
official
determination
of
the
amount
owed
to
be
an
assessment?
