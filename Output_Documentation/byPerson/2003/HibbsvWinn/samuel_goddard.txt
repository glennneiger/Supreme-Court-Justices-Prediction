mr.
samuel
goddard
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
fundamental...
the
fundamental
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
meaning
of
the
term
assessment,
as
used
in
the
tax
injunction
act,
includes
arizona's
school
tax
credit.
as
this
court
has
written
on
several
occasions,
the
tax
injunction
act
has
a
very
broad
reach.
it
drastically
limits
the
access
to
federal
district
courts.
the
act
is
relatively
simple
and...
and
straightforward.
it's
just
35
words,
as
i
count
it,
and
it
specifically
says
the
federal
district
courts
shall
not
enjoin,
restrain,
or
suspend
the
assessment,
levy,
or
collection
of
a
tax
under
state
law
where
there
is
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
in
the
courts
of
that
state.
mr.
samuel
goddard
your
honor,
the
assessment
is
the
calculation
of
a
tax
by
the...
for
the
taxpayer.
in
other
words,
it's
the
bottom
line.
it's
the
plain
meaning
of
assessment
and
the
dictionary
meaning.
it
is
what
happens
after
you've
done
all
the
additions
and
subtractions
and
you
get
to
line
40
on
the
arizona
tax
return
form
which
is--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--your
honor,
i'm
not
talking
about
a
self-assessment.
i
believe
a
self-assessment
is
a
colloquialism
that
talks
about
what
all
of
us
go
through
as
taxpayers.
the
assessment
i'm
talking
about
is
what
the
defendant
in
this
case,
elliott
hibbs,
the
director
of
the
department
of
revenue
in
arizona,
does
both
for
individual
taxpayers
and
for
all
the
taxpayers
collectively
to
determine
what
the
state's
revenues
are
going
to
be
from
the
taxpayers.
and
the
only
way
you
get
to
the
revenue
is
that
bottom
line
on
the
tax
form--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--after
you've
done
all
the
credits.
mr.
samuel
goddard
your
honor,
every
taxpayer
in
arizona
has
their
form
calculated
by
the
government.
we
check
the
math.
mr.
samuel
goddard
no,
your
honor.
i'm
not
trying
to
say
we
audit
everyone,
but
technically
the
assessment,
and
as
it
is
used
also
in
the
internal
revenue
code
to
my
understanding,
is
the
assessment...
and
i'm
quoting
from
the
internal
revenue
code...
shall
be
made
by
recording
the
liability
of
the
taxpayer
in
the
office
of
the
secretary.
mr.
samuel
goddard
your
honor,
it
is...
it
is
our
position
that
the
state
of
arizona
under
our
state
tax
system
assesses
all
taxes
in
the
state
and
that--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--it...
it
returns
during...
excuse
me.
your
honor,
the...
the
activity
perhaps
is...
is
somewhat
fictional
in
terms
of
the...
of
the
director.
he's
not
going
to
sit
down,
as
in
the
old
days,
with
a
green
eyeshade
and
write
down
a
number
for
each
taxpayer.
but
he
does,
in
fact,
and
his
office
does,
in
fact,
calculate
the
gross
revenues
in
the
state,
what
credits
are
going
to
be
applied
against
those
gross
revenues,
various
adjustments,
and
comes
up
with
a
bottom
line.
and
that
bottom
line
is
our
dictionary...
black's
dictionary
definition
of
what
an
assessment
is.
mr.
samuel
goddard
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
every
taxpayer
has
a...
a
specific
entry
next
to
their
name.
that
would...
that
would
certainly
be
more
than
we
could
do.
but
our
statutes,
our
tax
system
in
arizona
does,
in
fact,
call
for
an
assessment
of
the
liability
of
each
taxpayer.
and
that
assessment,
the
entire
plan,
scheme
fixed
upon
for
charging
and
taxing,
the
webster's
definition
of
assessment,
is
the
bottom
line.
and
i
guess
that's
the
plain
meaning
that
i'm
trying
to
get
to.
mr.
samuel
goddard
your
honor,
i...
i
can't
say
that
we
have
that
specific
word
in
our
statute.
we
certainly--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
so
because
the...
the
first
step...
and...
and
the
three
words
in
the
statute
i
think
are...
are
certainly
helpful:
assessment,
levy,
collection.
what
essentially
the
congress--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--yes,
your
honor,
we
believe
that--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--no,
your
honor,
but...
but
what
we're
asking
for
is
that
the...
the
director,
mr.
hibbs,
be
able
to...
as
the
statute
says,
to
implement
the...
the
tax
system
under
state
law.
mr.
samuel
goddard
your
honor,
if
i
could
deal
with...
there...
there
are
two
questions,
one,
the
legislative
history
and...
and
the...
as
this
court
has
noted--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--no,
your
honor.
i...
i
would
submit
that...
that
that's
not
the
case.
mr.
samuel
goddard
the
fifth
circuit
in
aclu
foundation
v.
bridges
has...
has
very
convincingly--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--your
honor,
i
could--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--your
honor,
there
is...
is
language
in
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
which
speaks
about
this,
but
it
is
in
a
very
limited
sense
in...
in
dunn
v.
kerry.
i
don't
think
it's
applicable
here.
i'd
be
happy
to
discuss
that.
i
would
refer
the
course
also...
the
court
also,
as
our
brief
does,
to
first
circuit
u.s.
brewers
v.
perez
interpreting
the
butler
act
which
is
identical
in
language
to
the
tax
injunction
act;
to
kraebel
v.
new
york
housing
department
in
the
second
circuit
which
talks
about
a
tax
benefit.
that's
what
we
have
on...
at...
at
stake
here
is
we
try...
the...
the
respondents
are
trying
to
draw
a
division
between
all
state
tax
systems
to
say
anything
that
involves
raising
revenue
is
challengeable
only
in
state
court,
but
if
there's
a
benefit
involved,
if
there's
anything
else
that
accrues
to
the
benefit
of
the
taxpayer,
that
has
to
go
federal
court.
i
believe
that's--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
there's
any
logical
distinction
between
a
deduction,
an
exclusion,
an
exemption,
and
a
credit.
they
all--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--thank
you,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
that's
one
of
the
policies,
if
not
the
principal
policy,
behind
the
tax
injunction
act
is
respect
for
state
procedures
and
also--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that
distinction...
the
cases
i'm
referring
to
involve
both.
and...
and
you're
absolutely
correct.
many
of
them
are
property
tax
oriented.
that's
true
of
in
re
gillis.
that's
true
of
several
others.
colonial
pipeline
is
another
that
i
would
cite
showing
a
tax
benefit
not
a
tax
deduction
to
the
state.
but
the
most
precisely
on
point
is
aclu
foundation
v.
bridges
from
the
fifth
circuit,
interestingly
after
a
couple
of
other
cases
which
might
have...
which
have
been
cited
by
the
respondents
for
their
proposition
that...
that
somehow
the
revenue...
i
mean,
the
state
revenue...
things
that
give
revenues
to
the
state
are
significantly
different
from
items
that
benefit
the
taxpayer.
i
would
submit
that
under
this
scheme
and
under
the
scheme
that
this
court
has
discussed
in
the
six
cases
that...
where
it
has
discussed
the
tax
injunction
act
in
detail
speak
about
a
much
broader
application.
mr.
samuel
goddard
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
goddard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
goddard
i...
i
would--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--i
would
greatly
appreciate--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--well,
the
first
evidence
is
the
words
of
the
statute.
they
didn't
just
say
collections.
mr.
samuel
goddard
they...
well,
they
don't
just
say
collections,
though,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
goddard
they
say
assessment
and
levy.
those
words
are
not
modified.
mr.
samuel
goddard
thank
you.
also,
the
history
of
the
tax
injunction
act...
it
comes
from
a
period
when
the...
the
congress
was
reacting
to
this
court's
decision
in
ex
parte
young,
and
they
felt
that
extensive
equitable
relief
against
state
officials
was
inappropriate,
and
they
passed
several
laws,
the
johnson
act
and
the
tax
injunction
act
in
the
'30's
being
the
most
important,
which
spoke
very
broadly
about
keeping
in
state
courts
state
proceedings.
they
did
not
say
anything
about
just
collections,
although--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--your...
your
honor,
the...
the
congress
had
several
reasons,
and...
and
you're
absolutely
correct
that
one
of
the
primary
ones
was
not
allowing
taxpayers,
especially
out
of
state,
to
come
in
and
interrupt
the
flow
of
taxes.
i'm
not
denying
that
that
was
a...
a
very
important
reason.
but
as
this
court
has
said
in
rosewell
v.
lasalle
national
bank,
if
that
was
the
only
reason
that
they
were
concerned
about
the
collection
of
taxes,
they
could
have
said
so.
they
could
have
said
only
diversity
jurisdiction
cases
will
be
barred
from
federal
court.
they
did
not.
they
used...
they
said
essentially
district
courts
shall
not
consider
cases
to
restrain,
enjoin,
or
suspend
actions
for
the
assessment,
levy,
and
collection
of
taxes.
they
also--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--excuse
me?
mr.
samuel
goddard
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
samuel
goddard
it
was
an
assessment
on
property.
mr.
samuel
goddard
well,
i
guess
the...
the
direct
collision,
your
honor,
is
between
the
decision
below
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
aclu
foundation
v.
bridges--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--which
involves
a
challenge
to
a
specific
tax
benefit
given
to
religious
organizations
in
louisiana.
so
i
believe
that's
as
close
as
i
can
come.
your
honor,
if
i
could
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
i
would
like
to
do
so.
mr.
samuel
goddard
thank
you,
your
honor.
if...
if
i
may
go
to
the
overriding
principle
here
because
i
think
to
some
extent
that's
what
governs
the
actions
of
the
state
and
should
be
appropriate
here.
as
this
court
said
in...
many
years
ago
under
the
principle
of
comity,
which
mr.
cohen
referred
to,
comity
refers
to
the
scrupulous
regard
for
the
rightful
independence
of
state
governments
which
should
at
all
times
actuate
the
federal
courts
and
a
proper
reluctance
to
interfere
by
injunction
with
their
fiscal
operations.
that's
matthews
v.
rodgers.
mr.
samuel
goddard
your...
your
honor,
the
court
did
not
deal
in
any
way
with
the
issue
of...
of
section
1341
in
either
nyquist
or
mueller,
and
i
believe
under...
under
your
decision
in
debuono
there
is...
which
also
deals
with
1341
and
the
failure
to
raise
it,
there
can
be
a
presumption
that
the
escape
clause
was
exercised.
it
is...
if
there
is
no
plain,
speedy,
or
adequate
remedy
under
state
law,
obviously
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
is
appropriate.
mr.
samuel
goddard
efficient.
mr.
samuel
goddard
your
honor,
in...
in
the
anti-injunction
act,
that
creates
a
serious
problem.
in
the...
in
this
issue...
and
i
think
that
a
critical
thing
is
these...
these
taxpayers
have
a
remedy
at
state
law.
this
case
was
decided
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
in
kotterman
v.
killian,
and
this...
this...
the
supreme
court
denied
cert
4
years
ago.
the
exact
same
issues
that
have
been
brought
forward
in
federal
court
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case
were
decided
by
the
arizona
supreme
court
under
the
arizona
constitution
and
the
united
states
constitution,
and
there
was
not
an
establishment
issue
in
this
case.
and
that
brings
me
back--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--yes.
mr.
samuel
goddard
yes,
your
honor,
and
under
the
federal
law
there's
a
problem
because
you
can't
pay
a
tax
and
get
it
refunded
if
you're
a
third
party.
but
in
arizona
law,
there
is
standing
for...
for
these
parties
and
that's
already
been
exercised.
they're
trying
to
take
another
shot
by
going
into
federal
court
and
trying
to
get
an...
another
opinion
which
will
deviate
from
the
arizona
supreme
court.
and
excuse
me.
if
i
could
refer--
mr.
samuel
goddard
--your
honor,
i...
i
didn't
mean
to
imply
they
were
the
same
plaintiffs,
but
they
were
exactly
the
same
issues
in
turning
a
constitutional
violation.
if
i
could
to
justice
scalia's
earlier
question,
as
the...
as
the
legal
representative
of
the
arizona
department
of
revenue,
if
there
were
an
adverse
decision
in
the...
in
the
district
court
of
arizona...
and
our
supreme
court
has
already
spoken
on
the
same
issue...
i
have
a
very
hard
time
advising
a
client
as
to
what
they
should
do
going
forward
in
terms
of
honoring,
under
arizona
law,
the
school
tax
credit.
mr.
samuel
goddard
yes,
your
honor,
but
in
the
situation
in
habeas,
we
don't
have
the
tax
injunction
act.
we
don't
have
a
specific
legislative
bar
that
says
there
will
not
be
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
if
there
is
a
plain,
speedy,
and
efficient
remedy
at
the
state
court.
and
i
believe
that
is...
it
doesn't
tolerate
any...
any
degrees
of
variation.
as
this
court
has
said,
it's...
it's
automatic.
there
is...
it
is...
there
are
no
exceptions.
