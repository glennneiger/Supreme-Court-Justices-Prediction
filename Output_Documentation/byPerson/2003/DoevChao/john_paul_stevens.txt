justice
john
paul
stevens
but
have
any
of
those
cases
involved
disclosure
of
social
security
numbers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
this
seems
to
me
a
particular
kind
of
disclosure
that
might
happen
over
and
over
again
in
a
very
casual
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
pursuant
to
a
policy
such
as
they
had
here
of
that's
the
way
they
use
to
identify...
driver's
license
they
use
it
on,
the
holiday
inn
uses
it
for
their
social...
all
sorts
of
people
use
social
security
number
for
another
purpose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
that's...
if
that's
the
case,
i
don't
see
why
the
risk
of
being
subjected
to
identity
theft
would
be
increased
by
the
disclosure
of
your
social
security
number,
and
if
that's
true,
and
i
think
some
people
could
prove
the
risk
is
increased,
that
would
be
true
of
every
release
of
every
social
security
number.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
does
it
not
necessarily
follow
that
every
one
of
those
releases
causes
an
adverse
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
they're
bothered
about
it
or
not,
they're...
they
have
an
increased
risk,
just
if
you
increase
your
risk
of
death,
maybe
they're
not
aware
of
it,
but
it's
still
an
adverse
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
superfluous
with
respect
to
social
security
numbers,
but
the
statute
covers
a
whole
range
of
activities
other
than
this
particular
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
release
of
medical
information
doesn't
necessarily
increase
the
risk
of
any
particular
harm.
but
this
particular
information
does
increase
the
risk
of
an
identity
theft
for
everybody.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
not
true
if
you
say,
well,
you're
taking
aspirin
three
times
a
day
or
something
like
that.
so
what?
but
this
is
not
a
so-what
situation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
with
respect
to
the
parade
of
horribles
that
we're
confronted
with,
is
i...
it's
my
understanding
that
there
are
several
other
statutes
under
entirely
different
statutes,
they
have
the
similar
provision
but
they're
clearly
worded
in
a
way
that
says,
if
you
get
anything,
you'll
get
the
minimum,
and...
but
it's
the
position
that
your
opponent
contends
is
the
proper
reading
of
that
statute.
there
are
several
such
statutes,
am
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and...
and--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
most
of
those
would
not
require
proof
of
actual
damages?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
in
your
view
did
congress
come
up
with
a
different
formula
in
this
case
than
it
has
in
that...
in
the
pattern
of
statutes
that
those
represent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
statute
is
unique,
is
it
not?
