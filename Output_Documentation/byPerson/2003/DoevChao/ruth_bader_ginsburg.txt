justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask,
with
respect
to
that,
you
brought
this
case.
i
mean,
you
tried
to
get
it
certified
as
a
class
action
and
you
were
unsuccessful.
so
i...
i
hear
you
telling
this
court,
we
were
way
off-base
in
attempting
to
bring
this
as
a
class
action
because
the
adverse
effect
is
different
for
each
person.
so
you're
giving
up
on
your
first
loss.
i
mean,
there
are
other
circuits
that
might
say,
yeah,
why
not
class
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
say
you
lost
fair
and
square,
and
now
you've
seen
the
error
of
your
ways?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
stewart,
if...
and
before
going
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
this...
there
are
any
number
of
statutes
that
have
actual
damages
and
it
can
say,
or
the
statutory
damages,
and
some
of
them
have
this
formula,
actual
damages
and
person
entitled
to
recover,
and
then
there's
shades
in
between.
do
you...
do
you
really
think
that
congress,
by
using
those
different
formulas,
meant
a
different
result
in
what
would
seem
to
be
cases
that
don't...
are
not
sensibly
distinguished?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
willing
to
have
us
decide
what
was
not...
what
it
was
over,
that
there
is
an
adverse
effect?
in
fact,
the...
the
government
didn't
dispute
that,
didn't
dispute
adverse
effect,
did
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stewart,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
with
respect
to
that?
suppose
this
doe
said,
i'm
very
concerned
about
the
impact
of
this
on
my
credit
rating,
so
i'm
going
to
spend
$10
to
a
credit...
credit
reporting
company
to
find
out
whether
there's
been
any
theft
of
my
identity,
$10.
would
there
then
be
a
claim
under
this
statute
for
actual
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
made...
it
made
me
think
that
if
there's
ambiguity
in
this
statute,
that
wouldn't
have
made
much
sense
for
congress
to
write
a
statute
like
this
where,
to
meet
the
actual
damage
requirement,
all
you
have
to
do
is
make
a
$10
expense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
not
just
not
contrived,
because
now
it's
a
formula
for...
for
all
the
people
who
have
this
kind
of
complaint,
so
i
think
if
that's
what...
what
the
line
is,
then
mr.
doe,
is
it,
all
the
future
mr.
does
will
ask
to
have
their
credit
checked.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
a
number
of
them
that
start
out
with
actual
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
there
was
an
interpretation...
congress
told
omb
to
do
interpretive
guides,
and
it
did,
and
it...
and
it
gave
it
the
meaning
that
this
plaintiff
gives
it.
it's...
it
read
the
statute...
didn't...
wasn't
that
what
omb
said?
wasn't
that
their
contemporaneous--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
said
actual
damages
or
1,000.
as
i
understood
the...
that
original
interpretation,
it
was
the
reading
that
the
plaintiff
is
putting
forward
here
and
your
response
to
it
in
your
brief
seemed
to
be
that
was
a
wrong
interpretation
because
it
didn't
take
account
of
sovereign
immunity
or
saving
the
sovereign
fisc
and
an
official
at
omb
said
it
was
wrong
and
it's
not...
no
longer
effective.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't...
didn't
congress
designate
omb
to...
to
these
guides?
