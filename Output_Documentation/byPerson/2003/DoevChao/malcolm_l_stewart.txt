mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
discussing
the
distinction
as
we
see
it
between
the
terms
adverse
effect
and
actual
damages.
and
as
one
of
justice
scalia's
questions
indicate,
the
term
adverse
effect
is
not
one
that
originated
in
the
privacy
act.
it's...
it's
a
term
of
art.
the
general
judicial
review
provision
of
the
administrative
procedure
act
grants
a
right
of
action
to
persons
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved,
and
i
don't
think
it's
the
case
that
a
plaintiff
under
the
apa
needs
to
show
that
he
has
suffered
the
type
of
harm
that
would
ordinarily
be
compensable
in
damages.
because
the
apa
excludes
money
damages
as
an
available
item
of
relief,
the
typical
inquiry
in...
under
the
apa
in
determining
whether
a
plaintiff
has
standing
is
whether
he
is
likely
to
suffer
harm
in
the
future,
not
whether
he
has
been
harmed
in
the
past.
and
if
we
had
a
hypothetical
apa
suit,
for
instance,
challenging
an
ongoing
or
imminent
program
by
which
the
government
intended
to
release
social
security
numbers,
and
a
particular
plaintiff
could
show
there
is
a
likelihood
that
my
own
social
security
number
will
be
released
in
the
near
future,
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
to
establish
that
that
person
was
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
he
would
be
suffering
a...
a
violation
of
his
legal
right
to
have
information
about
him
maintained
within
the
government's
files
and
he
would
also
suffer
at
least
an
increased
risk
of
identity
theft.
that
would
be
enough
to
get
him
into
the...
into
court
to
seek
prospective,
injunctive,
or
declaratory
relief.
but
those
certainly
wouldn't
be
the
types
of
harms
that
would
ordinarily
be
compensable
in
damages.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
he
wins--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--he...
he
wins
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
the
fact
that
a
plaintiff
can
win
under
the
apa
and,
in
our
view,
can't
win
under
the
damages
provision
of
the
privacy
act
simply
reflects
what
is
implicit
in
the
apa's
exclusion
of
money
damages
as
an
available
item
of
relief,
namely
the
view
that
agency
action
should
ordinarily
be
reviewable
in
court,
and
plaintiffs
who
can
show
that
they
would
be
injured
by
unlawful
government
conduct
in
the
future
should
ordinarily
be
able
to
get
a
judicial
order
decreeing
that
that
not
take
place.
but
plaintiffs
are
not
ordinarily
entitled
to
receive
money
damages
from
the
government
for
wrongs
committed
against
them.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that's
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
the
damages
provisions
restricts
the
availability
of
monetary
relief
to
a
person
entitled
to
recovery,
and
the
phrase,
person
entitled
to
recovery,
is
most
naturally
construed
to
mean
someone
who
has
not
only
established
a
violation
of
law,
but
who
has
established
the
prerequisites
to
an
award
of
compensatory
relief.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
one...
one
hypothesis
as
to
why
the
phrase
may
appear
as
it
does.
the
phrase
originated
in
the
senate
version
of
the
legislation,
and
the
senate
version
said
that
a
plaintiff
who
establishes
a
will...
an
intentional
or
willful
violation
can
collect
actual
or
general
damages,
but
a
person
entitled
to
recovery
shall
receive
no
less
than
$1,000.
and
so,
in
the
context
of
that
provision,
the
phrase,
person
entitled
to
recovery,
could
be
a
shorthand
for
person
entitled
to
recover
either
actual
or
general
damages.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
the
more...
i
think
the
more
natural
reading
is
that
a
person
entitled
to
recovery
is
someone
who
not
only
has
established
some
of
the
prerequisites
to
an
actual
recovery,
namely
a
compensatory
award,
but
who
has
established
all
of
them.
and
if
the
only
compensatory
relief
available
is
actual
damages,
then
a
person
who
hasn't
established
actual
damages
is
not
entitled
to
recovery.
but
even
if
a
plausible
argument
could
be
made
the
other
way,
then
the
canon
of
construction
that
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity
are
to
be
construed
narrowly
would
compel
the
court
to
read
it
in...
in
the
narrow
way.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--or...
or--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
if...
if
congress
had
intended
that
any
plaintiff
who
established
an
adverse
effect
from
a
willful
or
intentional
violation
would
automatically
receive
at
least
$1,000,
it
could
have
used
the
word
person
or
individual
or
complainant,
which
was...
which
were
the
words
that
congress
used
elsewhere
in
the
privacy
act
to
describe
the
individual
whose
rights
had
arguably
been
violated.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
exactly.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
the
other
point
i
would...
we
would
make
in
following
up
on
one
of
justice--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
we
have
to
infer
that
congress
or
presume
that
congress
meant
something
by
the
choice
of
words
that
it
used.
and
the
phrase
entitled
to
recovery
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--a
benign
fiction,
that's
right.
and
i
think
it
is
also
the
cause
that
the
phrase,
person
entitled
to
recovery,
is
used
very
rarely
in
the
united
states
code.
there
are
a
number
of
provisions
along
the
lines
of
actual
damages
or
$1,000,
whichever
is
greater,
references
to
statutory
damages
or
liquidated
damages.
but
the
phrase,
person
entitled
to
recovery,
is
very
rare
and
we
would
presume
that
congress
intended
something
specific--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
petitioner
is
correct
that
the
phrase
intentional
or
willful
has
been
construed
by
the
lower
courts
essentially
as
a
term
of
art,
and
the
prevailing
test
in
the
lower
courts
is
whether
the
agency
exhibited
flagrant
disregard
for--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
think,
with
respect
to
the...
the
language
from
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
that
you
quoted,
the
without
grounds
to
believe
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--right.
i...
i
think
what
the
courts
are
getting
at
is
something
at
least
akin
to
the
standard
that
would
prevail
in
a
bivens
action,
where
an
individual
federal
officer
was
sued,
where
the
question
would
be,
could
a
reasonable
officer
in
this
person's
position
have
believed
that
what
he
was
doing
was
legal?
probably
the
courts
have
applied
it
in
a...
in
a
manner
that's
slightly
more
deferential
to
the
government.
in...
in...
it
doesn't
mean,
however,
that
the
government
has
to
have
been
shown
either
to
have
intentionally
violated
the
law
or
to
have
intentionally
sought
to
bring
about
harm
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
no,
i
don't
think
you
need
to
decide
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
as
the
case
comes
to
this
court,
both
parties
are
in
agreement,
or
neither
party
contests
the
proposition
that
an
intentional
or
willful
violation
was
established.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
i
would
candidly
acknowledge
we
have
not
had
a
problem
with
enormous
recoveries
against
the
government
up
to
this
point.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that...
that
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
was
ultimately
dismissed
on
the
ground
that
the
social
security
numbers
were
not
records,
which
is
contrary
to
the
general
course
of
the
law,
which
is
that
social
security
numbers
would
be...
be
records.
i...
i
want
to
be
careful
about
this
because
we
are
not
arguing
that
exorbitant
liability
would
inevitably
follow
from
a
loss
in
this
case.
what
we
are
saying
is,
if
we
lose
this
issue
and
if
the
word
adverse
effect
is
given
the
same
meaning
in
the
privacy
act
that
it
has
in
the
apa,
the
government
would
be
subject
to
enormous
potential
liability.
to
take
an
example,
following
up
on
one
of
justice
breyer's
questions,
as...
as
you
pointed
out,
the
privacy
act
is
not
limited
to
a
prohibition
on
unlawful
disclosures.
it
contains
a
range
of
other
provisions
that
could
be
best
be
described
as
technical
or
even
bureaucratic.
one,
for
instance,
is
that
when
the
government
collects
information
from
private
individuals,
it
has
to
identify,
among
other
things,
the
source
of
authority,
either
a
u.s.
code
provision
or
an
executive
order
that
authorizes
the
information
to
be
collected.
and
if
an
agency
circulated
100,000
forms
and
left
off
the
u.s.
code
cite,
i
think,
under
ordinary
apa
standards,
any
person
who
returned
information
on
that
form
would
be...
would
suffer
an
adverse
effect,
because
he
would
have
been
deprived
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would
be
rare.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
you
could...
you
could
imagine
a
situation,
and
we
wouldn't
condone
this...
this
conduct,
but
you
can
imagine
a
situation
in
which
an
agency
official
gets
back
the
100,000
forms
from
the
printer
and
says,
oh
my
gosh,
the
u.s.
code
cite
was
left
off,
but
then
decides,
i
know
we're
supposed
to
do
this,
but
i'm
not
going
to
reprint
100,000
forms
for
something
like
that,
let's
circulate
them.
we
don't
condone
that
behavior.
it
would
be
a
violation
of
law,
but
it's
hard
to
imagine
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
everybody
who
fills
out
information
on
those
forms
would
then
be
entitled
to
$1,000.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
yes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
not...
not
as
to
buck
doe.
the...
the
magistrate
judge
held
that
each
of
the
plaintiffs
had
established
an
adverse
effect
simply
by
release
of
the
social
security
numbers,
and
the
district
court
didn't
expressly
endorse
that
view,
but
didn't
reject
it
either.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
you...
you
wouldn't
have
to
decide
whether
there
was
proof
of
actual
damages,
but
yes,
i
think
if
it
was
apparent
on
the
complaint
that
there
was
an
adverse
effect
but
no
possibility
of
proving
actual
damages,
then
the
suit
shouldn't
be...
shouldn't
go
forward,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
agree,
but
i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
agree,
and
it
may
be
that
to...
congress
anticipated
that
questions
concerning
damages
would
be
resolved
at
the
end
of
the
day,
and
there
would
obviously
be
a
lot
of
cases
in
which
a
plaintiff
would
allege
damages
at
the
outset,
and
therefore,
would
have
a
cause
of
action,
but
if
he
failed
to
prove
damages
in
the...
the
course
of
the
trial,
he
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
the
$1,000,
even
if
he
proved
that
he
suffered
an
adverse
effect
from
a
willful
or
intentional
violation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would
say
that
equitable
relief
is
not,
in
this
context,
is
not
specifically
authorized
by
the
privacy
act.
but
we
would
say
that
equitable
relief
would
be
available
under
the
apa,
and
the
allegation
would
be
that
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--agency's
action
was
not
in
accordance
with
law--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--because
it
violated
the
privacy
act.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
so...
so...
and
indeed,
this
suit
at
the
outset
included
a
request
for
injunctive
relief
against
further
disclosures,
and
the
government
settled
that
part
of
the
case
with
lightning
speed.
there
was...
the...
the
plaintiff
did
obtain
a
judicial
order
directing
the
government
not
to
continue
with
its
practice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
i
think
we
are
contesting
that.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
no.
we...
we
are
contesting
that
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
hasn't
really
been--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
and
let
me
backtrack
for
a
second
to
say
that
the
fourth
circuit
decided
that
mr.
doe
had
not
proved
actual
damages,
and
the
petitioner
did
not
seek
this
court's
review
of
that
holding,
so--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that's
right.
there
was--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that...
that's
correct.
my...
my
only
point
was,
the
reason
we
haven't
briefed
the
question
of
whether
there
were
in
fact
actual
damages
is
that
our
understanding
is
that,
because
petitioner
didn't
seek
this
court's
review
of
that
aspect
of
the...
the
court
of
appeals'
holding,
as
the
case
comes
to
the
court,
we're
assuming
that
there
were
no
actual
damages.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but...
but
to
answer
your...
your
question
about
what
the
government's
position
on
the
law
is,
our...
our
first
argument
is
that
in
the
context
of
this
specific
statute,
the
phrase
actual
damages
refers
only
to
pecuniary
harm,
and
we've
cited
in
a
footnote
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
with
respect
to
that
question,
and
that...
that
isn't
presented
by
this
case.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
but
we
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
there...
there
would
be
a
question
of
whether
that
was...
whether
there
was
causation,
whether
that
was
a
reasonable
response
to
the
threat,
but
in
theory,
an
expense
like
that
could
qualify
as
pecuniary
harm
and,
thus,
is
actual
damages.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
agree
that
it's
a
somewhat
anomalous
result
that
the
availability
of
the
thousand
can
turn
on
a
relatively
small
pecuniary
loss.
it's...
it's
somewhat
analogous
at
least
to
the
common
law
rule
that
punitive
damages
are
available
only
to
a
plaintiff
who's
shown
some
level
of
compensatory
damages,
and
there
also
a
plaintiff
might
be
able
to
contrive
a
small
loss
that
is
compensable,
and
thereby
make
himself
eligible
for
punitive
damages
that
far
exceed
the
amount
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
we
would
still
want
to...
we
would
still
have
to
know
whether
that
was
in
fact
a
reasonable
response
to
what
the
government
had
did...
done...
and
what
the...
the
threat
that
it
posed
to
the...
the
plaintiff.
and
even
if
that
kind
of
machination
might
be
possible
in
in
one
category
of
cases,
it
would
still
not
be
possible
in
a
lot
of
other
categories
of
potential...
of
privacy
act
violations.
to
continue
with
my
answer
to
justice
souter's
question,
the...
the
second
thing
we
would
say
about
the
emotional
injury
is
that,
even
if
some
emotional
harms
were
compensable
as
actual
damages
under
the
statute,
we
don't
think
that
the
particular
emotional
harm
alleged
here
would
be,
because
a
social
security
number,
unlike,
for
instance,
intimate
details
about
a
person's
family
life,
is
not
inherently
private
or
secret
or
confidential.
it's
not
the
sort
of
information
that
would
cause
a
person
to
say,
i
would
be
horrified
to
think
that
somebody
else
knew
that
even
if
i
could
be
sure
that
that
person
wasn't
going
to
misuse
it
against
me.
the...
the
reason
that
people
are
worried
about
release
of
social
security
numbers
is
that
that
release
may
lead
to
some
further,
more
tangible
harm,
identify
theft
or--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
and
we've
cited
the
metro-north
case
in
our
brief,
and
i
think
that
the
harm...
the
emotional
harm
that
he's
alleged
is
really...
really
very
similar
to
the
fear
of
cancer
as
a
result
of
asbestos
exposure
that
was
held
not
to
be
compensable
in
the
absence
of
some
current
physical
impairment.
so
to...
to...
follow
up
on
this
and
make
our
position
absolutely
clear,
we
are
saying
that
if
the
term
adverse
effect
is
given
its
usual
meaning,
and
every
plaintiff
who
establishes
an
adverse
effect
from
a
willful
or
intentional
violation
is
entitled
to
$1,000,
that
the
potential
financial
consequences
would
be
enormous.
now,
i
would
say
in
all
candor
that
if
we
lose
this
case,
it's
quite
possible
that
the
government
would
argue
in
the
lower
courts
that
to
protect
the
public
fisc,
the...
the
phrase
adverse
effect
should
be
given
a
narrower
construction
under
this
statute
than
under
the
apa.
but
our
basic
point
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there
are
a
lot
of
statutes
with
wording,
for
instance,
to
the
effect
of
a
plaintiff
who
establishes
a
violation
will
receive
actual
damages
or
$1,000,
whichever
is
greater.
most
of
those
don't
apply
to
suits
against
the
united
states--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
there
are
many
such
laws.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
under
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute,
the
plaintiff
would
get
the
1,000--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i'm...
part
of
it
may
be
that
most
of
those
statutes
are
not
dealing
with
suits
against
the
united
states,
and
congress
may
be
more
protective
of
the
public
fisc,
and
part
of
it
is
the...
the
legislative
debates
reveal
that
congress
considered
a
variety
of
potential
damages
provisions,
some
of
which
were
more
generous
than
the
one
that
was
ultimately
enacted,
some
of
them
less
generous.
for
instance,
the
more
generous
provisions--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
not
quite
unique.
i
believe
there
are
a
couple
of
other
provisions
that
use
the
phrase,
person
entitled
to
recovery,
and
that
phrase
has
not
been
authoritatively
construed
by
this
court,
so
those...
interpretation
of
those
statutes
would
raise
the
same
question
this
one
does.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and...
and
sometimes,
again,
the
words
are
to
the
effect
of
actual
damages
or
$1,000,
whichever
is
greater.
and
because
the
availability
of
the
$1,000
is
not
limited
to
a,
quote,
person
entitled
to
recovery,
unquote,
the
plain
language
of
many
of
those
statutes
compels
the
conclusion
that
$1,000
will
be
awardable
regardless
of
actual
damages.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
think
the
more...
i
think
you're
right
that
the
more
natural
reading...
the
omb
guideline
didn't
address
in
terms
the
situation
where
a
plaintiff
shows
no
actual
damages
but
nevertheless
claims
the
thousand,
but
the
omb
guideline
did
say,
a
person
who
suffers
an
adverse
effect
from
a
willful
or
an
intention
violation
shall
receive
a
1,000...
actual
damages
or
$1,000,
whichever
is
greater.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
think
if...
if
plaintiffs
are
using
the
omb
interpretation
to
establish
the
point
that
intelligent
people
can
read
the
statute
the
way
that
they
did,
i...
i
think
it's
validly
used
for
that
purpose.
but
the
omb
guideline
is
not
entitled
to
deference,
as
the
court
held
in
adams
fruit,
a
statutory
provision
that
is
to
administered
solely
by
the
courts
is
not
one
as
to
which
the
court
will
defer
to
administrative
interpretations.
the...
the
omb--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--congress
designated
omb,
but
it's...
the
particular
provision
that
is
at...
specifically
at
issue
is
reprinted
at
page
13a
to
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief.
and
it
says,
the
director
of
the
office
of
management
and
budget
shall
develop
and,
after
notice
and
opportunity
for
public
comment,
prescribe
guidelines
and
regulations
for
the
use
of
agencies
in
implementing
the
provisions
of
this
section.
so
the
only
specific
directive
that
omb
had
was
to
instruct
or
direct
agencies
as
to
their
substantive
obligations
under
the
act.
now,
in
the
course
of
doing
that,
it
was
entirely
appropriate
for
omb
to
go
further
and
offer
its
view
to
the
agencies
as
to
what
consequences
would
follow
if
they
breached
their
substantive
obligations,
but
that
wasn't
a
task
that
was
specifically
entrusted
to
omb
by
statute,
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
basis
for
inferring
that
congress--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--exactly.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
exactly.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
so
the...
the
last...
the
last
point
i
wanted
to
make
is,
it
might
be
possible,
if...
if
we
lost
this
case,
it
might
be
possible
to
mitigate
the
financial
consequences
to
the
government
by
giving
the
term
adverse
effect
a
narrow
construction,
but
our...
our
view
is,
if
the
consequence
of
adopting
plaintiff's
reading
of
the
phrase
person
entitled
to
recovery
is
that
an
established
term
of
art
like
adverse
effect
has
to
be
construed
in
other
than
its
normal
manner
in
order
to
make
the
statute
make
sense,
there's
something
wrong
with
plaintiff's
reading.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
guess
if...
if
this...
if
this
court
held
that
the
phrase
intentional
or
willful
was
limited
to
situations--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if
it...
if
it
was
limited
to
situations
in
which
the
government
set
out
to
violate
an
individual's
rights
under
the
privacy
act,
that...
that
would
be
another
way
at
least
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
mean--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
even
under
the
narrowest
possible
interpretation
of
what
intentional
or
willful
means,
you
could
have
hypotheticals
like
the
one
with
the
form
that
left
off
the
u.s.c.
cite,
and
again,
we...
we
hope
those
things
would
happen
very
rarely,
but
it
seems
highly
unlikely
that
congress
would
have
wanted
each
of
the
hundred
thousand
people
who
put
on...
information
on
the
form
to
get
$1,000.
thank
you.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
i...
are
you
referring
to
the
language
that's
in
(g)(2)
and
(g)(3)
of
the
statute?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
(g)(2)
and
(g)(3)
are
entirely
different
causes
of
actions.
those
deal
with
requests
for
injunctive
relief,
and
this
is
the
only
type
of
injunctive
relief
under
the
privacy
act,
injunctive
relief
for
access
to
files
or
correction
of
files.
those
are
separate
causes
of
action.
in
fact,
i
submit,
justice
scalia--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that
the
contrast
in
the
language
between
(g)(2)
and
(g)(3)--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--and
(g)(4)
proves
my
point.
here,
congress
anticipated
that
there
is
a
substantial...
substantially
prevailing
party.
that
party--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
i
submit
that
a
perfectly
proper
interpretation
of
intentional
or
willful
can
include
conscious
disregard
of...
of
the...
of
the
legal
obligations.
that's
a
well-established
standard.
thank
you.
