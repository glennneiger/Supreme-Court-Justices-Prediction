justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
suppose
the
irs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
even
if
they're
not
class
actions,
i
have,
i
think,
the
same
problem
people
have
expressed.
in
massachusetts,
we
put
our
social
security
number
on
our
driver's
license.
i
have
it
right
in
my
pocket.
i
show
it
10
million
times
a
day,
or
however
many.
so
suppose
that,
you
know,
the
irs
releases...
california
wants
to
do
the
same
thing.
they
have
35
million
drivers,
and
the
irs
sends
them
a
list
so
they
can
check
it
out,
or
the
social
security
administration
does
that
and,
my
god,
there's
35
million
lawsuits,
$1,000
each,
that's
only
35
billion.
suppose
they
do
it
nationwide.
there's
200
billion,
and
that's
only
social
security
numbers.
all
you
have
to
do
is
read
through
these
14
pages
of
fine
print
of
the
requirements
of
the
privacy
act,
certain
days
have
to
be
met,
certain
deadlines,
and
it's
very
easy
to
imagine
bankruptcy
in
the
federal
treasury.
all
right.
so,
i
mean,
you
know,
trillions,
it's
easy
to
see
that.
i
can
make
up
hypotheticals,
which
i'll
spare
you,
but
you
see
where
i'm
going,
because
what
i
want
is
that
is
the
horrible.
and
when
i
read
the
horrible,
i
think,
my
god,
they're
right.
now,
you
tell
me
why
they're
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
just
make
up,
you
know,
it's
easy
for
both
of
us
to
make
up
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
what
are
the
protections
if
you
win
against
generating
millions
and
millions
of
lawsuits
with
billions
of
dollars.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
yeah,
i
can't
imagine
any
government
agency
that
takes
place
that
isn't
intentional.
you
always
have
people
intending
to
do
what
they
do
in
the
government.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
nobody
released
these...
nobody...
nobody
puts
anything
on
a
piece
of
paper,
releases
it,
isn't
intentional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
in
other
words,
in
order
to
recover...
now,
that's
an
important
point
to
me...
in
order
to
recover,
the
plaintiff
has
to
show
that
the
government
individuals
or
the
agency
not
only
intended
to
do
what
did
violate
the
act,
but
they
intended
that
what
they
did
would
violate
the
act.
they
knew
about
the...
that's
willful,
it's
like
they
knew
about
the
legal
obligation
and
they
intentionally
violated
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
how
did
you
ever
win
this
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
our
concern--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that
may
be
true.
what's
bothering
me,
which
may
be
the
same
thing,
as
justice
stevens
says,
is
that
i
might
have
thought
that
a
labor
department
official
could
reasonably
think,
i
have
a
list
of
50,000
people
here,
several
are
named
john
smith,
i
want
to
be
sure
we
get
the
right
ones
so
i'll
put
the
social
security
number
as
identifier.
that
doesn't
on
its...
on
its
face
seem
like
such
an
unreasonable
thing
to
think,
even
if
it's
wrong.
and...
and
yet
we
have
here
a
finding
that
not
only
is
it
wrong,
but
that
it's
intentional
and
willful,
and
that's
what
brings
up
the
problem
you
come
to
argue,
and
i
don't
know
how
to
deal
with
it,
because
i
think,
well,
if
this
statute,
intentional,
willful
really
means
the
tough
thing
that
you
say,
well,
then
it'll
work,
then
you're
right,
there
won't
be
a
horrible.
but
then
i
see
this
case,
which
seems
to
me
to
stand
for
the
proposition
that
that
tough
standard
isn't
being
applied.
and
then
i
think,
my
goodness,
you're
opening
the
door
to
the
horribles
and...
and
i
don't
know
how
to
do
it
because
the
other
part
isn't
being
argued.
that's
my
honest
dilemma.
i
put
it
to
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he
is
entitled
to
recover
actual
damages
if
he
has
any.
justice
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
he's
entitled
to
recover
it
if
he
doesn't
have
any.
he's
entitled
to
recover
it,
whether
he
has
some
or
whether
he
doesn't
have
some.
so
i
will...
i
don't
understand,
you
say
the
most
natural
meaning
of
a
person
entitled
to
recovery
is
a
person
entitled
to
recovery
who
actually
has
actual
damages.
that
isn't
how
i'd
normally
read
it.
i'd...
i'd
read
it
somebody
who's...
who's
entitled
to
get
it
if
he
has
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
that
is
the
issue.
so
i
just
want
you
to
explain
a
little
bit
more--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--about
why
that's
the
most
natural
reading.
justice
breyer
or
just...
just
drop
entitled
to
recovery.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i...
i
would...
rather
than
do
the
presumption
of
what
they
intended
deduced
from
canons,
et
cetera.
you
assume
that
it
is
ambiguous.
you
certainly
got
me
there.
i'm...
i
see
it's
ambiguous.
and
i
also
believe
that
congress
did
not
want
to
bankrupt
the
treasury,
destroying
medicare,
social
security,
and
every
other
programs
we
give
$1
trillion
in
damages
to
people
who
have
the
social...
i...
i...
you've
got
me
there.
now,
how
do...
what
they...
what
your
opponents
say
is
that
is
a
made-up
problem.
it
doesn't...
it
isn't
going
to
happen,
and
the
reason
it
isn't
going
to
happen
is
because
these
words,
intentional
or
willful,
are
not
used,
the
word
intentional,
as
it
normally
is.
it's
used
in
a
very
special
way
so
that
they
have
to
almost...
well,
you've...
now,
you've...
i'm
cross-referencing
our
earlier
argument
and
i'm
at
a
dilemma
here
because
it's
not
argued,
i
don't
know
how
to
deal
with
it,
but
it
seems
relevant
to
the
underlying
question
that
is
moving
me
about
what
congress
intended.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
lower
court
thing
that
we've
looked
up
uses
an
or
about
that,
and
one
of
the
parts
of
the
or
is
without
grounds
for
believing
the
action
to
be
lawful,
which
means
that
part
of
the
test,
that
if
we
have
an
alj,
or
we
have
people
in
the
agency,
just
never
think
about
it,
as
they
might
not
in
this
case,
that
that
cover...
is
covered
by
intentional
or
lawful.
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
i'm
having,
because
it
makes
me
think
that
that
word
intentional
is
a
pretty
complicated
issue,
which
isn't
argued.
it
seems
to
be
very
important,
and
i
don't
know
what
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
three
of
them
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
that
won't
hurt
you
if...
if,
in
fact,
to
show
liability
here,
you
have
to
show
that
the
agency
officials
who
made
up
that
form
knew...
let's
make
it
really
tough...
knew
that
leaving
it
off
was
command...
putting
it
on
was
commanded
by
the
act
and
they
say,
ha
ha
ha,
i
know
it's
commanded
by
the
act,
but
i'm
not
going
to
do
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that'll
be
pretty
rare
and
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why...
why
do
you
say
that?
because,
see,
the
adverse
effect
part
governs
people
who
don't
even
want
damages.
i
mean,
it...
it's
to
get
into
court,
it's
just
to
get
into
court,
bring
the
suit,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so...
so
i
would
have
thought
that
your...
your
reaction...
i
just
want
you
to
clarify
this...
would
be,
if
they
win
this
case,
then
the
reaction
would
be
to
go
back
and
say,
all
right,
if
we're
going
to
give
$1,000
to
people
who
really
are
just
feeling
bad
about
what
happened,
we've
got
to
give
them
all
$1,000,
well,
it's
only
in
circumstances
where
the
agency
really
did
something
quite
wrong.
and
so
you'll
read
that
intentional
or
willful
requirement
toughly,
not...
not
the
adverse
effect
part
tough.
i
mean,
why...
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
reaction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see...
yeah?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
yeah,
and
then
you'd
say,
well,
we
should
assume
that's
what
happened
here,
though.
it
certainly
didn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
we
should
assume
that.
now,
suppose
i
assume
that,
and
then
i
decide
that
they're
right
on
the
basis
of
that
assumption,
and
then
in
the
next
case
it
turns
out
my
assumption
happened
to
be
quite
wrong
because
congress
had
a
broad
intent
there.
now
what
happens?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
assumption
would
you
like
us
to
make--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
respect
to
the
meaning
of
intentional
or
willful?
