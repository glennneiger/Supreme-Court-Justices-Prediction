--but
that's
so
easy
to
establish,
as
shown
here.
i
mean,
it
bothers
me
that
somebody
else
knows
my
social
security
number.
you
don't
think
that's
a
realistic
reason
for
not
assuming
application
of
the
statute,
do
you?
justice
sandra

o'connor
well,
but
wouldn't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--wouldn't
every
person
who
wanted
to
make
such
a
claim
make
similar
allegations?
is
a
class
action
a
reasonable
possibility
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
this
case?
how...

the
issue.

o'connor

justice

o'connor
mr.
stewart,
what
has
happened
in
the
28-some
years
that
this
has
been
in
effect
concerning
the
amount
of
recoveries
against
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
happened
in
the
1990
lawsuit
you
refer
to
on
mailing
of
irs
farm...
form
1040s,
that
had
a
social
security
