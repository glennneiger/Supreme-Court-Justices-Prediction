let's
assume
that
somebody
wrongfully
and
intentionally
releases
social
security
numbers,
you
know,
just...
just
a
whole
bunch
of
social
security
numbers
of
their...
their
entire
list.
they
sell
their...
their
list
to
somebody.
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
perfectly
valid
class
action?
every
one
of
them
has
had
the
adverse
effect
of
having
his
social
security
number
out
there,
and
every
one
of
them
has
this
same
adverse
effect,
which
is
the,
i
don't
know,
the
trauma
of
knowing
that...
that
your...
your
social
security
number
is
floating
out
there
where
anybody
can
use
it.
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
perfectly
good
class
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
those
numbers
are...
are
linked
to
names.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
campbell--
justice
antonin
scalia
--really
what...
what
justice
breyer
is
saying
is...
is
that
this
issue
of
willfulness
or
not
is
not
in
the
case
and
we
wish
it
were,
because
the
answer
to
that
is
important.
could
we
talk
a
little
bit
about
what
is
in
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
can...
can
you
tell
me
what...
i...
i
really
have
trouble
understanding
how
there
can
be
an
adverse
effect
without
actual
damage.
that's
a
very
strange
line.
i
mean,
in...
in
the
administrative
procedure
act,
you
talk
about
any
person
adversely
affected
or
aggrieved,
and
that's
a
person
who
suffered
damage.
it
seems
very
strange
for
congress
to
use
language
that...
that
sets
up
two
different
categories,
adverse
effect
on
the
one
hand,
and
actual
damage
on
the
other.
when...
when
is
there
an
adverse
effect
without
actual
damage?
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
actual.
it
just
means
that
it's
hard
to
quantify,
but
you've
had
the
emotional
harm.
why
isn't
that
an...
why
isn't
that
actual...
actual
harm?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
that
doesn't
answer
it.
the
harm
does
actualize,
as
you
say
it,
once
the
social
security
number
is
released,
the
harm
actualizes.
you're
at
greater
risk
than
you
were
before.
that's...
that's
actual
as
can
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that...
but
that's
not
the
question.
it...
it...
the
point
is
it's...
it's
not
only
enough
to
get
him
into
court,
which
is
what
it
is
said
adverse
effect
does
here,
it
is
enough
under
the
apa
to
give
him
judgment.
he
wins.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
is
enough
to
give...
to
make
his
claim
a
valid...
a
valid
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
reason
he
can't
get
money
damages
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
magic
words,
adversely
affected.
it
has
to
do
with
simply
the
fact
that
money
damages
are
not
available
under
the
apa.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
wins
under
the
apa.
justice
scalia
well,
plus...
plus
the
canon
that...
that
you
don't
give
words
a
meaning
that
renders
them
totally
superfluous.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
means
what
justice
breyer
suggests,
you
can
just
leave
out
the
words,
a
person
entitled
to
recovery.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
read
it,
but
in
no
case
shall
he
receive
less
than
the
sum
of
10,000,
of
$1,000.
justice
antonin
scalia
shall
a
person
receive
less
than
the
sum
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
a
benign
fiction,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
decide
that
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
like
a
lot
more
argument
on
it
before
i
decide
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
some
briefing
on
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
to
try
to
get
this
issue
out
of
the
case,
are
you
content
to
have
us
decide
this
case
on...
on
the
assumption,
just
for
the
sake
of
argument
but
without
ruling,
that...
that
the
act
requires
willfulness
in
the...
in
the
most
extreme
sense
that
justice
breyer
describes?
are
you
willing
to
have
us
decide
the
case
on
that
assumption?
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
indeed
there's...
there...
there's
nothing
bizarre
about
letting
him
get
into
court
just
on
the
basis
of...
of
an
adverse
effect,
because
he
can
win
in
court
on
the
basis
of
an
adverse
effect,
not
by
reason
of
this
act
alone,
but
by
reason
of
the
obligations
under
this
act
plus
the
apa.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
you're...
you're
saying
that...
that
it...
it
was
meant
just
to
tell
the
agencies
what
you
have
to
do
to
comply
with
the
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
that...
that's
probably
the
best
reading
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
to
your
point
about
the...
the
costs.
you
don't
get
costs
unless,
it
says
the
court
may
assess
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
and
other
litigation
costs
reasonably
incurred
in
any
case
in
which
the
complainant
has
substantially
prevailed.
and
i
assume
that
when
later
on
they...
they
say
the
costs
of
the
action
together
with
reasonable
attorneys'
fees
as
determined
by
the
court,
they're
referring
back
to
the
court
has
allowed
those...
those
costs
and
fees,
because
he
has
substantially
prevailed?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
am.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
right.
