well,
do
you
agree
that,
or
do
you
contend
that
adverse
effect
include...
includes
emotional
distress
and
that
you
have
to
show
something
like
emotional
distress
before
there
is
an
adverse
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what...
can...
can
you...
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
initial
question,
what
is
the
difference
in
adverse
effect
and
actual
damage?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your...
is
it
your
argument...
and
i'm
glad
we're
back
to
the
statute...
that
in
order
to
determine
in
this
case,
in
this
case,
whether
there
was
a
cause
of
action,
you
had
to
read
beyond
the
adverse
effect
clause
and
go
down
to
for...
or
before...
and
decide
also
whether
there
was
actual
damages,
before
there
was
a
cause
of
action?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that...
that's
an...
that's
an
unusual
way
to
write
the
statute.
it's
unusual
to...
to
write
the
statute
in
a
way
where
i
don't
know
if
i
have
a
cause
of
action
until
i
get
down
to
where
the
damages
are
defined.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
usually
i
would
say
that
any
person
injured
is
the
way
we
would
expect
this
statute
to
have
been
written.
