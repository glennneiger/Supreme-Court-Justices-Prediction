justice
david
h.
souter
before
we
go
further,
could
you
help
me
out
on
one
thing?
you
spoke
of
the
modest
$1,000
recovery.
the
argument
is
made
on
the
other
side
that,
in
fact,
it
would
be
$1,000
for
every
publication
in
this
case,
for
example,
for
every
caption
of
a...
of...
of
an
order
that
went
out,
to
everyone
to
whom
that
order
was
sent,
so
that
it
would
not
be
$1,000,
it
would
be
many,
many
thousands.
is
that
the
proper
construction
of
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if...
what
if
there
had
been
an
initial
disclosure
and
he
had
protested
it?
he
said,
you're
violating
the
statute
when
you
do
this
and
they
did
it
again.
would
that
be
a
separate
offense?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
you'd
have
temporal
separation
if
there
were
10
pleadings
over
a
period
of
10
months.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
in
that
case
you're
saying,
no,
there
would
still
just
be
a...
a...
a
one
violation
and...
and
the
maximum
recovery,
at
least
under
this
provision,
would
be
1,000.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
can...
can
we
just
go
back
to
that
for
a
second?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
we've
been
concentrating
on
willful,
and
you
say,
well,
willful
requires
a
very
high
standard.
as...
as
you
just
indicated
in
your
answers,
the
statute
doesn't
require
willful.
it
requires
intentional
or
willful.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
would
be
even
more
remarkable
to
construe
the...
the
term
intentional
as
requiring
conscious
disregard
of...
of
a
known
statutory
obligation.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
have
a
case
that
says
intentional
standing
alone
must
be
construed
to
include
this
conscious
disregard
of
a...
of
a
known
legal
provision?
justice
david
h.
souter
what...
what
do
you
say
about
the
position
of
the...
which
i
understood
the
circuit
to
be
taking
that,
on
the
assumption
that
there...
there
was
some
emotional
damage,
at
least
in
the
sense
that
the...
the
man
said,
i
was
very
upset
when
i
heard
that
the
number
was
out.
assuming
that,
i
thought
the
fourth
circuit
was
saying,
there
is
a
category
of
harm
that
is
generally
non-compensable
in
the
law,
and
we
assume
it
ought
to
be
non-compensable
here,
and
that
category
is
emotional
damage,
which
has
no
physical
manifestation.
and
the
general
policy
behind
that
is,
we
don't
allow
generally,
tort
law
doesn't
allow
recovery
there
because
it's
too
easy
to
fake.
and
the
fourth
circuit,
i
thought,
was
saying,
you
know,
whether
you're
talking
about
damage
or
whether
you're
talking
about
effect,
this
is
an
effect
that
the
law
simply
doesn't
generally
recognize
and
it
shouldn't
be
recognized
here.
that's
a
different
issue
from
whether
it
can
be
quantified
or
not.
what
the
circuit
was
saying
is,
you
don't
even
get
to
the
point
of
proving
quantification.
what...
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about...
even
if
there
is
no
physical
manifestation?
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
because
privacy--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
mean,
in
your...
i
understand
your
privacy
argument,
but
that's
because
the
invasion
of
privacy
or
the
infringement
of
privacy
is
regarded
simply
as...
as
injury
per
se,
and...
and
i
thought
the
circuit
was
saying,
that's
not
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
but
you're
saying,
what,
privacy
is
privacy
and...
and--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
it's...
but
if
that
is
so,
then
let
me
just
get
to
my
question.
if
that
is
so,
why
did
the
statute
go
into
speaking
of
actual
damage
at
all?
why
didn't
the
statute
simply
say,
if
they
invade
the
privacy
by
publishing
something
they
shouldn't
publish,
you
get
at
least
$1,000
regardless.
but
that's
not
what
it
said.
it's
keyed
it
to
actual
damage,
and
it
said,
if
there's
actual
damage,
the
person
entitled
to
recovery
for
actual
damage
gets
at
least
1,000,
which
is
something
quite
different.
it
does
not
take
the
position
that
it's
a
per
se
compensable
harm.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
take
it
you're...
you're
saying
here...
and
they're
not
here
because
there's
a
further
requirement
of
actual
damage
before
they
get
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
why
did
they
put
that
phrase,
entitled
to
recovery,
in
there
in
addition
to
actual
damages?
i'll
be
candid
with
you
that
i...
i
was
thinking
that
maybe
they
put
it
in
there
because
they
anticipated
this...
this
category
of
cases
like
emotional
damage
without
physical
manifestations
is
non-compensable,
and
that...
and
that
they
were
trying
to
leave
open
that
kind
fo
a
condition.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
stewart,
i...
i
take
it
that
even...
even
if
there
was
no
indication
of
actual
damage,
the...
by...
by
pleading
the
violation
of
the
statute,
he
would
at
least
have
pleaded
enough
to
entitle
him
to...
to
ask
for
a...
to
ask
for
equitable
relief.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
see.
justice
david
h.
souter
may--
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
may
i...
may
i
go
to
another
issue?
i
mean,
one
of
things
that's
bothering
us
is
several
issues
that
seem
crucial,
which
we're
just
having
to
make
assumptions
about
here,
and
depending
on
the
assumptions,
the
scope
of
liability
may...
may
be
enormous.
here's
the
one
that
is
bothering
me.
the...
the
government
is
not
contesting
here
that
in
fact
there...
there
was
some
kind
of
actual
damage,
even
though
it
was
not
quantified.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
but...
but
you're
not
contesting
the
fact...
let
me
put
it...
i...
i
misspoke...
you're
not
contesting
the
fact
that
if
he
showed
emotional
damage
and
emotional
damage
alone,
no
physical
effects,
that
that
would
be
enough
for
recovery
if...
if
a
fact-finder
said,
well,
i
think
the
emotional
damage
is
worth
$250--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
are
contesting
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
are...
may...
may
i
ask
you
just
a
further
question,
then
you
can
tell
me
which...
whatever
you
want.
are
you
contesting
as
a
matter
of
law
the
sufficiency
of
this
plaintiff's
testimony
to
at
least
get
to
the
fact-finder
on
whether
there
was
actual
damage?
he
testified...
i
forget
his
exact
words...
but
he
testified,
you
know,
i
was
so
upset
when
i
heard
that
they
had
released
my
social
security
number,
i
just
didn't
know
what
to
do
or
what
to
say,
something
like
that.
are
you
contesting
the
sufficiency
of
that
evidence
to
put
an
issue
of
actual
damage
to
the
fact-finder?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
said
he
didn't
prove
actual
damages
because
there
was
no
physical
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
they
didn't
say
that,
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
you
don't
have
the
emotional
physical
effect
rule,
he
wouldn't
have
had
enough
to...
to
get
to
the
fact-finder
an
actual
damage.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
didn't...
you
didn't
cross?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
as
a
matter
of
law,
this
is
just
what
he
testified
to
is
simply
too
de
minimis
to
be
considered
evidence--
justice
david
h.
souter
--sufficient
evidence.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
second
of
the
two
cases
that
i
have
to
announce
this
morning
is
02-1377
doe
v.
chao.
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
petitioner
buck
doe
applied
to
the
office
of
the
workers’
compensation
programs
of
the
department
of
labor
for
benefits
under
the
black
lung
benefits
act.
the
agency
then
used
doe’s
social
security
number
to
identify
his
claim
and
official
documents,
including
a
multi-caption
hearing
that
was
sent
to
a
group
of
claimants
there,
employers
and
lawyers.
the
district
court
found
that
this
disclosure
of
doe’s
social
security
number
violated
the
federal
privacy
act,
and
awarded
doe
a
$1000,
the
minimum
statutory
damages
award.
the
fourth
circuit
reversed
holding
that
because
doe
had
not
suffered
any
actual
damages.
the
minimum
statutory
award
was
unavailable.
the
fourth
circuit
thus
created
a
conflict
among
the
circuits
and
we
reviewed
the
case
to
resolve
it.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
court,
we
affirm
the
fourth
circuit.
litigants
are
not
eligible
for
the
$1,000
minimum
under
the
privacy
act,
unless
they
prove
that
they
suffered
some
actual
damages
from
an
agency’s
statutory
violation.
the
civil
remedy
section
of
the
privacy
act,
innumerate
the
penalties
available
for
a
violation
like
the
one
at
issue
here.
it
provides
that
if
a
plaintiff
can
show
that
the
agency’s
violation
was
intentional
or
willful,
then
in
the
verge
of
the
statute,
the
united
state
shall
be
liable
for
actual
damages
sustained
by
the
individual,
but
in
case
now
case
shall
a
person
entitled
to
recovery,
receive
less
than
the
sum
of
a
$1,000.
the
"straightforward
textual
analysis"
demonstrates
that
this
minimum
guarantee
goes
only
to
victims
who
prove
some
actual
damages,
and
hence
are
entitled
to
recovery.
although,
doe
sees
the
guarantee
as
a
form
of
what
is
known
at
common
law
as
general
damages
for
a
dignitary
tort,
his
reading
is
belied
by
a
drafting
history
which
shows
that
congress
cut
a
provision
from
an
earlier
bill
that
would
have
explicitly
authorized
general
damages.
justice
ginsburg
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
stevens
and
breyer
joined
and
justice
breyer
has
also
filed
a
separate
dissent.
