mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
it
is
undisputed
that
petitioner
buck
doe
suffered
an
adverse
effect,
the
emotional
distress
typical
of
a
privacy
invasion
caused
by
the
department
of
labor's
intentional
and
willful
violation
of
the
privacy
act.
the
only
question
is
whether
under
these
circumstances,
petitioner
is
entitled
to
recover
the
privacy
act's
modest
$1,000
statutory
damages
remedy.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
justice
souter,
and
let
me
answer
that
in
at
least
two
ways.
first
of
all,
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
has
already
held
that
the
number
of...
that
the
$1,000
is
key
to
each
individual
and
not
to
the
number
of
disclosures.
for
example,
in
the
tomasello
case
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
there
was
a
simultaneous
disclosure
of
information
about
a
single
individual
to
some
4,000
recipients.
that
court
held--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--and
i
think
correctly,
that
that
would
be
considered
one
disclosure
under
the
act
and,
thus,
the
individual
would
be
entitled
to
only
a
single
$1,000
recovery.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
that's
a
closer
question...
it...
because
then
you...
you've
got
the...
the
temporal
separation
that
did
not
exist
in
the
tomasello
case.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
but--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--i...
i...
i
think
that's
right,
justice
souter,
and
i
want
to
make
clear
too
that
for
each
of
those
disclosures
you're
describing,
there
would
have
to
be
an
adverse
effect
described
and...
and
a
causation
element
met
in
each
of
those
in
any
case
before
you
even
got
to
the
question.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
i...
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
o'connor,
the
answer
is,
yes,
there
is
a
real
harm
suffered
here,
and
adverse
effect
is
not
a
meaningless
standard.
and
in
this
case,
you
don't
just
have
a
situation
in
which
buck
doe...
it's
obviously
a
pseudonym...
just
alleges,
i
was
harmed.
this
is
a
case
in
which
he
submitted
an
affidavit,
and
more
importantly,
testified
in
open
court
as
to
the
severity
and
veracity
of
his
emotional--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--and
was
cross-examined.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
let
me
answer
both
parts
of
your
question.
as
to
the
first
part,
i...
i
don't
think
we
can
presume
that
plaintiffs
are
going
to
make
up
an
adverse
effect.
they
are
certainly
under
the
obligations
to
testify
truthfully,
and
in
this
case,
the
government
had
every
opportunity
that...
to...
and
did
cross-examine
mr.
doe
as
to
the
veracity
of
his
adverse
effect.
the
magistrate
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
he
did
suffer
an
adverse
effect,
the
district
court
adopted
it
and
the
government
never
appealed
that
finding,
so
whatever
arguments
they
have
at
this
point
are
gone.
second
part
of
your
question,
class
actions.
that's
certainly
the
parade
of
horribles
that
the
government
is
trotting
out
here,
and
i
think
perhaps,
justice
souter,
may
go
more...
more
directly
to
your
question
as
well.
the
answer
is
no.
even
if
an
individual
who
has
suffered
an
adverse
effect
caused
by
an
intentional
or
willful
violation
of
the
act
is
entitled
to
a
statutory
damages
award
without
being
required
to
quantify
actual
damages.
there
are
still
at
least
two
individualized
issues
that
will
exist
in
every
case.
one
is
the
pleading
and
proof
of
the
adverse
effect,
which
necessarily
may
vary
among
different
plaintiffs.
second
is
the
causation,
and
particularly
in
the
causation
question,
justice
o'connor,
this
is
not
a...
a
standard
that...
that
plaintiffs
lightly
leap
over.
in
fact,
there
are
a
number
of
cases,
one
of
which
is
the
oroquoia
decision
of
the
first
circuit,
which
was
handed
down
while
this
petition
was
pending,
noted
that
in
cases
where
the...
the
adverse
effect
alleged
is
a...
an
emotional
distress-type
problem,
you
may
well
run
into
causation
problems.
there
could
be
any
number
of
other
stressors
in
this
person's
life.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
well,
i...
i
think
that
the
example
you
give,
the
problem
remains,
particularly
one
of
causation.
some
folks
may
not
have
an
adverse
effect,
they
may
not
be
concerned,
i
think,
particularly
if
you're
describing
a
case
in
which
it's
only
the
number
that's
released
but
the
number's
not
linked
to
a
name.
i
think
in
those
cases
you
might
have
difficulty.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
i'd
still
go
back
to
the...
there's
a
causation
problem.
if...
if
you're
going
to
talk...
that
is
an
individualized
issue.
now,
i--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--i
don't...
i
don't...
i
don't
contend
that
there
aren't
arguments
to
be
made.
what
i
am
stating
here
is
that
there
are
some
very
strong--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--well,
we
lost
fair
and
square
and
i...
and
i
want
to
point
out
too,
i
want
to
give
another
example
of
a
case,
and
it's
one
of
the
cases
that
the
government
cites
in
its
brief
as
the
example
of...
of
this...
this
problem,
and
that's
the
schmidt
case
that
is
pending
in
the
western
district
of
wisconsin,
which
involves
a
putative
class
action
against
the
veterans
administration.
in
that
case,
the
western
district
of
wisconsin
held,
and
this
has
been
since
cert
was
granted
in
this
case,
held
that,
if
you
prove
an
adverse
effect
caused
by
an
intentional,
willful
violation
of
the
act,
you
are
entitled
to
statutory
damages
of
$1,000.
nonetheless,
that
district
court
refused
to
certify
a
class
on
precisely
the
grounds
that
i
am
describing
to
you
today.
so
is
it
conceivable
there
could
be
a
class
action
in
a
case?
yes,
it's
conceivable,
and
i
do--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--in
the
hypothetical
that
you're
proposing,
justice
breyer,
i
think
there
are
several
answers.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
sure.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
in...
in
the
hypotheticals
that
you've
described,
if
i
could
take
those
on
their
terms
first.
it's
very
likely
that
one
of
the
exceptions
to
the
privacy
act
disclosure
is
going
to
apply
usual...
if
it's
the
case
that...
that
this
is
a
working
relationship
between
the
federal
government
and
various
state
governments
and
the
like,
that
may
well
fall
within
the
usual
use.
there
are
a
number
of
these
exceptions
listed,
so
certainly
you
have
to
look
to
those
first.
have
to
go...
go
back
to...
this
would
have
to
be
intentionally
wrongful
conduct
by
the
government--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--certainly,
well--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--certainly
the...
the
intent
to
release
the...
the
information
would
be
correct,
but
that's
not
the
same
as
to
say
there
was
an
intent
to
violate
the
privacy
act.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--well,
in...
in
this
case...
i...
the
consistent
constructions
of...
of
the
privacy
act
is
it's...
it's
greater
than
gross
negligence.
it...
it
necessarily
encompasses
more
than
just
i
intended
to
do
something.
it's
that
i...
i
willfully
blind
to
my
obligations
in
the--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--in
pages...
if
i
could
point
the
court
to
pages...
bear
with
me
for
one
moment...
pages
90...
96--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--that's
correct.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
that...
among
other
things.
the
answer
is
yes,
justice
o'connor.
on
pages
96a
to
97a
of
the
petitioner's
appendix,
there
is
the
description
of
the
magistrate
judge's
finding
that
there
was
a
willful
violation
of
the
privacy
act
here
and
that
there
was
a...
there
was
no
attempt
even...
no
even
attempt
to
comply
with
the
act's
requirements,
and
i...
i
would
point--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--well,
let
me
amend
my
answer
in
this
way,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
willful
ignorance...
a
willful
ignoring
of
the
act's
requirements
would
qualify
as
a
willful...
and
i...
i
want
to--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--well,
the
department
of
labor
was
well
aware
of
what
the
privacy
act's
requirements
were
and
made
no
attempt
to
get
the
administrative
law
judges
to
comply,
and...
and
i
want
to
go
back
here
this...
to
one
of
the
answers
i
gave
with
respect
to
your
adverse
effect
questions.
this
issue
was
decided
by
the
magistrate
judge,
adopted
by
the
district
court,
and
this
was
never
appealed
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
the
answer
is
no,
and...
and
certainly
i
acknowledge,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
justice
souter
and
justice
breyer,
that
in
future
cases
there
might
well
be
a
lot
more
time
spent
litigating
the
issues
of
whether
there
was
an
adverse...
truly
an
adverse
effect
and
whether...
and...
and
whether
the...
the
violation
was
truly
intentional
and
willful.
but
i
want
to--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--sure.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
or
willful.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
let...
let
me
answer
this
way
in
response,
and
maybe
it
will...
will
help
ease
the
concerns.
for
22
years,
the
interpretation
of
the
privacy
act
that
petitioner
offers
today
has
been
the
law
of
the
land,
and
in
that--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--i
can't
cite
a
specific
case
for
that
proposition,
justice
souter,
but
i
again
go
back
to
we
were
talking
about
intentional
or
willful,
it's
a
high
burden
under
any
concept
of
what
intentional
or
willful
will
be,
and
for
years,
for
22
years,
from
1975
to,
at
the
earliest
1997,
when
the
sixth
circuit
decided
the
reno
case,
the
interpretation
that
i
am
offering
this
court
is
the
one
that
the
courts
of
appeals
had
unanimously
adopted,
and
never
in
those
22
years
had
the
kind
of
parade
of
horribles
that
the
government
posits
in
this
case
materialize.
indeed,
if
anything,
if
you
look...
there
is
a...
a
reporter
that
lists
every
single
case
decided
under
the
privacy
act
since
1975.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
none
that
i
recall.
that
seems
to
be
a
relatively
new--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--i...
i
submit,
justice
stevens,
if
it
happens
in
a
casual
way,
that's
not
going
to
provide
anyone
with
a
cause
of
action.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
that's
true.
it's
certainly
true
that
social
security
numbers
are
used
for
other
purposes.
but
what
is
clear
from
this
statute
is
that
congress
was
specifically
focused
on
concerns
about
social
security
numbers
being
disclosed
and
the
adverse
effects
that
can
result
from
that.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
i...
i...
i
under...
i
well
understand
your
dilemma,
justice
breyer,
and
i
again
go
back
to,
i
don't
doubt
if
this...
if
the
statute
is
given
its
natural
reading,
that
the
$1,000
statutory
damages
is
available
to
those
to
whom
the
united
states
shall
be
liable,
there
will
be
an
awful
lot
more
traction,
a
lot
more
fighting
over
the
adverse
effect
and
the
particular
circumstances
that
would
rise
to
the
level
of
an
intentional
or
willful
violation
in
the
future.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
that's
simply
not
an
issue
here.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
yes,
yes,
justice
scalia,
thank
you.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
i
think
there
frequently
can
be
an...
an
emotional
harm
that
is
not
quantifiable
in
dollar
terms--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--and
that's
very
common
in
the
law.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
i...
i
want...
i...
i
agree
with
you
that
that
is
an
actual
harm,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
government
is...
is
trying
to
cloud
the
issue
a
bit
in
this
case,
and
that
is
to
equate
actual
damages
and
actual
harm.
i
submit
they
are
different,
that
the...
in...
in
interpreting
the
statute,
the
deliberate
use
of
a
term
adverse
effect
and
the
deliberate
use
of
a
term
actual
damages,
those
must
be
given
different
meanings.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
yes,
yes
indeed,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
indeed
the
unanimous
position
of
the
federal
courts
on
that
question.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
if
that
is
indeed
what
the
fourth
circuit's
position
is,
it's
squarely
wrong.
at
common
law
and
intentional
torts
generally,
and
in
privacy
torts
specifically,
this
type
of
harm
is
compensable
in
some
at
least
minimal
way,
even
if
it
cannot
be
quantified,
and
i
think
that's
why--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--even
if
there
is
no
physical
manifestation.
indeed,
i
submit,
justice
souter,
it's...
there's
nothing
surprising
about
the
overall
remedial
scheme
here,
because
it
does
track
what
happened
at
common
law
and
intentional
torts
and
with
respect
to
intentional
privacy
torts.
in
fact,
the
privacy
act
is
more
strict
even
than
what
was
required
at
common
law.
at
common
law,
even
no
damage
at
all,
no...
i'm
sorry...
i
don't...
i
don't
want
to
get
back
into
the
confusion
over
the
terms.
even
if
there
was
no
harm
at
all,
there
would
be
still
be
some
at
least
minimal
award,
recognizing
the
invasion.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
here
you
have
to
put--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--well,
i...
i
want
to--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--well,
i...
i,
of
course,
disagree
with
your
characterization
of
what
subsection
(a)
in
fact
says,
but
let
me
go
back
to
first
part
of
the
answer.
we
are
talking
about
an
adverse
effect,
so
we
are
talking
about
having
to
prove
a
harm.
we're
not
just
talking
about
the
ability
to
vindicate
a
privacy
interest
in
the
abstract.
you
can
certainly
do
that
at
common
law,
and
congress
could
have
written
a
statute
that
allowed
you
to
do
that
under
the
privacy
act.
it
didn't.
it
did
at
least
require
that
you
demonstrate
an
adverse
effect
and
real
harm.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
the
difference
is
the
ability
to
quantify
the
harm
in
some
dollar
amount.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
i...
i...
i
would
certainly
agree
that
there
is
a
real
risk
of
identity
theft
any
time
there's
a
disclosure
of
a
social
security
number,
particularly
as
here
when
it's
linked
directly
with
the
name.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
i
don't
think
it
is.
there
could
be...
there
could
be
people
who
aren't
bothered
by
that
or
who
don't
share
that
fear.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
well,
i
do
not
contend
that
the
privacy
act
is
a
statute
that...
that
compensates
in
some
way
for
merely
increased
risk.
i
think
that
does
go
back
to
the
adverse
effect
here.
you
do
have
to
have
some
sort
of
harm
that
actualizes,
and
here
it
did
actualize
in
his
real
emotional
distress
about
the
disclosure.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
i
can't
support
that
interpretation
of
the
act,
although
candidly,
it...
it
probably
would
be
a
better
one
for
plaintiffs
in
the...
in
the
run-of-the-mine
case.
and
the
reason
is
this:
if
the...
if
the
disclosure
itself
is
the
adverse
effect,
what
happens
is
that
the
causation
language
in
subsection
(g)(1)(d)
becomes
superfluous,
and
i
am
being
careful
to
the...
the
text
here--
mr.
jack

--absolutely,
justice
stevens,
and
i...
i...
but
i'm
not
sure...
i...
i
don't
think
the
answer
is
that
it
would
be
just
superfluous
with
respect
to
social
security
numbers.
in
every
case,
if
the
release
of
any
information,
let's
say
it's
a
medical
record,
not
a
social
security
number.
if
the
release
itself
is
the
adverse
effect,
the
problem
is
that
does
not...
that
does
not
hew
to
the...
the
causation
language
contained
in
subsection
(g)(1)(d).
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
it
does
increase
that...
it
does
increase
the
risk--
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
--no,
it's
a...
i
agree,
justice
stevens.
it
does
increase
the
risk,
but...
but
for
some
people,
that
increased
risk
may
not
cause
them
an
adverse
effect,
the
personal
adverse
effect.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
jack
william
campbell
iv
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
kennedy,
i'd
like
to
address
my
first
point
to
you,
because
i...
i
think
you
put
your
finger
on
one
of
the
number
of...
of
absurd
results,
or
difficult-to-swallow
results
that
flow
from
accepting
the
government's
interpretation.
the
government's
essential
contention
here
is
that
quantification
of
actual
damages
is
an
essential
element
of
a
privacy
act
claim,
but
boy,
what
a
strange
way
to
write
the
statute
if
that's
what
congress
intended.
the...
the
relative
language
is
reproduced
at
pages
3
and
4
of
petitioner's
brief,
and
it
says
that
whenever
an
agency
fails
to
comply
with
any
other
provision
of
this
section,
and
i'm
going
to
ellipsis,
in
such
a
way
as
to
have
an
adverse
effect
on
an
individual,
the
individual
may
bring
a
civil
action
against
the
agency,
and
i'm
putting
another
ellipsis
there.
you
then
go
to
subsection
(g)(4),
which
states
that
if
that
adverse
effect
was
the
result
of
an
intentional
or
willful
violation,
then
the
government,
the
united
states
shall
be
liable,
in
the
sum...
in
an
amount
equal
to
the
sum
of.
liability
is
established
once
those
three
prerequisites
are
met.
all
that
is
left
at
that
point
is
an
exercise
of
arithmetic.
it
would
be
a
very
strange
statute
that
says
the
united
states
shall
be
liable
in
the
sum
of
the
following
amounts
you
are
to
add
up,
and
that
amount
would
be
zero.
and,
in
fact,
that
would
never
be
the
case.
costs
are
always
available
to
a
privacy
act
plaintiff
who
establishes
an
adverse
effect
caused
by
an
intentional
or
willful
violation
of
the
act.
so
there
are
certainly
going
to
be
at
least
some
recovery.
there's
no
qualification
of
the
costs
award
with
reasonableness
of
precondition
of
actual
damages.
so
some...
there
is
going
to
be
a
recovery
in
those
cases.
now,
if
that's
the
only
recovery
that's
available,
it's
a
very...
it's,
one,
a
very
strange
statute,
and
number
two,
a
statute
that
arguably
is
unconstitutional.
but
you
don't
need
to
read
it
that
way,
because
the
natural
reading
is,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
argument,
that,
yes,
congress
did
anticipate
precisely
this
issue,
that
privacy
invasions
very
typically
result
in
emotional
harms
that
inherently
are
not
quantifiable,
and
congress
didn't
intend,
i
can't
imagine,
to...
to
make
the
line
of
recovery
turn
on
whether
you
can
prove
that
you
put
37...
a
37-cent
stamp
on
an...
on
an
envelope
to
get
your
credit
report
or
pay
the
$10
fee.
that's
a
very
arbitrary
line.
why
would
congress
be
solicitous
of
people
who
suffer
the
same
harm...
be
solicitous
of
the
one
who
put
a
stamp
on
an
envelope?
that's
a
nonsensical.
moreover,
it
reduces
any
efficiency
savings
that
are
realized
under
the
act
as
congress
intended
by
saying,
look,
we're
not
going
to
get
into
those
sorts
of
proof
issues.
if
you
have
an
emotional
distress
and
it's
typical,
it's
caused
by
the
intentional
violation,
we
don't
go
through
that.
you
get
your
damages
of
$1,000
and
let's
not
go
through
the
proof.
that's
a
very
natural
reading
of
the
act.
but
the
government...
the
government
is
asking
you
to
adopt
a...
an
interpretation
that
has
a
number
of
additional
problems.
it
renders
the
adverse
effect
requirement
superfluous.
proof
of
actual
damages
will
necessarily
in
every
case
require
proof
of
an
actual
harm
and
causation.
so
even
the
attempt
by
the
government
to
place
a...
a
meaning
on
the
adverse
effect
requirement
must
fail.
again,
it
turns
the
shall
language
into
may,
or
at
best,
renders
shall
illusory,
because
the
sum
would
be
zero
in
most
cases.
