we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1377,
buck
doe
v.
elaine
chao.
mr.
campbell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's...
that's...
that's
a
very
strong--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--yeah,
very
strong.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--instruction.
ordinary...
ignorance
of
the
law
is...
is
no
defense,
and
there
are
all
sorts
of
statutes
that
use
the
word
willful,
which
simply
means
that
you
intended
to
do
the
act
that
you
did,
not
that
you
knew
it
violated
the
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
to
say
there's
no
intent
to
comply
isn't
the
same
thing
as
saying
that
you
knew
you
were
violating
the
act
when
you
acted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
can
you...
how
can
you
willfully
ignore
an
act's
requirements?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we're
concerned
here,
justice
breyer
and
i
guess...
what
is
going
to
happen
if
we
rule
in
your
favor?
that
will
probably
not
result
in
any
benefit
for
the
government
on
this
ground,
but
are
we
just
opening
a
can
of
worms
or
is...
by
ruling
in
your
favor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
campbell.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
campbell,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
campbell.
the
case
is
submitted.
