mr.
ronald
molteni
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
eighth
circuit
interprets
entity
to
include
political
subdivisions
of
the
states,
and
that
would
mean
that
congress
has...
it
would
have
the
effect
of
congress
giving
missouri's
political
subdivisions
authority
that
the...
the
very
state
that
created
them
has
withheld.
and
that
would
intrude
drastically
on
the
structure
of
state
government.
a
general
language
term
like
entity
is
too
broad
to
meet
the
gregory
test
because
it
doesn't
clearly
and
unmistakably
include
state
subdivisions.
if...
if
the
general
term
entity,
without
a
contextual
compass,
as
it
appears
in
253(a),
satisfies
the
clear
and
unmistakable
test,
then
clear
and
unmistakable
really
has
little
meaning.
but
that
standard
is
important
to
the
states
because
it
gives
the
states
some
notice
and
opportunity
to
react
to
proposed
legislation
that
may
intrude
on
state
sovereignty,
and
it
requires
congress
to
be
clear
in
the
wording
that
it
uses
and
to
demonstrate
cognizance
of
the
impact
of
legislation
on
state
sovereignty.
mr.
ronald
molteni
justice
scalia...
mr.
ronald
molteni
justice
scalia,
there
are
no
magic
words,
and
we're
not
asserting
that
there
are
magic
words
that
need
to
be
there.
there
has
to
be
some
terminology
within
the
statute
that...
that
demonstrates
that
congress
was
cognizant
it
intended
to
intrude
on
state
government.
there
are
other
instances...
and
i
think
southwestern
bell's
brief
does
a
nice
job
pointing
out
that
entity
is
used
600-and-some
times
in
various
statutes.
it's
used
multiple
times
even
in
the
telecommunications
act,
oftentimes
with
a
modifier,
sometimes
without,
and
oftentimes
with
a
definition,
and
sometimes
the
definition
is
one...
it
includes
just
a
business
context,
and
sometimes
the
definition
is
one
that
includes
government
and
public
and
state,
private,
political...
mr.
ronald
molteni
it's
a...
justice
stevens,
it's
a
significant
restriction
on
the
state's
ability
to...
to
impact
commerce.
mr.
ronald
molteni
but
this
court
has
held
in
the
gregory
v.
ashcroft
case
that
congress
has
to
use
more
than
the
general
language.
it
has
to
be
clear
and
unmistakable.
and,
justice
stevens,
in...
in
the...
the
leadwood
case
that...
that
mr.
feldman
brought
up,
your...
the
dissent
that...
that
you
wrote
affirms
some
of
the
principles
that...
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief
regarding
hunter
and...
and
the
city
of
trenton
case
that
the
states
control
the...
the
creations
that
they
have,
that
they've
made,
all
their
political
subdivisions,
and...
and
that
is...
is
something
that
this
court
has
always
honored.
mr.
ronald
molteni
that's
exactly
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
ronald
molteni
justice
breyer,
i
think
it
would
create
an
anomalous
situation
where
if
a
state's
political
subdivisions
had
been
providing
telecommunications
prior
to
1996,
they
would
be
treated
differently
under
the...
under
253(a).
mr.
ronald
molteni
but
i...
i
still
think,
justice
breyer,
that
what
that
does
is
it
make...
it
divides
the
states
into
two
categories
and
makes
the
federal
statute
treat
the
states
in
two
different
ways
so
that
if
a
state
had
granted
authority
prior
to
1996,
the...
they...
they
may
never...
that
state
is
never
allowed
to
change
its
mind
about...
mr.
ronald
molteni
about
the
scope
of
authority
that
it
grants
its
own
political
subdivisions.
mr.
ronald
molteni
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that
i
agree
with
you,
although
i
think
the
more
and
more
we
talk
about
what
states
authorize
and
don't
authorize
their
political
subdivisions
do...
to
do,
the
more
and
more
that
becomes
really
the...
a
state
issue
and...
and
really
what
i...
what
i
would
call
an
intramural
issue
that
would...
that
would
be
a
matter
litigated
between
the
states
and
their
political
subdivisions
at
the
state
court
level.
and
what...
what
i
really
think
this
case
is
about
is
an
application
of
253(a)
that,
because
of
the
general
language
that...
that
congress
used,
won't
be
presumed
and
cannot
meet
the
clear
and
unmistakable
standard
in
gregory
to...
to
allow
or
at
least
have
the
effect
of...
of
congress'
intruding
into
the
structure
of
state
government.
mr.
ronald
molteni
i
believe...
mr.
ronald
molteni
if...
if
the
state
were
addressing
that
in
terms...
through
the
private
sector,
i
don't
think
there
would
be...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
exactly
where
your
question
is
going,
justice
kennedy.
but
the...
could...
the
state
can't
create
barriers
to
entry
to
private
sector
competitors.
mr.
ronald
molteni
that's
clearly
preempted
by
the
commerce
clause
and...
and
it's
prevented
specifically
by
253(a).
and
i
think
what...
what
that
derives
from,
if
one
looks
at
the
purpose
of
the
federal
telecommunications
act
of
1996
and
you
look
at
the...
the
history
of
what
was
going
on,
huge
swatches
of
the
country
were
provided
service
by
regional
bell
operating
companies
and
they
were
granted
the
exclusive
franchise
in...
in
areas.
and
the
whole
purpose
of
the
'96
act
was
to
accelerate
private
sector
deployment
and...
and
to...
to
take
these...
these
swatches
of
territory
that
regional
bell
operating
companies
maintained
monopolies
on
and
encourage
private
sector
deployment
and
people
would
come
in
and
utilize
either
those...
the...
the
facilities
that...
that
were
provided...
that...
that
exist
that
the
regional
bell
operating
companies
had
or
unbundle
network
elements
or
to...
to
resell
and...
and
hopefully
even
the
encouragement
of...
of
building
their
own
facilities
base.
but
that's
all...
that
all
ends
up
being
a
red
herring
discussion
in
terms
of
the
clear
language
of
253(a)
because
253(a)
uses
those
general
terms.
now,
the
fcc's
reading
of
entity
won't
bar
states
from
entering
commercial
phone
business
through
their...
through
their
political
subdivisions
because
the
fcc's
reading
allows
that
states
who
want
to
go
into
the
phone
business...
they'll
be
able
to
do
that.
but
states
like
missouri
that
want
their
political
subdivisions
focused
on
core
missions
will
be
able
to
make
that
choice
if
this
court
allows
the
fcc's
reading.
mr.
ronald
molteni
how
many
states
allow
their
own...
mr.
ronald
molteni
justice
ginsburg,
i...
i
do
not
know
that.
i
have
not
surveyed
which
states
allow
their
political
subdivisions
to...
to
enter
the
commercial
phone
business
and...
and
which,
like
missouri,
have
made
that
choice
to
have...
made
the
choice
to
have
their...
their
political
subdivisions
focus
on
their
core
missions.
another
problem
that's
created
with
the
respondents'
reading
of...
of
entity
is
that
it
literally
means
the
state
cannot
regulate
itself,
and
that...
that
creates
an
anomaly
and...
and
it
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
linguistic
sense
or
a
lot
of
public
policy
sense.
the
clear
and
unmistakable
standard
requires
more
of
congress
than
this
use
of
general
language
and
where
there
is
doubt,
states
are
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
that
doubt.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
missouri
would
respectfully
request
that
the
court
reverse
the
eighth
circuit
and
preserve
the
ability
of
the
state
of
missouri
to
determine
the
functions
of
its
own
political
subdivisions.
