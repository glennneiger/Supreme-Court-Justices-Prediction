we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1238,
nixon
v.
missouri
municipal
league
and
missouri
municipal
league
against
southwestern
bell.
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
molteni,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
that
it's
one
thing
for
the
federal
government
to
supersede
state
regulation
substantively,
but
another
thing
to
say...
to
tell
the
state
not
only
do
we
do
that,
but
we're
going
to
change
the
relationship
you
have
with
your
local
subdivisions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
molteni.
mr.
strauss,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you...
when
you
say
the
statute
has
to
be
ambiguous,
the
gregory
rule
as
put
forth
in
the
opinion
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
clear
statement
covering
the
federal...
federal
aspect
of
the
thing.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
cuts
away
from
the
idea
it
has
to
be
ambiguous.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
raygor
had
any
entity
too
and
we
said
that
was
not
conclusive
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
also
the
fact
that
sovereign
immunity
had
never
extended...
a
state
eleventh
amendment
immunity
had
never...
had
never
been
extended
to
counties.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
why
should
we...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
we
interpret
a
statute
in
that
awkward
way,
that
the
fcc
has
to
make
this
kind
of
factual
inquiry
in
every
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
feldman,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
three
companion
cases,
nixon
versus
missouri
municipal
league
and
others
will
be
announced
by
justice
souter.
