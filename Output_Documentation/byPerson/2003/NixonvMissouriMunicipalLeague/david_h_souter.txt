justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
strauss,
may
i
go
back
and
ask
a
variant
on
justice
breyer's
question,
assuming
that
there
is
some
implicit
limitation
on...
on
the
scope
of
any
entity?
and
it
relates
to
what,
if
i
have
my
facts
straight,
is
the...
is
the
drafting
history
in
this
case,
and
i'd
like
you
to
tell
me
whether
i
have
got
the
facts
straight
because
i
didn't
look
them
up
myself.
i
just
got
this
out
of
the
briefs.
and
if
so,
what
you
think
the
significance
is.
as
i
understand
it,
at
least
the
senate
version
of
the
original
bill
had
a
provision
in
it
that
affirmative...
expressly
provided
that
any
existing
utility,
whatever
its
object
of
service,
could
go
into
the
telecommunications
business.
and
this,
as...
as
you
point
at
one
point
in
your
brief,
this
would
be...
this
would
be
good
for
your
argument
because
a
lot
of
those
utilities
are
municipal
utilities.
as
i
understand
it,
in
the...
in
the
conference
committee,
that
language
was,
in
fact,
removed
entirely,
and
subsequent
to
its
removal
in
the
conference
committee
report,
there
were
references
to
any
private
entity
being
able
to
go
into
the
telecommunications
business
but
not
the
old,
pre-conference
committee
references
to...
to
any...
any
public
as
well
as
private
entity.
that
suggests
to
me,
the...
the
combination
of
the
drafting
change
and
the
conference
committee
report,
that
the
implicit
scope
they
were
getting
at
was
an
implicit
scope
that
says
any
entity
is
a
reference
to
private,
not
public.
what...
are
my
facts
straight,
and
if
so,
what...
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you
say
the...
the
excision
was
a
redundancy
excision.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
the
answer
to
that
i
think
is
in...
in
part
a
response
to
something
in
your
brief.
you
mentioned
that
the
original
house
and
the
original
senate
reports
were
speaking,
among
others,
expressly
of...
of
public
entities.
as
i
understand
it...
and
again,
i
didn't
look
myself.
i
just
got
this
from...
from
one
of
the
briefs.
as
i
understand
it,
the
conference
committee
report...
after
this
excision,
which
is
arguably
just
a
redundancy
excision,
the
conference
committee
report
started
using
the
adjective
private
entities
rather
than
public
entities
as
being
subject
to
this
kind
of
universal
preemption.
doesn't
that
nix
the
theory
that
it
was
merely
a
redundancy
excision?
justice
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
we're
left
with,
it
seems
to
me,
is...
is
at
least...
maybe
let's
call
it
tension
between
the
conference
committee
report
and
the
preamble
language
which
was
then
inserted.
and
isn't
that
a
perfect
situation
to
provide...
to...
to
apply
a
gregory
kind
of
rule,
saying
when
we're
not
sure
what
they
meant,
we
want
them
to
spell
it
out
more
clearly
before
we
conclude
that
they,
in
effect,
are...
are
limiting
the...
the
power
of
a...
of
a
state
to
determine
what
its
municipalities
can
do?
isn't
this
a
good
situation
for
a
gregory
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
think
so
too.
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
maybe
what
i'm
saying
is
we...
we
ought
to...
those
of
us
who
would
look
into
the...
the
legislative
history,
as
i
would,
maybe
ought
to
take
advantage
of
a
slightly
broader
gregory
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
the
difference,
though...
and
i...
i
see
your
argument.
but
isn't
the
difference
that
in
that
case
we
didn't
have
anything
in
the
history
either
of
the
drafting
or
of
the
legislative
consideration
of
the
statute
that
suggested
that
there
really
was
an...
an
argument
each
way
as...
as
to
whether
they...
they
were...
they
were
intending
to...
to
cover
the...
the
prisoners.
they
simply
didn't
deal
with...
with
that
situation
at
all,
and
they
used
absolute
kind
of...
of
language.
here,
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
because
the
drafting
changed.
the
drafting
certainly
could
have
significance
for...
for
public
utilities.
there
is
a
tension
between
the...
the
conference
committee
report
and
the
preamble.
in
other
words,
we've...
we've
got
a...
a
question
sort
of
affirmatively
raised
by
the
history
of
the
drafting
and
enactment
of
the
statute,
whereas
there
was
simply
silence
in
the
yeskey
situation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i...
i
grant
you
that,
but
when...
when
the...
when
the
issue
relates
to
the
kind
of
state
sovereignty
issue
that...
that
gregory
addresses,
that's
a
good
reason
for
having
a
gregory
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
these
cases
come
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
in
1997,
the
general
assembly
of
missouri
enacted
a
statute
prohibiting
political
subdivisions
of
the
state
from
providing
telecommunications
services.
the
municipal
respondents
in
these
cases
petitioned
to
federal
communications
commission
for
an
order
declaring
the
state
statute
unlawful
and
preempted.
under
the
provisions
of
the
telecommunications
act
of
1996,
the
relevant
section
253
of
the
federal
statute
provides
that
no
state
or
local
statute
or
regulation
or
other
state
or
local
legal
requirement
may
prohibit
or
have
the
affect
of
prohibiting
the
ability
of
any
entity
to
provide
any
interstate
or
intrastate
telecommunication
service.
after
noticing
the
comment,
the
fcc
refused
to
declare
the
missouri
statute
preempted.
the
agency
concluded
that
the
term,
‘any
entity,’
in
section
253(a)
was
not
intended
to
include
political
subdivisions
of
the
state,
but
rather
appeared
to
prohibit
restrictions
on
market
entry
that
apply
to
independent
entities
subject
to
state
regulation.
in
so
concluding
the
fcc
relied
on
its
own
earlier
order
resolving
a
challenge
to
a
comparable
texas
law,
as
well
as
on
the
affirming
opinion
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
district
of
columbia
circuit.
the
municipal
respondents
here
appealed
to
the
eighth
circuit,
where
a
panel
unanimously
reversed
the
agency
disposition
with
the
explanation
that
the
generic
term
‘entity,’
especially
when
modified
by
any
manifest
its
sufficiently
clear
congressional
intentional
attention
to
governmental
entities,
to
get
pass
the
plain
statement
rule
of
gregory
and
ashcroft.
we
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
resulting
conflict
between
the
district
of
colombia
circuit
and
the
eighth
circuit.
in
an
opinion
filed
today
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
we
reverse.
the
result
in
this
litigation
is
controlled
neither
by
public
policy
considerations,
nor
by
any
laser
like
focus
on
section
253’s
reference
to
any
entity.
as
for
policy,
the
municipalities
have
at
the
least
a
respectable
position,
that
state
law
is
fencing
governmental
entities
out
of
the
telecommunications
business
disserved
the
public
interest,
but
it
does
not
follow
that
preempting
state
or
local
barriers
to
governmental
entry
into
the
market,
would
be
an
effective
way
to
draw
municipalities
into
the
business.
in
any
event
the
issue
here
does
not
turn
on
the
merits
of
municipal
telecommunication
services.
concerning
the
text,
the
eighth
circuit
trained
its
analysis
on
the
words,
"any
entity,"
left
undefined
by
the
statute,
but
there
is
no
common
practice
of
omitting
modifiers
like
public
and
private
when
both
are
meant
to
be
covered.
nor
is
coverage
of
public
entities
reliably
signaled
by
speaking
of
any
entity.
the
word
‘any’
can
and
does
mean
different
things
depending
upon
the
setting.
to
get
it
congress's
understanding,
it
helps
if
we
ask,
how
congress
could
have
envisioned
the
preemption
clause,
actually
working
if
the
fcc
applied
it
at
the
municipal
respondents'
urging,
we
think
that
the
strange
and
indeterminate
results
of
using
federal
preemption
in
an
effort
to
free
public
entities
from
the
state
and
local
limitations
is
the
key
to
understanding
that
congress
used
"any
entity"
in
a
limited
sense
when
it
cast
the
preemption
and
that
in
the
statute.
the
municipal
respondents'
position
hold
sufficient
promise
of
futility
and
uncertainty
to
keep
us
from
accepting
it,
and
a
complementary
principle
would
bring
us
to
the
same
conclusion.
our
preemption
to
the
state
law
regulating
the
conduct
of
its
political
subdivisions,
retrench
on
the
states'
arrangements
for
conducting
their
own
governance.
the
want
of
any
unmistakably
clear
congressional
statement
that
such
an
effect
was
actually
intended,
would
be
fatal
to
the
respondents’
reading
under
the
case
of
gregory
and
ashcroft.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment
in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined
and
justice
stevens
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.
