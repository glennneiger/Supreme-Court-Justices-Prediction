mr.
james
a.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
47
u.s.c.,
section
253(a)
which
preempts
state
laws
that
prohibit
or
have
the
effect
of
prohibiting
the
ability
of
any
entity
to
provide
telecommunications
services.
now,
it's
common
ground
that
section
253(a)
preempts
state
laws
that
keep
private
firms
from
the
telecommunications
market.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
law
also
reaches
into
the
structure
of
state
government
and
invalidating
even
a
state
statute
that
declines
to
grant
the
state's
political
subdivisions
the
authority
to
provide
telecommunications.
in
gregory
against
ashcroft,
this
court
held
that
federal
statutes
should
not
be
construed
to
intrude
on
core
areas
of
state
sovereignty
unless
congress
has
made
its
intent
to
do
so
clear.
now,
in
our
tradition,
political
subdivisions
are
creatures
of
the
state
and
they
have
the
authority
and
only
the
authority
that
the
state
has
granted
them.
under
respondents'
interpretation,
section
253(a)
would
be
a
sharp
and
unprecedented
break
with
that
tradition
because
it
would
be
a
grant
of
power
by
the
federal
government
to
political
subdivisions
of
powers
that
the
state,
which
was
hitherto
the
sole
source
of
their
authority...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
don't...
i'm
not
even
sure
whether
that's
true.
that
actually
goes
into
another
difficulty
in
construing
the
statute
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did.
some
states
create
their
political
subdivisions
or
some
political
subdivisions
and
say
you
have
only
the
authority
that
we
have
given
you,
and
it's
not...
other
states
create
political
subdivisions
and
say
you
have
any
authority
you
want
except...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
think...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
perhaps
it's
a
question
of
semantics,
but...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but...
but
the...
but
the...
the
issue
here
is
that
in
missouri
political
subdivisions
do
not
have
the
authority
to
provide
telecommunications
services.
under
the
court
of
appeals'
ruling,
the
statute
that...
that
reaches
that
result
is
preempted,
and
therefore
they
do
have
that
authority.
in
any
event,
that
would
be
a
sharp
break
with
the
tradition
that
because
it
would
be
congress
specifying
what
the
authority
of
a
political
subdivision
is
even
when
a
state
has
chosen
not
to
give
it
that
authority.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
because
under
the
gregory
rule,
if
you...
if
the
court
were
to
construe
the
statute
so
that
it
did
include
political
subdivisions,
it
would
be
a
intrusion
into
state
sovereignty.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
other...
i
can't
imagine
cases...
and
i'm
not
aware
that
any
have
come
up
in
the
cases
that
have
addressed
the...
the
question
presented
here...
where
there
are
some
other
restriction
that
a
state
has
passed
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
political
subdivisions.
and
the
question
might
arise
whether
a
political
subdivision
could
challenge
that...
that
provision
of
state
law
as
well
as
a
private
party.
and...
but,
however,
since
the
court
is
in
the
business
here
of
construing
the
statute
and
the
question
is
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
word
any
entity,
i
think
under
the
gregory
rule,
that...
that
term
has
to
exclude
political
subdivisions.
and
if
it
excludes
it
here,
i
think
it...
there's
no...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it's
our
understanding...
it's
our
understanding
that
the
rule
would
apply
here.
i
guess
the
rule
applies
for
the
reasons
i've
already
given,
which
is
this
is
an
intrusion
on
state
sovereignty.
if
that
were
not
the
case,
the
question
would
be
whether
a
general
term
like
the
term,
any
entity,
is
whether
that
would
just
naturally
be
construed
to
extend
so
far
or
whether
it
wouldn't.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
and
i
would
say
that
it
raises
the
question
that
i
was...
the...
the
problem
that
i
was
referring
to
before
in
responding
to
justice
stevens,
which
is
state...
the
application
of
253(a)
would
depend
on
the
form
in
which
a
state
chooses
to
give
or
not
give
its
power
to
its
political
subdivisions.
if
it
was
a
state...
a
home
rule
state
where
the
cities
have
all
the
powers
except
what's
expressly
denied
them,
then
a
state
that
tried
to
pull
back
the
power
to
provide
telecommunications...
that
would
be
preempted.
in
another
state...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
so
sometimes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would
at
least
be
a
difficult
question
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
there
is
still
something
that
prohibits
or
has
the
effect
of
prohibiting
rather
than
something
which
just
never
granted
the
authority
before.
you
could
consider
a
political
subdivision
of
a
state
that's
a
special
purpose
water
district
or
fire
prevention
district
that
just
doesn't
have
the
authority,
was
never
intended
to
have
the
authority,
and
nothing
in
state
law
suggests
that
it
should
have
the
authority
to
provide
telecommunications.
it
would
be
hard
to
find
something
that
should
be
preempted
in
that
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
don't...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
i
don't
think
it...
because
i...
i
think
that
there
is...
it's
very
difficult
to
imagine
that
congress
intended
that
the...
the
scope
of
this
statute
should
turn
on
the
exact
historical
steps...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
they
once
had
or...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
but
i
guess
what
i
was
responding
to
was
it's
not...
the...
the
definition
of
what
a
political
subdivision
is
fit,
willing,
and
able
to
do
is
something
that...
it
is
a
creature
of
state
law.
it's
defined
by
state
law,
by
the
state
laws
that
have...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
there's
actually
very
few...
before
1996,
i
think
there
were
very
few...
and
i'm
not
aware
of
examples.
there
may
be
a
few
in
the
amicus
briefs.
there
are
very,
very
few
entities
in
this
country
of
these
political
subdivisions
that
offered
telecommunications
services.
this
is
a
question
that
has
only
arisen...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
that...
i
think
part
of
my
argument
is
the
difficulty
of
drawing
that
distinction,
but
the
most
important
part
of
it
is
that
this
is
an
intrusion
into
a
state's
understanding
of
its
government
and
what
it
wants
to
do
with
its
authority.
and
where
a
state...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
there
would
be
interpretive
problems
that
would
arise
in
the
statute
if
it
had
said...
specified
any
public...
any
governmental
entity
or
something
like
that
that
really
would
have
clearly
referred
to
states
and
political
subdivisions.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
would
have
been...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it's
likely
that
that
would
do.
the
problem
here
is
that
any
entity
is
just
the
kind
of
general
term
without
the...
the
reference
to
public
or
private
or
without
specific
references
to
state
governments
and
political
subdivisions.
it's
just
the
kind
of
general
term
that
this
court
referred
to
in
raygor
and
said
that
where
there's
a
clear
statement
rule,
that
kind
of
general
term
is
not
sufficient
to
overcome
it.
and
here,
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
suggests
that
congress
thought
about,
considered,
and
intended
to
put
into
question
the
issue
of
state
sovereignty
that
would
be...
that...
the
intrusion
on
state
sovereignty
that
would
be
raised
by
construing
253(a)
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
did.
beyond
the
statute
itself,
in
the
legislative
history
there's...
there
is
a...
the
committee
report
repeatedly
refers
to
the
private
sector
deployment
of
advanced
telecommunications
as
what
the
bill
is
designed
to
achieve.
not
only
that,
the
floor
debates...
they're
cited
in,
i
think,
southwestern
bell's
reply
brief...
show
also
people
consistently
referring
to
the
private
sector
development
of
advanced
telecommunications.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
actually
is
broader
than
that.
there
is
another
provision
which
says...
i
don't
remember
the
number...
which
says
that
there
can't
be
exclusive
franchises.
this
is
intended
to
get
at
laws
not
only
that
would
by
terms
give
an
exclusive
franchise
or
keep
a
particular
company
out
of
the
telecommunications
business,
but
also
that
would
have
the
effect
of
doing
that
by
imposing
high
taxes
on
one
category
of...
of
participants
rather
than
on
another
category.
there...
there's
the...
in
fact,
in
the
texas
case
that
came
before
this,
the
federal
communications
commission
found
a
couple
of
provisions
of
texas
law
preempted
because
they
did
just
that.
and
the
statute
was
designed...
it
is
an
anti-monopoly
law,
but
it
is
a
little
bit
broader
than
just
granting
exclusive
franchises.
it's
also
favoring
one...
at
one...
one
company
or
one
class
of
company
or
the
incumbent
telephone
company
over
other
new
entrants
into
the
field.
respondents
cite
the...
lead-deadwood
case
as
the
closest
that
they
can
come
to
this,
and
i'd
just
like
to
point
out
that
that
case
has
a
dramatically
different
question
than
the
one
here.
in
that
case,
there
was
no
question
of
the
federal
government
giving
authority
to
local...
to
political
subdivisions
that
the
state
itself
had
not...
had
not
given.
that
case
would
be
much
closer
to
this
case
if,
for
example,
the
state
there
had
said
we
don't
want
our
political
subdivisions
to
be
providing
education
because
we
do
that
at
the
state
level,
and
then
the
political
subdivision
had
taken
the
federal
money
that
was
at
issue
there
and
said
we
want
to
open
up
a
local
university
or
something.
at
least
that
would
have
presented
the
question
that's
presented
here
of
an
intrusion
of
that
sort
on
state
sovereignty,
but
that
wasn't
before
the
court
there
and
therefore
the
court
didn't
apply
a
clear
statement
rule.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
if
you
mean
by
public
utilities
companies
that
are
in
the
business...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
they
certainly
can.
privately
owned
companies
that
are
in
the
utility
business...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
the
federal
communications
commission's
position
is
if,
under
state
law,
it's
treated
as
a
private
entity,
the
fact
that
stock,
some
or
even
all
of
the
stock,
is
owned
by
the
political
subdivision
wouldn't
be...
it
would
still
be
an
entity.
it
would
be...
if
it's
treated
under
state
law
as
a
private
company.
in
this
case,
the
fcc
looked
at
missouri
law
and
determined,
i
think,
correctly...
it
hasn't
been
challenged
here...
that
this
is
simply
a
law
that
prevents
political
subdivisions
as
political
subdivisions
from
providing
telecommunications
services,
and
therefore,
since
it's
really
operating
on
the
political
subdivision
itself
and
not
on
some
other
corporation,
it's
not
preempted.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i'd
like
to
contrast
this
case
with
the
yeskey
case,
which
came
up
during
mr.
strauss'
argument.
in
the
yeskey
case,
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
referred
to
public
entities,
i
think,
and
then
it
defined
them
as
including
any
department
of
the
state.
once...
that
meant
that
in
that
act,
congress
had
specifically
considered
that
it
was
going
to
intrude
deeply,
as
justice
scalia
said,
in
state
government,
and
it
had
made
the
decisions
of
how
to
do
it
and
the
whole...
in
fact,
title
ii
of
the
act
is
designed
to...
to
tailor
that,
exactly
how
congress
wanted
to.
in
this
statute,
there's
no
indication
that
congress
crossed
that
initial
dividing
line
and
wanted...
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
congress
did
contemplate
giving
some
leeway
to
the
states
when
it
was
competitively
neutral,
but
the
question
of
what
competitive
neutrality
means
in
this
context
is
not
an
easy
one.
and...
and
i'd
like
to
add
that
if
congress
had
had
to
take
the...
do
what
it
did
in
yeskey
and...
and
decide
yes,
we
do
want
this
to
apply
to
the
states,
it
might
have
occurred
to
congress
that
they
were
going
to
have
to
think
about
exactly
what
that
means,
applying
a
statute
like
this
to
state
governments
that
grant
their
political
subdivisions
different
kinds
of
powers
in
different
kinds
of
ways.
congress
didn't...
never
made
that
first
choice
that
it
consciously
wanted
to
intrude
on
state...
state
sovereignty
the
way
the
eighth
circuit
held,
and
therefore
it
never
answered
those
other
questions.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
well,
i
mean,
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case,
but
the
fcc's
rationale
is
that
insofar
as
under
state
law
you
have
a
thing
that
is
treated
just
like
a
private
corporation,
it's...
it's
an
entity.
that's
exactly
who
congress
was
clearly
and
directly
and
most
importantly
targeting
this
law
at.
it's...
it's
where
the...
if
it's
a
municipally
owned
utility
that
is
really
treated
like
the
political
subdivision
of
the
state,
as
they
are
in
missouri,
then
that
would
be
different
because
that
would
raise
these
other
questions,
and
congress
had
never
made
the
decision
that
it
wants
to
intrude
on...
really
in
an
unprecedented
way,
on
the
authority
of
the
political
subdivisions.
states
decide
to
give...
