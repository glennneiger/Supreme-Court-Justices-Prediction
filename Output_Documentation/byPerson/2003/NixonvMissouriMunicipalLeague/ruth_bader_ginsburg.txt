if
the...
if
the
statute
were
clear,
if
it
said
public...
it
said
any
entity,
public
or
private...
but
you're...
you're
making
an
argument
now
that
seems
to
say
no
matter
how
clear
this
was,
there
would
still
be
a
vulnerability.
justice
ginsburg
well,
wouldn't...
wouldn't
any...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
entity,
public
or
private,
wouldn't
that
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
united
states'
position
about
utilities,
public
utilities,
electric
companies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
enter
this
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
it...
suppose
it's
mixed
ownership,
city
and
private.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
know
how
many
states
allow
their
municipalities
to
enter
this
business?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
in
other
words,
you're
arguing
for
a
position
it's
up
to
the
state.
they
can
let
the
municipalities
enter
or
not
if
they
choose.
so
in...
in
fact,
what
has
happened
across
the
country?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
rationale
for
saying
a
municipal
utility,
a
wholly
owned
electric
company,
wholly
owned
by
the
city,
that's
okay?
that
doesn't
matter...
the
state
can't
stop
that
from
going
into
the
telecommunications,
but
it
can
stop
the
municipal
corporation.
