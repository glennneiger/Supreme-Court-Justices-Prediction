justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
didn't
give
that
very
broad
meaning
to
any
entity,
but
you
included
state
entities
that
had
been
in
the
business
and
were
otherwise
authorized
by
state
law
to
go
into
this
business
and
then
the
state
changes
its
law
and
without
having
a
section
(b)
requirement,
because
you
have
loads
of
power
under
section
(b),
so
we
assume
the
entity
meets
section
(b)'s
test,
but
it
passes
another
law
which
says,
by
the
way,
the
municipality
can't
go
into
it.
and
previously
they
had.
so...
so
we're
not...
we're...
we're
talking
about
only
entities
that
have
proved
themselves
fit,
willing,
and
able
to
offer
the...
the...
to
offer
the
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
why...
why
would
that
not
be
included?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
we
want...
we
want...
we
have
implicitly
there
and
it
would
be
necessary
in
the
state
case
but
not
in
the
private
entity
case
an
entity
that
is
fit,
willing,
and
able.
and...
and
an
entity
that
is
fit,
willing,
and
able
can
include
a
municipality.
so
what
this
statute
is
after
is
the
state
passing
a
new
law
changing
the
status
of
an
entity
that
was
previously
fit,
willing,
and
able.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that...
that's
correct,
but
it's
defined
by
state
regulatory
law
in
respect
to
those
entities
at
least
that
have
previously
offered
the
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
in
other
words,
but
your
argument
here
is
coming
down
to
the
difficulty
of
trying
to
draw
the
distinction
i'm
suggesting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
they...
they
did...
is
it
totally
ashcroft
you're
relying
on?
gregory
v.
ashcroft?
the...
suppose
you
looked
at
the
statute
as
saying
it
doesn't
prohibit
states
from
enacting
all
kinds
of
laws
that
have
the
effect
of
prohibiting
people
to
enter
the
business.
tax
laws,
for
example,
might
leave
them
without
money
to
do
it.
it's
only
talking
about
specific
laws
aimed
at
saying
you
can't
enter.
and
if
it's
aimed
at
specific
laws
saying
you
can't
enter
this
business,
then
couldn't
you
say
where
a
state's
entity
otherwise
would
have
the
authority
to
enter,
then
the
state
cannot
pass
a
law
that
says
in
those
circumstances
you
cannot
enter
telecommunications
such
as
municipality
as
well
as
private
company?
now,
what's
wrong
with
that
interpretation?
what
i'm
doing
is
i'm
trying
to
deal
with
what
i
thought
of
myself
and
they
confirm
is
the
major
objection
that
this
can't
be
administered
once
we
start
down
the
path
i'm
just
starting
down.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
it
would
be...
the
question
would
be
whether
they
had
the
authority
to
do
it.
if
they
had
the
authority
to
do
it,
then
the
state...
what
it
could
not
do
is
it
could
not
pass
a
law
which
aims
at
primarily...
aims
at
primarily
their
authority
to
enter
telecommunications.
they
could
do
all
kinds
of
other
things
including
removing
authority
as
long
as
it
were
general,
and
then
there
would
be
middle
cases
where
the
authority,
you
see,
is...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
a
one-way
ratchet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it
doesn't
mean
any
fish,
for
example.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
things
it
doesn't
mean.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if
for
purposes
of...
will
you
assume
with
me...
and
i
may
be
the
only
one
who
thinks
this.
but
i
think
when
you
use
words
like
any
entity
or
the
word
any,
that
there's
an
implicit
scope,
and
since
i
think
there's
an
implicit
scope,
i'm
trying
to
define
that
scope.
so
i
don't
want
to...
i
mean,
it's
not
going
to
help
me
for
you
to
say,
well,
it's
clear
because
i
don't
think
it's
clear.
but
at
that
point,
i
now
want
to...
to
find
out
whether...
explore
what
you
said
that,
well,
if
we
did
apply
this
to
the
states
and
their
municipalities,
all
we
would
really
be
doing
is
targeting
laws.
now,
i
did
my
best
to
pose
some
questions
along
those
lines,
but
i
was
met
with
the
answer
which
strikes
me
as
a
pretty
good
answer.
there's
just
no
way
to
do
what
you're
suggesting.
it's
going
to
be
a
nightmare.
justice
scalia
suggested
one
reason
it
was
a
nightmare.
and
i'd
add
that
in
the
case
of
private
companies,
this
statute
is
designed
to
give
the
private
company
the
right
to
enter
or
the
right
to
quit.
once
you
apply
it
to
a
municipal
entity,
it
has
the
right
to
enter,
but
it
could
never
quit.
now,
that
would
be
bizarre.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
given
the...
the
sovereign
immunity...
you
know,
the
sovereign...
all...
all
the
things
we've
been
talking
about
in
general,
given
the
difficulty
of
drawing
a
line,
which
seems
virtually
impossible
or
very
hard,
and
given
the
one-way
ratchet
i
just
described,
it
can't
be
that
congress
intended
to
include
municipal
entities
within
the
scope
of
the
word,
any
entity.
what...
what
is
your...
that's...
i'm
trying
to
get
to
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
see
the
answer
to
that
part,
which
is
you're
saying
they
have
to
do
it
anyway,
and
i
understand
that.
whether...
i'm
not
sure
i
agree,
but
i
understand
it.
what
about
the
part
that
it's
a
one-way
ratchet?
and
there
i
think
that
local
governments
unlike
local
private
businesses
act
through
regulation,
at
least
normally.
and
so
the
statute
talks
about
a
requirement,
a
local
requirement
or
a
local
regulation,
and
therefore,
a
state,
state
a,
that
does
not
permit
its
municipalities
to
go
into
the
business,
then
passes
a
statute
that
does
permit
it,
then
the
local
council
passes
a
regulation
that
says
we'll
do
it,
which
is
now
a
requirement,
and
when
either
tries
to
repeal
either,
they
run
right
straight
into
your...
to
this
statute
forbidding
it
as
you
interpret
it.
and
now,
that's
why
i
say
it's
a
one-way
ratchet
in
respect
to
municipalities,
but
not
a
one-way
ratchet
in
respect
to
private
businesses.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
state
could
not
repeal
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
does...
what
does...
is
there
any
argument
for
putting...
leaving
this
up
to
the
commission?
that
is,
can
it
be
done?
because
i
can
see
a
complex
interpretation
that
may
be
workable
that
you're
suggesting
and
may
be
helpful
competitively,
frankly.
and
i
also
can
see
some
good
arguments
against,
assuming
congress
intended
that
complex
interpretation.
but
under
those
circumstances,
maybe
congress
purposely
leaves
it
somewhat
ambiguous
permitting
the
commission
to
go
one
way
or
the
other,
and
although
you've
lost
it
in
the
commission
so
far,
maybe
in
the
future,
the
commission
would
say,
well,
we
think
we
want
to
chevronize
this,
in
other
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
think
about
that?
