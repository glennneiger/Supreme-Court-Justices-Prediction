paul
stevens
i
don't
think
that's
right.
it
wouldn't
be
a
grant
of
power.
it
would
be...
it
would
preserve
power
granted
by
the
state
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only...
the
only
thing
i
question
is
your
statement
that
the
statute
itself
is
a
grant
of
power
to
a
local
entity.
it
doesn't
grant
any
power
to
anybody.
the
statute
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
preserves
power
from
being
preempted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
isn't
it
also
the
case...
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
this
one
more
sort
of
general
question?
as
i
understand
your
theory,
you
read
the
statute
as
an
anti-monopoly
statute.
no
state
shall
grant
any
exclusive
privilege.
isn't
that...
you
say
that's
really
what
it
does.
and
my
question
is
if
that
were
the
purpose,
why
wouldn't
they
write
it
that
way
that
no
state
shall
grant
a
monopoly
or
grant
exclusive
privilege?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
perfectly
clear
that
this
statute
does
intrude
substantially
on
the...
on
the
state's
ability
to
regulate.
just
even
if
it
just
does
what
you
say,
it's
a
significant
impairment
of
the
state's
ability
to
run
its
own
affairs.
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
regulate
private
companies.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
you
also
say
that
the
legislative
history
makes
it
pretty
clear
that
there's
a
distinction
in
meaning
between
the
term
private
entity
on
the
one
hand
and
the
term
entity
on
the
other
hand,
and
the
statute
used
the
term
entity?
