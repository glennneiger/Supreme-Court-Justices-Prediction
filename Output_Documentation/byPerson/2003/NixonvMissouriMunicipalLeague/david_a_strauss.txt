mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
in
this
case
is
straightforward
and
i
can
state
it
very
simply.
gregory
against
ashcroft
applies
in
circumstances
where
the
statutory
language
is
ambiguous.
the
court
has
said
that
three
times,
including
in
gregory
itself.
and
the
language
of
253(a),
any
entity,
is
not
ambiguous.
it's
not...
it's
not
as
if
congress
had
said,
for
example,
any
corporation,
which
might
leave
some
doubt
whether
congress
meant
only
private
corporations
and
not
municipal
corporations.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i...
i
wouldn't...
i
wouldn't...
i
guess
it
doesn't
mean
any
fish,
justice
breyer,
but
of
the...
i
think
it
has
a
very
broad
meaning.
i
think
it
means
any
entity
and...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
what
the
court...
the
court
said
in
gregory
that
the
statute
has
to
be
ambiguous
and
it
reiterated
that
in
salinas
and
more
recently
in
yeskey.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
unambiguous
language
in
gregory
was
employee.
the
ambiguous
language
was
at
the
policymaking
level.
in
gregory
itself...
it's
a...
it's
an
important
point,
justice
scalia.
in
gregory
itself,
the
court
thought
it
was
unambiguous
that
employee,
state
employee,
included
state
judges.
now,
it
seems
to
me
linguistically
to
say
that
state
employee
includes
state
judges
is
more
of
a
stretch
than
saying
any
entity
includes
local
governments,
but
that's
what...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
atascadero,
justice
scalia,
i
think
the
court
has
applied
a
different,
stronger,
much
stronger,
form
of
a
clear
statement
rule
in
the
state
sovereign
immunity
cases
where
it
has
required
specificity
in
the
court's
words.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
the...
the
best
illustration
of
that
is
the
contrast
between
the
court's
decision
in
raygor
and
the
court's
decision
in
jinks
which
have
the
advantage
of
focusing
on
exactly
the
same
statutory
language,
any
claim
asserted
in
a
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute.
in
raygor,
the
issue
was
whether
that
language
overrode
state
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
court
said
no.
in
jinks,
the
question
was
whether
that
language
overrode
a
state's
decision
to
immunize
its
subdivisions,
and
the
court
said,
yes,
it
did.
the
same
language.
jinks
is
the
case
like
this.
in
fact,
jinks
is
more
of
an
intrusion
because
the
congress
was
taking
away
a
power
that
the
state
wanted
to
confer
and
the
locality
wanted
to
have,
and
the
court
just
very
unanimously
and
with
no
difficulty
said
congress
can
do
that
with
the
language,
any
claim
asserted.
raygor
was
a
state
sovereign
immunity
question.
the
court
analyzed
it
differently.
and
i
think
that
makes
the
point
that
the
kind
of
rigor
the
court
expected
in
cases
like
atascadero
does
not
apply
in
gregory
cases.
in
gregory
cases,
if
it's
unambiguous,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
i
think
it
covers
the
state
itself.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
that
statute
is
not
void,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
statute...
analytically
that
situation
is
exactly
the
same
as
if
a
board
of
directors
of
a
private
corporation
decided
not
to
go
into
the
telecommunications
business
and
the
ceo
defied
it.
and
the
solution
is
the
state
can
say
under
our
neutral
principles
of
corporate
governance,
the
ceo
can't
do
that
not
because
the
corporation
is
not
an
entity.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
they
absolutely
do
if
they
are
truly
neutral
principles.
if
it's
a
provision
of
state
law
that
says,
for
example,
subdivisions
may
not
engage
in
any
commercial
activity
and
there's
no
argument
that
that's
just
a
subterfuge
to
keep
them
out
of
telecommunications,
it's
a
truly
neutral
provision,
states
can
absolutely
enforce
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the...
what's...
what's
operating
there
is
the
general
rule
that
governors
have
to
do
what
the
state
legislature
tells
them
to
do.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
when
this...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
because
in
the...
in
the
case
like
this
one,
what
the
state
has
done
is
to
enact
a
specific,
targeted
rule
not
competitively
neutral...
that
issue
is,
strictly
speaking,
not
before
the
court
yet...
a
targeted
rule
that
keeps
an
entity
out
of
the
telecommunications
business.
and
a
municipality
is
an
entity
in
the
same
way
that
a
private
firm
is
an
entity.
congress'
language
was
any
entity.
that
language
is
simply
not...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
raygor
said
any
claim.
that's
right.
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
raygor
was
a
case
decided
in
the
shadow
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
the
court
said
a
constitutional
doubt
was
created
by
principles
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
as
i...
as
i
said
to
justice
scalia,
jinks
interpreted
exactly
the
same
language,
any
claim,
to
be
sufficient
to
allow
congress
to
deprive
local
governments
of
an
immunity
that
states
wanted
to
grant
them.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
of
course
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
in
fact,
that
is
the
reason
i
want
to
take
exception
with
the
picture
painted
by
petitioners
that
what...
our
position
would
here
would
lead
to
some
dramatic,
unprecedented
intrusion
on
state
authority.
it's
actually
quite
familiar
for
federal
law
to
interfere,
quote/
unquote,
with
the
relations
between
state
and
local
governments.
section
1983
imposes
liability
on
local
governments.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
understand
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
special
significance
for
purposes
of
state
sovereign
immunity.
i've
never
known
the
court
to
say
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
has
special
significance
for
purposes
of
gregory
against
ashcroft.
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that...
that
is
a...
a...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
i
don't
agree
that
there's
a
one-way
ratchet
at
all,
justice
breyer.
i
think
the...
the
purpose
of
253(a)
is
to
eliminate
barriers
to
entry.
it's
not
to
force
anyone,
private
or
governmental,
to
go
into
the
telecommunications
business
or
stay
in
the
telecommunications
business.
and
if
a...
if
a
local
government
unit
decides
of
its
own
accord
to
enter
and
then
decides
of
its
own
accord
to
leave,
it
is
not
prohibited
anything.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
state
cannot
tell
it
not
to
enter
by
a
targeted,
non-competitively
neutral
provision.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it...
the
reason
why
it's
targeted...
targeted
is
what
i'm
using
to
embrace
the
notion
stated
in
253(b)
which
preserves
an
enormous
realm
of
regulatory
authority
to
the
states.
states
may
enact
competitively
neutral
regulations
that
satisfy
certain
other
criteria.
and
that's
an
important
part
of
this
picture
because
if
you
had
253(a)
in
isolation,
that
would...
that
would
certainly
be
draconian.
that
would
certainly
be
a...
a
remarkable...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think
that
would
be...
if
it...
if
it
specified
certain
commercial
activities
but
not
others,
i
think
that
would
be
a
difficult
question.
the
question
would
be
is
that
a
gerrymander...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
question...
the
question
would
be
a
253(b)
question
for
the
ftc
in
the
first...
fcc
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
it...
if
it
were
a
gerrymander
designed
to
keep...
really
just
designed
to
keep
entities
out
of
telecommunications,
it
would
be
unacceptable.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's...
that...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
this...
i
agree...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
this
is
the
question
that
would
have
to
come
up
when
the
fcc
applied
253(b)
to
a
public
or
a
private
entity...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
public
or
private.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
the
fcc
is
in
that
business
with
respect
to
private
entities
anyway.
a
state...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the
inquiry...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
inquiry...
it's
253(b).
it
says
states
may
enact
measures
that
are
competitively
neutral
and
necessary
to
promote
certain
public
objectives.
that's
a
savings
clause.
it's
not...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that
is
the
business...
that
is
unquestionably
the
business
congress
put
the
fcc
in
with
respect
to
private
entities.
there
is
no
disagreement
about
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
reason
it's
not
a
one-way
ratchet,
justice
breyer,
i
think
turns
on
the
word
prohibit.
this
isn't...
the
statute
253(a)
says
state
and
local
regulations
that
prohibit
the
entry.
if...
if
i
decide
not
to
go
skiing,
i've
not
prohibited
myself
from
going
skiing.
i've
simply
made
a
decision
not
to
do
something.
if
a
local
government
decides
not
to
enter
the
telecommunications
business,
it
hasn't
prohibited
itself.
it
simply
made
a
decision.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
state
could
not
repeal
the
statute
unless
it
were
part
of
a
competitively
neutral
reorganization
of
local
government
or
something
like
that.
then
it
could
repeal
it,
but
it
couldn't
enter
a
targeted
repeal
of
it
without
running
afoul...
it
seems
to
me
without
running
afoul...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
it
applies...
i
think
for
these
purposes,
municipal
corporations
and
private
corporations
are
simply
on
a
par
as,
of
course,
they
were
for
large
parts
of
our
history.
that's
why
municipalities
don't
have
many
immunities.
and
congress,
for
these
purposes,
simply
saw
municipal
corporations
as
another
source...
implicitly
saw...
and
the
words,
any
entity,
implicit
in
that
sense,
in
the...
in
the
ordinary
meaning
of
those
words...
saw
them
as
another
source
of
competition.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the...
the
restraint
is
the
competitively
neutral
language
which
will
ordinarily
allow
municipalities
to
say...
the
states
to
say,
look,
here's
what
you
can
do
and
here's
what
you
can't
do...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
provided
they
aren't
acting
in
a
way
that
is
competitively
non-neutral
with
respect
to
telecommunications.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no.
the
state
could
repeal
the
authority
if
it
does
it,
again,
in
a
competitively
neutral
way.
if
a
state
decided,
for
example,
to
abolish
all
units
of
local
government
or
if
a
state
decides
to
say,
okay,
we
are
assigning
special
functions
to
municipal
governments.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
the
municipality
can
decide
for
itself
because
then
it's
not
prohibiting
anyone
from
doing
anything.
it's
simply
making
a
decision.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
two
points,
justice
souter.
first,
i
think
it
is
common
ground
that
congress
did
envision
utilities
as
among
the
any
entities.
and
the...
the
likely
reason
congress
didn't
spell
that
out
was
that
it
was
already
included
in
the
notion
any
entity,
and
congress
didn't
want
to
begin
spelling
out
specifics
and
run...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
that's
right.
and
i
think
there
is
no
dispute
that
not
only
that
utilities
are
among
entities,
but
that
congress
really
saw
utilities
as
a
primary
source
of...
of
competition.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
conference
committee
report,
i
believe,
justice
souter,
used
the
word
private
to
describe...
in
describing
the
sort
of
competition
it
believed
would
be
brought
about.
that
passage
from
the
conference
committee
report
was
then
incorporated
almost
verbatim
in
the
preamble
to
the
statute,
but
the
word
private
was
left
out
when
it
was
transferred
to
the
statute
so
that
the
word
private
that
does
occur
prominently
in
the
conference
committee
report...
i
agree
with
that...
dropped
out
of
the
statute,
which
simply
talks
about
encouraging
competition.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
the
ambiguity
to
which
gregory
refers...
i
mean,
i
don't
think.
i
mean,
i
think
it
is
clear
the
ambiguities
to
which
gregory
refers
is
ambiguity
in
the
statutory
language.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
and...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the...
the
case
i
think
that
would
stand
in
the
way
more
than
any
other
perhaps...
well,
many
would
i
think,
but
the
clearest
example
i
can
think
of
is
yeskey
where
the...
the
question
in
yeskey
whether
the
ada,
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
applied
to
inmates
of
state
prisons.
the
court
assumed
that
prisons
were
special
and
that
the
gregory
rule
applied
to
legislation
that
assertedly
reached
prisons.
the
court
also
assumed
that
congress
never
specifically
contemplated
that
prison
inmates
would
be
covered,
and
it
said,
nonetheless,
unanimously
that
if
the
language...
the
language
is
something
like
state
instrumentalities...
if
the
language
included
prisons,
gregory
was
satisfied.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
souter,
i
guess
the
difficulty
i'd
have
with
that
approach
in
general
would
be
it
has
to
be
common
for
there
to
be
this
sort
of
uncertainty
in
legislative
history
with
feints
in
a
certain
direction
and
withdrawals
for
reasons
that
are
difficult
to...
to
fathom.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
but
as
to
the
legislative
history,
i
think
that
sort
of
uncertainty
is
going
to
be
easy
to
generate,
and
what
we
do
have
here...
in
addition
to
any
entity,
what
we
do
have
here,
not
just
in
the
legislative
history,
but
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
is,
as
i
said,
agreement
i
think
all
around
that
utilities
are
prominent
among
the
entities
that
congress
envisioned.
i
think
that's
completely
clear.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
true,
justice
stevens.
of
course,
they
could
have
said
private
entity
had
they
meant
that.
that's
not...
i
mean,
our
argument
is
any
entity
means
any
entity.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
think...
i
think
that...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
that
is
the
scheme
although
not
under
253(a).
what
the
commission...
we
know
the
commission's
views
with
unusual
clarity
here.
what
the
commission
said
is
we
think
we've
got
to
say
the
statute
is
not
preempted.
but
as
far
as
the
purposes
of
the...
of
the
act
go,
this
is
a
terrible
state
law.
all
the
purposes
the
state
wants
to
be
accomplished
can
be
accomplished
in
less
restrictive
ways.
the
commission
has
said
that
over
and
over
again
as
emphatically
as
it
can.
and
the
way
to
chevronize,
justice
breyer,
to
use
your
term,
is
by
saying
that
these...
that
municipalities
are
entities,
but
these
admittedly
somewhat
difficult
issues
about
what
special
problems
do
municipalities
pose,
those
should
be
handled
under
253(b),
which
is
what
congress
had
in
mind.
that's...
of
course,
the
states
can
enact
laws
so
that
there
can
be
licensing
requirements
and
basic
fitness
requirements
and
various
kinds
of
regulation...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
as...
as
to
253(a),
justice
scalia,
i
am
absolutely
embracing
that.
i
am
absolutely
embracing
the
notion...
and
maybe
i
disagree
with
justice
breyer
about
this...
that
any
entity
means
any
entity,
and
i
will
go
down
the
line
with
that.
the
reason
that
doesn't
lead
to
absurd
results
like
the
maverick
governor
entering
the
telecommunications
business
against
the
will
of
the
legislature
is
because
of
253(b).
now,
253(b)
is
filled
with
ambiguities
and
complexities
and...
and
problems
that
the
commission
will
have
to
take
the
first
crack
at.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
(b)
does
not
explain
(a).
(a)
has
a
very...
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
it
has
a
very
clear
meaning.
any
entity
means
any
entity,
and
if...
it...
it
would
trivialize
gregory
to
say
that
congress
has
to
say,
and
we
mean
any
entity
whatsoever.
congress
has
to
come
up
with
a...
a
definition.
any
entity
means
any
entity.
in
answer
to
the
charge
that
that
produces
absurd
results,
i
say
no.
congress
left
a
broad
scope
for
state
regulation,
broad
enough
not
only
to
deal
with
absurdities,
but
broad
enough
so
that
these
claims
about
incursions
on
state
sovereignty
are,
i
think,
grossly
overstated.
i
mean,
let
me
draw
the
comparison
to
gregory
directly.
in
gregory,
congress
passed
an
anti-discrimination
law,
an
age
discrimination
law.
the
claim
was
that
that
law
required
states
to
give
their
judges...
their
judges
life
tenure,
a
major
structural
issue.
and
the
court
said,
well,
if
they
had
stopped
at
employees,
maybe
they
would
be
giving
judges
life
tenure,
but
they
said
employees
at
the
policymaking
level
and
that's
just
too
ambiguous
for
us
to
think
congress
was
doing
such
a
dramatic
thing
to
the
structure
of
state
government.
this
is
nothing
like
that.
this...
this
statute
simply
says
that
among
the
universe
of
entrants
that
we
want
in
this
robust,
wide-open,
newly
competitive
field
of
telecommunications,
if
municipal
corporations,
true
to
their
roots
as
corporations,
want
to
get
into
this
business,
the
states
can't
keep
them
out
except
if
they're
doing
the
kinds
of
regulation
that
states
can
reasonably
do
to
private
and
public
corporations
alike.
that
seems
to
me
not
only
a
coherent
reading
of
the
statute,
not
only
one
that
is
consistent
with
what
everyone
agrees
is
the
very
dramatic
pro-competitive
turn
that
the
1996
telecommunications
act
took,
but
also
one
that
really
is
not
a
significant
incursion
on
state
sovereignty,
certainly
not
an
unprecedented
incursion
on
state
sovereignty.
when
decisions
of
this
court
have
held
municipalities
liable
under
the
antitrust
laws,
notwithstanding
state
efforts
to
immunize
them,
liable
for
damages,
notwithstanding
states'
efforts
to
immunize
them,
have
withdrawn
from
municipal
governments
states'
efforts
to
grant
them
sovereign
immunity
against
state
claims
in
the
state
court,
congress...
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
with
their?
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
it
has
to
in
a
sense...
i
agree
with
you,
justice
scalia,
it
doesn't.
in
a
sense,
those
are
more
intrusive
because
what
we
have
here
are
local
government
bodies
who
say
we
want
to
do
this
in
order
to
serve
the
needs
of
our
citizens.
we
don't
have
a
situation
in
which
congress
is
thwarting
the
will
of
both
the
states
and
the
localities.
we
have
a
situation
in
which
localities
want
to
do
this,
in
some
cases
desperately
want
to
do
this,
believe
that
congress,
when
it
said
any
entity
shall
be
free
from
barriers,
believe
that
congress
gave
them
the
power
to
do
it,
subject
of
course
to
reasonable
regulation
by
the
state,
only
to
find
that
gregory
against
ashcroft,
the
decision
that
is
supposedly
designed
to
ensure
that
decisions...
that
government
decisions
are
made
at
a
level
responsive
to
the
people...
gregory
against
ashcroft
is
thrown
up
as
an
obstacle
to
their
doing
what
they
think
is
needed
to
serve
their
citizens'
interests.
and
given
what
seems
to
me
to
be
the
unambiguous
language
of
section
253(a)
and
the
very
limited
circumscribed
focused
nature
of
what
congress
has
done
in
this
circumstance,
it
seems
to
me
to
be
an
unwarranted
conclusion
for
the...
for
the
commission
to
reach.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you.
