are
those
home
rule
states
established
in
that
fashion
by
the
state
constitutions?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
the
language
of
section
253(a)
which
says
no
state
or
local
statute
or
regulation
or
other
state
or
local
legal
requirement
may
prohibit
or
have
the
effect
of
prohibiting.
i'm
not
sure
that...
that
would
reach
a
constitutional
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
any
entity
clear?
i
mean,
what...
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
they
have
to
say
to
make
any...
any
entity
clear?
paren,
and
we
really
mean
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
it
has
to
say
any
entity
whatsoever?
would
that
be
clear?
justice
antonin
scalia
i...
i
suppose
it
would
also
allow
states
to
adopt
a...
a
system
of
chartering
corporations
which
charters
the
corporations
according
to
various
categories,
mining,
manufacturing,
and
it
just
does
not
happen
to
name
the
category
of
telecommunications.
and
that
would
not
be
touched
by...
by
this
type
of
an
interpretation
enabling
the
state
to
create
a
monopoly...
well,
to...
to
exclude
any...
any
telecommunication
company.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by...
by
ambiguous.
what...
what...
the...
the
language
in
gregory
was...
was
employees,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
your
view
does...
of
course,
you're...
you're
into
state
already.
i
mean,
the...
the
state
versus
non-state
was
not
at
issue
in
gregory.
it
was
just
how
far
into
the
state
you
go.
i
mean,
it...
the
whole
thing
applied
to
state...
state
employees,
but
not
at
the
policymaking
level.
what
about
atascadero?
the...
the
language
there
was
any
recipient
of
federal
assistance.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
there
are
various
levels
of...
of
clear
statement
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
was
not
the
only
difference.
justice
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
there
were
other
factors
in
jinks
besides...
besides
just
the
language,
any
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state...
the
state
cannot
tell
it
not
to
enter.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
why
does
it
matter
whether
it's
targeted
or
not?
suppose
it
lists
counties
can
enter
into
the
following
commercial
businesses.
it
lists
seven
or
eight.
it
does
not
list
telecommunications.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what...
what's
your
answer
to
the
hypothetical
i
give
you?
is
that
targeted
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
why
i
asked
it.
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
whether
it's
competitively
neutral.
it's
competitively
neutral.
nobody
can
enter
except
these
fields.
justice
scalia
i
mean...
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we're
going
to
have
to
get
into
inquiring
into
whether
state
legislatures...
well,
of
course...
of
course,
they
didn't
want
it.
it
was
designed
to
keep
them
out
of
telecommunications
because
it
said
these
are
the
only
fields
you
can
get
into.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
your
question
is
whether
it
was
designed
to
keep
them
out
of
telecommunications,
the
answer
is
unquestionably
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
but
if
you
say
it's
okay
if
they
not
only
keep
them
out
of
telecommunications,
but
they
keep
them
out
of
a
lot
of
other
stuff
as
well,
does
that
make
it
okay?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the...
i
don't
even
understand
what
the
factual
inquiry
is.
justice
scalia
what
is
it...
justice
antonin
scalia
that
the
fcc
would
be
looking
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
fcc
is
going
to
decide
what
is
necessary
to
promote...
justice
antonin
scalia
missouri's
public
objectives?
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
would
congress
design
such
a
strange
system
where...
where
the
municipality
can
get
in
and
then
get
out,
but
the
state
can't
allow
the
municipality
to
get
in
and
then
decide,
no,
we
want
to
allow
them
to
get
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
bizarre.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
so
i
understand
you,
a
state
can...
can
grant
certain
powers
to
municipalities,
does
not
have
to
grant
them
the
power
to
enter
into...
into
telecommunications
activity.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
not
have
to
grant
them
that
power.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but...
but
once
they
have
let
them
get
into
telecommunications,
it's...
it's
only
the
municipality
that
can
decide
to
get
out
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but...
but
the
municipality
itself
can
say
we're
going
to
get
out
of
telecommunications.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
cannot
say
no...
no
municipality
shall
do
telecommunications.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say...
you
say
that
that's...
i...
i
could...
i
could
understand
that
there's
no
ambiguity
if
you
simply
say
any
entity
means
any
entity.
but...
but
to
say
that
the
statute...
but
you're
not
willing
to
say
that
it
says
that.
you're
not
willing
to
say
that...
that
the
state
cannot
prohibit
its...
its
counties
from
entering
into
commercial
activities.
that
would
certainly
have
the
effect,
which
is
all
this
requires...
have
the
effect
of
prohibiting
the
ability
of
counties
to
provide
interstate
or
intrastate...
you're
not
willing
to
say
that.
you...
you
insist
that
we
derive
this
very
subtle
distinction
between
the
state
initially
granting
it
and
then
taking
it
away
or
the
county
taking
it
away
itself.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
unambiguously
within
the
statute
at
all.
what's...
what
the
unambiguous
choices
are
are
that
the
states
are
not
included
or
that
the
states
are
included,
and
that
means
that...
that
the
states
cannot
exclude
counties
or,
for
that
matter,
even
departments
of
the
state
government
itself
from
entering
into
the
telecommunications
business.
that
would
be
unambiguous.
but
if
you're
not
willing
to
embrace
that,
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
that
the
statute
is
ambiguous.
justice
scalia
impact
upon
(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
you...
you
can't
use
(b)
to
explain
(a)
and
then
say,
oh,
yes,
(b)
is
ambiguous.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
using
an
ambiguous
(b)
to
explain
(a),
(a)
itself
is
ambiguous.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
authorities,
all
of
those
instances
you
mentioned.
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
their
authority.
justice
antonin
scalia
authority
under
state
law.
