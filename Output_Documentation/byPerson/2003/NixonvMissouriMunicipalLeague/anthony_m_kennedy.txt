justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
it
your
view
that
in
all
instances
we
must
interpret
this
statute
so
that
any
entity...
that
phrase...
does
not
include
a
local
subdivision
of
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
would
be
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
are
there
other
circumstances
in
which
it
would
not
intrude
on
the
right
of
the
state
to
allocate
powers
between
itself
and
the
localities
so
that
this
statute...
so
that
this
interpretation
would
have
an
effect
in
some
other
instance?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
suppose
that
a
state
says
that
no
political
subdivision
in
this
state
shall
have
the
telecommunications
facility
that
does
interactive
television
unless
the
carrier
that
it
contracts
with
pays
the
city
a
fee
of
$1
million.
could
the
state
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you'd
say...
in
other
words,
it's
conditioning
the
ability
of
its
subdivisions
to
engage
in
this
by
demanding
that
it
extract
certain
financial
consideration,
and
suppose
that
this
is
prohibitive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose...
suppose...
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
word,
any
entity,
cover
the
state
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
the
governor
is
about
to
sign
a
contract
to...
to
allow
the
state
to
enter
into
communications
facilities
and
the
legislature
instructs
him
not
to,
that
statute
is
void?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
don't
neutral
principles
of
corporate
governance
apply
to
the
relations
between
the
state
and
its
subdivisions?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there's
a
constitutional
provision.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
say
that
it
can't
be
made
precise
to
telecommunications.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
my
example
in
the
state
hypothetical,
in
the
first
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
here
it
was
operating
as
a
general
rule
that
subdivisions
have
to
do
what
the
state
tells
them
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
see
why
the
general
rule
applies
in
one
instance
and
not
the
other,
given
your
definition
of
entity.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
those
are
all
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
where
the
thirteenth...
fourteenth
amendment
altered
the
federal
balance
with
reference
to
those.
that's
not
what's
involved
here.
