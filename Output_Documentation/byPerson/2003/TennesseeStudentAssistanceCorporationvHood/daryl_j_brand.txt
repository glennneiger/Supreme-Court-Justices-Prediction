mr.
daryl
j.
brand
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court's
decisions
recognize
that
even
in
subject
areas
where
article
i
grants
congress
complete
and
exclusive
authority
to
make
laws,
unconsenting
states
are
still
immune
from
suits
by
private
parties.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
certainly,
your
honor.
we
would
submit
that
there...
there
is
no
authority
from
this
court
supporting
the
view
that
there
is
an
in
rem
exception
from
sovereign
immunity
in
the
bankruptcy
context.
the
argument
instead
is
made
by
analogy,
as
your
honor
referred,
to
the...
the
admiralty
case
of
deep
sea
research,
but
the
deep
sea
research
case
is
limited
to
the
admiralty
context.
it's
limited
to
the
special
aspects
of
admiralty
law
that
had
developed
over
hundreds
of
years,
certainly
200
years
of...
of
our
nation's
experience.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
your
honor,
although
there
certainly
are
in
rem
aspects
to
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
in
the
context
of
dealing
with
the
property
of
the
estate
that
is
before
the
court
and
that
is
in
the
custody
of
the
court,
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
also
embraces
other...
other
aspects
of
in
personam
jurisdiction
involving
the
parties
and...
and
personal
relationships.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
your
honor,
there...
there
is
authority
from...
from
the
lower
courts
that...
that
it
could
in
fact,
and
that
in...
in
that
situation,
the...
the
state
might
be
bound
by
a
general
discharge
order.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
that's...
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
it
also
is
a
situation
in
which
the
state
was
not
making
a
claim
against
the...
the
property
of
the
bankrupt
estate.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
and
that--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--i
don't
want
to
concede
that
point,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
authority
certainly
that
would...
that
could
support
that,
and
there
are
decisions
from
the...
from
the
circuit
courts,
particularly
the
fourth,
the
fifth,
and
the
ninth,
which
have
held
that
a
discharge
order
under
those
circumstances
would
be
binding
against
the
state.
but
each
of
those
courts
has
also
upheld
sovereign
immunity
as
a
bar
to
a
suit
against
a
state
as
the
state
asserts
in
this
case.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
that's
right,
your
honor,
except
that--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--yes.
she
is...
she
has
already
received
a
bankruptcy
discharge,
a
blanket
discharge
from
debt.
this
is
a
proceeding
to
determine
if
this
particular
debt
qualifies
under
that.
and
the
way
the
statute
is
written,
the
way...
the
way
congress
has
set
this
up
is
that
the
debt
is
presumptively
nondischargeable.
it
is
an
exception
from
discharge
until
such
point
as
the
debtor
establishes
undue
hardship,
at
which
point
the
debt
would
be
absolved
and
she
would...
she
would,
in
effect,
have
a
discharge.
but
again,
the...
by...
by
the
nature
of
the
way
the--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--no,
it
wouldn't,
your
honor.
a
normal
discharge
case
would
essentially
not
involve
at
all
the
adjudication
of
individual
debts.
the
discharge
is--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--it...
it...
yes,
if
i'm
understanding,
your
honor.
yes,
she
would
have,
in
effect,
a
discharge
from
that
debt.
yes.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
i
think
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
the
debt
could
be
treated
as
a
discharged
debt,
in
which
case
the
state
would
certainly
be
bound
by
the
operation
of
that
law,
but
that
is
not--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--no,
your
honor.
i...
i
would
submit
our
argument...
our
argument
is
not
that
the
state
is
immune
from
the
effect
of
the
statute
that
would
allow
discharge
upon
showing
of
undue
hardship.
we
would
recognize
that
that
is...
that
is
an
appropriate
part
of
the...
of
the
exercise
of
congress'
bankruptcy
power.
our
issue
is
with
the
provisions
which
are
there
by
virtue
of
the
nature
of
the
way
that...
that
exception
is
written
and
also
by
virtue
of
the
bankruptcy
rules
that
require
that
it
be
raised
in
the
form
of
an
adversary
proceeding
in
which
the
state
could
be
summoned
into
court,
in
bankruptcy
court,
anywhere
in
the
country.
well,
could
it
be
adjudicated
without
an
adversary
proceeding,
just
say
the
debtor
comes
in
and
says,
i'm
giving
notice
to
the
state?
if
they
want
to
come
in,
they
can,
but
it's
not...
it's...
i'm
not
going
to
call
it
or
the
statute
doesn't
call
it
a
summons
and
complaint,
doesn't
call
it
an
adversary
proceeding,
just
a
proceeding
to
establish
the
status
of
this
obligation.
your
honor,
i
think
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
congress
could
write
a
statute
that
would
make
a
student
loan
dischargeable,
more
or
less
by
operation
of
law,
but
we
would
submit
that
the
way
this
statute
is
written...
and
again,
if
we
look--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
would.
i
think
that
in
substance
that
would
be
essentially
the
same
as
the
adversary
complaint
that...
that
we're
talking
about
here.
and...
and
under...
under
coeur
d'alene
and...
and
the
discussion
in
other
similar
cases,
the
question
here
can't
turn
on
the
mechanics
of
the
pleading
or
on
the...
the
style
of
the
caption.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
i'm
not...
i'm
not
certain
that
that
would
not
be
the
same
type
of
statute
that
i...
i
objected
to
a
moment
ago.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
i...
i
agreed,
your
honor,
and
i
still
agree
that...
that
congress
could
fashion
a
statute
that
would
make
student
loans
dischargeable
in
the
same
manner
as...
as
any
other
debt.
and
in...
in
that
case,
it...
it
would
take
place
the
same
as
any
other
debt.
and
of
course,
if...
if
the
state
were
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
and
enter
into
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
and...
and
voluntarily
participate,
then...
then
it
could
do
and...
and
the
court
could
act
accordingly
without
any
special
enabling
legislation
by
congress.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
believe
that
this
statute...
this
particular
subsection
affecting
student
loan
discharge
is
really
unique
within
the
exceptions
to
discharge.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
there--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--congress--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--your
honor,
we...
we
do
not
dispute
that
congress
has
the
power
to
set
a
separate
standard
for
this
type
of
debt--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--well,
the...
the
question
is
not
the
effectiveness
of
the
congressional
determination
regarding
how
to
handle
that
debt,
but
rather
the
constitutionality
of
the
means
by
which
congress--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--well,
your
honor,
our
objection
is
not
merely
to
the
bankruptcy
rules.
i
would...
i
would
repeat
that...
that--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--oh,
certainly
not,
your
honor.
certainly
not.
and
i
thought
that
we
were
clear
in
our
briefing
that
we...
we
recognize
that
the...
the
state
would
be
bound
by
the
automatic
stay
because
it's
automatic.
it
is
by
operation
of
law
and
by
operation
of
the
supremacy
clause--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--your
honor,
i
agree
that
congress
can
make
those
distinctions.
i--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--i
disagree
with
it
because
the...
the
legislative
reports
as
to
that
subsection,
section
5239(a)(8),
strongly
point
out
that
the
statute...
that
that
subsection
is
intended
to
be
self-executing
and
that
the
creditor,
the
lender,
the
guaranteer,
the...
the
guarantee
institution,
are
not
required
to
initiate
action
but
instead
can
rely
on
the
nondischarge,
on
the
exception
from
discharge.
so
by...
by
structuring
the...
the
exception
that
way,
we
would
submit
that
congress,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
other
situations,
has
given
elevated
status
to
that
creditor's
position,
has
recognized
that
creditors
of
those
kinds
of
debts
have
interests
in
the
payment
of
those
debts
that
outweigh
the
normal
fresh-start
policy
that...
that
underlies
bankruptcy.
so
our
position
is
that
it
does
turn
on
the
nature
of
the
statute
and
not
merely
those
bankruptcy
rules
that
require--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--certainly
not
by
express
terms,
your
honor,
but...
but
again,
the
rules...
rules
made
consistent
with
that
statute,
together
with
that
legislative
purpose,
would
certainly
indicate
that...
that--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--oh--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
there's
no
dispute
about
that.
i
mean,
this--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--except
that
ordinary
proceedings
in
bankruptcy,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
do
not
involve
the
individualized
adjudication
of
debts.
they
involve
other
issues.
they
involve
martialing
the
assets.
they
involve
assessing
the--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--certainly,
your
honor,
and
the--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--yes,
your
honor,
and
the
reason...
the
reason
i
agree
to
that
is
because
that
does
not
require
an
adjudication.
it...
it
would
occur
by
operation
of
law
by
which--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--but
we
would
submit
in
a...
in
a
very
real
sense
that
would
be
surplusage.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
that's...
that's
right
when
the
discharge
is
by
operation
of
law.
and
again,
i
would
analogize
to
the...
the
situation
of
the
automatic
stay
provision
that...
that
justice
o'connor
raised.
again,
that
operates
automatically
when
the--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--possibly,
possibly
not.
again,
i
would
submit
that
there's
authority
from
lower
courts
that
would...
would
possibly--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--in
this
case
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
protects
the
state
from
being
made
a
defendant
and
from
having
compulsory
process
issued
against
it
to
appear
in
a
bankruptcy
court
that
could
be
in
any
state
of
the
union
in
this
case.
now,
the...
the
reason
i
was
referring
to
authority
from
other
courts
is
to...
is
to
remind
the
court
that
all
of
the
courts
that
have...
that
have
made
the
type
of
holding
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
have
also
recognized
the
applicability
of
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
adversary
settings.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
again--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--again,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
we're
talking
about
very
different
things
there.
there
is...
there
is
quite
a
difference
between
the
general
discharge,
which
again
occurs
without
individualized
adjudication
of...
of
debts...
that
is...
that
is
a
distinct
thing
under
the
bankruptcy
laws
from
a
situation
in...
in
which
there's
a
proceeding
involving
the
dischargeability
of
a
particular
debt--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--such
as
we
have
here.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
in...
in
a
case
where
the
state
had
filed
a
claim,
the
state
would
have
voluntarily
appeared
in
the...
in
the
proceeding
as
relates
to
the
subject
matter
of
that
claim.
so
there
would
not
be
any
sovereign
immunity
situation
there
at
all.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
as
to
that
claim,
yes.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
yes,
i
believe
so.
yes,
gardner
v.
new
jersey.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
i...
i
believe
so,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
certain
if
that
is
applicable
in
every...
in
every
district.
and
i'm
not...
i
apologize.
i'm
not
certain
as
to
that.
i
know
the
u.s.
trustees
have...
have
those
powers
and
responsibilities
in
at
least...
at
least
a
good
number
of
bankruptcy--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--well,
certainly
that
would
be
a
different
situation
and
certainly
the
state--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--that's
right,
your
honor.
that's...
that's
conceivable.
certainly
the
state
would
have
no
sovereign
immunity
from...
from
an
action
by
the
united
states.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
certainly
any
lending
institution
could...
could
be
involved
as
a...
as
a
creditor
in
a
student
loan.
the...
the
federal
and...
and
i
guess
there
are
state
programs
as
well,
but
involve
fairly
complicated
relationships
between
lending
institutions
and
secondary
holders
and
guarantors
at...
at
various
levels.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
well,
the...
i...
i
can
speak
for
the
state
of
tennessee.
the
state
of
tennessee
is
involved
as
a
guarantor,
not
as
a
lender,
but
merely
as
a
guarantor
in
conjunction
mainly
with
these...
these
federal
loan
programs.
and
the...
the
state
of
tennessee
is
participating
not
as
a...
a
business
actor,
but
as
a
means
of...
of
pursuing
the
public
policy
of
making
it
simpler
and
easier
for
tennessee
residents
to
obtain
a
college
education.
so
the...
the
state
as
a
guarantor
is...
is
not
in
this...
in
the
position
at
all
of
an
ordinary
creditor,
really,
as
far
as
its...
as
far
as
its
purpose
and...
and
even
as
far
as
its...
probably
its
financial
calculations
in...
in
how
to
deal
with
that.
again,
it's...
it's
a
matter
of
pursuing
the
public
policy
of
making
it
easier
for...
for
the
students,
for
these
debtors
to
obtain
their
college
education.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
i...
i
believe...
i
believe,
your
honor,
certainly
the...
the
initial
creditor
could
certainly
be
involved,
would
have
no
sovereign
immunity
defense.
there
would
still
be
the
requirement
of
the
undue
hardship
showing.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
it
certainly
would,
your
honor,
but
it
also
could
create
complications
as
far
as...
as
far
as
whether
states
would
choose
to
participate
in...
in
student
loan
programs.
again,
it's
a
policy
determination
made
state
by
state.
there's
no
requirement
that
the
states
participate
in...
in
such
programs.
it...
it's
part
of
the
balancing
of
those
interests
i
think
that
has
resulted
in
this
statute
and
in
this
statute
being
written
the
way
it
is.
at
one
point
in
time
not
too
long
ago,
student
loans
were
discharged
in
an
ordinary
bankruptcy,
and
then
it
was...
it
was
cut
back
to
only
loans
that
had
been
in...
in
payment
more
than...
more
than
5...
more
than
7
years
and
more
than
5
years,
and
now,
of
course,
it's
cut
back
all
the
way
to
where
it's
only
subject
to
discharge
upon
a
showing
of
undue
hardship.
so
there's...
there's
definitely
a
policy
of
wanting
to
make
student
loan
repayment
more
certain
and
make
that
a...
a
different
relationship
from
other
debtor/creditor
relationships.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
our
time.
i
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
sixth
circuit
be
reversed.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state's
position
in
this
case
is
that
a
proceeding
under
the
law
which
requires
the
state
to
make
a
choice
between
voluntarily
entering
the
proceeding
or
sitting
back
and
suffering
a
loss
of
its...
of
its
rights
is
every
bit
as
coercive
whether
it's
styled
as
a
motion
or
an
adversary
proceeding
or...
or
anything
else,
is
every
bit
as
coercive
as
a
lawsuit
similar
to
the...
the
situation
with
the
administrative
proceedings
in
the
federal
maritime
commission
case.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
i
am
not
certain,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
an
undue
hardship
showing
would
still
be
necessary.
but
in
either...
in
either
situation,
the
state
would
suffer
the
consequences
of
losing
its
rights
subject
to
an
adjudication,
not
subject
to
the
mere
operation
of
law
as
with
the
general
discharge
at
the
conclusion
of
a...
of
an
ordinary
bankruptcy
proceeding.
as...
as
far
as
the
preference
actions
go,
this
case...
i'm
sorry...
this
court
decided
in
hoffman
v.
connecticut
which
involved
a
preference
action
and
even
more
than
that,
a
turnover
action
where
there
actually
was
property
of
the
estate
that
the...
that
the
bankrupt
trustee
was...
was
entitled
to
recover,
that
in
either
of
those
types
of
situations,
the
eleventh
amendment
applied.
now,
of
course,
that
case
turned
on
whether
congress
had...
had
made
a
clear
statement
in
the
statute,
but
in
any
event,
the
court,
having
found
that
the...
that
the
congress
did
not
make
a
clear
statement
of
intent
to
override
sovereign
immunity,
applied
the
eleventh
amendment
to
that
preference
action,
that
turnover
action
in
that
case.
now,
in
this
case
we
have
no
property.
the...
the
debtor
is
not
seeking
to...
to
get
property.
the...
the
creditor
is
not
seeking
to
make
a
claim
out
of
the
property
of
the
estate.
so
we
would
submit
that...
that
the
court
can
decide
this
case,
which
involves
a
simple
adversary
proceeding
on
its
face,
the
issuance
of
compulsory
process
without
even
reaching
the
question
of
whether
a
similar
effect
would...
would
occur
in...
in
a
preference
action
or
in
any
other
type
of
bankruptcy
action.
so
i'd
like
to
emphasize
to
the
court
that
this
is
an
unusual
statute,
and
the
question
in
this
case
is,
does
the
eleventh
amendment
apply
in
the
bankruptcy
context?
but
the
precise
circumstances
of
this
case
can
well
limit
a
court's
holding
to
the
question
of
whether
sovereign
immunity
protects
the
state
in
an
adversary
proceeding
on
this
particular
type
of
statute
for
a
particular
exception
from
discharge.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--it's--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--it's
hoffman
v.
connecticut.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
it's
a
1989
case--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--in
which...
in
which
the...
the
plurality
of
the
court
found
that
congress
had
not
made
a
clear
statement
of
intent
to
override
sovereign
immunity,
but
in
which
two
justices
found
that
in
any
event
congress
had
no
constitutional
authority
to
override
eleventh
amendment
immunity
in
such
a
setting.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
again
we--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--well,
we...
we
did
not
mean
that
she
would
have
obtained
the
undue
hardship
finding
from
the...
the
bankruptcy
court,
but
that
she
could
raise
the
issue
of
undue
hardship
in
whatever
state
proceeding
was
initiated
by
the
state.
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
your
honor,
may
i
answer
the
question?
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
the
answer
is,
as
your
honor
suggests,
the
primary...
the
primary
means
under
the
student
loan
program
would
be
through
wage
garnishments
and
through
tax
intercepts,
but
the
federal
regulations
and
state
law
would
afford
the
debtor
opportunity
for
administrative
proceedings
to
raise
the
undue
hardship
issue
and
prove
that
she
should
be
absolved
from
the
student
loan
debt.
so
there
are
state
remedies
available
in
the
context
not
of
a
state
court--
mr.
daryl
j.
brand
--thank
you,
your
honor.
