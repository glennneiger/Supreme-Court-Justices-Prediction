mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
questioning
of
the
petitioner
reflected
the
fact
that
there
is
an
inherent
conflict
between
the
requirements
of
the
operation
of
the
bankruptcy
system
and
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
this
conflict
has
been
recognized
in
this
court's
past
opinions.
for
example,
in
van
huffel
v.
harkelrode,
a
1931
decision
of
this
court,
it
was
claimed
that
the
sale
of
a
debtor's
property
free
and
clear
of...
of
the
state's
tax
lien
was
not
effective
but
the
state
lacked
jurisdiction.
this--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--jurisdiction
over
the--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--i'm...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
state.
and
this
court
denied
that...
the
state's
position.
subsequent
to
that
in
gardner/new
jersey,
which
is
a
case
that...
that
which
is
noted
for
waiver,
the
state
also
took
the
position
that
not...
that
the
property
that
was
a
part
of
the
debtor's
estate
was
limited
to
the
debtor's
equity
and
did
not
include
that
portion
of
the
property
of
the
debtor
that
was
subject
to
the
state's
tax
lien.
again,
this
court
said,
no,
all
property
of
the
debtor
is
part
of
the
estate,
including
that
part
that's
subject
to
a
state's
tax
lien.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
opinion...
that
portion
of
the
opinion
in
gardner
that
addresses
that
issue
does
not
rely
upon
the
fact
that
the
state
filed
a
proof
of
claim.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
to
allow
this
case
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
that
an
adversary
proceeding
had
been
filed
would
be
elevating
form
over
substance
because
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
with
respect
to
the
claim
arises
from
the
court's
jurisdiction
over
the
property
of
the
estate
and
claims
made
against
it
and
the...
and
the
debtor.
they're
all
part
of
the
res.
so
the
filing
of
an
adversary
proceeding
was
merely
a
manner...
merely
allowing
the
state
to...
to
be
provided
with
an
elevated
form
of
notice
rather
than
being
jurisdictional.
in
addition,
28
u.s.c.
2075
states
that
the
rules,
bankruptcy
rules,
should
not
in
any
way
abridge
or
modify
the
substantive
rights
that
are
granted
under
the
code,
and
i
believe
in
these
circumstances
to
allow
this
decision
to
be
based
upon
the
fact
that
an
adversary
proceeding
had
been
filed
would
have
the
effect
of
abridging
ms.
hood's
rights--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--by
denying
here
an
opportunity
for
hardship.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
a
default
judgment
is
entered.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
yes.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
i
would...
i'd
like--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--yes,
and
i...
i
believe
i
incorrectly
stated
what
would
happen,
your
honor.
it's...
even...
even
in
an
adversary
proceeding,
the
court
would
still
have
to
find
that
ms.
hood
had
demonstrated
a
right
to
a...
to
an
undue
hardship
discharge.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
the
amount
is
at
issue
only
to
the
extent
that
in
order
to
show
undue
hardship,
ms.
hood
has
to
demonstrate
that
she
can't
repay
it.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
no,
it's
not.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
well,
justice
breyer,
very
often
adversary
proceedings
are
commenced
in
bankruptcy
court
and
they're
necessary
when
the
kind
of
action
that
dispute...
in
dispute
is
the
equivalent
of
an
action
that
could
have
been
commenced
prior
to
the
establishment
of
the
bankruptcy.
it's
just--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--prior,
you
know,
action
now
brought
into
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
then
the
bankruptcy
court
could
issue
a
default
judgment
because--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--it
would
be
a
traditional
action.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
with
respect
to
a
voidable
preference,
if...
if
the
defendant
did
not
demonstrate
it
had
any
defense,
a
judgment
would
be
issued
in
favor
of
the...
the
state
because
there
is
a
presumption
for
a
voidable
preference
once
certain
factors
are
met.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it
is
not
ms.
hood's
position
in
this
case
that
a
preference
action
would
fall
within
the
traditional
in
rem
jurisdiction
of
a
bankruptcy
court
and
thus
the
state
sovereign
immunity
would
be
abrogated.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
i...
that
issue
is
unclear,
your
honor.
it's
certainly
not
ms.
hood's
position
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
not
prevail.
and
there's
actually
a
case
pending
before
this
court
right
now,
massachusetts
v.
h.j.
wilson,
where
at
issue
is
the
debtor's
demand
for
an
income
tax
refund.
so
the
opportunity
to
visit
the
issue
of
affirmative
money
relief
against
a
state
and
its...
and
the
ramifications
of
the
eleventh
amendment
can
be
addressed
in
that
case.
it's--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--yes.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
it
would...
it
would
not
be
a
default
judgment,
your
honor.
it
would
be
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
it
would
be
a
judgment--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--oh,
to...
to
the
extent
it
is...
there's
greater
flexibility
of
a
defendant
to
come
back
and
ask
for
reconsideration,
i
believe,
under
normal
procedures.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
i
think
it
comes
from
the
natural
reading
of
the
statute
that
such
a
finding
has
to
be
made
that
there
would
be
an
undue
hardship
for
the
debtor
to
have
to
repay
that...
that
loan.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
the
difference...
the
difference
is...
your
honor,
is
that
all
of
the
property
of
a
debtor
and
claims
against
that
property...
they're...
they're
all
under
the
bankruptcy
court's
jurisdiction.
so
a
bankruptcy
court
has
a
special
obligation
to...
to
protect
the
interests
of
all
creditors
and
the
estate,
and
i
believe
because
of
that,
it
would
have
a
heightened
responsibility
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
basis
for
an
undue
hardship
discharge
because
the
decision
is
not
solely...
is...
is
affecting
everyone.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
i...
there
is
a
question
that--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--with...
with
regard
to
a
voidable
preference
action
whether
the
funds
the
debtor
would
be
seeking
would
be
part
of
the
res
because
it's
not
in
the
possession
of
the
estate.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
and
certainly
that
distinction
can
be
made
as
made
in
california
v....
v.
deep
sea
research,
that
if
the
property
is
in
the
possession
of
the...
of
the
state,
rather
than
the
debtor,
a
different
result
is
required
with
respect
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
yes,
it
could,
your
honor.
and...
and
the
basis
for
that
would
be
to
reconciling
the
requirements
of
28
u.s.c.
2075
and
the
requirement
for
the
bankruptcy
rules
because
under
105,
a
court
could
rule
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
enforce
the
requirement
of
bankruptcy
rule
7001,
which
requires
an
adversary
proceeding.
so
105
would
give
a
bankruptcy
court
that
power
and
i
believe
it
would
be
an
appropriate
exercise
of
that
power.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
because
the
debtor
itself,
at
least
the
pre-petition
debtor,
is
also
considered
part
of
the
res,
part
of
the
bankruptcy
court's
in
rem
jurisdiction.
that
was
reflected
in
hanover
national
bank
v.
moyses
where
the
creditor
complained
that
its
debt
had
been
discharged,
but
it
had
never
received...
no
summons
or
complaint
had
ever
been
filed.
in
fact,
it
complained
it
had
never
received
notice.
and
this
court's
response
was,
no,
bankruptcy
is
a
form
of
in
rem
jurisdiction,
and
on
that
basis
the...
the
claim
of
that
creditor
could
be
discharged
even
though
no
adversary...
no
summons
and
complaint
was
filed.
notice
as
a
motion
was
sufficient,
and
it
based--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
know
it
doesn't
entirely
fit
our
traditional
notions
of
what
a
res
is,
but
it's
consistent
with
how
this
court
has
traditionally
understood
the
in
rem
jurisdiction
of
a
bankruptcy
court
and
the
needs
of
a
bankruptcy
court
to
satisfy
its
essential
functions.
the
kinds
of
contradictions
that
are
being
raised
in
the
questioning
are
reflective
of
what's
happened
in
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
where
the
fourth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit,
the
ninth
circuit
all
have
recognized
and
have
stated
in...
in
earlier
opinions
that
the
seminole
tribe
doctrine
applied
in
bankruptcy
but
later
recognized
an
in
rem
exception
to
allow
for
the
discharge
of
debts
with
respect
to
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
and...
and
the
fourth
circuit,
and
the
fourth
circuit
also
recognized
that
principle
with
respect
to
the
confirmation
of
a
plan
and
its
binding
effect
upon
a
state.
so
right
now
bankruptcy
law
is
in
an
inconsistent
muddle
with
respect
to
the
applicability
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
this
case
allows
this
court
an
opportunity
to
reconcile
that
inconsistency
as--
mr.
leonard
h.
gerson
--that's...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
of
course,
this
court
could
rule
that
given
the
traditional
in
rem
nature
of
a
bankruptcy
and
the
fact
that,
particularly
under
the
bankruptcy
act
a
preference,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
was
not
part
of
the
bankruptcy
summary
jurisdiction
but
required
a
plenary
action,
that
in
fact
actions
requiring
any
affirmative
monetary
relief
against
a
state
are
not
part
of
a
debtor's...
are
not
part
of
a
bankruptcy
court's
in
rem
jurisdiction,
if
it
chose.
if
there
are
no
more
questions,
thank
you.
