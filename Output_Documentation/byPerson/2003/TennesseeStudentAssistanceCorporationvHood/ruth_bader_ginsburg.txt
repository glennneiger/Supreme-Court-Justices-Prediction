isn't
it...
isn't
it
odd
that
you
are
objecting
to
this
proceeding
where,
if
congress
then
said,
okay,
we'll
make
it
dischargeable,
you
will
be
worse
off?
in
other
words,
congress
is
trying
to
ameliorate
the
ordinary
effect
of
the
bankruptcy
law
to
give
the
state
an
advantage.
and
your
argument
is
to
the
effect
of,
congress,
you
can
treat
us
just
like
all
the
others,
and
we'll
be
worse
off
than
we
are
now,
but
once
you
give
us
this
favor,
then
you...
the...
the
law
is
unconstitutional.
you
can't
give
us
a
favor.
that
seems
to
be
the
essence
of
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
asking
about
making
it
totally
dischargeable,
but
congress
wants
to
achieve
this
result
and
sensitive
to
your
concern.
so
it
says,
fine,
we're
going
to
make
it
nondischargeable
unless
the
student
shows
undue
hardship,
but
because
the
state
doesn't
want
to
receive
a
summons
and
complaint,
we're
going
to
do
it
in
a
nonadversary
proceeding.
the
student
will
establish
it
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
bankruptcy
court
or
not,
and
the
state
will
be
given
notice
but
not
a
summons
and
complaint.
would
that
be
satisfactory?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in...
in
a
world
of
limited
resources,
especially
for
the
u.s.
trustee...
this
is
a
no-asset
bankruptcy.
if
the
u.s.
trustee
is
going
to
come
into
each
one
of
these
proceedings,
it
might
be
rather
impractical.
i
was
curious
about
the
credit...
the
creditor
class
for
these
student
loans.
it's
not
just
states
that
are
creditors
when
a
student
tries
to
get
out
from
under
the
student's
debts.
what...
what
other
entities
would
be
in
this
situation,
not
with
respect
to
sovereign
immunity,
but
as
someone
who
has
loaned
money
to
a
student?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what
part
of
the
business
the
states
have,
to
what
extent,
compared
to
other
creditors,
other
lenders?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
for...
for
the
primary
lender,
this
procedure
would
be
fine.
the...
so
the
debt
wouldn't
be
dischargeable
to
the
initial
creditor,
the
one
who
loans--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
you...
if
you...
congress
was
to
say,
well,
too
bad,
we
tried
to
give
them
a
break,
we
can't
do
it,
so
we're
going
to
make
them
dischargeable
just
like
any
other
debt,
that
would
have
a
very
adverse
effect
on
all
the
other
creditors
in
the
picture
who
are
not
state
actors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
doesn't
make
it
not
a
decision
on
the
merits.
it
may
be
subject
to
reopening,
but
a
default
judgment
is
a
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
question
we...
we
were
talking
about
before...
that
there
was
a
clear
and
certain
answer
to
the
question,
that...
that
if
the
claim
is
made
that
there's
undue
hardship,
even
if
the
state
doesn't
show
up...
well,
let's
take
the...
because
this
is
written
for
all
creditors
and
not
particularly
with
states
in
mind.
if
the
creditor
doesn't
show
up,
the
bankruptcy
judge
still
has
to
find
that
there's
undue
hardship
in
order
to
make
this
dischargeable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where
does
that
come
from?
i...
that
was
my
understanding
about
the
way
it
works,
but
is
that
a
statute,
a
rule?
where
does...
where
does
that
come
from?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gerson,
you...
your
position
depends
heavily
on
the
characterization
of
bankruptcy
proceedings
as
in
rem,
and
one
can
understand
that
about
the
bankrupt
estate,
it
collects
whatever
assets
there
are
and
distributes
them.
but
this
is
a
no-asset
bankruptcy.
so
how
does
the
in
rem
characterization
fit
a
case
where
there
are
no
assets?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
you're
saying
is
the...
is
the
debtor
is
not
a
thing,
is
not
a
res,
but
a
debtor...
this
is
an
adjudication
over
a
status
which
traditionally
is
also
in
rem.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
only
a
small
piece
of
it,
according
to
what
you
told
us
earlier,
because
you
said
this
doesn't
involve
the
preference
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
had
one.
and
it
was
in...
your
brief
said,
well,
it's
not
that
the
bankruptcy
law
doesn't
find
the
states
so
that,
for
example,
if
the
state
as
creditor
would
sue
the
student
after
she's
been
discharged
in
bankruptcy,
she
could
then
as
a
defense
say,
i'm
not
liable
on
this
debt.
it's
been
discharged.
i
got
the
undue
hardship
finding
from
the
bankruptcy
court.
that...
you
did
say
that
in
your
brief
that
that
would
be...
that...
that
she
could
have
this
as
a
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
would
the
state
ever
initiate
such
a
proceeding
when
it
has
much
easier...
it
can
garnish
wages.
it
can
intercept
tax
refunds.
