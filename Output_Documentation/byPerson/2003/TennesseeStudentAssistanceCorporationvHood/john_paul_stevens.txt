justice
john
paul
stevens
but
this
is
not
a
normal
suit
against
the
state.
this
is
a
suit
in
which
the
debtor
seeks
authority
to
get
a
discharge,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
proceeding
itself
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
she's
entitled
to
a
discharge
on
the
debt
at
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
she...
if
she
prevails
in
that
disputed
factual
matter,
then
it
will
be
just
like
any
other
discharge
case.
if...
if
the
hearing
goes
forward
and
she
prevails
as
a
matter
of
fact,
then
it
would
be
just
like
any
other
discharge
case,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
i'm
saying
if
she
prevails
on
the
disputed
issues
of
fact,
thereafter
it
would
be
just
like
a
normal
discharge
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
brand,
can
i
ask
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
one
question?
did
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say
that
you
did
not
contest
the
fact
that
if...
if...
that
if
they
had
a
blanket
rule
that
all
student
loans
are
automatically
dischargeable,
that
would
be
true
even
if
the
creditor
was
a
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
does
that
mean
you
also
would
agree
that
any
ordinary
commercial
obligation
to
the
state
such
as
paying
rent
for
an...
an
office
suite
or
something
like
that
could
also
be
dischargeable
and
there
would
be
no
sovereign
immunity
problem
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
there
has
to
be...
there
has
to
be
a
final
order
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
discharging...
you
know,
giving
the...
the
debtor
a
discharge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the...
but
the
net
result
is
i
thought
your
position
in
your
brief
was
somewhat
different
from
that.
that's
why
i
wanted
to
be
sure
about
it.
you
do
agree
that...
that
the
sovereign
immunity
is
not
a
valid
objection
to
a
discharge
of
a
bankrupt
estate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
but
the
difference
in
the
automatic
stay
if
the...
if
the
debtor
had
to
go
in
and
prove
his
name,
serial
number,
and
rank
or
something
first,
so
it
wasn't
completely
automatic,
then
you
would
say
you
have
a
sovereign
immunity
objection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
really
not
so
much
interested
in
the
authority
from
the
lower
courts
as
i
am
curious
about
your
position.
what
exactly
does
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
protect
for
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
anomalous
to
say
that
if
you
want
to
do
it
without
giving
us
a
hearing,
you
can
go
ahead
and
do
it,
but
if
you
give
us
notice
and
a
hearing
and
an
opportunity
to
respond,
then
you're
protected
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
rather
strange
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
say--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
could
well
be
that
the
state
filed
a
claim
and
proved
up
its
claim
and
then
there's
not
enough
money
to
pay
it,
the
claim,
but
there
would
be
some
kind
of
proceeding
to
establish
the
claim.
would
that
be
different
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the
state
voluntarily
appears,
it
would
automatically
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
do
have.
would
you
tell
me
again,
what...
what's
the
cite
to
the
case
about
the
turnover
that
you
just
cited?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
the
name
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
hoffman,
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
