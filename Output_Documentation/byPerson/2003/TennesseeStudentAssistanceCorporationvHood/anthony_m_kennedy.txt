well,
could
we
just
stick
with
the
in
rem
for
a
moment?
suppose
there's
a
$100,000
on
the
usual
free-for-all
because
there
are
more...
the...
the
debts
exceed
that
amount.
the
state
gets
notice.
it
decides
it's
not
going
to
appear.
the
bankrupt
is...
is
discharged.
at
the
very
least,
if
the
state
then
later
sues
on
the
debt,
is
the...
can
the
discharge
be
set
up
as
a
defense?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
it's
hard
to
think
of
a
debt
as
part
of
a
res.
i...
i
can't
quite--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--get
that.
and
i
understand,
but
just
on
the
basic
point
of
whether
or
not
just
for
a
discharge
of
a
debt,
the
state
can
be
bound,
you
say
you
think
it
might
be
plausible,
but
the
state
would
be
bound
by
the
judgment
if
it
later
sues
on
the
debt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--tell
me
how
bankruptcy
works.
is
the
united
states
trustee
potentially
part
of
any
proceeding
that
the
trustee
wants
to
be
involved
in?
can
the
trustee
have
come
into
this
proceeding
voluntarily
if...
if
he
or
she
chose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
does
seem
that
if
an
action
is
brought
by
a
u.s.
trustee,
that's
an
officer...
that's
the
federal
government.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
which
is
another
way
of
solving
this
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
voidable
preference
case,
it's...
it's
as
if
we're...
the
suggestion
is
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
has
the
authority
to
order
the
res
brought
before
it,
commanding
the
state
to
deliver
the
res,
i.e.,
the
voidable
preference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
please.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
right.
