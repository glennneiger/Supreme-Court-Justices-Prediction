well,
let's
talk
a
little
bit
about
the
notion
that's
raised
in
one
or
more
of
the
amicus
briefs,
that
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
is
akin
to
an
in
rem
proceeding
or
is
an
in
rem
proceeding,
such
as
might
be
the
case
in
an
admiralty
suit
where
we
would
think
the
state
would
be
bound.
now,
would
you
address
that
argument,
which
i
found
possibly
persuasive?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
doesn't
it
fit
in
the
bankruptcy
context
too
where
the
debtor's
assets
are
assembled
in
kind
of
an
in
rem
proceeding
and
the
creditors
share
in
it?
it
could
have
very
unfortunate
consequences
certainly
if...
if
your
position
were
upheld.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
read
your
position
to
be
that
the
state
isn't
bound
at
all,
for
instance,
that
the
bankruptcy
court
cannot
discharge
property
liens
held
by
the
state.
i
mean,
i...
i
read
your
position
as
being
that
the
state
cannot
be
forced
into
any
aspect
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess...
i
guess
the...
you
would
say
the
state
doesn't
have
to
abide
by
the
automatic
stay.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if...
if
we
were
to
analogize
bankruptcy
proceedings
to
in
rem
proceedings
in
general,
nevertheless
this
dischargeability
proceeding
is
set
up
under
the
rules
as
an
adversary
one
where
a
notice
and
a
summons
is
filed
on
the
state.
that's
a
product
of
how
the
rules
are
constructed.
now,
presumably
in
time
they
could
be
changed,
but
what
about
this
case?
