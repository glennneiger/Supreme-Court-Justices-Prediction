justice
antonin
scalia
moreover,
the...
the
fact
that
this
proceeding
had
to
be
brought
against
the
state
was
purely
a
result
of
congressional
disposition.
congress
could
have
treated
these
debts
to
the
state
like
all
other
debts,
in
which
case
they
would
have
been
automatically
discharged.
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so
that
the...
the
argument
that
the
bankruptcy...
the
in
rem
nature
of
the
bankruptcy
procedure
gives...
gives
her
all
the
protection
that
the
constitution
at
least
requires,
vis-a-vis
the
state,
it
seems
to
me
is
a
strong
one.
it's
only
because
of
the
statute
that...
that
this
action
had
to
be
brought.
if
congress
really
wants
to
discharge
her
from
debts
to
the
state,
it
could
have
done
so
by
simply
treating
the
state
like
all
other
debtors.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you...
you
would
have
no
problem
with
congress'
amending
this
statute
so
that
it
reads
if
the
state
chooses
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity,
the
debtor
has
to
proceed
in
this
manner.
however,
if
the
state
refuses
to
waive
its
sovereign
immunity
by
appearing
in
the
proceeding,
the
debt
will
be
automatically
discharged.
you...
you
would
have
no
problem
with
that,
i
take
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
i
thought
you
accepted
that
a
moment
ago.
i
thought
you
accepted
a
moment
ago
that
congress
didn't
have
to
provide
this
special
treatment
of
the
states
at
all.
if
congress
didn't
have
to
provide
it
at
all,
certainly
congress
could
say
if
the
state
chooses
not
to...
not
to
take
it,
not
to
appear
in
the
proceeding,
we'll
dispense
with
it.
i...
it
seems
to
me
the
greater
includes
the
lesser.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute...
the
statute
doesn't...
doesn't
require,
does
it,
that
that
preferred
position
be
established
in
an
adversary
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
suppose
you're
saying
this
is
an
adversary
proceeding.
regardless
of
whether--
justice
antonin
scalia
--regardless
of
how...
how
it
got
to
be
so,
whether
it
got
to
be
so
through
rule
or
through
anything
else,
it's
an
adversary
proceeding
and
the
state
cannot
be
hailed
in
in
this
fashion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
happens
when
you
don't
show
up
in
an
adversary
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
default
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
how
can
you
say...
i
mean,
had
it
not
been
set
up
this
way,
i
would
assume
that
the
bankruptcy
judge
would
have
to
make
his
or
her
own
determination
about
whether
the
condition
of
the
statute
had
been
met,
but
once
you
have
this
adversary
system
set
up,
i
assume
the
bankruptcy
judge
is
entirely
within
his
or
her
rights
by
just
saying,
hey,
the
state
hasn't
shown
up,
the
state
loses.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that...
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
elevating
form
over
substance.
that...
that's
a
big
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
other
adversary
proceedings
that
work
that
way?
i
mean,
i
suppose
that
depends
on
what
the...
what
the
rule
means,
but
when
the
rule
describes
it
as
an
adversary
proceeding,
i...
i
would
take
it
to
mean
that
if
the
other
side
doesn't
show
up,
it
loses.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is...
is
the
amount
at
issue
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the...
but
the...
the
amount,
how
much
it
is,
is
not...
is
not
in
controversy,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--excuse
me.
i
didn't
understand
that
answer.
it
would
not
be
a
default
judgment.
it
would
be
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
is
there
a
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
default
judgments
are,
for
all
purposes,
considered
judgments
on
the
merits.
for
what
purpose
is
a
default
judgment
not
a
judgment
on
the
merits?
justice
scalia
you...
you
could
say
the
same
about
any
default
judgment
in
a
case...
in
a
tort
action
where
the
tort
statute,
you
know,
only
imposes
liability
where
the
defendant
has
been
negligent.
the
defendant
doesn't
show
up.
the
court
doesn't...
doesn't
enter
into
its
own
independent
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
defendant
was
negligent.
it
enters
default
judgment.
and
the
statute,
just
as
clearly,
requires
negligence
there
as
this
statute
requires
undue
hardship
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
loss
of
its
right
automatic?
what
is
your
answer
to
the
question
of
whether,
if
you
don't
show
up,
a
default
judgment
is
entered
automatically
against
you,
or
does
the
bankruptcy
judge
have
to
make
the
assessment
of
whether
there's
an
undue
hardship?
