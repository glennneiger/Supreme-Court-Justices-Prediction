justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
i
don't
understand
what
the
statute
has...
how
the
statute
is
involved
in
this.
i
mean,
the
statute
just
sets
a
standard
for
discharging
a...
a
student
who
has
an
educational
loan.
it
says
it
has
to
be
undue
hardship.
what's
wrong
with
that?
i
mean,
why
can't...
there
are
dozens
of
statutes...
dozens
of
statutes
that
say...
i
guess
dozens.
i'm
not
a
bankruptcy
expert,
but
statutes
that
say
you
get
this
kind
of
a
discharge
if
there
hasn't
been
a
fraudulent
conveyance,
but
if
there
has
been,
you
don't
get
it,
and
if
it's
this,
you
don't
get
it,
and
if
it's
that,
you
do
get
it.
all
these
may
involve
debts
owed
to
or...
the
state.
are...
are
you
saying...
what
has
the
statute
to
do
with
this?
the
statute
just
sets
a
standard
for
getting
a
discharge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
let's
assume
it's
unique.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
it
in
the
constitution
or
the
eleventh
amendment
that
says
congress
cannot
set
a
special
standard
for
discharging
a
bankrupt
from
a
certain
kind
of
debt?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
in...
what
in
the
constitution
says
that
if
that
kind
of
debt
happens
to
be
one
that
is
owed
to
the
state,
congress
is
forbidden
to
do
that?
i
don't...
i
just
don't
understand
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
and
so
why
is
the
state,
if
it
happens
to
be
owed
that
kind
of
money,
in
any
sort
of
a
different
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
then
what
you're
quarreling
with
is,
of
course,
not
the
statute.
you
are
quarreling,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out,
with
a
bankruptcy
rule
that
happen
to
use
the
word
adversary
proceeding.
but
suppose
the
rulemakers
had
simply
said,
this
need
not
be
done
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
it
can
be
done
in
exactly
the
same
kind
of
proceeding
as
discharging
any
other
kind
of
debt.
i,
the
bankruptcy
judge,
will
follow
the
congressional
mandate
as
to
when
it
is
discharged.
you
will
notify
all
debtors,
mr.
bankrupt,
including
the
state,
and
if
they
want
to
come
in
and
protest
it,
they
can.
now,
why...
what
would
be
unconstitutional
about
such
a
provision
that
never
uses
the
word
adversary
proceeding?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
did
i.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
rather
like
to
get
the
answer
to
the
question
which
is
i
understand
what
position
you
took
in
the
brief.
i
want
to
know
why.
i
want
to
know
what
the
logic
is.
i
can't
find
anything
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
congress
cannot
impose
the
same
standard
in
respect
to
discharging
a
debt
owed
to
the
state
as
it
applies
to
a
debt
owed
to
anybody
else.
now,
either
you
agree
with
that
proposition
or
you
don't.
and
if
you
don't...
and
i
think
you
don't...
i'd
like
to
know
what
the
theory
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
once
you
agree
with
the
proposition,
then
all
your
objecting
to
is
the
word
adversary
in
the
word
adversary
proceeding,
and
it
takes
3
minutes
or
less
for
a
good
expert
simply
to
get
rid
of
that
adversary
proceeding
and
have
the
same
thing
done
in
an
ordinary
proceeding.
now,
i
want
to
know
the
answer
to
what
i
say,
not
that
you
disagree
with
it.
i
know
you
disagree
with
it.
i
want
to
know
why
you
disagree
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
there
is
a
dispute
about
whether
you
could,
in
fact,
call
this
kind
of
adversary
proceeding,
given
the
underlying
standard
that
all
it
is
is
a
way
of
getting
to
the
same
result,
really
not
an
adversary
proceeding
for
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
since
it
has
no
functional
difference
whatsoever
from
a
proceeding
that
isn't
labeled
adversary
but
simply
gives
the
state
notice
of
what's
going
on
and
permits
the
state
to
come
in,
just
as
if
it
worked,
which
is
ordinary
proceedings.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
a
good
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--now,
what
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
state
lacked?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
state
lacked?
justice
breyer
the
supreme
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
what
is
the
situation
there?
i
mean,
i
don't
want
you
just
to
drop
this.
that
is,
is
an
adversary
proceeding
under
the
bankruptcy
code...
and
there
are
quite
a
few.
you've
said
two
opposite
things
now.
your
first
time
you
said,
well,
if
the
other
party
doesn't
show
up,
the
bankruptcy
judge
can
just
say,
debtor,
you
win.
okay?
without
looking
at
the
merits.
and
the
second
time
you
said,
no,
that's
not
really
so.
the
bankruptcy
judge
has
to
satisfy
himself
that
the
statutory
standard
is
met.
now,
i
guess
this
isn't
the
only
place
where
there's
a
adversary
proceeding
in
the
code.
so
which
is
it?
is
it
like
an...
and
how
do
i
find
out?
if
you're
uncertain,
what
do
i
look
up
to
try
to
find
out
the
answer
to
that
question?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
see--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
i
got
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
maybe
there
are
no
others.
are
there...
are
there
any
adversary
proceedings,
other
than
this,
one
which
isn't
like
what
you
just
described?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
trying
to
get...
i'm
trying
to
get
the
answer
still
to
justice
scalia's
question.
take
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked.
it's
a
preference
action.
it's
a
kind
of
bankruptcy
action.
it's
in
an
adversary
proceeding.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
the
other
side
doesn't
show
up.
okay,
forget
this
eleventh
amendment
business.
i
just
want
to
know
the
normal
thing
in
bankruptcy.
what's
the
answer?
if
he
doesn't
show
up,
is
he
defaulted
like
a
regular
case
outside
the
court,
or
does
the
trustee...
i
mean,
does
the
judge,
the
bankruptcy
judge,
look
at
the
matter
and
make
up
his
own
mind
independently
about
whether
it
was
a
preference
or
not?
how
does
it
work
in
bankruptcy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
one
other
technical
question.
suppose
we
were
to
say--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
in
fact
we
assume...
let's
suppose
when
we
look
into
this...
suppose
i
was
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
an
adversary
proceeding
in
bankruptcy
is
identical
to
a
case
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
bankruptcy
in
a
court.
you
say
isn't,
and
maybe
that's
so
and
we'll
find
out.
all
right.
now,
if
that
were
so
and
if
that
meant
under
the
court's
case
law
that
this
particular
adversary
proceeding
were
invalid
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
would
the
bankruptcy
judge
under
section
105
or
some
other
section
or
would
the
rules
committee
have
the
power
without
going
back
to
congress
to
devise
a
different
procedure
that
would
get
to
exactly
the
same
place,
say,
a
procedure
that
had
the
bankruptcy
judge
adjudicate
this
under
the
same
standard
while
notifying
the
state,
like
any
other
creditor,
that
it
could
intervene
at
is
choice.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
even
without
105,
could
the
rules
committee
then
devise
a
different
rule?
