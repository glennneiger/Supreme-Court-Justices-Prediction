we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
82...
rather,
02-1606,
tennessee
student
assistance
corporation
v.
pamela
hood.
mr.
brand.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
happened
here
was
something
where...
where
a
summons
was
issued
to
the
state,
wasn't
it?
it
was...
the
state
didn't
just
remain
outside
and
do
nothing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
the
gardner
case,
isn't
it?
the--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
brand.
mr.
gerson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
in
that
case
the
state
had
come
into
bankruptcy...
the
bankruptcy
court
voluntarily.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
wouldn't
just
go
by
default
then
if
the
state
didn't
show
up?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
a...
in
a...
in
an
ordinary
suit
for
money
judgment,
if
the
defendant
fails
to
show
up,
he
can
be
defaulted
as
to
liability,
but
he
still
has
to
show
the
money
damages.
he
just
doesn't
get
the
amount
that
he
says
in
his
complaint.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
an
action
by
a
trustee
for...
of
voidable
preference
would
be
quite
different,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
there
you're
getting
money
from
outside
the
estate
too.
you're
getting
a
money
judgment
against
somebody
that
would
increase
the
assets
of
the
estate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would...
you
would
say
that
if
the...
if
there
were
a
suit
for
a
voidable
preference
against
the
state,
the
11th
amendment
rule
would
prevail?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
before
the
bankruptcy
act
in
1978,
bankruptcy
courts
couldn't
try
voidable
preferences.
that
had
to
be
in
the
district
court
i
believe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gerson.
mr.
brand,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
briefly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank...
thank
you,
mr.
brand.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
02-1606,
tennessee
student
assistance
corporation
versus
hood.
the
respondent
here,
pamela
hood
signed
promissory
notes
for
educational
loans
guaranteed
by
the
petitioner,
the
tennessee
student
assistance
corporation,
tsac
for
short,
a
governmental
corporation.
later,
she
filed
a
no-asset
chapter
7
bankruptcy
petition
in
the
united
states
bankruptcy
court
in
tennessee.
she
was
granted
a
general
discharge.
hood
did
not
list
her
student
loans
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
thus,
under
the
bankruptcy
code,
the
general
discharge
did
not
cover
them.
hood
later
reopened
her
bankruptcy
petition
for
the
limited
purpose
of
seeking
a
determination
by
the
bankruptcy
court
that
her
student
loans
were
dischargeable
as
an
undo
hardship
pursuant
to
provision
of
federal
law.
as
prescribed
by
the
rules
of
bankruptcy
procedure,
hood
filed
an
adversary
proceeding
which
was
commenced
by
the
service
of
a
complaint
and
a
summons
of
tsac.
in
response,
tsac
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
asserting
eleventh
amendment
sovereign
immunity.
the
bankruptcy
court
denied
the
motion
holding
that
section
106
act
was
okay.
the
bankruptcy
appellate
panel
of
the
sixth
circuit
of
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
sixth
circuit
affirmed
on
substantially
the
same
grounds.
we
granted
certiorari
and
now
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
but
on
different
grounds.
although
the
eleventh
amendment
generally
precludes
private
suits
against
unconsenting
states,
states
are
not
immune
from
all
judicial
actions.
our
cases
indicate
that
at
least
where
the
bankruptcy
court’s
jurisdiction
over
the
reese
is
unquestioned,
the
exercise
of
its
in
rem
jurisdiction
to
discharge
a
debt
does
not
infringue
state
sovereignty
that
student
loan
debt
is
presumably
non-dischargeable
and
requires
an
individualized
adjudication,
it
does
not
alter
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
indeed,
we
have
previously
endorsed
individualized
determination
of
state’s
interest
within
the
federal
courts
in
rem
jurisdiction,
as
the
undo
hardship
determination
sought
by
hood,
in
this
case,
falls
within
the
bankruptcy
court’s
in
rem
jurisdiction.
we
hold
it
is
not
a
suit
against
the
state
for
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
so,
even
if
we
were
to
hold
that
congress
lacked
the
power
to
abrogate
state
sovereign
immunity
under
the
bankruptcy
clause
as
tsac
urges
us
to
do,
the
bankruptcy
court
would
still
have
the
authority
to
make
the
undo
hardship
determination
sought
by
hood.
we
therefore,
decline
to
decide
whether
a
bankruptcy
court’s
exercise
of
personal
jurisdiction
over
a
state
would
be
valid
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
justice
souter
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
ginsburg
has
joined;
justice
thomas
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
scalia
has
joined.
