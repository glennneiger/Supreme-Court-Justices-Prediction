mr.
edward
l.
marshall
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
squarely
controlled
by
the
court's
opinions
in
graham
v.
collins
and
johnson
v.
texas
in
which
the
court
rejected
penry
claims
based
on
youth
and
troubled
upbringing.
in
fact,
tennard's
penry
claim,
based
on
a
completely
unexplained
iq
score,
is
much
weaker
than
graham's
or
johnson's
for
two
reasons.
first,
tennard's
claim
is
governed
by
the
aedpa,
which
requires
deference
to
the
texas
court's
reasoning
in
its
opinion,
and
second,
tennard's
disembodied
iq
score
has
really
minimal
mitigating
or
aggravating
significance
within
the
special
issues
here
because--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--your
honor,
i...
i
believe
it
was
given
proper
consideration.
whether
it
was
considered
as--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--it
is
apart
from
that
question,
justice
kennedy.
however,
in
this
case,
if
you
take
a
look
at
counsel's
strategy
as
a
whole
in...
in
defending
this
case,
he
basically
decided
to
paint
tennard
as
the
less
culpable
party
among
his
co-defendants
and...
and
paint
him
as
a
follower
in
illustrating
that
he
allowed
his
prior
rape
victim
to
escape.
in...
in
questioning
his
role
in
the
murders
in
this
case,
that
was
his
strategy.
counsel
certainly
didn't
believe,
i...
i
don't
think
from
the
record,
that...
that
this
iq
score
had
any
independent
mitigating
significance
beyond
that
follower
theory
because
he
didn't
object
to
the...
the
instructions
or
the
special
issues
that
were
given
and...
and
didn't
attempt
to
argue
it
outside
of
that
context.
everything
that
he
placed
before
the
jury
was
the
idea
that
tennard
was
a
follower
in
this
case
and
that
that
made
him
less
culpable.
and
that
is
a
fact
that
is
mitigating
within
the
context
of
future
dangerousness,
as
this
court
reasoned
in
jurek,
where
they
said
the
duress
or
domination
of
co-defendants
would
be
cognizable
within
that
special
issue.
here,
counsel
presented
the
argument
and...
and
some
evidence
to
the
effect
that
tennard
was
a
model
prisoner
when
he
was
incarcerated
in
his
prior...
for
the
prior
rape
conviction.
he
had
no
disciplinary
infractions.
this
was
clearly
counsel's
global
theory,
not
that
he
was...
that
he
had
any
kind
of
diminished
capacity
to
commit
this
offense.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
justice
scalia,
i...
i
would
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
really
looking
at
whether
the
state
court's
opinion
was
reasonable
in
this
case.
the...
the
state
court
did
apply
penry
in
a
way
to
try
to
determine...
applied
johnson
and
graham
and
tried
to
determine
whether
this
evidence
was
relevant
within
the
special
issues
as
given
and
as
defined.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
they
are
one
proper
interpretation.
they
were
developed
as
a
screening
test
of
sorts
to
try
to
engender
some
sort
of
consistency
in
the
many,
many,
many
penry
claims
that
they--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--that
would
be
one
argument
we
would
advance,
justice
o'connor.
i...
that's
sort
of
a
screening,
a...
a
prima
facie
analysis
of...
of
the
penry
claim
and
it's
designed
to
handle
a
wide
variety
of
types
of
evidence
offered.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
we
know
now
that
it's
a
low
iq.
i...
i
don't
know
whether
the
jury
was
aware
of
that
fact
at
the
time
of
trial
because
it
was
never
explained
to
them,
your
honor.
and
it
was
never
contrasted
with
any
other
iq
score.
however,
i
think
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
is
illustrative
of...
of
the
difference
between
the...
the
four-part
test
that's
identified
in
the
fifth
circuit
for
determining
penry
violations
and
the
additional
analysis
that
goes
on
top
of
it,
which
is
even
aside
from
this
question
of
whether
we
have
a
nexus,
whether
we
have
a...
whether
we
have
severity
or
permanence,
these
other
factors,
the
court
invariably
ends
up
looking
at
whether
the
jury
could
consider
that
evidence
within
the
special
issues,
whether
it
was
relevant
in...
in
some
way,
in
some
meaningful
way.
and...
and
that's
the
question
the
court
identified
in
johnson
and
in
graham
that...
that
should
be...
be
the
controlling
factor
in
penry
cases.
so
i
think...
i
think
the
eighth
amendment
only
requires
looking
at
johnson
and
graham,
that...
that
the
jury
be
able
to
give
effect
in
some
manner
to
the
evidence
introduced,
not
that
it
be
able...
not
that
it's
required
to
give
effect
in
every
conceivable
way.
and
so
the
issue
isn't
really
whether
tennard
can
identify
some
relevance
for
this
evidence
beyond
the
special
issues
that
were
given,
but
whether
he
can...
whether
we
can
look
at
the
record
and
see
if
it
had
some
relevance
within
those
special
issues
that
was
available
to
the
jury.
and
i
think
that's
exactly
what
the
state
court
did
in
this
case.
they
looked
at
deliberateness
and
as
tennard
has
argued
in
his
brief,
i
think
quite
eloquently,
deliberateness
was
truly
designed
to
deal
with
the
question
of
party
liability.
whether
the
defendant
had
a
reasonable
expectation
that
death
would
occur.
and
in
this
case,
where
a
party
instruction
was
given
during
the
guilt/innocence
phase,
there
was
that
lingering
question
of
whether
tennard
was
the
primary
actor
here.
and
so
that's
exactly
how
tennard's
counsel
argued
it
to
the
jury.
he
suggested
that...
that
tennard
was
a
follower.
he
wasn't
the
primary
here.
he
may
not
have
even
stabbed
the
victim
in
this
case.
it
might
have
been
his
co-defendant
who
may
be
lying
or...
or
minimizing
their
own
responsibility
in
order
to
cover
their
tracks.
and
so
that's
the
theory
before
the
jury
from
counsel's
perspective,
and
that
fits
squarely
within
deliberateness
here.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
justice
souter,
that
is
not
a
question
of
admissibility,
though.
and...
and
here
what
the
court
was
looking
at
on
appeal--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--your
honor,
it's...
it's
a
combination
question
that
we're
looking
at
here.
it's
whether
the
evidence
had...
had
mitigating
significance
and
then
whether
that
significance
was
beyond
the
scope
of
the
special
issues.
i
think
that--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--your
honor,
that
may
be
true.
however--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--i...
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the
uniquely
severe,
permanent
handicap
test
that
was
identified
in...
in
the
fifth
circuit's
en
banc
opinion
in
graham
is
basically
a
description
of
penry's
evidence.
and
so
the
question
is--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--no,
your
honor.
the
fifth
circuit's
test
is
not
even
at
issue
in
this
case.
it
was
at
issue
in
the
companion
case
smith,
but
here
what
we're
looking
at
in
the
denial
of
coa
context
under
the
aedpa
is
whether
the
state
court's
treatment
of
the
issue
was
reasonable
or
not.
and
i
think--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--not
quite,
your
honor.
the...
the
state
court
has
taken
a
slightly
different
tack.
they
did
not
address
the
nexus,
severity,
uniquely
severe
test
when
they
addressed
tennard's
evidence
in
this
case
in
ex
parte
tennard,
as
contained
in
the
joint
appendix.
they
did
not
apply
that
test.
and
in
the
past,
they
have
taken
different
approaches
over
nexus,
for
example.
the...
the
state
court
has
always
held
that
nexus
is
established
automatically
if
a
defendant
introduces
evidence
of
mental
retardation,
and
they
have
granted
relief
in
numerous
cases
on
that
very
point,
that
there's
several
cases
in
my
brief
at
pages
27
and
28
that
i've
identified
where
the...
i
think
there
are
six
or
seven...
where
the
state
court
granted
relief
saying
that
we
know
mental
retardation
is
uniquely
severe
because
not
only,
as
it
was
described
in
penry,
but...
but
in
earlier
cases,
that...
that
it
affects
the
defendant's
ability
to
control
their
impulses,
it
affects
their
ability
to
learn
from
their
mistakes.
these
are
the
things
that
are
mitigating
and
these
have
an
automatic
nexus.
so
there's
a
difference
between
the
way
the
fifth
circuit
has
applied
it
and
the
way
the
state
court
has
applied
it,
and
i
don't--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--your
honor,
the
state
court
initially
began
by
asking...
by
identifying
more
or
less
four
factors,
whether
the...
whether
the
evidence
was
involuntary
disability,
whether
it
was
permanent
in
nature,
whether
it
was
severe
enough,
and
whether
there
was
at
least
an
inference
of
nexus
from
the
evidence.
those
four
factors
parallel,
more
or
less,
the
uniquely
severe,
permanent
handicap
language
from
graham.
and
so
the
two
tests
have
gone
in
parallel
through
the
years,
although
the
state
court
has
vindicated
many
more
penry
claims
than
the
fifth
circuit
has
simply
because
that's
where
the
meritorious
claims
were
found
and
that's
where
they
got
relief.
so
the
fifth
circuit
has
never
been
faced
with
the
number
of
cases
that
the
state
court
was
that
presented
evidence
that
rose
to
that
level
so
that
i
think
in
retrospect,
the
fifth
circuit's
test
becomes
a
little
bit
severe
when
it
is
viewed
in
that
vacuum
but
when
it's
compared
with
the
way
the
state
court
has
done
it,
basically
all
of
the
meritorious
claims
have
been
vindicated.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that
is
correct.
however,
the
nexus
requirement
has
been
applied
differently
by
the
state
court.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that
is
a
fair
statement
of
it,
justice
souter.
it's...
it's
whether
the
jury
could
infer
a
connection.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
i
think
that's
the
brief
in
smith,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
justice
breyer,
the...
the
evidence
is
an
interesting
contrast
between
the
two
cases.
smith
introduced
more
than
abundant
evidence,
i
think,
of...
of...
that
were...
that
was
mitigating,
in
effect,
the
fact
that
he
had
an
antisocial
personality
disorder,
all
of
these
other
factors.
tennard's
iq
evidence
came
in
on
a
prison
record
form
with
just
a
sole
number
67.
the...
the
parole
officer
who
testified
identified
the
number
and
then
admitted
on
cross
that
he
had
no
idea
who
had
given
the
test,
he
had
no
idea
what
kind
of
test
was
given,
when
it
was
given.
all
of
these
factors
were...
were
laid
out
there.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
was
recognized
as
an
iq
test.
and...
i...
my
point
was
that
it
wasn't
identified
as
a
short-form
test,
a
full-scale
iq
score.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
your
honor,
it
was
not
contained
on
the...
the
social
and
criminal
history
form
that
was
introduce,
and
that's
at
page
63
of
the
joint
appendix.
it...
it's...
it's
not
in
that
form.
and
the
parole
officer
who
was
called
as
a
witness
by
the
defense
who
brought
this
form
didn't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
either.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
presumably
someone
would
know.
the
psychologist
who
administered
the
test
would
know.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that's
possible,
your
honor,
except
that
it
was
the
defendant's
evidence
in
this
case.
and
i
don't
think
that
the
state
necessarily
looked
at
it
as
any
significant
evidence,
just
like
i
don't
think
the
defense
looked
at
it
as
significant
evidence.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
justice
souter,
under...
under
both
graham
and
johnson,
we're
trying
to
figure
out
whether
the
evidence
had
some
relevance
within
the
special
issues,
not
whether
it
had
every
bit
of
relevance
it
should
have
had,
but
whether
it
just
had
some
meaningful
relevance.
and
so
i
think
looking
at
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
part
of
that
analysis.
we
have
to
look
and
see
what
the
jury
would
have...
what
meaning
the
jury
would
have
given--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
your
honor,
those
threshold--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--i
believe
that
is
the
issue,
and
i
might
add
that
those
threshold
requirements
are
questions
as
to
what
relevance
the
evidence
had
and
how
it
could
have
fit
within
the
special
issues.
so
when
we're
looking
at
severity
and
nexus,
we're
looking
at
how
does
the
evidence
mitigate
moral
culpability,
how
does
it
tend
to
excuse
the
crime.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
generally
speaking,
justice
souter,
the
evidence
that
fails
to
pass
that
test
does
have
some
relevance
within
the
special
issues
because,
generally
speaking,
it
tends
to
either
show
that
the
crime
was
an
aberration...
what
we're
looking
for
is
something
that's...
when
we're
trying
to
identify
penry
error,
we're
looking
at
evidence
that's
solely
aggravating
in
answering
those
special
issues,
not
necessarily
evidence
that
just
has
some
relevance
outside
those
special
issues,
just
whether
it
has
only
aggravating
relevance
within
them
or
no
relevance
within
them.
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
talking
about
in
graham
and
johnson,
where
we
looked
at
youth
and...
and
determined
that,
yes,
youth
had...
may
have
some
significance
outside
future
dangerousness,
but
the
fact
that
it
has
some
significance
within
future
dangerousness
cures
any
potential
penry
error.
and
that's
exactly
what
these
factors
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
identified,
and
the
state
court
to
a
lesser
extent,
are
designed
to
root
out,
to
try
to
catch
those
types
of
evidence
and
determine
whether
they
indeed
had
some
relevance
or
not.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
that's
correct.
the...
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
correct,
your
honor.
this
case...
the
fifth
circuit
looked
at
the
state
court
adjudication--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--well,
your
honor,
contrary...
i
mean,
and
in
contrast
to
penry
and
the
prior
cases
that
came
before
the
court,
this
is
not
here
on
de
novo
review.
we're
now
bound
by
the
aedpa,
and
we're
looking
at
reasonableness.
and
so
i
think
the
court
is
necessarily
looking
at
it
from
a
different
angle
now,
and...
and
so
whether
the
court
simply
disagrees
with
the
test
is
not
an
issue
here
and
really
wouldn't
be
merited--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--your
honor,
i
think
that
again,
if
the
court
disagrees
with
the
test
that
was
applied
in
the
fifth
circuit,
the
court
is
still
stuck
with...
with
determining
whether
it
was
the
state
court's
opinion
that
was
reasonable
or
not.
now,
the
court
could
await
another
case
raising
the
issue
and
there
are
more.
by
my
last
count
there
are
approximately
100
and
may
still...
on
death
row
in
texas
who
were
sentenced
under
this
sentencing
scheme,
and
so
i'm
sure
those
claims
will
arrive
again
some
day.
but...
but
in
this
case,
i
don't
think
the
court
has
that
option
when
applying
the
aedpa
to
the
state
court's
opinion.
and
further,
i...
i
think
what
we're
really
looking
at
is
whether
the
fifth
circuit's...
or...
or
whether
the...
the
federal
court's
application
of
the
aedpa
was
debatable.
so
we're
even
one
step
further
removed
from
reasonableness
in
that
sense.
i
don't
think
that
this
is
the
case
for
it,
and--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--generally
speaking,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
we're...
in
trying
to...
in
trying
to
analyze
the...
the
penry
claim,
we're
trying
to
figure
out
whether...
whether
the
evidence
introduced
at
trial
had...
had
significant
relevance
to
moral
culpability
that
was
outside
the
scope
of
the
special
issues.
and
i
think
it's
the
combination
of
those
factors,
not
necessarily
each
one,
one
by
one,
that
gets
you
there,
but
the
nexus
requirement
basically
just
asks
the
question
whether
it
actually
has
relevance
to
moral
culpability
and
whether
that
relevance
reaches
the
level
that
it
placed
it
outside
the
special
issues.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
well,
for
example,
justice
scalia,
i...
i
think
that
the
evidence
of
follower
status,
for
example,
that...
that
was
argued
extensively
to
the
jury
in
this
case
would
have
a
nexus
to
the
crime
because,
of
course,
it
involved
the
circumstances
of
the
crime.
and
so,
therefore,
it
would
fall
within
the
special
issue
of
deliberateness
where
the
jury
is
asked
to
resolve
the
issue
of...
of
the
specific
intent
required
in
a
party
situation
like
this.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
well,
then
i
think--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--well,
then
i
would
question
whether
the
evidence
actually
had
relevance
to
moral
culpability
if
it
had
no
connection
to
the
defendant
or
his
crime.
and
so
i
think
that's
the
inquiry
we're
looking
at
there,
is...
is...
and
again,
it's
part
of
the...
the
multi-part
test
that
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
state
court
have
devised.
and
i
think
the
best
explanation
occurs
in...
in
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
in
robertson
v.
cockrell
which
was
handed
down
last
year.
it
was
an
en
banc
opinion
at
325
f.
3d
243.
the
court
summed
up
its
entire
body
of
penry
jurisprudence
there
and
identified
the
four
factors
that
are
relevant,
voluntariness
and
so
on.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
it...
it
requires
a
nexus,
at
least
an
inferential
nexus,
to
the
crime
itself,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
it
would
not,
but
it...
but...
but
again,
that
evidence
would
be
relevance
within
future
dangerousness
because
it
would
go
to
good
character.
so
while
good
character
evidence
doesn't
necessarily
have
a
nexus
to
the
crime,
good
character
evidence
is
relevant
within
the...
the
special
issues,
and
the
court
held
that
in
jurek
that--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--the
rule
is
not
that
strict,
justice
souter.
it...
it
requires
an
inference
of
causation.
and
i
think
child
abuse
is--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--i
think
child
abuse
is...
is
truly
analogous
to
youth,
for
example,
which
i
think
the
average
juror
does
understand
has
a
connection
to
moral
culpability.
and
it's...
as
youth
is
something
that
most
people
have
common--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--no,
you're
not
wrong,
justice
souter.
i...
i
think
that
is--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--if
child
abuse
was
the
evidence
presented
in
this
case,
we
may
have
a
bigger
problem,
your
honor.
that
is
a
more
difficult
topic.
however,
it's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
it
is,
of
course.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
i
don't
think
that's
absolute,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
there
may
be
some
causation
argument
where
we're
looking
at,
as
i
said,
common
knowledge.
jurors...
jurors
know
that
people
who
are
abused
as
children
turn
out
a
certain
way
and...
and
that
it's--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--your
honor,
i...
i'm
not
aware
of
cases
that...
that
they
excluded
evidence
of
severe
child
abuse.
however,
in
some
cases
where
there
was
mild
or
moderate,
sketchy
evidence
of
child
abuse,
they
have
used
that--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
i--
mr.
edward
l.
marshall
--your
honor,
i
think
in
robertson,
the
most
recent
case
in
which
the
court
took
up
the
issue
of
child
abuse...
and
i
see
my
red
light
is
on,
but
i'll
finish
answering.
