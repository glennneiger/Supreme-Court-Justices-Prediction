justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
i
understand
that
the...
that
the
specific
issue
that
we've
got
here,
assuming
we...
we
do
reach
the...
the
merits
issue
as
part
of
the
coa
problem,
is
the
specific
circuit
rule
that
there
has
got
to
be
a
finding
of,
as
i
recall,
unique
severity
and
a
finding
of
causation.
and
as
i
understand
what
the
circuit
said
was,
because
those
conditions
were
not
satisfied,
we
ultimately
do
not
even
reach
the
kind
of
penry
issue
that...
that
you
described
as
being
in
the
background.
is...
is
that
a
fair
statement
of
what
we've
got
in
front
of
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
by
the
same
token,
wouldn't
it
be
fair
for
the
judge
to
say,
no
reasonable
jury,
possessed
of
reasonable,
human
sympathy,
could
possibly
find
this
mitigating?
the
bad
cold
could
be
kept
out
and
there
would
be
no
constitutional
error.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
you're...
you're
worried
about
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
could
i...
can
i...
can
i
interrupt
you
there?
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the...
let's
take
the
first
prong
of
the
first
circuit's
test,
the
unique
severity
requirement,
that
in
fact,
if
the
unique
severity
requirement
is
a
proper
reading
of...
of
penry,
then
it
seems
to
me
we've
read
that
evidence,
in
effect,
right
out
of...
of
relevance
and
admissibility.
there
are
millions
of
followers
in
this
world.
there's
no
way
in
the
world,
i
would
suppose,
on
this
evidence
that...
that
one
could
plausibly
argue
that
this
individual's
condition
was
a
uniquely
severe
follower
kind
of
personality,
and
therefore
it
would
be
excluded.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
the
unique
severity
requirement
would
preclude
the
argument
you
just
made
in
support
of
the...
the
court's
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it...
it...
as
your
brother
on
the
other
side
said,
if
it's
constitutional
relevance,
it
could
be
a
basis
for
an
admissibility
ruling.
but
let's,
as
you
say,
take
the
case
that
we've
got
and...
and
on
the
case
that
we've
got,
the...
in
effect,
the
court
is
saying
there's
no
need
even
to
get
to
the
argument
that
counsel
for
the
state
of
texas
has
just
made
because
on...
on
no
reading
of
uniquely
severe
could
we
say
that
this
is
uniquely
severe
evidence.
and
therefore,
we
don't
even
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
sufficient
consideration
could
have
been
given
to
this
under...
under
penry.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
say...
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
circuit
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
says
we
don't
even
have
to
deal
with
the
substance
of
these
issues
unless
the
evidence
is
indicative
of
something
which
is
uniquely
severe,
which
clearly
this
is
not.
so
that
on
the...
as
i
understand
the
circuit's
position,
there
would
be
no
need
for
you
to
make
the
argument
that
you
just
made
to
us
about
the
adequacy
of
consideration
that
could
be
given
under...
under
penry
because
on
the
uniquely
severe
test,
we
don't
even...
it's
not
uniquely
severe
under
any
reading
and
therefore
we
don't
even
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
substance.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
it's
true,
it's
a
violation
of
penry,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
the
same
test,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
it
has
not
been
applied
as
a
causation
test.
is
that
it?
association
but
not
causation?
is
that
a
fair--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
all
of
this
goes
to
the
weight
that
the
evidence
might
have,
but
it...
what...
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
erect
this
threshold
test
for
considering
whether
it
even
needs
to
be
considered
as...
as
an
issue
on
appeal?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it...
it...
you...
you
don't...
i
take
it
your
argument
is
not
that
they
couldn't
give
it
any
weight
at
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the...
the...
what
i'm
going
to
call
the
screening
question
we
have
before
us
is
does
a
court
even
have
to
get
into
the
use
that
might
be
made
of
that
evidence,
whatever
its
weight,
unless
that
evidence
satisfies
these
two
threshold
requirements--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
the
state's
equivalent
of
the
two
threshold
requirements?
isn't
that
the
issue
before
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
the
circuit,
i
take
it,
would
say,
all
right,
given
the
fact
that
there
may
be
an
argument
over
the
weight
to
be
given,
accepting
that,
we
don't
have
to
decide
whether
enough
weight
could
be
given
to
that
evidence
for
penry
purposes
unless
that
evidence
indicates
something
that
is
uniquely
severe
and
was
the
cause
of
the
crime.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
what...
what
about
the...
the
case
of
the
individual
with
the...
with
the
abused
childhood?
assume...
assume
a
case...
i
think
one
of
the
briefs
mentioned
this.
assume
a
case
in
which
the
parents
didn't
teach
the
child
to
be
a
thief
or
a
murderer
or
to
commit
crimes.
they
simply
abused
the
child.
it's...
it's
clear
that...
from
our
cases
that
that
evidence
would
be
admissible.
what
i
don't
understand
is
how
that
evidence
could
ever
satisfy
the
nexus
test.
there's
no
way
you
can
say
as
a
causal
matter
that
the
fact
of
the
abusive
childhood
caused
this
crime,
which
i
take
it
is
what
the...
the
fifth
circuit
would
require.
am
i...
am
i
missing
something?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
mean,
that's...
that's
what
i
mean
by
cause.
how
could
you
ever
infer
causation?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
you're...
you're...
i...
i
don't
mean
to
be
short
with
you,
but
i
think
you're
changing
the
terms
of
the
question.
it
isn't
whether
there
is
an
association
with
moral
culpability.
the
issue,
as
i
understand
it,
is
whether
this
mitigating
evidence
is
relevant
to
this
crime
in
the
sense
that
there
is
a
possible
causal
inference,
not
some
broader
association.
am
i
wrong
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
then
how
can
you
draw
the
causal
inference?
why...
why
on
that...
on
that
threshold
relevance
understanding,
why...
why
ultimately
wouldn't
we
have
to
say,
well,
under
the
fifth
circuit
rule,
the
abused
childhood
evidence
really
is
irrelevant?
it
can
never
be
considered.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
utterly
inconsistent
with
our
cases,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
haven't...
isn't
it
perfectly
clear
that
that
evidence
is
admissible?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
must
be
given
we'll...
let's
use
the
term,
meaningful
consideration,
by
the
jury.
and...
and
it
couldn't
be
given
any
consideration
on
the
causation...
if
there's
a
causation
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
i...
i
guess
that
gets
us...
i
guess
the
difference
between
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
and
your
answer
to
me
gets...
gets
us
to
the
question,
what
do
they
mean
by
cause?
and...
and
i
thought
the
fifth
circuit
was
requiring
something
much
more
than,
as
you
put
it,
an
association
with
the
personality.
i
thought
it
was
requiring
something
more
specific.
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
suggests
that
i...
that
i
am
wrong,
that
the
circuit
isn't
requiring
what
i
thought
it
was.
