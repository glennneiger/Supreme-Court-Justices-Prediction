justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
as
long
as
we're
into
these
preliminary
matters...
and
then
i'll
let
you,
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
proceed
the
way
you
wish.
it
is
true
that
in
this
case,
isn't
it,
if...
if
we
say
there
should
be
a
coa,
the
fifth
circuit
is
just
going
to
follow
its...
its
earlier
panel
opinion,
and
i...
i
assume
it
must
on...
on
the
nexus
rule.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
you
saying
that
in...
in
most
states
under
lockett,
the
trial
judge
has
no
discretion
to
say
this
is
just
too
far
outside
the
bounds
of
what
mitigation
evidence
really
means?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
this...
this
is
not
a
case
of...
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
where
we're
seeing
if...
if
it
was
proper
to
overlook
the
evidence
at
all.
the
evidence
was
entered,
was
admitted
in
the
trial
court.
and
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
was
given
proper
consideration.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
mean,
that's...
that's
quite
apart
from
the
fact
that,
you
know,
it
may
be
persuasive
or
not
persuasive.
