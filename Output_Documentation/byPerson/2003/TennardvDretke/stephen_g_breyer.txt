justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
rather
mixed
up.
i
mean,
i'm
taking
your
brief
on
pages
10
through
12,
and
reading
your
account
of
it,
what
i
thought
happened
is
that
when
the
defendant,
who
had
been
sentenced
to
death,
went
to
the
district
court
and
then
to
the
fifth
circuit,
the
fifth
circuit
did
not
say,
just
as
justice
souter
said...
it
did
not
say
this
evidence
helps
to
show
this
person
will
not
commit
the
crime.
rather,
they
said,
when
faced
with
the
argument,
this
evidence
shows
he's
more
dangerous
because
a
mentally
retarded
person
at
this
level
might
commit
more
crimes.
they
didn't
decide
that
issue.
and
then
reading
from
your
brief,
it
said
the
reason
is
because
the
evidence
comes
far
from
demonstrating
that
smith
suffered
from
a,
quote,
uniquely
severe,
permanent
handicap.
end
quote.
and
that
the
criminal
act
was
attributable
to
this
condition.
am
i
quoting
from
the
right
place?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
brief
in
smith.
all
right.
so
where...
what...
what
was
the
situation
in...
in
this...
tennard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--procedurally
i...
i
see
what...
what
we
have
in...
in
your
case
is
it's...
there's
a
reference
to
lower
court
in
your
brief,
and
i'm
not
sure
which
it
is.
i
thought
that
what
had
happened
is
the
fifth
circuit
had
been
fairly
been
clear
that
their
two
controversial
matters
determined
this.
but
the
fact
is...
and
i'm
trying
to
get
the
procedural
part
right...
is
they
didn't
say
anything.
and
so
all
we
have
is
the
lower...
is
the
lower
court
opinion.
is
that
right?
did...
did
the...
and
the
lower
court
had
said,
well,
one
of
the
reasons
that
they
lose
is
because
the
future
dangerous
part
of
the
texas
test
gives
effect
to
this.
and
that's
where
we
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
you've
done
is
you
got
rid
of
the
other
case
which
did
clearly
present
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
what
you're
saying
now
is
this
case
doesn't
really
present
the
issue
that
we
took
it
to
deal
with.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
do
you
suggest
we
do?
i
mean,
suppose
i
happened
to
think
that...
that
the
texas
fifth
circuit
is
applying
two
tests
that
are
really
erroneous
and
not
a
correct
interpretation?
if
i...
if
i
thought
that
was
a
big
issue
and
maybe
that
was
so,
have
you
any
suggestion
as
to
how
we
should
proceed?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
saying
we've
seen
in
other
cases
like
smith,
for
example,
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
continuously
denied
review
or
reversed
or
affirmed
or
whatever
on
the
basis
of
these
two
tests?
and
so
we
think
it's
a
reasonable
assumption
that
that
played
a
role
in
their
decision
here
too,
particularly
since
whether
this
case
does
fit
within
graham
and...
and
the
other
one
you
cited,
is
certainly
open
to
reasonable
argument.
now,
what
would
be
wrong
with
taking
that
approach?
