justice
john
paul
stevens
suppose
the
defendant
is
despondent
over
global
warming
and...
and
that
has
nothing
to
do
with...
with
the
case.
does
the
jury
hear
that
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
there
are
no
limits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a...
a
question
about
the
operation
of
the
texas
rule?
is
it
your
understanding
that
under
the
texas
rule,
the
evidence
about
how
the
defendant
was
nice
to
his
nieces
and
nephews
would
be
excluded?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
under
the
texas
rule
it
would
come
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what...
what
is
wrong
with
the
nexus
requirement
then
if
it
doesn't
keep
the
evidence
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what's
the
rationale
for
the
nexus
rule?
it's
a...
a
sort
of
a
screening
process
the
fifth
circuit
used
to
determine
harmless
error
or?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
how...
how
does
the
texas
nexus
rule
work
with
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
a
war
record?
he
was
a
military
hero
of
some
kind,
but
he
doesn't
argue
that
affected
his
conduct
in
the
trial,
but
just
as
a
general
matter,
he's
a
man
who
should
be
given
special
consideration
because
of
his...
his
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
happens
under...
in
texas
with
kind
of
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
future
dangerousness?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
clarify
one
thing
for
me?
i
may
have
missed
it.
the
nexus
requirement...
does
that
require
a
nexus
to
the
crime
or
a
nexus
to
the
likelihood
that
he'll
be
dangerous
in
the
future?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then...
then
i
take
it
being
a
veteran
or
a
war
hero
or
something
like
that,
which
clearly
had
nothing
to
do
with
this
particular
crime...
that
would
not
be...
not
satisfy
the
nexus
requirement.
