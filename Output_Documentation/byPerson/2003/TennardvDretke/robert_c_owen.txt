mr.
robert
c.
owen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
question
whether
mitigating
evidence
of
a
67
iq,
of
permanent
cognitive
impairment,
could
be
given
mitigating
effect
under
the
old
texas
capital
sentencing
statute.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
this
court
in
penry
held
that
the
deliberateness
question--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--that
is
in
the
questions
presented,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
in
this
case
the
question
of
the
underlying
merits
of
the
constitutional
issue
before
the
court,
it...
i
don't
want
to
say
merges,
but
it
certainly
overlaps
with
the
question
about
the
certificate
of
appealability
and--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--yes,
your
honor.
but
it
was
also
true
in
penry
ii,
which
when
it
came
to
this
court,
came
from
the
fifth
circuit
on
a
denial
of
coa,
and
this
court
resolved
the
merits
in
that
case
by
examining
the
merits
of
the
underlying
state
court
decision
and
reversed
the
judgment
in
the
case
in
exactly
the
same
fashion
that
we
are
asking
the
court
to
do
in
our
case.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the...
in
fact,
in...
within
the
last
couple
of
years,
the
fifth
circuit
has
taken
those
rules
en
banc
and
has
issued
an
en
banc
opinion
that
applies
and
upholds
not
just
the
nexus
rule,
but
the
other
elaborate
sort
of
framework
of
the
penry
doctrine
that
we've
explained
in
our
brief.
so
i
think
you're
exactly
right,
that
if
the
court
grants
a
coa
and
returns
this
case
to
the
fifth
circuit,
it
will
be
back
here
in
6
months
because
all
the
fifth
circuit
panel
could
do
is
say
it's
controlled
by
the
circuit
precedent.
so
i
think
in...
for
that
reason
as
well,
your
honor,
if
the
court
concludes
that
those
rules
are,
in
fact,
not
consistent
with
its
cases,
that
the
shortest
route
to
resolving
the
case
is
to
do
so
at
this
time.
this
court
in
penry
i
held
that
the
deliberateness
question
was
not
an
adequate
vehicle
for
giving
mitigating
effect
to
a
defendant's
personal
moral
culpability,
and
in
this
case
it
functioned
exactly
the
same
way
as
it
did
in
penry.
also,
the
future
dangerousness
question,
with
respect
to
an
iq
of
67,
could
only
give
that
evidence
aggravating
effect
rather
than
mitigating
effect.
and
in
the
entire
context
of
this
trial,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
arguments
of
counsel
respecting
the
evidence
and
how
it
might
be
treated
by
the
jury,
really
makes
clear
the
existence
of
the
penry
violation.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
there
is
no
atkins
claim
before
this
court,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
we
have
filed
a
successive
application
in
state
court
in
order
to
preserve
mr.
tennard's
rights
to
have
a
determination
of
whether
he's
a
person
with
mental
retardation.
but
the
evidence
at
trial
established
only
his
very
low
iq,
not
the
other
aspects
that
would
have
been
necessary
for
a
diagnosis
of
mental
retardation.
so
there's
no
atkins
claim
before
this
court
in
this
proceeding.
as
i
was
saying,
the
arguments
of
counsel
sort
of
highlight
the
inadequacy
of
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case.
defense
counsel's
argument
was
effectively
a
plea
for
nullification.
he
asked
the
jury
to
take
account
of
the
defendant's
very
low
iq
in...
in
imposing
sentence,
but
he
couldn't
provide
them
any
sort
of
road
map
to
tell
them
how
they
could
get
from
the
low
iq
to
a
no
answer
to
one
of
the
special
issues.
for
his
part,
the
prosecutor,
in
replying
to
that
argument,
said
the
low
iq
is
not
even
relevant
to
the
second
special
issue,
and
those
were
his
words:
not
relevant.
so
to
some
extent
the
state
is
trying
to
have
it
both
ways.
at
trial,
the
prosecution
argued
to
the
jury
that
this
fact,
a
67
iq,
wasn't
relevant
to
the
second
special
issue.
here,
however,
tracking
the
opinion
of
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals,
it's
respondent's
position
that
this
evidence
was
sufficiently
relevant
to
the
second
special
issue
that
the
jury
could
be
understood
to
have
given
it
effect
in
imposing
sentence.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
yes.
excuse
me.
yes,
your
honor.
that...
that
is
a
fair
statement,
and
i
think
that
that
is
exactly
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
with
this
case,
was
it
applied
these
preliminary
doctrines
which
are
effectively
threshold
tests
and
they
looked
at
this
evidence
and
said,
it's
not
uniquely
severe
and
there's
been
no
showing
that
it
caused
the
defendant
to
commit
the
crime.
and
as
a
result,
the
fifth
circuit
never
got
to
the
question
of
how
does
this
evidence
possibly
fit
into
the
special
issues.
because
this
is
a
habeas
case
and
we
want...
we're
trying
to
get
the
court
to...
to
ultimately
grant
relief,
we
wanted
to
explain
why
the
underlying
state
court
decision
constitutes
an
unreasonable
application
of
this
court's
cases.
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
relied,
on
the
one
hand,
on
the
unique
severity
idea.
they
said
this
iq
score,
standing
alone,
doesn't
rise
to
the
level
of
mental
retardation,
so
penry
is
out
of
the
picture.
and
then
it
went
on
to
say
even
if
that's...
even
if
it
was
wrong
about
that
judgment,
there
is
some
way
for
the...
for
the
jury
to
have
given
it
effect
in
answering
the
second
special
issue.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
the...
the
wisdom
of
this
court's
case
in
lockett,
the
wisdom
of
the
lockett
decision
is
that
that
judgment,
the
judgment
that
you're
describing,
is
this
in
fact
mitigating,
does
this
support
a
life
sentence
as
opposed
to
the
death
penalty--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think,
your
honor,
that...
that
the
jury
is
the
person--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--there...
there
shouldn't
be
any
limits
on
admission,
your
honor,
or
on
the
jury's
ability
to
give
that
evidence
effect
if
it
chooses
to
do
so.
at
some
level,
we
are...
we
are
left
to
the
jury...
to
trust
the
jury's
judgment
about
what--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--yes,
your
honor.
there...
there
is--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
although
i
should
point
out
that
to
the
extent
that
the
lower
courts
have,
from
time
to
time,
described
these
threshold
rules,
the
nexus
requirement,
the
severity
requirement,
as
relevance
rules,
rules
of
constitutional
relevance,
it
at
least
holds
out
the
possibility
that
in
a
future
case
a
court
might
choose
to
exclude
evidence
as
irrelevant
to
punishment.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
certainly
think,
your
honor,
that
suggesting
that
the
jury
could
respond
simply
out
of
sympathy
or
emotion
or
an
unfocused
passion
is
precluded
by
the
court's
cases,
and
the
court
has
approved
any
number
of--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think
that
what
you
tell
them--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no,
your
honor.
i...
i
think
that
what
you
have
to
tell
the
jury
is
that
they
are
not
limited
in
responding
to
the
evidence
and
that
they
should
give
the
evidence
their
reasoned
moral
response.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
that
the
bounds
that
lockett
sets
are
clear
enough
to...
to
preclude
some
facts.
i
don't...
at
this
point,
i
don't
have
them
in
mind,
but
let
me
say
that
the
rule
of
lockett,
which
is
any
fact
about
the
defendant's
background
or
character
or
any
of
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
that
is...
i
think
that
is
a...
that
does
provide
sufficient
guidance.
certainly,
your
honor,
every
death
penalty
statute
in
the
country,
including
now
texas',
gives
the...
the
sentencer
very
broad
latitude
to
consider
the
facts
and--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
let...
let
me
say,
your
honor,
that
when...
that
when
the
court
said--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i
think
the
court
could
be
confident--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--the
jury
would
not
ponder
very
long
over
the
question
whether
a
serious
cold
meaningfully
reduced
the
defendant's
culpability
in
a
way
that
made
a
life
sentence
appropriate.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
no
reasonable
juror
could
possibly
accord
the
evidence
any
significance
to
the
ultimate
sentencing
decision,
then
it
would
be
consistent
with
lockett
because
lockett
does
comprehend
facts
about
the--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--absolutely,
your
honor.
this
is
not
a
case
about
a...
a
defendant
with
a
bad
cold.
this
is
a
case
about
a
defendant--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that's
right,
your
honor.
the...
the
severity
test...
we
don't
know
exactly
how
high
it
has
to
be
set
because
in
only
one
case
that
i'm
aware
of
has
the
fifth
circuit
found
it
to
be
satisfied.
so
there
are--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no.
i
think...
i
think--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--not
because
it
was
not
severe
enough,
justice
scalia.
no.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
because
i
do
think
that...
that
lockett
anticipates
that
there
are
facts
about
the
defendant's
character
and
background
which,
according
to
tradition,
according
to
our
understanding
of
what
constitutes
an
appropriate
basis
for
extending
leniency,
which
does
not
limit
itself
to
evidence
that
has
a
nexus
with
the
crime,
that...
that
there
would
be
room
for
a
judge
to
say,
in
an
extreme
case...
and
i'm
not
saying
this
would
be
a
routine
judgment.
i
certainly
think
lockett
suggests
it
would
be
only
a
very
unusual
case
where
a
trial
court
could
say
the
proffered
evidence--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--because
i
don't
think
there's
any
dimension
on...
in
which
it
is
relevant
to
whether
the
defendant
deserves
a
life
sentence
or
the
death
penalty.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
it's
not
relevant
because
it
doesn't
reflect
any--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no,
your
honor.
no.
i--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--well,
i
think
that...
that
if
the
court's...
let
me
back
up
and
say
that
in
any
number
of
cases,
this
court
has
recognized
as
mitigating
circumstances
which
have
no
causal
connection
to
the
crime.
the
best
example
that
i
can
think
of
off
the
top
of
my
head
being
your
opinion,
justice
scalia,
in
hitchcock
where
the
court
recognized
that
mr.
hitchcock's
having
been
a
fond
and
affectionate
uncle
to
the
children
of
his
brother
was
a
fact
which
the
sentencer
had
to
be
allowed
to
consider
in
deciding
whether
he
ought
to
get
the
death
penalty
or
some
lesser
sentence.
and
so
i
think
that
at
a
minimum,
adopting
the
nexus
test
or
the
unique
severity
test
would
require
the
court
to
overrule
all
or
part
of
a
number
of
its
cases,
going
all
the
way
back
to
lockett,
and
that
there
shouldn't
be
any
basis
for
doing
that
since
the
lockett
rule
is
working
perfectly
well
in
practice.
i
think
again--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--no,
your
honor,
and...
and
given
this
court's
very
clear
approval
of
the
new
statute
in
penry
ii
where
this
court
observed
in
passing
that
this
new
statute
and
its
broad
opportunity
for
the
jury
to
consider
mitigation
was
a
clearly
drafted,
catchall
provision
that
complies
with
penry
i,
i
don't
anticipate
that
there
could
be
a
challenge
raised
under
the
new
statute.
the
only
universe
of
cases
that
we
are
talking
about
is
the
universe
of
cases
that
were
sentenced
prior
to
1991
when
texas
changed
its
statute,
and...
and
that
is
a...
a
small
number
of...
of
cases.
probably
85
to
90
percent
of
the
people
on
texas'
death
row
were
sentenced
under
the
new
statute.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no,
your
honor.
that
would...
that
wold
come
in
absolutely.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
nexus...
the
nexus...
the
nexus
rule
or
principle
or
framework
is
a...
is
a...
an
appellate
review
doctrine.
it's
not...
it's
not
a
trial
doctrine.
these
rules
were
developed
by
the
fifth
circuit
and
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
in
trying
to
apply
this
court's
decision
in
penry.
going
all
the
way
back
to
jurek,
it's
always
been
clear
that
evidence
of
the
kind
that
you
describe,
evidence
of
good
behavior,
loved
his
family,
was
a
solid
worker,
all
of
that
evidence
comes
in.
and
it's
all...
it
can
all
be
given
mitigating
consideration
under
the
old
future
dangerousness
question.
it
has
much
broader
consideration
now
under
the
new
statute,
but
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been...
it's
never
been
the
case
that
that...
that
that
evidence
has
been
excludable.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
because
it
denies
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
have
the
jury...
it
refuses
to...
to
allow
a
new
sentencing
hearing
for
a
defendant
who
comes
to
the
appellate
court
and
says,
at
the
time
that
i
was
sentenced,
i
presented
evidence
that
was
clearly
relevant
to
my
culpability,
like
a
67
iq,
and
yet
the
jury
wasn't
instructed
in
such
a
way
that
they
could
give
it
effect.
and
the
appellate
court
says,
well,
if
you
didn't
show
that
your
67
iq
caused
you
to
commit
the
crime,
then
you're
not
going
to
get
that
jury
instruction.
so
it's...
there's
no
problem
with
your
death
sentence.
that
is
the
problem.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the...
the
origin
of
the
nexus
language
is
in
an
attempt
to
understand
what
this
court
meant
in
penry
when
it
said
that
evidence
of
a
defendant's
background
and
character
is
relevant
to
punishment
because
crimes
that
are
attributable
to
bad
background,
mental
problems,
and
so
on
might
deserve
a
less
serious
punishment.
and
it
is...
the
fifth
circuit
has
seized
on,
focused
on
that
word
attributable
and
from
that
elaborated
this
jurisprudence
of
causal,
deterministic
relationship.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
actually,
your
honor,
penry
i
does
say
full
consideration.
in
the...
in
the
interim,
this
court
said
in
johnson
that
the
test
was
not
necessarily
full
consideration
but
meaningful
consideration.
and
so
our
position
is
that
at
the
time
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
decided
this
case
and
said
that
there
was
no
need
for
an
additional
instruction,
they...
at
a
minimum,
the
test
was
johnson's
demand
that
there
be
meaningful
consideration
and
that
under
this
set
of
instructions,
there
was
no
way
to
give
meaningful
consideration
to
the
fact
of
a
67
iq,
and
that
that
is
the...
that
is
the
way
in
which
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
went
astray.
and
in
fact,
that's
illustrated
well,
i
think,
by
the
portions
of
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
opinion
that
try
to
show
how
a
jury,
confronted
with
the
future
dangerousness
question,
could
figure
out
a
chain
of
a
reasoning
that
would
get
you
from
this
guy
has
a
67
iq
to,
therefore,
we
can
answer
no
to
the
future
dangerousness
question.
it
is
based
on...
it
is...
the...
the
chain
of
inferences
that
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
suggests
is
contrary
to
the
evidence
that
was
presented
at
trial
because
it
relies
on
characterizations
of
mr.
tennard
as
a
follower
which
are
not
in
the
evidence
and
aren't
supported
by
the
evidence.
it
is
actually
contrary
to
the
arguments
that
were
made
at
trial
because
the
prosecutor
told
the
jury
that
they
wouldn't
be
allowed
to
consider
what
happened
or
might
happen
in
prison
as
a
way
of
deciding
the
answer
to
the
future
dangerousness
question.
and
it's
contrary
to
this
court's
cases
like
boyd
and
penry
ii
where
the
court
says,
in
deciding
whether
a
jury
was
able
to
give
effect
to
mitigating
evidence
under
the
charge,
you
don't
just
look
at
the
language
of
the
charge,
but
you
look
at
the
evidence,
you
look
at
the
arguments,
you
look
at
the
context
of
the
whole
trial.
the
court
of
criminal
appeals
effectively
covered
up
the
context
of
the
whole
trial
and
said
let's
see
if
we
can
imagine
a
trial
with
different
evidence
and
different
arguments
that
might
have
produced
a
different
result.
and
that...
it
may
be
many
things,
but
that
is
not
a
fair
reading
of
penry.
it
is
not
a...
it
is
not
a
fair
judgment
of
whether
the
jury
in
this
case
was
able
to
give
meaningful
consideration
to
the
fact
of
mr.
tennard's
67
iq.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
that
evidence...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i
think
that
what
the...
what
the
court
would
say
is
that
you
don't
have
to
get
to
the
question
of
whether
he
showed
a
nexus
because
that's
the
kind
of
evidence
that
has
a
natural
home
in
the
future
dangerousness
question.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
your
honor,
i
believe
what
the...
i
believe
what
texas
would
say...
and
i'm
not
saying...
this
is
my
view.
but
i
think
what
texas
would
say
is
that
in
the
abstract,
good
character
evidence
shows
a
lack
of
dangerousness,
and
for
that
reason,
it
can
be
given
effect
by
returning
a
no
answer
to
the
future
dangerousness
question.
i
think
the--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in...
in
boyd
v.
california,
your
honor
observed
that
certain
evidence
of
good
character
could
be
understood
as
showing
that
the
crime
is
an
aberration
from
otherwise
good
character.
at
the
same
time,
justice
stevens,
i
think
that
it
was...
it
was
correctly
observed
by
the
concurring
opinion
in
franklin
that
there
may
be
more
relevance
to
some
of
those
circumstances
than
just
the
fact
that
it
doesn't
make
you
dangerous.
but
i
think
we
are
down
the
road
from
that
point,
and
our
point
is
this
evidence,
the
67
iq,
is
evidence
that
a
juror
could
reasonably
conclude
makes
you
more
dangerous,
and
in
the
absence
of
some
additional
instruction,
the
jury
simply
had
no
vehicle
for
expressing
the...
the
conclusion
that
even
having
killed
deliberately
and
even
though
this
person
poses
a
risk
of
future
danger,
because
of
his
reduced
culpability
as
reflected
in
his
67
iq,
a
life
sentence
is
the
appropriate
sentence.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
in
penry,
this
court
suggested
that
it
might
be
possible
to
define
the
term...
let
me
back
up
and
say,
remember,
there's
a...
the
first
special
issue
asks
the
jury
whether
the
defendant
killed
deliberately
and
with
the
reasonable
expectation
that
death
would
result.
in
penry,
this
court
at
least
held
out
the
possibility
that
there
might
be
a
definition
of
deliberately
which
the
jury
could
be
provided
that
would
focus
their
attention
directly
on
the
defendant's
personal
culpability.
i
am...
i...
i
have
tried
to
come
up
with
that
definition,
but
i...
it
is
hard
to
hard
imagine.
i
actually
think
that
the
best,
clearest,
most
obvious
solution
is
a
supplemental
question
that
effectively
directs
the
jury,
having
decided
the
deliberateness
and
future
dangerousness
questions,
to
consider
all
the
mitigating
evidence
and
reach
an
appropriate
judgment
about
the
defendant's
culpability.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
this
court
in--
mr.
robert
c.
owen
--this
court
in
bell
v.
ohio,
the
companion
case
to
lockett,
said
that
bell's
low
average
intelligence,
or
dull,
normal
intelligence,
was
a
mitigating
factor
that
the
sentencer
had
to
be
allowed
to
consider.
we
know
from
the
briefs
in
that
case
that
the
iq
score
for
mr.
bell
ranged
between
81
to
90,
so
we
know
that
90
is
something
the
jury
has
got
to
consider.
in
burger
v.
kemp,
the
court
observed
that
mr.
burger's
82
iq
was
a...
was
a
mitigating
circumstance
which
the
jury
would
have
to
be
instructed
to
consider,
had
it
been
offered
by
counsel.
we
know
from
mccoy
v.
north
carolina
that
74
is
an
iq
that
counts
as
a
mitigating
circumstance.
i
think
every
reasonable
juror
would
understand,
particularly
when
counsel
is
urging
vigorously
this
is
a
very
low
iq,
as
counsel
did
in
this
case...
would
understand
that
it
does
substantially
reduce
moral
culpability.
your
honor,
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
i...
i
tried
to
count
them
myself,
your
honor,
and
my
number
was
closer
to
50.
and
i
don't
know
on
what...
i
don't
know
where
or
how
we
disagree,
but
i
think
the
universe
of
cases
is...
is
obviously
more
than
perhaps
40
and...
and
i
guess
by
his
count
fewer
than
100.
again,
it's
only
the
people
who
were
sentenced...
and
again,
i
think
we
need
to
emphasize
that
a
ruling
in
favor
of
mr.
tennard
would
only
affect
the
sentences
of
people
who
introduced
mitigating
evidence
at
their
trial
that
had
relevance
to
moral
culpability
outside
the
inquiries
that
the
jury
received
in
its
instructions.
so,
again,
there
would
be
a
subset
beyond
the
number
of
cases
just
tried
prior
to
1991
that
would
include
the
cases
in
which
certain
kinds
of
mitigating
evidence
like
the
67
iq
in
this
case
were
introduced.
let
me
address
justice
breyer's
question
first
about
the
fifth
circuit's
treatment
of
the
claim
in
this
case.
justice
breyer,
i'd
like
to
refer
you
to
pages
20
to
22
of
our
brief,
and
at
those
pages
we
described
the
way
in
which
the
fifth
circuit
analyzed
the
claim
in
our
case.
and
i
think
it
is...
it
is
the
case
that
they
applied
both
the
unique
severity
test
and
the
nexus
test
and
found
us
wanting
on
both
scores.
and
then
ultimately,
in
the
way
that
the
fifth
circuit
has,
having
reached
the
merits,
it
said
that
we
didn't
get
a
coa.
so
i'm...
i'm
not
sure.
i
think...
but
that...
they
did...
they
did
apply
the
test,
and
so
i
don't
think
there
would
be
anything
inappropriate
about
this
court
assessing
the
appropriateness
of
the
test.
with
respect
to
the
trial
record,
i
do
want
to
emphasize
that
the
word
follower
does
not
appear
in
defense
counsel's
closing
argument.
defense
counsel
did
not
make
the
argument
that
mr.
tennard
was
a
follower,
that
his
67
iq
made
him
a
follower,
that
he
followed
other
people
in
committing
this
crime.
there
is
only
one...
one
comment
from
defense
counsel,
a
single
sentence
in
the
course
of
the
closing
argument
which
says
with
respect
to
an
earlier
crime
that
mr.
tennard
was
involved
in,
that
he
was
not
the
leader.
he
doesn't
say,
and
he
was
less
culpable
than
anybody
else.
he
doesn't
say,
he
only
got
involved
in
that
crime
because
he
was
following
somebody
else.
this
is
not
a
case
that
was
defended
at
trial
on
the
theory
that
mr.
tennard,
because
of
his
67
iq,
is
a
follower.
it
is
a
case
that
was
defended
at
trial
on
the
theory
that
having
a
67
iq
is
the
sort
of
globally
disabling
quality
that
affects
everything
mr.
tennard
does,
every
action
that
he
takes,
every
thought
that
he
has,
every
judgment
that
he
makes.
mr.
robert
c.
owen
it
is
certainly
argued,
your
honor,
that...
as
defense
counsel
puts
it
to
the
jury,
he
says,
you
have
a
man
who
has
an
iq
that
is
that
low,
and
he
says
to
the
jury,
none
of
you
know
what
it's
like
to
have
a
67
iq.
and
i
think...
and
the...
and
the
prosecutor,
for
his
part,
doesn't
dispute
the
lowness
of
the
iq
score.
the
prosecutor's
argument
isn't,
oh,
come
now,
a
67
iq
isn't
that
low.
the
prosecutor's
argument
is,
under
these
instructions,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
you're
not
asked
why
mr.
tennard
became
a
danger.
you're
being
asked
whether
he's
a
danger.
that's
the
only
thing
that
the...
that
the
jury
was
asked
to
consider.
i
think
that...
that
it's
important
to
keep
in
mind
the
quality
of
this
mitigating
evidence.
it
also
was
suggested
that
counsel
didn't
object
to
the
instructions,
didn't
ask
for
a
special
instruction.
while
he
did
not
ask
for
a
special
instruction
at
the
point
of
the
jury
charge,
there
is
a
pretrial
motion
filed
by
defense
counsel
which
complains
that
the
texas
statute
does
not
permit
the
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances,
which
asked
for
definitions
of
the
key
terms
in
the
statute,
and
that
was
denied.
so
it's...
it's
certainly
not
a
case
in
which
there
was...
it
was...
you
know,
the
people
at
trial
were
unaware
of
this
problem
with
the
instructions.
that's
evident
from
defense
counsel's
argument.
i
think
that
the...
the
one...
one
thing
i
want
to
emphasize
about
the
nature
of
this
mitigating
evidence
is
the
way
in
which
it's...
it's...
it
does
affect
moral
culpability.
and
the
quote
i
found
that
i
liked
the
best
on
this
actually
is
from
a
concurring
opinion
in
skipper
where,
in
the
course
of
explaining
why
they
felt
that
evidence
of
good
behavior
in
jail
didn't
qualify
as
eighth
amendment
mitigating
evidence,
justice
powell
joined,
among
others,
by
chief
justice
rehnquist,
said,
evidence
of
a
reduced
capacity
for
considered
choice
bears
directly
on
the
fundamental
justice
of
imposing
capital
punishment.
this
evidence
in
our
case
is
evidence
of
that
kind
of
reduced
capacity
that
the
jury
had
no
vehicle
for
giving
that
kind
of
mitigating
effect
to
in
imposing
sentence.
we'd
ask
the
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
below.
