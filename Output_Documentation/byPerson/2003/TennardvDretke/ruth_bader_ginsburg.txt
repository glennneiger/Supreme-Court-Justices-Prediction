justice
ruth
bader

may
i
ask
you,
mr.
owen?
you
are
claiming
low
iq.
you
did
not
in...
in
your
papers
up
till
now...
you
did
not
make
a
claim
of
retardation,
just
low
iq.
is
that
still
the...
there
is
no...
in
other
words,
is
no
atkins
claim
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
circuit...
isn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the...
the
question
about
what
is
a
mitigating
circumstance
would
come
up
under
texas'
current
instruction
2,
the
instruction
that
says
that
you
can
consider
all
the
mitigating
evidence,
consider
all
the
mitigating
evidence.
what
is
mitigating
evidence?
that's
a
discrete
question
from
the
one
that's
before
us.
whatever
it
is,
it's
a
higher...
something
higher
than
mitigating
evidence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr....
mr.
owen,
is
this
position
of
the...
the
severity
and
the
nexus
peculiar
to
the
pre-1991
sentences?
that
is,
have
any
cases
come
to
the
fifth
circuit
involving
the
new
law
that
simply
says
the
jury
can
consider
all
mitigating
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
anything
do
short
of
the
catchall
that
texas
has
had
since
1991?
you
say
the
severity
and
nexus
test
is
no
good
and
you
say
that
the
current
catchall
is
okay.
is
there
anything
in
between
those
two
that
would
be
constitutionally
adequate?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
you're
wrong
about
that.
if
this...
if
the
fifth
circuit's
test
is
a
misinterpretation
of
penry,
then
i
take
it
you
lose
this
case.
and
if
the
fifth
circuit
has
misinterpreted
penry's...
what
penry
means--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
is
the
state...
i
thought
that
at
one
point
you
told
us
that...
that
the
fifth
circuit
got
the
severity
and
nexus
threshold
requirements
from
the
state,
that
the
state
initiated
those
requirements.
and
now
you
say
but
in
tennard's
case,
as
distinguished
from
smith,
the
state
applied
some
other
test?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you...
you
seem
to...
what
you
said
were...
you
recited
four
factors,
but
it
sounded
like
severity
was
one
and
nexus
was
another.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
something
the
state
would
know
if
it
were
given
in
a
state
prison?
if
the
tests
were
given
at
a
certain
period
of
time
in
a
state
prison,
that's...
that's
something
that
the
state
could
easily
find
out
what
were
they
giving
at
the
time.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
somebody
connected
with
the
state
correction
system
would
know,
would
they
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
state
could
have
informed
itself
fully
of
what
goes
on
at
state
prisons
with
regard
to
iq
tests.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
owen,
is
your
understanding
the
same
as
mr.
marshall's
that
we're
talking
about
a
universe
of
100
cases?
