justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
doesn't
have
to
be
related
to
the...
to
the
crime
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
what...
how...
how
can
that
be?
i
mean,
what
if
they
bring
in
evidence
that
this
person
was
severely
dyslexic?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
that's
a
great
handicap
and...
and
you
must
feel
sorry
for
the
poor
fellow,
but
what
does
it
have
to
do
with
mitigating
the
fact
that
he
murdered
somebody?
you
know,
how...
how
does...
how
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
mitigating?
i
mean,
what
we're
looking
for
here
is
mitigation.
that
means
somehow
it
makes
the
act
that
he
committed
less
heinous
than
it
otherwise
would
be.
and
you
say
it
doesn't
matter.
dyslexia
should...
should
count.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there...
are
there
any
other
areas
where...
where
we
just
say,
you
know,
there...
there
are
no
rules
at
all.
the
jury...
whatever
it
likes.
the
fellow
had
a
limp,
and
therefore,
if
you
feel
sorry
for
him
because
he
had
a
limp,
that...
you
can
determine,
even
though
it
clearly
is
not
true
that
this
somehow
mitigates
his
guilt
for...
for
the
murder
he
committed.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
so...
so
what
do
you
tell
them
in
order
to
prevent
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
have
to
tell
them
what
the
fifth
circuit
suggests?
you
have
to
find
that
there's
some
kind
of
a
connection
between
this
evidence
and
the
crime
that
he
committed,
that...
that,
you
know,
it...
it
somehow
caused
it
so
that
he's
less
guilty
than
somebody
that
did
not
have
that
affliction
would
be.
isn't
that...
isn't
that
exactly
what
you're
looking
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about...
what
about
the
other...
the
other
factor
that
you
say
the
fifth
circuit
shouldn't
have
taken
into
account,
that
is,
severity
of
the...
of
the
factor
that
the
defendant
claims
mitigates?
what...
you
say
that...
that
should
not
come
into...
come
into
consideration
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he
can...
he
can
tell
the
jury,
you
know,
i
had
a
really
bad
cold
that
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
seriously
we...
we
have
to
let
the
jury
just
ponder
over
that
question,
whether
the
fact
that
he
had
a
really
bad
cold--
justice
antonin
scalia
--should
mitigate
his
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
higher
than
mitigating
evidence?
i
don't
understand.
i...
i
thought
you
had
just
acknowledged
in...
in
the...
in
the
exchange
with
justice
souter
that
a
cold
wouldn't
be
mitigating
because
it
was
not
severe
enough.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
that
isn't
the
reason.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
well,
why...
why
did
you
agree
with
justice
souter
that
a...
that
a
cold
could
be
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
to
tell
me
why?
all
i
asked
is
why.
what
is...
what
is
it
that
brought
you
to
the
judgment
that
a
cold
could
be
excluded?
you
say
it
is
not
because
it
is
too
insignificant.
that
doesn't
count.
and
you
say
it's
not
because
it
has
no
connection
to
the...
to
the
criminal
act
that
he
committed.
what...
what
brings
you
to
say
that
it
can
be
excluded?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
relevant
because
of
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
because...
because
colds
don't
count
or,
you
know,
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suggest
that...
that
the
reason
you
feel
it's...
it's
not
relevant
is
because
either
it's
too
insignificant
or
it
has
no
relation
whatever
to
the
act
that
he
committed,
one
or
the
other
of
those.
maybe
both.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
in
this
case...
and
i
guess
in
all...
all
of
the
cases
involving
the...
the
old
texas
instruction,
the
state
court
was
proceeding
not
under
penry
ii,
but
just
under
penry
i.
and
it
didn't...
penry
ii
is
the
case
that
required
full
consideration
be
given
to
all
mitigating
circumstances.
penry
i
didn't
require
that.
it
just
said
there
had
to
be
some...
some
means
of
giving
consideration
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm...
i'm
a
little
puzzled
about
why
you...
you're
not
asserting
that
this
defendant
was
retarded.
you're
just
asserting
that
he
was
not...
not
too
quick.
is
that...
is
that...
i
mean,
is
that
a
mitigating
factor?
he's
not
retarded.
he's
just...
he's
just
not
a
whiz
kid.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
we
should...
that
has
to
be
taken
into
account
by
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
opposing
counsel
says,
however,
we
don't
even
have
to
get
to
that
argument,
that
maybe
if
the
fifth
circuit
had
considered
the
case
aright,
it
would
agree
with
you
on
that
point.
but
it
never
got
to
that
point.
it
applied
its...
its
two
factors
and
therefore
never
even
had
to
consider
what
you're
presenting
to
us.
it
just
said
no
causality
and
not...
not
severe
enough.
what...
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you're
saying--
justice
antonin
scalia
could...
could
i
get
back
to
what
you
had
just
said
before
justice
breyer
asked
you
the
question?
you...
you
were...
you
were
describing
why
it
is
that
these
two
tests
do,
indeed,
bear
upon
the
penry
determination.
you...
you
said,
as
i
understand
it,
if
it
isn't
severe
enough,
it
can
be
taken
into
account
in
the
future
dangerousness
determination.
right?
if
it's
too
severe,
the
only
way
it
can
cut
is
to
make
him
more
dangerous
in
the
future,
but
if
it's...
if
it's
milder,
it
can
be...
it
can
be...
it
can
cut
both
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
what
about
the
other
one?
what
about
the...
the
nexus
requirement?
how
does
that
bear
upon
the
penry...
the
penry
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
with
respect
to
the
first,
i
can
understand
why
it
bears
upon
the
penry
thing.
with
respect
to
the
second,
it
seems
sensible,
but
i
don't...
i
don't
see
how
it
has
any
bearing
on
the...
on...
on
whether
you
can
give
that...
that
factor
some
effect
under
the
special
issues.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
i
mean
it...
it
accidentally
had
a
nexus
to
the
crime
because,
you
know,
he
claimed
that
he
was
a
follower
in
this
crime.
what
if
he
introduced
the
same
evidence?
he
has
a
low
iq
and
in
all
other
situations
he's
a
follower,
but
there's
no
direct
evidence
that
in
this
crime...
in
this
crime
he
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
need
the
nexus
in
order
to
make
it
considerable
by
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i...
that's
what
i
would
say.
i...
i
don't
know
why
you
concede
so
readily
that
it
has
no...
no
causal
nexus.
i...
i
think
the
reason
that...
that
we
usually
allow
that
as
mitigating
evidence
is
that,
you
know,
you...
you
beat
a
kid
cruelly
and
he
turns
out
to
be
a
cruel
kid.
i
don't
know
why...
why
you...
why
you
make
the
concession.
has
the
fifth
circuit
ever
used
its
nexus
requirement
to
exclude
evidence
of
severe
maltreatment
as
a...
as
a
child?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
other
factor.
that's
not
the
nexus
factor.
that's
the
severity
factor.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
argument
made?
