justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
another
preliminary
question?
i
thought
that
what
was
at
issue
is
whether
the
certificate
of
appealability
was
properly
denied.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
you
seem
to
be
asking
us
to
grant
habeas
relief,
and
i
would
have
thought
what
we
had
to
consider
was
the
denial
of
the
certificate
of
appealability.
am
i
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you...
do
you
think
the
fifth
circuit's
uniquely
severe,
permanent
handicap
and
nexus
tests
are
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
penry
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
if
we
thought
that
the
certificate
of
appealability
should
have
been
granted,
i
suppose
you
would
then
argue,
when
it
went
back,
that
those
are
the
right
tests
to
employ?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i...
i
have
a
lot
of
trouble
seeing
how
the
first
uniquely
severe,
permanent
handicap
test
is...
is
proper
in
light
of
penry.
that's
a
pretty
low
iq
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
robert
tennard,
was
found
guilty
of
capital
murder
in
1986.
during
the
penalty
phase
of
his
trial,
he
presented
evidence
that
he
had
an
iq
of
67.
the
jury
was
instructed
to
determine
the
appropriate
punishment
by
considering
two
questions:
first,
whether
tennard
had
committed
the
crime
deliberately;
second,
whether
he
presented
the
risk
of
future
dangerousness?
in
penry
versus
lynaugh,
we
held
some
years
ago
that
these
two
so-called
special
issues
did
not
provide
the
jury
with
a
constitutionally
adequate
vehicle
by
which
to
give
effect
to
penry’s
evidence
of
mental
retardation
and
childhood
abuse.
in
state
postconviction
review,
and
again
in
his
federal
habeas
petition,
tennard
in
this
case,
argued
that
the
rule
of
penry
had
been
violated
in
his
case
because
the
special
issues
did
not
adequately
permit
the
jury
to
give
effect
to
his
low
iq
evidence.
the
district
court
held
that
the
state
court’s
application
of
penry
was
not
unreasonable
and
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
denied
a
certificate
of
appealability.
following
a
course
that
has
consistently
taken
in
cases
involving
claims
based
on
penry,
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
applied
a
screening
test
to
tennard’s
claim.
under
that
screening
test,
that
court
will
not
consider
whether
evidence
presented
by
habeas
petitioner
was
within
the
jury’s
effective
reach
as
required
by
penry
unless
the
petitioner
first
establishes
both
of
the
evidence
was
of
uniquely
severe
permanent
handicap
and
that
there
was
a
nexus
between
the
uniquely
severe
condition
in
the
crime.
in
this
case,
we
now
reject
that
screening
test.
it
is
not
based
on
any
of
this
court’s
decisions
and
it
is
inconsistent
with
our
prior
discussions
of
the
principles
guiding
evidentiary
relevance
in
capital
sentencing.
we
address
next
the
question
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
should
have
considered,
that
is
whether
reasonable
jurors
could
find
debatable
or
wrong
the
district
court’s
disposition
of
tennard’s
penry
claim.
we
conclude
that
reasonable
jurors
could
so
find
the
relationship
between
the
special
issues
and
tennard’s
very
low
iq
evidence
as
the
same
essential
features
as
the
relationship
between
those
issues
and
penry’s
retardation
evidence.
we
hold
that
a
certificate
of
appealability
should
have
issued.
accordingly,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
proceedings.
the
chief
justice
and
justices
scalia
and
thomas
have
each
filed
dissenting
opinions.
