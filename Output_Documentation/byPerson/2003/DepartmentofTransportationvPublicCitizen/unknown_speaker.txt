unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
just
a...
a
background
fact.
perhaps
i
missed
it,
but
was
there
any
parallel
in
canada?
we're
talking
about
mexico
or
mexican
vehicles.
i
understood
that
originally
there
was
the
same
limitation
for
both.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
because
i'm
really
kind
of
confused
about
this.
i'm
trying
to
think
through
the
case.
assume
the
president
wasn't
involved
at
all
and
congress
had
decided
to
lift
the
moratorium
and
enact
it
and
did
everything
the
president
did
and
said,
but
before
you
do
it,
we
want
you
to,
as
a
precondition,
adopt
these
safety
regulations.
would
your
position
be
any
different?
unknown
speaker
it
wouldn't
be
any
different.
i...
you...
you--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
you
were
saying
it's--
--your
position
would
be
the
same.
unknown
speaker
oh,
well--
unknown
speaker
--you
scared
me
for
a
minute.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
in
either
event,
it
would
not
have
been
the
kind
of
major
federal
action
that
must
be
preceded
by
an
eis.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
basic
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
but...
but
it
wouldn't
be
a
question
of
second
guessing,
would
it,
if
the
agency
regulations
in
question
could
reduce
somehow
the...
the
impact
that
the...
the
known
action
by
the
president,
who's
pretty
sure
this
was
going
to
happen,
would
cause?
and...
and
so
it's
sort
of
relevant,
it
seems
to
me,
whether
these
rules
issued
by
the
agency
could,
if
there
had
been
an
environmental
impact
statement,
have
been
adjusted
in
such
a
way
as
to
reduce
the...
the
environmental
impact.
is
there
any
relationship
between
these
rules
and
the
environmental
impact
that
the
respondents
are
concerned
about?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
mean,
my
point
is
it...
it
seems
to
me
obvious
that
you
don't
have
to
evaluate
in
an
environmental
impact
statement
something
that
you
have
no
power--
unknown
speaker
--to...
to
remedy.
unknown
speaker
when
did
respondents
first
make
this
point?
you
say
they
didn't
make
it
in--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
kneedler,
on...
on
that...
going
to
that
point,
i
mean,
that
goes
to
something
justice
scalia
raised
and
i
wanted
to
raise
it
too.
he...
he
expressed,
as
a
premise
to
his
question...
and
i
had
assumed
when
i
started
out
on
this
case...
that
the
agency
does
not
have
to
prepare
an
impact
statement
which
takes
into
consideration
effects
that
the
agency
itself
does
not
have
the
authority
to
avoid.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
i'm
looking...
by
the
way,
i'm
on
page...
what
is
it...
2a
of...
of
your
brief
where
you
set
out
the
statute
down
at
the
bottom
of
the
page,
roman
(i).
one
of
the
things
the
agency
has
got
to
disclose
is
the
environmental
impact
of
the
proposed
action.
that
i
understand.
they
could
avoid
that
in...
theoretically
in...
in
the
general
rule.
they
could
say,
well,
we
won't
take
the
proposed
action
if
it
has
a
very
bad
effect.
and
that's
consistent
with
what
he
assumed
and
what
i
assumed.
but
then
you
get
to
roman
(ii)
and
roman
(ii)
says
they've
got
to
disclose
any
adverse
environmental
effects
which
cannot
be
avoided
should
the
proposal
be
implemented.
and
that
seems
to
be
broader.
that
seems
to
say
if
your
proposal,
which
in
itself
may
be
environmentally
benign,
is
the
trigger
for
action
by
other
agencies
or
other
people,
which
is
not
environmentally
benign,
you've
got
to
disclose
the
effects
that
will
come
about
when
you
take
the
triggering
action
even
though
you're
triggering
action
is
clean.
am
i...
am
i
misreading
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if...
if
that's
the...
if...
if
the...
if...
i'll
call
it
(c)(ii)
here...
is...
is
being
read
in
that
way,
then
i
take
it
what
it
means...
let's
forget
the
presidential
action
here.
let's
just
take
conventional
government
action.
if
you
had,
let's
say,
six
government
agencies,
each
of
which
on
a
coordinated
basis
was
going
to
do
something
to
bring
about
a
result,
and
the
effect
of
the
action
of
each
one
of
those
agencies
by
itself
really
didn't
amount
to
much,
but
the
action
of
all
six
together
amounted
to
a
very
great
deal
environmentally,
there
never
would
be
an
environmental
impact
statement
that
would
take
into
effect
the
cumulative
action.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
that
fair
to
say?
unknown
speaker
then
why
doesn't
that
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
talking
about
the
cumulative
effect.
i...
i
thought...
maybe
i
misunderstood
what
you've
said.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
under
the
council
of
environmental
quality
reg,
at
some
point
they
had
to
take
into
effect...
they
had
to
disclose
the
cumulative
effect.
unknown
speaker
the
effect
of
all
the
agencies
together
in
my
hypothesis.
you've
got
six
agencies.
each
of
them
does
a
little
thing.
add
the
six
together.
you
get
a
big
thing.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
under
the
council
on
environmental
quality
regs,
somewhere
along
the
line
somebody
has
got
to
disclose
in
an...
in
an
impact
statement--
unknown
speaker
--the
cumulation.
unknown
speaker
so
why
wasn't
it
done
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
under
roman
(i),
but
under
roman
(ii)
it's
broader,
and
you
said,
i
thought,
under
the
council
on
environmental
quality
regs,
at
some
point
you've
got
to
disclose
the
cumulative
effect
of
all
of
it.
so
on
my
hypothesis,
it's...
when...
who...
what
agency
and
when
has
to
disclose
the
cumulative
effect--
unknown
speaker
--and
why
wasn't
it
done
here?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying--
unknown
speaker
--it...
it
would
have
been
done
here
but
for
the
fact
that
the
president
is
not
an
agency.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
you're
saying
because
the
president
is
not
an
agency,
that
doesn't
apply
here.
unknown
speaker
now,
does
the...
does
the
council
on
environmental
quality
regulation
say
that
the...
that
the
disclosure
of
cumulative
effect
depends
upon
the
action
of
many
agencies
as
opposed
to
the
actions
of
many
persons
to
which
an
agency
contributes?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--then
why
didn't
it
apply
here?
we'll
assume
the
president
is
not
an
agency.
why
didn't
that
requirement
apply
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
did
350
limit
itself
in
its
directions
to
the
agency
to
safety
matters?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
another
kind
of
preliminary
question?
i
was
just
reexamining
the
statute
that
justice
souter
was
calling
your
attention
to.
and
the
president,
of
course,
is
not
an
agency
within
the
meaning
of
the
introductory
paragraph.
does
that
mean
that
an
action
taken
by
the
president
is
not
a
major
federal
action
within
the
meaning
of
subparagraph
(c)?
unknown
speaker
because
if
i'm
an
agency--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
it
should
read
any
major
federal
action
undertaken
by
the
agency--
unknown
speaker
--is
implicitly--
unknown
speaker
--and...
and
we've
held
that?
it's
certainly
a
permissible
reading
of
it.
i'm
not
sure
it's
a
necessary
reading.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
fact,
an
agency
could
produce
an
eis
that
said
what
we
propose
to
do
is
disastrous
and
nevertheless
go
ahead,
could
it
not?
unknown
speaker
that
is...
that
is
set
forth
in
the
regulations?
unknown
speaker
mr....
mr.
kneedler,
i...
i
read
the
regs
the
same
way
you
do.
the...
the
interesting
thing
to
me
was,
although
it's
probably...
i
guess
it's
academic
here
is
that
the
statute
seems
to
be
broader
than
the
regs
because
the...
the
statute
would...
would
require
attention...
and
i'm
reading
from
page
45
of
your...
your
brief
where
you
set
it
out
in
the
carryover
paragraph.
the...
the
statute
would...
would
require
attention
to...
to
anything
by...
done
by
the
agency
which
would
not
only
cause
but
contribute
to
a
new
air
quality...
to
an
air
quality
violation.
and
i...
i
would
suppose
even
on
the
kind
of
the...
the
low-level
effect
that
the
agency
has
disclosed
here,
idling
motors
and
so
on,
that
the...
that
the
statute
would
cover
it,
although
the
regs
are
narrower
and
the
regs
wouldn't
cover
it.
do
you
read
the
statute
the
same
way?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
they
would
have
to
disclose
it.
i
mean,
if...
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
without
the
narrow...
i...
i
don't
mean
to
load
the
dice
when
i
say
narrowing...
without
the
agency
interpretation,
the
statute
would
be
broad
enough
at
least
to...
to
require
this
agency
to
disclose
its
contribution.
unknown
speaker
i
know.
may
i...
may
i
ask
this
other
question
just
in
displaying
my
ignorance
of
the
whole
problem?
but
is
it
not
conceivable
that
consistently
with
the
statute,
that
the
agency
could
be
compelled
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
but
nevertheless
not
suspend
the...
or
nevertheless
let
the
trucks
come
in?
unknown
speaker
no.
assume
you
read
the
statute
to
require
them
to
make
a
statement.
does
it
necessarily
follow
that
the...
the...
there
must
be
an
injunction
against
the
trucks
coming
in
while
they...
while
they
do
that?
i
know
normally
it's...
it's
done
that--
unknown
speaker
--which
the
converse
of
that
is
that
even
if
you're
right,
conceivably...
i
mean,
even
if
your
basic
concern
is
right
that
the
trucks
should
come
in,
conceivably
the
duty
to
prepare
the
statement
might
remain.
unknown
speaker
but
this...
this
case
involves
the
president,
so
it's
a
very
unusual
case.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
assuming
it
was
an
agency
that
had
some
discretion
in
the
matter,
my
understanding
is
it...
it
can't
go
ahead
without
first
making
the
environmental
impact
statement.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
weissglass,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
this
wasn't
your
argument.
your
argument
was,
as...
as
i
understood
it,
that
the
reason
the
eis
had
to
be
prepared
was
not
because
there
would
be
any
substantial
environmental
impact
from
the
nature
of
the
safety
standards,
but
because
no
trucks
at
all
can
come
in
until...
until
the
agency
comes
out
with
this...
with
these
standards.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
okay.
therefore,
that's
a
consequence
of
the
agency
action.
therefore,
the
agency
has
to
do
an
eis.
unknown
speaker
now,
just
let
me
ask.
the...
that
happens
because
the
president's
action
is
triggered
by
or
cannot
occur
until
the
agency
takes
this
action.
suppose
you
have
a
mad
millionaire
who
has
applied
for
a...
a
license
from
the
federal
communications
commission
and
there
are
others
who
are
competing
for
the
same
license,
and
he
announces
that
if
he
is
denied
the
license
and
the
license
is
given
to
somebody
else,
he
is
going
to
unleash
a
flood
of
trucks
around
the
country,
pouring
out
emissions
and...
and
greatly
affecting
the...
the
air
quality
throughout
the
country.
does
the
fcc,
knowing
that
this
is
going
to
be
the
consequence
of
their
granting
the
license
to
this
particular
individual...
does
it
have
to
do
an
environmental
impact
statement?
unknown
speaker
concerning,
you
know,
what
the
environmental
impact
of
the...
of
the
mad
millionaire's
actions
are
going
to
be?
unknown
speaker
has
no
control
over
the
mad
millionaire,
just
as
this
agency
has
no
control
over
the
president.
unknown
speaker
the
mad
millionaire
put
it
in
writing.
it...
it's
sworn
to.
it's
absolutely
certain
he's
going
to
do
it.
he
really
is
crazy.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it
does.
it
can
deny
the
license
to
this
person
and
give
it
to
somebody
else.
unknown
speaker
so
the
fcc
would
have
to
do
an
eis
in
this
situation.
unknown
speaker
that's
absurd.
unknown
speaker
fine.
now,
suppose--
--that
is
so
absurd.
--instead
of
the
mad
millionaire,
what
the...
we
have
the
mad
millionaire.
but
now
what
the
statute
says
is
every
license
that's
issued
for
safety...
safety
purposes...
has
to
be
a
stamp
that
you
put
in
the
car,
and
then
there's
a
rule
that
says,
no
stamp
shall
issue
until
the
post
office
department
certifies
it
will
be
red
or
blue.
all
right?
and
moreover,
there
could
be
an
environmental
impact
just
from
the
red
and
blue.
i
mean,
one
reflects
the--
now,
the
post
office
knows
that
if
it
tells
you
what
color
it
is,
then
they'll
have
it,
and
if
they
have
it,
they
give
out
the
license.
and
if
they
give
out
the
license,
the
mad
millionaire
is
going
to
let
loose
smoke
throughout
the
nation.
does
that
mean
that
the
post
office
department
has
to
write
an
environmental
impact
statement
about
the
mad
millionaire?
no.
the
answer
is
clearly
no.
isn't
it?
but
the
only
problem
is
your
theory
doesn't
tell
me
why.
unknown
speaker
and
so
does
the
post
office.
it's
going
to
be
red
or
blue.
now,
the
relationship
between
the
red
and
blue
choice
and
environmental
being
wrecked
through
the
smoke
of
the
mad
millionaire
is
zero.
and
now,
you
want
to
say
that's
not
true
with
this
safety
regulation.
so
explain
why.
unknown
speaker
now,
was
this
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit
decision?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
in...
in--
--but
the
ninth
circuit
seemed
to
me
to
speak
in
terms
of
but-for
causation
and
that
just
because
the
agency
knew
that
many
more
trucks
were
going
to
be
coming
in,
even
though
as
a
result
of
somebody
else,
the
fact
that
the
agency...
that
they
couldn't
come
in
until
the
agency
acted
meant
that
the
agency
had
to
do
an
eis.
that...
that
seems
a
very
doubtful
proposition
to
me.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
permit
could
have
forbidden
the
action.
the
permit
related
to
whether...
the...
the
agency's
decision
related
to
whether
this
construction
company
could
build
a
ski
resort
or
not.
this
agency's
action
has
no
bearing
upon...
upon
the
environment.
it
has
no
bearing
upon
whether
the...
the
president
can
take
his
independent
action.
it's
just
been
artificially
connected
just
the
way
the
mad
millionaire's
was.
unknown
speaker
they...
they
were
not
part
of
the...
of
the
program
to
decide
whether
the
ski
resort
is
going
to
be
built.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
can't
the...
isn't
the
agency's
discretion
to
determine
whether
older
trucks
come
in
or
not
a
discretion
which
is
supposed
to
be
exercised
on
the
basis
of
safety
considerations
rather
than
environmental
considerations?
unknown
speaker
those
safety
considerations
that
are
within
its
control
that
would
be
affected
by
its
safety
regulations
are
minimal.
i
don't
think
anybody
said
that
this
would
have
been
a
major
federal
action
requiring
an
environmental
impact
statement
if
there
were
nothing
involved
except
whether
these
safety
rules
are
going
to
cause
more
pollution
or
not.
your...
what
you're
using
to
require
the
eis
is
the
fact
that,
boom,
once
they
come
out
with
their
safety
rules,
floods
of...
of
mexican
trucks
come
into
the
country.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't...
don't
the
rules
have
to
be
such
that
american
trucks
and
mexican
trucks
are
treated
alike?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't.
would
it
be
a
good
reason...
i
mean,
i
take
it
you're
here
not
being
against
mexicans.
you're
against
environment.
unknown
speaker
so
if
in
fact...
yes.
i
mean
for
environment.
[laughter]
you're
against
bad
environment.
all
right.
we're
all
against
that.
now,
if
in
fact
it
turns
out
that
there
is
some
kind
of
problem,
is...
does
the
agency
have
the
power
to
say
if
there's
too
much
smoke
or
there's
too
much
bad
effect,
we
want
american
trucks
to
have
to
tighten
up
too?
we
don't
want
just
mexican
trucks
to
have
to.
we
want
everybody
to
have
to.
unknown
speaker
was
that
your
position
in
front
of
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
do
they
also
have
to
study
the
impact
of
the
american
trucks?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
but
i
mean,
here
you're
saying
that
this
350
requires
them
to
start
looking
at
all
the
smoke
and
so
forth
that
comes
up
from
the
mexican
trucks
because
their
safety
regs
could
have
an
impact
on
that.
well,
if
in
fact
the
overall
framework
of
this
inquiry
is
to
make
certain
that
we
don't
pollute
the
environment
or
that
we're
safe
in
a
context
where
mexicans
and
americans
are
to
be
treated
alike,
wouldn't
they
have
to
go
into
the
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
were...
were
these
points
pressed
on
the
agency
during
the
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
can
you
answer
yes
or
no?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
to
say
there
were
numerous
comments
about
safety
doesn't
certainly
answer
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well--
--so
your...
your
answer
to
my
question
is
no
i
guess,
that
you
did
not
press
on
the
agency
this
point.
you
say
the
agency
already
knew
it.
unknown
speaker
knew...
knew
what?
unknown
speaker
that...
that
high-risk
trucks
are
what?
more
polluting?
unknown
speaker
between
pollution
and
age.
unknown
speaker
and
was
that
brought
to
the
agency's
attention
as
one
of
the
things
that
they
should
take
into
account
in...
in
their
safety
rules?
unknown
speaker
the
agency
did
take
it
into
account
in
its
environmental
assessment
and
concluded
that
there
was
no
significant
environmental
impact
just
from
the
content
of
its
rules,
and
therefore
they
didn't
have
to
do
an
eis.
and
i...
i
had
thought
that
it
was
not
that
call
that
you're
challenging.
i
had
thought
that
what
you're
challenging
is
that
may
well
be
true,
that...
that
just
from
the
content
of
the
rules,
there's
no
significant
impact.
however,
the
rules
trigger
the
presidential
action
which
lets
in
the
mexican
trucks
and
that
is
the
significant
environmental
impact.
wasn't
that
the
accurate...
an
accurate
description
of
your
case?
unknown
speaker
not
the
choices
alone.
i
do...
i
do
not...
i
do
not
understand
you
to
have
claimed
that
purely
on
the
basis
of
what
safety
choices
the
agency
makes,
there
is
a
significant
impact
upon
the
environment
which
would
be
enough
to
trigger
a
requirement
for
an
eis.
is...
is
that
claim
made
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
can
you
point
to
that?
because
that...
to
me,
that's
what
your
answer
to
the
problem,
you
know,
with
the
decal
color.
it...
it
really
depended
on
that.
and
i
do
believe
that
they're
saying...
and
on
that
one,
it
seems
to
me,
look,
you
have
choice
a
at
the
agency,
b,
or
c,
and
this
is
more
polluting
than
that
and
the
other
isn't.
i
don't
see
why
they
wouldn't
have
to
write
an
eis
for
that.
but
i
think
that's
what
they're
saying
you
never
raised
before
the
agency.
so
could
you
tell
me
or
could
i
get
somewhere
or
is
it
in
here
the
place
that's
particularly
before
the
agency
where
all
this
was
gone
into
and
raised?
and
too,
where
it
was
raised
before
the
ninth
circuit.
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
but
that's
not
the
issue.
the
issue
really
is
the
agency
for
me.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
where...
where
before
the
agency
was
it
raised?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
are
you
saying
we
didn't
raise
it
before
the
agency?
the
reason
we
didn't
is
that
we
didn't
have
to.
all
we
had
to
do
was
raise
it
when
we
appealed
from
the
agency.
is
that
your
answer?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
if
that's
your
answer,
then
you
didn't
raise
it,
and
then
the
question
would
be
does
an
agency
have
to
have
figured
out
here
that
its
different
alternatives
in
front
of
it
might
have
had
differential
environmental
impacts
that
they
didn't
take
account
of.
now,
how
am
i
going
to
answer
that
question?
unknown
speaker
i
know
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--it's
yes.
i
want
to
know
what
i
read--
unknown
speaker
--and
try
to...
try
to
figure
out
whether
it
is
yes.
unknown
speaker
what...
what...
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did...
why
did
you
wait
until
the
petition
for
rehearing
in
the
ninth...
ninth
circuit
to
raise
it
before
that
court?
unknown
speaker
what...
here
is...
here's
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
dot's
assessment
that
its
regulations
will
cause
emissions
below
the
amounts
specified
in
40
c.f.r.
93
blah,
blah,
thus
excusing
it
from
making
a
conformitory
determination
is
based
on
the
predicted
emissions
in
its
ea.
as
we
have
already
determined,
however,
dot
failed
to
conduct
a
reliable
environmental
analysis
because
of
its
illusory
distinction
between
the
effects
of
the
regulations
themselves,
which
is
what
we've
been
talking
about,
and
the
effects
of
the
presidential
rescission
of
the
moratorium.
it
seems
to
me
it
was
essential
to
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
that
you
have
to
take
into
account,
before...
before
you
win,
the...
the
impact
of
the
president's
decision.
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
base
it
just
on
the
effects
of
the
regulations
themselves.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it's
true
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
just
what
you
said
it
said,
but
it
was
quoting
the
general
requirement,
i
think,
which
exists
in
the
way
you
describe
it.
and
here,
i
guess
the
question
is,
is
given
their
environmental
assessment,
had
they
failed
to
fulfill
that
requirement
and
so
it
would
require
somebody
to
point
out
to
them,
look
at
this
environmental
assessment.
this
environmental
assessment
is
not
adequate
to
fulfill
that
requirement
that
we
all
know
exists.
now,
what
about
that?
unknown
speaker
remember,
what
we're
talking
about
now
is
the
agency
is
considering
alternative
a,
b,
or
c.
they
all
involve
safety.
they're
likely
to
have
differential
impacts
on
smoke
and
so
forth.
and
now
they
have
in
front
of
them
an
environmental
assessment,
and
the
environmental
assessment
explains
to
them
why
they
don't
have
to
do
more
than
they've
done
in
respect
to
just
what
we're
talking
about.
everyone
agrees
that
the
requirement
is
what
you
said.
the
ninth
circuit
says
it.
who
told
the
agency
that
this
ea
is
inadequate
when
it
tells
you
you
don't
have
to
do
more
in
respect
to
that
to
assessing
one,
two,
and
three,
you
know,
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's--
unknown
speaker
--does
this
agency
have
the
authority
to
exclude
a
perfectly
safe
truck
because
in
its
view
it's
an
older
truck
and
will
pollute
more?
is
that
within
the
scope
of
what
the
agency
can
do?
unknown
speaker
safety
choices.
unknown
speaker
no.
it...
it
has
to
describe
the
environmental
effects
perhaps,
but
if...
if
it
does
not
have
any...
any
power
on
the
basis
of
environmental
effects
to
alter
the
safety
regulations...
i
mean,
two
trucks
are
equivalently
safe.
can
this
agency
say,
yes,
you're
both
just
as
safe,
but
as
a
safety
regulator,
i'm
not
going
to
let
you
in
because
you
pollute
more?
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
agency's
job
as...
as
a
safety
regulator.
unknown
speaker
that's
true,
but
it
has
to
exclude
it
on
the
basis
of
safety
considerations.
unknown
speaker
are...
are
you
saying
that
because
there
are
varying
environmental
effects
as
between
old
trucks
and
new
trucks,
the
agency's
obligation
is
to
find
a
safety
hook
in
order
to
keep
out
the
old
rather
than
the
new?
unknown
speaker
and
we'll...
we'll
find
that
the...
you
know,
the
signal
lights
don't
work
quite
so
well
on
the
old
trucks
and
we'll
use
that
as
a
basis
to
keep
them
out
so
there...
so
we
can
minimize
environmental
damage?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then...
excuse
me.
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
let's
assume
the
agency
concluded
that
on
all
significant
safety
factors,
the
old
trucks
are
just
as
good
as
the
new
trucks.
it
also
concluded
that
the
old
trucks
pollute
more.
there...
there
is
an
environmental
difference.
the
agency
cannot
keep
out
the
old
trucks
for
that
reason
alone.
my
question
is,
does
the
agency
have
to
prepare
an
impact
statement
saying
we're
letting
in
the
old
as
well
as
the
new,
but
in
letting
in
the
old,
we're
letting
in
more
highly
polluting
trucks?
do
they
have
to
prepare
that
statement
even
though
their
action
is,
and
legally
can
be,
the
same
with
respect
to
the
oldest
of
the
new?
unknown
speaker
suppose
under
justice
souter's
question,
the
agency
has
no
choice
and
it
must
let
in
the
trucks.
does
it
still
have
to
prepare
the
eis?
unknown
speaker
or
the
ea.
unknown
speaker
no.
but
you're...
you're
saying,
i
think,
suppose
the
agency
is
trying
to
choose
between
two
headlight
inspections
a
year
or
one.
all
right.
now,
if
you
have
two
a
year,
in
fact,
there
will
be
fewer
trucks.
if
you
go
to
one
a
year,
there
might
be
more
trucks
coming
in
and
then
you
will
have
more
pollution.
now,
if
that's
a
significant
difference,
then
i
guess
the
agency
does
have
to
go
into
it.
but
if
they
have
an
ea
that
tells
them,
you
know,
it's
not
that
big
a
deal
because
they're
going
to
be
about
the
same
number
of
trucks
regardless,
then
i
would
think
the
burden
would
be
on
the
environmentalists
to
show
that
that's
really
wrong.
and
i
think
that's
the
kind
of
argument
you're
making.
and
you're
telling
me
that
it's
so
obviously
wrong
that
even
though
you
didn't
raise
it
in
the
agency,
they
should
have
figured
it
out.
is...
is
that
where
we
are?
unknown
speaker
did...
did
you
challenge
the
regs?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
where...
where
are
you?
on
46?
8a,
page
8a,
isn't
it?
46
of
your
brief
or
where?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
were
relying
on
the
regulation
on
page
8a
of
the
government's
principal
brief.
that's
certainly
what
they
raised
in
their...
in
their
argument
here,
which...
which
makes
whatever
this
other
regulation
says
quite
irrelevant
because
it's
a
definition
of
emissions.
and
it
says
that
to
be
an
indirect
emission
within
the
act,
the
federal
agency
must
have...
must
be
able
to
practicably
control
and
maintain
control
over
the
emissions
due
to
a
continuing
program
responsibility.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
guess
that
any...
any
federal
licensing
agency
for...
for
automobiles
or
anything
else
would...
would
come
within
this
and
would
have
to...
you
know,
if
i
don't
issue
a
license,
i
can
practicably
control
the...
the
amount
of
emissions,
even
though
the
agency
is
not
a...
an
emissions
approving
agency.
it's...
it's
giving
driver's
licenses.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
weissglass.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
what...
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response
to
the
argument,
which
i
didn't
realize
they
were
making
independently,
that
just
based
on
the
agency's
available
choices,
it
could
have
made
the
safety...
have
different
safety
regulations.
that
was
a
sufficient
effect
on
the
environment
that
they
had
to
do
a--
unknown
speaker
--they're...
they're
making
basically
the
argument
you
said
they
waived.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
i
mean,
that's
been
pretty
much
our
whole
discussion.
and
i
think
on
that,
the
government
says,
well,
they're
right
in
principle.
they're
saying...
i
mean,
if
in
fact
an
agency
has
a
choice,
a,
b,
or
c,
and
if
you
choose
a,
there's
a
lot
of
smoke;
b,
a
little
smoke;
and
c,
no
smoke,
well,
they
ought
to
go
analyze
it
under
an
eis.
i
think
you
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying,
well,
they
never
made
that
point.
unknown
speaker
they
said,
but
it's
so
obvious
we
didn't
have
to
make
it,
and
besides,
when
we
got
to
the
ninth
circuit,
at
least
in
the
reply
brief,
we
did
make
it.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
what's
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
