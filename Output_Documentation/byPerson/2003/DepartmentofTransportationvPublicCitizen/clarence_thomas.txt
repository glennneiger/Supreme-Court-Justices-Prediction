justice
clarence
thomas
this
case
comes
to
us
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
since
1982,
there
has
been
a
moratorium
on
the
authorization
of
most
new
cross-boarder
operations
of
mexican
motor
carriers.
as
part
of
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement,
the
united
states
agreed
to
phase
out
this
moratorium.
after
the
president
made
clear
his
intention
to
lift
the
moratorium,
the
federal
motor
carrier
safety
administration,
which
i
will
refer
to
as
agency,
published
for
comment
two
rules
concerning
the
safety
regulations
of
mexican
motor
carriers.
congress
subsequently
passed
the
department
of
transportation
and
related
agencies
appropriation
act.
section
350
of
the
act
provided
that
no
funds
appropriated
under
the
act
of
the
expended
review
or
process
any
application
by
mexican
carriers
until
the
agency
implemented
a
particular
set
of
safety
regulations.
acting
pursuant
to
the
national
environmental
policy
act,
nepa,
the
agency
issued
an
environmental
assessment
for
its
proposed
rules.
i
will
refer
to
the
environmental
assessment
as
ea.
the
agency
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
its
ea
analysis
that
there
would
be
no
change
in
trade
volume
between
the
united
states
and
mexico
due
to
the
issuance
of
the
rules.
it
acknowledged
that
due
to
section
350,
no
mexican
motor
carriers
could
be
authorized
for
cross-boarder
operations
until
it
issued
the
regulations,
but
it
determined
that
any
increase
in
operations
would
result
from
the
president’s
modification
of
the
moratorium
not
from
its
regulations.
the
agency
concluded
that
the
issuance
of
its
rules
have
no
significant
environmental
impact
and
declined
to
perform
a
full
environmental
impact
assessment
or
eis.
by
the
way
there
will
be
a
quiz
on
all
of
the
acronyms
after
this.
and
also
that
it
did
not
need
to
perform
a
full
conformity
determination
for
its
regulations
under
the
clean
air
act
or
caa
and
various
implementing
regulations.
respondents
filed
petitions
for
judicial
review
of
the
rules
arguing
that
the
rules
were
promulgated
in
violation
of
nepa
and
the
caa.
respondents
argued
that
the
agency
was
required
under
nepa
and
the
caa
to
factor
into
its
analysis
the
environmental
effects
arising
from
the
increased
cross-boarder
operations
of
mexican
motor
carriers.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed,
set
aside
the
rules,
and
remanded
the
case
for
preparation
of
an
eis
and
a
full
conformity
determination.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
under
nepa,
an
agency
is
required
to
prepare
an
eis
only
if
it
will
be
undertaking
a
“major
federal
action”.
under
the
applicable
regulations,
a
major
federal
action
includes
those
actions
with
effects
that
may
be
major
and
which
are
potentially
subject
to
federal
control
and
responsibility.
so,
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
increase
in
cross-boarder
operations
of
mexican
motor
carriers
is
an
effect
of
the
agency’s
issuance
of
its
proposed
rules.
the
answer
is
no.
as
this
court
has
previously
held
a
but
for
causal
relationship
between
an
agency
action
and
an
effect
is
insufficient
to
make
an
agency
responsible
for
evaluating
that
effect
under
nepa.
instead,
something
analogous
to
proximate
causation
must
be
shown.
courts
must
look
to
the
underlying
policies
or
legislative
intent
of
nepa
in
order
to
draw
a
manageable
line
between
those
causal
changes
that
may
make
an
actor
responsible
for
an
effect
and
those
that
do
not.
here,
the
agency
could
not
prevent
the
increase
in
the
cross-boarder
operations
of
the
mexican
motor
carriers.
the
agency
is
required
to
register
as
a
motor
carrie
any
person
that
it
finds
is
willing
and
able
to
comply
with
established
safety
and
financial
responsibility
requirements.
for
this
reason,
none
of
nepa’s
purposes
would
be
advanced
by
requiring
the
agency
to
take
into
account
the
environmental
effect
of
the
increase
in
cross-boarder
operations.
finally,
the
agency
did
not
need
to
consider
the
environmental
impact
of
the
increase
in
cross-boarder
operations
in
deciding
whether
to
perform
a
full
conformity
determination
under
the
caa.
under
the
caa
and
the
applicable
regulations,
an
agency
must
determine
whether
its
actions
would
interfere
with
a
state’s
implementation
plan
if
its
actions
would
cause
an
increase
in
emissions
beyond
threshold
levels
established
by
the
epa.
an
agency
must
consider
both
direct
and
indirect
emissions.
since
the
emissions
from
the
mexican
trucks
would
not
occur
at
the
same
place
and
time
as
the
issuance
of
the
agency’s
rules,
they
are
not
direct
emissions.
and
since
the
agency
cannot
practicably
control
or
maintain
control
over
these
emissions,
the
emissions
are
not
indirect.
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
unanimous.
