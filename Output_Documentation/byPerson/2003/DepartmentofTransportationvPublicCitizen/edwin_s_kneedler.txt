mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
february
of
2001,
an
international
arbitration
panel,
convened
under
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement,
concluded
that
the
united
states'
continuation
of
a
blanket
ban
or
a
moratorium
on
the
operation
of
mexican
domiciled
commercial
carriers
beyond
the
border
zone
in
the
united
states
violated
nafta.
soon
thereafter,
the
president
made
clear...
excuse
me...
his
intention
to
comply
with
the
arbitration
decision
by
invoking
power
specifically
vested
in
him
by
congress
to
lift
the
moratorium
in
order
to
comply
with
an
international
trade
agreement.
and
the
president
in
fact
did
lift
the
moratorium
in
november
of
2002.
in
this
case,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
federal
motor
carrier
safety
administration,
an
agency
in
the
department
of
transportation
that
is
limited
to
a...
a
safety
mandate,
was
required
to
conduct
an
elaborate
and
complex
environmental
analysis
of
the
president's
foreign
trade
and
foreign
policy
decision
before
it
could
enter
or
issue
procedural
safety
regulations
that
were
necessary
to
implement
the
president's
decision.
the
ninth
circuit
set
aside
the
procedural
regulations
on
that
ground
and
thereby
prevented
the
agency
from
granting
certification
to
carriers
that
under
the
president's
decision
were
eligible
to
receive
it.
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
incorrect
and
it
has
frustrated
the
president's
ability
to
comply
with
nafta.
congress
and
the
president,
the
two
entities
whose
joint
action
brought
about
the
lifting
of
the
moratorium,
are
not
subject
to
either
nepa
or
the
provisions
of
the
clean
air
act
that
respondents
rely
on
to
require
an
environmental
analysis.
accordingly,
the
agency
acted
entirely
reasonably
in
choosing
to
take
the
president's
action
as
a
given,
including
any
increased
traffic
or
trade
that
might
occur
as
a
result
of
the
president's
decision
and
to,
instead,
focus
its
own
environmental
analysis
on
the
effects
of
its
own
procedural
regulations.
fmca's
government...
governing
statute
requires
it
to
grant
registration
to
any
carrier
that
is
willing
and
able
to
comply
with
applicable
safety,
safety
fitness,
and
financial
responsibility
requirements.
the
agency
has
no
authority
to
deny
operating
permission
to
a
carrier,
foreign
or
domestic,
based
on
environmental
concerns
or
foreign
trade
concerns.
it
has
no
authority
to
countermand
the
president's
decision
or
to
refuse
to
issue
the
regulations
that
were
necessary
to
implement
the
president's
decision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
was.
and...
and
soon
thereafter,
the...
the
moratorium
was
imposed
in
1982
originally,
but
it
conferred
on
the
president
the
power
to
lift
the
moratorium,
and
an
agreement
was
arrived
at
soon
thereafter
with
canada.
so
since
the
early
'80's,
canadian
carriers
have
been...
have
been
permitted
to
enter.
the...
the
moratorium
was
remained
in...
retained
in
effect
by
the
president
through
subsequent
actions
into
the
'90's.
in
the
north
american
free
trade
agreement,
the
united
states
included
a
reservation
to
a
complete
opening
of
the
border
for
transporter
operations
by
carriers
subject
to
a
phase-out,
initially
a
phase-out
that
would
allow
carriers
from
mexico
to
operate
in
any
of
the
border
states...
that
was
3
years
after
the
agreement
was
signed...
and
then
by
the
year
2000,
to
allow
the
carriers
to
operate
anywhere
in
the
united
states.
the
president
decided
not
to
go
forward
with
that
because
of
concerns
about
whether
the
safety
regulatory
regime
in
mexico
was
sufficient
to
prepare
the
mexican
carriers
to
come
into
the
united
states.
so
that
is
the
reason
why
it
was
held
up.
and...
and
the
basis
of
the
nafta
arbitration
panel's
decision
was
that
a
blanket
prohibition
on
that
ground
was
not...
was...
was
not
permissible
under
nafta
and
that
the
united
states
had
to
consider
applications
from
mexican
carriers
on
a
case-by-case
basis.
it
could
adopt
special
procedures
to
ensure
that
the
carriers
who
would
be
permitted
to
come
in
under
the
president's
lifting
of
the
moratorium
would
satisfy
the
substantive
safety
standards.
and
that
is
the
set
of
regulations
that
are
at
issue
here.
but
it's
important
to
recognize
that
these
are
not
substantive
safety
standards.
the
substance...
the
standards
that...
that
mexican
carriers,
like...
like
other
foreign
and
domestic
carriers
in
the
united
states
have
to
comply
with,
are...
have
already
been
in
place.
all
that
we
are
talking
about
here
are
essentially
procedural
or
administrative
regulations.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
yes,
yes.
and
it...
i
think
it's
the
same
situation.
the
fmcsa,
as
a
subordinate
agency
in
the
executive
branch,
i
think
would
have
to
take
as
a
given
that
act
of
congress
just...
just
as
it
was...
it
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
no.
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
same.
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
what
i...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no.
i...
i
misspoke.
[laughter]
i'm
sorry.
i
misspoke.
the
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
and...
and
for
very
similar
reasons,
that
that's
essentially
a
political
decision,
in
the
one
case
by
congress
in
your
example,
or...
or
by
the
president.
and...
and
that's
why
congress
traditionally
vests
an
authority
such
as
this
in
the
president
because
he
is
responsible
for
foreign
relations
and
foreign
trade.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's...
that's
correct.
it's
part
of
the
context
in
which
the
agency
is
operating,
but
it
would
be
presumptuous
of
the
agency
to
take
upon
itself
a...
a
determination
to
evaluate
or
to
second
guess
effectively
the
president's
determination.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
two
things
i'd
like
to
say
about
that.
the
first
one
is
that
the...
that
respondents'
claim
in
this
case
and
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
in
this
case
are
not
premised
on
the
sort
of
tinkering
with
the
application
and
monitoring
rules
that...
that
you
may
be
referring
to.
the...
the
premise
of
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
was
that...
that
the
president's
lifting
of
the
moratorium
was
foreseeable
and
therefore
fmcsa
had
to
evaluate
the...
the
much
broader
question
of
whether
mexican
trucks
should
be
permitted
to
come
in
at
all.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
as
to
your
second
point,
though,
that...
that
the
agency
might
have
been
able
to
refine
the
regulations
in
some
way,
that
is
not
an
argument
that
respondents
made
to
the
agency.
and
under
vermont
yankee...
and
this
is
critical
to
the
operation
of...
of
nepa
and
the
corresponding
clean
air
act
provisions
is
that
an
agency
can
only
evaluate
or...
or
identify
errors
if
they're
called
to
its
attention.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the...
the
first
place
that
this
point...
i
mean,
it
was
really
just
in
a
sentence...
was
in
a
reply
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
they...
that
they...
that
they...
they
said
that
the
agency
might
have
been...
been
able
to
come
up
with
some
modified
version
of...
of
the
regulations.
but
it's
not
very
realistic
to
think
that
what
the
agency
could
do...
could
permissibly
do...
could
have
a
significant
effect
on...
on
emissions
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
respondents
have
not
relied
on
that
provision,
but...
but
my...
my
understanding
of
that
is
that
that
refers...
that
refers
to
effects
that...
that
are
within
the
agency's
control.
the...
the
critical
point...
and
this...
this
is
reflected
in
the...
in
the
regulations
on
page
4a,
the
things
that
an
agency
is
responsible
for
taking
account
of
under
nepa,
are
direct...
things
that
are
directly
caused
or
indirectly
caused.
and
caused
is
the...
is
the
operative
word.
and
this
court
said
in
the
metropolitan
edison
case
that
it's...
that...
that
strict
but-for
causation
is
not
enough
under
nepa.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and...
and
i
was
just
going
to
say
there
is
a
separate
requirement
under
the...
ceq
has
elaborate
regulations
that...
that
flesh
this
out.
and...
and
ceq
has
a
regulation
that
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
and...
and
respondents
have...
have
abandoned
any
reliance
on
it,
which
is
that
an
agency
has
to
evaluate
cumulative
impacts.
it
has
to...
it
has
to
essentially
evaluate
the
incremental
contribution
that
its
own
action
will
make
toward
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
the...
the...
first
of
all,
the
agency
did
that.
it
evaluated
its
incremental...
its
incremental
impact.
what...
what
it
did--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it...
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
you
mean...
if
you
mean
with
the...
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
and...
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and...
and
what...
what
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the...
the
agency
here
was
the
only
one
taking
action,
and
all
the
cumulative
impact
requirement
requires
it
to
do
is
to
isolate
what
its
incremental
contribution
will
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if...
if
there
are--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
there
are...
if
there
are
two
agencies
working
in
tandem...
see,
the...
again,
the
president--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
president--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
two
agencies...
if
two
agencies
are
taking
parallel
action,
they
are
supposed...
or
coordinated
action,
they're
supposed
to
coordinate
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
right.
and...
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
is...
it
is...
it's
addressed--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--more...
it...
it
includes
more--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
not
just
limited
to
other
agencies,
but
there's
an--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
agency
did
comply
by
saying
this
is
the
context
in
which
we
were
acting.
what
they
said
is
we
have
no
control.
and
this
is
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--literally
the
language
there.
we
have
no
control
over
what
the
president
is
going
to
do.
it
projected...
it
projected
increases
in
traffic
or...
or
increases
in
trade
that
might...
might
result
or
discussed
that.
so
that's
really
what
the
cumulative
impact
analysis
requires
is
to...
for
the
agency
to
put
its
own
action
in
context.
but
where
the
agency's
own
action
is
marginal,
which
is
the
case
here,
it
can
be
expected...
these
are
basically
administrative
undertakings
by
the
agency,
application
forms,
and...
and
on-site
inspections.
that...
that
where
the
agency's
own
action
is
going
to
contribute
so
marginally
to
environmental
impacts,
the
rule...
the
general
rule
of
reason
under...
under
nepa
does
not
require
an
agency
to,
for...
for
example,
conduct
a...
a
nationwide
study
of
clean
air
act
possible
effects
of
mexican
trucks
in
order
to
determine
that
its
own
contribution
is
going
to
be
minimal.
and...
and
what...
what...
as
i
mentioned,
the
agency's
contribution
here
arises
simply
from
developing
an
application
form,
a...
a
preapproval
analysis,
on-site
analysis,
of...
of
the
carrier
in
mexico
in
most
cases,
or...
or
on
paper,
and
then
follow-up
monitoring
and
inspections.
and
the
only
real
contribution
to
emissions
that
any
of
that
would
have
are
the...
are
the
roadside
inspections
where
the
engine
might
be...
will
be
idling
a
little
bit
while
the
truck
is
inspected
and
the
agency
fully
evaluated
its
contribution
to
increased
emissions
for
that
and
concluded
that
they
would
be
negligible,
looked
at
in
that
way.
and
neither
the
ninth
circuit
nor
respondents
have
ever
challenged
that.
and
as
i...
as
i
mentioned,
although
the...
the
ninth
circuit
treated
the
president's
action
as...
as
a...
a
consequence
of
what
the
agency
did,
the
respondents
have
receded
from
that
position
as
well.
and
they
have...
they
have
relied
on
this
appropriations
provision,
section
350,
as
it's
been
referred
to
in
this
litigation,
which
required
fmcsa
to
do
certain
things
before
it
could
spend
any
money
to
approve
individual
applications
of
carriers
that
would
be
eligible
under
the...
under
the
president's
lifting
of
the
moratorium.
but
section
350
reinforces
our
position
because
it
reinforces
the
proposition
that
the
agency's
role
was
limited
to
safety
matters.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
there's
not...
there's
no
mention
of...
of
environment...
environmental
issues
in...
in
it.
and
in
fact,
what
it
did
is
it
further
constrained
fmcsa's
discretion.
whatever
discretion...
and
it...
and
it
overrode
or
made
more
strict
the
agency's
initial
proposed
regulations
by
requiring
safety
evaluations
in
mexico
and
stringent
evaluations
afterward.
it
added
some
very
strict
requirements
because
congress
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
agency
was
going
to
impose--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--stringent
qualifications.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
because
it...
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
kept
it...
the
duty...
the
duty
is
imposed
on
the
agency.
that's
the
way
it
has
been
understood.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
the
agency
shall
include
in
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
it
says
include
in
every...
the
agency
in...
in
the
introductory
part
shall
include
in
every
recommendation
or
report
on
proposals
or
major
federal
action.
i
think
it's
referring
to
its
own
proposal
for
a
major...
a
major
federal
action.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
that
this
court
has
ever
specifically
addressed
it,
but
i
think
that's
been
the
common
understanding.
and
i
think
it
follows
in
this
case
from
the
exemption
of
the
president
from...
from
nepa
at
all.
and
the...
i...
i
mentioned
before
that
section
350
serves
to
confine
the
agency's
discretion
here.
and
the...
the
agency's
decision
that
an
environmental
assessment
was
all
that
was
necessary
and
a
full-blown
environmental
impact
statement
was
not
required
is
reinforced
in
this
case
by
the...
by
decisions
of
a
number
of
courts
of
appeals
that
have
said
that
where
an
agency
does
not
have
discretion,
it
does
not
have
to
prepare
an
environmental
impact
statement
because
the
purposes
of
nepa
are
really
to
inform
the
agency's
own
decision-making
process
and
to
inform
the
public
so
it
can
participate
in
the
agency's
decision-making
process.
where
the
agency
essentially
has
no
discretion
about
whether
to...
to
go
forward,
as
the
agency
here
did
not,
then
to
require
a
full-blown
environmental
impact
statement
of...
of
clean
air
issues,
which
are
exceedingly
complex,
before
the
agency
would
go...
could
go
forward
would
not
further
the
purposes
of...
of
nepa
and
would
only
serve,
in
fact,
to
slow
down
the
process
of
complying
with
nafta.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
yes.
nepa
imposes
no
substantive
requirement.
but...
but
in
this
case
there
was
really
a
need
for
expedition,
and
it's...
and
that's...
that's
made
evident
here
by
the
fact
that
the
statute
that
authorized
the
president
to
lift
the
moratorium
provided
for
the
president
to
give
notice
and
allow
public
comment
for
that,
but
allowed
him
to
waive
that
where
expeditious
action
was
required.
and
when
the
president
lifted
the
moratorium
in
november
of
2002,
he
specifically
invoked
that
provision,
dispensed
with
further
opportunity
for
public
comment
because
he
determined
that
expeditious
action
was
required.
it's
very
much
like
this
court's
decision
in
crosby
several
terms
ago
in
that
way
because
the...
although
here
it's
a
subordinate
federal
agency
rather
than
a
state,
but
the
result
is
to
interfere
with
the
ability
of
the
president
to
respond
promptly
to
an
international
disagreement
that
had
arisen
out
of
a
foreign
trade
agreement.
i
did
want
to
spend
just
a
moment
on
the
clean
air
act
conformity
analysis
point
which
the...
the
conclusion
on
that
we
think
follows
directly
from
the
conclusion
on
nepa.
under...
under
epa
regulations
that
were
promulgated
in
1993,
respondent
doesn't
challenge
them
here,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
has
upheld
them.
under
those
regulations
an...
an
agency
is
required
to
conduct
a
conformity
analysis
and
to
conform
its
action
only
where
its
action
causes
emissions,
but
beyond
that,
where...
where
the
emissions
are
subject
to
the
agency's
practicable
control
and
where
the
agency
will
maintain
that
control
through
continuing
program
authority--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
that...
that...
and
that
regulation
is
set
forth
in
our...
in
our
brief
on
page
8a
of...
of
the
brief,
the
definition
of
the
term,
indirect
emissions,
which
elsewhere
is
described
as
the
emissions
for
which
the
agency
is
responsible.
and
in
this
case,
it's...
it's
very
clear
that
the
fmcsa
does
not
have
any
control
over
or
continuing
responsibility
for
the
president's
decision
to
lift
the
moratorium,
for
the
determination
of
whether
carriers
that
get
registration
will
actually
bring
trucks
into
the
united
states,
what
routes
they
will
travel
while
in
the
united
states,
and
what
emissions
they
will
have
once
they're
in
the
united
states.
those
are
all
things
that
are
beyond
the
agency's
control.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the...
the
regulations
are
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
the
agency
adopted
through
notice
and
comment
rulemaking,
and
the...
the
preamble
to
that
regulation
contains
a
very
extensive
and
persuasive
discussion
by
epa
about
why
it's
necessary
to
draw
a
line
between
the
things
that...
for
which
a
federal
agency
can
be
reasonably
held
accountable
or
responsible
and
those
for
which
the...
after
all,
the
states
are
primarily
responsible
in
developing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--implementation
plans.
and
one
of
the...
one
of
the
things
that...
that
epa
specifically
concluded,
that
it's
unrealistic
to
think
that
congress
meant
that
just
because
you
need
a
permit
at
the
very
outset...
we...
we
quote
this
in
our
reply
brief.
just
because
you
need
a
permit
to
do
something
should
not
render
the
agency
responsible
for
every
subsequent
thing
that
somebody
who
gets
a
permit
might
do,
get
a
driver's
license,
for
example,
doesn't...
yes,
it's
a
precondition
to
driving,
but
it
doesn't
mean
that
the
permitting
agency
should
be
responsible
for
evaluating
of
all
the...
all
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
suppose
under
the
broadest
reading,
but
i
think
even
that
might...
might
be
a
extensive
reading
of
the
regulation.
and
let
me
also
just
say
again
that
respondents
have
not
challenged
the
validity
of
the
regulation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
it...
it
could
voluntarily
do
that,
but
the...
but
the...
the
case
law--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
no,
it...
no,
it
would
not
follow
and...
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--nepa
has...
has
not
been
interpreted
that
way
over
the
years
where
an--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but
even
in
the
non-presidential
case
where
an
agency
does
not
have
discretion,
because
the
eis
is
designed
to
inform
the
agency's
decision-making
power,
and
if
it
really
has
no...
no
latitude
in
its
decision-making,
it
would
be
essentially
pointless
to
prepare
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
that's
true,
but...
but
we
do
think
that
there
is
some
room
for
remedial
discretion
where...
where
even
if
there's
a
violation,
the...
not
to
mention
the...
the
principle
of
prejudicial
error
under
the
apa
that
if
there's...
if
there's
a
defect,
it
doesn't
always
have
to
result
in
setting
it
aside.
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
several
things,
mr.
chief
justice.
the...
the
critical
point
here
is
that
the
agency
had
no
discretion
to
deny
certification
to
mexican
trucks
that
were
eligible
under...
under
the
president's
lifting
of
the
moratorium
if
they
satisfied
the...
the
requirement
that
they'd
be
willing
and
able
to
comply
with
the...
with
the
statutory
standards.
so
the
agency
was
really
acting
under
two
imperatives.
one
is
its
preexisting
organic
statute
and
then
secondly,
the
president's
lifting
of
a
moratorium
that
required
the...
the
government
to
live
up
to
its
obligations
under
nafta.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
did
not...
they
did
not...
what...
what
they're
really
arguing
is
that
the
agency
should
have
considered
some
other
alternative.
the
agency
analyzed
essentially
two
alternatives,
go
forward
under
our
existing
regulations...
again,
these
are
procedural,
not
substantive
regulations,
just
regulations
designed
to
identify
whether
carriers
satisfy
substantive
standards...
either
to
go
forward
under...
under
preexisting
or...
or
introduce
new
ones.
the
respondents
never
said
to
the
agency,
there's
a
third
alternative.
you
can
make
your
new
regulations
even
more
stringent
and
here's
what
you
could
do.
and
in
fact,
even
now,
they
don't
identify
what
further
strengths--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
well,
the
important
thing
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
the...
first
of
all,
the
agency...
the
agency
did
an
ea
in
order
to
determine
it
didn't
have
to
produce
an
environmental
impact
statement.
if
they
were
wrong
on
that,
that
should
have
been
called
to
their
attention
on
this
precise
point,
specifically
that
the
agency
should
have
adopted
an
even
more
stringent
alternative.
and
it's...
and
even
now,
they
don't
identify
one
that
the
agency
could
do
that
wouldn't
be...
essentially
be
a
pretext,
justice
souter,
as
you
were
suggesting,
that
would
be
consistent
with
their
duty
to
let
in
trucks
and...
and
still
have...
have
more
flexibility.
what
they
quote
for
this
is
on
page
193
of
the
joint
appendix
in
the
environmental
assessment.
it's
important
to
recognize
that
that
is
a
portion
of
the...
of
the
environmental
assessment
that
repeats
that
our
own
actions,
including
the
inspections,
are
not
going
to
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
environment.
but
even
so,
we
can...
we
can
mitigate
that
tiny
impact,
and
it's
in
that
context
where
the
agency
says,
we
can
try
to
screen
out
the
dirtier
trucks.
and
there's
a
reference
to
environment.
it's
unclear
what
it
means,
but
i
think
two
pages
later
the
court
identifies
that
there
could
be
leaks
from
a
truck
that
would
be
identified
during
an
inspection
they
could
turn
over
to
environmental
people
from
the
state.
so
it's
focused
on
a
very
narrow
question,
whether...
whether
the
inspections
would...
would
increase
the
emissions.
and
respondents
have
never
really
challenged
the
notion,
which
is
what's
being
addressed
here,
that...
that
the
increased
inspections
under
these
rules
would
have
an
impact
on...
on
the
environment.
i
did
want
to
address
the...
the
clean
air
act
regulations.
we
did
not
raise
the
regulation
that's
quoted
on
page
17
of
our
brief.
we
relied,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
on
the...
under
the
indirect
emissions.
as
i
mentioned,
the...
the
agency
has
no
continuing
control.
it
isn't
the
control
at
the
outset.
it's
control
over
the
subsequent
activities,
which
is
the
word
in
the
regulation,
and
the...
this
agency,
a
safety-certifying
agency,
has
no
continuing
control
over
where
these
trucks
will
travel
in
the
u.s.,
even
whether
the...
even
whether
the
particular
trucks
come
into
the
u.s.--
