mr.
jonathan
weissglass
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
gave
fmcsa
important
choices
to
make
about
safety
before
any
trucks
come
over
the
border
from
mexico.
those
choices
will
determine
which
trucks
come
in
and
how
many.
the
reason
for
that
is
because
as
the
safety
rules
are
made
more
stringent,
fewer
trucks
will
be
able
to
meet
the
requirements
and
those
that
do
will
be
newer.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
the
argument
is
that
because
congress
promulgated
section
350--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--no
trucks
can
come
in
until
the
agency
makes
these
safety
choices.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
that
is
correct.
and
in
addition,
the--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
the
question--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
the
only
question
is
whether
the...
first...
there
are
two
questions.
first,
whether
that
the
agency
has
control
over...
over
the
choices
that
it's
making,
and
second--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--if...
if
the...
if
the...
if
it
comes
down
to
foreseeability,
when
the
agency
takes--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
the
critical
point
is...
is
whether
the
agency
has
a
choice
about
the...
the
options
that
it
is
going
to
take.
if
the
agency
has
control
over
what
it's
going
to
do,
and
in
the
reasonably
foreseeable--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--right.
then...
then
the
question
just
becomes
foreseeability,
and
if
it's
foreseeable,
the
agency
then
has
to
take
account
the...
the
effects
of
the--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--in
that
situation,
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
but
that--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
the
reason
is
this.
in...
in
this
case
the
agency
has
significant
choices
to
make
about
safety.
congress--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--because
it's...
it's
what
congress...
it's
how
congress
set
up
the...
the
situation.
congress
said
that
no
trucks
come
in
until
the
agency
makes
these
choices
and
congress
gave
the
agency
discretion
about
those
choices
and
those
choices
will
determine
which
trucks
come
in
and
how
many
and
therefore
the
environmental
effects.
now,
just
because
the...
there
is...
there
is
another
actor
that
has
to
make
decisions
and
has
to
take
action
before
there
will
be
any
environmental
effects
does
not
remove
this
from
major
federal
action.
that's
the
robertson
case
that
this
court
decided
where
the
agency
has
to
decide
yes
or
no
to
issue
a
permit.
upon
issuing
the
permit,
nothing
will
happen
until
a
private
construction
company
builds
a
ski
resort.
that...
that
is...
that
is
what...
what
is
going
on
here.
the...
the
agency
has
this
significant
choice
to
make
about
what
to
do
in
its...
in
its
regulations,
and
once
it
makes
that
choice,
but
only
then,
will
the
trucks
be
over--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--i...
i
believe
this
was
the
basis
for
the
ninth
circuit
decision.
the
president
and
the
agency
have
separate
actions
to
take,
and
it's
not
that--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--it
really
is
very
similar
to
the
robertson
scenario.
the
construction
company
couldn't
take
any
action
until
they
got
the
permit.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
justice
scalia,
the...
the
difference--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
the
difference
here
is
that
the
agency
has
significant
choices
to
make
about
safety.
it
can
determine,
in
fact,
how
many
older
trucks
are
going
to
be
coming
in.
and
it's
the
older
trucks
that
are
more
polluting.
and...
and--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--but
that's
the
point
of
nepa,
that...
what
nepa
says
is
just
because
you
have
a
safety
agency
doesn't
mean
it
can
divorce
its
safety
considerations
from
the
environment.
it
doesn't
have
to--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--that's
part
of
it,
but
the...
but
it's
also
true
that
what
the
agency
does
can...
can
have
a
huge
effect
in
terms
of
how
many
trucks
are
actually
going
to
come
over.
even
if
you
assume
that
some
trucks
are
definitely
going
to
come
over,
what
the
agency
does
is...
is
going
to
have
a
big
effect.
the
agency
specifically
says
that
the
rules
are
going
to
target
high-risk
trucks...
and
this
is
from
the
environmental
assessment...
to,
quote,
bring
them
into
compliance
with
united
states
safety
and
environmental
laws.
the
agency
knew
that
there
was
this
correlation
between
safety
and
the
environment.
and
we're
talking
about
tens
of
thousands
of
trucks,
and
a
mexican
fleet
that
is
skewed
much
older
than
the
u.s.
fleet.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
i...
there's...
actually
the...
the
arbitral
panel
in
nafta
specifically
said
that
the
u.s.
could
treat
mexican
trucks
differently
than
u.s.
trucks
as
long
as
it
has
a
good
reason.
but
the
court
doesn't
even--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--we're
for
environment.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
yes.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the
agency
does
have
that...
that
power.
the...
the--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--if...
if
the
agency
takes
major
action
with
respect
to
emissions
of
u.s.
trucks,
yes.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
no,
because
the
agency
rulemakings
that
we
challenge
deal
solely
with
the...
with...
with
trucks
coming
over
from
mexico.
now,
if
they
were
to
do
a
rulemaking
about
u.s.
trucks,
then
that
might
be
an
issue.
but
this
is
relating
solely
to
mexico.
and...
and
there
are
numerous...
numerous
things
that
the
agency
can
do
that...
that...
about
safety
of...
of
trucks
coming
over
from...
the
border
from
mexico
that
will
cause
the
older
trucks
that
are
both
less
safe
and
more
polluting
not
to
be
able
to
come
in.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
the
agency--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
there
were
numerous
comments
to
the
agency
about
safety,
and
the
agency,
as
i
mentioned
before--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
the
agency
said
that
it
was
going
to
target
high-risk
trucks
to
be
in
compliance
with
safety
and
environmental
laws.
and
because
the
rules
only
deal
with
safety,
that's
a
concession
that
safety
choices
affect
the
environment.
nothing
else
needed
to
be
told
to
the
agency.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
right.
the
agency
knew
it
and
the
public
was
not
required
to
cause
the
agency
to
connect
the
dots.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the
agency
knew
that
there
was
a--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
the
agency
knew
that...
that
older
trucks
are
both
less
safe
and
more
polluting,
that
there's
a
correlation--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--and...
and
that...
and
it
specifically--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
the
agency
had
it...
said
it
in
its
environmental
assessment
and
what
i
just
said.
and
the
public
commented
that
the
older
trucks
are
more
polluting.
and
the
agency
admits
it's
a
matter
of
common
sense
that
the
older
trucks
are
less
safe.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
yes,
both
that
and
the
choices
that
the
agency
makes
which
will
determine
not
only
whether
any
trucks
come
in
but
how
many.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
we
absolutely
did...
did
make
that
claim
in...
in--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
start
with
the
ninth
circuit.
we
raised
it
in
our
reply
brief,
as
mr.
kneedler
said.
and
the
ninth
circuit
passed
on
it.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
okay.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
the
agency,
as
i
said,
agreed
there's
this
correlation
between
safety
and
the
environment.
there...
the
public
did
not
need
to
tell
the
agency
what
to
do
with
that
because
vermont
yankee
makes
it
an
obligation
of
the
agency
to
consider
every
significant
aspect
of
the
environmental
effects
of
its
action.
this
is
not
a
situation
like
in
vermont
yankee
where
someone
raised
an
issue
about
unchartered
territory
and
refused
to
clarify.
the
agency
has
an
affirmative
obligation
to
take
this
into
account
because
it
had
the
predicate
facts
in
front
of
it.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
you
said
it
much
better
than
i
could.
yes.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
because--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--yes.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
because--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--because...
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
because
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
193,
the
agency
admits
this
correlation,
and
it
was
also
record
evidence
before
the
agency
that
the
mexican
fleet
is
much
older
than
the
u.s.
fleet,
that
the
older
trucks
are
more
polluting.
and
so
it
stands
to
reason...
and...
and
this
is
what
the
agency
has
to
do
when
it's
considering
environmental
effects
is
look
at
what
its
safety
choices
are
going
to
do
in
terms
of
the
environment.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
it
wasn't
rehearing.
it
was
on
a
reply
brief.
it
was
in
response
to
the
agency's
admission
in
its
opposition
brief
that
the
stringency
of
the
standards
does
have
this
effect.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
and
the
ninth
circuit
also
said
that
the...
the
environmental
assessment
was
inadequate
for,
quote,
not
considering
additional
alternatives
such
as,
for
example,
proposing
more
stringent
controls
on
incoming
mexican
trucks.
the
ninth
circuit
clearly
recognized
that
there
was
this
correlation
between
a
stringency
of
the
rules
and
the
environmental
effects.
now,
it's
very
important
to
understand
that
the
way
congress
set
this
up
was
it's
not
that
the
agency
is
somehow
overriding
a
presidential
decision.
there
are
two
separate
and
independent
decisions
here.
the
president
has
authority
over
trade
issues
the
way
congress
gave
him
that
authority.
but
the
congress
at
the
same
time
said
that
the
agency
has
authority
over
safety
issues.
these
are
two
separate
things.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
the
agency--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--issued
the...
the
environmental
assessment
and
then
asked
for
comment
on
it
after
it
had
already
issued
the
interim
final
rules.
there
were
comments
to
the
agency,
and
as
i've
said,
they
didn't
specifically
say
this.
but
the
agency
was
challenged
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
that
issue
was
raised.
and
that
is
enough
because
the...
the
agency
had
before
it
all
the
predicate
facts
to
take
into
account
the
relationship
between
the
stringency
of
the
safety
rules
and
the
environment.
it
knew
the
effects
of
its
actions.
it
specifically
said
that
high-risk
trucks
are
both
more...
more
polluting
and
less
safe.
it
had
to
do
that.
that's
what
nepa
requires.
nepa
doesn't
require
a
citizen
to
come
in
and
tell
the
agency
what
its
options
are.
it
requires
the
agency
to
take
that
action.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the
agency
is
to
make
safety
choices.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
and
in
doing
that
it's...
under
nepa
must
take
a
hard
look
at
the
environmental
effect
on
the
safety
choices.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
the...
the
agency
is
not
required
to
let
any
truck
in.
the
agency
is...
must
register--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--that
is
correct.
and
in
looking
at
the
safety
considerations,
what
it's
going...
what
it
is
going
to
promulgate
for
the
broad
class
of
trucks,
not
each
individual
truck...
it
is
promulgating
a
broad
class
of
safety
regulations.
any
truck
that
meets
that
standard,
yes,
the
agency
must
let
in.
but
in
deciding
what
that
standard
should
be,
that
general
standard,
the
agency
not
only
can,
but
has
an
obligation
to
look
at
the
environmental
effects--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the...
no.
the
agency
does
not...
does
not--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--the
agency
does
not
have
that
obligation
because
nepa
does
not
require
substantive
decisions.
but
what
nepa
requires
is
that
the
agency
take
a
look
at
those
effects.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
yes,
as
long
as
the
agency
has...
has
a
significant
choice
to
make
about
what
the
standards
should
be.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
if
the
agency
has
no
choice--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--then...
then
under
a
number
of
circuit
court
cases,
which
the
government
cited,
the
agency
would
not
have
to
do
it.
and
that's
an
open
question
for
this
court,
but
the
court
doesn't
need
to
reach
it.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
that...
i
think
that
is
accurate
about
where
we
are.
and...
and
the
fact
is
that
there
were
numerous
comments
to
the
agency
about
the
safety
things
that
it
should
have
done
and
didn't,
and
there
are
numerous...
there's
numerous...
there's
a
lot
of
room
between
the
standards
that
are
being
imposed
on
trucks
coming
over
the
border
from
mexico
and
the
standards
that
are
in...
on
u.s.
trucks.
the
agency
could
have
made
choices
that
would
affect
this,
that
would
affect
the
safety,
and
that
would
also
affect
the
environment.
and
the
agency
concedes
that.
the
agency
concedes
it
had
the
discretion,
and
it
concedes
that
this
could
affect
the
environment.
what
the
agency
does
is
say
that
that's
all
about
the
president
because
the
president
lifted
the
moratorium.
but
where
that
is
a
mistake
is
because
congress
was
the...
was
the
body
that
said
when
trucks
can
come
over,
and
it
gave
both
the
president
and
the
agency
separate
authority
over
that.
so
it
all
goes
back
to
congress
in
making
this...
this
foreign
commerce
decision.
now,
before
i
finish
my
argument,
i
did
want
to
talk
about
the
clean
air
act
because
this
is
very
important.
justice
souter
raised
this
point.
the
way
the
agency
reads
the
regulations,
it...
it
would...
it
would
be
completely
out
of
accord
with
the
language
of
the
statute
which--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--we...
we
did
not
challenge
the
regs,
but
we
read
the
regs--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--no,
because
we
read
the
regs
very
differently
than
the
agency.
the
agency...
the...
the
way
the...
the
particular
regulation
reads
is
that
it's
not
just
where--
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
--actually
the...
the
critical...
the
critical
regulation
that
the
government
raised
was
in
its
reply
brief.
it's
on
page
17
of
the...
of
the
reply
brief.
and...
and
there
is
the
definition
of
continuing
program
responsibility
because
once
the...
the...
you
get
past
the
cause
point...
and
epa
is
very
clear
that
under
the
clean
air
act,
it's
but-for
causation.
it
says
that.
and
so
we
clearly
have
that
here.
then
the
question
is
whether
the
agency
has
a
continuing
program
responsibility.
and
there
are
two
sentences
that
are
separate
formulations
of
when
there
is
that
responsibility.
the...
the
government
relies
solely
on
the
first
sentence,
which
we
do
not
rely
on.
that's
when
an
agency
requires
some
activities.
but
the
second
sentence
is
the
critical
sentence,
which
is
when
an
agency,
quote,
takes
actions
itself
or
imposes
conditions
that
result
in
air
pollutant
emissions.
well,
in
this
case,
the
agency
is...
is
taking
action
and
imposing
conditions
that
are
going
to
result
in
emissions
because
under
350,
no
trucks
come
in
at
all
until
the
agency
makes
these
choices
and
because
in
making
the
choices,
it's
imposing
conditions
that
are
going
to
be
absolutely
determinative
as
to
what
the...
the
pollutants...
how
much
pollution
there's
going
to
be.
if
the
agency
ratchets
up
its...
its
controls,
there's
going
to
be
less
pollution.
the
agency
admits
that.
mr.
jonathan
weissglass
that's
right,
and
the
regulation
i've
just
read
is
the
definition
of
continuing
program
responsibility.
the
agency
clearly
has
a
continuing
program
responsibility
here
because
as
it's
enforcing
the
regs
that
it...
that
it
writes,
it's
going
to
determine
how
much
pollution
there
is.
and
it
clearly
practicably
controls
the
emissions
