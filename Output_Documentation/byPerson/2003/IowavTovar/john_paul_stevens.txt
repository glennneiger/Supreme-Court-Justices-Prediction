justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
do
agree
that
he's...
you
do
agree
that
the
advice
should
include
explicit
advice
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
at
the
plea
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
doesn't
have
to
be
told
by
the
judge
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
at
the...
he
was
not...
this...
in
this
case
he
was
not
told
by
the
judge
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
at
that
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why...
why
is
it
clear
that
it
would
be
for
this
hearing
because
the
judge
followed
up,
after
saying
that,
did
you
want
to
represent
yourself
at
today's
hearing,
which
would
seem
to
me
to
imply
that
the
judge
did
not
know
whether
or
not
he
had
already
decided
not
to
have
counsel
at
that
hearing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
not
clear
on
this
record,
though.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
draw...
draw
presumptions,
maybe
it
is.
you
presume
everything
was
regular.
why
sure,
then
it
is.
but
if
you
just
look
at
what
was
said
to
him
at
the
hearing
itself,
it's
not
clear
that
he
knew
that
he
had...
he
had
waived
application
for
a
court-appointed
attorney.
he
didn't
necessarily
say
he
wanted
to
represent
himself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the...
all
i'm
saying
is
the
record
doesn't
establish
it,
and
we've
been...
in
some
situations
been
rather
meticulous
about
what
ought
to
be
on
the
record
because
then
you
solve
all
the
problems
of
collateral
attack
if
the
record
does
disclose
it
rather
than
relying
on
presumptions
and
inferences.
that's
the
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stewart,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you're...
you're
arguing
not
only
are
these
warnings
not
constitutionally
mandated,
you're
also
saying
they're
probably
unwise
in
a
number
of
situations.
are
you
arguing
that
they're
so
unwise
that
we
should
tell,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
a
state
judge
could
not
give
these
warnings?
