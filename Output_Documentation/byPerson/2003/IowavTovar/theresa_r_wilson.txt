ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
before
a
court
may
accept
a
guilty
plea
from
an
uncounseled
defendant,
the
constitution
requires
that
the
defendant
be
advised
of
the
following:
of
his
right
to
have
counsel
present
prior
to
and
during
entry
of
the
guilty
plea,
including
appointed
counsel
if
necessary;
that
by
waiving
counsel,
he
will
lose
an
independent
opinion
of
his
case
and
on
the
wisdom
of
pleading
guilty;
and
that
by
waiving
counsel,
he
risks
overlooking
potential
defenses
that
he
as
a
layperson
may
not
recognize.
these
are
the
minimal
standards
required
for
a
waiver
of
plea
counsel.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
the
iowa
supreme
court
applied
the
rules
of
patterson
and
faretta,
determining
that
a
uncounseled
defendant
who
chooses
to
plead
guilty
must
be
given
a
meaningful
discussion
regarding
the
usefulness
of
counsel
at
the
plea
proceeding
and
the
dangers
of
proceeding
pro
se.
the
court
determined
that
the
best
way
to
fulfill
that
obligation
is
to
advise
the
defendant
of
the
risks
of
overlooking
potential
defenses
and
of
the
loss
of
an
independent
opinion
regarding
his
case.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
yes.
we
simply
cannot
infer
from
the
fact
that
a
defendant
is
told
that
he
has
counsel
or
has
a
right
to
counsel
that
he
necessarily
understands
the
sort
of
assistance
counsel
could
provide.
the
american
bar
association
has
discussed
this
particular
problem
in
their
criminal
justice
standards,
specifically
part
5,
8.1.
the
american
bar
association
recognizes
that
to
many
defendants
the
word
counsel
may
not
necessarily
have
any
clear
meaning.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
not
necessarily.
under...
under
patterson,
under
faretta,
even
as...
back
as
far
as
johnson
v.
zerbst,
this
court
has
required
that
any
waiver
of
a
constitutional
right
be
a
voluntary,
knowing,
and
intelligent
abandonment
or
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
or
privilege.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
the...
those
particular
warnings
were
used
both
in
the
miranda
case
and
in
the
patterson
case,
sixth
amendment
right
to
counsel
at
post-indictment
questioning.
in
both
of
those
cases,
a
defendant
still
has
other
alternatives
even
if
he
does
make
statements
to
the
police.
he
can
attempt
to
recant
his
statement.
he
may
have
other
available
defenses.
if
a
defendant
appears
before
a
court
to
enter
a
guilty
plea
uncounseled,
that
admission
is
going
to
be
conclusive
proof
of
guilt,
leading
to
a
final
conviction
that
isn't
revocable.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
he...
the
defendant
would
have
been
able
to
file
a
motion
in
arrest
of
judgment.
i
do
not
recall
off
the
top
of
my
head
if
that
deadline
had
passed
by
the
time
of
his
sentencing.
i
believe
it
needs
to
be
filed
within
5
days
of
sentencing.
so
he
may
not
have
been
able
to
do
that
procedurally.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
the...
the
discussion
that
the
court
had
with
mr.
tovar
was
very
abbreviated
at
the
arraignment.
at
the
time
the
court
gave
its
discussion,
i
see
you're
appearing
here
today
without
counsel,
do
you
wish
to
proceed
pro
se,
the
district
court
had
no
idea
whether
mr.
tovar
was
going
to
enter
a
plea
of
guilty
or
not
guilty.
and
unfortunately,
a
defendant
in
that
situation
may
come
into
a
court
believing
that
he
does
not
have
a
right
to
counsel
simply
because
he's
going
to
plead
guilty.
nothing
that
district
court
would
have
told
him
up
to
that
point
would
have
dissuaded
him
from
such
a
belief.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no,
and
i
do
want
to
address
that.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
i
am
indicating
that
the
record
simply
doesn't
show
whether
the
defendant
had
any
knowledge
of
the
right
to
plea
counsel,
and
unfortunately--
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
--it
is
and...
and
the...
the
state
did
say
that
this
issue
was
not
addressed
in
the
iowa
supreme
court.
and
it
may
be
an
error
on
my
part
i
did
not
raise
it
as
a
denial
of
counsel
case.
but
in
fact,
in
the
brief
filed
before
the
iowa
supreme
court
and
the
iowa
court
of
appeals,
i
did
raise
the
fact
that
mr.
tovar
was
not
informed
that
he
had
a
right
to
plea
counsel,
that
the
only
discussion
of
the
right
to
counsel
at
that
plea
hearing
was
in
the
context
of
the
right
to
counsel
at
trial
he
was
waiving.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
the...
the
reason
that
the
issue
of
whether
he
was
informed
of
plea
counsel
is
important
is
because
that
is
the
first
requirement
for
a
valid
waiver
of
counsel.
the
first
requirement
is
an
intentional
relinquishment
of
a
known
right.
this
means
that
a
defendant
must
be
made
aware
that
he
has
a
constitutional
right.
according
to
miranda
v.
arizona,
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
is
to
tell
the
defendant
that
he
has
the
right.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
yes.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
yes.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
that...
that
is
an
option
for
the
court,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
again,
it...
it
was
raised
below.
unfortunately,
the
iowa
supreme
court
did
not
directly
address
it.
and
it
is
part
of
the
waiver
analysis.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
no,
your
honor.
there...
there's
no...
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
this
court
couldn't
do
that.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct,
your
honor,
but
the...
the
point
at
which
the
iowa
supreme
court
did
decide
is...
is
still
a
valid
point,
that
regarding
whether
there
needs
to
be
a
brief
discussion
regarding
the
usefulness
of
counsel
and
the
dangers
of
proceeding
pro
se.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
and
then
the
appropriate
response
from
the
court
would
be,
i
can't
advise
you.
i'm
not
your
attorney.
if
you
believe
anything
i've
said
here
raises
some
doubts,
speak
with
an
attorney.
otherwise,
we
could
proceed
with
the
guilty
plea
if
you
wish.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
it
at
least
indicates
that
the
defendant
has
been
given
some
warning
regarding
how
an
attorney
may
assist
him.
and
again,
the...
the
aba
says
that
the
fact
that
you
just
merely
tell
a
defendant
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel,
it
doesn't
necessarily
help.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
that
was
at
the
sentencing
hearing.
mr.
tovar
did
make
an
application
for
court-appointed
counsel
that
was
denied
because
he
was
dependent
upon
his
parents
as
a
college
student.
this
case
essentially
falls
into
a...
a
gap
between
patterson
and
faretta.
both
of
those
cases
require
some
discussion
regarding
the
usefulness
of
counsel
and
the
dangers
of
proceeding
pro
se.
the
iowa
supreme
court
attempted
to
fill
that
gap
by
requiring
these
particular
admonishments.
but
these
admonishments
reflect
the
core
responsibility
of
defense
counsel
at
a
plea
proceeding
and
also
are
responsibilities
this
court
has
recognized
in
previous
cases.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
specific
litany?
no.
i
do
believe
pennsylvania
rules
do
provide
a...
a
six-point
litany,
i
believe.
but
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
the
brief
filed
by
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender...
yes...
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association
in
this
case
that
outlines
the
various
requirements
in
both
the
circuits
and
the
states.
the
majority...
about
half
of
the
jurisdictions
in
this
nation
have
not
discussed
this
particular
issue,
waiver
of
counsel
at
a
plea
proceeding.
of
those
that
have,
the
majority
have
either
required
or
preferred
a
faretta
type
colloquy
for
waiver
of
counsel
at
a
plea
proceeding.
all
the
federal
circuits
that
have
discussed
this
issue
have
applied
that
standard.
18
states--
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
--have
either
required
or
preferred
a
discussion
of
the
dangers
of
proceeding
pro
se
at
a
plea
proceeding.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
it...
the
failure
to
use
those
particular
standards
may
create
a
rebuttable
presumption,
but
the
other
factors
in
the
case
may
show
that
a
defendant
did
validly
understand
or
did
understand
the
right
to
counsel.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
federal
circuits.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
i...
i
believe
so.
i
believe
the
ninth
circuit
did.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
i
can't
remember
off
the
top
of
my
head.
again,
i
would...
i
would
direct
the
court's
attention
to
that
brief.
only
10
states
that
have
considered
this
issue
do
not
require
a
faretta
type
colloquy.
some
of
those
do
use
the...
the
plea
colloquy.
but
i
guess
it...
it's...
this
issue,
though
it
hasn't
been
directly
addressed
in
the
brief,
but
obviously
it's
a
concern
of
the
states
whether
this
may
have
retroactive
effect
or
whether
it's
prospective
effect
as
far
as
its
effect
on
recidivist
statutes.
mr.
tovar
would
argue
that
these
standards,
if
adopted,
could
be
applied
prospectively
because
they
do
create
a
new
rule.
although
they
are
certainly
inspired
by
patterson
and
by
faretta,
these
particular
admonishments
are
not
required
by
those
cases,
and
again,
those
cases
do
not
address
the
particular
context
of
a
plea
proceeding.
it--
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
--correct.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
it
was
a
cooperative
effort
between
my
office
and
the
national
legal
aid
and
defender
association.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
i...
i
can't
honestly
answer
that,
your
honor.
but
even
assuming
other
jurisdictions
do
not
use
these
particular
standards,
the
burden
upon
the
state
will
be
alleviated
for
a
number
of
reasons.
first,
if
for
example,
iowa
wanted
to
use
a
guilty
plea
from
another
jurisdiction
for
enhancement,
a
defendant
would
have
the
burden
of
proof
on
a
collateral
attack.
if
these
standards
were
not
used,
that
may
create
a
presumption
that
the
waiver
was
invalid.
however,
the
state
could
certainly
attempt
to
prove
the
validity
of
the
waiver
through
other
means.
in
addition,
if
the
other
jurisdiction
does
not
use
these
standards...
some
of
the
claims
are
simply
going
to
be
time-barred.
for
example,
in
iowa
after
direct
appeal,
there
is
a
3-year
window
of
opportunity
for
a
defendant
to
apply
for
post-conviction
relief.
so
mr.
tovar,
who
did
not
apply
for
a
direct
appeal
of
his
guilty
plea
and
did
not
for
a
post-conviction
relief,
would
be
time-barred
from
challenging
it
now.
the--
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
--do
you...
can
you
rephrase
the
question.
i'm
not
quite
sure.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
i...
i
would
assume
so,
your
honor.
there's
also
a
procedure
in...
in
iowa
law,
iowa
rule
of
criminal
procedure
2.19(9)
that
would
actually
permit
a
defendant
to
challenge
the
use
of
that
prior
conviction
prior
to
the
sentencing
enhancement.
now,
the
state
may
have
an
argument
if
he
did
not
do
that.
then
the
argument
would
be
waived.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
it
depends
on
the
particular
statute,
justice
ginsburg.
in...
in
iowa
for
the
owi,
it's
12
years.
for
domestic
abuse,
it's
6
years.
for
harassment,
it
is
10
years.
there's
habitual
offender
sentencing
enhancement
that
does
not
contain
any
deadline
for
use
of
prior
convictions.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
third
offense.
it's...
the...
the
particular
sentence
in
this
case
was
180
days,
all
but
30
suspended,
and
a
$2,500
fine.
the
maximum
permitted
by
statute
would
be
5
years
in
prison.
also,
i
do
want
to
address
a
point
that
i
believe
justice
kennedy
raised
earlier
regarding
how
counsel
may
have
been
useful
here
given
that
he...
given
that
mr.
tovar
received
the
mandatory
minimum
for
a
conviction
in
his
1996
guilty
plea.
it
is
true
mr.
tovar
did
receive
the
mandatory
minimum
for
his
conviction
for
owi
first.
unfortunately,
under
the
statute
in
effect
at
the
time,
mr.
tovar
also
would
have
been
eligible
for
a
deferred
judgment.
this
is
something
apparently
the
prosecutor
did
not
offer
to
mr.
tovar
and
it's
something
the
district
court
did
not
advise
him
regarding.
it
is
something
that
had
counsel
been
present,
it
would
have
benefitted
mr.
tovar
who
would
have
been
a
prime
candidate
for
a
deferred
judgment.
also,
i
want
to
address
the
contention
that
a...
the
factual
basis
discussion
inherent
in
a
guilty
plea
helps
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
is
pleading
guilty
to
the
correct
crime.
unfortunately,
that's
not
always
the
case
and
i
can
provide
an
analogy.
defendant
is
charged
with
forgery
for
writing
checks
on
another
person's
account.
the
district
court
holds
a
factual
basis
colloquy
with
the
defendant,
asks
the
defendant
did
you
make
out
these
checks,
and
before
doing
this,
advises
the
defendant
that
it
cannot
accept
his
guilty
plea
unless
it
has
a
factual
basis
to
support
the
conviction.
the
court
asks
the
defendant,
did
you
make
out
these
checks?
defendant
says,
yes.
minutes
of
testimony
don't
indicate
whether
he
signed
his
name
or
the
other
person's
name.
the
defendant
himself
does
not
say
at
the
guilty
plea
whether
he
signs
his
name
or
the
other
person's
name.
under
iowa
law,
in
order
to
be
guilty
of
forgery,
a
person
must
do
an
act
purporting
to
be
the
act
of
another.
if
defendant
signs
his
own
name
to
that
check,
it's
not
forgery.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct,
but
unfortunately--
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
--um-hum.
and
unfortunately,
in...
in
the
situation
of
an
uncounseled
defendant,
as
in
that
case,
the
defendant
wouldn't
know
that
he's
not
legally
guilty,
that
there
was
no
factual--
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
--no.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
there
may
have...
in
an
owi
case,
your
mostly
likely
defenses
are
going
to
be
suppression,
implied
consent.
mr.
tovar
didn't
make
any
of
those
challenges
in
this
case.
he
may
have
had
them.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
we're
not
attempting
to
make
defendants
change
their
mind.
what
mr.
tovar
and
the
iowa
supreme
court
is
hoping
to
do
is
to
ensure
that
a
defendant
knows
exactly
what
they're
getting
into
when
they
plead
guilty,
that
they
know
that
they
have
the
availability
of
counsel
and
the
basic
services
counsel
can
provide,
and
therefore
they
will
be
pleading
guilty
uncounseled
with
their
eyes
open.
the...
the
plea
colloquy
suggested...
or
the
waiver
colloquy
suggested
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
is
not
unduly
burdensome.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
it
is
doubtful
that
these...
these...
well,
i'll
rephrase
that.
the
colloquy
suggested
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
is
certainly
not
going
to
prevent
anyone
from
pleading
guilty.
the
state
speaks
of
the
defendant
who
wants
to
expeditiously
accept
responsibility.
that
person
is
more
than
likely
going
to
plead
guilty
regardless
of
the
length
of
the
colloquy
given
by
the
court.
however,
what...
the
only
person
that
may
possibly
be
deterred
by
this
sort
of
a
colloquy
is
the
defendant
who's
already
experiencing
doubts
as
to...
to
his
decision
of
whether
to
plead
guilty.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
absolutely,
your
honor,
because
the
district
court
isn't
necessarily
required
to
tell
the
defendant
such
things
and
we're
seeing
in
cases
like
lockyear
v.
andrade,
ewing
v.
california
where
petty
offenses,
because
they
are
tied
in
with
recidivist
statutes,
are
creating
life
sentences.
and
it
would
make
sense
to
have
an
attorney.
if
we're
going
to
have
this
robust
system
of
recidivist
statutes,
then
we
should
also
have
a
robust
system
of
safeguards
to
ensure
that
a
defendant's
due
process
rights
are
protected.
the...
the
plea...
the
waiver
colloquy
suggested
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
is
not
going
to
inhibit
the
plea
process.
again,
it's
adding
a
few
lines
to
the
colloquy
that's
already
required
for
the
acceptance
of
guilty
pleas.
furthermore,
such
a
standard
would
actually
assist
the
state
in
the
long
run.
these
standards
places
the
waiver
colloquy
on
the
record
for
all
to
see.
this
assists
not
only
the
initial
court
in
making
the
waiver
decision
as
an
initial
decision,
but
it
also
assists
any
future
court
that
may
have
to
make
a
determination
of
the
validity
of
the
waiver.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
yes.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
they
could
do
that.
ms.
theresa
r.
wilson
correct.
it
was
making
an
interpretation
of...
of
patterson
and
faretta
to
the
plea
context.
that's
correct.
but
for
all
these
reasons,
we
would
respectfully
request
that
this
court
affirm
the
decision
of
the
iowa
supreme
court.
