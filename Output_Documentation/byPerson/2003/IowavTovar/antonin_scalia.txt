justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
wasn't
the
basis.
i...
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
basis
of
our
decision
here.
the...
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
did,
indeed,
focus
on
whether
he
was
advised
at...
about
how
useful
counsel
could
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in...
in
connection
with
the
guilty
plea--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
that
he
wasn't
advised
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
the
problem
here
is
he
was
told
he
had
a
right
to
counsel,
but
it
wasn't
said,
boy,
you
know,
you'd
really
be
stupid
to
turn
it
down.
that...
that
wasn't
done.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
doesn't
have
to
be
told
that
counsel
would
be
helpful.
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe...
maybe
you...
you
should
say
that
he
should
be
advised
of
his
right
to
counsel,
but
if
he
isn't,
it
is
a
harmless
mistake
if
it
is
clear
from
the
record
that
he
knew
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
even...
even
if
there
is
a...
a...
an
absolute
right
to
have
the
judge
tell
you
you're
entitled
counsel,
if
it's
clear
on
the
record
at
least
that
you
were
told,
there's...
there's
no
foul.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
you
knew.
justice
antonin
scalia
this...
this
being?
this
being
the
issue
on
which
we
granted
cert
or
the
issue
of
whether
you
have
to
advise
him
of
his
right
to
counsel?
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
ms.
wilson,
you
know,
as
to
how
much
that
requires,
when
we
invented
the
miranda
warning,
we...
we
simply
required
that...
that
the
defendant
be
told
you
have
a
right
to
counsel.
we
didn't...
we
didn't
say
that
he
be
told,
and
by
the
way,
the
first
thing
counsel
will
tell
you
is
to
shut
up,
which
would
be
very
good
advice.
[laughter]
we
didn't
require
that.
we
just
said
you
have
a
right
to
counsel.
and...
and
you
want
us
to...
to
elaborate
upon
the
miranda
warning
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
send
it
back.
do
we
usually
do
that,
send...
say,
you
know,
search
the
record
for
other
possible
failures
of
the
lower
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
haven't
been
raised
and
then
send
the
thing
back?
justice
scalia
but
the
attorney
is
going
to
cost
me
$200
an
hour.
give
me
a
break.
let
me
know
whether
it's
going
to
be
worth
it
or
not.
and
the
judge
will
say,
sorry,
i
can't
say
anything
about
that.
justice
scalia
you
ought
to
know
that
attorneys
are
useful.
that's...
that...
do
you
think
that's
a
considerable
help?
you
ought
to
know
that
attorneys
are
useful?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
be
the
judge's
fault
then
in...
in
not
assuring
that
he
was
aware
of
all
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
all
you're
saying
is
the
judge
can
make
a
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
mean,
even
if
we
grant
what
you
want
in
this
case,
judges
will
still
be
able
to
make
mistakes.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
doesn't
make
a
mistake,
he
would
know
all
the
elements
of
the
crime.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask?
like
the
chief,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
that
as
a
matter
of
public
policy
i...
i
even...
even
like
what...
what
you're
suggesting
even
if
it
were
made
very,
very
simple.
that
is
to
say,
we've
gone
through
the
elements
of
the
crime
and
you
acknowledge
that
you've
committed
all
of
them.
what
you
ought
to
know,
however,
is
that
if
you
got
an
attorney,
he
might
find
some
gimmick
that
would
allow
you
not
to
be
convicted
of
this
crime
even
though
you
have
committed
it.
you
should
know
that
because
it's
your
right,
you
know,
to
know
that
you
can
get
off
even
where
you're
guilty.
now,
is
this
something
that
we
really
want
to
encourage?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
long
as
you've
told
the
individual
these
are
the
elements,
are
you
sure
you
did
it,
why...
why
isn't
that
all
that
the
state
should
require?
we
want
to
encourage
people
to...
to
confess.
we
want
to
encourage
people,
when
they're
guilty,
to
pay
what
used
to
be
called
their
just
debt
to
society.
why
do
we
want
to
encourage
them
to...
to
hire
a
lawyer
so
that
they'll
get
off
on
a...
on
an
irrelevancy?
