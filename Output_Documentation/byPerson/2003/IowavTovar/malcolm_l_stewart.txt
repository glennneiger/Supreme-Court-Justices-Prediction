mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
plea
colloquy
conducted
at
respondent's
1996
prosecution
adequately
informed
respondent
of
the
dangers
and
disadvantages
of
proceeding
without
counsel.
respondent's
waiver
of
counsel
and
the
guilty
plea
itself
were
therefore
knowing
and
intelligent.
the
judgment
of
the
iowa
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
i
think
it
may
be
helpful
to
look
first
at
the
precise
language
that
the
iowa
supreme
court
employed
in
announcing
the
warnings
that
it
thought
were
constitutionally
required,
and
if
the
court
looks
at
page
18
of
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition,
that's
the
paragraph
of
the
iowa
supreme
court's
opinion
that's
entitled
summary
and
disposition.
and
it--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--of
the
appendix
to
the
certiorari
petition.
and
if
you...
if
you
look
in...
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
summarizing
its
holding
said,
rather,
the
trial
judge
need
only
advise
the
defendant
generally
that
there
are
defenses
to
criminal
charges
that
may
not
be
known
by
lay
persons
and
that
the
danger
in
waiving
of
the
assistance
of
counsel
in
deciding
whether
to
plead
guilty
is
the
risk
that
a
viable
defense
will
be
overlooked.
the
defendant
should
be
admonished
that
by
waiving
his
right
to
an
attorney,
he
will
lose
the
opportunity
to
obtain
an...
an
opinion
on
whether
under
the
facts
and
applicable
law
it
is
wise
to
plead
guilty.
in
addition,
the
court
must
ensure
the
defendant
understands
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
and
the
range
of
allowable
punishments.
but
the
third
paragraph
is...
is
more...
the
third
sentence
is
more
or
less
irrelevant
because
there's
no
dispute
here
that
the
defendant
was
informed
of
the
nature
and...
of
the
charge
and
the
applicable
punishments,
and
that
would
be
done
in
any
standard
plea
colloquy.
so
it's
really
just
the
precious
two
sentences
that
are
at
issue,
and
i
think
there
are
some
noteworthy
points
about
these.
the
first
is
that
the
warnings
mandated
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
don't
contain
any
declarative
sentence
to
the
effect
that
you
have
a
right
to
represented
by
counsel
at
this
plea
proceeding.
the
iowa
supreme
court
i
think
took
it
as
given
that
respondent
had
been
made
adequately
aware
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
and
that
what
was
missing
was
adequate
information
about
the
services
that
counsel
could
perform
in
connection
with
the
plea
decision.
the
second
thing
is
that
there's
no
reference
in
these
warnings
to
case-specific
issues
such
as
possible
suppression
of
evidence
or
the
potential
for
plea
bargaining.
the...
the
warnings
are
designed
to
be
warnings
that
could
be
given
in
every
single
case.
and
in
our
view,
the
warnings
are
either
vacuous
or
misleading,
depending
on
how
they're
interpreted.
if
they
are
accurately
interpreted
as
generalizations
about
the
criminal
justice
process,
they
really
say
nothing
more
than
that
as
a
class
lawyers
know
more
about
the
law
than
people
who
are
not
lawyers,
and
it's
at
least
possible
that
consulting
with
a
lawyer
would
improve
your
chances
in
this
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
think
any
defendant
who
is
aware
that
he
has
the
right
to
counsel
would
be
aware
of
those
facts,
would
be
aware
of
at
least
the
possibility
that
a
lawyer
could
help
him
and
the
certainty
that
a
lawyer
would
know
more
about
the
charges
than
he
would.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
defendant
misunderstands
these
warnings
as
directed
to
him
personally
as
availed
suggestion
that
there
is
actually
a
meritorious
defense
in
his
own
case,
then
the
defendant
may
be
given
an
artificial
disincentive
to
plead
guilty
and
in
the
case
of
a
non-indigent
defendant
may
be
led
to
spend
his
own
funds
consulting
with
a
lawyer
when
in
fact
no
valid
defense
exists.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it
would
be
constitutionally
sufficient,
but
it's
certainly
better
practice
to
make
sure
that
the
defendant
understands
that
the
right
extends
beyond
the
questioning
itself.
and
i
think
that
was
done
in
the
initial
appearance.
the
defendant...
there's...
there's
a
form.
the
defendant
is
represented
as
having
waived
his
right
to
application
for
appointed
counsel.
i
suppose
that
still
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
he
could
have
retained
counsel
if
he
had
chosen
to.
but
i
think
that
certainly
apprised
the
defendant
of
the
right...
of...
of
the
fact
that
his
right
to
counsel
extended
beyond
the
initial
questioning
itself
and
would
continue
for
the
duration
of
the
proceedings.
and
we'd
also
point
out
that
because
this
is
a
collateral
challenge,
the
defendant
bears
the
burden
of
establishing
that
no
knowing
and
intelligent
waiver
occurred.
and
to
the
extent
that
there's
a
gap
in
the
record
on
this
point,
i
think
the
defendant
is
properly
chargeable
with
that.
i'd
also
like
to
return
to
the
point
that
justice
kennedy
made
earlier
about
the
possibility
that
in
some
cases
an
attorney
might
be
able
to
obtain
suppression
of
incriminating
evidence
or
might
be
able
to
negotiate
with
the
prosecution
about
possible
plea
bargains.
i
think
first
it's
noteworthy
that
the
standard
rule
11
colloquy
mentions
several
constitutional
rights
that
an
individual
gives
up
by
pleading
guilty,
but
it
doesn't
mention
the
possibility
of
suppressing
evidence
and
it
doesn't
mention
the
possibility
of
plea
bargaining.
so
it
would
be
odd
to
think
that
you
could
have
a
constitutionally
valid
waiver
even
though
the
defendant
was
not
informed
of
those
substantive
possibilities
but
would,
nevertheless,
have
to
be
informed
of
the
assistance
that
a
lawyer
might
provide
in
connection
with
those--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
as
to
the...
it
does...
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
11
in
its
current
form
says
that
if
the
defendant
appears
at
the
plea
hearing
without
counsel,
he
is
to
be
informed
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
at
trial
and
at
every
other
stage
of
the
proceedings.
so
there's
clearly
a
requirement
that
the
defendant
be
made
aware
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
at
the
plea
hearing.
neither
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
nor
the
bench
book
for
u.s.
district
judges
requires
that
the
defendant
be
given
additional
information
about
the
services
that
an
attorney
might
provide
or
the
likelihood
that
an
attorney
could
be
helpful
by--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--my
sense
is
that
there
is
probably
a
great
deal
of
variation
not
only
from
state
to
state,
but
among
different
courts
within
different
states
i
think,
and
i
think
that's
probably
the...
the
likelihood
in
the
federal
system
as
well.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
we
would
assume
that
any...
necessarily
any
layperson
would
be
aware
of
the
potential
for
suppressing
evidence
or
the
possibility
of
negotiating
a
plea
arrangement.
i
think
any
defendant
knows
more
generally
that
lawyers
have
legal
expertise
that
lay
people
lack.
but
i
think
if...
if
we
try
to...
to
think
about
how
warnings
about
suppression
and
plea
bargaining
might
work,
i
think
we
realize
why
the
iowa
supreme
court
shied
away
from
something
like
that
because,
on
the
one
hand,
if
this
court
instructed,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
whenever
an
uncounseled
person
pleads
guilty,
he
has
to
be
informed
that
in
some
cases
it
may
be
possible
to
suppress
incriminating
evidence
and
in
some
cases
it
may
be
possible
to
negotiate
with
the
prosecution
for
a
reduced
charge,
a
lot
of
defendants
are
going
to
be
given
false
hope
because
the
possibility
that
those
modes
of
procedure
might
succeed
would
vary
enormously.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i...
i
think
those
rules
really
do
focus
on
things
that
will
actually
happen
in
any
criminal
trial
if
the
defendant
decides
not
to
plead
guilty.
that
is,
the
defendant
is
informed
if
you
plead
guilty,
you
are
waiving
the
right
either
to
testify
or
not
testify
on
your
own
behalf.
you're
giving
up
the
right
to
counsel.
you're
giving
up
the
right
to
cross-examine
witnesses.
the
defendant
really
is
being
told
about
things
that
are
likely
to
occur
in
virtually
any
criminal
trial,
and
i
think
that's...
that's
the
idea
of
a
standardized
plea
colloquy.
on...
on
the
other
hand,
if
you're
talking
about
suppression
of
evidence
or
talking
about
plea
bargaining,
if
you
give
that
advice
in
every
case,
it's
often
going
to
be
misleading.
a
trial
judge
is
going
to
find
himself
in
the
position
of
saying
you
might
be
able
to
bargain
with
the
prosecution
over
a
reduced
charge
even
though
he
knows
that
the
policy
of
the
prosecutor
is
not
to
engage
in
plea
bargaining
with
respect
to
a
category
of
cases
that
includes
that
one.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
federal
law
barrier
to
states
requiring
warnings
such
as
these.
and
i...
i
think
the...
the
vacuous
warnings,
the
warnings
we
regard
as
vacuous,
that
were
mandated
by
the
iowa
supreme
court
are
less
likely
to
be
harmful
than
more
specific
warnings
about--
but
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
is
if
the
court
decided
that
it
wouldn't
be
a
good
idea
to
warn
about
suppression
of
evidence
or
plea
bargaining
in
every
case
but
maybe
it
would
be
advisable
to
do
that
in
some
cases,
that
would
really
be
thrusting
trial
judges
in
an
untenable
position
because
the
point
of
having
a
standardized
plea
colloquy
is
to
give
judges
a...
a
safe
harbor,
to
give
them
some
assurance
that
if
they
provide
standardized
advice
in
every
case,
that's
going
to
be
enough.
and
if
a
trial
judge
had
to
decide
is
the
likelihood
of
a
successful
plea
negotiation
sufficiently
great
in
this
particular
case
that
the
defendant
should
be
advised
about
it
or
do
i
see
a
viable
basis
for
asking
for
suppression
of
evidence,
it
would
really
make
the
trial
judge's
life
much
more
difficult.
and
if
the
court
were
to
hold,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
the
trial
judge
is
required
to
do
that
and
can
be
reversed
for
failure
to,
it
would
really
cause
disruption.
