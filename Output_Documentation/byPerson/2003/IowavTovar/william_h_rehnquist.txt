we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
02-1541,
iowa
v.
felipe
edgardo
tovar.
general
miller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this...
this
comes
after,
i
take
it,
general
miller,
the
discussion
between
the
judge
and
the
defendant
as
to
whether
or
not
the
elements
of
the
offense
are
present?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
and
if...
if
the
defendant
represents
to
the
court
that
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea
is
there,
that
he
committed
the
offense
charged,
why
is
there
any
great
interest
in
trying
to
persuade
him
not
to
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
did
this
case
come
out
of?
a
justice
court?
it
was
a
misdemeanor,
wasn't
it,
an
owi,
operating
without
a--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
miller.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
ms.
wilson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that...
that
isn't
what
the
supreme
court
of
iowa
required
in
this
case,
is
it?
i
mean,
the...
their
warning,
as
read
by
mr.
stewart,
was
not
nearly
that
specific.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
they
say
how
they
knew
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
judgment
is
entered
only
after
the
sentence,
i
would
assume.
is
that
correct
in
iowa?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're...
all
of
this...
it
goes
back
to
a
prior
conviction
not
his
most
recent
one
i
take
it,
and
all
the
facts
we're
talking
about
were
at...
those
associated
with
the
prior
conviction,
not
this
more
recent
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
we
do
it
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
didn't
cross...
as
justice
souter--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
didn't
cross-petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
put
it
in
your
brief
in
opposition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
in
this
case
that
the
judge
told
the
defendant
he
was
not
entitled
to
free
counsel
because
he
was
dependent
on
his
parent
where
he
was
going
to
ames
or
something
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
applied
that
standard.
you
mean
imposed
it
as
a
constitutional
requirement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
preferred,
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
did
the...
you're
talking
about
now
federal
courts
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and...
and
they
held
this
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
other
circuits?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
your
brief,
ms.
wilson...
let
me
make
sure
i've
got
the
right
one.
yes.
in
your
table
of
authorities,
you
have
a
number
of
cases
from
this
court
and
then
you
have
a
number
of
state
cases
which
seem
to
be
mostly
iowa
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
you
don't
cite
any
federal...
federal
cases
such
as
the
ones
i
presume
you
were
referring
to.
was
there
some
reason,
if...
if
they
support
you,
why
you
didn't
put
them
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
which
one
dropped
the
ball?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
what
if
under...
under
iowa
law
you
have
a
case
like
the
present
one?
when
this
case...
the...
tovar
pleaded...
rather,
he...
he
pleaded
not
guilty.
he
went
to
trial,
didn't
he?
and
supposing
that
the
prior
conviction
is
4
years
old,
can
he
not
challenge
that
under
iowa
law
when
he
appeals
as...
as
an
enhancing
factor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
what...
what
i'm
concerned
with,
take
the...
the
present
case.
the
defendant
pleads
not
guilty,
goes
to
trial,
the
jury
finds
him
guilty.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
one
of
the
bases
for
sentencing
is
that
4
years
ago
he
pleaded
guilty
to
a
similar
crime
but
didn't
get
these
waivers.
under
iowa
law,
could
he
challenge
that
4-year-old
conviction
as
an
aggravating...
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
on
appeal
from
his
present
conviction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'll
ask
you
the
same
question
i...
i
asked
of
general
miller.
if
in
fact
the
defendant
here,
mr.
tovar,
says,
yes,
i
was
guilty
of
driving
under
the
influence
and
i
know
that
the
test
said
that
and
i
don't
disagree
with
it,
what
public
policy
is
there
to
try
to
get
him
to
change
his
mind
because
you
might
have
suppressed
some
of
that
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
wilson.
general
miller,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
miller.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
iowa
versus
tovar
will
be
announced
by
justice
ginsburg.
