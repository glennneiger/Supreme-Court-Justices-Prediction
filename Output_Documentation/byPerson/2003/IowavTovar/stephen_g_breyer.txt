justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
goodness,
he
wasn't
told.
you're
conceding
that
he
wasn't
told
he
had
a
right
at
the
plea
stage.
i
thought
what
they
said
to
him
right
off
the
bat
was,
mr.
tovar,
you're
without
counsel.
i
see
you
waived
application
for
a
court-appointed
attorney.
you
want
to
represent
yourself
at
today's
hearing.
so
what
i
thought
the
state
was
saying
is
that
that's
sufficient.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
didn't
even
think
that
was
an
issue
in
this
case.
i
didn't
see
it
in
the
petition.
i
didn't
see
it
in
the
response
to
the
petition.
maybe
it
would
be
an
issue
for
the
lower
court.
so
i'm
not
sure
what
to
do
with
that.
i
can
see
it's
ambiguous,
but
if
you
want
to
concede
it,
that's
fine
with
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
nobody
is
really...
at
least,
is
that
an
issue
in
front
of
us?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
your...
what
everybody
i
think
is
trying
to
do
is
ask
you
what
is
your
argument
on
the
point
that
we
thought
was
why
we
granted
the
case,
or
at
least
i
thought
why.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what...
what
is
the
reason
that
the
iowa
court
is
wrong--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on...
on
the
point
just
as
justice
scalia
put
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
they
say...
did
they...
i
mean,
i'm...
i
am
impressed
by
the
fact
that
rule
11(b),
which
is
a
product
of
the
rulemaking
process
and
presumably,
i'm
sure,
it
reflects
the
experience
of
trial
lawyers,
which
is
not
my
experience,
and...
and
they
try
to
get
in
things
like
the
aba.
yet,
they
do
not
require
that
you
tell
the
lawyer
how
useful...
you
tell
the...
the
individual
how
useful
the
lawyer
will
be.
they
do
require
that
you
tell
the
defendant
how...
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer
at
every
stage
of
the
proceeding.
so
i
took
from
the
fact
that
the
aba
and
everybody
else
lobby
nonstop
for
this
kind
of
thing
that
they
felt
it
was
very
desirable
but
not
so
important
that
you
had
to
actually
include
it
in
the
colloquy.
otherwise,
it
would
be
there
in
rule
11(b).
so
now,
what...
what
does
the
aba
say?
do
they
say
it's
a
constitutional
requirement?
do
they
try
to
change
even
the
rule?
no.
i
don't
think
they
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're...
you're
saying
that
the
constitution
requires
the
thing
that
the
lawyers
themselves
through
their
groups
have
felt
is
desirable
but
not
important
enough
to
put
in
the
rules.
wouldn't
we
go
to
the
rules
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
we
agree
with
you
about
that,
the
thing
to
do
is
send
it
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
they
can
decide
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
we
can't
decide
it.
i
mean,
we
could
decide
it
but
i
guess
it's
not
really
fairly
raised,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
guess
if
we
just...
what
we'd
normally
do
here
is
we
say...
suppose
we
didn't
agree
with
your...
on
your
basic
argument.
we
say,
well,
you
lose
on
that
one.
now
we
send
it
back
from
appropriate
proceedings,
whatever
is
appropriate.
i
don't
know.
at
that
point,
i
guess
you'd
go
back
to
the
iowa
court
and
you'd
say
you
didn't
address
this
other
issue
which
i
had
in
my
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
reason
we
can't
do
that?
i
don't
know.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
think
it
would
be
valuable
in
california
to
have
somebody
there
to
say,
by
the
way,
this
is
the
second
time
you've
stolen
a
chicken
and
if
you
plead
guilty
and
do
it
again,
you
may
go
to
jail
the
rest
of
your
life?
or
if
you're
in,
say,
alaska,
this
seems
to
be
an
assault
case
but
it's
connected,
in
fact,
with
the
charge
of
sexual
assault.
so
if
you
plead
guilty,
the
rest
of
your
life
you're
going
to
have
to
be
registered
as
a
sex
offender.
or
to
say,
for
example,
if
you're
immigrant,
you
know,
it
may
not
seem
to
be
important
to
you
because
it
just
happened
to
be
hitting
your
child
or
something,
you
know,
a
slap
or
something
like
that,
but
you're
going
to
be
deported
likely
if
you
plead
guilty.
would
it
be
useful
to
have
a
lawyer
there
to
tell
them
that?
