justice
souter
you
don't
think
he
has
to
know
that
counsel
would
be
helpful.
justice
david
h.
souter
my...
i
guess
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with
that
is
no...
no
question
about
the...
the
soundness
of
those
general
statements,
but
they
are
so
general
that
they...
they
raise
the
question
whether
there
are
really
very
many
defendants
that
don't
know
that
to
begin
with
and
whether
there
is
a
real
utility
in
requiring
those
warnings
and
hence
paying
the
price
in
the
mistaken
cases
when
they're
not
given.
do...
do
defendants
really
need
this?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
that's
not
an
issue
in
this
case,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
you...
you
didn't
cross
petition
and
you
didn't
raise
this
in
the
brief
in
opposition
i
take
it.
