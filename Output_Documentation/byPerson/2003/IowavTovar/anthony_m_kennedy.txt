well,
but...
but
in...
in
the
context
of
entering
a
plea,
it
certainly
would
be
useful
for
the
defendant
to
know
that
if
he
had
an
attorney,
the
attorney
might
take
a
look
at...
at
the
sobriety
tests.
he
might
talk
with
the
prosecutor
about
a
plea
to
the
lesser
charge,
reckless
driving.
he
might
talk
to
the
judge
about
a
reduced
sentence.
it
didn't
happen
here
because
he
got
the
minimum.
but
just
as...
as
a
general
matter,
your
brief
seems
to
suggest
that
there's...
there's
not
really
much
role
for
the
attorney
at...
in
entering
a
guilty
plea.
i...
i
suggest
that
there...
there's
a
very
important
role
for
him.

and
collateral
consequences,
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i
think
there's
something
important
afterwards.
it's
or
did
you
want
to
take
some
time
to
hire
an
attorney
to
represent
you,
which--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--certainly
one
inference
is
that
to
represent
you
at
this
kind
of
proceeding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
a
miranda
warning
be
sufficient
to
advise
the...
the
defendant
that
you
have
a
right
to
counsel?
period.
it's
pretty
obvious
to
me
that
if
you
have
a
right
to
counsel
at
interrogation,
you
certainly
have
a
right
to
one
at
the
plea
bargain.
would
that
be
sufficient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
suppose
my
comment
was
in
response
to
the
argument
that,
well,
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference,
which
is
the...
the
intimation
i...
i
saw
in...
in
the
brief.
and
i
suppose
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
because
we
assume
that
anybody
knows
this
stuff?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
why
wouldn't
the
same
argument
apply
to
all
of
the
rights
that
you're
going
to
lose
if
you
plead
guilty?
why...
why
wouldn't
rule
11
be
really
largely
unnecessary
under
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
was
the
sentence
imposed
in
this
case
for
the...
for
the
third
offense?
