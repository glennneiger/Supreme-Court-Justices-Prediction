justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
it
was
very
much
the
issue
before
the
iowa
supreme
court
because
that
court
said
what
was
missing
here
was
information
about
the
utility
of
a
lawyer
at
the
plea
stage
before
you
enter
the
plea
with
you
at
that
hearing.
and
here,
all
of
the
statements
made
relate
to
what
you're
giving
up
by
pleading
guilty
and
not
going
to
trial.
now,
i
thought,
as
justice
breyer
did,
from
that
opening
colloquy
there
was
information
to
the
defendant
that
he
could
consult
with
a
lawyer
before
entering
the
plea.
and
i
wondered
particularly
about
the
form
that
he
signed.
tovar
signed
a
form
waiving
counsel
before
the
plea
hearing,
but
that
form
is
nowhere
in
the
record
or
the
lodging.
does
it
exist?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
we
have
the
transcript
of
the...
of
that
initial
hearing
where
he
waived
counsel?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
that
was
basically
the
rule...
what
would
be
in
the
federal
system,
a
rule
11
colloquy,
and
it's
all
canned.
i
mean,
the...
as
the
transcript
shows,
he...
he
went
through
the...
almost
precisely
the
same
litany
on
both
times.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
does
have
a
right
to
counsel
at
the
plea
hearing.
he
does
have
a
right
if
he
asserts
it
to
consult
with
counsel
before
the
hearing
takes
place,
but
i...
i
think
your
argument
is
he
doesn't
even
have
to
be
told
that
bare
information,
never
mind
the...
the
continuing
spiel
about
how
much
a
lawyer
would
be
worth
to
him,
but
just
the
simple
statement
before
you
enter
this
plea,
you're
entitled
to
consult
a
lawyer.
and
if
you
want
a
lawyer
to
be
with
you
at
the
hearing,
you're
entitled
to
that
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
was
at
the
sentencing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that...
that
was
not
said
at...
at
his
plea
hearing.
that
was
said
at
his
sentencing
hearing
when
he
pled
to
another
crime
that
he
had
committed
in
the
interim.
but
at...
the
lines
of
what
went
on
at
the
plea
hearing
is
i
see,
mr.
tovar,
you
waived
application
for
a
court-appointed
attorney.
did
you
want
to
represent
yourself
at
today's
hearing?
period.
that
was
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
states
seem
to
take
various
positions
on
this.
do
you
know
if
any
of
them
have
taken
it
as
a
matter
of
their
own
constitution
rather
than
the
federal
constitution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
iowa
hasn't,
but
have
other
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why...
even
on
this
very
record,
when
he
came
for
the
sentencing,
the
judge
did
say,
as
judge
kennedy...
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
that
are
you
sure
you
don't
want
more
time
to
consider
having
counsel.
and
one
of
the
questions
i
was
going
to
ask
you
is
given
that
the
judge
was
so
solicitous
at
the
sentencing
hearing,
could
the
defendant
at
that
point
have
said,
judge,
i've
thought
about
what
i
did
at
the
plea
hearing
and
i'd
really
like
to
withdraw
my
plea?
justice
ginsburg
i
think
you're
right.
i
need
more
time
to
consult
a
lawyer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it...
it
just
seemed
to
me
that
a
judge,
being
so
solicitous
about
this
crime
that
didn't
carry
any
jail
time,
would...
would
certainly
say
the
one
that
does
carry
jail...
jail
time,
yes,
you
think
you
want
to
talk
to
a
lawyer?
it's
okay.
we'll
hold
it
in
abeyance
and
you
talk
to
your
lawyer.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the...
the
court
usually
remands
for
proceedings
not
inconsistent
with
this
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
and
if
the
court
just
addresses
what's
before
them,
whether
the
sentences
that
mr.
stewart
read
to
us
whether
the...
if
the
court
decides
it,
that's
not
what
the
constitution
requires,
then
it
vacates
or
reverses
and
remands
and
iowa
could
take
it
from
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
do
you
deal
with
the
question
that
was
posed
that
it
raises
a
false
hope,
and
if
you
tell
a
defendant
a
lawyer
might
know
defenses
that
you
don't
know,
but
wouldn't
the
defendant
then
ask
the
judge,
judge,
would
you
please
tell
me
what
those
defenses
might
be?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
limit
on
how
many
years
back
you
go
for
enhancing
prior
convictions?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
this
case...
this
case
i
don't
think
you
can
raise
any
such--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--thing
because
it
was
a...
a
blood
alcohol
test
that
did
him
in,
and
he
didn't
dispute
the
results
of
that
test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
the
iowa
supreme
court
thinks
so,
it
could
put
it
in
the
iowa
rules.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that...
that's
how
it
would
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case,
the
iowa
supreme
court
is
projecting
what
would
be
law
for
the
nation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
sixth
amendment
secures
the
criminal
defendants
who
face
incarceration
the
right
to
counsel
at
all
stages
of
the
criminal
process.
that
right
includes
counsel's
aid
prior
to
entering
a
guilty
plea.
the
iowa
supreme
court
in
the
case
before
us
held
that
the
sixth
amendment
requires
the
trial
court
to
give
defendants
who
seek
to
plead
guilty
unaided
by
counsel
two
specific
admonitions:
first,
that
foregoing
the
aid
of
counsel
entails
the
risk
that
a
tenable
defense
will
be
overlooked,
and
second,
that
an
uncounseled
defendant
loses
the
opportunity
to
gain
an
independent
opinion
on
whether
it
is
wise
to
plead
guilty.
we
hold
that
neither
warning
is
mandated
by
the
sixth
amendment.
the
constitutional
requirement
is
satisfied
when
the
trial
court
informs
the
accused
of
the
nature
of
the
charges
against
him
of
his
right
to
be
counseled
regarding
his
plea
and
of
the
range
of
allowable
punishments
attendant
upon
the
entry
of
a
guilty
plea.
the
defendant
respondent,
felipe
edgardo
tovar,
was
charged
in
1996,
again
in
1998,
and
for
a
third
time
in
2000
with
driving
under
the
influence
of
alcohol
in
iowa
code
owi,
operating
while
intoxicated.
he
pled
guilty
in
1996
without
counsel
and
again
in
1998
with
counsel.
in
2000,
as
a
third-time
offender,
his
punishment
could
be
enhanced
from
an
aggravated
misdemeanor
to
a
felony.
to
avoid
that
enhancement,
tovar
through
counsel
asked
the
court
not
to
account
his
first
conviction
because
it
was
unattended
by
adequate
information
on
his
right
to
counsel.
at
that
1996
first
owi
plea
hearing,
tovar
informed
the
court
as
he
earlier
did
in
an
initial
appearance
that
he
wished
to
plea
guilty
and
to
proceed
without
consel.
inquiring
into
the
voluntariness
of
tovar’s
plea,
the
court
told
tovar
that
if
he
elected
to
go
to
trial,
he
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury,
to
counsel's
assistance,
and
to
other
trial
rights.
the
court
further
informed
tovar
of
the
maximum
and
minimum
penalties
for
a
first
owi
conviction.
next,
the
court
explained
that
before
accepting
tovar’s
plea,
the
courts
had
to
assure
that
tovar
was
in
fact
guilty
of
the
two
elements
of
the
charge:
first,
operating
motor
vehicle
in
iowa,
second,
doing
do
while
intoxicated.
tovar
confirmed
that
he
was
driving
in
iowa
and
that
an
intoxilyzer
test
revealed
a
blood
alcohol
level
that
exceeded
the
legal
limit
twice
over.
the
court
then
accepted
tovar’s
guilty
plea
and
the
next
month
sentenced
him
to
the
minimum
term
of
two
days
in
jail
and
a
fine.
the
iowa
supreme
court
reviewing
tovar’s
third
owi
conviction
held
that
because
he
was
not
given
the
two
specific
warnings
just
mentioned
his
first
conviction
could
not
be
used
to
increase
his
third
sentence.
we
reverse
that
determination.
a
waiver
of
counsel
must
be
voluntary
and
intelligent
but
we
have
not
prescribed
any
formula
or
script
to
be
read
to
a
defendant
who
states
that
he
elects
to
plea
guilty
without
counsel.
the
information
the
defendant
must
have
to
make
an
intelligent
election
between
counsel
and
self-representation,
our
decisions
indicate,
will
depend
on
a
range
of
case
specific
factors
including
the
defendant’s
educational
sophistication,
the
complex
or
easily
grasp
nature
of
the
charge
and
the
stage
of
the
proceeding.
in
prescribing
scripted
admonitions
and
holding
them
necessary
in
every
guilty
plea
instance,
the
iowa
supreme
court
overlooked
this
court’s
guiding
decisions
which
described
a
pragmatic
approach.
less
formal
warnings
generally
suffice
pretrial,
we
have
observed,
because
at
that
stage,
the
dangers
and
disadvantages
of
self-representation
are
less
substantial
when
they
are
at
trial
where
a
defendant
must
cope
with
rules
of
procedure
and
evidence,
the
subtleties
of
jury
selection,
witness
examination
and
cross-examination,
objections
to
prosecutor's
questions,
and
much
more.
tovar,
who
bears
the
burden
of
proof
that
his
guilty
plea
was
inadequately
informed,
has
never
stated
just
what
additional
information
counsel
could
have
provided
given
the
simplicity
of
the
owi
charge
he
faced,
nor
has
tovar
ever
asserted
that
he
was
in
fact
unaware
of
his
rights
to
counseled
at
the
plea
stage
or
that
he
did
not
understand
the
nature
of
the
charge
or
the
range
of
possible
punishment.
the
specific
admonitions
the
iowa
supreme
court
mandated
moreover
might
cause
a
defendant
to
wonder
whether
the
court
thinks
he
has
a
good
defense,
when
in
reality
he
does
not.
we
note
finally
that
stage
of
free
to
adopt
any
guidelines
to
the
acceptance
of
an
uncounceled
plea
they
deemed
useful.
we
hold
only
that
the
two
specific
admonitions
the
iowa
supreme
court
ordered
are
not
commanded
by
the
federal
constitution.
the
court’s
opinion
is
unanimous.
