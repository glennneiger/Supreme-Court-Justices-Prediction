mr.
thomas
j.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
modern
guilty
plea
colloquy,
by
focusing
on
and
clearly
articulating
the
consequences
of
pleading
guilty,
paralleling
the
patterson
case,
clearly
constitutes
the...
the
intelligent
and
knowing
waiver
of
counsel
in
this
particular
context.
in
the
modern
guilty
plea
context,
among
other
things,
the
defendant
is
told
the
elements
of
the
crime,
the
range
of
the
sentence,
the
factual
bases
developed
between
the
judge
and
the
defendant
to
assure
that
his
guilt,
and
in
addition,
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
you
know,
we--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--separating
the...
the
two
issues,
first,
the
question
of
whether
he
was
explicitly
told
in
this
proceeding
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
at
this
proceeding.
he
was
not
told
in
that
many
words.
but,
you
know,
there's...
there's
a
presumption
of
regularity
here
based
on
the
johnson
case.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
what...
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is...
is
this,
that
in...
in
the
total
context,
he
clearly
knew
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
and,
indeed,
that
really
is
the...
the
words
that
submit
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--you
know,
i...
i
don't...
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
it
should
be,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
your...
your
honor,
i...
i
don't
think
he
actually
signed
a
form.
what...
what
did
happen
is
that
he
was
informed
at
the...
informed
at
the
arrest
through
the
miranda
warnings
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
and
then
he
went
for
a
initial
appearance,
and
this
is...
this
is
the
part
that...
that
i
think
we
focus
on.
at
the
initial
appearance,
the
judge
marked
the
form
saying
application
for
court-appointed
counsel,
and
then
wrote
waived.
in
other
words,
he
had
given
the
opportunity
at
this
initial
appearance
for
counsel.
going
forward,
there...
there
was
no
reason
to...
to
interrupt
the
initial
appearance
and
having
to
have
counsel
at...
at
initial
appearance.
it
was
going
forward.
and
then
the
words
that
justice
breyer
referred
to,
when
he
went
to...
went
to
the
plea
hearing,
the
judge
said,
you
know,
i
see
that
you've...
you've
waived
counsel,
and
then
he
says
i
assume
that
you
want
to
proceed
to
represent
yourself.
so
we
think
that...
that
that
really
satisfies
the
requirement--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--the
initial
hearing...
the
checklist
is
in...
is
in
the
documents
that...
that
were
given...
given
to
this
court.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes,
your
honor,
that--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
that's--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--that...
that's
exactly
right.
that's
what
the
iowa
supreme
court
held.
you
know,
it
wasn't...
it
wasn't
raised
at
the
district
court
level.
it
wasn't
raised
in
the
opposition
to
the
cert
petition.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
i
think...
i
think
the...
the
point
is
this,
that
in
the
plea
setting
it
is
very
analogous
to
the
patterson
setting
and
not
analogous
to
the
faretta
setting
at...
at
going
to
trial
without
counsel.
and...
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
your
honor,
that
going
through
the
plea
and
hearing
the
elements
and
going
through
the
factual
basis
and
knowing
the
punishments,
that's
something
a
person
can
comprehend
and
can
make
a
decision
on,
just
like
the
court
held
in
patterson
that
the
decision
to
answer
a
question
under
interrogation
or
not
under
interrogation
is
something
someone
could
do.
but
in...
in
the
trial
setting,
it
is
just
so
difficult
for
a
person
to
represent
himself
in
terms
of
the
rule
of
evidence,
in
terms
of
strategy,
witnesses,
choosing
the
jury.
those
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
it
is
just
so
difficult.
what
we
do
is
two
things.
we
inform
the
defendant
of
all
those
difficulties
and
by
informing
him
as...
with
a...
with
an
authority
figure
like
a
judge,
we're...
we're
pushing
him
towards
counsel.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
well,
your
honor,
i
think...
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
useful...
useful
functions,
the
ones
you
described,
also
collateral
consequences.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
but...
but
generally
in
exercising
these
rights
and
describing
these
rights,
you
give
the
general...
the
general
right,
not...
not
the
specific
services.
the...
the
ruiz
case
indicates
that.
and
in
the
patterson
setting,
the...
you
know,
the
things
that
a
lawyer
could
do
about
strategy
on
the
questions
or
make
sure
that
you
weren't
tripped
up
on
the
questions,
that
was
not
required
by
patterson.
it's
the...
it's
the
main
consequences.
it's
the
direct
consequences
that
patterson
requires
and
that
this
requires.
and,
your
honor,
if
we
go
into
all
the
useful
things
that
an
attorney
can
do...
and...
and
certainly
there
are
many...
then
it's...
it's
almost
an
endless
list.
it's
a
fairly
long
list.
and
then
we're
cluttering
up
the...
the
colloquy.
it's
already
a...
a
rather
long
colloquy.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
it
would...
it
would
have...
i
guess
it
would
have
to
come
after
that.
i
mean,
i
think...
i
think
the
factual
basis
is
really
the
key
here.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
the...
because
that's...
that's
the...
that's
our...
that's
our
real
assurance
that
guilty--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--you
know,
i...
i
don't
think
there
is
a
great
interest,
your
honor,
and
i
don't...
i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
the...
the
system
is
served
here
particularly
what...
what
the
iowa
supreme
court
required
that,
you
know,
a...
and
a
lawyer
can
give
you
an
independent
assessment
of...
of
whether
it's
wise
to
plead
guilty.
obviously,
that's
something
that...
that
we
know
about
lawyers.
and
also
really
subsumed
in
that,
to
some
extent,
is
the...
the
question
of
defenses,
but
it's
not
a...
it's
not
a
particularly
helpful
litany
that
they've
developed.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
well,
i...
i
think
that...
that
he
has
to
know
that
he
has...
has
the
right...
right
to
counsel.
but--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--the...
he
knows
that
counsel
is...
would
be
helpful.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
he
doesn't
have
to
be
told.
an
individual
knows
that...
that...
it
certainly
follows
much
like
in
patterson...
knows
that
the
counsel
would
advise
him
whether
to
ask...
answer
the
questions
or
not.
but
that's
something
someone--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--he
should...
he
should
know
at
the
plea
hearing
that
he
had
a
right
to
counsel.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
the...
the
judge
said,
you
know,
i...
i
see
you...
you
made
application,
which
would
have
been
for
this
hearing,
for...
you...
you
did
not
make
application--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--well,
i
think
that
question
was
really
did
you
change
your
mind.
i
mean--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--you
made...
you
made
a
decision
at
the
initial
hearing
going
forward
towards
this
hearing
that
you
wouldn't
have
counsel.
have
you
changed
your
mind?
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
that...
that
certainly
would--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes.
you
know,
i...
i
think
it
is.
you
know,
this...
every...
every
presumption
is...
is
in
our
favor
in
this
kind
of
collateral
setting.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
well,
i...
i
think,
your
honor,
in...
in
the
context
of
the
discussion
at
the
initial
appearance
and
then
drawing
that
towards
the...
forward
into
the...
the
plea...
plea
hearing,
that...
and...
and
certainly
indulging
the...
the
presumptions
here,
that...
that
that...
that
he
did
know.
and
indeed,
to
this
date
he's
not
asserted
that
he
didn't
know.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
it...
it
was,
your
honor.
it
would
be
associate
district
court.
it
would
be
a
situation
where
there...
there
would
be
a...
would
be
a
judge
and...
who,
you
know,
went
through
a...
you
know,
a
long
colloquy
with
the...
with...
went
through
a
colloquy
concerning
representation.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes,
your
honor.
it...
it
parallels
rule
11.
it's...
our
rule
8
is...
is
very
similar
to...
to
rule
11.
and
at
the...
at
the
plea
hearing,
of
course,
he
was
asked
three
times
whether
he
wanted
to
plea
or
whether
he
wanted
to...
to
go
forward
and...
and
contest
the
case
and
that's...
in
that
setting.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
what...
what
we're
saying,
your
honor,
is
that...
that
that
was
covered
by
the...
the
words
that
justice
breyer
mentioned
at...
at
the
outset,
that
you
know,
i...
i
see
you
waived
application
for
counsel
at...
at
the
prior...
it
would
have
been
at
the
prior
proceedings,
which
would
have
been
for
this
proceeding,
and
do
you...
you
know,
do
you
continue
to
want
to
represent
yourself.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
yes,
yes,
your
honor.
the...
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
--that...
that
was
at...
at
that
proceeding,
and...
and
we
argue
that
that...
those
are
the...
those
are
the
key
words
that
really...
really
wrap
up
this
issue,
that
he
was
told
before
he
had
a
right
to
counsel
at
this
hearing.
there's
a
referral
back.
it
was
reaffirmed
that
he
wanted
to
represent
himself
at...
at
the
hearing.
as
i
say,
that...
that...
you
know,
it
was
not
raised
by
the...
by
the
defendant
at
the
trial
court
level
or
in
the...
or
in
the
resistance
to
the
cert
petition.
and
to
this
day,
they...
they've
not
asserted
that
he
didn't
know
that
he
had
the
right
to
counsel
at
the...
at
the
plea...
at
the
plea
hearing.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
the
state
has...
has
not
on
this...
on
this
particular
issue.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
not...
not
that
i
know
of,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
i...
i
was
assuming
on...
on
the
matter
that
was
before
the
court
as...
as
a
matter
of
the
cert
petition,
that...
that
i
do
not
know
of
other
jurisdictions
that
decided
solely
on...
on
state
grounds.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time.
mr.
thomas
j.
miller
i
would
just
pick
up
on...
on
justice
ginsburg's
question
or
comment
there
that
in
terms
of
usefulness
of
counsel,
there's
a...
you
know,
we've
explored
a
lot
of
difficulties
and
cross
currents
here
today.
what
should
happen
is
the
states,
as
a
matter
of...
of
the
legislature
or
as
a
matter
of
the...
the
court,
making
rules
that...
that
deal
with
these
issues,
rather
than
having
a
constitutional
mandate
for
the
whole
country.
with
that,
i
would
close
except
if
there
are
other
questions
from
the
court.
