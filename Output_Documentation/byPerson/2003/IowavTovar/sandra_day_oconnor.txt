well,
if
someone
is
going
to
plead
guilty,
i
guess
the
question
may
boil
down
to
whether
he
has
a
right
to
be
told
the
he
could
be
represented
by
an
attorney
in
making
the
decision
to
plead
and
that
it
might
be
useful
to
him
to
have
an
attorney's
advice
in
making
that
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
guilty
plea.
it
wasn't
a
going
to
trial
and
he
was
told
certainly
of
all
the
things
that
could
be
involved
in
a
trial
and
how
an
attorney
would
be
helpful
but
was
not
told,
i
guess,
expressly
that
if
you
plead
guilty,
you
can
be
represented
by
counsel
and
the
attorney
might
give
you
useful
advice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
the
iowa
court
made
rather
a
long
laundry
list
of
requirements.
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
along
with
all
of
those
things,
but
i
am
interested
to
know
whether
you
think
there
is
a
baseline
requirement
that
the
court
advise
the
defendant
in
making
a
plea
that
he
has
a
right
to
counsel
and
the
attorney
could
be
helpful
in
making
that
decision.

justice

mr.
stewart,
do
you
know
what
the
general
practice
is
in
federal
courts?
are
there
instructions
given
to
prosecutors
to
make
sure,
for
example,
that
the
defendant
at
a
guilty
plea
is
told
that
maybe
the...
that
he
has
a
right
to
a
lawyer
and
he
might
be
helpful?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
the
practice
in...
in
other
states
generally?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is...
is
there
any
allegation
in
this
case
that
the
defendant
didn't
know
he
had
a
right
to
appointed
counsel
for
the
plea?
that
allegation
has
not
been
made
before,
has
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
making
it
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
any
other
jurisdiction
that
has
required
such
a...
a
litany
of
warnings
before
a
plea
could
be
accepted?
