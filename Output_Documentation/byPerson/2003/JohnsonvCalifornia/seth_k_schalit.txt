mr.
seth
k.
schalit
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
more
likely
than
not
standard
identified
by
the
california
supreme
court
gives
content
to
the
prima
facie
case
requirement
and
preserves
the
proper
balance
between
the
anti-discrimination
principles
enshrined
in
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
state's
and
parties'
interest
in
using
peremptory
challenges
to
select
a
qualified
and
unbiased
jury.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
i'll
attempt
to
do
so,
your
honor.
the
situation
i
think
is
akin
to
that
under
which
multiple
claims
are
raised
and
a
court
of
appeal
disposes
of
it
based
on
one
ground
and
does
not
discuss
anything
else.
and
that
court
is
therefore...
thereafter
reversed
on
appeal.
i
think
that
is
a
final
judgment.
the...
the
defendant
in
this
case
has
been
deprived
of
his
reversal
and
that
is
what--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--i
think
so,
your
honor,
in
that
the...
the
legal
issue
is...
is
still
present
as
to
the--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--regrettably,
your
honor,
unfortunately
i
haven't
had
time--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
that's
as
best
as
i
can
do.
my
apologies.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
my
apologies,
your
honor.
beyond
what
i've
already
articulated
in
terms
of
that...
deprivation
of
that
reversal
based
on
that
issue
is
the
extent
of
my
knowledge,
this
issue
not
having
been
briefed.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
no,
your
honor.
it
is
not
the
latter
test.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
no.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
because
the
judge
is
operating
as
the
fact
finder
in
this
setting,
and
given
the
nature
of
the
prima
facie
case
requirement,
which
is
one
that
when
the
prima
facie
case
is
met,
entitles
the
objecting
party
to
prevail--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--that
depends
on
the
function
of
the
prima
facie
case
in
term...
in...
in
the
context
in
which
it's
being
used.
there
are
two--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
if
it
is
a
question
of
has
the--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--if
that's
the
question,
then
it
is
an
inference--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
in
the
face
of
his
opponent's
silence,
your
honor--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
essentially,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
in
the...
in
the
batson
context.
it
is
not
a
presumption
in
the
mcdonnell
sense
of
having
proved
certain
predicate
elements.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
correct,
your
honor.
the
judge
must
evaluate
the
response
and
the...
and
the
rest
of
the
evidence
in
determining
whether
the
objector
has
met
his
ultimate
burden
of
persuasion.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
in
a
stage
three,
your
honor,
of
a
batson
proceeding?
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
correct,
your
honor.
having
now
heard
the
reasons,
the
trial
court
will
evaluate
the
credibility
of
the
prosecutor.
as
the
plurality
recognized
in
hernandez,
frequently
the
credibility
of
the
striking
party
will
be
dispositive.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
correct,
your
honor.
that
is--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
that
ignores
the
disposition
in
batson
itself
in
which
the
court
explained
that
on
remand
it
was
up
to
the
trial
court
to
determine
whether
there
was
a
prima
facie
case,
and
if
the
prosecutor
did
not
come
forward
with
his
race-neutral
reasons,
the
judgment
had
to
be
reversed.
it
is
that--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--not
entirely,
your
honor,
in
that
it
is
not
the
court's
obligation
nor
do
california
courts
seek
out
to
save
the
striking
party.
what
they
do
do
is
attempt
to
determine
whether
the
objecting
party
has
met
its
burden
of
persuasion
at
that
first
step,
and
in
considering
everything
before
it,
it
will
make
that
determination.
now,
there
may
be--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
justice
o'connor,
certainly
numerosity
is
an
important
point
or
an
important
consideration.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
your...
your
honor,
your
example
actually
needs
additional
facts.
if,
for
example,
one
of
those
african
american
prospective
jurors
said,
i
hate
cops
and
the
second
was
wearing,
you
know,
crypts
colors
in
a
case
involving
the
blood,
and
the
third
was
half
asleep
and
the
fourth
had
some
other
obvious
explanation,
then
no.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
your
honor,
because
of
the...
it
is
the
trial
judge's
obligation
under
batson
to
evaluate
all
the
facts
and
circumstances.
batson
itself
recognized
that
the
prosecutor's
questioning
during
voir
dire
may
support
or
refute--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--i
think
it's
up
to
the
trial...
trial
judge
to
determine
whether
the
objector
has
met
his
burden
of
persuasion
as
more
likely
than
not.
if
i
can
see
a
legitimate
reason--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--and
i
think
it's
important,
your
honor,
to
distinguish
the
rule
as
understood
on
appeal
in
california
from
the
rule
in
application
in
the
trial
courts.
it
is
not
can
we
hypothesize
a
potential
reason
in...
from
the
trial
judge's
perspective
that
there's
a
challenge
here.
it
is
up
to
the
trial
judge
to
determine
from
all
of
the
evidence
whether
it
is
more
likely
than
not.
and
maybe
i
have
a
reason
but--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--not...
not
particularly,
your
honor.
if
the
prosecutor
has--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
prosecutor
three
african
american
prospective
jurors,
all
of
whom
are
defense
attorneys
and
they're
struck
by
the
prosecutor,
there's
nothing
odd
about
not
asking
about
that.
they're
all
defense
attorneys.
if,
however,
maybe,
you
know,
there
was
a
little
something
that
one
of
the
jurors
did
and
i
can
sort
of
see
the
reason
for
that,
but
they
struck
12
of
them
and
i
sort
of
see
a
reason,
that's
not
enough
most
likely
in
the
more
likely
than
not
context.
and
the
prosecutor
will
be
required
to
state
reasons.
now,
that
is
different
than
on
appeal
where,
of
course,
the
judgment
of
the
trial
court
is
presumed
correct
and
the
trial
court
is
the
entity
that
has
seen
everything.
and
if
on
the
face
of
the
record,
there's
something
that
appears
to
be
the
reason,
well,
then
that
must
be
used
on
appeal,
just
as
in
the
other
appeal
to
support
the
judgment
below.
but
it
is
the
trial
court's
obligation
to
evaluate
everything
before
it,
and
to
determine--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that
is
the
purpose
of
the...
of
the
prima
facie
case
requirement.
it
is
to
allocate
the
introduction
of
the
burden
of
proof
and
it
is
to
protect
the
constitutionality
of
the
state
statute
and
the
nature
of
the
challenges
as
being
peremptory.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
and
that--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--just
as
the
employer
is
told
that
essentially
in
a
title
vii
case
when
the
evidence
is
introduced
on
those
four
mcdonnell
douglas
factors
and
the
evidence
is
persuasive.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
well,
then
there's--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--correct,
your
honor.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
in
the...
in
the
batson
setting,
in
the
title
vii
cases,
in
any
case
in
which
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
found,
going
back
to
kelly
v.
peters
with
justice
story,
there
is
such
evidence
that
unless
rebutted,
the
party
with
the
burden
of
persuasion
will
prevail.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
certainly
it
does
operate
when
there
is
a
presumption
established
by
the
court,
as
this
court
did
in
mcdonnell
douglas.
it
also
operates
when
there
is
a...
what
wigmore
referred
to
as
a
strong
mass
of
evidence.
that
concept
cannot
be
alighted
from
the
definition
of
a
prima
facie
case
in
that--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--we
are...
there
are...
there
are
other
cases
that
announced
the
same
standard.
maryland
announced
it.
connecticut
announced
it.
the
court
below
recognized
that.
there
are
a
handful
of
cases
on
the
other
side
that
recognize
inference.
the
ninth
circuit
does.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
my
belief
is
that
actually
the
supreme
court
of
connecticut
under
its
supervisory
authority
established
a
sort
of--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--not...
yes.
they
don't
apply
it,
but
they
don't
apply
it
based
on
their
supervisory
authority.
as
an
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
batson,
it's
still
valid.
and
because
it's
actually
california,
maryland,
and
connecticut
that
have
considered
the
meaning
of
batson
and
the
title
vii
cases.
the
other
cases...
the
ninth
circuit
just
looked
at
the
word
and
said
inference.
they
isolated
that
word
from
the
rest
of
the
batson
opinion.
that's
not
the
appropriate
way
to
read
an
opinion.
it
must
be
considered
in
context.
batson
expressly
told
the
courts
to
look
to
the
title
vii
cases
for
an
explanation
of
the
operation
of
the
prima
facie
case
rules.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
correct,
your
honor.
and
that
is
one
example
of
a
prima
facie
case
with
a
shifting
burden
of
production
that
entitles
the
party
to
prevail
in
the
face
of
silence.
the
other
example
included
in
that
same
section
of
wigmore
is
the
strong
mass
of
evidence,
and
he
later
explains
that
those
things
are
different
in
operation
and
they
differ...
but
the
same
in
effect.
and
the
effect
is
the
same.
the
operation
is
different
and
the
operation--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--not
presumption
in
the
sense
that
there
are
four
elements
of
mcdonnell
douglas
that
apply
in
a
batson
context.
there
can't
be
those
four
elements.
every
time
there's
a
challenge
in
a
batson
setting,
the
four
elements
of
mcdonnell
douglas,
for
example,
would
have
been
met.
the
juror
would
have
been
a
minority
qualified,
excused,
and
replaced.
so
the...
the
reference
in
batson
to
the
title
vii
is
not
to
a
presumption,
but
to
the
operation
of
the
prima
facie
case
rules,
and
the
operation
of
those
rules
are
such
that
you
provide
sufficient
evidence
to
entitle
you
to
prevail
in
the
face
of
silence.
and
wigmore
ties
that
together
with
being
synonyms
for
the
same
mechanism.
they
are
akin
to
presumptions.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
that...
your
honor,
wigmore
recognized
there
are
these
two
means
in
which
you
can
create
the
prima
facie
case.
one
is
the
presumption.
and
that
is
helpful
in
a
case
in
which
there's
a
run
of
the
mill
type
facts
and
in
the
run
of
the
cases,
that
fact
that
is
presumed,
more
likely
than
not,
follows
from
the
predicate
facts.
that
cannot
be
applied
in
batson.
what
does
apply
in
batson,
however,
is
the
other
aspect
of
the
prima
facie
case
mechanism
recognized
by
wigmore
which
is
the
strong
mass
of
evidence
concept.
that
has
to
be
what
is
applied
here
in
that
the
nature
of
the
jury
selection--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--precisely,
your
honor,
and
that
is
to
his
advantage.
as...
as
u.s.
v.
armstrong
recognized,
the
res
gestae
takes
place
in
front
of
the
court.
it
takes
place
in
front
of
the
parties
therefore.
everything
that
that
party
needs
is
available
to
the
party.
this
is
not
swain
where
the
objecting
party
would
have
to
engage
in
some
sort
of
historical
discovery
and
analysis.
everything
the
party
needs
is
there,
and
the
striking
party
has--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--correct,
your
honor,
to
which
he
is
not
entitled
until
he
demonstrates
entitlement
to
relief
and
is
able
to
overturn
the
statute
and
make
it
unconstitutional
as
applied.
this
court
has
already
rejected--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--that's...
that's
the
nature
of
privilege
of
peremptory
challenges,
the
nature
of
any
other
privilege
that
protects
information.
this
court
has
already
rejected
this
sort
of
inference
standard
in
its
voir
dire
cases.
it's...
it
requires
that
you
inquire
of
jurors,
if
there's
a
possibility
of...
not
if
there's
a
possibility
of
prejudice
but
if
it's
constitutionally
significant.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
no,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
question
of
the
burden
of
the...
of
the
10
seconds
it
takes
to
state
an
answer.
it
is
a
question
of
the
burden
on
the
peremptory
challenge
system
and
the
effect
on
the
voir
dire
process.
a
low
standard
will
create
an
incentive
to
bring
these
motions
more
frequently.
that
requires
excusing
the
jury
every
time.
that
requires
taking
a
proceeding
and
getting
an
answer.
and
that
may,
in
turn,
require
proceedings
through
rebuttal.
well,
let's
go
through
our
dozen
discharged
jurors
and
piles
of
questionnaires
to
do
a
determination
of
whether
this
is
pretext.
moreover,
it
is
the
nature
of
the
peremptory
challenge
system
that
is
entitled
to
protection.
these
challenges
are
peremptory.
we
don't
want
to
discourage
challenges
based
on
hunches
which
will
be
discouraged
under
a
lower
standard.
this
gives
the
trial
courts
a
clear
guidance.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
yes,
that
was
his
view,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
he
had
that
view
was
because
he
did
not
like
the
batson
rule
which
required
a
flagrant
showing
of
discrimination
in
order
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
prima
facie
case.
he
understood
that
a
prima
facie
case
was
one
that
entitled
the
party
to
relief.
that
was
the--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
numbers
are
that
stark,
given
that
most
cases--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--there's
certainly
a
divergence.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
your
honor,
i
think
that
certainly
the
footnote
in
batson
in
the
final
part
of
the
discussion
recognizes
the...
that
it
is
left
to
the
states
to
determine
procedures
to
govern
batson.
now,
on
the
other
hand--
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
--quite
possibly,
your
honor,
in
that
we
believe
more
likely
than
not
is...
is
the
result
from
batson
given
the
title
vii
description.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
that...
that
footnote
and
leaving
to
the
states.
and
it
is
not
unheard
of,
to
return
to
justice
kennedy's
earlier
question,
to
have
some
variance.
and
i
think
one
good
example
of
that
is
incompetence
and
medina
v.
california,
which
recognized
that
california
could
use
the
more
likely
than
not
standard
and
place
that
burden
on
the
party
claiming
he
was
incompetent.
other
states
can
have
a
different
burden.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
your
honor,
i'm
not
aware
of
anyone
having
conducted
a
time
in
motion
study
of...
of
voir
dire
in
the
various
states
to
find
out
how
they're
proceeding.
certainly
the
system
does
not
have
to
collapse
in
order
to
conclude
that
the
more
likely
than
not
standard,
with
its
advantages
and
its
compliance
with
title
vii,
with
the
holding
in
batson,
with
the
nature
of
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional
as
applied,
is
constitutionally
prohibited.
it
is
a
somewhat
surprising
notion
to
suggest
that
using
the
lowest
of
the
three
basic
burdens
of
persuasion
is
constitutionally
prohibited.
mr.
seth
k.
schalit
i
think
it's
unknowable,
your
honor,
that
the...
the
extent
to
which
the
system
is
burdened
is
not
something
that
can
be
readily
determined.
you
can
infer
that
there
is
a
burden
imposed
on
it,
one
that
california
can
legitimately
seek
to
