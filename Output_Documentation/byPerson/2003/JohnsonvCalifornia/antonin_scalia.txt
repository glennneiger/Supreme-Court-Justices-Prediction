justice
scalia
just
so
we
can
get
it
behind
us,
do
you
have
any
observation
on
the
apparent
jurisdictional
problem
we
have?
can
you
give
us
a
hand?
justice
scalia
even
when
it's
been
remanded,
when
the
judgment
is,
you
know,
i
decided
on
this
ground
and
then
i
remand
it
for
further
proceedings
in
the
case?
justice
scalia
that's
not
the
test.
the
test
is
whether
the
case
is
final.
justice
scalia
yes,
we
sort
of
sprung
it
on
you.
justice
scalia
okay.
i
just
thought
you
might
have
an
answer.
