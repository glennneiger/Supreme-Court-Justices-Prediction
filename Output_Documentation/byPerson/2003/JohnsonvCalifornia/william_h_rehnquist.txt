rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
bedrick.
mr.
schalit,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bedrick.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
in
no.
03-6539
johnson
against
california.
we
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
to
review
a
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
california
interpreting
batson
against
kentucky,
a
challenge
as
to
jurors.
the
case
was
briefed
and
argued
but
we
now
conclude
that
we
are
without
jurisdiction
in
the
matter
because
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
was
not
final.
we
conclude
this
opinion
in
these
words,
"it
behooves
counsel
for
both
petitioner
and
respondent
to
assure
themselves
that
the
decision
for
which
review
was
sought
is
indeed
a
final
judgment
under
section
1257.
such
attention
is
mandated
by
our
rules
and
will
avoid
the
expenditure
of
resources
of
both
counsel
and
of
this
court
on
an
abortive
proceeding
such
as
the
present
one."
we
dismiss
the
case
for
want
of
jurisdiction.
the
per
curiam
opinion
is
unanimous.
