mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
address
three
points.
first,
the
correct
prima
facie
standard
under
batson
is
whether
there
is
sufficient
evidence
to
permit
a
reasonable
judge
to
infer
discrimination.
the
california
threshold
is
too
high
and
incorrectly
conflates
step
one
and
step
three
of
batson
analysis.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
would
say
the
former
rather
than
the
latter,
your
honor.
i'm
suggesting
sufficient
evidence
to
permit
a
reasonable
trial
judge
to
infer
that
there
was
racial
discrimination
in
jury
selection.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
absolutely
not.
california
uses
a
standard
of
preponderance
of
the
evidence
and
we
believe
that
is
substantially
higher
than
that
which
the...
the
standard
which
this
court
suggested
in
batson
and
in
purkett
v.
elem
and
in
hernandez
v.
new
york.
this
standard
is
substantially
higher
than
used
by
anywhere
else
in
the
country.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
that's
a
good
question.
in
discussion
with
associates,
we
thrashed
that
around.
probable
cause
is
much
too
high.
reasonable
suspicion,
which
is
lower
than
probable
cause,
starts
to
get
near
it,
but
i
know
the
court
had
a
reasonable
suspicion
case
last
week
and
i
don't
know
all
the
intricacies
of
it.
my
sense
is
somewhat--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--no.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
when
the
test
goes
to
the
jury,
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
proving
his
case
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
think
that
is
close
to
the
test
that
i'm
asking
for,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
absolutely,
your
honor.
all
we're
asking
is
that
prosecutor
be...
or
the...
or
the
challenger,
whoever
that
may
be,
be
asked
the
reason.
so
what
we
are
ask...
our
standard
is
somewhat
closer
to
a
discovery
standard.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
respectfully
disagree.
the
series--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--very
much
so
because
the...
the
series
of
cases
from
this
court,
the
batson-hernandez-elem
trilogy,
and...
and
also
the...
some
of
the
title
vii
cases
provide
that
even
though
the
burden
of
producing
evidence
shifts,
the
burden
of
persuasion
never
shifts.
so--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
win
either
under
batson
or
under
title
vii.
this
court
decided
a
couple
of
cases,
including
reeves
and
st.
mary's
honor
center
in
which
the
finding
was
a
prima
facie
case
was
made,
the
employer
gave
a
reason,
the
trial
judge
said
i
disbelieve
that
reason--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--i
don't--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--in
the
batson
context,
your
honor,
we
have
never
come
across
a
case...
there
may
be
one.
we
have
never
come
across
one
where
the
prosecutor
stood
silent.
the
prosecutor
always
has
a
reason.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes,
but
even
so,
even...
even
in
this
theoretical
and
i
think
inconceivable
hypothetical
situation,
if
the
challenger
stood
silent,
the
trial
judge
still
has
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
objector
has
proven
discrimination
at
that
point,
at
stage
three,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
no.
the
prosecutor--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--the
prosecutor
knows
that
he
will
look
bad
if
he
does
not
come
up
with
a
reason.
a
prosecutor
knows
that
the
trial
judge
could
infer
that
something
is
up
or
something
has
been
done
wrong
if
he
doesn't
come
up
with
a
reason.
but
our
prosecutors
are
bright
and
energetic
and
talkative
and
garrulous
people.
they
always
have
a
reason
for
everything.
so
in
this
case...
and
even
there
are
many
cases.
in
the
many
cases
where
the
question
of
prima
facie
case
is
being
discussed
and
it
looks
like
it's
a
close
case,
in
many
of
those,
a
careful
prosecutor
will
say,
your
honor,
let's
not
hang
this
case
up
at
the
prima
facie
level.
i
would...
let's...
let
me
not
leave
a
record
that
is
not
clear.
i
would
like
to
tell
you
what
my
reason
is
and
here--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--with
one
juror
challenged,
six
remain,
from
the
defense
perspective,
i
would
say
i
have
a
very
lousy...
lousy
chance
of
making
a
prima
facie
case,
and
i
would
not
make
that
argument.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
then
i
guess
we
would
hope
to
find
some
evidence
of
the
prosecutor's
reason.
perhaps
he
had--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--at
that
point
i
would
suggest
that
the
wise
trial
judge
would
find
a
prima
facie
case,
avoid
any
possible
discrimination
and
ask
jury
selection
to
begin
anew.
at
that
point,
the
cost
to
the
system
is
1
day
of
poor
jurors
parading
through.
that's
a
much
lower
cost
than
the
risk
of
this
case
going
to
the
jury
and
being
tried
by
a
jury
that
has
been
chosen
with
racial
discrimination.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i...
i
need
some
more
facts.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--if--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--that
is
why
we
are
arguing
here
for
this...
for
the
threshold
that
we
are
arguing
for,
which
is
a
relatively...
relatively
low
threshold
at
which
the
trial
judge
examines
all
the
circumstances
and,
when
in
doubt,
rules
that
there
should
be
a
prima
facie
case,
and
then
we
get
an
answer,
and
then
the
trial
judge
makes
a
decision
based
on
an
answer,
and
then
we
get
a
record.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
because
in
response
to
the
last
question,
i
was
trying
to
show
that
one
of
the
things
that
are
missing
when
a...
when
the
questions
are
not
asked
of
the
challenger
is
a
record.
we
do
not
know
what
the
answer
would
be,
and
that
puts
the
appellate
court
in
a
much
more
difficult
situation.
so
that
is
what
i
was
saying.
when
we're...
when
in
doubt,
one
of
the
benefits
that
we
obtain
from
an
answer
is
a
record
so
that
it
can
be
reviewed.
furthermore,
my
guess
is
most
of
the
prosecutor's
answers
will,
in
fact,
show
race-neutral
reasons.
then
we
have
no
problem.
everyone
knows
what
the
situation
is.
the
answer
has
been
revealed.
it
does
not
become
an
appellate
issue
and
everyone
then
has
confidence
that
the
jury
has
been
fairly
chosen.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
would
say
it
depends
on
the
discretion
of
the
objecting
party.
if
there
was
only
one
minority
juror
and
defense
counsel
thought
that
that
was
a
good
juror
and
therefore
smelled
possible
discrimination,
then
defense
counsel
might
make
the
challenge
at
the
time
of
the
first
juror.
if--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--the
first
motion
here
was
made
after
the
second
african
american
juror
and
the
second--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--and
the
second
motion
was
made
after
the
third
african
american
juror.
so
defense
counsel
did
not...
did
not
make
his
motion
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity.
he
may
have
been
giving
his
opponent
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
but
after
the
opponent
challenged
two
out
of
two,
he
no
longer
thought
there
should
be
a
benefit
of
the
doubt.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
in...
in
this--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--i've
seen
it
done
all
different
ways.
i've
seen
it
done
out
in
the
back
hall.
i've
seen
it
done
at
the
bench.
i've
seen
it
done
with
the
room
cleared,
and
i've
seen
it
done
in
front
of
the
whole
jury.
they
do
it
all
different
ways.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
here
both
motions
were
discussed
outside
of
the
presence
of
the
jury,
and
that
was,
of
course--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--the
trial
judge
in
this
case
on
the
first
motion,
decided
that
there
was
no
prima
facie
case
because
the
trial
judge
speculated
as
to
possible
reasons
on
the
record
that
might
theoretically
and
arguably
have
provided
a
race-neutral
reason.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the
trial
judge
asked
the
prosecutor,
mr.
prosecutor,
i'm
about
to...
i'm
in
the...
i'm
about
to
rule
that
there's
no
prima
facie
case.
do
you
have
anything
you
want
to
add?
do
you
have
any
reasons
you
want
to
state?
and
the
prosecutor
said,
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
want
to--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--that
was
clearly
too
late
in
the
process,
but
there
are
many
other
cases
i
mentioned
earlier
where
when
a
prima
facie
case
seems
relatively
close,
the
intelligent
prosecutor
will
give
a
reason
and
make
his
record
and
protect
his
record.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
there
are
other
issues--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
no.
this...
this
case
has
been
tried
three
times.
in
the...
the
first
case
got
three-quarters
of
the
way
through.
there
was
a
brady
problem.
a
mistrial
was
granted.
there
was
a
second
trial.
there
was
a
conviction
after
the
second
trial.
in
that
second
trial,
there
were
instructional
errors
regarding
concurrent
causes.
there
was
a
reversal
on
that.
this
now
is
the
appeal
from
the
third
trial.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
there
are
other
issues
that
the
court
of
appeal
did
not
reach.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
we
certainly
have
a...
we
certainly
have
a
final
judgment
from
a
trial
which
is
a
conviction
of
the
defendant.
we
have
a...
we
have
a
decision
from
the
intermediate
court
of
appeal
that
says
reversed.
we
have
a
decision
from
the
state
supreme
court
that
says
reversed
again.
so
that
we
have
lost
our...
we
have
lost
our
batson
argument.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the...
yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
that
is
theoretically
possible,
but
i
think--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
very
much
hope
that
the
court
would
reach
the
issues
here.
we've
put
in
a
lot
of
time
on
that.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
believe
that--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--i
understand.
[laughter]
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
we
have
a...
california
has...
differs
from
every
other
court
in
the
nation
on
several
of
these
jury
selection
points.
california
has
a
standard
that
is
much
higher
than
virtually
everyone
else
in
the
nation.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
this
issue
has
not
been
raised
by
either
side
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
so
that
it
is
my
understanding
that
we
have
a
final...
we
have
a
final
judgment
from
the
trial
court
of
convicting
the
defendant.
we
have
what
is
a
final
judgment
from
the
intermediate
court
of
appeal,
which
was
a
reversal.
that
court
did
not
need
to
reach
the
other
issues.
it
felt
it
did
not
need
to
bother
to
reach
them.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
if
it
needs
to
reach
those,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
it
very
much
is,
your
honor.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
absolutely
not.
so
that
what
i
was
hoping
to
argue
to
the
court
was
we
have
a
very
distinct
and
sharp
conflict
between
the
state
of
california
and
the
ninth
circuit
and,
indeed,
between
the
state
of
california
and
the
rest
of
the
country
on
several
of
these
issues.
what
is
the--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--because
california
did
not
present
any
federalism
issues
at
the
state
supreme
court
nor
does
my
opponent.
california
said
we
are
deciding
the
federal
constitutional
issues.
we
are
deciding
this
case
under
batson.
we
believe
that
our
standard
complies
with
batson.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
there
are...
there...
there
are
some...
i'm
not
sure
what
aspects
were
left
to
the
states,
but
california's
supreme
court
did
not...
the
state
makes
this
argument,
but
the
california
supreme
court
did
not.
the
california
supreme
court
did
not
say
anything
addressing
any
independent
state
ground.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the
best
standard
we
could
come
up
with,
your
honor,
was
something
that
was
similar
to
the
standard
on
a
federal
civil
procedure
12(b)(6)
motion.
on
a
motion
to
dismiss,
could
a
reasonable
trial...
could
a
reasonable
trier
of
fact
find
for
the
plaintiff?
that
was...
that
is
the
closest
analog
we
have.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
that...
that's
what
12(b)(6)
would
be,
your
honor.
so
the
question
is
can
the
plaintiff
get
out...
can
the
plaintiff
get
out
of
the
batter's
box.
so
that
that
is...
that
is
the
type
of
language
that...
that
we
are
seeing
in
the
federal
courts
interpreting
the
raise
in
inference.
that's
also
what
we
are...
in
title
vii
contexts
we're
actually
seeing
a
lower
threshold.
in
title
vii,
to
establish
a
prima
facie
case,
the
plaintiff
needs
to
show
that
he
was
part
of...
of
a
protected
group,
that
he
was
qualified
for
a
job,
that
he
applied,
that
he
was
rejected,
and
the
employer
is
still
looking.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i...
i
guess
i'm
persuaded
that
we
are
somewhat
higher
than
rule
12(b)(6).
i
think
we're
also
somewhat
lower
than
reasonable
suspicion.
but
i
think
this
standard
comes
up
in
many
other
kinds
of
motions
where
ordinary
civil
procedure
motions
where
a
plaintiff
wants
to
proceed
and
for...
a
motion
for
challenged
discovery,
for
example.
the
plaintiff
wants
to
proceed
and
the
defendant
says
we
don't
want
our
witness
brought
in
here.
he's
an
important
person.
he's
an
officer
of
an
important
corporation,
and
the
judge...
show
me
why
we
should
take
that
person's
deposition.
now,
you
don't
have
to
prove
anything
beyond
a
preponderance.
you
need
to
show
some
reasonable
facts
that
can
be
learned
from
that
person.
in
this--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--but
it...
it
could
turn
out
to
be
appealable.
the
chances
of
them
showing
prejudice
are
limited,
but
it's
the
same
kind
of
situation.
the
plaintiff
here
is
trying
to
obtain
some
evidence,
and
here
it's
actually
the
crucial
evidence
so
that
in
my
discovery
analogy,
it
wouldn't
work
for...
it
wouldn't
work
for
garden-variety
discovery,
but
if
we
had
a
major
witness
and
a
major
point,
that
issue
might
show
up
as
a...
as
the...
as
the
issue
on
which
an
appeal
turned.
here
the
information
we're
trying
to
find
is...
goes
to
the
guts
of
the
question
of
racial
discrimination.
it
goes
to
the
reason
that
the
prosecutor...
the
reason
for
the
prosecutor's
challenge.
the
trial
judge
has
to
decide
whether
there
is
a
race-neutral
reason
and
whether
that
was
in
fact
the
prosecutor's
reason
and
whether
that
reason
was
credible.
none
of
that
can
be
determined
unless
we
know
the
prosecutor's
reason.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
i
can't
see
anything
remotely
obvious
here,
your
honor,
between
the
state
judges
and
the
attorney...
state
attorney
general's
office
has
speculated
as
to
two
reasons
for
challenges
to
clodette
turner.
they
speculated
as
to
five
possible
reasons
for
the
challenges
to
sara
edwards,
and
they
speculated
on
eight
possible
reasons
for
the
challenges
to
ruby
lanere.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
if
it
was
so
obvious,
they
wouldn't
have
15
speculations.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
the
prosecutor
is,
and
then
the
defense
gets
to
argue,
as
one
does
in
a
title
vii
case,
that
there
is
something
wrong
with
that
answer
which
therefore
shows
prejudice.
perhaps
the
prosecutor
has
said
i
challenge
this
juror
because
in
voir
dire,
the
juror
said
he
was...
i
believe
the
juror
was
illiterate.
and
it
turns
out
the
question
was,
mr.
juror,
how
do
you
get
your
news?
from
the
newspaper
or
television?
and
the
juror
said,
i
get
it
from
television.
and
the
prosecutor
thought
that
showed
illiteracy.
if
that's
the
test
for
literacy,
then
two-thirds
of
our
population
is
illiterate.
that's
why
we
need
to
get
the
reasons.
the...
the
defense
is
not
bound
by
it.
the
defense
is
entitled
to
show
that
the
reason
may
be
pretextual.
sometimes
it
will
be.
sometimes
it
will
not.
but
unless
the...
the
whole
guts
of
title
vii
where
the
employer
always
gives
a
reason
is
trying
to
show
in
one
way
or
another
from
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
all
the
evidence
that
the
reason
is
pretextual.
and
that
should
apply
in...
in...
under
batson
in
the
same
way.
but
one
cannot
evaluate
from
either
position,
from
the
defense
position
or
the
prosecution
position,
whether
the
reason
is
pretextual
unless
one
hears
the
reason.
and
if--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--we
are...
most
of
the
time
the...
the
prosecutors
are
going
to
have
race-neutral
reasons.
all...
all
we're
doing
is
asking
for,
to
check
for
the
unusual
circumstance
when
the
reason
is
not
race-neutral
or
when
the
reason
is
pretextual.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
a
peremptory
challenge--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--a
peremptory--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--a
peremptory
challenge
is
valid
for
any
reason
except
an
unconstitutional
reason.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
when
this
court
considered
batson,
the
argument
made
by
the
state
is
we
have
a
peremptory
challenge
statute
which
is
very
important
and
you
shouldn't
just
brush
it
aside.
and
this
court
decided
in
batson,
yes,
peremptory
challenge
statutes
are
important,
but
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
u.s.
constitution
are
even
more
important,
and
as
in
the
conflict
between
those
two,
the
equal
protection
clause,
which
is
preventing
racial
discrimination,
which
is
protecting
the
rights
of
the
individual
jurors
not
to
be
discriminated,
which
is
protecting
the
right
of
the
defendant
not
to
be
tried
by
a
jury
chosen
with
discrimination,
and
which
is
protecting
the
rights
of
the
public
not
to
have
the
criminal
system
upset
by
discrimination,
the...
this
court
in
batson
decided
that
the
equal
protection
clause
under...
trumps
the
right
for--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--i
would
say
any...
i
would
say
a...
the...
i
don't
want
to
put
you...
your
honor
in
those
shoes,
but
a
prosecutor...
we've
never
seen
a
prosecutor
not
have
a
reason.
so
if
you...
so
if
you
were
the
prosecutor
and
you
said,
i
have
a
hunch,
the
trial
judge
would
probably
ask,
counsel,
please
i
need
more
than
a
hunch.
please
give
me
the
reason
for
your
hunch.
and
your
answer
is
i
don't
like
jurors
who
have
beards,
i
don't
like
jurors
who
have
long
hair,
i
don't
like
postal
workers,
some
basis
for
the
hunch.
any
prosecutor
who
is
not
discriminating
would
have
a
basis
for
that
hunch.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
thank
you,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
the
prosecutor
preempted
all
three
african
american
jurors,
leaving
a
black
defendant
to
be
tried
before
an
all-white
jury
in
a
case
that
had
racial
issues.
if
this
court...
this
is
a
paradigm
of
a
prima
facie
case.
this
is
a
much
stronger
prima
facie
case
than
that
which
is
required
in
virtually
all
of
the
federal
courts.
if
this
court
does
not
reach
this
question
because
it
finds
something
that
still
is
alive
below,
i
respectfully
submit
that
this
court
would
be
sending
a
very
poor
message
to
the
state
courts
and
a
very
poor
message
to
the
federal
courts,
namely,
that
yes,
it
is
technically
in
error
but
it's
not
important
enough
for
us
to
decide.
i'd
respectfully
ask
the
court
to
reach
this
issue.
in
terms
of
what
would
happen
if
the
states...
at
the
state
court,
i
don't
think
i...
i
could
never
get
back
to
this
court
or
anywhere
else.
let
us
say
i
go
back
to
the
state
court
of
appeal.
the
state
court
of
appeal
rules
against
me
on
the
evidentiary
issues
and
says,
counsel,
on
the
batson
issue
we'd
like
to
rule
for
you
but
the
state
supreme
court
said
no,
so
we
can't
do
anything.
review
at
the
state
supreme
court
is
discretionary.
i
file
a
petition
for
review
and
the
state
supreme
court
says
we
decide
that...
we
already
decided
that.
we
don't
care.
get
out
of
here.
review
dismissed.
i
then
will
be
trying
to
come
to
this
court,
having
gotten
no
opinions
from
the
court
of
appeal,
having
gotten
a
postcard
denial
from
the
state
supreme
court
and
i
would
not
be
able
to
get
here.
i
think
that
will
be--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--if...
if
that
was
a
guaranteed
invitation,
your
honor,
i
would
accept
it.
[laughter]
but
odds
on
getting
to
this
court
aren't
quite
so
guaranteed
as--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--yes.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
we
don't
know.
every
time
around,
they
make
up
a
new
definition.
they
had
strong
likelihood.
they
had
not...
they
had
dispositive
inference.
they
had
conclusive
presumption.
this
time
we...
this
time
they
made
up
more
likely
than
not.
they
may
make
some
other
standard.
we
don't
know
what
they're
going
to
do,
and
it's
a...
it's
a
moving
target
and
it
is...
the
target
is
moving
in
the
direction
of
denying...
denying
consideration
of
these
cases
and
the
target
is
moving
in
the
direction
of
denying
the
opportunity
to
show
whether
or
not
there's
discrimination.
if
the
california
court's
standard
of
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
allowed
to
apply,
we
believe
that
will
eviscerate
batson
because
that
means
you
cannot
get
in
california
what
you
would
get...
at
least
eviscerate
batson
in
california
because
that
would
mean
you
cannot
get
in
california
what
you
could
get
anywhere
else
in
this
country
on
these
facts--
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
--that
is
possibly
true.
mr.
stephen
b.
bedrick
yes,
and
we
have
this
continuing
battle
where
counsel
is
required
to
spend
and
waste
enormous
amounts
of
time
going
back
and
forth
and
back
and
forth.
i
mean,
i
guess
this
case
could
become
my
career.
i'd
sort
of
ask
the
court--
[laughter]
--to
let
me
go
on
and...
i
want
to
represent
my
client,
but
i'd
ask
the
court
to
let
me
go
and
do
something
else.
in
conclusion,
i
would
ask
to
point
out
to
the
court
that
obtaining
the
reason
is
the
most
important
thing
we're
asking
here.
it's
very
simple.
most
of
the
time
it
will
solve
the
problem.
we
won't
be
bouncing
back
and
forth
between
courts.
discrimination
cannot
be
shown
unless
the
challenger's
reasons
are
known.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
decide
this
case
in
a
way
that
challenger's
reasons
become
known.
