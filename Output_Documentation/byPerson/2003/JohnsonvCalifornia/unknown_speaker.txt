unknown
speaker
well
now,
mr.
bedrick,
are...
are
you
talking
about
enough
evidence,
say,
to...
for
a
trial
judge
to
let
a
case
go
to
a
jury
or
enough
evidence
to
persuade
a
trial
judge
who's
sitting
as
the
finder
of
fact?
i
think
those
are
two
different
things.
unknown
speaker
so
it...
it
doesn't
have
to
be
proven
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
best
analog
that
you
have?
probable
cause
doesn't
seem
to
fit.
reasonable
suspicion,
reasonable
grounds
for
belief.
are...
are
there
cases
which
tell
us
what
little
semantic
formulation
you
want
to
use?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that's
not
the
standard
for
letting
a
case
go
to
the
jury,
though.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
that's
what
you're
appealing
to,
what
the
test
ought
to
be
is
not
whether
the
judge
thinks
it's
more
likely
than
not,
but
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
think
that
it's
more
likely
than
not.
surely
that's
the
standard
for
letting
a
case
go
to
the
jury,
not
a
suspicion.
you
know,
if
the
judge
thinks--
unknown
speaker
--he
has
to
say
a
reasonable
juror
could
find
that
it
is
more
likely
than
not
that
the
plaintiff's
case
is...
is
sustainable.
isn't
that
the
test
for
going
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
the
jury
has
to
find
it
by
a
preponderance.
unknown
speaker
but
in
order
to
let
it
go
to
the
jury,
i
had
always
thought
that
the
criterion
was
not
whether
the
judge
thought
it
was
more
likely
than
not
but
whether
in
his
view
a
reasonable
jury
could
think
it
more
likely
than
not.
unknown
speaker
okay.
you
had
a
model--
--of
course,
that
standard
applies
after
the...
after
the
case
has
been...
has
been
tried
and...
and
both
sides
have
had
an
opportunity
be
heard.
all...
all
you're
asking
for
is
the
opportunity
to
make
inquiry.
unknown
speaker
you're
asking
more
than
that.
you're
asking
under
our
law
that
if
the...
if
the
prosecutor
doesn't
come
back
with
a
reason,
you
win.
unknown
speaker
you're
not?
unknown
speaker
the...
the
prosecutor
can
stand
silent
and...
and...
and
the...
the
judge
can
still
find
against
you.
unknown
speaker
but
the
persuasion
burden
would
be
for
the
jury
if
you
submit
enough
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case.
the
title
vii
cases
deal
with
a
situation
where
you've
made
the
prima
facie
showing.
you
don't
necessarily
win
if
the
defendant
comes
up
with
a
nondiscriminatory
reason.
but
if
the
defendant
just
stands
silent...
you've
made
your
prima
facie
case.
defendant
says
nothing.
don't
you
win
at
that
point?
unknown
speaker
yes,
of
course,
but
suppose
the
employer
gives
no
reason.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
the
prosecutor
stands
silent.
those
are
all
cases
where
the
prosecutor
does
what
you
would
expect.
the
defendant
does
what
you
expect:
come
up
with
a
reason.
but
if
no
reason
is
given--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you...
you
were
asked
to
consider
what...
what
does
it
mean,
this
prima
facie
case,
if
the
defendant
does
stand
silent.
it
may
be
implausible
that
the
prosecutor
would
or
a
defendant
would
in
title
vii.
unknown
speaker
i...
i
suggest
that
the
reason
you've
never
come
across
a
case
in
which
the
prosecutor
stands
silent
is
because
the
prosecutors
know
that
if
they
stand
silent,
they
lose.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
at
all
inconceivable.
i
mean,
that...
that's
why
they
always
come
up
with
a
reason
because,
as
i
understand
the
way
we
formulated
our...
our
title
vii
test,
you...
you
have
to
come
up
with
an
excuse,
and
if
you
don't
have
an
excuse,
the
plaintiff
wins.
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
that,
but
that's
what
our
law
is.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
a
hypothetical
question?
i
hate
to
push
you
to
the
wall
on
it,
but
supposing
you
had
a
prosecutor
who
conducted
the
voir
dire
for
the
first
day
and
then
was
hit
by
a
truck
and
died
and
wasn't
able
to
continue
the
trial.
and
he
had
made
one
challenge
of
one
african
american
juror,
but
he
had
let
six
others
on
the
jury.
what...
what
would
you
do
with
that
case?
would
that
be
a
prima
facie
case
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
were
one
and
otherwise
it
was
an
all-white
jury?
unknown
speaker
i'm...
i'm
positing
a
case
in
which
for
reasons
beyond
the
control
of
the
prosecutor,
they
can't
tell
what
the
real
reason
was
of
the
man
who
conducted
the
voir
dire.
unknown
speaker
what
if
it
comes
up...
comes
up
on
appeal?
i
mean,
it's
happened.
in
the
case...
because
the
trial
judge
lets
the
case
go
forward.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
appellate
court
has
to
decide
whether...
whether
the
conviction
has
to
be
thrown
out--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
basis
of
a...
a
strike
that
the
appellate
court
has
no
way
of
finding
out
the
reason
for.
unknown
speaker
the
only
prospective
black
juror
was
struck.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
when
in
doubt?
i
mean,
isn't
it
enough
to
say
the
trial
judge
has
to...
can
find
that
there's
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
but
why
slant
it
one
way
or
the
other?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
how
it
works.
you
have
some
suspicion,
because
of
the
issues
in
the
case
and
so
forth
after
the
first
minority
juror
is
excused,
and
say
oh-oh,
there
may
be
something
going
on
here.
at...
at
what
point
under
california
procedure
do
you
think
you
should
make
the
objection?
at
the
earliest
possible
opportunity
when
they've
excused
the
first
minority
juror
or
you
wait
until
the
whole
jury
is
empaneled
and
ready
to
be
sworn?
how
does
that
work?
unknown
speaker
what
happened
here?
was
it
after
the
second
juror
or
after
the
first?
unknown
speaker
and
then
renewed
on
the
third.
unknown
speaker
and
under
your
procedure,
how
long
would
this
take?
you
say,
your
honor,
i
want
an
inquiry
into
why
this
juror
was
excused
and
the...
i
guess
the
judge
excuses
the...
the
panel,
or
the
prospective
panel,
and
then
says,
mr.
prosecutor,
can
you
tell
me
why
you
excused
the
jury.
is
that
the
way
it
works?
unknown
speaker
don't...
don't
they
just
go
up
to
the
bench?
do
they
have
to
excuse
the
whole
jury
panel?
unknown
speaker
what
happened
here?
unknown
speaker
and
the
trial
judge
did
what?
he
decided
on
his
own
that
there
were
good
reasons?
unknown
speaker
and
was
the
judge
asked
if
the
prosecutor
could
be
asked
to
explain?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
should
he--
--why
should
he?
--if
he's
already
been
told?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
counsel--
--in
the
law--
--before
you
exhaust
your
time
here,
on
appeal
did
you
challenge
also
an
evidentiary
point,
a
brady
claim?
unknown
speaker
there
are
other
issues
in
the
case.
unknown
speaker
the
brady
claim,
some
evidentiary...
and...
and
a
new
trial
was
granted
on
some
of
those
issues?
unknown
speaker
on
the
third
trial,
were
there
other
issues?
unknown
speaker
that
were
not
reached.
unknown
speaker
but
do
we
have
a
jurisdictional
problem?
do
we
have
a
final
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
sent
back.
wasn't
it
sent
back
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
well--
--and
you
may
win
on
two...
on
either
of
two
issues
that
are
left
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
on
three
of
those
issues.
isn't
it
the
case
that
the
intermediate
appellate
court
said
there's
something
going
for
your
side
on
those
three?
it's
kind
of
hinted
that
you
have
a
good
case
on
the
issues
that
didn't
get
decided.
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
a
firm
finality
rule.
so
how
can
we
if
the
judgment
that
you're
bringing
to
us
is
non-final?
unknown
speaker
we've
put
in
a
lot
of
time
on
it
too.
unknown
speaker
i...
i--
unknown
speaker
--we
understand
that
it's
a
good
case
to
address
the
issue,
but
only
if
there's
a
final
judgment
so
that
we
have
jurisdiction.
can
you
enlighten
us
any
more
on
that
jurisdiction
point?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
raised
now.
unknown
speaker
but
now
it
does
because
it's
been
reversed
and
there's
a
remand.
and
when
it's
remanded,
it
is
certainly
going
to
take
up
the
issues
that
it
left
undecided.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
been
instructed.
there...
there
are
exceptions
under
our
cox
case,
and
i've
looked
at
them.
i
don't
think
this
comes
under
them.
we
don't
like
to
ambush
you
this
way,
but
i
mean,
if
there's
a...
there's
a
real
jurisdictional
problem
here.
especially
since
we
gave
you
the
case
to...
to
argue.
you
are
very
kindly
appearing
here
pro
bono.
[laughter]
it
seems
like
a
dirty
trick.
no.
but
may
i
ask
on
the
finality
question?
is
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
final
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
the
batson
claim?
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
more
to
be
decided
relevant
to
that
issue.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that
is
relevant
to
that?
and
that
is,
that
california,
as
i
understand
it,
is
taking
the
position
each
state
is
free
to
implement
batson
as
it
chooses,
and
california
points
out
that
it
has
a
standard
that's
more
stringent
than
the
federal
standard
on
disqualifying
a
juror
for
race
bias.
the
california
standard
is
significant
likelihood
that
the
juror
is
biased,
where
the
federal
standard
is
a
reasonable
possibility.
so
california
says
if
we
can
have
a
more
stringent
standard
on
disqualifying
a
juror
for
race
bias,
why
can't
we
have
a
more
stringent
standard
on
batson.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
part
of
that
was
that
batson
leaves
room
for
the
states.
it
doesn't
require
every
state
to...
to
handle
batson
challenges
the
same
way.
i
think
that
is
an
argument
that
california
made.
unknown
speaker
more
a
question
for
the
state
than
for
you.
i...
i
can't
really
think
of
an
analog
here.
our
search
and
seizure
jurisprudence,
our
arrest
jurisprudence,
our
miranda
jurisprudence
is
all
uniform.
here,
of
course,
state
jury
selection
procedures
vary,
and
so
there
has
to
be
some
allowance
for
that.
on
the
other
hand,
i'm
not
sure
what
the
state
is
going
to
tell
me
so
far
as
a
helpful
analog
for
having
a
different...
different
rule.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
you're
talking
about
is
a
judgment
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
case,
aren't
you?
you're
not
talking
about
a
motion
to
dismiss
a
complaint
before
trial.
unknown
speaker
but
you...
you
do
have
some
difference
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
because
the
rule
is
that
if
any
conceivable
allegations
could
have
been
proved
in
support
of
what
the
complaint
says,
it
shouldn't
be
dismissed.
but
at
the
close
of
the
plaintiff's
evidence,
i
think
it's
a
little
more
stringent.
it's
what...
what
does
the
plaintiff's
evidence
show,
not
what
could
it
have
shown.
unknown
speaker
but
the
typical
discovery
motion
isn't
appealable,
so
there
isn't
much
writing
on
the
subject
of
what
sort
of
a
standard
should
apply
in
that
sort
of
discovery.
unknown
speaker
what
if...
what
if
the
trial
court
at
the
prima
facie
stage
says
it...
it
seems
perfectly
obvious
to
me...
and
i
think
this
is
perhaps
what
the
judge
here
did...
that
the
reason
the
prosecutor
did
this
was
thus
and
so.
and
then
the...
so
he
doesn't
call
on
the
prosecutor,
but
nonetheless,
it's
very
plausible
what
he
said.
now,
isn't
that
a
form
of
harmless
error?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what--
unknown
speaker
--what
if
the
prosecutor,
after
the
prima
facie
stage,
says
i
did
it
for
this
reason?
all
parties...
the...
the
defense
isn't
bound
by
that
statement,
is
it?
but
i
suppose
the
prosecutor
is.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose...
suppose
one
problem
that
is
more
difficult
in
the
batson
context...
we're
talking
about
a
reason
that
would
justify
a
peremptory
challenge,
not
a
challenge
for
cause.
and
i
imagine
that
a
good
judge
and
a
good
lawyer
could
come
up
with
that
kind
of
reason
for
almost
any
potential
juror.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
didn't
need
a
reason
for
a
peremptory
challenge.
i
thought
that's
the
beauty
of...
of
a
peremptory
challenge.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
there's
just
something
about
this
guy.
i
just...
you
know,
my
antennae
tell
me
that
this
person
isn't
going
to
be
good
for
my
side
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
that
enough
of
a
reason?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
what
i
said
wouldn't
suffice.
you
say
that
wouldn't
suffice
as
a
reason.
unknown
speaker
you
have
an
issue
that's
finally
decided
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
that
will
be
law
on
the
case.
but
you
don't
have
a
judgment,
a
final
judgment
in
the
case
because
now
there
are
all
those
issues
that
the
intermediate
appellate
court
said
it
left
open.
it
gave
some
hints
about
what
validity
it
thought
they
had,
but...
but
there
is...
there
are
a
number
of
issues
that
are
still
to
be
opened.
so
the
judgment
isn't
final.
only
one
issue
in
the
case
is.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question
about
the
california
standard?
is
it...
did
you
just
say
the
standard
is
the
judge
must
decide
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
there
was
discrimination?
or...
and
i
think
it
would
be
quite
different
to
say...
the
judge
must
decide
that
a
reasonable
juror
could
conclude
that
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
there
was
a...
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
the
latter.
unknown
speaker
and
why
shouldn't
it
be
the
latter?
unknown
speaker
in
your...
in
your
ordinary
civil
trials,
which
view
does
the...
is...
what
is
the
rule
in
california?
would...
would
it
be
the
one
i
stated
or
the
one
you
stated?
unknown
speaker
say
it's
a
tort
case
where
he
sued
for,
you
know,
negligence
in
driving
a
car.
which...
which
would
be
the
correct
statement
under
california
law?
unknown
speaker
do
i
let
the
case
go
to
the
jury?
that's
what's
before
him.
unknown
speaker
it's
whether
a
reasonable
jury
could
find
that
there
was--
unknown
speaker
--and
why
do
you
say
there's
a
distinction
here?
i...
i
understood
you
to...
to
say
that
the...
the
distinction
rests
on
the
fact
that
the...
at
the...
at
the
close
of...
of
whatever
argument
or
point
the...
the
defense
counsel
makes,
that
he's
entitled,
in
effect,
to...
to
win
the
point.
but
that's
not
so.
unknown
speaker
in
the
face
of
silence.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
further...
i
mean,
a
further
fact
in
evidence.
i
mean,
if...
if
somebody
puts
in
a...
a
permissive
case
in
a...
in
a
civil
action
and
the
defense
puts
in
nothing,
the...
the
jury
may
or
may
not
ultimately
award
for
the...
for
the
plaintiff.
they
may...
but
in...
in
this
case,
i
take
it
the
way
it
works,
there
is
a...
a
presumption
that
aids
the
objecting
party
and
therefore
the
objecting
party
wins.
is...
is
that
your
understanding?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
if
the...
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
prosecutor
does
make
a
response,
then
there's
no
presumption.
then
the...
the
judge
simply
has
to
make
a
determination.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
when
he
does
that,
he
may
very
well,
in
effect,
say,
yes,
there's
evidence
here
from
which
i
could
infer
discriminatory
intent,
but
i
don't
infer
it.
i
am
not
wholly
convinced
by
it
for
whatever
reason.
and
that's...
that's
a
possible
resolution
by
the
court,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
at...
at
the
last
stage,
the
trial
judge
is
acting
as
if
he
were...
it
were
a
bench
trial,
and
it's
up
to
him
to
decide
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
discriminatory
purpose.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
if
no
reasons
are
given,
it's
your
position
that
automatically
it's
determined
that
there's
a
constitutional
violation.
unknown
speaker
the
other
side
says
no.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
the...
the
position
that...
that
you
are
advocating,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
is
that
the
court
saves
the
prosecutor
that
burden
by
the
court,
before
turning
to
the
prosecutor,
to
say
what's
your
nondiscriminatory
reason.
the
court
itself
first
thinks
of
can
the
court
think
of
a
good
reason,
and
if
the
court
thinks
of
a
good
reason,
it
never
asks
the
prosecutor.
that's
the...
that's...
as
i
understand
your
case,
you
say
that's
how
it
works.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think...
suppose
there
were
12
peremptory
challenges
and
there
were
12
african
american
prospective
jurors
there
and
all
of
them
were
stricken.
is
there
enough
case
made
if
there's
an
objection
by
the
defense
counsel?
unknown
speaker
--in
my
example.
unknown
speaker
well,
so,
the
trial
judge
can
look
into
that
as
a
part
of
the
prima
facie
case.
he
can
look
into
what
the
jurors
responded?
unknown
speaker
suppose
i'm
the
trial
judge
and
i
consider,
you
know,
there
are
reasons
why
the
prosecutor...
legitimate
reasons
why
the
prosecutor
might
have
exercised
this
challenge.
do
i
go
further?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
the...
the
case
is
the
one
i...
i
gave
you.
there's
an
objection.
and
i
say,
you
know,
there
are
reasons
why
this
prosecutor
might
have
done
this.
do
i
quit
at
that
point
and
say,
well,
you
haven't
made
out
your
case?
that's
the
way
i
understand
the
california
rule,
incidentally.
if
there...
if
there
are
reasons
that
might
have
allowed
the
prosecutor
to
give
the
peremptory
challenge,
the
prima
facie
case
may
not
have
been
made
out.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
very
odd
that
he
would
do
that
without
even
asking
the
prosecutor
to
comment.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
odd
in
the
sense
that
california
is
one
of
the
only
states
that
does
it.
unknown
speaker
well...
no,
i
didn't
mean
to...
complete
your...
the...
the
problem
i
have
with...
with,
i
guess,
that
argument
and...
and
with
the
california
position
is
this.
i
assume
that
under
batson
when
and
if
the
time
comes
for
the
prosecutor
to
make
a
response,
we
want
a...
a
context
in...
in
which
the
prosecutor
at
least
has
got
a
fair
shake
to...
to
persuade
the
court.
and
on
the
california
system,
what
you're
defending,
the
judge
does
not,
in
effect,
as
the
prosecutor
for
a
response
until
the
judge,
in
effect,
has
already
found
against
him
on
the
merits
because
on
your
view,
the
prosecutor
has
said
implicitly,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
they
have
proven
discrimination.
anything
you'd
like
to
say
about
that?
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying,
this
side's
case
in
and
i
might
find
for
them,
but
i...
i
haven't
yet.
what
do
you
have
to
say?
it...
it
in
effect
on...
on
the
california
scheme
forces
the...
the
court
to
say
i've
already
ruled
against
you
based
on
the
merits
unless
you
say
something.
unknown
speaker
but
it
puts
the
prosecutor
in
a...
in
rather
a
difficult
spot
if...
if
you
get
to
that
point.
unknown
speaker
because
the
prosecutor
has
already
been
told
you
lose
unless
you've
got
a
darned
good
reason.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
it
seems
to
me--
--no.
--the
opposite
is
also
true
for
what
justice
souter
is
saying.
the...
the
judge
says,
you're
going
to
win
unless
you
say
something.
unknown
speaker
no.
so
i...
i...
in
that
instance,
he
obviously
says
nothing.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn't
say
you're
going
to
win.
he's
going
to
say
there
is
enough
to
require
you
to
respond.
whether...
whether
you
win
or
lose
is
up
to
me
after
the
response.
unknown
speaker
that
is
true
if
you've
got
a
presumption
working.
it
is
not
true
if
you
simply
have
a...
a
standard
that...
that
allows
for
the
permissive
inference.
if...
if
nothing
more
than
a
permissive
inference
is
involved
and
the
case...
and
the
defense
puts
in
no
case,
the
plaintiff
may
or
may
not
win.
the
only
thing
that
makes
the
difference
is...
is
whether
a
presumption
operates
to
convert
the
permissive
case
into
a
victory,
and
whether
the
presumption
is
going
to
operate
or
not
is
a
question
of...
of
policy.
it's
not
a
question
of
logical
relationships.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question
just
to
be
sure
i...
i
have
your
position?
the
other
side
says
california
is
the
only
state
in
the
union
that
follows
this
strict
a
rule
and
the
federal
courts
all
follow
the...
the
other
rule.
are
they
right
on
that,
or
do
you
think
they're...
you
have
company
in
other
parts
of
the
country?
unknown
speaker
the
legislature
overturned
it
in
connecticut.
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
anyway,
it's
no...
connecticut
is
not
out
of
line
anymore.
unknown
speaker
but
in
title
vii
there
would
be
a
presumption
if
the
employer
said
nothing.
if
the...
if
the
plaintiff
shows
the
mcdonnell
douglas
factors
and
the
employer
doesn't
come
up
with
any
reason
at
all,
i
thought
at
that
point,
plaintiff
wins
because
there's
a
reasonable
inference,
plus
presumption.
plaintiff
wins.
when
defendant
comes
forward
with
a
nondiscriminatory
reason,
then
the
presumption
drops
out
of
the
case.
plaintiff
shoulders
the
burden
of
persuasion.
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
that...
that
this
title
vii,
the
idea
of
reasonable
inference
plus
presumption...
that
that's
supposed
to
be
the
formula
for
batson
as
well.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
he
said
that
the
presumption
operates
in
the
run...
mine
run
of
cases,
it's
the
presumption
that
the...
what
you
call
the
strong
evidence
test...
that's
batson
for
special
instances
and
it
isn't
the
dominant
rule.
unknown
speaker
the...
the
problem
with...
with
this
is,
though,
is
that,
say,
in
the
employment
discrimination
case,
there's
been
discovery.
the
events
have
happened
outside
the
hearings
of
the
court.
there
has
been
time
to
look
at
it.
here
the
alleged
wrong
is
occurring
right
in
the
courtroom
in
front
of
the
judge.
and
so
all
they're
saying
is
that
the
judge
should,
in
an
appropriate
case,
say,
hey,
what's
going
on
here,
mr.
prosecutor.
that's
all.
and...
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
very,
very
minimal
intrusion
on...
on
the
trial.
and
the...
the
state
of
california's
rule
seems
to
presume
that
the
defense
counsel,
if...
if
he's
the
one
objecting,
has
the
resources
of
discovery
and...
and
the
opportunity
to...
to
reflect
and...
and
to
find
other
evidence.
he
doesn't.
the
jury
is
being
selected
now.
unknown
speaker
everything
the
party
needs
except
the
state
of
mind
of
the
prosecutor,
and
the--
unknown
speaker
--of
course,
the
irony
of
that
is
that
if...
if
you
had
an
ordinary
civil
lawsuit
and
the
plaintiff
files
a
complaint
on
information
and
belief...
i
have
good
faith
and
belief
such
and
such
happened...
then
he
takes
a
deposition
and
asks
the
defendant
did
it
happen.
but
here
you
can't
do
that.
you
got
to
know
the
answer
to
what
your
information
and
belief
is
before
you
file
your
complaint.
unknown
speaker
is
it
appropriate
in
a
case
like
this
to
weigh,
on
the
one
hand,
the
importance
of
the
interests
that
are
protected
by
the
batson
rule
and,
the
other
hand,
the
burden
on
the
prosecutor
by
having
to
answer
the
question?
is
that
an
important
part
of
the
analysis?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
there
are
those...
i
remember
justice
marshall
used
to
take
the
position
that
it
would
be
better
for
the
system
as
a
whole
if
we
entirely
abandoned
peremptories
because
you...
you're
better
off
if
you
always
know
what
the
reason
is.
at
least
that's
a
permissible
view.
unknown
speaker
but
they...
most...
most
jurisdictions...
most
courts
that
considered
this
issue
have
the
reasonable
inference
and
that
gives
rise
to
the
presumption.
california
is
in
a
minority.
are
you
saying
that
california
is
right
and
everyone
else
is
wrong?
or
that
you're
both
right?
unknown
speaker
whatever.
there
is
a
divergence.
unknown
speaker
now,
are
you
saying
there
is
only
one
right
way
and
that's
california's,
or
are
you
saying
it's
up
to
the
states?
they
can
have
one
rule
or
the
other.
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean...
procedures
to
govern...
that
one
state
can
have
reasonable
inference
gives
rise
to
presumption
and
in
another,
as
california,
can
have
strong
likelihood?
unknown
speaker
because
you...
you
said
something
about
one
of
the
reasons
you're
resisting
this
is
it
may...
it
prolongs
the
trial
and
you
have
to
clear
the
jury
and
the...
in
the...
the
places
that
have
reasonable
inference
plus
presumption,
has
there
been
this
slowing
down,
the
clogging
of
the
court?
has...
has
what
you're
predicting
played
out
in
reality?
unknown
speaker
i...
i
did...
the
question
i
asked
you
was
just
a
purely
practical
one.
has
what
you
predicted
as
the
adverse
consequences,
if
you
loosen
up
the...
what
the
plaintiff
has
to
show...
what
the
defendant
has
to
show...
and
my
understanding
is
that...
that
it
hasn't
been
a
big
problem
in
the
federal
courts,
in
states.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
california
handle
a
challenge
for
cause?
does
it
clear
a
courtroom
every
time
someone
makes
a
challenge
to
cause?
does
it
call
counsel
up
to
the
bench
to
give
their
reasons
simply
to
the
judge
on
the
record
or
some
third
way?
how
does...
how
does
it
handle
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
this...
couldn't
the
same
thing
be
done
on...
on
a
batson
challenge?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
it
be?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
bedrick...
or
rather,
mr.
schalit.
mr.
bedrick,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
yes,
you
would.
you'd
have
a--
--we'll
be
waiting.
[laughter]
you'd
have
a
decision
from
the
highest
court
in
the
state
that
has
ruled
on
it,
and
you
could...
you
could
come
here.
you
would
have
then...
let's
say
you
have
a
judgment
affirming
the
conviction.
you
could
come
here
from
that.
unknown
speaker
we
will...
we
will
already
have
done
the
work.
your
odds
are
better
than
most
people.
[laughter]
so
will
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
importantly,
we
know
what
the
california
supreme
court's
final
word
is
on
it
already.
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
they
can
get
it
from
the
ninth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
it's
definitely
true.
hasn't
the
ninth
circuit
disagreed
with
the
california
supreme
court?
