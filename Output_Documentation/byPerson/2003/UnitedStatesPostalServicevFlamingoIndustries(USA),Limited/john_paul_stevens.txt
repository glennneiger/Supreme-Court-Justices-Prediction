justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
is
this...
section
201
of
title
39
says,
there
is
established
as
an
independent
establishment
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
of
the
united
states
the
united
states
post
office.
was
that
in
the
statute
before
the
reorganization
or
is
that
part
of
the
reorganization?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me,
mr.
kneedler,
this
is
an
argument
that
you
don't
have
an
antitrust
violation
here,
but
we're
concerned
with
the
problem
of
whether
you
had
a
classic
violation,
say
they
agreed
with
somebody
else
on
the
prices
they
would
charge
for
advertising
the
olympics
or
something
like
that,
where
you
had
a
clear...
here
you
don't
have
it
clear.
i
think
it's
arguable
whether
the
alleged
violation...
but
that's
not
the
issue
before
us.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
about
a
breach
of...
infringement
of
patents,
for
example?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
infringement
of
copyrights
and
so
forth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
there
was
a...
one
of
these
antitrust
violations
that
involved
abuses
of
patents
in
order
to
extend
a
monopoly
or
something
like
that,
that
could
be
a
classic
antitrust
violation.
but
you
say
there
are
other
federal
remedies
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
can
i
ask
you
a
basic
question
i
just
kind
of
forgotten
that
i
thought
i
knew
about,
but
i
thought
the
postal
service
had
a
monopoly
of
the
business
of
delivering
letters
and
packages,
and
that
these
competing
services
are
only
allowed
to
exist
by
some
special
privilege
granted
by
the
postal
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
for
parcel,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
do
you
do
with
the
statutory
language
that
it's
an
establishment
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
of
the
united
states?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't...
excuse
me...
i
didn't
think
it
had
a
mandate
to
make
money.
i
thought
the
statute
had
ordered
it
to
break
even.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it...
but
it's
unlike
most
profit-making
institutions
that
are
primarily
engaged
in
trying
to
make
as
much
money
as
they
can.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
there's
one...
one
sticking
point
that...
running
through
my
mind.
the
fact
that
they
had
to
waive
the
immunity
in
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
suggest
that
they're
a
sovereign.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
a
sovereign.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
if
you're
right,
they're
subject
to
criminal
liability
under
the
sherman
act
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
criminal
case
with
the
united
states
against
the
united
states
postal
service.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
won't
sell
you
any
stamps
unless
you
buy
our
greeting
cards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
might
happen,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
so
greeting
cards?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
fact
that
it's
only...
the
fact
that
it's
only
1
percent
means
they're
only
liable
under
the
antitrust
laws
for
1
percent
of
their
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they're
the
services
that
they
want
to
bring
suits
under.
