mr.
harold
j.
krent
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
justice
scalia
noted,
congress
launched
the
postal
service
into
the
commercial
world
in
1970,
authorizing
it
to
compete
in
any
market
of
its
own
choosing,
and
this
new
commercial
entity
fits
comfortably
within
the
term,
person,
under
the
antitrust
laws
for
at
least
four
distinct
reasons.
first,
this
is
unlike
any
other
federal
entity
in
the
fact
that
the
postal
service
has
been
authorized
to
decide
which
markets
it
wants
to
compete
into.
it's
not
competing
in
order
to
fulfill
a
specific
congressional
mission,
but
rather
to
compete
in
order
to
break
even
to
make
money.
second,
congress
has
directed
the
postal
service
enter
these
markets
with
scant
regulatory
oversight.
the
apa,
the
postal
rate
commission,
the
federal
acquisition
regulations,
all
do
not
apply
when
the
postal
service
is
acting
under
its
non-monopoly
powers.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
in
many
other
contexts,
though,
it's
clear
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
postal
service
should
be
distinct
from
the
united
states,
the
franchise
tax
opinion,
the
loeffler
decision,
and
i
think
the
other...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
neither
are
involved
in
separate
cause
of
action,
but
both
involve
this
court's
recognition
that
the
postal
service
is
not
the
same
as
united
states
and
should
be
treated
differently.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i
think
it
is
an
establishment
of
the
executive
branch,
and
it
keeps
some
kind
of
connection
to
the
united
states,
and
so,
for
instance,
congress
evidently
cared
about
the
fact
that,
given
the
monopoly
given
over
letter
mail,
that
there
would
be
some
tie.
i
mean,
the...
the
president
cannot,
can
neither
appoint
nor
discharge
the
postmaster
general,
but
yet
there
is
some
link
between
the
president
and
the
postal
service.
yet
financially,
the
postal
service
is
independent.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
there...
there
is,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
individual
who's
so-called
under
the
statute
the
executive
official
of
the...
of
the
united
states,
and
that
individual
is
to...
is
also
a
member
of
the
board
of
governors
of
the
postal
service
and
is
to
direct
and
execute
the
business
operations
of
the
postal
service.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
chosen
by
the
board
of...
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that,
again,
evans
is
the
separation
or
the
insulation
of
the
postal
service
from
direct
executive
branch
control.
but
financially,
as
i
mentioned,
the
debts
of
the
postal
service
are
not
the
debts
of
the
united
states.
any
kind
of...
of
recovery
against
the
postal
service
does
not
come
from
the
judgment
fund,
it
comes
from
the
postal
service
fund.
again,
these
two
things
reflect
the
fact
that
the
budget,
as
well
as
the
overall
financial
structure
of
the
postal
service,
is
independent.
and...
and
the
fourth
reason,
your
honor,
of
why
the
postal
service
is
a
distinct
entity
is...
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
sue-and-be-sued
clause
that
differentiates
this
case
from
the
sea-land
case,
in
which
there
was
no
sue-and-be-sued
clause.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
no,
your
honor,
and
indeed,
we
think
though
that
the...
these
four
factors
together
amply
demonstrate
that
this
is
a...
there
is
a
congressional
intent
that
the
postal
service
be
considered
a
separate,
distinct
entity
that
can
qualify
under
the
term,
person,
in
antitrust
laws.
and
indeed,
this
is
not
an
unadorned
sue-and-be-sued
clause.
congress
sat
and
thought
about
the
ramifications
of
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
and
thought
about
what
specific
limitations
should
be
grafted
on
to
the
waiver
of
immunity.
it
decided
to
make
sure
the
postal
service
complied
with
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
it
wanted
to
make
sure
that
the
postal
service,
despite
the
distinction
with
the
united
states,
viewed
its
own...
had
different
venue...
had
the
same
venue.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
indeed
it's
the
fact
that
the
antitrust
laws
say
that
every
person
should
be
subject
to
the
anti-competitive
measures,
or
pro-competitive
measures,
in...
in
the
statutes.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
cooper
case
must
be
looked
at
in
the
structure
of
the
decision
itself,
because
the
cooper
court
was
very
clear
to
limit
its
decision.
it
said
that
person
did
not
equal
united
states
because
of
the
fact
that
there
were
other
remedies
given
to
the
united
states
explicitly
in
the
act,
and
indeed,
that
that
conformed
to...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
it
didn't
matter
your
honor,
because
there
was
no
waiver
of
immunity.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
believe
that
it
was
clear,
because...
but,
again,
i
think
that
nobody
tried
to
avail
themselves
of
that
remedy
because
the
united
states
had
not
waived
its
immunity.
but
this
court
extended
the
notion
of
the...
of
person,
and
to
as
broad
as
possible,
including
states,
including
foreign
governments,
as
well
as
associations
and
public
corporations.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
so
that's
right
in
the...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
we
have
no
quarrel...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
agree
that
it's
in
the
opinion,
your
honor,
but
this
court,
in
georgia
v.
evans,
and
this
court
in
pfizer,
made
clear
to
cast
the
cooper
decision
in
the
light
of
the
fact
that
it
was
a
narrow
decision,
predicated
not
specifically
on
that
point,
your
honor,
but
rather
on
the
notion
that
there
was
an
election
of
remedies,
the
fact
that
the
united
states
could
sue
to
seize
property
under
the
act,
the
united
states
could
pursue
criminal
penalties
under
the
act,
and
that
linguistically,
the
united
states
doesn't
seem
to
fit
in
within
the
terms,
an
organization
or
association
existing
under
the
law
as
the
united
states.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
not
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor.
however,
the
department
of
justice
in
1977
and
again
in
1978,
made
findings
suggesting
that
the
postal
service
was
likely
to
be
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct.
it
was
soon
after
the
enactment
of
the
1970
statutes.
and
indeed,
there
are
other
entities,
such
as
the
tennessee
valley
authority,
which
has
been
found
to
be
a
person
under
the
antitrust
acts,
but
i
think
it's...
the
fact
that
this
is
rising,
this
question
arises
under
the
postal
services
is
no
surprise,
because
the
postal
service
has
a
roving
mandate
to
decide
to
go
into
the
business
of
greeting
cards
in
competition
to
hallmark,
to
go
into
the
fact
that
it
can
sell
bicycling
gear,
to
go
into
the
market
of
the
package
industry,
to
go
into
the
market
of
calling
cards
and
compete
against
at&t.
there
is
no
other
federal
entity
to
my
knowledge
which
has
this
kind
of
roving
mandate
to
make
money
from
congress,
and
indeed,
it
has
used
this
ability...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
it
has
a
statute...
it...
it's...
it's
a
rough
balance.
it's
unclear
whether
it's
supposed
to
make
a
little
money
or
lose
a
little
money.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
in
the
non-postal
activities,
the
only
objective
is
to
make
money.
certainly
for
universal
service
there
are
other
objectives
limiting
and
challenging
the
actions
of
the
postal
service,
but
with
respect
to
selling
bicycling
gear
or
selling
greeting
cards,
the
only
objective
the
postal
service
has
is
to
make
money,
and
it
has
tried
to
use
this
power,
and
indeed,
there
were
surpluses,
as
mentioned
by
counsel
for
the
solicitor
general,
in
several
years.
so
the
postal
service
can
be
successful
at
least
at
times,
but
other
times,
of
course,
especially
after
9/11,
it
has
seen
hard
times.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i
think
that's...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
think
it...
it's...
there
is
no
shareholders,
for
instance,
looking
for
a
profit,
but
the
goal
of
the
postal
service
in
these
other
areas
of
business,
whether
it's
the
package
business
or
the
greeting
card
business,
is
to
make
money.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
not...
not
the
rest
of
the
government
at
all,
because
there
is
a
segregated
fund.
but
it
is
there
to...
to
make
sure
that
any
kind
of
losses
that
the
postal
service
may
sustain
in
its
monopoly
business
can
be
overcome
by
profits
generated
in
the
non-monopoly
business.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
absolutely.
the...
the
congress
has
been
very
clear
that
there
is
a
monopoly
business
to
be...
to
be
pursued
here,
and
the
postal
service
is
pursuing
that.
but
that's
not
what
the
postal
service
is
only
about.
the
postal
service
is
also
constructed
as
a
business,
and
that's
what
this
court
has
recognized
in
franchise
tax
and
in
loeffler
case,
and
according
to
that
business
principles,
is
pursuing
other
tasks
as
well.
indeed,
congress...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
it's
a
corporation-like
form,
your
honor,
and
indeed...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
mean,
the
postal
service
has
described
itself
as
a
corporation.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
it's...
it's
a
board
of
directors-type
organization
with
the
board
of
governors
serving
as
a
type
of
board
of
governors...
as
a
board
of
directors...
and
the
board
of
governors,
as
mentioned
earlier,
chooses
the
head
or
the
chief
executive
officer
of,
or
the
postmaster
general,
of
the
postal
service
itself.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
mean,
it
is...
has
a
distinct
structure,
but
i
think
that
the
congress
that
launched
the
postal
service
in
the
business
and
suggested
that
the
postal
rate
commission,
the
apa,
and
the
federal
acquisition
regulations
wouldn't
apply,
would
not
have
wanted
then
the
postal
service
to
use
any
kind
of
monopoly
powers
to
have
a
tying
arrangement
with
an
entity
such
as,
you
know,
emery
air
freight
or
federal
express,
it
wouldn't
wanted
to
have...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
congress
has
already
made
that
judgment
by
suggesting
that
the
postal
service
have
the
right
to
be
sue
and
be
sued,
suggesting
the
postal
service...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
sure.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
right.
the...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
sure,
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
postal
service
fits
within
the
term,
person.
we
know
under
the
antitrust
laws,
we
know
that
person
can
be
applied
to
public
corporations,
as
this
court
has
held.
we
know
that
person
can
be
applied
to
states,
as
this
court
has
held.
we
know
that
person
can
be
applied
to
foreign
governmental
entities,
as
this
court
has
held.
so
the
only
question
is
whether
this
person
can
also
apply
to
federal
governmental
entities,
and
we
think
that
it's
clear
that
some,
but
very
few,
governmental
entities
would
qualify
under
the
term,
person.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
absolutely.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i...
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
fully
agree
with
that.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
full
agree
with
that,
and
i
think
we
can
discharge
that
burden
if
you
look
at
the
fact
that
the
postal
service
is
financially
independent,
it's
administratively
independent,
it
doesn't
have
to
comply
with
the
pro-competitive
measures
and
the
federal
acquisitions
regulations,
it
has
a
sue-and-be-sued
clause.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
they
are
the
only
employees
in
the
entire
government
to
my
knowledge
that
must
comply
with
the
taft-hartley
law,
and
indeed,
congress
specified
that
it
must
comply
within
the
law,
because
it
wanted
them
to
act
more
like
a
business
and
not
have
this
restrictures
of
other
organizations
within
the
united
states
as
they...
following
the
fellow
labor
relations
authority,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
believe
it's
the
american
postal
workers
union,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
yes.
so
it's
a...
it's
a
separate...
they're
separated
again
from
the
government
with
respect
to
labor
relations.
and
indeed,
they
are
one
of
the
few
governmental
entities
that
have
signified
their
own
operations
under
www-dot...
dot-com.
all
right,
they
have
decided
not
to
become
a
governmental
player.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct.
and
that's
part
and
parcel,
i
think...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
because...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
don't...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i
think
it's
important
to
think
about
what
the
postal
reorganization
act
does
say.
when
it
waives
immunity,
it
makes
limitations.
the
limitations
are
that
the
postal
service
must
comply
with
the
limitations
in
the
federal
tort
claims
act,
that
it
has
a
different...
the
same
venue
provisions
as
by
the
united
states,
and
that
it
has
some
of
the
jurisdictional
qualities
as
the
united
states,
though
the...
so
the
limitations
and
ramifications
of
the
waiver
are
grafted
in
section
409
very
clearly.
there
is
no
other
limitation,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
realize...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
we
agree
that
they're
part
of
government,
your
honor.
there's
never
been
any
kind
of
question
about
the
fact
that
the
postal
service
is
part
of
the
government.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
and...
yes,
your
honor.
and
it
takes...
takes
part
of
the...
in
the...
in
the
sense
that
it
would
have
immunity,
but
for
the
waiver,
clearly
because
congress
created
the
entity,
and
therefore
congress
decides
whether
to
waive
the
immunity.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
so
are
states
theoretically,
as
well
as
cities.
i
don't
think
that
would
ever
arise,
but
that
is
at
least
a
theoretical
possibility
and
this
court
has
averted
to
that
in
prior
decisions
as
well.
the
same
thing
is
true,
of
course,
for
cities
under...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i
don't
think
that's
likely
to
happen,
your
honor,
but
i
think
it's
important
that
this...
this
waiver
allows
the
postal
service
also
to
vindicate
its
own
interests,
right.
but
for
this
waiver,
postal
service
could
not
go
in
and
sue
for
any
kind
of
antitrust
injuries,
and
that's
not
clear.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
would
have
made
this
case
go
away.
but
congress
chose
not
to
follow
that
path,
and
indeed,
if
one
could
think
that
one
launches
a...
an
organization
into
the
commercial
marketplace
and
takes
away
the
constraints
of
the
apa,
the
far,
the
postal
rate
commission...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i
think
it's
now
for
the
monopoly
business,
your
honor,
but
the
launching
with...
with
respect
to
the
package
delivery
business,
the
greeting
card
business,
the
fact
that
they
are
sponsoring
lance
armstrong's
bicycling
team,
these
are
all
the
areas
in
which
the
postal
service
has
decided
to
venture
outside
of
its
mandate,
and
it's...
the
danger
is
allowing
the
postal
service
to
extend
its
monopoly
power
into
these
new
fields.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
no...
no...
if
i
understand
your...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
not
right,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
all
these
different
areas,
the
postal
rate
commission
does
not
operate
whatsoever.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
no
jurisdiction.
the
postal
service...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
oh,
overall,
your
honor,
but
the
postal
rate
commission
has
no
jurisdiction
whatsoever
on
the
postal
service's
actions
with
respect
to
greeting
cards,
bicycling
gear,
and
the
package
delivery
business.
and
i
think
that
points
out
the
danger
of
the
monopoly
practices.
one
could
easily
see...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
absolutely
none.
and
indeed,
if
there
was
a
tying
arrangement
of
trying
to
say,
if
you
want
our
postal
services
then
you
have
to
buy
our
greeting
cards,
to
follow
your
example,
no
remedy
whatsoever
there
as
well,
so
that
all
these
kinds
of
fear
of
predatory
pricing,
tying
arrangements,
monopolistic
prices,
the...
there's
a
danger...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
you
might,
unless
it
was
a
tying
agreement,
your
honor.
if
it
was
just
the
universal,
unilateral
action
of
the
postal
service
with
a
tying
arrangement,
there
would
be
no
remedy.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
you
never
know.
one
never
knows.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
indeed,
that...
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
indeed,
the
difference
in...
in
sea-land
is
the
fact
that
the
alaska
airlines
never
had
a...
never
had
to
argue
that
they
were
separate
from
the
united
states.
their
argument
was
that
the
united
states
could
be
sued
for
its
proprietary
activities
under
the
sherman
act.
they
didn't
argue
that
they
were
a
distinct
entity,
so
they
never
said
that...
there
was
no...
they
agreed
that
there
was
no
sue-and-be-sued
clause,
and
so
that
whole
argument
that
we're
making
in
this
case
was
never
even
raised
in
sea-land.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
of
the
court's
holding
that
the
alaska
airlines
did
not
qualify
under
the
term
person
under
the
antitrust
laws.
and
it's
our
contention,
because
the
postal
service
is
not
structured
anywhere
like
the
alaska
airlines,
because
it's...
alaska
airlines
did
not
have
a
separate
budget,
the
alaska
airlines
could
not
sue
and
be
sued,
the
alaska
airlines
had
to
comply
with
the
apa,
unlike
the
postal
service,
that
the
postal
service
is
a
person,
whereas
the
alaska
airlines
and
the
sba
and
the
department
of
commerce
and
hud
would
not
be
persons
under
the
antitrust
law.
so
it's
a
very
narrow
argument
predicated
on
the
structure...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i'm
sorry...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
except
for
the
postmaster
and
the
deputy
postmaster.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
by
the
senate,
sure.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i've
never
seen
their
license
plates,
your
honor,
but
i'm...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
we're
focusing
on
the
20
percent
we
agree...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
they're
not
burlap,
but
yes,
they
are...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
they
are
sacks.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
sure.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
they
are
used
for
international
mail,
for
third-class
mail.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
agree
with
you,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i
think
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
think
it
would
because
i
think
the
argument
here...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
i
think
that
what...
actually
that
they
probably
do,
but
the...
the...
the
gravamen
here
is
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
to
monopolize
the
mail
sack
business,
as
well
as
the...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
of
course
there
was.
don't
they
have
a
right
to
monopolize
the
mail
sack
business
or
not?
isn't
there
some...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
no.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
we
don't
believe
that's
part
of
the...
the
monopoly...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
there...
there
is
a
procurement
claim
pending,
your
honor,
but
the
postal
rate
commission
would
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the...
the
mail
sack
purchase
at
all,
your
honor.
and
so
the...
the
fear
is
that
these
kind
of...
of
trade
practices
that
are
anti-competitive
can
go
on
without
any
kind
of
direct
restraint.
certainly
there
is
an
overlap
between
procurement
and
antitrust,
but
it's
not
congruent
in
that
sense.
i
think
it's
helpful
to
think
about
what
congress
intended
by
waiving
the
postal
service's
immunity
in
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause.
clearly
it
has
to
apply
to
something.
there
was
some
point
in
waiving
the
immunity
of
the
postal
service.
we
know,
for
instance,
at
least
i
think
that
the
government
has
conceded,
that
the
postal
service
is
now
subject
to
torts
at
state
law
torts.
the...
franchise
tax
suggested
that
the
government...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
but
the
waiver
was
for
torts
and
then
the
limitation
in
the
waiver
said
that
the
procedures
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
must
be
applied,
but
clearly
there's
a
waiver...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
that's
correct,
just
as
it
would
be
in
any...
for
other
federal
entity,
but,
for
instance,
the...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
it
could
be,
except
for
the
fact
that
the...
the
limitations
of
the
federal
tort
claims
act
apply
by
virtue
of
409.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well
then...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i'm
sorry
if
i
misunderstood
your
question,
your
honor,
but
the...
the
argument
then
is
that...
that
in
other
kinds
of
cases,
such
as
the
state
law
that
said
person
in
the
franchise
task...
tax...
whether
that...
the
question
is
whether
that
applies
to
the
postal
service
as
well,
and
of
course
in
this
court,
upheld
the
determination
that
the
postal
service
would
comply
under
the
term
person
under
the
state
law
as
well.
so
how
far
does
person
apply?
contract
law,
tort
law,
what
about
the
lanham
act,
the
trademark
case?
before
the
recent
amendments
to
the
lanham
act
that
were
mentioned
recently,
the...
all
the
statute
said
was
that
it
was
applied
to
persons,
and
three
courts
of
appeals
suggested
that
even
though
person
could
not
apply
to
the
united
states,
person
could
apply
to
the
postal
service,
by
virtue
of
its
distinct
status.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
yes,
but
courts
had
said
that
the
united
states,
previous
to
that,
did
not
fall
within
the
term
person,
because
the
person
doesn't
refer
to
governmental
entities
at
all.
so
there
the
courts
had
distinguished...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
but
just
slightly,
your
honor.
the
only
difference
was
the
capable-of-being-sued
part.
the
united
states
is
also
capable
of
being
sued.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
but
the
united
states,
your
honor,
can
also
be
sued
and
is
capable
of
suing
itself,
so
i'm
not
sure
that
that
distinguishes
it,
and
indeed,
under
that
language,
courts
had
held
the
united
states
was
not
liable,
and
yet
the
postal
service
had
registered
trademarks
in
its
own
name,
the
postal
service
had
registered
copyrights
in
its
own
name,
even
though
the
united
states
cannot
hold
copyrights,
and
there
is
an
exception...
mr.
harold
j.
krent
well,
i
think
there
is
a
good
reason.
mr.
harold
j.
krent
and
indeed,
if
that
were
all
that
the
postal
service
had
filed
for,
i
would
be...
i
would
be
in
total
agreement
with
your
honor.
but
the
postal
service
had
filed
for
300,
at
least
350,
i
believe,
copyrights,
books,
training
manuals,
things
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
protection
for
the
legitimacy
of...
of
stamps.
so
again,
the
postal
office
has
defined
itself
through
its
actions
as
a
person
in
comparable
commercial
tort
situations.
it's
only
logical
that
if
a
postal
service
in
the
commercial
world,
saying
that
it's
not
like
the
united
states
for
copyrights,
for
trademarks,
then
it's
not
like
united
states
with
respect
to
antitrust.
when
congress
formed
the
postal
service,
your
honors,
and
it
took
away
the
apa,
the
postal
rate
commission
for
these
non-monopoly
actions,
as
well
as
the
federal
acquisition
regulations,
certainly
there
was
a
quid
pro
quo.
if
you
streamline
the
operations
of
the
postal
service,
launch
it
into
business,
you
would
expect
the
private
commercial
torts
in
antitrust
laws
to
be
the
restraint
to
make
sure
that
the
monopoly
is
not
extended
to
the
other
kind
of
operations.
and
so
i
think
that
congress'
intent
is
quite
clear
that
the
postal
service
is
unique,
does
not
partake
of
the
united
states,
and
therefore,
just
as
the
postal
service
can
be
sued
in
tort
law
and
under
the
lanham
act,
be
it
the
old
lanham
act,
the
new
lanham
act,
it
can
be
sued
under
the
antitrust
laws
as
well.
the
burden,
therefore,
on
the
solicitor
general
to
explain
why
congress
would
have
wanted
the
postal
service's
monopoly
to
be
extended,
and
why
congress
would
have
wanted
the
postal
service
to
be
sue...
to
be
able
to
be
sued
and
to
sue
themselves
without
really
being
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
opportunity
to
sue
in
their
own
name
under
the
antitrust
laws
or
under
trademark
and
copyright
law,
et
cetera,
and
why
they
shouldn't
be
sued
as
well.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
