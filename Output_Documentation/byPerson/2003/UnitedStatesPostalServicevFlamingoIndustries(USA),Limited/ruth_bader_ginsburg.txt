justice

bader

mr.
kneedler...
mr.
kneedler,
but
i
don't
think
in
that
case
there
was...
the
question
was
raised
whether
the
alaska
railroad
was
an
agent
of
the
united
states
that
would...
would
carry
the
immunity
of
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
think
it
was
a
contested
issue
in...
in
that
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kneedler,
where
does
the
money
come
to
pay
the
judgment?
justice
ginsburg
is
it...
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
isn't
the
general
judgment
fund?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
the
united
states
sue...
bring
an
antitrust
suit
as
plaintiff
on
behalf
of
the
postal
service?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't
the
court
say
in
cooper,
the
reason
why
we're
not
letting
the
united
states
be
a
person
as
plaintiff,
because
if
we
did
that
it
would
follow
like
the
night
day
that
they
would
be
a
person
as
a
defendant,
and
we
certainly
don't
want
them
to
be
a
person
as
a
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
right
in
the
opinion.
it's
not
something
subtle.
one
of
the
driving
forces
for
saying
they
couldn't
be...
they
weren't
going
to
read
into
the
act
plaintiff
status
was
that
this
court
thought
that
would
mean
they
would
be
a
person
for
defendant
status.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
krent,
can
we
go
back
to
sea-land,
where
i
thought
that
the
first
point
made
in
that
decision
was
indeed
as
a
result
of
the
change
in
the
apa
that
alaska
railroad
could
be
sued
for
injunctive
relief.
the
court
said,
yeah,
they
could
be
sued
like
any
person,
not
for
damages,
but
for
injunctive
relief.
and
then
it
said,
but
this
is
the
question
of
whether
congress
authorized
them
to
be
a
defendant
in
an
antitrust
case
is
a
totally
discrete
question,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i'm...
from
the
court's
point
of
view,
it...
the
court
made
as
a
threshold
determination
that
the
railroad
could
be
sued
for
equitable
relief,
so
it
could
be
sued.
and
then
it
says,
but
that
doesn't
answer
the
question,
we
have
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
claim,
any
claim
under
the
antitrust
laws,
and
on
that
the
court
relied
on
cooper.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
the
lanham
act,
definition
written
right
into
the
lanham
act
was
that
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
that
act
is
an
organization
capable
of
suing
and
being
sued.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
said
it
with
respect
to
the
antitrust
law
in
cooper,
but
the
lanham
act
defined
person
differently.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i...
i
thought
that
was
what
was
critical,
that
any
organization
capable
of
suing
and
being
sued
was
within
the
lanham
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
there
a
good
reason
for
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
stop
people
from
engaging
in
designed
piracy
in
stamps?
