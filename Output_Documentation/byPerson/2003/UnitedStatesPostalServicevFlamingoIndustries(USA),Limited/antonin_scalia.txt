justice
antonin
scalia
is
the
postal
service
subject
to
the
administrative
procedure
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
say
it
carried
forward
the...
the
essential
governmental
character.
what...
what
does
that
consist
of?
doesn't
it
consist
of
the
nature
of
the
entity,
not
just...
just
the...
the
tag?
it
can't
just
put
a
tag
on
it
and...
and
say
it
has
an
essentially
governmental
character.
i
thought
that
the...
that
the
purpose
of
the
reorganization
was
to
make
the
postal
service
function
like
a
regular
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'll...
i'll
qualify
it.
a
regular
business,
a
regular
public
utility...
justice
antonin
scalia
which
has...
which
has
certain
obligations,
yes.
they
have
to
do
universal...
universal
mail
service,
just
as
a
telephone
company
has
to
give
universal
telephone
service.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
rest
of
their
operations
were
supposed
to
be
business-like.
justice
antonin
scalia
insulated
from
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're...
you're
saying
on
the
one
hand
it's
part
of
the
government,
but
on
the
other
hand,
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
insulate
it
from
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they...
are
they
removable
by
the
president?
justice
scalia
for
cause.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
like
the
heads
of
independent
agencies.
justice
antonin
scalia
congress
never
said
that
they
were
supposed
to
operate
like
a
business,
which
was
the
purpose
of
the
reorganization
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
did...
it
did
retain
that
monopoly
and...
and
the
government's
position
here
is
that
the
postal
service
has
the
power
to
extend
that
monopoly
into
fields
that
the
government
did
not
specifically
confer
upon
it,
right?
because
the
government's
position,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
only
that
the
postal
service
can't
be
sued
under
the
antitrust
laws,
but
that
the...
that
the
postal
service
is
not
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
can...
it
can
go
ahead
and
extend
the
monopoly
conferred
by
statute
beyond
the...
the
narrow
context
granted
by
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
happens...
i'm
sorry,
go
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
get
into
a
car
accident
with
a...
with
a
postal
delivery
truck,
do
i
sue
the
united
states
under
the
federal
tort
claims?
justice
antonin
scalia
don't...
before
we
get
off
of
eminent
domain,
don't...
don't
a
lot
of
state
public
utility
entities
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
really
doesn't
determine
what...
justice
antonin
scalia
and
they're
subject
to
the
sherman
act,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
this
only
becomes
a
real
problem
when
the
postal
service
turns
a
profit
on
its
monopoly
business,
which
it
has
not
yet
succeeded
in
doing,
has
it?
justice
scalia
how
is
he
selected?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
the
board
of
governors?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you...
you...
you
concede
that
before
the
postal
reorganization
act,
the
answer
to
the
question
would
be
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you...
you
have
to...
i
mean,
you're...
you're
not
writing
on
a
blank
slate.
you...
you
have
to
find
enough
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
to
change
that
answer
from
no
to
yes,
and
that's
really
the
burden.
justice
antonin
scalia
given
that
the
postal
service
was
not
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
before,
something
so
fundamental
happened
in
1970
that
it
is
now
a
person
under
the
antitrust
law.
that's...
that's
your...
justice
scalia
your
burden.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
its
employees,
are
its
employees
subject
to
the
taft-hartley
law,
or...
or...
or
are
they
like...
like
federal
workers?
justice
antonin
scalia
so...
so...
would...
would
their
employees
be
members
of
the
american
federation
of
governmental
employees
or
other
unions?
justice
antonin
scalia
postal
workers
union?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
of
course,
the
reorganization
act
itself
specified
that
they'd
be
subject
to
taft-hartley,
did
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
didn't
it
specify
that
they
would
be
subject
to
the
sherman
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i...
i
don't
think
that
helps
you,
i
think
it
hurts
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
it...
it
is
a
significant
feature
that...
that
the...
their
employees
are
subject
to
taft-hartley,
but
that...
that
is
more
than
answered
by
the
fact
that
it
says
so
in
the
reorganization
act.
why
doesn't
it
say
so
about
the...
about
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
there...
there
wouldn't
be
a
remedying
as
the
postal
service,
but
i
assume
you
could
sue
american
greetings
and
hallmark
and
whoever
else
had
conspired
with
the
postal
service.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
unilateral
action,
they'd
be...
justice
scalia
that's...
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
curious
thing
about
this
suit.
it
actually
represents
a
portion
of
the
monopoly
business,
of
using
the
monopoly
to...
to
monopolize
procurement.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
really
sell
biking
gear?
they
don't
sell
biking
gear.
do
they
sell
biking
gear?
