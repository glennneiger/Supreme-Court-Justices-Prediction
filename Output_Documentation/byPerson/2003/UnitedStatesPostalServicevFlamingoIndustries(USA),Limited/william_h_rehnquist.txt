chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
02-1290,
the
united
states
postal
service
v.
flamingo
industries.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
private
express
statute
still
in
effect?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
post
office
have
the
power
of
eminent
domain?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about...
what
about
inverse
condemnation?
supposing
the
post
office
takes
property
without
the
ability
to
pay
for
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if...
what
if
the
post
office
buys
a
lot
of
paper
from
somebody
and
doesn't
pay
for
it?
what's...
what
is
the
remedy
of
that
person
on
a
contract?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
could
be...
that
sort
of
an
action
could
be
brought
under
the
contract
disputes
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
krent,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
then
that
the
cooper
decision
doesn't
affect
your
argument,
because
the...
the
congress
has
separated
the
post
office
department
from
the...
from
the
executive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
neither
of
those
are
quite
in
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
isn't
any
postmaster
general
anymore,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
differentiate
though
from
the
meyer
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
meyer
says
you
have
to
have
something
more
than
a
sue-and-be-sued
clause,
that
you
have
to
show
that
there's
a
cause
of
action
available.
so
a
sue-and-be-sued
clause
itself
is
not
enough
for
you
in
this
case,
don't
you
agree
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
yes,
but
the...
that
was
true...
they
said
that
in
the
cooper
case
too,
that
person,
and
the
cooper
court
said,
no,
the
united
states
is
not
a
person.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
certainly
after
the
cooper
decision,
it
was
clear
that
the
united
states
could
not
be
a
defendant
either,
was
it
not,
as
well
as
not
be
a
plaintiff...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
answer
my
question,
will
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the...
what,
the
postal
reorganization
act
was
1970?
have
any
other
antitrust
suits
been
brought
against
the
postal
service
in
that
34
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
no
longer
the
position
of
the
department,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
congress
could
have
said
the
postal
service
is
authorized
to
sue
and
omitted
the
be-sued
clause.
it
could
have
done
it
that
way...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
which
there
would
have
been
no
waiver.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
say
launch
into
the
commercial
marketplace,
they're
basically
selling
stamps
and
nobody
else
is
selling
stamps.
what
kind
of
a
launching
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
whatever
they
are...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
i
thought
conceded
they
were
subject
to
federal
tort
claims
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it's
a
state
court
action
against
the
post
office?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the...
the
post
office
can
be
sued
in
state
court
then
for
a...
for
a
state
tort?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's...
that
what
i
thought
i
asked
you
a
minute
ago...
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
said
something
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
krent.
mr.
kneedler,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
02-1290,
united
states
postal
service
versus
flamingo
industries
will
be
announced
by
justice
kennedy.
