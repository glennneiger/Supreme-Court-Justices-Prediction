suppose
there...
suppose
there
were
an
actionable
violation
of
the
antitrust
laws
and
there
was
a
conspiracy
between
two
private
suppliers,
and
the
postal
service,
through
some
of
its
high
officers,
joined
that
conspiracy.
would
there
be
any
liability,
individual
liability,
on
the
part
of
the
officers
of
the
postal
service?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
this
sue-and-be-sued
clause,
is
it
your
position
that
there
must
always
be
a
federal
statute
authorizing
the
suit
before
the
post
office
has
any
substantive
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
does
have
some
substantive
force
in
some
other
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
case
that
requires
us
to
consider
whether
the
united
sates
postal
service
is
subject
to
liability
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
and
in
this
case,
the
postal
service
is
the
petitionary
in
this
court
and
flamingo
industries,
which
is
a
corporation,
is
the
respondent.
at
one
time
flamingo
had
been
making
mail
sacks
for
the
postal
service.
its
contract
was
terminated
at
which
point
the
flamingo
sued
the
postal
service
alleging
various
violations.
the
relevant
one
here
is
the
allegation
that
there
was
a
violation
of
the
federal
antitrust
laws,
specifically
the
sherman
act.
in
the
united
states
district
court,
the
court
dismissed
the
antitrustâ€™s
claims
but
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed.
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
postal
service
is
subject
to
antitrust
liability
on
certain
conditions.
we
granted
certiorari
and
we
now
hold
the
postal
service
is
not
subject
to
antitrust
liability,
so
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
the
postal
service
was
created
by
an
act
that
we
refer
to
as
pra.
that
is
the
postal
reorganization
act
of
1971.
the
pra
makes
the
postal
service
an
independent
establishment
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
that
is
the
statutory
phrase
an
independent
establishment
of
the
executive
branch
of
the
government
of
the
united
sates.
in
an
earlier
decision
in
this
court,
which
is
entitled
meyer
versus
fdic,
we
said
there
is
a
two-step
inquiry
in
cases
like
this:
the
first
is
whether
there
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
against
an
agency
of
the
government.
if
there
is,
we
ask
the
second
question
which
is
whether
the
substantive
prohibitions
of
the
act
in
question
do
in
fact
apply
to
an
agency
of
the
government.
as
to
the
first
step,
the
pra
does
provide
that
the
postal
service
can
sue
and
be
sued
in
its
official
name.
so,
there
is
a
waiver
of
immunity
that
makes
the
postal
service
generally
amenable
to
suit.
still,
there
is
no
liability
if
the
substantive
law
in
question
is
not
intended
to
reach
the
federal
entity
so,
we
must
proceed
to
that
second
step.
our
examination
of
the
sherman
act
and
our
decisions
interpreting
it
lead
us
to
hold
that
the
postal
service
is
not
subject
to
antitrust
liability.
the
sherman
act
applies
to
persons
--
that
is
the
phrase
used
in
the
act
--
but
the
postal
service
is
not
a
person
separate
and
apart
from
the
united
states.
its
designation
as
an
independent
establishment
of
the
executive
branch
is
not
consistent
with
the
idea
that
it
is
an
entity
existing
outside
the
government.
absent
an
expressed
statement
from
the
congress
that
the
postal
service
can
be
sued
for
antitrust
violations
despite
its
governmental
status,
the
postal
service
is
not
subject
to
antitrust
liability,
our
conclusion
is
consistent
with
the
nationwide
public
responsibilities
of
the
postal
service
which
has
different
goals,
obligations,
and
powers
form
private
corporations,
and
nor
thus
the
fact
that
the
postal
service
has
lines
of
business
beyond
the
scope
of
its
mail
monopoly
show
it
is
separate
from
the
government
under
the
antitrust
laws.
the
postal
service,
in
both
form
and
function,
is
not
a
separate
person
from
the
united
states.
it
is
part
of
the
government
and
does
not
control
by
antitrust
laws.
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed
and
our
opinion
is
unanimous.
