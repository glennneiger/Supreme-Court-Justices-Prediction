there's
a
lot
of...
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
kneedler...
justice
david
h.
souter
would
there
be
an...
some
alternative
remedy
to
the
antitrust
law
if
the
postal
service
decided
to
use
its
profits
from
the
monopoly
business
in
effect
to
subsidize
predatory
rates
in
the
package
delivery
business
in
order
to
put
ups
out
of
business?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
they
go
along
with
it.
they
say,
okay,
we
are
going
to
eliminate
ups.
would
there
be
any
alternative
claim...
source
of
remedy
by
ups
to
the
antitrust
laws?
justice
souter
what
would
be
the...
justice
david
h.
souter
what
would
be
the
substantive
basis
for
the
review?
justice
david
h.
souter
and...
and
would
it
eliminate
this
possibility
of
predatory
lowing...
lowering
rates
for...
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even...
even
when
it
is,
i
take
it
the
object
of
the
money
that
it
makes
is
essentially
to
break
even,
maybe
break
even
and
a
little
bit
more,
on...
on
the
mail
delivery
operation,
which
the
statute
itself
recites
as
being
a
sovereign
responsibility
of
the
united
states.
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
i
mean,
that's...
that's
a
long
way
from
general
motors.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
is
to
make
money,
but
it
is
to
make
money
in
order
to
subsidize
a
particular
activity,
and
i
don't
think...
maybe
i'm
missing
something...
but
i
don't
think
there's
an
indication
that
there's
a
mandate
there
to
maximize
profits
to
in...
in
effect
subsidize
the
rest
of
the
government.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
monopoly
business
is
described
in
the
statute
as
being
the
discharge
of
a
sovereign
obligation
of
the
united
states,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is...
what
is
the...
what
is
the
organizational
form
of
this
business?
it's
not
a
corporation,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
it's
not
a
separate
corporation.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it...
is
it
a
partnership?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
structure,
i
take
it,
is
unlike
anything
that
one
would
find
in...
in
a...
in
a
private
profit-making
organization.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
a
corporation,
not
a
partnership.
