justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
krent...
but
when
it
goes
into
all
those
fields
anyway...
we've
made
this
point
about
15
times...
it...
it
doesn't
set
the
prices
it
wants.
it
sets
prices
controlled
by
a
commission
under
a
mandate
that
says
it's
supposed
to
break
even.
justice
breyer
isn't
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
no...
in
greeting
cards
and
so
forth?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
is
it...
it...
and
it's
free?
in
other
words,
it
doesn't...
it
isn't...
well,
you...
i
thought
you
answered
justice
souter
by
saying
that
they
do
have
an
obligation
even
there
to
break
even
overall?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
in...
in
the
greeting
card
business,
they
decided
to
go
into
an
agreement
with
three
other
companies,
hallmark
and
smith's
greeting
cards,
and
they
were
to
fix
their
prices
at
$14
a
greeting
card,
which
seems
about
right
nowadays...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the...
then
under
those
circumstances,
there
would
be
no
remedy...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
the
consumer
of
the
stores.
there's
no
government
agency
anybody
could
appeal
to?
justice
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that's...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
eleven
people
running
this,
nine
of
whom
were
appointed
by
the
president
of
the
united
states,
i
take
it
that's
your...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
that
the
directors
are
appointed
by
the
president
of
united
states,
almost
all
of
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
nine
out
of
the
eleven
are
appointed.
are
they
confirmed
by
congress?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
so...
and
they're
represented
by
the
solicitor
general,
and
their
license
plates
have
government
on
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but,
i
mean,
and...
and
they
say
that
they're
part
of
the
government,
and
80
or
90
percent
of
what
they
do
is
not
what
private
industry
does
at
all
and
you
have
remedies
against
all
of
it
except...
under
other
statutes
or
powers
of
review
within
the
government,
except
for
a
small
portion,
i
take
it
it
is
a
small
portion,
this
greeting
card
business.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then,
so
you're...
in
other
words,
i
thought
you
were
selling
them
sacks,
you
wanted
to
sell
them
burlap
sacks.
justice
breyer
they're
some
kind
of
sack.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
aren't
they
used
for
mail?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so...
and
they
make
treaties,
by
the
way,
too.
i
don't
know
that
general
motors
now
can
make
a
treaty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so...
so
it
wouldn't
help
you
if
we
said
that
in
the
vast
bulk
of
their
business
where
they
have
all
of
these
characteristics
i
just
mentioned...
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
it...
it
would
help
you?
justice
breyer
how?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
selling
the
sacks
for
the
greeting
cards
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
don't?
justice
breyer
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
don't
you
go
to
the
commissions
that
run
them
and
tell
them
they
can't
do
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
might
deliver
some
mail
on
bicycles,
i
mean...
