mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case
that
the
united
states
postal
service
may
be
sued
for
treble
damages
under
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
the
court
of
appeals
fundamentally
erred
in
this
holding.
throughout
the
nation's
history,
postal
operations
have
been
carried
out
by
the
united
states
government
itself,
pursuant
to
the
express
authorization
in
article
i
of
the
constitution,
for
congress
to
establish
post
offices
and
post
roads.
as
this
court
explained
in
the
council
of
greenburgh
case
about
20
years
ago,
the
furnishing
of
postal
services
has
historically
been
regarded
as
a
sovereign
function,
indeed
a
sovereign
necessity,
to
promote
intercourse
among
the
states
and
bind
the
nation
together.
such
functions
of
the
united
states
government
are
not
regulated
by
the
antitrust
laws.
indeed,
more
than
60
years
ago,
in
the
cooper
corporation
case,
this
court
held
that
the
united
states
is
not
a
person
for
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
although
the
precise
question
before
the
court
in
that
case
was
whether
the
united
states
could
sue
as
a
plaintiff
under
section
7
of
the
sherman
act,
the
court
noted
that
the
same
word,
person,
is
used
to
describe
who
may
be
held
liable
as
a
defendant,
either
in
a
civil
action
or
in
a
criminal
prosecution.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
i
think
that
there
are
no
instrumentalities
that
are
constituent
parts
of
the
united
states
government
itself
that
could...
that
could
be
held
liable.
the
word
instrumentality
is
used
in
a...
in
a
somewhat
vague
sense,
elastic
sense,
and
i
think
it
would
be
necessary
to
look
at
the
particular
statute
to
see
how
much
of
a
governmental
character
a
particular
entity
has.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it...
it...
it
did,
but
the...
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
on
that.
first
of
all,
after
the...
the
court
of...
after
the...
this
court's
cooper
decision,
a
number
of
lower
court
decisions
have
held,
beginning
with
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision
in
the
sea-land
case
involving
the
alaska
railroad,
that
agencies
of
the
united
states
or
instrumentalities
just
like
the
united
states
itself
is
not
a
person
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
the
ninth
circuit
didn't...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the...
the...
it
was...
the
court
regarded
it
as
an...
as
an
instrumentality,
and
in
fact
the...
the
court
there
recognized
that
the
railroad
and
the
officials
of
the
government
responsible
for
supervising
the
railroad
could
be
sued
under
the
apa,
and
that,
therefore,
there
had
been
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
to
that
extent,
and
to
the
extent
of
allowing
injunctive
relief.
so
the...
the
court
certainly
focused
on
the
question
that
the
alaska
railroad
and
those
responsible
for
managing
it
were
part
of
the
united
states
government.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
may
not
have
been
contested,
but
it...
but
it...
the
court
certainly
addressed
that
question
and
then
went
on
to
hold
that
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states,
the...
the
railroad
was
not
subject
to
suit
under
the
antitrust
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
not.
it...
it...
congress
specifically
accepted
it
that
there's...
in
section
410
of
the
act,
there's
a
very
detailed
enumeration
of
the
provisions
that
congress
did
want
and
did
not
want
to
be...
the
postal
service
to
be
subject
to.
but
the...
the
important
point
for
present
purposes
is
that
in
1970,
when
congress
enacted
the
postal
reorganization
act,
it
carried
forward
the
essential
governmental
character
of
the
postal
service,
just
as
it
had
been
up
until
that
point.
in
fact,
section
101(a)
of
the
act
says
that
the
united
states...
and
i
quote...
the
united
states
postal
service
shall
be
operated
as
a
basic
and
fundamental
service
provided
to
the
people
by
the
government
of
the
united
states.
and
then
it
says,
the
postal
service
shall
have
as
its
basic
function
the
obligation
to
provide
postal
services
to
bind
the
nation
together.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in...
in
a...
in
a
limited
sense.
congress...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i...
i...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the...
in
the
description
of...
of
how
the
postal
service
was
to
be
operated
carrying
forward,
the...
the
congress
repeatedly
referred
to
the
postal
service
as...
as
a
governmental
function,
a
public
service
to
be
operated
in
a
business-like
way.
but
what
congress
meant
by
that
was
to
insulate
the
postal
service
from
the
prior
political
interference
that
had
come
up
by
imposing
the
duty
on
congress
to
repeatedly
raise
rates
and...
and
address
services.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not...
but
by...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
by...
by
no
means
insulate
it
from
the
government.
the
postal
service...
the
governors
of
the
postal
service
are
denominated
officers
of
the
united
states,
so
the
people
responsible
for
the
postal
service
are
officers
of
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they're
removable
for
cause.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
but...
but
certainly
the
other
independent
agencies
like
the
federal
trade
commission
and
agencies
like
that
are
part
of
the
united
states
government
performing
a
governmental
function.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
actually,
in
the...
in
the
text
of
the
act
itself,
there...
there
is...
there
is
not
an
express
directive
that
the
postal
service
will
be
operated
like
a
commercial
entity.
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
to...
was
to
rationalize
the
internal
operations
of
the
postal
service,
but
it
did
not
change
any
of
the
fundamental
ways
in
which
the
postal
service
operated.
it...
it
maintained
the
postal
monopoly,
which,
under
the
private
express
statutes,
about
80
percent
of
the
revenues
of
the
postal
service
are...
are
protected
by
the
private
express...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
not
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
not
a...
that
is
not
a
new
feature
of
the...
of
the
postal
service.
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
quoting
this
court's
decision
in
the
emergency
fleet
corporation
case,
there
the
court
pointed
out,
with
respect
to
the
post
office,
it
said
the
post
office
has
since
1872
competed
with
bankers
through
money
orders,
it
competed
with
savings
and
loan
association
through
savings
accounts,
which
the
postal
service
operated...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
the
postal
service
itself
would
not
be...
would
not
be
liable,
and
i...
and
i
think
if
the...
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
one
means
by
a...
by
a
conspiracy
as
well,
because
if
the...
the
postal
service
has
brought
authority
in
procurement,
for
example,
to...
it's
exempt
from
some
of
the
federal
procurement
statutes,
but
congress
granted
it
the
authority
to
have
its
own
procurement
arrangements.
so
if
the...
if...
if
a...
if
the
postmaster
general
decides
on
a
particular
procurement
methodology
that...
that
was
alleged
to
be
anti-competitive,
i
don't
think
that
could
be
fairly
characterized
as
a
conspiracy,
even...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is,
it
is,
and
that
has...
that
has
not
been
changed,
and
the
court
discussed
that
in
the
california
board
of
regents
case
and
other...
and
other
decisions
of
this
court.
really,
the...
all
the
ninth
circuit
relied
upon
in...
in
this
case
was
the
presence
of
a
sue-and-be-sued
clause
in
the
postal
reorganization
act,
which
simply
says
that
the
postal
service
may
sue
and
be
sued
in
its
official
name.
there
is
a...
there
is
virtually
no
discussion
of
that
provision
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
and
the
ninth
circuit
essentially
said
that
because
the
postal
service
may
sue...
may
be
sued
in
its
official
name,
therefore,
it
has...
its
sovereign
character
has
been
cast
off
and
it
can
be
sued
just
like
a
private
party.
that...
that
analysis
is
in
direct
conflict
with
this
court's
decision
in
fdic
v.
meyer,
where
the
court
reversed
a
similar
determination
with
respect
to
the
fdic,
saying
that
the
ninth
circuit
had
conflated
what
are
two
analytically
distinct
questions.
the
first
is
whether
there
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity.
we
do
not
dispute
that
there
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
here
under
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause.
but
the...
the
second
and
critical
question
here
is
whether
the...
the
substantive
law
that
the
plaintiff
relies
upon
provides
an
avenue
for
relief.
in
this
case,
that
is
the
antitrust
laws,
and
congress
has
never
amended
the
antitrust
laws
to
make
an
agency
or
an
entity
of
the
united
states
government
liable.
after
the
decision
in
cooper...
cooper
corporation,
congress
amended
the
clayton
act
to
allow
the
united
states
to
sue
as
a
plaintiff
if
it's
injured
in
its
business
or
property,
but
it
did
not
do
that
by
changing
the
word
person.
it...
it
explicitly
provided
a
cause
of
action
for
the
united
states
as
the
united
states,
but
it
did
not,
as
the
d.c.
circuit
pointed
out
in
the
sea-land
case,
amend
the
definition
of
person
or
otherwise
make
the
united
states
or
its
constituent
parts
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws
as
a...
as
a
defendant.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
part
of
the
reorganization.
there
was
a
post
office
department
before
that
was
part
of
the
cabinet,
and
what...
what
congress
wanted
to
do
was
to
take
the
post...
postal
operations
out
of
the
cabinet
and
put
them
under...
under
the
board
of
governors,
who
are
officers
of
the
united
states
but
not
part
of
the
cabinet.
and
the...
the
phrase,
establishment
of
the
executive
branch,
is
used
with
respect
to
other
undeniably
federal
agencies,
as
we
point
out
in
our...
in
our
brief,
the
opm,
office
of
personnel
management,
the
transportation
safety
board.
and
i...
i
think
it's
just
intended
to
make
clearer
that
the
postal
service
was
not
to
be
under
the
president's
direct
control,
and
in
fact
there
were
proposals
to
make
the
postal
service
a
corporation,
and
congress
emphatically
rejected
that.
and
instead,
as
president
nixon
proposed
in...
in
submitting
a
proposal
to
congress,
the
postal
service
would
be
constituted
as
an
agency
like
the
sec
or
nasa
or
the
board
of
governors
of
the
federal
reserve
system.
all
of
those
entities
are...
are
performing
quintessentially
governmental
functions
that
are
not
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
yes,
you
do.
and...
and...
it's...
it's
an
important
thing
to...
to
be
clear
about
in
the
postal
reorganization
act.
pervasively
throughout
that
statute,
congress
treated
the
postal
service
as
a
governmental
entity.
the
torts
are
subject
to
the
federal
tort
claims
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
out
of
the...
out
of
the
postal
service
fund,
but
that
is
a
fund
in
the
treasury.
there's
a
separate
provision...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no...
no,
it's...
no,
it's
not,
but...
but
there
are
other...
other
situations
in
which
appropriated
funds
from
a
particular
agency
are
used
to
reimburse
the
judgment
fund
if
there's
a
particular
appropriation
set
aside
for
that
purpose,
so
this
is
not
a
unique
feature
of...
of
the...
of
the
postal
act.
but
if
i
could
also
mention,
torts
are
subject
to
suit
against
the
united
states,
but
with
respect
to
contracts,
congress
subjected
the
postal
service
to
the
contract
disputes
act.
the
court
of
claims
held
almost
20
years
ago,
soon
after
the
act
was
passed,
that
the
united
states
itself
could
be
sued
under
the
tucker
act
based
on
a
breach
of
contract
with
the
postal
service,
because
of
the
close
connection
between
the
postal
service
and
the
united
states.
the
postal
service
could
be
sued
in
district
court
in
its
own
name
under
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause
for
breach
of
contract,
but
the
court
of
claims
held
that...
that
the
united
states
itself
can
be
sued,
and
therefore
is
responsible
for
the
contracts
of...
of
the
postal
service,
and
it...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we...
we
believe
it
could.
it
would...
it
would
be
brought
in
its
own
name,
but...
but
the
united
states...
if
the
postal
service,
just
like
any
other
entity,
purchased
goods,
for
example,
and
was
a
victim
of...
of
a...
of
a...
of
an
antitrust
violation,
the
united
states
would
be
able
to
sue
and...
and
collect
treble
damages.
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
cooper
corporation
case,
where
there
was
a
procurement
of
tires
by
a
number
of
different
federal
agencies,
and
congress
authorized
the
united
states
to
bring
a
suit
to
recover
for
the
injuries
sustained
to
federal
agencies
generally
in
that
situation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
a
general
rule,
yes.
there...
before
the
federal
tort
claims
act
was
passed,
it
was
assumed
that
tort
claims
could
be
brought
against
federal
entities
that
had
sue-and-be-sued
clauses,
although
a
lot
of
those
were
private
corporations
that
were
instrumentalities,
not...
not
federal
agencies.
and
also
with
respect...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's...
it's
been...
it's
unclear
because
back
when
they
were
first
put
in
the...
in
the
statutes,
the...
the
separation
of
a...
the
existence
of
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
and
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
were...
were
not
separated
the
way
they
are
today.
for
example,
under
the...
under
the
tucker
act,
a
plaintiff
can
bring
a
breach
of
contract
action
against
the
united
states,
even
though
there's
no
statute
that
specifically
provides
a
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
contract.
it's
thought
that...
that
the
reference
to
contracts
in
the
tucker
act
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
that,
and
we...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
does,
it
does,
and
it
has...
it...
it
carries
forward
the
power
to
investigate
postal
offenses,
to...
to...
with
appropriate
authorization,
to
search
the
mails.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
know
that
the
question
has
arisen,
but
i...
i
would
assume
that
a...
a
suit
could
be
brought
against
the
united
states
under
the
tucker
act
on
the
same
theory
that
i
mentioned
with
respect
to
a
breach
of
contract
by
the
postal
service.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they...
they
do,
and
that...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i...
i
think
it's
part
of
an
overall
pattern.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
but
it's
part
of
an
overall
pattern.
congress
does
not
lightly
confer
the
right
of
eminent
domain
on...
on
federal
agencies,
but
it's
part
of
a
general
pattern
in
which
the
united
states...
excuse
me,
in
which
congress
treated
the
postal
service
as
a...
as
a
governmental
entity.
i
did
want
to
point
out
one
particular
way
that
illustrates
the...
the
way
in
which
the
antitrust
laws
are
unsuitable
here.
the
precise...
this
is...
this
is
at
bottom
a
routine...
a
routine
procurement
dispute.
and
as
the
ninth
circuit
held
in
this
case,
the
plaintiffs
here
had
a
cause
of
action,
in
fact,
brought
one
under
the
administrative
disputes
resolution
act
that
is
essentially
a
bid
protest
statute.
and
there
are
two
features
of
that
statute
that
are
inconsistent
with
antitrust
liability
in
this
setting.
first
of
all,
congress
expressly
provided
that
the
standard
of
review
in
such
an
action
is
the
arbitrary
and
capricious
standard
of
the
apa,
meaning
that
the
postal
service,
like
any
other
federal
agency
subject
to
that,
has
to
have
broad
latitude...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
except...
except
to
this
extent.
in...
in
virtually
every
direction
you
turn,
and
looking
on
how...
on
how
disputes
involving
the
postal
service
are
handled,
you
find
a
governmental
dispute
resolution
mechanism,
and
that...
this
was
the
point
about
the...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there's...
there's
express
authorization
for
suing
the
united
states
for...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
same...
same
thing.
where
congress
has
wanted
to
provide
the
united...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there...
there
might
be...
there
might
be
remedies
under
some
of
the
statutes
mentioned
here.
there...
i
mean,
congress
has
expressly
subjected
the
united
states
to
suit
under
the
lanham
act,
under
the
copyright
statute,
under...
under
the
trademark
laws,
under
the
patent
laws,
but...
and...
and
then
there
are
these
procurement
statutes
that
i
mentioned
that
are
applicable
in
this
particular
case.
but
in
this
case
as
well,
congress
did
not
provide
for
treble
damages.
the
only
monetary
relief
a
plaintiff
could
get
in
this
procurement
situation,
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief
under
the
administrative
dispute
resolution
act,
is
bid
preparation
costs,
not
treble
damages.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
would
be
an
alternative
remedies.
before
the
contract
disputes
act
was
passed,
the
postal
service
could
have
been
sued
itself
in
its
own
name
under
the
sue-and-be-sued
clause,
or
in
the
tuck...
under
the
tucker
act
in
the...
in
the
court
of
claims.
now
under
the
contract
disputes
act,
congress
has
made
that
statute
applicable
to
the
postal
service
just
as
it
has
to
other
federal
entities.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
and
there
is
specifically
a
postal
service
board
of
contract
appeals,
just
there...
as
there
is
a
board
of
contract
appeals
in...
in
other
agencies.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
way...
the
way
congress
addressed
that
was
to
subject
the
postal
service
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
postal
rate
commission,
and
all...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
would...
i
would...
if
the...
a
decision...
it's
a
complicated
mechanism
the
way
the
postal
rate
commission
interacts
with
the
postal
service,
but
there
is
a
provision
for
judicial
review.
if
the
postal
service
enters
a
final
decision
after...
after
receiving
the
input
from
the
postal
rate
commission,
there
is
a
provision
for
judicial
review
of
that...
of
determinations
of...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
rates
and
classifications.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
under...
under
the
postal
reorganization
act,
the
provisions
beginning
in...
in
section
3601
of
the
act
address
rate-making
and
classification,
and
there
are
specific
standards
there
that
the
postal
rate
commission
and
the
postal
service
must
adhere
to.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they...
they
are
designed
to.
the...
the...
the
way
the...
the
way
the
act
operates,
it
specifies
that
each
classification...
first...
two
things:
one,
overall,
the
postal
service
rates
are
to
be
set
at
a
rate
so
that
they...
the
income
will
roughly
equal
expenditures
and
then
within
each
class,
congress
has
provided
the
direct
and
indirect
costs
of
that
class
are
to
be
allocated
to
it,
along
with
some...
an
appropriate
portion
of
the
institutional
costs,
the
things
that
are
difficult
to...
to
allocate
to
any
one...
any
one
class.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
and...
and
it's
not...
over
the
long
term,
over
the
long
term
since
the
postal
reorganization
act,
i
believe
that
the
postal
service
is
within
about
a
billion
dollars
of
breaking
even.
there
are
times
when
it
is
in
a
deficit.
there
are
times
when
it
is
in
a
surplus,
but
the
statutory
goal
is
that
it...
that
it
be
roughly
equal
balance
between...
between
income
and
expenditures.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
that's
true
for
letters,
but
not
for
parcel
post.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
there's...
there's
an...
the
postal
service
adopted
an
exception
to
the
private
express
statutes
for
urgent
letters,
which...
which
has
allowed
organizations
like
federal
express
to
carry
letters
for
urgent
delivery.
absent
that
exception,
they
would...
that
practice
would
be
prohibited
by
the...
by
the
private
express
statutes.
but
the...
the
idea
that
the
postal
service
competes
with
non-federal
entities
is
not
new.
as
i...
as
i
pointed
out,
the
postal
service
began
competing
with
money
orders
before
the
turn
of
the
last
century,
for
50
years
have
had
savings
deposits
with
up
to
4
million
depositors
that
competed
with
savings
associations,
so
and...
and
it's
competed...
it
went
into
the
parcel
post
business,
the
parcel
delivery
business
in
1913
alongside
other
businesses.
so
that...
that
sort
of
competition
with
private
businesses
has...
has
occurred
since
well
before
the
postal
reorganization
act,
and
nothing
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
changes
the
way
in
which
that
should
be
regarded
under
the...
under
the
antitrust
laws.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
several
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
addition
to
the
other
statutes
that
i've
mentioned
with
respect
to
the
right
to
sue,
there
are
a
number
of
other
respects
in
which
congress
has
treated
the
postal
service
as
a
federal
entity.
it's
subject
to
their
freedom
of
information
act,
the
privacy
act,
the
inspector
general
act,
it's
subject
to
the
federal
sector
osha
regulations,
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
loeffler
decision,
it's
subject
to
the
federal
sector
title
vii
prohibitions,
not...
it's
not
treated
as
a
private
corporation
for
purposes
of
title
vii.
it
is
subject
to
the
national
labor
relations
act,
but
this
act
was
passed
in
1970
before
the
federal
sector
labor...
labor
management
provisions
came
in
in
the
civil
service
reform
act,
and
as
you
pointed
out,
justice
scalia,
that's
an
express
provision
subjecting
the
postal
service
to
something
that
otherwise
applies
to
private
entities,
but
in...
but
in
virtually
every
other
respect,
congress
has
specified
that
it
would
be
subject
to
federal
law.
and
in
section
409
of
the
act,
with
respect
to
judicial
proceedings,
congress
specified
that
the
postal
service
would
be...
would
be
treated
just
like
the
united
states,
not
just
with
respect
to
tort
claims
act,
but
venue,
removal
jurisdiction,
and
representation
by
the
attorney
general.
but
the...
the
most
fundamental
point,
however,
to
be
made
is
that
this
is
not
a
situation
in
which
congress
has
created
a
new
entity
and
launched,
in
that
sense,
that
entity
into
a
private
commercial
world.
here,
congress
has
carried
forward
the
nation's
tradition
of
treating
postal
services
as
sovereign
functions
performed
by
the
government
of
the
united
states.
these
are...
these
are...
to
the
extent
they're
commercial
functions
and...
and
they
are
unusual
commercial
functions,
the
constitution
treats
them
as...
as
something
of
particular
interest
to
the
united
states
government.
i
should
point
out
that
with
respect
to
the
postal
services,
all
postal
services
are
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
postal
rate
commission,
not
just
those
that
are
subject
to
monopoly,
that...
that
the
postal
service
has
monopoly
control
over,
justice
breyer.
so
even
in
those
areas
in
which
the
postal
service
is
subject
to
competition
in...
in
parcel
and
express
mail,
for
example,
the
postal
service...
the
postal
rate
commission...
does
have
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
those...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
does
not
over
greeting
cards,
but
the
non-postal
functions
of
the
postal
service
constitute
less
than
1
percent
of
the
revenues
of
the...
of
the
postal
service.
we're
talking
about
a
very
minor
aspect
of
the
postal
service's
operations,
and
the
affirmative
authorization
for
the
postal
service
to
engage
in
that
in
section
404(7)
of
the
act
is
cast
in
the
same
terms
as
the
postal
service's
authorization
to
engage
in
all
the
other
functions
and
they're
really
incidental.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think...
i
think
it
shows
that...
that...
that
the
predominant
character
of
the
postal
service
is
as
it
always
has
been,
and
these...
these
other
services
are
really
in
most
ways
incidental
to...
to
postal
services
like
greeting
cards
and...
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
this...
this
is...
this
is
not...
this
is
not
that.
this
case
is
a...
is
an
ordinary
procurement
dispute
that...
all
federal
agencies
engage
in
procurement
and...
and...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
in
procurement,
and
in
procurement
in
particular,
congress
has
treated
the
postal
service
like
all
other...
all
other
federal
agencies
under
the
contract
disputes
act,
particularly
with
respect
to
the
disputes
at
issue
here.
so
in
the
end
we
believe
that,
as
justice
o'connor
said,
this
is
essentially
a
policy
choice
for
congress.
if...
if
in
the
current
climate
the
postal
service
is
to
be
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
it
remains
a
governmental
entity,
that
is
a...
that
is
a
choice
that
congress
should
make,
whether
these
governmental
activities
should
be
regulated
by
treble
damage
actions,
which
was
extremely
unusual
under...
under
federal
statutes.
and
where
congress
has
chosen
to
subject
the
united
states
to
liability
under
statutes
such
as
this,
but
not
nearly
as
free-ranging
in
the
patent
laws,
et
cetera,
it
has
done
so
expressly,
and
we
think
30
years
after
the
passage
of
the
postal
reorganization
act,
that
if
the...
if
the
postal
service
is
now
to
be
subject
to
the
antitrust
laws,
that
is
something
for
congress
to
do
and
not
for
the
courts
to
try
to
divine
from
complete
silence
in
the
postal
reorganization
act
or
its
legislative
history
on
that
point.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i...
i'm
not
sure
whether
they...
i...
i
don't
know
whether
they
sell
biking
gear.
the
fact
that
they...
the
fact
that
they
use
the
postal
service
team
in...
in...
in
promoting
postal
service
products,
i
think,
doesn't
say
anything
about
whether
they're
subject...
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
entirely
possible.
