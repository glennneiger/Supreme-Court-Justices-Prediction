mr.
kneedler,
in
your
view,
are
there
any
instrumentalities
of
the
united
states
that
you
think
could
be
considered
a
person
under
the
sherman
act?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course,
i
guess
the
court
whose
judgment
we're
reviewing
thought
that
the
change
in
the
structure
of
the
postal
service
affected
the
nature
of
that
instrumentality.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
an...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
this
the
kind
of
policy
judgment
that
we
ought
to
leave
to
congress
to
make
explicitly?
the
post
office,
as
reorganized,
has
two
aspects
to
it,
as
you've
pointed
out
effectively,
but
how
it
should
relate
to
the
antitrust
act
seems
to
be
the
kind
of
judgment
that
congress
should
address
expressly.
isn't
that
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
we
had
already
discussed
that.
i
mean,
the
mere
fact
that
there's
a
sue-and-be-sued
clause
is
not
enough
under
the
meyer
approach
to
answer
the
question.
you
have
to...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
take
another
step...
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
beyond
that.
