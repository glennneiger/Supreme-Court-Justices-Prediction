you
would
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
his--
--whoever
said
that?
whoever
said
that?
yes.
[laughter]
send
them
back
to
school.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
dictionary
was
that?
let
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pressman,
every
act,
every...
even
a
negligent
act
has
some
willful
action
connected
with
it.
you
will
to
leave
the
snow
on
your
sidewalk
which
somebody
slips
and
falls
on,
but
we
don't
call
that
doing
willful
injury
to
someone.
it
seems
to
me
we
call
it
willful
only
when
the
intentional
act
is
not
one
that
leads
to
the
injury,
but
the
intentional
act
is
the
injuring.
that's
what
i've
always
thought
willful
injury
meant,
not
that
there's
some
willful
act
along
the
line.
there
always
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
didn't
have
to
intend
to
hurt
mr.
colwell.
he
had
to
intend
to
do
the
injury,
and
he
did
intend
to
do
the
injury,
which
was
criminal
conversation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
take
tinker
to
mean
only
you
don't
have
to
hate
the
person.
you
don't
have
to
have
some
personal
desire,
maliciousness
towards
the
individual,
but
that's
quite
separate
from
whether
you
intended
to
produce
the
harm,
the
very
harm
that
you
produced,
and
it
seems
to
me
in
tinker
the
person
did.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
knew
that
he
was
sleeping
with
some
other
man's
wife.
did
he
not
know
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
action
of
his
was
malicious
there,
the
dropping
of
the
gun,
or
the
carrying
of
the
gun?
i
agree
with
you,
the
carrying
of
the
gun,
intentionally
violating
the
law
is
malicious.
justice
antonin
scalia
explain
to
me
how
consumers
would
not
be
hurt
by
your
position.
most
consumer
debt
is
probably
credit
card
debt.
let's
assume
a
consumer
who
has
a
lot
of
credit
card
debt
seeks
a
discharge
in
bankruptcy
and
the
credit
card
company
comes
in
and
says,
at
a
time
when
you
knew
you
were
insolvent
you
sought
additional
credit.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
willful...
willful
act
and
therefore
all
of
your
charges,
once
you
knew
you
couldn't
pay
them,
are
not
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy.
wouldn't
that
be
the
consequence?
i
think
it
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
a
lot
of
cases,
and
you
think
that
all
credit
card
charges
run
up
after
the
person
is
insolvent
are
not
dischargeable
in
bankruptcy?
justice
antonin
scalia
--unless
the
crime
was
fornication
and
not
adultery.
i
thought
it
was
an
adultery
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
correct,
only
if
you're
defaming
a
public
figure.
