mr.
norman
w.
pressman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
section
523
of
the
bankruptcy
code
excepts
willful
and
malicious
injuries
from
discharge
and
the
bankruptcy
court's
finding
here
that
paul
geiger
intentionally
administered
substandard
care
and
that
his
action
shocked
even
a
person
lacking
formal
medical
training
met
this
court's
standards
set
out
in
tinker
v.
colwell
because
his
actions
constituted
a
willful
disregard
of
his
duty.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
the
distinction
here,
your
honor,
is
that
dr.
geiger
knew
the
standard
of
care.
he
was
asked
and
the
record
shows
that
he
knew
the
proper
standard
of
care
was
the
administration
of
intravenous
penicillin
and
he
said,
notwithstanding
that,
i
gave
mrs.
kawaauhau
oral
tetracycline.
the
distinction
here
is
the
intentional
administration
of
something--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--the
distinction
here,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
slip
of
the
scalpel.
if
dr.
geiger
had
reached
into
his
bag
and
pulled
out
the
wrong
medicine,
or
if
he
had
botched
a
complicated
medical
procedure,
we
wouldn't
have
a
case.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
in
that...
i
would
agree
with
that...
that--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--description,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--that
if
somebody
intentionally
says,
i'm
going
to
put
my
car
in
reverse
and
i'm
going
to
drive
back
and
i
don't
care
who's
there,
i
think
that
is
intentional.
i
believe
an
example
which
shows
our
point
is--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--well,
my
response
to
that,
your
honor,
would
be
twofold.
first,
i
think
if
we
go
back
to
the
tinker
case--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--well,
your
honor,
i
would
compare
what
happened
here...
and
let
me
start
by
saying,
i
think
what's
hard
initially
to
understand
about
this
case
is
that
people
assume
that
a
physician
would
always
act
according
to
his
duty
and
would
never
intentionally
disregard
it.
i
think
a
better
example
here,
an
example
which
illustrates
our
point,
was
one
used
the
other
day
which
we
considered,
the
builder
who
uses
substandard
steel.
he
doesn't...
building
collapses,
it
violates
a
code
provision.
he
doesn't
intend
to
kill
anyone.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
no.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
no.
we
concede
that
dr.
geiger
did
not
intend
to
hurt
mrs.
kawaauhau,
but
our
position,
justice
o'connor,
is
that...
and
dr.
geiger
testified
numerous
times,
he
admitted
it,
that
he
knew
that
intravenous
tetra...
intravenous
penicillin
was
the
correct
standard
of
care
and--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--your
honor,
let
me
address
that
point.
in
tinker,
when
justice
peckham
wrote
for
the
court,
he
recognized
and
he...
recognized
that
the
willful
and
malicious
test
had
two
prongs,
willful
and
malicious.
when
analyzing
whether
mr.
colwell...
mr.
tinker's
action
was
willful,
he
said
the
action
is
willful,
not
that
the
injury
was
willful.
he
referred
to
the
action
and
he
said
it
was
willful
in
the
view...
in
the
idea
that
it
was
intentional
and
deliberate.
dr.
geiger's
actions
here
were
intentional.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
peter
halford,
the
expert
defin...
deposition,
the
expert
who
testified
both
in
hawaii
and
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
testified
to
that
fact.
he
stated
that
the
intentional
administration
of
substandard
care
led
to
the
worsening
of
her
condition
and
the
eventual
amputation
of
her
leg.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
and
i
think
the
point
of
your
question
and
justice
ginsburg's
question
is,
does
the
term
willful
apply
to
the
injury
or
does
it
apply
to
the
act--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--and
our
point
is--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--your
honor,
the
definition
of
injury
is
twofold.
the
word
injury
can
mean
either
the
damage,
the
cut
on
my
hand,
the
result
of
an
action,
or
it
can
mean
the
action
which
causes
the
harm.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
in
the
phrase,
for
instance,
his
injury
to
the
painting,
it
is
the
act
and
i
believe--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--your
honor,
let
me
cite
the
definition
from
the
merriam
webster
dictionary.
injury
an
act
or
the
result
of
inflicting
something
that
causes
loss
or
pain.
we
cannot
forgive
his
injury
of
the
painting,
or,
his
falsehood
gave
great
injury
to
his
brother's
reputation.
we're
saying
that
the
word
injury
is
the
act,
not
the
damage,
and
i
believe
that's
the
definition
which--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--that
is
the
merriam
webster
dictionary
and
a
similar
dictionary...
a
similar
definition,
your
honor,
appears
in
the
oxford
second
edition.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
and
i
believe
if
i
were
starting
with
a
clean
slate
in
this
case
and
i
didn't
have
the
definition
that
we
had
in
tinker,
i
think
i'd
have
to...
i
do
have
to
fight
that
battle.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
i
believe
that
in
order
to
rule
in
our
favor,
one
has
to
look
at
the
term
willful
as
meaning
the
same
thing
that
this
court
held,
that
willful
means
voluntary.
dr.
geiger
in
this
case
was
asked
and
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
his
action
was
intentional.
therefore,
we
meet
the
standard,
the
standard
this
court
set
out.
i
don't
believe
i've
answered
your
question,
though.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
and
your
honor,
in
1946
the
eighth
circuit
in
harrison
v.
walker
held
that
drunk
driving
was
a
willful
and
malicious
injury.
it
was
only
until
after
the
enactment
of
the
bankruptcy
code
in
1978
that
there
was
some
uncertainty
as
to
whether
that
was
still
the
law.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
our
position,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
congress
reenacted
the
identical
language
in
the
bankruptcy
code
of
1978
and
therefore
the
same
interpretations
apply.
if
you
look
to
the
legislative
history,
which
my
colleague
relies
on,
it
doesn't
say
that
tinker
is
overruled.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
criminal
conversation,
your
honor.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
it
was...
nothing
that
i've
seen
in
either
the
state
court
or
the
supreme
court,
this
court's
opinion
indicates
that
mr.
tinker
even
knew
who
mr.
colwell's
wife
was.
it
was
an
act
which
was
intentional
in
that
he--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--your
honor,
if
willful
modifies
injury,
i
don't
think
we
have
a
very
good
position,
but
in
tinker,
your
honor,
mr.
tinker
wasn't
intending
to
hurt
mr.
colwell.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
i
would
have
to
disagree
with
you,
justice
scalia.
i
don't--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--i
don't
see
any
evidence
in
the
tinker
opinion
that
mr.
tinker
intended
to
harm
anybody.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
in
the
opinions
that
i
have
read,
that
fact
is
not
apparent.
it
appears
that
he
slept
with
someone
who
was
not
his
wife.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
and
justice
o'connor,
you're
correct,
they
did
not
change
the
language
of
the
statute
and
this
court
has
noted
that
reenacting
the
same
language
would
be
a
strange
way
to
change
a
statute.
but
even
if
we
get
to
the
legislative
history--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--i've
won
that
argument?
[laughter]
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
redundancy
of
the
words,
i
believe
it's
difficult
to
come
up
with
an
action
which
is
malicious
but
not
willful.
i
think
it's
easy
to
come
up
with
an
action
that
is
willful
and
not
malicious.
an
example
of
the
second
action
would
be
if
someone
came
in
here
to
harm
one
of
the
justices
and
marshall
bosley
shot
him.
his
action
would
be
willful
but
not
malicious.
he
wasn't
disregarding
his
duty.
on...
an
example
of
something
which
is
malicious
but
not
willful
might
be
someone
who
came
from
a
state
where
carrying
a
firearm
was
perfectly
okay,
but
he
knew
in
the
city
of
washington,
d.c.
that
carrying
one
was
illegal.
he
carries
it
through
the
airport,
makes
it
here,
it
drops
out
of
his
pocket,
the
bullet
hits
someone.
his
action
there
i
think
is
arguably
not
willful
but
it's
malicious.
he
had
a
duty.
he
disregarded
his
duty.
i
think
that's
an
example
of
something
where
you
use
both
of
the
words
willful
and
malicious.
if
the
words
willful
and
malicious
both
modify
injury,
then
i
think
they
are
redundant,
because--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--it
was
not
the
dropping
of
the
gun,
because
that
was
an
accident.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
it
was
the
carrying
of
the
gun--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--yes.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
without
just
excuse--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--or
a
willful
disregard,
or
a
dis--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--i
would
agree
with
that.
if
the
word
willful
modifies
injury,
then
i
don't
have
a
very
good
case.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
your
honor,
in
tinker,
this
court
says
an
act
is
willful
in
that...
in
the...
in
that
the
act
is
intentional
or
voluntary,
not
that
the
injury
is
intentional
or
voluntary.
that's
what
this
court
i
believe
said
in
tinker.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
justice
kennedy,
that
is
the
way
i
interpreted
it
and
that
is
the
way
i
read
tinker.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
your
honor,
i'd
also
point
out
that
in
this
case
the
standard
that
this
court
set
in
tinker
has
been
a
standard
which
has
not...
which
has
been
well
used
until
the
1978
amendments.
the
matter
came
up
before
the
courts
in
the
mcintyre
case
and
it
came
up
before
the
case
in
aetna.
in
mcintyre
the
court
found
itself
with
a
case
of
someone
who
converted
some
collateral,
even
though
there
was
no
default
on
the
loan.
there
was
no
problem
with
the
court
finding
that
action
was
intentional
and
malicious.
the
amicus
in
this
case
on
my
opponent's
side
has
suggested
that
they're
concerned
about
consumers
being
injured
by
my
position
and
i
think
that
answer
is
taken
care
of
by
the
aetna
case,
where
there
were
some
inadvertent...
there
was
some
inadvertent
conversion
of
collateral.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
there
was
no
malpractice
insurance,
and--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--i
don't
believe
it
does.
some
states
do
require
it.
missouri
does
not
require
it
and
i
don't
believe
that
illinois
requires
it.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
justice
scalia--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--in
that
case,
yes,
but
i
think
the
amicus
point
is
that--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--it's
a
matter
of
what
the
facts
are
before
the
judge.
in
that
situation,
i
think
it
would
be.
the
point
i
think
the
amicus
made
was
that
in
credit
card
debt
in
this
country,
if
i
buy
a
refrigerator
at
sears,
i
give
a
lien
on
my
refrigerator
to
sears
and
the
concern
is
that
people
will
buy
a
refrigerator
and
maybe
give
it
to
their
aunt,
or
sell
it
and
2
years
later
file
and
then
find
themselves
being
charged
with
committing
a
willful
and
malicious
conversion,
as
the
act
used
to
mention,
and
in
the
davis
case,
someone
who
converted
collateral
in
accordance
with
an
ordinary
practice,
a
custom
that
was
agreed
upon
with
the
lender,
was
found
not
to
have
acted
willfully
and
maliciously.
in
the
example
given
by
the
amicus,
i'd
say
if
someone
bought
25
refrigerators
from
sears
and
then
filed
bankruptcy
3
days
later,
or
a
month
later,
i
think
that
would
be
willful
and
malicious,
at
least
if
i
were
the
judge
hearing
that
evidence.
mr.
chief
justice,
this
court
has
long
held
that
the
discharge
is
for
the
honest
and
unfortunate
consumer
debtor,
and
i
think
the
evidence
in
the
record
below
here
shows
that
dr.
geiger
is
none
of
the
above.
justice
murphy
in
her
dissent
below
said
that
those
words
could
be
better
applied
to
the
kawaauhaus,
people,
honest
consumers
who
had
the
unfortun...
the
misfortune
to
land
in
dr.
geiger's
office.
i'd
ask
to
reserve
my
time
if
there's
no
further
questions.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
any
questions
i
will--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--kawaauhau.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
mr.
kaw...
i've
had
trouble
pronouncing
it.
that's...
my
understanding
is
that
that's
how
to
pronounce
it.
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
kawaauhau.
maybe
it's
kawaauhau.
i--
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
--i
may
be
using
the
st.
louis
pronunciation.
[laughter]
mr.
norman
w.
pressman
thank
you,
your
honor.
