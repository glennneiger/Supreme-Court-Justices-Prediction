justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
interpret
the
statute
as
saying,
for
a
willful
act
which
results
in
malicious
injury--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
some
instances
in
which
reckless
conduct
is
so
reckless
that
you
can
apply
the
definition
of
willful
and
malicious
to
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
case
where
the
man
throws
the
firecracker
into
the
gasoline
laden
basement
and
the
explosion
injures
the
fellow
worker,
that's...
is...
how
does
that
come
out,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
implication
of--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
implication
of
malice
was
that
there
was
a
wrongful
act
done
without
any
justification
or
excuse.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
it
was
intentionally
done
and
so
that
implied
the
necessary
malice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no.
it
was
the
kind
of
act
which
was
done
without
excuse
and
therefore
the
court
implied
malice.
that's
the
way
i
read
the
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
was
mr.
justice
peckham's
case,
not
mine.
