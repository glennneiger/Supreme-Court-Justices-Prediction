justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--said
candidly
that
you
are
not
contending
that
he
meant
to
hurt...
that
the
doctor
meant
to
hurt
this
woman
and
yet
you
say
that
the
tinker
case
is
helpful
to
you,
and
that
i
don't
understand,
so...
i
thought
tinker
was
a
clear
case
of
intending
what
in
those
days
was
a
very
grave
offense
against
a
man's
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
one
asks,
what
injuries
did
you
suffer,
well,
i
broke
my
collarbone,
i
dislocated
my
hip,
that's
what
one
thinks
of
as
the
injuries.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
it
would
work
without
the
special
provision
for,
i
knew
i
got
into
that
car
when
i
imbibed
much
too
much
and
i
happened
to
kill
or
maim
someone.
so
i
knew
what
was
intentional
was,
i
got
drunk.
what
was
not...
but
you're
transferring
that...
that's
the
act.
i
put
myself
in
that
shape
so
that
i
couldn't
drive
carefully.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
now
we
have
a
specific
provision
doing
that
and,
if
malpractice
should
work
the
same
way,
one
would
expect
a
similarly
specific
provision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
run
up
against
that
terrible
problem
that
tinker
was
a
deliberate
trespass
on
another
man's
property.
those
were
the
facts.
this
was
criminal
con...
what
do
they
call
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
about
a
few
of
the
facts
here,
it
is
extraordinary
that
a
doctor
would
have
no
malpractice
insurance,
but
that
was
the
case
here,
was
it
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
doesn't
hawaii
state
law
require
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
as
you
see
the
case,
then,
malpractice
actions
in
general
as
a
category
would
not
come
under
(a)(6).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
regard
defamation
actions
for
(a)(6)
purposes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
what
the
practice
is
in
the
states
with
respect
to
requiring,
as
a
condition
of
retaining
a
medical
license,
malpractice
insurance?
