ms.
laura
k.
grandy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
eighth
circuit
held
that
the
debt
owed
by
dr.
geiger
to
the
petitioner
was
dischargeable
because
he
had
no
intent
to
harm
the
petitioner.
that
has
been
admitted
this
morning.
the
eighth
circuit
opinion
is
supported
by
the
plain
meaning
of
section
523(a)(6),
the
legislative
history
of
section
523(a)(6),
the
purposes
and
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
and
the
tinker
case
itself.
the
plain
meaning
of
section
523(a)(6)
focuses
on
the
language,
willful
and
malicious
injury.
willful
and
malicious
both
modify
injury.
you
need
both
a
willful
injury
and
you
need
a
malicious
injury
to
comply
with
section
523(a)(6).
willful
was
defined
in
tinker
as
meaning
intentional
and
voluntary.
in
the
legislative
history
the
congress
said
willful
means
intentional
and
deliberate.
it
wasn't
a
whole
lot
different
than
the
tinker
definition.
malice
has
been
defined--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--no,
your
honor.
reckless
conduct
is
not
intentional
conduct
and
the
statute,
the
congressional
history
as
well
as
tinker
looked
to
intentional
conduct.
tinker
in
particular,
the
examples
they
gave,
justice
peckham
gave
an
example
of,
if
i
negligently
drive
my
car
into
a
busy
thoroughfare,
injuring
someone,
that
would
not
be
an
intentional
injury
because
i
didn't
intend
to
injure
anyone,
as
opposed
to
if
i
intentionally
went
into
that
thoroughfare
to
injure
someone.
that
would
be
intentional--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--your
honor,
you're
referring
to
the
hartley
case,
i
believe,
which--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--was
also
decided
by
the
eighth
circuit,
and
what
the
eighth
circuit
said
there
was,
the
intent
was
to
cause
an
injury.
the
injury
was
to
startle
and
scare
the
employee
in
that
case,
as
opposed
to
the
injury
which
went
further
and
actually
injured
the...
caused
physical
harm
to
him
and
the
court
in
that
case
said,
when
you
have
an
intent
to
injure
someone,
be
it
startling
or
scaring
them,
we're
not
going
to
say
the
injury
was
only
meant
this
far,
not
this
far.
in
this
case
before
you,
we
have
no
intent
to
injure
at
all.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
he
said
driving
into
a
crowded
thoroughfare.
i
was
assuming
he
was
driving
a
cart
or
buggy,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
i
didn't
think
he
was
driving
a
car.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
i
had
to
think
about
that,
too.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
what
malicious
adds
is
almost
an
escape
clause.
you
can
have
an
intentional
injury
that's
not
necessarily
malicious.
for
instance,
the
banks
of
the
mississippi
river
are
swelling
and
i
know
if
i
cut
a
hole
in
the
levee
i
may
flood
out
farmer
a,
but
i'm
going
to
save
the
village
down
the
river
and
that's
why
i'm
cutting
a
hole
in
the
levee.
i
don't
intend
necessarily
to
injure
farmer
a,
although
my
actions
will
and
i
know
they
will
injure
farmer
a,
but
my
just
cause
or
excuse,
which
comes
out
of
the
malicious
definition,
is
that
i'm
trying
to
save
the
village
down
below,
or
in
the
example
given
earlier,
where
the
deputy
or
the
marshal
stops
someone
from
injuring
you,
he
intends
to
injure
that
person,
but
his
excuse
is,
he's
trying
to
save
the
justices.
so
that's
what
malicious
adds.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
in
that
case,
your
honor,
the
injury
went
to
the
marital
right
itself.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
that's
what
the
court
determined.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
your
honor,
i
don't
think
the
legislative
history
necessarily
overruled
tinker.
i...
the
legislative
history
said
that
to
the
extent
that
other
cases
have
relied
on
tinker
to
hold
a
reckless
disregard
standard,
they
are
overruled.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
within
tinker
itself,
one
of
the
real,
or
one
of
the
main
substances
that
have
come
out
of
tinker
is
the
implied
malice
standard
and
i
think
that's
what
the
court
was
referring
to
there.
in
an
act
such
as
that,
it's
implied,
whether
you
knew
her
husband
or
not,
you
were
damaging
his
marital
rights.
you
didn't
have
to
know
him.
it
was
implied
the
minute
that
type
of
act
was
done,
and
there
are--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--because
in
this
case,
your
honor,
there's
no
showing
of
any
intent
at
all,
which
is
admitted
by
the
other
side,
to
cause
any
injury.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
the
intent
not
to
have
malpractices
insurance
isn't
an
intent
to
cause
an
injury.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
no,
it
isn't,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
i
believe
in
tinker--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--if
we
go
with
your
facts,
your
honor,
if
in
tinker
the
husband
did
not
know
she
was
married
at
all,
i
would
agree,
but--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--yes.
yes,
that
mr....
yes,
that
he
did
not
believe
that
she
was
married,
then
i
think
that
fact
cannot
be
true.
i
don't
think
those
are
the
facts
in
tinker.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
there's
no
showing
that
he
didn't
know,
but
i
think
the
conclusions
that
are
set
forth
by
the
court
in
that
case
imply
that
he
did
know.
the
court
says
this
is
one
of
the
grossest--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--i'm
sorry--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--if
he
didn't
know?
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
i--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--yes,
your
honor.
in
tinker,
in
order
to
prove
criminal
conversation
you
had
to
prove
that
there
was
a
marriage
and
that
the
act
was
performed,
and
those
two--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--in--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--i
don't
know,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
the
case
doesn't
tell
us,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
no.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
examples
that
are
given
throughout
tinker
refer
to
intentional
conduct.
if
you
look
at
the
examples
given
by
justice
bailey--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--they--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--my...
your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
implied
intent
actually
grew
from
the
examples
they
gave
of
other
intentional
conduct
in
that
case--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--not
necessarily
from
tinker.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
well,
it
was
as--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--if
he
were
intentionally
doing
a
wrongful
act,
he
would
have
had
to
have
known
it
was
wrong
to
sleep
with
mr.
tinker...
mrs.
colwell,
then--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--your
honor,
because
he
knew
she
was
married.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
right,
your
honor.
i
was
just
bringing
up
the
language--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--it
is
a
difficult
case
to
read
and
i
think--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
yes.
at
the
time
that
dr.
geiger
made
the
choice
to
do
the
various
procedures
that
he
did
throughout
this,
his
intent
was
never
to
injure,
nor
was
his
choice
governed
by
any
intent
to
injure.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
that's--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
no,
your
honor,
not
unless
there
was
some
intent
on
the
part
of
a
doctor
to
injure
and
i
don't
believe
you
find
that
in
malpractice
cases.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
you
would
have
to
have
an
intent
to
defame
the
person.
if--
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
--i
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
okay.
there
are
exceptions.
[laughter]
your
honor,
the
eighth
circuit
looked
for
its
definition
of
intent
to
the
restatement
and,
in
doing
that,
it
determined
that
an
intentional
act
is
one
where
the
actor
desires
or
believes
that
the
results
are
going
to
occur
and,
looking
at
that
definition,
the
court
determined
that
dr.
geiger
did
not
intend
to
harm
the
patient,
therefore
he
had
no
willful
desire,
or
therefore
there
was
no
willful
injury.
having
reached
that
point,
the
eighth
circuit
concluded
that
section
523(a)(6)
did
not
apply
and
therefore
the
debt
was
dischargeable.
ms.
laura
k.
grandy
no,
i
don't,
your
honor,
but
as
a
policy
reason,
if
the
state
was
concerned
that
this
court's
ruling
would
have
some
effect
to
cause
doctors
to
not
carry
malpractice
insurance,
they
could
govern
that
by
licensing
it
within
their
own
states
and
requiring
insurance,
just
as
in...
most
states
are
now
requiring,
or
several
states
are
requiring
insurance
in
order
to
have
a
driver's
license.
dr.
geiger,
as
found
by
the
bankruptcy
court,
had
several
reasons
for
his
treatment.
he
in
prescribing
various
types
of
medicine
at
all
times
1)
believed
his
patient
was
getting
better,
2)
thought
he
was...
she
had
the
ability
to
absorb
medicine
very
well
through
her
stomach,
which
is
why
he
made
the
various
choices
he
made,
thought
her
infection
had
burned
out,
and
thought
she
had
developed
a
superinfection
in
determining
to
stop
using
antibiotics
altogether.
so
even
if
you
were
to
take
the
definition
of
malice
as
set
forth
in
the
tinker
case,
dr.
geiger
would
have
just
cause
or
excuse
for
having
done
what
he
did.
the
legislative
history
also
supports
this
by
looking
at
the
language
to
the
extent
other
cases
have
relied
on
tinker
to
hold
a
reckless
disregard
standard.
there,
the
courts
once
again
are
focus...
or
congress
is
focusing
on
the
intent
of
the
injury
itself,
because
a
reckless
act
would
be
one
that
would
not
require
intent.
within
the
section
500
of
the
restatement
is
the
definition
of
recklessness
and
within
that
subsection
(f)
of
that
definition
there's
a
comparison
of
intentional
misconduct
to
recklessness
and,
when
you
compare
the
two,
recklessness
does
not
require
an
intent.
that's
why
we
feel
reckless
conduct,
which
the
eighth
circuit
said
at
the
very
worst
his
conduct
was
reckless,
it
would
be
dischargeable
because
there's...
you
don't
have
the
element
of
intent
in
a
reckless
type
of
act.
tinker
we...
i
do
not
believe
is
in
conflict
with
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit,
because
most
of
the
examples
in
tinker
appear
to
require
an
intent
to
injure.
the
implied
malice
standard
is
limited
to
certain
facts
in
certain
situations
and
tinker
certainly
does
not
support
a
reckless
disregard
standard,
so
the
legislative
history
is
not
overruling
tinker
but
basically
saying,
read
tinker
correctly.
the
purposes
and
policy
of
the
bankruptcy
code
will
be
furthered
by
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit.
this
is
because
the
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
code
overall
is
to
provide
a
debtor
with
a
fresh
start
and
that
is
why
exceptions
to
discharge
are
narrowly
reviewed.
the...
requiring
an
intent
to
cause
an
injury
would
lead
to
such
a
narrow
interpretation
and
enhance
the
fresh
starts.
intentional
act,
if
you
only
require
that
which
results
in
injury,
would
lead
to
virtually
everything
being
nondischargeable,
as
pointed
out
by
the
eighth
circuit.
if
you
speed
up
to
a
yellow
light
because
you're
in
a
hurry
to
pick
someone
up,
that
would
be
an
intentional
act.
it
would
be
nondischargeable.
if
you're
driving
too
fast
for
conditions,
even
though
you're
driving
within
the
speed
limit,
that
would
be
an
intentional
act
which
would
be
nondischargeable.
buying
something
on
credit
because
you
think
you
can
pay
for
it,
but
intentionally
buying
it
and
then
ultimately
losing
your
job
and
not
being
able
to
pay
for
it
would
be
an
intentional
act
and
be
nondischargeable
under
that
theory.
once
again,
justice
peckham's
example
of
driving
into
a
crowded
thoroughfare
would
be
an
intentional
act
under
that
definition.
we
feel
the
policies
and
the
purpose
of
the
bankruptcy
code
are
furthered
by
this
court
deeming
that
the
decision
of
the
eighth
circuit
was
correct
and
affirming
that
decision.
