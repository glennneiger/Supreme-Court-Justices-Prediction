justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
question
about
this
famous
tinker
case
for
you?
do
you
agree...
and
i'm
inclined
to
think
he's
right...
with
your
opponent
that
the
opinion
there
did
not
rely
at
all
on
the
notion
that
the
defendant
or
the
bankrupt
tried
to
injure
the
husband
of
the
woman
he
seduced?
it
was
merely
the
question
of
whether
she'd
given
consent
and
that
was
not
enough
to
void--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
right,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--my
question
is
whether,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
defendant,
or
the
seducer,
whichever
party
it
was,
it's
clear
from
the
record
that
there's...
the
court
did
not
rely
at
all
on
the
notion
that
he
was
trying
to
injure
the
husband
of
the
woman
he
seduced?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
basically
are
you
saying
tinker
is
an
unusual
fact
situation
and
it
was
un...
overruled
by
legislative
history,
or
we
should
overrule
it
now?
what
is
your
position
about
tinker?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
couldn't
we
by
analogy
say
here
there's
implied...
an
implied
intent
just
as
much
as
was
implied
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
showing
that
he
did
know
in
tinker.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
surely
doesn't
say
so.
it
surely
doesn't
say
so.
well,
could
it
have--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it
doesn't.
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
read
the
opinion,
he
might
not
have
known
anything
about
the
marital
status
of
the
woman
that
he
seduced.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
they
implied
the
intent
because
the
facts
were
so
outrageous
to
the
judges
at
the
time
and
i
don't
know...
you
know,
the
same
kind
of
reasoning
might
justify...
i'm
not
saying
it
would,
but
the
conclusion
of,
well,
this
doctor
was
sufficiently
outrageous
in
his
failure
to
be
careful
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
that
you'd
take
the
same
reasoning
the
court
used
in
tinker,
that
you
imply
the
intent.
that's
what
they
did.
they
implied
the
intent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
inferred
it,
i
guess
is
the
proper
way
to
say
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
mean
to
be...
i'm
just
curious.
how
do
you
pronounce
your
client's
name?
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
i
thought
in
hawaiian
every
vowel
was
supposed
to
be
pronounced.
