justice

h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
97
115,
margaret
kawaauhau
v.
paul
geiger.
mr.
pressman,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
pressman,
when
you
say
that
there
was
a
finding
that
he
intentionally
administered
substandard
care,
is
that
any
different
than
a
finding
that
the...
that
his
standard,
the
standard
of
care
which
he
recognized
was
negligent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
you,
because
you
could
say
that
about
any
number
of
things
where
you
talk
about
medical
malpractice.
the
standard
was
to
perform
surgery,
but
a...
in
a
hypothesis,
but
this
particular
doctor
prescribed
medicine
instead.
he
intentionally
prescribed
medicine
and,
therefore,
his
action
was
not
merely
negligent
but
intentional.
i
think
that
just
blurs
the
entire
dist...
difference
between
negligence
and
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
can
you
say
that
an
injury
was
willful
if
you're
not
referring
to
the
act
by
which
it
was
caused?
i
mean,
injuries
don't
have
intentions
of
their
own.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
can
an
injury
mean
the
action
which
causes
the
harm?
i've
never
heard
of
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
else
would
willful
modify
besides
injury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
pressman.
ms.
grandy,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
ms.
grandy,
did
i
understand
you
to
say
that
justice
peckham
in
1903
was
talking
about
driving
a
car
into
a
busy
intersection
and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
adulterer...
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
that
an
element
of
the
crime
of
defama...
or
the
action
of
defamation
itself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean...
or
can
you
negligently
defame
someone?
i
don't
know.
i
thought
you
had
to
say
something
defamatory
knowing
of
its
falsity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
grandy.
mr.
pressman,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i'm
sure
you
know
better
than
we
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
thank
you,
mr.
pressman.
the
case
is
submitted.
