day
o'connor
well,
what
if
you
have
a
driver
who
intentionally
puts
his
car
in
reverse
and
doesn't
look
back
to
see
what's
behind
him
and
drives
over
somebody.
i
mean,
under
your
theory,
then
that's
inten...
it's
willful
and
no
bankruptcy
provision
applicable.
indeed,
first
degree
murder.
yeah,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
know,
i
just
find
it
hard
to
believe
that
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind
in
writing
this
provision
for
exclusion
under
the
bankruptcy
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
find
tinker
a
little
hard
to
understand
myself.
i
mean,
maybe
we
can
confine
it
to
what
it
is,
but
i
think
that's
a
weak
read.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
there's
anything
in
this
record
that
indicates
that
the
doctor
intended
that
the
petitioner
lose
her
leg--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--or
suffer
some
serious
health
loss?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
maybe
we'd
better
clarify
tinker
and
do
it
soon
if
that's
your
reading
of
it.
i
think
the
language
used
is
somewhat
careless,
but
it
did
say
in
tinker
the
act
is
willful
in
the
sense
that
it
is
intentional
and
voluntary
and
we
think
it
is
also
malicious.
i
don't
know
what
the
court
meant
by
that,
but
perhaps
some
clarification
of
that
language
is
in
order.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
willful
means
intending
to
injure,
what's
left
for
malicious?
what
does
that
add?
