justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
the
problem
i
think
that
at
least
you
have
is,
this
is
not
your...
the
tort
in
your
case
is
not
an
intentional
tort
on
the
restatement's
definition
of
intentional
torts,
i
take
it,
and
if
that
is
so...
if
that
is
so,
and
i...
it
seems
so,
then
either
the
word
willful
means
to
pick
up
intentional
torts,
in
which
case
you'd
lose,
or
somehow
willful
extends
beyond
intentional
torts
in
the
way
you
suggest,
in
which
case
you
might
win.
but
if
you're
right,
it
seems
to
create
an
irrational
distinction
among
negligence
torts.
sometimes
what
is
really
the
same
thing,
negligence,
would
not
be
dischargeable.
sometimes
what
is
really
the
same
thing,
negligence,
would
be
dischargeable,
and
that
irrational
distinction,
though
sometimes
it
would
benefit
your
clients
and
sometimes
hurt
them,
you
see,
doesn't
seem
one
that
the
statute
would
like...
be
intended
to
make.
now,
i
put
that
to
you
because
i'd
like
to
hear
your
response,
since
i
think
it's
important.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that--
--well--
--you'd
have
a
good
case
if
that
were
so.
i...
no,
please.
you--
--i
have
some
language
here
in
the
house
report
which
says
that
tinker
is
overruled
in...
i
mean,
when
they
passed
the
statute.
it
says
they...
willful
means
deliberate
or
intentional.
to
the
extent
that
tinker
v.
colwell
held
a
looser
standard,
it's
overruled.
of
course,
in
enacting
the
statute
they
didn't
change
the
language.
a
little
hard
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
a
good
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
you
could--
--well--
--be
malicious
without
being
intentional,
then
what
about
the
act
of
practicing
medicine,
not
having
malpractice
insurance
and
then
injuring
your
patients
through
negligently
failing
to
look
up
the
right
remedies?
i
mean,
if
you
can
have...
what
is...
i
mean,
practicing...
for
a
doctor
to
practice
medicine,
doesn't
have
malpractice
insurance,
just
goes
bankrupt
and
can't
pay
the
debt,
i
mean,
is
that
the
equivalent
today
to
what
criminal
conversation
was
100
years
ago?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
and
you'd
have
to
say
it's
not
intentional,
but
malicious.
i
mean,
the
argument
he's
making
from
tinker
is
that
it
is...
it
is...
it's
not
intentional,
or
it
is
intentional,
exactly
like
here.
in
tinker,
you
could
have
been
found
to
fall
within
the
statute,
though
you're...
say
he
was
sleeping
with
a
woman.
he
may
have
been
negligent
and
not
known
that
she
was
married,
all
right.
he
says,
similarly
the
person
here,
the
doctor,
gave
a
certain
remedy
not
knowing,
though
he
should
have
known,
just
like
tinker
should
have
known,
what
the
right
remedy
was.
so
he
says,
that's
all
of
a
muchness.
i
mean,
that's
the
same
case,
he
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
the
argument
i
think
they
argued
that
he
didn't
have
to
know,
and
that
rather
he
ran
the
risk
of
the
woman
being
married.
i
think
we're
going
to
get
back
to
the
18th
century
pretty
soon,
the
statute
of
anne
again.
