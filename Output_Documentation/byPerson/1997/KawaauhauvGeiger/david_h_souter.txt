justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
trouble
in
tinker
was
that
the
act
which
the
defendant
performed
could
not,
as
a
matter
of
law
or
as
a
matter
of
definition,
be
performed
without
the
necessary
consequence
of
the
kind
of
injury
for
which
the
law
allowed
recovery.
that
is
not
the
case
here.
the
relationship
between
any
deficiency
in
the
doctor's
care
and
the
ultimate
loss
of
the
leg
was
not
a
relationship
as
a
matter
of
law
or
as
a
matter
of
definition.
it
was
a
contingent
factual
relationship.
it
turned
out
that
way,
but
you
can't
say,
i
think,
that
at
any
given
moment
when
he
decided
to
use
an
oral
antibiotic
as
opposed
to
an
injection
or
what
not,
that
there
was
any
kind
of
legal
inevitability
to
the
consequence
for
which
the
plaintiff
is
seeking
to
recover
and
that,
i
think,
is
why
you
have
a
problem
in
relying
on
tinker.
justice
david
h.
souter
there's...
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
in
anyone's
mind
that
it
did.
i
don't
believe
the
people
on
the
other
side
will
argue
or
have
suggested
that
it
did.
but
in
fact,
the
relationship
is
one
of
simple
factual
cause
and
effect.
it
is
not
the
kind
of
necessity
relationship
that
tinker
relied
upon.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
pressman,
i...
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
this.
one
of
the
questions
that
i
had,
and
i
had
it
even
after
reading
tinker,
was
whether
there
was
redundancy
in
the
statute
unless
i
read
it
your
way,
and
i
decided
that
there
wasn't
redundancy
in
the
statute
and
this
is
the
way
i
worked
it
out,
and
you
tell
me
whether
i'm
wrong,
or
whether
tinker
is
inconsistent
with
this.
it's
got
to
be
willful
and
malicious.
we
start,
i
guess,
with
the
definition
of
malicious
as
the
act
whose
purpose
is
to
harm
the
third
party.
i
don't
suppose
willful
adds
anything
to
that
sense
of
malicious.
you
can't
be
any
worse
than
that.
but
there's
also
a
sense
of
malicious
in
which,
although
you
do
not
personally
have
a
purpose
or
an
animus
to
hurt
the
victim,
what
you
do
inevitably
will
hurt
the
victim,
and
i
think
that's
what
was
going
on
in
tinker.
in
that
sense
of
malicious,
the
word
willful
does
add
something,
because
if
you
take
willful
there
to
mean,
he
knows
it's
going
to
hurt
the
other
person,
he
knows
the
inevitability
of
it
and
he
does
it
anyway,
knowing
that
that
will
be
the
consequence,
that,
then,
as
it
were,
jacks
up
the
moral
reprehensibility,
the
seriousness
of
the
act.
so
in
the
weaker
sense
of
malicious,
willful
adds
something,
and
i
thought
that
was
consistent
with
tinker.
am
i
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're--
--you'd
say
that
was
malicious.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
using
malicious
in
the
sense
of
doing
any
wrongful
act
without
just
excuse,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
that
the...
well,
i
guess
you
do
think
that
that,
maybe
third
or
weakest
sense
of
malice
is
the
sense
in
which
this...
that
this
statute
used
it,
but
if
that
is
the
case,
then
the
word
willful
adds
the
requirement
that
the
harm
that
results
to
whatever
the
eventual
victim
is
be
a
harm
which
is
either
intended
or
known
by
the
actor
to
be
the
necessary
consequence
and
if
that's
what
willful
does
in
this
case,
that
doesn't
fit
your
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
--just
as
a
matter
of...
the
definition
of
the
offense,
could
it
have
been
criminal
conversation
if
he
didn't
know?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
assuming
that
it
couldn't
have
been
criminal
conversation
unless
he,
in
fact,
knew
of
the
marriage.
am
i
wrong?
i
assumed
so,
too,
unless--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
do
you
have
to
know
that
the
defendant
knew
that
there
was
a
marriage?
justice
david
h.
souter
that
he
knew
that
the
woman
he
was
sleeping
with
was
married?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
however
you
read
it,
isn't
it
fair
to
say
that
either
he
did
not
have
to
know
of
the
marriage,
but
the
injury
followed
as
a
matter
of
law
whether
he
knew
or
not,
or
that
he
did
have
to
know
of
the
marriage
and
therefore
we
should
assume
simply
by
the
definition
of
the
offense
that
he
knew
in
this
case,
and
therefore
the
injury
followed
as
a
matter
of
law.
one...
either
way,
the
injury
in
that
case
was
inevitable
and
the
injury
in
this
case
is
not,
isn't
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
distinction
that
you
would
rely
on?
justice
david
h.
souter
nor
was
the
injury,
as
it
were,
logically
a
necessity
of
whatever
deficiency
he
may
have
been
guilty
of.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
happened,
but
it
didn't
necessarily
happen.
