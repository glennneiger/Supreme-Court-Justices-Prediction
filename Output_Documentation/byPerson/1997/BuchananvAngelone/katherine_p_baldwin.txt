ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
very
important
in
this
case
to
understand
what
issue
is
before
the
court,
and
what
the
instructions
are
that
buchanan
asked
for
at
trial,
and
in
this
respect,
first
of
all
there
was
never
an
objection
made
whatsoever
to
the
virginia
pattern
jury
instructions.
not
only
was
there
no
objection
made,
defense
counsel
expressly
agreed
that
that
instruc...
those
instructions
should
be
given,
the
ones
that
were
given
in
this
case,
as
well
as
an
express
agreeal
that
the...
agreement
that
the
verdict
forms
as
written
should
be
presented
to
the
jury.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
think
it's
very
important
to
know
exactly
what
those
instructions
were
as
far
as
what
this
court
has
said
the
eighth
amendment
requires.
this
is
what...
on
page
75
of
the
appendix...
this
is
what
buchanan
asked
the
court
for,
and
this
is
what
buchanan
says
the
eighth
amendment
requires
that
juries
be
instructed,
and
that
is
that
if
the
jury...
there
are
four
factors
which
he
identified,
page
75
and
76
of
the
appendix,
and
in
each
one
of
those
the
instruction
reads
that
if
the
jury
finds
a
particular
factor
to
be
present,
"then
that
is
a
fact
which
mitigates
against
imposing
the
death
penalty.
"
now,
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
eighth
amendment
extends
to
instructing
a
jury
in
a
capital
murder...
a
sentencing
hearing
that
a
particular
fact
is
mitigating.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
under
virginia
law,
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
virginia
statutory
system
to
say
that
trial
courts
should
not
give
specific
instructions
on
specific
factors,
because
to
do
so
could--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--under
the
virginia
supreme
court
rule
it
would,
and
the
issue
before
the
court--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
because
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
said,
and
the
issue
before
the
court
today,
is
whether
that
was
constitutionally
reasonable.
what
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
said
is
that
that
could
run
the
risk
of
having
the
jury
think
that
they
can
only
consider
certain
factors
to
the
exclusion
of
others.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
if
he
was...
justice
stevens,
if
he
was
also
given
the
catch
all,
is
that
the
question?
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
it's
our
position
that
the
virginia
pattern
instructions
which
were
given
in
this
case
accomplished
that
fact.
they
tell
the
jury
to
consider
all
the
evidence.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no...
no,
you
are
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
and
in
fact
in
some
cases
a
particular
judge
has
used
his
discretion
to
give
instructions
further
than...
that
go
further--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--than
the
virginia
pattern
instructions,
and--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes,
you're
absolutely...
in
fact,
the
age
instruction,
which
is
on
page
76
of
the
appendix,
is
different
from
the
other
three.
in
fact,
it
goes
even
further.
it...
it
doesn't
say
the
age
is
something
that
you
may
consider
as
a
mitigating
factor.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
it
says,
the
age
of
douglas
buchanan
is
a
fact
which
mitigates.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that's
correct,
and
that's
why
the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--and
that--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that's
right,
and
that
is
why
the
virginia
supreme
court
has
interpreted
the
statutory
system
to...
such
that
the
courts
should
not
and
may
not
give
specific
instructions
that
highlight
or
single
out
certain
factors
which
may
or
may
not
be
mitigating.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
no,
i
disagree
with
you,
justice
breyer.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
because
i
think...
and
my
argument
is
not
that
he
has
not
preserved
an
objection
to
the
refusal
of
these
instructions.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
my
argument
is,
that
is
all
that
he
has
preserved,
not
that
he's--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--my
response
is
still
that
he
is
not...
i
don't
believe...
his
argument
on
brief
and
his
argument
this
morning
is
to
look
at
the
virginia
pattern
instructions
that
are
given
and
to
complain
that
the
phrase,
all
the
evidence,
does
not--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--does
not
allow--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
if
his
argument
is
somehow
only
married
to
that
one
instruction...
and
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
his
argument
is
that
he
should
have
all
the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--right.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
but
it's
merely
duplicative.
it's
merely
cumulative
of
the
instruction
that
already
was
given.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
right.
it's
a
package.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
correct,
and
in
fact
the
record...
it's
not
in
the
appendix,
but
in
the
record
of
the
case,
what
the...
what
buchanan
actually
asked
for
initially,
and
then
he
himself
voluntarily
withdrew,
were
a
number
of
jury
verdict
forms
and
other
instructions
that
clearly
set
the
whole
system
up
as
a
weighing
system.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
mm
hmm.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i'm
looking
at
the
second
sentence.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
and
there
would
be
nothing
wrong
with
that,
that
one
sentence,
but
that's
not
the
instruction
that
was
offered.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
frankly
it's
been
hard
for
me
to
figure
out
exactly
what
the
issue
is
that
he
is
saying
the
eighth
amendment
requires
in
this
case,
because
it
seems
to
me
he's
changed
it
from
trial
to
direct
appeal
to
collateral
review
to
here,
and
i
think
that
the
important
issue
for
this
court
to
decide
is,
this
is
a
coll...
this
is
a
case
that
is
10
years
old.
it
is
here
on
collateral
review,
and
the
court
must,
before
it
can
consider
granting
relief,
determine
whether
what
he's
asking
for
is
a
new
rule.
and
to
do
that,
what
we
have
to
do
is
look
at
what
was
done
in
the
case
and
the
rulings
that
were
made,
and
were
those
constitutionally
reasonable,
and
on
that
score
we
have,
i
believe,
a
strong
argument
that
considering
what
this
court
has
said
the
eighth
amendment
required
in
capital
sentencing
hearings
in
1989,
when
the
virginia
supreme
court
decided
this
case,
1990
when
it
became
final,
or
even
today,
clearly
the
virginia
supreme
court
rule
and
the
instructions
that
were
given
fell
well
within
constitutional
parameters.
what
this
court
has
made
very
clear
is
that
there
are
only
two
requirements
from
the
eighth
amendment
as
far
as
capital
sentencing
hearings,
and
one
is
that
the
class
of
persons
eligible
for
the
death
penalty
in
the
first
place
has
to
be
narrowed
and,
secondly,
that
the
jury
not
be
prevented
from
considering
any
evidence,
relevant
evidence
in
mitigation.
this
court
has
never
held
that
specific
instructions
need
to
be
given
to
a
jury
considering
the
sentencing
hearing
and,
in
fact,
has
said
over
and
over
that
states
are
free
to
structure
and
shape
what
types...
what
the
procedure
is
going
to
be
in
the
hearing.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
what
buchanan
has
argued
all...
what
he
argued
on
direct
appeal,
which
is
what
we
say
is
preserved,
was
that
his
instructions
that
were
refused
were
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment,
and
that
included
instruction
(a)(b).
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
now,
that
was
definitely
not
preserved,
justice
kennedy,
absolutely
not,
because
there
was--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--all
right.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
to
my
knowledge,
this
court
has
never
held
that.
what
the
court
has
held
is
that
a
defendant...
is
that
a
jury
may
not
be
prevented
from
considering
any
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
there's
never
been
a
question
in
this
case
the
jurors
understood
their
duty
when
they
were
told
to
consider
all
the
evidence,
and
the
court
has
never
said
we
hold--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--no,
he...
that's
a
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
when
the
sentencer
says,
i
refuse
to
consider
it,
or--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that's
exactly
right.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
exactly
right.
that's--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes.
it...
yes.
the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
the
standard
comes
from
boyde,
and
boyde
says
that
the
standard
is
not
if
there's
a
possibility
that
there
was
some
misunderstanding.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
or
incorrect--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--but
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
likelihood--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--there
can't
be
in
this
case.
it
is
impossible
for
that
to
have
occurred
in
this
case,
because
of
the
considerations
that
you
look
at
under
boyde.
it
is
not
just
the
instruction.
now,
i
would
argue
that
that
reading--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--that
you
have
to
look
at
everything.
you
have
to--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
it
does...
collapses
the
two
parts
at
all,
because
the
eligibility
instructions
are
in
the
first...
are
in
the
second
paragraph.
these
are
a
number
of
instructions
that
happened
to
be
in
various
different
paragraphs,
but
there
are
a
number
of
instructions.
you
have
to
understand
something
that
virginia
does.
virginia
triple
narrows
for
the
class
of
eligibles,
i
think
unlike
any
other
state
that
i
know
of.
in
virginia,
in
the
guilt
phase
we
can't
get
a
capital
murder
unless
it
is
a
premeditated
murder
and
unless
it
is
a
premeditated
murder
coupled
with
another
circumstance,
such
as
in
this
case,
the
killing
of
more
than
one
person
in
a
single
transaction.
and
then
in
the
sentencing
phase,
we
have
a
third
narrowing
of
class
eligibles
by
a
requirement
of
finding
one
of
two
additional
aggravating
factors.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
don't
believe
it
is
at
all,
and
i
think
especially
because
the
record
shows
that
buchanan
agreed
to
these...
to
the
pattern
instructions.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
they're
the
whole
guts
of
it.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
it
is
complete...
it
is
our
position
that
it
is
completely--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--you
can't
stop
because--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
the
important
word
here--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--well,
and
it's
our
position
that
virginia
does
that.
justice
kennedy,
it's
important...
and
i
don't
believe
that
this
issue
we're
talking
about,
and
that
is
an
interpretation
of
this
paragraph
as
being
somehow
ambiguous,
i
don't
believe
that's
preserved
at
all.
it
was
not
raised,
an
objection
to
this.
however,
the
fourth
circuit,
in
other
cases
where
it
has
been
preserved,
has
rejected
this
exact
argument
by
saying
that
what
a
jury
is...
what
a
jury
may
do,
they're
free
not
to
do,
and
this
is
in
essence
a
followup
to
the
second
paragraph
that
says,
jury,
before
you
can
even
consider
a
death
penalty,
before
you
can
even
consider
two
options,
you
have
to
find
that
it's
vile.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
now,
if
you
find--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--thank
you.
now,
if
you
find
that
it's
vile...
this
is
in
the
third
paragraph...
you
may
sentence
him
to
death,
or
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified...
i...
to
say--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--to
say
that
the
jury
is
going
to
read
this
and
stop
there
and
not
read
the
rest
of
their
instructions
is
a
presumption
that
i
don't
think
this
court
has
ever
indulged
in.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that
a
jury
doesn't
read
it's
instructions.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
well,
i
think
the...
i
think
instruction
is
incredibly
simple,
and
i
think
that
no...
it's
not
a
reasonable
probability,
i
don't
think
it's
any
probability
that
a
jury,
reading
this
entire
instruction--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--could
possibly
come
away
with
the
belief
that
they
somehow
can't
consider
mitigation,
they
can't
consider
the
evidence
that
the
defendant's
put
on
for
2
days--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--yes,
i
agree,
justice
scalia.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
that's
not
correct
because...
i
think
because
of
what
the
court
has
said
in
case
after
case
about
states
being
free
to
structure
and
shape
their
sentencing
hearings.
in
this...
and
the
argument
that
buchanan
makes
as
to
all
the
other
states
is
completely
beside
the
point,
because
there's
really
no
state
that's
like
another
state
completely.
i
mean,
that's
a
comparison
that
has
no
constitutional
significance.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
think
what
justice
breyer
pointed
out
in
texas.
in
texas...
in
fact,
in
texas,
not
only
is
the
word
mitigation
not
used
under
the
cases
where
the
system
has
been
upheld,
but
it's
a
much
more
restrictive
system
than
virginia.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
the
virginia
system
is
that
even
if
an
aggravating
factor
is
found--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--and
no
mitigating
factors,
a
jury
in
virginia
is
still
free
to
give
a
life
sentence.
that's
the
argument
that
penry
asked
for,
and
that
this
court
said
you
didn't
have
to
go
that
far.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
don't
know
that
their
argument
is
that
no
other
state
would
have
accepted
it,
justice
stevens.
their
argument
is,
look
at
this
compilation
of
statutes
and
instructions
from
apparently
today
and
see
how
different
they
are
from
virginia.
i'm
not
sure
that...
no
other
state
supreme
court
could
pass
on
that,
because
they
don't
have
the
system
that
we
have.
our
system
under
this
instruction,
and
under
boyde
i
think
it's
very
important
to
look
at,
you're
not
only
looking
at
this
instruction,
because
even
if
the
court
believes
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
instruction,
and
i
don't
believe
there
is,
but
even
if
the
court
does,
under
boyde
there's
no
possibility
that
the
jury
in
this
case
believes
that
it
was
prevented
from
considering
mitigating
evidence.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
i
think
that's
taking
a--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
think
that's
taken--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--i
think
that's
one
word
taken
out
of
context.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
and
if
you
look
at
the
context
of
the
prosecutor's--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--argument
he
made
very
clear
that
what
he
was
talking
about
specifically
was,
even
if
you
find
vileness,
jury,
it's
your
duty
to
consider
his
mitigation,
and
you
can
come
back
with
a
life
sentence,
and
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
anything
different
because
that's
not
the
law,
and
that's
what
the
prosecutor
said
over
and
over.
plus
at
the
very
end
of
the
prosecutor's
rebuttal
closing
argument,
he
read
the
jury
verdict
form
to
the
jury,
and
in
that
jury
verdict
form
is
where
it
says,
where
the
jury
certifies
that
it
considered
mitigating
evidence,
and
then
the
jury
came--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--but
there
has
never
been
a
ruling
that
a
state
court
has
to
use
a
specific
word,
even
the
word
mitigation.
mitigation
is
a
lawyer
word.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
yes.
there...
it
has
been
incorporated
in
it
now,
but
under
the
instructions
that
buchanan's
jury
were
given,
they
were
absolutely
constitutionally
reasonable.
what
the
jury
was
told
is,
consider
all
the
evidence,
and
then
in
their
verdict
form
they
were
told,
you
have
to
certify
that
you
considered
all
the
evidence
in
mitigation,
and
then
you
have
both
attorneys
arguing
not
just
that
they
have
to
consider
mitigation,
but
telling
the
jury
what
mitigation
was,
and
describing
it
to
them
in
great
detail
in
general
sense
and
in
a
statutory
sense,
and
this
is
a
jury
that
knew
how
to
ask
questions,
too,
because
in
the
guilt
phase
they
came
back
and
asked
for
a
definition
of
a
particular
instruction.
this
jury
asked
no
questions
when
they
were
sent
back
to
the
jury
room
with
the
jury
instructions
and
the
written
verdict
forms,
and
when
they
came
back
and
the
written
verdict
form
certifying
that
they
had
considered
all
the
evidence
in
mitigation
was
read
in
open
court,
the
trial
judge
polled
each
juror
individually
and
said,
is
that
your
verdict,
and
each
one
said
that
it
was,
so
the--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--as
well
as
two
written
verdict
forms,
one
for
life
and
one
for
death,
and
the
judge
read
in
open
court
the
jury
instructions
and
said
i'm
also
sending
back
the
jury
verdict
forms
with
you,
and
then
the
prosecutor
in
his
closing
argument
read
the
jury
verdict
form,
including
the
words
certifying
that
they
had
considered
the
evidence
in
mitigation.
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
and
the
instructions
went
into
the
jury
room,
and
it
is
i
think
a
cynical
view
of
juries
to
say
that
they
did
not
read
these
instructions,
or
did
not
read
the
verdict
form,
and
then
certified
that
they
had
in
fact
considered
the
evidence
in
mitigation,
when
that
was
the
only
issue
before
the
jury
for
2
days
of
evidence.
it
was
conceded
by
both
sides
what
their
duty
was,
what
the
evidence
was,
even
the
fact
that
there
had
been
mitigation
that
had
been
proven.
the
prosecutor
said
if
the
only
issue
was,
is
there
mitigation,
we
could
have
all
gone
home
thursday
night.
i
mean,
this
was...
there
was
no
question
in
this
case,
much
less
a
reasonable
probability,
that
the
jury
took
these
instructions
that
they
were
given
and
then
somehow
believed
when
they
went
back
to
the
jury
room
after
hearing
that,
the
prosecutor's
argument,
and
after
reading
the
instructions,
and
after
listening
to
2
days
of
evidence,
that
somehow
they
were
precluded
from
considering
the
evidence
in
the
defendant's
favor
that
he
had
put
on,
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
the
word
mitigation
has
to
be
used
in
a
jury
instruction
sentencing
phase,
or
that--
ms.
katherine
p.
baldwin
--thank
you.
