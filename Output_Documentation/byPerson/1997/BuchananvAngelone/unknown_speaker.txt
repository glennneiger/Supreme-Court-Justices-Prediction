unknown

mr.
zerkin,
is
the
instruction
given
here
typical
of
the
instruction
that
is
routinely
given
in
virginia
in
these
capital
cases,
or
is
it
different?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
specific
test
that
you
say
we
must
employ
in
determining
whether
these
instructions
necessitate
overturning--
unknown
speaker
--the
sentence
or
the
trial?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what's
the
test
that
we
employ?
now,
i
had
thought...
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
i
thought
the
test
was,
is
there
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
applied
the
instruction
in
such
a
way
that
the
jury
was
prevented
from
considering
constitutionally
relevant
evidence.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
applied
the
instructions--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
case
in
such
a
way
that
they
were
prevented
from
considering
constitutionally
relevant
evidence.
now,
i
thought
that
was
the
test
we
employed.
unknown
speaker
right
or
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judge
says
to
the
jury,
you
are
to
consider
all
of
the
evidence
that
comes
in
at
trial.
unknown
speaker
and
certainly
there
was
evidence
that
came
in
of
a
mitigating
nature.
there
was
such.
unknown
speaker
and
the
judge
says,
consider
everything
here.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
would
your
answer
be
different
if
the
judge
had
modified
his
instruction
in
this
respect.
instead
of
saying,
if
after
considering
all
of
the
evidence
you
may
determine
that
death
is
not
justified,
if
he
had
said,
after
considering
all
the
evidence,
including
such
evidence
as
you
find
to
be
in
mitigation,
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified,
would
that
pass
muster?
unknown
speaker
but
we're
talking
about
the
constitutional
minimum,
not
the
model
charge,
which
i
take
it
is
a
considerable
improvement.
but
what
you're
saying
is,
essentially
four
words
were
missing.
after
the
words
telling
the
jury
that
they
were
to
consider
all
the
evidence,
if
the
judge
had
said,
including
the
mitigating
evidence,
those
four
words,
that
would
have
brought
it
within
the
constitutional
zone?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
jury
had
to
be
able
to
consider
any
mitigating
factors.
if
i
were
a
trial
judge
i'd
be
worried
about
specifically
reciting
mitigating
factors
lest
a
defense
attorney
come
before
an
appellate
court
and
say,
the
jury
got
the
impression
that
these
were
the
only
mitigating.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
zerkin,
i
think
you
answered
my
question,
yes,
it
would
have
been
enough.
i
mean,
you
are
now
arguing
for
more,
but
i
think
when
i
asked
you,
suppose
those
four
words
had
been
included,
including
the
mitigating
evidence
without
a
laundry
list,
that
that
would
have
been
enough
to
satisfy
the
constitutional
requirement.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
giving
very
confusing
answers.
let
me
ask
you
this
way.
suppose
the
judge
here
had
instructed
on
virginia
statutory
mitigating
evidence
and
that's
all.
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
judge
had
done
that.
unknown
speaker
and
are
you
saying
that
he
had
to
read
the
list
from
the
statute
of
the
mitigating
evidence?
unknown
speaker
but
now,
the
only...
the
only
objection
that
you
preserved,
as
i
understand
it,
was
that
you
requested
the
judge
to
charge
that
in
several
instances
a
particular
kind
of
evidence
was
mitigating
evidence.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
ask
for
a
definition
of
mitigation.
unknown
speaker
are
you...
i'm
talking
to
you
about
what
instructions
you
requested.
when
you
say
every
stage
of
the
proceedings
from
the
trial
on,
are
you
answering
my
question,
or
are
you
framing
it
differently?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
the
test
is
as
i
articulated
it,
is
there
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
was
prevented
from
considering
the
evidence,
the
answer
to
that
may
be
no,
because
the
judge
said
you
will
consider
all
the
evidence.
and
there's
one
other
factor
that
you
haven't
talked
about
here.
both
the
prosecutor
and
defense
counsel
argued
to
the
jury
that
they
should
consider,
of
course,
the
mitigating
evidence,
so
is
there
a
reasonable
likelihood
under
those
circumstances
that
this
jury
was
prevented
from
considering
evidence
in
mitigation?
unknown
speaker
well,
judges
always
say
that,
but
this
court
also
in
other
cases
has
looked
to
the
whole
picture
and
what
was
argued
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
no
question,
is
there,
that
both
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
counsel
told
the
jury,
yes,
you're
going
to
consider
these--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let's
just
take
the
judge's
instructions.
he
says,
you
may
fix
the
punishment
of
the
defendant
at
death,
or,
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified,
then...
then
you
shall
fix
the
punishment
of
the
defendant
at
life
imprisonment.
now,
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence.
there
was
something
like
2
days
of
testimony--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
trial
about
his
abused
youth,
and
about
his
psychological
problems.
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
the
jury
thought
this
evidence
was
coming
in
for?
unknown
speaker
any
jury
that
had
sat
through
2
days
of
mitigating
testimony
about,
you
know,
the
terrible
childhood
and
so
forth,
and
then
gets
this
instruction,
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified--
unknown
speaker
--my
goodness,
you
really
think
there's--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
jury
in
its
form
of
verdict
said
that
it
had
considered
the
mitigating
evidence.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
know,
we
don't
really
know
what
the
verdict
of
the
jury
was
except
from
this
same
certificate.
unknown
speaker
did
any
juror,
other
than
the
foreman--
--are
you
suggesting
that
the
form
saying
that
the
verdict
was...
was
signed
at
the
beginning
of
the
deliberations?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
foreman
is
saying
that
they
considered
mitigating
evidence,
just
as
the
foreman
is
saying
they
voted
unanimously.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
we
not
consider
this.
as
justice
scalia...
number
1,
we
start
with
a
jury
instruction
that
did
refer
to
consideration
of
all
of
the
evidence
in
determining
what
is
justified.
number
2,
we
have,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
a
trial
record
in
which
there
were
several
days
of
testimony
which
could
only
be
regarded
as
testimony
intended
to
be
mitigating
in
the
defendant's
favor.
the
testimony
came
in.
the
jurors
i
assume
are
entitled
to
assume
that
the
judge
is
not
allowing
in
effect
irrelevant
testimony
in.
and
number
3,
although
we
do
not
allow
the
arguments
of
counsel
to
substitute
for
a
jury
instruction,
i
suppose
it
is
appropriate,
in
determining
whether
a
jury
instruction
which
would
allow
consideration
of
mitigation
to
be
sufficient,
to
bear
in
mind
that
the
prosecutor
got
up
and
in
his
own
argument
admitted
that
there
was
mitigating
evidence
and
addressed
the
question
whether
the
jury
ought
to
find
that
mitigation
adequate.
in
that
total
context,
instruction
that
would
allow
it
on
its
face,
number
2,
much
evidence
that
came
in,
number
3,
a
concession
on
the
part
of
the
prosecutor
that
there
was
mitigating
evidence,
shouldn't
we
consider
all
three
of
those
factors
in
determining
whether
the
instruction
here
is
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
missing
word,
or
the
missing
four
words.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
got
to
be
expressed.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
is
more
than
information.
this
is
information
of
a
mitigating
sort,
admitted
by
opposing
counsel
to
be
of
a
mitigating
sort,
which
could
be
considered
consistently
with
a
jury
instruction
as
mitigating
evidence.
that's
more
than
just
allowing
fact
in
without
any
instructional
basis
for
considering
it
in
mitigation
at
all.
unknown
speaker
based
on
all
the
evidence,
and
all
of
the
evidence
is
not
merely,
as
you
pointed
out,
the
number
of
victims,
but
the
evidence
of
mitigation
which
consumed
several
days
of
trial.
unknown
speaker
what
about
franklin?
unknown
speaker
what
about
franklin?
well,
guidance
about
mitigation,
i
thought
we
have
said
quite
the
opposite,
that
you
cannot
constrain
the
mitigation.
you
tell
them...
you
tell
the
jury,
mitigate.
you
know,
you
can
consider
in
mitigation
whatever
you
like.
do
you
consider
that
careful
guidance?
unknown
speaker
furman
wasn't
even
a
court
opinion.
unknown
speaker
the
court
in
a
case...
i
don't
even
know
how
to
pronounce
it.
tuilaepa?
unknown
speaker
hard
to
pronounce...
said
that
states
need
not
instruct
juries
as
to
how
to
weigh
any
particular
fact
in
a
capital
sentencing
decision.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
have
to
do
that.
unknown
speaker
what
about
franklin?
unknown
speaker
well
franklin,
as
i
read
it,
i...
you've
probably
read
it
more
carefully
and
more
recently,
but
i
thought
that
they
upheld
a
texas
instruction
that
never
mentioned
the
word
mitigation,
that
the
court
rejected
the
need
to
have
an
instruction
that
told
them
about,
you
have
to
consider
evidence
that
mitigates,
that
all
the
judge
said
in
franklin,
the
only
relevant
thing,
was
he
read
number
2...
you
know,
that
second
part
of
the
texas
thing
that
says,
the
jury
must,
to
sentence
a
person
to
death,
have
to
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
there
is
a
probability
he
will
commit
future
crimes,
and
that
was
it.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
other
relevant
instruction
there,
except
take
into
account
all
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
why
doesn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
zerkin,
the
counsel
discussed
mitigation
at
length,
both
defense
counsel
and
the
prosecutor.
did
the
trial
judge
say
anything
at
all
to
the
jury
before
or
after
the
summations?
unknown
speaker
sometimes
a
judge
will
say,
you
take
the
law
from
me
and
not
from
the
counsel.
unknown
speaker
what
did
he
say
about
the
role
of
counsel?
did
he
say
something
to
the
effect
that
what
the
lawyers
say
is
not
evidence
but
it
may
help...
or
the
law,
but
it
may
help
you
to
understand
the
law
and
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
typical
instruction.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
find
all
of
these
instructions
in
the
appendix
filed
here.
i
don't
find
the
one
you
just
read
or
anything
else,
just
a
few
of
them.
unknown
speaker
so
we
have
to
go
to
the
transcript
rather
than
the--
unknown
speaker
--appendix
for
these
other
instructions.
unknown
speaker
did
he
say,
mr.
zerkin,
as
you
have
told
us,
i
will
instruct
you
as
to
the
law,
or
did
he
say,
i
will
instruct
you
as
to
the
law?
unknown
speaker
he
said,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
to
instruct
you
as
to
the
law?
unknown
speaker
or
did
he
say,
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
to
instruct
you
as
to
the
law?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
aren't.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
if
the
instructions
went
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
the
written
instructions,
all
of
them,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
and
the
verdict
form
included
the
word
mitigation?
unknown
speaker
mr.
zerkin,
you've
not
made
any
mention...
i
don't
think
i
found
any
in
your
brief...
about
whether
the
rule
you're
arguing
for
might
be
teague
barred.
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
not
address
this.
unknown
speaker
although
the
state
has
addressed
it.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
zerkin.
ms.
baldwin,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
weren't
there
additional
instructions
that
were
requested
and
specifically
denied,
and
wasn't
there--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask...
i
think
you're
right
in
what
you're
saying,
but
do
you
think
it
would
have
been
error
for
the
judge
to
give
the
instruction?
unknown
speaker
it
suggests
that
there
may
be
no
catch
all.
that's
their...
isn't
that
their
point?
there...
but
what
would
have
been
wrong
with
giving
the
instruction
supplemented
by
a
statement
saying,
of
course,
you
may
also
consider
any
other
mitigating
evidence?
would
that
have
been
error?
unknown
speaker
why
would
it
have
been...
under...
if
the
error
is
in
not
letting...
letting
them
think
they
can't
consider
other
mitigating
evidence
if
the
judge
expressly
said
you
may
do
so,
how
could
that
violate
the
virginia
rule?
unknown
speaker
how
could
it
run
that
risk
if
he
expressly
said
otherwise?
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
i
mean...
i'm
not...
that
really
doesn't
go
to
the
constitu--
unknown
speaker
--yeah,
that--
unknown
speaker
--but
don't--
--i
understand
you're
saying...
but
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if...
why
it
would
have
been
error
if
he
had
given
the
instruction.
you
seem
to...
and
i
don't...
think
it's
not
necessary
to
your
position
if
they
fail--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
thought
it
would
be
error...
say,
for
example,
take
the
age
instruction.
the
requested
instruction...
i
put
it
away,
but
in
effect
was
you
may
consider
the
age,
and
may
consider
it
as
a
mitigating
factor,
or
a
mitigating
circumstance.
that
would
be
an
incorrect
statement
of
law,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
jury
may
or
may
not
decide
that
his
given
age
was
a
factor
in
mitigation,
but
it
would
have
been
error,
i
take
it,
to
instruct
the
jury
that
it
was
a
mitigating
factor.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
he
asked
for.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
so
do
the
other
ones.
then--
--yes.
the
other
ones
do,
too.
committed
while
he
was
under
the
influence
of
extreme--
unknown
speaker
--mental
or
emotional
disturbance.
that
is
a
fact
which
mitigates
against.
unknown
speaker
whereas
the
virginia
statute
says,
facts
in
mitigation
may
include,
but
shall
not
be
limited
to.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
say
facts
in
mitigation--
--yeah.
--do
include.
unknown
speaker
it's
up
to
the
jury
whether--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
what
i
think
is
a
separate
argument,
a
totally
separate
argument,
is
not
on
page
75
but
on
page
74,
and
in
instruction
(a)(b)
what
he
does
is,
he
asks
the
judge
in
a
separate
matter
that
was
separately
refused
simply
to
tell
the
jury
that
they
can
consider
anything
in
mitigation
growing
out
of
the
person
or
the
crime.
now,
i
take
it
his
basic
separate
argument
is
that
he
asked
the
judge
in
that
instruction,
not
the
ones
you
quoted,
to
consider...
just
consider
mitigation,
and
there
was
nothing
else
in
the
other
pattern
instructions
that
told
him
that.
so
if
your
argument
is
he
hasn't
properly
raised
the
question
he's
trying
to
raise,
i'm
slightly
stymied,
because
it
seems
to
me
he
has
in
instruction
(a)(b)
on
page
74.
now,
is
there
any
response
to
what
i
just
said?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
do.
that's
why
i
asked.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well
then,
if
you--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
fine.
but...
yeah,
but
then,
isn't
he
in
section
(a)(b)
raising
the
point
he
wants
to
make,
which
is
that
the
judge
has
to
tell
the
jury
something
about
mitigation,
because
(a)(b)
is
very
generally
phrased.
it
refers
to
nothing
specific.
now,
what
is
your
response
to
that
specific
point?
unknown
speaker
i
thought--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
zerkin
made
it
clear
that
that
was
the
model
instruction.
unknown
speaker
he
did
say
to
me,
although
it
was
somewhat
equivocal,
that
it
would
be
enough
to
say,
and
you
may
take
into
account
all
the
evidence,
including
the
mitigating
evidence,
which,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
is
essentially
what
instruction
(a)(b)
seeks,
and
that
was
denied.
that
is,
if
you
find
any
facts
which
mitigate
a
death
penalty,
mitigate
against
the
death
penalty,
you
shall
consider
those
facts.
unknown
speaker
he
has
a
separate
argument.
unknown
speaker
which
i
think
is
married
to
the
instruction,
which
is
that
the
pattern
instruction
would
be
fine
if
they'd
given
(a)(b).
but
(a)(b)--
--if
they
didn't
give
(a)(b),
it
wouldn't
be
fine.
unknown
speaker
counsel,
(a)(b)
includes
as
its
first
words,
in
addition
to
the
mitigating
factors
specified
in
other
instructions.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
(a)(b)...
meaning
the
ones
later
on.
unknown
speaker
the
things
did
come
in
a
package.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
didn't...
i
want
to
get
clear
on
(a)(b)
and
the
question
whether
we've
got
a
case
here.
as
i
read
(a)(b),
there
are
two
parts
to
it
one
is
the
part
that
refers
to
other
instructions.
it
then
goes
on
to
say...
this
is
the
first
sentence.
you
shall
consider
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
offense,
the
history,
background,
et
cetera,
and
any
other
facts
in
mitigation.
that
part
of
the
request
i
assume
has
the
same
flaw,
as
you
see
it,
that
the
age
request
had.
it
in
effect
implies
that
the
facts
surrounding
the
killing
were
mitigating,
and
i
take
it
you
say
that
was
properly
refused.
unknown
speaker
but
then
there's
a
second
sentence.
if
you
find
the
existence
of
any
facts
which
mitigate,
then
you
shall
consider
these
facts.
that,
i
take
it,
even
on
your
view,
was
not
a
request
which
it
would
have
been
erroneous
to
give
as
an
instruction,
and
that's
the
request
that
raises
this
issue.
am
i
correct?
unknown
speaker
yeah.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
quite
agree,
but
i
mean,
we've
got
two
issues
here.
number
1
is,
did
he
truly
raise
the
issue
that
we've
taken
this
case
for,
and
i
assume
that
the
second
sentence
is
at
least
enough
to
get
him
across
the
line
on
that.
unknown
speaker
ms.
baldwin,
the
questions
presented
in
petitioner's
petition
for
certiorari,
the
first
question...
i
think
it's
the
first
one
that
we
granted
cert
on...
does
say,
is
the
eighth
amendment
right
to
be
free
from
arbitrary
and
capricious
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
violated
when
the
jury
is
not
instructed
regarding
the
existence
of
statutorily
defined
mitigating
circumstances,
so
i
really...
i
took
it
to
be
a
requirement
that
the
jury...
(a)(b)
wasn't
at
issue.
it
was
rather
the
later
instructions,
ah
and
so
forth,
which
does
say
you
will
consider
age
and
so
forth
in
mitigation.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
fairness
to
the
petitioner,
the
question
presented
also
concludes
with,
where
the
jury
charge
is
devoid
of
any
reference
to
the
concept
of
mitigation,
so
we
can...
can
we
discuss
just
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that
it
was
preserved.
unknown
speaker
his
argument
is
that,
given
our
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
you
have
to
give
the
jury
some
framework,
some
guidance
for
considering
whether
or
not
factors
that
have
been
introduced
into
evidence
may
be
mitigating.
now,
would
you
tell
us
what's
wrong
with
that
position,
if
that--
unknown
speaker
--can
a...
does
a
juror
perform
his
or
her
constitutional
duty
when
he
says,
i'm
not
going
to
consider
any
evidence
of
mitigation
in
this
case?
i
don't
want
to
even
talk
about
it.
i
don't
want
to
even
consider
it.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
a
violation
of
a
judge's
charge
to
the
jury
here
if
he
tells
them
to
consider
all
the
evidence,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
a
juror
that
justice
kennedy
hypothesized
were
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
consider
any
mitigating...
he
would
be
violating
the
judge's
charge
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
which
told
the
jury
to
consider
all
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
that's
the
part
that
i'm
actually
interested
in.
unknown
speaker
leaving
aside
the
structural
thing
and
whether
you
have
to
structure
it
or
not,
let
me
go
back
to
justice
o'connor's
original
point.
is
there
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
the
jury
applied
the
instruction
in
such
a
way
that
the
jury
was
prevented
from
considering
constitutionally
relevant
evidence?
all
right.
that's
the
standard
i'm
focusing
on.
let
me
read
to
you
exactly
what's
bothering
me,
and
i'll
leave
a
few
words
out
of
that
instruction
and
i'll
use
my
tone
of
voice
so
you
can
see
what's
bothering
me,
even
though,
i
grant
you,
as
justice
scalia
said,
he
probably
read
this,
the
judge,
in
a
monotone.
but
i
won't.
this
is
the
instruction,
modified
a
little,
i
think
in
harmless
ways.
if
you
find
from
the
evidence
that
the
commonwealth
has
proved
vileness,
then
you
may
fix
the
punishment
at
death.
all
right?
or,
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified,
then
you
shall
fix
the
punishment
at
life.
now,
i've
read
that
two
or
three
different
ways
in
my
mind,
but
it
seems
to
me
one
big
way
that
stands
out
is
the
possibility
the
jury
thinks
if
we
find
vileness,
we
can
fix
death.
if
we
don't
find
vileness,
we
can
fix
life.
you
see?
and
it's
because
of
the
presence
of
that
word
justified,
and
the
presence
of
the
word,
or,
and
certainly
one
of
the
arguments
he
makes...
of
course,
that
would
be
totally
wrong.
that
would
be
incorrect
under
the
constitution.
it
would
meet
the
standard
that
justice
o'connor
mentioned.
and
i've
read
that
three
times
in
my
mind,
and
i've
come
to
thinking
that
well,
gee,
the
way
i
just
read
it
with
my
tone
of
voice
is
certainly
a
way
the
jury
might
have
understood
it,
and
that's...
that's
what
i
want
you
to
respond
to.
unknown
speaker
yeah,
a
reasonable
likelihood--
unknown
speaker
--mm
hmm.
unknown
speaker
that's
why
i
used
my
voice...
isn't
there
a
reasonable
likelihood.
no.
okay.
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
say
it's
not
because
you
have
to
look
at
the
arguments
of
counsel
and
so
forth,
i
assume.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
read
it
as
justice
breyer
did,
that
is
troublesome
indeed,
because
the
instruction
has
collapsed
both
the
eligibility
for
a
death
penalty
factor
in
with
the
sentencing
factors
in
a
single
instruction.
unknown
speaker
that
is
troublesome.
now,
i'm
not
sure
the
petitioner
raised
that.
it
is
very
hard
to
know,
looking
at
the
petition,
that
that
was
even
raised,
even
though
i
personally
would
find
it
somewhat
troublesome
had
it
been
raised.
do
you
have
comments
about
that?
unknown
speaker
what
about
justice
o'connor's
question?
was
the
point
that
she
commented
on
and
that
justice
breyer
made,
was
that
argument...
is
that
preserved
here
under
the
question
presented
in
the
proceedings
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
also
what
to
say,
i
don't
agree
that
the
words
that
justice
breyer
left
out
are
inconsequential.
i
think
the
problem
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--everything
is
summarized
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
requirements
that
must
be
proven,
and
then
the
court
says,
if
you
find
from
the
evidence
that
the
commonwealth
has
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
the
requirements
of
the
preceding
paragraph,
then
you
may
fix
the
punishment
of
the
defendant
at
death,
or
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence
that
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified,
then
you
shall
fix
the
punishment
of
the
defendant
at
life.
i
don't
see
how
that
lends
itself
to--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
think
the
only
words
i
left
out
were
the
word
life
imprisonment
and
reasonable
doubt.
i
mean,
i
don't...
the
sentence
i'm
reading...
i'll
read
the
whole
thing
if
you
want,
but
i
won't
read
it
again.
i
must
say
i
think
there's
some
merit
to
justice
breyer's
point
that
this...
the
instruction
is
in
the
dysjunctive,
with
the
or.
that's
right.
so
that
it
indicates
that
if
you
go
through
step
1...
if
you
find
from
the
evidence
that
the
government
has
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
aggravating
factors
exist,
that
were
specified
in
the
previous
paragraph,
then
you
can
stop.
unknown
speaker
and--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
you
believe
from
all
the
evidence
that
a
death
penalty
is
not
justified,
that
indicates
that
maybe
the
aggravating
factors
have
not
been
established.
unknown
speaker
and
so...
so
all
the
defendant
is
saying
is,
in
this
context
you
should
say
something
about
mitigation,
what
i
want
you
to
tell
them
about
is
the
statutory
factors.
now,
maybe
he's
wrong
about
that,
but
his
question
presented
indicates
that
where
the
jury
charge
is
devoid
of
any
reference
to
the
concept
of
mitigation,
don't
you
have
to
do
something?
unknown
speaker
is
it
correct--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
want
to
interrupt
you.
you
finish.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that
you're--
unknown
speaker
--but
isn't--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
it
correct
that
you're
assuming
that
the
jury
would
interpret
the
word
or
in
that
instruction
as
saying,
in
effect,
but
even
if
you
do
so
find,
you
may
nevertheless
do
the
rest?
because
that's...
you're
assuming
that
they
understand
the
or
means,
even
if
you
find
that,
then
there's
this
other
alternative,
but
as
justice
breyer
points
out
that
a
reasonable
juror
might
think
there
are
two
alternatives,
either
the
first
clause
or
the
second.
unknown
speaker
would
be--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
dysjunctive,
and
the
question,
i
suppose,
is
whether
a
reasonable
jury
would
think
that
what
the
dysjunction
is
is
between,
if
you
find,
and
then
you...
or
if
you
believe,
or
whether
it's
between,
then
you
may
fix
the
punishment
at
death,
or,
then
you
shall
fix
the
punishment
at
life
imprisonment,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
latter
dysjunction
is
much
more
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
another...
i...
we
sort
of
milked
this
paragraph
to
death.
may
i
ask
you
to
respond
before
you're
through,
and
do
it
at
your
own
leisure,
to
the
argument
that
they
make,
and
i
don't
know
whether
it's
valid
or
not,
that
in
every
other
state
in
the
country
that
has
capital
punishment
this
instruction
would
not
have
been
sufficient.
is
that
correct,
do
you
think?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
that's
not
an
argument
that
should
persuade
us,
but
i'm
just
kind
of
asking
you,
can
you
name
another
state
in
which
this
instruction
would
have
been
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
we're
not
challenging
the
system
as
a
whole.
that
certainly
is
acceptable.
the
question
is
whether
that
latitude
is
adequately
made
known
to
the
jury.
that's
the
question
under
this
instruction,
and
they...
and
my
specific
question
to
you...
you
named
texas.
are
they
correct
that
no
other
state
would
have
accepted
this
instruction?
unknown
speaker
well,
on
that
particular
point,
i'm
a
little
bit
concerned,
because
what
the
prosecutor
said
in
the
course
of
virtually
conceding
that
they
should
take
into
account
mitigation--
unknown
speaker
--he
says,
well,
you
are
entitled
to
follow
your
own
caprice.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
i'm
sitting
there,
a
jury,
thinking
maybe
he
means
that
we
don't
have
to
follow
the
law.
he
says
we
can
follow
our
own
caprice.
i
mean,
that
isn't
exactly
a--
unknown
speaker
--a
clear
statement
that
you
can
take
mitigation
into
account
under
the
law.
unknown
speaker
so
i'm
raising
this
to
get
your
response.
unknown
speaker
mm
hmm.
unknown
speaker
he
said
enough
in
the
rest
of
it.
unknown
speaker
couldn't
the
jury
say,
the
prosecutor
and
the
defense
counsel
spoke
about
mitigation.
that
judge,
look
at
this
charge.
he
didn't
say
one
word
about
mitigation,
and
i'm
thinking
about
how
this
court
has
handled
the
reasonable
doubt
charge.
those
words
must
be
spoken.
the
court
doesn't
have
to
define
them,
but
it
has
to
at
least
speak
the
words,
and
here
you're
saying
the
charge
is
okay
even
though
it
doesn't
even
mention
the
word
mitigation.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
used
now.
i
mean,
at
least
that
model
charge
that
we've
been
hearing
about.
unknown
speaker
the
instructions
were
given
to
them
in
writing
and
they
took
them
into
the
jury
room,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
the
instructions
went
into
the
jury
room,
too?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
baldwin.
unknown
speaker
mr.
zerkin,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
could
you
address,
mr.
zerkin,
whether
or
not
you
preserved
the
point
that
this
instruction
in
itself
is
flawed
and
that
therefore
some
corrective
measure
is
required?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
would
think...
justice
kennedy
can
speak
better
than
i,
what
he's
talking
about...
what
i
would
be
interested
in,
and
if...
is
this
particular
point,
that
this
third
paragraph
of
the
instruction,
the
word
or,
because
of
its
dysjunctive
phrasing,
was
that
raised,
and
if
so
when
and
where?
unknown
speaker
answer...
i
think
that
can
be
answered
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
you
say
it's
on
page
19
to
20
of
your
cert
petition?
let
me--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
on
the
meaning
of
mitigation
and
what
kinds
of
evidence
comprise
mitigation,
which
i
think
goes
to
the
same
point
that
you
raise
in
question
1
of
the
question
presented,
that
the
specific
mitigating
circumstances,
the
statutorily
defined
ones,
were
not
the
subject
of
the
instruction.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
specify
the
dysjunctive,
or.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--so
what
you
raised...
i'm
trying
to
be
favorable
to
you
in
this
question,
because
i
want
to
see
if
you...
and
so
don't
let
me
be
too
favorable,
but
i
take
it
you'd
raise
the
fact
that
the
instruction,
perhaps
because
of
the
word
or,
or
without
it,
or
it
didn't
mention
it,
is
a
zero,
and
since
it's
a
zero,
there's
nothing
about
mitigation
and
you
have
to
say
something.
unknown
speaker
and
in
your
calling
it
a
zero,
did
you
talk
about
the
word
or,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
does
say
having
considered...
it
does
say
having
considered
all
of
the
evidence
in
aggravation
and
mitigation.
