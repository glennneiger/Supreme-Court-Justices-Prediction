mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
douglas
buchanan
was
sentenced
to
death
by
a
jury
entirely
uninstructed
as
to
those
fundamental
eighth
amendment
principles
which
could
have
saved
his
life.
indeed,
neither
the
word
mitigation,
or
anything
related
to
mitigation,
ever
crossed
the
judge's
lips.
there
are
only
a
couple
of
virginia
inmates
who,
like
douglas
buchanan,
have
been
sentenced
to
death
and
have
preserved
challenges
to
the
absence
of
mitigation
instructions.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
justice
o'connor,
it
is...
it
was
somewhat
typical.
there
is
now
recently,
as
of
about
1993,
a
virginia
model
jury
instruction
which
is
more
expansive
and
has
a
definition
of
mitigation
in
it.
it
came
about
from
a
case
called
stewart
v.
commonwealth
in
which
the
trial
judge
gave
an
expansive
mitigation
instruction,
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
did
not
rule
on
whether
that
instruction
was
proper
because
it
had
been
given.
it
did
say
that
a
further
instruction,
which
was
really
not
very
much
more
expansive,
would
have
been
duplicative
of
what
was
given,
but
the
model
jury
instructions
now
have
that...
the
instruction
from
stewart
in
the
book.
that
did
not
exist
at
the
time
of
mr.
buchanan's
trial.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
your
honor--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes.
it's
our
position
that
the
instructions
must
reasonably
accommodate
the
dual
interest
that
this
court
has
discussed--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
test
that
applies
here--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--because
there's
no
instruction
at
all
on
the
issue
of
mitigation.
if
there
were...
the
court
has
applied--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--the
court--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--the
court
has--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--in
other
contexts,
right,
and
the
reason
i
say
other
contexts,
and
it's
critical
here,
or
it's
significant
here,
i
think
in
fact
we
pass
that
test
as
well,
and
i
will
discuss
that,
but
that
arises
in
cases
such
as
boyde
v.
california,
in
which
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
instructions
are
expansive
enough
to
allow
for
consideration
of
all
of
the
mitigating
evidence.
here,
there's
an
instruction
that
violates
gregg
in
that
it
provides
absolutely
no
guidance
and
doesn't
discuss
mitigation
at
all,
and
at
the
same
time...
but
at
the
same
time
violates
lockett,
because
what
the
judge...
what
the
trial
judge
says
is,
i
will
instruct
you
as
to
what
the
law
is
that
you
should
consider.
he
says
it
repeatedly,
and
a
number
of
jurors,
including
those
who
sat
in
the
case,
under
oath
testified
that
they
would
accept
the
instructions
and
follow
the
instructions
that
the
judge
gives.
the
judge
then,
having
said
that,
is
now
absolutely
silent
about
the
concept
of
mitigation.
in
addition,
the
instruction
that's
given--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
but
then
what
he
says
is,
your
decision
is,
impose
life
if
you
find
from
this
consideration
of
all
the
evidence
that
death
is
not
justified.
now,
justification
sounds
a
lot
more
like
aggravation
than
it
sounds
like
mitigation.
it
says--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--our
position
would
be
that
that
probably
would
pass
muster
and
obviously
even
that
wasn't
done
here.
the
baseline
at
best
is
the
instruction
that's
set
forth
in
the
footnote
of
the
first
zant
opinion,
which
although
the
court
didn't
rule
on
it,
has
significantly
more
about
mitigation
than
exists
here.
that
is,
the
judge
contrasted
it
with
aggravation.
the
judge
talked
about
it
in
terms
of
mitigation
or
extenuation.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
on
one
level,
your
honor,
yes,
and
not
on
the
other
level.
the
other
level
is
that
in
virginia,
unlike
in
georgia,
which
was
the
subject
of
the
decision
in
zant,
the
general
assembly
has
set
forth
a
specific
list
of
mitigating
factors,
and
that
those
factors
are,
under
the
decisions
in
gregg
and
the
decision
in
ramos,
the
factors
that
the
state,
representing
organized
society,
believes
are
most
relevant
to
the
sentencing
decision.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
it
was
not
a
problem
here,
your
honor,
nor
is
it
theoretically.
the
problem
is
solved
first
of
all
in
every
state,
because
every
state
has
found
it
perfectly
able
to
define
mitigating
circumstances,
including
statutory
circumstances,
and
still
have
a
catch
all
that
avoids
that,
but
in
this
particular
case,
justice
scalia,
the
defense
attorneys
proposed
a
jury
instruction
that
said
that
this
was
not
an
exclusive
list,
and
that
they
could
consider
any
other
facts.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
i
have...
justice
ginsburg,
i
have
two
positions
on
that.
one
is
in
terms
of
the
general
instruction
that
is
correct,
but
that
where,
as
in
virginia,
you
do
have
a
declaration
of
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
which
we
have,
unlike
in
georgia,
then
that
also
should
be
part
of
the
equation.
we,
i
suggest,
prevail
in--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
if
he
did
not
include
the
catch
all
it
would
be
a
lockett
violation,
clearly.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
the
ones
that
were
supported
by
the
evidence,
it's
our
position
that
he
did
have
to
do
that.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
no--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--at
every
stage
of
the
proceedings,
from
the
trial
on,
counsel
for
mr.
buchanan
has
argued
that
they
were
entitled
to...
that
he
was
entitled
to--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--no,
i
think
i'm
answering
the
question,
judge.
at
trial,
for
example,
at
pages
74
and
75
of
the
joint
appendix,
instruction
(a)(b)
said,
in
addition
to
mitigating
factors
specified
in
other
instructions
you
shall
consider
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
offense,
the
history
and
background
of
douglas
buchanan,
jr.,
and
any
other
facts
in
mitigation
of
the
offense.
so
beginning
at
the
trial
level
and
carried
all
through
the
proceedings
mr.
buchanan
has
maintained
the
fact
that
he
was
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
included
this.
now,
we're
not
here
to
prescribe
what
the
instructions
should
be.
what
we're
here
to
say
is,
he
got
absolutely
nothing,
and
he...
whatever
he's
entitled
to,
he's
entitled
to
more
than
nothing.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes,
your
honor,
because
the
trial
attorney,
the...
excuse
me.
the
trial
judge
said
repeatedly
i
am
the
one
that's
going
to
instruct
you
about
the
law.
this
court
has
looked
to--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--but--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--well,
actually
there
was
some
conflicting
argument,
because
the
prosecutor
at
one
point
said,
you
may
sentence
based
upon
your
own
caprice,
and
he
told
the
jury
that
they
can...
that
you
may...
you're
entitled
to
consider
this.
he
didn't
tell
them
that
you
had
to.
another
place
he
told
them
that
they
had
to.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
2
days--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
know
what--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--but--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--yes,
because
the
jury
can
look
at
this
instruction
and
it
can
say,
the
question
is
whether
it's
justified
or
not,
and
there
are
four
victims
in
this
case,
and
that's
what
it's
about.
it's
about
justification.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
but
we
don't
know
when
that
was
even
looked
at,
and
the--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--the
practical...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
the
practical
difficulty,
the
reality
of
trying
cases,
is
that
juries
make
decisions
based
upon
what
the...
primarily
what
the
judge
instruction
of
the
law
is.
at
least,
the
system
is
set
up
to
assume
that.
if
they
looked
at
this,
and
we
don't
know
when
they
looked
at
it,
at
the
end,
after
the
deliberative
process
was
over,
if
they
looked
at
this
form
and
they
said,
oh,
this
says
we're
supposed
to
consider
the
mitigation,
having
already
made
their
decision
about
whether
it
was
justified
or
not
based
upon
what
the
judge
told
them,
and
that's
the
first
reference
they
see
to
mitigation,
we
can
hardly
expect
that
they
then
go
back
to
the
drawing
board
and
start
all
over
again
making
a
new
decision
about
the
appropriate
sentence
based
upon
a
consideration
of
mitigation.
so
yes,
they
did...
they
signed...
they
signed
the
form,
and
they
swore
that--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--no,
your
honor.
it
was
probably
signed
at
the
end
of
the
deliberations,
that's
my
point,
and
therefore
they
had
made
their
decision.
by
the
time
they
saw
anything
from
the
judge
that
used
the
word
mitigation
they
had
already--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--that
is
correct,
and
we
have
absolutely...
because
nothing
was
given
to
the
jury
about
what
mitigation
was,
or
what
it
meant,
or
how
it
was
supposed
to
be
used,
there
was
no
context
for
it
at
all,
we
have
no
idea
what
role
that
played
in
the
deliberative
process.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
not
where
the
instruction
is
completely
devoid,
as
in
this
case,
of
any
reference
to
mitigation.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
or
the
missing
concept,
and
however
it
does
it,
that
concept
must
be
given
the
imprimatur
of
the
presiding
judge.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes.
it
must
be
expressed,
and
he
must
be
told
that
and,
indeed,
as
early
as
gregg
this
court
said
that
merely
giving
information
under
fair
procedural
rules
to
the
jury
is
not
enough.
it
would
be
unthinkable--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--i
disagree
with
the
premise
that
the
jury
instruction
allows
for
that,
and
that's
because
of
the
use
of
the
word
justification.
the
standard
set
forth
here
is
whether
the
death
penalty
is
not
justified.
the
jury
can
decide--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--to
do
that
the
court
has
to
abandon
what
i
think
has
been
its
principle
throughout
the
course
of
its
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence,
that
we
must
provide
careful
guidance
as
to
both
aggravation
and
mitigation.
it's
been
a
guiding
principle
from
the
very
beginning.
and
to
do
that
we
have
to
say,
well,
we
don't
really
care
about
whether
there's
careful
guidance
from
the
court,
or
any
guidance
from
the
court,
as
long
as
the
judge
throws
it
out
there
that
you're
free
to
do
whatever
you
want,
for
whatever
reason
you
want.
as
long
as
you
think
that
it's
justified--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--you
can
go
out
and
do
it.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
there
has
to
be
both.
those
are
dual
principles
all
coming
from
furman.
it's
dual
principles.
what
you
can't
do
is
cut
off
mitigation,
and
what
you--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--but
the
theories
all
stem
from
furman,
and
it
goes
to
gregg.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
tuilaepa.
i
hope
so.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
we're
not
talking
about--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--we're
not
talking
about
weighing.
we've
never
asked
for
a
weighing
instruction.
it's
not
a
weighing
system.
we
talked
about
the
judge
impressing
upon
the
jury
that
this
stuff
is
important.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
the...
i
don't...
i
don't
see
franklin
as
affecting
the
equation.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
that's
correct,
but
remember
that
you're
dealing--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--you're
dealing
with
the
uniqueness
of
the
texas
statutory
scheme,
and
the
standard
the
court
has
set
up
for
the
texas
scheme
is
that
there
must
be
a
vehicle
for
giving
effect
to
the
mitigating
evidence.
the
court
decided
in
franklin,
unlike
what
it
decided
in
penry,
where
it
reaches
a
different
result
and
says
it
has
to
be
an
additional
instruction,
the
court
says
in
franklin
that
you
may
give...
that
the
aggravating
circumstances
created
the
vehicle
for
discussing
with
the
jury
the
mitigating
evidence,
so
even
though
you
didn't
talk
abut
mitigation,
the
unique
aspects
of
the
texas
scheme
created
the
vehicle
for
doing
that.
that's
not
at
issue
here.
we
don't
have
those
questions
where
you
could
argue
age,
for
example,
in
the
context
of
talking
about
future
dangerousness
or
some
other...
or
deliberativeness.
that
is,
if
you're
talking
about
mental
health
issues,
whether
that's
a
vehicle
for
it
or
not.
so
the
texas
scheme
is
unique,
and
the
courts...
and
in
fact,
when
the
court
had
to
deal
with
an
issue
such
as
mental
retardation,
where
it
felt
that
that
vehicle
was
not
provided
by
the
statutory
questions
in
the
texas
scheme,
it
said
it's
not
enough,
and
you
have
to
go
back
and
tell
them
about
mitigation
so
they
can
do
it.
and
as
i
understand
it,
in
fact,
texas
has
now
added
a
fourth
question
so
that
there
is
that
vehicle,
and
every
other
state,
every
state
has
provided
instructions
on
mitigation...
whether
it's
a
weighing
state
or
nonweighing
state,
every
state
but
virginia,
and
even
now
maybe
in
virginia
under
the
new
model
jury
instructions--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--he--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--now...
yeah.
yes,
he
did.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
he
said...
he
didn't
say,
and
not
from
counsel.
he
said,
i
will
instruct
you
as
to
what
the
law
is.
he
did
it
a
couple
of
times,
including
as
he
was
about
to
give
the
jury
instruction.
he
says,
it's
the
duty
of
the
court
now
to
instruct
you
as
to
the
law
applicable
in
this
phase
of
the
proceeding,
and
he
then
went
into
the
instruction.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
i
don't
believe--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--he
did
not...
he
did
not
instruct
them
on
that.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
your
honor,
the...
what
i
just
read
to
you
comes
from
page
1573
of
the
transcript.
it's
the
introduction
to
jury
instruction.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
for
that
particular--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--for
that
particular
statement,
it
is
not
in
the
joint
appendix,
that
is
correct.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
he
said,
it's
the
duty
of
the
court...
he
said,
it's
the
duty
of
the
court
now.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes,
sir.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
i'm
not
sure
which
way
he
did
it.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
i
don't
know
which
way
he
did
it,
and
i
don't
think
that
would
make
the
difference,
or
make
up
for
the
complete
lack
of
guidance
we
have
here.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
the
written
instruction,
one
instruction
and
the
verdict
form
went
to
the
jury,
that's
correct.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
well,
there's
only
one
jury
instruction,
and
that
and
the
verdict
forms
went
to
the
jury.
they
always
go
back
in
virginia,
so
they
had
those.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
it
said...
the
verdict
form
said,
we...
having
considered
the
evidence
in
mitigation.
that's
correct.
the
difficulty
again
is
with
the
trial
judge
not
only
saying,
i'm
going
to
instruct
you,
or
the
court
is
going
to
instruct
you,
but
also
saying
that
the
state...
the
question
here
is
whether
it's
justified
or
not,
and
without
giving
any
concept
of
mitigation,
or
any
imprimatur
to
it
that
it's
valid,
i
mean,
it's--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--we
certainly
think
it
is
not
teague
barred,
judge.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
we
did
not
address
it
there,
and
we
think--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--the
state
has
addressed
it,
and
we
think
that
their
argument
on
two
points
is
so
clearly
wrong.
one
is,
they
say
that
we
have...
that
the
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
on
vagueness
has
never
been
applied
to
the
selection
phase
of
the
process
as
opposed
to
the
eligibility
phase.
this
court
did
that
in
tuilaepa
and
did
it
in
stringer
v.
black
as
well.
in
stringer,
there
was
a
vague
aggravating
circumstance
that
was
not
necessary
for
eligibility,
and
the
court
decided
that
it
affected
the
weighing
process
which,
of
course,
is
at
the
selection
phase,
so
the
court
has
very
definitely
applied
its
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
in
terms
of
vagueness
and
jury
instructions
to
the
selection
phase
as
well
as
to
the
other
phase.
and
as
i've
indicated,
this
rule
comes
clearly
from
the
roots.
it
appears
over
and
over
in
proffitt,
it
appears
in
gregg,
it
appears
in
ramos.
in
every
instance
the
court
is
telling
the
jury...
and
in
penry,
and
it's
telling
the
jury
that
mitigation,
that
this
is
something,
that
mitigation
matters,
and
the
flaw
of
instruction
clearly
must
be
that
that's
contained
in
zant.
although
the
court
didn't
rule
specifically
on
the
zant
instruction,
that
in
any
event
provided
the
jury
with
some
guidance
as
to
mitigation,
and
indicated
that
mitigation
was
something
that
mattered,
and
under
these
instructions,
the
judge...
2
days
of
evidence
comes
in,
and
the
judge
says
nothing
about
it.
i
will
save,
unless
the
court
has
other
questions,
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes,
sir.
it
was
raised
throughout.
it
was
raised
on
direct
appeal.
the
argument
on
direct
appeal
was
that
the
jury
had
received
no
guidance.
in
the
state
habeas
petition
we
raised
the
fact
that
there
was
a
failure
to
instruct
as
to
mitigating
circum--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--the
issue
of--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
that
it
was
not
specifically...
that
that
was
not
specifically
raised.
what's
been
raised
is
the
failure...
throughout
has
been
the
failure
to
mention
mitigation,
to
discuss
it,
to
describe
it,
to
give
the
statutory
mitigating
circumstances,
to
do
anything
with
mitigation
at
all.
it's
been
mr.
buchanan's
position
throughout
that
the
difficulty
here
was
that
nothing
was
done,
and
that
the
court
had...
if
he
didn't
like
his
jury
instructions,
understanding
there
was
no
model
jury
instruction
at
the
time
that
dealt
with
mitigation,
if
you
don't
like
the
ones
that
i've
done,
do
one
yourself,
come
up
with
the
issue,
and
you
know,
do
something
with
mitigation.
it
was
raised
in
the
virginia
courts
throughout,
and
the
virginia
court
in
the
state
habeas
proceeding
ruled
that
when
we
raised
it,
we
were
raising
the
same
claim
that
had
been
raised
on
direct
appeal.
they
applied
the
rule
of
the
case
hawks
v.
cox,
which
is
that
we
dealt
with
this
on
direct
appeal,
it
was
raised,
it's
preserved,
and
in
that
we
raised
all...
the
failure
to
mention
mitigation
and
all
of
those
issues.
so
that's
come
up
all
along,
and
in
the
cert
petition
at
pages
19
to
20
we
raised...
the
issue
that
we
talked
about
was
the
failure
to
do
anything
in
reference
to
mitigation,
so
that
issue
has
in
fact
been
put
before
every
court
that's
looked
at
it,
and
the
virginia
supreme
court
recognized
when
it
came
up
on
state
habeas
that
it
was
exactly
the
same
thing
that
had
been
presented
before,
and
the
same
issue
was
presented.
justice
breyer,
let
me
note
that--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--at
the
bottom
of
19
it
talk--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--it
talks
about,
absent
any
instruction
on
the
meaning
of
mitigation.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
but
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
also
in
that
question
is
that,
despite
counsel's
request
for
such
instructions,
and
where
the
jury
charge
is
devoid
of
any
reference
to
mitigation.
i
mean,
that's...
that
goes...
that
clearly
raises
that
part
of
the
issue.
there
are
two
parts
to
it.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
yes,
you
are
correct.
you
are
correct.
the
issue
that
you
raise,
justice
breyer,
is...
i
think
is
actually
exacerbated
by
the
verdict
form.
i
mean,
if
we
assume
that
the
jury
looks
at
the
verdict
form,
on
page
77
and
78
of
the
joint
appendix,
what
it...
one
of
the
verdict
forms
recites
the
fact
that
they
have
found
an
aggravating
circumstance.
the
other
verdict
form
does
not
have
the
recitation
of
an
aggravating
circumstance,
so
the--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--that's
correct.
we
have
argued--
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
--i
don't
think
we
talked
about
the
word
or.
what
we
talked
about
was
the
fact
that
the
jury
instruction
was
devoid
of
any
reference
to
mitigation.
the
difficulty
that
we
have
with
the
verdict
form
is
that
you
have...
it
exacerbates
the
problem
of
confusing
mitigation
with
aggravation,
because
what
it
says
is,
once
you
find
an
aggravating
circumstance
you
then...
the
only
choice
you
have,
the
only
place
that's
recited
is
in
the
first
verdict
form,
and
that
verdict
form
provides
one
possibility,
and
that's
death.
the
other
alternative
form
which
provides
for
a
life
verdict
doesn't
recite
the
fact
that
you
found
an
aggravating
circumstance,
so
once
again,
it
doesn't
provide
clarification
for
the
jury.
it
actually
provides
further
confusion
for
the
jury.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
it
does,
and
if
we
assume
that
that's
part
of
the
jury
instruction
and
the
jury
looked
at
it,
we
have
that
additional
problem
that
the
aggravating
circumstance
only
results
in
death,
and
it's...
where
no
aggravating
circumstance
is
found
results
in
life.
mr.
gerald
t.
zerkin
thank
you.
