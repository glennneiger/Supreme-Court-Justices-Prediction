justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-653,
kenneth
lee
baker
and
steven
robert
baker
v.
general
motors
corporation.
mr.
tribe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
you
refer
to
the
michigan
proceeding
as
a
consent
decree.
what
are
you...
what
precisely
do
you
mean
by
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
true
of
all
settlements,
isn't
it,
that
there's
no
adversary
hearing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--this
is
the
district
court
in
missouri
now?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
full
faith
and
credit
always
produces,
some
result
like
that.
supposing
the
michigan
decree
hadn't
involved
testimony.
suppose
it
involved
a
car,
and
you
go
to
missouri
and
you
say
well,
why
should
this
missouri
creditor
be
denied
the
resort
to
missouri
courts
over
this
claim
to
a
car?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
answer
is,
full
faith
and
credit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
think
you'll
find
much
disposition
on
the
court
to
enlarge
on
logan
v.
zimmerman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you'd
have
to
to
rely
on
it
the
way
you
said
you
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
tribe.
mr.
cappuccio,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--as
between
elwell
and
general
motors
i
suppose
it's
a
settlement.
if
it
had
been
contested
he
could
have
appealed
through
the
michigan
courts,
but
he
can't
collaterally
attack
the
decree--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--just
because
it
may
be
improper.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
didn't
fauntleroy
v.
lum
say
there
wasn't
any
public
policy
exception?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cappuccio.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
