but...
you
know,
this
is
troublesome
because
michigan
isn't
telling
missouri
what
to
do.
missouri
can
allow
elwell
to
be
called
to
the
stand,
and
elwell
can
say,
but
i
can't
testify
to
this.
i
decline
to
answer.
so
missouri
isn't
being
deprived
of
the--
justice
sandra
day

--process.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
plenty
of
times
witnesses
have
some
privilege
that
can
be
asserted
so
that
the
bakers
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
certain
testimony.
they
can
call
the
witness
to
the
stand.
the
witness
says,
sorry,
i'm
here,
but
this
is
privileged
information.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
know
how
other
courts
in
michigan
would
treat
this
injunction?
has
it
been
tested
in
another
suit
against
g.m.
in
michigan,
for
instance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
michigan
court
had
litigated
the
issue
of
privilege
as
between
elwell
and
general
motors--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
had
concluded
that
information
about
subject
x
was
privileged,
and
made
that
determination
and
then
said,
and
you
can't
disclose
that,
mr.
elwell,
anywhere,
anytime.
is
that
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
when
elwell
is
called
then
as
a
witness
in
another
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
have
to
address
it
in
the
due
process
context
and,
frankly,
i
hope
we
don't
have
to.
can't
we
just
ask
whether
this
is
required
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause?
why
do
we
have
to
pin
it
on
some
due
process--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i--
--mr.
cappuccio,
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
we
say,
in
accordance
with
the
restatement
rule,
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
does
not
bind
bakers,
who
were
not
privy
to
that
proceeding
in
michigan,
and
that
general
motors'
remedy
is
to
go
after
elwell
for
contempt
in
michigan--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
he
agrees
to
in
fact
testify?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
cappuccio,
by
way
of
another
example,
sometimes
we
see
court
orders
ordering
a...
an
employee
or
a
former
employee
not
to
compete
with
the
employer
in
situations
where
the
employee
and
the
first
employer
get
in
a
dispute
and
go
to
court
and
there
is
a
covenant
not
to
compete,
and
that's
enforced
by
a
court
order
in,
let's
say,
michigan,
and
the
michigan
court
says,
mr.
x,
you
will
not
compete
for
a
period
of
5
years
with
this
employer
number
1,
and
any
contract
you
enter
into
anywhere
to
do
that
is
void
and
of
no
effect.
employee
goes
to
state
2
and
enters
into
a
contract
with
a
new
employer
to
go
to
work
in
competition,
in
violation.
now,
i
guess
on
your
theory
that
contract
is
unenforceable
in
the
second
state
in
any
way
for
the
employer,
the
new
employer
who
tries
to
hire
him.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
gee,
i
would
have
thought
that
in
the
second
state
the
new
employer
could
sue
the
employee
who
entered
into
this
contract
perhaps
when
he
shouldn't
have,
and
that
the
first
employer
could
sue
him
for
breaching
the
original
order.
i
mean,
what--
