mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
reasons
why
there
cannot
possibly
be
a
due
process
objection
to
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit
here
and
justice
breyer,
your
question
raised
one
of
those
grounds
and,
justice
kennedy,
you
picked
up
on
it
and
i'm
going
to
try
to
answer
both
of
you,
and
mr.
chief
justice,
you
raised
the
other
ground,
and
probably
the
simplest
reason
is
that
ultimately
by
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit
here
we
are
just
talking
about
what
court
will
decide
whether
or
not
in
this
case
elwell
will
be
allowed
to
testify.
that's
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit,
and
that--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--your
honor,
i
respectfully
disagree.
i
don't
think
it
is.
i
think
the
restatement
is
flatly
wrong
in
what
it
said.
this
court
has
never
denied
full
faith
and
credit
to
equitable
decrees,
and
there
is
no
basis
for
distinguishing--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well,
i
can
give
you...
a
custody
decree,
for
example,
will
require
someone
to
have
or
not
have
the
child.
a...
cole
v.
cunningham,
which
was
an
antisuit
case
which
went
very
far--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--but
your
honor,
there
is
no
basis
in
either
the
language
of
section
1738
or
any
policy
of
full
faith
and
credit
to
treat
an
injunction
or
an
affirmative
injunction,
as
opposed
to
a
prohibitory
one,
any
different.
they
are
both
judicial
proceedings--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i
am
unaware--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
holding
of
fall
v.
eastin.
actually,
the
problem
in
that
case
was
that
the
court
tried
to
effect
title
to
land
directly.
but
i
think
in
that
case
the
husband
could
be
directed
to
convey
the
land,
and
i
think
the
concurrence
in
that
case--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--your
honor--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--your
honor,
two
answers
to
that.
fall
v.
eastin
is
actually
an
example
for
me,
because
i
think
it
was
justice
holmes
in
his
concurrence
thought
it
was
quite
plain
that
the
order
requiring
the
husband
to
convey
the
land
was
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit,
and
second,
we
cite
a
number
of
lower
court
cases
in
our
briefs,
including
from
the
seventh
circuit,
that
established
that
this
is
a
fairly
well-settled
issue
that
full
faith
and
credit
is
entitled
to
injunctions,
both
prohibitory
injunctions
and
affirmative
injunctions.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
no,
sir.
he
would
be
in
contempt
of
the
injunction.
but
i
understand
the
problem
here,
and
the
problem
here
is
to
1)
ask
what
sort
of
effect
is
this
having
on
third
parties,
and
is
that
effect
so
great
as
to
violate
due
process,
or
does
it
leave
them
with
a
way
to
defend
their
rights
in
a
manner
that
is
consistent
with
due
process?
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
well,
your
honor,
because
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit
is
fairly
straightforward
here,
and
this
picks
up
on
another
question
you
had.
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
says
that
the
michigan
injunction
is
entitled
to
the
very
same
force
and
effect
that
it
would
have
within
the
state
of
michigan.
that's
common
ground.
the
michigan
courts,
we
were
fortunate
in
this
case,
have
interpreted
the
force
and
effect
of
this
very
injunction,
and
the
case
that
we
cite
in
the
red
brief
is
the
brisborne
case,
and
what
second
courts
who
people
have
gone
to
have
said
is
that
the
force
and
effect
that
this
injunction
is
due
is
that
ron
elwell
is
prohibited
from
testifying
unless
and
until
somebody
goes
back
and
presents
their
claim
to
the
wayne
county,
michigan
court
to
allow
him
to
testify.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
they
were,
and
i--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well,
your
honor,
it
is
different
from...
on
the
due
process
question,
i
agree
with
you.
it
is
not
different--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well,
that--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--that
sort
of
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
these
people
are
being
bound
by
the
judgment
rather
than
being
affected
by
the
judgment
in
some
incidental
way,
but
i
think
that
bound
debate,
which
the
court
has
had
in
martin
v.
wilks,
is
just
a
proxy
for
the
due
process
analysis.
the
question--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--your--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--your
honor,
this
is
just
michigan
deciding
something
between
ron
elwell
and
general
motors
and
preventing
elwell
from
hurting
general
motors.
what
makes
this
apply
elsewhere
is
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
nothing
that
the
michigan
court
did,
and
what
that
says
is,
we
have
decided
as
a
nation
because
someone
can
step
over
the
line
and
hurt
general
motors
just
as
well
in
another
state,
that
the...
that
that
judgment
is
enforceable
everywhere.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
because,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--because,
your
honor,
with
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
requires,
again,
is
that
the
michigan
injunction
be
given
the
same
force
and
effect,
and
at
a
minimum
i
would
argue
that
requires--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
they
do
not
say
that.
the
michigan
courts--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--no,
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
the
michigan
courts'
cases
simply
say
that
someone
who
is
affected
by
the
judgment
and
seeks
to
reopen
it,
or
seeks
to
modify
it
or
challenge
it,
must
go
back
to
the
court
that
rendered
it.
it
is
merely
a
litigation
channeling
provision.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
well,
but
by...
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
that
rule
is
just
for
michigan,
but
by
operation...
this
is
the
most
important
point.
by
operation
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
that
michigan
rule
applies
to
govern
this
judgment.
it
is--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i
understand
that,
and
i
lay
that
at
the
feet
of
the
u.s.
congress,
and
they
were
wise
to
have
done
that.
that
is
what
section
1738
does.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
sure.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
jurisdiction
over
the
person
or
subject
matter,
yes,
sir.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
i
understand.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
i
agree.
he
would
be
in
contempt
if
he
did
that.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
i
can't
imagine
what
the
jurisdictional
issue
would
be.
the
court
had
jurisdiction
overt
the
persons,
and
the
court
had
jurisdiction
over
the
subject
matter,
and
they
entered
an
injunction
that
prevents
elwell
from
testifying
against
general
motors.
what
makes
it
extraterritorial
in
its
effect--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--is
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
that's--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--that's
right,
your
honor.
that's
absolutely
right,
and
that's
an
important
distinction
here
which
is
separating
the
difference
between
whether
this
injunction
is
overbroad,
which
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
decide...
i'm
not
trying
to
stifle
debate
as
to
whether
this
injunction,
by
covering
evidence
that
might
not
be
privileged,
is
overbroad,
and
whether
it's
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
absolutely,
sir,
justice
stevens.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
your
honor,
no,
because
i
disagree
with
your
use
of
the
word
bind
there,
because
the
question
is,
what
sort
of
impact
does
it
have
on
the
third
party?
you
would...
i
assume
that
the
court
would
agree
that
if
it
were
a
merely
incidental
impact
there'd
be
no
due
process
problem
at
all,
so
the
first
question
you
have
to
ask
is,
what
is
the
degree
of
the
impact?
does
it
foreclose
a
property
right,
which
is
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked,
and
then
second,
what
process
are
you
given?
and
i'm
saying
there's
no
due
process
objection
either
to
the
michigan
rule
or
to
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit,
or,
i
may
add,
to
what
congress
has
mandated,
which
is
the
exact
same
thing
in
the
1991
civil
rights
act
in
the
wake
of
martin
v.
wilks.
petitioners
in
their
brief
cite
the
statute
that
was
passed
in
the
wake
of
martin
v.
wilks,
and
what
congress
requires
is
exactly
the
same
sort
of
channeling
of
third
party
collateral...
not
collateral
attacks,
third
party
challenges
to
consent
decrees
back
to
the
court
that
issued
it.
petitioners
raised
it.
allow
me
to
read
the
rule.
first
of
all,
congress
precludes
certain
third
parties
from
raising
challenges...
if
they
had
notice,
if
they
were
adequately
represented...
but
they
recognized
there
might
be
new
third
parties
who
came
along
later
who
weren't--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--real
third
parties.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
congress
says
in
that
section,
which
is
section
2000...
2000...
do
you
have
it
here
+/?
it's
28
u.s.c.
2000e-2n.
i
have
the
actual
bill.
any
action
not
precluded
under
this
section,
meaning
real
third
parties,
the
challenges
in
employment
a
consent
judgment
or
order
described
in
paragraph
1
shall
be
brought
in
the
court
and,
if
possible,
before
the
judge
that
entered
such
judgment
or
order,
and
my
position
is
the
constitutionality
here
of
the
effect
of
full
faith
and
credit
is
indistinguishable
from
the
constitutionality
of
this
provision
by
congress,
which
is
plainly
constitutional,
because
all
it
does
is
require
parties
to
go
back
to
the
court
that
issued
it,
and
then
the
question
is
yours,
justice
kennedy--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--sorry.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
that
order
would
be
entitled...
well,
it
depends
if
there
were
a
prior
final
order--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--it
would
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit,
and
it
would
be
reversed
in
a
split
second,
your
honor,
because
it
would
be
an
abuse
and
an
illegal
order.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
well,
but
that
would
be
reviewed,
and
that's
the
point.
it
is
not
that
the
michigan
court
has
done
something
that
nobody
can
review.
there
are
at
least
two
opportunities
to
review.
there's
an
opportunity
for
direct
review
when
it's
entered,
okay.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
and
the
cites
to
that
proposition
are
dissents,
and
dicta,
and
concurrence
is
not
essential
to
holding.
and
i
commend
to
you,
justice
ginsburg,
two
law
review
articles,
one
written
by
a
man
named
william
reynolds
in
the
maryland
law
review,
and
one
written
by
a
man
named
ron
hecker,
i
think
it...
hecker
in
the
california
law
review,
and
you
will
see
that
there
is
absolutely
no
support
for
the
rather
inaptly
called
restatement
on
that
point,
because
in
fact
all
of
those
cases--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--sure.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
yes,
that's
absolutely
right,
your
honor,
but
i
come
from
just
the
opposite,
which
is,
i
start
with
1738,
which
says
they
are
all
enforceable
unless
there
is
a
reason
to
not
make
them
enforceable,
and
this
court
has
never,
ever
recognized
in
any
single
case
an
exception
based
either
upon
the
policy
interests
of
the
forum
court,
the,
worded
somewhat
differently,
institutional
integrity
of
the
forum
court,
or
the
nature
of
the
decree,
whether
it's
legal
or
injunctive,
and
i
am
saying--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--absolutely,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
my
position
is,
in
order
to
rule
for
petitioners
in
this
case
you
would
be
effectively
overruling
fauntleroy
v.
lum,
because
in
that
case--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--we
are,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
point
that
the
chief
justice
was
making
with
fauntleroy
is
that
this
court
has
never
recognized
that
the
effect
on
the
policy
forum
is
to
be
balanced
against
a
final
judgment.
and
what
i
am
saying
is,
petitioner's
formulation
of
the
exception
they're
looking
for,
which
is
to
interfere
or
commandeer
the
judicial
process,
is
merely
a
reformulation
of
the
policy
interest
in
fauntleroy.
certainly
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
would
feel
that
it
was
being
commandeered
and
its
institutional
integrity
is
being
interfered
with.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
two
answers
to
that.
first,
the
decree
is
not
saying
to
disobey
an
order.
there
was
no
order
in
place.
it
is
the
first
judgment--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--it
means
only
that
ron
elwell
cannot
testify,
and
the
effect
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
is
to
extend
that
extraterritorially.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
well,
it
would
affect
their
ability
to
have
one
witness
come
in.
i
don't
think
it
would
impair
their
jurisdiction,
but
i
do
not
see--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--sure.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
there
is
plainly
some
broad
statements,
particularly
by
justice
stone,
who
dissented
originally
in
yarborough
and
threw
some
dicta
in
later,
that
makes
it--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--no,
i
understand
it
was
in
a
majority
opinion,
but
in
that
case
it
was
absolutely
unnecessary
to
the
holding,
because
that
case
was
a
choice
of
law
case
and,
of
course,
this
court
has
held
precisely
because
congress
has
not
litigated
the
effect
of
acts,
and
because
there's
a
necessity
to
balance
interests--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--it
is,
your
honor,
one
of
the
quotes
that
the
restatement
relies
on,
and
i
am
saying
that
if
the
proverbial,
as
justice
scalia
said
once
in
his
opinion,
hapless
law
clerk
goes
back
through
those
cases,
in
none
of
those
cases
does
the
court
hold
that
there
is
an
exception
to
judgments
when
the
interests
of
the
other
state
need
to
be
weighed.
there
are
statements--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--sure.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
yes,
your
honor,
that's
it.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
absolutely,
your
honor,
and
in
that
first
judgment--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--yes,
sir,
and
my
answer--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--my
answer
is,
is
that
is
preposterous
to
think
that
the
person
who
is
affected,
the
person
who
wants
to
enter
into
the
contract--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--could
go
into
the
court
of
the
second
state
and
say,
ignore
the
judgment.
rather,
they
would
have
to
go
back
to
the
first
court
and
show
that
they
had
the
kind
of
interest
that
was
affected.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
no,
your
honor,
i
think
in
that
case
the
suit
in
the
second
case,
the
first
order
would
plainly
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
and
if
somebody
wants
to
go
back
and
claim
that
that
is
wrong,
be
it
a
party
or
a
third
party,
they
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
court.
that's
all
full
faith
and
credit
is
about.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--well,
your
honor,
there
are
two
questions,
and
let
me
try
to
answer
the
first
one
and
then
the
second
one.
the
first...
the
answer
to
the
first
one
is,
it
does
not
matter
whether
you
say
they
are
bound
or
not
bound.
that
is
a
legal
conclusion
about
what
due
process
requires.
what
matters
is
the
degree
of
impact
on
him.
does
it
affect
a
property
right,
and
i
agree
with
the
chief
justice,
you're
not
going
to...
i
hope
you
won't
extend
logan
v.
zimmerman.
they
don't
have
a
property
right
here.
that
disposes
of
this
case.
but
even
if
it
does,
what
process
are
they
entitled
to,
and
the
only
question
is,
is
it
too
much
of
a
burden
to
send
them
back
to
michigan,
and
i'm
saying
no--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--okay...
sorry.
[laughter]
whether
it's
too
much
of
a--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i'm
sorry,
i
shouldn't
have
said
back,
but
this
is
the
whole
issue
in
this
case,
is
it
too
much
of
a
burden,
does
it
violate
due
process,
and
i'm
saying
no.
because
of
the
important
interest
of
full
faith
and
credit
to
avoid
conflicting
judgments,
as
justice
breyer
talked
about--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--the
full
faith
and
credit
clause--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--that's
exactly
what
congress
did
in
the
civil
rights
act
of
1991.
it's
exactly
what
congress
did
by
reason
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
and
the
burden,
justice
kennedy,
is
not
an
undue
burden.
it's
the
same
exact
burden
that
a
litigant
faces
when
they
want
to
get
an
out-of-state
witness.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
your
honor,
i--
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
--i
would
think
that
it
would
be...
the
reason
we
don't
have
anything
is
because
it
is
so
plain
that
that
is
a
final
judgment
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
paul
t.
cappuccio
thank
you,
your
honor.
