justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
if
baker
had
had
notice
in
missouri,
i
take
it
your
position
is
he
wouldn't
have
to
go
to
michigan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
another
way
to
answer
the
question
to
just
say
that
it's
not
baker's
burden
to
undo
the
injunction,
it's
g.m.'s
burden
to
show
that
baker
is
bound,
and
it
can't
do
that
when
baker
wasn't
a
party.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
is
a
really
important
point
in
the
case.
let's
assume
there's
no
settlement
agreement.
let's
just
talk
about
conflicting
injunctions.
what
would
be
the
answer
if
there
were
no
settlement
agreement?
g.m.
says,
well...
or,
elwell
says
well,
i'm
being
told
one
thing
in
one
state
and
the
other
thing
in
the
other
state,
and
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
doesn't
the
missouri
court
also
have
the
capacity
to
instruct
g.m.
not
to
enforce
the
injunction
against
elwell
in
defiance
of
missouri's
orders?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
were
to
rule
in
your
favor
and
cite
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
would
we
also
have
to
talk
about
due
process,
or
would
we
say
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
is
complementary
to
the
basic
principles
of
the
law
of
judgments,
and
that
baker
is
just
not
bound
under
standard
principles
of
the
laws
of
judgment?
would--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
don't
have
any
square
holding.
we've
intimated
that
in
some
of
the
cases,
i
think.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
you
say
that
it's
liberty
or
property,
or
do
you
have
to
say
that
it's
one
of
the
three?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
the
two?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it
have
to
be
one?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
has
to
be
one,
doesn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
all
events,
the
other
problem
is
that
you're
trying
to
make
this
applicable
to
baker,
and
baker
is
simply
not
bound.
now,
if
g.m.
finds
itself
in
the
position
of
elwell
testifying,
and
it
tries
to
hold
elwell
in
contempt
back
in
michigan,
would
elwell
have
a
defense
on
some
sort
of
due
process
grounds,
do
you
think,
that
he
was
ordered
to
do
what
the
missouri
court
told
him
to
do
because
due
process
concerns
and
full
faith
and
credit
concerns
simply
did
not
allow
the
injunction
to
be
enforced?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
those
people
were
all
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
michigan
courts,
were
they
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
different,
because
the
bakers
are
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
as
justice
o'connor
was
indicating,
it
seems
to
me
it's
also
different
because
of
the
fundamental
law
of
judgments,
which
is
that
you
can't
apply
a
judgment
or
enforce
a
judgment
against
a
person...
against...
where
there
was
no
personal
jurisdiction
over
that
person
originally.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
just
a
simple
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
any
authority
that
the
michigan
courts
say
that
their
judgments
bind
persons
who
were
not
before
the
court,
and
over
whom
the
court
had
no
personal
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
it
doesn't
have
the
effect
that
you
seek
to
give
it
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
they're
already
in
michigan.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
the
principle?
why
can't
he
be
cited
for
contempt?
what's
the
principle?
