justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
understanding
of
the
meaning
of
the
injunction?
there's
some
difference
between
the
side
agreement
that
says
we
won't
seek
contempt
charges
if
you
testify
and
the
text
of
the
injunction
itself.
do
you
agree
that
the
injunction
in
effect
says
to
the...
this
witness,
if
you
are
subpoenaed
to
testify
or
ordered
by
a
court
in
another
state
to
testify,
you
shall
not
comply
with
that
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
it
means
that,
do
you
concede
or
do
you
dispute
that
the
michigan
court
will
have
the
power
to
enter
such
an
order?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
if
you're
right
on
that,
the
order
would
not
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
under
elementary
jurisdictional
principles.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
don't
seem
to
make
that
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
want
us
to
have
some
kind
of
a
standard
to
say
that
you
can't
interfere
with
the
vital
or
important
interests
of
the
sister
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
what--
--what
is
the
standard?
excuse
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
mr.
cappuccio,
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
only
does
it
if
the
michigan
court
had
the
power
to
enter
the
order
it
did
enter.
you
would
agree
with
that
much,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
think
there
is
any
question
at
all
about
the
power
of
a
michigan
court
to
order
a
litigant
before
it
to
refuse
to
comply
with
any
normally
lawful
court
order
that
might
be
entered
anywhere
else
in
the
country?
does
that
bother
you
at
all?
i'm
just
looking...
i'm
not
looking
about
third
parties.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
looking
just
at
elwell.
you
are
saying
to
him
if...
under
your
reading
of
the
injunction,
as
i
understand
it,
it
in
effect
says
no
matter
how
lawful
the
court
order
may
be
that
directs
you
to
testify,
you
must
refuse
on
pain
of
contempt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
there's
no
jurisdictional
issue
as
to
the
power
of
a
court
to
enter
such
an
order
as
required
full...
must
be
given
full
faith
and
credit.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
saying
any
claim
that
an
injunction
is
overbroad
in
this
sense
must
be
litigated
in
the
court
entering
the
injunction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
i
just
might...
supposing
the
order...
they
found
out
he
had
a
lot
of
documents
that
he
had
in
his
summer
home
in
wisconsin,
and
they
were
under
subpoena,
and
the
judge
in
michigan
said,
i
want
you
to
burn
those
documents
to
protect
general
motors
from
the
unlawful
access
to
those
documents,
and
there
was
an
order
in
wisconsin
said
he
can't,
he
could
only
get
relief
from
that
in
michigan,
i
guess.
he'd
have
to
go
burn
the
documents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
be
entitled...
section
order
be
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit
even
though
he
had
jurisdiction
of
the
person
and
the
subject
matter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
that
be
reversed
any
more
than
this
one?
they
might
claim
they
were
privileged
documents.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
went
to
whether,
and
a
question
that's
going
to
the
merits
of
the
holding
rather
than
the
power
to
enter
the
decree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
reasoning
went
to
the
merits
of
the
decision
rather
than
the
power
to
enter
the
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
distinction
is
very
clear
in
fauntleroy,
and
the
question
i
keep
coming
back
to
is
the
question
of,
is
there
no
limit
on
the
power
to
enter
any
kind
of
judgment
whatsoever
other
than
a
personal
jurisdiction
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
i
agree,
just
difference
in
policy,
but
here
you're
asking
him
to
say
you
must
disobey
an
order
that
every
jurisdiction
in
the
country
would
normally
say
is
a
valid
order
when
you
subpoena
somebody
to
testify,
and
you're
saying
this
decree
says,
we
don't
care
how
universal
the
approval
is
of
such
lawful
order,
you
must
disobey
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
decree
does
say
you
don't
have
to
interfere
with
the
jurisdiction
of
the
georgia
court,
but
presumably
that
means
that
any
other
court's
jurisdiction
must
be
interfered
with.
that's
in
the
decree
itself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
question
is
whether
that
impairs
the
jurisdiction
of
any
of
these
other
courts,
which
the
decree
seems
to
assume
it
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
clarify
one
thing--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
you
didn't
quite
finish
your
answer
when
justice
gins...
it
is
your
position...
i'm
just
not
looking
at
authorities
or
law
review
articles
or
restatement...
it
is
your
position
that
there
is
no
full
faith
and
credit
limitation
whatsoever,
other
than
personal
jurisdiction
and
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
court
entering
a
judgment?
