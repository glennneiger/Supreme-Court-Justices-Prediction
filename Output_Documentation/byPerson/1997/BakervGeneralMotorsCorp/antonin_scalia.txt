justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
the
property
involved
here
is
the
right
to
invoke
the
procedural
rules?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
no.
i
mean,
your
answer
is
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
context
of
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
add
to
the
fact
that
it
was
not
litigated,
so
that
there's
no...
no,
you
know,
res
judicata
effect.
it
was
a
consent
decree
in
the
first
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you'd
still
say
that
the
second
court
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose,
mr.
cappuccio,
that...
i
also...
it
was
the
exact
example
that
justice
o'connor
gave
which
has
occurred
to
me.
these
injunctions
against
competition
are
very,
very
common,
and
i
guess
they're
not
worth
a
whole
lot
if
they're
only
enforceable
in
the
particular
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
expect
a
lot
of
literature
on
the
other
side.
i
would
have
expected
a
lot
of
lawsuits
in
which
people
simply
said,
i
don't
have
to
obey
this
injunction
in
the
other
state
because
your
writ
doesn't
run
this
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
tribe,
i
don't
understand
one
thing
about
your
position.
is
it
your
position
not
only
that
the...
that
courts
in
states
other
than
michigan
are
not
bound
by
the
judgment,
but
that
also,
if
he
complies
with
the
decrees
of
these
other
courts,
that
mr.
elwood
is
not
liable
for
contempt
in
michigan?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
not
by
contract.
may
the
michigan
court
cite
him
for
contempt
if
he
complies
with
the
order
of
the
court
of
another
state
and
gives
testimony?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
that's
your
position--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
only
that
the
state
court
is
not
bound,
but
also
that
elwood
is
not
bound?
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
if
he
goes
to
that
state
in
order
to
be
subpoenaed,
which
is
what
happened
here,
apparently.
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
hypothesize
it,
then.
suppose
he
goes
to
that
state
expecting
and
hoping
to
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--okay.
