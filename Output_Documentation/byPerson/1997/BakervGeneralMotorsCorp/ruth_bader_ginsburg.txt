justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought,
mr.
tribe,
that
you
made
that
point
to
underscore
that
issue
preclusion
has
no
part
in
this
case
at
all,
because
nothing
was
ever
actually
litigated.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
would
you
distinguish
what
the...
we're
told
by
your
colleague
that
this
is
just
an
incidental
effect.
it's
like,
creditor
1
sues
debtor,
and
debtor,
paying
that
judgment,
wipes
out
debtor's
fortune.
creditor
2
comes
along,
just
as
good
a
case,
tough
luck.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
elwell
really
is
not
available,
then
couldn't
you,
on
behalf
of
the
bakers,
introduce
elwell's
testimony
from
the
georgia
case,
where
he
did
testify,
i
think
about
the
same
defect.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
tribe,
i
thought
when
you
were
concentrating
on
preclusion
principles
rather
than
a
due
process
personal
right
that
what
you
were
talking
about
is
one
state's
right
to
dictate
the
rules
of
admissibility
of
evidence
in
another
state,
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
is
about
relations
to
the...
between
the
states
in
the
national
union
more
than
it
is
about
personal
rights
of
individuals,
and
here
there's
a
question
of
the
allocation
of
authority
between
michigan--
--right.
--and
missouri.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
application
of
full
faith
and
credit
as
far
as
i
know,
in
all
the
history
of
that
clause,
this
court
has
never
even
said
that
full
faith
and
credit
is
owed
to
a
decree
ordering
a
person
to
do
an
act.
indeed,
wasn't
it
entirely
clear
under
the
regime
that
existed
until
the
thirties
under
the
first
restatement
of
conflicts
that
a
granting
or
denying...
and
i'm
reading
you
from
the
first
restatement
section
449...
granting
or
denying
equitable
relief
other
than
in
order
to
pay
money
is
a
matter
of
discretion,
and
the
decision
of
one
court
to
give
specific
relief
will
not
limit
another
court
and
thus
exclude
the
use
of
discretion
by
the
second
court.
that
was
talking
even
as
between
the
two
parties
to
the
first
judgment,
and
here
you're
saying,
oh,
but
we
can
enforce
an
order
to
act
not
only
as
to
the
party
who
was
ordered
to
act,
which
this
court
has
never
said
comes
within
full
faith
and
credit,
but
to...
against
a
stranger.
now,
that
is
really
asking
this
court
to
take
a
giant
step.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
give
me
one
citation
where
this
court
has
said
state
2
must
compel
x
to
do
an
act
simply
because
state
1
compelled
x
to
do
an
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
all
that
cole
v.
cunningham
said
was
that
state
1
can
issue
an
antisuit
injunction.
it
did
not
say
that
state
2
had
to
pay
that
injunction
any
mind.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
simply
asking
you,
has
there
ever
been
such
a
case
in
the
history
of
the
united
states...
custody
is
a
status,
child
custody.
those
decrees
are
modifiable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
am
not
aware...
i
am
aware
of
some,
as
you
no
doubt
know,
the
land
cases,
fall
v.
eastin,
klopp
v.
klopp
say
even
the
very
actor
that
was
told
to
convey
a
piece
of
property
in
state
1
doesn't
have
to
do
it
if
he's
in
state
2
and
that's
where
the
property
is.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it's
a
long
extension.
i'm
simply
making
the
point
that
you
are
asking
this
court
to
make
a
ruling
that
it
has
never
made.
you
may
be
right
that
it
should.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
may
be
right
that
the
restatement
was
wrong
and
that
those
cases
were
wrong,
but
it
is
something
very
novel
you're
asking
us
to
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cappuccio,
it
isn't
in
this
respect.
you
know,
you
gave
the
creditor
1,
creditor
2,
and
i
followed
that,
creditor
2
comes
too
late,
and
it's
just
an
incidental
effect.
but
here,
the
whole
purpose
of
this
injunction
was
to
control
litigation
not
in
michigan
but
elsewhere.
the
whole
purpose
was
to
say,
in
effect,
michigan
rules
the
world.
it
determines
what
evidence
will
be
admissible
in
courts
all
across
the
country,
although...
and
i
think
you'll
agree
with
me
that
to
this
extent
the
restatement
of
conflicts
is
right...
each
state
applies
its
own
rules
to
determine
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
so
here
is
michigan
in
effect
preempting
the
ordinary
operation
of
the
rules
of
evidence
of
all
the
courts
in
the
country--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
i've
never
seen
any
decree
quite
like
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cappuccio,
would
you
tell
me
how
michigan
has
the
power
to
drag
somebody
in
alaska,
in
hawaii,
and
say
you
can't...
plaintiff,
you
can't
choose
your
own
forum.
you
have
to
come
to
michigan
to
litigate.
the
scene
that
i
get
from
what
michigan...
what
you
are
attempting
to
extract
from
this
michigan
judgment
is
in
effect
michigan
rules
the
world,
like
the
old
story
about
tobago
rules
the
world,
only
now
it's
michigan
is
going
to
decide
what
evidence
comes
in
all
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
talking
about
the
party
to
it,
but
this
is
a
consent
decree.
the
parties
are
not
going
to
litigate
anything.
we're
talking
about
the
effect
in
another
forum
on
that
forum
and
the
normal
operation
of
its
courts,
and
someone
who
was
a
nonparty
and
can't
be
required
to
go
any
place.
i
asked
you...
i
started
out
asking
about
the
old
restatement,
and
you
corrected
me
by
saying
that's
flatly
wrong,
but
the
current
restatement
has
this
interpretation.
it's
entitled,
limitations
on
full
faith
and
credit,
not
about
due
process.
it
says,
a
judgment
rendered
in
one
state
need
not
be
recognized
or
enforced
in
a
sister
state
if
such
recognition
or
enforcement
is
not
required
by
the
national
policy
of
full
faith
and
credit
because
it
would
involve
an
improper
interference
with
important
interests
of
the
sister
state,
here
the
important
business
being
determining
for
itself
what
evidence
is
admissible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
can
quarrel
for
that
one
way
or
another,
and
i
can
say
to
you,
you
will
see
that
there
is
no
decision
of
this
court
saying
state
2
enforces
x
to
do
an
act
simply
because
state
1
did.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
may
be
right
that
we
should--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
that,
but
there...
i
could
say
there
is
no
authority
for
it
and
be
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
fauntleroy
was
a
question
of
a
judgment,
a
litigated
judgment,
and
a
determination
had
been
made,
and
then
in
state
2
a
party
to
that
judgment
wanted
to
look
behind
it,
and
that's
a
no-no,
and
that's
well-established.
here,
we're
not
talking
about
elwell.
we're
talking
about
bakers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cappuccio,
may
i
ask
in
reference--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
fauntleroy
v.
lum
there
was
a
later
decision
by
justice
stone...
was
it
pacific
employers
+/?
and
i'll
just
read
you
what
he
said
some
years
after
fauntleroy
v.
lum.
perhaps
he
was
wrong,
too.
it
has
often
been
recognized
by
this
court
that
there
are
some
limitations
upon
the
extent
to
which
a
state
may
be
required
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
to
enforce
even
the
judgment
of
another
state
in
contravention
of
its
own
policy.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
wasn't
in
a
dissenting
opinion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
this
sentence
was
about
judgments,
so
you
say
that
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--back.
back.
that's
a
very
revealing
word.
they
never
were
there
in
the
first
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
spoke...
in
your
brief,
you
spoke
about,
you
must
return
to
michigan,
and
now
twice
you
said
go
back
to
michigan.
michigan
has
no
power
over
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
michigan
can
rule
the
world
to
that
extent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
can
require
anybody
from
anyplace...
even
though
michigan
would
have
no
power
over
them,
by
having
a
judgment,
a
plaintiff
against
defendant,
third
party,
wherever
she
may
be,
will
have
to
go
to
that
one
place
to
litigate.
it
sounds
very
strange.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
suggesting
that
it
wouldn't
be,
just
between
those
two
parties,
perfectly
all
right
for
general
motors
to
say,
if
you
are
indeed
subpoenaed
by
somebody--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
you
can't
help
it,
but
don't
walk
into
a
place
that
would
otherwise
have
no
power
over
you.
