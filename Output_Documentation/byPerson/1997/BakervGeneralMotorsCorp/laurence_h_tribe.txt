mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
judge
in
michigan,
without
an
adversary
hearing,
enters
a
consent
decree
as
part
of
a
stipulated
monetary
settlement
between
g.m.
and
an
employee,
ron
elwell.
the
employee
can
give
testimony
about
g.m.'s
practices
that
it
considers
damaging
but
is
unable
to
suppress
in
the
usual
manner...
that
is,
by
persuading
a
judge
that
the
testimony
is
inadmissible
because
of
attorney-client
privilege,
trade
secrets,
and
the
like.
the
decree
permanently
enjoins
the
employee
from
being
deposed
or
testifying
without
the
consent
of
general
motors
as
a
witness
of
any
kind
in
state
or
federal
litigation
brought
against
g.m.
anywhere
by
anyone,
whether
a
private
plaintiff
seeking
damages
or
a
public
official
enforcing
health
and
safety
regulations
or
criminal
statutes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
what
i
mean,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
there
was
no
adversary
hearing
and
though
consent
decree
is
sometimes
used
to
refer
to
a
class
action,
here
it
was
a
stipulated
settlement
entered
on
the
record
by
the
judge
after--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--sure.
this
is
not...
we're
not
suggesting
that
there
was
anything
unique
or
unusual
about
it.
what's
unusual,
or
at
least
what
some
people
think
is
unusual,
is
that
the
request
for
a
subpoena
to
depose
the
employee
or
to
call
him
as
a
witness
comes
from
a
litigant
who
was
not
a
party
to
and
had
no
notice
of
the
little
proceeding
that
led
to
the
quite
usual
entry
of
the
decree.
now,
the
district--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
certainly
true--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
it
makes
it,
if
anything,
worse
that
they
didn't
have
notice.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
absolutely.
i
make
that
point
only
because
at
various
points
in
the
brief
by
general
motors
it's
suggested
that
there
were
some
elaborate
findings
that
this
was
the
only
possible
way
of
protecting
privilege.
our
position
would
be
the
same
anyway,
but
i
just
wanted
to
note
the
fact.
the
district--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that's
certainly
true,
justice
ginsburg--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--and
it's
in
addition
true
that
if
there
had
been
litigation,
it's
somewhat
ironic
that
a
determination
by
judge
hathaway
in
michigan
that,
for
example,
some
document
was
privileged
in
a
proceeding
between
general
motors
and
elwell
would
obviously
not
be
binding
against
the
bakers
here,
and
yet
the
intriguing
thing
is
that
this
decree,
the
injunction,
has
this
enormous
effect
on
them.
the
question
is,
does
it
matter
that
they
weren't
there?
the
district
court
thought
it
mattered
a
great
deal,
invoked
what
it
called
the
rights
of
third
parties...
at
page
28a--and
essentially
took
the
position
that
the
full--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
i'm
sorry,
the
district...
yes,
the
district
court
below,
in
missouri,
mr.
chief
justice...
took
the
position
that
the
full
faith
and
credit
statute
should
not
be
read
to
mean
that
a
decree
of
this
kind,
and
i
quote
him,
forever
defines
the
rights
of
innocent
third
parties
who
have
a
keen
interest
in
the
information
that
elwell
holds.
now,
the
eighth
circuit
disagreed,
took
the
position
that
the
whole
point
of
the
decree
was
to
dispose
of
what
it
called
these
discovery
rights
of
litigants,
and
to
do
so
in
all
of
the
other
lawsuits
that
the
michigan
judge
assumed
would
follow.
of
course,
if
the
eighth
circuit
is
right,
the
consequences
are
pretty
sweeping.
the
old
maxim
that
the
public
has
a
right
to
every
man's
evidence
will
need
a
footnote
saying,
unless
he
has
sold
his
silence--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--evidence
might
expose.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
plaintiffs
here
are
the
bakers.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
children.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
that's
one
way
of
putting
it.
if
that
were
the
only
issue,
then
i
think
this
court's
decision...
really
several
decisions.
crider
v.
zurich,
a
decision
of
this
court,
holds
that
a
local
venue
rule
like
the
one
michigan
has
saying
that
you've
got
to
go
to
the
original
issuing
court
in
order
to
make
a
change
in
a
decree
or
a
judgment
or
an
injunction,
because
that
denies
the
full
faith
and
credit
premise
of
the
equal
competence
of
the
courts
of
other
states
to
entertain
the
matter,
that
kind
of
venue
rule
is
not
entitled
to
full
faith
and
credit.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
certainly
right,
justice
kennedy,
and
in
fact--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
let
me
back
into
that,
justice
breyer.
i
certainly
don't
agree
that
that's
better,
and
i
also
don't
agree
that
it's
a
hopeless
clash
of
evils.
this
very
settlement
took
care
of
that.
there
was
a
side
agreement
that
said
that
if
he
is
ordered
to
testify,
then
he
cannot
be
sanctioned.
he,
indeed,
has
testified
against
g.m.
in
some
30
trials.
not
once--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
contempt
requires
a
certain
mens
rea,
and
that
in
that
case
he
cannot
be
held
in
contempt
for
following
the
order
of
a
court
that
appears
to
have
competent
jurisdiction--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
that's
certainly
right.
g.m.
has
to
be
before
the
missouri
court
to
create
the
problem.
in
this
case,
the
way
it
was
indeed
structured
was
with
a
side
agreement
that
eliminated
the
very
problem
that
the
court--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
but
i
do
think
first
there's
obviously
a
certain
wisdom
in
taking
these
one
case
at
a
time,
and
it
seems
to
me
very
clear
that
in
a
case
like
this,
where
it
is
just
wordplay
to
say
that
this
is
not
being
used
against
the
bakers,
that
they're
not
being
bound,
of
course
they
are.
they
are
being
deprived
of
the
procedures
that
would
otherwise
be
available
to
get
this
evidence,
and
the
only
thing
that's
being
invoked
to
deprive
them
of
it,
in
a
sense
a
legal
defense
to
their
claim,
is
the
michigan
judgment.
in
that
circumstance,
just
as
in--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
what--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
this
court
in
in
personam
as
opposed
to
in
rem
cases,
where
there
is,
in
fact,
a
finite
object
and
it
has
to
be
allocated,
and
once
it
is
you
can't
continually
relitigate
it,
has
never
held
that
we
can
simply
let
the
chips
fall
where
they
may
when
a
judgment
has
been
entered
not
over
an
object
but
over
knowledge
in
someone's
head,
a
judgment
that
says
we're
going
to
say
you
can't
testify
it.
that
is,
in
martin
v.
wilks
it
could
also
have
been
said
in
response
to
your
opinion
for
the
court
could
also
have
been
said,
well,
consent
decrees
often
have
side
effects
and,
indeed,
the
way
that
general
motors
tries
to
make
this
look
like
anything
other
than
an
easy
case
is
to
suggest
that
the
decree
is
only
being
enforced
against
mr.
elwell,
and
that
my
clients
are
simply
in
the
wrong
place
at
the
wrong
time,
the
way
their
mother
was
in
that
car.
now,
that,
i
think,
is
sheer
sophistry.
it's
not
true,
because
unlike
a
judgment
that
changes
something
physical,
it
reduces
the
assets
available,
it
eliminates
a
job,
this
judgment
has
effect
on
the
bakers
only
because
it
is
used
to
preclude
them
from
arguing
to
the
court
in
missouri
that
they
are
entitled
to
have
elwell's
testimony.
it
has
preclusive
effect.
it
involves
the
absentee
adjudication
of
their
rights.
that's
what
this
court
has
never
allowed.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right,
and
this,
justice
ginsburg,
is
nothing
like
that.
a
case
like
that
shows
that
a
judgment
can
be
for
some
people
a
natural
disaster.
the
landscape
has
changed
and
you
can't
reconstruct
it.
the
judgment
in
this
case
didn't
change
anything
physical.
it's
not,
for
example,
as
though
this
was
a
judgment
that
mr.
elwell
did
something
terrible
and
should
be
executed
in
the
state
of
michigan
which
would,
of
course,
render
him
unavailable.
the
only
way...
just...
you
have
to
ask
yourself,
i
think,
what
the
causal
chain
is.
their
argument
is,
so
what,
too
bad,
the
judgment
in
michigan
has
made
this
fellow
essentially
unavailable,
just
as
though
he
were
incarcerated.
but
of
course
then,
under
the
federal
rules,
one
could
at
least
depose
him.
the
fact
is,
if
you
ask,
what's
the
causal
chain
by
which
he
was
made
unavailable,
he's
unavailable
only
to
the
extent...
and
this
goes
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question...
that
general
motors'
request
to
the
judge
in
the
state
of
missouri
that
the
judgment
in
michigan
be
treated
as
preclusive
of
the
rights
of
the
litigants
in
missouri,
who
weren't
there,
weren't
represented,
weren't
privies,
had
no
notice,
it's
only
to
the
extent
that
that
request
is
granted.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
testimony
about
the
ivey
memorandum
was
particularly
helpful
here,
and
rather
damning,
i
think,
to
general
motors,
but
certainly
one
ought
not
to
be...
it's
really...
the
idea
that
there
are
second
best
solutions
all
build
on
the
wrong
premise,
that
you
can
bind
them
to
this
decree,
bind
in
a
strictly
technical,
legal
sense.
that
is,
justice
stevens,
for
example,
in
the
dissent
in
martin
v.
wilks
came
up
with
a
possible
way
that
a
consent
decree
in
a
case
like
that
might
be
used
against
the
other
side
without
really
binding
them.
that
is,
it
might
bear
on
the
state
of
mind
of
the
person
subject
to
the
decree.
it
might
help
the
employer
in
a
title
vii
case
negate
a
claim
of
bad
faith.
no
such
indirect
use
of
the
decree
is
involved
here.
the
decree
is
being
brought
to
bear
fully
on
the
only
people
who
are
hurt
by
it.
it's
not
being
enforced
against
mr.
elwell,
who's
never
sanctioned.
the
entire
structure
of
the
situation
is
that
general
motors
obtains
a
settlement
in
which
it
has
a
chance
to
argue
to
courts
around
the
country
you
ought
to
prevent
the
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
from
getting
this
evidence
that
they
could
otherwise
get,
to
which
they
would
be
entitled
under
the
federal
rules,
not
because
you
have
a
right
to
some
kind
of
evidence
in
the
abstract,
but
because
you
have
an
entitlement
to
use
the
rules
in
place.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
latter.
the
latter,
justice
kennedy.
that
is,
and
this
court's
precedents
make
clear
that
full
faith
and
credit
and
the
law
of
judgments
and
of
res
judicata
are
bound
up
historically
and
analytically,
and
the
only
reason
you
might
want
to
reach--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i...
there's
certainly
alternative
holding
in...
some
of
the
earlier
cases
before
the
1970's,
when
the
court
began
positivizing
procedural
due
process,
there
were
cases,
a
fair
number
of
them,
including
hansberry
v.
lee
and
others,
in
which
the
language
of
the
court
is
that
it
has
been
a
principle
since
time
immemorial
that
people
are
not
bound
by
judgments
in
proceedings
that
they
don't
have
a
chance
to
participate
in,
and
occasionally
the
phrase,
full
faith
and
credit,
has
entered
those
opinions.
but
that
has
been
axiomatic
throughout.
you
only
reach
procedural
due
process
if
you
think
that
congress
for
some
reason
in
section
1738
departed
from
that
normal
understanding
of
full
faith
and
credit
and
the
law
of
judgments,
in
which
case
we
argue
that
it
would
have
been
a
deprivation
of
property
in
the
form
of
an
entitlement
to
invoke
the
procedural
rules,
much
like
logan
v.
zimmerman,
without
due
process,
even
considering
justice
breyer's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--yes,
as
in--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
there
are
two.
there's
a
state-created
property,
justice
souter,
the
tort
cause
of
action,
and
a
second
state-created
property
interest
in
the
missouri-created
separate
cause
of
action
for
damages
for
aggravated
action.
it's
a
kind
of
punitive
damage--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
don't
have
any
desire
to
urge
the
court
to
enlarge
on
logan.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
with
respect
to
the
federally
created
entitlement
to
invoke
the
rules,
i
don't
think...
the
key
point
is,
we're
not
talking,
mr.
chief
justice,
about
some
takings
argument.
we're
only
talking
about
the
fact
that
when
the
rules
provide
a
clear
right
to
obtain
or
to
seek
to
obtain
a
subpoena
or
a
deposition,
then
that
is
enough
of
an
entitlement
so
that
it
would
not
be
constitutional
for
a
court
to
say
well,
we'll
decide
that
by
a
flip
of
a
coin.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
don't
think
one
has
to
choose--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
it
could
be...
it
could
be
either,
but
i--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
it
is
both.
it
would
have
to--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
certainly
has
to
be
one
of
the
three,
and
it's
not
life.
but
it
doesn't
really
in
this
case
have
to
be--
[laughter]
--any
of
the
three,
because
full
faith
and
credit
doesn't
extend
in
this
way,
doesn't
extend
in
this
way
to
judgments
that
were
rendered
in
a
proceeding
that
one
was
an
utter
stranger
to.
i
mean,
whatever
you
think
of
the
practical
problems
that
justice
breyer
was
discussing,
i
think
you
can
rule
out
as
one
of
the
possible
solutions
a
solution
that
says,
well,
the
grandmother
in
his
hypothetical,
or
the
children
in
mine,
will
simply
have
to
be
bound
by
a
judgment
in
another
jurisdiction.
that
can't
be
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
now,
if
you
say,
justice
breyer,
well,
i'm
not
saying
they're
bound,
i'm
just
saying
they
have
to
travel
to
michigan
to
seek
relief,
justice
brandeis
in
the
chase
national
bank
case
in
1934
essentially
was
addressing
that
problem
when
he
said
that
you
should
have
a
right
to
stay
at
home,
mind
your
business,
and
know
that
the
rights
won't
be
affected
by
a
judgment--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
a
district
court.
besides--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--what--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
breyer,
i
hate
to
disappoint
you,
but
i
have
not
found
anything
that
is
clear
enough
that
it
would
bear
on
an
injunction
remotely
like
this
one.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
effect--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
the
other
party
can
travel,
but
his...
i
don't
understand
why
general
motors,
given
its
vehicular
mobility--
[laughter]
--couldn't
just
go
back
to
michigan
and
ask
for
some
kind
of
relief.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
if
i
might,
justice
ginsburg,
simply
jump
to
that
for
a
moment,
because
it
seems
to
me
that's
a
very
important
feature
of
the
case
that
i'm
not
sure
is
as
thoroughly
explicated
in
the
briefs
as
it
might
be,
and
that
is
the
following.
set
aside
for
the
moment
the
question
of
whether
under
normal
principles
of
preclusion
these
children
who
were
strangers
to
the
proceeding
could
be
bound.
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
no.
secondly,
i
think
it's
clear
they're
being
bound.
but
the
point
you
make
is
the
one
that
intrigues
me
most
in
a
way,
and
that
is,
the
whole
premise
of
full
faith
and
credit
in
a
federal
union
like
ours
is
a
premise
of
mutual
respect,
the
premise
that
says
a
state
is
not
to
assume
that
the
courts
of
another
state
just
can't
do
justice
as
well
as
its
courts
can
and,
indeed,
that
premise
pervades
our
system.
the
anti-injunction
act
and
the
younger
doctrine
means
the
federal
courts
can't
presume
inadequacy
on
the
part
of
the
state
courts,
and
this
court's
decisions
in
donovan
v.
dallas
and
general
atomic
indicate,
too,
that
a
state
court
cannot
tell
litigants,
even
litigants
in
its
courts,
that
they
may
not
invoke
certain
procedures
in
a
federal
court.
in
general
atomic
it
wasn't
even
an
antisuit
injunction.
they
were
being
told
that
they
could
not
use
rule
14
as
an
impleader.
this
case
is
a
classic
example
of
that.
essentially,
if
the
eighth
circuit's
use
of
the
decree
from
michigan
is
affirmed,
it
will
follow
that
the
courts
of
a
state
can
not
only
make
decisions
that
will
have
res
judicata
and
preclusive
and
sometimes
collateral
estoppel
effect
substantively
in
the
courts
of
another
state,
it
will
follow
that
the
courts
of
a
state
can
control
who
can
be
called
as
a
witness,
who
can
be
deposed,
what
evidence
can
be
introduced
in
another
state
or
in
the
federal
courts.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
impermissible.
i
mean,
decisions--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
missouri,
justice
o'connor--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
missouri
is
being
told
that
it's--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--but
if
it's
privileged
because
of
some
background
rule
like
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
that's
one
thing,
but
if
a
state
can
create
this
kind
of
special
witness
protection
program
under
which
it
can
decide
which
witnesses
it
would
be
utterly
futile
to
call
in
the
courts
of...
in
the
federal
courts
despite
their
own
independent
interest
in
the
administration
of
justice,
that
would
be
an
interpenetration--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there
are
several
cases,
justice
o'connor,
in
which
judges
have
washed
their
hands
of
it
and
have
said,
under
our
venue
rules
go
to
judge
hathaway.
even
though
it
was
the
same
court
in
michigan,
they
treated
the
venue
rule
as
a
kind
of
rule
of
personality,
and
judge
hathaway
apparently
has
sort
of
washed
his
hands
of
it
and
has
said,
i
put
the
injunction
in
place,
so
that
it
appears
to
be--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
answer
is
yes.
i
think
it
probably
means
that,
but
it's
ambiguous,
and
the
record
doesn't
resolve
the
ambiguity.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
dispute
that
the
michigan
court
has
the
power
to
enter
an
order
that
directly
tells
someone
to
defy
the
order
of
another
jurisdiction--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
that's
right
as
well.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
we
make
it
indirectly
in
the
point
that
i
was
elaborating
to
justice
ginsburg.
that
is,
if
it
is
true
that
the
courts
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
various
states
are
not
authorized
to
put
people
in
this
circumstance
and
in
effect
to
make
inroads
in
the
internal
operation
of
the
systems
of
other
states
and
of
the
federal
government,
then
this
order
is
completely
void
independent
of
the
nonparty
status
of
the
bakers.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
it's
not
quite
as
big
as
that,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
as
in
prince
and
in
new
york
this
is
a
case
that's...
that
i
think,
though,
there
are
much
easier
ways
to
decide
it.
under
normal
principles
of
judgments,
i
think
it's
possible
to
say--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--that
the
internal
operations
of
the
judicial
systems
of
each
state
cannot
be
manipulated
or
commandeered
by
the
judgments
of
other
states,
but
i
don't
myself
suggest
that
a
case
that
can
be
disposed
of
as
simply
as
this
one
because
of
the
bakers'
nonparty
status
should
be
the
vehicle
either
for
exploring
the
puzzles
that
justice
breyer
raises
or
for
adopting
this
add-on
to
prince.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
as
between
elwell
and
g.m.,
yes,
although
the
bakers
or
others
like
them
are
not
bound
by
that
determination
under
standard
principles
of
preclusion.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it
depends
whether
there
is
a
nonparty
whom
one
is
seeking
to
bind.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think,
justice
souter,
yes,
and
that's
what
the
eighth
circuit
is
basically
telling
the
courts
of
missouri
to
do.
i
think
i
perhaps
should
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
begin
by
saying
that
the
power
of
congress
in
response
to
martin
v.
wilks
to
have
a
national
venue
provision
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
power
of
a
state
to
say,
come
back
to
michigan
though
you've
never
been
here.
congress
was
not
acting
in
connection
with
full
faith
and
credit.
what
congress
was
doing
was
exactly
analogous
to
michigan's
in-state
rule
saying
venue
is
in
the
court
that
did
it
in
the
first
place.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
no.
justice
scalia,
if
third
parties
are
effectively
bound,
that's
my
problem.
i'm
not
saying
that
general
motors
could
not
have
arranged
to
have
sanctions
imposed
on
him
as
he
travels
around
the
country
if
he
testifies
in
response
to
the...
in
response
to
orders.
that
would
be
a
matter
of
contract
between
general
motors
and
this
employee.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
i
think
not,
justice
scalia.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
in
all
likelihood,
though--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--the
principle
is
that
as
a
matter
of
due
process
one
cannot
be
held
in
contempt
for
refusing
to
comply
with
the
order
of
a
court.
one
can--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--you
can
waive
your
right,
certainly
justice
souter.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
oh,
yes,
that's...
sure.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
then
there's
no--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--then
there's
no
problem.
of
course--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--there's
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
what...
of
that.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
the
briefs
in
opposition
don't
even
suggest
it.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
yes.
i
would
think
if
you
have
such
a
case
he
could
be
in
contempt.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
opposition
to
cert
didn't
suggest
this
was
such
a
case.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
right,
and
i'm
afraid
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
