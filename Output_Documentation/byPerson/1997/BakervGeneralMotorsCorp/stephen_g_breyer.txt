stephen
g.
breyer
--what
has
surprised
me
in
this...
maybe
you
can
just
suggest
something
i
could
read.
it
seems
to
me
in
200
years
of
history,
it
must
have
come
up
before
that
state
a
enters
an
injunction
against
smith,
and
a
person
in
a
different
state
who
wasn't
a
party
and
isn't
bound
would
either
have
to
go
to
the
first
state
to
get
it
modified
or
could
sue
in
his
own
state
and
would
discover
that
that
person
whom
the
injunction
was
aimed
at
could
be
made
subject
to
conflicting
injunctive
orders.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
amazed
that
there
isn't
something
written
that's
absolutely
clear,
explaining--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
it's
either
the
one
way
or
the
other
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
you
see,
maybe
your
injunction
is
not
like
what
i'm
saying,
but
what's
bothering
me
is
the
instance
that
i'm
saying--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--other
injunctions,
so
is
there
something
you
can
point
me
to
that
would
say
why
it's
better
to
have
the
possibility
of
conflicting
injunctions
than
to
require
the
plaintiff
to
travel
to
the
state
where
he's
not
bound
and
get
the
modification.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
is
the
authority
for
that?
that
is...
let
me
go
through
exactly
the
same
question
i
asked
professor
tribe.
in
justice
o'connor's
case
you
have
a
third
person
who
was
not
party
to
the
first
action
who
wants
the
services
of
the
employee.
we
agree
that
that
third
person
is
not
bound,
and
you
agree
that
the
bakers
here
are
not
bound.
moreover,
if
the
bakers
have
a
claim
to
this
evidence,
and
it
sounds
as
if
they
do,
there's
no
doubt
they
get
it.
they
will
get
this
evidence.
only
question
is
whether
they
have
to
go
back
to
michigan.
well,
similarly,
what's
the
authority?
in
200
years,
there's
never
been
a
case
that
says
that
either
this
employer
in
the
second
state,
i.e.,
the
third
party,
that
says
either,
of
course
the
second
state
has
to
follow
the
injunction
of
the
first
against
the
employee,
not
the
employer,
so
go
to
the
first
state,
get
it
modified,
or
that
says
the
opposite,
and
there's
never
been
a
law
review
article
that
explores
that
question
deeply?
i
mean,
what
i'm
looking
for
is
the
case
or
the
law
review
article
in
200
years
that
went
into
what
i
would
think
was
the
most
simple
basic
question
under
injunctions
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
is--
