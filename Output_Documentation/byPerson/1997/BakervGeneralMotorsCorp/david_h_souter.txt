justice
david
h.
souter
--i
take
it
your
position
would
be
the
same
if
there
had
been
an
adversarial
proceeding
and...
which
had
resulted
in--
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
is
that?
isn't
the
issue
just
whether
the
baker...
what's
the...
the
plaintiff--
justice
david
h.
souter
--would
have
to
go
to
michigan
and
say,
we're
not
bound
by
the
michigan
decree.
of
course
they're
not
bound
by
it.
so
they'd
go
to
michigan
and
they'd
say,
look,
we've
never
litigated
this,
and
therefore
will
you
please
modify
the
decree
because,
after
all,
we
don't
want
to
ask
him
about
any
privileged
information.
we
don't
want
to
ask
him
about
any
confidential
information.
we
want
information
that
we
have
a
right
to.
your
decree
is
too
broad,
so
modify
it.
we
were
never
parties.
and
they'd
be
totally
right
in
that,
wouldn't
they?
so
the
issue
is
just
what
court
they
have
to
go
to.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
precisely
the
issue,
because...
you
might
come
to
this
when
you
want,
but
what's
worrying
me
is,
if
you
require
the
bakers
to
go
to
michigan
you
run
into
the
problem
that
justice
kennedy
raised.
why
should
they
have
to
go
to
michigan?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
but
if
you
don't
require
them
to
go
to
michigan,
you
run
into
the
possibility
that
elwell,
the
elwells
of
the
world,
i.e.,
those
under
injunctions,
will
get
under
conflicting
injunctions,
and
then
they'll
really
be
in
a
mess
because
in...
you
know,
you
have
one
state
telling
them
you
have
to
do
a
thing
and
another
state
saying
you
can't
do
a
thing--
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
that
would
produce
a
terrible
practical
mess,
so
between
those
two
evils,
it
seems
better
to
send
them
to
michigan.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
i'm
actually
worried
is
not
this
case.
i'm
worried
about
custody
cases,
antitrust
cases,
dozens
of
cases
in
which
very
complicated
injunctive
decrees
could
have
been
entered
against
defendants
in
state
1,
and
then
grandma
in
florida
in
a
custody
case,
or
any
supplier
in
an
antitrust
case
produces
a
different
action
in
florida
and
puts
alcoa
or
swift
or
mummy
or
daddy
or
somebody
under
a
conflicting
injunctive
decree,
and
that's
what
i'm
worried
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
the
property
was
your
cause
of
action,
which--
justice
david
h.
souter
the
only
point
at
which
the
one
state
is
commandeering
the
process
of
the
other,
i
take
it,
is
the
point
at
which
the
second
state
simply
will
not
hear
the
third
party.
the
state...
the
second
state
says,
i
don't
care
what
you
tell
me,
there
is
a
decree,
full
faith
and
credit,
that's
the
end
of
the
issue.
that's
the
point
at
which
it
commandeers,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
propose
a
variant
on
justice
stevens'
question?
let's
assume
we're
simply
talking
about
proceedings
in
michigan.
as
i
understand
your
characterization
of
what
the
michigan
court
has
already
said,
it
is
that
it
may
bind
a...
an
individual
who
was
not
party
to
the
original
litigation
between
elwell
and
g.m.
as
to
the
opportunity
of
that
third
party
to
seek
the
normal
process
of
any
michigan
court.
as
i
understand
it,
you
are
saying
that
michigan
says,
no,
you
may
not,
third
party,
now
a
plaintiff
in
a
new
case
against
g.m.,
go
into
the
normal,
whatever
would
be
the
normal
venue
in
michigan
and
say,
i
want
this
evidence.
you
are
bound
by
an
earlier
decree
to
which
you
were
not
party
to
come
into
a
different
court
and
raise
a
different
issue,
which
is,
should
i
be
bound
by
a
decree
between
these
two
other
individuals?
isn't
that
the
predicate
for
a
due
process
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
real
third
parties.
justice
david
h.
souter
people
who
were
not
in
fact
substantially
represented
the
first
time.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
could
be
held
in
contempt
if
he
acquiesced,
couldn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
if
he--
--if
he's
not
subpoenaed.
if
he
voluntarily
testifies--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
if
his
objection
is
a
sham--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then,
of
course
they
can
go
after--
