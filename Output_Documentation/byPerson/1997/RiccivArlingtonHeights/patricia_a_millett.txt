ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
breyer,
you
asked
for
examples
of
criminal
fine-only
offenses,
and
we
list
a
number
of
these
on
page
20
of
our
brief
which
are,
of
course,
federal
ones,
and
this
is
just
the
tip
of
the
iceberg.
this
is
not
an
exhaustive
list,
but
they
include
such
things
as
exclusion
of
jurors
on
account
of
race,
interference
with
aids
to
navigation,
vandalism
at
national
monuments
and
military
parks,
and
as
i
said,
this
is
the
tip
of
the
icebergs.
our
initial
cut
at
how
many
federal
fine-only
criminal
offenses
there
are
was
around...
i
think
i
got
around
60
to
70,
and
i
don't
know
if
that's
exhaustive.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
certainly
a
legislative
decision,
the
community
judgment
to
label
behavior
criminal,
is
a
big
factor
in
whether
it's
a
crime
or
not,
but
certainly
then
whether
traditional
criminal
processes
attend
the
prosecution
of
the
case.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
oh,
i
think
this
court
has
long
recognized
that
it
is
primarily
the
job
of
states
and
congress
within
its
authority
to
define
what
is
criminal
or
not,
whether
or
not
this
court
or
one
particular
jurisdiction
thinks
that's
a
wise
thing
to
make
criminal
or
not,
and
if--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
don't
know
if
we
have
a
position
on
what
happens
to
ordinance
in
particular.
i
think
our
position
is
very
clear
that
there
is
no--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--plenty
of
civil
offenses
that
are
not
criminal,
and--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--our
position--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--our
position
is
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
draw
a
bright
line
banning
seizures,
arrests,
for
civil
offenses,
such
things
as
deportation,
extradition,
civil
commitment,
if
a
police
officer
finds
someone
who
is
a
danger
to
himself.
there
are
categories
of
violations,
offenses...
i'm
not
even
sure
what
to
call
them...
civil
violations
for
which
arrest
has
traditionally
been
recognized
to
be
appropriate.
i
mean--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--conveyances
and
traffic
may
be
another
one.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right,
and
i
think
the
analysis...
the
mode
of
analyzing
whether
proceeding
without
a
warrant
or
whatever
process
would
be
appropriate
may
be
different
between
criminal
and
civil
cases
under
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
yes,
they
did,
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
but
for
purposes
of
what
would
be
required
in
the
civil
arena,
our
position
is,
if
it's
a
crime,
probable
cause
justifies
an
arrest.
you
know,
probable
cause
plus.
if
it's
civil,
i
think
this
court
has
recognized
that
under
the
fourth
amendment
when
you
get
into
civil
seizures,
which
take
a
variety
of
forms,
that
a
balancing
analysis
is
generally
appropriate,
and
of
course
we
want
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that's
right,
so
that's
why--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
guess
i'm...
if
you're
assuming
that
this
is
a
criminal
offense,
then...
i'm
sorry,
civil?
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
okay.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right.
i
think
a
balancing
would
be
appropriate
in
a
civil
case,
and
certainly
whether
or
not
someone
is
likely
to
abscond
or...
i'm
not
sure
someone
who's
a
danger
to
himself
is
the
same
as
a
likelihood
of
absconding,
but
that
could
be
another
factor.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
about
to
commit
suicide
or
other
civil...
just
to
harm
themselves,
if
not
suicide,
but
there's
going
to
be
a
balance--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
it
may
be
fair
for
a
legislature
to...
for
a
legislature
or
a
police
department
to
conclude
that
as
a
class
there
is
a...
and
the
fourth
amendment
analysis
may
permit
this,
that
there
is
as
a
class
a
risk
of
absconding
or
injury.
for
example,
when
we
think...
it's
harder
to
conceive
of
it
in
this
particular
case
in
the
established
business,
but
you'd
think
of
push-carts
and
vendors
along
the
street
who
are
operating
without
licenses,
and
whether
in
a
particular
case
i
know
this
person,
i
know
where
they
live,
i
don't
know
whether
i
would
be
able
to
find
them
again,
is
not
the
appropriate
analysis.
this
court
has
recognized
that
at
some
points
when
you
have
an
established
level
of
suspicion
you
need
not
have--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no,
certainly
not
for
crimes.
the
question
is
whether,
once
it's
a
civil
violation,
robinson
wouldn't
cover
that
by
its
own
terms.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
that
dealt
with
a
crime.
i
mean,
it
does
get
complicated
because
you
can
have
traffic
violations
that
are
a
crime
in
one
case...
maryland
v.
wilson
dealt
with
speeding,
where
it's
a
crime.
it
is
not
a
civil
infraction.
whren
v.
united
states
was
speeding
and
it
was
a
civil
infraction.
so
it...
jurisdiction
by
jurisdiction
the
same
conduct
may,
in
fact,
be
either
a
crime
or
a
civil
offense,
and
i
think
again
when
it's...
robinson
wouldn't
cover
it
if
it's...
necessarily
if
it's
civil,
but
there
may
be
either...
either
through
a
balancing
analysis
or
a
recognition
of
historical
categories
such
as
conveyances,
deportation,
immigration
control,
that
they
may
be
the
types
of
civil
seizures
that
are
permitted
on
a...
you
know,
without
balancing
in
individual
cases
because
of...
the
interests
are
going
to
apply
generally
across
the
board
in
making
a
seizure
in
those
cases
to
enforce
the
civil
or
criminal
law,
but--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes,
we
did,
and
i
apologize
if
we
don't
have
a
completely
thorough
analysis
of
the
issue.
we
did
not
read
the
second
question
presented
to
render
the
first
question
presented
an
advisory
question,
but
we
certainly
are
emphatic
that
there
is
not
a
bright
civil-criminal
line
in
the
fourth
amendment,
that
there
are
classes
of
seizures,
and
whether...
that
are
permissible
in
the
civil
arena,
as
i
said,
deportation,
conveyances,
or
the
maritime,
or
traffic,
and
whether
those--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
guess
it
depends
on
whether
this
court
reads
the
second
question
presented
differently
from
whether
we
did.
i
think
it
certainly
has
not
been
briefed,
briefed
other
than
at
a
very
late
stage,
and
it
wasn't
addressed
by
the
courts
below.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
if
this
court
concludes
that
it
is
civil
and
it
needs
to
address
it,
then
we
think
it
would
be
better
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--we
think
that
it
may
be
preferable
for
this
court
to
remand
to
allow
a
case
to
come
up,
or
else
the
courts
below
to
address
what
either
the
common
law
or
the
practices
are
for
civil
arrests
on
these
types
of
ordinances,
which
hasn't
been
briefed
and
addressed
below,
and
we
certainly
would
be
very
concerned
about
having
a
decision
issued
without
the
information
provided
to
this
court
that
is
necessary
about
civil
offenses.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
the
court
could
certainly
dismiss
cert
as
improvidently
granted
simply
on
the
question
that
either--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--our
position
is,
we
read
the
second
question
presented
in
light
of
the
first
question
presented.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
right,
absolutely.
absolutely.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if...
the
court--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--that
is
the
danger
that
you're
essentially
issuing
an
advisory
opinion
in
a
case
that
just
does
not
present
the
question.
that's
again
why
cert
may
have--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
think
you
were
not--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--our
only
position...
may
i
answer,
mr.--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--our
only
position
is
that
if
the
court
wishes
to
address,
or...
wishes
to
address
the
issue
and
wishes
not
to
address
the
criminal
issue,
that
it
may...
it's
certainly
within
this
court's
prerogative
to
decide
that
the
question
it
thought
it
was
going
to
be
deciding
is
not,
in
fact,
now
presented
to
the
case
in
light
of
the
respondent's
admissions.
