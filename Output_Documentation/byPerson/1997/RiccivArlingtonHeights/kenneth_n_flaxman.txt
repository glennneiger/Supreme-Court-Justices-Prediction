mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
was
arrested
because
he
was
operating
a
business
without
having
first
obtained
a
license
from
the
respondent.
respondent's
policy
required
its
police
officers
to
make
a
full
custodial
arrest
of
petitioner.
although
we
challenge
the
mandatory
nature
of
respondent's
policy,
our
primary
contention
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
permit
a
full
custodial
arrest
for
a
fine-only
infraction
on
the
same
basis
as
in
felony
cases.
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--what
i
mean
is
what
is
what
the
court
said
in
gustafson
v.
florida,
that
a
full
custodial
arrest
is
when
you're
taken
into
custody,
when
you
can
be
subjected
to
an
inventory
search,
when
the
area
around
you
can
be
searched,
when
you're
subject
to
up
to
48
hours
of
post-arrest
processing.
in
this
case
the
arrest
was
not
as
severe
as
it
could
have
been,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
engaged
in
balancing
the
severity
of
an
arrest.
an
arrest
is
an
arrest
is
an
arrest.
the
court
has
never
made
distinctions
between
them.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
in--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
in
the
most
recent
case--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
that's
temporary
questioning.
in
whren
the
court
was
very
careful,
i
think,
not
to
say
that
mr.
whren
was
being
arrested.
the
court
said
mr.
whren
was
being
subject
to
a
temporary
stop
for
questioning,
and
during
that
questioning
evidence
was
found.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
yes.
i
think
the
nightwalker
statutes,
allowing
detention
of
suspicious
people,
is
the
detention
for
investigation
that
is...
survives
today
in
terry
v.
ohio,
but
the
common
law
i
think
was
very,
very
clear
that
an
arrest
as
the
way
of
initiating
a
prosecution
was
reserved
for
felony
cases
or
for
nonfelony
cases
where
there
was
breach
of
the
peace
committed
in
the
officer's
presence.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
it
was
not
an
arrest
provision.
it
was
a
detention
provision,
an
investigative
stop
provision.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
oh,
if...
yes.
if--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
no.
if
a
person
refuses
to
accept
a
field
citation,
or
flouts
the
officer's
authority,
or
continues
to
jaywalk,
or
continues
to
litter,
or
continues
to
deface
public
property--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
not
an
arrest.
he
has...
that's
a
detention
for
giving
him
the
citation,
and
in
the
situation
where
the
person
refuses
to
cooperate
with
the
officer
who's
writing
the
citation,
then
the
person
traditionally
has
been
subject
to
arrest
for
not
cooperating
with
the
officer.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
the
court
has
differentiated
between
seizures
which
are
arrests
and
seizures
which
are
temporary
detentions
for
investigation
like
of
luggage,
or
of--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--like
of
luggage,
or
a
stop
of
a
person
for
questioning
at
the
scene
of
a
motor
vehicle
incident.
getting
back
to
whren,
the
court
was
not
there
talking
about
a
full
custodial
arrest.
the
court
was
talking
about
a
detention,
a
stop
to
investigate,
which
is
not--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
whren
was
not
an
arrest,
is
what
our
point
is.
whren
did
not
rise
to
that
level.
whren
was
a
detention
for--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it
talks
about
unreasonable
seizures
of
people.
when
somebody
is
arrested
they're
taken
into
custody.
they're
subject
to
all
of
the
post-arrest
processing
that
the
court
has
approved.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
when
somebody's
taken
to
the
police
station
the
court
has
uniformly
held
that
that's
an
arrest
situation.
in
berkemer,
which
was
the
motorist
stop
with
miranda
warnings,
the
court
said
you're
not
entitled
to
miranda
warnings
when
you've
been
stopped
and
we're
investigating,
but
once
you're
in
custody,
you
are
entitled
to
miranda
warnings,
which
is
what
happened
to
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
he
wasn't
just
brought
to
city
hall
to
buy
a
license.
he
was
brought
and
locked
in
a
room,
and--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
correct,
and
we
don't
have--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
i--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
true,
but
once
you're
under
arrest
you
don't
stay
at
the
scene.
you're
taken
away
to
someplace
else
for
processing.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
if
mr.
ricci
was
free
to
leave,
then
he
would
not
have
been
under
arrest.
but
getting
back
to
the
bond
question,
the
court
of
appeals
discovered
that
aspect
of
what
they
believed
the
village's
policy
was
on
their
own.
the
village
had
never
urged
that
mr.
ricci
was
facing
more
than
a
potential
$500
fine.
the
officers
who
arrested
mr.
ricci
knew
that
what
was
going
to
happen
was
that
he
would
get
a
business
license
and,
in
fact,
we
know
that
the
license
was
secured
while
he
was
under
arrest
and
in
custody.
he
wasn't
facing
this
gigantic
fine.
he
was
facing
the
annoyance
and
the
humiliation
of
being
arrested,
but
he
wasn't
facing...
there
wasn't
the
realistic
expectation
that
he
was
facing
a
fine.
in
those
situations
where
there
is
a
realistic
expectation
that
someone
is
facing
a
huge
fine
and
might
not
come
to
court,
the
officer
should
get
a
warrant.
that's
a
tradition--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--we
would
not
be
challenging
the
municipality's
policy.
there
would
be
a
question...
i
don't
know
how
it
could
be
raised,
about
whether
a
judge
has
the
authority
to
issue
a
warrant,
but
i
think
traditionally
and
at
common
law
judges
could
issue
warrants
for
minor
offenses.
we
have
that
in
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--there's
no
question
there
are
illinois
cases
approving
the
obtaining
of
warrants
to
make
arrests
for
minor
offenses,
and--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
but
in
order
to
get
a
warrant
in
illinois
the
officer,
whoever
applied
for
a
warrant
has
to
make
a
showing
not
only
that
there's
a
violation
of
the
law
but
that
the
person
will
not
obey
a
summons,
or
will
not
obey
a
citation.
there's
some
likelihood
that
the
person
will
flee
unless
they're
arrested.
and
that's
absolutely
not
present
in
this
case,
where
the
officers
knew
for
2
days
that
mr.
ricci
was
operating
his
business
and
that
he
appeared
not
to
have
a
license.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no.
i
think
that
would
be
consistent
with
the
common
law
history
of
specific
warrants
for
specific
offenses,
even
for
minor
offenses.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
i
think
a
judge
looking
at
a
warrant
application
in
this
case
would
say,
why
do
you
want
to
arrest
this
man,
give
him...
issue
a
summons.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
oh,
he
doesn't
have
to
say
that,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
i
think
the
court
has
traditionally
respected
the
warrant
as
legitimizing
a
seizure.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
there's
no
disagreement
in
this
case
that
there
was
probable
cause
to
believe
that
mr.
ricci
did
not
have
a
business
license.
the
question
is
whether
the
officers
without
a
warrant--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
exactly
the
position
that
we're
advocating
here,
but
that
is
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
and
that's
not
what
some
of
the
state
courts
have
said,
that
if
there's
any
kind
of
violation
then
police
officers
without
a
warrant
can
go
and
arrest
someone
for
littering.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
a
misdemeanor
is
an
offense
punishable
by
incarceration.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
every
state
has
a
different
definition
of--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--i
think
it's
clear...
it's
easy
to
look
at
the
statutes
in
any
state
and
determine
what's
a
fine-only
infraction.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
but
then
the
question
which
has
been
addressed
in
a
number
of
courts
is
whether
a
fine-only
infraction
is
a
crime
or
if
it's
a
civil
infraction.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
absolutely.
it--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it's
something
that's
punishable
by
fine
only,
which
is
not
even
the
level
of--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--unless
the
infraction
is...
involves
a
breach
of
the
peace,
or
there's
some
emergency.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
it's
not
fine
only
then
our
rule
doesn't
apply.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
oh,
i
think
it
will
do
it.
i
think
things
that
are
fine
only
are
really,
really
trivial.
i
think
if
we
look
at...
the...
i
mean,
the
court
has
done
that
with
the
right
to
trial
by
jury
with
petty
offenses.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
it
meant
a
disturbance
to
public
order,
that
there
was
some...
some
need
to...
that
the
arrest
was
necessary
to
preserve
order.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
in--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it
mean--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it
meant
that
in
a
different
context.
as
it
was
consistently
applied
to
arrest
cases
in
the
common
law
cases,
a
breach
of
the
peace
meant
an
affray,
that
that
there
was
a
disorder,
an
actual
disorder
or
a
potential
for
a
future
disorder.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
it's--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
i
think
it's
hypothetically
possible
to
envision,
and
maybe
my
opponent
can,
a
fine-only
ordinance
which
involves
a
breach
of
the
peace
for
which
the
officer
should
be
able
to
arrest
where
there
is
no
misdemeanor
or
felony
but
it
involves
the
same
conduct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
reckless
driving
involves
a
breach
of
the
peace.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
because
it--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
reckless
driving
is
the
kind
of
misconduct
that
can
involve
more
than
one
person.
i
think
it
depends
on
what
kind
of
reckless
driving
we
have.
we
have
people
drag-racing.
that's
a
different
kind
of
reckless
driving,
or
somebody
who's
weaving
over
a
yellow
line.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that...
you
should
not
be
able
to
be
arrested
for--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--i
think
it's
still
unreasonable
to
make
an
arrest.
i
think
we
can't...
i
don't
think
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
municipality
to
detain
that
person
for
it
because
that
person
didn't
pay
the
parking
ticket.
i
think
that
would
just--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
parking...
then
the
car
can
be
seized
and
immobilized
until
he
pays
the
parking
ticket,
which
is
the
traditional
way
for
dealing
with
that
kind
of
infraction.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
if
there
is
no
line
drawn
and
police
officers
are
free
to
make
arrests
for
any
violation
that
they
observe,
then
we
have
gone
back,
i
believe,
to
giving
general
warrants
to
police
officers.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
the
general
warrant
would
authorize
the
officer
to
make
an
arrest
of
anybody
that
he
believed
had
violated
a
law,
which
is--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--but
i
think
the
general
warrant
also
involved
the
officers
having
some
belief
that
somebody
was
involved
with
the
wrongdoing,
the
subject
of
the
warrant.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
i
disagree
that
a
fine-only
offense
is
a
subtle
line-drawing,
but
i
think
that
the
value
of
limiting
the
ability
of
the
police
to
make
arrests
for
fine-only
infractions
that
do
not
involve
a
breach
of
the
peace
is
that
it
promotes
respect
for
the
law,
and
it
avoids
the
situations
where
police
are
using
their
powers
in
a
unfair
manner.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
even
if
your
law
clerk
went
to
do
that--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--i
think
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
ascertain
that,
and
that's
not
because
your
clerk
isn't--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no.
if...
that's
a
classic
exigent
circumstance,
but
again,
fitting
into
the
hypothetical--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no,
and
i
think
that
the
criteria
for
when
the
police
officer
should
be
allowed...
should
be
able
to
exercise
his
or
her
discretion
to
make
an
arrest
has
been
identified
by
the
ali
in
the
model
code,
so
you
can
set
out--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well...
no--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--what
i
really
want
the
court
to
say
is
that
the
policy
that
we
have
in
this
case
of
requiring
arrests
in
all
trivial
cases
is
unreasonable,
and
that
unless
there
is
a
regulation
or
a
statute
or
an
ordinance
which
limits
the
discretion
and
which
says,
this
is
how
you
may
use
your
discretion
to
make
arrests,
that
the
police
can't
have
the
roving
commission,
the
absolute
freedom
to
make
arrests
in
trivial
cases.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
if
they
had--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it
depends
on
what
the
policy
was.
if
they
had
chicago's
policy,
then
we
would
not
be
suing
the
municipality
for
its
policy.
the
question
would
be
whether
the
officer
misused
his
authority
for
some...
to
deny
equal
protection
for
some--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
we're
not
suing
independent.
we're
suing
because
of
what
happened.
mr.
ricci
was
arrested
because
of
a
municipal
policy.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no.
i...
that's
not
what
i'm
saying.
if
arlington
heights
had
the
chicago
policy
and
the
officers,
for
whatever
reason,
decided
to
arrest
mr.
ricci,
we
would
not
have
a
case
against
arlington
heights.
we
would
not
have
a
fourth
amendment
case
against
the
officers.
we
might
have
an
equal
protection
case
against
the
officers
if
they
arrested
him
for
an
impermissible
reason.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's...
arlington
heights
tells
us
that
their
policy
is,
these
minor
violations
have
to
be
arrested.
you
can't
give
a
field
citation.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--the
policy
is,
there's
an
exception
for
parking
violations,
and
i
don't
know
if
seat
belts
are
a
municipal
ordinance
violation
or
whether
it's
a
state
statute
violation.
i
don't
know
if
arlington
heights
has
tried
to
regulate
seat
belts,
but
arlington
heights
says--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--other
than
parking
tickets
and
some
other
park
violations
arlington
heights
says,
officers
must
make
arrests,
and
i
think
that's
why
the
officers
did
not
treat
mr.
ricci
to
the
full
48
hours
of
detention
that's
authorized
for
an
arrest,
because
they
realized
that
there
was
no
need
to
do
that,
but
they
had
to
make
the
arrest
and
bring
him
down
and
lock
him
up.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
he
gets
a
clear
preponderance.
he
has
under
the
state
constitution
a
right
to
trial
by
jury.
he
can't
get
his
costs
if
he
wins
on
appeal.
the
state
can
appeal.
excuse
me,
the
village
can
appeal
if
it
loses
after
trial.
there's
no
double
jeopardy.
it's
in
the
nature
of
a
fine.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that
is--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
i
think
the
framers
rejected
that
and
intended
to
put
barriers
between
the
people
and
the
police.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
well,
if
this
court
upholds
respondent's
policy,
it
would
not
be,
and
it
would
be
absolutely
permissible.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no.
if
this
court--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that's
an
entirely
different
question
than
what
we're
arguing
here.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i'm
not
sure
what
the
answer
is,
and
in
an
appropriate
case--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--the
distinction,
though,
is
that
when
the
state,
when
the
legislature
has
said
we're
going
to
lock
people
up
for
48
hours,
then
it's
the
elected
people,
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
who
are
saying
that.
in
this
case,
it's
the
police
department
that's
saying
that.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no,
the...
this--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--this
is
a
police
department
unwritten
practice,
which
is
the
custom
of
the
whole
village,
but
there's
no
ordinance
saying
to
do
this.
this
is
the
police
department.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
correct.
in
this--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
the
city's
policy--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--the
city
admitted
that
its
policy
was
as
the
police
department--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--it
was,
but
it
was
not
adopted
by
an
ordinance
by
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--oh,
it
absolutely
is
the
city's
policy.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
i
think
that's
what
finally
is
the
same
thing--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--excuse
me?
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--i
thought
that's
what
i
was
arguing,
and
i
had
envisioned
that
dimension
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
the
common
law
rule--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--the
common
law
rule
allowed
arrests
to
begin
civil
prosecutions
of
this
nature,
but
there
was
a
warrant
to
do
that.
there
wasn't--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--that
ques--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
the
question
was
phrased
in
an
a
fortiori
situation.
if
the
rule...
we
know
what
the
rule
was
in
misdemeanors.
at
common
law
there
was
no
rule
at
all
allowing
arrest
in
ordinance
violation
cases.
ordinance
violation
cases--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--oh--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--no.
it's
a--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--well,
i
raised
that
in
an
a
fortiori
way
of
doing
it,
that
if
it's
not
true
for
misdemeanor
cases,
certainly
it
shouldn't
be
true
for
anything
less
than
misdemeanor
cases.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
no,
you
shouldn't.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
because
that's
just
a
civil
infraction.
that
is
not
enough
to
justify
an
arrest.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
that's
not
a
crime.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
most
states
that
have
actually
considered
that--
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
--and
there's
a
recent
decision
from
hawaii
who
said
you
can
detain
someone
and
search
them
and
talk
to
them,
but
you
can't
arrest
them.
mr.
kenneth
n.
flaxman
thank
you.
