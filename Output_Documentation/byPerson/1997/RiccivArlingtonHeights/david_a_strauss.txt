mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--this
is
treated
by
illinois
law
as
a
civil
offense.
it's
not
subject
to
the
panoply
of
criminal
protections.
that
point,
however,
is
something
that
petitioner
never
raised
throughout
these
proceedings
until
the
reply
brief
in
this
court
after
an
amicus
raised
it,
so
that--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--in
a
sense,
justice
kennedy,
the
text
of
the
constitution
is
that
authority.
the
text
of
the
constitution
grants
legislators
an
immunity
from
arrest
which
is
phrased
in
a
way
that
leaves...
that
denies
immunity
in
criminal
cases,
so
the
immunity,
the
limit
of
legislative
immunity
in
the
constitution
applies
to
arrest
in
civil
cases,
and
this
court
has
so
held
on
at
least
two
occasions,
in
williamson
and
brewster.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
it
was
the
capias,
the
initiation
of
private
civil
proceedings
by
means
of
seizing
the...
seizing
the
defendant.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
right.
right,
but
as
far
as--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--there
was
a
writ,
justice
souter.
i'm
not
sure
what
showing
was
required.
but
my
real
point
is
that
a
hard
civil-criminal
line
can't
be
imported
into
the
fourth
amendment,
given
that
the...
as
far
as
when
are
arrests
allowed,
given
that
the
constitution
itself
quite
clearly
envisions
arrests
in
civil
cases.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
justice
souter,
just,
i
want
to
preserve
the
point
that
they
waived...
that
both
courts
below
found
that
they
waived
any
right--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--justice
breyer,
we've
litigated
the
case
throughout
on
your
assumption
that
this
is
a
crime,
and
that
the
civil
nature
of
this
offense
has
simply
not
been
a
part
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
in
their
reply
brief
in
this
court,
after
an
amicus
raised
it
in
the
opening
round
of
briefing.
so
far
as
i
am
aware
there's
no
reference
to
the
illinois
statutes--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--justice
ginsburg,
absolutely.
we
understand
it's
a
civil
offense.
our
position,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
if
officers
have
probable
cause
to
believe
that
someone
is
guilty
of
an
offense,
they
may
seize
him,
and
as
long
as
the
seizure
is
reasonable
in
manner
and
duration
the
fourth
amendment
is
satisfied.
where
they
process
the
arrest,
whether
they
process
it
on
the
scene,
process
it
in
a
patrol
car,
process
it
in
another
office,
or
process
it
at
the
station
house
is
not
a
fourth
amendment
question.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
test
in
the
county
of
riverside...
there's...
the
county
of
riverside
establishes
a
48-hour--as
i
read
it,
justice
scalia,
establishes
a
48-hour
presumption,
but
it's
quite
clear
that
that
doesn't
give
the
authorities
a
free
48
hours,
that
it's
still
open
to
the
arrestee
to
say,
after
an
hour,
in
this
case,
you've
done
everything
you
needed
to
do,
why
didn't
you
release
me,
which
is
what
would
have
happened
and
what
he
could
have
said
in
this
case
had
we
held
him
even
for
2
hours.
i
think
county
of
riverside
is
quite
clear
that
it's
a
presumption
only.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
at
some
point
the
conditions
become
so
onerous
as
to
be
unreasonable,
and
this
court
in
another
case...
i
think
it
was
bell
v.
wolfish...
used
the
example
of
putting
someone
in
shackles.
at
some
point--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
type
of
offense
i
think
can
enter
the
calculus
of
what
is
a
reasonable
manner
of
restraint.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
i
don't
know
that
the
court
has
ever...
has
ever
limited
the
manner
of
confinement
based
on
the
nature
of
the
offense.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
stevens,
as...
well,
as...
if
they'd...
i
should
just
say,
as
for
a
traffic
offense
under
illinois
law
they
would
have
had
to
accept
his
license.
they
could
not
have
arrested
him
for
a
traffic
offense
under
illinois
law.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
but...
i
understand.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
understand.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
stevens,
as
i
read
robinson
and
gustafson
they
settled
that
question
and
the
answer
is
yes.
now,
if
that
rule
is
too
harsh,
it's--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
robinson
and
belton
control
the
scope
of
search--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
this...
in
this
case
there's
no
evidence
there
was
a
search
incident
to
the
arrest,
even
a
pat-down.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
so
far
as
i
read
it,
that's
controlled
by
robinson
and
belton.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
of
the
person.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no.
that
would
be
belton.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if...
and--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--and
chimel.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
justice--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--justice
o'connor,
yes.
our
policy
applies...
first
of
all
applies
only
to
local
ordinances.
traffic
offenses
in
illinois
are
governed
by
state
law.
this
applies
only
to
local
ordinances.
it
does
not
apply
to
parking
violations,
even
when
those
are
local
ordinances,
so
those
are
not
in
the
picture.
the
policy
is
not
that
the
police
must
arrest
everyone
who
violates
a
local
ordinance.
they
have
the
ordinary
discretion
in
giving
someone
a
warning,
or
just
letting
him
go.
but
if
they
initiate
proceedings
against
the
person,
they
must
bring
the
person
to
the
station
house,
where
the
sergeant
on
duty
makes
the
decision
whether
this
person
is
to
be
bonded
out
or
is
to
be
released
on
his
recognizance.
what
arlington
heights
tells
its
officers
on
the
beat
is,
when
you
make
an
arrest,
you
don't
make
the
call
about
whether
this
person
just
gets
to
sign
a
citation
and
leave
or
must
post
bond.
that's
a
call
to
be
made
at
the
station
house.
you
bring
him
in,
where
we
will
process
him.
that's
the
nature
of
the
policy,
and
that's
why
he
was
brought
in
for
this
offense.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
justice
souter,
and
there's
testimony
to
that
effect
in
the
record.
the
point...
the
citations
is
the
way
we
enforce
the
policy.
the
officers
are
not
given
citation
books
where
they
can
write
a
citation
in
the
field.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
how
the
policy's
enforced,
but
the
reason
for
the
policy
is--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--justice
ginsburg,
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
i
think
the
choice
about
whether
to
proceed
by
citation,
which
i
agree
is
often
allowed
by
municipalities,
or
whether
to
proceed
in
this
way
i
think
has
to
be
left
to
local
circumstances.
we
happen
to
be
in
a
position
where
we
can
process
people
quickly
and
where,
for
whatever
reason,
we
want
these
decisions
not
to
be
made
by
officers
on
the
beat,
whether
it's
because
we
think
they'll
be
vulnerable
to
accusations
of
shakedowns
and
intimidation,
or
because
we
want
them
back
out
on
the
street
and
not
processing
applications,
or
for
whatever
reason,
and
we
can
process
them
quickly.
in
a
large
metropolitan
area,
where
there
are
many,
many
arrests,
the
policy
is
likely
to
be
a
different
one.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
rehnquist,
when
i
said
it
wasn't
raised,
what
i
meant
is
this.
at
no
point
until...
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
until
the
reply
brief,
did
petitioner
ever
even
mention
the
civil
nature
of
the
offense
or
cite
the
illinois
statutes
in
cases
that
established
that
it's
civil.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
violation
of
a
fine-only
license
ordinance,
it
seems
to
me
the
natural
reading
of
that
is
criminal,
but
my
real
point,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
not
so
much
about
what
the
question
can
be
read
to
include,
as
the
premise
on
which
the
case
has
been
litigated
throughout,
and
that
premise
has
undoubtedly,
i'm
certain
of
this,
been
that
this
was--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--yes,
i
do
take
that
position,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the...
my...
the
basis
for
my
position
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
cannot
be
read
to
draw
a
sharp
line
between
criminal
and
civil
arrests,
and
the
authority
for
that
is
the
court's
statement,
justice
brandeis'
statement
in
long
v.
ansell
that
civil
arrests
were
common
at
the
time
of
the
framing,
and
the
inclusion
in
the
constitution
of
an
immunity
that
applies
only
to
civil
arrests,
confirming
that,
in
fact,
civil
arrests
are
contemplated
by
the
constitution.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
justice
souter,
before
i
assent
to
or
disagree
with
that
proposition
i
think
neither
case
that
was
litigated
about
civil
rights--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--mm-hmm.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
justice
souter,
at
common
law
the
line
between
criminal
and
civil,
especially
when
you're
dealing
with
so-called
public
nuisances...
that
is,
civil
affronts
to
the
government
as
opposed
to
a
private
party...
was
a
very
indistinct
line.
it
was--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
our
argument,
justice
souter,
would
be
that
a
civil
offense
against
the
government--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--whether
there's--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--we
would
have
authority
for
the
proposition
that
certain
categories
of
offenses
that
we
believe
are
the
ancestors
of
civil
offenses
against
the
government
could
be
subject
to...
at
common
law
to...
on
occasion
to
warrantless
arrests.
i
think
we
have
authority
for
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
the
night-walking
category
of
offenses,
where
there
were
minor
nuisances
committed
that
by
certain
statutes
under
certain
circumstances
could
be
proceeded
against--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
it
was
like
a
terry
stop
except
it
explicitly
could
last
overnight,
and
in
that
sense
it
really
resembles
more
what
goes
on
with
the
rest
of
the
minor
offenses.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
this
was
an
arrest.
we
don't
quarrel
with
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
terry
establishes
that,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
in...
in
illinois,
any
municipalities
have
the
authority
to
make
their
fine-only
offenses
civil.
they
could,
in
some
jurisdictions--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
can't
cite
you
to
any
in--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
can't
cite
you
to
any
in
illinois.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
local
ordinances
that
provide
only
for
fines
are
treated
as
civil.
i
should
say
this
isn't...
this
is
in
large
measure
a
benefit
to
the
accused
as
well,
who
now
does
not
have
a
criminal
record
by
virtue...
would
not
have
a
criminal
record
by
virtue
of
being
found
to
have
committed
a
civil
infraction.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
the
answer
is
no,
justice
ginsburg,
to
the
extent
that
the
record
will
reflect
that
this
is
a
civil
offense,
and
if
he
is
asked,
have
you
ever
been
convicted,
he's
not...
he
was
not
convicted.
the
charges
were
dismissed.
but
had
he
been
convicted,
were
he
asked,
have
you
ever
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
he
could
say
no.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
would
have
to
say
yes.
he
was
arrested.
he
was
arrested
on
probable
cause.
we
had
a
right
to
arrest
him.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
he
has
an
arrest
record.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
now,
he
could
go...
explain
the
charges
were
dismissed.
the
charges
were
only
civil.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
ginsburg,
the
reason...
the
subjective
reason
these
officers
arrested
him
was
that
we
tell
our
officers,
you
don't
make
the
decision
whether
to
release
the
person
on
the
basis
of
a
citation
or
not,
you
bring
them
down.
that
was
all
the
officers
were
thinking.
they
weren't
thinking
about
the
size
of
the
infraction.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
were
i
called
upon
to
explain
objectively
why
this
was
reasonable,
one
of
the
factors
i
would
say
if
i
needed
to
say
it
was
the
one
you
just
mentioned,
that
in
fact
he'd
been,
by
his
own
admission,
operating
for
6
months
and
did
face
a
very
substantial
fine.
he
had
a
person
on
his
premises
who
was
subject
to
an
arrest
warrant,
and
various
other
circumstances.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no.
justice
scalia,
so
far
as
i
know,
if
there
is
probable
cause,
then
the
person
can
be
seized,
can
be
arrested,
and
whether
he
is...
where
he
is
taken
for
processing
i
think
can't
be
regulated
by
a
constitutional
rule.
there
are
just
too
many
variables,
too
many
factors
that
affect
that.
they
vary
from
jurisdiction
to
jurisdiction,
situation
to
situation,
and
even
the
ali
which
disapproved
of...
which
emphasized
the
need
for
citations,
suggested
a
code
and
then
said,
but
the
fact
is
we
really
can't
prescribe
guidelines
about
when
citations
are
needed
because
the
situations
are
just
too
variable.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
if
it's
a
stop,
then
it's
a
seizure.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
but
so
far
as
i
know,
terry--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--it
doesn't
require
probable
cause,
but
if
it's...
if
there's
no
probable
cause
the
stop
is
very
limited
in
duration
and
purpose.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no.
he
was
released
in
an
hour,
justice
breyer,
and
there's
no
claim
here
that
the
detention
went
beyond
the
amount
of
time
needed
to
process
the
necessary
papers.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
