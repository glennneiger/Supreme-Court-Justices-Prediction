unknown
speaker
mr.
flaxman,
what
do
you
mean
by
full
custodial
arrest?
this
man
was
not
handcuffed,
he
wasn't
fingerprinted,
he
wasn't
put
in
a
holding
cell.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
an
arrest
is
an
arrest
is
an
arrest,
your
proposition
that
the
commonlaw
traditionally
has
not
allowed
arrests
for
misdemeanors
is
patently
false.
we've
had
several
cases
up
here
involving
the
arrest
of
motorists.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
arrest
means
to
stop
the
person.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
a
seizure,
when
they
stop
a
car?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
your
case
do
you
think--
--you
appeal
to
the
common
law.
do
you
think
the
common
law
makes
that
distinction
between
a
seizure
that
is
an
arrest
in
the
technical
sense
that
you're
telling
us
and
the
seizure
that
is
not
an
arrest
in
that
technical
sense?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
the
nightwalker
statute
was
not
an
exception,
then,
to
the
misdemeanor--
unknown
speaker
--well,
in
your
case,
in
the
case
we
have
before
us,
suppose
the
police
officer
did
what
you
say
he
should
do
and
told
the
man,
now
you're
going
to
have
to
come
down
and
i'm
going
to
give
you
a
citation,
and
the
fellow
said,
i'm
not
interested,
and
started
to
walk
away.
could
the
officer
hold
him
long
enough
to
fill
out
the
citation?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
an
arrest
is
an
arrest
is
an
arrest.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
officer
stays
stop,
i'm
going
to
write
you
out
a
citation,
and
then
he
fumbles
with
his
book
and
so
forth.
isn't
that
an
arrest?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
address
arrest.
it
addresses
seizures,
and
both
of
them
are
seizures.
unknown
speaker
like
a
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
but
i
thought
you
replied
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
a
few
minutes
ago
that
the
court
has
never
distinguished
between
kinds
of
arrests,
and
now
you're
distinguishing
between
them.
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
what
is
the
significance
of
the
term
arrest
in
fourth
amendment
connotation?
as
justice
scalia
says,
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
talk
about
arrest.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
how
do
you
know
that
they're
subject
to
all
the
post-arrest
processing.
how
do
you
know
they're
not
simply
subject
to
what
they
were
in
fact
subjected
to?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
distinction
you're
making
is
the
distinction
between
simply
stopping
and
keeping
someone
basically
in
the
vicinity
of
the
stop,
and
on
the
other
hand
taking
the
person
away,
as
to
the
police
station.
is
that
where
you
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
taking
them
into
custody,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
you'd
say
if
the
officer
told
the
person,
you
are
under
arrest,
you'd
say
that
that
was
an
arrest
even
if--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
the
door
weren't
locked.
suppose
the
police
said,
we
want
a
bond
because
the
liability
here
could
run
into
several
thousands,
considering
how
long
you
operated
without
a
license,
so
we're
going
to
take
you
in
because
we
have
no
facilities
to
arrange
for
the
bond
in
your
workplace,
and
we'll
put
you
in
a
waiting
room
and
we'll
see
where
you
are
but
we
won't
lock
the
door.
unknown
speaker
if
in
this
case
the
officer
had
gotten
a
warrant,
then
everything
would
have
been
fine.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
a
question
about
whether
the
police
officer
in
a
case
like
this,
an
infraction
of
an
ordinance,
could
have
gotten
a
warrant?
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
the
idea
that
this
is
such
a
minor
thing
that
somebody
shouldn't
be
in
custody.
you
say
he
could
be
in
custody
as
long
as
there's
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
illinois
law
were
otherwise
and
a
warrant
was
obtainable
on
precisely
the
showing
that
the
police
had
here.
would...
do
you
think
that
would
violate
the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
say...
i
thought
your
objection
was
that
there
was
no
good
reason
for
taking
this
person
down
to
the
station.
now
you're
telling
us
it
doesn't
matter
if
there's
any
good
reason,
so
long
as
you
get
a
warrant,
and
a
warrant
doesn't...
you
don't
need
a
good
reason
to
get
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought
your
position
would
be,
you
need
a
good
reason
to
get
a
warrant,
too.
unknown
speaker
he
doesn't
have
to
say
that.
you
just
told
the
chief
justice
he
doesn't
have
to
say
that.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
willing...
so
long
as
a
warrant
issues,
it
doesn't
matter
what
the
conditions
for
the
warrant
are.
unknown
speaker
oh,
we've
also
traditionally
required
a
probable
cause
for
a
warrant
to
be
a
proper
warrant.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
was
probable
cause
of
an
arrestable
offense,
is
the
probable
cause
that
we'd
normally
have.
unknown
speaker
what
about...
what's
a
misdemeanor?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
massachusetts.
massachusetts
defines
misdemeanor
in
terms...
and
felony
in
terms
of
where
you
can
be
incarcerated.
if
you're
incarcerated
in
state
prison,
then
it's
a
felony.
if
it's
not
incarcerated
in
a
state
prison,
it's
not
a
felony.
i've
never
been
able
to
figure
out...
you'd
have
to
go
through
the
statute
books,
decide
where
you
have
to
go
to
concord,
where
you'd
have
to
go
to
walpole,
where
you
could
be
imprisoned
in
a
different
place.
i
mean,
my
point
is
every
state
has
a
different
definition.
unknown
speaker
and
massachusetts
is
really
complicated,
so
i
just
realized
you
can't
tell
me
what
it
is
in
massachusetts.
you
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
is?
in
massachusetts...
i'll
read
you
the
statute.
it
says...
i
mean...
it
says
what
i
said
it
says.
it
says
a
felony
is...
a
crime
punishable
by
imprisonment
in
the
state
prison
is
a
felony.
all
other
crimes
are
misdemeanors.
unknown
speaker
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
is
a
civil
infraction?
unknown
speaker
what's
a
civil
infraction?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
in
other
words
now...
because
that's
easier.
in
other
words,
what
you're
saying
is,
since...
i
mean,
one
of
the
terrible
problems
is
you
have
50
states
and
each
has
a
different
definition
of
misdemeanor
and
felony,
so
i
didn't
know
where
your
rule
applies,
where
it
doesn't
apply.
now,
you
say
we
look
to
the
statute
books
and
we
say,
you
see,
if
it's
punishable
by
fine
only
you
can't
arrest
a
person
even
if
he's
committing
the
crime,
and
if
it's
not
punishable
by
fine
only
you
can.
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
then
i
guess
a
lot
of
things...
you
know,
careless
driving,
reckless
driving,
false
information
to
a
police
officer,
a
fish
and
game
violation...
i
bet
we
went
through
a
lot
of
those,
you
know,
minor
things,
i
bet
we'd
find
in
a
lot
of
states
that
it's
not
just
fine
only,
or
maybe
you've
done
it,
and
maybe
you
know.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well
then,
are
we
really
going
to
separate
the...
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
get
the
really
trivial
things
from
the
more
important
ones,
and
will
a
fine-only
rule
do
it?
unknown
speaker
even
fine-only
offenses,
you
say,
if
they
involve
a
breach
of
the
peace
are
arrestable.
unknown
speaker
that
comes
from
the...
the
breach
of
the
peace
term
comes
from
the
common
law?
and
what
did
it
mean
at
common
law?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
think
it
doesn't
mean
that.
i
think
it
meant
any
violation
of
the
law.
unknown
speaker
that
was--
unknown
speaker
--any
violation
of
the
king's...
any
violation
of
the
law
was
a
violation
of
the
king's
peace.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
it
add
anything
to
your
position
to
say
that
one
can
arrest
in
a
fine-only
case
if
there
is
also
a
breach
of
the
peace,
because
if
there's
a
breach
of
the
peace
in
the
modern
sense,
that
would
be
a
separate
offense
in
virtually
all
states,
i
assume,
and
it
would
be
committed
in
the
officer's
presence
and
so
this
issue
wouldn't
come
up.
we
wouldn't
be
dealing
with
a
fine-only
situation.
we
would
be
dealing
with
somebody
who
was
committing
a
breach
of
the
peace
in
the
officer's
presence,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you
don't
need
that
qualification.
what
you
want
to
say
is--
unknown
speaker
--if
all
you've
got
is
a
fine-only
situation,
no
arrest
without
a
warrant.
unknown
speaker
how
about
reckless
driving?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
is
it
an
affray
in
that
sense?
an
affray
always
seemed
to
me
to
involve
more
than
one
person.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
criteria
are
very...
they
waver
quite
a
bit.
how
about
parking
in
a
no
parking
zone?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
think,
though,
it's
an
out-of-state
vehicle
and
the
driver
may
not
show
up
for
the
hearing?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
happened
to
check
in
at
headquarters
and
found
out
he
had
400
parking
tickets
that
he'd
never
paid?
unknown
speaker
mr.
flaxman,
i
guess
it's
clear
that
the
line-drawing
is
not
going
to
be
simple,
assuming
we
draw
a
line
at
all.
why
do
we...
why
should
we
go
through
this
effort?
what,
as
you
understand
it,
is
the
value
that
is
going
to
be
served
by
drawing
this
line
and
requiring
the
warrant?
what's
important
to
you?
unknown
speaker
why
are
we
giving
general
warrants?
they've
simply...
they've
got
to
justify
the
arrest
by
virtue
of
an
offense
and
probable
cause
to
believe
the
offense
was...
had
been
committed.
that's
the--
unknown
speaker
--well,
no,
that's
not
so.
i
mean,
if
you
say...
depending
on
what
you
mean
by
believe,
assuming
that
the
normal
arrest
standard
requiring
probable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
had
been
committed
will
be
applied
whether
we
have
a
warrant
or
don't
have
a
warrant.
the
officer
does
not
have
a
roving
commission
to
go
out
and
act
upon
unsupported
belief.
i
don't
see
how
that
gets
us
into
a
general
warrant
situation.
it
gets
us
into
a
no-warrant
situation
where
probable
cause
is
nonetheless
required.
unknown
speaker
well,
sometimes
when
they
had
a
general
warrant,
they
could
arrest
without
probable
cause,
the
general
warrant
was
abused.
but
we're
not
talking
about
that
situation.
we're
talking
about
a
situation
in
which
there's
no
warrant
but
there
is
a
probable
cause
requirement,
and
so
on
that
assumption,
what
value
is
going
to
be
served
to
make
it
worth
the
effort
to
go
through
this
fairly...
seemingly
fairly
subtle
line-drawing
exercise.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
that
you
shouldn't...
i
mean,
what
you've
done
is,
you've
picked
examples
where,
i
totally
agree
with
you,
where
it
seems
silly
to
have
the
policeman
arrest
somebody,
but
the
difficulty
for
me
is,
you're
asking
the
court
to
draw
a
line
that,
while
it
would
win
you
your
case
and
deal
with
what
we
might
think
of
as
silly
examples,
might
extend
into
a
lot
of
other
things,
and
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anywhere
in
any
of
these
briefs
that
anyone
has
gone
through
and
figured
out
really
what
crimes
would,
in
the
different
states,
be
encompassed
by
your
rule?
let's
take
your
second
rule,
which
is
the
fine-only
rule.
do
i...
how
could
i
find
that
out?
is
there
any
way
for
me
to
find
that
out,
other
than,
you
know,
set
my
law
clerk
to
work
and
look
through
48...
which
you
could
do
as
easily
as
i.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
then
if
we
can't
ascertain
it,
then
i'd
ask
you
a
second
question.
is
it
your
rule
that
if
we
get
the
fine-only
set
of
circumstances,
and
if
we
look
at
all
those
crimes,
it's
your
rule,
your
idea
that
the
policeman
cannot
arrest
the
person
without
a
warrant,
assuming
no
breach
of
the
peace,
even
if
the
policeman
thinks
he's
going
to
run
away,
never
show
up.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
then
the
total
rule
you
want
is,
you
take
the
fine-only
set
of
crimes,
which
we're
not
certain
what
that
includes,
and
we
say
the
policeman,
even
though
he
sees
the
crime,
cannot
arrest
the
person
unless,
a,
breach
of
the
peace
or
b,
run
away.
is
there
a
c,
or
is
that
the
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
so
you
really
want
us
to
say,
constitutionalize--
unknown
speaker
--that
six
or
eight
part--
unknown
speaker
--well,
supposing
that
the
village
of
arlington
heights
had
had
a
written
policy
and
it
permitted
an
arrest
in
this
case,
would
that
make
it
any
different?
unknown
speaker
would
it
make
it
any
different?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
case
is
authority
for
you
to
sue
a
municipality
because
of
its
policy,
independent
of
what
happened
to
your
particular
client?
unknown
speaker
but
so
you're
saying
that
even
though
he
might
have
been
arrested
under
a
permissible
policy,
if
that
policy
wasn't
in
effect,
his
arrest
is
no
good?
unknown
speaker
mr.--
--what
is
the
policy
that
you
say
arlington
heights
has
that
the
officer
must
effect
a
seizure
for
any
offense?
unknown
speaker
it
takes
the
position,
even
in
the
case
of,
for
instance,
not
wearing
a
seat
belt
in
a
car--
unknown
speaker
--that
no
citation
can
be
issued,
that
the
person
must
be
seized?
is
that
your
understanding
of
the
policy?
unknown
speaker
is
it
the
policy
that
any
violation
of
a...
an
arlington
heights
ordinance
requires
a
seizure?
unknown
speaker
mr.
flaxman--
--now,
you
said
this
is
a
civil
fine,
so
that
if
he
went
to
trial
he
doesn't
get
the
protection
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
unknown
speaker
--a
unanimous
jury
and
so--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
flaxman,
when
you
responded
to
justice
souter,
justice
souter's
question
about,
you
know,
what's
the
harm,
i
thought
you
were
going
to
say
that
the
harm
of
allowing
arrests
for
misdemeanors
is
that
for
the
most
minor
of
offenses
somebody
can
be
detained
for
48
hours.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
you
might
have
answered,
anyway.
[laughter]
but
what's
wrong
with
that?
suppose
you
have
a
real
law-and-order
state
which
simply
adopts
a
law
that
says,
all
misdemeanor...
we're
serious
about
all
our
offenses,
and
even
for
a
misdemeanor
you
are
subject
to
incarceration
for
48
hours.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
would
it
be
unconstitutional
for
a
state
to
impose
48
hours
of
detention
for
jaywalking?
unknown
speaker
never
mind
what
the
court
does
in
this
case--
--it
would
be
permissible
on
probable
cause
rather
than
on
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't
mean
whether
it
would
be
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
the
law
says
that
the
punishment
for
jaywalking
is
48
hours
in...
of
detention.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
no.
i
know
it's
an
entirely
different
question.
what's
the
answer
to
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
saying
if
the
answer
is
that
a
state
can
do
that
if
it
wishes,
then
the
asserted
harm
that
you're
coming
forward
with,
well,
somebody
could
be
detained
for
as
long
as
48
hours,
is
a
harm
which
in
another
fashion,
at
least,
is
fully
achievable
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
that's
one
distinction,
and
another
distinction,
of
course,
is
that
it
would
only
be
the
guilty
who
would
be
detained
for
48
hours.
well,
i
thought
it
was
the
city
legislative
body
that
said
there
would
be
a
seizure,
not...
that's
the
group
that
said
police
officers
will
affect
a
seizure--
unknown
speaker
--for
a
violation
of
our
ordinances.
unknown
speaker
this
is
a
police
department
practice
only?
unknown
speaker
not
authorized
by
city
ordinance.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
were
suing
the
city.
weren't
you
suing
the
city?
unknown
speaker
even
though
the
city
didn't
order
any
of
it?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
seem
right.
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
the
city's
policy,
then.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
it's
the
city's
policy.
unknown
speaker
so--
--mr.
flaxman,
there's
one
thing
one
of
your
answers
suggested
that
makes
me
more
puzzled
by
the
case.
why
don't
you
ask
that
the
line
be
drawn
between
criminal
and
noncriminal
offenses?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
there
are
criminal
fines.
unknown
speaker
there
are
certain...
certainly
there
are
criminal
misdemeanor
offenses
under
the
law
of
most
states
which
are
punishable
only
by
fine,
but
they
are
criminal.
i
thought
you...
this
is
a
case,
as
i
understood
what
you
said
a
moment
ago,
in
which
the
state
has
defined
the
offense
as
being
a
civil
offense.
it
does
not
carry
criminal
stigma,
and
you
agreed
that...
i
think
you
agreed
that
the
criminal
process
would
not
be
required
constitutionally.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
why
don't
you...
why
aren't
you
arguing
that
there
should
be
no
arrest
without
a
warrant
for
a
noncriminal
offense
in
the
absence
of
a
failure
to
respond
to
process,
or
something
of
that
sort?
unknown
speaker
well,
no.
you
argued
the
breach
of
the
peace
hypothetical,
or
the
breach
of
the
peace
distinction,
the
misdemeanor
felony
line,
but
if
this
is
just
a
civil
offense
it
may
be
that
arrest
is
simply
not
permitted.
do
you
have
any
authority
which
would
help
you
in...
if
that
were
to
be
the
line?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
authority
which
says
that
you
can
arrest
for
a
civil
offense?
i
assume
that's--
unknown
speaker
--a
stable
category.
i'm
not
sure.
unknown
speaker
mr.
flaxman,
i
thought
your
question
presented
asked
whether
the
reasonableness
clause
of
the
fourth
amendment
incorporated
the
common
law
rule
prohibiting
warrantless
arrests
in
misdemeanor
cases
not
involving
breach
of
the
peace.
i
didn't
read
into
that
an
allegation
that
a
civil
offense
which
is
not
a
misdemeanor,
not
a
crime,
can
justify
a
seizure.
unknown
speaker
you
seem
to
be
changing
what's
presented.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
assume
this
is
a
misdemeanor
offense--
unknown
speaker
--or
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
even
though
that's
the
question
you
raised.
unknown
speaker
i'm
still
trying
to
figure
out
where
it's
likely
to
have
bite.
i
mean,
would
you
say...
because
you
have
an
odd
case,
no
doubt
about
that.
the...
speeding.
i
suppose
speeding
offenses.
isn't
that
the
normal
thing?
should
a
policeman,
when
he
finds
somebody
speeding,
be
able
to
arrest
him?
unknown
speaker
you'd
say
no.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
why
not?
suppose
i
said,
highways
are
dangerous
places.
people
who
go
around
speeding
kill
a
lot
of
people.
if
the
policeman
sees
somebody
speeding
and
thinks
he
should
arrest
him,
he
ought
to
be
able
to
arrest
him.
at
least
the
state
should
have
the
power
to
make
that
determination.
why
not?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
a
crime,
you
say.
unknown
speaker
and
in
most
states,
can
they
or
can't
they?
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
flaxman.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
would
you
please
tell
us
what
this
is?
is
it
a
civil
offense
in
the
city
of
arlington,
or
is
it
a
criminal
offense?
is
it
a
misdemeanor?
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you're
right
about
that,
but
could
you
tell
us,
is
there
authority
which
allows
an
arrest
for
a
so-called
civil
offense,
i
suppose
just
to
start
the
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
that
was
the
old
arrest
for
debt,
wasn't
it,
arrest
on
so-called
mean
process?
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
general
civil
process.
unknown
speaker
but
those
arrests
always
required
warrants,
didn't
they?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
i
didn't
think
there
could
ever
be
a
warrantless
arrest
on
a
civil
capias.
i
mean,
by
definition
capias
is
the
written
document,
which
is
an
arrest
warrant.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
be
that
there
can
be
no
line
drawn
between
civil
and
criminal
for
purposes
of
arrest,
but
there
may
very
well
be
a
line
drawn
between
civil
and
criminal
for
purposes
of
a
warrant
requirement,
and
if
the
reference
is,
as
you
said,
to
the
capias
process,
that
was
by
definition
one
in
which
there
was
a
written
warrant.
it
was
called
a
capias
in
civil
cases,
but
it
was
still
an
arrest
warrant.
unknown
speaker
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
decide,
because
let's
assume
that
not
having...
as
once
i
did
look
into
that,
i
think
that
the
point
about
arresting
legislatures
is
irrelevant,
something
totally
different.
on
that
assumption,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
with
this
case?
i
thought
the
case
was
here
to
decide
this
question
of
whether
or
not
an
undoubted
crime,
something
that
everybody
concedes
is
criminal,
but
it's
called
a
misdemeanor,
or
it's
a
crime
punishable
only
by
a
fine,
whether
or
not
you
could
arrest
someone
without
a
warrant.
now,
what
we're
saying
is
that
isn't
this
case.
this
case
is
perhaps
not
an
undoubted
crime.
this
case
is
perhaps
a
civil
offense
or
something
that's
not
a
crime,
so
what
in
your
view,
are
we
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
strauss,
where
did
you
say
respondents
first
raised
the
contention
that
this
was
a
civil
offense?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
the
village
knew
that
it
was
dealing
with.
the
village
and
its
police
should
have
known
that
they
were
dealing
with
a
civil
offense,
and
wouldn't
that
be
quite
worrisome
if
the
police
think
that
all
these
civil
offenses
are
occasions
to
arrest
someone
and
lock
them
up?
unknown
speaker
and
we're
going
to
have
all
sorts
of
different
tests
for
duration,
a
48-hour
rule
will
not
apply
in
some
cases?
unknown
speaker
this
person
could
have
been
held
for
48
hours?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
could
the
police
in
this
case
have
handcuffed
him,
put
him
in
a
holding
cell
with
a
lot
of
tough
guys?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
unreasonable
based
on
the
type
of
offense?
unknown
speaker
what
authority
is
there
for
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
i
have
a
different
concern
that
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on,
not
going
to
the
burdensomeness
of
the
arrest,
but
is
it
clear
to
you
that
in
a...
incident
to
this
arrest
the
police
could
have
searched
this
man
and
his
vehicle
and
his
luggage
and
everything
else
if
they
happened
to
stop
him
in
a
car
for
this
kind
of
offense?
would
they
have
had
all
those
powers?
unknown
speaker
well,
see,
we
don't
have
a
traffic
offense.
unknown
speaker
if
this...
take
this
sort
of
financial
crime.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
this
is
a
full
arrest,
then
that's
one
of
the
consequences
that
follow,
is
that
the...
the
total
search
power.
search
the
car,
search
the
luggage,
search
the
trunk
and
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me
that's
really
what
we
ought
to
be
concerned
about,
rather
than
whether
he
has
to
spend
24
hours
instead
of
48
hours.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand,
but
there
could
have
been.
there
could
have
been.
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
robinson
would
control
as
to
the
search
of
the--
unknown
speaker
--who
was
arrested.
i
don't
think
it
would
control
at
all
as
to
a
search
of
the
car.
unknown
speaker
or
the
luggage.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
belton,
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
policy
with
which
we're
dealing
in
this
case?
would
you
articulate
it?
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
include
minor
traffic
offenses?
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
it...
this
may
not
count
in
the
decision
of
the
case,
but
i
thought
the
reason
that
arlington
heights
had
for
its
policy
was
a...
to
be
candid,
a
rather
superficial
one.
they
said,
well,
we
just
simply
don't
have
a
documentary
process
for
field
summonses,
and...
which
doesn't
really
cut
much
if
we
get
to
that
issue.
you're
now
saying
that
they
feel
that
the
discretion
should
be...
as
to
how
far
to
go,
to
bond
or
not
to
bond,
should
be
made
by
a
superior
officer
and
that's
the
reason
that
they
do
not
have
this
field
processing
scheme?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
isn't
this
unusual?
i
think
in
many
places
a
summons
in
lieu
of
an
arrest
is
common
even
for
a
misdemeanor
that
carries
jail
time,
and
here
you've
told
us
that
this
is
a
civil
category
and
that
the
police
have
only
two
choices,
either
let
him
go
with
a
warning
or,
if
they
want
to
pursue
this
civil
process,
they
have
to
take
him
into
full
custody.
that
seems
rather
extreme.
unknown
speaker
mr.
strauss,
let
me
get
back
again
to
the
point
that
you
say
was
raised
only
for
the
first
time
in
the
reply
brief.
in
the...
the
second
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
says,
may
a
municipality
require
its
police
officers
to
make
full
custodial
arrests
for
an
alleged
violation
of
a
fine-only
license
ordinance.
now,
it
seems
to
me
if...
the
fine-only
license
ordinance
is
fairly
raised
by
that
question
presented.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
a
fine-only
license
ordinance
doesn't
suggest
civil
rather
than
criminal?
unknown
speaker
a
criminal--
--well,
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
if
we
assume
now
that
it
is
a
civil
offense,
and
not
a
criminal
misdemeanor
offense,
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
prevent
the
city's
policy
of
seizure
and
removal
to
the
station
house?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
rely
on
in
terms
of
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if
you're
going
to
appeal
the
history,
i
think
you've
got
the
problem
that
was
raised
earlier.
there
is
undoubted
history
that
there
could
be
arrests
for
civil
offenses,
but
i
think
there
is
not
undoubted
history,
and
i
think
there
is
not
any
history
that
there
could
be
arrests
for
civil
or...
for
civil
offenses
without
some
written
arrest
warrant,
whether
you
call
it
capias
or
some
other
term,
and
that's
the
issue
here,
not
whether
you
can
arrest
or
not.
unknown
speaker
let's
do
it...
i
just
want
to
work
out
the
answer
that
you
just
gave
to
justice
o'connor.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
that
you
do
not
have
any
authority,
know
of
any
authority,
traditionally,
at
common
law,
for
arrest
for
a
purely
civil
offense
without
some
written
process
issued
by
a
magistrate,
i.e.,
like
a
capias.
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
was,
but
leaving
aside
the
problem
of
indistinction,
i
take
it
you
don't
have
any
authority
with
respect
to
cases
that
were
on
the
civil
side
of
the
line,
in
which
the
common
law
recognized
a
valid
arrest
without
some
written
process
issued
by
a
third
party
like
a
magistrate.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
want
to
cut
off
your
argument,
but
i
don't
want
to
lose
my
question.
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
any
authority
for
that,
or
don't
you
have
authority?
unknown
speaker
what
are
they?
unknown
speaker
so
like
the
terry
stop,
in
other
words.
unknown
speaker
but
in
order
to
prevail
here,
you've
got
to
take
the
law
beyond
terry.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
quarrel
that
there
is
a
distinction
in
the
fourth
amendment
between
a
seizure
that
is
not
an
arrest
and
a
seizure
that
is
an
arrest?
unknown
speaker
is
there...
can
you
give
me
an
example,
so
i
know
what
i'm
talking
about
here...
would
you
just
give
me
an
example
of
a
fine-only
criminal
offense?
is
there...
just
give
me
one...
this
one
apparently
isn't
clear,
because
we
think
maybe
this
isn't
criminal,
so
what's
an
example
of
something
that
is
a
criminal
offense
that
is
punishable
only
by
a
fine,
some
bad
ones
if
you
can
think
of
some.
are
there
any?
unknown
speaker
what
i
want
to
know
is
if
anybody
here
has
an
example
of
what
it
is
we're
talking
about?
i
thought
when
we
started
this
we
were
talking
about
misdemeanors.
now
we're
not.
we're
talking
about
fine-only
offenses,
and
then
i
thought
maybe
there
were
some
fine-only
offenses
that
are
criminal,
and
so
i'd
have
to
face
that
constitutional
question.
now
i
have
one
that
may
be
criminal,
may
not
be
criminal.
it's
an
odd
animal.
is
there
one,
if
we
write
an
opinion,
that
i'd
at
least
know
it
affects
that
one,
and
what
is
it?
what's
a
fine-only
criminal
offense
that's
undoubtedly
criminal,
that's...
you
apparently
don't
have
an
example--
unknown
speaker
--and
i
haven't
found
it
in
the
brief,
so
i'm
not--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
certainly
isn't
the
one
before
us,
and
i
think
you
told
us
that
most
of
the...
in
arlington
most
of
the
offenses
in
this
category
are
civil
offenses.
these,
not
having
a
license
to
do
something
or
other.
unknown
speaker
does...
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
the
booking
and
the
record.
is
it
the
same
as
in
an
arrest
in
a
criminal...
for
a
criminal
prosecution,
the
way
the
person
is
booked
and
the
record,
the
police
record
that
that
person...
the
arrest
record
that
the
person
will
have?
unknown
speaker
suppose
he
was
asked,
was
he
ever
arrested?
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
the
same,
so
he
would
have
to
answer
that
question
the
same,
and
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
it
was
a
misdemeanor
with
jail
time,
he
has
an
arrest
record.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
flaxman
said
that
this
business
about
the
bond
requirement,
on
the
face
of
it
it
looks
like
there
could
be
several
thousand
dollars
involved,
and
so
it
would
be
reasonable
to
require
a
bond
before
letting
this
person
go,
but
mr.
flaxman
said
that
that
was
an
afterthought.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
strauss,
terry
aside,
do
you
know
any
basis
in
common
law
for
the
distinction
between
an
arrest
that
enables
you
to
be
taken
down
to
the
station
house
and
a
traffic
stop,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
that
does
not
allow
you
to
be
taken
down
to
the
station
house?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
even
if
there's
no
common
law
category
such
as
terry,
we
surely
have
recognized
many,
many
situations
in
which
police
are
authorized
to
stop
and
interrogate,
even
without
probable
cause,
and
those
are
all
seizures.
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
it
doesn't
require
probable
cause.
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
here...
all
we
have
here
is
taking
him
to
the
police
station
to
book
him.
there's
nothing
more.
like,
they
didn't...
do
we
have
to
consider
whether
48
hours,
and
searches
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
strauss.
unknown
speaker
ms.
millett.
unknown
speaker
what
makes
them
criminal
rather
than
civil,
just
saying
so?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
consequence
of
its
being
criminal--
unknown
speaker
--not
a
cause
of
its
being
criminal.
i
mean,
so
it's
up
to
the
state
to
say,
we're
going
to
impose
this
fine
and
make
it
a
civil
fine,
and
therefore
you
don't
get
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
this
is
not
a
criminal
offense,
then
what
is
the
government's
position?
unknown
speaker
does
the
federal
government
have
some
civil
offenses
that
are
not
criminal?
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
position
with
regard
to
those--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
the
fourth
amendment
requirements?
unknown
speaker
the
issue,
if--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
interrupt
you?
the
issue
is
not
whether
arrest
may
comport
with
the
fourth
amendment,
but
arrest
without
any
process
issued
by
a
magistrate
or
some
third
party.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
seventh
circuit
rule
that
the
petitioner
had
waived
his
argument
under
the
warrant
clause?
unknown
speaker
every
example
that
you
gave
involved
the
risk
of
absconding
or
fleeing.
you
want
to
deport
someone,
extradite
someone,
there's
a
high
risk
that
person
won't
be
there
if
you
let
them
out
on
the
street.
unknown
speaker
but
here
we're
talking
about,
i
didn't
get
a
license
for
my
business,
that
my
wife
got
while
i
was
in
the
police
station.
it
was
that
easy.
so
when
you
don't
have
a
breach
of
the
peace,
and
when
you
don't
have
the
risk
that
the
person
will
flee,
then
what
is
the
justification?
what
is
the
reason
for
permitting
an
arrest?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we
asked
you...
you
were
giving
examples
of
civil
proceedings--
unknown
speaker
--where
an
arrest
would
be
recognized
as
reasonable,
and
they
were
all...
fall
in
the
"exigent
circumstance"
category.
unknown
speaker
someone
about
to
commit
suicide,
for
example.
unknown
speaker
but
this...
what's
in
front
of
us
doesn't
seem
to
fit.
what
would
be...
now,
we
have...
the
kind
of
offense
that's
involved
is
failure
to
get
a
license
to
operate
some
kind
of
business.
what
circumstances
would
justify
an
arrest
for
such
an
infraction?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well--
--we're
talking
about
a
civil
case.
--that's
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
robinson
opinion,
i
say
perhaps
because
i
wrote
it--
[laughter]
--that
it
lays
down
a
flat
rule.
now,
you
say...
are
you
balancing
in
every
individual
case--
unknown
speaker
--whether
you
can
make
an
arrest?
that's
hardly
workable.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
is
it
fair
to
say
that
you
briefed
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
we
were
dealing
with
a
criminal
offense?
unknown
speaker
that's
all
irrelevant
for
this
case,
right?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--but
now
we
know
we
are
dealing
with
a
civil
infraction,
so
how
can
we
pretend
that
it's
criminal
when
it's...
we're
told
that
it's
civil?
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
to
conclude
that.
we
were
told
that
by
mr.
strauss,
that
this
is
in
fact
in
the
city
of
arlington
a
civil
offense.
unknown
speaker
we
should
forgive
the
waiver?
i
mean,
the
point
wasn't
raised
below.
should
we
instruct
the
lower
court
to
give
the
defendant
another...
or
the
plaintiff
another
swing?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
you
were
saying
we
should
read
the
second
question,
in
light
of
the
record,
as
saying
is
this
particular
criminal
offense
one
for
which
you
could
arrest
someone.
wasn't
that
your
position,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
which
is
criminal.
in
other
words,
i
take
it--
unknown
speaker
--so
i
take
it
you're
not...
i
thought...
you
think
we
should
do
the
same,
i
take
it,
as
you
did.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
a
hypothetical
question
when
we
know
it
is
not
criminal.
unknown
speaker
how
can
we
then
say,
well,
we'll
assume
that
it's
waived,
that
we'll
treat
something
that
the
city
says
is
civil
as
criminal?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
that
we
should
dismiss
the
writ
as
improvidently
granted,
because
we
thought
we
were
dealing
with
a
criminal
offense
and
it
turns
out
to
be
civil.
unknown
speaker
yes.
