it's
not
an
advisory
opinion
in
this
case
if
that
issue
was
not
raised
below.
it's
been
tried
on
the
assumption
that
it's
criminal.
why
is
it
advisory
in
this
case?
i,
for
one,
would
certainly
not
send
it
back
to
let
this
new
point
be
dredged
up
when
it
was
simply
foregone
in
the
trial
below,
so
i
don't
see
why
it's
an
abstract
case.
i
mean,
we
have
a
real
case
before
us
that's
been
tried
on
this
assumption,
and
it
seems
to
me
we
can
decide
it
on
that
assumption.
it
just
doesn't
conform
to
the
facts.
