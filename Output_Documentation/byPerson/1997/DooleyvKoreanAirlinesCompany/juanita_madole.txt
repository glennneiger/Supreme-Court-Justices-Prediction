ms.

ms.
juanita
madole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
presented
here
today
is
whether
there
is
a
general
maritime
law
survival
cause
of
action
for
the
pre-death
injuries
to
a
nonseafarer
when
the
conduct
that
causes
the
injuries
occurs
on
the
high
seas
and
whether,
if
there
is
such
a
survival
cause
of
action
under
general
maritime
law,
it
may
be
brought
independent
of
but
coexisting
alongside
the
death
action
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
in
order
to
understand
the
argument,
it
is
important
to
point
out
the
distinctions
between
the
survival
cause
of
action
and
the
wrongful
death
cause
of
action.
as
this
court
has
stated
several
times,
the
survival
cause
of
action
traditionally
encompassed...
encompasses
the
injuries
that
the
individual
he
or
herself
sustained
prior
to
death
from
the
time
of
the
injury.
those
traditionally
encompassed
pre-death
pain
and
suffering,
loss
of
earnings
from
the
time
of
injury
to
the
time
of
death,
and
any
medical
or
associated
expenses
relating
to
the
injuries
until
the
time
of
death.
in
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
today,
the
petitioners
only
have
a
right
to
claim
for
pre-death
injuries,
for
pre-death
pain
and
suffering,
for
the
12
minutes
that
their
decedent
suffered
from
the
time
the
aircraft
upon
which
they
were
passengers
were
fired
upon
until
a
12-minute
controlled
descent
into
the
sea
of
japan
and
their
ultimate
deaths.
by
comparison
with
survival
actions--
ms.
juanita
madole
--that's
correct,
and
respondent
in
their
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
also
agreed
that
the
rule
of
the
court...
that
this
court
will
lay
down
will
be
applied
whenever
the
conduct
causes
the
injuries
and
ultimately
causes
the
death
occurring
on
the
high
seas.
in
a
more
typical
accident,
they
probably
will
be
more
boat-based
fact
patterns,
but
the
context
in
which
the
case
is
before
the
court
is...
does
arise
out
of
an
airplane
accident
and
does
address
only
pre-death
pain
and
suffering
and
injuries.
by
comparison
with
survival
action
injuries,
wrongful
death
remedies...
excuse
me,
survival
action
remedies,
by
contrast
wrongful
death
remedies,
are
losses
that
the
family
members
of
the
decedent
themselves
have
sustained,
those
losses
that
are
individual
to
the
family
members,
are
as
a
result
of
the
death
of
the
decedent
and
are
normally
economically
based.
normally
they
are
for
loss
of
support,
for
loss
of
economic
support
that
the
decedent
would
have
provided
had
the
decedent
continued
to
live,
loss
of
services,
household
services
and,
in
the
case
of
a
parent
leaving
small
children,
loss
of
parental
services
to
the
small
children.
the
beneficiaries
are
different.
in
a
survival
cause
of
action
the
estate
is
the
beneficiary,
as
the
holder
of
the
individual
injured
person's
claim
after
his
death.
in
a
wrongful
death--
ms.
juanita
madole
--what
occurred
is,
i
believe,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
original
fela
was
patterned
after
lord
campbell's
act.
lord
campbell's
act
required
that
the
cause
of
action
exist
in
the
person
at
the
time
of
the
death
for
there
to
be
a
right
to
recover
for
survival
and
for
death.
the
fela
was
amended
in
1910
to
provide
for
both
causes
of
action.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
which
is
the--
ms.
juanita
madole
--yes,
justice
ginsburg.
in
michigan
central
railway
v.
vreeland
the
court
said
you
could
not
have
both
a
survival
action
and
a
wrongful
death
action
under
the
fela,
and
that
was
then
amended
by
congress
in
1910.
but
the
basis
for
that
was
because
the
wrongful
death
action
under
fela
was
based
upon
a
lord
campbell's
act
type
of
statute
which
required
the
existence
of
a
cause
of
action
in
the
decedent
at
the
time
of
the
death,
and
if
there
had
been
recovery
for
survival
there
could
not
also
be
a
death
recovery.
in
this
circumstance,
the
statute
that
we
are
dealing
with
is
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
and
the
argument
by
respondent
and
the
amicus
is
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
precludes
the
court's
traditional
development
of
a
survival
cause
of
action.
ms.
juanita
madole
it
does
not
in
that
it
did
not
require
the
existence
of
the
cause
of
action
in
the
decedent
prior
to
death,
so
that
there
is
no
foreclosure
of
a
survival
cause
of
action
alongside
a
wrongful
death
cause
of
action.
the
only
issue
that
the
respondent
and
the
government
bring
up
with
regard
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
is
whether,
by
enacting
the
wrongful
death
remedy,
that
the
congress
intended
to
foreclose
this
court's
traditional
role
in
maritime
actions
to
develop
law
as
policies
change,
so
there's
nothing
in
the
wrongful
death
act
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
itself
that
would
foreclose--
ms.
juanita
madole
--well,
it
is
to
a
limited
degree,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
is
that
congress
decided
it
wanted
to
provide
a
remedy
from
what
it
felt
was
the
harsh
rule
of
the
harrisburg,
that
there
was
no
common
law
right
to
recover
for
wrongful
death.
they
wanted
to
provide
the
remedy
in
a
limited
area.
the
debates
in
the
congressional
record
are
a)
that
the
congress
wanted
to
have
a
remedy
and
b)
how
far
should
that
remedy
go?
should
the
remedy
go
only
from
the
3-miles
limit
from
the
shores
of
the
united
states,
or
should
congress
legislate
into
the
territorial
waters?
congress
decided
just
to
legislate
for
death
action
and
just
to
legislate
from
the
3-mile
limit
outwards,
and
just
as
this
court
in
moragne
said
as
long
as
congress
did
not
speak
to
an
area
that
was
not
within
its
ambit,
the
admiralty
court
is
free
to
develop
in
accordance
with
its
traditional
capacity
to
effectuate
the
policies
of
the
common
law
as
circumscribed
for
the
circumstances
on
the
sea.
ms.
juanita
madole
to
that
extent,
but
that...
thank
you.
765
should
be
put
in
the
context
of
the
statute
as
a
whole.
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
enacted
so
that
the
statute
of
limitations
began
to
run
from
the
date
of
the
wrongful
conduct,
other
than
most
typical
wrongful
death
statutes,
where
the
statute
of
limitations
begin...
begins
to
run
from
the
date
of
the
death.
what
congress
was
attempting
to
do
in
section
765
was
to
say
that
if
an
injured
person
lived
past
the
2-year
statute,
then
the
wrongful
death
right
would
be
abated
to
his
or
her
beneficiaries
because
the
2
years
had
run,
because
of
the
peculiarity
of
it
beginning
from
the
date
of
the
wrongful
conduct
instead
of
the
wrongful
death.
the
courts
below
in...
not
in
the
case
directly
in
the
court
below,
but
other
courts
below
that
have
addressed
these
issues,
and
the
commentators
both
at
the
time
and
subsequently,
have
said
that
section
765
should
best
be
deemed
a
non-abatement
section
and
not
a
survival
section,
because
what
happened
under
section
9...
or
765
was,
the
remedy
was
then
turned
into
a
wrongful
death
remedy
so
that
the
heirs
and
the
beneficiaries
of
the
decedent
could
recover
wrongful
death
damages
but
nothing
was
said
in
the
statute
about
what
happened
to
the
injured
person's
pre-death
injuries,
and
that
was
not
addressed.
and
again
congress
was
silent
as
to
the
pre-death
injuries
which
is
why,
if
the
court
elects
to,
it
has
the
capacity
to
develop
general
maritime
law
to
address
pre-death
injuries
and
the
survival
cause
of
action.
ms.
juanita
madole
and
again,
it
has
to
be
read
in
the
context
of
what
it
was
attempting
to
achieve,
and
what
congress
was
attempting
to
achieve
was
a
rights-granting
statute.
it
wanted
to
ensure
that
wrongful
conduct
that
occurred
on
the
high
seas
would
not
be
such
that
the
conduct...
there
would
be
no
compensation
for
the
wrongfulness
of
the
conduct
to
the
one
that
was
injured.
ms.
juanita
madole
well,
it
could
be
read
that
way,
justice
souter,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
if
you
look
into
the
historical
background
of
what
congress
is
trying
to
achieve,
that
that
effectuates
the
remedial
effects--
ms.
juanita
madole
--and
again,
from
the
legislative
history,
it's
very
hard
to
decide
that.
ms.
juanita
madole
pardon
me?
ms.
juanita
madole
just
from
the
language
itself.
then
i
suggest
that
we
look
to
the
language
that
is
at
section
763a,
which
is
the
new
statute
of
limitations
that
was
enacted
in
1980.
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
original
section
763
provided
for
a
2-year
statute
of
limitations
to
begin
as
of
the
date
of
the
wrongful
conduct.
in
1980,
congress
repealed
section
763
and
inserted
section...
excuse
me,
and
enacted
section
763a,
which
is--
ms.
juanita
madole
--it
does
cover
causes
of
action
under
general
maritime
law,
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
and
under
the
jones
act,
and
it
changed
the
statute
from
one
in
which
the
statute
began
to,
begin
to
run
from
the
date
of
the
wrongful
conduct
until
it
begins
to
run
from
the
cause...
the
date
the
cause
of
action
accrues,
and
it
extended
the
statute
to
3
years
for
all
three
of
those
issues.
but
if
anything
can
be
said
from
the
language
in
that,
is
that
if
congress
ever
may
have
indicated
in
1920
that
it
didn't
recognize
that
both
survival
actions
and
death
actions
or
both
can
be
brought
together,
at
least
by
1980
they
were
saying
that
they
knew
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
actions
and
that
one
and
the
other
could
both
be
brought
concurrently
with
each
other.
and
it
is
not
clear
from
the
legislative
history
of
7...
section
763a
the
prompting
mechanism
for
that,
but
it's
certainly
clear
that
by
that
time
the
courts
had
begun
to
develop
along
the
lines
of...
along
the
ken
of...
the
rationale
of
this
court
in
moragne
that
there
were
general
maritime
law
of
survival
causes
of
action,
based
upon
the
same
rationale
that
the
harrisburg,
whether
or
not
it
was
rightly
decided
when
it
had
been
decided
originally,
the
underpinnings
of
it
had
changed
because
the
policy
had
changed
and
the
jurisprudence
had
changed,
and
that
there
was
a
wholesale
acceptance
of
wrongful
death
causes
of
action
in
the
united
states.
under
the
same
analysis,
many
of
the
federal
appellate
courts
had
found
that
there
was
a
general
maritime
law
of
survival
cause
of
action
that,
it
was
as
a
result
of
the
policy
change
and
the
jurisprudence
in
the
united
states,
because
of
the
widespread
adoption
of
survival
statutes
amongst
the
states
as
well
as
on
the
federal
level.
ms.
juanita
madole
the
lower
courts
and
many
commentators
have
said
that
the
legislative
history
of
the
jones
act
is
not
clear,
and
that
the
provision
of
a
survival
cause
of
action
in
the
jones
act
is
solely
because
of
its
wholesale
incorporation
of
the
fela
into
it.
we
have
to
look
at
the
statute
that
is
arguably
by
the
respondent
the
one
that
precludes
the
court
from
doing
a
general
maritime
law
analysis
to
determine
if
the
policy
is
such
that
there
should
be
a
survival
cause
of
action
and,
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
our
argument
is
there
is
no
survival
cause
of
action.
there
is
no
survival
language
in
the
statute,
the
statute
itself
addresses
only
wrongful
death
remedies,
and
therefore
there
is
a
void
left
that
the
court
may
fill
with
a
survival
cause
of
action.
ms.
juanita
madole
mr.
chief
justice,
what
congress
granted
certainly
was
remedies
for
deaths
on
the
high
seas.
what
it
did
not
discuss
was
remedies
for
survival
on
the
high
seas,
and
if
you
look
to
this
court's
traditional
preemption
and
preclusion
procedures,
then
unless
the
congressional
statute
specifically
preempts
or
precludes
the
court
from
developing
common
law
remedies,
then
the
court,
particularly
in
its
traditional
role
in
maritime
matters,
has
the
right
to
develop
what
it
feels
is
the
proper
policy,
the
better
law--
ms.
juanita
madole
--for
the
proposition
that--
ms.
juanita
madole
--i'm
sorry,
it
was
in
a
couple
of
parts.
i'm
not
sure--
ms.
juanita
madole
--the
cases
that
are
in
the
reply
brief,
your
honor,
that
deal
with
preemption,
in
the
context
of
statutes--
ms.
juanita
madole
--the
most
common
fact
circumstance
that
comes
up
and
appears
in
the
preemption
context
is
of
state
laws,
or
of
common
law
remedies
under
state
laws,
and
what
you--
ms.
juanita
madole
--medtronics.
ms.
juanita
madole
which
is
at--
ms.
juanita
madole
--common
law.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
ms.
juanita
madole
general
maritime
law
is
a
species
of
common
law,
judge-made
law.
ms.
juanita
madole
then
the
closest
case
that
is
in
the
context
of
the
issue
that
we're
here
before
is
the
moragne
case,
where
the
court
said
that
congress
had
only
legislated
as
far
outward
as
the
3-mile
limit,
and
that
because
it
had
not
gone
into
the
territorial
water
jurisdiction
with
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
the
court
was
free
to
develop
the
common
law--
ms.
juanita
madole
--in
a
federal--
ms.
juanita
madole
--under
federal
common
law
aegis,
and
to
then
identify
a
general
maritime
law
right
to
recover
for
wrongful
death.
that
is
the
same
context
in
which
we
are
arguing
that
the
congress
did
not
address
the
survival
cause
of
action
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
and
since
the
remedies
are
so
different,
and
they
don't
overlap
with
each
other,
then
the
court
has
the
capacity
to
develop
the
common
law
survival
cause
of
action
for
pre-death
remedies.
ms.
juanita
madole
well,
when
congress
enacted
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
in
1920,
it
was
true
that
there
was
no
common
law
right
of
survivorship
of
personal
injury
actions.
since
then,
using
the
same
rationale
that
the
court
has
used
in
moragne,
the
court
has
the
capacity
to
develop
a
survival
cause
of
action
for
pre-death
injuries
because--
ms.
juanita
madole
--because
unless
the
court
finds
there's
a
general
maritime
law
survival
cause
of
action,
there
is
no
recovery
for
all
the
pre-death
injuries
that
occur
from
the
date
of
the
injury
to
the
date
of
death
for
someone
injured
on
the
high
seas
regardless
of
the
extent
of
the
injury,
regardless
of
the
length
of
time
between
the
injury
and
the
death,
and
those
serious,
can
be
serious
and
significant
and
very
large--
ms.
juanita
madole
--there
are
two
responses,
justice
scalia,
to
that
inquiry.
the
first
is
that
if
the
person
survives
for
a
lengthy
amount
of
time
and
incurs
significant
expenses
in
the
medical
care,
loss
of
earnings,
and
has
not
had
a
chance
to
be
compensated
for
those
injuries
before
his
death,
which
he
wouldn't
be
because
it's
a
survival
action,
all
the
debts
are
still
part
of
his
estate
that
have
to
be
paid
from
his
heirs,
if
he
has
any,
with
no
compensation
from
the
wrongdoer.
and
the
second
part
of
that
is
that
i
respectfully
disagree
with
the
respondent
that
there
will
be
few
times
when
there
will
be
no
wrongful
death
beneficiaries
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
any
time
a
young
person
is
killed,
a
teenager
or
a
college
student
who
does
not
have
an
earning
history
and
has
no...
has
parents
but
no...
they
have
no
potential
for
economic
support
from
them,
any
time
elderly
people
who
are
on
social
security
are
killed
and
leave
adult
surviving
children,
any
time
a
couple
is
killed
together
in
an
airplane
accident,
and
do
not
leave
minor
children,
there
are
no
wrongful
death
beneficiaries
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
the
factual
circumstances
today
are
that
there
will
be
many,
many
instances
where
there
will
be
no
wrongful
death
beneficiaries
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act--
ms.
juanita
madole
--in
the--
ms.
juanita
madole
--there
are
the
cases
that
arise
out
of
the
korean
air
lines
accident
that
do
that
for
the
issue
of
the
pain
and
suffering,
but
those
are
not
petitioners'
cases
before
this
court.
i
think
that
there
are
many
circumstances
that
could
be
shown.
the
bodden
case,
for
example,
out
of
the
fifth
circuit,
is
a
case
in
which
mr.
bodden
was
seriously
injured
in
an
engine
explosion.
ms.
juanita
madole
engine...
fire...
engine
explosion
on
a
ship.
ms.
juanita
madole
and
he
died
3
years
afterwards.
i'm
sorry,
the
fact
pattern
is
not
following
along
in
response
to
your
inquiry.
i'm
sorry.
but
there
are
certainly
statistics
that
can
be
referred
to--
ms.
juanita
madole
--well,
the
issue
of
the
evolution
of
the
pre-death
pain
and
suffering
under
the
survival
action
claim
has
been
around
a
long
time.
it
was
raised
before
this
court
in
miles
v.
apex,
and
in
that
context,
as
a
jones...
in
the
jones
act
seaman,
but
the
court
referred
to
in
the
opinion
the
development
of
the
common
law
survival
cause
of
action
by
the
lower
courts
and
did
not--
ms.
juanita
madole
--that's
true,
and
twice
this
court
has
refused
to
approve
or
disapprove
use
of
state
survival
actions
when
the
deaths
occur
on
the
high
seas.
that's
back
in
kernan
and
offshore
logistics
v.
tallentire.
so
the
courts
below
have
not
been
prohibited
by
this
court,
because
of
this
refusal
to
disapprove
the
conduct,
of
applying
state
survival
causes
of
action
for
deaths
that
occur
on
the
high
seas,
so
it
may
be
that
those
actions
are
compensated
by
those
state
survivals
when
the
courts
do
apply
them.
in
this
case,
however,
we
have
an
action
that
clearly
is
far
beyond
any
argument
that
a
state
survival
statute--
ms.
juanita
madole
--that
is
correct.
there's
been
a
bill
pending
about
2
years.
it
is
a
bill
that
was
effectuated
or
was
drafted
as
a
result
of
the
twa
800
accident
that
crashed
off
of
new
york.
because
there
were
a
large
number
of
passengers
on
board
that
flight
who,
if
there
was
no
survival
cause
of
action,
or
if
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
only
applied,
the
parents
of
these
young
kids,
a
group
of
schoolchildren
from
pennsylvania,
would
have
no
compensation
at
all.
ms.
juanita
madole
higginbotham
does
not
decide
the
issue,
because
the
issue
there
was
whether
the
general
maritime
law...
was
whether
the
general
maritime
law
death
action
could
be
superimposed
on
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
death
action.
ms.
juanita
madole
but
that's
because
that
is
only
the
wrongful
death
action
idea
behind
both
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
the
general
maritime
law
remedy.
the
survival
action
is
parallel
to.
it's
like
the
two
columns.
they
are
different
remedies.
they
are
different--
ms.
juanita
madole
--and
they
don't--
ms.
juanita
madole
--they
don't
overlap,
and
the
only
language
that--
ms.
juanita
madole
--because
all
of
the
verbs
and
nouns
that
you
used
have
to
do
with
wrongful
death
remedies
except
for
the
survival,
which
i
suggest
to
the
court
is
that
argument
under
765,
which
is
really
a
nonabatement
provision
and
not
a
survival
action
prohibition,
because
it
doesn't
change
the
cause
of
action
into
pre-death
injury
remedies.
it
keeps
them
in
wrongful
death
remedies.
ms.
juanita
madole
it
currently
is
in
its...
i'm
not
sure
how
many
reiterations...
it's
been
changing
quite
a
lot.
it's
nowhere
near,
as
far
as
i
know,
being
passed.
ms.
juanita
madole
the
primary
focus
of
it
is
that
it
would
remove
airplane
accident
cases
from
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
ms.
juanita
madole
some...
that's
one
of
the
reasons
why
it
is
not
quite
fixed.
it's
not
sure
if
it's
a
traditional
choice
of
law
analysis.
it's
not
sure
if
it
would
be
the
law
of
the
place
where
the
airplane
took
off
from.
there
are
all
sorts
of
proposals
that
are
pending--
ms.
juanita
madole
--it
would
be
some
state
law.
however
you
would
get
there
is
not...
has
not
been
decided.
ms.
juanita
madole
as
best
i
know,
as
it's
currently
pending.
