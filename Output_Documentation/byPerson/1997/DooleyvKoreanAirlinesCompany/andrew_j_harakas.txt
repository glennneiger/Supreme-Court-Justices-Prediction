mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
harakas.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
just
to
pick
up
justice
ginsburg's
questions
regarding
the
pending
legislation,
back
in
1996,
in
the
summer
of
'96
they
did
pass...
congress
passed
a
bill
in
the
house
of
representatives
which
would
have
just
removed
aviation
cases
from
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
however,
there
also
was
similar
legislation
pending
in
the
house
of
representatives
which
would
have
taken
aviation
cases
but
set
forth
the
types
of
recoverable
damages.
under
the
proposed
bill,
senate
bill
943,
it
would
say
you
could
recover
damages
under
state
law,
any
damages
available
under
federal
common
law,
and/or
any
damages
available
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
as
you
can
see,
it
could
create
a
choice-of-law
nightmare
as
to
what
types
of
damages
you
could
recover.
however,
there
was
a
hearing
last
october
and
just
as
recently
as
last
week
there
was
a
senate
hearing
on
the
proposed
legislation.
it's
been
through
markup,
and
one
of
the
current
versions
being
proposed
right
now
is
that
it
may
be
extended
not
just
to
apply...
to
exclude
aviation
cases,
but
they
may
just
amend
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
to
make
it
more
generally
applicable.
however,
even
in
one
of
the
current
versions
there's
no
survival
provision
written
into
the
act.
rather,
what
they
would
do
is
just
allow
nonpecuniary
damages
under
the
wrongful
death
provisions
of
the
act
with
these
type
of
statutory
cap
on
them.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
if
it
converts
into
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
generally
lost
wages
would
not
be
recoverable.
what
you
would
recover
are...
is
loss
of
support
and
loss
of
inheritance,
and
then
when
you
combine
those
two
elements
of
damages,
you
in
effect
get
lost
wages
and
lost
future
earnings.
with
respect
to
medical
expenses
it's
kind
of
an
interesting
issue,
because...
justice
stevens
said,
why
hasn't
this
arisen
before.
well,
one
of
the
reasons
it
hasn't
arisen
before
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
these
dohsa-type
actions,
mostly
in
a
maritime
context,
there
are
usually...
there
is
usually
an
element
of
that
in
a
settlement
or
even
in
a
recovery,
because
medical
expenses
can
be
viewed
as
a
asset
of
the
estate,
so
if
a
decedent
had
$100,000
and
$20,000
had
to
go
to
pay
medical
expenses,
well,
you're
depleting
the
loss
of
inheritance
award,
so
that
way
they're
recoverable
as
part
of
the
loss
of
inheritance
award.
i
think
if
you
look
at
higginbotham,
in
note
20
of
higginbotham
they
talked
about
burial
expenses
and
whether
they're
recoverable,
and
it
makes
a
similar
type
of
analogy
as
to
burial
and
funeral
expenses.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
there
is
no
recovery,
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
with
respect
to
the
territorial
waters
the
courts
have
taken
two...
well,
the
courts
have
basically
taken
two
approaches.
before
the
calhoun
decision
some
courts
would
recognize
a
general
maritime
survival
action
applicable
to
the
territorial
waters
and
allow
recovery
that
way,
but
in
view
of
the
calhoun
decision
state
statutes
have
always
been
applicable
and
they
would
allow
recovery
under
the
applicable
state
statute
if
it
provided
a
survival
statute
with
respect
to
the
territorial
waters.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
yes.
you
would
be
able
to
recover
additional
damages
in
territorial
waters,
but
that's
a
legislative
scheme
that
exists
even
in
the
wrongful
death
case.
higginbotham
dealt
with
that
exact
situation
with
respect
to
loss
of
society
damages,
where
the
supreme
court,
the
court
in
gaudet
had
found
that
those
type
of
damages
are
recoverable
under
general
maritime
law,
but
when
it
came
to
higginbotham
the
court
said,
you
can't
get
those
under
general
maritime
law
in
a
dohsa
case,
because
congress
has
set
forth
what
type
of
damages
you
can
recover
and
they've
limited
those
damages
to
pecuniary
losses
only.
and
that's
where
we
get
to...
in
this
case
here,
there
isn't...
the
real
situation
here
is
the
issue
of
pecuniary
versus
nonpecuniary,
and
pre-death
pain
and
suffering
damages
are
not
pecuniary.
it
would
require
the
court
to
recognize
a
type
of
damages
not
allowed
by
dohsa,
to
add
the
estate
as
a
beneficiary,
which
is
not
included
in
dohsa.
in
1920,
congress
did
know
the
difference
between
a
wrongful
death
and
a
survival
action,
and
it
opted
to
adopt
basically
a
modified
type
of
wrongful
death
statute,
because
dohsa
is
not
just
like
lord
campbell's
act.
it
has
section
765,
which
is
a
little
different
from
lord
campbell's
act,
which
didn't
contain
such
a
provision,
and
i
think
when
you
look
back
to
1920,
what
was
congress
thinking
when
they
enacted
dohsa,
well,
i
think
the
language
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
was
very
clear.
with...
at
that
time,
they
thought
it
was
exclusive
because
there
was
no
other
action
out
there.
this
was
the
only
action
that
was
available
for
a
death
on
the
high
seas.
that's
where,
with
respect
to
this
preemption
issue
that
was
addressed
earlier,
in
this
context
you
have
federal
common
law,
and
there
is
a
different
preemption
analysis
than
you
do
apply
with
state
law.
when
you're
looking
at
state
law,
because
of
their
inherent
police
powers
you
have
to
see
an
affirmative
intent
to
preempt
that
state
statute,
but
with
respect...
when
congress
enacts
a
statute
and
the
preemption
is
of
federal
common
law,
the
analysis
really
is,
did
congress
speak
to
that
issue?
and
in
our
case
here,
did
congress
speak
to
the
issue
of
damages,
and
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
specifically
deals
with
that
issue
and
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
an
affirmative
prescription
of
federal
common
law
doesn't
arise
in
this
situation,
because
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
deals
with
this
issue.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
that's--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
with
respect,
with
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
i
don't
think
the
court
would
have
the
power,
because
it's
a
different
situation
than
the
situation
presented
in
moragne.
there
were
a
number
of
critical
factors
in
moragne
that
drove
that
decision.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
they
were
not
addressed,
but
when
you
go
back
to
the
moragne
case,
what
was
the
driving
force
in
moragne?
the
driving
force
in
moragne
was
not
a
recognition
of
damages.
it
was
a
recognition
of
a
cause
of
action
for
unseaworthiness--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--to
make
unseaworthiness
a
base
of
liability
uniform
within
the
class.
in
addition,
again,
as
your
honor
recognized,
moragne
dealt
with
an
issue
in
the
territorial
waters,
so
the
court
looked
to,
what
has
congress
enacted
for
territorial
waters,
and
they
withheld
the
remedy
of
dohsa
from
extending
into
territorial
waters,
so
there
was
a
gap
that
the
court
could
come
in
and
fill.
but
when
you
look
to
the
decisions
subsequent
to
moragne,
higginbotham,
miles,
and
zicherman,
we
look...
we
see
there
is
that
the
court
has
made
crystal
clear
that
when
congress
has
spoken
we
have
to
abide
by
what
congress
has
said,
and
congress
has
spoken
in
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
with
respect
to
pecuniary
damages.
and
to
take
the
argument
here
that
because
congress
then
specifically
say
we're
not
going
to
allow
loss
of
survival
damages,
then
any
time
congress
enacts,
they
don't
enact...
they
don't
legislate
for
the
entire
scheme,
so
there's
always
some
type
of
a
hole,
but
at
that
point
then
any
court
can
come
in
and
create
any
remedy
they
want.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well...
under
a
survival
act?
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
they--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
they
don't
get
off
scotfree,
because
there
is
still
the
wrongful
death
action,
but--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
then
the
beneficiaries
set
forth
in
dohsa
are
the
ones
closest
to
the
decedent,
so--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--you
have
the
parents,
spouse...
parents,
spouse,
and
children,
and
dependent
relatives,
so
anyone
who's
very
close
to
the
decedent,
even
a
niece
who
thinks
she
was
a
dependent
relative,
would
be
entitled
to
recover
under
dohsa
and,
of
course,
if
you
have
a
survival
action--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
even
the
state
law
statutes
draw
lines
as
to
who
can
recover
and--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--under
typical
state
statutes,
but
if
you
look
to
the
provisions
under
the
jones
act
and
fela
incorporated
by
reference,
it's
a
very
similar
scheme
to
dohsa--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--with
respect
to
the
estate
doesn't
recover,
the
personal
representative
recovers
on
behalf
of
certain
named--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--people,
and
it's
an
exclusory
class.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
no.
if
the
descent
and
distribution
laws
are...
if
they
were--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--someone
in
the
will
they
would
not
be...
if
they
weren't
named
in
the
will
they
would
not
be
able
to
recover
the
recovery
for
pain
and
suffering,
that's
correct,
but
again--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--with
respect
to...
for--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--no--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
that's--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
you
can
fill
in
that
hole,
but
you
have
to
work
within
what
congress--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
if
there
were
no
proper
dohsa
beneficiaries,
then
there--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
there
are
other
types
of...
you
can
recover
loss
of
support.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
i
respectfully
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
because
i
think
moragne
was
a
very
limited--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--if
the
court
has
the
power,
but
moragne
dealt
with
a
different
situation
than
when
you're
on
the
high
seas,
where
congress
has
legislated,
and
i
think
higginbotham
recognized
that.
even
moragne
recognized
the
supremacy
of
the
maritime
statutes.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
that's
correct.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
because
they
affirmatively
set
forth
what
they
decided
was
recoverable,
because
when
congress
was
enacting
dohsa
they
said
there
was
no
other
possible
action
for
a
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
there
was
no
general
maritime
law
action
at
that
time.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
exactly.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
i
think
when
you
look
to--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--well,
when
you
look
to
the
structure
of...
i'm
just
sticking
with
the
language
right
now
of
765,
what's
the
reason
for
765.
there,
they
said
if
there's
a
personal
injury
action
that
action
shall
be
so...
in
its
essence
cease
and
be
subsumed
in
the
dohsa
action.
now,
if
they
wanted
a...
if
they
want
to
allow
a
survival
type
of
action,
they
wouldn't
have
put
language
in
there.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
i...
well,
that's--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--it
is
pretty
clear
when
you
go
back.
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the
history
right
now,
but
if
you
look
through
the
records,
because
dohsa
was
a
compromise.
it
wasn't
just...
it
was
to
grant
a
remedy
where
none
existed
before,
but
there
were
also
interests
of
the
shipowners.
in
fact,
the
first
version
of
dohsa
had
a
$5,000
limit
on
recoverable
damages,
so...
and
that
was--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--the
difference
between
the
survival
provision
in
the
jones
act
and
most
state
statutes
is,
the
jones
act,
section
59,
sets
forth
that
there
is
a
survival...
this
is
the
1910
amendments,
when
they
added
the
survival
provision.
it
sets
forth
that
the
personal
representative
can
continue
any
personal
injury
action
the
decedent
had
but
for
the
benefit
of
certain
named
beneficiaries,
whereas
state
survival...
many
state
survival
statutes
says...
say
that
you...
the
personal
injury
action
of
the
decedent
shall
continue
and
will
be...
and
the
estate
recovers.
so
whereas
under
state
statutes
the
estate
itself,
being
a
fiction
where
the
decedent
recovers,
under
the
jones
act,
specific
beneficiaries
recover.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
well,
various...
state
statutes
vary.
it
depends
on
the
state,
but
here,
under
section
59
of
fela,
which
is
at
the...
in
the
back
of
our
brief
at
page
7,
it...
the
act
says
that
any
right
of
action
given
by
this
chapter
to
a
person
suffering
injuries
shall
survive
to
his
or
her
personal
representative
for
the
benefit
of
the
surviving
widow
or
husband
and
children
of
such
employee,
and
if
then
none...
if
none,
then
such
employee's
parents,
and
if
none,
then
the
next
of
kin
dependent
upon
the
employee,
so
it
sets
forth
exactly
who
recovers.
whereas
state
statutes,
the
recovery
goes
to
the
estate
and
it's
distributed
under
the
will.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
oh,
with
respect
to
the
damages
recoverable,
whatever
damages
would
be
recoverable
under
a
personal
injury
action,
so
pain
and
suffering
damages
are
recoverable
under
this,
your
honor.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
correct.
there
is
no
ceiling
on
that.
none
of
the
federal
statutes
currently
have
any
type
of
ceilings
on
the
types
of
recoverable
damages
as
to
monetary
caps.
when
you
look
to
dohsa
overall,
and
what
it
intended
to
do
from
1920
to
the
present
day,
dohsa
did
draw
certain
lines,
as
all
states
do,
and
these
lines
are
based
on
policy
decisions
made
by
the
legislature,
just
as
congress
today
is
considering
what
is
the
policy
they
should
have
for
a
death
on
the
high
seas
and
they're
considering
various
amendments
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
and
if
someone
can't
recover
under
the
applicable
statutes,
a
person
should
not
be
allowed
to
recover
under
judge-made
maritime
law.
we
have
to
stick
strictly
within
the
boundaries
set
forth
by
this
statute
and
by
congress,
because
the
role--
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
--the
measure
of
damages
is
general
maritime
law,
actually.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
it's
traditionally
recognized,
personal
injury
actions
for
injuries
on
the
high
seas.
mr.
andrew
j.
harakas
and
that
is
all
judge-made,
and
the
jones
act
does
deal...
the
jones
act
does
deal
with
personal
injuries,
but
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
does
not
deal
with
personal
injuries.
one
version
that
was
proposed
with
respect
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
would
have
made
dohsa
akin
to
fela,
and
would
have
allowed
further
recovery
of
personal
injuries,
but
that
was
soundly
defeated
in
1916,
and
what
we
have
today
is
the
version
that
currently
was
enacted
basically,
except
for
the
repeal
of
763
in
1980.
it's
the
same
version.
and
i
just
want
to
make
one
point
with
respect
to
763.
that
really
isn't
part
of
the...
763a.
that
isn't
part
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
that
is
a
statute
of
general
application
which
congress
enacted
in
1980
to
make
a
uniform
limitation
period
whether
in
actions
brought
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
maritime
law,
whether
it's
a
death
act
or
a
personal
injury
action,
and
it
was
