mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
submits
that
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
provides
the
exclusive
remedy
in
this
case,
and
i'd
like
to
explain
why.
congress
enacted
the
statute
in
response
to
this
court's
decision
in
the
harrisburg,
which
held
that
general
maritime
law
does
not
provide
a
remedy
for
persons
who
die
from
injuries
at
sea.
congress
legislated
with
the
understanding,
in
the
wake
of
the
harrisburg,
that
the
federal
statutory
regime
that
was
created
would
be
the
only
remedies
that
would
be
available
for
death
on
the
high
seas.
congress
considered
the
policy
question
of
appropriate
remedies
in
that
light,
and
it
struck
what
it
felt
was
the
proper
balance.
here,
as
in
mobil
oil
v.
higginbotham,
and
as
in
offshore
logistics
v.
tallentire,
this
court
should
not
supplement
the
statutory
wrongful
death
remedy
with
other
remedies
that
congress
did
not
provide.
we
think
that
course
would
be
inappropriate
here,
because
it
is
clear
from
the
text
and
the
legislative
history
that
congress
considered
the
possibility
of
a
survival
action
and
decided
not
to
provide
one.
the
most
instructive
provision
of
the
act
for
the
purposes
here
is
section
5.
that
section
recognizes
that
the
plaintiff
might
die
after
commencing
a
personal
injury
suit
for
activities
on
the
high
seas.
the
plight
of
an
injured
person
who
begins
a
suit,
but
dies
before
a
final
judgment
is
reached,
provides
an
especially
sympathetic
case
for
allowing
a
survival
remedy,
but
even
in
that
case,
congress
decided
that
only
a
wrongful
death
remedy
would
be
available.
congress
could
easily
have--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
is
correct,
yes.
now,
congress
could
have
easily
written
section
5
to
provide
a
survival
type
remedy,
but
it
made
a
legislative
choice
not
to
provide
that
type
of
remedy,
and
we
think
that
is
important
here,
that
congress
was
making
what
is
essentially
a
legislative
choice.
the
legislative
history
confirms--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
that
is...
well,
what
i
think
that
congress
was
attempting
to
do
here
is,
it
recognized
that
in
the
absence
of
section
5
the
personal
representatives
would
have
to
commence
a
new
suit,
and
what
they're
allowing
here
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and
they
will
just...
can
step
right
into
the
shoes
of
the
decedent--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--and
continue
on,
but
the
action
would
be
transformed
into
a
wrongful
death
remedy
for
the
particular
class
of
survivors.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
if
congress
had
omitted
that
section,
then
we
would
be
faced
with
the
question
of,
well,
what
did
congress
intend
to
prevent
this
type
of
cause
of
action,
and
i
think
the
argument
would
still
be
quite
clear
that
congress
did,
and
i
think
it's
the
legislative
history
that
we
would
then
turn
to
under
that
circumstance.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think
that
would
be
one
of
our
primary
sources.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
it
would
certainly
figure
more
prominently,
but
i
think
even
then
the
text
would
be
quite
helpful,
because
the
text
was
written
to
indicate
that
these
would
only
be
pecuniary
damages
that
would
be
provided,
and
here
we
are
seeking
a
different
type
of
remedy
that
would
not
have
been
available
in
1920.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
i--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes.
i
think
this
court
does
have
the
power
to
create
it.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
the
principal
thrust
of
our
position
here
is
that
this
is
a
legislative
choice,
that
the
question...
that
deciding
that
there's
a
survival
remedy
doesn't
put
an
end
to
the
number
of
questions
that
will
come
up.
there
will
still
be
questions
with
regard
to
who
should
that
survival
remedy
inure
to,
what
should
be
the
measure
of
damage,
how
would
it
be
reconciled
or
coordinated
with
the
wrongful
death--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--not
necessarily.
at
least
with
regard
to
the
coordination
of
the
wrongful
death
remedy
with
the
survival
remedy,
there
would
still
be
a
requirement.
here,
if
you're
allowing
both
of
those
remedies,
this
court
is
going
to
have
to
make
decisions
in
terms
of
what
remedies
are
compensable
under
each
of
those
two
different
causes
of
action,
and
where
there
might
be
an
overlap
between
the
type
of
remedy
that's
provided--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--so
there
will
be
some,
i
think...
some
additional
questions
that
would
come
up,
and
some
additional
complications.
now,
as
i
said,
i
think
the
legislative
history
here
makes
it
clear
that
congress
was
making
a
conscious
choice.
the
legislative
history,
both
the
reports
and
the
hearings,
indicate
that
congress
was
aware
of
the
difference
between
a
wrongful
death
action
and
a
survival
action.
furthermore,
congress
understood
that
the
statutory
remedy
here
would
be
exclusive,
and
congress
was
also
apparently
aware
of
this
court's
decision
in
michigan
v.
vreeland,
the
case
that
justice
ginsburg
alluded
to
earlier,
in
which
the
court
indicated
that
only
congress,
only
a
legislature
could
create
a
survival
remedy
and,
indeed,
as
has
already
been
discussed,
congress
has
created
those
types
of
survival
remedies
in
the
jones
act
and
also
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
but
congress
nevertheless
made
a
conscious
policy
decision
not
to
provide
a
survival
remedy
here,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
this
court
had
followed
what
was
traditionally
english
practice,
which
meant
that
there
was
an
action
for
maintenance
and
cure
for
seamen,
and
there
was
also
an
action
for
negligence,
general
negligence
for
passengers--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
i
think
it
probably--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--that
would
have
caught
it
by
surprise,
but
that
has
changed
now
with
moragne.
certainly
this
court
indicated
a
different
view
on
that
matter.
but
again,
that
was...
moragne
was
in
response
to
the
actions
of
state
legislatures,
and
here
i
think
it's
appropriate
for
this
court
to
defer
to
the
actions
of
congress
on
this
question.
as
i
said
before,
this
is
a
legislative
policy
issue
here,
and
congress--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--it's
my
understanding
that
the
house
bill
2005
did
pass
the
house,
and
that
would
have
simply
removed
aviation
claims
from
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes.
we'd
then
be
faced
with
a
choice-of-law
question
that
was
relatively
easy
after
zicherman,
where
this
court
simply
looked
to
the
question
of
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
that
we'd
then
be
faced,
in
warsaw
cases,
of
determining
what
is
the
appropriate
body
of
law.
most
likely
it
would
be
a
state,
or
perhaps
a
foreign
cause
of
action.
there
is
action
pending
in
the
senate,
but
i
don't
believe
that
anything
has
passed
the
senate
at
this
point,
and
i
believe
the
provisions
are
different
from
the
house
bill.
now,
as
i've
said,
i
think
that
the
court
cannot
take
action
in
this
case
in
providing
a
survival
remedy
without
overruling,
or
at
least
overriding
the
judgment
that
congress
made
in
1920.
perhaps
that
judgment
should
be
changed,
but
perhaps
not,
but
that's
a
decision,
we
believe,
that
is
for
congress.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
