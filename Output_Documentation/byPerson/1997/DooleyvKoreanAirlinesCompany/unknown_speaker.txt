unknown
speaker
the
case,
of
course,
since
it
does
survive...
involve
the
survivor's
action,
could
mean
much
more
than
that.
there
would
be
other
cases
in
which
people
would
linger
for
years
with
substantial
injuries,
et
cetera.
unknown
speaker
ms.
madole,
i
think
that
the
court
is
generally
familiar
with
the
difference
between
a
wrongful
death
act
and
a
survival
act,
and
getting
down
to
the
nub
of
your
problem,
as
i
understand
it
the
fela
originally
did
not
have
any
survival
aspect
to
it,
and
this
court
declined
to
create
such
a
claim.
it
left
it
to
congress
and
congress
took
care
of
it.
why
shouldn't
we
follow
the
same
pattern
here?
unknown
speaker
but
am
i
wrong
in
thinking
that
there
was
an
attempt,
before
that
amendment,
to
get
the
courts
to
recognize
a
survival
claim
for
railroad
workers?
unknown
speaker
and
wasn't
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act...
that
wasn't
modeled
on
lord
campbell's
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
consider
it
significant
that
congress
was
aware
of
survival
provisions
under
the
federal
employers
liability
act
and
it
did
not
incorporate
them
here?
i
mean,
that's
a
significant
fact
in
the
case,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
congress
did,
in
42
u.s.
code
section
765,
deal
with
death
of
a
plaintiff
and
what's
recoverable,
so
to
that
extent
congress
certainly
addressed
the
subject.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
that
congress
was
entirely
silent
on
what
would
happen
to
the
claims
of
pre-death
injuries
because
in
765,
if
i'm
reading
it
rightly,
it
converts
the
pre-existing
action
for
pre-death
injuries
solely
into
the
kind
of
death
claim
that
is
allowed
under
the
statute,
and
that
sounds
to
me
as
though
it's
saying,
everything
except
the
claim
allowed
under
this
statute
goes
away.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that's
all
it
wanted
to
do,
i
would
have
thought
that
in
765
it
would
have
said
a
wrongful
death
action
may
be
added
to
the
pre-existing
personal
injury
action
of...
that
the
decedent
had
begun,
and
it
didn't
do
that.
it
in
effect
said,
it
gets
metamorphosed
into
a
wrongful
death
case,
period.
unknown
speaker
but
we
deal
with
what
congress
wrote,
not
with
what
someone
thinks
congress
was
trying
to
effectuate.
i
mean,
i
think
you
have
to
deal
with
the
language
of
765
and
you
deduce
what
congress
intended
from
the
language
of
765.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
we
get
into
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
i
say,
why
do
we
get
into
legis--
unknown
speaker
--does
that
apply
to
causes
of
action
under
than
those...
other
than
those
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act?
doesn't
it
cover
jones
act
or
other
causes
of
action,
which
might
well
explain
that
language?
unknown
speaker
under
the
jones
act,
which
picks
up
on
the
fela,
there
is
both
wrongful
death
relief
and
survival
that's
rather
circumscribed.
given
that
congress
has
done
it
all,
both
the
fela
and,
borrowing
from
the
fela,
the
jones
act,
why
should
the
court
say,
well,
it's
our
job
to
fill
in
the
survival
act
in
this
dohsa,
death
on
the
high
seas
act
legislation?
unknown
speaker
but
one
can
argue
equally
well,
and
i
think
perhaps
better,
that
congress
has
addressed
itself
to
this
question.
it
has
decided
what
sort
of
damages
will
be
recoverable
for
death
on
the
high
seas,
and
there
isn't
any
void
because
what
congress
has
not
granted,
it
withheld.
unknown
speaker
what's
your
authority
for
that
proposition?
unknown
speaker
that
you
just
stated.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
preemption
principles
as
you
describe
them,
where
congress
has
addressed
one
particular
subject,
it
doesn't
prevent
the
courts
from
developing
common
law
policies
that
may
be
contrary
to
that
in
a
related
area.
at
least
that's
how
i
took
your
proposition
to
be.
unknown
speaker
are
you
talking
about
preemption
of
state
laws,
or--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
the
closest
case
you
have
to
support
the
proposition
we're
talking
about
now?
i
realize
you
say
they're
in
the
reply
brief,
but
tell
me
what
case
you
would
choose?
unknown
speaker
medtronics?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
preemption
of
state
law.
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
know,
congress
passes...
common
law
doesn't
exist
by
itself.
it
exists
under
the
aegis
of
either
state
or
the
federal
government,
and
as
i
recall
medtronics,
the
court
is
talking
there
about
what
sort
of
state
law
claims
are
not
preempted
by
a
federal
statute,
but
that
isn't
the
inquiry
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
not
a
species
of
common
law
under
the
aegis
of
a
state.
in
other
words,
we
may
have
definite
reservations
about
how
inclusive
to
read
a
federal
statute
as
preempting
state
law,
but
i
don't
think
any
case
you've
cited
so
far
says
those
same
reservations
based
essentially
on
the
traditional
federal
system
of
government
we
have,
with
respect
for
states,
would
carry
over
into
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
as
opposed
to
federal
remedies
devised
by
courts.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but--
unknown
speaker
--go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
ms.
madole,
let's
assume
we
grant
that.
all
it
establishes
is
that
we
may.
but
why
should
we?
i
mean,
there
has
been
no
such
cause
of
action.
we've
not
recognized
it
in
the
past,
and
in
the
past,
where
we
have
created
new...
you
say
common
law
maritime
causes
of
action,
we've
done
it
in
areas
where
congress
has
not
displayed
any
interest
in
bringing
its
intelligence
to
bear
upon
the
matter.
here,
congress
has
been
active.
i
mean,
if
times
have
changed...
you
said
in
light
of
changed
circumstances.
it
seems
to
me,
if
there
are
any
changed
circumstances
it
is
that
congress
has
displayed
a
much
more
lively
interest
in
these
matters
than
it
did
in
previous
times,
so
gee,
if
we
didn't
take
the
initiative
ourselves
in
earlier
times,
there's
even
less
reason
to
do
so
today,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
i'm
giving
you
that.
let's...
we
have
the
capacity.
why
should
we
use
that
capacity?
unknown
speaker
that
person's...
he's
gone.
he's
dead
and
gone.
i
mean,
so
long
as
the
survivors
are...
they
have
a
cause
of
action
under
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
if
he
has
begun
a
suit
and
dies
before
the
suit
is
completed.
unknown
speaker
but
ms....
may
i
just
ask
you
a
question
about
that?
that's
a
very
appealing
argument,
because
it
seems
most
unjust
that
a
person
suffers
extensive
harm,
hospital
expense
and
the
rest,
in
the
period
between
the...
when
the
injury
occurs
and
when
the
person
ultimately
dies
before
a
verdict
comes
in.
but
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is,
that
must
have
happened
many,
many
times.
we're
talking
a
huge
area,
all
the
deaths...
all
the
injuries
on
the
high
seas
that
caused
deaths
that
occurred
while
a
case
was
still
pending,
and
yet
we
don't
have
any
such
cases.
i
mean,
this
is
kind
of
late
in
the
day,
and
i'm
just
puzzled
as
to
why
that
issue
hasn't
arisen
before.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
of
any
case
that
points
out
that
fact
pattern.
are
there
some?
unknown
speaker
in
a
what?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i'm
sure
it
happens
a
lot,
but
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is,
why
is
it
1998...
this
statute's
been
on
the
books
since
1920.
why
are
we
suddenly
confronted
with
this
problem
at
this
stage
of
the
proceedings?
i
mean,
this
stage
of
our
history,
is
what
i
meant.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
most
survival
actions
are
justified
by
statutes
that
authorize
survival
of
common
law
claims,
i
believe
just
as
lord
campbell's
act
took
care
of
the
death
action.
unknown
speaker
ms.
madole,
do
i
understand
that
congress
is
now
considering
a
bill
that
would
take
aviation
tragedies
out
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act
and
have
another
regime
for
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
are
we
supposed
to
about
higginbotham?
that
is,
higginbotham
seems
to
support
you
in
that
it
says
admiralty
courts
have
often
been
called
upon
to
supplement
maritime
statutes,
but
then
the
next
sentence
is,
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
however,
announces
congress'
considered
judgment
on
such
issues
as
beneficiaries,
et
cetera,
survival
damages,
and
then
it
says
the
act...
the
courts
are
not
free
to
supplement
where
congress
acts,
where
congress
addresses
those
questions,
so
hasn't
this
issue...
why
doesn't
it
decide
the
issue?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
what
you're
doing...
the
bite
of
what
you
do
is,
it
provides
a
somewhat
different
class
of
beneficiaries
when
a
person
dies,
and
it
provides
the
whole
of
the
beneficiaries
with
more
money,
so
it
seems
to
speak
to
both
who
the
beneficiaries
are
and
what
the
damages
are
in
respect
to
the
harm
caused
when
a
person
dies.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand
that
they're
different
remedies.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
higginbotham
relevant?
unknown
speaker
you're
assuming
more
knowledge
of
higginbotham
than
i
have.
the
reason
that
the
sentence
i
just
read
you
is
not
determinative
in
your
case
is
because--
unknown
speaker
--ms.
madole,
may
i
ask
if
you
would
complete
what
you
were
explaining
to
me
about
what
congress
is
doing
about
it
now?
as
i
understand
it,
congress
knows
about
the
existence
of
this
problem
and
the
proposed
legislation
would
do
what?
what
is
the
proposed
legislation,
and
if
it
passed,
how
would
this
case
be
handled?
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
the
solution?
unknown
speaker
and
put
them
under
what?
unknown
speaker
picking
up
on
state
law,
is
that
what
it
would
do?
i
mean,
what
body
of
law?
unknown
speaker
so
it
would
not
be
the...
creating
a
new
counterpart
to
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act,
only
more
general.
it
would
be
picking
up
some
law
that
is,
and
it
would
be
a
state
law,
is
that--
unknown
speaker
under
the
present
law,
if
a
victim
lingers,
say,
for
a
year
and
has
medical
expenses
and
lost
wages,
are
those
pecuniary
losses
recoverable
when
it
converts
into
a
death
on
the
high
seas
act
action,
or
into
a
wrongful
death
action?
unknown
speaker
but
for
pain
and
suffering
for
the
decedent,
who
might
have
lingered
several
years,
you
say
there
is
no
recovery.
unknown
speaker
now,
what's
the
situation
in
territorial
waters,
where
death
on
the
high
seas
act
presumably
doesn't
govern?
unknown
speaker
so
the
recovery
would
be
substantially
different,
depending
on
whether
it's...
the
death
occurs
from
the
accident
on
the
high
seas
or
in
territorial
waters.
unknown
speaker
but
one
can
argue
that
the
analysis
in
moragne
was
partly
based
on
when
there's
a
hole
in
the
law
on
the
high
seas,
and
when
the
universal
judgment
of
state
legislatures
all
over
the
country
have
changed
from
what
it
used
to
be
on
the
death
act,
that
with
regard
to
survival,
the
same
thing
happened.
there
used
to
be
no
survival
at
common
law
and
all
of
the
state
legislatures
have
now
said
there'll
be
survival,
and
therefore
if
we
wanted
to
be
just
as
creative
as
the
court
was
in
moragne,
we
would
have
authority
to
do
the
same
thing
with
regard
to
a
survival
action,
which
is
not
squarely
covered.
arguably
it's
covered
by
that
one
section,
by
dohsa.
unknown
speaker
so
at
least
we'd
have
the
power
to
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
moragne,
of
course,
was
geographically
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute,
but
the
counterargument
we
hear
in
a
legal
category
sense,
survival
actions,
are...
or
preexisting
common
law
actions
by
the
injured
party
himself
or
herself
are
outside
the
scope
of
the
statute,
too.
they
just
weren't
addressed,
except
in
the
one
section
that
you
talked
about.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
the
prohibition
against
pecuniary...
i
mean,
the
limitation
on
pecuniary
damages
doesn't
entirely
solve
the
problem,
because
you
can
have
a
decedent
whose
beneficiaries
are
not
among
the
people
who
are
entitled
to
sue
under
dohsa.
they
can
be
second
cousins,
or
friends,
or
something
like
that,
and
they
lose
whatever
benefit
the
estate
would
have
from
the
recovery.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
see,
there's
no...
if
there's
no
survival
statute,
those...
the
defendant
just
gets
off
scot-free
on
that.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
wrongful
death
action
under
dohsa,
as
i
say,
is
limited
to
a
specific
category
of
plaintiffs,
and
i'm
assuming
an
estate
where
none
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
estate
are
within
that
category.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
understand,
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
agree
it
covers
most
of
the
cases,
but
there
are
cases
where
the
beneficiary
under
the
will
might
be
not
a
dependent
but
just
a
friend,
or
an
associate
of
some
kind.
that
person
would
get
nothing,
whereas
if
there
were
a
survival
statute
he
would.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
not
the
survival
statute.
the
estate
gets
the
money.
unknown
speaker
and
whoever
will
participate
in
the
estate
would
share
in
the
recovery.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
obvious
group
is
grandchildren.
i
mean,
imagine
grandchildren.
there's
an
accident,
older
people
die,
they
all
had
some
estate,
they
left
it
all
to
their
grandchildren.
maybe
even
there
was
lingering
and
so
forth.
in
that
case,
nobody
could
recover.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
they
wouldn't
recover
anything,
i
mean,
because
there's
nobody
who
has
anything
in
a
case
where
the...
i
mean,
what
could
they
recover
for?
there's
no
dependency,
they're
older
people,
the
beneficiaries
of
the
estate
are
grandchildren,
there's
no
lawsuit.
nobody
brings
a
lawsuit.
who
could
bring
one?
unknown
speaker
to
the
death
of
the
person...
i
mean,
imagine
any
kind
of
awful
case
you
want,
but
i
mean,
you
know,
the
terrible
suffering
or
whatever,
or
people
linger
for
a
long
time,
the
medical
bills
eat
up
the
whole
estate...
i
mean,
i
could
go
on
if
you
want,
but--
unknown
speaker
--the
point
is
that
then
there's
no
money
left
and
the
grandchild
who
was
going
to
get
the
money
has
no
lawsuit
and
no
money,
and
nothing.
unknown
speaker
so
they're
saying
you
should
fill
in
that
hole.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
am
i
right
about
the
facts?
is
it...
am
i
right
about
the
assumption?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
about
the
assumption
that
in
such
a
circumstance
nobody...
it's...
nobody
would
get
any--
unknown
speaker
--there
are,
but
they
didn't
suffer
any
harm,
because
you
see,
they
weren't
left
any
of
the
money.
unknown
speaker
no...
they...
all
right.
no,
no,
you're
right,
if
there
was
the
harm,
so
i...
assume
that
out.
this
court
has
the
power
to
supplement,
presumably,
because
of
moragne.
unknown
speaker
well,
even
higginbotham
said
that
the
court
has
the
power.
unknown
speaker
so
in
order
to
distinguish
it
you'd
have
to
draw
a
negative
assumption
from
the
enactment
of
the
death
on
the
high
seas
act.
you'd
have
to
assume
congress...
which
you
argue,
that
congress
didn't
want
it
supplemented.
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
that
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
it
supplemented
is?
unknown
speaker
exactly,
so
they're
operating
against
an
environment
where
nobody
gets
a
penny.
unknown
speaker
so
they
say,
hey,
nobody
gets
a
penny,
now
we're
going
to
give
a
few
pennies
to
a
few
people,
so
what
is
it
that
suggests
that
they
wouldn't
have
wanted
more
pennies
to
go
to
some
other
people?
unknown
speaker
if
everything
changed.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
congress
wasn't
all
that
crazy
about
awarding
noneconomic
damages.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
pretty
clear
that's
the
way
they
felt
in
1920.
unknown
speaker
what
is
in
the
jones
act...
picking
up
on
the
fela,
what
is
the
survival
feature
of
that
act,
and
how
does
it
compare
with
state
legislation?
unknown
speaker
that's
who
recovers.
now,
what
can
be
recovered?
is
there
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
you
haven't
told
me
anything
about
what
is
recoverable.
that
doesn't
sound
like
it's
limiting
the--
unknown
speaker
--without
any
ceiling?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
that
will
kind
of
reveal
my
ignorance,
but
supposing
you
have
a
slip-and-fall
case
on
an
ocean
liner
out
in
the
middle
of
the
atlantic
ocean
and
they
come
back
and
sue,
what
law
governs
the
measure
of
damages?
unknown
speaker
generally
maritime
law.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
all
judge-made,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
the
general
description
of
the
causes
of
action
that
763a
pertains
to?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
to
be
on
the
ocean?
unknown
speaker
any
time
there's
maritime--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
harakas.
unknown
speaker
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
so
the
personal
representative
sues,
but
the
beneficiaries
are
those
named
in
dohsa?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
to
your
opponent's
argument
that
at
least
you
can
explain
that
provision
as
a
way
of
saving
an
action
that
otherwise
would
not
exist.
unknown
speaker
and
it
might
be
barred
by
limitations.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
how
you'd
decide
this
case
if
congress
had
omitted
section
5
from
dohsa?
unknown
speaker
you'd
have
to
rely
on
legislative
history,
then.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
where...
your
opponent's
seeking
the
kind
of
remedy
the
court
created,
in
effect,
in
moragne,
and
everybody
seems
to
agree
we
have
the
power
to
create
such
a
remedy
here--
unknown
speaker
--if
we
think
it
is
not
inconsistent
with
any
congressional
direction.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
all
the
same
kind
of
questions
we
get
if
the
plaintiff
doesn't
die,
if
it's
a
slip-and-fall
case.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
was
congress
aware...
at
that
time,
had
federal
courts
created
new
tort
remedies
in
admiralty
law,
or
tort-like
remedies
on
their
own
at
all?
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
driving
at
is,
would
congress
at
that
time
also
have
been
aware
of
the
possibility
that
federal
admiralty
courts
could
create
remedies?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
and
can
you
enlighten...
give
us
any
more
enlightenment
than
we've
already
had
from
counsel
on
legislative
policy?
what
is
the
current
thinking
about
what
to
do
with
air
crashes?
unknown
speaker
left
it
all
to
state
law,
then,
and
moragne-type--
