chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
97-174,
cass
county,
minnesota
v.
leech
lake
band
of
chippewa
indians.
mr.
maus,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
close
is
cass
county
to
the
twin
cities?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
your
time?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
mr.
schoessler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
goudy
v.
meath
also
has
a
long
and,
i
suspect,
equally
honorable...
and
it
seems
to
me
if
goudy
v.
meath
controls
in
this
case,
you
lose.
maybe
you
can
see
a
way
to
distinguish
it.
i
can't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
all
means,
yes.
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
go
back
a
minute,
mr.
schoessler,
to
your
comment
about
the
indian
nonintercourse
act.
it
seems
to
me
if
we
held
that
to
mean
what
you
and
the
government
say
it
should
mean
here
that
a
tribe
today
or
tomorrow
seeking
to
convey
land
in
a
business
transaction
is
up
against
a
very
real
burden.
how
would
a
tribe
that
wished
to
convey
some
land
that
it
owned
today
go
about
it
if
the
indian
intercourse
act
means
what
you
say
it
means?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
would--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
that
would
take
an
amendment
by
congress,
i
take
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--of
the
indian
intercourse
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
you're
right
about
the
intercourse
act,
it
isn't
just
a
question
of
the
secretary
of
interior
approving
a
conveyance.
it's
a...
it
has
to
be
done
either
pursuant
to
treaty
or
convention,
so
that
some
administrative
approval
in
the
interior
department
isn't
going
to
help
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
they
weren't
taken
away,
they
were
conveyed
away,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
by
voluntary
transaction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
schoessler.
ms.
mcdowell,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
mr.
maus,
do
you
have
rebuttal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
good.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
maus.
the
case
is
submitted.
