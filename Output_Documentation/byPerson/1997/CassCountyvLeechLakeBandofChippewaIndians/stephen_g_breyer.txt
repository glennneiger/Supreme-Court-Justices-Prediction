why...
what...
is
this...
it
seems
to
me
if
we're
talking
about
these
particular
parcels,
they're
the
same
as
any
other
parcels
that
have
been
out
there,
occupied
and
owned
by
people
who
are
not
indians
in
fee
simple.
there
could
be
many
such
parcels,
and
it
could
have
ended
up
in
the
hands
of
non
indians
for
many
such...
many
reasons.
and
so
one
day
a
tribe
comes
along
and
buys
a
parcel
of
land
that
previously
didn't
belong
to
the
tribe,
on
the
reservation,
and
isn't
the
issue
whether,
once
the
tribe
acquires
that,
whether
it
ever...
whatever
it
is,
it's
in
the
reservation.
they
bought
it.
now,
is
it
taxable
or
not?
and
if
the
principle
is,
well,
it's
not
taxable
only
because
it's
in
the
tribe's
hands,
however
it
got
there,
unless
congress
clearly
says
so,
where
did
congress
clearly
say
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue.
the
issue...
that's
an
issue
of
what
happens
when
the
tribe
owns
the
land
and
gets
rid
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
not
our
issue.
our
issue
is,
there's
some
land
out
there
that
doesn't
belong
to
the
tribe.
we
don't
care
how
or
why
it
doesn't
belong
to
the
tribe.
it
doesn't.
now,
the
tribe
acquires
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
once
it's
acquired,
is
it
now
no
longer
taxable,
and
if
the
principle
is,
it's
no...
not
taxable
once
it's
in
the
hands
of
the
tribe,
however
it
got
there,
unless
congress
clearly
says
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
did
congress
clearly
say
so?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
of
course,
then
they
have
the
trust
thing
you
were
talking
about.
so,
why
do
they
need
the
trust
thing
if
they're
not
taxable
in...
i
mean,
you
know,
if
it
isn't
nontaxable
once
they
reacquire
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
we
did
distinguish
goudy
along
the
lines
you
suggest,
or
said
it
doesn't
really
apply
any
more,
what
would
prevent
an
indian
tribe
from
buying
5
acres
of
downtown
minneapolis
and
setting
up
some
hotels,
restaurants,
and
various
other
things
and
saying,
all
right,
yes,
they're
casinos,
and
saying
we're
immune
from
taxation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
i
mean,
you've
now...
where
did
that
come
from?
i
mean,
why
suddenly
is
it
so
inherently
absolutely
clear
that
congress
wanted
to
permit
minneapolis
to
tax
the
casino
owned
by
the
tribe
but
not
indisputably
absolutely
clear
that
congress
wanted
cass
county
to
tax
the
five
alienable
acres
owned
by
the
tribe
on
the
reservation?
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see
where
you're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
see
where
you're
going,
so
let
me
then,
ask
you,
is
it,
although
in
this
case
quite
clear
what's
on
a
reservation
and
what
isn't
on
a
reservation,
it
seems
to
me
we've
had
quite
a
few
cases
where
that's
not
at
all
clear,
and
how
will
we
manage
that
kind
of
distinction,
which
is
another
one
you
tried
to
draw,
where
we
have
indian
tribes
in
alaska
or
other
places
where
there
is
a
lot
of
dispute
as
to
what
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
are?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
going
to
be
with
us
if
the
rule
is
alienability
means
taxability.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
understand
it,
there
is
an
out,
which
you
wouldn't
like,
but
it
prevents
downtown
minneapolis
from
becoming
inalienable,
and
that
is
that
the
indian
nonintercourse
act
only
applies
to
lands
that
have
not
been
sold
in
fee
simple
and
thereby
become
alienable,
but
if
the
tribe
reacquires
land
like
that,
well,
it
remains
alienable,
and
that
kind
of
interpretation
applies
on
reservation
and
off
reservation,
et
cetera.
if
you
accept
that,
you
don't
get
into
this
problem
of
downtown
minneapolis,
but
of
course,
then,
if
you
also
accept
taxation
follows
alienability,
it
means
that
this
land
would
be
taxable.
that's
a
long
question.
i'm
sorry.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
you
possibly
just
quickly
say
what
your
view
is
on
the
question
of,
if
you
followed
goudy
and
followed
the
rule,
taxability
follows
alienability,
you'd
have
to
get
to
the
question,
is
this
alienable,
and
then
we'd
get
to
the
nonintercourse
act,
et
cetera?
what's
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
downtown
minneapolis
alienable?
