mr.
james
m.
schoessler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
as
a
preliminary
matter
i'd
like
to
address
a
question
that
was
raised
about
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
25
u.s.c.
section
465,
which
is
the
section
that
allows
the
united
states
government
to
take
land
into
trust
for
indian
tribes.
i
think
there
was
an
implication
made
to
the
court
that
that
section
somehow
granted
taxing
jurisdiction
to
states
and
counties
over
land
by
negative
implication.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
yes.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
it's
basically
a
negative
implication,
to
which
i
think
two
responses
are
required.
the
first
one
probably
is
that
that
kind
of
a
negative
implication
would
be
completely
antithetical
to
the
philosophy
that
was
behind
the
adoption
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
the
promotion
of
tribal
independence
and
self
sufficiency
that
forms
the
basis
of
the
act
and
the
rebuilding
of
the
reservation
land
base
that,
at
least
partially,
that
act
was
all
about.
the
second
thing
i
would
point
out
is
that,
in
fact,
this
court
has
addressed
the
negative
implication
question
in
the
past
in
a
decision
that
was
issued
in
1973,
mescalero
apache
tribe
v.
jones.
the
court
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
legislative
history
and
the
wording
of
the
trust
provisions
of
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
the
court
there
specifically
said
that
there
was
nothing
in
that
act
or
its
history
which
indicated
an
intent
on
the
part
of
congress
to
remove
the
traditional
tax
exemptions
that
tribes
had
within
reservations.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
yes,
your
honor--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--the
point
that
i
was
simply
making
is
that
there
is
no
authority
within
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
section
465
to
find
a
grant
of
jurisdiction,
even
by
negative
implication
to
counties
or
states
to
tax
tribal
lands.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
it
does
bring
up,
i
think,
what
the
basic
point
of
this
case
is
anyway,
and
the
basic
rule
of
law
that
should
govern
this
case.
it's
a
rule
of
law
that
even
the
county
agrees
with.
it's
not
disputed.
it
was
cited
as
authoritative
by
the
county,
and
it's
well
known
to
this
court.
it's
the
unmistakably
clear
intent
rule,
what's
called
the
per
se
rule,
against
taxation
of
indians
and
tribes
in
indian
country.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
unmistakably
clear
intent
rule,
or
the
per
se
rule,
if
you
will,
has
a
long
and
honorable
history
in
this
country's
jurisprudence.
it's
about
150
years
old.
it
has
been--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--give
me
an
opportunity
to
do
that
now,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
i
would
like
to
talk
about
goudy
v.
meath--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--because,
after
all,
it
is
probably
the
foundation
of
the
county's
argument
here.
it's
the
case
which
the
county
asserts
set
forth
an
alienability
equals
taxability
rule,
and
i'd
like
to
make
a
few
observations
about
that
case.
number
1,
the
unmistakably
clear
intent
rule
was
even
at
that
time
a
fairly
longstanding
principle
in
the
law
going
back
to
the
kansas
indians
and
probably
russo
v.
georgia
for
that
matter,
so
the
goudy
court
was
well
aware
of
that
principle.
the
goudy
opinion,
it
seems
to
us
just
on
the
face
of
it,
is
a
somewhat
odd
decision
on
which
to
base
a
fairly
major
shift
from
that
per
se
rule
against
taxation.
the
opinion
itself
was
only
two
pages
long.
there
was
a
one
page
statement
of
facts
and
a
less
than
one
page
opinion
by
justice
brewer.
the
opinion
does
not
examine
in
detail
prior
indian
law
precedent
relating
to
jurisdictional
matters.
the
opinion
does
not
seem
to
indicate
that
new
indian
law
ground
is
being
plowed,
or
is
intended
to
be
plowed
in
that
short
opinion,
and
there's
no
indication,
it
seems
to
us,
that
the
court
is
clearly
establishing
a
new
generic
rule
of
law
that
says
alienability
equals
taxability.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
i
think
the
court
in
goudy
did
not
address
or
consider
the
indian
nonintercourse
act
and
i
think
it
was
for
this
reason,
and
it's
probably
i
think
the
most
critical
factor
in
goudy
and
perhaps
one
of
the
more
misunderstood
factors
in
goudy,
and
that
is
the
fact
that
the
goudy
court
treated
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
james
goudy,
not
as
an
indian
but
as
a
non
indian
citizen.
it
was
stipulated
to
in
that
case
that
goudy
was
to
be
treated
as
a
non
indian
citizen.
that
was
referred
to
by
the
court
and
i
think
it
was
terribly
important
to
the
decision
in
that
case.
it
was
terribly
important
because
it
reversed
presumptions.
as
a
non
indian
citizen
goudy
was
presumed
already
to
be
subject
to
state
law
unless
he
could
show
an
express
federal
exemption
from
that
law.
if
he
were
treated
as
an
indian,
he
would
have
been
presumed
protected
from
state
jurisdiction
unless
the
county
could
have
shown
an
unmistakably
clear
delegation
of
authority
over
him.
what
the
goudy
court
did
is
rule
on
the
exemption
question.
it
ruled
that
james
goudy
could
not
demonstrate
an
unmistakably
clear
exemption
from
the
taxation
that
was
presumed
valid
over
him
as
a
non
indian
citizen.
the
court
did
not
decide
and
declare
that
the
alienability
of
his
land
provided
the
jurisdiction
over
him.
that
jurisdiction
already
existed
because
he
was
a
non
indian
citizen
within
the
boundaries
of
the
state.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
then
i
think,
your
honor,
you
have
the
on
reservation
off
reservation--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--your
honor,
to
answer
that
i
think
you
have
to
go
back
basically
to
the
foundations
of
the
country
and
the
beginning
of
the
per
se
rule
against
taxation
of
indians--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--indian
reservations.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
that
kind
of
a
distinction
goes
far
beyond
the
taxation
questions
in
this
case,
and
frankly
it's
always
going
to
be
with
us
in
the
context
of
the--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--if
the
rule
turns
out
to
be
alienability
equals
taxability,
what
has
been
said
essentially
is
that
the
only
land
or
property
on
reservations
that
is
exempt
from
state
jurisdiction
is
trust
property,
property
actually
owned
by
the
united
states
in
trust
for
individual
indians
or
tribes.
that...
excuse
me.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
your
honor,
we
certainly
do
argue
that,
but
our
most
serious
concern
is
the
alienability
equals
taxability
rule.
certainly
the
nonintercourse
act
we
believe
would
prevent
the
lands
from
being
taxed
if
there
was
such
a
rule
in
this
country's
jurisprudence,
so
we
seriously
argue
about
the
validity
of
the
rule
itself,
and
that's
our
primary
concern.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
yes,
that's
correct.
the
other
point
that
i
would
make
about
that
is
by
adopting
such
a
rule
you
have
essentially
de
facto
disestablished
reservations,
because
the
rule
of
indian
country
generally
is,
as
you
well
know,
is
that
state
jurisdiction
is
limited
in
indian
country.
it's
limited
over
both
indians
and
tribes
within
indian
country.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
mr.
chief
justice,
you're
correct,
it
does,
in
fact,
impose
a
burden
on
the
potential
transfer
of
lands
that
are
purchased
in
fee
by
indian
tribes.
we
understand
that,
and
we
would
hope
that
if
not
now,
in
the
future,
rules
for
allowing
such
transfer
under
perhaps
more
flexible
circumstances
than
exist
now
for
allowing
transfers
of
trust
lands
would
be
developed
and
the
tribes
could
obtain
that
permission.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
we
understand
it's
a
two
edged
sword.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
yes,
it
would.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
your
honor,
two
points
on
that.
number
1,
we
still
have
to
maintain
the
distinction
between
on
reservation
and
off
reservation.
it
certainly
would
not
allow
the
tribes
to
go
off
reservation,
purchase
land--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--and
then
essentially
say
they're
not
taxable.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
the
nonintercourse
act
would
prevent
conveyance
of
lands
that
were
purchased
off
reservation
but
not
necessarily
the
taxability
of
those
lands.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
i
would
base
it
actually
on
the
plain
wording
of
the
act.
the
wording
of
the
act
does
not
talk
about
taxation.
the
wording
of
the
act
talks
about
conveyance,
and
i
think
there
is
nothing
that
is
necessarily
mutually
exclusive
or
improper
about
a
piece
of
land
being
purchased
off
reservation
that
the
united
states
would
not
allow
to
be
conveyed
without
its
approval
as
differentiated
from
land
being
purchased
off
the
reservation
that
might
be
taxable.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
your
honor,
unless
congress
passed
a
procedure
which
allowed
that
to
happen.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
which
is
what
we
presume
would
occur
in
that
kind
of
instance.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
it
is...
your
honor,
it's
only
been
very
recently
that
tribes
have
been
in
any
sort
of
position
to
attempt
to
rebuild
their
tribal
land
bases
on
their
own
reservations.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
your
honor,
you're
referring
to
the
indian
nonintercourse
act
implications?
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
if
my
recollection
is
correct
and
it...
i
believe
it
is,
the
original
versions
of
the
indian
nonintercourse
act
included
language
relating
to
individual
indians,
the
last
version
did
not,
so
the
nonintercourse
act
as
it
reads
now
only
applies
to
tribes,
to
tribal
lands,
not
individual
lands.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
your
honor,
except
for
the
proposition
that
congress
established
a
procedure
to
allow
that
to
happen.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
authorized
later
by
act
of
congress
when
it
passed
the
indian
non...
or
the
indian
reorganization
act
and
provided
for
repurchases
of
tribal
land
base--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--you're
correct,
your
honor,
in
terms
of...
in
terms
of
the
purchases
of
land,
as
opposed
to
the
conveyancing
away
of
land.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
the
purchase
of
land
has
really
only
become
an
issue
probably
in
the
last
couple
of
decades
as
tribal
governments
have
built
themselves
up
enough
to
actually
consider
being
able
to
rebuild
some
of
their
tribal
land
bases.
those
land
bases
were
devastated
during
the
allotment
era.
the
leech
lake
reservation
is
an
example
of
that,
where
over
90
percent
of
the
land,
95
percent
of
the
land
was
lost
to
indians
and
the
tribe
during
the
allotment
era.
the
whole
thrust
of
current...
of
the
current
attempts
are
for
the
tribes
to
attempt
to
rebuild
some
of
their
reservations
that
were
taken
away
during
the
allotment
era
and
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference
to
them
and
it's
very
important
to
the
tribes
for
several
reasons,
not
only
for
economic
development
and
self
sufficiency,
but--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--they
were
removed
from
tribal
ownership,
i--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--suppose
that's
a
more
correct--
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
--or
by
act
of
congress.
but
the
last
point
that
i
was
going
to
make
is
that
it's
also
important
for
the
tribes
to
rebuild
these
land
bases
because
it
is
becoming
increasingly
apparent
that
much
of
the
jurisdiction
that
tribes
have
as
semisovereigns
is
being
related
to
the
land
ownership
that
they
have
within
their
reservations.
so
it
makes
a
great
deal
of
difference,
both
economically
and
in
terms
of
self
government
and
in
terms
of
the
sovereign
jurisdiction
that
they
can
exert,
that
lands
within
the
reservations
be
rebuilt
and
that
they
be
reacquired
by
the
tribes,
and
that's
actually
one
of
the
reasons
we're
here,
is
because
the
tribes
are
starting
to
do
that
and
the
counties
and
states
are
objecting
to
that.
mr.
james
m.
schoessler
your
honor,
i
would
simply
suggest
that
if
that
kind
of
thing
is
read
into
the
indian
nonintercourse
act,
one
could
just
as
easily
read
into
the
act
that
it
applies
only
to
indian
country
and
reservation
lands,
and
if
we're
reading
words
into
the
act
that
would
be
a
more
acceptable
way
of
doing
it.
