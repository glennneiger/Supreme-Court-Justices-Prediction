justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
there
was
at
the
time
of
the...
there
was
at
the
time
of
the
allotment
and
the
other
distributions,
but
the
question
is,
doesn't
the
term...
don't
the
terms
of
the
act
cover
it
now
that
it
is
back
in
indian
or
tribal
ownership?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
point
that
there
would
have
been
no
point
in
making
that,
the
taxability
a
consideration
when
it
went
into
trust
if...
unless
it
were
taxable
before
it
goes
into
trust.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
imply
that
alienability
simply
is
not
the
sole
criterion.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
ingenious.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that
leaves
open
the
question,
doesn't
it,
because
the
question
here
is
whether
this
particular
tax
exemption
in
fact
would...
is
of
the
traditional
variety,
or
whether,
because
of
the
history
traced
in
yakima,
it's
in
a
different
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
think
what
the
court
said
really
leaves
the
question
right
where
we
find
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
may
be.
i
think...
i
thought
the
point
was
simply
that
it
confirms
a
conclusion
that
we
might
reach
on
other
ground.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
mcdowell--
justice
david
h.
souter
--may
i
ask
you,
not
necessarily
now,
but
at
some
point
during
your
argument,
to
comment
on
the
argument
that
mr.
maus
made,
and
i
understood
it
to
go
basically
like
this.
he
accepts
the
unmistakability
doctrine.
he
then
says,
look
what
you've
done
so
far,
look
what
you've
held
so
far.
you've
held
that
allotment
lands
that
ultimately
are
reconveyed,
or
ultimately
end
up
at
the
present
time
in
the
hands
of
an
indian
or
of
a
tribe
are
taxable.
if
those
lands
are
taxable,
how
could
you
possibly
attribute
to
congress
an
intent
not
to
provide
the
like
treatment
to
lands
that
come
back...
that
come
to
the
tribe
or
the
indian
after
having
been
through
the
pinelands
conveyance
process,
or
the
process
in...
pursuant
to
the
homestead
act?
it's
an
a
fortiori
kind
of
argument,
and
at
some
point
will
you
comment
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
he...
but
i
think
we
accept,
and
i
mean
i
think
the
premise
of
his
argument
was,
the
statement
does
not
have
to
have
an
express
reference
to
the
particular
land
or
category
of
land.
it's
simply
got
to
be
unmistakably
clear.
and
if
it's
unmistakably
clear
for
allotment
lands,
it's
got
to
be...
you've
got
to
have
the
same
rule
for
nonallotment
lands
that
would
convey
out.
i
mean,
it
would
just
be
bizarre
otherwise,
and
that's
where
the
unmistakability
comes
from,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
didn't
we
say
that
in
yakima?
didn't
we
equate
land
in
the
hands
of
the
tribes
and
of
the
indians?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
did
expressly
refer...
it
expressly
referred
to
both,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
which
were
an
issue,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
if
you
take
that
as
your
starting
place,
that
allotment
lands
which
by
whatever
process
end
up
back
in
the
hands
of
the
tribe,
or
end
up
in
the
hands
of
the
tribe
are
going
to
be
taxable,
isn't
it
a
pretty
strong
argument
that
lands
that
went
out
by
way
of
the
pinelands
or
the
homestead
act
kind
of
conveyances
have
got
to
be
in
the
same
position,
or
you're
attributing
a
certain
sort
of
bizarreness
to
congress.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
we're
talking
about
land
that
was
sold
by
the
united
states.
that's
what
we've
got
here
and,
as
i
understand,
the
object
of
those
two
categories
of
conveyances
were
either
settlement
or
exploitation
of
natural
resources,
and
certainly
those
are
two
paradigm
examples
of
land
uses
that
congress
would
have
assumed
would
be
taxable
in
the
normal
course
and
that,
if
anything,
makes
the
a
fortiori
argument
all
the
stronger.
