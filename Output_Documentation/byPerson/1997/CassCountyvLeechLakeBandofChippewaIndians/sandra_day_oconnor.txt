are
these
parcels
within
the
boundaries
of
the
tribal
reservation
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--right.
they're
within
the
reservation
boundaries
and
held
in
trust
for
the
benefit
of
the
tribe,
by
virtue
of
the
reacquisition
by
the
tribe?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
they
had
never
been
sold
off
as
pinelands
and
homesteads,
you
concede
that
no
county
tax
would
have
been
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
were
additional
parcels
that
were
reacquired
pursuant
to
the
lands
covered
by
the
dawes
act
as
amended
by
the
burke
act,
but
they're
not
at
issue
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
to
those
parcels
the
tax
is
being
levied
and
the
burke
act
expressly
says
that
taxation
is
possible,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
leech
lake?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
indian
nonintercourse
act
in
effect,
or
its
predecessor,
at
the
time
of
goudy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
are
we
to
make
of
that
nonintercourse
act
as
part
and
parcel
of--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
not?
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
suggests
there's
any
distinction
between
reservation
or
nonreservation
lands.
