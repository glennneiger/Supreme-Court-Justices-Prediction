mr.
earl
edwin
maus
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
it's
cass
county's
position
in
this
case
that
the
alienable
land
patented
in
fee
by
the
federal
government
and
subsequently
reacquired
in
fee
by
the
indian
tribe
is
subject
to
state
and
local
taxation
absent
treaty
or
statutory
exceptions
to
the
contrary.
in
1889,
congress
passed
the
nelson
act,
which
provided
for
the
complete
cession
and
relinquishments
of
lands
to
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
in
turn,
pursuant
to
section
3
of
the
nelson
act
and
in
conformity
with
section
5
of
the
general
allotment
act,
issued
individual
allotments
to
indians
in
conformity
with
the
section
5.
pursuant
to
sections
4
and
5
of
the
nelson
act,
they
sold
pinelands,
which
were
basically
timberlands,
on
the
open
market
to
individuals.
pursuant
to
section
6,
they
issued
homestead
patents,
or
gave
patents
in
fee
under
the
homestead
act
to
various
individuals,
again
on
the
open
market.
in
1993,
cass
county
began
taxing
all
of
the
above
lands
and
that
was
following
the
1992
yakima
decision
which
was
set
forth
by
this
case...
1992,
yakima
county
v.
yakima
indian
nation.
at
that
time,
there
were
21
parcels,
13
of
those
parcels
involved
a
lot
of
land,
and
that
issue
has
already
been
resolved
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
it
was
a
petition
for
further
review
of
that,
and
that
was
denied
on
cross
petition
for
that.
so
at
issue
here
today
are
the
pinelands
parcels,
seven
of
those,
and
one
homestead
parcel.
these
various
parcels,
i'd
point
out
to
the
court,
are
now...
the
ones
that
are
left,
they're
all
in
trust
at
the
present
time,
have
been
placed
in
trust
and
i
believe
it's
a
matter
of
public
record
since
about
1995.
why
we're
here
today,
there's
still
the
issue
of
back
taxes
that
were
sued
for.
in
addition,
obviously,
both
sides
want
to
know
how
to
deal
with
lands--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--for
purposes
of
this
lawsuit
we
have
stipulated
that
the
lands
are
within
the
reservation
boundaries.
whether
or
not
they're
within
accepted
reservation
boundaries
based
on
some
of
the
court's
recent
cases
or
not--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--is
a
matter
for
another
day.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
that's
correct.
they've
subsequently
been
put
in
the
trust,
and
in...
obviously
the
period
that
we
were
taxing
them
was
while
they
were
being
held
in
fee,
up
and
until
they
were
put
in
the
trust,
and
once
they're
put
into
the
trust
there's
no
dispute
that
we
cannot
tax
them.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
that's
correct.
if
they
hadn't
been
placed
on
the
open
market,
and
it's
our
contention
that
the
nelson
act
did
that
and,
indeed,
they
have
been
taxed
since
their
inception
or
their
sale
on
the
open
market
back
in
the
early
1900's----
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--they're
no
longer
at
issue,
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
well,
the
burke
act
says
that
but
we
believe
that
the
court
went
a
step
farther
than
that
in
the
yakima
case
in
finding
that
the
burke
act
made
it
more
clear,
but
that
section
5
of
the
general
allotment
act
made
it
clear
and
made
those
lands
taxable
as
they
were
alienable
following
the
logic,
basically,
of
goudy
v.
meath,
which
was
decided
in
1906,
and
decided
also
by
this
court.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
yes,
they
are.
under
the
trust
process,
pursuant
to
the
reorganization
act,
which
was
passed
in
1934,
there's
a
trust
process
where
the
band
can
acquire
lands,
apply
to
put
them
into
trust,
and
the
department
of
interior
makes
a
decision
based
on
whether
or
not
they're
to
be
put
in
trust,
and
one
of
the
criteria
for
that
decision
is
basically
the
effect
on
local
units
of
government.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
you
know,
basically
that's...
the
difference
being
this,
is
that's
what
congress
decided
to
do,
and
they
did
a
balancing
test,
obviously,
when
they
did
the...
passed
the
indian
reorganization
act,
and
wanted
to
look
at
land
as--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--that's
correct,
and
there
is
specific
language
that
says,
once
it's
put
into
trust,
that
it's
not
taxable.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
that's
correct.
it
could
not
be
sold.
it
would
have
to
go
back
through...
the
department
of
interior
would
have
to
approve
any
sale.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
that's
correct.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
okay.
all
of
the
parcels
in
issue,
all
21
of
them,
have
been
purchased...
were
purchased
since
1980.
that
was
the
earliest
of
those.
14
out
of
those
original
21
had
been
purchased
in
1993.
we
began
taxing
them
in
1993.
i
guess
there
was
some
confusion
in
the...
within
the
state,
you
know,
can
this
land
be
taxed
or
not,
you
know,
prior
to
being
put
into
trust,
and
after
the
yakima
decision
came
out,
at
least
at
the
county
level
we
received
one
of
the
state
memos
basically
saying
that
it
appears
that
this
land
is
taxable
and
we
put
it
on
the
tax
roll.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
we're
talking
about...
well,
basically
if
we...
if
it
went
on
the
tax
rolls
in
1993
it
would
have
been
taxes
payable
in
1994,
and
the
lawsuit
was
commenced
in
'95,
and
towards
the
latter
part
of
'95
all
of
these
parcels,
or
at
least
the
remaining
parcels
were
put
into
trust,
so
we're
talking
about
a
year
and
a
half,
basically,
i
guess
of
actual,
payable
taxes
for
most
of
the
parcels,
maybe
more
or
less
for
some
of
them.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
yes.
section
465
specifically
says
that
once
lands
are
in
trust
they
are
not
taxable.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
that's
correct.
it's
our
belief
that
the
legislature
could
have,
had
they
wanted
to
with
the
indian
reorganization
act
clearly
made
all
lands
that
were
acquired
by
the
tribe
not
taxable,
or
reacquired,
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
stopped
short
of
that,
in
effect
set
forth
that
process
to
give
us
some
input.
now--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--that's
correct.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
and
i...
you
know,
i
point
out
to
the
court
that
i
know
that
the
tribe
in
this
particular
case
and
united
states
is
taking
an
opposite
position
saying,
well,
we
just
can't
sell
the
land,
and
i
would
submit
to
this
court
that
that...
i
don't
believe
that
that's
the
case,
and
that's
not
our
position.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
correct.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
it--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--but
it's
real
simple.
it...
one
of
the
parts
that
it
says
early
on...
you
know,
it's
passed
in
1834,
okay,
and--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--yes.
it
was
actually
before
then,
but
the
latest
version,
i
guess--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--that
congress
had
addressed
was
1834,
and
it
provided
that
lands
couldn't
be
sold
without
the
permission
of
congress.
in
other
words,
congress
was
to
sell
lands.
in
other
words,
states
couldn't
take
lands
and
start
ceding
them
to
individuals.
well,
the
simple
answer
to
that,
the
real
short
one
is,
along
comes
the
nelson
act.
there's
congress'
authority.
in
fact,
they
take
the
land,
they
cede
it
and
relinquish
any
title
of
it
and
give
it
to
the
federal
government,
who
then
puts
it
on
the
open
market,
so
is
there
authority
to
get
around
the
nonintercourse
act?
absolutely.
in
addition
to
that--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--two
basic
answers
to
that,
i
guess.
there's
one...
you
know,
if
you
look
at
the
logic
of
reacquired
lands,
if
you're
looking
at
that
pure
logic,
you
have
the
indian
reorganization
act,
which
deals
with
the
reacquisition
of
lands
and
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
they
should
be
taxable
or
not,
whether
or
not
they
should
be
put
into
trust
or
not,
and
second
of
all--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--correct.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
and
second
of
all,
with
respect
to
that,
you
know,
the
court
couldn't
have
decided
the
yakima
case
the
way
it
did
had
that
been
the
case,
because
in
yakima
i
believe
that
there
were
some
parcels
of
land
that
were
due
to
go
tax
forfeited
and
that
was
at
issue
also,
because
there
was
some
government
lands
and
some
individual.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
correct.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
we
believe
that
congress
clearly
said
that
the
land
was
taxable
first,
i
guess,
looking
at
the
nelson
act
itself.
i
mean,
it
gave
absolute
fee
title
to
everyone.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
okay.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
okay.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
mm
hmm.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
we
believe
that
congress
clearly
said
so
by
making
it
alienable,
and
again
i
don't
want
to
pound
on
the
nelson
act,
but
that's
what...
what
made
alienable,
and
then
looking
at
the
logic
of
goudy
v.
meath
and
the
yakima
case,
which
basically
are
allowing
for
the
taxability
of
the
land
because
it's
alienable,
the
tax
is
on
the
land
itself,
and
i
think
that
congress
has
specifically
acted
in
the
area
of
lands
and
addressed
that,
you
know,
both
in
the
nelson
act
and
then
later,
of
course,
in
the
indian
reorganization
act.
and
if
you
look
at
the
intent
of
congress...
and
clearly
we
have
to
put
up
unmistakably
clear
intent,
and
that's
a
burden
we
accept,
and
we
do
think
that's
the
correct
burden
of
proof
here.
we
think
that
is
all
met
when
you
add
up,
you
know,
the
way
it's
put
into
fee,
okay,
the
logic
of
the
alienability
of
the
yakima
and
goudy
decisions...
congress
clearly
made
it
taxable...
and
if
you
look
at,
you
know,
the
allotted
lands,
you
know,
they
made
them
taxable
after
25
years
as
opposed
to
immediately.
you
know,
that
was
part
of
the
general
allotment
act.
so
clearly,
you
know,
you
could
look
at
that
and
say,
well,
in
the
case
we
have
here,
would
it
make
sense
to
tax
people
that
reacquired
lands
that
were
originally
allotted
to
them
and
not
tax
lands
that
were
put
open
in
the
general
market?
i
mean,
that
kind
of
logic
doesn't
make
much
sense.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
that's
correct,
and
obviously
it...
well,
there's
been
a
history
of
abuse
of
getting
it
into
trust,
and
so
one
could
look
at
it
and
say,
well,
you
could
always
apply
for
trust.
well,
what
are
you
going
to
do
to
stop
that?
well,
we
don't
know
what
will
happen
in
the
future.
more
recently
the
department
of
interior
has
changed
some
rules
which
now
allow
for
30
days
after
they
decide
to
put
land
into
trust
for
counties
or
local
units
the
government
to
appeal
under
the
administrative
procedures
act
if
we
feel
that
the
decision
was
not
appropriate,
so
we
do
have
that
ability
now.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
okay.
sure.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
so
in
your
scenario
you'd
be
talking
about
land
that
was
acquired
for
the
first
time
outside
the
reservation?
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
okay.
i
think
the
reorganization
act
deals
with
land
acquisitions
by
the
tribe
in
general,
either
reacquired
or
acquired,
and
i
think
that
those
same
provisions
would
apply,
and
it
could
certainly
be
argued
that--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--the
trust
provisions
under
465.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
correct.
now--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--sure.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
sure.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
well,
i--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--well,
i
don't
know
about
that,
but
the
alienability
results
in
taxability
absent
treaty
or
statutory
exceptions.
now,
there
may
be
some
treaties
that
make
land
that
might
be
alienable.
maybe
you
can
sell
it,
but
it's
not
necessarily
taxable
because
it
specifically
says
it's
not
taxable.
and
also,
in
addition
to
that,
you
know,
the
tribe
also
has
the
ability
to
apply
for
state
exemptions
without
even
going
through
the
trust
process,
maybe
to
keep
their
land
alienable,
and
maybe
it's
exempt
for
some...
if
it's
for
some
governmental
type
purpose
that's
viewed
by
the
states
as
being
exempt.
for
example,
maybe
a
highway
maintenance
garage,
or
similar,
like,
you
know,
local
units
of
government
are
exempt
from
taxation,
just
like
cities
are
exempt
from
county
taxation
unless
they
have
investment
type
properties.
those
would
probably
be
found
taxable.
so
there
is
a
difference
there.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
deciding
this
decision
to
say
alienability
results
in
taxability
absent
treaty
or
statutory
exceptions
to
the
contrary
would
establish
a
bright
line
rule
that
could
be
applied.
it
doesn't
go
too
far,
in
that
if
there
are
individual
treaties
out
there,
or
individual
statutes
with
some
of
the
various
tribes
or
states
that
prohibit
this,
that
they
couldn't
be
taxed,
and
i
think
that
would
be
fair
for
all.
i
think
that
this
would
certainly
allow
the...
both
units
of
government
input
in
the
decision
making
process
which
it
appears
clear
that
congress
has
given
through
the
trust
process,
to
allow
the
local
units
of
government
at
least
to
have
their
say.
second,
you
know
that
as
a...
or
another
point,
as
i
also
indicated,
they
have
the
ability
to
apply
for
state
exemptions.
i
mean,
that's
part
of
the
overall
rule
too,
and
if
they're
appropriate
they
can
do
that.
an
adverse
ruling
in
this
case
to
the
county
and
other
local
units
of
government
could
have
an
adverse
ruling,
or
an
adverse
effect
on
local
units
of
government
in
particular
by
shrinking
what
has
been
heretofore
a
tax
base
that
encompassed
these
lands
by
taking,
you
know,
these
off
in
a
large
fashion
or
in
a
regular
fashion,
which--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--well,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
if
we're
looking
at
the
future,
you
know,
the
trust
process
has
changed,
and
will
the
tribes
be
able
to
get
land
into
trust
in
the
future
the
way
they
have
in
the
past?
basically,
throughout
the
history
of
the
county
we've
opposed
them
all
and
never
been
successful,
but
now
there's
a
new
appeal
process
and
we
haven't...
we
haven't
tried
that
yet,
and
that
may
result
in
the
slowing
down
of
lands
put
into
trust,
or
at
least
give
us
some
input,
or
more
input
into
that
process.
you
know,
is
it
going
to
hurt
the
tax
base,
for
example?
for
example,
putting...
one
of
these
parcels
involved
a
casino.
you
know,
is
taking
a
casino
and
putting
it
into
trust
going
to
hurt
the
county's
tax...
taxing
authority,
or
will
it
hurt
the
county?
because
you
know,
obviously
when
you
have
larger
parcels,
or
larger
investments,
you're
certainly
talking
about
more
government
services
that
are
needed
for
those
parcels.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
cass
county
is
about
200
miles
north.
it's
actually
in
the
north
central
part
of
the
state
of
minnesota.
it's
a
large
county,
as
counties
go.
it's
probably
close
to
the
size
of
rhode
island,
out
here,
and
the
portion
where
the
reservation
is
located
certainly
in
there
is
a
large
lake.
that's
probably
20
miles
by
20
miles,
with
a
lot
of
bays.
it's
kind
of
shaped
like
a
maple
leaf.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
yes,
and
then
there's
some
other
large
lakes
around
it,
and
the
economy
up
there,
just
so
you've
got
a
picture
of
that,
is
basically
one
of
tourism.
that's
the
number
1
business
up
there,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
parcels
of
land
up
there,
obviously,
that
are
owned
by
nonresidents
that
come
up
there
and
they
have
seasonal
cabins
up
there,
and
reside
there
for
the
summer,
and
so
the
increase
of
services
is
obviously,
i
suppose,
almost
three
or
fourfold
in
the
summer
than
it
is
during
the
regular
part
of
the
year.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
well,
we
certainly
raised
it
all
along,
and
i
would
say
in
the
eighth
circuit
court
that
the
decision
basically
gave
us
the...
you
know,
the
allotted
lands
similar
to
what
was
in
yakima...
didn't...
the
holding
was
there
basically
didn't
find
for
the
pinelands
and
the
homestead
lands,
saying
that
they
believed
that
this
court
relied
on
the
burke
act.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--to
find
that
language,
and
it's
our
position
that
court,
you
know,
looked
at
goudy
v.
meath
and
in
fact
didn't
find
the
burke
act
necessary
but
did
say
that
it
made
it
more
clear.
i
guess
if
something's
clear
they
make
it
more
clear,
so
it
had
to
have
been
clear
all
along,
so--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--yes.
thank
you.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
real
briefly,
your
honor.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
a
couple
of
things,
i
guess,
one
just
on
the
burke
act,
just
to
comment
on
that.
the
burke
act
needed
to
say
that
the
land
given
and
early
fee
patented
was
taxable,
because
if
it
hadn't
said
that,
i
submit
to
the
court,
there
was
still
that
provision
out
there
that
had
the
25-year
trust
period,
and
that
would
have
meant
that
the
land
would
have
become
alienable,
not
taxable
to
the...
at
the
end
of
that
25
years,
so
the
court
had
to...
i
mean,
the
proviso
needed
to
say
that
for
the
early
fee
patenting.
i
think
that
clears
that
one
up,
and...
hopefully.
also,
she...
you
know,
the
u.s.
referred
briefly
to
section
3
of
the
yakima
decision.
well,
that
dealt
with
the
excise
tax,
and
we're
not
here
about
that
today.
we're
here
on
land,
and
i
think
the
rest
of
the
court's
decision
dealt
solely
with
land,
and
those
taxes
are
certainly
distinguishable
from
this.
and
one
final
thing,
the
new
york
case
that
was
cited
several
times
here,
that
involved
the
nonintercourse
act,
but
in
that
new
york
case
there
was
never
any
act
of
congress
to
sell
those
lands.
those
lands
were
aboriginal
lands
that
were
just
merely
put
on
the
tax
roll,
and
so--
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
--that's
correct.
mr.
earl
edwin
maus
that's
correct,
and
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
nonintercourse
act
applies
to
lands
that
have
never
been
alienable.
in
other
words,
congress
has
never
made
them
alienable
and
they've
kept
them
just
as
they
were.
i
have
nothing
further,
unless
there's
further
questions.
