ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
we
would
initially
take
the
position
that
there's
been
no
statement
here
or
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent
to
tax--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we
do
not
believe
it's
unmistakably
clear
that
congress
intended
to
tax
even
the
allotment
lands
in
the
hands
of
the
tribe.
there's
only
a
reference
in
the
general
allotment
act
to
taxation
of
lands
in
the
hands
of
individual
indians.
we
would
submit,
given
the
governmental
status
of
a
tribe,
that
congress
would
have
needed
to
make
a
clearer
statement
of
an
intent
to--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--the
court
didn't
draw
the
distinction
in
yakima.
however,
the
distinction
is
not
based--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it
expressly
referred
to
the
fact
that
there
were
tribally
owned
lands
there,
as
well.
however,
neither--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
this
court's
rule
is
that
there
must
be
some
sort
of
unmistakably
clear
expression
of
what
congress
intended,
and
it's
impossible
to
tell
here
what
congress
would
have
intended
about
land
that
came
back
into
the
possession
of
the
tribe.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
congress
obviously
would
have
understood
at
the
time
that
there
were
many
different
tax
statuses
that
might
have
occurred
with
respect
to
the
homestead
lands
and
the
pinelands,
depending
on
whether
and
how
they
were
actually
acquired.
the
lands,
after
all,
were
ceded
by
the
tribe
to
the
united
states.
it
was
possible
that
the
lands
would
never
be
sold
by
the
united
states
and
thus
would
never
become
taxable
at
all.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
congress
doubtless
would
have
assumed
that
they
would
be
taxable
in
the
hands
of
an
ordinary
non
indian
individual
or
business
taxpayer,
but
we
cannot
conclude
what
congress
would
have
intended
had
the
lands
been
reacquired
by
a
tribe
within
the
boundaries
of
an
existing
reservation.
congress
was
legislating
in
189...
89
at
the
time
of
the
nelson
act
and
subsequently,
in
light
of
this
court's
decision,
for
example,
in
the
new
york
indians,
which
squarely
held
that
tribally
owned
fee
lands
were
not
taxable
to
the
tribe,
so
there
was
the
background
there
that
suggests
that
we
cannot
conclude
what
congress
would
have
intended
back
then
with
the--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--yes,
your
honor.
it
wasn't
raised
by
the
parties,
by
the
united
states,
or
focused
on
by
the
court.
there
are
a
couple
of
reasons
why
i
think
that
might
have
been
the
case.
one
is
that
there
was
a--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--oh,
that
was
certainly
part
of
the
factual
background
of
the
case,
your
honor.
then
you
would--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--the
distinction
was
not
drawn
perhaps
because
the
focus
of
the
tribe
was
on
the
parcels
that
was
owned
by
individuals.
those
were
the
only
parcels
on
which
the
county
had
been
attempting
to
foreclose
in
yakima.
also,
there
was
a
special
statute
in
yakima
that
applied
to
at
least
some
of
the
tribally
owned
lands
that
provided
that
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
any
special
tax
status
by
virtue
of
their
ownership
by
the
tribe
that
suggested
that
in
the
yakima
situation
the
only
protection
that
the
tribe
might
have
would
be
the
same
status,
same
protections
as
would
be
available
to
individual
indians.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
these
lands
are
not
alienable.
goudy
is--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--we
would
take
the
position
that
the
nonintercourse
act
was
intended
to
apply
only
within
indian
country.
downtown
minneapolis
is
not
indian
country.
this
is
consistent
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
1834
act.
the
question
arose
about
section
465
and
its
meaning.
it's
not
a
clear
statement,
obviously,
of
congressional
intent
with
respect
to
the
taxable
status
of
tribally
owned
reservation
lands.
it
should
be
emphasized
that
465
was
designed
to
allow
the
united
states
to
take
in
trust
both
lands
on
the
reservation
and
lands
off
the
reservation,
lands
that
clearly
would
have
been
taxable
prior
to
their
being
taken
into
trust.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct,
but
there
are
many
tribes
that
have
held
lands
for
over
a
century
now
that
have
not...
never
been
taken
into
trust
and
have
always
been
recognized
to
be
exempt
from
tax.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
traditionally
those
lands
have
been
understood
to
be
protected
by
the
fact
of
indian
tax
immunity,
the
absence
of
a
clear
statement,
and
the
fact
that
those
lands
were
within
an
existing
reservation,
the
new
york
indians
being
an
example
of
that
case.
certainly
it's
hard
to
attribute
to
congress
an
unexpressed
intent
to
overrule
the
new
york
indians
and
other
cases
of
that
kind
when
it
passed
section
465.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
my
understanding,
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
but
the
decision
then
goes
on
to
say
that
it
took
section
6
and
the
burke
act
proviso
to
make
that
implication
clear.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
section
3
of
the
court's
opinion
in
yakima,
where
the
court
actually
starts
applying
the
clear
statement
rule
to
the
actual
two
taxes
at
issue
in
that
case
and
there,
when
the
court
decides
that
the
ad
valorem
tax
in
yakima
is
permissible,
it
is
because
it
constitutes,
quote,
taxation
of
property
within
the
meaning
of
section
6
of
the
general
allotment
act
and
the
burke
act
proviso.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
may
i
answer,
your
honor?
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
court
looked
back
at
section
5
of
the
burke
act,
of
the
general
allotment
act,
rather,
to
determine
that
congress'
intent,
as
clearly
expressed
in
section
6,
also
referred
back
to
section
5.
thank
you.
