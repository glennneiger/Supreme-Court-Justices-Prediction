justice
ruth
bader

and
so--
--and
that's
the
second
465
procedure
that
you
said,
if
they
want
to
get
tax
exempt...
it
doesn't
happen
automatically.
i
think
when
justice
o'connor
asked
you
when
the
tribe
reacquires
it,
does
it
then
gain
exemption,
and
i
think
your
answer
is
no,
not
unit
there
is
this
465
procedure
to
put
it
back
in
trust,
at
which
point
it's
neither
alienable
nor
taxable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
how
many
years
are
we
talking
about
that
it
was
in
this
state
where
it
was
reacquired
by
the
tribe
but
not
yet
put
in
trust?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
we're
talking
about
2
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
told
us
that's
in
fact
what
happened.
it's
only
a
year
and
a
half
we're
talking
about
because
the
government
did
put
this
land
back
in
trust,
and...
which
made
it
exempt,
so
the
argument
that
the
counties
are
losing
all
this
revenue,
it
wouldn't
have
had
the
opportunity
to
get
any
if
the
government
had
moved
fast
enough
on
the
465,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.--
--why
wouldn't
that
act
apply
to
the
indian
allottees,
because
one
of
the
curiosities
about
the
eighth
circuit
decision
is
the
land
that
was
allotted
to
homesteads
then
reverts
to
the
tribe
and
becomes
nontaxable,
but
the
land
that
was
allotted
to
indians
doesn't
acquire
that
status
when
it
goes
back
to
the
tribe,
so
what
would
a
rational
legislature
be
thinking
about
saying
if
the
land
went
to
a
non
indian
then
it
immediately
reacquires
its
tax
exempt
status,
but
if
it
went
to
an
indian,
then
it
stays
subject
to
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
why
doesn't
that
cover
the...
why
wouldn't
that
take
care
of
the
whole
case,
not
just
the
parcels
that
went
to
homesteaders?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
once
the
court
has
determined
that
it
is
clear
with
respect
to
land
that
was
allotted
to
individual
indians,
once
the
court
has
made
that
determination
that
that
is
clear,
then
why
isn't
it,
as
justice
souter
says,
equally
clear
that
no
rational
congress
could
have
envisioned
a
different
treatment
for
the
land
that
went
out
not
under
allotments
to
individual
indians?
what
rational
congress
would
say,
yeah,
we
meant
that
if
it
was
allotted
to
indians,
it's
reacquired
by
the
tribe
tax
free,
but
if
it
went
out
under
the
homestead
act,
then
the
tribe
has
its
exemption?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
in
your
brief
that
yakima...
it's
evident
that
it
rested
primarily
on
section
6.
i
guess
justice
scalia
can...
is
best
equipped
to
respond
to
that,
but
i
read
his
decision
to
say
when
section
5
rendered
the
lands
alienable
it
also
rendered
them
assessable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
make
it
more
clear.
it
said,
reaffirmed,
made
it
more
clear,
reaffirmed,
but
reaffirmed
sounds
to
me
like
it
was
confirming
what
was
already--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
if
everything
rides
on
the
burke
act,
then
why
didn't
that
protect
only
the
parcels
where
there
was
premature
patenting?
