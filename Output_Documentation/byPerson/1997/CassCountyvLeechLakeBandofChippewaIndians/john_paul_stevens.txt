justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
be
sure
i
understood
something
you
said?
when
the
land
was
reacquired
by
the
tribe,
did
you
tell
me
that
you
seek
to
tax
it
while
it
was
owned
by
the
tribe,
but
you
say
you
cannot
tax
it
after
the
tribe
had
it
put
back
in
trust?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
who's
the
trustee?
is
the
united
states
the
trustee?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
quite
understand
why
it
should
make
a
difference
whether
the
land
is
owned
outright
by
the
tribe
or
held
for
the
tribe
in
trust
by
the
united
states.
i
don't
understand
why
that
should
make
a
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
in
other
words
is,
that's
required
by
the
1934
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
is
it
also
not
alienable
if
it's
in
trust?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
point
is
that
there's
a
distinction
because
if
it's
not
put
into
trust
the
tribe
can
sell
it
and
do
whatever
it
wants
to
with
it,
but
if
they
put
it
in
a
trust
they
have
to
get
the
consent
of
the
united
states
to
do
something
with
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you
if...
you've
called
our
attention
to
section
465,
about
the
land
going
into
trust.
did
the
courts
below
give
any
attention
to
that
section,
or
has
it
been
briefed
at
all?
or
did
it
just
come
out
of
the
blue
this
morning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
proviso--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
it
says,
the
negative...
it
does
expressly
say
that
if
the
secretary
does
acquire
the
land
in
trust
for
the
indians,
the
land
shall
therefore
be
tax
exempt,
which
one
assumes
that
before
it
was
acquired
it
was
not
tax
exempt.
that's
the
argument,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
know,
ironically,
if
you
read
it
literally
i
think
it
would
have
foreclosed
a
transfer
from
the
tribe
to
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
hadn't.
i
mean,
nothing
in
the
statute
authorized
that,
as
i
read
it.
maybe
i'm
missing
something.
nothing
in
the
nonintercourse
act
authorizes
conveyances
by
indian
tribes
to
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
part
of
your
submission
that
we
overlooked
the
significance
of
tribal
ownership
in
the
yakima
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
465
the
source
of
the
authority
exercised
in
this
case
to
acquire
the...
these
lands
in
trust
by
the
united
states
to
hold
in
trust
for
the
indians,
for
the
tribes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
weren't
those
lands
that
had
never
been
alienated
before?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they'd
been
indian
territory
from
the
beginning.
