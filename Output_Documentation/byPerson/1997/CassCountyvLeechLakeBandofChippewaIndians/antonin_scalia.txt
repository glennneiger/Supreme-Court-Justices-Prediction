justice

does
the
provision
of
the
law
which
enables
these
parcels
to
be
put
in
trust,
does
that
say
that
when
they
go
into
trust
they
are
no
longer
taxable?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
probably
wouldn't
be
necessary
if
they're
not
taxable
anyway
so
long
as
the
tribe
acquires
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
the
indian
nonintercourse
act--
justice
antonin
scalia
--argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
what
is
your
answer
to
the
indian
nonintercourse
act?
i
mean
if
you
read
it,
it
does
say
that,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
earlier
than
that.
is
that
when
it
started?
i
thought
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
maus...
i'm
not
sure
we
have
to
reach
it,
but
maybe
we
do.
i'm
really
troubled
by
the
indian
nonintercourse
act.
suppose
the
tribe...
suppose
this
is
land
that
was
never
tribal
land?
it
was
never
allotted.
it
was
never
opened
to
homesteading
or
anything.
it
was
just
never
indian
land.
and
the
tribe,
as
a
tribe,
buys
this
parcel
of
land
that
used
to
be
owned
by
the
duke
of
albemarle.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
never
tribal
land.
why
isn't
that
land
covered
by
the
indian
nonintercourse
act,
so
that
once
the
tribe
has
it,
the
tribe
cannot
again
resell
it
without
a
treaty
or
authority
from
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
provisions,
the
provisions
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
which
imply,
according
to
you,
that
if
they
are
not
put
into
trust
they
are
taxable,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
you
would
reason,
and
since
they
are
taxable,
you'd
sort
of
go
backwards
from
your
reasoning
for
the
purposes
of
this
case,
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
since
they're
taxable,
they
must
be
alienable,
just
as
for
this
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you'd
say
if
they're
alienable
they
must
be
taxable.
that's
how
you
get
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trouble
is
we
say
that
on
the
one
hand
and
we
also
have
language
very
similar
to
that.
that
is,
that
it's
almost
irrefutable
implication
that
where
there
is
alienability
there
is
taxability.
you've
also
said
something
along
those
lines,
and
these
two
absolutes
seem
to
be
clashing
head
on
in
the
present
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
rely
on
the
indian
nonintercourse
act?
i
mean,
the
argument...
i
thought
that
both
you
and
the
united
states
made
the
argument
that
that
in
fact
renders
everything
held
by
the
tribe
not
freely
alienable.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
broad
statement
you
just
made
that
if
we
adopted
that
rule
all
indian
land
would
be
taxable
except
trust
land
is
not
true
if
we
accept
your
ina
argument,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
don't
think
it's
a...
i
mean,
it's
a
sword
on
the
one
side
and
a
pen
knife
on
the
other.
i
think
it's
a
good
deal
for
the
tribes.
they
just
ought
to
buy
up
all
land
in
sight
and
they
have
a
great
economic
advantage
over
all
other
landholders.
maybe
they
don't
have
to
pay
taxes
and
what
they
ought
to
do
is
acquire
vast,
you
know,
acreage
and
then
lease
it
out
to
other
people,
which
can
be
done
very
profitably
because
the
scheme
just
exempts
the
real
estate
from
taxes.
it's
really
a
wonderful
opportunity
for
the
tribes.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
--a
couple
of
hundred
years?
i
mean,
it's
been
around
since
1790.
isn't
that
when
the
thing
first
came
up?
i
don't
know
why
they're
going
to
suddenly
pass
a
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
from
the
tribes
necessarily.
it
provided
that
the
united
states
could
acquire
land
in
trust
for
the
tribes,
but
they
could
acquire
it
from
private...
and
indeed,
i
think
that's
mainly
what
was
envisioned,
acquiring
it
from
private
sources
so
it
wouldn't
collide
with
the
nonintercourse
act
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
did
we
take
the
trouble
to
comment
that
there
were
both
tribal
and
nontribal
lands,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
but
if
it
was
an
irrelevant
portion,
we
shouldn't
have
mentioned
it.
i
mean,
we've
just
created
a
lot
of
difficulty
by
mentioning
that.
you
don't
have
to
mention
stuff
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
this
a
big
problem?
i
mean,
the
united
states,
who
argues
here
on
behalf
of
the
indians,
can
obviously
achieve
what
it
wants
to
achieve
simply
by
taking
these
lands
into
trust,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
taken
into
trust?
but
they're
protected
by...
those
lands
aren't...
they're
protected
by
the
rule,
aren't
they,
of
alienability
equals
taxability?
