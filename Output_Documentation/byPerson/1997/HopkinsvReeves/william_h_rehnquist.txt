chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
no.
96-1693,
frank
hopkins
v.
randolph
reeves.
general
stenberg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
counsel,
will
you
please
take
your
seats.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was...
was
there
any
request,
general
stenberg,
for
such
an...
for
such
an
instruction
on
second
degree
sexual...
sexual
offense,
sexual
assault?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
doesn't--
--will
you...
you
tell
us
again,
are
you...
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
there
are
two
offenses
in
nebraska
which
have
exactly
the
same
elements,
and
one
carries
a...
a
possible
death
penalty
and
the
other
carries
a
very
small
sentence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
you
would
say,
too,
that
the
prosecutor
could
have
charged
simple
assault,
because
that
element
was
there,
although
the
prosecutor
had
enough
evidence
to
charge
considerably
more
than
that?
well--
--he
can
also
suggest
that
the
jury
can
act
in
an
inconsistent
way.
and
there's
no
constitutional
objection
to
doing
that.
there's
nothing
that
would
have
prevented
the
jury
from
returning
not
guilty
on
one
and
guilty
on
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
stenberg,
in...
in
this
case,
i
guess
the
defendant
stabbed
the
woman
seven
times.
why
would
that
come
ahead
of
voluntary
manslaughter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it's
all
hypothetical
really,
whether
this
comes
under
the
head
of
voluntary
manslaughter,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
you
may,
general.
mr.
mcleese,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
mcleese,
you
say
that
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska
has
never
had
to
confront
the
question
raised
here.
one
would
have
thought
they
would
have
had
to
confront
it
in
the
direct
appeal
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
respondent
never
raised
this
issue
in
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
even
in
the
eighth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcleese.
ms.
hutchinson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
if
the
state
were
to
say
that
intentional
murder,
committed
by
way
of
poisoning
is
a
capital
offense,
and
do...
do
you
say
you
would...
and
they
would
have
to
give
some
lesser
included
offense
in...
in
connection
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
there
was
an
offense
called
adulterating
one's
drink,
and...
would
you
have
to
charge
that
if
the
evidence
showed
the
person
put
strychnine
in...
in
the
thing
and
the
person...
the
victim
took
it
and
was
dead?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
okay,
but
let's...
let's
talk
for
a
minute
about
what
sort
of
evidence
would
support
the
ev...
the
giving
of
something.
supposing
that
the
evidence
showed
that
the...
the
defendant,
in
my
case
put
poison
in
the...
in
the...
in
the
cup,
the
victim...
intended
the
victim
drink
the
cup,
the
victim
drank
it
and
died.
now,
would
you
say
that
a
lesser
included
offense
would...
would
be
given
then,
had
to
be
given?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
this--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in...
supposing
we
take
the
facts
of
this
case.
would...
would
the
state
have
been
required
to
charge
on
simple
assault,
since
they're
obviously
was
a
simple
assault,
even
though
the
evidence
showed
that
it
went
much
further?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
it
have
to
be
a
violent
offense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
do
you
think
beck
said
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--was
this
the
reasoning
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i...
i
had
thought
it
wasn't.
perhaps
you
could
explain.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
brief
the
same
thing
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
distinction
between
the
unlawful
act
and
the
intent
crimes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i...
i
wasn't
so
much
asking...
you
mean
addressed
in
the
briefs?
or
do
you
mean
addressed
by
the
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
ms.
hutchinson.
thank
you.
general
stenberg,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank...
thank
you,
general
stenberg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
