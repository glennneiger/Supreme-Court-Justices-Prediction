justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i...
can
i
you
one
question?
i...
i
don't
think
he's
finished
answering
my
question
yet.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
is
one
thing
i've
tried
to
look
up
that
i
have
not
been
able
to
find,
which
to
me
is
important
as
a
matter
of
nebraska
law.
it
says
in
a
case
called
state
v.
price
that
the
state
cannot
refuse
a
request
for
an
instruction
in
a
capital
felony
murder
case
where
the
defendant
wants
to
insist
that
there
be
a
showing
of
intent
or
reckless
indifference
to
the
value
of
human
life.
are
you
familiar
with
what
i'm
talking
about?
it's
on
page
11
of
the
nacdl
brief.
do
you
know
what
i'm
talking
about?
if
you
don't,
it's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yeah,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
i'm
trying
to
think
up,
in
a
capital
case,
a
capital
felony
murder
case,
because
of
this
court's
jurisprudence,
nebraska
has
said
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
there
has
to
be
some
showing
of
either
intent
or
reckless
indifference
to
human
life.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
not
something
that
goes
to
the
jury
in...
in
the
guilt
phase?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there's
nothing
in
the
record,
is
there,
that
suggests
the
lawyer
ever
said
to
the
judge,
"judge,
the
reason
i
want
a
manslaughter
instruction
is
because
first
degree
murder
makes
it
first
degree
if
it's
a
first
degree
sexual
offense.
"
"but
maybe
here
there
was
a
second
degree
sexual
offense.
"
"and
that's
why,
since
if
it's
only
in
the
second
degree,
it
doesn't
fall
within
the
first
degree
murder
statute.
"
"that's
why
i
want
the
lesser
included
instruction.
"
i
haven't
found
a
word
that
suggests
anything
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
he
was
making
a
different
argument.
i
thought
his
argument
was,
look
at
the
language
of
first
degree,
what
the
legislature
has
done
is
it
has
taken
six
crimes
and
say,
if
you
commit
any
of
those
six
crimes
and
somebody
dies,
that's
first
degree
murder.
now,
look
at
the
language
of
the
manslaughter
statute.
you
might
think
that
manslaughter
is
if
somebody
dies
in
any
other
crime...
any
other
than
the
six...
it's
manslaughter.
you
might
think
that's
the
law
in
nebraska.
but
the
language
of
manslaughter
covers
those
six
crimes,
too.
and
that's
why
i
want
the
offense.
i
mean,
i
do
not
know
any
other
argument
he
could
have
been
making.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
speaking
generally,
and
i'm
trying
to
understand
whether
there
is
anything
in
the
record
which
would
say
to
the
judge,
"judge,
i
want
a
manslaughter
instruction
because
the
evidence
suggests
that
my
client
didn't
commit
first
degree
sexual
assault.
"
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
what
is
in
beck
or
in
logic
or
anything
else
that
says
if
man...
if
nebraska
wants
to
say
this,
"people
of
nebraska,
if
you
commit
one
of
six
crimes
and
somebody
dies,
that's
first
degree
murder;
if
you
commit
any
other
crime
other
than
those
six
and
somebody
dies,
that's
manslaughter.
"
is
there
anything
in
the
constitution
that
would
stop
nebraska
from
saying
that?
i
think
the
answer
is
no.
and
then
my
question
is,
well,
how
is
this
any
different?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
the
question
was,
well,
what
is
a
lesser
included
offense?
a
lesser
included
offense
could
be
what
nebraska
says
it
is,
in
which
case
you
would
lose,
or
it
had
some
independent
definition.
if
it
has
an
independent
definition,
i
thought
it
was...
and
here
is
what
i'm
interested
in
your
view
on...
take
an
offense.
it
has,
let's
say,
four
elements,
a,
b,
c,
and
d.
that's
the
big
offense.
and
if
there
is
another
offense,
such
that
it
is
lesser
and
you
are
guilty
of
it,
with
not
four
but
three
of
those
four,
or
two
of
the
four,
or
one
of
the
four,
that's
a
lesser
included
offense.
now,
if
that's
what
it
is
in
principle,
i'm
not
sure
how
that
stacks
up
here.
because
what
we
have
here
are
two
elements,
a
and
b.
and
a
and
b
is
first
degree.
and
a
and
b
is
also,
under
the
language
of
the
manslaughter
statute,
manslaughter.
that's
a
very
unusual
situation.
that's
why
i'm
not
certain
what
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
there
are
two
elements.
the
two
elements
are
somebody
is
dead
and
there
was
a
first
degree
sexual
assault.
in
other
words,
one
of
the
six
big
crimes.
that's
the
definition
of
the
big
offense.
the
definition
of
the
little
offense
is
somebody
is
dead
and
there's
a
crime.
all
right?
the
same
two.
now,
that's
what's
causing
the
problem
in
my
mind.
and...
and
it's
not
what
i
think
of
as
the
normal
lesser
included
offense.
and...
and
that's...
i'm
not
saying
i
have
the
answer.
that's
why
i
put
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
there's
only
one,
which
is
it
sounds
as
if
there
is
a
situation,
where
if
you
looked
at
what
nebraska
says,
you
lose.
okay.
so
we're
not
doing
that,
hypothetically.
what
we
have
is
the
big
crime,
two
elements,
a
dead
person
and
one
of
six
big
crimes.
now
we
look
to
what
you
call
the
lesser
included
offense.
and,
once
again,
two
elements,
a
dead
person
and
sufficient
to
find
one
of
the
six
big
crimes...
and
a
bunch
of
others,
by
the
way.
i'm
saying
that's
what's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
the
others...
fine,
that
was
our
little
discussion
about
the
nonfirst
degree
sexual
assault.
i'm
prepared
to
say
at
the
moment...
i'll
look
it
up...
but
none
of
that
stuff
ever
got
into
this
case.
but
i'll
look
it
up.
but--
