mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
thank
you.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
the
question
of
whether
a
defendant
in
a
potential
capital
case
has
a
constitutional
right
to
effectively
charge
himself
with
crimes
not
charged
by
the
prosecution
and
which
are
not
lesser
included
offenses
of
the
crimes
that
were
charged
by
the
prosecution,
and
to
have
his
jury
instructed
on
those
offenses.
in
beck
v.
alabama,
this
court
had
said...
said
that
if
a
lesser
included
offense
exists
under
state
law
and
is
supported
by
the
evidence,
that
an
instruction
on
that
lesser
included
offense
must
be
given
at
the
request
of
the
defendant.
here,
respondent
reeves
was
charged
with
two
counts
of
felony
murder.
specifically,
he
was
charged
with
killing
two
women
in
the
perpetration
or
attempted
perpetration
of
a
first
degree
sexual
assault.
the
respondent
did
not
ask
to
have
his
jury
instructed
on
the
lesser
included
offense
of
first
degree
sexual
assault,
which
does
exist
as
a
lesser
included
offense
under
nebraska
law.
instead,
the
respondent
asked
to
have
his
jury
instructed
on
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter.
for
100
years,
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
clearly
and
consistently
held
that
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter
are
not
lesser
included
offenses
of
felony
murder
in
the
state
of
nebraska.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i
don't
recall,
your
honor,
if
the
requested
instruction
was...
was
specific
as
to
which
of
the
types
that
it
was.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
of
course,
for
100
years,
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
said
that
it's
not.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
the...
there's
two...
there's
really
two
answers.
one
is
the
more
general
answer
that
has
been
given
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
over
the
years,
which
is
simply
to
say
that...
that
there
are
two
different
intents
involved.
under
a
felony
murder,
the
intent
involved
looks
at
the
intent
to
commit
the
underlying
felony.
in
this
case,
the
first
degree
sexual
assault.
under
first
degree
premeditated
murder,
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter,
the
focus
is
on
the
intent
to
kill
or
the
intent
to
commit
the
murder.
in
answering
your
question,
your
honor,
we
have
to
ask
what
unlawful
act
are
we
referring
to.
if
we
are...
are
referring
to
the
unlawful
act
alleged
by
the
prosecutor,
namely,
first
degree
sexual
assault,
then
felony
murder
and
manslaughter
are
identical
offenses.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
case
of
second
degree
sexual
assault,
to
answer
your
question,
we
need
to
think
about
what
the
purpose
of
our
manslaughter
statute
is.
and
the
purpose
of
the
manslaughter
statute
in
the
commission...
killing
in
the
commission
of
an
unlawful
act
is
that
if
someone
is
committing
an
unlawful
act
and
someone
is
killed,
that...
that
makes
things
worse.
well,
manslaughter
is
a
class
iii
felony
under
nebraska
law.
second
degree
sexual
assault
is
also
a
class
iii
felony
under
nebraska
law.
so
there
would
be
no...
there
would
never
be
a
case
where
a
prosecutor
would...
would
need
to
charge
manslaughter
where
you
have
a
second
degree
sexual
assault
that
you've
already
proved.
the
killing...
proving
the
killing
adds
nothing.
and
so
i
think,
logically
then,
second
degree
sexual--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--we
certainly
could,
your
honor.
but
the...
but
the
concept
of
lesser--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
of
course,
the
prosecutor
could
have
charged
any
number
of
crimes.
that
doesn't
make
them
lesser
included
offenses
of
some
of
these
other
crimes.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
right.
well,
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
not
spoken
to
that
specifically.
but
my
answer--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--right,
exactly.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
as
an
analytical
matter,
i
just...
i
don't
think
it
fits
the
conceptual
framework.
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to...
to
have
the
prosecutor
have
to
prove
an
additional
element...
in
this
case,
a
killing...
in
order
to
get
the
same
punishment,
a
class
iii
felony.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
i
understood
beck,
your
honor,
to
rely
on
the
state's
own
definition
of
lesser
included
offenses.
i
did
not
understand
beck
to...
to
impose
a
federal
definition.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not.
and,
of
course,
first
of
all,
i
strongly
disagree
with
the
premise
that...
that...
that
the
definition
of
lesser
included
offenses,
under
state
law,
is
a
federal
matter.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
but
accepting
that--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
all...
i
guess
all
i
can
do
is
repeat...
try
and
repeat,
maybe
in...
in
slightly
different
words,
the
same...
the
same
point
that
i've
made--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
the...
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
never
analyzed
it
in
that
way.
they
have
clearly
spoken
to
it
many
times.
and
for
100
years,
it's
held.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i...
i
don't
believe
there's
a...
a
case
that
addresses
that.
i
would
add,
your
honor,
here...
and
i
think
it...
it's...
it's
relevant...
is
that...
that
even
if
it
were
a
lesser
included
offense,
that
under
the
facts
in
evidence
under
nebraska
law,
the
charge
would
not
have
been
given.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i
do
not
recall
that
they
ever,
at
the
time
of
the
trial,
identified
second
degree
sexual
assault.
if
they
had,
your
honor,
second
degree
sexual
assault
still
requires
an
intent
to
use
force
for
sexual
contact.
the...
the
only
defenses
in
this
case
were
insanity
and
diminished
capacity,
so
that
an
intent
could
not
be
formed.
so
that
if...
if
the
defendant
could
not
have
formed
an
intent
to
commit
first
degree
sexual
assault
and
therefore
a
felony
murder,
the
same
evidence
proved
that...
that
he
did
not
have...
would
not
have
had
the...
the
capability
to
form
the
intent
to
commit
a
sec...
second
degree
sexual
assault.
so
either
he
was
guilty
of
both
felony
murder
and
unlawful
event
manslaughter,
or
he
was...
he
was
innocent
of
both.
but
under
the
evidence
in
this
case,
he
could
not
have
been
acquitted
of
the
greater
and
convicted
of
the
lesser.
even
if
you
assume
that
second
degree
sexual
assault--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--your
honor,
there's...
the...
the
statute
has
two
different
ways
of
reaching
that.
one
is...
is
without
malice...
a
killing
without
malice,
upon
a
sudden
quarrel.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
a
killing
without
malice
upon
a
sudden
quarrel.
the...
the
other
type
of
manslaughter
defined
by
nebraska
law
is
a
killing
that
is
unintentional
during
the
commission
of
an
unlawful
act.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
yes,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--no,
your
honor.
what
you
just
described
would
be
identical
to...
to
the
felony
murder.
to...
to
convict
a
felony
murder,
you
need
a
first
degree
sexual
assault
and
a
killing
in
the
perpetration
of
that.
so
if...
if...
if
the
unlawful
act
we're
talking
about
is
first
degree
sexual
assault,
they're
identical
offenses.
so
you
either
have
to
convict
of
both
or
acquit
of
both.
and
of
course,
before
you
get
a...
a
lesser
included--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
your
honor,
that...
i
think...
i
think
that
probably
gets
to
part
of
the...
part
of
the
reason,
perhaps,
the
nebraska
supreme
court
does
not
regard
it
as
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
at
all,
your
honor.
because,
in
that
case,
the
jury
could
simply
pick
one
or
the
other,
with
no
standards
to
guide
its...
to
guide
its
decision.
it
would
not--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
but
if
they
have
the
same
identical
elements,
your
honor,
and
the
jury
follows
its
instructions,
it
could
not
logically
acquit
of
the
greater
and
convict
of
the
lesser.
and
before
an
instruction
would
be
given
in
nebraska,
or
in
most
courts,
the
possib...
one
of
the...
the
rationale
is
that
there
must
be
evidence
on
which
the
jury
could
acquit
of
the
greater
offense
and
still
convict
of
the
lesser.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
they
only
have
the
same
elements,
your
honor,
if
we
set
aside
the...
the
100
years
of
nebraska
jurisprudence
and...
and...
and
say
that...
try
and
say
that...
that
manslaughter
is
the
lesser
included
offense
of
felony
murder.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
exact...
well,
let's--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--on
an
elements...
not
in
the
view
of
the
nebraska
supreme
court.
based
on
an--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--elements...
on
an
elements
test,
if
the
underlying
felony
is
first
degree
sexual
assault,
then
yes,
manslaughter
and...
and
felony
murder
would
be
the
same
offense.
you
would
have
to
prove--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--oh,
sure.
the
prosecutor
could
have
charged--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
i
suppose
that's
always
true.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i
suppose
the
prosecutor
could
have
charged
on
trespassing
or...
or
indecent--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
i
think
that's
the
same
prosecute...
prosecutorial
discretion
that
exists
in
any...
in
any
criminal
case.
this
doesn't--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
because
the
jury
would
either
have
to
convict
of
both
of
acquit
of
both.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
it
seems
to
me,
your
honor,
that
this...
that
this
court's
jurisprudence
would...
would
prohibit
placing
before
the
jury
two
identical
offenses
with
the
same
elements
and
the
same--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
really,
your
honor,
the
furman
and
the
whole
line...
it
would
be
arbit...
it
would
allow
the
jury
to
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
choose
between
felony
murder
and
manslaughter,
with
no
standards
whatsoever
to
guide
its
judgment.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no,
your
honor,
i
didn't.
well,
potential...
potentially
there
would...
there
could
have
been
a
problem
if...
yes,
potentially
there
could
be
a
constitutional
problem
in
that
event,
yes,
sir.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
i...
i've
tried
to
answer
that
question
earlier,
your
honor,
by...
by
pointing
out
that
they're
both
class
iii
felonies,
and
it
would
make
no...
if
the
prosecutor
could
already
prove
second
degree
sexual
assault,
it
adds
nothing
to
prove--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
i
think
it's
a
matter
of
logic,
your
honor.
why
would
a
legislature
create
that
kind
of
system?
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
no,
i
disagree
that
they
have.
under
our
supreme
court
interpretations,
your
honor,
that...
that...
that
question
doesn't
arise.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
i
think
it...
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
from
the
evidence
that
it
was
not
an
unintentional--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--killing
here.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well,
it's
very
clear
that
it
was
not,
of
course,
an
unintentional
killing.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
well...
well,
i
think
it's...
i
think
it
is
hypothetical,
your
honor.
and
i
think
another
concept
of
lesser
included
is
that
the--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--that's
true.
that's
true.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
that's
exactly
my
point,
your
honor.
yes.
that's
exactly
it.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
that's
exactly
why
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter
are
not
lesser
included
offenses
of
felony
murder.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i...
i've
read
the...
could
you...
could
you
repeat
your
question?
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i've
read
the
case.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
could
you
repeat
your
question,
your
honor?
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
i
think,
your
honor,
that
may
refer
to
the...
to
the
eligibility
phase,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
but
i'd
have
to--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--that's
correct.
that's
my
understanding.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
you
do
at
the...
you
do
at
the
eligibility
phase,
not
at
the
guilt
phase.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
if
i
could
reserve--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--well,
there
was
really
no--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--no,
your
honor,
we
did
not.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
that
is
my
understanding
of
this
court's
jurisprudence.
and
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
have
a
couple
of
brief
points.
the
question
here
is
not
whether
the
nebraska
supreme
court
should
be
overruled
on
a
question
of
state
law.
the
question
is
where
there
are
no
lesser
included
homicide
offenses
under
state
law,
does
the
federal
constitution,
nevertheless,
require
that
the
jury
be
instructed
on
lesser
related
offenses?
i'd
like
to
clear
up,
very
briefly,
this
question
on
the
difference
between
first
and
second
degree
sexual
assault.
the
only
difference
is
what
the
person
is
intending
to
do.
in
the
case
of
first
degree
sexual
assault,
it's
an
intent
for
penetration.
in
the
second--
mr.
donald
b.
stenberg
--thank
you,
your
honor.
