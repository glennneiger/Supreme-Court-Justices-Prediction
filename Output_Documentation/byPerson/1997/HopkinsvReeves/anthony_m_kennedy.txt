justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
would
seem
to
be
almost
a
fortiori
under
beck
that
if
the
two
offenses
are
identical,
but
one
carries
a
lesser
penalty,
that
that
should
be
instructive.
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
even
easier
case
than
beck.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
knows
that
one
is
less
serious
than
the
other.
that's
the
whole
point
of
beck.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they
don't
have
to
be
identical.
couldn't
it
be--
--what...
what...
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so...
so
you
say
there's
a
con...
there
would
be
a
constitutional
violation
if
the
prosecution
in
this
case
indicted
for
both
offenses?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
the
intent
here
is...
is
a
little
difficult.
as
i
understand
it,
second
degree
murder
was
not
charged
because
there
was
no
intent.
and
yet
when
they
get
to
the
death
eligibility
phase,
they
have
to
say
there's
intent
to
comply
with
edmunds.
it
seems
to
me...
i
don't
understand
the
consistency
of
that
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
if
you're
the
actual
killer
under
edmund,
the
intent
to
kill
need
not
be
shown?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
still
seems
to
me,
then,
the
state
is
having
it
both
ways.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this...
no,
i
thought
you
were
done.
go
ahead.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask
you
a
different
kind
of,
sort
of,
rationality
question.
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument,
as...
as
some
of
our
questions
at
least
have
suggested,
that
involuntary
manslaughter,
where
the
underlying
act
is...
is
second
degree
sexual
assault,
would
be
a
lesser
included
offense
just
as
an
analytical
matter.
assume
that
to
be
the
case.
the
defense
that...
that
you've
raised,
as
i
understand
it,
is...
is
an
alternative
defense
of
diminished
capacity,
or
insanity,
either...
either
of
which,
as
i
understand
it,
would...
would
be
a
complete
defense
under
nebraska
law.
is
there
any
lesser
included
offense...
and
specifically,
is...
if
involuntary
manslaughter
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
could
a
jury
rationally,
on
your
theory
of
defense,
acquit
a
felony
murder
and
convict
of...
of
the
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
well,
strike
the
adjective,
then,
"involuntary".
i
take
it
there
is
a
nebraska
offense
of
unintended
killing
in
the
course
of
committing
an
unlawful
act,
and
that
an
unlawful
act
might
be
second
degree
sexual
assault;
is
that
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
well,
let's...
let's...
i'm
sorry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
going
back
to
my
question,
could
they...
on...
on
the
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
theory
of
defense
that
was
raised...
could
a
jury
rationally
have
acquitted
of
the
offense
charged
here
and...
and
then
convicted
of...
of
manslaughter
as
you
have
just
explained
it
to
us?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you're
saying
he
didn't
just
rest
on...
on
the
capacity/insanity
defense,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
now,
let
me
ask
you,
then,
a
different
question.
would
it
have
been
rational
for
a
jury
to
say
he
did
not...
we
find
that
he
did
not
commit
either
first
degree
sexual
assault
that
involves
penetration
or
attempted
first
degree
sexual
assault,
but
we
find
that
he
did
commit
second
degree
sexual
assault.
would
that
have
rationally
been
possible?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
guess
what
i'm
getting
at
is
the...
is
the...
is
the
possible
inconsistency
between
saying
there
was
no
intent
to
commit
the
assault
involving
penetration,
but
there
was
an
intent
to
commit
second
degree
assault.
can...
is...
is
second
degree
sexual
assault
capable
of
being
committed
not
only
without
penetration,
but
without
intent
to
commit
penetration?
that's
what
i'm
getting
at.
