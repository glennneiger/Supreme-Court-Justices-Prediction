ms.
paula
hutchinson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
one
undeniable
thing
about
this
case
is
that
the
enhanced
risk
of
an
unwarranted
conviction
was
created
when
the
prosecutor
elected
to
charge
in
the
information
felony
murder
only
and
nothing
else,
putting
the
jury
in
the
position
of
deciding
whether
to
convict
him,
of
its
only
choice,
or
to
set
him
free.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
no,
your
honor--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--we
would
submit
that's...
that's
exactly
the
case,
your
honor.
and
that's
what
beck,
together
with
hopper
and
spaziano,
seem
to
say.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
well,
only
if
the
facts
would
support
the
giving
of
some
lesser
that's
otherwise
allowed
under
the
law.
and--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--if
the
evidence
would
support
the
giving
of
something
less
than
a
capital
crime--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--if
all
those
elements
could
be
proven
from
the
facts
and
there
is
no
rational
theory
to
support
something
lesser,
then
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
to
give
a
lesser.
if
there
was
some
question
as
to
any
of
the
elements,
if
there
were
a
statute
that...
that...
that
would
have
supported
the
giving
of
lesser,
and
there
was
at
least
some
evidence,
then
beck
would
say
no,
you
may
not
charge
him
only
with
that.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
but
if
there's
no
evidence
to
support
that--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--the
state
would
not
have
been
required
to
charge
on
simple
assault,
your
honor.
i
think
schad
makes
clear
that
the
defendant
isn't
entitled
to
have
the
jury
select
from
a
menu
of...
of
lessers.
what
beck
teaches
is
that
if
the
evidence
is
clear
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
some
violent
offense
that
some
lesser
offense
that's
otherwise
allowable
under
state
law
be
given.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
because
beck
says
it's
so,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
because
if
it's
something
less
than
a
violent
offense,
then
that
wouldn't
address
the
issue
that's
at
the
heart
of
beck.
and
that's
whether
there's
a
distortion
in
the
factfinding
process
that...
that
causes
the
jury
to
say,
well,
he's...
he's
obviously
guilty
of
some
serious
crime,
some
serious
violent
crime;
we
can't
just
let
him
walk
out
of
the
courtroom
a
free
man.
which
is
what
the
jury
was
told
in
this
case.
and--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--oh,
no,
your
honor...
and
if...
if,
as
happened
in
the
state
of
nebraska,
the
state
erects
some
artificial
barrier
to
the
giving
of
a
lesser
offense
that
would
be
supported
by
the
facts,
then
beck
says
that
due
process
doesn't
allow
that.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
your
honor,
before
i
answer
that,
i
really
have
to
correct
a
few
of
the
misperceptions
created
by
the
united
states
about
nebraska
law.
and
one
of
them
is
that
there's
such
a
crime
as
involuntary
manslaughter
under
nebraska
law.
state
v.
jones,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief,
says
that
the
terms
"voluntary"
and
"involuntary
manslaughter"
have
not
been
a
part
of
nebraska
law
for
many,
many
years.
manslaughter
is
committed
without
regard
to
intent,
either
upon
a
sudden
quarrel
or
during
the
commission
of
an
unlawful
act.
there's
no
distinction
between
voluntary
and
involuntary
manslaughter.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
yes,
your
honor,
killing
without--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--killing
without
regard
to
intent
in
the
course
of
committing
an
unlawful
act,
which
nebraska
statutes
say
don't
need
to
be
specified...
second
degree
sexual
assault
would
be
one.
but--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--he
didn't
ask
for
an
instruction
on
sexual
assault
as
a
lesser
included
offense.
he
asked
for
an
instruction
on
manslaughter
under
either
theory
of
manslaughter.
and
the
unlawful
act
is
not
required
to
be
specified
under
nebraska
law.
the
information
can
charge
killing
and
slaying
in
the
course
of
an
unlawful
act.
and
the
information
does
not
need
to
specify
the
unlawful
act.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
they
most
certainly
could
have,
your
honor,
and
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
you
mentioned
the
affirmative
defenses
that
were
advanced
by
the
defendant.
well,
since
he
raised
the
defense
of
insanity
at
the
time
the
state
was
required
to
prove
him
sane
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt...
but,
more
importantly,
he
argued
to
the
jury...
and
you
find
this
in
counsel's
closing
argument...
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
to
find
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
a
first
degree
sexual
assault
or
an
attempt
of
that
was
committed.
and--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
it
most
certainly
would
have,
your
honor.
in
fact,
that's
an
entirely
plausible--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--certainly
it
can,
your
honor.
and...
and--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--first
degree
sexual
assault
and
second
degree
sexual
assault...
and
second
degree
murder,
for
that
matter...
all
are
general
intent
crimes.
and
it's
entirely
consistent
with
his
defense
and
with
the
evidence
in
this
case
that,
number
one,
there
was
scant
physical
evidence,
if
any...
there
was
only
some
circumstantial
evidence...
that
an
actual
first
degree
sexual
assault
occurred.
that
leaves
you
with
attempted
first
degree
sexual
assault,
which
is
a
specific
intent
crime.
and
the
jury
would
have
been
required
to
find
that
he
formed
the
intent
to
engage
in
behavior,
which,
under
the
circumstances
he
believed
them
to
be,
constituted
a
substantial
step
toward
the
committing
of
first
degree
sexual
assault.
which
is
certainly
a
great
deal
more
sophisticated
level
of
intent
than
that
required
by
a
general
intent
crime.
so
under
the
evidence
and
under
his
defense,
he
could
have
been
found
guilty
of...
of
manslaughter
unlawful
act,
with
a
second
degree
sexual
assault,
and
the
jury
could
have
found
that
while
he
didn't
have
the
sophisticated
level
of
intent,
based
on
his
gross
intoxication,
to
form
the
intent
required
to
attempt,
and
because
there
was
such
little
evidence
of
an
actual
first
degree
sexual
assault,
that
it
certainly
would
have
been
rational
for
the
jury
to
have
found
him
guilty
of
unlawful
act
manslaughter,
with
the
unlawful
act
being
second
degree
sexual
assault.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
your
honor,
the...
yes,
the
eighth
circuit--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--it's
on
page
60
of
the
ja.
the
eighth
circuit,
contrary
to
what
the
united
states
argued
on
brief,
said
the
facts
would
have
supported
conviction
either
on
second
degree
murder
or
on
manslaughter.
that's--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--no,
they
didn't
discuss
the
specifics.
what
they
made
was
a
blanket
statement,
saying
the
facts
would
have
supported
conviction
on
either
second
degree
murder
or
manslaughter.
and
it's
true,
as
you
said,
justice
ginsburg,
that...
that
the
eighth
circuit
said
that...
that
if
the
facts
would
have
warranted,
then
he
should
have
been
instructed
on
lessers.
and
that's
certainly
true
under
nebraska
law.
nebraska
has
erected
this
artificial
barrier
to
the
giving
of
lesser
offenses
that's
found
nowhere
else
in...
in
homicide
law
in
nebraska.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
your
honor,
i
briefed
to
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals
a
scenario
whereby,
under
the...
the
cognate
evidence
test,
which
was
in
effect
at
the
time
mr.
reeves
was
tried,
or
under
the
statutory
elements
test
that...
that
mr.
reeves
could
have
been
convicted
of
the
very
least,
under
the
statutory
elements
test,
of
manslaughter,
unlawful
act,
with
the
unlawful
act
being
a
sexual
assault.
and
those
briefs,
i
assume,
are
part
of
the
record.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
that
was
briefed
to
the
supreme
court
of
nebraska,
yes.
it
was...
the--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--i
don't
recall,
frankly,
mr.
chief
justice,
whether
the
specifics
of
the...
the...
the
manslaughter,
unlawful
act
were
addressed.
what--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--no,
addressed
in
the
briefs.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
i
don't
recall
whether
they
were
specifically
addressed
in
the
briefs.
but
one
thing
i
do
know
for
certain...
that
every
stage
of
this
case,
from
pretrial
onward,
the
court
was
pressed
that
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed,
under
nebraska
law
and
under
beck
v.
alabama,
on
the
lesser
included
offenses,
the
second
degree
murder
and
either
theory
of
manslaughter.
the
term
"lesser
included
offense",
beck
doesn't
seem
to
turn
on
the...
the
semantics
of...
of
what
constitutes
a
lesser
included
offense.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
we
could
have,
but
it
wasn't
necessary.
when...
when
defense
counsel
asked
for
an
instruction
on
manslaughter,
again,
statute
says...
it's
29-1512,
under
nebraska
law...
that
the
unlawful
act
not
be
specified
in
the
information.
and
so
it
was
sufficient
to
argue
that...
to
request
that
a
manslaughter
instruction
be
given
on
either
theory.
and
the
state--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--well,
justice
souter,
the
state
has
never
suggested
that
there's
an
inadequate
basis,
based
on
the
requests
that
were
made
by
counsel,
in
order
to
have
been
given
an
instruction
like
that.
i
think
the
court
pressed
with...
with...
with
all
deliberate
zeal
to
get
instructions
on
lesser
offenses
as
were
allowed
under
state
law.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
defense
counsel
argued--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--justice
breyer,
the
argument
that
he
was
making
is
that,
under
nebraska
law
since
statehood,
the
rule
has
been
homicide
is
but
one
offense,
the
degree
necessarily
being
for
the
jury.
and
when
there's
at
least
some
evidence
to
warrant
the
giving
of
lesser
offenses
to
first
degree
murder,
that
they
shall
be
so
instructed
and
that
it's
for
the
jury
to
determine
which
degree
of
homicide.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
there's...
there's
nothing
specific
that
i'm
aware
of.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
what's
in
the
record,
justice
breyer,
is,
"i
want
a
manslaughter
instruction
because
he
certainly
could
have
been
guilty
of....
"
ms.
paula
hutchinson
because
the
facts
would
have
supported
the
giving
of
lessers.
and
it's
clear
from
the
evidence...
defense
counsel
argued
to
the
jury
that
a
penetration
didn't
occur
and
that
it
was
because
of
his
intoxication
it
was
impossible
to
find
that
there
was
an
attempt
involved.
but
given
the
fact
that
the
jury
had
sat
through
a
6-week
trial,
hearing
the
grizzly
details
of
the
crimes,
after
the
defendant
had
stipulated
to
the
fact
that
he
caused
these
two
homicides,
it's...
it's
certainly
plausible
that
the
jury
was
going
to
focus
on
anything
but,
do
we
set
him
free
or
do
we
examine
the
forensic
evidence
and
say,
well,
the
acid
phosphatase
level
in
the
victim's
genitalia
might
or
might
not
have
been
consistent
with
intercourse,
and
there's
nothing...
nothing
to
have
said
that
a...
a
penetration
was
effected
as
far
as
physical
evidence.
of
course,
they
weren't
talking
like
that.
they
were
saying,
we
can't...
we
can't
let
this
man
walk
out
of
here.
the
jury
was
instructed
prior
to
argument,
among
the
last
words
the
jury
heard
before
it
retired
to
deliberate
was
the
prosecutor
telling
the
jury,
"if
the
state
doesn't
prove
its
case
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
state
doesn't
win
and
he
walks
out
of
this
courtroom
a
free
man.
"
that's
beck,
plain
and
simple.
that's
what
beck
says
you
can't
do
when
there
was
evidence
to
support
the
giving
of
lessers.
he
could
have
been
convicted
of
second
degree
murder,
as
general
stenberg
conceded.
the
evidence
certainly
could
have
suggested
that
he
effected
an
intentional
killing.
there
was
scant
evidence
of...
of
first
degree
sexual
assault.
but
the
jury--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--no.
and,
justice
ginsburg,
beck
makes
clear...
and
schad
certainly
makes
even
more
clear...
that
that's
not
required,
that
we
don't
throw
at
the
jury--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--well,
under
nebraska
law,
the...
the
common
law
at
the
time
that
was
in
effect
was
the
evidence
rule.
if
the
evidence
would
have
supported
the
giving
of
lessers,
the...
the
state
has...
as
the
state
put
it,
experimented,
and
it
takes
us,
i
believe,
a
couple
of
pages
on
brief,
i
think
on
pages
31
and
32,
to
recount
the
experiment
with
which
lesser
included
offense
test
it's
going
to
adopt.
but
for
homicide,
the
rule
in
nebraska
always
has
been
that
we're
not
constrained
by
the
semantics
of
lesser
included
offense
doctrine.
homicide
is
one
offense.
and
that
has
been
the
rule
in
nebraska...
it
was...
sense...
prior
to
statehood.
in
fact,
it
dates
back
to
the
1794
statute
that--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--again,
your
honor,
it...
second
degree
sexual
assault
may
not
have
been
specifically
requested.
but
the
law
in
nebraska
that...
is
that
the
unlawful
act
not
be
specified.
the--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--yes.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
first--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--yes.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
yes.
first
degree
sexual
assault
would
have
been
a
lesser
included
offense
of
felony
murder.
and
it's
true
that
defense
did
not
request
that.
the
reason
they
didn't
request
that
was
because
it
would
have
been
inconsistent
with
their
defense
that
a
first
degree
sexual
assault
never
occurred.
if
the
trial
court
felt
strongly
that
this
was
one
crime,
uno
actu,
and
that
it
was
a
felony
murder,
the
killing
being
a
first
degree
sexual
assault,
the
rule
in
nebraska
is
it's
the
judge's
duty
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
law,
whether
requested
to
do
so
or
not.
and
the
nebraska
supreme
court
routinely
takes
up
on...
under
the
plain
error
doctrine,
cases
where
the
trial...
where
the
trial
court
did
not
properly
instruct
the
jury
as
to
the
law
of
the
case.
and--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--absolutely.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
absolutely,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
is
a
case
that
we
cite,
state
v.
archibald,
where
precisely
that
happened.
the
defendant
did
not
want
a
manslaughter
instruction
in
her
affirmative
defense
of
selfdefense.
the
trial
court
felt
that
her
own
testimony
adduced
sufficient
evidence
to
charge
the
jury
with
manslaughter.
she
objected.
the
prosecution
didn't
request
it.
the
court
instructed
the
jury
anyway
because...
because
the
law
of
nebraska
is
that
the
jury
shall
get
any
el...
or
any
degree
of
homicide
upon
which
there's
at
least
some
evidence.
and
it's
the
trial
court's
duty
to
instruct
the
jury
on
the
law
of
the
case.
that
was
upheld
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court
on
appeal.
so,
again,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
yes.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
well,
i
think
i
heard
about
three
questions
in
there,
your
honor.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
i
think
i
may
have
heard
about
three
questions
in
there,
justice
breyer.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
and
it's
the
"and
a
bunch
of
others"--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--well,
and
again,
it
was
sufficient
under
state
law
for
the
defense
simply
to
request
a
manslaughter
instruction.
under
either
theory,
the
evidence
would
have
supported
the
giving
of
a
manslaughter
instruction.
but,
justice
breyer,
you
began
your
question
with
the
premise
that
if...
if
a
lesser
included
offense
is
only
what
the
state
says
it
is,
we
lose.
if
that
were
true,
well,
then
as
the
eighth
circuit
panel
said,
beck
would
have
been
decided
differently.
if
state
law
is
what
it
is,
you
lose.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
so
the
question
is,
once
a
state
has
erected
this
artificial
barrier
by
saying
there's
no
lesser
included
offense,
when
our
common
sense
tells
us
we
can
analyze
the
evidence
or
the
elements,
whichever...
whichever
we
choose
to
do...
and
find
that
in
fact
there
are,
then
we
examine
the
universe
of
state
law.
and--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--that's
what
beck
said.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
but
there's
certainly
no
meaningful
distinction
between--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--well,
if
the
state
says
there
is
none,
when
it's
quite
obvious
there
is
one,
and
other
areas
of
nebraska
law
require
the
giving
of
lessers
without
reliance
upon
lesser
included
offense
analysis,
there's
no
meaningful
distinction.
it's
an
artifice.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
normally
it
is.
but
in
nebraska
we
have
the
additional
issue
of
this
statute
that
says
homicide
is
but
one
offense.
and
in
one
case,
state
v.
vosler,
they
say
we're
not
constrained
by
the
traditional
lesser
included
offense
analysis
when
it
comes
to
homicide
because
of
29-2027.
ms.
paula
hutchinson
well,
the...
the
question
in
beck,
really,
is
the
state
allowed
to
erect
some
artificial
barrier
to
the
giving
of
lesser
offenses
when
they
otherwise
would
be
allowable
to
state
law?
there's
a
subset
of
homicide
that's
capital
murder
and
a
subset
of
that
that's
felony
murder.
and...
and
here
we
don't
give
lessers,
but
everywhere
else
we
do.
manslaughter,
under
the
traditional
statutory
elements
test,
can
be
considered
a...
a
lesser
included
offense
of
second
degree
murder,
but
it's
routinely
given
in
homicide
cases.
the
reason
for
that
is
2027.
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
never
explained
why
2027
doesn't
apply
in
felony
murder
cases.
and
the
statutory
rules
of
construction
are
the
same
in
nebraska
as
elsewhere.
statutes
are
to
be
read
in
pari
materia,
and
one
not
read
so
as
to
abrogate
the
other.
and
in
fact
the...
2027
has
been
abrogated
by
this
little
wildcard
in
nebraska
law
that
says
we
don't
instruct
on
lesser
degrees
of
homicide
when
the
offense
charged
is
felony
murder.
it's...
it's...
it's
artificial
and
it's
arbitrary.
and
it
creates
the--
ms.
paula
hutchinson
--there's
no
reason,
your
honor.
but
there's
no
reason
not
to
use
the
state
certification
procedure.
the
answer
to
that
has
to
be--
