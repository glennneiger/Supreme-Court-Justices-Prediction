justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
stenberg,
is
one
reason
you're
having
difficulty
on
this
point
is
that
the
nebraska
supreme
court
has
never
spoken
to
it?
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
talked...
the
"it"
was
felony
murder.
and
they
said
there
is
no
lesser
included
offense.
but
did
they
ever
confront
this
statute
that
says
manslaughter,
unintentionally...
unintentionally
killing
while
in
the
commission
of
an
unlawful
act,
they...
did
they
ever
say
yes,
we
looked
at
that,
those
words
on
their
face,
and
that's
not
a
lesser
included
offense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
except
that
the
charge
was
felony
murder.
the
charge
was
not
in...
intentional
killing,
isn't
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
felony
murder,
intent
is...
to
kill...
is
irrelevant,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
was
there
any
homing
in
on
this
unlawful
act
manslaughter?
see,
when
i
read
the
eighth
circuit's
decision,
i
thought
that
they
were
speaking
of
two
intent
crimes,
like
the
sudden
quarrel,
and
the
second
degree
murder,
both.
and
i
thought
that
that...
that
they
were
saying
if
there
is
anything
that
you
can
charge
other
than
the
capital,
then
you
must.
but
i
didn't
see
them
homing
in
at
all
on
the
unlawful
act
manslaughter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my...
my
question
still
is
i
didn't
see
it
in
the
eighth
circuit
opinion.
and
i
think
mr.
mcleese
told
us
it
was
never
presented
squarely
to
the
nebraska
courts.
this...
the
difference
between
an
intent
to
kill,
which
second
degree
murder
would
involve,
and
a
crime,
manslaughter,
unintentional
manslaughter,
that
doesn't
involve
any
intent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
conceded
that
you
could
have
asked
for
sexual
assault
as
a
lesser
included
offense,
but
you
didn't
ask
for
that
one?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
do
you
define...
how
do
you
define,
and
under
what
body
of
law,
lesser
included
offense?
i
mean,
we've
heard
an
argument
from
the
united
states
that
it
can't
mean
anything
the
prosecutor
might
have
charged.
do
you
agree
with
that,
as
far
as
that
much?
that
it's...
it's
not
anything,
given
this
episode
that
the
prosecutor
might
have
charged?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
is...
what
is
a
lesser
included
offense?
it's
not
anything
the
prosecutor
could
have
charged.
so
it's
something
less
than
that
universe.
so
what
is
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
had
a
concession...
we
had
a
concession
from
general
stenberg
that
sexual
assault
in
this
very
case
would
have
been
a
lesser
included
offense,
but
you
didn't
ask
for
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
talking
about
unlawful
act
manslaughter.
i'm
talking
about
sexual
assault
pure
and
simple.
the...
we
have
just
been
told
that
under
nebraska
law,
sexual
assault...
not
unintentional
killing
in
the
course
of,
but
just
sexual
assault--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--would
have
been
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
that
suggests
that
there
are
lesser
included
offenses--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--when
the
charge
is
felony
murder.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
mean
that
a
defendant,
even
who
doesn't
want
a
lesser
included
offense,
has
to
get
that
charge,
even--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--even
if
he
doesn't
want
it
and
the
prosecutor
doesn't
want
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
we've
already
gotten
over
that,
because
the...
because
the...
general
stenberg
said
sexual
assault
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
so
it's
not
a
situation,
as
in
beck,
where
you
could
not
charge
any
lesser
included
offense.
the
state
there
said,
yes,
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
but
we
have
a
statute
that
says,
in
murder
cases,
you
don't...
the
concept
is
off
the
books
in
murder
cases.
so
there
wasn't
any
quarrel
about
whether
it
was
a
lesser
included
offense.
here
that
seems
to
be
what
this
is
all
about,
whether
it
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
because
we
know...
we
know
that
the
precise
question
before
us
has
not
been
answered
by
the
nebraska
supreme
court,
would
it
be
appropriate
to...
to
use
their
certification
procedure
to
say
this
category,
unintentional
manslaughter,
did
you
mean
that
you
couldn't
charge
that,
together
with
a
felony,
as
a
lesser
included
offense?
why
shouldn't
the
nebraska
supreme
court
be
the
first
one
to
answer
that
precise
question?
