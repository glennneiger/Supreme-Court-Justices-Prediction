justice
john
paul
stevens
may...
may
i
ask...
and
maybe
it's
the
same
question
again...
but
what
are
the
elements
under
nebraska
law
of
involuntary
manslaughter?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
must
be
a
killing.
and
what
is
the
second
element
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
now,
is
it...
is
it
not
possible
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
they
could
have
found
that
there
was
a
killing
that
was
unintentional
in
the
course
of
a
sexual
assault?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and...
and
is
it
not
also
true
that
in
order
to
find
him
guilty...
what
they
did
find
him
guilty
of,
they
had
to
find
some
additional
elements?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
the
two
offenses
are
identical;
one
carries
the
death
penalty
and
the
other
carries
a
very
minor
penalty.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
i
interrupt
with
just
onequestion.
supposing
you
have
two
offenses
that...
one
of
which
has
three
elements
and
the
other
has
two
of
those
three,
and
that's
all
you
know
about.
and
nebraska,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
says,
well,
we're
not
going
to
call
that
a
lesser
included
offense.
would
beck
apply
in
that
kind
of
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
question
is,
in
your
view,
could
the
state
court
say,
well,
we
agree
that...
that
the
capital
offense
has
three
elements
in
it
and
we
also
agree
that
the...
some
other
offense
has
only
two
of
those
elements
in
it,
and
otherwise
they're
exactly
the
same.
but
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
we
will
not
treat
that
as
a
lesser
included
offense.
could
they
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
still
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is
what
is
your
view
as
to
whether
the
state
could
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you'd
rather
not
answer
the
question
is
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
different
from
beck,
i
agree.
it's
different
from
beck,
clearly.
but
i'm
just
asking
you
whether
the
rationale
of
beck
would
apply
squarely
to
that
situation
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question
for
just
a
moment.
isn't
it
correct
that
the
100
years
of
jurisprudence
in
nebraska
about
felony
murder
not
having
any
lesser
included
offenses
all
turns
on
the
fact
that
there's
no
intent
element
even
as
comparable
to
that
in
tyson
and
enmund?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
the
missing
element
of
all
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
constitutionally
there
must
be
such...
some
sort
of
intent
in
order
to
justify
the
death
penalty,
why
is
it
such
a
stretch
to
say
that
we'll
treat
it
as
a
lesser
included
offense
in
regard
to
what
the
total
proof
that
the
state
must
offer
is?
