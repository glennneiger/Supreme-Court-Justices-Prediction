mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
ruling
of
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
reflects
two
critical
errors
of
law.
first,
that
a
state
can
never
rely
on
its
own
law
as
a
basis
for
denying
a
lesser
offense
instruction
in
a
capital
case,
and,
second,
that
this
court's
decisions
in
tyson
and
enmund
are
relevant
to
the
question
of
whether
such
instructions
are
constitutionally
required
under
beck.
as
to
the
first
error,
this
court's
decisions
in
hopper
and
spaziano
made
clear
that
a
state
may
decline
to
give
lesser
offense
instructions
in
a
capital
case
based
on
the
application
of
state
law
principles,
such
as
the
requirement
that
there
be
evidence
to
support
the
giving
of
those
lesser
offense
instructions
or
that
the
lesser
offenses
be...
be
available
as
a
matter
of
state
statute
of
limitations
law.
and
it
is
surely
reasonable
for
state
courts
to
decline
to
give
lesser
offense
instructions
on
offenses
that
are
not
necessarily
included
in
the
charged
offenses...
what
might
be
called
lesser
unincluded
offenses.
a
requirement...
a
constitutional
requirement
that
state
courts
instruct
on
such
offenses
would
be
utterly
unworkable.
as
this
court's
decisions
in
dixon
and
schmuck
have
made
clear,
there
is
no
logical
limiting
principal
upon
the
idea
of
instructing
juries
on
lesser
unincluded
offenses.
there
is
no
limiting
principle,
once
you
get
into
that
form
of
analysis.
moreover,
given
criminal
defendants
the
right
to
inject
into
criminal
trials
new
offenses--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--i
mean,
for
example,
to
take
the
clearer
of
the
two,
second
degree
murder
under
nebraska
law.
second
degree
murder
under
nebraska
law
requires
proof
of
intent
to
kill.
felony
murder
does
not,
under
the
elements
tests,
as...
as
the
federal
courts
would
apply
it
or
as
the
nebraska
courts
have
applied
it.
it
is
quite
clear
that
that
is
a
lesser
unincluded
offense.
it's
lesser,
but
it
has
elements
which
are
different
from--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--involuntary
manslaughter,
under
nebraska
law...
the
nebraska
courts
have
said
for
100
years
that
it...
it
and
manslaughter
generally
are
not
lesser
included
offenses.
they
have
never,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
been
confronted
with
a
specific
claim,
focusing
on
unlawful
act
manslaughter.
so
they've
never
addressed
that
question.
and
i
think
that
raises
real
issues
of--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--i...
i
think
that
that
poses
the
question
of
whether
beck
brings
with
it
the
federally
constitutionally
required
imposition
of
an
elements
test
as
the
federal
courts
apply
it.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
i
think
it
would
be
an
extension
of
beck
and,
therefore,
a
new
rule
for
this
court
to
constitutionalize
the
elements
test.
and,
therefore,
i
think
beck
itself
does
not
establish
the
proposition
that
a
state
would
be
obliged
to
submit
el...
a
lesser
offense--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--such
a
rule
would
not
have
a...
a
substantial
impact
on
federal
prosecutions.
we
adhere
to--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--no.
i
think
i
am...
i
think
it's
different--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--i
think
it
would
be
unwise
for
the
court
to
take
the
step
of
reading
beck
as
imposing
an
elements
test
as
a
matter
of
federal
constitutional
law.
so
the
answer,
in
essence,
is
no,
i
don't
think
that
beck
requires
the
conclusion
that
state
courts
are
obliged
to
submit
any
lesser
that
would
be
a
lesser
offense
under
the
elements
test
under
federal
law.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
had...
had...
had
respondent
framed
this
issue
for
the
nebraska
courts,
they
ought
to
have.
but
respondent
did
not.
i
think
the--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--respondent,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
has
never
suggested,
until
this
court...
in
fact,
it's
never
been
suggested
by
anyone
until
this
court...
that
if
you
apply
an
elements
test,
involuntary
manslaughter,
unlawful
act
manslaughter,
is
not
a
lesser...
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
they
never
mentioned
that
theory
at
all.
all
they
did
is...
and
in
the
joint
appendix,
at
30,
is
where
there's
the
instruction
which
they
proposed.
it
did
refer
to
unlawful
act
manslaughter
as
one
of
the
alternative
lessers
that...
that
they
sought
to
get.
but
when
they
were
explaining
to
the
trial
court
why
they
were
entitled
to
defense
instructions
on
second
degree
murder
and
manslaughter,
at
no
point
did
they
focus
on
involuntary
act
manslaughter,
did
they
suggest
that
under
an
elements
test
it
would
be
a
lesser,
did
they
suggest
that
there
was
any
particular
unlawful
act
that
would
be
appropriate
in
this
particular
case.
those
issues
were
never
confronted,
so
far
as
i'm
aware,
until...
in
respondent's
brief
in
this
court.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
no.
and
the
eighth
circuit's
analysis,
again,
is
completely
different.
the
analysis
of
the
eighth
circuit
is
that
it
is
irrelevant
to
the
beck
question
whether
these
would
be
lesser
included
offenses
or
not.
and
that's
the
ruling
that
we
sought
to
participate,
because
we
object
to
it
and
because
it
would
have
a
substantial
impact
on
federal
prosecution.
that
ruling,
which
would
constitutionalize
a
lesser
unincluded
offense
doctrine
that
this
court...
this
court
has
repudiated
in
schmuck
and
in
dixon,
is
entirely
untenable.
i...
i
should
try
to
mention
one
thing
about
nebraska
law,
although
i
don't
profess
to
expertise
in
it.
i
think
that
there
is
at
least
one
possible
respect...
again,
i'm
speculating,
because
nebraska
has
never
confronted
this
question...
in
which
involuntary
act
manslaughter
might
not
be
a
lesser
included
offense
even
on
an
elements
test.
if
you
look
at
the
statute
which
defines
unlawful
act
manslaughter,
it
requires...
it
appears
to
require
that
the
murder
in
fact
be
unintentional
rather
than...
rather
than
intentional.
if,
as
there
is
some
suggestion
in
nebraska
law,
that
that's
an
element
of
the
offense,
that
you
can't
have
an
intentional
killing
that
would
be
an
involuntary
manslaughter,
then
they
are
not
greater
and
lesser.
because
i
could
commit
a
felony
murder
through
an
intentional
killing
in
the
course
of
a
felony
that
would
not
be
eligible
for
treatment
as
an
involuntary
manslaughter.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
second
degree
murder
was
not
a
lesser
included
offense
because
it
requires
an
intent
to
kill.
now,
tyson
and
enmund
do
not
require
at
any
phase
of
the
proceedings
a
determination
that
the
defendant
intended
to
kill.
what
they
require...
what
they
clearly
require
is
that
with
respect
to
someone
who
is
not
the
actual
killer...
not
this
situation,
by
the
way...
that
there
be
some
culpable
state
shown
with
respect
to
the
killing,
and
at
least...
well,
some
culpable
state--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--the
lower
courts
have
taken
that
view
of
enmund.
but
the
other
problem
with
the
reliance
upon
enmund
as
affecting
the
beck
analysis
is
that
this
court,
in
cabana,
made
very
clear
that
that's
not
a
determination
that
is
relevant
to
the
state's
power
to
define
the
elements
of
capital
offenses.
it
is
a
determination
that
is
relevant
solely
at
the
time
of
sentencing
to
determine
whether
or
not
a
capital
sentence
can
in
fact
be
imposed.
and
so
it...
i
don't...
i
think
it's--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--again,
i
don't
believe
so.
there
are
many
aspects
of
capital
sentencing
that
may
or
may
not
be...
may
arise
in
the
sentencing
proceedings
that
the
state
is
not
obliged
to
affirmatively
establish
at
the
time
of
the...
the
trial.
and,
again,
it's
important
that,
even
on
the
broadest
reading
of
tyson
and
enmund,
there
is
no
requirement
of
a
showing
of
actual
intent
to
kill
as
opposed
to
a
far
less
demanding
culpable
state.
so
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
say
that
there
is
anything
close
to
a
direct
tension,
leaving
aside
the
procedural
differences
between
the
tyson/enmund
line
of
cases
and
the
state's
approach
to
the
definition
of
felony
murder
or
its...
of
lesser
grades
of
homicide.
but
just
to
complete
the
thought
about
nebraska
law
and
why
it
may
well
be
the
case
under
nebraska
law
that
involuntary
manslaughter
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense
even
under
an
elements
test.
in
a
case
cited
in
respondent's
brief,
the
alzubaidy
case,
which
i
think
is
reported
at
559,
northwest
2d,
the
nebraska
court
of
appeals
held
that
in
fact
there's
no
such
thing
as
attempted
involuntary
manslaughter.
and
when
it
said
that,
it
said
because
attempt
carries
with
it
the
idea
that
you
are
intending
to
commit
the
offense
in
question.
and
involuntary
manslaughter
has
a
constituted
feature
of
it
that
it
is
an
unintentional
killing.
and
that
mode
of
analysis,
if
applied
here,
i
think
would
strongly
suggest
that
in
fact
applying
an
elements
test,
that
involuntary
manslaughter
is
not
a
lesser
included
offense.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
yes.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
yes.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
this
court,
in
cabana,
made
clear
that
that
principle,
that
at
least
with
people
who
are
not
the
actual
killers,
there
may
be
a
requirement
of
culpable
mental
state,
is
not
one
that
affects
the
power
of
the
state
to
define
the
elements
of
the
offense.
it's
purely
a
sentencing
issue
and
therefore
should
not
affect
the
beck
analysis.
