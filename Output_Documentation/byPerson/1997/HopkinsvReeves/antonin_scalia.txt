what
do
you
mean
by
lesser
unincluded
offenses?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
a
state
can
do
that.
i
mean,
you...
you...
you
don't
deny
that
a
state
can
do
that
by
simply
establishing
crimes
that
don't...
a
capital
crime
that
has
no
lesser
included
offense,
however
you
want
to
define
it...
by
elements,
by
facts,
whatever...
a
state
can
do
that,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
state...
a
state
cannot
set
up
its
crimes
in
such
a
way
that
you
have
one
capital
crime
which
has
no
lesser
included
offense?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
the
state,
in
beck,
said
that
there
was...
that...
had
the
state,
in
beck,
said
that
there
was
no
lesser
included
offense,
or
had
it
said
that
there
is
a
lesser
included
offense,
but
we
don't
care,
we're
not
going
to
charge
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
latter.
there's
no
meaningful
distinction
between...
between
a
state
saying,
for
this
crime
there
is
no
lesser
included
offense
and
a
state
saying
there
is
one,
but
we're
not
going
to
allow
it
to
be
charged
in
a
capital
case?
i
think
there's
a
big
distinction
between
the
two.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when
you
say
it's
quite
obvious
that
there
is
one,
that
depends
on...
on
how
you
define
lesser
included
offense,
whether
that's
a
federal...
a
federal
concept...
and
there
are
some...
some
logical
rules
based
upon
the
elements
or
upon
what's
proven
at
trial,
or
whether
what's
a
lesser
included
offense
depends
on
whatever
the
state
says
is
a
lesser
included
offense.
that's
a
conceivable
thing,
isn't
it?
