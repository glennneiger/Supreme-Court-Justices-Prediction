justice
david
h.
souter
was...
was
the
manslaughter
that
he
asked
for
the
instruction
on
involuntary
manslaughter,
in
other
words
killing
in
the
course
of
committing
an
unlawful
act?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
would
he
have
been
correct
if...
if
he
had
asked
for
that?
isn't
that
a
lesser
included
of...
of
the
felony
murder
charged
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
know.
they
have
said
that.
i
don't
understand
why--
justice
david
h.
souter
--what...
what
about
the...
what
about
the
lesser
sexual...
isn't
there
is...
what
is
it...
i
guess
second
degree
sexual
assault,
which...
which
does
not
involve
penetration?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
he
could...
he...
i
mean,
if
he
wanted
to,
he
could
charge
it,
couldn't
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
we
assume
that
such
a
charge
is
possible
under
nebraska
law,
then
why
isn't
it
a
lesser
included
of
the
charge
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
why
isn't
this...
if...
if...
if
he
had...
and
i'm
not
sure
that
he
clearly
asked
for
this...
but
if
he
had
said,
i
want
an...
an
instruction
on
the
lesser
included
offense
of
involuntary
manslaughter
and
the
unlawful
act
that
i
have
in
mind
is,
if
i've
got
this
right
second...
second
degree
sexual
assault,
why
would
that
not
have
been
a
request
for
a
lesser
included...
an
instruction
on
a
lesser
included
offense
within
the
meaning
of
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
just...
just
as
an
analytical
matter.
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
but
you're
saying
the
prosecutor
might
not
have
brought
this
as
an
original
charge.
and
i...
i
can
see
your
point.
i
understand
the
point
that
you're
making.
but
i
don't...
i
guess
i
don't
understand
why,
within
the
meaning
of
beck,
this
involuntary
manslaughter,
when
the...
when
the
underlying
offense
is
second
degree
sexual
assault,
is
not,
just
as
an
analytical
matter,
a
lesser
included
offense
within
the
meaning
of
beck.
there
may
be
other
reasons
why
beck
doesn't
apply
here,
but
i
just
want
to
get
straight
that
if
he
had
asked
for
it,
that
either
would
or
would
not
have
been
a...
a
welltaken
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
strikes
me
as
though
it
would
be
a
welltaken
point.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
assume
that...
that
beck's...
well,
i'm
not
sure.
i
mean,
i...
i
thought
beck
probably
assumed
that
there...
for
purposes
of
beck,
that
there
was
a
federal
definition
of
what
a
lesser
included
offense
is.
but
assuming...
assuming
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
lesser
included
offense
under
beck
is...
is
a...
is
a...
is
a...
a
federal
term,
subject
to
federal
definition,
would
this,
just
as
an
analytical
matter,
have
been
a
lesser
included
offense?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i'm...
i'm
just
saying
assume
it
for
the
sake
of
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
what
is
the
difference...
what
is
difference
in
the
elements?
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
answer
to
justice
stevens.
but
i
thought
part
of
your
answer
was
that
in
fact
his
hypothesis
really
was
not
posing
a
difference
offense.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
so
that
the
elements...
i...
i
mean,
i
took
that
as
meaning
that
the...
that
the
elements
of
the
involuntary
manslaughter,
where
a
sexual
assault
was
involved,
is
the
same
as
the
elements
for
felony
murder,
where
a
sexual
assault
is
involved.
are...
is...
are
those
identical
in
your
view?
is
that
what
you're
telling
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
a
prosecutor...
so
a
prosecutor
could
have
charged
either
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
said
i've
got...
i've
got...
i've
got
an
offense
consisting
of
the
following
elements
here.
and
i
can
either
go
for
the
death
penalty
or
i
can
go
for
a...
a...
a
lowlevel
criminal
offense
with
a
couple
of
years.
he
could
have
made
that
decision?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
in
that
case,
the...
the
prosecutor
is
charging
different
elements.
here
he's
charging
on
your...
as
i
understand
you,
exactly
the
same
elements.
so
he
can
say,
gee,
we'll
either
hang
a
person
or...
or
give
them
a
couple
of
years
in...
in
prison.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't...
doesn't
that
raise
the...
because
of
that...
that
enormous
disparity,
doesn't
that
raise
the...
an
even
worse
problem
that...
that
beck
was
concerned
with?
justice
david
h.
souter
general,
it
seems
to
me...
may
i
go
back
to
justice
stevens'
question.
because
i
think
the...
the
question
that
justice
stevens
was
asking
probably
is
the
same
as
the
one
that
i...
i've
been
asking.
and
that
is,
simply
based
on
an
analysis
of
the
elements,
isn't
there,
under
a
nebraska
law,
a
lesser
included
offense
here
of
involuntary
manslaughter
when
the
elements
of
involuntary
manslaughter
consist
of
an
unintentional
killing
together
with
a
second
degree
sexual
assault?
just
as
an
analytical
matter,
that's...
that's
lesser
included,
isn't
it?
because
it...
it...
it
has...
it
has...
it...
it
is
distinguished
from
the
charge
in
this
case
in
the
following
way
in
this
case,
the
charge
was
killing
in
the
course
of
first
degree
sexual
assault
or
attempted
first
degree
sexual
assault.
and
in
order
to
prove
first
degree
sexual
assault
you
had
to
prove
penetration.
and
in
order
to...
to
prove
the...
the
attempt,
you
had
to
prove
an
intended
penetration.
under
the
second
degree
sexual
assault,
you
don't
have
to
prove
penetration.
so
why
isn't
the
unintended
killing
in
the
course
of
committing
a
second
degree
sexual
assault
lesser
included
just
based
on
the
analysis
of
elements?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
but
that...
that
simply
says
why
a
prosecutor
wouldn't
bring
it.
i'm
saying
why
isn't
it,
as
a
matter
of
elements,
a
lesser
included?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
why.
but
they
seem
to
have
done
so.
why
isn't
it
lesser
included?
justice
david
h.
souter
under
enmund
v.
florida,
you
don't
have
to
have
an
intent
to
kill?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may
not
have
to
be
specified
in
the
information,
but
i
presume
you
have
to
explain
to
the
trial
judge
what
the
predicate
is
for
your
request
for
the
instruction?
