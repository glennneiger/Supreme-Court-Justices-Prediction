mr.
john
w.
rogers
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government's
essential-but-not-essential-all-the-time
elements
test
has
no
objective
content
and,
if
applied
consistently,
will
produce
absurd
results
that
violate
the
constitutional
venue
provisions.
in
contrast,
the
framework
that
respondent
offers
is
the
analysis
that
this
court
has
used
over
and
over
again
when
it
has
confronted
a
venue
question
in
this
century.
it's
what
it
did
in
armour
packing,
it's
what
it
did
in
freeman,
lombardo,
mid-state
horticultural
company,
johnson,
anderson,
johnston,
cores,
and
travis.
that
is,
it
looked
at
the
statute
and
said,
what
is
the
proscribed
conduct,
and
then...
the
actus
reis...
and
then
it
said,
where
was
that
conduct
performed,
and
then,
that
is
where
venue
lies.
the
government's
essential
elements
test
abandons
this
precedent
and
offers
an
unworkable
result.
money-laundering
is
conducting
a
financial
transaction
under
certain
circumstances
in
the
case
of
a
1956
violation,
and
it's
engaging
in
a
monetary
transaction
in
a
1957
violation.
clearly,
the
conducts
that's
prohibited
are
the
proscribed
financial
transactions.
they
have
nothing...
it
is
not
the
narcotics
activity.
that
is
a
separate
and
distinct
crime.
in
that
sense,
this
is
a
straightforward
case
of
statutory
construction.
this
is
simply
not
a
continuing
offense.
it's
a
crime
that
was
committed
entirely
within
florida,
and
that
is
where
it
should
be
prosecuted.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i
think
that
if
congress
was
to
define
money
laundering
where
venue
would
be
proper
where
the
underlying
unlawful
activity--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--i
believe
that
statute
would
violate
the
constitution
when...
in
the
cases
when
the
crime
was
not
committed
where
it's
tried,
so
i
don't
think
that
that
would
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i
think...
i
believe
the
constitution
compels
that
the
trial
be
had
where
the
crime
is
committed,
and
if
the
trial
is
not
had
where
the
crime
is
committed,
i
think
it
will
violate
the
constitution.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
well,
this
court
has
said
when
it...
to
look...
to
determine
where
the
crime
is
committed,
you
must
look
at
the
acts
of
the
defendant
that
violate
the
statute,
and
that's
why
you
can't
divorce
what
the
proscribed
conduct
is
from
the
constitution.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
she
could
be
tried
in
missouri--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--if
it
was
a
conspiracy
to
launder
money,
possibly,
under
that
hypothetical,
she
could
be.
she
could
not
be
tried
in
missouri
for
a
subsequent
violation
of
money
laundering.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
she
was.
that's
count
i
of
the
indictment.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
well,
conspiracy,
of
course,
punishes
the
agreement
to
commit
the
illegal
act,
so
in
the
sense
that
the
agreement
was
formed
in
missouri
and
there
were
overt
acts
in
missouri,
venue
would
be
proper
for
a
conspiracy
prosecution
in
missouri.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's
what
hyde
holds.
this,
of
course,
isn't
a
conspiracy...
this
case
doesn't
involve
a
conspiracy.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
in
both
those
cases,
in
the
conspiracy
context
and
in
the
aiding
and
abetting
context,
you
have
a
situation
where
the
defendant
herself
or
himself
would
be
legally
liable
for
the
conduct
of
another,
so
in
that
sense
the
crime
is
committed
in
that
district
where
the
other
acts
that
they're
legally
liable
for.
you
do
not
have
that
in
a
substantive
violation
of
money
laundering.
there
is
no
acts
of
others
that
the
defendant's
legally
liable
for.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
aiding
and
abetting
is...
by
a
statutory
matter
it
says
that
an
aider
and
abettor
can
be
prosecuted
as
a
principal,
so
in
that
sense
i
think
the
aider
and
abettor
is
legally
liable
for
the
actions
of
the
principal.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
venue
has
to
be
looked
at
for
each
crime
that
is
charged.
while
the
conspiracy
to
launder
money
may
or
may
not
be
proper
in
missouri
based
on
the
proof
that
the
government
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
make,
it's
clearly
not
proper
for
the
substantive
violation
of
money
laundering.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
conspiracy
is
not
at
issue
in...
on...
in
this
case
at
all.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
no,
that's
not
correct,
your
honor.
i
did--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--i
filed
the
motion
to
dismiss
based
on
all
three
counts
on
venue.
the
district
court
sustained
it
as
to
the
two
substantive
violations,
denied
it
as
to
the
conspiracy.
i
believe
that
that
was
a
correct
decision,
not
because
i
believe
venue's
proper
on
conspiracy,
but
i
think
the
government
should
have
an
opportunity
to
be
able
to
prove
that
venue's
proper
on
a
conspiracy,
meaning
they
should
have
an
opportunity
to
prove
that
the
agreement
was
formed
in
missouri,
overt
acts
were
carried
out
in
missouri
and,
thus,
the
prosecution
can
properly
lie
in
missouri.
on...
as
far
as
the
substantive
violations
that
the
district
court
did
dismiss,
they
failed
on
their
face.
there
is
no
possible
way
venue
is
proper
on
those
two
cases,
and
that's
why
they
were
dismissed.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--that
is
correct.
the
government
made
an
interlocutory
appeal
on
the
two
dismissed
counts,
and
so
at
the
eighth
circuit,
they,
likewise,
didn't
consider
the
conspiracy
issue
at
all.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
if
they
were,
in
fact...
i...
if...
in
that
situation,
if
they
in
fact--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--that
is
correct,
justice--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--or
she
would
have
to
aid
and
abet
the
drug
dealing.
they
would
have
to
prove
that
because
that
would
be
what
the
statute
would...
that
would
be
the
proscribed
conduct
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
that's...
in
your
hypothetical--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--if
that's
what
the
statute--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--yes.
i
think
if
that
is
what
the
statute
said,
and
they
in
fact
aided
and
abetted
the
drug
dealers
by
laundering
their
money--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--then
you
could
be
proper
where
the
underlying
illegal
activity
happened.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
it's
not
a
constitutional
protection,
since
because
what
you
have
done
is,
you
have
created
a
statute
that
penalizes
different
conduct
than
the
money-laundering
statutes
at
issue.
of
course,
if
you
had...
if
the
statute
said,
anyone
who
participates
in
a
narcotics
enterprise
by
agreeing
to
launder
their
money,
they
could
be
prosecuted
in
missouri.
i
agree
with
you
completely.
but
in
that
sense,
they
would
be
involved--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--and
they
would
be
legally
liable
for
the
people
that--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--on
the
hypothetical
that
justice
scalia
gave,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
follow
that.
i--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--well,
i
think
you
would
dismiss
it
for
failure
of
proof
on
the
substantive--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--that
they
aided
and
abetted,
yes,
and--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--once
again,
i
think
my
answer
would
be
the
same.
i
think
it
would
be
a
failure
of
proof
on
the
aiding
and
abetting
count,
and
if
there
was
enough
to
go
to
a
jury
on
the
substantive
violation,
it
would
go
to
a
jury.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
oh,
no,
no.
i
misunderstood
what
you
were
asking.
venue
has
to
be
proper
for
each
count
that's
charged.
you
can't
bootstrap
venue
by
getting
venue
proper
on
one
count
and
then
saying
it's
proper
for
any
count
we
choose...
that
the
government
chooses
to
join.
i
clearly--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--correct.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
in
that
sense,
this
is
no
different
from
many
cases
where,
if
you
have
a
huge
conspiracy
of
a
criminal
enterprise,
that
they
can...
the
government
can
only
join
the
counts
in
the
district
where
the
crime
was
committed
if
they
were...
even
if
they
were
substantive
violations
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy.
they
can't
bring
those
substantive
violations
that
weren't
committed
in
the
district.
they
have
to
choose
the
best
district
where
the
crime
was
committed
and,
of
course,
if
it's...
they
could...
for
sentencing
purposes
they
could,
of
course,
bring
that
in
as
relevant
conduct
as--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--there's--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--you're
right
on
the
money,
your
honor.
there's
very
little
difference.
when
you
have
a
conspiracy
count
and
an
aiding
and
abetting,
this
case
becomes
very
unimportant.
i
don't
see
the
importance
to
it
as
far
as
the
government's
concerned.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
your
honor,
if
i
said
that
just
because
the
government
said
she
aided
and
abetted,
venue
would
be
proper
in
missouri,
i
clearly
misspoke.
the
government
would
need
to
prove
she
aided
and
abetted.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i
go
back
to
the
constitution.
you...
if
the
government
defines
a
crime
where
the
act
of
the
crime
is
committed
in
a
certain
district,
venue's
proper.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i...
the
difference--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--well,
for
constitutional
purposes,
in
an
aiding
and
abetting
situation
you're
legally
liable
for
the
acts
of
others,
so
the
crime
can
be
committed.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
in
an
aiding
and
abetting
situation,
i
don't
disagree
with
that.
of
course,
this--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--your
honor--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--thank
you,
your
honor,
and
you
are
absolutely
correct.
[laughter]
in
a
situation
when
you're
an
accessory
after
the
fact--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--if
you
are
an
accessory
after
the
fact
you
aren't
legally
liable
for
the
principals.
that
is
a...
and
that,
you're
absolutely
right,
and
that
was
briefed
in
the
brief,
and
i
think
an
accessory
after
the
fact
is
a
totally
different
situation,
regardless
if,
congress
named
it
aiding
and
abetting
and
then
essentially
passed
an
accessory-after-the-fact
statute.
i
agree
with
that.
as
far
as
the...
the
government's
put
forth
two
primary
arguments,
and
one
is
that
we
can
base
venue
on
an
act
of
confederates.
i
think
that
clearly
is
not
the
case
that
we've
discussed
so
far.
the
other
one
is
that
the
effects
of
the
crime
are
somehow
felt
in
missouri.
i
think
that
in
that
situation
we're
getting...
this
is
a
very,
very
attenuated
and
very,
very
abstract
effects
argument.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
sure.
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any
difference
for
venue
analysis.
i
think
if
you...
for
instance,
if
the
unabomber
sent
a
bomb
to
new
jersey
and
intended
to
kill
the
president
of
a
corporation
and
intended
to
harm
that
corporation,
that
doesn't
mean
venue's
proper
where
the
harm
is
felt.
same
if
you
commit
murder
and
the
widow
is
obviously
affected
by
the
murder
that
was
committed,
and
even
if
you
meant
to
affect
the
widow,
that
doesn't
mean
venue's
proper
there.
the
crimes
that
are
able
to
be
had
where
the
effect
is
felt
are
the
crimes
that
are
defined
as
in
causing
a
certain
result,
like
murder.
it's
not...
that's
not
defined
as
in
terms
of
an
act,
like
shooting.
it's
defined
as
in
causing
the
death
of
a
person,
so
where
you
cause
the
death
of
that
person,
yes,
venue
would
be
proper.
the
same
is
true
of
obstruction
of
justice.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i
believe
that
in
certain
situations
that
if
you
have
a...
where
you
commit
the...
like,
if
i
shot
someone
and
they
didn't
die,
and
then
they
stumbled
over
to
a
different
district
and
died,
i
believe
that's
one
of
the
rare
situations
when
murder
probably
could
be
a
continuing
offense,
and
would
be
proper
where
the
act
of
the...
was
committed
and
where
the
result
was
caused
in
that
sense.
i
wouldn't
have
a
problem
with
that
analysis.
it's
kind
of
a
far-fetched
hypothetical
and
it
probably
wouldn't
happen
very
much,
but
at
least
in
that--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--well,
i
think
that...
go
back
to
the
unabomber
example.
i
think
that
you
could
look
at
the
act
as
mailing...
or
making
a
bomb
and
mailing
it,
and
the
person
dies
halfway
across
the
country,
but
i
think
they
can
clearly
be
tried--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--i'd
have
to
agree
with
you.
i
think
i
was
getting
a
little
carried
away
with
myself.
i
think
in
the
sense
where
murder
can
be
a
continuing
offense
is
where
the
act
crosses
the...
in
a
sense
where
you
shoot
a
gun
across
the
border
of--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--i
think
that
if
you...
i'm
not...
i...
were...
i
don't
think
that
if
the
person
was
shot
in
one
district
and
then
somehow
they
hopped
on
a
plane
and
went
somewhere
else,
i
don't
think
that
state
would
properly
be
able
to
try
a
murder
prosecution
there.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
well,
if
the
statute
was--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--sure.
if
the
statute
was
defined
as
then
causing
the
narcotics
enterprise
to
continue
their
activities
by
agreeing
to
launder
their
money,
i
think
in
that
sense
that
they
properly
could
be
tried
there.
of
course,
that's
an
entirely
different
crime
than
what
the
government's
charged
ms.
cabrales
with
in
this
case.
they
charge
her
with
the
substantive
act
of
engaging
in
a
financial
transaction
with...
under
certain
circumstances
with
dirty
money.
that
is
a
far
cry
from
a
situation
where
someone's...
someone
where
the
statute's
defined
in
the
terms
of
causing
a
drug
enterprise
or
a
narcotics
enterprise
to
continue.
and,
in
fact,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
prosecute
her
under
this
statute
because
she...
the
money
laundering,
even
if
it
did
occur,
didn't
cause
any
drug
enterprise
to
continue
at
all.
they
were...
the
narcotics...
as
the
government
points
out,
they've
been
convicted
and
tried.
it's
clearly
stopped.
the
money
laundering
was
something
that
happened
after
the
fact.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
well,
in
that
situation,
in
the
crime
you're
talking
about,
you've
got
a...
you
could
have
a
conspiracy
to
launder
money,
or
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
drugs.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i...
frankly,
i
don't
know
who
transported
the
money.
i...
there
hasn't
been
a
trial
on
this.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
assuming
the
money
was
transported...
assuming
the
money
was
transported,
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
substantive
violation
of
money
laundering.
the
statute
doesn't
prohibit
transporting
dirty
money.
it
prohibits--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--i
couldn't
speak
for
the
government
on
that
issue.
i
don't
know
why
they
did
that.
maybe
because
they
are
looking
for
a
certain
rule
of
law
out
of
this
case.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
i
just
don't
know.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
rogers
as
the
exchange
between
mr.
rogers
and
justices
scalia
and
souter
indicates,
really
the
respondent's
position
stands
or
falls
with
the
proposition
that
there
is
a
constitutionally
significant
difference
between
being
an
aider
and
abettor
and
being
an
accessory
after
the
fact,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
congress
has
chosen
to
define
an
aider
and
abettor
as--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--i
think
if
we
can
prove
the
conspiracy
charge,
then
presumably
the
money
laundering--
mr.
john
w.
rogers
--itself
would
be
relevant
conduct
and
probably
the
end
result
would
be
negligible.
it's
not
necessarily
the
case
that
we
could
prove
conspiracy
simply
because
we
could
prove
a
substantive
money...
thank
you,
your
honor.
