unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference
at
all,
mr.
stewart,
whether
the
defendant
had
any
knowledge
of
the
circumstances
of
the
predicate
offense
or
any
link
at
all
with
the
state
in
which
that
was
carried
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
defendant
presumably
could
have
been
told
by
somebody,
look,
i
got
these
funds
illegally.
maybe
the
defendant
is
told
that
in
the
state
of
new
york
by
someone
from
missouri,
and
the
someone
says,
these
are
illegally
obtained
funds
but
i
need
your
help
to
put
them
in
a
bank
and
do
such-and-such
with
them.
is
that
enough
to
prosecute
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
defendant
doesn't
know
that
the
crime
occurred
in
missouri
and--
unknown
speaker
--was
never
there.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
cases
do
you
think
justify
that
particular
approach?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
it's
a
little
easier
to
see,
isn't
it,
in
a
conspiracy
context.
of
course,
you
have
a
conspiracy
charge
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
receiving
stolen
property,
one
of
the
examples
mentioned,
i
think,
in
one
of
the
briefs.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
the
property
is
stolen
in
state
a,
and
then
it's
received
and
resold
in
state
b.--
unknown
speaker
--well,
how
does
receiving
stolen
property
in
new
york
conceal
the
existence
of
a
crime,
say,
in
chicago?
unknown
speaker
i
can
see
how
it
facilitates
it,
but
to
say
it
conceals
it,
i
really
don't
follow
that.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
on
your
theory...
how
do
you
feel
about
controlled
substances?
i
mean,
there
are
quite
a
few
that
the
attorney
general
has
to
put
on
a
list
or
they're
not
controlled,
so
does
that
mean
as
to
any
such
substance
every
drug
crime
could
be
prosecuted,
wherever
it
takes
place,
in
washington,
d.c.?
unknown
speaker
no,
it's
not
conduct
exactly.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
an
element
of
the
offense?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
the
substance
is
not
on
the
list,
then
you
can't
prosecute
the
person
for
the
offense.
unknown
speaker
oh--
--element
of
an
offense
is
not
a
separate
justification,
as
you
said
in
your
initial
presentation.
unknown
speaker
is
it
or
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
sufficient,
then.
unknown
speaker
so
what
else
do
you...
i
mean,
it's...
your
theory
is
that
although
all
the
conduct
relevant
here
took
place
in
florida,
i
take
it,
but
there
was
some
element
of
the
offense
that
took
place
in
a
different
state,
that
that
element
of
the
offense
does
give
venue,
but
my
element
of
the
offense,
putting
the
drug
on
the
list,
doesn't
give
venue,
because?
unknown
speaker
yes,
all
the
conduct...
and
similarly
the
attorney
general's
conduct
of
putting
a
drug
on
a
list
took
place
in
washington,
d.c.,
but
that
conduct
which
created
an
element
of
the
offense
does
not
count
for
venue,
but
here
the
conduct
of
the
activity
and
element
of
the
offense
in
missouri
does,
because--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
really
think
that
provision
was
designed
to
protect
the
government's
interest
in
getting
evidence?
unknown
speaker
not
to
protect
the
defendant's
interest--
unknown
speaker
--in
being
tried
at
home?
unknown
speaker
prevent
him
from
being
tried
where
he
goes
and
commits
a
crime.
but
to
let
him
be
tried
where
somebody
else
committed
a
crime
across
the
country
and
shipped
goods
to
him
he
fenced,
that's
a
rather
novel
proposition.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
in
the
constitution...
this
is
mentioned
twice
in
the
constitution,
and
in
the
sixth
amendment
it
says,
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right,
so
apparently
the
people
who
wrote
that
thought...
the
right
to
be
tried
in
the
district
wherein
the
crime
shall
have
been
committed,
enjoy
the
right.
so
it's
a
little
hard
to
say
that
they
saw
that
mainly
in
terms
of
where...
the
convenience
of
the
prosecution,
as
opposed
to
the
right
of
the
defendant.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
the
idea
of
the
jury
of
the
vicinity
where
the
act
was
committed,
and
you
have
dealt
with
the
attorney
general
and
the
list,
but
what
crimes?
to
get
an
idea
of
the
dimensions
of
what
we're
talking
about,
so
far
you've
mentioned
receiving
stolen
property
would
be
analyzed
the
same
way
as
money-laundering.
there's
one
example
in
the
cases
of
jury
tampering.
the
jury
is
sitting
in
d.c.
but
the
tampering
is
done
in
maryland.
what
else?
what
other
crimes
present
this
problem,
where
all
of
the
conduct
is
in
one
state,
but
it's
in
aid
of
something
that
went
on
earlier
in
another
state?
unknown
speaker
but
that--
--that,
like
conspiracy,
is
a
crime
where
you
are
being
held
responsible
for
acts
done
by
other
people.
i
think
you
have
to
set
aside
aiding
and
abetting,
just
as
you
set
aside
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
could
take
the
substance
of
it,
is
what
i'm...
let's
assume
we're
talking
about
just
a
single
defendant,
no
aiding
and
abetting,
so
i
know
from
the
cases
that
there's
receiving
stolen
property,
and
there's
jury
tampering,
and
there's
money-laundering.
what
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
it,
or
she
is
using
the
mails
wherever
she
sends
her
letter.
she's
using
the
mails
where
it's
received,
she's
using
the
mails
where
it's
transported
through.
i
don't
think
that's
a
good
example.
unknown
speaker
oh,
sure,
but
that's
not
the
contention
being
made
here
by
the
defendant,
i
don't
think.
and
the
palliser
case
really
is
the
mailing
in
one
district
to
a
postmaster
in
another
district
a
solicitation
that's
unlawful,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
falls
considerably
short
of
showing
that
the
government
should
prevail
here.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
palliser.
unknown
speaker
have
you
read
the
trollope
novels,
the
palliser
novels?
i
think
those
are
always
pronounced
palliser.
unknown
speaker
so
your--
--well,
but
there's
a
difference,
it
seems
to
me,
in
prospective
and
retroactive.
under
your
view,
as
i
understand
it,
if
methamphetamine
is
manufactured
in
arizona
and
it
goes
through
about
four
different
distributors
and
ends
up
in
new
york,
you're
going
to
be
able
to
prosecute
the
new
york,
what
do
you
call
him,
mule,
or
the
ultimate
seller
in
arizona.
i
think
that's
what
you're
saying,
and...
but
that's,
to
me,
backward-looking.
now,
if
he...
if
the
defendant
intends
to
cause
or
should
know
that
what
he
does
will
have
a
prospective
effect
in
some
other
jurisdiction,
that's
quite
different.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
backing
away
from
my
description
of
your
position
as
to
the
meth
prosecution
being
in
arizona,
even
though
it
was
sold
by
someone
who
has
never
been
in
arizona
and
it's
gone
through
three
different
stages
and
it's
in
new
york
city?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
hypothetical
is
that
meth
is
manufactured
in
arizona,
it's
sold
by
two
or
three
different
people,
and
it's
finally
sold
by
some
guy
on
the
street
in
new
york,
and
it
seems
to
me,
under
your
point
of
view,
this
street
seller
can
be
prosecuted
in
arizona,
because
that...
it
makes
the
meth
laboratory
work
to
have
this
little
distribution
network.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
relying
on
elements
of
the
crime.
unknown
speaker
use
justice
kennedy's
example
with
counterfeiting.
unknown
speaker
use
justice
kennedy's
example
with
counterfeiting.
i
mean,
you
have
the
person
passing
the
$10
bill,
but
the
bill
was
counterfeited
in
arizona.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
mean
the
government
doesn't
think
there's
any
harm
in
having
a
counterfeit
organization
in
a
particular
community?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
mr.
stewart,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
that
goes
one
step
further
on
that
question
of
purpose.
the
reason
for
selecting
the
community
that
the
constitution
has
done
in
the
vicinage
provision
historically,
as
i
understand
it,
was
to
select
a
jury
from
the
place
where
the
evidence
was
going
to
be
found.
originally,
if
you
go
far
enough
back,
it
reflects
the
fact
that
the
jury
in
fact
supplied
evidence.
later
on
the
theory
was
still
maintained
and,
as
i
understand
it,
the
theory
was
maintained
in
order
to
prevent
the
crown
or
later
the
government
from
taking
people
from
the
places
where
they
are
accused
of
having
committed
a
crime,
spiriting
them
away
to
another
part
of
the
kingdom,
or
another
part
of
the
country,
where
the
government
can,
with
its
power,
get
all
the
evidence
it
wants,
but
where
the
individual
is
probably
not
going
to
be
very
effective
in
getting
any
defense
evidence.
now,
assuming
that
that...
and
i
think
that's
a
fair
statement
of
at
least
an
important
historical
consideration.
if
that
is
so,
then
it
is
not...
not
only
is
it,
i
suppose,
not
a
positive
justification
for
the
position
that
you
take,
but
it
shows
that
the
kind
of
evidence
that
you
want
to
prove
these
nonact
elements
really
is
the
kind
of
evidence
that
the
provision
is
not
concerned
with
at
all.
for
example,
the
fact
that
the
money
was
counterfeited
somewhere
is
not
an
important
fact.
all
the
government
has
got
to
prove
is
that
the
counterfeiting,
the
counterfeited
bill
was
passed
at
the
place
where
the
defendant
committed
that
particular
crime.
so
that
it
seems
to
me
that
no
purpose
within
the
sixth
amendment
is
served
by
having
a
jury
anywhere
except
in
places
where
the
evidence
either
of
the
cause
or
the
effect
of
the
crime
is
likely
to
be
found,
so
if
we
get
into
purpose,
it
seems
to
me
that
purpose
argues
against
you.
am
i
wrong
in
my
assumption
about
the
purposes?
unknown
speaker
the
counterfeiting
case,
that
wouldn't
apply.
that
reasoning
wouldn't
apply.
i
suppose
that
reasoning
wouldn't
apply
in
the
case
of
the
felon
in
possession
of
the
firearm.
you
pointed
out
in
your
footnote
that
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
place
of
the
firearms
manufacture
would
provide
venue,
but
i
do
suppose
that
on
your
theory
the
place
of
the
predicate
felony
would
be
within
your
choice
of
venue,
and
yet
the
only
thing
you
have
to
prove
is,
in
fact,
that
a
felony
was
committed,
which
you
do
by
record.
there's
no
need
to
go
to
that
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
why
might
it
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
if
that's
what
you're
going
to
rely
on
for
proof
you
would
prosecute
him
for
manufacturing
the
counterfeited
bill
in
the
jurisdiction
in
which
he
did
it.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you
have
to
win
the
counterfeiting
case
in
order
to
win
this
case.
as
i
understand
your
theory
that
you're
giving
us
now,
i'm
not
sure
it
is
the
same
as
the
one
that
was
in
your
briefs.
you
are...
you're
insisting
upon
two
things
before
you
can
try
this
person
in
missouri,
number
1,
that
the
act
which
occurred
in
missouri
be
an
element
of
the
crime,
but
not
that
alone.
in
addition,
that
element
must
be
the
whole
purpose...
in
the
counterfeiting
case
i
guess
you'd
say
must
be
one
of
the
purposes,
but
here
you
say
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
crime
for
which
she's
prosecuted
is
to
prevent
what
occurred
in
missouri,
so
it's
element,
plus
the
whole
purpose
of
the
crime
in
missouri
is
to
prevent
the
drug
dealing
in
missouri.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
say
the
whole
purpose?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
what
do
you
care
if
somebody
launders
money
if
it's
not...
you
know,
you're
trying
to
stop
the
drug-dealing?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
know,
because
you
want
to
reach
further,
but
in
order
to
win
this
case
i
don't
have
to
agree
to
go
any
further,
do
i?
unknown
speaker
well,
sure.
in
the
felon-in-possession
case
you
would
certainly
be
able
to
argue
that
one
reason
for
penalizing
the
possession
of
the
handgun
later
is
to
discourage
felonies
generally,
so
that
the
original
felony
is
within
the
purpose
considered
by
the
felon-in-possession
statute.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
about
your
suggestion
that
the
fact
the
money
was
illegal...
the
taint
of
the
money
occurred
in
missouri
makes
venue
proper
there.
supposing
that
was
everybody's
understanding,
that
the
money
was
tainted,
with
the
proceeds
of
drug
transactions
in
missouri,
but
the
proof
at
the
trial,
they
brought
in
an
accountant
who
proved
yes,
it
was
illegal,
but
actually
illegality
occurred
in
illinois,
would
that
mean
that
the
element
of
the
offense
that
it
was
illegal
money
had
not
been
established?
it
isn't
the
place
where
it
occurs.
it's
what
occurs,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
supposing
you'd
alleged
missouri,
you
thought
it
was,
and
it
turned
out...
on
proof
it
turned
out
they
were
actually
done
right
across
the
river
in
illinois.
unknown
speaker
would
you
lose
the
case?
unknown
speaker
you
would
not.
unknown
speaker
you
would
lose
the
case.
unknown
speaker
it
would
be
dismissed
for
improper
venue.
unknown
speaker
now,
assume
he's
tried
in...
assume
she's
tried
in
florida.
i'm
assuming
there's
no
venue
problem.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
talking
about
the
element
of
the
offense.
when
you
say
the
element
of
the
offense
is
that
the
illegal
drugs
transactions
occurred
in
missouri,
say
you...
they
actually
proved
that
occurred
across
the
river,
would
the
offense
not
have
been
proved?
unknown
speaker
when
the
conduct
that
occurs
in
a
different
place,
like
missouri
here,
is
not
conduct
that
has
been
engaged
in
by
the
defendant,
as
is
true
here,
you
say
it
has
to
be
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
it
has
to
be
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
to
get
at
it?
unknown
speaker
does
that
mean
that
that
act
has
to
be
bad
in
some
way?
i
mean,
what
i'm
thinking
of,
suppose
under
your
test
the
act
in
the
distant
place
considered
apart
from
the
conduct
in
florida,
or
the
close
place,
is
fine.
nothing
wrong
with
an
act
like
that.
it's
only
when
it
takes
place...
that's
true,
of
course,
in
dozens
of
statutes.
i
mean,
then
does
your
test
get
it,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
it
does
get
it.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
if
it
does
get
it,
then
i'm
back
to
my
listing
of
the
drug
in
dozens
of...
because
that's
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
it's
connected...
i
mean,
it's
nothing
wrong
with
it
in
itself,
but
nothing's
wrong
with
a
lot
of
things
in
themselves.
unknown
speaker
sounds
as
if
it's
getting
a
little
ad
hoc,
this
test.
the...
i
mean,
what
i'm
thinking
is,
the
other
case,
of
course,
if
i'm
in
california
and
i
steal
by
mail,
you
know,
something
that
was...
the
property
was
in
new
york,
i
would
have
thought
normally
you
could
try
the
person
in
new
york,
but
there's
nothing
wrong
with
taking
property
in
new
york
and
moving
it
unless,
of
course,
this
conduct
went
on
in
california.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
may
i
ask
you,
what
practical
difference
does
it
make?
you
have
the
conspiracy,
so
you've
got
her
on
that,
and
then
at
sentencing
relevant
conduct
can
be
taken
into
account,
so
what
are
we
talking
about
in
terms
of
the
defendant's
exposure,
whether
you
can
have
it
all
tried
in
missouri,
whether
you
have
to
split
the
trials?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
rogers,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
so
could
congress
provide...
you
say
this
is
a
straight
question
of
statutory
interpretation
that
we
have,
this
venue
statute.
suppose
congress
was
explicit
that
a
place
of
proper
venue
is
the
place
where
the
funds
later
laundered
were
first
generated?
unknown
speaker
that's
not
defining
the
crime.
it's
a
venue
statute
and
it
says,
the
crime
of
money-laundering
defined...
however
it
is
now
defined.
for
that
crime,
the
prosecution
can
be
brought
in
either
of
two
places.
unknown
speaker
so
we're
dealing
not
merely
with
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation,
but
one
that
you
say
is
constitutionally
compelled.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
really
tautological.
i
think
we'd
all
agree
with
that.
that
the
constitution
does
require
that
trial
of
all
crimes
shall
be
held
in
the
state
where
the
crimes
were
committed,
and
if
it's
held
someplace
else,
it
violates
the
constitution,
but
i
think
we
need
a
little
more
fine-tuning
here
than
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
situation,
if
the
government
were
to
allege
and
show
that
the
defendant
had,
indeed,
conspired
and
participated
in
the
drug
offenses
in
missouri
and
had
agreed
that
there
would
be
money-laundering,
could
she
be
tried
in
missouri?
unknown
speaker
for
the
money
laundering
that
occurred
in
florida?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
she--
--well,
how
do
you--
--was
she
charged
with
conspiring
with
missouri
defendants
concerning
laundering
of
drug
proceeds?
unknown
speaker
and
does
that
mean
that
the
laundering
offense
started
in
missouri,
in
effect,
because
that
was
the
conspiracy
agreement?
unknown
speaker
or
even
if
the
agreement
was
formed
in
missouri
and
there...
or
the
agreement
was
formed
in
new
york
and
there
were
overt
acts
in
missouri.
unknown
speaker
but
how
do
you
square
that
with
your
interpretation
of
the
constitution?
how
do
you
square
that?
i
mean,
it's
fine
to
say,
as
i
said
to
mr.
stewart,
that...
you
know,
that
conspiracy
is
different,
and
aiding
and
abetting
is
different,
but
how
do
you
square
treating
them
differently
with
your
constitutional
point?
unknown
speaker
that's...
okay.
that's
so
for
conspiracy.
the
co-conspirators
are
effectively
agents
of
the
defendant,
you
can
say.
what
about
aiding
and
abetting?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogers,
you...
i...
am
i
correct
in
thinking
that
there
is
a
conspiracy
charge
here
against
your
client
in
connection
with
one
of
the
pending
counts?
unknown
speaker
then
why
doesn't
hyde
cover
this
case?
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
substantive
offense,
not
the
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
you
didn't
contest
venue,
or
whoever
was
representing
the
defendant
didn't
contest
venue
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy
count.
unknown
speaker
you
did?
unknown
speaker
but
on
appeal
the
only
question
related
to
the
money
laundering,
not
to
the
conspiracy,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
what's
before
us
for
review.
you
pursued
the
conspiracy
only
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
the...
you
pursued
the
venue
objection
on
the
conspiracy
count
only
in
the
district
court,
not
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
government
enacts
a
statute
that
says,
a
person
who
launders
money
derived
from
a
illegal
enterprise,
drug
sales,
for
example,
shall
be
deemed
an
aider
and
abettor
of
the
illegal
enterprise?
unknown
speaker
this
same
statute,
just
calling
your
client
an
aider
and
abettor
of
the
drug
dealing.
then
she
could
be
prosecuted
in
missouri,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
the
court
just
said
it
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
statute
says
that
the
act
of
enabling
the
drug
dealers
to
get
the
benefit
of
their
drug
dealing
by
rendering
the
money
usable,
laundering
it,
constitutes
aiding
and
abetting
of
the
drug
dealing.
that's
what
the
statute
says.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i'm
making
it
up.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
much
of
a
constitutional
protection,
is
it,
if
it
just
turns
on
how
the
statute
was
framed.
if
you
could
frame
a
statute
that
way,
why
don't
you
say,
effectively
that's
the
same
thing
going
on
here.
then
you
ought
to
be
able
to
try
your
client
in
missouri.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
what
would
happen,
mr.
rogers,
if
your
client
were
charged
with
aiding
and
abetting,
and
that
was
the
only
basis
for
venue
in
missouri,
and
the
court
concluded
after
all
the
evidence
was
in
that
she
may
have
done
something,
but
that
she
did
not
aid
and
abet.
would
that
mean
dismissal
for
want
of
proper
venue?
unknown
speaker
no,
on
the
hypothetical
that
i
gave.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is,
if
the
basis
for
venue
were
a
charge
of
aiding
and
abetting,
and
the
court
were
to
decide
there
just
is
insufficient
evidence
of
aiding
and
abetting
as
to
this
particular
individual,
would
the
next
step
be
to
dismiss
the
case
against
that
individual
for
improper
venue?
unknown
speaker
failure
to
prove
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
what
if
they
were
charged
both
with
a
substantive
offense
and
with
aiding
and
abetting,
and
the
district
court
says,
there's
enough
here
to
go
to
the
jury
on
the
substantive
offense,
but
there
isn't
enough
on
aiding
and
abetting?
unknown
speaker
even
though
were
venue
were
based
only
on
the
aiding
and
abetting?
unknown
speaker
if
that
were
so
there
would
be
no
problem
here,
because
she
was
indicted
on
the
conspiracy
count.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
all
that
matters,
then
you
could
link
the
other
two.
unknown
speaker
that's
one
of
the
questions
i
was
asking
mr.
stewart.
i'm
trying
to
determine
the
practical
consequences
for
your
client,
if
you
should
prevail
and
say,
they
have
to
deal
with
the
money
laundering
in
florida.
still,
let's
say
she's
convicted
of
the
conspiracy
in
missouri,
and
they
can
take
account
of
the
money
laundering
as
relevant
conduct,
what's
the
difference
in
terms
of--
unknown
speaker
--her
exposure?
unknown
speaker
why
is
aiding
and
abetting
different
from
this
statute?
you
say
that
the
government
can
enact
a
statute,
which
is
called
an
aiding
and
abetting
statute,
which
will
render
your
client
liable
to
be
hauled
into
missouri
to
defend
the
case
simply
because
the
government
says
that
the
essence
of
the
crime
is
aiding
and
abetting.
here,
the
government
has
said
that
the
essence
of
the
crime
is
laundering,
not
just
any
money,
or
doing
this
financial
deal
not
just
with
any
money,
but
with
money
that
was
the
product
of
a
drug...
of
a
drug
enterprise.
why
can't...
why
doesn't
that
suffice,
just
as
an
aiding
and
abetting
statute
would,
to
enable
your
client
to
be
tried
in
missouri?
unknown
speaker
no,
when
i
say
the
government
said
it.
i
mean,
the
government
said
it
when
it
enacted
the
statute.
it
simply
defined
the
crime
in
a
way
that
makes
it
an
aiding
and
abetting
crime.
now,
why
is
that
magical?
why
isn't
it
enough
if
the
government
defines
the
crime
in
such
a
way
that
there
has
to
have
occurred
in
missouri,
or
somewhere...
in
this
case
it
happened
in
missouri...
an
unlawful
acquisition
of
money?
unknown
speaker
but
in
aiding
and
abetting,
the
act
that
she's
aiding
and
abetting
did
not
occur
in
florida,
it
occurred
in
missouri,
and
here
the
act
that
she's
facilitating,
the
drug
deal,
did
not
occur
in
florida,
it
occurred
in
missouri.
what's
the
difference--
unknown
speaker
--for
constitutional
purposes?
unknown
speaker
so
here,
you
are
legally
liable...
you're
being
punished
in
part
because
of
the
acts
of
others,
the
drug
transaction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogers,
may
i
interrupt
with
this
suggestion,
because
this
may
be
what's
defeating
the
joinder
here.
don't
you,
on
your
theory,
have
to
make
a
distinction
between
aiding
and
abetting
which,
in
fact,
facilitates
the
commission
of
the
crime
in
the
first
place
and
aiding
and
abetting
after
the
fact
of
the
crime
that
involved
no
pre-criminal
agreement?
your
theory...
the
reason
i
pose
the
question
that
way
is
this.
i
thought
your
theory
for
reconciling
conspiracy
and
aiding
and
abetting
liability
with
the
constitution
was
something
like
this:
the
person
charged
with
aiding
and
abetting
in
effect
is
like
an
agent
of
the
individual
who
actually
commits
the
criminal
act,
what
you
call
the
actus
reis,
and
therefore
when
the
agent
acts,
the
agent
is,
in
fact,
acting
for
the
aider
and
abettor,
acting
for
the
conspirator.
that
works
fine,
it
seems
to
me,
until
you
get
the
situation
in
which
the
person
charged
with
what
we
now
call
aiding
and
abetting
was
the
individual
who,
under
the
old
law,
was
called
the
accessory
after
the
fact
with
no
other
connection,
the
person
in...
you
know,
when
the
crime
is
committed
in
state
a,
the
felon
flees
to
state
b,
goes
to
his
friend
and
says,
i'm
on
the
lam,
let
me
hide
out.
letting
him
hide
out
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
effectiveness
of
the
crime
that
he
committed
in
state
b.
it
simply
has
to
do
with
whether
he's
going
to
get
caught
or
not.
don't
you
have
to
distinguish
between
those
situations
and
say,
when
the
aiding
and
abetting
is
that
kind
of
independent,
after-the-fact
accessory,
then,
in
fact,
you're
in
a
situation
just
like
this
and,
in
fact,
that
would
not
be
a
basis
for
venue
in
the
state
of
the
aiding
and
abetting?
unknown
speaker
take
it,
mr.
rogers,
take
it.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
a
case
in
which
justice
scalia
may
even
agree
with
you.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
suppose
you
intend
the
effects
of
the
crime
to
be
felt
in
missouri,
so
that
there
is
this
prospective
element?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
wouldn't
say
that,
i
mean,
what
if
you...
you
know,
the
unabomber
sends
the
bomb,
it
explodes
and
injures
the
person
in
new
york,
and
he
goes
back
to
darien,
connecticut,
and
dies
in
darien.
is
the
unabomber
triable
in
darien?
unknown
speaker
cases
that
we've
decided
which
allow
a
federal
murder
indictment
where
the
person
died
and
not
where
the
act
which
caused
the
death
was
applied?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
explosion
occurs,
the
act
which
you
produced
occurs
where
the
package
is
received,
and
then
the
person
is
taken
to
another
state
where
he
eventually
dies.
i
wouldn't
think
it's
consistent
with
your
theory
to
say
that
the
government
can
bring
the
indictment
where
the
death
occurs.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
clear
on
your
answer
to
that
question.
you're
talking
about
the
federal
prosecutor,
but
murder
would
ordinarily
be
prosecuted
by
the
state,
and
do
you
mean
to
say
that
the
state
prosecutor
in
connecticut
could
not
bring
in
the
connecticut
state
courts
a
murder
charge
when
somebody
dies
in
connecticut,
even
though
the
poison
was
administered
someplace
else
and
the
person
stumbled
home
before
he
died?
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
the
defendant
intends
the...
his
acts
to
have
effects
which
it's
the
object
of
the
statute
to
prevent.
i'm
thinking
of
your
answer
in
which
the
widow
grieves
in
some
other
state,
but
that...
it's
not
the
object
of
the
statute
to
prevent
those
effects,
but
suppose
in
this
case
the
object
of
the
statute
was
to
make
sure
that
this
drug
ring
could
continue
to
operate
effectively.
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
proof
to
that
effect.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogers,
one
aspect
of
this
puzzles
me
and
that
is,
this
is
presented
to
us
as
a
very
clean
case.
she's
been
charged
just
with
the
money
laundering
in
those
counts,
nothing
with
transporting
it,
and
in
reality
usually
these
questions
don't
come
up
because
it
is
a
continuing
offense.
she's
involved
in
the
original
trafficking,
she's
involved
in
transporting
it
someplace
else
and
in,
finally,
the
money
laundering,
the
beginning,
the
middle
and
the
end.
but
here,
it
was
just
presented
so
cleanly
that
the...
that
no,
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
transporting
the
money.
she
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
original
sales.
that
seemed
to
me
odd.
unknown
speaker
who
did
transport
this
money?
how
is
it
that
she
had
nothing
to
do
with
that?
unknown
speaker
your
answer
should
be,
what
money?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
was
just
wondering
why,
on
the
government's
side,
there
was
this
admission
that
she
wasn't
involved
in
transporting,
or
that
at
least
what
they
charged
doesn't
involve
that.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
was
wondering.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
rogers.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
the
aider
and
abettor,
you've
got
to
aid
something
that
hasn't
yet
happened.
let
me
ask
you
this.
what
difference
does
it
make
to
the
government
in
this
case,
if
you
can
prove
the
conspiracy
charge?
don't
you
get
everything
you
need?
unknown
speaker
would
be
relevant
conduct--
