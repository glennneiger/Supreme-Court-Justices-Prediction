mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
obtain
a
conviction
under
the
federal
money-laundering
statutes,
the
government
must
prove
that
the
defendant
engaged
in
a
financial
transaction,
that
the
property
involved
in
that
transaction
represented
the
proceeds
of
specified
unlawful
activity,
and
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
funds
were
illegally
acquired.
the
government
has
alleged
in
this
case
that
respondent
violated
the
money-laundering
statutes
by
engaging
in
banking
transactions
in
florida
using
funds
that
were
acquired
through
cocaine-trafficking
activities
in
missouri.
the
question
presented
is
whether
venue
was
proper
in
missouri,
the
place
where
the
unlawful
generation
of
funds
is
alleged
to
have
occurred.
this
court's
decisions
have
recognized
two
principal
criteria
on
which
venue
may
be
based.
first,
a
prosecution
may
ordinarily
be
brought
in
any
district
where
conduct
constituting
an
element
of
the
offense
occurs.
second,
where
a
particular
effect
is
an
element
of
a
federal
crime,
the
prosecution
may
generally
be
brought
in
any
district
where
that
effect
is
felt.
for
purposes
of
the
present
case,
the
crucial
point
is
that
neither
of
those
bases
for
laying
venue
requires
that
the
prosecution
be
brought
in
a
district
where
the
defendant
personally
committed
an
unlawful
act.
in
the
government's
view,
missouri
is
an
appropriate
forum
for
this
prosecution
on
both
of
the
foregoing
approaches.
first,
missouri
is
the
place
where
conduct
constituting
an
element
of
the
offense,
namely
the
drug-trafficking
crimes
that
generated
the
laundered
funds,
is
alleged
to
have
occurred.
second,
missouri
is
the
place
where
the
harmful
effects
of
respondent's
money-laundering
were
principally
felt,
since
the
evil
of
money-laundering
consists
of
its
capacity
to
conceal
and
thus
facilitate
the
predicate
crimes.
finally,
trial
in
missouri
furthers
the
purposes
underlying
the
requirement
that
a
criminal
offense
be
prosecuted
at
the
place
where
the
offense
was
committed.
now,
both
article
iii
of
the
constitution
and
the
sixth
amendment
require
that
a
criminal
offense
be
prosecuted
at
the
place
where
the
offense
shall
have
been
committed.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
to
establish
guilt
under
the
money-laundering
statutes
the
defendant
would
have
to
be
shown
to
have
known
that
the
funds
were
illegally
acquired,
so
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--yes,
under
our
view
it
is.
that
is,
the
defendant
must
be
shown
to
have
known
of
the
unlawful
origin
of
the
funds,
but
you're
correct,
the
defendant
doesn't--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
in
mean,
in
this
case
there
are
more
substantial
contacts
between
the
respondent
and
the
western
district
of
missouri,
but
you're
correct,
under
our
theory
that's
not
an
essential
feature
of
the
grounds
for
laying
venue.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
two
best
cases
in
this
court
would
be
hyde
v.
united
states
and
in
re
palliser.
hyde
v.
united
states
involved
a
prosecution
for
conspiracy,
in
which
the
petitioners
in
this
court
were
prosecuted
in
the
district
of
columbia.
they
were
not...
for
conspiracy.
they
were
not
alleged
to
have
personally
committed
an
unlawful
act
in
the
district
of
columbia,
or
ever
to
have
been
there,
but
it
was
held
that
because
coconspirators
had
committed
overt
acts
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy
in
the
district
of
columbia,
that
that
was
an
appropriate
venue,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it...
you're
correct
that
in
some
sense
the
link
between
the
defendant
and
the
coconspirators
may
be
more
direct
than
the
link
between
the
money-launderer
and
the
persons
who
perpetrate
the
predicate
crimes.
nevertheless,
to
us
the
crucial
point
is
that
the
evil
of
money-laundering
is
not
that
the
transactions
are
per
se
unlawful
or
harmful.
the
evil
of
money-laundering
consists
precisely
of
the
fact
that
it
assists
in
the
concealment
and
thus
the
facilitation
of
the
predicate
criminal
act--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
certainly
is
our
theory
that
the
prosecution
could
be
brought
in
state
a
for
much
the
same
reasons,
that
because
the
evil
of
the
offense
is
that
it
facilitates
or
conceals
the
crime
that
occurred
in
jurisdiction
a,
and
because
the
harm
of
the
crime
is
felt
in
jurisdiction
a,
it
therefore
makes
sense
to
prosecute
the
offense
there.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
for
one
thing,
if
the
person
in
new
york
receives
it
and
profits
by
it
rather
than,
for
instance,
turning
over
the
evidence
to
the
police,
in
that
sense
it
conceals
the
offense.
it
certainly
facilitates
the
offense
in
that
the
crime
of
stealing
property
is
more
profitable
and
therefore
is
more
likely
to
occur
if
there
are
people
out
there
who
will--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
it
would
be
accurate
to
say
it
conceals
it
only
if
we
compare
the
person
who
receives
the
stolen
property
to
the
person
who
becomes
aware
of
the
theft
and
reports
it
to
the
authorities.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
the
attorney
general's
act
of
putting
the
controlled
substance
on
the
list
would
not
in
any
sense
be
conduct
that
the
ban
on
possession--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it's
no--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
would
not
be
conduct
that
it
was
the
purpose
of
the
controlled
substance
statutes
to
prohibit
or
deter,
and
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--element
of
the
offense
is
not
a
universal
justification.
i
said
in
the
opening
statement
that
typically
the
crime--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
would
dispute
the
proposition
that
all
of
the
conduct
that's
relevant
here
occurred
in
florida.
it's
true
that
the
only
conduct
in
which
the
respondent--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there's
an
intensely
practical
reason
for
that,
that
is
that
the
central
purpose
underlying
the
constitutional
requirement
that
the
crime
be
prosecuted
at
the
place
where
it
was
committed
was
to
facilitate
the
production
of
relevant
evidence,
and
it's
very
likely,
in
money
laundering
prosecutions
generally
and
in
this
case
in
particular,
that
the
fact
that
specified
unlawful
activity
generated
the
funds
will--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
it
was
designed
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think...
well,
it
was
designed
to
protect
the
defendant's
interest,
but
clearly
if
the
framers
had
been
concerned
only
with
the
defendant's
convenience,
or
with
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
be
tried
at
home,
the
constitution
would
say
that
the
defendant
has
a
right
to
be
tried
in
the
district
of
her
residence.
the
constitution
doesn't
say
that.
it
recognizes
that
the
defendant's...
the
interest
in
the
defendant's
convenience
should
not
be
so
overwhelming
as
to
frustrate--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
prin--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i'm
not
suggesting
that
they
put
the
provision
in
there
in
order
to
protect
the
prosecution.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
they...
the
constitutional
provisions
represent
a
balancing
of
the
defendant's
and
the
government's
interest.
that
is,
if
the
framers
had
wanted
to
protect
the
convenience
of
the
defendant
at
all
costs,
they
could
have
said
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
trial
in
the
district
of
her
residence.
they
could
even
have
said
the
defendant
has
the
right
to
trial
in
whatever
district
she
chooses.
as
the
court--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
in
terms
of
something
that
went
on
earlier,
i
think
there
isn't
so
much
authority.
the
principle
is
well-established
in
cases,
for
instance,
involving
aiding
and
abetting,
where
a
person
in
jurisdiction
a
assists
in
the
planning
or
preparation
for
a
crime
that's
to
occur--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it
is
true
that
respondent
is
not
being
held
responsible
for
the
drug-trafficking
crimes
in
the
sense
of
being
prosecuted
for
distribution
of
narcotics
or
for
conspiracy
to
distribute
narcotics,
but
i
think
it's
nevertheless
accurate,
in
a
sense,
to
say
that
she
is
being
held
responsible
for
those
acts.
in
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
perhaps
the
best
example
would
be
offenses
involving
the
use
of
the
mails,
or
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce,
where
congress
has
provided
by
statute
that
those
offenses
can
be
prosecuted
in
any
district,
for
instance,
where
the
mail
was
sent,
where
the
mail
was
received,
or
even
in
a
district
through
which
the
mail
passes
in
transit,
and
the
idea
is
that
even
though
the
defendant
may
not
personally
have
been
present
in
the
district
of
receipt,
nevertheless
she
is
responsible
for
harm
occurring
in
that
district
by--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think...
it...
i
think
it
is
a
good
example,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
it
shows
that
the
constitution
does
not
guarantee
the
defendant
the
right
to
trial
in
a
district
where
she
personally
acted.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
i
think
the
palliser
case
involves--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--oh,
palliser.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
okay.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
the
palliser
case
involved
the
use
of
the
mails.
the
palliser
case
also
cited
authorities
dealing
with
the
crime
of
murder,
that
established
that
the
crime
of
murder
may
typically
be
prosecuted
at
the
place
where
the
fatal
blow...
the
fatal
force
was
struck
or
the
poison
administered,
even
if
that
was
not
the
place
where
the
defendant
acted,
for
instance,
the
hypothetical
which
appears
to
have
arisen,
at
least
on
occasion,
where
a
person
standing
in
jurisdiction
a
shoots
a
gun
across
the
border
and
hits
a
person
in
jurisdiction
b.--
so
i
think
the
court
in
palliser
was
not
announcing
a
holding
that
was
unique
to
the
mail
setting.
rather,
it
was
relying
on
a
more
general
principle
that
a
person
may
be
held
accountable
for
harm
caused
in
another
jurisdiction
even
if
he
never
sets
foot
there.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
i
think
your
honor
is
correct
in
saying
that
the
defendant
in
a
money-laundering
case
doesn't
cause
the
narcotics-trafficking
activities
to
occur,
but
i
think
it's
nevertheless
the
case
that
the
harm
of
those...
the
money-laundering
activities
is
felt
in
the
district
where
the
predicate
crimes
took
place.
that
is,
the
transactions
prohibited
by
the
money-laundering
statutes
are
not
prohibited
because
they
are
per
se
harmful.
they
are
prohibited
because
they
assist
in
the
concealment
and
facilitation
of
the
underlying
crimes.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
guess
i'm
not
sure
about
the
precise
scope
of
your
hypothetical.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that
may
not
be
accurate,
because
i
think
in
the
prosecution
of
the
street
seller
it
would
not
in
any
sense
be
an
element
of
the
crime,
where...
we
would
not
typically
show--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
we
are
relying
on
effects
to
the
extent
that
they
are
elements
of
the
crime.
that
is,
here
it's
not
simply
the
case
that
the
money-laundering
did
facilitate
the
drug-trafficking
activities.
it's
the
case
that
in
order
to
obtain
a
conviction
for
money-laundering,
we
would
have
to
show
that
the
funds
were--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that
probably
would
fall
under
our
theory,
although
i
think
that's
a
harder
case,
because
the
harm
in
that
case
would
be
felt
where
the
counterfeit
bill
was
passed,
and
not
where
the
bills
were
manufactured.
again,
to
return
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--there's
harm
in
having
the
counterfeit
organization.
i
mean,
hypothetically,
if
you
had
an
individual
who,
as
a
hobby,
liked
to
counterfeit
bills
simply
for
the
artistry
of
it,
never
did
anything
with
them,
it
wouldn't
cause
any
harm.
now,
the
statutes
prohibit
that
simply
because
it
would
be
hard
to
detect
the
activity
going
on
if
you
couldn't
go
after
the
counterfeiting,
but
the
harm
that
results
from
counterfeiting
bills
occurs
at
the
moment
they're
passed
to
innocent
people,
and
to
return
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
for
a
second,
i
think
you
were
right
that
part
of
the
purpose
of
the
sixth
amendment's
guarantee
of
a
right
to
trial
in
the
place
where
the
crime
shall
have
been
committed
is
to
assure
that
a
jury
from
the
relevant
community
sits
in
judgment
upon
the
accused,
but
in
our
view,
the
relevant
community
here
is
the
western
district
of
missouri.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
you
are
right
in
your
assumption
about
the
purposes,
and
i...
we
would
respectfully
disagree
with
the
assertion
that
the
purposes
are
not
served
here.
that
is,
in
the
instant
case,
for
example,
it's
very
unlikely
to
be
a
fact
in
dispute
that
the
banking
transactions
which
are
alleged
to
have
occurred
in
florida
actually
occurred
as
stated
in
the
indictment.
it's
conceivable
that
that
will
be
disputed,
but
it's
unlikely.
what
is
most
likely
to
be
disputed
if
this
case
goes
to
trial
is,
first,
whether
the
money
was
unlawfully
generated
and,
second,
whether
the
respondent
knew
it.
now,
you're
correct
in
saying
that
it's
possible
that
we
could
prove
the
money
was
unlawfully
generated
without
proving
where
the
predicate
crimes
occurred,
but
certainly
a
very
good
way
of
proving
that
the
money
was
unlawfully
generated
would
be
to
prove
the
circumstances
underlying
the
drug-trafficking
activities,
particularly
in
a
case
where
the
government
has
already
gotten
a
conviction
for
the
drug
conspiracy
that
is
alleged
to
have
generated
the
laundered
funds.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
don't
think
it
follows
that
the
place
where
the
felony
was
committed
would
be
an
appropriate
venue.
first,
we
wouldn't
be
proving
conduct,
because
it
wouldn't
be
necessary
or
even
permissible
in
a
922
(g)
prosecution
for
us
to
present
independent
evidence
that
the
defendant
had
actually
committed
the
prior
crime.
we
would
simply
be
introducing
the
judgment
of
conviction
or
relying
upon
a
stipulation.
but
the...
as
to
the
counterfeiting,
i
think
that
the...
having
the
trial
in
the
district
where
the
counterfeiting
took
place
might
or
might
not
be
a
sensible
venue.
that
is,
if
the
government--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
might
be
because
i
assume
that
an
element
of
the
offense
of
passing
counterfeiting
money
is
that
the
person
knew
that
it
was
counterfeited
and,
at
least
in
some
cases,
one
of
the
ways
of
proving
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
money
was
counterfeit
was
to
show
that
he
was
the
one
who
manufactured
it
and
perhaps
took
it
to
distant
locations
to
pass
it,
but
that
he
was
involved
in
the
operation.
so
depending
on
the
facts
of
an
individual
case,
evidence
concerning
the
circumstances
upon...
under
which
the
money
was
manufactured
might
or
might
not
be
relevant
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
might
prosecute
him
for
that.
we
could
also
have
a
circumstance...
we
could
also
have
cases
in
which
it
was
clear
that
money
had
been
passed
from
jurisdiction
a
to
jurisdiction
b,
and
the
circumstances
under
which
the
counterfeiting
occurred
would
be
relevant
to
the
prosecution.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
wouldn't
say
the
whole
purpose,
but
i
would
say--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
would
say...
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke.
i
wouldn't
say
that
our
test
is
that
the
whole
purpose
of
the
statute
has
to
be
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
i
think
certainly
we
would
acknowledge
that
there
is
indeterminacy
at
the
margins
as
to
the
way
that
certain
cases
should
come
out.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
seems
to
me
at
the
margins.
i
think
the
other
thing
i
would
point
to
as
to
the
felon-in-possession
cases,
where
they
were
talking
about
the
location
where
the
underlying
felony
occurred,
or
the
location
where
the
gun
was
manufactured,
is
that
in
a
sense,
whether
venue
would
be
proper
at
those
sites
under
the
statute
or
the
constitution
is
a
rather
abstract
question.
that
is,
there
is
a
federal
rule
of
criminal
procedure
that
provides
for
change
of
venue
in
criminal
cases
even--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
it's
the
place
where
the
funds
were
unlawfully
generated,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
would
lose
the
case.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
we
would
lose
the
case.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
we
would
lose
it
for
improper
venue.
that
is,
even
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--oh.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
it
is
not
necessary
to
prove
the
location
in
that
sense,
but
that
really
seems
to
us
analogous
to
the
situation
involving
use
of
the
mails,
where
the
federal
statute
says
that
offenses
involving
the
use
of
the
mails
may
be
prosecuted
in
any
district
through
which
the
mailed
matter
passes.
that
doesn't
mean
that
the
government
in
a
prosecution
involving
use
of
the
mails
has
to
prove
the
identity
of
all
those
districts.
it
simply
means
that
if
we
do,
we
can
lay
venue
there
on
that
basis.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
would
say
if
the
defendant
could
show
that
that
act,
while
an
element
of
the
offense,
is
manifestly
not
the
act
that
congress
was
attempting
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
does
get
it.
i
mean--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--we
would
say
in
these
cases
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
as
a
practical
matter
another
way
of
coming
at
it
is
to
say
that
the
district
of
columbia
wouldn't
be
an
appropriate
venue
in
the
hypothetical
regarding
the
listing
of
the
drugs
because
trial
in
that
district
would
manifestly
fail
to
serve
the
purposes
underling
the
constitutional
requirements.
that
is,
it's
extraordinarily
unlikely
that
the
fact
of
the
listing
is
going
to
be
a
matter
in
dispute
at
trial,
and
the
district--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
guess
one
of
the
things
i'd
like
to
focus
on
is,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
this
is...
the
western
district
of
missouri
seems
to
us
to
be
manifestly
the
sensible
district
to
try
the
case.
we
have
a
defendant
who
was
a
resident
of
missouri.
her
lawyer
is
a
resident
of
missouri.
the
federal
prosecutor
who
is
immersed
in
the
details
of
the
case
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
the
main
difference
is
that
if
we
are
limited
to
the
conspiracy
charge
in
missouri
we
would
have
to
prove
an
agreement
in
addition
to...
an
agreement
to
launder
money
in
addition
to
the
money-laundering
offense.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
