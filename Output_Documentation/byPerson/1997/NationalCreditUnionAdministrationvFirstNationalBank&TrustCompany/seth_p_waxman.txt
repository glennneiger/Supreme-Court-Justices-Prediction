mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
enacted
the
federal
credit
union
act
to
foster
the
development
of
strong
and
stable,
cooperative
credit
institutions
so
that
persons
not
being
served
by
banks
could
obtain
credit
at
non-usurious
rates.
credit
union
proponents
advocated
including
the
common
bond
provision
because
experience
had
shown
that
credit
unions
organized
around
preexisting,
cohesive
groups
were
most
likely
to
form
economically
strong
cooperative
institutions.
the
banks
lack
standing
under
the
apa
to
challenge
the
ncua's
interpretation
of
the
common
bond
provision
because
congress
enacted
that
provision
as
an
organizing
principle
to
promote
financially
viable
credit
unions
and
not
to
impose
substantive
restrictions
or
constraints
on
competition.
thus,
the
banks'
competitive
interests
are
not
within
the,
quote,
zone
of
interests
congress
sought
to
protect.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
rehnquist,
in
clarke,
this
court
determined
that
the
plaintiffs,
the
security
industry,
had
standing
because
it
found
that
section...
sections
36
and
81
of
the
mcfadden
act,
which
were
the
substantive
provisions
at
issue
there,
had
been
enacted
to
reflect
a,
quote,
congressional
concern
to
keep
national
banks
from
obtaining
monopoly
power
over
credit
and
money
through
unlimited
branching.
and,
therefore,
congress...
the
court
found,
congress
had
arguably
legislated
against
the
very
competition
that
the
securities
interest
was
seeking
to
challenge.
in
this
case,
the
common
bond
provision,
in
particular,
and
even
the
federal
credit
union
act
in
general,
was
not
enacted
with
any
thought
to
restrict
or
control
competition
in
any
way.
it
was
enacted
in
order
to
provide
a
means
for
strengthening
the
development
of
credit
institutions.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
you
did,
justice
o'connor.
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
acknowledge
that
that
case,
at
least
in
our
view,
represents
the
outer
limits
of
where
this
court
has
gone
in
zone
of
interest.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
i...
i...
i
think...
i
think
it
is...
and
i
think
it's
important
and
can
be
readily
distinguished
in
three
ways.
first
of
all,
although
the
court
acknowledged
that
the
principle
reason
for
enacting
section
16
of
the
glass-steagall
act
had
been
to
protect
banks
from
engaging
in
investment
activities
of
their
own
sake,
the
court,
both
in
the
opinion
in
investment
company
institute,
and
subsequently
in
clarke,
also
noted
that
congress
had
been
concerned
with,
quote,
the
danger
to
the
economy
as
a
whole.
so
it
wasn't
the
only
reason.
but,
more
importantly,
the
basis
for
the
holding
in
investment
company
institute
was
that
section
16
of
the
glass-steagall
act
was
legislation
against
competition.
the
court
found
in
that
case
that
congress
had
legislated
against
the
competition
that
the
petitioners
sought
to
challenge.
so
even
if
you
construe
that
case
in
the
broadest
possible
way...
and
i
would
simply
adopt
justice
harlan's
characterization
of
the
majority
opinion
in
that
case
in
dissent...
he
said,
if
congress
prohibited
entry
into
a
field
of
business
for
reasons
relating
to
competition,
then
a
competitor
has
standing
to
seek
observance
of
the
prohibition.
now,
he
thought
that
that
was
a
holding
that
was
not
warranted
by
the
court's
prior
precedence.
but
even
if
that
is
what
investment
company
institute
v.
camp
stands
for,
that's
not
this
case.
the
common
bond
provision,
and,
indeed,
the
fcua
in
general,
have
nothing
to
do
with
competition.
they
were
not...
there
was
not
a
reason
for
enacting
the
common
bond--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
you
do,
because
prudential...
the
prudential
standing
inquiry
this
court
has
taught
is
an
analysis
of
what
congress
intended;
that
is,
the
interest...
to
quote
association
of
data
processors...
the
interest
sought
to
be
protected
by
the
complainant
must
be
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
to
be
protected
by
the
statute.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
so
you
must
determine
what
the
zone
of
interest
to
be
protected
by
the
statute
was.
and
here
it
was
clearly
an
intent
to
foster
the
development...
the
rapid
development
of
stable
and
strong
credit
unions,
because...
and
i
think
it's
also
important
to...
to
understand
this...
in
1934,
when
congress
was
considering
enactment
of
the
federal
credit
union
act,
the
country
was
beginning
to
come
out
of
the
great
depression.
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
banks...
it
was
in
the
great
depression.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
banks
had
failed
in
great
numbers.
but,
for
the
past
10
or
15
years,
there
had
been
developed
state-chartered
credit
institutions,
many...
most
characterized
by
the
existence...
or
formed
around
a
common
bond.
and
con...
the
legislative
history
is
replete
with
recognition
that
notwithstanding
the
banks'
record
during
the
great
depression,
not
a
single
state-chartered
credit
union
had
failed.
and
what
congress
wanted
to
do,
in
enacting
the
federal
credit
union
act,
was
replicate
the
success
of
the
state-chartered
institutions.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
wow.
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
ginsburg,
the
zone
of
interest
test,
which
i
believe
was
first
articulated
in
the
data
processing
case,
was
a
case
that
was
decided
with
explicit
reference
to
the
legislative
history
in
order
to
determine
congress'
purpose;
that
is,
who
congress
intended
to
benefit.
the
substantive
statute
at
issue
in
this...
in
that
case
was
section
4
of
the
national
banking
act.
and
in
analyzing
the
standing
question,
the
court
looked,
basically,
to
two
sources:
first,
the
legislative
history
and
the
extensive
comments
in
the
legislative
history
that
showed
that
section
4
was...
and
i
am
quoting
the
court
now...
a
response
to
the
fears
expressed
by
a
few
senators
that
without
such
a
prohibition,
the
bill
would
have
enabled
banks
to
engage
in
non-banking
activity,
and
thus
constitute
a
serious
exception
to
the
excepted
policy
which
strictly
limits
banks
to
banking.
now,
the
other--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i...
i
think,
jus--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
i...
i
did
not
mean
to...
to
suggest
that
a
tremendous
amount
of
weight
ought
to
be
put
on
legislative
history.
but,
nonetheless,
the
court
has,
on
occasion,
looked
at
legislative
history
to
determine
congress'
intent.
but
i
think,
justice
scalia,
in
response
to
your
point,
it's
also
very
important,
in
looking
at
the
court's
opinion
in
data
processing,
which
is
the
landmark
case
that
established
the
zone
of
interest
test,
it...
the
court
made
explicit
reference
to
two
of
its
prior
decisions
in
competitor
standing
cases:
the
acheson-topeka
railway
case
and
hardin
v.
kentucky
utilities.
and
it
characterized
its
decision
in
association
of
data
processing
as
an
extension,
or
consistent
with
those
prior
competitor
standing
cases.
and
it's
very
instructive,
i
think,
if
i
can
just
beg
the
court's
indulgence
for
a
moment,
to
recite
what
this
court
stated
in
harden
v.
kentucky
utilities
in
its
1968
opinion.
it
said:
this
court
has,
it
is
true,
repeatedly
held
that
the
economic
injury
which
results
from
lawful
competition
cannot,
in
and
of
itself,
confer
standing
on
the
injured
business
to
question
the
legality
of
any
aspect
of
its
competitor's
operations.
and
it
cited
a
line
of
cases
between
1880
and
1940.
but
competitive
injury
provided
no
basis
for
standing
in
the
above
cases
simply
because
the
statutory
and
constitutional
requirements
the
plaintiff
sought
to
enforce
were
in
no
way
concerned
with
protecting
against
competitive
injury.
in
contrast,
it
has
been
the
rule,
at
least
since
the
chicago
junction
case,
decided
in
1924,
that
where
the
particular
statutory
provision
invoked
does
reflect
a
legislative
purpose
to
protect
a
competitive
interest
the
injured
competitor
has
standing
to
require
compliance
with
that
provision.
and
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
the
precise
rationale
on
which
this
case
is
distinguished
from
investment
company
institute
v.
camp.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it...
i
don't
think
it
does.
i
don't
think
it
could
be
established,
because--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
legislative
history...
to
the
extent
the
legislative
history
reflects
anything
at
all
about
the
banks'
interest
in
this,
it
reflects
two
things.
one,
with
respect
to
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
then,
i
think
the
answer
is
that
the
banks
would
have
the
same
remedy
now
that
they
would
have
had
then,
which
is
to
go
to
congress
and
ask
for
a
legislative
adjustment.
if
the
statute
is...
in
turning
to
the
merits...
if
the
statute
is,
as
we
argue,
ambiguous...
that
is,
that
the
phrase
"groups
having
a
common
bond",
can
just
as
easily
be
interpreted
to
mean
groups,
each
having
its
own
common
bond
or
groups
all
sharing
a
single
common
bond,
the
agency's
interpretation
must
be
given
deference.
and
that,
i
sus...
i...
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
is
the
position
that
the
banks
would
be
in
had
they
believed
at
the
time
that
this
would
be
given
the
interpretation
it
was
and
objected.
that
is,
they
would
have
had
a
legislative
remedy.
congress,
for
whatever
reason--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--then,
it
seems
to
me,
the
banks
are
out
of
luck
on
standing
grounds.
that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
chevron
says,
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
an
agency's
interpretation
is
not
in
conflict
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
deference
is
due.
and
if
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
for
whatever
reason...
inadvertence
by
congress
or
a
conscious
choice
to
leave
the
decision
to
the
agency...
persists,
what
this
court
must
do
in
response
to
a
challenge
by
the
banks,
if
they
have
standing,
is
look
to
determine
whether
the
agency's
interpretation
is
a
permissible
or
reasonable
one.
and
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
at
all,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
think
the
logical
challengers
are
in
fact
the
same
kind
of
parties
that
have
been
challenging
chartering
decisions.
and
that
is
members
of
credit
unions.
the
common
bond
provision
was
enacted
to
protect
the
strength
and
stability
of
credit
unions,
and
therefore
to
protect
the
members
of
the
credit
unions.
and
in
the
cases
that
we
cited
in
our
principal
brief,
there
are
instances
in
which
members
of
credit
unions
have
sued
either
the
ncua
or
the
state
chartering
agencies,
saying,
you're
trying
to
add
disparate
groups
or
you're
trying
to
add
more
groups
than
we
think
is
safe
and
sound.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think...
i
think
a
competing
credit
union
might
have
standing
if
it
was
challenging
a
decision
that
the
agency
had
made
under
section
1754
of
the
act,
which
requires
that
the...
the
ncua
ascertain
that
economic
advisability
of
the
proposed...
of
the
proposed
chartering
or
proposed
merger,
but
not--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--here...
here's
the
reason.
because
the
agency
has
interpreted
economic
advisability,
the
statutory
term,
to
mean,
quote,
that
it
will
be
a
viable
institution,
and
its
chartering
will
not
materially
affect
the
interest
of
other
credit
unions
or
the
credit
union
system.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
any
event,
justice
souter--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
souter,
the
banks,
number
one,
have
not
challenged
the
determination
of
economic
advisability
here.
but
if
they
had--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
they
had,
i
would
argue
that
they
do
not
have
standing,
because
the
evident
purpose
of
that
statutory
provision
was
to
make
sure
that
when
the
ncua
charters
a
credit
union,
it
does
so,
taking
cognizance
of
the
interests
of
other
credit
unions
and
the
credit
union
system,
not
the
banks.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the...
the
answer
to
your
question
is
your
cases,
most
recently,
bennett
v.
spear,
do
recognize
that
congress
can
have
two
purposes.
but
in
this
case,
there
was
none.
there
was
no
purpose
reflected
in
the
legislative
history
and
the
'34
act
to
benefit--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--banks
from
competition.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
would
not
be
fair.
even
if
the
legislative
history
itself,
the
debate--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
maybe
then
it
goes
to
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
it
is
within
the
zone
of
interest
that
congress
sought
to
protect.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the...
the
accepted
purpose...
and
the...
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
court
below,
specifically
found
that
it
would
be
anomalous,
in
light
of
the
available
evidence,
to
suggest
that
this
provision
had
been
intended.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
it
would
not.
because
the
way
that
the
common
bond
provision
works
is
not
to
set
up
any
sort
of
substantive
picket
line
or
bar
or
entry
restriction.
it
is
purely
to
determine
which
individuals
in
the
united
states
get
to
belong
to
which
credit
unions.
there's
no
allegation
in
this
case
that
there
is
any
individual
member
who
belongs
to
a
credit
union
which,
if
the
banks
win,
will
not
be
able
to
belong
to
some
other
credit
union.
this
is
purely
an
internal
governing
device
for
the
industry
to
decide
who
belongs
to
which
credit
union.
may
i
reserve--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it...
it
is.
it
is
expressed
as
a
limitation,
at
the
urging
of
the
proponents
of
the
credit
union
industry
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
is
meant
to
be
confining
in
the
sense
that
the
statute
requires
something
that
the...
the
proponents
of
the
credit
union
movement
desperately
wanted,
which
is
to
maximize
success,
that
these
groups
be
organized
around...
that
credit
unions
be
organized
around
groups
having
a
common
bond.
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
justice
ginsburg,
in
response
to
your
question
about
the
states,
the
amicus
brief
submitted
by
the
parties
in
support
of
our
position
advised
us
that
36
or
37
of
the
states
permit...
state
regulators
permit
multiple
groups
within
a
single
common
bond
and
multiple
groups
with
different
bonds.
there...
of
the
five
states
that
have
the
exact
language
that
the
federal
statute
has,
either
two
or
three
have
already
interpreted
that
statute
to
permit
the
interpretation
that
the
national
credit
union
administration
has.
