mr.
waxman--
--but
isn't
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
we
go
to
the
zone
test,
which
is
you're
arguing
that...
that
the
banks
are
outside
the
zone,
i
believe
that
test
was
first
introduced
in
an
opinion
by
justice
white,
where
he
said,
it's
only
arguably
within
the
zone.
so
i
would
assume
one
need
not
consult
the
legislative
history.
one
could
see
if
a
lawyer
could
construct
a
good
argument.
and
further,
didn't
justice
white
say
that
this
was
not
a...
a
difficult
test
to
meet?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
he
was,
in
that
opinion,
expanding
standing
beyond
what
it
had
been
up
until
then.
and
he
explained
that
this
test
was
rather
easier
to
meet.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
waxman,
my...
i
just
want
to
be
clear
on
one
point.
is,
essentially,
your
standing
argument
that
there
could
be
no
challenger
to
this
in
the
court;
that,
essentially,
the
logical
challenger,
the
banks,
are
out;
so
this
would
be,
essentially,
immune
from
judicial
review,
accepting
your
view
of
standing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
who
could
challenge
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
is
a
limitation
of
some
kind,
isn't
it?
i
mean
it
is
a
limitation
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the...
the
credit
union.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it...
so
it's
meant
to
be
confining
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr....
mr.
roberts,
the
zone
test
came
up
in
a
case
where
the
court
recognized
that
there
was
standing.
and
it
was
stated
in
that
case,
and
then
it's
been
discussed
in...
in
other
cases.
it's
a
little
hard,
isn't
it,
for
you
to
extract
from
a
case
that
found
standing
all
these
results
where
there
would
be
no
standing?
because
you're
using
a
case
that
said
there
was
standing,
and
then
say,
but
we
can
find
certain
language
in
it,
instead
of
saying,
well,
the
court
dealt
with
the
zone
test,
and
it
would
elaborate
on
it
in
a
further
case.
it
seems
to
me
you're
taking
a
lot
of
negative
out
of
a
case
that
was
positive
on
standing.
justice
ruth
bader

mr.
helfer--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
helfer,
do
i
understand
correctly
that
the
language,
common
bond,
was
originally
in
state
provisions
before
there
was
a
federal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
that
line
i'd
like
to
know
whether
any
states
have
interpreted
their
legislation
using
the
same
language,
groups
having
a
common
bond,
to
mean
what
the
government
and
their
credit
unions
are
now
asserting.
have
any
states--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
attorneys
merits...
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--interpreted
that
language?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
says
that
members
of
any
federal
credit
union
shall
be
limited
to
one
or
more
groups,
each
of
which
have
within
such
group
a
common
bond.
if
that's...
if
that
were
passed--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
helfer,
aren't
there
other
limitations
that
would
prevent
this
infinite
progression?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
we
know
the
agency
considers
the
language
ambiguous,
and
we
know
that
some
members
of
congress
do,
too.
what
credit,
if
any,
should
we
give
to
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
did
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--they
did
say
this
is
a
bill
to
clarify
the
existing
law
and
ratify
the
ncua
interpretation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
why
i
thought
it
might
be
relevant
if
states
having
the
same
language
interpreted
it
the
way
the
government
is
urging
us.
