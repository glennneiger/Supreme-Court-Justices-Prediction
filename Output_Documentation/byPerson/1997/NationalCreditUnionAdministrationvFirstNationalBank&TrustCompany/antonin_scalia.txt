justice
antonin
scalia
--you
might
want
to
start
at
the
end
and
work
down.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--extensive...
such
extensive
legislative
history...
if
legislative
history
is
the
proper
source
of
this,
i
suppose
all
you
would
need
is
a
couple
of
statement
by
individual
senators,
who
could...
who
could
cause
the
statute
to
be
broader
than
it
otherwise
would.
surely
one
or
two
senators
can
render
it
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
puts
an
awful
lot
of
weight
on
legislative
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
i
don't...
what
if
i
don't
agree
with
you
that
it's
at
all
ambiguous?
and
if
i
thought
any
banker
or,
indeed,
beer
salesman,
who
read
this...
this
language
would
come
to
the
conclusion
that...
that
each
member
of
the
group
had
to
have
a
common
bond
with
the
others,
then...
then
what
would
your
response
to
justice
kennedy's
argument
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
his
argument
is
they...
they
would
have
opposed
it.
the...
the
language
seems
to
limit
these...
these
credit
unions
to
a
particular
field,
and
the
banks
surely
would
have
come
in
against
it
if
they
weren't
limited
in...
in
this
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no,
it
wouldn't
show
that
there's
no
difference.
it
would
just...
just
say
that...
it
would
just
show
that...
that
when
you
have
a
regulatory
provision,
competitive
injury
is...
is
one
thing
that
will
establish...
will
establish
both
article
i
and
prudential
standing.
but
there
are
a
lot
of
other
injuries
that...
that
wouldn't
satisfy
prudential
standing
even
though
they'd
satisfy
article
i.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
what
will
we
presume
the
congressional
intent
to
be?
these
are
hard
questions.
and
i...
i
personally
am
not
going
to
comb
through
the
legislative
history
to
find
a
statement
by
a
couple
of
senators
that
will
render
this
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest.
that
does
not
seem
to
me
an
intelligent
way
for
this
court,
or
even
a...
a
banking
lawyer,
to
try
to
figure
out
what
the
answer
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we...
we
have
some
presumptions.
and...
and...
and
congress
should
be
aware
of
those
presumptions.
surely
a
reasonable
presumption
would
be,
when
you
have
a
regulatory
statute,
any
provision
in
that
regulatory
statute
that
was
designed
to
limit
the
scope
of
activity
of
the
regulated
entity
can
be
sued
upon
by
someone
who
is...
who
is
within
the
regulated
industry
and
a
competitor.
justice
antonin
scalia
change
the
statute
a
little.
i
mean,
by
saying
"late
night",
you
make
it
obvious
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute
is
to...
is
to
hold
down
noise.
but
suppose
the
statute
is:
we
are
reducing
the
number
of
flights
into
national,
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
have
to
find
the
intent.
you
have
to
find
what
was
arguably
the
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
mean
you
have
to
identify...
you
have
to
identify
the
purpose
for
sure,
and
then
the
question
is
whether
this
is
arguably
within
that
purpose?
or
does
arguably
within
the
zone
of
interest
mean
this
was
arguably
the
purpose
and
this
is
arguably
within
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
couldn't
have
a
single
group?
you
couldn't
have
a
credit
union
composed
of
only
a
single
group?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
composed
of
groups
that
have
a
common
bond.
so
there...
there
must
be
more
than
one
group
in
every
credit
union
under
your
reading?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
it's
a
plausible
reading,
but
it's
your
reading.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
shall
be
limited
to
groups
having
a
common
bond.
so
it
seems
to
me
you
can't
have
a
single
group,
because
that
would
not
be
a
group
having
a
common
bond
with
other
groups.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
plural
includes
the
singular?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
i
assume
there
are
two
clients
of
banks,
aren't
there,
the
people
who
put
money
in
and
people
who
take
money
out?
i
mean,
those
who
make
deposits,
and
those
who
make
loans.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
even
if
it
were
true
that
banks
were
not
competing
with
credit
unions
for
loans,
they
might
still...
it
would
seem
would
still
be
competing
with
them
for
depositors,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
bank
rates
regulated,
the
interest
that
a
bank
could
pay
on
a
deposit?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
that
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
senator
kean
still
alive?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
senator
kean
still
alive
when
the
act
we're
looking
at
was
enacted?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
really
know,
do
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
arguably,
you
say.
i
recognize
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
who
said
that?
do
we
know
who
said
that,
that
particular
quote?
was
that
senator
what's-his-name,
too?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you
said
dementia.
you
said
this
case
is
a
lot
like
dementia.
[laughter]
that's
arguable,
too,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
under
the
agency's
interpretation,
if
there
is
only
one
group
in
a
credit
union,
the
people
in
that
group
don't
have
to
have
any
common
bond
at
all.
it's
only
groups
that
have
to
have
a
common
bond,
right?
so
if
you
had--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
at&t
and
other
companies,
all
those
other
companies
have
to
have
a
common
bond.
justice
antonin
scalia
either
that,
or
you
can
only
have
groups,
and
you
can't
have
one
company.
