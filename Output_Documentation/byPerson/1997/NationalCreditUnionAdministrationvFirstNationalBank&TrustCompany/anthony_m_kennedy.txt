suppose
that--
--well,
do
you...
do
you
agree--
--suppose
that
we
could
establish
by
the
legislative
history
that
we
would
accept
this
dispositive,
or
by
judicial
notice,
that
if
the
agency's
interpretation
of
the
statute
had
been
intended
by
the
legislature
or
put
into
the
statute
in
explicit
terms,
that
the
banks
would
have
actively
opposed
it
on
the
grounds
of
it
being
a
compet...
a
competitive
injury,
does
that...
would
that
change
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
quite
a
plausible
in...
inference.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
assuming
that
it
does
establish
the
proposition
that...
that
i
put
forward,
that
the
banks
would
have
been
very
active
in
opposition
to
this
bill
had
this
interpretation
been
written
explicitly
into
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i...
i
don't
know
that
it's
beside
the
point,
because
the
way
you're
arguing,
it's
something
of...
of
a
trap.
let's
assume
that
the
most
plausible
interpretation
of
this
regulation
is...
is
the
interpretation
that
the
banks
now
advance.
if
they
were
satisfied
that
that's
what
the
statute
meant,
you
know
the
bankers'
lobbyists...
i
assume
the
bankers
had
lobbyists
in
19...
in
the
1930's?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
sure
they
did.
and...
and...
and
if--
[laughter]
and...
and
they
would
have
been
all
over
this
statute--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
all
over
the
hill
had
it...
had
it
been
given
the
plausible
interpretation
that
you're
now
arguing
for.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
a
member
of
a
credit
union
would
have
standing
to
establish...
to...
to
attack
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--then...
then
it
seems
to
me
we're
really
enforcing
something
of...
of
a
fiction
on
our
standing
doctrine;
that
the
most
interested
challenger
in
this
interpretation,
the
most
injured
person
or
entity
is
the
bank.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
so
we're
having
a
credit
union
member
front
for
the
banks'
interest.
that
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i...
we're
talking
about
federal
law
here,
but
there
is
some
law
in
the
states
on
the
position.
there
are
a
number
of
states
that
have
provisions
regulating
medical
practice,
that
dentists
and
optometrists
cannot
use
certain
procedures
or
administer
certain
drugs.
i
take
it
under
your
theory
that,
if
those
were
changed
to
expand
the
functions
and
the
privileges
of
an
optometrist
or
a
dentist,
that
any
doctor
could
sue.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
law
in
the
states
generally?
