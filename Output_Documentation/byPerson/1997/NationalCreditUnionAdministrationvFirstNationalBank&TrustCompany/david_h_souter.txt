justice
david
h.
souter
why
doesn't
that
open
it
to...
why
doesn't
that
open
it
to
banks?
justice
david
h.
souter
that...
economic
advisability
sounds
to
me
something
like
a
competitive
possibility.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
that's...
that's
a
two-part
standard.
and
it
seems
to
me
the
first
part
is...
is
equally
open
to
the
banks
to
raise.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it?
i
don't
know
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--viability
is
a
wonderful
word,
but
it...
and
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means,
but
it
says
something
about
economic
feasibility.
and
that's
a
product
of
competition.
and
that
implicates
banks
in
general,
doesn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
what
about
the
answer
to
my
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
certainly
is
included.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
argument...
and
i...
and
i
thought
in
the
argument
you
were...
you
were
making
earlier,
you
are
making
the
assumption
that
there
can
only
be
one
purpose,
or
that
there
is
at
least
a
predominant
purpose,
and
that
controls.
and
is...
is
there
authority
in
our
cases
for
that?
in
other
words,
why...
why,
for
example,
in
this
case,
could
it
not
have
been
both
the
purpose
of
congress
to...
to
assure
the...
the...
the
kind
of
community
soundness
of
these
credit
unions
and
to
protect
regular
banks
from
their
competition?
why
can't
it
be
both?
and
if
it's
both,
why
isn't
there
standing
to
the
bank?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that
isn't
the
only--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
let
me
ask
you
this.
let's
assume
we
had
a
case
in
which
the
legislative
history
was
totally
silent.
would
we
not...
and...
and
let's
assume
that
were
the
case
here...
i
realize
that's
not
your
position...
wouldn't
it
be
fair
in
that
case
for
us
to
infer
that
the
purpose
of
this
limitation,
or
at
least
one
purpose
of
this
limitation,
was
in
fact
the
protection
of
neighboring
banks
from
competition.
would
that
be
legitimate?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
then,
how
would
we
ever
decide
the
standing
question?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
and
why
wouldn't
the
plaintiff
have
a
perfectly
sound
argument
to
say,
look,
this
seems,
among
other
things,
to
protect
us
from
competition.
why,
therefore,
may
we
not
infer
a...
a
purpose
for
standing
doctrine?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i'm...
no...
you're
changing
the
question,
i
think,
with
respect.
i'm
saying
let's
assume
the...
the
record
is
silent.
we
don't
have
any
legislative
history.
all
we
have
is
what's
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
would
it
not
be
a
legitimate
inference
that
the
protection
of
banks
against
competition
was
at
least
a
purpose
of
this
limitation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
in
that
context,
are
you
going
to
address
mr.
roberts'
point
that
not
merely
as
legislative
history
but
as
a
matter
of
real
history,
there
simply
was
no
competition
at
that
time
as
between
banks
and
credit
unions
for
the
kind
of
business
that
the
credit
unions
served?
justice
david
h.
souter
were
they
alternatives
for
deposits,
or
alternatives
for
loans,
or
both?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
loans
to
the
small
borrower.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
it
had
the
groups
language
in
it?
