mr.
michael
s.
helfer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
expressly
limited
membership
in
federal
credit
unions
in
the
except
clause,
and
the
whole
clause
is
critical.
it
reads,
except
that
federal
credit
union
membership
shall
be
limited
to
groups
having
a
common
bond
of
occupation
or
association,
and
it
then
goes
on,
or
to
groups
within
a
well-defined
neighborhood
community
or
rural
district.
we
submit
that
the
first
thing
you
do
in
making
the
standing
determination
under
the
cases
is
look
at
the
text
and
what
it
does.
what
does
the
common
bond
requirement
do?
it
limits
the
persons
to
whom
a
credit
union
can
offer
its
banking
services.
that's
what
it
does.
that's
the
effect
of
it.
the
first
thing
you
look
at
is
the
text.
it's
just
like
the
clarke
case.
in
clarke,
the
mcfadden
act
limitations
limited
the
locations
at
which
a
bank
could
market
its
services
to
other
people.
it
has
the
same
effect.
so
the
presumption...
to
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
the
presumption,
then,
ought
to
be
that
a
limitation
of
that
kind
that
has
that
effect
is
intended
as
a
competitive
limitation,
particularly
in
the
context
in
which
the
legislation
was
passed.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
yes.
i'll
be
happy
to
answer
that,
to
respond
to
that
point.
in
the
first
place,
the
banks
did
testify
at
the
hearings
on
the
d.c.
credit
union
act,
which
was
the
precursor
to
the
federal
credit
union
act,
and
which
mr.
berengren,
who
was
the...
bergengren,
pardon
me,
who
was
the
chief
credit
union
advocate,
has
described
as
a
copy...
that
the
federal
act
is
a
copy
of
the
d.c.
act.
the
banks
testified,
and
they
testified
about
their
competitive
concerns
with
the
act.
congress
made
a
change
relating
to
demand
deposits,
and
congress
then
carried
forward
that
change
into
the
federal
credit
union
act.
with
respect
to
the
precise
question
of
the...
were
the
banks
providing
these
services,
banks
were
viewed...
the
ncua
brief
at
5,
and
again
at
21,
tells
us
that
banks
were
viewed
as
an
alternative
to
credit
unions
when
the
fcua
was
passed.
congress
wanted--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--they
would
be
alternatives,
i
believe,
for
both.
not
all...
banks
were
not
failing
to
make
any
loans
at
all.
what
congress
wanted
in
the
credit
union--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i'm
sorry.
i
meant
loans
to...
we're
talking
about
consumer
loans,
yes--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--justice
souter.
when
congress...
what
congress
wanted
was
more
sources
of
credit.
when
you
read
what
they
were
talking
about,
they
wanted
more
sources
of
credit.
the
banks
weren't
doing
enough.
the
loan
sharks
were
paying...
were
charging
very
high
prices.
the
banks,
of
course,
had
been
through
a
very
difficult
time
and
were
asking
for
a
lot
of
security
and
other
things.
congress
had
just
passed...
to
go
to
the
historical
context--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--yes.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
well,
that's
a
very
fair
point.
i'm
sorry,
i
was
focusing
on
loans
coming
out
of
justice
souter's
question.
the
focus
in
the
legislative
history
was
on
getting
money
back
in
to
get
the
economy
rolling
again.
congress
of
course
didn't
want
to
take
away
the
source
of
deposits
in
banks,
which
were
making
commercial
loans
as
well
as
some
consumer
loans,
but
making
commercial
loans.
it
wanted
to
get
the
economy
going
again.
that's
why
it
passed
the
glass-steagall
act
and
the
federal
deposit
insurance.
in
june
1933...
to
put
it
in
its
historical
concept,
in
june
1933
congress
passed
the
banking
act
of
1933,
which
included
glass-steagall
and
federal
deposit
insurance,
and
it
was
during
that
month
that
the
hearings
were
held
on
the
federal
credit
union
act,
and
there
was
an
inquiry,
not
surprisingly,
about
what
the
position
of
the
banks
was
with
respect
to
the
bill,
and
mr.
berengren,
having
laid
the
groundwork,
said
the
banks
weren't
opposed.
it's
clear
that
the
banks
were
in
the
picture,
and
the
concerns
of
the
banks
were
in
the
picture.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
i
don't
believe
their--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--at
that
time,
i
don't
believe
so.
reg
q
came
into
effect
later
on.
they
were
not
interest
rates
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
they
were
straight
limitations,
i
believe,
at
that
time.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
no,
i'm
sorry,
there
certainly
was
state
regulation
on
the
usury
side,
on
the
lending
side.
i'm
not
familiar,
your
honor,
although
i
haven't
looked
carefully
at
whether
there
was
state
regulation
that
might
have
been
applicable
on
the
deposit
side.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
i
believe
that
under
this
court's
decisions
the
question
is
the
zone
of
interest.
what
the
d.c.
circuit--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--well,
i
do
in
this
sense,
justice
o'connor.
what
the
d.c.
circuit
does
is,
in
trying
to
implement
zone
of
interest,
carry
out
this
court's
decisions,
it's
divided
its
thinking,
its
verbal
formulation,
into
intended
beneficiary
and
suitable
challenger,
but
both
are
ways
of
determining
whether
or
not
the
zone
of
interest
test
is
met,
and
the
zone
of
interest
test--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--well--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--well,
that
formulation
is
one
which
i
think
this
court
doesn't
have
to
reach.
this
court's
formulation
has
always
been
zone
of
interest.
judge
wald,
in
concurring
in
the
decision
below,
actually
criticized
the
suitable
challenger
test
as
implemented
by
the
majority
in
this
case
and
others
as
too
narrow,
as
not
fully
carrying
out
the
zone
of
interest
test,
and
so
we...
but
we
think
that
test
is
the
zone
of
interest
test,
and
that's
what
clarke
and
camp
and
the
other
cases
show.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
well,
i
think
if
that
were
part
of
this
test,
that
sounds
very
much
to
me
like
the
mcfadden
act
limitations
on
where
a
bank
can
put
an
office
that
were
at
issue
in
the
clarke
case,
justice
stevens,
and
so
i
think
on
that
basis
i
would
conclude
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
i
think
so,
because
that
sounds
to
me
just
like
mcfadden.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
well--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i
think
there,
when
you
look
at
that
kind
of
a
statute,
you
would
conclude,
i
think,
that
it
isn't
a
competitive
boundary.
it
isn't
a
competitive
limit.
now,
a
bank
might
come
in
and
say,
well,
if
they
say
they
pay
their--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--it
might
do
that.
you'd
have
to
make
that
assessment.
the
question
would
be,
of
course,
whether
there'd
be
article
iii
standing
in
the
first
place
where
you
could
show
a
direct--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--well--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i
think
that
is
harder
than
a
clear
competitive
boundary
like
this
one
on
who
you
can
serve,
and
in
that
one
i--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--that's
right.
but
what
if--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--what
affects
the
bank's
competitive
interest
is,
as
shown--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--is
the...
is
taking
away
customers,
and--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--well,
i
think
you
have
to...
when
you
look--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i
think
that
the...
at
some
point
the
relationship
between
the
nature
of
the
limitation
and
the--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--and
in
response
to
that
i
would
say
that
clarke
is
a
case...
camp
is
a
case
on
who
may
do
business,
what
business
you
can
do.
that's
a
glass-steagall
case.
but
clarke
is
a
case
on
where
you
can
do
business.
it's
not
an
activities
case.
it's
not
a
glass-steagall
case,
it's
a
mcfadden
act
case,
which
is
why
i
answered
your...
the
first--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--where
to--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--well,
i
think
that
if
the
limitation
affected
the
competitive
authority
of
a
regulated
entity
in--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--well,
if
number
always
affects
competition
and...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
principle
is
that
in
a
regulated
marketplace
limitations
on
your
competitor
are
limitations
that
it's
sensible
to
believe
that
congress
would
permit
the
other
competitors
to
meet,
and
if
that's
that
kind
of
limitation,
then
i
would
agree
that
they
would
have
standing.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
well,
there's--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i
think
it
is
true
that
the
first
thing
you
look
at
is
the
text,
and
what
it
does,
and
if
it
has
the
effect
of
limiting
one
competitor
in
a
regulated
marketplace,
which
is
what
this
is,
that
cases
like
data
processing,
which
involved
data
processors,
arnold
tours,
which
is
about
travel
agents
coming
in,
even
though
the
court
said
there
was
no
indication
at
all
that
the
court
was
concerned
about
data...
about
travel
agents,
would
permit
standing
under
those
circumstances,
what--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i'm
sorry.
just
to
finish
up
on
that,
what
we're
doing
here,
what's
involved
here
on
the
standing
side,
the
cause
of
action
comes
from
section
10
of
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
question
is
carrying
out
congress'
intent
in
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
court
has
interpreted
congress'
intent
as
being
to
facilitate
judicial
review.
it
makes
it
presumptively
reviewable.
it's
not
an
especially
demanding
test.
these
are
all
the
terms
in
clarke
in
carrying
out
congress'
intent
in
section
10.
then
you
only
deny
standing
in
carrying
out
section
10,
congressional
intent,
when
the
interests
are
simply
not
implicated
by
or
are
inconsistent
with
the
statue.
that
was
air
courier,
the
postal
employees
in
air
courier.
they're
just
separate
from
the
interests
of
the
statute,
but
it
is
congressional
intent
in
section
10
which
is
critical,
and
when
you
combine
that
with
the
clear
congressional
intent
to
limit
credit
unions,
who
they
can
serve--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--it
certainly
is
true--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--if
they'd
made
such
a
finding
at
some
point
you're
going
to
get
close
to
a
case
like
block
v.
community
nutrition.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
okay.
i'm
sorry.
i'm
just
using
that
to
discern
the
principle
that
would
be
applicable.
when
congress
manifests
an
intention
that
a
particular
group...
it
was...
in
block
it
was
the
milk
consumers...
not
be
allowed
to
get
judicial
review,
either
by
what
it
says
in
the
statute
or
by
the
way
it
structures
the
statute,
then
you
don't
have
standing
under
section
10.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
in
that
hypothetical,
i
think
if
congress
clearly
said
in
the
statute
this
is
the
sole
and
only
purpose
of
it,
then
that
would
be
a
manifestation
of
congressional
intent
that
other
people
not
sue,
but
legislation--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--there
would
be
no
standing,
i'm
sorry,
yes,
but...
i'm
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to...
i
didn't
want
to
duck
it,
but
yes.
yes,
there
would
be
no
standing.
but
legislation
is
almost
never
passed
for
one
purpose.
they
always
have
multiple
purposes.
you
know,
here,
to
come
back
to
a
point
on
the
legislative
history
of
the
act,
a
ponit
was
made
by
my
colleagues
that
the
banks
didn't
say
anything
about
the
common
bond
provision.
well,
they
didn't
say
anything
about
the
common
bond
provision
because
it
was
in
the
bill
from
the
beginning.
it
was...
the
very
point
that
they
made,
that
the
trade
union
advocates
had
put
it
in,
the
banks
didn't
have
to
ask
for
a
common
bond
provision.
the...
there
is
an
indication
in
one
of
the
ncua
studies
that's
cited
in
the
brief
that
suggests
that
one
hypothesis
was
that
the
common
bond
was
designed
by
mr.
filene,
who
was
a
credit
union
advocate,
and
others
to
assure
that
the
banks
would
not
object
to
the
bill.
that's
at
page
4
of
the
ncua
study
in
federal
credit
union
member--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--charter--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--yes,
it
was
in
state
provisions,
and
in
a
model
provision
as
well.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
none
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
if
that
legislation
passed,
parts
of
this
legislation
might
be
moot.
it
would
depend,
because
it
would
not...
i
guess
there
is
actually
some
legislation
which
might
moot
the
whole
case,
because
it
would
eliminate
the
common
bond
requirement
completely,
and
if
that
happened--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--if
that
legislation
were
passed,
it
would
eliminate...
yes,
it
would
eliminate
our
argument
that
the
statute
now
requires
one
common
bond
for
all
of
the
members.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
certainly.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
well,
and
i
think
that
justice--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--yes,
justice
breyer,
with...
although
it
is
not
necessary
to
show
under
the
cases
that
there
was
a
spec...
an
intent
to
benefit
the
particular--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
yes.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
yes,
essentially--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i
don't
think
that
you
need
to
have
any
presumptions
here.
i
think
if
you
use
the
traditional
tools
of
statutory--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--justice
breyer,
the
reasons
that
we
have
standing
are
that
the
statute...
the
effect
of
the
statute,
what
the
statute
does
is
to
limit
who
the
credit
unions
can
sell
their
banking
services
to.
that's
the
first
thing
you
look
at.
the
second
thing
you
look
at
when
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
is
that,
with
all
respect,
you
do
find
that
the
banks
were
involved,
and
that
they
were
concerned,
and
that
they
were
there,
and
that--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--that
is
in--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--that
is
in...
you
have
to
start
with
the
legislative
history
of
the
d.c.
credit
union
legislation,
which
was
passed
in
1932,
okay.
at
the
hearings
on
that
act,
senator
kean
said,
i
agree
with
the
president
that
we
ought
to
go
very
slowly
with
anything
that
will
interfere
with
banks
at
the
present
time.
that's
in
the
1932
hearings
at
page
31.
at
those
same--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--justice
o'connor
this
law,
and
my
colleagues
agree,
is
the
precursor
to
the
federal
credit
union
act,
and
mr.
bergengren,
who
was
the
sole
witness
on
the
federal
act,
referred
to
the
d.c.
act
as
a
copy.
that's
at
1933
hearings
at
page
29.
so
this
is
not
some
separate
and
different
law
that
we're
looking
at.
it
is
the
exact
precursor
that
congress
passed
before
it
passed
the
federal
credit
union
act--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--yes,
it
did.
it
had
exactly
the
same
groups
language--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--the
same
common
bond
limitation,
exactly.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
i'm
sorry,
justice--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia,
i
don't--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i
don't
know.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
well,
you
also
have
the
bankers
testifying
in...
on...
in
the
proceedings
on
the
'32
act
about
their
competitive
concerns,
particularly
with
respect
to
deposit-taking
by
the
credit
unions,
and
you
have
that,
congress
changing
the
act
in
that
respect
to
accommodate
the
bankers'
concerns,
and
you
have
that
change
carried
forward
to
the
federal
credit
union
act
as
well.
you
do
not
have
the
banks
complaining
about
the
common
bond
provision,
because
the
common
bond
provision,
the
common
bond
restriction
was
in
the
act
already.
there
just
wasn't
any
need
to
say
anything
about
it
or
to
ask
for
it.
now,
not
in
the
legislative
history
but
in
the
record
here
let
me
point
out
something
else.
mr.
filene
wrote
an
article
in
the
american
bankers
association
journal
in
1925.
it's
in
the
lodged
materials,
lodged
by
the
government,
at
tab
2,
at
page
24,
in
which...
he
wrote
it
in
the
bankers
association
journal
to
reassure
the
banks
that
the
credit
union
system
wouldn't
be
a
competitor
because...
and
this
is
a
quote
now...
"credit
unions
are
organized
within
specific
groups.
"
and
have
to
meet
the
common
bond
requirement.
so
i
think
the
fair
reading
of
the
overall
history...
and
i
emphasize,
justice
breyer,
that
filene
article
is
not
in
the
legislative
history
technically,
but
it
is
in
the
materials
before
the
court.
the
overall
reading
is
that
the
credit
union
advocates
wanted
the
common
bond
for
their
own
purposes,
recognized
that
it
would
help
to
make
sure
that
the
banks
didn't
oppose
the
bill,
at
a
time
in
which...
the
congressional
goal
was
not
to
injure
or
hurt
the
banks.
the
goal
was
to
restore
the
banking
system
to
health,
which
is
why
they
passed
the
banking
act
of
1933.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
at
least
arguably,
yes.
[laughter]
i
find
it
persuasive,
but
i...
but
at
least
arguably.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
any
doctor
who
was
injured
by
that.
i
think
the
same
principles
that
have
been
used
in
the
standing
cases
would
lead
to
that
result.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy,
i
simply
can't
answer
that
question
over--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--and
are
permitted,
yes,
chief
justice.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
if
i
may
turn
to
the
merits...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
that's...
that
is
correct.
the
statute
was...
'32
and
then
'34.
that's
absolutely
correct.
on
the
merits,
we
think
that
congress...
that
the
question
here...
the
chevron
question
is
not
what
general
waxman,
as
general
waxman
described,
about
unambiguous
language
used
by
congress.
the
question
is,
is
the
congressional
intent
clear,
and
you
determine
congressional
intent
largely
by
looking
at
the
language,
to
be
sure,
but
by
using
all
of
the
tools
of
statutory
construction.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
we...
i
submit--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--that's
right,
and
i
submit
that
the...
and
the
courts,
both
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit,
held
that
the
legislative
intent,
as
expressed
in
this
language,
was
not
ambiguous,
shown
in
two
ways
that
i
will
summarize
here.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
well,
the--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--the...
we
submit
that
the
language
is
not.
chevron
says
that
the
intention,
congressional
intention
is
the
law
and
must
be
given
effect,
but
the
language
is
not
ambiguous
in
terms
of
what
the
statute
intended
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
the
except
clause,
the
whole
clause
that
we've
been
talking
about,
is
an
exception
that
both
limits
credit
union
membership
and
limits
the
ncua's
otherwise
broad
authority
at
the
beginning
of
the
statute.
they
get
very
broad
authority
to
determine
who
can
be
the
member
of
any
credit
union.
then
they
go
on
and...
congress
goes
on
and
says,
except
that
credit
union
membership
shall
be
limited
to
groups
having
a
common
bond.
if...
the
limit
has
to
be,
we
submit,
and
as
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
d.c.
circuit
held,
has
to
be
one
common
bond
per
credit
union,
because
if
it
isn't,
if
a
credit
union
can
join
together
an
infinite
number
of
distinct
groups,
then
the
credit
union,
or
then
the
common
bond
limitation
would
not
have
its
intended
limiting
effect.
mr.
roberts
conceded
that
point.
he
said--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--there
are
at
the...
there
are
other
limitations
that
the
agency
has
imposed
in
its
discretion,
like
not
letting
credit
unions
compete
with
one
another.
those
are
not
statutory.
but
the
key
point,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that,
as
mr.
roberts
admitted,
the
way
they
read
the
statute,
the
common
bond
limitation
has
no
effect.
it
allows
everybody
who
is
employed
to
join
at&t
credit.
this
clause,
the
except
that
credit
union
membership
shall
be
limited
to
groups
having
a
common
bond,
has
no
limiting
effect,
and
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
said.
there's
no
reason
to
have
that
clause
if
you
read
it
the
way
the
ncua
reads
it
right
now.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
well,
the
agency
and
its
predecessors
interpreted
the
common
bond
clause
to
require
one
common
bond
per
credit
union
from
the
time
of
enactment
until
1982,
nearly
50
years,
and
from
the
time
of
enactment
and
for
that
long
is
strong
evidence
about
what
the
clarity
of
the
original
intention
was.
it's
a
chevron
i
relevant
point.
with
all
respect,
congress
is
in
the
business
of
determining
what
the
law
is
going
to
be,
this
congress
is,
and
its
views
about
whether
the
law
ought
to
change
are
views
that
are
entitled
to
respect
going
forward,
but
not
about
what
this
law
means.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
this
case
is
like--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--well,
i
think
i
can
say
with
all
respect
the
credit
unions
have
lobbyists,
too,
and
the--
[laughter]
and
that
we
ought
to
look
at
what
the...
at
what
this
text
says.
in
this
respect--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--if
he
was
still
alive,
i'm
sure
he
would
have.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
yes,
absolutely,
and
the
government
doesn't
cite
any
such
interpretations,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
your
honor.
this
case
is
a
lot
like
dimension,
the
dimension
case,
where
the
fed
came
in
and
wanted?
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
i'm
sorry,
chief
justice,
the
dimension
case,
dimension
v.
board
of
governors.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
perhaps
i
ought
to
skip
dimension
and
go
on
to
parallel
clauses.
[laughter]
the...
in
dimension,
in
any
event,
the
agency
came
in
and
said,
we
need
to
construe
the
definition
of
bank
in
the
bank
holding
company
act
so
as
to
reach
institutions
that
are
so-called
nonbank
banks,
and
that
there
were
strong
public
policy
reasons
to
do
it.
the
agency
here
says
there's
strong
public
policy
reasons
to
have
a
multiple
unlimited
common
bond
requirement
provision,
and
that's
properly
addressed
to
congress,
as
in
dimension,
where
congress,
after
this
court's
decision,
made
the
change.
going
back
to
the
parallel
clauses
for
one
moment,
the
community
credit
union
clause,
the
agency
agrees,
does
require
every
community
credit
union
to
have
a
single
common
bond
of
community,
but
it
says
the
preceding
and
parallel
clause
in
the
statute
permits
this
unlimited
number
of
members,
and
we
submit,
with
all
respect,
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
both
clauses
are
doing
the
same
work
in
the
statute.
both
clauses
are
limiting
the
groups
that
can
join
any
one
credit
union.
the
difference,
we're
told,
is
the
difference
between
within,
which
is
a
restrictive
prepositional
phrase,
and
having,
which
is,
we
are
told,
an
explanatory
participle
phrase.
that
just
isn't
reading
the
statute.
that's
an
overemphasis
on
the
grammatical...
on
the
king's
english,
not
what
congress
intended.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
i
think
that's
the--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--i
think
that's
a
logical
conclusion,
justice
scalia,
but
they
do--
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
--that's
right,
but
they
do
in
fact
permit
one
company,
one
group
there.
they
do
permit
those
kinds
of
credit
unions,
in
any
event.
that's
not
at
all...
let
me
just
finish
up
by
saying
what
<atandt>
[=
at&t]
is.
at&t
here,
so
you
can
get
a
sense
of
what
it
is,
is
a
$500
million
tax-exempt
conglomerate,
and
it
has
more
than
300
distinct
employee
and
associational
groups
in
it.
that
means
it
has
more
than
300
separate
common
bonds
inside
it.
its
range
is
truly
enormous.
it
has
picked
up
employee
groups
that
are
as
small
as
eight
workers,
so
it
is
capable
of
going
around
the
country
and
drawing
in
virtually
everybody
who
is.
mr.
michael
s.
helfer
it
compares
in
size
as
follows,
your
honor.
randolph
state
bank,
of
asheville,
north
carolina,
is
one-third
the
size
of
at&t
credit.
thank
you
very
much.
