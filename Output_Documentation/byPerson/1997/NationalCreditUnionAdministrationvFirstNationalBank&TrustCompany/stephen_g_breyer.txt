justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
you
could
have...
you
could
have
one
credit
union
to
which
every
person
in
the
united
states
belongs,
who
is
employed,
but
for
sole
proprietorships?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
then,
i
mean,
this
wasn't
much
of
a
limitation
of
anything,
if
that's
so,
isn't
it?
i
mean
you
could
have...
you
could
have
200
million
people
in
one
single
credit
union.
i
don't
know
why
congress
bothered
with
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
mean
everyone
except
for
sole
proprietors,
who
is
employed,
works
with
at
least
one
other
person.
and,
therefore,
those
two
people...
two
people
anywhere
in
the
united
states,
could
join
a
credit
union.
i
mean,
is
that
a
plausible
interpretation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm...
go
ahead,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can--
--but
do
i
also
understand
that
if
the
legislation
that's
now
pending,
the
proposed
legislation
with
respect
to
defining
precisely
groups
having
a
common
bond,
if
that
legislation
passed,
this
case
would
be
moot?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'd
like
to
ask
you
a
couple
of
questions.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
assume
that
the
basic
standing
question...
this
is
the
assumption...
is
whether
you,
your
clients,
the
plaintiffs,
suffer
the
kind
of
injury
that
congress
or
that
this
statute
intended
to
protect
these
kind
of
people
against.
that's
basically
the
question
of
standing,
isn't
it?
are
they...
and
then
you
have
to
add
the
word,
arguably,
and
once
you
add
the
word
arguably,
it
becomes
a
problem.
i
don't
know
if
you
have,
but
i
never,
in
17
years
of
being
a
judge,
have
found
a
position
that
a
lawyer
couldn't
plausibly
argue
for.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right?
i'm
just
asking...
that's
the
assumption
on
which
my
question...
i
take
it
you
basically
agree
with
that
assumption.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
saying
we
have
to
interpret
a
statute,
the
object...
the
question
is,
is,
are
the
plaintiffs
suffering
the
kind
of
injury
that
this
statute
seeks
to
protect
these
kind
of
people
against,
or
compensate
them
for,
or
prevent
in
the
future?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--or
prevent
them
from
suffering?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that's
the
question,
all
right,
and
the
answer
is,
how
do
we
decide
if
it's
arguably
so.
now,
what
i
don't
understand,
and
this
is
my
question,
and
i
got
this
very
much
from
justice
stevens,
i
think,
what
he
was
trying
to
do,
is
say,
why
do
we
answer
this
question
through
the
use
of
presumptions?
it's
going
to
be
pretty
tough.
we'll
make
up
a
presumption,
and
then
in
the
400,000
pages
of
statutes
and
regulations
we're
going
to
find
some
cases
where
a
presumption
doesn't
work,
it
mixes
up
the
lawyers,
they
forget
it...
why
don't
we
just
answer
that
question
exactly
like
we
answer
any
other
statutory
question
and
if,
in
fact,
we
use
legislative
history,
fine,
and
if
in
fact
we
don't,
fine,
but
it's
a
typical
statutory
question
that
should
be
answered
without
the
use
of
presumptions
that
will
be
good
for
this
ticket
and
day
only.
that's
basically
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
then
if
you
do
not
want
us
to
use
presumptions
and
think
we
don't
have
to,
my
next
question
would
be,
right
here
we
have
some
language
that
restricts
this
to
groups.
from
looking
at
the
language
i
have
no
reason
at
all
to
think
this
was
done
to
protect
banks
at
a
time
in
history
when,
in
fact,
people
were
passing
this
kind
of
statute
to
protect
depositors,
lenders,
and
get
out
of
the
depression.
they
wanted...
all
right.
now,
so
the
language
doesn't
help
me.
i
personally
sometimes
find
legislative
history
useful,
and
when
i
go
to
that
legislative
history
i
do
not
find
one
word
that
suggests
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
help
competing
banks,
and
therefore
whether
i
use
legislative
history
or
whether
i
don't
use
legislative
history,
without
any
presumption
coming
in,
which
i
don't
know
what
it
would
do
elsewhere,
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
how
your
clients
have
standing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
good.
so
where
is
that?
now,
will
you
tell
me
that
were
in
the
legislative
history--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
would
be
helpful.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
you
to
stop
before
you've
said...
i
have
page
31
of
the
'32
act.
is
there
anything
else?
