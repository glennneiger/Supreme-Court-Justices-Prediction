justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would...
if...
there
would
be
standing
for
the
banks
if
the
provision,
instead
of
the
one
we
had
before
us,
said
that
the
credit
union
has
to
have
its
offices
in
the
same
building
that
the
employer
has
its
offices,
and
then
they
want
to
open
an
office
next
door.
could
the
bank
say,
hey,
you're
getting
too
big?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
there
would
be
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
provision
limited
the
people
who
could
serve
on
the
board
of
directors
of
the
credit
union--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
you
have
to
have
two
appointed
by
management
and
two
employees
and
a
third
party,
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
might
limit
the
number
of
associations
that
could
do
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you'd
have
a
proliferation
of
credit
unions
that
didn't
qualify
on
the
director
standing.
they're
just
all
over
the
country
taking
a
lot
of
loans
that
the
banks
would
otherwise
get.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
could
demonstrate
that
factually,
that
they
just...
for
some
reason
it's
a
lot
easier
to
organize
them
quickly
if
they
don't
have
to
go
through
the
red
tape
of
appointing
all
these
directors.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
who
can
serve,
not
only
who
you
can
serve.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
identify
what
unit
can
serve,
which
is
also
what
happens
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
proliferation
of
credit
unions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wouldn't
that
mean
that
any
time
a
restriction
affected
the
number
of
credit
unions
out
in
the
market,
the
bank
could
have
standing
to
challenge
that
restriction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
not,
why
not?
why
wouldn't
that
be
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
suggesting
that
maybe
the
limitation
has
to
be
on...
one
on
conduct,
rather
than
one
on
who
may
do
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
a
movement
from
where
to
who?
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
wondering
if
your
test
wouldn't
require
us
to
say,
any
restriction
that
limits
the
number
of
entities
that
may
do
business
by
meeting
certain
qualifications
would
be
subject
to
challenge
by
a
competitor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
affects
number,
and
number
always
affects
competition.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
standing
any
time
you
have
a
limitation
on
the
number
of
entities
that
may
enter
the
business.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
that
may,
by
its
natural
tendency,
limit
the
number
of
entities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
a
different
case
if
congress
had
made
an
express
finding
that
the
sole
reason
for
making
this
requirement
is
that
we
think
this
will
maximize
the
number
of
credit
unions
that
can
succeed
in
the
marketplace?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they'd
made
such
a
finding,
would
there
be
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
want
another
case.
what
about
my
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
when
i...
or,
does
that
mean
in
the
hypo
i
gave
you
you'd
say
there
was
standing,
or
was
not
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
your
understanding
there'd
be
no
standing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
probably
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
a
little...
one
tiny
question
on
history.
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
the
'32
statute
involving
the
district
of
columbia
was
enacted
during
the
hoover
administration,
and
this
statute
was
enacted
after
a
rather
dramatic
change
in
the
status
of
the
government?
