mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice;
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
pick
up
with
justice
kennedy's
question:
if
the
banks
had
known
about
this
interpretation,
they
would
have
objected.
first
of
all,
that's
beside
the
point.
you
don't
get
standing
under
the
zone
of
interest
test
simply
because
you
objected.
congress
may
not
have
accepted
your
objections.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
they
did--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i...
i
think
they
would
not
have
been
for
the
simple
reason
that
banks
were
not
in
the
business
of
making
small
consumer
loans
in
1934.
that
was
the
very
reason
you
needed
a
federal
credit
union
act
in
the
first
place,
because
nobody
was
competing
to
provide
these
loans
other
than
loan
sharks.
and
congress
had
no
interest
in
protecting
their
competitive
status.
banks
were
not
in
this
business.
that's
why
you
needed
the
act.
their
competitive
interests
were
not
in
congress'
mind.
even
if
it
had
the
interpretation
that
it
has
today,
they
were
still
not
in
that
business.
this
was
not
what
they
were
about.
and
simply
because
they
would
have
objected
doesn't
mean
congress
took
their
interest
into
account.
this
was
a
congress
that
was
not
particularly
sympathetic
to
the
interests
and
concerns
of
banks--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it...
it
resounds
throughout
the
legislative
record.
they
say
the
reason
we
need
this
statute
is
because
no
one
is
in
a
position
to
provide
small
consumer
loans.
the
small
consumer
couldn't
put
up
adequate
security
for
the
bank
to
provide
the
loan.
and
it
was
usually
in
amounts
too
small
for...
for
the
banks
to
bother
with.
over
time,
they
have
become
competitors
with
credit
unions.
but
the
question
is,
did
congress
view
them
as
competitors
in
1934?
and
did
it
enact
the
common
bond
provision
to
protect
their
status
as
competitors?
and
it
is
clear
that
they
did
not.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly.
the
purpose
of
the
provision
is
to
ensure
the
strength
and
stability
of
the
credit
union.
it's
a
cooperative
enterprise.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
argue...
the
line...
that
line
of
argument
confuses
the
article
iii
standing
inquiry
and
the
prudential
standing
inquiry.
if
it
is
enough
to
simply
show
competitive
harm
and
a
regulatory
effect
to
establish
prudential
standing,
then
there's
no
difference
between
article
iii
standing
and
prudential
standing.
this
court
has
made
clear...
most
recently,
in
the
air
courier
case...
that
there
is
a
difference,
and
article
iii
injury
is
not
sufficient
to
establish
prudential
standing.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
court
has
told
us
that
the
prudential
standing
inquiry
turns
on
congressional
intent,
not
simply
effect.
every
time
congress
imposes
a
limitation
on
a
regulated
entity,
it's
not
necessarily
acting
with
competitive
concerns
in
mind.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
see,
our--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then
that's...
that's
a
new
exception
to
the
zone
of
interest
test.
if,
for
example,
congress
passes
a
law,
saying,
we're
restricting
late-night
flights
into
national
because
of
the
noise,
that
might
benefit
bus
and
train
companies
who
provide
late-night
service.
but
they
wouldn't
have
standing
to
sue
if
the
faa
changes
the
definition
of
when
late-night
begins.
they
would
be
injured
as
competitors.
but
the
intent
of
congress
was
not
to
protect
competition--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--then,
as
the
court
has
said
in
all
the
other
prudential
standing
cases,
you
look
to
see
what
the
intent
of
congress
was.
you
start
with
the
language
of
the
statute,
as--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--arguably--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--arguably...
arguably
doesn't
mean
you
just
sort
of
have
to
get
in
the
neighborhood.
arguably
is
in
the
case
because
it's
a
standing
inquiry.
it's
not
a
determination
on
the
merits.
it
means
that
you
don't
have
to
make
a
final
decision
on
exactly
what
the
statute
was
designed
to
do,
as
you
would
in
deciding
the
merits
of
the
case,
but
appreciate
that
it's
just
a
standing
inquiry.
but
you
do
have
to
decide.
if
there
is
going
to
be
a
difference
between
an
article
iii
standing
test
and
a
prudential
standing
inquiry,
you
do
have
to
decide
what
the
intent
of
congress
was.
and
here--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
court
found
standing
in
the
data
processing
case,
but
it
has,
on
other
cases,
other
articulated
a
test
for
determining
whether
there's
standing,
and
it
said
you
looked
to
congressional
intent.
and
the
one
thing
that's
clear
here
is
that
this
provision
was
not
put
in
to
protect
banks.
it
came
from
the
credit
union
proponents.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i'll
turn
to
that
right
now,
your
honor.
the
test
is
that
the
banks
must
show
that
congress
unambiguously
expressed
its
intent
on
the
precise
question
at
issue.
the
precise
question
at
issue
is,
may
the
multiple
groups
in
a
federal
credit
union
each
have
their
own
common
bond
or
must
they
share
a
common
bond?
the
language
simply
says:
federal
credit
union
membership
shall
be
limited
to
groups
having
a
common
bond.
there
is
no
way
to
tell
from
that,
as
a
matter
of
common
parlance
or
technical
grammar,
whether
each
group
must
have
its
own
common
bond
or
whether
all
of
the
groups
in
a
federal
credit
union
must
share
the
same
common
bond.
it
is
simply
ambiguous
language.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the
community...
the
community--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
phrase
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
are
two
different
types
of
credit
unions.
the
occupational
credit
union
isn't
confined
to
a
well-defined
neighborhood.
only
the
community
credit
union
has
that
limitation.
and
although
the
court
below
said
this
gives
different
meaning
to
the...
to
the
word
"groups",
it
doesn't.
in
each
case,
"groups"
means
more
than
one
group.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you
can--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i...
i
don't
think
that's
a...
if
it
is
a
plausible
reading,
it's
not
the
only
plausible
reading
of
the
language.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
our...
our
reading
is
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
the
plural...
as
1
u.s.c.
1
provides...
the
plural
includes
the
singular.
so
that
groups
could
be
read
to...
to
include
group.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
1
u.s.c.,
section
1,
the
dictionary
act,
says,
unless
otherwise
compelled
by
the
language--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
cred...
nothing
in
the
common
bond
provision
would
prevent
that.
there
are
other
provisions
in
the
statute--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--as
the
agency
interprets
it,
it's
still
a
significant
distinction.
you
cannot
walk
down
the
street
and
turn
into
the
nearest
credit
union
and
say,
i
want
to
make
a
deposit,
or,
give
me
a
loan.
you
have
to
be
a
member
of
a
group
that
has
joined
that
credit
union
as
a
group--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--nothing
in
the
common
bond
provision
prohibits
it.
if
a
court
determines
that's
unreasonable
under
step
2
of
chevron,
it
may
be
invalid.
but
not
because
the
language
is
unambiguous
under
step
1.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
