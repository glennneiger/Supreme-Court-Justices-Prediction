justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
waxman,
the...
the
investment
company
institute
v.
camp
case
was
enacted,
of
course,
to
restrict
competition.
and
we
found
standing
there,
didn't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
i
think
that's
the...
the
closest
case
for
the
standing
argument.
i
mean,
how
do
you
get
around
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
a
competing
credit
union
have
standing
to
challenge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
roberts,
i...
i
know
you're
still
trying
to
address
standing,
but,
so
far,
nobody
has
even
talked
about
the
merits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
light
of
that
second
geographical
limitation
clause,
it...
it's
awfully
hard
to
give
it
this
broadest
reading
of
groups,
each
of
which
could
have
a
common
bond.
why
would
you
need
the
geographical
limit,
then?
i
mean,
it's
just
in...
in
the
second
part
of
the
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
just
seems
like...
like
such...
interpretation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
helfer,
the
court
below,
the
cadc,
in
finding
standing
for
the
bank,
relied
on
a
suitable
challenger
test
for
finding
standing.
do
you
defend
that
test
here,
or
should
we
look
to
the
zone
of
interest
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
do
not
defend
the
d.c.
circuit's
suitable
challenge
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
isn't
much
left
of
the
zone
of
interest
test
if
you
rely
on
the
suitable
challenger
notion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
seemed
a
little
odd
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
on
a
different...
a
different
provision.
i
mean,
you're
referring
us
to
what
happened
in
a
whole
different
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
we
have
to
ask
if
the
statutory
language
is
ambiguous.
is
it
ambiguous?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it
is,
then
we
would
defer
to
any
reasonable
interpretation
by
the
agency.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
hope
we
would
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute
to
answer
the
question
of
whether
it's
ambiguous,
not
at
some
legislative
intent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let's
look
at
the
language.
is
the
language
ambiguous?
