mr.
william
f.
terheyden
it's
mr.
terheyden,
your
honor...
oh,
i
apologize,
to
mr.
dumont,
and
to
the
court.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
petitioner's
interpretation
of
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
case
the
trust
fund
would
have
absolute
and
final
control
over
the
commencement
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
over
the
running
of
the
statute
of
limitations.
moreover,
under
their
theory
they
would
in
effect
ask
the
court
to
extend
what
is
now
a
minimum
6-year
statute
of
limitations
to
some
26-plus
years,
and
we
submit
that
congress
could
not
and
did
not
intend
such
a
result.
we
believe
that...
your
honors,
that
the
plain
words
of
the
statute,
the
plain
reading
of
the--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--no.
i
think
what
they're
saying,
that
there
are
these
individual
statutes
of
limitations
for
each
monthly
payment.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
which
would
allow
them
to,
if
they
wanted
to
wait
till
year
18
and
sue
for
6
years
prior
to
that,
they
could
do.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
well,
i
think
that's
one
of
the...
you
know,
the
fundamental
issue
here,
one
of
the
fundamental
issues
is,
can
they
divide
this
up
into
separate
statutes--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--of
limitations,
or
if
they
miss
that
first
payment--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--i
suppose
that's
one
way
of--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--well,
i
don't
think
this
is...
can
be
really
analogized
to
a
mortgage
situation,
a
loan
mortgage
situation.
i
think
here
the
question
is
there's
this
underlying
debt,
this
basic,
fundamental
debt,
and
it
really
is
just
one
debt,
one
claim,
and
i
don't
think
it
can
be
broken
up
into
a
series
of
little
claims,
of
small
claims,
so--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--that's
correct,
but
here
when
you
have
the
one
fundamental,
underlying
debt,
and
it's
supposed
to
be
paid
on
a
certain
period
of
time,
whether
it
be
a
lump
sum
or
the
commencement
of
these...
in
the
alternative
the
commencement
of
these
monthly
payments,
when
nothing
is
done,
when
nothing
is
paid
within
that
time
established
under
the
law,
under
1399(c)(2),
i
think
there
is
no
more
opportunity
to
say,
well,
we
really
have
a
series
of
debts
after
that
that
we
can
collect
on.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
that's
what
we're
saying.
that's
our
fundamental
point.
that
is
our
fundamental
position,
that's
true.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
well,
which
they
did
in
this
case.
they
accelerated
in
this
case.
they
gave
the
notice,
and
then
in
the
lawsuit
is
when
the
acceleration
took
place.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
that
was
a
point
that
petitioners
brought
up,
and
it's
a
very
good
point.
in
that
situation
they
have
effectively
agreed
to
the
whole
payment
process.
it's
just
like
a
contract.
there's
a
contract
obligation.
this
is
what
the
seventh
circuit
has
said,
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
said.
they've
given
their
assent
to
this
whole
process,
and
in
that
situation--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--you
have
a
whole
new
agreement
in
that
particular
situation.
without
question,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
sense--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--in
the
situation
where
they've
made
some
payments.
they've
made
payments.
in
that
situation,
they
have
given
their
assent
to
this
payment
process.
a
new
contract...
a
new
contract
has
effectively
been
created,
and
then
they
can
sue
in
that
situation.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
a
regular
contract.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
correct.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
if--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--if
you
haven't
made
any
payments
whatsoever,
then
they
have
6
years
to
do
something.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
i
would
take
it
it
would
be
february
1,
with
all
due
respect.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
but
they
gave
us
the
schedule
here.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
in
their
letter
to
us,
they
say
you
have
until
february
1,
because
they
track...
i
think
they
track
(c)(2).
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
if
that's
the
december
12,
19--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--okay,
and
we're
assuming
that
it
doesn't
run
from
the
time
of
withdrawal
in
this
situation.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
i
guess
we
did
view
the
letter
as
requiring
either-or
by
february
1
and
not
february
10,
in
which
case
it
would
be...
would
have
been
late.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
i
don't
know
if
that's...
if
it's...
i
don't
know
if
it's
the
end
of
this
matter,
because
we
still
have
the
ancillary
question
of
whether
it
started
at
the
time
of
withdrawal,
which
would
set
it
all
back
at
a
time
earlier.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
well,
i
guess
i
do
view
it
as
running,
your
honor,
with
one
and
the
same
time,
february
1,
and
that
the
time
of
the
first...
the
option
was
the
time
of
the...
february
1
a
time
when
the
payment
schedules
could
be
begin,
or
as
an
option,
because
it's
an
option
here.
congress
has
given
them
an
option
to
do
one
or
the
other,
and
so
i
view
those
options
as
coming
into
place
at
one
and
the
same
time,
and
so
if
the
schedule
of
monthly
payments
was
to
begin
on
february
1,
then,
since
those
options
run
at
one
and
the
same
time,
we
view
the
time
for
the
lump
sum
payment
also
to
have
begun
on
february
1.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
our
theory
there,
your
honor,
is
that
congress
has
spoken
in
section
1451(a).
we
hunted
around,
could
there
be
anything
which
says
it
only
starts...
any
statutory
provision
that
only
starts
at
the
time
of
the
first
missed
payment.
we
couldn't
find
anything,
but
section
1451
says
that
a
fiduciary,
in
this
case
a
trust
fund,
could
bring
a
lawsuit,
may
maintain
an
action
if
it
has
been
adversely
affected
by
an
act
or
omission
of
another
party.
it
may...
congress
has
said
that.
it
may
bring
an
action.
now,
at
the
time
the
company,
an
employer
withdraws,
the
trust
fund
at
that
time
is
adversely
affected.
the
contributions
are
no
longer
flowing
in,
in--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--well,
that's--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--no.
that's
an
option.
again,
that's
an
option.
it's
not...
it's...
i
know
petitioner
has
fixated,
fixed
in
on
the
payment,
but
i
think
that's
an
option.
it's
one
or
the
other.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
in
the
unlikely
event
that
it
was
filed
the
day
after
the
withdrawal
they
would
be
asking
under
1451(a)
for
the
amount
to
come
from
the
employer,
and
i
think
it
would
be
1)
in
an
amount
of
damages
to
be
proved
at
trial,
that's
what
it
would
say,
and
2)--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--i
think
at
that
point
in
time
it's
not
so
much
the...
a
wrong,
but
what
has
happened
then
is,
congress
has
said
at
the
time...
in
1381(a)
at
the
time,
employer,
you
withdraw,
you
are
liable
to
the
trust
fund.
it's
an
instantaneous
thing,
and
i
think--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--i
don't
think
it's...
of
course
not.
there's
not
a
wrong.
it's
not
illegal
to
withdraw,
but
there's--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--the
court
has
said
there's
a
cause
and
effect...
the
court
and
the
congress
has
said
there's
a
cause-effect
relationship.
they're
always
speaking
in
the
present
tense.
when
you
withdraw,
you
are
liable
to
the
trust
fund,
and
the
court
in
the
gray
case
and
the
concrete
pipe
case--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--you
have
this
obligation
to
pay
your
fair
share--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--of
the
unfunded
pension
benefits.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
but
congress
did
something
in
this
case
very
wise.
it
said,
you
may
sue.
you've
been
adversely
affected,
but
it
also
at
the
same
time
said--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--you
have
6
years.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
but
i
think
1451(f)
says
it
accrues...
it
talks
about
when
the
cause
of
action
arises.
this
is
the
one
section
which
says
when
it
arises.
when
you
read
that
in
conjunction
with
1381(a),
and
listening
to
what--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--it
says
if
you've
been
adversely
affected.
i
think
that
is
crucial
here.
a
fund
has
been
harmed.
it's
been
hurt
at
this
time.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
i
think
it's
the
one
possible
definitional
section
in
the
statute
which
explains
when
the
cause
of
action
arises,
and
that
this
cause
of
action
arises
at
the
time...
almost
a
traditional
way
that
a
cause
of
action
can
arise,
when
someone
is
harmed.
in
this
case
the
trust
fund
is
harmed,
or
adversely
affected
at
this
point
in
time.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
i
think
as
no
more
contributions
are
coming
in,
that--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--well,
i
think
the
minute
there's
a...
i
think
the
minute
there's
a
stopping
of
this
flow
of
contributions
these
unfunded
vested
benefits
are
just
going
to
get
worse.
part
of
the
contributions
go
to
reduce
the
unfunded
vested
benefits.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
no,
not
every
time.
congress--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--no...
is
adequate--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--that's
true.
that's
true,
but
even...
i
think
even
if
a
fund
is
fully
funded
it
is
still
harmed
because
these
contributions
are
no
longer
coming
in
to
fund
these
funded
benefits,
so--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--in
contract
situations,
but
again
here
i
don't
believe
that
there
is
a
contract
situation,
as
the
seventh
and
ninth--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--well--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--i
think
it's...
it's
congress
saying,
this
is
your
right,
trustees
of
trust
funds.
this
is...
and
you
may
sue
to
perfect
that
right,
and
you
have
6
years
to
do
it.
that's
a
very
long
time,
and
during
the
6
years
you
have
to
make
the
calculation
and
the
demand,
something
that
is
very
easy
to
do,
very
simple
to
do.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
makes...
that's
what
the...
that's
precisely
what
the
seventh
circuit
said,
and
the
ninth
circuit
here
in
the
case
below.
they
have
given
their
assent
to
this
process.
they
have
agreed
that
they
can
be...
that
this
sum
can
be
paid
over
a
period
of
time.
they
have
agreed
that
suit
may
be
brought
at
a
later
stage...
points
in
time,
but
until
that
happens
there
is
no
mutual
agreement
as
you
would
have
in
an
ordinary
contract
situation.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
implied
in...
i--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--i...
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--that's
true--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--the
making
of
the
payment--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--it...
that
is
an
implied
agreement
with
this
process.
it's...
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
looked
at
korman
and
they
said
the
act
of
paying
can
be
an
implied
agreement
with
the...
in
this
case
with
the
process.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
that's
how
the
contract
impliedly
arises.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
correct.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
i--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--on
that,
i...
you
know,
i
could
well
understand
somebody...
someone
saying
the
employer
hasn't
absolutely
refused
yet,
i
suppose.
unfortunately
the
alternative
to
that,
mr.
justice
breyer,
is
that
it
leaves
it
entirely
up
into
the
hands
of
the
petitioner
to
start
this
process
going.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
you
could
never
have
a
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
yes,
i
mean--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--again...
i
don't
want
to
beat
this
point
into
the
ground.
again,
that
would
be
a
contract
situation,
which
we
don't
have
here.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
i
don't
think
this
is
a
continuing
obligation
situation,
as
petitioner
has
submitted,
and--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--i
think
here...
this
whole
law
was
enacted
at
a
time
of
crisis
for
trust
funds.
employers
were
bailing
left
and
right,
and
so
congress
i
think
really
wanted
to
see
that
these
funds
move
as
swiftly
as
possible.
under
our
view,
under
our
theory
of
the
case,
we're
putting
some
teeth
into
congress'
exhortation
to
say
act
as
soon
as
practical
to
go
ahead
and
collect
this.
we're
putting
some
teeth
into--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--6
years
in
which
they
have
to
file
suit.
here
we
have
almost
8
years
before
the
suit
was
filed.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
that's
true
there
was...
in
our
view
there
is
no
obligation
that...
there's
an
underlying
obligation,
but
not
an
obligation
to
pay
pursuant
to
a
payment
schedule.
there
is
a--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--i
think...
you
know,
i
can't
think
of
one
precisely,
but
in
this
situation,
as
you
know,
we
say
the
claim
has
ripened,
but
i
think--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--but
i
think,
your
honor,
if
this
was
a...
if
it
were
the
last
of
the
6
years,
the
last
day
of
the
sixth
year
and
the
trust
fund
hadn't
done
anything,
i
think
certainly
it
could--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--yes.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
in
the...
this
is--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--i
understand.
this
is
what
happened
in
the
joyce
case,
which...
one
of
the
main
cases
petitioner
relies
on.
the
trust
fund
sent
out
the
demand
on
the
very
same
day
they
filed
the
lawsuit,
and
the
issue
was
brought
up
there,
was
this
premature
or
not,
and
the
reason...
the
trust
fund
said
the
reason
we
did
it
is
because
we
weren't
sure
when
the
statute
of
limitations
ran,
but
we'd
better
make
sure
we
protect
our
rights,
and
i
think
that's
what
the
fund
would
have
to
do
here.
it
could
file
the
suit
to
protect
it--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--but
by
then
it
was
no...
yes,
and
then
it
was
no
longer
premature.
i
think
here
they
could
file
the
suit
and
the
court
could--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--yes,
but
the
employer
hadn't
refused
at
that
point,
at
time
they
filed
suit,
and
they
were
able
to
stay
into
court,
because
by
the
time
it
came
up
through
the
court,
the
district
court
system,
they...
there
was
no
payment
by
the
employer,
so
they
were
legitimately
able
to
file
their
lawsuit
the
same
day
they
sent
the
payment.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
that's
true.
they
were
saying,
i
think...
there
the
employer
said,
as
we
do
here,
it
adhered
back
to
the
time
of
the
actual
withdrawal.
but
i
think
my
point
there
is
there's
nothing
to
really...
to
stop
them
to
meet
this
long
6-year
statute
of
limitation
where
nothing
has
been
done,
where
no...
to
meet
this
statute
of
limitation,
where
they
haven't
done
anything
to
protect
their
rights
and
the
court
could
very
easily
stay
the
action.
they
could
very
easily...
otherwise,
i'm
afraid
it's
just
going
to
go
further
and
further
into
the
future.
they
could...
they'd
come
back
and
if
nothing's
done
in
8
years
or
in
10
years--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--they
said,
you
know...
that's
true.
they're
losing
some
interest.
they
say
perhaps
a
suit
for
breach
of
fiduciary
obligation
can
be
brought
against
the
trustees,
but
our
view,
your
honor,
gives
it
some
teeth.
it
says
there's
a
penalty
here.
if
you
don't
do
anything
here
in
6
years
you
will
incur
a
penalty.
and
look
what
happens
when
it
goes
on
beyond
the
6
years.
when
nothing
is
done
is
what
happened
in
this
case.
we
now--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--that's
right.
they
would
lose
it
all,
your
honor.
they
would
lose
it
all,
and
here
if
this
keeps
going
beyond
the
6
years,
what
you
have
in
this
case,
by
this
time
you
have
an
insolvent
trust
fund
and
a
defunct
employer
because
it's
gone
on
so
long.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
but
i
think
policy
wise
the
longer
it
goes
on
the
employers
could
move,
the
employers
could
go
out
of
business--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--the
employers
could
become
defunct--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--no,
but
that
certainly
doesn't
serve
the
purposes
of
the
act,
serve
the
purposes
of
the
beneficiaries,
i
don't
believe,
if
that
happens.
if
there's
nothing
that
actually
compels
them
to
do
it--
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
--yes,
that's
true,
as
soon
as
practical,
and
i
give
absolute
pause
with
that
exhortation
by
congress
to
act
as
soon
as
practical.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
well,
i
think
it
really
compels
them
to
move
forward
and
do
something.
i
think
it
really
gives
them
some
real,
definitive,
objective
hammer,
if
you
will,
that
they'd
better
act
now,
especially
in
a
situation
where
there's
been
nothing,
nothing
done.
i
understand
it's
different
in
a
schedule
payment
situation
where
there
has
been
something
done.
there's
been
an
effort,
and
that's
why
in
those
situations
certainly
you
can...
it
can
go
on
for
a
longer
period.
if
there's
no
further
questions,
i'll
yield
back
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
william
f.
terheyden
thank
you
very
much.
