ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
1980
erisa
amendments
set
up
a
complicated,
complex
scheme
for
assuring
the
long-run
stability
of
multiemployer
plans,
pension
plans,
when
employers
for
many
perfectly
valid
reasons,
legal
reasons,
cease
making
contributions
to
the
plans.
that
scheme
requires
that
some
but
not
all
withdrawing
employers
make
withdrawal
liability
payments
in
amounts
that
are
dictated
by
the
statute
under
a
periodic
payment
scheme
that
can
extend
for
as
long
as
20
years,
and
that
is
also
largely
dictated
by
the
statute.
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
when
a
cause
of
action
to
collect
one
or
more
of
those
unpaid
withdrawal
liability
payments
accrues
under
the
1980
act.
the
answer
to
that
question
in
our
view
is
rather
simple
and
straightforward,
and
it
depends
on
two
fundamental
principles
of
statute
of
limitations
law.
the
first,
and
on
this
point
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
among
the
parties,
is
that
ordinarily
a
limitations
period
runs
from
when
a
cause
of
action
accrues,
and
in
this
statute
that's
made
quite
explicit
by
1451(a),
and
that
means
when
the
plaintiff
can
first
file
a
lawsuit,
not
before.
the
statute
here
so
states
in
1451(a)
that
the...
there's
a
cause
of
action...
in
1451(f),
i'm
sorry,
that
the
limitations
period
runs
from
when
the
cause
of
action
arose.
the
second
principle,
and
here
the
consensus
among
the
parties
i
think
somewhat
collapses,
is
that
a
plaintiff's
right
to
file
suit
ordinarily
is
triggered
by
some
breach
of
duty
by
the
potential
defendant
as
defined
by
the
relevant
legal
rules.
here
that's
the
1980
act,
and
the
rules
that
it
sets
up
for
determining
when
the
defendant,
potential
defendant,
the
employer
in
this
case,
is
required
to
make
payments,
so
unless
one
knows
when
the
employer
has
breached
a
legal
obligation
one
really
can't
make
a
sensible
decision
about
when
the
statute
of
limitations
starts
to
run.
that
is,
there
has
to
be
a
situation
in
which
a
court
could
issue
a
corrective
order
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff
and
against
the
defendant
in
order
for
a
cause
of
action
to
accrue,
so
the
limitations
decision
is
really
the
flip
side
of
a
set
of
understandings
about
what
obligations,
duties,
and
rights
the
statute
sets
up
to
begin
with
and
can't
be
looked
at
in
isolation.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
interest
runs
on
withdrawal
liability
payments,
but
in
an
odd
way
that
was
described
by
this
court
in
schlitz.
that
is,
once
the
demand
has
been
made,
once
there
has
been
an
assessment
and
a
demand
and
a
stated
period
in
which
the
payments
have
to
be
made,
then
interest
runs
on
payments--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--it
doesn't
run
from
the
date
of
withdrawal,
and
if
the
fund
does
not
assess
the
withdrawal
for
some
period
of
time
it
runs
only,
as
described
by
this
court
in
schlitz,
as
if
the
payment
was
made
on
the
first
day
of
the
date
following
withdrawal
no
matter
when
they're
actually
made,
even
if
it
the
demand
isn't
to
make
them
until
sometime
later.
so
to
apply
these
general
principles
to
this
case,
there
are
really
three
factors
that
are
the
most
important.
the
first
is
that
the
withdrawal
itself
is
not
a
violation
of
any
legal
obligation,
ceasing
to
make
contributions
is
not
the
violation
of
any
legal
obligation,
and
that
the
date
of
withdrawal
is
often
determined
after
the
fact
by
a
set
of
events
that
occur
after
what
is
later
decided
to
be
the
date
of
withdrawal.
so
the
date
of
withdrawal
is
really
a
datum
in
a
bunch
of
calculations,
and
not
a
date
on
which
an
employer
is
supposed
to
do
anything,
and
what
that
means
for
purposes
of
the
limitations
inquiry
here
is
that
if
the
fund
had
tried
to
sue
the
employer
on
the
date
of
withdrawal
they
would
have
been
summarily
dismissed
from
their
lawsuit
because
no
demand
had
been
made
for
payment
and
the
employer
had
no
obligation
to
pay
anything.
the
second
critical
factor
is
that
the
employer
does
violate
the
statute
once
it
fails
to
pay
any
withdrawal
liability
payment
on
the
schedule
that
is
set
by
the
fund
in
the
demand
letter,
again
largely
prescribed
by
the
statute.
that
is
the
schedule
and
the
amount
both.
so
what
we
have
here
is
sort
of
like
a...
any
bill,
like
a
telephone
or
a
credit
card
or
a
legal
bill
or
a
hospital
bill
in
which
there
is
a
liability
that
is
incurred
regarding
facts
that
occur
on
a
certain
date,
but
until
you
get
a
bill
that
requires
you
to
make
a
payment
there's
no
obligation
to
pay,
no
obligation
that
has
been
breached,
and
no
potential
lawsuit
until
that
date.
and
this
rule
is
a
rule
that,
although
the
employer
in
this
case
seems
to
take
issue
with
it,
is
one
that
has
been
understood
by
hundreds
of
courts
over
hundreds
of
years,
including
this
court
in
a
series
of
cases
including
rawlings
v.
ray
and
others.
that
is
that
ordinarily
when
you're
dealing
with
a
debt
a
cause
of
action
accrues
on
a
date
that
there
is
an
obligation
to
pay
the
debt,
and--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--well,
that's
correct
as
well,
although
it
was
the
third
point
that
i
was
going
to
make,
and--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--there
are
two
things
to
be
said
about
that.
one
is
that
the
reason,
of
course,
why
it
is
possible
that
there
could
be
suits
for
failure
to
pay,
make
payments
for
a
long
period,
is
because
congress
allowed
a
long
period
in
which
these
payments
to
be
made.
in
other
words,
congress
could
have
required
that
the
payment
be
made
up
front,
but
in
fact,
and
largely
for
the
benefit
of
employers
and
so
as
not
to
require
them
to
make
huge
payments
immediately--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--correct.
this
provision
has
an
express
permissive
acceleration
clause
which
says
that
the
plan's
sponsor
may
accelerate
upon
a
default
as
defined
in
the
statute.
the
statute
defines
default
in
a
particular
way
so
that
there
needs
to
be
a
notice,
first,
of
delinquency
and
then
60
days
from
that
notice
before
a
default
could
be
declared.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
on
the
first
instalment,
and
on
each
instalment
as
it
came
due,
because
the
debt
was
not
in
fact
accelerated
and
because
of
the
additional
fact
that
under
the
more
specific
aspects
of
the
statutory
scheme
it
actually
could
not
have
been
accelerated
because
although,
as
i
said
before,
there
is
a
permissive
acceleration
clause,
it
was
not
operative
during
the
relevant
periods
in
this
case,
and
it
wasn't
operative
because
first
it
was
too
early,
that
is,
the
60
days
had
not
run
at
any
period
of
time
outside--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that's
correct.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
let
me
see
if
i
can
understand.
there
are
two
different
time
or
issues
that
you
might
be
referring
to.
one
is
the
question
which,
while
not
passed
on
by
the
court
below
because
of
the
view
it
took
that
the
date
runs
from
withdrawal,
has
been
addressed
by
other
courts
of
appeals,
that
is,
by
the
third
circuit
and
by
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is
a
purely
legal
issue,
and
that
is,
if
one
agrees
that
the
limitations
period
runs
from
missed
payments,
not
from
the
date
of
withdrawal,
does
it
run
as
it
would
under
the
common
law
with
respect
to
instalment
payments
generally--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that's
true.
i
would
argue
that
this
is
an
area
in
which
some
guidance
and
certainty
is
of
some
use
to
the
practitioners
and
to
the
funds,
and
there
is,
i
would
say...
the
issue
is
certainly
presented
by
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
the
overall
issue
of
when
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
or
begins
to
run
and
in
what
manner
is
presented
by
the
case.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
it's--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--if...
then
i
think
that
you
are
assuming
a
second
issue,
other
than
the
time
by...
than
the
periodic-payment-by-periodic-payment
issue,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
first
payment...
this
lawsuit
was
timely
with
respect
to
the
first
payment,
and
we
do
argue
that
it
was
timely
with
respect
to
the
first
payment,
and--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--that's
true.
there
is
some
dispute
as
to
whether
that's
the
case,
and
if
you
accept
our
position
that
even
as
to
the
first
missed
payment
this
suit
was
timely,
because
the
earliest
that
we
could
have
required
it
to
be
paid
was
at
the
end
of
a
60-day
period
from
the
demand--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--all
right,
but
that
is
separate
from
the
issue
of
whether
we
necessarily
prevail
without
deciding
that
question,
and
the
answer
is
we
do
not
necessarily
prevail
because
of
the
schedule
here,
and
perhaps
i
can
clarify
that.
we
filed
suit
here
on
february
9,
1993.
that
was
within
the
6-year
period
from
the
date
on
which
the
demand
letter
required
the
entire
withdrawal
liability
to
be
paid
if
the
employer
so
choose...
chose
under
the
prepayment
option.
it
was
within
6
years
of
the
date
on
which
we
understand
the
statute
to
have
permitted
the
first
payment
to
have
been
required,
also
60
days,
but
the
demand
letter
actually
said
february
1,
1987,
so
the
only
argument
on
which
we
possibly
do
not
prevail
on
the
entire
debt...
and
here
we're
talking
about
a
difference
of
$345...
is
if
one
views
the
lawsuit
as
not
timely
from
the
date
of
the
first
missed
payment,
because
we
said
in
our
demand
letter
that
it
was
due
on
february
1,
although
in
our
view
that
was
a
legal
error.
actually
it
was
due
on
february
10,
if
that's
at
all
clarified.
so
there
are
views
of
this
case
on
which
it
does
matter
whether
the
limitations
period
runs
on
a
instalment-by-instalment
basis,
and
other
views
on
which
it
doesn't
matter.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
well,
if
i'm
right
on
the
first
payment
being
timely
then
you
don't
need
to.
i'm
saying
that's
in
some
dispute.
that
question
is
in
some
dispute.
if
i
can
go
briefly
to
what
i
understand--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--no.
actually
we
believe
that
it
is
for
each
payment
due
on
the
date
that
the
payment
becomes
overdue,
unless
the
plan's
sponsor
elects
to
invoke--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--when
it
was
not
paid
is
when
that
particular
payment
is
not
due,
but
that--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i
sort
of
hate
to
get
side-tracked
on
it,
because
it's
a
$345
problem.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
but
we
would
maintain,
and
do
in
the
briefs,
that
there
is
a
view
of
the
statute
on
which
we
were
timely
with
respect
to
the
first
payment.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
no,
the
view
of
the--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--statute
is
that
the
statute
required
us
to
wait
60
days
to
collect
the
first
missed
payment,
and
that
when
we
said
that
it
was
due
on
february
1
we
were
in
error.
it
couldn't
have
been
that
date.
it
really
had
to
be
february
10.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
no.
we
would
maintain
on
that
view
that
it
couldn't
have
been
overdue.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
of
the
demand.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
that's
correct.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
and
that
is
the
view
on
which
every...
we
are
timely
with
respect
to
the...
every...
each
and
every
payment,
but
as
i
say,
that
is
really
in
some
ways
the
least
important
problem
here,
because--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--right,
exactly,
and
if
you
were
to
conclude
that
we
were
right
about
that,
then
you
really
wouldn't
have
to
decide
the
payment-by-payment
issue,
and
if
you
were
not,
then
you
would
have
to
go
on
to
decide
whether,
although
the
first
missed
payment
had...
was
gone,
every
other
payment
was
within
the
time
period,
as
any
instalment
contract
lawyer
would,
you
know,
quickly
conclude.
i
want
to
just
very
briefly,
before
reserving
the
rest
of
my
time,
to
comment
on
one
issue
that
the
employer
here
has
harped
on
quite
frequently,
and
that
is
the
contention
that
on
our
view
of
the
statute,
that
is
that
it
can...
the
limitations
period
cannot
possibly
run
from
the
date
of
withdrawal,
that
there
is
some
fundamental
problem
because
then
we
are...
we
can
indefinitely
delay
assessment,
and
the
plain
answer
to
that
is
that
the
congress
did
deal
with
that
problem.
it
dealt
with...
saw
the
timeliness
issues
here
as
two
different
ones,
one
dealing
with
the
timeliness
of
the
demand
and
one
dealing
with
the
timeliness
of
the
lawsuit.
with
respect
to
the
timeliness
of
the
demand,
the
statute
specifically
provides
that
that
has
to
be
done
as
soon
as
practicable.
that
is
an
enforceable
provision
of
the
statute
like
any
other
provision
of
the
statute,
and
does
not
at
all
lead
to
the
kinds
of
problems
that
the
employer
suggests.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
we...
in
the
alternative.
there
were--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--the--
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
--i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
amount
to
an
election
of
the
option
for
two
reasons,
first
because
it
was
a
fourth
cause
of
action
which
was
simply
for
all
the
missed
payments
and
a
future
injunction,
and
secondly
because
it
was
later
in
interrogatories
in
the
case,
which
are
not
in
the
record
before
the
court,
agreed
that
in
fact
that
acceleration
was
improper.
it
was
improper
both
because
it
was
too
early
and
because
there
was
a
pending
arbitration
in
the
case,
and
under
the
pbgc's
rules
you
cannot
accelerate
while
there's
a
pending
arbitration.
so
even
if
one
viewed
the
complaint
as
an
attempt
to
accelerate,
it
was
an
ineffective
attempt
to
accelerate,
an
invalid
attempt
to
accelerate.
thank
you.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
ms.
marsha
s.
berzon
i'd
like
to
address
two
things.
first,
it's
important
to
be
clear
that...
and
i
think
it
is
clear
that
this
is
a
statutory
obligation.
that
is,
the
schedule
is
a
statutory
obligation,
and
the
employer,
while
it
has
the
option
to
prepay
under
1399(c)(4),
it
doesn't
have
the
option
to
not
pay
and
say
that
it
has
chosen
a
total
payment
option
but
it
isn't
doing
it.
the
statute
isn't
set
up
that
way.
the
statute
is
set
up
with
a
baseline
obligation
to
pay
on
a
schedule,
a
periodic
payment
basis,
and
the
only
way
that
the
employer
doesn't
have
to
meet
that
payment-by-payment
obligation
is
if
it
prepays
the
entire
amount.
this
employer
has
not
prepaid
the
entire
amount,
and
therefore
it
had
a
prepay...
a
payment-by-payment
obligation
which
was
not
contractual,
which
should
not
depend
upon
it
making
the
first
payment
at
all,
but
which
went
into
effect
with
the
demand
letter
and
stayed
there
for
the
entire
period
that
the
payments
were
due.
that's
the
first
point.
and
the
second
point
is,
which
is
related,
is
to
respond
to
justice
breyer's
dealing
with
this
case
in
particular,
and
i
would
agree
with
perhaps
the
slight
twist
in
the
explanation.
on
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix
the
demand
letter
does,
indeed,
say
that
$45,570
can
be
paid
within
60
days
after
the
receipt
of
this
letter,
which
was
actually
probably
sometime
after
february
10
would
have
been
due,
and
then
says
that
there
is
an
option
to
make
a
payment-by-payment
instalment
instead.
if,
in
fact,
for
all
the
reasons
we
stated,
it
is
the
payment-by-payment
obligation
which
is
the
statutory
obligation,
and
absent
a
permissive
acceleration
by
the
fund
at
a
time
when
it
can
make
the
acceleration,
which
it
couldn't
here,
that's
the
only
obligation.
but
if
somehow
one
thought
that
there
was
another
obligation,
i.e.,
a
lump
sum
payment,
we
know
when
that
was
one
due,
and
it
was
due
within
the
limitations
period,
so
there's
no
way
to
take
the
failure--

--it
was
actually
60
days
from
when
they
received
the
letter,
so
it
would
have
been
a
little
after
that.

they
didn't
have
an
obligation
to
pay
in

they
only
had

obligation--

correct,
