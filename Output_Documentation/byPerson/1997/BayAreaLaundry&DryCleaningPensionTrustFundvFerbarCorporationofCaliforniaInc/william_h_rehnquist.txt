we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-370,
the
bay
area
laundry
and
dry
cleaning
pension
trust
fund
v.
ferbar
corporation
of
california.
ms.
berzon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
ms.
berzon.
mr.
dumont.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you're
saying
that
even
though
the
schedule
set
forth
a
date
before
the
sixty-first
day,
suit
would
be
timely
6
years
after
the
sixty-first
day,
and
that
there
was
a
failure
to
pay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
a
mortgage
securing
a
loan,
that
it's...
you
know,
you
borrow
$50,000,
and
the
lender
puts
up
$50,000,
but
your
duty
to
repay
is
not
to
repay
$50,000
in
any
lump
sum,
but
to
pay
so
much
each
month,
representing
principal
and
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
the
statute
begins
to
run
at
the
time
of
withdrawal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
your
theory,
mr.
terheyden,
as
to
why
the
statute
of
limitations
should
begin
running
from
the
date
of
withdrawal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
a
substitute
that
the
statute
provides,
this
payment...
the
series
of
payments,
isn't
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
that
a
compensation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
you
don't
know
what
it
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
know
what
the
obligation
is
until
the
plan
sends
out
the
notice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there's
any
analogy
to
contract
law
it
seems
to
me
the
most
you
can
say
about
the...
it's
like
an
anticipatory
breach,
saying
that
in
the
future
i'm
not
going
to
do
something
that
i'm
obligated,
and
for
an
anticipatory
breach,
that's
at
the
election
of
the
payee.
they
can
exercise
it
or
not.
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
very
idea
of
a
6-year
statute
of
limitations
suggests
that
they
did
not
regard
it
as
terribly
urgent.
i
mean,
we
have
6-month
statutes
of
limitations.
6
years
suggested
that
they
were
willing
to
have
people
take
their
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
terheyden.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
berzon,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
berzon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
