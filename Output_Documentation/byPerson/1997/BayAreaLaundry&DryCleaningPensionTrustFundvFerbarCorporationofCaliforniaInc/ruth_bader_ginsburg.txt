justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
berzon,
you
keep
mentioning
the
60
days,
but
as
i
understand
it,
that's...
that
has
never
been
passed
on
by
any
court.
we
have
a
decision
from
the
court
of
appeals
that
we
are
reviewing
that
puts
you
out
of
the
ball
park
entirely
because
it
dates
the
time
from
the
withdrawal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
argument
that
you
made
in
your
brief
about
the
60-day
period
as
i
understand
it
was
not
passed
on
by
any
court
below,
so
you
may
be
wrong,
or
you
may
be
right
about
it,
but
you
are
asking
us
to
take
a
first
view
of
that
question,
which
ordinarily
we
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
should
we
reach
that
question
when
the
court
we're
reviewing
hasn't
reached
it?
we
don't
know
what
position
they
would
take
if
they
hadn't
gotten
the
first
thing
wrong,
if
they
hadn't
used
the
withdrawal
date,
and
you're
arguing...
that's
your
basic
proposition.
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
about
that,
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
if
they're
wrong
about
that,
then
there
are
further
issues
that
other
courts
of
appeals
have
addressed
but
this
one
never
reached.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
right
about
the
60
days,
so
your
whole
thing
would
be
timely,
this
other
question
about
each
instalment
is
academic
in
your
case
because
it
wouldn't
matter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
whole
thing
would
be
timely.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
if
you're
right
about
that,
that...
the
rest
of
it
doesn't
matter
because
you're
in
under
the
wire.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
that's
something
that
you
have
urged
and
that
has
not
been
passed
on
by
any
other
court,
so
i
understand
that
the
first
question
is
certainly
before
us,
but
i
don't
understand
that
anything
else
is
because
it
hasn't...
we
would
be
acting
as
a
court
of
first
view,
not
a
court
of
review.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
right
about
even
the
first
payment,
that
you
were
timely,
then
why
should
we
get
to
the
question
of
instalment
or
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
are
rejecting
their
60-day--under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
the
first...
they
sued
too
late
to
recover
the
first
payment,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
you
think
that
60-day
is
so
clearly
wrong
on
the
petitioner's
part
that
it
shouldn't
be
something
that
we
should
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
which
never
considered
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
an
argument
that
the
suit
on
the
merits
shouldn't
go
forward
because
an
arbitration
request,
demand
had
been
made
and
not
responded
to?
how
does
that
play
into
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying,
then,
you
can
have
a
claim
for
relief
that's
unripe?
i
mean,
do
you
agree
that
at
the
point
when
withdrawal
liability
kicks
in
the
employer
has
done
nothing
wrong?
there's
no
wrong
until
there's
a
payment
due
that
has
not
been
paid.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what's
the
claim
for
relief
for,
when
all
that's
been
done
is
something
that
the
statute
doesn't
say
is
unlawful?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
liable
for
what?
if
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
was
struck
by
what
you
said,
and
i
looked
at
this
section
1451(a)
on
page
17a,
and
it
says,
persons
entitled
to
maintain
actions,
and
i
said,
yeah,
i
recognize
that.
that
answers
who,
and
then
i
looked,
i
find
out
a
plan
fiduciary,
et
cetera.
that's
typical
of
statutory...
there's
a
who
question
and
a
when
question,
and
you
are
referring
us
to
the
who
question
to
answer
the
when
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
does
it
say
anything
about
where
it
arises?
it
says
persons
entitled
to
maintain
an
action,
and
this--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
says,
when
you
are
adversely
affected,
you
are
the
people
who
can
sue.
these
are
the
people
who
can
sue.
why
isn't
this
just
such
a
familiar,
who
may
sue,
like
standing,
who
has
standing
to
sue,
not
when
you
begin
your
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
their
view
they
had
nothing
to
sue
for
because
there
was
nothing...
no
wrong
was
done,
no
obligation
was
incurred
until
there
was
a
payment
schedule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
other
examples
where
a
statute
of
limitations
starts
to
run
before
the
claim
ripens,
at
a
point
where
we
don't
know
whether
there's
going
to
be
any
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
hasn't,
because
you
would...
i
thought
you
conceded
that
if
the
complaint
were
to
be
filed
the
day
after
the
withdrawal,
the
permanent
withdrawal
occurred
there
would
be
no
relief
possible
because
the
employer
hasn't
done
anything
to
be
obligated
to
pay
anything.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we're
talking
about
when
the
claim
accrued,
not
the
last
day
of
the
6
years.
we're
talking
about
the
starting
gun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
don't
know
of
a
situation
where
the
starting
gun
goes
off
before
you
have
a
claim,
before
you
have
a
ripe
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they...
and
then
joyce
gave
them
an
answer,
right,
and
the
answer
was
the
claim
doesn't
accrue
until
the
first
payment
is
due,
until
there's
a...
payment
is
due.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
mean,
when
you...
i'm
not
following
your
example
of
joyce,
because
joyce
was
presented,
as
you
say,
in
a
climate
where
the
law
was
uncertain,
so...
but
there
was
a
determination
of
the
payments
that
were
due.
the
schedule
was
out,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so...
but
there
was
a
claim
by
the
employer's...
on
the
employer's
part
that
that
claim
was
untimely,
right,
in
joyce,
because
it
wasn't
within
6
years
from
when
the
withdrawal
liability...
from
when
the
withdrawal
occurred.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if...
you
say
there's
nothing
that
impels
the
trustee,
the
plan
trustees
to
do
this
faster?
i
mean,
they
are
losing
at
least
interest,
aren't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
not
as
to
penalty.
you
say
there's
no
liability
at
all
because
it's
time-barred.
