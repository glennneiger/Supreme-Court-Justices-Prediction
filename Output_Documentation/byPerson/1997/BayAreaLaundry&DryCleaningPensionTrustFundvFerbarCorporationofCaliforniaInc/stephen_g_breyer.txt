justice
stephen
g.
breyer
one
minor
question.
i'm
thinking
of
the
first
payment...
oh,
well,
forget
it.
i'll
ask
the
other...
i'll
ask--
--thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
terheyden.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
is...
i
mean,
i
thought
it
was...
i
have
a
30-year
mortgage,
all
right,
and
if
i
miss
the
358th
payment,
which
i
guess
would
be
in
the
year
2020,
if
i'm
around,
then
i
guess
they
could
sue
for
that,
and
what
they're
saying
is
your
interpretation
would
mean
they're
free
to
pay
it
or
not.
i
mean,
the
bank
would...
i
think...
i
don't
think
the
bank
would
be
very
happy
if
i
took
that
view.
i'd
say,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
you
the
358th
payment.
sue
me.
unfortunately,
the
statute
of
limitations
began
to
run
when
i
took
out
the
mortgage.
i
mean,
what
kind
of
a
law
would
that
be,
and
why
would
congress
want
such
a
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
this
case,
then,
all
you're
saying
is
there's
a
special
rule
when
you
miss
your
first
payment.
anybody
who
misses
the
first
payment's
out
of
luck,
and
it's...
for
everybody--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--everybody
who
makes
a
first
payment,
it...
you
agree
with
that.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
out
of
curiosity,
in
respect
to
that
first
payment,
i
take
it
that
you
and
the
solicitor
general
are
reading
(c)(2),
there
has
to
be
a
cause
of
action.
i
take
it
everybody
agrees
you
get
6
years
from
when
the
cause
of
action
arises.
then
the
question
is,
when
does
it
arise,
and
(c)(2)
begins
by
saying,
withdrawal
liability
shall
be
payable
in
accordance
with
the
schedule
set
forth
by
the
sponsor,
but
the
schedule
can't
extend
it
beyond
60
days,
all
right.
so
that
i
looked
at
the
schedule,
and
the
schedule
seems
to
say,
on
page
24,
that
they
have
a
choice.
they
can
either
have
a
schedule
of
payments,
in
which
case
the
first
one
is
due
on
february
1,
or
they
could
pay
the
whole
thing
in
a
lump
sum
60
days
thereafter,
which
i
take
it
would
be
february
10.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
says
you
may
pay
the
withdrawal
liability
set
forth
in
the
preceding
paragraph,
that's
45,000
some
odd
dollars,
by
a
single
lump
sum
payment
within
60
days
after
your
receipt
of
this
letter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
that's
right.
they
said
you
may
either
do
it...
you
don't
know
what
my
question
is,
so...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
the
factual
premise
is
right.
the
factual
premise
is
that
they
told
you
that
you
could
either
do
it
in
a
lump
sum
60
days
after,
which
would
be
february...
it
doesn't
say
you
may
pay
the
withdrawal--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
maybe
i'm
not
reading
the
right
letter.
my
letter
has
a
paragraph
on
page
24,
you
may
pay
in
a
lump
sum
within
60
days.
then
the
next
paragraph,
the
act
also
permits
a
schedule,
in
which
case
the
first
payment
is
due
by
february
1.
am
i
reading
the
right
thing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
page
24.
if
i'm
reading
the
right
thing,
then
i
imagine
it's
now
february
8.
i
wondered
how
there
could
be
a
cause
of
action
on
february
8,
since
the
trustee
would
not
yet
know
which
had
been
chosen.
if
the
trustee
did
not
know
which
had
been
chosen,
how
would
there
be
a
cause
of
action
yet,
since
they
have
till
february
10
to
make
the
election,
and
if
there
is
no
cause
of
action
on
february
8,
then
how
can
it
be
that
the
statute
starts
to
run?
that
was
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
i
will
not
make
any
assumption.
i'm
saying,
i
read
you
the
two
paragraphs,
and
i
said,
that...
i
am
assuming
that
they
say
you
have
till
february
10
to
make
the
election.
if
that's
so,
it
sounds
as
if
on
february
8
there
was
no
cause
of
action
yet,
because
they
had
till
february
10.
now,
i'm
putting
it
as
a
question.
i'm
not
making
a
statement.
i
want
to
know
what
your
response
to
that
problem
is.
you
can
it
isn't
a
problem
and
explain
why,
whatever
you'd
like.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
court
of
appeals
also,
has
my
reading
of
it
on
page
2a,
it
says
it
could
either
make
a
lump
sum
payment
in
60
days,
or
it
could
begin
installment
payments
on
february
1.
but
if
that's
a
correct
reading,
then
is
that
the
end
of
this
matter?
then--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--unless
we
say
withdrawal,
and
if
that's
right
then
they
can
get
the
first
payment
and
everything
in
your
view,
if
we
reject
your
argument
as
to
the
withdrawal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
so
either
they
do...
on
your
theory...
i'm
just
interested
in
your
theory.
on
your
theory,
they
agree
to
the
schedule
of
payments
or
they
don't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now
you're
saying,
if
they
do,
then
fine.
then
we
have
the
bank
collecting
the
mortgage.
but
if
they
don't,
now,
then
what?
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
imagine
they
don't.
they're
never
going
to
agree
to
this
condition
of
all
the
payments.
they're
always
never
going
to
agree
to
it.
very
well,
then
on
that
theory
why
isn't
it
the
case
that
they
withdraw,
then
they
get
a
notice,
then
they
have
60
days
from
that
time,
since
they're
never
going
to
agree
to
the
schedule,
and
then
they
can
bring
their
lawsuit,
and
on
that
theory
it
would
still
be
timely.
it
would
have
been
until
february
10
they
would
have
had.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
does
your
theory
work
on
that
branch
of
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--oh,
yes,
just
as
for
example,
if
i
make
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
it's
rather
like
the
bank.
let's
say
we
get
into
an
odd
agreement...
i
grant
you
this
would
be
a
little
odd,
but
i
don't
have
to
make
my
first
mortgage
payment
until
the
bank
requests
it.
well,
i
guess
that
would
be
up
to
them.
you're
right,
the
thing
would
never
come
to
rest
as
long
as
they
didn't
ask
me
to
make
my
first
payment.
but
however,
they
might
see
a
problem
with
that.
i
mean,
they
might
ask,
and
i
guess
the
trustee's
in
the
same
boat.
