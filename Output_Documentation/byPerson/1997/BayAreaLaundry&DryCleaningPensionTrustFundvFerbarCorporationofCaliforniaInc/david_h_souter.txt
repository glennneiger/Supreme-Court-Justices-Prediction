justice
david
h.
souter
why
don't
you
take
the
position
that
counsel
for
the
petitioner
does
that
the
60-day
rule
with
respect
to
the
first
payment
actually
makes
the
date
of
adverse
consequence
the
date
upon
which
it
could
have
been
demanded...
the
date
upon
which
it
could
have
been
collected
rather
than
the
date
upon
which
they
demanded
the
payment
to
be
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
would...
if
they
sued
on
the
stated
day,
which
was
before
the
sixty-first
day,
would
they
be
subject
to
a
motion
to
dismiss?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
answer
is
no?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
consequence,
i
take
it,
of
what
you're
saying
is,
going
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
that
if
they
pay
all
their
installments
for
6
years
and
the
seventh
year
comes,
and
they
start
paying,
there's
no
possible
collection
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
so
we
have
a
whole
new
agreement.
