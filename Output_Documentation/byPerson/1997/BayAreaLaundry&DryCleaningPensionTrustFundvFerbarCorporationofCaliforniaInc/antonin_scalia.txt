this
60-day
dispute
for
purposes
of
the
present
case
is
only
relevant
as
to
the
first
payment,
but
the
issue,
the
issue
of
whether
the
60
days
is
what
counts
or
not,
applies
to
every
payment
set
under
this
scheme,
doesn't
it?
it's
not
just
the
first
payment.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
what
i'm...
as
i
read
the
statute,
it
says
the
failure
of
an
employer
to
pay
any
overdue
withdrawal
liability
payment,
any
payment,
not
just
the
first,
within
60
days
after
the
employer
receives
written
notification
from
the
plan's
sponsor
that
the
payment
is
overdue.
isn't
that
the
60-day
provision
you're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
which
one
are
you
talking
about
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
give
me
the
u.s.
code
cite,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
(c)(2).
i
have
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now,
why
wouldn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it
is
a
default,
but
not
a
default
within
the
meaning
of
the
provision
of
the
act
that
allows
acceleration.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
what
particular
situation?
i
don't
know
what
particular
situation
you're--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
it
becomes
like
a
regular
mortgage.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
sue
payment
by
payment.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
that
a
contract
somehow
springs
into
existence
if
the
withdrawing
employer
makes
the
first
payment.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
this
implied
in
fact,
or
implied
in
law?
i
mean,
do
you
really...
is
this
supposed
to
be
an
estimation
of
what
was
genuinely
in
the
mind
of
whoever
made
the
first
payment?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
you
could
say...
you
could
say
that.
you
could
say,
you
know,
by
doing
this
you
have
agreed
to,
but
is
it
true?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
have
they
agreed
to
it
because
you
say
so,
or
have
they
agreed
to
it
because
somehow
the
making
of
the
payment--
justice
antonin
scalia
--genuinely
represents
some
contractual
undertaking?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
the
runners
know
in
which
direction
to
run,
so
to
speak.
[laughter]
or
how
far.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
employers
may
be
able
to
escape
the
liability,
but
that's
certainly
not
anything
they
should
be
complaining
about.
