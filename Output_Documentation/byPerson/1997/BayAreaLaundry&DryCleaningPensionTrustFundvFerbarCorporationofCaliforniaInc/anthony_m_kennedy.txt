does
interest
run
on
withdrawal
liability?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
interest
would
not
run
from
the
date
of
withdrawal.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
in
the
complaint
didn't
you
ask
to
accelerate
the
entire
amount?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
doesn't
that
amount
to
an
election
of
the
option
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--maybe
that's
not
going
to
bar
you
anyway,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
would
the
suit
say
if
the
suit
were
filed
the
day
after
their
withdrawal?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
that
true
100
percent
of
the
time?
does
every
employer
who
withdraws
always
have
to
pay
an
additional
amount?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
because
sometimes
the
fund
is
adequate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
sometimes
it's...
sometimes
the
fund
is
adequate
for
the...
to
pay
the
benefits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
it,
then,
because
when
i
read
the
petitioner's
brief
i
said,
well,
the
closest
analogy
is
a
contract,
and
so
that's...
there's
a
lot
of
merit
to
her
argument.
then
i
looked
at
your
brief
to
see
what
is
the
analogous
cause
of
action,
the
analogous
type
of
wrong
that
you
assert,
and
i
couldn't
find
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
is
it
some
kind
of
breach
of
fiduciary
duty,
or
something
like
that?
i...
no,
that
doesn't
work.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
actually
think
a
demand
note
runs
from
the
time
it's
made,
but
there
are
a
number
of...
not
a
number,
but
there
are
some
instances
where
there
is
a
continuing
wrong,
and
the
statute
of
limitations
is
in
effect
in
the
hands
of
the
plaintiff,
because
the
plaintiff
demands
that
you
cease
the
wrong
and
can
sue
from
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
was
trying
to
think
of
an
instance
in
which
the
statute
of
limitations
is
really
in
the
hands
of
the
plaintiff,
and
that's
what
i
came
up
with.
