so
under
your
view,
i
mean,
there
would
be
a
separate
cause
of
action
for
each
instalment
payment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
means
that
in
theory
it
could
continue
on
for
26
years
or
so.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
suppose
if
there's
an
early
default
the
plan's
sponsor
could
accelerate
the
balance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
under
your
theory
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
case
would
have
started
to
run
6
years
after
the
nonpayment
of
the
first
instalment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
the
whole
thing,
so
it
has
the
result
in
effect
of
accelerating
the
entire
debt,
even
though
there
are
provisions
in
the
statute
that
expressly
say
it
won't
be
accelerated
unless
this
plan's
sponsor
takes
certain
action.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
a
demand
promissory
note.
there's
no
due
date,
and
so
whenever
the
holder
of
the
note
says,
okay,
i
want
payment
now,
in
60
days,
that
triggers
the
running
of
the
statute.
it's
not
a
concept
unknown
in
our
legal
system.
