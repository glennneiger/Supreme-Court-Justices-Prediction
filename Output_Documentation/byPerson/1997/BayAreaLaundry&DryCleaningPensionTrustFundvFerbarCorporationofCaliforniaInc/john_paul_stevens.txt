justice
john
paul
stevens
is...
am
i
correct
in
understanding
that
the
option
that
you
think
is
correct
is
not
any
of
the
four
that
you
listed
in
your
cert
petition,
because
you
said
your...
first
is
the
withdrawal
date,
second
the
date
when
the
payment
becomes
overdue,
you're
not
relying
on
that,
then
for
each
payment
due,
on
the
date
the
payment
becomes
overdue
unless
the
plan's
sponsor
elects
to
evoke
the
statutory
provision
on
acceleration
or
some
other
date,
at
some
other
date
you
think
is
right,
is
when
the
demand--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and...
but
when
does
it
become
overdue,
when
it
was
not
paid,
or
when
you
made
a
further
demand?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
then
you're
not
in
time
for
the
first
payment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
view
of
the
statute
is
it
did
not...
you
could
not
have
sued
on
the
date
it
became
overdue
if
you
didn't...
you
couldn't
have
sued
until
he--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--read
the
demand
letter.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
was
it
not
overdue
on
the
first
date?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
not
overdue
until
60
days
after
the
date
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
was
supposed
to
have
been
made.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
maybe
it
isn't
important
in
this
case,
but
you're
saying
it
is
certainly
in
the
laws
of
some
importance
to
people
who
practice
in
this
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
inquire,
to
be
sure
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
the
provision
on
page
15a,
the
(c)(2)
provision,
that
60
days
in
your
view
merely
sets
an
outer
limit
on
the
time...
on
when
the
payment
can
become
due.
that...
when
the
plan
may
request
payment.
it
must
fix
a
date
within
that
60-day
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
extension
to
26
years
would
be
only
for
the
last
$350.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they've
pretty
well
conceded
that
if
we
don't
read
the
statute
that
one
way
they
lose
the
first
payment.
i
don't
know
why
they
wouldn't
lose
59
payments
if
they
waited
another
appropriate
number
of
59
months.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
they
can,
is
one
of
the...
then
your
26-year
statute
of
limitations
applies
to
only
$350,
not
to
the
entire
amount.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
necessarily
true.
supposing
you
paid
the
full
amount
of
the
withdrawal
liability.
you
would
have
paid
for
all
the
unfunded
liability,
your
share
of
the
unfunded
liability.
withdrawal
doesn't
necessarily
harm
the
plan.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
if
you
promptly
paid
the
assessment,
there
would
have
been
no
harmful
consequences
to
the
plan
from
the
withdrawal.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
delay
during
this
period
is
all
to
the
advantage
of
the
person
who
is
obligated
to
pay.
i
mean,
there's
an
incentive
on
the
part
of
the
trust,
that
if
trustees
are
doing
their
job
they'll
get
moving.
the
longer
they
take,
the
better
off
you
are.
you
get
an
interest-free
loan
for
this
whole
period
of
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
have
a
duty
to
act
as
soon
as
practical,
or
whatever
the
statute
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it's
sort
of
a
strange
way
to
penalize
them
to
say
that
if
you
don't
act
promptly
we'll
let
the
employer...
let
the
contributor
off
the
hook.
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
according
to
the
letter
it
would
have
been
due
before...
they
gave
them...
you
gave
them
up
to
february
10,
60
days
from
december
12.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
in
any
event
you
gave
them
beyond
february
1.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
the...
under
his
reading
and
my
reading
of
that
paragraph
you
lose
the
first
payment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
they
had
no
obligation
to
do
anything--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--because
they
had
an
option
to
pay
in
full
on
february
8,
because
that's
what
you
asked
for.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
have
an
obligation,
they
had
an
option.
they
had
an
option,
because
you
demanded
payment
in
full
within
60
days,
or
if
you
don't
do
it
you
can
pay
monthly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that's
right,
so
you
could
not
have
sued.
