mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
statutory
collection
action,
and
it
may
be
helpful
to
return
for
a
moment
to
the
words
of
the
statute
at
issue,
which
are
reprinted
at
page
17a
of
the
petitioner's
brief.
29
u.s.c.
section
1451(a)(1)
gives
a
cause
of
action
to
a
plan
fiduciary...
i'm
eliding
some
material...
a
plan
fiduciary
who
is
adversely
affected
by
the
act
or
omission
of
any
party
under
this
subtitle
who
may
bring
an
action
for
appropriate
legal
or
equitable
relief.
now,
our
basic
submission,
along
with
that
of
petitioner's,
is
quite
simple,
first,
that
the
only
relevant
adverse
effects
under
the
subtitle,
under
the
statute,
arose
not
from
respondent's
withdrawal
from
the
plan,
but
from
its
failure
to
pay
withdrawal
liability
on
the
schedule
prescribed
by
the
statute.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we...
that
is
a
conceivable
reading
of
that
section
of
the
statute.
we
don't
think
it's
the
best
reading.
we
think
that
the
statutory
section
is
best
read
to
give
that
60
days
as
a
terminus
before
which
the
plan
must
make
the
payment
due,
but
i
think
if
you
look
at
normal
practice,
from
what
i
understand
from
the
pbgc,
and
also
the
reported
cases
make
this
fairly
clear,
the
normal
practice
is
for
plans
to
set
a
date
that
is
within
the
60
days
but
is
not
actually
the
sixty-first
day
from
the
date
of
demand.
and
that
makes
a
lot
of
practical
sense,
because
what
you...
what
the
plan
often
wants
to
do
is
make
the
payment
due
on
the
same
day
that
the
payments
normally
were
due
before
the
withdrawal,
or
on
some
day
that's
convenient
for
accounting
purposes,
as
opposed
to
being
tied
to
a
specific
thirtieth
or
sixtieth
day
from
the
date
of
demand,
which
would
unduly
constrain
either
the
date
you
want
to
send
the
notice
or
the
date
that
you
set
the
payment
to
be
due,
so
we
think
the
best
reading
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we
believe
the
payment
is
due
on
the
day
that
is
specified
in
the
schedule--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
answer
is
that
suit
would
be
timely
if
it
was
before
the
sixty-first
day,
but
after
the
day
that
the
payment
was
due
under
the
schedule.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
no.
the
suit
would
have
to
be
filed
within
6
years
of
the
day
specified
in
the
plan's
schedule
as
the
day
the
first
payment
was
due,
is
our
position,
which
is
not
the
position
the
petitioners
are
taking.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct,
which
is
why
in
our
view
of
the
way
the
statute
is
best
construed
it
is
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
the
question
passed
on
by
the
seventh
circuit,
which
is,
was
there
only
one
cause
of
action
and
therefore
when
the
first
payment
was
missed
was
there
a
sort
of
automatic
acceleration
back
to
that
point,
so
that
if
you
missed
the
first
payment
you
missed
everything.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
it's
perfectly
within
this
court's
options
to
reject
the
rule
that
the
ninth
circuit
came
up
with,
which
was
running
from
the
date
of
withdrawal,
and
to
leave
all
the
other
issues
for
resolution
below.
that
would
not
be
what
we
would
think
was
the
most
appropriate
outcome,
and
we
think
there
are
several
questions
that
are
fairly
presented
and
fairly
subsumed
within
the
question,
and
that
the
court
could
usefully
make
clear
for
the
benefit
of
the
bar,
but
certainly
it
would
be
proper
for
the
court
merely
to
resolve
the
narrow
question
you
suggest.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
correct.
i'm
sorry,
which
60
days,
now,
are
we
talking
about
there?
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
no.
that
is
a
different
60-day
provision--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--which
is
the
60
days--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--we
are
talking
about
1399(c)(2).
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it's...
u.s.
code
is
29
u.s.c.
1399(c)(2),
and
it's
on
page
15a
of
the
petition...
of
the
blue
brief...
which
says
the
withdrawal
liability
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--page
15a.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
(c)(2).
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
withdrawal
liability
is
payable...
this
is
the
actually
payable
part...
in
accordance
with
the
schedule
set
forth
by
the
plan,
beginning
no
later
than
60
days
after
the
date
of
the
demand,
notwithstanding
any
request
for
review
or
appeal.
this
is
part
of
what
goes
into
the
pay-now-dispute-later
feature
of
the
statute,
which
we
think
is
quite
important.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
60
days
that
i
believe
you
were
referring
to--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--is
the
60
days
that
is
incorporated
in
the
definition
of
default,
which
is
on
the
next
page,
page
16a,
really
carrying
over
from
15a,
that
default
means
failure
of
an
employer
to
make,
when
due,
any
payment
if
the
failure
is
not
cured
within
60
days,
and
our
submission
there,
which
is
fairly
important,
is
that
that
default...
the
definition
of
default
is
relevant
for
only
one
thing,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
the
plan
is
entitled
under
the
statute
to
accelerate
the
entire
remaining
unpaid
liability.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
and
that
is
quite
different
from
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
payment
or
set
of
payments
are
overdue.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
right.
a
missing
of
the
first
payment,
yes,
is
exactly
right.
it's
an
overdue...
it's
a
delinquency
rather
than
a
default.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
one
on
15a----
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--(c)(2).
that's
right.
it
only...
our
position
is,
it's
for
the
protection
of
the
beneficiaries,
essentially.
it
allows
the
plan
some
flexibility
in
setting
the
beginning
of
the
schedule,
but
it
sets
an
outer
limit
past
which
they
may
not
go.
they
must
make
the
first
payment
due
within
that
first
60
days,
so
it's
really
not
for
the
protection
of
employers
at
all.
it's
for
the
protection
of
the
beneficiaries.
really,
in
sum
we
have
only
four
points
to
make,
first
that
accrual,
as
is
the
general
rule
everywhere,
follows
the
right
to
sue,
and
here
the
right
to
sue
under
the
statute
arises
not
from
withdrawal,
as
the
ninth
circuit
held,
but
from
the
failure
to
make
a
statutory
payment
when
due
under
the
statute,
and
that's
the
only
thing
the
plan
could
ever
have
sued
for,
and
that's
all
they
sued
for
here.
the
further
consequences
of
that
we
think
follow
from
a
routine
application
of
principles
of...
general
principles
of
law
under
the
statutes
of
limitations
and
acceleration
law,
and
all
of
these
rules
i
think
importantly
work
together
to
support
congress'
fundamental
purpose
here
in
this
entire
scheme,
which
is
to
protect
beneficiaries
of
these
plans
by
strengthening
and
stabilizing
the
multiemployer
pension
plan
system
by
ensuring,
to
the
extent
possible,
a
steady
flow
of
even
payments
on
which
the
plan
can
count,
and
with
full
provision
for
protecting
the
employer
after
an
arbitration
and
after
any
determination
of
defenses
on
the
merits
by
making
a
refund
available.
all
we
are
talking
about
here
is
interim
payments
while
a
dispute
on
the
merits
goes
forward.
the
statute
makes
quite
clear
that
those
are
due
and
payable
now,
and
this
action
is
timely
to
collect
them.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
when
i
speak
of
a
dispute
on
the
merits,
i
refer
to
a
dispute
before
the
arbitrator.
it
is
true
that
in
the
complaint,
as
a
response
to
the
complaint
in
this
case,
the
employer
raised
an
affirmative
defense
that
there
had
been
a
failure
to
respond
to
the
request
for
arbitration,
and
we
think
that
is
not
well-taken,
but
certainly
the
court
on
remand
could
consider
that.
we
think
the
right
result
would
be
for
it
to
go
to
arbitration
and
have
all
of
the
employer's
objections
to
any
particulars
of
the
assessment
here
handled
in
arbitration
between
the
parties.
