unknown
speaker
that
isn't
precisely
the
two
questions
in
your
petition,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
second
question
in
your
petition
you
see
as
basically
should
the
court
of
appeals
have
affirmed
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
what
do
you
mean
by
permit
pervasiveness?
unknown
speaker
so
pervasiveness
means
multiple
victims,
then?
unknown
speaker
secret
pervasiveness.
that's--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
know
how...
i
mean,
constructive
notice,
i
can't
imagine
how
secret
pervasiveness
could
ever...
could
ever
give
rise
to
constructive
notice.
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
you're
saying
that
it
was
so
obvious
that
the
employer
must
have
known
about
it?
unknown
speaker
the
employer
is
downtown,
in...
in
city
hall.
and
all
of
this
is
going
on
across
the
highway,
on
the
beach.
now,
is...
is
it
implausible
that
he
would
know
about
it...
that...
that
the
employer
would
not
know
about
it?
unknown
speaker
he
wasn't
asked
to
do
so.
i
thought
he
was
asked
as
a
friend.
he
was
told
as
a
friend,
and
asked
what
he
though,
as
a
friend.
isn't
that
what
it
seemed
from
the
testimony?
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
about
the
third...
what
you
list
under
"c".
suppose
the
city
had
had
just
a
fine
policy
against
this
kind
of
conduct.
and
it
was
included
in
the
manual
that
every
employee
got.
and
it
had
the
telephone
number
in
city
hall
to
call
when
incidents
like
this
came
up.
and
everything
else
is
the
same.
would
there
be
title
vii
liability
for...
what
was
it...
silverman
and
terry's
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
city?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
you
make...
you
seem
to
make
quite
a
thing
out
of
this...
there
was
no
procedure
that
was...
that
was
well
known.
but
now
you
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
that...
that
sounds
like
strict
liability
to
me.
that
sounds
like
strict
liability.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i...
i
inferred
from
your
remarks...
maybe
improperly
so...
that
the...
they
were
aided,
under
the
219(d)
formulation
because
of
the
subordinate/superior
relation.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
strict
liability.
unknown
speaker
that's
strict
liability
whenever
there
is
a...
a
superior
that
harasses
a
subordinate.
unknown
speaker
well,
could
you
give
us
some
examples
of
situations
in
which
the
employer
would
not
be
liable
under
your
hypothesis?
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
just
informed
justice
ginsburg
that
if
the
employer
had
had
a
strong
policy,
fully
communicated,
that
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
now,
what
position
are
you
taking?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg
was
incorrect...
it
would
make
a
difference
if
the
employer
had
a
policy--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
would
be
an
excuse,
so
there
would
not
be
strict
liability?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
example
of
when
an
employer
would
not
be
liable.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
because
he's
not
a
direct
supervisor,
presumably.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
justice
o'connor
was
asking
for
an
example
where
there
was
a
direct
supervisor
who
would
not
be
liable.
exactly.
unknown
speaker
you
would
at
least
say
that
all
of
these
cases
have
to
go
to
trial?
unknown
speaker
you
would
never
be
able
to
get...
to
get
these
cases
disposed
of
before
a
full
fledged
trial--
unknown
speaker
--as
to
whether...
whether
the
woman
had
a,
quote,
reasonable
fear?
unknown
speaker
well,
when...
when
would
it
be,
if
all
the
woman
has
to
do
is
say,
i
had
a
reasonable
fear?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
company
could
have
the
clearest
policy,
and...
and
many
other
employees
could
have...
could
have
used
that
policy
to
stop
this
kind
of
intimidation.
but
if
a
particular
woman
has
not
used
it,
she
could
still
have
a
trial
on...
on
whether
she
was
fearful
enough...
that...
that's
an
excuse?
unknown
speaker
well,
incidentally,
reasonable
fear
of
what
ridicule,
retaliation,
embarrassment?
because
i...
i
assume
some
of
those
will
always
be
present.
unknown
speaker
okay,
retaliation.
unknown
speaker
that...
that
is
to
say,
demotion
and
further
bad
treatment,
et
cetera?
unknown
speaker
it's
just
women?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
just
sexual
harassment?
i
mean,
do
you
know
anybody
who
isn't...
who
isn't
afraid
of...
of,
you
know,
criticizing
his
supervisor?
unknown
speaker
jumping
over
the
chain
of
command,
and
crit...
nobody
is
not
afraid
of
that,
is
he?
unknown
speaker
and
that's...
that's
why
there's
an
absolute
liability.
yes.
there's
always
going
to
be
reasonable
fear.
and,
therefore,
there's
always
going
to
be
absolute
liability.
unknown
speaker
but
let's
go
back
to
what
you
conceded,
at
least
i
thought.
there's
a
very
clear
policy.
it
has
been
used
successfully...
the
third
circuit
case.
so
that
could
go
to
summary
judgment,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
said--
unknown
speaker
--you
said
it
could
be
mitigating,
and
it...
i'm
sort
of
fuzzy
about...
you
give...
on
the
one
hand,
you
give
have
a
clear
policy,
great
prominence;
but
then
it
kind
of
drifts
off
into
the
wind.
unknown
speaker
i
really
gave
you
an
example
of
a
policy
that's
included
in
the
manual.
let's
have
it
posted
on
the
guardhouse
door.
everyone
knows
about
it,
and
there's
a
number,
in
big
letters,
to
call.
and
i
asked
you...
and
everything
else
is
the...
the
same.
these
supervisors
are
just
as
gross.
would
there
be
a
title
vii
claim
against
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
this
is
an
objective
fear
or
subjective?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
amlong.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
now,
you...
you
would
say
that,
and
that
alone,
is...
is
sufficient
to
impose
liability?
unknown
speaker
you
don't...
this
is
not
a
negligence
argument?
you're
not--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
is
negligence?
unknown
speaker
is
it
a
negligence
standard?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a...
it's
a
negligence...
it's
a
negligence
standard
that
will
always
be
satisfied
if
there
is
no
policy?
unknown
speaker
so,
in
effect,
it's
kind
of
an...
an
absolute
policy
standard?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
a
causation
issue...
well,
a
causation
issue
on
the
first
theory,
too,
then?
unknown
speaker
you
say
they
made
it
possible
because--
unknown
speaker
--how
will...
how
will
we
ever
know
that
if
they
haven't
distributed
a
policy?
because
we'll
never
know
how
the...
the...
the
policy,
contrary
to
fact,
would
have
worked.
unknown
speaker
so
won't...
won't
the
effect
of
your
third
prong
always
be
liability
when
there's
no
policy?
unknown
speaker
and
who
is
it
going
to
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's...
if
that's
the
case,
and...
and
what
we're
uncertain
about
is
how
a
policy
that
was
never
promulgated
would
have
worked
in
fact,
then
the
practical
effect
of
the
third
prong
is
always
to
make
the
employer
liable
if
there's
no
policy.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
how
can
you
ever
do
it?
unknown
speaker
that
sounds
like
running
around
robin
hood's
barn.
i
mean,
we're
looking
for
something
that's
fairly
simple
and
easy
to
administer.
and
that
isn't
it.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
need...
why
do
you
need
a
special
policy?
i
mean,
isn't
it...
do
you
really
have
to
tell
somebody
that
if
your
supervisor
is
doing
something
that
you
think
is
wrong
or
improper,
you
should
talk
to
your
supervisor's
supervisor?
why
do
you
need
a
policy
for
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
don't
you
think
every
employee
in
the
country
knows
that
if
they're
mistreated,
they
can
complain
to
somebody
higher
up
the
ladder?
i
mean,
it's
not
like
everybody
is
totally
ignorant
of
these
situations.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
obviously
helpful
to
have.
but
i
think
we
have
a
case
here
that
requires
us
to
grapple
with
a
situation
where
there
wasn't
an
articulated
policy.
and
we're
trying
to
look
at
what
reasonable
people
know
and
understand.
and
i
would
have
thought
most
people
would
know
and
understand
that
if
you're
being
mistreated,
you
can
complain
to
a
higher
up.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
that's
a
form
of
strict
liability,
it
seems
to
me.
because
i
think
any
employee
is
going
to
fear
adverse
consequences
from...
from
a
supervisor,
even
though
the
supervisor...
the
harassing
supervisor
has
not
made
any
threat
at
all,
just
by
virtue
of
the
position.
that's
why
you
laugh
at
his
jokes.
i
mean,
everybody
knows
that.
that...
that's
a--
unknown
speaker
--what
would
you
do
if
you
have
the
model
employer,
who
does
everything
that
they
can,
but
he...
there
is
one
bad
apple,
a
supervisor,
and
he
offers
a
quid
pro
quo...
promotion
in
exchange
for
sexual
favors,
et
cetera...
is
that
a
completely
different
case,
or
is
it
governed
by
this
same
rule?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
woman
is
not...
is
not
fired,
because...
because
she...
she
yields
to
the...
to
the
harassment,
and
provides
the
sexual
favor
requested?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
now,
i...
i
find
that...
why
is
that?
that
seems
to
me
very
strange.
i
mean,
so
it
would
make
all
the
difference
in
this
case...
let's
assume...
let's
assume
that...
that...
that
there
would
otherwise
be
liability
on
the
basis
of
employer
negligence
only.
let's
assume
we
were
to
adopt
that
rule.
unknown
speaker
you
say,
however,
that
if
in
this
case
one
of
the
lifeguards
had
said,
you
know,
unless
you
let
me
continue
to
abuse
you
in
this
fashion,
i'm
going
to
assign
you
to
that
tower,
that
life
tower...
lifesaving
tower
that
doesn't
have
a
screen
on
it--
unknown
speaker
--that
would
be
quid
pro
quo,
i
guess,
right?
unknown
speaker
and
suddenly
everything
would
transform,
even
though
the
employer
knows
nothing
about
it.
all
you
have
to
allege
is
that
he
said
he
was
going
to
send
me
to
this
other
tower.
and
suddenly
it
becomes
a
totally
different
case.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
why.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
because
it's
a
little
difficult
to
see
where
the
line
is
between
that
kind
of
case
and
this
kind
of
case.
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
to
go
off
to
the
tower
without
any
windows;
it's...
is
it
so
different
to
be
subjected
to
this
kind
of
leering
and
groping
and
foul
mouth
every
day?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
in...
in
situations
where
the
harassment
is
carried
out
by
the
supervisor,
but
there
is
no
retaliation
suggested
or
in
fact
imposed
by
the
supervisor,
he
just
does
these
gross
things,
but
otherwise
the...
the
employment
relationship
stays
the
same,
why
do
you
say
the
employer
has
aided
the
supervisor
in
doing
it?
why
isn't
it
closer
to
the
co
employee
harassment
situation?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
rissetto,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is...
is
firing
someone
just
because
of
the
color
of
his
skin,
when
the
employer
has
a...
a
policy
against
race
discrimination,
is
that
within
the
scope
of
employment?
unknown
speaker
you...
you
had
said
that
this
kind
of
thing
can't
be
within
the
scope
of
employment
because
no
rational
employer
would
sanction...
would
allow
such
a
thing.
and
i
said,
well,
suppose
you
have
a
bigot
running
the
personnel
office
and
the
employer
doesn't
know
about
it.
and
that
that
person
is
making
decisions
strictly
on
the
basis
of
race.
surely,
not
within
the
scope
of
employment
anymore.
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
as
far
as
attributing
it
to
the
employer,
the
employer
in
both
cases
says
that's
certainly
not
any
policy
that
i
authorized.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand--
--but
it
isn't
because...
because,
i
think,
as...
as
your...
your...
your
friend
on
the
other
side
indicated,
it's
still
a
quid
pro
quo.
even
if
the
person
is
not
fired,
but...
but
yields
and...
and...
and
gives
the
sexual
favor
demanded,
isn't
that
still
quid
pro
quo?
unknown
speaker
so
you
think
that...
that
should
make
the
difference,
the...
the...
the
woman
who
is
so
intimidated
that
she
yields
is...
does
not
get
the
advantage
of
the
quid
pro
quo
rule,
whereas
the
one
who...
who
is
tougher
and
is
fired
does?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
not
arguing
that
there
should
be
a
negligence
test
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
rissetto,
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
you
draw
the
distinction
because
the
personnel
supervisor,
in
the
course
of
his
or
her
regular
responsibilities,
hires
and
fires
people.
that's...
but
why
isn't
it
true
that
the
supervisor
in
this
case,
in
the
course
of
his
regular
responsibilities,
is
responsible
for
the
conduct
that
occurs
at
the
beach?
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
including
how
the
employees
deal
with
one
another.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
didn't
the
personnel
officer
depart
from
the
scope
when
he
based
it
on
race
rather
than
merit?
unknown
speaker
well,
here,
this
supervisor
made
a...
a...
employment
decision
in
the
sense
it
related
to
how
people
had
to
interact
with
one
another
under
his
supervision.
why
isn't
that
an
employment
decision?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
why
is
it
a
fundamental
distinction?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
follow.
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
why
is
it
a
fundamental
distinction?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
follow.
unknown
speaker
because
in
both
cases,
the...
the
supervisor
is
performing
his...
his
or
her
general
official
responsibilities,
but
deviates
from
company
policy.
and
you
say,
in
one
deviation,
is
outside
the
scope
of
the
employment,
but
the
other
is
not.
unknown
speaker
but
so
is
the
right
to
tell
how
people
behave
on
the
beach.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
think
of
the
situation
where
the
employer
tells
the
supervisor
to
run
an
errand,
drive
the
car
downtown
to
buy
supplies
for
the
beach.
and
on
the
way,
the
employ...
the
supervisor
drives
negligently
and
hits
somebody.
employer
liable?
sure.
not
a
frolic
of
his
own.
unknown
speaker
so...
so
how
do
you
relate
what
happened
here
to
that
concept?
unknown
speaker
well,
his
responsibilities
included
supervising
the
employees.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
he
carried
it
out
in
a
grossly
improper
fashion.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
think
you're--
--would
it
make
a
difference
if...
if
one
of
the
other...
or
both
of
them...
said,
i'm
going
to
have
my
way
with
you
once
a
week,
and
everything
else
is
the
same,
would
the
employer
be
reachable
more
readily
than
you
contend,
where
there
was
just
groping
and
leering
and
foul
language?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
don't
we
just
concentrate
on
the
act
rather
than...
he
doesn't
say,
i'm
going
to
fire
you.
he's
going
to
say,
you're
here,
i'm
stronger,
once
a
week.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
that...
if
that
were
a
term
and
condition
of
her
employment
imposed
by
the
supervisor,
there
would
still
be
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
words,
because
there
were
deeds
here,
too.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
go
that
far.
so
let's
take
this
case,
where
there's
no
words,
just
deeds.
that
happens
once
a
week.
and
it's
a...
she
describes
it
as
a
term
or
condition...
a
condition
of
her
employment.
would
it
not
be,
if
that
in
fact
is
what
her
boss...
her
supervisor
did?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the
problem.
is
it
or
is
it
not?
how
do
i
know?
or
i
know
the
fact
that
once
a
week
this
goes
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
trying
to
find
out,
as
far
as
the
employer's
liability
is
concerned,
which
is
the
issue
before
us,
whether
these
are
differences
in
degrees
or
difference
in
kind,
whether
it
makes
any
difference.
unknown
speaker
well...
well,
i'm
not
so
sure.
in
the
case
of
very
gross
misconduct
of
the
kind
in
the
hypothetical,
in
one
sense,
the
employee
is...
almost
has
less
fear
because
she
knows
the
employer
will
stop
that.
it's
these...
it's
these
less
offensive,
but
still
gross
and
vulgar,
situations,
where
she
is
really
concerned
that
the
employer
might
brush
her
off
or
not...
not
care,
not
act.
unknown
speaker
what
is
subtle
about
the
behavior
that's
described
here?
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
nothing
here,
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
that
was
secret.
it
was
on
the
beach,
right?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
nub
of
your
argument,
that
it
is...
that
it
is
more
difficult
for
the
employer
to...
to
become
aware
of
this
kind
of
harassment
than
it
is
for
the
employer
to
become
aware
of
racially
discriminatory
hiring?
is
that
the
nub
of
it?
is
that
why
you...
you
would...
you
would
call
for
different
treatment
of
employer
liability
in
those
two
cases?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
other...
what's
the
other
part?
unknown
speaker
no.
but
that's
just
a
matter
of
definition.
i
mean,
what
you're
saying
is
the
person
in
your
example,
who...
who
fires
or
hires
for
a
racially
discriminatory
purpose,
is
exercising
a
power
that
the
employer
has...
has
given
him.
but
you
could
just
as
well
define
it
by
saying
no,
the
employer
has
simply
given
an
authority
to
hire
and
fire
for
legitimate
reasons.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that
distinction,
which
you've
stated
several
times,
is
simply
a
distinction
that's
based
on
an
arbitrary
definition
that...
that
you
are
assuming
here.
and
the
real
reason,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
is
that
it's
more
difficult
for
the
employer
to
become
aware
of
the
harassment
than
to
become
aware
of
the
racial
discrimination.
and
you...
you
said
a
second
ago
that
that
is
one
of
your
reasons.
my
question
is
why
is
it
more
difficult?
all
sorts
of
hiring
decisions
are
made.
and
they
may...
they
may
be
made
very
legitimately,
even
though
the...
the
two
parties,
the...
the
supervisor
and
the
person
hired
or
fired
are
of
different
races.
how
is
it
easier
for
the
employer
in
the
racial
situation
to
know
that
something
wrong
is
going
on,
but
not
in
the
harassment
situation?
unknown
speaker
why
is
the
situation
any
different
when
we
get
to
sex
harassment?
unknown
speaker
no.
but
you're
saying...
your
response
to
my
definitional
objection
was,
in
effect,
it's...
it's
easier
to
define
with
reference
to
the
prohibited
act
in
the
one
case
than
in
the
other.
and...
and
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
i
don't...
i
don't
understand
why
the
definitional
responsibility
and
the
practical
consequences
of
it
are
different
in
the
race
situation
from
the
sex
situation.
unknown
speaker
okay.
and
that's
true
with
respect
to
improper
racial
considerations.
it's
true
with
respect
to
improper
sex
considerations.
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
if...
if...
if
ibm
refuses
to
hire
a
woman,
and
thereby
violates
the
prohibition
against
discrimination
based
on
sex,
you
don't
need
vicarious
liability
on
the
part
of
a
supervisor
or
on
the
part
of
the
hiring
manager.
she
tried
to
get
on
ibm's
payroll
and
did
not
succeed.
so
it
seems
to
me
you're
not
talking
about
vicarious
liability
there
at
all.
you're
talking
about
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer
directly.
unknown
speaker
suppose...
suppose
i...
i'm
a
hiring
officer
for
a
company,
and
i
hire
somebody
because
he's
my
son
in
law.
am
i
acting--
unknown
speaker
--am
i...
am
i
acting
in
the
scope
of
my
employment?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no.
apart
from
whether...
there's
no
discrimination.
there's
no
title
vii
involved.
unknown
speaker
i'm
clearly
not
acting
in
the
scope
of
my
employment
if
the
only
reason
i
hired
a
person
is
because
he's
my
son
in
law.
unknown
speaker
he's
incompetent.
yes.
but
he's
making
hiring
decisions.
i
don't
care
if
he's
qualified.
[laughter]
i
don't
care
whether
he's
qualified;
he's
my
son
in
law.
i
mean--
what's
family
for?
right.
unknown
speaker
i,
m--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
another--
unknown
speaker
--if
you
could
get
away
from
the
hiring
for
a
second.
supposing
a...
a
company...
the
supervisor
has
a...
the
work
place
has
got
asbestos
in
it
or
it's
dirty
or
unhealthy
or
something
like
that.
and
it
makes
it
an
undesirable
place
in
which
to
work,
which
causes
harm
to
the
employee.
should
there
be
a
different
standard
of
liability
on
the...
on
the
principle
there
than
in...
in
this
particular
work
environment
situation?
unknown
speaker
but
why
is
it
different
in
that?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
was...
it
wasn't...
it
was
not
within
the
public
health
exception,
but
just
a
general
dirty
place,
and
squalid...
i
suppose
most
of
these
do
come
down
to
health,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it's
some...
if
it's
just
simply
unpleasant,
you'd
say
you
would
not...
you
would
not
attribute
it
to
the
employer
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
unless
which
actually
caused
harm.
but,
again,
you're...
you're
in
the
health
area.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is
the
public
interest
in
avoiding
this
kind
of
environment
is
not
as
strong
as
the
public
interest
in
protecting
the
health
of
the
worker?
unknown
speaker
sure.
but
what
is
the
interest
different
here
from
the
interest
in
the
race
situation
or
the
interest
in
the
health
situation?
why
is
it
lesser?
that's...
because
i
think
that's
what
you're...
at
the
moment,
i
think
that's
what
you're
telling
us
we
should
find.
and
what
are
the
reasons
for
finding
it?
unknown
speaker
so
the
standards
are
to
be
the
same?
unknown
speaker
then
why
don't
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
why
is
the...
why
is
the
necessity
different
between
a
hostile
environment
situation
in
sex
and
a
hiring/firing
decision
on
race?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but
why?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
it's
not
vicarious
liability
in
the
one
case
but
it
is
vicarious
liability
in
the
other
case?
the
president
of
ibm
does
not
know
when
the
personnel
manager
in
pasadena,
california
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
race
any
more
than
he
knows
that
a
supervisor
is
creating
or
tolerating
a
hostile
environment
based
on
sex...
doesn't
know
in
either
case.
why
is
the
treatment
different?
unknown
speaker
may...
may
i
be
sure
i
understood
your
answer
to
the
comparative,
two
different
kinds
of
hostile
environment,
one
caused
by
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here,
and
the
other
caused
by
a
supervisor
who
doesn't
like
african
americans
and
he
puts
them
all
in
the
corner.
you
say
the
same
standard
of...
of
agency
liability
would
apply
to
both
of
those
cases?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
have
we
ever--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
company
has
a
policy
in
both
cases
against
sexual
harassment
on
the
one
kind,
and
against
treating
blacks
differently
than
whites.
but
the
supervisor
happens
to
be
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan
in
one
case,
and
he
happens
to
be
the
lifeguard
in
this
case.
are
they
parallel,
in
terms
of
agency
principles?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
supervisor
does
it.
the
people
in
city
hall
don't
know
about
it
in
either
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
same
is
true
of
my...
the
same
is
true
of
my...
my
black/white
case,
too.
unknown
speaker
yes,
they
would
be
parallel.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no,
not
a
gratuitous
comment.
a
steady,
every
day
policy
of
making
the
black
secretary
sit
off
in
a
dark
corner.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
if
you
say
liable
in
both
cases...
but
you're
saying
in
this
case
your
client
is
not
liable.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
suppose...
so
you'd
say,
in
my
case,
if
the
hostile
environment
for
the
black
secretary
was
partly
the
assignment,
but
consisted
mostly
of
racial
epithets
and
the
like,
then
it
would
be
the
same
case?
unknown
speaker
okay.
can...
can
you
say
what...
what
harm
do
you
do
to
the
fabric
of
the
law...
and
i'm
not
saying
you
don't...
but
what
harm
do
you
do
if
you
say
the...
the
policing
of
the
environment,
the
policing
of
the
work
environment
for
a
high
level
supervisor,
is
precisely
analogous
to
hiring
and
firing
in
respect
to
a
hirer?
and
if
you
do
the
hiring
wrong,
even
for
personal
motives,
the
company
is
liable
because
the
hiring/firing
decision
is
the
company.
and
if
you
do
the
policing
of
the
environment
wrong,
your
company
is
liable,
because
the
policing
of
the
environment
is
a
company
responsibility.
i
think
that's
what
justice
stevens
and
everybody
has
been
trying
to
get
at...
i
think.
and...
and
you're
saying,
well,
that
would
be
somewhat
novel.
but
there
is
an
analogy,
i
take
it,
in
the
asbestos
area.
and
is
there
other
harm
that
would
be
occurring
if...
if...
i
mean,
is...
would
the
law
be
hurt?
is
that
very
novel?
is
it
contrary
to
other?
you
see
what
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
get
a--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
because
of
your
policy
argument.
and
i've
been
think...
in
my...
my...
the
reaction
that
i
wanted
to
ask
you
about
that
is,
is
that...
in
other
words,
the
difficulty
of
the
employer
finding
out...
is
that
a
problem
with
the
liability
assessment?
or
is
it
a
problem
with
the
substantive
standard?
unknown
speaker
that
is,
if
you
have
a
tough
substantive
standard,
you
risk,
let's
say,
creating
too
much
tension
in
the
work
place.
if
you
have
too
relaxed
a
standard,
you
risk
injuring
women
or
minorities
in
the
work
place.
it's
very
hard
to
get
the
right
standard.
but
is
the
policy
problem
that
you're
worried
about
related
to
the
standard
or
is
it
related
to
this
problem
of
liability?
that's
my
whole
question.
unknown
speaker
then
you
sue
and
you
recover
$1.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
that's
what
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
we
are
going
to
have
to
address
at...
i
think,
at
some
point
in
this
case,
the
constructive
notice
by
reason
of...
of
gordon's
involvement,
and
by
his
failure
to
report.
could
you
just
comment
on
your
friend's
argument
in
that
respect?
unknown
speaker
is...
is
one
standard
whether
or
not
he
would
have
been
disciplined
for
failure
to
make
the
report?
unknown
speaker
it
seem...
it
seemed
to
me
that
the...
the
counsel,
in
the
petitioner's
brief,
made
the
point,
if
he
had...
if
gordon
had
known
that...
i
think
terry...
was
stealing
money,
i
assume
he
probably
would
have
been
disciplined
by
the
city
for
failure
to
report
that.
maybe
i'm
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
i...
suppose
i
knew
that
gordon
would
be
disciplined
for
failure
to
report
theft
by
terry,
even
though
gordon
is
not
terry's
supervisor.
unknown
speaker
would
that
mean
that
he
should
also
report
this?
or
is
there...
does
he
have
a
different
obligation?
unknown
speaker
so
if
he
has
the
obligation
to
report
theft,
he'd
also
have
the
obligation
to
report
sexual
harassment?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
are
the
duties
of
supervisors?
i...
i
would
have
thought
that
every
employee
has
the
duty
to...
to...
if
he's
a
loyal
employee...
to
tell
his
employer
about...
about
violations
of
law
that
are
occurring.
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
mr.
bender...
wasn't
he
the
witness
who
admitted
that
gordon
had
an
obligation
to
report
this?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rissetto,
what
difference
does
it
make
in
your
view,
legally,
whether
the
employer
has
a
clear
policy
about
sexual
harassment
and
where
to
complain
and
so
on,
or
the
lack
thereof?
how
does
that
fit
in
with
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
today,
if
an
employer
has
such
a
policy,
then...
then
is
the
employer
protected
or
not?
unknown
speaker
how
does
it--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
rissetto.
mr.
amlong,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
was,
even
if
there
was
a
policy,
it
would
make
no
difference;
there
would
still
be
a
trial.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
brother...
your
brother
says
there
would
be
no
liability
there.
he...
i
mean,
he's
drawing
the
distinction,
if
i
understand
it,
between
the
hiring/firing
distinction,
because
supervisors,
at
least,
are
authorized
to
hire
and
fire,
and
the
discrimination,
or
the
harassment
situation,
in
which
they
are
not
authorized
to
harass.
and
he
says
a...
a
definition
of
what
is
or
is
not
within
the
scope
of
employment
is...
is...
is
subject
to
legitimate
distinctions
between
those
two
cases.
what...
what
do
you
think
of
that
distinction?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
claim
that
it's
harder
to
find
out...
it's
harder
for
the
upper
level
employees,
the
management,
to
find
out
about
hostile
environments
than
it
is
for
them
to
find
out
about
discriminatory
hiring
and
firing?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
that's
a
different...
that's
a
different
argument.
