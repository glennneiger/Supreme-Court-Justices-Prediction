mr.
william
r.
amlong
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
is
an
employment
discrimination
case
in
which
there
are
two
issues
facing
the
court.
the
first
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
applied
too
narrow
a
standard
in
the
application
of
agency
principles
to
supervisory
liability
under
title
vii
for
sexual
harassment.
the
second
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
reversing
the
findings
of
the
district
court,
who
had
found
constructive
and
actual
knowledge
by
an
agent
of
the
city,
robert
gordon,
and
had
also
imputed
constructive
knowledge
to
the
city
through
the
pervasiveness
of
the
sexual
harassment
in
this
case.
the
relief
that
we
ask--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--no,
your
honor.
it's
phrased
somewhat
differently.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
based
on
the
factors
i
set
forth
in
the
petition,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
was
the
pervasiveness
that
could
give
rise
to
constructive
knowledge,
and
it
should
be
re...
clearly
erroneous
standard,
that
there
was
notice
to
an
intermediate
agent,
mr.
gordon,
and
that
there
was
no
dissemination
of
the
sexual
harassment
policy.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
i
mean,
by
pervasiveness,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
there
were
eight
women
who
were
sexually
harassed
by
mr.
terry
and/or
mr.
silverman
over
a
period
of
4
years.
that's
what
the
record
evidence
showed.
and
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
pervasiveness
can
have
more
than
one
meaning.
but
in
this
case,
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
pervasiveness
in
the
sense
of
harris
v.
forklift
systems,
could
mean
one
person
with...
kind
of
be
secret
pervasiveness
without--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--a
pervasiveness...
a
pervasiveness,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
would
apply
only
to
that
person.
in
this
case,
the
pervasiveness
is
not
only
as
to
beth
ann
faragher,
the
petitioner,
who
was
repeatedly
and
consistently
sexually
harassed,
but
was
also
to
seven
other
women.
now,
it
is
that
pervasiveness,
your
honor,
that
i
argue
gives
rise
to
constructive
notice.
it
is
that
pervasiveness,
your
honor,
that
differs
from
the
pervasiveness
in
harris.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
nor
can
i.--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--either
must
have
known
about
it
or
was
engaged
in
willful
ignorance
about
it.
did
not
wish
to
know
about
it.
you
can't
sexually
harass
eight
women
over
a
4-year
period
and
not
expect
the
employer
to
know
about
it.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
not
at
all,
your
honor.
because,
justice
scalia,
number
one,
the
beach
is
1.5
miles
from
city
hall,
roughly
the
distance
from
this
court
to
the
washington
monument.
number
two,
corporations
throughout
this
nation
have
offices...
ibm,
for
example,
has
offices
throughout
the
nation,
headquartered
in
new
york.
you
can't
say
that
if
there
was
sexual
harassment
going
on
in
the
ibm
plant
in
boca
raton,
that
ibm
should
not
be
responsible
for
it.
here,
they
were
not...
here,
they
did
not
know
about
it
because
of
two
things.
number
one,
robert
gordon,
who
was
a
captain,
an
intermediate
supervisor
and
someone
who
should
be
expected
to
have
carried
the
message
forward
to
city
hall,
declined
to
do
so
when
he
was
told
by--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
what
is
in
the
testimony
is
that
they
did...
and
what
the
trial
judge
found...
is
that
they
did
find...
that
they
did
hold
mr.
gordon
in
very
high
repute.
and
that's
why
they
came
to
him.
mr.
gordon
testified,
however,
that
nancy
ewanchew,
a
coplaintiff
below,
had
asked
him
repeatedly,
what
can
you
do
about
this?
can
you
make
this
stop?
other
women
had
complained
to
him.
did
they
complain
to
him
as
a
friend?
yes.
did
that
take
away
his
status
as
an
agent
of
the
city?
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
there
would
be.
and
that
goes
to
the
second
ground
on
which
we
seek
to
hold
the
city
liable.
which
is
the
invocation
of
the
kind
of
agency
principles
that
are
embodied
in
the
second
clause--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--no,
your
honor.
it
does
make
a
difference.
because
what
we
are
asking
in
the
219(2)(d)
argument
that
we're
making
is...
and
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
to
impose
liability
on
the
city
in
those
circumstances,
that...
under
219(2)(d)...
that
mr.
gordon...
i'm
sorry...
mr.
silverman
and
mr.
terry
would
have
had
to
explicitly
threatened
ms.
faragher
or
to
actually
used
their
power
to
harm.
what
we
are
arguing,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
the
dynamic
of
a
supervisor/subordinate
relationship
gives
rise
to
a
reasonable
fear
of
retaliation,
so
that
these
women
will
put
up
with
this
stuff.
now,
the
city--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect.
i
believe
it
would
be
strict
liability,
mr.
chief
justice
and
justice
kennedy,
if
we
argued,
perhaps,
under
219(1),
that
they
were
doing
this
in
the
course
of
their
employment.
what
we're
saying
is
that
there
is
liability
when
they
are
aided
in
the
commission
of
the
tortious
behavior.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
no,
it's
not,
your
honor,
respectfully.
strict
liability
is--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--strict
liability,
justice
kennedy,
is
in
such
instances
as
somebody
convicted
of
shooting
birds
over
a
baited
field,
somebody
who
is
shown
to
have
made
a
profit
on
insider
trading,
in...
in
short
swing
investments
under
16(b)
of
the
securities
act
of
1934.
here--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--yes,
i
can,
justice
o'connor.
yes,
i
can.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
yes.
one
example,
for
example,
was
in
the
bouton
v.
bmw
of
north
america
case,
out
of
the
third
circuit,
where
the...
where
the
company
had
a
strong
policy
against
sexual
harassment,
communicated
it
broadly,
that
the
plaintiff
had
herself
used
before.
what
we're
asking--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--i
am
taking
the
position,
your
honor,
that,
number
one,
in
this
case,
there
was
no
policy.
number
two,
that
the
existence
of
a
policy
is
a
strong
mitigating
factor
against
imposing
liability.
but
that,
number
three--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--oh,
it
would
certainly--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--it
would
certainly
make
a
difference.
and
it
would
be
one
of
those
things
to
be
weighed.
because
the
plaintiff
would
have
the
burden
of
proof,
to
prove
that
the
fear
that
she
was
expressing
was
a
reasonable
fear.
what
we
seek
is--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
there
is.
for
example,
if
a
female
police
officer,
on
the
midnight
shift,
complained
about
harassment
by
a
sergeant
on
the
afternoon
shift,
he
would
not
be
responsible
then.
if
a--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
mr.
chief
justice,
the...
we
can't
envision
every
case.
the
bouton
case
was
one
in
which
there
was
a
policy
that
was
disseminated
and
had
been
used.
you're
going
to
have...
the--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--yes.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
justice--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
want
to
say
"never".
i
would
say
that
it
is
unlikely
that
summary
judgment
would
be--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--if
it
could
be
shown
that
her
fear
was
unreasonable.
but,
like
negligence,
the
reasonability
of
her
fear
is
something
that
likely
is
going
to
have
to
be
weighed
by
the
trier
of
fact.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
if
she
had
not
used
it,
and
if
she
could
explain
why
she
did
not
use
it.
we
ask
only
that
an
objectively
reasonable
fear
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
well,
in
the
cases
in
the
studies
cited
at,
i
believe,
note
32
of
our
brief,
there
is
widespread
fear
amongst
women
of
retaliation
if
they
complain
about
sexual
harassment.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
retaliation.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
no...
no,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
precisely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
i
do...
i
do
not,
your
honor.
and
there...
and
that's
why
there
is
a
reasonable
fear
in
the
work
place
for
complaining
about
this.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
no,
justice
souter,
there
is
not
always
going
to
be
reasonable
fear.
because...
there
is
going
to
be
reasonable
fear
at
the
summary
judgment
stage.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
these
cases
are
going
to
be
disposed
of
on
summary
judgment.
i
think
there's
plenty
of
time,
however,
that
the
juries
will
say,
this
is
nonsense.
this
woman--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--that
case
did
not
go
to
summary
judgment.
i
think
that
comes
closer
to
it.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
i
think...
i
think
it's
a--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
it's
going
to
depend
on
the...
the
factors
of
the
work
place.
is
the
policy
enforced?
how
much
power
does--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--if
the
employee
could
demonstrate
that,
notwithstanding
the
policy,
that
she
had
a
reasonable
fear
of
retaliation
if
she
came
forward.
this
would
depend
on--
mr.
william
r.
amlong
--no.
an
objectively
reasonable
fear.
i
would
want
to
point
out
to
the
trier
of
fact
the
degree
of
control
that
the
employer...
that
the
supervisor
exercised
over
the
work
place.
i
would
want
to
point
out
the
other
kind
of
rules
they
have
there.
is
he
allowed
to
hire
and
fire
at
whim?
i
would
want
to
point
out
his
history
in
dealing
with
employees.
i
would
want
to
deal
with
whether
he...
whether
he
has
the
reputation
as
a
bully.
what
we're
saying
is
that
if
the
supervisor
is
allowed
to
get
away
with
this
behavior,
that
that
gives
rise
to
a
reasonable
fear,
justice
ginsburg.
if
i
may
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
thank
you,
chief
justice.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
thank
you,
your
honor.
justice
o'connor,
the...
the
need
for
a
policy,
even
back
in
1985,
is...
is
exemplified
by
the
knowledge
by
that
time
of
sexual
harassment
in
the
work
place.
the
eeoc's
policy
requiring
employers
to
do
something
had
been
on
the
books
since
1980.
there
was
widespread
knowledge
about
it.
the
movie,
9
to
5>
["],
people
knew
sexual
harassment
was
going
on.
and
the...
and
the...
the
problem
with
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
is
that
it
discourages
persons
to
come
forward
and...
i'm
sorry...
it
discourages
employers
from
having
the
kind
of
policy
that
will
bring
these
reports
to
their
attention.
as
judge
tjoflat
noted
in
dissent,
this
rewards
ostrich
like
behavior.
it's
hear
no
evil,
see
no
evil,
pay
no
lawsuit.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
justice
ginsburg,
my
position
is
that
if
there
was
a
policy,
it
would
not
make
an
automatic
difference,
that...
but
it
would
be
a
factor
to
be
considered.
now,
they
had
a
policy.
they
just
didn't
tell
anybody
about
it.
and,
in
fact,
the
policy
said,
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
mr.
gordon
had
an
obligation
to...
to
report,
the
policy,
which
is
found
at
page
267
of
the
joint
appendix,
says,
in
pertinent
part,
a...
speaking
about
the
eeoc
guidelines
under
the
guidelines,
an
employer
is
responsible
for
the
actions
of
its
supervisory
employees
or
agents
and,
in
some
cases,
for
the
acts
of
others
when
the
employer
or
a
supervisory
employee
knows
of,
or
should
have
known,
the
behavior.
now,
mr.
gordon
knew
of
the
behavior.
he
had
actual...
actual
knowledge.
he
did
not
report
it.
the
behavior
of
which
he
knew,
justice
souter,
was
of...
just
like
discrimination
against
african
americans.
it
is
that...
this
is
not
somebody
asking
for
a
date.
this
is
two
supervisors,
for
whatever
purpose,
engaging
in
the
crudest
treatment
possible
of
these
two
women.
it
is
not
merely
a
frolic.
it
is
the
same
kind
of
behavior
that,
were
it
to
have
been
directed
to
an
african
american,
were
he
to
have
been
called
these
epithets,
and
were
he
to
have
been
badgered
repeatedly,
there
would
be
no
question
that
this
was
discrimination.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
justice
souter,
there
is
no
principal
distinction
between
that
kind
of
discrimination
and
this
kind
of
discrimination.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
it's
especially
hard
to
find
out
if
there
is
no
policy,
and
if
robert
gordon
does
not
report
it
up,
number
one.
mr.
william
r.
amlong
the...
it
is...
i
do
not
expect
that
a
klansman
personnel
manager
is
going
to
announce
mr.
smith,
i'm
not
hiring
you
because
you're
black.
so
it
is...
it
is
not
that
much
harder
for
them
to
find
out.
what
we
have
here
is
we
have
terry
and
silverman,
through
their
acts,
altering
the
terms
and
conditions
of
the
employment.
thank
you.
