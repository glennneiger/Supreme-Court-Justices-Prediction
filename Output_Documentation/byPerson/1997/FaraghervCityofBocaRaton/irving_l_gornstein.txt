mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
our
position
is
that
respondent
is
potentially
liable
for
the
hostile
work
environment
experienced
by
petitioner
on
three
different
grounds.
first,
that
respondent's
delegation
of
authority
to
terry
to
run
the
beach,
coupled
with
the
failure
to
disseminate
an
anti
harassment
policy,
made
the
creation
of
a
hostile
work
environment
possible.
second,
that
knowledge
of--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
although,
i...
i
would
have
to
elaborate
on
the
standard
for
deciding
when
it
is
that
the
delegation
of
power
has
made
the
creation
of
the
hostile
work
environment
possible.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
this
is
not
an
negligence
argument.
the
second
ground
is
that
the
respondent...
knowledge
of
it
should
be
imputed
to
respondent,
because
one
of
respondent's
supervisors
knew
about
it.
and
third
a
possible
ground
of
liability
is
that
the
respondent
should
have
known
about
it,
but
did
not,
because
it
failed
to
disseminate
an
anti
harassment
policy.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
is
a
"should
have
known"
standard.
and
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--correct.
and--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i...
i...
i...
i...
there
is
a
causation
issue
that
goes
along
with
the
third
theory.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there...
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
correct.
and
on
the
third
theory,
it
would
have
been,
had
the
policy...
would
they
have
known
about
it
had
they
had
distributed...
had
they
distributed
a
policy...
an
effective
policy.
so
there
is
a
causation
issue
on
the
third
question.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
souter,
there
is...
there
will
be
uncertainty
in...
in
many
cases.
and
then
the
question
will
be
who
bears
the
risk
of
uncertainty
in
that
situation.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
a
fair
argument
could
be
made
that
the
employer
of
that
situation...
in
that
situation...
should
bear
the
risk--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
if...
if
the...
unless
the
employer
can
make
that
showing.
or
you
reject--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--or
if
you
reject
the
view
that
he
should
have
the
burden,
and
place
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff.
a
plaintiff
could
satisfy
that
burden
in
a
number
of
ways.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
plaintiff
herself
could
have
testified
that
had
there
been
an
effective
policy,
i
would
have
complained.
and
then
if
that
testimony
is
believed,
causation
is
demonstrated.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
mr....
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
that...
that
is
a...
that
is
the
classic
negligence
theory.
which
is,
should
the
employer
know...
known
about
it.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i...
i
think
that
the...
the...
the
problem
is
difficult
enough,
that
in
most
cases,
if
an
employer
does
not
adopt
a
policy,
they
would
not
be
exercising
reasonable
care.
but
i
would
leave
room
for
cases
in
which
an
employer
could
show
that
it
has
exercised
reasonable
care
in
relationship
to
this
problem
if
they
have
adopt...
adopted
policies.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
there
are
two...
two
problems.
not
everybody
knows
about
it,
first
of
all,
justice
o'connor.
but
even
if
they
know
about
it,
they
may
not
be...
they
may
not
know
that
the
employer
is
willing
to
do
something
about
it.
and
that's
why
the...
the...
a
policy...
a
clear
policy
against
discrimination
that
is
disseminated
to
everyone,
and
where
the...
the
employer...
it's
made
clear--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
i
think
that
returns
me
to
the
first
potential
line...
liability
here.
and
that
is
that
there
should
be
liability
when
the
supervisor
is
aided
by
the
agency
relationship,
in
the
sense
that
he
is
able
to
impose
a
hostile
work
environment
because
the
employee
reasonably
fears
adverse
employment
consequences
if
she
resists
or
if
she
complains.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
when
there
is
an
effective
policy
in
place,
it
has
the
capacity
to
remove
reasonable
fear.
and
when
an
employer
can
show
that
it...
its
policy
has
all
the
elements
of
a
good
policy,
and
they're
listed
in
the
eeoc
guidance,
and
that
that
policy
has
been
effectively
disseminated
to
everyone,
and
that
it's
clearly
understood
that
the...
the
employer
takes
this
seriously,
there's
a
complaint
mechanism,
then
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show,
through
case
specific
evidence,
that
notwithstanding
such
an
effective
policy,
she
nonetheless
reasonably
feared
adverse
employment
consequences
if
she
resisted
or
complained.
i
think
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that...
that
is
a
different
case,
mr.
justice...
justice
kennedy.
and
in...
in
that
case,
we
would
say
that
the
employer
is
liable.
and
the
employer
is
liable
because
there
the
role
of
supervisory
power
is
clear.
and
the
employer
is
liable
in
that
situation.
now,
the
reason
the
employer
is
liable
there
is
the
same
reason
that
an
employer
is
liable
when
a
supervisor
fires
a
black
employee
because
he
has
a
personal
aversion
to
blacks
in
the
work
place,
notwithstanding
anything
that
the
employer
might
have
done
to
prevent
that
from
happening.
and
that's...
that
is
because,
in
that
case,
it's
still
the
case
that
the
discrimination
was
made
possible
by
the
delegation
of
power
from
the
employer
to
the
supervisor.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
we...
if
it's...
if
it's...
if
it's
an
explicit
request--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
it's
an
explicit
threat
of
adverse
employment
consequences--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--again,
we
would
say
that
the
employer
is
liable
in
that
situation,
where
there's
an
invocation
of
power.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes,
we
are...
we
are...
now
we
are
getting
to
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that...
that's
correct.
and
that's
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
does.
and
that's
because,
in
that
case--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
invocation
of
power
is
clear.
and
i...
i
might
add
that
this
is
the
case
the
court
is
essentially
is
going
to
have
next
sitting.
so
i'm
not
sure
i
want
to
spend
that
much
time
on
it.
that
is
what
is
at
issue
in
eller
for...
for
the
court
next
sitting.
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
the
question
is
has
the...
that
harassment
been
made
possible
by
the
delegation
of
power
from
the
employer
to
the
supervisor?
and
the
line
we
draw
is
between
those
cases
in
which
supervisory
power
makes
it
possible
and
those
cases
in
which
the
supervisor
is
simply
taking
advantage
of
proximity
in
the
same
way
that
a
co
worker
would.
and
the
reason
that
we...
we
hold
employer
liable
in
those
situations
is...
is
twofold.
it
serves
two
important
title
vii
purposes.
first,
it
provides
a
greater
incentive
for
employers
to
root
out
discrimination
from
their
work
places.
and,
second,
it
provides
compensation
to
an
innocent
employee--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--because,
by
the
delegation
of
power
itself,
and
by
the
absence
of
an
effective
policy
providing
the
person
a
way
around,
there
will...
there
can
be
a
reasonable
fear
that
adverse
employment
consequences
will
be
imposed.
