mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
hostile
environment
sexual
harassment
is
seldom
within
the
scope
of
employment.
it
is
seldom
within
the
authority
that
is
given
to
a
supervisor.
we
believe
that
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
properly
applied
a
test,
that
is
essentially
a
test
of
negligence,
to
deal
with
this
situation.
was--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--excuse
me,
ms.
justice,
i
didn't
hear
the
first
part
of
your
question.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
no,
that
is...
that
is
no
longer
a
case
of
hostile
environment
sexual
harassment,
it
is
a
case
of
disparate
treatment.
i
mean,
i
grew
up
in
a
world
where
most
discrimination
that
occurred
was
disparate
treatment,
that
people
were
treated
differently
because
of
their
gender
or
their
race.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
when...
when...
when
a
supervisor
takes
what
justice
posner,
in
the
jansen
case,
called
is
a
company
act,
the
hiring
somebody
or
not
hiring
somebody,
that
is
an
act
that's
separate
from
the
motivation
of
the
act.
it
is...
it
is
an
act
that's
an
official
act
of
the
company.
and
if
that
act
is
tainted
by
a
discriminatory
motive
or
a
discriminatory
intent,
it's
a
violation
of
title
vii.
it's
always
been.
and...
and
that
is
the...
that
is
the...
at
least
the
fundamental
distinction
between
a
quid
pro
quo
situation
or
a
disparate
treatment
situation
on
one
side,
and
hostile
environment
situation
on
the
other.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
that
is
an
unsettled
question,
since
i
believe
the
lower
courts
are
wrestling
at
the
present
time
as
to
what
a
quid
pro
quo
violation
is.
at
least--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
there
is
a...
there
is
a...
there
are
three
categories
of
quid
pro
quo,
one
where
the
person
is
fired.
that's
a
company
act.
that
is,
if
i
fire
somebody
because
of
their
gender,
that's
a
violation
of
title
vii.
i
don't
believe
that
that
principle
is
in
dispute.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
no.
when
there
is
disparate
treatment
discrimination,
it's
not
a
matter
of
employer
negligence.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
he
is
responsible
for
the
conduct
of...
that
occurs
at
the
beach.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
but
when
that
supervisor
departs
from
the
scope
of
the
employment--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--no.
in
that
case,
he
made
a
hiring
decision.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
but
the...
in...
in...
in
the
case
of
hostile
environment,
the...
the
effect
of...
on
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
are
as
a
result
of
an
action
that's
outside
the
scope
of
the
employment
by
the
supervisor.
in
a
normal
disparate
treatment
case,
the
effect
on
the
terms
and
conditions
of...
of
employment,
at
least
in
one
respect,
is
as
a
result
of
not
being
hired
or
being
fired
or
not
being
promoted.
and
that
is
a
fundamental
distinction.
and
it
makes...
and
it
makes
the
hostile
environment
cases
difficult
to
fit
into
the
normal
disparate
treatment
mold.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
i'm
sorry?
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
because
in--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--because
in
one
case
there
is
an
employment
action
that
is...
that
is
within
the...
the
supervisor's
authority.
the
right
to
hire
and
fire
is
within
the
supervisor's
authority.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
and
this
is
a
case
where
the
supervisor
his
self...
himself
or
herself...
is
departing
from
the
scope
of
that
authority.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
but
if--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--because
in
this
particular
case,
the
activities
of
the
supervisor
in
question
were
in
pursuit
of
his
own
personal
agenda.
they
weren't...
they
weren't
carrying
out
the
responsibilities
that
he
had
in
operating
the
beach.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
it
included
supervising
the
employees.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
and...
and
there
is
no
question
that
mr.
terry
and
mr.
silverman--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
i
would
suggest
that
there's
a
distinction
between
his
supervisory
actions
and
the
frolics,
or
improprieties
and
misconduct,
that
he
committed
outside
his
supervisory
responsibilities.
we
would
suggest
that
the
record
in
this
case
suggests
that
most
of
the
things
that
went
on
that
were
offensive
to
the
lifeguards
at
boca
raton
were
done
outside
the
normal
responsibilities...
the
regular
responsibilities
of
either
mr.
terry
or
mr.
silverman.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
if...
if
he
says,
i'm
going
to
have
my
way
with
you
once
a
week,
there
is
legitimately
a
negative
implication
in
that
statement
that
if
i
don't,
you're
going
to
be
fired
or
something
bad
is
going
to
happen
to
you.
in
that
case,
you're
on
the
way
over
to
a...
a
quid
pro
quo
kind
of
situation
that's
before
the
court
in
burlington--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
would
make
a
difference
in
the
outcome.
it
would
still
be
a
hostile
environment
sexual
discrimination
for
the
employ...
for
the
supervisor
to
say
that
to
the
employee.
that
would...
that...
that
there
is...
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--your
honor,
at...
at
the
point
we're
on
in
the
hypothetical,
we're
only
a
threat
that
the
employer...
that
the
supervisor
says
to
the--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--okay.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
if
there
was...
if...
if
there
were
no
nexus
to
an
employment
action,
if
it
was
not
a
condition
of
her
employment,
it
would...
it
would
fit
into
the--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
we
know
in
this
case
that...
that...
that
there
was
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
the
activities
that
these...
that
silverman
and
terry
engaged
in
was
anything
more
than
gratuitous.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
the
degree
of
grossness
or
the
degree
of
coarseness,
or
whether
it's
verbal
or...
or
physical,
ought
not
to
make
an
operative
difference
in
the
outcome.
in
either
event,
the...
the
title
vii
works
best
when
a
regime
of
communication
is...
is
created,
where
employees
that
are
the
subject
of
either
criminal
activity
or
improper
activity
or
misconduct--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
in
this
particular
case...
and
it's
difficult
to
extrapolate
from
an
anecdote...
as
soon
as
miss
ewanchew
wrote...
wrote
the
letter,
something
happened.
an
investigation
took
place,
and
disciplinary
action
was
taken.
but
as...
i
am
not
offering
that
as...
as
the
paradigm
example.
what
i
am
offering
is...
is
an
argument
from
policy
that
suggests
that
from
an
employer's
perspective,
trying
to
find
out
the
sexual
harassment
of
the
subtle
variety
that
you
hypothesized
is
going
on
in
the
work
place
is
nearly
impossible.
a
lot...
if...
reading
the
record
in
this
case--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
to
the
extent
that
you're
in
a
room
and...
and
someone
grabs
a
part
of
your
anatomy
and...
and...
and
does
so
secretly,
it
is
difficult
for
an
outsider--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--there
was...
there's
a...
there's
a
variety
of...
of
anecdotes,
some
of
which...
for
example,
a
number
of
the
lifeguards...
female
lifeguards
testified
that
they
weren't
aware
that
conduct
vis
a
vis
other
lifeguards
was
even
going
on.
which
goes
to
the
obviousness
of
the...
of...
of
a
lot
of
the
activities.
some
of
the
verbal
activity
was
relatively
public
among
the
lifeguards.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
that's
part
of
it,
justice
souter.
i
think--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--the
other
part
of
it
is
that
when
the
employee
takes
an
employment
action,
hiring
somebody
or
not
hiring
somebody
in
a
discriminatory
fashion,
the
person
taking
that
ultimate
action
is
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
or
her
work.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
i
don't
believe
there
is
a...
a
distinction
in
knowledge,
particularly
with
respect
to
far
flung
employers,
with
operations
that
are
run,
where
hiring
decisions
are
made
by
supervisors.
i
think,
as
a
practical
matter,
there
is
a...
there
is
a...
a
great
degree
of
difficulty
in
ensuring
that
personnel
decisions
are
made
in
a
manner
that
are
consistent
with
title
vii.
however,
in...
in
the
case
of...
of
an
employer
making
that
decision
with
somebody
acting
within
the
scope
of...
of
its
employment,
i
don't
believe
that
an
employer
can
define
away
its
title
vii
responsibilities
by
saying,
joe,
you
can
hire
these
people,
but
i
don't
want
you
to
discriminate
against
title
vii;
and
remember,
your
job
only
entails
hiring
within
the
confines
of
title
vii.
in
that
situation,
the
law
of
agency
is
clear,
that--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--because
in
this
particular
case,
the
activity
that
was
engaged
in
by
the
individual
supervisors
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
exercise
of
their
supervisory
authority.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
i
think
if
you...
under
the...
the
historic
law
of
agency,
there
is
a...
a
premise.
and
the
premise
is
that
supervisors
can
act
outside
the
scope
of
their
employment.
and
when
they
do,
they're
on
their
own.
justice
hand
had
a
bosun's
case,
where
a
drunken
bosun
beat
up
a...
a
sailor--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
the
difference
is
that,
in...
in
the
case
when
the
supervisor
departs
from
the
scope
of
employment,
he's
acting
on
his
own.
and--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--yes,
because
the...
but
in...
in
every
case
of
a
corporation,
the
employer
is
acting
through
individuals,
and
the
act
of
the
individual
is
the
act
of
the
corporation,
unless
the...
the
supervisor
departs
from
the
scope
of
his
employment.
if
mr.
terry
decided
that
he
was
going
to
begin
to
steal
from
the...
from
the...
from
the
women
lifeguards,
on...
on
the...
because
they
were
women,
and...
so
disparate
treat...
disparate
action
with
respect
to...
on
the
basis
of
sex
with
respect
to
the
women
lifeguards.
and
he
does
this
stealing.
the
question
is
is
he
within
the
scope
of
his
employment?
should
the
employer
be
automatically
liable
to
the
women
lifeguards
for
the
theft?
now,
you
get
back
to
the
question--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--cases
your
honor--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--it
depends
whether
or
not
the...
a...
the
court
will
find
that
that's
part
of
a
pattern
of
not
engaging
equally...
equal
employment
hiring
decisions.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
okay,
no
discrimination.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
if...
if
you
assume
he's
not
qual--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--the
act...
precisely...
the
act
of
hiring
is
within
the
scope
of
his
employment.
why
he
hires--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--that's
the
reason
we
don't
let
them
off
the
hook
when
they
don't
hire
somebody
because
they're
a
woman
or
because
they're
black.
because
the
act
of
hiring
is
within
the
scope
of
employment.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
yes.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
in
that
particular
case,
there
are...
are...
vicarious
liability
can
flow
to
the
employer
by
virtue
of
the
conditions--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--because
it's
a
dangerous
condition
is
one
of
the
historic
exceptions
to...
that
creates
vicarious
liability.
the
court
had
a
case
20
years
ago
involving
feces
in
a...
in
a
food
warehouse.
and
found--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--vicarious
derivative
liability
to
the...
to
the
president
of
the
company,
who
knew
nothing
about
it.
the
court,
in
its
decision,
concluded
that
it
was
a...
that
there
was
a
public
health...
an
overriding
public
health
justification
for
the
regulation
that
created--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--yes.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
if
it's
noisy,
your
honor...
i
mean,
i...
i
think--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--yes.
i'm
reluctant
to
try
to
an...
analogize
a
hostile
environment
sexual
discrimination--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
from
the
perspective
of
the
city
of
boca
raton,
they
do
have
a
strong
interest
in...
in...
in
avoiding
this.
i
mean,
this
is
a
terrible
situation.
the...
the
conduct
of
these
supervisors--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
hostile
environment
because
of
race
is
a...
is...
is...
is...
i
would
analogize
it
to
this
situation.
and...
and
i
think
the
same--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--it...
yes,
in
a
parallel
situation.
if...
if
these...
if
the
things
that
happened
to
these
lifeguards
happened
because
they
were
black
or
because
they
were,
you
know,--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--we
don't...
i'm...
your
honor,
i'm
suggesting
that...
that...
that
there
is...
at
least
the
lower
court
decisions
do
not
draw
a
distinction
between
a
hostile
environment
situation
involving
race
and
one
involving
sex.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
because
in
a
hiring/firing
decision
because
of
race,
there's
a
company
action
made
for
which
the
company
is
responsible.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
why?
i'm
sorry--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--i'm
embarrassed
to
give
you
the
same
answer
that
i...
i
gave
you
before,
your
honor.
i
apologize
for
this.
but
in...
in...
in
one
case
there
is
a
corporate
action
being
taken
within
the
scope
of
the
employment...
not
hiring
or
promoting...
and--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--yes,
that
would
be
the
position--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--that
negligence...
the...
the
employer...
in...
in
a
case
where
the
supervisor
is
not
exercising--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--and
your
hypothetical
is
slightly
off--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--but
assuming
that
it...
it
was
not
within
the
scope
of
employment
and
he
was
not--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--they
should
be.
but
if,
in
both
cases
the
employer
assigns...
makes
adverse
assignments
or...
or--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--but...
but
the
act
of
making
assignments
down
in
the
beach
was
in
the
scope
of
terry's
employment.
and
if
terry's--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--they
would
be
parallel.
they
would--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--they
would
be
parallel.
and
there'd
be...
and
there
would
not
be
liability
in
the...
in
the
racial
discrimination
context
unless
there's
actual
knowledge?
for
a
gratuitous
comment
made
by
a
supervisor--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
but
now...
that...
that's...
i
think
in
the
case
of
the
lifeguard
and
in
the
case
of
the...
of
the
secretary--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--race
and
sex,
you
would
have
the
same
outcome.
the
employer
would
be
liable
in
both
cases.
because
there--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--because
the
distinction
is
when
i
make
assignments
on
a
discriminatory
basis,
i'm
liable.
when
i
make
gratuitous
comments
and...
and
do
gross
things
and
make
coarse
comments
to
an
employee,
i
am
not
acting
within
the
scope
of...
of
my
employment.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
and
that
is
the
fundamental
distinction.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
then
it
would
be
the
same
case.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
we
believe
the
objectives
of
title
vii
would
be
hurt.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
i--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--i...
i
think
it's
related
to
the
problem
of
liability,
as
a
practical
matter.
and...
and...
and
to
speak
somewhat
cynically
for
a
moment,
if...
if
the
law
was
such
that
if
whatever
the...
the
standard
is,
the...
an
employer/supervisor
violated
the
standard,
there
was
automatic
liability...
if
i'm
an
employee
in
the
work
place
and
a
gross
comment
is
made
to
me,
but
i'm...
you
know,
i
can
live
with
it...
but
all
of
a
sudden,
one
day
it
dawns
on
me,
hey,
there
may
be
some
money
here.
so
i
let
this
conduct
continue.
i
don't
object
to
it.
i
don't,
you
know,
say,
stop
it,
to
the
supervisor
doing
it
to
me.
i
just
go
on
and
on.
and
at
some
point
in
time,
i
reach
the
magic
moment.
either
it
permeated
or
pervasive,
whatever
the
standard
you
want
to
use.
and
i
say...
and
i
drop
my
charge
in
with
the
eeoc.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
we--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--this...
unfortunate...
or
fortunately
for
the
city
of
boca
raton,
this
was
prior
to
the
amendments
in
1991.
now,
we
have
compensatory
damages
and...
and
at
least
with
respect
to
private
employers,
you
have
punitive
damages
that
are
available.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
yes.
with
respect
to
gordon,
it's...
we
believe
that...
that
the
conversations
that
occurred
with
gordon,
one,
were
not
complaints,
were
not
made
with
an
expectation
that
mr.
gordon
would
take
the
matter
up.
he
communicated
back
to
the
people,
saying,
i'm...
it's
not...
i'm
not
going
to
take
it
up.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
well,
i
think
that
the
standard
is
whether
he
had
a
duty.
and
at
least
in
agency
law,
one
standard
would
be
whether
he
had
a
duty
to
make
the
report,
or
was
he
higher
management
and
can
deal
with
it?
gordon
was
no...
in
no
position
to
deal
with
terry.
terry
was--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
mr.
bender,
when
he
testified,
thought
that
the
lifeguards
themselves
should
have
reported
it
to
him
that
this
was
going
on.
he
thought
that
mr.
gordon
should
have
reported
it.
but
it...
it
isn't...
there
is
nothing
in
mr.
gordon...
in...
in
mr.
gordon's
duties,
as
the
training
captain
of
this...
on
this
beach,
that...
that
requires--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--yes.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
no.
i
think
the
obligations
would
be
in
tandem.
i
don't
believe
that--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--i
would
assume
that
there
would
be
a
presumption
that
that
was
correct.
and,
you
know,
without
looking
at
more
facts
with
respect
to
the
duties
and
responsibilities
set
out
in
the
regulations
and
handbooks
and
training--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--well,
there's
an
expectation
and
a
hope.
and
i
think
that
was
evident
in
mr.
bender's
testimony.
but
i
don't
know
that
there
is
a
duty,
a
legal
duty,
that
is...
that
is
punishable
in
some
way
for
failing
to
make
that
kind
of
report.
i
mean,
particularly--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--yes,
he
said,
in
the
same
sentence,
he
said
he
also
though
the
lifeguards
had
an
obligation
to
report
it,
too.
and
i...
so
i
think
mr.
bender
was
speaking
optimistically,
as
a
manager
speaks
about
what
you
would
hope
that
your
employees
would
do
in
a--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--i...
i
think
it
is
relevant
to
the
question
of
negligence.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
we're
back
in
1985
with
these
cases.
and
the
country's
sensitivity
about
these
matters
were--
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
--i...
no,
i
don't
believe
the
employer
is
protected.
mr.
harry
a.
rissetto
i
think
the...
the
question
in
all
cases
is
whether
he
knew
or
should
have
known.
and
if...
if
he
didn't
know,
was
the
employer
playing
an
ostrich,
like...
that's
a
question
of
proof
that
would
be
presented
under
a
negligence
standard.
in
this
particular
case,
ms.
faragher,
in
1990,
after
she
had
decided
to
go
to
law
school,
had
the
policy.
thank
you,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
