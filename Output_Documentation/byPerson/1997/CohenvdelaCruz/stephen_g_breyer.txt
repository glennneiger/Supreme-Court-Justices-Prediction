justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is...
did...
am
i
right
in
thinking
you've
looked
through
the
legislative
history
of
the
1984
amendments,
you've
read
the
reports,
you've
looked
at
the
floor
statements,
et
cetera,
and
you
couldn't
find
anything
as
to
any
reason
why
congress
made
the
linguistic
change.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there
is
no
reason,
then...
and
if
the
language
permits,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
before,
why
shouldn't
we
read
this
exactly
the
same
as
it's
always
been
read
in
the
history,
i.e.,
liability
on
the
claim.
they're
talking
about
a
claim.
in
other
words,
they're
talking
about
a
judgment,
i.e.
they're
talking
about
what
is
normally
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding
a
piece
of
paper.
the
bankruptcy
judge
sits
there,
he
says,
i've
a
piece
of
paper
it
has
a
number
on
it.
you
go
read
the
number.
you
ask
the
question,
is
this
piece
of
paper
in
an
action
for
fraud.
it
is
or
it
isn't.
if
the
answer's
yes,
you
write
in
the
number.
if
the
answer's
no,
you
don't.
now,
i
take
it,
if
there's
no
intent
whatsoever
to
make
a
change...
and
we
haven't
found
any.
they
said
it
was
stylistic...
then
that's
the
simple
way
that
bankruptcy
proceedings
used
to
work,
and
what's
the
reason
for
making
it
more
complicated
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
go
back
to
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
language,
as
you
read
it,
says
liability
on
a
claim,
because
debt
is
defined
as
liability
on
a
claim,
then
we
look
to
see
whether
the
changes
that
were
made
in
the
lang...
well
you've
heard
my
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's...
i
understand.
my
question
is,
is
there
any
reason
for
treating
the
interpretation
of
the
present
language
differently
from
the
interpretation
of
the
prior
language
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
i...
now,
the
answer
might
be
yes,
or
it
might
be
no,
but
i
asked
about
the
history--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
they
said
it
was
just
stylistic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
want
to
go
back
to
that
one
case
you
said.
i
mean,
the
odd...
i
think
the
language
that
gives
me
the
most
trouble
from
your
point
of
view
is
the
words,
to
the
extent.
why
did
they
put
that
in
if
they
meant
claim?
you
know,
liability
on
a
claim,
a
claim
for
fraud,
you
just
say
the
thing
that's
nondischargeable
is
liability
on
a
claim
for
a
fraud.
that's
the
end
of
it.
why
did
they
put
this
word,
to
the
extent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where...
is
there
such
a
thing
as
a
claim,
and
the
claim--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--was
that
the
case
that
you
just
mentioned
that?
you
have
a
claim
for
money,
or
a
claim
for
property
and
the
claim
is
for
money,
and
part
of
the
claim
is
for
money...
some
of
the
money
is
obtained
by
fraud
and
some
of
it's
not
obtained
by
fraud.
i
mean,
is
there
such
an
animal
as
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this...
can
i
just...
are
you
finished,
because
i
want
to
get
my...
are
you
finished
with
that
response?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
the...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
this.
the
credit
card
company
says
smith
went
bankrupt,
and
smith
owes
me
$50,000,
so
my
claim
as
the
credit
card
company
is,
i
have
a
claim...
i
say
smith
is
liable
on
my
claim
for
$50,000.
now,
$20,000
of
that
he
obtained
by
fraud,
so
i
have
a
claim
for
50,
and
that
claim
for
50
is
fraud...
is
for
fraud
to
the
extent
of
20,000.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
your
position,
your
view
is
that
that
claim
is
a
claim
for
fraud
to
the
extent
of
$20,000,
and
any
liability
on
that
claim
for
$20,000
is
liability
on
a
claim
to
the
extent
obtained
by
fraud.
so
if
liability
on
that
portion
of
the
claim
$20,000
is
$100,000
because
of
punitives,
et
cetera,
the
whole
thing's
nondischargeable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
case
that
said
all
that
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
in
re
danns
was
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
you're
saying,
if
you
want
to
know
why
congress
used
the
language
it
did,
read
in
re
danns
and
at
that
point
you'll
see
what
the
drafter
had
in
front
of
him,
or
whoever
drafted
it,
and
that's
why
they
chose
that
language.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
part,
though,
i
don't
think
was
conceded
by
mr.
ayers.
i
don't
know
that
they
concede
that
even...
so
we
go
back
to
danns
and
we
say,
this
is
all
the
same
for
the
history
of
bankruptcy
law.
they've
always
meant
the
same
thing.
but
what
is
that
same
thing,
and
at
that
point
i
think
they
have
not
conceded
that
even
if
you
go
back
to
1890,
that
there
would
be
liability
for
the
punitives
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
has
it
been
clearly
held
that
if
you
go
back,
let's
say,
to
the
1898
act
or
the
1978
code,
et
cetera,
that
it
does
include
punitives?
i'm
not...
have
they
conceded
that?
i'm
not
certain.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you
might
say,
liabilities
for
means
liabilities
to
this
person
and
a
punitive
damage
award,
after
all,
is
not
in
respect
to
a
liability
to
this
person
and
represents
a
liability
to
the
whole
community
for
bad
action
deterrent.
you
know,
that
kind
of
argument.
i'm
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
trying
to
generate
a
little
more
counterargument
on
your
part.
