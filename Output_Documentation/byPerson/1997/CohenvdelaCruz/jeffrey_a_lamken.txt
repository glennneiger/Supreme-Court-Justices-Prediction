mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
nearly
a
century,
bankruptcy
law
has
excluded
from
discharge
all
liabilities
arising
from
the
debtor's
fraud,
including
consequential
and,
where
imposed,
punitive
damages.
nothing
in
section
523(a)(2)
alters
that
settled
practice.
the
code
defines
the
term,
debt,
as
liability
on
a
claim.
section
523
(a)(2)
thus
exempts
from
discharge
liability
on
a
claim
for
money
or
services
to
the
extent
the
money
or
services
were
obtained
by
fraud.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
i
would
not
define
punitive
damages
as
consequential
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
mr.
ayer
would
concede
that
consequential
damages
to
the
creditor
are
within
his
interpretation.
his
interpretation
limits
what
is
nondischargeable
to
the
amount
actually
obtained
by
the
debtor.
now,
if
the
debtor
also
makes
an
additional
profit,
he
was
considering
the
possibility
of
including
that,
but
the
consequential
damages
are
clearly
excluded--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--consequential
damages
do
follow
from
torts.
i
think
the
example
on
page
21
of
our
brief,
for
example,
where
the
defective
bolts
are
sold
to
an
airline
with
a
representation
that
they're
aircraft
quality,
the
consequential
damages
would
be
the
cost
of
actually
replacing
those
bolts.
that
would
not
represent
money
obtained
by
the
debtor,
but
it
would
represent
consequential
damages
and
therefore
a
proper
recovery
under--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
this
case...
well,
consequential
damages
i've
used
rather
loosely.
i
should
apologize.
those
are
actual
damages,
but
they
are
not
restitutionary
damages.
they
are
damages
that
are
incurred
by
the
creditor
but
do
not
represent
a
gain
to
the
debtor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
i
think
the
question
assumes
that
the
phrase,
a
claim
for
money
obtained
by
fraud,
means
a
claim
to
acquire
or
to
obtain
the
money
which
was
obtained
by
fraud.
i
think
it's
clear
that
congress
did
not
use
the
phrase,
debt
for,
or
claim
for,
in
that
sense.
from
section
(a)(2)(a)
itself,
that
refers
to
a
claim
for
services
obtained
by
fraud.
it's
clear
that
the
creditor
is
not
trying
to
acquire
the
services
that
were
obtained
by
fraud.
what
the
creditor
wants
is
the
liability
that
was
imposed
as
a
result
and
that
liability
can
include
punitive
and
consequential
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
don't
think
if
you
go
back
to
1898
it
could
be
disputed.
the
1898
act
excepted
from
discharge
judgments
in
actions
for
fraud.
i
don't
think
that
the
phrase,
judgments
in--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--no.
i
think
there's
a
concession
in
the
petition,
but
i
think
the
concession
has
been
retracted.
however,
the
cases,
first
the
language
itself,
judgments
in
actions,
is
unmistakably
clear.
a
judgment
includes
the
consequential
damages
and
the
punitive
damages.
in
this
case,
the
court's
case
brown
v.
felsen
explains
that
when
the
change
was
made
to...
from
judgments
in
actions
to
liabilities
for
obtaining--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
don't
think
that
that
construction
of
the
word
liability
could
be
used,
because
the
term
debt,
which
is
defined
as
liability
unclaimed,
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
include
punitive
damages
where
payable
to
private
parties.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
would
disagree
that
the
language
favors
petitioner,
because
that
is
only
true
if
you
don't
look
at
the
definition
of
the
word
debt.
the
word
debt
is
liability
on
a
claim.
i
don't
think
you
could
be
any
clearer
that
a
claim
for
money
or
property
or
services
obtained
by
fraud
under
new
jersey
law
is
three
times
the
damages
so
imposed
and
therefore
the
claim,
the
liability
on
the
claim
is
the
full
amount
of
the
judgment
that
would
be
entered
by
a
new
jersey
court
in
this
context.
the
structure
of
523
(a)
i
believe
confirms
this.
section
523
(a)(6)
and
(a)(9)
make
nondischargeable
liability
on
a
claim
for
death
or
injury,
or
liability
on
a
claim
for
wilful
or
malicious
injury.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
i
think
the
run
up--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
run
up
of
credit
card
bills
at
the
last
minute
has
been
specifically
addressed.
what
has
not
been
addressed,
your
honor,
however,
is
the
trans...
repeated
credit
transactions
in
which
some
portion
of
credit
is
obtained
by
fraud
and
some
portion
is
not.
before
1970
there
was
a
split
in
the
courts
on
whether
or
not
the
full
amount
of
credit
was
nondischargeable
simply
because
a
small
portion
thereof
had
been
obtained
by
fraud,
and
that's
the
in
re
danns
decision.
the
legislative
history
in
1978
shows
that
congress
was
aware
of
this
issue.
i
believe
that
the
language
added
in
1984
is
most
reasonably
read
as
making
it
unmistakably
clear
that
there
must
be
a
parsing
process
to
determine
how
much
was
obtained
by
fraud,
how
much
was
not
obtained
by
fraud,
and
all
of
the
liability
on
a
claim
for
the
portion
that
was
obtained
by
fraud
is
nondischargeable,
and
that
liability
may
include
consequential
and
punitive
damages.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that
is
absolutely
correct.
lawyers
often
refer
to
a
claim
by
what
caused
the
claim
to
arise,
and
sometimes
by
the
result.
we
might
speak
of
a
claim
for
personal
injury,
the
result,
or
we
might
speak
of
a
claim
for
battery,
what
caused
the
injury.
in
the
context
of
this
statute,
congress
has
used
those
two
interchangeably,
as
lawyers
often
do.
sometimes
they
spoke
of
a
debt
for
fraud,
the
action
that
produced
the
injury,
or
a
debt
for
wilful
and
malicious
injury,
the
result.
in
our
portion,
in
(a)(2),
it
says
a
debt
for
money,
property,
or
services
to
the
extent
obtained
by
fraud,
the
result,
but
that
does
not
alter
the
amount
of
liability,
necessarily.
the
amount
of
liability
is
that
amount
which
would
be
imposed
by
a
state
court
and
that
amount,
in
this
case,
is
three
times
the
injury
so
imposed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
cede
the
remainder
of
my
time.
