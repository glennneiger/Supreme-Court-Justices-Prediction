then
mr.
ayer,
you
would
concede
that
your
argument
leads
to
the
result
that
is
suggested
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
at
page
21.
that
is,
the
bolts
that
were
sold
with
fraudulent
representation
for
$5,000
and
then
there's
a
crash
of
the
plane--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
that
if
it
isn't
wilful
and
malicious,
just
reckless--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
the
result
is
$5,000
and
not
what
it
cost
to
rebuild
the
plane.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
no
opinion
of
this
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
greenberg
said,
this
statute
says
money
obtained
by
fraud.
it
doesn't
say,
monetary
relief
imposed
because
of
fraud.
