justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
think
it
wouldn't
even
include
attorney's
fees
and
costs
in
the
very
action
in
which
the
recovery
is
made?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
know
that
it's
all
that
clear
from
the
language.
what
does
debt
for
mean?
does
it
mean
liability
on
a
claim
for?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
rely
on
the
phrase,
to
the
extent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
you
indicate
that
before
the
1984
amendments
to
the
statute
courts
generally
thought
punitive
damages
were
nondischargeable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
i
mean,
that
was
the
general
holding
of
the
courts.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
at
least
that's
what
your
brief
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
ayer,
(a)(4)
says
in
effect
that
a
discharge
does
not
discharge
a
debtor
from
any
debt
for
fraud
while
acting
in
a
fiduciary
capacity.
there,
there
is
no
language
about
money,
or
property,
or
to
the
extent
obtained
by.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
under
(a)(4)
would
punitives
be
recoverable
and
attorney's
fees
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
filed
on
behalf
of
your
client
on
page
9,
footnote
4,
it
says
resort
to
legislative
history
is
unnecessary,
given
the
plain
language
and,
prior
to
1984,
(a)(2)
barred
discharge
of
a
debt
for
obtaining
money
by
fraud,
which
courts
construed
to
bar
discharge
of
both
compensatory
and
punitive
damages
in
fraud
cases,
and
that's
language
from
your
petition.
i
took
it
to
mean
that
was
what
the
interpretation
was
before
the
amendment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
amendment
just
added
to
the
extent.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
(a)(4)
it
would
all
be
nondischargeable
and
the
only
difference
in
language
of
the
two
is
the
to
extent--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
referring
to
this
general
section
of
(a),
subsection
(a).
subsection
(a)(7)
says
that
it's
not
dischargeable
to
the
extent
such
debt
is
for
a
penalty
payable
to
a
governmental
unit
and
is
not
compensation
for
actual
pecuniary
loss,
other
than
a
tax
penalty.
there
the
congress
has
specified
certain
penalties
that
will
be
nondischargeable,
those
payable
to
the
government.
does
that
mean
that
they
thought
about
penalties
such
as
punitive
damages
that
aren't
payable
to
the
government
and
didn't
include
them
anywhere?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
at
least
we
know
from
(a)(7)
that
congress
thought
about
penalties--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
the
extent
they're
payable
to
the
government.
sometimes
punitive
damages
are
payable
to
a
governmental
unit.
maybe
in
that
case
it
would
go
under
(7).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
language
of
(a)(2)
really
does
favor
the
petitioner.
a
discharge
doesn't
include
a
debt
for,
in
this
case,
money
to
the
extent
obtained
by
fraud.
it
favors
the
position
taken
by
the
petitioner,
and
you
ask
us
to
look
back
at
the
older
provisions
for
guidance,
i
guess.
