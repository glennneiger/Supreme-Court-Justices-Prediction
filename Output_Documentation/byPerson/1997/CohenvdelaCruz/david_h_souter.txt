justice
david
h.
souter
am
i
correct
that
in
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
you
were
assuming
that
debt
or
claim
and
money
are
synonymous,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
under
the
statute
they're
not
synonymous.
there
are
certain
debts
or
claims,
and
those
debts
or
claims
may
to
some
extent
represent
money
obtained,
so
that
if
you
recognize
the
distinction
between
claim
on
the
one
hand
and
the
money
that
may
or
may
not
be
represented
by
that
claim
on
the
other
hand,
you
would
have
to
answer
differently,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
would
have
to...
you
would
have
to
say
that
if
you
recognize
the
distinction
you
simply
cannot
amalgamate
money
obtained
by
fraud
and
damages
assessed
with
respect
to
that
money
obtained
by
fraud
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
you
consistently
do
in
your
argument.
you
do
identify
or
amalgamate
those
two
things
and
yet
the
statute
seems
not
to
do
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
mm
hmm.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
means
that
part
of
the
claim
represents
money
obtained
and
part
of
the
claim
represents
something
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
statute
does
not,
in
terms,
speak
in
subsection
(2)(a)
of
debts,
it
speaks
of
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
money
is
less,
in
your
example,
than
the
debt.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
when
you
start
talking
about
statutes
as
a
whole,
that
means
this
particular
language
is
against
me,
but
i'm
going
to
try
to
find
a
broader
purpose.
do
you
concede
that
as
long
as
you
make
the
distinction
between
the
debt
or
claim
and
the
money
on
the
other
hand,
recognizing
that
the
latter
may
be
less
than
the
former,
the
language
of
the
statute
is
against
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
wasn't
the
prior
law
in
exactly
the
form
that
justice
scalia
used
as
his
contrast?
wasn't
the
operative
phrase
in
the
prior
law
debt
for
obtaining,
as
opposed
to
debt
for
money
obtained
by?
isn't
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
doesn't
his
argument
use
debt
in
exactly
the
same
way?
debt
is
used
synonymously
with
claim,
but
his
argument
simply
depends
upon
the
fact
that
the
statute
recognizes
that
some
debt
is
for
money
obtained
and
other
debt
is
for
judgments
rendered.
that
is
to
say,
and
this
is
the
same
question,
that
debt
means
claim
as
further
defined
subsection
by
subsection
by
subsection?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying,
in
a
word...
in
a
short
phrase,
i
guess,
that
debt
for
money
means
exactly
the
same
thing
as
the
old
statute
meant
when
it
said
debt
for
fraud,
except
that
it
defines
the
money
with
respect
to
the
fraudulent
means
of
obtaining
it,
by
a
later
phrase.
is
that...
in
one
sentence,
is
that
your
argument?
