--mr.
ayer,
following
up
on
justice
o'connor's
thought,
is
it
not
true...
you
looked
at
the
issue
much
more
carefully
when
you...
before
you
filed
your
merits
brief,
of
course,
and
are
backing
away
from
the
footnote,
but
doesn't
the
footnote
express
what
the
treatise
writers
thought
the
law
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
they
dispute
that.
i
mean,
you
say
there's
no
question,
but
he
thinks
there's
a
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
isn't
any
legislative...
may
i
just
ask
this
one
question.
we've
talked
about
a
hypothetical
in
which
the
debt
would
be...
justice
breyer's
$50,000,
the
$20,000
of
it
was
obtained
by
fraud
and
that
you're
only
talking
about
the
consequence
of
that
$20,000.
are
there
any
real
live
cases
out
there
that
you
can
cite
that
present
situations
similar
to
that
hypothetical?
this
one
doesn't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand,
but
they
would
not
have
added
onto
them
any
penalty,
as
you
do
here.
that's
the
problem.
justice
john
paul
stevens
theoretically,
but
i...
i'm
just
concerned
about
the
absence
of
any
litigated
case
that
presents
the
hypothetical
that
you
rely
on.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
get
you
to
comment
on
one
question
that
came
up
in
your
opponent's
argument?
the
prior
law
is
uncertain,
you
say,
but
what
about
the
1898
statute?
that
was
perfectly
clear,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
would
necessarily
include
the
punitive--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--of
course,
that
language
may
be
clear
enough
that
you
didn't
need
a
case.
