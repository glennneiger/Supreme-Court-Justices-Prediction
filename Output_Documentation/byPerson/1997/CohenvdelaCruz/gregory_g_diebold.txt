mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
considered
in
light
of
the
history
and
structure
of
the
code,
the
clear
purpose
of
the
phrase,
to
the
extent
obtained
by
fraud,
is
to
distinguish
between
legally
obtained
property
or
money
and
fraudulently
obtained
money
or
property.
in
fact,
the
precise
language
that
was
used
in
the
amendment
was
taken
from
a
case,
in
re
danns,
a
second
circuit
case,
which
discussed
that
very
issue,
noted
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
authority,
and
held
that
in
a
situation
where
a
debtor
obtains
money
through
a
legal
credit
transaction
and
then
subsequently
commits
an
act
of
fraud
and
then
obtains
additional
money
through
a
refinancing,
the
amount
of
money
that
gives
rise
to
the
debt
is
the
amount
obtained
through
fraud,
but
it's
the
debt
which
is
nondischargeable,
and
the
debt
has
been
defined
and
is
still
defined
by
the
code
as
the
liability
on
a
claim.
the
liability
on
a
claim
is
the
amount
that
you
become
liable
for
as
a
result
of
the
money
that
you
obtained
by
fraud.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
well,
it's--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--my
response,
justice
scalia,
is
that
it's
a...
what's
nondischargeable
is
the
debt.
the
debt
is
based
on
a
claim
for
money
to
the
extent
that
the
money
was
obtained
by
fraud.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
it's
difficult
to
say
that
if
you
concede,
which
we
don't,
that
obtained
is
used
to
limit
the
amount
of
debt
that
you
occur...
incur,
but
what
you're...
what
we
say
obtained
is
limiting
is
to
explain
that
the
fraud,
that
there
must
be
fraud
in
connection
with
the
money
you
obtained
and
that
gives
rise
to
the
nondischargeable
debt,
which
in
this
case,
under
new
jersey
law,
is
three
times
the
amount
of
the
overcharged
rents.
like
in--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--i
think
they
used
to
the
extent
as
a
way
of
showing
that
the
debt
was
limited
to
the
extent
that
you
obtain
money
through
fraud,
but
what
is
nondischargeable
is
that
debt
which
arises
from
the
obtaining--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--well,
the
debt--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--i
think
that
happens
all
the
time
in
the
commercial
world.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
let
me
use
an
example
in
the
credit
transaction.
it
very
often
happens
that
in
a
credit
card
situation
you
charge
things,
you
incur
bills,
and
then
you
decide
you're
going
to
file
for
bankruptcy,
and
a
month
before
you
go
to
the
attorney
and
you
file
for
bankruptcy
you
run
up
$10,000
worth
of
debt.
courts
have
held
that
that
money
is
obtained
by
fraud,
so
to
the
extent
that
your
credit
card
bill
was
obtained
by
fraud,
that
debt
is
nondischargeable,
but
if
the
state
of
new
jersey,
as
it
has
in
this
case,
chooses
to
impose
a
penalty
for
that--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--that's
correct,
you
don't
obtain...
you
obtain
money.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
but
you
obtain
a
debt
for
obtaining
that
money
which
is
nondischargeable.
the
debt
here
happened
to
be
more
than
the
money
you
actually
obtained,
three
times
more.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
no,
justice,
i
don't
think
it--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--it
does.
i
think
that
first
of
all
with
(a)(7),
the
difference
between
(a)(7)
and
(a)(2)
is
that
it
has
to
be
a
debt
owed
to,
or
penalty
owed
to
the
government,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
code
itself
which
restricts
or
makes
each
of
those
sections
exclusive.
a
non
government--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--exactly,
and
we
also
know--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--that's
correct.
there's
no
requirement
of
fraud
in
(a)(7),
so
that
the
government
can
recover
those
penalties
regardless
of
what
the
reason
for
their
imposition
was.
in
(a)(2),
of
course,
there's
a
requirement
that
the
private
party
show
fraud.
but
(a)(7)
also
demonstrates
that
congress
knew
clearly
how
to
distinguish
between
compensatory
damages
and
punitive
damages
if
they
wanted
to.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
that's
correct.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
the
$100,000
is
nondischargeable.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
in
re
danns
made
the
distinction
between
those.
now,
in
addition
to
that
we
have
the--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--no,
your
honor
is
misreading...
is
not
misreading
the
case,
but
the...
danns
did
not
involve
the
imposition
of
a
trebling
punitive
factor,
but
the...
what
danns
did
hold
is
that
the
statutes
permitted
the
discharge
of
that
portion
of
the
debt
which
was
not
obtained
by
fraud.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
i
respectfully
think
that
your
honor
is.
we
both
agree
that
the
statute...
i
believe
we
both
agree
that
the
statute
permits
a
severing
of
that
obtained
legally
and
that
obtained
by
fraud.
the
question
is,
does
the
statute
in
addition
prohibit
the
imposition
of
treble
damages
or
other
penalties
or
punitive
damages
based
on
the
amount
obtained
by
fraud,
which
in
your
honor's
hypothetical
would
be
the
$20,000.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
well,
i'm
not
sure
i'm
following--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--well,
except
that
the
statute
defines
debt
as
a
liability
on
a
claim.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
and
in
this
case
the
liability
on
the
respondent's
claim
was,
under
new
jersey
law,
three
times
the
amount
of
the
money
obtained
by
fraud.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
well,
if
i
can
use
an
example
to
i
think
answer
what
i
believe
to
be
your
honor's
question,
let's
assume
that
in
this
case
the
legal
rent
is
$500
and
the
landlord
had
a
good
faith
reasonable
belief
that
the
rent
was
$600,
but
he
decided
to
tack
on
another
$100
because
he
thought
he
could
get
away
with
it.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
amount
between
$500
and
$600
would
be
fully
dischargeable.
the
amount
between
$600
and
$700
is
the
amount
that
he
obtained
by
fraud
but
that...
but
the
debt
that
that
obtaining
would
create
would
be
$300
under
new
jersey
law.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
it
speaks--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--the
statute,
though,
as
a
whole,
deals
with
the
nondischargeability
of
debt.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
no,
i
don't
concede
that.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
i
don't
think
it's
possible
to
define
debt
in
different
ways
depending
on
the
subsection
that
you're
using.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
i
think
as
a
matter
of
grammar
that's
a
possible
interpretation,
but
to
reach
that
conclusion,
your
honor
would
have
to
assume
that
in
1984
congress
intended
to
change
what
was
i
believe
concededly
the...
at
least
the
majority
position
that
punitive
damages
under
(a)(2)
were
not
dischargeable.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
that's
correct,
but
i
think
that
the
danger
of
looking
at
just
the
phrase
that
we're
concerned
about
in
this
case
is
that
it
disregards
the
complete
absence
of
any
legislative
history
to
support
the
position
that
the
petitioner
wishes
you
to
adopt.
i
don't
think
that
it's
reasonable
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
decided
to
reduce
the
liability
of
a
debtor
for
fraudulent
conduct
without
at
least
some
discussion
or
reference
to
it
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
it
didn't
deal
in
terms
of
punitive
damages
specifically.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
no.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
that's
correct.
that
would
be
my
position,
and
i
think--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--i
don't
think
that
the
language,
the
operative
language
in
section
(2)
is
attempting
to
further
define
debt,
though.
i
think
that
even
the
petitioner
concedes
that
the
holding
in
the
levy
case,
which
held
that
the
phrase
modified
debt,
is
correct.
i
think
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
do,
as
was
shown
by
the
1978
legislative
report
that's
quoted
at
page
19
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
is
to
distinguish
between
how
that
debt
was
obtained.
the
entire
structure
of
the...
of
523
is
to
define
or
list
certain
types
of
conduct
for
which
debts
will
not
be
dischargeable.
the
conduct
that
is
non...
that
gives
rise
to
a
nondischargeable
debt
under
(a)(2)
is
that
conduct
which
is
fraudulent.
if
you
obtain
money
legally
and
fraudulently,
then
the
statute
allows
you
to
separate
those
two
situations
and
only
the
debt
based
on
the
fraudulently
obtained
money
would
be
nondischargeable.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
yes.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
that's
right,
and
the
very
language
to
the
extent
by
is
in
the
in
re
danns
opinion.
our
position,
if
i
may
sum
up,
is
that
there
is...
there
is
really
no
question,
if
this
case
were
brought
20
years
ago,
that
the
punitive
damages
would
not
be
discharged.
congress
in
1984,
throughout
the
little--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--well,
even
this
court's
opinions
have
talked
about
liabilities
for
fraud.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
there
was
no
opinion
directly
deciding
this
issue
prior
to
1984
under
the
old
language
of
the
code,
but
there
are...
there
were
opinions
of
this
court
that
used
the
term
liabilities
for
fraud.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
well,
that's
correct,
and
perhaps
congress
could
have
written
this
a
little
better
but
the
fact
is,
i
believe,
that
congress
would
not
have
changed
this
statute
and
how
it
operates
significantly
in
the
way
that
the
petitioner
wishes
you
to
read
it
without
some
discussion
of
it.
the
discussion,
what
little
there
was,
about
consumer
debt
and
bankruptcy
show
that
congress
was
concerned
about
curtailing
debtor
abuse.
you
would
have
to
conclude,
in
order
to
rule
in
favor
of
the
petitioner,
that
what
congress
did
in
1984
was
stop
and
say,
okay,
but
let's
give
a
break
to
fraudulent
debtors
and
reduce
their
liability
and
i
don't
think
that
under
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
that
that's
what
congress
intended
to
do.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
well,
i
can't
cite
actually
reported
cases,
but
i
think
it
occurs
all
of
the
time
that
credit
card
companies
seek
the
nondischargeability
of
debts
which
are
run
up,
say,
at
the
last
minute,
prior
to
filing
bankruptcy.
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
well,
they
may.
under
new
jersey
law
they
would,
if
the
court
determined--
mr.
gregory
g.
diebold
--i'm
not
aware
of
any.
thank
you.
