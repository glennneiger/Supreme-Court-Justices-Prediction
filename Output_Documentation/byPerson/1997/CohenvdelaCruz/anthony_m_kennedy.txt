justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
agree
with
that
reading?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
you
would
have
a
lack
of
parallelism
between
the
section
you're
addressing
here
and
subsections
(4)
and
subsection
(6).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
include
accounting...
if
the
defrauding
party,
the
wrongdoer,
makes
profits
from
the
property
that
he
steals,
are
those
profits
recoverable?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
property
obtained
by
the
fraud.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
it
seems
to
me,
follows
easily
from
the
answer
you
gave
me.
i
think
attorney's
fees
are
even
further
removed--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--under
your
interpretation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--than
profits
that
the
tortfeasor
gains.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
how
does
gerlach
work?
in
other
words,
the
bankruptcy
code
supersedes
state
tort
law
on
the
measure
of
recovery
for
fraud,
in
the
john
deere
case
that
you're
describing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ah,
to
the
extent
there
is
a
debt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
you
may
have
the
better
view
in
a
close
question
on
the
reading
of
(a)(2),
but
i'm
concerned
about
the
lack
of
parallelism
with
(4)
and
(6),
which
is
what
we've
been
addressing...
addressing
here.
if
you
prevail,
there
are
going
to
be
cases
that
might
be
classified
under
this
section
or
section...
the
section
on
malicious
conduct,
and
then
we'd
have
to
decide
whether
it
falls
under
this...
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that's
where
the
distinction
would
be
between
the
profits,
which
under
this
interpretation
would
be
recoverable,
and
attorney's
fees
and
costs
incurred
in
recovering
it,
which
is
not
recoverable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--obtained
by--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
it's
very
difficult
to
say
that
the
punitive
damages
were
obtained
by
fraud.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
how
danns
helps
you,
because
in
danns
it
was
just
the
first
part
of
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
as
i
recall
the
case,
the
$20,000
and
the
$30,000,
and
they
said
that
the
$20,000
that
was
obtained
by
fraud,
that
is
nondischargeable,
not
the
30,
or
am
i
misreading
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
debt
is
severable
for
purpose
of
applying
the
dischargeability
provisions,
which
is
what
the
petitioner
is
saying,
or
am
i
misstating?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
the
petitioner,
mr.
ayer,
is
interpreting
debt
differently
in
(2)
and
in
(6)?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
in
(2)
you
look
at
it
from
the
standpoint
of
what
the
debtor
owns
and
in
(4)
and
(6)
you
look
at
it
from
what
the
standpoint
of
what
the
creditor
is
owed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
don't
define
punitive
damages
as
consequential
damages,
do
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
the
colloquy
we
had
with
mr.
ayer,
and
i
think
he
conceded
that
maybe
some
consequential
damages
are
within
(a)(2),
even
under
his
interpretation.
we're
talking
about...
consequential
and
punitive
are
quite
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
respondent,
and
we
didn't
have
time...
i
didn't
have
time
to
question
him
about
it
further,
was
that
at
the
last
minute,
before
going
bankrupt,
people
run
up
a
lot
of
bills,
but
that's
covered
by
a
separate
section,
is
it
not,
or
would
subsection
(c)
not
permit
the
nondischargeability
under
mr.
ayer's
theory
for
the--
