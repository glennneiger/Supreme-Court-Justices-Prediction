justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
that
function
of
(6)
still
applicable?
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
why
(6)
would
make
the
question
irrelevant
then
and
not
make
it
irrelevant
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
clear
to
you
that
wilful
and
malicious
does
not
include
reckless?
punitive
damages
i
had
always
thought
were
only
given
for
intentional
torts,
and
yet
they're
given
for
recklessness.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
they're
given
for
recklessness
because
it
amounts
to
wilful
and
malicious,
as
it
does
in
the
criminal
law.
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--firing
the
rifle
into
the
empty
house.
you
don't
know
if
somebody's
there
at
all.
you
really
don't
care.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
do
wilful
ones,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
ayer,
it
seems
to
me
you
somewhat
understate
the
consequence
of
the
rule
you're
urging
on
us.
you
say
it
really
only
makes
a
difference
when
there's
recklessness
but
not
wilfulness
and
some
kind
of
a
punitive
award,
but
it
seems
to
me
it
also
makes
a
difference
when
there
isn't
recklessness
and
the
issue
is
whether
you
only
get
back
under
(a)(2)
the
money
that
the
person...
or
whether
there
is
covered
by
(a)(2)
only
the
money
that
the
person
received,
or
also
there
is
covered
whatever
profits
are
made
from
that
money,
which
often
happens.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
frankly
that's
the
part
of
your
interpretation
that
troubles
me
more
than
the
other
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
but
you
think
that
any
funds
that
are
actually
received
by
the
defendant
could
be
regarded
as
obtained
by
the
fraud.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
we
ignore
the
language
unless
there's
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
the
language
really
means
something.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
how
you
use
the
word
claim.
i
mean,
you
can
say
you
have
a
claim
for
money
that
someone
owes
you,
using
the
word,
the
object
of
the
claim
is
what
you're
entitled
to.
but
you
can
also
say
you
have
a
claim
for
fraud,
or
a
claim
for
personal
injury,
and
in
that
case
you're
using
it
to
refer
to
the
cause
of
action
rather
than
what
you're
entitled
to,
and
the
point
made
by
your
colleague
here
is
that
this
statute
uses
the
word
in
different
sections
in
different
ways.
in
(4)
and
in
(6)
and
in
(9)
it's
a
claim
for
death,
for
personal
injury,
a
claim
for
wilful
injury,
and
so
forth,
whereas
in
this
it
says
a
claim
for
money.
that's
quite
different.
and
then
it
says,
for
money
to
the
extent
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
i--
--let
me
try
it
another
way.
i
think
i'm
asking
the
same
question.
it
seems
to
me
perfectly
reasonable
to
add
on
the
trebling
in
those
sections
that
speak
of
any
debt
for
fraud,
for
wilful
and
malicious
injury,
when
they
talk
about
a
debt
for
the
wrongful
act.
anything
that
you
get
by
reason
of
the
wrongful
act,
including
the
trebling,
belongs
to
you.
but
when
they're
using
claim
in
the
other
way,
or
debt
in
the
other
way...
that
is,
a
liability
for
a
claim...
and
they're
saying
debt
for
money,
money
isn't
a
wrongful
act.
when
it
says
debt
for
money
to
the
extent
that,
there
it
seems
to
me
not
proper
to
add
on
any
trebling
that
you
get.
now,
what's
the
response
for
that?
you
have
to
understand
that
(2)
and
maybe
(7)
are
different
from
the
other
sections
in
that
they
refer
to
debt
for
what
you're
asking
for,
not
for
the
wrongful
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
defining
debt
in
different
ways.
i'm
just
noting
that
the
object
of
the
debt
is
phrased
differently
in
these
different
subsections.
in
some
cases
the
object
is
the
wrongful
act.
in
other
cases,
it
is
what
you
are
asking
for
by
reason
of
the
wrongful
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
don't
you
see
a
difference
between
what
you
can
get
for
a
claim
for
fraud
and
what
you
can
get
on
a
claim
for
money
obtained
by
fraud?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
want
them
to
get
the
interest.
you
mean,
all
they
can
get
is
the
$20,000
that
the
person
got,
and
he
gets
it
interest
free,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
even
the
market
interest
rate?
