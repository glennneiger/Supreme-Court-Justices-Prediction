we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1923,
edward
s.
cohen
v.
hilda
de
la
cruz.
mr.
ayer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
ayer,
your
question
presented
in
this
case
is
phrased
in
terms
of
punitive
damages
and
yet,
as
i
read
them,
none
of
the
statutory
sections
we're
talking
about
refer
to
punitive
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
do
you
mean
by
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
supposing
in
an
action,
an
ordinary
tort
action
for
fraud,
ordinary
damages
or
benefit
of
the
bargain
damages
are
recovered.
what
would
be
your
view
as
to
those?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
might
be
greater.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
turn...
the
issue
turns
on
whether
there's
fraud,
not
where
there
are
punitive
damages--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
ayer.
mr.
diebold,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
usually
think
of
one
obtaining
a
bill.
i
mean,
you
obtain
property
for
which
you
get
a
bill.
obtain
sounds
like
it's...
you've
succeeded
in
doing
something.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
pre-1984
language
deal
in
terms
of
punitive
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
one
doesn't
either,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
diebold.
mr.
lamken,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
of
consequential
damages
in
connection
with
contracts,
in
hadley
v.
baxendale,
not
torts.
what
do
you
mean
by
consequential
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
difference
between
consequential
damages
and
actual
damages
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
mr.
ayer,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
i'm
sure
mr.
lamken
didn't
mean
to
cede
it
to
you.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
the
case
is
submitted.
