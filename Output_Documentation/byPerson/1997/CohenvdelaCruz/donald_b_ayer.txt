mr.
donald
b.
ayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
523
(a)(2)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
creates
an
exception
to
discharge
for
individual
bankruptcies
applicable
to,
quote,
debts
for
money,
property,
services,
or
extensions
of
credit
to
the
extent
obtained
by
fraud.
the
required
fraud
under
that
section
includes
not
only
representations
that
are
consciously
false,
but
also
reckless
false
statements,
and
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
this
exception
reaches
beyond
the
amounts
actually
obtained
by
the
debtor
to
except
from
discharge
a
treble
damage
award
ordered
for
reckless
fraud.
where
the
fraud
involves
intentional
falsehoods
and
results
in
wilful
and
malicious
injury,
the
damages,
punitive
and
otherwise,
are
nondischargeable
under
a
different
section,
523
(a)(6).
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
we
do.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
we
would
your
honor
and,
in
fact,
we
think
that's
quite
clear
from
the
language,
that
the
structure
of
the
523
sections
as
they
work,
given
the
literal
reading
of
523
(a)(2),
works
quite
well.
523
(a)(2)
is
a
provision
which,
by
its
terms,
is
directed
to
the
actual
fruits
of
the
fraud.
it's
a
simple,
clear
directive
that
tells
people,
if
they
commit
fraud,
what
they
get
by
the
fraud
will
not
be
discharged.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
they
would
not
be,
your
honor.
i
think
that...
that
the
other
provisions
that
deal
with--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
it...
i
think
the
most
reasonable
interpretation
is
to
focus
upon
the
amounts
obtained
by
the
act
of
the
fraud,
which
i
would
think
most
immediately
would
be
the
amounts
obtained
in
the
fraud.
what
is
very--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
it
would
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
other
provisions,
the
(a)(6)
provision
in
particular,
which
this
court
will
address
tomorrow
in
the
geiger
case,
is
a
provision
which
is
generally
applicable,
essentially,
among
other
things,
to
all
torts,
and
it
sets
a
standard
which
says
wilful
and...
a
debt
for
wilful
and
malicious
injury.
that
has
been
interpreted
reasonably,
we
think,
to
include
punitive
damages,
to
include
other
penalty
sums,
to
include
consequential
damages,
to
include
contractually
arranged
for
attorney's
fees,
and
is
a
reasonable
and
uniform
way
of
dealing
with
what
i'll
call
damages
and
consequential
payments
that
are
owed.
our--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct.
now,
one
interesting
result
of
our
interpretation,
and
it
actually
is
played
out
in
some
detail
in
a
decision
cited
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
a
tenth
circuit
case,
in
re
gerlach,
is
that
actually
the
amount
awarded
under
(a)(2),
when
you
focus
on
the
act
of
fraud
and
what
is
obtained,
may
actually
exceed,
in
some
cases,
the
damages
that
are
otherwise
owing,
and
in
that
sense
it
seems
it
is
a
very
rational
and
sensible
message
to
people
who
may
commit
fraud.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
in
the
context...
specifically,
the
context
in
gerlach
was
a
context
where
the
operator
of
a
business
selling
heavy
equipment,
selling
john
deere
tractors,
initially
got
an
extension
of
credit
from
john
deere,
legitimately,
but
later
on
they
got
an
extension
of
that
credit
by
submitting
false
invoices
to
show
they
were
doing
business
that
they
weren't
doing.
the
court
in
gerlach
said
that
the
later
extensions
of
credit
involved
the
obtaining
of
money
by
fraud,
and
as
a
result
the
entire
amount
of
the
debt
that
was
owed
was,
in
fact,
covered
by
(a)(2),
even
though
there
might
in
that
case
be
no
damages
at
all,
so
i...
the
only
point
i
want
to
make
is
that
our
point
is
that
in
(a)(2)
you're
dealing
with
what
was
obtained.
the
other
sections
under
the
code,
(a)(6)
but
also
others,
also
(a)(4),
also
(a)(11),
other...
others
deal
with
money
that
is
gained
by
fraud,
and
they
set
up
a
different
logic.
the
logic
is,
what
did
you...
what
the
debt
is
for,
the
injury,
and
the
injury
is
interpreted
broadly,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
the
net
result
is
that...
is
that
it...
to
whatever
extent
there
is
a
debt
it
would
be
nondischargeable
under
(a)(2)
if
it
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
there
has
to
be
a
debt,
obviously,
but
it
may,
in
fact,
be
a
debt
that
is
larger
than
the
amount
that
is
damages
as
a
result
of
the
fraud.
i
guess
that's
the
point
that
i
want
to
make.
back
briefly
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
i
think
are
important.
the
respondents
here
are
some
of
the
tenants
of
an
18-unit
apartment
building
that
was
owned
by
the
petitioner
and
his
father
between
1985
and
1989.
when
their
apartment
rental
business
failed
in
the
late
eighties
as
a
result
of
falling
real
estate
values,
petitioner
filed
bankruptcy
under
chapter
7.
thereafter,
the
rent
control
administrator
entered
an
order
to
the
effect
that
there
had
been
an
overcharge
of
these
tenants
which
amounted
to
$31,000
and
the
bankruptcy
court
held
that
the
overcharge
was
nondischargeable
under
the
(a)(2)
provision.
the
court
found
further
that
actual
fraud
existed
in
that
case
on
the
ground
that
the
act
of
charging
rents
was
itself
an
implicit
representation
of
their
legality
and,
second,
that
petitioner's
recklessness
in
failing
to
determine
what
the
correct
rents
were
was
sufficient
to
establish
an
intent
to
deceive
and,
finally,
the
bankruptcy
court
held
that
because
the
overcharges
amounted
to
fraud,
treble
damages
were
appropriate
under
the
new
jersey
consumer
fraud
statute
and
then
found
that
that
amount,
indeed,
also
was
nondischargeable.
our
view
is,
as
is
apparent
already,
i
guess,
that
that
result
is
wrong.
it's
wrong
essentially
for
three
reasons:
1)
the
plain
language
of
the
statute,
which
talks
about
debts
for
money,
property,
services,
extensions
of
credit
to
the
extent
obtained
by
fraud
clearly
doesn't
include
the
amounts
that
are
punitive
in
nature--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--it
does,
your
honor.
that's...
it
is
defined
as
liability
on
a
claim
for
money,
property,
services,
et
cetera.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
we
do.
we
think
that...
there's
been
a
discussion
back
and
forth
in
this
case
about
whether
to
the
extent
modifies
money,
property,
services,
or
whether
it
modifies
debt.
i
think
everyone
agrees...
in
this
case,
at
least,
agrees
that
it
modifies
money,
property,
services.
our
difference,
i
think,
is
that...
how
we
understand
the
word
for.
in
the
petitioner's
view,
a
debt
for
a
house,
or
a
debt
for
any
particular
thing,
is
a
debt
for
what
you
have
to
pay
for
that
thing.
it's
not
a
debt
for
the
act
of
obtaining
that
thing.
it's
a
debt
for
the
thing.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
under
(a)(2)?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
your
honor,
what
is
very
interesting
about--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
would
say
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that
they
were
nondischarge...
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
interpret...
the
language
prior
to
1984
was
language
that
said,
debt
for
obtaining
money,
property,
et
cetera,
by
fraud.
now,
we
think
that's
ambiguous
language.
there
are
a
couple
of
cases,
literally
only
a
couple,
that
held
necessarily
that
that
language
does,
in
fact,
reach
punitive
amounts,
and
we
don't
think
that
it
is
illogical
to
reach
that
result,
but
what
is
important
is
that
prior
to
1984
and
prior
to
1978
even
more
so,
there
was...
there
were
not
occasions
that
came
up
that
made
courts
decide
this
issue.
the
main
reason
is
that
with
the
presence
of
the
(a)(6)
language
that
talks
about
debts
for
wilful
and
malicious
injury,
with
that
language
being
there,
any
time
conduct
results
in
wilful
and
malicious
injury,
it
doesn't
matter
what
(a)(2)
means,
or
what
is
now
(a)(2)
means.
it
doesn't
matter
what
it
means
to
have
a
debt
for
obtaining,
and
so
courts
in
deciding
these
cases,
as
we
talk
in
some
detail
about
in
footnotes
13
and
14
of
our
reply
brief,
of
the
yellow
brief,
the
courts
typically
didn't
focus
specifically
on
the
meaning
of
that
prior
language.
they
didn't
have
a
reason
to,
and
so
it
isn't
possible
to
say
here,
as
the
court
has
said
in
a
number
of
cases,
there
was
an
important
pre-1978,
or
pre-1984
bankruptcy
practice
that
had
been
established.
indeed,
there
was
no
clear
practice
that
had
been
established.
it
is
not
our
mission
here
to
tell
you
that
the
meaning
of
those
words,
if
it
mattered
what
the
pre-'78
words
meant
and
you
didn't
have
(a)(6)
and
you
had
to
decide,
might
a
court
decide
that
they
in
fact
meant
to
include
punitive
damages.
maybe
they
did.
it
isn't
clear.
i
would
only
say
that,
when
reviewing...
what
you
review
justice
breyer
for
the
court's
opinion
in
the
o'gilvie
case,
which
talks
about,
under
the
different
statute,
under
the
irs
statute,
whether
damages
on
account
of
personal
injury,
whether
those
include
punitive
damages,
and
the
court
ruled
that
they
did
not,
if
that
is
an
admissible
result,
it
seems
to
me
it's
certainly
admissible
to
conclude...
one
could
conclude
that...
that
a
debt
for
obtaining
money
by
fraud
doesn't
include
it.
our
only
point
is
that
it
was
ambiguous.
it
never
got
clearly
resolved
by
the
courts
but
in
a
single
case
that
we're
aware
of,
a
ninth
circuit
case
called
houtman.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
is
still
applicable,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
it
is
true
that
this
case
and
this
court's
decision
in
this
case
is
only
going
to
be
determinative
in
the
group
of
cases...
and
i
debated
whether
to
characterize
it
as
the
sliver
of
cases
or
a
larger
group
of
cases,
but
the
group
of
cases
that
involves
conduct
that
is
fraudulent,
meaning
it's
at
least
reckless,
but
it
falls
short
of
being
wilful
and
malicious.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
justice
ginsburg,
i
know
your
question,
i
think.
it
does
lead
to
the
result
that
that
conduct,
like
other
kinds
of
tortious
conduct,
will
produce
nondischargeability
of
punitive
damages
only
where
the
conduct
is
found
wilful
and
malicious.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
that...
i
mean,
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
mean,
that
i
think
is
some
part
of
the
question
pending
in
the
geiger
case
which
will
be
argued
tomorrow,
and
it
has
been
our
understanding
from
reading
the
cases
that
we're
aware
of
that
two
things
are
clear
under
the
law.
one
is
that
reckless
misrepresentations
do
come
within
(a)(2),
that
it
is
fraud
under
the
restatement
and,
as
this
court
incorporated
in
essence
the
restatement
into
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--and
secondly--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--correct,
and
secondly...
i
mean,
our
best
reading
of
the
cases
is
that
wilful
and
malicious
requires
a
measure
of
intentionality
and
knowing
conduct
vis
a
vis
the
harm
that
results.
now,
we
could
be
wrong
about
that.
it's
not
an
issue
that
has
been
raised
in
this
case
because
thus
far
no
one
has
suggested
that
the
conduct
here
was
wilful
and
malicious,
and
i
guess
i
would
submit
that
that's
highly
unlikely,
given
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
implicit
representations
based
simply
on
the
fact
that
he
charged
a
certain
rent,
and
recklessness
in
failing
to
ascertain
what
they
thought
the
legal
rent
was.
i
would
think
that
would
be
hard
to
find
wilful
and
malicious,
but
i
will
not
attempt
to
define,
you
know,
the
case,
the
outcome
of
the
case
tomorrow.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
mean,
our
understanding
of
the
statute
as
it
now
reads
is
that
there
are
several
provisions
that
make
nondischargeable
various
damages.
we
would
submit
that
the
(a)(2)
provision
is
essentially
not
a
damages...
it
doesn't
deal
with
damages.
it
deals
with
the
specific
act
of
obtaining
something
by
fraud
and
it
says,
no,
you're
going
to
be
stuck
with
that
if
you
got
it
by
fraud.
the
other
provisions,
the
(a)(4)
provision
relates
to
fraud
by
a
fiduciary,
among
other
things.
the
(a)(11)
provision
is
a
special
provision
enacted
with
regard
to
fraud
in
the
context
of
federally
insured
institutions
and
(a)(6),
dealing
with
wilful
and
malicious,
as
the
court
suggested
in
footnote
2
of
the
grogan
decision,
that
might
be,
the
court
said
there...
didn't
try
to
decide
the
issue,
but
suggested
that
that
might
be
a
sensible
place
to
focus
the
discussion
of
whether
or
not
fraudulent
conduct
is
wilful.
so
the
lack
of
parallelism
i
would
submit
is
the
product
of
the
fact
that
(a)(2)
is
looking
at
something
else.
(a)(2)
is
looking
at
the
act,
the
obtaining,
and
saying
no,
you
can't
keep
that,
and
the
rest
of
it
creates,
you
know,
frankly
i
would
say
a
uniform
and
sensible
system.
if
the
line
that's
to
be
drawn
as
a
matter
of
policy
is
that
nondischargeability
comes
when
conduct
gets
bad
enough
that
you
can
say
it's
wilful
and
malicious,
then
why
should
fraudulent
conduct
be
any
different
than
other
kinds
of
tortious
conduct?
why
would
you
single
that
out?
they've
already
singled
out
the
act
of
obtaining
by
fraud.
that's
important.
that's
a
significant
thing.
but
why
should
we
reach
in
and
say...
why
should
the
court
reach
in
and
say,
well,
we
know
it
only
really
matters
when
you
have
reckless
fraud,
and
we
know
that
it's
going
to
make
nondischargeable
statutory
treble
damage
awards
such
as
in
this
case
where
somebody
acts
by
an
implicit
representation
based
on
reckless
failure
to
determine
facts.
that's
really...
the
situation
of
reckless
fraud
is
the
only
one
where
this
case...
i
think
it's
the
only
one
where
this
case
makes
any
difference,
because
when
you
get
beyond
reckless
fraud
and
you
say
wilful
and
malicious,
then
you're
dealing
with
it
under
(a)(6),
and
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
use
that
phrase,
rightly
or
wrongly,
as
a
generic
reference
to
include
not
only
common
law
punitive
awards
and
statutory
treble
damage
awards...
is
that
addressing
your
question?
we
don't
mean
by
punitives
to
focus
only
on
the
amount
of
jury
awards
as
a
punitive
damage
award
in
the
conventional
sense.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
mean
to
encompass
awards
that
are
in
the
nature
of
a
penalty.
the
court
below
specifically
assumed
for
purposes
of
this
case,
without
deciding,
that
the
treble
damage
penalty...
treble
damage
award
in
this
case,
the
trebling,
was
solely
for
punitive
purposes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
our
view
would
be
that
the
(a)(2)
provision
should
be
read
in
accordance
with
its
terms
and
that
would
mean
that
the
amount
that
the
debtor
got
by
fraud
would,
in
fact,
go
back.
the
benefit
of
the
bargain
damages
may
or
may
not
equal
that.
you
can
conjure
up
all
sorts
of
different
factual--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--they
might
be
greater.
as
i
indicated
before,
they
might
conceivably
be
less
and
i
guess
the
affirmative
point
vis
a
vis
(a)(2)
is
that,
in
doing
what
congress
said
in
this
statute,
they've
created
a
very
clear
statement,
we
think,
and
a
clear
statement
that
is
important
as
a...
essentially
a
wall
against
fraudulent
conduct.
it's
a
directive
that
says,
if
you've
got
it
by
fraud,
you
don't
get
to
keep
it.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct,
and
nor
on,
indeed,
whether
there
are
damages,
whether
there
have
been
found
to
be
specific
damages.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i...
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
that
is...
i
mean,
in
all
honesty,
your
honor,
that
is
a
possible
extension
of
the...
of
our
reading
of
it
that
i
will
say
in
all
honesty
had
not
occurred
to
me,
but
it's
a
possibility,
that
in
other
words
it
is
possible,
perhaps,
to
say
that
you
got
this
money
by
fraud
and
then
you
got
profits
by
fraud,
but...
you
got
profits
from
that
money
and
therefore
all
of
that
was
obtained
by
fraud
and
i
must
say,
i
think
that's...
that
is
an
interpretation
which
i
do
think
could
be
reasonable
in
the
context--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
i
mean,
i
think
that...
i
think
that
punitive
damages,
i
think
that
consequential
damages,
i
think
that
other
damages
which
do
not
grow
directly
from
what
was
obtained
clearly
are
not
encompassed
within
(a)(2),
and
that
you
deal
with
those
damage
issues
in
the
context
of
either
(a)(6)
or
one
of
the
other
special
sort
of
egregious
wrong
provisions
that
are
in--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
that's
a
reasonable
reading,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
there
is
a
one
sentence
reference
that
talks
about
the
change
being
stylistic.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
words
to
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
language...
there
are
several
parts
to
the
answer.
the
language
says
liability...
if
you
put
all
the
pieces
together,
the
liability
on
a
claim
as
relevant
here
for
money
to
the
extent
obtained
by
fraud.
that
is
not
the
same
as
saying
liability
for
the
act
of
obtaining
money
by
fraud.
that's
our
first
point.
our
second
point
is
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
except
for
the
fact--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--okay--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
guess
i
would
make
two
points,
one
which
i
made
before
and
that
is,
the
prior
language
never
needed
to
be
and
in
fact
i
would
submit,
looking
at
our
footnotes
13
and
14,
never
was
definitively
interpreted
the
way
your
honor
has
indicated,
but
the
most
important
reason
is
that...
well,
i
won't
say
the
most
im...
i
think
the
most
important
reason
is
the
words
of
the
statute.
beyond
the
words
of
the
statute
and
the
structure
and
the
lack
of
a
prior
clear
precedent,
all
of
which
we
submit
is
dispositive,
there
is
the
very
important
fact
that
this
whole
set
of
provisions,
523(a),
is
a
set
of
exceptions
to
discharge
that
applies
only
in
the
context
of
individual
bankruptcies.
more
than
90
percent
of
individual
bankruptcies
are
now
consumer
bankruptcies
relating
to
consumer
debts,
and
what
we
know
is
that
congress
in
1978
was
substantially
concerned
about
the
problems
of
the
ineffectiveness
of
the
bankruptcy
process
vis
a
vis
consumer
debtors,
was
concerned
about
overreaching
creditors,
was
concerned
about
creditors
who
were
aggressively
asserting
positions
using
the
nondischarge
provision
specifically
referred
to
by
this
court
in
field
v.
mans,
talking
in
terms
of
the
financial
statement
provisions
and
the
abuses
by
such
creditors.
a
broad
construction
of
these
words...
the
case
before
the
court
involves
certain
facts.
it
represents
a
relatively
tiny
proportion
of
the
bankruptcy...
individual
bankruptcy
cases
in
this
country
to
which
it
will
apply.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
they
have
been
so
held,
your
honor.
correct,
they
have.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--it
is
true...
it
is
true
that
the
houtman
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
did
so
hold
and
we
discuss
that
in
our
brief.
it
did
so
hold
in
a
case
that
did
involve
reckless
fraud.
it
did
not
discuss
the
issue,
however,
in
any
detail.
there
is
that
case
that
held
that.
there
are
other
cases
that
held
punitives
to
be
nondischargeable
in
a
situation
where
the
court
said
generally
either
523
(a),
or
we
have
(a)(2),
(a)(4),
(a)(6)--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
it's--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
structure
of
(a)(2)
says
debt
for
money,
property,
services.
it's
debt
for
a
thing
versus
debt
for
an
act.
(a)(4),
(a)(6),
(a)(9),
others
of
the
provisions,
use
the
construction
debt
for
wilful
and
malicious
injury,
debt
for
fraud
by
a
fiduciary...
that
construction,
and
i
think
it's
quite
reasonable,
has
been
found
to
result
in
all
of
the
damages
for
that
act
being
found
nondischargeable.
the
construction
that
says
debt
for
money,
or
debt
for
property,
is
a
debt
for
the
property,
and
that's
our
position.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
that
the
prior
version
of
collier's
took
that
position.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
that
that's
true,
but
i
also
think
it's
true
that
there
was
virtually
no
authority
on
it.
may
it
please
the
court,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
just
want
to
make
one
point,
and
it
relates
to
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
about
the
credit
card
situation.
i
would
submit
that
a
broad
reading
of
this
provision
here
so
as
to
essentially
use
the
prior
language,
read
broadly,
as
it's
read
in
(a)(6),
reading
debt
for
obtaining
money
by
fraud
creates...
that
broad
reading
to
include
all
essentially
consequential,
punitive,
and
other
damages
would
create
a
situation
where
a
credit
card
company
who
could
come
in
and
argue
reckless
fraud
with
regard
to
the
$20,000
that
was
spent,
and
then
can
argue
$30,000
more
in
interest
at
18
percent
under
their
contract
and
then
can
argue
another
$10,000
in
attorney's
fees,
that
in
that
circumstance
they
can
come
in
and
make
a
credible,
if
not
a
winning
argument
that
in
fact
all
of
that
is
something
that's
entitled
to
nondischarge.
now,
that
is
something
that's
a
real
life
issue.
i
would
direct
the
court,
if
it's
interested,
to
the
1997
national
bankruptcy
review
commission
report.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
that
they
get
the...
well,
they
may
get
a
market
interest.
whether
they
get
a
contractual
interest
rate
i
would
submit
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i'm
sorry.
the
measure
under
justice
scalia's
hypothetical
earlier
would
be
the
benefit
that...
and
i
think
it
may
be
correct...
the
benefit
that
was
obtained
by
the
debtor,
not
the
amount
that's
contractually
owed
to
the
credit
card
company.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
1898
statute
talked
about
judgments.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
talked
about
judgments,
and--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
if
that
language
were
transported
to
today,
when
punitive
damages
is
an
issue,
which
really
only
started
in
a
big
way
in
the
1970's,
that
may
well
be
where
the
court
would
come
out.
the
fact
is,
no
one
has
come
up
with
a
case
construing
that
language.
