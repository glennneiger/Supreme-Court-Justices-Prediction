justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
ieyoub,
does
any
other
state,
to
your
knowledge,
have
this
system?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
they
each
provide,
as
louisiana
does,
for
an
open
primary
and
no
general
election
if
a
candidate
gets
a
majority?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
california
has
a
system,
i
believe,
of
allowing
crossover
voting
in
primary
elections,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
some
states
allow
crossover
voting.
in
other
words,
there's
a
primary
election
to
pick
the
party's
candidate,
but
parties...
people
who
belong
to
another
political
party
may
cross
over
and
vote--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
party
primary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
effect
louisiana
and
you
say
several
other
states
don't
treat
the
primary
election
as
a
party
primary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
why
is
it
that
louisiana
made
that
change?
i
guess
it
was
not
always
that
way.
it
wasn't
until
the
late
seventies.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you...
do
you
concede
that
congress
has
the
power
under
the
constitution
to
enact
laws
affecting
the
timing
of
election
of
members
of
the
congress?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
question,
really,
is
whether
the
statutes
that
congress
did
pass
are
contrary
to
louisiana's
scheme,
as
was
held
in
the
court
below.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
louisiana's
system
creates
a
vacancy,
so
the
vacancy
statute
applies?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
except
the
federal
statute
fixes
the
tuesday
next
after
the
first
monday
in
november
as
the
day
for
election
for
the
members
of
congress.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
election,
if
there's
a
majority
vote
in
the
primary,
does
not
occur
on
that
date.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
indeed,
most
of
the
time
it's
resolved
in
the
primary,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
ieyoub,
you
are
making
an
argument
here
today,
at
least
in
part,
that
the
voters
don't
have
standing
and
this
is
not
a
justiciable
controversy.
that
was
not
included
in
the
question,
was
it,
that
you
brought
forward
on
certiorari?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
i
read
the
question
presented,
you
said
the
specific
question
presented
is
whether
the
election
system
employed
by
the
state
of
louisiana
to
elect
its
members
to
congress
conflicts
with
federal
laws
governing
the
time
for
holding
congressional
elections.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
thought
that
was
the
question
we
were
going
to
decide.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
you
seem
to
be
arguing
something
different
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
in
the
question
presented,
however.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
only
if
some
candidate
gets
a
majority.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
you're
all
tangled
up
in
your
possibility
language.
it
doesn't
wash.
[laughter]
it
doesn't
fly.
you're...
i
don't
know
what
you're
up
here
arguing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are
statutes,
as
my
colleagues
have
indicated,
where
you
could
end
up
with
a
two-party
primary,
and
the
same
candidate
on
the
ballot
in
november,
so
that
it's
only
one
name,
or
you
could
have
a
situation
where
one
party
doesn't
make
a
nomination,
and
again
there's
only
one
name.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
a
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
louisiana
presumably
could
go
to
a
system
whereby
they
still
have
their
primary
election
but
they
provide
that
the...
if
there
is
a
majority
winner
at
the
primary
election
date,
that
name
has
to
go
on
the
general
election
ballot
before
it's
official
that
there's
an
election.
now,
will
that
do
it?
