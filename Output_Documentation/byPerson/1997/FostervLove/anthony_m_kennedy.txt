justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
accept
the
proposition
that
louisiana
law
de
jure
authorizes
elections
before
the
federal
election
date?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
a
write-in
procedure
in
your
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
about
20
percent
of
the
cases
where
a
runoff
is
held
now.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
under
your
proposal
on...
and
i
take
it
those
are
the
closest
elections,
so
under
your
proposal
the
closest
elections
are
the
one
where
there's
the
lowest
turnout.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
close
elections
are
this,
this
20-percent
category,
under
the
corrective
remedy
that
you've
just
proposed
the
closest
elections
are
going
to
be
decided
by
the
ones
with
the
lowest
turnout.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
only
corrective,
or
could...
would
it
suffice
in
your
view
if
louisiana
simply
certified
the
successful
candidate
on
the
federal
election
date?
he
had
to
be
alive,
and
then
he's
to
get
certified?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
understand
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
baker--
--what
about
the
next
point?
can...
would
it
be
satisfactory
if
this
election
scheme
basically
stayed
in
place
but
the
winner
was
just
certified
as
of
the
general
election
date?
he
had
to
be
alive,
his
name
on
the
ballot?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
it's
not
de
jure
any
more.
he's
certified
under...
louisiana
changes
the
law
simply
to
certify
the
winner
on
the
federal
election
date.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
with
every
single
election?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
with
every
single
candidate?
in
every
one
of
the
states
there
has
to
be
an
opponent
on
the
final
election
date,
on
the
federal
election
date?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
20
percent
of
the
time.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you--
--but
in
answer
to
my
question
you
said
that
if
the
certification
laws
were
changed,
and
you
just...
and
louisiana
just
delayed
certification
until
the
general
election,
that
would
not
be
sufficient.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
a
question
of
what
is
a
de
jure
election,
i
suppose,
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it's
very
clear
that
there
is
a
possibility
that
the
de
jure
election
will
be
in...
on
the
federal
election
date,
and
you've
indicated
that's
all
that's
necessary,
and
that's
what
louisiana
has.
