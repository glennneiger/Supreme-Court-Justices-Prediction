justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
question
is
when
it's
allowed,
and
i
know
that
it's
called
an
open
primary,
but
would
you
explain
to
me
why
that
isn't
a
misnomer?
as
you've
said,
everyone
can
vote.
that's
the
time
everyone
votes.
it's
not
like
a
party
primary,
and
in
order
to
be
in
the
running
you
must
participate.
now,
why
aren't
those
two
features,
when
they're
combined...
everyone
votes.
everyone
who
wants
to
run
must
be
in
on
this
inning.
why
doesn't
that
add
up
to
an
election?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
that
is
the
election
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
my
question
to
you
is,
why
don't
we
just
call
it
what
it
is,
that
is,
an
election,
since
everybody
votes,
and
everybody
who
wants
to
be
in
the
running
is
there?
why
isn't...
why
is
it
labeled
primary?
it
is
an
election,
and
it
seems
to
me,
being
an
election
it
conflicts
with
the
federal
single
election
day.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
could
do
that
consistent
with
the
federal
day
by
having,
if
there
are
two
people,
then
you
have
a
run-off,
as
can
happen
in
some
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
later
on,
before
january.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
interest
of
louisiana
would
be
affected
if
louisiana
said,
we're
going
to
do
our
same
thing,
except
we're
going
to
do
it
on
federal
election
day
and,
if
need
be,
in
the
20
percent
of
the
cases,
we'll
have
a
run-off.
then
you
would
be
acting
consistently
with
all
of
the
state
goals,
and
with
the
federal
law.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
your
view
is
that
no
voter,
as
long
as
they
could
vote
in
something
they
called
a
primary,
would
have
standing
to
object
to
louisiana's
deviating
from
most
of
the
country
in
having
what
is
the
election
a
month
before
everyone
else
does.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
conceded
that
you
could
harmonize
also
if
you
just
shifted
the
day
that
you
have
this
election
from
october
till
november.
then
you
would
be
totally
on
track
with
the
federal
statute.
you
would
serve
the
state
purpose.
i
don't
understand
why
the
harmonizing
doesn't
work
against
you,
because
it
seems
so
easy
for
louisiana
to
comply.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
about
conforming
by
putting
the
two
top
names,
so
you
have
your
open
primary,
as
you
call
it,
in
october,
and
then
in
november,
number
1
and
number
2
get
on
the
ballot.
you
could
do
that,
too.
you
just--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
put
the
second...
the
one
who
took
second
place
on
even--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right.
that
would
be
compliance,
too,
i
guess.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
baker,
maybe
i
misunderstood
you,
but
i
think
the
premise
of
justice
breyer's
question
is
that
it
would
be
okay
to
comply
just
by
saying
that
the
one
who
gets
the
most
votes
in
october
is
on
the
ballot,
and
nobody
else,
and
nobody
else
qualifies.
i
thought
your
answer
to
that
was
that
that
would
not
be
compliance
with
the
federal
elections
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
it
would
if
you
said
the
two
top
runners.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
see
two.
one
is,
you
move
the...
what
they
call
the
open
primary
to
election
day.
another
one
is,
you
put
the
top
two.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
baker,
i
thought
that
you
had
answered
my
question
that
this
is
an
election
when
everybody
votes.
i
thought
that
was
your
distinction
between
party
primaries
that
happen
to
come
up
with
the
same
candidate
but
not
everybody
votes
together,
and
this,
which
you
agreed,
i
thought,
that
it
is
an
election
because
everybody
votes
and
everybody
who's
running
must
run,
that
those
two
things
in
combination
equal
an
election,
and
if
that's
so,
then
you
would
distinguish
your
case
from
the
party
primaries
that
may
happen
to
come
up
with
the
same
candidate.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
louisiana
has
been
candid
in
describing
its
system,
because
it
says,
if
you
have
somebody
who
comes
out
of
this
race,
whatever
it
is,
with
a
majority
vote,
that
person
is
elected.
