chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-670,
murphy
foster
v.
scott
love.
spectators
are
admonished
not
to
talk
until
you
get
out
of
the
courtroom.
the
court
remains
in
session.
general
ieyoub.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you...
general
ieyoub,
that's
how
you...
if
you
fail
to
vote
you
have
no
standing,
and
if
you
vote
you
haven't
been
injured,
i
suppose,
so
the
result
would
be
that
no
individual
voter
could
ever
challenge
the
violation,
or
claim
violation
of
the
congressional
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
would
it
be
in
the
appendix?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
in
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
just
a
minute.
you
said
you
had
raised
it
in
your
brief.
where
in
your
brief?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
general
ieyoub--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
is
the
state's
position,
if
it
has
one,
on
the
suggestion
of
justice
dennis,
or
judge
dennis,
who
i
believe
dissented
in
the
court
below,
that
if
this
is
such
a
problem
the
federal
court
could
simply
enjoin
a
declaration
that
the
candidate
was
elected?
you
can't
do
that
any
more,
but
you
could
still
conduct
a
primary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
correct,
i
know,
what
judge
dennis
said.
what's
the
state's
reaction
to
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
judge
dennis'
position
was
that
he
would
leave
it
to
the
state
to
decide.
he...
i
understood
him
to
say
that
you
could
accept
all
of
your
opponent's
arguments
and
still
solve
the
constitutional
problem
by
simply
declaring
unconstitutional
that
part
of
the
louisiana
statute
which
declared
the
person
at
the
october
primary
who
won
to
be
elected,
and
just
say
that
wasn't
so,
that
there
would
be
only
one
name
on
the
ballot
in
november,
but
the
person
wouldn't
be
actually
elected
until
then
because
you
would
strike
out
the
declaration.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
ieyoub.
mr.
baker,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--or
earl
warren
in
california.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
all
then...
if
that's
your
argument,
then
all
louisiana
would
have
to
do
to
meet
your
contention
is
to
say
the
october
primary
isn't
conclusive.
the
person
still
has
to
be
alive
in
november
and
be
on
the
ballot,
and
it's
that
time
that
he's
officially
elected.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
you're...
then
you
have
trouble
dealing
with
the
question
whether...
where
both
parties
nominate
the
same
candidate,
and
there
is
only
one
candidate
on
the
november
ballot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
also
have
to
deal
with
the
writing
of
an
opinion
in
this
case.
yes.
i
mean,
we
can't
simply
say
in
one
word,
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
we
customarily
give
reasons
why
we're
affirming.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
reasons
would
you
suggest
we
give
for
affirming?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
it
make
any
difference
that
in
one
hypothesis
the
reason
you
have
only
one
name
is
on
the
ballot
is
there
were
two
separate
primaries
and
in
both
of
those
the
same
person,
and
in
the
louisiana
case
there
were
a
number
of
people
on
the
ballot
and
only
one
person
survived.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
baker.
general
ieyoub,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
