justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
raise
it
in
your
brief?
i
confess
not
even
to
have
seen
it
in...
i
mean,
i'm
perfectly
willing
to
consider
it,
even
if
you
didn't
raise
it.
gee,
i
think...
i
think
i
ought
to
consider
it,
but
i
didn't
even
see
it
in
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
joint
appendix?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
all
new
stuff
to
me.
i
mean,
i...
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
been
nice
to
say
something
in
your
brief
if
you
were
going
to
make
a
big
deal
about
it
in
your
oral
argument--
justice
antonin
scalia
or
there's
a
big
scandal
in
between,
and
who
came
in
second
now
comes
in
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
got...
you're--
--you'd
only
put
one
name
on
the
november
ballot.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
the
answer?
you'd
only
put
one
name
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
would
be
an
election
with--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes
or
no,
i
guess.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
want
a
federal
court
to
pick
which
one
of
these
things
will
be
compliance
and
enjoin--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well
then,
you
don't
agree
with
the
dissenting
judge
below.
why
should
we
figure
out
how
you
should
come
into
compliance?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
what
your
state
legislature
considers
severable
from
the
rest
of
the
scheme.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there
is
on
louisiana.
if
the...
if
one
person
doesn't
get
a
majority,
there
will
an
election
on
election
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
have
no
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
go
home.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
demand
more
than
a
possibility
of
an
election
on
election
day.
what
do
you
demand?
justice
antonin
scalia
an
election
on
election
day.
then
what
do
you
do
about
the
states
that
have
a
filing
requirement
and
only
one
person
files?
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
you're
back
to
possibility,
now.
which
is
it?
is
a
possibility
enough,
or
does
it
have
to
be
a
certainty?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
a
possibility
here?
how
do
you
distinguish
the...
i
mean,
i
wonder,
you
know,
where
this
case
leads
us
to.
what
do
you
do
with
those...
what
do
you
do
with
the
state
where
only
one...
both
parties
nominate
the
same
person?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
party
primaries,
closed
party
primaries--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
both
of
them
nominate
the
same
person,
dwight
david
eisenhower,
or
whoever,
you
know,
some
great
american--
justice
antonin
scalia
or
earl
warren
in
california,
and
comes
election
day
there's
no
election
on
election
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
through
louisiana's
primary
rules
only
one
person
qualified.
i
mean,
it's
the
same
thing.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you're
back
to
the
chief
justice's
earlier
question.
all
you
have
to
change
in
this
law
is
the
determination
that
he's
elected,
and
just
say,
you
know,
he'll...
this
is
just
a
primary,
and
he'll
be
the
only
candidate
on
the
ballot
in
november.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
around
that,
unless
you
want
to
repudiate
those
state
laws
that
allow
partisan
primaries,
both
of
which
can
name
the
same
candidate.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
candidate's
the
only
name
on
the
ballot,
and
the
same
would
be
the
case
in
louisiana.
whoever
gets
a
majority
in
the
primary,
his
will
be
the
only
name
on
the
ballot.
what's
the
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
but
i'm
asking
the
chief
justice's
question.
if
all
that
you
changed
about
louisiana
law
was
the
statement
that
the
primary
is
conclusive
if
someone
wins
a
majority,
if
you
just
change
that
and
say
he's
not
elected
then,
he
will
be
the
only
name
on
the
ballot
in
november,
would
that
make
you
happy?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you've
got
to
tell
me
why
that's
any
different
from
the
two-party
primary
that
puts
one
name
on
the
ballot
in
november.
justice
antonin
scalia
sometimes.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
maybe
the
first
and
the
last.
[laughter]
i
mean,
that
would
give
you
an
election
on
election
day,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait
a
minute,
there
is
a
choice.
you...
i
mean,
you
don't
say
there
has
to
be
a
choice,
because
you
say
it's
okay
if
you
have
two
separate
primaries
and
you
have
no
choice
on
election
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
there's
no
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
you
be
happy
if
there
were
a
write-in
provision?
i
mean,
if
there
were
just
a
write-in?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
would
be
a
real
election.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i
guess
you'd
be
satisfied
if
we
allowed
the...
you
know,
the
first
and
the
last
in
the
primary
to
be
put
on
the
ballot.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
anything.
just
pick
a
name.
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
ought
to
be,
if
i
understand
the
rest
of
your
argument,
or
if
it
isn't,
then
the
rest
of
your
argument
has
to
be
different.
i...
you
keep--
