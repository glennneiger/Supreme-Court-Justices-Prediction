mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
the
federal
election
day
case
up
from
louisiana.
as
your
honors
know,
the
42nd
reconstruction
congress
put
the
federal
election
day
statute
on
the
books
in
1872.
the
question
presented
is
whether
the
federal
election
day
statute
nullifies
louisiana's
open
primary
system
under
which
all
registered
voters,
regardless
of
party
affiliation,
vote
for
their
candidates
for
senate
and
united
states
representative.
under
louisiana
law
as
we
know
it
since
1976,
if
a
candidate
receives
a
majority
of
the
votes
in
the
october
primary
the
candidate
is
declared
elected,
and
there's
no
contested
election
on
federal
election
day,
shall
we
say
saving
the
poor
working
man
a
trip
to
the
polls
in
nonpresidential
election
years.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
oklahoma
has
a
similar
system,
as
does
hawaii,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i'm
not
sure,
your
honor.
i
believe
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
everyone
has
a
right
to
vote
in
the
open
primary
in
october,
regardless
of
party
affiliation.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
and
all
candidates
run
in
the
primary
regardless
of
the
party
affiliation,
so
that
if
there
is
not
a
majority
vote,
then
the
two
top
vote-getters
go
into--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
do
not
know
why
they
made
that
change,
your
honor,
but
the
change
was
made
in
1976,
and
it
actually
went
into
effect
in
1978,
and
since
1978,
your
honor,
we
have
proceeded
under
the
open
primary
law
manner
of
election.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
congress
may
at
any
time
alter
regulations
as
it
see
fits,
but
i
would
point
out
that
in
20
years,
almost
20
years
of
the
open
primary,
congress
has
never
moved
to
try
to
alter
louisiana's
manner
of
electing
its
representatives
to
congress
so
as
to
force
a
determinative
election
on
federal
election
day,
and
your
honors,
the--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
argue
that
it
is
not.
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
by
congressman
butler
and
senator
thurman
in
1872,
primaries
were
unknown.
they
did
not
foresee
primaries.
primaries
were
a
creature
of
the
20th
century,
as
fully
stated
in
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
classic,
but
they
did
have
the
foresight
to
make
exceptions
for
death
or
failure
to
elect,
in
which
case
they
allowed
elections
other
than
on
federal
election
day.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
louisiana's
system
certainly
allows
for
the
election
of
a
candidate
in
october,
as
opposed
to
actually
electing
on
federal
election
day.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
louisiana's
statutory
scheme
does,
in
fact,
set
a
date
on
the
first
tuesday
after
the
first
monday.
it
does
do
that.
we
simply--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
that
what
we
have
here
is
an
old
statute
and
new
circumstances,
in
which
case
i
think
that
we
have
to
look
to
the
legislative
purpose
and
the
legislative
history,
as
chief
justice
taney
said,
looking,
if
necessary,
to
the
public
history
of
the
times
in
which
the
statute
was
passed,
and
justice
holmes
saying
you
can
look
to
the
respective
minds
of
congress.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
a
person
can
be
elected
de
jure
under
louisiana's
scheme,
but
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
thurman
and
butler
wanted
to
protect
the
right
to
choose,
and
that
is
protected
by
louisiana's
statutory
scheme.
what
was
important,
what
is
important
is,
as
hamilton
said,
the
right
of
the
people
to
choose
those
whom
they...
who
will
govern
them,
and
we
allow
that.
louisiana's
statutory
scheme
allows
that.
that
was
what
was--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
your
honor,
there
is
an
election
on
october...
in
october.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that
is
the
election
primary
date,
your
honor,
and
if
a
person
receives
a
majority
of
the
vote,
and
only
in
that
instance,
they
are
declared
elected,
and
there
would
be
no
determinative
election
on
federal
election
day.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
it
is
an
election.
it
is
also
a
system
of
voting
that
winnows
down
the
candidates
in
many
cases,
where
you
have
two
individuals
with
the
highest
vote
totals
going
into
a
general
election
on
federal
election
day,
but--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
and
that
is
possible,
but
the
state
legislature
of
louisiana,
which
we
contend
has
the
primary
authority
to
set
the
manner
of
elections,
has
acted
in
such
a
way
as
to
hold
this
scheme,
the
open
primary
scheme,
as
the
law
of
our
state.
if
we
look
at
the
hist--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--louisiana
could
do
that,
your
honor,
but
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
louisiana's
open
primary
scheme
in
no
way
really
clashes
or
conflicts
with
the
federal
election
day
statute.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
you
can't
necessarily
give
a
literal
interpretation
in
this
particular--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--simply
because
i
think
that
it
might...
it
would
lead
to
unreasonable--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--we
have
that,
your
honor.
we
have
that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
under
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
we
have
a
right
at
least
to
set
the
manner
in
which
our
representatives
to
congress
will
be
elected,
and
it
does
not
conflict
in
the
sense
that
it's
closely--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--there
is,
your
honor,
but
as
was
pointed
out
by
mr.
madison
in
his
answer
to
mr.
monroe's
question
about
the
times,
places,
and
manner
clause,
the
states
should
have
the
primary
responsibility.
the
reason
why
the
federal
government
might
have
some
control
is
that
they
were
afraid
that
if
the
federal...
i
mean,
if
the
state
legislatures
did
not
act
appropriately,
it
could
bring
about
the
dissolution
of
the
union,
and
that's
what--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor.
i
am...
i
think
that
congress
has
a
right
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
is
a
determinative
election
on
federal
election
day.
under
article
i,
section
5,
also--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
it's
a
justiciable
controversy,
because
i
fail
to
see
the
injury
that
the
respondents
have
really
suffered.
they
had
a
right
to
vote.
they
had
the
right
to
vote
in
october.
now--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--yes,
your
honor,
that
is
my
position.
it
does
not
belong
in
the
court.
the
right
of
an
individual
to
vote
in
any
manner
is
not
absolute,
and
this
court
so
stated
in
burdick
v.
decoushy,
that
the
manner
of
voting
is
not
necessarily
an
absolute
right.
now,
if
your
honors
would
look
at
the
appendix,
joint
appendix
on
page
43,
one
of
the
respondents
says,
i
did
not
vote
in
the
october
open
primary
in
which
billy
tauzin
received
a
majority
of
the
vote
and
was
thereby
elected
outright
under
louisiana
law.
i
was,
therefore,
prevented
by
the
louisiana
law
from
exercising
my
right
under
the
constitution
and
federal
law
to
vote
in
an
election.
she
did
not
vote
in
the
primary,
and
now
she's
saying
that
since
i
did
not
vote
in
the
manner
in
which
louisiana
prescribed,
i
have
been
deprived,
and
i
have
been
injured,
and
your
honor,
we
say
that
will
not
do.
that
is
just
not
correct,
and
the
matter
should
not
be
in
this
court.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
certainly
there
would...
in
our
situation,
where
there
is
an
open
primary
and
an
october
election,
when
one
fails
to
vote
they
have
not
really
suffered
an
injury
to
the
extent
that
this
court,
or
to
the
extent
it
would
create
a
justiciable
controversy
in
which
this
court--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
when
it
comes
to
the
manner
of
voting,
i
think
that's
correct,
when
it
comes
to
a
state
being
able
to
set
forth
the
manner
of
voting,
as
louisiana
has
done
in
the
open
primary.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
they
do
have
a
statutory
right
to
vote
in
november.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
at
times
there
are,
your
honor.
at
times
there
are...
there
is
the
opportunity
to
vote
in
november.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
the
history
has
been,
your
honor,
that
in
the
past
most
of
the
time
they
have
been
elected
during
the
primary,
and
i
will
point
out
that
under
article
i,
section
5,
the
congress
has
the
authority
to
challenge
the
seating
of
any
individual
elected
to
congress
and
after
20
years
congress
has
never
moved
to
remove
the
credentials
of
any
louisiana
senator
or
congressman
because
they
were
elected
in
october
as
opposed
to
november.
i
think
the
results
would
be
unreasonable
and
impractical
to
say
that
if
a
congressman
got
over
50
percent
of
the
vote
in
a
primary,
they're
not
qualified
to
serve
in
congress.
the
fact
that
they
would
get
50
percent
of
the
vote
is
an
indication
of
the
favor
that
the
people
hold
him
in,
and
to
say
that
just
because
it
was
in
october
as
opposed
to
an
election
day
in
november,
that
they
do
not
have
a
right
to
serve
after
the
people
have
chosen,
i
think
would
lead
to
unreasonable--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
we
could,
but
we
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
we
did
not,
and
in
fact--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
i
think
that
louisiana's
scheme
really
does
not
in
any
way
offer
an
abuse
to
its
constitutional
authority
to
set
the
manner,
the
primary
authority
to
set
the
manner
of
elections.
we
have
a
primary,
or
an
election,
in
october
closely
tethered
or
closely
associated
with
the
federal
election
day
in
november.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
under
our
reading
of
the
statute,
your
honor,
you're
correct.
if
we
have
a
majority
vote-getter
in
october,
then
we
feel
that
it's
a
useless
exercise
and
a
useless
expense
of
money
and
time
to
have
another
election
and,
by
the
way,
that
was
one
of
the
objectives
of
passing
the
federal
election
day.
butler
and
thurman
didn't
want
multiple
federal
elections
so
that
the
poor
working
man
would
have
to
take
multiple
trips
to
the
polls,
and
that's--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
we
have
in
our
brief--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that...
that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
we
raised
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
our
brief.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor.
no,
we
did
not.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
we
have
a
very--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
it's
either
in
the
appendix,
the
joint
appendix,
or
in
the
brief.
i
think
it's...
it
may
be
in
the
joint
appendix
where
we
raise
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
in
any
event
i--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--it's
certain
particular
motions
that
we
had
filed.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
but
your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
this
court
alone
can
raise
the--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
did
not
raise
it
in
our
brief.
i
was
thinking
of
page
24
of
the
joint
appendix,
where,
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
louisiana
we
raised
that
the
court
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
our
answer,
in
that,
so
i
apologize,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
i
made
a
big
deal
about
it
in
response
to
a
question
by
justice
souter,
and
i
think
it's
a
big
deal
when
you
really
come
down
to
it.
i
think
that...
in
ex
parte
siebold
this
court
construed
article
1,
section
4
not
as
any
federal
juggernaut
just
totally
wiping
out
regulation,
or
the
manner
of
regulations
that
were
passed
by
the
state,
but
what
they
asked
for,
what
this
court
said
was
that
we
need
cooperation
between
the
federal
sovereignty
and
the
state
sovereignty,
a
harmonizing
combination
into
one
system
of
regulations
made
by
the
two
sovereignties.
that's
what
we
have
here
in
louisiana.
the
open
primary
system,
it
doesn't
really
clash
or
conflict.
what
it
does
is,
it
harmonizes
two
sovereignties,
putting
together
election
regulations.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
that
is
within
the
purview
of
the
state
legislature
to
do
exactly
what
you
say.
they
chose
not
to
do
it
in
the
last
legislative
session,
although
they
were
faced
with
that
issue.
we
argue,
however,
that
the
history
of
the
adoption
of
article
i,
section
4,
title
2,
section
7
and
its
adoption,
indicates
that
at
the
time
it
was
passed,
at
the
time
the...
first
of
all,
it
indicates
that
the
state
has
the
primary
authority
to
regulate
the
manner
of
elections.
second,
it
indicates
that
they
didn't
foresee
primaries,
and
that
primaries
have
been
seen
by
this
court
as
an
integral
part
of
the
electoral
process,
and
that
what
the
statute
fathers
of...
in
1872
were
trying
to
do
was
to
ensure
the
right
to
choose,
and
the
people
of
louisiana
have
a
right
to
choose
their
representatives
that
go
to
congress.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
submit
that
louisiana
has
had
very
high
voter
turnout
in
the
october
primary
and--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
we
still
say
that
we
have
a
very
close
relationship
with
the
federal
election
day,
not
such
that
it's
an
abuse
of
our
constitutional
authority
simply
to
have
a
system
whereby
the
person
that
gets
the
majority
of
the
vote
is
elected,
and
there's
no
need
for
another
useless
election
on
october,
on
november
2,
or
whenever.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
state's--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--the
state's
reaction
is
that
that
can
be
done,
and
the
state's
reaction
would
be
that
that...
we
could
absolutely
do
that.
we
could
have
the
october
primary
and
just
simply
not
say,
well,
they're
not
declared
elected,
but
that
they
would
be
declared
elected
as
of
the
federal
election
day.
the
state
would
do
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
they--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--we
could
certainly
put
the
names
of
the
candidates
on
the
ballot,
though.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor
i--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
exactly--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
right,
and
that's
basically
what
happened
in--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
we
would
put
one
name
on
the--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor,
there
is
not.
there's
not
a
write-in
procedure.
but
my
time
is--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--even
if
they
don't--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--even
if
there's
a
majority?
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
be
compliance.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
i'd--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
suggest
that
you
shouldn't,
that
it's
really
congress.
if
congress
wishes
to
do
that,
it
may
do
that
at
any
time.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
exactly
right.
that's
what
justice
dennis
said,
but
prior
to
the
time
he
said
that,
he
disagreed
with
the
holding
of
the
other
two
judges
that
it
was
in
any
way
a
conflict,
or
that
our
system
was
in
any
way
in
conflict
with
the
federal
election
day
statute,
and
we
certainly
hold
to
that
particular
position,
that
the
state
has
the
primary
authority
from
the
court's
earliest
reading
of
article
i,
section
4,
that
the
state
has
the
primary
authority
to
set
the
manner
of
elections.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
under
our
present--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
think
that
it
could
do
that,
your
honor.
and
now
my
time
is
short,
so
i'll
try
to
conclude.
we
say
that
the
unfounded
fears
of
the
fifth
circuit
majority
are
contrary
to
this
court's
earliest
reading
of
article
i,
section
4,
and
to
this
court's
harmonizing
manner
of
interpreting
federal
statutes
and
companion
state
election
regulations.
i
mean,
of
course,
as
in
ex
parte
siebold.
of
course
regulations
made
by
congress
are
paramount
and
supersede
those
of
the
state,
but
only...
and
here
i
quote
one
of
this
court's
great
judges,
justice
bradley...
but
only
insofar
as
the
two
are
inconsistent
and
no
farther.
we
say
there
is
no
conflict,
no
clash
between
the
federal
election
day
and
louisiana's
primary
law.
as
justice
bradley
said
so
well
in
siebold,
let
a
spirit
of
national
as
well
as
local
patriotism
prevail.
let
unfounded
jealousies
cease,
and
we
shall
hear
no
more
of
the
impossibility
of
harmonious
action
between
the
national
and
state
governments
on
a
matter
on
which
they
have
a
mutual
and
vital
interest.
if
the
court
please
your
honors,
the
judgment
below
must
be
reversed.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
have
no
rebuttal.
