justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
of
course,
you
can
have
someone
who
became
21,
or
whatever
your
voting
age
is,
on
november
1,
couldn't
have
voted
in
october,
but
had
the
federal
statutory
right
to
vote
in
november
but
you
say,
well,
that's
tough
luck.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
no
election
in
november
under
your
system.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
that
argument
you
could
maybe
have
your
primary
in
september
and
then
if
you
need
a
run-off
have
that
in
october.
it
would
still
be
all
right
under
your
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't...
they
could...
you
could
just
ignore
the
november
date.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
didn't.
i
understand
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
as
a
matter
of
law,
if
we're
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
law
requires,
you
could.
the
law
really
is
a
nullity
as
far
as
it
requiring
any
particular
date
for
the
congressional
election
in
louisiana.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
it
isn't
necessary,
and
maybe
it
doesn't
make
any
sense,
but
under
your
view
it
seems
to
me
it
really
just
isn't
even
on
the
statute
books.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
don't
have
to,
if
the
statute
means
what
you
says
it
does.
maybe
you
do
out
of
your...
you
know,
the
goodness
of
your
heart
to
try
and
cooperate
with
what
congress
would
like
you
to
do,
but
you
don't
have
to
under
your
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
a
fact
that
at
least
in
presidential
election
years
the
percentage
of
voter
turnout
at
the
primary
is
only
around
30
percent
or
so,
whereas
the
percentage
of
turnout
at
the
november
election
is
in
the
fifties
and
sixties
percent?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
does
make
a...
perhaps
make
a
difference
to
the
outcome
of
the
election
if
you
have
a
very
low
turnout
in
one
time
and
a
very
high
turnout
in
the
other.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
1980
it
was
28
percent,
i
think,
in
1984,
31
percent,
and
at
the
general
election
was
over
50
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
would
they
do
that
with
or
without
putting
their
names
on
the
ballot
in
the
november
election?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
it's
much
of
a
change
if
you
simply
make
your
declaration
later
but
don't
let
anybody
vote
after
the
october
date.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
give
them--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
it
also
means
you
would
take
the
position
that
they
could
say
whoever
has
the
most
votes
in
the
primary
shall
be
the
only
candidate
whose
name
appears
on
the
november
ballot?
could
you
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
it's
not
under...
but
as
a
matter
of...
consistent
with
your
legal
position
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
federal
law
and
all
the
rest
of
it.
could
louisiana
enact
a
statute
that
said
the
person
who
has
the
highest
votes
in
the
primary
is
the
only
person
whose
name
may
appear
on
the
november
ballot.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
a
question...
we're
talking
about
a
lot
of
hypotheticals
here.
since
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case,
do
you
know
whether
or
not
the
louisiana
legislature
has
given
any
attention
to
what
remedy
it
might
provide
for
this,
or
are
they
just
sitting
waiting
for
us?
