justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
happens
if
the
other
one
wins?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
a
gets
a
majority
of
the
votes
in
the
primary,
and
then
we
put
their
names
on
the
ballot
again
in
november,
but
more
people
turn
out,
and
this
time
b
wins.
who's
elected?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
do
we
have
to
get
into
this
other
issue?
i
mean,
i
don't
know,
maybe
in
california
my
recollection
is
they
all
provided
for
writeins.
i
don't
know
whether
they
do
or
don't.
maybe
all
these
other...
i
don't
know
what
louisiana
will
do.
i
mean,
here
the
statute
says
now
a
candidate
who
receives
a
majority
of
the
vote
that's
cast
for
office
in
a
primary
election
is
elected.
now,
do
we
have
to
go
into
the
question
of
what
happens
if
that
is
illegal
under
the
statute
and
they
decide
to
fix
it
up
by
declaring
him
elected
or
not?
is
it
necessary
or
not
necessary
for
us
to
go
into
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
the
court
of
appeals
just
dealt
with
this
language,
so
if
they
decide
to
fix
it
up
through
this...
saying,
okay,
they
changed
the
words,
so
a
candidate
who
receives
the
majority
of
the
votes
cast
for
office
in
a
primary
election
will
have
his
name
placed
on
the
ballot
in
november
and
no
one
else
will,
and
there
are
no
write-ins.
if
that's
how
they
fix
it
up,
then
we
have
to
deal
with
this
question
we're
now
discussing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
mr.
baker,
did
i
understand
you
to
agree
with
me...
i
think
general
ieyoub
did...
that
when
you
have
the
two
things,
one
is
everybody
votes
in
this,
call
it
what
you
will,
in
this
thing,
and
to
be
in
the
running
you
must
run
in
this
thing,
that
whatever
label
you
put
on
it,
that
is
an
election,
unlike
a
primary,
where
only
democrats
can
vote
in
one,
republicans
can
vote
in
the...
they're
not
specific.
this
is
everybody
who
wants
to
vote
votes
in
this.
everybody
who
wants
to
run
runs
in
this.
what
is
that,
and
if
the
answer
is,
an
election,
then
you
have
a
conflict
with
the
federal
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
let
me
just...
are
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
you
are,
let
me
go
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
because
i
was
asking
seriously
whether
we
have
to
reach
it,
and
to
force
you
to
focus
on
it,
i'll
say,
now
we
are
writing
the
opinion
in
your
favor,
hypothetically,
and
we
come
to
the
section
where...
remember
the
alternative
i
gave
you
you
said
we
didn't
have
to
reach,
they
change
it,
all
right,
to
say
only
this
name
appears
on
the
ballot
and
no
write-ins?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
it
is
argued
that
it
would
be
fine
to
have
a
statute
that
says,
no
write-ins,
and
the
only
name
on
the
ballot,
and
that
this
statute
is
the
same,
but
that
argument
is
unconvincing,
because...
and
now
i
want
you
to
fill
in
the
blank.
[laughter]
that's
why
i'm
uncertain
whether
we
have
to
reach
it.
how
would
you
fill
in
the
blank?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
know...
have
you
looked
up,
or
do
you
know
how
many
states
other
than
louisiana
do
not
allow
write-ins
on
the
november
election?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
know
if
there
are
any
others?
is
it
common?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
are
other
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
other
states
that
don't
allow
write-ins
in
the
primaries?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well
then,
we
may
have
to
reach
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
problem.
i
can
understand
why
you'd
want
to
limit
it,
because
if
you
can
limit
it
any
way
at
all,
even
with
one
vote,
or
even
with
the
first
and
last,
you've
distinguished
your
case.
i
understand
that.
now
we
don't
have
to
reach
the
others.
but
what's
worrying
me
now
is
that
if
we
say
here
there
is
no
election,
it's
not
an
election,
then
there
may
be
x
other
states
that
suddenly
will
discover
they
don't
have
an
election
in
november
for
the
reason
that
it
is
more
than
theoretically
possible
that
both
parties
have
selected
the
same
nominee,
and
that's
what
is
driving
this
concern,
and
at
the
moment
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
it
seems
to
me
a
genuine
concern,
and
that's...
i
mean,
everybody's
asking
you
to
focus
on
it.
i
don't
want
to
give
up
before
getting
the
most
out
of
your
thought
on
this
that
i
can.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
if
hawaii
or
other
states
that
don't
have
write-ins
in
november
do
end
up
with
the
democratic
and
republican
parties
selecting
the
same
candidate,
that
their
election
will
be
invalid.
that's
your
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
well,
i...
then...
it
sounds
as
if
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
think
if
people
had
focused
on
this
we'd
have
a
few
briefs
here
from
other
states
that
would
be
concerned
about
it,
and
so
i'm
a
little
uncertain
what
to
do.
it
seems
to
me
it's
coming
up
for
the
first
time
now.
