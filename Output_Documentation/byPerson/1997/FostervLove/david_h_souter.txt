well,
it
does
conflict,
because
it
has
an
election
on
a
day
other
than
the
day
specified
by
the
federal
statute.
that's
why
we're
here.
isn't
that
a
clear
conflict?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
statute's
clear.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
unreasonable
about
it?
congress
has
decided
that
it
wants
the
election
to
occur
uniformly
on
a
given
day
in
november
throughout
the
united
states.
what's
unreasonable
about--
justice
david
h.
souter
--no,
you
don't
have
that.
your
election,
if
there
is
a
majority,
occurs
in
october,
not
in
november.
justice
david
h.
souter
there
is
no
constitutional
authority
on
the
part
of
congress
to
determine
the
time,
uniformly
throughout
the
country?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
us...
is
it
up
to
this
court
to
decide
whether
louisiana
has
acted
appropriately
in
determining
whether
a
pretty
clear
federal
statute
is
going
to
be
applied
or
not?
is
that
what
you're
asking
us
to
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
that
this
is
a
justiciable
controversy?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that--
--but
i
want
to
make
sure
i
understand
your
position.
your
position,
then,
is
not
really
an
argument
about
whether
the
statute
applies,
and
if
so,
how,
and
whether
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
it
and
the
louisiana
statute.
your
position
is
that
this
issue
really
does
not
belong
in
the
court.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
saying
one
thing
more.
you're
saying
there's
got
to
be
a...
how
shall
i
put
it
+/?
a
legally
unconditional
opportunity
for
voting
on
the
november
date.
that's
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
not
merely
a
possibility.
you're
saying
that
the
possibility
has
got
to
be
legally
unconditional.
now,
if
the
voters
make
a
choice,
as
in
the
earl
warren
case,
that
would
not
be
a
problem
under
your
criteria,
because
the
law
was
not
precluding
the
possibility
of
the
voting
that
you're
talking
about.
you're
saying
that
the
law
cannot
preclude
that
opportunity,
and
this
law
does
in
the
80
percent
of
the
cases.
isn't
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
you
had
a
scheme
in
which
the
louisiana
statute
said,
whoever
gets
a
majority
in
october
will
be
on
the
november
ballot
and
will
be
the
only
name
on
the
november
ballot,
and
there
will
be
no
write-ins,
but
unless
in
november
that
person
gets
at
least
one
vote,
that
person
will
not
or
cannot
be
elected,
would
that
satisfy
the
federal
law?
the
reason
i
ask
the
question
is,
i
think
what
you're
saying
is,
there's
got
to
be
voting
on
the
november
date
which
is
operative
to
elect,
and
in
my
silly
hypothetical
there
would
in
fact
be
voting
in
november
that
would
be
operative
to
elect,
and
so
that's
why
i'm
asking.
is
that
sort
of
the
nub
of
what
you're
arguing
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right.
nobody
votes
for
the
october
winner,
and
therefore
no
one
is
elected
for
that
office.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
reason
for
that?
are
you
saying
the
reason
is
there's
got
to
be
a
choice
as
between
at
least
two
candidates
on
that
date?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
at
least
an
opportunity
so
far
as
state
law
is
concerned
for
a
choice.
