mr.
m.
miller
baker
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
key
issue
in
this
case,
your
honors,
is
that
this
is
not
an
attack
on
louisiana's
prerogative
to
maintain
this
type
of
election
system.
justice
ginsburg
got
it
exactly
right.
louisiana
can
maintain
what
it
has,
but
it
has
to
conform
it
to
the
requirements
of
federal
law,
and
that
would
mean
this
primary,
which
is
really
an
election,
on
federal
election
day,
with
a
run-off
thereafter
as
required
by
section
8.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
well,
it...
justice
kennedy,
with
respect
to
the
former,
the
hypothetical
you
gave
me,
the
federal
statute
requires
that
any
runoff
election
be
held
at
some
point
after
the--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--and
the
fact
that
turnout
may
be
lower
is
inconsequential
to
the
federal
statutory
scheme.
that's
just
a
fact
of
life,
and
that...
we
saw
that
in
georgia
in
1992,
where
georgia
had
an
election
for
the
united
states
senate
in
which
no
candidate
obtained
a
majority
of
the
vote
in
november
and
there
was
a
run-off
thereafter,
at
which
point
the
turnout
was
actually
lower.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
not
at
all,
justice
kennedy,
and...
not
at
all,
because
the
real
election,
the
de
jure
election,
is
in
fact
still
on--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--if
there's
no
opportunity
to
cast...
if
there's
no
possibility
for
a
choice
on
federal
election
day,
louisiana
has
foreclosed
an
election
on
federal
election
day,
and
it's
legally
impossible--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
if--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--state
law
has
to
provide
for
the
possibility
of
an
election.
that
is,
there
has
to
be
the
possibility
of
an
election
on
federal
election
day.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--that's
correct.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
i
have...
well--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your
honor,
the
statute
doesn't
say
you
can
have
an
election
for
federal
office
only
20
percent
of
the
time.
it
says
in
every
federal
election
the
election
must
occur
on--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--an
election,
justice--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--the
state
has
provided
for
the
possibility--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--a
possibility
is
sufficient
as
long
as
state
law
hasn't
foreclosed--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--where
both
parties
have
nominated
the
same--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
if...
well,
there's
an
election
to
the
extent
that
state
law
provided
for
the
possibility
of
more
than
one
person
being
on
the
ballot.
an
election
was
provided
for.
through
the
state's
ballot
access
rules,
only
one
person
appeared
to
qualify
for--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--that's
not
correct,
justice
scalia.
through
louisiana's...
louisiana's
primary
is
not
a
qualifying
primary.
it
elects
members
of
congress
in
october.
only
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
failure
to
elect
in
the
louisiana
primary
is,
in
fact,
there
an
election
in
october.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's...
it's
not
a
question
of
timing
or
certification,
justice
kennedy.
it's
a
question
of
the
timing
of
the
election
that
selects
the
member
for
office.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
on--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--no,
justice
kennedy.
justice
kennedy,
louisiana
has
a
conclusive
election
in
its
october
primary.
the
voters--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--but--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--because
the--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--your--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--no,
it's--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--no,
justice
o'connor.
in
response
to
your
hypotheticals,
those
are
all
situations
in
which
the
party
primaries
are
not
conclusive
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
party
primaries
have
merely
nominated
a
person
who
may
appear
on
the
november
ballot.
the
louisiana
october
primary
is
conclusive
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
if
it's
not
possible,
if
it's
not
legally
possible
for
the
winner
of
the
primary
in
october
to
lose
in
november,
if
it's
not...
if
a
state
doesn't
allow
for
some
other
candidate
to
appear
on
that
ballot,
if
by
winning
that
october
primary
you
have
won
the
election,
that...
you're
selected
for
office,
that's
the
violation
of
the
federal
statute.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
but
that
satisfies
federal
law
because
those
primaries,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
were
not
conclusive.
they
did
not
select,
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
person
for
congress.
a
primary,
as
traditionally
understood,
merely
selects
a
person
to
appear
on
a
ballot,
either
a
partisan
nominee,
or
otherwise
serves
the
function
of...
it's
a
ballot
access
funnel,
and
it
winnows
down
the
number
of
candidates
who
will
ultimately
appear
on
a
general
election
ballot,
but
it
doesn't
select
members
of
congress.
an
election
does,
and
that's
the
crucial--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--justice
scalia,
we
don't--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--the
difference
is,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
hypotheticals
you
gave
me,
the
two...
there
are
two
partisan
primaries.
the
part...
that
each
provide
a
place
on
the
ballot.
neither
primary
is
conclusive
as
a
matter
of
law.
this
louisiana
october
primary
is
conclusive,
and
merely
delaying
the--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
it's
not...
justice
scalia,
that's
not
an
election,
because
there's
not
the
possibility...
state
law
has
not
allowed
for...
assuming
there's
no
write-in
possibility,
what
section
7
requires
is
an
election
on
federal
election
day,
which--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--absolutely,
justice
souter.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
it's
not
necessary,
justice
breyer.
a
declaratory...
affirming
the
court
of
appeals,
and
the
declaratory
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
as
satisfactory,
then
it
will
be
the
prerogative
of
the--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--absolutely,
justice
breyer.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
i
wouldn't
object
to
that,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
the
reasons
that
i
would
provide
is
that
the
state
statute
is
in
hopeless
conflict
with
federal
law.
federal
law
requires
a
uniform
national
date
for
congressional
elections,
louisiana
law
provides
for
conclusive
congressional
elections
in
october
that
cannot
be
reconciled--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--absolutely,
justice
ginsburg,
which
leads
me
to
respond
to
a
point
made
by
my
colleague,
the
attorney
general.
the
attorney
general
suggested
that
partisan
primaries
were
unknown
in
1872,
and
he's
absolutely
right,
so
this
is
not
a
situation
of
applying
old
law
to
new
facts.
we're
applying
old
law
to,
in
fact,
an
election
system
that
congress
exactly
understood
at
the
time
it
enacted
this
statute.
congress...
in
1872
there
were
elections.
there
were
no
pre-election
primaries.
but
congress
also
anticipated
that
states
in
these
elections
might
have
majority
vote
requirements.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
yes.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
correct.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
the
argument
is
unconvincing
because
the
election
that
selected
the
member
for
office
was
held
in
october,
and
there
was
no
election
in
november,
justice
breyer.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's...
maybe
i
misunderstood
justice
breyer's
question.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that
would
not
comply
with
the
federal--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--that's...
there
are
numerous
correct,
justice
ginsburg...
there
are
numerous
possibilities
for
fixing
this
system
so
that
it--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--it
would
be...
well,
under
your
hypothetical
it
would
be
legally
possible
to
be
elected
or
not
be
elected
if
a
candidate
did
receive
a
vote,
as
i
understand
your
hypothetical.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
which
is
distinguished
from
most...
all
right,
under
that...
if
state
law
were
as
you
posited
it,
justice
souter,
and
it
would
only
take
one
vote
to
elect
this
person,
this
person
was
on
the
ballot,
there
would
be
an
election
on
federal
election
day,
but
it
would
not...
there
would
be
serious,
profound
questions
raised
whether
or
not
this
election
satisfied
this
court's
first
and
fourteenth
amendment
jurisprudence--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--an
election,
by
definition,
presupposes
a
choice.
that's--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--correct,
justice
souter.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
but
what
has
happened...
two
separate
primaries
that
have
elected
the
same
nominee--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--the
state
law
has
not
prevented
that
choice,
justice
scalia.
it's
the
choice
of
the
voters
in
a
preceding...
state
law
has
allowed
for
the
possibility
of
an
election
in
november.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
the
difference,
justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the...
that
those
primaries,
neither
primary
elected
as
a
matter
of
right
the
person
to
office.
each
primary
merely
selected
a
person
who
happened
to
be
the
same
person
to
appear
on
that
ballot.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
because
the
state
law
has
provided
for
its
conclusive
election
in
november.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
yes,
justice
stevens,
they
looked
at
this
in
the
most
recent
legislative
session.
there
were
some
efforts
to
address
the
problem,
and
then
they
decided
apparently
to
wait
until
this
court's
disposition
of
this
case,
so
the
legislation
went
nowhere.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
justice
breyer.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
i
know
that
hawaii
doesn't
allow--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--does
not
allow
write-in--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--that's--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
section
8--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--absolutely,
justice
scalia.
that
would
satisfy...
there
would
be
an
election.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
there'd
be
an
election.
now,
whether
or
not
that
election--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--if--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--there...
well,
not
anything,
justice
scalia.
there
has
to
be
the...
as
long
as
there
is
the
possibility
for
a
choice
in
november--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
justice
breyer,
if
a
state's
ballot
access
selection
device
is
not
conclusive
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
ballot
access
selection
device
in
the
form
of
a
primary
would
pass
muster
under
the
federal
statutes.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
that's
not
my
position,
justice--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--well,
justice
breyer,
that--
mr.
m.
miller
baker
--that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
for
the
added
reason
that
those
party
primaries
don't
as
a
matter
of
law
select
the
congressional
officer.
they
simply
have
selected
a
nominee
who
will
appear
on
a
ballot,
and
if
by
happenstance
the
same
person
has
been
chosen
by
the
respective
democratic
and
republican
primaries,
the
election
is
still
held
in...
the
conclusive
election
is
held
in
november,
and
the
primaries
were
not
legally...
were
not
the
legal
selection
of
the
congressional
officer.
mr.
m.
miller
baker
correct.
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
section
8,
the
companion
statute
to
section
7,
2
u.s.c.
section
8,
is
a
statute
that
answers
this...
that
gives
us
the
answer
in
this
case.
elections
in
1872
were
like
the
elections
that
louisiana
has
today.
everybody
appeared
at
the
polls.
everybody
voted.
in
most
states,
a
plurality
election
was
sufficient
to
elect
a
person
to
congress,
but
a
number
of
states
have
majority
vote
requirements
as
does
louisiana
today,
so
therefore
congress
inserted
section
8
into
title
2
to
provide
for
the
contingency
of
a
failure
to
elect
on
federal
election
day,
and
that's
the
statute
that
louisiana
could
follow
and
have
its
post
federal
election
day
run-off
if
it
so
chose
to
do
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
