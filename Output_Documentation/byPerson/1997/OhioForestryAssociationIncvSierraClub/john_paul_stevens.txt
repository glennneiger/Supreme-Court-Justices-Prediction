justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i
ask
just
sort
of
a
background
question?
i'm
a
little
confused
about
the
whole...
as
i
understand
it,
about...
most
of
the
land
in
the
national...
in
this
forest
is
owned
privately.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
the
clearcutting
and
the
timber
that's
cut
down,
is
that
all
on
private
land,
or
is
that
on
public
land?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
only
federally
owned
land?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
about
80
percent
of
the
forest,
the
plan
just
doesn't
apply
to?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
plan
itself
just
regulates
activities
on
government
owned
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
only
about
20
percent
of
the
total
forest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
would
you
take
that
position
if
the
statute
said
in
so
many
words,
or
at
least
there
was
a
reasonable
legal
argument
for
saying
clearcutting
shall
be
prohibited,
period?
would
they
have
a
right
to
challenge
a
plan
that
authorized
clearcutting
if
the
statute
clearly,
or
at
least
arguably
prohibited
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
mean
you're
just
close.
you
could
challenge
that
plan,
couldn't
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
said
no
clearcutting
at
all
you
don't
think
you
could
challenge
that
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
plan
didn't
say
no
clearcutting
at
all,
did
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
that
case--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--no.
but
you
suggest
you
wouldn't
have
standing
if
they
said
you
could
never
cut
timber
in
this
forest?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
wouldn't
just
say
a
cautious
court,
a
principled
court
should
do
that,
shouldn't
it?
[laughter]
