would
you
be
saying
the
same
thing
if
it
were
the
timber
companies
complaining
and
saying
this
plan
doesn't
reserve
enough
land
for
timber
harvesting,
it
gives
over
too
much
land
to
other
uses
and
excludes
harvesting?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gittes,
didn't
this
motivating
course
for
all
this
begin
with
a
statute
that
said...
didn't
the
sixth
circuit
said,
under
this
statute
that
puts
the
agency
and
the
logging
companies
in
bed
with
each
other?
isn't
that
in
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
opinion
of
the
court
is
driven
by
the
arrangement
under
this
statute
that
makes
the
agency
relationship
with
the
regulated
party
very
close,
and
that's
hardly
unique
to
this
kind
of--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
this
particular
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
nothing
may
change
from
what
is,
and
i
suppose
this
is
the
problem
lurking
behind
all
of
this.
there
may
be
some
things
that
will
immediately
injure
somebody
in
this
plan,
or...
but
you're
coming
to
a
court
which
this
abstract
challenge.
you
say,
court,
go
over
the
whole
thing.
there's
lots
of
problems
with
this,
and
it's
sort
of
a
super...
you're
putting
the
court
as
the
superadministrator
over
an
agency
when
nothing
is
done,
has
been
done,
and
courts,
you
know,
are
accustomed
to
thinking
small,
to
having
a
concrete
case
where
somebody
is
hurt
or
is
about
to
be
hurt,
but
this
sprawling,
what...
first
it's
clearcutting
and
then
it's
the
motorcycles
and
the
birds.
it's
just
everything,
and
that's
kind
of
overwhelming
for
a
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
even
if
you
were
right
about
that,
couldn't
a
court
just
say
what,
essentially,
this
district
court
did.
the
district
court
didn't
throw
it
out
on
justiciability.
it
looked
it
over
and
it
said,
we
have
to
be
extremely
deferential
to
an
agency
at
this
just
going
in
threshold
stage.
now,
you
have
conceded
that
the
bias
part,
the
sixth
circuit
shouldn't
have
said...
i
think
you
said
that...
that
this
is
not
a
dishonest,
corrupt
agency,
so
if
you
got
to
the
merits
at
this
abstract
stage,
wouldn't
the
agency
be
owed
the
utmost
deference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where...
the
paragraphs
in
the
complaint
that
show
its
heart
are
which
paragraphs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that...
it's...
now
you're
telling
us
is
not
that
part
of
it.
you
say,
this
is
the
heart...
if
i
were
to
look
at
this
entire
complaint,
i
would
find
the
heart,
the
heartbeats,
so
i
want
to
know
where
i'm
going
to
find
the
heart
of,
not
this
part,
because
you're
shifting.
is
it
the
heart
of
the
whole
case,
or
just
part
of
the
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
okay.
where
do
i
find
in
this
complaint
the
heart
of
the
whole
case?
