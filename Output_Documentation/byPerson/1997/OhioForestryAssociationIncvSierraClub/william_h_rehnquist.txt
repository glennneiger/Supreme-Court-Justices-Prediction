chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
97-16,
ohio
forestry
association
v.
sierra
club.
mr.
stewart.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
this
action
brought
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
quarles,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
your
position
is
something
like
that
of
the
petitioner
here
in
that
asarco
case
that
we
decided
several
years
ago,
where
perhaps
at
the
beginning
you
didn't
have
standing
but
once
the
court
rules
that
there
can
be
no
cutting
at
all,
then
you
certainly
do
have
standing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
quarles,
you
don't
have
too
much
more
time.
why
was
the
bias
ruling
wrong?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
quarles.
mr.
gittes,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
gittes,
do
you
defend
the
bias
ruling
of
the
sixth
circuit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
a
proper
bias
analysis,
to
say
that
the
agency
here
came
down
in
favor
of
one
side
rather
than
another,
therefore
it
must
be
legally
biased
in
the
sense
of
just,
forever
slanted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
mr.
gittes,
if
you
read
2a
at
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari,
the
first
part
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
which
is
telling
what
the
quote
is
about,
the
second
paragraph
says
we're
talking
about
clearcutting,
even...
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
anything
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well
then,
you're
in
effect
asking
us
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
on
an
alternate
ground.
you're
not
really
defending
what
the
court
of
appeals
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
talked
about
that
in
the
context
of
timbering
and
clearcutting,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
excuse
me--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
file
it
with
the
clerk,
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
