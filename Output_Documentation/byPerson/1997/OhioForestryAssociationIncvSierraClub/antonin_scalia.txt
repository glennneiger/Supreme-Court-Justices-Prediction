justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
a
provision
that
would
have
immediate
impact?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
difference
is
that
in
the
case
posited
by
justice
ginsburg
it
is
clear
that
no
harvesting
will
occur.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereas
here
it
is
not
clear
that
harvesting
will
occur.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
claim
that
they
use
the
entire
forest?
that
would
cover
that
problem,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
how
could
you
ever
come
to
a
determination
in
a
single
suit
that
the
overall
plan
level
is
irrational?
the
government
will
come
in
and
say,
well,
even
if
we
did
set
aside
too
much
for
logging
activity,
had
we
set
aside
less,
we
still
might
have
decided
that
this
was
the
tract
that
we
were
going
to
log
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
go
to
the
whole
plan,
though,
just
to
allowing
that
area
to
be
logged.
it
would
be
very
hard,
it
seems
to
me,
in
any
individual
case
to
challenge
the
overall
determination
that
x
number
of
acres
should
be
logged.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
concede
that
there
has
to
be
some
mechanism
for
reviewing
the
whole
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
every
governmental
determination,
no
matter
how
high
the
level
of
generality
at
which
it
is
made,
must
be
subject
to
judicial
review?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
claiming
the
ability
to
challenge
the
proposition
that
there
can
be
no
plan,
which
is
to
say
there
can
be
no
timber
sales
in
this
area.
you're
not
claiming
that
this
particular
plan
has
to
be
brought
back
in...
i
mean,
the
source
of
your
injury
is
not
that
the...
every
jot
and
tittle
of
this
plan
isn't
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
rather
that
the
court
has
held
no
plan
at
all,
that
is
to
say
no
timber
sales
at
all--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
the
sierra
club
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
you
are
if
the
plan
said
this
entire
area
will
be
clearcut.
would
you
acknowledge
that
the
sierra
club
would
have
standing
in
that
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
is
the
opposite
of
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
optimality?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
really
said
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
by
extrajudicial
circumstances.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
we
can't
say
anything
about
all
this
if
we
agree
with
your
first
point,
that
there's
no
ripeness
here
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
district
courts
in
the
sixth
circuit
continue
to
believe
it
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
all
of
that
would
prove
a
very...
if
it
were
all
true,
a
very
bad
decision,
but
is
every
very
bad
decision
biased?
does...
i
mean,
my
goodness,
we
really
have
an
awful
lot
of
disqualified
judges
if
every
time--
[laughter]
--we
found
a
decision
really
wrong
we
said
this
is
a
biased
judge.
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
an
established
bias.
that...
i
mean,
that
shows
that
it's
wrong
and
can
be
reversed
by
a
court,
but
every
time
an
agency
can
be
reversed
by
a
court
as
being
arbitrary
and
capricious,
does
that
mean
the
agency
has
been
biased?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
of
this
court
in
which,
on
the
basis
of
the
judgment
below
of
an
agency
or
of
a
court,
just
on
the
basis
of
how
wrong
the
judgment
was,
this
court
has
said
that
the
agency
or
the
court
was
biased?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
on
the
basis
of
what
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
guts
of
your
complaint
was
number...
was
paragraph
23
on
page
139a,
the
plan
adopted
by
the
defendants
is
unlawful
and
arbitrary
and
capricious
because
among
other
reasons,
then
it
goes
down
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
and
f,
all
of
which
refer
to
timber
harvesting.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly
would
have
been
surprised
if
i
had
been
served
with
this
complaint,
you
know,
to
have
to
come
in
and
defend
the
exclusion
of
motor...
the
admission
of
motorcyclists.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
have
said,
where
did
this
come
from?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your...
it
seems
to
me
the
premise
of
your
argument
is
that
every
governmental
decision
needs
to
be
reviewable
immediately,
and
that...
let's
assume
the
fcc
decides
that
it's...
we
are
going
to
have
no
more
than
5,000
radio
stations
per
state,
and
let's
assume
that
no
state
currently
has
any
more
than
3,000.
now,
that
may
be
a
very
stupid
policy
for
the
fcc
to
adopt,
but
unless
there's...
unless
there's
some
special
provision
for
immediate
judicial
review,
do
you
think
that
that
generalized
determination
could
be
immediately
reviewable
when
nobody
is
affected
by
it
immediately?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
may
be
a
very
stupid
policy.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
but
if
and
when
they
go
beyond
what
you
think
the
amount
of
the
area
that
should
have
been
allowed
for
clearcutting,
then
certainly
that
whole
issue
would
come
up.
for
example,
if
you
think
it's
arbitrary
and
capricious
to
allow
any
clearcutting
at
all,
then
the
very
first
logging
enter...
attempt
would
enable
you
to
challenge
that
portion
of
the
general
plan
which
allows
any
clearcutting,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you'll
be
able
to
challenge
it
as
soon
as
they
allow
clearcutting.
justice
antonin
scalia
wildlife
what?
i
didn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--openings.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
do
they
build
those
trails
before
the
timber
cut
is
approved?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
come
in
and
say,
we
want
no
clearcutting
at
all,
zero
clearcutting,
we
want
zero
wildlife
openings,
we
want
zero...
zero
roads?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
you
came
in
with
all
of
that,
then
i
suppose
any
plan
would
immediate...
and
your
people
used
all
of
the
forest,
i
suppose
any
plan
would
immediately
affect
you.
was
that
your...
you
really
think
that
they
couldn't
have
provided
for
any
timbering
at
all,
or
any
wildlife--
justice
antonin
scalia
--was
that
your
contention
below,
that
no
timber--
justice
antonin
scalia
--at
all
should
be
allowed
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
--chief
justice,
could
i
ask--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
paragraph
of
the
complaint,
because
you
first
said
the
nepa
thing
was
25.
it
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--47?
is
there
a
47?
no,
there
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
end
at
42.
