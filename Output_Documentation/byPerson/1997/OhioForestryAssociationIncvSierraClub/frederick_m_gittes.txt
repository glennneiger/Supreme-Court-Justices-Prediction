mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
yes,
i
do,
because
the
bias
ruling
is
based
on
the
factual
record.
if
you
read
the
opinion,
you'll
notice
the
court
says,
this
plan
was
biased,
let
us
give
you
some
examples
of
why,
and
then
proceeds
to
discuss
the
heart
of
the
merits
of
this
case,
which
is
that
the
forest
service
violated
the
primary
obligation
under
the
act.
that
obligation
is
to
come
up
with
a
plan
that
maximizes
the
net
public
benefit.
they
didn't
do
that
in
this
case,
because
they
only
protected
10
percent
of
this
forest
for
recreational
users
like
the
respondents.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
specifically
what
the
court
illustrated
is
as
follows.
this
plan,
they
fail
to
explain
or
even
analyze
their
own
expert's
warning
to
them
that
they
were
greatly...
and
i
use
the
expert's
word...
greatly
undervaluing
the
demand
for
hiking
and
recreation
in
this
forest.
two,
the
basis...
as
pointed
out
in
the
court
below
there
was
a
distorted
view
of
the
forest,
and
that
included--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
this
opinion
was
not
based
on
that
discussion
and
we
know
that
because
of
the
concurrence.
we
have
a
judge
below
who
concurred
that
this
plan
was
illegal
and
did
not
concur
in
any
of
the
analysis
about
the
statute.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--i'm
sorry.
i
absolutely
do
not
believe
the
opinion
was
driven
by
that
language.
if
you
follow
the
structure
of
the
opinion,
first
they
discuss
how
they
failed
to
analyze
the,
or
assign
any
values
to
the
detrimental
effect
of
timbering
on
other
recreational
uses.
they
discuss
the
undervaluation,
cautioned
by
their
own
experts,
that
they
ignored,
they
talk
about
how
the
whole
purpose
of
the
plan's
timbering
program
was
to
generate
more
animals
like
deer,
skunks,
squirrels,
possums,
of
which
there
is
an
overpopulation
in
the
area.
in
fact,
it's
causing
a
major
problem
in
southeast--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--well,
your
honor,
the
standard
under
the
apa,
as
this
court
knows,
it's
not
enough
just
to
be
wrong.
it
has
to
be
arbitrary
and
capricious,
and
this
court--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
i'm
not
going
to
sit
here
and
say
that
the
word
bias
is
always
an
equivalent
of
arbitrary
and
capricious.
all
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
is
that
what
generated
that
conclusion
in
this
case,
and
if
you
read
the
opinion
it's
clear,
was
the
factual
record,
the
erroneous
assumptions
made
by
the
forest
service,
the
disregard
for
their
own
experts,
the
absurdity
of
justifying
a
timber
program
to
have
more
deer
when
all
the
communities
in
that
area
are
complaining
about--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
no.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
i
do
not
know
of
one,
and
i--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--i
believe
the
sixth
circuit's
intent
was
to
say
the
plan
was
biased,
and
i
believe
that's
their
wording.
they
did
go
on
in
the
majority
opinion
to
discuss
the
statutory
framework
as
to
a
factor
that
might
have
been
an
explanation
which
led
them
to
disregard
their
own
experts.
that
part
we
don't
defend.
we
do
believe
that
was
dicta,
and
that's
highlighted
by
the
concurrence.
but
one
other
point
i
want
to
emphasize
here,
to
really
understand
this
whole
case
the
court
needs
to
understand
what
it
is,
the
injury
that
led
to
this
case.
this
case
arose
because
forest
service
administrators
only
protected
10
percent
of
the
only
national
forest
in
the
state
of
ohio,
the
sixth
most
populous
state
in
this
country,
for
this
kind
of
back
packing,
undisturbed
recreational
use.
now,
that
is
the
same
kind
of
decision
that
the
government
has
conceded
in
their
brief
creates
an
injury,
in
this
respect.
the
government
has
conceded
that
a
decision
not
to
close
roads,
for
example,
or
as
mentioned
earlier,
a
decision
to
close
off
a
forest
area
to
offroad
vehicle
use,
is
an
injury
that's
being
inflicted.
this
plan
inflicted
that
injury
when
they
basically
said,
we
will
not
close
off
more
of
this
forest
from
a
wide
range
of
activities--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--no,
your
honor,
it's
not
the
nub.
it's
one
of
the
most
graphic
features
of
it,
but
it's
not
the
nub.
our
con--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
it's
not--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--well,
your
honor,
this
case
has
always
been
about
one
principal
issue
how
much
of
this
very
small
forest,
extremely
small,
one
of
the
smallest
in
the
country,
is
going
to
be
protected
for
back
country
hiking.
in
fact,
in
technical
terms
this
was
about
designating
more
of
the
forest,
in
forest
service
jargon,
6.2.
well,
that
has
a
specific
meaning,
your
honor.
that
means
none
of
these
other
activities.
that's
what
it
means,
and--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor
will
find
it--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--yes--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
if
you
take
a
look
at
tab
100
of
the
administrative
appeal
of
the
citizen's
council--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--yes.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
yes.
your
honor,
in
the
complaint
itself,
i
believe
it
is
paragraph
25
talks
about
nepa
violations.
that
allegation
was
based
upon
one
principal
argument
that
not
enough
alternatives
made
allowances
for
larger
areas
of
protected
6.2...
in
other
words,
back
country
hiking.
we
also
specifically
address
in
paragraph
20
of
the
complaint
the
failure
to
consider
the
road
situation
properly.
we
also
in
our
briefing
extensively
discuss
the
problem
of
undervaluation
of
the
demand
for
back
country
hiking.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
it
does
not
specifically
specify
the
uses
that
are
interfered
with.
it
specifies
that
the
plan
failed
to
consider
the
impact
of
these
roads
on
the
uses
of
the
plaintiffs
and
in
the
first
allegations,
early
allegations
in
the
complaint
we
set
out
the
uses
of
the
plaintiff.
we
describe
the--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
and
i
don't
want
to
back
off
of
the
timber
issue
because
i
believe
we
have
clear
standing
and
ripeness
on
that
as
well,
and
we'll
get
back
to
it
in
a
moment,
but
this
case
was
always
about
one
principal
issue,
how
much
of
the
forest
was
going
to
be
protected
from
a
wide
range
of
activities.
the
very
first--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
that
is
one
portion
of
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
but
there
are
other
allegations
regarding,
for
example,
the
nepa
violation
that
stands
in
a
separate
paragraph
unrelated
to
that
and
that
nepa
violation,
as
briefed
in
the
court
below,
was
concerned
with
not
having
enough
alternatives
with
more
land
protected
for
back
country
hiking.
there's...
from
the
very
beginning--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--i
don't
mean
to
focus
on
motorcycles.
the
very
first
filing
in
the
administrative
record
of
substance--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--perhaps--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--i'm
sorry,
paragraph
47,
your
honor.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
there's
no
question
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
timbering
as
being
the
primary
injury
here--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--and
then
the
most
graphic
injury,
because--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--no,
your
honor.
the
one
thing
the
court
of
appeals
did,
besides
talk
about
timbering,
is
how
this
plan
failed
to
properly
consider
the
demand
for
recreational
uses
of
the
forest.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
it
did
in
terms
of
timber,
but
it
also
talked
about
it
in
terms
of
the
forest
service
simply
not
valuating
properly
the
demand
for
these
other
uses.
but
even
as
to
the
timber
program,
your
honor,
there
clearly
is
standing
in
this
case.
this...
there
is
no
question,
under
a
plan
like
this,
there
will
be
timbering.
this
is
not...
the
government
may
be
correct
that...
as
to
where
and
when
the
timbering
will
occur,
but
there
is
no
question
that
there
will--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--yes,
there
is,
your
honor,
and
we
believe
not
only
is
the
plan,
the
timing
of
this
case
the
best
time
for
challenging
plan
decisions
which
are
unlawful,
but
it
may
be
the
only
time,
because
in
fact
the
government
has
maintained
a
mantra
in
the
courts
below
that
goes
like
this.
it's
either
not
ripe,
or
it's
not
relevant.
it's
not
ripe
because
you're
too
early,
or
you
haven't
exhausted
your
administrative
appeals,
the
plan
isn't
finalized.
now,
we
waited
till
we
had
exhausted
our
administrative
appeals
required
by
the
government's
regulations
in
this
case.
now,
when
you
go
to
tie
up
a
project
the
government's
position
has
been
highlighted
in
the
icl
v.
mumma
case
that,
well,
wait
a
minute,
this
project
only
has
to
do
with
deciding
whether
this
location
fits
the
plan's
conditions
and
serves
the
objectives
of
the
plan.
it
does
not
involve
any
review
of
the
balancing
act,
the
trade
offs,
the
multiuse
determination
which
is
the
core
of
all
plans.
therefore,
it's
not
really
raised
by
the
project.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
well,
if
no
one
claims
to
have
wanted
to
open
a
station
in
one
of
the
states
that
were
barred
from
having
a
station,
you're
right,
there
would
be
no
standing,
but
in
light
of
someone
like--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--yes,
your
honor,
but
here
we
have
a
situation
where
the
plan
creates
the
injury.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
well,
your
honor,
our
complaint
is
not
just
with
timber,
it's
with
a
wide
range
of
activities,
including
roadwork,
road
reconstruction,
and
many
of
those--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--well,
in...
the
plans...
this
plan
would
be
purposeless.
it
would
be
a
meaningless
exercise
taking
years
of
energy,
millions
of
dollars,
if
the
plan
wasn't
going
to
try
to
accomplish
its
objectives.
its
objectives.
for
example,
since
the
court
has
focused
on
timbering,
although
i
think
that
it's
not
the
heart
of
this
case,
which
is--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--that's
all
right.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
well,
your
honor,
this
is
not
a
typical
government
decision,
in
the
sense
that
number
1
the
very
purpose
of
nfma
is
served
by
having
review
of
the
plan
at
the
earliest
stage
possible.
secondly,
this...
by
law,
this
plan
is
to
set
the
objectives
for
the
forest
and
these
objectives,
whether
it's
having
more
orv
or
timbering
to
generate
more
deers,
whether
it's
to
have
more
hiking
area,
can
never
be
achieved
unless
what
the
plan
suggests
be
done
be
done.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
it's
not
a
problem
is
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
first
injury
is
inflicted
the
moment
the
plan
is
finalized,
because
that
injury
is,
they
haven't
closed
off
more
of
the
forest.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
first
of
all,
the
heart
of
the
injury
here,
i
have
to
emphasize,
is
not
having
more
area
protected.
that's
the
claim.
for
the
state
of
ohio,
this
is
a...
this
forest
is
so
small,
to
give
you
an
idea,
it's
a...
if
you
put
it
all
together
in
a
square,
it's
about
20
by
15
miles
square.
you
can
hike
this
whole
forest,
across
it,
in
a
day.
the
respondents,
as
put
out
in
the
administrative
record,
made
clear,
live
in
this
area.
they
use
it
every
day.
now,
let
me
address
the
issue
of
too
big
a
decision.
the
real
decision
here
and
that
we're
arguing
about
is
that
basic
decision,
the
equation
that
led
to
so
little
of
this
forest,
which
is
a
unique
resource
for
the
state
of
ohio,
being
made
available
for
back
country
hiking.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
the
agency
is
owed
deference
but
not
absolute
deference,
obviously,
as
this
court
has
emphasized,
motor
vehicles
manufacturing
association
being
a
good
example.
a
close
look
at
this
record,
as
i
was
trying
to
indicate
earlier,
shows
the
classic
indicators
of
arbitrariness.
when
an
agency
completely
fails
to
explain
or
even
analyze
a
warning
from
their
own
experts,
when
an
agency
violates
its
own
regulations
and
fails
to
factor
in
the
negative
impact
of
timbering,
when
an
agency
justifies
a
timbering
program
to
get
more
deer
when
their
own
regulations
say
you've
got
to
consider
what's
surrounding
the
forest
and
there's
a
deer
problem
throughout
the
private
holdings
around
the
forest,
that
reaches
a
level
of
arbitrariness
under
this
court's
standard,
even
with
deference.
and
to
get
back
to
the
injury
question
on
ripeness,
the
reality
of
the
situation
is,
this
plan
is
being
implemented.
we're
not
dealing
with
a
plan
attack
where
nothing
has
happened.
secondly,
the
plan
will
be
meaningless
unless
they
do
do
things.
third,
as
justice
scalia
emphasized,
and
i
think
it's
critical
in
this
case,
this
is
not
like
the
nwf
case.
this
is
not
2
million
acres.
this
place
is
so
small
that
literally,
as
indicated
in
the--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
if
literally
this
court
were
to
rule
that
the
entire
multiuse
analysis,
which
means
factoring
in
total
demand
for
recreation,
for
hiking,
total
demand
for
hunting,
total
demands
for
wildlife
preservation,
total
demands
for
timbering,
that
whole
equation
and
balancing
that
goes
on
in
a
plan
can
be
reviewed
in
the
context
of
a
single
timber
project,
then
that
would
lead
to
the
review
that
we're
seeking.
the
problem
is
and
the
reality
is
that
the
record
concerning
the
plan
has
been
completed.
the
siting
of
a
particular
timber
sale
is
not
what
we're
concerned
about.
we're
not
concerned
about
that
tree
over
there,
or
that
tree
over
there.
we're
concerned
with
how
much
of
the
total
area
is
going
to
be
protected
from
any
timbering.
and
i
have
to
emphasize
this.
perhaps
i
can
get
this
one
point
across.
timbering
is
being
viewed
here--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
that
is
our
position,
basically,
that
this
is
such
a
small
forest
and
such
a
unique
resource
that
there
should
be
none
of
these
kinds
of
activities--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
i
could
go
tomorrow
to
the
courthouse
and
file
a
complaint
which
has
added
to
it
a
count
that
project
x
is...
violates
the
plan
and
use
it
to
bootstrap
a
plan
attack.
here's
why
that
makes
no
sense,
at
least
to
me.
number
1,
the
factors
that
go
into
that
siting
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
plan
decision.
all
that
you
do
in
a
project
level
is
decide,
does
this
meet
the
plan's
standards,
will
it
meet
the
plan's
goal.
you
don't
even
consider
the
big
questions
that
the
plan
had
already
decided.
second--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--if
this
court
clearly
and
unequivocally
were
to
allow
that,
that
would
solve
part
of
the--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
but
in
the
context
of
that
project
challenge,
in
order
to
challenge
the
plan
we're
going
to
have
to
be
discussing
a
lot
more
than
just
timber
and
even
the
timber
base.
we're
going
to
have
to
discuss
recreational
demand,
we're
going
to
have
to
discuss
all
the
cost
benefit
analysis
that
fill
up
the
whole
book
of
the
planning
records
here,
because
it
isn't
just
a
matter
of
deciding
about
the
timbering
issue
that
leads
to
the
timbering,
because
it's
a
balance
of
every
use
of
the
forest,
and
the
particulars
of
that
sale
have
nothing
to
do
with
that
balancing
act.
it
only
occurs
at
the
plan
level,
and
the
administrative
record
is
complete,
and
our
other--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
the--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--the
reasons
we
don't
think
that
ripeness
in
this
case
calls
for
tying
it
to
a
particular
project
is
twofold.
first
of
all,
because
the
project
specifics
do
not
illuminate,
they
aren't
really
relevant
to
the
larger
plan
decisions,
secondly
the
whole
purpose
of
nfma
is
to
get
a
plan
and
get
it
clarified
as
early
as
possible,
and
third,
there
are
many
projects
which
occur
of
which
we
don't
even
get
notice.
i
guess
since
the
court
wants
to
focus
on
the
timbering,
which
i
have
to
emphasize
again
is...
it's
the
collection
of
activities
that's
the
injury
here,
many
of
which
happen
instantaneously
when
the
plan's
adopted.
but
a
timbering
example.
in
this
plan,
there
is
provided
for
what
are
known
as
wildlife
openings.
it
sounds
wonderful,
but
really
what
it
is
about
is
doing
three--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--openings.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
openings,
and
under
the
plan
the
forest
service
is
going
to
go
in
and
cut
all
the
threes
in
3
to
5-acre
areas,
up
to
17
cuts
in
a
1,000-acre
area
through
the
designated
areas.
the
purpose
is
to
promote
deer
and
other
wildlife
associated
with
it.
now,
the
government
has
suggested
to
you
there's
some
big,
formal
decision
making
process,
and
appeals,
and
a
real
clear
opportunity
to
challenge
all
this.
that's
not
the
way
it
works.
a
forest
ranger
one
day
will
decide,
hey,
the
plan
calls
for
wildlife
openings.
under
their
own
regulations
and
rules,
that
is
categorically
excluded
from
any
further
formal
analysis
and
any
appeal
process,
so
the
forest
ranger
decides,
okay,
i'm
going
to
go
over
here,
i'm
going
to
cut
down
5
acres,
and
we're
going
to
have
a
wildlife
opening,
and
the
next
day
he'll
pick
another
area.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
well--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--well,
your
honor,
timber
cuts...
the
timbering
program
is
much
more
than
just
the
big
sales.
for
example,
a
lot
of
prep
work
goes
in
before
the
first
tree
is
cut,
even
for
a
big
sale.
they
have
to
build
trails,
some
of
which
may
be
a
short
couple
of
miles,
which
are
categorically
excluded
from
any
appeal
process
or
further
assessment.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
they
build
trails
both
for
timber
cuts,
in
which
case
they
would
not
build
them
before
they're
approved.
they
also
build
trails
to
do
what
is
known
as
timber
management,
which
is
to
do
things
to
the
timber
to
make
it
grow
faster.
they
also
for
the
purposes
of
wildlife
openings...
and
again,
if
we're
talking
about
openings
just
to
create
more
deer
habitat.
they
will
go
in...
these
rangers
are
making
these
kinds
of
decisions
under
a
plan
every
day,
and
a
good
percentage
of
those
decisions
are
not
subject
to
any
formal
decisionmaking
process,
and
i'm
not
even
mentioning
now
the
whole
issue
of
roads
and
orv
trails
and,
you
know,
the
other
things
the
court
is
uncomfortable
with,
although
i
assure
you
they
were
raised
in
the
administrative
record
and
have
been
a
subject
of
discussion
below.
the
real
issue
here
is,
how
much
of
this
forest
is
going
to
be
available
for
the
millions
of
ohioans
who
want
to
go
hiking
somewhere
and
not
run
into
a
motorcycle
and
not
watch
timber
being
cut
and
not
have
huge
openings,
and
not
have
too
many
deer
running
around
causing
accidents
on
the
road
on
the
way
in.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
if
i
understood
what
you're
referring
to.
in
terms
of
the
issues
being
raised--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--well,
you
can--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
the
forest
service's
own
regulations,
and
their
own
forest
service
handbook,
which
is
certainly
available
to
the
court,
talks
about
projects
being
categorically
excluded.
they
have
fire
break
limitations,
they
have
a
whole
list
of
certain
kinds
of
things
that
are
excluded
from
formal
decisionmaking
and
appeals.
so
it
is
true
that
on
the
large
timber
sales
we
get
a
notice,
but
even
there,
your
honor,
they
are
certainly
impending.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
timbering
in
this
forest
is
ridiculous.
it
is
so
small,
and
even
if
you
do
timber,
at
its
peak
of
timbering
in
the
wayne
it
was
providing
barely
over
1
percent
of
the
timber
that
comes
out
of
ohio.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
your
honor--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
i
didn't
use
zero,
but
our
contention
was
the
timbering
program
was
illegal,
and
the
reason
clearcutting
came
up
is
because,
since
the
forest
plan
chose
as
its
objective
trying
to
create
habitat
for
more
deer,
which
nobody
needed,
that
automatically
meant
clearcutting,
because
the
forest
service's
own
analysis
says,
if
you
want
to
clear
the
forest
the
cheapest
and
fastest
way
to
do
it
is
to
cut
everything.
therefore,
that's
why
the
plan
said
80
percent
of
all
cutting's
going
to
be
by
clearcutting.
but
it's
the
timber
program
that
was
the
complaint
here,
and
the
heart
of
the
complaint
wasn't
even
that.
it
was,
give
us
more
of
this
forest,
if
not
all
of
it,
so
the
people
of
ohio
can
have
one
place--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
i
would
focus
on,
in
terms
of
that
part
of
it,
the
nepa
claims,
and
if
you--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
it's
the
heart
of
the
whole
case.
the
reason
we
challenged
timbering
is
because--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--your
honor,
if
you
look
at
the
nepa
arguments
below,
in
the
appeal
court
and
the
trial
court,
you
will
find
discussion
about
not
enough
recreational
lands
being
protected.
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
it's
47,
your
honor.
i
got
the--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--there
isn't?
then
i
had
written
down
the
wrong--
mr.
frederick
m.
gittes
--thank
you.
