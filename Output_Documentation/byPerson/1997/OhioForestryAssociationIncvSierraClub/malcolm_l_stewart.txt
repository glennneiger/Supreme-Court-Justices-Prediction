mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
national
forest
management
act
requires
the
united
states
forest
service
to
devise
forest
plans
for
each
of
the
units
within
the
national
forest
system.
that
the
plans
are
to
be
revised
at
10
to
15-year
intervals,
and
they
perform
two
basic
functions.
first,
they
provide
general
guidance
to
forest
service
employees
in
the
management
of
the
affected
unit
and,
second,
they
serve
a
public
informational
function
by
giving
the
public
general
information
about
the
likely
management
activities
within
the
forest
and,
while
the
plans
vary
widely
from
place
to
place,
all
forest
plans
contain
projections
concerning
anticipated
timber
harvesting
activities
within
the
national
forest,
and
it's
that
feature
of
the
plan
that's
at
issue
here
today.
i'd
like
to
start
by
saying
that
in
our
view
it
would
be
misleading
to
frame
the
question
presented
in
this
case
as
whether
forest
plans
are
reviewable.
we're
not
asking
for
a
per
se
rule
in
this
case
and,
indeed,
we're
really
not
asking
for
a
special
rule
for
forest
plans.
what
we're
saying
is
that
the
court
should
examine
the
particular
plan
provision
that
is
at
issue
and
ask
whether
the
decision
or
determination
reflected
in
that
provision
is
reviewable
under
ordinary
principles
of
administrative
law
and,
in
our
view,
the
timber
harvesting
projections
at
issue
in
this
case
don't
meet
that
test.
the
harvesting--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--the
plans
are
unified
documents.
that
is,
the
plan
is
bound
together.
it
is
a
single
document,
but
it
contains
a
variety
of
provisions
and
some
provisions
may
reflect
decisions
having
immediate
on
the
ground
impact,
others
will
not,
and
the
question
should
be
whether
the
particular
plan
provision
at
issue
in
a
case
has
immediate
on
the
ground
impact,
and--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--one
of
the
cases
we
had
in
the
ninth
circuit
this
past
summer
and
fall
was
a
case
in
which
the
forest
service
amended
the
standards
and
guidelines
contained
in
a
plan
that
regulated
the
manner
in
which
timber
harvesting
activities
would
be
conducted
and
the
document
that
adopted
the
plan
amendment
said,
these
amended
standards
and
guidelines
will
not
apply
to
ongoing
timber
harvesting
activities.
and
we
were
sued
in
that
case
and
the
plaintiff's
contended
that
the
agency
had
behaved
unlawfully
in
failing
to
apply
the
new
standards
and
guidelines
to
ongoing
projects.
in
the
end
we
prevailed
on
the
merits
in
that
case,
but
we
conceded
that
that
was
a
justiciable
controversy,
because
the
decision
not
to
make
the
standards
and
guidelines
immediately
applicable
would
have
immediate
on
the
ground
impact.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
our
view
is
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--they
have.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
court
frankly
has
discretion
whether
to
consider
them
or
not.
they
are
part
of
the
record
below.
i
think
probably
the
more
normal
course
would
be
not
to
consider
them
because
they
were
filed
after
the
court
of
appeals
issued
its
decision
and
consequently
they
weren't
part
of
the
record
that
was
before
the
court
of
appeals.
we
don't
believe,
in
any
event,
that
the
affidavits
affect
the
justiciability
of
plaintiff's
facial
challenge
to
the
plan.
that
is,
the
affidavits
may
suggest
that
there
are
individual
timber
harvesting
activities
which
are
having,
or
did
have
before
they
were
enjoined,
immediate
on
the
ground
impact
and
those
specific
timber
harvesting
activities
would
have
been
subject
to
judicial
review.
that
wouldn't
mean
that
the
plan
level
projections
were
suitable
for
judicial
review.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
national
forest
management
act
doesn't
contain
its
own
judicial
review
provision,
so
that
the
suit
was
brought
under
the
apa.
now,
the
harvesting
projections
contained
in
the
wayne
plan
are
contingent
and
uncertain
in
several
important
respects.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
if,
for
instance,
the
timber
industry
contended
that
particular
areas
of
the
forest
had
been
improperly
designated
as
unsuitable
for
harvesting
i
think
you'd
really
have
a
different
sort
of
justiciability
problem.
that
is,
that
sort
of
decision
would
be
final
in
a
way
that
the
suitability
determination
here
is
not.
that
is,
if
land
is
designated
as
off
limits
for
harvesting
there's
not
some
subsequent
site
specific
decision
as
to
whether
timber
will
actually
be
harvested.
i
think,
though,
that
to
establish--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct,
and
here
it's--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
now,
i
think
the
industry
plaintiff
might
still
have
difficulty
establishing
the
redressibility
component
of
standing,
because
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
show
that
redesignation
of
the
land
as
suitable
for
timber
harvesting
was
ultimately
likely
to
lead
to
a
decision
actually
to
harvest
timber
and
to
the
award
of
a
contract
to
the
particular
company,
so
there
would
be
a
different
sort
of
justiciability
problem.
now--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about
here,
and
the
only
part
of
this
area
that
the
plan
regulates
is
the
federally
owned
land.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i'm
not
even
sure
if
you
would
call
that
the
national
forest.
it
is
land
within...
this
is
an
odd
sort
of
national
forest
in
that
it
consists
of
three
or
four
noncontiguous
segments
and
it's
interspersed
with
privately
owned
land,
but
the
management
plan
takes
into
account
uses
on
surrounding
property,
but
it
does
not
regulate
those
uses.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's...
that's
correct.
it's
around
176,000
federally
owned
acres.
now,
the
forest
plan
contains
projections
as
to
the
possible
aggregate
quantity
of
timber
that
might
be
harvested
on
the
forest
during
the
plan
period,
but
those
harvesting
projections
are
not
binding.
it's
not
uncommon
for
the
forest
service
to
harvest
substantially
less
timber
than
it
is
allowed
to
harvest
on
a
particular
unit.
and
i
think,
second,
even
leaving
aside
the
determination
as
to
aggregate
quantity
of
timber,
the
forest
plan
leaves
the
service
with
very
substantial
latitude
as
to
where
within
the
forest
harvesting
will
occur.
for
example,
this
forest
plan
designated
approximately
126,000
acres
within
the
forest
as
suitable
for
timber
harvesting,
but
it
projected
that
less
than
8,000
acres
within
the
forest
would
actually
be
harvested
during
the
first
10
years
of
the
plan
and
until
we
know
where
within
the
forest
the
service
intends
to
harvest
timber,
various
things
remain
uncertain.
first,
we
don't
know
whether
particular
people
will
be
hurt,
whether
their
activities
within
the
forest
will
be
impaired
by
the
harvesting
that
does
occur.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
if
they
literally
claimed
that
they
use
the
entire
forest,
they...
at
least
at
the
motion
to
dismiss
stage,
that
would
take
care
of
it.
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
they
would
be
required
to
furnish
evidence
to
that
effect.
second,
even
aside
from
the
uncertainty
as
to
what
people
will
be
injured,
we
really
don't
know
whether
logging
will
be
rational
until
we
know
on
what
site
it
is
designated
to
occur.
that
is,
it's
integral
to
the
forest
service's
implementation
of
the
national
forest
management
act
that
the
propriety
of
timber
harvesting
can
vary
widely
from
site
to
site
even
within
a
particular
national
forest.
that's
why--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
think
that
it
would
vary
because
the
80,000,
whatever
figure
the
forest
service
projected
would
still
only
be
a
projection.
we
still
wouldn't
know
whether
the
forest
service
would
actually
harvest
timber
up
to
that
amount
and
until
it
conducted
the
site
specific
analysis
of
particular
tracts
we
wouldn't
know
whether
it
made
sense
to
harvest
timber
there,
so
i
think
in
a
sense
this
is
a
paradigmatic
example
of
a
case
in
which
deferral
of
litigation
until
a
latter
stage
in
the
process
would
conserve
the
resources
of
the
court
and
prevent
unnecessary
litigation.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
there
are
about
three
different
responses.
the
first
is
that
if
it
is,
in
fact,
true
that
there
is
a
particular
plan
level
determination
that
is
dispositive
with
respect
to
a
number
of
timber
sales
then,
if
the
plaintiff
files
suit
to
challenge
an
initial
sale
and
persuades
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals,
if
the
case
is
taken
up
on
appeal
that
the
plan
level
determination
is
irrational,
that
determination
will
be
preclusive
in
subsequent
litigation
between
the
same
parties,
so
a
single
party
is
not
going
to
have
to
relitigate
the
same
issue
over
and
over.
the
second
thing
we
would
point
out
is
that
both
the
eighth
and
eleventh--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
i
think
one
example
of
a
situation
in
which
a
plan
level
determination
might
be
dispositive
is
if
the
plaintiffs
came
in
and
said,
here
is
a
large
area
within
the
forest
and
the
forest
service
should
have
left
that
area
entirely
off
limits
to
logging,
and
it
was
irrational
for
the
forest
service
to
permit
any
logging
within
that
area,
and
if
they
persuaded
the
court
that
it
was
indeed
irrational
to
permit
logging
anywhere
within
that
area,
that
determination
would
be
preclusive.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think...
i
think...
well,
i
think
it
is
certainly
true
that
it's
hard
to
imagine
a
site
specific
activity
that
would
present
a
suitable
vehicle
for
the
court
to
review
the
whole
plan,
and
i
think
if--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no,
we
don't.
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
federal
courts
had
unlimited
time
and
resources
and
if
it
were
the
case
that
the
role
of
the
federal
courts
was
to
monitor
the
agency's
protection
of
the
public
interest,
then
it
would
be
a
strong
objection
to
our
theory
that
there
will
be
no
site
specific
action
that
brings
the
whole
plan
before
the
courts.
but,
in
fact,
as
this
court
noted
in
defenders
of
wildlife,
the
role
of
the
federal
courts
is
to
protect
the
rights
of
individual
litigants
and
forest
service
employees
whose
specialty
it
is
to
manage
the
forests
spend
years
devising
these
plans,
and
to
expect--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
mean,
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
in
a
sense
this
is
a
familiar
sort
of
problem
in
administrative
law.
that
is,
it's
often
the
case
that
a
particular
agency
action
will
be
brought
before
a
court
that
implicates
a
narrow,
specific
regulatory
provision,
and
a
court
will
be
told
by
the
parties,
in
order
to
understand
why
this
action
does
or
doesn't
make
sense,
you
have
to
have
an
appreciation
of
the
larger
legal
context,
and
the
parties
will
provide
the
court
at
least
with
general
information
about
what
that
context
is.
but
to
say
that
you
can
review
a
specific
action
within
a
larger
context
is
different
from
saying
that
you
review
the
context
as
such.
the
plaintiffs
are
always
free
to
challenge
individual
site
specific
actions.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
and
our
point
is
that
they
have
not
been
harmed
in
any
way
by
the
clearcutting
projections
contained
in
the
plan
unless
and
until
clearcutting
actually
occurs.
i
mean,
one
of
the
noteworthy
things
about--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
and
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--no,
and
i
think
this
falls
squarely
within
this
court's
decision
in
national
wildlife
federation
in
which
the
court
said,
absent
an
instruction
from
congress,
that
review
should
proceed
at
a
higher
level
of
generality.
ordinarily,
we...
the
court
entertains
challenges
to
regulations
only
when
the
regulation
is
applied
to
a
particular
set
of
facts.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
mean,
that's
correct
in
a
challenge
to
a
site
specific--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--clearcutting
determination.
that
would
be
a
dispositive
objection
if
that's
what
the
statute
said.
