mr.
steven
r.
quarles
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
like
to
turn
to
the
merits
and
discuss
three
of
the
sixth
circuit's
decisions.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
we
intervened
here
because
we
believed
that
the
respondents,
or,
rather,
the
plaintiffs
had
raised
issues
which
we
felt
were
inappropriate
both
as
to
justiciability
and
as
to
the
merits.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
our
clients
are
clearly
injured
by
the
decision
in
the
sixth
circuit.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
the
decision
gives
it
concrete
effect.
the
decision
said
that
because
the
forest
service
was
biased
the
plan
was
unlawful
and,
in
fact,
when
the
sixth
circuit
decision
was
remanded
to
the
district
court,
the
district
court
read
the
sixth
circuit
decision
as
saying
that
the
forest
service
could
not,
in
fact,
prepare
a
lawful
plan,
that
the
entire
plan
was
unlawful,
and
enjoined
timber
sales,
so
we
are
clearly
injured.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
our
belief
is
that
neither
we
nor
the
sierra
club
typically
have
standing
to
challenge
a
general
plan,
and
that
only
in
very
unusual
circumstances
will
a
plan
be
site
specific
enough
to
provide
both
ripeness
and
article
iii
standing,
including
redressibility.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
that
is
correct,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
district
court
found
on
remand,
that
there
could
not
be
a
timber
sale.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
that's
correct.
the
three
merits
issues
that
i
would
like
to
talk
about--
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
--we
will
always
prefer
to
have
a
plan,
because
a
plan
without
a
plan,
nothing
can
occur.
with
a
plan,
something
can
occur,
but
our
view
is
that
typically
we
will
not
be
able
to
challenge
a
plan
either
until
such
time
as
there
is
a
site
specific
decision.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
i
would
acknowledge
that
it's
clearly
ripe.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
there
may
be
a
question
as
to
standing
simply
because
of
the
redressibility.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
because
they
could
wait
till
the
first
clearcut
sale
in
order
to
challenge,
but
yes,
i
would
believe
either
of
two
things.
if
a
plan
said
there
shall
be
no
cutting
at
all,
then
we
would
come
very
close
to
being
in
a
position
to
challenge
the
plan
and
also
if
the
plan
said
that
the
entire
forest
will
be
cut.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
excuse
me?
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
well,
i
think
we
could...
if
they
said
no
clearcutting
at
all
i
think
it
would
certainly
be
ripe
for
us,
but
there
is
still
a
redressibility
question,
and
that
was
found
against
us
by
the
eleventh
circuit
in
region
8
forest
timber
purchaser's
council,
so
i
cannot
be
confident
that--
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
--excuse
me?
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
if
it
said
no
clearcutting
it
would
still
allow
some
other
forms
of
cutting,
and
if
the
plan
was
remanded
and
the
forest
service
proceeded
to
redo
the
plan,
the
forest
service
still
has
the
discretion
to
offer
very
little
or
very
much
timber,
and
there
is
a
redressibility
question.
i
like
to
believe
we
could
get
to
court,
but
all
i'm
saying
is
at
least
one
circuit
has
found
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
that
is
our
position.
in
fact,
in
their
complaint
they
complained
that
the
plan
did
not
provide
a
site
specific
decision
as
to
optimality
and,
indeed,
that's
impossible
until
a
site
specific
decision
is
raised
and
it
is
clear--
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
--optimality.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
the
national
forest
management
act
requires
that
for
even
aged
management,
clearcutting
in
particular,
that
the
forest
service
at
the
time
of
the
sale
has
to
find
that
clearcutting
is
the
optimum
method,
or
that
other
even
aged
management
is
the
appropriate
method
for
timber
harvesting
on
that
site.
and
that's
why
clearly,
in
most
instances,
even
if
it
said
clearcutting
will
be
allowed,
it's
important
to
see
the
site
specific
analysis
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
is
appropriate
for
that
site,
and
that's
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
at
the
time
of
the
sale?
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
absolutely
not.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
certainly
they
could,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
issue
to
raise,
because
what
both...
what
respondents
and
their
amici
said
in
their
briefs
is,
they
thought
that
the
plan
should
be
challenged
before
it
can
be
implemented,
and
i
remind
you
that
these
are
10
to
15-year
plans
and
we
are
10
years
from
the
date
on
which...
10-1/2
years
from
the
date
on
which
the
plan
was
first
proposed.
40
sales
have
proceeded.
under
respondent's
theory,
the
forest
service
would
have
been
paralyzed
to
do
anything
for
these
last
10
years
until
the
validity
of
the
plan
had
been
established,
and
we
believe
that's
inappropriate.
the
three
bias
issues
that
i
would
like
to
talk
about
are
first
the...
or
the
three
merits
issues,
are
first
the
issue
of
bias
in
favor
of
the
timber
harvesting
by
virtue,
it
seems,
of
the
very
statutes
that
require
the
forest
service
to
provide
for
that
activity.
the
second
is
the
sixth
circuit's
overturning
of
the
forest
service
multiple
use
allocations
on
the
basis
that
the
plan
overvalued
timber,
undervalued
wilderness
recreation,
when
the
agency's
broad
discretion
and
technical
expertise
should
have
elicited
judicial
deference.
and
third,
that
they
concluded
even
age
management
is
restricted
to
exceptional
circumstance
when
that
very
proposition
had
been
addressed
and
rejected
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
an
exhaustive
opinion
which
the
sixth
circuit
did
not
even
cite
or
address.
i
think
at
the
outset
it's
worth
noting...
observing
that
the
bias
and
merits
rulings
and
the
standing
rulings,
the
justiciability
rulings,
are
cut
from
the
same
cloth.
each
set
of
rulings
in
its
own
way
demonstrates
the
sixth
circuit's
failure
to
acknowledge
the
limited
authority
of
the
federal
courts
to
inject
themselves
into
areas
of
policy
that
have
been
entrusted
to
the
political
branches,
and
this
is
particularly
true
in
the
case
of
the
bias
proposal
of
the
sixth
circuit.
respondents
did
not
attempt
to
defend
that,
but
they
did
say
that
it's
dicta,
and
that
this
court
should
ignore
it.
that
seems
to
be
very
wrong
to
me
as
an
idea.
we
don't
believe
it's
dicta,
but
even
if
it
is,
the
suggestion
that
this
court
should
ignore
it
seems
to
be
in
error.
first
of
all,
the
sixth
circuit
clearly
gave
that
dicta
for
effect,
and
that
effect
that
they
wanted
was
to
have
the
agency
note
it
and
alter
their
behavior
accordingly
and
to
have
the
district
courts
in
the
circuit
note
it,
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
on
remand.
the
district
court,
in
a
transcript
we
lodged
with
this
court,
reviewed
the
bias
ruling
and
found
that
it
made
the
entire
plan
unlawful,
and
that
the
forest
service
would
be
incapable
of
preparing
a
lawful
plan
under
that--
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
--the
bias
ruling
in
my
view
is
wrong
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
was
made
without
any
reference
to
the
administrative
record.
there
is
nothing
in
the
administrative
record
to
demonstrate
that
bias
and
the
court,
in
fact,
used
the
bias
ruling
to
avoid
providing
any
deference
to
the
agency,
even
though
this
is
the
kind
of
case
that
requires
deference...
broad
discretion,
technical
expertise...
and,
as
this
court
said
in
chevron,
circumstances
where
congress
entrusted
to
the
agency
to
solve
competing
interests.
this
is
exactly
such
a
case,
because
congress
entrusted
to
the
agency
to
solve
competing
demands
by
multiple
users
of
the
forest,
so
in
that
sense
i
think
it's
very
wrong.
it's
also
wrong
in
the
sense
that
typically
there
is
supposed
to
be
a
presumption
of
agency
regularity
and
good
faith,
and
the
only
time
that
i'm
aware
when
they
found
bias
has
been
in
extrajudicial
circumstances,
and
that's
not
the
case
here.
they
just
simply
said
it
was
bias.
and
the
third
reason
that
is
so
extraordinary--
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
--circumstances
in
which
it
was
outside
of
the
legal
framework,
where
somebody
had
gone
on
television,
a
judge
had
gone
on
television
and
made
a
comment,
or
something
like
that.
but
the
third
reason
i
think
is
the
most
extraordinary,
and
that
is,
the
court
found
that
bias
in
the
statutory
mission
of
the
agencies.
it
found
it
in
three
statutes,
the
first
the
1897
organic
act,
which
requires
the
forest
service
to
establish
forests
for
purposes
of
continue...
furnishing
a
continuous
timber
supply
to
meet
the
needs
of
the
american
people.
a
second
statute
that
returned
25
percent
of
the
revenues
to
local
communities
for
use
for
roads
and
forests,
and
a
third
statute
that
returned
a
part
of
the
revenue
to
the
forest
service
for
purposes
of
reforestation.
without
acknowledging
that
those
were
statutory
provisions,
the
court
pointed
to
those
three
reasons
as
to
why
there
was
bias
in
the
forest
service,
and
i
would
maintain
the
notion
that
an
agency's
following
the
law
is
a
bias,
which
allows
the
court
not
to
provide
deference
to
the
agency,
is
an
extraordinary
notion
that
goes
well
beyond
the
bounds
of
judicial
behavior.
more
importantly,
under
that
bias
theory--
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
--that's
correct.
if
there...
if
we
find
there
is
no
justiciability,
then
this
court
need
not
comment
on
it.
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
well,
that's
an
interesting
question.
of
course,
it
would
say
vacated
on
other
grounds,
and
this
was
en
banc
reviewed,
and
so
there's
always
a
question
whether
they
would
believe
it.
i
think
that
this
dicta
is
so
extraordinary
that
the
notion
that,
because
it's
dicta
this
court
can't
address
it,
is
a
notion
that--
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
--yes.
[laughter]
exactly.
the
notion
that
this...
the
notion
that
the
farther
a
circuit
court
goes
in
dicta
beyond
its
proper
judicial
function
the
more
this
court
has
to
stay
silent
seems
to
me
to
be
highly
inappropriate,
and
i
believe
this
court
has
the
supervisory
power
to
inform
lower
courts
when
they
clearly
have
violated
the
separation
of
powers
limitations,
so
for
that
reason,
yes,
i
think
it
is
perfectly
permissible,
but
certainly
a
cautious
court
would
say
that
once
justiciability
isn't
there,
that
there's
no
need
to
go
on
to
any
of
the
merits,
including
the
dicta.
the--
mr.
steven
r.
quarles
--that,
too,
your
honor.
the
uneven
age
management
issue,
i...
well,
first
of
all
let
me
say
that
the
notion
about
multiple
use
allocation,
the
bias
toward
timber,
that
was
proven
wrong.
if
the
court
had
provided
deference
and
looked
at
the
administrative
record,
the
fact
is
that
primitive
recreation
received
26,000
acres,
whereas
timber
harvesting
will
only
occur
on
7,000.
that's
15
percent
of
the
forest
that
went
to
primitive
recreation,
5
percent
that
would
have
gone
to
timber
harvesting.
they
make
much
of
the
fact
that
126,000
acres
were
found
suitable
for
timber
harvesting,
but
the
plan
is
clear
that
in
the
life
of
the
plan
only
7,800-and-some-odd
acres
would
actually
be
harvested.
i
think
that's
very
important.
the
second
thing
is,
is
that...
thank
you.
