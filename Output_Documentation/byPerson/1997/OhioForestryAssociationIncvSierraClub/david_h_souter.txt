justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
take
it
you'd
agree
here
that
if
their
claim
were
that
your
plan
was
allowing
motorcycles
into
a
bird
watching
area
or
something
that
like,
that
would
be
immediately
justiciable
on
your
theory,
would
it
not?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stewart,
your...
the
sierra
club
at
least
has
raised
one
answer
to
that
argument
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
it.
they
say
that
if,
in
fact,
they
have
to
wait
for
site
specific
decisions
they
will,
in
order
to
maintain
their
objection
to
the
plan,
have
to
challenge
every
single
one
of
them,
because
part
of
their
argument
is
that
there
is
just
a
legally
erroneous
imbalance
here
between
the
timbering
decision...
the
timbering
allocation
and
the
nontimbering
allocation,
and
so
they
say
i
think
at
one
point
in
their
brief
that
if
they
do
what
you
claim
they
should
do
they're
going
to
have
to
file
something
like
40
lawsuits
and
that
would
not
conserve
judicial
resources.
they're
addressing,
in
other
words,
the
hardship
prong
both
to
themselves
and,
i
suppose,
to
the
courts
under
abbott
lab.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
of
course,
on
the
other
side,
the...
as
i
understand
it
plans
do
not
mandate
cutting,
plans
authorize
cutting,
so
that
if
a
plan
said
there
may
be
clearcutting
on
every
acre
of
this
property,
as
far
as...
i
suppose
your
position
would
be
that
the
sierra
club
still
would
not
have
a
ripe
claim
because
they
would
still
have
to
wait
to
see
on
a
site
specific
basis
whether
clearcutting
would
be
allowed
on
this
acre.
wouldn't
that
be
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
you'd
like
some
dicta
from
us,
too,
wouldn't
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
did
not
at
the
same
time
say,
with
respect
to
timbering,
we
will
open
it
at
this
moment
to
timbering
now,
and
isn't
that
the
nub
of
your
disagreement
with
the
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
because
the...
it
seems
to
me
on
the
analogy
with
justice
scalia's
hypothesis
the
injury
in
your
case
occurs
when
the
hiker
goes
to
the
tract
to
hike
and
can't
hike
in
it,
or
finds
that
the
timber
company's
saws
are
waiting
to
cut,
so
the
injury
is
imminent.
isn't
that
the
analogy?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
the...
you
know,
if
the
road
building
equipment
is
there
and
they're
about
to
lay
the
asphalt,
no
question,
i
assume,
on
the
government's
part
you've
got
your
standing.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
can't
you...
i
don't
mean
to
cut
off
your
argument,
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--can't
you
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
any
prospective
governmental
determination
that
has
not
yet
been
implemented?
you
can
always
say,
they
wouldn't
be
saying
this,
or
writing
this,
or
promulgating
this
unless
they
intended,
in
fact,
to
do
what
they
say,
and
so
if
your
argument
is
sufficient,
it
seems
to
me
it
really
cuts
the
ripeness
doctrine
out
of
the
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
that
may
be,
but
isn't
the
question
before
you
whether
your
objection
to
these
objectives
cannot
be
raised
and
fairly
litigated
until
the
moment
at
which
they
start
to
implement
it?
isn't
that
the
problem
before
us?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
administrator
doesn't,
but
it
doesn't
follow
from
that
that
you
cannot
at
that
point
raise
the
bigger
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay,
but
your
argument
is
that
if
you
challenge
the
point
at
which
the
one
tree
is
going
to
be
cut,
you're
going
to
have
to
bring
all
of
these
other
things
in.
you
want
to
bring
all
of
those
other
things
in
now.
the
question
is,
when
do
you
bring
them
in,
and
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
an
objection
to
the
ripeness
suggestion
that
justice
breyer
made
to
say,
well,
we'll
have
to
litigate
a
lot
when
we
do.
that's
accept...
that's
a
wash.
that's
going
to
be
true
whenever
you
litigate--
justice
david
h.
souter
--on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
i
think
you're
making
a
pretty
good
argument
for
the
fact
that
you
can
go
in
before
the
moment
of
the
cutting,
and
maybe
you
can
go
in
now,
because
you're
saying,
i
won't
get
notice
and,
in
fact,
the
hardship
of
waiting
until
they
start
cutting
will
in
practice
mean
we'll
never
get
to
challenge
them,
but
that's
a
very
different
thing,
i
think,
from
the
challenge
to
clearcutting
as
such.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
that...
i
can
see
the...
your
argument
there,
whether
it
wins
or
not,
is
much
stronger
than
your
argument
with
respect
to
clearcutting
tracts
which
will
require
further
administrative
action,
which
you
will
have
notice
of.
