well
then,
in
most
cases
the
plans
aren't
unified
documents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
said
that
about
80,000
would
be
targeted
for
timber...
out
of
the
126,000
acres
total,
and
they
said,
oh,
about
80,000
are
eligible
for
timber
cutting.
would
the
standing
calculus,
the
ripeness
calculus
here
vary?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
before
you
do
that,
why
was
it
that
you
intervened
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
are
your
clients
injured
by
this
plan?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
plan
does
have
some
concrete
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
redress
you
seek
is
the
reinstatement
of
the
plan
and
i
assume
that's
because
it
gives
you
some
specific
advantage.
i
can't
see
how
you
can
have
it
both
ways,
and
to
say
that
the
sierra
club
has
no
standing
if
they
set
aside
the
plan
but
that
you
have
injury
if
the
plan
is
set
aside,
it
seems
to
me
is
just
inconsistent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'll
think
about
it,
because
i
want
to
hear
about
the
merits,
but
it
still
seems
to
me
that
why
you're...
the
reason
you're
here
is
so
that
there
can
be
logging,
and
that's
the
same
reason
the
sierra
club's
here.
i
don't
understand.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
wanted
substantiation
for
the
argument
that
you're
now
making,
is
it
contained
in
any
other
decisions
of
any
other
courts,
or
in
the
record
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
want
us
to
write
an
opinion
in
this
part
of
your
argument
saying
that
these
decisions
are
being
made
all
the
time,
the
forest
is
being
affected
even
as
we
sit
here,
et
cetera.
how
do
i
know
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--other
than
your
submission?
