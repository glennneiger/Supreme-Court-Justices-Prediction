justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
why
is
it...
why
can't
you
just
say,
they
wouldn't
have
cut
these
trees
if
they'd
had
a
legally
correct
plan?
this
plan
is
not
legally
correct.
we
don't
know
what
they
would
have
done
with
a
legally
correct
plan,
but
they
wouldn't
be
cutting
these
trees.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
wouldn't
they
be
able
to
challenge
it
just
as
an
agency
which
takes
action
pursuant
to
a
rule?
you
would
say,
the
rule
isn't
valid,
therefore...
we
don't
know
if
they
would
have
done
it
with
some
other
rule
or
not,
but
they
can't
do
it
from
this
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
the
regulation
is
unlawful,
you
can't
do
the
clearcutting,
right?
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
plan
that's
unlawful
and
you
clearcut
in
a
particular
place,
how
could
you
do
it
if
the
regulation,
i.e.
the
plan,
was
unlawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
quick
question
about...
i'm
a
little
nervous
about
the
government's
answer
to
my
last
question,
which
was
qualified
at
the
end
that
it
was
ripe
if
that's
what
the
statute
provided.
so
imagine
that
5
years
from
now,
having
won
this
case...
you
won
it...
then
the
sierra
club,
at
the
point
when
they've
actually
going
to
clearcut,
the
saws
are
there,
i
mean,
every
legal
thing
is
done,
the
trees
are
about
to
come
down,
at
that
point
they
come
into
court
and
they
say,
look,
the
trees
are
being
cut
down.
we
certainly
have
standing
to
complain,
and
one
of
our
legal
arguments
is
that
the
plan
that
led
to
this
particular
sale
is
legally
invalid.
do
you
know
any
reason
why
they
would
be
unable
to
make
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
said
below...
i
mean,
in
your
brief
you
said,
well,
we
have
standing
because
we
have
some
people
who
watch
birds
and
this
plan
allows
the
motorcycle
to
come
through
and
that
disturbs
the
birds.
all
right,
that
might
give
you
standing,
as
was
just
conceded.
but
i
didn't
notice
in
your
complaint
or
in
the
arguments
below
where
this
was
made
a
point.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
maybe
you'd
have
a
different
case.
i
thought
this
case
was
about
clearcutting.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what
it
seems
to
have
been
argued
on,
so
if
now
it's
a
question
of
motorcycles
disturbing
the
hikers,
that
sounds
like
a
different
case,
which
the
government
said
you
might
have
standing
on
that
one,
so
where
is,
now,
that
all
been
argued.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
question
is,
where
has
this
been
argued
below,
or
that
what
you're
actually
bringing
this
case
for
is
to
protect
the
interests
of
hikers
and
bird
watchers
from
being
disturbed
by
motorcycles.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
cite
something
in
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
you've
mentioned
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean
in
the
courts.
i
mean,
this
has
been
a
case
in
the
courts.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
saying
you
don't
have
standing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
don't
see
in
paragraph
20
anything
that
says
the
roads
will
interfere
with
hikers
or
motorcyclists,
and
i
don't
see
anything
in
paragraph
25
that
says
anything
like
that,
either.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
take
that
to
assume,
reading
this
and
reading
the
arguments
below,
that
you're
talking
about
clearcutting.
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
i
guess
i'm
pushing
this
a
little
bit
because
i
want
to
satisfy
myself
that
there
really
isn't
this
bird
watcher
hiker
motorcycle
argument
in
the
case,
because
i
do
believe
it
would
make
quite
a
different
case
out
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
25
doesn't
deal
with...
i
don't
think
it
deals
with
nepa
violations.
you
may
have
the
wrong
number--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the...
if
you'd
focus,
it
would
help
me.
if
you'd
first
assume
with
me
that
you
didn't
clearly
argue...
i
know
you
don't
want
to
make
this
assumption,
but
let's
assume
that
you
clearly...
or
did
not
argue
clearly
that
you're
trying
to
protect
the
hikers,
the
bird
watchers,
et
cetera,
from
the
motorcycles.
assume
that
all
that
is
at
stake
is
a
claim
that
you
made
that
we
are
harmed
by
clearcutting.
all
right.
focusing
solely
on
that
now,
i'm
curious
as
to
why
it's
ripe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they've
said,
the
government,
is
it
will
be
ripe
at
the
point
when
somebody
has
a
definite
plan
to
cut
the
tree,
i.e.,
the
permissions
have
been
granted,
this
tree
will
be
cut.
at
that
point
you
would
come
in
and
say,
this
tree
is
going
to
be
cut.
we
think
that's
unlawful
because
it
flows
from
an
unlawful
plan,
making
just
the
arguments
you
make
now.
now,
why
can't
you
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why...
you
can
say,
look,
you
see
this
tree,
it's
coming
down.
you
know
why
it's
coming
down?
because
they
had
a
faulty
plan.
if
they
had
not
put
aside
40
acres,
or
4,000,
or
whatever
they'd
done,
they'd
put
aside
some
different
amount,
and
we
have
no
way
of
knowing
it
would
have
been
this
tree.
nobody
could
say
it
would
have
been
this
tree,
and
therefore
you
have
to
look
at
the
faulty
plan.
what--
