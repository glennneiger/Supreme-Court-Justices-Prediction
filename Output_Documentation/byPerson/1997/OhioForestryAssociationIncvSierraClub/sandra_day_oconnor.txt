mr.
stewart,
the
respondents
have
filed
some
supplemental
affidavits,
have
they
not?
justice

o'connor
is
there
anything...
should
we
consider
those
and,
if
so,
is
there
anything
in
those
that
would
reflect
an
immediate
actionable
matter?
justice

well,
mr.
stewart,
what
they
basically,
as
i
understand
it,
want
to
attack
is
a
policy
of
allowing
clearcutting,
or
even
aged
forest
management,
whatever
euphemistic
term
you
want
to
call
it,
but
clearcutting,
and
they
say
that
the
overall
plan
envisions
clearcutting
and
that's
wrong,
and
they
want
to
challenge
that
concept.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
if
there's
standing
there's
a
ripeness
issue
as
well,
is
there
not?
