mr.
terry
l.
weldon
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
standard
under
which
a
school
district
can
be
held
liable
for
violation
of
title
ix
of
the
education
amendments
when
one
of
its
teachers
intentionally
discriminates
against
one
of
his
students
by
engaging
in
sexual
harassment
of
her.
petitioner
was
clearly
subjected
to
intentional
discrimination
under,
using
the
terminology
of
this
statute,
under
the
educational
programs
and
activities
provided
by
the
respondent.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
we're
using
in
the
briefs
and
in
the
documents
in
the
case
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
we're
using
the
term,
sexual
harassment,
as
synonymous
with
discrimination,
and
i
believe
the
franklin
court--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--well--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--and
i
think
that's
amply
shown
by
the
record
in
this
case
and
i
think
that
the
franklin
case
simply
stands
for
the
proposition
that
when
a
teacher
intentionally
harasses
a
student,
that
is
discrimination
based
on
sex.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
yes,
sir.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
if
the
harassment
was
based
on
sex,
yes.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
and
in
this
case
that's
exactly
what
happened.
the
teacher
singled
out
this
young
girl.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
because
of
her
sex.
the
fifth
circuit
standard
from
which
we
appeal
would
require
proof
of
actual
knowledge
not
only
in
the
school
district
generally
but
in
the
superior
of
the
teacher
who
was
guilty
of
the
discrimination,
or
at
least
in
some
person
who
had
immediate
power
over
that
teacher
with
respect
to--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
i'll
do
it
right
now.
the...
there
are
obvious
similarities
between
title
vii
and
title
ix
in
that
they
have
as
their
object
the
prevention
or
redress
of
sexual
discrimination,
but
there
are
important
differences
as
well.
as
we
are
argue
in
some
detail
in
the
brief,
those
differences
lead,
i
think,
to
the
conclusion
that
title
ix
provides
wider
protection
even
though
it
does
not
use
the
word
agent
in
a
definitional
way
as
title
vii
does
with
respect
to
employers.
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
focus
of
the
two
statutes
is
quite
different.
the
focus
in
title
vii
says...
is
on
the
employer,
and
it
tells
what
the
employer
and
his
agents
are
prohibited
from
doing.
as
the
court
pointed
out
early
on
in
the
cannon
case,
the
focus
of
title
ix
is
completely
different.
the
focus
there
is
on
the
beneficiary,
and
the
focus
is
on
discrimination
without
respect
to
who
might
be
guilty
of
the
discrimination.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
the
respondent,
with
all
respect,
i
think
overreads
the
spending
clause
and
overreads
the
cases
that
construe
the
spending
clause.
my
belief
is,
and
i'm
referring
specifically
to
pennhurst,
my
belief
is
that
the
spending
clause
statute
must
fairly
inform
the
recipient
of
the
funds
what
the
conditions
of
the
funding
are.
at
the
time
in
question
in
this
case
the
school
district
obviously
knew
the
contents
of
title
ix.
the
school
district
obviously
knew
the
contents
of
regulations
which
have
the
force
of
statute
because
the
statute
authorizes
the
department
of
education
and
predecessor
agencies
to
enact
these
regulations.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
that
would
be
my--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--my
disagreement
with
the
implication
of
your
question,
justice
souter,
and
that
is
that
i
do
not
believe
that
the
pennhurst
case
or
any
of
the
spending
clause
cases
require
any
extensive
catalogue
of
what
facts
or
what
fact
patterns
might
trigger
liability,
any
more
than
the
spending
clause
requires
an
exhaustive
listing
of
the
potential
remedies
that
might
follow
if
there
is
a
violation.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
yes.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
i
think...
to
the
extent
that
there
are
differences,
i
think
they
get
resolved
the
same
way.
i
think
that
the
spending
clause
simply...
and
i
don't
mean
to
oversimplify,
but
simply
requires
that
the
recipient
of
federal
funds
have
some
idea,
some
clear
idea
what
the
conditions
of
accepting
the
fund
are,
and
here
i
find
no
ambiguity
in
anything
that
the
school
district--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--yes,
sir.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
if
i
may,
justice
scalia,
i'll
invoke
your
concurring
opinion
in
the
franklin
case
and
simply
observe
that
a
couple
of
bridges
have
been
crossed.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
well,
i--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--i
understand
that,
but
i'd
like
to
point
out,
as
you
pointed
out
in
that
same
concurring
opinion,
that
congress
then
took
subsequent
action--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--with
the
enactment
of
the
civil
rights
bill
that
extended
title
ix
to
the
states.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
and
i
believe
that
it
has
to
be
taken
in
the
context
of
the
cannon
case.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
and
then,
of
course,
the
second
step
was
to
recognize
in
franklin
that
despite
the
silence
of
the
statute,
which
obviously,
being
implied,
would
be
silent,
that
the
presumption
is
that
all
reasonable
remedies
or
usual
remedies
apply.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
your
honor,
i
haven't
read
the
statute
closely,
but
i
think
the
statute
is
specific
with
respect
to
title
vii.
i
think
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
for
congress
to
consider
whether
enacting
a
statute
imposing
caps
on
title
ix
precisely
the
way
they
have
done
for
title
vii,
but
i
do
think--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--it's
obviously
a
policy
consideration,
but
with
all
deference
i
think
it's
probably...
my
view
is
that
it's
a
legislative
policy
consideration
and
not
a
judicial
one.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
and
again,
your
question
is
specifically
with
regard
to
caps--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--i
think
the
title
vii
cases
are
an
appropriate
analogue.
i
think
the
court
reflected
at
least
that
instinct,
i
wouldn't
call
it
a
holding,
by
it's
reference
to
the
meritor
in
the
midst
of
the
franklin
case,
but
i
think
title
vii
is
just
an
analogue
and
not
a
direct
road
map,
and
i
think
the
reason
for
that
is
principally
because,
first
of
all...
two
things.
the
context
of
title
ix
is
significantly
different
than
the
context
of
title
vii.
title
ix
obviously
applies
to
education
from
kindergarten
or
preschool
all
the
way
up
to
post
graduate,
and
the
other
reason
is
the
text
of
the
statutes
are
so
completely
different.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
if
you're--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--yes.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
that's
right.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
i
do
not
think
so.
frankly,
that's
not
a
question
that's
concerned
me.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
it
occurred
to
me
in
my
preparation,
but
i
do
not
think
so.
i
don't
think
so
because
i
think
what
would
govern
the
case...
the
court
in
these
decisions
is
the
text
of
title
ix
and
the
text
of
the
actual
regulations,
the
code
of
federal
regulations
that
were
adopted
implementing
title
ix
as
the
department
was
authorized
to
do.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
i
just
want
to
point
out...
yes,
but
i
want
to
point
out
that
at
least
in
my
mind
there's
a
considerable
distinction
between
the
regulations
in
the
code
of
federal
regulations,
which
are
fairly
minimal,
as
compared
to
the
guidelines
which
are
merely
intended,
i
believe,
and
do
not
have
the
same
statutory
force
as
the
regulations
do.
the
guidelines
are
a
means
of
educating
school
districts
and
helping
them
implement
title
ix,
but
they
do
not
have
the
force
of
law
with...
in
the
same
way
as
these
regulations.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
the
government
is
going
to
argue
that
extensively,
and
i
don't
want
to
anticipate
the
government's
argument
too
much,
and
i
certainly
wouldn't
want
to
disagree
with
them,
but
my
own
personal
answer
to
that
would
be
not
necessarily.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
yes,
sir.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
and
the
principal
reason
in
this
case
that
they
did
not
have
any
knowledge
is
that
they
failed
to
follow
the
regulations,
which
have
the
force
of
law,
and
the
regulations
required
not
only
the
adoption
of
an
antidiscrimination
policy,
which
they
have
summary
judgment
establishing
that
they
did,
but
a
complaint
procedure
and
publicizing
that
complaint
procedure
to
the
student
body,
and
that
is
our
principal
and
primary
argument,
that
by
failing
to
follow
that
regulation
they
created
for
themselves
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
now
recognized
as
an
absolute
defense.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
that's
true,
but
the
testimony
in
the
case
was...
from
the
student,
she
did
not
know...
when
the
approaches
by
the
teacher
were
merely
verbal,
in
the
form
of
insinuations
and
suggestions...
he
was
beginning
his
concentrated
campaign
to
seduce
her.
she
did
not
know...
she
did
not...
i'm
sorry.
she
did
not
know
to
whom
she
could
turn.
she
did
not
know
that
there
were
procedures
that...
she
did
not
know
that
there
was
a
complaint
procedure,
and
she
would
have--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--but
if
she
had
known
that
there
was
a
complaint
procedure...
i
mean,
that
was
at
that
point,
i
would
suggest
to
you,
a
mild
form
of
sexual
discrimination
in
the
form
of
harassment
because
of
the
suggestive
nature
of
the
remarks.
if
she
had
known
about
it
she
would
have
complained,
she
said,
and
if
she
had
complained
and
effective
action
had
been
taken
at
that
point,
then
her
damages
would
be
much
different
and
basically
we
would
not
be
in
court
at
all,
much
less
here.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
she
was
13
when
she
met
the
teacher.
he
was...
she
was
approximately
14
when
he
began
making
these...
not
approximately.
she
was
14
when
he
began
making
these
suggestive
remarks,
and
the
relationship
became
physical
before
she
became
15
and
ended
when
she
was
15.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
of
course
she
knew
that.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
of
course
she
knew
that,
but
she
didn't
know
those
people
personally.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
and
that
is
often
going
to
be
the
case.
there
are
often
going
to
be
parents
who
had
the
initiative
to
go
and--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
that
is
correct.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
yes.
it
makes
a
big
difference.
but
i
suggest
to
you...
and
here's
one
of
the
reasons
that
it...
that
the
text,
or
rather
the
context
of
title
ix,
the
schools
dealing
with
students
of
all
ages,
is
important...
an
important
consideration.
it
would
make
a
big
difference
the
older
and
more
sophisticated
the
student
was
toward
imposing
on
her
a
duty
to
utilize
the
complaint
procedures,
but
if
you're
talking
about
a
7
or
8-year-old,
as,
for
example,
was
considered
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
case
called
canutillo,
then
you
have
obviously
completely
different
considerations.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
and
may
i
also
assume
in
my
answer
to
you
that
there's
no
thing
so
flagrant
about
the
behavior
of
the
teacher
and
student
that
a
reasonable
person
would
become
suspicious.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
yes.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
it
does
make
a
difference,
but
because
we
are
talking
about
14's
and
15-year-olds,
i
think
it
makes
less
of
a
difference
than
it
might
for
an
adult
in
the
workplace
under
title
vii.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
well,
that's
why
it's
a
harder
case,
but
i
would
like
to
come
back
to
say--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--the
theory
of
the
difference
is
that
you
cannot
expect
even
14,
15-year-old
girls
to
have
the
same
presence
of
mind,
the
same
degree
of
initiative,
the
same--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--yes.
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
the
other
theory,
and
this
would
depend
on,
again,
the
factual
context.
the
other
theory
would
depend
on
whether
the
sexual
discrimination
is
at
the
hands
of
a
teacher
who
is
exploiting
his
educational
control
and
authority
over
the
student.
it
would
not
lead
to
liability
in
a
situation
involving
pure
harassment,
it
would
not
lead
to
liability--
mr.
terry
l.
weldon
--thank
you.
