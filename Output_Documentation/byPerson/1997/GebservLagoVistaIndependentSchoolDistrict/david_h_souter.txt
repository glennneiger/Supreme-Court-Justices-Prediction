justice
david
h.
souter
but,
what
about
the
supposed
constitutional
distinction
between
them?
i
mean,
the
argument
is
being
made
on
the
other
side
that
under
what
is
in
effect
a
spending
power,
piece
of
spending
power
legislation,
an
obligation
cannot
be
imposed
upon
the
government
that
takes
the
money,
which
is
not
very
clearly
spelled
out.
and
if
the
standard
of
liability
for
the
employer
is
not
clearly
spelled
out,
then
the
only
standard
that
can
be
applied
is
that
which
necessarily
would
be
applied
if
there's
going
to
be
liability
at
all,
i.e.
in
this
case
actual
knowledge.
what's
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying
that
there
were
regulations
at
the
time
in
question
here
that
indicated
that
the
standard
of
employer
liability
for
employee
conduct
would
be
something
different
from
actual
knowledge?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
did
they
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
draw
any
distinction
between
the
significance
of
the
spending
clause
for
primary
liability...
i.e.,
the
liability
of
the
employee,
or
the
conduct--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
could
give
rise
to
liability
and,
on
the
other
hand,
the
significance
of
the
spending
clause
argument
for
determinations
of
imputed
or
vicarious
liability?
are
the
implications
different
in
those...
for
those
two
different
questions?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
the
theory
of
the
difference?
the
theory
of
the
difference
is,
the
employer
has
done
all
that
the
employer
could
do,
and
therefore
it
would
be
unfair
to
impose
liability
on
any
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
said
it
would
make
a
difference,
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
theory
of
the
difference
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
understand
that,
but
from
the
employer's
standpoint,
once
the
employer
has
promulgated
the
perfect
policy
in
the
world--
justice
david
h.
souter
--you
say
it
makes
a
difference,
and
is
it
because
the
employer
has
done
all
the
employer
can
do,
or
is
there
some
other
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
--one
answer
possibly
to
the
spending
clause
argument
is
that
until
there
was
some
kind
of
an
adjudication
you
didn't
know
that
there
would
necessarily
be
a
private
cause
of
action.
i
think
everybody
accepts
that.
until
there
was
some
kind
of
an
adjudication
the
district
wouldn't
necessarily
know
what
kind
of
primary
liability
would
necessarily
give
rise
to
liability,
what
kind
of
primary
action
would
give
rise
to
liability.
but
any
school
district
is
certainly
deemed
to
know
that
because
it
acts
through
its
employees,
its
liability,
if
there's
going
to
be
liability,
is
going
to
be
dependent
on
some
sort
of
theories
of
imputed
responsibility,
and
you
did
know
that,
and
you
didn't
know
a
court
adjudication
to
tell
you
that
you
at
least
ran
the
risk
of
liability
imputed
on
the
usual
principles
of
agency.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
that
an
adequate
answer,
then,
to
your
spending
clause
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you...
we're
not
at
the
point
of
asking
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
cause
of
action.
we're
not
at
the
point
of
asking
what
kind
of
primary
conduct
on
the
part
of
an
employee
would
give
rise
to
liability.
we're
simply
at
the
point
of
saying,
how
do
you
get
from
the
employee's
action
to
the
employer,
and
you
say
yes,
we
all
understand
that
the
agency
relationship
and
the
rules
that
define
it
will
govern
that
liability.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
but
that's
not
a
spending
clause
argument.
that's
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that's
an
agency
law
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand.
