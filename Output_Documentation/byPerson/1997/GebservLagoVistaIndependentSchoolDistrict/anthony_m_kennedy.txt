justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
indicated
that
because
of
this...
the
spending
clause
nature
of
this
act
that
the
municipality
or
the
governmental
entity
must
be
aware
of
the
conditions
under
which
its
funds
might
be
cut
off.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me,
if
that's
so,
that
it
is
very
difficult
to
say
that
they
accepted
the
funds
knowing
that
they
would
be
cut
off
when
there
was
some
act
occurring
of
which
they
had
no
knowledge.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
somewhat
as
in
the
last
case,
that
this
egregious
criminal,
outrageous
conduct,
everyone,
including
the
student,
would
know
that
the
board
wouldn't
tolerate
for
a
second.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
she's
not...
that's
not...
the
gravamen
of
her
complaint
were
not
the
initial
overtures.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that's
true,
as
you've
indicated
with
any
corporate
or
fictional
entity,
but
in
this
case
the
whole
thrust
of
title
ix
is
that
there
must
be
a
policy
or
program,
and
now
you're
saying
that
the
school
can
be
held
liable
for
something
that
it
knew
nothing
about.
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
almost
an
a
fortiori
case,
as
suggested
by
justice
scalia's
line
of
questioning,
for
a
monell
type
of
requirement
that
the
city
or
the
school
district
has
to
have
a
policy
that
contradicts
this
program,
and
in
this
case
it
didn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
point
is,
how
do
we
make
the
implied
right
of
action
that
we've
invented
parallel,
consistent
with
the
terms
of
the
statute
that's
being
enforced--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
it
seems
to
me
this
is
an
easier
case
for
excusing...
for
having
a
monell
type
liability
than
1983.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
he
used
his
position
as
a
teacher,
and
it
was
a
course
in
which
she
was
one
of
the
only
or
very
few
students,
and
some
of
this...
the
initial
encounters,
of
course,
occurred
on
the
campus.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
concede
that
we
use
agency
principles,
as
we
did
in
the
last
case,
to
determine
when
the
district
is
liable
under
title
ix?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
you
say
here,
you
mean
to
your
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--not
to
title
ix
funding.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would
have
no...
you
would
have
no
problem
in
our
applying
the
agency
restatement
principles--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--to
determine
the
district's
liability
and
to
determine
when
they
knew,
including
constructive
knowledge?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
i
thought
they
were
under
agency
law?
they
i
wouldn't
be
applying
agency
principles
to
title
ix.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
the
only
difference...
the
difference
basically
is
the
difference
in
the
amount
of
risk.
the
chances
of
having
a
franklin
type
principal
are
low.
the
chances
of
having
a
janitor
doing
something
wrong
are
much
higher.
i
mean,
that's
the
distinction,
isn't
there?
we're
will...
you're
in
effect
saying,
look,
we're
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
a
franklin
situation
and
still
take
the
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we're
not
going
to
be
willing
to
run
the
risk
of
the
janitor
situation.
