ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
the
court
of
appeals'
erroneous
restriction
in
this
case
of
the
court's
customary
remedial
powers
that
this
court
recognized
in
franklin
to
award
all
appropriate
remedies
in
a
case
of
sexual
harassment
discrimination
under
title
ix.
the
court
of
appeals
here
held
that
damage
awards
would
be
appropriate
only
if
a
higher
ranking
employee
knew
of
the
harassment
and
failed
to
stop
it.
the
absence
of
explicit
notice
by
a
high
ranking
official
should
not
automatically
insulate
the
recipient
from
liability.
this
is
particularly
true
where,
as
here,
the
district
did
not
have
a
policy
to
prohibit
discrimination
or
a
procedure
for
effective
reporting
of
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
the
differences
between
title
ix
and
section
1983
demonstrate
that
that
would
not
be
an
appropriate
application.
first
and
foremost,
the
reasons
underlying
the
1983
standard,
according
to
this
court's
opinions,
are
rooted
in
the
text
of
section
1983
and
its
history,
and
the
text
of
1983
says
any
person
who
causes
another
to
be...
have
their
rights
violated
shall
be
subject
to
suit.
this
text
of
title
ix
is
very
different.
it
is
a
condition
on
receipt
of
federal
funds.
a
recipient
receives
those
funds
and
knows
that
under
that
program
and
activity,
under
its
programs
and
activities
there
cannot
be
a
denial
of
admission,
exclusion
from
the
benefits
of
vacation,
or
discrimination
under
that
program
based
on
sex.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but
your
honor,
a
recipient...
this
school
district,
just
like
any
other
entity
that...
can
only
act
through
human
agents,
and
any
discrimination
under
its
program
activities
is
going
to
be
carried
out
by
its
human
agents,
and
there
is
no
reason
to
deviate.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
your
honor,
in
addition
to
the
text
of
section
1983,
which
is
remarkably
different
from
title
ix,
there
is
also
the
history,
and
what
led
this
court--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
as
my
colleague
mentioned
we've
crossed
that
bridge
and,
in
fact,
acts
by
congress
since
then
have
reinforced
the
breadth
of
title
ix
and,
as
you...
your
concurrence
in
franklin
pointed
out,
congress
enacted
a
statute
to
abrogate
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
there
specifically
refers
to
legal
remedies.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
think
the
other--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
so.
what
the
department
of
education--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
but
i
have
to
qualify
that
there
is
a
statutory
requirement
placed
on
the
department
of
education
to
make
preliminary
steps
of
voluntary
conciliation
because
of
the
extreme
nature
of
cutting
off
funds,
and
what
the
court
has
recognized
is
that
a
private
damage
remedy
stops
short
of
that
and
also
serves
another
function
of
title
ix,
and
that's
its
remedial
purpose.
we
believe
that
when
there's
a
violation
of
title
ix,
as
this
court
said
in
franklin,
the
presumption
is
that
all
appropriate
remedies
apply
and
there's
no
basis
for
restricting
courts'
authority
to
do
that.
and
i
just
want
to
address
the
concern
about
the
amount
of
damages
that
justice
ginsburg
brought
up
with
that
cap
under
title
vii.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
to
realize
that
there
are
other
damages
remedies
that
can
be
obtained
against
school
districts...
for
example,
title
vii...
and
there
is
now
that
cap,
and
there
could
certainly
be
a
guidance
for
courts
to
look
to,
but
along
with
the
inherent
power
of
courts
to
order
remedies
is
often
the
inherent
authority
to
remit
damages.
we
also
would
point
out--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
the
concern
underlying
the
court's
opinions
about
spending
clause
statutes
is
notice
to
a
recipient.
the
language
of
title
ix
is
quite
clear
that
discrimination
that's
based
on
sex
is
prohibited,
and
in
franklin--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we
would--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
urge,
though,
that
actually
the
focus
on
the
text
of
title
ix
is
broader
than
title
vii's
antidiscrimination
prohibition.
those
concerns
about
admission
policies
and
denying
educational
benefits,
those
are
referenced
in
other
clauses
of
title
ix
in
addition
to
prohibiting
a
person
from
being
excluded
from
participation
in,
which
would
be
an
admission
policy
that
the
district
level
at
the
policy
level
would
clearly
be
carrying
out,
or
denying
someone
the
benefits
of
an
educational
program.
there's
also
the
prohibition
about...
against
being
subjected
to
discrimination
under
a
program
or
activity,
and
again,
this
is
an
entity
that
only
can
carry
out
its
programs
and
activities
through
its
agents,
and
there's
no
justification
to
deviate
from
the
normal
background--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--principles
for
finding--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
the
other
reason,
the
only
reason
that
the
courts
have
given,
other
than
the
text
of
section
219(2)(d)
for
imposing
that
policy,
was
the
history
of
the
rejection
of
the
sherman
amendment
to
the
1871
act,
and
that
was...
you're
looking
at
congressional
intent
and
what
congress
intended.
at
the
time
that
title
ix
was
enacted
it
could
not
possibly
have
been
relying
on
the
monell
standard
because
monell
was
not
decided.
in
1972,
when
title
ix
was
enacted,
monroe
v.
pape
was
on
the
books,
so
there
was
no
intent
of
congress--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
it's
what
the
court
said
in
franklin--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
the
task
of
this
court
is
to
define
congressional
intent
to
the
best
it
can,
and
in
franklin,
recognizing
the
implied
cause
of
action,
it
looked
to
the
background
principles
against
which
congress
enacted
title
ix,
and
that
was
the
presumption
of
all
appropriate
remedies.
congress
could
certainly
take
it
upon
themselves,
as
they
did
in
other
antidiscrimination
statutes,
to
set
a
cap.
that
would
be
a
policy
matter.
would
it
depend,
for
example,
on
the
number
of
employees,
as
the
cap
under
title
vii
does,
or
the
amount
of
funds
that
the
school
receives,
or
the
amount
of...
the
size
of
the
student
population?
those
are
matters
for
congress,
and
here,
relying
on
cannon
and
franklin,
the
court
has
recognized
that
that
presumption
of
all
appropriate
relief
including
damages,
should
apply
under
title
ix.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
it's
certainly
not
the
actual
knowledge
standard
that
the
court
of
appeals
imposed.
at
least
it
would
be
a
knew
or
should
have
known
standard,
and
that's
what
the
policy
is
about.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
in
many
ways,
your
honor.
they
are
educators.
part
of
the
problem
is,
to
let
students
know
about...
other
teachers
knew
about
this
that
could
have
reported
it
if
there
had
been
a
procedure
in
place,
other
students
had
heard
about
comments,
there
was
the
inadequate--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--that
could
be
a
very
significant
factor,
and
it
may
undermine
theories
of
knew
or
should
have
known.
certainly
liability
also
may
be
a
defense
to
an
aided
by
theory,
depending
if
the
plaintiff
had
any
other
evidence
that
she
brought
forth.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
