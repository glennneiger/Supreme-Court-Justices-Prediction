--suppose
that
a
teacher...
suppose
the
school
district
receives
a
grant
for
a
french
program,
and
there
are
two
or
three
students
interested,
and
the
teacher
says,
you
know,
i
just
don't
want
to
teach
a
woman.
i'll
teach
the
men,
but
i
don't
want
to
teach
a
woman.
is
the
school
district
liable?
i
mean,
they'd
be
horrified
when
they
find
out
about
it,
but
that's
just
this
teacher's
quirk,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
well,
there's
one
person
who
knows
about
it
who
is
a
school
department
official,
who
absolutely
knows
about
it.
that's
the
teacher.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
teacher
decides
who
comes
into,
say,
her
class,
if
it's
a...
i
mean,
doesn't
she?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
it
happens
to
be
the
superintendent
who
on
his
own
is
teaching
that
class.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
dividing
it
according
to
the
rank
of
the
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
is
there...
is
there
anything
in
the
law
that
says
the
teacher
is
down
there
with
the
janitor,
but
the
superintendent
is
up
there
with
the
governor,
i
mean,
or
whatever,
i
mean--
[laughter]
what
is
it
in
the
law
that
creates
that
division?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
if
it's
a--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
are
we
supposed
to
decide
that?
i
mean,
what's
the
ground,
then,
for
figuring
that
out?
i
mean,
how
would
we...
i
mean,
what's
the
key
to
that?
i
had
thought
your
answer,
your
answer
to
me
was
the
law
of
agency,
which
surprised
me
a
little
bit.
i
would
think
that
you'd
want
something
like
a
monell
policy
rule.
