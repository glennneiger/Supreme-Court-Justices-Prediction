justice
ruth
bader

may
i
ask,
to
the
extent
to
which
title
vii
would
be
the
model,
do
you
accept
that
the
statutory
caps
that
are
in
title
vii
would
apply
under
title
ix?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
it's
not
there
now,
and
yet
this
title
ix
tells
us
very
little,
so
we
look...
we
fill
in
the
gaps,
i
think
you
suggest,
by
looking
to
the
law
built
up
under
title
vii,
so
one
question
was,
but
you
wouldn't
take
the
caps
from
the
statute?
i
guess
that's...
your
answer
is
no,
not
unless
congress
imposed
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
judicial...
we...
we
have
crafted
this
claim,
and
so
we
have
to
give
it
some
content,
too,
because
where
else
are
we
going
to
look?
congress
hasn't
done
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i...
so
i...
well,
one
thing
to
do
is
to
say,
we'll
do
this
the
same
way
as
title
vii,
so
we'll
incorporate
the
title
vii
case
law
and
the
title
vii
statutory
revisions,
but
you
say
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
she
didn't
tell
her
parents.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's...
in
the
one
case
the
children
told
their
parents
what
had
been
said
by
the
teacher.
the...
i
take
it
that
this
girl's
parents
did
not
go
what
was
going
on--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--until
they
were
caught
in
the
act,
so...
it's
not
so
clear
to
me
that
the
best
policy
in
the
world
would
have
been
used
by
this
young
woman,
but
suppose
there...
one
of
the
things
you
complain
about
is
that
there
was
kind
of
this
nebulous
policy.
you
didn't
know
who
was
the
right
person
to
complain
to.
suppose
there
was
just
the
right
kind
of
policy,
the
kind
that
nea
describes
in
its
brief,
and
yet
the
same
thing
went
on,
would
the
school
district
be
liable
if
it
made
its
best
efforts
to
have
as
clear
a
policy
and
as
clear
an
identification
of
the
person
in
charge
of
implementation?
would
that
have
made
any
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
take
this
case,
and
she's
14
and
15,
and
they
do
have...
they've
done
the
best
job
that
they
can
with
putting
a
policy
in
place,
telling
the
students
about
it,
telling
the
teachers
about
it,
identifying
the
right
official
to
call.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i'm
taking
this
case,
and
the
only
thing
that
i'm
changing...
see--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--one
of
the
things
you
said,
that
the
policy
was
very
fuzzy,
nobody
knew
who
to
call,
or
suppose
we
make
it
the
best
policy.
i
wanted
to
know,
as
i
asked
in
the
last
case,
does
it
make
any
difference?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
issue
of
what
kind
of
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
supervisory
employer
here,
the
teacher,
holds
the
school
district,
and
there
i
think
you
have
a
big
difference
between
on
the
beach,
open,
everybody
could
see
it,
and
here,
where
nobody
knew.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
could
a
school
district
ever
know
about
something
like
this?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
they
had
a
great
policy,
then
there
would
be
no
liability.
is
that
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
practically
how
often
the
cut
off
of
funding
has
been
used
as
distinguished
from
lesser
remedies?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
that's
a
rather
severe
sanction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
defeats
the
whole
purpose
of
the
funds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
funding
cut
off
isn't
automatic
anyway.
i
mean--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
would
certainly...
there'd
be
a
notice.
there'd
be
an
opportunity
to
come
into
compliance.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there'd
be
negotiation.
