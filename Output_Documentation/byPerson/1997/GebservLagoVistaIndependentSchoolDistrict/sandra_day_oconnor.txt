well,
you
know,
i
think
the
tough
question
we
need
to
answer
here
is
whether
a
suit
under
title
ix,
which
this
is,
i
think--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--should
be
governed
by
the
principles
of
title
vii
suits,
or
whether
there
is
some
different
standard
here
under
title
ix
because
essentially
it's
a
federal
financial
grant
program
under
title
ix,
and
it's
quite
possible
that
agency
principles
don't
apply
to
title
ix
at
all.
are
you
going
to
address
that
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
brinkmann,
i'm
not
sure
we
get
to
that
question
at
all.
this
is
a
spending,
funding
program
of
the
federal
government,
and
we
have
indicated
that
we
think
when
states
or
local
agencies
accept
money
under
a
spending
program
it
has
to
be
clear
what
the
conditions
are,
and
what
the
liabilities
would
be
in
accepting
that
money,
and
we're
struggling
in
the
preceding
case
with
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
liabilities
are
under
title
vii.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
certainly
isn't
clear
under
title
vii.
how
could
it
be
possibly
clear
under
title
ix
to
a
school
district
what
the
liability
might
be?
i
think
you
have
a
first
step
to
take.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
programs
and
activities
of
the
school.
i
think
it
speaks
in
terms
of
very
broad
concerns
about
schools
that
might
not
admit
both
sexes,
or
might
not
enable
them
to
have
physical
education
programs,
or
that
discriminate
in
never
hiring
a
teacher--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--who's
a
female,
or
something
like
that.
