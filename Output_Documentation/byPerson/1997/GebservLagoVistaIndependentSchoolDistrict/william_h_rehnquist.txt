we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1866,
alida
star
gebser
and
alida
jean
mccullough
v.
the
lago
vista
independent
school
district.
mr.
weldon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
some
showing
that
it
was
discriminatory?
because
i
read
many
of
the
statements
in
the
various
briefs
in
the
proceeding
and
there's
virtually
no
mention
of
discrimination.
there's
a
lot
of
mention
of
sexual
harassment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
in
oncale
we
said
it
wasn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
you
have
to
show
that
the
treatment...
not
only
that
the
treatment
was
harassing,
but
that
it
was...
you
were
treating
one
sex
on
a
basis
that
you
would
not
have
treated
the
other
sex.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
franklin
case
said
there's
a
private
cause
of
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
saying
that
it
would
be
enough
if
you
showed
there
was
just
harassment
of
a
student
by
a
teacher
of
a
different
sex?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
the
statute
says
you
have
to
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex.
you
have
to...
the
teacher
has
to
treat
students
of
one
sex
differently
from
another.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
of
her
sex?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
weldon.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jefferson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
lago
vista
is
in
travis
county,
near
austin?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
only
monell
case
in
which
we
talked
about
deliberate
indifference
was
somewhat
different
than
this.
the
standard
you
propose
now
would
be
more
favorable
to
a
plaintiff
than
a
straight
monell
standard,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jefferson.
the
case
is
submitted.
