so...
and
do
you--
--of
course,
it's
sort
of
swallowing
the
camel
and
straining
out
the
gnat
if...
inasmuch
as
the
statute
doesn't
even
show
on
its
face
that
there's
a
private
cause
of
action
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
really
believe
strongly
in
the
principle
that
spending
clause
impositions
upon
the
states
must
be
clearly
expressed,
there
wouldn't
be
a
cause
of
action
here
at
all,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
i'm
saying,
it's...
we're
sort
of
switching
the
music
if,
having
created
the
cause
of
action
in
the
face
of
its
nonexpression,
despite
the
fact
that
this
is
a
spending
thing,
we
suddenly...
we
get
very
picky,
i
suppose,
about
what
the
content
of
that
cause
of
action
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
cannon
was
decided
long
before
we
adopted
this
rule
about
spending
clause
certainties.
justice
antonin
scalia
quite
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
not
suggesting
going
back
on
it,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
in
our...
i'm
trying
to
help
you.
never
mind.
[laughter]
it
seems
to
me
an
argument
in
your
favor
that
we've
already
taken
the
step,
and
congress
has
accepted
it,
of
creating
this
cause
of
action
in
the
teeth
of
its
nonappearance
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we...
do
you
think
we
could
adopt
one
standard
of
liability
for
the
private
right
of
action
and
permit
hhs
to
use
a
different
standard
for
the
cutting
off
of
funds
under
title
ix,
or
do
we
have
to
go
in
lockstep
with...
i
mean,
assuming
we're
making
it
up,
as
justice
ginsburg
suggests,
do
we
have
to
make
it
up
in
lockstep
with
hhs,
or
could...
you
know...
do
you
understand
what
i'm
asking?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
if
you
do
x--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
are
liable
for
the
cutting
off
of
federal
funds
under
the
regulations
issued
by
the
secretary,
which
the
secretary
has
authority
to
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
authority
has...
the
secretary
has
no
authority
to
issue
regulations
about
private
causes
of
action,
which
we've
created.
does
our
private
cause
of
action
have
to
make
the
basis
of
liability
the
same
thing
that
the
secretary
says
is
the
basis
of
cutting
off
federal
funds?
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
we
have
to
follow
those
regulations,
you
say.
if
it's
a
violation
of
the
regs
it's
the
basis
for
liability
in
the
private
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
the
school
districts
bound
by
the
guidelines
to
the
extent
that
if
they
don't
follow
them
they
can
have
their
funds
cut
off?
i
thought
they
could.
justice
antonin
scalia
she's...
how
old
was
she
at
this
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
she
didn't
know
that
there
were
people
in
positions
of
authority
over
the
teacher
to
whom
she
could
complain,
like
a
school
principal?
did
she
know
that
the
school
principal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--had
authority
over
the
teacher?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
were
other
girls
who
were
also
approached
by
this
man
and
who
did,
indeed,
take
that
course,
didn't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
require
that
the
district,
in
order
to
be
liable,
have
a
policy
that
permits
discrimination,
that
affirmatively
permits
it?
the
way
the
statute
reads,
it
says
no
one
shall
be
excluded
from
participation
and
be
denied
the
benefits
of
or
be
subject
to
discrimination
under
any
educational
program
or
activity,
not
in
connection
with
it,
under,
and
i
thought
it
was
mainly
directed
at
educational
programs
that
allow
sports
for
boys,
no
sports
for
girls,
things
of
that
sort.
that
is
discrimination
under
the
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
why
shouldn't
we
apply
the
same
kind
of
a
test
we
apply
in
1983
cases,
that
there
has
to
be
a
policy
of
the
school
as
far
as
private
liability
is
concerned,
a
policy
of
discriminating?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
i
think
it's
reasonable
to
read
that
to
mean,
you
know,
in
accordance
with
the
policies
of
that
program.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
being
discriminated
against
under
the
program
if
the
program,
by
policy,
does
not
treat
you
equally.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
argument
was
made
in
1983
and
somehow
we've
stumbled
through.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
unsympathetic
to
your
arguments
based
on
the
text
of
title
ix
inasmuch
as
title
ix
doesn't
even
create
a
cause
of
action
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
accept
all
that,
but
we're
not
in
an
area
where
we're
bound
very
tightly
to
the
text.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
saves
your
case
very
well,
but
what
you're
saying
with
that
test
is
that
in
the
next
case,
when
one
coteacher
knew
about
it,
that's
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
the
district
has
to
act
through
its
agents,
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
coteacher's
an
agent.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
title
vii?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
not
liable
for
activity
of
this
sort
anyway
under
different
provisions,
1983,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
monell
like.
it's
a
little
less
than
monell,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
on
the
safe
side
of
it,
so
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
ask
for
more
than
you
need?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
it's
the
causality
element.
justice
antonin
scalia
had
that
policy
made
a
difference,
though,
you
agree
that
not
having
that
policy
in
place
would
automatically
make
you
liable?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
said
before
that
you
thought
we
had
to
apply
the
same
standards
for
a
violation
of
the
funding
regulations
as
we
must
apply
for
liability
under
the
personal
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
believe
that
or
not?
if
so,
when
you
violate
the
regulation
you
are
automatically
subject
to
suit
and
the
only
question
is
one
of
causality,
which
will
usually
have
to
go
to
the
jury,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
would
be
a
jury
question,
wouldn't
it,
whether...
whether
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--failure
to
have
the
5,
10-day,
whatever
it
is,
was
a
cause
of
the
injury
here,
and
if
it
was
you'd
be
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then
you're
saying
you
don't
really
think
that
we
should
apply
the
same
standard
for
the
cut
off
of
funding
that
we
apply
for
personal
liability,
or
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
know,
monetary
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
which
are
reasons
why
you
wouldn't
want
the
same
standard
for
the
two,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
one
is
optional.
the
other,
you're
socked
with
a
lawsuit,
with
no
choice.
