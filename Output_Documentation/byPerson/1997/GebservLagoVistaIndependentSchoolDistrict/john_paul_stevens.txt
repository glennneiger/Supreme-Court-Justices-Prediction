justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
this
question,
and
of
course,
in
cannon
we
held
that
congress
implicitly
did
intend
a
remedy.
we
didn't
say
a
word
about
creating
any
elements
of
causes
of
action
or
substantive
liability.
that
isn't
made
up.
that's
all
what
we
thought
congress
meant,
and
is
there
any
difference
between
the
standard
that
would
be
applied
for
revocation
of
funds
under
the
congressional
standard
as
implemented
by
regulations
and
the
standard
that
should
be
applied
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
arguing
that
on
these
facts
the
funds
could
be
revoked
for
this
school
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
government
could
have
withheld
funds
in
the
future
for
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
think
they
could
have?
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore
you
are
acknowledging
the
school
district
violated
the
statute
and
the
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
no,
i
mean
under
your
view
of
the
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
there's
a
difference
in
standards
between
an
attempt
by
the
government
to
withhold...
revoke
your
funding
on
the
one
hand
and
a
private
damage
action
on
the
other?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much
in
federal
funds
did
you
receive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
suppose--
--but
you
do
know
that
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
have
to
say
that
you
do
know
that
now,
after
franklin,
if
your
principal
acted
the
way
that
the
principal
in
franklin
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
a
risk
that
you
might
have
liability
greater
than
the
amount
of
money
you
receive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
jefferson,
will
you
help
me
out
on
one
point?
i'm
frankly
a
little
mixed
up
on
it.
it
seems
to
me
your
opponent
argued,
or
the
briefs
argued
that
the
school
district
violated
the
regulations
because
it
didn't
have
an
adequate
policy
in
place,
and
if
that
were
true,
and
if
it
conceivably
would
give
rise
to
cut
off
of
funds,
why
wouldn't
the
failure
to
promulgate
adequate
regulations
also
justify
a
remedy
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
now,
stick
with
me
on
the...
do
you
agree
or
disagree
that
there
was
a
violation
of
agency...
federal
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
were
those
regulations
in...
was
that
policy
in
place
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
is
it
true
that
some
of
the
conduct
preceded
the
regulation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
some
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
what's
your
response
to...
say
you
have
a
defense
after
the
regulations
went
into
effect.
what
is
your
defense
under
the
argument
that
i
repeated
to
the
pre
regulation
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
that
pre
franklin
policy
comply
with
the
federal
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
how
relevant,
if
it
is
the
fact
that
during
a
portion
of
the
period
there
was
a
failure
to
comply
with
federal
regulations,
how
relevant,
if
at
all,
is
that
to
the
problem
before
us?
