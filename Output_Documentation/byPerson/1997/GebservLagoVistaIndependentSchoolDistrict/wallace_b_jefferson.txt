mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
frank
waldrop's
acts
were
criminal
in
the
state
of
texas,
forbidden
by
standards
issued
by
the
texas
education
agency,
repugnant
to
policies
actually
adopted
by
the
lago
vista
independent
school
district,
and
morally
repulsive
to
everyone
in
this
courtroom.
his
conduct
very
properly
landed
him
in
jail.
prior
to
his
apprehension,
waldrop
had
managed
to
keep
his
sins
concealed.
no
one
at
the
district
was
aware
of
these
acts.
no
one
in
the
school
administration
knew
about
it.
no
teachers
knew
about
it.
there
were
no
rumors
among
the
teachers,
or
the
faculty,
or
the
staff.
there
was
no
gossip.
all
of
the
conduct
we're
talking
about
here
occurred
off
campus.
he
did
not
physically
touch
her
in
the
school,
not
once.
he
did
not
use
school
facilities
to
accomplish
his
mission.
he
did
not
engage
in
sexually
explicit
conversation
on
the
campus.
no
one
but
he
and
his
victim
knew
of
the
child
abuse
until
he
was
caught
in
the
act,
in
public,
by
a
police
officer.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well,
certainly
their
first
introduction
was
in
the
context
of
the
school
setting,
but
that's
all
you
have.
that's
all
you
have.
i
mean,
the
teaching
role...
it's
sort
of
like
the
first
case,
and
i
agree
with
the
city
in
the
first
case.
what
the
teacher
did
here
was
criminal.
there
is
no
way
in
the
world
that
anyone
could
assume
that
he
was
acting
within,
any
way
within
the
scope
of
his
authority,
or
that
the
district
said,
this
is
acceptable.
now,
lago
vista's
reaction
when
it
was
first
notified
of
this
relationship
was
swift
and
severe.
the
superintendent
personally
marched
into
the
jail
and
delivered
papers
to
the
inmate,
suspending
him
from
any
contact
with
the
school.
as
soon
as
the
lawyers
told
him
due
process
was
satisfied,
the
superintendent
then
marched
into
the
psychiatric
hospital
and
gave
him
his
termination
papers.
waldrop
would
not
set
foot
in
the
lago
vista
school
again,
and
well
before
it
became
an
issue
in
this
case,
back
in
april
of
1989,
the
district
had
adopted
a
policy
forbidding
sexual
harassment
by
employees.
that's
at
420
of
the
record.
and
within
months
of
this
court's
watershed
opinion
in
franklin,
the
school
district
adopted
a
policy
stating
expressly
that
district
employees
shall
not
engage
in
sexual
harassment
of
students.
that's
at
417,
and
that
was
in
1992.
now,
the
district's
policy
of
nondiscrimination,
general
policy
of
nondiscrimination
like
the
statute
provides
was
disseminated
to
the
students
and
to
the
parents
in
the
student
teacher
handbook.
that's
in
the
record
at
page
389.
now,
we
understand
why,
in
the
briefing,
and
here
this
morning
in
oral
argument,
the
petitioner
would
like
to
demonize
the
school
district,
but
we
are
confident
that
when
you
look
at
the
record
it
will
not
support
that
attempt.
the
real
question
is
whether
title
ix
requires
the
district
to
answer,
in
damages,
for
criminal
conduct
of
an
employee
when
the
district
lacks
notice,
actual
or
constructive,
of
the
crime,
and
whether
the
district
had
any
hint
that
its
acceptance
of
a
relatively
nominal
amount
of
federal
funds
would
potentially
expose
it
to
limitless
actual
and
punitive
damages,
potentially,
and
we
say
no
for
several
reasons.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
don't
think
they
could
legitimately,
but
under
their
argument...
under
their
argument
this
is
a
violation
of
title
ix.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
oh,
no.
no.
no,
because
it's
not
a
violation
of
title
ix
to
begin
with.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
no.
i
think
the
same
standard's
going
to
have
to
apply
to
both.
now--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--justice
ginsburg,
there
is
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
record,
and
i
do
not
know
personally
what
those
statistics
would
hold.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes,
it
is.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
indeed
it
does,
and
that
leads
to
another
point
of
the
spending
clause
legislation.
now,
if...
if,
because
some
criminal,
unbeknownst
to
anyone
in
the
district...
i
mean,
no
rumors,
no
circulation
of
gossip
or
anything
like
that,
is
going
to
be
cut
off
from
federal
funds
and
subject
to
potentially
unlimited
damages...
i
mean,
the
verdicts
in
cases
like
these
are...
and
it's...
there's
no
reason...
i
mean,
we
know
why
they
are.
they're
huge.
they're
in
the
millions
of
dollars.
now,
you
take
a
school
district
like
lago
vista
that
had
in
the
year
that
these
activities
were
occurring
about
646
students
in
the
whole
district,
that's
accepting,
what,
less
than...
around
$100,000
in
federal
funds,
whose
whole
budget
is
only
about
$1.6
million--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--yes,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
why
would
a
district
even
accept
the
money,
and
that's...
the
purpose
of
our
bringing
up
the
spending
clause
is,
we
need
to
know.
the
districts
around
the
country
need
to
know
that
in
exchange
for
receiving
a
nominal
amount
of
federal
funds...
a
judgment
could
wipe
out
the
whole
district.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it
was
about,
approximately
120,000,
$120,000
back
in
the
1992-'93
school
year,
and
that's
in
that...
the...
you
can
find
it
in
the
texas
education
agency's
snap
book,
snapshot
that's
in
the
national
association's
brief,
and--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--in
the
public
record
in
that
year,
in
1992-'93,
the
entire
budget
was
only
about
$1.6
million.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
can
agree
with--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
i
can
agree
with
that.
i
mean,
everyone
knows
that
in
districts,
as
with
employment,
you
know,
the
corporation
acts
through
its
employees,
the
district
acts
through
its
employees,
and
there's
no
question
about
that,
so
that
yes,
we
did
know
that
if
there
was
going
to
be
liability
it
would
have
to
be
routed
somehow
through
the
action
of
its
employees.
franklin
is--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--no.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well,
if
the
rules
that
define
it
govern
that
liability,
there
is
no
liability
here
in
an
agency
relationship
context,
because
what
was
done
here
was
a
criminal
act
that
was
completely
away--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--oh,
it
is.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
believe
it
is
a
spending
clause
argument.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
okay.
i
believe
it's
a
spending
clause
for
this
reason,
and
let's
compare
this
case
to
franklin.
you
know,
franklin
is
a
case
where
the
district...
where
the
teachers
and
the
staff
and
the
administration
knew
that
this
conduct
was
going
on,
knew
that
sexual
harassment
was
taking
place.
this
court,
i
believe,
held
in
franklin
that
that
is
intentional
conduct
of
the
district
itself.
yes,
they're
acting
through
employees.
i
mean,
they've
got
to
act
through
employees,
but
when
it
became
known
to
the
district
itself,
no
action
was
taken.
in
fact,
not
only
was
no
action
taken
to
prevent
it,
action
was
taken
to
silence
the
victim
in
that
case.
well,
that's
a
case
of
intentional
conduct,
and
in
guardians
you
said
intentional
conduct
can
make
the
district
liable,
even
if
it's
spending
clause
legislation,
and
so
that's
the
difference.
here,
there
is
no
intentional
conduct
whatsoever.
there
is
no
notice
whatsoever
to
the
district,
and
what
the
employee
was
doing,
what
this
teacher
was
doing
was
a
crime,
was
a...
it
should
have
landed
him
in
jail,
and
it
did
land
him
in
jail.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
no,
because
i
think
that
the...
the...
a
coteacher
wouldn't
satisfy
the
test
of
actual
knowledge
to
the
district.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--it
does,
but
in
order
to
hold
the
district
liable
you've
got
to
show
that
the
district...
in
franklin,
the
principal
knew.
it
wasn't
just
the
teachers,
although
they
did,
and
they
were
trying
to
get
this
information
to
the
principal.
the
principal
was
taking
it
in
and
then
conducting
a
fraudulent
investigation,
didn't
even
look
into
it,
so
there
you
have
someone
at
the
level
that
the
fifth
circuit
said
would
be
responsible.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
don't
have
problems
with
the
court
using
some
form
of
agency
principles.
my
problem
is
that
the
principles
that
they're
relying
on,
219(2)(d)
and
this
agency...
and
this
aided
in
accomplishing,
they
just
don't
apply
here.
they
have
no
application
here
whatsoever.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
to
our
case.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
to
our
case
is
what
i'm
saying,
that's
correct.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
when
i
say--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
there
is
no
such
thing
as
constructive
knowledge
under
title
ix
to
hold
the
district
liable.
that's
our
position,
and
so
agency
wouldn't
work--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--then
you'd
be
applying
simply
strict
liability,
and
we
say
for
sure,
we
say
that
this
court
should
declare
that
that's
not
the
test.
strict
liability
is
not
the
test
and
could
not
be
the
test,
and
the
reason
is,
if
you
apply
strict
liability
in
a
case
like
this,
or
in
cases
like
these,
not
just
ours,
you're
going
to
run
contrary
to
the
whole
purpose
of
title
ix.
we've
all
agreed
this
morning,
at
least
in
the
briefs
on
their
side
and
our
side,
that
this
is
spending
clause
legislation,
which
means
we're
talking
about
voluntary
acceptance
of
federal
funds.
the
district
can
either
accept
it
or
not.
if
the
district
knows
that
as
a
result
of
accepting
a
few
dollars
in
federal
funds
its
whole
budget
could
go
to
one
victim,
and
not
to
students
at
large
in
the
district,
well
then
the
district's
not
going
to
accept
those
funds--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--and
then
title
ix's
role
in
the
educational
process
will
be
gutted.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
if
there's
intentional
conduct
by
the
district,
yes.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes,
but
the
district
can
say
to
itself,
you
know,
we're
not
going
to
intentionally
sexually
abuse
a
minor
student,
and
we
know
that.
that's
not
going
to
happen.
and
so
yes,
they
can
take
the
funds
with
franklin
in
mind.
but
what
they
can't
do,
and
what
they
have
no
notice
of,
is
if
they
take
their
funds,
some
janitor
who
does
this
is
going
to
make
the
whole
district
liable,
or
some
employee
that
the
district
has
no
notice
of.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it's
not
willing--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i...
we...
the
district's,
and
this
district
in
particular
is
not
willing
to
take
the
risk
at
all
and
is
going
to
do
everything
it
can
to
prevent
that
sort
of
thing
from
happening,
including
background
checks
and
making
sure
that
people
it
hires
are
great
educators,
so
it's
not
a
matter
of,
well,
we're
going
to
accept
this
risk
because
we
know
this
thing's
going
to
happen.
it's
a
matter
of
human
nature.
this
thing
does
happen.
it's
a
terrible
and
it's
a
repugnant
and
repulsive
thing,
but
it
happens
in
this
country--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--and
the
question
is,
do
you--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--you
could
be.
under
1983
you
could
be,
if
you
meet
the
standards
in
monell.
a
school
district
like
lago
vista
could
certainly
be,
if
it
adopted
some
custom
or
policy
that
allows
this
to
happen,
or
if
there's
a
pattern
that
it
turns
a
blind
eye
to
and
lets
it
happen
over
a
course
of
the
year,
a
number
of
different
times,
there's
some
sort
of
pattern
to
it,
certainly
there
could
be--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
when
they
find
out
about
it--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--is
the
test.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
that's
not
enough.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
because
the
teacher
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
bind
the
district
to
any
policy
like
that.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes,
but
once
that
decision
is
made,
when
the
district
hears
about
it...
and
certainly
a
complaint
will
be
made
in
that
situation.
when
the
district
hears
about
it,
if
they
do
nothing,
or
if
they
try
to
cover
it
up
like
the
district
did
in
franklin,
then
there's
liability.
but
if
it's
just
one
teacher
in
one
class
making
that
statement,
no.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
if
it's
the
superintendent
i
think
there's
liability.
i
think
that--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i
am.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it's
going
to
be
this
court.
it's--
[laughter]
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
no--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--what
my
answer
is,
and
i
think
it...
i
think
what
the
fifth
circuit
did
was,
a
clear
rule,
a
clear
guide
to
the
court
and
to
the
circuits,
that
are
divided
right
now,
is
that
the
district
will
be
liable
if
someone
who
has
actual
knowledge
of
the
abuse
was
invested
by
the
school
board
with
the
authority
to
supervise
the
employee
and
the
power
to
take
action
to
end
the
abuse
and
didn't
take
that
action,
and
failed
to
take
remedial
action.
i
think
that
standard
is
the
standard
that
could
be
applied.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it's...
it
is
monell
like,
because
it
is
sort
of
a
deliberate
indifference
standard.
you've
got
someone
at
a
level,
a
high
up
enough
level
that
knows
and
has
the
discretion
to
make
decisions.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
it
would,
indeed.
indeed
it
would,
but
it's
one
that,
you
know,
the
court
is
asking
counsel
here,
what
is
the
clear
rule--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--yes.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
want
to
mention
one
additional
point
here,
and
the
solicitor
general
talks
about,
well,
you
know,
let's
have
this
constructive
knowledge
standard,
and
i
want
to
make
a
rather
procedural
point
here.
that
theory,
constructive
knowledge
based
on
comments
made
to
this
teacher,
by
the
teacher
to
other
students
in
the
past,
that
has
been
abandoned
by
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
i
don't
even
think
it's
part
of
the
case.
the
district
court
found
no
evidence
whatsoever
of
constructive
knowledge.
the
fifth
circuit
said
they're
not
complaining
about
constructive
knowledge
and
there's
no
evidence
of
it
here
anyway,
and
so
we
don't
have
to
address
it.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
if
i
can
answer
in
this
case--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--if
we're
talking
about
this
case,
the
student
here
knew
precisely
what
to
do
to
stop
this
activity,
and
she
testified...
i--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
i
disagree
in
this
sense.
franklin
was
decided
in
1992,
and
within
months
of
that
opinion,
that's
when
the
district
adopted
a
policy
of
saying,
sexual
harassment
of
students
means
this,
and
who...
and
here's
who
you
go
to
report
to.
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--in
part.
you
know,
in...
the
conduct
began
in
the
fall
of
1992.
this
court's
opinion
i
believe
was
sometime
during
that
fall
of
1992,
and
then
the
policies
were
in
place
by
october
of
1992.
this
conduct
continued
until
january
of
1993,
so
what
i'm
saying
is,
before--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--yes.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
yes.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
before
the
regulations
went
into
effect
we
had
a
policy
of
nondiscrimination,
which
is
what
title
ix
requires,
which
was
disseminated
to
the
students.
after
1992,
after
this
court's
decision
in
franklin,
the
world
changed.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i...
you
know,
i
think
there
was...
technically
the
answer
is
probably
not,
because
it
doesn't
say
within
5
days
you
must
report
it,
you
know,
a
reported
violation
has
to
be,
you
know,
submitted
to
a
committee,
and
within
10
days
a
decision,
so
that
sort
of
policy
was
not
in
place.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i
don't
think
it's...
i
don't
think
it's
relevant
and
again,
i
must...
the
reason
that
i
mentioned
what
the
petitioner's
knowledge
was
was
because
a
policy
in
this
case
would
have
made
absolutely
no
difference.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
there
is
a
causality
element,
that's
right,
in
this
case.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
no.
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well,
because
the--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--but
then
the
question
there
would
be
funding,
but
it
wouldn't
be
the...
it
wouldn't
be
bound
up
with
the
private
cause
of
action
for
the
petitioner
in
this
case.
yes,
there
could
be
a
cessation
of
funding.
i
don't
think
it
would
happen.
i
think
in
the
real
world
they're
going
to
give...
the
agency's
going
to
give
the
district
a
chance
of--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--the
jury--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--number
1,
i
don't
think
the
jury
would
get
this
question
to
begin
with--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--and
number
2,
i
don't
think
that
the
absence
of
a
policy
would
make
the
district
here
liable
for
the
criminal
conduct
of
a
teacher
that
the
district
knew
nothing
about.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
well--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--well,
except
your...
the
question
to
me
doesn't...
doesn't
get
into
what
happened
here
in
this
case.
i
mean--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--no.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
that's
correct.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
that's
correct.
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
i--
mr.
wallace
b.
jefferson
--i
take
your
point.
i
mean,
and
it's
true,
the...
there
is
the
possibility
of
compliance
under
title
ix.
if
there's...
you
know,
it
would
be
as
if,
as
in
franklin,
the
complaint
is
made
and
the
district
does
nothing
about
it.
if,
under
title
ix,
the
district
is
apprised
of
its
noncompliance
and
does
nothing
about
it,
well
then
the
severe
sanction,
you
know,
withdrawal
of
funding,
would
be
appropriate.
but
of
course,
you
know,
what
would
happen
in
that
situation
is
the
district
would
come
into
compliance
or
would
just
decide,
no
longer
do
we
need
federal
funds.
i
mean,
it
would
be
their
option.
and
so
again,
i
think
under
the
facts
of
this
case
the...
here,
the
absence
of
a
policy
makes
no
difference
whatsoever.
now,
the
other
thing
we
need
to
talk
about
is,
was
this
actually
sexual
discrimination
under
a
policy,
or
under
a
program
or
an
activity,
and
again,
we
say,
and
i'm
mirroring
some
of
the
comments
made
in
the
argument
before,
no.
what
happened
here
was
a
teacher
who,
to
all
intents
and
purposes
was
a
good
teacher,
but
who
did
a
criminal
act,
who
engaged
himself
in
an
act
that
was
private,
that
was
prurient,
that
was
criminal,
that
could
land
him
in
jail
and
did
land
him
in
jail.
that
is
not
in
any
way
associated
with
any
education
program
or
activity.
now,
what
counsel
say
on
this
side
is,
well,
you've
got
this
sort
of...
you've
got
this
sort
of
program
and
it's
got
to
be
implemented
by
agents,
and
the
agent
here
was
a
teacher,
and
so
therefore
there's
liability.
but
if
we
do
go
back
to
title
ix
and
the
congressional
intent,
when
you
look
at
title
ix,
what
they're
talking
about,
mr.
chief
justice,
as
you
mentioned,
is
things
like
discrimination
in
funding
of
sports,
or
employment
discrimination,
you
know,
after
a
decision
in
this
court.
that
sort
of
thing,
which
is
always
carried
out
by
agents
who
have
the
discretion
to
hire
and
fire
or
to
fund
or
not
to
fund,
it's
always
someone
who
has
the
sort
of
authority
that
we're
talking
about
who
needs
to
be
there
before
you
can
hold
the
district
liable.
what
happened,
and
what
makes
this
case
odd,
is
franklin,
and
cannon
before
it,
you
know,
adopting
a
whole
private
cause
of
action
and
then
this
court
becoming
in
effect
a
legislature.
we
keep
coming
back
to
the
court
for
new
rules
and
new
regulations...
well,
what
about
this,
your
honor,
and
what
about
that,
your
honor...
because
now
the
court
is
sitting
as
congress
should
have
sat
before,
if
it
wanted
to
find
this
cause
of
action,
this
private
cause
of
action.
the
sort
of
agent
that
they
contend
is
making
the
district
liable
is
not
proper,
because
the
agent
here
is
engaging
in
purely
criminal
activity.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we
would
ask
that
the
court
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
