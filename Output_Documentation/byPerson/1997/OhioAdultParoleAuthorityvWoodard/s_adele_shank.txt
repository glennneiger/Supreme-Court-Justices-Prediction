mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
respondent
eugene
woodard
asks
only
that
this
court
find
that
within
the
parameters
of
the
pleadings
there
may
be
some
set
of
facts
upon
which
he
may
prevail
and
that
this
case
be
remanded
to
determine
whether
such
set
of
facts
exists.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
we
are
bound
by
what's
in
the
pleadings
and
by
the
process
as
it
appears
in
the
record,
your
honor,
and
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
think
you're
asking
if
the
court
can
make
a
decision
on
those
facts
alone.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
and
i
agree,
it
has
to
be
some
process
that
you
can
conceive
within
the
procedure
that
is
present
here,
but
i
think
there
are
many
such
conceivable
fact
situations
that
may
or
may
not
be
able
to
be
proved
on
remand.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
your
honor,
that--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
it
was
remanded
with
respect
to
both
the
sixth
circuit's
analysis
of
evitts
v.
lucey
and
the
idea
that
clemency
is,
in
fact,
as
it
is,
an
integral
part
of
ohio's
criminal
justice
system
as
well
as
on
the
fifth
amendment
issue.
but,
of
course,
because
this
is
a
case
that
was
ruled
on
based
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
therefore
the
pleadings,
this
court
comes
to
it
as
if
it's
de
novo
review,
and
so
the
court
can
look
within
the
pleadings
as
broadly
as
it
chooses
to,
so
any
set
of
facts
that
the
court
can
conceive
would
be...
that
would
allow
due
process
to
apply--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--again,
justice
o'connor--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--yes,
absolutely.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
do.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
yes.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
certainly,
justice
o'connor,
the
court
can
do
anything
as
if
on
de
novo
review
within
the
parameters
of
the
pleadings.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
and
that
is
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
chief
justice
rehnquist,
it's
true
that
the
sixth
circuit's
opinion
surely
should
be
informative
and
helpful
to
the
court.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
but
it
is
my
understanding
that
the
court
can
clearly
look,
as
if
on
de
novo
review,
at
the
pleadings
and
determine
whether
or
not
there
are
other
problems
or
other
aspects
of
this
process
that
need
to
be
considered
in
order
to--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--and
it
could
very
well
be
that
the
court
would
choose
to
remand
for...
to
the
sixth
circuit
for
assessment
in
light
of
what
it
took
to
be
a
misunderstanding.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
certainly
the
court
may
choose
to
do
that.
you
are
obviously
not
required
to
do
so.
we
think
that
it
is
an
unconstitutional
condition,
and
i
hope
i
haven't
said
anything
to
make
you
think
i'm
saying
you
should
only
address
one
issue.
i'm
not.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
one
of
the
things
that
i'd
like
to
point
out
which--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--it's
absolutely
true
that
the
governor
has
complete
discretion
under
ohio's
clemency
processes.
however,
the
governor's
executive
discretionary
decisionmaking
authority
truly
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
we
are
looking
not
at
the
end
result,
which
is
the
decision
made
by
the
chief
executive
of
the
state,
but
rather
at
the
procedures
that
are
limiting
the
right
to
seek
clemency.
we're
looking
at
the
front
end
of
a
process.
as
this
court
noted
in
dumschat,
there
the
court
found
there
was
no
due
process
interest
in
that
end
result,
at
least
none
that
required
an
explanation
of
the
reasons
for
a
clemency
decision.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
the
court
found
that
there
were
no
due
process
liberty
interests
at
that
point.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
but
the
important
point
for
us
with
regard
to
dumschat
is
the
fact
that
the
court
noted
in
the
final
line
of
the
opinion
that
connecticut
had
a
state
right
to
clemency
and
there
had
been
no
breach
of
that
right.
now,
the
court
went
no
further,
but
the
fact
that
the
court
recognized
a
difference
between
the
end
result
of
the
executive
discretionary
decisionmaking
process
and
a
possible
difference
between
that
and
the
right
to
get
your
papers
on
the
governor's
desk
is
what
we
are
focusing
on
here.
the
other
thing
is
that
i
think--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
agree
with
what
you
just
read
from
dumschat,
and
i
think
that
what
is
important
about
it
is
that
it
does
focus
on
the
decision,
and
that's
what
this
court
said
there
isn't
an
interest
in.
at
the
end
of
this
process,
as
justice
ginsburg
noted,
we
are
moving
into
the
executive
discretionary
decisionmaking
process,
and
there,
the
court
is
right,
but
we
are
not
looking
at
that
end
of
it,
and
we're
not
looking
at
what
the
decision
is.
we
are
looking
at
the
right
to
apply
for
clemency
and
get
to
the
point
where
we
get
a
decision,
and
i
think
ohio--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--it's
a
right--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
okay,
justice
scalia,
we're
actually
presenting
four
different
grounds,
one
of
them
being
the
fact
that
the
state
has
created
a
liberty
interest
and
a
life
interest
in
clemency
in
ohio,
and
that
is
in
the
right
to
seek
it,
and
the
ohio
supreme
court
noted
in
weaver
v.
state
that
clemency
is
the
remedy
that
is
available
to
individuals
who
are
unable
to
achieve
redress
in
the
courts.
they
said
in
in
re
kline
that
ohio
defendants
who
can't
have
a
conviction
overturned
because
it's
beyond
judicial
process
have
a
right
to
apply
for
clemency.
on
top
of
that--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--we
are
saying
that
this
process
violates
that
statecreated
right
to
seek
clemency
in
that
particular
analysis.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--they
did
not
accept
that
position,
but
again,
i
would
like
to
put
forward,
your
honor,
that
we
were
on
motions
and
pleadings,
and
the
facts
hadn't
been
fully
explicated,
so
the
court
didn't
have
before
it
the
full
history
and
background--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--your
honor,
i
can
tell
you
from
reviewing
the
pleadings
that
the
cases
that
i've
just
cited
to
you,
in
re
kline
and
weaver
v.
state
were
not
before
the
court,
and
very,
very
little--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--your
honor,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
no,
they
were
not
included
in
the
briefing
at
that
point,
your
honor,
but
the
issue
was
included,
the
question
of
whether
there
was
a
state
right.
but
i
think
that
the
entire
process
has
been
truncated
by
the
fact
that
it
was...
that
the
court...
it's
here
before
the
court
without
sufficient
fact
development.
that's
why
a
remand
is
in
order.
were
the
court
to
send
it
back--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--justice
ginsburg,
we
agree
with
that.
we
think
that
it
is
possible
that
it
could
go
back
on
remand.
there
could
be
full
hearings,
and
there
could
be
factual
development
that
determined
that
in
fact
sufficient
due
process
protections
have
been
recognized,
but--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--that's
correct.
it--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--i
was
just
going
to
say,
it's
correct
we
would...
for
this
court
right
now
the
determination
has
to
be
whether
within
the
parameters
of
what's
before
it,
that
we
might
possibly
prevail
on
a
set
of
facts
that
could
be
established
on
remand,
and
so
what
you
suggested
earlier,
that
we
could
go
back
and
find
that
what
has
been
provided
is
sufficient,
is
a
very
real
possibility.
it's
certainly
not
what
we
believe,
but
it
is
possible,
and
it
could
happen.
so
there's
nothing
in
this
case
to
say
that
we
couldn't
go
back
and
find
ourselves
being
told
that
due
process
parameters
have
already
been
satisfied.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
or
will
be
under
the--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--that's
correct.
we
do
also
present
to
the
court
the
fact
that
there
is
a
federal
life
interest
protected
by
the
fourteenth
amendment
that
is
independent
of
the
other
issues
that
we've
presented,
the
other
types
of
interests,
and
that
that
was
not
present
in
dumschat,
and
that
it
independently
is
basis
alone
to
allow
this
court
to
make
the
decision
that
special...
that
this
special
proceeding
for
death
penalty
cases
impacts
that
life
interest
and
therefore
distinguishes
it
from
dumschat.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
first
that
the
life
interest
remains
fully
intact
as
long
as
a
person
is
alive.
i
mean,
the
fourteenth
amendment
right
to
life
that
is
protected
is
nothing
more
and
as
simple
as
the
right
to
be
alive
and
to
continue
to
live,
and
a
date
does
not
determine
when
that
right
that
is
protected
ends.
the
only
thing
that
ends
that
right
and
its
protection
under
the
constitution
is
actual
death.
so
the
life
interest,
unlike
liberty,
isn't
diminished
in
increments.
it's
not
diminished
by
having
been
placed
into
the
prison,
as
is
the
liberty
interest,
and
it
can't
be
diminished
in
bits
and
pieces.
it
exists
with
all
of
its...
in
its
fullblown
state
until
the
moment
of
death.
and
i
think
recently
this
court
recognized
that
in
its...
addressing
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
right
to
assisted
suicide.
there
the
court
even
cited
the
ohio
supreme
court,
saying
that
even
condemned
prisoners
have
the
right
to
protection
of
law
up
until
the
last
moment
of
life.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
that's
correct.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
that's
correct.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
have
looked
into
it,
and
i
think
that
there
are
some
arguments
about
veto.
i
mean,
that's
a
possibility,
although
there
are
different
remedies,
rather
than
going
back
to
the--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--sure.
there
are
a
number
of
factors
involved
in
it.
the
time
frame
is
that
if
you
have
not
managed
to
get
a
stay
when...
within
45
days
before
the
first
scheduled
execution
date
after
the
ohio
supreme
court
finishes
direct
appellate
review,
a
hearing
will
be
scheduled,
and
even
if
you
get
a
subsequent
stay...
in
this
case
the
stay
was
actually
granted
on
the
45th
day,
so
it's
one
of
those
counting
things.
they
decided
that
day
did
count
for
their
purposes,
and
we
would,
of
course--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
the
problem
is
more
complicated
than
that
because,
of
course,
the
petition...
i
mean,
the
respondent
in
this
case,
or
the
inmate
in
any
case
has
an
extremely
limited
control
on
that
timing.
you
can
file
for
a
stay,
but
there
are
many
exigencies
that
come
up
in
the
court
system
that
sometimes
it
takes
2
months
to
get
a
stay,
sometimes
you're
very
lucky
and
you
can
get
a
stay
within
a
week
or
2
or
3
days,
so
you
don't
have
control
over
the
timing
in
this
case
no
matter
how
it
is
handled.
but
part
of
the
reason
that
this
is
so
critical
is
that
whenever
this
particular
process
kicks
in
it
then
negates
the
opportunity...
well,
i
should
say,
negates
the
right
to
have
a
clemency
application
filed
by
the
inmate
and
have
it
considered.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
there's
nothing
in
the
procedure
that
says
that
that
could
not
be
done,
although
the
procedure
itself
is,
with
regard
to
the
interview
is
inherently
coercive,
counsel
is
specifically
prohibited
from
being
there,
in
this
case
we
had
3
days'
notice
and
counsel
would
not
have
had
an
opportunity--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
they
may
draw
an
adverse
inference
from
his
silence,
may
view
him
as
being
uncooperative,
and
go--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
but
it's
part
of
what
the
problem
is
with
the
choice
that
he
is
facing.
incriminating
him
if
he
chose
to
speak
and
then
those
matters
were
used
against
him--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--and
it's
possible,
too,
that
it
could
be
used
to
impeach
him,
and
the
silence
itself
could
at
least
be
attempted
to
be
used
for
impeachment
in
subsequent
criminal
proceedings,
so--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--well,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
if
clemency
were
to
be
handled
at
the
end
of
the
process
instead
of
at
this
premature
point
where
you
have
ongoing
litigation
and
future
litigation
as
a
right
still
in
front
of
you,
that
it
might
be
possible
that
a
procedure
that
set
some
time
limits
toward
the
end
of
the
process
would
meet
due
process.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
for
ohio's
purposes
it's
not
relevant
because
they
don't
put
these
restrictions
on
noncapital
defendants.
these
restrictions
and
these
time
frames,
this
mandatory,
this
forced
clemency
review
at
this
early
date
is
only
applied
in
capital
cases.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
part
of
the
problem
with
that
process,
is
that
if
a
prisoner
initiates
the
clemency
process,
if
he
exercises
that
state
right
we've
talked
to
you
about
seeking
clemency,
then
he's
made
some
choices
about
where
he
wants
to
go
and
the
statements
he's
making.
but
when
he
is
subjected
to
a
forced
process
at
a
time
when
he
is
still
in
litigation,
those
considerations
aren't
available
to
him.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
justice
scalia,
i
must
say
that
if
it
was
a
forced
process
at
some
time
i
think
that
perhaps
the
hypothetical
you're
proposing
would
have
application
to
noncapital
cases,
but
that's
not
the
situation
in
ohio.
noncapital
cases
aren't
subjected
to
that
standard.
they
aren't
forced
into
clemency
review
and,
of
course,
we
are
dealing
with
the
capital
case
here.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
think
that
at
least
under
the
parameters
that
we're
dealing
with
in
this
case
the
answer
would
be
yes,
because
the
right
to
seek
would
not
have
been
impaired.
as
long
as
the
state
doesn't
erect
a
barrier
to
getting
to
the
decisionmaker,
i
think
that
the
clemency
right
to
seek
has
been
observed.
part
of
the
problem
we
have
here
is
that
we
have
a
process
that
keeps
us--
ms.
s.
adele
shank
--i
don't
think
it
has
that
meaning
here,
because
the
meticulous
observation
of
rules
comes
from
that
line
of
cases,
meacham
and
the
prison
cases,
greenholtz,
some
of
the
cases
that
have
been
mentioned.
but
in
those
cases,
the
procedure
did
not
erect
a
barrier
either
to
getting
to
the
final
decisionmaker
even
in
dumschat,
even
in
the
prison
cases,
and
it
did
not
prevent
the
ultimate
decisionmaker
from
making
his
decision.
this
process
has
to
be
complied
with...
i
mean,
the
application
process
has
to
be
complied
with
for
the
governor
to
make
a
valid
decision,
and
it's
a
forced
process
that
once
it's
been
engaged
in,
its
initial
timing
denies
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
be
heard
at
a
meaningful
time
and
then
precludes
the
right
to
seek
when
it
is
meaningful,
because
it
becomes
discretionary
with
the
apa
whether
a
subsequent
application
from
the
inmate
will
be
considered
for
clemency.
that
is
under
paragraph
g
of
the
policy,
which
makes
it
forever,
and
then
in
the
administrative
code,
5120
1-1-15
puts
a
2-year
limit
on
it.
at
the
moment
i
cannot
tell
you
which
of
those
the
courts
of
ohio
will
determine
may
or
may
not
be
the
final
time
limit
on
how
long
they
can
withhold
the
clemency
application
from
consideration.
so
i
think
that
the
process
distinction
here,
and
the
reason
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
details,
is
that
this
is
a
process
that
keeps
us
from
getting
there.
those
cases
that
address
that
kind
of
detailed
parsing
of
the
language
are
ones
where
you
always
were
able
to
get
there.
i
also
think
that
in
this
case
we
have
a
situation
where
the
process
itself
has
created
the
kinds
of
parameters
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
creating
a
due
process
interest,
a
statecreated
liberty
interest
that
deserves
due
process
protection.

--you
don't
have
to
come
back...
i'll
answer
the
last
part
first.
you
don't
have
to
come
back
to
there
being
a
right
to
the
clemency
proceeding
in
order
to
reach
the
question
whether
or
not
this
imposes
an
unconstitutional
condition.
ms.
s.
adele
shank
i
think
that
the
best
case
for
us
is
one
that
analyzes
the
rough
proportionality
or
rational
nexus
that
must
exist
between
the
condition
that's
being
imposed
and
the
policy
it's
supposed
to
implement,
and
that
is
dolan
v.
city
of
tigard,
where
this
court
found
that
that
was
essential.
the
purpose,
the
stated
purpose,
the
declared
purpose
by
the
ohio
supreme
court
and
the
ohio
constitutional
debates
for
these
legislative
regulations
on
the
application
process,
and
they
are
legislative,
not
executive,
is
to
ensure
the
quality
of
information
that
reaches
the
government.
when
you
put
the
person
in
the
position
of
either
being
unable
to
participate
because
they
have
to
exert
their
fifth
amendment
rights,
or
being
in
a
coercive
situation,
then
you
have
undermined
the
state's
stated
purpose
for
having
these
regulations.
