mr.
klatt,
are
you
then
saying
that
what...
there
may
be
some
process
due,
but
whatever
process
due
it
has
been
allowed,
or
are
you
taking
the
position
that
due
process,
as
distinguished
from
equal
protection,
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
due
process
doesn't
enter
into
it?
the
examples
that,
was
it
judge
nelson
gave,
were
due
process
examples.
that
is,
arbitrary
decisionmaking.
she
gave
the
example
of
a
coin
toss,
or
picking
the
straw
out.
so
are
you
saying,
suppose
the
parole
board
said,
oh,
we
have
better
things
to
do
with
our
time
than
read
all
this
stuff,
so
we're
going
to
toss
a
coin
and
every
tenth
or,
say,
every
tenth
applicant
will
get
clemency?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
could
be
totally
arbitrary
as
long
as
it's
not
a
denial,
so
you're
saying
there
is
an
equal
protection
check
but
not
a
due
process
check,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
klatt,
i
thought
that
that
was
one
of
the
arguments
that
you
made,
but
in
your
first
exchange
with
justice
o'connor
you
said
yes,
there'd
be
an
equal
protection
check,
so
i
was
thinking
that
your
argument
was
kind
of
like
a,
what's
labeled
political
question.
this
is
committed
to
another
branch
of
government,
totally
executive,
judiciary,
hands
off.
but
your
immediate
response
was
no,
there
is
judicial
review
for
constitutionality
under
the
heading
of
equal
protection,
so
i
gathered
from
that
answer
that
you
weren't
taking
the
answer
that
you
are
now
giving,
that
this
is
just
handsoff
for
the
judiciary,
it
is
entirely
executive
branch
business.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
using
the
political
question
doctrine,
that
model,
it
isn't
that
as
to
one
clause
or
as
to
another
clause,
it's
even...
it's
a
first
amendment
violation,
whatever.
it
simply
is
committed
to
another
branch
of
government.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
shank,
one
of
the
problems
is,
it's
always
going
to
be
facial
because
you
took
this
case
out
of
the
ohio
system...
true,
it's
an
executive
process,
and
you're
taking
it
into
the
federal
court
and
you're
saying
now,
what
if,
what
if.
we
don't
know
what
it
would
be.
are
you
taking
the
position
that
it
is
inevitable
that
this
procedure
that
ohio
has
would
yield
a
violation
of
due
process?
couldn't
one
say,
well,
it
may
work
so
that
he
is
treated
fairly.
how
can
one
say
just
on
what
we
have
here
that
applying
these
rules
to
his
case
would
inevitably
deny
due
process?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
had
been...
nothing
has
happened.
you
took...
you
got
a
stay
and
took
it
all
into
the
federal
court,
so
we
don't
know
how
this
state
process
would
work
because
it
didn't
get
off
the
ground.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
or
will
be.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
ohio
said,
well,
for
capital
cases
we're
going
to
have
a
simple
proceeding.
it's
just
the
governor
and
whatever
trusted
advisor,
so
we
cut
out
all
this
process
that
you're
complaining
is
inadequate.
would
it
be
constitutional
for
ohio
to
have
such
a
system,
just
the
governor,
who
will
consult
with
a
trusted
advisor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
once
you
have
a
process,
once
you
try
to
install
something
like
this,
it
better
be
meticulously
observed.
doesn't
that
give
the
signal
that
it's
not
very
wise
for
a
state
to
have
these
processes,
that
they
ought
to
stick
with
just
a
simple,
you
ask
the
governor,
the
governor
says
no,
that's
it?
