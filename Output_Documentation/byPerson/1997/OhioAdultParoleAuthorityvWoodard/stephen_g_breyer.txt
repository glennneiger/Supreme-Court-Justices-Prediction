justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
problem
that
i'm
having
is,
this
case
is
in
an
interlocutory
posture,
and
so
looking
at
the
opinion,
i
thought
perhaps
the
circuit
has
just
held
that
the
due
process
clause
could,
in
some
conceivable
circumstance,
be
violated,
and
can
we
say
now
that
we
could
never
even
imagine
a
circumstance,
so
matter
how
bizarre
or
peculiar
or
unfair
the
system
was,
that
it
couldn't
possibly
be
a
violation
no
matter
what,
and
the
same,
really,
in
a
sense
is
true
of
the
fifth
amendment
part.
is
it...
do
we
have
to
say
that
there's
never
a
circumstance,
even
if
the
clemency
board
were
to
say,
you
have
to
confess
to
every
crime
ever,
ever
conceivable
by
any
member
of...
you
know,
i
mean
think
of
the
most
bizarre
circumstance
you
can.
and
now,
if
there
is
such
a
circumstance
in
which
either
of
these
clauses
would
apply,
how
can
we
say
that
you
win,
in
this
posture
of
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
take
it
part
of
his
argument
might
be,
though
i'm
not
positive
on
this,
is
that
the
timing
of
this
is
really...
there's
no
reason
in
the
world
under
the...
as
far
as
clemency
is
concerned
that
you
have
to
have
the
timing
deadlines
the
way
you
do,
and
the
way
you
do
means
that
he
has
to
incriminate
himself
completely
at
a
time
prior
to
the
ultimate
affirmation
of
his
convictions,
and
you
could
move
that
easily
so
he
didn't
have
to
do
that,
but
the
way
it
stands,
he
might
have
to
have
a
new
trial,
and
then
he'd
be
convicted
out
of
his
own
mouth
simply
because
of
an
unnecessary
and
arbitrary
timing
circumstance
in
the
rules.
i
think
there's
something
like
that
going
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what's
the
answer
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
analogy
that
i'm...
sorry.
were
you...
answer
justice
ginsburg.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
think
of
any
other
analogies?
i
take
it
your
basic
argument
is
that
the
procedural
part
of
this
is
something
that
the
ohio
legislature
itself
has
said
is
not
within
the
governor's
exclusive
power.
they
say
the
general
assembly's
authority
to
regulate
the
application
process
extends
from
the
time
just
before
the
governor
reaches
the
decision,
and
you're
talking
about
that
time
before,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
i'm
looking
for,
the
only
one
with
a
very
far
analogy
is
like
international
airline
applications,
where
the
courts
won't
review
what
the
president's
final
decision
is,
but
i've
always
thought
they
would
review
what
used
to
be
the
civil
aeronautics
board's
preparation
of
the
recommendation
to
the
president.
that's
a
pretty
farout
analogy,
and
i
wonder
if
there
are
other
instances
you
could
think
of
where
the
congressionally
regulated
preparation
of
the
application
is
certainly
reviewable,
but
the
final
decision
is
not.
you've
looked
into
this,
so
i
assume
your
answer
is
no,
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
have
you...
the
other
question
that
i
has
is,
is
the
particular
problem
here,
which
i
couldn't
quite
figure
out
from
the
dates...
i
can't
keep
them
quite
in
mind,
but
the
particular
problem
is
that
the
state
says,
prepare
this
45
days
before
the
execution
is
scheduled,
but
in
the
case
of
your
client,
he
had
to
go
to
his
hearing
6
months
before,
or
4
months
before,
because
there
was
a
stay
that
said
the
execution
couldn't
take
place
until
january
18,
'95,
but
they
wanted
to
have
the
hearing
on
september
9,
1994,
and
you're
objecting
to
the
fact
that
they
made
him
come
to
that
hearing
without
a
lawyer,
and
having
to
incriminate
himself
so
soon.
could
you
explain
that
a
little
bit,
how
those
work?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
objection,
then,
precisely
is
you
say,
look,
he
can't
have
a
lawyer,
he
has
to
incriminate
himself,
and
all
they
have
to
do
to
avoid
the
problem
and
keep
their
time
is,
you
say,
do
it
45
days
before,
but
if
there's
been
an
extension
of
a
stay,
well,
then
it's
45
days
before
the
real
execution
date,
not
the
one
that
was
just
hypothetical.
is
that
the
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
if
the...
i
don't
know
if
she
wants
this
argument,
but
the
strongest
point,
i
thought,
going
back
to
the
complaint,
would
be
a
mathews
v.
eldridge
point,
that
all
she
wants
is
you
to
postpone
this
hearing
until
it's
45
days
before
the
real
execution,
and
you
won't
do
it.
and
the
state's
interest
in
not
doing
it...
you
know,
not
postponing
it
till
the
45
days
is
real,
is
zero,
her
interest
is...
well,
she
loses
her
right,
the
client
loses
right
to
a
lawyer
and
selfincrimination
in
a
real
practical
way,
very
strong.
the
administrative
ease
is
tremendous.
all
you
have
to
do
is
say
we're
going
to
follow
what
the
court
does,
and
therefore
this
is
a
tremendously
strong
argument
for...
since
it
isn't
even
the
governor,
it's
the
special
board
run
by
the
legislature,
for
denial
of
due
process.
now,
i'm
being
quick
about
that,
but
i...
so
what's
your...
what...
i
got
that
out
of
the
complaint...
what's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--sure
there
is,
but
everybody
else,
everybody
without
a
stay
it's
45
days
before,
it's
before
the
real
execution,
so
what's
your
interest
in
getting
that
information
6
months
before
the
execution,
where
all
that's
happened
is
that
there's
been
a
court
order
delaying
it
for
6
months.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
here
they
ask...
they
pointed
out,
they
enclose,
attached
to
the
complaint,
the
court
order
of
ohio
making
the
execution
date
not
45
days
after
september
9,
but
sometime
after
the
following
january
18,
and
still
the
board,
they
say,
wouldn't
postpone
the
hearing.
they
wanted
to
have
it
on
the
9th.
