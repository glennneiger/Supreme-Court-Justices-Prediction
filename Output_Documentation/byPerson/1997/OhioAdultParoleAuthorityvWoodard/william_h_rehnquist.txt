chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-1769,
the
ohio
adult
parole
authority
v.
woodard.
mr.
klatt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
here,
as
i
understand
it,
based
its
ruling
on
the
due
process
clause,
not
the
equal
protection
clause,
is
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
certainly
what
dumschat
held,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
certainly
consistent
with
the
reasoning
in
evitts,
is
it
not,
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
can't
block
an
appeal
from
an
indigent
if
the
state
provides
one,
but
the
state
under
durston
v.
king
doesn't
have
to
provide
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
supposing
the
governor
has
complete
control
over
the
use
of
the
ohio
state
stadium
for
the
ohio
statemichigan
game,
and
he
decides
that
only
white
people
will
be
admitted
for
that
game.
now,
nobody
has
any
sort
of
a
protected
liberty
interest
or
property
interest
to
go
to
that
game
at
all,
but
nonetheless
the
equal
protection
clause
would
apply
to
prevent
that
sort
of
discrimination,
would
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
your
argument
as
i
understood
it
was
that
once
there
has
been
a
final
adjudication
through
the
appellate
process
which
has
resulted
in
a
judgment
that
this
individual
should
lose
his
life,
that
there
is
no
life
interest
left
for
the
due
proces
clause
to
protect.
isn't
that
your
argument,
and
that's
why
you
take
the
absolutist
position
on
due
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
if
we
say,
for
example,
well,
clemency
really
is
part
of
the
adjudicatory
process,
or
if
we
were
to
say,
well,
if
you
grant
a
clemency
proceeding
you've
got
to
have
some
minimal
process
for
it,
you
would
lose,
but
at
least
you
would
lose
because
we
were
rejecting
that
absolutist
analysis
as
being
sufficient,
but
that's
still
consistent,
i
think,
with
your
position
on
equal
protection.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
klatt.
ms.
shank,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
we
deal,
ms.
shank,
don't
we,
with
the
facts
that
were
alleged
with
respect
to
the
ohio
parole,
ohio
clemency
process.
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
we
could
conjure
up
some
hypothetical
set
of
facts
that
weren't
the
standard
ohio
clemency
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the...
i
got
the
intimation,
perhaps
mistakenly,
from
your
statement
that
if
we
could
conceive
of
some
clemency
process
somewhere
that
had
some
sort
of
provisions
in
it
that
would
be
so
arbitrary
we
would
say
due
process
applies,
we
should
bring
that
to
bear
on
this
case,
but
we're
dealing
with
an
established
system
of
clemency
in
ohio,
are
we
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
also
we
have
to
take
it
in
the
prism
of
the
sixth
circuit's
analysis.
i
mean,
if
we
disagree
with
the
sixth
circuit's
analysis,
the
fact
that
the
pleadings
might
have
formed
the
basis
for
some
other
sort
of
analysis
wouldn't
have
much
to
do
with
how
we
treated
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
we
granted
review
on
was
not
the
pleadings
that
were
filed
in
the
district
court.
it
was
the
opinion
of
the
sixth
circuit,
and
if,
for
example,
we
should
feel
that
the
sixth
circuit
totally
misapprehended
our
dumschat
opinion
we
would
probably
say
so
in
an
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
said
none
at
all.
didn't
the
dumschat
opinion
say
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
let
me
read
you
a
couple
of
sentences
from
dumschat
which
strike
me
as
being
a
little
different
than
the
way
you
interpret...
the
court
said
we
rejected
the
claim
that
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
release
from
a
valid
prison
sentence
exists
independently
of
a
right
explicitly
conferred
by
the
state,
and
then
it
goes
on
to
quote
from
greenholtz.
there
is
no
constitutional
or
inherent
right
of
a
convicted
person
to
be
conditionally
released
before
the
expiration
of
a
valid
sentence.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
says
that
unless
the
state
has
created
some
sort
of
a
liberty
interest
there
isn't
any.
justice
stevens
in
dissent,
of
course,
felt
differently.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
you
on
that
point
though,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
it,
or
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
presumably
the
court
of
appeals
well
knew
that
you...
dealing
with
a
complaint
dismissed
on
motion
you
give
it
a
generous
construction.
you
say
that's
what
we
should
do,
and
certainly
i'm
sure
the
court
of
appeals
knew
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
didn't
argue
that
point
to
the
court
of
appeals?
did--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
asked
you
a
question,
ms.
shank.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
asked
you,
did
you
argue
those
cases
that
you
just
cited
to
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
we
held
in
the
assisted
suicide
case
was
that
there
was
no
constitutional
right
to
have
the
assistance
of
a
physician
if
you
wanted
to
commit
suicide,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
shank,
is
there
any
rule
in
ohio
that
you
know
of
that
would
prevent
your
client
in
his
interview
with
the
clemency
people
from
declining
to
answer
a
question
because
it
might
incriminate
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
so
far
as
you
know
there
are
no
further
sanctions...
in
fact,
it's
difficult
to
see
what
further
sanction
could
be
attached
to
someone
who
is
condemned
to
death...
would
be
attached
if
the...
if
your
client
simply
said,
i'm
not
going
to
answer
that
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wouldn't
incriminate
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
happens
in
civil
proceedings
all
the
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
by
the
time
you
get
to
clemency
beggars
can't
be
choosers.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
shank.
mr.
klatt,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
for
mathews
v.
eldridge
to
apply
there
has
to
be
some
protected
interest
under
the
due
process
clause
in
the
first
place.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klatt.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
the
case
is
submitted.
