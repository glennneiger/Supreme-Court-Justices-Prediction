mr.
william
a.
klatt
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
presents
a
challenge
to
ohio's
death
penalty
clemency
procedures
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
selfincrimination
clause
of
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
address
the
due
process
challenge
first.
fundamentally,
respondent's
due
process
challenge
fails
for
two
reasons.
first,
he
has
no
constitutional
or
inherent
right
to
clemency
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
connecticut
board
of
pardons
v.
dumschat.
second,
ohio's
adoption
of
the
clemency
power
and
the
procedures
associated
with
it
do
not
create
a
constitutional
entitlement
because
the
governor's
exercise
of
that
power
remains
wholly
discretionary.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i
believe
there
would
be
a
limit
under
that--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--there
would
be
an
equal--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--yes.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
yes,
your
honor,
we
do
concede
that,
not
rational
basis
equal
protection,
but
certainly
a
suspect
category,
perhaps
even
a
substantive
due
process
problem
in
an
outrageous
circumstance.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
it
would
make
a
difference
in
terms
of
equal
protection,
rational
basis
and
due
process.
i
think
the
analysis
would
be
essentially
the
same,
although
for
slightly
different
reasons.
fundamentally,
the
due
process
clause
is
not
violated
in
this
instance
because
there
is
no
underlying
life,
liberty,
or
property
interest
that's
at
stake.
that
interest
has
been
adequately
safeguarded
by
the
substantial
protections
that
exist
at
the
trial
court
level
and
certainly
throughout
the
appeal
process
leading
to
the
final
conviction.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
fundamentally,
because
there
is
no
underlying
life,
liberty,
or
property
interest,
that
a
governor
could
make
a
clemency
decision
in
an
arbitrary
manner.
it's
almost
inherent
in
the
concept
of
unfettered
discretion.
i
don't
think
that
would
happen.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
a
governor
would
act
any
less
responsibly
than
a
court
would
in
exercising
power,
and
in
fact
clemency
by
constitutional
design
was
meant
to
be
an
unfettered
power
of
the
executive
branch
as
a
check
on
the
judicial
branch,
so
fundamentally
our
position--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--yes.
yes.
that's
exactly
our
position.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
it
does
not
implicate
it
on
these
facts
for
the
simple
reason
that
ohio,
in
enacting
the
power,
did
not
in
any
way
create
standards
or
criteria
that
limit
the
discretion
of
the
decisionmaker.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
that's
exactly
what
dumschat
held,
your
honor,
and
it's
a
case
that
we
rely
very
heavily
on.
we
believe
it's
a
case
that
is
right
on
point
in
terms
of
the
facts
that
are
confronted
with...
that
are
confronted
the
court
in
our
case.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
they,
of
course,
make
a
number
of
arguments,
your
honor,
but
that
is
one
of
them,
and
i
believe
the
argument
is
flawed
for
the
simple
reason
that
the
court
in
dumschat,
relying
i
think
principally
on
the
greenholtz
analysis,
basically
said
that
if
the
interest
that
was
at
issue...
and
in
that
case
i
admit
it
was
a
liberty
interest,
not
a
life
interest,
but
i
don't
think
that
matters,
because
what
the
court
was
saying
is,
if
the
interest
that
was
at
issue
was
contemplated
and
encompassed
in
the
underlying
conviction
and
sentence,
that
that
interest
has
been
adequately
safeguarded,
and--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--well,
i
think
that
would...
it
sounds
as
if
you're
asking
a
straight
right
to
counsel
question.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
it
would
be
i
think
just
under
the
sixth
amendment,
which
of
course
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
believe
there
is
no
right
to
counsel
constitutionally
to...
in
the
clemency
process,
so
the
state
would
not
have
to
provide
a
counsel.
now,
of
course,
ohio
does
provide
counsel
in
that
process.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i
don't
believe
that
would
violate
due
process,
because
there
is
no
underlying--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--it
potentially
could
violate
the
sixth
amendment.
it
potentially
could.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
it
certainly
is
a
life
interest
here.
in
that
hypothetical,
denying
counsel
at
all
in
the
process
certainly
does
not
seem
correct,
but
if
there's
no
underlying
life,
liberty,
or
property
interest
i
don't
know
how
it
would
implicate
a
due
process
interest.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i
don't
believe
that
does
follow,
your
honor.
clemency
and
that
power
is
very
distinct
from
the
processes
that
involve
the
judicial
processes.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
if
i
implied
that,
i
misspoke.
it's
our
position
that
evitts,
which,
of
course,
is
a
case
that
is
heavily
relied
upon
by
my
opponent
and
relied
upon
by
the
sixth
circuit
below,
is
also
correctly
decided
in
the
sense
that
due
process
certainly
applies
throughout
the
adjudicatory
process,
which
would
include
the
appeal
process.
how
much--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--because
the
other
processes
are
part
of
the
system
for
adjudicating
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
clemency
is
not--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--correct.
correct.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
yes.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
yes.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i
believe--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--i
would
agree,
your
honor.
i
might
add
that
the
fundamental
flaw,
i
believe,
in
the
application
of
evitts
to
this
case,
is
that
the
lower
court's
decision
was
based
upon
a
faulty
premise,
and
that
premise
is,
that
faulty
premise
is
that
clemency
is
part
of
ohio's
system
for
the
adjudication
of
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
well,
i
would
contend,
your
honor,
that
simply
acknowledging
the
existence
of
a
power
of
another
branch
of
government
does
not,
in
and
of
itself,
make
it
part
of
the
process,
and
in
fact,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
structure,
clemency
is
one
of
the
checks
and
balances
that
we
believe
exists,
certainly
under
ohio's
constitution,
that
is
an
executive
branch's
check
on
the
judicial
system.
and
of
course,
the
check
on
the
clemency
power
itself
is
basically
the
electoral
process.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
well,
i
certainly
would
hope
that
you
wouldn't,
but
i
believe
that
ohio's
death
penalty
clemency
procedure
in
this
case
would
survive
such
scrutiny.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i'd
be
certainly
happy
to.
keep
in
mind
here
that
this
policy
was
enacted
to
address
a
problem,
and
the
problem
was
that
the
governor
was
confronted
with
clemency
applications
with
very
little
information,
oftentimes
because
counsel
for
the
death
row
inmates
would
not
seek
stays
until
the
very
last
minute.
in
fact,
they
had
a
situation
where
counsel
for
a
death
row
inmate
filed
for
the
stay
the
day
before
the
execution
date
with
the
district
court
judge.
that
judge
denied
the
stay.
the
stay
was
subsequently
granted
later
that
day
in
the
sixth
circuit,
but
the
governor
was
quite
upset
that
with
practically
no
information
he
was
confronted
with
a
clemency
situation,
so
they
enact
these
procedures.
the
procedures
are
designed
to
be
fair--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--of
the
execution--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--no.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i'm
sorry--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--it
was
a
stay
obtained
in
the
sixth
circuit,
a
stay
of
execution
so
that
he
could
pursue
federal
habeas.
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
well,
it's
our
position,
your
honor,
and
we
are
taking
an
absolute
position,
that
with
respect
to
due
process
there
is
no
due
process
protections
that
apply
here
for
the
simple
reason,
as
i
stated
earlier,
that
there
is
no
underlying
life,
liberty,
or
property
interest
to--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--some
power,
some
delegation
of
power
is
absolute.
the
veto
power.
state--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--i
may
have
misspoke.
my
point
was
that
with
respect
to
a
due
process
analysis
our
position
is
absolute,
because
you
could--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--we're
not
going
quite
that
far,
because
we
have
acknowledged
that
there
might
be
some
outrageous
circumstance
where
there
could
be--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--no.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i'd
be
happy
to
respond--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--it's
the
position
of
the
state
of
ohio
that
since
the
clemency
power
comes
from
the
constitution,
at
least
the
ohio
constitution,
in
ohio,
that
it
can't
violate
another
expressed
provision
of
the
constitution,
and
the
only
one
i
can
think
of
would
be
a
racebased
decision.
that
seems
inherently
wrong--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--well,
even
in
dumschat
the
court
seemed
to
indicate
that
you
could
deny
clemency
for
any
reason
or
no
reason
at
all
for
any
constitutionally
permissible
reason.
if
it's
not
a
constitutionally
permissible
reason
it
might
create
a
problem.
now,
keep
in
mind,
equal
protection
is
not
an
issue
that's
currently
before
you,
but
if
i
understand,
it's...
it's
a
diff...
hypothetical.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i
believe
it
would,
and
that's
i
think
our
essential
point,
and
i
don't
think
quite
frankly
from
a
practical
standpoint
it's
that
much
of
a
concession.
what
is
really
a
problem
here
is
applying
a
due
process
analysis
which
would...
at
any
level,
which
seems
to
totally
open
up
the
door.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
well,
certainly,
race
is
not
the
only
basis,
but
the--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--that
would
be
intermediate
scrutiny,
which
would
be
higher.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
that,
i
think,
is
a
very
close
question.
i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--that's
exactly
it,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
yes.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
correct,
and
i
didn't--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--i
believe
we
would
win
even
if
there
were
some
level
of
due
process
protection.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
and
the
reason
is,
is
because
here
we
had
notice,
and
opportunity
for
an
interview.
counsel
could
participate
in
terms
of
helping
with
the
preparation
of
written
materials
that
the
applicant
could
submit
if
they
wanted
to,
so
you
certainly
had
notice,
opportunity
for
participation,
an
informal
review
process...
the
whole
procedure
was
designed
to
be
fair
both
to
the
inmate
as
well
as
to
the
public,
as
well
as
to
the
courts,
and
as
well
as
to
the
prosecutor,
so
i
believe
the
procedure
is
a
fair
one
under
any
analysis.
it
is
not,
however,
an
adjudicatory
process,
and
it
is
not
an
adversarial
process,
which
is
the
very
reason
why
counsel
were
not
permitted
at
the
interview,
and
counsel
would
not
be
permitted
at
the
review
itself,
and
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
in
any
way
problematic,
because
there's
no
due
process
requirement
under
our
argument
that
that
applies,
and
it's--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--i
believe
that's
their
argument.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
i
think
the
answer
is
that
there
is
a
legitimate...
it's
not
an
unreasonable
and
arbitrary
matter
of
timing.
there's
a
very
good
reason
for
it,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
governor
needs
to
be
sure
that
he
has
the
information
necessary
so
that
he
can
responsibly
exercise
the
discretion
that
he
has.
we're
talking
about
a
very
short
time
frame
here.
the
rule
says
that
if
you're
within
45
days
of
an
execution
date
and
it
hasn't
been
stayed,
that's
when
the
interview
process
and
the
formal
review
process
goes
forward,
so
there
is
a
legitimate
state
interest--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--there
was,
and
the
timing
problem
in
this
case
was
created
essentially
by
the
respondent
themselves
for
not
getting
the
stay
in
a
timely
way.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
the
further--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--that's
obviously
not
our
case,
but
i
suppose
that
there
is
a
line
some
place
where
timing
seems
to
give
rise
to
compulsion,
and
that
might
be
a
problem.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
exists
in
the
hypothetical
that
you
proposed,
but
it
might,
but
certainly,
given
where
the
process
was
in
this
case,
that
does
not
seem
to
be
problematic.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
yes.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
absolutely
not.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
yes.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
thank
you.
one
thing
i'd
like
to
make
very
clear
is
that
there
is
nothing
in
ohio's
death
penalty
clemency
procedures
that
compel
the
respondent
to
incriminate
himself.
the
interview
places
no
condition
requiring
the
waiver
of
any
constitutional
right,
and
has
no
element
of
compulsion.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
you
might
have
compulsion
under
those
circumstances.
that's
not
the
situation
here.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
well,
i
would
respectfully
disagree,
that
there
is
a
very
important,
legitimate
state
interest
in
the
timing
of
obtaining
the
information.
even
if
a
stay
would
be
obtained,
the
order--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--well,
if
i
understand
your
question,
i
don't
know
that
the
state
would
have
an
interest
at
that
point--
mr.
william
a.
klatt
--that's
correct.
the
simple
fact
that
there
is
a
time
limit...
in
this
instance
it
was
45
days,
which
seems
to
be
a
reasonable
period
of
time...
who
knows
when
the
stay
might
ultimately
be
obtained.
it
might
never
be
obtained.
mr.
william
a.
klatt
absolutely,
and
fundamentally--
