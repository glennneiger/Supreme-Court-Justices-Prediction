justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see...
what
difference
would
that
make,
what
clause
you're
proceeding
under?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
there's
anything
that
seems
harsh
about
that,
i
suppose
it
is
the
deprivation
of
the
appeal,
not
the
deprivation
of
additional
procedures
in
the
pardon.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
outrageous?
i
mean,
once
you
say
equal
protection,
it
seems
to
me
you
give...
suppose
the
governor
has
two
applicants
for
pardon,
they
are
identical
in
all
their
circumstances,
and
the
governor
says,
i
grant
one
and
i
don't
grant
the
other.
is
that...
you
think
we
can
intervene
in
that
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
we
can't
intervene
in
that
case,
i
suppose
we
can
look
to
see
if
they
are
identical
circumstances,
so
the
ball
game's
over.
you've
gotten
the
whole
matter
into
the
court.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
give
away
the
equal
protection
clause
and
achieve
what
you're
seeking
to
achieve
here.
well...
go
ahead.
answer
justice
scalia.
if
you
consider
it
a
question,
answer
it.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
if
you
give
away
the
equal
protection
clause--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
because
that
is
currently
a
very
enraging
thing,
but
why
is
that
any
more
enraging
than
two
identically
qualified
people,
and
the
governor
says,
i
like
this
guy,
you
get
it,
you
don't
get
it?
why
is
that
any
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
easy
enough
if
you
limit
it
to
race
alone,
but
once
you
say
you're
entitled
to
equal
treatment,
why
isn't
he
entitled
to
come
to
the
court
and
say,
look,
just
last
year
somebody
was
pardoned
who
has,
you
know,
exactly
the
same
qual...
or
no
better
qualifications?
why
doesn't...
isn't
that
a
denial
of...
is
race
the
only
basis
for
denial
of
equal
protection?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume
that
this
answer
is
on
the
assumption
that
the
due
process
clause
applies.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
not
your
position
in
this
litigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
say
in
this
litigation
it
doesn't
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
thought
the
remand
was
limited
to
whether
the
district
court
could
find
that
the
coercion
to
confess
guilt
was
an
unconstitutional
condition.
justice
antonin
scalia
wasn't
that
what
the
remand
was
limited
to,
or
was
it
remanded
for
the
district
court
to
come
up
with
any
other
due
process
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is...
i
don't
understand
this.
this
is
sort
of
a
right
to
the
process
with
nothing
at
the
end
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
a
right
to
the
process...
i
can
understand,
and
i
think
dumschat
permits
your
claiming
a
right
to
the
procedure
which
the
state
has
accorded,
so
that
if
they
violate
their
own
procedures
for
clemency,
yes,
you
would
have
some
right
to
complain.
but
where
their
procedures
give
you
no
more
than
what
you've
received,
you're
asserting
that
you've
been
deprived
of
what?
you
say,
i'm
not
being
deprived
of
my
liberty,
but
i'm
just
being
deprived
of
something
in
the
abstract
that...
i
don't...
i
really
don't
understand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right,
but...
let
me
just
clarify.
you're
not
contending
that
ohio
violated
any
of
its
own
laws
pertaining
to
the
clemency
application.
you're
saying
that
something
which
they
have
in
there
shouldn't
be
there,
or
that
something
which
they
don't
have
should.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
shank,
it's
not
only
capital
defendants
who
apply
for
clemency,
and
it's
quite
possible
to
talk
about
the
end
of
the
process
when
you're
dealing
with
a
capital
defendant
who's
lost,
but
what
about
other
defendants?
what's
the
end
of
the
process?
as
long
as
they're
in
prison
they
can
continue
to
find
new
reasons
why
the
case
should
be
reopened,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
what
is
the
end
of
the
process
for
someone
who
hasn't...
you
know,
who
hasn't
been
condemned
to
death?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
in
any
of
the
other
cases,
whenever
the
hearing
is
held,
wouldn't
the
prisoner
have
the
same
objection?
you
know,
i'm
going
to
be
spending
years
in
prison
trying
to
figure
out
what
went
wrong
in
my
trial,
and
i'm
going
to
file
collateral
review
applications,
and
by
making
me
come
in
and
confess,
you're
making
it
impossible
for
me
to
do
that.
wouldn't
every
prisoner
have
that
claim?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
my...
the
point
i'm
making
is,
we
can't
solve
the
problem,
as
justice
breyer
suggests,
by
simply
making
sure
that
the
proceeding
here
is
held
after
the
last
habeas
before
the
execution.
the
problem's
going
to
exist
in
noncapital
cases
perpetually.
