justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
something,
mr.
klatt.
suppose
that
the
governor...
obviously
an
unlikely
scenario,
but
suppose
the
governor
of
ohio,
some
future
governor,
decided
that
he
would
grant
clemency
to...
he
would
at
least
allow
clemency
hearings
and
consider
clemency
for
white
defendants
but
not
black.
no
limit
there
on
a
policy
like
that,
would
you
say,
under
the
constitution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
what
we
have
to
decide--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--is,
what
are
the
limits,
and
how
do
we
draw
that
line.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
do
concede
that
there
would
be
some
equal
protection
concerns,
certainly,
constitutionally
imposed?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
klatt,
in
dumschat
this
court's
opinion
said
that
unlike
probation
pardon
and
commutation
decisions
have
not
traditionally
been
the
business
of
the
courts
and,
as
such,
they're
rarely
subjects
for
judicial
review.
if
we
were
to
take
the
position
that
it
is
conceivable
that
wholly
arbitrary
action
in
the
clemency
procedure
could
be
addressed
under
the
due
process
clause,
how
would
you
address
the
allegations
that
are
made
here?
would
they
survive
that
rare
situation,
or
how
would
you
address
those
challenges
in
this
case,
if
there...
if
we
left
open
the
possibility
that
there
could
conceivably
be
a
due
process
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
going
to
address
the
allegations
with
any
particularity
or
specificity
in
giving
me
that
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
if
it's
a
racebased
discrimination
we
apply
heightened
scrutiny
to
it,
and
if
it's
not,
you
have
a
totally
different
standard,
wouldn't
you
say?
--then
you
agree
the
governor
could
have
a
policy
of
pardoning
all
women
and
no
men,
or
could
he
not?
that
also
invokes
heightened
scrutiny
of
some
sort,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
klatt,
you
never
have
answered
my
question.
would
you
lose
if
we
said
there
might
be
some
extreme
situation
governed
by
the
due
process
clause?
you've
never
addressed
what
the
allegations
are
here.
one
is
based
on
the
fifth
amendment,
i
believe,
and
one
is
based
on
the
timing
of
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--clemency
hearing.
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
merits
of
the
claims
at
all,
or
are
we
to
end
this
argument
without
ever
hearing
whether
you
would
lose
in
the
event
we
don't
adopt
the
absolutist
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
assume
we
at
least
have
to
look
at
the
facts
alleged
in
this
complaint,
not
some
conceivable
set
of
facts
from
somebody
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
we
look
at
this
complaint?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
complaint
says--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
under
ohio's
provisions
here,
which
gives
the
convicted
defendant
an
opportunity
to
ask
for
an
interview
but
doesn't
require
it,
you
say
that's
a
fifth
amendment
violation
there,
and
it
won't
stand
up.
i
assume
we
can
address
that,
can't
we,
just
head
on.
