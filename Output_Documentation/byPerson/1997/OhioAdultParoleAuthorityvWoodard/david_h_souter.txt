--then
it
does
matter
on
your
analysis
that,
although
the
state...
although
there
is
no...
in
your
judgment,
although
there
is
no
life
interest
to
be
protected,
and
although
the
state
is
not
obligated
to
give
any
clemency
consideration
at
all,
it
still
does
not
matter
on
your
analysis
that
the
state
has
chosen
to
do
it,
that
that
does
not
implicate
a
due
process
concern.
justice
david
h.
souter
does
it
follow
from
your
argument
that
there
is
no
due
process
implication
to
the
provision
of
direct
appeals
in
criminal
cases,
no
due
process
implication
in
providing
the
cert
process
that
we
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
will
grant...
i'll
grant
you
that,
but
what
i
was
picking
up
on
was
the
statement
you
made
ago
in
one
of
your
answers,
i
guess,
to
justice
kennedy,
that
the
interest
being
protected
had
been
protected
in
the
underlying
proceeding.
and
i
thought
your
point
was
that
when
in
the
underlying
criminal
proceeding,
for
example,
leading
to
conviction,
these
interests
had
been
protected,
and
there
was
simply
a
constitutionally
unnecessary
further
proceeding,
whether
it
be
appeal,
or
cert,
or
clemency
in
this
case,
that
there
was
no
application
of
due
process
to
those
superadded
stages.
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
on
your
theory
why
shouldn't
the
due
process
stop
at
the
conviction?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
adjudication's
not
final,
in
other
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
the
state
might
argue
this
way
in
response
to
your
argument
about
the
life
interest.
i
think
the
state
might
say,
we
agree
that
there
is
a
life
interest
up
to
the
time
which
may
lawfully
be
set
for
execution
under
ohio
law,
but
that's
not
what's
in
question
here.
what's
in
question
here
is
an
opportunity
to
have
life
after
the
date
which
the
law
has
already
said
at
which
it
may
be
taken
away,
and
because
you
have
no
life
interest
after
that
point...
you
litigated
that
on
direct
appeal
and
you
lost...
because
you
have
no
life
interest
after
that
point,
and
because
that
is
the
only
life
interest
that
could
be
served
by
clemency,
there
is
no
interest
for
fourteenth...
for
due
process
analysis,
to
which
process
could
apply
and
help
you.
what's
your
answer
to
that
argument?
