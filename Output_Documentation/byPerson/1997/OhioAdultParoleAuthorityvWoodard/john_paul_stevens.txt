justice
john
paul
stevens
then
under
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
a
state
could
totally
abolish
appeal
and
say
after
the
trial
court
proceedings
are
over
whether
or
not
the
man
will
be
sentenced
or
executed
should
be
left
entirely
to
the
unbridled
discretion
of
the
governor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
could
review
his
pardoning
power
on
such
a
challenge,
you
would
agree.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
want
to
have
it
both
ways
on
almost
every
hypothetical.
[laughter]
no,
but
mr.
klatt,
isn't
your
argument
here
that
the
equal
protection
clause
does
not
apply
contingent
upon
the
kind
of
protected
interest
analysis
which
is
identical
to
the
due
process
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
go
back
to
dumschat
for
a
second,
because
i
didn't
think
you
distinguished
it
in
the
same
way
that
the
court
of
appeals
did.
it
seems
to
me
one
can
reasonably
say
that
the
right
to
due
process
before
liberty
is
taken
away
is
exhausted
once
you're
in
jail,
because
your
liberty's
gone.
but
you're
relying
on
the
right
to
due
process
before
life
is
taken
away,
and
this
man
is
still
alive,
so
you
have
an
argument
for
a
protected
interest
in
procedures
until
his
life
is
taken
away
that
just
wasn't
available
in
dumschat
because
he
was
in
jail.
