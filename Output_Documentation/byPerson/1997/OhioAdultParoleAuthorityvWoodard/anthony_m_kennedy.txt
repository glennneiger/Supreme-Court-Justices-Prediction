justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
answer
that
the
respondents
give
is
that
they
say
because
this
is
a
death
penalty
it
is
necessarily
a
part
of
the
criminal
process,
and
dumschat
was
not.
is
that
how
you
understand
their
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
suppose...
and
i
suppose
it's
not
too
unimaginable
a
hypothetical...
that
the
clemency
authorities
said
that
you
may
not
consult
counsel
in
preparation
for
your
clemency
hearing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
that
would
probably
be
under
just
the
sixth
amendment,
wouldn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
my
hypothetical
he
has
a
counsel
but
he's
forbidden
to
consult
the
counsel
in
preparing
his
written
submission
to
the
clemency
board.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
it
violate
any
provision
of
the
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
now
the
sixth
amendment
is
applicable
to
the
states
via
the
fourteenth,
and
then
you're
right
back
into
the
question
of
having
to
have
a
life,
liberty
or
property
interest.
i
would
assume
it
would
be
life
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we
have
said
in
cases
such
as
the
herrera
case,
in
talking
about
the
finality
of
habeas
corpus,
that
there
is
always
clemency.
we
have
made
the
link,
to
some
extent,
in
our
own
writing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
didn't
quite...
was
the
stay
application,
a
request
for
a
stay--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--of
the
execution
by
the
governor,
so
that
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--clemency
process
could
take
place,
or
it
was
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--a
collateral...
additional
collateral
attack
on
the
conviction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
we
could
put
the
same
kind
of
questions
if
you
were
arguing
about
the
executive
power
to
appoint
or
to...
in
the
federal
context
to
recognize
a
foreign
nation.
we
don't
like
arbitrary
government,
but
certain
powers
are
committed
to
the
executive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
this
case
there
was
a
delay
in
filing
the
habeas
petition,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
suppose,
just
to
test
the
theory
and
to
take
justice
breyer's
question
a
little
bit
further,
a
state
had
a
parallel
track.
the
minute
the
trial
court
proceedings
were
concluded
the
clemency
proceedings
started,
and
the
governor
said,
it's
very
important
that
you
admit
guilt,
failure
to
admit
guilt
will
be
an
inference
against
you,
and
this
was
a
parallel
process
with
the
direct
review.
any
problems
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
that's
not
your
case,
but
we're
just--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
we
also
would,
and
i
think
must
examine
the
sixth
circuit's
holding
that
the
selfincrimination
aspect
of
the
case
presents
a
serious
constitutional
problem
in
that
it's
an
unconstitutional
condition
on
the
imposition
of
the...
on
the
fifth
amendment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
that's
the
best
way
for
us
to
get
into
the
case
and
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
a
quite
problematic
holding
on
the
part
of
the
court
of
appeals.
suppose
the
governor
says,
i'm
not
interested
in
granting
clemency
to
people
that
haven't
confessed,
that
shows
remorse.
that's
what
i'm
interested
in.
there's
no
problem
with
that,
is
there?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
may
disagree
with
it
as
a
policy
matter,
but
as
a
constitutional
matter
he
has
a
complete
right
to
say
that,
i
should
assume.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
we
have...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
most
forceful
of
your
arguments
is
the
unconstitutional
condition
argument
on
the
selfincrimination
privilege
that
he
has
in
the
criminal
proceedings,
and
there
we
focus
on
the
criminal
side
and
say,
he's
losing
something
on
the
criminal
side
because
you're
coercing
or
compelling
the
abandonment
of
the
privilege.
what's
your
best
case
on
that?
baxter
doesn't
work
for
you,
really.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
as
sort
of
a
followup
to
that,
do
we
ultimately
come
back
to
the
question
whether
or
not
there
is
a
right
to
the
clemency
proceeding,
so
that
we're
back
to
the
initial
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what's
the
best
case
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
it
was
very
clear
that
silence
would
be
not
only
an
adverse
inference
but
would
likely
result
in
denial
of
clemency.
