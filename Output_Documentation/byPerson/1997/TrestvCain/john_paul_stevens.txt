if
it's
late.
but
ms.
hudsmith,
if
i
understood
your
argument
properly,
weren't
you
saying
that
really
mississippi
has
no
interest
because
there's
nothing
in
this
proceeding
that's
going
to
set
aside
the
mississippi
judgment?
the
only
question
is
whether
the
louisiana
court,
in
imposing
a
sentence,
may
rely
on
those
judgments
even
if
they're
entirely
valid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
interest
would
only
arise
if
he
were
subsequently
prosecuted
in
mississippi.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
another
question
about
the
fifth
circuit's
procedure?
they
say
in
their
own
opinion
they
are
amazed
that
neither
party
had
cited
this
sones
case.
is
it
the
practice
in
that
court,
or
do
you
happen
to
know,
if,
when
they
want
to
rely
on
a
brandnew
ground
that
nobody's
addressed,
do
they
ever
give
notice
to
the
parties
and
ask
them
for
a
brief
comment
on
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
that's
true,
but
they
do
start
out
saying
that
the
sones
decision
precludes
us
from
reviewing
the
merits,
and
they
end
up
saying
this
court
is
bound
to
conclude,
as
we
did
in
sones.
they
thought
they
were
compelled
to
do
what
they'd
done
in
sones.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
surely
thought
it
was
on
point.
they
said
so.
