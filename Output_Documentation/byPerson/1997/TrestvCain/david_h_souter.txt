david
h.
souter
but
that's
a
matter...
i'm
sorry.
that's
a
matter
on
which
you've
never
been
heard,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
right
here,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
claim
that
mississippi
would
be
estopped
in
that
case,
that
there
would
be
any
preclusion
running
against
mississippi
in
that
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
petersen,
i...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
the
other
side
in
this
case
said
that
in
an
objection
to
the
magistrate's
report
they
did
make
this
claim
more
explicit,
that's
the
point
at
which
it
blossomed,
that
the
district
court
made
no
response
to
that
objection
to
the
magistrate's
report
either
by
committing
it
to
the
magistrate
again
for
further
proceedings
or
by
ruling
on
the
merits
and,
that,
in
fact,
the
first
time
it...
and
that
the
state
once
again
said
nothing
about
it
in
the
circuit
itself,
and
that
the
first
time
it
came
up
on
the
merits
was
when
the
circuit
brought
it
up.
is
my
recollection
of
what
they
said
correct
and,
if
so,
are
they
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
aren't
you
assuming
more
than
that?
aren't
you
assuming
not
merely
that
there
was
no
abuse,
but
that
there
was
no
discretion
to
be
exercised,
because
he
could
only...
the
court
could
only
come
out
one
way.
that
would...
isn't
that
the
premise
upon
which
we
would
have
to
affirm
for
you,
because
we're
not
sitting
here
to
exercise
discretion.
that's
not
what
we
do.
that's
what
other
courts
do.
so
if
we
affirm,
it's
got
to
be
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
really
no
discretionary
choice
except
the
choice
that
ultimately
is
reflected
in
this
judgment,
and
that
would
be
the
only
basis
upon
which
we
could
affirm
for
you.
isn't
that
the
premise
of
your
argument?
