justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hudsmith,
you're
not
asserting
here
that
the
court
could
not
have
raised
it
on
its
own.
you're
just
asserting
that
it
had
no
obligation
to.
is
that
the
limit
of
your
argument
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
you're
asking
for
us,
from
us
is
a
remand--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
let
the
court
of
appeals
decide
whether
it
wants
to
exercise
its
discretion
to
raise
this
issue
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hudsmith--
justice
antonin
scalia
--did
the
state
in
its
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
did
the
state
contest
whether
the
opinion
below,
whether
the
court
below
felt
obligated?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
they
didn't
address
the
issue,
and
if
the
question
presented
clearly
only
asks
whether
the
court
of
appeals
is
required
to
raise
the
defense
sua
sponte,
how
do
we
get
into
this
other
point?
i
thought
the
case
was
taken
on
the
assumption
that
the
court
below
was...
felt
itself
obliged
to
raise
the
defense
sua
sponte.
isn't
that
what
the
question
presented
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
state
did
not
object
that
the
question
presented
does
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--conform
to
the
true
state
of
facts?
justice
antonin
scalia
too
late
now.
i
asked
whether
they
did
it
in
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
like
getting
a
case
here
and
then
finding
that
it
involves
a
totally
different
issue
from
the
one
that
we
granted,
and
that's
what
you're
essentially
saying
it
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
issue
you
framed
in
your
question
presented--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
we
granted
as
you
framed
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
i
mean,
you
understand
our--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
would
not
have
voted
to
take
this
case
if
i
thought
what
it
was
going
to
come
down
to
is
a
parsing
of
the
opinion
of
this
court
of
appeals
to
decide
the
cosmic
question
of
whether
this
one
opinion
by
this
court
of
appeals
in
fact
displays
a
belief
that
the
court
is
obliged
to
sua
sponte
raise
the
issue,
or
does
not...
i
mean,
this
is
not
something
that
we
should
be
spending
our
time
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
a
state
has
a
certain
interest...
whether
or
not
he's
prosecuted
later
in
mississippi,
i
think
a
state
has
a
certain
interest
in
not
having
the
solemn
judgments
of
its
courts
impugned
elsewhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
at
least
where
the
constitution
does
not
permit
that
to
happen.
don't
you
think
they
have
a...
if
they
assert
that
that's
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
mississippi
feels
otherwise,
and
wants
to
have
its
judgments
final
and
not
looked
into
later--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
i
thought
you
had
to
give
judgments
the
effect
they
had
in
the
state
where
they
were
rendered.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
the
constitution
is
an
impediment
to
that,
but
that's
a
separate
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
petersen,
could...
you
are
asking
us
to
affirm
because
although
you
agree
that
the
lower
court
did
not
have
to
take
this
procedural
bar
into
effect,
you
believe
that
it
could,
in
its
discretion,
do
so.
well,
i
don't
see
how
you
get
there
from
here.
the
fact
that
it
could
in
its
discretion
do
so
does
not
establish
that
it
was
exercising
its
discretion.
don't
we
have
to
give
it
a
chance
to
exercise
its
discretion
rather
than
our
exercising
it
on
the
fifth
circuit's
behalf?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless...
unless
the
argument
you're
making
is
that
it
had
no
discretion,
that,
given
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
not...
not
to
raise
the
issue
sua
sponte.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
your
argument
here,
that
it
would
have
been
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
come
out
the
other
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
when
you
say
the
reasons
for
judgment
are
not
under
review.
i
thought
that's
precisely
what
we're
reviewing,
whether
the
belief
which
the
lower
court
had
that
it
must
raise
this
matter
sua
sponte,
which
is
the
reason
for
the
judgment,
whether
that
was
correct.
isn't
that
what
we're
reviewing
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
why
courts
write
opinions,
so
that
we
can
see
if
the
reasons
for
their
judgment
are
okay,
and
that's
why
we
reverse
when
the
reasons
do
not
sustain
the
judgment.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
petersen,
may
i
ask
a
question
about
your
internal
procedures
not
related
to
the
merits
of
this
case?
as
you
see
from
the
discussion
today,
some
very
important
issues
in
the
case
can
be
precluded
by
the
response
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
as
i
understand
what
happened
here,
i
wonder
if
it's
the
standard
procedure
in
louisiana
that
it
is
the
local
prosecutor
who
responds
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
and
that
the
attorney
general's
office
does
not
get
into
the
matter
until
the
petition
is
granted,
is
that
the
case?
