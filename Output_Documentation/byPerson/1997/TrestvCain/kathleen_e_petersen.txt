ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
argument
has
pointed
out
to
this
point,
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent
are
in
agreement
on
the
issue
stated,
and
that
is
whether
or
not
a
federal
court
of
appeal
may,
on
its
own
motion,
invoke
procedural
default,
and
thereby
find
it
is
precluded
from
the
merits
of
the
habeas
claims.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
well,
justice
o'connor--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--justice
o'connor,
if
you
read
the
trest
opinion,
and
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
the
petitioner's...
i
mean,
the
brief
on
the
merits
as
respondent,
we
do
not
read
judge...
the
judge's
opinion,
edith
jones,
to
have
required
the
sua
sponte
invocation--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--the
cert
petition
was
filed
by
the
district
attorney
in
this
matter,
and
the
attorney
general's
office--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--no,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
no.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
no,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
yes,
justice
o'connor.
we
agree,
and
we
feel
that
the
record
that
is
before
the
court
shows
that
that
opinion,
trest
v.
whitley,
was
not
abuse
of
discretion
and
that
the
petitioner
has
not
established
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
therefore
we
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
judgment.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
yes.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
the--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--at
this
point
the
independent
state
ground
is
under
both
louisiana
procedural
post
conviction
law
and
the
mississippi
procedural--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--it
would
be
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--that
it
was
a
successive
petition,
that
it
was
not
properly
presented...
in
our
brief--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--he
was
found
guilty
in
1979.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
the
first
time
it
was
raised
in
state
court
was
in
his
third
application
for
state
post
conviction
relief,
and
it
was
in
1980.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
1980.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
yes...
i'm...
excuse
me,
1990.
i'm--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--the
first
one
was
in
1981.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
1983.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
no,
your
honor,
because
it
has
not
been
presented
to
the
state
court,
and
robisher
dealt
with
the
right
to
appeal.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
it
was
exhausted
by
the
fact
of
the
technical
exhaustion
in
that
it
was
procedurally
barred
at
the
point
it
was
raised.
in
1990,
when
the
petitioner
put
the
claim
in
the
petition
it
was
not
in
the
nine
claims
for
relief.
it
was
attached
in
a
memorandum
of
law
and
no
one
addressed
the
claim.
we
have
termed
it
the
needle
in
the
paper
haystack.
the
trial
judge
in
louisiana
read
claim
number
7
as
being
the
evidence
used
by
the
state
of
louisiana
was
illegal,
and
in
his
written
opinion,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
he
addressed
the
technical
aspects,
whether
or
not
they
were
certified
documents.
there
was
no
discussion
in
that
opinion
at
all
on
the
7(b)
claim,
which
we
have
termed
it
in
our
brief.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
justice
breyer,
a
remand
would
do
no
good
at
this
point.
mr.
trest
is
procedurally
barred
in
louisiana
and
as
we
read
the
post
conviction
articles
he
couldn't
present
the
claim
again
in
louisiana.
in
1990,
when
he
presented
the
claim
to
louisiana,
he
was
procedurally
barred
in
mississippi.
he
was
barred
in
1987
in
mississippi.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
no
louisiana
court
ever
addressed
that
claim.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
well,
he
raised
it
but
it's
not
fairly
presented.
it's
in
a
memorandum
attached.
the
district
attorney,
under
the
state
law,
was
not
ordered
by
the
trial
judge,
and
our
law
did
not
require
the
trial
judge
to
order
the
district
attorney
to
respond,
so
therefore
the
trial
judge
was
without
benefit
of
a
response
by
the
district
attorney
in
1990.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
well,
i
may
agree
with
that,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
if
you
look
at
what
the
petitioner
did
after
his
claim
was
presumptively
ignored
by
the
trial
judge,
he
went
to
federal
court
and
filed
the
exact
same
petition.
and
that
leads
us
to
the
point
that
we
did
file
a
motion
to
enlarge
the
record
based
on
gray
v.
netherland,
and
the
petitioner
has
consented,
and
we
put
into
the
record
all
the
briefs,
and
if
you
examine
all
the
briefs
you
will
plainly
see
that
the
petitioner
had
no
problem
with
the
7(b)
claim
being
ignored,
or
else
he
would
have
brought
it
to
the
federal
court's
attention.
the
magistrate
didn't
look
at
it.
the
district
court
adopted
the
magistrate's
report.
it
wasn't
until
february
of
1994
that
the
petitioner
came
forward
with
the
transcript.
back
in
1990--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--the
mississippi
proceedings.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
justice
souter,
that
is
correct.
the
first
time
that
this
claim
was
ever
brought
to
the
attention
of
any
forum
in
this
form
was
when
the
petitioner
filed
the
objections.
the
district
attorney
did
not
respond
to
those
objections.
the
district
court
did
not
address
the
objections.
it
went
on
to
the
fifth
circuit.
the
fifth
circuit
granted
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
which
the
district
court
had
denied,
and
you
would
think
that
if
the
petitioner
really
had
a
problem
that
his
boykin
claim
was
not
addressed,
and
further
had
a
problem
that
the
7(b)
claim,
which
is
the
right
to
appeal,
right
to
counsel,
and
maximum
sentence,
he
would
have
been
screaming
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
these
courts
have
ignored
me,
and
if
you
look
at
his
brief
in
the
fifth
circuit,
it's
the
exact
same
brief.
the
exact
same
brief
has
been
moving
through
the
system,
and
nobody
has
asked,
was
this
claim
ever
presented
to
the
state
court,
and
the
answer
is
no.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
your
honor--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--the
fifth
circuit--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--i
believe
that
the
fifth
circuit
had
no
fact-finding
whatsoever
on
this
claim.
the
fifth
circuit
was
faced
with
the
objections
that
trest
had
filed
in
the
district
court.
they
were
aware
of
custis
v.
united
states,
and
they
appointed
rebecca
hudsmith
as
counsel
and
ordered
the
parties
to
brief
custis.
the
district
attorney,
who
is
representing
the
state
of
louisiana,
briefed
custis.
they
argued
custody,
and
secondly
they
argued
whether
or
not
this
would
be
a
claim
that
would
be
cognizable
in
habeas.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
i
think
that's
where
granberry
v.
greer
comes
in.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
i
think
it
is
different.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
because
it
closes
the
federal
door
to
the
petitioner.
the
exhaustion
allows
him
to
go
back
and
let
the
states
decide
it
in
the
first
instance.
we
don't
have
that
here
because
of
the
procedural
default,
and
the
procedural
default
is
in
both
mississippi
and
in
louisiana.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
because
the
record
in
this
case
was
clear
in
the
fifth
circuit.
the
district
attorney
did
not
object
when
the
objections
were
filed
by
the
petitioner.
the
fifth
circuit
granted
the
appeal
and
looked
at
the
record.
obviously,
the
petitioner
had
conceded.
he
did
not
object
in
louisiana
back
in
1979
when
the
prosecutor
admitted--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
addressed
the
mississippi
interests.
the
opinion
is
silent
as
to
the
louisiana's
interests,
other
than
the
interest
you
could
infer
that
louisiana
has
the
right
to
presume
that
out-of-state
convictions
are
valid,
and
unless
the
petitioner
draws
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court
either
at
the
time
of
the
habitual
offender
proceedings
or
at
some
time
seasonably
early
in
the
litigation,
the
court
is
on
its
own
motion
looking
for
the
procedural
bar,
and
they
find
a
procedural
bar
in
mississippi.
mississippi
has
an
interest
in
the
finality
of
its
judgments.
whether
or
not
trest
returns
to
the
state
of
mississippi
is
an
open
question.
but
they
also
have
an
interest
in
the
procedural
rules,
and
they
allow
trest
11
years
to
litigate
in
mississippi.
the
door
in
mississippi
closed
in
1987,
and
he
didn't
even
file
the
claim
until
1990.
he
waited
3
years
past--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--justice
stevens,
i'm
sure
that
happens.
in
kubick
v.
whitley,
a
case
cited
by
the
petitioner,
the
fifth
circuit
would
not
invoke
sua
sponte
procedural
default
and
proceeded
to
the
merits.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
yes,
chief
justice.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
to
be
honest,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
haven't
practiced
much
in
the
fifth
circuit
because
i'm
a
state
prosecutor,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
that
unusual.
obviously,
when
that
happened
the
district
attorney
should
have
lodged
procedural
objections,
but
for
whatever
reason,
which
is
not
in
the
record,
he
did
not.
the
judgment
is
correct,
and
this
court
sits
to
review
judgments.
you
can
justify
it
with
the
mississippi
interest,
which
is
an
independent
and
adequate
state
bar,
and
the
petitioner
has
not
claimed
it
was
not
an
adequate
and
independent
state
bar
until
argument
today.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
we
don't
read
the
opinion
that
they
felt
like
they
were
obligated.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
well,
chief
justice,
we
do
agree
that
a
remand
in
light
of
granberry
v.
greer
would...
may
be
proper.
however,
it
is
not
necessary
on
the
record
as
it
appears
before
the
court.
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
record,
both
as
it
was
in
the
fifth
circuit
and
as
it
is
presented
to
this
court,
that
there
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
yes,
your
honor,
but
the
reasonings
for
judgment
are
not
for
review,
it's
the
judgment
itself,
and
if
you
feel
by
looking
at
the
record
that
under
granberry
v.
greer
there
was
an
adequate
federal
interest,
remanding
it
back,
certainly
we
would
not
oppose
that,
but
i
think
that
at
this
point
the
remand
would
be
unnecessary
and
that
the
decision--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--well,
justice
scalia,
the
opinion
is
solid
as
far
as
the
propriety
of
invoking
sua
sponte
default,
procedural
default.
they
did,
and
when
we
were
writing
the
brief--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--and
we
must
concede
that
there
is
no
language
in
the
opinion
that
addresses
their
power
as
a
federal
court
to
invoke--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--well,
justice
stevens,
i
read
that
language
that
they
were
precluded
by
coleman
v.
thompson.
in
the
sones
opinion
that
was
a
mississippi
prisoner
attacking
a
mississippi
conviction.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
you
had
not...
we
have
a
louisiana
prison...
prisoner
attacking
the
use
of
mississippi
convictions
in
a
louisiana
federal
court,
so
sones
was
not
exactly
on
point.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
and
we
believe...
that's
why
we
built
the
record.
we
believe
that
the
judgment
was
correct
to
deny
relief
to
this
petitioner.
we
believe
that
mississippi
had
a
valid
interest.
we
believe
that
the
reasoning
in
sones
showing
that
if
you're
going
to
attack
a
mississippi
conviction,
and
this
is
phillips
v.
state,
you
must
return
to
the
court
in
mississippi
that
gave
you
the
judgment.
in
this
case,
the
petitioner
clearly
bypassed
the
state
of
mississippi.
he
was
found
a
habitual
offender
in
june
of
1979.
he
had
until
1987
to
go
back
to
mississippi,
and
he
did
not.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
that
is
correct.
the
district
attorneys
in
louisiana
have
the
power
and
authority
for
all
cases
in
their
districts.
the
attorney
general
is
involved
only
at
their
request,
and
when...
or
a
conflict
of
interest
as
well,
but
in
this
case
it
was
a
request
by
the
district
attorney
to
handle
the
case
on
july
7,
1997.
that
was
after
the
writ
was
granted,
and
when
we
prepared
the
brief
on
the
merits
we
were
looking
forward
to
the
issue
of
whether
granberry
v.
greer
should
be
extended
to
encompass
procedural
default.
quite
honestly,
i
think
that
the
parties
here
agree
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
not
required,
and
therefore
there
is
no
dispute
on
that.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
and
justice
kennedy--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--it
is,
justice
kennedy,
and
we
read
that
to
believe
that
they've
looked
at
the
record
for
cause
and
prejudice,
that
they
felt
that
the
record
did
not
establish
it,
and
therefore
denied
relief.
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
read
that
correctly,
is
that
they
looked
at
the
record,
they
felt
that
the
petitioner
could
have
shown
cause...
if
you
look
at
the
objections
to
the
magistrate's
report--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
we
believe
that's
the
next
question,
and
we
do
not...
in
our
brief
we
do
not
state
that
it
was
one
that
was
fairly
encompassed
in
the
question
presented.
however,
i
would
answer
that
by
saying
that
the
petitioner
did
have
an
opportunity
when
he
filed
the
objections
to
the
magistrate's
report,
because
if
you
look
at
his
answer,
you
see
that
he
is
admitting
new
evidence,
a
transcript,
in
1994
from
a
1979
conviction
which
was
transcribed
in
june
of
19...
excuse
me,
june
of
1976.
it
was
a
may
of
1976
conviction.
he
brings
this
new
evidence,
he
cites
new
case
law,
and
he
cites
boykin
v.
alabama
for
the
first
time
for
that
proposition.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
well...
no,
go
ahead
if
you--
--yes,
your
honor.
so--
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
--yes,
justice
breyer.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
yes,
justice
breyer.
you
would
have
to
find
that
the
fifth
circuit
abused
its
discretion
by
invoking
mississippi
law.
ms.
kathleen
e.
petersen
well,
i
think
you
can
justify
it
in
that
the
state
of
mississippi
was
never
given
any
opportunity
to
pass
on
these
convictions
despite
the
fact
that
trest
was
on
notice
in
june
of
1979
in
louisiana
that
they
were
being
used
for
enhancement,
and
he
had
in
the
state
of
mississippi
till
1987.
so
therefore
you
have
the
state
of
mississippi
affording
this
petitioner
an
opportunity,
clearly
knowing
the
state
of
louisiana
is
using
these
five
other
prior
felonies,
and
not
going
to
the
state
of
mississippi.
meanwhile,
you
have
the
interest
of
the
state
of
louisiana
in
presuming
that
that
judgments...
those
judgments
are
valid,
and
furthermore,
he
had
two
options.
he
could
have
either
gone
to
the
state
court
in
louisiana...
our
position
is
that
in
1990
the
claim
was
not
fairly
presented.
he
could
have
gone
back
to
the
state
of
mississippi
up
to
the
year
1987.
he
didn't
even
raise
the
boykin
claim
until
1994.
clearly,
the
petitioner
had
options
in
either
state.
he's
foreclosed
in
either
state.
therefore,
there's
a
procedural
bar
in
either
state,
and
that
would
support
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit.
ms.
kathleen
