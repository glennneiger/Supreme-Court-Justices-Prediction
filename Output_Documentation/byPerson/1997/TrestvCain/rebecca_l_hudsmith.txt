ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
a
federal
court
as
a
general
proposition
is
not
and
ought
not
be
obligated
to
raise
a
nonjurisdictional
defense
such
as
procedural
default
when
the
party
to
the
proceeding
has
failed
to
raise
that
defense
itself.
in
this
case,
in
the
opinion
below
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
evidences
a
belief
that
it
must
have
raised,
had
to
raise,
was
obligated
to
raise
what
it
perceived
to
be
a
defense
of
procedural
default
and
deny
the
merits
of
the
petitioner's
claim
on
that
basis.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
that
is
the
cert
question
presented.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
i
actually
think
we
can
and
ought
to
go
a
little
further,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say,
justice
scalia,
that
the
federal
court--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--can.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
it
has
the
power
to
raise
a
waived
defense
that
is
nonjurisdictional,
but
it
ought
not
to
without
first
giving
the
parties
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
it...
and
in
this
context
of
procedural
default
it
ought
to
do
so
only
rarely.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
that
is
the
most
obvious
remedy
that
we
would
ask
for
and
hope
this
court
would
grant.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
no,
your
honor.
i
agree
that
when
a
case
gets
this
far
and
is
before
this
court
and,
given
the
different
opinions
that
are
available
to
be
read
in
the
courts
of
appeals
on
this
issue,
that
is
when
the
court
should
raise
procedural
defaults
sua
sponte.
i
think
this
court
should
give
the
courts
of
appeal,
then
the
court
of
appeal
below,
more
guidance
than
that,
and
i'm
prepared
to
offer
what
guidance
i
can
to
the
court
in
that
regard.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
i
will
acknowledge,
justice
o'connor,
that,
unlike
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
in
granberry,
where
the
court
of
appeals
apparently
concluded
that
it
could
not
ignore
a
waiver,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
opinion
below
did
not
say
that.
however,
the
court
must
have
known,
because
the
dissent,
in
the
form
of
the
hon.
richard
parker,
made
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
state
had
never
raised
the
defense
of
procedural
default
and
ought
to
be
barred
as
a
result.
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion,
despite
the
lack
of
information
from
the
court
on
the
significance
of
that,
that
its
failure,
that
the
panel
majority's
failure
to
even
discuss
that,
in
effect,
if
you
will,
state
procedural
default,
means
that
it
felt
obligated,
no
matter,
to
do
what
it
did,
and
that
is
to
decide
the
claim
against
the
petitioner
on
the
basis
of
what
it
perceived
to
be
a
procedural
default,
and
the
opinion
does--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--yes,
sir.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
they
didn't
address
the
issue,
that
i'm
aware
of,
that--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--that
is,
and
that
certainly--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--well--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--the
state...
and
i
know
they
can
speak
better
to
this
than
i,
but
the
state
does
take
the
position
that
the
opinion
can
be
read
more
broadly.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
i
am
not
aware
of
that,
your
honor.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
narrow...
there's
a
very
narrow
issue
presented
to
this
court
in
the
question
presented.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
that
is.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
yes,
sir.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
and
i'm
prepared
to
speak
to
that,
but
i'm
also
prepared
to
speak
more
broadly
if
the
court
so
desires
to
whether,
beyond
a
remand,
the
court,
this
court
should
provide
guidance
to
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
absolutely.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
i
agree.
i
believe,
however,
your
honor,
that
a
reading
of
the
opinion
is...
and
it
is
fairly
read
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
the
court
did
feel
obliged.
it
uses
the
language,
precluded,
that
it
is
precluded--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--and
i
would
maintain
that
position,
and
i
think
that
that
is
supported
by
a
fair
reading
of
the
opinion
itself.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
well--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--the
way
the
question's
framed,
it
doesn't
matter,
but
i'm
certainly
aware
of
the
context
in
which
this
case
comes
to
this
court,
and
it
is
one
in
which
my
client,
who
is
in
custody
at
angola,
at
louisiana
state
penitentiary
at
angola,
and
is
challenging
a
louisiana
enhanced
sentence,
does
so,
among
many
reasons,
because
he
believes
the
underlying
mississippi
convictions
were
constitutionally
invalid
and
should
not
be
used
to
enhance.
and
in
the
state's
brief
in
response...
and
i
might
add
that,
given
we
were
not
given
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
only
knew
of
the
court's
stance
on
the
case
with
the
opinion
being
issued,
the
brief
was
really
the
first
time
i
had
and
the
first
time
the
state
really
had
to
really
join
issue,
if
you
will,
on
this
very
complex
topic,
i
think,
but--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--that's
correct
and,
of
course,
if
we
had
given
an
opportunity
to
speak
to
the
issue,
the
petitioner
would
have
argued
that
that
was
no
procedural
default
at
all.
getting
back
really
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
posed
and
you've
added
to,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
question
becomes,
what
is
the
significance
of
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
an
underlying
mississippi
conviction?
in
fact,
the
louisiana
judgment
for
which
the
petitioner
stands
in
custody
is
not
based
in
any
way,
shape,
or
form
on
his
having
defaulted
procedurally
by
failing
to
first
go
to
mississippi
and
attack
those
convictions.
so
in
a
very
real
sense,
in
fact
in
every
sense
that
i
can
think
of,
there
is
no
adequate
and
independent
state
law
ground
from
mississippi
supporting
this
judgment.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
i
agree
with
that.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
well,
certainly
the
state
in
its
brief
in
response
has...
has
for
the
first
time,
justice
breyer,
i
might
add,
suggested
that
the
claim,
as
you've
just
described
it,
was
not
fairly
presented
to
the
state
courts
in
the
petitioner's--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--well,
i
would
have
two
responses
to
that
question.
one
is,
and
i
think
it's
the
very
first
and
most
important
one,
and
it
gets
back
to
a
point
that
justice
scalia
made
about
this
court
knowing
what
it
has
before
it
on
the
table
when
it
decides
to
exercise
its
scarce
judicial
resources
and
grant
a
cert
petition,
that
the
state
at
least
as
late
as
the
opposition
to
the
cert
petition,
should
have
raised
the
issue
of
exhaustion
and
did
not,
and
therefore
this
court
ought
to
consider
that
defense
waived
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
that
would
be
my
first
and
foremost
posture.
secondly,
i'm
not
prepared
to
concede,
based
upon
this
record,
your
honor,
that
in
fact
the
claim
was
not
fairly
presented
in
some
form
to
the
state
courts
in
the
petition
filed
in
1990
by
the
petitioner.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
he
did--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--he
said
that
it
was
obscurely
framed
and
that
the
claim,
something
to
the
effect
was
floating
in
muddy
waters,
and
even
the
fifth
circuit
acknowledged
that
he
had
to
elucidate
more
on
the
claim
and
did
so
in
his
objections
to
the
magistrate's
report
which
were
filed
in
1994.
but
again,
it
gets
back
to
the
point
that
i
made
earlier
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
point,
and
that
is
that
the
state
then
certainly,
before
the
district
court
ruled
on
the
case,
could
have
responded
and,
i
might
add,
quite
simply,
particularly
with
the
petitioner
making
note
of
the
fact
that
the
claim
wasn't...
wasn't
well-articulated
before,
they
could
have
filed
a
one-page
statement
saying,
this
claim
has
not
been
exhausted
in
the
state
courts.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
the
question
that
i
framed
is
very
narrow,
i
will
admit,
but--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--beyond
the
answer
to
the
narrow
question,
what
i
am
saying,
and
i
want
to
be
heard
very
clearly
as
saying,
just
in
case
it's
not
clear
enough
in
the
brief,
that
once
we
go
beyond
that
very
narrow
question,
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
to
the
extent
that
a
federal
court
can
raise
a
waived
or
forfeited
nonjurisdictional
defense,
it
should
only
do
so
in
very
rare
circumstances,
and
in
the
context
of
a
procedural
default
defense
it
should
do
so
even
in
more
rare
circumstances
than
those
presented
in
granberry
v.
greer.
because
granberry
v.
greer,
which
is
a
very
instructive
case
but
not
controlling,
of
course,
on
this
issue,
concerned
the
defense
of
exhaustion,
and
in
very
many
important
respects
exhaustion
is
a
different...
it
is
a
different
defense,
it
serves
different
purposes,
and
its
consequences
are
much
graver.
and
so
i
want
to
be
clear
that...
and
i
want
to
be
heard
to
say
that
the
fifth
circuit
not
only
was
not
obligated
to
raise
the
procedural
default
defense
that
it
believed
existed,
but
it
ought
not
to
have
done
so
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
and
i
think
appropriately
the
federal
courts
in
general
ought
not
to
raise
such
a
defense
except
in
very
rare
circumstances
where,
maybe
because
of
comity,
and
maybe
because
of
concerns
of
finality,
it
is
indeed
appropriate
for
a
federal
court
to
save
the
state
from
itself.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
absolutely
not.
the
first
court
to
hear
the
parties
on
this
issue
is
this
court.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
yes,
sir.
it
was
not
an
issue
ever
even
mentioned
in
the
oral
argument
in
the
case,
and--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--the
louisiana
courts
were
certainly
put
on
notice
with
the
petition
filed
by
the
petitioner
in
1990
in
the
state
court
that
he
was
attacking
the
constitutional
validity
of
his
mississippi
conviction
to
be
used
for
the
collateral
consequence
of
enhancing
his
louisiana
conviction,
and
at...
of
enhancing
his
louisiana
sentence,
and
undoubtedly
at
that
point
a
louisiana
court
could
have
and,
if
it
wanted
to,
was
put
on
notice
that
it
could
say
no,
mr.
trest,
you
must
first
go
to
mississippi.
but
in
fact,
louisiana
is
more
generous
than
mississippi
and
more
generous
in...
than
the
federal
court
in
the
custis
case
in
allowing
in
the
first
instance
in
a
habitual
offender
proceeding
an
attack
by
the
defendant
on
the
voluntary
and
intelligent
nature
of
the
guilty
plea
that
forms
a
basis
for
prior
conviction
and,
likewise,
in
post
conviction
proceedings.
and
i
might
add
that
even
a
failure
on
the
part
of
the
petitioner
which
he
must
acknowledge
to
have
objected
on
this
basis
at
the
habitual
offender
proceeding
does
not
prohibit
under
louisiana
law
his
raising
this
issue
in
post
conviction
proceedings.
so
what
i'm
saying,
i
hope
in
answer
to
your
question,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
the
louisiana
court
was
certainly
put
on
notice
it
could
have
raised
the
issue
of
a
"procedural
bar".
it
did
not,
and
there
is
none,
then,
to
support
this
state
court
judgment
such
that
a
procedural
default
should
be
found
or
is
in
order.
and
i
would
suggest,
and
this
really
sort
of
gets
back
to
justice
o'connor's
initial
question,
that
the
fact
that
mississippi
may
have
some
vague,
or
attenuated,
or
some
interest
in
its
judgment,
it
is
not
so
great
to
create
a
procedural
bar.
there
must
first
be...
the
judgment
that
we
must
focus
on
is
the
louisiana
judgment,
and
it's
not
supported
by
a
mississippi
bar,
and
so
we've
got
interest
in
the
air,
if
you
will,
and
that's
hardly
a
basis
for
a
federal
court
to
refuse
to
exercise
its
power.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
i
would
think
that
is.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
yes,
justice
stevens.
that
is
a
very
critical
point,
and
that
is
that
the
mississippi
conviction
that
was
imposed
back
in
1976
is
final,
and
the
petitioner
has
served
his
time.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
he's
not
revisiting
that
issue.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
yes.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
and
i
haven't,
i
don't
think,
been
heard
to
say
that
mississippi
has
no
interest.
i
acknowledge
that
it
has
some
interest
in
general
in
terms
of
the
finality
of
its
judgment.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
absolutely.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
absolutely.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
my
initial
reaction
is
that
no,
there
wouldn't
be,
that
whether
it
be
in
the
context
of
a
mississippi
attempt
to
enhance
a
sentence
because
of
a
mississippi
conviction
or
otherwise,
that
mississippi,
because
it
wasn't
a
party
to
this
action,
ought
not
be
precluded
from
defending
its...
both
its
conviction
and
asserting
its
procedural
laws
that
the
petitioner
failed
to
comply
with
vis-a-vis
mississippi.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
sure,
but--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--but
that's
the
nature
of
the
beast
when
it
comes
to
enhanced
punishments.
that
is
happening
all
the
time,
certainly
in
louisiana,
where,
in
the
habitual
offender
proceeding
itself,
a
defendant
can
call
into
question
the
validity
of
a
guilty
plea.
so
it's
happening,
and
surely
we're
not
going
to
stop
that
and
not
allow...
again,
i
feel
like
i'm
speaking
up
for
louisiana
here,
because
louisiana
has
its
own
rules
and
its
own
procedures,
and
they
say
we
can
look
beyond
this
judgment
if
it's
presented
to
us
in
the
right
way
and
it's
compelling.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
i
think
that
that...
that's
the
way
it
is,
and
mississippi
could
do
the
same
with
louisiana's
judgments.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
this...
i
don't
think
that
when
we're
dealing
with--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--i
don't
think...
i
don't
think
what
we're
talking
about
here,
that
is,
louisiana
or
any
other
state
determining
whether
it
wants
to
impose
collateral
consequences
in
its
state
on
its
sentence
with
respect
to
another
state's
judgment
raises
an
issue
of
full
faith
and
credit.
again,
and
i
think--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--absolutely,
louisiana
doesn't
even
have
to
have
a
habitual--
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
--your
honor,
my
response
to
that
would
be
that
first
of
all
the...
louisiana,
like
mississippi,
now
has
a
prescriptive
period,
if
you
will,
that's
what
we
call
it
in
louisiana,
for
when
a
petitioner
who
is
in
prison
in
louisiana
can
bring
a
post
conviction
proceeding,
so
the
oldness
of
these
claims
is,
i
think,
going
to
lessen
as
more
and
more
states
like
louisiana
and
mississippi
adopt
these
bars,
these
time
bars
to
these
claims.
but
i
think
it's
even
more
unseemly
for
us
to
allow
a
federal
court,
or
to
give
a
federal
court
the
authority,
or
even
require
a
federal
court
to
ignore
a
state's
procedural
default
because
of
negligence
or
inadvertence
or
whatever,
when
at
the
same
time
this
court's
jurisprudence
clearly
holds
that
the
petitioner's
inadvertence
or
negligence
does
not
save
him
from
his
procedural
default
and,
as
we
know,
there
are
petitioners
in
those
circumstances
who
have
been
executed
because
of
that
inadvertence
or
negligence.
so
yes,
it
has
been
a
long
time,
and
i
think
these
cases
will
be
less
and
less
so
because
of
these
time
limitations
imposed
now
by
the
state
systems,
but
i
think
it's
an
appropriate
response
and
more
unseemly
to
allow
the
state
to
be
forgiven
its
procedural
bar
or
default.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i--
ms.

--the
bottom
line
very
narrow
question
is
reverse
the
u.s.
fifth
circuit
and
remand
it
for
further
proceedings,
but
i
think
those
further
proceedings
ought
to
include
a
caution
or
instruction,
if
you
will,
that
the
court
ought
to
give
the
parties
notice
and
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
issue,
first
of
all,
and
secondarily
that
the
court
ought
not
freely
forgive
a
state
procedural
default,
but
ought
to
do
it
only
in
a
rare
circumstance,
which
we
contend,
the
petitioner
contends
does
not
exist
here.
ms.
rebecca
l.
hudsmith
i
would
waive
the
remaining
oral
argument
unless
the
court
has
questions
of
me.
