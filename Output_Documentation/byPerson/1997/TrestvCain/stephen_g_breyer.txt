justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
might
be
one
from
louisiana.
i
mean,
as
i
understood
it,
when
i'd
gotten
through
this,
it's
quite...
i
don't
know
where
to
begin
in
this,
and
i'm
reluctant
to
hold
them
to
an
answer
they
had
to
give
to
a
question
that
had
four
parts,
and
it
was
an
ifp
petition,
and
there
were...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
much
i
should
hold
them
to
what
they've
written
in
three
pages
there.
but
the
federal
constitutional
question,
as
i'd
understood
it,
would
be
whether
the
state
of
louisiana
can
increase
an
offender's
sentence
on
the
basis
of
convictions
in
a
different
state,
which
convictions
either
resulted
from
a
guilty
plea
where
he
was
not
told
about
his
right
to
appeal,
or
resulted
from
a
guilty
plea
that
was
involuntary,
or
both,
and
they're
collaterally
estopped
from
attacking
it,
they
can't
attack
it
in
mississippi.
that's
the
federal
constitutional
question,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
that's
the
federal
constitutional
question,
i
can't
find
it
raised
anywhere,
ever,
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
of
course
they
didn't
answer
it,
because
it's
never
been
raised.
the
closest
you
could
come
is
something
like
the
appeal
part
of
it,
where
in
fact
what's
cited
is
a
louisiana
case,
and
then
a
reference
to
this
case
of
griffin,
so
i
would
think
that
that
wasn't
exhausted.
i
don't...
i
don't...
it's
never
been
raised,
and
there
could
well
be
an
independent
ground
that
you
can't,
you
know,
go
through
five
proceedings
in
louisiana
and
never
raise
this
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
see
it
presented
at
all,
and
if
i'm
right
about
that,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
now?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
how
does
the...
is...
you're
saying
they're
not
required,
but
they're
permitted
to
assert
an
independent
state
ground.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
even
if
that
state
ground
doesn't
exist?
i'm
curious
to
know
what
is
the
independent
state
ground
that
louisiana
could
have
affirmed
this
conviction
on.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
that
he
filed
the
habeas...
he
filed
the
collateral...
petition
for
collateral
relief
in
state
court.
it
was
denied,
and
what
is
the
independent
state
ground
on
which
louisiana
could
have
denied
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
that
it
states
that
would
provide
an
independent
state
ground
for
affirming
the
conviction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
want
the
citation.
i
want
the
proposition
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
it's
successive...
my
impression,
and
here
you
can
correct
me,
because
i...
i
thought
that
he
initially
pleaded
guilty
at
his
trial
and
was
sentenced
and
didn't
appeal,
and
that's
sometime
around
1980,
and
then
he
brought
this
petition
in
about
1990-something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying...
isn't
that
basically
what
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
19--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--his
third
application
for
post
conviction
relief
was
in
1980?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
was
the
first?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
when
was
the
second?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
i
assume
he'll
argue
that
this
third
one,
he
didn't
really
know
that
he
had
a
federal
claim
until
the
louisiana
courts
decided
robisher
and
he
had
a
chance
to
digest
it,
and
because
robisher
was
the
first
time
that
anybody
had
suggested
under
louisiana
law,
in
reference
to
federal
law,
that
there
could
be
some
kind
of
claim
here.
i
suppose
that
will
be
the
argument,
as...
and...
whether
he
had
a
chance
to
do
it
before
or
not.
is
it
clear
how
that
argument
will
come
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
so
then
you're
saying
whether
or
not
there
is
an
adequate
state
ground
has
not
yet
been
presented
to
the
louisiana
court,
and
therefore
that
hasn't
been
exhausted,
and
therefore,
what?
therefore
this
is
a
case
that,
although
you
conceded
exhaustion,
it
wasn't
exhausted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
be
straightforward
with
you.
the
reason
i'm
asking
these
questions
is
in
my
mind
is
the
tentative
idea...
i'm
certainly
not
wedded
to
it...
that
the
correct
result
here
is
to
say,
of
course
they're
not
required
to
assert
this
on
their
own,
but
was
it
an
abuse
of
discretion
here
to
do
so?
yes,
because
this
is
a
case
where
there
was
no
exhaustion.
indeed,
there
is
a
big
question
as
to
whether
or
not
there
is
an
adequate
state
ground,
so
it
is
a
case,
under
granberry,
where,
despite
the
state's
concession,
it
should
be
remanded
to
the
state
courts
to
give
people
an
opportunity
to
decide
whether
there
is
or
is
not
some
state
ground
that
would
bar
it.
now,
i
have
no...
that's
quite
tentative.
i
mean,
i'm
not
advocating
that.
i'm
trying
to...
what's
your
reaction
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let's
go
to...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
this,
in
my...
what
i
think
we
should
do
here.
suppose
we
said...
all
right,
suppose
you
answer
the
question,
required,
of
course
they're
not
required.
all
right.
the
next
step
would
be
we
remand,
and
i
take
it
one
possible
thing
to
do
would
be
to
explain
when
a
court
has
the
power,
or
when
it
lacks
the
power
under
the
law
to,
sua
sponte,
or
in
the
face
of
a
refusal
by
the
state
to
raise
the
issue,
assert
a
claim
of
an
independent
state
ground.
now,
if
you
were
trying
to
write
that
paragraph
of
when
it
does
and
when
it
doesn't,
what
does
it
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exhaustion
is
the
same
as
independent
state
ground?
i'm
not
sure.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
can
i
ask
you...
are
you
finished
with--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
well,
can
i
ask...
i
want
to
ask
you
this...
try
a
third
minimalist
approach.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
minimalist.
is
there
any
answer
to
at
least
the
minimalist?
the
question
before
us
is
whether
they
were
required.
there's
no
objection
that
that's
the
question,
and
clearly
they're
not
required
to
bring
it
up.
the
state
then
argues
that
despite
that
they
have
the
power
to
bring
it
up,
and
this
was
not
an
abuse
of
discretion.
but
one
thing
that
is
clear
is
that
it
is
an
abuse
of
discretion
to
assert
an
independent
state
ground
to
bar
a
petitioner's
claim
when
you
assert
the
wrong
independent
state
ground,
an
independent
state
ground
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
or
at
least
very
little,
since
it
had
to
do
with
mississippi
and
we're
interested
in
louisiana.
at
least
that's
an
abuse
of
discretion.
now,
there
are
many
other
issues
that
have
been
raised
in
this
very
interesting
set
of
briefs,
et
cetera,
and
we'll
leave
those
for
the
court
of
appeals.
all
right.
is
there
any
answer
to
that,
as
a
minimal
approach?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
reason
is
because
of
course,
as
you've
heard,
to
focus
you
right
on
it,
that
the
question
is
whether
the
constitution
bars
louisiana
from
taking
this
mississippi
conviction
into
account
when
it
increases
a
punishment,
a
matter
that
perhaps
has
never
even
been
argued.
now,
go
ahead.
