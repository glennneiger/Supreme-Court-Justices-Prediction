justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
wasn't
certain,
in
reading
the
fifth
circuit
opinion,
that
it
thought
it
was
obligated
to
do
this.
it
wasn't
all
that
clear
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
answer...
does
it
make
any
difference,
in
answering
the
question
that
you
raise,
that
here
we
have
some
convictions
from
another
state,
a
state
other
than
louisiana--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
are
being
challenged?
does
that
matter?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i--
--well,
i
didn't
think
that
was
what
the
petitioner
had
raised.
i
thought
we
had
spent
a
lot
of
time
already
this
morning
establishing
that
the
narrow
question
presented
is
whether
the
court
of
appeals
is
required
on
its
own
motion
to
consider
this
matter.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
you
tell
us
that
in
response
to
the
cert
petition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
just
answer
the
question.
were
we
told
that
in
response
to
the
cert
petition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
then,
are
you
going
to
argue
on
the
narrow
question,
as
framed
in
the
cert
petition,
was
the
fifth
circuit
required--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
raise
it
sua
sponte?
what
do
you
say
in
answer
to
that?
was
it
required
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
agree
with
the
petitioner.
