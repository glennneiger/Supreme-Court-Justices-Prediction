kennedy
is
it
clear
that
louisiana
could
not
have...
the
louisiana
courts
could
not
have
examined
this
question,
and
the
validity
of
and
the
existence
of
the
alleged
bar
in
mississippi?
the
louisiana
courts
never
even
looked
at
that,
did
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
would
think
either
from
the
standpoint
of
discretion
or
the
mandatory
rule
when
a
third
state,
or
a
second
state's
interest
is
involved
here,
mississippi,
and
they're
not
before
it,
but
that
is
a
compelling
case
for
not
allowing
the
question
to
be
presented.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
will
have
to
say
that
i
think
there's
merit
to
the
petitioner's
argument
that
you
should
read
the
fifth
circuit's
opinion
that
way.
after
the
passage
justice
stevens
quoted
the
fifth
circuit
says,
again,
the
supreme
court
has
explained
that
procedural
default
will
block
all
federal
review
unless
there's
cause
and
prejudice.
