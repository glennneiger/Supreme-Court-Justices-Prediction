chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-7901,
richard
f.
trest
v.
burl
cain.
ms.
hudsmith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
an
extremely
narrow
point,
perhaps
narrower
than
i
thought
the
question
presented.
you
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
could,
under
granberry
v.
greer,
perhaps,
have
raised
this
point
but
it
wasn't
obligated
to.
you
read
its
opinion
to
say
it
thought
it
was
obligated
to,
so
then
we
would
remand
it
and
tell
the
court
of
appeals
you
may
do
it
but
it's
a
matter
of
discretion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
our
cases
previously,
cases
like
granberry
v.
greer
and
others,
have
talked
about
a
procedural
default
in
the
sense
of
failing
to
raise
something
in
louisiana,
where
the...
where
your
client
hypothet...
or
not
hypothetically,
actually
is
held
in
custody.
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
focused
on
was
a
failure...
the
fact
that
you
could
not
now
go
back
and
raise
something
in
mississippi.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
supposing
that
the
petitioner
succeeds
in
his
present
action,
and
then
he
commits
another
offense
in
mississippi,
and
mississippi
says
we're
going
to
commit
you
on
the
basis
of
our
habitual
offender
statute,
and
your
client
says
no,
you
can't
do
that,
because
in
the
federal
proceedings
in
louisiana
it
was
held
that
these...
this
conviction
was
invalid.
certainly
mississippi
would
have--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--perhaps
not
a
very
direct
interest,
but
you
can't
say
it
has
no
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hudsmith.
ms.
petersen,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
louisiana
courts
ever
say
that
he
was
procedurally
barred
in
louisiana
from
raising
his
claims
against
the
mississippi
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
because
what,
he
had
never
raised
it?
he
says
he
raised
it,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
the
claim
was
raised,
but
the
district
attorney
didn't
respond
to
it,
you
would
think
that
that
was
at
least
preserved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
transcript
of
the
mississippi
proceedings,
or
the
louisiana
proceedings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
this
case
they
did
ask
for...
request
briefing
on
custis,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
unusual,
that
the
court
would
ask
for
a
briefing,
the
fifth
circuit
would
ask
for
a
briefing
on
a
particular
issue,
or
is
that...
do
they
always
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
if
we
decide
the
narrow
question
presented,
which
one
certainly
hopes
we
will,
it
would
be
possible
to
conclude
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
bound
to
raise
this
but
perhaps
could
have
raised
it
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
and
you
say,
i
take
it,
that
even
if
that
is
so,
it
would
have
properly
exercised
its
discretion
to
prevent
the...
to
raise
this
question
on
its
own,
but
isn't
it
best
left
for
them
to
decide
that
exercising
their
discretion,
as
they're
now
told
to
do,
rather
than
feeling
that
they're
obligated
to
do
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
i
think
you're
foreclosed
by
your
failure
to
respond
to...
your
brief
in
opposition
to
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
petersen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
hudsmith,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
hudsmith.
the
case
is
submitted.
