justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
petitioner
himself
recognized
that
the...
that
it
was
obscure...
i
forgot
what
the
words
were,
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--obscurely
presented,
or
inarticulate,
or
something.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
i--
--they
didn't...
i'm
sorry.
did
i
understand
you
to
say
at
the
outset
that
this
really
is
very
narrow
because
you're
not
objecting
to
the
authority
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
raise
the
procedural
default
sua
sponte.
the
only
thing
you're
objecting
to
is
the
notion
that
they
must
do
so.
is
that
true?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
do
you...
you're
not
saying
that
they
couldn't
do
the
same
thing
here
as
in
granberry.
that
is
to
say,
exhaustion
and
procedural
default,
they're
very
much
alike,
so
it's
something
that
the
court
can
bring
up
on
its
own.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
doesn't
have
to
have--
--well,
you
say
that--
--an
habitual
offender
statute,
so
the
mississippi
judgment
had
no
effect
by
its
own
force.
louisiana
doesn't
have
to
have--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
when
you
stand
back
from
all
of
this,
and
what
you're
left
with
is
a
very
old
mississippi...
finally
he
served
his
time,
and
it's
been
years
ago,
and
he
doesn't
raise
this
till
very
late,
and
you
tell
us,
ah,
but
the
state
defaulted
because
it
didn't
object
on
that
basis,
isn't
there
something
unseemly
about
allowing
a
defendant
so
many
years
after
to
raise
this
issue
and
say,
he
can
get
by
because
the
state
out
of
carelessness,
which
seems
to
be
what
happens
here,
didn't
object?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
your
bottom
line
is,
facing
your
narrow
question,
what
are
you
asking
this
court
to
do?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
we
go
back--
--all
right,
so
what
you're
suggest--
--one
step,
because
there's
a
large
concern
here,
i
think,
with
a
court
raising
a
nonjurisdictional
question
on
its
own,
and
if
you
think
of
the
two
models
of
procedure,
there's
the
adversary
system
that
we
follow,
and
the
inquisitorial
one
that
we
don't
follow,
and
the
ordinary
rule
is
that
judges
are
obliged
to
bring
up
jurisdictional
issues
on
their
own,
but
for
the
rest,
we
follow
the
principle
of
party
presentation,
and
if
a
party
doesn't
bring
it
up
then
it's
forfeited,
or
waived.
so
why
is
this
so
special
that
it
would
be
ranked
kind
of
like
jurisdiction,
that
we
would
let
a
court
deviate
from
the
normal
party
presentation
rule
to
bring
it
up
on
its
own,
even
though
the
state
didn't
raise
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
seem
to
be
making
all
kinds
of
arguments
that
would
have
strengthened
the
state's
plea
if
it
had
made
it,
but
it
didn't
make
it,
and
that's...
you're
saying
there
was
a
terrific
defense
that
the
state
had
here,
and
because
it
was
so
good,
the
court
of
appeals
can
make
it
for
them.
that's
what
i've
heard
you
say
so
far.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
there
was
no
objection
by
the
state,
if
this
wasn't
in
the
case
until
the
fifth
circuit
put
it
there,
then
how
could
you
expect
the
petitioner
to
come
up
with
cause
and
prejudice?
he
was...
to
anticipate
a
defense
that
wasn't
there
and
answer
it,
that's
very
strange,
so
it
does
suggest
that
at
least
he
should
have
had
an
opportunity
to
address
the
cause
and
prejudice
issue.
