unknown
speaker
incidentally...
and
i
want
you
to
keep
on
this
vein
so
far
as
i'm
concerned,
but
do
you
have
to...
in
order
to
prevail,
do
you
have
to
convince
us
both
of
the
sovereign
immunity
point
and
of
the
statute
of
limitations
point
under
the
quiet
title
act?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
they
want
to
set
aside
the
settlement,
or
something.
unknown
speaker
--made
the
claim
preclusion
argument
was
the
one
as
i
was
reading
your
brief,
and
i
said,
what
is
this
about
equitable
tolling,
statute
of
limitations?
why
didn't
the
government
just
say
claim
preclusion?
we
already
had
a
quiet
title
action.
unknown
speaker
even
apart
from
that,
why
don't
you,
as
to
damages,
also
have
res
judicata
to
plead?
you
say,
they
acquired
it,
there
was
a
judgment,
it
was
so
many
dollars,
and
that
dollar
judgment
is
it.
it
has
been
satisfied,
end
of
issue.
preclusion
for
that
reason.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
unknown
speaker
but
do
you
say
you
have
that
defense
to
plead
not
only
with
respect
to
the
party
in
whom
title
has
been
adjudicated,
but
that
you
also
have
that
defense
to
plead
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
money
that
could
possibly
be
a
liability
from
the
government
to
the
respondents?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
yes
or
no?
what's
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
look,
justice
ginsburg
asked
you
why
preclusion
isn't
your
answer
if
you
get
to
quiet
title.
i
understood
you
to
say,
well,
the
issue
really
under
the
quiet
title
act
is
not
title.
the
issue
is
damages.
and
my
question
is,
why
isn't
that
also
a
matter
of
preclusion,
because
the
damages
were
the
subject
of
a
prior
settlement
that
was
reduced
to
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
judgment
remains
closed,
i
presume,
because
you
have
won
on
the
first
issue.
unknown
speaker
not
any
more.
you
waived
it
below.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--res
judicata
can
be
waived.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
the
court
of
appeals
was
wrong
in
saying
that
the
independent
action
was
just
really
a
continuation
of
the
earlier
action?
unknown
speaker
yes.
certainly
an
independent
action
is
possible
under
the
rules,
isn't
it,
because
it
says
that--
unknown
speaker
--right
on
that
point,
supposing...
i
know
it's
not
this
case,
but
supposing
there
had
been
allegations
of
fraud
here,
would
there
need
to
be
an
independent
jurisdictional
basis
for
attacking
the
judgment
on
fraud
grounds?
unknown
speaker
but
the
sentence
describing
independent
actions
includes
fraud
as
a
ground
of
relief.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there's
no
pre-kokkonen
law
that
establishes
that?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
kokkonen,
of
course,
wasn't
really
directed
at
this
problem.
unknown
speaker
how
about
that
it
would
undercut
60(b)
entirely
if
you
could
just--
unknown
speaker
--avoid
60(b)
and
say,
here,
we...
because
60(b),
you
don't
have
to
establish
any
independent
jurisdictional
basis.
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--but
then
it's
also
puzzling
why
did
they
use
the
word
fraud
in
subparagraph
(3),
or
clause
(3),
and
also
put
it
in
with
regard
to
independent
actions
if
that's
just
meant
to
duplicate?
that's
what's
puzzling
to
me.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
let's--
unknown
speaker
--that's
what
i
wanted
to
do.
i
want
to
distinguish
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--which
doesn't
involve
that
kind
of
fraud,
with
a
case
that
does
involve
really,
really
bad
fraud
upon
the
court.
unknown
speaker
and
in
that
case--
unknown
speaker
--does
there
have
to
be
an
independent
federal
basis
for
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
it's
in
the
sentence
about
independent
action.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
there's
been
debate
within
the
court
as
to
the
extent
of
our
inherent
power.
some
of
us
are--
unknown
speaker
--why
do
you
think
that?
that
is,
i
don't
understand
the
relation
of
the
first
parts
of
the
rules
to
the
word
independent
action.
my
understanding
is
there
was
a
classical
action
in
equity
called
an
independent
action
in
equity,
and
that
classical
action
which
existed
in
the
nineteenth
century
was
a
way
of
going
to
a
court
of
equity
and
asking
for
relief
from
a
judgment,
and
you
could
get
it.
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
was
a
jurisdictional
problem,
there
was
no
problem,
because
you
went
to
the
same
court
and
they
let
you
in
in
the
same
court
that
you
had
the
original
action
in.
that
seemed
fairly
clear
from
the
commentators.
unknown
speaker
so
i
grant
you,
i
agree
with
you,
i
don't
understand
the
relation
to
that.
on
the
one
hand
you
have
to
say,
bring
it
within
a
year.
that's
what
they
say
in
the
first
part
of
the
rules.
and
then
they
say,
oh,
but
we're
not
interfering
with
an
independent
action
in
equity
and,
of
course,
that
would
gut
the
year
requirement.
unknown
speaker
but
maybe
it
does...
it
does
gut
it.
unknown
speaker
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
could
proceed
against
whatever
party
was
involved
in
the
first
action.
i
thought
the--
unknown
speaker
--didn't
missouri...
what
is
it,
pacific
railroad--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--that...
to
be
sure,
that
speaks
of
citizenship.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
i
thought--
unknown
speaker
--i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
i
didn't
want
to
be
technical
about
it--
unknown
speaker
--and
said
that
the
whole
point
of
these
independent
actions
in
equity
was
to
set
aside
an
initial
judgment
obtained
through
fraud,
so
if
the
sovereign
waived
immunity
as
to
the
first,
they
waived
it
as
to
the
second,
and
moreover,
since
an
action
in
equity,
forget
the
statute
of
limitations
in
the
statutes.
there's
a
question
of
laches
or
something.
unknown
speaker
it's
equitable.
all
right.
now,
i
grant
you--
unknown
speaker
--that
totally
guts
the
first
part.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
says
it
in
the
second
sentence--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
rules.
it
says
it.
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
missouri
pacific
the
second
action
was
brought
as
a
matter...
in
a
matter
of
months,
after
the
original
decision
came
down
from
this
court,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
am
i
supposed
to
do
this?
what
it
says
is,
this
rule
does
not
limit
the
power
of
a
court
to
entertain
an
independent
action
in
equity--
unknown
speaker
--let's
say,
to
relieve
a
party,
so
i'm
supposed
to
imagine
i'm
back
in
the
days
of
yesteryear,
i'm
back
in
the
19th
century.
unknown
speaker
i'm
supposed
to
imagine
that,
and
i'm
supposed
to
imagine
what
would
a
court
have
done
then
in
an
independent
action
in
equity.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
it
seems
to
tell
me
to
do.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but
then
you're
agreeing
with
me
about
how
to
read
it.
now
tell
me...
i'm
now
back,
imagining
i
am
in
the
19th
century,
bringing
an
independent
action
in
equity
without
coram
nobis,
coram
vobis,
whatever
it
is,
and
now
tell
me--
unknown
speaker
--what
the
court
would
then
have
held
in
respect
to
this
independent
action
and
why.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
mr.
wolfson,
if
under
all
those
rules,
coram
nobis
or
the
various
common
law
writs
that
were
available
then,
if
they
could
have
been
brought
without
a
new
basis
of
federal
jurisdiction
you
can't
argue,
i
don't
believe,
that
substituting
a
category
of
independent
action
for
all
of
those
limited
the
court's
jurisdiction,
because
the
rules
are
not
intended
to
change
jurisdiction.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
juris...
you
didn't
need
new
jurisdiction
under
one
of
those
writs,
you
don't
need
it
today
if
this
is
the
substitute
for
that.
unknown
speaker
but
they're
replaced
by--
unknown
speaker
--they
were
replaced
by
rule
60.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
before
you
do,
i'd
just
like
to
fasten
on
something
extraordinary
about
this
case.
you
prevailed
in
the
district
court.
the
fifth
circuit
was
obviously
very
disturbed
by
this
case,
very
angry
almost,
one
might
say,
because
you
got
cut
off
entirely
at
the
end.
you
end
up,
from
being
a
total
winner,
being
a
total
loser,
so
what
is
it
that...
is
it
that
the...
this
spanish
grant
should
have
been...
did
the
court
of
appeals
think
that
it
was
terribly
negligent,
or
maybe
even
deceptive
of
the
united
states
not
to
have
come
forward
earlier
with
this--
unknown
speaker
--you've
mentioned
the
word
tentative.
there
were...
there's
a
54(b)
judgment
entered
here,
and
yet
there
was
a
third
claim
that
seemed
to
me
just
another
reason
for
the
relief
that
was
wanted.
it
seemed
to
me
that
this
was
an
unfinished
case.
unknown
speaker
1
and
2,
but
the...
i
understand--
unknown
speaker
--but
there
were
three...
two
left
standing,
3
and
4,
right?
unknown
speaker
you
said
the...
in
the...
the
first
count
was
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
probably
wrong.
i
thought
you--
unknown
speaker
--so
you're
telling
me
there
was
only
one
count
left
over,
only
one
thing
that
wasn't
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
taylor,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
taylor,
the
district
judge
said
this
was
in
good
faith.
everybody
realized
that
there
was
this
document,
and
that
it
wasn't
found,
and
the
district
judge
said,
i
understand
that,
but
he
is
not
using
the
kind
of
language
that
you
are.
he
said
there
was
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
government.
unknown
speaker
they
just
couldn't
find
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
you
shouldn't
in
adversary
litigation.
i
mean,
every
time
your
opponent
cites
a
case
incorrectly,
or
states
a
fact
incorrectly
and
you
don't
take
them
up
on
it,
this
is
a
basis
for
setting
aside
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
it
here,
if
there
is
no
knowledgeable
fraud
on
the
part
of
the
government?
unknown
speaker
let's
not
say
it's
not
truthful.
it
was
truthful.
it
was
simply
not
correct.
unknown
speaker
he
wasn't...
he
wasn't
misrepresent...
wasn't
intentionally
misrepresenting.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know,
i'm
rather
troubled
by
that.
i'm
not
sure,
in
an
adversary
system,
you
are
entitled
to
assume
that
what
your
opponent
or
your
opponent's
expert
witness
says
is
true,
and
if
it
turns
out
to
be
false,
you
somehow
have
a
60(b)
claim,
or
some
claim
to
set
it
aside
for
fraud.
i
don't
find
your
case
as
sympathetic
as
you
do.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
record
that
supports
you
on
this,
pages
222
to
224
of
the
appendix...
i
mean,
you
said
the
government
said,
at
your
first...
you
know,
at
the
trial,
before
you
settled...
you
know,
you
settled
the
case.
there
were
no
disposals,
no
private
land
claim
disposals
for
petit
bois
island.
is
that
what
you're
relying
on?
unknown
speaker
and
it
says
or
ship
island,
or
for
horn
island.
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
record
are
they
cited
somewhere,
because
i
want
to
look
and
see
what
it
is
that
the
government
said
that
you
said
was
a
misrepresentation.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
quoted
here.
that's
222-24
of
the
record.
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
is.
unknown
speaker
fine.
what
that
seems
to
do
is,
the
pages
before
that,
what
dorasavage
says
is,
he
describes
his
search,
so
a
person
reading
that
would
think,
well,
he's
reached
the
conclusion
on
the
basis
of
the
search
he's
just
described,
so
where's
the
misrepresentation?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
a
person
who
says,
i've
looked
here,
there,
and
the
other
place,
what's
your
conclusion,
well,
my
conclusion
is,
there
are
no
needles
there
in
that
haystack--
unknown
speaker
--and
then
it
later
turns
out...
i
mean,
i'm
representing
on
the
basis
of
that
search
i
didn't
find
the
needle.
i
didn't
lie,
didn't
tell
the
truth.
i
told
the
truth.
i
didn't
find
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
want
you
to
point
me
to
something
that--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
would
you
be
entitled,
many
years
after
a
judgment
in
that
case,
to
bring
an
independent--
--that's
what...
that's
the--
--action
setting
it
aside
on
the
basis
of
that
sort
of
testimony?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
amount...
how
does
that
differentiate
from
other
cases?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
maybe
you
have
to
hire
your
own
expert.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
what
is
the
source
of
authority
to
file
your
independent
action
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
you
say
you
can
come
in
and
reopen
the
original
quiet
title
action?
unknown
speaker
without
any
time
limit
on
doing
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
does
that
do
to
rule
60(b),
which
sets
time
limits,
1
year,
setting
aside
a
judgment
for
fraud?
do
you
think
that
just
falls
by
the
wayside
because
of
your
version
of
an
independent
action?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
agree
that
you
have
to
read
those
provisions
together
so
that
each
one
of
them
make
sense?
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
second
part
simply
swallows
the
first
part,
do
you
think
that
lets
the
first
part
make
sense?
unknown
speaker
i
think
you
could
reconcile
them
if
you
reserve
the
independent
action
for
particularly
egregious
frauds,
of
which
my
reading
of
the
dorasavage
testimony
would
say
yours
is
not
one.
you
would
respond
to
my
statement
by
telling
me
that
there
are
cases
that
show
that
isn't
so,
so
which
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
taylor,
can
an
independent
action
be
brought
in
a
court
other
than
the
one
that
rendered
the
judgment--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
so,
isn't
that
one
big
difference?
unknown
speaker
if
you're
trying
to
find
a
difference
between
the
two,
60(b)
is
what
you
use
to
reopen
a
judgment
in
the
court
that
rendered
it.
the
independent
action,
unless
i'm
wrong
about
this,
but
as
i
recall,
you
could
bring
that
any
place,
not
the...
you're
not
limited
to
the
court
that
rendered
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
so
wouldn't
that
make
sense,
the
difference
between
the
two?
60(b)
you
go
to
the
court
that
entered
the
judgment,
and
if
you
have
60(b),
then
you
can't
end-run
it,
and
60(b)
has
a
time
limit
for
mistake,
inadvertent
surprise,
excusable
neglect...
but
the
independent
action
is
reserved
for,
you
go
to
another
court,
and
that
court
is
not
going
to
be
any
more
giving,
i
assume,
than
60(b)
would
be
for
the
court
that
rendered
the
judgment.
unknown
speaker
i
may
not...
i
may
have
confused
you
in
the
way
i
put
my
question,
but
when
you
were
doing
research
on
this,
you
probably
looked
up
a
lot
of
cases
that
involved
an
independent
action
in
equity--
unknown
speaker
--and
involved
fraud--
unknown
speaker
--or
misrepresentation.
unknown
speaker
now,
did
you
find
a
case
where
an
independent
action
was
permitted
that
involved
a
fraud
or
a
misrepresentation,
let
us
say
as...
i
want
to
say
as
little
or
trivial...
i
don't
mean
to
be
pejorative,
but
as
small
as
the
one
that
seems
to
be
at
issue
here,
but
nonetheless
the
court
said,
i
know
it
was
an
inadvertent
misrepresentation,
i
know
it
was
somebody
who
was
looking
for
a
needle
in
a
haystack,
i
know
it
isn't
much
of
a
fraud,
but
still
you
can
bring
your
independent
action?
did
you
find
a
case
that
you
would
like
me
to
look
at
that
would
help
you
in
that
way?
unknown
speaker
what
was
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
taylor,
on
the
question
of
finding
the
mistake,
you
said
that
your
client
was
kind
of
lulled
into
a
sense
that
there
was
nothing
to
be
done
because
the
united
states
had
made
a
representation
that
there
was
nothing
there,
and
yet
there
came
a
point
in
time
when
you
were
vigorously
pursuing
freedom
of
information
act,
everything
that
you
could.
you
hired
your
own
researcher.
so
why
did
you
shift
from
trusting
the
government
and
saying,
well,
i'll
accept
their
representation,
and
then
you
took
their
money...
you
were
paid,
what,
200,000
some
odd
dollars...
and
then
there
was
a
great
flurry
of
activity,
much
investigation
on
your
part.
so
why...
well,
what
made
you
suddenly
get
into
this
highly
investigative
mode
when
earlier
you
said,
we
relied
on
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
why
was
that
deed,
or...
that
grant,
why
was
that
dispositive?
i
mean,
the
third
circuit
said
not
only
was
it
relevant,
but
it's
so
dispositive
that
we're
going
to
give
your
client
summary
judgment?
the
united
states
didn't
have
any
chance
to
say,
now,
wait
a
minute,
that
deed
doesn't
do
it,
or
that
grant
doesn't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
but
why
was
it
apparent?
i
know
that
professor
baade
provided
this
affidavit,
but
the
government
didn't
have
a
chance
to
question
that.
unknown
speaker
that
was
in
the
district
court
you're
talking
about?
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
court
denied
you
summary
judgment,
and
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
granted
you,
and
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
if
you
say...
the
district
court
said,
if
it
came
to
the
merits,
which
it
didn't
because
the
district
judge
dismissed
it
on
other
grounds,
but
if
it
came
to
the
merits,
we
don't
give
you
summary
judgment,
faced
with
that
same
document,
and
the
fifth
circuit
said,
yes
you
do
get
summary
judgment.
that
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
why
on
the
factual
attack...
suppose...
this
is
a
question
that's
bothering
me
on
the
merits,
which
you
probably
want
to
get
to,
but
i
take
it
someone
in
the
chain
of
title
here,
maybe
your
client,
bought
an
interest
for
about
$35,
and
it
turns
out
to
be
worth,
so
far,
$223,000
to
your
clients,
so
they've
now
gotten
that
money,
i
take
it,
as
a
result
of
the
decree.
now,
the
thing
i
might
be
missing
is,
suppose
i
say
you
win.
suppose
you
win,
and
you
win,
but
you
don't
necessarily
get...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
whether
this
governor
had
authority
to
grant
the
land
to
mrs.
boudreau
or
not.
he
might
have
just
been
an
occupying
force.
so
suppose
you
go
back
to
the
district
court
and
we
now
hear
that
out,
and
it
turns
out
that
the
governor
was
just
an
occupying
governor,
just
what
they
say.
he's
an
occupying
force.
they
didn't
change
the
civil
law.
he
can't
give
any
land
grants
under
french
law
or
whatever,
and
so
you
lose.
well,
wouldn't
your
clients
have
to
give
back
the
$223,000?
are
they
all
now
prepared
to
put
that
at
risk?
unknown
speaker
how
does
this
work?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
you
have
to
give
it
back?
if
it
turns
out...
if
it
turns
out
that
the
governor
in
fact
did
not
have
the
authority
to
give
mrs.
boudreau
the
land,
because
he
was
just
an
occupying
military
force
and
didn't
have
civil
authority
over
land
grants,
why
don't
you
have
to
give
back
the
$223,000
you
already
got
for
this
because
your
client
has
no
interest
in
this
land?
unknown
speaker
so
if
they
had
to
settle
the
litigation,
why
didn't
you
have
to
settle
the
litigation?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
send
it
back
and
you
win,
wouldn't
we
have
to
say,
you
asked
to
reopen
this,
very
well,
it's
reopened?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
you...
is
the
proposition
that
you're
now
stating,
is
that
consistent
with
the
power's
heirs
decision?
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
think
you've
answered
the
question
i
asked
you.
unknown
speaker
which
was,
is
the
proposition
that
you're
now
maintaining
consistent
with
the
power's
heirs
decision?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
therefore
your
alleged
predecessor
in
title
did
not
have
title.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
isn't
the
crucial
point
that
the
issue
is
the
authority
of
the
governor
to
make
the
grant,
and
the
grant
in
power's
and
the
grant
in
this
case
were
made
on
the
same
day?
isn't
that
the
point
on
which
power's
is
controlling?
unknown
speaker
maybe
it
did
have
questionable
evidence--
--but
that--
--but
it's...
i'm
sorry.
go
ahead.
i
was
going
to...
regardless
of
what
its
evidence
was,
its
conclusion
was
that
the
governor
could
not
make
a
grant
on
that
day,
and
that
is
exactly
the
fact
in...
and
the
day
is
the
same
in
your
case,
so
i
assume
that
power's
decided
the
issue
upon
which
your
claim
rests.
unknown
speaker
but
that...
but
the
decision
turned...
or,
at
least,
it
concluded
that
galvez
didn't
have
the
authority
to
make
that
grant,
did
it
not?
unknown
speaker
then
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
you're
maintaining
isn't
consistent
with
the
decision
in
power's
heirs.
unknown
speaker
is
this
something
we
want
to
do
in
a
case
involving
real
property
title,
where
i
think
the
solicitor
general
is
right,
that
there
stare
decisis
is
regarded
as
the
most...
at
its
greatest
peak?
unknown
speaker
but
it
still
undermines
the
principle
to
say
that
this...
it
will
just
have
a
limited
effect
because
other
factors
historically
soon
came
into
play.
i
don't
think
that
really
counsels
in
favor
of
being
more
lenient
with
stare
decisis
here,
because
the
general
proposition
is
that
when
you're
dealing
with
real
property
titles
you
adhere
most
closely
to
it.
unknown
speaker
i
think
not.
your
time
has
expired--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
taylor.
mr.
wolfson,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
it
also
requires
negligence
on
the
part--
unknown
speaker
--the
absence
of
negligence
on
the
part
of
the
moving
party.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
we
have
the
authority
in
this...
based
on
the
issues
that
are
before
us,
to
rule
in
your
favor
based
on
the
fact
that
the
misrepresentation
is
not
sufficient
to
set
aside
the
judgment?
unknown
speaker
your
brief
asks
that
we
remand.
unknown
speaker
was
there
a
ruling
on
laches
on--
unknown
speaker
--the
independent
action?
unknown
speaker
can
you
go
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question?
unknown
speaker
i
was
thinking,
maybe
if
we're
trying
to
reconcile
independent
action
with
the
first
part
of
the
rule,
you
would
do
it
by
saying,
independent
action
of
those
unusual
egregious
frauds,
et
cetera,
but
you
say,
if
i
thought
that
i
couldn't
say
that
here.
we'd
have
to
send
it
back.
unknown
speaker
as
to
whether
it
is
egregious?
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
is...
can
we
take
certain
facts...
i
mean,
they
have
the
record
here.
suppose
we
look
at
their
facts,
which
was
testimony
that
was
referred
to,
and
said
that
doesn't
rise
to
the
level,
or
it
does?
