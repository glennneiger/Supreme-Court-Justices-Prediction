mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1982,
the
united
states
and
about
200
other
parties
settled
complex
land
litigation
by
agreeing
that
the
title
to
the
disputed
lands
would
be
quieted
in
the
united
states
and
that
the
defendants
would
receive
substantial
sums
which
they
stipulated
in
the
consent
judgment
were
fair
and
just
compensation
for
their
claims.
over
a
decade
later,
the
respondents
sought
to
nullify
that
settlement
agreement.
they
contended
that
public
documents
in
the
national
archives
showed
that
the
disputed
lands
on
horn
island
had
been
granted
to
a
private
claimant
by
the
spanish
colonial
authorities
in
1781.
the
district
court
dismissed
their
challenge
to
the
consent
judgment
as
untimely,
and
also
stated
that
there
was
little
evidence
of
fraud
or
mistake
to
support
their
challenge
on
the
merits,
but
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
respondent
that
the
consent
judgment
should
be
set
aside,
and
it
also
held
that
the
spanish
grant
was
valid,
and
it
awarded
title
in
the
disputed
lands
to
the
respondents.
the
court
of
appeals
decision
contravenes
important
values
of
finality,
repose,
and
stability
in
the
law
which
are
at
their
apex
in
litigation
over
titles
to
land,
and
the
lower
court's
errors
also
have
broad
significance
for
the
stability
of
title
to
both
public
and
private
lands.
first,
the
court
of
appeals
disregarded
basic
principles
of
finality
of
judgments
and
sovereign
immunity
when
it
allowed
this
case
to
go
forward.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
they
both...
there
are
two...
i
have
to
turn
to
the
statute
of...
the
qta,
the
quiet
title
act
for
a
minute.
if
we
win
on
the
sovereign
immunity
ground,
then
i
think
that
the
quiet
title
action
can't
really
go
anywhere
because
we
would
indisputedly
have
title
to
the
lands.
that
is,
there
may
be
a
separate
question--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't...
my...
our
position
is
that
the
quiet
title
act
would
not
allow
a...
would
not
allow
the
settlement
to
be
set
aside.
i
mean,
if
the...
let's
assume
that
they
could
get
into
district
court
under
the
quiet
title
act
because
the
court
of
appeals
said
yes,
the
statute
of
limitations
was
tolled.
immediately,
we
would
move
for
summary
judgment
or
to
move
to
dismiss
their
claim
because
it's...
the
judgment
held...
as
a
matter
of
res
judicata
definitively
gave
us
title,
and
in
the
quiet
title
act,
in
fact,
there's
a
provision
that
says
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
set
out
with
particularity
the
nature
of
his
right
title
or
interest
in
the
disputed
lands,
as
well
as
the
united
states,
and
it
would
be,
i
think,
a
complete
defense
to
any
action
under
the
quiet
title
act
that
the
judgment
in
the
prior
action
had
conclusively
found...
determined
that
title
were
in
the
united
states.
now,
that
is...
it
may
be
a
separate
question
from
the
statute
of
limitations
question
under
the
quiet
title
act
as
to--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
mean,
we
of
course...
it
has
to
be
understood
in
the
district
court
the
respondents
relied
on
the
quiet
title
action...
on
the
quiet
title
act
not
really...
they
didn't
really
want
title
to
the
land
back.
they
didn't
really
want
their
land
back.
they
wanted
money,
and
there's
various
pleadings
in
the
district
court
in
which
they
say
that.
what
they
said,
your
honor,
was
that
the
quiet
title
act
allowed
the
district
court
to
award
them
damages
because
there
is
a
provision
that
says
if
it's
found
that
it's
their
land
but...
under
the
quiet
title
act,
but
we
elect
to
keep
it
anyway,
then
we
can
elect
to
award
them
compensation.
our
argument
in
the
district
court
was
that
the
district
court
could
not
use
the
quiet
title
act
on
that
basis
because
it
was
essentially
a
taking
claim
which
had
to
be
brought
in
the
court
of
federal
claims.
now,
we
went
up
to
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
have
to
emphasize
that
the
reason...
the
quiet
title
act
is
in
the
case
only
because,
essentially,
of
a
surprise
that
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that...
well,
i
think
that
if
we
win
on
the
first
question
presented,
then
we
have
those
defenses
to
plead,
but
if
we
lose
on
the
first
question
presented--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
again,
i
think
that
i...
you
know,
we
are
here
on
our
petition
sort
of
taking
the
case
as
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
may
not
be
understanding
your
question
exactly,
but
if
we--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right,
and
my...
i
guess
what
i
have
to
say
is,
it's
an
answer
that
we
can
give
only
if
that
judgment
remains
closed.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
if
we
win
on
the
first
issue,
then
i
think
we
have
a
substantive
defense,
but
on
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
no.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't...
i
have
to
say
i
don't
think
we
waived
it.
i
mean,
it
wasn't
really
presented
in
a
way
in
which
we
were
called
upon
to
address
it
in
the
district
court.
the
respondents
did
not
even
amend
their
cause
of...
amend
their
complaint
in
order
to
raise
a
claim
under
the
quiet
title
act
until
after
they
filed
for
summary
judgment,
and
the
district
court
dismissed
it
as
untimely,
which
should
be
reviewed
in
the
court
of
appeals,
i
would
think,
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
so
we
strongly
feel
that
we
had
no
call
to
even
address
these
matters.
it
was
only
when
the
court
of
appeals,
even
while
excusing
the
respondents
for
their
12-year
delay
in
bringing
their
suit,
rushed
to
the,
you
know,
ultimate
merits
of
the
case,
reopened
the
judgment,
concluded
that
everything...
that
the
land
claim
was
valid,
and
awarded
title
to
the
respondents,
that
we
had
to
face
the
issue
about
whether
the
quiet
title
act
could
be
a
basis
for
awarding
the
title
into
the
respondents'
land.
i
think
that
that
does
focus...
return
me
to
my
point
about
why
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions...
why
its
rulings
are
so
important.
first,
i
mean,
in
terms
of
finality
of
judgments
and
sovereign
immunity,
the
court
of
appeals
essentially
redetermined
land
title
issues
in
a
litigation
against
the
united
states
that
was
a
collateral
attack
on
a
final
judgment
where
there
was
no
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
that
would
permit
such
a
case
to
go
forward.
second,
when
the
court
of
appeals,
on
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
tolling
of
the
statute
of
limitations
under
the
quiet
title
act,
when
the
court
held
that
it
should
be
tolled,
i
think
it
disregarded
two
very
important
policies
about
statute
of
limitations,
both
generally
in
the
law
and
especially
with
regard
to
land
title
litigation:
first,
protecting
parties
against
being
forced
to
come
into
court
to
defend
against
stale,
very
stale
land
claims,
and
also
to
encourage
plaintiffs
who
claim
an
interest
in
land
to
conduct
prompt
and
thorough
research
on
their
claims.
i've
spoken
third
about
the
court
of
appeals
kind
of
prematurely
judging
the
merits
of
the
case.
that,
we
submit,
was
error
because
it
was...
first
of
all
because
it
was
outside
of
the
scope
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
it
is.
i
think
that's...
that
is
essentially
our
primary
submission.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
i
mean,
i
would
say
this.
the
rules
leave
any
independent
action
where
they
found
it.
that
is,
they
do
not...
the
rules,
of
course,
do
not
abridge
or
modify
or
enlarge
any
substantive
right,
and
all
that...
when
rule
60(b)
says
there
may
be
an
independent
action,
it
doesn't
purport
to
create
one,
or
establish
what
the
substantive
law
would
be
for
proceeding
under
one.
all
it
says
is,
if,
under
some
other
body
of
substantive
law
there
is
available
to
a
party
an
independent
action
that
would
allow
that
party
relief
from
a
final
judgment,
the
rules
leave
that
where...
you
know,
leave
that
there.
what
the
rules
themselves
do,
however,
is
they
eliminated
a
kind
of
a
borderland
of
ancillary
forms
of
action
that
were
neither
really
inside
nor
exactly
outside
the
original
litigation,
that
were
available
in
the
19th
century,
before
law
and
equity
were
united
in
the
federal
rules
in
1938
and,
as
we've
explained,
there
was
considerable
confusion
between
1938
and
1946
as
to
whether
still
one
could
go
outside
the
mechanism
that
the
rules
had
set
up,
which
was
to
say,
to
file
a
motion
for
relief
from
judgment.
the
reason
why
i
think
there
was
confusion
was
that
as
it
was
originally
enacted,
rule
60(b)
did
not
specifically
say
that
a
party
could
get
relief
from
a
final
judgment
because
of
fraud,
and
i
think
there
was
some
speculation
that
it
couldn't
have
been
that
the
rules
had
intended
to
cut
off
that
avenue
from
relief.
what
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
because
they're
outside
the
time
limit
of
rule
60(b),
which
is
1
year
for
seeking
relief
from
a
final
judgment
based
on
fraud,
whether
intrinsic
or
extrinsic,
as
the
rule
specifically
says,
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
there
may
be...
there
may
be
some
substantive
law...
for
example,
between
private
parties
is
one
that
would
come
to
mind,
where
one
party
could
seek
to...
could
bring
a
lawsuit
in
federal
district
court
against
another
and
get
relief
from
a
final
judgment
based
on
fraud,
but
when
such
an
independent
action
is
filed
in
federal
district
court,
it
is
just
like
any
new
lawsuit.
you
need
substantive
law.
you
need
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
you
need...
and...
when
the
lawsuit
is
against
the
united
states.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
what
is
our
authority
for
that?
well,
i
think...
i
mean,
we're
drawing
our
reasoning
from
the
court's
recent
decision
in
kokkonen.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i
mean,
we
recognize--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
acknowledge
that.
i
mean,
we...
i
guess
our...
we
recognize
that
this
has
been
an
unsettled
issue
for
a
while.
i
mean--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that's
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
it
is
truly
ancillary
jurisdiction--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--and
i
think
it
would
be
hard
to
understand
why
the
drafters
of
the
federal
rules
would
have
put
in
a
1-year
time
limit
for
relief
from
judgment,
motions
for
relief
from
judgment
based
on
fraud,
among
other
things,
and
mistake,
if
it
had...
were
also
possible
just
to
file
a
new
or
an
independent
action
without
invoking
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that...
well,
there
is...
i
mean,
i
do
have
to...
i
do
want
to
say,
there
is
a
separate
concept
of
fraud
upon
the
court.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right,
and
that...
that
is
really,
really
bad
fraud.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
mean,
there's
no
other
way
to--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
what--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think
that
case...
that
case
does
not
really
involve
an
independent
action
at
all.
what
that
case--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
it
says...
but
you
see,
it
says,
it
does
not
relieve
a...
it
does
not
prevent
a
party
from
bringing
an
independent
action
or
to
set
aside
a
judgment
for
fraud
upon
the
court.
now,
that...
the
ability
of
a
court
to
sort
of
purge
itself
of
the
effects
of
fraud
perpetrated
upon
it...
the
classic
example
was
this
court's
opinion
in
hazel-atlas.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that
is
an
inherent
authority
of
the
court.
it
doesn't
even
require
an
independent
action.
in
fact,
there
are
cases
from
this
court
where
a
party
brought
allegations
of
fraud
to
the
court
as
amicus
curiae.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
i
think
that
this
is
a...
it
doesn't
even...
as
i
understand
the
cases
under
this,
to
be...
for
a
court
to
purge
itself
of
a
fraud
upon
the
court,
it
doesn't
even
really
require
a
new
lawsuit.
it
is
ability
of
one
branch
of
government
to
protect
itself
from
fraud
perpetrated
upon
it,
but
it
is
a
unique
and
very,
very
narrow
situation
that
involves
egregious
misconduct
like
bribing
a
juror.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well...
all
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
mean,
first...
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
first
of
all
let
me
say,
although
there
were
these
independent
actions
in
equity,
they
were
not
allowed
to
proceed
against
the
sovereign
under
cases
that
we've
cited
in
our
brief.
they're
all--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
all--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--missouri
pacific
rail--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
that
is...
i
would
acknowledge
that
that
is
the
strongest
case
for
the
other
side,
but
that's
not--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
that's
not
a
case
against
the
sovereign,
and
the
cases
that
we've
cited
on
page
20,
footnote
13
of
our
brief,
hill
v.
united
states,
united
states
v.
mclemore,
they
all
say,
well,
these
bills
of...
these
things
like
bills
of
review,
they
are
really...
they
are
really
new...
as
far
as
sovereign
immunity
is
concerned,
they
are
new
actions.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
want
to
emphasize
that
before
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
there
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
there
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
think
that
if...
looking
at
those
cases,
they
really...
although
they
are
referred
to
as
independent
actions
in
equity
they
really
are
devices
that
courts
of
equity
were
trying
to
fashion
in
order
to
get
around
the
problem
that
a
court
of
law
could
not
reopen
its
judgments
after
a
few
months,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right,
and
that's...
and
in
missouri
pacific
there
had
been
a
problem
because
there
was
no
longer
complete
diversity
among
the
parties,
and
the
court
said...
now...
said
yes,
you
know,
the
parties
can
go
forward.
we
think
that
missouri
pacific
is
really
best
understood
as
a
fraud
upon
the
court
case,
but
if
not,
then
it
probably
is
best
understood
as
a
bill
of
review
case,
where
it
was
a...
sort
of
a
supplemental
bill.
it
wasn't
really...
it
wasn't
an
independent
action
in
equity
like
somebody--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
all
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
the
bill...
all
right,
but
the
rule--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
the
rule
also
says,
and
i
think
this
is
very
important,
writs
of
coram
nobis,
coram
vobis,
ad
ide
corella,
bills
of
review
and
bills
in
the
nature
of
bills
of
review,
are
abolished,
so
i
think
first
of
all
you
have
to
make
sure
that
it
isn't
anything
like
those,
and
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
it
says,
you
know,
we
have
endeavored
to
list
every
single
form
of
ancillary
form
of--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i'm
not
sure...
i'm
not
sure...
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you
that
we
are
back
in
the
19th
century.
i
think
that
in...
when
the
court
is
using
the
term,
independent
action,
it
means
a
new
lawsuit,
but
even
if
we're
back
in
the
19th
century,
i
mean,
what
i
think
we
were
talking
about
is,
if
there
is
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
all
of
the
rest
of
it
and
you
can
go
and
bring
a
new
lawsuit...
for
example,
parties
with
diversity
of
citizenship
who
go
into
federal
court
to
enjoin
the
effect
of
a
state
court
judgment,
that
is
a
classic
independent
action
in
equity,
but
it
would
need
all
of
the
requisites
of
what
anybody
would
need
when
they
were
filing
a
new
case
in
federal
court.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
and
i
think
it's
not.
i
mean,
i
think
the
point
is
that...
i
mean,
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question,
but
all
of
those
are
abolished,
and
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--they're
not...
i
don't
think
they
are
replaced
by
an
independent
action.
what
they
are
replaced
by--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--was
rule
60(b)...
right,
and
so
i
would
say
that
the
only
way...
what
rule
60(b)
is
intended
to
make
clear
is
that
the
only
way
you
can
get
relief
from
final
judgment
without
filing
a
new
lawsuit
is
to
make
a
motion
under
the
rules,
and
the
advisory
committee
notes
say
the
rules,
the
practice
of
the
rules
are
intended
to
be
complete
in
this
regard.
i'd
like
to
turn,
if
i
may,
to
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i...
obviously
it's
difficult
to...
i
mean,
i
agree
with
you
that
the
court
of
appeals
was...
you
know,
there
was
something
that
really
concerned
it
about
the
case,
but
i
have
to
say,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
of
appeals
might
have
thought
there
was
some
problem
that
led
it
to
toll...
thought...
think
that
equitable
tolling,
for
example,
was
proper,
i
have
to
say
i
disagree
with
it.
i
mean,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
we
did
bring
the
fact
of
the
boudreau
grant
to
the
parties'
attention
in
the
original
litigation
and
said,
presuming
this
to
be
for...
a
grant
for
horn
island,
we...
you
know,
we
believe
that
it
was
not
valid
because
it
was
never
recognized
by
commissioner
crawford
and
so
it
shouldn't
be
given
effect.
on
the
point
about
power's
heirs,
which
i
want
to
get
to,
the
court...
the
respondents
did
not
mention
power's
heirs
either
in
the
lower
court,
and
professor
baade's
affidavit,
which
purports
to
be
a
comprehensive
examination
of
this
court's
19th
century
decisions
on
the
issue,
does
not
address...
you
know,
does
not
discuss
power's
heirs
at
all,
even
though
it
is
a...
it
is
a
controlling
decision
of
federal
law
that
goes
to
the
ultimate
issue
on
the
merits
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
the
united
states
obtained
title
to
the
lands
in
the
louisiana
purchase
or
whether
they
were...
had
already
been
alienated
out
of
the
public
domain
at
that
time.
now,
two
points
on
how
the
court
of
appeals
disposed
on
the
case.
first,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
acted
outside
the
scope
of
appellate
jurisdiction
under
section
1291
when
it
reached
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case.
even
if
we're
wrong
on
the
first
two
questions
presented,
or
even
the
first
one,
and
even
if
the
judgment
of
dismissal
was
incorrect
in
the
case...
you
know,
that
dismissal
should
have
been
reversed...
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
should
have
done
was
simply
remand
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
the
district
court
did
not
really
look
at
any
of
the
merits
issues
in
this
case.
i
mean,
it
thought
that
that
had
already
been
decided
already,
and
all
the
district
court
really
said
about
the
case
was,
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
respondents
have
brought
forth
evidence
of
fraud
or
mistake
that
would
justify
setting
aside
the
judgment
even
in
the
alternative,
and
on
that
basis
it
denied
the
respondents'
motion
for
summary
judgment.
now,
that
denial
of
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
was
not
a
final
decision.
it
certainly
wouldn't
have
been
appealable
by
itself,
and
it
didn't
merge...
the
courts
often
talk
about
an
interlocutory
decision
merging
into
the
final
judgment,
and
i
would
submit
that
it
did
not
merge
into
the
final
judgment
because
it
did
not
in
any
way
affect
the
ultimate
way
in
which
the
district
court
disposed
of
the
case,
which
was
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
so
when
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
dismissal
and
said
the
case
can
go
forward,
the
case
was
essentially
just
where
it
had
been
in
the
district
court,
which
was
a
tentative
conclusion
that
the
case
should
not...
should
go
to
trial.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the...
well,
the
district
court
dismissed
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
third...
there
was
a
third
that
was
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
that's
the
tucker...
that's
the...
they
raised
sort
of
an
inverse
condemnation
claim,
and
the
district
court
said
on
that,
no--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--there's
only
three...
i
believe
there's
only
three
causes
of
action
in
the
complaint.
one
is
fraud,
one
is
mutual
mistake,
and
the
third
is
inverse
condemnation.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
was
dismissed
for...
because
of...
yes.
it's
in
the
district
court's
order
in
the
petition
appendix
at--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes,
it's
at
page
42a
and
43a
of
the
petition
appendix,
because
the
court
said,
well,
even
if
there
is
a...
some
claim
of
taking
here,
it
has
to
be
presented
to
the
court
of
federal
claims.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no,
everything
was
decided
by
the
district
court.
i
would...
i
mean,
the
district
court
dismissed
all
three
causes
of
action,
two
for
untimeliness,
and
the
third
because
it
belonged
in
the
court
of
federal
claims,
so
it's
a
whole...
it's
not
a
54(b)
judgment.
it's
a...
it
was
a
final
judgment
of
dismissal.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
turning
last
to
the
court
of
appeals
decision
on
the
merits,
the
respondents
have
argued
that
this
court
decided
power's
heirs
on
the
basis
of
an
incorrect
and
incomplete
understanding
of
the
history
of
west
florida,
and
we
disagree
with
their
reading
of
that
history,
but
we
would
say
that
even
if
the
question
is
doubtful,
that
the
court
should
nonetheless
adhere
to
its
decision
in
power's
heirs,
which
was
a
controlling
decision
of
federal
law
about
the
interests
of
the
united
states
obtained
under
the
louisiana
purchase.
that
decision
governs
both
private
and...
both
public
and
possibly
private
land
claims
in
the
area,
and
it
would
be...
the
policy
of
stare
decisis
has
its
strongest
force,
this
court
has
recognized
several
times,
in
the
area
of
litigation
over
titles
to
land.
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
the
court
to
overrule
a
150-year-old
precedent
governing
land
titles
without
a
truly
compelling
reason,
and
for
that
reason
we
think
the
court
should
adhere
to
that
decision.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
points.
first,
on
the
question
of
mistake
on
the
west
virginia
oil
&
gas
decision
that
my
colleague
mentioned,
first
of
all
let
me
say
we
think
that
case
was
incorrectly
decided.
it's
an
old
fifth
circuit
case.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--on
the
facts--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
on
the...
well...
on
the
facts
of
this...
i
think
that
if...
assume
we're
wrong
on
the
first
two
questions
presented
and
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court,
i
think
that
the
case
has
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
a
determination
about
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
the...
once
the
dismissal
based
on
lack
of
jurisdiction
would
be
wiped
out,
then
the
case
is
no
longer
really
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
case
should
go
back
to
the
district
court
for
further
proceedings.
there--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
there
was,
your
honor.
the
district
court
concluded
that
the
respondents'
independent...
it
recognized
that
there
was
a
bar
of...
there
could
be
a
bar
of
laches,
and
it
ruled
that
respondents'
independent
action
was
barred
by
laches.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
just
didn't
really
address
that
at
all,
and
nonetheless,
you
know,
held
for
the
respondents.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
as
to
whether
it
is
egregious,
and
because
the...
it's
the
district
court
that
is
supposed
to...
it's
the
district
court
that's
supposed
to
make
an
evaluation,
and
then
when
it
looked
at
the
case
it
said,
you
know,
i
don't
find
any
evidence
here
of
fraud
or
mistake
that
would
warrant
setting
aside
the
judgment.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
of
course,
we...
i
mean,
i
think
if
it
went
back
to
the
district
court,
we
would
move
for
summary
judgment,
probably,
on
the
grounds
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
fraud
or
mistake
on...
and
so
on
the
merits
the
independent
action
should
not
go
forward.
i
think
the
court...
once...
all
that
the
court
of
appeals
could
have
done
was
decide
whether
there
was
jurisdiction.
a
couple
of
points
about
the
national
archives.
i
can't
agree
with
the
statement
that
the
government
directed
the
respondents
away
from
the
national
archives.
i
understand
that
my
colleague
has
relied
on
dr.
dorasavage's
deposition,
but
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
whole
of
that
deposition
and
also
mr.
knipfing's
deposition
did
say
that
the
crawford
commission
report
is
one
standard
source
that
we
look
to
and
it
is
in
the
national
archives,
and
we
did
bring
the
boudreau
grant
specifically
to
the
attention
of
the
court.
thank
you.
