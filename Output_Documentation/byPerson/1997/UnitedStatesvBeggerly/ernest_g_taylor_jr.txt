mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
begin
immediately
by
stating
that
counsel
opposite's
comment
that
the
finality
of
judgments
is
important
to
protect
litigants
from
stale
claims
and
to
also
encourage
litigants
to
do
their
research
before
presenting
their
cases,
or
during
the
cases,
is
a
critical
point
that
is
in
my
favor,
because
the
federal
government
in
this
instance
did
not
do
their
research,
and
they
misrepresented
a
critical
fact.
they
misrepresented
that
the
key
document
that
the
beggerlys
needed
to
defend
their
claim
in
1979
did
not
exist,
and
i
don't
think
there's
really
any
question
on
this
record
but
that
that
misrepresentation
is
the
cause
of
the
entry
of
this
judgment.
it
also
was
the
cause
of
delay,
which
i'll
get
into
in
a
little
bit--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
did
not--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--excuse
me.
pardon
me,
your
honor.
i
did
not
intend
to
insinuate
that
the
government
did
not
act
in
good
faith.
you
can
act
in
good
faith
and
not
get
your
homework
done.
you
can
act
in
good
faith
and
not
do
a
thorough
job.
i'm
not
saying
that
the
government
intended
to
not
find
this
document,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
they
did
not
find
it,
and
they
represented
that
it
did
not
exist,
and
our
people
relied
upon
that
representation.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
certainly
not,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
what
happened
here,
in
my
mind,
is
similar
to
what
happens
in
discovery
in
all
cases.
after
doing
an
initial
investigation
of
their
own
in
various
archives,
including
the
national
archives,
the
beggerlys
ultimately
deposed
mr.
dorasavage,
who
was
the
ultimate
authority
on
these
records
and
these
grants.
mr.
dorasavage
said
that
the
document
did
not
exist.
there
was
still
time
to
look
further...
not
much,
but
still
some
time,
when
he
gave
that
testimony
in
1982.
the
beggerlys,
just
like
any
litigant
does
when
they
take
a
30(b)(6)
deposition,
or
take
a
deposition
of
a
managing
agent,
they're
entitled
to
assume
that
the
testimony
that
is
given
on
behalf
of
the
other
litigant
is
truthful,
and
until
some
time...
until
such
time
that
they
acquire
evidence
to...
that
indicates
that
it's
not
true,
then
they
don't
look
in
that
area
any
more.
they
accept--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
i
apologize,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
right.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
independent
action,
according
to
the
basis
for
that
action,
identified
in
banker's
mortgage
company
case,
fifth
circuit
case,
1970,
specified
that
mistake
or
fraud
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
setting
aside
a
judgment,
and
that
has
been
the
generally
accepted
rule,
that
you
do
not
have
to
prove
fraud,
that
mistake
is
sufficient,
and--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
you've
got
the
wrong
island,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
right.
they...
there
were
a
combination
of
representations,
those
made
during
the
summary
judgment
proceedings
and
the
sworn
testimony
of
mr.
dorasavage.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
we
have
cited
in
our
brief
mr.
dorasavage's
testimony.
i
don't
have
that--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--all
right,
sir.
if
that's
dorasavage's
testimony--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--it's
that
representation
that
they
did
rely
upon.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
well,
the
misrepresentation
is
that
there
and
in
the
briefs
the
government
indicated
the
grant
didn't
exist
when
in
fact
it
did
exist.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
if
i--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--again,
your
honor,
in
the
discovery
process,
and
i
don't...
am
certainly
not
arguing
with
the
court
in
any
way,
but
i--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
the
30(b)(6)
depositions
that
we
take
every
day
in
litigation,
if
i
take
a
company
representative
and
he
says,
we
don't
have
any
documents
of
this
description,
and
i
have
done
the
research
i'm
supposed
to
do,
then
i
am
entitled
to
go
and
conduct
my
search
in
other
places
and
in
other
ways
and
to
rely
on
that
statement
and--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--it
would
depend
upon
the
gravity
of
the
representation
i
think,
your
honor,
and
also
the...
in
this
case
i
might
add
that
you
have
individuals
against
the
united
states
government,
and
you
have
the--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--we
get
to
sophistication,
your
honor,
not
just
of
the
parties...
i
know
that
a
litigant
has
the
responsibility
to
do
what's
necessary
to
present
his
claim,
but
when
you're
dealing
with
specialized
documents
that
are
kept
in
special
places
that
even
only
a
handful
of
experts,
probably,
in
the
country
know
how
to
thoroughly
research,
i
do
think
that
makes
a
difference.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
and
we
did,
and
they
came
to
the
archives
and
did
a
search,
as
the
government
did,
without
finding
it.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
the...
two
sources
of
authority,
your
honor.
one
is
ancillary
jurisdiction
to
reopen
their
initial
action,
as
was
discussed
previously.
the
pacific
railroad...
railway--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
the
limitation
that's
applicable
to
an
independent
action
in
equity
is
laches.
laches
says
that
as
long
as
a
party
is
diligent
in
pursuing
his
rights
and
there's
no
prejudice
to
the
other
party
in
later
litigating
the
issue
because
of
the
delay,
then
they
will
not
be
stopped
by
laches.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
i
think
that
there
is...
the
very
rule
itself
having
listed
those
items
in
the
first
part
of
60(b)
that
must
be
brought
within
a
year
and
then
saying,
but
this
does
not
prevent
someone
from
bringing
an
independent
action,
adopts
the
independent
action
as
it
existed
so
far
as--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--of
course,
your
honor,
they
do
have
to
make
sense.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
i
disagree
with
your
premise,
your
honor,
that
it
swallows
the
first
part.
i
believe
in
order
to
bring
an
independent
action
you've
got
to
show
the
five
elements
to
bring
an
independent
action
that
are
listed
in
the
banker's
mortgage
case,
and
that
there
are
more
stringent
requirements
for
bringing
an
independent
action
after
the
year
has
run
than
are
required
for
bringing
the
other
60(b)
motion
within
a
year.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
i
can't
specify
a
particular
case
that
provides
for
that,
but
i
do
think
that--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--i...
may
i
conclude
my
answer
here--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--i
believe
i
have
concluded
that,
justice
breyer
is...
yes.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
curious
to
me
that
you
can
go
either
to
a
separate
court
or
into
the
court
that
rendered
the
action,
and
i
frankly
do
not
understand
why
you
may
go
into
a
circuit
court
as
well
as
an
original
court.
presumably
the
original
court
is
available,
and
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
and
that
is
that
there
is
a
distinction,
because
you
can
go
into
a
separate
court
there,
rather
than
filing...
and
filing
a
motion,
you
cannot.
but
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
provisions
for
an
independent
action
here
preserve
those
equitable
grounds
that
existed
in
the
19th
century,
which
was
to
give
the
court
discretion
to
have
some
flexibility
in
setting
aside
a
judgment
when
a
wrong
has
been
done,
the
party
has
been
diligent
that
presented
it,
and
that
to
weigh
those
equities
and
to
make
an
adjustment,
as
all
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
preserved,
as
i
understand
it,
those
19th
century
and
prior
rights
that
litigants
had.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
right.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
west
virginia
oil
&
gas
v.
breece
lumber
company,
cited
in
our
brief.
it's
a
fifth
circuit
1954
decision.
it's
also
cited
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
its
opinion.
that
case
is
one
in
which
there
was
a
mistake
in
regards
to
a
description
of
land,
and
it
became
apparent
that
there
was
a
mistake,
but
oil
and
gas
had
been
discovered
on
the
land
in
the
meantime.
the
party
that
was
a
beneficiary
didn't
want
to
agree
to
it
and
fought
it
on
jurisdictional
grounds.
as
i
recall,
that
action
was
brought
7
years
after
the
original
judgment
was
entered,
and
it
was
pure
mistake,
and
the
court
reversed
it
and
corrected
that
mistake.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
the
intensity
of
the
investigation
slowed
down
some
after
the
judgment
was
entered
but
did
increase
again,
or
did
recontinue
afterwards.
the
critical
point,
i
believe,
so
far
as
the
inability
to
bring
this
action
within
1
year,
is
that
the
beggerlys
had
looked
at
archives
all
around,
had
hired
an
archivist
to
look,
had
looked
in
the
national
archives,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
had
not
discovered
the
grant.
as
they
got
to
the
very
end,
after
they'd
done
this
basic
research,
and
they
took
the
deposition
of
the
government
representative,
a
man
who
supposedly
knows
how
to
find
documents
in
the
national
archives
and
other
repositories.
he
said
there
is
no
grant
in
the
national
archives,
and
they
had
already
done
an
initial
look,
and
so
they
accepted
him.
they
pursued
freedom
of
information
act
requests
after
the
judgment
was
entered.
they
pursued
other
means
to
try
to
find
this,
but
they
didn't
go
back
to
the
national
archives
for
some
time,
and
the
reason
they
did
not
go
back
there
is
because...
based
on
this
representation
that
it
would
be
fruitless.
finally,
as
a
last-ditch
effort,
they
said
okay,
let's
take
one
more
look,
and
they
hired
this
genealogist
who
went
in
and
did
intensive
research
over
a
period
of
several
weeks
and
found
the
document.
but
they
were
directed
away
from
the
national
archives
as
it
got
to
the
close
of
the
litigation
because
of
the
government's
representation,
because
they
had
already
deposed
the
deputy
of
that
office,
who
said
there
may
be
grants
there.
they
went
in
and
did
their
own
research
and
they
deposed
the
ultimate
authority,
and
he
said
you
won't
find
them
there,
and
so
they
ceased
looking
there
until
they
had
looked
in
all
the
other
places
possible.
and
then
they
went
back
and
said,
okay,
let's
take
one
last
look
here
and
see
if
we
can
find
it,
and
they
did.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
well,
the
point
is
the
government
had
tried
to
buy
the
beggerly
property
for
several
years,
and
negotiated
with
them
and
made
offers
to
buy
it,
fully
recognized
their
title,
with
the
exception
of
their
ultimate
determination
that
there
was
not
a
valid
disposal
out
of
the
federal
government.
there
wasn't
a
valid
patent
or
grant.
that
was
the
only
question,
and
once
they
found
the
boudreau
grant
and
it
was
apparent
that
it
was
a
valid
and
binding
grant
on
the
record
before
the
court--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--the
government
did
have
an
opportunity
to
question
that,
your
honor.
they
had
opportunity
in
response
to
our
summary
judgment
affidavit
to
challenge
it.
they
elected
not
to
challenge
it.
they
elected
to
attack
it
purely
on
legal
grounds,
saying
that--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
and
of
course
the
same
thing
in
the
fifth
circuit,
and
i
might
add,
the
attack
that's
brought
concerning
galvez'
authority
was
brought
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
something
we
objected
to.
the
citation
of
the
power's
heirs
case
in
that
regard
was
brought
for
the
first
time
in
this
court,
and
let
me
deal
with
that,
if
i
may,
right
here.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
because
the
issues
that
were
presented
to
the
district
court
and
to
the
fifth
circuit
were
purely
legal
issues.
the
government
defended
on
the
ground
of
jurisdiction.
it
defended
on
the
grounds
of
res
judicata.
it
attacked
the
judgment
on
legal
grounds,
whether
or
not
it
was
valid
because
it
had
not
been
confirmed,
and
for
that
reason
the
record
that
was
before
the
court
did
not
indicate
that
the
government
has
any
interest
or
any
intention
to
pursue
any
factual
attack
here,
and--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--that's
an
issue
that
could...
would
have
to
be
dealt
with
in
the
district
court,
as
to
the
nature
of
that
payment
and
why
it
was
paid
and
what--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--the
government
paid
that
money...
and
this
is
documented
by
the
letter
of
steve
herman,
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
in
order
to
settle
the
litigation.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
and
they
made
the
choice
not
to...
they
made
the
representation
that
they
were
doing
this
for
the
purpose
of
resolving
the
litigation
and
not...
i'm
avoiding
your
question.
i
don't
mean
to.
i'm
going
around
the
world
to
get
there,
your
honor.
the
point
is,
certainly
the
government
would
have
the
right
to
present
their
claim
in
the
litigation.
for
whatever
reason,
they
chose
not
to
do
so
up
to
this
point.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
if
we...
i
think
that
would
be
an
issue
the
district
court
could
take
up,
is
whether
or
not
they
had
the
right
to
pursue
repayment
of
that
money,
yes,
sir.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
address
power's
heirs.
that's
the
case
the
government
says
controls
the
validity
of
the
boudreau
grant,
and
there's
a
point
that
is
raised
in
the
brief
that
i
think
is
controlling
that
says
that
in
1783...
the
government,
dr.
baade,
all
of
us
agreed
in
1783
a
peace
treaty
was
made
between
britain
and
spain.
that
resolved
all
the
issues
between
those
two
warring
nations
at
that
time
as
to
this
land.
that
treaty,
by
principles
of
international
law,
and
this
is
not
disputed
by
counsel
opposite,
validated
all
prior
actions
that
had
been
done
by
the
spanish
government
during
the
time
period
of
occupation.
because
of
that,
whatever,
whoever
may
be
right
about
the
historic
facts
and
when
galvez
was
given
authority,
clearly
under
principles
of
international
law
the
validation
that
occurred
by
virtue
of
that
treaty
resolved
any
issues
there.
the
grant
was
valid.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
the
power's
heirs
decision
did
not
reach
that
issue
of
law,
your
honor.
it
said
first
that
we've
got
questionable
evidence
that's
been
presented
to
us,
and
that
it's
not--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
think
it
is
consistent
with
the
power's
heirs
decision.
this...
if
i
may--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--the
other
point
is,
it's
a
point
that
was
not
presented
in
the
power's
heirs
case.
this
legal
issue
was
not
presented
as
to
the
effect
of
the
treaty.
the
controlling
point,
as
i
read
power's
heirs,
your
honor,
is
that
the
documentation
that
was
presented
to
the
court
was
incomplete.
it
was
from
a
secondary
and
questionable
source,
and
the
court
questioned
whether
or
not
it
had
authentic,
genuine
evidence
before
it.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
well,
but
this
was
power's
heirs,
and
that's
a
different
document
from
the
document
we're
dealing
with,
your
honor.
that
document
was
a
separate
notarial
record
of
a
different
grant
that
had
been
made
as
to
different
islands.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
they...
the
grants
were
made
on
the
same
day,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
a
reading
of
the
power's
heirs
case
indicates
that
the
court
had
questionable
evidence
before
it
as
to
whether
or
not
there
even
was
a
grant--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--well,
the
court
did
say
that
galvez
did
not
have
authority
to
make
that
grant
on
that
day.
we
say
that
the
court
on
the
record
very
clearly
says
that
we
suppose
and
we
presume,
and
used
speculative
language
about
what
the
history
was
to
reach
that
conclusion.
i
believe,
though,
that
the
court
was
driven
by
the
fact
that
it
had
questionable
documentation
before
it.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
it
stated
that
in
the
opinion,
your
honor,
no
question
about
that.
that
was
stated.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
arguably
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
you
can
distinguish
it
in
this
manner,
that
there
were
other...
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
--i
do
not
believe
that
this...
the
court's
affirmance
of
the
fifth
circuit
ruling
and
therefore
finding
the
validity
of
the
boudreau
grant
would
do
violence
to
titles,
and
the
reason
is,
your
honor,
that
this...
we're
talking
about
a
period
in
the
late
18th
century
and
the
government
raises
a
specter
that
we'll
have
competing
titles
out
there
and
that
the
government
may
have
titles
based
upon
the
louisiana
purchase
and
authority
it
gained,
which
is
in
conflict
with
the
spanish
titles.
that's
not
so,
your
honor,
because
adverse
possession
will
have
long
since
taken
care
of
any
issues.
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
i
understand
that
rule
of
law,
your
honor,
and
i
understand
the
reason
behind
it,
but
i...
my
statement
is,
it
is
a
matter
of
fact
there
will
not
be
any
conflict
with
any
titles
caused
by
ruling
that
the
boudreau
grant
was
a
valid
grant,
because
adverse
possession,
whether
it's
the
government's
title,
and
you've
got
a
national
forest,
or
museum,
or
whatever
it
may
have
on
the
land,
adverse
possession
will
clear
up
any
problems
with
that,
and
if
there's
conflicting,
theoretically
conflicting
private
titles,
adverse
possession
again
would
clean
those
up.
clearly,
the
beggerlys'
title
itself,
they
paid
taxes
for
32
years
on
this
land,
and
in
fact
paid
quite
a
bit
more
money
than
that
initial
tax
payment,
because
the
tax
bills
were
going
up
over
time.
nobody
was
claiming
against
them.
the
government
recognized
their
title
itself
and
negotiated
with
them
for
several
years
and
made
offers
to
them
to
buy
it.
even
in
the
raleigh
beggerly
affidavit,
the
government
presented
him
with
title
opinions.
it
said
that
the
title
was
in
the
beggerlys.
so
i
do
not
see
any
disruption
of
title,
and
i
might
add,
your
honor,
that
this
court
has
on
more
than
one
occasion
reconsidered
its
interpretation
of
laws
of
foreign
governments
as
well
as
state
governments
based
on
newly
discovered
evidence
or
the
fact
that
the
law
in
that
sovereign
area,
country,
has
changed
by
a
ruling
of
its
ultimate
authorities.
i
might
add
that
chief
justice
marshall,
writing
for
the
court
in
the
percheman
case
in
1833,
i
believe
it
was,
reversed
his
prior
ruling...
may
i
continue,
your
honor?
mr.
ernest
g.
taylor,
jr.
all
right.
thank
you,
your
honor.
