well,
in
washington
could
a
police
officer
have
obtained
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
washington
is
different
from
most
other
states
in
that
regard?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
a
state
where
a
police
officer
could
obtain
the
arrest
warrant,
even
though
the
prosecutor
filed
the
information
against
a
defendant,
would
the
police
officer
have
absolute
immunity
under
our
case
law
for
a
false
statement
in
getting
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
we
would
look
at
the
function,
this
court
said.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
would
be
the
function
if
the
police
officer
were
getting
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
do
you
say
that
the
function
is
different
in
washington,
where
the
prosecutor
gets
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
is
it
the
same
function?
i
don't
know
how
you
analyze
what
the
function
is
when
the...
in
this
case,
where
it
is
the
prosecuting
attorney
who
gets
the
arrest
warrant.
how
is
that
different
from
where
the
police
officer
does?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now
in
the
burns
case
i
think
we
gave
absolute
immunity
to
a
prosecutor
who
gave
false
evidence
at
a
hearing
to
get
a
search
warrant,
didn't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
prosecutor--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--certainly,
who
presented
the
false
evidence,
was
given
absolute
immunity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mm-hmm.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
all
boils
down
to
how
you
analyze
the
function,
and
in
one
sense
you
can
say
that
in
malley
the
function
being
performed
by
the
police
officer
in
signing
the
affidavit
was
to
further
the
investigation
for
a
crime,
and
here
the
function
being
served
was
to
further
the
prosecution
of
a
criminal,
an
alleged
crime.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
was
an
initiation
of
a
prosecution
here,
and
there
was
not
at
this
stage
in
malley.
