justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
a
police
officer
never
has
absolute
immunity
because
he's
always
engaged
in
investigating
and
never
crosses
the
divide
into
prosecuting,
so
that
the
same...
the
very
same
act
which
we
all
agree
is
involved
here,
the
same
act
is
characterized
one
way
if
it's
done
by
a
police
officer,
a
different
way
if
it's
done
by
the
prosecutor,
because
the
prosecutor
does
prosecute,
and
police
officers
don't
prosecute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
does
the
same
act,
swearing
out
this
warrant
application,
become
prosecutorial
if
done
by
one
person
but
merely
investigatory
if
done
by
another?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--absolute
immunity
but
not
perjury,
would
there
be,
or
just
absolute
immunity
from
a
1983
suit,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
i
understand
that
you
are
drawing
a
straight
time
line?
you
are
saying
yes,
under
malley
it
doesn't
matter
who
the
actor
is,
it's
the
function,
so
you
are
saying...
which
i
didn't
understand
from
the
brief...
that
whether
it's
a
police
officer
or
prosecutor,
once
it's
the
prosecution
is
being
put
before
the
court,
anybody
who
signs
this
application
gets
absolute
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it's
removed,
it's
before
the
prosecutor
has
decided
whether
there's
going
to
be
a
criminal
case,
then
it's
only
qualified
whoever
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
ford,
you
could
not
have
made
a
complaint
for
essentially
malicious
prosecution
against
a
prosecutor,
could
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
really
saying
that
less
is
more
in
this
case.
in
other
words,
by
slicing
it
thinner
and
saying
we're
just
going
to
go
after
this
arrest
warrant,
you
are
able
to
bring
a
1983
case,
where
your
fundamental
grievance
of
malicious
prosecution,
you
can't
bring
under
1983
because
that
would
surely
trigger
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
largest...
if
we
were
talking
not
in
lawyer's
terms,
the
largest
offense
to
your
client
is
that
this
client
was
not
only
arrested,
but
that
there
was
a
prosecution
initiated,
criminal
charges
filed
against
that
person.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
because
you're
slicing
it
thinner
because
under
the
law
malicious
prosecution
is
not
an
avenue
that's
open
to
you.
you
could...
do
you
disagree
with
that,
that
that's
why
you're
bringing
this
case
as
a
false
arrest
case
rather
than
the
larger
false
prosecution?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
mr.
ford,
if
the
prosecutor
did
the
same
thing,
but
once
the
trial
is
going
on
says,
i
need
to
arrest
this
material
witness,
and
the
police
report
tells
me
this,
this,
and
this,
and
so
i
swear
out
an
arrest
warrant,
but
it's
in
court
while
the
trial
is
going
on
to
hold
the
material
witness,
that
would
be
absolutely
immune?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you're
talking
about
witness,
it's
the
same
swear...
i
swear,
this
is
what
the
police
report,
i
gather
from
the
police
report...
and
it's
the
same
exact
form
as
the
one
that
leads
to
the
prosecution,
but
it
happens
during
the
trial.
if...
just
your
puzzlement
shows
it
isn't
that
easy
to
draw
the
line
between
what
is
advocacy
and
what
is
testimony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
why
are
you
having
such
a
problem
with
this
case?
you
say
maybe
there
would
be
prosecutorial
immunity
if
the
very
same
thing
happened
while
the
trial
was
going
on.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
trying
to
work
out
if
that
is--
--is
that
boilerplate?
is
this
typical
of
what
goes
into
a
prosecutor's
certificate
for
determination
of
probable
cause,
those
words,
is
familiar
with
the
police
report,
the
case
contains?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
thought
you
said
in
answer
to
my
question
if
a
prosecutor
swears
to
something
while
the
trial
is
ongoing,
that
would
be
ranked
as
prosecutorial
even
though
it
involves
swearing,
so
i
thought
you
were
conceding
that
you
could
have
sworn
plus
prosecutorial.
