mr.
norman
maleng
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
important
question
of
whether
a
prosecutor
is
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
when
she
causes
an
arrest
warrant
to
issue
in
conjunction
with
her
filing
of
criminal
charges
against
an
individual.
in
this
case,
deputy
prosecutor
lynne
kalina
reviewed
and
professionally
evaluated
a
completed
police
report,
determined
that
a
burglary
charge
would
be
filed,
and
then
prepared
and
filed
an
information,
a
motion
requesting
the
issuance
of
an
arrest
warrant,
and
a
certification
which
summarized
the
evidence
for
the
court.
in
imbler,
buckley,
and
burns,
this
court
set
forth
a
workable
approach
to
determine
which
functions
of
a
prosecutor
are
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
absolute
immunity
applies
when
the
challenged
activity
is
undertaken
in
the
prosecutor's
role
as
advocate
for
the
state,
is
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process,
and
is
connected
with
the
initiation
and
conduct
of
a
prosecution.
mr.
norman
maleng
it
was
a
burglary
charge,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
as
a
part
of
the
charging
package
is,
the
deputy
prosecutor
prepared
an
information
which
was
the
initial
pleading
in
a
prosecution,
also
requested
the
issuance
of
an
arrest
warrant,
and
provided
the
certification
to
the
court
to
meet
the
gernstein
requirement.
each
of
the
factors
which--
mr.
norman
maleng
--justice
o'connor,
the
police
officer
could
not
have
obtained
the
arrest
warrant.
mr.
norman
maleng
it
is
different
than
many
states
and,
of
course,
there's
a
diversity
of
procedures
throughout
the
united
states,
but
in
the
state
of
washington
is
that
an
arrest
warrant
cannot
be
issued
unless
it's
in
connection
with
the
filing
of
a--
mr.
norman
maleng
--no,
justice
o'connor,
the
police
officer
would
not
have
absolute
immunity.
mr.
norman
maleng
we
would
look
to
the
function,
but--
mr.
norman
maleng
--if
a
police
officer
was
obtaining
the
arrest
warrant
it
would
be
the
part
of
the
completion
of
his
investigation
in
preparation
for
handing
the
case
over
to
the
prosecutor.
i
might
just--
mr.
norman
maleng
--the
principles
that
we
are
advocating--
mr.
norman
maleng
--the
analysis
is
really
the
same
in
this
sense.
it
is
part
of
the
initiation
of
a
prosecution
by
a
prosecutor,
and
as
a
part
of
that
initiation,
a
prosecutor,
as
recognized
in
the
buckley
case,
can
take
a
whole
series
of
preliminary
acts
leading
up
to
that
initiation.
in
our
state,
one
of
those
preliminary
acts
that
goes
together
with
the
information
is
the
preparation
of
a
certification.
in
other
states,
and
let's
say
a
grand
jury
state,
is
that
a
police
office
may
obtain
an
arrest
warrant
and
that
would
be
different
than
occurs
in
our
state,
but
the
police
officer
is
performing
a
different
function.
the
principal
in
imbler
protects
that
sensitive
decision
for
prosecutors
to
initiate
a
prosecution
and
to
conduct
a
prosecution.
mr.
norman
maleng
no--
mr.
norman
maleng
--under
our
state
procedures,
at
least
in
king
county's
as
a
local
rule,
is
that
we
are
required
to
provide
a
summary,
a
brief
summary
of
the
facts
for
the
court,
and
so
our
certification
really
meets
two
purposes.
one
is
the
gernstein
requirement,
but
in
king
county
we
have
a
local
rule
that
requires
us
to
provide
a
brief
summary
to
the
court.
mr.
norman
maleng
in
the
state
of
washington
as
a
matter
of
routine,
any
time
that
we
file
an
information
in
a
felony
case
is
that
we
request
the
issuance
of
an
arrest
warrant.
the
next
step
that
is
taken,
if
it's
a
less
serious
type
of
a
felony
offense,
is
that
a
series
of
letters
is
sent
out
to
the
defendant,
which
occurred
in
the
case
before
the
court,
requesting
their
voluntary
appearance,
and
if
that
occurs,
the
case
proceeds.
mr.
norman
maleng
after
the
arrest
warrant
was
ordered
by
the
court
but
before
it
was
actually
served
there
was
several
letters
that
were
sent
to
the
defendant,
but
they
went
to
the
wrong
address,
and
did
not
reach
the
defendant,
and
when
that
occurred
the
arrest
warrant
was
served.
mr.
norman
maleng
the
certification,
yes,
does
need
to
be
under
the
oath
to
meet
the
gernstein
requirement,
is
that
we
really
adopted
this
procedure
in
the
state
of
washington
following
the
gernstein
decision,
and
it
not
only
meets
the
requirements
of
gernstein,
but
we
believe
that
it
is
a
better
practice
to
follow
to
have
the
prosecutor
prepare
this
document,
and
the
reason
is,
is
that
i
think
it
really
acts
as
a
citizen's
buffer,
is
that
a
prosecutor,
by
preparing
the
certification,
i
think
provides
for
a
more
thorough
evaluation
of
the
police
file.
you're
not
just
reading
through
it,
but
you're
required
to
prepare
a
summary.
and
it's
also
a
benefit
to
the
court,
because
it
provides
a
more
orderly
flow
of
information
to
the
court,
rather
than
getting
it
from,
let's
say
in
king
county,
where
there's
26
different
police
jurisdictions.
mr.
norman
maleng
there's
no...
yes.
there's
no
requirement
in
the
state
of
washington
that
it
be
prepared
by
a
prosecutor.
it
could
have
been
prepared
by
a
police
officer,
but
it
is
the
standard
practice
in
the
39
counties
in
the
state
of
washington
and
really
for
the
reasons
that
i
advanced.
mr.
norman
maleng
under
those
circumstances
the...
if
it
was
prepared
by
a
police
officer,
he
would
not
have
absolute
immunity
unless
he
was--
mr.
norman
maleng
--first
is
that,
unlike
a
prosecutor,
is
the
police
officer
wouldn't
meet
the
threshold
question
of
immunity
analysis,
and
that
is
that
there's
no
common
law
tradition
of
absolute
immunity
for
a
police
officer.
mr.
norman
maleng
justice
souter,
they're
performing
different
functions.
the--
mr.
norman
maleng
--this
court
has
set
forth
the
functional
test
and
said
that
we
look
to
the
nature
and
function
of
the
act
being
performed,
and
not
just
to
the
act
itself.
mr.
norman
maleng
it
is
a
different
function
if
it's
performed
by
a
police
officer,
as
a
police
officer
can't
move
from
the
"investigative
function"
over
to
the
prosecutorial
advocatory
function,
namely--
mr.
norman
maleng
--a
police
officer,
justice
ginsburg,
would
have
absolute
immunity
if
they
were
functioning
as
a
witness.
i
believe
a
police
officer
also,
if
he
was
attached
to
a
prosecutor's
office
and
was
acting
under
the
direction
of
a
prosecutor
and
acting
as
the
agent,
yes,
they
would
have
absolute
immunity
in
that
circumstances,
but
generally
no,
because
they
are
performing
a
different
function.
mr.
norman
maleng
this
court
has
indicated
also,
i
believe,
is
that
you
can
have
a
situation
in
which
prosecutors
do
a
whole
series
of
preliminary
acts
in
conjunction
with
the
filing
of
criminal
charges.
now,
some
of
those
acts
can
be
performed
by
someone
other
than
a
prosecutor,
for
example,
a
police
officer
questioning
witnesses,
visiting
a
crime
scene,
signing
a
certification.
but
when
those
functions
are
performed
by
a
prosecutor,
the
full
force
and
reasons
for
absolute
immunity
apply.
the
difference
between
that
and
the
police
officer
is
that
the
police
officer
can't
be
a
part
of
the
function
that
this
court
has
protected,
and
the
function
that
is
being
protected
is
the
sensitive
decision
to
initiate
a
prosecution
which
can
involve,
as
the
buckley
case
said
and
this
court
reaffirmed,
can
have
a
whole
series
of
things
associated
with
that,
so
it
is
really
a
different
function.
mr.
norman
maleng
justice
souter,
i
think
you've
really
raised
the
issue
before
the
court,
and
that
is
whether
you
take
the
broad
view
or
the
narrow
view.
i
think
that
what
the
court
was
indicating
in
the
malley
case
is
expressing
also
a
concern
in
making
incognizance
comparisons
between
the
activities
of
police
officers
and
the
activities
of
prosecutors,
and
shows
that
there's
a
dramatic
difference
between
those
type
of
activities.
mr.
norman
maleng
malley
took
the
view
that
a
police
officer
cannot
be
held
to
be
analogous
to
a
prosecutor.
mr.
norman
maleng
what
the
court
indicated,
justice
souter,
in
the
malley
case
is
that
the
police
officer
in
that
situation
was
one
step
removed,
really,
from
the
initiation
of
a
prosecution,
and
was
really
not
intimately
associated
with
the
judicial
phase
of
the
criminal
process,
and
that's
true
throughout
the
whole
activities,
because,
as
i
indicated,
what
the
court
was
seeking
to
do
in
the
imbler
case
is
to
protect
the
sensitive
decision
to
prosecute,
to
initiate
a
prosecution,
and
the
court
in
the
buckley
cases
reaffirmed
the
fact
that
a
prosecutor
may
undertake
a
whole
series
of
preliminary
acts
in
conjunction
with
the
initiation
of
that
prosecution.
mr.
norman
maleng
in
the
state
of
washington,
it
is
the
practice
that
we
follow,
but
ms.
kalina
was
not
a
testifying
or
complaining
witness
in
this
case,
is
that
her
certification
specifically
disclaimed
the
role
of
being
a
testifying
witness.
she
did
not
purport
to
offer
first-hand
knowledge.
mr.
norman
maleng
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page...
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page--
mr.
norman
maleng
--19,
it
indicates
at
the
beginning
that
lynne
kalina
is
a
deputy
prosecutor
and
is
familiar
with
the
police
report,
and
investigation
conducted
in
the
seattle
police
department
case,
that
this
case
contains
the
following
upon
which
the
motion
for
the
determination
of
probable
cause
is
made.
mr.
norman
maleng
she
is
required
to
sign
it
under
oath
for
purposes
of
meeting
the
gernstein
principle,
but
the
fact
that
she
does
or
doesn't
sign
shouldn't
be
the
factor
that
determines
whether
absolute
immunity
applies
or
not.
mr.
norman
maleng
there
was
an
affidavit,
justice
stevens,
in
the
file
from
the
principal
that
mr.
fletcher
had
no
association
with
the
school,
and
that
was
the--
mr.
norman
maleng
--that
is
correct.
mr.
norman
maleng
it
would
have
been
preferred
if
she'd
made
a
reference
to
the
affidavit.
mr.
norman
maleng
yes.
mr.
norman
maleng
yes.
mr.
norman
maleng
we
believe
that
there
is
a
probable
cause--
mr.
norman
maleng
--under
our
procedures
is
that
she's
stating
that
she's
familiar
with
the
report,
and
that
she--
mr.
norman
maleng
--yes.
mr.
norman
maleng
yes,
justice
souter,
because
under...
you
can
meet
the
gernstein
requirement
with
hearsay
evidence,
and
that
is
the
character
of
the--
mr.
norman
maleng
--trial
lawyers
and
prosecutors
routinely
make
factual
representations
to
the
court,
and
they're
under
high
duty
to
tell
the
truth
whether
they
are
sworn
or
not
sworn.
