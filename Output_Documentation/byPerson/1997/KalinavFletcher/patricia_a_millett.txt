ms.
patricia
a.
millett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
o'connor
and
justice
souter
both
asked
the
critical
question
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
how
we
define
the
function
that
is
at
issue.
we
believe
it's
defined
as
it
was
in
malley,
and
that
is
the
function
of
seeking
an
arrest
warrant,
not
simply
the
signing
of
a
certification.
what
is
critical
in
this
case,
and
is
a
critical
distinction
from
malley,
is
the
function
of
seeking
an
arrest
warrant
in
conjunction
with
the
filing
of
criminal
charges
against
an
individual.
in
malley,
the
police
officer
sought
the
arrest
warrant
without
the
involvement
of
a
prosecutor
long
before
any
indictment
process
had
started
by
a
prosecutor.
there
was
no
prosecutorial
decision.
in
that
sense,
the
criminal
judicial
process
had
not
yet
been
invoked
by
the
government,
and
that
is
the
critical
distinction
in
this
case
in
our
opinion.
the
reason--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--we
believe
that
she
would
get
absolute
immunity
for
statements
in
court,
whether
it
would
be
considered
prosecutorial
immunity
or
witness
immunity
under
burns
v.
reed
and
briscoe
v.
lahue.
it
may
not
satisfy
the
fourth
amendment,
but,
of
course,
the
fourth
amendment
violation
does
not
strip
one
of
immunity,
else
it
would
be
no
immunity
at
all.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
i
think
it
depends...
arrest
warrant.
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--a
search
warrant
may
be
much
further
away
from
the
criminal
judicial
process,
but
once
the
process
has
been
initiated
by
the
government,
as
it
has
here,
or
triggered
as
it
is
in
the
federal
system,
that
as
written
or...
whether
a
statement
is
written
or
said
in
court
should
not
make
a
functional
difference
for
purposes
of
absolute
immunity,
so
we
actually
believe
that
had
a
police
officer
signed
it
or,
for
example,
the
suspect
information
report
that
was
also
filed
with
the
information
and
request
for
arrest
warrant
here
would
merit
absolute
immunity.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
would.
the
police
officer
probably
wouldn't
be
called
prosecutorial
immunity,
but
it
would
be
the
traditional
common
law
immunity
for
affidavits.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--if
it
were
a
police
officer,
the
label
might
be
witness...
i'm
not
sure
if
absolute
immunity
attaches,
or
whether
the
exact
label
matters,
but
what's--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--all
right.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
two
things.
one,
if
that
had
been
filed
at
the
initiation
or
onset
of
the
formal
procedures
by
the
government--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--right,
and
the
reason
i'm
equivocating
somewhat
about
a
prosecutor
here
is
just
because
i
think
that
she
was
performing
a
hybrid
function
here.
if,
instead,
ms.
kalina
had
simply
been
a
witness
at
a
barroom
fight--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--mm-hmm.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
under
witness
or,
one
wants
to
call
it
affidavit
immunity.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
it
would
matter
for
some
things,
but
right,
certainly
for
purposes
of
whether
absolute
immunity
attaches,
but
i
think
the
reasoning
here
is
a
little
more
complicated,
because...
and
one
of
our
concerns
in
this
case--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--from
civil
liability
damages.
certainly,
no
one
is
pretending
that
absolute
immunity
gives...
even
judges
don't
get
it
from
criminal
prosecutions
or
perjury
charges,
or--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i
believe--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--i...
taking
the
first
part
of
your
question,
i
believe
the
time
line
is
absolutely
critical
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether...
is
a
critical
factor
in
functional
analysis,
and
yes,
it's
very
relevant
here,
because
the
time
line...
it's
not
so
much
a
date
time
line,
but
it's
an
initiation
of
the
judicial
process,
which
is
exactly
what
the
purposes
of
immunity
doctrine
are
supposed
to
cover.
i
think
before
actual
initiation
of
a
criminal
prosecution
or
a
criminal
proceedings,
say
if
there
was
a
search
warrant
back
at
the
investigatory
stage,
it's
a
harder
question,
because
in
one
sense
any
time
a
prosec...
and
this
is
what
the
court
noted
in
burns
v.
reed.
any
time
a
prosecutor
is
coming
to
a
court
and
presenting
information
to
the
court
to
provide
the
basis
for
a
judicial
action,
that
that
should
merit
absolute
prosecutorial
immunity.
you're
acting
in
an
advocatory
role,
and
the
reason
we
give
immunity
is
to
protect
the
process
itself,
the
ability
of
the
court
to
collect
information
and
make
the
decisions
necessary
in
that
case.
so
it
may
be
a
little
bit
harder
when
we're...
the
further
we
get
away
from
the
initiation
of
the
criminal
process,
the
harder
the
question
is.
we
concede
that.
but
you
would
still
need
to
consider
the
important
goal
of
absolute
immunity
to
allow
the
judicial
system
to
receive
information,
however
delivered,
whether
one
thinks
it's
a
proper
way
or
improper,
ethical
or
unethical,
whatever
mistaken...
but
the
important
thing
is
that
the
process
be
protected,
and
that's
what
we
think
absolute
immunity
would
protect
in
this
situation.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
the
closest,
strongest
case
for
the
common
law
precedent
for
immunity
in
this
context
which
we
think
is
on
fours
with
this
situation
is
a
case,
kitler
v.
kelsh,
which
is
cited
i
believe
on
page
19
of
our
brief,
and
was
cited
by
this
court
in
imbler.
and
there
what
you
had
was
a
prosecutor
who
sought
an
arrest
warrant,
swore
out
a
complaint,
and
in
that
context,
from
the
description
in
the
case,
the
complaint
was
not
only
legal
claims
but
also
factual
claims
and,
in
fact,
when
you
look
at
the
dissent
in
that
case,
the
dissent
advocated
drawing
the
exact
line
that
respondents
propose
here,
and
that
is
that
you
get
absolute
immunity
for
filing
the
complaint
and
seeking
the
arrest
warrant
but
not
for
the
factual
assertions.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
well,
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--well,
i
think
it...
there's
more
than
sort
of
two
factors
coming
together.
there's
also
the
question
of
whether
it
was
private
or
a
public
prosecutorial
decision
that
was
being
made.
for
example,
the
complaining
witness
cases
that
are
cited
by
this
court
in
the
malley
case
all
involved
private
persons,
and
so
there's
an
entirely
separate
argument
for
why
absolute
immunity
did
not
attach
to
that,
and
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--no.
the
implication
is
that
malley
was
different,
because
the
police
officer
there
was
not
involved
with
the
prosecutor
in
a
prosecutorial
decision
to
initiate
criminal
proceedings.
the
police
officer
was
more
analogous
to
a
private
complaining
witness
than
we
have
here,
where
ms.
kalina,
or
the
police
officer,
or
whomever
is
signing
the
affidavit,
is
affiliated
with
the
actual
onset
of
judicial
proceedings,
and
it
is
the
onset
of
judicial
proceedings
and
the
provision
of
information
to
the
court
for
that
ongoing
process
that
is
critical.
and
one
of
the
reasons
it's
critical
is,
again,
unlike
the
police
officer
in
malley
v.
briggs,
a
prosecutor
in
this
context
is
going
to
have
ongoing
responsibilities
in
the
case
and
ongoing
duties
that
will
be
supervised
and
protected
by
the
court,
and
the
defendant
will
also
have
those
protections.
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
what
is
critical
is
whether
it
is
the
initiation...
whether
that
would
be
combined
with
a
prosecutorial
decision
to,
as
here,
initiate
a
criminal
prosecution.
who
signs
it?
as
i
said,
we
think
the--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--yes,
whether
it
would
be
called
prosecutorial
immunity
or
not.
thank
you--
ms.
patricia
a.
millett
--mr.
chief
justice.
