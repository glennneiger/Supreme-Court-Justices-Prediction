19,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
other
situations--
--but
you
know,
there's
a
sentence
in
her...
excuse
me.
there's
a
sentence
in
her
certification
that
purports
to
be
a
statement
of
fact.
the
defendant,
rodney
fletcher,
has
never
been
associated
with
the
school
in
any
manner
and
did
not
have
permission
to
enter
the
school.
she
states
that
as
a
fact,
not
as...
that's
not
a
fact
that
would
necessarily--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
person
to
who...
who
issued
the
warrant
relied
on
that
as
a
statement
of
fact
by
the
person
who
signed
the
certificate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
was
an
inaccurate
statement
purporting
to
be
given
by
her
own...
you
see,
she...
would
let
the
reader
think
she's
saying
she
knew
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
be
the
same
case
if
she
had
filed
a
certification
just
as
a
lawyer
but
not
sworn
to
anything,
and
then
the
magistrate
had
said
to
her
when
she
appeared
in
court,
i'd
like
to
know
whether
the
defendant
had
any
access
to
the
property
before,
do
you
have
a
witness
who
can
testify
to
that,
and
she
had
responded,
yes,
and
then
he
swore
her
as
a
witness
and
she
said
exactly
what
she
said
here.
would
she
be
immune?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
the
witness
immunity
in
the
context
of
testimony
at
trial
applies
to
any
sworn
statement
in
support
of
an
affidavit
for
a
search
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
arrest
warrant.
either
one,
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
your
view,
then...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
your
view
is,
even
if
this
had
been
signed
by
a
police
officer,
there
would
be
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
relying
not
on
prosecutorial
immunity
but
witness
immunity
as
your
basic
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
that
applies
in
this
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
matters
a
great
deal,
i
think.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
under
your
theory
here
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
she's
a
prosecutor
at
all,
because
you're
suggesting,
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
any
affidavit,
any
person
who
makes
an
affidavit
in
support
of
an
arrest
warrant
is
entitled
to
absolute
immunity.
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
the
time
you
file
an
information
and
so
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
understand,
but
i'm
asking
to
the
extent
that
she's
performing
the
half
of
the
hybrid
that
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--testimonial
rather
than
a
lawyer
presenting
a
case
to
a
judge.
that
half
you
say
is
equally
entitled
to
immunity
under
the
witness
immunity
doctrine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it
doesn't
matter
whether
she's
a
prosecutor
or
a
member
of
the
mafia
or
a
police
officer,
she's
still
entitled
to--
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
rises
out
of
the
burglary
of
some
computer
equipments
form
a
school
in
king
country,
washington.
respondent
was
charged
with
that
crime,
arrested
and
spent
a
day
in
jail
before
the
charges
against
him
were
dismissed.
the
petitioner
is
the
deputy
prosecuting
attorney
for
the
county
who
prepared
the
case
against
the
respondent.
in
supportive
promotion
for
an
arrest
warrant,
she
personally
executed
an
affidavit
that
summarized
the
bases
for
the
burglary
charge.
unfortunately,
in
that
affidavit
she
made
a
two
important
misstatements:
first
after
stating
that
the
respondent's
fingerprints
had
been
found
on
the
glass
partition
in
the
area
work
from
which
the
computer
equipment
was
stolen.
she
stated
that
he
had
never
been
authorized
to
entered
the
promises
before
when
in
fact
he
had
been
actually
worked
on
the
installation
of
the
glass
partition
on
which
his
fingerprints
were
found
and
secondly,
she
said
that
he
had
been
identified
by
a
person
in
electronics
store
which
he
asked
to
appraise
the
stolen
equipment
when
in
fact
that
person
had
identified
someone
else.
so,
based
on
those
mistakes
respondent
and
brought
to
sued
for
damages
against
her,
claiming
that
she
had
violated
his
constitutional
right
to
be
free
from
unreasonable
seizures.
the
petitioner
defended
the
case
on
the
ground
that
as
a
prosecutor
she
was
entitled
absolute
immunity.
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
rejected
the
defense,
and
we
are
granted
certiorari
to
resolve
the
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
the
basic
question.
our
cases
make
it
clear
that
the
a
prosecutor
is
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
when
she
was
acting
as
an
advocate
for
the
state
in
judicial
proceeding,
that
immunity
protected
the
petitioner
in
her
action
in
this
case
in
drafting
the
various
papers
that
were
brought
to
commence
the
proceeding
and
in
filing
those
and
in
appearing
in
court.
but
the
critical
question
in
this
particular
case
is
whether
that
immunity
also
protected
her
when
she
personally
swore
to
the
truth
of
the
false
statements
of
fact
in
the
certificate
she
filed
with
the
court.
when
in
other
words
she
was
performing
the
function
with
complaining
witness,
rather
than
that
of
an
advocate.
for
reasons
stated
in
the
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk,
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals,
that
in
so
far
as
she
acted
as
such
a
witness,
she
was
not
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
and
therefore,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion,in
which
justice
thomas
has
joined.
