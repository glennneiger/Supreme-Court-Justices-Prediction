justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
can
that
be?
i
don't...
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
the
procedure.
you
mean,
if,
in
conjunction
with
the
issuance
of
a
case,
the
prosecution
decides
i'd
like
to
arrest
mr.
smith
under
washington
law...
it's
a
felony.
you
need
probable
cause
and
a
warrant...
couldn't
the
policeman
attest
to
the
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
if
a
policeman's
walking
down
the
street
and
he
sees
a
crime--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
he
knows
there
is
a
crime
going
on,
and
he
wants
to
produce
a
warrant,
and
he
goes
to
the
magistrate
and
says,
please
give
me
a
warrant.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
can't
do
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
if
there's
no
case
going
on
a
policeman
couldn't
just
get
a
warrant
for
an
arrest
ordinarily,
when
he
knows
there's
a
crime
going
on
in
a
building
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
a
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
they
saying...
and
here
i
may
be
speaking...
you
have
to
correct
me
if
i'm
not...
that
in
many
states
i
would
guess
it's
possible
for
a
policeman
to
get
a
warrant
and
arrest
somebody
a
few
hours
or
days
before
a
prosecutor
does
anything
in
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
then
they're
saying,
but
washington,
oddly
enough,
that
isn't
so.
in
washington,
the
only
time
you
arrest
a
felon
with
a
warrant,
the
only
time,
is
in
conjunction
with
a
prosecutor
filing
an
information,
and
there
is
no
other
time,
and
therefore,
unlike
all
other
states,
because
of
this
odd
quirk
of
washington
procedure,
the
arrest
of
a
felon
is
part
of
the
court
function,
the
court
filing
function.
it's
not
in
rhode
island,
it's
not
anywhere
else,
because
it
exists
in
other
places
that
you
could
arrest
a
person
without
filing
an
information,
but
not
so
in
washington,
so
in
those
other
places
it's
a
police
duty,
in
washington
it's
different.
in
washington,
it's
part
of
the
case-initiating.
i'm
not
buying
that
argument,
but
i
want
to
focus
it
specifically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
help
me
with
something
else
i
don't
know,
and
perhaps...
are
there
grand
jury
indictments
as
well
in
washington?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
all
right.
when
the
grand
jury
indicts
someone,
then
that's
automatically
probable
cause
to
try
the
person,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right...
oh.
well,
what
i
really
wanted
to
know
is,
is
it
also
probable
cause
to
arrest
the
person
without
going
through
any
other
procedure?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
do
you...
are
you
familiar
enough...
in
instances
where
a
case
begins
through
an
information,
in
which
case
the
prosecutor,
i
take
it,
signs
a
statement
and
says,
these
are
the
facts,
and
this
is
sufficient,
and
if
it's
accepted
i
take
it
that
makes
probable
cause
for
beginning
the
trial...
is
that
what
an
information
does?
you
write
out
on
a
piece
of
paper
what
the
facts
are,
and
you
say
that
this
is
the...
these
constitute
the
crime,
and
you
give
it
to
the
judge,
and
now
the
judge
says
yes,
we
can
begin
the
trial
now.
is
that
basically
how
it
works?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
do
you
need
some
backup
for
that
to
begin
the
trial?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
need
probable
cause
to
begin
the
procedure?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
could
bring...
you
could
bring,
if
you
don't
arrest
somebody,
a
proceeding
against
him
in
a
criminal
court
without
probable
cause?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
see,
i'm
bothered
by
this
slightly
odd
phrasing
of
the...
of
what
she
swore
to.
it
was
that
i
am
familiar
with
the
police
report,
and
the
case
contains
the
following,
and
it's
as
if
she's
vouching
for
it
but
not
stating
it.
i
don't
know
how
to
deal
with
this...
it's
a
rather
unusual
animal,
and
i
don't
know
how
to
think
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
then
follow
a
bunch
of
factual
statements.
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
this
odd
way--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
she's
not
vouching
for
it.
she's
not
even
vouching...
i
mean,
she's
not
saying
she
knows
it.
she's
saying
it's
in
the
police
report.
that's
what
she
knows.
