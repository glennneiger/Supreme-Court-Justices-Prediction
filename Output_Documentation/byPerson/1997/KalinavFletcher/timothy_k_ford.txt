mr.
timothy
k.
ford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
by
answering
a
couple
of
questions
that
i
don't
think
got
answered.
one
is,
our
claim
is
based
exclusively
on
the
fact
that
rodney
fletcher
was
arrested,
that
his
person
was
seized
without
probable
cause,
and
that
has
been
our
position
from
the
beginning.
the
focus
of
this
is
on
the
certification
that
made
it
possible,
both
under
the
federal
constitution
and
washington
criminal
rule
2.2,
for
an
arrest
warrant
rather
than
a
summons
to
issue.
another
question
i'd
like
to
point
out
is
washington
law
does
provide
for
summons
procedures
in
felony
cases,
nonseizure-type
documents.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
it
is
not
in
the
nature
of
a
defamation
claim,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
false
arrest
claim,
just
as
the
malley
case
was,
and,
of
course,
under
the
albright
case
there's
considerable
controversy
at
least
over
whether
you
even
have
a
1983
claim
if
you
are
only
hailed
into
court
by
summons,
and
certainly
mr.
fletcher's
damages
would
be
very
different
if
they
existed
at
all.
the
next
question,
i'd
like
to
answer
justice
o'connor's
question
about
whether
police
officers
can
issue
these...
can
swear
in
support
of
arrest
warrants,
and
they
certainly
can,
and
i
think
it
is...
actually
i
would
differ
with
mr.
maleng
with
regard
to
whether,
under
washington
law,
a
police
officer
could
obtain
an
arrest
warrant
without
the
interposition
of
a
prosecutor.
under
our
justice
court
rules,
or
lower
court
rules,
washington
has
a
procedure
where
the
prosecutors
have
begun
to
file
direct
in
superior
court
informations,
felonies
without
going
through
preliminary
hearings
in
the
lower
courts.
in
our
lower
courts,
the
district
courts
and
municipal
courts,
we
have
a
criminal
rule
for
the
courts
of
limited
jurisdiction,
2.1(c),
which
provides
even
citizens
can
issue
complaints,
and
those
complaints
can
be
followed
by
arrest
warrants,
again
if
a
complainant
swears
under
oath
to
facts
that
make
out
probable
cause.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that
rule
itself,
your
honor,
would
only
deal
with
misdemeanors,
but
in
felonies
you
can
also
have
those
same
courts
have
jurisdiction
issue
arrest
warrants,
although
i
admit
it
would
not
be
on
the
complaint
only
of
a
citizen
or
police
officer
for
felonies.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
this
was
a
felony,
although
i'm
not...
i
would
contend
there's
no
constitutional
difference--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--the
policeman
could
attest
to
the
fact,
justice
breyer.
as
i
understood
the
question
it
was
whether
a
policeman
could
do
this
completely
by
him
or
herself.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
because
you
do...
under
washington
law
you
do
have
to
have
either
a
complaint
or
an
information
filed
in
order
to
issue
an
arrest
warrant
from
our
court.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
ever.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
he
can
make
a
warrantless
arrest.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
under
our
criminal
rules--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--he
cannot
do
that,
and
our
rules
i
do
believe--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--under
washington
procedure,
only
if
there
has
been
an
initiation
at
least
by
complaint.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
in
a
court.
however,
that
is...
and
one
thing
i
would
also
point
out,
the
certification
that
justice
kennedy
asked
about
is
a
king
county
local
rule.
it's
not
a
certification
as
a
summary,
and
it
is
not
sworn.
it
is
a
different
document,
but
they
have
the
certification
of
probable
cause.
it
is
kind
of
an
omnibus
document
that
kind
of
takes
care
of
all
of
these
problems
at
once.
the
actual
rule--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--there
has
to
be
a
sworn
statement
by
somebody
under
our
criminal
rules,
justice,
there
does
have
to
be
under
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
constitution,
so
somebody
has
to
swear.
it
does
not
have
to
be
a
prosecutor,
and
indeed
there's
no
rule.
the
certification
process
is
something
that
i
think
as
mr.
maleng
acknowledged
in
many
of
his
statements
is
going
a
bit
informally.
it's
not
provided
for
by
rule
or
statute
anywhere.
the
prosecutors
have
just
decided
they're
going
to
do
this.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that
is
my
experience,
your
honor,
yes.
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--that
is
the
difference,
justice
ginsburg.
that
is
a
claim
for
false
arrest,
and
traditionally--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
would
submit,
your
honor,
our
fundamental
claim
is
false
arrest,
and
we
would
be...
we
would
have
a
different
defendant
if
we
had
a
police
officer
who
had
issued
this
false
affidavit
that
resulted
in
the
arrest,
but
we
would
still
have
a
cause
of
action,
which
is
being
arrested
without
probable
cause.
a
public
official
under
color
of
state
law
made
up
the
probable
cause
that
resulted
in
rodney
fletcher's
arrest.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
i
don't
know.
our
complaint
has
to
do
with
his
arrest
and,
indeed,
under
albright
i'm
not--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--because
that's
what
brought
it
to
law,
because
that's
what
happened
to
rodney
fletcher.
that's
his
complaint.
he
was
hauled
into
jail.
after
that,
they...
the
prosecution
went
nowhere.
they
gave
up
very
quickly.
but
his
problem
was,
he
got
hauled
into
king
county
jail,
had
to
spend
the
night
in
jail,
have
his
wife
come
get
him
and
his
children,
those
sorts
of
things.
and
i
think
that
again
there's
a
question
even
under
the
albright
case
as
to
whether
he
could
complain
at
all
against
anybody
for
the
broader
question,
but
this
is
what
happened
to
him,
and
that's
why
the
complaint
has
been
brought
as
it
has,
because
also
what
happened
to
him
is
exactly
the
same
as
what
happened
to
mr.
briggs
in
the
malley
v.
briggs
case.
and
i
beg
to
differ
with
my
colleagues
with
regard
to
the
differences
there.
in
the
malley
v.
briggs
case
officer
malley
was
not
a
percipient
witness,
did
not
claim
to
be
if
you...
as
the
opinion
states,
but
he
went
in
and
reviewed
a
log
of--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--this
is
a
word
the
government's
come
up
with.
percipient,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that's
correct,
and
the
government's
suggested
that
there's
a
difference,
and
i
would
submit
that
there
is
not.
i
think
that
the
government
has
an
interest
in
protecting
dea
or
fbi
agents
who
often
perform
this
function
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
offices,
because
the
u.s.
attorneys
never
do
this
themselves,
but
they
are
trying
to
bring
the
immunity
to
cover
their
police
officers.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
i
believe
that
was
the
case
in
rhode
island
with
mr.--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--let
me
focus
it
specifically
on
that,
then,
justice
breyer.
it's
not
correct
in
washington,
because
you
can
arrest
somebody
in
conjunction
with
filing
a
complaint.
now,
that's
just
another
word,
but
it's
a
word
that's
very
important,
because
officer
briggs,
or
officer
malley,
i'm
sorry,
got
a
complaint.
he
swore
out
a
complaint
to
a
judge,
and
the
complaint
ordered
any
police
officer
to
bring
the
defendant
to
the
court
to
be
held
to
answer
on
the
complaint.
it
was
exactly
the
same
function.
he
was
having
him
arrested
to
answer
a
criminal
complaint
that
was
based
on
his
summary
of
a
police
report
that
he
had
read
and
he
swore
under
oath
that
that
made
out
probable
cause,
and
went
to
a
judge,
and
the
judge...
and
they
had
a
file,
it
has
a
case
number,
and
they
issued
court
documents,
a
complaint
and
an
arrest
warrant.
here
we
had
an
information
and
an
arrest
warrant.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
the
only
difference
is
a
word.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
and...
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
that's
true
for
the
sixth
amendment
purpose
of
initiating
a
criminal
prosecution,
but
for
purposes
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
for
purposes
of
the
traditional
common
law
background
that
we
were
looking
at
in
1871
there
was
no
difference.
every
variety
of
this
kind
of
behavior,
of
somebody
coming
before
a
judge
swearing
to
facts,
having
the
judge
have
a
complaint
or
a
writ
ne
exit,
or
whatever
you'd
call
it,
and
arresting
somebody
based
on
the
sworn
statement
of
that
person,
who
is
called
a
complaining
witness
at
common
law,
very
ancient
law
in
this
regard--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--well,
it's
an
initial
determination
of
probable
cause,
your
honor,
but
it
doesn't
justify
an
arrest,
and
in
washington,
of
course,
it's
not
final.
we
also
do
have
a
safeguard
under
a
case
called
state
v.
knapstad,
where
a
judge
can
determine
whether
the
prosecutor
did,
in
fact,
have
probable
cause
to
bring
this
information.
so
there
are
many
systems
in
our
country,
but
the
common
denominator
we
have
now
in
our
states
and
in
the
territories
and
states
and
even
back
into
england
in
the
law
that
this
is
based
on
is
that
when
people
come
into,
before
a
judge
or
a
magistrate
or
a
justice
of
the
peace,
or
whatever
they
happen
to
be
called
locally,
and
swear
to
facts,
and
get
some
kind
of
an
order
that
allows
somebody
else's
body
to
be
seized,
they
were
never
held
to
be
immune
from
liability
before
1871,
before
1791
when
the
oath
or
affirmation
clause
was
put
into
the
fourth
amendment
establishing
the
function
that
we
believe
is
relevant
here,
a
very
ancient
and
important
function
of
providing
that
oath
or
affirmation.
it's
never
been
subject
to
immunity,
and
the
fact
that
the
prosecutors
in
washington
have
really
voluntarily,
just
as
a
matter
of
their
own
practice
and
convenience,
or
perhaps
for
this
reason,
usurped
that
function,
without
even
the
washington
legislature
or
court
rules
telling
them
to,
and
said
well,
we'll
be
the
witnesses
here,
they
have
taken
on
a
function
that
prosecutors
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
reading...
we
cited
some
historical
materials
that
go
back
into
the
13th
and
14th
century.
the
prosecutors
and
their
predecessors
have
never
acted
as
witnesses.
it's
a
fundamentally
different
function
of
swearing
to
facts
and
bringing
the
facts
in
and
saying,
i
vouch
for
these
facts.
and
in
most
contexts,
of
course,
there
is,
as
i
think
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
a
defamation
immunity
for
witnesses,
but
there
has
always
been
an
exception
in
this
particular
context,
where
a
person
comes
in,
a
person
who
might
say
exactly
the
same
things
at
a
trial
and
be
absolutely
immune,
but
when
the
context
is
the
initiation
of
a
matter
before
some
kind
of
judicial
officer,
the
purpose
of
which
is
to
take
somebody's
body
into
custody,
that
that
person
has
never
been
held
immune
from
liability
no
matter
what
their
rank
in
society.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
i
think
the
differences
between
malicious
prosecution
and
false
arrest
and
trespass,
and
trespass
on
the
case,
and
the
different
things
in
the
common
law
have...
i
have
not
grasped
yet,
justice
scalia,
but
what
i
understand
is
that
whatever
you
called
it
at
that
time,
nobody
recognized
it
as
a
circumstance
in
which
a
person
should
be
immune
from
liability,
even
though
they
were
doing
something,
swearing,
very
much
like
what
they
could
do
in
court
under
absolute
immunity.
when
they
did
it
in
this
context,
when
ex
parte,
i
would
assume
that
the
policy
reasons
are
because
there
is
no
protection
of
the
courtroom,
it's
an
ex
parte
proceeding,
it
involves
an
initiation
of
a
very
drastic
governmental
action
against
a
person,
whatever
those
policy
reasons
were,
the
common
law
in
1871
was
clear
that
in
that
context
a
swearer,
a
person
who
took
an
oath
or
affirmation,
was
not
subject
to
the
immunities
that
they
would
be
later
in
the
proceeding,
and
i
think
that
is
the
difference,
and
there's
no
historical
basis...
this
one
1927--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--that
is
a
fascinating
question,
justice
ginsburg.
it
had
not
occurred
to
me
because
of
course
the
material
witness
is
not
a
party
to
the
lawsuit,
and
how
the
common
law
would
have
treated
that
i
do
not
know.
it
does
seem
to
me
to
be
a
part
of
advocacy,
but
it
also
seems
to
be
kind
of
like
initiating
a
new
proceeding
against
a
material
witness.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
it
is
easy
to
draw
the
line.
to
me...
and
that's
the
fundamental
issue
in
this
case.
testimony
is
not
advocacy.
swearing
is
not
making
a
decision.
you
don't
decide
whether
to
tell
the
truth
or
not.
when
you
go
under
oath,
you
tell
the
truth.
now,
you
may
be--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
was
having
trouble,
justice
ginsburg,
because
i
don't
think
anybody
ever
thought
of
that
question
before,
and
as
i'm
thinking
about
it,
i
think
that
that
is
the
initiation
of
a
new
action
against
the
material
witness,
and
would
not
be
subject
to
immunity.
now,
the
different
analogy
that
i
had
thought
of
is
what
if
the
prosecutor
swears
in
support
of
some
motion
during
the
trial
itself?
it
seems
to
me
that
is
a
different
thing
where
different
sorts
of
protections
exist.
that
is
within
the
area
that
the
common
law
would
have
found
advocacy.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
if
it's
necessary
under
the
fourth
amendment
for
that
witness
to
have
probable
cause
for
that
bench
warrant
it
seems
to
me
that
he
may
again
be
initiating
a
new
proceeding
against
that
witness
if
he's
lying,
or
she
is.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
and
i
don't
know
what
the
constitutional
requirements
would
be
with
regard
to
the
bench
warrant
under
those
circumstances,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
say
that
with
regard...
my
thoughts
have
been
with
regard
to
the
defendant
himself
or
herself.
with
regard
to
that
person,
once
you're
in
court
in
the
heat
of
battle
swearing
or
avowing
or
proffering
is
the
more
usual
situation,
that
that
is
within
the
witness
immunity
if
it's
a
witness,
the
prosecutorial
immunity
if
it's
a
prosecutor.
but
the
initiation
of
a
new
proceeding
to
arrest,
that's
where
the
common
law
has
looked,
and
i
have
not
seen
cases
that
have
focused
on,
what
if
you
initiate
a
new
proceeding
in
the
middle
of
another
proceeding.
i
would
assume
the
law
would
be
the
same,
but
i
don't
know
what
the
common
law
was
and
of
course
that,
i
think,
is
what
the
court
has
to
look
at.
what
would
have
been
the
understanding
in
17...
or
in
1871
about
liability
here,
and
it
wouldn't
necessarily
have
been
the
opinion
of
the
north
dakota
supreme
court
in
1927,
which
was
characterized
in
the
solicitor
general's
brief
as
having
been
a
suit
based
on
a
false
complaint.
that
is,
a
false
document.
i
understand
the
argument
here
would
be
very
different
if
our
only
argument
were
ms.
kalina
lied
when
she
signed
the
information
and
said
rodney
fletcher
committed
a
burglary
in
the
information.
that
is
an
immune
act.
that
is
the
initiation
of
a
prosecution.
that
is
a
decision.
that
is
advocacy.
but
when
she
takes
the
fourth
amendment
separate
rule
of
making
an
oath
or
affirmation,
she
is
doing
something
that
has
much
more
ancient
roots
and
should
not
turn
on
the...
the
difficult
lines,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
would
be
if
there
was
a
line
that
was
based
on
the
name
of
the
charging
document,
or
the
particular
local
procedure.
i
have
looked
at
a
number
of
states
in
regard
to
this,
and
the
states
are
very
various
and
the
counties,
i'm
sure,
within
states
vary
as
to
how
they
handle
criminal
prosecutions,
and
when...
where
the
police
hand
off
to
the
prosecutors,
and
to
draw
a
line
straight
through
based
on
washington's
particular
procedure
i
think
would
be
extraordinarily
difficult
and
create
different
rules
in
different
states.
and,
of
course,
in
section
1983
the
civil
rights
act
was
supposed
to,
i
think,
establish
federal
minimums
for
the
protection
of
residents
of
the
various
states
regardless
of
what
their
state
officials
decided
to
do,
and
when
the...
the
fact
that
our
state
officials
and
our
prosecutors
have
over
the
years
said,
well,
wouldn't
it
be
easier
if
we
just
swear
the
witnesses,
and
we
just
provided
the
oath
or
affirmation
rather
than
have
police
officers
or
fbi
agents
or
the
various
people
who
do
it
in
every
other
jurisdiction
of
the
country
perhaps
save
one,
that
can't
change
the
constitutional
rights
and
remedies
of
the
people
of
washington
that
were
enshrined
in
1871
and
existed
a
long
time
before
that,
of
saying
if
you
lie
about
me
and
cause
me
to
be
arrested,
i
have
a
cause
of
action
to
recover
for
my
damages
from
you.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
i
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
in
burns
the
police
officer
testified,
and
i
believe
the
police
officer
was
separately
sued
and
was
not
a
party
before
this
court.
the--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--the
prosecutor--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i...
presenting
and
acting,
asking
questions
and
even
drafting
documents,
those
are
prosecutorial-type
functions.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
but
swearing
on
the
bottom
line,
that's
when
it
changes.
that's
where
the
fourth
amendment
says
it
changes
to...
from
an
illegal
arrest
to
a
legal
arrest.
that's
where
the
common
law
said
it
changed,
and
even
magistrates
could
be
sued
at
common
law
if
there
was
no
oath
or
affirmation.
the
person
who
puts
their
name
on
that
oath
or
affirmation,
that's
what
causes
an
arrest,
and
1983
says,
a
person
who
causes
another
to
be
deprived
of
their
rights
guaranteed
by
the
constitution.
what
causes
that
arrest
is
swearing
on
the
line
that
says,
i
swear
that
this
is
true,
and
the
person
who
has
done
that
has
always
been
subject
to
liability,
i
think
was
in
the
burns
case...
in
some
ways
it's
very
much
like
in
the
buckley
case.
counsel
referred
to
buckley
as
if
the
court
granted
prosecutorial
immunity
there,
and
i
think
it
did
not,
and
i
think
that's
the
answer
to
justice
souter's
questions
about
how
broadly
do
you
define
under
the...
i
think
the
petitioners
here
are
really
refighting
buckley
and
saying,
well,
everything
we
do
is
designed
to,
you
know,
convict
or
to
prosecute
or
decide
whether
to
prosecute
or
not,
so
everything
we
do
should
be
prosecutorial,
and
buckley
certainly
said
that's
not
the
case
with
regard
to
particularly
one
function
that
was,
i
think,
very
analogous
to
what
happened
here,
which
is
the
manufacturing
of
false
evidence.
in
a
very
real
sense,
our
claim
is
that
lynne
kalina
manufactured
false
evidence
against
rodney
fletcher,
and
she
did
so
not
only
with
regard
to
the
trial,
but
with
regard
to
a
critical
moment
when
nobody
else
was
there
in
court
to
correct
it,
that
the
common
law
and
the
cases
of
the
majority
of
circuits,
certainly,
since
have
always
said
is
subject
to
liability.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
except
that,
justice
o'connor,
in
malley
what
the
police
officer
was--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--it
depends
only
on
what
you
call
a
prosecution.
there
was
a
criminal
complaint
filed
against
mr.
briggs,
and
the
request
of
officer
malley
was
that
mr.
briggs
be
apprehended
and
brought...
held...
and
held
to
answer
this
complaint.
it
wasn't,
let
him
bring
him
in
here
for
finger
prints,
or
bring
him
in
here
so
we
can
take
his
picture
and
show
it
to
witnesses.
it
was
bring
him
in
here
and
hold
him
to
answer
for
the
charge
that
i'm
getting
a
judge
to
issue
right
now,
exactly
the
same,
except
in
name,
to
what
ms.
kalina
did
here,
and
i
think
the
function
test
can't
turn
on
the
name
that
a
specific
state
gives
a
particular
document.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
there
can
be,
your
honor.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
that's
my
understanding.
it's
very
rare
in
washington.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
my
understanding
of
the
case
law
elsewhere
is
that
the
issuance
of
a
grand
jury
indictment
is
sufficient
itself
to
warrant
an
arrest
warrant.
it
would
not
be
under
washington
law.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
it's
an
allegation,
your
honor,
and
in
washington
it's
usually
summary.
it
only
says,
i--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--only
if
you
arrest.
in
washington,
you
can
initiate
a
prosecution.
ms.
kalina
could
have
charged
mr.
fletcher
simply
by
filing
an
information,
not
sworn.
he
would
not
have
been
arrested.
that
would
have
been
just
fine.
washington
procedure
provides
for
that.
they
could
have
sent--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--you
need
probable
cause
only
to
arrest
him.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
i
think
you'd
be
violating
your
oath,
and
i
think
you'd
be
subject
to
dismissal.
you
would
not
be
subject,
if
you
are
a
prosecutor,
to
a
federal
civil
rights
suit,
or
a
malicious
prosecution
action
in
washington.
the...
but
that
would...
you
can
file
the
document
and,
indeed,
that
is
the
only
required
document,
and
many
of
the...
the
question
here
is,
what
is
the
prosecutorial
function?
if
we
look
historically,
why
have
washington
prosecutors
always...
all
of
a
sudden
taken
on
the
role
of
witnesses
when
they...
no
prosecutors
have
historically
that
we
can
find,
and
the
answer
is
not
because
washington
law
requires
them
to,
because
washington
law
says
clearly
you
can
initiate
a
prosecution--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--and,
in
fact,
the
only
thing
that
is
required
is
the
filing
of
an
information.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
we
haven't
got
into
the
facts
yet,
of
course,
your
honor.
because
of
absolute
immunity
it
doesn't
matter
if
she
made
the
whole--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--or
whatever.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
right.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
number
1,
i--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
don't
know
the
last
phrase,
justice
ginsburg.
my
experience
is
that
it
is
fairly
typical
of
both
our
prosecutors
and,
of
course,
of
federal
police
or
law
enforcement
agents
in
federal
courts
who
do
the
same
thing,
summarize
reports
in
affidavits,
and
the
jones
v.
united
states
said
that
hearsay
can
be
the
basis
of
an
arrest
and
arrest
warrant,
so
that
is
what
they're
capitalizing
upon.
but
of
course
here,
our
submission,
and
what
we
plan
to
prove
is
that
not
only
was
she
testifying
falsely
about
what
mr.
fletcher
did,
but
also
she's
testifying
falsely
about
what's
in
those
police
reports,
and
that
will
be
the
question,
really,
if
we
get
to
the
question
of
qualified
immunity.
if
she
can
say,
hey,
here's
the
police
reports,
how
do
i
know,
we've
got
a
different
case,
but
our
contention
is
that
she
was
false
on
both
levels,
and--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--i
don't
think
it
should
go
on
the
formulation,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
it
goes
on
swearing
or
not
swearing.
if
they
decide
to
swear,
they're
stepping
outside
their
prosecutorial
role.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
well,
if
they
supplied
probable
cause
that
did
not
otherwise
exist
and
did
so
falsely,
they
would
be
the
person
who
is
the
appropriate
defendant,
and
i
would
think
that
that
would
render
them
liable.
i
know
of
nothing
in
the
common
law
or
any
other
cases
that
say
that
claiming
to
be
a
second-hand
witness
enables
you
to
be
absolutely
immune,
where
claiming
to
be
a
first-hand
witness
does
not,
and
oftentimes
as
long
as
you're
going
to
allow
hearsay
there's
going
to
be
hearsay.
actually,
it's
a
third-hand
witness
versus
a
second-hand
witness,
but
again,
officer
malley
was
a
second-hand
witness
testifying
to
what
was
in
the
logs
that
he
had
read
from
other
officers.
it's
exactly
the
same
thing.
that
can't
be
the
difference.
the
difference
is,
if
you
choose
to
swear,
if
you
take
on
that
police
function,
you
take
on
their
qualified
immunity.
you're
not...
you
still
have
that,
but
you
take
on
their
qualified
immunity.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
conceive
an
instance
where
the
prosecutor
could
step
out
of
the
role
and
issue
an
affidavit
that
was
not
at
least
subject
to...
i...
if
the
prosecutor
became
a
trial
witness
he
would
have
the
immunity
of
trail
witnesses,
or
she
would.
the...
if...
but
if...
so
that's
the
difference.
the
difference
is
the
common
law
difference
between
complaining
witnesses
and
trial
witnesses,
and
prosecutors
never
become
trial
witnesses
in
my
experience,
so
that's
why
i'm
having
trouble
conceiving
of
that.
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
again,
my
conception
of
that
would
be,
it's
a
new
proceeding
against
the
witness,
but
that
would
be
the
one
hard
question
that
would
be
left
under
our--
mr.
timothy
k.
ford
--conception
that
malley
should
be
maintained.
thank
you.
