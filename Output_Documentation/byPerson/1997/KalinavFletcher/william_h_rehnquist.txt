chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-792,
kalina
v.
fletcher.
mr.
maleng,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
maleng,
is
the
crucial
thing
here
the
information
or
the
application
for
the
arrest
warrant?
what
was
the
basis
for
the
action
against
the
officials?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
simply
have
an
information
filed
and
don't
seek
an
arrest
warrant,
is
this
certification
necessary--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--under
washington
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
it
possible
that
in
some
cases
in
king
county
there
would
be
an
information
filed
but
not
an
effort
to
immediately
arrest
the
person?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
here,
letters
were
sent
before
the
arrest
warrant
was
issued
requesting
the
defendant
to
surrender?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is...
does
the
prosecutor's
description
or
summary
that
you
just
explained
have
to
be
under
oath?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
did
she
disclaim
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
maleng.
ms.
millett,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
millett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ford.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
not
have
made
this
claim
if
there
had
been
no
actual
arrest.
even
though
the
arrest
warrant
or
the
certification
might
have
been...
it's
not
in
the
nature
of
a
defamation
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
jurisdiction
over...
what
kind
of
criminal
actions
do
those
lower
courts
have
jurisdiction
over?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
was
a
felony
involved
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
what
kind
of
a
witness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
one...
i
hear
someone--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
in
malley
the
person
was
arrested
on
the
basis
of
this
complaint,
but
a
grand
jury,
which
in
rhode
island
is
apparently
committed
to
the
job
of
finding...
refused
to
indict.
here
the
information
is
a
substitute
for
the
indictment,
not
the
complaint,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
point
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
if
you
compare
the
facts
in
malley
with
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
facts
in
malley
seem
to
have
been
further
removed
from
the
determination
of
probable
cause,
because
there
it
ultimately
went
to
a
grand
jury
after
all
the
malley
facts
had
happened,
and
the
grand
jury
refuses
to
indict.
here,
the
information
is
filed,
and
that
in
itself
is
a
determination
of
probable
cause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
prosecutor
avows
or
swears
to
the
court,
i
subpoena
this
witness,
he's
not
here,
i
ask
you
to
issue
a
bench
warrant?
protected
or
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
subpoena
had
already
been
served.
the
bench
warrant
just
really
says,
you
know,
you
come
right
now.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ford.
the
case
is
submitted.
