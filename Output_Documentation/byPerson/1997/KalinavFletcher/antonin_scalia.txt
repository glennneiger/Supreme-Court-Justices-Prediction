what
about
the
other
side
of
the--
--that
had
nothing
to
do
with
functional
distinctions.
the
common
law
distinction
was
between
giving
evidence
and
initiating
a
prosecution.
there
was
civil
liability
for
wrongful
initiation
of
a
prosecution.
there
was
no
civil
liability
for
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
the
explanation
of
that
case,
not
the
functional
distinction
that
our
cases
have,
i
think,
mistakenly
applied,
mistakenly
if
we
think
we're
tracking
what
the
common
law
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
wasn't
defamation
liability,
as
the
perjured
testimony
would
be.
it
was
liability
for
malicious
prosecution,
essentially,
right?
