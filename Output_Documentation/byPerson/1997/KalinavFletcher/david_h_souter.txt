justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
maleng,
is
it
the
case
here
that
the
certification
could
have
been
executed
by
a
police
officer?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
i
understand
that.
if
a
police
officer
did
prepare
a
certification,
i
take
it
on
your
view
the
police
officer
would
also
be
subject
to
an
absolute
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
how
is
that
possible
under
what
i
understand
to
be
the
functional
approach,
and
the
functional
approach
that
your
argument
assumed,
and
that
was
that
it
was
the
function,
not
the
officer,
with
respect
to
which
the
immunity
decision
is
made?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
he's
performing
the
same
function
and,
i
mean,
the
theory
of
the
way
the
common
law
practice
is
applied
to
immunity
doctrine
is,
we
look
to
the
function
and
see
whether
that
function
at
common
law
was
subject
to
an
immunity.
now
if,
on
that
standard,
the
prosecutor
gets
absolute
immunity,
then
it's...
i
think
it
necessarily
follows
that
the
police
officer
would
get
absolute
immunity.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't...
i
guess,
explain
that
to
me.
i
don't
see
why,
because
i
thought
we
judged...
we
judge
the
function
without
respect
to
the
officer,
so
why
are
they
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
nature
and
function
of
the
act
here
is
the
provision
of
information
under
oath,
with
whatever
probability
of
soundness
that
oath
carries,
on
the
basis
of
which
a
magistrate
is
going
to
issue
an
arrest
warrant.
that
function,
it
seems
to
me,
is
exactly
the
same
whether
it's
performed
by
a
police
officer
or
whether
it's
performed
by
a
prosecutor.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
maleng,
i
think
you're
doing...
making
the
following
assumption
in
your
argument,
and
i'd
like
you
to
comment
on
it.
the
issue,
i
guess...
one
way
to
put
the
issue
here
is,
how
do
we
characterize
this
function
of
providing
the
certification?
do
we
characterize
it
in
a
very
narrow
and
specific
sense
of
providing
the
certification,
period...
we
carve
that
out...
or
do
we
characterize
it
as
part
of
a
broader
process,
the
process
of
initiating
a
prosecution?
if
we
characterize
it
in
the
narrow
sense,
merely
providing,
in
effect,
evidence
under
oath,
then
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
anything
peculiar
about
that
function
to
prosecutors.
police
officers
can
do
it.
if
we
characterize
it
in
the
broad
sense
and
say,
oh,
it's
just
a
part
of
initiating
a
prosecution,
then
we're
talking
about
a
function
that
prosecutors
do
and
that
prosecutors,
generally
speaking,
get
absolute
immunity
for,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
when
we
ask
you
the
question,
how
do
you
characterize,
you
shift
back
and
forth,
and
i
don't
think
we...
i
mean,
we
really
can't
shift
back
and
forth.
i
would
have
thought
that
the
reason
for
characterizing
it
narrowly
was
the
malley
case.
in
the
malley
case,
generally
speaking
it's
prosecutors
that
get
search
warrants,
but
witnesses
who
come
forward
to
provide
evidence
for
those
search
warrants
don't
get
absolute
immunity,
and
i
would
have
thought
that
there
was
an
analogy
there
to
this
situation.
prosecutors
get
arrest
warrants,
but
prosecutors
don't
necessarily
provide
evidence.
so
it
would
have
seemed
to
me
that
the
malley
case
was
a
reason
to
characterize
the
function
narrowly
as
presenting
evidence,
as
opposed
to
characterizing
the
function
broadly
as
just
a
little
part
of
going
after
or
getting
a
search
warrant
and
starting
a
prosecution.
is
my
argument
wrong
about
the
application
of
malley
in
deciding
whether
you
take
the
narrow
view
or
the
broad
view?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
malley
took
the
narrow
view
on
the
way
you
and
i
are
using
the
terms,
didn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
the
malley
case
said,
when
you're
getting
a
search
warrant,
which
is
essentially
a
prosecutorial
kind
of
function,
the
witness,
the
police
witness
does
not
get
an
absolute
immunity,
and
it
seems
to
me
there's
an
analogy
here.
prosecutors
initiate
prosecutions.
they
get
the
official
ball
rolling,
and
one
incident
of
that
is
getting
the
arrest
warrant,
but
it's
the
provision
of
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
the
arrest
warrant
issues
that
seems
to
be
analogous
to
the
provision
of
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
the
search
warrant
issues,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
malley
took
the
narrow
view,
and
my
question
is,
why
shouldn't
we,
for
consistency
reasons,
take
the
narrow
view
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
prosecutors
are
not
characteristically
witnesses.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
that
were
done,
would
there
be
probable
cause,
a
basis
for
probable
cause
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
mean,
on
that
theory
the
prosecutor
comes
up
and
says,
look,
i
really
don't
know
anything
about
this,
but
these
people
out
here
are
telling
me
that
it
is
so,
and
i'm
not
warranting
to
you
that
they're
right.
i'm
just
telling
you
what
i've
got
in
the
file.
would
that
be
a
sufficient
predicate
for
probable
cause
for
fourth
amendment
purposes?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
the
magistrate
has
got
to
make...
whoever
issues
the
warrant--
justice
david
h.
souter
--has
got
to
make
a
determination
of
fact.
can
a
magistrate
make
a
determination
of
fact
sufficient
for
constitutional
purposes
when
the
only
thing
the
magistrate
has
before
him
is
a
statement
from
somebody
saying,
i
really
don't
know
anything
about
this,
but
there
are
some
people
out
there
who
happen
to
think
the
following
propositions
are
true.
would
that
be
enough
for
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
when
you
meet
it
with
hearsay
evidence
you
in
effect
are
warranting
that
you
believe
the
hearsay
is
correct,
and
that
there
is
a
sufficient
basis
for
doing
it,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
prosecutor
can't
have
it
both
ways.
the
prosecutor
can't
say,
look,
i'm
not
a
witness
here,
therefore
i
get
absolute
immunity
for
whatever's
done,
and
at
the
same
time
satisfy
fourth
amendment
standards
for
providing
evidence
on
the
basis
of
which
probable
cause
is
found
by
an
independent
magistrate.
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
as
you
rightly
say,
or
rightly
indicate,
i
mean,
the
issuance
of
a
search
warrant
is
the
beginning
of
a
judicial
proceeding,
too,
and
i
assume
that
your
argument
assumes
that
there
is
a
historic...
given
the
way
we
go
about
the
immunity
question
that
there
is
a
basis
in
historical
practice
for
distinguishing
between
the
immunity
that
seems
to
be
implied
by
the
initiation
of
the
one
judicial
process,
search
warrants,
and
the
other
judicial
process,
arrest
warrant
and
filing
of
charges.
is
there,
and
where
would
i
find
the
historical
basis
for
drawing
the
line
where
you
would
have
us
draw
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
implication
of
what
you're
saying
that
malley
was
wrongly
decided.
justice
david
h.
souter
would
your
argument
be
different
if
we
were
dealing
with
a
state
in
which
the
historical
practice
had
been
traditionally
that
the...
what
is
called
the
certification
here,
the
statement
under
oath
about
fact,
was
given
by
police
officers
and
investigators
as
opposed
to
prosecutors?
would
your
argument
be
different
then,
or
would
your
conclusion
be
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
so,
the
witness
would
get
the
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there
is
the
chief
justice's
case.
let's
assume
the
prosecutor
says,
now,
i
issued
a
subpoena,
and
the
subpoena
doesn't,
i
take
it,
require
probable
cause
to
believe
that
anything
had
been
done
wrong
by
the
witness.
he
simply
says,
you
are
a
witness
who
can
give
evidence.
the
witness
hasn't
showed
up.
therefore,
issue
an
arrest
warrant.
the
cause
for
the
arrest
warrant
consists
of
the
failure
to
respond
to
a
lawfully
issued
subpoena.
if
the
prosecutor
is
lying
in
that
case,
then
i
would
suppose
on
your
theory
the
prosecutor
could
be
liable,
or
at
least...
strike
that...
would
not
have
any
absolute
immunity
even
though
in
fact
the
process
was
issued
in
the
middle
of
a
prosecution.
