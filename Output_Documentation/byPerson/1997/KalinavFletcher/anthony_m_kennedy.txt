justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
she
goes
on
to
sign
it
under
penalty
of
perjury,
which
i
understand
she's
not
required
to
do,
or
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
may
be
what
this
whole
case
is
about.
--in
other
words,
she
can
say,
consistently
with
your
procedure,
i
have
reviewed
the
police
report
and,
based
on
the
police
report,
i
believe
the
facts
to
be
as
follow...
the
following,
and
then
sign
it
under
penalty
of
perjury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
suffices?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
that
instance
is
there
an
underlying
sworn
affidavit
from
the
police
officer?
does
somebody
swear
to
something?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
is
the
practice
in
most
felony
cases
that
the
prosecutor
makes
this
summary
and
the
certification
under
oath?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
prevail
can
prosecutors
maintain
their
absolute
immunity
in
further
cases
by
adopting
that
sort
of
formulation,
of
being
just
a
little
bit
more
careful?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
they
swear
that
i
have
read
the
police
report
and
based
on
the
police
report
there's
probably
cause
for
the
following,
and
then
there's
a
police
affidavit
as
well?
