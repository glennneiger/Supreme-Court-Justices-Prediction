mr.
mark
w.
barnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
case
that
is
before
the
court
today
involves
the
question
of
whether
an
1894
act
of
congress
had
the
intent
and
the
effect
of
disestablishing
the
yankton
sioux
reservation.
the
state
submits
that
the
answer
is
conclusively
yes.
and
we
base
that
"yes"
on
several
factors,
the
first
and
not
least
of
which
is
the
use
of
"cession
and
sum
certain"
language
in
the
operative...
or
terms...
in
the
operative
section
of
the
agreement
and
the
ratifying
act.
that
particular
"cession
and
sum
certain",
the
cession,
sale,
relinquishment
and
conveyance
of
all
interests
in
and
to
the
unalloted
land,
together
with
the
sum
certain,
has
been
held
by
this
court
to
create
an
almost
insurmountable
presumption,
or
a
nearly
conclusive
presumption.
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that,
in
combination
with
the
immediate
uptake
of
jurisdiction
by
the
state
of
south
dakota
in
1895,
and
continuously
uncontested
state
jurisdiction
during
the
next
100
years,
and
throwing
that
together
with
the
fact
that
that
jurisdiction
was
exercised
without
objection
by
the
tribe
and
without
an
attempt
to
exercise
jurisdiction
by
the
tribe
or
the
federal
government
throughout
those
100
years,
and
that's
not
merely
our
contention
but
that
also
is
the
observation...
excuse
me...
of
both
the
eighth
circuit
and
the...
both
the
majority
and
dissenting
opinion,
as
well
as
the
opinion
of
the
unanimous
state
of
south
dakota
supreme
court.
and
then,
add
into
that,
as
a
method
of
telling
us
what
everybody
understood
at
the
time
that
this
act
was
passed,
pursuant
to
the
agreement
with
the
yankton
tribe,
was
what
i
will
call
the
immediate
wholesale
settlement
of
the
area
by
homesteaders,
or
what
the
district
court
referred
to
as
the
rapid
settlement
and
the
loss...
the
quick
loss
of
indian
character
in
this
area,
which
would
suggest,
at
least
to
the
state,
that
that
would
suggest
disestablishment.
we
also
would
submit
to
you
that
additional--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
diminishment
probably
should
be
read
to
suggest
a
case
more
like
rosebud
v.
kneip,
where
the
court
said
that
as
to
several
counties,
the
reservation
was
disestablished,
but
it
still
left
one
county
with
a
compact
square
of
reservation.
and
so
there
was
still
actually
18
u.s.c.,
1151(a)-type
reservation
country
out
there,
but
it
was
diminished
in
size.
the
case
that
we
have
here
today...
and
i
think
the
parties
would
agree...
that
the
case
we
are
doing
today
is
disestablishment,
just
like
the
decoteau
case,
where
the
lake
traverse
reservation
was
found
by
this
court
to
be
disestablished,
meaning
there
was
still
no
1151-type--1151(a)-type
reservation
out
there.
i...
i
might
add,
your
honor,
that
diminishment
and
disestablishment
at
one
time
were
probably
not
terms
of
art.
in
our
view,
they
are
now.
and
we
are,
i
think,
today
here
litigating
disestablishment.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes.
and
i...
and
i
do
not
believe,
from
reading
all
of
judge
magill's
opinion,
that
he's
trying
to
suggest
that
some
1151(a)-type
reservation
still
existed
after
1894.
i
think,
to
be
honest,
i
would
suggest
to
you
that...
that
he
was
probably
using
diminishment
and
disestablishment
interchangeably,
and
that
has
happened
in
the
history
of
the...
of
the
court
system
in
other
cases
as
well.
returning
for
a
moment,
if
i
may,
to
the
settlement
history
that
took
place
out
there...
and
the
reason
i
bring
it
up
is
because
this
court,
on
other
occasions,
has
looked
to
the
settlement
history
immediately
after
the
passage
of
the
opening
act
to
help
it
determine
what
did
everybody
understand
at
the
time.
and
in
this
case,
as
was
suggested
by
the
court
of
claims
in
1980...
or
as
was
found
by
that
court...
within
3
years
of
the
opening
of
this
reservation,
more
than
100,000
of
these
opened
acres
had
been
sold.
within
5
years,
90
percent
had
been
sold.
and
as
you
will
see
at
joint
appendix
475,
by
1913,
in
addition
to
the
ceded
lands
which
had
been
put
up
for
settlement
by
the
homesteaders,
more
than
twothirds
of
the
allotted
lands
left
to
the
indians
in
1894
had
also
been
sold.
and
so--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--yes,
your
honor,
we
do
contend
that
it
was
restored
to
the
public
domain.
and
by
way
of
explanation,
at
the
time
of
trial,
90
percent
of
all
of
the
land
in
what
we
call
the
disputed
area,
90
percent
of
that
former
reservation
area
was
in
nonindian
hands.
which
has
been
something
that
the
court
has
noted
in
its
prior
cases.
and
more
than
twothirds,
or
68
percent,
of
the
population
was
nonindian,
as
found
by
the
federal
census.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
168,000
acres
of
the
430...
168,000
were
immediately
ceded
to
the
federal
government,
and
then,
then,
as
i
said,
began
a
rapid
process
of
sale.
and
then
the
allotments,
which
were
the
balance
of
the
430,
were,
in
large
part,
sold
in
the
ensuing
years.
in
about
the
next
15
or
20
years,
a
great
majority
of
the
allotments
were
sold.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
oh,
okay.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
excuse
me,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
it
was...
it
was...
it
is
now
and
was
at
the
time
of
trial
fee
land.
it
was
issued
by
a
government
patent,
issued
by
the
federal
government.
i
don't
know
the
exact
year,
but
i'm
going
to
suggest
in
the
late
1800's.
and
i
can
find
that
fact
in
time
for
rebuttal.
but
it
was
issued
in...
in
fee
patent
by
the
federal
government,
and
used
actually
the
words
"public
domain"
in
that
fee
patent.
and
so--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--that
i
cannot
answer.
i'd
be
guessing,
your
honor.
i
do
have
that
information,
but
i
don't
have
it
at
my
fingertips.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
the...
as
we
look
at
article
xviii,
it
seems
to
the
state
that
the
one
thing
that
you
cannot
do
with
article
xviii
is
read
it
literally.
because
if
you
read
it
literally,
in
the
strict
literal
interpretation,
then
it
says
that
nothing
in
this
act
in
effect...
or
in
agreement...
in
1892
actually
happened.
the
sale
did
not
happen.
the
white
homesteaders
could
not
move
in.
part
of
the
1858
treaty
forbade
settlers
or
other
whites
from
coming
onto
the
reservation,
with
certain
narrow
exceptions.
and
that
was
in
1858.
by
contrast,
in
the
1892,
and
in
the
act
ratifying
it,
the
exact
opposite
purpose
was
there,
that...
that
we
are
going
to
have
whites
come
in
and
settle
this
area.
and...
and
so,
when
we
try
to
interpret
what
article
xviii
says,
i
think,
first,
that
the...
and
i
suspect
the
parties
would
even
agree...
it
cannot
be
read
literally.
because
then
you
get
absurd
results.
the
second
thing
that
i
would
observe
about
article
xviii
is
that
if
you
read
the
first
sentence
of
article
xviii,
it
says
nothing
in
this
treaty
abrogates
the
1858
treaty...
or
nothing
in
this
agreement.
if
that's
true,
all
the
rest
of
article
xviii
is
surplus.
if
you
go
to
the
first
phrase
in
the
second
sentence,
it
repeats
that
phrase,
that...
that
essential
statement.
and
if
that's
true,
what
came
before
and
what
came
after
is
surpluses.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it
can't
be
read
literally.
and...
and
that
takes
us
to
the
next
point,
which
is,
how
does
the
federal
government
propose
to
us
that
it
should...
or
to
you...
that
it
should
be
read?
and
if
i
understand
their
argument
in
their
briefs
correctly,
they're
suggesting
that
you
need
to
read
into
article
xviii
the
phrase
"not
inconsistent".
and
they
go
to
article
i
and
ii
and
suggest
that
i
and
ii
is
not
really
a
cession
and
sum
certain,
contrary
to
its
express
language,
but
is...
and,
in
fact,
i
would
submit
to
you
they
are
asking
you
to
read
out
cession
and
sum
certain.
and
take
that
out,
and
then
construe
what
is
left.
and...
and
i
don't
think
that
that
is
the
appropriate
way
to
handle
it.
and,
in
fact,
i
would...
i
would
suggest
that
the
klamath
case
had
an
analogous
situation,
where
there
was
a
savings
clause
in
that
case,
which
suggested
that
nothing
in
the...
in
the
more
modern
agreement
was
to...
was
to
take
away
rights
they
had
preserved
in
the
past.
but
as
the
klamath
court
pointed
out,
the
later
agreement
constituted
a
cession
and
sum
certain,
and
that
the
klamath
tribe
could
not
silently
preserve
hunting
and
fishing
rights
through
a
general...
the
general
language
of
a
savings
clause.
now,
i
would
also
submit
to
the
court
that
when
we
look
at
18,
at
the
tail
end
of
this
agreement,
or
when
you
look
at
it...
excuse
me...
i
would
suggest
to
you
that
it
is
important
that
that
is
not
the
operative
language
of
the...
of
the
agreement
or
the
act.
and,
in
fact,
i
would...
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
hagen
case,
where
the
court
said
that,
in
observing
on
the
solem
case,
observed
that
the
use
of
the
words
"public
domain"
in
the
solem
case
were
not
found
in
the
operative
language
of
the
act.
and
since
they
were
not
found
in
the
operative
language,
they
had,
i
think,
secondary
importance.
or
as
the
court--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--in
the
1892?
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
because
i
don't
think
they
intended
to
disestablish...
excuse
me...
i
think
they
intended
to
disestablish,
and
i
don't
think
that...
that
they
intended
article
xviii
to...
to
change
what
the
terms
or
the
operative
intent
of
the
act
were.
i
think
that
article
xviii
was
there
to
reassure
the
tribe
that
they
would
receive
the
monies
and
the
claims
that
they
felt
were
due
them...
the
annuities.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
well,
i
think,
as
one
justice
said...
or
judge
said...
at
the
eighth
circuit,
lawyers
repeat
themselves.
and
i
suspect
that...
that
probably
what
was
happening
was
the
indians
were
concerned
that...
that
the
federal
government
was
not
going
to
live
up
to
its
obligations,
and
particularly
when
they
understood
they
were
selling
the...
the
remaining
reservation
that
they
had
received
in
the
1858
treaty,
it
seems
to
me
that
a
fair
question
that
would
have
been
in
the
indians
minds
was
are
you
going
to
abrogate
that
portion
of
the
1858
treaty
from
which
our
annuities
flow?
and
the
answer
would
be
no,
we
are
not
going
to
abrogate
the
1858
treaty,
and
you
will
get
your
annuities.
and,
indeed,
if
you
look
at
the
report
that
the
commissioner
gave
to
the
state
of
interior,
who
then
filed
with
the
congress,
in
1893,
what
you
will
see
is
a...
is
a
lengthy
description
in
the
record
about
what
all
of
the
indians
concerns
were
and
how
these
were
resolved
in
the
various
articles
of
the
agreement.
and
so
there
was
a
long
discussion
about
pipestone
quarry
and
a
long
discussion
about
scout
claims
for
indians
who
had
served
as
scouts
and
felt
they
still
had
money
owing.
a
lot
of
discussion
about
their
concerns.
no
discussion
about
preserving
boundaries
or
authority,
in
the
first
place.
and
in
the
second
place,
when
we
come
to...
to
what
the
negotiator
is
telling
congress
the
indians
feel
about
18,
it
gets
one
sentence,
and
one
sentence
only
in
the
record.
and
what
he
says
is...
with
regard
to
18,
his
comment
is
the
treaty
of
1858
is
not
abrogated
and
the
indians
shall
get
their
annuities.
and
so
that
suggests
to
me
that...
that
if
the
tribe
really
did
think
and
believe
that
they
were
going
to
preserve
their
boundaries
and
their
authority,
number
one,
that's
a
glaring
conflict
with
the
cession
and
sum
certain
language;
and,
number
two,
is
completely
unsupported
in
the
congressional
and
in
the
negotiating
record.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
well,
i
read
that
reference
as
a
geographical
reference.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
and...
and...
and
through...
and
the
use
of
the
phrase
"within
the
reservation"--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--does
not
suggest
to
us...
given
the
fact
that
it's
right
in
a
cession
and
sum
certain
does
not
suggest
to
us
that
a
reservation
is
going
to
continue.
it
is
simply
a
reference
to
what
area
it
is
that
we
are
ceding
and
disestablishing.
and
i
would
call
your
attention
to
the
decoteau
case,
with
the
lake
traverse
sissetons
and
titowan
tribe,
identical
article
i
and
ii,
word
for
word.
and
it
used
the
same
phrase,
"within
the
reservation".
and
yet
this
court
held,
as
you
know,
that
that
reservation
was
disestablished.
and
i
would
also
submit
to
you,
your
honor,
that...
that
this
is
consistent
with
what
the
indians
have
understood
for
the
first
100
years,
as
evidenced
by
their
own
constitutions,
particularly
the
1962
constitution,
which
tells
us
something
about
what
the
indians
felt.
in
1962,
the
territory
that
they
claimed...
this
is
in
your
joint
appendix
at
499...
the
only
territory
they
claim
jurisdiction
over
in
their
own
constitution
was,
quote,
tribal
lands
now
owned
by
the
tribe,
end
quote.
which
we
think
is
a
lot
more
consistent
than
what
is--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--yes.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
correct.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
we
are
also
arguing
that--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
believe
that
we
are
adhering
to
the
teaching
of
the
decoteau
case,
where
the
decoteau
case,
at
420
u.s.,
446,
in
footnote
2,
talks
about
when
you
cede
the
authority,
the
governmental
authority,
that
you
have
over
an
area...
and...
or,
in
this
case,
to
use
the
exact
language...
cede
all
interest...
with
that
goes
the
authority
not
just
over
the
immediately
ceded,
but
in
the
entire
region.
and,
indeed,
in
the
decoteau
case,
the
court
said
that
what
was
intended
to
be
left
by
congress
was
the
allotted
lands...
the
allotted
and
trust
lands.
and
under
the
pelican
case
and
under
18
u.s.c.,
1151(a),
(b)
and
(c),
what
we
know
today
is
that
when
there
is
a
cession
and
sum
certain,
the
authority
is
lost.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
we
subscribe
to
the
decoteau
logic,
that...
that,
i
think,
suggested
that
congress'
intent
was
that
the
cession
means
all
authority--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--what
was
lost
at
the
time
was
1151(a)-type
jurisdiction.
and
to
go
back
to
the
solem
case,
the
common
notion
at
that
time,
in
those
years,
was
that
tribal...
tribal
ownership
was
synonymous
with
tribal
authority.
and
so,
then,
when
lands
went
out
of
tribal
ownership,
they
lost
that
authority.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes.
and...
and...
and
my
point,
your
honor,
is
that
then,
as
those
allotted
lands
are
alienated,
the
indian
title
becomes
extinguished.
to
use
the
exact
language
of
18
u.s.c.,
1151(c),
the
indian
title
is
extinguished.
and
at
that
time,
under
the
decoteau
case
and
under
a
long
line
of
cases
in
the
lower
federal
courts,
as
well
as,
i
think,
the...
the
cases
from
this
court,
then
that
is...
that
also
loses
its
status
as--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--well,
i
think...
and
that's
a
reference
to
the
1941
cohen
opinion...
but
let
me
observe
that
even
felix
cohen,
as
an
advocate
and
as
a,
i
believe,
acting
solicitor,
even
he
did
not
base
his
opinion
on
article
xviii
when
he...
when
he
reviewed
this.
secondly,
the
very
next
year,
he
offered
the
perrin
case
as
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
tribes...
that...
that
this
was
now
no
longer
reservation
land.
and
so
that
certainly
was
an
indication.
but
perhaps
a
better
indication
would
be
to...
to
look
at
how
did
the
federal
government
and
the
tribe
view
this
very
question.
because
on
all
of
those
lands
which
were
allotted
and
then
later
alienated...
almost
all
of
them
by
1913...
we've
been
out
since
1913...
or
in
all
of
those
years...
exercising
jurisdiction,
without
contest
or
objection
from
the
tribe
until
about
3
years
ago.
and
then
you
look
at
felix
cohen
issued
his
opinion
in
1941.
and
if
that
was
not
a
wakeup
call
to
the
federal
government
and
the
tribe
that
maybe
you've
got
more
jurisdiction
on
those
lands
which
once
were
allotted,
certainly
congress'
enactment
in
1948...
if
this
was
still
all
reservation,
both
the
original
cession
land
and
the
allotted
lands
that
were
alienated...
that
should
have
been
a
wakeup
call.
and
still
we
did
not
see
the
federal
government.
and
even
as
late
as
1985,
the
federal
government
was
arguing
in
the
eighty
circuit
court
of
appeals
that...
or
suggesting...
that
this
reservation
in
fact
was
diminished.
so--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--it...
it
used
the
words
"all
unalloted
land".
now,
there
are--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
think
it
has
an
effect.
it
applies--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
would
agree.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
well,
i
think
it's
a
reflection,
your
honor,
of
when
we
look
at
1151(a),
(b)
and
(c),
those
are
a
codification
of
law
that
had
been
developing
ever
since
the...
i
believe
the
bates
v.
clark
case
back
in
the
1870's.
and
i
think
what
the
courts
have
said
as
they've
looked
at
this
question
is,
is
that,
did
congress
intend
to
disestablish
the
reservation?
and
if
it
did
intend
to
disestablish
the
reservation,
then
the
courts
have
been
uniform,
they
have
been
uniform
in
concluding
that
not
only
is
there
a
loss
of
authority
or
jurisdiction
as
to
the
lands
immediately
ceded,
but
they
are
also
taking
the
position...
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
philosophy
of
the
allotment
act,
the...
in
the
yakima
v.
yakima
indian
nation
case...
the
court
has
expressed,
in
justice
scalia's
writings...
talks
about
the
policy
of
the
allotment
act.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
and
the...
the...
and
i
think
you
have
to
read
that
within...
or
as
a
historical
context
throughout
the
late
1800's
and
into
the
first
decade
of
the...
of
the
1900's.
and
that
is
that
the...
the...
the
goal
and
the
purpose
of
these
cession
and
sum
certain
cases,
the
goal
of
congress
was
to
erase
the
boundaries--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
would...
that
would
certainly
be
a
more
difficult
case.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
theoretically...
yes,
theoretically,
that's
correct,
if...
and
i...
and
i...
i
have
to
add
an
"if",
based
on
the
hagen
teaching...
which
is
look
at
all
of
the
circumstances.
if,
in
the
operative
language
of
the
act,
which
was
the
case
here,
"cession
and
sum
certain",
if
that
language
is
used,
and
if
from
all
of
the
other
circumstances
that
apply...
the
rapid
settlement,
the
uptake
of
jurisdiction--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--okay.
well,
and
so
yours
is
a
more
difficult
case,
obviously.
this
was
only--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--yes.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes.
and...
and,
to
go
back
to
the--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--understood.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
to
go
back
to
what
decoteau
tells
us,
that
that
cession
and
sum
certain
is
conveying
governmental
authority,
and
it
is
eliminating
the
boundaries
in
the
entire
quadrant.
and
what
is
left
is
the
allotments
which...
and
the
dependent
indian
communities.
and
so
we
are
not
contesting
today
that
we
have
jurisdiction
over
that
9
percent.
we're
suggesting
we
have
1151(a)
jurisdiction
over
the
90
percent
that
is
not
in
indian
hands.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
that
tract
has
never
been
allotted
lands.
but
to
say...
but
i
would
have
to
respectfully
disagree
with
the
justice
that
we
are
not
simply
arguing
over
that
one
tract.
because
that
part
is...
whether
or
not
there
is
going
to
be
a
site
there
is
not
on
appeal
here.
what's
on
appeal
is
the
district
judge's
opinion
that
there
is
still...
that...
that
broad
boundaries
are
out
there
which
create
1151(a)
jurisdiction
in
the
entire
region,
including
the
90
percent.
and...
and
let
me
just
close
so
i
can
reserve
a
little
bit
of
time.
i
would
suggest
to
you
this
if
the
federal
government
and
the
tribe
read
this
act
the
way
they
do
now,
where
have
they
been?
if
it
could
be
easily
and
reasonably
read
that
way,
why
wasn't
it?
thank
you.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
well--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--i
think
we
lose
a
vast
amount
of
clarity,
as
we
are
standing...
or,
up
until
the
district
court
opinion,
jurisdiction
in
the
90
percent
of
this
area
that
has
gone
out
of
indian
hands
was--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--well,
obviously,
if
you
were
to
hold
that
it
is
still
a
reservation
in
this
entire
area,
it
would
have
a
big
effect
on
criminal
jurisdiction.
and
the
best
example
i
can
give
you
is
that
if
you
were
the
victim
of
a
crime
out
there
on
that
90
percent
of
that
area,
it's
the
difference
between
whether
you
call
the
sheriff
down
the
road
or
whether
you
call
the
fbi
office
120
miles
east
of
there,
in
sioux
falls,
and
leave
a
message
on
the
machine.
second--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--pardon
me?
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
yes,
i
think
there
would
be.
you're
on
a
reservation
at
that
point,
and
i
think
there
would
be
criminal
aspects,
because
of
18--
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
--yes,
there
would
be.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
well,
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
holdings
of
this
court
that
suggest
that...
that
if
there
is
a
reservation
out
there,
the
tribe
is
going
to
have
some
rights
of
civil
jurisdiction.
and,
indeed,
in
this
case,
when
they
first
now
started
claiming
that
they
have
civil
jurisdiction,
they're
in
trying
to
contest
fee
land...
fee
land
landfill
that
isn't
even
on
trust
land.
mr.
mark
w.
barnett
suffice
it
to
say,
your
honor,
with
the...
and...
and
i'm
trying
to
be
brief
to
stay
within
my
time...
but
suffice
it
to
say
that
this
court
is
aware
that
there
would
be
all
sorts
of
ramifications
that
the
court
has
seen
in
prior
cases
in
disputes
over
civil
jurisdiction,
a-1
being
one
place
where
we've
had
to
litigate
who's
in
charge.
let
me
just
clarify
something
else.
in
this
act,
there
was
no
tribal
land
base
left.
yet
there
was
a
little
reserve
of
federal
land,
for
the
1
mile
square,
but
everything
else
was
allotments.
and
so
tribal
communal
ownership
was
over.
secondly,
there
were
savings
clauses
in
montana,
in
the
montana
crow
agreements,
and
in
the
rosebud
agreement.
and
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
hook
in
the
argument
that
they're
suggesting
that
a
nonoperative
savings
clause,
with
no
specific
language
about
preserving
some
authority
and
no
contemporary
history...
my
time
is
up.
thank
you.
