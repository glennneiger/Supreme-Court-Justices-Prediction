mr.
james
g.
abourezk
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
the
1858
treaty...
and
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
that,
if
i
may...
the
tribe
gave
up
11
million
acres
of
land
to
the
united
states
government.
these
were
enormous
property
rights
and
sovereignty
rights
that
they
bargained
away
in
exchange
for
a
430,000-acre
homeland,
a
reservation
that
they
believed
was
going
to
be
their
permanent
home
in
perpetuity.
they...
they
also
got
annuities.
they
got
some
cash...
i
think
1.6
million
dollars.
but
this
430,000
acres
was
their
land
that
they
wanted
to
retain
the
indian
character.
they
wanted
to
retain
this
land
forever.
and
when
the
government
came
along,
after
the
allotments
in
1892,
and
said
we
want
to
buy
what's
left
over
from
you,
the
surplus
lands,
the
tribe
held
on
so
dearly
to
this
1858
treaty,
to
their
boundaries,
to
the
reservation
and
their
annuities
that
they
refused
actually
to
sign
the
1892
agreement
until
the
federal
government
said,
okay,
we're
going
to
give
you
article
xviii,
we'll
give
you
school
lands,
we'll
give
you
the
liquor
provision
that
you've
asked
for.
these
were
things
demanded
by
the
tribe.
and
they
got
them.
and,
as
you
know,
they
were
handed
a
form
agreement
by
the
government,
the
tribe
was,
that
had
actually
six...
six
articles
in
it.
and
everything
else
was
tagged
on...
in...
insisted
upon
by
the
tribe.
now,
the
state
has
been
arguing
disestablishment
and
diminishment.
and
they
use
the
terms
interchangeably.
they
have
in
their
briefs.
and
what
they're
really
asking
for
is
not
just
diminishment,
which
would
be
the
case
justice
breyer
brought
up,
that
would
be
carving
out
a
discrete
portion
or
a
discrete
parcel
of
the
reservation
and
saying,
okay,
this
is
now
no
longer
here,
so
the
reservation
boundaries
are
diminished.
no,
what
the
state
is
asking
for...
and
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
in
their...
in
their
writings...
is
termination,
total
termination
of
the
reservation
altogether.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
in
what...
in
what
regard,
justice
scalia?
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes,
it
would
be.
although
the
reason
you
can't
really
argue
diminishment
in
this
respect...
and
that's
why
they
don't
really
say
diminishment...
is
that
the
parcels
were
checkerboarded
all
the
way...
the
allotment
parcels
are
checkerboarded
all
the
way
through,
as
well
as
the
ceded
portions.
they're
everywhere
within
the
southern
half
of
charles
mix
county.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
or
nothing.
that's
what
they're
asking
for.
because
you
can't
really
diminish
that
reservation.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
precisely.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
well,
it
would--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--i
think
it
was
one...
this
court
at
one
point
said
that
if
that
were
the
case...
first
of
all,
it's
looked
upon
with
disfavor;
but,
secondly,
they
would
say
law
enforcement
people
would
have
to
have
a
map
to
decide
who
they
can
arrest
and
where.
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
leave
a
checkerboard
reservation.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes.
absolutely.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
well,
that
would
never
happen.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
first
of
all,
the
federal
government
and
the
tribe
have
been
exercising
jurisdiction
ever
since
the
eighth
circuit
opinion.
and
the
state
now
cannot
arrest
indians
on
indian
land
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
if
we
were
to
win
this...
if
the
tribe
were
to
win
the
case,
really
nothing
would
change.
it
would
be
such
a
minimal
change
that
it
wouldn't--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--oh,
of
course,
yes.
yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
there's
a
county
government.
there
are...
there
are
city
govern...
town
governments
in
each
one
of
these
towns.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
only...
only
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation
and
only
with
regard
to
indian
defendants
in
criminal
cases.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
the
normal
rules
of
south
dakota--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--south
dakota.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
sorry,
say
that
last
word
again?
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
south
dakota
law.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
that's
right.
the
only
exception,
justice
breyer,
is
if
a
nonindian
were
to
commit
a
crime
against
an
indian
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation,
the
federal
courts
would
take
jurisdiction
over
that.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes.
the...
the
nonindians
would
not
be
allowed
to
use
the
court
unless
they
would
both
submit
to
its
jurisdic...
the
tribal
court...
unless
they
submitted
to
its
jurisdiction.
and
i
think
the
only
difference--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--no,
it
will
make
no
difference...
minimal
difference
to
the
nonindian
population.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
the
permit...
the
permit
wasn't--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--no,
the
permit
wasn't
denied.
it
was...
first
of
all,
they
brought
a...
it
was
an
administrative
hearing
in
the
state...
in
the
state
administrative
procedures,
asking
for
a
permit
from
the
state
of
south
dakota.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
no.
no,
we
don't
take
that
position.
the
position
we
took
was
that
because
the
state
could
not
permit
on
the
reservation,
that
the
epa
regulations
must
be
followed
then
instead
of
the
state
regulations,
which
are
weaker
than
epa's
regulations.
that
was
our--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--yes.
because
the
tribe
had
not
gotten
any
authority
to...
to
regulate
landfills
within
the
reservation.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
no.
the
reason
is
decisions
by
this
court,
that
provide
for
different
kinds
of
jurisdiction
over
different
people,
whether
indians
or
nonindians.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
i
don't
know
of
any,
if
there
are.
i
think
there
is
always--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--well,
justice--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--well,
there
is
in
this
case.
right
now,
the...
i
think
the
eighth
circuit
did
a
little
research
on
its
own,
independent
research,
showing
that
there
were
anywhere
from
32
to
44
percent
of
indian
population
in
the
county
within...
within
that
reservation.
so
there's
a
substantial--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--pardon?
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
right
now,
about
10
percent.
as
the
attorney
general
said,
about
90
percent
have
been
sold
off...
of
the
ceded
lands...
by...
and
were
purchased
by
other
people
that
are
not...
not
any
longer
tribal...
or
indian
lands,
yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
i
would
say
something
totally
different--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--your
honor.
what
i
would
say
is
that
congress
intended,
by
virtue
of
leaving
in
article
xviii
in
the...
in
the
1894
statute,
by
leaving
that
in,
they
certainly
intended
to
continue
tribal
governmental
authority
within
the
boundaries
of
the
reservation.
and
if
you
read
the
entire
agreement--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--no.
it
continues
the
treaty,
justice
scalia.
it
doesn't
take
away
any--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
well,
it
doesn't
really
say
that.
well,
i
think...
i
think
a
fair
reading--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--i
think--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
respectfully,
there's
only
one
change
made
in
the...
between
the
1858
treaty
and
the
'94
agreement,
where
there
was
a
conflict.
that...
and
section
10
of
the
treaty,
in
1858,
said
that
white
people...
they
didn't
use
the
word
"nonindian",
they
just
said
white
people
in
those
days...
cannot
enter
this
reservation
and
cannot
reside
here.
so
that's
the
only
conflicting
portion.
so
if
you
re...
with
statutory
construction,
you
passed
a
statute
in
1894--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--oh,
i
don't...
i
don't
agree
with
that,
justice
ginsburg.
because
if...
if
you
read
the
whole
entire
treaty
and
the
whole
entire
1894
statute,
i
think
it
clearly
shows
that...
that
the
whites...
they
could
sell
land
to
the
nonindians
and
nonindians
could
come
and
settle.
in
fact,
if
you
read
the
legislative
history
and
the
report
of
the
commissioners
who
negotiated
it,
they
say...
they
told
the
indians
that
we
would
like
whites
to
come
in
and
show
you
how
to
farm
and
their
upstanding
character...
moral
character,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
and
that's
what
we
would
like
to
do.
and
the
indians
bought
that.
and
they
said,
but
they
still
wanted
to
maintain
the
indian
character
of
their
reservation.
which
is
how
i
read
article
xviii
to
mean.
and
that's...
of
course,
that's
how
the
two
lower
courts
read
it
as
well.
and
you
take
the...
the
cession
and
sum
certain
language,
which
is...
in
my
view,
it's
just
boilerplate
in
all
of
those
agreements--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--no,
solem
said
if
you
take
those
two,
they're
almost...
or
nearly...
hagen
said
"nearly".
solem
said
"almost
irrebuttable
presumption".
but
if
you
read
the
entire
agreement
together,
i
say
the
presumption
falls
upon...
the
presumption
is
that
the
indians
retain
the
reservation
and
it's
up
to
the
state
to
rebut--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--well,
if
it
is
ambiguous,
it
should
be
decided
in
favor
of
the
tribe,
in
any
event.
according
to
this
court--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--well--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--justice
ginsburg,
if
you
read
the
entire
agreement
and
the
statute
of
1894,
what
my
position
is...
our
position
is
that
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
maintaining
the
reservation
boundaries
because
of
what
article
xviii,
article
xvii,
and
the
school--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--it's
not
only
rebutted,
but
it
shifts...
the
burden
of
proof
then
shifts
to
the
state
or
the
people
trying
to
abolish
the
reservation.
and
i
don't
think
they've
met
that
burden.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
but
you
also
said
in
solem
that
there
must
be
substantial
and
compelling
evidence
in
order
to
disestablish
or
diminish
a
reservation.
and
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
is
this
that
the...
the
evidence
is
not
there.
the
state
has
not
met
its
burden
to...
it
doesn't
show
any
substantial...
it
doesn't
show
any--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--if
that's
all
there
were.
but
there
is
more.
and
i
mean
more
by
article
xviii.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
oh,
i...
well,
of
course,
our
position
is
that
we
have
an
awful
lot
more.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
well,
we
take
that
position
simply
because
it's
not
practical
to...
to
diminish--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--we
don't
really,
because
it's
not
practical.
you
just
can't
do
it
because--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes,
they
are.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
that
there
is
still
some?
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
well,
they're
owned
by
individual
indians.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes.
yeah.
and
there...
there
are
some
tribal
lands,
but
mostly
it's
individual--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--no.
no.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
your
honor,
what...
what
happened
was
there
were...
the
allotments
were
over
200,000
acres
that
were
allotted
out.
what
was
left
over
was
160-some-thousand
acres.
that's
what
the
government
came
along
and
bought
in
1892.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes,
there
were.
but--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--i
must
have
misunderstood
his
question.
but
there
are...
there
were
tribal
lands
in
1894.
but
most
of
them
are
individual
indian
allotments,
owned
by
indians.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
yes,
very...
not
very
many...
not
very
many
acres,
but
there
are.
yes.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
there
were
all
in
the
tribe's
possession
prior
to
1892.
then--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--no.
no.
all
of
the
lands...
all
of
the
430,000
acres
were
communally
owned
until
the
allotments--
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
--around...
and
then...
then
what
was
left
over,
in
1892,
the
government
purchased.
that
was
160-some-thousand.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
well,
only
a
mile
square.
there
was
a
mile
square
they
retained
for
their
headquarters,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
mr.
james
g.
abourezk
thank
you.
