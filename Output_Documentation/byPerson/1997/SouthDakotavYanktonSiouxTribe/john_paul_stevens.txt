justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
this
question
about
article
i
and...
and
also
justice
ginsburg's
question
of
distinction
between
dis...
disestablishment
and...
and
diminishment.
that
when
you
say...
when
the
sentence
says
they
cede,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
their
interest
in
and
all
the
unalloted
lands
within
the
limits
of
the
reservation...
set
apart...
doesn't
that
kind
of
convey
a
message...
i
don't
know...
if
you
don't
know
the
geography...
that
there's
some
un...
unalloted
lands
within
the
limits
of
the
reservation
to
which
this
agreement
applies
and
there's
additional
land
in
the...
in
the
reservation
that's
unaffected
by
this?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--isn't
it
true,
though,
that
apart
from
the
savings
clause
and
the
negotiating
history,
if
you
just
look
at
the
text
of
the
document,
the
decoteau
case
is
just
like
this,
that
if
you
have...
let
me
just
finish
one
question
so
you
can
comment...
if
you
assume
that
if
everything
is
allotted,
you
don't
have
a
reservation.
and
if
you
then
assume
that
all
that's
left
is
unalloted
land,
but
then
you
cede
your
entire
authority
over
the
unalloted
lands,
what
can
be
left?
i
have
trouble
getting
your
explanation
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
the
differences
because
of
the
history
primarily
in
the
absence
of
the
savings
clause.
