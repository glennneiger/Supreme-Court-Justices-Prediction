justice
antonin
scalia
why...
why
isn't
this
in
the
operative
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
can...
can
i
ask
about
this
hypothetical.
i
assume
this
1
acre
is
the
only
acre
that
is...
is
not
previously
allotted.
all
the
rest
is
allotted
lands.
is
that
how
you
understood
the
hypothetical?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so...
so
the
tribe
has
given
away
all
of
its
unalloted
portion
in
the
reservation?
justice
antonin
scalia
as
far
as
this
parcel
at
issue
here
is
concerned,
does
it
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
is
only
a
diminishment
rather
than
a
disestablishment,
wouldn't
the
parcel
here
be
in
the
portion
that
was
diminished...
that
is,
it
was
taken
away
from
the
tribe?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it...
it
may...
it
may
be...
it
may
be
true
that...
that
the
way
people
thought
at
the
end
of
the
19th
century,
if
the
tribe,
as
a
tribe,
doesn't
own
anything
in
this
whole
area,
there
can't
be
a
reservation.
you
can't
have
a
reservation
composed
only
of
lands
that
are
owned
by
individual
indians.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
which
can
be...
can
be
alienated
to
nonindians.
you
have
to
have
at
least
some...
some
basic
component
of...
of
tribal
land
that's
owned
by
the
community
of
the
tribe.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
pick
out
that?
why
pick
out
that
one
element
from
the
whole
treaty
as
the
one
element
that...
that
article
xviii
preserves?
if
you
read
it
literally,
it...
it
just
takes
away
everything
that
the
whole
treaty
gives.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
the
1858
treaty,
it
continues.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
talking
about
the
1892
treaty.
if
you
read
article
xviii
literally,
it
says
this
treaty
shall
have
no
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
tell
me
why
it
doesn't
say
that?
i
mean,
it...
it...
it
says
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
nothing
in
this
agreement
shall
be
construed
to
abrogate
the
1858
treaty.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
everything
in
the
agreement
abrogated
one
thing
or
another
in
the
18...
the
whole
purpose
of
the
agreement
was
to
abrogate
some
elements
of
the
1858
treaty,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
other
tribal
lands?
i
mean,
that's
crucial
to
me.
i
thought
all
the
tribal
lands,
all
the
communally
owned
lands
were
given
to
the
united
states.
that's...
that's
certainly
what
this--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
all
of
the
unalloted
lands,
which
was
the
only
portion
of
the
reservation
that
was
still
held
by
the
tribe
rather
than
individual
indians.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
that
there
were...
there
were
no
tribal
lands
retained
in
1892?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
theory
which
is
beautifully
in
accord
with
the
state's
notion
that
everyone
would
have
assumed
that
if
there's
nothing
left
in
a
reservation
but
allotted
lands,
there's
no
reservation
left.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
fits
very
nicely
with
what
you
say
to
be
the...
the...
the...
the
understanding,
that...
that
you
can't
have
a...
the
reservation
went
with...
with
indian
ownership.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but--
--ms....
ms.
mcdowell,
can
i
go
back?
you
said...
you
said
rosebud
is
different
because
there
it
involved
conveyance
of
only
part
of
the
reservation,
in
so
many
words.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
case
involves
a
conveyance
of
only
part
of
the
reservation,
in
so
many
words.
namely,
the
part
that
was
held
in
fee
by
the
tribe
and
not
the
part
that
had
been
allotted.
do
you
mean
that
rosebud
involved
only
a
conveyance
of
part
of
the
tribally
owned
portion
of
the
reservation,
in
so
many
words?
is
that
what
you
mean?
