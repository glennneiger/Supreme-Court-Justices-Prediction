may
i
ask
you,
general
barnett,
you
use
the
word
"disestablishment",
but
as
i
read
particularly
judge
magill's
decision,
his
dissenting
opinion,
he's
very
careful
to
speak
always
about
diminishing.
and
you
seem
to
use
those
words
as
though
they
mean
the
same
thing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
though
judge
magill
said
that
he
thought
that
the
district
court
erred
in
holding
that
the
reservation
had
not
been
diminished?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
didn't
they
just
say
that
and
nothing
else?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
as
a
result
of
the
decision
that
we
made
in
that
case.
but
i'm
looking
at
the...
this
is
a
brief
that
was
filed
by
a
number
of
cities.
and
they
paint...
this
is
city
of
dante,
et
cetera...
they
paint,
at
pages
8
to
12,
a...
a
picture
of
massive
confusion.
and
you
are
now
standing
here
and
saying
it's
not
so;
state
law
will
still
apply
and
there
won't...
won't
be
anything
different.
i
thought
we
were
arguing
precisely
about
whether
tribal
law
of
state
law
applies,
and...
and,
hence,
whether
this
land
can
be
used
for
this
purpose
or
not.
if
it
can
under
state
law
but
can't
under
tribal
law.
and
you're
telling
us
it
doesn't
make
any
difference,
state
law
applies
anyway.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
that
a
rather
major...
just
a
whole
change
in
the
concept,
from
this
is
a
reservation
reserved
for
the
use
of
indians
to
a
concept
of
we
want
the
white
men
to
come
in
and
work
side
by
side
for...
one
is
preserving
a
culture
and
the
other
is
trying
to
break
it
up
and
assimilate
it
into
another
culture.
it
seems
to
me
that
these
two
documents
are
totally
at
odds.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but...
but
this
court
has
said
it's
nearly
irrebuttable.
that's
what
solem
said.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
then
you...
must...
mustn't
you...
mustn't
you,
if
you're
taking
that
position,
say,
"court,
you
were
wrong;
you
should
qualify
or
even
overturn
your
precedent?
"
because
the
normal
understanding
of
an
almost
irrebuttable
presumption
is
it
takes
a
whole
lot...
not
something
that
ambiguous...
ambiguous.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
say...
if
we're
faced
with
something
ir...
almost
irrebuttable
and
something
that's
kind
of
weak,
it
could
mean
one
thing,
it
could
mean
another
thing,
why
does
the...
the
part
that's
uncertain--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--dominate
what
we
have
said
is
a
very
strong
presumption?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
the
presumption
that's
created
by
the
cession
and
sum
certain
clause
is
rebutted
in
your
view?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
do
you...
do
you
agree
with
both
counsel,
it
seemed
to
me,
that
the
choice
is
either
we
accept
your
argument
based
on
article
xviii
or
there's
a
disestablishment?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
diminishment
applicable
on
these
facts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
didn't--
--may
i
ask
one--
--didn't
judge
murphy
say
she
thought
that...
that
the
disestablishment
was
the
rare
thing
and
the
diminishment
the
usual
thing?
it's
a
very--
