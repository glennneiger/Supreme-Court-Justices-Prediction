so
this
parcel
was
not
allotted
land
that
was
later
alienated?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
that
was
before
the
1890...
1892
agreement,
then?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
it
has
to
be
disestablishment
or
nothing?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
do
you
agree
with
the
theory
that
it
has
to
be...
you
would
say
nothing
and
they
would
say
disestablishment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
isn't
this--
--under
the--
--if...
if
you
would
win
the

just
continuing
with

not
then
supplant
the
state
with

justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then...
then
why
was
this
permit
denied?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
why...
why
would
the
permit
have
been
denied
if...
if...
if
you're
correct?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you
take
the
position
that
the
tribe
has
authority
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
plant
will
be
located
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about...
what
about
taxation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
does
the
state
lose
if...
if
you
lose?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
kinds
of
authority
can
you
not
exercise
if
you
lose
that
you're
exercising
now?
