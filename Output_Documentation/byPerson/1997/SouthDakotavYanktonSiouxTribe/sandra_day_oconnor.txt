justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
barnett,
was
the
particular
tract
of
land
that
we're
concerned
with
in
this
case
part
of
the
land
that
was
restored
to
the
public
domain
by
the
1892
agreement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
we
were
asking
about
this
particular
tract
of
land.
yes.
and
its
history.
this...
this
is
the
site
of
a
proposed
waste
site
or
something.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we're
talking
about
a
particular
tract
of
land.
correct.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
was
that
land
that
was
directly
restored
to
the
public
domain?
was
it
allotted
and
then
later
resold?
what
was
the
history
of
this
tract?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
respondents
rely
on
a
savings
clause
in
article
xviii,
is
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
going
to
address
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
it
is
language
that
is
different
than
that
which
we
have
seen
in
other
treaties
or
agreements.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
troubled
by
why
we
should
answer
that
broad
question.
we're
dealing
with
one
waste
site
on
some
kind
of
tract
of
land.
and
you
can't
even
tell
us
the
history
of
that
particular
tract.
so,
i
mean,
why
doesn't...
why
don't
we
just
answer
the
question
as
to
that
and
nothing
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
i'm...
i'm
still
curious,
counsel,
why
you
don't
take
the
position
that
the
1894
act
might
have
diminished
the
reservation
but
not
disestablished
it
entirely?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
take
that
position,
do
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
although
you
said
there
are
some
tribal
lands
left.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they
also
are
checkerboarded,
i
take
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
could...
could
you
enlighten
us
on
what
lands
continued
to
be
owned
by
the
tribe
as
such,
as
opposed
to
specific
indians
by
way
of
allotment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--after
1892?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
hearing
a
lot
of
"for
the
most
parts",
and
"no",
and
"there's
this
other
land",
and
"it's
scattered".
i
mean,
what
is
it?
how
are
we
to
find
out?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
we
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
they've
all
been
made...
is
there
any
land
that
was
held
continuously
by
the
tribe
as
such,
as
opposed
to
tribal
members,
since
1892?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
this...
this
is
a
totally
checkerboarded
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
was
certainly
a
factor
that
resulted
in
our
thinking
there
was
at
least
diminishment
in
the
decoteau
case.
