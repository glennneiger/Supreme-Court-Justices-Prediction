justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
how
do
you...
but
how
do
you...
what's
your
theory
of
how
the
reservation
becomes
disestablished?
that
is,
i
take
it
they
cede
200,000
acres
of
unalloted
lands.
and
you're
arguing
those
lands
are
no
longer
within
the
reservation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
not...
all
right.
they're
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
then?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
the
remaining
260,000
acres
of
allotted
land?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
is
it
that...
that
changes
the
status
of
the
allotted
land
in
your
theory?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
see,
the
part
that
i'm
having
difficulty
with
is
imagine
a
big
square,
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
four
subsquares
within
the
big
square.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
suppose
that
a
particular
treaty
said,
"we
cede
subsquares
c
and
d.
we
keep
a
and
b..
"
well,
if
that's
what
it
said,
wouldn't
you
think
the
reservation
then
consisted
of
a
and
b?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so,
if...
in
your
view,
if...
if
it's
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
and
they
say,
we
cede...
we
sell,
cede,
get
rid
of
and
absolutely
never
want
to
hear
again
of
subsquares
c
and
d,
you're
saying,
when
they
did
that,
they've
also
destroyed
the
reservation
as
to
a
and
b
automatically.
and
i...
that's...
that's
odd.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm
thinking
of
the
part
that
was
left
in
tribal
ownership.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
keep
their
tribal
status
as
to
the
little
bits
that
they
keep,
that
they
don't...
see,
what
i'm
driving
at
is
i
took...
take
it
that
felix
cohen
thought
that
they
must
have
been
left
with
at
least
some
jurisdiction
in
respect
to
little
bits
of
territory
that
they,
for
example,
kept
completely.
and
those
are
scattered
throughout
the
whole
area.
and,
therefore,
it
wouldn't
be
feasible
to
administer
little
scattered
bits,
bit
by
bit.
and,
therefore,
they
must
have
intended
to
keep
the
whole
area.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why...
why
couldn't
you,
even
if
it
was
a
checkerboard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
we
have
to
reach
that
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--do
you...
do
you
think...
what
is
the
practical
consequence
of
the...
of...
of
this
case,
one
way
or
the
other?
that
is,
i
take
it
there
are
a
lot
of
towns
in
this
area
that
are
not
indian
towns.
they're...
they're...
they're
all
the
descendants
of
the
settlers
or
whatever.
so
there
are
quite...
there
are
several
towns
in
there,
and
people
have
been
treating
it
as
part
of
south
dakota.
now,
if
you
win
this
case,
what
happens
to
those
towns?
we're
not
talking
about
giving
land
back
to
the
tribe.
we're
talking
about
jurisdiction
and
what
laws
apply,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
so
how
does
it
work?
do
the
towns
suddenly
discover
they
don't
have
judges,
that
they
don't
have...
how
does
this...
what...
what
turns
on
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
jurisdiction
in
respect
to
those
who
are
not
members
of
the
tribe
who
are
in
this
territory?
do
they
get
to
vote?
i
mean,
who
do
they
vote
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
they
have
town
councils?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
government
runs--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
in
the
nonindian
defendants,
in
the...
in
the
ones...
people,
i'm
thinking,
who
are
not
indians,
they
have
towns
and
there
are
some
laws.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
rules.
and...
and
there...
there
are
like
judges
and
mayors
and...
what
rules
apply
to
elect
all
those
people?
who...
who--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
south
dakota?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do
south
dakota
law
apply
if
it's
within
the
bounds
of
a
reservation?
is
it
that
in
reservations
normally
the
law
of
the
state
applies?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do...
is
it...
what...
i'm
just
missing
a
very
basic
hornbook
point
probably.
but
in
a
reservation,
where
there
are
groups
of
people
who
are
not
members
of
the
tribe,
what
law
applies
to
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
state
laws
apply?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
did
they
ever
get
there?
if...
if
all
of
the
unalloted
land
was
ceded
and
all
of
the
land
that
was
left
is
allotted
to
individual
members
of
the
tribe,
how
did
it
come
about
that
there
is
still
some
tribal
lands?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
tribal
lands.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
these
are
all
allotted
lands,
in
other
words?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how...
how...
what
is
the
normal
now?
i
take
it
now
differently
from
before
1906.
imagine
a
reservation
of
50
square
miles.
on
one
of
those
square
miles
live
a
group
of
people
who
are
not
indians,
who
own
their
land
in
fee,
and
who
bought
it
from
the
tribe.
now,
what
law
governs?
the
law
of
the
state
governs
those
people?
i
know
the
tribal
land
does
not
govern
them.
so
far,
it
seems
to
me
from
what
i've
looked
up,
federal
law
governs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
state
law
govern?
is
it
that
the
federal
government
has
somehow,
through
law,
statute
or
regulation,
brought
in
state
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so,
in
other
words,
these
towns
that
are
upset...
i
don't
understand
they're
upset,
or
maybe
they
shouldn't
be
upset,
because
nothing
is
going
to
change
for
them?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why
is
it...
i'm
back
at
justice
kennedy's
point...
why
is
it
that
there's
some
argument
here
about
building
a...
some
kind
of
thing
in
this...
waste
disposal
or
what
it
is...
if
the
state
law
governs
the
same
as
it
would
if
it
were
not
within
the
reservation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
statute
that
explicitly
distinguishes
between
what
happens
on
the
reservation
or
not,
everything
stays
the
same,
but
for
the
indians
themselves,
because
they
would
have
certain
rights
under
tribal
law,
et
cetera,
if
it
is
a
reservation,
throughout
the
reservation
that
they
wouldn't
have
if
it
isn't;
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indians?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
criminal
jurisdiction
over
indians.
is
there
anything
else?
is
there
anything
with
respect
to
nonindians
that
you'd
lose?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no.
forget
criminal.
i
mean,
is
there
any
civil?
