justice
david
h.
souter
help...
help
me
out,
will
you,
on...
on
the...
on
the...
the...
the
relationship
between
the
cession
language
and
the
particular
parcels
involved.
the
cession
language
clearly
referred
to
the
lands
conveyed
to
the
united
states,
which
were
then
later
conveyed
out
by
the
united
states.
did
the
cession
language
refer
to...
to
lands
which
had
already
been
allotted
but
which
were
not
at
that
point,
in
1892,
conveyed
to
the
united
states?
justice
david
h.
souter
so,
as
to
the
allotted
land,
the
cession
language
did
not
apply?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
didn't
apply.
i...
i
don't...
i
just
want
to
make
sure
that
i
understand
the
way
the
terms
were
used.
then
we
get
to
the
legal
effect
of
it.
i
take
it
that
in
terms
of...
of
the...
the
literal
statement
made,
the
language
employing
the
term
"cession"
did
not,
by
its
terms,
apply
to...
to
lands
which
had
previously
been
allotted?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
your
argument
there
is
not
that
the
jurisdiction
was
lost
by
the
cession
language
as
such,
but
by
the
application
of
some
other
rule...
and
i
think
it's
the
some
other
rule
that
i'm
not
clear
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
mmmhmm.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
will
grant
you
that.
i
don't
think
there's
any...
any
doubt
in...
at
least
in
my
mind
about
that.
but
i
take
it
that
the...
the...
the
construction
that
you
are
arguing
for
would
work
this
way
let's
take
justice
breyer's
example
and...
and
instead
of
having
the
four
quadrants,
a,
b,
c,
and
d,
let's
assume
that
there
was
1
acre
in
quadrant
d.
and
the
tribe
had
made
a...
an
agreement
with
the
united
states,
using
the
same
language
here,
ceding
the
1
acre.
i
take
it
on
your
argument
the
entire
reservation
would
be
disestablished
as
a
legal
consequence
of
that;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that,
theoretically,
would
be
the
application
of
your
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
this
would
have
been
rapid
settlement
of
1
acre.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
allotted
portions
are
to
members
of
the
tribe?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is
the
reason
that
state
law
would
apply
to
the
governance
of
the
cities
and
towns
in
justice
breyer's
example,
is
the
reason
for
that
that
there
is
no
supplanting
federal
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
see.
could...
could
i
ask
you
how
you...
how
you
respond
to
what
i
understand
to
be
the...
what
should
i
say...
the
philosophy
of...
of...
of
the
petitioner
here.
as
i
understand
it
the
claim
is
that...
that
when
all
of
the
unalloted
lands
in
a
reservation
are
ceded,
and
there
is
nothing
left
in
the
reservation
but
allotted
lands,
it
is
to
be
understood
that
the
reservation
is
thereby
closed
down.
now,
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
that,
i
suppose,
if
there
were
indeed
numerous
reservations
which
consisted
of
nothing
but
allotted
lands,
in
which
the
tribe
had
no...
no
communal
land
left
at
all.
it
had
all
been
allotted.
are
there
reservations
like
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
but
are
you
taking
the
position,
to
put
it
crudely,
sort
of
the
mirror
image
of
the
one
that...
that
i
was...
i
was
attributing
to
the
state?
i
said,
you
know,
if
they...
on
the
state's
theory,
if
they
cede
1
acre,
they
have,
in
effect,
terminated
the
jurisdiction
over
everything.
and...
and
you
are
saying,
i
guess,
that
as
long
as
they
retain
1
acre,
the
entire
reservation,
as
a
jurisdictional
entity,
as
opposed
to
a...
a
property
title--
justice
david
h.
souter
--retains.
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
thought...
then
i
don't
understand
your
answer
to
justice
scalia.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
some
of
them
have
been
in
the
tribe's
possession
since
before
the
1892
treaty?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
the...
the
land...
the...
the
communally
owned
tribal
land
was
owned
by
the
indians
and
so
held
before
1892
and
have
been
held
continuously
to
the
present
day;
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
when
the
government
purchased,
there
were
no
communally
land...
owned
lands,
tribal
lands,
retained
by
the
tribe
as
such?
that's--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
thank
you,
mr.
abourezk.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
nothing
in
there,
i
take
it,
to
suggest
that
this
kind
of
jurisdiction
was
being
exercised
over
either
allotted
lands
or
the
lands
that
were
conveyed
in
18...
or
under
the...
under
the
1892
agreement?
