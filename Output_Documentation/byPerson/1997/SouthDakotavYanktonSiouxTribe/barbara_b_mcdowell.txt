ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
to
start
with
last
things
first,
we'd
like
to
deal
with
the
jurisdiction
over
the
reservation
area
subsequent
to
1894.
one
can
find
in
the
record
annual
reports
from
the
superintendent
of
the
yankton
reservation,
from
1895,
1896
and
so
forth,
to
18...
to
1906,
which
i
believe
is
the
last
report
in
the
record...
those
reports
consistently
refer
to
the
reservation
as
a
continuing
entity.
it's
interesting
that
it
doesn't
demonstrate
any
significant
change
at
the
time
of
the
opening.
there's
a
notation
that
the
reservation
was
opened,
but
there
is
nothing
to
suggest
that
there
was
a
major
change
in
the
situation
on
the
reservation
at
the
time.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
the
record
is
unclear
as
to
whether
the
state
or
the
tribe
or
the
federal
government
was
exercising
jurisdiction
over
the
allotted
lands
at
the
time.
it
appears
that
the
only
prosecution
that
is
cited
from
the
early
era,
one
in
1895,
may
well
have
been
on
indian
allocated
lands.
it
does
not
appear
clear
from
my
reading
of
the
record.
more
significantly,
however,
the
exercise
of
criminal
jurisdiction
by
the
state
was
not
inconsistent
at
the
time
with
continued
reservation
status,
as
the
court
noted
in
the
yakima
case.
at
the
time,
it
was
thought
that
indian
character
of
the
land
went
with
indian
ownership.
and
it
was
also
thought
that
once
an
indian
received
an
allotment,
under
the
dawes
act,
the
indian
immediately
became
a
citizen
of
the
state
and
subject
to
its
plenary
jurisdiction.
that
was
only
changed
in
1906,
which
was
some
time
after
the
act
at
issue
here.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
oh,
that's
a
theory
that
this
court
has
subsequently
rejected
over
the
last
35
years.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
oh,
the
court
has
acknowledged
that
in
a
number
of
other
cases,
including
solem,
that
at
the
time,
the
understanding
was
that
indian
status
was
a
property
status,
but
that
congress
disabused
everyone
of
that
notion
in
1948,
and
that
when
we
are
deciding
these
disestablishment
and
diminishment
issues,
we
are
looking
at
reservations
as
they
have
been
considered
after
'48,
and
not
as
they
may
have
been
considered
100
years
ago.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
state
law
governs
them
except
in
some
particular
instances
that
this
court
has
spelled
out.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
no.
it's
because
the...
i
understand
it's
because
the
state
has
plenary
jurisdiction
over
its
citizens,
wherever
they
reside.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
our
position,
that
things
should
not
change--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--this
was
a...
a
particular
issue
of
the
epa's
authority
to
delegate
primary
supervision
of
landfills
to
the
state.
and
under
that
permitting
authority,
the
state
excluded
indian
reservations,
as
i
understand
it.
but
as
a
general
matter--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--as
a
general
matter,
the
state
may
tax
its
citizens
on
the
reservation.
certainly,
it
can
tax
the
nonindian
citizens
just
as
it
would,
whether
it
was
a
reservation
or
not.
it
may
also
impose
significant
taxes,
such
as
property
taxes,
on
the
indians.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
with
a
few
limited--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--exceptions,
justice
breyer.
if
an
indian
commits
a
crime...
if
a...
a
nonindian
commits
a
crime
against
an
indian,
if
it's
reservation
land,
then
federal
law
rather
than
state
law
governs
the
prosecution.
the
state,
in
a-1...
this
court,
in
a-1
contractors--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it's--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it's
my
understanding
that
those
lands
were,
for
the
most
part,
allocated
to
individual
indians.
however,
the
federal
government--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
it
appears--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--from
the
record,
which
is
not
entirely
clear,
that
there
were
some
lands
that
were
subject
to
allocation,
but
the
actual
allocations
were
not
made
until
some
time
after
1894.
there's
also
the
mile
square
area--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--it's
my
understanding
that
there
is
this
mile
square
area
that's
referred
to--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--but,
other
than
that...
although
there
are
trust
lands
today
that
are
held
by
the
tribe,
it's
not
clear
that
any
of
those
lands
were
trust
lands
earlier.
perhaps
mr.
abourezk
could
clarify
that,
however.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
and
this
court--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--well,
the
court,
in
decoteau,
found
total
disestablishment.
but
that
was
a
different
case,
in
several
respects,
from
this
one.
in
the
first
place,
of
course,
there
was
no
savings
clause
preserving
rights
under
an
earlier
treaty.
in
addition,
the
court
placed
a
lot
of
emphasis
in
decoteau
on
the
negotiation
history
with
the
tribe.
there
were
a
number
of
statements
of
tribal
leaders,
stating
that
we
understand
that
the
reservation
is
going
to
disappear,
essentially,
that
we
never
understood
that
we
would
keep
this
reservation.
here
there
are
no
statements
like
that
suggesting
any
kind
of
common
understanding
that
the
reservation
was
going
to
be
extinguished
as
a
result
of
the
act.
it's
interesting
that--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
that's
correct.
diminishment
seems
to
be
limited
to
cases
such
as
rosebud,
where
there
was
a
selling
or
a
ceding
of
a
part
of
the
reservation,
in
so
many
words,
as
opposed
to
this
sort
of
situation.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
disestablishment
is
very
rare.
this
court
has
only
found
it
in
one
prior
case,
decoteau.
and
subsequently,
in
rosebud,
the
court
suggested
that
disestablishment
should
be
more
difficult
to
find.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
yes.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
well,
the
language
of
the
statute
in
rosebud
says
"we
cede
a
part
of
our
reservation.
"
that
kind
of
language
wasn't
used
here.
the
language
was,
"we
cede
our
surplus
lands".
there
was
no
reference
to
selling
off
all
or
part
of
the
reservation.
it
should
also
be
noted
that
the
word
"cede"
didn't
have
any
single--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--settled
meaning
in
the
19th
century;
that
it
was--
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
--several
responses.
there
are
other
differences
between
this
case
and
decoteau.
ms.
barbara
b.
mcdowell
and
there
are
other
clauses
that
are
in
our
act
here
that
were
not
in
the
act
in
decoteau,
such
as
the
reservation
of
lands
for
agency
school
and
other
purposes.
that
was
not
present
in
decoteau;
it
is
present
here.
