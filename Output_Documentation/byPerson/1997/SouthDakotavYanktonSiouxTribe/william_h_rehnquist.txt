96-1581,
south
dakota
v.
yankton
sioux
tribe.
general
barnett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
barnett.
mr.
abourezk.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
about
civil
jurisdiction,
mr.
abourezk?
we
had
an
a-1
contracting
case
here
last
year,
where
the...
there
was
debate
as
to
whether
the
tribal
law
and
tribal
courts
would
rule
on
an...
on
an
automobile
accident.
now,
if...
if
the
eighth
circuit
is
upheld
here,
won't
that
same
condition
obtain
on
the
yankton
sioux
reservation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
federal
law
rather
than
state
law
would
govern?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
doesn't
go
to
tribal
lands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
go
to
whether
or
not
they
are
tribal
lands,
the
fact
that
there
may
be
indians
living
there.
i
mean,
are
there
tribal
lands?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
you
agree
that
there
are
various
inferences
that
can
be
drawn,
say,
between
article
xviii
and
article
i
and
ii,
that
it
isn't
just
crystal
clear?
and
it
seems
to
me
there,
as
justice
ginsburg
says,
if...
if
you...
unless
you're
attacking
what
we
said
was
the
test
in
solem,
that...
where
you
have
a
cession
for
a
sum
certain,
there's
an
almost
insurmountable
presumption,
you
have
to
come
up
with
something
more
than
just
one
way
of
reading
a
treaty
as
opposed
to
somebody
else's
reading,
either...
either
of
which
is
plausible.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
language
in
solem
suggests
it
meets
its
burden
of...
when
it
says
there's
a
cession
of
land
for
a
sum
certain.
which
they're
certainly
is
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
but
that
more
would
then
go
to
rebutting
the
almost
in...
insurmountable
presumption.
i...
i
just
question
whether
you
have
that
much
more.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
--but
if...
if
you
distinguish
between
individual
indian
allotments
and,
quote,
tribal
lands,
are...
are
you
saying
there
are
some
tribe...
what
you
call
tribal
lands
that
are
not
individual
allotments?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr....
who
do
we
have
here?
ms.
mcdowell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mcdowell.
general
barnett,
you
have
2
minutes
left.
general
barnett,
could
you
quickly
advise
us
what
the
jurisdictional
consequence
of
this...
of
this
case
is?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
thank
you,
general
barnett.
the
case
is
submitted.
