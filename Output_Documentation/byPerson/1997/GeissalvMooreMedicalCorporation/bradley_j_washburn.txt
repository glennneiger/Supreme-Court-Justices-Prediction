mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
believe
that
the
petitioner's
argument
in
this
case
is
very
disingenuous
in
a
couple
of
respects.
one,
of
course,
has
already
been
addressed
by
the
court's
questions,
concerning
the
blatant
attempt
at
double
recovery
of
insurance
benefits.
this
was
never
an
evil
that
cobra
was
trying
to
remedy
when
it
was
passed
to
protect
people
without
insurance--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--well,
it
concerns
us,
of
course
is,
is
that
we
don't
want
to
pay
aetna.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
right.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
well,
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
statute,
and
the
statute
as
a
whole,
and
we
have
to...
based
upon
a
holistic
look
at
the
statute,
have
to
determine
the
intent
of
congress,
and
i
don't
believe
that
congress
was
trying
to
protect
people
and
allow
them
to,
in
essence,
win
a
medical
lottery.
if
they're
entitled
to
a
double
recovery,
everybody
who
is
sick,
or
even
people
who
aren't
sick
really
would...
should
elect
cobra--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--that
is
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
we
don't
intend
to
pay
twice.
that's
certainly...
but
it
is
certainly
a
problem
with
this.
the
other
matter
that's
so
disingenuous
to
my
way
of
thinking
is,
is
complaints
about
the
status
of
the
record.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
i'm
sorry,
justice.
i
think
that
it
is
important
that
they
don't
be...
that
they're
not
entitled
to
double
recovery,
and
i'm
wanting
to
make
sure
that
they're
not
entitled
to
double
recovery,
because
we
certainly
don't
want
to
have
to
end
up
paying
twice.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
coordination--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--clauses,
justice.
the
other
issue
is,
is
the
complaints
about
the
status
of
the
record.
the
petitioner
made
the
record.
they're
the
ones
that
took
the
interlocutory
appeal.
they
were
the
ones
that
prepared
the
affidavit.
the
affidavit
was
prepared
some,
almost
2
years
after
the
date
of
the
qualifying--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--that
is
correct,
justice,
but
what...
it's
my
position--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--that's
correct,
justice.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
okay.
i'll
address
that,
justice.
the...
what
the
provision
means,
and
to
look
at
it
and
also...
i'd
like
to
point
to
the
court
on
pages
1
and
2
of
the
reply
brief
of
the
respondent,
they
sat
there
and
said
that
my
analysis
of
the
cobra
statute
as
a
whole
was
seriously
flawed,
and
therefore
my
analysis
of
what
the
plain
meaning
of
1162(d)(2)
is
was
therefore
wrong.
cobra
works
this
way,
and
if
you
look
at
section...
and
it's
at
10a
of
the
appendix
of
the
government's
brief.
cobra,
your
insurance
from
your
group
health
plan
ceases
at
the
qualifying
event,
and
some
companies
may
obviously
have
a
situation
where
they
let
you
keep
it
to
the
end
of
the
month,
or
whatever,
and
that
is
set
forth
clearly
at
1165
(1)(a).
coverage
stops
at
that
point
in
time.
what
happens
is,
is
then
there's
this
election
period
where
there's
a
period
of
time
after
the
qualifying
event
that
the
employer
has
to
give
notice,
and
then
within
60
days
after
the
notice,
the
beneficiary,
or
beneficiaries,
as
the
case
may
be,
have
to
elect
to
have
coverage,
and
then
within
45
days
later
they
have
to
pay
the
premium.
assuming
there's
notice,
assuming
there's
election,
and
assuming
there's
payment
of
premiums,
what
happens
is,
then
the
policy,
and
only
then,
does
the
policy
become
effective
as
of
the
qualifying
date.
it's
like
any
other
claims-made
insurance
policy
that
has
a
retroactive
date.
even
though
it's
paid,
purchased
on
one
date,
paid
for
on
another
date,
it
can
still
relate
back
to
a
much
farther
date,
and
that's
what
happens
here.
there
is
no
cobra
coverage
until
there
is
an
election,
and
i
believe
that
both
the
petitioner
and
the
government
seem...
the
government
to
a
lesser
extent,
they
both
seem
to
be
making
this
fallacious
understanding
of
the
statute,
and--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--i'm
sorry,
justice
ginsburg,
where--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--it
does
at
times,
yes.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
right,
and
1161,
also.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
well,
it's
new
coverage,
but
it's
coverage
that
relates
back
to
the
qualifying
event.
somebody,
just
because
they
quit
working
for
a
company,
or
are
terminated
from
their
company
on
january
1,
doesn't
have
free
right
and
free
mandatory
insurance
from
january
1
through,
say,
60
days,
through
february
28,
or--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--you
get
it
ret--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--how
it
affects
the
issue
before
us,
justice
scalia
is,
is
what
we
have
to
do
is,
is
to
interpret
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
is,
is
i
believe
we
have
to
focus
on
that
clause,
after
the
date
of
election,
set
forth
in
1162,
and
that
extremely
dangling
prepositional
clause
is
set
off,
and
it's
an
independent
prepositional
clause,
and
what
it...
the
whole
statute
is
talking
about
is,
is--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--in
the...
i'm
using
the
government's
brief.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
it's
at...
at
page
5a.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
on
the
very
first
paragraph.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
the
government's
position
is,
is
that
becomes
is
an
extremely
strong
word.
i
take
extreme
exception
with
that
position,
that
becomes
is
a
strong
word.
it's
an
extremely
passive
word,
in
fact,
and
it's
a
very
amorphous
term.
we're
not
really
sure
what
becomes
is.
if
they
use
a
strong
active
verb
like,
it
only
originates
at
that
point
in
time,
i
can
understand
that,
but
if
you
look
at
the
dictionary
definitions
set
forth
by
the
petitioner
at
paragraph
24,
and
the
government's
position
wasn't
anything
much
different
than
that,
it
defines
become
to
pass
from
one
state
to
another,
to
enter
into
some...
assuming
or
receiving
new
properties
or
qualities,
additional
matter,
or
a
new
character.
well,
it's
our
contention
that
the...
in
this
case
the
aetna
plan,
the
preexisting
spousal
insurance
plan,
took
on
an
extremely
new
character.
it
became
the
primary
insurance,
and
so
there
was
coverage.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
yes.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
well,
first
of
all
the
relevance
is,
is
that
the
petitioner--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--right.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
i
appreciate
that
position.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
my
answer
to
it
is
this...
as
the
eleventh
and
the
eighth
circuit
in
this
case
found
out
is,
is
that
the...
this
statute
talks
about
the
suspension
of
coverage,
when
coverage
may
end,
and
its...
is...
coverage
may
end
only
after
the
date
of
election.
that
is
the
first
time
that
the
employer
has
the
right
to
suspend
the
coverage.
we...
it's
axiomatic,
as
an
employer,
we
don't
have
the
right
to
suspend
something
that's
never
been
elected.
we
can't
suspend
it.
it's
simple.
i
mean,
it's
that--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--so
what
the
point
becomes
is,
is
that
the
exact
date
of
the
obtention
of
this
preexisting
policy
really
doesn't
have
a
whole
lot
to
do
with
it,
and
let
me
give
you
a
hypothetical
that
may
somewhat
clear
it
up.
let's
change
the
facts
of
this
situation
only
slightly.
mr.
geissal
was
working
for
moore
medical.
his
wife,
instead
of
being
a
long-term
employee
of
twa,
became
an
employee
of
twa
only
6
months
before
mr.
geissal
was
terminated,
and
the
twa
plan
has
a
1-year
preexisting
condition
clause.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
that's
correct.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
that
basically
gets
back
to
the
preservation
of
the
status
quo
argument.
first
of
all,
if
congress
were
so
concerned
about
the
preservation
of
the
status
quo,
their...
the
provisions
also
in
the
same
sub-sub-subsection
of
this
act,
also
(ii),
deals
with
medicare,
and
medicare
is
a
mandatory
event
that
causes
termination.
it
talks
about
eligibility
for
medicare
being
a
terminating
event,
and
medicare
has...
is
substantially
different
in
the
character
of
the
policies
between
the
normal
group
health
plan
and
this
group
health
plan.
for
one
thing
is,
is
almost
all
group
health
plans
have
prescription
medication
health.
whether
it's...
there's
a
co-pay,
or
whether
they
pay
all
of
it,
or
whatever,
there's
something
in
there.
medicare
certainly
doesn't
have
that
type
of
provision.
so
there's
two
points
is,
is
one
is
there's
no
issue
here,
and
there's
nothing
that
can
be
gleaned
from
the
face
of
the
act
that
shows
that
congress
was
concerned
about
the
preservation
of...
an
identical
preservation
of
the
status
quo,
and
there's--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--right,
without
the
free--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--no,
i
don't
believe
that
it
would.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
i
have--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--justice
breyer,
i
do
assume
that
there's
probably
a
lot
of
people
who
do
have
this
situation,
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
with
preexisting
spousal
insurance.
to
the
extent
that
it
does
cause
those
people
to
not
be
able
to
have
double
coverage,
yes,
it--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--i
don't
know
the...
i
certainly
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
this...
as
cited
by
the
petitioner,
there
is
a
law
review
article
that
said
this
was
a
midnight
passage
and
that
there
really
isn't
a
lot
of
legislative
history
on
this.
the
act
was
passed
primarily...
it
was
a
budget
act.
it
was
a
comprehensive
budget
act,
and
it
was
passed
in
response
to
staggering
budget
deficits,
and
one
of
the
concerns
was,
was
that
the
government
not
have
to
be
the
health
insurance
of
last...
health
insurer
of
last
resort,
and
to
save
the
government
money.
that
was
really
probably
what--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--that's
correct,
we
are
paid
a
premium,
but
the
practical
matter
is,
is
the
cost
of
providing
benefits
to
cobra
are
always
substantially...
or
not
always,
but
they
as
a
rule
are
substantially
greater
than
the
premiums
that
are
received,
because
people--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--well,
because
people--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--justice
scalia...
i'm
sorry.
we're
self-insured.
this
is
not
an
insurance
plan.
we're
a
self-funded
group
health
plan.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
mm-hmm.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
that
is
correct.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
well,
the
insurance
company
may
be
happy,
but
the
employer
and
the
existing
employees
may
not
be
happy,
because
of...
particularly
with
small
groups,
cobra--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--it
comes
out
of
their
pockets
and,
in
fact,
what
it
may
have
the
long-term
effect
of
doing
is,
is
causing
a
lot
of
particularly
smaller
plans
to
just
cancel
the
group
health
insurance
leaving
everybody
bare,
the
cobra
people
plus
all
of
the
employees.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
finish
my...
the
hypothetical
i
was
creating
on
the
situation
where
we
just
changed
the
facts,
where...
that
mrs.
geissal
only
went
to
work
for
twa
6
months
before
the
date
of
the
election
and
it
had
a
12-month
exclusion,
so
if
you
take
even
the
petitioner's
position
is,
he
was
terminated
and
6
months
later
he
first
became
covered
by
another
plan
without
a
preexisting
condition
clause,
because
6
months
after
the
qualifying
event
there
is
now
no
longer
a
preexisting
limitation
in
the
aetna
or
twa
plan.
so
now,
even
using
his
analogy,
he
obviously
first
becomes
covered
by
another
group
health
plan
that
does
not
contain
a
preexisting
condition,
exclusion,
or
limitation,
so
obviously,
if
you
even
take
that,
you
can
see
that
there
is
nothing
about
having
preexisting
spousal
insurance
coverage
that
caused...
that
was
bothering
congress,
that
there's
an
obvious
situation--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--it's
not
the
case--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--right.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
dictates--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--summary
judgment
was
granted
here
is,
is
because
the
trial
judge
determined
that...
he
went
along
with
what
the
eleventh
circuit
and
national
companies
and
now
the
eighth
circuit
ruled.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
right.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
maybe
i'm
not
making
myself
perfectly
clear,
justice.
i
was
trying
to
make
a
hypothetical
to
show--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--no,
they're
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
there
was...
as
i
understand
it,
mrs.
geissal
had
been
covered
for
years
by
the
twa
plan.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
right,
and
all
i'm
just
showing
is,
is
that--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--a
supercilious
approach
to
looking
at
just
the
date
of
obtention
of
the
spousal
policy
really
isn't
in
keeping
with
the
act,
and
i'm
just
showing
that
the
pure
position
of,
say,
all
pre-existing
spousal
coverage
is
exempt
from
cobra
makes
no
sense
because
of
this
hypothetical
situation.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
became
primary.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
it's
one
of
my
arguments,
yes.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
justice,
if
i
may,
i--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--get
into
that.
this
is
basically
a
coordination
of
benefit
rules.
the
national
association
of
insurance
commissioners
has
model
120,
that
talks
about
the
coordination
of
benefits
if
there's
cobra,
and
38
states,
including
missouri
and
connecticut,
which
are
the
only
two
states
that
have
any
nexus
whatsoever
to
this
case,
have
adopted
the
model
code
from
the
naic.
what
it
does--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--well,
i
don't
know
that
primary
and
secondary
coverage
should
be
thrashed
out
in
every
single
case.
there
aren't
a
lot
of
cases
out
there
holding
what
primary
and
secondary
coverage
is.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
our
policy,
our
plans...
our
plan,
erisa
plan,
sits
there
and
says
that
aetna
would
pay,
that
they're
primary,
and
that
is
also
in
accordance
with
the
naic
model
code
that
cobra--
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
--no.
while
mr.
geissal
was
working
for
us,
under
the
coordination
of
benefit
rules
we
were
his
primary
insurer.
under
our
plan,
and
also
under
the
model
rules
of
the
naic
as
adopted
by
38
states,
we
became
secondary
immediately
upon...
assuming
that
we
were...
assuming
we
gave
him
cobra,
or
this
court
were
to
order
us
to
give
him
cobra
continuation
insurance,
under
the
model
code
we
would
be
secondarily
liable
to
anything
that
just
wasn't...
an
allowable
expense
that
wasn't
paid
by
aetna.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
well,
in
my
brief
i
did
cite
that
missouri
and
connecticut
have
adopted
the
model
code,
justice.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
yes,
it
is,
and
it's
definitely
within
the
exception
for
matters
of
insurance.
it's
not
a
matter
of
federal
preemption,
something
that...
certainly
far
afield
from
what
we're
arguing
about
here.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
that
is
what
they
pled
in
the
lower...
in
the
trial
court.
i
think
it
was
paragraph
15
of
count
i.
they
said
that
moore
medical
plan
would
be
primary.
we
disputed
that.
we've
denied
it
all
along,
and
we
believe
the
law
is
substantially
in
our
favor
on
who
would
be
primary
and
who
would
be
secondary,
assuming
that
there
even
were
cobra.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
okay.
i
could
talk...
i
don't
have
a
whole
lot
of
time
to
talk
on
that,
and
i
could
talk
for
a
long
time
on
that,
but
assuming
it's
the
individual,
the
ill
person
who
has
the
right
to
make
that
election,
essentially
that
just
reads
away
the
sub-subsection
that
we've
been
talking
about.
it
makes
it
a
nullity.
it
takes
away
the
employer's
expansive
rights
and
liberal
rights
to
terminate
cobra
coverage.
it's
now
totally
in
the
hands
of
the
ill
person,
and
it's
not...
they
can
make
the
election,
and
it's
not
that
situation.
the
gap
has
to
do
with
whether
there's
a
gap
between
the
policies.
obviously,
you
know,
there's
always
going
to
be
a
gap
when
you
have
to
drop
one
policy.
mr.
bradley
j.
washburn
well,
under
the
status
of
the
law
basically
in
the
eighth
circuit
if
there
is
a
substantial...
if
there
were
a
substantial
gap,
then
cobra
continuation
insurance
coverage
would
have
to
be
offered,
and
obviously
the...
two
courts
have
now
held
in
this
case
that
there
was
no
significant
gap,
and
there
is
no
significant
gap
in
this
case.
if
there
are
no
more
questions--
