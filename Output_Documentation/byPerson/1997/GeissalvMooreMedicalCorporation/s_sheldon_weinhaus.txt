mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
mr.
geissal,
who
is
now
dead,
was
terminated
from
his
employment
by
moore
medical
corporation
at
a
time
when
he
had
cancer
and
was
dying
of
cancer.
he
was
offered
immediately
cobra
continuation
and
at
the
same
time
his
wife
had
always
carried
health
insurance
coverage
with
her
own
employer
which
covered
dependents,
including
mr.
geissal.
he
was
allowed
to
continue
to
make
cobra
payments
for
6
months,
when
all
of
a
sudden
moore
medical
announced
that
it
was
not
responsible
for
his
health
insurance
coverage,
they
wrongly
accepted
cobra
payments,
they
would
pay
him
back,
and
they
would
not
pay
any
of
his
bills.
this
case
was
brought,
using
the
wording
of
the
statute,
and
the
wording
is
simple,
and
that's
where
we
start
with,
that
coverage
must
be
offered
to
the
individual
of
the
same
quality
as
given
to
employees,
and
that
would
be
true...
if
employees
got
dual
coverage,
he
would
be
entitled
to
dual
coverage,
required
to
offer
the
same
policy,
and
it
must
extend
for
at
least
the
period
beginning
on
the
date
of
the
qualifying
event
and
ending
not
earlier
than
the
earliest
of
the
following,
and
one
of
them
is,
when...
the
date
on
which
he
becomes...
first
becomes
qualified
after
the
date
of
election
for
further
insurance.
now,
in
this
instance,
moore
medical
corporation
took
the
position
that
he
first
became,
after
the
date
of
election,
covered
by
the
wife's
policy
and
therefore
was
not
entitled
to
the
coverage.
at
that
point,
litigation
ensued.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
we
know
some
of
them
were
paid.
we
do
not
know
whether
all
of
them
were
paid.
my
understanding,
some
were
not
paid,
but
unfortunately
in
this
case
what
the
magistrate
judge
did
is,
after
denying
our
motion
for
summary
judgment,
turned
around
and,
sua
sponte,
without
development
of
anything
in
the
record,
declared
summary
judgment
for
moore
medical
corporation,
so
there
is
no
record
and,
while
moore
medical
does
continuously
argue,
in
the
absence
of
a
record,
that
we
lost
nothing,
we
don't
think
that's
true.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
well--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--well,
the
claimed
injury
are,
amongst
other
things,
we
have
at
least
the
deductible
that
we
have
to
pay
for,
and
we
have
to
face
health
care
providers
who
may
hereafter
bill
us.
in
these
cases,
in
the
health
insurance
field,
the
health
providers
do
not
send
the
bill
to
the
patient,
usually,
they
send
them
to
the
health
institution
which
is
paying
the
bills.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
well,
it
now
occurred
a
couple
of
years
ago,
but--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--we
have
not
been
told
of
any
bills.
the
only
bills
i
know
of
in
which
there's
likely
injury
is
what
i
call
the
greek
trip
in
which
he
received
medication
in
the
greek
islands,
for
which--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--well,
what
also
remains
of
the
claim
is
this.
there
may
be,
in
fact,
double
coverage.
i
don't
know
here.
we
have
not
gotten
that
far.
moore
says
there's
no
double
coverage,
and
at
the
same
time
it
says
there
is
double
coverage.
we
are
entitled,
under
erisa--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--well,
there's
certainly
a
difference
in
the
cap
on
total...
well,
there's
no
difference...
there
is
and
there
isn't.
each
one
has
a
million
dollars
coverage,
so
that
in
essence,
had
he
survived,
or
had
he
lived,
or
had
he
been
willing
to
assume
financial
responsibility
for
more
than
a
million
dollars
of
debt,
he
could
have
proceeded.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
he
did
not
live.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
yes,
but
the--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--well,
we
don't...
we
have
not...
we
did
not
get
that
far
in
discovery
because
of
the
way
that
the
magistrate
handled
that,
but
presuming
that
they
are--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--there's
a
realistic
possibility,
for
the
greek
trip,
that
there
are.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
yes,
but...
and
we
know
that
aetna
did
not
pay
that.
now,
whether
moore--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--ordinarily,
the
rule
is,
his
employer
and,
as
pleaded
in
the
case,
and
as
uncontested
in
the
case,
moore
was
the
primary
carrier.
moore
would
pay
first
and,
in
fact,
even
in
this
case,
as...
notwithstanding
their
argument,
if
moore
was
required
to
pay
us
the
benefit,
which
is
all
erisa
allows
us
in
any
event,
if
moore
is
required
to
pay
the
benefit
they
have
promised
to
us,
and
if
aetna's
entitled
to
get
from
us,
then,
what
moore
has
paid
us
in
reimbursement,
in
subrogation,
aetna
would
have
to
pay
us
our
additional
deductible.
aetna
would
have
to
pay
us
whatever
our
premiums
cost
to
make
sure
that
we
would
not
have
that.
we
do
have
a
claim.
even
if
it's
a
small
claim,
it
still
exists,
and
aetna
would
be...
would
have
to
submit
to
that.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
yes.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
there
is
nothing
that
provides
cobra
coverage
will
be
secondary.
in
fact,
cobra
says
it
must
be
of
the
same
quality
as
offered
to
regular
employees,
and
the
same
quality
offered
to
regular
employees
is
that
moore
will
be
primary.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
that's
a
fair
statement.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
it
has
not
been
developed
because
of
the
decision
of
the
magistrate
to
grant
summary
judgment
sua
sponte.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
we
certainly
claim
we
have
a
claim,
and
we
know
it's
at
least
of
the
deductible
amount,
plus
whatever
premiums
they
say
we
would
have
had
to
pay.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
that
was
his
major
concern.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
yes,
it
does.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
well,
not
only
that,
but
i
don't
think...
i
think
we're
entitled
to
the
entire
benefit.
if
it
comes
out
to
$120,000--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--and
in
addition
to
that,
though,
your...
that's
correct,
but
in
addition
to
that,
she
has
the
right
to
say,
i
want
the
whole
benefit,
$120,000.
it's
true,
aetna
may
say
to
me,
give
us
back
80,
give
us
back
110,
or
give
us
back
everything,
except
we're
going
to
pay
you
what
you
had
to
pay
in
addition.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
no.
this
is
health
insurance
benefits.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
well,
it's
my
understanding...
again,
these
are
from
off-the-record
statements
of
counsel,
is
that
they
paid...
that
aetna
paid
$120,000.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
to
health
care
providers,
to
hospitals,
to
doctors.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
what
erisa
says
is
that
you're
not
entitled
to
any
damages.
you
are
only
entitled
to...
besides
fees,
and
there
are
penalties
too
here,
that
you
are
entitled
to
the
benefit,
and
if
we're
entitled
to
120
from
moore,
we're
entitled
to
120
from
moore.
now,
aetna
may
be
in
a
position,
again,
depending
upon
what
the
law
is,
to
say,
uh-uh,
we
paid
120.
now
you
owe
that
to
us,
less
your
costs
and
expenses.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
that
doesn't
defeat
our
$120,000
claim
in
any
way,
and
every
other
employee
of
moore
would
have
the
same
right
to
make
that
same
claim
if
moore
did
not
pay
the
bills
and
some
secondary
carrier
that
they
also
had
paid
the
bill.
we're
the
same
as
them,
and
that's
real--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--well,
there
are
also
penalties,
because--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--oh,
yes,
those
are
penalties
that
go
into
the
pocket
of...
because
our
theory
is,
on
that,
is
that
if
you
do
not
give
a
proper
notice
under
the
statute
you're...
this
employer
is
subject
to
a
penalty
of
up
to
$100
a
day
for
not
giving
a
proper
notice,
and
while--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--because
this
claim
has
not
been
adjudicated,
but
on
the
adjudication
of
the
claim,
if
we
are
correct
that
they
should
have
continued
the
policy,
at
that
point
in
time
we
are
entitled
to
a
penalty
of
up
to
$100
a
day
being
assessed,
and
that
goes
to
the
plaintiff,
and
at
the
time
they
announced
this,
mr.
geissal
was
very
much
alive
and
very
much
concerned
about
having
the
wherewithal
to
survive,
if
he
could.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
well,
the
merits
of
it
are,
of
course,
in
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
itself,
your
honor,
because
he
was
covered
already
under
the
wife's
policy,
the
twa
health
insurance
plan
at
the
time.
now,
we
are
told
by
the
eighth
circuit
that
that
plan
did
not
become
effective
until
after
his
election.
now,
that
is
not
correct
at
all,
because
under
erisa
a
plan
becomes
effective
when
you're
covered.
under
erisa,
as
he
would
be
a
beneficiary
in
the
wife's
plan,
he
would
be
entitled
to
sue
immediately
for
any
plan
violation.
he
would
have
a
right
under
erisa,
section
502(a)(1),
to
sue
to
clarify
his
rights
to
future
benefits.
he
would
have
a
right
immediately
to
ask
for
a
copy
of
the
summary
plan
description
and
ask
for
plan
information.
that
right
does
not
start
with
his
termination
by
moore,
or,
worse
yet,
with
the
date
of
his
election.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
yes.
the
exact
statutory
language
is...
appears
on
page
23
of
our
brief.
it's...
basically
says
the
coverage
must
extend
for
at
least
the
period
beginning
on
the
date
of
the
qualifying
event...
now,
that
is
the
date
of
termination...
and
ending
not
earlier
than
the
earliest
of
the
following,
the
date
on
which
the
qualified
beneficiary
first
becomes
after
the
date
of
election.
now,
he...
therefore,
under
this
statute
he
is
immediately
covered...
as
long
as
he
chooses
to
elect,
he
is
immediately
covered
from
the
date
of
his
termination.
under
cobra,
the
employer
must
give
you
a
notice
of
election,
right
to
elect,
within
45
days
of
the
qualifying
event.
the
employer
must
give
the
individual
60
days
to
make
the
election,
and
then
the
individual
has
yet
another
90
days
to
pay
the
premium.
and,
incidentally,
cobra's
not
a
free
gift.
under
the
statute
it's
102
percent
of
the
employer's
cost
and
as
a
result,
upon
his
death
he
immediately
becomes
covered
if
he
ultimately
elects,
and
none
of
these
cases
go
into
the
fact
that
in
fact
this
coverage
continues
until
at
least
the
date
of
the
election,
because
it
says,
it
does
not
end...
end
is
congress'
words...
not
earlier
than
the
date
of
the
following,
the
date
he
first
becomes,
after
the
date
of
election,
covered.
so
their...
under
their--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--he
never
became
covered,
first
became
covered
after
the
date
of--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--he
was
already
covered.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
he
was
already...
there
was
nothing
new.
first
becomes
means
there
must
be
some
change
in
status,
some
change
in
position,
and
that
did
not
occur
here.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal
if
i
may,
your
honor.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
i
only
have
one
answer,
justice
ginsburg,
to
your
question
as
to
what
law
prevails
here
in
terms
of
how
that...
how
the
coverage
should
be
read,
and
that's
a
decision
of
this
court
some
years
ago,
fmc
v.
halliday
corporation,
in
which
you
held
self-insured
funds
are
not
subject
to
state
insurance
regulations
at
all.
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
i
do
know...
of
course,
i
can't
speak
to
what
congress
intended
as
to
medicare,
but
i
do
know
in
the
early
history,
when
cobra
was
being
discussed,
that
in
fact
congress
really
carved
out...
they
said
first
becomes
for
other
insurance,
and
they
left
out
the
first
becomes
for
medicare,
so
i
tend
to
believe
that
congress
always
believed
there
was
some
slight
difference
between
the
two
and
the
way
it
was
going
to
treat
it,
but
i
can't--
mr.
s.
sheldon
weinhaus
--if
there
are
no
other
questions,
justice,
we
would
rest.
