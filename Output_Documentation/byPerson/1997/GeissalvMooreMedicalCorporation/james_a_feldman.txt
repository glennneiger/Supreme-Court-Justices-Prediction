mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
general
idea
is
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
and
especially
in
a
case
like
this
it
would
affect
the--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
wouldn't
say
it's
a
glitch.
i
would
say
that
that
was
a
consequence,
a
necessary
consequence,
and
one
that
congress
would
have
wanted,
of
their
decision
to
hinge
everything
from
the
date
of
election
and
not
from
the
date
of
the
termination.
the
date
of
termination
only
sets
the
notice
requirements
going
in.
it's
the
date
of
election
that
determines...
that
you're
supposed
to
look
at
to
determine
when
coverage...
when
you
can
terminate
coverage.
having
done
that,
they
can't...
there's
no
way
to
be
sure
that
somebody
in
the
position
of
the
decedent
here
at
the
date
that...
let's
say...
let's
take
someone
who
loses
their
job
on
day
1.
on
day
2,
they
go
get
another
job.
the
employer
says,
do
you
want
health
insurance,
i
don't
have
much
of
a
policy
but
we
have
something
to
offer
you,
and
the
employee
says,
sure.
on...
30
days
later
the
employee
gets
a
notice
that
you're
entitled
to
cobra
coverage,
and
you
have
60
days
to
elect,
blah,
blah,
blah.
well,
in
that
case,
under
respondent's
view,
because
the
employee
has
already
accepted
coverage
under
the
new
job,
before
he
knew
the
consequences
of
doing
that,
he
can't
get
cobra
coverage
or
at
least
it
would
have
to
terminate
right
at
the
day
of
election.
now,
i
think
that
that's
a
consequence
that
congress
didn't
want.
in
other
words,
the
only
way
congress--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--let
me...
that
is
a
view...
the
significant
gap
explanation
is
one
that's
been
adopted
by
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
agreed
with
respondent
in
the
courts
below.
and
they've
done
that
because
they
realize
that
congress
generally
didn't
intend
the
harsh
consequences
of
someone
who
was,
let's
say
relying
on
their
own
insurance
and
let's
say
a
family
may
have
been
relying
very
heavily
on
the
employee's
insurance
and
had
a
supplemental
policy
also
that
the
spouse
had,
and
those
courts
have
felt,
well,
congress
couldn't
have
intended
that
they
lose
their
primary
health
coverage
just
because...
when
they
terminate
their
job
just
because
they
have
some
very
inadequate
coverage
under
the
spouse's
policy,
so
they
look
at
whether
there's
a
significant
gap.
under
our
view,
that
significant
gap
inquiry,
which
isn't
triggered
by
any
text
in
the
statute--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that
would
only
be
the
case
if
you
adopt...
if
it
were
true
that
there
is
a
significant
gap
inquiry
that's
required
under
the
statute.
under
our
view,
that
doesn't
fit
into
the
statutory
language,
and
the
way--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
the
way
that
the
problem
is
resolved--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right.
the
way
that
the
problem
is
resolved
is
by
giving
the
employee
the
opportunity
to
elect.
if
the
employee
believes
that
the
other
policy
is
inadequate,
the
employee
will
probably
elect
cobra
coverage
and
the
employee
is
entitled
to
get
it.
if
the
employee
believes
that
the
other
coverage
is
fully
adequate,
then
the
employee
certainly
will
not
elect
cobra
coverage
because
it's
expensive.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
and
he's
also
in...
i
might
add
that
if
you
look
at
the
significant
gap
inquiry,
it's
very
hard
to
work,
because
the
plan
administrator
has
to
make
the
determination
sometime
after
the
date
of
election
of
comparing
the
provisions
of
the
two
policies.
the
plan
administrator
has
to
know
the
provisions
of
the
other
policy,
which
the
plan
administrator
may
well
not
have,
has
to
know
the
medical
condition
of
the
decedent
to
determine
whether,
in
light
of
that...
not
of
the
decedent,
of
the
employee
in
most
cases,
to
determine
whether,
in
light
of
that,
the
gap
is
significant.
that's
an
inquiry
that's
very
difficult
to
make.
under
our
view,
congress
left...
the
statute
works
quite
well
where
those
decisions
are
left
up
to
the
employee.
in
our
view
also
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
sufficient
to
resolve
the
case.
the
statute
says
that
the
employer
may
terminate
coverage
on
the
date
on
which
the
qualified
beneficiary
first
becomes,
after
the
date
of
election,
covered
under
any
other
plan.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
argument
would
be
the
same,
but
i
do
think
that
becomes
is
the
word
that
really
makes
it
unambiguous.
or,
put
it
the
other
way,
i
think
becomes
is
probably
stronger
than
first,
but
i
think
when
operating
together
they
plainly
convey
the
meaning
that
congress
intended
here.
if
you...
if
a
plan
administrator
asks,
on
the
date
after
the
date
of
election
says,
has
this
employee
today
first
become
covered
under
any
other
plan,
i
think
the
only
possible
answer
is
no.
he
hasn't
first
become
covered
because
he
was
covered
all
along.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
i...
generally,
yes.
i
mean,
there
are
cases--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
but
the...
that's
correct.
it's
the
becomes
is...
carries
the
major
part
of
the
weight,
and
i
do
think
first
adds
to
it.
but
in
any
event,
because
on
the
date
after
the
date
of
election
it
cannot
be
said
that
the
employee
has
first
become
covered
under
the
other
plan,
and
that
won't
be
true
at
any
other
future
date
if
there's
continuous
coverage,
the
employer
cannot
terminate
cobra
coverage
on...
just
right
after
the
date
of
election
on
the
basis
that
the
employee
has
first
become
covered
by
a
plan
that
he
had,
in
fact,
all
along.
in
our
view,
that
fits
well
within
the
purposes
of
the
statute
because,
as
i
said,
it
provides...
it
enables
employees
who
are
relying
on
that
coverage
and
who
may
have
had
wholly
inadequate
second
coverage
to
make
the
decision
of
what
kind
of
coverage
is
adequate
for
them,
and
to
have
that
for
this
temporary
period
of
time
for
up
to
18
months
in
a
case
like
this,
while
they
make
whatever
other
plans
they
wanted.
in
response...
i
just
want
to
add,
because
i
do
think
that
the
hardest
case
for
us
is
the
case
where
the
employee...
the
case
that
justice
scalia
raised,
which
is
where
the
employee
gets
the
coverage
during
the
election
period,
that
really
it's
necessary
to
allow
that
to
happen,
because
that
is
the
only...
the
only
way
that
congress
could
ensure
itself
that
an
employee,
when
it
made
an
election
with
respect
to
the
new
policy,
when
it
decided
it
wanted
the
coverage...
when
he
decided
he
wanted
coverage
under
the
new
policy,
it
was
the
only
way
that
congress
could
be
sure
that
that
was
an
informed
choice.
and
it's
also
clear
from
the
general
structure
of
the
statute
that
congress
wanted
those...
the
employee
to
have
that
choice.
for
example,
when
a...
let's
take
on
the
65th
day,
or
the
70th
day,
long
after
the
date
of
election,
and
an
employee
who
is
covered
under
cobra
gets
a
new
job,
well,
at
that
point,
when
the
new
employer
says,
do
you
want
health
insurance
under
this
job,
or
health
coverage,
the
employee
is
not...
just
because
he's
offered
the
health
insurance,
cobra
coverage
doesn't
terminate.
the
statute
says
it's
when
he
becomes
covered
under
the
new
plan,
not
when
he
becomes
eligible
under
the
new
plan,
and
that
shows
that
congress
wanted
people
to
have
the
opportunity
to
make
the
choice
as
to
whether
they
wanted
the
cobra
coverage
or
whether
they
wanted
the
new
coverage.
if
you
adopt
the
view
of
respondent
and
the
court
of
appeals,
the
employees
wouldn't
have
that
choice
very
frequently.
i
think
our
view
is
also
supported
by
related
provisions
of
cobra
which
provide,
for
example,
that
the
coverage
that's
provided
under
cobra
has
to
be
identical
to
the
coverage
that
the
employee
had
while
working
for
the
former
employer,
and
it's
consistent
with
that
purpose
to
permit
employees
who
had
dual
coverage,
who
felt
it
was
necessary
because
of
extraordinary
medical
needs,
because
of
the
inadequacy
of
a
spouse's
plan,
or
perhaps
just
because
of
their
own
very
strong
desire
to
have
security
with
respect
to
their
medical
costs,
to
permit
employees
who
are
in
that
situation
who
had
dual
coverage
before
for
sometime,
to
be
able
to
also
continue
the
dual
coverage
during
the
temporary
cobra
period
so
long
as
they're
willing
to
pay
for
it.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
it
would
be
18
months
unless
some
other
qualifying
event
occurs...
unless
some
other
terminating
event
occurs,
of
which
there
are
several
others,
in
addition
to
the
one
that's
at
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't
understand
why
they
said
that,
because
in
looking
at
it
myself
i
didn't
see
why
it
was
a
close
question,
so
in
my
view
it
was
a
valid
54(b)
certification
and
therefore
it
was
validly
before
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
perhaps
it
did,
but
i
didn't...
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
issues
that
were
before
the
court,
which
were
i
and
ii,
i
was
the
basic
cobra
coverage
count,
and
ii...
wait
a
minute,
i'm
forgetting
here
exactly
what
ii
was.
in
any
event,
i
thought
that
those
counts
were
plainly
separate
counts
that
could
be
resolved
on
a
strictly
legal
basis
that
this
was,
and
that
they
were
therefore
suitable
for
a
resolution
under...
for
partial
summary
judgment
under
section
50...
rule
54(b).
if
there's
no
other
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
argument.
