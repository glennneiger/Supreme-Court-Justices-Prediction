unknown
speaker
mr.
weinhaus,
would
you
explain
to
me
what
your
client
stands
to
recover
now?
were
mr.
geissal's
medical
expenses
actually
paid
by
the
other
policy?
unknown
speaker
well,
presumably
your
client
ought
to
know
whether
something
was
lost
or
not.
is
there
no
claim?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
claimed
injury
now?
unknown
speaker
how
long
ago
did
this
death
occur?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
have
any
bills
and
we
don't
know
if
there's
any
injury.
unknown
speaker
it's
just
hard
to
picture
what
remains
of
the
claim,
if
anything.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
argument
was
you
would
not
be
entitled
to
double
coverage
and
one
aspect
of
this
that
i
hope
you
will
clarify,
you're
talking
about
maybe
bills
coming
in
later,
but
there
are
insurance
policies.
you
have
both
insurance
policies
and
were
told
that
the
only
difference
is
in
the
deductible,
and
is
there
another
difference?
what
about
the
cap
on
total
benefits?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
very
interesting,
but
he
didn't
live.
unknown
speaker
he's
dead
now,
and
that's
all
irrelevant,
isn't
it,
unless,
indeed,
the
bills
presented
are
over
a
million
dollars,
or
over
whatever
the
limit
was.
unknown
speaker
and
are
they?
unknown
speaker
is
there
a
realistic
possibility
that
they
are?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't...
if
he
took
a
trip
to
the
greek
islands,
wouldn't
he
know
how
much
that
cost?
unknown
speaker
there's
another
question
i
had
about
how
this
works
is,
let's
assume
he's
still...
he's
just
sick,
he's
not
dead,
and
he's
still
working,
and
he's
got
this
dual
coverage.
who
pays
first
in
these
dual
coverage
situations,
his
employer
or
the
other,
or
is
it...
how
is
that
worked
out?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
your
claim,
as
i
understand
it,
is,
at
a
minimum,
the
claim
for
the
greek
island
trip,
which
aetna
has
not
yet
paid.
unknown
speaker
and
number
2,
i
think
your
answer
is,
assuming,
though
it
didn't
get
raised
explicitly
by
anybody,
that
there's
nothing
in
the
cobra
act
which
provides
that...
your
answer
may
be
assuming
that
there's
nothing
in
the
cobra
act
that
provides
that
cobra
coverage
will
be
secondary
coverage,
necessarily.
unknown
speaker
okay.
then
i
take
it
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
situation
we're
in
on
standing
is
this.
it
may
ultimately
turn
out
that
you
have
no
recoverable
claim,
but
at
this
point
that
is
an
evidentiary
matter
and
nobody
can
determine
that
at
this
point.
is
that
a
fair
statement?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weinhaus--
--well,
but
you
claim
you
have
a
claim.
unknown
speaker
may
i
be
blunt
about
one
aspect
of
this.
going
in,
he's
still
alive,
and
he's
suing,
and
he
could
linger
for
a
long
time,
and
maybe
he
could
exceed
even
the
maximum
under
the
policy.
unknown
speaker
but
he's
now
dead,
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out.
the
statute
provides
for
attorney's
fees,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
is
that
an
element
that
stays
on,
that...
you
have
the
argument
that
the
deductible,
you'd
have
to...
you're
out
of
pocket
the
extra
$350,
but
then
you'd
have
to
pay
back
the
premiums
to
moore,
which
amount
to
in
excess
of
$2,500,
so
you
net...
you'd
be
a
net
loser,
unless
what
you're
saying
is,
if
we
prevail,
then
we
get
our
attorney's
fees
from
the
beginning
of
this
representation.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
it
was
nothing
else,
could
you
say,
yeah,
we
still
have
a
claim.
it's
her
claim.
it's
her
claim
to
get
her
counsel
fees
paid.
unknown
speaker
this
was
a
death
benefit?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
you
be
paid
$120,000
in
a
lump
sum?
unknown
speaker
to
whom?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
you
have
a
right
to
obtain
that?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that
doesn't
defeat
your
claim
against
moore.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
the
issue
on
that
would
be
whether
there's
standing
when
somebody
brings
a
claim
which
is
confronted
with
a
counterclaim
of
a
greater
amount
than
the
claim,
is
there
still
standing
to
be
the
claim.
i
suppose
there
is.
you
mentioned
penalties,
and
are--
unknown
speaker
--are
those
penalties
that
go
into
the
pocket
of
the
plaintiff?
unknown
speaker
but
i
thought
that
was
a
claim
that
hasn't
yet
been
adjudicated.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
get
to
the
merits,
do
you
think?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
focus
on
the
exact
statutory
language
that
you're
relying
on,
mr.
weinhaus.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
he
never
first
became
covered
after
the
date
of
election
here.
unknown
speaker
or
he
never--
unknown
speaker
--he
never
became
covered.
he
was
covered,
period.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
weinhaus.
mr.
feldman.
mr.
feldman,
the
government
asserts
as
the
rationality
of
the
position
that
you're
supporting
here
that
it
retains
the
status
quo,
but
it
really
doesn't
always
retain
the
status
quo,
because
it
could
be
that
the
additional
coverage
was
acquired
after
the
termination
event,
but
during
the
period
before
the
election,
and
then
the
first
becomes
would
still
not
apply,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
really
preserving
the
status
quo
that
existed
at
the
time
of
the
person's
employment.
unknown
speaker
and
you
explain
this
as
a
glitch.
they
just
didn't
do
it
quite
right.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
feldman,
don't
they
have
the
gap
exception
to
take
care
of
that?
unknown
speaker
you
posed
the
case
where
there
was
significantly
less
insurance
under
the
new
policy.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
saying
that
it's
ameliorated.
it's
not
quite
as
stark
as
you
say,
because
they
do
concede
that
if
there's
a
significant
gap
then
you
retain
the--
unknown
speaker
--because
it
continues
anyway.
because
it
continues
anyway--
unknown
speaker
--if
it
was
not
first...
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
is,
he
is
in
a
position
to
assess
whether
there's
a
gap
or
not.
unknown
speaker
would
your
argument
be
the
same...
it
wouldn't
be
as
good,
but
would
you
take
the
same
position
if
it
said,
first
is
covered?
unknown
speaker
first
is
really
a
redundant
or
emphatic
word.
you
can't
second
become.
you
either
become
or
you
don't
become,
right?
unknown
speaker
you
either
become
or
you
already
were,
one
or
the
other.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
the
temporary
period
in
this
case
would
be
18
months?
unknown
speaker
mr.
feldman,
because
it
is
jurisdictional,
can
you
explain
why
the
eighth
circuit
thought
the
54(b)
issue...
they
said
it
was...
they
considered
it
a
close
question,
and
then
didn't
expand
on
it,
whether
there
was
an
immediately
appealable
judgment,
final
judgment--
unknown
speaker
--i
note
that
count
iv
is
discrete.
that
was
for
the
information
reporting.
but
court
iii,
maybe
that
had
something
to
do
with
why
this
wasn't
finished.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
washburn.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
that
relevant?
i
mean,
if
he
gets
$120,000
from
you,
and
if
aetna
wants
their
money
back,
they'll
get
their
money
back.
what's
the
problem?
i
mean,
what's
the
problem
insofar
as
it
concerns
us
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
i
know
it
concerns
you,
but
our
basic
problem
is
to
decide
this
particular
case.
unknown
speaker
and
how
is
it
relevant
to
our
problem?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
quite
see
that,
because
i
thought
most
insurance
policies
have
in
them
clauses
so
that
you
can't
get
a
double
recovery,
and
one
way
is,
they
may
have
to
pay
the
money
back.
another
way
is,
insurance
company
2
sues
insurance
company
1.
i
thought
the
insurance
industry
is
filled
with
devices
in
contracts
that
prevent
that.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
is
that
really
a
prob...
a--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
mean,
if
you
start
out
saying,
this
is
disingenuous,
they
don't
want
double
recovery,
and
then
you
tell
us
there's
not
going
to
be
double
recovery,
it
seems
to
me
that
your
opening
salvo
is
rather
ineffective.
unknown
speaker
but
what
do
they
call
the
insurance
clauses
that
prevent...
accommodation
clauses,
is--
unknown
speaker
--coordination--
unknown
speaker
--well,
they
took
an
interlocutory
appeal
because
they
were
thrown
out
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
meaning
of
this
statute,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
nothing
to
do...
if
the
statute
means
what
you
say
it
means,
then
i
don't
see
how
any
of
the
rest
of
this
is
relevant,
because
you're
not
entitled
to
more
than
one
policy,
as
you
read
it.
unknown
speaker
you
say
this
statute
just
protects
the
person
against
the
loss
of
any
insurance,
and
that...
so
you
present
a
stark
question
of
statutory
interpretation
on
which
you
divide...
you
prevailed
on
your
reading,
and
the
rest
of
it
seems
to
me,
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
not
relevant
to
the
question
before
us,
which
is
what
does
this
provision
mean.
unknown
speaker
why
did
congress
use
the
word,
continuation
coverage?
it
didn't
say,
renewal,
or...
it
says
continuation.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
the
statute
uses
the
words,
continuation
coverage.
unknown
speaker
--section
1162.
unknown
speaker
that...
at
least
that
caption
seems
to
run
counter
to
what
you're
describing,
which
is
a
termination
and
then
a
revival.
unknown
speaker
you
get
it
retroactively
when
you
pay
the
premium.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
that
affects
the
issue
that's
before
us
here.
unknown
speaker
where
do
we
find
this
independent
clause
in
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
whereabouts
on
the
page?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
will
you
deal
with,
before
you
get
to
the
after,
first
become?
unknown
speaker
this
first
becomes
coverage--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
i'd
like
to
get
your
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question.
i
mean,
you
had
a
point,
which
was
quite
right,
that
if
on...
he's
fired
on,
say,
january
1,
or
leaves
the
job.
he
gets
his
notice,
let's
say
on
february
1.
he
has
until
april
1
to
elect.
now,
if
he
elects
on,
let's
say,
march
15,
he's
covered
back
to
january
1.
what's
the
relevance
of
that
point?
that
was
what
i
think
justice
scalia
asked,
and--
unknown
speaker
--throughout
this
whole
period,
of
course,
he's
covered
by
the
aetna
policy.
unknown
speaker
so...
it
has
to
do
with
what
happened
to
the
aetna
policy.
he
didn't
first
become
covered
by
the
aetna
policy
after
the
election
period.
he
was
covered
by
the
election
policy
forever.
i
mean,
long
before...
by
the
aetna
policy.
unknown
speaker
but
what's
your
answer?
i
mean,
that...
go
back
to
justice
scalia's
question.
what
is
the...
what
is
the
point?
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--your
point
basically
is,
don't
pay
that
much
attention
to
the
words
become
after
the
date
of
election
and
first,
for
the
reason
that,
until
the
election,
there
was
nothing
in
effect,
so
it's
natural
for
congress
to
have
used
those
words,
since
the
election
created
a
nothing
into
a
something.
unknown
speaker
it
really
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
issue
before
us.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
argument.
okay,
good.
if
i
understand
that,
then,
let's
go
to
the
question
of
why
congress
might
have
wanted
it,
and
i
take
it
that
the
reason
they
might
have
wanted
this
interpretation
that
the
petitioners
have
is
because
they
figure
all
of
us...
you
know,
many
people
in
this
room,
hundreds
of
people
have
coverage
through
their
employer,
their
spouse
works,
he
or
she
has
coverage
as
well,
so
everybody
has
two
policies,
basically,
the
potential
for
two.
not
everybody
in
the
world,
but
huge
numbers.
and
what
congress
is
interested
in,
after
all,
is
that
when
you
lose...
when
one
spouse
loses
one
job,
they
want
a
conscious
choice,
or
otherwise
you're
covered
for
18
months.
so
during
the
18
months
period,
if
you
don't
make
a
conscious
choice
to
go
choose
something
else,
you're
still
covered
by
your
employer.
if
you
make
a
conscious
choice,
the
employer
should
be
off
the
hook.
now,
i
mean,
that's
an
obvious
reading,
i
guess,
of
the
purpose.
that
seems
to
be
what
i
got
out
of
the
other
side's
briefs.
what's
your
response?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
your
point
on
this
one,
i
take
it,
is
look,
all
congress
wanted
is
to
give
you
the
18
months
if
there's
no
other
coverage
in
the
family.
unknown
speaker
that's...
all
right.
and
if
there
is...
now,
that...
if
we
bought
that
argument,
i
mean,
i
think
that
would
work
a
major
change
in
cobra,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
now,
aren't
lots
of
people
covered
with
two
policies
because
the
spouses
both
work,
or
not?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you...
you're
in
this...
i
mean,
just
speaking
out
of
your
experience,
this
is
your...
basically
i
gather
you're
represented
a
lot
of
these
cases.
are
most...
i
just...
on
the
basis
of
acquaintanceship,
it
seems
to
me
a
lot
of
people
have
both
spouses
working
and
they
each
have
a
policy
at
their
place
of
employment,
so
on
the
basis
of
that,
wouldn't
you
say
this
would
suddenly
make
this
18-month
business
pretty
meaningless,
if
we
accept
your
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
congress
really
intended
so
to
limit
the
18-months--you
know,
this
looks
like...
i
would
think
that
this
extra
18-month
safety
valve
that
they
build
in
would
in
vast
numbers
of
cases
become
meaningless,
and
wouldn't
we
expect
to
find
something
in
the
legislative
history,
or
some
place,
that
would
suggest
that
this
limitation,
so
major
a
limitation
was
intended?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
washburn,
under
the
cobra
scheme,
i
take
it
that
your
client,
the
insurance
company,
is
paid
a
premium
for
the
cobra
coverage.
it
isn't
as
though
it's
free.
unknown
speaker
how
is
that?
unknown
speaker
i
assume
you
make
that
back
from
the
employer
when
you
sell
the
employer
the
whole
package.
i
mean,
you've
got
to
get
it
from
somewhere.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
mean,
if
you're
losing
money
on
the
premiums
that
you
get
from
the
retired
employees,
or
the
terminated
employees--
unknown
speaker
--of
this
employer,
you
would
not
sell
insurance
to
this
employer
unless,
when
you
sell
insurance
to
the
employer,
you
get
enough
premiums
from
his
current
employees,
contributed
to
by
the
employer
or
not,
to
make
up
for
that
loss.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
know,
you're
happy.
it
works
out
okay.
unknown
speaker
it
comes
out
of
their
pockets.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
have
been
bothering
congress,
but
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
it...
you're
saying
it
shouldn't
bother
us
because
that's
not
the
case
here.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you're
saying
there's
another
ground
upon
which
you
ought
to
win
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
not
a
ground
that
was
passed
upon,
as
i
understand
it,
in
the
summary
judgment
that
was
entered.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
may
dictate
it,
but
the...
as
i
understand
it,
the
summary
judgment
was
not
entered
on
the
assumption
that
the
policy
coverage
to
which
the
statute
applies
is
as
you
have
just
described
it.
if
you
are
correct,
perhaps
there
is
another
basis
upon
which
you
should
win
this
case,
but
i
didn't
understand
that
to
be
the
basis
upon
which
summary
judgment
was
granted
here.
unknown
speaker
okay,
and
that's
a
different
issue.
that's
an
issue
of
law.
unknown
speaker
and
now,
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
you're
raising
an
issue
of
fact
under
the
policy
to
be
applied
to
that
law,
but
that
was
a
stage
to
which
the
lower
courts
never
progressed,
isn't
that
the
case,
or
am
i
misunderstanding
you?
unknown
speaker
you're
not
suggesting
those
hypothetical
facts
are
the
facts
of
this
case.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
you're
just
basically
saying
there
are
situations
in
which
there
could
be
a
preexisting
policy
but
yet
it
still...
that
policy
wouldn't
amount...
would
not
first
become
applicable,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
with
the
hypothetical...
i
mean,
that's
clever.
i
mean,
it's
a
very...
it's...
i
take
it
your
hypothetical
argument
is
that
there
will
be
a
bunch
of
cobra
policies
that
will
coexist
with
a
spouse's
pre...
you
know,
preexisting
policy,
and
now
when
cobra
ends
the
spousal's
policy
kicks
in
only
because
the
cobra
has
ended,
because
under
the
rules,
cobra
would
have
been
the
first
payor.
and
so
you're
saying
at
least
in
that
situation
the
spouse's
policy
became...
what's
the
word,
became--
unknown
speaker
--became
primary,
and
you
say
therefore
it
became...
first
became
coverage.
that's
your
argument.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
i
mean,
that's
the
hypothetical
argument.
all
right...
which
i
thought
was
a
very
interesting
argument,
and
my
concern
with
that
argument
is
simply
that
that
would
turn
the
statute
on
a
real
patchwork,
since
sometimes
the
cobra
policy
is
the
first
payor,
sometimes,
i
would
guess,
the
cobra
policy
is
the
second
payor,
and
you
couldn't
make
it,
and
sometimes
there
would
be
policies
in
respect
to
portions
of
which
the
cobra
would
be
the
first
and
portions
of
which
the
cobra
would
be
the
second.
so
if
we
accepted
that
argument,
what
we
had
read...
read
into
this
statute
would
be
a
hodge-podge,
and
nobody
would
probably
know
who
was
covered
under
what.
unknown
speaker
yes.
is
that...
yes.
unknown
speaker
this
is
not
a
coordination
of
benefits
provision,
and
this
is
probably
your...
your
hypothetical
is
probably
why
congress
did
not
key
this
to
primary
coverage.
it
just
said
coverage,
and
the
question
of
primary
coverage,
secondary
coverage,
is
something
to
be
thrashed
out
later
on.
isn't...
in
this
and
in
every
case.
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
but
could
you
explain
to
me,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
he
gets
sick.
he's
covered
under
your
company's
insurance
and
his
wife's
policy.
who
pays?
there
must
be
something
in
your
policy
and
their
policy
about
coordination
of
benefits.
unknown
speaker
that
any
other
insurance...
you
have
the,
i
would
think
that
you
insure
your
own
and
the
spouses
would
be
secondary,
but
you
say
no,
that...
if
you
employ
someone,
any
other
insurance
that
that
person
has
would
be
primary
and
not
yours?
unknown
speaker
what
body
of
law
determines
whether
you
shift
from
being
primarily
liable
as
the
employer
to
secondarily
liable?
you
said
something
about
a
model
code,
but
a
model
code
is
not
law
unless
somebody
enacts
it.
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
a
matter
determined
by
state
law
rather
than
erisa
law?
unknown
speaker
because
there,
there
is
a
difference
between
the
two
of
you
on
what
the
law
is,
i
thought.
maybe
i
misunderstood
mr.
weinhaus,
but
i
thought
he
said
that
the
employer,
even
with
cobra
coverage,
would
remain
the
primary
insurer
and
aetna
would
remain
the
secondary,
just
as
it
was
before.
unknown
speaker
mr.
washburn,
can
i
ask
you
just
to
comment
on
one
thing
that
the
other
side
raised,
the
significant
gap
argument,
that
they
say
under
your
view
you
have
a
significant
gap
problem.
under
their
view
the
injured...
the
ill
person
makes
the
decision
right
away
and
there
isn't
a
significant
gap
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
if
there
is
a
significant
gap,
in
your
view,
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
washburn.
mr.
weinhaus,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
mr.
weinhaus,
could
you...
i
meant
to
ask
this
of
mr.
feldman,
too,
but
maybe
you
can
satisfy
me.
i...
you
and
he
have
given
some
reasons
why
this...
it
makes
sense
to
read
first
becomes
as
you
do
with
regard
to
(i),
but
the
first
becomes
clause
also
applies
to
(ii),
first
becomes
after
the
date
of
the
election
in
the
case
of
a
qualified
beneficiary
other
than
a
qualified
beneficiary
described
in
section
11...
of
this
title,
entitled
to
benefits
under
medicare.
why
does
it
make
any
sense
to
say,
well,
we're...
the...
we're
going
to
allow
medicare
benefits
to
eliminate
your...
the
employer's
continuing
obligation
to
give
you
this
coverage,
but
only
if
those
medicare
benefits
first
become
available
after
the
election?
what's
the
reason
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
they
end
up
treating
the
two
of
them
the
same,
and
i
must
say,
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me
with
respect
to
medicare,
since
that's
mandatory.
i
mean,
it's
not
something
you
have
the
option
of
taking
on
or
not.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
