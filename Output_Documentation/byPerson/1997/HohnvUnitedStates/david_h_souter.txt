h.

of
course,
all
we
have
to
do,
i
suppose,
if
we
accept
your
view
of
house,
is
review
the
certificate
of
appealability
determination
and
stop
there.
we
don't
have
to
go
the
further
step,
do
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
one
of
the
issues
that's
arisen
is
whether
that
presents
any
different
situation
from
what
the
court
had
in
house.
i'm
sure
you've
seen
the
submission
from
the
other
side
on
that
point.
do
you
have
anything
further
to
add
on
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
maybe
we
have
another
problem.
i
mean,
we
assume
and
we
repetitiously
say
that
we
assume
that
congress
knows
what
we're
deciding
over
here.
there
was
a...
in
several
of
the
briefs
there
was
a
string
cite
to
the
cases
in
which
we
seem
to
have
honored
the
limitation
on
house,
i.e.,
no
statutory
cert,
very
much
in
the
breach
and
why
shouldn't
we
assume
that
congress
understood
that
and
would
therefore
quite
reasonably
have
assumed
that
we
were
going
to
exercise
statutory
cert
jurisdiction?
well,
i
know
one
answer
to
that
is,
you've
still
got
house
on
the
books.
well,
maybe
possibly
the
best
answer
in
a
totally
unsatisfactory
situation
is
to
say,
go
on
applying
house
even
if
you're
right
on
the
point
that
you
have
made
that,
in
fact,
there
has
been
one
change
in
the
law
since
house
and
that
is,
a
circuit
justice
can
do
what
a
circuit
justice
couldn't
do
then.
maybe
house
is
sort
of
the
best
way
out
of
a
messy
situation
for
which
there's
ultimately
no
satisfactory
answer
unless
we
go
back
and
reexamine
house.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
and
apply
it
here
whether
your
distinction
holds
up
or
not,
because
that's
the...
that's
in
effect
the
only
alternative
that
would
honor
what
i
suppose
was
a
congressional
expectation
without
taking
a
total
reexamination
of
house
itself.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they...
i
wouldn't
impute
to
congress
any
knowledge
that
we
had
somehow
formally
reexamined
house,
but
i
guess
i
do
think
we
should
impute
to
congress
the
knowledge
that
we
are,
in
fact,
reviewing
these
decisions,
that
we
are,
in
fact,
acting
as
if
we
had
statutory
cert
jurisdiction
in
certain
of
these
cases
and
my
imputation
of
knowledge
doesn't
go
beyond
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
it
goes
that
far,
then
it's
difficult,
it
seems
to
me,
to
argue,
as
i
think
you
were
suggesting,
that
there
is
a
kind
of
overwhelming
restrictive
premise
in
aedpa
which
goes
so
far
as
to
assume,
or
as
to
include
a
congressional
assumption
that
we
could
not
review
in
these
circumstances.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
are
single
cases
in
which
we
apparently
were
doing
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
didn't
say
so.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
didn't
discuss
it,
but
we
did
it,
didn't
we?
