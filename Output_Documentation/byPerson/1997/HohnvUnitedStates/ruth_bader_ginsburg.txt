mr.
roberts,
may
i
ask
you
about
an
earlier
piece
of
this
somewhat
confusing
puzzle?
at
the
circuit
court
level,
judge
mcmillian
said,
i
would
grant
the
certificate
of
appealability.
could
he
have
done
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
the
circuit's
practice,
but
the
circuit's
practice
could
be
otherwise
compatibly
with
the
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
thank
you.
what...
to
go
back
for
a
second,
what
is
it
that
makes
this
a
screening
mechanism?
is
it
that
it
goes
to
one
judge?
is
that
the
reason
that
it's...
you
call
it
a
screening
mechanism?
i
take
it
it's
not
the
simple
fact
that
the
jurisdictional
issue
has
to
be
decided
first,
or
that
the
certificate
of
appealability
issue
has
to
be
decided
first.
it
must
be
that
it's
directed
to
one
judge.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
wasn't
because
of
where
it
was
located,
whether
in
the
court
of
appeals,
except
22...
in
1292(b)
congress
has
made
it
highly
discretionary
at
two
levels,
and
you've
got
to
have
them
both.
and
it
can't
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
unless
the
district
judge
puts
it
there,
and
if
the
court
of
appeals
says
no,
then
it's
out.
but...
so
i
don't
understand
the
analogy
to
1292(b).
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
1292(b)
is
a
question
of
when,
not
whether.
1292(b)
is
a
purely,
should
it
be
reviewed
now.
it
can
be
reviewed
later,
so
it's
only
a
question
of
interrupting
an
ongoing
proceeding.
that's
why
i
don't
see
these...
you
are
raising
a
now
or
never
issue.
either
you
get
the
certificate
and
you
can
present
your
question,
or
you
don't,
and
you
never
can.
1292(b)
is
simply
a
timing
question.
it
doesn't
say
in
any
way
that
you
can't
bring
up
the
issue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
will
concede
that
house
was
a
rather
skimpy
opinion.
it
was
per
curiam
and
there
was
no
opposition,
and
it
wasn't
a
very
well
aired
case,
was
it?
