justice
antonin
scalia
might
have
made
a
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
especially
in
a
case
entitled
united
states
v.
nixon,
or
nixon
v.
fitzgerald,
and
that's
why
we
have
that
rule,
that
where
we
haven't
thought
and
spoken
about
jurisdiction
you
shouldn't
draw
any
conclusions
from
our
entertaining
of
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
that's
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
just
lost
me.
i
have
always
assumed
that
it
meant
in
aid
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
in
the
particular
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
it
means
in
aid
of
somehow
the
court's
role
in
the
society,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that
one
could
be
handled
by...
by--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
the
application
to
a
justice,
who
could
refer
it
to
the
whole
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
penner,
why
wouldn't
referral
by
the
circuit
justice
to
the
full
court
suffice
to
protect
the
appellate
jurisdiction
in
the
sky
aspect
of
the
whole
thing?
why
wouldn't
that
be
sufficient?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
not,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
burden
is
on
you
if
you
want
to
have
an...
you
know,
an
original
writ
issued
to
show
that
it
is
necessary
and
that
there's
no
other
way
to
get
this
thing
done.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
think
if
we
agree
with
you
that
you
can
get
a...
you
know,
a
certiorari
writ
when
you
do
get
an
application
to
a
single
justice,
and
i
probably
get
more
of
them
than
anybody
else,
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
all
of
these
cosmic
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
that
one
of
the
disadvantages
of
not
agreeing
with
you
on
the
certiorari
point
is
that
each
justice
to
whom
an
application
is
submitted
would
have
to
worry
about
such
questions
as
establishing
what
the
law
ought
to
be
in
circuit
conflicts
and
all
of
that.
whereas
i
assume
the
consequence
is,
the
unuttered
consequence,
if
i
agree
with
you,
then
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
that
any
more.
when
i
get
these
individual
applications,
all
i
have
to
think
about...
and
i
should
never
refer,
never
have
to
think
about
referring
it
to
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
could...
but
how
does
that
work?
the
court
would
grant
certiorari
limited
to
that
one
issue,
and
the
other
issues
could
not
be
presented
to
the
justice
in
chambers?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
letter
you
filed.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
was
very
good
when
i
read
it.
i
was
wondering
what
you
were
going
to
say
in
response.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutton,
shouldn't
we
just
stick
to
the
language
of
the
statute?
will
you
be
willing
to
wager
that
more
than
2
percent
of
the
members
of
congress
ever
heard
of
house?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
explanation
for
the
dearth
of
any
applications
in
that
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutton
said
there
was.
