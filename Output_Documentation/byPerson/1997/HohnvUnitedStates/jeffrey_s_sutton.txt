mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
same
time
congress
in
1996
was
most
conspicuously
streamlining
habeas
review,
the
federal
government
and
petitioner
having
proposed
an
interpretation
of
that
legislation
that
multiplies
by
a
factor
of
two
or
three
the
avenues
of
appellate
relief
available
to
individual
federal
prisoners
or
state
prisoners.
the
twin
vehicles
for
this
development
are
1)
a
theory
of
statutory
certiorari
that
has
never
received
the
vote
of
a
single
justice
of
this
court
and
has
been
positively
rejected
by
several
decisions
of
this
court
and,
second,
a
theory
of
common
law
certiorari
that
has
not
been
used
meaningfully
in
an
opinion
by
this
court
since
the
end
of
world
war
ii.
it
would
seem
quite
anomalous
to
resurrect
the
one
theory
and
create
the
other
in
the
one
area
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
that
is
now
most
expressly
regulated
by
congress.
i
submit
that
that's
not
what
happened.
i'd
like,
justice
breyer,
to
address
your
question
about...
and
the
nixon
cases.
the
key
difference
between
the
nixon
cases
and
this
one
is
the
gate
keeping
decision
is
really
not
a
jurisdiction
decision.
yes,
it
ultimately
may
have
jurisdictional
consequences,
but
keep
in
mind,
when
a
court
of
appeals
judge
denies
the
certificate,
that
does
not
mean
no
jurisdiction.
the
inmate
can
go
to
this
court,
obtain
a
certificate...
at
that
point
there
might
be
jurisdictional
consequences,
but
of
course
at
that
point
the
review
that
is
being
sought
is
not
just
of
what
the
circuit
judge
did,
but
also
of
what
that
circuit
justice
did.
that's
extremely
odd.
i'm
not
aware
of
another
jurisdictional
statute
where
individuals,
whether
inmates
or
not,
can
argue
that
a
court
of
appeals
made
a
mistake
in
a
court
of
appeals
panel
or
a
court
of
appeals
judge
where
this
court
has
already
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at
the
matter.
that's
quite
unusual.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
of
course,
it
is
being
made
by
a
circuit
judge,
but
i
would
submit--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--the
circuit
judge
is
obviously
in
his
chambers.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but
your
honor,
actually...
but
actually,
your
honor,
your
question
gets
to
a
fundamental
point.
the
aedpa
is
not
an
exercise
in
metaphysics.
the
aedpa
requires
a
straight--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--consistent
interpretation--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
think
for
the
same
reason
that
this
court
would
not
review
a
1292(b)
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals.
for
example,
let's
say
that
a
trial
court
decided
to
issue
a
certificate
saying
that
an
issue
of
law
ought
to
go
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
the
court
of
appeals
has
discretion
to
decide
at
that
point
whether
to
take
the
issue
of
law.
they
don't
have
to,
and
if
that
court
of
appeals
does
not
take
that
issue,
it's
not
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
this
court
cannot
review
it,
and
there's
no
decision
to
the
contrary.
but
another
critical
point
here,
you
know--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
maybe
i'm...
i
may
be
misunderstanding
the
question,
your
honor,
but
it
really
seems
quite
similar.
it
seems
to
be
another
type
of
gate
keeping
function
that
is
pre
jurisdictional
in
nature,
and
then
after
all
the
whole
function
of
1292
and
2253
is
utterly
destroyed
if
one
can
review
each
of
these
decisions.
what
ends
up
happening
is,
instead
of
narrowing
and
streamlining--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
since
i'm
not
getting
very
far
on
that
analogy,
let
me
try
to
make
another
point.
2253
creates
another
implication
that
i
think
undercuts
the
1254
argument
that
has
been
made,
and
that's
the
implication
created
by
the
fact
that
when
the
inmate
goes
to
a
court
of
appeals
judge
the
game
is
not
over
if
the
certificate
is
denied.
2253,
after
all,
does
say
it
can
be
brought
to
a
circuit
justice
and,
if
necessary,
referred
to
the
whole
court.
i
think
that
creates
a
very
strong
implication
that
when
you're
dissatisfied
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
panel
or
judge
does,
that's
how
you
resolve
the
matter.
you
don't...
you're
not
left
with
twin
and
possibly
three
routes
of
review.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
this
is
the
question
as
to
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
in
1945?
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes,
your
honor.
i
most
definitely
do.
i
would
argue
that
the
state
of
the
law
has
changed
quite
significantly
and,
in
fact,
dispositively
since
1945
and
specifically
since
the
changes
in
1948.
i
filed
a
letter
with
ms.
nelson,
with
the
clerk's
office,
that
indicates
that
the
1911
act,
that
section
293
of
the
1911
act
makes
clear
that
the
very
definition
that
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
relying
upon
does
not
apply
and
did
not
apply
to
the
habeas
statutes.
what
that
section
says
is
the
term
title
only
refers
to
this
act,
and
the
1911
act
did
not
deal
with
the
habeas
statutes
and
most
specifically
did
not
deal
with
the
1908
gate
keeping
function
that
we're
now
dealing
with
and
was
first
enacted
in
that
year,
so...
but
i
would
submit
that's
not
all.
one
can
read
house
alone,
and
i
would
submit
that
in
1945
there
was
no
better
discerner
of
the
state
of
the
law
than
this
court
in
1945,
and
the
beginning
of
the
house
decision
at
page
43
makes
it
quite
clear
that
their
understanding
of
the
law
is
that
the
only
place
to
go
is
the
district
court
judge
and
the
court
of
appeals.
there's
not
a
single
mention
of
whether
one
can
go
to
a
circuit
justice.
in
fact,
they
quote
the
very
statute,
28
u.s.c.
466,
upon
which
i'm
relying
to
make
this
argument,
and
i'd
like
to
emphasize
this
point,
because
i
think
it
offers--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
they
all
get
respect
from
me
anyway,
your
honor,
and
i--
[laughter]
i
would
add...
i
would
add
that
there's
been
nothing
to
suggest
in
any
decision
since
then
that
house
was
wrongly
decided,
and
i
think
what's
important
about
this
matter
is
this--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--excuse
me.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely
not,
your
honor,
and
i'm
glad
i
have
a
chance
to
deal
with
that
issue.
the
clear
statement
provision,
2244,
was
needed
precisely
because
of
the
main
case
on
which
the
federal
government
and
petitioner
rely,
house.
the
statutory
scheme
in
house
was
just
like
2244
would
have
read
without
a
clear
statement.
2244
says,
if
you
want
permission
for
a
second
habeas,
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
get
permission.
it
says...
would
have
said
nothing
about
a
justice,
nothing
about
supreme
court
review.
that's
the
house
statute,
and
because
house
was
on
the
books,
congress
quite
smartly
said
we're
going
to
avoid
all
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--they
didn't--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--they
didn't
need
to,
because
under
statutory
certiorari
every
single
decision
of
this
court,
every
single
decision
of
the
court
that
was
on
the
books
indicated
that
there
was
no
statutory
certiorari
jurisdiction,
so
they
didn't
need
a
clear
statement
there
and,
precisely
because,
as
i
indicated
in
responding
to
justice
souter's
question,
the
law
had
changed
since
19--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--sufficiently
clear
to
not
need
a
clear
statement,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but,
your
honor,
let's...
well,
i
think
the
law
was
settled
as
to
statutory
certiorari.
i
don't
think
anyone's
arguing
that
the
law
was
settled
on
that
point.
the
harder
question,
i
agree
with
you,
is
whether
the
law
was
settled
as
to
common
law
certiorari
in
light
of
the
house
decision.
there's
one
body
of
government
that
would
have
noted...
known
whether
they
needed
a
clear
statement
in
1996.
it
would,
after
all,
have
been
congress,
because
congress
is
the
one
that
changed
the
law
in
1948
and
said
quite
clearly
if
you're
unhappy
with
the
court
of
appeals
gate
keeping
decision
go
to
a
circuit
justice
and,
if
necessary,
the
whole
court.
so
i...
you
know...
you're...
i'm
not
happy
with
the
look
you're
giving
me
but
i
do
think
that--
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
maybe
i'm
not
making
clear
why--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
i'm
sure
that
it's
an
opposite
problem.
the
thing
i'm
trying
to
emphasize
is
that,
with
house
on
the
books,
if
you
have
a
statute
that
just
says
go
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
nothing
else,
that
would
have
allowed
common
law
certiorari.
an
inmate
would
have
come--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--under
settled
law--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor,
because
the
statutes
changed.
there's
not
a
single
all
writs
precedent
in
over
210
years
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
which
they
granted
all
writs
relief,
whether
common
law
certiorari
or
any
other--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i'm
not
sure
i
follow
that.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
because
house
was
still
on
the
books.
i
don't
have
to
worry
in
2253
because
the
statute
had
changed
and
had
given
the
inmate
another
available
route
for
relief.
there's
no
all
writs
act
precedent
with
which
i'm
aware,
or
that
has
been
cited
by
petitioner
or
the
federal
government--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--yes,
absolutely.
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
but,
your
honor,
that's
house.
i
mean,
unless
you're
going
to
overrule
house,
that's
exactly
what
house
says.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
i
think
i've
kept
track
of
that.
the--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--that
is
the
letter
i
filed.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
their
argument...
i
want
to
make
sure
i've
made
their
argument
clear,
because
i
don't
think
i
did
the
first
time
through.
their
argument
is
that
the
phrase,
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--in
1945
included
a
justice
of
this
court.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
so
that's
their
argument,
and
to
make
that
argument
they've
looked
to
a
definition
they
found
in
title
28
that
says,
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
can
include
circuit
justice,
so
at
that
point,
that's
a
pretty
good
argument.
now,
the
response
to
it
is
the
letter
i
filed--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--the
response
to
it
is
that
that
definition
comes
from
the
1911
act
the
congress
enacted
that
dealt
with
the
judicial
code.
now,
the
1911
act
did
not
deal
with
habeas,
did
not
modify
the
habeas
statutes
and,
most
notably,
did
not
modify
the
gate
keeping
provision,
but
the
critical
language
here,
and
this
is
the
filing
that
i
provided,
is
that
definition
says,
when
used
in
this
title,
all
right.
that
sounds
kind
of
broad.
it
sounds
like
all
of
title
28.
well,
it
turns
out
in
section
293
of
that
very
act
it
says
the
word
title
only
refers
to
this
act.
in
other
words,
only
the
1911
act,
so
that...
that
argument's
gone.
that
argument
doesn't
exist.
but
justice
breyer,
i
can
confirm
it
by
common
sense.
since
1948
when
the
law
was
changed
you've
got,
i
think
it's
17
different
reported
decisions
by
this
court
concerning
applications
for
certificate
of
probable
cause
that
were
denied
or
granted.
between
1925
and
1948
there's
not
a
single
one.
there's
not
a
single
piece
of
evidence
in
that
23-year
period
that
one
could
go
to
a
justice.
and
again,
if
one
looks
at
house
itself,
page
43
of
house,
this
court
was
construing
the
state
of
the
law
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
in
other
words,
are
you
saying
that
they
would
have
wanted
to
preserve
the
jurisdiction
for
the
rare
case,
or
why
would
they
eliminate--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
right.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
as
the
powell
commission
report
indicated,
direct
review
was
not
working
and
has
not
been
working.
one
of
the
critical
problems
that
the
aedpa
tries
to
address
is
the
fact
that
there
are
frivolous
habeas
petitions
that
are
occupying
the
court's
time
and
government
time
when,
in
fact,
its
time
would
be
much
better
spent
focusing
on
the
petitions
that
have
merit.
the
second
reason
they
would
have
wanted
to
single
out
this
class
of
cases
is
that
their
whole
objective...
that
is,
streamlining
review...
doesn't
work
if
you
leave
other
avenues
of
review
open.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
absolutely,
and
to
be
terminated.
that's
exactly
right.
it's
not
just
streamlining
review
and
making
sure
it's
efficient
and
that
the
courts
focus
on
the
claims
with
merit,
but
those
claims
with
merit
are
done
after
the
inmate
has
had
one
fair
opportunity
before
the
district
court
juge.
i
think
that
makes
sense.
but
i
think
the
other
problem,
i
mean,
if
one
doesn't
adopt
this
interpretation,
are
some
of
the
administrative
problems
that
arise
when
you've
got
not
just
applications
to
the
circuit
justice
available
but
common
law
and
statutory
certiorari
available,
so
you've
got
two
and
three
tracks
of
review,
not
about
the
merits
but
about
this
gate
keeping
decision.
the
whole...
the
only
reason--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
we...
i
don't--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
if...
once
the
court
says
there's
power,
that
message
will
get
to
the
inmates,
and
the
inmates
will
say,
if
there's
power,
there's
always
a
reason
to
file,
and
filings
experience
has
shown
are
not
always
based
on
whether
there's
merit,
so
i
think
one
of
the
fundamental
goals
of
the
act
would
be
undermined.
but
i'm
not
sure
the
court
could
say
just
all
writs
act
jurisdiction
is
available.
the...
2253
is
on
the
books
and
2253
does
allow
for
applications
to
circuit
justices
and
by
referral
to
the
court.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
no,
i
do,
and
i
guess
the
point
i'm
making,
and
perhaps
not
very
well,
is
that
if
you
allow
all
writs
act
jurisdiction
on
top
of
that,
you're
left
with
two
track
review.
you're
left--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--when
you
say
leave
house
on
the
books,
you're
including
the
all
writs
act
interpretation--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
your
honor,
a
couple
of
things.
i
think
one
thing
i
want
to
make
clear
which
i
hope
is
responsive
to
this
question,
i'm
not
aware
of
a
single
issue
that
will
escape
review
by
the
circuit
justice
route,
so
i
can't
imagine
any
reason,
any
customary
reason
for
preserving
all
writs
act
power
in
this
area.
i
know
of
no
precedent
where
this
court
allows
all
writs
act
power
where
there's
already
another
statutory
mechanism
either
for
preserving
this
court's
jurisdiction
or
resolving
some
drastic
problem--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no.
i
think
that
would
be
left
to
the
practices
of
the
court.
the
practice
that
i
think
the
court
would
adopt
is
the
one
i
think
it's
been
using
at
least
for
the
last
20
years
without
exception,
is
that
circuit
justices
do
not
act
on
their
own
and
say,
great,
i
don't
have
to
worry
about
the
other
eight.
they
act
as
surrogates--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--perhaps
i'm
wrong
in
this
understanding,
but
i
had
always
thought
circuit
justices
act
as
surrogates
for
the
whole
court,
so
that
they
did
not
take...
keep
in
mind
just
their
own
views
of
a
particular
matter
but
are
sensitive
to
what
other
justices
may...
how
they
may
view
the
matter.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
well,
again,
i'm...
i
don't
want
to
suggest
what
the
court's
practices
should
be,
but--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
think
the
view
that
there's
no
loophole
is
the
trust
in
the
court
both
as
an
institution
and
as
its
body
of
nine
individual
justices.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
not
after
a
district--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--not
after
a
district...
keep
in
mind,
the
court
only
gets
involved
after
a
district
court
judge
in
most
circuits
has
denied
it
and
after
a
court
of
appeals
has
denied
it.
that's
the
only
opportunity,
and
i...
but
there's
always
a
risk
of
mistake.
i
suppose
there's
the
risk
of
a
mistake
even
of
a
precedent,
but
i
think
it's...
it
was
entirely
appropriate
for
congress
to
make
the
judgment
that
with
respect
to
this
problem
of
frivolous
habeas
claims
clogging
the
courts,
that
we
ought
to
expedite
review
of
those
that
don't
have
merit.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
as
this
court
indicated
in
burrell
in
1956,
that
is
up
to
the
court
of
appeals.
they're
entitled
to
establish
their
own
practice
that
says
individual
judges--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--it
depends
on
that
court
of
appeals'
rules
and
practices.
not
necessarily.
i
think
it
could
quite
plausibly
be
the
case.
i'm
not
aware
of
a
circuit
that
has
this
practice,
but
it
could
be
the
case--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--no,
your
honor.
i
mean,
it's
something
they've
been
doing
for
quite
a
while.
in
fact,
longer
than
this
court
has
been
doing
it,
since
1925.
this
has
been
something
that
they've
had
to
manage.
congress
was
aware,
justice
souter,
to
get
back
to
your
question,
of
how
they
managed
it
and
i
think
the
question
of
decisions
by
this
court,
where
there's
no
discussion
of
jurisdiction,
can't
plausibly
create
an
implication
that
congress
knew
about
those
decisions
that
the
court
itself
had
not
decided
to
address
in
terms
of
jurisdiction--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--well,
i
think
there
clearly
is
when
it
comes
to
statutory
certiorari,
because
there's
not
a
single
case
that
discusses
that
issue
and
says
there
is--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--but,
your
honor--
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
--i
don't
mean
to
quibble,
but
as
between
decisions
that
discuss
the
issue
and
decisions
that
silently
ignore
it,
i
think
the
better
rule
is
to
assume
congress
knows
about
the
decisions
that
discuss
the
issue.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
your
honor,
i've
no
idea,
as
you
will
agree,
what
they
meant
or
what
they
knew,
but
that's
exactly
why
we
give
them
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
s.
sutton
thank
you.
