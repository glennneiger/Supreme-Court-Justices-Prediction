mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
united
states
believes
there
are
two
reasons
that
this
court
should
adhere
to
house
v.
mayo
and
hold
that
it
may
issue
a
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
to
review
the
action
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case.
the
first
reason
is
stare
decisis.
the
second
reason
is
that
a
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
is
the
most
practical
available
way
to
correct
important
legal
questions
such
as
the
proper
standard
for
issuing
certificates.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
this
court
in
its
discretion
would
decline
to
issue
a
writ
of
certiorari
when
there
was
a
plain
intent
to
preclude
review,
but
in
this
case
there
isn't
a
plain
intent
to
preclude
review.
section
2253
only
discusses...
only
precludes
appeals
as
of
right
to
the
courts
of
appeals
on
the
merits
of
a
section
2255
motion.
it
doesn't
discuss
certiorari
jurisdiction,
it
doesn't
discuss
this
court's
jurisdiction,
and
it
doesn't
discuss
review
of
the
question--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
is
the
government's
position
that
house
was
correct
and
the
court
doesn't
have
statutory
certiorari,
but
the
codification
of
statutory
certiorari
did
not
repeal
this
court's
ability
under
the
all
writs
act
to
exercise
common
law
certiorari.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction,
and--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--well,
it's
not
to
substitute
for
that
to
give
the
court
jurisdiction.
it's
in
aid
of
the
jurisdiction
that
may
have
wrongfully
precluded
by
an
incorrect
decision
by
the
court
of
appeals,
keeping
the
case
out
of
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
house
v.
mayo
held
that
the
case
was
not
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
well,
it's
certainly
a
close
question,
justice
breyer,
as
to
whether
an
application
for
a
certificate
is
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
there's--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it's
a
distinction,
and
the
distinction
is
that
here
congress
has
set
up
a
two
stage
process
with
a
screening
mechanism
to
decide
whether
petitioner's
case
is
in
the
court
of
appeals.
it
would
be
odd
to
consider
the
application
to
that
screening
mechanism
to
be
itself
a
case
that
brings
the
petitioner's
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
so
that
would
be
the
reasoning
in
house
and
in
the
other
cases
that
consider
a
leave
to
appeal
not
to
be
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
house
holds
that
the
court
has
jurisdiction
to
review
the
denial
of
the
certificate
and,
if
it
determines
that
the
certificate
was
improperly
denied,
to
review
the
merits.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
and
that
is
our
position
here.
the
government's
position
is
that
this
issue
was
decided
in
house
and
that
the
court
should
adhere
to
house,
because
stare
decisis
is
particularly
strong
in
cases
like
this
one,
which
turn
on
statutory
interpretation.
and
congress
has
revisited
all
these
statutes.
it's
revisited
the
all
writs
act,
the
certiorari
statute,
and
section
2253
several
times
since
house,
yet
congress
has
made
no
changes
to
any
of
the
statutes
that
indicate
any
disagreement
with
house.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
no.
in
fact,
that's
why
we
believe
that
a
common
law
certiorari
is
the
most
efficient
means
to
decide
these
questions,
because
in
the
context
of
acting
on
an
original
certificate,
an
original
application
for
a
certificate,
the
court
wouldn't
be
able
to
stop
there.
the
court
would
have
to
review
the
entire
case,
the
court
would
have
to
decide
all
the
legal
issues
that
are
necessary
to
determine
whether
there's
a
substantial
constitutional
issue,
and
the
court
would
have
to
apply
those
legal
standards
to
the
facts
of
the
case
and
determine
whether
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
a
certificate
on
the
facts
of
the
case,
and
that
would
be
a
very
cumbersome
method
to
achieve
clarification
of
the
standard
for
issuing
certificates.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
congress
intended
that.
congress
didn't
say
that
in
2253
that
that
was
the
method
of
review
that
should
be
used
and,
in
fact,
in
another
provision
of
the
aedpa,
congress
expressly
revoked
the
court's
certiorari
power
to
review
orders
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
authorize
or
deny
the
filing
of
successive
habeas
petitions.
so
congress
was
aware
of
how
to
limit
this
court's
certiorari
power
if
it
intended
to
do
so,
but
it
chose
not
to
do
so
here.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
the
government
opposed
that
on
two
grounds.
first,
that
adequate
relief
is
available
from
another
source
and,
second,
the
petitioner
hasn't
presented
exceptional
circumstances.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
the
exceptional
circumstances
are
not
met
in
the
case
of
a
certificate
because
the
petitioner
hasn't
demonstrated
an
entitlement
to
a
certificate.
i
think
that
that
just
proves
the
point
that
i
was
making
before,
that
the
certificate
context
requires
the
court
to
do
more
than
the
certiorari
context.
in
the
certiorari
context
there
are
exceptional
circumstances
because
there's
no
other
way
to
clarify
the
standard
in
2253(c)(2)
for
when
a
certificate
should
issue.
but
in
the
case
of
a
certificate,
what
would
be
required
to
show
exceptional...
exceptional
circumstances,
excuse
me,
is
that
the
petitioner
clearly
merits
the
certificate
and
that
it's
been
denied
by
the
lower
courts,
and
petitioner
can't
show
that
in
this
instance
because
petitioner
hasn't
proffered
any
evidence
to
show
actual
innocence
and
petitioner
can't
show
cause
to
excuse
petitioner's
procedural
default.
that's
the
government's
position.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it
is
an
oddity
of
the
way
the
applications
for
a
certificate
work.
an
individual
circuit
judge
could
grant
a
certificate,
but
the
practice
in
the
eighth
circuit
is
to
refer
the
applications
for
a
certificate
to
a
panel
of
the
court,
and
in
this
case
it
was
referred
to
a
panel
of
the
court
and
two
of
the
judges
on
the
panel
determined
that
a
certificate
should
not
issue,
and
so
that
was
controlling.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
yes.
the
circuit's
practice
could
be
otherwise...
this
court
in
in
re
burwell
held
that
it
was
up
to
the
individual
courts
of
appeals
to
determine
whether
a
request
for
a
certificate
should
be
decided
by
an
individual
circuit
judge,
by
a
panel,
or
conceivably
by
the
whole
court.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
it's
that
congress
has
set
up
a
separate
process
to
determine
whether
the
case
can
go
forward,
and
has
explicitly
mandated
that
unless
the
petitioner
survives
that
hurdle,
the
case
can't
go
forward.
in
the
nixon
case
the
jurisdiction
question
and
the
merits
were
one
case,
and
so
the
jurisdiction
question
was
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
the
notice
of
appeal
was
filed.
