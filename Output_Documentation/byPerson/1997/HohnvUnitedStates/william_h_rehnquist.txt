chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-8986,
arnold
hohn
v.
the
united
states.
ms.
penner,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
nixon
case
discuss
the
jurisdictional
point
at
length?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
our
rule
is
that
jurisdiction
that
has
been
assumed
without
any
elaborate
discussion
is
not
really
to
be
regarded
as
contradicting
a
prior
case
that
did
discuss
jurisdiction.
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
our
precedents
say
that
if
jurisdiction
is
assumed
sub
silentio,
without
a
discussion
of
the
jurisdiction,
that
simply
doesn't
count.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
about
a
motion
before
the
court
of
appeals
to
expedite
a
particular
case
for
hearing
before
the
court
of
appeals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
don't
you
run
in
there,
ms.
penner,
to
our
cases
that
say
that
piecemeal
appeals
are
frowned
upon?
you
know,
the
final
judgment
rule
and
that
sort
of...
and
here
you're
saying,
we
can
carve
out
what
one...
many
people
might
think
was
simply
one
case
into
two
cases.
one
is
the
certificate
of
probable
cause
application
and
the
other
is
the
merits.
but
doesn't
that
just
bifurcate
things
that
we
have
said
in
other
contexts
should
not
be
bifurcated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--do
you
really
think
that
congress
in...
having
thought
about
this
thing
intended
that
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
a
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
not
to
grant
a
certificate
of
probable
cause
or
a
certificate
of
appealability?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
has
to...
those
have
to
be
an
aid
of
jurisdiction,
do
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
by
hypothesis
here
we
would
not
have
jurisdiction
under
the
statutory
certiorari?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
wouldn't
it
be
rather
hard
to
say
that
that
was
an
aid
of
our
jurisdiction
if
it
was...
if
our
jurisdiction
depended
on
issuing
that
writ?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
maybe
that's
what
congress
wanted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
speaking
about...
of
that
and
whatever
else
is
applicable.
i
mean,
to
say
that
this
particular
result
would
obtain
is
not
necessarily
an
argument
against
that
result,
it
seems
to
me,
if
that's
what
congress
wanted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
issuance
of
a
certificate
of
appealability
by
a
justice
of
this
court
could
accomplish
much
the
same
purpose
as
you
say
that
accomplishes,
couldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
its
appellate
functions
are
defined
by
congress,
are
they
not?
there
isn't
some
big
appellate
function
up
there
in
the
sky
that
we
can
assume
that...
it's
just
what
congress
says
it
should
be,
subject
to
the
exceptions
that
congress
may
provide.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
see
as
the
test
of
a
certificate
of
appealability,
ms.
penner?
if
i'm
a
circuit
justice
for
the
fourth
circuit,
ought
i
to
decide
to
grant
a
certificate
of
appealability
only
if
there's
some...
only
if
this
court
would
review
it?
or
perhaps
more
broadly,
if
i
think
the
thing
is
arguably
one...
you
know,
you
could
make
up
your
mind
one
of
two
ways,
before
the
court
of
appeals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
and
i
mean,
would
a
justice
of
this
court
apply
the
same
standard
that
a
judge
of
the
court
of
appeals
applies?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
penner.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
congress
had
said
that,
you
know,
this
court
is
going
to
review
cases
by
certiorari
and
define
the
terms
and
the
time
limits
and
so
forth?
do
you
think
that
we
could
issue
a
common
law
writ
of
certiorari
for
a
case
where
someone
didn't
comply
with
the
requirements
to
seek
statutory
certiorari?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
couldn't
one
infer
from...
perhaps
not
even
infer,
but
the...
part
of
the
holding
of
house
v.
mayo
is
that
we
don't
have
statutory
certiorari
jurisdiction
here.
why
shouldn't
that
be
the
end
of
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
aid
of
its
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
we
don't
have
statutory
certiorari
jurisdiction,
why
should
we
be
able
to
use
another
writ
to
simply
substitute
for
that
to
give
us
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
sutton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
congress
wanted
cases
deemed
frivolous
by
lower
court
judges
to
cease.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
the
practice
be
any
different
in
the
courts
of
appeals
than
under
the
old
certificate
of
probable
cause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
sutton,
you
were
appointed
as
amicus
curiae
by
this
court
and
we
thank
you
for
your
performance
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
penner,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
it's
vitally
important
that
that
be
the
same
nation
wide,
that
one
court
of
appeals
follow
one
practice,
it
would
be
terrible
if
the
other
followed
the
other
practice?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
penner.
the
case
is
submitted.
