justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
there's
much
more
discussion
of
jurisdiction
in
those
opinions
than
in
house
v.
mayo.
justice
john
paul
stevens
house
v.
mayo,
they
didn't
even
get
a
response
from
the
state,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there
has
been
one
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
has
been
one
thing,
and
maybe
you
would
comment
on
it.
congress
in
22...
which
is
it?
i
get
the
sections
mixed
up.
but
anyway,
there's
a
section
in
here
that
says
there
can
be
no
appeal
or
review
of
a
denial
of
a
second
or
successive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly,
that...
congress
could
have
omitted
that
entirely
and
the
law
would
have
been
exactly
the
same.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
didn't
they
do
it
as
to
the
first
habeas
as
well
as
the
second,
then--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
make
it
perfectly
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
view
is
they
needed
a
clear
statement
for
a
second
successive
but
they
didn't
need
one
for
a
first
habeas
because
that
law
was
already
very
clear
with
respect
to
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
find
that
rather
puzzling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
probably
you
can't,
because
i...
you
still
seem
to
think
that
it
was
absolutely
necessary
to
spell
out
that
there
shall
be
no
review
of
the
denial
of
a
second,
but
there's
no
need
to
do
it
for
the
denial
of
a
first
because
the
law
was...
i
just
find
that
mind
boggling.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i'm
just
stupid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
that's
true
why
can't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that's
true,
why
can't
we
review
this
case?
if
you're
right
about
that,
then
we
should
review
on
common
law
certiorari.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
if
that's
true
you
don't
need
a
special
provision
for
the
second
habeas,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
understand,
under
that
argument,
why
it
was
necessary
for
congress
to
enact
a
grant
or
a
denial
of
an
authorization
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
file
a
second
or
a
successive
application
shall
not
be
appealable
and
shall
not
be
the
subject
of
a
petition
for
rehearing
or
for
a
writ
of
certiorari.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
are
you
saying...
let
me
just
be
sure
i...
you're
saying
that
if
they
had
not
enacted
(e),
they
could
have...
we
could
have
accepted
review
in
second
habeas
but
not
in
first?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
remarkable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
suggest
a
way
in
which
the
circuit
justice
might...
you
know,
it
takes
four
votes
to
grant
certiorari.
it's
very
often
we
grant
cert
on
the
basis
of
four
votes,
and
when
five
justices
think
it...
cert
should
be
denied.
now,
what
if
the
application
went
to
one
of
the
five
who
just
didn't
think
there
was
any
merit
to
it,
whereas
the...
all
eight
of
the
others
might
think
there
was?
i
don't
think
you
are
suggesting
the
circuit
justice
must
routinely
refer
everything
to
the
whole
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i've
acted
on
my
own
on
many,
many
occasions
where
i've
denied
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
but
i've
voted
to
grant
certiorari
when
i
thought...
or
i...
put
it
the
other
way.
i
voted
to
deny
when
i
didn't
think
anybody
would
be
interested
in
the
case
and
i
turned
out
to
be
wrong.
it
happens
very
often.
my
judgment
just
was
incorrect.
my
colleagues
thought
it
was
a
much
more
important
issue
than
i
did.
it
seems
to
me
that
could
happen
here
just
as
well,
unless
you
routinely
referred
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
argument
is
that
there
is
no
loophole,
that
everything
will
be
subject
to
review
by
the
court,
and
i
just
don't
think
it
would
be.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
assume
no
one
justice
will
make
a
mistake,
is
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i've
made
a
lot
of
them.
