justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
a
certificate
of
appealability
will
be
ordered?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
there's
a
lot
of
practice
after
that
that
seems
to
go
the
other
way,
so
if...
is
that
the
only
basis?
but
i
mean,
in
logic,
if
the
case
isn't
in
the
court
of
appeals
for
that
purpose,
then
why
is
a
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
denies
qualified
immunity
appeal?
why
would
that
be
in
the
court
of
appeals?
why
would
a
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
says,
we
think
that
you've
tried
to
appeal
under
a
collateral
order
exception
from
cohen,
but
we
think
you're
wrong,
why
would
that
case
be
in
the
court
of
appeals?
why
would
a
case
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
ever
says
we
don't
think
you
have
jurisdiction
to
appeal,
why
would
that
be
in
the
court
of
appeals?
in
other
words,
if
house
v.
mayo
is
right,
how
can
we
take
any
of
those
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
the
solicitor
general...
my
point
is,
the
solicitor
general
i
would
think
believes
that
we're
right
in
taking
those
cases
that
i've
mentioned.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
if
you
think
we're
right
in
taking
those
cases
that
i've
mentioned,
then
you
must
either
think
there's
a
distinction
from
house
v.
mayo,
or
you
must
think
house
v.
mayo
is
wrong,
so
which
is
it?
is
it
a
distinction?
if
so,
what
is
it,
or
is
house
v.
mayo
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
focus
right
on
that
decision,
there
is
a
decision
that
congress
is
asking
a
circuit
judge
to
make.
judge,
decide
if
a
certificate
of
appealability
should
issue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
decision.
where
is
that
decision
made?
when
i
was
a
circuit
judge
i
used
to
sit
in
my
office,
which
i
felt
was
in
the
court
of
appeals.
[laughter]
but
where,
metaphysically
speaking,
is
the
decision
being
made
to
issue
or
not
issue
the
certificate
of
appealability?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
where?
where
is
that
circuit
judge?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
so
where
would
you
say,
metaphysically,
with
congress
not
saying
to
the
contrary,
that
decision
was
being
made?
his
chambers
may
not
be
at
the
court
of
appeals.
i
mean,
many
judges
have
their
chambers
back
home
in
their
states
that
they--
--i'm
not...
i'm
speaking--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i'm
trying
to
get...
what
i'm
focusing
on
is
that
particular
decision,
and
i'm
trying
to
think
if
there's
some
reason
to
say,
no,
no,
that
decision
isn't
being
made
in
the
court
of
appeals.
i
grant
you
it's
being
made
by
one
judge
rather
than
three,
but
is
there
any
reason
for
saying
that
that
decision
by
the
one
judge
is
not
a
decision
that
is
being
made
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
house,
i
take
it
that
the
court
issued
all
writs
review,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
so
then
the
question
was,
well,
why
can't
we
do
that
in
this
decision
about
certificate
of
appealability,
and
i
take
it
your
answer
to
that
was,
well,
the
reason
they
issued
all
writs
review
before
is
because
there
was
no
other
way
to
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
here,
there
was
a
way
to
get
it
now.
the
way
to
get
it
now
is,
a
single
justice
can
issue--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
then
the
solicitor
general
says
in
respect
to
your
answer,
well,
that
isn't
really
so,
because
at
the
time
of
house
the
word
judge
included
single
justice,
so
there
was
a
way
of
reviewing
then,
just
as
there
is
now.
so
now
your
response
to
the
response
to
the
response
to
the
response
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
letter...
the
answer
to
that...
i
mean,
you
see,
they've
made
it
very
parallel.
i
mean,
they've
made
it
absolutely
parallel
to
house,
and
your
response
to
that
now
is
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
reason,
by
the
way,
since
you
brought
common
sense
into
it,
which
i
think
is
very
helpful,
is
there
any
reason
why
congress,
assuming
that
the
statute
language
allows
it,
would
have
singled
out,
out
of
all
the
things
this
court
can
review,
which
is
virtually
all
kinds
of
things,
is
there
any
reason
that
anybody
would
have
wanted
to
pick
out
this
set
of
cases,
which
would
have
let
so...
an
egregious,
really
controversial
refusal
to
grant
a
certificate
of
appealability
that's
the
kind
of
thing
we
might
review?
you
know,
the
court's
really
wrong,
or
it's
really
controversial,
there's
a
big
legal
issue
involved.
now,
out
of
all
the
things
we
review,
is
there
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
say,
that
alone
you
cannot
review?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
i
mean,
you're
arguing,
basically,
that
out
of
all
the
things...
we
can
review
all
sorts
of
things.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
assuming
the
language
allows
it,
the
all
writs
act,
or
whatever,
is
there
any
reason,
really,
congress
would
have
wanted
to
take
this
set
of
cases
and
say
no,
those
are
the
ones
you
can't
review--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
for
what
we
would
likely
review,
a
rare
instance
where
it
was
an
absolutely
wrong
grant,
refusal
to
grant
the
certificate,
or
there's
a
big
legal
issue
involved,
something
like--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
i
ask
you
a
quick
question?
if
we
accepted
the
sg's
idea
that
a
request
to
a
single
judge
in
a
circuit
is
not
in
the
circuit,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
would
that
also
apply
to
first
habeas
petitions?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
accept
the
position
that
it's
not
in...
is
it
all
right
if
i
ask
this,
chief--
all
right.
if
we
accept
the
position
of
the
sg
that
the
request
for
a
certificate
of
appeal,
you
know,
to
go
to
the
circuit
justice...
they're
saying
that
isn't
in
the
court
of
appeals,
right?
okay.
does
that
mean
for
purposes
of
habeas
corpus,
a
first
habeas
petition,
you
also
have
to
get
a
certificate,
don't
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
would
that
mean
that
we
would
then
be
unable
to
hear
denials
of
those
certificates,
too,
in
first
habeas?
