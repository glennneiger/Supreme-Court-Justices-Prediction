justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
think
in
light
of
house
v.
mayo,
i
think
it's
very
hard
to
argue
that
there
is
statutory
certiorari
jurisdiction
unless
we
want
to
overrule
that
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
your
view,
do
we
have
common
law
certiorari
jurisdiction
to
review
the
denial
of
a
court
of
appeal...
a
certificate
of
appealability
and
also
jurisdiction
to
review
the
merits
of
the
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that's
your
position
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
this
court
the
petitioner
applied
to
this
court
for
a
certificate
of
appealability,
or
at
least
to
a
justice,
did
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
that
the
government
opposed
that
on
the
grounds
that
the
petitioner
didn't
demonstrate
exceptional
circumstances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
yet
to
exercise
common
law
certiorari
jurisdiction
we
have
to
determine
there
are
exceptional
circumstances.
isn't
that
a
little
inconsistent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
you
just
have
all
writs
act
common
law
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
court
has
rarely
exercised
it.
it
doesn't
look
like
that's
a
big
problem,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
that
clearly
is
there
by
statute,
i
suppose.
you
concede
that.
