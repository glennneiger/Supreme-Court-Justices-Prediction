ms.
eileen
penner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
the
last
half
century
this
court
has
been
granting
writs
of
certiorari
to
review
erroneous
refusals
by
the
appellate
courts
to
allow
statutorily
authorized
and
meritorious
appeals.
that
historical
practice
is
fully
consonant
with
the
broad
jurisdictional
power
conferred
on
this
court
under
the
statutory
certiorari
provision,
section
1254,
and
residually
under
the
all
writs
act.
the
statutory
certiorari
provision
vests
this
court
with
the
power
to
review
all
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
over
which
those
courts
have
jurisdiction
regardless
of
the
condition
of
those
cases
and
irrespective
of
any
decision
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
have
made.
this
court
confirmed
in--
ms.
eileen
penner
--i
submit
that
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
has
already
called
into
very
serious
question
the
underpinnings
of
the
statutory
certiorari
decision
in
house.
house
suggested
that
no
case
could
be
in
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
certificate
had
been
denied
merely
because
the
statute
prohibited
an
appeal
from
entering
the
court
of
appeals
absent
a
certificate.
ms.
eileen
penner
it
did
not,
but
it--
ms.
eileen
penner
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
not
claim
that
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
has
even
sub
silentio
overruled
house
v.
mayo.
instead,
we
claim
that
it
implicitly
has
rejected
the
underpinnings
of
house
v.
mayo.
ms.
eileen
penner
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
the
court
made
a
decision
about
what
section
1254
means,
and
that
decision,
its
interpretation,
is
irreconcilable
with
the
holding
in
house.
were
the
court
to
reaffirm
the
statutory
certiorari
decision
in
house,
it
would
have
very
serious
implications
for
the
scope
of
the
section
1254
power
which
the
court
had
recognized
in
nixon.
if
a
case
is,
in
fact,
not
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
a
court
of
appeals
dismisses
for
lack
of
jurisdiction,
what
is
left
of
nixon?
nixon
decided
that
a
case
is
in
the
court
of
appeals
when
there
is
a
jurisdictional--
ms.
eileen
penner
--we
should
be--
ms.
eileen
penner
--the--
ms.
eileen
penner
--the
court
thought
very
carefully
about
its
jurisdiction
in
both
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
and
the
united
states
v.
nixon.
i...
the
cases
that
we
refer
to--
ms.
eileen
penner
--that's--
ms.
eileen
penner
--indeed,
that's
so,
and
the
petition
for
certiorari
was
written
by
house's
mother.
[laughter]
i...
we
submit
that
even
if
nixon
v.
fitzgerald
and
united
states
v.
nixon
are
not
the
best
authority
for
this
court,
if
the
court
is
concerned
that
there
was
inadequate
discussion
in
those
cases,
turning
to
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
alone
should
be
sufficient.
the
language
in
section
1254
is
as
broad
as
it
could
possibly
be,
and
we
submit
that
congress'
choice
of
the
language
in
section
1254
was
intentional.
it
conferred
jurisdiction
on
the
court
in
all
cases,
not
just
all
appeals,
but
all
cases,
all
matters,
all
judicial
proceedings
that
could
occur
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
that,
by
its
plain
terms,
would
include
proceedings
of
an
original
matter
in
the
courts
of
appeals
such
as
an
application
for
a
certificate
of
appealability.
ms.
eileen
penner
in
our
view
that
also
would
fall
within
the
plain
language.
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
here
is
the
jurisdictional
question
of
whether
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
power
under
section
2253
to
decide
the
merits,
to
allow
the
appeal
into
the
court
of
appeals.
that
is
exactly
analogous
to
the
decision
that
this
court
made
in
nixon
v.
fitzgerald,
that
the
predicate
jurisdictional
decision
to
dismiss
an
appeal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
was
itself
a
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
over
which
this
court
has
certiorari
power
under
section
1254.
ms.
eileen
penner
i
think
there
are
two
answers,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
first
is
that,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
bifurcation
it's
created
by
congress
itself,
which
mandated
the
creation
of
a
gate
keeping
provision
at
the
same
time
that
it
foreclosed--
ms.
eileen
penner
--review
of
an
appeal
unless
a
certain
thing
happened
in
that
gate
keeping
decision,
which
is
a
decision
to
allow
the
appeal
to
proceed,
but
the
second--
ms.
eileen
penner
--in
my
view,
the
plain
language
of
section
2253,
particularly
when
compared
with
the
plain
language
of
2244(b)(3)(e),
leaves
no
doubt
that
congress
expressly
intended
this
court
to
retain
the
certiorari
power
it
has
been
exercising
for
the
past
half
century.
in
2253,
congress
prohibited
only
one
thing
from
entering
the
court
of
appeals
absent
a
certificate,
and
that
is
an
appeal
to
the
court
of
appeals
from
the
final
order
in
a
proceeding
under
sections
2255
or
section
2254.
it
does
not
say
anything
about
this
court's
certiorari
power
and
that
silence
is
very
significant
when
you
consider
that
that
provision
was
amended
at
the
same
time
that
congress
adopted
section
2244(b)(3)(e),
in
which
it
expressly
proscribed
this
court
from
exercising
its
certiorari
jurisdiction
over
an
analogous
gate
keeping
provision
in
the
successive
petition
context,
and
i
suggest
that
congress
had
a
very
good
reason
for
doing
that.
it
would
have
been
much
more
concerned
about
the
accuracy
of
the
gate
keeping
decision
in
the
first
habeas
petition
context
than
it
would
have
been
in
the
successive
petition
context.
in
the
successive
petition
context,
it
is
guaranteed
that
a
prisoner
has
gotten
a
full
right
of
review
through
the
federal
courts.
in
this
context,
with
mr.
hohn,
for
example,
no
court
has
yet
actually
reviewed
the
merits
of
his
claim.
he
was
kicked
out
on
an
invalid
waiver
doctrine
in
the
district
court,
and
he
was
kicked
out
on
an
invalid
ruling
on
the
meaning
of
section
2253,
as
the
government
has
conceded
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
is
a
federal
prisoner
who
has
never
had
any
hearing
on
his
collateral
claim.
if
the
court
concludes
that
it
lacks
statutory
certiorari
power
it
has
residual
authority
in
the
all
writs
act
to
issue
a
common
law
writ
of
certiorari,
as
the
court
held
in
house
v.
mayo.
ms.
eileen
penner
they
do,
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
penner
by
hypothesis
here,
yes.
ms.
eileen
penner
it
is
an
aid
of
the
appellate
jurisdiction
that
this
court
could
exercise
over
the
appeal
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
pretermitted
by
denying
the
certificate
of
appealability.
this
court
has
often
held
that
it
has
the
power,
even
when
there
is
yet
no
case
in
the
court
of
appeals,
to
order
a
lower
court
to
allow
a
case
to
proceed,
for
example,
by
ordering
a
lower
court
to
issue
a
bench
warrant
or
to
decide
the
merits,
or
even
to
allow
the
record
to
be
transferred
to
the
circuit
court
of
appeals.
each
of
those
things,
if
they
were
not
corrected
by
this
court,
would
end
the
case,
which
would
otherwise
develop
into
one
over
which
this
court
would
have
statutory
certiorari
power.
in
this
case,
for
example,
if
the
court
were
to
reverse
through
its
use
of
common
law
certiorari
power
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
no
certificate
should
be
issued,
the
case
would
proceed,
a
decision
would
be
made
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
that
case
would
be
reviewable
by
this
court
on
statutory
certiorari.
were
the
court
not
to
have
that
power,
it
would
basically
be
giving
the
lower
courts
the
power
to
eliminate
its
own
jurisdiction,
which
cannot
be
the
case.
ms.
eileen
penner
when
the
court
was
interpreting
the
all
writs
act
in...
i'm
sorry,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
you
speaking
of
section
2253?
ms.
eileen
penner
in
my
view,
it's
a
question
of
comparing
the
statutory
intent
in
1254,
1651,
and
2253.
1254
and
1651
are
extremely
broad
jurisdictional
grounds
of
power
which
i
believe
cannot
easily
be
read
to
restrict
this
court's
power
in
a
way
that
it
could
not
reach
a
particular
judicial
proceeding
in
the
courts
of
appeals
like
this
one.
the
second
question
is
whether
2253
indicates
any
intent
to
take
that
power
away,
and
i
don't
see,
in
2253,
any
suggestion
in
the
plain
language,
or
even
in
the
purpose,
to
take
it
away.
the
purpose
of
2253
is
to
ensure
that
meritorious
appeals
proceed
and
that
frivolous
ones
do
not.
that
purpose
of
congress
cannot
be
accomplished
if
the
courts
of
appeals
are
applying
that
standard
erroneously.
the
power
of
this
court
on
certiorari
merely
will
permit
the
court
to
ensure
that
congress'
intent
about
what
appeals
should
be
permitted
through
the
gate
are...
that
those
decisions
that
the
courts
of
appeals
made
are
correct,
and--
ms.
eileen
penner
--in
many
cases,
it
will
accomplish
the
same
purpose
for
the
question
of
individual
justice
for
a
single
petitioner.
for
example,
mr.
hohn
would,
indeed,
be
satisfied
with
issuance
of
a
certificate
by
this
court,
but
the
question
under
the
all
writs
act
is
whether
the
issuance
of
a
common
law
writ
is
necessary
or
appropriate
in
aid
of
the
court's
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
i
submit
that
that
is
not
just
the
appellate
jurisdiction
that
the
court
exercises
in
a
single
case,
but
a
broader
institutional
interest
in
its
ability
to
perform
its
appellate
functions.
here--
ms.
eileen
penner
--here--
ms.
eileen
penner
--i
believe
that
its
purpose
is
to
permit
both.
here,
it
is
in
aid
of
the
court's
appellate
jurisdiction
in
that
it
preserves
a
case
that
ultimately
will
come
before
the
court
on
statutory
certiorari,
as
i
mentioned
earlier.
ms.
eileen
penner
in
addition,
it
is
appropriate
and--
ms.
eileen
penner
--by
a...
that's
correct.
ms.
eileen
penner
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
application
is
an
ineffectual
and
cumbersome
tool
for
the
court
to
accomplish
its
appellate
functions
of
ensuring
uniformity
among
the
circuit
courts.
ms.
eileen
penner
had
congress
indicated
an
intention
to
prevent
this
court
from
exercising
its
common
law
certiorari
power,
a
slightly
different
question
might
be
presented,
but
here
there
simply
is
no
indication
of
that
in
section
2253.
it
was
completely
silent
on
the
subject
and
in
comparison
with
section
2244,
in
which
it
barred
certiorari
review,
it's
fairly
clear
that
congress
intended
for
this
court
to
continue
to
police
the
decisions
of
the
lower
court
about
what
appeals
could
be
taken
in
a
habeas
case.
ms.
eileen
penner
i
guess
one
question
is,
if
i...
if
congress
intended
to
eliminate
the
court's
certiorari
power
it
seems
unclear
why
it
would
have
intended
the
court
to
perform
what
is
essentially
the
same
function
as
that
which
it
performs
on
certiorari
through
use
of
the
application
process.
i...
the
court
would
be
rendering
binding
decisions
on
the
meaning
of
constitutional
rights
that
were
resolving
circuit
conflicts
in
highly
developed
opinions
before
the
full
court
through
the
application
process,
which
is
highly
unusual.
i
think
the
court's
practice
strongly
suggests
that
that
is
not
its
preferred
method
of
practice
in
the
application--
ms.
eileen
penner
--the
all
writs
act
speaks
of
the...
a
power
being...
existing
when
it
is
either
necessary
or
appropriate.
in
this
court's
decision
in
alkali,
it
confirmed
that
that
power
is
available
not
merely
to
curb
excesses
of
jurisdiction
by
the
lower
courts,
but
also
to
force
lower
courts
to
exercise
their
jurisdiction
when
it
is
appropriate
to
do
so.
this
is
a
case
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
exercise
its
appellate
jurisdiction
through
use
of
the
all
writs
act.
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
court
could
conceivably
stretch
the
application
process
broad
enough
to
make
it
so
like
the
certiorari
process
that
it
can
perform
certiorari
functions
through
the
application
process,
but
it
is
unclear
why
congress
would
have
intended
that.
it
also
is
extremely
awkward,
because
it
relegates
to
a
single
justice...
typically
when
an
applicant
submits
their
application
for
a
certificate
to
a
single
justice,
it
relegates
to
that
justice
the
responsibility
for
determining
whether
the
issue
raises
matters
of
national
importance
or
a
circuit
conflict
that
warrant
the
full
court's
attention.
and
in
contrast,
in
the
certiorari
process,
all
members
of
the
court
have
the
opportunity
to
consider
that
question
of
whether
it
is
worthy
of
the
full
court's
attention.
ms.
eileen
penner
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
eileen
penner
surely
the
burden
on
a
single
justice
to
consider
those
issues
of
whether
a
question
of
national
importance
is
raised
or
whether
there
is
a
circuit
conflict
will
be
significantly
less
if
the
court
clearly
establishes
that
the
petition
for
certiorari
remains
an
available
route.
and,
in
fact,
this
court
has
exercised
its
power
to
use
certiorari
repeatedly
over
the
last
50
years,
sometimes
to
resolve
circuit
conflicts,
often
to
define
the
scope
of
constitutional
rights,
and
to
make
very
important
statements
about
the
availability
of
habeas
relief,
as
an
individual
circuit
justice
acting
in
chambers
would
not
have
the
responsibility
for
ferreting
out
those
questions
if
the
petition
for
certiorari
remained
available
and
instead
could
focus
on
the
questions
of
individual
justice
that
an
application
raised.
which
actually
goes
to
another
issue,
which
is
that
typically
an
applicant
for
a
certificate
will
be
presenting
to
the
court
only
issues
of
their
own
individual
entitlement
and
will
not
be
highlighting
for
the
court
circuit
conflicts
and
the
importance
of
the
issues
they're
presenting.
ms.
eileen
penner
i
understand
your
honor
to
be...
are
you
questioning
about
the
standard
that
the
courts
of
appeals
should
be
applying?
ms.
eileen
penner
the
government
has
argued
that
a
higher
standard
should
apply,
that
this
court
should
only
issue
certificates
in
the
most
extraordinary
circumstances.
they
made
that
argument
on
the
assumption
that
certiorari
review
would
be
available.
i...
that
argument,
that
the
court
should
apply
a
different
standard
in
deciding
whether
to
grant
applications
for
certificates,
contravenes
the
plain
language
of
section
2253
and
this
court's
own
decisions.
section
2253
expressly
sets
out
a
standard.
it
is
a
substantial
showing
of
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
and
that
standard
applies
equally
both
to
circuit
justices
and
to
circuit
judges.
had
congress
intended
for
the
court
to
apply
a
different
standard,
i
expect
that
it
would
have
said
so.
in
addition,
the
court
in
barefoot
v.
estelle
set
out
the
standard
which
congress
subsequently
codified,
and
it
never
indicated
that,
were
a
certificate
application
to
be
submitted
to
it,
it
would
apply
a
different
standard
and,
indeed,
circuit
justices
in
chambers
appear
to
have
been
applying
precisely
that
standard.
we
do
not
argue
that
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
the
court
to
require
a
petitioner
to
seek
relief
elsewhere
before
submitting
an
application
for
a
certificate
to
this
court.
it
is
a
rule
that
the
court
has
used
in
other
circumstances,
and
it
furthers
the
court's
appellate
function
by
permitting
it
to
review
the
decisions
of
lower
courts
rather
than
to
be
deciding
questions
in
the
first
instance.
but
that
is
different...
requiring
applicants
for
a
certificate
to
exhaust
other
remedies
first
is
a
different
matter
than
raising
the
bar
and
saying
that
they
must
prove
not
merely
a
substantial
showing
of
a
denial
of
a
constitutional
right,
but
also
a
clear
and
indisputable
substantial
showing.
one
other
point
is
that...
justice
scalia
raised
the
question
of
the
burden
on
justices
in
chambers.
the
availability
of
petition
for
certiorari
will
ease
the
burden
on
justices
in
chambers
of
deciding
applications
for
certificates,
because
the
court
will
have
the
power
to
slice
through
to
the
single
error,
the
legal
error
that
a
lower
court
got
wrong,
in
this
case
the
question
whether
mr.
hohn's
claim
was
the
denial
of
a
constitutional
or
a
statutory
right.
a
justice
in
chambers
or,
in
fact,
even
the
full
court,
were
the
justice
to
refer
the
matter
to
the
full
court,
would
not
have
that
power
and,
instead,
would
have
to
consider
all
of
the
secondary
issues,
for
example,
those
that
were
raised
in
our
separate
application
in
this
case,
and
question
whether
a
petitioner
has
made
a
showing
of
cause
and
prejudice
for
their
procedural
default,
actual
in
the
sense
this
is
a
burden
that
the
justices
in
chambers
will
not
have
to
bear
if
it
holds
to
its
50-year
practice
of
finding
that...
of
issuing
writs
of
certiorari
to
review
the
decisions
of
lower
courts
on
certificates.
ms.
eileen
penner
it's
true
that
the
court
could
combine
those
two
issues,
but
only
if
it
affirms
that
is
retains
the
certiorari
power.
were
the
court
to
hold
that
it
lacks
the
certiorari
power,
the
full
court
could
decide
one
legal
issue
and
then
refer
the
rest
of
the
case
back
to
a
single
justice
to
decide
the
rest
of
the
issues,
predicate
to
determining
whether
a
certificate
should
be
granted.
if
the
court
will
permit,
and
no
further
questions
are
pending,
i'd
like
to
save
time
for
rebuttal.
ms.
eileen
penner
justice
ginsburg
raised
an
issue
which
is
precisely
the
sort
of
issue
that
this
court
could
not
reach
but
for
its
certiorari
power
and
that
is
the
question
whether,
after
in
re
burwell,
a
single
dissenting
judge
on
a
court
of
appeals
panel,
his
vote
in
favor
of
a
certificate
is
sufficient
to
mandate
that
a
certificate
be
issued.
that
is
the
sort
of
question,
the
procedural
question
about
issuance
of
a
certificate,
that
this
court
would
have
no
opportunity
to
review.
ms.
eileen
penner
the
question
is
whether
congress
did.
i
cannot
imagine
all
of
the
situations
in
which
an
important
procedural
issue
might
arise
that
this
court
would
need
to
resolve,
but
there
may
be
questions
that
go
to
the
heart
of
section
2253
that
congress
would
want
this
court
to
have
the
authority
to
resolve.
there
was
a
point
about...
i...
about
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
that
house
was
decided,
and
i...
we
have
stated
our
position
in
the
letter
that
we
submitted,
but
i
just
want
to
clarify
that
the
question...
the
question
that
mr.
sutton
has
raised
and
the
question
about
the
legislative
history
is
whether
the
1925
act
retracted
the
power
that
the
1908
act
had
conferred
on
circuit
justices
to
grant
certificates
of
probable
cause.
the
language
of
section
13
strongly
suggests
that
the
only
part
of
the
1908
act
that
was
retracted
was
the
part
that
required
direct
appeal
to
the
supreme
court
and
that
justices
retained
their
power
to
grant
certificates.
ms.
eileen
penner
we
don't...
i
personally
cannot
say
that
there
is
a
dearth,
because
there...
it's
extremely
difficult
to
search
this
court's
records
from
that
period
in
applications
that
would
have
been
decided
in
chambers,
so
i
don't
think--
ms.
eileen
penner
--i
think
that...
i
am
uncertain
that
mr.
sutton
would
be
able
to
make
a
declaration
that
there
were
no
applications.
he
can
only
say
that
westlaw
does
not
report
any.
many
of
these
are
simply
not
published
and
they're
not
available,
and
i
think
i
can
make
a
recommendation...
representation
that
i've
asked
the
clerk
of
the
court
about...
or
the
librarian
about
how
to
get
this,
and
it's
very
difficult
to
find,
so
we
don't
know
whether
they
occurred
or
didn't
occur
during
that
period.
it's
certainly
true
that
house
didn't
mention
it,
but
house
also
did
not
mention
another
form
of
relief
that
was
available,
and
that
was
an
original
petition
for
habeas
corpus
to
this
court,
which
house
had
indeed
sought.
the
existence
of
that
remedy
did
not
deter
the
court
in
holding
that
it
had
common
law
certiorari
power.
in
addition,
the
question
about
whether
the
1911
act's
definition
of
circuit
judge
applies,
the
fact
is
that
the
1925
act
did
not
even
use
the
language,
circuit
judge,
so
the
definition
of
circuit
judge
is
sort
of
irrelevant.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
1925
act
eliminated
the
power
of
the
circuit
justices
that
the
1908
act
had
created.
ms.
eileen
penner
i'm
sorry,
could
you--
ms.
eileen
penner
--yes.
ms.
eileen
penner
it
may
have
the
same
implication.
