mr.
john
t.
montgomery
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
this
case
presents
the
question
left
open
in
prior
cases
concerning
the
extent
to
which
the
fifth
amendment
places
any
restriction
on
the
power
of
congress
to
impose
retroactive
liability
on
private
parties
to
fund
social
programs.
the
coal
act
of
1992
is
an
unprecedented
statute
as
applied
to
eastern
enterprises
and
it
is
contrary
to
the
constitutional
traditions
embodied
in
the
fifth
amendment
for
two
distinct
reasons.
first,
the
coal
act
violates
the
due
process
clause
because
it
changes
the
legal
consequences
of
past
employment
relationships
that
concluded
long
ago
at
a
time
when
eastern
could
not
have
anticipated
any
future
obligation
to
former
employees.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
your
honor,
we
have
attempted
to
the
best
we
can
not
to
put
a
label,
but
if
a
label
is
necessary.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
your
honor,
if
a
label
must
be
placed
it
would
have
to
be
substantive
due
process
but
as
we
have
pointed
out
in
our
briefs,
the
values
that
we
seek
to
protect
here
are
largely
procedural
values.
the
interest
in
notice,
in
understanding
the
consequences
of
one's
actions.
it
is
procedural
in
that
sense,
i
suppose
in
the
way
that
the
void
for
vagueness
doctrine
is
procedural.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
certainly
the
court
has
restricted
procedural
due
process
to
the
legislative
process
in
the
past
and
we
don't
mean
to
suggest
that
in
order
to
prevail
in
this
case
the
court
needs
to
create
a
new
doctrine.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
it
certainly
has
not
been
in
good
favor
for
some
decades,
justice
scalia.
the
court,
however,
has
been
very
careful
in
its
decisions
not
to
suggest
that
there
were
not
limits
to
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
retroactive
legislation,
and
we
are
here
to
say
that
this
is
the
case
which
crosses
that
border.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
we
transferred--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--we
are
certainly
not
in
the
same
shoes
of
those
amici
who
have
been
driven
into
bankruptcy,
but
in
terms
of
the
analytical
application
of
the
statute
to
eastern,
liability
has
been
imposed
on
eastern
solely
because
it
was
an
employer
of
miner's
before
1946.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
section
9706(f),
justice
o'connor,
preserves
to
eastern
any
right
that
it
may
have
had
to
seek
recovery
from
its
subsidiary
or
the
party
to
whom
it
sold
the
subsidiary,
peabody
coal.
the
statute
does
not
create
any
new
right
of
action.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
in
the
action,
in
the
third
party
action
that
we
filed
below,
we
alleged
that
we
do
have
a
right.
i
will
tell
the
court
that
if
to
the
extent
that
we
have
a
right
is
a
right
in
implied
indemnity.
there
were
no
documents
that
passed
between
eastern
and
its
subsidiary
or
between
eastern
and
peabody
holding
company
which
specifically
spoke
to
the
possibility
of
future
statutory
liability,
and
in
the
event
that
we
are
unsuccessful
here,
we
will
be
left
with
that
third
party
action
in
the
district
of
massachusetts
in
which
we
will
attempt
to
advance
our
right
to
obtain
recovery
on
an
indemnification
or
contribution
ground.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
justice
kennedy,
the
record
tells
us
that
as
of
the
time
that
we
filed
this
lawsuit
that
1,400
employees,
former
employees
or
their
spouses
had
been
assigned
to
eastern.
since
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
we
have
had
additional
assignments,
but
those
are
not
part
of
the
record.
with
respect
to
the
amount
of
the
liability,
it
is
an
annual
premium
that's
established
by
the
combined
fund.
the
record
is
undisputed
that
at
the
time
that
the
lawsuit
was
filed,
and
mr.
harper's
affidavit
is
in
the
record
to
this
effect,
that
the
actuarial
calculation
of
the
liability
was
in
the
vicinity
of
$100
million.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
certainly,
justice
ginsburg,
and
we
are
not
attaching
any
special
significance
to
the
amount
of
money.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
the
test
that
we
have
suggested
here,
and
that
we
think
is
reflected
in
the
court's
precedence
such
as
concrete
pipe
and
turner
elkhorn
is
whether
a
party
upon
whom
congress
seeks
to
impose
a
retroactive
liability
has
some
reasonable
basis
to
anticipate.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
there
is
a
class
of
companies
that
are
included
within
the
coal
act
that
we
believe
properly
bear
that
responsibility.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
we
are
not
seeking
at
this
point
to
shift
our
liability
to
any
particular
company.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
that's
right.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
if
we
are
successful
here
the
miners
and
their
spouses
assigned
to
eastern
will
then
be
reassigned
under
the
priority
scheme
set
forth
in
the
statute
to
other
companies
for
whom
those
miners
worked
or
in
the
absence
of
such
a
company
will
be
assigned
to
what's
called
the
orphan
pool.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
certainly.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
i
don't
wish
to
be
categorical
as
to
every
single
company.
there
are
certainly
other
companies
that
may
have
as
applied
complaints
to
present
with
respect
to
the
application
to
them.
but
as
to
whether
obligations
can
be
opposed
retroactively
on
those
who
participated
in
a
multiemployer
plan,
at
least
beginning
in
1978,
which
undertook
to
provide
defined
benefits--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--some
of
them
may
be,
your
honor,
but
those--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--well,
certainly--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--they
undertook...
they
undertook
an
obligation
that
was
at
least
as
extensive
as
this
obligation.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
i
agree
with
that.
there
are
various
classes
that
are
included
in
the
statute.
and
i
don't
want
to
confuse
the
court.
certainly
with
respect
to
the
class
of
so
called
1988
signatories,
those
who
signed
the
last
collective
bargaining
agreement
at
a
time
when
deficits
began
to
develop
in
this
plan
because
they
lowered
the
rate
of
contribution
to
fund
the
benefits,
including
the
benefits
to
these
employees,
and
when
that
plan
started
to
develop
those
deficits,
we
do
submit
that
it
would
have
been
perfectly
within
congress'
authority
to
say
that
all
of
those
companies
should
have
understood
that
when
they
made
changes
in
the
plans
that
took
the
plans
into
a
deficit
position,
they
should
have
understood
once
the
initial
legislative
interest
was
expressed
in
this
subject
in
1989
by
senator
rockefeller
shortly
after
the
execution
of
that
agreement,
that
there
was
some
reasonable
possibility
that
congress
may
step
in
and
rescue
the
plans.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
i
would
suggest
that
there
is
a
difference
of
more
than
a
degree,
justice
souter,
in
anticipating
congressional
action
within
a
year
or
two
after
a
particular
development
in
the
history
of
the
plan,
another
over
a
generation.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
that's
certainly
the
case,
and
our
liability--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--that's
exactly
right
and
prior
to
1965
as
to
the
contracts
that
we
signed,
those
were
defined
benefit...
excuse
me,
defined
contribution
contracts.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
limited
to
the
contribution
without
any
agreement
as
to
defined
benefits.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
justice
scalia,
the
congress
only
made
one
finding,
and
that
finding
is
in
the
preamble
to
the
statute,
and
that
finding
simply
says
that
those,
that
the
congress
seeks
to
attach
liabilities
to
those
most
responsible
for
planned
liabilities,
period.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
did
not
itself
adopt.
that's
exactly
correct.
the
expectations,
argument
certainly
is
prominent
in
the
judicial
decisions
that
have
upheld
the
coal
act.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
not
at
all
because
it
would
not
have
been
reasonable
on
the
expectations
argument,
justice
breyer,
for
miners
or
their
spouses
to
develop
any
expectation
at
all
as
a
result
of
eastern's
conduct.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
perhaps
i
misunderstood
your
question.
if
your
question
is,
is
it
unconstitutional
to
the
extent
that
congress
noted
that
we
were
in
the
business
until
1987--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--our
position
here
would
be
far
weaker
if
we
had
never--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--i
think
it
is
not
unless
this
court
is
willing.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
justice
breyer
i
want...
meaning
to
be
clear,
i
think
this
court
would
have
to
extend
concrete
pipe
in
order
for
liability
to
attach
to
companies
that
were
in
business
up
until
1987
or
1988--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--this
court
could
do
that,
and
i
think
it
is
only
a
modest
extension,
but
i
do
not
believe
that
it
is
constitutional
absent
that,
that
determination
by
this
court.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
absolutely.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
congress
considered
the
extent
to
which
it
ought
to
pierce
the
corporate
veil,
and
it
did
not.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
our
expectation
clearly
was
reasonable,
we
believe--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--because
we
had
a
well
capitalized
subsidiary
that
made
all
of
the
contributions
that
were
asked
of
it
and
remained
in
business.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
in
this
particular
statute,
congress
also
pierced
the
veil
and
set
up
a
category
of
responsible
parties
called
related
persons.
eastern,
under
that
veil
piercing
mechanism,
is
not
a
related
person,
and
we
think
in
that
regard,
congress
got
it
right
as
to
eastern.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
it
has
not
been
frustrated,
that's
absolutely
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
it
is
not.
liability
is
exclusively
based
on
the
fact
that
we
were
directly
an
employer
between
1946
and
1965.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
not
at
all,
your
honor.
we
have--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--i
do
indeed.
we
do
have
a
takings
claim,
and
i
would
like
to
address
it.
our
takings
claim
rests
on
two
premises,
that
the
takings
clause
is
designed
to
avoid
the
injustice
of
forcing
someone
to
bear
public
burdens
that
ought
to
be
borne
by
the
public
themselves
or
by
someone
else.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
hodel
v.
irving
with
respect
to
the
escheat
of
title
rights
on
indian
lands.
united
states
v.
security
industrial
bank
and
going
back
further,
though
it's
not
cited
in
our
brief,
a
case
and
an
opinion
by
justice
brandeis,
thompson
v.
consolidated
gas.
in
each
of
those
cases,
the
government
effected
a
transfer
of
property
from
one
private
person
to
another
private
person.
that's
exactly
what
the
government
has
done
here.
but
in
doing
so,
the
statute
undermines
values
which
are
held
dear
in
the
course
of
this
court's
takings
jurisprudence,
and
that
is
value
that
says
that
we
ought
not
to
have
individuals
singled
out
to
bear
public
burdens,
to
bear
more
than
their
fair
share.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
it
is
our
burden,
and
i'm
going
to
have
to
slide
back
over
to
the
due
process
side
to
some
extent
to
answer
that
question.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
it
does.
the
expectations
finding,
if
it
was
made
by
the
commission,
first
of
all,
is
not
one
that
was--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--no.
it
was
the
coal
commission.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
appointed
by
the
department
of
labor
though
as
a
technical
matter
its
report
was
never
adopted
so
far
as
where
we
are...
by
the
secretary
of
labor
after
it
was
submitted,
but
that
report
does
not
speak
specifically
to
the
class
of
companies
of
which
we
are
a
part,
the
so
called
super
reach
back
companies
who
were
in
the
business
directly
only
up
until
1978.
but
even
to
the
extent
that
there
is
a
finding
that
was
made
with,
that
we
created
expectations,
the
expectations
argument
is
if
i
might
be
charitable
and
a
little
loose
with
my
language,
is
a
fig
leaf.
it's
a
fig
leaf
for
essentially
unlimited
liability
that
might
be
opposed
retroactively
on
companies
that
have
been
in
business.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
i
would
suggest,
justice
souter,
that
the
court
is
entitled
to
and
ought
to
look
at
the
facts
that
underlies
that
so
called
expectation
finding.
and
those
facts
are
simply
that
a
party
entered
into
a
limited
contract.
a
contract
which
at
the
time
in
an
exchange
with
the
union
was
sought,
thought
to
be
a
social
advance,
and
then
by
virtue
of
that
participation
to
the
limits
of
that
agreement,
it
is
now
suggested
that
an
expectation
was
created--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--the
government
says
so
but
there
certainly
is
no
finding
to
that
effect
and
that
doesn't
make
it
so,
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
ought
to
consider
how
private
contracting,
i.e.,
the
employment
area
or
any
other
area,
is
going
to
work,
if
on
the
one
hand
we
are
entitled
as
a
matter
of
freedom
of
contract
to
participate
in
bargains
and
to
participate
to
a
limited
extent,
but
at
the
same
time,
the
government
may
come
along
a
year
later
or
a
generation
later
or
more
and
say
by
virtue
of
your
mere
participation,
you
have
set
up
an
expectation,
and
that
expectation
provides
us
with
a
basis,
an
unlimited
basis.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
well,
there
is
no
finding
with
respect
to
such
a
consensus.
if
there
was
a
consensus,
it
was
a
consensus
to
participate
under
the
terms
of
the
taft
hartley
act
in
a
multi
employer
plan.
one
of
the
premises--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--that
statement
needs
to
be
looked
at
in
context.
what
the
trustee
was
doing
is
complaining
about
the
management
by
the
trustees
of
the
assets
that
had
been
tendered
to
them
under
the
terms
of
the
agreement.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
a
promise
of
lifetime
benefits
which
he
suggests
in
his
statement
that
the
industry
couldn't
possibly
fulfill.
that
was
his
point.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
absolutely
not.
in
this
court's
decision,
in
amex
coal,
i
think
you
made
it
clear
that
under
the
taft
hartley
act
independent
trustees
are
not
representatives
of
the
company
and
are
not
entitled.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
and
my
response
is
largely
the
same,
and
that
is
if
the
statement
is
looked
at
in
context,
i
think
you
will
see
that
it
was
not
made
on
behalf
of
the
companies
and
it
does
not
support
the
weight
that
the
government
has
attempted
to
put
on
it.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
the
difference
is
causation.
the
difference
is
that
the
premise
of
the
environmental
statute
that
you
have
mentioned
is
that
the
liable
party
caused
that
injury
to
the
environment.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
could
have
had
a
very
small
part
of
it
but
causation
as
a
principled
matter
is
fundamental
to
the
operation
of
that--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--no.
because
i
would
say
that
an
expectation
is
not
a
sufficiently,
sufficient
basis
to
justify
retroactive
legislation.
because
expect--
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
--well,
the
court
in
turner
elkhorn
distinguished
between
specific
medical
needs
and
generalized
medical
needs.
we
did
not
cause
the
needs
of
these
miners
or
their
spouses
for
medical
care.
mr.
john
t.
montgomery
congress
has
broad
latitude
to
impose
obligations
on
existing
members
of
an
industry
to
bear
liability
for
workers
who
are
currently
in
the
business
or
formerly
in
the
business.
it's
in
the
nature
of
the
an
excise.
congress
i
think
has
virtually
unlimited
power
to
do
so,
justice
ginsburg.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
