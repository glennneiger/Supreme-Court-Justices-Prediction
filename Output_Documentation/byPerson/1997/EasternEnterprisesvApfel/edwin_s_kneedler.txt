mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
coal
industry
retirement,
retiree
benefits
act
of
1992
rests
on
two
basic
determinations
made
by
congress
in
that
year.
excuse
me.
first,
congress
determined
that
the
cost
of
furnishing
health
benefits
to
retirees
and
their
families
which
benefits
were
at
risk
in
1992
should
be
borne
by
participants
in
the
industry
rather
than
by
the
public
at
large.
and
the
second
critical
determination
was
that
within
that
industry,
the
costs
should
be
borne
to
the
extent
possible
by
those
companies
that
had
actually
employed
the
miners.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
determination
by
congress
at
the
time,
there
were
two
reasons.
one
is
the
congress...
the
act
rests
on
a
determination
or
judgment
that
the
miners
had
legitimate
expectations
that
these
funds
would
pay
lifetime
benefits
and
they
had
paid
lifetime
benefits
to
retirees
since
1950.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
the
due
process
clause
is
not
limited...
congress'
ability
under
the
due
process
clause
is
not
limited
to
enforcing
existing
contractual
relationships
and
as
this
court's
decisions
in
concrete
pipe
and
connolly
have
shown.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
is
no
legal
guarantee,
but
the
expectation...
there
was,
there
were
guarantees
during
the
period
of
the
respective
contracts
but
each
of
the,
each
of
the
contracts
was
a
contract
for
term,
for
a
term,
and
it's
important
to
recognize--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--1974
was
the
first
time
that
the
agreement
itself
contained
those...
contained
those
limitations
but
with
respect...
excuse
me,
that
guarantee
but
with
respect
to
the
retirees--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
all
it
could
be.
they
said
lifetime,
lifetime
benefits,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
contract
had
a
term.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
spouses
and
dependents
of
retirees,
those
benefits
were
afforded
from
the
beginning.
for
widows'
benefits,
there
were
widows
benefits
from
1950
to
'54
for
life
and
then
that
dropped
down
to
a
year,
two
years.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
1974
the
widows'
benefits
were
again
made
part
of
the
contract.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
1974
again
was
the
first
time
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
correct.
and
this
is
something
that
a
number
of
the
courts
have
pointed
to.
since
1950
lifetime
benefits
were
paid,
health
benefits
were
paid
to
retirees
and
their
families
and
under,
under
a
series
of
collective
bargaining--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
contracts,
the
contracts
were
renewed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
got
renewed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
at
all.
these
were
benefits
under,
under
an
industry
wide
multiemployer
plan
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
petitioner
overlooks.
the
benefits
under
this
plan,
the
miners
all
along
continued
to
keep
those
benefits
even
if
the
company
they
worked
for
went
out
of
business
because
this
was
a
collective
undertaking
by
all
employers
in
the
industry
to
furnish
benefits
for
all
employees
when
they
retired
and
their
spouses
and
their
widows.
this
furnished,
this
furnished--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
there
were
widows'
benefits
the
duration
of
the
benefits.
there
were
lifetime
widows'
benefits
from
1950
to
1954
and
that
dropped
back
then
to
one
year
in
1954
but
there
were
provisions
even
then
for
widows'
benefits
of
some
provision.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for
some
duration.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
correct.
and
in
fact
the
plans
were
funded
and
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
especially
a
multiemployer
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
is
industrywide
is
more
than
just
a
contract.
it
is,
it
is
the
document
that
establishes
the
relationship
long
term.
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
relationship
that
extends
from
contract
period
to
contract
period.
and
employees
come
to
expect
and
particularly
in
this
industry
came
to
expect
as
evidenced
by
the
strikes
that
occurred
every
time
there
was
some
threat
to
the
continuation
of
those
benefits,
they
came
to
expect
that
those
benefits
would
continue
over
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
were,
they
were,
they
were
in
the
forms
but
again
justice
o'connor,
the
question,
this
is
not
a
contract
enforcement
question.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
rational
for
congress
to
look
to
the
relationship
that
grew
up
under
a
series
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--quite
the
contrary,
justice
scalia.
i
think
the
course
of
conduct
in
this
industry
from,
from
the
seizure
of
the
coal
mines
in
1946
to
the
current
time
was
that
the
coal
companies
would
take
care
of
these
miners.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
but
the
expectations
involved
are
not
just
what
comes
from
the
employers'
intentions
but
what
expectations
were
reasonably
accrued
by
virtue
of
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
that
the
employers
entered
into.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
and
over
the
course
of
the
relationship
in
fact
they
were
renewed.
under
the
plan,
for
example,
another
very
tangible
symbol
of
the
permanence
of
these
benefits
was
the
plan
constructed
hospitals
in
critical
communities
in
appalachia
to
furnish
health
benefits.
these
were
financed
by
20-year
loans
from
the
fund
in
the
'50s
to
establish
a
permanent
system
of
health--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--two
answers
to
that,
if
i
may.
the
first
is
if
we
are
looking,
if
we
are
looking
at
expectations,
i
think
it's
proper
to
look
both
at
the
expectations,
look
at
the
expectations
of
both
parties
to
the
contractual
relationship
and
an
important
part
of
that
expectation
here
is
that
this
was...
this...
the
employer
didn't
just
hire
somebody
during
the
term
of
the
contract.
the
employee
during
that
term
of
the
contract
accrued
service
credits
that
enabled
the
person
upon
retirement
to
get
the
very
benefits
we
are
talking
about
here.
for
example,
and
this
is
highly
instructive,
sam
east,
who
is
the
miner
whose
assignment
to
eastern
triggered
this
lawsuit
worked
for
eastern
from
1934
to
1960.
26
years
of
his
working
life
were
with
eastern.
the
only
reason
that
he
and
then
now
his
widow
is
eligible
for
benefits
under
this
plan
is
because
he
worked
for
eastern.
he
accrued
the
20
years
of
eligibility
of
service
credits
during
his
time
with
eastern.
eastern
was
present
at
the
creation
of
this
collective
bargaining
relationship
as
a
member
of
bcoa
in
1950
and
the
problems
that
we
see
today
are
the
product
of
the
way
in
which
that
collective
bargaining
relationship
was
structured
in
1950.
with
respect
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
would
be
a
sufficient
basis
on
which
congress
may
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
they
entered
into
contracts
for
a
term
but
what
congress
did--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--what
congress
could
look
at
legitimately
was
the
course
of
conduct
over
the
history
of
this
industry
in
which
health
benefits
and
retiree
health
benefits
were
a
critical
factor.
and
congress
could
also
look
at
the
fact
that
every
time
there
was
an
effort
to
take
these
back,
most
recently
in
1989
in
the
pittston
strike,
there
were
severe
disruptions
to
the
national
economy.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
i'm
not
saying
it's
controlling
but
there
is
a
combination
of
expectations
and
if
i
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
i
may,
the
other
party
did
not
say
no.
the
other
party...
the
employers
never
said
five
years
and
then
we
are
not
funding
a
benefits
plan.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
what
they
did
is,
what's
significant
is
that
every
time
there
was
a
contract
renewal,
the
contract
was
renewed,
the
contributions
paying
into
the...
as
you
pointed
out,
the
plan
is
ongoing.
the
contributions
were
paid
into
the
plan
at
every
contract
renewal.
that
course
of
conduct,
and
congress
can
legitimately
look
at
the
course
of
conduct
in
this
unique
industry
over
a
course
of
time
to
see
what
sort
of
expectations
had
legitimately
grown
up.
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
this
is
very
different
because
this
act
only
addresses
health
benefits
prospectively
from
the
date
of
the
act.
this
act
does
not
reach
back
and
require
people
like
petitioner
to
pay
for
health
benefits
in
the
preceding
years.
the
$300
million
deficit
that
was
projected
in
these
funds
by
1993
was
made
up
entirely
by
the
companies
that
were
parties
to
the
1988
collective
bargaining
agreement.
this
was
another
agreement
that
was
due
to
expire
in
1993.
when
congress
looked
at
this
arrangement
if
there
had
been
no
new
collective
bargaining
agreement,
all
of
the
retirees
in
this
fund
would
have
been
out
of
luck.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
um--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
under
the
hypothetical
there
was
no...
maybe
i
misunderstood.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
but
there
was
no
legal
requirement
to
pay
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
again,
it
would
depend
on
the
rationality
of
it.
but
that
seems
to
me
to
be
vastly
different
from
this
situation.
there
was
an
existing
collective
bargaining
relationship
that
provided
accumulated
service
credits.
the
employers
obtained
the
benefits
of
mobility
and
portability
of
miners
under
this
during
time
they
were
there.
they
obtained
the
benefits
of
mechanization.
they
obtained
the
benefits
of
tradeoffs
with,
of
wages
against
mechanization
and
pension
benefits.
there
was
an
ongoing
collective
bargaining
relationship
under
which
there
were
lifetime
benefits
guaranteed,
so
during
the
course
of
the
relationship
that
was
present.
but
if
i
could
go
back
to
the
address,
justice
souter
has
mentioned
trustee
owen's
statements
but
another
significant
point
in
the
record
to
note
is
the
address
by,
by
mr.
moody
who
was
the
president
of
the
southern
coal
operator's
association,
a
member
of
bcoa
in
1953
and
this
is
discussed
at
page
48
of
the
fund's
brief.
mr.
moody
was
making
an
address
in
which
he
identified
the
problems
in
the
fund
that
were
present
at
the
creation,
the
promise
of
benefits
and
yet
pay
as
you
go
funding
which
created
an
internal
problem
with
the
fund
from
the
beginning.
and
he
said
at
that
time
it
may
well
be,
it
was
foreseeable
that
congress
at
some
point
might
have
to
intervene
to
assure
either
regulation
of
the
benefits
or
to
assure
the
payment
of
the
funds
and
that's
at
page
2,000
of
the
appendix
in
the
court
of
appeals.
the
people
in
this
industry,
the
employers,
knew
from
experience
that
the
government,
that
this
was--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but,
but
two
things
about
that.
in
turner
elkhorn,
an
employer's
liability
for
paying
black
lung
benefits
to
employees
could
have
applied
to
employment
relationships
that
ended
decades
earlier.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
but
there
is
a
causation
element
here
as
well.
again,
what
we
are
seeing
today,
what
congress
saw
in
the
early
1990s
was
the,
the
consequences
of
a,
of
a
pattern
of
conduct
and
collective
bargaining
that
began
in
the
1950s
with
a
guarantee
of
benefits
and
insufficient
funding
and
the
industry
made
up
for
that
each
time,
each
time
it
was
asked
to
contribute
to
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
the
terms
that
they
were--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
true.
again,
the
question
is
not,
this
is
not
a
contract
enforcement
action.
the
question
is
whether
congress
can
look
to
the
collective
bargaining
relationship
to
define
the
category
of
people--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--beginning
in
1974
it
was
expressed
in
the
contract.
there
is
no
indication
that
that
was
a
departure
and
in
fact--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
act
itself
doesn't
contain
the
findings
but
in
a
due
process
challenge,
the
question
is
whether
the
facts
on
which
congress
apparently
based
its
action
could
reasonably
be
believed
to
be
true.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
under
this
court's
takings
jurisprudence
there
is
a
vast
difference
between
adjusting
the
benefits
and
burdens
of
economic
conduct
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is
some
degree
of
review,
but,
but,
but
i
think
it
seems
to
me
hardly
irrational
for
congress
to
conclude
that
over
a
50-year
course
of
conduct
in
an
industry
of
lifetime
benefits
have
in
fact
been
paid
that
the
retirees
who
worked
their
entire
lives
in
the
mines
under
such
a
system
in
which
their
fathers
and
brothers--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
debates
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
this
act
show
careful
attention
by
congress
as
to
who
within
the
coal
industry
should
bear
the
burden
and
congress
concluded
that
the
burden
should
not
be
borne
by
current
coal
companies--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
terms
of
a
current
assessment,
congress
could
certainly
do
that.
a
portion
of
the
cost
of
this
is
paid--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
was
responding
to
the,
to
current
natural
gas
companies.
congress
can
impose
a
tax
on
a
current
industry
and
in
fact
a
major
portion
of
the
liability
here
is
paid,
was
paid
for
by
transfers
from
the
1950
pension
fund
and
from
the
abandoned
mine
fund
which
were
paid
for
by
fees
on
current
mining
companies.
they
pay
for
the
miners
who
can't
be
assigned
to
an
employer.
but
where
an
employee
can
be
identified
with
an
employer
who
actually
got
the
fruits
of
that
person's
labor
who
gave
him
service
credits
during
the
employment
relationship,
who
because
of
that
employment
relationship
was
part
of
a
collective
bargaining
relationship,
congress
can
look
to
that
relationship
to
define
the
category
of
people
among
whom
the
costs
should
be
spread
and
it's
carefully
tailored
here
for
pre-1978--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
is
not,
but
it
is
not
uncommon
to
have
for
generally
applicable
statute
to
take
the
company
as
it
finds
it
with
respect
to
its
economic
viability.
