mr.
peter
buscemi
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court.
i'm
here
on
behalf
of
the
trustees
of
the
combined
benefit
fund
and
the
beneficiaries
for
whom
they
are
fiduciaries.
i
think
it's
easy
in
the
midst
of
the
argument
here
to
lose
sight
of
the
human
dimension
of
this
problem.
that's
the
dimension
that
congress
focused
on
when
it
acted
in
1992.
congress
faced
an
imminent
crisis.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
in
force
at
the
time
congress
acted
had
less
than
four
months
to
run
and
at
the
end
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
the
employers
who
had
signed
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
like
eastern,
like
the
other
employers
that
have
submitted
briefs
to
the
court
could
have
made
the
very
same
argument.
they
could
have
said
that
our
obligation
to
contribute
was
for
the
term
of
this
agreement.
now,
let
me
make
sure
that
we
are
clear
on
what
the
historical
record
was.
the
historical
record
was
that
in
1946
president
truman
seized
the
mines.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
and
the
union
negotiated
collective
bargaining
agreement.
from
that
time
forward,
there
were
health
care
benefits
provided
for
miners,
spouses,
dependents
in
the
coal
industry
funded
by
contributions
by
the
employers.
that
continued
year
after
year
after
year
for
almost
50
years
by
the
time
congress
acted.
in
1974,
for
the
first
time,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
made
a
specific
reference
to
beneficiaries
retaining
a
health
services
card
until
death
or
for
life.
in
1978,
there
were
further
changes
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
now,
although
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
prescribed
specific
contribution
amounts
per
time
or
per
hour,
the
employers
were
given
the
right
to
increase
those
contribution
amounts
as
needed
to
guarantee
the
benefits
that
were
specified
in
the
contract.
so
by
the
time
congress
acted
in
1992,
we
had
been
under
a
regime
for
the
last
14
years
in
which
there
had
been
a
specific
set
of
guaranteed
benefits.
now,
mr.
montgomery's
client,
eastern,
through
its
wholly
owned
subsidiary,
eastern
associated,
signed
not
one,
not
two,
but
three
collective
bargaining
agreements
that
guaranteed
these
benefits--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--your
honor,
all
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
i
would
not
agree
with
that,
your
honor,
with
all
respect.
i
would
think
that
when
the
court
looks
at
the
reasonableness
of
what
congress
has
done
under
this
deferential
standard
of
review
that
looking
at
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
particular
petitioner
before
the
court
is
what
the
court
has
traditionally
done
and
it
is--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
with
respect,
your
honor,
i
think
that
this
court
has
said
repeatedly,
this
court
in
reviewing
the
constitutionality
of
legislation
may
take
into
account
not
only
what
the
legislative
record
may
reveal
about
what
congress
actually
thought
or
what
some
members
of
congress
actually
thought
but
also
what
they
reasonably
could
have
thought.
in
fact,
the
court
has
said
repeatedly
that
there
is
no
obligation
for
congress
to
build
a
legislative
record.
mr.
peter
buscemi
well,
your
honor,
we
think--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--yes,
mary
helen
is
a
case
that's
pending
right
now
in
the
fourth
circuit
and
the
statute
has
been
sustained
with
respect
to
mary
helen
by
the
district
court
in
that
case
and
we
think
it
should
be
sustained
with
respect
to
mary
helen
but
that's
not
the
case
before
this
court.
mary
helen
is
a
company
that
was
in
business
for
some
45
years.
they
have
a
small
number
of
retirees
who
are
still
in
this
plan
and
they
are
the
ones
who
employed
those
retirees
for
long,
for
the
longest
and
none
of
those
retirees
ever
worked
for
any
company
that
signed
the
'78
or
later
agreement.
one
of
the
things
that
has
been
missed
here,
i
think,
is
that
congress
has
set
forth
a
very
detailed
scheme
in
which
they
have
placed
the
lion's
share
of
the
burden
on
those
companies
that
were
the
signatories
to
the
'88
agreement,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
was
in
force
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
passed.
mr.
peter
buscemi
your
honor,
the
most
recent
statistics
as
of
the
beginning
of
the
current
fiscal
year
are
as
follows.
there
are
currently
76,933
beneficiaries
in
the
combined
benefit
fund.
of
those
76,933,
20
percent,
15,469
are
unassigned.
mr.
peter
buscemi
15,469,
20.1
percent.
6,628
or
8.6
percent
are
assigned
to
companies
that
did
not
sign
the
1978
or
later
nbcwa.
and
i
might
say
that--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--well,
your
honor,
the
possibility
of
alternative
funding
is
not,...
i
mean,
sure,
the
health
care
costs
for
6,628
people
could
be
paid
for,
i
suspect,
out
of
the
treasury.
but
there
are
competing
demands,
as
your
honor
is
aware,
for
that
money.
and
congress...
one
of
the
things
that--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--that's
right.
and
that
includes,
i
should
say
that
includes
the
1,332
because
that
includes
the
1,332
that
eastern
has
because--
mr.
peter
buscemi
--eastern
had
a
subsidiary
but
when
the
funds
list
eastern
because
of
the
point
that
justice
scalia
made,
we
list
eastern
in
the
pre-'78
group.
mr.
peter
buscemi
it
would
be
about
5,000
beneficiaries
out
of
the
76,000
that
would
still
be
left
that
have
been
assigned
to
pre-'78
signatories.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes,
your
honor.
one
of
the
things
that
we
sort
of
have
overlooked
here
is
what
situation
congress
considered.
congress
didn't
just
think
about
this
alternative.
congress
thought
about
leaving
it
to
collective
bargaining.
that
they
recognized
wasn't
going
to
work
because
the
people
weren't
around.
we
have
less
than
half
of
the
beneficiaries
who
are
assigned
to
people
who
were
signatories
to
the
current
agreement.
congress
thought
about
just
imposing
the
liability
on
the
'78
or
later
signatories.
mr.
peter
buscemi
yes.
mr.
peter
buscemi
the
bill
was
a
little
different,
justice
o'connor,
the
bill
had
two
features.
with
respect
to
those
beneficiaries
who
could
be
assigned
to
former
employers
that
had
signed
the
'78
or
later
agreement,
those
former
employers
had
to
pay.
with
respect
to
the
beneficiaries
who
could
not
be
assigned
either
because
they
had
no
former
employer
in
business
or
because
it
was
all
pre-1978,
there
was
a
fee
imposed
across
the
board
on
the
industry
as
a
whole
whether
or
not
there
was
any
relationship
to
the
collective
bargain
multiemployer
system,
and
that
bill
was
part
of
a
larger
bill,
an
omnibus
tax
bill,
that
was
vetoed,
and
of
course
we
don't
know
precisely
why
it
was
vetoed.
we
do
know
that
there
was
nothing
in
the
veto
message
that
specified
any
objection
to
that
particular
bill.
congress
made
the
decision
to
impose
this
liability
on
all
nbcwa
signatories
and
as
i
understand
the
argument
here,
petitioner
says
that
any
of
these
decisions
that
congress
might
have
made
would
have
been
fine
except
for
the
one
that
they
did
make.
they
could
have
imposed
it
on
the
taxpayers,
they
could
have
imposed
it
on
the
coal
industry.
they
could
have
imposed
it
only
on
the
'78
or
later
signatories.
they
could
have
imposed
it
on
the
'88
signatories.
all
of
that
would
have
been
fine.
just
this
particular
choice
is
not
fine,
and
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
ignores
the
nature
of
this
multiemployer
system.
as
the
second
circuit
said
in
upholding
the
statute
in
the
ltv
case,
this
system
contained
this
latent
problem
or
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
the
latent
loophole
from
the
beginning
because
as
employers
like
eastern
accorded
their
beneficiaries
service
credits
and
built
up
that
20
years
that
you
needed
to
get
the
health
care,
those,
and
beneficiaries
were
accumulating
and
they
were
staying
around
but
some
of
the
employers
were
leaving
and
that
was
the
problem
that
was
inherent
in
the
system.
thank
you,
your
honor.
