unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
substantive
due
process
or
procedural
due
process?
unknown
speaker
i
suggest
you
are
going
to
have
to
if
you
are
going
to
persuade
us.
unknown
speaker
you
went...
it
went
through
the
legislative
process.
that's
probably
all
a
procedural
due
process
you
are
entitled
to.
you
fall
back
on
a
substantive
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
substantive
due
process
as
you
know
is
not
in
good
odor
with
regard
to
economic
rights
for
some
reason,
although
we
still
apply
it
with
respect
to
noneconomic
rights.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
your
client
is
not,
maybe
as
sympathetic
a
client
as
some
of
the
ones
talked
about
in
some
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
case.
i
guess
eastern
sold
the
coal
mining
operation
to
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
was
cross
management.
i
mean,
some
of
the
same
managers
of
eastern
were
also
managers
of
the
subsidiary
corporation,
so
eastern
doesn't
come
here
in
the
same
shoes
as
some
of
the
amici.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question
and
then
i'll
subside
here.
you
have
a
right
of
reimbursement.
is
that
right?
from
eastern
for
any
liability
incurred
here?
unknown
speaker
did
eastern
preserve
a
right
of
recovery
against
its
subsidiary?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
tell
us
the
amount
and
the
extent
of
the
liability
and
the
number
of
the
employees?
is
that...
is
that
known
at
this
time?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
disputed
to
the
extent,
at
least,
that
you
would
have
a
deduction
for
that
expense,
so
that
would
bring
that
down
a
considerable
amount
without
any
other
factor.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
your
position
is
that
eastern,
which
severed
its
relationship
with
these
employees
many
decades
ago,
should
not
be
responsible.
on
your
theory,
if
any
private
party
in
this
picture,
eastern's
successors,
can
anybody
compatibly
with
substantive
due
process
or
the
takings
clause
be
responsible
or
is
this
the
kind
of
obligation
that
can
be
thrust
only
on
the
public
as
a
whole
through
the
revenue
system?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anybody...
let's
take
this
case
specifically.
are
either
of
the
successors...
suppose
the
tax...
scratch
that.
suppose
this
liability
had
been
imposed
on
peabody.
under
your
theory,
would
that
be
compatible
with
due
process?
unknown
speaker
would
be
peabody
who...
currently
in
the
business.
unknown
speaker
but
which...
these
are...
these
are
miners
who
stopped
working
in
the
mines
in
the
1960s.
unknown
speaker
who
in
this
picture
would
be
responsible
for
them?
unknown
speaker
would
that
be
compatible
with
due
process,
just
concentrating
on
the
people
who
never
worked
for
any
existing
company?
unknown
speaker
these
employees,
these
very
employees,
would
it
be
compatible
with
due
process
to
distribute
them
among
employers
who
never
had
any
employment
relationship
with
them?
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
notice?
what
was
the
expectation
that
these
present
companies
had
that
this
would
occur?
i'm
not
sure...
how
you
can
be
so
categorical
as
to
say
that
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
presents
no
due
process
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
for
employees
who
were
never
beneficiaries
of
that
plan.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
they
are
as
remote
from
responsibility
as
you
are.
unknown
speaker
which
ones
wouldn't
be?
unknown
speaker
which
ones
who
never
employed
these
people
or
their
decedents
would
be
any
closer
to
responsibility.
justice
scalia,
it's
critical
to
understand
that
those
who
signed
collective
bargaining
agreements
from
period
to
period,
when
they
executed
those
agreements,
they
undertook
an
obligation
to
the
very
employees
who
have
been
assigned
to
eastern,
the
very
individuals
who
were
beneficiaries
of
each
of
those
plans.
but
they
didn't
undertake
this
obligation.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
fact
that
i
agree
to
do
something
for
a
certain
amount...
i
don't
quite
understand
your
distinction.
unknown
speaker
well,
shouldn't,
shouldn't
you
by
a
similar
line
of
reasoning
or
shouldn't
eastern
have
understood
that
whatever
its
obligations
may
be,
and
i
realize
those
are
in
question,
but
whatever
its
obligations
may
be,
may
be
affected
by
the
actions
of
the
independent
trustees
so
that
it
at
any
time
in
the
future
this
kind
of
shortfall,
let's
say,
from
imprudent
trustee
action.
imprudent
action
in
determining
the
amount
of
assessments
what
makes
them
might
very
well
result
in
an
added
liability
to
you
or
to
eastern
many,
many
years
hence.
so
i
don't
see
a
distinction
in
kind
between
what
you
have
just
described
as
the,
as
the
latter
imprudent
consequences,
consequence
of
imprudence
in
the
anticipation
that
you
should
have
made
or
eastern
should
have
made
in
imprudent
consequences?
unknown
speaker
with
respect,
perhaps
congressional
action
might
be
difficult
to
anticipate,
but
the
need
for
some
action
even
if
it
be
a
lawsuit,
judicial
action,
possibly,
to
enforce
a
liability
thought
to
have
been
incurred,
that
certainly
is
not
difficult
to
anticipate.
well,
i
suppose
it's
your
position
that
the
liability
only
extended
for
the
life
of
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
much
was
clear.
it
wasn't
like
one
of
these
long
term
continuously
extended
benefit
plans.
they
had
a
limited
term.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
limited
to
the
contribution?
unknown
speaker
but
the
other
side
says
that,
that
congress
found
that
you
had
created
an
expectation
of
lifetime
benefits,
even
though
you
are
only
making
defined
contributions,
you
had
created
an
expectation.
what
is
your
response
to
that?
unknown
speaker
and
the
rest
is
from
the
commission
report
which
the
congress
did
not
itself
adopt.
unknown
speaker
if
in
fact
in
respect
to
expectations
you
had
never
formed
a
separate
subsidiary,
imagine
you
had
never
formed
it
and
you
stayed
in
business
until
1987,
then
would
you
think
it
was
constitutional
for
congress
to
impose
upon
you
the
obligation
that
you
are
talking
about
today?
unknown
speaker
so
in
your
view
if
you
had
been
in
business
until
1987
and
all
the
companies
that
were
in
business
up
until
1992
or
'93
or
before
this
very
act
was
passed,
it's
constitutional
in
your
view
for
congress
to
sell
these
companies
in
the
mining
industry
that
you
have
to
take
care
of
the
miners
who
were
there
previous
to
1992?
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
trying
to
pretend
that
you
never
formed
a
separate
subsidiary
and
therefore
you
continued
to
do
business,
everything
else
is
the
same,
but
you
just
did
business
without
your
separate
subsidiary.
you
were
the
subsidiary
so
you
left
in
'87
instead
of
leaving
in
'65.
i'm
saying
then
in
your
opinion
is
it
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
impose
this
very
obligation
upon
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
want
to
know
if
you
think
it
is
or
isn't
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
then
your
position
is
that
in
fact
they
can't
impose
these
obligations
on
anybody,
however
long
they
stayed
in
as
long
as
they
left
prior
to
this
very
law
being
passed;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
is--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
so
you
think
you
have
a
stronger
case
because
you
left
in
'65?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now
is
your
case
stronger
in
any
respect
at
all
but
for
you
have
some
expectation
that
congress
won't
pierce
corporate
veils?
unknown
speaker
yes.
all
right.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--that's
very
helpful
because
what
i
get
from
your
answer
is
that's
right.
i
think
you
are
saying
the
only
additional
expectation
you
have
is
that
congress
won't
engage
in
veil
piercing
and
then
you
went
on
to
answer
just
what
was
the
next
thing
in
my
mind,
is
is
that
a
reasonable
expectation
given
that
congress
has
passed
quite
a
few
statutes
that
pierce
veils,
cercla,
states
pierce
veils,
veil
piercing
is
not
an
unknown
thing
and
therefore
how
reasonable
is
that
expectation.
now,
you
began
to
answer
that
and
i'd
like
you
to
continue.
unknown
speaker
mr.
montgomery,
i
think
you
are
saying
that
it
doesn't
matter
what
your
expectation
was,
that
even
if
your
expectation
was
that
there
would
be
no
veil
piercing,
that
expectation
has
not
been
frustrated.
unknown
speaker
that
the
basis
for
your
liability
here
is
not
veil
piercing.
unknown
speaker
are
you
putting
all
your
eggs
in
the
due
process
basket,
i
take
it,
today?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
he
had
a
takings
claim?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
cases
in
which
there
is
a
taking
but
the
government
has
not
been
enriched?
here
the
government
doesn't
take
property
and
use
it
for
a
firehouse
or
a
park
or
a
school.
as
the
government
projects
the
argument
to
us,
this
is
simply
an
adjustment
of
liability
between
two
private
parties.
what,
what
case
do
you
have
where
that
occurred
and
we
found
there
was
a
taking?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
argument
is
made,
i
think
in
respect
to
this
singling
out
and
it's
made
with
respect
to
the
rationality
under
the
due
process
argument
that
you
are
not
being
improperly
singled
out
because
as
i
think
you
mentioned
earlier,
because
of
the
finding
in
the
committee
report
that
you
in
effect
had
created
the
expectation
that
the
benefits
were
going
to
be
lifetime
benefits.
if
we,
if
we
find
that
report
something
that
we
ought
to
consider
significant,
and
if
we
also
bear
in
mind
what
is
in
one
of
the
red
briefs,
and
that
was
a
statement
by
an
industry
representative,
i
think
it
may
have
been,
maybe
it
was
the
first
independent
trustee,
mr.
owen,
i
think,
exactly
that
effect,
the
fact
about
1950,
what
argument
do
you
have
that
we
should
in
effect
overlook
that
finding
which
does
establish
a
connection?
can
we
make
fact
finding
of
our
own?
does
the
record
indicate
that
that
conclusion
is
so
far
unsupported
as
to
be
irrational?
i
think
that's
your
burden.
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
it
also
affect
your
takings
argument?
unknown
speaker
it
was
not
a
committee
report
that
made
the
finding,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
appointed
by
the
department
of
labor?
unknown
speaker
if
we
accept
the
finding
as
significant
in
the
decision
in
this
case
in
judging
the
nexus,
the
rationality,
however
you
want
to
put
it
under
the
different
headings
of
your
argument,
then
in
fact
it
is
not
a
fig
leaf
simply
for
a
finding
of
unlimited
liability.
it
is
in
fact
a
basis
for
identifying
a
class
with
respect
to
whom
liability
is
at
least
arguably
quite
reasonable,
and
so
i
think
it
has
greater
significance
than
you
are
willing
to
accord
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
government's
argument
in
its
footnote
at
page
30
of
the
brief.
and
it
focuses
on
the
1974
agreement
and
it
says
the
fact
that
at
that
time
the
companies
by
the
contract
agreed
to
pay
these
benefits
for
previous
workers
showed
that
there
existed
then
an
expectation.
could
you
address
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
government
would
have
us
say
that
this
was
a
consensus
in
the
industry,
that
this
is
the
duty
of
the
employer
because
of
the
fact
that
wages
have
been
low
and
benefits
have
been
high.
that's
what
i
understand
their
argument
to
be.
unknown
speaker
why
did
the
trustee,
i'm
sorry,
why
did
the
trustee
make
as
i
understand
it
essentially
the
same
statement
in
what
was
it
1950?
way,
way
back.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
but
the
terms
of
his
complaint
were
that
basically
there
had
been
a
promise
of
lifetime
benefits.
unknown
speaker
was
the
trustee
authorized
to
speak
for
the
companies
on
that
point?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
agree
with
you
there
but
the
whole
line
of
questioning
i
think
starts
with
the
assumption
that
we
are
going
to
consider
the
commission
report
and
your
burden,
i
think
if
we
are
going
to
consider
it,
your
burden
is
to
say
that
simply
is
not...
that
is
not
a
reasonable
statement
of
findings
that
can
be
taken
into
consideration,
and
i
suppose
one
item
of
evidence
on
that
would
be
the
fact
that
somebody,
a
trustee,
who
was
theoretically
neither
for
you
nor
for
them
was
saying
something
very
similar
to
that
in
1950.
and
i
think
that
affects
your
burden
is
my
only
point.
unknown
speaker
if
the
government
can
come
back
years
later
and,
say,
hold
you
responsible
for
having
had
a
small
participation
in
putting
out
some
kind
of
tailings
or
toxic
waste
that
people
didn't
even
at
the
time
know
was
toxic
and
so
forth,
why
can't
they
come
back
years
later
and
say
we
are
going
to
hold
you
partly
responsible
for
putting
out
their
millions
of
miners
who
spent
their
working
lives
in
the
industry
and
feel
in
their
old
age
that
somebody
has
given
them
an
expectation
they
will
be
taken
care
of
medically.
what's
the
difference
between
those
two
situations?
unknown
speaker
had
a
very
small
part
in
it.
couldn't
you
have
had
a
very
small
part
in
a
very
large--
unknown
speaker
--so
if
you
caused
in
part
this
expectation
on
behalf
of
the
miners,
then
would
you
say
it
was
the
same
thing?
unknown
speaker
you
are
causing
in
part
their
being
out
there
old
without
medical
care.
unknown
speaker
would
you
explain
to
me
once
more
why
a
company
that's
a
recent
entrant
like
let's
take
in
this
case
ohio
valley
coal,
why
it's
compatible
with
due
process,
and
i
think
you
said
it
was,
to
stick
such
a
company
that's
a
current
player,
it's
a
signatory
to
the
most
recent
contract
with
liability
for
people
who
worked
for
eastern
from
the
'40s
to
the
'60s?
you
seem
to
say
this
is
not
something
that
has
to
be
loaded
on
the
public
at
large,
you
can
put
it
on
the
industry,
but
only
certain
players,
so
i'm
trying
to
understand
why
it's
fair
to
do
it
for
some
and
not
the
others.
unknown
speaker
your
time
just
expired,
mr.
montgomery.
mr.
kneedler.
unknown
speaker
did
congress
say
why
it
decided
that
these
people
shouldn't
simply
shift
for
themselves
the
way
most
other
people
do
if
they
don't
have
a
contractual
right?
unknown
speaker
but
they
were
not
something
that
could
be
enforced
in
a
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
what
was
the
first
time
at
which
miners
were
actually
guaranteed
lifetime
benefits?
unknown
speaker
any,
in
which
of
those
contracts
were
specific
guarantees
of
lifetime
health
benefits
given?
unknown
speaker
for
the
duration
of
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
just
for
the
duration
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
and
what
about
for
the
spouses
and
dependents?
when
was
the
first
time
that
was
provided?
unknown
speaker
was
it
ever
part
of
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out.
when
was
there
specific
provision
for
it
in
a
contract?
unknown
speaker
you
said
earlier
that
despite
the
date
you
just
gave
that
lifetime
benefits
had
been
paid
since
the
1950s,
would
you
expand
on
that?
unknown
speaker
beyond
the
terms
of
the
original
contract?
unknown
speaker
basically
got
rolled
over?
unknown
speaker
you
are
talking
about
lifetime
benefits
to
people
who
were
lucky
enough
to
die
before
the
company
went
out
of
business,
right?
unknown
speaker
widows?
widows
not
while
this
company
was--
unknown
speaker
--for
what
year?
unknown
speaker
so
the
one
thing
that
the
term
of
the
contract
limited
was
the
term
in
which
contributions
are
to
be
made.
unknown
speaker
on
expiration,
no
more
contributions
unless
the
contract
is
renewed
but
under
the
plan
so
long
as
the
plan
was
funded
to
the
extent
it
was
funded
they
would
continue
to
draw
benefits--
unknown
speaker
--but
were
notices
regularly
sent
saying
that
these
aren't
guaranteed
and
they
can
be
terminated?
it
depends
on
whether
we
have
the
money?
weren't
those
regularly
provided?
unknown
speaker
let's
talk
about
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
those
agreements
were
negotiated
with
one
of
the
most
powerful
unions
in
the
country
and
i'm
sure
the
negotiations
could
have
taken
into
account
whether
the
funding
of
this
thing
was
to
be
a
guaranteed
funding
of
whatever
amount
is
necessary
to
provide
lifetime
benefits.
that
was
not
in
the
contract.
they
just
agreed
to
put
in
a
certain
amount
every
year.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
this
was
a
sophisticated
labor
union
who
adopted
that
agreement
on
behalf
of
their
employees.
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
how
that
could
have
created
any
reasonable
expectation
that
the
companies
would
kick
in
whatever
it
takes
to
provide
lifetime
benefits.
it's
very
clearly
said
we
will
kick
in
so
much
each
year.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
did
the
collective
bargaining
agreements
say
that?
if
you
say
that
the
course
of
conduct
made,
where
would
you
expect
to
find
the
employers'
intentions
more
better
placed
or
better
examined
than
in
the
agreements
they
signed?
unknown
speaker
i
thought--
--you
had
to
renew
the
contract
every
three
years--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
kneedler,
with
reference
to
investment
backed
expectations,
i
usually
thought
it
was
the
expectation
of
the
person
who
is
paying
the
liability.
you
are
saying
it
was...
this
was
an
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
miners.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
with
one
question
just
to
be
sure
i
get
it
in
my
mind.
if
the
facts
are
that
these
were
all
defined
contribution
plans,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
that
the
employee...
employers
consistently
said
this
is
going
to
be
the
limit
of
our
liability
and
our
exposure
and
so
forth,
but
the
union
representatives
consistently
told
the
employees
we
are
going
to
take
care
of
you,
we
are
going
to
use
enough
muscle
to
be
sure
that
they
contribute
enough
money.
the
employer
said
well,
we
don't...
we
don't
accept
that.
would
that
still
be
a
sufficient
expectation?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
unions
taking
the
position
they
could
do
it
would
be
enough
the
employees
can
rely
on
that
despite
the
fact,
assuming
that
to
be
the
case,
the
employers
regularly
and
consistently
said
this
is
as
much
as
we
are
going
to
do?
unknown
speaker
and
for
defined
contributions
as
opposed
to
benefits.
unknown
speaker
so
what
you
are
saying
is
the
reasonable
expectations
that
others
have
of
what
claims
they
have
on
your
property
that's
controlling?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying,
aren't
you,
that
the
acts,
the
unilateral,
in
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question,
that
the
unilateral
acts
of
one
party
to
the
agreement
can
create
a
reasonable
expectation
when
the
other
party
says
no.
how
can
that
be
a
reasonable
expect...
source
of
reasonable
expectation
when
on
justice
stevens'
hypothesis
it
is
disputed
from
the
beginning?
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
that's
not
this
case.
did
they
say
anything?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
may
i
ask
you
if
you
can
differentiate
the
following
case
from
what's
going
on
here.
congress
passed
the
equal
pay
act
in
1963,
but
since
world
war
ii,
when
there
was
an
executive
order
that
says
industry,
you
should
pay
minimum
in
the
same
for
the
same
work,
there
had
been
an
expectancy
built
up
that
people
would
be
paid
equally
without
regard
to
sex.
suppose
congress
had
said
in
'63
and
not
only
prospectively
must
the
pay
be
equal
but
we
are
going
to
reach
back
to
the
date
of
that
executive
order
and
every
employer
that
was
in
violation
of
the
equal
pay
principle
in
that
period
will
have
to
cough
up
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
change
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical
a
little
bit
then...
so
you
don't
have
to
pay
off
all
people
against
whom
you...,
you
were
in
violation
of
equal
pay
but
only
those
people
who
are
now
impecunious
as
a
result
of
your
failure
to
have
done
that
in
the
past
so
it
has
the
same
future
application
as
this
statute.
would
that
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
those
people
who
would
otherwise
be
on
welfare
today
whom
you
did
not
give
equal
pay
30
years
ago.
unknown
speaker
i'm
changing
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
30
years
ago.
but
we
are
adopting
the
legal
requirement
today
and
if
anyone
is
on
welfare
today
because
of
your
failure
to
pay,
give
equal
pay
30
years
ago,
you
have
to
take
care
of
their
welfare
needs.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think,
i
think
clearly
it's
an
area
where
one
might
expect
congress
to
step
in
as
it
did
with
erisa
and
provide
some
multiemployer
plans
that
are
specific
and
provide
for
funding.
but
what
we
are
talking
about
is
whether
it's
reasonable
to
think
they
are
going
to
look
back
30-some
years
to
impose
the
liability.
i
mean,
that's
the
shocker.
unknown
speaker
you
have
a
different
situation
probably
if
the
employer
and
the
employment
was
itself
the
cause
of
the
miner's
disease,
than
when
you
were
talking
about
general
benefits,
for
instance,
spouses
and
dependents
and
general
health
care
needs
of
people
unrelated
to
their
service
in
the
mining
industry,
isn't
that
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
a
guarantee
of
benefits.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
guarantee
of
a
certain
amount
of
funding.
unknown
speaker
what
findings
do
we
have
by
congress
here
that
there
was
a
guarantee
of
benefits?
do
we
have
any
finding
by
congress?
unknown
speaker
i
think
justice
scalia
asked
did
congress
make
that
finding.
unknown
speaker
about
a
takings
challenge
and
even
if
there
had
been
in
a
takings
case
a
congressional
finding
that
this
property
belongs
to
the
united
states
anyway
and
we
are
taking
it
for
that
reason.
would
we
be
bound
by
that
fund?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
different
issue.
i'm
not
asking
about
that
issue.
i'm
asking
in
our
takings
jurisprudence
do
we
accept
findings
made
by
the
congress
as
to
whether
the
taking
is
justified
or
not?
unknown
speaker
congress
may
have
concluded
that
and
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
for
congress
to
have
concluded
that
if
congress
concluded
that.
we
don't
know
for
sure
that
congress
concluded
that.
unknown
speaker
why
should
it
just
be
the
coal
company?
let's
suppose,
and
i
think
this
could
be
the
case,
i'm
not
sure,
that
the
real
problem
here
is
the
decline
in
the
price
in
the
market
for
coal,
and
what
happened
was
the
natural
gas
companies
were
taking
all
the
business.
why
shouldn't
the
natural
gas
companies
pay
this?
could,
could
the
congress
say
to
the
national
gas
companies,
because
they
are,
let's
assume
that
they
are
the
ones
that
are
taking
all
of
the
profits,
they
are
the
ones
that
should
pay
the
cost
for
keeping
everybody
warm
until
the
natural
gas
industry
could
develop.
unknown
speaker
so
you
think,
you
think
this
case
would
come
out
just
the
same
way
if
the
natural
gas
companies
had
to
pay
the
liability
that
we
are
talking
about
here?
unknown
speaker
i'm
carefully
tailoring.
is
there
any
exception
for
companies
like
the
mary
helen
coal
corporation,
one
of
the
briefs
spoke
about
the
plight
of
that
company.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
buscemi.
unknown
speaker
but
excuse
me.
the
liability
here
was
not
imposed
on
the
basis
of
the
fact
that
this
was
the
parent
company
of
a
company
that
had
signed
the
later
agreement.
that's
not
the
basis
for
the
imposition
of
a
liability
at
all.
unknown
speaker
that's
an
irrelevant
fact
as
far
as
this
statute
is
concerned.
unknown
speaker
we
look
at
those
aspects
of
the
situation
that
congress
took
into
account
and
made
the
basis
of
liability.
the
fact
that
this
was
the
parent
of
a
subsidiary
that
is
liable
for
some
other
things
was
not
the
basis
of
liability.
unknown
speaker
what
holding,
what
holding,
what
holding
do
you
want
us
to
make
if
the
case
comes
before
us
where
there
is
no
subsidiary
relationship?
unknown
speaker
the
mary
hill
mine,
i
think,
was
mentioned.
maybe
i
have
the
name
wrong.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
factual
circumstance?
that
is,
i
take
in
your
argument
that
basically
in
respect
to
this
company,
even
though
it
isn't
a
veil
piercing
statute,
the
only
extent
to
which
it's
unfair
to
them
involves
the
subsidiary.
it's
a
question
of
fairness.
now,
suppose
you
take
that
out
of
it?
how
many...
are
there
a
lot
of
companies?
is
there
a
lot
of
liability
going
on
here
as
a
practical
matter
involving
companies
just
like
them
that
where
there
is
no
subsidiary
relation
so
that
we
would
have
to
face
this
case,
the
same
question
later?
unknown
speaker
how
many?
unknown
speaker
congress
could
probably
afford
to
take
care
of
them
out
of
general
funds,
wouldn't
you
think?
unknown
speaker
6,628
are
assigned
to
companies
like
eastern
but
that
have
no
subsidiary
that
was
in
the
business
after
'78?
unknown
speaker
but
eastern
had
a
subsidiary.
unknown
speaker
what
i'm
trying
to
think
of
is
the
practical
effect
because
if
you
were
to
win
the
case
on
the
alternate
ground
involving
the
subsidiary
whether
in
fact
that
would
leave
a
lot
of
the
miners,
let's
say,
out
in
the
cold.
unknown
speaker
who
are
not
subsidiaries,
or
who
don't
have
subsidiaries?
unknown
speaker
well,
congress
actually
passed
a
bill
that
didn't
have
this
reach
back
provision
in
it
but
it
was
vetoed,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
then
they
put
in
the
reach
back
thing
that
we
are
talking
about
now.
