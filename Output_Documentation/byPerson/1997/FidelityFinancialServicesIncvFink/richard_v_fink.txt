mr.
richard
v.
fink
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
547(c)(3)
establishes
a
defense
for
enabling
loans.
however,
such
loans
are
only
perfected,
or
only
protected
if
perfected
on
or
before
20
days
after
the
debtor
receives
possession
of
the
property.
the
meaning
of
section
547(c)
is
clear:
20
days
is
20
days
is
20
days.
the
1994
amendment--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--well,
i
would
agree
that
the
definition
is
what...
what
the
court
or
the
congress
was
looking
at
in
section
547
was
the
act
of
perfection,
not
the
status
of
being
perfected,
and
in
order
to
have
the...
to
be
perfected
under
the
statute,
you
must
take
that
last
step
within
20
days
of
the
transaction.
the
congress
back
in
1994
recognized
that
several
states
had
adopted
enabling
loan
grace
periods
longer
than
the
10-day
period
allowed
under
the
1978
bankruptcy
code.
rather
than
incorporate
the
varying
state
law
periods,
the
congress
instead
expanded
the
20-day
period
to
a
nationally
uniform
20
days.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
justice
breyer,
that's
an
excellent
point,
but
the
statute
doesn't
say
could
not
prevail,
it
says
cannot
prevail.
that
requires
looking
forward
prospectively,
not
looking
backwards
retroactively
to
what
actually
happened.
if
congress
had
intended
that
you
look
back,
the
actual
happenstance,
they
would
have
said,
could
not
have
perfected,
but
congress
didn't
say
that.
congress
specifically
said
cannot.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
could
not
have
prevailed,
yes,
sir.
thank
you.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
my
position
is
that
that
defines
the
steps
necessary,
and
you
can
look
at
state
law
to
see
what
those
steps
would
be
to
perfect,
but
as
to
whether
you
were
actually
perfected
within
the
time
frame
that
congress
envisioned,
which
was
a
uniform
20
days,
you
would
look
to
federal
law,
not
the
state.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
justice
ginsburg,
it's
my
interpretation
of
the
code
and
it's
the
congressional
intent
that
there
be
a
uniform
20-day
period.
under
the
bankruptcy
act,
section
60(a)(7)
said
you
have
21
days,
but
if
a
state
provides
for
a
shorter
period,
you're
stuck
with
the
state
law.
if
the
state
provides
for
a
longer
period,
you're...
you
get
to
use
the
federal
statute.
the
congress
looked
at
that,
the
gilmore
commission,
which
was
trying
to
conform
the
u.c.c.
and
the
bankruptcy
act,
told
congress
in
its
report,
lose
the
state
law
period.
it
recommended
21
days
not
because
there
was
any
logic
to
it,
but
because
that's
what
people
were
used
to.
the
congress
chose
to
adopt
the
gilmore
committee
recommendation
with
the
exception
of
the
21-day
period.
it
chose
the
10-day
period,
which
was
then
the
prevailing
u.c.c.
period.
the
plain
meaning--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--yes,
sir.
the...
if
the
creditor
had
the
misfortune
of
having
their
client
file
a
bankruptcy,
they
would
be
better
off
as
far
as
perfection
is
concerned
than
they
would
have
been
absent
that
bankruptcy,
the
intervening
bankruptcy.
prior
to
1994,
there
was
a
problem.
the
problem
was
cases
such
as
in
re
burnette,
that
recognized
the
congressional
intent
of
a
uniform
national
time
period,
but
instead
chose
a
perceived
public
policy
of
favoring
that
one
creditor
who
had
done
everything
right
under
state
law
but
had
failed
to
perfect
within
the
time
frame
allowed
by
the
bankruptcy
code.
one
purpose
of
preference
law
is
to
avoid
the
pitfalls
of
secret
liens.
any
creditor
who
fails
to
disclose
their
lien
in
a
timely
and
proper
manner
loses
their
ability
to
enforce
that
lien
against
the
world.
if
they
take
the
proper
steps
to
attach
their
security
interest
as
between
the
debtor
and
themselves,
they
have
some
protection,
but
if
they
fail
to
take
the
steps
in
the
time
frame
prescribed
by
the
statute,
whether
it
be
state
law
if
you're
in
the
state
realm
or
bankruptcy
law,
if
you
happen
to
be
in
a
bankruptcy
setting,
because
it's
a
uniform
federal
policy,
then
they
lose
their
ability
to
enforce
that
lien
against
the
bankruptcy
estate
in
the
chapter
7
or
chapter
13
or
chapter
11
if
there's
a
preference
proceeding
filed.
the
petitioner
argues
that
its
interpretation
follows
the
plain
language
of
the
post
1994
amendment
to
the
statute.
i
don't
understand,
if
it's
so
plain,
why
every
recorded
case,
all
the
commentators,
all
the
scholars
reject
their
position.
there's
no
support
for
their
position
that
the
1994
amendment
to
section
547
makes
state
law
relation-back
periods
apply
in
a
bankruptcy
setting.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
at
the
circuit
level?
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i
don't
know,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i
don't
know
if
there
are
any.
i'm
just
not
familiar
with
that.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i'm
not
familiar
with
any
circuit
court
opinions
in
the
ninth
and
tenth
that
have
reconsidered
that
issue,
justice
ginsburg.
the
circuits
that
have
recon...
that
have
ruled
on
that
issue
since
the
'94
would
be
the
fifth,
the
eighth,
and
the...
now
it's
escaped
me.
the
eleventh,
i
believe.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i
might
have
those
twisted
around.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i
may...
justice
breyer--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--that
was
an
act
that
wasn't
even...
that
didn't
even
get
passed,
although
the
language
is
similar
to
the
act
that
eventually--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--it
was
amended
in
'94.
i
think
it
shows
that
there
is...
at
best,
it
shows
that
they
didn't
understand
each
other's
position.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
just--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--the
history
of
that
i
can't
speak
to,
but
i
know
that
the
committee
report
would
have
more
bearing
than
their
colloquy,
and
the
hist...
and
the
committee
report
on
the
1994
amendment
states
that
they
were
going
for
a
uniform
20
days.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
can't
speak
to
that,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
oh,
i
don't
think
that
that's
what
mr.
heflin
said,
senator
heflin.
i
think...
if
i
can
find
it
here.
0....
i
think
senator
heflin,
on
page
27
of
the
brief
it
is
quoted
that
he
clarifies
senator
sasser's
point
and
asserts
that
state
law
relation-back
statutes
do
not
affect
the
time
of
transfer
pursuant
to
section
547,
to
which
senator
sasser
replied,
and
i
quote,
federal
uniformity
is
key
to
the
date
on
which
the
debtor
receives
possession
of
such
property,
which
then
activates
the
running
of
the
20-day
period
under
section
547.
i
don't
see
that
he
was
disagreeing.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
well,
that's
the
only
explanation
i
can
ascribe
to
that,
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
mr.
richard
v.
fink
congress
certainly
knows
how
to
incorporate
state
law
when
it
wants
to
do
so.
section
546(b)
provides
that
certain
trustees'
avoiding
powers
are
subject
to
any
general
applicable
law
which
would
include
state
law.
noticeably
absent
from
that
section
is
section
547.
they
exclude...
they
make
general
applicable
law
applicable
to
the
strong
arm
powers
under
section
544,
the
statutory
lien
powers
under
section
545,
and
the
post-petition
liens
under
section
549,
but
they
exclude
section
547.
i
think
that
supports
the
intent,
that
they
intended
that
there
be
a
uniform
20
days,
and
that
20
days
meant
20
days.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
make
state
law
applicable,
as
fidelity
asserts,
then
it
should
have
simply
inserted
in
section
546(b)
section
547.
they
didn't
do
that.
it's
my--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--sure.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
the
simplest
way
to
adopt
applicable
state
law,
in
section
546(b)(1)
there's
a
statement
that
says,
general
applicable
law
applies
in
these
statutes,
544,
545,
and
549.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
section
547,
and
it's
my
understanding
that
the
exclusion
of
one
means
that
the
other...
it
means
that
they
intended
to
exclude
it.
i
had
a
fancy
latin
phrase
for
that,
and
now
it's
escaping
my
memory.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
that
wasn't
it.
fidelity
has
argued
that
automobile
lenders
need
additional
time,
that
they're
special.
there's
nothing
in
section
547
that
says
anything
about
motor
vehicle
lenders
being
special.
the
only
differentiation
is
between
the
general
rule
for
10
days
to
perfect
and
have
the
grace
period
apply,
or
for
enabling
loans,
the
20-day
period,
so
it's
the
type
of
the
loan,
not
the
type
of
collateral
that's
critical.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
which
brings
up--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--i
don't
know.
in
missouri,
it's
a
simple
form
you
fill
out.
you
mail
it
in
with
the
certificate
of
title
attached.
if
you
don't
have
the
certificate
of
title,
it's
my
reading
of
the
state
statute
that
it
would
be
an
illegal
transaction
to--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--yes,
sir,
and
under
state
law
that
certainly
could
happen.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i
don't
believe
that
that
would
be
the
appropriate
manner
of
transferring
title
to
a
vehicle.
i
believe
you
have
to
transfer
possession
at
the
same
time
that
you--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--i
think
they're
just
going
to
be
out
of
luck,
and
i
think
congress
looked
at
that
and
was
trying
to
balance
the
state
interests
versus
the
federal
interest.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i
misunderstood
the...
i
wasn't
thinking
clearly
on
the
question.
it's
not
an
issue
of
when
the
state
processes
the
paperwork.
the
issue
is
when
the
paperwork
gets
to
the
state,
so
that
should
have
no
impact
on
the
hypothetical
that
you
described,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i'm
not
familiar
with
all
the
motor
vehicle
statutes--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--in
the
50
states,
but
in
missouri--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--that
would
be
the
critical
date.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
i
believe
in
this
case
the
bankruptcy
judge
ruled
that
the
date
that
it
was
received
was
the
effective
date
of
transfer,
and
at
worst...
that
was
21
days
out.
at
worst
it
was
26
days
out.
but
the
problem
in
this
case--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--i
don't
know.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
no,
sir.
fidelity
has
argued
that
there's
a
serious
conflict
between
our
interpretation
of
section
547
and
state
commercial
law,
especially
as
it
relates
to
motor
vehicles.
that
simply
isn't
true.
our
interpretation
affects
only
a
handful
of
states.
there
are
seven
with
grace
periods
longer
than
20
days,
and
even
in
those
states,
the
longer
grace
periods
typically
apply
only
to
motor
vehicles,
so
how
do
we
read
the
plain
language
of
section
547?
congress
expanded
the
section
547(c)(3)(b)
period
from
10
days
to
20
days.
it
also
added
an
express
cross-reference
to
the
general
timing
rule
of
section
547(e)(2)(a)
to
the
new
20-day
rule.
thus,
all
secured
creditors
have
a
10-day
grace
period
to
perfect
their
security
interest
and
have
the
date
of
the
transfer
be
deemed
the
date
of
perfection.
congress
realized
there
was
a
problem,
that
sometimes
there
could
be
a
delay
with
enabling
loan
creditors,
so
it
gave
them
an
extra
10
days,
for
a
total
of
20,
and
said,
you
know,
in
every
circumstance
this
may
not
be
enough,
but
this
is
the
balance
we're
going
to
strike
between
the
state
interest
and
the
federal
uniform
interest
in
a
uniform
bankruptcy
law
and
said,
20
days.
and
it
may
be
true
that
a
1-day
delay
in
this
case
doesn't
seriously
threaten
the
antisecret
lien
policy.
even
if
you
use
the
30-day
relation-back
period
in
missouri,
maybe
that
doesn't
seriously
cause
any
serious
harm.
however,
it's
the
interpretation
that
you
must
adopt
in
order
to
reach
that
result,
which
is
dangerous.
there's
nothing
in
fidelity's
argument
to
limit
its
theory.
you
could
have
a
state
that
says
you
could
have
a
year.
you
could
have
a
state
that
says
you
don't
even
have
to
do
it
for
an
enabling
loan.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
oh,
i
don't
think
that's
what
they
said,
and
they
don't
need
to
harmonize
with
the
state
law,
because
it's
federal
bankruptcy
law
that's
at
issue.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
well,
congress
certainly
could
have
done
that.
it's
within
their
power
to
do
that.
but
they
didn't
do
that.
they
said,
20
days.
they
didn't
make
an
exception
in
546(b)
to
apply
general
applicable
law
to
section
547.
so
we're
not
here
today
to
determine
what
congress
could
have
done.
we're
here
to
determine
or
interpret
what
congress
did
do,
and
congress
established
a
uniform
20-day
period
to
take
that
last
step
necessary
to
perfect
your
security
interest.
if
you
don't
do
it,
you're
just
out
of
luck.
that
happens
every
day
in
preference
actions
in
bankruptcy.
people...
preferences
aren't
about
evil
intent,
or
whether
something
bad
or
good
happened.
it's...
the
transactions
take
place
in
the
normal
course
of
commercial
practice,
and
if
you're
outside
that
time
limit
that
congress
drew,
and
somebody's
filed
a
bankruptcy,
you're
just
going
to
be
out
of
luck,
whether
it's
20
days,
or
21...
i'm
sorry,
if
it's
21
days
or
a
year.
and
the
position
they're
arguing
doesn't
accommodate
federal
law
to
the
state
law.
they're
asking
congress,
or
this
court
to
interpret
that
statute
to
advocate
to
state
law,
because
there
would
be
nothing
to
prevent
a
state...
even
though
none
of
them
have
done
it
yet,
there's
nothing
to
prevent
them
from
coming
in
and
saying,
you've
got
a
year
to
perfect.
idaho
changed
their
statute
precisely
to
try
and
defeat
a
bankruptcy
trustee
to
say
it
impacted
on
not
just
enabling
loans
on
motor
vehicles,
but
nonenabling
loans
as
well,
so
once
you
start
down
that
slope,
there's
no
stopping
it.
it's
just
a
snowball
that
just
keeps
getting
bigger
and
bigger.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
that's
similar,
and
in
a
motor
vehicles...
in
a
non-u.
c.c.
setting
that
would
be
what
you
would
call
a
purchase
money
security
interest.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
sir.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
well--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--well,
actually
the
vehicle
i
think
was
worth
around
10,000,
the
debt
was
around
14.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
yes,
sir,
because
the
lien
didn't
go
away.
they
don't
have
the
lien.
i
now
have
the
lien
on
behalf
of
the
bankruptcy
estate
under
section
551,
and
ms.
beasley
is
paying
that
value
out
to
all
the
creditors,
including
fidelity,
who
are
general
unsecured--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--it's
a...
since
it's
a
chapter
13,
you
basically
have
two
tests
that
have
to
be
met
for
the
general
unsecured
creditors.
disposable
income,
which
is
section
1325(b),
that
means
that
during
the
life
of
her
plan
all
her
disposable
income,
which
is
the
income
that's
not
necessary
for
support,
has
to
be
paid
into
the
plan,
and
also
that
the
liquidation
test
is
met,
which
is
1325(a)(4).
so
she's
basically...
she
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
money,
so
she's
basically
paying
out
the
value
of
that
vehicle
to
the
general
unsecured
creditors,
and
that's
going
to
take
her
more
than
3
years
with
all
her
disposable
income,
and
i
don't
recall
off
the
top
of
my
head
what
the
total
percentage
to
the
general
unsecured
will
be,
but
fidelity
is
the
largest
unsecured
creditor,
so
you're
probably
looking
at
less
than
a
50-percent
distribution,
but
i
don't
know
that.
mr.
richard
v.
fink
well,
actually,
all
the
chapter
13
debtors
in
the
western
district
of
missouri
are
financing
this--
[laughter]
--side
of
it,
because--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--but
a
chapter--
mr.
richard
v.
fink
--a...
yes,
sir.
a
chapter...
this
actually
started
as
a
chapter
7,
where
the
trustee
said,
give
me
the
car,
they're
not
perfected,
and
ms.
beasley
decided
to
convert
to
chapter
13.
are
there
any
further
questions
from
the
court?
if
not,
i'll
just
summarize,
and
i
would
ask
that
the...
respectfully
request
that
you
affirm
the
opinion
of
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals,
because
it's
the
only
interpretation
that
gets
force
through
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
it's
the
only
interpretation
which
advances
the
antisecret
lien
policy
of
the
congress.
it's
the
only
interpretation
that's
in
accord
with
the
legislative
history
of
both
the
'78
code,
the
'94
amendment,
and
with
the
pre-code
bankruptcy
law,
and
thank
you
for
your
time.
