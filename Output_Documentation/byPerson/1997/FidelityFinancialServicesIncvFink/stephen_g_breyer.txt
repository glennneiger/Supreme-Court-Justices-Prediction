justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
that's
right,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
isn't
just
what
justice
scalia
said
right?
i
mean,
if
it
isn't
right,
i'm
not
understanding
this
whole--
--i
think
it's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no--
[laughter]
i
don't
necessarily
accept
that
argument,
but
the...
i
mean,
do
we
understand
this
correctly?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
an
additional
argument
in
your...
is
what
i
said
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is
correct.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
that
gives
meaning
to
this.
now,
your
point
is
that
whether
you
win
or
you
lose
it
has
meaning,
as
i
take
it.
now,
you're
making
an
additional
point
that
if
a
state
which
has
a
statute
that
says
it
is
perfected
beyond
the
20-day
period,
of
which
there
are
only
seven--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
that
state
also
says,
by
the
way,
you
are
to
consider
it
as
having
been
perfected
much
earlier,
on
day
1,
then
it
is
for
purposes
of
the
federal
statute
perfected
earlier,
within
the
20-day
period.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then...
go
ahead.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--how
long
is
the
u.c.c.
period,
grace
period?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
no,
they
have...
a
lot
of
them,
under
the
u.c.c.
they
have
10
days,
all
right,
so
there
are
a
number
of
states
apparently
that
give
you
20
days,
is
that
right,
and
a
large
number
of
states
that
give
you
10
days.
some
give
you
10
days
with
the
u.c.c.,
some
give
you
20
days.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
the
language
is
somewhat
ambiguous,
allows
it,
and
everything
seems
fairly
mixed
up
state
after
state,
why
shouldn't
we
just
say,
well,
a
uniform
rule
is
probably
what
they
intended
in
order
to
avoid
the
kind
of
confusion
that
our
questions
suggest
might
arise?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question
i
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--let
me
do
it
with
an
example.
imagine
a
state...
this
is
something
i
don't
understand.
imagine
a
state
has
a
statute.
state
1
says,
you
have
to
perfect
by
sending
the
paper
in
to
the
secretary
of
state
within
30
days,
or
sending
the
paper
wherever
you're
supposed
to
send
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
state
2
says
the
same
thing,
but
adds
the
words,
and
perfection
relates
back
to
day
1.
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out,
what's
the
difference?
imagine
that
on
day
20
in
either
state
a
simple
judgment
creditor
files
a
piece
of
paper
and
says,
i'm
entitled
to
the
car.
isn't
it
true
that
in
both
states,
if
the
right
piece
of
paper
is
filed
before
day
30,
between
day
20
and
day
30,
that
the
secured
creditor
will
prevail
over
the
simple
contract
creditor?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
if
in
both
states
they
would
prevail,
then
adding
the
words,
and
it
relates
back
to
day
1,
does
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
it
does
nothing,
well
then
our
question
becomes
one
of
whether
congress
intended,
by
using
the
words
20
days,
suddenly
to
permit
any
state,
irrespective
of
whether
it
says
relates
back
or
not,
that
has
30
days
or
60
days
to
perfect,
to
fall
within
the
meaning
of
the
20
days.
that's
pretty
hard
to
see.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that's
your...
that's
what
we
have
to...
for
you
to
win
we
have
to
agree
with
that.
isn't
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
even
if
it
doesn't
say,
since
we
have
a
definition
of
what
perfection
means,
even
if
a
state
says
60
days
and
says
nothing
about
relating
back,
on
your
argument
that
state
rule
would
still
prevail.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
or
the
trustee
in
bankruptcy.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--before
you
leave
the
language,
what
you
do
with
the
language
of
the
definition
of
when
it's
perfected?
it
says
it
is
perfected
when
a
creditor
on
a
simple
contract
cannot
acquire
a
judicial
lien
that
is
superior
to
the
interest
of
the
transferee.
so
if
we
have
a
state
that
says
it's
perfected,
you
have
60
days
in
which
to
file,
once
you
file
on
those
60
days,
a
simple
contract
debtor
that
filed
on
day
15,
or
on
day
20,
or
on
day
30,
or
on
day
40
cannot
prevail
and,
therefore,
under
the
language,
they
say
it
was
the
case,
given
their
statute,
that
from
day
1,
provided
that
later
filing
took
place,
a
simple
contract
creditor
could
not
prevail.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
could
not
have
prevailed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
i
understand
it,
you...
your
position
is
that
that
section,
547(e)(1)(b),
means
simply,
has...
have
all
the
steps
been
taken
to
perfect
the
lien,
so
it
tells
us,
yes,
the
lien
has
been
perfected,
but
is
uninformative
on
relation-back.
that's
the
uniform
20-day
period.
is
that,
in
essence,
your
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
the
colloquy
in
the
legislative
history?
i...
in
the
bankruptcy
act,
unlike
a
lot
of
other
acts,
these
colloquys
were
pretty
carefully
worked
out
by
all
the
different
parties
who
were
involved
in
the
legislation,
so
i
might
be
tempted
to
pay
more
attention
to
senators
sasser
and
heflin
in
this
kind
of
context
than
in
a
lot
of
others.
how
did
that
come
about?
normally
what
happens
with
these
colloquys
is
the
bankruptcy
bar
and
all
the
different
people
interested
go
and
write
what
they're
supposed
to
say
in
order
to
clarify
for
the
courts
what
they
meant.
there's
quite
a
definite
colloquy
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
did
that
come
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah...
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
there
would
be
somebody
who
would
have
written
that.
they
didn't
sit
and
write
it
themselves.
you
don't
really
think
that
they...
that
either
one
of
them
was
that
familiar
with
the
particular
little
tiny--
--yeah.
--piece
of
this
statute
that
was
at
issue.
right.
but
that's
how
the
legislative
process
works.
people
who
are
interested
go
and
write
colloquys.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
done
intentionally.
so
i
want
to
know
what
the
history
of
that
was.
do
you
know
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
quick
question
about
perfection.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
imagine
in
a
state
that
has
a
60-day
period,
or
a
30-day
period--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
take
out
a
loan,
but
you
don't
perfect
for
a
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
correct
in
thinking
the
person
who
didn't
perfect
for
a
year,
the
secured
creditor,
still
has
perfected
his
interest,
but
only
in
respect
to
the
future,
not
in
respect
to
the
past?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
thank
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think,
isn't
it...
that's
what
i've
looked
up
on
this,
that
these
were
amendments
attached
to
a
crime
bill,
and
senator
heflin
was
the
floor
manager
of
the
crime
bill,
and
then
therefore
he
had
to
answer
whatever
question
came
up.
but
it
is
significant
to
me
what
that
situation
was,
because
if
these
two
were
primary
movers
of
the
whole
thing,
then
of
course
it
doesn't
reflect
their
views
as
much
as
it
reflects
an
entire
community
of
people
trying
to
enact
a
comprehensive
code.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
it's
a
particular
senator
who
happens
to
have
a
constituent,
et
cetera,
that's
quite
different.
but
you
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
