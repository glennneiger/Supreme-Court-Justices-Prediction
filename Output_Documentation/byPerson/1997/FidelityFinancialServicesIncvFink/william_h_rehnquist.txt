chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-11370,
fidelity
financial
services,
inc.
v.
fink.
mr.
gaughan.
is
that
the
correct
pronunciation
of
your
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
please
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
satisfied
the
requirement
of
missouri
law,
as
you
said,
but
it
did
not
do
it
within
20
days.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
20-day
requirement
has
no
independent
significance.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
states,
when
a
state
comes
to
adopt
a
uniform
commercial
code,
at
least
this
was
the
experience
in
arizona,
it
isn't
adopted
just
verbatim
from
the
u.c.c.
draft.
there
are
changes,
so
that
there
might
be
change...
different
grace
periods
among
states,
all
of
which
have
adopted
the
uniform
commercial
code.
isn't
that
true?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gaughan.
mr.
fink,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
authority
for
that,
gertrude
stein?
[laughter]
anyway,
i
think
the
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
perfected
is
perfected
is
perfected,
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
under
your
theory
the
massachusetts
hypothesis,
where
the
period
is
shorter
than
20
days,
that
person
would
have
the...
be
able
to
take
advantage
of
the
federal
20-day
period,
so
you
have...
you'd
have
a
uniform
period
throughout.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
answer
justice
ginsburg's
question?
yeah.
you
said
in
your
brief
that
the
colloquy
was
ambiguous,
and
i
understood
the
argument
that
it
shouldn't
count
for
much,
but
i
didn't
understand
in
what
way
it
was
ambiguous.
how
could
they
have
been
clearer
than
to
say,
we
think
this
confirms
the
tenth
and
eleventh
circuit
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--res
ipsa
loquitur.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
they're
out
of
luck,
it's
because
of
state
law
and
not
federal
law,
isn't
it...
because
if
you
send
in
the
papers
the
day
after
you
transfer
possession,
you've
complied
with
the
federal
law--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--have
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
if
the
state
can't
process
it
within
30
days,
the
problem
is
with
the
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's...
is
an
enabling
loan...
is...
that
can
mean
the
same
thing
as
a
purchase
money
mortgage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fink.
mr.
gaughan,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
don't
ordinarily
sit
to
review
facts,
mr.
gaughan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we've
been
presented
with
a
set
of
facts
that
said
that
it
was
either
21
days
or
26
days
afterwards.
i
think
we
accept
those.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr
gaughan.
the
case
is
submitted.
