justice
david
h.

then
we
have
to
accept
the
possibility
that
in
place
of
the
30
days
here
it
could
be
the
60
days
in
west
virginia,
i
think
it
is,
it
could
be
a
year
in
some
state,
if
some
state
wanted
to
take
that
position...
in
effect,
there
would
be
no
guaranteed
end
point
on
your
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
nothing
is
gained
that
would
not
be
gained
by
having
the
general
10-day
period.
as
long
as
state
law
says
it
relates
back
to
day
1,
or
sometime
within
the
first
10
days,
then
nothing
was
accomplished.
no
change
in
the
law
of
any
practicallity
that
i
can
see
was
accomplished
by
providing
the
second
20-day
period
for
these
kinds
of
loans.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
did
congress
do
it?
well...
then
i
don't
understand
this.
i
read
an
amicus
brief...
it's
quite
possible
i
don't,
by
the
way.
in
an
amicus
brief
it
said
there
are
23
states
that
have
no
relation-back,
so
i
thought
that
those
states,
those
23
states,
i
don't
know
what
their
perfection
laws
provide,
but
some
of
those
23
states
could
say
that
a
secured
interest
is
perfected
at
the
time
of
filing,
and
that
filing
takes
place
up
to
20
days
later,
and
under
the
earlier
law,
that
would
not
have
worked,
because
you
had
to
do
it
within
10
days.
so
i
thought
the
point
of
this
20-day
period
was
in
respect
to
those
23
states,
to
make
certain
that
their
perfection
laws
applied
and
that
a
secured
interest
that
corresponded
to
and
was
consistent
within
those
23
states
would
trump
the
trustee's
effort
to
get
the
property
back.
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
i
don't
want
to
hammer
the
point
too
hard,
but
i
take
it
you
are
conceding
that
nothing
of
any
practical
significance
was
accomplished
when
congress
amended
the
law
to
add
the
20-day
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
as
long
as
the
date
stamp
at
the
office
that
you
send
it
to,
that's
what's
going
to
prevail,
whether
it
gets
indexed
properly
or
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that...
that's
what
you--
