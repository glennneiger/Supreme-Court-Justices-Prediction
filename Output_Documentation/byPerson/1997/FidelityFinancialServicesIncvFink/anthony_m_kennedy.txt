justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
that
because
of
the
definition
of
perfected?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
assuming
justice
ginsburg's
state
with
10
days,
if
it's
15
days,
it
simply
can't
be
perfected
under
state
law.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
is
that
the
argument?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
it
doesn't
do
that,
then
it's
not
perfected
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
adopt
your
position,
are
there
going
to
be
problems
in
some
states
where
the
motor
vehicles
registration
period
is
just
slow
because
of
the
way
the
state
officials
work?
i
mean,
are
there
some
states
where
you
just
can't
do
this
within
20
days?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
if
you
do
everything
right,
are
there
not
some
states
where
they
take
longer
than
20
days
to
validate
the
lien?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
creditor,
generally
the
seller
in
these
cases,
what
remedy
does
he
have,
simply
not
to
transfer
possession
of
the
property
until
the
paperwork
is
completed?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
they
don't
have
any
protection,
then.
