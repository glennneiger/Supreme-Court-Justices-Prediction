justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
happens
in
a
state
like
massachusetts,
as
i
understand
it,
that
has
a
shorter
limit?
the
period
becomes
whatever
is
the
longer
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
state,
or
the
federal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
just
imagine
a
state...
your
state
has
a
30-day
provision.
let's
say
another
one
says
you've
got
to
do
it
within
10
days
or
it
doesn't
relate
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
happens
under
such
a
statute?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
the
longer...
it's
whichever
gives
you
more
time,
the
state
or
the
feds.
that's
your
position,
essentially.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
could
still
be--
--no,
but
it
is
perfected.
it
just
doesn't
relate
back.
you
can
perfect
between
11
and
20,
but
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
to
amplify
on
your
answer
to
justice
breyer,
because
it
was
my
understanding
that
congress
was
responding
to
what
the
majority
of
the
states
were
doing.
that
is,
they
had
a
period
longer
than
10
days.
they
had
a
20-day
period,
and
it
related
back.
now,
justice
breyer
recited
something
from
a
friend
of
the
court
brief
that
apparently
said
that
most
states
don't
have
a
relation-back,
or
over
20
states
don't
have
any
relation-back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
just...
is
it
true
or
not
that
some
20-odd
states
have
no
relation-back
period?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
means
that
the
creditor
would
prevail
over
any
intervening
creditor
who
tried
to
levy
on
the
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well--
--so
that
is
in
effect
a
relation-back.
is
there
a
difference
in
your
view,
mr.
gaughan,
between
what
you
describe
as
the
grace
period
in
the
uniform
commercial
code
and
a
provision
specifically
saying
there's
a
relation-back?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
are
no...
in
function,
they're
identical.
that
is,
they
stop
any
other
creditor
from
getting
in
front.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
--my
understanding
of
the
old
bankruptcy
act
was
that
the
shorter
time...
it
was
that
the
state
law
could
shorten
the
federal
period
but
never
extend
it,
and
now
you're
arguing
that
it
works
just
in
reverse,
that
the
state
law
can
extend
it
but
not
shorten
it,
if
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
why...
why
would
congress
have
made
that
expansion
from
10
to
20
if
congress
didn't
think
that
they
needed
to
do
that
in
order
to
have
the
states
that
had
the
20-day
period,
to
have
that
effected?
congress
must
have
thought
that
otherwise
it
was
going
to
be,
for
bankruptcy
code
purposes,
only
10
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
in
a
state
like
massachusetts,
that
has
a
shorter
period,
as
long
as
all
the
necessary
steps
to
perfect
were
taken
within
20
days
under
your
reading
of
the
code,
the
security
interest
would
be
permissible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
circuit
hasn't
had
a
chance
to
reconsider
since
the
enlargement
of
the
period
from
10
days
to
20
days.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
colloquy
may
be
a
weak
read
to
go
on,
but
it
didn't
seem
to
me
to
be
ambiguous.
you
suggested
it
was
ambiguous.
i
thought
those
two
senators
said
flat
out
that
they
meant
to
adopt
the
tenth
and
eleventh
circuit
position.
now,
nobody
voted
on
that
colloquy,
but
in
what
way
is
it
ambiguous?
maybe
we
could
ask
the
law
firm
that
drafted
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
there
a
statement...
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this,
but
i
remembered
a
statement
in
which--
--sasser
says...
sasser
cites
the
two
cases,
and
say
i
would
note
for
the
chairman
that
in
re
busenlehner,
in
re
hesser,
and
in
re
howard
came
to
these
conclusions,
and
my
purpose
in
this
discussion
is
to
establish
that
these
court
decisions
are
consistent
with
the
federal
bankruptcy
laws,
and
the
chairman,
mr.
heflin,
says,
i
would
say
to
my
colleague
that
it
is
appropriate
at
this
time
for
the
senate
to
state
its
intent
to
confirm
the
interpretations
of
these
circuits.
unless
you
think
he
was
inviting
the
senate
to
adopt
such
a...
an
intent,
which
it
did
not
do.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
practically
isn't
that
unlikely?
i
mean,
most
states
have
come
to
the
20-day
period.
we
just
have
how
many
with
30
days,
and
one
with
60,
so
most
of
them...
congress
tried
to
do
what
most
states
did,
right--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--in
setting
the
20-day
period.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
couldn't
one
look
at
that
as
congress
trying
to
stay
in
line
with
the
states
and
say,
in
case
of
a
state
that
doesn't
say
anything,
we'll
pick
the
state
that
most
states...
the
time
that
most
states
allow,
20
days,
but
we're
not
ruling
out
states
that
have
a
longer
period.
what...
why
isn't
that
a
proper
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
they
don't
need
to,
but
why
can't
one
read
these...
the
statute
putting
the
relation-back
provision
together
with
the
provision
about
the
lienholder's
interest
being
perfected
and
come
up
with,
well,
congress
meant
at
least
20
days
but
more
if
a
state
allowed
it?
