then
i
don't--
--but
you
can't
perfect
it
within
20
days.
you
can't
perfect
it
under
state
law
between
11
and
20
days,
so
the
shorter
period
would
de
facto
govern,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
perfected
within
20
days,
but
in
massachusetts
on
the
hypothesis
it
cannot
be
perfected
after
the
tenth
day.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
understand
that,
but
this
is
an
important
point,
and
it's
a
point
that
helps
you,
by
the
way,
because
if
it
is
correct
that
the
massachusetts
10-day
provision
would
supersede
the
20-day,
you
have
available
the
argument
that
this
statute
cannot
possibly
provide
a
uniform
period
anyway
because
it's
conceded
that
state
law
can
shorten
it,
and
we're
only
arguing
about
whether
state
law
can
lengthen
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
state
law
we're
talking
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
you
don't
have
that
argument.
you're
right.
may
i
ask,
mr.
gaughan,
is
the
provision...
see,
this
is
missouri,
isn't
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
i
think
that
what
the
u.c.c.
does
is
indistinguishable
from
a
relation-back
provision,
then
the
number
of
states
that
have
such
a
relation-back
provision
is
not
just
seven,
but
49,
i
assume,
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
beyond...
i
see.
i
see.
so
even
if
i
consider
all
the
u.c.c.
states
to
be
relation-back
states,
you're
saying
all
of
those
except
seven
have
a
20-day
grace
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
20
days
or
less.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
go
through
that
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
they
have
adopted
it?
how
could
they
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
depends
on
state
law.
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
the
stamping
date
is
the
date
of
perfection.
is
the
stamping
date
when
it's
received
the
date
of
perfection?
i
don't
know.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
thought
most
state
laws
would
make
the
date
of
perfection
at
least
the
date
when
there's
some
public
ability
to
know
of
the
existence
of
the
lien.
i...
at
least
it
works
that
way
under
the
u.c.c.,
and
just
because
the
relevant
agency...
well,
i
don't
know.
it
seems
strange
to
me.
may
i
go
back
for
a
minute,
mr.
fink,
to
the
legislative
history
that's
quoted
at
pages
24
and
25
of
the
blue
brief.
was
senator
heflin
the
chairman
of
the
committee
that...
and
also
was
he
the
floor
manager
of
the
bill,
just
out
of
curio...
do
you
know?
