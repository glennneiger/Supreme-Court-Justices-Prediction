mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
yes,
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
an
interpretation
of
the
preference
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
found
at
11
u.s.c.
section
547.
that
is
on
pages
1
through
5
of
petitioner's
brief.
the
issue
in
a
nutshell
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner,
fidelity
financial
services,
timely
perfected
its
lien
so
as
to
qualify
for
the
enabling
loan
exception
provided
in
547(c)(3).
it
is
undisputed
that
fidelity
satisfied
all
the
requirements
of
11
u.s.c.
section
547
(c)(3),
subsection
(a).
the
only
other
requirement
is
set
forth
in
subsection
(b).
that
states
that
the
security
interest
must
be
perfected
on
or
before
20
days
after
the
debtor
receives
possession
of
such
property,
meaning
the
financed
property.
when
a
transfer
is
perfected
is
defined
by
the
bankruptcy
code
at
section
547(e)(1)(b).
that
states
that
a
transfer
of
an
interest
in
property
other
than
real
property
is
perfected
when
a
creditor
on
a
simple
contract
cannot
obtain
a
judicial
lien
which
is
superior
to
the
interest
of
the
transferee.
that
determination
must
in
turn
be
made
by
reference
to
state
law,
in
this
case
missouri
state
law.
missouri
has
a
statute...
it's
been
on
the
books
since
1965.
it's
found
at
301.600
revised
statutes
of
missouri.
it
states
that
a
lien
on
a
motor
vehicle
or
a
trailer
is
perfected
as
of
the
time
of
its
creation
if
certain
steps
are
taken
within
30
days.
it
is
undisputed
that
fidelity
satisfied
all
of
the
requirements
of
this
state
statute
within
21
days
at
the
earliest,
26
days
at
the
latest.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
the
physical
act
of
perfecting
the
lien
occurred
outside
of
the
20-day
grace
period
established
in
547(c)(3).
however,
under
missouri
state
law...
that
is
correct.
under
missouri
state
law,
if
the
lien
is
perfected
within
30
days
it
is
deemed
perfected
as
of
the
time
of
its
creation.
therefore,
under
those
circumstances
there
would
be
no
transfer
for
or
on
account
of
an
antecedent
debt
under
section
547(b)(2),
or,
alternatively,
the
creditor
could
raise
the
enabling
loan
shield
under
547(c)(3).
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
of
course,
congress
also
included
the
547(e)(1)(b)
section,
which
incorporates
state
law,
in
defining
when
a
transfer
is
perfected,
and
for
preference
purposes,
of
course,
when
a
transfer
occurs
is
when
it
is
perfected,
when
it's
made,
and
that
incorporates
state
law,
so
state
law
is
implicit
in
that
consideration.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
i
agree
that
in
effect
there
would
not
necessarily
be
an
end
point.
however,
up
to
this
point,
to
my
knowledge
only
60
days
is
the
longest
limit
that
has
been
established,
in
west
virginia
and
i
think
in
new
mexico
for
recreational
vehicles.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
justice--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--justice
ginsburg,
i'm
sorry,
but
i'm
not
aware
of
that
provision
in
the
massachusetts
law.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
under
the
current
interpretations
of
the
code,
if
the
lien
is
perfected
within
20
days
the
federal
law
controls.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
that
is
the
position
that
we
take.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--of
course,
we're
referring
to
the
missouri
statute,
which
includes
a
provision
that
deems
the
perfection
to
relate
back
to
day
1.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
it
back-dates
the
perfection.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
true.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
if
justice
scalia
says
it's
right,
it
must
be
right.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
my
understanding
of
the
current
court
interpretations
are
that
if
the
state's
provision
is
less
than
10
days,
they
still
allow
the
20-day
grace
period.
we
will
take
the
position
that
state
law
controls.
whatever
state
law
says--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
what
the
state
statutes
at
issue--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--well,
the
argument,
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
is
that
under
state
law
there
is
a
period
of
time
within
which
a
creditor
can
perfect
its
lien,
and
if
it
performs
the
required,
stated
requirements,
then
the
lien
is
deemed
perfected
as
of
day
1,
the
date
that
the
loan
was--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
certainly,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--certainly,
justice
scalia--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--if
we
go
beyond...
if
it
could
be
perfected
3
months
down
the
road--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--it's
perfected
3
months
down
the
road.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
yes.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
justice
stevens,
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
at
least
20
states
that
have
that
provision
in
their
state
statutes.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
in
seven
of
those
states
the
perfection-back
period
is
more
than
20
days.
it's
either
21
days,
30
days,
60
days.
there
are
seven
states
that
have
those
provisions.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
of
course,
a
vehicle
loan
is
a
different
animal
than
a
regular
secured
transaction.
in
a
regular,
secured
transaction
the
security
agreement,
the
note,
the
financing
statement
is
all
executed
at
the
same
time.
therefore,
there
is
no
delay.
it's
signed
upon
consummation
of
the
loan
transaction.
on
a
vehicle
loan,
particularly
with
this
type
of
transaction
that
involves
dealer
paper,
where
the
buyer
goes
to
the
dealership,
they
don't
ask
who's
going
to
make
the
loan.
they
just
ask
to
buy
the
car,
and
the
dealer
arranges
the
financing,
and
the
package
is
sent
on
to
a
lender,
so
there
is
inherent
delay
built
into
that
system
from
the
outset.
so
the
20-day
might
make
sense,
i
suppose,
in
a
commercial
transaction
or
a
regular
consumer
goods-type
transaction,
where
you
have
a
financing
statement
that
might
need
to
be
filed,
but--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
the
20-day
period,
of
course,
establishes
when
the
security
interest
must
be
perfected.
then
in
the
same
section
the
statute
says
it's
perfected
when
state
law
says
it's
perfected,
so
if
it's
perfected
within
state
law,
within
that
20-day
period,
it's
perfected
under
the
statute.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
i
would
say
that
the
20-day
requirement
established
by
congress
simply
requires
that
the
security
interest
be
perfected
within
20
days.
if
state
law
in
turn
says
that
the
transaction
is
deemed
perfected
as
of
day
1,
it's
still
perfected
within
that
20-day
period.
it's
just
on
day
1
of
the
period.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
and
i
would
concede
that.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
of
course,
the
congressional
statement
i
think
was
that
it
was
amended
to
bring
the--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
and,
of
course,
under
the
missouri
scheme,
then,
if
the
lien
is
perfected
within
the
30-day
period,
the
lien
relates
back
to
day
1.
if
that
is
the
case,
there
is
no
transfer
on
account
of
an
antecedent
debt,
or
the
enabling
loan
provision
would
certainly
apply.
two
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
followed
this
line
of
reasoning,
in
re
hesser
out
of
the
tenth
circuit,
in
re
busenlehner
out
of
the
eleventh
circuit.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
i
think
it
all
began
under
the
old
act.
of
course,
back
then
the
trustee
had
to
prove
that
the
creditor
had
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
the
debtor
was
insolvent,
and
we
didn't
have
the
90-day
presumption
period.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
the
20-odd
states,
it's
true
that
they
don't
have
a
specific
relation-back
period
that
says
it's
back-dated
to
day
1.
however,
there's
a
grace
period
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
in
that
state
that
would
apply,
under
for
purchase
money
security--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
it's
a
very
minute
difference,
of
course,
because
one
simply
says
that
there
is
a
grace
period
within
which
if
certain
steps
are
taken
the
lien
is
perfected.
the
other
one
says
that
if
certain
steps
are
taken
the
perfection
is
back-dated
to
day
1.
they
certainly
accomplish
the
same
objective.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
that
is
correct.
they
would
stop
any
intervening
lead
creditor
from
taking
priority.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
and
i
would
agree,
under
section
60,
i
believe
it
was,
of
the
old
act
a
creditor
had
21
days
within
which
to
perfect
its
lien
unless
the
short...
or
the
state
period
was
shorter.
however,
in
1978,
when
the
bankruptcy
code
was
overhauled,
i
believe
it
was
recommended
by
the
national
bankruptcy
commission
that
that
21-day
period
be
left
intact
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
it
was
purchase
money
or
not,
without
regard
to
whether
or
not
states
had
longer
or
shorter
periods,
and
congress
without
comment
simply
changed
it
to
10
days.
of
course,
they
also
put
in
the
90-day
presumption
of
solvency,
et
cetera,
so
there
was
an
overhaul
of
the
preference
provisions,
but
without
comment
congress
said,
at
least
in
1978,
that
the
security
interest
had
to
be
perfected
within
10
days
of
attachment,
and
then
in
the
'84
amendments
they
stated
that
it
had
to
be
perfected
within
10
days
of
the
debtor
receiving
possession
of
the
property.
then,
finally,
in
the
1994
amendments
congress
stated
that
the
lien
had
to
be
perfected
within
20
days
of
the
debtor
receiving
possession
of
the
property,
so
it's
hard
to
tell
by
looking
at
the
old
act
what
significance
that
had
on
the
current
statute.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
i
believe
that
the
uniform
commercial
code
model
is
still
10
days,
although
i
understand
that's
being
revised.
most
states
have
adopted,
i
believe,
a
20-day
period
of
time,
but
i
think
the
model...
it
was
the
1972
model
was
what
was
used
when
congress
revamped
the
bankruptcy
code
in
'78.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
correct,
but
the
seven
was
the
number
of
states
that
had
a
period
of
time
beyond
20
days,
greater
than
the
20-day
period,
so
we
have
one
with
21
days,
i
think
there's
four
with
30--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--that--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--i
would
assume
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
i
think
certainly
when
the
statute
was
reenacted
in
'78--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--it
was
10
days.
i
think
most
have
gone
to
20
days
now,
but
i
would
not...
i
don't
know
the
number
of
states
that
have
done
so.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
that
is
true,
but
of
course,
back
when
the
code
was
reenacted
in
'78,
states
all
utilized
the
'72
model,
which
was
10
days,
so
it's
certainly
arguable
that
congress
intended
to
make
the
10-day
period
harmonious
with
state
law.
it
was
at
that
time,
at
least.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
the
amendment,
of
course...
the
'94
amendment,
is
that
what
you're
referring
to?
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
there
have
been
none
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
in--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--well,
the
two
courts
of
appeals
that
we
relied
on
and
are
cited
in
our
briefs,
the
eleventh
and
tenth
circuit
opinions,
note
that
in
'78
the
code
was
overhauled
and
the
intention
with
respect
to
the
preference
provisions
was
to
bring
them
more
into
conformity
with
commercial
law
and
commercial
practices.
presumably,
then,
state
law
practices
were
to
be
adopted,
at
least
under
that
general
statement.
the
fact
that
congress
then
changed
it
to
10
days
from
possession
in
'84
without
comment
doesn't
tell
us
anything.
the
only
snippet,
of
course,
is
in
the
'94
amendments,
where
they
state
that
they
wanted
to
bring
it
more
into
conformity
with
most
states'
practices
by
increasing
it
to
20
days.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
concede
that.
of
course,
vehicle
perfection
loans
are
not
routine
loans
they
would
be
outside
the
normal
considerations
for
this
kind
of
transaction,
because
in
a
normal
loan...
and
in
fact
i
think
collier
on
bankruptcy
noted
that
after
the
1994
amendments,
that's
the
end
of
the
issue.
if
you
file
your
financing
statement
within
20
days,
you're
perfected.
if
not,
you're
not.
but
we're
not
talking
about
filing
financing
statements.
under
the
uniform
commercial
code,
perfection
of
liens
on
motor
vehicles
is
handled
under
separate
state
vehicle
perfection
statutes.
each
state
has
its
own
requirements.
in
the
eleventh
circuit
decision
of
busenlehner,
it
had
a
statute
much
like
the
missouri
statute,
the
one
we
refer
to
as
a
relation-back
statute,
and
that
was
a
georgia
state
law
that
allowed
the
lien
to
be
deemed
perfected
as
of
the
day
of
creation
if
certain
steps
were
taken
within
20
days.
in
that
case,
the
loan
was
obtained
on
march
31
of
1988,
the
physical
act
of
perfecting
the
lien
occurred
on
march...
or
april
13
of
1988,
and
a
bankruptcy
was
filed
on
april
26.
the
court
found,
of
course,
that
although
it
was
beyond
the
10-day
period
established
in
547(c)(3)
subsection
(b),
the...
(e)(1)(b)
of
the
bankruptcy
code
incorporates
state
law,
and
under
georgia
state
law
the
lien
was
perfected
as
of
the
day
of
its
creation.
therefore,
there
was
no...
actually,
they
ruled
that
therefore
they
were
entitled
to
the
enabling
loan
exception,
547(c)(3).
the
other
case,
the
hesser
case,
came
out
of
oklahoma.
they
had
a
15-day
period
of
time
within
which
to
perfect,
and
in
that
case
i
believe
the
loan
originated
on
april
16
of
1990
and
the
physical
act
of
perfection
occurred
on
ap...
or
may
1,
1990,
and
then
18
days
later
the
debtor
filed
bankruptcy.
that
was
beyond
the
10-day
grace
period,
but
nonetheless,
by
interpreting
oklahoma
law,
the
court
noted
that
under
state
law
it
was
perfected
as
of
day
1.
therefore,
that
court
held
there
was
no
transfer
for
or
on
account
of
an
antecedent
debt
under
547(b)(2),
and
that
they
could
claim
the
enabling
loan
exception
under
547(c)(3).
if
we
were
to
adopt
further
reasoning
in
this
case,
we
could
also
say
the
transfer
occurred
outside
the
preference
period
under
547(b)(4),
because
it
would
have
been
93
days
before
the
case
was
filed.
both
of
those
circuit
court
opinions,
as
i
previously
indicated,
quoted
the
legislative
history,
and
the
intention
was
to
bring
the
preference
provisions
more
into
conformity
with
commercial
practices
in
the
uniform
commercial
code,
and
therefore
creditors
were
encouraged
to
look
to
state
law
in
order
to
perfect
their
liens.
there
wasn't
a
lot
of
discussion
in
either
of
those
cases.
the
language
was
accepted
on
its
face.
you
perfect
under
(e)(1)(b)
by
utilizing
state
law.
in
both
cases,
the
lien
was
perfected
within
state
law
ramifications.
therefore
it
related
back
to
day
1.
it
was
perfected
under
the
bankruptcy
code
then
under
547(c)(3)
subsection
(b).
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
right.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
it
accomplishes
the
same
objective.
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
i
would
agree
with
that.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
absolutely,
but
under
state
law,
of
course,
whether
it's
20
days
or
30
days--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--vis-a-vis
an
inter-liening--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--a
lien
creditor
on
a--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--correct.
that
is
correct.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
well,
that's
true.
of
course,
the
old
act
was
amended
five
or
six
times,
section
60,
and
there
was
amendment
upon
amendment
that
didn't
accomplish
any
objective
either.
when
the
code
was
amended
in
1984
to
make
it
10
days
from
date
of
possession,
there
was
simply
no
comment
on
why
congress
did
it.
the
only...
the
20-day
legislative
history
comment
simply
states
that
it
was
done
in
order
to
bring
the
preference
provisions
more
into
conformity
with
most
states'
practices.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
a
few
points.
the
facts
in
this
particular
case,
the
loan
was
obtained
on
august
17,
1994,
and
the
loan
was
in
the
amount
of
14,300
dollars,
i
believe.
the
debtor
took
possession
of
the
car
in
this
case
the
same
day,
but
it
is
not
unusual
for
a
debtor
to
take
a
test
drive,
for
instance,
at
a
dealership,
to
take
a
car
home,
so
the
possession
could
start
before
the
loan
is
even
consummated.
in
this
case,
it
occurred
on
the
same
day.
the
paperwork
was
mailed
to
the
missouri
department
of
revenue
on
september
7.
however,
the
department
of
revenue's
record
showed
that
it
wasn't
validated
until
september
23,
which
was
more
than
30
days
after
the
transaction.
we
undertook
discovery,
and--
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
--i
understand.
mr.
michael
p.
gaughan
i
was
just
trying
to
point
out
that
there
is
an
inherent
delay
built
into
vehicle
perfections.
it's
not
like
signing
a
financing
statement.
with
the
financing
statement
there
is
no
notice
to
the
world
until
it's
recorded.
you
could
file
a
financing
statement
three
different
times
on
the
same
collateral,
but
with
a
car
there
is
a
title
that
actually
follows
that
particular
item
of
collateral,
so
it's
very
difficult
to
pledge
that
three
or
four
times
over.
the
notice,
there's
no
problem
with
notice
to
the
world
because
you
can't
falsify
that
information.
that's
all
i
have.
if
there's
any
other
questions--
