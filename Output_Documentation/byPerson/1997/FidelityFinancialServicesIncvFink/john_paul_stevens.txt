justice
john
paul
stevens
in
missouri,
that
deems
the
lien
perfected
as
of
the
date
of
the
initial
transaction,
is
that
typical
of
state
laws?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
all
of
those
states,
the
20-day
federal
period
has
no
meaning?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
congress
need
the
20-day
provision
at
all
under
your
reading?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
don't
understand
your
answer,
because
you're
saying
there's
one
category
of
transactions
which
typically
are
performed
immediately.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there's
really
no
delay.
there's
a
second
category
of
transactions,
because
of
the
delay
you
need
a
relation-back
period.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
in
that
category,
if
the
state
law
always
controls,
the
20-day
federal
period
doesn't
serve
any
function
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other,
just
informative
question...
before
we
granted
cert,
you
pointed
out
there
was
a
conflict,
with
two
courts
that
joined
your
view
of
the
reading.
they
had
decided
when
the
10-day
provision
was
in
effect,
as
i
remember.
justice
john
paul
stevens
hesser
and
the
other
case.
have
there
been
any
cases
since
the
amendment
that
have
adopted
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah.
justice
john
paul
stevens
thank
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
mr.
fink,
has
this
issue
arisen
in
any
case
in
the
ninth
or
tenth
circuit
since
the
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
just
in
the
circuit.
do
those
circuits
continue
to
follow
the
same
rule,
contrary
to
your
position,
that
they
followed
before
the
1994--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
don't
know...
no
cases
you
know
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
fink--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
ask
one
question?
i'm
just
kind
of
curious.
the
vehicle
here
is
worth
about
14,000
dollars,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
lien
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
[dollars]
3,000?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
and
that's
what's
at
issue.
the
question
is
whether
the
creditors
get
that
money
or
the
secured
credit...
the
general
creditors
or
the
secured
creditors?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
it's
really
not
relevant.
i'm
just
curious.
how
big
is
the
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
and
that's
the
estate
that's
financing
this
litigation,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
a
little
worried
about
your
posture
here,
frankly.
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
kind
of
a
test
case,
in
other
words.
