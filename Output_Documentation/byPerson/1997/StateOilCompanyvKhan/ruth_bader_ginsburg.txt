mr.
baumgartner,
are
you
right
when
you
say
there's
no
evidence?
at
least
it
was
alleged
that
that
was
what
the
receiver
did,
wasn't
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
found
that
they
were
minimum
pricing
cases,
not
maximum
pricing
cases.
and
i
suppose
the
question
is,
a
genuine
maximum...
which
is
not
in
question
in
this
case...
no
one
is
asserting
that
this
was
a
minimum
price
in
disguise...
do
you
have
any
case
where
there
was
a
maximum
price,
not
a
disguised
minimum
price,
where
the
states
have
prosecuted?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
why
was
it...
dr.
miles
was
1911
and
albrecht
wasn't
until
the
sixties.
so
if
it
was
so
evident
that
minimum
and
maximum
are
the
same
and
they're
all
equally
bad,
why
did
it
take
from
1911,
till
what,
1968
for
that
light
to
go
on?
