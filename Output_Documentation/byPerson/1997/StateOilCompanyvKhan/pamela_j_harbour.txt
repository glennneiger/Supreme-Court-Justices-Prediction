ms.
pamela
j.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
for
several
decades,
the
35
state
attorneys
general
before
this
court
today
have
been
the
primary
enforcers
of
the
law
in
the
area
of
vertical
price-fixing.
our
experience,
and
the
realities
of
the
marketplace,
have
shown
us
that
the
labels
placed
on
these
agreements...
that
is
to
say,
maximum
vertical
price-fixing,
on
one
hand,
and
minimum
vertical
price-fixing
on
the
other...
are,
in
most
cases,
a
meaningless
distinction.
as
the
agencies
most
familiar
with
these
cases,
the
states
have
considerable
experience
with
price-raising
schemes
being
characterized
as
price-lowering
schemes.
and--
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
--your
honor,
there
are...
there
was
a
characterization
game
that
was
going
on
here.
the
targets
of
our
investigation
came
in
and
said
to
us,
we
are
actually
fixing
price
ceilings,
intending
to
lower
prices.
but,
in
fact,
after
we
investigated,
we
found
that
those
were
not
price
ceilings.
in
fact,
they
were
intended
to
raise
prices
rather
than
lower
them.
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
as
i
said,
there
are
elements
of
maximum
price-fixing
in
the
cases
that
we
brought.
the
states
claim
that
they're
price-fixing--
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
--the
minolta
case.
it
was
a
$640,000
settlement
that
was
returned
to
consumers.
panasonic
involved
a
$16
million
settlement.
and
in
these
two
cases,
as
well
as
mitsubishi,
your
honor,
the
defendants
contended
that
they
were
actually
trying
to
lower
prices
for
consumers.
but,
in
fact,
when
we
investigated,
we
found
that
they
were
in
fact
raising
those
prices.
there
was
a
characterization
they
were
appealing
to
our
prosecutory--
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
--understood,
your
honor.
no,
your
honor.
but
retailer
market
power
is
very
rare
in
these
cases--
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
--your
honor,
basically,
the
argument
being
advanced
today
by
the
petitioners
is
that
manufacturers,
like
state
oil,
should
be
free
to
restrain
the
exercise
of
monopoly
power
by
their
dealers
who
have
been
granted
exclusive
territories.
well,
first
of
all,
khan
had
no
exclusive
territory.
there
is
nothing
in
this
record
that
points
to
that.
and,
second
of
all,
nothing
in
this
record
suggests
that
khan
had
monopoly
power
whatsoever.
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
the
rule
of
reason
is
not
the
rule
for
a
price-fixing
case
or
any
agreement
on
price.
in
fact,
as
this
court
has
held
in
maricopa,
the
anti-competitive
potential
inherent
in
all
price-fixing
cases
justify
their
facial
invalidation
even
when
pro-competitive
justifications
are
offered
for
some.
but,
in
this
case,
your
honor,
it
is
the
states'
position
that
the
argument
posited
by
the
petitioners
is
illogical.
and
allow
me
to
illustrate.
the
petitioners
have
hypothesized
a
dealer
with
market
power
in
an
exclusive
territory.
when
a
dealer
has
monopoly
power,
by
definition,
there
is
no
effective
interbrand
competition;
and,
therefore,
there
is
no
justification
for
granting
the
exclusive
territory.
under
the
sylvania
decision,
sylvania
held
that
restraints
on
intrabrand
competition...
namely,
the
exclusive
territory...
will
only
be
tolerated
when
they
stimulate
interbrand
competition.
but
here,
this...
this
dealer,
this
hypothetical
monopoly
power
that
this
dealer
has,
there
is
no
effective
interbrand
competition.
therefore,
there
is
no
justification
for
granting
the
exclusive
territory;
and
further,
there
is
no
justification
for
imposing
the
price
ceiling
to
restrain
the
monopoly
power
that
was
unreasonably
granted
to
the
dealer
in
the
first
place.
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
as...
as
the
holding--
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
--intrabrand
competition...
restraints
on
intrabrand
competition
will
only
be
tolerated
when
they
stimulated
interbrand
competition.
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
when...
i'm
talking
about
a...
a
monopolist.
and
when
there
is
a
monopolist
there,
that
means
there
is
no
inter
or
intrabrand
competition.
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
your
honor,
if...
if
i
have
mischaracterized
that,
forgive
me.
but
i...
i
do
know
that,
in
sylvania,
this
court
said
that
in
order
to...
to
restrain
intrabrand
competition,
there
must
be
effective
interbrand
competition.
and
the
states
do
not
feel
that
that
has
been
posited
here.
but
we
do
believe
that
a
great
deal
is
at
stake
in
this
case,
your
honor...
more
than
the
29-year-old
rule
in
the
albrecht
decision.
the
clear
and
straightforward
per
se
rule
against
maximum
price-fixing,
which
has
served
this
nation
well
for
most
of
this
century,
is
at
risk.
albrecht
was
merely
a
reaffirmation
of
dr.
miles,
sucony-vacuum
oil,
parke
davis
and
many
other
precedents
in
a
consistent
line
of
cases,
which
all
stand
for
the
same
proposition...
that
price-fixing
is
price-fixing,
whether
it
is
vertical
or
horizontal--
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
--actually,
it
didn't,
your
honor.
in
1911,
dr.
miles
equated
horizontal
and...
and
vertical
price-fixing.
and...
and,
basically,
they
said
that
it
produced
market
effects
that
were
functionally
the
same.
but,
then,
in
the
sucony-vacuum
oil
decision,
in
1940,
this
court
formulated
the
classic
definition
of
a
price-fixing
agreement...
any
agreement
that
fixes,
raises,
lowers,
maintains,
or
stabilizes
prices.
in
that
agreement,
maximum
and
minimum
price-fixing
was
equated.
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
yes.
in
the
states'
opinion,
price
ceilings
almost
always
harm
consumers.
and
they
almost
always
harm
consumers
because
they
can
disguise
a
minimum
price,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
albrecht
and
late
in
maricopa,
or
they
could
be
a
de
facto
minimum.
and
also
they
can
fa...
facilitate
collusion.
and
as
this
court
pointed
out
in--
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
well,
in
fact,
that
is--
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
--i
believe
that
that
suggestion
by
your
honor
is
an
alternative
that
can
be
used
instead
of
the
price
ceiling.
price
ceilings
are
almost
always
anti-competitive.
and
there
are
alternatives
that
are
less
pernicious
to
competition,
such
as
suggested
retail
pricing.
ms.
pamela
j.
harbour
you're
welcome.
