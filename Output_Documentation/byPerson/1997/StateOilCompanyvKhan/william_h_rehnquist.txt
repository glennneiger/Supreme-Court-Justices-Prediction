we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
96-871,
state
oil
company
v.
barkat
u.
khan
and

&
associates.
mr.
baumgartner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
baumgartner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can't
have
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
waiters?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klein,
what
about
the
principle
of
stare
decisis
here?
we're
dealing
with
a
statutory
question,
not
a
constitutional
question.
and,
customarily,
it
takes
a
fairly
strong
case
to
get
us
to
overrule
a
previous
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
of...
of
what
use
is
congressional
reaction
if
it
doesn't
become
a
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
mr.
divincenzo.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
surely...
surely
the
effect
was
precisely
the
same.
if
you
tell
a
dealer
that
you
can
charge
whatever
you
want,
but
everything
over
a
certain
amount
that
you
take
in
goes
to
me,
he's
not
going
to
do
that?
you
don't
really
think
they
thought
mr.
khan
was
that
stupid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
3.25
limit
did
not
apply
to
premium?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
grades...
all
grades
of
gas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
see.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
free
market
forces
are
ordinarily
reflected
in
contracts,
which
your
client
signed
with
state
oil.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
divincenzo.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
ms.
harbour,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
harbour.
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
baumgartner,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
96-871,
state
oil
co.
against.
khan
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
