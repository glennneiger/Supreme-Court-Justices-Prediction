mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
current
antitrust
jurisprudence
relies
upon
interbrand
competition
to
guarantee
the
fundamental
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws:
the
protection
and
preservation
of
competition.
what
i
find
interesting
in
this
case
is
that
although
cloaking
themselves
as
champions
of
competition,
their
position...
the
government
and
state
oil's
position...
really
expresses
a
deep-seated
distrust
of
interbrand
competition.
look
at
what
they
tell
you.
they
tell
you
that
we
need
to
have
the
manufacturers
and
suppliers,
the
upstream
suppliers,
have
power
to
set
prices,
because
interbrand
competition,
which
affects
and
controls
retailers'
actions
as
well,
isn't
going
to
work.
we
have
to
be
afraid
of
the
possibility
of
retailers
having
market
power.
what
happened
to
the
concept
of
interbrand
competition,
which
they
espouse?
if
interbrand
competition
exists
in
a
marketplace,
why
not
trust
interbrand
competition
to
keep
the
prices
of
the
retailers
at
the
level
the
competition
would
in
fact
dictate?
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
in
30
years,
since
albrecht
was
adopted,
what
i'm
looking
for
and
i
don't
see
in
this
record
or
in
the
literature
is
any
breakdown
of
interbrand
competition
controlling
retailers.
as
this
court
itself
pointed
out
in
the...
the
sharp
case,
it
is
rare,
indeed,
that
you're
going
to
find
a
retailer
that
has
market
power
to
be
able
to
dictate
price.
and,
indeed,
the
concept
of
gte/sylvania
was
that
you
don't
have
to
really
worry
about
exclusive
territories,
because
they
protect
intrabrand
competition,
because
you
still
have
the
specter
of
interbrand
competition
out
there
to
control
these
retailers,
even
though
they
now
have
exclusive
territories.
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
the
best
way
to
approach
the
potential
problem
of
a
market
power
in
a
retailer
is
under
the
current
jur...
jurisprudence.
and
that
has
two
very
distinct
elements.
the
first
is
albrecht,
which
is
the
per
se
application.
it
says
that
a
violation
of
section
1
occurs
when
there
is
a
vertical
maximum
resale
price
maintenance
agreement...
price-fixing
at
that
level.
but
there's
a
second
element.
and
that
is
the
arco
case.
and
the
arco
case
says
that
in
order
for
a
private
plaintiff
to
have
an
antitrust
cause
of
action,
that
private
plaintiff
has
to
establish
an
antitrust
injury.
and
it
is
an
injury
which
flows
from
the
core
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
what
is
the
core
of
the
antitrust
laws,
as
this
court
has
come
to
define
it?
interbrand
competition.
so,
thus,
you
have
the
per
se
rule
in
its
maximum,
strident
position,
indeed--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--interbrand.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
again--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--no,
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
no,
what...
what
i'm
saying
is
that
in
a
situation...
the
best
way
of
dealing
with
that
market
power
is
to
use
the...
the
per
se
rule,
coupled
with
antitrust
injury.
it
would
require
a
plaintiff
to
demonstrate
that
there
was
an
injury
flowing
to
itself
from
the
interference
within
interbrand
competition.
and
that's
what
occurred
in
this
case.
here,
mr.
khan
ran
his
gas
station...
and
he
was
constrained
as
to
his
pricing
ability.
he
had
to
deal
with
a
margin
restraint,
which
is
a...
a
slightly
different
animal
than
a
pure
maximum
price-fixing
price.
it
says:
mr.
khan,
you
cannot
make
more
than
3
and
a
quarter
cents
per
gallon
of
gasoline.
now,
we
don't
care
if
you
charge
more
than
the
suggested
pump
price.
and...
except...
and
even
to
monopoly
levels...
but
we
get
those
monopoly
profits.
and
that's
state
oil's
position
here.
it's
clear
that
state
oil
wasn't
trying
to
restrain
mr.
khan's
ability
to
charge
monopoly
prices.
all
they
wanted
to
do
was
shift
the
profits
from
that
monopoly
pricing,
if
it
could
occur,
from
mr.
khan,
and
put
some--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--no,
i--
[laughter]
no,
i...
i...
i
cert...
i
certainly
agree.
but
i
think,
your
honors,
what
that
puts
an
end
to
is
the
argument
which
state
oil
makes,
that
what
they
were
trying
to
do
was
constrain,
in
reality,
mr.
khan's
pricing.
i
don't
think
that
that
was
what
was
involved
in
this
case
at
all.
the
intention
here
may
have
been
to
allocate
the
profit
margins,
but
it
certainly
wasn't
any
concern
over
mr.
khan's
ability
to
manipulate
or
charge
more
for
gasoline
than
interbrand
competition,
which
existed
in
this
marketplace,
would
allow
him
to
charge.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
the
consumer
was
harmed
here
because
the
price
which
was
in
fact
set,
the
mechanism...
the
restraining
mechanism...
the
margin
restraint,
affected
both
a
maximum
price
on
some
products
as
well
as
the
minimum
price
on
other
products.
indeed,
what
you
ended
up
here
is
the
manufacturer
set
a
single
price,
and
that
became
the
market
price.
because
it
not
only
eliminated
the
ability
of
the
supp...
of
the
dealer,
mr.
khan,
to
increase
price...
he...
well,
it
removed
any
incentive,
as
this
court
has
quite...
pointed...
has
just
pointed
out
to
me...
it
also
eliminated
his
incentive
to
decrease
prices.
because,
at
this
point,
a
3-and-a-quarter-cent
margin,
his
margins
were
so
close
to
cost
that
he
had
no
incentive
or
ability
to
lower
the
price.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
the
receiver
behaved
exactly
that
way
after
mr.
khan
was
out.
when
mr.
khan
left
the
station,
the
receiver
did
exactly
what
we
say
state
oil
constrained
them,
or
stopped
them,
from
doing.
it
lowered
the
price
on
regular
grades
of
gasoline.
and,
as
the
expert
points
out,
that
resulted
in
a
shift
of
the
volumes
from
premium
to
more
sales
of
regular
gasoline,
thereby
increasing
the
volume
of
sales.
and
the
same
token,
there
was
an--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--no.
i--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--your
honor,
with
all...
with...
based
on
the
record
we
have,
all
we
know
is
that
there
was
more
regular
gasoline
sold.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
no,
your
honor.
what--
[laughter]
--what
this
man
is
trying
to
do
is
run
a
business
where
he
has
margins
constrained
at
3
and
a
quarter
cents
per
gallon,
which
is
simply,
as
experience
proved
to
him,
not
enough
to
sustain
his
business.
so
what
he
attempts
to
do
at
that
point
is,
by
using
his
market
ability
to
read
the
market,
to
get
to
a
level
which
brings
him
more
volume
and
therefore
some
additional
gross
revenue--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--but,
at
the
same
token,
add
to
his
profit
by
charging
a...
what
the
market
allows
him
to
charge
as
a
competitive
price
on
another
grade
of
gasoline.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
the
incentive
that
any
dealer
has
is
to
stay
in
business,
your
honor.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
and
if
he...
if,
by
lowering
price,
he
cannot
make
enough
money
to
stay
in
business--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--your
honor,
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
and...
and
for
this
reason.
as
a
businessman
sitting
there,
he
must
decide
whether
in
fact
the
lowering
of
the
price
in
the
competitive
conditions
that
he
faces
will...
will
result
in
an
increase
in
volume
to
him,
and
bring
in
sufficient
additional
revenue
to
offset
the
decrease
in
price
that
he
has
in
fact
imposed.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
and
it
is
also
the--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--your
honor,
he
must
make
money.
but
it
would
also
be
the
case
of
someone
who
is
in
trouble
of
going
out
of
business
to
adopt
that
marketing
strategy
and
that
pricing
strategy.
because
if
that
person
is
then
faced
with
a
business
where
he
is
about
to
lose
his
$100,000
investment
in
his
gas
station,
he
has
got
to
do
something
to
increase
his
profitability.
he's
got
to
make
more
money.
so
at
that
point
he
says,
i
can
get
more
volume
and
thereby
increase
my
ancillary
sales,
drawing
in
additional
revenue.
but,
at
the
same
token,
that
is
a
tremendous
gamble,
and
one
which
he
may
say,
given
the
current
market
conditions,
he
could
not
achieve.
if
he
lowers
the
price
and
doesn't
increase
volume,
what
he's
done
is
signed
his
own
death
warrant.
but
in
the
circumstances
that
existed
here
because
of
the
pricing
decisions
imposed
upon
him
by
state
oil,
the
market
for
premium
gasoline,
the
interbrand
competition
on
premium
gasoline,
would
allow
him
to
make
more
money.
and
so,
as
a
result,
he
was
able...
would
be
able
to
shift
his
pricing,
to
lower
the
price
in
one
place,
to
increase
his
overall
volumes
and,
the
same
token,
to
increase
the
price
on
premium
gasolines,
overall
increasing
his
margins.
and--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--the
3.25
limit
applied
to
all
grades
of
gasoline.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
all
grades
of
gasoline.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
he
was
restricted
with
that
margin.
he
could
not
charge
another
price.
if
he
did,
it
went
to
state
oil.
if
he
dropped
below,
he
lost
money.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
that
would
certainly
be
rational
thinking
on
their
part.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
yes.
that
would
be
rational
thinking
on
his
part.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
the
argument
can
always
be
made
by
a
monopolist
with
market
power
that
they're...
what
they're
trying
to
do
is
shift
pricing
around
so
that,
at
one
point,
they
in
fact
lower
price.
i
don't
think
that
makes
a
monopolist...
you
know,
going
back
to
united
shoe
machinery,
this
court
was
faced
with
the
benevolent
monopolist.
you
can
always
posit
a
benevolent
monopolist,
but
that
still
was...
was
considered
illegal.
what
i
think
the
administrative
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
the
rest
of
the
antitrust
laws
aren't
abrogated
as
to
dealers.
the
antitrust
laws
would
apply
to
dealers
who
attempt
to
use
or
abuse
monopoly
power
that
they
have
acquired
in
a
definable
marketplace.
and
that...
that's
the
other
end
of
this
scenario.
you
have
on
one
end,
in
trying
to
judge
whether
you
should
change
the
per
se
rule
and
allow
vertical
maximum
price-fixing,
the
question
is:
is
it
really
necessary?
and
i
suggest
that
it's
not.
because
interbrand
competition
should
do,
in
all
cases
where
interbrand
competition
exists
and
is
not
distorted,
it
should
keep
the
prices
at
competitive
levels.
so
you
don't
need
to
have
this
artificial
restraint
or
power
given
to
manufacturers
where
interbrand
competition
can
work.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
the
answer,
your
honor,
is
that
in
the
given
conditions,
the
price
that
was
prevailing
in
the
marketplace
must
have
allowed
him
to
make
additional
margins.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
no,
i...
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect.
interbrand
competition
doesn't
always
drive
the
price
to
the
lowest
possible
level.
otherwise,
you'd
have
no
profitability.
competition
sets
a
price...
and
i
think
this
court
has
recognized--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--or...
or--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the...
the
difference
in
the
products...
there
are...
without
using
the...
the
term
"market"
in
the
technical
sense...
but
the
difference
in
the
competitive
market
for
premium
gasoline
would
allow
a
higher
margin.
and
a...
competition
within
that
market
would
have
allowed
the
dealers
to
make
more
than
3
and
a
quarter
cents
per
gallon.
the
receiver
experience,
at
least
3
and
8/10ths
cents
a
gallon
over
all
his
entire
product
margin.
on
the
other
hand,
because
of
the
difference
in
the
nature
of
competition,
it
may
be
that
premium
gasoline
buyers
don't
price
shop
as
much
as
regular
gasoline
purchasers,
but
that
the
general
circumstance
concerning
regular
gasoline
is
that
the
margins...
the
competitive
market
allows
less
margin
and
requires
lower
prices.
and
what
state
oil
did
was
it
ignored
the
competitive
circumstances,
ignored
these
differences
between
these
products,
and
set
a
single
price.
and
that
put
him--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--you...
you
might
receive
some
additional--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--well,
not
necessarily
stupid;
less
price
elastic.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
demand
being,
in
that
market,
a
little
different,
the
elasticities
of
demand
being
different.
but
under
those
circumstances,
what
you
end
up
happening
is...
what
ends
up
happening
is
that
you
have
state
oil
saying
to
this
court:
give
us
the
power
to
give...
put
our
judgment
in
place
of
free
market
forces.
and...
and
that
is
a
very
serious
threat
to
competition,
which
is
the
purpose
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
there
was
a
contract
that
was...
was
signed
with
state
oil,
in
which
he
agreed...
that's
how
we
actually
get
in...
under
section
1
here,
your
honor.
there
was
an
agreement
which
constrained
his
ability
to
price,
to
3
and
a
quarter
cents.
there
is...
the
flip
side
of
that,
however,
is
that
what
is
not
set
is
the
pump
price.
there
is
no
contractual
requirement
that
a
particular
pump
price
be
set.
so
state
oil
had
the
right
to
set
a
pump
price,
and
that
pump
price
may
or
may
not
reflect
conditions
in
competition
in
that
particular
marketplace.
and
if
state
oil
guessed
wrong,
then
you
have
the
threat
of
anti-competitive
effects.
and
if
state
oil,
as
it
did,
guessed
wrong
as
to
the
price
that
should
prevail
for
regular
grades
of
gasoline,
you
have
the
consumers
being
hurt.
and
state
oil
guessed
wrong,
on
the
high
side
on
the...
on
the
premium
grades,
in
setting
the
maximum,
then
mr.
khan
was
squeezed
at
that
end
as
well.
this
was
a
squeeze
that
came
from
both
ends,
and
ultimately
resulted
in
his
failure
to
run
the
business.
now,
the
receiver,
which
refused
to
agree
with
the
restraints
set
forth
in
the
contract
and
was
free
to
do
what
it
wanted,
and
adopted
a
marketing
strategy
which
increased
volume,
which
increased
profitability
and
margin,
and
therefore
benefitted
some
consumers,
benefitted
state
oil,
as
well
as
benefitting
itself
and
the
operation.
and
that's
what
competition
is
supposed
to
do.
competition
allows
for
the
businessmen
to
make
a
reasonable
profit
so
they
can
stay
in
business,
so
they
can
invest
in
their
business,
to
recoup
their
investment,
and
that
return
of
investment
is...
is--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--the
rule
of
reason
analysis
requires
proofs
of
market
power,
quite
honestly,
which
would
exclude
almost
every
single
petroleum
market
case
that
you're
faced
with,
as
well
as
others.
absent
proof
of
market
power
and
impacts
on
competition
in
a
definable
market,
you
would
have
situations
like
mr.
khan
not
being
able...
you
could
not
address
his
situation,
where
he
suffers
an
antitrust
injury.
but,
moreover,
when
the--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--no.
in
this
case,
he
suffers
an
antitrust
injury
in
the
sense
that
he
cannot
price
and
increase
his
volumes
on
the
low
end
and
make
a
competitive
price
on
the
high
end.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
in
every
ca--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--he
made
some
additional
volume...
he
made
volume.
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
indicates
he
made
enough
from
that
to
be
able
to
sustain
or
improve
the
profitability.
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
the--
mr.
anthony
s.
divincenzo
--no.
the...
the
only...
the
only...
in...
the
only
evidence
in
the
