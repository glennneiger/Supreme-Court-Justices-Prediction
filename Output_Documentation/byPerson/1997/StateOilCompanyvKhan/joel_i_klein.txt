mr.
joel
i.
klein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
albrecht
should
be
overruled
because
its
doctrinal
underpinnings
have
been
eroded,
and
also
because
its
perpetuation
is
likely
to
do
considerably
more
competitive
harm
than
good.
per
se
rules
are
reserved
for
business
practices
that
are
manifestly,
self-evidently,
if
not
always,
at
least
almost
always,
anti-competitive,
whereas
maximum
resale
price
agreements
are
rarely
in
that
category.
if
anything,
we
submit,
they
are
more
likely
to
be
pro-competitive.
for
example,
as
the
court
express...
expressly
recognized
in
arco,
a
maximum
can
constrain
dealer
market
power,
which
is
something
that,
in
varying
degrees,
can
exist
from
time
to
time.
these
maximums
also
serve
other
important
purposes
relating
to
price,
advertising
and
discounting,
which
is
undermined
by
a
per
se
rule.
i
should
add,
as
precedent,
albrecht
has
had
an
especially
difficult
time
of
it.
its
dealer
autonomy
and
dealer
multiplicity
rationales
were
undermined
in
sylvania.
and
i
do
think
that
that
doesn't
mean
that
a
minimum
falls.
the
difference
is
that
minimum
resale
price-fixing
has
entirely
different
effects
and...
both
pro-competitive
and
anti-competitive.
but
it's
not
the
abstract
notion
of
dealer
autonomy,
justice
stevens,
that's
critical
here.
and
i
would
dare
say
that
albrecht
got
a
remarkably
chilly
reception
in
the
arco
case.
the
lower
federal
courts
have
whittled
away
at
it.
the
commentators
have
been
extraordinarily
critical
of
it.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i'd
be...
i'd
be
delighted
to.
i...
i
think
there
are
two
things
i'd
like
to
say
about
it.
first
of
all,
what's
significant
is
that
the
states
themselves
don't
cite
a
single
instance,
and
we
in
the
federal
government
could
find
no
instances,
where
an
enforcement
agency
brought
a
maximum
case.
and
that
seems
to
me
to
be
very,
very
telling.
that
is,
in
the
30
years
since
albrecht,
none
of
them
appear
to
have
brought
such
a
case.
second,
their
concern...
if
you
read
their
briefs...
their
concern
is,
somehow,
if
you
breach
the
wall
in
this
pricing
area,
that
you
won't
be
able
to
stop
at
minimum.
now,
i
think
minimum
presents
very
different
effects.
and
in
fact,
their
key
argument
is
that
maximum
could
be
a
minimum.
but
my
answer
to
that
is,
if
it
is
a
minimum,
it
will
be
treated
by
a
minimum.
and,
frankly,
i
don't
see
any
problem
in
detection.
the
notion
that
somehow
you
could
disguise
this...
after
all,
the
first
person
who
is
likely
to
object
is
going
to
be
the
dealer.
and
if
the
dealer
thinks
that
its
price
wants...
he
wants
to
drive
his
price
down,
he's
entirely
free
to
do
so.
and
if
he
gets
punished
for
that,
then
we
know
that
it's
a
minimum.
so
this
notion
that
it's
undetectable
seems
to
me
to
be
a
very
hard
one
to
sustain.
now,
in
addition,
the
only
other
arguments
of
maximum
and
minimum,
which
i
think
is
the
most
telling
thing
about
the
states'
brief,
justice
o'connor,
is
they
really
are
fighting
for
another
day.
and
if
that
day
should
come,
entirely
different
competitive
considerations
will
be
at
play.
but
the
other
thing
that's
very
telling
about
it,
the
only
other
argument
you
see
in
the
briefs
is
that
a
maximum
price
could
affect
dealer
service.
now,
that...
that...
that's
a
reasonable
concern,
but
i
would
say
several
things
about
it.
one,
there's
no
reason
to
think
that
the
manufacturer
is
not
interested
in
dealer
service
that
has
a
pro-competitive
benefit.
this
court
recognized,
in
gte,
it
recognized
in
sharp,
that
manufacturers
have
an
interest
in
order
to
maximize
their
profit
in
an
efficient
distribution
system.
second,
and
it
seems
to
me
crucial,
is
that
under
the
law
now,
after
gte/sylvania,
you
can
actually
impose
specific
service
limitations
in
your
contract.
for
example,
mcdonald's
can
say
to
all
of
its
dealers:
you
can't
have
waiters.
it
destroys
the
ambience.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
waiters.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
in
a
fast-food
restaurant.
they
can
condition
a
mcdonald's
franchise
on
that
limitation
on
service.
the...
the...
the
manufacturer
here,
the
gas
state...
gas
company
here
could
say:
you
can't
wash
windows.
you
can't
do
tires.
they
can
put
that
in
there.
now,
that
may
be
anti-competitive
ultimately,
but
it
would
be
tested
by
a
rule
of
reason.
so
the
notion
that
we
would
have
a
per
se
rule,
basically
because
it
might
impact
service...
a
price
restriction
might
impact
service,
seems
to
me
to
have
the
cart
way
before
the
horse
in
terms
of
what
would
go
on,
on
a
direct
restriction.
and,
beyond
that,
those
are
the
two
generic
circumstances:
maximum/minimum
and
effect
on
service.
beyond
that,
the
only
other
notion
that
comes
up
is
a
possibility
of
predation.
and
if
there
is
predation,
of
course,
that
would
be
a
violation.
but
the
court,
in
brook
and
many
other
cases,
has
realized
that
that's
quite
rare.
so
the
key
point
here
is
that
this
is
not
the
stuff
of
which
per
se
rules
are
made.
whether
you
could
imagine
a
case
is
not
the
question.
if
there
is
such
a
case
and
there's
competitive
effects,
the
rule
of
reason
is
there,
as
it
is
for
virtually
all
business
practices.
what
the
per
se
rule
is
reserved
for,
what
it
has
its
real
currency
in
is
practices
that
one
ought
to
look
at
and
say,
this
is
really
bad
stuff;
you
don't
need
to
do
an
in-depth
examination.
now,
what's
on
the
other
side
of
the
equation?
first
of
all,
you
asked
about
exclusives.
but
it's
not
just
exclusives.
look
at
the
facts
in
albrecht.
you
can
have,
if
you
will,
de
facto
market
power.
if
you're
a
newspaper
dealer,
it's...
it's
really
the
case
that
you're
going
to
have
an
area
which
you...
you
deliver
these
newspapers
to.
and
unlike
the
newspaper
company,
the
dealer
might
well
say,
look,
i
have
some
market
power;
people
in
washington,
d.c.
want
to
wake
up
on
a
saturday
morning
and
see
their
newspaper
there.
i
can
charge
more
than
a
quarter
for
that,
before
they're
going
to
go
out
to
a
machine
or
downtown
or
something
like
that.
and
then
the
dealer
can
extract
real
monopoly
profits
in
that
situation.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't...
i...
i
don't
think
it's...
it
may
be
the
states'
concern.
i
don't
think
it's
a
realistic
concern,
justice
kennedy,
for
sev...
several
reasons.
to
begin
with,
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion
about
price,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
time
and
again.
you
can
have
a
suggested
manufacturers'
retail
price,
as
long
as
there's
no
agreement.
but
they
discuss
it
all
the
time.
second,
it
seems
to
me,
this
notion
that
somehow
talking
about
this
issue
will
lead
to
unlawful
agreements,
i
think,
if
there
is
such
an
unlawful
agreement
that
results,
then
we
can
address
that
problem
in
that
particular
case.
but
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
somehow
say
that
we
need
to
eliminate
from
the
air
discussions
of
price.
manufacturers
and
their
retailers
discuss
price
all
the
time.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
say
two
things.
one,
i
think,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
the
standard
under
the
antitrust
law
is
a
little
different
from
many
statutes,
because
it
is
a
common
law
statute,
in
which
this
court
has
revised
and
changed
over
the
years.
gte/sylvania
said
that,
and
the
court
did
as
well
in
copperweld.
and
i
think
it
has
recognized
that
principle.
but
i
think,
whatever
standard
you
apply,
it
can
be
met
here.
i
think
if
you
look
at
gte/sylvania,
you
will
see
that
the
basic
notions
that
animated
the
decision
in...
in
albrecht
are
no
longer
viable.
there
was
a
view
in
the
mid-eighties
that
actually
animated
schwinn...
in
the
mid-sixties,
it
animated
schwinn
and
animated
albrecht...
that
said
there
ought
to
be
dealer
autonomy;
we
ought
to
have
lots
and
lots
of
dealers;
that's
better
than
a
few
dealers.
the
court's
opinion,
quite
clearly,
eroded
that
thinking.
not
only
that,
it
created
the
very
right
to...
to
establish
exclusives
that
albrecht
said
was
no
good.
albrecht
said,
well,
if
you
have
market
power
because
you
have
an
exclusive
territorial
arrangement,
then,
under
schwinn,
the
territory
falls.
but
now,
post-gte,
the
territory
remains.
then
i
think
the
next
problem
you
have
is
the
court
says
in
arco...
it...
it...
it's
really
an
interesting
opinion...
it
starts
out
by
saying:
we
assume,
arguendo,
that
albrecht
is
still
good
law.
it
then
has
a
footnote
saying:
albrecht
was
the
only
case
ever
that
dealt
with
a
pure
maximum.
and
then
it
goes
on,
in
footnote
13,
and
says:
the
pro-competitive
benefits
are
now,
quote,
clearer
than
they
were
at
the
time
of
albrecht.
and
they
cite
a
list
of
maybe
10
different
academic
articles,
all
of
which
are
harshly
critical
of
albrecht
for
essentially
mis-perceiving
its
competitive
impact.
then
you
look
at
what
the
lower
courts
have
done.
they
have
constantly
read
the
opinion
narrowly,
chipping
away
at
it.
no
antitrust
injury,
no
injury
in
fact,
no
damages,
no
agreement.
cases
involving
discounts
get
distinguished
in
some
sort
of
ways.
so
this
is
anything
but
robust.
this
is,
in...
in
judge...
chief
judge
posner's
words,
a
rather
moth
eaten
foundation.
and
then
the
point
which
i
would
not
discount...
justice
kennedy
said
there
haven't
been
many
such
cases
in
minimum
resale
price
maintenance.
the
states
cite
a
lot
of
cases
they
have
brought.
the
antitrust
division
has
brought
such
cases.
the
federal
trade
commission
has
brought
such...
such
cases.
these
are
real
enforcement
actions.
in
the
maximum
area,
there
are
no
such
cases.
it's
not
because
the
practice
doesn't
occur;
it's
because
government
agencies
don't
find
this
to
be
a
desirable
enforcement
vehicle.
and
then
i
would
just
say
the
last
point,
to
the
extent
congressional
intent
here
is
relevant.
of
course,
in
1991,
congress
actually
attempted
to
pass...
it
ultimately
failed,
but
a
different
statute
passed
both
houses,
trying
to
reverse
this
court's
decisions
in
sharp
and
monsanto.
and
while
the
ultimate
statute
never
passed,
mr.
chief
justice,
both
statutes
would
have
ensured...
both...
both
bills...
would
have
ensured
that
minimum
resale
price
maintenance
stayed
a
per
se
rule.
and
they
had
exceptions
for
maximum.
so,
to
the
extent
one
can
glint...
glim...
take
anything
from
that
congressional
reaction,
congress,
too,
realized
that
albrecht
was
no
good.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it...
it...
it...
i
only
point
to
it.
i...
i
put
it
last
on
the
last.
i
only
point
to
it
to
say
to
the
extent
heard
anything
from
them,
we've
heard
that...
what
little
guidance
there
is,
is
minimal,
i
agree.
but
the
key
point
is
not
what
congress
did.
this
is,
in
the
end,
a
common
law
statute.
this
court,
i
believe,
has
the
obligation
to
revise
and
change
in
this
circumstance.
and
the
reason
you
should
do
it,
most
importantly,
is
i
don't
think
you
should
strip
manufacturers
of
a
mechanism
that
is
pro-competitive.
if
we
leave
it
on
the
books,
that
is
going
to
increase
market
injury.
and
i
think
that
is
a
bad
result.
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
