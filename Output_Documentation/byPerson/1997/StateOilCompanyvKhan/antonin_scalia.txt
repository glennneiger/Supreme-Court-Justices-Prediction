justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
really
apply
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
recognized
by
whom?
not
by
our
current
antitrust
jurisprudence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
we
can
all
stipulate
that
there's
a
difference
between
maximum
prices
and
minimum
prices.
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
there
was
a
legal
difference
that's...
that's
been
established
in...
in
some
of
our
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
what
you're
saying,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
really
your
burden.
i
mean,
it's
surely
not
enough
for
you
to
say
that
there's...
you
can
conceive
of
circumstances
in
which
vertical
maximum
price
restraints
are...
are
healthy.
i...
i
suppose
i
could
conceive
of
instances
in
which...
in
which
vertical
minimum
prices
are...
are
healthy
as
well.
i...
i
think
our
per
se
rule
is
directed
at
situations
in
which
it
is
most
unlikely
to
be
helpful.
it
might
be
helpful
in
some
circumstances,
but
the
chances
are...
are
so
small
that
it's
not
worth...
it's
not
worth
taking
the
risk.
and
you
should
put
the
burden
on
the
other
side,
to
show
that
there's
some
exceptional
situation.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you...
can
you
persuade
us
that
that's
the
case,
that
it's
more...
it's
more
likely
to
be
good
than
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
your
opponent
here...
your
opponent
here
claims
that
one
situation
is
where...
where
the...
the
maximum
price
on...
on
one
line,
high
octane
gas,
prevents
him
from
charging
a
lower
price
on
another
line.
why
isn't
that
a
situation?
i
mean,
as...
as
i
gather
it,
what...
what
khan
wanted
to
do
was
to
use...
use
the
low
octane
as
a...
as
a
loss
leader,
and
make
up
for
the
difference
by
charging
a
lot
on
high
octane.
why...
conceivably,
that
could
benefit
consumers.
i
guess
there
are
more
consumers
that
buy
low
octane
than
high
octane.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what's...
what's
the
antitrust
injury?
what...
how...
how
is
the
consumer
harmed?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
he
ever...
why
does
he
ever
have
an
incentive
to
lower
the
price?
i
mean,
once
again,
this...
does...
doesn't
this
posit
a...
a
good
deal
of
stupidity
on
his
part?
that,
oh,
if
i
could
only
raise
this
price
more,
i
would
give
all
this
money
back
to
the
consumers
by
lowering
my
price
on
the...
on
the
regular
gas.
why,
i
mean,
nobody
behaves
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
by
that,
do
you
mean
that
some
people
who
used
to
buy
premium
bought
regular
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
more
regular
were...
more
people
came
to
buy
regular?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
that...
that,
in
itself,
is
a
justification
for
lowering
the
price
of
regular
gas.
and
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
it's
the
only
justification
that
someone
who's
selling
gas
will
ever
use.
if
i
lower
the
price,
i'll
sell
more
and
i'll
make
more
money.
i
can't
imagine
anybody
thinking,
oh,
you
know,
if
i
could
raise
the
price
on
premium,
i'll
be
able
to
lower
the
price
on
regular,
even
though
it
won't
get
me
any
more
customers.
i
mean,
that's
silly.
why
does
he
want
to
do
that?
this
man
is
full
of
love
for...
for
gasoline
buyers?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
ought
to
lower
the
price
of
his
regular
no
matter
what
the
price
of
his
premium
is
if
lowering
the
price
of
the
regular
will...
will
increase
his
profits.
he
ought
to
do
that
whether
or
not
he's...
he
can
fiddle
with
the...
with
the
maximum
on...
on
the
premium.
i
can't
understand
why
that
gives
him
any
more
of
an
incentive
to
lower
the
price
of
his
regular.
justice
antonin
scalia
no;
it's
to
make
as
much
money
as
he
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
if
by
lowering
price
he
can't
make
more
money
than
by
keeping
the
price
higher,
he's
not
going
to
lower
it.
he's
not
going
to
say,
i'm
going
to
lower
it;
i'll
lose
a
little
more...
you
know,
i'll
make
it
up...
i'll
make
it
up
by...
by
increasing
my
premium
price.
that
is...
that
is
senseless
behavior.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
intelligent
behavior
only
for
somebody
whose
whole
objective
in
running
a
gas
station
is
barely
to
stay
in
business.
then...
then
it
makes
sense.
if...
if
i'm
going...
opening
this
gas
station
in
order
barely
to
stay
in
business,
then
i...
i
might
want
to
raise
my
premium
price
so
that
i
could
give
away
money
by
lowering
my...
my...
my
regular
price,
even
though
it's
not
going
to
increase
sales.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
know
anybody
who
has
that
objective.
he
wants
to
make
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
apparently
doesn't
work
here.
because
you
say
your
client
feels
free
to
kick
the
premium
up
as
high
as
he
likes...
with...
without
being...
why
isn't
he
constrained
by...
by
other
gas
stations
from
charging
this
additional
money
for
his
premium?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
to
say
there
was
no
interbrand
competition.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
he
suffers
and
antitrust
injury?
i
mean,
i...
i
thought
it's
the
consumer
that
suffers
the
antitrust
injury?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a...
that's
a
com...
i...
i
think
we've
said
that...
that
the
antitrust
law
is
not
there
to
protect
merchants;
it's
there
to
protect
consumers.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
why
i
keep
looking
for
some
consumer
who
has
been
hurt
by
this.
now,
you...
you...
you
say
that...
that...
that
when...
when
the...
the
trustee
took
over,
he
lowered
the
price
of...
of
regular.
is
it
clear
that
it
would
not
have
paid
him
to
lower
the
price
of
regular
unless
he
had...
unless
he
had
increased
the
price
of
premium?
did...
did
he
not
make
more
money,
in
volume,
by
lowering
the
price
of
regular?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any...
anything
in
the
record
to
the
contrary,
that...
that
he
did
not
increase
his
profitability
by
selling
more
of
the
regular
at
a
lower
price?
justice
antonin
scalia
do...
do
we
know
that
he...
he
lost
money
on
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
harbour,
how...
how
extensive
is
that
experience?
is
it...
is
it
correct
that
there's
not
a
single
case
that's
been
brought?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
were
there
prosecutions
brought?
what
i'm
asking
is,
is
it
correct,
as
the...
as
the...
as
the
united
states
government
has
contended,
that
they're...
they're
unaware
of
a
single
case,
where...
where
you
or
any
other
state
has
moved
against
maximum
prices?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
cases
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
is
that
our
law?
i
wasn't
aware
it
was.
that
you...
you
cannot
exclusive
territories,
even
those
exclusive
territories,
overall,
will...
will...
will
stimulate
interbrand
competition.
if
in
any
single
territory
there
is
no
interbrand
competition,
you
cannot
restrict
that
dealer
to...
to
a
territory?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
one
territory?
justice
antonin
scalia
within
the
particular
territory
or
overall?
i
mean,
i'm...
i'm...
i'm
a
manufacturer,
and
nationwide,
there's
plenty
of
interbrand
competition.
but
you're
saying
if
there
is
one...
one
territory
in
the
country
where
there's
no
effective
interbrand
competition,
you
cannot
have
an
exclusive
territory
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
aware
we...
we
had
held
that,
but
you
think
that's
the
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
you
use
suggested
retail
prices
for
that
purpose
just
as
effectively?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
can't
you
use
suggested
retail
prices
for
that
purpose
just
as
effectively?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if...
if
you're
trying
to
get
a
de
facto
minimum.
