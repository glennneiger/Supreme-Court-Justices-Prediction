are
there
some
markets
where
freedom
for
the
dealers
is...
is
important?
are
there
some
circumstances
in
which
it's
advantageous...
and
i
won't
say
whether
it's
pro-competitive,
but
advantageous...
to
have
dealers
with
substantial
strength
and
substantial
freedom?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
one
of
those
instances
so
that
dealers
have
the
ability
to
switch
to
different
manufacturers,
different
suppliers?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
is
that...
is
that
ability
helpful
to
competition,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
suggest
that
that
case,
sylvania,
totally
rejected
any
interest
in
the
independence
of
the
dealer,
such
as,
for
example,
fixing
minimum
prices?
do
you
think
that's
at
stake
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
you
said
you
can't
think
of
any
example
in
which
a...
a
supplier's
control
over
the
maximum
price
the...
the
retailer
could
sell
would
ever
be
anti-competitive,
you
don't
really
have
to
go
that
far
to
win.
because
you
can
surely
conceive
of
a
case
in
which
the...
a...
a
seller
with
monopoly
power,
who
wanted
to
drive
out
competitors
from
the
market,
and,
in
order
to
do
it,
had
to
control
the
prices
of
his
customers
as
well
as
his
own
price.
i
mean,
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible.
justice
anthony
m.

but...
but
your
view
is
that
it
happens
so
rarely
that
you
shouldn't
have
a
per
se
rule...
you
should
have
a
rule
of
reasoned
approached,
rather
than
per
se?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is...
is
one
of
the
states'
concerns
that
if
you
change
the
per
se
rule,
then
price,
for
maximum
prices,
becomes
a
legitimate
subject
of
a
day-to-day
discussion
between
the
manufacturer
and
his
dealers,
and
that
this
will
create
a
climate
in
which
minimum
pricing
and
price-fixing
of
the
anti-competitive
sort
might
go
on,
and
that
it's
more
difficult,
then,
for
the
states
to
enforce?
as
it
is
now,
it's
just...
this
is
just
beyond
the
subject
of
discussion,
which
is
one
reason
why
there
have
been
so
few
cases
on
it.
people
know
that
you
don't
do
this.
and
if
we
say
that
you
can,
does
this,
then,
cause
a...
a
danger
of...
that
price
will
be
a
subject
of...
of
legitimate
discussion
in
some
instances
and
that
this
will
lead
to
abuses?
is
that,
do
you
think,
the
states'
concern?
