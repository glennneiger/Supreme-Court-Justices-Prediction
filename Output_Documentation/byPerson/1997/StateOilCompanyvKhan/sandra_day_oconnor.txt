justice

day
o'connor
mr.
klein,
we
have
a
brief
here
from
33
states
and
the
territory
of
guam,
saying
don't
get
rid
of
albrecht.
that's
going
to
hurt
our
antitrust
enforcement.
now,
would
you
like
to
comment
on
the
position
of
the
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
see
that
any
of
that
argument
means
you
couldn't
reach
the
right
result
under
the
rule
of
reason.
i
mean,
i...
i
just
don't
understand
why
it
requires
a
per
se
rule.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
it
stands
from
a
dispute
concerning
respondent's
agreement
with
state
oil
company
to
lease
and
operate
a
gas
station.
under
the
agreement
the
price
at
which
mr.
khan
was
obligated
to
purchase
gasoline
from
state
oil
built
in
a
profit
margin
that
khan
could
not
exceed,
thus,
through
the
agreement
state
oil
imposed
a
vertical
restriction
on
a
maximum
resale
price
of
the
gasoline.
after
state
oil
instituted
eviction
proceedings
against
khan,
he
filed
suit
in
federal
district
court
alleging
in
part
that
state
oil
had
violated
section
1
of
the
sherman
antitrust
act
by
improperly
fixing
his
gasoline
resale
prices.
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
state
oil
on
that
claim.
the
court
of
appeals
for
seventh
circuit
reversed
relying
on
this
court's
opinion
in
albrecht
v.
herald
co.
in
which
this
court,
in
the
year
of
1968,
adapted
a
rule
that
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
is
illegal
per
se
under
the
sherman
act.
we
granted
certiorari
to
consider
whether
the
per
se
rule
of
albrecht
should
be
overruled
in
light
of
subsequent
decisions
of
this
court
and
a
substantial
criticism
that
albrecht
has
received.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
based
on
our
conclusion
that
any
anticompetitive
effects
of
vertical
maximum
price
fixing
can
be
appropriately
detected
and
punished
if
necessary
under
the
rule
of
reason
applicable
to
most
antitrust
claims.
although,
the
doctrine
of
stare
decisis
is
the
preferred
course,
it
is
not
an
inexorable
command.
in
the
area
of
antitrust
law,
there
is
a
competing
interest
in
recognizing
and
adapting
to
change
circumstances
and
to
the
lessons
of
accumulated
experience.
we
find
the
conceptual
foundations
of
albrecht
had
been
so
weakened
by
subsequent
developments
in
antitrust
law
that
it
should
be
overruled.
accordingly,
we
vacate
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
remand
for
further
consideration
of
the
case.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
