well,
is
it
your
position
that
the
market
for
the
premium
gas
allow...
generally
allowed
for
a
margin
of
more
than
3.25
cents,
where
it's
just
3.25
on
the
regular?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that...
in
other
words,
the
difference
in
product
was...
should
have
dictated
a
difference
in
margin,
and
that's
what
he
was
trying
to
take
advantage
of?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
of
course,
the
consequence
of
that
normally
would
be
that
you
would
get
a
larger
share
of
the
premium
sales,
if
your
margin
is
less,
and
you...
you'd
be
un...
underpricing
your
competitors
on...
on
premium.
justice
john
paul
stevens
unless,
as
you
say,
all
premium
buyers
are
stupid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
don't...
they
don't...
yeah.
