mr.
john
baumgartner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
cause
would
like
to
accent
three
questions
in
this
case
this
morning,
if
possible.
first,
that
manufacturers
and
suppliers
have
a
legitimate
and
competitive
interest
in
the
maximum
prices
which
are
charged
by
the
people
who
carry
their
products.
second,
that
the
rule
in
albrecht
actually
hinders,
rather
than
enhances,
economic
efficiency
and
competition.
and,
third,
that
the
foundations
of
albrecht
were
destroyed
by
the
decisions
in
sylvania
and
arco.
unless
a
manufacturer
or
a
supplier
operates
his
own
retail
outlets,
the
only
means
he
has
for
reaching
consumers
is
through
retailers.
and
the
activities
of
those
retailers
vitally
affect
the
degree
to
which
his
products
are
sold.
for
instance,
in
this
particular
case,
khan
sales
were
also
state
oil
sales.
and
state
oil
had
a
legitimate
business
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
those
sales
were
handled
in
the
most
effective
manner
possible.
any
action
by
mr.
khan
which
reduced
those
sales
also
reduced
state
oil's
sales,
income
and
profits.
we
believe
that
this
is
the
incentive
which
a
manufacturer
or
a
wholesaler
has
when
he
attempts
to
introduce
a
maximum
retail
price.
we
also
believe
that
the
rule
in
albrecht
hinders,
rather
than
supports,
competition,
and
maximum
economic
efficiency,
because
it
prevents
manufacturers
from
ensuring
that
economic
incentives
offered
at
the
wholesale
level
are
passed
on
to
the
targeted
consumers,
who
actually
determine
the
competitive
outcome.
for
example,
a
dealer
who
wishes
a
price
reduction,
or
a
manufacturer
who
wishes
to
establish
a
price
reduction,
are
unable
to
agree,
at
least
to
the
degree
of
an
enforceable
arrangement,
that
this
price
reduction
will
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
and
the
supplier
or
the
manufacturer
is
therefore
discouraged
from
utilizing
price
reductions
as
a
man...
as
a
means
of
enhancing
sales
of
his
products.
a
dealer
who
wishes
an
exclusive
territory,
or
a
manufacturer
who
wishes
to
establish
exclusive
territories,
are
again
discouraged
from
utilizing
that
means,
because
the
manufacturer
and
the
supplier
are
unable
to
obtain
enforceable
assurances
that
the
dealer,
or
that
some
dealers,
will
not
ultimately
use
that
exclusive
territory
to
be
able
to
increase
the
price
of
the
product
which
they're
selling.
in
this
case,
when
the
price
ceiling
was
ignored,
the
consumer
who
purchased
premium
gasoline
paid
a
higher
price
for
that
gasoline,
and
the
additional
effect
of
an
inability
of
the
manufacturer,
or
the
wholesaler,
to
limit
the
maximum
price
is
that
an
increased
price
can
be
passed
on
to
the
consumer.
the
only
thing
which
the
rule
in
albrecht
really
encourages
is
vertical
integration
on
the
part
of
manufacturers
and
suppliers.
we
further
believe
that
the
foundations
of
albrecht
were
destroyed
by
the
decisions
in
sylvania
and
arco.
the...
arco...
albrecht
appears
to
be
based
on
four
concepts.
number
one,
an
objection
to
restraints
on
alienation;
a
concern
about
the
freedom
of
dealers;
an
objection
to
vertical
restraints;
and
an
objection
to
price
restraints
in
any
form.
sylvania
rejected
the
distinction
between
sales
and
non-sales
transactions
and,
therefore,
also
rejected
the
concept
of
restraints
on
alienation.
in
determining
that
some
forms
of
vertical
restraints
were
permissible
and
were
not
anti-competitive,
sylvania
also
rejected
the
concept
of
freedom
of
dealers
as
an
antitrust
concept.
this
leaves
as
the
only
real
foundation
for
albrecht
an
objection
to
price
restraints
as
such.
mr.
john
baumgartner
oh,
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
john
baumgartner
well,
the
dealer,
until
he's
committed
to
a
particular
supplier
or
manufacturer,
always
has
the
ability
to
switch
suppliers.
mr.
john
baumgartner
oh,
yes,
i
think
it
is.
it
induces
a
competition
between
wholesalers
or
manufacturers.
mr.
john
baumgartner
i
don't
believe
that
minimum
price
fixing
is
at
stake
in
this
case,
your
honor.
as
i
understand
sylvania,
sylvania
represents
a
switch
from
albrecht
in
the
sense
of
looking
not
at...
in
albrecht
the
court,
i
believe,
looked
at
possible
misuses
of
the
activity
in
question.
and
in
sylvania,
the
court,
rather
than
looking
at
possible
misuses,
looked
to
see
whether
the
activity
had
potential
pro-competitive
effects.
my
problem
with
the
question
of
minimum
price-fixing
is
that
i'm
not
really
in
a...
a
position
to
express
a
worthwhile
opinion
on
the
pro-competitive
aspects
of
minimum
price-fixing.
and,
therefore,
i'm
not
really
expressing
any
opinion
on
it
at
all.
mr.
john
baumgartner
it
does
not
apply.
our
argument
is
limited
strictly
to
vertical
maximum
price-fixing.
if
the
primary
concern
that
remains
from
albrecht
is
the
question
of
price
agreements
as
such,
it's
a
recognized
fact
today
that
price
agreements
cannot
be
realistically
lumped
into
one
sole
category.
there's
an
excepted
difference
between
vertical
price
arrangements
and
horizontal
price
arrangements.
there's
a
recognized
difference
between
maximum
prices
and
minimum
prices.
and
we
believe
that
the--
mr.
john
baumgartner
--even
in
the
decision
in
albrecht,
your
honor,
the
court
appears
to
recognize
that
there
is
a
difference
between
maximum
prices
and
minimum
prices.
and
that's
really
all
i
was
expressing
as
an
opinion.
mr.
john
baumgartner
i
know
of
no
legal--
mr.
john
baumgartner
--no.
i
know
of
no
legal
difference
between
the
effect
of
maximum
prices
and
the
effect
of
minimum
prices.
i'm
just
saying
there's
a
realistic
economic
difference
between
the
two.
and
maximum
prices
established
in
a
vertical
sense,
as
i
indicated
before,
can
be
used
in
a
pro-competitive
manner
and
should,
therefore,
not
be
found
to
be,
per
se,
as
a
matter
of
law,
unreasonable
and
forbidden.
mr.
john
baumgartner
yes.
i
believe
that
the...
the
most
significant
position
in
which
it's
pro-competitive
is
the
situation...
and
we
believe
that
situation
existed
in
this
case...
in
which
a
supplier,
in
this
particular
case,
to
assist
the
dealers'
competitive
position,
provides
a
reduced
wholesale
price...
not
in
one
specific
instance,
such
as
a...
a
price
war
or
anything
like
that,
but,
generally
speaking...
prices
the
dealer
below
what
the
dealer
would
normally
be
charged
as
a
wholesale
price.
and
we
believe
that
the
supplier
is
discouraged
from
doing
that
because
he's
unable
to
obtain
any
sort
of
binding
assurance
that
the
dealer
won't
pass
that
reduction...
or
will
pass
that
reduction
on
and
won't
simply
regard
it
as
money
on
the
table
which
he
can
then
use.
and
i
think
that's
probably
a
more
important
and
more
significant
instance
than
the
situation
in
which
the
dealer
has
a
monopoly
position.
mr.
john
baumgartner
i--
mr.
john
baumgartner
--i
believe
i
can,
your
honor.
i've
given
two
instances,
counting
the...
the
one
that
was
given,
three
instances,
in
which
it's
a
good
situation.
on
the
other
hand,
i
personally...
and
it
may
be
a
defect
in
my
imagination...
but
i
personally
am
unable
to
come
up
with
any
situation
in
which
a
vertical
maximum
price
arrangement
can
be
used
in
a
manner
which
will
reduce
competition.
mr.
john
baumgartner
well,
it
benefits
the
consumers
who
buy
low
octane
and
hurts
the
consumers
who
buy
high
octane.
actually,
there
was
no
evidence
of
that
ever
introduced
in
this
case.
it's
simply
a
claim
at
this
point.
but
i
would
alter
that
situation,
if
i
could,
your
honor,
to
the
situation
in
which
we
are
merely
selling
high
octane
gasoline,
and
he
wishes
to
use
our
product
to
subsidize
a
loss
leader
of
some
other
type.
in
mr.
khan's
operation,
he
carried
a
lot
of
different
products...
bread,
milk...
a
number
of
things.
and
i
think
we
would
have
a
very
legitimate
objection,
and
should
have
a
right
to
protect
ourselves,
if
mr.
khan
had
increased
the
price
of
all
gasoline,
for
instance,
to
subsidize
a
price
reduction
for
beer.
mr.
john
baumgartner
it
was
alleged
that
the
receiver
increased
the
price
of
premium
gasoline
and
reduced
the
price
of
regular
gasoline,
yes.
there
was
no
allegation
that
mr.
khan
ever
attempted
or
wished
to
do
that.
and
there
was
no
allegation
or
evidence
that
the
increase
in
premium
gasoline
actually
in
fact
subsidized
the
reduction
of
price
in
regular
gasoline.
it
may
very
well
have
been
that
the
reduction
of
price
in
regular
gasoline
increased
sales
by
enough
to
more
than
make
up
the
difference
of
the
lost
margin.
there's
not
really
any
evidence,
one
way
or
the
other,
at
this
point
in
the
case.
mr.
john
baumgartner
i
agree.
and
i
should
have
accepted
the
situation
in...
that
predatory
pricing
was--
mr.
john
baumgartner
--there
are
other
situations,
but
they
are
illegal
under
other
rules.
and
i'm
just
simply
saying
that
the
rule
of
reason
will
cover
any
situation
that
could
come
up
in
vertical
maximum
price-fixing.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
time
i
have
remaining.
mr.
john
baumgartner
thank
you.
mr.
john
baumgartner
we
have
nothing
further,
mr.
chief
justice.
