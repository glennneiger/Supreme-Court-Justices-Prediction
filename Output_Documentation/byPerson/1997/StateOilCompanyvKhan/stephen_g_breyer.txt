justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
their
answer
is
that,
basically,
the
only
time
that
a
manufacturer
would
want
to
do
such
a
thing...
not...
not
100
percent,
but
the
vast...
would
be
in
an
instance
where
interbrand
competition
was
not
working
perfectly.
otherwise,
there
wouldn't
be
power
in
the
dealer
to
raise
price
above
the
competitive
level.
that's
why
he
wants
to
keep
it
down.
there
isn't
enough
interbrand
competition.
i
think
that's
basically
the
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
sorry,
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
intrabrand.
you
mean
interbrand?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
the
reason
that
they
worried
is
that
they
have
some
market
power
in
there,
in
their
product.
and
since
they
have
some
market
power,
the
price
isn't
perfectly
competitive,
the
dealer
gets
more
market
power
because
of
his
position;
that's
why
they
want
to
keep
the
price
down.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
basic
argument,
which
i
guess
you
have
to
deal
with
in
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry
i
misunderstood
inter
for
intra.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if
i
understand
your
response
to
justice
scalia,
it
would
be
that
lowering
the
price
of
the
cheap
grade
will
make
him
more
money,
but
not
for
a
year
or
two.
so
we
have
to
stay
in
business
until
it
pays
off.
and
so,
what
we'll
do
is
raise
the
high
price
even
more,
and
that
gives
us
the
money
necessary
to
stay
in
business
until
the
low
price
pays
off.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
your
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
the
problem
with
that
argument,
i
guess,
john
d.
rockefeller
could
make
it,
too:
let
me...
any
monopolist...
let
me
charge
the
earth,
because,
you
see,
what
i
do
when
i
charge
the
earth,
is
i
take
all
this
money...
john
d.
rockefeller
and
others...
and
i
give
it
back
to
the
public.
i
charge
a
lower
price
eventually
for
my
heating
oil
or
for
some
other
product.
and
the
difficulty
is
not
that
that's
always
wrong;
i
guess
the
difficulty
is,
if
that
argument
were
allowed
as
a
response,
it
would
always
be
made
and
we'd
never
know
when
it
was
wrong.
i
mean,
that's...
that's
what
i
think...
you
gave
a
sophisticated
argument...
and
so
i...
i
think
it's
an
interesting
one,
and
i...
i
want
to
get
you
to
respond
to
what
i'd
call
is
a...
a
real
administrative
objection
to
your
sophisticated
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the...
the
reason
that
i
think
that's
awfully
important
is
because
what
you're
basically
doing
is
you're
taking
the
position
that
consumers
should
have
to
pay
more
money
for
gasoline.
now,
if
you're
requiring
consumers
to
pay
more
money
for
gasoline,
there
ought
to
be...
which
is
what's
going
on,
if
you
don't
let
them
set
a
real
high
price...
then
i'd
like
to
know
why.
and
your
argument
is,
because,
really,
maybe
it's
a
minimum
price.
all
right,
i
understand
that
argument.
it's
logically
sound.
but
what
is
the
evidence
that
you
have
to
make
consumers
pay
more
money
for
gasoline
in
order
to
stop
people
from,
you
know,
charging
a
minimum
price?
and...
and...
and
that's
why
i
think
this
evidentiary
question,
why
you
know
that,
why
you're
saying
this,
the
facts
of
the
case,
are
pretty
important.
so...
so
i'm
urging
you
to...
you
know,
why
do
you
think
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
quite
a
good
point.
and...
and
do
you
think,
then,
it
would
be
possible,
under
a
rule
of
reason,
for
a
firm
to
come
and
complain
on
the
basis
that
they're
a
failing
dealer,
and
so
a
failing
dealer
couldn't
possibly
be
in
a
situation
of
trying
to
raise
prices
above
the
competitive
level
unless
there
was
no
need
for
this
kind
of
thing
to
constrain
his
price?
i
mean,
that's
what
i
think
would
be
quite
interesting,
whether
there
would
be
categories
of
things
where
it
would
be
a
good
defense...
or
it
would
be
a
good...
a
good
price-fixing
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that
may
be,
but
they're
arguing
for
a
very
basic
distinction.
in
the
vertical
context,
the
one,
means
the
consumer
pays
low
prices;
in
the
other,
high
prices.
where
the
consumer
pays
high
prices,
that's
likely
to
be
bad.
where
it
means
the
consumer
pays
lower
prices,
that's
likely
to
be
good.
i
mean,
that's
a
crude
distinction,
and
it
requires
lots
of...
but,
i
mean,
i
think
that's
the
basic
idea,
isn't
it,
for
making
the
distinction
between
the
high
and
the
low,
under
the
antitrust
laws?
