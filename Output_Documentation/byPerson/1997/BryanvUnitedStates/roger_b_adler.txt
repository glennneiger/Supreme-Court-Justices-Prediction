mr.
roger
b.
adler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
whether
congress'
use
of
a
wilful
mens
rea
standard
in
title
18
u.s.c.
924(a)(1)(d)
requires
proof
of
knowledge
of
federal
licensure.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
yes,
your
honor.
petitioner
urges
the
court
and
petitioner
adopts
the
reasoning
of
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
of
the
third,
fifth,
seventh,
ninth,
and
eleventh
in
following
this
court's
holding
in
ratzlaf
v.
the
united
states
that
wilfully,
as
used
in
this
statute,
requires
proof
of
actual
knowledge
of
licensure.
here,
this
court
should
know
that
the--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--no,
your
honor.
we
part
company
with
the
government
by
indicating
that
it
is
knowledge
that
there
is
a
federal
licensing
requirement.
chapter
and
verse
are
not
required
in
order
to
convict
the
defendant,
beyond
a--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--yes,
your
honor,
knowledge
or
suspicion
of
the
existence
of
a
state
licensing
requirement,
municipal
ordinance
or
the
like,
will
not
suffice
under
respect
for
federalism
this
statute
penalizes,
as
only
it
can,
a
violation
of
a
federal
licensing
requirement,
and--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--that
is
what
congress
wrote.
that
was
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
firearm
owners
protection
act,
and
let
me
put
this
into
a
context,
if
i
may.
the
government
in
this
case
has
knowingly
chosen
to
pick
the
most
difficult
subdivision
under
section
924
by
proceeding
to
prosecute
under
subdivision
(a)(1)(d).
it
chose
not
to
prosecute
on
a
lesser
standard
of
knowingly
for
making
a
false
statement
in
the
context
of
the
application
to
acquire
the
weapon
under
924(a)(1)(a).
it
chose
not
to
prosecute
under
18
u.s.c.
922(k),
trafficking
in
defaced
firearms.
it
chose
not
to
proceed
under
a
violation
of
the
travel
act.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
congress--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--well,
quite
to
the
contrary,
and
i
think
it
has
to
be
viewed
in
the
following
context,
justice
kennedy.
a
majority
of
the
states
do
not
have
statutory
controls
with
respect
to
firearms,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--that's
correct.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
part
of
the
background
to
the
enactment
of
the
so
called
fopa
statute
in
1986
reflected,
as
the
legislative
history
indicates,
a
concern
by
the
congress.
a
7-year
effort
was
mounted
in
order
to
react
to
complaints
from
those
who
were
gun
enthusiasts
who
believed
that,
since
the
1968
statute
went
into
effect,
the
federal
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms
had
been
too
overzealous,
had
targeted
unfairly,
and
basically
come
down
upon
those
who
enjoyed
utilizing
firearms,
going
to
gun
shows
and
the
like.
the
basis
of--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--firearm
owners
protection
act.
[laughter]
and,
indeed...
and,
indeed,
the
very
statute,
i
respectfully
submit,
justice
scalia,
sends
the
message
to
the
court
of
the
intent
of
the
drafters
of
the
congress.
it
was
intended
to
provide
protection
to
firearm
owners,
dealers,
and
the
like.
it
was
intended
to
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
government
to
convict
individuals
of
violating
the
statute,
and
this
particular
subdivision,
and
the
only
subdivision
which
is
before
this
court
in
this
case,
deals
with
the
section
of
the
statute
which,
following
a
textual
analysis,
chose
the
mens
rea
standard
of
wilfully,
a--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
justice
trager,
in
denying
the
request
to
charge,
i
think
wrote
the
ticket
that
brings
me
before
your...
this
panel
today.
on
page
18
of
the
appendix
justice
trager
directs
me,
go
to
the
supreme
court
and
see
if
they
agree,
i
will
not
put
the
end
to
this
statute,
and
so
at
that
request
i
have
brought
myself
to
washington
to
urge
this
court
to
give
meaning
to
subdivision
(1)(d),
which
indicates
that
a
wilful
standard,
which
as
justice
white,
writing
in
cheek
v.
the
united
states,
indicated
was
a
voluntary,
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty,
and
in
this
case
the
known
legal
duty
is
the
duty
to
have
a
federal
firearm
dealers
license.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
i
appreciate
that,
justice
ginsburg
and
petitioner
respectfully
submits
that,
under
the
charge
as
given
to
this
jury,
and
presuming
that
the
jury
followed
the
law,
you're
absolutely
correct
that
petitioner
should
prevail.
the
government's
view
could
not
be
found
based
on
the
trial
court's
charge.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
yes.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
because
we
do
not--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--right.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
well,
it's
the
second
question.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
yes,
and
petitioner's
position
is
that
the
congress
lacks
the
power
to
create
a
federal
crime
for
failing
to
follow
a
municipal
county
or
state
statute
that
may
relate
to
dealership
and,
indeed,
the
legislative
intent
in
the
statute
was
clear.
the
villain
perceived
by
the
drafters
of
the
amendment...
and
there
was
a
unique
legislative
history,
7-year
effort,
a
discharge
petition
getting
this
legislation
out
of
the
judiciary
committee.
this
was
clearly
a
regional
effort
of
those
who
were
close
to
gun
users
and
possessors
who
wanted
to
trim
the
tail
of
the
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco,
and
firearms.
the
legislative
debates,
with
the
greatest
respect,
justice
o'connor,
are
devoid
of
an
indication
of
a
concern
that
the
firearm
enthusiasts
had
a
problem
with
state
or
local
individuals,
so
the
statute
was
clearly
aimed
at
the
federal
bureau
of
alcohol,
tobacco
and
firearms.
we
have
a
troika
of
three
reasons
which
basically
support
our...
petitioner's
view
that
knowledge
of
licensure
is
required.
the
statutory
title
telegraphs
the
intent
of
statute...
firearm
owners
protection
act...
in
the
same
way
that
the
clean
water
act
telegraphs
a
congressional
intent
to
take
a
strong
line
to
protect
the
environment
and
to
hold
corporations
to
a
higher
standard
of
proof.
the
plain
wording
of
the
statute,
the
use
of
the
word
wilfully
as
opposed
to
the
use
of
the
term
knowingly
in
other
sections,
of
section
924
also
sends
the
very
same
message
of
congressional
intent.
and
lastly,
the
congressional
report
which,
as
the
chief
justice
has
noted
on
prior
occasions
such
as
in
garcia
v.
the
united
states,
is
marked
as
the
defining
document
to
which
the
court,
if
it
reaches
legislative
intent,
should
look
indicates
that
the
congress
was
on
notice...
representative
hughes
in
the
floor
debates
indicated
if
you
adopt
wilfully
you're
going
to
require
knowledge
of
the
licensing
requirement...
that
congress
was
aware
of
it,
and
they
voted
it,
and
they
inserted
that
language
into
the
statute
which
was
passed
and
signed
into
law
and
became
the
law
of
the
land.
in
addition--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--in
addition
to
the
knowledge
of
the--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--we
must
presume
that
all
officials,
including
the
president,
had
knowledge
of
the
law
and
followed
their
duties.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
in
addition
to
the
contextual
analysis
that
we
have
spoken
to,
the
statute
itself,
924,
uses
knowingly
as
noted
on
three
other
occasions.
interestingly,
the
statute
itself,
when
it
speaks
to
sales
by
gun
dealers
to
out
of
state
individuals,
inserts
a
presumption
that
the
seller
of
the
firearms
to
an
out
of
state
buyer
is
presumed
to
have
knowledge
of
the
law...
section
922(b)(3)...
once
again
supporting
the
notion
that
the
congress
understood
that
it
was
actual
knowledge
that
was
necessary.
and,
to
the
extent
that
there
might
be
a
class
of
individuals
who
would
not
necessarily
know
the
law
of
the
sister
state
from
which
the
buyer
had
come,
congress
inserted
a
presumption
in
order
to
deal
with
that
situation.
no
presumption
is
found
in
subdivision
(d),
once
again
indicating
clear
support
that
whether
the
solicitor
general's
office
is
comfortable
with
that
view,
the
congress
knew
what
it
wanted
and
it
intentionally
made
prosecutions
more
difficult.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
oh,
i
think
the
use
of
wilfully
in
subdivision
(d)
connotes
the
highest
mens
rea
standard
that
our
law,
our
criminal
law
recognizes,
whereas
knowingly
speaks
to
only
an
awareness
of
one's
acts,
or
conduct.
when
we
speak
of
wilfully
violates,
and
the
section
says
a
provision
of
this
chapter,
it
is
much
similar
to
justice
ginsburg's
opinion
for
the
court
in
ratzlaf
v.
the
united
states.
wilfully
modifies
not
conduct
but
this
section
of
this
chapter,
so
when
we
see
wilfully
married
to
a
chapter,
a
clause,
a
section,
then
we
know
that
the
congress
has
telegraphed
the
intent
that
wilfully
modifies
in
this
case
the
chapter,
and
it
is
knowledge
of
the
chapter
which
the
statute
requires.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
well,
a
reading
of
section
924(a)(1)(d)
indicates,
most
respectfully,
that
it
punishes
those
who
wilfully
violate
any
provision
of
this
chapter,
and
so
the
use
of
the
term,
wilfully
violates
any
section
of
this
chapter,
connotes
it
is
wilfully
violates
the
chapter,
not
wilfully
engages,
or
knowingly
engages
in
certain
conduct.
the
prior
three
subdivisions,
most
respectfully,
we
concede
speak
to
merely
engaging
in
knowing
behavior
and
not
wilful
behavior.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
and
don't
act
by
reason
of
mistake
or
misapprehension
of
the
law,
but
so
it's
clear,
we
concede
that
one
could
wilfully
violate
this
chapter
by
engaging
in
what
is
frequently
called
conscious
avoidance
behavior
of
a
kind
such
as
if
there
were
a
sign
posted
in
a
gunshop
and
a
particular
defendant
operated
through
what
is
sometimes
called
straw
purchases,
sending
in
an
accomplice
to
purchase
the
weapon.
that
would
provide
no
defense
in
a
prosecution
for
wilfully,
because
the
individual
acted
in
a
way
to
consciously
avoid
gaining
knowledge
that
was
readily
apparent.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
well,
there
are
individuals
who
can
engage
in
conduct
that
may
violate
a
provision
of
law,
or
simply
is
inappropriate
behavior.
the
question
is,
does
it
violate
this
section,
which
requires
proof
of
knowledge
of
licensure.
certainly,
the
government
could
have
proceeded
on
a
proper
charge
to
prosecute
the
defendant
for
crossing
state
lines
with
defaced
firearms,
for
making
false
statements
and
aiding
and
abetting
in
the
false
statements.
they
chose
not
to
proceed
under
those
subdivisions.
they
chose
the
highest
burden,
that
he
knew
that
he
required
a
dealer's
license.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
well,
it's
not
our
contention,
justice
stevens,
that
you
have
to
know
exactly
what--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--you
have
to
know
it's
a
federal
licensing--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--and...
because
the
wilfully
in
this
case
is
followed
not
by
a
description
of
specific
factual
behavior,
it
is
coupled
with
the
use
of
the
term,
wilfully
violates
this
chapter,
and
this
chapter
is
speaking
to
in
this
case
the
federal
firearm
dealers
license.
not
every
transaction
is
a
per
se
violation
of
this
section.
one
is
only
a...
covered
as
a,
quote,
dealer
within
the
meaning
of
this
statute
if
one
engages
in
purposeful
activity
and
so
on,
so
the
congress
was
clearly
concerned
about--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--exactly.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
as--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--yes,
and
the--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--yes.
anything
less
than
actual
knowledge
will
not
suffice.
the
congress
could
have
used
the
word--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--with
the
knowledge
that
you're
intentionally
violating
a
known
legal
duty.
in
this
case
the
known
legal
duty
is
the
acting
without
a
federal
firearms
dealer's
license.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
no.
it...
you
have
to
have
the...
what
the
statute
penalizes
is
knowledge
of
the
dealer's
license.
the
fact
that
there
may
be
other
sections
that
you
suspect--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--we
take
the
position
that
1)
under
the
judge's
charge
the
government
cannot
prevail
because
even
the
standard
that
the
court
would
suggest,
generalized
knowledge
that
there's
some
section
of
federal
law
prohibits
the
behavior--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--the
charge
is
deficient
and
was
objected
to.
the
request
to
charge
focused
the
court...
we
cited
to
ratzlaf
indicating
that
it
is
knowledge
of
the
licensing
requirement
that
had
to
be
charged.
that
charge
was
not
given.
the
judge
went
further.
he
told
the
jury
that
the
defendant
did
not
have
to
know
of
the
licensing
requirement
and
did
not
have
to
know
he
was
breaking
the
law,
so
under
this
charge
he
took
the
issue
out
of
the
case
that
you
suggested,
and
we
objected
to
that.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
yes,
and
indeed
our
request
to
charge
asked
the
court
to
make
it
clear
that
this
defendant,
who
was
learning
disabled
and
acting
in
a
state
which
has
no
licensing
requirement
in
ohio
to
begin
with,
certainly
had
no
basis
to
know
that
there
was
a
federal--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--yes,
and
we
had
a
charge
conference,
and
we
objected
to
it.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
yes.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
i
don't
have
that
charge
reference
with
me
here
today,
your
honor.
i
can
supply
it
to
the
court
in
a
post
argument
submission.
but
i
do
recall
the
charge
conference
did
have
specific
discussions,
and
i
did
take
exception,
and
it
was
at
that
point
that
it
prompted
justice...
judge
trager
to
indicate,
take
it
to
the
supreme
court,
so
it
was
in
that
exchange--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--yes.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
yes,
we
do,
and
we
respectfully
submit
that
where
the
government
is
coming
from
on
this
case
is
attempting
to
hold
that
guns
are
inherently
dangerous
substances,
and
relying
on
cases
like
balint,
that
deal
with
narcotics,
hand
grenades,
such
as
united
states
v.
freed,
and
silencers,
such
as
in
the
cases,
the
circuit
court
cases
cited
in
our
brief.
and
it's
a
position,
we
respectfully
submit,
which
is
wholly
unsupported
by
the
history
of
decisions
by
this
court.
the
area
itself
is
constitutionally
protected,
the
second
amendment,
and
in
the
context
of
decisions
that
congress
has
made
in
other
areas
it
has
used
wilfully
in
a
very
sparing
way.
they
know
how
heavy
this
burden
is.
they've
used
it,
for
instance,
in
areas
such
as
this.
they've
used
it
in
the
osha
area.
there's
a
recent
seventh
circuit
case,
united
states
v.
ladish
moulting,
a
judge
easterbrook
opinion
that
came
down
the
end
of
january,
that
once
again
indicates
how
sparing
the
wilfully
standard
is.
once
again,
the
government's
position
would
have
been
better
had
they
prosecuted
under
a
different
section,
or
a
subdivision
of
section
924
that
had
a
knowing
requirement
and
not
a
wilfully
requirement.
in
terms
of
the
government's
view
they
have
created
the
veritable
straw
man.
they
ask
the
court
in
effect
to
feel
sorry
for
the
heavy
burden
that
they
have
because
they
selected
a
particularly
difficult
section
with
the
highest
known
burden
of
proof.
the
standard
that
they
urge
this
court
to
adopt
is
a
general
knowledge
of
unlawfulness.
this
invites
the
greatest
conjecture
and
speculation
on
the
part
of
lay
jurors.
it
is
a
standard
that
was
never
submitted
to
this
jury.
it
is
a
standard
that
will
not
be
found,
we
respectfully
submit,
in
the
house
debates,
in
the
committee
report--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--but
then
unfortunately
the
court
at
the
same
time
then
instructed
the
jury
that
in
the
context
of
deciding
mens
rea
knowledge
and
intent
the
jury
should
know
that
the
defendant
was
not...
need
not
be
shown
to
have
known
the
licensing
requirement
or,
most
importantly,
justice
stevens,
the
knowledge
that
he
was
breaking
the
law.
this
is
a...
the
type
of
a
charge
i
would
respectfully--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--yes,
in
the
context--
mr.
roger
b.
adler
--yes,
sir.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
yes,
sir,
i
do.
i
simply
want
to
point
out
that
the
government
urges
the
difficulty
of
convictions,
cases
such
as
united
states
v.
rodrigues
from
the
fifth
circuit,
cited
in
our
brief
united
states
v.
allah
out
of
the
second
circuit,
provide
the
kind
of
fact
patterns
which
we
respectfully
submit
under
a
fair
and
correct
charge
can
result
in
verdicts
that
are
sustainable
by
the
courts
of
appeal
and
sustainable
by
this
court.
we
respectfully
submit
that
this
is
nothing
more
than
a
red
herring
in
order
to
encourage
the
court
to
give
the
government
a
lesser
burden
of
proof.
in
essence,
what
the
government
has
done
here
in
its
brief
today
is
to
argue
the
reverse
of
bates
v.
the
united
states.
in
bates,
it
was
the
defense
that
argued
that
this
court
should
somehow
read
something
more
into
a
statute
dealing
with
the
fraudulent
use
of
student
loan
moneys.
now,
the
statute
indicates
wilfully
violates
this
chapter
and
the
government
says,
well,
you
should
read
something
out
of
it.
our
textual
argument
on
behalf
of
petitioner
recognized
that
the
bar
is
set
for
all.
it
does
not
vary.
if
it
helps
the
defendant,
so
be
it,
if
it
hurts
the
defendant,
so
be
it,
that's
what
the
congress
wrote,
and
accordingly
we
respectfully
submit
that
the
government's
approach
ought
not
be
followed.
before
i
sit
down,
reserving
the
balance
of
my
time,
i
simply
want
to
indicate
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question
that
we
rely
on
francis
v.
franklin
as
an
example
of
the
case
of
internally
conflicting
jury
instructions
as
a
basis
for
this
court
granting
relief
under
the
charge.
the
government
does
not
argue
harmless
error.
indeed,
under
sullivan
v.
louisiana
we
respectfully
submit
they
could
not,
and
we
respectfully
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
conviction,
and
remand
it
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
further
proceedings.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
roger
b.
adler
petitioner
waives
rebuttal
time.
thank
you
for
your
time.
