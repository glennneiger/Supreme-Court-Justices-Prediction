unknown
speaker
mr.
adler,
our
acoustics
are
very
good
here.
you
don't
have
to
speak
quite
that
loudly
to
get
through
to
us.
unknown
speaker
mr.
adler,
do
you
take
the
position
that,
in
order
to
act
wilfully
within
the
meaning
of
this
particular
statute,
that
the
defendant
has
to
have
knowledge
of
the
specific
statutory
provision?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
urge,
then,
that
the
defendant
has
to
know
there
is
a
federal
licensing
requirement
for
gun
dealers?
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
enough
for
him
to
know
he
can't
sell
firearms
with
out
a
license,
generally?
he
has
to
know
that
he
can't
sell
it
without
a
federal
license?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
the
congress
want
to
exonerate
or
not
to
punish
under
this
statute
a
man
who
was
quite
sure
that
a
license
was
required
but
he
thought
it
was
a
state
license.
unknown
speaker
you
say
respect
for
federalism
means
that
we
have
to
accept
your
view
that
he
has
to
know
that
it's
a
federal
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
congress
wanted
to
punish
people
who
had
a
guilty
mind
and
who
were
dealing
in
drugs
knowing...
or
dealing
in
weapons
knowing
that
it
was
illegal
to
transfer
without
a
license,
and
the
fact
that
state,
municipal,
federal
license,
it
seems
to
me
certainly
the
state
of
mind
is
the
same.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
in
the
hypothetical
case
he
thinks
that...
he
knows
that
there...
what
he's
doing
is
illegal,
and
he
knows
that
it's
illegal
because
he
doesn't
have
a
license.
he's
not
sure
if
the
license
is
state
or
federal.
and
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor
and
i
think
also
to
justice
scalia
was,
he
has
to
know
that
it's
a
federal
requirement.
unknown
speaker
and
i'm
asking,
why
would
congress
want
to
exonerate
him
in
the
first
instance
where
he
thinks
it's
a
state
license.
what
possible
function
is
served
by
that?
unknown
speaker
what
was
that
statute
you
said,
the
fopa
statute?
is
that
what
you
said?
unknown
speaker
mr.
adler,
supposing
you
were
to
accept,
hypothetically,
the
idea
that
all
that
was
required
under
(d)
was
to
know
that
there
was
a
licensing
requirement,
be
it
state
or
federal,
the
district
court,
as
i
understand
this
case,
charged
that
the
government
is
not
required
to
prove
that
petitioner
knew
that
a
license
was
required.
i
would
think
even
if
you
accepted
hypothetically
the
idea
that
it
could
be
knowledge
of
a
state
requirement,
that
instruction
would
be
contrary
to
that
view.
unknown
speaker
mr.
adler,
why
do
you
need
to
put
federal
in
there.
if
i
read
from
the
charge,
in
this
case
the
government
is
not
required
to
prove
that
petitioner
knew
that
a
license
was
required,
nor
is
the
government
required
to
prove
that
he
had
knowledge
he
was
breaking
the
law.
why
can't
you
just
say,
whatever
the
wilfulness
means,
it
can't
mean
that
he
doesn't
have
to
know
he
was
breaking
the
law,
he
doesn't
have
to
know
the
license
was
required,
and
why
are
you
making
this
yes,
you
must
know
that
it
was
a
federal
law?
our
federalism
may
be
a
big
thing
here,
but
not
all
the
public
appreciates
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
didn't
raise
that
issue.
that's
not
one
of
the
questions
presented.
your
questions
turn
entirely
on
the
need
to
prove
a
federal--
unknown
speaker
--firearm
dealers
license--
unknown
speaker
--that's
all
you
brought
here.
unknown
speaker
now,
the
instructions
may
have
been
totally
bad,
but
we
don't
reach
that,
presumably.
we
address--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
don't
think
it
is.
your
second
question,
was
the
jury's...
was
the
jury
charge
deficient
because
it
failed
to
require
a
finding
of
petitioner's
knowledge
that
a
federal
firearm
dealer's
license
was
required.
unknown
speaker
did
the
president
know
about
it,
too?
unknown
speaker
do
we
know
if
the
president
knew
about
it?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
we
do
that
for
congress?
unknown
speaker
how
much
weight
do
you
put
on
the
distinction
between
knowingly,
the
word
knowingly,
the
adverb
in
sections
(a),
(b),
(c),
and
the
word
wilfully
in
section
(d)?
unknown
speaker
well,
now,
you
say
that
we
know
that
congress
has
married
wilfully
to
the
chapter.
i
must
say
i
don't
quite
follow
that.
unknown
speaker
and
you
say
knowingly
simply
means
you're
aware
of
the
act
that
you're
performing.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
they
were
straw
persons
used
here,
and
there
was
misrepresentation
of
the
purchaser's
criminal
record
and,
unlike
ratzlaf
and
the
cheek
case,
where
the
conduct
looked
okay,
except
that
there
was
a
statute
that
said
no
structuring
on
the
one
case,
but
here
the
whole
thing
looks
bad,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
adler,
is
it
not
correct
that
one
could
still
draw
a
distinction
between
knowingly
and
wilfully?
knowingly
would
mean
you
just
knew
what
you
were
doing...
you
didn't
know
whether
it
was
illegal
or
not,
but
you
knew
you
were
doing
these
various
act...
and
wilfully,
requiring
a
proof
that
you
knew
you
were
violating
the
law,
without
adding
a
still
additional
requirement
that
you
had
to
know
exactly
what
law
you
were
violating.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
know
that
there's
a
federal
licensing
requirement.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
merely
relying
on
the
difference
between
knowingly
and
wilfully,
and
(a),
(b)
and
(c)
versus
(d),
you're
also
putting
heavy
reliance
on
violates
any
other
provision
of
this
chapter.
unknown
speaker
you'd
read
into
that
he
must
know
he's
violating--
unknown
speaker
--that's
not
a
necessary
reading,
but
certainly
i
understand
your
position.
unknown
speaker
you'd
say
if
it
meant
the
other
it
would
have
been
written,
or
should
have
been
written,
wilfully...
wilfully
sells
a
gun
without
a
license.
that
would
arguably
be
different.
all
you
would
have
to
know
is
that
selling
the
gun
without
a
license
was
unlawful
under
some
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
wilfully
selling
a
gun
without
a
license
wouldn't
necessarily
mean
that
you
knew
you
had
to
have
a
license.
you
wilfully...
you're
still
wilfully
selling
the
gun.
unknown
speaker
but
known
legal
duty
also
can
mean
knowing
that
you
have
a
legal
duty,
so
you
are
violating...
you
don't
have
to
necessarily
know
which
one.
suppose
i...
suppose
that's
my
view
of
it,
that
wilfully
means
you
have
to
know
that
what
you're
doing
is
a
violation
of
the
criminal
law.
suppose
i
think
that.
then
you
lose
this
case?
unknown
speaker
no,
you're
not
following
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
back
to
where
justice
ginsburg
and
justice
o'connor
were.
i
believe...
in
fact,
i
probably
do
believe
this,
that
wilfully
means
you
must
know
that
your
conduct
is
in
violation
of
a
criminal
law,
not
which
criminal
law.
most
criminals
are
not
familiar
with
the
u.s.
code
in
depth.
what
they
think...
but
it
is
possible
to
say
that
they
have
to
know
that
what
they're
doing
is
a
violation
of
federal
criminal
law.
i
also
think,
as
justice
ginsburg
might
have
suggested,
that
this
instruction
is
ambiguous
in
that
respect,
that
it
certainly
could
be
read
as
saying,
you
can
convict
this
person
even
though
he
did
not
know
that
what
he
did
violated
the
criminal
law.
but
then
i'm
with
justice
o'connor.
i
don't
see
your
objection
to
that,
and
so
that's
what
i
would
like
you
to
respond
to,
and
that
was
my
question.
if
taking
the
view
i
just
take,
do
you
win,
or
do
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now
would
you
go
to
the
point
that
i
think
justice
o'connor
raised,
which
is
instruction
request
number
8
does
not
seem
to
request...
it
seems
to
request
an
instruction
that
he
has
to
know
the
u.s.
code,
and
then
i
didn't
see
here
anywhere
an
objection
to
the
instruction
the
judge
actually
gave,
and
that's
why
i
started
this
out
thinking
you
must
win
because
the
instruction's
ambiguous,
but
i'm
not
certain
that's
right.
now
i
think
maybe
you
must
lose.
so
since
i've
thought
you
must
win,
then
i
think
you
must
lose,
i
think
that
i'd
like
your
response.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
objected
to,
he
did
not
have
to
know
he
was
breaking
the
law?
unknown
speaker
i've
read...
i've
read
number--
--you
objected
in
some
manner
other
than
filing
the
requested
charge,
which
insisted
upon
knowledge
of
the
federal--
unknown
speaker
--fine.
is
that
in
the
record?
unknown
speaker
where?
what
i've
read
here
is
page
17,
which
has
your
request
number
8,
which
has
the
details
in
depth
about
you
have
to
know
the
u.s.
code.
then
i
believe
that
you
said
the
word
objection,
but
where
is
it
that
you...
you
know,
district
judges
are
busy,
they
don't
catch
every
mistake,
and
so
someone
has
to
say
to
the
judge,
judge,
you've
made
a
mistake.
the
particular
mistake
that
you've
made
is...
and
then
you
spell
it
out
so
he
understands
it.
where
is
it?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you're
saying
that
even
assuming
that
you'd
lost
the
battle
over
ratzlaf
you
made
the
further
objection
that
this
instruction
is
wrong--
unknown
speaker
--even
under
the
government's
theory?
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
it
was
never
submitted
to
this
jury,
but
the
instruction...
one
of
the
sentences
says,
a
person
acts
intentionally
if
he
acts
deliberately
and
with
the
specific
intent
to
do
something
the
law
forbids.
that
submitted
that
to
the
jury.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
instructions
are
internally
inconsistent,
and
the
government...
the
government
argues,
in
effect,
that
the
message
was
the
one
that
i
described,
and
the
question,
though,
is
whether
you
really
focused
on
that
narrower
objection,
because
the
portion
of
your
objection
that's
quoted
on
page
18,
right
before
the
judge
says
take
it
to
the
supreme
court,
relied
entirely
on
the
absence
of
an
instruction
about
the
licensee.
that's
what
you...
you
call
attention
to
ratzlaf
right
there.
unknown
speaker
i
haven't
found
in
the
papers
that
we
have
the
narrower
objection
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--you
know
what
i'm
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
adler.
mr.
jones,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
he's
only
19
and
he
had
a
hard
childhood,
though.
would
that
solve
something
like
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
wilfully
means
something
more
than
knowingly,
so
we
have
to
figure
out--
unknown
speaker
--what
it
does
mean,
and
in
any
event
the
instructions
seem
to
be
totally
confused.
unknown
speaker
they
could
be
said
not
even
to
require
knowingly,
so
i
don't
know
where
we
are
on
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
mr.
jones,
do
you
think
the
word
wilfully
just
has
a
uniform
meaning
no
matter
what
the
other
context
in
which
congress
has
used
it?
unknown
speaker
and
here
you
have
it
juxtaposed
with
three
previous
sections,
all
of
which
used
the
word
knowingly.
unknown
speaker
knowledge
that...
conscious
of
your
actions.
unknown
speaker
wilful--
unknown
speaker
--just
a
minute,
mr.
jones.
unknown
speaker
actions
taken
with
a
bad
purpose
to
disregard
the
law.
does
that
mean
knowing
that
the
law
prohibits
something?
unknown
speaker
well
now,
how
does
a
judge
charge
the
jury?
without
sufficient
concern
for
the
law,
what
on
earth
does
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
this
confused--
unknown
speaker
--well,
okay.
now,
you...
let's
think
that
through.
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
does
that
mean
knowledge
that
the
law
prohibits
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
answer
my
question.
unknown
speaker
but
what
else
does
it
include?
unknown
speaker
how
would
one
prove
in
a
trial
that
a
person
was
indifferent
to
the
law
although
not
knowing
that
it
was
violative
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
he
failed
to
look
up
the
u.s.
code?
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
act
furtively,
that
would--
unknown
speaker
--that's
the
tax
case--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
welfare...
the
food
stamps?
unknown
speaker
i...
let
me
think
that
wilful
sometimes
means
two
totally
opposite
things,
sort
of
like
unpeeled.
i
mean,
let's
forget
the
instance
where
it
means
intentional
and
knowing,
you
know,
words
meant
to
be
very
broad.
let's
focus
only
on
the
instance
where
it's
supposed
to
mean
something
more
than
knowing,
all
right.
now,
focusing
on
that
instance,
which
i
think
we
have
here,
i
go
back
to
the
chief
justice.
we
could
say,
in
order
to
clarify
earlier
cases,
that
the
defendant,
the
jury
must
be
charged
the
defendant
must
know
that
he
is
violating
the
law,
though
not
which
law,
criminal
law,
and
add,
of
course,
reckless
disregard
for
the
law
in
this
instance,
i.e.,
reckless
disregard
for
whether
or
not
there
exists
a
criminal
law
that
forbids
it
is
equivalent
to
knowledge.
unknown
speaker
or...
now,
we
could
say
that.
unknown
speaker
if
you...
if
we
said
that,
is
there
anything
in
your
opinion
that
would
wrongly
be
left
out?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
asking
whether
it
could
be
found.
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking,
if
we
clarified
it
in
that
way--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
anything
that
would
be
wrongly,
in
your
opinion,
left
out?
unknown
speaker
another
thing
we
could
say...
could
we
say
this,
because
you
can't
think
of
an
example.
unknown
speaker
could
you
say,
it
includes...
normally
it
means--
unknown
speaker
--normally
it
means
you
must
know
the
legal
duty,
as
in
this
case,
know
that
there
is
a
legal
duty.
we
leave
up
in
the
air
whether
there
could
be
instances
where
they
are
equivalent
to
knowledge,
though
not
actual
knowledge.
is
that,
in
your
opinion,
what
the
court
should
say?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that
that
conflates
it,
it
seems
to
me,
with
knowing,
and
we
weren't
trying
to
distinguish
knowing
and
wilful,
were
we?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
did
we
do
it...
and
i
just
don't
know
the
answer
to
this.
were
we
distinguishing
those
two
terms
in
the
case
that
you
cited?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
my
only
point
is,
sure,
i
can
understand
circumstances,
textual
circumstances
in
which
it
would
make
perfect
sense
for
us
to
explain
wilfully
just
as
you
have
done.
the
tough
thing
for
me
here
is,
that
sounds
like
a
shorthand
for
knowingly
in
a
statute
that
uses
knowingly,
and
if
we've
got
to
make
the
distinction,
it
does
not
seem
to
me
that
that
is
a
legitimate
distinction,
is
a
legitimate
definition
for
wilfully
when
we've
got
the
two
of
them
together
in
the
same
statute.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
i'm
not
sure
ratzlaf
is
an
exception,
because
there
the
violation
was
structuring
the
transaction
in
a
way
that--
unknown
speaker
--evaded
the
reporting
requirement,
but
the...
my
understanding
of
the
facts
was
that
the
defendant
in
that
case
didn't
even
know
that
it
was
unlawful
to
structure
the
transaction.
he
knew
about
the
reporting
requirement,
but
he
didn't
know
that
evading
the
reporting
requirement
was
prohibited
by
a
criminal
statute,
so
even
that
case,
it
seems
to
me,
fits
your
general
category.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
even
needed
a
special
meaning,
other
than
the
meaning
you
have
here,
because
the
assumption
was
that
a
person
would
not
necessarily
know
that
breaking
up
a
$100,000
transaction
into
$10,000
components
was
itself
prohibited,
and
that
had
to
be
found
in
order
to
satisfy
the
ordinary
definition
of
wilfully.
i
mean,
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--right.
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
ambiguity
of
the
instructions
under
any
test?
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
that?
i
mean,
are
we
supposed
to
get
the
record
on
that?
i
mean,
i
imagine
we'd
get
it
and
look
at
it,
and
when
i
go
and
look
at
the
charging
conference,
they
say
when
we
look
at
the
charging
conference
we'll
discover
that
they
did
object.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
can
get
the
record,
can't
we?
we
can
get
it.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
he
said
that,
then
why
doesn't
he
win?
unknown
speaker
just
before
you
get
there,
when
the
defendant
proffers
an
instruction,
which
he
did,
and
it's
rejected,
and
the
judge
then
gives
his
instructions,
does
he
have
the
duty
to
make
the
further
objection?
unknown
speaker
i
was
talking
just
about
at
the
trial,
at
the
trial
court
level.
unknown
speaker
no,
he--
--it's
a
little
hard
for
him
to
object
when
he's
already
in
disagreement
with
the
whole
theory
of
the
instruction
and
say,
well
now
judge,
even
if
you're
right
you're
still
wrong.
that's
a
little
hard--
unknown
speaker
--to
do
in
the
trial
context.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
he
did
object
on
page
18
of
the
joint
appendix...
he
objected,
but
he
gave
as
the
reason
for
it
the
failure
to
require
specific
knowledge
of
the
license.
now,
the
question
whether
that
preserves
this
objection
is
a
little
different
than--
unknown
speaker
--what
about
this
one?
it
says,
nor
is
the
government
required
to
prove
that
he
had
knowledge
that
he
was
breaking
the
law.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
he's
applying
what
he's
just
said
to
this
case.
unknown
speaker
and
he
says
in
this
case
the
government
is
not
required
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
that
a
license
is
required.
unknown
speaker
nor
is
the
government
required
to
prove
that
he
had
knowledge
that
he
was
breaking
the
law.
it's
pretty
hard
to
take
the
words
following
the
nor
and
say
they
meant
the
same
thing
as
the
words
preceding
the
nor.
unknown
speaker
are
you
prejudiced
in
any
way
if
we
were
to
say,
take
your
interpretation
of
wilfully
and
then
say
that
on...
even
on
that
interpretation
the
judge
didn't
apply
it
because
of
the
language
i
quoted?
if
we
thought
that--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
you've
argued
it,
i
mean.
i
notice
the
last
point
in
your
brief
argues
that
the
thing
was
correct.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
this
was
not
urged
in
the
court
of
appeals.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jones,
do
i
understand
that
to
the
extent
that
the
defendant
made
requests
to
charge
and
they
were
denied
it's
not
necessary
to
say
exception
after
that.
if
the
request
is
denied,
then
it
may
be
that
it
wasn't
raised
on
appeal,
but
there's
no
further
need
to--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
jones,
you
focus
exclusively
on
the
word
wilfully,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
lining
up
all
these
cases
you
have
to
look
at
what
follows
wilfully,
wilfully
what,
and
it's
particularly
hard
in
this
case
to
argue
your
point.
if
it
had
said,
wilfully
sells
a
firearm
without
a
federal
license,
then
i
think
it's
much
easier
to
say
he
did
it
with
a
bad
purpose,
with
a
bad
intent,
what
not,
but
it
says
wilfully
violates...
wilfully
violates
a
provision
of
this
chapter--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
just
brings
to
mind,
you
know,
knowledge
that
he
is
violating
the
provision
of
this
chapter.
unknown
speaker
with
the
same...
the
same...
the
very
same
text?
unknown
speaker
was
that
a
statute
that
also
had
a...
had
knowingly--
unknown
speaker
--you
flatter
congress
to
think
that
they
had
that
case
in
mind
in--
unknown
speaker
--this
careful
drafting
that
they
do.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
case
that
doesn't
have
knowing,
for
some
section,
wilful
for
others,
and
so
would
you
just
clarify
once
more
what
the
difference
would
be
if
this
statute
had
read
knowing
instead
of,
as
it
does,
wilful?
you
agree
that
wilful
adds
something,
and
i
don't
understand
quite
what
that
something
is.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
knowing
that
there
was
some
law
that
prohibited
this.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
what
else
would
suffice?
what
else
would
suffice?
sure,
it
would
be
evidence.
what
else
would--
unknown
speaker
--well,
we're
trying
now.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
because
that
is
circumstantial
evidence
that
he
knew
what
he
was
doing
was
prohibited
by
some
law,
so
ultimately
that
gets
us
i
think
to
a
standard
that
says
there's
got
to
be
knowledge
with
some
degree
of
specificity
that
he
is
violating
the
law
in
doing
these
acts
which
he
understands
he's
doing.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
is
the
conclusion--
unknown
speaker
--that
has
to
be
drawn.
that
is
what
the
jury
ultimately
has
to
find,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
the
purpose--
--that
presupposes
that
you
know
there's
a
law
that
you
are
disobeying
or
disregarding.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
keep
saying--
unknown
speaker
--why
do
you
keep
saying
purpose,
because
again,
if
we're
supposed
to
clarify,
it
seems
that
purpose
isn't
right.
i
mean,
the
defendant
here
didn't
want
to
violate
the
law.
he
would
have
been
perfectly
happy
if
the
law
had
made
what
he
did
legal,
i
guess,
or
many
would,
so
why
do
you...
normally
people
wouldn't
have
the
purpose
to
violate
the
law.
they
would
have
the
knowledge
that
what
they
are
doing
is
a
violation
of
law,
so
why
do
we
want
to
say
purpose?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
any
reason
to
use--
unknown
speaker
--yet
criminal
statutes
are
supposed
to
be
clear,
are
they
not?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
the
judge
just
read
them
wilful
and
not
define
it
for
them?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
question
was,
does
he
have
to
instruct
them
at
all?
do
you
simply--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
justice
ginsburg's
question
was,
is
wilful
sufficiently
clear
so
that
there
is,
in
fact,
no
need
to
instruct
at
all?
just
say,
got
to
act
willfully,
period.
unknown
speaker
it's
sort
of
like,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
but
the
reason
you've
said
purpose...
i'm
thinking
of
the
clarification,
my
impression
of
what
you
just
said.
tell
me,
is...
and
i...
is
it
if
we
were
to
abandon
the
word
purpose,
there's
an...
there
are
a
large
number
of
books
there
that
have
that
word
purpose
in
it,
and
that
would
make
you...
that's
your
reason.
is
that
right,
basically?
i
mean,
is
that
what--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
trying
to
pin
down
what's
making
you
nervous
about
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
mr.
adler,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
