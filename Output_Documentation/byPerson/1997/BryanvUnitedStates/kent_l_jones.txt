mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1992
petitioner
began
making
repeated
trips
from
new
york
to
ohio,
where,
with
the
aid
of
several
accomplices,
he
submitted
false
information
on
federal
forms.
he
surreptitiously
purchased
numerous
semiautomatic
pistols.
he
undertook
to
conceal
these
acts
by
filing
the
identification
numbers
off
the
guns,
and
then
he
transferred
the
guns
to
new
york,
where
he
sold
them
for
a
profit
at
weed
spots
on
street
corner
locations
in
brooklyn.
now,
these
facts
lie
at
the
very
heart--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
not...
i
can't
endorse
that
conclusion.
i'm
not...
i
do
know
that
he
was...
i
think
that
he
may
have
been
19
at
the
time
that
he
committed
this
offense.
this...
these
set
of
facts
lie
at
the
heart
of
the
statutory--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
let's
start--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--let's
start
with
what
wilfully
means.
since
this
court's
decisions
in
murdock,
screws,
and
thurston
the
court
has
described
what
a
wilful
behavior
is.
wilful
behavior
is
an
act
taken
with
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
it
is
act
taken
with
what
the
court
described
in
murdock
as
an
unjustified
indifference
to
the
requirements
of
the
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
it
clearly
has
a
meaning
that
can
depend
upon
context.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
and
the
word
knowingly,
as
this
court
has
said
in
cases
like
staples,
is
simply
knowledge
of
the
facts.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
right.
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
constitute
the
violation.
the
ordinary
definition
of
wilfulness
is
something
in
addition.
it
is
knowledge
of
those
facts
plus
action
taken
with
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
i
mean--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--wilful
behavior
is.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
sir.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
could
include
that,
certainly,
but
it
could
also
include
the
situation
where
someone
is,
as
the
court
said
again
in
murdock,
unjustifiably
indifferent
to
the
requirements
of
the
law.
it
is...
if
you
think
about
where
the
word
wilful
comes
from,
wilful
behavior,
what
does
that
mean?
it
means
doing
what
you
want
to
do
because
you
want
to
do
it
without
sufficient
concern
for
the
interests
and
rights
of
others.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
basic
charge
that
this
court
has
approved
in
cases
like
pomponio
is
exactly
the
charge
that
the
court
gave,
which
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--not
all
of
it,
but
the
portion
of
the
charge
the
court
gave
that
says
that
the
act
must
be
with
the...
the
government
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
the
act
was
with
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
i
mean,
that's
the
fundamental
elementary
concept.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
certainly
that
would
satis--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
includes
that,
justice...
chief
justice.
it
includes
that.
if
you
have
knowledge
of
what
the
law
is
then
you
are
disobeying
it.
if
you--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it
can
include
an
appreciation
or
an
understanding
that's
short
of
knowledge
that
there
are
legal
requirements
that
apply
here.
that
is
what
the
court
talked
about
in
murdock
as
indifference
to
the
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
no.
the
court
has
approved
something
quite
different
from
that.
what
the
court
has
approved
in
cases
like
spies
is...
would
be
exactly
applicable
here,
and
that
is
that
evidence
of
concealment
or
of
covering
up
of
illicit
activity
is
the
type
of
evidence
that
shows
a
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
furtively,
or
as
spies
said,
to
cover
it
up
or
to
hide
it.
now,
in
only
two
cases
has
this
court
imposed
a
higher
standard
for
wilfulness,
the
standard
for
which
the
petitioner
argues,
which
is
a
knowing
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty,
and
in
those
two
precise
contexts
the
court
made
clear
that
it
was
adopting
a
special
rule
for
the
special
facts
of
the
statutes
that
were
then
before
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
tax
cases--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no.
the
tax
case
in
cheek,
and
the
structuring
case
in
ratzlaf,
and
the
special
reasons
that
the
court
said
justified
this
higher
standard
in
those
particular
contexts
just
don't
apply
here.
in
cheek
the
court
was
concerned
about
an
internal
revenue
code
that
applies
with
intricate
complexity
to
almost
every
facet
of
the
economic
life
of
every
citizen.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
or
is
a
sufficient
substitute
for
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
you
have
said
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
that
sort
of
description
can
be
found
in
decisions
like--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you're--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i...
the
only...
the
only...
the
hesitation
that
i
have
is
that
the
court
has
adopted
a
variety
of
formulations
that
address
this
ordinary
meaning
of
wilfulness,
and
i'm
a
little
bit
uncomfortable
in
saying
that
you
can
pick
out
a
single
one
of
them
and
be
certain
that
it
accomplishes
everything
that
the
court
has
done
with
the
other
formulations.
for
example--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
true.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
i
think
that
it's...
that
you
can
act
with
indifference
to
a
legal
requirement
that
you
do
not
know,
as
you
may
have
been
intending
when
you
used
the
word,
and
so
i
think
that's
precisely
why
the
court
has
adopted
broader
formulations.
i
want
to...
i
think
one
thing
that's
a
little
bit
confusing
here
is
the
fact
that
the
statute
talks
about
what
is
criminal
as
a
wilful
violation
and
petitioner
says,
oh
well,
how
can
you
wilfully
violate
a
law
if
you
don't
know
what
the
law
means?
the
answer
to
that
is
in
the
court's
opinion
in
the
international
minerals
case,
where
the
court
had
a
similar
statute,
and
what
the
court
explained
was
that
that
is
a
shorthand.
when
congress
says
wilfully
violate
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
f,
g,
which
is
essentially
what
it
did
here,
that
that's
a
shorthand
for
saying
wilfully
engaged
in
the
conduct
that
is
proscribed
under
a,
b,
c,
d,
e,
f,
g,
and
so
what
we're
focusing
on
here
is,
what
is
the
wilful
behavior,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you
have
distinguished
knowing
from
wilful,
and
we
want
to
make...
i
want
to
be
clear
on
that,
especially
since
this
the
statute
distinguishes
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
in
murdock...
murdock
would
have
been
a
statute
that
contained
separate
offenses
for
knowing
and
wilful,
but
that's
not
the
issue
there.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
what
this
court's
cases
have
explained
to
me
in
reading
them
is
that
the
court
has
distinguished
between
a
knowing
violation
in
cases
like
staples
and
freed,
which
is
simply
proceeding
with
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
constitute
the
violation,
and
a
wilful
violation
in
cases
like
murdock
and
screws
and
thurston,
which
is
knowledge
of
the
facts
plus
action
with
taking
those
acts
with
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
there
is
an
additional
requirement
to
wilfulness
that's
beyond
knowing,
but
it's
not,
except
in
two
exceptional
circumstances,
this
higher
level
of
specific
proof
of--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
the
peculiarity
of
the
statute
in
ratzlaf
was
that
the
statute
contained
as
part
of
its
substantive
element
this
additional
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law
that
was
the...
that
is
the
component
of
wilfulness,
and
since
the
statute
contained
both
wilful,
and
then
this
language
about,
for
the
purpose
of
evading
the
law,
what
the
court
said
in
ratzlaf
was,
we
have
to
give
wilfully
in
that
statute
a
special
meaning,
or
it
will
be
surplusage.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
especially
since
the
statute
only
applied
if
it
was
with
the
purpose
of
evading
the
other
requirement.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
the...
first
of
all
i
want
to
point
out
that
we
certainly
agree
with
justice
o'connor
that
this
aspect
of
the
contention
that
this
portion
of
the
instruction
was
invalid
wasn't
raised
or
preserved
below.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
petition...
the
charging
conference
is
not
in
the
record
to
the...
whatever--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--but
our
point
is
beyond
that,
and
frankly
i
don't
mean
to
stand
here
telling
you
that
i
am
certain
whether
he's
wrong
about
what
he
says
he
may
have
said
at
the
charging--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--because
he
didn't
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
he
didn't
raise
it
in
this
court
in
the
question
presented.
the
question
presented...
i
mean,
his
point
throughout
this
case
has
been,
he
was
entitled
to
an
additional
instruction
that
the
government
had
to
prove
that
he
had
a
knowing
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty.
he
wanted
to
use
the
ratzlaf,
the
cheek
special
rule
which
doesn't
apply
in
this
case.
now
he's
saying,
well,
but
accepting
the
government's
understanding
of
what
a
wilful
violation,
this
instruction
doesn't
do
it.
that's
not
a
contention
raised
in
the
court
of
appeals
nor
in
the
question
presented
in
this
court.
now,
is
the
instruction
adequate
to
do
what
we
think
it's
supposed
to
do?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he
has
a
duty
to
preserve
the
objection
for
sure,
and
i
think
he
should...
yes,
he
should
object
to
each
instruction
given
that's
inconsistent
with
his
theory
of
the
case,
but
beyond
that
he
has
to
raise
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
he
has
to
present
it
as
a
question
for
this
court
to
properly
preserve
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
at
the
trial
court
he
should
object
to
any
instruction
that
he
thinks
is
improper.
now,
what
he
did
was,
certainly
what
the
record
in
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
reflects
is
that
he
asked
for
an
additional
instruction,
which
was
denied,
and
it
was
denial...
the
denial
of
that
instruction
that
has
been
the
focus
of
this
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
litigants
bear
the
burden--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that's
precisely
for
the
reason
the
court
mentioned.
litigants
bear
the
burden
of
focusing
the
court
on
any
defects
that
they
believe--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
it
hypothetically
preserved
the
objection
at
that
point,
it
has
been
waived
by
not
raising
it
in
the
court
of
appeals
or
in
this
court.
now,
is
the
instruction
adequate
to
accomplish
what
the
government
thinks
that
it
should
have
done,
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
as
the
court
knows,
you
have
to
look
to
the
context
of
the
entire
instruction.
and
that
rule
is
especially
applicable
here,
because
the
language
that
now
defendant
objects
to
is
both
preceded
and
followed
by
language
that
directs
the
jury
to
determine
that
this
particular
defendant
acted
with
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
and
it's
also
accompanied
by
an
instruction
that
says,
which
we
think
is
clearly
correct,
that
the
government
doesn't
have
to
prove
he
had
specific
knowledge
of
the
federal
licensing
requirement,
and
to
us
the
two
sentences
that
follow
that
he
didn't...
that
we
don't
have...
that
the
defendant
doesn't
have
to
be
shown
to
have
known
about
the
licensing
requirement
or
to
have
intended
to
violate
the
law
refer
to
that
specific
law,
the
federal
licensing
requirement.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
believe
that's
the
sentence
that
follows
the
instruction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
he
doesn't
have
to...
the
government
doesn't
have
to
show
that
he
had--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
correct.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
in
the
context
of
this
instruction
which,
as
i
said,
was
preceded
by
the
clarity
that
you
don't
have
to...
the
government
doesn't
have
to
prove
he
had
specific
knowledge
of
this
requirement,
it's
our
understanding
that
this
adequately
informed
the
jury
that
the
witness...
that
the
defendant
does
not
have
to
have
been
shown
to
have
known
that
by
not
having
a
federal
license
his
conduct
was
unlawful.
and
that's
followed
again
by
the
instruction,
but
the
government
does
have
to
show
that
he
did
something...
that
he
acted
with
the
intent
to
do
something
that
was
unlawful.
that
is,
that
he
acted
with
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
would
just
be
the
expense
and
delay.
it
would
not
be
a
fundamental
prejudice,
because
the
fundamental--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
i
mean,
we
believe
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
mean,
instructions
are
reviewed
with
a
certain
amount
of
latitude
for
the
realities
of
the
concrete
problems
that
the
court
has
addressed,
and
especially
when
we
don't
have
this
objection
preserved
throughout
the
case.
it
seems
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
try
to
parse
the
instruction
at
this
point
to
come
up
with
a
better
one,
because
it's
almost
always
possible
to
come
up
with
a
better
one--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
sir.
nor
is
it
within
the
scope
of
the
question
presented
in
this
court.
i
would
like
to
address
a
couple
of
arguments
that
weren't...
that
i
didn't
hear
made--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--we're
not
contending
that
he
can't
continue
to
raise
the
objection
that
he
wanted
the
instruction
that
was
denied.
we're
just
saying
he
didn't
preserve
any
objection
to
the
instructions
that
were
given.
in
the
brief,
petitioner
relies
on
some
pre-1986
cases
involving
the
use
of
the
word
wilfully
under
other
provisions
of
the
act
and
says
that
those
cases
reflect
that
courts
had
understood
this
term
to
talk
about
knowing
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty
before
congress
added
the
word
wilfully
in
1986
to
section
924.
all
i
want
to
say
about
that
argument
is
that
the
cases
that
they
cite
don't
support
it.
in
fact,
the
principal
appellate
authority
that
they
cite,
the
stein's,
inc.
case,
applies
the
longstanding
rule
that
a
wilful
violation,
a
wilful
behavior
is
action
taken
with
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law,
and
cites
appellate
authority
of
its
own
circuit,
which
in
turn
cites
this
court's
opinion
in
murdock.
so
actually,
to
the
extent
that
preexisting
precedent
is
relevant,
it
supports
the
understanding
that
congress
used
the
term
in
its
ordinary
meaning.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
actually--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--justice
scalia,
that's
the
point
i
was
addressing
earlier
about
the
court's
opinion
in
the
international
minerals
case,
that
the
right
way
to
read
this
statute
is
that
it...
that
what
has...
what
congress
has
proscribed
is
a
wilful,
in
this
case
dealing
in
firearms
without
a
license,
because
what
the
statute
says
is,
wilfully
violate
any
other
provision
of
this
chapter.
and
what
congress...
i
mean,
what
this
court
said
in
international
minerals
that
phrasing
means
is
that
it's
a
shorthand,
that
it's
a
simplified
way
of
essentially
adding
wilfully
to
each
of
those
other
subsections
and
making
it
a
crime,
and
so
the
statute--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
it
said...
the
text
that
was
involved
in
the
international
minerals
was
wilfully
violate
any
regulation,
and
in
the
court's...
and
the
court
said,
well,
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
knew
that
it
was
a
regulation
they
were
violating.
it
means
that
they
knew
that
their
conduct
was
wilful,
and
so
you...
i'm
sorry.
that
case--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--actually,
that
was
what
i
was
about
to
correct
myself.
what
that
statute
said
was
knowingly
violate
a
regulation,
but
what
the
court
explained
was
that
knowingly
violate
is
just
a
shorthand
way
of
saying,
knowingly
doing
the
acts
that
are
elsewhere
in
the
statute
described
as
violations
of
the
acts,
and
so...
and
that
it
was
simply
a
shorthand.
congress
doesn't
have
to
write
for
each
of
these
criminalizations
of
various
violations
of
the
subchapter
a
separate
subchapter
that
says,
and
knowingly...
and
knowingly
dealing
in
firearms
without
a
license,
and
knowingly
doing
this
and
knowingly
doing
that,
or
wilfully
doing
this.
that's
the
point
of
the
international
minerals
case,
and
congress
surely
can
rely
on
that
decision
in
its
choice
of
draftsmanship.
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute,
if
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i
certainly
think--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they're
entitled...
i
would
think
that
they
would
have
that
case
in
mind,
because
it's
not
uncommon
for
congress
to
have
this
sort
of
provision
that...
about
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--a
knowing
violation,
this
court
has
said
in
numerous
cases,
is
acting
with
knowledge
of
the
facts
that
constitute
the
violation.
for
example,
in
staples
it
was
acting
with
knowledge
that
this
thing
that
the
guy
had
was
a
machine
gun.
it
doesn't
mean
that
he
had
to
know
that
it
was
improper
for
him
to
have
such
a
machine
gun.
he
just
had
to
know
that
it
was
one.
whereas
a
wilful
violation
would
be
knowing
that
it
was
a
machine
gun
plus
holding
it
with
the
bad
purpose
to
disobey
or
disregard
the
law.
that's
the
ordinary
meaning
of
wilful.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that
would
certainly
be
evidence
of
the
bad
purpose--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--this
court
has
never
really
tried
to
answer
that
question
except--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no...
well,
maybe
you
are,
but
you've
answered
it
only
indirectly
by
saying,
as
in
spies,
well
clearly
evidence
of
concealment,
covering
up
would
be
sufficient.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't
think
that
there
has
to
be
evidence
of
that.
i
mean,
that
may
be
where--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
having
trouble--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
the
jury
ultimately
has
to
find,
as
they
were
instructed
in
this
case,
that
the
action
was
taken
for
the
purpose
of
disobeying
the
law
or
disregarding
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that
the
general
knowledge
instruc...
the
general
knowledge
articulation
given
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
directed
at
that.
what
they're
trying
to
describe
is
a
sufficient
knowledge.
it
may
be
of
the
law.
it
may
be
of
some
fact.
it
is
a
sufficient
knowledge
that
it
is
appropriate
to
find
that
this
particular
defendant
acted
with
the
bad
purpose
of
disregarding
the
law--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--acted,
as
the
court
said
in
murdock,
with
unjustified
indifference
to
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
one
of
the
formulations
the
court
has
given
is,
with
the
bad
purpose
or
evil
intent
of
violating
the
law.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
a
blameworthiness
standard.
we're
talking
about
something
that's
sort
of
like
fundamental
to
the
criminal
law,
that
the
party
has
done
something
blameworthy,
and
that
the
court
has
used
numerous
formulations
to
accomplish
that
essential
goal.
and
our
own...
and
what
this
case
is
really
about
is
whether
there's
any
requirement
that
we
have
some
extraordinary
standard
that
applies
in
this
particular
case,
and
for
the
reasons
our
brief
said,
and
that
i've
tried
to
summarize,
no,
the
extraordinary
standard
isn't
applicable.
the
ordinary
standard
is.
and
if
i
can't
tell
you
exactly
what
that
ordinary
standard
is,
it's
because
this
court
has
given
us
several
different
descriptions
of
it,
and
so
if
i
were
to
say
that
only
one
applied,
i
think
it
would
be
an
incomplete
description,
because
criminal
blameworthiness
is
maybe
not
something
that
is
capable
of
crystalline
definition.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
it's...
i
think
jurors
in
their
common
experience
understand
what
wilful
behavior
is,
and
certainly
this
court
has
long
upheld
statutes
that
impose
that
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
purpose
of
instructions
is
to
assist
the
jury.
i
think
that
the
instructions
that
the
court
approved
in
murdock
and
in
pomponio
about
bad
purpose
to
disobey
and
disregard
the
law,
it
appears
in
form
instruction
manuals.
i
think
it
assists
the
jury.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
pardon
me?
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
some
assistance
is
appropriate.
the
court
has
always
approved
the
instructions
for
wilfulness.
i
mean--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--perhaps.
i
mean,
i
frankly...
i
don't
know
the
criteria
that
the
court
applies
in
deciding
whether
to
give
an
instruction.
i've
never
seen
that
discussed.
but
certainly
i
can
tell
you
that
the
court
has
customarily
given
instructions
on
terms
like
wilful.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you've
asked
me
what
my
reason
was.
i
didn't
have
that
particular
reason
in
mind,
but
now
that
you've
mentioned
it
i
certainly
think
that
that
would
be
a
problem.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
would
be...
the
court's
treading
here
over
decades
of
statutes,
and
it's
important
that
we
don't
reinvent
the
wheel
in
a
way
that
maybe
leaves
a
spoke
out
that
we
need
somewhere
and
that,
frankly,
i'm
not
in
a
position
to
describe
at
this
point.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
