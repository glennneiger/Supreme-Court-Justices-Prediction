justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
isn't
whether
they
have
adjudicated
it
finally
and
will
not
come
back
to
it.
you're
quite
right
that
they
wouldn't
come
back
to
it.
the
issue
is
whether
we
could
pick
it
up
later
on,
after
they
simply
say,
it's
law
of
the
case,
there
is
no
federal
cause
of
action.
at
that
point
you
have
a
final
judgment,
the
whole
thing
has
been
dismissed,
and
you
could
come
here.
is
there
some
reason
why
you
couldn't
come
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
well,
that
may
well
be,
but
we're
bound
by
the
federal
statute,
which
says
that
the
case
has
to
be
finally
decided
by
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
finally
decided,
and
the
highest
court
of
the
state
is
going
to
have
this
case
back
again,
or
may
well
have
the
case
back
again
on
the
state
law
claims,
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
always--
--that's
a
happy
ending.
you
could
lose
on
the
state
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
the
whole
thing
could
be
washed
out,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
resolve
finality
issue
by
issue.
i
mean,
our
cases
make
it
clear
that
if
any
of
the
claims
in
the
case
are
still
alive,
the
judgment
is
not
final,
and
there
are
claims
still
alive
here,
the
state
claims.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
only
way
you
can
get
out
of
the
problem
is
to
say,
this
comes
within
one
of
the
exceptions,
to
wit,
there's
no
other
way
to
appeal
this
federal
claim
unless
i
can
appeal
it
now,
which
was
the
situation
in
the
case
that
the
chief
justice
described,
but
i
don't
see
why
that's
the
situation
here.
it
seems
to
me
you
can
come
back
up
here.
i
know
it
takes
2
more
years,
and
we're
duplicating
effort
and
all
of
that,
but
that's
what
this
statute
envisions.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
pantazis,
just
for
fun,
why
don't
you
tell
us
about
the
merits
of
the
case.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
money
in
the
estate
may
never
get
to
the
family.
i
mean,
the
decedent
may
owe
a
lot
of
money,
and
all
the
money
in
the
estate
would
go
to
his
creditors.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
wrongful
death
recovery.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
survival
recovery.
the
survival
recovery,
the
recovery
that
the
decedent
gets
for
the
decedent's
own
pain
and
suffering
goes
into
the
decedent's
estate,
and
the
creditors
can
gobble
it
all
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
a
strange
system.
i
mean,
i
guess
it's
the
civil
law,
but
i...
why
would
the
estate
sue
to
get
money
for...
not
for
the
estate,
but
for
relatives?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
hope
you
have
a
sympathetic
administrator
of
the
estate,
who
likes
the
family,
because
it's
no
money
in
his
pocket.
