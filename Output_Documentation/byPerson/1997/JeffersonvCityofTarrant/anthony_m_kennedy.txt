but
it
says
where
further
federal...
it
says,
but
in
which
later
review
of
the
federal
issue
cannot
be
had,
and
under
the
law
of
the
case,
alabama
could
conceivably
change
its
mind
if
there
were
some
intervening
decision,
perhaps
by
the
eleventh
circuit.
probably
it
won't,
but
nevertheless,
you
can't
say,
in
which
later
review
of
the
federal
issue
cannot
be
had.
that's
just
not...
that's...
you
just
haven't
complied
with
that
exception.
now...
and
maybe
you
might
ask
us
to
have
some
further
exception
and
say,
well,
it's
duplicative,
or
something
like
that,
but
i
don't
think
you
can
come
within
exception
3.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
there
were
some
intervening
decisions.
couldn't
you
tell
the
alabama
supreme
court,
you
made
a
mistake
here,
there
are
some
intervening
decisions
from
this
court,
or
from
a
court
of
appeals
of
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
there
might
well
be,
please
take
another
look
at
this?
they
have
the
discretion
to
do
that.
the
rule
of
law
of
the
case
is
discretionary,
i
take
it,
in
alabama.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
say
that
under
alabama
law,
for
a
wrongful
death,
the
proceeds
have
to
go
to
the
estate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--can
he
argue
that
he
comes
within
your...
the
petitioner
comes
within
the
second
exception
because
the
federal
issue
will
necessarily
survive
on
the
grounds
that
the
standard
of
care
is
different
and
less
under
the
federal
cause
of
action
that
they
want
to
apply?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
only
way
they
could
do
it,
to
come
within
section
2.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
line
of
reasoning
justice
stevens
is
exploring
was
the
reasoning
of
the
court
in...
the
district
court
in
weeks,
was
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
read
that...
read
that
opinion,
it
says,
well,
there's
a
wrongful
death
action,
and
that
other
problem,
and
so
we'll...
and
we'll
keep
that.
that
other
problem
is
damages.
you
can't
have
punitive
damages,
but
that's
a
federal
rule.
you
can't
have
compensatory
damages,
that's
an
alabama
rule,
and
we'll
set
that
aside.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
the
reasoning,
anyway.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
think
that's
wrong.
