justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
federal
issue
could
become
academic
if
you
go
back
and
on
the
state
claim
there's
a
determination
that
there
was
no
wrongful
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
city.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
here
you
could
conceivably,
if
you
should
prevail
on
the
state
claim
you
could
then
bring
up
that
you
should
also
have
had
a
1983
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
they
would
then
say,
it's
law
of
the
case,
and
so
we
deny...
in
dealing
with
the
appeal
you
would
have
a
final
disposition,
and
you
could
come
here
again.
in
that
respect
it's
different
from
cox
v.
cohn.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
were
to
prevail
on
the
state
claim
and
then
ultimately
prevail
here
on
your
1983
case,
you
wouldn't
have
to
have
a
whole
new
trial.
couldn't
you
get
some
mileage
from
the
state,
the
trial
on
the
state
claim
in
which
you
succeeded
so
that
you
wouldn't
have
to
duplicate
all
that
evidence?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
with
respect
to
the
liability
and
fault--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--measure
of
damages
would
certainly
be
different,
but
i
don't
understand
why
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
fault
issues
would
necessarily
be
different.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
pantazis,
there's
a
distinction,
i'm
sure
you
are
aware,
between
survival
statutes
and
wrongful
death
acts,
and
one
is
thought
as
compensating
the
bereaved
family
members,
and
the
other
is
thought
as
going
to
the
estate,
as
the
claims
that
the
decedent
would
have
if
she
had
survived,
her
pain
and
suffering,
and
that
goes
to
the
estate.
but
you
seem,
in
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
to
blend
those
two,
and
i
was
wondering
why
you
cast
your
complaint
in
survival
act
terms,
and
yet
in
your
response
just
now
about
the
family
members
you
seem
to
be
shifting
over
to
the
wrongful
death
mode.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
would
the
court
be
getting
those
rules
from?
they
don't
get
them
from
alabama,
because
alabama
allows
only
a
punitive
damage
recovery.
they
don't...
and
1983
itself
doesn't
tell
us.
that's
why
we
usually
plug
in
the
state
remedy.
so
we
don't
have
a
federal
remedy,
we
don't
have
the
state
remedy,
so
where
does
the
court
get
the
instruction,
where
does
this
court
get
the
instructions
to
give
the
alabama
supreme
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
a
case
some
years
ago...
justice
powell's
decision
in
pennsylvania
v.
ritchie
would
seem
to
come
pretty
close
to
what
is
being
sought
here.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
would
depend
on
what
the
finding
is,
and
if
it
turns
out
that
the...
the
defense,
as
i
understand
it,
is
we
did
nothing
wrong.
we
came
as
quickly
as
we
could.
she
was
already
dead.
if
those
are
the
findings
that
are
made,
then
there
couldn't
be
any
1983
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
robertson
was
a
peculiar
case
in
that
there
were
no
surviving
members
of
the
family.
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--idiosyncratic
in
that
respect
i
thought,
where
here,
there
would
be
no
case
in
which
there
could
be
a
recovery.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
i
don't
have
the
opinion
in
robertson
in
front
of
me,
but
i
vaguely
remember
something
in
the
opinion
that
pointed
out
that
this
was
a
peculiar
case
because
there
were
no
surviving
members
of
the
family.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
isn't
it...
and
this
is
a
federal
claim,
and
it
picks
up
on
state
law,
auxiliary
state
law,
that
you
could
have
a
result
on
this...
under
this
federal
claim
for
relief
of
no
recovery
at
all
in
alabama
and
a
whopping
recovery
in
the
neighboring
state,
all
under
this
federal
cause
of
action.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
state
law
that
says
no
recovery
would
be
inconsistent--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
federal
court
would
have
to
supplement
it
from
some
other
source.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
could
have
minor
variations,
who
are
the
survivors
might
be
different
in
one
state
or
another,
some
might
have
grandmothers
and
some
might
not,
but
this
kind
of
basic
variation
of
the
question
is,
is
it
incompatible
with
the
idea
of
a
recovery
to
have
this
setup
which
says,
you
get...
you
end
up
getting
nothing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
any
other
state
in
the
union
that
has
this
situation
where
the
only
recovery
under
state
law
is
punitive
damages?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
an
alabama
claim
alabama
could
do
whatever
it
wants,
have
a
cap
on
punitives
and
no
cap
on
damages
if
one
survives,
which
i
understand
is
the
law
in
alabama.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ah,
but
we've
already
crossed
that
bridge,
haven't
we,
in
this
series
of
laws?
how
about
1982
and
<nineteen
eighty-three>
[=
1983]
with
respect
to
damages?
1982,
if
i
remember
correctly,
just
speaks
in
terms
of
declaratory
relief,
and
yet
you
can
get
damages
for
a
violation
of
1982,
can't
you?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
right
next
to
1983,
which
says
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
would
be
if
you
take
alabama
law
wholesale.
if
you
could
identify
the
individual
firefighters,
then
you
would
be
subject
to
the
$100,000
cap.
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
on
your
reasoning
i
take
it
there
would
be
no
incompatibility
there.
