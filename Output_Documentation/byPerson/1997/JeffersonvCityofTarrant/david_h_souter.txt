justice
david
h.
souter
are
you
going
to
address
the
jurisdictional
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
think
you
should.
justice
david
h.
souter
why...
you
say
it
frustrates
the
purpose.
a
moment
ago
you
said
the
purpose
is
deterrence,
and
it
certainly
doesn't
frustrate
the
purpose
of
deterrence.
it's
a
classic
example
of
a
deterrent
remedy.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
doesn't
satisfy
it.
i
don't
know
that
it
frustrates
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't
get
to
that,
do
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
don't
get
to
it
because
of
the
federal
rule,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
even
to
the
extent
of
the
deterrence
there
is
a
frustration
of
purpose
here
because
the
punitive
damages
cannot
be
recovered
against
the
municipality.
isn't
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
you
never
get
to
that
limit
because
of
the
effect
of
the
federal
law,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
whether
there
is
a
limit
or
whether
there
isn't
a
limit,
you
can't
get
any
punitive
damages
against
the
municipality--
justice
david
h.
souter
--under
1983,
and
that's
a
matter
of
federal
law,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr....
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
pantazis,
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question
about
where
the
court
in
weeks
got
its
law,
if
i
understand
your
answer,
it
got
its
law
from
sort
of
looking
generally
to
the
common
law
recovery
rules
beyond
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
not
authorized
to
do
that
under
1988,
is
it,
which
refers
to
the
common
law
of
the
state
in
which
the
court
having
jurisdiction
is
held,
so
how
does...
how
did
the
weeks
court
make
this
leap
to
the
rest
of
the
republic?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
know
that
puts
a
block
on
what
it
can
borrow
from
the
state
in
which
it
sits,
but
it
doesn't
function
as
an
affirmative
authorization
to
travel
to
other
states,
does
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
it
federal
common
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
not
borrowing
at
all.
it's
a
fashioning
of
federal
common
law,
pure
and
simple.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
did
we
need
the
1988
provision
in
the
first
place?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
roberts,
you
said
a
second
ago
that
you
can't
separate...
shouldn't
separate
damages
from
remedy.
do
you
mean
you
shouldn't
separate
remedy
from
cause
of
action?
so
that
what
in
effect
you're
arguing
is,
there
isn't
a
general
cause
of
action
here.
what
there
is,
is
a
cause
of
action
for
certain
punitive
damages,
period,
and
that's
the
only
cause
of
action.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
can't
split
the
two
in
that
respect.
justice
david
h.
souter
conceptually
you've
got
to
say
the
only
thing
alabama
allows
here
is
a
punitive
remedy,
in
effect,
period.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
of
course
they
did
not
assume
that
there
could
be
a
separate
concept,
did
they,
of
federal
common
law
at
that
point?
i
mean,
there
was
just
a
generalized
concept
of
common
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
asked
your
brother
a
question
premised
on
exactly
the
opposite
assumption,
but
i
think
i
was
wrong
in
doing
that.
