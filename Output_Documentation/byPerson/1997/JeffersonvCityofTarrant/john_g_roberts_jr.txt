chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
review
the
interlocutory
decision
of
the
alabama
supreme
court.
section
1257
of
the
judicial
code
limits
this
court's
jurisdiction
to
review
state
court
decisions
to
final
judgments.
the
alabama
supreme
court
in
this
case
did
not
issue
a
final
judgment.
it
instead
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
trial
court
for
trial
on
the
state
law
wrongful
death
claim,
which
remains
pending.
this
is
also
not
a
case
of
mere
technical
nonfinality,
nor
is
it
within
any
of
the
cox
exceptions.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
that's
correct.
the
best
that
can
be
said
is--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
the
opposition--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
there
is
not.
the
best
that
can
be
said
is
that
the
opposition
that
was
filed
did
point
out
that
the
decision
was
interlocutory.
it
did
state
that
the
case
was
remanded.
it
did
note
that
the
state
law
claim
remained
pending.
but
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
finality
issue
was
not
argued.
it
is,
however,
of
course,
a
jurisdictional
objection.
as
this
court
indicated
in
flynt
v.
ohio
and
also
in
o'dell
v.
espinoza,
if
there's
a
lack
of
finality
it
goes
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
and
therefore
under
this
court's
rule
15.2
cannot
be
waived.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
there's
no--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--under
the
second
exception
it
necessarily
must
be
the
case
that
the
federal
cause
of
action
would
survive,
and
that's
not
the
case
here,
because
this
pending
state
law
claim
involves
the
same
parties,
and
the
same
underlying
allegations.
under
this
court's
decisions,
that
trial
on
a
decision
on
that
claim
could
well
be
preclusive
of
any
1983
claim,
and
therefore
it
is
not
necessarily
the
case
that
it
would
survive.
it
may
survive,
again
depending
on
the
results
of
the
state
law
proceedings,
which
is
why
it's
not
within
the
third
exception
on
which
my
brother
relied.
the
fact
that
it
may
or
may
not
survive
depending
on
the
outcome
of
the
pending
proceedings
is
why
it
is
not
within
any
of
the
cox
exceptions.
it's
also
not
a
rare
situation.
i
would
suspect
that
in
most
cases
in
which
you
have
1983
claims
they're
joined
with
state
law
claims,
because
conduct
that
violates
section
1983
typically
would
also
violate
some
state
law,
and
most
attorneys
would
bring
both
a
state
law
claim
and
a
federal
claim,
so
if
the
court
creates
a
new
precedent
here,
a
new
exception
to
cox,
it
would
not
be
one
of
limited
applicability,
but
would
apply
broadly
to
a
wide
range
of
1983
cases.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
my
understanding
of
pennsylvania
v.
ritchie,
and
it's
a
very
complicated
case,
but
my
understanding
of
it
was
that
on
the
facts
in
that
case
the
federal
claim
could
not
survive
regardless
of
the
result
on
remand,
which
is
why
it
was
necessary
to
review
it
in
the
interlocutory
posture.
regardless
of
whether
the
petitioner
in
that
case
won
or
lost,
the
federal
claim
would
be
gone,
and
that's
not
the
case
here,
because
the
1983
claim
could
well
survive
the
state
law
proceedings.
it
may
not,
which
is
why
it's
not
within
the
second
exception,
but
it
may,
which
is
why
it's
not
within
the
third.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
how
i
read
it,
your
honor,
because
the
complaint
seeks--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--relief
for
the
injuries
that
the
decedent
suffered.
although
it's
brought
under
what's
called
the
wrongful
death
act
in
alabama,
i
believe
that's
properly
characterized
as
a
survival
action.
if
you're
seeking
relief
for
injuries
to
the
decedent,
it's
survival.
if
you're
seeking
relief
on
your
own
behalf,
it's
a
wrongful
death
action.
this
is
a
survival
action,
as
i
understand
it.
it
was
brought
by
the
representative
of
the
estate.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
under
the
wrongful
death
action,
although
again
i
think
it's
properly
classified
as
a
survival
claim,
and
the...
must
be
brought
by
the
representative
of
the
estate,
and
they're
entitled
to
punitive
damages
to
punish
the
wrongful
death
of
the
decedent.
alabama's
view
is
that
you
cannot
compensate
the
dead,
and
from
the
beginning...
it's
a
very
old
statute,
almost
going
back
as
far
as
lord
campbell's
act...
they've
recognized
that
it's
punitive
in
nature.
it's
brought
to
punish.
it's
original
title
was
an
act
to
prevent
homicide,
and
they've
adhered
to
that
interpretation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right.
this
court's
decision
in
fact
concerts
means
that
you
can't
recover
that,
and
that
poses...
if
we
reach
the
merits
that
poses
the
issue,
is
that
alabama
rule
inconsistent
with
federal
law?
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yeah.
it
is
a
dilemma,
but
we
think
the
alabama
supreme
court
reached
the
correct
result.
under
robertson
v.
wegman
you
look
to
the
whether
the
policies
under
1983,
compensation.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that's
the
most
likely
one.
i
suppose
there
could
be
some
argument,
even
if
they
lose
on
the
state
law
claim,
that
it
shouldn't
for
some
reason
or
another
be
given
collateral
estoppel
effect.
i
don't...
i
can't
at
this
point--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
that's
right,
yes.
i
think
that's
right.
it
would
be
precluded
because
the
1983
claim
is,
just
from
a
reading
of
the
complaint
is
based
on
the
same
underlying
allegations.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
yes.
yes,
and
if
they--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
of
course,
unless...
my
brother
pointed
out
they
would
have
to
go
through
the
perhaps
futile
exercise
of
preserving
the
claim
before
the
alabama
supreme
court,
but
that's
true
in
every
case
of
nonfinality.
you
can
expect
that
the
court
that
has
already
decided
the
federal
issue
will
most
likely
adhere
to
its
position.
if
that
were
enough
to
get
it
outside
the
finality
rule
there
would
be
no
finality
rule,
because
that's
true
in
every
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
recognized
what
some
have
said
a
more
pragmatic
approach,
but
my
point
is
that
this
is
not
within
any
of
those
exceptions,
largely
because
the
underlying
claim
that
still
remains
alive,
although
a
state
law
claim,
is
based
on
the
same
underlying
allegations
and
it
involves
the
same
parties.
it
could
well
have
an
effect
on
whether
the
federal
claim
survives.
turning
back
again
to
the
merits
in
robertson
v.
wegman,
the
policies
of
1983
are
compensation
and
deterrence.
there
is
no
adverse
impact
on
1983's
compensation
policy
in
this
case
for
the
reason
recognized
in
robertson,
that
when
the
only
claim
for
compensation
is
by
the
representative
of
the
estate,
that
compensation
interest
is
not
duplicated.
the
reality
is,
you
cannot
compensate
the
dead.
alabama
law--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
robertson
there
were
no
immediate
relatives.
survivor
was
limited
to
parent,
child,
or
siblings,
and
there
were
none
of
those,
but
it's...
the
language
about
the
compensation
policy
not
being
implicated
was
not
based
on
any
finding
that
there
were
no
heirs,
legatees,
other
ancestors
or
descendants,
though
not
within
the
narrow
category.
it
was
simply
based
on
the
fact
that
the
claim
was
brought
by
the
representative
of
the
estate
and
therefore,
as
the
complaint
in
this
case,
looked
to
the
injuries
that
the
decedent
suffered.
it
recognized
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--justice
marshall's
opinion
did
point
out
that
this
was
peculiar
in
the
sense
that
the
decedent,
mr.
shaw,
was
not
survived
by
parent,
child,
or
sibling.
that
was
what
louisiana
limited
survivorship
to.
but
it
was
not
the
case
that
there
was
any
finding
that
he
had
no
heirs
at
all,
that
he
didn't
have
a
will...
the
case
was
brought
after
all
by
his
executor...
that
there
was
nobody
who
stood
to
inherit
if,
in
fact,
he
could
get
damages,
but
the
court
said
the
compensation
interest
is
not
implicated
because
the
person
on
whose
behalf
you're
suing
as
representative
of
the
estate
cannot
be
compensated.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it
would
depend
under
what
guise.
certainly
if
the
state
had
a
rule
there
are
no
punitive
damages--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
1983
even
against
individuals,
i
would
agree
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
federal
law.
but
if
it
was
a
more
narrowly
applicable
rule,
for
example--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
that
question,
although
it
was
adverted
to
earlier,
is
not
before
the
court
today.
the
alabama
supreme
court
did
not
address--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--even
if
you
view
it
as
a
damage
issue,
the
validity
of
state
caps
on
wrongful
death
recovery
and
whether
they're
overridden
by
1983
is
a
difficult
issue.
it's
a
different
one
than
the
one
before
the
court
today,
and
it
has
to
be
informed
by,
for
example,
the
fact
that
in
1871
many
states
had
such
caps.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
congress,
when
it
passed
the
one
wrongful
death
provision
it
did
pass
in
the
civil
rights
act
in
1986
imposed
a
cap.
those
are
different
questions,
whether
the
separate
alabama
cap
applies.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
it
is,
the
same
rule
is
applicable
as
a
general
matter,
but
not
with
respect
to
the
wrongful
death
or
survival
question,
because
1983
doesn't
address
that
more
narrow
category,
what
are
the
appropriate...
what
is
the
appropriate
relief,
if
any,
in
a
wrongful
death
or
survival
case.
yes,
if
a
state
law
purported
to
bar
recovery
of
compensatory
damages
in
a
normal
1983
case
we
would...
the
court
should
find
that
inconsistent
with
1983,
but
it's
difficult
to
argue
that
a
state
limitation
on
recovery
in
a
wrongful
death
action
or
a
survival
action
is
inconsistent
with
1983,
when
1983
has
no
survival
or
wrongful
death
provision.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
you
can
sever
the
damages
from
the
remedy
under
the
alabama
regime.
alabama
has
provided
a
wrongful
death
remedy
for
punitive
damages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
can
sort
of
pick
and
choose
which
aspects
of
the
alabama
remedy
it
wants
to
incorporate,
saying
we're
going
to
incorporate
the
fact
that
you
allow
a
wrongful
death
action,
but
we're
not
going
to
take
the
only
way
you
allow
it,
which
is
for
punitive
damages.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
it--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
is
the
approach
of
the
court.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
we
do
think
that's
wrong,
and
we
also
think
it's
inapplicable
even
in
this
case,
because
the
one
thing
the
court
did
in
weeks
is
say,
you
get
no
recovery
for
injuries
to
the
decedent,
because
we're
going
to
give
you
wrongful
death...
we're
going
to
measure
compensation
based
on
your
loss
as
a
survivor.
then
you
don't
get
any
recovery
for
losses
to
the
decedent.
here,
the
only
claims
that
are
sought
are
what
are
technically
survival
claims
for
injuries
to
the
decedent,
so
even
under
the
approach
in
weeks
there
would
be
no
recovery
in
this
case.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
that's
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right,
and,
of
course,
it's
not
an
approach
that
it's
adopted
in
any
way
discriminatory
to
1983
or
this
court's
decisions.
it
adopted
this
rule
long
before
anyone
thought
municipalities
could
be
liable
for
anything
under
section
1983.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
in
the...
there
are
references,
of
course,
in
the
legislative
history
of
1983
to
murders,
lynchings,
and
of
course
congress
did
provide
remedies
for
those
in
the
civil
rights
act.
there's
a
specific
remedy
in
section
1986
which
allows
a
cause
of
action
for
the
widow
or
next
of
kin.
there
is
a
criminal
provision
now
codified
at
section
242
which
could
also
be
invoked
in
cases
of
murder,
and
there
was
1988
which
says,
look
to
state
law
to
fill
gaps
in
this
remedial
program
and,
to
the
extent
states
allowed
survival
or
wrongful
death
actions,
perhaps
the
congress
thought
that
those
would
be
invoked
to
recover
in
those
situations.
most
states
had
survival
and
wrongful
death
provisions
when
1983
was
enacted.
i
think
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
says,
if
the
laws
of
the
united
states
are
deficient,
you
look
to
the
common
law
as
modified.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
but
it's
the
common
law
as
modified
by
the
statutes
of
the
forum
state,
and
my
understanding
is
that
if
it's--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
in
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
whether
it
was
federal
common...
whether
it
was
federal
common
law
or
state
common
law,
it
was
unambiguous
that
in
the
absence
of
legislative
change
there
was
no
recovery
in
the
case
of
wrongful
death.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no,
not
at
all,
and
this
court
recognized
in
the
brame
case
6
years
after
1983
was
passed
that
at
the
common
law...
and
it
didn't
differentiate
between
state
or
federal,
but
at
the
common
law
they
thought
it
was
beyond
question
that
there
was
no
wrongful
death
or
survival
action.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
at
the
time
the
decisions
recognized...
they
didn't
break
it
down
as
federal
common
law
and
state
common
law...
that
there
were
some
issues
that
would
be
governed
by
the
common
law,
more
local
issues--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--and
under
1988
it
was
applicable
unless
modified
by
the
statutes...
now,
here,
of
course--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes,
because
it
incorporates...
it
doesn't
stay
frozen--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--at
the
time.
now,
the
other
prong
under
robertson
v.
wegman
they
ask,
what
is
the
effect
on
deterrence,
and
here
again
there's
no
adverse
effect
on
1983's
deterrence
policy
by
application
of
the
alabama
law.
to
find
an
adverse
effect,
the
court
has
to
hypothesize
a
city
employee
who
is
familiar
with
the
intricacies
of
the
wrongful
death
law
and
1983
law
and
who,
solely
to
avoid
subjecting
his
employer
to
liability
under
1983
for
compensatory
damages,
would
kill
rather
than
injure
the
victim
of
his
constitutional
violation
even
though--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
fact
that
you
get
a
different
result
from
state
to
state,
as
this
court
recognized
in
robertson,
is,
of
course,
a
necessary
consequence
of
the
terms
of
1988.
it
says
that
you're...
if
you're
borrowing
state
law.
you're
necessarily
contemplating
that
there
may
be
a
different
result
in
one
state
than
in
another
state,
and
the
court
reiterated
that
point
in
carlson
v.
green
in
distinguishing
the
remedy
it
was
creating
there.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
it
begs
the
question
to
say
that
1983
assumes
there's
going
to
be
recovery
in
cases
of
survival
and
wrongful
death.
198--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--massachusetts
used
to
have
that
rule.
it
changed
it.
at
this
point
alabama
is
the
only
state
that
remedies
wrongful
death
through
punitive
damages
alone.
that
doesn't
make
it
an
illegitimate
policy,
based
on
the--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
only
way
to
have
a
survival
or
wrongful
death
cause
of
action
under
1983
is
by
incorporating
the
state
law,
because
when
1983
was
passed
there
was
no
survival
or
wrongful
death
at
common
law.
the
congress
knew
that
if
it
wanted
to
create
an
exception
to
that
it
had
to
be
done
legislatively,
as
it
had
been
in
lord
campbell's
act,
as
that
congress
did
in
section
1986.
the
opinion,
justice
ginsburg,
you
announced
this
morning
indicated...
and
i'm
going
just
on
the
basis
of
the
announcement...
that
when
congress
in
the
same
statute
provides
a
remedy
in
one
section
and
not
in
the
other,
you
don't
assume
that--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
believe
so,
yes.
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
but
here
you're
talking
about
an
exception
to
the
prevailing
common
law
rule,
and
when
you
have
a
narrow
exception
in
one
section,
i
think
the
only
logical
inference
is
that
congress
did
not
intend
it
in
the
other
section.
there
was
no
doubt
congress
knew
what
the
prevailing
law
was,
no
recovery
for
survival
or
wrongful
death.
the
most
that
can
be
said
is
that
they
would
give
you
that
right
if
you
had
one
under
state
law.
1988
would
provide
it.
here,
alabama
does
provide
such
a
right,
and
it
doesn't
leave
them
with
no
remedy.
under
the
alabama
rule
you
still
have
a
remedy
under
1983
applying
the
alabama
rule
against
individuals,
and
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
in
robertson,
in
carlson,
and
in
fact
concerts,
that
the
most
effective
deterrent
is
an
action
against
the
individuals.
in
fact,
the
situation--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh
yes,
and
again,
i
don't
think
that
issue
is
before
the
court
because
the
only...
because
that's
not
part
of
the
wrongful
death
statute.
those
are
general--
chief
justice
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
not,
largely
because
at
the
time
1982
was
passed
many
states...
i'm
not
sure
if
there
was
quite
a
majority
or
not,
but
many
had
such
caps.
congress
put
a
cap
in
in
the
only
wrongful
death
provision
it
provided
in
1986.
the
situation
in
alabama
under
the
wrongful
death
act
is
quite
similar
to
the
situation
this
court
has
formulated
under
bivens.
we
know
from
fdic
v.
myer
that
you
have
a
bivens
action
against
federal
officials,
the
individuals,
but
no
bivens
action
against
the
agency.
here,
applying
the
alabama
wrongful
death
act
you
have
a
1983
action
in
the
case
of
wrongful
death
in
alabama
against
individuals
for
punitive
damages,
but
you
do
not
have
one
against
the
municipality.
thank
you,
your
honor.
