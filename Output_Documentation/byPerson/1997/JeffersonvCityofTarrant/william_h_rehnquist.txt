chief
justice

h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-957,
melvin
jefferson
v.
the
city
of
tarrant,
alabama.
mr.
pantazis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
perhaps
the
rationale
of
section
3
was
your...
a
case
called
california
v.
stewart
that
was
decided
on...
where
the
state
court
says,
this
evidence
is
inadmissible
because
it
was
violative
of
miranda.
the
state
wants
to
appeal
that.
if
it
goes
back
to
the
trial
court,
the
state
is
prevented
from
getting
that
evidence
in,
so
it's
lost
forever
the
right
to
review
that
claim
because
the
trial
court
won't
accept
it,
and
if
there's
a
guilty
verdict,
or
a
not
guilty
verdict,
the
state
never
will
have
an
opportunity
to
review
it.
you,
on
the
other
hand,
will,
as
my
colleagues
have
pointed
out,
have...
could
have
an
opportunity
to
have
this
reviewed
in
a
later
proceeding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let's
assume
that,
as
i
think
my
colleagues
have
assumed,
that
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
is
going
to
say,
as
justice
ginsburg,
this
is
the
law
of
the
case,
we've
decided
it,
but
this
is
simply
a
necessary
step
for
you
to
then
bring
the
case
to
us,
and
you
will
not
have
the
final
judgment
argument
made
against
you
at
that
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
don't
claim
an
independent
federal
basis
for
challenging
the
$100,000
limit
on
punitive
damages
for
wrongful
death
in
alabama
if
it
didn't
involve
a
federal
claim,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
exactly,
do
you
mean
yes
or
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
would
the
district
court
get
its
law
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
you
say
is
the
source
from
which
the
district
court
obtained
it?
it
just
polled
the
various
states
and
decided
what
was
the
common
denominator.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
district
court
say
where
it
got
its
law
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
asking
you
to--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--examine
the
judge's
mind.
does
the
opinion
say
where--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
wish
to
reserve
the
rest
of
your
time,
mr.
pantazis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
swift
v.
tyson
didn't
cover
statutes,
did
it?
i
mean,
if
you
had
to
have
a
statute
for
a
wrongful
death
or
a
survival
recovery,
that
wasn't
something
that
the
federal
courts
just
undertook
to
provide
for
themselves.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
mr.
pantazis,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pantazis.
the
case
is
submitted.
