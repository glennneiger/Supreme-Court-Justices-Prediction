justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
quite
wrong.
the
decedent's
damages
would
go
to
her
estate.
the
wrongful
death
action
is
brought
on
behalf
of
the
relatives
and
third
parties.
you're
just
asking
for
the
latter?
your
complaint
seems
to
cover
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
would
you
limit
yourself
to
one
rather
than
both?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
not
in
the
normal
survival
action.
the
money
goes
into
the
estate
and,
of
course,
whoever
is
the
beneficiary
of
the
estate
gets
the
money,
but
that's
analytically
quite
distinct
from
a
death
action
brought
on
behalf
of
the
survivors.
i
don't...
i...
if
you
want
to
limit
yourself
to
one,
that's
your
privilege,
of
course.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
this
question
as
a
matter
of
alabama
law?
suppose
you
had
a
single
person
who
was
90
years
old,
and
a
millionaire,
no
relatives
at
all.
the
person
is
seriously
injured
and
runs
up
$500,000
in
hospital
expenses
and
then
dies.
can
the
administrator
of
that
person's
estate
recover
a
dime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
have
to...
is
there
any
provision
under
alabama
law
for
the
estate
to
recover
anything
for
that
person?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
knew
alabama
had
its
idiosyncracies,
but
this
is
really
surprising.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no
heirs
in
my
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
she
had
left
a
will
leaving
everything
to
alabama
university,
or
something
like
that,
but
alabama
university
would
get
nothing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
are
no
heirs
in
my
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
may
i
just
go
back
to
the
final
judgment
question
for
a
minute
to
be
sure
i
have
it
in
mind.
it
is
your
view...
is
it
your
view
that
the
only
possibility
for
a
second
shot
at
the
federal
claim
will
arise
if
the
plaintiff
prevails
on
the
state
law
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
then
your
point...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
have
it
fairly
in
mind.
your
point
is
that
even
though
the
denial
of
a
federal
claim
is
the
law
of
the
case
as
far
as
alabama
courts
are
concerned,
and
there's
virtually...
there's
always
the
possibility,
but
there's...
it's
already
been
decided.
the
case
would
still
be
alive,
so
the
plaintiff
could
come
back
here
and
make
the
same
argument
he's
making
today.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
think
that's
enough
to...
that's
enough
not
to
come
within
any
of
the
cox
exceptions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
cox
did
cut
way
back
on
what
the
finality
rule
had
been
before,
of
course.
but
anyway--
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
can
i
ask
just
a
little
more
basic
question?
would
you
agree
that
the
question
whether
punitive
damages
are
available
in
the
1983
case
is
a
federal
question,
and
that's
what
both
smith
v.
wade
and
fact
concerts
decide,
so
that
if
a
state
denied
a
punitive
damage
remedy
1983
would
trump
the
state
denial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
just
asking
broadly.
in
other
words,
if
it
were
just
a
damage
question
in
this
case,
the
federal
law
would
trump
the
state,
contrary
state
law.
if
it
was...
for
example,
years
ago
there
used
to
be,
in
the
wrongful
death
field
there
would
be
a
$10,000
limit
on
recovery.
if
the
state
had
such
a
limit
on
recovery,
do
you
think
that
would
defeat
a
larger
recovery
for...
in
the
1983
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
a
question
whether
it's
before
the
court
as
to
whether
one
views
this
as
a
damage
issue
or
a
question
of
standing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
okay.
but
if
you
would
agree
that
on
the
issue
of
punitive
damages
federal
law
would
trump
the
state
law
whichever
way
it
went...
here
it's
kind
of
perverse...
why
isn't
the
same
rule
appropriate
for
compensatory
damages,
that
if
a
state
denies
compensatory
damages
and
the
federal
law
generally
allows
it,
why
wouldn't
the
state...
federal
law
trump
it
there--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--just
as
it
would
in
reverse,
if
a
state
granted
it
and...
you
couldn't
say...
anyway,
go
ahead.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
alabama
has
provided
a
remedy
that's
just
some...
but
the
damages
it
provided
are
unavailable,
but
the...
if
the
fact
concert
had
been
decided
the
other
way,
the
plaintiff
would
prevail.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
provided
a
wrongful
death
remedy
for
administrators
of
estates
like
this,
but
it
does
not
allow
damages.
that's
the
one
thing
it
doesn't
do.
it
doesn't
allow
the
damages
that
would
normally
be
recoverable
in
a
1983.
it
allows
the
party
to
sue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
roberts,
it
was
neither
state
nor
federal.
the
common
law
was
this
mystical
concept
we
inherited
from
england.
it
was
english
common
law,
was
what
that
term
would
normally
refer
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
mr.
roberts,
that
if
there
was
no
survival
statute
or
wrongful
death
statute
in
a
state,
a
particular
state
in
1871,
and
they
pass
it
in
1890,
that
would
nevertheless
control
in
cases
after
1890?
justice
john
paul
stevens
modified
from
time
to
time.
