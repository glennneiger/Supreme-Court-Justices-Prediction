the
problem
is
that's
always
true
when
you
take
an
interlocutory
appeal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
always
true,
so
the
statutes
balance
and
allow
you
sometimes
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal,
sometimes
not,
but
we
have
a
statute
here
that
doesn't
allow
it.
it
says
final,
and
is
there
anyway
around
that?
i
mean,
i
don't
see...
the
word
is
final.
it
doesn't
allow
this
interlocutory
thing
to
come
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
do
we
get
around
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
but
how
could...
i
mean,
it's
like
a
trial
judge.
the
trial
judge
makes
a
ruling
against
you
at
the
beginning
of
the
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
run
up
to
the
court
of
appeals,
you
say,
you
know,
judge,
an
awful
lot
of
time
and
effort's
going
to
go
by.
why
don't
you
and
the
court
of
appeals
reverse
him
now?
and
if
we
have
a
statute
that
says
final,
we
can't
do
it.
we
have
to
look
to
some
other
statute
that
gave
us
the
interlocutory
right,
or
that
gave
us,
you
know,
the
certificating
right.
we
couldn't
do
it
on
a
word
that
says
final.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
the
dilemma,
it
seems
to
me,
here.
i'm
putting
that
because
maybe
you
can
think
of
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
what
it
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
like
a...
is...
there
is
no
doctrine
here
like
waiver,
because
this
particular
argument
i
don't
think
was
raised
in
the
petitioner's
reply...
you
were
not
the
lawyer
then,
but
the
response--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
petition
for
cert,
it
didn't
raise
this
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it
had
we
might
have
caught
it,
but
it
didn't,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
there
any
waiver
principle
or
anything
in--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
come
across
any
historical...
i'm
just
curious
historically.
probably
in
1880
or
sometime
like
that,
there
probably
were
quite
a
few
states
that
said
what
alabama
says
basically.
a
person
who
dies
loses
whatever
tort
actions
that
person
may
have
had
before
the
person
died.
that
was
probably
the
basic
rule.
once
you
die,
they're
gone.
if
you
didn't
bring
them,
it's
too
late.
and
there
probably
were
a
lot
of
states
that
hadn't
passed
survivorship
actions,
statutes,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
names
get
us
mixed
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
a
survival
statute
for
any
tort,
or
certain
tort
claims.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
probably
were
quite
a
few
that
hadn't.
what
were
the
people
thinking
when
they
passed
1983?
i
mean,
they
were
worried
about,
say,
like
the
local
sheriff
in
the
south
might
murder
somebody,
or
might
beat
him
up,
and
what
were
they
thinking?
they
were
thinking
that
we
give
a
cause
of
action
to
people
when
they're
beaten
up
but
we
don't
give
a
cause
of
action
to
people
when
they're
murdered.
that
would
be
such
an
obvious
question
that
maybe
somebody
thought
about
that
and
talked
about
it.
was
there
anything
historically
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
i
wonder...
it
says
the
common
law,
too,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
maybe
it
meant
that
there
was
federal
common
law
at
that
time.
it
would
have
been
smith
v.
tyson.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
would
be
no
modification
in
a
state
that
hadn't
passed
a
survival
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
wouldn't
be
an
issue
of
the
common
law
as
modified.
it
would
be
a
question
of
the
common
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
which
time
they
might
have
thought
federal
common
law,
or
is
that...
that's--
