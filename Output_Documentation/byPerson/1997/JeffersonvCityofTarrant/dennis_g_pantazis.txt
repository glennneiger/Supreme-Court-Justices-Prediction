mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
held
there
is
no
section
42
u.s.c.
section
1983
claim
for
a
cause
of
action
if
the
victim
dies
from
the
perpetration
of
the
act.
the
issue
before
this
court
is,
when
the
decedent's
death
results
from
the
deprivation
of
a
federal
right
occurring
in
alabama,
does
the
wrongful
death
act
govern
the
recovery
of
the
decedent's
estate?
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
i
will,
if...
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
the
federal
issue
has
been
totally
adjudicated
by
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
and
under
the
cox
case
this
court
has
held
an
exception,
or
held
that
jurisdiction
is
found
where
there's
no
further
federal
issue
to
be
adjudicated
and
cannot
be
adjudicated
at
the
lower
court.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
under...
in
cox
it's
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is
that
the
court
held
this
exception:
where
the
federal
claim
has
been
finally
decided
and
with
further
proceeding
on
the
merits
in
the
state
court
to
come,
but
that
which
later
review
of
the
federal
issue
cannot
be
had,
whatever
the
ultimate
outcome
of
the
case.
that
was
the
third
exception.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
i
don't
believe
so.
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
already
adjudicated
that
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
i
think
it
is
different,
but
i
think
the
rational
of
cox
is,
looking
at
this
particular
issue,
this
court...
the
alabama
supreme
court
has
adjudicated
it
to
the
fullest
degree
under
the
federal
issue.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
it
would
require
duplication
in
trying
the
case
twice,
and
i
think
that's
part
of
the
rationale
that
cox
looked
at.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
it
could,
but
the
problem,
your
honor,
is
that
the
third
element
in
cox
specifically,
i
think,
addressed
that
rationale.
it
said
that
the
federal
claim
was
adjudicated
in
the
federal...
in
the
state
court.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well,
i
think,
though,
the
rationale
in
exception
3,
if
it
does
not
meet
this
case,
it
should
meet
this
case,
and
maybe
the
court
should
accept
that
as
a
further--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--i
think
that,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
do
not
believe
that
we
will,
because
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
reviewed
the
issue
and
has
accepted
it
for
that
particular
purpose.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
if
that
rationale
holds,
then
this
case
would
be
tried
once
with
a
state
remedy,
which
would
exclude
the
entire
1983
cause
of
action.
it
would
then
go
up
before
the
supreme
court
of
alabama,
and
they,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
would
probably
say,
we've
already
covered
this,
you
know,
the
issue
is
moot,
and
we'd
be
here
again
2
or
3
years
on
the
same
issue,
having
gone
through
the
system
without
any...
moving
the
case
any
further.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
that's
true.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
that's
true.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--i
personally
do
not
believe
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
will
adjudicate
the
same
federal
issue
again,
and
the
reason
is
the
defendants
in
this
case
are
going
to
say,
this
case
is
already
decided.
that
was
already
addressed.
the
parties
were
before
it.
it
was
a
final
order
on
the
1983
issue.
that's
over
with.
and
i--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--the
state
claims
are.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
i
believe
the
court
could
expand,
if
that's
the
term,
in
the
cox
rationale
and
to
allow
this
particular
appeal.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
yes.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
right.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--the
difference
in
that
is
that
if
it
is
an
issue,
an
evidentiary
issue
or
something,
it
would
be
adjudicated
and
revisited
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
as
all
evidentiary
issues.
the
issue
of
whether
you
have
a
cause
of
action
has
reached
the
highest
level
it
can
reach
in
alabama,
and
it
has
been
adjudicated
at
the
highest
level
it
can
reach
within
the
alabama
system,
and
that
issue
has
been
taken
care
of
both
from
a
fact
standpoint
and
from
a
representation
of
the
parties,
and
i
don't
believe
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
can
go
back
and
review
it.
it's
already
said,
i've
made
that
decision
on
that
issue.
i
think
that
we
would
be--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--they
possibly
could
do
that,
your
honor,
but
in...
because
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
ruled
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
pleadings...
this
was
not
a
summary
judgment.
it
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
pleadings...
it
dismissed
the
counts
in
this
case
that
involved
1983,
and
they're
forever
gone,
and
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
ruled
that
issue
finality.
those
issues
are
no
longer
present
in
the
state
court
and
in
the
trial
court.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
i
would
think
not,
and
the
reason
is
because
the
state
measure
of
damages
in
alabama
for
wrongful
death
is
the
wrongfulness
of
the
conduct
of
the
defendant.
it
is
not
compensatory.
it
is
purely
punitive,
and
if...
1983
against
municipalities
is
compensatory
damages
only.
there
is
no
compensatory
damages
for
wrongful
death.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well,
the
issues
that
would
be
tried
in
the
case
in
the...
for
the
wrongful
death,
the
issues
and
the
evidence
and
even
the
measure
of
damages,
what
the
jury
is
allowed
to
consider,
would
totally
be
different.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
the
conduct--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--it
may
not,
your
honor.
it
may...
a
lot
of
it
would
parallel,
but
a
lot
of
it...
there's
also
issues
that
would
be
allowable
in
'83
from
an
evidentiary
standpoint
that
wouldn't
be
allowable
or
relevant
just
for
a
wrongful
death
case.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
okay.
it
is
fun.
[laughter]
your
honor,
this
case
involves
a
lady
who
was
an
elderly
black
lady
in
tarrant,
alabama.
she
died
in
a
fire.
she
had
both
legs
amputated
previously.
she
died
when
her
husband...
when
the
house
caught
on
fire
and
her
husband
tried
to
pull
her
to
a
first
floor
window,
could
not
get
her
out.
the
firefighters
of
tarrant
city
arrived.
on
two
requests
he
asked
them
to
pull
her
out.
on
both
requests,
two
different
firefighters,
they
both
refused.
his
son
and
her
son
approached,
and
got
there.
when
he
did,
he
pulled
her
out.
she
was
laying
on
the
ground.
they
refused
to
administer
any
first
aid.
they
refused
to
even
take
her
pulse.
the
allegations
in
the
complaint,
and
as
the
record
reflects,
this
was
a
custom
and
practice
of
depriving
black
citizens
in
tarrant,
alabama
of
fundamental
equal
protection
rights
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
we
had
filed
a
section
1983
cause
of
action,
and
as
this
court
knows,
section
1983
does
not
provide
a
remedy,
remedial
damage
remedy
under
that
section.
we
have
to
look
for
guidance
to
1988.
1988
tells
us
that
we
look
first,
or
consider
first
the
state
common
law
and
state
statutory
law,
and
if
that
is
not
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
and
policy
of
the
federal
constitution,
the
united
states
laws
it's
intended
to
protect,
then
we
apply
it,
but
if
it
is,
that
is
the
balancing
test,
or
that
is
the
test
that
the
courts
must
look
at.
this
court
in
robertson
v.
wegman
has
held
that
the
purpose
and
policy
of
1983
is
to
compensate
and
to
prevent
prevention
of
abuses
and
power
by
those
acting
under
color
of
state
law,
or
in
my
words,
deterrence,
and
if
you
apply
that
standard
to
what
we
have
in
alabama,
or
we're
left
with
in
alabama...
because
what's
left
are
two
state
statutes.
one
of
them
is
the
wrongful
death
statute,
which
is
cited
at
6-5-410,
and
as
i've
indicated
is
purely
compensatory.
even
the
supreme
court's
decision
in
this
case
states
that,
i
think,
in
the
first
or
second
paragraph...
excuse
me.
it's
purely
punitive.
i
said
compensatory.
i
misstated.
it's
purely
punitive,
and
the
jury
charges,
they're
admonished
never
to
consider
any
compensatory
aspects,
just
punitive,
it
certainly
frustrates
the
purpose
of
compensation.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
that's
correct,
it
does
satisfy
the
second
element
of
deterrence,
but
it
frustrates
the
first
element
of
underlying
policy
of
compensation.
there
is
a
second
statute
that
comes
into
play.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well,
it
runs
in
conflict
with
it,
your
honor.
there's
a
second
statute
that
frustrates
both,
is
inconsistent
with
both
policies,
and
that
is
section
11-93-2,
which
arbitrarily
places
a
limit
of
$100,000
on
any
recovery
against
a
municipality,
which
would
apply
in
this
case
with
no
1983
cause
of
action.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
we
do--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--well,
if
we
have
no
83
claim,
as
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
said,
it's
all
state.
the
supreme
court
did
not
modify
its
wrongful
death--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--that
is...
that
is
an
argument.
we
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
because
it's
purely
punitive,
that
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
compensatory
aspects,
while
it
may
comply
with
the
deterrence.
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
has
said
that
in
removing
the
1983
action,
and
that's
what
it
did,
it
dismissed
it,
said
that
we
are
now
under
the
wrongful
death.
while
we're
under
that
statute,
we're
also
under
the
statute
that
arbitrarily
limits
us
to
$100,000
damages,
and
that
frustrates
both
deterrence
as
well
as
compensation.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--well--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--i
disagree,
and
the
reason
i
disagree
is,
the
supreme
court
said
there
is
no
83
claim,
so
we're
not
under
any
federal
law
for
this
case,
as
it
sits
now
at
the
trial
level.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
exactly,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
yes.
i
do
not
challenge
it.
i
agree
with
your
statement.
i
do
not
challenge
it
because
what
we're
saying
is,
if
we
have
a
1983
claim,
then
the
limitation
would
not
apply,
and
that's
why
it's
so
important
that
this
court
consider
and
instruct
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
our
1983
claim
is
not
satisfied
by
the
alabama
wrongful
death
statute,
because
if
it
does
apply,
if
we
have
an
83
claim,
the
arbitrary
caps
do
not
apply.
if
we
don't
have
an
83
claim,
if
the
case
is
as
it's
left
right
now,
without
any
reference
to
1983,
then
all
of
the
state
laws
would
apply,
and
we
would
have
a
purely
punitive
remedy
and
a
$100,000--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--your
honor,
we're
asking
for
the
wrongful
death
statute
to
compensate
the
estate.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
we
are
asking
for
the
damages
as
listed
in
the
weeks
case,
which
was
a
district
court
case
in
alabama,
which
did
say
that
the
estate's
damages
are
the
measure
of
the
pain
and
suffering,
the
funeral
expenses
of
the
decedent's
heirs,
or
the
descendents,
and
that
is
what
we
think
the
typical
compensatory
damage
is
that
is
encompassed
in
49
states.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
no.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
if
the
complaint
reads
that
way,
that
may
be
an
inartful
pleading,
but
we're
asking
that
the
court
compensate
the
estate,
and
in
compensating
the
estate,
the
court
look
at
traditional
compensation
measures
for
wrongful
death,
which,
like
we've
indicated,
48
or
49
states...
the
only
one
i'm
unsure
of
is
massachusetts...
have
held
that
when
you
compensate
for
death,
the
beneficiaries
or
the
descendents
are
the
ones
whose...
are
the
ones
who
suffer
the
loss
and
suffer
the
pain
and
also
pay
the
medical
bills
and
pay
the
funeral
expenses.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
i
believe,
your
honor,
the
damages
go
to
the
decedent's
estate.
that's
the
only...
the
wrongful
death
damages
or
the
1983
damages
would
go
to
the
estate,
and
would
be
passed--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--well,
we
are--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--well,
we
are
asking
for
both,
but
the
way
you
compensate
a
decedent
for
death
in
reality,
and
what
most
of
the
states
have
done,
is
by
compensating
the
heirs
for
what
they
have
lost,
or
the
descendents
for
what
they
have
lost.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--under
the
alabama
wrongful
death
statute
it
goes
directly
to
the
descendents
and
not
attached
by
debts.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
the
only...
if
you're
speaking
of
a
federal
remedy,
that
would
be
correct,
but
the
only
remedy
we
have
in
alabama
is
the
wrongful
death,
which
would
not
allow
that
under
alabama
common
law,
statutory
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
no.
the
proceeds
are...
the
estate
bring...
is
the
property
party
to
bring
the
cause
of
action,
the
personal
representative
through
the
estate,
but
the
damages
go
directly
to
the
descendents,
and
in
weeks
the
court
analysized
that
the
compensatory
aspect
of
1983
is
to
compensate
the
decedent
by
the
measure
of
damages
that
the
descendents
had
suffered,
and
pay
the...
through
that
proceeds,
through
that
process.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
it's
the
only
remedy
available.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
that
happens
often,
your
honor,
that
the
administrator
is
in
conflict
with
the
heirs.
what
we're
asking
is
that
this
court
instruct
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
the
19...
that
there
cannot
abolish
the
1983
action,
because
in
doing
so
it
directly
is
inconsistent
with
the
purpose
of
compensation
and
deterrence
and,
in
doing
so,
we're
asking
this
court
to
instruct
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
that
the
1983
cause
of
action
is
supplemental
to
the
wrongful
death
statute,
and
that
the
damages
that
are
allowable
under
1983
are
those
typical
compensatory
damages
that
are
found
in
48
or
49
other
states.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
we
ask
that
the
court
use
the
rationale
that
has
been
decided
or
looked
at
in
the
weeks
case,
the
district
court
case
in
alabama,
and
if
i
may
i'll
quote
that
section.
it's
page
1309
of
that
decision.
it
says,
the
compensatory
damage
award
shall
be
measured
by
the
losses
incurred
by
the
descendent
survivors,
who
are
entitled
to
recover
under
alabama
statute
of
distribution
as
a
result
of
the
death.
such
losses
may
include
but
are
not
restricted
to
expenses
incurred
in
the
treatment
of
or
burial
of
the
descendent,
loss
of
income
from
the
descendent,
loss
of
companionship
and
consortium,
pain
and
suffering
of
the
survivors.
this
particular
case,
the
weeks
case,
was
brought
simply
on
the
claim
of
the
executor
of
the
estate.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
these
type
of
damages
are
what
most
of
the
state
statutes
hold
as
compensatory
damages
in
wrongful
death,
the
typical--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--the
briefs
in
the
district
court
case
did
have...
i
mean,
there
are
several
cases
that
they
looked
at.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
the
district
court...
i'm
only
familiar
with
this...
the
opinion
does
not.
i'm
familiar
with
it,
but--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--right.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
the
opinion
does
not.
i
am
aware
that
the
briefs
filed
in
this
case
show
typical
compensatory
damages
that
are
found
in
other
states.
alabama
happens
to
be
an
unusual
animal,
to
say
the
least,
on
wrongful
death.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
on
the
wrongful
death?
no.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
no,
and
it
gets
even
worse
than
that,
your
honor,
if
i
could
explain.
the
measure
of
damages--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--the--
[laughter]
the
damages
would
go
directly
to
the
heirs.
it
would
not
even
pass
through
the
estate.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well,
then
there
would
be
nobody
getting...
there
would
be
somebody.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
the
will...
the
will
wouldn't
apply.
it
would
go
directly
to
the
heirs
at
law.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
then
there
would
be
no
recovery.
it--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--i
was
going
to
explain
even
further
what
problem
we
have
in
trying
to
implement
a
1983
remedy
here.
because
the
wrongful
death
statute
is
purely
punitive,
it
doesn't
take
anything
in
nature
from
compensatory
damages.
one
example
of
two
cases
i
have
had.
one
was
a
32-year-old
georgia
tech
engineer
with
children,
making
x
dollars.
he
dies
in
an
accident
that
there
was
a
slight
negligence.
it
was
enough
for
a
cause
of
action.
that
recovery
was
very
nominal,
because
the
wrongfulness
of
the
defendant's
conduct
was
minute,
maybe
applicable.
another
case
in
which
i
represented
an
82-year-old
episcopal
priest
who
was
a
ward
of
the
church,
was
involved
in
an
accident,
but
in
that
case
the
defendant's
conduct
violated
the
law.
they
put
an
unreasonably
dangerous
load,
and
as
a
result,
that
case
had
tremendous
damages.
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
the
recovery,
as
you
have
indicated,
is
unfair
in
one
regard.
it's
also
unfair
as
to
the
compensation
aspect.
it
is
the
only
state,
and
the
reason
i
say
that,
massachusetts
used
to
have
a
similar
rule,
but
i
believe...
i'm
not
sure...
they
have
changed
the
rule.
it's
the
only
state
that
has
this
punitive
damage
statute,
and
it
totally
frustrates
a
1983
action
that
deals
with
compensation
for
the
injured,
the
person
injured,
as
the
statute
says.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
that's
correct.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
i
believe
it
does
through
robertson,
your
honor,
that
it's
the
caveat
of,
where
it
states
that
it
cannot
be
inconsistent
with
a
policy--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--well--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--it
would
be
an
establishment
of
some
sort
of
federal
common
law,
similar
to
the--
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
--well,
where
they
are
absent
of
those
statutes,
that's
what
88
i
think
envisions.
that's
what
robertson,
and
i
think
this
court
has
done
so
in
carlson
earlier.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
well,
you
need
the
1988
provision
for
the
test.
the
1988
provision
gives
you
the
test.
you
go...
it
says
you
consider
first
the
state
law
and
the
state
statutes,
but
where
they're
inconsistent,
and
in
this
particular
case
not
only
inconsistent
but
totally
devoid
of
the
underlying
purposes
because
of
the
two
alabama
statutes
that
defeat
them,
you
must
supplement
that
with
a
federal
remedy,
and
that
is
what
weeks
did,
and
that
is
what
we're
asking
this
court
to
instruct
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
to
do.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
i
do.
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
dennis
g.
pantazis
thank
you.
your
honor,
you
had
indicated
that
robertson
had
an
exception.
robertson
does
have
an
exception.
on
page
1997
it
says,
we
intimate
no
view,
moreover,
about
whether
abatement
based
on
state
law
could
be
allowed
in
a
situation
in
which
the
deprivation
of
the
federal
right
causes
a
death,
which
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
one
final
statement.
if
1988
did
not
intend
for
this
court
to
review
the
state
court's
common
law
and
statutes
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
were
inconsistent,
they
would
have
left
that
sentence
out,
but
they
didn't.
the
sentence,
a
statement
that
this
court
and
all
federal
courts
are
to
view
the
state
common
law
and
the
state
statutory
laws
for
their
inconsistency
to
the
policy
of
the
federal
1983,
and
that
i
think
answers
your
honor's
question
of
why
and
how
this
court
has
to
review
the
state
laws.
thank
you,
your
honor.
