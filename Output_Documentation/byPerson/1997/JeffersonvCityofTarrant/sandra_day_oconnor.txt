justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
i
ask
what
you're
seeking
under
the
1983
claim?
is
it
damages
for
mrs.
jefferson's
death
and
pain
and
suffering,
not
the
loss
of
association
or
consortium
by
the
remaining
family
members?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
the
1983
action,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
it
seemed
to
be
asking
for
damages
for
mrs.
jefferson's
death
and
pain
and
suffering,
as
opposed
to
anything
suffered
by
the
children
or
the
spouse.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
sorry,
you
say
you
are
not
asking,
then,
for
her
pain
and
suffering.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
that's
what...
how
the
complaint
reads.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
understand
the
complaint
with
regard
to
the
1983
claim?
is
it
a
survival
cause
of
action--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
deceased.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
do
you
understand
alabama
law
with
regard
to
a
survival
action
here
under
1983?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
federal
law
says
you
can't
recover
that
against
a
municipality.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
real
dilemma.
