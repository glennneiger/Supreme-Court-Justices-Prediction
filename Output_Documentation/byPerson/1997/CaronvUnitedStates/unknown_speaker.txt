unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
we
accept
your
interpretation
of
the
law
it
wouldn't
matter
that
the
firearms
he
had
were
the
kind
that
massachusetts
allows
him
to
have.
even
if
he
had
the
kind
that
massachusetts
didn't
allow
him
to
have
he
would
not
be
subject
to
this
provision
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
literal
reading?
would
you
go
through
that
again?
unknown
speaker
he
wasn't
pardoned,
was
he?
unknown
speaker
was
he
pardoned?
unknown
speaker
that's
where
i'm
having
trouble,
because
i
read
this
statute...
i'd
always
thought
that
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
gun
was
committing
a
federal
crime.
then
when
i
read
this
statute,
the
words
civil
rights
restored,
i
discovered
that
24
states
restore
civil
rights
virtually
automatically,
so
in
half
the
country
it
isn't
a
crime,
unless,
of
course,
in
those
states,
and
they
are
a
random
set
thereof,
that
have
some
other
gun
law
of
their
own
for
their
own
felons.
and
so
we
have
about...
i
found
about,
like
11
or
12
of
them
anyway
that
seem
to
say,
your
rights
are
restored
automatically,
they're
never
taken
away,
as
soon
as
you
get
out
of
prison,
and
by
the
way,
you
can
have
guns,
so
there,
i
guess,
there
is
no
such
law.
and
then
another
set,
about
11
say
you
can
have
some
guns
and
not
other
guns,
and
i
guess
that's
what
we
have
here,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
how
do
we
deal
with
this?
i
honestly
do
not
know.
i'm
very
interested
in
your--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
think
it
has
to
be
read
that
way.
i
mean,
you're
taking
the
literal
meaning.
suppose
it
just
prohibits
his
not
possessing
handguns.
aren't
handguns
firearms?
unknown
speaker
so
in
prohibiting
handguns
it's
prohibiting
his
possession
of
firearms.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
say
that.
i...
unless
i
have
the
wrong
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
does
not
say
no
firearms.
that's
the
whole
point.
it
says,
shall
not
be
considered
a
conviction
for
purposes
of
this
chapter
unless
such
pardon
or
restoration
expressly
provides
that
the
person
may
not
ship,
possess,
or
receive
firearms,
and
it
doesn't
say
any
firearms,
it
says
firearms.
unknown
speaker
so
you
have
to
be
very,
very
careful.
so
you
misstated
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
let
me
take
your
lawyers
example.
it
isn't
perfectly
clear.
it
could
mean
all
or
it
could
mean
some,
in
all
of
these
examples.
suppose,
with
lawyers,
someone
says,
i
have
been
cheated
by
lawyers.
does
that
mean
i
have
been
cheated
by
all
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
i
have
been
cheated
by
a,
b,
and
c,
and
wouldn't
i
make
the
statement,
i've
been
cheated
by
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
work.
it
doesn't
work
even
for
a
prohibition.
suppose
you
prohibited
your
child
from
eating
gumdrops,
and
someone
asks
you,
have
you
ever
prohibited
your
children
from
eating
candy?
wouldn't
you
reply,
yeah,
on
one
occasion
i
prohibited
them
from
eating
gumdrops.
gumdrops
are
candy.
i
have
prohibited
them
from
eating
candy.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
say
no.
i'd
say,
on
one
occasion
i
told
them
they
couldn't
eat
gumdrops.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walker,
can
we
get
away
from
grammar
for
a
moment
and
say,
why
isn't...
since
you
can
read
this
at
least
three
ways,
say
why
isn't
the
question,
is
this
person,
this
ex-felon,
now
like
everybody
else
with
respect
to
guns,
so
if
he
can
have
guns
like
someone
who
never
committed
a
crime,
fine.
then
we
know
that
he
doesn't
fit
in
this
category,
but
if
he's
not
like
everyone
else,
then
he
does.
why
isn't
that
the
most
sensible
reading
of
it?
unknown
speaker
but
your
client
is
not
like
everyone
else
because
he
can't
have
handguns
on
the
street.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
as
i
understand
it,
under
massachusetts
law
ex-felons
can
never
be
equated
to
people
who
never
committed
a
crime
because
there's
always
a
prohibition.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
deference
i
don't
think
really...
assuming
that
was
the
intent,
i
don't
think
that
gets
you
where
you
want
to
go,
because
they
could
defer
in
either
of
two
ways.
they
could
say,
if
the
state
legalizes
it,
it's
okay
with
us,
or
they
could
say,
this
is
a
very
dangerous
situation,
and
unless
the
state
wants
to
legalize
it
across
the
board
and
equate
the
convicted
felon
with
the
person
who
has
never
been
convicted,
we're
not
taking
any
chances
and
we're
going
to
treat
the
felon
as
a
felon.
in
either
case,
the
congress
would
be
deferring
ultimately
to
a
state
determination,
but
in
one
case
you
win,
in
one
case
you
lose,
so
deference
isn't
going
to
win
the
case
for
you.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
room
for
the
rule
of
lenity
here,
then.
unknown
speaker
rule
of
lenity,
i
assume,
is
a
compromise
rule.
it
says,
if
there
is
ambiguity,
then,
in
fact,
we
will
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
you're
saying
you
shouldn't
read
this
as...
i
think
you're
saying
that
you
shouldn't
read
this
as
raising
the
possibility
of
ambiguity.
it's
got
to
be
read
100
percent
in
my
favor.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
we're
not
talking
about
a
pardon.
we're
talking
about
a
statutory--
unknown
speaker
--that's
why
i
couldn't
understand
why
you
were
running
away
from
the
rule
of
lenity
that
justice
souter
brought
up.
the
rule
of
lenity
cuts
in
your
favor,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it
says
only
if
you're
totally
prohibited
will
this
criminal
law
apply
to
you.
if
you're
only
partially
prohibited
it
won't.
that's
the
more
lenient
interpretation.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
just
a
minute,
because
the
question
is,
is
it
not...
the
question
is
whether
massachusetts
law,
which
has
restored
the
civil
rights,
expressly
provides
that
a
felon
may
not
ship,
transport,
possess,
or
receive
firearms,
and
does...
is
it
not
clear
the
massachusetts
law
does
provide
that
a
felon
may
not
possess,
transport
or
ship
certain
firearms
that
other
people
can--
unknown
speaker
--well
then,
why
isn't
the
plain
language
against
you?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
understand.
unknown
speaker
the
question
is
whether
what
he
cannot
ship,
transport,
or
possess
is
a
firearm,
and
there
are
certain
firearms
that
he
may
not
ship,
transport,
possess
or
receive.
unknown
speaker
and
other
citizens
may.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
what
it
did
say.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
says,
unless
such
pardon,
restoration...
expressly
provides
that
the
person
may
not
ship,
transport,
possess
or
receive
firearms.
unknown
speaker
and
it
does.
unknown
speaker
his
restoration
of
civil
rights
is
not
total.
it
is
limited
by
the
fact
that
he
may
not
possess,
transport
or
receive
certain
firearms.
unknown
speaker
well,
he
may
not
have
those
firearms,
the
ones
that
he's
prohibited
from
having.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walker,
i
think
i
agree
with
your
analysis
generally
that
when
a
prohibition
is
expressed
without
qualification...
no
candy,
no
firearms...
that
means
absolutely
none,
and
that's
not
what
we
have
here
in
massachusetts.
i'll
grant
you
that.
the
trouble
with
that
analysis,
and
the
trouble
with
saying
therefore
plain
meaning
governs
in
your
favor,
is
that
it
leads
to
a
crazy
result
which
i
find
it
very
difficult
to
believe
congress
could
have
intended,
because
it...
i
mean,
it
leads
to
the
result
of
saying
that
the
fact
that
massachusetts
draws
a
line,
and
we
are
referring
to
massachusetts
law
at
least
for
some
purpose
here,
the
line
is
nonetheless
irrelevant.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
the
strangeness
of
that
result
which
it
is
very
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
congress
could
possibly
have
intended.
e.g.,
massachusetts
says,
rifles
are
okay
but
no
machine
guns,
the
fellow
possesses
a
machine
gun
and
congress
would
have
meant
to
say,
machine
guns
are
therefore
fine.
that's
hard
to
accept.
isn't
that
the
problem
with
your
case,
and
isn't
that
why
we
should
not
look
at
this
as
a
plain
meaning
case?
unknown
speaker
take
the...
take
that
case,
because
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
which
i'm
not
certain
i
see
the
answer
to.
say,
does
virginia's
law
prohibit
felons
from
having
firearms?
i
don't
know.
and
if
it
has
some
firearms
and
not
others,
i'm
not
sure
how
to
answer
the
question,
so
i
think
it's
ambiguous.
but
if
it
is
ambiguous,
then
what
she
said
applied
to
pardons
or
to
expungements
or
to
restoration
of
civil
rights,
that
the
basic
objective
of
the
statute
is
to
ask
whether
or
not
the
state
is
treating
this
felon
as
if
he's
now
like
everybody
else
or
whether
he
isn't,
so
if
you
pardon
him,
you
assume
he's
back
in
the
group
of
people
that
are
like
everybody
else.
we
wiped
it
out,
and
the
same,
en
masse,
with
the
civil
rights
restoration.
but
it
isn't
wiped
out...
it
isn't
wiped
out,
and
he's
not
like
everybody
else,
if
that
wiping
out
had
a
condition
attached,
which
condition
was,
we're
not
treating
you
like
everybody
else
in
respect
to
firearms.
and
now,
if
that's
the
purpose,
what's
the
point,
either
in
the
pardon
case,
the
expungement
case
or
the
civil
rights
case,
of
insisting
that
the
states
say,
oh,
we're
really
not
treating
you
like
everybody
else
in
that
you
can't
even
have
cannons,
atomic
bombs,
all
this
stuff.
we
have
to
put
it
all
in
there,
and
why
isn't
it
enough
to
say
that,
well,
most
of
the
firearms
are
in
there
so
they're
not
like
somebody
else,
or
even
a
significant
amount?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
policy
question.
unknown
speaker
the
federal
statute
is
saying
when
these
three
happen
in
respect
to
firearms,
any
of
these
three
things,
the
felon
is,
in
effect,
put
back
in
the
big
pool
of
everybody,
but
he's
not
put
back
in
the
big
pool
of
everybody
if
that
event,
which
to
a
degree
at
least
made
him
like
everybody,
is
conditioned
in
a
firearmsrelated
way.
now,
if
that's
what
we're
doing,
why
wouldn't
the
common
sense
of
it
be,
is
there
a
significant
firearms
condition,
not
is
there
a
perfect
complete
firearms
condition,
but
just
is
there
a
significant
firearms
condition?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
can
make
sense
out
of
the
policy
that
this
statute
has
to
be
enforced
nationwide.
i
mean,
this
man
might
well
have
been
arrested
in
california,
and
we
would
have
had
to
look
back
at
the
massachusetts
law,
and
the
federal
government
might
say
if
there
are
any...
they
didn't
put
it
in
precisely
these
terms,
but
their
policy
might
be,
if
your
civil
rights
have
been
restored
but
there
is
a
condition,
and
you
do
not
have
full
restoration
as
to
any
firearms
at
all,
that's
enough
for
us.
you
cannot
carry...
you
will
be
deemed
a
felon
in
possession
for
the
federal
statute.
that's
a
perfectly
sensible
policy
so
far
as
i'm
concerned.
unknown
speaker
it
didn't
overrule
us.
it
just
changed
one
of
its
statutes,
which
was
broken.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
walker.
mr.
nuechterlein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact
that
there
are
these
differences
of
opinion
may
point
in
the
direction
of
suggesting
that
the
language
is
ambiguous,
and
therefore
we
have
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenity.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
a
certain
incongruity
in
saying
that
you're
following
state
law
and
yet...
this
person
was
apparently
allowed
to
possess
long
guns
under
state
law,
and
yet
he's
being
prosecuted
as
a
felon
in
possession.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say
it's
not
deference
across
the
board.
it's
just
deference
in
one
particular.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
for
sentencing
under
the
three-strikes-you're-out
proposal,
because
if
the
massachusetts
convictions
don't
qualify
then
he'd
be
sentenced
differently.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
reading
you
espoused
may
be
the
one
that
most
closely
tracks
what
congress
must
have
intended,
but
i'm
not
certain
that
the
language
requires
it,
and
in
that
posture
i
ask
you
again
whether
we
don't
have
to
be
concerned
about
the
rule
of
lenity.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
nuechterlein--
--your
example
assumes
not
just
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity,
but
also
rewriting
of
the
statute
pursuant
to
the
rule
of
lenity,
because
even
if
you
applied
the
rule
of
lenity,
that
doesn't...
that
gets
you
to
the
point
where
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
he
brought
a
shotgun
or
a
short
gun,
it
would...
he
would
simply
be
able
to
have
all
firearms
or
be
able
to
have
no
firearms.
that
is
to
say,
even
if
he
had
a
firearm
that
was
forbidden
by
the
state,
if
you
take
the
reading
given
by
petitioner,
even
if
he
brought
a
handgun,
which
the
state
prohibits,
he
wouldn't
be
sentenced
as
a
recidivist
under
this
provision.
unknown
speaker
but
i
think
the--
--that's
what
the--
--i
was
going
to
yield
to
justice
souter
the
remainder
of
my
time.
[laughter]
there
are
three
possible
readings,
and
i
think
that
the
petitioner
will
take
two
out
of
those
three,
so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
all
or
nothing,
or--
--only
if
you
don't
want
to
make
up
language
that
the
statute
doesn't
contain.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
question
the
plaus...
here's
the
problem
that
i
have
with
the
plausibility.
the
plausibility
problem
on
the
other
side
i
think
is
clear.
you
know,
you
allow
the
person
under
state
law
to
buy
a
single-shot.22
and
he
says,
that
means
i
can
buy
a
machine
gun.
congress
couldn't
have
meant
that.
the
implausibility
on
your
side,
though,
it
seems
to
me,
is
this,
that
on
your
reading
state
law
becomes
a
trap.
i
find
it
implausible
to
believe
that
congress
wrote
that
statute
having
state
law
in
mind
as
relevant
for
some
purpose,
nonetheless
assuming
that
even
though
state
law
says
you
can
have
the
single-shot.22,
you
follow
state
law,
you
do
what
is
lawful
under
state
law,
and
you
still
get
caught
under
the
federal
statute.
that
turns
state
law
into
a
trap,
and
that
seems
to
me
the
source
of
the
implausibility
for
your
all-or-nothing
reading.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
he
would
not
be
barred,
in
effect,
through
the
use
of
the
massachusetts
scheme
as
a
pitfall,
or
as
a
trap
for
him.
federal
law
would
straightforwardly
say,
no.
but
this
is
not
a
case
where
state...
i
mean,
the
argument
here
is
not
a
case
where
federal
law
is
straightforwardly
saying
no.
federal
law
is
making
a
reference
to
state
law.
state
law
says
it's
okay,
and
then
federal
law
in
effect
says,
well,
on
one
all-or-nothing
grammatical
reading,
that
isn't
good
enough.
that's
a
strange
scheme
when
you're
dealing
with
convicted
felons.
unknown
speaker
in
any
way.
unknown
speaker
but
he
has
to
commit
a
felony,
and
he
would
say,
well,
you
know...
and
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
i
don't
feel
too
sorry
for
him,
because
it's
just
a
question
of
how
much
of
a
penalty
he
gets
for
a
later
felony
that
he
committed,
but
the
statute
also
covers
a
case
where
he
hasn't
committed
any
later
felony,
and
he's
just
following
the
state
law
which
says,
you
may
now
possess
long
guns,
and
suddenly
he's
guilty,
nonetheless,
of
a
federal
firearms
offense.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't...
i
mean,
i
don't
understand
what
congress
was
driving
at.
that's
what
i...
and
the
reason
is,
as
justice
souter
was
saying,
is
it's
plausible
congress
could
have
meant,
once
the
state
decides
to
let
these
previously
convicted
felons
carry
some
guns,
federal
law
jumps
out
of
the
business
and
we
leave
it
up
to
state
law,
and
he'll
be
punished
if
he's
carrying
the
kinds
of
guns
he
shouldn't
and
he
won't
be
punished
if
he's
carrying
the
kinds
of
guns
he
should.
i
mean,
that's
a
possible
reading
of
the
statute,
in
which
case
the
anomaly
of
him
being
able
to
carry
anything,
even
if
the
state
lets
him
carry
some
things,
is
no
longer
anomalous.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
a
possible
reading.
what
i
can't
get
at
is,
what
was
congress
up
to?
i
mean,
as
i
said
before,
it
seems
to
me
that
with
this
word
civil
rights
they've
sort
of
taken
this
statute
away
from
half
the
country,
and
then
when
you
start
looking
to
how
these
24
states
get
back
into
it
there's
a
whole
nightmare
of
different
rules
and
regulations
as
to
when
some
guns
can
be
carried
and
you
can't
carry
others,
et
cetera.
so
what
was
congress
doing,
in
other
words,
if
it
didn't
mean
to
take
the
federal
government
out
of
the
business
entirely
in
respect
to
prior
felons
if
the
state
was
willing
to
let
those
prior
felons
carry
some
guns?
what
other
purpose
could
congress
have
had?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right
in
understanding
that
there
was
a
lot
of
labor
lost,
if
your
interpretation
is
correct,
with
all
the
time
that
the
first
circuit
spent
figuring
out
if
civil
rights
had
been
restored?
that
was
academic.
they
should
have
gone
right
to
the
gun
prohibition.
they
should
have
seen
that
x
felon
for
life
is
barred
from
carrying
at
least
some
guns,
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
unknown
speaker
but
shouldn't
the
district
court
have
gone
right
to
that
question?
unknown
speaker
why
get
into
this
whole
hassle
about
whether
civil
rights
had
been
restored
if
the
federal
legislation
means
so
long
as
the
state
bars
you
from
carrying
any
gun
you
don't
come
out
from
this
category?
unknown
speaker
what
do...
if
my...
the
question
i
just
asked
you...
you
remember
that
one?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
that
wasn't
necessarily
my
view,
but
suppose
the
view
that
underlay
that
question
was
right,
then
i
guess
when
you
went
back
to
the
history
of
this
statute,
they
would
have
not
just...
they
would
have
been
gutting
the
prior
law,
so
you
would
have
thought
that
there
would
have
been
huge
arguments
about
it,
whether
this
basic
statute,
you
know,
that
forbids
felons
to
possess
guns
was
really
going
to
be...
half
of
it
chopped
away.
there
would
have
been
an
enormous
argument.
on
the
other
hand,
on
your
reading
of
it,
it
makes
a
kind
of
odd,
bizarre,
but
narrow
exception
that
has
weird,
jagged
edges.
very
well,
maybe
there
wasn't
a
lot
of
debate
about
that.
maybe
it
went
unnoticed.
well,
when
you
look
into
this,
what
was
it?
what
was
the
debate
like?
i
mean,
what
was
the
discussion
like
when
they
passed
this
statute?
unknown
speaker
was
this
meant
to
be
a
major
change
in
the
statute
that
really
would
have
eradicated
half
the
statute,
or
was
it
meant
to
be
some
minor
thing?
unknown
speaker
how
many
states
are
there
that
allow
ex-felons
free
access
to
guns
just
like
everyone
else?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
even
for
embezzlers
and
bigamists?
unknown
speaker
no
matter
what
felony,
whether
it's
a
violent
crime
or
not.
unknown
speaker
maybe
embezzlers
have
their
check-writing
privileges
restored
gradually.
[laughter]
i'm
trying
to
find
out
whether
this
statute...
whether
there's
any
ex-felon
that
benefits
from
this
provision.
i've
had
all
my
civil
rights
restored,
but...
so
if
there
are
states
that
say,
ex-felon,
after
a
certain
amount
of
time
you
can
buy
guns,
and
you're
subject
to
the
prohibitions
that
everyone
else
is,
but
no
more.
if
there
aren't
states
that
do
that,
then
i
would
resist
interpreting
a
statute
to
do
nothing.
unknown
speaker
and
in
massachusetts
your
view
is
that
no
ex-felon...
the
massachusetts
conviction
will
always
stick
because
there's
always
a
bar
on
at
least
some
gun
possession.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
nuechterlein.
mr.
walker,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
just
the
difference...
the
difference...
the
consequence
of
this,
am
i
right
that
it
was
120
months
versus
262
months?
is
that
what
we're--
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
