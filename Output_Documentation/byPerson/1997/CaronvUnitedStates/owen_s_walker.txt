mr.
owen
s.
walker
thank
you.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
a
person
is
pardoned
or
has
civil
rights
restored,
the
statute
at
issue
says
his
conviction
is
considered
a
predicate
conviction
under
federal
firearms
law
only
if
the
pardon
or
restoration
of
rights
expressly
provides
that
he
may
not
ship,
transport,
possess,
or
receive
firearms.
my
client's...
when
my
client's
rights
were
restored,
massachusetts
law
told
him
that
he
could
possess
rifles
and
shotguns
and,
indeed,
possess
a
handgun
in
his
home.
he's
now
serving
an
additional
12
years
on
his
sentence
for
possessing
the
very
firearms
that
massachusetts
law
told
him
that
he
could
possess.
we
say
it's
self-evident
that
the
statute...
that
it
cannot
be
said
that
massachusetts
expressly
provides
that
he
could
not
ship,
transport,
possess,
or
receive
firearms.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
that
is
the...
what
the
statute
literally
says,
and
it
is
the...
we
contend
the
only
literal
reading
of
the
statute.
if
the
court
chooses
to
follow
that
literal
reading,
that
is
fine
as
far
as
my
client
is
concerned.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
the
literal
reading
is
that
if
the...
a
conviction...
if
a
pardon
says...
only
if
a
pardon
says
you
can
have
no
firearms,
only
if
a
pardon
says
no
firearms
can
the
conviction
be
considered
a
conviction.
this
is...
he
was
not
told
no
firearms.
he
was
told
a
lot
of
firearms,
indeed,
most
firearms,
and--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
owen
s.
walker
no.
his
situation
is
a
restoration
of
civil
rights,
your
honor,
but
the
analysis
is
the
same.
the
so-called--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--that's
correct.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
well,
i
would
suggest
that
the
court
should
follow
the
words
of
the
statute.
the
statute
does
not
say
that
a
conviction
remains
a
federal
predicate
if
there
are
firearms
that
the
pardon,
or
restoration
of
civil
rights,
expressly
provides
the
person
can't
have.
it
doesn't
say
that
the
conviction
remains
a
predicate
if
the
pardon
or
restoration
of
rights
restricts
firearms
privileges,
and
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
congress
to
say
those
things.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
well,
that's--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--there
is
a
false
syllogism
in
the
circuit
court's
reading
of
the
statute,
and
it
goes
like
this.
let's
say
you
like
lawyers.
you
like
almost
all
lawyers,
but
a,
b,
and
c
are
particular
lawyers
that
you
don't
like,
so
the
syllogism
that
is
false
goes
like
this.
i
do
not
like
a,
b,
and
c.
a,
b,
and
c
are
lawyers.
therefore,
i
do
not
like
lawyers.
it
comes
out
completely
the
opposite
of
the
truth,
almost
completely
the
opposite.
the
fact
is,
you
like
lawyers,
but
if
you
follow
that
logic,
you
end
up
with
almost
a
contrary
meaning.
the
statute
says
no
firearms.
it
says
the
state
law--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--well...
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
that's
correct,
your
honor.
for
example--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--well,
i
beg
to
differ,
your
honor.
if
the
governor
told
her
staffer,
draw
up
the
pardon
for
smith,
and
i
want
it
to
expressly
provide
that
smith
cannot
ship,
transport,
possess
or
receive
firearms.
the
staffer
goes
and
writes
those
words
and
also
adds...
staffer,
let's
say,
likes
hunting
and
says,
but
the
person
can
have
rifles
and
shotguns
to
go
hunting.
so
the
governor
is
looking
the
next
day
through
her
papers,
is
about
to
sign
the
pardon,
and
she
looks
down
and
says,
what's
this
about
rifles
and
shotguns.
i
told
you
to
draw
up
a
pardon
that
expressly
provided
that
smith
couldn't
ship,
transport,
possess
or
receive
firearms.
it's
perfectly
clear
what
that
means.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
that...
that--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--well,
that
is
a
different...
there's
no
prohibition
in
that.
there
are
no
words
of
prohibition.
for
example,
if
you
tell
your
children,
you
can't
have
candy,
and
later
in
the
day
you
find
out
that
they
have
had
some
candy,
and
they
said,
their
answer
is,
well,
you
didn't
say
that
we
couldn't
have
some
candy.
you
just
said
we
can't
have
candy,
and
that's
true.
m&m's,
we
didn't
eat
them,
but
they
are
candy,
and
the
parent
says,
i
said
you
can't
have
candy,
and
the
statute
says--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--you
would
say
there's
certain
candy
that
i
prohibited
my
child
from
eating,
but
if
the
question
is,
have
you
ever
expressly
told
your
children
not
to
eat
candy,
the
answer
would
be
no,
if
you've
only
limited
it
to
m&m's.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
right,
i
couldn't
eat...
but
you
wouldn't
say,
on
one
occasion
i
told
them
they
couldn't
eat
candy.
the
other
person
may
be
asking
about
their
teeth,
for
example.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
i
think
that
is
the
most
sensible
reading.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
other
people
can't
have
handguns
on
the
street
unless
they
get
a
special
license.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that's
correct.
but
the...
well,
there's
certainly...
i
have
to
address
the
question
of
congressional
intent,
which
clearly
weighs
heavily
on
our
side,
deference
to
state
lawmakers,
and
justice
breyer
has
pointed
out
that
12
or
so
states
make
this
distinction,
the
some
but
not
all
guns
distinction.
the
statute
is
this...
the
changes
were
based...
in
the
statute
were
based
on
deference
to
the
states.
the
name
of
the
statute,
firearms
owners
protection
act,
and
there's
all
kinds
of
history
about
how
the
atf
was
bothering
innocent-minded
people--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
think
first
of
all
they
aren't...
certainly
aren't
deferring
to
the
12
or...
11
or
12
states
that
make
the
distinction.
what
they're
saying
is,
we'll
defer
to
you...
if
you
want
to
ban
all
guns,
federal
law...
for
ex-felons,
federal
law
will
coincide.
if
you
want
them
to
have
all
firearms,
federal
law
will
coincide.
but
if
you
try
to
split
the
difference,
if
you
try
to
make
reasonable
compromises
about
what
kinds
of
guns
ex-felons
can
have,
that's
out.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
well,
there's...
i
do
not
think--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--i
am
just
saying...
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
there
was
only
one
reading
that
is
grammatically
correct
that
the
ordinary
person
who
had
a
pardon
that
says
on
it,
pardon,
you
can
have
all
the
hunting
guns
you--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--well,
there...
if
your
honor
please,
the
issue
of
some
but
not
all
is
exactly
the
same
for
the
pardon
as
it
is
for
restoration
of
civil
rights.
indeed,
i
suggest
that
the
reason
the
lower
courts,
or
some
lower
courts
read
this
wrong
is,
they
got
into
this
whole
question
of
restoration
of
civil
rights,
which
has
confounded
all
kinds
of
courts
on
all
kinds
of
issues.
the
simplest
example
is
the
some
but
not
all
pardon,
the
person
that
holds
the
pardon
that
says
that
he
can
have
rifles
and
shotguns
but
not
handguns.
he
looks
at
it,
says
i
can
have
rifles
and
shotguns,
he
looks
at
the
statute
and
he
says,
does
this
statute
expressly
provide
that
i
can't
have
firearms?
no.
it
says
i
can
have
most
firearms.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
well,
i
think
it
does
ultimately.
it's
certainly
in
my
brief,
and
i--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--i
agree,
your
honor,
completely,
but
i
do
think
the
government's
attempt
to
come
up
with
a
different
interpretation
of
the
literal
interpretation
is
very
strange,
this
question
about
there's
four
verbs
in
the
statute
rather
than
only
one;
that
suddenly
changes
the
whole
meaning
of
the
statute;
that's
why
the
first
circuit
was
right;
they
didn't
realize
it,
but
it
was
because
there
were
four
verbs
there.
i
don't
think
that
cuts
the
mustard,
and
therefore
i
don't
think
the
rule
of
lenity
is
necessary,
but
reasonable
people
may
disagree.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
there
are
firearms
which
massachusetts
law--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--there
is
a
difference
between,
there
are
certain
items
that
are--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--exactly,
your
honor,
and
if
congress
had--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--if
congress
had
said
that--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--no,
it
said...
it
doesn't
say,
if
there
are
firearms--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--right.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
no.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
i
dis...
i
completely
agree
that
there
are
firearms
that
massachusetts
prohibits
the
ex-felon
from
having,
but
i
disagree
that
massachusetts
expressly
provides
that
a
felon
may
not
have
firearms.
an
express
provision--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--that's
correct,
but
when
you
say
candy
is
prohibited
to
a
child...
i
expressly
provide
you
can't
have
candy,
you're
saying
to
the
child,
no
candy,
no
m&m's
or
whatever.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
if
your
honor
please,
the
only
literal...
my
position
is,
the
only
literal
reading
produces
that
result,
but
as
the
court
recently
said,
a
literal
reading
that
dramatically
separates
a
statute
from
its
purpose
should
not
be
followed
that
far,
and
that's
in
the
lewis
case
on
any
enactment
in
the
assimilated
crimes
act.
and
i
would
suggest
the
ordinary
person
that
is
holding
the
pardon
that
says,
you
can
have
rifles,
if
somebody
says,
the
statute
doesn't
expressly
provide
i
can't
have
firearms,
some
clever
person
comes
along
and
says,
this
is
great,
you
don't
have
a
conviction
now,
therefore
you
can
go
out
and
get
concealed
weapons
and
you
can
go
up
to
the
atf
and
thumb
your
nose
at
them,
that's
really
great,
and
the
ordinary
person
isn't
going
to
say,
oh,
great.
the
ordinary
person
is
going
to
say,
that's
not
what
my
pardon...
my
pardon
doesn't
extend
that
far.
that's
a
nice
technical
reading.
that's
a
nice
sort
of
philosophical
cuteness,
but
it
obviously
isn't
what
congress
probably
meant
to
say.
it's
what
congress
said,
but
it
does
go
beyond
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
because
in
fact--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--because
in
fact,
your
honor,
restoration
of
civil
rights
does
not
treat...
result
in
treating
somebody
as
if
they'd
basically
never
been
convicted.
it's
very
narrow.
it's
right
to
jury,
hold
public
office,
et
cetera...
serve
on
a
jury,
hold
public
office.
and
the...
in
fact,
you
can
be
on
parole
in
several
states...
and
massachusetts
is
one.
you
can
be
on
parole
for
a
long,
long
time,
20
years.
after
7
years
your
civil
rights
are
restored,
you're
allowed
to
have
some
firearms
and
not
other
firearms,
but
the
state
hasn't
declared
you
like
all
other
citizens.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
well,
if
your
honor
please,
i'm
not
making
myself
clear.
a
person
can
have
his
rights,
civil
rights
restored
and
every
week
have
to
report
to
a
parole
officer,
every
week,
or
he
has
to
register
as
a
sex
offender,
let's
say.
he
can't
testify
in
a
trial
without
being
impeached.
he's
not
trust...
he's
considered
rather
untrustworthy
by
the
state,
yet
his
civil
rights
have
been
restored
and
he's
like
everybody
else
with
respect
to
firearms.
this
trustworthiness
rationale
that
the
sixth
circuit
came
up
with
and
the
first
circuit
followed
does
not
work.
the
person
is
not
treated
as
being
free
of
stigma,
having
a
clean
record.
that
is
not
necessary
to
be
reinstated
to
one's
firearms
rights
under
massachusetts
law
and
several
other
states,
so
there's
no
policy
here
that...
the
reason
that
you...
that
you
can't
have
rifles
if
you
can't
have
handguns
is
that
basically
that
means
that
we
don't
really
trust
you.
in
fact,
you
can
have
rifles
even
though
we
think
you
should
report
to
a
parole
officer,
should
register,
or
whatever,
so
there
is
no
policy
rationale
that
supports
the
government's
position.
but
the
question
of
deference
and
the
federal
deference
to
state
authorities
is
a
very
significant
one,
and
it's...
the
words
of
the
congressional
history
about
honoring
the
intent
of
the
states,
giving
the
states
flexibility,
all
cut
our
way,
and
it
is
very
odd...
it
would
be,
i
would
say,
very
odd
for
congress
to
say
look,
if
you
want
to
be
able
to
let
your
civil-rights-restored
felon
go
hunting,
then
you've
got
to
give
him
saturday
night
specials,
concealed
weapons,
and
everything
else.
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
suggest--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--well,
there...
if
congress
had
said
that,
if
the
congress
had
said,
if
there
are
firearms
you
can't
possess,
and
we're
just
not
going
to
make
these
interstate
distinctions
in
that
kind
of
thing,
that
would
be
a
sensible
policy.
but
i
would...
i
have
to
say
to
the
court
that
congress
rejected
this
simplicity
rationale
in
the
previous
sentence
on
what
defines
a
conviction,
and
basically...
i
don't
know
how
to
say
this
tactfully,
but
it
basically
said
that
this
court
in
the
dickerson
case,
that
said
you
have
to
interpret
the
word
conviction
federally
one
way,
it
said...
it
overruled
this
court.
it
says,
you've
got
to
look
each
time
a
felon
possession
case
comes
up
to
determine
whether
the
person--
mr.
owen
s.
walker
--well,
thank
you,
your
honor.
[laughter]
but
at
any
rate,
it
paid...
the
parade
of...
or
the
problems
that
this
court
pointed
out
with
the
other
interpretation
congress
ignored.
it
said,
you've
got
to
do
a
lot
of
work,
judges,
here,
to
figure
out
what
the
law
is,
even
though
you're
an
idaho
case
with
a
massachusetts
prior
conviction.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions
i
would
ask
to
reserve.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
may
it
please
the
court,
unless
the
court
has
further
questions,
i
have
no
further
argument.
mr.
owen
s.
walker
the
maximum
would
have
been
10
years,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
so
the
add-on
because
of
the
fact
that
he
did
what...
well,
because
of
the
court's...
circuit's
interpretation
of
this
statute
was
12
additional
years.
well,
11
years
and
10
months
additionally.
