mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
our
view
the
unless
clause
of
section
921(a)(20)
means
that
a
past
felony
conviction
counts
for
purposes
of
federal
firearms
law
if
the
convicting
jurisdiction
gives
continuing
effect
to
the
conviction
in
a
manner
that
relates
to
firearms.
that
is
the
majority
view
among
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
this
issue.
under
the
minority
view,
which
is
what
the
petitioner
has
supported
here,
a
past
state
conviction
counts
for
federal
purposes
only
if
the
convicting
state
prohibits
its
felons
from
possessing
the
kind
of
gun
that
the
felon
is
caught
with
in
the
present--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
in
our
brief
we've
noted
that
there
are
two
possible
grammatical
ways
to
read
this
language,
but
one
of
them
is
not
what
petitioner
proposes
here.
a
conviction
either
counts
as
a
conviction
for
purposes
of
federal
law
or
it
doesn't.
the
inquiry
under
section
921(a)(20)
turns
on
whether
a
state
has
restored
a
felon's
civil
rights
and,
if
so,
whether
it
has
continued
to
impose
restrictions
on
his
firearms
possession.
if
that
is
the
case,
then
the
conviction
remains
a
conviction
with
respect
to
any
firearms
that
the
felon
may
possess
in
the
present.
it
triggers
the
prohibition
under
the
felon-in-possession
statute,
section
922(g),
that
a
felon
may
not
possess
any
firearms.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
federal
law
requires
a
court
to
look
to
the
law
of
the
convicting
jurisdiction
for
its
purpose,
and
everyone
acknowledges
that,
but
the
purpose
is
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
convicting
jurisdiction
has
continued
to
give
the
conviction
effect
with
respect
to
firearms,
and
that
is
the
only
respect
in
which
federal
law
defers
to
state
law
in
this
context.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
correct,
and
it's
important
to
remember
that
even
under
petitioner's
position
there
are
a
variety
of
contexts
in
which
federal
law
would
criminalize
the
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
felon
where
a
state
law
would
not.
for
example,
in
this
case
petitioner
has
prior
convictions
in
california
and
also
under
federal
law,
so
no
matter
what
massachusetts
does
to
restore
his
civil
rights
for
his
massachusetts
convictions,
and
no
matter
what
massachusetts
says
with
respect
to
his
firearms
privileges,
he
still
remains
a
felon
in
possession
for
purposes
of
federal
law.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
i
think
that
the
fact
that
this
case
arises
as
a
924(e)
case
dealing
with
the
recidivism
sentencing
provision,
merely
serves
to
emphasize
why
this
reading
has
to
be
correct.
it's
implausible
to
believe
that
congress
would
want
the
recidivism
inquiry,
which
is...
looks
to
how
dangerous
this
particular
person
is
based
on
his
past
convictions--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
i
think
again
the
rule
of
lenity
can
only
be
used
to
advocate
a
position
that
is
consistent
with
the
statutory
text,
and
this
statutory
text
cannot
be
read
to
turn
on
what
kind
of
firearm
a
felon
happens
to
possess
in
the
present.
returning
back
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
section
924(e)
proceeding,
it's
very
unlikely,
we
believe,
that
congress
would
want
the
recidivism
inquiry
to
turn
on
whether
petitioner
brought
a
rifle
or
a
handgun
to
the
scene
of
his
july
1993
assault.
what
matters
is
that
with
respect
to
none
of
these
violent
felony
convictions
had
the
state
wiped
his
slate
clean.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
correct,
and
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
the
rule
of
lenity
cannot
be
used
to
support
a
reading
of
a
statute
that
gives
rise
to
implausible
results
and
that
would
be
one
of
them.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
the
rule
of
lenity
would
not...
could
not
be
used
to
support
a
reading
of
the
statute
that
is
either
implausible
or
is
grammatically
incompatible
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
reading
that
the
first
circuit
shows
here
is
the
only
reading
that
is
both
grammatical
and
plausible.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
disagree
for
two
reasons.
one
is
that
there
are
many
circumstances
in
which
both
state
and
federal
law
address
the
same
subject
matter
under
criminal
law,
and
a
person
is
assumed
to
both
know
about
and
to
comply
with
both,
but
more
importantly,
under
any
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
that
includes
petitioner's,
there
will
be
a
broad
range
of
circumstances
in
which
federal
law
would
criminalize
what
state
law
expressly
permits,
and
this
is
an
example
of
such
a
case.
if
you
disregard
the
three
previous
massachusetts
convictions
it
would
still
remain
the
case
that
in
1970
petitioner
was
convicted
of
attempted
murder
in
california.
no
matter
what
massachusetts,
the
jurisdiction
of
his
long-time
residence,
says
to
him
about
his
right
to
possess
firearms,
he
would
still
be
barred
under
federal
law
from
possessing
them.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
federal
law
in
our
view
does,
in
fact,
expressly
prohibit
possession
of
a
firearm
by
a
felon
if
the
convicting
jurisdiction
has
not...
or
has
continued
to
give
effect
to
his
conviction
in
a
manner
that
relates
to
firearms.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
but
even
in
massachusetts,
even
if
you
look
only
at
massachusetts,
then
there
are
two
additional
circumstances
under
which
the
federal
law
prohibition
will
be
broader
than
the
state
law
prohibition
under
anybody's
construction
of
the
statute.
for
example,
he
committed
a
federal
felony
in
massachusetts.
notwithstanding
anything
that
massachusetts
tells
him
about
his
firearms
privileges,
he
is
still
a
felon
in
possession
under
the
federal
criminal
prohibition,
and
there's
also--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--justice
scalia,
if
congress
had
wanted
simply
to
track
in
every
respect
the
state
law
prohibition
it
would
have
been
very
easy
for
it
to
have
done
that,
and
it
didn't.
but
the
more
important
point
is
that
even
if
he
only
had
one
felony
conviction
and
that
felony
conviction
was
in
massachusetts,
there
is
a
2-year
window
after
which
massachusetts
restores
some
of
its
firearms
privileges
but
does
not
restore
his
civil
rights.
there
are
jurisdictions
that
restore
firearms
privileges
before
civil
rights,
and
even
with
respect
to
those
jurisdictions
the
federal
prohibition
still
obtains.
there's
still...
because
we
have
a
two-step
inquiry
it's
inconceivable
that
congress
meant
to
defer
to
state
law
in
every
respect.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
right.
it's
important,
though--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--it's
important
to
remember
the
historical
backdrop
against
which
congress
legislated.
up
till
1986
it
was
always
a
felony
for
a
felon
to
possess
firearms
if
he
had
a
state
conviction
for
a
felony,
notwithstanding
anything
the
state
had
done
to
restore
his
rights,
either
monolithically
or
partially.
congress
then
began
in
this
legislation
with
the
presumption
that
felons
are
too
dangerous
to
have
firearms,
but
it
made
an
exception
in
cases
where
a
state
has
decided
not
to
give
continuing
effect
to
the
conviction
for
purposes
of
civil
rights
for
firearms
privileges,
and
that
is
the
bright-line
rule
that
congress
imposed
here,
and
it
is
a
rule
of
national
application.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
the
district
court
had
never
reached
the
firearms
restriction
question,
because
under
binding
first
circuit
precedent--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--it
was--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--it
was
because
at
the
time
the
district
court
ruled,
the
first
circuit
law
was
crystal
clear.
if
you
hadn't
received
an
individualized
pardon
or
restoration
of
civil
rights,
then
that
was
the
end
of
the
inquiry,
so
that
was
the
simplest
basis
on
which
the
district
court
could
have
resolved
the
case,
and
it
was
on
that
basis
that
the
first
circuit
then
revisited
its
earlier
precedent.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
yes.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
there
wasn't--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--no.
in
fact,
the
statute
does
not
reflect
a
belief
by
congress
that
it
was
overhauling
the
federal
felon-in-possession
prohibition.
congress
was
responding
to
this
court's
decision
in
dickerson
that
held
that
whether
something
should
be
counted
as
a
conviction
to
begin
with
under...
for
purposes
of
the
statute,
this
court
had
held
that
that
question
should
be
held
purely
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
what
was
at
issue
there
was
a
state
procedure
of
deferred
adjudication,
and
this
court
held
that
even
though
the
state
didn't
characterize
deferred
adjudication
as
a
conviction,
that
it
would
be
deemed
a
conviction
for
purposes
of
federal
law,
so
that
was...
that,
along
with
situations
where
someone
is
given
a
blanket
pardon
and
his
conviction
is
treated
as
a
nullity,
were
the
two
situations
that
congress
was
focused
on.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
states
have
50
different
approaches
to
this
problem,
and
i've...
i
couldn't
give
you
an
exact
figure,
but
i
do
know
that
most
states
do
not
restore
firearms
privileges
immediately
upon
release
from
confinement.
that
occurs
gradually
over
time.
about
half
the
states--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
think
most
state
statutes
are
phrased
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
you've
committed
a
felony.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
some
states
i
think
also
have
fine-tuned
this
to
focus--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--justice
ginsburg,
there
are
states
that
do
that.
the
question
is
how
long
it
takes
for
firearms
privileges
to
be
restored.
about
half
of
the
states
in
the
federal
system
are
all-or-nothing
states,
such
that
they
either
prohibit
possession
of
all
firearms,
or
they
permit
possession
of
all
firearms
after
a
certain
point.
some
states,
like
vermont,
restore
firearms
privileges
immediately
upon
release
from
prison.
others
take
10
years,
15
years,
but
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
cases...
there
are
a
substantial
number
of
states
in
which
firearms
privileges
are
either
completely
withheld
or
completely
restored.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
unless
the
felon
were
to
have
that
removed
under
state
law
processes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
