chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-910,
the
city
of
chicago
v.
the
international
college
of
surgeons.
ms.
solomon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
isn't
the
term
civil
action
kind
of
a
word
of
art?
you
find
it
in
a
particular
section
of
the
federal
jurisdiction
statute,
and
it
may
not
have
counterparts
in
state
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you're
not
saying
that
someone
seeking
review
of
the
landmarks
commission
could
file
directly
in
federal
court
before
it
had
gone
to
the
state
court,
have
you...
are
you?
because
that's
contrary
to
our
stude
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
how...
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that's
how
it's
distinguished
from
stude,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
solomon,
in
the
stude
opinion
at
page
581
the
court
says,
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa
does
not
sit
to
review
on
appeal
action
taken
administratively
or
judicially
in
a
state
proceeding.
now,
do
you
agree
with
that,
or
do
you
want
us
to
repudiate
that?
we
certainly
agree
with
it
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
written.
my
only
point
is
that
it
does
not
prevent
the
federal
district
court
from
hearing
the
state
administrative
review
claims
in
this
case,
and
i
say
that
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
because
stude
was
a
de
novo
proceeding,
whatever
that
language
means...
and
we
indicate
in
our
brief
what
we
think
it
means.
we
think
it
means,
cannot
separate
the
question
of
damages,
but
whatever
that
language
means,
the
court
could
not
have
been
referring
to
a
case
within
deferential
review,
because
that
was
not
what
the
stude
case
was.
stude
was
a
case
about
de
novo
review,
and
the
court
subsequently
made
clear
in
horton
that
any
case
that
does
require
de
novo
review
is
within
the
original
jurisdiction.
yes,
but
the
opposite
part
of
that
was
that
horton--
--yes--
--the
fair
reading
of
horton,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
if
it
required
deferential
review
there
would
not
have
been
original
jurisdiction.
i...
would
you
say
that
that's
a
permissible
reading
of
horton?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
ms.
solomon.
mr.
brennan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
district
court
does
have
jurisdiction
over
a
civil
action.
we
have
held
that
an
appeal
from
a
federal
administrative
agency
to
the
district
court
is
a
civil
action.
you're
saying
it
should
be
different
if
it's
a
state
admin...
now,
say
why,
just
directly,
if
you
would.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
was
no
specific
jurisdiction
for
them
to
have
jurisdiction
over
appeals
from
federal
agencies.
that
was
found
to
be
a
civil
action,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
do
you
distinguish
sanders
in
that
event,
because
surely
there
was
a
final
agency
action
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
it's
one
thing
to
say
the
facts
are
different
here,
but
you
also
have
to
say
that...
and
it
makes
some
difference
that
the
facts
are
different.
just
to
point
out
to
a
difference
that
doesn't
really
make...
a
distinction
that
doesn't
make
much
difference
i
don't
think
gets
you
there,
and
so
if
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
this
is
an
appellate
proceeding
in
the
district
court,
i
think
you
have
to
distinguish
sanders
in
a
way
that
you
haven't.
if
you're
relying
on
the
definition
of
civil
action
or
something
else,
that
needn't
bother
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
brennan.
ms.
solomon,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
solomon.
the
case
is
submitted.
