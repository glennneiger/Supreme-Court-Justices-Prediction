justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
to
the
extent
this
was
brought
as
a
review
of
a
municipal
agency
decision,
to
the
extent
that
this
was
a
review
of
the
decision
of
the
landmarks
commission,
i
was
struck
by
the
comment
that
the
ninth
circuit
made
in
its
recent
decision
that
the
prospect
of
a
federal
court
sitting
as
an
appellate
court
over
state
administrative
proceedings
is
rather
jarring.
indeed,
it's
so
jarring
that
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
of
a
court
other
than
this
court
sitting
in
direct
review
of
a
state
court
proceeding.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
question
was
the
function
of
lower
appellate
courts
vis-a-vis
state
agencies,
and
even
in
the
federal
question
domain,
i
know
of
no
precedent
where
a
district
court,
or
even
a
court
of
appeals,
sits
as
an
appellate
reviewer
as
distinguished
from...
a
case
might
come
up,
say
on
habeas,
on
collateral
review,
but
to
my
knowledge
only
this
court,
from
the
highest
court
of
the
state,
acts
in
the
direct
review
line,
so
i
don't
know
any
precedent
for
this
court,
for
a
lower
court,
for
a
district
court
sitting
in
direct
review
of
a
decision
of
a
state
agency.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
one
challenges
an
agency
action,
say,
a
liquor
license
or
funeral
home
license,
one
challenges
a
state
or
local
agency
decision
and
normally
brings
up
all
possible
arguments.
it
violates
the
state
law.
it
violates
the
state
constitution.
it
violates
the
federal
constitution.
my
question
really
is,
isn't
the
implication
of
the
argument
you're
making
today
that
every
decision
of
every
licensing
board
in
every
city
can
become...
can
have
a
right
of
initial
access
to
a
federal
forum?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
i
follow...
i
followed
your
argument
and
it
seemed
to
me
that
was
right.
looking
at
1441(c),
which
requires
the
case
to
be
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court,
then
all
of
these
cases
could
start
out...
you're
removing,
but
you
can't
remove
what
couldn't
start
there,
so
am
i
correct
that
as
you
read
the
statute
any
agency
decision
at
the
state
level,
so
long
as
there
is
a
federal
claim
stuck
in
there
by
the
plaintiff,
could
be
begun
in
the
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
would
be
just
as
straightforward.
so
your
point
is,
you
could
remove
whether
the
state
puts
its
review
in
the
middle
tier
or
in
the
court
of
first
instance.
they're
equally
removable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
stop
right
there,
because
there
in
your
prior
statement
seems
to
put
you
out
of
the
1441
territory,
a
civil
action
that
could
originally
be
commenced
in
the
federal
court.
you
have
said
that
it
wasn't
a
civil
action
before
the
landmarks
commission.
it
didn't
become
a
civil
action
until
it
was
commenced
in
a
state
court.
therefore,
doesn't
it
follow
that
it
could
not
have
been
commenced
originally
in
the
federal
court?
it
must
be
commenced
in
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
said
it
doesn't
become
a
federal
case
until
it's
first
filed
in
a
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
now
seem
to
be
saying
they
could
have
gone
from
the
landmarks
commission
directly
into
federal
court,
passing
any
state
court
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
horton
was
filed
initially
in
the
federal
court,
right?
it
wasn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
the
court
there
said,
under
that
texas
scheme,
the
administrative
procedure,
it's
as
though
it
didn't
exist,
because
you
start
it
all
over
in
federal
court,
so
it
wasn't
a
review
of
any
administrative
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
it
could
not
have
originally...
because
a
proceeding
to
review
an
agency
decision,
in
the
views
of
the
seventh
circuit,
could
not
originally
have
been
commenced
in
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
proceeding
to
review
the
landmarks
commission
decision,
it
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
federal
court.
that
was
the
view
of
the
seventh
circuit.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
were
concerned
about
having
access
to
the
federal
forum
on
the
federal
question,
the
due
process
question,
could
you
not
have
done
before
the
state
court
something
comparable
to
what
was
done
in
the
england
case?
that
is
to
say,
state
court,
decide
the
state
law
questions.
they're
prior
anyway,
aren't
they,
because
you
would
not
reach
a
due
process
question
unless
you
said
that
under
the
state
landmarks
commission
law,
or
under
the
city
law,
you
couldn't
do
this,
so
couldn't
you
say...
preserve
your
interest
in
having
the
federal
question
in
federal
court
by
saying,
state
court,
don't
reach
the
federal
question,
we
want
to
preserve
that
ultimately
to
bring
in
federal
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
mean
that,
precisely
that
pattern.
i
mean
the
technique
of
saying,
if
you
want
the
federal
claim
in
federal
court,
but
the
state
claims
are
logically
prior.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
was
really
en
passant
in
sanders,
wasn't
it,
because
the
main
thing
that
was
held
there
was
that
you
didn't
have
1331
review
in
these
social
security
cases
and,
as
i
recall,
didn't
the
chief
write
separately
to
say
there
was
no
need
to
discuss
1331
at
all,
because
the
review
route
under
the
social
security
act
was
205?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
i
meant
was
that
sanders
was
a
social
security
review
case,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
court
said...
the
holding
was
you
don't
have
1331
available
there,
because
you
have
only
205.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
want
to
quibble
about
what
sanders
held
versus
what
it
says
en
passant,
because
you're
unquestionably
right
that
under
the
apa
1331
now,
without
the
amount--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--controversy,
works,
but
do
you
think
that
the
part
when
it
was
talking
about
review
of
federal
agency
decisions
had
in
mind
at
all
that
every
municipal
agency,
every
county
agency,
every
state
agency
by
virtue
of
that
decision
was
going
to
come
into
federal
court
initially
as
a
civil
action?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
it
doesn't,
if,
as
strudesaid...
and
maybe
strude
got
this
point
wrong...
if
it
doesn't
become
a
civil
action
until
it's
lodged
in
a
state
court,
then
it
could
not
have
been
commenced
originally.
it
would
have
to
be
commenced
originally
in
the
state
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why?
the
same
words
mean
different
things
in
different
contexts.
take
arising
under.
it
means
different
things
in
the
statute
than
it
means
when
those
very
same
words
are
used
in
the
constitution.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
relying
on
what
the
strude
case
said
about,
it
doesn't
become
a
civil
action
until
it's
lodged
in
state
court.
justice
minton
thought
that
at
that
point
it
could
be
removed,
but
if
it's...
if
it
doesn't
become
a
civil
action
until
it
must
be
commenced
in
state
court,
then
it
would
not
qualify
as
an
action
that
could
originally
be
brought?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
just
said
you
could
have...
you
could
have
forgotten
all
about
the
state
review
proceeding,
and
you
could
have
brought
a
1983
action.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you
could
have
gone
into
federal
court.
so
suppose
you
just
split
up
this
complaint
and
you
have
one
complaint
that
you
want
review
of
the
land
law
decision.
you
bring
that
in
the
cook
county
court.
and
then
the
other
complaint
is
that
you're
denied
due
process,
and
you
bring
that
in
the
federal
court.
that
you
could
have
done,
couldn't
you
have?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
question
was,
in
califano
was
review
or
not,
not
review
which
court,
because
if
it
was
going
to
be
any
court
it
was
going
to
be
the
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
conceded
that
if
you
had
divided
up
your
complaint...
you
want
review
of
the
land
law
commission
in
state
court,
you
want
your
federal
questions
in
federal
court...
that
you
could
have
done
that,
so
why
can't
the
city
remove
at
least
to
the
extent
that
you
have
a
divisible
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
say
to
the
district
court,
we
can
remove
the
part
that's
pure
federal,
and
for
the
rest,
the
state
claims,
district
court
you
can
either
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
or
remand
those.
why
couldn't
the
city
say,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
there
are
federal
claims
here,
it's
removable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
that
in
sanders,
which
had
its
own
jurisdictional
provision,
the
1331
was
for
cases
where
there
was...
the
nonstatutory
review
cases,
cases
where
there
was
not
a
specific
statute
that
said,
for
example,
railroad
retirement
board
decisions
go
to
the
d.c.
circuit,
not
the
district
court?
no
specific
statute.
but
here
you're
saying
you
do
have
a
specific
statute,
only
it's
a
state
statute,
so
therefore
the
1331
does
not
supplant
a
specific
provision
any
more
than
it
supplanted
205
in
the
social
security
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that's
a
wholly
federal
law
scheme,
and
the
states
are
used...
state
offices
are
used
to
administer
it,
but
the
law
is
federal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
believe
their
position
was
that
it
wouldn't
satisfy...
at
least
that
was
the
implication,
i
think,
of
justice
stevens'
question,
that
it
wouldn't
satisfy
a
separate
and
independent
claim.
if
they're
right
about
the
state
part
being
nonremovable
by
itself--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
the...
there
is
no
separate,
separation
between
those
two
because
they're
so
tied
together
by
the
facts.
