mr.
richard
j.
brennan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
view
of
the
questions
the
court
has
put
to
counsel,
it
strikes
me
that
the
best
place
for
me
to
begin
is
with
the
city's
landmark
ordinance,
which
in
its
specific
provision
of
2-120-810
says
that
final
administrative
decisions
shall
be
appealable
to
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
under
the
illinois
administrative
review
act,
and
what
the
respondents
did
in
this
case
was
exactly
to
follow
that
ordinance,
and
we
filed
a
one-count...
i
mean,
no
count.
the
complaint
was
simply
a
complaint
for
administrative
review,
and
the
elements
of
that
were
very,
very
simple.
we
had
to
file
two
complaints
for
administrative
review,
one
from
the
decision
of
the
commission
denying
the
demolition
permit,
the
second
from
the
commission's
decision
denying
the
economic
hardship
exception,
and
we
also
had
to
file
a
third
action
from
the
decision
of
the
chicago
plan
commission
denying
our
application
under
the
chicago
and
lake
michigan
lake
front
protection
ordinance,
so
we
had
three
cases
that
we
had
to
go
to
court
with
at
that
point.
we
were
well
aware
that
we
might
have
exercised
our
federal
constitutional
rights
by
marching
down
to
the
federal
court
and
filing
an
action
under
1983.
we
chose
not
to
do
that,
very
deliberately.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
no,
we
could
not
have,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--and
the
reason
we
could
not
have
is
because
that
cause
of
action
arises
out
of
a
final
decision
of
an
administrative
agency,
and
therefore
that
case,
if
we
tried
to
file
it--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--if
they
were
combined
together,
if
that
cause
of
action
had
sought
review
of
both
the
adminis...
the
final
decision
and
also
had
a
count
under
1983,
that--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--right.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
and
we
could
not
have
filed
that
because
this
lawsuit,
this
dispute
is
not
a
civil
action
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
because
it
comes
out
of,
it
arises
out
of
a
final
decision
of
an
administrative
agency,
and
so
the
terms
in
the
statutes,
in
the
removal
statute
and
the
jurisdictional
statute,
which
speak
in
terms
of
a
civil
action
of
which
the
court
has
original
jurisdiction,
this
is
not
that
kind
of
a
case.
it's...
it--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--sure.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
your
honor,
i
think
the
answer
is
very
clear
and
is
very
simple,
and
it's
found
in
califano.
in
califano
this
court
found
that
there
was
jurisdiction
to
review
decisions
of
federal
agencies
under
1331
because
congress
had
amended
1331
by
explicitly
providing
that
the
then-required
jurisdictional
amount
was
not
necessary
to
bring
an
action
against
a
federal
agency.
there
is
a
federal
statute
that
says
in
califano
that
actions
can
be
brought
under
1331
challenging
decisions
of
federal
administrative
agencies.
ours
is
a
state
agency.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
i
think
that's
the
import
of
the
holding
in
califano.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
and
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
entire
jurisdictional
language,
which
is
a
civil
action
arising
under
the
original--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--no,
it
says--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--well,
i
think
that's
a
1441(c)
analogy,
but
i
think
in
either
case
the
conclusion
and
the
analysis,
the
correct
analysis
and
the
bar
is
that
this
civil
action
is
not
an
action
of
which
the
district
court
has
original
jurisdiction
because
it
comes
out
of
a
final
decision
of
an
administrative
agency.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
because
all
of
the
jurisdictional
statutes
use
the
phrase,
a
civil
action
of
which
the
district
court
has
original
jurisdiction,
and--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--justice
ginsburg,
as
i
read
stude
and
horton
and
the
four
circuit
courts
of
appeals
that
have
addressed
this
issue,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
initial
inquiry
all
four
of
those
courts
have
made
is,
what
is
the
nature
of
the
action,
and
when
the
action
arises
to
challenge
a
decision
of
a
state
administrative
agency,
it
then
becomes
in
nature
an
appellate
case,
and
is
not
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
i
don't
believe
i
could
have
combined
the
two
of
them
at
all,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
the
action
that
we're
complaining
about,
the
final
decision
of
the
landmarks
commission
is
a
final
decision
which
is
being
attacked
in
a
lawsuit
which
challenges
that
decision,
that
that
makes
it
a
review,
an
appellate
review,
a
deferential
review
of
the
decision
of
the
landmarks
commission,
and
so
the
1983
action,
of
which
the
federal
district
court
might
arguably
have
jurisdiction
if
we
file
that
separately,
would
be
a
de
novo
action.
it
is
then
an...
it
is
a
civil
action
of
which
the
court
has
original
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
but
this
case
is
purely
a
complaint
for
administrative
review
that
seeks
solely
and
exclusively
deferential
review
of
the
final
decision
of
the
landmark--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--yes,
it
is,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
because
the
constitutional
issues
still
arise
out
of
the
decision
and
the
ordinance
and
the
statutes
under
which
that
decision
is
made.
under
illinois
administrative
review
law,
when
the...
when
that...
those
constitutional
issues,
state
or
federal,
get
to
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
they
are
entitled
to
be
reviewed
by
a
de
novo
standard
of
review,
but
nevertheless,
the
action
itself
is
not
a
de
novo
action.
the
nature
of
the
action
is
one
which
is--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--because
he
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
constitutional
claims,
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
the
nature
of
the
complaint,
the
nature
of
the
lawsuit
that
is
filed,
the
essential
facts
and
elements
of
it,
are--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--theoretically
he
could,
your
honor,
but...
but
i
guess
what
i'm
really
saying,
i
mean,
reduced
to
its
simplest
terms,
is
that
the
fact
that
when
the
plaintiff
comes
to
court,
and
in
their
complaint
they're
complaining
about
this
final
decision
of
an
administrative
agency,
that's
the
lawsuit
that's
filed
following
that
action.
the
nature
of
that
lawsuit,
whatever
caption
it's
put
under,
whether
it's
in
one
count
or
two
count,
whether
it
includes
1983
claims
or
not,
it
is
nevertheless
a
cause
of
action
that
arises
out
of
a
final
decision
of
an
administrative
agency,
and
for
that
fact
and
that
fact
alone
it
then
is
not
within
the
original
jurisdiction--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--yes.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
right.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
and
thank
you
for
raising
that,
because
it
really
gets
to
what
i
think
is
the
important
opportunity
that
the
court
has
in
this
case,
and
that
is
an
opportunity
to
avoid,
if
you
will,
all
of
the
litigation
that
comes
under
the
arising
under
cases,
as
to
whether
or
not
this
is
an
action
arising
under,
and
the
abstention
cases.
the
much
better
rule
as
a
matter
of
judicial
policy
that
i
think
this
court
should
adopt
is
the
rule
that
says,
we
do
not
have...
federal
district
courts
do
not
have
appellate
jurisdiction
to
review
final
decisions
of
administrative
agencies.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
so
that
jurisdictional
rule
to
the
practitioners
is
very
clear.
we
don't
get
into
all
the
arguments
that
we
can
in
abstention
cases.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
excuse
me.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
state...
thank
you.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
well--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--there
is
no
gimmick
in
the
statute,
because
when
you're
looking
at
the
jurisdictional
issue
you're
necessarily
looking
for
where
is
jurisdiction
found,
where
is
jurisdiction
conferred
on
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance.
limited
jurisdiction.
burden
is
on
the
plaintiff
who's
attempting...
the
party
who's
attempting
to
get
into
federal
court
to
show
that
there
is
federal
court
jurisdiction.
those
are
all
well-settled
principles.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
and
the--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--because
there
is
no
statutory
authority
for
the
district
court's
to
have
jurisdiction
over
state
administrative--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--it
was
found
to
be
a
civil
action
in
califano
when
the
court
found
that
the
1976
amendments
to
1331,
in
essence
in
the
legislative
history,
and
it's
set
forth
clearly,
i
think,
in
footnote
4
of
the
opinion
to
califano,
basically
says
congress
amended
the
statute
and
took...
and
added
a
provision
which
says
that
actions
under
1331
can
be
filed
as
arising
under
actions
against
federal
agencies
because
they
removed
the
prior--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--no.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
the
existing
jurisdictional
statutes,
any
one
of
the
three
first
provisions
of
1441,
the
removal
statute,
never
speak
to
the
issue
and
never
have
any...
do
not
have
any
language
in
them
that
supports
the
idea
that
district
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
civil
actions
within
their
original
jurisdiction
where
there
are
state
appellate
reviews
involved.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
well,
exactly,
because
it
was
the
action
of
a
federal
agency,
and
the
suit
was
filed
against
the
social
security
administration.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
well--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--because
1441(c)
says
whenever
a
separate
and
independent
claim
or
a
cause
of
action
within
the
jurisdiction
conferred
by
section
1331
is
joined
with
a
nonremovable
action,
and
you
don't...
we
never
pass
the
first
test.
this
is
never
an
action
under
1331,
because
under
1331
it
must
be
a
civil
action
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
yes,
that
is
true,
justice
stevens.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
that's
true.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
correct.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
the
city's
ordinance
expressly
provides
for
that.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
i
think
that
analysis
is
sound,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
it's
sound
because
it
begins
with
the
point
that
this
cause
of
action
arises
in
a
state
statute
in
a
city
ordinance,
and
for
us
to
have
marched
down
to
federal
court
and
tried
to
file
it
there,
most
judges
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois
would
have
dismissed
it
sua
sponte
on
the
grounds
that
this
is
not
a
federal
case.
there
is
no
federal
jurisdictional
statute
that--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--i
think
i'm
saying
two
things,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
thing
i'm
saying
is
that
in
califano
the
court
found
that
there
was
jurisdiction
to
review
the
federal
agency
because
of
the
amendment
that
was
made
in
1976
to
1331.
the
court
did
not
address
at
all
the
issue
of
whether
the
federal
courts
have
original
jurisdiction
over
state
administrative
agency
actions,
and
my
basic
point
is
that
there
is
no
federal
statute
that
one
can
point
to
which
clearly
intends
to
give
the
district
courts
appellate
jurisdiction
over
final
decisions
of
state
administrative
agencies,
and
that
would
include
those
cases
where
there
is
some
federal
constitutional
claim
in
them.
another
reason
why
that
rule
makes
a
great
deal
of
sense
is
that
in
all
these
administrative
review
cases,
whether
they
come
out
of
liquor
agencies
or
aviation
authorities
or
zoning
authorities,
the
federal
constitutional
questions
should
not
be
addressed
until
the
plaintiff
has
failed
to
prevail
on
any
of
the
state
law
issues.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
but--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--well,
stude
stands
for
the
proposition--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--that
state
legislatures
cannot
enact
laws
that
will
confer
jurisdiction
on
federal
courts,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
dispute
about
that.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
the...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
correct
jurisdictional
analysis
is,
what
federal
statutes
gives
the
federal
court--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--jurisdiction
over
this
complaint
for
administrative--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--right,
and
1367,
which
the
city
curiously
relies
on,
not
on
1441(c).
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
it
doesn't
do
it
for
them
because
you
can't
get
over
the
original
hurdle
in
1367,
which
is
that
the
federal
court...
it
must
be
a
civil
action
of
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction,
and--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--i
don't
know,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--yes,
and
in
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion
in
shamrock
motors
they
cite
two
rtc
cases
which
get
into
this
whole
area
of
what
happens
when
legislatures
might
deliberately,
if
you
will,
attempt
to
confer
jurisdiction,
and
i
think
under
the
communications
law
somebody
told
me
there
are
some
of
those.
but
i--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--that's--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--well,
that's
true,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
still
contend
that
the
point
that
gets
me
there
that
says
that
the
district
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
no
provision
in
the
u.s.
code
in
the
removal
statute
or
in
the
jurisdictional
statutes
which
says
or
suggests,
directly
or
indirectly,
that
district
courts
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--to
review
appellate
decisions
of
state
administrative
agencies.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
well,
i
get
to
my
destination
by
saying
that
1331
speaks
about
the
district
courts
having
original
jurisdiction--
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
--of
civil
actions,
and
this
is
not
a
case
involving
original
jurisdiction,
and
going
back
to
stude,
and
horton,
and
the
four
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
the
four
circuits,
it
seems
to
me
what
the
court
in
each
one
of
those
cases
has
done,
as
well
as
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
brief,
is
they
look
at
what
they
characterize
as
the
nature
of
the
action,
and
nature
of
the
action
as
it's
used
there
is,
does
this
case
come
out
of
a
dispute
which
grows
out
of
a
final
decision
of
a
state
administrative
agency?
is
it
an
appellate
decision
of
its
nature,
or
is
it
a
de
novo
decision?
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
sure,
and
i
don't
think...
it
doesn't
appear
to
me
that
sanders
as
filed
was
necessarily
an
appellate
action.
there
are
two
reasons
that
i
think
sanders
is
distinguishable.
the
first
is
that
while
there
was
a
decision
of
the
social
security
administration,
the
action
that
was
filed
was
really
a
de
novo
action
that
challenged
that
decision,
secondly
in
sanders
is
distinguishable,
because
there
you're
talking
about
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
federal
administrative
agencies,
and
i'm
not
troubled
by
that,
and
i
don't
think
the
court
is
troubled
by
that.
that's
not
our
case.
our
case
is
review
of
state
administrative
agencies.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
well,
if...
i
guess
what
i
would
suggest,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
sanders
does
not
in
any
way
support
the
proposition
that
the
city
is
arguing
here
that
state...
that
federal
district
courts
should
have
jurisdiction
over
cases
which
are
of
their
very
nature
appeals
from
state
administrative
agencies.
mr.
richard
j.
brennan
that's
true,
justice
stevens,
and
that's
the
second
point
in
our
brief,
and
we
make
that
point,
that
if
you...
that
if
this
court
were
