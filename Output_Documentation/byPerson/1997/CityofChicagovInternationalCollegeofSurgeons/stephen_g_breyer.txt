justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
it
says
in
1331
is
that
district
courts
shall
have
original
jurisdiction
of
all
civil
actions--
--that's
all
it
says.
--arising
under
the
constitution.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
so
i
think
the
question
was,
or
at
least
mine
would
be,
which
i
think
is
the
same,
how
can
it
be
a
civil
action
if
what
you're
asking
for
is
to
review
a
federal
administrative
agency,
but
suddenly
it
isn't
a
civil
action
when
what
you're
asking
for
is
to
review
a
state
agency?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
absolutely
you're
quite
correct
that
a
state
agency
is
a
civil
action
not
arising
under
the
constitution.
that
is
not
what...
or
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
would
be
in
court
because
it
is
a
civil
action
which
is
removable
because
it
is,
in
fact,
a
claim
so
related
to
claims
in
the
action
that
they're
part
of
the
same
case
or
controversy.
that's
why
it
would
come
in,
not
under
1331.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
then
now
the
question
is,
why
does
that
make
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
your
view,
i'd
like
you
to
expand,
if
you
would,
please,
on
your
response
to
justice
o'connor.
you
said
the
word
theoretically,
sort
of
underlining
theoretically,
and
i
thought
that
was
important
because
i
think
one
of
the
problems
is
whether
this
would
lead
to
a
flood
of
reviews
of
state
court
administrative
cases
in
federal
court.
and
what
i'd
like
you
to
respond
to
is
the
suggestion,
no,
because
the
state
administrative
claims
can
be
remanded
in
any
instance
where
a
judge
has
decided
the
federal
question,
where
they
predominate,
or
for
any
other
fairly
good
reason,
and
by
the
way,
if
the
judge
in
the
federal
court
needs
to
know
the
answer
to
the
state
question
before
he
can
answer
the
federal
one,
pullman
abstention
with
an
england
reservation
if
necessary,
or
if
it's
really
going
to
mix
up
the
state
court
system--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--burford
abstention.
so
we
have
burford,
pullman,
england,
and
three
clauses
in
the
supplemental
jurisdiction--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
that's...
i
don't
know
if
justice
scalia's
idea
is
so
sound.
the...
i
think
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
to
carve
out
some
kind
of
special
box
for
state
administrative
law
cases,
and
i
don't
know
how
you
do
it.
you're
talking
about
the
word
appeal,
as
if
that
might
do
it.
then
you
talk
about
discretionary
review
as
if
that
might
do
it.
but
a
state
could
have
a
law
saying
all
state
laws
applicable
to
state
government
officials
are
always
determined
through
an
appeal
to
a
court,
so
it
can't
just
be
the
word
appeal.
it
would
then
be
possible
to
immunize
every
state
government
action.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
can't
just
be
the
question
of
discretionary
review,
because
i
don't
even
know
what
that
is,
discretionary
review.
i
mean,
you're
trying
to
simplify
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
to
complexify,
if
there
is
such
a
word.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
dispute
about
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
they're
saying
what
does
it
is
13--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--1441,
1367.
that's
the
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
both.
no,
(b)...
(a).
go
ahead.
sorry.
