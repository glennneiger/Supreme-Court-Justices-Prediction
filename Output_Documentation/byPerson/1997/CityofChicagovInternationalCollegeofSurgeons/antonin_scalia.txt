no,
i'm
assuming
the
complaint
is
word-for-word
the
same,
except
the
jurisdictional
allegation's
a
little
different.
say
this
arises
under
federal
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
so
forth
and
so
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
a
precisely
identical
case
involving
the
federal
agency
be
a
civil
action,
whereas
this
is
not
a
civil
action?
it
seems
to
me
its
actionness
is
exactly
the
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
two
situations.
you
may
appeal
to
some
principle
of...
i
don't
know,
states
ought
to
review
their
own
agencies,
but
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
they're
not
equivalently
civil
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
1331
says
that
actions
can
be
brought
challenging
decisions
of
federal
agencies?
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
can
make
up
another
one,
if
necessary.
i
mean,
it's--
[laughter]
that's
why
i
picked
up
on
your
word
theoretically,
because
it
seems
more
than
theoretically.
justice
antonin
scalia
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
we
can't
hold
that
as
you
just
put
it,
because
we
have
held
that
we
have
jurisdiction
to
review
administrative
agencies.
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
administrative--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
now--
--yes,
but
then
you
have
to
tell
me
why
federal
versus
state
makes
one
be
an
action
whereas
the
other
isn't
an
action,
or
makes
one
be
civil
whereas
the
other
isn't
civil.
i
mean,
we
have
to
squeeze
this
theory
within
the
text
of
the
statute,
and
you
haven't
given
me
a,
you
know,
a
gimmick
to
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i'd...
it's
easier
to
invent
a
new
abstention.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
legislative
history
causes
1331
to
have
in
it
some
imaginary
language,
this
applies
only
to
federal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
review
of
federal
administrative
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
brennan,
let
me
try
another
way
of
getting
where
you
want
to
go,
which
seems
to
me
more
feasible.
this
case
is
a...
these
state
administrative
proceedings
are
appealable
to
state
courts
under
a
state
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
says
they
will
be
appealable
to
a
state
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
federal
review
of
federal
administrative
action
is
conducted
under
statutes...
the
apa...
that
give
federal
courts
review,
or
under
special
appeals
statutes
that
give
federal
courts
review,
or
under
mandamus,
and
injunction
before
the
apa.
we
used
to
review
them
just
under
our
general
mandamus
authority.
but
i
don't...
did
we
ever
have
mandamus
authority
to
mandamus
state
officers?
i
doubt
it.
so
maybe
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
not
so
much
a
jurisdictional
defect
as
a
lack
of
cause
of
action
that
the
state
law
created
this
cause
of
action
against
the
state
agency,
and
it
limited
the
bringing
of
that
cause
of
action
to
state
courts.
now,
normally
a
state
cannot
do
that.
if
you
create
a
cause
of
action
i'm
sure
it
can
be...
you
can
bring
it
in
federal
as
well
as
in
state
courts,
but
perhaps
a
different
rule
should
apply
where
the
cause
of
action
is
a
cause
of
action
for
review
of,
effectively
mandamus
review
of
state
officers.
that's
what's
going
on
here.
