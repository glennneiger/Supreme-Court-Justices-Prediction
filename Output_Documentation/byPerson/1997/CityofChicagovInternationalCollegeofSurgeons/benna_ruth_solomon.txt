ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
international
college
of
surgeons
owns
two
of
the
last
seven
remaining
mansions
reflecting
an
illustrious
part
of
history
around
the
turn
of
the
century
in
the
city
of
chicago.
ics
sought
permission
to
demolish
all
but
the
facades
of
the
landmark
four-story
buildings
and
to
build
a
41-story
condominium
in
its
place.
the
city's
landmark
commission
refused
both
the
demolition
permits
and
the
subsequent
requests
for
hardship
exceptions,
and
ics
challenged
both
decisions
in
state
court.
the
city
removed
the
complaints
to
federal
court--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--your
honor,
we
find
that
on
federal
questions
the
federal
courts
have
more
expertise
with
the
questions,
they
tend
to
see
them
more
often,
and
we
find
that
that
gives
us
greater
predictability
as
we
try
to
assess
litigation
risks.
when
there
is
case
law
in
the
federal
courts,
as
there
was
on
all
of
the
federal
claims
that
ics
pled
in
this
case,
we
can
review
that
case
law,
and
we
can
make
a
determination
whether
we
should
litigate
or
whether
we
should
settle.
in
state
court,
because
the
cases
are
not
so
frequently
litigated
there,
there's
a
paucity
of
case
law
on
some
subjects.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
respondents
sought
a
variety
of
things,
your
honor.
respondents
sought
to
have
the
ordinance
declared...
the
landmarks
ordinance
declared
unconstitutional,
to
have
the
specific
ordinance
delegating
ics's
property
as
a
landmark
declared
unconstitutional,
to
have
a
variety
of
state
law
claims
litigated
in
the
first
instance,
they
had
takings
claims,
nondelegation
claims,
vested
rights...
they
had
five
state
law
claims.
they
also
had
two
claims
that
were
presented
on
the
administrative
record,
so
there
were
a
variety
of
claims.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
justice
ginsburg,
the
ninth
circuit
case,
like
the
armistead
case
and
the
fairfax
county
case
that
were
also
recently
decided
in
the
courts
of
appeals,
are
diversity
cases.
they
are
unlike
this
case.
of
all
the
recent
courts
of
appeals
cases
only
this
one
was
removed
to
the
federal
court
on
the
basis
of
federal
questions.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
our
argument
on
that,
your
honor,
is
in
two
parts.
it
is
first
that
the
district
court
had
original
jurisdiction
over
the
civil
claim,
over
the
portion
of
ics's
complaint
that
fell
within
the
district
court's
original
jurisdiction.
ics
pled
numerous
federal
constitutional
violations,
and
on
the
strength
of
those
federal
constitutional
violations,
we
removed
the
case
to
district
court.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
our
argument,
your
honor,
rests
on
the
plain
language
of
section
1441,
which
permits--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--your
honor
is
correct.
we
certainly
make
no
distinction
between
a
case
that
could
be
begun
in
the
federal
district
court,
or
a
case
that
could
be
removed
to
the
district
court.
the
language
of
1331
and
1441
are
certainly
the
same.
but
we
don't
think
that
that
opens
the
floodgates,
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
as
your
honor
points
out,
there
has
to
be
at
least
a
substantial
federal
question
in
the
case,
something
that
would
make
it
a
civil
action.
now,
we
rely
on
the
presence
of
the
substantial
federal
claims
in
this
case
to
say
that
this
was
a
civil
action
within
original
jurisdiction.
we
then
turn
to
section
1367,
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute,
which
provides
the
district
court
with
additional
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
all
other
claims
that
are
related
to
the
claim
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court.
now,
in
the
other
cases,
the
other
courts
of
appeals
cases
that
went...
that
were
removed
on
the
basis
of
diversity,
that
element
might
well
be
lacking.
we
don't
make
an
argument
here
about
the
diversity
cases.
our
argument
is
that,
under
the
plain
terms
of
section
1441,
the
federal
allegations
in
this
complaint
were
a
civil
action
within
original
jurisdiction--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--we
don't
make
that
argument,
justice
o'connor.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
our
answer
is--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--it
was
not.
it
was
a
civil
action
when
a
complaint
was
filed
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
it
was...
under
the
terms
of
the
administrative
review
law
at
that
point,
it
was
a
proceeding
to
review
a
final
decision,
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
made
clear,
and
the
seventh
circuit
discloses
this
in
its
opinion,
that
under
illinois
law
additional
claims
may
be
brought
to
the
circuit
court
along
with
the
claims
for
administrative
review.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
at
a
minimum,
your
honor,
yes.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
well,
the
term
civil
action,
as
we
describe
in
our
brief,
is
a
historical
term.
the
components
civil
and
action
are
well-described
in
this
court's
cases.
civil
is
used
only
in
contradistinction
to
something
that
is
criminal,
so
the
case
was
clearly
a
civil
action.
it
was
clearly
civil.
let
me
say
that.
it
was
also
an
action,
as
the
court
described,
for
example,
in
the
upshur
case
and
a
variety
of
the
other
cases.
an
action
is
one
before
a
judicial
tribunal,
between
the
parties,
seeking
a
remedy
that
is
provided
by
law.
there
is
no
question
that
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county
this
was
a
civil
action.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
justice
kennedy,
it
might
be
different
in
some
other
situations,
but
what
we
have
here
in
this
case
was
a
complaint
filed
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county,
and
at
that
point
we
filed
a
notice
of
removal
to--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
would
see
no
basis
for
saying
that
that
was
something
other
than
a
civil
action.
if
it's
civil
as
opposed
to
criminal,
and
if
it
is
an
action,
as
the
court
has
described,
as
i
said,
in
a
variety
of
cases--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
would
see
no
reason
why
it
could
not
be,
but
of
course
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
was
a
straightforward
removal
from
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--our
point,
your
honor,
yes,
is
that
any...
by
the
plain
terms
of
section
1441,
a
statute
that
congress
wrote
providing
for
the
removal
jurisdiction,
a
civil
action
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--we
don't
see
that,
justice
ginsburg.
what
we
see
is
that
at
the
point
that
ics
was
attempting
to
decide
how
to
obtain
judicial
review
of
the
landmark
commission's
decisions
denying
it
demolition
permits
and
denying
it
hardship
exceptions
in
part
on
the
grounds
that
they
alleged
that
it
violated
the
takings
clause,
the
equal
protection
clause,
the
due
process
clause,
that
the
landmarks
ordinance
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face,
it
was
unconstitutional
as
applied,
at
the
point
that
they
were
deciding
how
to
obtain
judicial
review,
they
could
have
drafted
the
complaint
that
appears
in
the
joint
appendix
in
this
case,
they
could
have
walked
down
the
street
to
the
federal
district
court,
and
they
could
have
filed
that
complaint
there
invoking
the
federal
district
court's
original
jurisdiction
over
the
federal
claims.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
right.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i'm
sorry
if
i
was
unclear,
justice
ginsburg.
what
i
intended
to
say
is
that
at
the
point
where
the
action
is
going
to
be
filed
in
court,
it
is
at
a
minimum
at
that
point
a
civil
action.
it
is
civil
in
nature,
and
it
is
an
action
between
the
parties.
it
is
seeking
a
remedy
from
a
judicial
tribunal.
these
are
the
factors
that
the
court
has
historic--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--your
honor,
we
do
take
that
position,
and
i
don't
think
it's
counter
to
the
stude
case,
if
i
could
explain.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
the
stude
case,
as
you
are
aware,
had
two
portions,
one
seeking
an
original
filing
in
the
district
court
and
the
other
seeking
removal
on
the
basis
of
diversity.
as
for
the
removal
portion,
the
court
indicated
it
could
not
be
removed
because
under
federal
law,
regardless
of
how
iowa
labeled
the
parties,
under
federal
law
the
railroad
was
the
plaintiff,
and
the
plaintiff
could
not
remove.
as
for
the
other
portion,
the
portion
originally
filed
within...
filed
as
a
diversity
action
in
the
district
court,
the
court
indicated
that
the
defect
in
that
case
was
simply
that
the
railroad
was
attempting
to
obtain
review
only
of
the
question
of
damages.
it
was
attempting
to
separate
the
question
of
damages
from
the
underlying
liability.
and
the
court
is
very
clear
about
this,
because
in
the
first
portion
of
the
court's
opinion
it
says,
in
terms,
it
could
have
been
removed
by
the
defendant
if
it
had
really
been
by
the
defendant,
and
that
dicta
in
stude,
of
course,
became
the
holding
of
horton,
that
a
federal
defendant...
i'm
sorry,
a
defendant
on
a
federal
ques...
in
a
diversity
case...
excuse
me
again...
can
remove
a
state
administrative
action.
that
was
the
holding
of
horton.
filed...
it
could
file
it
in
the
district
court
invoking
diversity
jurisdiction,
that
it
would
be
a
civil
action
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--horton
was
filed...
i
misspoke,
your
honor.
it
was
a
diversity
case.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--that
is
why
the
parties
here
agree--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--this
case
is
the
first
case
to
come
before
the
court
seeking
either
removal
or
an
original
filing
of
a
case
that
includes,
as
one
component...
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
that.
it
includes,
as
one
component,
a
portion
that
could...
that
by
state
law
is
reviewed
on
the
record.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
that
is,
of
course,
correct,
your
honor.
our
point
is
simply
that
it
was
a
civil
action
within
the
meaning
of
1441.
it
was
removable
because
of
that
provision.
once
removed,
the
district
court
obtained
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
all
related
state
claims.
ics
does
not
argue
that
it's
administrative
review
claims
were
not
claims.
it
does
not
argue
that
they
were
not
related
to
the
federal
claims,
and
the
plain
terms
of
section
1367
contain
no
qualifier
for
de
novo
or
original
claims.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i
don't
believe
you
do,
your
honor,
but
the
abstention
in
any
event...
abstention
doctrine
recognizes
jurisdiction.
the
seventh
circuit's
holding,
of
course,
was
that
federal
district
court
lacked
jurisdiction
over
the
action,
because--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
think
more
precisely,
your
honor,
it
is
that
because
one
portion
of
the
complaint
would
not
be
reviewed
de
novo--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--and
as
a
result,
none
of
it
could.
the
seventh
circuit's
view
was
that
this
was
not
a
civil
action
within
original
jurisdiction
because
of
the
mere
presence
within
the
case
of
one
portion
that
would
be
reviewed
on
the
record,
and
we
think
that
is
faulty
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
england
reservation,
it
is
a
basis
to
avoid
decision
of
the
federal
claims
of...
if
the
state
claims
are
remanded,
not
as
an
original
matter
within
the
state
court,
but--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--there
are
a
variety
of
techniques
that
are
available
to
the
district
courts
to
avoid
deciding
the
state
law
claims.
the
abstention
doctrines
are
always
available.
section
13--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
think
that's
right,
justice
o'connor.
i
do
not
know
any
way
of
saying
to
the
state
court,
although
these
claims
are
present
before
you,
and
although
they
have
not
been
removed--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--nor
even
any
requirement
like
the
pullman
doctrine
that
the
state
courts
should
not
decide
constitutional
questions
first.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i
would
until
you
get
to
califano
v.
sanders,
your
honor,
and
califano
v.
sanders
clearly
holds
that
federal
administrative
review
actions
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
which
in
the
vast,
vast
majority
of
cases
require
deferential
review,
are
civil
actions
within
original
jurisdiction
under
1331.
that's
the
holding
of
califano
v.
sanders,
and
if
that
is
incorrect,
as
the
court
held
in
califano,
there
simply
is
no
basis
under
which
to
review--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--the
question
in
califano,
your
honor,
as
we
understand
it
was,
is
there
jurisdiction
under
the
administrative
procedure
act
itself,
and
in
that
sense
the
court
did
kind
of
back
into
the
discussion
on
1331.
perhaps
that's
what
you
mean
by
en
passant.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
the
whole--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--that
was
the
factual
situation,
your
honor.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
the
holding
as
we
understand
it,
your
honor,
is
that
you
don't
have
administrative
jurisdiction
directly
under
the
administrative
procedure
act,
and
that
was
the
question
the
court
granted
certiorari
on
because
it
was
a
conflict
in
the
circuits
on
that
question.
and
the
court
says,
well,
you
know,
we
actually
don't
have
to
decide
that
any
more,
because
since
we
granted
certiorari
the
congress
has
amended
1331
to
delete
the
jurisdictional
amount,
and
whatever
impediment
there
might
have
been
before,
there
isn't
now,
we
read
section
31
as
conferring
jurisdiction
on
the
district
courts
to
hear
these
administrative
review
cases,
and--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--right,
and--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--well,
of
course,
the
court
was
construing
the
statute
there,
and
we
are
attempting
to
do
that
here
as
well.
we're
attempting
to
construe
the
words
in
section
1331
which
said,
civil
action
within
original
jurisdiction.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i
hope
i
haven't
confused
the...
our
argument
here.
the...
what
the
cases
say,
and
upshur
is
one
of
the
best
expositions
of
it,
is
that
there
comes
a
point
in
the
proceeding
where
something
is
a
civil
action,
and
it...
at
the
point
where
it
would
be
filed
in
court
it
could
be
filed
in
federal
court,
it
could
be
filed
in
state
court
and
removed.
we
certainly
make
no
argument
that
1331
and
1341
should
not
be
read
as
two
sides
of
the
same
coin.
our
point
is
that,
under
1331,
we
know
the
district
courts
are
jurisdictionally
competent
to
hear
deferential
review
actions.
they
hear
them
every
day
of
the
week.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
i
think,
your
honor,
the
simple
answer
is
because
the
language
won't
allow
it.
the
language
says,
a
civil
action
within
original
jurisdiction.
it
makes
no
difference--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--but
these
are
two
jurisdictional
statutes,
1341,
and
if
ever
there
is
a
reason
and
a
place
to
be
clear
about
the
meaning,
it
is
in
the
jurisdictional
statutes,
otherwise
you
have
people
litigating
to
judgment
only
to
find
out
they
were
in
the
wrong
court.
we
don't
resist
the
abstention
doctrines
as
far
as
they
go.
our
point
about
them
is
simply
that
it
is
not
a
denial
of
jurisdiction
in
those
cases.
abstention
will
come
into
play
in
appropriate
cases,
perhaps
the
vast
majority
of
the
cases,
but--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--i
am.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
as
well
as
the...
as
other
abstention
doctrines.
and
with
that
i'll
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i'd
like
to
make
two
brief
points
in
rebuttal.
the
first
is
that
our
primary
submission
here
is
in
reliance
on
section
1441,
which
allows
for
removal
of
any
civil
action
within
original
jurisdiction,
and
with
the
reference
to
the
federal
constitutional
allegations
in
the
complaints
which
would
be
reviewed
de
novo
as
to
the
law
and
fact
in
the
circuit
court
of
cook
county.
as
ics
concedes,
that
portion,
at
least,
they
could
have
filed
in
federal
court.
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
we--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--1441(c)
we
think
comes
into
play
only
if
1441(a)
is
not
sufficient,
and
we
think
1441(a)
is
sufficient.
civil
action
within
original
jurisdiction
coupled
with
supplemental
jurisdiction
under
1367,
and
that--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--arising
under--
ms.
benna
ruth
solomon
--our
response
to
that
quite
simply
is
the
gully
test,
the
gully
test
of
arising
under
any
right
or
immunity
as
in
the
claims
that
<ics>
[=
ics]
alleged
in
this
case,
the
federal
constitutional
claims
would
be
decided
solely
by
reference
to
the
federal
constitution.
they're
not
decided
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
the
arising
under
cases,
where
a
court
considers
a
state
cause
of
action
and
finds
that
it
does
not
arise
under,
as
we
read
the
cases
are
limited
to
two
circumstances,
first
where
the
plaintiff
actually
forgoes
any
federal
claims,
and
ics
did
nothing
if
not
plead
numerous
federal
constitutional
claims.
the
second
is
the
situation
in
merrell
dow,
where
federal
law
intentionally
precluded
a
right
of
action,
or
there
was
no
federal
right
of
action,
and
there
was
a
federal
right
of
action
for
each
and
every
constitutional
allegation
that
ics
pled
in
its
complaint.
the
only
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
dismissed
the
entire
case
was
that
the
mere
presence
in
the
complaint
of
some
few
claims
that
would
be
reviewed
on
the
record
required
it
to
remand
the
entire
case.
even
ics
does
not
embrace
that
theory
of
contagion,
and
for
good
reason,
because
the
federal
claims
were
within
the
district
court's
original
jurisdiction,
and
the
state
law
claims
were
within
the
district
court's
supplemental
jurisdiction,
and
they
were
all
properly
decided
in
the
district
court.
thank
you.
