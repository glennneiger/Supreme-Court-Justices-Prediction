justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
is
it
your
position
that
the
complaint
for
administrative
review
that
you
just
did...
that
you
did
file,
if
you
just
changed
the
caption
of
it
as...
called
it
civil
action
in
federal
court
under
1983,
or
something
like
that,
that
had
exactly
the
same
allegations
in
it,
could
you
have
filed
it
originally
in
the
united
states
district
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
the
aspects
of
it
in
which
you
allege
the
ordinances
are
unconstitutional
under
both
the
federal
and
state
constitution
on
their
face?
justice
john
paul
stevens
moreover,
isn't
it
true,
as
i
read
the
complaint,
that
most
of
your
federal
claims
are...
overlap
state
law
claims
that
would
be
based
on
precisely
the
same
factual
disputes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
you
couldn't
really
say
there's
a
series
of
federal
claims
involving
facts
a,
b,
and
c,
and
state
claims
involving
d,
e,
and
f.
the
same
facts
are
going
to
be
involved
in
both
the
state
and
federal
claims.
is
that
not
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
really--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
seems
to
me
your
argument
really
begs
the
question.
it
doesn't
necessarily
mean
you're
wrong,
but
the
question
as
i
see
it
is
whether
this
is
a
civil
action
arising
under
the
constitution
and
laws
and
so
forth
of
the
united
states.
and
it
seems
to
me
you
might
arguably
take
the
position
that
there's
a
distinction
between
civil
actions
arising,
et
cetera,
on
the
one
hand
and
federal
claims
on
the
other,
and
it
may
well
be
that
an
action
that
arises
under
a
state
statute
like
this,
even
though
it
includes
federal
claims,
does
not
arise
under
the
federal,
so
forth
and
so
on,
within
the
meaning
of
that
provision.
if
you
don't
take
that
position,
i
don't
know
how
you
get
to
your
destination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right--
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
your
key
distinction
should
not
be
the
distinction
between
appellate
and
original,
but
rather
between
arising
under
federal
law
on
the
one
hand
and
arising
under
state
law
on
the
other.
it
seems
to
me
you
might
make
a
colorable
argument
that
this
case,
notwithstanding
the
presence
of
federal
claims,
really
arises
under
the
state
administrative
review
statute,
and
therefore
it
doesn't
come
within
1331.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
it
doesn't
arise
under,
they
don't
have
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what's
your
response
to
my
argument?
do
you
understand
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
suggested
reading,
that
although
the
claim
is
a
federal
claim,
that
the
viewing
the
action
as
a
whole
as
distinguished
from
claims
in
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute...
you
use
the
word
claims,
not
actions...
that
the
action
itself
didn't
arise
under
the
federal
law.
