justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
becomes
a
civil
action
at
the
first
time
that
it
goes
to
a
state
court
of
general
jurisdiction?
i
mean,
is
that
what
we--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that,
to
follow
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
earlier
questions,
and
she
indicated
that
this
was
jarring,
in
california
as
in
some
other
states
there
are
certain
agencies
whose
findings
are
conclusive,
and
review
is
then
in
the
state
court
of
appeals,
so
that's
the
point
at
which,
when
the
aggrieved
party
goes
to
the
state
court
of
appeals,
there
could
be
an
action
in
united
states
district...
it
could
be
removed
to
the
united
states
district
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
instance
i
explained,
where
you
go
from
the
agency
directly
to
the
three-judge
court
of
appeals
in
california.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
state
system,
and
as
i
understand
your
argument,
at
that
point
the
defendant
could
remove
to
a
united
states
district
court.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
can
remove.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
has
the
congress
provided,
under
the
education
with...
for
disabilities
act,
review
from
state
administrative
agencies
in
the
united
states
district
courts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
they...
it
seemed
to
me
that
might
help
you
in
one
sense,
that
if
congress
wants
this
sort
of
scheme,
whether
it's
federal
law
or
state
law
or
a
combination,
it
can...
it
can
provide
so
by
specific
exemption,
and
that
would
follow
your
legislative
history
argument
with
reference
to
califano.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
if
that
gets
you
there.
