well,
but
may
i
interrupt
you
there?
they
are
competent
at
least
on
the
assumptions
that
califano
was
making,
but
the
one
feature
here
that
califano
didn't
have,
and
the
one...
i
guess
the
feature
which
is
perhaps
more
jolting
to
me
than
others,
is
that
even
though
the
review
is
deferential,
it's
still
a
deferential
review
which
ultimately
turns
on
making
value
judgments
on
state
policy,
aesthetic
judgments
about
the
character
of
the
neighborhood
here,
economic
judgments
about
hardship.
and
if,
in
fact,
that
is
going
to
be
a
constant
feature
of
the
cases
in
the
class
that
we're
talking
about
here,
so
that
there
would
be
a
good
argument,
for
example,
for
abstention
of
those
particular...
on
those
particular
issues,
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
good
reason
for
us
to
recognize
a
different
meaning
for
civil
action
so
that
we
would
not
constantly
be
dragging
these
state
review
cases
into
the
court
only
to
be
faced
with
an
abstention
claim?
