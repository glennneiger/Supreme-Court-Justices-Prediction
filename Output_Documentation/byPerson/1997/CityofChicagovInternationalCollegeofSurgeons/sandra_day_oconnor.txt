that's
a
little
odd,
isn't
it?
why
did
the
city
want
to
take
it
out
of
state
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
was
a
mix
of
issues.
there
was
a...
chicago
wanted
presumably
to...
well,
the
respondents,
i
guess,
had
sought
administrative
review
of
the
decision.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
at
what
point
did
it
become
a
civil
action?
was
it
such
when
it
was
still
in
the
hands
of
the
commission?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
is
your
answer?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
it
a
civil
action
at
that
stage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it--
--but
as
to
that
portion,
i
guess
the
supplemental
jurisdiction
statute,
section
1367
of
title
28,
would
enable
the
federal
district
court,
if,
in
fact,
this
is
removable
there,
to
decline
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
the
administrative
review
claims.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
understood
justice
ginsburg
to
be
interested
in
what
the
state
court
could
do
to
go
ahead
and
resolve
state
issues
and
not
decide
the
federal
law
questions,
but
i
suppose
the
state
court
wouldn't
have
to
refrain.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there's
no
federal
rule
that
says,
state
court
you
have
to
lay
off
because
the
city
of
chicago
doesn't
want
you
to
hear
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
when
you
talk
about
abstention,
are
you
talking
about
exercise...
about
declining
to
exercise
supplemental
jurisdiction--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
section
1367?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
is
that
true
of
the
constitutional
issues
that
are
raised?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
is
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
but
those
constitutional
law
issues
are
resolved
de
novo.
we
just
don't
know
how
the
administrative
review
part
is
going
to
come
out.
now,
why
couldn't
the
federal
court,
if
the
case
is
removed
to
federal
court
why
can't
the
federal
court
judge
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
these
related
state
claims?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
know
that's
your
position,
but
if
you're
wrong,
presumably
the
district
court
judge
could
simply
decline
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
these
state
law
matters.
