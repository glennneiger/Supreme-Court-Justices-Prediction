mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
issue
in
this
case
is
under
what
circumstances
is
a
parent
corporation
directly
liable
through
its
own
acts
as
an
operator
of
a
facility
under
cercla?
this
is
a
case
of
statutory
construction.
congress,
to
carry
out
its
intent
to
have
those
responsible
for
causing
pollution
at
a
facility
responsible
to
remediate
it
created
a
system
that
holds,
among
others,
"any
person
who
owned
or
operated.
"
a
facility
liable
for
cleanup
of
that
facility.
it
is
a
direct
liability
standard.
owner
or
operator
is
a
defined
term
in
the
statute.
a
pertinent
part
of
the
definition,
any
person
who
operates
the
facility,
is
circular,
and
so
according
to
the
teachings
of
this
court
must
be
given
its
common
and
ordinary
meaning.
the
dictionary
definition
of
operate
is
in
the
context
of
an
industrial
facility
any
person
who
exercises
managerial
control
over
that
industrial
plant,
and
we
think
that
this
is
the
appropriate
test
to
apply
here.
under
cercla,
the
term
any
person
is
given
a
broad
definition
and
includes
any
corporation,
whether
a
parent
or
a
subsidiary.
thus--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--we
would
absolutely
agree
with
that.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
that
is
exactly
correct,
justice
o'connor.
it
would
not
determine
it.
the
fact
that
there
are
interlocking
directorships
may
be
an
evidentiary
factor
in
determining
whether
the
parent
corporation
is
operating
the
facility.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
justice
o'connor,
what
we're
talking
about
here,
and
which
is
consistent
with
the
common
law,
is
what
the
action
of
the
parents
are
as
a
company
toward
the
facility,
not
what
the
actions
of
the
parent
are
toward
the
subsidiary,
and
while
there
may
be
useful
evidence
in
how
the
parent
acts
toward
the
subsidiary,
the
real
question
is,
how
did
the
parent
company
directly
affect
or
actively
participate
in
the
management
of
the
facility.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
well,
let
me
start
first
with
the
district
court,
justice
kennedy.
what
the
district
court
did
is
make
very
detailed
and
extensive
factual
findings
that
included
information
about
the
activities
of
the
parent
toward
the
subsidiary,
but
was
in
no
way
limited
to
that.
for
example,
there
were
specific
factual
findings
made
about
mr.
williams,
who
was
a...
an
employee
of
the
parent
company,
and
the
actions
he
had
toward
pollution-related
activities
at
the
facility
that
was
operated
by
the
subsidiary.
the...
it's
easy
to
confuse
here,
because,
in
fact,
for
much
of
the
time
at
issue
the
subsidiary
companies
operated
only
a
single
facility.
ott
ii
operated
the
facility
at
muskegon,
michigan.
for
3
years
it
was
its
only
activity.
for
the
remaining
4
years
that
ott
ii
was
active
here
it
owned
one
other
facility
in
north
carolina,
but
all
of
the
evidence
the
district
court
looked
at
went
to
the
facility
in
michigan.
similarly,
as
to
the--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--your
honor,
it
may
be
instructive
to
look
at
some
of
the
specific
findings
that
the
district
court
made,
keeping
in
mind,
again,
that
for
much
of
the
time,
or
for
a
substantial
part
of
the
time
the
subsidiary
owned
only
this
one
facility,
so
that
when
we're
talking
about...
when
the
district
court
was
talking
about
activities
of
the
subsidiary
it
was
really
talking
about
activities
at
this
particular
facility.
but
for
example,
at
petitioner's
appendix
75a,
where
there
are
facts
about
the
activities
of
mr.
williams,
it
talked
about
mr.
williams
instructed
ott
ii
officials
to
limit
cooperation
with
state
and
federal
regulators
regarding
waste
disposal,
plainly
implicitly
at
this
facility,
and
to
consult
with
cpc
before
responding
to
regulatory
questionnaires
or
other
inquiries.
there
are
also
a
list
of
the
pertinent...
some
of
the
findings
that
the
district--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--mr.
williams
was
not
an
ott
board
member,
your
honor.
mr.
williams
was
simply
an
employee
of
cpc.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
we
do
not
think
the
case...
it
would
be
a
different
set
of
facts,
your
honor,
but
we
do
not
think
the
outcome
would
be
particularly
different,
because
we
think
what
is
probative
and
what
the
standard
is
is,
did
the
parent
company
participate
in
management
of
the
facility,
and
the
activities
of
mr.
williams
were
such
that--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--it's
a
very
fact-specific
test,
your
honor,
but
it
is
likely
that
it
would
meet
it.
we
can
get
some
helpful
guidance
from
the
lender
liability
provisions
of
this
statute,
which
were
added
in
1996
by
congress
and
which
defined
participation
in
management,
and
what
they
look
at
is
the
particular
act...
it
is
congress
giving
content
to
the
concept
participation
and
management
in
the
context
of
banks
or
lenders,
but
they
provide
helpful
guidance
for
any
corporation
that
is
actively
participating
in
management.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
i
have
two
responses
to
that,
justice
souter.
the
district
court
made
specific
findings
about
something
called
the
cpc
development
company,
which
was
a
division
of
cpc,
and
while
some
of
the
people
involved
at
the
cpc
development
company
were
related
to
the
ott
ii
facility,
the
court
indicates
that
not
all
of
them
were.
in
addition--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--the
district
court's
findings
go
to
the
cpc
development
company
as
an
entity,
not...
one
i
believe
can't
discern
from
the
facts--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--there
was
no
one
else
singled
out
particularly,
but
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
district
court's
findings,
which
talk
about
cpc,
not...
in
a
number
of
instances,
not
cpc's
officers,
not
cpc's
managers,
cpc
itself,
don't...
doesn't...
the
court
doesn't
directly
say
that
its
finding
that
those
officers
and
managers
were
acting
when
they
were
involved
with
the
ott
facility
as
in
their
cpc
capacity,
but
it
certainly
is
the
sensible
reading
and
the
implicit
reading
we--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--if
the
legal...
the
legal
standard
we're
espousing
is
that
it
is
cpc
that
is
actively
managing
the
facility.
if
the
question
is
whether
the
district
court's
findings
that
talk
about
cpc
really
mean
that
it
is
ott
that's
taking
the
actions,
in
fact
the
court
specifically
talks
about
cpc
itself,
and
we
think
that,
and
particularly
the
facts
that
are
listed
at
pages
11
and
12
of
our
opening
brief,
underscore
that
it
is
the
parent
company
that
is
operating
the
facility
within
the
meaning
of
operate.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
your
honor,
the
legal
standard
is,
was
the
parent
company
acting
at
the
facility,
and
the
district
court
findings
which
talk
about
cpc
managing
and
controlling
and
operating
at
the
facility
don't
give
the
court
an
easy
line
but
they
certainly
give
the
court
a
base,
a
basis,
with
these
extensive
findings
of
fact,
for
determining
that
it
was
the
parent
company
that
was
undertaking
the
operation.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
we
think
that
this
is
not
the
same
as
any...
as
the
typical
parent
of
the
typical
corporation,
because
cpc
here
was
undertaking
much
more
active
involvement.
under
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
it
was
making
managerial
decisions
about
waste
handling,
it
was
making
managerial
decisions
about
a
number
of
other
operative
aspects
of
the
facility,
and
that
when
the
district
court
findings
talk
about
cpc,
not
cpc's
officers,
not
cpc's
directors,
though
it
does
that,
too,
but
cpc
specifically,
it
was
indicating
that
the
cpc
officers,
managers,
and
directors
who
were
active
at
the
ott
facility
were
there
with
their
cpc
hat
on,
not
with
the
ott--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--your
honor,
what
we
have
is
very
detailed
findings
of
the
district
court
about
the
day-to-day
involvement
and
the
overall
managerial
involvement
of
cpc
at
the
ott
ii
facility.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
not
that
were
in
the
district
court
findings,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
when
congress
enacted
cercla
in
1980
it
enacted
a
broad
statute
that
defined
any
person
in
a
broad
way
certainly
to
include
a
parent
company
if
the
parent
company
was
actively
managing
the
facility.
there
has
been
over
the
past
5
years
a
lot
of
activity
in
congress
looking
at
superfund
reauthorization
and
to
my
knowledge
this
issue
has
not
come
up.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
justice
scalia...
and
this
is...
we
think
that
each
statute
needs
to
be
looked
at
in
its
own
terms
for
what
it
does.
here,
congress
used
the
term
operate
and
operator.
the
dictionary
definitions
of
those
have,
for
industrial
plants
have
a
concept
of
managerial
control.
congress
also
was
helpful
in
the
lender
context
in
using
the
words,
participate
in
management,
which
are
helpful,
but
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
this
issue
have
used
slightly
different
verbal
formulations.
they
come
down
to
the
same
idea,
which
is--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--operate
is
the
term
that
congress
used
in
this
statute,
and
defined
to
mean
operate
so
that--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--we
do
not
think
this
is
a
situation
where
what
is
the
key
test
is
the
relationship
between
the
parent
and
the
subsidiary,
which
is
what
veilpiercing
gets
to,
but
rather
what
is
the
relationship
of
the
parent
company
or
any
company
to
the
facility,
to
the
activities
that
are
causing
the
pollution
that
then
is
leading
to
the
cleanup,
or
to
the
activity
of
managing
the
whole
facility,
even
without
regard
to
the
pollution,
but
which
leads
to
the
causing
of
the
pollution.
what
your
honor
is
describing
is
the
corporate
veil
standard
which,
when
it's
pierced,
is
pierced
for
all
purposes,
which
goes
to
the
relationship
between
the
parent
and
the
subsidiary.
what
we
are
looking
at
is
the
relationship
of
the
parent
company
to
the
site,
to
the
site
where
the
pollution
is
being
caused.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
it...
there
are
not
specific
factual
findings
as
to
that,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
the
district
court
findings
talk
about
each
of
those
people
and...
who
served
at
the
same
time--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--as
both
on
the
parent
and
on
the
subsidiary.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
i
don't
have
a
recollection.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
i
think
it
would
be
a
factor,
your
honor,
but
even
if
the
salaries
were
being
paid
by
the
subsidiary,
if
what
the
people
were
doing
is
acting
in
their
capacity
as...
for
the
parent,
and
were
making
managerial
decisions
at
the
facility,
then
it
would
really
be
the
parent
who--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--it
would
certainly
be
a
factor,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
facts
here--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--what
we
know
as
to
mr.
williams
is
that
he
always
worked
for...
he
was
an
employee
of
cpc,
and
there's
no
indication
in
the
record
that
he
was
in
the
employ
of
ott
ii,
the
subsidiary.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
it
is
our
view,
your
honor,
that
there
were
extensive
factual
findings
in
the
district
court
that
under
rule
52(a)
they
were
left
undisturbed
by--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--yes,
it
is,
because
our
view
of
the
law
is
essentially
what
the
district
court
applied
to
its
fact-findings.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
under
the
standard
that
we
propose,
your
honor,
if
mr.
or
mrs.
smith...
if
mrs.
smith
made
active
managerial
decisions--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--any
facility
can
have
more
than
one
operator,
your
honor,
and
it
is
our
view
that
if
mr.
and
mrs.
smith
themselves
personally
operated
the
facility,
that
is,
actively
participated
in
the
management
of
the
facility,
that
they
would
be
liable.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
there
was,
your
honor.
donahey
v.
bogle
was
that
case,
and
the
sole
shareholder
also
ran
the
place.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
congress
did
say
two
things,
your
honor.
one
is
that
it
defined
any
person
in
a
broad
fashion
to
include
a
corporation
or
to
include
individuals.
it
was
not
looking
at
the
corporate
form,
but
rather
at
the
reality
of
what
was
happening,
and
secondly
it
began
the
section
107
liability
provision
by
saying,
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
law
and
subject
only
to
three
specified
defenses
in
the
statute.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
your
honor,
the...
in
the...
i'm
not
particularly
aware
of
any
other
case,
but
decisions
of
this
court
under
other
statutes
have
looked
beyond
corporate
form
to
what
is
actually
going
on
here,
and
here
congress
was
particularly
concerned
that
those
who
were
making
decisions
that
caused
the
pollution
would
bear
the
economic
responsibility
for
cleaning
it
up.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
the
sixth
circuit
really
looked
at
the
concept
of
derivative
liability.
that
is,
when
is
the
parent
company
responsible
for
actions
of
the
sub.
what
congress
did
in
the
superfund
law
is
look
at
the
direct
liability
of
the
parent,
which
is
really
consistent
with--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--your
honor,
we
think
that
operate
is,
indeed,
defined
in
a
circular
way,
and
we
looked
at
the
dictionary,
but
we
think
the
court
can
get
some
good
guidance
from
the
lender
liability
provisions
adopted
in
the
lender
context,
but
which
spell
out
a
set
of
standards
for
how
much
activity
and
operation
is
necessary
to
meet
the
standard.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
it
would
not
be...
it
would
be
very
rare,
your
honor,
because
the
ordinary
corporation
which
is
acting
in
a
supervisory
capacity
through
a
subsidiary
and
not
with
active
management
would
not
be
liable--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--yes,
and--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--we
believe
that
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
we
do
not
think
they
are
liable,
your
honor.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
because
the
concept
is
participation
in
management,
and--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--not
in
management.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
right.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
if
it
was
a
small
facility
and
they
were
the
managers,
they
would
be
liable.
if
they're
the
fourth
tier
employees
and
not
the
managers,
they
would
not
be.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder--
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
--that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor,
and
we
think
that
our
theory
is
consistent
with
respecting
the
corporate
form
because
it
looks
at
what
is
the
corporation
doing
for
its
own
activities.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
the
test
is
participation
in
management.
if
there
is
a
maverick
employee
who
midnightdumps
in
the
back
40,
we
would
look
at
the
activities
of
that
particular
person,
but
if
the
people
are
working
for
the
corporation,
following
the
orders
of
management,
then
we...
it
is
the
management
and
not
the
individual
employees
who
would
be
liable.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
in
fact,
what
the
cases
that
look
at
shareholder
liability
really
are
taking
people
who
are
shareholders
and
chief
executive
officers
and
really
are
the
active
managers.
ms.
lois
j.
schiffer
we
think
that
is
what
congress
intended
by
its
definition
of
the
term,
operator,
to
assure
that
those
who
are
responsible
for
the
pollution
are
responsible
for
cleaning
it
up,
your
honor.
