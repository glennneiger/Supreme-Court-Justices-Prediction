unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
schiffer,
surely
you
would
agree
that
under
the
statute
not
every
parent
is
liable
under
this
statute
for
the
operation
of
a
facility
by
a
subsidiary.
unknown
speaker
and
there
mere
fact
that
there
are
interlocking
directorships,
or
perhaps
managers
who
serve
both
corporations,
wouldn't
determine
that,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
it
should
even
do
that,
i
mean,
if
our
ordinary
understanding
of
the
corporate
structure
and
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations
is
that
we
recognize
the
corporate
separate
entities,
and
we
recognize
that
a
parent
can
have
a
subsidiary
and
that
a
parent
isn't
liable
for
what
the
subsidiary
does
in
normal
circumstances.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
helpful,
and
i
don't
think
the
district
court
did
that.
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
district
court
focused
on
the
relation
of
the
parent
to
the
subsidiary,
and
a
corporate
veil-piercing
type
of
analysis,
and
certainly
the
sixth
circuit
did.
unknown
speaker
ms.
schiffer,
is
that
so?
i
mean,
he
did
discuss
financial
control
and
he
discussed
many
things
that
gave
me
the
impression
the
distinction
between
the
parent
controlling
the
subsidiary
and
the
parent
controlling
the
facility
of
the
subsidiary
is
a
distinction
much
easier
said
than
applied
in
fact,
because
much
of
what
the
district
judge
said,
it
seemed
to
me,
could
be
fit
under
the
category,
this
parent
is
controlling
the
subsidiary.
unknown
speaker
he
was
an
ott
board
member
though,
wasn't
he?
unknown
speaker
okay.
i'm...
i--
--may
i
ask
if
the
case
would
be
different
if
mr.
williams,
in
addition
to
his
responsibilities
for
the
parent,
had
also
been
on
the
board
of
directors
of
the
subsidiary
and
on
the
payroll
of
the
subsidiary
and
an
officer
of
the
subsidiary?
unknown
speaker
but
you
suggested
at
the
outset
that
there's
a
distinction
between
controlling
the
subsidiary
and
directly
controlling
the
facility,
and
if
everything
that
they
did
to
control
the
facility
was
done
by
directing
an
officer
to
do
what
he
thought
was
appropriate,
then
the
officer
went
ahead
and
ran
the
facility,
would
that
meet
your
test
or
not?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
other
individuals
in
williams'
position
who
had
no
position,
nominal
or
otherwise,
either
on
the
board
or
in
the
management
of
the
subsidiary,
but
who
were
nonetheless
directing
the
subsidiary's
own
offices
and
employees?
unknown
speaker
but
were
the
ones
who
were
not
so
related
independently
and
directingly...
directly
giving
orders
to
the
subsidiary?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
not
quite
on
the
same
plane
with
williams.
anyone
else
like
williams?
unknown
speaker
well--
--what
does
not
that
mean?
what
does
that
mean,
to
be
acting
in
your
cpc
capacity,
when
you
are
both
an
officer
of
cpc
and
an
officer
of
the
subsidiary
of
cpc?
is
there
any
difference
between
the
two?
the
interest
of
cpc
and
the
interests
of
the
subsidiary
are
identical.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
unless
we
get
a
situation
like
williams,
how
do
we
avoid
the
problem
that
justice
ginsburg
said
that
she
had
in
reading
the
findings?
how
do
we
draw
some
metaphysical
line
between
cpc
as
the
operator
and
cpc
simply
getting
the
benefit
of
the
influence
which
it
undoubtedly
has
as
a
parent
through
the
ownership
of
stock
and
through
the
frequently
overlapping
composition
of
the
officers
and
directors?
how
do
we
draw
that
line
when
we
don't
have
kind
of
an
easy
williams
example?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
i
don't
see
that
it
gives
me
a
basis.
it
seems
to
me
that
what
it
gives
me
is
a
conclusion.
to
say
that
cpc
is
doing
it,
that
cpc
is
operating,
when
all
i
can
tell
beyond
that
conclusion
is
that
their...
that
cpc
owns
the
stock,
that
there
are
some
directors
who
sit
on
each
of
the
two
boards,
that
there
may
be
some
officers
or
some
individuals
who
are
officers
of
each
of
the
two
corporations,
that
leaves
me
saying,
what
is
peculiar
about
cpc's
operation
which
differentiates
it
from
the
position
of
any
parent
of
any
operating
subsidiary,
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
now
do
we
know
they
have
their
cpc
hat
on
by
virtue
of
some
unusual
resolution
of
the
cpc
board
that
they
were
executing?
for
example,
do
we
have
any
resolutions
from
the
cpc
board
getting
down
into
the
minutiae
of
operating
the
subsidiary
to
a
degree
that
a
parent
normally
would
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
we
have
any
of
the
sort
that
i
just
asked
you
about?
unknown
speaker
ms
schiffer--
--may
i--
--may
i
ask
you,
in
view
of...
this
question
has
been
brewing
for
some
time,
and
there
are
diverse
statutes
where
congress
does
provide
for
reaching
a
parent...
sometimes
80
percent
test...
has
there
been
in
all
this
time
any
proposal,
any
direct
confrontation
by
the
legislature
of
this
question
of
parent
liability
for
the
subsidiary's
conduct?
unknown
speaker
what
is
magic
about
the
word
manage?
i
mean,
if
you
say
that
there's
some
special
participation
test
when
the
word
manage
is
used,
why
wouldn't
you
use
the
same
test
if
it
were
a
statute
that
used
the
word
use?
why
couldn't
you
say
just
as
easily
that
the
parent
uses
the
facility
or
uses
some...
or
any
verb?
i
don't
know
what
there
is
distinctive
about
the
verb
manage,
so
that
we're
going
to
have
a
special
test
for
this
statute.
i
worry
that
whatever
test
we
apply
to
this
statute
ought
to
be
applied
to
any
statute.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
i
used
the
wrong
word.
it's
operate,
which
you
say
is...
includes
management,
but
what's
magic
about
the
word
operate?
unknown
speaker
but
we
normally
think
that
when
a
subsidiary
is
operating
something
the
parent
is
not
operating
it,
unless,
you
know,
there's
veil-piercing.
now,
you
say
that
because
the
word...
the
word
operate
is
used
here,
that
there's
some
special...
we're
not
supposed
to
treat
it
like
an
ordinary
corporate
situation.
i
don't
see
what
that
verb...
why
that
verb
has
that
special
meaning.
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
with
a...
but
in
doing
that
you
look
at
specifically
what
mr.
arnold
ott
did
and
james
eiszner
and
some
of
these
others,
and
you
have
to
sort
of
say
what
hat
were
they
wearing
at
the
time
they
did
it.
does
the
record
tell
us
who
paid
their
salaries
when
they
were
doing
these
things?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
if
there's
evidence
in
the
record
on
that
point?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
the
district
court
doesn't
tell
us
who
paid
their
salaries.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
would
be
relevant?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing...
and
with
regard
to
mr.
williams'
case
i
guess
is
your
strongest
case,
supposing
the
record
showed
that
whenever
he
went
down...
went
over
to
muskegon
or
wherever
he
went
to
look
at
the
facility
and
participate,
he
was
especially
put
on
the
payroll
of
the
subsidiary
for
that
period
of
time,
and
paid
by
the
subsidiary
for
the
work
he
did,
would
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
we
don't
know
whether
that
happened.
unknown
speaker
ms.
schiffer,
is
it
the
government's
view
that
if
its
view
of
the
law
is
accepted
this
court
could
simply
order
the
district
court
judgment
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
that
really
doesn't
answer
my
question
at
all.
i
asked
you,
is
it
the
view
of
the
government
that
if
we
accept
your
view
of
the
law,
that
we
could
order
that
the
district
court's
judgment
be
affirmed?
unknown
speaker
is
it...
suppose...
i
don't...
i'm
having
trouble
with
the...
you've
said
two
separate
things.
one
is,
just
look
at
the
relation
of
the
parent
to
the
dump,
and
the
other
thing
was
that
the
parent
would
have
to
take
some
action
not
normal
to
the
parent's
subsidiary
relation.
i'm
trying
to
sort
those
out.
suppose
that
mr.
and
mrs.
smith
and
their
son,
john,
run
a
toxic
waste
dump,
and
they
have
a
company
called
the
smith
family
limited
liability
corporation.
they
do
everything
themselves.
nobody
else
does
a
thing.
they
operate
it.
they're
not
personally
liable,
are
they?
unknown
speaker
look,
i
said
mr.
and
mrs.
smith
and
their
son,
john,
do
everything.
they
have
a
shovel.
they
put
the
dirt
in.
they
do
everything
themselves.
they
are
doing
it
through...
they
are
paid...
the
checks
are
made
out
to
the
smith
family
limited
liability
corporation.
now,
i
would
think
that
that
is
the
classic
situation
of
where
a
group
of
people
form
a
corporation
to
limit
their
liability.
that's
why
we
have
corporations.
is
there
any
suggestion
in
what
you
say
that
the
smith
family
is
personally
liable?
nothing
special's
going
on.
it's
ordinary.
unknown
speaker
isn't
the
next
case
exactly
that?
wasn't
there
already
a
case
by
this
same...
of
a
sole
shareholder
corporation?
unknown
speaker
so
your
view
is
that
if
a
group
of
people
incorporate
themselves
and
they
personally
operate
the
dump,
they
are
personally
liable,
so
in
this
statute
alone...
i've
never
seen
another
statute
like
that...
there
is
no
way
for
a
group
of
operators
to
form
a
corporation
and
thereby
exempt
themselves
from
personal
liability.
i
mean,
is...
that's
the
view
of
the
government?
because
i
would
have
thought
that
if
that's
the
view
you
would
have
expected
congress
to
say
something
about
that
rather
unusual...
i
think
it
would
be
unusual.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
other
statute,
of
which
you
are
aware,
where
it
imposes
liability
is
imposed
on
some
entity...
call
it
person,
individual,
whatever...
and
without
saying
it
explicitly,
the
liability
flows
to
individual
shareholders,
it
flows
to
directors,
it
flows
to
the
corporate
form
makes
no
difference,
doesn't
limit
liability?
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
schiffer,
your
position
on
behalf
of
the
government
does
propose
a
very
fuzzy
sort
of
line
here
to
do
something
that
is
quite
contrary
to
normal
investment-backed
expectations,
and
which
may
not
be
clearly
mandated
by
the
language
of
the
statute.
and
maybe
because
of
that
the
sixth
circuit,
whose
judgment
we're
reviewing,
said,
we
give
up.
we're
going
to
apply
normal
state
veil-piercing
doctrine,
and
unless
the
veil
is
pierced
so
the
corporation
is
a
sham,
we're
going
to
protect
the
corporate
entity.
i
guess
that's
what
happened.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that's
what
you're
saying,
but
it
gets
us
back
to
that
same
question
of
how
you
draw
the
line
and
whether
the
statute
is,
indeed,
that
clear.
unknown
speaker
and
under
that
definition,
and
under
what
i
think
is
your
answer
to
justice
breyer,
and
i
want
to
be
very
clear
about
this,
it
would
be
very
rare
that
a
corporation
would
be
solely
liable
and
not
have
some
of
its
principal
managers,
operators,
officers,
also
liable,
is
that
not
right?
unknown
speaker
no,
forget
parent
and
subsidiary.
it's
very
unusual
for
a
corporation
to
commit
a
tort
by
itself
without
some
human
actor.
unknown
speaker
and
the
human
actor
is
a
cotortfeasor,
and
i
take
it
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
was
that
by
using
the
word,
any
person,
in
9607(b),
that
the
congress
would
make
all
of
the
people
in
his
hypothetical
that
were
actively
participating
in
the
waste
disposal
personally
liable.
unknown
speaker
and
even
if
they
hire
somebody?
i
mean,
let's
say
the
largest
corporation
in
the
world
decided
to
operate
toxic
waste
dumps,
hires
four
people
from
the
assembly
line
at
a
company
and
says,
you
go
out
and
you
pull
the
switches,
and
what
they
do
is,
they
pay
them
42
an
hour
or
something,
and
they
go
out
there
and
pull
switches,
and
those
people,
those
individuals,
those
workers
they
just
hired,
assuming
that
they,
you
know,
turn
the
shovels
and
so
forth,
in
your
view,
they're
liable,
too?
unknown
speaker
oh,
well,
why
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
what
they
do
is...
yes,
they--
unknown
speaker
--it
says
owner
or
operator.
certainly
justice
breyer's
people
are
operating
the
thing.
i'm
trying
to
assume
facts
that
they
are,
you
know.
i'm
trying
to
assume
facts
such
that
these
are
the
people...
they're
fairly
low-level
supervisors,
and
so
forth,
but
it's
a
small
dump,
and
what
they
do
is,
they
turn
shovels,
they
make
all
the
decisions
there,
they
decide
what
to
bury,
what
not
to
bury,
they
dig...
you
understand
what
i'm
driving
at.
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying,
in
the
government's
view,
is
that
kind
of
person
who's,
let's
say,
a
fourth
tier
employee
of
the
big
corporation,
also
personally
liable?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question,
though,
before
you
sit
down?
i
take
it
that
you
could
maintain
your
position
in
this
case
simply
by
saying,
i
will...
the
government
assumes
that
congress
meant
to
respect
corporate
forms,
that
congress
did
not
mean
to
look
behind
every
corporate
structure
whenever
an
employee
of
the
corporation
performs
a
duty,
and
still
maintain
your
position.
for
example,
what
i'm
thinking
of
is,
if
cpc
passed
a
resolution,
or
if
its
president
said
to
williams,
consistently
with
the
corporate
resolution,
williams,
go
down
there
and
make
sure
that
they
dump
the
waste
in
the
sand
immediately,
you
don't
have
to
say
that
williams
is
liable
under
those
circumstances
in
order
to
get
cpc
liability
as
well
as
the
subsidiary
liability,
do
you?
you
could
respect
the
corporate
form
and
still,
in
effect,
get
your...
the
result
that
you
think
is
proper
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
right,
but
i
thought
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
you
were
getting
to
the
point
where...
of
saying
that
whenever
the
employee
of
a
corporation
does
the
act
which
forms
a
part
of
the
operation,
that
the
employee
is
an
operator
and
therefore
liable
regardless
of
whether
the
employee
is
acting
as
a
maverick
in
relation
to
his
corporate
organization
or
whether
he
is
doing
exactly
what
his
corporate
organization
told
him
to
do,
and
now
i
think
you're
saying
you're
maybe
not
going
that
far.
unknown
speaker
so--
--so
i
think
that
you
were
saying
that
in
any
close
corporation
there
would
be
shareholder
liability.
unknown
speaker
i'm
referring
to
a
family
corporation,
the
kind
justice
breyer
described,
a
one-person
corporation,
a
closed
corporation,
very
small
group,
where
they're
all
involved
in
running
the
business.
in
all
those
cases
your
theory
is,
you
would
reach
the
people
who
are
operating,
the
participants
in
those
close
corporations.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
schiffer.
mr.
geller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
the
government
told
us
very
clearly
that
that
is
not
the
way
it
would
have
it.
it
says
the
parent
must
operate
the
facility,
not
the
sub.
unknown
speaker
and
then
i
asked,
well,
how
do
we--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
think
the
district
court's
findings
have
that
same
flaw.
unknown
speaker
however...
however,
in
determining
what
the
test
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
this
corporation,
whether
it's
a
parent,
whether
it's
a
partner,
where
it's
just
as
a
lease,
is
simply
a
co-tortfeasor
in
the
management
of
the
company.
it
seems
to
me
the
facts
of
the
record
could
support
that--
unknown
speaker
--could
support
that
test
if
we
send
it
back.
i
think
we'd
probably
have
to
remand.
unknown
speaker
granted.
unknown
speaker
and
if
we
can
just
stick
with
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
a
minute,
because
that's
where
we
ended
the
argument--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
agree
that
if
three
people
were
all
actively
involved
in
managing
a
facility,
that
they
would
all
be
operators?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
the
shareholders?
you
would--
unknown
speaker
--as
officers
of
their
corporation?
unknown
speaker
let
me
be
sure
i
understand
your
position,
mr.
geller.
you
take
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
and
say
yes,
mr.
and
mrs.
smith
and
their
son
would
be
liable,
if
i
understand
your--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
any
employee
of
a
corporation
with
a
facility
can
be
liable?
unknown
speaker
if
i
go
to
work
for
40
a
week
and
they
tell
me
to
dump
the
waste
in
the
sand,
i
am
liable
under
the
statute?
do
you
concede
that?
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
corporate--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
not
operating
it
on
my
own
behalf.
i'm
operating
it
as
an
agent
of
someone
else.
unknown
speaker
does
it
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
relevant?
i
mean,
they
can
sue
both
of
us.
they
can
sue
my
superior
and...
you
know,
the
company
and--
unknown
speaker
--but
what
about
williams?
that
seems
to
be
the
toughest
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
did
williams
do
in
particular?
i'm
concerned
in
particular.
unknown
speaker
even
if
we
eliminate
all
the
rest,
should
we
send
it
back
to
the
district
court--
unknown
speaker
--and
tell
the
district
court,
you
know,
is...
was
williams,
what
williams
did
enough?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
before
we
get
off
mr.
williams,
what
you
said
is,
well,
he
was
just
sort
of
a
peripheral
character,
but
at
least
one
of
these
briefs
told
us
that
the
sub
didn't
even
fill
out
a
questionnaire
without
consulting
him,
because
he
was
responsible
for
the
environmental
affairs
of
the
corporate
unit,
that
is,
both
parent
and
sub.
unknown
speaker
well,
where
did
williams
live?
i'd
like
to
get
something
concrete
here.
unknown
speaker
did
he
live
in
muskegon?
unknown
speaker
where
did
they
live?
unknown
speaker
even
mr.
ott?
was
mr
ott--
unknown
speaker
--it
would
be
better
for
your
case
if
the
dual
employees
lived
in
muskegon.
what's
better
for
your
case
is
if
the
sole
employee,
such
as
williams,
lived
in
new
jersey.
that
helps
you.
but
the
fact
that
the
dual
employees
were
at
cpc's
headquarters--
unknown
speaker
--but
do
you
agree
the
record
doesn't
tell
us
who
paid
their
salary
when
they
were
working?
supposing
they
were
paid
entirely
by
the
parent
for
everything
they
did,
would
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
he'd
be
acting
in
his
capacity
as
an
ott
ii
employee
if
all
his
money
came
from
the
parent?
unknown
speaker
strange.
unknown
speaker
well,
no,
they
just
say
you've
got
to
attribute
some
of
it
to
the
parent.
if
you
attribute
some
of
it
to
the
parent,
it's...
you
know,
maybe
half-time
he's
an
operator
and
half-time
he's
the
general--
unknown
speaker
--well,
the
district
court
did
emphasize
that
a
lot,
i
agree
with
you,
but
i'm
not
sure
they
confined
it
to
the
corporate
control.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
may
i
ask
for
a
clarification
before
you
do
that,
and
that...
you
said
the
sixth
circuit
took
care
of
williams.
they
made
him
a
minor
player
and
that's
that.
but
i
took
it
that
the
big
difference
between
the
district
court
and
the
sixth
circuit
was,
what
is
the
source
of
law
that
we
look
to,
because
if
it's
state
law
veil-piercing,
then
it
takes
a
sham,
a
fraud
to
go
through,
but
if
you...
on
the
district
judge's
view
and
on
the
government's
view
it's
not
state
law,
it's
federal
common
law.
they
called
it,
what,
a
middle
ground
or
something,
but
not
the
traditional
state
veil-piercing.
some
uniform
federal
notion
that
the
federal
courts
will
develop
of
a
parent
liability.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
government...
the
government
says
that's
not
its
theory
now,
at
least.
the
government
says
you
have
to
define
the
term
operate,
owner
and
operate.
these
people
were
actively
engaged
in
management
and
participating.
therefore,
they're
operators.
now,
maybe
that's
right,
maybe
that's
wrong,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
the
test
the
government
suggests
is
correct.
unknown
speaker
the
word
she
used
there
was
not
normal.
she
said...
ms.
schiffer
said,
well,
look
at
this,
and
if
you
see
something
happening
here
in
respect
to
operation
that
is
not
normally
present
where
you
have
a
simple
parent-subsidiary
relationship...
let's
say
the
parent
is
significantly
more
active
in
operating
than
a
company
that
was
the
classic
parent
subsidiary
relationship.
where
that
occurs,
then
you
could
say,
without
getting
into
all
the
problems
you're
talking
about,
that
the
parent
has
operated
it,
and
then
you
look
at
the
record
here
and
they
seem
to
have
some
things
that
would
go
beyond
what
would
be
normal.
that's
what
i
took
partly,
that...
i
heard
her
say
the
word
normal,
and
i've
extrapolated
on
that
a
little.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say
that
dual
officers,
people
who
are
officers
in
both
parent
and
subsidiary
corporation,
is
not
a
relevant
fact
at
all
to
be
considered?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
say,
mr.
geller,
that
it's
only
if
you
can
pierce
the
veil
that
you
can
impose
liability
on
the
parent?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
cpc
sends
a
memo
to
the
people
at
ott
and
says,
look,
we
know
the
pollution
inspectors
are
coming
around
on
friday,
so
dump
this
stuff
on
saturday,
not
thursday,
and
nobody
ever
goes
to
muskegon
to
do
it
themselves.
they
simply
send
that
memo
to
the
subsidiary.
unknown
speaker
but
that
wouldn't
matter
in
your
view,
anyway.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question,
mr.
geller,
before
i
forget
it?
there
is
the
special
provisions
about
lender
liability.
unknown
speaker
where...
which
are
a
departure
from
normal
rules.
if
the
parent's
participation
fit
into
the
fact
pattern
that
would
have
made
a
lender
liable,
would
the
parent
then
be
liable
as
an
operator?
unknown
speaker
so
that
what
your...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
position.
so
it
is...
a
lender
has
a
greater
exposure
than
a
parent.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand
that,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
want
to
be
sure
that
i
get
in
my...
sort
it
out
for
myself.
unknown
speaker
the
facts
that
would
make
a
lender
liable,
in
your
view,
would
not
be
sufficient
to
make
a
parent
liable.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i
thought
the
object
of
the
particular
lender
provision
was
directed
at
owning
rather
than
operating.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
what
the
statute
says.
the
statute,
which
is
at
2a
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
middle
of
the
page,
says
the
term
owner
or
operator
does
not
include
a
person
that
is
a
lender
that
did
not
participate--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
management
of
a
vessel.
unknown
speaker
whereabouts
on
2a
are
you
reading?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
such
term
is
owner
or
operator.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
seems
to
me,
as
justice
stevens
indicates,
that
if
management
participation,
which
is
what
the
congress
is
interested
in,
is
management
participation,
who's
doing
this,
if
that
suffices
to
hold
a
lender
liable,
surely
it
should
hold
a
corporate...
an
affiliated
corporation
liable.
unknown
speaker
i
agree.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
we're
talking
about
the
test.
unknown
speaker
if
a
parent
participated
in
management,
as
defined
in
this
section
that
is
applicable
to
lenders,
would
that
parent,
by
reason
of
that
participation
in
management,
be
an
operator?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
geller,
on
2a,
sub...
(e)(i),
it's
exclusions
of
lenders
not
participant
in
management,
(i)
indicia
of
ownership
to
protect
security,
the
term
owner
or
operator
does
not
include
a
person
that
is
a
lender
without...
blah,
blah,
blah.
unknown
speaker
right.
regardless...
if...
but
in
any
event,
do
you
think
that
if
a
lender,
say
the
chase
bank,
or
some
large
lending
institution,
did
exactly
what
the
parent
did
in
this
case,
sent
williams
out
to
tell
them
not
to
open
that
one
facility
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
do
you
think
they
would
be
liable
as
a
lender
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
your
submission
is
that
even
if
they
might,
the
parent
would
not?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
lender
would
be
under
the--
unknown
speaker
--it
would
be
a
meaningless
exception
to
the
exemption--
unknown
speaker
--if
participating
in
management
were
the
same
as
operating--
unknown
speaker
--because
then
you
wouldn't
have
to
get
them
as
an
owner.
unknown
speaker
you
could
get
them
as
an
operator.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
need
it.
it
wouldn't
do
you
any
good.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
geller,
the
government
told
us
that
that
was
meant
to
deal
with
facilities
that
had
long
ceased
operating,
that
that
was
otherwise
controlled.
you
stopped
any
operations
at
the
place
but
you
have
security
guards
or
whatever
you
have.
that
was
the
picture
that
i
got.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
could
i
call
you
back
to
mr.
williams
again
and
ask
you
to
address
the
findings
of
the
district
court
concerning
williams?
they're
set
forth
on
75a
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
the...
the
district
court
finds
that
he
exerted
control
over
a
variety
of
ott
ii
environmental
matters.
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from?
75a
in
the
middle
of
the
page.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
goes
on
to
give
what
i
take
are...
its...
what
it
believed
constituted
exerting
control.
in
a
meeting
with
the
water
resources
commission,
williams
participated
in
discussions
which,
as
a
result
of
his
influence,
did
not
include
presentation
by
ott
ii.
i
guess
influence
wouldn't
be
the
same
as
directing,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
next
one?
unknown
speaker
operating...
but
the
next
one
said,
he
instructed
them
regarding
various
responses
to
state
and
federal--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
that's
not
operating?
unknown
speaker
if
we
have
a
4,000-page
record
on
this,
is
it
perhaps...
if
they've
made
the
findings
not
supported,
we
should
send
it
back
under
a
correct
standard,
and
is
that
correct--
unknown
speaker
--standard,
in
your
view,
the
standard
that
if
a
parent
operates
simply
as
a
shareholder...
a
shareholder,
which
includes
appointing
directors
and
doing
those
things
that
100-percent
shareholders
often
do,
that
that
is
not
sufficient
for
liability,
but
if
it
goes
beyond
what
shareholders
normally
do
in
the
direction
of
making
operational
decisions,
then
it
is
liable,
so
we
would
look
to
what
is
normal
in
a
relationship
between
parent
and
sub,
a
100-percent
shareholder.
i
mean,
i'm
looking
for
a
way
of
stating
the
correct
standard.
the
sixth
circuit
itself
thought
that
a
parent
could
go
beyond
what
is
normal--
unknown
speaker
--it
said
about
joint
venture,
but
i
mean,
that--
unknown
speaker
--doesn't
really
capture
it
very
well.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
then
we
use
the
word...
is
the
word...
is--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
looking
for
the
best
way
to
state
what
i
think
you
might
agree
and
everyone
might
agree
that
it's
certainly
possible
for
a
parent
to
go
out
and
begin
to
operate
the
facility
irrespective
of
whether
the
subsidiary
does
as
well.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
what's
the
word...
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
about
making
managerial
decisions
that
determine
how
those
operations
will
take
place?
unknown
speaker
why
all?
unknown
speaker
how
about
actually
participated
in
the
management
or
operational
affairs
of
the
facility?
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
let
me
just...
i
don't
mean
to
be
beating
a
dead
horse
here,
but
i
do
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
completely
your
thought
on
this.
supposing
we
went
through
this
series
of
reasoning
and
said,
we've
got
to
decide
what
an
operator
is.
you
might
say
an
operator
is
a
person
who
participates
actively
in
management.
that
might
be
a
test.
and
then
you'd
say,
well,
what
does
participate
in
management
mean?
what
would
be
wrong
with
saying,
we
look
at
the
definition
of
participation
in
management
that
congress
provided
us
for
determining
when
lenders
become
owners
or
operators?
what
would
be
wrong
with
that
approach?
unknown
speaker
it
just
occurred
to
me,
and
i
should
have
thought
of
it
before,
but--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
don't...
you
think
participating
in
management
is
not--
unknown
speaker
--enough
to
be
an
operator?
unknown
speaker
would
not...
i'm
not
suggesting
you're
giving
that
away.
