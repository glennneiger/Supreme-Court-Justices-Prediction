mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
under
cercla,
a
past
or
present
owner
or
operator
of
a
hazardous
waste
facility
is
liable
for
cleanup
costs
paid
by
the
government.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
a
parent
corporation
becomes
an
operator
under
cercla
simply
by
participating
in
and
exerting
some
unspecified
degree
of
control
over
the
affairs
of
a
subsidiary
that
operates
such
a
facility.
the
answer
to
that
question,
in
our
view,
turns
entirely
on
whether
congress
meant
to
sweep
away
traditional
common
law
principles
of
limited
shareholder
liability
merely
by
using
the
word
operator
in
cercla.
we
believe
that
the
government's
theory
of
parent
company
liability
is
unsupportable
for
a
number
of
reasons.
the
most
obvious
reason
is
that
is
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
cercla
imposes
liability
on
persons
that
operate
a
facility.
that
is,
a
place
where
hazardous
substances
are
deposited.
it
doesn't
impose
liability,
as
the
government
would
have
it,
on
persons
that
control
separate
entities
that
in
turn
operate
that
facility.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
justice
ginsburg,
there's
a
lot
of
historical
revisionism
going
on
here
today.
the
government's
position
from
the
moment
this
case
was
brought
was
that
all
it
had
to
show
was
that
cpc
controlled
the
affairs
of
its
subsidiary.
it
never
took
the
position
that
it
had
to
prove
that
cpc
actually
operated
the
muskegon
facility
based
on--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--they
absolutely
do,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
so.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
believe
it
could,
justice
kennedy.
corporations
can
only
act
through
their
employees,
obviously.
in
order
to
show
that
cpc
operated
this
facility,
you
have
to
show
that
some
employee
of
cpc
did
something
that
could
be
construed
as
operating
this
facility.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
now--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
but
the
point
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
the
shareholders
were
actually
operating
the
facility.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
no,
if
they
were
actually
personally
involved
in
operating,
they
may
well
be
operators.
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
simply
have
a
shareholder
here
that
did
nothing
that
could
be
construed
as
operating
the
facility.
all
of
the
employees
of
cpc--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
they
were
actually
physically
engaged
in
operating
the
facility,
they
would
fall
within
the
statute,
i
would
think,
but
that's
not--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
someone
satisfies
the
definition
of
operator,
they're
liable
under
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--technically
if
you're
a
person,
if
you're
operating
the
facility
you
would
be
liable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
there
may
well
be...
you
know,
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--and
under--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--respondeat
superior
principles
the
corporation
would
be
liable
as
well
and
this
issue
we're
debating
now
would
not
be
relevant.
but
i
want
to
make...
bring
us
back
to
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's...
that's...
we're
not
here
to
argue
that
the
employee
would
be
liable
in
that
situation.
you'd
have
to
know
the
facts
of
that
case.
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
no
cpc
employee
did
anything
that
could
be
construed
as
operating
this
facility.
all
of
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--williams
is
the
only
person
that
they
have
identified
as
an
employee
of
cpc
and
nothing
that
williams
did
can
be
construed
as
operating
this
facility.
he
attended
a
single
meeting.
he
gave
some
advice
which
was
not
followed.
that
was
the
extent
of
williams'
involvement
in
this
case.
when
you
look
at
the
list
of
factors
that
the
district
court
identified
as
to
why
it
concluded
that
cpc
was
an
operator
here,
williams
is
far
down
the
list.
what
the
district
court
principally
referred
to
was
the
fact
that
cpc
owned
100
percent
of
the
stock
here.
there
were
some
dual
officers
and
directors.
the
fact
is,
there
is
no
employee
of
cpc
that
did
anything
here
that
could
be
construed
as
operating
the
facility.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
he--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no,
i--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
the...
justice
scalia,
if
the
sixth
circuit
adopted
the
right
legal
standard,
which
we
conclude
it
did,
there's
no
reason
to
send
it
back
because
the
sixth
circuit
looked
at
all
the
evidence
in
this
case,
including
williams,
and
concluded
that
none
of
that
amounted
to
operating
a
facility
on
the
part
of
cpc.
but
i'd
like
to
return
the
court,
if
it
would,
because
there's
a
lot...
been
a
lot
of--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--justice
ginsburg,
that
is
completely
untrue.
williams
was
a
lawyer-lobbyist
who
worked
for
cpc
who
attended
a
single
meeting,
would
occasionally
give
advice
to
ott
ii,
which
was
frequently
ignored.
but
as
i
say,
all
of
this
was
before
the
sixth
circuit,
which
concluded
that
none
of
this
amounted
to
direct
operation
of
the
facility
by
cpc.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
williams
lived--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no.
no,
he
didn't.
none
of
the...
none
of
the
c...
none
of
the
people
whose
activities
here
were
attributable
to
cpc,
none
of
the
dual
employees
lived
at
the
muskegon
site.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
all
lived
in
new
jersey,
where
cpc
had
its
corporate
headquarters.
none
of
them
was--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--mr.
ott...
the
two
corporate
officers
who
had
dual...
who
wore
the
two
hats,
ott
and
eiszner,
who
had
been
employees
of
ott
i
when
it
was
taken
over
by
cpc,
shared
their
time
between
muskegon
and
new
jersey,
spent
most
of
their
time
at
cpc--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it
doesn't
matter
where
they
lived.
the
question
is,
when
these
dual
employees
took
actions
on
behalf
of
ott
ii,
is
it
appropriate
to
attribute
those
actions
to
the
parent
cpc,
and
the
common
law
rule
is
clearly
no.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
they
were
employee...
if
they
were
acting...
if
they
were
dual
employees,
it
seems
to
me,
justice
stevens,
it
doesn't
matter
who
paid
their
salaries.
the
question
is,
in
what
capacity
were
they
acting,
and
if
they
were
acting
in
their
capacity
as
ott
ii
employees
it
is
inappropriate...
inappropriate--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
the
record
doesn't
reflect,
of
course,
and
it's--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--silly
to
speculate.
the
question
is,
who
is
responsible
for
the
activities
of
these
dual
employees,
and
the
common
law
answers
that
question
quite
clearly.
what
the
government
is
asking
for
here
is
a
new
federal
common
law
rule
to
attribute
all
of
that
activity
to
the
parent,
and
there's
absolutely
no
basis--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
government
has
never
made
that
case.
what
they
suggest
is
simply
because
cpc
controlled
and
participated
in
the
activities
of
its--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--well,
i
would
like
if
i
could
to
turn
the
court's
attention
to
the
district
court's
fact-findings,
because
it
seems
to
me
they
are
fairly
significant
in
this
case,
and
quite
contrary
to
what
the
government
suggests
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
the
district
court
adopted
this
new
middle
ground
of
liability,
which
is
something
in
between
direct
liability
and
state
common
law
veil-piercing,
and
the
question
in
this
case,
the
question
for
this
court
is,
is
there
anything
in
cercla
that
could
be
read
on
the
part
of
congress
to
want
to
have
a
new
rule
for
attributing
the
liability
of
the
subsidiary
to
the
parent
where
the
congress--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
test
is
whether
the
parent
can
be
said
to
be
operating.
the
only
way
a
corporation
can
be
operating,
justice
kennedy,
is
through
its
employees,
and
therefore,
in
order
to
meet
the
government's
test
you
have
to
show
that
some
employee
of
cpc
did
anything
that
constitutes
operating
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
there
was
a...
if
i
could
just
finish
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
if
i
could,
you
have
to
find
that
some
employe
of
cpc
was
doing
something
here
that
could
be
considered
operating
before
you
could
conclude
that
cpc
itself...
there
was
no
evidence
here.
the
only
evidence
that
the
district
court
relied
on
was
the
dual
officers,
that
ott
and
eiszner
worked
both
for
cpc
and
for
ott
ii.
if
you...
now,
the
question
is,
how
can
you
attribute
what
ott
and
eiszner
did
in
their
role
as
ott
ii
employees
and
officers
to
cpc
in
a
way
that
makes
cpc
the
operator?
the
normal
common
law
rule
would
not
allow
you
to
do
that,
and
therefore
the
only
question
really
is,
did
congress,
in
enacting
cercla,
intend
to
have
a
different
attribution
rule?
is
there
any
evidence
in
the
statute
itself
that
congress
intended
to
eliminate
or
supplant
the
normal
common
law
rule
of
limited
shareholder
liability
and
create
some
amorphous,
undefined
test
that
suggests
that
if
the
parent
takes
an
active
role
in
controlling
its
subsidiary,
which
all
parents
of
wholly-owned
subsidiaries
do,
then
there's
going
to
be
liability
on
the
part
of
the
parent,
and
our
submission
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--under
the
common
law,
it
would
be
a
typical
situation
and
not
a
relevant
fact
to
consider
in
veil-piercing.
you'd
have
to
show
something
far
more
than
simply
that
they
were
dual
officers.
several
of
the
amicus
briefs
filed
in
this
court
have
cited
numerous
authorities
to
the
court,
including
this
court's
own
cases,
that
suggest
that
it's
the
typical
situation,
particularly
in
a
case
of
a
wholly-owned
subsidiary,
to
have
some
dual
officers,
and
in
fact
you
had
fewer
here
than
you
had
in
the
normal
case.
remember,
this
was
ott--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--we
agree
that
there
are
two
ways,
as
the
sixth
circuit
said,
to
show
that
the
parent
is
liable
under
cercla.
first,
if
the
parent
itself,
through
its
own
officers,
has
done
something
that
could
constitute
operating,
the
parent
is
liable.
if,
for
example,
at
this
facility
cpc
had
been
using
the
facility
as
part
of
its
foreign
business,
or
had
in
some
way
directed
the
disposal
of
the
hazardous
waste,
it
would
be
liable
as
an
operator.
secondly,
there's
vicarious
liability.
cpc
as
the
parent
could
be
liable
if
you
could
pierce
the
corporate
veil.
the
government--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if...
in
that
sort
of
situation,
if
you
have
direct
parental
involvement
in
something
that
might
constitute
operating
the
facility,
there
may
well
be
liability.
there
isn't
a
stitch
of
evidence
in
this
particular
case
that
any
sort
of...
any
of
that
sort
of
thing
happened.
remember,
ott
i
was
a
functioning
business
here
before
cpc
came
into
the
picture.
when
cpc
bought
ott
i
and
it
became
ott
ii,
basically
the
same
officers
were
left
in
place,
ott
and
eiszner.
ott
and
eiszner
were
then
given
additional
responsibilities
at
the
parent
cpc,
but
this
isn't
the
case
in
which
cpc
suddenly
took
over
and
implanted
its
own
officers
throughout
the
subsidiary's
corporate
structure.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
wouldn't
matter,
justice
scalia,
except
atmospherically.
this
is
hardly
a
case
of
an
atypical
parent-subsidiary
relationship.
in
fact,
the
evidence
here
suggests
more
of
a
hands-off
relationship
and
while
i'm
not
going
to
take
the
time
now
to
read
any
of
this,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
the
findings
of
the
district
court
at
pages
67
and
69a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
where
the
district
court
makes
thorough
findings
that
this
was
a
facility
that
was
completely
operated
by
ott
ii's
officers
and
management.
there
isn't
any
suggestion
that
any
employee
of
cpc
had
anything
to
do
with
the
management
of
this
facility.
it's
purely
a
vicarious
liability
theory
that
the
government
from
day
one
in
this
case
has
tried
to...
has
argued
for
in
order
to
impose
liability
on
cpc.
and
therefore
the
question
is,
did
congress
mean
to
impose
a
completely
different
rule
of
vicarious
liability
here
beyond
that
what
the
common
law
for
100
years
has
required
in
order
to
have
a
shareholder
be
liable
for
the
operations
of
this
corporation,
and
we
suggest
that
there
are
lots
of
indications
that
congress
never
had
that
intention
in
cercla.
to
begin
with,
this
court
has
many
times
said
that
in
order
for
congress
to
supplant
a
common
law
rule,
particularly
a
rule
as
ingrained
as
the--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
participating
in
the
management
facility
is
not
the
same
thing
as
operating
the
facility.
to
begin
with,
this
is--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--because
a
lender
is
already...
first
of
all,
not
every
lender
is
liable.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
only
a
lender
that
has
indicia--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
they
may
or
may
not.
the
lender...
the
lender
may
be
participating
in
the
management
of
a
facility
to
such
an
extent
that
it
has
become
an
operator,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--absolutely,
justice
souter.
that
was
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
with
justice
stevens.
it's
an
exception
to
owner
liability.
it
has
nothing
at
all
to
do--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes,
but--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--justice
kennedy,
if
you
look...
the
only
reason
this
is
in
here
is
because
if
you
look
at
the
bottom
of
that,
holds
indicia
of
ownership...
in
other
words--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i'm
on...
well,
actually,
i'm
on
la
of
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief,
where
the...
9601
is
reprinted,
and
(20)(a),
if
you
look
at
the
last
sentence
in
that
paragraph,
such
term
does
not
include,
if
you
see
that,
such
term
does
not
include
a
person
who
holds
indicia
of
ownership
primarily
to
protect
a
security
interest.
in
other
words,
these
are
people
who
would
have
been
considered
owners
because
they
had
indicia
of
ownership
primarily
to
protect
their
security
interest.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well,
that
may
be.
i'm
not
sure
it
changes
anything,
justice
kennedy.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
the
derivation
of
this,
this
came
into
a
house
bill,
h.r.
85,
that
only
defined
owner,
and
this
was
an
exception
to
owner
liability.
when
the
bills
were
combined
it
was
put
in
this
way,
but
it's
clear
that
what
congress
was
talking
about
here
are
people
who
hold
security
interests
in
states
that
would
make
them
owners.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
for
several
reasons
not
so,
justice
kennedy.
first
of
all,
it's
not
participation
in
the
management
of
a
subsidiary.
it's
participation
in
management
of
a
facility.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
and
i
don't...
cpc
would
not
satisfy
that
definition
here,
because
it
did
not
participate...
no
one
played--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
understand.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
would...
no.
they
would
not
be
liable
as
operators,
justice
kennedy.
they
would
not
satisfy
the
exemption
from
liability
as
owners.
that's
the
point.
this
is
an
exemption
from...
these
are
people
who
would
otherwise
be
liable
as
owners,
and
congress--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
understand
that,
justice
stevens,
but
it's
only
because
of
the
indicia
of
ownership
that
this
matters.
these
are
people
who
would
be
liable
as
owners.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
no.
not
so,
justice
stevens.
i
don't
think
they
would
satisfy
the
definition
of
who
are
participating
in
management
of
this
facility.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
the
parent
would
not
be
liable
in
that
situation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
yes,
because
this
is
a...
participating
in
the
management
is
not
the
same...
as
epa
has
conceded,
participating
in
the
management
is
not
the
same
thing
as
operating.
this
is
an
exemption
that
applies
to
owner
liability.
it
has
no
relevance
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
exactly
right,
justice
scalia.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
to
say
that
the
only
way
you
can
satisfy
the
exemption
from
owner
liability
is
to
show
that
you're
not
an
operator,
because
if
you
are
an
operator
you
wouldn't
need
the
exemption
from
owner...
you're
absolutely
right.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
it
wouldn't
do
you
any
good.
you'd
be
liable
in
exactly
the
same
way
under
cercla.
i
want
to
just
continue
this
point
that
there's
no
evidence
here
that
congress
mean
to
change
the
common
law
rule.
to
begin
with,
this
court
has
said
that
congress
will
not
be
taken
to
change
common
law
rules,
particularly
ones
as
ingrained
as
limited
liability
for
shareholders,
without
clear
evidence
that
it
intended
to
do
so.
there
is
absolutely
no
clear
evidence
here.
in
fact,
in
this
statute
there
is
another
provision
of
this
statute
in
which
congress
did
import
a
control
test.
when
you're
dealing
with
abandoned
facilities,
congress
provided
that
people
are
liable
not
only
if
they
owned
or
operated
the
facility,
but
also
if
they
otherwise
controlled
the
facility,
so
congress
clearly
knew
how
to
import
the
concept
of
control
when
it
wanted
to
do
so,
but
it
didn't
do
so
in
this
case.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
that's
what
they
say.
there's
certainly
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
or
anywhere
else
to
support
that,
but
even
if
that
were
true,
in
their
view
operating
includes
the
concept
of
control,
and
therefore
there
would
still
have
been
no
reason
for
congress
to
have
put
otherwise
controlled
in
there.
congress
could
have
said,
whoever
was
operating
the
facility
immediately
before
it
was
abandoned,
but
congress
didn't
do
that.
they
said,
owned,
operated,
or
controlled
the
facility
immediately
before
it
was
abandoned,
so
this
clearly
shows
that
operator
requires
something
different
than
mere
control.
in
addition,
as
you
said,
pointed
out,
justice
ginsburg,
there
are
many
other
statutes,
many
other
statutes,
including
important
statutes
like
erisa
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
the
securities
exchange
act,
where
congress
has
imposed
liability
on
people
who
control
violators.
in
other
words,
corporations
are
liable,
as
are
their
parents,
in
those
situations.
congress
specifically
did
not
do
that
in
this
particular
statute.
and
it
would
be
inappropriate,
we
think,
for
the
court
to
read
that
in
there
when
congress
has
not
chosen
to
put
it
in.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
is
no...
if
i
could
say,
justice
scalia,
there's
no
evidence
to
support
that
finding.
the
district
court
doesn't
cite
any
evidence.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
right.
in
fact,
i
think
all
these
fact-findings
are
not
supported
by
the
record,
but
even
if
they
were
taken
as
true,
and
i
would
refer
the
court
to
our
reply
brief
and
our
supplemental
brief
for
why
they're
not
true,
i
don't
think
that
would
rise
to
the
level--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--operating
this
facility,
operating--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--there
was
a...
they
were
negotiating--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--that's
not
operating
this
facility.
there
were
negotiations
going
on
at
the
time
with
the
michigan
water
resources
commission
as
to
use
of
the
water
facility,
the
county
water
facility,
and
williams
attended
one
of
a
dozen
of
those
meetings.
he
made
some
recommendations,
most
of
which
were
not
accepted.
this
is
all,
i
think,
in
our
reply
brief.
none
of
this,
even
if
true,
i
think
would
amount
to
operating
the
muskegon
facility,
which
is
what's
relevant
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--what
the
sixth
circuit
said
was
that
the...
that
the
parent--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--no.
what
was--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--this
is
at
17
and
18
of
the
joint...
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
justice
breyer.
what
the...
it
said
a
parent
could
be
liable
if
it
directly
operated
the
facility.
it
didn't
say...
have
anything
to
do
with--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--the
influence
that
the
parent
had
over
the
subsidiary,
which
is
what
you're
talking
about
now,
i
believe.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
if
employees--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
employees
of
the
parent
are
directly
involved
in
operating
the
facility,
in
other
words,
engaged
in
the
day-to-day
running
of
the
facility,
involved
in
the
dumping
of
the
hazardous
waste
of
the
facility--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
you
could
show
that
the
parent,
as
opposed
to
dual
officers,
which
is
what
we
have
in
this
case,
if
you
could
show
that
the
parent
was
making
all
of
the
decisions
for
the
subsidiary--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--or
decisions
related
to
the
facility--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--if
you
could
show
that
the
parent
was
actually
doing
that,
but
there's
no
evidence
the
parent
was
doing
that
in
this
case.
all
of
the
evidence
that
would
support
that
sort
of
a
conclusion
in
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
has
to
do
with
ott
and
eiszner,
who
were
dual
officers.
there
was
no...
i
say
this
again
because
it's
so
significant.
there
was
no
employee
of
cpc...
of
cpc,
as
opposed
to
these
dual
officers,
whose
actions
cannot
be
attributed
to
cpc.
there
was
no
employee
of
cpc
that
did
anything
in
this
case
that
could
be
construed
as
operating
this
facility.
that's
what
the
sixth
circuit
held.
we
think
the
sixth
circuit
adopted
the
correct
legal
standard,
and
we
think
that
it
reviewed
the
record
in
this
case
and
correctly
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
was
no
operator
liability.
now,
i
just
want
to
conclude
by
saying
that
although
the
government
tries
to
sugar-coat
its
position,
if
the
evidence
here
is
sufficient
to
find
the
parent
liable
under
a
federal
veil-piercing
theory,
and
it's
hard
to
imagine
any
parent
of
a
wholly
owned
subsidiary
that
wouldn't
be
liable
for
its
subsidiary's
acts
under
cercla
by
virtue
of
the
government's
two-step
theory,
it
would
be...
this
would
be
an
astounding
extension
of
cercla
liability.
parents
would
never
know
when
they
have
overstepped
what
the
government
thinks
is
an
appropriate
investor
relationship,
as
they
say,
and
instead
have
left
themselves
open
for
millions
of
dollars
of
unexpected
cercla
liability.
it's
an
amorphous
and
unworkable
test,
and
it's
contrary
to
the
common
law
test
that's
been
around
for
100
years.
there's
no
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
supplant
that
common
law
test
with
this
new
middle
ground
that
the
district
court
has
adopted
here.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
well--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--it...
i
think
it
would
be
wrong
because
it
equates
participating
in
management
with
operation.
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
i
think
it's
a
different--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--i
think
it's
a
different
test,
but
i
would
also
say
that
even
if
you
did
that,
what
cpc
did
in
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
s.
geller
--yes.
it's
a
diff...
congress
could
have
just
said
operates
instead
of
participating
in
management--
