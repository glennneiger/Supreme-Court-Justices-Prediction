mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
prosecution
was
entitled
to
use
codefendant
bell's
confession
to
prove
bell's
guilt
and
nothing
more.
bell's
confession
contained
two
admissions
that
completely
and
fairly
accomplished
this
purpose.
in
his
confession,
bell
admitted
both
hitting
and
beating
stacey
willams.
the
remaining
portion
of
bell's
confession,
which
focused
exclusively
on
establishing
the
role
of
and
the
identity
of
bell's
alleged
accomplices,
served
no
legitimate
purpose.
the
remaining
portions
of
bell's
confession
were
nothing
more
than
unreliable
hearsay.
the
remaining
portions
of
bell's
confession
should
not
have
been
admitted,
because
they
created
for
petitioner
a
totally
unnecessary
risk
of
prejudice
for
petitioner.
the
use
of
the
terms,
deleted
and
deletion
in
this
case
did
not,
in
the
words
of
the
trial
judge,
sanitize
bell's
confession.
the
words,
if
anything,
drew
the
jury's
attention
to
the
fact
that
a
name
had
been
omitted.
they
in
a
sense
acted
as
a
red
flag
to
the
jury.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
i
do
not
take
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
oh,
i
disagree.
it
could
have
been
redacted--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--i
disagree
that
it
could
have
been
redacted
to
allow
in
the
simple
statement
that
i
hit
and
i
struck
the
victim.
that
is
the
only
part--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--i
don't
believe
that
is
necessary,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
it
should
not
be--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--it
does
not
point
to
a
specific
person.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
what
it
does--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--in
this
case
it
would
not--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--in
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
it
would
not
have
been
extremely
prejudicial.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
but
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make
is,
that
evidence
served
no
legitimate
purpose.
since
it
served
no
legitimate
purpose,
it
should
not
have
been
admitted.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
that
several
other
witnesses
were...
several
other
persons
were
involved.
in
other
words,
there's
no
reason
that
bell's
confession
needed
to
include
that
information.
that
information
was
not
in
dispute
at
the
trial.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
justice
scalia,
my
position
would
have
to
be
that
it
is
unnecessary.
if
it
were
admitted
for...
solely
for
the
purpose
of
putting
the
statement
in
context--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--under
the
facts
of
this
case,
justice
ginsburg,
it
doesn't
make
a
difference.
if
the--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--it's
not
a
significant
difference,
no.
under
the
facts
of
this
case
i
believe
that
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
the
use
of
the
term,
deleted
and
deletion,
which
drew
the
attention--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--it
is
not.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
under
bruton
and
marsh
the
attention
seems
to
be
focused
towards
the
end
of
the
process
in
terms
of
using
a
limiting
instruction
to--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--there
is...
in
those
particular
cases
there
is
no
analysis
of
necessity,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
asking...
i'm
trying
to
put
it
in
a
context
that's...
that
would
show
that
although
in
this
case
it
may
not
be
necessary
for
the
resolution
of
this
case,
because
the
thrust
of
my
argument
is
the
use
of
the
term
deleted
and
deletion,
that
the
use
of
what
this...
the
respondent
refers
to
as
neutral
pronouns
is
very
misleading.
there
are...
for
example,
in
this
case
had
there
been
no
other
witnesses
and
we
were
simply
looking
at
bell's
statement,
and
bell
said
that
i
hit
the
victim,
but
he
beat
the
victim,
he
dropped
the
victim
on
his
head,
on
its
face
that
statement
is
neutral,
but
in
that
context
the
prosecution
is
unnecessarily
benefiting
from
a
statement
that
they
should
not
receive
any
benefit.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
it's
unnecessary
because
it
serves
really
no
legitimate
purpose.
it--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--as
i
understand...
the
reason
for
my
position
is
that
the
parts
that
are
properly
admitted
are
admitted
because
they
incriminate
the
maker
of
the
statement.
the
other
parts
of
the
statement
that
are...
serve
no
purpose
other
than
to
perhaps
put
the
statement
in
some
sort
of
a
context.
since
context
is
not
in
dispute
in
this
case,
they
seem
to
me
to
be
superfluous.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
only
a
limited--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--your
honor's
opinion
in
williamson
with
a
declaration
of
penal
interest
was
very
careful
to
limit
it
strictly
to
declarations
against
the
interest
of
the
party
making
the
statement.
to
the
extent
that
he
admitted,
i
hit
the
victim,
i
beat
the
victim,
it
is
a
declaration
against
interest.
beyond
that,
it
is
not
a
declaration
against
interest.
as
in
williamson,
i
believe
justice
ginsburg
in
her
concurring
opinion
was...
pointed
out
the
confusion
that
exists
where
a
declaration
of
interest
is
really
not
a
declaration
against
interest,
and
i
think
that's
what
we
have
in
this
situation.
we
only
have
a
very
small
portion
of
bell's
confession
that
actually
deals
with
his
involvement.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
that
is
correct.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
the
parts
that
are
incriminating
only
to
bell.
the
bulk
of
the
statement,
however,
is
focused
on
establishing
the
role
of
the
other
participants.
there
is
no
need
for
that
evidence.
it
allowed
that
evidence
to
be
used
for
one
purpose
and
one
purpose
only,
to
incriminate
petitioner.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
in...
my
position
is,
it
should
not
be
admitted
by
the
trial
judge.
if
it
is,
as
in
this
case,
admitted
by
the
trial
judge,
it
would
perhaps
be
harmless
error
in
light
of
the
other
evidence
presented
at
trial.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
the
admission
does,
in
my
opinion,
violate
the
confrontation
clause
because
it
incriminates
other
persons.
it
does
not
strictly
incriminate
the
person
who
made
the
statement.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
in--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
my
answer
is
that
the
substantial
risk
of
prejudice
arose
from
the
use
of
the
terms,
deleted
and
deletion.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
prejudice
to
the
petitioner.
the
use
of
the
terms
deleted
and
deletion.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
in
this
case,
i
think
common
experience,
there's
no
other
reason
for
the
use
of
the
term,
deleted,
other
than
to
point
to
the
other
defendant.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
well,
your
honor--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--the
common
experience,
i
think,
of
most
people
today
is
that
whenever
there's...
as
on
television,
there's
the
blip
that
censors
a
word.
immediately
you
focus
in
on
the
blip.
you
immediately
think,
what
was
omitted.
in
this
case...
in
that
case
there
may
be
five
or
six
possible
words
that
were
omitted,
but
in
this
case--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--this...
in
the
statement,
there
were
wited
out
spaces--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--and
then
comma,
wited
out
spaces
and
then
the
other
information.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
no,
i
do
not.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
i
do
not
want
to
have
the
court
left
with
the
impression
that
my
case
rises
or
falls
on
the
several
other
guys.
the
extreme
prejudice
in
this
case
comes
from
the
use,
deleted
and
deletion.
in
context,
several
other
guys
is
consistent
with
other
testimony
at
trial.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
marsh...
in
marsh
the...
from
the
reading
of
the
statement
itself
you
would
have
no
idea
of
the...
even
the
existence
of
another
person,
so
it
is
quite
different
from
this.
this
case
is
not
that
much
different
from
bruton
in
that
it...
the
word
deleted
is
not
that
much
different
from
the
use
of
a
person's
actual
name,
and
again
focusing
on
the
use
of
deleted
and
several
other
witnesses,
i
think
the
juxtaposition
of
those
terms
aggravates
the
situation,
because
had
it
been
redacted
to
just
say,
several
other
witnesses,
the
jury's
attention
would
not
have
been
drawn
to
the
fact
that
names
were
omitted.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
i
think
the
jury
would
be
left
with
no
other
conclusion
than
that
it
was
petitioner's
name
and
tank's
name.
now,
which
deleted
referred
to
petitioner
and
which
deleted
referred
to
tank
is
some...
a
matter
that
they
could
speculate
on.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
if...
it
calls
to
the
jury's
attention
that
a
name
has
been
removed.
in
the
context
of
this
trial,
there's
no
need
to
remove
any
other
name,
other
than
the
defendant's
name.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
correct,
but
there
was
no
reason
to
delete
the
names
of
those
other
persons.
the
only
name--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--the
jury
i
think,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
is
aware
of
common
usage
of
the
word
deleted,
common
usage
of
blipping
on
television...
it's
the
same
as
when
you
receive...
or,
at
least,
when
i
receive
a
letter
and
something
is
blacked
out
on
a
letter.
your
attention
is
drawn
immediately
to
the
blacked
out
portion
of
the
letter,
and
you
try
to
figure
out
what
is
there.
that
is
the
problem
we
have
here.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
the
only
testimony
that
referred
to
specific...
there
were
two
witnesses
in
this
case,
and
both
only
identified...
there
were
only
two
names
ever
used
at
trial,
other
than
the...
bell,
the
name
of
petitioner,
and
the
name
of
tank.
no
other
names
were
mentioned
by
any
other
witnesses.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
there
was
other
testimony
that
several
other
witnesses
were
involved,
that
is
correct.
but
the
jury,
i
believe,
with
the
term
deleted
would
be
left
to
draw
no
other
conclusion
than,
why
put
this
term
in
here
if
we're
not
trying
to
keep
something
from
us.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
i'm
not
satisfied
with
that
test.
i
believe
that
test
is
too
stringent.
i
don't
believe
that
the
defense
should
have
the
burden,
or
that
there
should
be
an
inevitable
to
that
conclusion.
i
think
if
a
juror
could
reasonably
draw
the
conclusion,
that
is
sufficient,
because
then,
if
the
jury
can
reasonably
draw
that
conclusion,
that
creates
a
substantial
risk.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
the
test
that
the
court
has
thus
far
used
is
the
language
whether
it
creates
a
substantial
risk
of
prejudice
to
the
other
defendant.
i
believe--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--clearly
not.
the
court
of
special
appeals
adopted
what
i
would
consider
the
proper
test,
which
is
the,
paraphrasing
the
test
that
the
court
used
in
bruton,
and
referred
to
that
there
existed
in
this
case
a
substantial
risk
that
the
jury
would
be
forced
to
the
conclusion
that
deleted
and
deletion
referred
to
petitioner,
and
i
think
that
is
the
test
that
should
be
used.
the
introduction
of
the
peti...
codefendant's
redacted
confession
clearly
had
a
devastating
effect
on
petitioner's
case.
as
i
earlier
observed,
there
were
only
two
witnesses
in
this
case.
there
was
only
one
eye
witness
to
the
actual
beating.
the
other
witness
saw
the
parties
running
towards
the
scene,
and
that
witness'
testimony
was
consistent
with
petitioner's
defense.
the
statement
as
admitted
provided
corroboration
for
that
witness'
testimony
as
to
the
parties
involved.
i
think
prejudice
from
that
was
clear.
in
addition,
in
the
state
in
prosecution,
whether
it
was
a
deliberate
or...
deliberate
or
unintentional
sort
of
drew
together
the
statement
that
was
used
and
the
arrest
of
petitioner
to
sort
of
make
it
very
clear
to
the
jury
that
this
statement
actually
led
to
petitioner's
arrest,
so
in
that
sense
it
was
also
prejudicial.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
would
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
your
honor,
in
answer
to--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--that's
a
source
of
confusion
even
within
my
own
family,
but--
[laughter]
--we
use
the
pronunciation
delano.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
in
answer
to
the
court's
question
about
whether
this
was
preserved
or
not,
counsel
at
the
end
of
the
hearing
on
the
admissibility
of
the
statement
clearly
indicated
that
they
objected
to
this
statement
as
admitted,
and
clearly
pointed
out
to
the
court
that
the
statement
as
redacted
strengthened
the
case
of...
against
petitioner.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
the
only
objection
was
on
the
bruton
ground,
and
at
trial
petitioner
was
granted
a
continuing
objection
to
any
testimony
concerning
the
statement
and
it
was
clear
that
this
point
was
preserved,
and
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
preservation
argument
had
never
been
presented
in
any
maryland
court
and
was
not
presented
to
this
court
in
the
brief
in
opposition,
so
i
really
don't
believe
that
issue
is
properly
before
the
court.
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
concerning
the
use
of
deletions,
in
my
brief
i
cited
five
state
courts
that
have
condemned
the
practice
and
three
circuit
courts,
including
judge
friendly's
opinion
where
they
condemned
the
practice
of
deletion.
even
in
those
states
that
have
adopted
the
so
called
facial
implication
doctrine
i
could
find
no
cases
in
which--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--i
would
suppose
that
the
piece
of
paper
would
have
to
be
retyped
or
rewritten.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
perhaps
you
might
not
be
able
to
submit
the
original.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
well--
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
--if
it
showed
a
blank
space,
you
would
not
be
able
to
present
the
original.
the
prosecution
has
the
option
of
substituting
a
typewritten,
but
more
importantly
the
prosecution
has
the
option
at
trial
of
testifying
as
to
what
the
actual
statement
said,
so
that
it's
not
that
they're
not
going
to
get
what
the
statement
has
in
evidence.
they
might
not
get
the
actual
statement
in.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
the
officer...
as
in
this
case,
the
officer
who
took
the
statement.
he's
the
one
who
testified
as
to
what
was
in
the
statement,
and
he's
the
one
who
offered
the
statement
into
evidence.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
yes.
as
in
this
case,
he
modified
what
he
heard
by
saying,
deleted
and
deletion.
he
could
have
modified
and
omitted
the
deleted
and
deletion.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
under
maryland
evidentiary
law
the
court
of
special
appeals
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
of
the
mind
that
this
issue
had
been
preserved
and
again,
the
issue
had
not
been
presented
by
respondent
in
any
form
of
a
cross
petition,
so
i
don't
believe
that
that's
necessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that
issue.
i
think
it's
been
reached
by
the
maryland
courts
and
decided
that
this
was
preserved
as
far
as
maryland
evidentiary
law
was
concerned.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
the
objection
was
entirely
under
bruton.
richardson
was
not
mentioned,
and
at
the
end...
i
may
be
paraphrasing
slightly,
but
the
language
was
that
this
clearly
strengthens
the
case
that
the
redactions
are
not
sufficient,
but
it
still,
under
bruton,
incriminates
the
petitioner,
and
it
strengthens
the
case
against
petitioner.
mr.
arthur
a.
delano,
jr.
that
is
correct.
the
counsel,
defense
counsel
did
not
suggest
an
alternative,
but
i
don't
believe
the
defense
counsel
had
that
absolute
responsibility
under
maryland
law.
and
without
trying
to
lessen
the
significance
of
the
deletions,
because
i
agree
entirely
with
the
court
that
that
is
the
most
damaging
part
in
this
case,
i
would
point
out
that
the
way
that
the
deletions
were
done
in
this
case,
they
used
the
term
deletion
and,
in
juxtaposition
to
the
term,
several
other
witnesses.
that
language
basically
paralleled
the
testimony
at
trial.
it
was
always,
name,
name,
and
several
other
guys,
so
we're
not
here
strictly
with
a
case
of
deletion.
we're
here
with
a
case
of
deletion
plus
several
other
guys,
and
i
think
that
only
aggravates
the...
or
increases
the
potential
for
prejudice.
unless
the
court
has
any
other
questions,
i
would
submit.
