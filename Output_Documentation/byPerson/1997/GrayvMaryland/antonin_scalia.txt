justice
antonin
scalia
well,
don't
you
think
it
would
unduly
favor
your
client
if
all
they
introduce
is
a
statement
that,
you
know,
i
beat
him
up,
so
it
looks
as
though
there
wasn't
a
crowd
of
people,
and
the
jury
looks
at
your
client,
or
at
the
other
defendant
and
says,
gee,
i
guess
he
did
it,
and
looks
at
your
client
and
says,
according
to
this
fellow
there
was
nobody
else
there.
does
the
court
have
to
let
it
in
on
that
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
must
say,
i
don't
understand
why
there's
a
world
of
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
these
other
guys
have
names?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
don't
you...
if
you're
talking
about
redacting
it
to,
instead
of
putting
in
the
blip
you're
putting
in
a
brackets,
and
some
other
guys,
or
is
this
the
actual
statement
we're
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
no
one
suggests
that
instead
of
witing
them
out
you
could
put
in,
bracket,
and
some
other
guys,
close
bracket.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
know
of
any
redactions--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
redactions...
that's
not
an
option,
so
you
either
use
the
statement
blanking
out
stuff,
or
you
don't
use
the
statement.
you
can't
recreate
the
statement
with
brackets.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
really
slow
jury
if
they
can't
figure
out
these
are
names
of
people.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
one
communicates
simply
there
were
some
other
guys.
the
other
communicates
not
just
that
there
were
some
other
guys,
but
that
there's
some
reason
why
you
can't
name
one
of
those
guys.
it
surely
communicates
that
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
do
you
think
the
reason
probably
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it
was
the
other
defendant.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
necessarily--
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
we
adopt
anything
other
than
the
most
rigorous
of
tests?
i
mean,
what's
the
big
deal?
if
you're
worried
about
the
redaction
you
could
try
the
other
individuals
separately.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
can
get
the
whole
thing
in
in
its
full
term.
it
seems
to
me
that...
i'm
not
very
sympathetic
to
your
insistence
that
we
have
to
allow
the
redaction
unless
there's
a
certainty
that
the
jury's
going
to
fill
it
in
with
the
name
of
the
other
defendant.
try
the
two
separately,
then
you
get
the
whole
thing
in,
word
for
word.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
didn't--
--i
guess
bruton
is
wrong,
then.
is
that...
i
mean,
if
all
that
is
true,
bruton
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we've
assumed
the
opposite
of
what
you're
saying.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
just
someone
else,
it's
someone
else
whose
name
i
am
not
allowed
to
tell
you
in
this
trial
committed
the
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mcleese,
what's
the
worst
kind
of
a
different
situation
in
which
we
trust
the
jury
to
obey
an
instruction
from
the
judge
not
to
consider
what
it
has
just
heard.
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--give
me
another
example
that's
as
bad
as
this.
