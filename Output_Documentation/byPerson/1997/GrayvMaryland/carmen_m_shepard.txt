ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
statement,
who
was
in
the
group
that
beat
stacey,
me,
deleted,
deleted,
and
other
guys,
communicates
only
that
mr.
bell
and
others
committed
a
crime.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
i'm
not
entirely
clear
why
they
bothered
to
delete
it.
it
was
one
of
the
many
options.
certainly,
no
one
asked
for
the
option,
me,
and
then
delete
everything
until
you
get
to
other
guys.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
i
disagree,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
natural
conclusion
is,
something
is
missing
here.
beyond
that,
it
is
possible
a
juror
might
say--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--a
juror
very
well
might
even
say,
i
wonder
what
it
is.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
we
think
that
what
the
juror
would
be
likely
to
conclude
is
what
the
court
noted
in
richardson,
which
is,
maybe
it
is
the
name
of
a
person,
but
i
can't
even
use
that--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--well,
it
could
be--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--perhaps
in
this
case,
your
honor--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--but
let
me
give
you
an
example.
towards
the
end
of
the
statement,
who
has
park
heights
jackets,
it
simply
says...
as
read
by
the
detective
it
just
said,
deleted.
in
that
instance,
for
example,
there's
not
even
a
mention
of
whether
it's
one,
two,
three,
four
names--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--i
think...
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
jury
thinks
much
like
it
thinks
when
there's
an
objection
that's
sustained
that
evidence
doesn't
come
in.
there
is
something
here
that
we're
not
allowed
to
consider
as
evidence.
it
is
possible
that
a
juror
might
go
on
to
conclude,
and
that
could
be
a
specific
name.
it
could
be
a
specific
person.
but
there's
nothing
necessarily
in
simply
the
fact
of
a
redaction
or
the
fact
of
a
deletion
that
would
necessarily
lead
a
juror
to
conclude,
(a)
that
it's
the
identity
of
someone
and,
even
further,
that
it
has
to
be
the
identity
of
this
one
other
person.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
i
think
that
would
exalt
form
over
substance.
that
is,
the
statement,
me
and
a
few
other
guys,
me,
and
then
followed
maybe
by
six
blanks,
five
blanks,
both
communicate
the
same
thing,
or
a
mixture
thereof,
two
blanks
and
then
some
other
guys,
or
even
three
blanks
and
some
other
guys.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
it--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--not
necessarily.
it
could
be--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--a
confidential
informant.
it
could
be
someone
who's
awaiting
trial.
there
are
many--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--i
wouldn't
disagree
with
you,
your
honor.
that
is,
we
don't
need
to
resolve
this
case
by
concluding
that
a
juror
would
not
speculate
as
to
what
could
be
there.
that
is,
we
would
concede
that
a
juror
might
speculate,
that
a
juror
might
even
speculate
there's
a
name,
and
that
a
juror
might
even
wonder--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--perhaps.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
i
think,
your
honor,
because
ultimately
the
question
of
how
a
statement
needs
to
be
redacted
is
one
that
requires
a
balancing
of
a
great
many
factors.
whether
in
one
case
it's
better
in
some
way
to
use
a
richardson
redaction,
or
to
use
a
deletion,
might
change
from
statement
to
statement
to
statement.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
argue
that
that
statement
is
necessary.
it
simply
wasn't
redacted.
no
one
requested
that
it
be
redacted.
the
identities
were
redacted.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
there
was
no
objection
to
the
form
of
the
redaction
in
this
particular
instance.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
correct,
your
honor.
they
did
not
suggest...
i'm
not
meaning
to
suggest
that
they
did
not
object
to
the
confession
coming
in,
but
they
did
not
object
to
this
form
of
redaction,
that
is,
that
the
use
of
blanks
or
deleted
versus
a
retyping,
versus
the
use
of
pseudonyms,
for
example,
there
was
no
suggestion
as
to
that.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
and
did
so,
your
honor,
in
very
clear
and
unmistakable
terms.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
precisely
our
argument.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
true,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
because,
your
honor,
that
confession
on
its
face
expressly
inculpated
the
defendant.
that
is,
there
is
a
significance--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--correct,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
yes,
your
honor.
i
believe
the
issue
of
redaction,
what
to
redact,
how
to
redact,
should
be
left
in
the
first
instance
to
the
trial
court
based
on
the
feasibility
of
redaction.
in
some
instance
that
will
be
the
practical
visibility.
is
it
a
video,
for
example?
it
may
make
it
very
difficult
to
redact
without
indicating
there
has
been
a
deletion.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
i
would
be
arguing
against
that.
for
example,
i'm
using
a
video
as
a
way
to
suggest
that
redactions
that
indicate
there's
a
deletion
are
perhaps
inevitable...
for
example,
through
the
use
of
video...
unless,
of
course,
the
cost
were
not
to
allow
video
confessions,
which--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--yes.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
your
honor,
we
share
the
view
of
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
and
the
view
that
you
previously
expressed
as
to
the
test.
it
should
focus
on
whether
the
confession
expressly
implicates,
identifies
the
defendant,
or
does
the
equivalent
of
identifying
the
defendant.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
well,
your
honor,
there
is--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--the
reason
for
that,
your
honor,
is
the
judgment,
we
believe
correct
in
our
case,
that
this
court
has
recognized
before,
that
joint
trials
are
of
vital
importance
to
our
system,
that
there
is
a
cost
of
foregoing
a
joint
trial,
a
cost
to
society,
a
cost
to
the
administration
of
the
criminal
justice
system,
sometimes
a
cost
to
one
of
the
codefendants,
whose
best
shot
at
a
defense
is
to
stand
side
by
side
with
someone
who's
more
culpable.
those
are
very
real
costs
that
this
court
has
previously
recognized.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
let
me
answer
it
this
way,
justice
kennedy.
i
believe
in
some
ways
that
is
incorrect.
that
is,
bruton
does
rest
on
a
value
judgment:
what
do
we
think
jurors
will
do?
it
is
an
issue
of
fact
that
is
unprovable
and
unknowable
in
all
likelihood.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
if
one
assumes
that
the
jury
cannot
follow
the
instruction
not
to
use
this
evidence
against
a
particular
defendant.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
there
was
not,
and
there
still
is
not.
that
is,
the
statistics,
or
the
studies,
to
the
extent
they're
even
capable
of
divining
jury
behavior,
indicate
that
jurors
try
to
follow
instructions,
that
where
the
instructions
are
clear,
that's
what
they
will
endeavor
to
do.
and
we
do
know
this
much
from
our
practical
experience,
that
day
after
day
in
trial
courts
jurors
are
told,
not
even
by
a
codefendant
but
by
the
prosecutor,
we
believe,
we
the
state
believe
this
person
is
guilty
of
a
crime
in
opening
statements
and
closing
statements.
those
jurors
are
told
that
is
not
evidence,
and
juries
are
capable
of
making
decisions
based
on
the
evidence.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
we
don't
need
to
decide--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--we
don't
need
to
decide
that
issue,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
we
did
not,
and
that
issue
is
not
before
the
court.
we're
not
urging
the
court
to--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--well,
your
honor,
i--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--i
explain
that,
your
honor,
to
this
extent.
that
is,
we
understand
bruton.
bruton
lays
down
a
rule
that
can
be
followed.
what
we
are
here
today
for
is
to
make...
is
to
argue
that
that
area,
that
area
where
the
court
has
said
juries
cannot
be
trusted,
is
not
expanded
beyond
the
statement,
this
codefendant
committed
the
crime,
to
an
area
where
the
statement
is
simply,
and
all
it
communicates
is,
someone
else
committed
the
crime.
that
is,
a
group
of
people
committed
the
crime.
that
is
not
the
kind
of
statement
that
bruton--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--even
if
you
go
that
far,
justice
scalia--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--someone
else--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--i
think
not,
your
honor,
and
let
me
answer
that
question
in
two
ways.
one
is,
there
was
no
objection
to
that
at
that
point
in
the
defense,
so
that
had
to
have
been
preserved.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
we
think
the
reason
for
the
lack
of
objection--
[laughter]
the
reason
for
the
lack
of
objection
was
another.
that
is,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
in
the
context
of
the
questioning,
what
actually
happened
was,
they
asked
the
detective,
what
information
did
you
develop?
i
went,
interviewed
witnesses.
based
on
that,
what
did
you
do?
i
got
an
arrest
warrant.
what
did
you
do
then?
i
went
to
look
for
mr.
bell
and
mr.
gray.
i
found
mr.
bell.
i
could
not
find
mr.
gray.
so
what
did
you
do
next?
i
brought
mr.
bell
in,
i
got
his
statement.
were
you
subsequently
able
to
arrest
mr.
gray?
there
is
no
tying
in
at
all
of
mr.
gray
to
the
statement
of
mr.
bell.
it
was
simply
understood
in
its
context.
it's
a
chronology,
and
in
fact
the
decision
on
the
arrest
warrant
had
been
made
before
mr.
bell's
confession
was
obtained.
your
honor,
we
believe
that
the
trial
courts
need
the
discretion
to
determine
what
redaction
best
can
balance
the
concerns
of
the
sixth
amendment
and
the
needs
of
the
trial.
in
any
given
case,
a
court
might
conclude
that
a
richardson
redaction
is
appropriate.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
that
is
one
of
the
factors
that
ought
to
be
considered
in
determining
whether
a
deletion
in
a
particular
case
should
be
used,
as
opposed
to
a
rewrite
of
the
confession.
that
is--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--well,
that
is
ultimately,
your
honor,
also
a
possibility,
certainly,
whether
the
confession
comes
in
at
all,
but
certainly
we
should
respect
the
desire
to
include
confessions
in
trials,
and
we
should
respect
the
importance
of
joint
trials.
beyond
that,
what
a
trial
court
may
use
in
determining
how
best
to
redact
is
both
matters
of
the
practicality
of
the
redaction,
matters
of
the
substantive
communication,
does
it
so
distort
the
meaning.
a
court
may
also
take
into
account
the
interests
of
the
defendant,
the
interests
of
the
codefendant,
the
interest
of
the
state,
and
in
any
given
confession
and
in
any
given
statement,
that
balance
may
result
in
one
form
of
redaction
or
another.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
i
think
i
understand
your
question.
i'm
not
sure,
beyond
giving
the
trial
courts,
that
is,
the
ultimate
rule
and
the
ultimate
goal.
that
is,
the
responsibility
here
is
to
make
sure
that
a
statement
or
a
confession
that
comes
in
does
not
directly
or
by
compelling
or
inevitable
inference
identify
the
defendant.
it
is
possible
the
trial
courts
might
have
a
different
judgment
in
a
particular
statement,
but
that
is
almost
impossible
to
anticipate
or
correct,
and
the
judgment
may
change,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
statement,
too.
i
believe
it
might...
it
would
not
be
possible
to
give
more
firm
guidance
than
simply
making
sure
that
at
the
end
when
a
confession
is
admitted
it
does
not,
in
fact,
expressly
incriminate
or
inculpate--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--it
would,
your
honor,
but
it
would
not
accomplish
the
purposes
of
the
sixth
amendment,
necessarily,
that
is,
and
again--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--not
necessarily,
your
honor,
because
it
will
come
perhaps...
for
example,
in
this
case,
it
might
change
the
evidence
as
to
mr.
bell.
mr.
bell's
best
defense
may
have
been
here,
well,
i
had
a
part
in
it,
but
it
was
really
a
small
part,
all
i
did
was
this,
and
so
a
codefendant
might
have
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
the
fullness
of
the
story
be
told,
and
that
the
redaction--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--absolutely,
your
honor,
and
we
can't
require
him
to
sacrifice
that,
but
he
nevertheless
has
an
interest
in
making
sure
that
as
much
of
his
confession--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--i
believe
the
defendant,
whether
the
statement
is
truthful
or
not,
certainly
has
an
interest
in
deciding
and
determining
that
as
much
as
possible
of
the
statement
in
the
form
that
he
gave
it
comes
in
in
that
fashion,
so
to
avoid,
for
example,
the
prejudice
that
might
occur
from
a
statement
that
communicates
i
and
mr.
bell
and
only
mr.
bell
cause
this
harm
to
the
victim.
that's
a
legitimate
interest,
and
that's
one
that
could
be
balanced
out
and
perhaps
might
better
be
balanced
out
by
use
of
a
deletion
or
some
form
of
redaction.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
that's
a
little
difficult
for
me
to
answer,
justice
kennedy.
i
suspect
because
we
are
the
state
we
would
be
in
a
position
to
argue
that
much
of
that
statement
would
come
in
as
a
declaration--
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
--not
otherwise,
your
honor.
ms.
carmen
m.
shepard
yes,
your
honor.
the
benefits...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
