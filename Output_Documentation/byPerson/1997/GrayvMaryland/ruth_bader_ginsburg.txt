mr.
delano,
why
must
it...
must
your
position--
--yes.
--why
do
you
put
this
in
terms
of
has
to
be?
i
thought
you
were
emphasizing
that
when
the
transcript...
that
when
what
the
jury
sees
says,
delete,
blank
space,
that
that
juts
out.
isn't
there
a
difference
whether
you're
wrong
about
the
other
of
a...
something
that
shows
delete,
blank,
and
something
that
says,
and
a
couple
of
other
guys?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
marsh
different
in
that
respect?
did
marsh
have
the
delete,
wite
out--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--ms.
shepard,
there
was
a
very
fine
jurist
who
once
said
on
this
subject,
the
temptation
to
fill
in
the
blanks
is
nigh
irresistible.
i
don't
think
you
have
to
have
a
legal
mind
to
see
that.
the
natural...
when
one
is
faced
with
a
blank
one
thinks,
well,
which
one
was
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
that
speculation
would
be
nigh
irresistible.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
if
the
government
could
get
across
the
same
information
without
having,
name
deleted,
or
wite
out,
why
isn't
that
the
appropriate
way
to
proceed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
ms.
shepard,
one
problem
with
leaving
it
all
up
to
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge
is,
i've
given
you
the
response
of
one
judge,
nigh
irresistible
inference.
another
one
should
say,
no,
there's
not
any
necessary
inference.
it
could
be
anybody,
mr.
x,
could
be
mr.
white,
mr.
gray.
so
it
just...
there's
a
tremendous
amount
of
disparity
if
you
just
say,
well,
it's
up
to
the
trial
judge,
and
given
that
range,
that
one
would
say,
perfectly
okay
to
have
blanks,
and
the
other
one
says
the
jury
is
going
to
make
that
inference,
i
know
they
are,
so
i'm
going
to
keep
it
from
them.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
could
that
be
because
of
the
warning
that
this
court
gave
in
marsh,
the
footnote
that
says,
we
express
no
opinion
on
the
admissibility
of
a
confession
in
which
the
defendant's
name
has
been
replaced
with
a
symbol?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
think
when
justice
o'connor
started
reading
how
this
might
have
been
presented
and
she
said,
me
and
a
few
other
guys,
that
is
a
distinction
from
me
and
delete,
delete.
