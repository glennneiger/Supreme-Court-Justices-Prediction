mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
richardson,
the
court
rejected
a
confrontation
clause
challenge
to
one
category
of
redacted
confession,
those
which
make
no
mention
at
all
of
the
existence
of
the
complaining
defendant.
our
submission
in
the
present
case
is
that
the
court
should
reach
the
same
conclusion
as
to
a
second
category
of
redacted
confession,
those
which
do
not
name
or
describe
the
complaining
defendant.
such
confessions
do
not
vividly
and
facially
incriminate
the
complaining
defendant,
and
thus
are
quite
different
from
the
confession
at
issue
in
bruton.
in
addition,
the
costs
of
expanding
bruton--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--to
answer
that
question--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--well,
there
would
be
costs
to
that
if
what
you
mean
is
a
manner
of
redaction
that
would
not
be
apparent
to
the
jury
at
all,
so
the
jury
would
not
know
that
there
had
been
any
redaction
at
all.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
one
could
have
deleted...
one
could
have
redacted
this
confession
so
that
you
didn't
have
the
obvious
blanks.
i
think
it
would
have
been
impossible,
while
still
using
the
signed
confession,
to
redact
it
in
a
way
so
that
it
would
not
have
been
apparent
to
the
jury
that
there
had
been
some
kind
of
redaction
that
took
place.
but
to
use
this
case
as
an
example,
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
the
redaction
was
achieved
here
by
using
deletion,
something
that
was
not
the
subject
of
an
objection,
sufficiently
or
significantly
increased
the
risks
that
the
jury
would
infer
that
bell
named
petitioner.
there
were
a
number
of
deletions.
there
were
a
number
of
names
that
were
deleted,
so
the
jury
would
not
have,
had
it
been
inclined
to
speculate,
had
it
been
inclined
to
disregard
its
instructions
not
to
do
that,
it
would
not
have
reached
the
natural
conclusion
that
these
deletions
must
be
driven
by
the
fact
that
petitioner
must
have...
that
declarant
must
have
named
petitioner,
because
a
number
of
names
were
deleted.
the
jury,
had
it
speculated,
could
have
concluded
only--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--i
don't
think
the
jury
here,
had
it
been
inclined
to
speculate,
would
have
had
any
reason
to
speculate
that
the
names
in
bell's
confession
happened
to
map
on
to
bell
and
tank
as
opposed
to
other
names
in
this
group.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
tank
was
not
involved
in
this
courtroom,
either,
and
the
jury,
again
had
it
been
inclined
to
speculate
and
disregard
instructions,
would
have
had
no
reason
to
surmise
that...
had
no
reason
to
think
that
tank's
name
would
need
to
be
deleted.
i
think
if
the
jury
had
been
speculating
it
would
have
been
speculating
only
that
whoever
bell
named,
there
must
be
some
rule
that
says
that
all
those
names
don't
come
in,
and
the
jury
would
have
had
no
reason
to
guess
that
among
the
people
bell
named
was
petitioner.
there
would
have
been...
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
deletion
would
not
have
been
a
red
flag
that
would
have
taken
the
jury
anywhere
even
if
the
jury
had
been
inclined
to
try
to
follow
that
up.
they
had--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--i
think
that...
i
don't
think
that
even
with
a
slate
that
includes
bruton
the
conclusion
you
describe
would
dictate
an
unfavorable
answer
for
the
state
here,
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is
the
following.
i
think
that
richardson,
for
example,
makes
clear
that
this
area
does
not
turn
on
the
mere,
even
certainty
that
the
jury
will
end
up
through
a
chain
of
inference
reaching
a
conclusion
that
evidence
is
incriminating
but
must
be
set
aside.
what
richardson
says
is,
even
where,
through
a
chain
of
inference,
the
jury
may
get
to
that
point,
we
can
trust
juries,
as
we
trust
them
to
set
aside
other
things,
many
other
things,
to
set
that
aside,
that
bruton
is
a
very
narrow
exception
to
that
rule
that
arises
in
circumstances
where
as
a
self
contained
unit
the
confession
comes
in
in
a
form
that
says
this
person
committed
the
offense
with
me,
so
it's
not...
i
don't
think
that
even
if
one
were
to
conclude
that
the
inference
is
one
that
the
jury
would
have
drawn
in
a
particular
case
eventually,
had
it
sat
down
and
done
everything,
i
don't
think
that
supports
the
conclusion
there
was
a
bruton
violation.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
two
cases
come--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--well,
two
come
to
mind.
spencer
v.
texas
is
a
case
in
which,
at
the
defendant's
murder
trial,
the
jury
is
informed
that
the
defendant
has
a
prior
murder
conviction
and
is
told,
do
not
consider
that
in
determining
guilt
or
innocence.
set
that
aside
when
you
determine
guilt
or
innocence.
consider
it
solely
for
purposes
of
the
appropriate
sentence
that
you
will
later
impose
in
a
single
guilt
and
sentencing
proceeding.
another
comparable
example
is
harris
v.--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--but
the
relevant
inquiry
here
is
whether
the
risk
of
jury
inability
to
set
aside
incriminating
evidence
is
a
constitutional
violation,
and
what
spencer
v.
texas
said,
whatever
jurisdiction--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--i
do
agree
with
that.
the
other
answer
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
is
harris
v.
new
york,
where
statements
that
are
taken
illegally,
in
violation
of
miranda,
are
admitted
to
the
jury
and
the
jury
is
told,
you
may
consider
this
confession,
this
statement
solely
for
purposes
of
assessing
the
credibility,
the
testimonial
credibility
of
the
defendant.
you
must
set
it
aside
as
it
might
be
considered
substantive
evidence
of
the
defendant's
guilt,
and
i--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--no.
the
rule
that
we--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--the
rule
we
propose
is
limited
to
confessions
which
do
not
contain
additional
descriptive
information
of
the
kind
that
you
suggest.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
in
this
case--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--with
respect
to
confessions,
confessions
that
are...
even
as
redacted
contain
additional
descriptive
information.
when
that
descriptive
information
is
so
vividly
and
obviously
linked
to
the
defendant...
the
example
that
comes
to
mind
is
this
court's
decision
in
harrington--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--i
think
that
that
is
a
widely...
redaction
that
would
be
apparent
to
the
jury,
perhaps,
but
that
deletes
the
names,
is
a
relatively
common
practice
in
the
state
and
federal
system.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
that
is
less
clear.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
that
is
less
clear.
i
think
it's
very
hard--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--it's
very
hard
to
tell
how
common
a
practice
that
is.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
if
i
were
aware
that
it
were
common,
i
certainly
would
have.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
that
is...
when
you
say
this
is
not
a
common
practice--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--in
the
federal
system
there
certainly
is
not
a
lot
of
lower
court
case
law
addressing
that
particular
method
of
redaction.
there--
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
--i
should
be
clear
that,
on
the
other
hand,
redactions
that
continue
to
describe
the
role
of
the
unnamed
other
participants
by
use
of
terms
other
than
deletion,
like
the
other
guy,
or
him,
that
is
an
extremely
common
practice
in
the
federal
courts
areas
and
has
met
widespread
acceptance
in
the
lower
federal
courts.
in
fact,
the
overwhelming
weight
of
authority
in
the
federal
courts
is
to
approve
that
practice.
mr.
roy
w.
mcleese,
iii
that's
true.
we
don't
think
the
constitutional
answer
turns
on
that
distinction.
