justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the...
you
can't
substitute
for
the
defendant's
name
a
concrete
description.
you
couldn't
say,
the
man
with
the
red
hair
and
the
limp.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
what
is
the
rule,
in
your
opinion,
about
when
a
blank
separated
by
commas
or
some
other
pictorial
depiction
in
a
written
confession
is
equivalent
to
the
red
eyed
man,
or
red
haired
man
with
the
limp?
what's
the...
how
would
you
decide
that
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
in
fact...
i
think
one
argument
is
that
a
blank
separated
by
commas
in
the
circumstance
is
quite
close
to
a
particular
description
because
it
sets
the
jury
to
thinking,
and
they
see
blank,
blank,
and
some
other
guys,
and
they
know
who
that
is
just
as
if
it
said,
the
red
haired
man
with
the
limp.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what's
the
test
to
decide
whether
they're
right
or
not?
how
would
you
formulate
the
test
that
would
distinguish
the
blanks,
or
however
you
want
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--vivid
and
obvious,
and
if
not
that,
if
we
accepted
their
view,
are
there
many,
many
retrials
that
would
be
necessary
throughout
the
country?
that
is
to
say,
if
this
interpretation
of
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
is...
in
other
words,
has
it
been
a
habit
of
prosecutors
simply
to
redact
through
the
use
of
a
blank
with
a
comma?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
assume...
is
it
fair
to
assume
that
if
you
thought
this
practice
were
common
you
would
have
told
us
that?
you
would
have
gotten
complaints--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
people
haven't
been
complaining
to
you
about
it.
i
mean,
the
case
is
well
publicized,
and
people
know
about
it,
prosecutors
know
about
it.
is
it
a
fair
assumption
from
the
fact
that
you
don't
know
about
it
that
this
is
not
a
common
practice?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
use
of
the
word
deletion,
deletion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
they
supposed
to
do
it?
presumably
there's
a
physical
document
with
some
writing
on
it,
and
the
physical
document
then
has
some
names
on
it,
and
so
how
in
your
opinion
is
the...
is
this
piece
of
paper
supposed
to
be
presented
into
evidence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
you
can't
submit
the
original.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what
do
you...
when
you
say
perhaps,
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
precisely
do
you
think
is
supposed
to
happen?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
the
case,
going
to
be
the
case
when
we
get
into
this
record
and
so
forth
we'll
find
that
you
didn't...
there's
no
one
suggesting
that
the
way
to
do
this
is
to
simply
read
the
confession
and
leave
the
names
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
are
we
supposed
to
deal
with
that,
that
this
alternative
wasn't
presented
to
the
judge?
