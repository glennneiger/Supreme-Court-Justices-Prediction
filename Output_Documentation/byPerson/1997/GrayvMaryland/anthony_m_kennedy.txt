i
would
like
to
go
back
to
the
very
first
question
that
justice
o'connor
had,
because
i
want
to
be
clear
about
your
answer,
and
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
it.
the
statement
is
altered
so
that
it
says,
who
was
in
the
group
that
beat
stacey,
and
the
redacted
statement
does
not
use
the
word
delete,
deleted,
it
does
not
have
wite
out,
it
just
says,
me
and
a
few
other
guys.
should
that
be
admitted
by
the
trial
judge,
and
if
not,
why
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
does
the
admission
of
the
statement,
as
i
have
described
it,
violate
the
confrontation
clause?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
would
you
agree
that
this
is...
would...
if
the
case
turned
on
the
admissibility
of
this
statement
as
to
whether
or
not
it
was
against
the
declarant's
penal
interest,
would
you
agree
that
it
probably
does
not
meet
that
test,
because
there
are
substantial
exculpatory
or
mitigating
reasons
why
he
might
want
to
make
that
statement?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
find
that
there's
a
powerful,
compelling
inference
that
defendant
is
a
person
named
in
the
confession,
disagreeing
with
your
analysis,
and
if
we
were
writing
on
a
clean
slate,
no
bruton,
would
there
be
any
way
to
admit
this
statement?
