paul

that's
the
only
one.
so
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
there's
a--
--in
this
case--
--no,
there's
a
third
option
that
justice
o'connor
questioned.
the
statement
as
we
have
it
is
me,
deleted,
deleted,
and
a
few
other
guys.
the
question
put
to
you
was,
suppose
it
just
said,
me
and
a
few
other
guys,
without
showing
any
deletion,
so
that's
a
third
option.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
that...
i
mean,
what's
a
jury
supposed
to
think,
that
they
deleted
it
because
of
john
smith,
who's
not
in
the
courtroom,
his
name
is
in
there?
i
mean,
what
is
a
jury
supposed
to
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
just
one
question,
if
i
may?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the...
on
one
side
of
the
scale
is,
you
want
to
get
all
of
the
statement
in
that
tends
to
incriminate
the
maker
of
the
statement,
bell,
and
you
have
no
right
to
put
anything
in
that
doesn't
incriminate
him,
isn't
that
correct?
and
you
have
a
statement
here,
who
else
has
these
jackets,
answer,
deletion.
what
possible
purpose
could
that
question
serve
in
terms
of
the
proper
purpose
for
the
confession,
namely,
incriminating
bell?
justice
john
paul
stevens
really?
they
accepted
this
without
objection?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
those
arguments
would
have
even
greater
weight
if
bruton
itself
were
somehow
questionable,
if
we
were
using
this
rule
because
bruton
was
too
harsh.
i
have
seen
nothing
in
the
commentary
or
in
the
briefs
to
suggest
that
latter
proposition,
though.
it
is
a
given,
is
it
not,
or
maybe
i'm
incorrect,
that
bruton
is
absolutely
correct.
there
was
a
cardinal
violation
of
confrontation
when
you
cannot
examine
a
witness
who
implicates
you
by
a
previous
statement,
or
am
i
incorrect
about
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
does
it
rest
on
what
you
call
a
value
judgment
after
everyone
adopts
the
premise
that
there
would
be
a
confrontation
problem,
that
there
is
a
confrontation
violation
if
the
statement
comes
in
and
there
can
be
no
cross
examination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
beyond
that,
the
next
question
by
the
prosecutor
after
reading
the
statement,
all
right,
now
officer,
after
he
gave
you
that
information
you
subsequently
were
able
to
arrest
mr.
kevin
gray,
is
that
correct,
didn't
that
pretty
much
create
an
inference
that
they'd
been
talking
about
gray?
justice
john
paul
stevens
perhaps
it
might
not
have
been
very
wise
tactics
to
get
up
and
start
screaming
right
at
that
point,
i
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
is
something
disturbing
about
giving
to
the
jury
a
statement
which
is,
in
a
sense,
fictional,
and
in
some
courts
counsel
and
the
judge
even
agree
that
there
is
a
completely
fictional
statement.
they
have
it
made
at
a
different
place,
when
the
defendant
was
alone
in
the
police
car
when
he
really
wasn't.
this
is
at
some
level
somewhat
offensive
to
the
system,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
a
sufficient
interest
to
get
on
the
witness
stand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
you're
really
saying
this
statement
was
not
a
statement
against
the
interest
of
the
declarant.
you're
sort
of
describing
it
as
a
self
serving
statement
that
ought
to
get
in
to
prove
that
he's
not
as
guilty
as
the
other
guy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
there
would
have
been
no
reason
to
delete
the
names
of
third
parties
who
were
not
involved
in
the
courtroom,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
may
not
be
as
persuasive
as
it
might
have
been,
because
most
states
after
that
have
taken
a
different
view
on
separating
sentencing
from
guilt
just
because
of
the
obvious
risk
of
prejudice
in
that
very
situation,
so
you
sort
of
have
a
general
consensus
that
that
case,
maybe
there
was
no
constitutional
violation,
but
there
was
obvious
unfairness
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
do...
no
doubt
about
the
fact,
if
they
did
treat
this
as
admissible
against
the
codefendant
it
would
be
a
blatant
constitutional
violation.
you
would
agree
with
that?
