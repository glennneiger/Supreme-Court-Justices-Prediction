justice

day
o'connor
mr.
delano,
do
you
take
the
view
that
if
this
had
been
redacted
a
little
differently,
so
that
it
didn't
show
deletion
and
so
that
it
said,
for
example,
who
was
in
the
group
that
beat
stacey...
if
it
just
said,
me
and
a
few
other
guys,
for
example,
that
would
be
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
think
there's
any
way
this
could
have
been
redacted
that
would
satisfy
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
do
you
disagree
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
don't
think
it
could
be
redacted
to
say,
me
and
a
few
other
guys.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
asking
whether
it's
necessary.
i'm
asking
whether
it
can
be
permitted
constitutionally--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it
looks
to
me
like
that
doesn't
point
to
anybody,
if
you
say,
me
and
a
few
other
guys.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
evidence
in
this
case
showed
there
was
quite
a
gang
of
men
who
were
involved,
somehow,
or
who
at
least
confronted
stacey
at
one
point.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
only
two
were
charged.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
evidence
served
no
legitimate
purpose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
can't
make
it--
--let
me
ask
you
something
else.
bell's
statement
strikes
me
as
maybe
a
declaration
against
bell's
penal
interest.
is
that
possible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
admissible
as
a
result
on
that
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
some
of
it
does,
and
i
would
assume,
at
least
to
that
extent,
it's
admissible
on
that
basis.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
test
is
not
whether
it
incriminates
other
persons.
it's
whether
there's
an
inevitable
inference
that
inculpates
the
nonconfessing
codefendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
other
persons.
there
are
no
other
persons
here
before
us
who
are
making
that
argument.
we're
not
concerned
about
them.
we're
concerned
about
the
codefendant,
aren't
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
prejudice
to
whom?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
delano,
would
you
tell
us
what
you
think
the
test
is
for
determining
a
bruton
violation
in
these
circumstances?
as
i
understand
it,
the
court
below
applied
a
test
to
the
effect
that
a
bruton
violation
occurs
when
a
codefendant's
confession,
either
facially
or
by
compelling
and
inevitable
inference,
inculpates
a
nonconfessing
defendant.
are
you
satisfied
with
that
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
adopted
a
test
here?
i
mean,
what
do
you
rely
on
as
pointing
us
to
the
proper
test
to
be
used?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that's
not
as
strict
as
compelling
and
inevitable
inference.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
something
else.
i
mean,
i
think
your
inference
isn't
as
generous
as
it
has
to
be,
but
what
if
the
deletion
in
the
one
statement
that
we're
going
back
to
made
it
read
in
answer,
me
and
a
few
other
guys,
without
deletion
and
deletion
in
there.
is
that
less
likely
that
the
jury
would
draw
the
inference
that
the
petitioner
was
one
of
the
people?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
instruction
was
given
in
the
bruton
case,
too,
wasn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
court
nonetheless
held
in
that
case
there
was
a
violation
of
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
well,
then
i
guess
this
court
left
open
in
marsh
whether
a
redacted
confession
would
be
okay,
didn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that's
what
we're
trying
to
decide
here.
would
you
help
us
with
what
test
you
think
we
ought
to
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
so
if
it's
too
difficult
to
redact,
the
whole
thing
comes
in?
is
that
what
you're
arguing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
excuse
me.
i
thought
you
were
going
to
help
us
with
an
articulation
of
what
the
test
is.
the
maryland
court
below
applied
this
either
facially
or
by
compelling
an
inevitable
inference
inculpates
the
nonconfessing
defendant.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
right
test?
the
petitioner
says
no,
that
it
should
be
whether
there's
a
substantial
risk
that
it
would
inculpate
the
codefendant,
which
is
drawn
from
language
of
our
earlier
opinions.
what
is
the
test?
what
should
it
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
and
maryland
didn't
cross
petition
and
bring
that
here,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
certainly
could
have.
given
your
view,
it's
rather
surprising
that
you
didn't,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
explain
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
certainly
could
adopt
a
rule
saying,
in
redacting
we're
not
going
to
use
the
fill
in
the
blank
form
of
redaction.
that
would
be
simple
enough,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
would
go
a
step
in
that
direction,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
i
think
we're
really
talking
about
the
fill
in
the
blank
sort
of
approach
here
for
redaction.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
don't
we
just
eliminate
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
the
extent
that
it's
possible
you
avoid
fill
in
the
blanks.
it
was
sure
possible
here.
you
easily
could
have
redacted
this
one
so
that
you
didn't
leave
it
deletion,
deletion,
with
an
obvious
fill
in
the
blank
sort
of
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
was
the...
bell
and
tank
i
think
is
all
that
we're
talking
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
where
you
say,
physically,
deletion,
deletion,
as
opposed
to
simply
leaving
it
out--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--so
that
it
says
me
and
other
guys,
instead
of
me,
deletion,
deletion,
and
a
bunch
of
other
guys?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
don't
know.
