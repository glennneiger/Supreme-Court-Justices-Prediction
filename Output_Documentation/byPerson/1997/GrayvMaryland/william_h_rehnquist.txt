chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-8653,
kevin
d.
gray
v.
maryland.
we'll
wait
just
a
minute.
mr.
delano.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't,
you
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
if
some...
the...
it
wasn't
necessary
for
the
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
does
that
figure
into
the
bruton
marsh
calculus?
i
don't
recall
those
cases
first
analyzing
whether
the
evidence
was
"necessary"
for
the
prosecution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
analysis
at
all
of
necessity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
do
you
bring
it
up
here?
are
you
asking
us
to
extend
bruton?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say,
unnecessarily?
i
mean,
ordinarily
evidence
is
admissible,
and
you
know,
you
have
to
show
some
reason
why
it
isn't.
this
certainly
sounds
like
relevant
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
where
do
you
get
that
analysis
from?
it
doesn't
come
out
of
bruton,
it
doesn't
come
out
of
marsh,
and
yet
that
is
the
basis
on
which
the
maryland
court
of
appeals
decided
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
do
you
say
the
jury
would
likely
infer
from
the
word
deleted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
is
that?
why
do
you
say
the
jury
would
most
likely
have
reached
that
conclusion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
there
was
evidence
that
other
people,
other
than
those
who
were
indicted,
had
participated,
was
there
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
jury
doesn't
know
that.
the
jury
isn't
apprised
of
the
bruton
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
here,
if
the
jurors
do
sit
and
try
to
figure
out
what
is
there,
they
could
have
come
to
not
just
one
but
it
seems
to
me
several
conclusions.
it
could
have
referred
to
any
one
of
the
people
whom
testimony
indicated
had
participated
in
this
thing,
some
of
whom
were
not
the
codefendant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
wasn't
there
testimony
that
other
people,
although
perhaps
not
by
name,
had
participated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
delano.
ms.
shepard,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
was
no
objection
to
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
shepard,
did
the
trial
court
charge
the
jury
in
this
case
at
the
time
bell's...
that
it
was
to
be
used
only
against
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
the
jury
followed
that
instruction
it
would
not
have
used
it
against
mr.
gray.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
statistical
evidence
in
bruton
indicating
juries
don't
follow
instructions
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
was
any
objection
ever
made
on
the
ground,
not
the
bruton
ground
but
on
the
ground
that
it
was
not
a
permissible
exception
to
the
confrontation
clause
otherwise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
bruton
ground
was
the
only
one
asserted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
your
time
has
expired,
ms.
shepard.
mr.
mcleese,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mcleese.
mr.
delano,
you
have
11
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
proper
pronunciation
of
your
name
delano,
or
delano?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
delano.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
was
objection
made
on
the
non
bruton
ground
that
it
just
was
a
violation
of,
perhaps
the
confrontation
clause
on
some
other
basis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
would
testify?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
would
testify
and
slightly
modify
what
he
actually
heard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
delano.
the
case
is
submitted.
