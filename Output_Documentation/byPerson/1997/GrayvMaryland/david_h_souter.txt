okay,
and
you
agree
that
the
risk
of
prejudice
is
a
world
apart,
a
world
of
difference,
depending
upon
whether
you
use
the
word
deleted
or
whether
you
use
a
generic
term
like,
me
and
some
other
guys.
there's
a
big
difference,
isn't
there?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
are
they
bothering
to
delete
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
juror's
reasonable
reaction,
on
hearing
that,
to
ask
the
question,
why
are
they
placing
this
word
deletion
in
place
of
whatever
it
was
he
spoke,
and
isn't
the
likely
answer
to
that
question,
because
it
refers
to
this
other
guy
in
the
other
chair
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
juror
would
never
say,
gee,
i
wonder
what
it
is?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
if
he
did,
what
would
he
be
likely
to
conclude?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
take
it
that
it's
the
name
of
a
person,
don't
they?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
doesn't
the
context
make
that
clear
beyond
doubt?
justice
david
h.
souter
or
whether
the
confession
ought
to
come
in
at
all
in
the
joint
trial.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
telling
us
that
when
we
go
to
the
objection
what
we
will
find
is
something
that
says
in
so
many
words
the
confession
ought
to
be
kept
out
because
this
is
not
good
enough
under
bruton,
something
like
that,
is
that
what--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
the
only
thing
you
didn't
do
was
get
up
and
say,
i'll
tell
you
how
to
do
it
right.
