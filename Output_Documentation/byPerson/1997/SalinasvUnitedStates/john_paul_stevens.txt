of
course,
it's
clear
the
statute
would
apply
in
those
cases.
but
are
you
suggesting
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
how
federal
prisoners
are
treated
when
they're
housed
in
state
facilities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
this?
i...
i...
i
guess
i
didn't
read
it
the
same
way
justice
o'connor
did.
i
thought
the
transaction
was
the
conjugal
visit,
and
that
that
had
a
value
of
over
$5,000.
isn't
that
what
the
court
below
relied
on,
the
conjugal
visit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
is
it
not...
is
not
correct
that
the...
the
transaction
term
is
broader
than
business?
there's
a
comma
between
"business"
and
"transaction"...
so
presumably
it
applies
to
any...
in
connection
with
any
business
or
any
nonbusiness
transaction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
this
is
surely
a
nonbusiness
transaction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yeah,
but
the...
but
the
transaction
has
to
have
value
of
more
than
5,000.
they
said
the
visit
was
worth
more
than
5,000,
using
market
value
in
the...
in
the
relevant
market
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wolfson,
on
justice
scalia's
example
of
opening
a
window,
it
would
have
to
be
worth
$5,000,
that...
to...
the
market
value
of
opening
a
window.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
it
was
letting
him
out
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--out
in
the
open,
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--public
park
every
thursday,
friday
and
saturday,
instead
of
staying
in
prison,
that
would
be
the
same
kind
of
transaction
as
opening
the
window,
and
it
might
be
worth
a
little
more.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
think
that
helps
you?
i
mean--
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
doesn't
say
that.
i
don't...
i
don't
read
the
1-year
period
to
impose
that
requirement.
it
just
describes...
that
just
defines
the
period
in
which
the
$10,000
or
more
has
to
be
received.
it
doesn't
say
anything
about
when
the
crime
has
to
be
committed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
is
related
to
the
time
of
the
offense?
