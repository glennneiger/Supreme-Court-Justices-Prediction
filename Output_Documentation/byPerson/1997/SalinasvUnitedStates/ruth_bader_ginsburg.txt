i'm...
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't...
i
didn't
quite
grasp
the...
the
answer
to
your
question.
is
there...
is
there
a
doubt,
is
it
disputed
that
conjugal
visits
are
unauthorized
for...
for
federal
prisoners
housed
in
this
jail?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
why
would
that
have
to
be
put
to
the
jury?
that's
a
given,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
enriquez--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--this...
this
question
puzzles
me.
i
thought
one
of
the
aims
of
rico
was
to
get
after
organized
crime,
including
the
top
people.
and
the
top
people
may
plan,
agree
to,
but
ordinarily
don't
themselves
perform
the
predicate
acts.
they
don't
engage
in
the
robberies,
the
murders
and
the
rest.
so
it...
it
would
not
seem
a...
a
logical
reading--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
say
that...
that
it
has
to
be...
that
you
have
to
agree
to
do
the
act,
instead
of
that
the
act
will
be
done.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wolfson,
maybe...
maybe...
maybe
this
would
clarify
it.
when
the
government
says
it's
a
conjugal
visit,
suppose
beltran
was
a
state
prisoner.
would
you
say
the
statute
still
applied?
because
there
is
federal
funding
to
help
on
the
construction.
there
is
federal
funding
to
house
prisoners.
this
prisoner
happens
to
be
a
state
prisoner,
but
there
is...
there
is
a
sheriff
or
an
assistant
that
is
taking
bribes.
would
the
statute,
in...
on
your
reading,
cover
this
case
if
beltran
had
been
a
state,
and
not
a
federal,
prisoner?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
transaction,
you
have
told
me,
is
the
conjugal
visit,
which
is
not...
is
not
related
to
the
federal
grant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
you...
regarding
the
transaction,
is
the
conjugal
visit--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
which
the
bribe
was
paid?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
suggesting
there's
a
tenth
amendment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
that
this
is...
that...
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
federal
government
to
say,
now,
when
we
give
our
money
to
state
operators,
we
want
that
agency,
in
all
of
its
parts,
to
be
clean,
because
if
there's
bribery
going
on
with
the
state
program,
the...
there's
the
risk
that
the
same
officers
that
are
dishonest
with
regard
to
the
state
program
are
going
to
be
dishonest
with
regard
to
the
federal
program?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what's
wrong
with
federal
money...
that
seems
to
be
a
big
federal
peg...
we're
giving
you
federal
money--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--to
make
conditions
on
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
did
you
make
that
argument
somewhere
else
along
the
line,
or
did
you
just
today?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
made
that
argument
in
the
lower
courts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
tenth
amendment
argument
that
you're
presenting
to
us
now--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
you
make
that
in
the
lower
courts?
