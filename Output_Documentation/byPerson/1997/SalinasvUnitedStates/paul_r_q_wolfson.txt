mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
statute
before
the
court,
the
bribery
offense,
which
is
stated
in
section
666,
specifies
four
elements.
first,
the
defendant
must
be
an
agent
of
an
entity
that
receives
federal
benefits.
second,
the
federal
benefits
received
by
that
entity
must
exceed
$10,000
in
a
1-year
period.
third,
during
that
1-year
period,
the
defendant
must
accept
something
of
value,
intending
to
be
influenced
in
a
transaction
of
the
entity.
and,
fourth,
the
transaction
must
involve
something
of
value.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
transaction
in
this
case
was
allowing
con...
was
allowing
conjugal
visits.
that
was
the
theory
on
which
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
jury
instruction
is
found
on
page
127
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
the
judge
says,
now...
says,
now,
what
are
the
transactions?
the
transactions
are
allowing
contact
visits,
i...
i
should
say.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
basically,
took
the
same...
the
same
view.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
if
the...
it
could
be.
i
think
that
if
the...
if
the
person
who
is
taking
the
bribe
is
a
jail
guard,
who...
you
know,
i
think
that
you
have
to
say
that.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
do
think
that
what--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
let
me
first--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--let
me
first
say,
this
is
not
a
point
that's
discussed
in
the
briefs.
but
i...
i
have
to
say--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--whatever
it...
as
a
transaction,
it
can't
be
limited
to
a
deal,
because
i
do
think
that
the
statute
does...
whatever
else
it
does
get
at...
and
i
know
that's
been
a
subject
of
disagreement...
it
does
get
at
situations
where
a...
a
recipient
of
federal
funds
just
simply
hands
out
money
to
other...
other
people,
without
something
necessarily
in
exchange...
a
kind
of
a
grant
program.
and
i
think,
in
many
cases,
in
that
situation,
the...
say,
the
government
gives
money
to
a
local
agency,
in
turn,
to
hand
out
money,
the
local
agency
won't
be
getting...
won't
be
getting
a
deal
for
it.
but
i
think,
clearly,
one
thing
that
is
within
the
statute
is
if
someone
bribes
a...
an
agent
of
a
local
agency,
you
know,
to
send...
send
the
grant
money
my
way,
rather
than
to
somebody
else.
i
think...
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that...
that's
right.
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i...
i
think
that's
right.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that...
well,
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
could
be--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
the
business
of
the
jail
could
have
been...
the
ongoing
housing
of
federal
prisoners.
but
here,
the...
i
mean,
i
think
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the...
the
case
was--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
case
was
certainly
submitted
to
the
jury
on
the
theory
that
the
transaction--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--allowing
the
conjugal
visits.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i...
i
think
it
can't
be
applied
that
way
in
this
case,
because
the...
the
statute
requires
a
payment
from
the
briber...
you
know,
intending
to
be
influenced--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i...
i
think
that
the
case...
i
think
that,
certainly,
one
could
have
tried
this
case
on
the
theory
that
the
ongoing
treatment
of
the
prisoner...
you
know,
if
the
prisoner
received
just,
generally,
day
to
day,
more
favorable
treatment
than
somebody
else,
and
gave
money
in
return
for
that,
that
that
could
have
been
a
business,
which
is
the...
the
conditions
under
which
the
prisoner
was
housed
at
the
jail.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i...
there...
i
think
there
is
an
element,
yes--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
i
think
there
is
an
element
of
exchange.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
that's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--but
i...
but
i
don't...
but
i
don't
think
that
the
payment...
i
don't
think
that
the
transaction
requires
an
exchange.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
at...
at
any
rate,
i...
i
do
want
to
point
out
that
the
issue
of
transaction
is
not
in
the
briefs.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes,
it...
it
would.
it...
it's
because
the...
the...
all
of
the
four
elements
of
the
offense
are...
are
stated
in
the
hypothetical--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
no.
the...
the
trans...
the
transaction
is...
let's
suppose
there
was
a
state--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
federal
grant--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
federal--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the
federal...
the
federal
government
is
giving...
on
the
hyp...
i...
i
hope
i'm
understanding
the
hypothetical
correctly...
the
federal
government
is
giving
the
jail
money
to
house
a
federal
prisoner.
now,
it
so
happens
that
at...
during
that
1-year
period,
there
is
a
state
prisoner
in
the
jail
cell
next
to
beltran--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--who
is
giving
bribes--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--in
return
for
the...
the
privilege
of
receiving
conjugal
visits.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
statute
clearly
does
cover
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that
situation.
because--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i...
i'm
not
aware
of
any.
but,
certainly...
certainly,
that's
the
way
in
which
the...
as
i
read
the
jury
instruction,
that's
the
way
in
which
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
and
that
hasn't
been
challenged
in
this
court,
at
any
rate.
and
the...
the
whole
point
hasn't
been
briefed
at
all.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
excuse
me?
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i...
i
think
it
could
be...
i
think
it
could
be
applied
in
that
situation.
i
don't
think
that
the
statute
covers
only
a
situation
where
congress
gives
an
entity
money
and
then
sets
that
entity
loose
in
the
world
to
engage
in...
with
that
money...
to
engage
in
a
commercial
transaction.
i
think
that
it...
it
clearly
covers...
it
clearly
covers
broader--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--excuse
me?
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
the
business...
it
could
be
said
that
the
business
of
the
justice
department
is
to...
is
to
bring
cases...
the
business
of--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
it's
the...
but
it's
the
business--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
is...
what
it
says,
it
is
the
business
or
transaction
of...
of
an...
of
an
organization,
agency
or
government.
and
it
doesn't--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
it
can.
i
think
the
business...
i
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
business...
that
business
could
be...
could
reach...
that
business
or
transaction
could
reach
different...
different
points.
i
mean,
business,
for
example,
could
reach
the
broad
programmatic...
the
broad
programmatic
purpose,
such
as,
you
know,
the...
the
general
business
of
housing
prisoners.
transaction
is
one
implementation
of
that...
of
that
business,
such
as
allowing...
allowing
a
prisoner
to
have
more
privileges
than
he
would
normally,
under
the
generally
applicable
rules.
there
are
also
situations,
i
should
say,
where
the
courts
have
held
"business"
to
cover
situations
where
one
local
agency
is
an
intergovernmental
entity,
where
it...
where
the
local
agency
doesn't
have
the
authority
to
do
something
on
its
own,
and
they've
said,
well...
and,
say,
one
entity's
representative
votes
on
an
intergovernmental
board...
and
they
say,
well,
this
is
clearly
a
business,
because
it's...
it's
engaged
in
a...
you
know,
in
a
relationship
with
another
entity.
i
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i...
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have...
i
think
if
we
had
charged...
i
think
we
might
have
charged
by
saying
that
he
offered
a
bribe
and
a
bribe
was
taken
in
connection
with
a
series
of
transactions.
but
i
don't
know
that
we
would
have
charged
in
connection
with
a
business
of
the
jail.
but,
as
i...
again,
this
has
not
been...
we...
we're
bound
by
the
theory
which
we
took
in
a
lower
court,
which
was
that
the
transaction
is
the...
is
the
conjugal...
is...
was
the
contact
visits
that
were
allowed.
because
that
was
basically
an
exercise
of
the...
of
the
authority,
or
of
the
discretion,
of
the
sheriff
and
the
deputy
sheriff
of
the
county,
who
had
the...
whose
job
it
was...
whose
official
function
it
was
to
decide
when
and
under
what
circumstances
the
door
of
the
jail
cell
would
be
allowed
open
so
that
the...
a
prisoner
could
be
allowed
to
see
his
family
or...
or
whatever.
and
that's
how
we
viewed
the...
the
transaction.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
there
are
situations
where
a
word
"business"
could
apply.
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
apply
to
the...
the
treatment...
i...
i'm
not
sure
that
it
would
apply
to
the...
to
the...
the
various
exercises
of
discretion
in
which
a
prisoner
is
treated.
but
i...
i
think
the
word
"transaction"
clearly
does
fit
it.
i...
i
guess
i...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be...
to
be
that
ambiguous.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
the...
the
question...
the
question
presented
is
clearly
whether
there
has
to
be
a
nexus
shown
to
the
treatment
of...
well,
it
says
what
kinds
of
cases
involving
state
employees
are
subject
to
prosecution
under
18
u.s.c.
666.
but
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
do
such
cases
include
cases
where
no
federal
funds
are
di...
disbursed
or
impinged.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
now,
having
said
that,
i
think
that
the
statute...
i
mean,
the
statute
clearly
covers
cases
like
this
one,
where
there
is
a
strong
federal
interest
in
the
integrity
of...
there
is
an...
there
is
an
important
federal
interest
in
cases
like
this,
where
the...
the
recipient
of
the
federal
funds
is
housing
federal
prisoners,
is
responsible
for
their
custody
and
their
safekeeping
and
is
obligated
to...
to
keep
them
under
certain
conditions,
but
also
to
keep
them
under
certain
privileges.
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--if
congress...
i
mean,
if
congress
gave
the
federal...
gave
the
states
or
local
governments
just
money
to
house
state
prisoners,
yes,
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
the
statute
does
not
require
a
nexus
to
the
implementation
of
the
federal
program.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that's
correct,
on
the
terms
of
the
statute.
i
think,
though,
that...
i
mean,
congress
could,
for
example,
give
a
local
government
a...
an
unrestricted
block
grant,
sort
of
a...
a
revenue-sharing
grant
in
aid
program.
and
i
think
that
congress
could...
under
the
spending
clause,
congress
could
have
restrictions
such
as
this
follow
the
grants
and...
the
grants
and
their
funds.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
no,
the
bribe
has
to...
the
bribe
has
to
take
place
during
the...
the
1
year...
a
1-year
period
surrounding
the...
the
receipt
of
federal
benefits.
so
it's
not...
it's
not
as
though
once
you
get
federal...
once
you
get
$10,000
of
federal
money,
you...
you're
on
the
hook
forever.
it's...
the...
the
statute
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
but
1-year
period
is
then
defined...
this
is
on
page
3a
of
our...
the
appendix
in
our
brief...
the
term,
1-year
period>
["]
means
a
continuous
period
that
commences
no
earlier
than
12
months
before
the
commission
of
the
offense
and
ends
no
later
than
12
months
after
the
commission
of
the
offense.
so...
i
mean,
it
has...
the
bribe
has
to
be
roughly
contemporaneous
with
the...
with
the
receipt
of
federal
funds.
and
the...
so,
after
the
1-year
period
is
over,
if
the
agency
doesn't
get
or
take
federal
funds--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yeah.
i
mean,
it's...
you
see,
the
statute--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--is...
is
somewhat
of
a...
of
a...
of
an
acrostic.
if
you...
if
you
look
at
section
(b)...
well,
let's...
let
me
start
with
section
(a).
whoever...
if
the
circumstance
described
in
section
(b)
exists,
then
you
have
to
look
at
(b).
and
it
says,
the
circumstance
referred
to
in
subsection
(a)
is
that
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--is
that
the
organization
received
benefits
in
any
1-year
period.
and
then
you
go
on
to
(d)(5),
and
it
says
what
the
term
1-year
period>
["]
means.
so,
although--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
that's
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
is...
i
think
that
is--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yeah.
i
think
that
is
the
reading
of
the
statute.
but
i
think
that
it...
it--
[laughter]
--the...
the...
it
operates
on
the...
it
operates
on
a
prophylactic
principle,
which
is
that...
which
is
that
congress
is
entitled
to
insist
that
any
entity
to
which
it
gives
money
be
free
of
significant
corruption.
and
even
if
the...
even
if
the
corrupt
act
takes
place
before
the
money
is
actually
in
the
hands
of
the
recipient,
it...
you
know,
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
the...
the
receipt
of
federal
funds
is
a...
is
a...
is...
was
seen
by
congress
as
a
jurisdictional...
as
a
jur...
and...
and
has
been
seen
by
the
courts
as
a
jurisdictional
requirement
that
brings
federal
authority
along
with
it.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
in
this--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
mean,
in
this
regard,
i
do
think
it
is
actually
useful
to
remember
that
the
statute
was
enacted
while
the
dikson
case
was...
while
the
dikson
case,
under
18
u.s.c.
201...
while
that
issue
was
percolating
in
the
courts.
and
there
were
many
cases
that
have
been
prosecuted
under
section
201
that
would
not
fit
a
commercial
bribery
situation,
where
the
federal
government
gave
community
organizations
grants,
and
said
to
the
community
organizations,
you
go
out
and
relieve
poverty
with
this
money.
and...
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--yes.
well,
i
do
want
to
point
out,
there
is
another...
there
is
a
limitation...
there...
there
is
a
limitation
that
is
in
the
statute,
which
is
that
the...
which
is
that
the...
there
are
two
limitations
i
do
want
to
point
out.
first
of
all,
the...
the
defendant
has
to
be
an
agent
of
a
local
organization.
and
he
has
to
be
able
to
act
on
behalf
of
the
organization.
so
it
may
not
be
that
every
single
employee
of
every
organization
is
covered.
there
is
a
level
of,
i
think,
responsibility,
official
responsibility,
that
is
covered...
captured
in
the
term
"agent".
and
the
other
point
is
that
the
statute
covers...
this
is
in
subsection
(b)...
benefits
under
a
federal
program
that
covers
a
variety
of
forms
of
federal
assistance,
and
that...
the
legislative
history
and
the
courts
have...
have...
do
point
out
that
there
are
some
purely
commercial
transactions
between
the
government
and,
say,
somebody
who
the
government
buys
computers
from,
just
without
any
kind
of
federal
programmatic
aspect.
i
mean,
if
the
government
just
goes
out
into
the
open
market
and
spends
$10,000
for
fungible
equipment,
that's
not
necessarily
ben...
that's
not
benefits
under
a
federal
program
or
form
of
federal
assistance.
there
is
a...
there
is
an
aspect
of
the
implementation
of
a
federal
policy
that
comes
with
those
words.
i
want
to
turn
at
this
point
to
the...
the
other
issue
before
the
court,
which
is
the
rico
conspiracy
issue.
our
posissue...
our
position
on
that
issue...
excuse
me...
is...
is
quite
straightforward,
which
is
that
the
rico
conspiracy
provision
follows
traditional
principles
of
conspiracy
law.
and
under
the
traditional
principles,
the
government
is
not
required
to
prove
that
the
defendant...
the
conspiracy
defendant
agreed
personally
to
commit
the
offense
that
is
the
object
of
the
conspiracy.
the
government
needs
to
prove
only
that
the
conspirators
agreed
among
themselves
that
the
offense
would
be
committed
by
one
or
more
of
them,
and
that
the
defendant
associated
himself
with
that...
with
that
agreement.
nothing
in
the
rico
conspiracy
statute
suggests
that
congress
intended
to
depart
from
this
well-settled
rule.
congress
used,
really,
a
term
of
art,
1962(d).
and
that
term
has
a
settled
common
law
meaning,
and
there
is
no
indication
in
the
statute
that
there
are
any
additional
elements
of
proof.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i...
i
think
that
may
be
right.
that
is,
let's
say
a
group
of
people
get
together
and
say,
you
know,
we
want
to
have
a...
a...
a
conspiracy
of
some
kind.
it
may
be
that
the
conspirators
must
foresee
that
a
person
carry
out...
a...
one
person
carry
out
two
predicate
acts
of
racketeering.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
and,
of
course,
two
people
could
carry
out
four
or
three
carry
out
six
or
whatever.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
i
think
that
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
no.
but
i
think
that
the...
but
what...
i
think
it
is
important
to
point
out,
as
i
think
what
justice
ginsburg's
colloquy
with
my
colleague
pointed
out,
one
thing
rico
clearly
was
intended
to
get
at
was
the...
the
person
who
sits
at
the
top
of
the
organization,
who
effectively
insulates
himself.
and
to...
to
use,
sort
of,
that
classic
example,
suppose
the...
the
middle
people
in
the
organizations
go
to
the
top...
the
organized
crime
chieftain
and
the
say,
you
know,
we
really
want
to
get
into
the
business
of
arson.
and
we...
we...
you
know,
we
have
a
plan...
you
know,
we're
going
to
start
burning
down
buildings
for...
you
know,
for...
for
hire.
and
the
head
of
the
organization
says,
you
know,
that
sounds
good,
you
know,
do
you
have
any
particular
plans
in
mind?
they
say,
no,
but,
you
know,
we
think
we've
got
it.
i
think
that,
in
that
situation,
you
know,
it
falls
squarely
within
the...
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
and
by
agreeing
to
that...
i
mean,
the...
the
chief
has
really,
you
know,
has
really
allowed
the...
allowed
the
thing
to
go
forward.
and
his
agreement
is...
is
essential,
in
that
case,
to
the...
to
the
achievement
of
the...
of
the
enterprise,
which
have
the
necessary
structure.
as
the
plan
is
presented
to
him,
there
clearly
is
a
pattern,
because
there
is
to
be
continuity,
plus
relationship.
and
the...
the...
the
requirement
is
satisfied
that
there
be
two
predicate
acts
of
racketeering.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
by
a
person.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
but...
but
i
think,
under
the...
the
rule
that
is
suggested
by
the
defendants,
really,
the...
it
would
hamper
the
government's
ability
to...
to
effectively
prosecute
racketeering.
if
there's
nothing
further,
i'd
just
like
to
close
by
saying
we...
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
