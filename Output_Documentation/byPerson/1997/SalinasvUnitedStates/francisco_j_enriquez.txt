mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
the
rico
statute
and
the
federal
theft,
bribery
and
embezzlement
statutes.
concerning
the
federal
bribery
statute,
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
whether
this
prosecution
in
federal
court,
of
state
officials,
is
within
the
scope
of
the
statute,
even
though
it
does
not...
the
conduct
complained
of
does
not
impinge
upon...
upon,
affect
or
divert
federal
or
even
state
or
even
any
local
funds
whatsoever.
concerning
the
rico
statute,
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
what
are
the
elements
of
a
rico
conspiracy
and
how
that
should
be
charged
to
a
jury.
because
of
the
nature
of
the
prosecution
in
this
case,
state
officials
being
tried
for
primarily
state
law
violations
in
federal
court,
it
raises
great
issues
concerning
federalism
and
the
federalization
of
state
crimes.
as
to
the
federal
bribery
statute,
it
is
our
position
that
the
statute
itself
does
not
reach
as
far
as
a
prosecution
in
this
case.
of
course,
the...
the
funds
which
funded
the
bribery
did
not
involve
any
state,
federal
or
local
funds;
but,
more
importantly,
no
federal
funds,
no
local
funds,
no
state
funds,
whatsoever,
were
diverted.
18
u.s.c.,
section
666
contemplates
the
kind
of
transaction
where,
for
example,
money
is
embezzled
from
the
government,
where
there
is
a
theft
of
government
property,
or,
in
the
bribery
context,
where
government
funds
are
diverted
as
a
result
of
the
bribe.
and
what
i
mean
by
this,
for
example,
is
where
money
is,
for
example,
paid
to
a
government
official,
and
then
a...
a
bid
is
awarded
or
a
contract
is
given
or
a
lease
is
awarded
or
a
grant
is
made
or
a
job
is
given,
something
of
that
nature.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
not
at
all,
your
honor.
i
am
saying
that
there...
i
do
recognize
that
there
is
a
federal
interest
in
how
the
prisoners
are
treated.
and...
and
i
think
that
could
be
vindicated
probably
in
a
properly
worded
statute
that
is
directed
to
that.
but
this
statute
is
not
directed
to
that.
additionally,
if
i
may
point
out,
the
government's
interest
is...
is
probably
satisfied
if,
for
example,
it
makes
sure
that
the
grant
that
it's
giving
or...
or
the
federal
funds
that...
that
it
is
awarding
are
to
an
organization
that,
for
example,
shares
it
views...
shares
its
views
or
its
policies.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
well,
yes,
it
would
be,
justice
rehnquist,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
would
be,
but
it's
our
position
that
the
purpose
of
this
statute
is
a
protection
of
property
statute.
that's
what
this
statute
is
directed
at.
that's
the
focus
of
it.
that
is
what
the
government
is...
is
trying
to
take
care
of.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
justice
breyer.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
right.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
well,
because
in...
in...
in
the
trial
court
level,
the
judge
faced
the
issue
of
whether
this
conduct
in
this
case,
the...
the
conjugal
visits
or
the
contact
visits,
were...
were
illegal.
and
the
jury
was
not
asked
to
find
whether
that
was
improper
conduct
in
this
situation.
and
what
they
were
asked
were
whether
bribes
were
paid
for
contact
visits.
the...
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
as
we
see
it,
is
a
protection
of
property
statute.
we
see
it
from...
from
the
internal
structure
of
the
statute.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes...
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
no...
no,
ma'am.
the...
the
judge,
in
instructing
the
jury,
said
that
the
question
of
whether
there
were
conjugal
visits
or
contact
visits...
and
that
was
disputed
in
the
evidence...
was
not
the
issue.
the
question
was,
was
their
payment
for
these
visits,
whatever
their
nature
may
have
been.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i...
i
think
it's
because
it
was
a
policy
of
the
sheriff's
department
not
to
allow
conjugal
visits.
and...
and,
of
course,
the
sheriff
indicated
that
the
visits
that
occurred
were
not
conjugal...
conjugal
visits.
although
they
were
very
liberal,
as
far
as
the
number
of
contact
visits
that
were
allowed,
he
denied
that
conjugal
visits
occurred.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
i...
i
think
there
is--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--well,
because
this
statute
is
directed
to
the
protection
of
property.
that
is
the...
the
structure
of
the
statute.
that
is
the
history
of
the
statute.
for
example,
this...
this
statute
is
not
limited
to
bribery.
it
is...
it
also
deals
with
theft
of
government
property.
it
deals
with
embezzlement
of
government
funds.
and...
and
it's
talking
about
something...
something
of
value,
something
monetary,
something
that
can
be
measured,
being
taken
away
as
a
result...
or
being
given
out...
the
government
largess
being
given
out
as
a
result
of
a
bribe
given
to
a
government
official.
that
didn't
occur--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
it
is
covered
by
that
statute,
because
then
there
is...
is
something
that
was
taken
from
the
federal
funds
or
from
the
state
funds,
but
not
the
local
funds.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
sir,
it...
it
is...
justice
kennedy,
it
is
covered
by
this
statute,
because
the
statute,
in
my
reading
of
it,
says,
not
only
are
we
protecting
federal
funds,
but
state,
we're
going
to
protect
your
funds,
we're
going
to
protect
your
property,
we're
going
to
protect
you
from
bribery.
so,
yes,
from
the
plain
reading
of
the
statute,
it
does
cover
that
situation.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
mmm-hmm.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i...
i
think
it
would
be
probably
not
covered
by
the
statute,
because
nothing
was
taken
from
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
or
the
local
government.
the...
there
was
no
taking
of
funds
from
these
entities.
and
so
i
don't
think
it
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
and
i
don't
think
this
statute
is
intended
to
cover
all
of
those
situations.
for
example,
from
the
legislative
history,
it...
and
from
the
reading
of
the
statute,
it
makes
it
clear
that
not
all
prohibited
transactions
are
covered,
even
if
the
agency
receives--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i
find
it
in...
in
the
bribery
portion
of
the
statute
that
says
that
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
violation,
there
has
to
be...
it
has
to
involve
a
transaction...
business
transaction
or
series
of
transaction
of
government,
involving
more
than
$5,000.
that
$5,000
figure
is
something
that
is
carried
through,
throughout
the
statute,
not
only
in
the
bribery
provisions,
but
also
in
the
theft
and
embezzlement
provisions.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not.
under
the
terms
of
the
statute,
the
amount
of
the
bribe
can
be
any
amount.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
it
refers
to
the
value
to
the
federal
government
or
the
state
government
or
the
local
government
of
what
was
taken
away
from
them.
similar
to
the
embezzlement
and
theft
provisions
that
say,
if...
if
money
is
taken
from
the
federal
government,
embezzled,
and
it's
$5,000,
then
it's
a
violation
under
the
statute.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i...
i
don't...
i
don't--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--i
think
that's...
that's
our
point,
your
honor,
that...
that
these--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--i...
i
wouldn't
either,
and
even--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--that's
right.
i...
i
don't
see
it
that
way,
your
honor.
we
feel,
justice
scalia,
that
the
statute
applies
when...
for
example,
more
appropriately,
let's
someone
comes
to
an
official,
who
has
the
power
to
disburse
federal
funds
or
federal
largess,
and...
and
they
pay
him
something,
and
then
he
gives
the
contract.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
a
bid.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
or
the
grant.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
or
things
of
that
nature.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i...
i
think
that's...
there's
a
possibility
of
that
reading.
but
i
think
when
you
look,
justice
o'connor,
at
the
structure
of
the
statute
that
talks
about
the
other
parts,
embezzlement
and
theft
of
property,
they're
talking
about
taking
it...
taking
it
from
the
government.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i...
i
guess
our
position,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the...
the
only
transaction
there
was
a
transaction
between
the
marshal's
office
and
the
county
of
hidalgo
to
establish
this
agreement.
and...
and
i
don't
think
that...
unless
it
be
under
some
kind
of
third-party
beneficiary
theory
or
some
other
kind
of...
of
theory,
that
that
would
bring
beltran--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--that's
right.
but
it...
it
didn't
have
anything
to
do
with,
for
example,
whether
he
should
be
in
the
jail
or
not.
that
was
something
that
was
strictly
the
marshal's...
the
u.s.
marshal's
decision.
he's
the
one
that
decides
how
many
people...
federal
prisoners...
are
going
to
be
in
that
jail
or
whether
they're
going
to
be
housed
in
that
jail
or
another
jail.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
ma'am.
and...
and,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
that...
that
that's
the
basis
for
this
particular
statute.
the
basis
for
this
statute
is
to
protect
property,
to
avoid
funds
leaving
the--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes,
your
honor--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes.
and...
and
i
think
we
also
look
at
the...
at
the
history
of
the
statute,
the
legislative
history,
because
it
is
unclear.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i
will
try.
if
i
could,
another
indication--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--that's
what...
that's
what--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--that's
what
both
courts
below
relied
on.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
sir.
but
then--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--justice
stevens,
yes.
but
then
you
would
have
a
situation
where,
within
the
bribery
context,
there's
a
portion
of
the
bribery
statute
that
says
that
the
bribe
can
be
of
any
value--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--well--
[laughter]
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--justice
stevens--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
no.
that's
correct.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
and
i
think
it--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--and--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes,
sir.
and...
and
the
statute
seems
to
be
stretching
that
definition
to
fit
this
set
of
circumstances.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
the
legislative--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes,
your
honor,
the
legislative
history--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
right.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
right.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
that...
that's
correct.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
there's
something
in
the
legislative
history
that...
that
talks
in
terms
of
bribery,
which
influences
federal
funds.
additionally,
another
indication
that
this
is
its
purpose
is
illustrated
by
reference
to
what
is,
in
essence,
what...
what
i
consider
the
com...
the
companion
statute
to
666,
which
is
18
u.s.c.,
section
201,
which
is
also
a
bribery
statute,
and
which,
it
can
be
said,
was
the
impetus
for
the
creation
of
section
666.
and
section
201
is
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history.
section
666
was
enacted
because,
in
interpreting
section
201,
many
courts
had
given
a
narrow
definition
to
agents
of
government,
or
who
was
acting
on
behalf
of
the
government,
to
come
within
the
scope
of
that
bribery
statute.
however,
this
court
interpreted
section
201,
in...
in
the
case
of
dikson
v.
united
states,
and
stated,
quote,
the
regulation
and
oversight
of
the
funds
is
aimed
precisely
at
the
harm
that
occurred
here:
diversion
of
federal
money
to
unauthorized
purposes...
diversion
of
federal
money
to
un...
unauthorized
purposes.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
that...
that
apparently
is
the
intent
of
this
statute.
i
see
it
as
a
protection
of
property
statute.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
well,
it...
it...
it
does,
your
honor,
if
we
ignore
the
structure,
i
think,
of
the
statute
in
its
entirety,
and
we
ignore
the
fact
that
concerning
the
bribery,
what
amount--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--no...
no.
additionally,
within
the
bribery...
the
bribery
provisions,
itself,
it
has
two
elements
in
there.
what
is
the
amount
of
the
bribe?
it
can
be
any
amount.
and,
then,
what
does
it
have
to
deal
with?
it
has
to
deal
with
a
transaction
involving
$5,000
or
more.
and...
and
that
is
something
that
is
carried
out
throughout
the
terms
of
the
statute,
not
only
in
this
bribery
provision,
but
in
the
theft
and
also
in
the
embezzlement
provisions.
may
it
please
the
court:
concerning
rico,
it's
our
position
that
in
order
to
be
found
guilty
of
a
rico
conspiracy,
the
government
has
to
prove
that
the
defendant
either
committed
two
predicate
acts
or
agreed
to
commit
two
predicate
acts.
we
believe
this
is
so,
first
of
all,
because
it's
a
natural
reading
of
the
rico
substantive,
which
states
that
the
essence
of
the
violation
is
to
conduct
or
participate,
through
a
pattern
of
racketeering.
that
is,
the
performance
of
two
predicate
acts.
it
doesn't
speak
in
terms
of
joining
a
conspiracy
or
simply
joining
an
enterprise.
indeed,
the
indictment
in
this
case
read
in
that
fashion.
it
alleges
that
the
defendant
conspired
to
conduct
or
participate.
it
says
nothing
about
conspired
to
join
an
enterprise.
even
the
case
law
cited
by
the
government
indicates
that
in
reading
rico
substantive
and
the
rico
conspiracy
statutes
together,
that
that's
the
natural
reading...
conspire
to
conduct
or
participate...
not
simply
to
conspire
to
join.
well,
we...
we
feel
that
this
pattern
of
racketeering
element
is
what
makes
this
rico
statute
so
unique.
this
is
the
core
of
the
statute.
and
that
conduct
or
participating
in
a
pattern
of
racketeering
is
what
brings
one
within
the
scope
of
this
statute.
and
we
feel
that
the
government
is
seeking
to
circumvent
this
core
requirement
in
the
statute.
in...
instructive
on
this
issue,
again,
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute,
where
the
principal
sponsor
of
the
bill
pointed
out
that
even
to
come
within
the
proscription
of...
of
title
ix
of
the
organized
crime
control
act,
which
is
rico,
and
which
contains
the
conspiracy
provision,
to
even
come
within
its
prohibition,
the
individual
has
to
commit
the
crimes,
the
predicate
acts.
and
if
he
doesn't
do
it,
then
he's
simply
not
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i...
i
think
it
depends--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
it...
it
varies
from
statute
to
statute,
crime
to
crime,
as
to
what
the
specific
intent
is;
and,
in
some
instances,
you
probably
do.
i
know
that
the
government
has
cited
the
pinkerton
case.
that
has
been
rejected
in
the
context
of...
of
rico.
but,
regardless,
the
argument
of
whether
you
bring--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--it
has
been
rejected
by
the
government's
own
decisions
in,
for
example,
the
neapolitan
case,
where
it
held
against
our
position,
but
they
discussed
the
idea
of
whether
pinkerton
would
apply
in
the
rico
conspiracy
context,
and
the
court...
the
court--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--it
was
the
7th
circuit,
your
honor.
and...
and,
in
addition,
in
that
discussion,
they
pointed
out
that
the
department
of
justice
manual
indicates
that
pinkerton
should
not
be
used
in
this
context.
additionally,
if
we
get
into
the...
the...
the
question
of
traditional
conspiracy
law,
which
rules
do
we
import
from
traditional
conspiracy
law
into
what
is
admittedly
a
new
and
drastic
statute?
i
think
if
we
look,
like,
for
example,
in
the
pinkerton
case,
it
talks
about
an
agree...
that
if
you...
if
the
substantive
statute
requires
an
agreement
of...
of
two
people
or
more,
then
you
can't
have
a
conspiracy
violation.
that
is
traditional
conspiracy
law.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
justice--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--justice
ginsburg,
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
that
is
a
logical
reading,
because
if
you
can't
get
them
under
rico
substantive,
how
can
you
get
them
under
rico
conspiracy?
and...
and
so
i
think,
under
rico
substantive,
this
court
has
instructed
us
that...
in
the
reves
v.
ernst
b.
young
case,
that
in
order
to
be
within
rico,
it's
not
simply
enough
to
be
somehow
associated
with
the
enterprise,
but,
rather,
you've
got
to
participate
by
management
or
control
of
the
enterprise.
and
so,
in...
in
your
hypothetical,
if
they
can't
get
you
for
rico
substantive,
then
i
think
it
may
be
fair
that
they
can't
get
you
for
rico
conspiracy.
and
as
a
practical
matter,
in
the
cases
that...
that
are
charged
below,
i...
i...
i've
never
seen
a
case
where
they
don't
charge
rico
substantive
and
rico
conspiracy
also,
anyway.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
your
honor.
but...
but
that,
again...
that
is
true...
but,
again,
that
incorporates
some
pretty
stunning
language
in
the
pinkerton
case.
the
pinkerton
case
being,
of
course,
where
someone
was
charged
with
a
conspiracy,
and
they
proved
a
conspiracy,
but
because
somebody
else
committed
a
substantive
crime,
he
was
also
charged
and
found
guilty
of
that
substantive
crime
under
the
partnership
of
crime
theory.
and...
and
that's
been
highly
criticized
and...
and
criticized
even
by
the
cases
that...
that
support
the
government's
position.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
as
i
indicated,
mr.
chief
justice,
i...
i
think
that
it
depends
on
a
crime-to-crime
basis.
i
don't
think
that,
across
the
board--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--well,
i
think
it's
a
specific
intent,
and
you
have
to
agree
that...
that
a
robbery
is
going
to
be
committed,
and
you've
got
to
do
something
in
furtherance
of
it.
drug
crimes--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--no.
i...
i
think
agree
to
commit
elements
of
the
robbery,
yes.
if
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it...
the
discussion
that
general
wolfson
engaged
in
with
this
court
concerning
rico
conspiracy,
the
great
debates
that
went
on
in
congress
concerning
the
enaction
of
this
statute,
the
legislative
history,
all
of
that
was
directed
to
rico
substantive.
rico
substantive,
itself,
is
directed
to
the
heads
of
the
enterprises,
the
people
that
manage
or
control.
ernst...
reves
v.
ernst
&
young
indicates
that...
that
that's
the
idea.
so
it...
it
just
doesn't
seem
unfair
that
if
you
can't
get
them
under
rico
substantive,
that
there's
apparently
a
great
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
that...
that
would
indicate,
well,
we...
we
can
get
them
under
rico
conspiracy.
the...
the
focus
here
is,
what
is
the
object
of
the
conspiracy?
and
the
object
of
the
conspiracy,
in...
in
our
view,
is
not
simply
to
join
an
enterprise
that...
that
operates
in
that
fashion,
but
to...
to
personally
agree
to
commit
two
specific
acts
of
racketeering.
that's
what
the
whole
discussion
in
the
legislative
history
was
about,
not
limited
rico
substantive
or
rico
conspiracy...
just
to
when
the
statute
would
or
would
not
apply.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court,
concerning
both
of
these
statutes,
section
666
and...
and
the
rico
statute,
that
there
are
certain
areas
of
government
which
historically
this
court
has
indicated
to
us,
under
the
constitution,
have
been
deemed
within
the
province,
or
primarily
within
the
province,
of
states.
for
example,
education,
domestic
relations,
state
officials
and
criminal
law.
this
case
has
two
of
those
areas:
state
officials
and
criminal
law.
and
it
has
been
established,
in
the
context
of
state
officials,
that
before
it
can
be
said
that
congress
intended
to
reach
their
conduct
or
regulate
their
conduct
or
affect
their
status
or
qualifications
of
state
officers,
it
must
be
clear
that
the
officers,
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
are
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
and
that's
the
clear
statement
rule.
unless...
under
that
rule,
unless
the
officers
are
clearly
within
the
scope
of
the
statute,
they're
not.
and
even
if
they
are
arguably--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
correct.
the
question
is,
under
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
for
example--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes,
because,
all...
all
of
a
sudden,
we
have
a
situation
here
where
congress
is
indicating
that
it
wants
to
work
upon
or...
or
affect
state
officials.
and
when
you...
when
that
happens,
then
it
becomes
an
issue
of
federalism.
and
it's,
i
feel,
to
be
determined
under
those
rules.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
ma'am,
i
do.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
i...
i
think
the
federal
government
can
do
that,
ma'am,
if...
if
it
is
couched
in
terms
of
protecting
its
property
or
if
it's
couched
in
another
jurisdictional
element,
such
as
it
affects
interstate
commerce,
or
one
of
the
jurisdictional
elements--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
and
i
understand
that...
that
the...
the
government's
position
on
this
is
that
it's
under
the
spending
clause
and
that,
by
virtue
of
spending,
they
can
go
ahead
and
regulate.
but
i...
i
think
this
goes
beyond
the
cases
that
they've
cited.
none
of
the
cases
that
they
have
cited
on
this
regulation
issue
are
criminal
law
cases.
all
of
the
cases
that
they
have
cited
speak
in
terms
of...
of
conditions
or...
or
incentives
to
the
states.
none
of
them
speak
in
terms
of...
of
something
as
coercive
as,
we're
going
to
put
your...
your
officials
in
jail.
so
i...
i
think,
when
you
get
to
that
point,
then
we
run
into
a
spending
clause
problem.
it
doesn't
seek
to
justify
itself
under
the
terms
of...
of
the
commerce
clause,
and
so
i
think
it
does
exceed
the
scope
of
the
constitution,
as
applied
in
this
case.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
no,
ma'am.
i...
i
did
make
that
argument.
the
government
has
in
fact
tried
to
justify--
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
--i...
i
don't
know
that
we
argued
it
in
terms
of
commerce
clause,
but
we
argued
it
in
terms
of
property
of
the
government;
that
this
was
a
protection
of
property
statute,
and...
and
that
it
could
be
just...
it
could
be
justified
only
on
that
basis.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
we
didn't
specifically
come
out
and
say
tenth
amendment,
your
honor.
mr.
francisco
j.
enriquez
thank
you.
