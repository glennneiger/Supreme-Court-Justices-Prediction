justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose...
suppose
the
jail
official
charged
with
purchasing
the
food
for
the
prisoners
is
taking
a...
a
bribe
and
a
kickback,
and
siphons
off
$10,000
a
month.
and,
as
a
result,
the
prisoners
get
much
worse
food.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
covered
by
this
statute?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no...
no;
these
are
state
funds.
these
are
state.
it
just
is
in
the
federal
facility.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
and
i
might
add,
on
that
very
same
point,
that
that's
the
way
i
think
your
indictment
is...
is
better
interpreted--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
now,
it
seems
to
me,
under
justice
o'connor's
question,
it's
either
one
or
the
other.
it's
either
the
federal
program
of
prisoners
or
the
conjugal
visits.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
can't
say
it
could
be
one
or
the
other,
because
the
statute
doesn't
permit
you
to
read
it
"one
way
or
the
other".
so
which
is
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
is
the
government's
position
as
to
what
the
transaction
is
in
this
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so,
then,
you're
saying
that
the
statute
can't
be
interpreted,
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
so
that
the
business
or
transaction
is
the
program
of...
of
keeping
the
prisoners?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
because
the...
because
the
transaction
is
that
there's
a
previous
federal
grant
to
the
prison?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the...
what's
the
federal
grant
transaction
that's
involved
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
justice
ginsburg's
hypothetical?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'd
like
to
get
just
one
point
clear.
are...
are
you
saying
that,
under
this
statute,
business
transaction
or
series
of
transactions
can
be,
depending
on
the
way
the
government
charges
in
the
indictment,
either
the
business
of
keeping
federal
prisoners
that
justice
breyer
asked
about
or
the
conjugal
visit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
a
very
strange
way
to
interpret
a
criminal
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
it
has
to
be
either
one
or
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i'm
just
trying
to
clarify
my...
you
could
have
charged
and...
and
convicted
the
defendants,
in
your
view,
in
this
case,
by
interpreting
"transaction"
in
either
of
these
two
ways?
you
had
the
option
to
charge,
and
you
would
prevail
on
either
interpretation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
for
the
next
30
years,
any
bribery...
if
it's
more
than
$5,000
involved...
in
conjunction
with
the
ordinary,
day-to-day
running
of
a
prison
that's
been
built
with
federal
monies,
is
under
this
statute--
