justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
saying
that--
--well,
why
isn't
the
transaction
the
housing
of
federal
prisoners
under
the
contract
with
the
government?
it's
in
connection
with
the
agreement
to
house
federal
prisoners.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we're
looking
at
(b),
somebody
who
corruptly
solicits
or
demands
for
the
demand
of
any
person...
that
could
be
for
the
benefit
of
beltran...
or
agrees
to
accept
anything
of
value
from
any
person...
and
he
agreed
to
accept
money
from
beltran...
intending
to
be
influenced
or
rewarded...
which
he
was...
in
connection
with
a
transaction
of
the
government
or
agency...
the
transaction
being
the
housing
of
federal
prisoners,
pursuant
to
the
contract.
i
mean,
i
could
read
it,
and
it
seemed
to
fit.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
isn't
that
complicated.
the
jail
agreed
to
house
the
federal
prisoners.
this
petitioner
worked
at
the
jail.
and
he
agreed
to
take
money
to
allow
contact
visits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
reason
the
government
wants
a
statute
like
this
is
to
avoid
the
unseemliness
of
giving
large
sums
of
federal
money
for
services
to
the
federal
government
that
are
being
carried
out
in
a
corrupt
fashion
by
the
entity
and
the
employees
charged
with
conducting
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
language
of
(b)
is
broader
than
that.
i
mean
(a)
talks
about
property;
(b)
doesn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
we...
we
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
convince
my
colleague,
justice
scalia,
of
that,
would
you?
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
the
title?
it
says
theft
or
bribery
concerning
programs
receiving
federal
money.
this
is
a
program
receiving
federal
money--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
it's
bribery.
it
just
fits
like
a
glove,
if
you
read
(b).
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
if
you
ignore
the
literal
language
in
the
title,
you
have
an
argument,
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
now,
at
common
law,
suppose
somebody
is
accused
of
a
conspiracy
to
commit
robbery.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
i
suppose
that
you
don't
have
to
find
that
the
defendant
agreed
to
personally
commit
the
robbery.
that's
not
the
common
law
definition
of
conspiracy.
you
just
have
to
agree
that
the
offense
will
be
committed.
the
government
doesn't
have
to
prove--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
the
defendant
intended
to
personally
do
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
was
the
transaction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
shouldn't
the
transaction
be
the
housing
of
federal
prisoners?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
that
looked
like
the
most
normal
reading
of
it.
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
most
cases,
it
would
make
a
lot
more
sense.
the
title
of
the
statute
is
theft
or
bribery
concerning
programs
receiving
federal
money.
that's
why
congress
wanted
to
enact
this.
they
don't
want
to
support
some
program
that's
being
corruptly
administered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
subsection
(b)
says
that
the
statute
applies
where
the
organization,
government
or
agency,
gets,
in
any
1-year
period--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--benefits
in
excess
of
$10,000
from
the
federal
government.
