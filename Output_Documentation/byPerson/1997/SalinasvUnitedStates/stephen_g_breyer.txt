justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
why...
why...
why
is
this
statute...
i
gather
the
government
gave
860...
or
$850,000,
and
about
915,000
a
year,
to
house
100...
100
federal
prisoners...
up
to
100.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
about
$9,000
or
$10,000
a
prisoner.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
create
a
certain
kind
of
a
room,
a
cell.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
now
that
room
or
cell
was
misused.
so
why
doesn't
it
affect
the...
exactly
the...
the
very,
very
expenditure
that
the
federal
government
made?
we'll
give
you
a
thous...
we'll
give
you
this
prisoner,
$10,000,
to
create
a
certain
kind
of
cell
that
is
to
be
used
in
a
certain
kind
of
way.
and
now,
this...
your
client
took
a
bribe
to
use
it
in
a
different
way.
so
why
does
that
not
directly
affect
the
federal
expenditure
that
was
at
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
would
there
have
been
a
need
for
the
briber
to
bribe
if
the
conjugal
visits
were
lawful?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
the
federal
government
gives
money
for
a
museum
or
for
a
dam,
and
a
state
official
improperly
says
to
the
public,
i'll
charge
you
to
use
the
dam,
and
keeps
the
money.
or,
i'll
only
let
you
use
the
dam
if
you
bribe
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
covered
by
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
seems
to
be
stretching
it.
well,
what
does...
what
does
the
legislative
history
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
and
specifically
on
the
point
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
you're
reading...
as
you
are
reading
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
like
a
commercial
bribery
statute.
and
that's
it.
when
they
have
a
transaction
in
the
government...
they're
awarding
contracts
or
whatever
it
is...
that's
what
you
look
to.
the
opposite
in
that
will
immunize--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
misuse
of
government
property?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
if
what
we're
after
is
a
bribe
to
obtain
misuse
of
government
property,
this
doesn't
count,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
now,
there's
something
in
the
legislative
history
that's
going
to
support
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
it
help
to
focus
on
business?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
the
statute
is
primarily
aimed
at
commercial
bribery...
that's
the
normal
situation...
they're
selling
something
or
they're
buying
something,
and
that's
the
transaction
with
the
government,
that's
the
heart
of
the
statute...
you
want
to
apply
it,
as
well,
to
misuse
of
government
property,
let's
say,
that
was
bought
by
the
government...
the
federal
government...
and
why
doesn't
the
word
"business",
then,
come
into
play?
i
mean,
there
is
no
transaction
here,
but
this
is
bribery
in
connection
with
the
business
of
this
organization,
which
is
to
house
prisoners.
and,
moreover,
it
affects...
that
word,
in
connection
with,
is
very
loose...
it
affects
that
business...
or
$5,000,
or
more,
worth
of
that
business...
because
it's
misuse
of
that
property
for
a
period
of
a
year,
and
the
single
cell
cost
10,000
for
the
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
your
response
to
justice
kennedy's...
at
the
end,
he
said,
i
think,
if
business...
the
word
"business"
fits
pretty
uneasily
here,
and
the
word
"transaction"
also
fits
pretty
uneasily.
and
it's
a
criminal
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
there
is
a
simpler
way
that's
consistent
with
the
words
"business
transaction".
the
federal
government
gives
almost
everyone
in...
you
know,
not
almost
everyone,
but
an
awful
lot
of
people
money.
and
many
of
them
are
businesses
or,
many
that
aren't
businesses,
buy
things
and
sell
things
with
the
money.
and
they
may,
even
before
they
get
the
money,
make
contracts
that
have
to
do
with
the
money
they're
going
to
get.
and
commercial
bribery
often
involves
bribing
a
selling
agent
or
a
purchasing
agent
in
respect
to
such
money
and
the
use
thereof.
and
that
would
be
a
natural
reading
of
the
words.
we
wouldn't
have
to
struggle
with
business
transaction,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
not
read
it
as
a
commercial
bribery
statute,
basically,
which
those
words,
"business
transaction",
et
cetera,
seem
to
suggest?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
i
would;
i
just
point
that
out.
