justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
don't
tie
it
into
the
text
of
this
provision,
mr.
enriquez;
that...
that...
that's
what
troubles
me.
why
not...
i...
i
find
it
difficult
to...
to
see
that
there's
any
business
transaction
or
series
of
transactions
involved
here.
what...
what
is
the
business?
you...
you...
or
you've
conceded
that
point,
haven't
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--there's
no
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
didn't
put
it
that
way
in
your
brief.
i...
i
wish
you
had
focused
on
the...
on
the
text,
"in
connection
with
any
business
transaction
or
series
of
transactions.
"
that
does
seem
to...
to
call
to
mind
that
there
have
been
a
deal.
transaction
doesn't...
i
wouldn't
call
assigning
someone
to
a
cell
a
transaction--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
a
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
gives
the
contract
or
he
gives--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
gives
the
business--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
the
grant
or
whatever,
yeah.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
enriquez,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
would
call
allowing
somebody
a
conjugal
visit
in
exchange
for
a
bribe
a
transaction.
but
that's
not
what
they
said
was
the
transaction
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
they
called
a
transaction
was
allowing
the
conjugal
visit.
and
that
does
not
seem
to
me
a
common
way
in
which
to
use
the
word
"transaction".
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
"transaction"
usually
mean
a
deal
between
two
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
transaction?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can...
you
can--
--the
reason
you
have
to
be
a
manager
is...
is
because
the
statute
requires
that
you
participate
directly
or
indirectly
in
the
conduct
of
such
enterprise's
affairs.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
the
word
"conduct"
that...
that
brings
in
that
requirement,
not...
not
any...
any...
any
implication
that
you're
not
liable
for
the
acts
of
coconspirators.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
took
a
bribe
for...
for
allowing
the
prisoner
to
open
his
window,
would...
would
opening
the
window
be
a
transaction?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
i
think
you're
using
"transaction"
in...
in
a...
in
a
broad
sense
that
i
really
don't
recognize.
i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
word
really
has,
to
me,
a...
a,
you
know,
a
flavor
of
a
deal
between
two
people--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
"business"
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
--the...
the...
the
notion
that
we
have
to
place
a
dollar
value
on
such
things
as
opening
a
window
or
having
a
visit
from...
from
your
wife--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
mean,
i...
i
can
place
$5,000
on
most
business
transactions.
i...
i
can
place
a
monetary
limit
on
it.
but...
but
the
interpretation
you're
giving
the
statute
makes
you
say,
how
much
is
it
worth
to
open
a
window?
that's
ridiculous.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--people
don't
write
statutes
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
$5,000
has...
has
to
be
given
in
connection
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
by
"in
connection
with",
i
assume...
don't
you
take
that
to
mean
in
payment
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
otherwise,
the
statute
has
a
wild
breadth
to
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
exchange.
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
he's
not
exchanging
$5,000
for
the
whole
business
of
the
prison--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
housing
federal
prisoners.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
exchanging
it
for
the
window...
for
the
opening
of
the
window
or
for
the
conjugal
visit.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
criminal
statute--
--do
you
consider
the
justice
department
a
business,
mr.
wolfson?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
consider
the
justice
department
a
business?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
could
be
said
analogously,
i
think--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
i
wouldn't...
that
wouldn't
be
the
normal
use
of
"business".
i
don't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--regard
federal
agencies
as
being
in
business.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
none...
none
of
this
leads
you
to
the
precise
thing
that
the
petitioner
here
is
complaining
of,
which
is
the
fact
that
there
is
no
federal
money
directly
involved.
none
of
this
really
goes
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
it's
a
business
or
a
transaction
or
not
a
transaction.
it
doesn't
speak
to
the
question
of
whether
you
have
to
re...
and...
and
how...
how
is
the
question
presented,
again?
justice
antonin
scalia
before
the
commission
of
the
offense.
oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
i
read
it
correctly,
you...
you...
you
can
take
a
bribe,
and
if
you're
unfortunate
enough
that
the
prison
you
take
the
bribe
from,
later,
within
less
than
1
year
after
you
commit
the
offense,
gets
federal
money,
they
got
you
under
the
statute;
is
that
right?
you...
you
are
retroactively--
justice
antonin
scalia
--sucked
into
the
vortex
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
perfectly
reasonable
from
congress'
point
of
view,
you
know.
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
still
reasonable
from
the
poor
defendant's
point
of
view.
he...
he
thinks
he's
stealing
the
money
from...
from...
from
an
agency
that
hasn't
gotten
any
federal
aid.
and,
all
of
a
sudden,
within
a
year,
it
gets
federal
aid.
that
doesn't
seem
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
of
another
statute
which
requires,
you
know,
multiple
acts
by
the
same
person.
i
mean,
it
can
be
argued
that
you
cannot
conspire
to
violate
(c)
unless
you
conspire
to
have
a
person...
it
may
not...
it
may
not
be
the
person
you're
prosecuting.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
have
to
conspire
to
have
one
particular
person
commit
a
pattern
of...
of
racketeering
activity.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
the
argument
here,
though?
justice
antonin
scalia
by
a
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
a
person.
