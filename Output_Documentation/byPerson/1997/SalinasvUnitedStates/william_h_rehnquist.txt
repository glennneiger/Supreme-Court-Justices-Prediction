we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
96-738,
mario
salinas
v.
united
states.
mr.
enriquez.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
our...
our
inquiry,
really...
we
think
probably
that
congress
is
the
one
to
decide
whether
the
government's
interest
is
satisfied.
so
i
don't
think
there's
any
separate
inquiry.
if...
if
the
statute
covers
this,
then
the
government's
interests
would
be
satisfied
by
an
application
of
the
statute,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that...
that...
that's
a
bit
tautological
to
say
that
not
all
prohibited
transactions
are
covered.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where...
where
in
the
statute
do
you
find
the
language
that
would
make
it
not
applicable,
say,
to
justice
breyer's
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
the
amount
of
the
bribe
would
have
to
be
$5,000?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
what
does
the
$5,000
refer
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
it
says
it's
aimed
precisely,
that
doesn't
mean
it's
only
aimed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who...
who...
who
has
rejected
it
in
the
context
of
rico?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
court
was...
was
the
neapolitan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
government
doesn't
need
that
part
of
the
pinkerton
case
here.
it
seems
to
me
it
just
needs
what...
what
you
apparently
agree
with
the
common
law
idea.
that
if
you
agree
that
a
robbery
should
be
committed,
the
agreement
doesn't
have
to
provide
for
you
personally
com...
committing
the
robbery.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
robbery?
take
that
for
a
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
are...
are
you...
are
you
saying
that
you
would
have
to
personally
commit
the
robbery
in
a
situation
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
enriquez.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
objection
at
the
trial
court
to
the
charge
on
what
trans...
what
"transaction"
meant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what...
what
if...
what
if
congress
had
simply
provided
for
grants
to
allow
the
state
prisons,
without
requiring
that
the
house
state
prisoners.
now,
would
this
statute
still
apply?
with...
with
federal
prisoners.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
would
still
apply.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nor
does
it
require
any
special
federal
interest.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
different
ideas
of
how
to
do
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wolfson.
mr.
enriquez,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr....
mr.
enriquez,
the
statute
here
says,
whoever
being
an
agent
of
a
state,
local
or
indian
tribe,
so
there's
no
doubt
that
congress
meant
to
include
those...
those
persons,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
we
must
read
each
clause
in
the
act
with...
with
that
in
mind,
even
though
it
was
clear
that
congress
intended
to
include
state
officials?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
enriquez.
the
case
is
submitted.
