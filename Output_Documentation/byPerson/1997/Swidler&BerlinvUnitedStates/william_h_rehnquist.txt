we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
97-1192,
swidler
&
berlin
and
james
hamilton
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
hamilton.
chief

william

rehnquist
but
that
came
at
the
initiative
of
the
attorneys,
did
it
not?
i
mean,
if
they
had...
they
had
this
confidence
that
had
been
made
to
them,
but
the
defendant
never
would
have
found
out
about
it
had
it
not
been
for
the
attorneys
for
the
other
client.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
typical
defendant
in
a
criminal
case
is
simply...
in
a
lot
of...
they're
simply
not
going
to
know
of
the
existence
of
this
evidence,
so...
if
the
privilege
obtains,
and
that
presumably
is...
if
the
privilege
does
obtain,
that's
the
way
it
ought
to
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
many
lawyers
are
kind
of
family
confidantes,
as
well
as
just
advisors
on
purely
legal
matters,
i
suspect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
person
may...
might
go
to
a
lawyer
and...
with
respect
to
your...
the
drug,
criminal
drug
problems
of
the
son
and
say,
you
know,
i
really
don't
know
what
to
do
about
it.
he
wouldn't
necessarily
have
in
mind
a
particular
testamentary
disposition.
he
probably
wants
the
lawyer
to
tell
him
what
he
might
do
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
hamilton.
mr.
kavanaugh,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
who
are
mueller
&
kirkpatrick?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kavanaugh,
you're
confining
your
argument
to
the...
to
a
criminal
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
when
you
say
a
criminal
case,
do
you
mean
a
case
where
the
statement
made
by
the
client
to
the
attorney
has
perhaps
some
earmarks
of
a
declaration
against
penal
interest,
or
is
it
just
any
statement
made
by
the
client
towards
the
attorney
which
might
be
admissible
or
useful
to
a
criminal
investigation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
that
perhaps
understates
the...
one
reason
which
i
think
is
generally
agreed
to,
that
the
client
must
feel
free
to
tell
the
lawyer,
you
know,
the
truth,
the
whole
truth,
et
cetera,
so
that
the
lawyer
will
be
able
to
give
him
good
legal
advice,
and
it
seems
to
me
when
you
narrow
the
rationale
the
way
you
do,
perhaps
you
overlook
some
of
that.
chief

william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
page
11a
are
you
reading
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
have
to
make
a
substantial
showing
under
the
rule,
don't
you,
and
for
those
perhaps
under
upjohn
you
have
to
make
even
more
of
a
showing.
what
showing
did
you
make
in
this
case
as
to
the
work
product?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
itself
is
a
substantial
showing
that
the
witness
is
no
longer
available?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
another
thing
it
shows
is
the
woeful
dearth
of
any
empirical
research
in
the
legal
profession,
because
the
kind
of
questions
that
justice
breyer
and
some
of
the
rest
of
us
asked,
you
know,
if
lawyers
were
polled
as
to
how
they
treated
client
confidences,
and
people
asked
prosecutors,
we
would
have
a
much
better
idea
of
how
to
decide
this
case
than,
you
know,
ab
writes
a
law
review
article
and
says,
here's
what
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kavanaugh.
mr.
hamilton,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hamilton.
the
case
is
submitted.
