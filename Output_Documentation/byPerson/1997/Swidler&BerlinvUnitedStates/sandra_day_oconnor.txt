mr.
hamilton,
you
take
the
position
that
there
can
be
no
compelled
testimony
by
someone
in
your
circumstances
even
if
the
information
would
be
essential
to
show
that
a
third
person
was
not
guilty
of
a
crime,
such
as
in
the
macumber
case
in
arizona.
you
say
even
in
those
circumstances
there's
no
way
to
get
at
the
information.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we
don't
even
know
that
unless
the
material
can
be
reviewed,
do
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
don't
oppose
reviewing
it
if
a
defendant
in
some
other
case
needs
the
information,
or
says
he
needs
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
kavanaugh,
that
position
is
not
really
supported
by
much
of
any
case
law
that
i
can
find.
i
mean,
that's
a
position
they
take
in
the
explanation,
but
it
does
not
appear
to
have
a
lot
of
support.
and
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
how
do
you
characterize
the
holding
of
the
majority
of
the
panel
below
that
we're
reviewing?
they
seem
to
adopt
some
sort
of
balancing
test
as
applied
to
a
specific
case
to
see
whether
testimony
should
be...
whether
the
privilege
should
be
breached
and
the
testimony
compelled.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
how
you
understand
the
holding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
seemed
to
be
some
kind
of
a
balancing
test
applied
case
by
case.
do
you
support
that
approach?
is
that
the
rule
you
suggest
that
we
should
apply?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
think
it
is.
this
court
has
rejected
a
sort
of
balancing
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.--
--well,
it
sounds
like
you're
not
arguing
for
affirmance
of
the
test
articulated
by
the
panel
below,
but
you
didn't
cross-petition.
