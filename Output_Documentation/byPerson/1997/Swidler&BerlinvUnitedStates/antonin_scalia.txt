scalia
it's
an
exception
that
pretty
much
swallows
up
the
rule
though,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
like
95
percent
of
the
cases
involve
the
exception
to
the
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
specific,
but
it
also
happens
to
be
the
situation
that
is
most
likely
to
arise
with
respect
to
privilege
as
to
a
decedent.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
precisely
the
situation
most
likely
to
arise.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
many
cases
upholding
the
privilege
uphold
it,
uphold
it
against
either
a
demand
by
a
prosecutor
in
the...
in
a
criminal
case,
or
a
grand
jury
request?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
hamilton--
--well,
unless
only
the
holder
can
assert
it.
is
it
clear
under
california
law
that
someone
other
than
the
holder
of
the
privilege
can
assert
the
privilege?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no,
that's--
--so
you
could
not
assert
it
under
california
law,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
make
an
exception
for
criminal
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
goes
your
absolute
rule
that
you
can't
draw
a
distinction
between
civil
and
criminal.
you're
willing
to
make
a
distinction
between
criminal
to
that
extent.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
still
a
criminal
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
put
it
in
the
context,
why
just
the
defendant's
rights?
i
mean,
let's
put
it
in
the
context
of
your
client
and,
as
you
know,
there
are
conspiracy
theorists
who
believe
that
his
death
was
not
a
suicide
but
in
fact
was
murder.
you
acknowledge
that
if
his
evidence
was
necessary
to
prove
that
it
was
not
his
wife
who
committed
the
murder,
that
that
indeed
might
be
able
to
come
in,
but
what
if
his
evidence
was
necessary
to
prove
that
somebody
else
committed
the
murder?
then
you
would
not
let
it
come
in
for
that
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
it
was
necessary
to
show
who
killed
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
seems
to
me
quite
disproportionate.
i
mean,
courts
like
to
get
to
the
truth,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
in
that
situation
i
can't
see
what
interest
is
being
preserved.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
virtually
all
the
other
privileges
we
have
have
somebody
else
around
who
can
say,
well,
in
this
circumstance
i'm
going
to
let
it
go.
the
attorney-client
privilege,
when
the
client
is
still
alive
he
can
say,
okay,
you
know,
in
the
interests
of
justice
this
ought
to
come
out.
but
what's
extraordinary
here
is,
you're
saying
there
is
nobody...
no
matter
how
severe
the
public
interest
is
on
the
other
side,
there
is
nobody
who
can
say,
enough
is
enough,
in
these
circumstances
the
information
ought
to
come
out.
even
if
you
yourself
thought
that
the
information
was
really
crucial
to
you,
you
would
have
to
say,
nobody
can
let
it
out.
that's
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
california
by
virtue
of
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
a
few
other
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
virtute
of
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
by
virtue
of
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
consult
you
about
somebody
else's
criminal
problem,
is
that
privileged?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
asking,
you
know,
can
my
son
be
prosecuted.
i
mean,
there's
nothing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or,
can
my
brother
be
prosecuted.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
my
third
cousin
be
prosecuted?
would
that
be--
--what
if
he's
asking,
should
i
make
an
insurance
claim
on
behalf
of
my
son,
who
has
this
problem?
he
might
not
necessarily
be
asking
about
whether
the
man
committed
a
crime,
but
whether
it
would
be
wise
to
make
a
claim
knowing
these
background
facts.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
things,
other
than
crimes,
that
lawyers
consult...
are
consulted
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
the
assumption...
no,
please.
why
do
you
accept
the
qualification
that
your
argument
only
goes
to
when
there's
an
admission
to
a
crime?
wouldn't
your
argument
also
go
to
the
situation
where
there's
an
admission
that
somebody
else
did
the
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
son
did
the
crime.
my
third
cousin
did
the
crime.
wouldn't
that
also
open
up,
if
you
accept
the
qualification,
the
consultation
to
intrusion?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
judgment
below?
was
it
that
the
district
court
consider
the
matter
and
come
to
a
determination,
or
was
it
that
the
material
had
to
be
provided?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
did
it
tell
the
district
court
to
apply
the
weighing
test
that
it
enunciated?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
wouldn't
one
think
that
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion
would
be
to
apply
the
weighing
test
that
the
court
announced?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
not
it
perhaps
shows
that
criminal
prosecutions
are
very
responsible,
that
criminal
prosecutors
are
very
responsible
and
don't
abuse
the
privilege
that
california
apparently
gives
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
it
a
problem?
i
mean,
death
has
sort
of
given
one
of
the
five
defendants
absolute
immunity--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
the
state
could
have
given
anyway,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
given
in
a
more
extreme
fashion,
so
to
speak.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
these
cases
usually
come
up
in
the
context
where
somebody
would
want
to
use...
where
insight
into
the
lawyer's
thinking
would
be
useful
in
litigation
against
the
lawyer's
client?
i
mean,
is
it...
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
work
product
privilege?
is
it
some
copyright
benefit
that
the
lawyer
has
in
the
particular,
unusual
way
that
his
lawyer's
mind
works--
[laughter]
--even
in
future
cases
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
client,
or
with
this
litigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
so
that
your
opponent
can't
see
behind
your
thinking,
your
strategizing
in
this
particular
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
when
the
case
is
all
gone,
when
there's
no
case
left
at
all,
is
there
something
sacrosanct
about
the
way
this
lawyer's
mind
was
working--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
a
long
gone
case
that
has
no
future
implications?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
sort
of
a
copyright.
it's
an
intellectual
property
thing,
right?
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
that
interest
that
he
has
to
protect?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
there's...
this
litigation
is
all
gone,
it's
not
usable
in
any
other
litigation,
what
is
the
interest
that
the
lawyer
has
to
protect?
