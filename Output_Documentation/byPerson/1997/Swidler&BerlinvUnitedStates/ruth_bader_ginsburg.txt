justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
judge
williams
did
say
further,
in
some
states
the
privilege
does
not
survive
the
winding
up
of
an
estate,
and
cited
california
for
that
proposition.
i
know
it
isn't
part
of
this
record,
mr.
hamilton,
but
is
the
foster
estate
wound
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
doctor-patient
privilege
different
in
that
respect,
on
death?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you--
--is
there
authority
for
either
of
those
propositions,
that
the
personal
representative
of
the
estate
could
waive
either
the
physician-patient
privilege
or
the
lawyer-client
privilege,
or
is
this
just
kind
of
speculation
on
your
part?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
hamilton,
you
said
you
had
five
points,
and
you
got
out
four,
so
we'd
like
to
hear
what
the
fifth
one
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kavanaugh,
we've
been
just
told
by
mr.
hamilton
that
he
wouldn't
take
it
to
that
extreme,
where
it's
a
question
of
a
defendant
who
was
convicted...
who's
charged
with
a
crime,
and
the
information
was
that
some
other
person
had
done
that
and
the
lawyer
knew
that.
he
did
not
press
his
case
to
that
extreme,
so
i
think
it
would
be
useful
if
you
curtailed
your
argument
to
the
one
that
mr.
hamilton
is
making
on
behalf
of
the
privilege.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where...
can
you
point
out
the
portion
of
the
opinion,
because
that's
blurry
in
my
mind.
i
don't
remember
the
court
of
appeals
having
resolved
the
issue
for
the
district
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
does
it
say
after
that?
it
says,
the
district
court
should,
in
its
sound
discretion,
examine
the
communications
to
see
whether
they
in
fact
do.
that's
hardly
instructing
the
district
court,
go
ahead
and
order
the
disclosure
of
this
material.
it
says,
examine
the
communications.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
the
court
goes
on
to
say,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
finds
an
interest
in
confidentiality...
the
district
court...
it
can
take
steps
to
limit
access,
et
cetera,
so
it's
hardly
an
instruction
to
the
district
court
to
go
ahead
and
order
the
divulgence
of
these
notes.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
in
that
line.
could
you,
if
foster
were
alive,
say...
subpoena
him
as
a
witness
before
the
grand
jury
and
say,
tell
us
what
you
told
your
lawyer?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
would
not
have
been
entitled
to
these
notes
if
the
client
were
alive,
so
it's
his
death
that
establishes
your
qualification
for
something
you
could
not
have
gotten.
i
thought
your
main
argument
was,
this
is
a
backup
for
the
client,
we
could
have
had
the
client
were
he
only
alive,
but
now
what
you're
really
urging
is
something
you
never
could
have
gotten
when
the
client
was
alive.
you
could
have
gotten
the
client's
testimony.
do
you
think
you
could
ask
the
lawyer,
tell
us
what
foster
told
you,
instead
of
looking
for
his
notes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no.
foster--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
you're
saying--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
have
a
right
to
his
notes.
do
you
also
have
a
right
to
the
lawyer's
testimony?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
is
it
up
to
you
interchangeably,
or
do
you
have
to
do
one
before
the
other?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how--
--but
even
on
the
work
product
side
of
it,
if
you
have
access
to
the
lawyer's
testimony,
why
do
you
need
the
notes?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
he
can
use
them
to
refresh
his
recollection.
but
i
thought,
now
turning
to
the
work
product
side
of
it,
that
a
statement
that's
not
the
witness'
verbatim
statement,
that
is
the
most
closely
guarded
kind
of
work
product,
a
lawyer's
notes
as
distinguished
from
his
verbatim
transcript
of
the
witness'
testimony.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
not
urging
that
the
law
be
what
the
d.c.
circuit...
as
i
understand
your
position,
you
say,
we
think
that
death
ends
it,
period.
the
d.c.
circuit
said
there's
some
kind
of
balancing.
do
i
understand
you
correctly
to
say,
we
think
the
d.c.
circuit
was
wrong,
but
we'll
take
that
as
second
best,
so
that
your
position
is,
death
ends
the
privilege?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
is
your
first
position,
then?
is
your
first
position
is,
death
ends
it,
or
is
it...
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
is
that
the
ali
standard?
i
think
earlier
you
said
the
ali
agrees
with
you.
i
thought
the
ali
position
was,
there's
some
kind
of
balance.
how--
