mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
light
of
what
petitioner
has
stated,
let
me
state
at
the
outset
there
can
be
no
mistake
about
the
pernicious
consequences
of
petitioner's
theory,
taken
to
its
logical
extreme.
by
permanently
walling
off
a
critical
category
of
evidence
from
the
criminal
process,
petitioners'
theory
will
lead
to
extreme
injustice.
not
our
words,
the
words
of
mueller
&
kirkpatrick.
that
will
mean
that
innocent
people--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--they
are
two
commentators
on
the
law
of
evidence.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that
will
mean
that--
[laughter]
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that
will
mean
that
innocent
people
will
be
wrongly
convicted
and
guilty
people
will
be
wrongly
exonerated,
each
of
which
implicates
a
substantial
societal
interest.
the
case
of
state
v.
macumber
is
exemplary
of
that
point.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
if
that's
true
that
he's
not
pressing
it
to
the
logical
extreme,
that
undercuts
entirely
his
chilling
effect
argument,
because
the
person
consulting
his
attorney
before
death
will
not
have
the
expectation
of
confidentiality
on
which
their
entire
theory
is
premised.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that's
right,
justice
stevens,
but
the
most
likely
issue
about
which
a
client
might
consult
an
attorney
in
which
the
communications
might
be
sought
after
death
are
testamentary
cases,
and
in
that
circumstance
the
law
has
long
established...
over
a
century
in
this
court...
that
the
privilege
does
not
survive
death,
notwithstanding,
notwithstanding
the
embarrassment
and
the
harm
to
reputation
that
can
ensue
from
disclosure--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
in
that--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that's
right.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
but
most
likely
consultation,
again,
will
be
in
the
testamentary
context,
and
there
the
law
has
long
established
that
the
privilege--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--the
most
likely
situation
in
which
the
communications
would
be
sought
after
death,
experience
tells
us,
are
testamentary
cases.
in
fact,
it
is--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--we
don't
know--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--exceptions
from
the
general
rule
of
attorney-client
privilege.
it's
not
exceptions
from
a
general
rule
about
what
happens
to
the
privilege
after
death,
the
most
prevalent
rule
after
death.
the
only
thing
we
know
that
is
settled
with
respect
to
posthumous
privilege
is
that
the
privilege
does
not
apply
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
in
which
it's
raised,
namely,
testamentary
cases.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
two
points
in
response,
justice
souter.
first,
as
judge
williams
and
judge
wald
stated
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
that
rationale
for
the
testamentary
exception
simply
does
not
work.
we
don't
know
whether,
in
intending
for
a
particular
property
distribution,
the
testator
intended
that
his
or
her
attorney-client
communications
also
be
disclosed
to
fulfill
that
property
intent,
so--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
it
may
be
reasonable
to
suppose
but
most
believe
that
that's
the
one
situation
above
all
others
where
clients
would
be
chilled
to
nondisclosure
by
the
possibility
of
posthumous
disclosure
of
the
attorney-client
communications,
and
if
we're
going
to
presume
intent
in
that
context,
why
do
we
not
also
presume
intent
in
this
context:
presume
that
a
person
near
death
would
want
to
fulfill
what
this
court
has
called
his
basic
obligation
as
a
citizen
to
provide
information
to
the
grand
jury?
and
even
on
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
it's
again
what
we
should
presume
someone's
intent
to
be,
and
if
we
presume
it
in
the
testamentary
context,
even
though
it's
going
to
be
embarrassing
information
about
one's
family
members,
it
could
cause
great
harm--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
again,
i
guess
we
just
have
a
disagreement
about
what
people
would
want
done
in
the
testamentary
context
as
well,
but--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--this
court
has
stated
repeatedly
that
privileges
obstruct
the
search
for
truth
and
thus
must
be
strictly
construed,
so
to
the
extent
there's
a
burden
with
respect
to
a
legal
issue,
we
would
suppose
that
the
burden
would
be
on
petitioners
to
establish
what
they
want
here,
which
is--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
in
the...
the
testamentary
exception
did
not
exist
forever,
either.
that
was
an
exception
that
was
developed
over
time,
and
this
court
recognized
it
in
glover
v.
patten.
with
respect
to
exceptions
to
an
absolute
privilege,
we
stili
think,
when
the
societal
interests
are
balanced,
the
burden
is
on
the
privilege
proponent
to
establish
that
the
need
for
confidentiality
outweighs
the
need
for
relevant
information.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
it's
the
latter,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
the
rule
we
seek
in
this
case
leaves
open
one
of
two
possibilities
in
a
civil
case
in
which
the
estate
is
a
party.
either
in
that
future
case
the
court
or
the
federal
courts
could
end
the
privilege
at
death,
or
they
could
end
it
when
the
estate
is
wound
up.
in
your
earlier
questions,
justice
kennedy,
about
the
estate
being
wound
up,
that
rule
shows
that
the
rationale
behind
winding
it
up
on
the
estate,
ending
the
privilege
when
the
estate
winds
up,
means
that
interests
and
reputation,
and
interests
and
protecting
others,
are
not
what
justifies
the
privilege
after
death.
it
is
simply
to
protect
the
financial
interests
of
the
estate
and,
thus,
those
codes
which
have
been
in
the
proposed
federal
rule
and
the
model
code
of
evidence,
the
rationale
for
those
codes,
limitation
and
duration
and
scope,
support
our
position
when
that
rationale
is
translated
to
the
criminal--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
we
think
the
attorney-client
privilege,
as
it
is
developed
over
time,
represents
not
a
single
policy.
petitioners
cherry-pick
out
the
one
policy
of
encouraging
client
candor,
but
it
represents
a
balancing,
a
mix
of
considerations
and
policies
that
have
led
to
different
rules
in
different
contexts,
such
as
the
crime-fraud
exception,
such
as
the
exception
for
testamentary
cases.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
the
american
law
institute,
which
does
represent
the
interest
of
judges
and
lawyers,
and
has
been
followed
by
this
court
in
many
different
bodies
of
law,
has
concluded,
in
agreement
with
our
position,
that
the
privilege
should
end
after
death.
in
the
hypothetical--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--the--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--the
court
of
appeals
did
require
that
the
information
be,
quote,
of
relative
importance,
a
standard
that
they
said
was
plainly
met
in
this
case.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
we
support
that
approach,
but
we
also
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
it
may
be
somewhat
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
has
done
in
cases
such
as
branzburg,
where--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--in
many
cases
it
has,
and
that's
why
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
that
in
cases
such
as
branzburg
and
university
of
pennsylvania
within
the
context
of
grand
jury
proceedings
the
need
has
already
been
established.
there's
no
necessity
for
further
balancing
once
you're
within
that
narrow,
limited
context.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
we're
arguing
for
affirmance
of
the
judgment
and
we
pointed
out
an
alternative
legal
standard
in
support
of
the
judgment
below.
we
are
not
seeking
to
enlarge
the
judgment
in
any
way,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
it
reversed
and
remanded
without
specific
directions
as
to
what
was
going
to
happen
on
remand.
presumably...
we
don't
know
whether
all
the
notes
even
concern
the
travel
office
matter,
since
we
haven't
seen
the
notes,
and
there
may
be
parts
of
it
that
aren't
even
relevant
to
our
investigation.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
it
simply
said,
reversed
and
remanded
for
further
proceedings
consistent
with
this
opinion,
so--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--we
don't
think
so,
because
the
court
said
the
standard
was
plainly
met
here,
and
it
was
talking
about--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--on
page
11a
of
the
petition
appendix,
where
the
proponent
has
offered
facts
supporting
a--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--the
beginning
of
the
first
full
paragraph,
where
the
proponent
has
offered
facts
supporting
a
good
faith
reasonable
belief
that
the
materials
may
qualify
for
the
exception,
a
standard
plainly
met
here
by
the
independent
counsel,
and
the
preceding
paragraph--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
we
think
the
communications
have
to
be
examined
to
determine
whether
they're
relevant
to
our
investigation.
there
may
be
portions
of
the
notes,
again,
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
travel
office
and
may
be
extraneous
materials,
and
that's
why
the
district
court
in
the
first
instance
has
to
look
at
it.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
no.
we
could
say,
tell
us
everything
you
know
about
the
travel
office
matter,
which
is
the
same
information
that
he
told...
presumably
told
mr.
hamilton.
all
we
seek
in
this
case...
the
grand
jury
seeks
no
windfall.
it
seeks
to
be...
the
same
information
to
which
it
would
have
been
entitled
were
mr.
foster
alive.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
if
he
were
alive?
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
in
the
current
situation?
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
yes.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
absolutely,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
the
orderly
process
of
a
grand
jury,
you
usually
seek
someone's
documents
and
then
question
them
about
those
documents.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
because
the
notes
may
help
to
show
what
was
discussed
in
the
conversations
between
mr.
foster
and
mr.
hamilton
and
refresh
mr.
hamilton's
recollection.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
the
settled
case
law
in
the
lower
courts,
justice
ginsburg,
is
in
situations
where
the
witness
who
communicated
with
the
lawyer
is
unavailable,
then
those
portions
of
the
notes
that
at
least
reflect
the
factual
statements
of
the
witness
and
surrounding
information
must
be
disclosed,
even
when
the
client,
the
witness
is
still
alive.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
the
showing
that
has
to
be
made,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
a
showing
that
the
witness
in
question
is
no
longer
available
for
questioning,
as
the
second
and
third
circuit
stated,
and
that
is
what
the
showing
is,
and
that's
been
a
traditional
showing
in
the
lower
courts
and
is
approved
in
the
restatement,
that
suggest
that
the
notes
must
be
produced
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
those
opinions
have...
and
the
restatement
follow
what
upjohn
stated
on
that
point.
in
upjohn,
of
course,
and
this
goes
to
the
attorney-client
privilege
point
that
justice
ginsburg
raised,
a
fundamental
pillar
on
which
the
attorney-client
privilege
rests,
a
pillar
that
this
court
emphasized
in
upjohn,
is
that
the
client
can
be
questioned
directly
about
the
underlying
events,
and
that's
simply
not
true
after
death,
and
that's
what
fundamentally
alters
the
privilege
analysis
in
this
case.
the
client--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--no,
but
the
same
information--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--we
don't
know
what's
in
the
notes,
correct.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
well--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--ordinarily--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--ordinarily
when
you
disclose
information
to
your
attorney,
if
the
attorney-client
privilege
doesn't
apply...
for
example,
in
a
crime-fraud
situation
you
couldn't
come
in
and
say,
oh,
some
other
privilege
applies.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
well,
the
case
in
pennsylvania--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
again,
there
is
a
distinction
between
civil
cases
in
which
the
estate
is
a
party
and
other
civil
cases.
your
question
goes
to
the
unusual
nature
of
the
facts
presented
in
this
proceeding
and
in
cases
such
as
the
charles
stewart
case
or
the
macumber
case.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
it's
simply
silent
on
that
point,
justice
breyer.
we
have
not
found
instances.
a
lot
of
this
will
come
up,
of
course,
in
the
criminal
context
in
the
context
of
secret
grand
jury
proceedings
in
a--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--i
think
it
might
show
that
the
kind
of
situation...
that's
true,
and
also
shows
that
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here,
as
the
facts
and
the
statement
of
facts
indicate,
are
rarely
going
to
arise.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
i
couldn't
agree
more,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
empirical
question,
even
as
to
the
attorney-client
privilege
for
living
clients
outside
the
context
where
the
client
asserts
the
fifth
amendment,
there
is
very
little
empirical
support
behind--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--that's
exactly
right,
and
that's
important,
justice--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--that's
right,
and
actually,
justice
kennedy,
your
question
is
a
problem
in
the
law
notwithstanding
dying
clients.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that
was
my--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--that's
absolutely
right.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that's
right,
justice
scalia,
and,
in
fact,
what
i
was
going
to
say
is,
the
law
has
a--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
the
law
has
experience
with
the
situation
justice
kennedy
raises,
not
with
someone
dying
but
someone
pleading
or
being
granted
immunity,
and
there
are
complications.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
well,
i
think
justice
kennedy
was
positing
a
situation
in
an
organized
crime
type
of
case
where
the
lawyer
would
be
in
danger
if
the
client--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--well,
the
answer--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--in
that
case
is
that
the
attorney
must
disclose
the
communications
and
there
can
be
conflict
problems
if
there
was
a
joint
defense
arrangement
whereby
everyone
was
meeting
in
the
same
room.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
we
think
the
law
is...
in
federal
courts
there
is
no
law,
and
so
i
guess
it's
both.
we
don't
know
whether--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--we
don't
know
what
the
law...
we
don't
know
what
the
law
is,
justice
stevens.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
we
don't
think
the
d.c.
circuit
was
wrong.
we
do
think
the
d.c.
circuit's
articulation
of
the
phrase,
relative
importance,
has
some
inconsistency
with
what
this
court
has
stated
in
cases
such
as
branzburg--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--that
is
our
first
position.
our
second
position,
alternative
positions
is
that
relative
importance
is
a
standard
that
we
would
be
happy
with,
but
again,
we--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--it's
some
kind
of
vague
balancing.
as
to
pennsylvania--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--correct.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
well,
with
hesitation
at
raising
their
names
again,
mueller
&
kirkpatrick
do
suggest
that--
[laughter]
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
yes.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
that's
correct.
i
want
to
make
one
point
about--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--pennsylvania.
for
22
years,
justice
kennedy,
there's
been
experience
in
pennsylvania
after
cohen
v.
jenkintown
cab.
it's
a
big
state
with
a
lot
of
lawyers,
and
there's
no
evidence,
even
with
petitioners
and
their
amici
and
their
vast
resources,
of
any
chilling
going
on
in
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
based
on
the
experience--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--i
don't
think
many
people
have
thought
about
this
issue,
justice
breyer,
it
comes
up
so
rarely,
and
that
would
be
my--
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
--the
reason
that
there
is
a
dearth
is
the
factual
situation
rarely
comes
up,
we
think,
and
clients
know
when
they
talk
to
their
lawyers,
i'm
going
to
have
to
disclose
these
facts
when
i'm
called
to
testify
anyway,
so
that
kind
of
chilling
is
far
greater
than
anything
we
propose
here.
mr.
brett
m.
kavanaugh
i
thank
the
court.
