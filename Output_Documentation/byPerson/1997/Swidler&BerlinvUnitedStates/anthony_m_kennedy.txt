justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
counsel,
i
recognize
that
the
time
frame
for
your
briefing
was
compressed,
but
i
think
there
may
be
at
least
a
misimpression
left
by
your
footnote
22
at
page
21
and
it
bears,
too,
on
judge
tatel's
discussion
and
it
bears,
too,
on
your
opening
remarks
that
the
states
say
the
privilege
does
not
survive.
in
california,
at
least,
and
that's
one
of
the
states
you
cite
in
the
footnote,
the
privilege
does
expire
when
the
estate's
closed,
and
that's
been
so
for
35
years,
and
i
have
not
found
anything
in
the
literature
indicating
that
in
california
this
has
caused,
number
1,
any
lack...
any
diminishment
in
the
number
of
lawyers,
or
in
their
effectiveness
in
representing
their
clients.
and
so
i
think
it's
a
very
important
distinction
to
say
that
the
privilege
can
be
exercised
pending
the
administration
of
the
estate,
and
then
it
closes,
and
if
the
other
states,
or
some
of
them,
are
like
california,
that
is,
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
significant
indication
that
experience
has
shown
that
this
is
not
a
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
have
other
states
addressed
the
problem?
can
you
say
that
the
other
states
specifically
do
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
they
do
not
address
the
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
and
if
the
administrator
of
the
estate
is
designated
as
the
one
to
exercise
the
privilege,
then
that
means
the
lawyer
alone
would
not
be
able
to
exercise
it,
so
it
seems
to
me
you
can
infer
that
it
expires.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
i'm
correct
about
california,
you
would
agree
that
that
is
relevant
in
considering
whether
or
not
experience
shows
that
this
causes
a
problem.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
that
post
the
1965
california
amendment,
do
you
know?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
i'll
check
that.
well,
in
any
event,
in
your
brief
and
in
a
number
of
the
amicus
briefs
it's
stated
that
what
the
independent
counsel
is
requesting
here
is
very
sweeping
and
unprecedented,
but
we
have
at
least
california,
we
have
pennsylvania,
we
have
the
ali,
which
speaks
for
lawyers,
we
have
all
of
the
commentators
except
wigmore,
i
think,
and
we
have,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
the
privilege
that
in
any
event
is
inapplicable
when
estates
and
property
are
concerned.
it's
inapplicable
if
there's
an
ongoing
scheme
that
the
attorney
is
consulted
for
in
order
to
continue.
it's
inapplicable
as
to
fees,
inapplicable
as
to
clients
who
dispute
what
the
attorney
told
them
and
that
the
clients
then
are
in
dispute
and,
also,
the
privilege
that
we're
talking
about
here
is
one
only
as
to
compelled
testimony.
the
attorney's
ethical
duty
to
remain
silent
continues.
and
so
it
seems
to
me
that
this
not
the
sweeping
change
that
the
amicus
briefs
and
that
you
indicate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
hasn't
happened
in
california
for
35
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
period
of
claims
is
3
months,
the
period
for
filing
claims
against
the
estate
is
3
months
in
arkansas?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
this
is
very
important
and
i
want
to
pursue
it
with
you
a
little,
but
as
you
begin,
i'm
thinking
back
to
the
errors
on
a
case,
the
macumber
case.
you
indicate
that
one
of
the
situations
where
the
confidence
might
be
disclosable
is
when
the
client
confesses
a
crime
and
then
someone
else
is
charged
with
the
crime
after
the
death.
so
that's
the
instance
where
the
confidentiality
is
most
important
in...
to
encouraging
the
disclosure,
and
yet
we
have...
you
admitted
the
possibility,
in
any
event,
that
it
would
be
discoverable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
paradigm
example
of
that
is
when
the
client
confesses
the
crime
to
the
attorney.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
do
you...
what's
the
classic
instance
in
which
the
attorney
really
should
know
something
in
order
to
help
the
client,
but
that
the
attorney
would
not
hear
this?
the
client
would
be
silent
if
the
independent
counsel's
position
prevailed.
what's
the
classic
example,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
can't
be
confession
of
the
crime,
can't
be
property.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
the
father
have
to
do
that?
can't
he
just
say,
i
want
a
spendthrift
trust
for
my
son,
my
son
has
got
some
problems.
that's
all
he
needs
to
say.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
you're
presuming
that
there's
something
that's
very
necessary
for
the
attorney
to
know
that
the
client
won't
be
able
to
tell,
and
i
don't
see
that
in
that
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
that
context
your
brief,
i
think
at
about
page
8,
indicates,
well,
there's
no
danger
to
the
client
of
criminal
liability
once...
after
his
death,
but
there
is
substantial
danger
of
civil
liability.
if
x
confesses
to
the
attorney
that
he's
engaged
in
a
pattern
of
fraud
that's
criminal,
and
that
comes
out,
that
would
subject
his
estate
to
a
civil
liability
by
the
injured
persons.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.--
--well,
in
the
case
of
the
drug-user
son,
the
hypothetical
we
were
discussing,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
some
merit
to
that
argument.
attorneys,
especially
in
practices
where
they
advise
families,
often
have
this
kind
of
question.
what
shall
i
do
with
x
in
my
family
who's
an
alcoholic,
or
a
drug
user?
attorneys
engage
in
not
just
retrospective
analysis
of
what
happened.
they
try
to
give
guidance
for
the
future,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
profession
might
be
a
little
poorer
for
the
restriction
you
ask
us
to
adopt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
this
is
against
a
background
in
which
the
attorney
has
the
unceasing
ethical
obligation
not
to
discuss
the
confidential
communications.
we're
talking
only
about
compelled
testimony.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
even
there,
i'm
a
little
concerned.
suppose
that
there
is
a
multidefendant
crime,
and
there
are
five
lawyers
representing
five
different
defendants.
defendant
number
1
dies.
under
your
view
i
guess
the
prosecution
could
compel
the
attorney
for
the
now-deceased
defendant
to
disclose
all
of
the
information,
which
it
seems
to
me
might
among
other
things
put
the
attorney
for
the
deceased
clients
in
great
danger.
[laughter]
