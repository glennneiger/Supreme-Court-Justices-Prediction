wouldn't
you
suppose,
though,
that
the
extent
of
the
waiver
would
be
limited
by
the
extent
of
the
personal
representative's
authority,
which
i
guess
i
have
always
assumed
is
essentially
authority
over
property,
so
that
if
we're
concerned
about
reputational
protection
absent
a
statute,
i
would
suppose
the
personal
representative
could
not
waive
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
does
that
prove
very
much
for
your
side,
because
the
theory
of
the
testamentary
exception
is
that
the
client
would,
in
fact,
want
the
lawyer
to
talk
for
the
purpose
of
implementing
whatever
the
client's
intent
was.
the
assumption
seems
to
be
that
there's
a
point
to
which
the
client
wants
to
go.
that
was
the
object
of
the
will
or
the
trust,
or
what-not,
and
so
in
fact
the
theory
behind
that
exception
is
really
that
the
client
authorizes
it.
you're
arguing
for
the
converse
case,
in
which
we
assume
the
client
would
not,
so
what
does
that
prove?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
may
not
in
the
sense
that
in
this
case
there
is
in
fact
a
statement
that
can
be
attributed
to
the
client
saying,
i
want
you
to
talk
or
i
don't
want
you
to
talk,
but
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
reasonable
argument
that
the
client
wants
the
object
of
his
testamentary
intent
to
be
served
and
if
in
order
to
serve
it,
it
is
necessary
to
disclose
something,
it's
reasonable
to
suppose
the
client
would
want
the
disclosure.
i
think
that's
as
far
as
the
theory
goes.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
there
are
a
great
many
people
who
know
they
have
that
obligation,
or
at
least
that
there
is
a
general
theory
that
they
have
that
obligation,
but
they
do
not,
in
fact,
want
to
fulfill
it.
i
mean,
we're
being
realistic,
i
think.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
i
may
interrupt
you,
i
think
it's
the
difference
between
a
presumption
of
fact
and
a
presumption
of
law.
i
mean,
in
the
testamentary
case,
we
figure
in
fact
the
fellow
wants
to
accomplish
something.
if
we're
going
to
presume
it
in
this
case,
i
think
it
probably
would
have
to
be
a
presumption
of
law
quite
divorced
from
any
specific
actual
intent
on
the
part
of
the
client
because
we
know
that
if
embarrassment
would
in
fact
result
to
the
client's
reputation,
to
living
individuals,
probably
the
client
would
not
want
that
disclosed.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
ask
you
a
different
question,
which
hasn't
specifically
come
up,
i
think.
who
has
the
burden
of
persuasion
here?
do
you
have
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
if
we...
if
we
assume...
and
i
realize
that
you
dispute
this,
but
if
we
assume,
in
fact,
the
understanding
of
the
profession
has
been,
at
least
for
a
very
long
time,
that
there
is
a
privilege
as
broad
as
mr.
hamilton
argues
for,
so
that
we
start
with
a
privilege
which
has
been
established,
then
i
suppose
the
burden
would
be
upon
you,
in
fact,
to
justify
a
curtailment.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
kavanaugh,
in
that
case
it's
the
defendant
who
would
have
the
worry,
not
the
defendant's
lawyer.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
and
he
may
have
to
worry
about
it,
but
his
lawyer
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
the
lawyer
is
the
source--
--well,
i
am.
--of
the
information.
i
am.
what's
the
answer
to
it?
