justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
the
california
statute
has
been
construed
by
the
california
supreme
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
barred
the
testimony--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
a
case
construing
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
quite
as
well
known
as
professor
wigmore
and
the
like.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
you're
only
leaving
out
the
case
where
he's
confessing
to
a
crime,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
consultations
between
lawyers
and
clients
where
the
client
does
not
confess
to
a
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
point
is,
there
are
a
of
consultations
where
nobody
committed
a
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can't
assume
all
consultations
between
client
and
lawyer
involve
criminal
behavior.
generally,
we
presume
people
are
innocent
unless
somebody
proves
otherwise.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
we
know
that's
the
most
likely
consultation
between
lawyer
and
client?
clients
talk
to
lawyers
about
a
host
of
problems,
not
just
testamentary
dispositions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
maybe
one
reason
for
that
is,
it
has
generally
been
assumed,
as
the
literature
is
unanimous
on
it,
that
these
conversations
are
privileged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
background
assumption,
on
the
cases
you
describe
all
say
they
are
exceptions
from
the
general
rule.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--mr.
kavanaugh,
you
say
that
the
attorney
must
disclose
the
communications.
this
goes
to
your
basic
theory.
i'd
just
like
to
know,
are
you
urging
us
to
decide
what
the
law
now
is,
or
are
you
asking
us
to
change
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
want
us
both
to
say
what
the
law
now
is
and
change
it.
