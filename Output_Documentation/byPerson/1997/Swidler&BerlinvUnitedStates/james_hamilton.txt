mr.
james
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
sunday,
july
11,
1993,
at
10:00
a.m.
in
the
morning,
vince
foster
came
to
my
home
to
consult
me
as
a
lawyer
in
the
travel
office
matter,
which
was
then
the
matter
of
intense
public
controversy.
we
spoke
alone
for
2
hours,
during
which
time
i
took
three
pages
of
notes,
which
are
the
subject
of
this
litigation
here
today.
before
we
began,
mr.
foster
asked
me
if
the
conversation
was
privileged
and,
without
hesitation,
i
said
that
it
was.
it
is
not
disputed
that
my
notes
would
be
privileged
had
mr.
foster
not
taken
his
own
life
9
days
later
in
fort
marcy
park,
virginia.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
wish
to
make
five
major
points
this
morning
which
i
would
like
to
summarize
briefly
at
the
outset.
first,
any
balancing
test
or
ruling
that
leaves
the
existence
of
the
attorney-client
privilege
after
death
in
doubt
would
have
a
significant
chilling
effect
on
client
candor,
particularly
as
to
those
who
expect
to
die
soon,
because
people
do
care
about
their
reputations
and
the
fate
of
family
and
friends
after
death.
secondly,
independent
counsel's
central
contention
that
only
the
perjurer
would
be
chilled
if
the
privilege
does
not
survive
but
not
the
truthful
client,
or
the
client
intending
to
invoke
his
fifth
amendment
privilege,
is
contrary
to
reason
and
experience
and
is
unsupported
by
any
decision
of
this
court.
third,
the
conclusion
that
the
privilege
should
survive
in
civil
cases
but
not
in
criminal
cases
is
illogical
and
unworkable
and
is
supported
by
no
case,
no
statute,
or
no
commentator.
fourth,
all
the
pertinent
state
statutes
recognize
and
virtually
all
of
the
nontestator
cases
hold
that
the
privilege
survives
death,
and
the
testator
cases
generally
recognize
that
they
apply
an
exception
to
the
general
rule
that
is
intended
to
effectuate
the
testator's
intent.
mr.
james
hamilton
well--
mr.
james
hamilton
--justice
scalia,
that
is
correct,
but
they
apply
to
a
very
specific
situation,
when
there
is
a
will
contest,
where
there
is
a
question
about
the
testator's
intent.
mr.
james
hamilton
justice
souter--
mr.
james
hamilton
--justice
scalia,
it
is
certainly
the
situation
that
has
arisen
most
in
the
past.
i
would
suggest,
though,
that
if
the
court's
opinion
below
is
upheld,
the
situation
will
arise
much
more
in
the
criminal
context.
mr.
james
hamilton
there
are
only
two
cases
that
i
know
of.
one
is
the
case
here.
the
other
is
the
case
in
massachusetts,
the
case...
the
case
involved
a
john
doe,
as
it
is
styled.
mr.
james
hamilton
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
california
is
the
only
jurisdiction
that
has
that
specific
reservation
or
provision--
mr.
james
hamilton
--our
study
of
the
state
statutes
find
that
they
do
not.
i
would
also
point
out
that
there
are
a
number
of
states--
mr.
james
hamilton
--that
they...
well,
that
they
do
not
specifically
address
the
point.
mr.
james
hamilton
justice
kennedy,
in
a
number
of
states,
close
to
20
states,
the
state
provisions
apply,
or
say
that
the
lawyer
also
can
assert
the
privilege,
not
just
the
personal
representative
but
the
lawyer
also
and,
of
course,
that
indicates
that
the
survival
of
the
privilege
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
winding
up
of
the
estate.
mr.
james
hamilton
i
will
agree
that
it
is
a
relevant
factor.
i
should
point
out
that
there
is
a
california
case,
the
pena
case
that
we
cite
in
our
brief,
where
this
particular
statute
was
applied
in
a
criminal
case,
not
just
in
a
civil
case
relating
to
the
administration
of
the
estate.
mr.
james
hamilton
i
believe
it
was,
but
i'll
have
to
check
the
date
of
the
case--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
there
certainly
are
some
exceptions
that
you
have
mentioned,
but
so
far,
with
the
exception
of
this
case
and
the
one
case
in
pennsylvania,
there
has
been
no
case
that
has
found
that
in
a
nontestamentary
situation
that
the
privilege
expires
when
the
client
dies,
and
i
would
suggest,
as
i
suggested
to
justice
scalia,
that
if
this
court
upholds
the
lower
court
decision
we
will
have
many,
many
more
cases
that
will
raise
this
particular
issue.
mr.
james
hamilton
but
if
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
announces
that
the
privilege
expires
upon
death,
i
think
that
we
will
find
many,
many
more
cases
raising
this
particular
issue.
mr.
james
hamilton
by
the
california
supreme
court?
it
was
construed
by
a
california
court
of
appeals
in
1984.
it
was
applied
in
a
criminal
case
to
bar
the
testimony
of
an
attorney.
mr.
james
hamilton
yes.
mr.
james
hamilton
yes.
mr.
james
hamilton
the
foster
estate
is
not
wound
up.
mr.
james
hamilton
i
believe
that
is
correct.
as
far
as
i
know,
no
claims
have
been
filed
against
the
estate,
but
it's
not
been
finally
wound
up.
mr.
james
hamilton
i...
if
the
question
is
whether
the
attorney
is
the
personal
representative,
i
don't
believe
the
statutes
have
been
interpreted
that
way,
justice
breyer.
mr.
james
hamilton
that's
correct.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
under
california
law
the
personal
representative
is
the
one
who
can
assert
the
privilege.
mr.
james
hamilton
i
don't
believe
anyone
else--
mr.
james
hamilton
--the
attorney
is
not...
under
california
law
the
attorney
is
not
given
the
right
to
assert
the
privilege.
mr.
james
hamilton
at
the
california
law.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
certainly...
certainly,
justice
breyer,
in
many
states
the
lawyer
can
assert
the
privilege.
mr.
james
hamilton
justice
o'connor,
what
we
said
was
this,
that
in
a
situation
where
a
defendant's
rights
are
at
issue
and
where
denying
a
defendant
access
to
certain
information
might
unconstitutionally
arbitrarily
and
disproportionately
infringe
upon
his
or
her
right
to
weigh
the
evidence,
perhaps
the
court
in
that
situation--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
you
don't
know
that.
mr.
james
hamilton
if
there
was
some
demonstration
that
evidence
in
the
hands
of
an
attorney
would
be
crucial
to
a
defendant's
right
in
this
situation
i
would
not
oppose
in
camera
review.
mr.
james
hamilton
i
would
make
an--
mr.
james
hamilton
--justice
scalia,
in
the
case
of
a
situation
where
a
defendant's
rights
may
be
at
issue,
then
i
think
that--
mr.
james
hamilton
--that
is
still...
that
is
still
a
criminal
case.
mr.
james
hamilton
in
that
circum--
mr.
james
hamilton
--in
that
circumstance
i
would
not,
and
let
me
tell
the
court
why.
i--
mr.
james
hamilton
--justice
scalia,
courts
do
like
to
get
to
the
truth,
but
this
court
has
said
that
a
privilege
like
the
attorney-client
privilege
is
of
transcendent
importance.
it
is
important
so
clients
will
go
to
their
lawyers
and
talk
to
their
lawyers
with
candor.
that's
central
for
the
lawyer,
for
the
client,
but
also
for
the
administration
of
justice.
now,
if
we
have
a
rule
that
allows
the
privilege
to
be
broken
whenever
a
prosecutor
or
a
grand
jury
feels
that
he
or
it
needs
the
information
to
pursue
who
committed
a
crime,
then
the
privilege
will
be
of
little
value.
obviously,
here,
we
have
a
balancing,
if
you
will,
of
interest,
the
interest
in
having
lawyers
speak
to
their
clients
with
candor
and
the
interest
of
getting
to
the
truth,
but
all
of
the
privileges
that
we
have
recognize
that
to
some
degree,
to
some
degree
they
will
inhibit
the
search
for
information.
mr.
james
hamilton
justice
scalia,
in
this
particular
situation
i
do
believe
the
personal
representative
of
mr.
foster's
estate
could
waive
the
privilege.
mr.
james
hamilton
in
terms
of...
in
terms
of
who
can
waive
it?
mr.
james
hamilton
i
would
think...
justice
ginsburg,
we
have
not
briefed
that
particular
issue
but
i
would
think
that
in
that
circumstance
also
the
personal
representative
of
the
estate
could
waive.
mr.
james
hamilton
there
certainly
is
authority
for
the
proposition
that
the
personal
executive
can
waive
the
attorney-client
privilege.
mr.
james
hamilton
and
in
other--
mr.
james
hamilton
--and
in
other--
mr.
james
hamilton
--and
in
other
jurisdictions,
too.
mr.
james
hamilton
yes.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
the
cases
are
not
very
specific
on
that,
but
there
is
at
least
some
implication
that
the
personal
representative
could
waive
in
other
situations.
for
example,
let
me
speak
about
the
macumber
case,
because
i
think
that
is
an
example
of
how
the
courts,
even
in
affirming
the
privilege,
have
found
a
way
to
do
justice.
in
that
case,
on
remand
the
personal
representative
of
the
deceased's
estate
did
waive
the
privilege,
and
so
the
attorney's
testimony
was
available
to
the
court.
and
it
so
happened
in
that
situation
that
the
court
decided
that
the
testimony
was
untrustworthy
for
a
number
of
reasons,
and
it
was
not
admitted
into
evidence,
but
there--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
in
that
situation
the
attorneys
did
seek
guidance
from
the
bar
to
see
what
they
could
do,
so
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
attorneys
had
something
to
do
with--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
they
may
or
they
may
not.
i
mean,
we
don't
know
what
a
deceased
person
has
told
some
third
party,
so
it's
hard
to
speculate
as
to
what
someone
might
know,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
hamilton
the
fifth
one
was
this,
justice
ginsburg.
as
to
work
product,
the
court
of
appeals'
notion
that
even
seasoned
attorneys
do
not
exercise
any
professional
judgment
in
taking
notes
during
an
initial
client
interview
is
contrary
to
reason
and
experience,
it's
without
case
support,
and
it
is
contrary
to
the
facts
of
this
particular
case.
i
would
like
to
go
back
to
my
point
that
persons
will
not
talk
with
a
lawyer
with
candor
if
they
know
that,
when
they
die,
what
they
say
can
be
discovered
by
a
prosecutor.
over
and
over
and
over
again
this
court
has
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
privilege
is
to
encourage
clients
to
talk
to
their
lawyers
in
a
candid
fashion.
mr.
james
hamilton
in
the
extreme
situation
where
a
defendant's
rights
would
be
unconstitutionally,
arbitrarily
and
disproportionately
infringed
upon,
a
court
might
find
an
exception.
mr.
james
hamilton
that
is
the
paradigm
example
but,
justice
kennedy,
that
is
not
this
case.
here,
we
have
a
prosecutor
and
a
grand
jury
seeking,
not
specific
information
about...
that's
exonerating,
but
seeking
all
relevant
information.
mr.
james
hamilton
and
not
to
exonerate
anyone,
but
to
see
whether
prosecution
is
a
possibility.
as
i
was
saying,
the
candor
rationale
has
been
announced
by
this
court
in
upjohn,
jaffee,
fisher,
zolin,
trammel,
and
other
cases.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
i
think--
mr.
james
hamilton
--i
think
you
can
think
of
many
hypotheticals
where
a
client
might
be
disinclined
to
reveal
something
to
an
attorney
if
the
client
knew
that
after
death
it
might
be
revealed
to
the
prosecutor.
i
mean,
in
this
situation
an
attorney
would
have
to
say,
well,
i
would
like
for
you
to
tell
me
the
facts,
but
don't
tell
me
what's
really
bad,
what's
really
bad,
because
if
you
die
i
may
have
to
reveal
this
to
a
prosecutor.
so
i
think
you
can
come
up
with
many
hypotheticals
where
a
client
might
not
want
to
reveal
some
facts
to
the
attorney.
let
me
just
give
you
a
specific
one
that
i
used
in
the
court
of
appeals.
what
if
we
have
a
father
who
is
dying,
and
he
wants
to
consult
a
lawyer
about
the
criminal
drug
problems
of
his
child.
now,
in
this
circumstance
the
dying
father
will
know
that
as
soon
as
he
passes
away
some
prosecutor
might
be
able
to
get
to
the
information
that
he
has
imparted
to
his
lawyer
and,
in
that
circumstance,
i
think
that
candor
would
be
chilled,
because
the
father
is
not
going
to
want
to
say
things--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
he
may
not--
mr.
james
hamilton
--justice
kennedy,
the
father
may
not
come
to
the
lawyer
about
some
estate
problem,
may
not
come
to
the
lawyer
to
set
up
a
trust.
the
father
may
come
to
the
lawyer
to
consult
about
the
criminal
problems
of
his
son,
because
he
is
concerned
about
him
and
he
needs
advice
as
to
how
these
matters
should
be
handled.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
that,
of
course,
is
true.
the
privilege
applies
when
legal
advice
is
sought.
mr.
james
hamilton
well,
he
may
seek
the
lawyer's
advice
about
this
criminal
issue,
that
is
certainly
right.
people
who
are
near
death
do
not
always
consult
lawyers
about
estate
issues.
mr.
james
hamilton
if
you...
if
you
consult
me
and
you're
asking
my
advice
particularly
as
to
a
matter
that
may
affect
you
in
some
way,
yes,
it
is
privileged.
mr.
james
hamilton
if--
mr.
james
hamilton
--if--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well,
that
is
certainly
true.
that
is
certainly
true,
and
if
i
am
consulted
by
a
person
who
wants
my
legal
advice,
even
though
it
involves
issues
concerning
other
people,
that
type
of
conversation,
justice
stevens,
is
privileged.
now,
if
the
situation
is
only,
will
you
help
me
get
a
lawyer
for
my
son,
that
would
not
necessarily
be...
i
think
that
would
not
be
privileged,
but
certainly
you
can
consult
about
the
legal
issues
of
others.
you
can
consult
with
an
attorney.
you
can
ask
the
attorney
to
advise
you,
and
that
certainly
has
happened
in
my
own
practice.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
hamilton
mr.
chief
justice,
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
work
product
issue,
because
i
believe
mr.
kavanaugh
has
misstated
the
law
in
that...
in
that
area.
i
believe
that
the
upjohn
case,
the
hickman
case
demonstrate
that
the
type
of
notes
that
i
took
are
protected
by
the
work
product.
upjohn
says
that
notes
that
embody
what
the
lawyer
saw
fit
to
write
down
enjoy
special
protection,
not
an
ordinary
protection,
but
special
protection.
this
is
found
at
449
u.s.
at
399.
mr.
james
hamilton
the
work
product
privilege
is
intended
to
protect
the
adversary
system.
it
is
intended
to
let
lawyers
work
in
a
certain
sphere
without
interference.
mr.
james
hamilton
that's--
mr.
james
hamilton
--well--
mr.
james
hamilton
--i
think
this
court,
in
the
grolyer
case,
has
said
that
the
work
product
privilege
extends
even
after
the
litigation
involved
has
concluded,
but
the
purpose
is
to
protect
the
lawyer's
thought
processes,
his
methods
of
working.
this
protection--
mr.
james
hamilton
--i
have
not
read
any
opinion,
justice
scalia,
that
describes
it
that
way,
but
there
are
opinions,
including
the
moody
case
that
mr.
kavanaugh
cites,
that
say
that
the
work
product
privilege
belongs
to
the
lawyer
as
well
as
to
the
client,
because
the
cases
recognize
that
the
lawyer
has
an
interest
to
protect
and
the
lawyer
can
assert
that
work
product
privilege
even
though
the
client
does
not.
mr.
james
hamilton
it
is--
mr.
james
hamilton
--it
is
protecting
his
thought
processes,
his
methods
of
operation.
it
allows
him
to
prepare
his
cases
in
a
certain
amount
of
privacy,
knowing
that
his
adversaries
will
not
have
access
to
his
work
product.
