stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
this
were
california
you
would
be
able
to
assert
the
privilege,
is
that
right?
i
mean,
assuming
that
you
read
the
california
words,
personal
representative,
to
mean
someone
who
ceases
to
exist
when
the
estate
closes,
which
i
don't
know
whether
that's
true
or
not,
but
assuming
that
that
is
true,
because
here
the
estate
isn't
closed,
it
would
be
proper
to
assert
the
privilege,
even
under
california's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no,
it
says
in
california
that
if
there
is...
you
can't
claim
the
privilege
if
there
is
no
holder
of
the
privilege
in
existence,
and
the
holder
of
the
privilege
is
defined
as
a
personal
representative
of
the
client,
so
if
you
were
to
construe
that
as
saying
the
privilege
dies
after
the
estate's
closed,
still
you'd
be
able
to
assert
it
here
because
the
estate
hasn't
closed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not...
are
you
sure?
i
have
this
now
in
front
of
me.
i'm
reading
it
quickly,
but
it
says
the
lawyer
who
received
or
made
the
communication
subject
to
the
privilege
shall
claim
the
privilege,
in...
do
you
know
that...
that's
section
955.
it
seems
to
give
a...
i
don't
know
how
much
you've
looked
at
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
so
i'm
not
certain
that
the
lawyer
couldn't
assert
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
you
can't
question
a
person
after
his
death...
sorry.
you
can't
question
the
person
before
his
death
about
a
matter
that's
privileged,
can
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
how
do
you
know
that
he
didn't
talk
to
the
lawyer
about
privileged
matters,
matters
that
were
the
subject
of
some
other
privilege?
how
do
you
know
that?
you
haven't
seen
the
notes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
is
it
your
rule
that
what's
supposed
to
happen
is
that
after
a
person
dies
the
judge
is
supposed
to
go
through
the
notes
that
his
lawyer
has
to
see
if
they're
subject
to
some
other
privilege
or
not,
and
some
materials
would
survive
the
death
and
others
wouldn't
survive
the
death?
is
that
basically
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
some
conversations
with
lawyers
would
survive
death
as
privileged.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
you
might
have
told
the
attorney
what
you
told
your
wife,
or
what
your
wife
told
you,
or
what
you
told
your
psychiatrist,
or
what
the
psychiatrist
told
you,
or
any
other
dozens
of
privileges
that
could
apply.
so
if
you're
saying,
i
guess,
that
those
still
would
apply,
even
though
they'd
normally
be
waived
when
you
talk
to
somebody
about
them,
you're
asking
the
judge
to
start
picking
and
choosing
among
them,
is
there
any
common
law
support,
or
do
you
find
in
the
last
30
years,
even
in
california,
any
instance...
i
guess
you
did
a
handful,
six
or
something.
but
i
mean,
you
looked
at
hundreds
of
cases.
did
you
find
instances
where
either
in
civil
or
criminal
proceedings,
in
california
or
anywhere
else,
somebody
did
breach
this
privilege,
other
than
the
testamentary
context?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying,
necessarily,
cases.
i
mean,
is
it
the
practice
in
california
that
prosecutors
or
civil
litigants
routinely
obtain
material
on
discovery
from
a
lawyer
of
a
person
who's
died
after
the
closing
of
the
estate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
asking
you
basically...
you've
done
a
lot
of
excellent
research,
and
i'm
saying
in
the
course
of
that
research,
either
through
conversations
or
otherwise,
have
you
found
it
to
be
a
practice
in
california,
which
has
had
this
evidence
code
for
30
years,
have
you
found
that
it
is
the
practice,
have
you
found
an
instance,
either
in
cases
or
outside
of
cases,
where
lawyers
routinely
or
otherwise,
in
civil
or
criminal
proceedings
other
than
the
testamentary
context,
breached
the
lawyer-client
privilege?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you're
hold...
your
position
is
that
it
ends
for
both
civil
and
criminal...
no,
only
for
criminal?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
it's
only
for
criminal,
then
who...
which
group
of
states...
i
guess
the
answer's
none,
but
which
group
of
commentators
or
law
reformers
or
whatever
have
advocated
that
the
rule
apply...
terminate
only
in
criminal
but
not
civil
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
ali...
the
ali
does
not,
is
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
have
the...
what
i'm
quite
curious
about
is,
of
course,
the
california
code
and
maybe
pennsylvania,
i
don't
know,
are
maybe
a
little
ambiguous
as
to
whether
it
ends
at
death,
as
i
read
it
through
here,
so
an
explanation
to
the
dearth
of
cases
may
be
that
all
clients
basically
think
they're
privileged.
lawyers
think
they're
privileged.
everybody
thinks
they're
privileged,
so
they
don't
try
to
get
it.
now,
is
there
any
reason
you
have
for
thinking
what
i
just
said
is
wrong?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
the
reason
that
it
comes
up
rarely,
because
california
lawyers,
throughout
the
country
lawyers,
clients
throughout
the
country
go
in
to
a
lawyer
and
they
think,
i'm
safe.
they
all
think
that's
the
rule,
so
they
don't
try
to
get
it.
is
that
the
reason
why
there
is
a
dearth?
