mr.
donald
r.
patterson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
on
one
issue
only,
whether
the
gender
discrimination
provisions
in
8
u.s.c.
section
1409
violate
the
constitution.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
this
court's
opinion
in
fiallo
v.
bell
was
a
controlling
precedent.
it
is
our
position
that
fiallo
can
be
distinguished,
but
that
if
the
court
feels
that
it
applies,
that
fiallo
is
out
of
step
with
the
court's
more
recent
decisions
that
refuse
to
sanction
official
actions
that
close
a
door
to
opportunity
based
on
overbroad
generalizations
concerning
the
abilities,
or
personalities
or
such,
of
males
and
females.
the
immigration
&
nationality
act
draws
some
clear
distinctions
between
the
naturalization
of
an
individual
about
whom
alienage
is
not
in
dispute
and
those
persons
who
are
citizens
at
birth.
naturalization
is
the
conferring
of
nationality
of
a
state
upon
an
individual
subsequent
to
their
birth.
persons
who
are
born
overseas
to
a
u.s.
citizen
are
citizens
and
nationals
of
the
united
states
at
birth.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
my
client
has
set
foot
in
the
united
states,
in
fact
is
presently
in
the
united
states,
but
not
at
the
time
that
this
case
was
filed
and
originally
came
forth,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
unlike
the
person
who
is
seeking
naturalization
or
immigration,
ms.
miller
seeks
to
establish
her
citizenship
by
virtue
of
her
birth.
the
deference
accorded
the
congress
power
over
admissions
of
aliens
is
inapplicable
in
dealing
with
a
situation
where
someone
claims
citizenship
from
birth,
and
we
feel
there
is
a
clear
distinction
here,
that
she
has
been
denied
her
equal
protection
rights,
and
she
seeks
a
finding
that
she
is
a
citizen
at
birth,
and
thus
fiallo
can
be
distinguished.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
fiallo
dealt
with
a
situation
where
there
was
no
question
concerning
the
alienage
of
the
persons
involved.
in
this
case,
we
claim
that
my
client
should
have
been
entitled
to
citizenship
at
birth,
and
therefore
it
is
not
an
immigration
matter
but
a
citizenship
matter,
and
could
be
distinguished
on
that
basis.
fiallo
could
be
left
to
apply
in
cases
in
which
they
were
purely
immigration.
this
case
is
not
so
much
based
on
the
immigration
powers
of
congress
as
it
is
upon
the
gender
discrimination
that
is
established
in
this
provision.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
feel
that--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--your
honor,
while
the
court
gives
deference
to
congress
in
many
areas,
the
court
has
held
that
it
does
not...
deference
does
not
mean
abdication,
and
that
if
a
statute
is
violative
of
the
provisions
of
the
constitution,
then
that
statute
cannot
stand.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
think
congress
always
gets
a
certain
amount
of
deference,
your
honor,
in
any
case,
because
i
think
the
court
normally
approaches
that
they
are...
congress
is
entitled
to
do
what
is
within
its
realm,
but
if
it
violates...
if
it
provides
a
provision
that
deprives
people
of
the
equal
protection
of
the
constitution,
then
that
statute
cannot
stand,
and
dealing
with--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--there
is
not
a
constitutional
entitlement
of
citizenship
at
birth
unless
you
are
born
in
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
however,
the
congress
has
created
a
statute
which
provides
that
children
of
u.s.
citizen
parents
are
entitled
to
citizenship
at
birth,
but
then
they
have
in
effect
taken
away
that
right
as
to
those
children
who
are
illegitimate
in
that
section
1401
establishes
a
broad
general
statement
that
all
children
born
to
u.s.
citizen
parents
in
the
world
are
u.s.
citizens
at
birth.
then
in
14--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
think
it
would
be.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
the
congress
has
tremendous
powers.
congress
probably
could
decide--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that
no
one
born
outside
of
the
united
states
was
a
citizen.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
would
have
no
problem
with
that,
your
honor.
however,
that's
not
what
congress
has
done.
congress
on
the
one
hand
has
established
a
situation
where
the
mother
has
to
do
nothing
except
be
the
mother,
and
her
children
become
a
u.s.
citizen.
but
then
it
has
placed
very
strict
requirements
on
a
father
for
his
children
to
become
a
u.s.
citizen.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor,
and
as
to
children
born
prior
to
1934,
it's
only
been
recently
that
congress
has
gone
back
to
correct
that
situation.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
sir?
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
feel
that
under
the
present
interpretations
of
the
constitution,
that
it
would
be
found
to
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
under
the
precedent
that
then
existed,
i
would
assume
that
it
was
not
unconstitutional,
but
i
feel
that
under
the
precedents
that
exist
now,
it
would
be
considered
unconstitutional.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
your
honor,
we
feel
that
1409
as
it
exists
now
is
an
unconstitutional
discrimination
based
on
gender,
and--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--your
honor,
basically,
though,
1409
we
view
as
being
a
gender
discrimination
issue,
and
that
in
this
situation,
that
if
it
did
not
apply
my
client
would
be,
under
the
general
terms
of
1401,
a
citizen,
and
we
feel
that
there
is
a
distinction
between
a
situation
where
someone
is
purely
an
alien,
no
question
about
it
all,
of
their
alienage,
and
a
situation
where
there
is
a
relationship,
a
tie
to
the
united
states
through
a
citizen
parent,
and
that
the
rules
as
to
the
citizen
parent
should
be
the
same
whether
the
parent
is
a
woman
or
a
man.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--all
right.
there
are
some
questions,
your
honor,
but
my
understanding
is
that
statistically
there
are
more
female
u.s.
citizens
abroad
than
male
u.s.
citizens.
i
do
know
that
within
the
armed
forces
that
now
the
percentage
is
somewhere
like
13
or
14
percent
of
all
the
armed
forces
are
now
female.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
so
while
we
may
have
had
a
problem
with
one
situation
in
the
past,
i
think
the
situation
is...
has
the
potential
to
change.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
right.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
also
the
question
or
the
issue
we
have
here
is
that
the
requirements
are
placed
on
the
male
to
do
something.
all
that
the
woman
has
to
do
is
be
the
parent.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
right.
if
there's
any
hospital
record--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--but
there...
the
answers
as
to
the
male
parent
can
be
established
with
modern
technology.
the--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
however--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--right.
there
are
potential
problems,
but
the
problems
can
be
dealt
with.
we
feel
that
the
only
requirement
should
be
that
there
be
proof
submitted
that
this
is
the
child
of
a
u.s.
citizen.
now,
what
that
proof
may
be,
because
there's--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
think--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
feel
that
while
there
have
been
some
other
areas
where
this
court
has
determined
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
have
an
immediate
determination
of
the
parentage
of
a
child
for
the
child
to
ultimately
be
able
to
proceed
in
terms
of
inheritance
and
this
sort
of
thing,
in
a
sense
this
is
an
inheritance.
this
is
an
inheritance
of
a
citizenship,
and
we
would
like
to
see
the
tables
leveled
as
to
both
the
male
and
female
as
to
what
takes
place.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
your
honor,
we
feel
that
she--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--right,
your
honor,
and
the
government
in
a
motion
said
that
the
rights
and
benefits
of
u.s.
citizenship
he
already
enjoys
simply
have
not
been
injured
by
the
denial
of
lorelyn
penero
miller's
application.
the
rights,
if
any,
which
have
been
injured
are
those
of
lorelyn
penero
miller,
the
true
plaintiff
in
this
action.
and
so
while
he
was
in
the
case
the
government--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
we
feel
that
under
the
criteria
that
the
court
has
set
out
for
third
party
plaintiffs
to
proceed
are
based
on
third
party
claims,
that
there
has
to
be
an
injury,
which
there
is,
there
has
to
be
a
relationship,
which
there
is.
the
only
issue
that
the
government
has
raised
in
its
brief
is
the
issue
of
a
hindrance,
and
we
would
say
that
there
is
a
hindrance
created
by
the
government
in
their
motion
to
remove
him
from
the
case,
that
they
took
him
out--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--basically
their
argument
in
their
motion,
your
honor,
was
as
i
said,
that
he
had
not
made
application
for
u.s.
citizenship;
he
was
not
denied
any
rights;
he
had
his
citizenship;
that
the
denial--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
no,
your
honor,
there
was
not
an
attempt
to
appeal.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
am
not
certain,
your
honor,
and
i
would
think
that
that
was...
one
of
the
factors
that
entered
into
us
not
appealing
was
the
fact
that
it
was
moved
to
another
circuit,
that
the
principal
issues
were
still
before
the
court
in
the
district,
and
we
felt
that
we
could
go
forward
and
proceed
there,
that--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
that
is
correct.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
the
only
issue
is
the
issue
of
the
legitimation
and
my
client,
though
subsequent
to
the
age
of
21,
or
that
was
required
under
the
prior
statute,
went
into
court
in
texas,
filed
a
voluntary
paternity...
or
her
father,
my
client's
father
went
into
court
in
texas,
filed
a
voluntary
paternity
action,
and
was
determined
by
the
courts
of
texas
that
he
is
the
father
of
ms.
miller,
and
ultimately,
so
far
as
texas
is
concerned,
legally
his
child
and
his
heir.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--your
honor--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
am...
my
reaction
is
that
whether
congress
could
do
it
or
not,
it
would
be
wrong.
now--
[laughter]
my
feeling,
though,
is
that
basically--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--but
basically,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
issue
here
has
to
do
with
the
cases,
and...
such
as
mississippi
university
for
women,
et
cetera,
where
they
have
said
that
distinctions
based
on
gender
have
to--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
if
we
take
the
government's
argument,
accept
it
in
toto,
congress
could
do
that.
we
feel
that
would
be
wrong,
and
we
feel
that
it
is
wrong--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--your
honor,
we
feel
that
there
is
a
matter
of
discrimination
here
based
on
gender,
and
we
feel
that
if
you
take
it
to
the
logical
extreme
that
the
government
espouses,
that
the
court
should
defer
to
congress'
decisions
in
anything
having
to
do
with
immigration,
citizenship,
et
cetera.
if
you
take
it
to
that...
to
the
extreme,
then
the
suggestion
by
the
justice
would
be
permissible.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
think
that,
your
honor,
basically
the
issue
is
one
of
who
is
entitled
to
citizenship
at
birth,
and
congress
has
decided
that
as
a
general
rule,
anybody
born
to
a
u.s.
citizen
parent
is
entitled
to
be
a
citizen
at
birth.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
didn't
hear
the
question.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
they
then
have
decided
that
any
person
who
is
born
illegitimately
to
a
mother
who
is
a
u.s.
citizen
is
a
citizen
at
birth.
the
only
distinction
that
is--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--all
right.
your
honor,
on
the
one
hand
they
talk
about
attachment,
but
there's
nothing
in
the
statute
that
requires
any
showing
of
attachment
or
the
mother
do
anything,
other
than
have
the
child.
if
the
mother
had
the
child
and
abandoned
it
immediately,
the
child
would
still
be
eligible
for
citizenship
regardless
of
whether--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
believe--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
think,
your
honor,
in
other
contexts
the
court
has
said
that
you
deal
with
individuals,
not
with
generalizations,
and
while
this
may
be
true
as
a
generalization,
it
is
not
true
in
all
circumstances.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
obviously,
congress
can
to
some
extent,
but
where
they
discriminate
against
a
group
based
on
generalizations
that
are
based
on
stereotypic,
archaic
ideas,
then--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
would
agree
with
your
honor
on
that.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
think,
your
honor,
that
for
anyone
there
would
have
to
be
some
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
they
were
the
parent,
be
it
the
mother
or
the
father.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
don't
believe
i
would
have
any
problem
with
that,
your
honor,
because
i
feel
that
to
me
would
be
a
prerequisite
regardless,
though
it
is
not
spelled
out
that
there
has
to
be
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
the
mother
was
the
mother
of
the
child
for
the
child
to
be
able
to
claim
u.s.
citizenship.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
feel
that
that
is
a
distinction
that
could
be
drawn.
however,
i
think--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
have
some
precedents,
and
i
was
trying
to
find
it,
that
the
constitution
is
not
limited
to
the
boundaries
of
the
united
states.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
your
honor,
in
united
states,
and
i'm
not
sure
of
the
exact
pronunciation,
v-e-r-d-u-g-o...
u-r-i-q-u-i-d-e-z,
at
494,
259,
278,
in
a
concurring
opinion,
judge
kennedy
indicated
that
the
government
may
only
act
as
the
constitution
authorizes
whether
the
actions
in
question
are
foreign
or
domestic.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
i
think--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--right.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
well,
i
believe
that
is
my
recollection,
but
i...
it's
been
a
while
since
i
have
read
that,
but
i
do
know
that
it
raised
the
issue,
and--
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
--i
believe
so.
i'd
have
to
check
to
be
sure,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
r.
patterson
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
there
are
no
further
questions?
