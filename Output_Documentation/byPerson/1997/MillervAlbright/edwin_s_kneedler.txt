mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
naturalization
clause
of
the
constitution
commits
to
congress
the
power
that
is
inherent
in
any
sovereign
nation
to
determine
which
aliens
abroad
will
be
granted
united
states
citizenship.
as
this
court
said
in
the
ginsberg
decision,
no
alien
has
the
slightest
right
to
naturalization
unless
all
statutory
conditions
are
satisfied,
any
by
the
same
token,
the
court
has
said
in
the
rogers
v.
belli
decision
that
was
just
cited,
no
united
states
citizen
has
a
right
to
transmit
citizenship
by
dissent.
now,
to
be
sure,
where
the
interests
of
the
united
states
citizen
are
properly
before
the
court,
and
in
this
case
we
suggest
that
they're
not,
but
where
they
are,
such
as
in
fiallo
or
kleindienst
v.
mandel,
this
court
has
declined
to
hold
that
congress'
judgments
in
this
area
are
wholly
beyond
judicial
review.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
motion
to
dismiss
in
texas,
there
were
really
two
grounds.
one
was
essentially,
while
couched
as
a
standing
ground
was
essentially
a
merits
argument,
and
that
is
that
his
argument
of
gender-based
discrimination
was
foreclosed
by
fiallo
v.
bell.
the
government
also
argued
essentially
that
because
the
claim
to
citizenship
was
that
of
the
petitioner
here
and
not
his
own,
that
he
effectively
had
no
ability
to
insist
that
the
government
confer
citizenship
on
her.
that
is
more
in
the
nature
of
a
standing
argument.
now,
again,
in
fiallo,
where
the...
there
were
rights
of...
both
citizen
plaintiffs
and
alien
plaintiffs
were
before
the
court,
and
the
court
then,
because
of
that
presence,
addressed
the
constitutional
question
because
of
the
presence
of
the
alien
parent,
even
though
the...
i
mean,
the
citizen
parent,
even
though
the
citizen
parent
couldn't
have
required
in
a
sense
to
have--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the...
it
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
did...
it
moved
to
dismiss
her
also
on
a
ground
that
she
could
not
claim
his
equal
protection
rights.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
government
certainly
did
argue
that
fiallo
was
controlling
across
the
board,
but
i
think
our...
the
point
here
is
that
whatever
the
label
attached
to
it,
the
father
was
dismissed
from
the
case,
essentially
rejecting
his
claim
under
fiallo,
and
he
did
not
appeal
either
from
the
texas
ruling
at
the
time
or
from
the
final
judgment
at
the
time
it
was
rendered
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
acknowledge
that
the
standing
argument
in
texas
may
not
have
been
properly
couched
as
a
standing
argument.
the
fact
remains,
though,
that
that
is
a
past
ruling
in
the
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
you
mean
in
the
texas
state
court
proceeding?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
record
in
this
case
does
not
disclose
what
was
before
the
texas
court
at
the
time.
it's
not
clear
that
it
consisted
of
much
more
than
his
statement
that
he
is
the
father,
but
of
course,
under
the
immigration
statute,
and
the
naturalization
statute
we
have
at
issue
here,
that's
all
that
would
have
been
required
as
well
to
establish
paternity,
given...
in
light
of
the
1986
amendments.
prior
to
that
time,
he
would
have
needed
a
formal
legitimation
such
as
the
court
decree
here,
but
under
the
1986
amendments
all
that
was
required
was
an
acknowledgement
before
the
state
department
of
his
paternity.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
yes.
my
only
point
is
that
we
have
not
acknowledged
in
this
case
that
he
has
satisfied
all
the
requirements
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
if
the
legitimation
decree
was...
had
been
entered
before
she
was
a
teen,
or
before
she
was
21
under
the
prior
version
of
this
statute,
that
official
determination
would
have
been
controlling,
but
if
that
decree
is
simply
relied
on
as
evidence
of
blood
relationship,
then
we
do
not
think
it
is
controlling
on
the
state
department.
the
state
department
was
not
a
party
to
that
case,
so
insofar
as
she
is
applying
on
the
basis
of
events
that
happened
before
age
21,
or
before
age
18,
we
think
she
would
have
to
carry
that
burden
of
proof
before
the
state
department.
the
state
department
did
not
reach
that
question,
as
you
pointed
out
in
this
case.
the
basis
for
the
state
department's
rejection
for
a
claim
in
this
case
was
really
the
failure
to
establish
the
formal
parent-child
relationship
prior
to
the
age
18
or,
under
the
prior
statute,
age
21,
so
really
the
issue
before
this
court
and
before
the
district
court
was
whether
congress
can
properly
impose
a
limitation
of
that
sort
on
the
time
in
which
the
father
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
can
take
steps
to
legitimate
the
child.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
he
probably
could
have
done
either
of
two
things.
one
would
be
to
ask
for
a
rule
54(b)
certification
in
texas
and
taken
immediate
appeal
then,
perhaps,
or,
with
the
case
transferred,
once
the
final
judgment
was
entered
here,
i
assume
that
the
father
could
have...
that
mr.
miller
could
have
appealed
from
the
final
judgment
at
that
time.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
think
so.
i'm--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
yes.
no,
i
meant
if
a
54(b)
certification
or
an
interlocutory
appeal
request
had
been
filed
before
the
case
was
actually
transferred,
but...
and
he
presumably
could
have
requested
the
district
court
in
texas
to
say,
before
you
actually
transfer
the
case...
i
know
that's
what
the
government
has
asked
for,
but
before
you
actually
do
that,
afford
me
the
opportunity
to
take
an
interlocutory
appeal,
or
appeal
of
the
final
judgment
insofar
as
the
case
would...
the
decision
would
finally
dispose
of
my
claim.
but
he
didn't
do
that.
the
case
was
transferred
to
the
district
of
columbia,
and
i
don't
think
he
would
have
been
foreclosed
from--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
not
sure
of
that
timing.
i
think
that
once
there
is
the
order
of
transfer,
i
think
it
would
be
entry
of
the
order
of
transfer
that
would
transfer
it
to
the
district
of
columbia,
but
again,
i
don't
believe
that
would
have
terminated
his
right
to
take
an
appeal,
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
texas.
my
point
is
that
i
think
he
was
a
party
to
this
case
when
it
was
filed.
there
was
no
final
judgment.
once
the
case
got
to
the
district
of
columbia,
i
don't
know
a
reason
why
he
couldn't
have
appealed
from
the
final
judgment
here.
the
case
was
transferred
along,
i
assume
with
all
interlocutory
orders
that
led
up
to
that,
and
one
of
those
orders
was
the
dismissal
of
him
as
a
party,
so
i
think
once
the
final
judgment
was
entered
here...
this
has
not
been
an
issue
in
the
case,
but
that
has
been
my
sense.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
i
think
it's
not.
in
rogers,
there
was
a
situation
where
there
was
a
conferral
of
citizenship
subject
to
a
subsequent
loss
of
divestiture,
on
failure
to
satisfy
conditions
subsequent,
so
at
that
point
we
think
that
the
person
had
her
foot
in
the
door,
or
his
foot
in
the
door
towards
citizenship,
in
fact
was
granted
citizenship,
and
it
was
about
to
be
taken
away.
and
this
situation
is
very
different.
the
question
is
whether
the
petitioner
is
entitled
to
citizenship
in
the
first
instance
and,
as
this
court
pointed
out
many
years
ago
in
the
wong
kim
ark
decision,
the
conferral
of
citizenship
on
anyone
who
is
not
born
within
the
united
states
is
an
act
of
naturalization.
whether
that's
done
at
the
time
of
birth
or
whether
it's
done
by
procedures
in
the
united
states
later,
or
whether
it's
done
by
categories
in
conquered
territory
or
whatever,
that
is
all
an
exercise
of
congress'
naturalization
power.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
we
don't
believe
she
could...
that
1401
would
grant
citizenship
at
all,
because
1409--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
her
position,
but
we
think
that's
an
incorrect
interpretation
of
the
statute.
1409
is
the
only
subject...
section
of
the
act
that
deals
with
the
subject
of
children
born
out
of
wedlock,
and
congress...
it
was
a
very
difficult
subject
for
congress
to
address
in
the
nationality
act
of
1940
and
ever
since
then,
and
there
was
considerable
debate
leading
up
to
the
passage
of
the
1940
act
about
how
to
deal
with
a
situation
of
one
citizen
parent,
one
foreign
parent,
and
in
particular,
how
to
deal
with
the
problem
posed
where
you
had
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock
where
you
have
a
u.s.
citizen
parent
and
an
alien
parent.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
our
bottom
line
is
that
the
due
process
clause
does
not
apply
to
her.
whether
that
comes
from
interpreting
the
word
person
or
whether
it
is
just
a
broader
consideration
of
the
territorial
scope
of
the
fifth
amendment,
i'm
not
sure
much
turns
on
that,
but
in
this
court's
decision
in
johnson
v.
eisentrager,
which
was
reiterated
in
the
verdugo
decision,
the
court
said
that
aliens
outside
the
united
states
have
no
rights
under
the
fifth
amendment.
whether
she
has
since
come
to
the
united
states
is
irrelevant
for
these
purposes,
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
believe
that
was
with
respect
to
access
to
courts,
where
another
aspect
of
johnson
v.
eisentrager
was
whether
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
would
lie.
we're
not
suggesting
that
she
has
no
right
of
access
to
the
u.s.
courts
to
make
her
claim.
all
we're
saying
is
that
her
claim
fails
on
the
merits
because
both,
we
think
as
an
attribute
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states,
someone
outside
the
united
states
who
is
not
a
citizen
has
no
constitutional
right
to
claim
it,
but
also
because
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
the
clause
of
the
constitution
on
which
she
specifically
relies,
that
that
does
not
apply
outside
the
united
states.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
or
in
another
state
under--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
but
we
believe
that
aspect...
and,
again,
it's
an
inherent
aspect
of
the
sovereignty
of
the
united
states.
the
constitution
is
a
compact
among
the
people
of
the
united
states,
and
congress
is
the
political
branch
responsible
for
determining
who
can
be
admitted
and
assume
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
being
a
member
of
that
society,
so
we
think
that
this
is
a
proposition
that
inheres
in
the
nature
of
sovereignty,
and
is
not
trumped
by
the
fifth
amendment,
particularly
with
respect
to
an
alien
abroad.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
with
all
respect,
we
think
it
is
quite
soundly
rational,
and
if
i
may
just
preface
my
response--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--with
a...
preface
it
with
an
important
point
that
i
think
sometimes
gets
overlooked
in
this.
the
point
is
not
simply
what
tends
to
be
true
factually.
what...
the
steps
that
a
father
can
take,
are
formal,
recorded
steps
that
are
parallel
to
what
happens
when
a
child
is
born
in
the
hospital.
where
there's
a
birth
certificate,
you
have
a
witnessed
birth,
there
will
normally
be
no
question
whatsoever
as
to
who
the
mother
is,
and
by
virtue
of
that
you
have
an
established
legal
relationship
from
the
moment
of
birth.
not...
we're
not
getting
to
the
question
of
caretaker
or
anything.
you
have
an
established
legal
relationship
from
the
moment
of
birth
that
follows
the
profound
experience
of
carrying
and
bearing
the
child.
at
that
point,
it
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
a
parent,
mother
or
father,
but
in
this
case
it
is
only
the
mother,
because
the
child
was
born
out
of
wedlock,
who
has
the
legal
relationship,
will
follow
through
with
the
caretaking
relationship,
with
the
love
and
responsibilities
that
come
in
the
case
of
only
one
parent,
and
that
is
the
situation
that
is
addressed
by
309(c).
there
may
be
other--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
question,
justice
ginsburg,
is
not
am
i
a
parent,
but
am
i
a
parent
in
contemplation
of
law,
and
citizenship
is
a
formal
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
a
person.
it
is
a
permanent
relationship,
and
congress
is
entitled
to
insist
on
an
element
of
formality
and
legal
acknowledgement
in
doing
that.
the
question
is
not
whether
mr.
miller
had
an
established
personal
relationship
with
petitioner
during
her
minority,
although
there's
no--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
have
certainly
not
retreated
from
that.
you've
asked
me
several
questions,
if
i
could
just
take
a
moment
and
respond
to
them.
first
of
all,
in
the...
as
this
court's
decision
in
fiallo
made
clear,
congress'
power
over
immigration
and
naturalization
is
quite
different
from
something
that
would
happen
in
the
domestic
context,
and
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why
that's
so.
one
of
the
parties
to
the
transaction
is
an
alien
abroad,
not
even
protected
by
the
constitution
at
all.
there
are
questions
of
sovereign
authority,
of
foreign
relations,
of
congress
taking
into
account
conditions
abroad.
that's
both
fact-finding
and
meshing
u.s.
law
with
foreign
law.
so
the
circumstances
we
think
are
very
different.
there's
another
big
difference
in
the
way
that
just
what's
at
stake
in
this
case
and
in
the
vmi
case.
there,
the
court
was
dealing
with
a
categorical
exclusion
of
women
from
the
institution,
and
the
court
was
concerned
with
closing
the
door
and
denying
opportunities
to
men
and
women,
as
the
court
put
it.
here,
there
is
no
denial...
no
categorical
exclusion,
no
denial
of
opportunities.
all
mr.
miller
had
to
do,
if
he
had
the
sort
of
relationship
that
you
were
describing,
is
to
take
the
simple
step
of
making
that
relationship
formal
and
legal
during
the
child's
minority.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
needless
to
say,
this
case
doesn't
go
that
far,
but
the
question
under
fiallo,
the
standard,
is
whether
the
justification
advanced
is
one
that
is
facially
legitimate
and
bona
fide,
and
in
this
country's
history
of
race
relations
it
would
be
difficult
to
imagine
what
a
proper
justification
would
be
under
parallel,
i
suppose,
to
those
sorts
of
things
that
might
be
proffered
for
compelling
justification,
but
here--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i'm
saying
in
terms
of
what
sort
of
justifications
one
could
imagine,
and
i...
this
country--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
in...
again,
given
this
country's
history
of
race
relations,
and
if
there
was
a
u.s.
citizen
claiming
an
effect
on
his
ability
to
transmit
because
of
that,
it
may
be
that
under
the
phrase,
facially
legitimate,
this
court
would
conclude
that
that
is
not
a
legitimate
justification.
but
there's
a
very
different...
if
i
may
just
go...
explain
what's
different
about
this
case,
this...
i
think
it
is
clear
that
at
the
moment
of
birth
there
is
a
categorical
difference
between
the
mother
and
the
father
of
the
u.s.
citizen
and
the
mother
because,
as
i
described
earlier,
in
the
child
born
out
of
wedlock,
the
mother
has
a
legal
relationship
with
the
child
from
the
moment
of
birth.
the
father
does
not,
unless
the
father
or
someone
else
takes
a
step
in
law
to
establish
that
relationship.
it
isn't
just
the
question
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
of
proof
20
or
30
years
later
as
to
whether
in
fact
the
man
was
the
father.
the
question
is,
was
that
legal
relationship
established
during
the
child's
minority,
because
the
legal
relationship
is
not
just
important
in
its
own
right.
it
is
emblematic
and
often
fostering
of
a
deeper
personal
relationship.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no.
with
all
respect,
i
think
that
very
situation
shows
why
congress
has
particularly
broad
deference
in
this
area,
because
what...
congress
has
to
judge
not
only
the
situation
in
the
united
states
and
the
u.s.
citizen
who
may
have
a
stake
in
it,
but
what
is
the
situation
abroad
in
the
foreign
country
where,
after
all,
the
child
was
born?
and
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
congress
was
very
concerned,
and
the
legislative
history
makes
this
quite
clear,
that
a
child
born
to
a
u.s.
citizen
on
foreign
soil,
and
this
remains
true
in
the
philippines,
that
child
does
not
have
citizenship
of
the
country
where
she
is
born,
so
there's
a
very
real
problem
of
statelessness.
so
what
congress
is
weighing
there
is
perhaps
a
weaker
tie
to
the
united
states,
but
perhaps
no
legal
status
at
all
in
the
country
of
birth,
and
so
what
congress
did
there
is
to
say,
in
that
situation,
because
we
are
concerned
for
the
child
and
for
the
mother
of
the
child,
who
is
a
u.s.
citizen,
we
are
prepared
to
accept
a
somewhat
weaker
link
to
the
united
states
in
that
situation
because
of
the
counterbalance.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
pardon
me?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
it's...
we
quote
it
in
the...
in
the
1952
report
in
our
brief,
and
there
is
discussion--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
on
page
34
of
our
brief.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
we
cite
the
senate
report.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
all
the
father
had
to
do
during
her
minority
was
to
take
the
step
of
either
legitimating
the
child--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
conceivable
there
could
be
an
as-applied
challenge
to
this
statute,
but
in
the
immigration
area
in
particular
congress
is
entitled
to
legislate
by
categories,
and
congress
is
entitled--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
the
exception
and
whether
there
might
be
another
one
i
can't
address.
what
we
have
here
is
a
very
different
context.
at
the
time
the
court
decided
fiallo
this
court
has
already
decided
craig
v.
boren
and
concluded
that
gender
distinctions
in
the
domestic
context
have
to
be
justified
as
having
a
substantial
relation
to
an
important
governmental
interest,
and
also
applied
heightened
scrutiny
with
respect
to
illegitimacy.
but
right
contemporaneously
with
that...
and
this
case
is
really
about
children
born
out
of
wedlock,
and
as
in
this
court's
decision
in
lehrer
v.
robertson,
where
the
court
said
the
statutory
scheme
is
not
likely
to
omit
many
responsible
parents,
we
think
that
is
exactly
true
here.
anyone
who
wanted
to
establish
the
requisite
relationship
during
the
child's
minority,
and
that's
the
period
that
congress
was
focusing
on,
all
that
person
had
to
do
prior
to
1986
was
to
provide
for
legitimation
of
the
child.
congress
in
1986
liberalized
that,
not
requiring
a
formal
court
to
create
it,
not
requiring
the
father
to
go
to
another
country.
all
he
had
to
do
was
file
a
statement
with
the
state
department
acknowledging
the
paternity
of
the
child
and
assuming
an
obligation
equivalent
to
that
of
the
mother
that
flows
from
that,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
legal
relationship,
the
acknowledgment,
the
promise
to
support
that
would
flow
from
the
mother's
preexisting
legal
relationship
with
the
child.
and
if
i
may,
with
respect
to
the
suggestion
of
the
irresponsible
parent,
or
the
parent
who
may
abandon,
i
don't
think
congress
is
required
to
establish
a
statutory
scheme
on
the
possibility
that
someone
in
the
other
category
may
not
live
up
to
the
legal
responsibilities
that
the
law
prescribes,
but
in
any
event,
this
statute
applies
equally
as
to
both
categories.
the
mother
who
bears
the
child
and
either
abandons
or
gives
the
child
up
a
week
later,
that
child
is
a
citizen.
the
same
is
true
for
a
father
who
acknowledges
or
legitimates
a
child.
if
that
father
does
not
subsequently
remain
responsible,
that
child
remains
a
citizen.
the
question
is
simply
the
timing
of
when
the
father
steps
forward
to
assume
his
responsibilities
for
the
child
abroad.
and
one
other
point
to
bear
in
mind,
in
many
cases...
and
this
is
not
a
generalization
about
the
nature
of
men
and
women.
it's
a
statistical
legal
fact
that
in
the
cases
of
a
child
born
out
of
wedlock,
when
you
have
a
u.s.
citizen
mother,
that
will
very
often
be
the
only
parent.
where
you
have
a
u.s.
citizen
father
who
takes
the
steps
to
legitimate
and
the
other
steps,
that
means
there
are
two
parents
with
a
legal
relationship,
one
parent
here
and
one
parent
in
the
other
country.
so
this
is
a
situation
which,
in
fashioning
these
categorical
schemes,
congress
necessarily
has
to
balance
the
different
considerations
that
arise,
and
so
it's
not
just
the
question
of
the
u.s.
citizen
parent.
