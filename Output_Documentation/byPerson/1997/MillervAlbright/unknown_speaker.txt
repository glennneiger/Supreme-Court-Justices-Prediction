unknown
speaker
am
i
right,
mr.
patterson,
in
thinking
that
your
client
has
never
set
foot
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
but
how
do
you
say
fiallo
is
distinguishable
in
that
regard?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
have
a
part
of
a
law
of
congress
declared
unconstitutional
in
order
to
establish
your
client's
citizenship,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
you
say
there's
no
deference
to
congress
in
this
respect?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
some
of...
there's
language
in
some
of
our
cases
that
say
in
the
field
of
immigration
and
nationality
we
give
extraordinary
deference
to
what
congress
has
decided.
now,
you're
saying,
i
guess,
that
when
you're
talking
about
nationality
as
opposed
to
immigration
the
congress
gets
no
special
deference.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
with
a
question?
i'm
not
sure
i
understood.
are
you
saying
there
is
a
constitutional
entitlement
to
citizenship
at
birth?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
just
interrupt
with
a
simple
question
to
be
sure.
would
it
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
pass
a
statute
saying
that
any
child
born
abroad
of
american
parents
shall
become
a
citizen
at
the
age
of
10,
regardless
of
who
the...
which
parent
was
the...
the
male
or
female
parent?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
mr.
patterson,
on
that
line,
you
don't
take
issue
with
judge
wald's
statement,
do
you,
that
i
see
no
problem
with
the
requirement
that
a
u.s.
citizen
parent
take
some
action
to
acknowledge
parentage
or
responsibility
for
a
child
before
the
child
reaches
age
18?
if...
suppose
congress
said,
mothers,
fathers,
they're
both
parents,
and
if
a
child
is
born
abroad,
one
of
them
has
to
say,
i
will
take
responsibility
for
this
child
till
she's
18.
unknown
speaker
well--
--it's
interesting,
is
it
not,
that
from
1790
till
1934,
there
was,
as
i
understand
the
statutes,
no
way
that
a
mother
could
fit
under
them.
it
all
depended
on
fatherhood.
unknown
speaker
so
that
was
unconstitutional,
from--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
was
unconstitutional,
from
1796
to
whatever?
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
about
1790
to
1934,
and
under
the
precedent
that
then
existed--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
but
you're
still
talking
about
the
same
constitution.
unknown
speaker
mr.
patterson,
you
mentioned
a
moment
ago
that
the
way
you
view
the
relationship
between
1401
and
1409
is
that
1401
first
provides
citizenship
on
individuals
like
your
client,
and
then
1409
in
effect
takes
it
away,
but
that
does
not
seem
to
me
a
fair
characterization
of
the
statute,
because
1409,
in
its
subsection
(a)
seems
to
me
to
make
it
pretty
clear
that
1401
simply
does
not
apply
to
individuals
like
your
client
in
cases
of
illegitimacy
unless
certain
conditions
are
satisfied,
so
i
don't
see
how
you
can
start
your
argument
by
assuming
that
1401
gives
you
something
which
is
then
taken
away
on
a
disparate
criterion.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
the...
maybe
i
misunderstand
you,
but
i
think
that's
a
separate
argument.
i
thought
you...
the
question
was,
you
know,
how
do
you
get
into
court
in
the
first
place,
and
you
say,
well...
or
i
guess
the
question
was
on
deference,
and
you
say,
well,
the
deference
issue
is
different
here
because
my
client
in
effect
is
given
citizenship
to
begin
with,
so
that
she
starts
as
a
citizen
claimant
in
a
way
that
the
other
plaintiff
did
not.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
your
reason
for
that
is
the
provision
of
1401,
your
argument
fails,
because
1409
says
1401
doesn't
apply
unless
you
meet
these
conditions.
unknown
speaker
let
me
interrupt
you
there,
because
is
it
not
the
fact
that
most
of
the
cases
we're
concerned
with
probably
are
illegitimate
children
of
service
people
abroad,
and
isn't
it
also
a
fact
that
the
vast...
maybe
not
the
vast
majority,
but
the
preponderant
number
of
those
would
probably
be
of
a
male
parent
rather
than
a
female
parent?
unknown
speaker
and
isn't
it
also
true
that
at
the
time
of
birth,
when
it's
a
female
parent
there's
no
question
about
what's
going
to
happen
to
that
child,
whereas
at
the
time
of
birth
of
a
child
of
a
male
parent
by
a
female
alien,
when
the
male
parent
may
not
be
on
the
spot
at
all,
or
even
within
the
general
area,
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
that
have
to
be
resolved
in
the
future?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
13
percent
is
quite
different
from
87
percent.
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
and...
which
is
established
at
the
moment
of
birth,
no
matter
where
the
birth
takes
place,
if
there's
any
hospital
record
to
establish--
unknown
speaker
--with
regard
to
the
male
parent,
there
are
a
lot
of
questions
that
are
unanswered
at
the
time
of
birth.
unknown
speaker
they
cannot
be
established
as
promptly
in
the
routine
case
as
they
can
with
regard
to
the
woman,
if
you're
talking
about
situations
abroad
where
personnel
are
transferred
from
location
to
location
within
6-month
periods.
unknown
speaker
servicemen
being
overseas
and
shipped
back
to
this
country.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
that
it
would
be
fair
to
say
the
proof
must
be
submitted
within
36
hours
after
birth,
and
if
you
treat
both
sexes
equally,
the
only
requirement
is
that
parentage
must
be
established
within
the
first
2
weeks
after
birth?
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--you'd
have
many,
many
children
of
male,
unmarried
parents
who
would
not
be
able
to
comply
with
that
requirement.
unknown
speaker
but
only
in
one
way,
only
in
one
direction.
let
me
ask
you
this.
does
your
client
have
standing
to
assert
the
father's
gender
discrimination
claim?
unknown
speaker
i
hadn't
thought
so.
he
was
in
the
case
at
one
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
short
answer
is,
the
father
is
no
longer
before
us,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
does
this
petitioner,
can
she...
does
she
have
standing
to
raise
any
claims
that
he
might
raise
on
gender
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
when
the
government
moved
to
dismiss
the
father
and
then
coupled
that
with
a
motion
to
transfer
the
case
from
texas
to
the
district
of
columbia,
i
assume
that
if
the
government
thought
that
there
was
no...
well,
what
did
the
government
tell
the
district
court
in
texas
about
why
the
father
had
no
standing?
unknown
speaker
then
the
case
got
shipped
to
the
district
court
in
d.c.--
unknown
speaker
--was
there
an
effort
made
by
the
father
to
appeal
his
dismissal
from
the
case?
unknown
speaker
would
there
have
been
a...
the
problem
of
the
transfer
intervening,
where
would
the
father
have
brought
that
appeal?
once
the
case
is
shipped
out
of
the
district
court
in
texas,
they
lose...
that
circuit
loses
authority
over
it.
unknown
speaker
i'd
like
you
to
clarify
one
earlier
point,
because
there
were
references
to
many,
many
qualifications,
but
i
think...
am
i
right
about
this...
that
you
were
relying
at
least
alternately
on
the
prior
version
of
1409,
when
there
was
no
requirement
of
a
written
acknowledgement
of
support,
when
all
that
was
required
was
an
acknowledgement,
a
legitimation
of
the
child
by
the
father
saying
yes,
i
am
the
father.
there
was
not
this
additional
requirement,
as
there
is
now,
about
a
written
undertaking
to
support.
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
have
before
us
the
question
of
the
residency
requirement,
because
he
satisfies
that,
so
that's
an
academic
question.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
have
before
us
the
written
support
obligation,
because
that
wasn't
required
at
the
relevant
time.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
only
one--
unknown
speaker
--i
have
one--
--you're
relying
here
on
the
fourteenth
amendment,
which...
you
have
the
equal
protection
provision,
which
was
surely
directed
most
immediately
not
to
sex
discrimination
but
most
immediately
to
race
discrimination.
now,
congress,
however,
under
its
immigration
policies,
can
certainly
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
can't
it,
all
the
time?
i
mean,
it
says,
you
know,
you
can
immigrate
if
you're
coming
from
ireland,
but
not
if
you're
coming
from
italy
or
greece,
or
whatever.
it's
done
this
from
the
beginning.
that's
national
origin,
which--
--well,
okay.
--is
what
the
immigration
act
is
all
about.
just
a
minute.
let
him
answer
justice
scalia's
question.
i'm
sorry.
consider
it
race,
consider
it
national
origin,
whatever
you
want.
the
two
are--
unknown
speaker
--the
two
are
closely
allied,
and--
unknown
speaker
--much
closer
to
the
fourteenth
amendment
than
sex.
now,
how
can
it
be
that
congress
can
do
that?
could
congress
say
that
the
children
of
american
fathers
who
are
born
in,
let's
say,
somalia
can
immigrate
to
the
united
states
and
be
united
states
citizens,
but
those
children
of
american
fathers
born
in
ireland
cannot?
could
congress
say
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
everything
that's
wrong
is
not
necessarily
unconstitutional.
i
mean,
that's--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
patterson,
may
i
just
vary
my
colleague's
question
and
say,
suppose
congress
said
that
the
children
of
citizen
fathers...
citizen
fathers
who
are
caucasian
are
citizens
at
birth,
but
that
children
of
citizen
fathers
who
are
not
caucasian,
people
born
in
the
united
states,
fathers
born
in
the
united
states
but
not
caucasian,
the
children
of
those
fathers
born
abroad
shall
not
be
considered
citizens
at
birth?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that's
the
government's
argument
at
all.
they
have
not
argued
that
would
be
rational.
they
have
argued
there's
a...
there
are
good
reasons
for
the
distinction
in
this
case,
and
your
suggestion
is
there's
no
justification
for
differentiation
on
the
basis
of
the
sex
of
the
parent
in...
when
there's
an
illegitimate
birth.
that's
really
the
question
we
have.
unknown
speaker
but
you
surely
don't
have
to
take
it
to
that
extreme
to
try
and
figure
out
whether
there
is
some
sensible
basis
for
drawing
a
distinction
between
a
single
parent
abroad
in
the
military...
i
think
of
the
military
because
i
know
there
are
many,
many
cases
that
arise
this
way,
when
it's
the
mother
on
the
one
hand
and
when
it's
the
father
on
the
other.
it
seems
to
me
there
are
quite
obvious
differences,
and
i...
at
least
justifying
some
differential
in
treatment.
unknown
speaker
any
legitimate
person.
unknown
speaker
i
say,
congress
has
decided
that
any
person
born
legitimately
is
so
entitled.
that's
as
far
as
congress
has
gone.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
mother
has
lived
in
the
country
for
a
year.
let
me
go
to
that
point,
because
i
wanted
to
ask
you
this
question
anyway.
two
of
the
government's
justifications
for
drawing
the
distinction
that
it
draws
are
these.
one,
there
are
differences
in
problems
of
proof,
and
your
answer
to
that
is,
well,
in
this
day
of
genetic
testing,
those
problems
really
have
evaporated,
and
i'll
assume
that
for
the
moment.
the
second
major
justification
that
the
government
brings
up
is
that
there
is
a
difference,
depending
on
whether
the
single
citizen
parent
is
male
or
female,
depending...
which
affects
the
likelihood
of
the
attachment
of
the
child
to
the
country.
the
government
says,
look,
most
children
stay
with
their
mothers
when
they're
young,
just
as
a
matter
of
fact.
that's
the
way
it
happens.
if,
in
fact,
the
mother
is
a
citizen,
then
the
child
is
likely
to
be
in
the
company
of
an
american
citizen,
and
i
suppose
most
american
citizens
tend
to,
sooner
or
later,
come
back
to
the
united
states,
even
if
they
were
abroad
at
some
point.
so
the
government's
argument
is,
the
likelihood
is
that
the
child
who
is
born
to
the
female
citizen
will
in
fact,
because
of
the
mother's
company
and
because
of
the
mother's
probable
residence,
gain
an
attachment
to
the
united
states,
whereas
that
will
not
necessarily
be
so
if
in
fact
the
mother
is
an
alien
and
it's
the
father
who
in
justice
stevens'
example
comes
back
from
the
service
assignment
at
some
point.
is
there
something
unsound
factually
about
the
government's
argument,
and
is
there
something
illegitimate,
constitutionally,
to
the
government's
argument?
unknown
speaker
but
the
point
is
that
as
a
generalization,
the
attachment
will
exist
in
the
one
case,
and
as
a
generalization
it
will
not
exist
in
the
other.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that,
that
this
is
a--
unknown
speaker
--an
unconstitutional
stereotyping,
or
what?
is
it
true
or
false?
unknown
speaker
every
law
is
based
on
a
generalization.
you
really
want
us
to
adopt
the
proposition
that
congress
cannot
generalize
when
it
makes
laws?
unknown
speaker
it
may
not
be
archaic.
the...
i
think
the
classifications
this
court
was
confronted
with
in
the
frontiero
case,
in
the
wiesenfeld...
those
weren't
archaic.
they
did
represent
the
way
the
world
was
for
most
people.
most
men
supported
most
women,
and
yet
the
court
did
say
that
in
this
category
sex
discrimination,
you
could
not
rely
on
those
generally
true
propositions.
unknown
speaker
i
did
want
to
ask
one
question
about
this
statute
that
does
draw
a
distinction
that's
different
for
men
and
women.
that
is,
the
very
first
requirement,
that
blood
relationship
between
the
child
and
the
father
be
established
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
are
you
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
such
a
requirement?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
the
statute,
all
it
said
was
that.
that
was
the
only
distinction
that
was
drawn
on
the
basis
of
sex.
it
says,
in
the
case
of
the
father,
the
blood
relationship
must
be
established
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence.
unknown
speaker
i
have
one
question,
which
is
a
very
preliminary
nature.
i
take
it
as
a
general
rule
that
if
you're
a
person
outside
the
united
states
you
do
not
have
capacity
to
sue
for
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
and
this
is...
you
say
this
is
different
because
the
claim
at
issue
is
citizenship?
unknown
speaker
i
was
just
curious
to
know,
do
you
have
some
precedent
for
that?
unknown
speaker
but
rogers
v.
belli,
the
court
said
that
foreign-born
children
of
citizens
have
no
constitutional
right
to
citizenship.
we'd
have
to
disavow
that,
wouldn't
we?
it's
limited
at
least
to
the
soil
of
the
united
states
and
the
blood
of
the
united
states.
i
mean,
you're
either
applying
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
territory
or
on
the
basis
of
blood,
and--
--let
me
put
it--
--your
client
here
is
neither
on
the
territory
of
the
united
states
nor
a
united
states
citizen,
so
that
you
could
say
her
actions
are
governed
abroad
by
united
states
law.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
see,
there
there
was
a
citizen...
there
was
a
person
who
was
being
tried
in
a
united
states
criminal
court,
but
here
your
client
has
never
been
in
the
united...
for...
just
for
our
purposes,
at
this
time
the
suit
was
filed
was
outside
the
united
states.
well,
perhaps
the
government
will
address
that
briefly.
i
would
like
you
to,
because
i
thought
rogers
supported
you.
that
is,
i
thought
rogers
was
a
case
where
a
person
claimed
citizenship.
he
was
wrong
on
the
merits,
but
the
court
permitted
him
to
raise
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
because
had
he
won,
he
would
have
been
a
citizen.
unknown
speaker
and
there...
so
is...
but
don't
say
yes
if
i'm
not
right,
because...
because
it
won't
do
any
good.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
so
rogers
is
the
precedent,
you
say?
unknown
speaker
and
you're
still
relying
on
the
third
party
standing
that
you
cited
craig
v.
boren,
that
if
the
beer
seller
could
raise
the
boy's
equal
protection
rights,
then
the
daughter
can
raise
her
father's
rights.
unknown
speaker
you
have
no
time
left.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
--mr.
kneedler,
why
did
the
government
move
to
dismiss
the
father
when
he
was
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
if
fiallo
was
controlling,
it
should
have
been
controlling
on
her
claim
as
well
as
his,
so
it's
a
little
odd
that
the
government
moved
only
to
dismiss
him.
unknown
speaker
and
not
her.
unknown
speaker
and
third
party
standing.
unknown
speaker
but
the
government...
if
the
government's
position
was
fiallo
v.
bell,
then
it's
very
difficult
to
understand
why
it
didn't...
they
didn't
do
that
across
the
board.
they
chose
to
do
it
only
with
respect
to
the
father
and
with
respect
to
her
said
she
has
no
third
party
standing.
unknown
speaker
but
it
is
sort
of
ironic.
the
government
argued
he
didn't
have
standing,
it
was
her
claim,
and
here
you're
arguing
that
she
doesn't
have
standing,
it's
his
claim.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
little
hard
to
swallow.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
just
that
you
refer
to
the
texas
proceeding?
what
evidence
was
taken
on
the
issue
of
parentage?
was
it
just
his
testimony?
unknown
speaker
how
was
his...
how
do
we
know
he's
the
real
father?
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler--
--he
had
much
more,
though.
he
is
the...
he
has
become
a
legitimate
father,
has
he
not?
unknown
speaker
but
then
we
take--
--just
before
we
get
to--
--yes.
i'm
sorry.
just
one
more
moment
on
the
standing
and
the
transfer.
how
would
the
father,
or
where
would
the
father
have
appealed
that
dismissal?
the
case
had
been
transferred
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia.
there
was
the
father,
left
at
the
post
back
in
texas.
where
would
he...
where
would
that...
his
appeal
go?
unknown
speaker
in
the
district
of
columbia?
unknown
speaker
because
my
understanding
was
that
once
the
case
gets
transferred,
the
transferor
court
loses
authority
over
it.
unknown
speaker
you
ordinarily
would
get
60
days
if
the
government's
on
the
other
side.
how
much
time
did
he
have
between
when
the
case
was
ordered
transferred
and
when
it
left
texas
and
went
to
the
district
of
columbia?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
have
shortened
what
is
the
usual
time
one
has.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
want
to
delay
you
any
longer
in
getting
to
the
merits,
subject
to
one
question.
rogers
v.
belli,
is
that
the
precedent
that
we
look
to
to
see
that
this
petitioner
has
standing
to
invoke
the
assistance
of
the
federal
courts
when
she's...
and
of
the
constitution
when
she
is
outside
the
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
and
she
says
she's
a
citizen
by
virtue
of
1401,
and
you
say
well,
that
can't
be
until
you
knock
out
1409,
and
you
can't
do
that
because--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
mean,
that's
her
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
do
you...
when
this
case
began,
at
least,
the
petitioner
here
was
outside
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states.
do
you
take
the
position
that
she
was
a
person
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
for
bringing
the
equal
protection
kind
of
claim
that
she
brings
at
that
time?
unknown
speaker
didn't
johnson
v.
eisentrager
make
a
distinction
between
one
who
was
an
alien
and,
i
think
the
words
of
the
decision
were,
if
a
person
makes
a
claim
to
u.s.
citizenship,
and
distinguish
the
person
who
said,
i'm
an
alien
and
would
like
the
opportunity
to
become
a
u.s.
citizen,
and
someone
who
was
making
a
claim
to
u.s.
citizenship.
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
can
i--
--is
there
anything...
i
take
it
there's
nothing
peculiar
about
the
equal
protection
nature
of
the
claim
that
she's
bringing
that
you
invoke
to
support
your
position
that
she's
not
a
person.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
i
ask
the
question,
i
mean,
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
it
refers
to
the...
to
persons
within
the
jurisdiction,
so
i
suppose
you
would
be
making
the
argument,
if
this
were
somehow
a
claim
against
a
state,
that
she
would
not,
as
an
alien
living
abroad,
be
such
a
person
for
that
peculiar
reason,
and
that's
not
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
a
question
on
the
merits?
unknown
speaker
i've
two
questions,
actually,
on
the
merits,
and
what
i'm
thinking
of
is
not
the
problem
of
proving
paternity.
i'm
assuming
that
out
with
genetic
testing.
perhaps
it's
the
same.
assume
that's
so.
you
have
a
separate
argument
that
i
think
justice
souter
addressed
earlier,
and
it's
on
pages
25,
26,
27,
28
of
your
brief,
and
basically
you're
arguing,
i
think,
that
there
is
more
likely
to...
you
want
a
substantial
tie
with
the
parent.
unknown
speaker
a
substantial
tie,
or
something
like
that,
a
personal
tie,
and
that's
more
likely
to
be
there
in
the
mind
run
of
cases
with
the
mother
than
it
is
with
the
father,
and
that's
why
we
need
the
extra
proof.
unknown
speaker
that's
the
argument
i'm
thinking
of.
unknown
speaker
basically.
and
i
thought
at
first
that's
a
pretty
good
argument,
and
then
i
realized
that
the
reason
i'm
thinking
that
is
in
my
mind
i'm
dividing
parents
into
caretaker
parents
and
noncaretaker
parents,
and
that
argument
makes
a
lot
of
sense
if
you
compare
the
noncaretaker
citizen
father
with
the
caretaker
citizen
mother.
of
course
it's
true
then.
it's
true
by
definition.
5
minutes
before
the
patient
died
he
was
still
alive.
but
suppose
you
switch
to
what
i'd
think
would
be
the
relevant
comparisons.
those
are
my
two
questions.
first
let's
think
of
the
noncaretaker
parents
who
are
both
citizens.
they're
in
the
united
states,
the
baby's
over
in
the
philippines,
and
my
first
question
is,
why
is
there
any
reason
in
the
world
to
believe
that
a
noncaretaker
father
has
less
of
a
personal
tie
than
a
noncaretaker
mother
who's
abandoned
the
child?
and
now
my
second
question
looks
at
it
just
the
other
way.
let's
imagine
now
that
both
citizens
are
caretakers,
and
what
reason
in
the
world
is
there
to
think
that
a
caretaker
mother
has
more
of
a
connection
with
the
child
than
a
caretaker
father,
who
after
all
is
trying
to
bring
up
the
child
by
himself?
now,
those
seem
to
me
to
be
the
two
relevant
comparisons,
and
as
soon
as
i
think
of
those
comparisons,
it
seems
to
me
this
distinction
is
irrational,
or
close
to
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
you
to
respond.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
kneedler,
i
understand
that
very
well
with
respect
to
your
first
criterion,
where
you
say
you
can't
claim
father
status
unless
you
show
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
you
are
the
father.
but
for
the
rest,
for
the
life
of
me...
if
you're
going
to
say,
yes,
only
the
woman
can
bear
the
child,
there's
no
doubt
that
men
will
never
be
able
to
have
that
great
joy,
but--
[laughter]
--just
as
only
women
can
bear
children,
so
both
parents
can
care
for
children,
and
increasingly
fathers
are
beginning
to
recognize
the
joy
and
the
obligation
of
parenthood.
so
your
division
for
purpose
of,
am
i
a
parent,
i
understand
that,
but
after
the
birth,
and
after
the
paternity
is
established,
the
rest
of
it,
just
as
in
justice
breyer's
case,
i
have
great
difficulty
following.
unknown
speaker
accepting
that
standard
as
a
legal
standard,
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
lawyer
talk.
clear
and
convincing
evidence
that
he's
the
father,
that's
a
legal
standard,
and
that
relates
to
birth,
who
is
the
parent
of
this
newborn
child.
after
that
this
talks
about
written
obligation,
written
undertaking
to
support,
all
that,
and
why
is
that
only
one
way,
and
i
would
like
to
ask
in
that
connection
whether
the
government
is
now
retreating
from
something
it
told
the
court
just
2
years
ago
over
and
over
again,
i
think
to
the
annoyance
of
some
people
because
it
was
repeated
so
often
at
the
oral
argument
and
in
the
brief.
the
government
said
in
the
university
of
virginia,
united
states
v.
virginia
said,
differences
in
treatment
based
on
sex
are
suspect.
even
when
stereotypes
reflect
current
realities,
courts
have
condemned
them
because
the
law
must
not
restrict
men
and
women
by
reflecting
and
reinforcing
patterns
of
historic
discrimination.
the
government
said
that
over
and
over.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
if
you
would
answer
the
question
that
was
asked
before
in
the
context
of
not
national
origin,
but
race.
suppose
the
united
states
took
the
position,
we
know
as
a
matter
of
statistics
that
there
are
many
more
white
fathers
that
take
responsibility
for
their
children
than
nonwhite
fathers.
therefore,
we're
going
to
have
this
written
acknowledgement
of
an
obligation
to
support.
that
will
be
required
of
citizen
fathers
who
are
nonwhite,
but
not
citizen
fathers
who
are
white,
and
we're
basing
that
on
solid,
empirical
evidence
of
who
provides
support
for
children.
would
that
be
constitutional
because
it's
in
the
immigration
and
nationality
area?
unknown
speaker
but
you...
compelling
justification
doesn't
fit
with--
unknown
speaker
--the
justification
is
the
practical
one
that
i
gave
you,
the
statistics
will
show
that
disproportionately
nonwhite
fathers
don't
accept
the
support
obligation.
unknown
speaker
let's
go
to
the
emblematic
issue,
because
that's
part
of
your
argument
with
the
converse
argument
with
respect
to
the
more
lenient
treatment
of
the
child
of
the
citizen
mother.
one
step
in
that
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
because
the
mother
is
the
citizen,
the
child
will
be
with
the
mother,
the
mother
has
an
attachment
to
the
united
states,
therefore
ultimately
that
will
foster
an
attachment
of
the
child
to
the
united
states.
my
question
is,
should
we
take
that
argument
seriously
when
in
fact
the
statute
requires
of
the
citizen's
mother
that
she
have
an
attachment
only
to
the
extent
of
once
at
any
time
having
lived
for
1
year
prior
to
birth
in
the
united
states?
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
be
a
criterion
that
calls
for
very
much
sense
of
attachment
and
if,
in
fact,
that's
the
low
value
that
the
united
states
is
willing
to
put
on
this
attachment
concept,
isn't
the
argument
a
very
weak
argument,
if
not
perhaps
a
sham?
unknown
speaker
is
that
on
record
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
can
i
find
that
reasoning
somewhere
in
the
legislative
history?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
the
cite?
i
didn't
remember
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
if
you
don't
have
it
right
at
hand,
i
don't
want
to
take
your
time
looking
for
it.
unknown
speaker
okay.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
by
the
same
token,
if
this
child
had
in
fact
lived
with
her
father,
suppose
he
went...
took
him...
took
a
ship,
took
her
back
to
the
united
states,
she's
a
teenager,
she
proves
to
be
trouble,
so
he
says,
out
with
you,
back,
i
don't
want
anything
to
do
with
you.
she
would
have
had
all
her
growing
up
years
in
the
united
states
and
yet,
under
this
statute,
she
could
not
qualify
as
the
child
of
a
u.s.
born
citizen.
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
asking
the
question
about
the
tie
to
the
united
states,
so
that
becomes
irrelevant.
even
though
this
child
grew
up
in
the
united
states,
that's--
unknown
speaker
--in
social
and
economic
legislation,
too.
see,
that's
really
the
problem
that
i
have
with
it.
it
used
to
be
for
years
and
years
social
and
economic
legislation
is
anything
goes,
what
congress
wants
to
do,
and
yet
all
the
precedent
in
the
gender
cases
were
made
in
that
area
which
traditionally
has
been
a
largely
judicial
hands-off,
so
i'm
frankly
puzzled
about
why
the
government,
after
saying
all
gender
classifications
are
subject
to
heightened
scrutiny,
now
says
we
found
an
exception,
so
i'd
like
to
know,
are
there
other
exceptions?
