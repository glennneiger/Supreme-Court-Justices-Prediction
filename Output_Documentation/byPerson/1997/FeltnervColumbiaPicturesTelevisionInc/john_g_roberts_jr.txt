mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
this
case,
a
district
judge
determined
that
mr.
feltner
should
pay
columbia
pictures
8.8
million
in
statutory
damages
for
a
copyright
infringement.
before
arriving
at
that
figure,
the
judge
held
a
bench
trial,
after
which
he
made
the
factual
finding
that
mr.
feltner's
conduct
was
willful,
which
increased
the
amount
of
damages
which
could
be
awarded
under
the
statute.
in
light
of
clear
historical
practice
on
both
sides
of
the
atlantic
prior
to
1971,
feltner
had
a
right
under
the
seventh
amendment
to
have
a
jury
make
that
finding
and
others
on
which
the
award
was
based
and
determine
the
amount
of
damages
to
be
imposed
within
the
statutory
limits.
before
reaching
that
constitutional
question,
however,
we
need
to
consider
whether
the
statute
may
be
construed
to
afford
a
jury
trial
right.
it
may
be.
first,
the
first
federal
statute
providing
statutory
damages
in
an
amount
"as
to
the
court
shall
appear
to
be
just.
"
the
1856
act,
also
provided
that
those
damages
should
be
recovered
in
an
action
on
the
case,
a
prototypical
legal
action
for
which
a
jury
would
be
available.
statutory
damages
as
to
the
court
shall
appear
to
be
just,
the
samel
terminology
as
employed
in
the
1856
act,
were
carried
forward
in
successive
acts
up
to
the
1909
act,
when
the
statutory
damages
provision
took
its
modern
form,
with
no
indication
that
congress
wanted
to
delete
the
jury
trial
right
that
was
so
clearly
present
in
1856.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
certainly--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
it
has
been...
it
was
expanded
significantly
in
1909.
the
range
was
expanded
and
the
1856
act
applied
to
dramatic
compositions.
the
1909
act
applied
more
generally.
but
that
same
language,
as
to
the
court
shall
appear
to
be
just,
carried
through
all
the
different
statutory
provisions.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
right.
that's
one
of
the
distinctions
added
in
1909
from
the
1856
act.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
a
false
problem.
it's
never
been
a
problem
in
the
courts
that
have
recognized
the
jury
trial
right
so
far.
all
the
judge
needs
to
do--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
don't
think
so.
all
the
judge
needs--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--to
do
is
to
say
to
the
plaintiff,
when
the
jury
comes
back,
i'm
going
to
enter
judgment
promptly
upon
their
verdict
and
therefore
they'll
be
there.
if
the
plaintiff
says
i
want
to
elect
statutory
damages--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
jury
would
not
have
been
sent
home
by
that
point.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
jury
would
be
instructed
according
to
the
factors
it's
supposed
to
consider,
as
juries
are,
for
example,
in
awarding
punitive
damages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
courts
have
developed
guidelines
of
what
is
appropriate
to
consider,
whether
it's
a
jury
or
a
judge,
in
awarding
statutory
damages,
the
amount
of
loss,
the
value
of
the
copyright,
profits--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
just
as
with
the
case
of
punitive
damages,
which
is
an
amount
of
damages
left
largely
to
the
discretion
of
the
jury,
there
have
developed
instructions
as
to
the
factors
they
should
consider,
and
likewise--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
true
whether
a
jury
or
a
judge
is
making
that
initial
determination,
so
that
concern
i
think
doesn't
really
cut
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
question
of
whether--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
jury
or
the
judge
reaches
that
conclusion.
they
are
unusual
in
that
respect.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
holding
in
tull
is
first
of
all
that
that
is
a
legal
action,
the
civil
penalty
action.
the
court
analogized
to
civil
penalty
actions
in
the
eighteenth
century,
said
they
were
legal,
noted
that
the
nature
of
the
remedy,
punishment
was
legal,
and
then
at
the
very
end
said,
but
the
actual
amount
is
for
the
judge.
now,
here--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--if
it
is
true
here,
then
the
judgment
needs
to
be
reversed
because,
of
course,
this
judge
didn't
just
determine
the
amount
of
damages.
he
made
a
factual
finding
of
willfulness
under
the
statute.
that's
something
that
if
this
is
a
legal
action--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
is
a
discretionary
element
and
tull,
i
think,
should
be
limited
to
the
civil
penalty
context
in
which
it
arose
for
a
number
of
reasons,
first
of
all
because
that
aspect
of
the
holding
was
dicta
in
tull
as
a
technical
matter.
the
question
of
who
should
determine
damages
wasn't
before
the
court,
because
the
court
had
reversed
on
liability.
it
may
not
have
been
necessary
to
reach
that
question
at
all.
that's
a
technical
point.
but
the
more
substantive
one
is
that
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
briefing
in
tull,
it
was
devoted
almost
exclusively
to
the
question
of
liability,
very
little
discussion
of
the
question
of
damages
at
all
and,
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
respect
to
civil
penalties
prior
to
1791,
when
damages
were
not
fixed,
juries
decided
damages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
distinction--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
distinction
goes
back
to
the
18th
century
practice
in
england.
when
damages
were
not
fixed,
juries
set
the
amount
of
damages,
so
if
congress
has
not
fixed
the
amount
of
damages
in
a
copyright
action,
they
should
be
set
by
juries
under
this
court's
precedent.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
don't
think
there
was
any
evidence
of
juries--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
they--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
part
of
it,
and
also
in
the
civil
penalty
action
you
have
an
analogy
to
criminal
sentencing
where
a
judge
determines
the
sentencing.
that
analogy
doesn't
apply
in
this
case
because
this
is
a
private
right...
it's
not
a
public
right...
a
private
action
between
two
parties
and
the
core
of
the
analysis,
though,
although
i
think
tull
can
be
limited
in
that
way
and
its
statement
is
dicta,
the
core
of
the
analysis
shouldn't
be
extended
because
it
can't
be
defended.
the
idea
that
although
congress
fixed
the...
when
congress
fixes
the
amount
of
the
penalty
it
can
therefore
delegate
that
task
to
judges
ignores
the
whole
purpose
of
the
seventh
amendment.
the
seventh
amendment
is
to
protect
against
judicial
bias
and
corruption
and
overreaching
and,
while
that's
not
implicated
when
congress
fixes
the
amount
because
congress
is
doing
that,
the
judge
is
just
applying
it,
when
you
give
that
task
to
the
judge
the
whole
reason
for
having
the
seventh
amendment
comes
into
play,
so
that
logic
in
tull,
i
think,
should
at
the
very
least
not
be
extended
any
further.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
jury,
cert
jury.
we've
cited
cases
to
that
effect
i
believe
on
page
43
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
very
confusing.
he
did
not.
at
the
start
of
the
bench
trial
he
said
that
the
issues
remaining
for
trial
were
how
many
infringements
were
involved
and
were
they
willful,
and
what
should
the
damages
be,
so
at
the
very
outset
at
least,
he
thought
that
was
an
issue
for
trial.
later
on,
he
also
said
he
wanted
to
hear
about
how
many
infringements
were
involved.
later
on,
he
said
he
was
ruling
on
it
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
it's
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
it
depends...
and
the
legal
standard
was
correctly
stated.
it
depends
upon
whether
each
episode
has
what's
called
an
independent
copyright
life,
an
independent
economic
value,
and
that's
a
question
of
fact.
you
take
evidence
on
that.
how
was
it
copyrighted?
how
was
it
produced?
how
was
it
marketed?
would
the
television
station
show
just
one
episode
of
a
series
or
not?
there
are
factual
issues
involved
in
that
and
then
a
legal
standard
to
be
applied,
and
we
think
what
should
have
happened
is
that
the
jury
should
have
been
able
to
determine
those
facts
based
on
proper
instructions
of
the...
what
the
legal
test
was.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
just
a
question
of
whether
they
were
separate
entities,
but
whether
they
were
jointly
and
severally
responsible
for
the
infringement,
because
the
statute
allows
only
one
award
of
statutory
damage
for
all
individual
or
joint
and
several
infringements
of
each
work.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
that...
those
should
have
been
submitted
to
the
jury
and,
as
i
say,
there's
some
confusion
as
to
what
he
did.
it's
hard
to
tell.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
normal
rules--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
normal
rules
about
directing
verdicts
and
taking
issues
away
from
juries
i
think
apply.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
infringement
was
settled
on--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--on
summary
judgment.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
was
not
in
this
case.
i
do
think
it's
difficult
to
tell
when
you
have
the
judge
acting
both
as
factfinder
and
as
ruler
of
law
when
he's
saying
based
on
these
facts
i'm
making
this
decision,
or
i'm
making
this
decision
as
a
matter
of
law
and
it's
also
difficult,
when
that
same
judge
has
made
a
ruling
on
summary
judgment,
to
tell,
is
he
saying
based
on
the
evidence
at
trial,
or
i
saw
this
evidence
before
on
summary
judgment.
so
there
is
some
ambiguity
in
the
record,
but
i
think
the
jury
should
have
been
instructed
on
the
number
of
infringements,
as
the
judge
indicated
was
an
issue
available
for
trial
at
the
outset.
and
the
court
of
appeals
seemed
to
think
that
that
was
decided
at
least
as
a
mixed
question.
it
referred
to
the
judge's
findings
and
whether
or
not
they
were
erroneous,
rather
than
treating
it
as
a
legal
ruling.
now,
the
first
step
in
this
court's
constitutional
approach
is
to
find
an
analogue
to
this
action
in
18th
century
practice
and
ask
whether
that's
legal
or
equitable.
the
analogue
to
modern
actions
for
statutory
damages
for
copyright
infringement
is
the
18th
century
action
for
statutory
damages
for
copyright
infringement
under
the
statute
of
anne,
under
the
first
federal
copyright
statute
passed
1
year
before
the
seventh
amendment
by
the
same
congress
that
passed
the
seventh
amendment,
and
those
statutes
provided
for
recovery
of
amounts
and
specified
that
they
should
be
recovered
in
an
action
at
law.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
he
had
to
go
in
a
separate
proceeding
at
law
to
get
damages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
in
equity,
no.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--millar
v.
taylor
i
think
is
the
best
that
i
can
come
up
with,
which
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--after
the
seventh
amendment
was
adopted.
it
discusses
the
history.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
overruled
by
the
house
of
lords
in
donaldson
but
not
on
that
question.
it
was
the
question
of
whether
common
law
copyright
survived
the
statute
of
anne.
another
thing
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--up
until
beacon
theatres
and
dairy
queen.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
under
the
cleanup
doctrine,
but
in
beacon
theatres
the
court
noted
that
that
could
not
be
used
to
deprive
a
party
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial.
now--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
right,
that
ruling
on
the
injunctive
aspects
couldn't
deprive
a
litigant
of
his
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
the
legal
aspects,
and
the
legal
aspects
plainly
included
the
right
to
statutory
damages.
now,
the
statutory
damages
have
changed
since
then,
as
was
pointed
out.
the
main
difference
is
the
modern
version
gives
you
a
range,
and
these
18th
century
precedents
we've
been
talking
about
are
primarily
fixed
amounts.
that
is
not
a
distinction
that
makes
a
difference.
the
government
made
that
same
argument
in
the
tull
case
in
footnote
7.
it
said
those
18th
century
civil
penalty
actions
were
for
fixed
amounts
and
this,
the
clean
water
act
is
for
a
discretionary
range.
the
exact
words
of
this
court
are,
we
do
not
find
that
distinction
to
be
significant.
in
addition,
there
were
statutory
damages--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--sets
the--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--but
the
argument
in--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--in
tull
was,
because
congress
had
fixed
the
amounts
earlier
they
could
delegate
that
to
a
judge.
here
you
had
in
the
18th
century
fixed
amounts
under
the
statute
of
anne,
under
the
first
federal
copyright
statute,
but
also
a
situation
where
you
could
get
damages
for
copyright
infringement
that
weren't
fixed
by
congress
and
whenever
they
were
not
fixed
by
congress,
those
were
for
a
jury.
i
don't
know
that
that
situation
was
replicated
with
respect
to
the
civil
penalty
actions
of
the
sort
at
issue
in
tull.
and
it's
also
the
case
here
we
had
18th
century
preseventh
amendment
statutes
providing
for
a
range
of
statutory
damages.
statutes
in
massachusetts,
new
hampshire,
and
rhode
island
provided
for
the
recovery
of
statutory
damages
within
a
broad
range,
so
therefore
that
basic
distinction,
the
difference
between
fixed
and
range,
doesn't
make
a
difference
with
respect
to
characterizing
the
action.
the
second
step
in
this
court's
constitutional
analysis
is
to
look
to
the
nature
of
the
remedy.
here,
the
remedy
is
money
damages,
the
hallmark
of
legal
relief,
and
this
court
has
said
that
monetary
damages
are
legal
and
require
a
jury
except
in
two
very
specific,
defined
circumstances,
when
they
constitute
restitution
or
disgorgement,
and
when
they're
incidental
to
or
intertwined
with
equitable
relief.
the
first
certainly
doesn't
apply
here.
restitution
is
one
of
the
factors
that
the
jury
can
consider
in
setting
the
amount
of
damages,
but
it's
not
the
only
one.
they
also
can
look
at
punishment
and
compensation,
traditional
legal
remedies,
and
those
legal
remedies
give
the
right
to
a
jury.
again,
this
is
another
argument
that
was
made
in
tull.
the
government
argued
there
the
purpose
of
the
clean
water
act
penalties
is
restitution.
therefore,
this
is
equitable.
the
court
said
no,
the
purpose
is
also
punishment.
punishment
was
one
of
the
purposes.
that's
a
legal
remedy
and
therefore
this
is
a
legal
action.
the
modern
statutory
damages
serve
the
legal
purposes
of
punishment
and
compensation.
you
can
see
the
punishment
aspect
in
the
fact
that
you
get
a
broader...
a
higher
range
for
willful,
a
lower
range
for
innocent.
you
can
see
the
compensatory
aspect
in
the
fact
that
these
damages
are
instead
of
actual
damages.
you
don't
get
both
because
they
serve
the
same
purpose,
provide
some
recompense
for
the
copyright
holder.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that
is
the
basic
prerequisite
for
equitable
relief
and
it's
not
specified
here.
here,
statutory
damages
are
available
at
the
election
of
the
plaintiff
for
whatever
reason
or
no
reason.
he
does
not
have
to
show
that
legal...
actual
damages
or
legal
remedies
are
inadequate.
second
of
all,
the
fact
that
that's
one
of
the
reasons
you
have
this
relief
doesn't
make
it
equitable.
parties
frequently
provide
liquidated
damages
in
contracts
because
they
think
it
will
be
difficult
to
prove
actual
damages.
if
you
sue
for
liquidated
damages
in
a
contract
it's
still
a
legal
action
for
which
a
jury
is
required.
that's
the
reason
you
had
the
fixed
penalties
in
the
statute
of
anne,
because
actual
damages
were
difficult
to
calculate
and
yet
the
respondent
agrees
that
that
was
a
legal
action
to
recover
those
damages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
main
distinction
is
that
tull--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--tull
is
a...
tull
first
of
all
is
an
action
by
the
government
for
civil
penalties.
this
is
an
action
between
private
parties
for
damages.
at
common
law,
when
damages
were
not
fixed,
as
they're
not
here,
juries
determined
the
amount
of
damages,
whatever
may
have
been
the
case
with
respect
to
civil
penalties.
in
tull,
i
think--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
difference
is
that
under
tull
and
the
clean
water
act
the
court
couldn't...
wasn't
provided
with
and
didn't
find
any
analogies
in
the
18th
century
where
there
was
a
similar
range
and
you
got
a
jury.
here
we
have
that.
the
three
state
statutes
i
mentioned
provided
a
range
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
seventh
amendment
and
they
said,
you
recover
this
range
in
an
action
of
debt,
an
action
at
law.
so
whatever
may
be
the
case,
and
under
the
seventh
amendment
you
need
to
look
at
the
particular
actions
and
the
historical
analogues,
whatever
may
be
the
case
with
respect
to
civil
penalties,
the
analogue
here
is
there
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
seventh
amendment
and
it
was
an
action
at
law.
but
with
those
distinctions
of
tull
in
mind,
again,
the
basic
core
of
the
reasoning
should
not
be
extended.
when
damages
were
uncertain,
that
was
when
the
juries
were
needed
most.
this
court
said
so
in
barry
v.
edmunds.
where
no
precise
rule
of
law
fixes
the
reasonable
damages,
it
is
the
peculiar
function
of
the
jury
to
determine
the
amount.
that
was
the
rule
at
common
law,
lord
townshend's
case,
the
jury
are
judges
of
the
damages,
and
that
is
what
this
court
held
with
respect
to
the
seventh
amendment
consistently,
at
least
prior
to
tull.
that's
why
we
don't
have
additur
or
unconditional
remittitur,
because
it's
for
the
jury
to
determine
the
amount
of
damages.
that's
the
rationale
in
chief
justice
marshall's
opinion
in
bank
of
hamilton.
the
statute
there
said
you
could
be
evicted,
but
you
were
entitled
to
compensation
for
improvements,
improvements
will
be
set
by
commissioners,
unconstitutional
under
the
seventh
amendment.
juries
set
the
amount
of
damages.
now,
that
body
of
precedent
with
respect
to
damages
is
wellestablished.
the
body
of
precedent
with
respect
to
civil
penalties
may
well
be
different,
but
the
court
noted
in
tull,
for
example,
that
it
had
been
presented
with
no
evidence
that
the
framers
were
concerned
that
the
jury
trial
right
extend
to
the
question
of
remedy,
and
that's
right.
if
you
go
back
and
read
the
briefs,
the
evidence
isn't
there,
but
the
evidence
is
there
in
the
real
world.
the
amount
of
damages
was
a
critical
component
of
the
jury
trial
right.
the
episode
in
new
york
in
1764
that
figured
in
the
ratification
debates
involved
solely
a
redetermination
of
the
amount
of
damages
set
by
the
jury.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
that
point--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that
point,
but
also
another
one,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
that
is
that
there
are
other
situations
where
damages
for
copyright
infringement
were
not
set.
for
example,
if
you're
seeking
damages
with
respect
to
an
unpublished
work,
then
a
jury
would
determine
those
amounts.
under--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--under
section
504(b)
if
you're
seeking
actual
damages
a
jury
would
determine
that
amount.
there
are
situations
where
the
damages
are
not
fixed
and
in
those
cases
there's
no
question
that
it
would
be
for
a
jury
to
determine,
so
whatever
the
force
of
tull
with
respect
to
civil
penalties,
they
don't
apply
to
the
copyright
infringement
area.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
believe
that
the
action
for
damages
had
to
be
filed
separately
in
a
court
of
law.
it
couldn't
be
joined
with
the
equitable
action
for
an
injunction.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
beacon
theatres
and
dairy
queen
pointed
out
the
flaw
with
that
line
of
reasoning,
which
is
it
was
depriving
the
parties
of
their
right
to
a
jury
trial
through
the
conduct
of
the
litigation
and
you
could
not
go
and
get
both
in
a
single
action
in
equity
in
england.
now,
with...
the
state
precedent
here
i
don't
think
should
be
dismissed
as
simply
the
american
practice
as
opposed
to
the
english
practice.
the
court
is
concerned
about
looking
to
practice
here
because
they
don't
want
to
rely
on
idiosyncratic
practice,
but
there's
no
evidence
here
that
the
statutes
in
new
hampshire
and
massachusetts
were
in
any
way
inconsistent
with
english
common
law.
there
were
three
of
them,
which
suggests
that
they
were
not
aberrational
at
all
and
the
language
was
perfectly
consistent
with
all
the
other
statutes
that
were
provided
at
that
time,
all
of
which
providing
relief
at
law,
with
the
difference
that
they
provided
it
within
a
range.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
it
did
originate
in
england.
i
don't
know
when.
but
again,
my
reading
of
millar
v.
taylor
is
that
you
couldn't
get
damages
for
copyright
infringement
in
an
action
brought
at
equity.
you
could
get
your
injunction,
then
if
you
wanted
damages
you
went
in
a
separate
action
at
law.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
if
i
could
reserve
the
remainder--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
justice
souter,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
juries
at
common
law
returned
general
verdicts
for
an
amount.
they
didn't
say
50
sheets,
go
do
the
math.
the
citations
are
collected
at
page
43
of
our
brief.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
sure.
now,
it's
a
calculation,
but
they
did
the
calculation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
no,
at
least
not
under
those
where
the
amount
was
fixed.
it
was
under
the
statutes
in
new
hampshire
and
massachusetts
and
rhode
island.
justice
kennedy,
a
better
citation
than
the
one
i
gave
you
is
on
page
35
of
our
brief,
the
colburn
case,
saying
the
court
in
equity
doesn't
award
anything
beyond
the
accounting,
so
damages
beyond
restitution
would
not
be
allowed.
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
willfulness
determination
here
was
critical
to
the
judgment.
the
district
court
noted
the
range
for
willful
infringements
before
imposing
his
award.
columbia
argued
that
the
court
should
award
a
higher
award.
they
said,
just
40,000
per
infringement
and
that's
less
than
half
the
amount
you
can
award,
what
they
said
and,
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals
in
upholding
the
amount
emphasized
that
the
infringements
were
willful
and
the
20,000
figure
was
well
within
the
statutory
range.
now,
to
focus
for
a
moment
on
the
third
point
in
tull,
the
damages
question.
if
this
is
a
legal
action,
issues
of
infringement,
number
of
works,
willfulness
have
to
be
tried
to
the
jury
and
tull
is
the
only
impediment
to
the
conclusion
that
damages
also
are
for
the
jury.
tull
proceeds
along
the
assumption
that,
although
the
framers
were
willing
to
take
up
arms
over
the
issue
of
whether
a
judge
or
a
jury
decides
liability,
they
didn't
care
one
way
or
another
whether
the
judge
or
the
jury
said
200
dollars
or
100,000
dollars.
the
proposition
simply
makes
no
sense.
the
amount
of--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
i
think
tull
can
be
confined
to
the
civil
penalty
context
in
which
it
arose
and
the
particular
history
in
which
it
arose.
in
other
words,
the
historical
fact
about
civil
penalties
as
opposed
to
damages.
but
we
know
that
damages
were
set
by
the
jury
when
they
were
not
fixed,
regardless
of
the
case
with
respect
to
civil
penalties.
thank
you,
your
honor.
