justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
comment
on
mr.
roberts'
response
to
that,
that
the
same
problem
applies
when
the
judge
tries
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the...
mr.
roberts
suggested
in
response
to
this
argument
that
you
can
unring
the
bell
even
if
you
don't
have
a
jury.
i
mean,
you
can
ask
the
judge
to
take
a
second
look,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
that
if
the
judge
has
already
determined
actual
damages
it
would
be
too
late
to
unring
the
bell.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you...
i
had
the
same
problem
justice
breyer
asked
you
about.
i
understand
you
just
represent
one
client
in
this
case
and
the
irony
of
it
is,
maybe...
you
may
be
better
off
if
you
lose,
because
a
jury
may
come
in
with
a
bigger
award.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
certainly
won't.
[laughter]
i
certainly
won't,
but
it's
ironic...
or
the
other
way
around.
they...
there
may
be
a
crossverdict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
have
to
try
the
case
over.
no,
i
understand
that.
but
it
is
puzzling
to
me
as
to
why,
because
of
the
position
filed
by
the
amici,
why
this
class
of
plaintiffs
is
afraid
of...
seems
to
disapprove
of
juries
whereas
the
plaintiff
generally
would
seem
to
prefer
juries.
is
there
anything
about
copyright
law
that
suggests
why
that
should
develop?
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
much
human
interest
in
it
at
all,
is
there?
[laughter]
