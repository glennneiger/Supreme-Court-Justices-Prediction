justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
roberts,
in
this
case
on
that
very
point
that
was
the
one
piece
of
it
that
i
noticed...
and
you
said
willful
or
not
goes
to
the
jury
and
how
much
goes
to
the
jury,
but
in
this
case,
it
may
not
be
the
case
generally,
it
seems
to
me
that
how
many
infringements
was
ruled
on
as
a
matter
of
law.
didn't
the
judge
rule
on
it
even
before
his
bench
trial?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
aren't
those
questions...
whether
each
series
is
a...
each
one
episode
in
a
series
is
a
separate
work,
it
sounds
to
me
like
that's
a
legal
question.
is
it--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
say
the
same
thing
about
the
two
stations,
whether
they
were--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--separate
entities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
if
this
judge
ruled
on
those
two
questions
as
a
matter
of
law
that
he
was
wrong.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
happened
on
the
infringement
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
summary
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
don't
think
that
this
question,
how
many,
could
be
summary
judgment,
too,
but
you
say
it
wasn't
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
fullness
of
time
didn't
equity
clean
up?
i
mean,
the
cleanup
doctrine
that
if
there
were
damages...
the
main
thing
was
injunctive
relief,
but
you
could
incidentally
collect
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
there
was...
you
didn't
have
to
bring
a
separate
action
at
law
under
the
cleanup
doctrine.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
judge
could
no
longer
set
the
order
of
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
about
the
argument
that
actual
damages
may
be
hard
to
prove
and
so
because
the
legal
remedy
is
inadequate,
actual
damages,
so
you
have
this
alternate
of
the
statutory
damages,
so
doesn't
equity
come
in
when
the
legal
remedy
is
inadequate.
isn't
that
the
basic
reason
for
equitable--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we've
already
agreed
that,
as
equity
emerged,
you
could
combine
the
two.
you
could
clean
up,
you
could
get
damages
if
you...
the
main
thing
that
you
want
is...
in
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--until
beacon
and
dairy
queen--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
was
routine.
you
could
go
into
equity
and
say,
by
the
way,
equity
cleans
up,
clears
up,
so
incidentally,
award
me
damages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
but
i
thought
that
the
cleanup
doctrine
originated
in
england
and
we...
our
law
developed
in
the
same
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
tashman,
if
i
follow
your
argument
correctly,
then
if
a
copyright
holder
comes
in
at
the
outset
and
says,
i
want
the
court
to
find
that
there
has
been
an
infringement
and
i
want
statutory
damages,
i
don't
want
any
other
kind
of
damages,
could
such
a
plaintiff
then
avoid
having
a
jury
trial
on
the
question
of
infringement?
on
your
theory,
i
take
it
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
seems
to
be
a
debate
about
what...
the
number
of
infringements,
whether
that
was,
in
fact,
a
summary
judgment--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
whether
each
episode
counts
as
a
work.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts
said
that
is
a
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
don't
want
to
distract
you
with
a
question
that
would
be
peculiar
just
to
this
case,
but
i
think
you
have
made
an
important
clarification
that
in
your
argument
statutory
damages
are
just
like
injunctive
relief,
so
if
you
come
into
the
court
and
say,
all
i
want
is
an
injunction,
then
the
infringement
will
be
determined
by
the
court
as
well.
similarly
here,
if
the
copyright
holder
says,
i
want
to
have
those
statutory
damages
and
so,
please,
no
jury
to
say
whether
the
defendant
infringed
or
not.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
also
on...
if
all
you
have
in
your
corner
is
tull,
then
you
lose
on
infringement,
you
lose
on
willful,
or
innocent.
that
would
also
be
for
the
jury
under--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
i
mean
as
a
question
of
whether
you
would
be
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
if
there
is
a
fact
to
be
tried.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
tull
is
all
you
have,
then
if
there
is
a
fact
to
be
tried,
the
only
thing
you
would
get
from
a
judge
is
the
amount
of
damages,
not
the
willfulness
determination,
not
the
number
of
infringing
acts,
and
not
the
basic
infringement
question.
what
more
could
you
get
from
tull
except
the
very
last
piece
of
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
the
court
find
willfulness
here
as
kind
of
a
part
of
his
explanation
of
why
he
picked
20
rather
than
500
dollars?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
were
doing
what
you
just
described
today
it
would
still
be...
if
all
you
want
is
the
injunction,
no
money
relief
at
all,
you
want
to
stop
the
other
picture
from
being
shown,
you
don't
have...
the
other
side
and
you
don't
have
a
jury
trial
right
if
all
you're
seeking
is
an
injunction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
wouldn't
get
the
damages,
because
your
claim
would
be
precluded.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i
thought--
--no--
--justice
stevens--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--was
asking
the
question,
suppose
neither
side
wants
the
jury,
you
have
a
judge
trial,
plaintiff
gets
an
amount
calculated
by
the
judge--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
says,
judge,
i
don't
like
that
calculation.
do
it
under
statutory
damages.
