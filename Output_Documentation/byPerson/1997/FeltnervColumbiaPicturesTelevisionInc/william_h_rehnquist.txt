mr.
roberts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
concept
of
statutory
damages
has
changed
some,
has
it
not,
from
1856
to
1909?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
guidelines,
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
at
any
rate
the
test
is
what
was
the
practice
at
the
time
of
the
adoption
of
our
constitution,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
what
became
the
practice
later.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well.
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
tashman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
punitive
damages?
a
jury
has
extraordinary
discretion
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
you
would
lose
under--
--but
if
it
were
legal,
then
you'd
have
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
infringement,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tashman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
roberts,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
returned
general
verdicts
where
there
was
a
statutory
specified
amount
for
each
sheet?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
it
wasn't
a
great
mystery
what
the
calculation
ought
to
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
