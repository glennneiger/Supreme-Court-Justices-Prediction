--and
at
that
point
do
you
tell
the
jury...
and
this
is
a
problem
that
i
have
that
runs
through
the
whole
case
as
to
what
the
judge
tells
the
jury.
would
it
suffice
if
the
jury
is
told,
render
such
damages
as
you
consider
to
be
just?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
looked
in
devitt
and
blackmere
to
see
if
there
were
any
instructions
on
statutory
damages.
there
are
not.
the
common
law
measure
is
there.
i'm
just
not
sure
what
the
judge
tells
the
jury.
i'm
not
sure
also
which
way
that
cuts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
those
are
all
set
forth
in
nimmer
and
in
the
brief,
amicus
brief
filed
by
the
composer's
association
and
again,
i'm
not
sure
which
way
that
works.
it...
on
the
one
hand
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
an
area
where
we
should
develop
uniformity
and
consistency
and
judges
would
be
helpful.
i
suppose
your
answer
to
that
is
that
a
set
of
jury
instructions
developed
over
the
years
could
do
the
same
thing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
distinction
is
that
in
tull
the
government
received
the
money
and
that
makes
it
a
governmental
type
of
penalty
and
here
the
private
individual--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
owner
of
the
copyright
receives
the
money
and
therefore
it's
not
a
penalty.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
they
didn't
fix
them
in
this
clean
water
act,
either,
under
tull.
i'm
asking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
know
we
have
a
problem
with
tull
for
your
case
and
you
want
to
limit
it
and
you
indicated
it's
a
penalty,
but
can't
you
look
at
the
statutory
damages
also
as
a
penalty,
and
so
i
ask,
does
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--identity
of
the
recipient
determine...
is
that
what
your
distinction's
based
on?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
understand
it,
after
the
statute
of
anne,
the...
if
a
copyright
owner
thought
the
damages
were
a
little
too
small,
so
he
preferred
often
to
go
into
equity
to
get
an
injunction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
when
he
did
that,
could
he
also
get
damages?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
not
get
damages
on
the
equity
side.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you...
is
there
a
citation
for
that
in
your...
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that
was
overruled,
basically,
by
the
statute...
well,
all
right,
thank
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
that
inconsistent
with
the
argument
you
made
earlier
that
congress
sets
the
amounts?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
you...
we
were
talking
earlier
about
how
to
distinguish
or
confine
tull
and
you
said,
well,
the
congress
sets
the
amounts.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
congress
there
set
a
vast
range,
and
it's...
which
is
very
much
like
the
statute
we're
involved
with
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
don't
want
to
interrupt
justice
breyer's
colloquy
with
you,
but
you're
talking
about
two
things.
you're
talking
about
the
identity
of
the
recipient
and
the...
whether
or
not
the
amount
is
fixed
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
latter
doesn't
help
you
here,
because
justice
breyer
i
think
implied
that
the
range
of
penalties
that
congress
sets
under
the
clean
water
act
in
tull
look
very
much
like
the
range
that
it
is
setting
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
although
i
suppose
a
judge
could
protect
himself
and
say,
if
you're
going
to
submit
the
matter
to
me,
are
you
asking
for
actual
damages
or
statutory
damages
and
you
can
say
we...
make
a
prayer
in
the
alternative.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
suppose
a
judge
could
protect
himself
by
demanding
to
know
from
the
client
in
advance
what
he
wants.
