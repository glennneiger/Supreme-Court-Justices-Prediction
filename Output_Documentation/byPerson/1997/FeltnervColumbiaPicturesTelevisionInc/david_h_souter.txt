justice
david
h.
souter
i
take
it
in
the
'56
act
there
was
no
opportunity
to
elect
a
different
damage
scheme
after
verdict
but
before
a
judgment
as
there
is
in
the
current
act.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
if
we
followed
your
reasoning
in
this
case,
as
i
think
your
opponents
have
pointed
out,
we
would
have
to
accept
as
a
consequence
that
a
jury
could
render
its
verdict
on
actual
damages,
be
discharged,
go
home,
and
at
that
point
the
election
could
be
made
to
go
for
statutory
damages,
and
i
don't
know
what
happens
then.
i
guess
the
jury
would
have
to
be
called
back
on
your
theory.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
could
happen,
couldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
did
the
tull
footnote
7
in
effect
say
that's
not
a
consideration
that
should
influence--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let
me
ask
even...
even
in
that
case,
i'm...
i
want
to
ask
a
question
that
goes
to
the
point
of
whether
tull
helps
you
even
on
damages
alone.
one
reason
mr.
roberts
suggested
that
tull
might
not
help
you
on
that
is
that
in
tull
there
was
no...
there
was
no
18th
century
analogue
and
here
he
says
there
is
and,
going
to
that
point,
my
question
is
this.
granted
that
in
the
early
actions
which
were,
i
guess,
brought
in
this
country
either
for
debt
or
in
an
action
on
the
case
for
damages
which
were,
as
you
point
out,
just
mathematically
calculated...
you
find
the
number
of
sheets,
you
multiply
it
times
a
penny
or
whatnot,
and
that's
your
verdict...
nonetheless,
despite
the
rather
mechanistic
way
that
damages
would
be
calculated
in
those
cases,
is
there
authority
that
indicates
that
in
those
early
cases
the
juries
were
returning
verdicts
simply
of
so
many
sheets
plus
infringement,
as
distinct
from
a
verdict
for
money
damages?
in
other
words,
were
the
juries
coming
back
with
general
verdicts,
or
were
they
simply
coming
back
with
the
basis
for
calculating
a
verdict
which
the
judge
then
did?
do
we
know?
in
other
words,
i
want
to
know
what
the
18th
century
analogue
is
here
in
practice.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
case,
which
is
not.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
let's
assume
that.
let's
assume
that
the
analogue
is
not
point
for
point.
how
do
you
answer
this
objection
one
of
the
questions
that
we
have
to
ask,
if
we
get
to
the
point
in
the
argument,
is
whether
the
jury...
according
the
jury
trial
under
the
present
circumstances
is
necessary
to
preserve
the
substance
of
whatever
the
18th
century
right
was.
if
we
start
with
the
conclusion
that
the
18th
century
juries
were
at
least
awarding
something
in
the
nature
of
actual
damages,
as
distinct
from
statutory
damages
today,
you
nonetheless
i
think
have
to
face
this,
that
if,
today,
a
plaintiff
asks
for
actual
damages,
the
plaintiff
would,
on
the
reasoning
of
the
18th
century
analogue,
get
the
jury
trial
right
and
the
defendant
would
get
the
benefit
of
the
jury
trial
right.
whereas
if
today's
plaintiff
says,
i
want
to
go
for
big
money,
i
want
to
go
for
the
kind
of
statutory
damages
which
in
this
case
could
have
resulted,
i
think...
what
was
it,
44
million
dollars,
the
upper
limit
+/?
a
great
deal
of
money,
anyway,
the
jury
right
disappears
and,
given
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
it
disappears
even
on
the
question
of
liability.
don't
you
face
the
problem
of
how
we
preserve
the
substance
of
the
18th
century
right
if
we
accept
your
argument
and,
in
particular,
if
we
accept
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
that
it
at
least
goes
to
liability
and
the...
on
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg,
the
right
to
a
jury
determination
on
liability
is
likewise
gone
if
the
election
is
made
to
accept
the
statutory
damages.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
would
be,
but
at
least
the
accounting
is...
is
at
least
for
money
that
should
not
have
been
in
the
pocket
in
the
first
place.
we're
talking
about
a
statutory
damage
remedy
here
with
an
outer
limit
in
a
willfulness
case
that
exceeds
anything
that
was
known
to
18th
century
equity,
i
would
suppose.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we...
is
that
the...
i
mean,
i
think
that's
a
very
good
argument.
it
raises
a
question
in
my
mind
as
to
whether
we
should
accept
that
analogy,
because
isn't
the
analogy
that
we
look
at
in
asking
about
the
preservation
of
the
substance
of
the
jury
trial
right
the
analogy
between
the
action
at
law
then,
or
an
action
at
law
then
and
an
action
at
law
now?
in
other
words,
should
i
accept
your
analogy
to
what
equity
could
do?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
if
there's
no
jury
trial
at
all,
if
there's
no
jury
right
at
all,
he's
going
to.
