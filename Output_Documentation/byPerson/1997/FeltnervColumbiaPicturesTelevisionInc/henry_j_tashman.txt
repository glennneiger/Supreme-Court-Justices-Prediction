mr.
henry
j.
tashman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
congress
enacted
statutory
damages
in
1909
as
an
alternative
to
actual
damages
to
provide
some
recompense
to
copyright
holders.
congress
did
this
because
it
recognized
that
actual,
legal
damages
were
frequently
difficult,
if
not
impossible
to
prove
and
therefore
did
not
provide
an
adequate
remedy.
statutory
damages
were
later
amended
and
expanded
in
1975
and
in
1988.
the
formulation
of
an
alternate
form
of
relief
where
legal
damages
are
inadequate
is
quintessentially
an
equitable
remedy.
moreover,
statutory
damages
require
and
involve
the
exercise
of
nearly
unbridled
discretion
by
the
court
and
an
appeal
to
the
court's
sense
of
justice
based
upon
the
particular
facts
in
an
individual
case
to
fashion
a
remedy
that
is
both
just
and
consistent
with
the
goals
of
the
copyright
act.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
no,
it
didn't.
i
think
the
tull
footnote
7
said
that
the
government's
argument
regarding
discretion
was
in
a
sense
trumped
by
the
fact
that
what
we
were
dealing
with
in
tull
were
punitive
damages,
or
a
punitive
statute
and
that
was
the
more
important
consideration
in
tull
and
the
court
correctly
stated
in
tull
that
punitive
damages
and
penalties
were
the
exclusive
province
of
the
courts
of
law
and
not
the
courts
of
equity.
however,
statutory
damages,
and
by
that
i
mean
the
damages
in
the
1909
and
1976
act,
are
not
punitive
damages
and
this
court
has
so
ruled
in
the
l.
a.
westermann
case.
the
primary
purpose
of
statutory
damages
is
to
find
some
method
of
recompense
to
the
copyright
holder,
given
the
inadequacy
of
the
legal
remedy
of
actual
damages.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
absolutely.
i
would
characterize
statutory
damages
as
an
equitable
action
and
an
equitable
proceeding,
just
like
an
action
for
an
injunction
and,
as
in
an
action
in
an
injunction,
all
the
issues,
including
the
issue
of
infringement,
would
be
for
the
court
and
in
a
similar
fashion,
if
only
statutory
damages
were
sought,
which
is
quite
possible
under
the
current
act,
in
the
1976
act,
then
all
of
the
issues,
including
infringement,
would
go
to
the
court.
now,
in
this
case
statutory
damages
were
not
elected
until
after
the
court
granted
summary
judgment
both
on
copyright
liability
and
also
the
number
of
infringements
which
were
involved.
the
court
held--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--oh,
there's
no
question
about
it.
the
only
question
that
i
think
is
subject
to
some
debate,
and
even
that
is
really
not
subject
to
serious
debate,
is
not
the
number
of
broadcasts,
because
that
was
either
found
by
the
court
or
stipulated
to,
but
the
number
of...
or
the
number
of
series
that
were
broad...
the
number
of
episodes
which
were
broadcast
because,
again,
that
was
stipulated.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
correct.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
it
is,
except
in
this
case
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
the
facts,
and
we
don't
dispute
the
facts.
there
was
no
dispute
at
trial
that
the
series
are
sold
in
a
single
contract.
there
was
no
dispute
at
the
trial
that
the
stations
are
free
to
broadcast
any
number
of
the...
of
these
episodes,
but
in
this
case
it
was
stipulated
to
that
each
and
every
one
of
the
episodes
was
broadcast
between
two
and
three
times
on
a
separate
date.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
yes,
i
think
that
would
flow
once
the
court,
or
if
the
court
characterized
the
statutory
damages
as
an
equitable
remedy
and
an
equitable--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--well,
there's
a
huge
amount
of
discretion
involved.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
and
that--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--well,
i
have
to
agree
with...
i
have
to
disagree
with
your
honor
on
two
counts.
first,
as
to
the
practice
at
common
law,
under
the
colonial
statutes
and
under
the
1790
act
as
well,
the...
well,
let
me
focus
on
the
1790
act
first.
the
jury
played
no
role
whatsoever
in
determining
the
amount
of
damages.
the
only
thing
the
jury
determined
was
whether
or
not
there
was
an
infringement
and
the
number
of
copies
in
the
possession
of
the
infringer
and,
once
those
two
facts
had
been
determined,
damages
were
calculated
arithmetically
by
multiplying
the
number
of
works
in
possession
by
the
10
cents
a
page,
or
whatever.
so
if
we
look
at
the
state
of
the
world
just
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
seventh
amendment,
the
jury
really
had
no
role
in
calculating
the
amount
of
damages.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
i'm
afraid
i
have
to
disagree
with
your
honor
again.
willfulness
is
a
concept
that
is
completely
alien
to
copyright
infringement
at
common
law
and,
indeed,
it's
completely
alien
to
copyright
infringement
until
1978.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
that
is
certainly
true.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
unlike
the
assessment
of
statutory
damages
within
a
range,
which
involves
a
huge
amount
of
discretion
and
this
discretion
is
really
entirely
different
from
the
discretion
that
a
jury
uses
in
trying
to
ascertain
the
appropriate
amount
of
actual
damages.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
it
certainly
has
more
discretion
than
it
does
in
determining
actual
damages,
but
for
example,
the
jury
cannot,
and
it
would
be
error
for
the
jury
to
take
into
account
the
conduct
of
the
attorneys
and
the
conduct
of
the
litigants
in
bringing
the
litigation
and
how
they
conducted
the
litigation
and
yet
these
are
factors
that
courts
have
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
amount
of
statutory
damages.
also,
i
think
juries--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--well,
i--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--i
believe
there
are
cases
which
have
held
that
it
would
be
reversible
error
for
the
jury
to
consider
the
conduct
of
counsel
at
trial
and
that
that
conduct
has
been
considered--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--if
statutory
damages...
absolutely.
the
courts--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--the
courts--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--no,
no,
in
statutory
damages
courts
have
used
the
cooperation
or
lack
of
cooperation
and
the
manner
in
which
counsel
have
conducted
themselves
at
trial
as
a
factor
in
determining
the
appropriate
amount
of
statutory
damages.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
i'm
very
happy
about
tull
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
disown
that
case.
tull
i
think
is
controlling.
in
the
event
that
the
court
finds
that
statutory
damages
are
a
legal
remedy,
our
initial
threshold
argument
is
that
statutory
damages
are
not
legal
but
are
equitable.
tull
is
not
consistent
with
that.
tull
found
that
the
civil
penalties
in
that
case
were
legal.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
right.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
we
are
arguing
that
this
is
equitable,
but
in
the
event
that
the
court
rejects
that
and
finds
that
it
is
legal,
we
are
clearly
arguing
that,
based
upon
tull
and
based
upon
the
second
prong
of
the
test
in
the
court's
recent
decision
in
markman,
that
it
would
be
entirely
appropriate
for
the
court
to
assess
the
amount
of
statutory
damages.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
correct.
so...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
certainly
we
don't
lose
on
infringement
because
in
this
particular
case
infringement--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--i
know--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--i
would
think
that
tull
would
give
us
more
than
the
last
piece,
and
that
would
be
any
issues
that
relate
solely
to
the
question
of
liability,
such
as
willfulness,
would
be
the
province
of
the
court,
and
i
think
that's
especially
significant
in
this
case.
there
is
no
requirement
under
the
copyright
act...
and
the
petitioners
make
this
argument
and
i
think
it's
clearly
incorrect,
that
there
is
no
mandatory
requirement
for
a
finding
of
willfulness
or
a
finding
of
innocence.
the
statute
gives
the
court
the
absolute
discretion
to
award
damages
between
500
dollars
and
20,000
dollars
without
any
finding
whatsoever
as
to
willfulness
or
innocence
and
in
this
case
the
court
found
that
20,000
dollars
was
the
appropriate
award,
and
that
is
an
award
which
does
not
require
any
finding
of
willfulness
or
innocence.
only
if
the
court
wants
to
go
above
the
20,000
dollars
is
there
a
requirement
that
the
court
find
willfulness.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
we
certainly
know
that
the
court
did
find
willfulness.
as
to
why
the
court
decided
to
award
20,000
dollars,
which
would
be
the
maximum
amount
without
a
finding
of
willfulness,
we
really
don't
know.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
i
think
we
could
avoid
that
problem
by...
in
a
case
where
the
plaintiff
requests
damages
no
greater
than
20,000
dollars.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
i...
that's
not
a
question
that
i
have
an
answer
to,
although
i
would
argue
that,
regardless
of
whether
or
not
the
juries
specified
an
amount
in
the
award
or
whether
they
just
specified
the
number
of
copies
in
the
possession
of
the
defendant,
that
this
statute
and
the
colonial
statute
are
entirely
inadequate
analogues
to
statutory
damages,
because
the
key
and
the
essence
of
statutory
damages
is
finding
an
alternate
way
to
recompense
the
plaintiff
outside
of
the
standard
rules
of
proof
and
outside
of
the
standard
measure
of
damages
and
outside
of
the
standard
rules
of
evidence.
and
what
we
have
in
the
18th
century
are
classic,
rigid,
legal
causes
of
action
either
in
debt,
which
is
a
sum
certain,
which
is
the
antithesis
of
statutory
damages--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--or
case,
but
again,
while
there's
more
flexibility
in
case,
what
we're
talking
about
is
actual
damages.
what
we're
talking...
there's
no
question
that
case
is
the
analogue
of
actual
damages
under
504(b)
and
there's
no
question
that,
under
504(b)
for
actual
damages,
there's
a
constitutional
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
don't
think
the
substance
of
the
18th
century
right
goes
to
the
amount
or
the
size
of
the
award.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
and
that
is
no
different
from
the
fact
today,
or
during
the
18th
century,
that
if
a
copyright
holder
brought
an
action
for
an
injunction
plus
an
equitable
accounting,
that
all
issues
in
that
case,
including
the
question
of
infringement,
would
be
for
the
court.
now,
the
size
and
the
impact--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
true
if
you
factor
in
inflation,
but
regardless
of
that,
if
you're
talking
about
an
injunction
to
enjoin
another
copyrighted
work...
for
example,
today
one
motion
picture
believes
another
motion
picture
is
infringing
and
if
you
want
to
talk
about
leverage,
the
leverage
and
the
risk
is
not
so
much
the
damages
as
enjoining
the
infringing
work,
which
may
have
cost
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars,
before
that
work
is
distributed
based
upon
copyright
infringement.
so
it's
quite
possible
that
when
you're
dealing
with
injunctions
the
potential
for
injury
to
the
defendant
is
just
as
great,
if
not
greater,
than
when
you're
dealing
with
actual
damages
or
statutory
damages.
indeed,
i
think--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--well,
certainly
equity
did
not
do
that
in
the
18th
century,
but
if
there
were
statutory
damages
it
would
be
an
equitable...
it
would
be
an
equitable...
you
would
get
them
in
equity,
because
they
involve
extraordinary
discretion--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--i
think
that's
not
subject
to
dispute
and
that
could
result
in
damages
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars,
injury
of
hundreds
of
millions
of
dollars--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--no,
when
i
say...
i'm
sorry,
when
i
say
damages,
the
consequence
of
an
injunction,
given
those
facts,
would
result
in
a
huge
amount
of
injury
to
the
party
being
enjoined.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
i
know
the
amici
have
raised
those
issues
and
i
can
only
speak
to
my
experience
in
this
case
and
in
this
case
we
do
not
believe
that
a
jury
would
be
incapable
of
awarding
statutory
damages.
i
suspect
a
jury
would
have
awarded
more
statutory
damages,
because
once
they
found
willfulness,
they
would
have
felt
compelled
to
go
into
the
willfulness
range,
which
is
something
the
district
court
did
not
do.
i
can
see...
so
we
don't
think
that
this
gets
into
the
third
prong
articulated
in
ross,
at
least
not
given
the
facts
here.
i
can
see
hypothetically
two
situations
where
it
would.
first,
where
statutory
damages
were
elected
after
a
jury
came
down
with
a
verdict
for
actual
damages
and
then
you'd
have
to
send
back
that
jury
and
the
jury,
having
deliberated
and
figured
out
that
x
dollars
was
the
appropriate
award
of
damages,
kind
of
send
them
back
and
tell
them,
no,
no,
no,
unring
the
bell,
come
up
with
another
award,
and
i
think
that's
conceptually
a
difficult
thing
to
ask
a
jury
to
do,
kind
of
to
unring
the
bell,
especially
when
you
don't
give
them
any
guidelines
to
tell
the
jury...
other
than
the
possibility
of
willfulness
or
innocence,
which
is
not
a
mandatory
factor
but
a
discretionary
factor.
so
i
would
think
under
those
facts
it
would
be
something
that
would
be--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--i'm
sorry,
can
you
repeat
the
question?
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
the
judge
hasn't
taken
a
first
look,
because
the
judge
has
not,
while
the
case
was
going
to
the
jury,
spent
days
trying
to
figure
out
the
appropriate
amount
of
actual
damages
and
lost
profits,
so
the
judge
is
really
coming
to
that
issue
completely
afresh,
while
the
jury
is
already
committed
to
this
concept
that
x
dollars
were
lost
profits
and
x
dollars
were
actual
damages.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
the
judge
doesn't
determine
actual
damages.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
if
there's
no
jury
right,
then
the
judge
won't
determine
actual
damages
because
the
only
question
is
statutory
damages,
so
in
that
case--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
ah.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
thank
you.
is
that
your
hypothetical?
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
thank
you
for
the
clarification.
i
would
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
a
judge,
but
i
think
a
judge
would
be
in
a
better
position
to
go
back
and
to
recalculate
or
rethink
than
a
jury
would
be,
although--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--correct.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
i
think
that's
quite
true.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
no.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
no.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
i
hope
you
wouldn't
rule
based
upon
that.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
i
think
my
client
would
not
feel
better
off
if
he
lost.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
well,
i
think
we're
dealing
with
intangible
rights.
we're
dealing
with
rights
that
are
inherently
difficult
to
value.
we're
dealing
with
rights
which
are
not
consumed.
we're
dealing
with
cases
where
you
have
large
companies
suing
local
establishments,
where--
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
--where
it's...
you
know,
it's
very
difficult
to
try
to
figure
out
how
a
huge
music
company
has
been
injured
by
joe's
bar
and
grill
performing.
mr.
henry
j.
tashman
thank
you
very
much.
