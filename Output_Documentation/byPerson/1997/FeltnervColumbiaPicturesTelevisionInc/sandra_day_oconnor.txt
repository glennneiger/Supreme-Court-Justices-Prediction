none
of
which
have
been
effective.
it's
been
a
serious
problem.
but
this
copyright
law
is
so
odd,
because
under
your
version,
then,
a
jury
would
go
out
and
could
determine
actual
damages
and
come
back
with
a
verdict
and
a
figure
and
then
the
plaintiff
can
say,
well,
i've
looked
at
that,
i
think
i'd
do
better
under
statutory
damages
and
can
reject
that
and
ask
for
statutory
damages.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
the
tull
case
from
this
court
we
upheld
a
scheme
under
similar
seventh
amendment
type
concerns
and
said
the
judge
could
nonetheless
determine
statutory
damages.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
maybe
that
would
be
true
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
assume
the
willfulness
aspect
could
certainly
go
to
a
jury
if
that
were
the
court's
decision,
but
what
would
your
position
be
on
the
balance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
there
still
is
a
discretionary
element
there,
a
range
of
sentences.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
didn't
the--
--that's
difficult
to
do,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
in
an
injunction
the
question
for
the
court
is
whether
certain
conduct
should
be
prohibited
or
not
and
here,
in
the
statutory
damages,
there
is
a
range
of
options
for
the
imposition
of
the
damages
and
there's
a
certain
amount
of
discretion
involved
in
fixing
the
amount
within
the
possible
range,
is
there
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
that
is
a
typical
question
that
a
jury
would
address
and
certainly,
if
you
look
to
the
common
law
antecedents,
that's
the
kind
of
thing
that
in
the
copyright
area
would
have
been
determined
by
a
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
surely
would
have
had
a
role
in
determining
what
later
emerged
to
be
an
element
of
willfulness
and
the
extent
of
the
violation
and
how
many
pages,
or
how
many
events
occurred.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
it's
a
concept
that
is
very
familiar
at
common
law
in
all
kinds
of
criminal
and
tort
law
situations.
that's
a
typical
determination
by
a
jury,
is
something
intentionally
done,
or
willfully
done.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
lends
itself
to
jury
determination
very
readily.
