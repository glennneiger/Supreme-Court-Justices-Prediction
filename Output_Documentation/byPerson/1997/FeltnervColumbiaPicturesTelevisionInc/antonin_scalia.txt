justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying
that
in
principle
they
could
never
be
ruled
on
as
a
matter
of
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
facts
could
be
so
clear
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
find
the
factual
element
except
one
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
assert
that's
not
the
case
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that
that
would
be
impossible
under
punitive
damages,
if
the
jury
thought
that
the
defendant
in
the
case
knew
that
it
was
guilty
and
had
conducted
a
rear
guard
action
of
obstructionist
litigation
and
so
forth?
i'm
not
sure
a
jury--
justice
antonin
scalia
--couldn't
consider
that
for
punitive
damages.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sure
just
an
isolated,
you
know,
piece
of
rudeness
or
something
like
that,
i'm
sure
that
would
be
the
case.
you
think
that
could
be
taken
into
account
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
really?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
jury
thinks
counsel
were
rude
to
the
judge--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
really
want
to
slice
this
statute
very,
very
fine,
so
that
not
only
does
the
amount
of
damages
somehow
get
lopped
off
from
the
rest
of
it,
but
even
within
the
damage
provision,
up
to
20,000
dollars
can
be
decided
by
the
judge
alone
and
when
you
get
above
that,
if
there's
willfulness,
it...
the
jury
has
to
be
called
in.
how
does
that
work?
what...
i
mean,
how
does
the
judge
know
there's
no
willfulness,
so
that
he
should
only
give
up
to
20,000
dollars?
i
assume
he
has
to
send
it
to
the
jury
first
for
the
jury
to
find
whether
there's
willfulness
and,
if
the
jury
finds
no,
then
he
can
do
between
5
and
20,
but
that
didn't
happen
here,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
require
the
determination
to
be
made
in
advance
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it...
so
the
answer's
no.
