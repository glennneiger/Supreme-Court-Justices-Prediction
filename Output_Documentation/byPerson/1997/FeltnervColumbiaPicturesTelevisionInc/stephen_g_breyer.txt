justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
evidence
who
set
the...
in...
under
the
statute
of
anne
in
the
18th
century
it
was
a
penny
a
sheet
or
something,
i
think,
in
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there
was
an
argument
about
how
many
sheets
there
were,
did
the
jury
decide
it
or
the
judge,
do
we
know?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--perhaps
you've
said
this,
but
it
would
be
helpful
if
you
could
just
summarize
in
a
sentence,
possibly.
if
you
take
tull,
you
know,
and
look
at
part
3...
you
know
what
i'm
thinking
of.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
and
then
suppose
someone
were
to
say,
well,
that
seems
to
describe
this
case,
you
would
say,
no
it
doesn't,
and
the
main
distinction
that
you
would
make
between
part
3
of
tull
and
this
case
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
two
if
you'd
like,
or
three,
but
i
mean,
i'm
just
trying
to
get
the
heart
of
what
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
the
history
of
it
that
in
england
the
amount
of
damages
wouldn't
have
been
an
issue
in
terms
of
amount
in
respect
to
the...
because
the
statute
of
anne
says
a
penny
a
page,
but
in
the
united
states
your
point
is
that
some
states
did
make
it
a
jury
issue?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
about
if...
suppose
a
person
brought
in
the
18th
century
an
action
for
an
injunction
and
coupled
it
with
a
request
for
damages?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is...
i
just
wonder,
can
i
go
back
for
a
second
to
your
answer
to
justice
ginsburg.
could
you
explain
to
me
very
briefly,
as...
perhaps
i
haven't
a
clear
view
of
tull,
but
tull
was
a
case
that
i
thought
gave
you
support
and,
as
i
understood
the
case,
it
would
have
said
that
the
action
for
damages,
a
penalty
in
that
case,
is,
in
fact,
legal
and
therefore
the
plaintiff
or
a
defendant,
there
would
be
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
but
then
it
talked
about
the
assessment
of
the
amount
of
the
penalty
and,
as
far
as
the
assessment
of
the
amount
of
the
penalty
was
concerned
there
was
no
seventh
amendment
right.
now,
if
that's...
if
i'm
reading
it
correctly,
then
in
this
case
it
would
suggest
that
even
if...
i
take
it
you'd
have
to
say
and
even
if.
even
if
the
claim
is
legal
and
therefore
there
is
a
right
to
a
jury
trial
to
determine
whether
or
not
statutory
damages
is
due,
there
is
under
tull
nonetheless
no
jury
trial
right
as
to
the
amount
of
the
damages.
now,
is
that
a
correct
reading
of
tull?
is
tull
applicable
in
that
way?
are
you
going
to
disown
tull,
or
what
is
it
you
want
to
do
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
now,
i
want
to
know
what
happens
if
i
think,
hypothetically,
that
this
is
a
legal
remedy,
statutory
damages.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
that
point,
is
that
the
end
of
the
matter,
or
are
you
saying
that
indeed,
even
if
that's
so,
given
part
3
of
tull,
the
judge
may
or
congress
may
give
the
judge
the
power
to
assess
the
amount
of
the
penalty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
practical
question
related
to
this
that
i
have
that
you
may
not
have
a
judgment
on,
but
as...
in
your
experience,
copyright
holders
who
by
and
large
are
plaintiffs
in
these
suits,
if
i
compare
them
to
other
plaintiffs,
say
in
tort
suits,
we
don't...
i
haven't
normally
heard
complaints
from
plaintiffs
in
tort
suits
about
the
jury.
to
the
contrary.
they
feel
that
punitive
damages,
et
cetera,
normally...
i'd
say
not
everybody,
but
the
jury's
more
than
adequate,
or
adequate
in
awarding...
taking
care
of
the
interests
of
the
tort
plaintiffs
through
punitive
damages,
et
cetera.
why
is
it,
in
your
experience,
that
in
this
case
the
copyright
holders
who
tend
to
be
plaintiffs
in
these
cases
fear...
at
least,
i
read
that
into
what
they're
saying,
that
the
jury
won't
be
able
properly
to
compensate
them
or
to
work
with
a
statutory
punitivetype
situation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we'd
have
to
overrule
tull,
in
your
view.
