well,
mr.
jordan,
by
way
of
background,
the
iolta
funds
account
also
include
deposits
from
corporations,
do
they
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
to
the
corporate
moneys
that
are
deposited
as
opposed
to
the
share
that's
the
result
of
deposits
by
individuals,
is
there
a
correspondingly
larger
amount
of
interest
earned?
i
mean,
is
there
interest
being
earned
in
the
accounts
for
the
corporate
funds
that
exceed
the
cost
of
maintenance
of
the
funds?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
what
percentage
of
the
deposits
are
from
corporate
as
opposed
to
individuals?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
was
curious
because
the
amounts
of
individuals
that...
of
interest
earned
that
wouldn't
exceed
the
cost
of
establishment
and
maintenance
of
the
fund
nevertheless
seem
to
be
generating
substantial
amounts
of
money
for
these
programs,
and
so
it
seemed
to
me
very
likely
there
were
corporate
deposits
that
were
generating
substantially
more
interest,
and
that's
why
so
much
was
being
earned.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
corporations
making
these
deposits,
or
anyone,
for
that
matter,
given
an
option
about
whether
to
have
their
moneys
go
into
an
iolta
account
or
not,
or
is
it
required
that
they
go
into
an
iolta
account?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
--but
i
thought
for
the
corporate
client
they
were
prohibited
from
receiving
the
interest
from
the
now
account.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
now,
could
the
corporation
doing
business
say,
okay,
i'm
going
to
get
legal
services,
but
you
put
my
deposit
with
an
account
that's
not
a
now
account
and
i'll
take
the
interest,
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
or
is
not,
or
you
don't
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
except
for
the
corporate
deposits.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
let's
not
forget
that,
because
they
can
be
very
substantial,
but
there's
some
provision
in
the
law
for
now
accounts
that
says
you
can't
pay
anything
to
a
corporation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
jordan,
let
me
ask
you
something
before
your
time
is
up.
the
court
below
found
there's
a
property
interest,
a
cognizable
property
interest
here.
it
didn't
go
on
and
determine
whether
there
had
been
a
taking,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
it's
possible
that
there
might
be
a
property
interest,
but
nonetheless
it
might
turn
out
at
the
end
of
the
day
there's
no
taking.
no
damages,
no
loss,
no
taking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
this
be
a
different
case,
do
you
think,
if
each
person
giving
a
lawyer
money
that
might
go
into
an
iolta
account
were
given
a
choice
and
asked
to
decide
whether
to
agree
with
the
iolta
scheme
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--mr.
kneedler,
though,
in
the
case
of
a
corporation
it's
the
federal
government
that's
saying
a
corporation
can't
have
any
interest
earned
on
its
money.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
texas
state
law
about
interest
following
principal?
is
it
the
law
in
the
state
of
texas
that
net
interest
follows
principal,
only
the
net?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
sellers
case
sort
of
sounds
like
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
if
texas
law
is
to
the
effect
that
only
net
interest
goes
with
the
property,
and
if
we
take
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
there
isn't
any
net
interest,
then
where
does
that
leave
us?
