justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
does
it
say...
it
says,
considered
without
regard
to
funds
of
other
clients.
that's
what's
causing
the
confusion,
i
think,
because
if
you
think
of
three
clients,
a,
b,
and
c,
and
they
each
give
you
100,000
dollars
to
hold
for
a
day,
all
right,
and
you'd
think,
well,
there's
no
way
at
all
that
i
can
open
up--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--three
accounts,
but
if
i
have
a
regular
account
here
and
i
put
all
300,000
dollars
in
this
account
of
the
firm,
maybe
then
it
would
earn
interest,
and
then
the
words
here,
it
says,
such
funds
could
not
reasonably
expected
to
earn
interest,
but
it
says,
considered
without
regard
to
other
funds.
that's
what's
mixing
me
up.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
consider
it
without
regard
to
other
funds
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
means,
in
the
example
that's
being
given...
i'm
sorry
to
give
this,
but
its...
everyone
has,
and
i
think
it's
not
totally
clear
yet,
that
what
we
have
is
a
circumstance
where
there
are
three
clients.
they
each
give
you
some
money,
if
you
have
to
open
up
three
accounts
it's
just
not
going
to
be
worthwhile
because
the
administrative
expenses
are
too
great.
but
the
banker
comes
to
you
and
says,
give
me
all
three
together.
there
is
no
iolta
fund
in
the
state
i'm
talking
about.
he
gives
me
all
three
together,
and
i
will
generate
interest
for
you
that
exceeds
administrative
costs.
now,
in
that
circumstance,
do
you
put
that
money
in
that
fund,
which
is
private,
or
do
you
give
it
to
iolta?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you...
my
answer
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
do
consider--
--then
what's...
what--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
a
lot.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
did
you
ever
overpay
your
income
tax?
you
know,
you
have
to
pay
so
much
a
quarter?
you
ever
pay
more
than,
the
first
quarter
than
you
actually
owed
proportionately?
did
they
give
you
a
refund
check
back
at
the
end
of
the
year?
i
haven't
gotten
mine.
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
can
we
reach
this
question?
this
is
just...
there
is
some
property.
i
have
1,000
dollars.
you're
my
lawyer.
i
give
it
to
you.
the
state
of
texas
is
taking
my
1,000
dollars
and
using
it
to
make
money
for
other
people.
i
can
imagine
somebody
arguing
that
they
don't
have
the
power
to
use
my
money
to
make
money
for
somebody
else,
but
somehow
that
isn't
being
argued.
that
is
to
say,
we're
in
this
question
of
a
property
interest,
and...
so
how
in
your
opinion
would
we
reach
that
question,
whether
texas
does
or
does
not
have
the
power
to
take
my
money
and
use
it
to
generate
some
money
for
another
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if
that's
so,
why...
this
is
exactly
the
problem
i'm
having.
it's
very
easy
for
me
to
see
arguments
both
ways
if
we
look
at
the
property
as
the
deposit,
because
then
the
issue
becomes,
can
the
government
take
this
piece
of
property
and
use
it
to
earn
money
for
another
person?
now,
we
know
the
government
can
take
real
property
and
can
insist
you
put
up
an
antipollution
thing.
and
they
do
it
just
to
earn
money
for
a
downstream
business,
say
a
tourist
business.
they
perhaps
could
force
my
water
over
a
dam,
which
would
generate
electricity
that
would
go
to
another
person,
and
maybe
even
they
take
my
advance
payment
on
my
taxes
and
they
use
that
payment
to
make
money
for
the
government,
and
they
never
pay
me
anything.
in
any
of
those
cases
it
seems
to
me
the
issue
is
the
correct
use,
constitutional
or
not,
of
the
property
i
own,
not
the
electricity,
not
the
money
that's
earned
in
the
tourist
attraction,
and
not
the
money
that
the
government
happens
to
use
my
money
to
get
for
itself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
on
any
of
those
analogies,
the
answer
is
there
is
no
property
interest
in
what's
used,
what's
gained,
but
the
question
is
whether
we
can
use
the
basic
fund
for
that
purpose.
now,
i
put
that
quite
squarely
because
i
want
to
hear
your
response
to
the
point,
why
is
there
a
property
interest
in
that
electricity
that
my
water
is
used
to
make,
or
the
interest
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
take
my
water
and
they
say,
run
it
over
the
tva
dam,
and
as
a
result
it
makes
electricity
which
otherwise
couldn't
be
produced.
the
government
takes
that
electricity,
sells
it,
keeps
the
money.
it's
just
like
the
interest
here.
they
take
your
money
and
they
use
it
to
make
some
other
thing
that's
worth
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there's
a
lot
of
law
that
concerns
contracts
and
trusts,
and
misuse
of
trusts,
and
i
take
it
it's
common
law
in
most
states
that
if
a
trustee
misuses
your
money
and
makes
money
out
of
it
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
that
to
you,
and
that
seems
to
help
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
what's
worrying
me
here
is
that
we're
talking
about,
not
your
loss,
but
the
misperforming
trustee's
gain,
let's
say,
assuming
everything
in
your
favor,
the
misperforming
trustee's
gain
over
and
above
your
loss,
and
i'm...
have
you
found
anything...
i'm
nervous
about,
or
would
worry
about
the
consequences
of
constitutionalizing
that
amount,
of
suddenly
we
invade
trust
law
and
contract
law
by
saying
there
is
a
property
interest
in...
let's
take
a
misperforming
trustee,
who
makes
some
money
out
of
your
money
in
an
amount
greater
than
you
could
have
ever
made.
and
now,
what
happens,
once
we
say
there's
a
constitutional
interest
in
that?
is
there
suddenly
going
to
be
an
implication
for
bankruptcy
proceedings,
or
for
state
laws
that
decide
for
some
reason
not
to
give
that
extra
amount
back
to
the
person
who
put
the
money
into
the
trust?
what
happens
in
a...
i'm...
i
can't
quite
foresee,
the
terrible
word,
erisa
cases.
[laughter]
i
can't
quite
foresee
that,
and
i'd
like
to
get
your
reaction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no.
no.
that's
a
misuse
of
the
yard.
that's
right.
that's
what
i
think
is
the
question
in
the
case.
can
they
or
can
they
not
use
the
1,000
dollars
in
this
way?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
whether
the
vegetables
if
they
do
use
it,
who
they
happen
to
belong
to,
i
mean,
i
don't
know.
i
guess
that's
a
question
of
state
restitution
law.
if
it
was
a
misused
garden,
i
don't
know
that
the
constitution
says
who
the
vegetables
have
to
belong
to,
but
the
constitution
might
say
whether
you
can
use
the
garden
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
because
you
can
tell
the
government
to
get
out
of
your
yard
you're
in
the
same
position,
it
seems
to
me,
that
you're
in
here,
when
you
can
say
to
the
lawyer,
give
me
the
1,000
dollars.
the
government
isn't
stopping
you
from
doing
that.
