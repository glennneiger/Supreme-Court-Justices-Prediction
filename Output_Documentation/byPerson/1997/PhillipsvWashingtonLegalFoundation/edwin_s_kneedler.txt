mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
there's
not,
but
there's
also
no
requirement,
state-imposed
requirement
that
a
client
turn
over
money
to
the
lawyer.
that
is
a
matter
of
private
contractual--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
the
basic
point
here
is
that
the...
whether
the
federal
constitution
requires
the
state
of
texas
to
conclude
that
the
interest
generated
by
an
iolta
account,
which
state
law
declares
to
be
the
property
of
the
texas
equal
access
to
justice
foundation,
instead
to
be
the
property
of
the
individual
client,
and
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
question
of
whether
a
property
right
arises
takes
place
in
a...
in
two
heavily
regulated
areas.
one
is
the
practice
of
law,
and
the
other
is
the
banking
industry,
which
this
court
has
recognized
is
perhaps
the
most...
the
classic
example
of
a
heavily
federally
regulated
area.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but
whether...
the
question
of
whether
a
client
has
a
legitimate
or
a
reasonable
investment-back
expectation
in
earning
net
interest
necessarily
arises
against
the
background
of
the
banking--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--banking
regulations
and
economic
reality.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
but
there
are
several
important
distinctions
between
this
case
and
webb's,
if
i
may
highlight
them,
because
i
do
think
they're...
they
illustrate
what's
so
different
about
this
case.
first
of
all,
in
webb's
the
premise
of
the
court's
opinion
was
that
the
interest
earned
was
not
tied
to
reimbursing
the
state
for
its
costs.
in
other
words,
the
premise
was
that
there
was
net
interest
earned.
there
was
a
separate
exaction
by
the
state
calculated
on
a
percentage
of
the
amount
deposited
to
reimburse
the
state
for
its
costs,
so
that
was
a
case
where
there
was
net
interest.
here,
the
fundamental
precept
of
iolta
is
that
the
individual
client's
accounts
would
not
be
able
to
earn
net
interest.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
difficulty
with
that
option,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
one
of
the
important
considerations
in
the
irs'
approval
of
this
and
the
revenue
ruling
81-209
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
was
that
the
client
did
not
have
control,
because
if
the
client
has
control
as
to...
over
whether
the
lawyer
will
deposit
the
money
in
the
iolta
account,
then
the
income
generated
by
that
account,
which
goes
to
a
charitable
contribution,
might
be
an
assignment
of
income
by
the
individual
taxpayer,
individual
client,
because
the
client
would
be
exercising
control
over
the
disposition,
so--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
now,
i--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
there
are
two
separate...
the
client
doesn't
have
to
give
money
to
the
lawyer.
that's
a
matter
of
private
contractual--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it's
the
fact
of
whether
the...
and
after
all,
it's...
again,
looking
at
the
overall--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but...
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
that's
not
a--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
not
a
state-imposed
requirement.
that's
a
matter
of
private
contractual
relationship,
and
it's...
i
think
it
would
be
the
rare
client
who
would
have
the
sort
of
substantial
objection
that
the
client
has
in
this
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
for
the
lawyer's
own
income,
but
it
is
protection
for
the
lawyer's
income,
and
the
retainer
is
regarded
as
the
client's
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
once
the
matter
is
over
with--
[laughter]
it's
security
for
the
lawyer,
but
once
the
matter
is
over
with
the
money
is
returned
to
the
client--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--if
the
client
is
separately
billed.
if
the
lawyer
draws
down
on
the
retainer,
then
obviously
when
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--when
the
money
is
paid
out
that
belongs
to
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
i
think
that's
right,
but
it's
important...
this
is
not
real
property,
as
in
lucas.
this
is
personal
property,
and
as
the
court
said
in
the
lucas
case,
that
questions
of
property
arise
looking
at
background
principles
of
state
and
federal
law,
and
here
it
couldn't
be
clearer,
looking
at
the
background
of
state
law,
that
the
client
has
no
established
entitlement
to
the
interest
generated
by
the
iolta
account.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
let
me
answer
it
this
way.
typically,
when
a
person
deposits
money
in
a
bank...
i
realize
this...
the
client
is
not
directly
depositing
it
in
the
bank,
the
lawyer
is.
but
when
a
person
deposits
money
in
a
bank,
what
the
depositor
gets
in
return
is,
it's
really
a
debt
owed
by
the
bank.
when
you
write
a
check
the
bank
has
promised
to
pay
you
to
allow
you
to
withdraw
funds.
but
once
the
funds
are
deposited
in
the
bank,
the
bank
uses
them.
the
bank
earns
money
on
them.
so
at
a
time
when
there
were
no...
there
was
no
interest
on
demand
deposits,
and
that's
still
true
for
corporations,
it's
not
as
if
no
one
is
benefiting
from
that
money.
the
bank--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no.
i...
that's
because
i
think
real
property...
real
property
is
different.
there's
no
question
that
you--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
question
here
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
question
is
just
the
interest,
and
it...
the
history
of
our
country
shows
that
there
is
no
constitutional
entitlement
to
earn
interest.
the
background
of
our
banking
laws--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
is
a
sufficient
reason,
but
i
did
want
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question,
because
in
the
banking
situation
someone
else
is
clearly
earning
money
on
the
deposit.
if
what
texas
did
was,
instead
of
setting
up
this
program
in
the
way
that
it
did,
required
every
bank
to
pay
2
percent,
or
the
equivalent
demand
deposit
amount
to
the
state
for
all...
measured
by
the
amount
of
iolta
accounts
in
the
bank
without
setting
up
a
separate
account,
but
simply
all
clients'
funds
in
the
bank
of
a
certain
minimal
amount,
the
bank
has
to
pay
an
exaction
measured
by
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--there
would
be
no
question
that
the
clients'
property--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right,
and
petitioners
concede
at
page
35
of
their
brief
that
there
is
no
constitutional
entitlement
that
interest
is...
interest
is
only
allowed
when
provided
for
by
statute
or
agreement
of
the
parties.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the...
that's
a
very
different
situation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i'm...
i
think...
i'm
not
certain
that
it
would
be.
it
depends...
it
depends--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
webb's...
it
would
depend
upon
whether
there
was
any
reasonable
relation
between
the
exaction
and
the
interest,
but
here
the
background
rule
is
that
the
money
could
not
earn
any
interest
for
the
client
to
begin
with,
and
therefore
putting
it
into
the
account,
from
one
noninterest-bearing
account
to
another
from
the
perspective
of
the
client
does
not
affect
the
client's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--thank
you.
