what
about
federally
imposed
requirements?
can
the
federal
and
the
state
governments
collude
to
establish
a
system
in
which
it
is
impossible
for
a
private
individual
to
earn
any
interest
by
reason
of
the
way
the
banking
laws
are
written,
and
then
the
state
come
in
and
say,
well,
since
you
can't
make
any
interest
privately,
we're
going
to
take
your...
we're
going
to
take
the
interest
that's
earned
and
use
it
in
this
governmental
scheme.
doesn't
something
strike
you
wrong
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
this
whole
thing
works
only
because...
because
corporate
money
can't
receive
interest--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
immediate
payment
accounts,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
rule
is
adopted,
but
if
you
allow
those
corporate
funds
to
be
used
for
something
else,
some
good
thing
that
the
state
wants
to
do,
then
it's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
client
doesn't
have
the
option
if
the
lawyer
is
not
willing
to
proceed
without
some
funds.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
this
is
a
rather
unrealistic
option,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you've
got
to
find
a
lawyer
who's
willing
to
go
ahead
without
any
deposit.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
doing
it
with
my
money.
suppose,
mr.
kneedler,
i
have
a
piece
of
land
that
has
no
economic
value.
it
simply
is
not
rentable,
it's
not
usable
for
anything.
does
that
mean
the
government
can
come
in
and
take
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
real
property
is
different?
i
just...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
government
has
the
right
to
take
something
away
from
me
just
because
it
says,
hey,
it's
no
use
to
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
what's
going
on
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
samp,
can
i...
coming
back
to
justice
kennedy's
escheat
example,
i
was
thinking
that
that
differs
from
this
in
that
the
owner
of
a
bank
account
that
would
be
escheated
has
voluntarily
let
it
go.
he's
abandoned
it,
in
effect.
but
then,
maybe
that's
not
true,
because
the
contention
has
been
made
here
that
these
people
have
an
option,
too,
that
they
don't
have
to
let
the
lawyer
hold
onto
their
money.
what
is
your
response
to
that
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
is--
--mr.
samp,
can
i
ask
you,
is
this
case
necessarily
over,
have
you
gotten
over
the
hill
if
we
agree
with
you
on
this
aspect
of
the
case?
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
thing
before
us
is
whether
your
client
has
a
property
interest
in
the
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
conceivable
that
he
has
a
property
interest
but
that
there
hasn't
been
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
since
he
could
not
harvest
that
property
interest,
so
to
speak,
it
was
worthless
to
him,
the
holding
below
on
remand
could
be
there's
been
no
taking
of
that
property
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
you
acknowledge
that
they
are
two
separate
questions,
and
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
there
is
a
property
interest.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
the
taking
clause,
just
normal
property
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
worry
was
just
the
opposite
of
justice
breyer's.
i
worry
that
if
we
hold
that
there
is
no
property
interest
here,
that
where
this
kind
of
a
plan
did
not
exist,
the
lawyer
himself
would
be
able
to
merge
all
clients'
funds
that
could
not
individually
make
a
profit
and
keep
whatever
interest
comes.
i'm
sure
that
that's
not
what
the
common
law
would
normally
provide,
that
that
interest
would
be
considered
the
property
of
the
individual
clients
who
ponied
up
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
there's
no
property
interest,
there
would
be
no
basis
for
such
a
rule,
i
assume.
