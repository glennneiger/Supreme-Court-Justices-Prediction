are
you
familiar
with
any
case
in
which
there
is
a
regulation
but
the
state
is
enriched
as
a
result?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
we
have
a
client
who
does
have
a
huge
trust
deposit,
and
the
state
of
texas
says,
you
know,
this
iolta's
working
pretty
well.
we're
going
to
take
the
interest
from
everybody.
we're
going
to
take
the
interest
on
the
million
dollar
trust
account,
and
we're
going
to
use
it
for
state
programs.
that's
a
taking,
isn't
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
a
taking?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about--
--why
is
isn't
it
a
taking?
--webb's
fabulous
pharmacies?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
can
we
argue
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
no
net
interest
can
be
attributed
to
this
client?
can
we
argue
the
case
on
that
assumption?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
that
assumption,
why
should
you
still
prevail?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
this
case
is
something
like
an
escheat.
all
states
escheat
bank
accounts
after
different
periods
of
time,
some
7
years.
can
a
property
owner
come
and
say,
well,
you
know,
you
really
should
give
me
10
years.
in
10
years
i
would
have
got
this.
this
is
really
mine?
the
state
uses
it
for
escheats
and
uses
it
for...
it
takes
the
money
and
uses
it
for
any
purpose
it
wants.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
isn't
this
something
like
abandoned
property,
because
under
the
assumption...
and
i
know
you
have
an
alternate
base,
but
under
the
assumption
that
we...
on
which
we're
considering
the
case,
you
simply
cannot
trace
and
pay
the
interest,
so
it
seems
to
me
very
much
like
an
escheat.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
that
we
made
it
very
clear
that
interest
is
earned,
but
that
it's
not
net
interest
in
the
sense
that
the
administrative
cost
of
tracing
it
and
paying
it
to
the
client
will
exceed
the
interest
itself.
i
thought
that's
the
basis
we're
arguing
the
case
on.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's--
--well,
assume
that's
still
the
premise
of
this
case.
yes.
assume
that's
still
the
premise
of
this
case.
as
justice
ginsburg
outlined
it,
why
does
the
client
have
a
reasonable
investment-backed
expectation
of
interest
when
we
stipulate
that
he
could
never
get
that
interest?
