justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
net
benefit
that
you're
emphasizing.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
i
understand
you
correctly,
what
you're
saying
is
that
if,
after
subtracting
either
the
law
firm's
or
the
bank's
accounting
cost,
so
much
as
one
penny
could
be
earned
for
the
client,
it
does
not
go
into
iolta
and,
in
fact,
it
will
be
invested
in
a
way
that
will
get
the
penny
to
the
client.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
these
pooled
funds,
even
though
the
pooled
funds
earn
interest,
the
cost
of
accounting
for
that
interest
separately
to
the
client
would
be
greater
than
the
interest
that
would
be
attributable
to
the
client.
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
you
said
a
moment
ago,
and
i
thought
correctly,
that
the
client
does,
in
fact,
have
that
option.
in
answering
justice
scalia's
question
you
said
the
client
doesn't
have
to
leave
any
money
in
a
lawyer's
trust
account.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
as
opposed
to
assigning
it
to
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
under
the
irs
there's
no
problem
in
the
client
having
a
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
to
take
the
money
back
as
opposed
to
leaving
it
in
in
a
way
that
will
earn
interest
for
this
charitable
organization.
that
doesn't
offend
the
irs
reg.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
mr.
kneedler,
i
thought
the
answer
was
simpler
than
that.
i
thought
the
answer
was
the
one
you
mentioned
earlier.
the
client
is
not
being
forced
to
devote
his
property
to
someone
else's
benefit.
the
client
can
say,
give
me
the
retainer
back.
i
won't
give
you
the
money.
pay
me
the
closing
costs
in
cash
immediately.
he
may
have
trouble
finding
a
lawyer
who
wants
to
do
that,
but
that's
not
a
requirement
of
the
state.
isn't
that
the
reason--
justice
david
h.
souter
--that
we
don't
have
in
this
case
the
question,
how
can
you
make
me,
in
effect,
devote
my
property
to
someone
else's
benefit?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
don't
have
a
factual
record
developed
to
support
that,
do
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
i
don't
know
why
we
would
decide
the
case
on
that
assumption.
i
mean,
you
may
have
a
different...
you
may
have
a
very
different
case
to
bring,
and
anything
based
upon
the
premise
of
this
case
might
be
quite
irrelevant
to
the
one
that
you
are
now
telling
us
exists,
but
i
don't
see
how
we
can
decide
your
other
case
on
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--factual
premise
that
we
don't
have
before
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
might
be
a
correct
reason
for
digging
this
case,
too.
well,
so
you're
saying...
you're
arguing
for
affirmance
on
an
alternate
ground
as
well
as
on
the
ground
that
the
court
of
appeals
took?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
the...
when
iolta
talks
about
the
offset
it's
talking
about
offsets
beyond
that.
it's
talking
about
offsets
necessary,
not
only
to
account
for
the
funds,
but
to
account
for
them
separately
to
each
source,
to
file
the
appropriate
tax
information
for
each
source,
to
pay
the
interest
out
to
each
source,
and
so
on,
and
those,
in
fact,
are
separate
costs
which
are
not
incurred
in
a
pooled
fund.
so
sure,
you're
right,
no
matter
how
you
hold
it
there's
going
to
be
some
accounting
cost,
but
the
premise
of
iolta
is,
there
are
going
to
be
more
accounting
and
reporting
costs
if
you're
going
to
account
for
them
separately
to
the
client
and,
in
fact,
when
you
do
so
that's
going
to
wipe
out
any
benefit
to
the
client.
there
will
be
a
net
of
zero
or
less.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
that
the
premise?
justice
david
h.
souter
does
the
state
require
him
to
pay
the
1,000
dollars
to
the
lawyer?
that's
a
matter
of
his
contract
between
him
and
the
lawyer.
i
don't
see
how
that's
attributable
to
the
state.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
state
doesn't
say
that
this
1,000
dollars
has
got
to
be
paid
to
the
lawyer
and
put
in...
to
be
put
in
a
trust
account.
the
state
doesn't
tell
him
he's
got
to
pay
the
lawyer
1,000
dollars.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there
was
a
difference
in
webb's,
and
the
difference
was
in
effect
that
there
was
a
background
of
practice
in
dealing
with
money,
and
given
that
background
of
practice
with
dealing
with
money,
it
was
the
standard,
the
norm
that
the
interest
went
to
the
person
whose
principal
was
earning
it.
there
isn't
that
kind
of
a
background
of
practice
here.
maybe
we
should
say
that
there
should
be
a
legal
requirement
that
the
two
be
treated
the
same,
but
we
are
certainly
going
to
go
beyond
webb's
if
we
hold
your
way.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there
was
a
general
background
principle
that
sums
of
money
capable
of
earning
interest
at
commercial
rates
in
substantial
amounts,
as
a
general
rule,
went
to
the...
as
a
general
rule
under
those
circumstances
the
interest
went
to
the
person
who
owned
the
principal.
that
was
the
background.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
there
is
a--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
the
question,
i
think,
is
whether
we
should
say
that
the,
i
guess
consistently
different
background
treatment
in
commercial
and
legal
practice
here
is
not
entitled
to
some
constitutional
significance,
and
we
can't
make
that
determination
simply
by
saying
this
is
like
webb's,
because
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
it
is
like
webb's.
do
you
agree
at
least
with
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
they
are
necessarily
two
separate
questions
for
us
here?
it's
one
thing,
i
suppose,
to
ask
abstractly
whether
there
is
a
property
right
in
the
interest,
but
it
seems
to
me
equally
legitimate
to
ask
the
question,
should
we
recognize
a
property
right
in
the
interest
for
fifth
amendment
purposes
if,
in
fact,
the
result
on
the
premise
of
the
case
would
be
that
there
was
no
just
compensation
due
at
the
end
of
the
road
because
the
client,
in...
because...
yes,
the
client
in
fact
had
lost
nothing
that
the
client
would
otherwise
have
had?
in
other
words,
wouldn't
it
be
legitimate
for
us
to
consider
what
will
happen
at
stage...
or
what
ought
to
happen
at
stage
2
in
deciding
whether
in
the
first
instance
to
recognize
a
property
right
at
stage
1?
justice
david
h.
souter
it
expressly
reserved
it,
as
i
recall.
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
wouldn't
your
case
be
basically
the
same
even
if
there
were
no
iolta
and
the
banks
were
simply
getting
the
benefit
of
the
deposit?
it's
true,
the
banks
would
not
be
going
through
the
formality
of
paying
itself
interest,
but
you
would
have,
it
seems
to
me,
exactly
the
same
property
claim
that
you've
got
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
interest
follows
principal
only
if
there
is
a
background
practice
of
paying
interest.
