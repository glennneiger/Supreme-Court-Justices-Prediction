mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
texas
iolta
program
is
an
extension
of
the
ethical
rules
that
have
always
been
applicable
to
lawyers
in
connection
with
their
maintenance
of
client
funds.
lawyers
have
always
been
required
to
manage
client
funds
as
fiduciaries.
the
rules
required
this
before
iolta
programs
were
adopted,
they
require
it
today
under
iolta,
and
they
would
require
it
tomorrow
if
iolta
programs
went
away.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
that's
correct,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice.
clients
received
no
interest
income
on
their
nominal
and
short-term
deposits
before
iolta.
during
iolta,
they
don't
receive
any
interest
income
on
their
nominal
and
short-term
deposits,
and
if--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
justice
o'connor,
we
are
not
able
to
track
what
percentage
of
the
iolta
interest
income
that
gets
to
the
foundation
comes
from
corporate
or
partnership
deposits.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
i
only
have
my
opinion,
and
that
would
be,
justice
o'connor,
that
probably
about
60
percent
or
so
do
come
from
corporate
or
partnership--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--one
of
the
reasons,
your
honor,
that
iolta
is
able
to
earn
interest
for
the
foundation
when
it
cannot
for
individual
clients
whose
money
is
deposited,
whose
short-term
and
nominal
funds
are
deposited
in
iolta
accounts,
is
that
it
takes
advantage
of
the
changes
in
the
banking
law
that
occurred
in
1980
where
corporate
and
partnership
accounts
can
be
pooled
with
individual
funds
in
an
iolta
account,
and
then,
based
on
the
tax
ruling,
there's
no
taxable
transaction,
the
efficiency
of
the
economy
of
scale
where
one
pooled
account
and
the
recipient
can
be
attributed
to
one
foundation,
all
of
this
generates--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--justice
o'connor,
the
iolta
program
is
mandatory
for
the
lawyer.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
it's
part
of
the
disciplinary
rules.
if--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--but
if
there's
any
way
a
client's
deposit
can
earn
net
interest
for
that
client,
whether
it's
a
corporate
client,
whether
it's
an
individual
client,
the
lawyer's
ethical
responsibility
is
to
do
that.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
your
honor,
they
would
not
be
able
to
have
those
funds
placed
in
a
now
account,
a
demand
account.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
under
our
rules,
your
honor,
that
may
be
permissible.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
if
the--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--well,
i
know
that
it
is,
and
the
rule
that
the
fund
must
be
returned
to
the
client
on
demand
is
satisfied
as
long
as
the
account
is
placed
in
a
bank.
it
could
be
a
time...
but
as
long
as
the
client
understands
that,
our
rules
permit
it.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
mr.
chief
justice,
before
iolta,
of
course,
the
deposits
from
clients
were
put
into
a
noninterest-bearing
demand
account,
for
the
most
part.
with
the
advent
of
iolta,
if
the
amount
of
the
client
deposit
was
small
enough,
or
was
going
to
be
held
for
a
short
enough
period
of
time,
they
went
into
the
iolta
account.
iolta
doesn't
apply
to
any
amounts
of
money
that
are
going
to
be
able
to
earn
net
interest
for
the
client,
so--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--iolta
enables,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
client
funds
of
many
clients
to
be
pooled.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
because
the
client,
mr.
chief
justice,
had
no
reasonable
expectation
to
receive
interest
income,
net
interest
income
on
small
or
short-term
deposits
before
iolta,
during
iolta,
and
if
iolta
were
to
go
away,
that
benefit
would
be
retained
by
the
banks.
it
would
not
change
one
thing
for
the
client.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--a
lawyer
or
a
law
firm
is
able
now,
mr.
chief
justice,
to
pool
eligible
client
funds,
and
if
there
can
be
any
way
that
that
account
can
yield
a
net
benefit
to
the
client,
that's
what
the
lawyer
is
supposed
to
do.
that's
the
fiduciary
responsibility
of
a
lawyer
to
his
or
her
client.
it's
only
the
funds
that
are
incapable,
whether
using
technology,
subaccounting,
pooling,
or
whatever,
that
cannot
yield
a
net
benefit
to
a
client,
that
go
into
iolta.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
it
does
cover
those.
if
a
separate--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
must
have
misunderstood
your
question,
then,
because
what
i'm
saying
is
that
when
the
lawyer
receives
the
funds
from
the
client,
he
or
she
makes
an
independent
determination
about
whether
they're
able
to
be
placed
in
an
account
that
would
benefit
the
client,
using
any
means
that
are
legal,
subaccounting,
pooling,
whatever.
if
they
determine,
in
good
faith,
that
those
funds
cannot
be
placed
so
as
to
benefit
the
client,
then
they
go
into
the
iolta
account,
and
if
the--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--no,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
lawyer,
in
good
faith,
determines
that
there
is
no
way
that
that
client
fund
can
earn
net
interest,
interest
over
the
cost
of
attributing
it,
then
the
money
goes
into
an
iolta
account.
that
is
required
under
our
rules.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
looked
at
independently--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--these
funds
usually
come
in
at
different
times.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
if
you
could,
justice
stevens,
put
them
with
19
other
eligible
accounts
into
a
pooled
account
in
the
name
of
the
law
firm--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--and
if
that
process
enables
you
to
earn
a
net
interest
benefit
for
the
client,
then
you
are
able
to
do
that.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
because--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--justice
stevens,
it's
only
the
amounts
from
clients
that
are
unable
to
be
placed
in
an
account
that
would
yield
a
net
benefit
to
a
client...
you...
it's
the
net--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--it's
the
net
benefit.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
that's
correct.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
that
is
correct,
justice
souter,
and
one
other
thing
that
i
think
is
important--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--except
for
the
corporate
deposits.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
justice
o'connor,
one
of
the
things
that
makes
iolta
possible,
of
course,
is
the
irs
ruling
that
allows
there
to
be
no
taxable
transaction.
if,
in
justice
souter's
question,
you
were
attributing
and
tracking
the
interest
to
be
paid
to
each
client,
then
the
bank,
whether
it's
a
sub
account
or
whatever,
would
have
to
have
a
taxpayer
id
number,
the
bank
would
have
to
send
a
1099,
the
law
firm
would
either...
then
have
to
figure
out
who
gets
what
amount
of
interest,
and
there's
an
awful
lot
of
additional
administrative
accounting
expense
that
must
be
taken
into
account.
but
the
fact
remains,
if
a
lawyer
can
find
a
legal
way
to
create
a
benefit
for
a
client
using
those
funds,
then
they're
supposed
to
do
it.
but
as
a
practical
matter--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--justice
breyer--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--justice
breyer,
in
a
situation
where
there
are
many
lawyers
in
a
firm,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
posed,
you
have
to
make...
the
lawyer
has
to
make
that
decision
about
whether
the
client
funds
are--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--yes,
you
do.
yes,
you
do.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
if,
justice
breyer,
there's
any
way
that,
using
the
banking
accounts
that
are
available
to
you
as
a
lawyer,
you
can
create
a
net
benefit
to
a
client,
then
you're
supposed
to
do
it.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
your
answer
is
yes.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
you
look
at
it...
you
look
at
it
independently,
and--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--because,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
fact
is
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
amount
of
money
that
comes
from
a
client
and
the
approximate
length,
in
your
good
faith
judgment,
that
it's
going
to
be
held
in
your
account,
without...
you
won't
know,
as
a
lawyer,
what
else
is
in
that
trust
account.
if
you're
in
a
firm,
for
instance,
that
it...
that
has
several
lawyers,
each
of
whom
handle,
during
the
course
of
their
practice,
client
funds,
you
may
not
know,
and
usually
it's
an
accounting
person
that's
going
to
decide
and
give
you
guidance
about
whether
or
not
there's
some
opportunity
there
that
can
benefit
a
client,
so...
but
as
a
lawyer,
you're
the
one
under
the
court's...
the
supreme
court
of
texas
is,
anyways,
supervision,
and
told
to
determine
whether
in
good
faith
you
think
it
can
be
earned
some
benefit
for
a
client,
so
that's
the
reason.
the
practical
approach--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--no.
mr.
chief
justice,
generally
speaking,
if
you
had
100,000
dollars
client
fund
there's
probably
some
way
you're
going
to
be
able
to
place
it
in
a
way
that
benefits
a
client.
you...
these
amounts
are
usually
smaller.
they're
usually
held
for
only
as
long
as
it
takes
a
check
to
clear.
if
you
take
into
account,
let's
say
a
50,000
dollars
settlement
in
a
tort
case,
and
let's
assume
that
in
your
state
the
maximum
rate
in
a
now
account
is
2-1/2
percent.
2-1/2
percent,
50,000
dollars,
earns
about
2.05
dollars
a
day.
if
it's
going
to
be
held
for
the
5
days
that
it
takes
the
check
to
clear,
that's
10
dollars
and,
what,
25
cents.
there's
no
practical
way
that
you
can
create
an
account
and
capture
that
net
interest
benefit
for
the
client.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
yes,
justice
ginsburg.
if
the...
at
the
foundation
they
believe
that
somebody
has
erred,
there's
precedent
for
calling
the
lawyer
and
saying
what
are
the
facts
here,
and
at
least
four
times
there
have
been
reimbursements
made
through
the
bank.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
the
person
at
the
foundation
realizes
that
this
is
an
abnormal
amount
of
interest
that
has
come
from
an
account
that
historically
has
not
generated
that
kind
of
activity.
they
call
the
lawyer,
find
out
what
the
facts
are
with
regard
to
the
account,
if
the
mistake
has
been
made
in
good
faith,
well
then
the
interest
is
returned
to
the
bank,
and
the
transaction
between
the
bank
and
the
lawyer
is
straightened
out.
that's
what
we
do.
in
texas,
justice
ginsburg,
we've
got
about
60,000
lawyers.
30,000
of
those
say
they
have
occasion
during
their
practices
to
handle
client
funds,
and
they
answered
our
compliance
request
affirmatively.
of
those
30,000,
there
are
about
16,000
active
iolta
accounts.
we
get
about
five
and
a
half
million
dollars
a
year,
which
means
that
each
active
iolta
account
of
the
16,000
generates
less
than
1
dollar
a
day.
it's
a
little
bit
of
money
coming
in
from
a
lot
of
accounts
that
makes
this
whole
program
possible.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
yes,
justice
o'connor.
that's...
they
incorrectly,
we
feel,
determined
that
a--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--property
interest
was
there.
we
don't
agree
with
them.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
believe
there's
a
property
interest
that
these
respondents
have
raised.
if
this
court
disagrees
with
us,
we
still
believe
that
it's
a
regulatory
taking
and
there's...
on
something
that's
worth
nothing,
the
just
compensation
is
nothing,
and
therefore
we're
back
to
where
we
were.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
no,
justice
kennedy,
i'm
not.
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
but
i
believe
that
the
principal
tenets
of
the
iolta
programs
in
texas
and
across
the
country
are
entirely
consistent
with
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
the
lucas
case,
where
we're
talking
about
economic
reality,
not
abstract
economic
theory,
where
we're
talking
about
the
historic
understandings
of
our
citizens
regarding
their
rights
and
reasonable
investment-backed
expectations.
that's
what
clients
before
iolta
did
not
have
with
regard
to
any
interest
opportunities--
mr.
darrell
e.
jordan
--no,
your
honor.
thank
you
very
much.
