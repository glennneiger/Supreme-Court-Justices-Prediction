--okay,
but
in--
--mr.
jordan,
there
was
a
reference
in
the
american
bar
association
brief...
it's
page
9,
footnote
10...
that
says
that
there
is
a
mechanism
in
texas
to
reimburse
a
client
if
it
turns
out
that
the
funds
could
have
generated
interest
and
instead--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--how
does
that
mechanism
work,
because
it's
just
a
very
quick
footnote.
it
doesn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
samp--
--and
also,
isn't
it
clear
that
if
you
lose
on
the
question
that
is
presented,
you
can
still
make
that
argument
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
believe
the
complaint
says
a
small
amount
of
his
money
has
been
in
an
iolta
account
since
may
1993.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
know
there's
no
economic
stake
for
the
lawyer
or
for
the
organization.
what
is
the
pocketbook
interest
for
mr.
summer?
what
is
the
small
amount?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
samp,
i'd
like
to
ask
you...
your
time
is
running
out.
i
take
it
that
on
the
theory
you're
presenting,
this
would
go
for
what
the
justice's
brief
brought
up.
that
is,
the
prisoners
who
want
to
buy
things
at
the
commissary
have
to
put
a
deposit,
and
they
don't
get
any
interest
on
it,
but
the
interest
is
used
to
make...
do
things
to
administer
the
prison,
so
i
take
it,
if
you
prevail
here,
the
same
would
follow
for
the
prisoners.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
samp,
i
thought
that
the...
once
i...
tell
me
if
this
is
a
wrong
fix
on
the
case,
that
it
was
a
question
between
who
was
going
to
get
this
money,
the
texas
fund
or
the
bank,
that
in
no
event
was
it
going
to
enrich
the
lawyer
or
the
client,
so
there
were
two
choices.
if
iolta
is
no
good,
the
bank
gets
the
money.
if
iolta's
okay,
the
fund
gets
the
money,
but
not
the
lawyer
and
not
the
client
in
any
event.
i
thought
that
was
the
basic
premise
of
this
whole
thing.
