we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1578,
thomas
r.
phillips,
et
al.
v.
washington
legal
foundation.
mr.
jordan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
they're
required
to
manage
it
as
fiduciaries
for
the
benefit
of
the
clients,
are
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
jordan,
one
of
your
earlier
statements
makes
me
think
that
very
likely
times
have
changed
since
i
practiced
law
long
ago,
but
my...
i'm
familiar
with
a
firm
trust
account,
whereby
a
number
of
clients'
moneys
would
be
placed
in
the
same
account.
i
don't
ever
recall
a
situation
where
you
opened
up
a
separate
account
for
each
client
whose
money
you
had
in
trust.
the
firm
put
all
of
the
money
in
the
trust
account.
so
it
seems
to
me
it's
not
entirely
accurate
to
say
that
these
moneys
could
never
have
earned
interest.
you
treat
it
as
if
every
single
separate
trust
deposit
would
be
a
separate
account.
that
was
never
true
when
i
practiced.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
about
if
the
amounts
were
pooled?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
shouldn't
that
interest
go
to
the
clients?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
that
if
a
firm
pooled
its
trust
accounts
and
put
them
all
in
one
account,
called
a
trust
account,
the
bank
would
not
have
to
pay
interest
on
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
mean
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
iolta
accounts
wouldn't
cover
a
situation
where
the
firm,
say,
has
20
trust
deposits,
and
no
one
of
those
could
earn
interest
worthwhile
separately,
but
20
of
them
pooled
could?
iolta
does
or
does
not
cover
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
just
said
it
didn't.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
take
my
hypothesis.
the
firm
has
20
separate
trust
deposits.
pooling
them
would
result
in
interest
that
was
useful
to
the
various
clients.
is
there...
does
the
lawyer
have
any
option
in
a
situation
like
that,
under
your
rules?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what's
the
meaning
of
considered
without
regard
to
others?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
doesn't
mean,
then,
that
in
justice
breyer's
hypothesis,
you
would
consider
only
whether
one
of
the
100,000
dollars
deposits
could
earn--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jordan.
mr.
kneedler,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
kneedler,
is
there
any
requirement
that
you
overpay
your
installments
of
income
tax?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it's
been...
this
isn't
any
regulation
of
banks.
it's
a
regulation
of
clients.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
you
could
have
said
the
same
thing
in
webb's
fabulous
pharmacies,
that
the
person
had
no
expectation
under
state
law
because
there
was
a
state
rule
that
said
you
didn't
get
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
didn't
control
the
result
in
that
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
this,
as
i
understand
it,
was
a
retainer,
which
ordinarily
wouldn't
go
into
any
lawyer's
trust
account.
you
get
a
retainer
to...
for
your
own
income.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
since
when?
i
mean,
i
never
regard
a
retainer
as
a
client's
property.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
agreements
may
differ.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
it's
a
mistake
to
think
that
you
would
generally
categorize
what
someone
calls
a
retainer
as
something
that
belongs
in
a
trust
account.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
samp,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
that
the
statements
made
here
say
that
it
was
just
ordinarily
funds
kept
for
a
very
short
time
while
a
check
cleared.
his
funds
were
kept
for
18
months?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
made
no
effort
to
decide
the
second
question,
did
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
samp.
the
case
is
submitted.
