paul

i'm
not
sure
you've
answered
the
chief
justice's
question,
if
i
might
interrupt.
i
think
his
hypothesis
is
that
no
one
of
them
could
separately
earn
interest,
but
that
pooled
in
the
lawyer's
office,
they
could
earn
such
interest.
what
is
done
in
that
situation?
in
other
words,
we
would...
i
had
the
same
practice
years
ago.
we
would
have
one
trust
account
in
which
we
would
deposit
money.
it
was
the
property
of
several
different
clients.
we
wouldn't
treat
them
each
separately,
but
you
have
a
separate
trust
account
which
was
a
pooled
account
and
could
earn
interest,
and
what
does
the
lawyer
do
in
that
situation?
under
your
rules,
what
must
he
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
do
you
mean
independently?
but
i'm
saying--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
look
at
it
independently.
i
say,
yes,
but
if
i
put
it
with
19
other
clients'
accounts
it
will
earn
money.
am
i
looking
at
it
independently
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
that
always
going
to
be
the
case
if
you
have
more
than
one
client?
you
have
a
bunch
of
clients
who
deposit
money,
you
put
all
their
money
in
the
trust
account.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
always
earn
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
the
premise
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
decided
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
assume
that,
and
we're
asked
to
pass
on
whether
their
decision
was
correct
on
that
assumption,
and
that's
why
the
question
was
phrased
the
way
it
was.
we've
rephrased
the
question,
as
i
remember
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
still
protected
in
that
regard.
in
this
case,
which
is
not
a
class
action,
there's
a
vague
reference
to
what
is
at
stake
for...
is
it
mr.
summers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any...
please.
no,
go--
--let
me
ask
you
a
question
if
they're
hesitating,
then.
[laughter]
do
you
think
texas
could
pass
a
statute
repealing
the
rule
that
interest
follows
principal
at
least
in
a
limited
category
of
cases,
including
deposits
by
clients
with
their
lawyers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
state...
if
they
did
it
as
a
matter
of
state
statutory
law,
say,
you
say
they...
the
constitution
would
permit
or
prohibit
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
do
it
by
defining
property
in
a
way
that
doesn't
include
this
category
of
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this.
if
it
were
not
for
the
webb's
case...
you
rely
very
heavily
and
very
properly
on
it...
would
you
have
any
authority
for
your
position,
your
response
to
my
question,
except
webb's?
