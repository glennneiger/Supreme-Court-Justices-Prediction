mr.
richard
a.
samp
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondents
wish
at
the
outset
to
take
issue
with
some
of
the
confusing
language
in
the
question
presented
by
the
petitioners.
petitioners
contend
that
it
is
a
fundamental
precept
of
the
iolta
program
that
only
those
funds
which
could
not
on
their
own
generate
what
they
call
net
interest
go
to
an
account
which
generates
iolta.
that
simply
is
not
the
rule
in
the
state
of
texas.
there
are
many--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--the
court
of
appeals
said,
even
if
that
is
the
case,
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that
is
correct,
and
we
believe
that
the
court
should
uphold
the
fifth
circuit's
decision.
we
believe
that
an
alternative
basis
for
upholding
the
decision
is
that
the
fundamental
precept
as
stated
by
the
petitioners
is
simply
wrong.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
we
do
not
have
a
factual
record,
and
that
was
why--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--the--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
grant
of
summary
judgment
to
the
petitioners.
we
believe
that
that
was
the
correct
decision
under
any
of
the
two
theories
that
we
are
here.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
was
not
proper
to
grant
summary
judgment,
and
if
we
are
correct
that
there
was
a
factual
dispute
in
the
district
court
as
to
whether
or
not
this
fundamental
precept
really
exists,
then
that
would
be
a
correct
reason
for
reversing
the
grant
of
summary
judgment.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that
is
correct,
and
certainly
that
would
be
an
option
to
dig
the
case,
if
your
honor
so
chose.
we
do
believe,
however,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
response
to
the
cert
petition,
that
the
issue
on
which
the
fifth
circuit
ruled
was
directly
in
conflict
with
that
of
two
other
circuits,
and
so
long
as
the
court
is...
has
agreed
to
hear
the
case,
we
think
it
ought
to
decide
that
issue.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
the
small
amount
is
1,000
dollars
that
has
been
in
this
account
since
1993.
the
financial
stake
of
his
lawyer
is
that
his
lawyer
holds
the
legal
title
to
these
trust
funds.
the
beneficial
or
equitable
title
is
held
by
mr.
summers,
so
they
both
have
a
financial
interest
in
these
particular
funds.
and
under
this
court's
decision
in
webb's
fabulous
pharmacy,
the
court
said
very
explicitly
the
earnings
of
the
fund
are
incidents
of
ownership
of
the
fund
itself
and
are
property,
just
as
the
fund
itself
is
property.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
if
you
so
choose.
there
is
an
alternate
basis
for
upholding
the--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--because
it
has
been
the
common
law
rule
for
250
years
that
if,
in
fact,
interest
is
generated,
that
interest
belongs
to
the
client.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
justice--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--justice
breyer,
the
court
in
its
webb's
fabulous
pharmacy
case
saw
these
two
issues
that
you're
presenting
as
really
the
flip
side
of
each
other,
that
really
the
reason
that
interest
follows
principal
is
because
in
effect
the
use
of
the
principal
is
what
generates
the
interest,
and
therefore
the
government's
temporary
taking
or
use
of
the
original
principal
is
the
same
thing
as
the
taking
of
the
interest.
now,
in
some
of
the
examples
you
have
given,
there
are
many
things
that
distinguish
them.
for
example,
in
the
case
of
the
government
taking
a
tax,
it
has
always
been
thought
that
a
properly
constituted
tax
that
does
not
violate
either
equal
protection
or
due
process
does
not
constitute
a
taking.
the
same
would
be
true
of
any
sort
of
user
fee.
the...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
case
of
the
water.
generally,
the
water--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--in
all
respect,
the
navigable...
the
water
in
navigable
streams
has
never
been
though
to
be
private
property.
the
riverbeds
can
be
private
property
but
not
the
water,
so
i'm
not
sure
that
any
of
those
analogies
prove
your
point.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
in
the
case
of
abandoned
property,
that
is
correct,
and
the
rules
of
escheat--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--well,
let
me
distinguish
what...
within
the
question
presented
from
what
all
the
facts
of
this
case
are.
the
petitioners
say
that
you
cannot
earn
interest.
yes,
you
can
earn
interest.
interest
is
what
a
willing
borrower
is
willing
to
pay
for
the
use
of
money.
interest
is
generated.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
and
let
me
add,
justice
kennedy,
that
the
underlying
premise
of
iolta
is
that
there
will
be
these
costs,
yet
those
costs
will
exist
in
any
event.
if
i
operate
a
trust
account,
i
am
going
to
have
certain
bank
charges.
i
am
going
to
have
certain
overhead
costs
in
my
office,
including
the
cost
of
entering
the
names
on
a
daily
basis
into
the
account.
i
am
going
to
have
the
cost
of
reconciling
the
account
at
the
end
of
the
month.
those
costs
will
exist
no
matter
whether
i
put
my
funds
into
an
account
that
earns
interest
for
iolta
or
earns
interest
for
my
client.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
justice
souter,
i'd
like
to
call
your
attention
both
to
rule
6--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--no,
that
is
not.
the
premise
is
that
if
the
net
interest
to
the
client
is
less
than
zero,
that
the
money
does
not
go
at
all
to
the
client.
the...
however,
a
net
interest
of
less
than
zero
will
almost
always
be
a,
still
a
net
benefit
for
the
client.
if
you
look
at
iolta
rule
6,
if
you
look
at
page
43
of
our
brief
in
which
we
lay
out
in
footnote
16
all
of
the
overhead
cost
that
the
state
of
texas
tells
lawyers
should
be
taken
into
account
before
the...
it
is
determined
whether
there
can
be
net
interest,
you
will
see
that
only
one
out
of
seven
items
mentioned
is
the
cost
of
producing
a
1099
form.
the
cost
of
computing
interest
separately--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--the--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--the
sellers
case
indicates
that
if
a
fund
of
interest
is
generated,
the
person
responsible
for
generating
the
interest
is
entitled
to
take
a
reasonable
fee
for
their
expenses
before
paying
on
the
interest.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
texas
law
does
not
say
only
net
interest.
texas
law
says
a
reasonable
fee
can
be
deducted.
it
says
nothing
about
other
costs
that
someone
other
than
the
state
might
be
incurring,
so
that,
for
example,
in
this
particular
case
there
will
be
costs
that
the
attorney
incurs
for
overhead,
for
setting
up
of
the
account,
for
all
of
these
other
things,
yet
the
state
of
texas
does
nothing
to
generate
any
of
those
funds.
this
is
not
a
case
where
somehow
the
state
has
pooled
money.
this
is
pooling
by
the
lawyer
that,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
indicated
before,
has
always
been
going
on.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
there
is
nothing
voluntary
about
the
iolta
program.
first
of
all,
it
says
explicitly
in
the
iolta
rules
that
the
attorney
is
not
required
to
tell
the
clients
about
the
existence
of
the
iolta
program.
indeed,
virtually
no
clients
know
that
their
money
is
going
in
here,
so
they
really
don't
have
that
option.
in
the
case
of
mr.
summers,
he
was
never
told
that
his
funds
were
going
into
an
iolta
account.
when
he
finally
did
learn,
his
case
was
already
18
months
down
the
road,
so
that
to
say
that
there
was
any
sort
of
realistic
option
at
that
point
to--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--they
are
still
in
the
fund.
he
was
sued
in
a
civil
action
in
1993...
or,
excuse
me,
1992.
the...
he
was...
this
was
a
retainer
of
a
different
sort
than
the
one
you
were
describing.
this
was
not
an
advance
payment.
rather,
this
was
1,000
dollars
that
was
put
into
a
trust
account.
it
was
to
be
used
to
ensure
payment
of
regular
bills.
so
long
as
regular
bills
were
paid,
and
they
have
been
in
all
the
years
since
then,
then
the
money
remains
in
the
trust
account.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
the
state
has
stated
that
any
money
in
a
trust
account
must
go--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--similarly,
in
the
webb's
fabulous
pharmacy
case,
there
was
no
requirement
that
anybody
make
a
claim
against
the--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--in
all
due
respect,
in
webb's
there
was
no
such
history.
the
history
in
webb
was
that
in
general,
when
money
had
been
put
into
the
court
registry,
it
sat
there
and
no
interest
was
earned.
at
some
point--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--the
background
in
florida
is
precisely
the
same
in
texas,
and
that
is
a
general
rule
that
interest
follows
principal.
i
have
not
seen
anything
in
the--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--background
principle
that
adds
the
caveats
that
you
have
suggested.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
webb's
did
not
directly
address
the
issue
here.
the
general
background
principles
in
webb's
apply
equally
here,
and
i
think
perhaps
an
effective
way
of
looking
at
this
is
to
look
at
it
really
perhaps
in
the
way
that
justice
breyer
was
suggesting
before,
which
is
that
we
have
the
right
to
exclude
others
from
the
use
of
our
property.
presumably--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--precisely,
and
in
fact
that
is
the
unanimous
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
right
now,
is
that
prison
accounts,
when
they
are
set
up
and
they
actually
earn
interest,
the
prison
is
entitled
to
take
a
reasonable
administrative
fee
off
of
the
top,
but
any
interest
that
remains
is
the
property
of
the
clients,
and
they...
generally
courts
of
appeals
have
said
that
prisons
may
not
take
that
money
and
use
them
as
they
see
fit
for
the
general
benefit
of
the
prison.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
well,
that's
what
they
have
done
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
they
have
announced
a
rule
repealing
it,
and
the
question
is--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--they
have
done
that,
and
it
prohibits
it,
because
this
court
said
in
webb's--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--yes,
and
this
court
in
webb's
said
that
when
you
simply
announce
by
ipse
dixit
that
some
piece
of
property
that
used
to
be
protected
by
state
law
no
longer
is,
that
that
is
precisely
what
the
takings
clause
was
intended
to
prevent.
now,
the
state
is
permitted
to
redefine
property,
but
it
may
not
do
so
in
a
way
that
defines
one
category
of
property
totally
different
from
similarly
situated
property
and,
for
example,
in
our
brief
we
point
out
that
the
state
of
texas
itself
right
now
is
litigating
in
the
ninth
circuit
the
right
to
have
its
trust
funds,
any
interest
earned
on
those
trust
funds,
have
the
interest
go
to
the
state
of
texas
even
though
in
that
particular
case
texas
had
no
right
in
the
first
instance
to
insist
that
interest
be
generated.
so
that
if
texas
is
going
to
be
taking...
making
that
argument,
right
now
in
court
in
that
case,
it
should
not
be
allowed
to
change
property
law
for
similarly
situated
property--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--yes.
in
the
lucas
case,
this
court
generally
talked
about
the
ability
of
the
state
to
change
property
law
and
nuisance
law,
and
what
the
court
said
was
that
if
you
are
going
to
declare
something
a
nuisance,
that
really
has
to
be
consistent
with
background
principles
of
property
and
nuisance
law.
you
can't
just
simply,
by
ipse
dixit,
declare
that
something
is
a
nuisance
and
therefore
say
that
no
compensation
is
due
when
you
pass
a
regulation
stopping
a
particular
activity.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
while
we
would
argue
against
that
result,
that
is
a
possible
result
after
a
favorable
decision
to
us
today.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
i
think
it
would
be
a
preferable
course
for
the
court
to
have
a
full
record
as
to
whether
or
not
there
was
a
loss
to
the
client
prior
to
making
that
determination.
the
initial
decision
the
court
of...
the
district
court
will
have
to
face
is
whether
or
not
the
per
se
taking
rules
apply
and
then,
if
they
do
not,
then
the
question
is,
each
of
the
various
factors
that
the
court
has
enunciated
for
whether
a
taking
exists,
and
those
sorts
of
questions
perhaps
could
best
be
decided
on
a
fuller
record.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that
is
correct,
yes.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that's
correct,
and
they
also,
while
they
reinstated
our
first
amendment
claim,
they
really
had...
had
virtually
no
discussion
of
the
first
amendment
issue,
so
that
regardless
of
how
the
court
rules
today
on
the
fifth
amendment
issue,
we
would
hope
that
that
issue
would
be...
would
still
be
open
on
remand.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
i
am
not
sure
that
a
decision
in
our
favor
in
this
case
would
constitutionalize
the
entire
law
of
trusts.
a
trustee,
for
example,
could
be
found
to
have
failed
to
properly
invest
the
money,
but
that
would
not
be
a
subject
for
the
takings
clause.
however,
it
has
long
been
the
case
that
if
a
trustee
earns
interest,
that
even
though
he
had
no
obligation
to
do
so
in
the
first
place,
it
has
been
considered
that
the
takings
clause
requires
that
interest
to
be
paid
over,
and--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--yes.
in
the--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--i--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--i
agree
with
you
completely,
and
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--perhaps
that
was
a
premise
back
in
1976,
at
a
time
when
interest
could
not
effectively
be
earned
on
accounts.
however,
there
is
a
difference
between
a
bank
having
free
use
of
money
and
a
bank
paying
interest
and
then
deciding
who
gets
that
money.
interest
is
an
actual
payment
of
money
for
the
use
of
funds.
that
has
been
this
court's
definition--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--i
don't
believe
he
has
an
investment-backed
expectation,
and
that
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
there
is
a
taking.
he
has
not
invested
anything
here.
he
does
have
a
very
legitimate
expectation
that
any
interest
that
is
earned
will
be
his,
and
that's
why
this
should
be
considered
to
be
his
property.
but
once
that
issue
is
reached,
then,
of
course,
we
have
to
consider
whether
the
per
se
taking
rule
applies.
if
not,
then
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
investment-backed
expectation
would
be
one
of
a
number
of
factors
that
would
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
whether
there
is
a
taking,
but
i
don't
believe
that
we
need
to
show
that
there
was
any
kind
of
reasonable
investment-backed
expectation
in
order
to
prevail
on
the
issue
today,
which
is
whether
or
not
this
is
property
in
the
first
place.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
the
banking
industry
has
always
been
subject
to
regulation,
and
if
they
are
prohibited
from
paying
interest,
we
don't
claim
that
we
would
have
any
sort
of
claim.
however,
banks
are
ready,
willing,
and
able
to
pay
interest.
they
compete
actively
for
the
money
of
depositors.
they
want
to
have
this
money
in
order
to
be
able
to
lend
it
out
to
others.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
any
interest
that
is
paid
follows
principal.
that
is
the
rule.
if
it
is
not
paid,
then
there
is
no
right
to
accrued
interest
for
the
use
of
one's
money,
and
we
don't
claim
that
that's
any
kind
of
constitutional
right.
going
back
to
your
question,
justice
scalia,
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
very
easy
to
foresee
many
examples
where
the
government,
for
example,
might
come
in
and
say
that
you're
not
gardening
in
your
backyard,
why
don't
we
come
in
and
grow
a
vegetable
garden
there.
and
i'd
say,
well,
i
want
to
exclude
you,
and
they
say,
well,
it
would
cost
you
too
much
to
buy
the
fertilizer
for
the
backyard,
so
you
can't
do
it
profitably,
but
we
buy
our
fertilizer
in
bulk,
so
we
can
do
it
more
profitably,
let
us
use
it
since
you're
not
doing
it
otherwise,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
a
decision
that
this
is
not
property
would--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--and
i--
mr.
richard
a.
samp
--the...
it's
not
the
constitution,
it
is
common
law
and
state
law
that
has
always
said
that
the
earnings
of
a
fund,
the
earnings
of
property
are
the
property
of
those
who
own
the
fund
that
generate
it.
just
as,
because
i
own
the
garden,
i
own
the
vegetables
that
are
produced
from
it,
so,
too,
because
i
own
the
fund,
i
own
the
interest
that
is
generated
by
my
fund.
mr.
richard
a.
samp
the
government
hasn't
even...
the
government
has
said
to
the
lawyers,
you
don't
even
have
to
tell
me,
so
i
don't
even
know
that
you're
in
my
backyard.
i've
gone
off
on
vacation,
and
i
come
back,
and
all
of
a
sudden--
[laughter]
--the
yard
is
occupied.
thank
you
very
much.
