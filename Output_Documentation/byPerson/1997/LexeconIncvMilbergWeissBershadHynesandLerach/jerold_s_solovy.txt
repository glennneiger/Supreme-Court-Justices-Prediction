mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
position
of
the
respondents
that
30
years
of
multidistrict
panel
litigation
has
served
the
country
well,
as
has...
was
intended
by
the
murrah
committee,
and
was
intended
by
the
judicial
conference,
and
was
intended
by
congress
in
enacting
this
act.
i
want
to
dispel
one
false
issue,
and
that
is
the
issue
of
prejudice
of
trying
this
case
in
arizona.
this
case,
of
course,
did
reek
of
arizona
because
it
was
all
about
the
lincoln
savings
case,
which
was
tried
in
arizona,
services
performed
by
lexecon
in
arizona,
but
this
prejudice
issue
that
somehow
they
could
not
get
a
fair
trial
in
arizona
is
only
a
concept
by
judge
kozinski,
because
it
was
never
raised
by
petitioners
before
judge
roll
in
the
district
court
before
the
trial.
indeed,
the--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--i
do
contest
that,
but
that's--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that's
a
different
issue,
your
honor.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no
more
favorable,
your
honor,
but
that
issue,
justice
scalia,
was
never
raised.
indeed,
they
didn't
even
have
the
voir
dire
transcribed,
so--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that's
what
section...
this
case,
number
1,
is
supposed
to
involve
1407
and
not
1404.
1404,
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum,
they
tried
to
elevate
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
as
sacrosanct,
and
they
cite
gulf
oil.
the
trouble
with
gulf
oil
is
that's
a
forum
non
conveniens
case
which
was
overruled
by
1404.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
the
olberding
case,
your
honor,
is
a
improper
venue
statute
where
the
improper
venue
person
was
the
defendant,
not
the
plaintiff.
the
whole
purpose...
this
is
a
case
which
always
could
have
been
brought
in
arizona,
and
there
was
jurisdiction
there.
arizona
said
this
is
not
an
improper
venue
case.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
but
that's
what
1404,
mr.
chief
justice,
does.
1404
makes
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
justice
ginsburg,
section
1404
involves
an
article
iii
judge
making
a
determination
of
where
the
case
can
best
be
tried.
in
this
case,
that
determination
was
made
by
the
article
iii
judge,
judge
roll
in
arizona,
and
he
transferred
the
case
to
where
it
had
been
filed
and
otherwise
would
have
been
tried
from
illinois
to
arizona,
and
i
don't--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--the
transferor...
the
case
was
transferred
from
the
district
of
illinois
where
it
would
otherwise
have
been
trialed
to
the
district
of
arizona.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i
think,
you
know,
it
depends
whether
you're
looking
at
this
in
some
metaphysical
sense.
i
think
within
the
language
of
section
1404
you
have
the
case
being
transferred
from
the
district
of...
northern
district
of
illinois
to
the
district
of
arizona,
and
it
so
happens
that
the
person
issuing
that
order
is
the
transferee
judge,
and
i
would
like
to
step
back--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
your
decision
in
korean
air
lines
is
quite
to
the
contrary,
because
i
don't
think
the
transferee
court
has
a
duty
to
put
his
or
her
mind
into
the
mind
of
the
transferor
court.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
we
don't
know
what
judge
zagel
would
have
done.
he
might
have
been
happy
to
get
rid
of
this
case.
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
i
can't
read
his
mind.
but
let's
step
back
for
a
moment
and
look
at
the
purpose
of
1407,
this
statute
that
has
worked
so
well
for
the
last
29
years,
handling
over
100,000
cases.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
think,
justice--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes.
it
says
that--
[laughter]
--unless
the
case
is
otherwise
terminated,
and
i
was
surprised
mr.
kellogg--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--we
say--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
but
this
court...
you
know,
termination
is...
has
to
be
used
in
a
practical,
common
sense--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--it
means
ended--
[laughter]
no,
it
means
ended
temporally
and
i'm
looking
for--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--temporally.
temporally.
it
was
suspended--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
it's
ended
as
a
multidistrict
litigation.
for
example,
this
court
in
eeoc
v.
commercial
office
products,
48...
486
u.s.
107,
had
to
deal
with
the
word
terminated
in
the
eeoc
case.
in
order
to
have...
meet
the
statute
of
limitations
the
question
is
whether
a
state,
quote,
terminated
its
proceeding
when
it
gave
the
case
back
to
the
eeoc,
but
it
really
only
suspended,
and
this
court
in
that
case
says
you
have
to
use
it,
that
word
terminated
in
a
common
sense
way
and
give
effect
to
the
statute.
and
by
interpreting
terminated
to
mean
terminated
as
an
mdl
proceeding,
we
give
effect
not
only
to
1407(a),
but
to
1407(b),
because
1407(b)
also
says
in
mandatory
language
that
the
transferee
judge
shall
conduct
pretrial
proceedings...
shall
conduct
pretrial
proceedings...
and
if
we
want
to
know
what
congress
meant
we
only
have
to
look
at
what
the
murrah
committee
meant,
because
as
professor
wright
says
in
his
amicus
brief
it's
fiction
here
to
say
what
congress
meant,
because
this
was
all
engineered
by
the
murrah
committee
in
the
judicial
conference.
congress
passed
this
statute
with
only
two
changes
suggested
by
the
department
of
justice,
one
to
exempt
government
antitrust
cases
from
the
statute,
and
two,
originally
the
murrah
committee
suggested
that
the
transferor
court
would
have
to
consent
to
the
transfer.
they
took
that
out,
so
any
proprietary
interest
of
the
transferor
court
disappears.
now,
we
have
within
8
months
after
the
passage
of
this
act
a
case
called
in
re
plumbing
fixtures,
which
we
cite
at
pages
19
and
26
of
our
brief,
and
there,
judge
becker,
talking
for
the
entire
panel,
which
was
a
panel,
you
know,
of
distinguished
jurors,
judge
wisdom,
murrah,
becker,
et
cetera,
in
that
case
the
petitioner,
like
the
petitioner
here,
said
that
the
transferee
court
could
not
pass
upon
class
action
issues.
that
had
to
be
passed
upon
only
by
the
transferor
court.
and
the
panel
said,
well,
number
1,
let's
look
at
the
legislative
history.
the
legislative
history
rejected
the
suggestion
that
only
discovery
matters
be
handled
by
the
transferee
court.
all
pretrial
proceedings
must
be
handled
by
the
transferee
judge.
the
court
said,
number
2,
look
at
the
house
and
senate
report.
it
says
that
pretrial
proceedings
means
everything
a
judge
does
up
to
a
trial.
it
said,
also--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
because,
justice
scalia--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--because
in
re
plumbing
fixtures
says
that
what
this
pretrial
proceedings
means,
and
it
says
the
plain
language
of
pretrial
proceedings
means
everything
up
to
a
trial,
which
includes
a
motion
to
dismiss,
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
class
certification,
and
it
also
inexorably
means
a
motion
to
transfer.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
justice
scalia--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
if
it
can
pass
upon
it,
inexorably
it
has
to
grant
it
or
deny
it.
i
mean,
what's
the
purpose--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--that's
correct,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
it's
no
longer
an
mdl
proceeding.
you
see,
rule
14(b)
of
the
mdl
panel,
the
expert
body
that
administers
this
act,
says
if
a
motion
to
transfer
is
granted
either
to
some
other
court
or
to
the
transferee
court,
then
no
further
order
of
the
panel
is
needed
and
the
case
is
concluded
as
an
mdl
case.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that
would
be
correct,
but
that
would
be
highly
unusual.
let's
take
the
normal
case.
let's
take
an
airplane
crash
case,
because
that's
a
normal
mdl
case.
the
plane
crashes
in
iowa.
the
mdl
panel
gives
it
to
a
judge
in
chicago,
and
they're...
you're
going
to
get
all
sorts
of
motions.
you're
going
to
get
discovery
motions,
you're
going
to
get
statute
of
limitations
issues,
you're
going
to
get
hague
convention
issues,
you're
going
to
get
all
sorts
of
issues
passed,
and
somewhere
along
these
proceedings
somebody's
going
to
file,
say
in
the
2-year
mark,
a
motion
to
transfer,
and
that
transferee
judge
is
going
to
say,
okay,
number
1,
could
i
transfer
this
case
to
myself?
are
the
provisions
of
1404
complied
with?
in
many
instances
they
won't
be,
because
the
case
could
not...
that
case
could
not
have
been
brought
in
the
district
of
chicago,
so
that
transferee
judge
could
transfer
some
of
those
cases
to
himself,
or
he
could
transfer
it
to
other
places.
the
pfizer,
on
which
retired
justice
clark
sat,
said
you
have
to
have
the
transferee
judge
rule
upon
motions
to
transfer,
otherwise
the
transfer
issue
is
going
to
be
in
limbo
during
the
entire
existence
of
these
mdl
proceedings,
because--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--the
debate
in
congress,
if
there
was
a
debate,
was
not
whether
a
district
court
could
exercise...
a
transferee
court
could
exercise
traditional
1404
powers,
because
in
the
electrical
equipment
cases
they
issued
1404
orders.
the
question
was
whether
the
panel
could
have
the
supertransfer
power
not
only
for
pretrial
but
for
trial,
because
remember,
the
panel
can
ship
the
case
to
a
court
without
jurisdiction
and
a
court
without
venue.
that's
entirely
different
than
a
1404
motion,
and
the
debate
was
never,
could
the
transferee
court
transfer
cases,
because
the
murrah
committee
knew
they
had
done
so
in
the
electrical
equipment
cases.
this
system
can't
work--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
that's
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
if
that's--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--all
right.
let's
attack
it
step
by
step,
okay.
the
first
step
is
on
what
did
the
murrah
committee
intend?
well,
number
1,
you
know,
we
do
have
the
little
experiment
that
you
normally
wouldn't
have.
you
wouldn't
have
congress
talking
right
away,
but
you
have
congress
talking
through
the
murrah
committee
almost
immediately
in
the
plumbing
fixtures
case.
that's
8
months
after
congress
adopted
this
act,
and
they
say
what
they
mean.
number
2,
justice
breyer,
we
cite
at
page--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
because,
justice
ginsburg,
as
even
professor
wright
says,
the
fact...
what
congress
intended
here
is
fiction.
congress
took
what
the
murrah
committee
submitted
to
them
and
crafted
and
adopted
it,
and
so
if
you
want
to
get
at
least
in
the
minds
of
the
people
who
drafted
the
statute,
namely
the
murrah
committee,
you
but
have
to
look
at
the
plumbing
fixtures
case.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
but--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--justice
breyer,
if
you'll
allow
me
to
defer
for
a
second
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
what
they
said
was,
not
only
1407(a)
but
1407(b),
which
mandates
that
the
transferee
judge
shall
conduct
pretrial
proceedings,
in
the
plumbing
fixture
case
there's
a
sort
of
a
ironic
heading
which
says
that
construction
of
the
plain
meaning
of
section
1407,
which
they
thought
was
plain
then,
and
they
said
that
the
language
of
1407(b)
is
mandatory,
and
number
2,
it
says
that
in
transfer
statutes,
whether
it's
1404(a)
or
1407,
the
transferee
judge
can
issue
any
order,
make
any
judgment,
do
anything
that
the
transferor
judge
could
do.
you
have
sort
of,
in
property
sense,
a
livery
of
caesar.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
they...
judge
becker,
judge--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--he
was.
he
wasn't
in
congress,
but
he
testified
before
the--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
of
course,
chief
justice,
it's
quite
different,
but
they
are
the
persons
that
crafted
the
statute.
they
are
the
persons
who
congress
gave
the
authority
to
administer
the
statute,
so
i
think
their
views
are
quite
influential
and
you
know,
we're
dealing
with
30
years
of
precedent
where
no
one
ever
dreamed
up
this
argument
before.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
justice
scalia,
i'm
a
believer
here
that
the
murrah
committee
crafted
this,
that
this
is
quite
influential,
but
you
draw
from
it
what
you
wish,
but
here
is
a
contemporaneous
decision.
but
let
me
go--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
all
right.
justice
breyer,
if
i
can
remember
your
question,
it's
twofold:
a)
is,
mr.
solovy,
the
murrah
committee
promised
it
would
go
back.
that
is
not
correct.
the
murrah
committee
repeatedly
said
it
will
go
back
unless
1404
is
utilized,
okay,
so
that's...
i
mean,
at
page
25
of
our
brief
it
says
1407
would
not
affect
the
place
of
the
trial
in
any
case
or
exclude
the
possibility
of
transfer
under
other
federal
statutes.
at
page
27
of
our
brief--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
obviously--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--i
don't
think
it's
a
tough
issue,
because
it's
the
transferee
judge,
1407(b)
says
that
a
transferee
judge
must
conduct
pretrial
proceedings.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
i
don't
believe
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
because
in
the
electrical
equipment
cases
which
spawned
this
litigation,
section
1404
motions
were
used
to
expedite
these
cases,
and
as
pfizer
says,
if
you
don't
have
the
transferee
judge
have
the
ability
to
transfer
the
case,
then
you're
going
to
throw
this
whole
statute
up
in
havoc,
because
now
the
case
inheres...
my
air
crash
case,
it
inheres
in
chicago
for
4
years.
you've
got
40
different
cases,
and
the
transferee
judge
says
it
makes
sense
to
have
this
case
tried
in
the
northern
district
of
iowa.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well,
but--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--no,
because
in
most
mdl
cases
you're
going
to
have
to--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
you
have
to
ship
it
back--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--not
practically,
because
in
my
air
crash
case,
justice
souter,
you've
got
24
different
cases
in
different
parts
of
the
country,
and
that's
exactly
what
they
are
trying
to
overcome
in
the
electrical
equipment
cases,
because
you
couldn't
get
these
judges
to
coordinate.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
justice
breyer--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--correct.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
well--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--yes.
let's
talk
about
that
before
my
time
here
on
earth
elapses,
okay.
number
1,
we
say
the
1404
issue
is
not
encompassed
in
the
question
presented,
because
the
question
presented
deals
with
1407
and
not
14...
(a),
1404(a).
but
assuming
it
does,
this
court
has
held
in
continental
grain
that
1404
is
a
common
sense--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--continental
grain,
your
honor.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
yes.
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
i
hope...
that
it's
a
common
sense
statute,
and
number
2,
in
the
piper
aircraft
case,
454
u.s.
235,
at
253,
254,
this
court
said
of
1404,
justice
breyer,
that
it
is
a
federal
housekeeping
measure
allowing
easy
change
of
venue
in
a
unified
federal
system,
and
what
we
have
is
a
unified
federal
system
and
you
want
to
make
changes
of
venue,
if
it's
in
the
interest
of
justice,
work
well.
and
to
show
that
this
court
was
common
sense,
in
the
koehring
case,
which
we
also
cite
in
our
brief,
this
court
interpreted
the
power
of
the
district
court
to
issue
a
1404
transfer
into
the
power
of
an
appellate
court
to
issue
a
1404
transfer.
now,
that's
surely
not
within
the
literal
language
of
1404,
but
it
made
good
common
sense.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
this
does
not
involve
venue--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--absolutely
correct,
and
in
either
court,
and
bear
in
mind,
section
1406,
let's
not
forget
1406.
even
a
judge
without
venue
could
issue
a
transfer
order,
so
this--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
you
have
to
go
through...
you
know,
you
have
to
go
through
the
hoops.
you
have
to
file--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--you
have
to
file
the
motion,
but
here--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--let
me
answer
the
question
this
way,
justice
scalia.
i
know
of
no
case
where
they
have
an
error-free
trial,
as
this
one,
where
the
court
who
tried
the
case
had
venue
and
jurisdiction,
and
the
case
gets
reversed
for
a
new
trial--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--very
seldom,
justice
scalia,
and
for
good
reason,
because
you
know,
venue
will
seldom
be
an
error...
if
it
be
an
error
in
a
1404
motion
it's
going
to
seldom
be
overturned
because
it's
not
substantial.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
no.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
i
don't,
either,
and
for
good
reason,
and
that's
why
we
get
into
section
2111,
which
is
also
mandatory
in
terms.
this
court
is
directed
to
give
effect
to
judgment
where
there
has
not
been
any
substantial
prejudice
to
the
petitioner,
and--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--it
might
be,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
this
isn't
a
case
of
improper
venue.
venue
lied
in
the
district
of
arizona.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
laid.
thank
you
very
much,
and--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--it
was
to
another
district.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
because
judge
lord
was
sitting
by
designation.
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
in
new
york,
and
that's
the
other
beauty
of
the
statute.
the
judges
can
be,
you
know,
shipped
around
through
the
country,
and
in
woops,
for
example,
judge
browning
was
designated
to
sit
in
seattle.
he
transferred
the
case
for
trial
to
himself
in
tucson.
it
made
a
lot
of
sense
to
try
that
case
there.
so
in
pfizer,
it
was
a
transfer
to
another
district
because
judge
lord...
but
he
really
transferred
it
to
himself,
because
he
transferred
it
to
himself
for
trial
in
minnesota.
now--
mr.
jerold
s.
solovy
--well,
but
they
did
not...
they
didn't
ever
do
the
correct
thing,
because
it's
ironic
again
here,
they
lay
upon
the
mandatory
language
of
shall
remand,
but
they
never
went
back
to
the
panel
and
said,
please
remand
the
case
to
illinois.
my
time
has
expired.
thank
you
very
much.
