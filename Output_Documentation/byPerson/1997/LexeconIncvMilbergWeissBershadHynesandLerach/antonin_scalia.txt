justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
congress
might
be...
might
have
been
willing
to
allow
a
court
to
deny
itself
jurisdiction
over
the
case
but
not
allow
a
court
to
obtain
jurisdiction
that
it
otherwise
wouldn't
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
import
is
that
transferring
to
yourself
is
grasping
jurisdiction.
transferring
to
someone
else
is
denying
yourself
jurisdiction,
a
much...
it's
not
as
likely
to
be
motivated
by
bad
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kellogg,
i
assume
that
if
it's
not
reversible,
then
we
would
have
to
allow
interlocutory
appeals
on
venue
questions.
do
you
know
whether
interlocutory
appeals
are
possible
on
venue
questions?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
interlocutory
appeals
statute.
well,
they'd
be
appealable
if
they
were
not
reviewable
on
appeal.
i
mean--
--you
would
have
to
have
the
certification
first
from
the
trial
judge.
you'd
have
to
agree--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
mandamus.
it
seems
to
me
we
have
to
allow
it
to
be
reviewed
at
some
point,
or
you
may
as
well
throw
the
statute
away.
it's
either
reviewable
interlocutorily,
or
it's
reviewable
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
such
a
thing
as
law
of
the
case,
isn't
there?
i
mean,
if
you've
gotten
the
issue
decided
on
the
way
up,
they--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
that
they
said
he
couldn't
get
a
fair
trial.
they
just
didn't
think
that
was
as
advantageous
a
forum
for
them,
and
was
a
much
more
advantageous
forum
for
you.
do
you
contest
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
the
jury
there
was
no
more
likely
to
be
favorable
to
your
client
than
it
would
have
been
in
chicago,
where
lexecon
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
of
transferring
it
because
there
was
excess...
so
much
prejudice
that
the
verdict
would
be
set
aside
for
prejudice
is
one
thing,
but
whether
there
was
a
substantial
motive
to
move
it
to
another
forum
that
was
more
advantageous,
although
you
couldn't
say
it
would
be
an
unfair
trial,
is
quite
a
different
issue--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
latter
issue
that
he's
raising.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
this?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
issue
is
not
that
the
arizona
court
terminated
the
proceeding
by
granting
summary
judgment.
they
didn't
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
transferred
the
proceeding
to
themselves.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
of
course
it
means
that.
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
court
can
rule
on
a
motion
to
transfer.
the
question
is
whether
it
can
grant
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
get
where
you
want
to
go
by
saying
that
the
transfer,
that
the
court
to
which
the
panel
has
given
the
case
may
pass
upon
that
question.
of
course
it
may.
that's
a
pretrial
question
like
a
lot
of
other
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
is
whether
it
may
grant
the
motion.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
about
as
influential
as
testimony
by
the
justice
department
on
a
bill
that's
later
adopted
and
administered
by
the
justice
department.
there
are
some
opinions
that
refer
to
that
testimony,
but
it's
not
overwhelmingly
persuasive,
is
it,
even
to
those
who
believe
that
congress
does
not
act
in
its
statutes
but
in
its
committees.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
solovy,
are
you
going
back
to
justice
breyer's--
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
that
the
plaintiff
brings
an
action
with
proper
venue
in
district
a,
and
the
defendant
doesn't
like
district
a,
so
he
simply
seeks
to
bring
the
court
in
district
z.
now,
is
it
your
contention
that
venue
is
not
involved
when
he
runs
to
district
z
and
the
court
in
district
z
can
take
the
case
if
the
court
in
district
z
takes
the
case?
so
long
as
venue
could
have
lain
there
it
doesn't
matter
whether
district
a
transferred
it
or
not,
venue
is
proper,
just
because
the
defendant
runs
over
there
and
says,
please
take
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
you
don't
go
through
the
hoops,
venue
is
improper.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
venue
improper
in
district
z
so
long
as
it
was
not
properly
transferred
to
district
z,
even
though
it
could
have
been
brought
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
wouldn't
you
say
venue
is
improper?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
in
which
an
interlocutory
appeal
has
been
allowed
where
venue
is
challenged?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
very
seldom.
do
you
know
any
case?
