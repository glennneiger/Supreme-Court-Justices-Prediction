mr.
solovy,
can
i
ask
one...
may
i
ask
just
one
question?
in
pfizer
was...
did
the...
was
the
transfer
to
the
court
itself
or
to
another
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
you
would
take
the
same
position
if
the
transfer
had
been
to
a
different
district?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
your
basic
position,
and
it's
consistent
with
the
question
presented
in
the
cert
petition,
doesn't
really
rely
on
1404.
your
primary
submission
is
the
1407
submission.
