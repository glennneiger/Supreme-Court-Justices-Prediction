mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
congress
passed
the
multidistrict
litigation
statute
in
1968
as
an
experiment
for
a
limited
purpose.
it
wanted
to
allow
cases
with
common
facts
filed
around
the
country
to
be
consolidated
in
a
single
district
for
coordinated
pretrial
proceedings.
such
coordinated
pretrial
proceedings
promote
judicial
efficiency
as
well
as
the
efficiency
of
the
parties
by
allowing
for
single
rounds
of
discovery
and
single
rounds
of
document
requests.
but
congress
was
quite
specific
that
at
the
conclusion
of
those
coordinated
pretrial
proceedings
the
case
must
be
remanded
to
the
original
district.
i
quote
here
from
section
1407(a),
which
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
our
brief.
each
action
so
transferred
shall
be
remanded
by
the
panel
at
or
before
the
conclusion
of
such
pretrial
proceedings,
unless
it
shall
have
been
previously
terminated.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that
is
section
1404(a),
which
is
the
general
transfer
statute,
pursuant
to
which
the
district
of
arizona
transferred
this
case
to
itself.
this
case
originated
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
it
was
transferred
pursuant
to
1407(a)
for
coordinated
pretrial
proceedings
in
the
district
of
arizona.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
should
have
been
remanded
at
the
time
specified
in
the
statute,
which
is
at
or
before
the
conclusion
of
such
pretrial
proceedings.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
appropriate
time--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
appropriate
time
in
this
case
is
at
the
time
that
lexicon
made
its
motion
to
remand,
because
the
various
factors
cited--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
the
multidistrict
panel
cited
three
factors
as
reasons
for
sending
this
case
to
arizona.
one
was
the
pendency
of
the
potentially
related
appeal.
the
second
was
the
existence
of
a
document
depository
in
arizona,
and
the
third
was
the
fact
that
there
was
an
unfinished
settlement
in
the
lincoln
savings
litigation.
each
of
those
three
factors
had
been
eliminated.
the
appeal
had
been
dismissed,
the
document
depository
had
been
shut
down,
and
lincoln
savings
had
final
judgment--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that
is
correct.
at
the
time
we
made
our
motion--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no
determination
had
been
made.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
not
pursuant
to
the
statute,
your
honor.
the
statute
specifically
states
that
at
or
before
the
conclusion
of
a
consolidated
pretrial
proceeding
the
case
must
be
remanded,
and
we
made
our
motion
at
that--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
because
venue
is
like
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
the
sense
that
if
it
is
not
waived
the
case
must
be
reversed
afterwards.
that
was
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that
was
the
holding
of
this
court
in
the
olberding
case.
it
was
repeated
again
in
the
schnell
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
this
is
a
case
of
wrong
venue,
justice
ginsburg,
even
though
respondents
argued
that
we
could
have
filed
the
case
in
the
district
of
arizona,
but
the
fact
remains,
we
did
not
file
the
case
in
the
district
of
arizona.
exercising
a
long-held
right,
we
decided
to
file
this
case
in
the
northern
district
of
chicago.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
at
the
time
it
was
transferred
to
the
northern
district...
to
arizona,
it
was
transferred
only
for
coordinated
and
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings
pursuant
to
1407(a),
and
the
statute
specifies
that
at
the
conclusion
of
those
proceedings
the
case
must
be
remanded.
that
means
venue
was
improper
in
the
district
of
arizona.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
summary
judgment
in
appropriate
circumstances
could
be
granted
by
the
transferee
court.
in
this
instance--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--pardon?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
the
appropriate
circumstances
where
it's
part
of
coordinated,
consolidated
pretrial--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--right.
for
example,
if
there's
a
common
issue
of
law
that
spans
across
all
the
cases,
or
a
common
issue
of
fact,
the
court
might
well,
pursuant
to
coordinated
and
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings,
grant
summary
judgment.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
statute
says
consolidated
and
coordinated,
so
the
cases
are
brought
together.
they
are
consolidated,
but
the
idea
is
to
connect
coordinated
pretrial
proceedings,
and
the
statute's
absolutely
explicit
that
at
the
conclusion
of
those
proceedings
the
case
has
to
go
back.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
key
point
for
our
case
is
that
there
is
a
durational
limitation
built
into
1407(a).
it
says
that
the
transferee
court
gets
the
case
for
a
limited
period
of
time
to
conduct
coordinated
or
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings.
now,
in
my
view,
that
means
it's
specific
proceedings
that
cover
all
those
various
cases,
that
span
across
the
cases,
but
the
key
point
for
this
case
is
that
there's
a
durational
limitation.
no
one
disputes
that
at
the
time
lexecon
made
its
motion
to
remand
there
was
no
prospect
of
any
future
coordinated
or
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings
in
this
case.
the
statute
therefore
is
quite
explicit
that
the
case
has
to
be
remanded.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
agree
that
the
jpml
rule--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--allows
for
it.
what--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
rule
is
directly
contrary
to
the
statute.
what
the
jpml
has
done
is
taken
a
statute
with
a
single
specific
exception...
it
says,
the
case
shall
be
remanded
unless
it
has
been
previously
terminated,
and
what
the
jpml
has
done
is
said,
well,
it
has
to
be
remanded
unless
it's
been
terminated
or
unless
the
district
court
has
transferred
the
case
to
itself
pursuant
to
1404(a).
so
they've
read
a
second
exception
into
the
statute
that
completely
swallows
the
rule,
because
essentially
what
they've
done
is
says,
the
case
has
to
be
remanded
unless
the
district
court
decides
not
to
remand
it.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
transferee
court,
in
this
case
the
district
of
arizona,
was
not
free
to
assign
the
case
to
itself,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
under
the
rule
it
is,
but
the
rule
is
invalid.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
that's
for
two
reasons.
first
it
makes
nonsense
of
the
shall-be-remanded
language,
and
second,
the
invocation
of
1404
was
itself
improper,
because
1404
specifies
that
a
case
may
be
transferred
to
any
other
district
court.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
if
you
read
the
language
closely,
and
it's
set
out
at
page
2
of
our
brief,
it
says
specifically,
for
the
convenience
of
parties
and
witnesses
in
the
interests
of
justice
a
district
court
may
transfer
any
civil
action
to
any
other
district
or
division
where
it
might
have
been
brought.
now,
the
only
way
to
make
sense
of
that
language
is
that
the
district
court
that
does
the
transferring,
the
subject
of
the
sentence,
is
other
than
the
district
that
receives
the
case,
the
other
district
which
is
the
indirect
object
of
that
sentence.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
says
district
or
division.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
could
be--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--to
a
different
division
within
the
same
district,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
but
in
the
absence--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
believe
that's
correct.
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
the
import
of
that.
under
1404
a
self-transfer
is
in
our
view
oxymoronic,
because
no
transfer
is
taking
place.
the
district
of
arizona
is
simply
asserting
continued
authority
over
the
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
there's
a
built-in
safeguard
there.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it's
only
a
question
that,
under
the
strict
language
of
1404
the
transfer
has
to
be
to
some
other
district.
a
court
who
merely
asserts
jurisdiction
over
the
course...
case
and
says,
i'm
going
to
keep
it
for
all
purposes,
is
not
transferring
the
case
within
the
meaning
of
1404,
and
there's
no
reason
to
distort
the
language
of
1404,
which
was
passed
in
1947
at
a
time
when
the
prospect
of
self-transferring
did
not
even
exist,
because
the
multidistrict
litigation
statute
was
not
passed
until
1968,
in
which
case
a
court
for
the
first
time
could
get
a
case
for
limited
purposes,
but
expressly
has
to
remand
that
at
the
conclusion
of
those
purposes
and
cannot
bootstrap
that
authority
by
holding
onto
a
case--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
first
of
all,
let
me
point
out
that
we
sought
mandamus
before
the
trial
in
the
ninth
circuit.
respondents
specifically
took
the
position
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
mandamus
because
we
had
a
complete
remedy
on
appeal,
and
the
ninth
circuit
agreed
with
that
position.
they
said
specifically
this
issue
can
be
raised
and
the
problem
corrected
on
direct
appeal.
we
obviously
invoked
that
right,
under
the
court's
cases,
under
olberding
and
schnell,
specifically
have
a
right
to
invoke
our
venue
rights,
and
then
you
can--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
i
think
caterpillar
actually
plays
very
well
into
our
argument,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
of
course,
caterpillar
had
nothing
to
do
with
venue.
it
had,
as
you
said,
to
do
with
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
secondly,
and
more
importantly,
the
flaw
in
caterpillar
was
cured
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
subject
matter
jurisdiction
did
adhere
because
the
nondiverse
party
had
been
dismissed.
here,
the
venue
flaw
was
not
corrected
at
the
time
of
trial.
it
continued
throughout
the
entire
case,
and
continues
to
affect
the
case
on
appeal.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
if
you
agree
with
us--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--i
don't
think
you
actually
need
to
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
error
is
harmless
or
not.
you
granted
certiorari
to
determine
whether
the
practice
of
self-transfer
is
permitted
under
1407(a)
and
under
1404(a).
all
you
have
to
do
is
vindicate
the
precise
language
of
those
statutes
and
remand
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--actually,
that's
not
true.
he
could
not
assign
it
to
a
second
district
court.
under
the
language
of
1404,
sure,
it
would
be
a
transfer
to
another
district
court,
but
it
would
still
violate
the
express
mandate
of
1407(a)
that
the
case
shall
be
remanded
to
the
original
court
where
it
was
filed.
see,
1404
and
1407
are
alternative
mechanisms.
they're
strategic
choices
that
a
defendant
can
make
at
the
time
that
a
case
is
filed.
if
they
think
they
can
satisfy
the
requirements
for
a
1404
transfer
for
all
purposes,
then
they
can
make
such
a
motion.
if
not,
and
they
think
coordinated
proceedings
would
be
appropriate,
they
can
make
a
1407
motion.
what
they
can't
do
is
what
happened
here,
is
make
a
1407
motion
and
then
bootstrap
it
into
being
held
for
all
purposes
under
1404(a).
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
but
it
is
available
to
the
original
court
when
the
case
is
filed,
so
it
was
available--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
that
would
be
a
direct
violation.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no,
i
think
i'm
making
a
somewhat
different
point,
justice
o'connor.
first
of
all,
i'm
making
the
point
that
1407--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--justice
ginsburg.
i
apologize.
the
first
point
i'm
making
is
that
section
1407
specifically
says
that
the
case
shall
be
remanded.
that's
a
later
statute,
a
specific
statute
dealing
with
this
instance,
and
therefore
the
case
has
to
be
remanded.
the
second
point
about
1404
is,
this
sort
of
self-transfer
doesn't
fit
the
language
of
1404,
and
my
point
is
that
you
should
not
jerry
rig
these
two
statutes
together,
which
were
never
intended
to
work
in
tandem,
to
reach
a
result
that
congress
clearly
did
not
intend.
not
only
is
the
language
of
1407
clear,
the
legislative
history,
if
one
needs
to
resort
to
that,
is
absolutely
clear.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes,
it
could
have.
in
this
case
that
never
would
have
happened.
none
of
the
parties
to
this
case
were
from
arizona.
none
of
the
witnesses
were
in
arizona.
none
of
the
lead
counsel
were
in
arizona,
none
of
the
documents.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
as
a
matter
of
discretion
a
1404
transfer
would
never
have
been
granted
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
let
me--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--we've
cited,
actually,
the
relevant
harmless
error
cases
in
our
brief.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
the
reply
brief--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--there
are
a
number
of
cases
holding
that
venue
errors
are
not
harmless
error.
there's
the
olberding
case,
when
the
court
quite
specifically...
and
i'm
quoting
here
from
olberding.
unless
the
defendant
has
also
consented
to
be
sued
in
that
district,
he
has
a
right
to
invoke
the
protection
that
congress
has
afforded.
in
the
schnell
case,
8
years
later,
the
court
reiterated
that
point
and
said,
look,
there
are
some
people
who
thinks
that's
exalting
form
over
substance,
but
it's
not.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
we've
had
a
trial--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
reason
why
it's
important
is
that
the
venue
was
improper.
the
defect
in
the
trial,
unlike
caterpillar,
was
never
cured.
this
trial
was
held--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it's
an
important
defect
in
this
case
for
two
reasons,
first
of
all
because
respondents
tried
so
hard
to
get
this
case
to
the
district
of
arizona
because
of
popular
prejudice
and
strong
feelings
about
the
lincoln
savings
matter
and
charles
keating
in
particular,
and
were
relying
on
the
fact
that
anyone
associated
with,
or
alleged
to
be
associated
with
charles
keating
was
essentially
going
to
get
lynched
by
a
jury
in
arizona,
and
as
judge
kozinski
said,
they
peppered
their
trial
arguments
with
references
to
keating's
misdeeds
and
with
references
to
the
lincoln
savings
debacle.
a
second
reason
is
that
judge
zagel,
to
whom
this
case
had
been
assigned
in
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
had
specifically
rejected
their
argument
that
judge
bilby's
orders
in
the
lincoln
savings
case
somehow
had
a
preclusive
effect
on
parts
of
this
litigation.
when
the
case
was
transferred
to
arizona,
judge
bilby's
colleague
immediately
gave
preclusive
effect
to
judge
zagel's
ruling,
so
in
this
case
there
was
substantial
prejudice.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
no.
it's
always
good
to
have
a
fallback--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--and
as
a
fallback
we
can
show
prejudice,
but
we
do
not
require
to.
venue
is
always--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--my
understanding
is
that
they
are
not,
that
you
only
have
resort
to
mandamus--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--sorry.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
1292
being--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--you'd
have
to,
and
it
would
have
to
be
not
reviewable
on
appeal,
which
means
that
you
would
end
up
with
a
lot
of
appeals
raising
this
issue
on
an
interlocutory
status
and
therefore
delaying--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
exactly
the
point,
and
it's
another
source
of
difference
from
the
caterpillar
decision,
justice
ginsburg,
where
the
court
said
we're
not
concerned
that
wrongful
removals
are
going
to
proliferate
in
that
instance
because
the
chances
of
the
defect
being
cured
by
the
time
of
trial
are
so
small
that
nobody's
going
to
take
the
chance.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--but
the
court
has
specifically
held
that
this
one
is
reviewable,
unless
you
want
to
overrule--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--olberding
and
schnell
as
well
as
distorting
what
i
think
was
the
clear
import
of
the
opinion
in
caterpillar.
again--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no.
there
is
a
specific
provision
in
the
jpml
statute,
the
multidistrict
statute
that
says
orders
of
the
panel
are
only
reviewable
via
mandamus.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
any
order
of
the
panel.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--in
this
instance,
of
course,
we're
not
challenging
an
order
of
the
panel.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
if
it
is--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
as
professor
wright
explained
in
his
amicus
brief,
this
is
like
subject
matters
jurisdiction
except
that
it's
waivable,
but
where
it's
not
waived
the
decision
has
to
be
reversed
on
appeal.
let
me--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
if
we
had
had
an
interlocutory
appeal
and
lost?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
guess
that's...
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
the
general
rule
is
on
interlocutory
appeals
and
review
afterwards.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
but
in
any
event,
in
this
case
we
were
specifically
told
by
the
court
of
appeals
to
raise
it
on
direct
appeal.
we
did
so.
i
just
want
to
take
30
seconds
to
give
one
more
reason
why
a
caterpillar
result
does
not
hold
here.
in
caterpillar
the
court
specifically
stressed
that
the
result
was
in
harmony,
ultimately,
with
the
subject
matter
jurisdiction
statutes.
here,
by
contrast,
the
result
is
directly
contrary
to
congress'
judgment
that
even
if
some
efficiency
is
sacrificed
by
sending
the
case
back
to
the
original
district
it
still
has
to
be
remanded.
that
was
the
direct
command
of
congress,
and
to
set
aside
that,
to
say
it's
harmless
error
because
it
would
be
more
efficient
to
have
the
case
heard
just
once
would
be
to
completely
undermine
that
principle.
i'd
like
to
remain...
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
are
you
going
to
respond
to
mr.
solovy's
last
point,
that
you
never
went
back
to
the
panel?
yes.
i'll
respond
to
that
directly.
we
did
exactly
what
the
panel's
rules
require,
which
is
to
go
in
the
first
instance
to
the
district
court,
the
transferee
court,
and
ask
for
a
suggestion
of
remand.
when
the
district
court
denied
that
motion,
it
simultaneously
transferred
the
case
to
itself,
which
under
the
jpml
rules
deprived
the
panel
of
any
further
jurisdiction
over
the
case,
so
we
had
no
choice
at
that
point
but
to
seek
mandamus
in
the
ninth
circuit,
which
we
did.
respondents
of
course
at
that
point
argued
to
the
ninth
circuit
mandamus
is
inappropriate
because
they
have
a
complete
remedy
on
appeal.
the
ninth
circuit
accepted
that
argument
and
that's
why
we're
here
today.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes,
exactly,
but
we're
not
dealing
here
with
an
abuse
of
discretion
action.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
i
don't
think
you
do.
first
of
all,
we're
asking
you
to
vindicate
the
mandate
of
1407
in
the
first
instance,
which
is
absolutely
clear,
and
says
the
case
shall
be
remanded.
second,
even
under
1404
we're
not
talking
about
a
discretionary
balancing
of
factors.
we're
talking
about
a
direct
violation
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
you
had
mentioned
the
polite
fiction
that
somehow
the
arizona
court
stands
in
the
shoes
of
the
illinois
court,
but
it's
really
a
distortion
of
the
statutory
language
to
say
that
the
court
is
both
the
self
and
the
other
within
the
scope
of
that
single
sentence,
and
there's
no
reason
to
distort
that
language
in
order
to
reach
a
result
that
congress
clearly
did
not
intend--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--well,
then
we
would
not
rely
on
1404,
but
our
position
would
be
exactly
the
same
under
1407.
their
position
has
rendered
the
language,
shall
be
remanded,
into
a
nullity.
it
has
also
turned
the
unless
previously
translated
language
into
utter
surplusage.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
the
first
instance,
but
we
also
in
our
cert
position
said
can
he
transfer
it
to
himself,
and
that's
an
independent
violation
which
we
were
allowed
to,
and
did,
raise.
now,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
issue
of
remedy,
justice
o'connor,
because
i
think
it's
quite
critical.
there
are
potential
cases
in
which
it's
going
to
be
difficult
for
the
transferee
court
to
decide
when
pretrial
proceedings
have
or
have
not
ended,
and
the
jpml's
rules,
that's
why
they
require
you
to
go
to
him
in
the
first
instance,
because
he's
the
one
who's
going
to
know.
but
this
case
is
an
easy
one,
because
there's
no
dispute
that
any
prospect
of
coordinated
and
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings
had
ended
at
that
point,
so
the
case
had
to
be
remanded
as
of
the
date
that
lexecon
made
its
motion,
because
that
is
the
triggering
event.
venue,
unlike
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
can
be
waived,
but
where
it's
not
waived
the
statute
is
absolutely
clear,
and
that's
the
relevant
cut-off
date.
