we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-1482,
lexicon,
inc.
v.
milberg,
weiss,
bershad,
hynes
&
lerach.
mr.
kellogg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there
is
a
line
you
omitted,
is
there...
it
doesn't
say
by
the...
from
the
district
to
which
it
was
transferred,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
authority
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
illinois.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kellogg,
do
you
agree
that
under
the
rule,
14(b),
what
the
district
court
did
here
was
proper?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say,
though,
the
rule
is
unauthorized.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
district
court
is...
does
not
have
total
freedom
in
its
options
even
under
the
rule,
but
it
can
assign
it
to
itself,
i
guess,
because
it's
not
the
transferee
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
under
the
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
your
opponent
say
other...
when
they're
referring
to
other
district
courts
the
base
of
reference
is
the
northern
district
of
illinois.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why...
i
don't
know
that
i
quite
follow
that.
why
is
a
judge
who
doesn't
transfer
necessarily
less
worthy
than
a
judge
who
does
transfer?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
supposing,
mr.
kellogg,
that
the
arizona
district
court
had
remanded,
as
you
say
it
had
to,
to
the
district
of...
then
could
the
district
of
illinois
have
granted
a
motion
for
change
of
venue
to
the
district
of
arizona?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
it
might
not
have
been
brought
there,
or
just
as
a
matter
of
discretion
that
the
district
court
in
illinois
wouldn't
have
done
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you...
is
your
position
that
you
must
show
that
sort
of
prejudice,
or
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--a
venue
error
is
always
reversible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
rule
couldn't
change
the
statutes
governing
appealability
anyway,
could
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
kellogg.
mr.
solovy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
the
olberding
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
it
could
have...
perhaps
it
could
have
been
brought
in
arizona,
but
several
of
our
cases
talk
about
the
plaintiff's
choice
of
forum.
the
plaintiffs
did
not
choose
to
bring
it
in
arizona.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
your
answer
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
means
ended.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ended
temporarily?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
else
is
a
case
ended,
other
than
temporally?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i
wonder
how
much
that
plumbing
fixtures
case
should
influence
us.
if
you
take
a
cognate
situation,
we
give
great
weight
to
things
that
were
enacted
by
the
first
congress,
the
judiciary
act
of
1789,
because
members
of
that
congress
sat
in
the
constitutional
convention,
but
it's
not
as
if
these
judges
sat
in
congress
at
the
time
congress
enacted
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
telling
me
that
judge
becker
was
in
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
quite
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
held
in
what
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
continental
grain?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
your
view
that
improper
venue
could
never
prejudice
the
petitioner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
solovy.
mr.
kellogg,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kellogg.
the
case
is
submitted.
