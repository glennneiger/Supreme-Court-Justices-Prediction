justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
those
were
cases
of
wrong
venue,
mr.
kellogg,
were
they
not?
this
is
a
case...
the
district
of
arizona,
as
i
understand
it,
is
a
place
where
personal
jurisdiction
existed
as
to
all
defendants,
and
it
was
a
place
of
proper
venue.
olberding
involved
a
wrong
venue.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
go
back
over
your
initial
answer
to
justice
o'connor
about
summary
judgment.
do
i
understand
you
right
to
say,
not
in
this
case
but
as
a
general
matter,
summary
judgment
is
a
pretrial
thing,
so
it
could
be
had,
where
i
think
your
position
is
that
the
multidistrict
forum
has
no
authority
ever
to
grant
140...
to
deal
with
1404(a),
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
summary
judgment
sometimes,
1404(a)
never.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kellogg,
i
think
you
answered
in
response
to
my
question
earlier
that
1404(a)
is
not
available
at
all
to
this
multidistrict
forum,
not
to
itself
and
not
to
another
forum.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
to
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
but
your
position
is
the
district
of
arizona
could
not
have
transferred
it
to
california
any
more
than
it
could
have
transferred
it
to
itself.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
14...
and
to
what
extent
are
you
relying
on...
you
said
1404(a)
came
in
in
the
forties,
and
this
is
much
later
legislation.
1404(a)
when
it
came
in
envisioned
only
a
transferor
that
would
ship
out,
so
are
you
saying
that
because
that
was
the
world
at
the
time
1404
came
in,
that
is
to
allow
a
forum
to
send
something
out,
that
it
can't
be
applied
in
tandem
with--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
by
the
transferor
forum,
and
you
quickly
went
by
gulf
oil,
but
1404(a)
wasn't
rejecting
that
decision.
it
was
saying
the
terrible
consequence
that
the
forum
would
dismiss
and
then
you'd
be
caught
up
on
the
statute
of
limitations,
so
congress
provided
for
transfer
to
another
district.
but
it
envisioned
the
transferor,
which
in
this
case
would
be
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
or
plaintiff's
choice,
that
forum
deciding
to
send
it
some
place
else,
so
i
think
you
have
to
stay
a
little
longer
with
what
1404(a)
was
meant
to
do.
it
was
definitely
a
shipping
out
provision
when
congress
enacted
it,
not
a
shipping...
not
a
retention.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
forum
was
the
transferor
forum?
we
have...
the
transferee
forum
ends
up
being
the
district
court
in
arizona,
but
who
is
the
transferor?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
1404
transfer,
the
self
transfer,
do
we
have
a
transferor
and
a
transferee?
or
do
we
have
only
a
transferee?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
before
you
get
off
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
you're
relying
on
the
northern
district
of
illinois
as
the
starting
place,
that
is
the
transferor,
and
now
we're
in
the
district
of
arizona
under
the
multidistrict
panel
order.
if
the
district
of
alabama
is
at
that
moment
asking
the--
--arizona.
--for
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
the
only
transferor
in
the
picture,
mustn't
it
do,
in...
consistent
with
van
dusen
v.
barrett
say,
we're
going
to
make
this
decision
as
though
we
were
the
northern
district
of
illinois,
because
that's
the
only
transferor
that
congress
has
given
power
in
this
setting.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
solovy,
in...
the
kal
case
involved
a
question
of
what
was
the
substance
of
the
federal
law,
what
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
governed.
this
is
a
question
of
an
exercise
of
discretion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
quite
different
in
that
regard.
there
is
only
one
federal
law,
but
in
exercises
of
discretion,
reasonable
minds
can
differ.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
were...
mr.
kellogg
told
us
likely
the
northern
district
of
illinois
would
have
kept
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
solovy,
the
main
problem
that
i
have
with
using
the
motion
to
transfer
as
a
lever
to
get
trial
under
a
statute,
1407,
that
has
pretrial
written
all
over
it,
the
multidistrict
panel
transfers
it
to
a
district
for
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings.
1407(b)
begins
such
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings.
pretrial,
pretrial
is
all
over
this,
and
then
you're
saying,
ah,
but
transfer
is
a
pretrial
motion.
therefore,
we
can
use
it
as
a
lever
to
have
a
trial
under
a
statute
that
had
in
mind
pretrial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
are
you--
--i'm
sorry,
i
wasn't
following
you.
--how
does
a
court
decision
8
months
later
convey
congress'
understanding?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
congress
passed
words
in
a
statute,
not...
the
murrah
committee
didn't
pass
anything,
and
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
troubling
me
about
this,
as
bright
an
idea,
and
as
efficient
as
it
is,
isn't
it
the
kind
of
thing
that
the
judges,
if
they
want
it,
should
tell
congress
this
is
it,
transfer
for
trial
includes
trial,
rather
than
go
about
it
in
this
rather
complicated
way?
