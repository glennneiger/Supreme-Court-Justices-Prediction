justice

is
this
issue
comprised
within
the
question
that
we
granted
certiorari?
couldn't
we
just
remand
to
the
district
court
if
we
agree
with...
to
the
court
of
appeals
if
we
agree
with
you
on
this
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
it
crucial
to
deciding
whether
we
have
a
case
or
controversy?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
not
much
of
a
policy
if
the
district
court
can
assign
all
of
the
cases
to
a
second
district
court.
if
the
district
courts
in
the
country
thought
it
was
very,
very
important
for
them
to
continue
business
almost
as
usual
they
could
assign
it
to
the
second
best
district
court--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
so
we'd
have
the
second
best
district
courts
trying
these
cases
all
over
the
country.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view
of
the
case,
termination
occurs
when
the
district
judge
makes
the
order
transferring
the
case
to
itself?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if
that's
the
first
order
that
it
makes,
everything
after
that
is
not
a
pretrial
order?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
then
you
give
no
effect
to
the
statutory
language
at
or
before
the
conclusion
of
the
pretrial
proceeding.
you
say
the
pretrial
proceedings
are
concluded
the
second
the
district
court
gets
the
case
if
that's
its
first
order.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
1406(b),
which
you...
1406,
subsection
(b)
that
you
cited
to
us,
it
says,
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
impair
the
jurisdiction
of
a
district
court
of
any
matter
involving
a
party
who
does
not
interpose
timely
and
sufficient
objection
to
venue.
that
indicates
to
me
a
statutory
command
that
improper
venue
can
be
jurisdictional
just
as
the
petitioners
say
it
is
in
this
case.
