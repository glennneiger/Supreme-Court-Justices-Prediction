justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--now,
mr.
kellogg,
under
your
theory
when
should
this...
your
suit
have
been
remanded?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
was
that
when
the
lincoln
savings
litigation
ended,
when
the
consolidated
proceedings
ended,
after
summary
judgment
was
entered,
when?
i
don't
know--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
under
your
theory--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
what
had
happened
at
that
time?
i
mean,
which
of
these
events
had
already
occurred?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
no
determination
had
been
made
on
summary
judgment
in
your
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
maybe--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--maybe
the
district
court,
pursuant
to
that
original
transfer,
could
go
ahead
and
decide
that,
could
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
when
the
consolidated
proceedings
had
ended
you
say
it
had
to
go
back.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
in
fact,
it
did
not,
and
a
jury
trial
was
held,
and
it
was...
the
jury
determined
that
against
your
client.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
at
that
point,
what's
the
remedy?
why
shouldn't
we
just
leave
things
be?
even
if
you
read
it
right,
why
should
we
upset
that
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
kellogg,
i
want
to
bring
you
back
to
the
possible
remedy,
because
even
if
i
were
to
agree
with
you
on
your
reading
of
the
statutes,
i'm
not
sure
that
you're
entitled
to
have
the
jury
verdict
set
aside
now.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
caterpillar
points
the
other
way.
there
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
there,
and
the
court
admitted
as
much,
but
said
we're
not
going
to
upset
this
verdict.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
solovy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i'd
like
to
look
at
how
well
it's
worked,
too.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
i
think
we
have
to
also
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
and
i
don't
think
it
supports
your
position
very
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
does
say
it's
supposed
to
be
transferred
back
to
the
original
court
for
trial.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
you
take
the
position
that
the
transfer
is
a
termination.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
a
termination.
