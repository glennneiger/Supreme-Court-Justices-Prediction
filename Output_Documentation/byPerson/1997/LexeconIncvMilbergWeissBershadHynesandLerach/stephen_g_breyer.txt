justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i...
to
go
back
to
remedy
for
a
minute,
am
i
right
that
there
is
no
authority...
i
couldn't
find
any.
i
don't
see
any
in
the
briefs,
but
you
might
tell
me
there
is
some,
in
which
case...
on
the
following
two
related
questions.
question
1,
a
district
court
makes
a
mistake
about
venue
and
holds
the
trial.
is
that
harmless,
or
isn't
it?
there's
just
no
authority.
caterpillar
had
to
do
with
jurisdiction.
the
second
related
question
is,
let's
assume
that
harmless
error
applies.
a
court
of
appeals
makes
a
mistake
about
mandamus.
it
says
you
have
an
adequate
remedy,
but
you
don't
because
of
harmless
error.
then,
given
that
fact,
should,
later
on,
you
get
an
appeal,
whereas
otherwise
you
wouldn't?
on
those
two
questions...
i
would
assume
the
answer
to
the
second
is
no,
you're
just
out
of
luck,
but
maybe
i'm
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
assume
that
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is,
i
don't
know.
in
other
words,
those
seem
to
be
the
two
cases
where
i
look
for
authority,
the
two
key
matters
on
your
harmless
error
point.
i
couldn't
find
any
authority.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
one
do
you
think
is
the
best,
closest
one?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
one
do
you
want
me
to
specially
look
at?
[laughter]
i'll
look
at
them
all,
but
which
one
do
you
think
is
right
on
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
not?
i
mean,
he's
had...
they've
had
a
complete
trial.
they
had--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--nobody
says
it's
unfair
trial.
there's
certainly
jurisdiction.
it
just
happened
to
be
at
a
place
that
the
statutes
don't
provide
venue,
venue
after
all
being
a
matter
of
convenience
for
the
parties,
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
fairness
of
the
proceeding,
it's...
or
jurisdiction
or
something.
so
the
reason
why
it's
important
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i
know,
but
what
were...
the
reason
why
that's
such
an
important
defect
that,
even
though
there
was
a
totally
fair
trial,
et
cetera,
nonetheless
we
should
do
this
all
over
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
are
many
trial
errors,
aren't
there,
where
judges...
the
only
way
to
review
them
is
through
mandamus,
or
you
lose
them.
this
would
be
one
of
those,
presumably.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
a
close
question
the
judge
certifies
it.
if
it's
not,
you'd
have
to
rely
on
mandamus.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on...
my...
the
question
for
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for
me.
i'm
not
speaking
for
anyone
else,
is
i
thought
the
question
that
was
bothering
me
is
where
does
the
district
court
get
the
legal
power
to
transfer
a
case
to
himself
for
trial?
it
doesn't
seem
to
come
out
of
1407
for
the
reason...
in
addition
to
what
you
say
to
me
it's
very
important...
that
the
judicial
conference
drafted
the
bill
and
wrote
to
conference,
wrote
to
congress,
right
in
the
report
the
letter
from
the
judges,
at
or
before
the
completion
of
the
pretrial
proceedings
the
panel
would
remand
each
case
to
the
district
from
which
it
has
originally
come.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
hasn't
finished.
and
then
they
have
attached
a
little
report
from
the
coordinating
committee
of
judges
who
said
the
major
innovation
proposed
is
transferred
solely
for
pretrial
purposes.
now,
if
the
judges
say
that
to
congress
and
the
language
supports
it,
don't
they
have
to
stick
to
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
part...
the
other
place
where
you
try
to
get
your
authority
from
is
1404(a)
in
the
absence
of
1407.
well,
in
the
absence
of
1407
i
become
concerned
about
the
language,
which
does
say,
other
court...
it
says
a
district
court
may
transfer
a
civil
action
to
any
other
district,
and
i
don't
know
how
that
language
in
the
absence
of
1407
can
be
avoided,
and
i
don't
see
how
1407,
given
its
language,
purposes,
and
representations
by
the
judges
to
congress,
can
help.
that's
the
problem
i'm
having
with
the
merits
of
your
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
took
it
that
your
argument
was
basically
something
like
this,
that
the...
an
illinois
judge
under
1404(a)
could
always
transfer
to
arizona.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
1407
does
is,
it
says
for
purposes
of
the
pretrial
proceedings,
arizona
judge,
you
stand
in
the
shoes
of
the
illinois
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
since
you're
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
illinois
judge
you
are
in
effect
the
transfer
court.
therefore,
transfer
it
to
yourself.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
what
i
was
looking
for
in
support
for
that
argument
is,
is
there
something
in
the
history,
or
is
there
something
in
the
law
that
says...
because
it's
a
kind
of
fiction
in
an
effort
to
squeeze
what's
practical
into
the
language
of
1404.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
is
there
something
that
supports
that
kind
of
fiction
in
the
legislative
history
or
elsewhere
that
would
be
helpful
to
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
can
i
ask
you
one
other
quick
question?
you...
did
i
hear
you
correctly
that
you
thought
olberding
and
schnell,
the
cases
involving
the
harmless
error,
involved
venue?
this
does
not
involve
venue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
this
case
jurisdiction
and
venue
are
proper
in
either
court.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
this,
on
that
particular
point:
what's
worrying
me
about...
venue
and
jurisdiction
are
proper
in
both
places,
not
proper,
but
they
lie
in
both
places,
so
we're
really
asking
the
question
of
whether
a
1404
error,
a
1404(a)
error
is
reviewable
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
a
trial.
if
you're
right
on
that,
and
it
is
reviewable
after
trial,
does
that
mean
there'd
always
be
the
argument
after
a
fair
trial
this
was
not
a
jurisdiction
where
it
was
convenient
for
the
witnesses?
this
was
not
a
jurisdiction...
there
was
abuse
of
discretion
on
that,
and
therefore
we
will
have
review
in
the
courts
of
appeals
and
set
aside
trials
because
of
a
1404(a)
violation
on
the
ground,
abuse
of
discretion
in
respect
to.
do
you
see
what's
bothering
me?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
if
you
win,
don't
we
also
have
to
say
that
the
trial
doesn't
cure
an
abuse
of
discretion
in
a
transfer
in
respect
to
convenience
of
witnesses?
