what
are
those
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
what
are
the
appropriate
circumstances?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
mean
if
every
single
case
involves
the
same
summary
judgment
motion?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
consolidated
means
that
which
is
common
to
all,
rather
than
referring
to
simply
a
collection
of
cases
which
are
consolidated
for
whatever
pretrial
proceedings
there
might
be
involving
common
issues?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i'm
sure
there
are
many
multidistrict
litigation
instances
where
the
trial
court
said,
now,
there's
three
different
kinds
of
cases.
we're
going
to
have
discovery...
three
different
subclasses
of
cases.
we're
going
to
have
discovery
of
one
sort
in
one,
another
in
another.
i
don't
see
that
there
has
to
be
a
determination
of
commonality
before
you
can
make
that
ruling.
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
it
correct
that
the...
i
don't
have
it
in
front
of
me,
but
there's
a
specific
provision
for
review
by
extraordinary
writ
on
this
venue
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
any
order
of
the
panel.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we
cannot
say,
then,
on
that
basis
that
this
is
necessarily
made
in
effect
a
final
order
for
purposes
of
interlocutory
appeal,
because
certainly
the
statute
would
not
be
construed
that
broadly.
not
every
issue
that
the
panel
makes
would
be--
justice
david
h.
souter
--presumably
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
a
final
order.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you
don't
claim
it's
a
final
order,
do
you?
i
take
it
you
claim
that
it
would
be
reviewable
only
if
it
in
fact,
it
is
certified,
is
that
right--
justice
david
h.
souter
--reviewable
on
an
interlocutory
basis,
that's
your
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you
had
gotten
your
certification
and
it
had
been
reviewed
on
the
merits
on
an
interlocutory
basis
and
you
had
lost,
you
then
at
the
conclusion
of
the
case,
i
presume,
would
not
claim
that
you
had
a
right
to
a
second
crack
at
review
on
that
issue,
would
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
have
one,
but
i
want
to
hear
your
answer
to
him
first.
justice
david
h.
souter
transfer
by
whom?
by
whom?
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
the
tough
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
nothing
either
in
the
report
that
you
were
reading
or
in
the
text
of
the
statute
that
affirmatively
supports
that
position.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
all
he's
got
to
do,
if
that
is
his
conclusion,
is
follow
1407
prior
to
the
conclusion
of
his
consolidated
pretrial
proceedings,
transfer
it
back
to
the
original
transferor
judge,
and
say,
these
people
want
to
transfer
to
some
other
district.
i
think
it
makes
sense.
i
don't
have
the
authority
to
do
it.
you
do.
that's
the
way
out
of
that
conundrum.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
the
way
out
of
what
justice
clark
referred
to
as
the
limbo,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that
can
be
done,
can't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
excuse
me.
it
can
be
done,
can't
it?
