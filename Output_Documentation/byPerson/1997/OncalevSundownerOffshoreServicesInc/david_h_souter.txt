no,
but
you
don't
concede
as
a
matter
of
law,
do
you,
that
the
bisexual
harasser
cannot
harass
on
the
basis
of
sex?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
a
person
may
be
quite
neutral
on
sexuality
and
still
in
fact
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
sex,
and
you're
not
conceding
that
fact.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
your
point
here
that
when
the
hazing
is
of
the
sexual
nature
here,
simply
by
proving
what
went
on,
you
make
a
stronger
prima
facie
case
that
in
fact
there
was
sex
discrimination
going
on
than
you
would
be
if
you
were
merely
to
prove
hazing
of
a
totally
nonsexual
nature?
isn't
that
the
real
difference?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
theoretically
your
burden
is
the
same.
in
this
case,
your
burden
is
to
prove
that
in
fact
these...
the
individual
defendants
here
would
not
have
treated
women
the
same
way
they
were
treating
this
man.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that
the
employer
would
not
have
reacted
or
have
condoned
this
sort
of
treatment
in
a
women...
had
women
been
the
object
of
it,
whereas
they
have
condoned
it
in
this
case.
those
are
your
two
burdens,
then.
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
right.
then
what?
even
if
it's
not,
wouldn't
you
also
say,
even
if
it's
not
sex-specific,
even
if
it
doesn't
get
beyond
the
point
of
calling
the
person
a
jerk,
if
the
employer
calls
males
he
doesn't
like
jerks,
and
does
not
do
the
same
thing
for
females
he
doesn't
like,
that
would
qualify
under
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
and
is
the
reason...
is
the
reason
it
is
not
implicated
simply
because
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
implicate
it?
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
it's
the...
the
text
covers
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
was
not
the
problem
that
congress
was
addressing.
is
that
your
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
why
does
the
text
cover
white
against
white
discrimination?
the
language
is
equally
undifferentiated.
justice
david
h.
souter
well
then,
why
doesn't
the
statute
cover
reverse
sexual
discrimination
when
it
happens
to
take
a
sexually
explicit
form?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
so
far
as
the
text
of
the
statute
is
concerned,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
draw
a
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
sure,
but
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
exactly
the
same
argument
could
have
been
made
about
discrimination
because
of
race.
you're
talking
about
somebody
of
race
a
who
treats
race
b
in
a
disadvantageous
way,
and
exactly
that
same
argument,
if
it
were
sound,
would
have
led
to
the
conclusion
that
you
can't
have
discrimination
by
one
white
against
another
white.
justice
david
h.
souter
why
have
you
changed
it
when--
justice
david
h.
souter
--why
have
you
not
changed
it
when
you
say
because
of
race?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
it--
--well,
are
you...
may
i...
are
you
saying
that
it's
simply
the
nature
of
the
harassment
rather
than
the
nature
of
the
discrimination
against
a
member
of
one
sex
or
the
other
which
is
the
crucial
thing,
so
that
it
comes
down
to
a
point
almost
of
evidence?
