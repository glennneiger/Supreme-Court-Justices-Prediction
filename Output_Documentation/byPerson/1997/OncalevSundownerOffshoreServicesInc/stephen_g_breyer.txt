g.
breyer
why
is
that?
because
if
a
jew
could
discriminate
against
a
jew,
an
african
american
against
an
african
american,
an
italian
against
an
italian,
all
those
things
could
happen.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
isn't
it
possible
that
a
homosexual
or
nonhomosexual
man,
irrespective,
could
discriminate
against
another
man
on
the
basis
of
sex,
and
so
could
a
woman?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
well,
if
that's
so,
if
those
things
are
possible--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--as
they
think
they
are,
how
could
you
have
a
circuit
that
has
a
rule
that
says
they're
not
possible
under
the
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
that
must
be
wrong,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
isn't
it
the...
that
they're
trying
to
get
at
the
problem
of
whether
the
employer
has
imposed
a
term
or
condition,
a
significant
term
or
condition
because
of
the
person's
gender,
and
in
those
instances
where,
for
example,
people
create
a
workplace
where
there
is
either
quid
pro
quo
or
some
frightful
situation
where
the
women
have
to
suffer
because
of
their
gender,
they
have
a
term
or
condition
that
the
others
don't,
and
the
same
could
happen
to
a
man,
couldn't
it?
i
grant
you
it's
hard
to
work
out
in
the...
in
some
individual
cases.
in
many
it's
not
hard
to
work
out.
but
how
does
that
differentiate
this
from
any
other
area
of
law,
antitrust,
or,
you
know,
thinking
of
difficult
ones,
and
how
could
you
escape
that
in
this
statute?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
it's
not
necessary
to
look
at
it
as
an
expansion
of
the
statute.
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
sufficient
to
look
at
the
sexual
harassment
law
as
being
in
effect
a
kind
of
evidentiary
gloss
on
the
statute,
that
when
this
kind
of
conduct
occurs,
as
thoreau
put
it,
you
know,
there's
a
trout
in
the
milk.
we
know
what
that
means,
and
i
don't
see
why
we
don't
also
draw
an
inference
when
the
harassment
is
between
the
same
sexes.
it
may
in
some
instances
be
more
difficult
to
draw
it,
but
as
justice
scalia
says,
what
is
the
theoretical
basis
for
saying
you
can
never
draw
that
kind
of
an
inference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
why
we
can
draw
the
inference
so
easily,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
a
practical,
common
sense
thing,
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
more
difficult
to
draw.
i
can
understand
your
point
there,
but
how
do
you
take
the
final
leap,
you
can't
draw
it?
