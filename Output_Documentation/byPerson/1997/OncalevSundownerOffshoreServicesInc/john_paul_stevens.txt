so
it's
a
presumption?
justice
souter
used
the
kinder,
gentler
word
of
prima
facie
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
reasoner,
can
i
ask
you
sort
of
a
basic
question?
your
opponent
relied
on
the
manhart
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
i
guess
the
basic
test
is,
if
this
person
would
have
been
treated
differently
if
he
had
been
of
the
opposite
sex,
then
that's
a
prima
facie
proof
of
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
agree
that
if
the
jury
could
reasonably
infer
from
the
set
of
circumstances
that
the
same
thing
would
not
have
happened
if
this
person
had
been
a
woman,
that
then
that
would
be
the
necessary
showing
of
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
that's
how
you
answered
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
supposing
we
disagree
with
that.
we're
not
bound
by
what
they
said.
supposing
we
say,
this
is
just
a
discrimination
statute.
then
why
doesn't
it
apply
in
the
hypo
i
give
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
the
evidence
were
clear
that
the...
that
if
a
woman
had
been
on
the
barge,
that
he
would
not
have
done
this
because
he
had
a
special
interest
in
relationships
with
men,
if
that
was
clearly
proved--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--would
that...
why
would
that
not
be
discrimination
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
the
manhart
test
the
answer
to
all
this?
you
say
there
are
all
sorts
of
problems,
but
why
don't
you
just
have
a
very
simple
rule?
if
the
plaintiff
sustains
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
victim
would
have
been
treated
differently
if
he
or
she
had
been
of
the
opposite
sex,
that
proves
discrimination.
why
isn't
that
a
simple
test
that
works?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
require
the
proof
in
the
particular
case
and
make
the
plaintiff
prove
his
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
jury
finds
here,
well,
we're
pretty
well
convinced
that
this
fellow
would
have
done
the
same
thing
to
women,
the
plaintiff
loses.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
reasonable
inference
is
he
wouldn't
have,
the
plaintiff
wins.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we'd
just
be
following
what
we
wrote
in
manhart,
you
know,
15
or
20
years
ago.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
there's
another
way
of
looking
at
it.
instead
of
saying
it's
expanding
the
statute,
say
the
statute's
always
covered
discrimination,
and
you're
asking
to
cut
out
of
the
general
field
of
discrimination
this
one
area.
one
can
look
at
it
that
way,
too.
