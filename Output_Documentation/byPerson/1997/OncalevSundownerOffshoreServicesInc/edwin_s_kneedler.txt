mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
test
under
title
vii
is
whether
a
person
was
treated
in
the
way
he
or
she
was
because
of
that
employee's
sex.
as
this
court
said
in
vinson,
to
quote,
without
question,
when
a
supervisor
sexually
harasses
a
subordinate
because
of
the
subordinate's
sex,
that
supervisor
discriminates
on
the
basis
of
sex,
or,
put
another
way,
as
in
manhart,
when
the
person
is
treated
in
a
manner
different
from
what
he
would
have
been
treated
if
gender
had
not
been
taken
into
account.
the
question
of
how
someone
of
the
opposite
sex
is
treated
is
one
way
of
proving
that
ultimate
question,
but
the
court
in
vinson
regarded
it
as
treating
someone
because
of
their
sex
as
discrimination.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that...
there's
a
difference
between
motive
and
treatment.
i
mean,
if
we
look
at
harris,
for
example,
in
harris
the
harassment
was
explicitly
sexual,
sex-based.
the
employer
was
saying,
you
dumb
woman,
comments
like
that.
it
was
facially
sex-based,
just
like
in
johnson
controls
the
policy
with
respect
to
employment
was
explicitly
sex-based,
and
the
court
said
when
you
have
something
that's
explicitly
sex-based
the
motive
behind
that
does
not
detract
from
the
fact
that
it
is
a
violation
of
title
vii.
and
when
you...
in
the
opposite
gender
harassment
cases
the
courts,
lower
courts
have
been
prepared
to
assume,
as
i
think
this
court's
descriptions
in
vinson
and
harris
have,
that
it
is
because
of
sex.
now,
that
may--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
think
that
the
courts
have
assumed
that
it's
because
of
sex,
that
there's
something
relational
about
sex.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the...
what
i
was
saying,
though,
is
that
it
prohibits
action
because
of
sex.
it
was
intended
to
remove
race,
sex,
national
origin
from
the
decision-making
process.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
because
of
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--because
of
the
sex
of
the
victim.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
may
well
be
that
in
that
situation
the
conduct
is
not
because
of
the
recipient's...
of
the
victim's
sex.
that
is
the
requirement,
and
as
the
court
said
in
harris,
this
is
a
question
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
and
the
severity--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
textually...
this
is
a
constructive
discharge
case,
among
other
things,
and
the
statute
says
it's
an
unlawful
employment
practice
to
fail
or
refuse
to
hire...
excuse
me,
or
to
discharge
an
individual
or
otherwise
discriminate
because
of
the
individual's
sex.
the
suggestion
textually,
discharge
because
of
sex,
is
taken
to
be
discrimination
in
that
situation,
and
this
is
consistent
with
the
purpose
of
title
vii,
which
is
to
render
irrelevant
a
person's
sex,
just
as
the
person's
race
or
national
origin
is
to
be
irrelevant
in
the
workplace.
so
if
you
have...
in
the
hypothetical
equal
opportunity
harasser,
if
someone
uses
explicitly
sex-based
harassing
terms,
rising
to
the
level
of
offensiveness
at
issue
in
harris,
against
women
using
sex-specific
words
and
men
using
derogatory,
sex-specific
terms,
each
of
those
employees
experiences
the
terms
and
conditions
of
his
or
her
employment--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
each...
going
back
to
manhart,
the
question
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
the
words
used,
discriminate
means
treat
differently,
or
a
draw
a
distinction
between,
and
the
words
chosen
for
the
harassment
of
the
woman
are
different
from
the
words
chosen
of
the
harassment
of
the
man,
and
specifically
because
of
the
recipient's--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--and
it
is
not...
it
is
not...
perhaps
looked
at
in
other
ways,
it's
not
facially
sex-based.
in
the
opposite
sex
sexual
harassment
cases
the
courts
have
been
prepared
to
assume,
i
think,
that
it
is
because
of
sex.
maybe
that's
an
assumption
about
human
behavior,
and
probably
an
accurate
one.
it
is
seldom
the
case
that
the
victim,
or
the
other
person's
sex
is
irrelevant
in
sexual
conduct.
sex
is
relational.
it's
done
with
regard
to
the
sex
of
the
other
person,
whether
it's
the
same
sex
or
opposite
sex.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it's
not--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
wouldn't
be
okay...
if
you
have
very
abusive
conduct
that
is
not
sex-based
on
its
face,
it
would
still
be
open
to
the
employee
to
show
that
it
is
because
of
the
employee's
sex
by
showing
that
women
were
not
treated
in
the
same
way.
but
where
it
is
explicitly
sex-based,
where
it
is
by
use
of
the
sex
organs,
it
would
at
least
be
a
permissible
inference
for
a
finder
of
fact
to
conclude
that
this
conduct
would
not
have
been
engaged
in
with
a
woman,
that
this
was
done--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
i
think
again--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
would
depend
on
the
facts
and
circumstances.
if
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
charge
would
be
that
it
has
to
be
because
of
sex,
and
i
would
think
ordinarily
that
would
be...
the
jury
could
draw
an
inference...
i
think
it
should
go
to
the
jury,
but
it's
a
question--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
if
the
method
that
was
done
was
sex-specific...
for
example,
the
grabbing
of
the
genitals--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--right.
no,
absolutely.
no,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
otherwise.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
think
the
question
is,
was
he
treated
in
a
manner
but
for
the
fact
that
he
was
a
man
he
would
have
been
treated
differently,
and
the
fact
that
it
was
sexual
conduct
is
a
permissible
basis
upon
which
a
trier
of
fact
can
conclude
that
that
was
so.
i
mean,
this
conduct
may
have
been--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
might
be,
but
i
just
want
to
make
clear,
for
example,
in--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that
if
something
is...
if
the
method...
it's
not
just
the
identity
of
the
person.
if
the
manner
of
the
treatment
is
selected
because
of
the
sex
of
the
person,
in
this
case
placing
the
penis
on
the
person's
head
because
it
was...
it
would
be
regarded
as
especially
humiliating
for
a
man
to
be
subjected
to
that
treatment,
then
the
manner
of
treatment
as
well
as
the
selection
of
the
individual,
if
that
is
because
of
sex,
then
there
is
a
violation
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
as
in
price
waterhouse,
the
question
of
how
a
woman
would
have
been
treated,
or
a
man,
in
that
case,
may
be
evidence
that
goes
to
whether
the
person...
whether
sex
was
made
relevant
in
the
action,
but
the
ultimate
question
is
whether
something
that
shouldn't
have
been
relevant
was
made
relevant
in
that--
