mr.
kneedler,
will
you
please
get
into
this
question
of
what
a
plaintiff
has
to
show
when
it's
a
same-sex
situation,
in
the
government's
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
an
element
of
discrimination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
how
can
that
be
shown?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
because
of
the
sex
of
the
victim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay.
so
suppose
you
have
an
employer
who
has
the
unfortunate
habit
of
patting
every
single
employee,
male
or
female,
on
the
fanny
every
day,
indiscriminately,
both
sexes.
now,
how
do
you
show
sexual
harassment
under
that
discrimination
requirement
of
title
vii?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
you're
leaving
out
the
word
discriminate,
which
is
in
the
statute.
you're
just
looking
at
the
part
of
the
statute
that
says,
because
of.
now,
don't
you
have
to
at
least
instruct
on...
that
a
discrimination
because
of
the
individual's
sex--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
think
that's
what
they
held,
i
guess
we'd
have
to
say
that's
wrong.
[laughter]
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
mr.
reasoner--
--and
it
sure
reads
that
way,
so
i
think
you
have
to
come
to
grips
with
that
and
then
help
us--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--decide
what
it
is
this
statute
really
means.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
that
context,
do
we
consider
at
all
the
eeoc
guideline
on
this?
now,
the
guideline
says
that
harassment
on
the
basis
of
sex
is
a
violation
of
title
vii
if
it's
physical
conduct
of
a
sexual
nature
when
such
conduct
has
the
purpose
or
effect
of
unreasonably
interfering
with
an
individual's
work
performance
or
creating
an
intimidating,
hostile,
or
offensive
working
environment.
the
guideline
does
not
refer
at
all
to
discrimination,
i
notice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
read
you
the
eeoc
guideline--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--on
sexual
harassment,
or
harassment,
however
you
pronounce
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
does
that...
do
we
rely
on
that?
are
they
entitled
to
some
deference
there--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
how
we
interpret
this
statute?
