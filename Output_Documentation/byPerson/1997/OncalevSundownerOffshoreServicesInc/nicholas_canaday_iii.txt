mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
rejecting
joseph
oncale's
title
vii
claims,
the
fifth
circuit
stated,
same-sex
harassment
claims
are
not
cognizable
under
title
vii.
the
question
presented
through
this
appeal
is
whether
the
fifth
circuit's
categorical
rejection
of
same-sex
claims
under
title
vii
is
correct.
we
argue
that
it
is
not.
the
court
below
should
be
reversed.
same-sex
sexual
harassment
claims
are
actionable
under
title
vii.
this
case
is
not
about
the
outer
limits
or
parameters
of
same-sex
sexual
harassment
as
an
actionable
form
of
discrimination
because
of
sex,
nor
is
this
case
about
the
methods
of
proof
of
such
a
claim.
this
case
is
about
whether
a
same-sex
sexual
harassment
claim
exists
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
fifth
circuit
rule
that
same-sex
claims
do
not
exist
under
title
vii
is
not
sex-specific.
it
is
an
absolute
rule.
both
sides
to
this
litigation
agree
that
women
are
entitled
to
the
protections
of
title
vii,
but
to
accept
the
fifth
circuit
rule
is
to
accept
the
proposition
that
a
woman's
right
to
work
in
an
environment
free
of
unwelcome
sexual
conduct,
or
sexual
solicitation,
turns
on
the
sex
of
her
harasser.
if
the
harasser
is
a
female,
the
woman
has
no
rights
or
remedies
under
title
vii
as
interpreted
by
the
fifth
circuit.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
it
does,
your
honor.
this
case
does
involve
a
man,
but
i
emphasize
that
the
fifth
circuit's
ruling
is
not
a
male-on-male
decision,
it
is
a
same-sex
decision,
and
i
emphasize
that
to
point
out
the
breadth
of
the
fifth
circuit's
categorical
and
absolute
rule
that
same-gender
sexual
harassment
claims,
regardless
of
the
genders,
as
long
as
they're
identical,
and
regardless
of
the
underlying
facts,
would,
under
the
fifth
circuit's
rule,
be
dismissed
as
a
matter
of
law,
but
your
honor,
you're
exactly
correct,
this
is
a
male-on-male
situation,
but
the
court
did
not
decide
the
case
on
that
fact
except
to
recognize
that
the
genders
of
the
two
parties,
the
harasser
and
the
victim,
were
the
same.
so
to
accept
the
fifth
circuit's
rule,
then,
is
to
agree
that
the
sex
of
the
harasser
defines
the
scope
of
title
vii.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
your
honor,
the
fifth
circuit
has
ruled
categorically
that
if
there
is
a
male
victim
and
a
male
perpetrator
they
do
not
look
at
the
underlying
facts
or
circumstances
of
the
harassment.
they
decided
as
a
matter
of
law
that
same-gender
causes
of
actions
do
not
exist.
the
fifth
circuit's
rule
would
be
equally
applicable
were
this
a
woman-on-woman
case.
the
fact
that
it
is
male-on-male--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--that
is
correct,
there
was
no
other
sex
involved,
but
that
factual
determination
is
not
the
foundation
of
the
fifth
circuit's
rule.
the
fifth
circuit's
rule
is
a
categorical
rule.
the
fifth
circuit
in
fact
did
not
discern
or
consider
the
underlying
circumstances
or
the
maleness
of
the
workplace.
the
fifth
circuit's
rule
is
the
broadest
of
possible
brushes.
it's
an
absolute
rule.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
your
honor,
that's
exactly
correct,
because
my
case
was
thrown
out
as
a
matter
of
law.
the
court
below
found
that
no
facts
were
material.
the
court
below
did
not
review
the
facts
and
determine
which
facts
of
the
alleged
harassing
situation
were
material.
they
didn't
decide
this
case
as
a
matter
of
fact.
they
decided
this
case
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
we
would
prevail
if
the
jury
was
instructed
that
sexual
harassment
is
a
cognizable
form
of
discrimination
based
on
sex.
the
jury
could
then
be
instructed
on
the
law
as
established
in
the
circuits
and
as
articulated
by
this
court,
and
then
the
court,
the
trier
of
fact
could
draw
the
reasonable
inference...
well,
first
of
all,
under
the
facts
alleged
the
trier
of
fact
could
determine
that
joseph
oncale
was
quid
pro...
the
victim
of
quid
pro
quo
sexual
harassment,
or
the
trier
of
fact,
under
the
facts
as
they
currently
stand,
could
find
that
joseph
oncale
was
victimized
of
a
hostile
sexual
environment.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
your
honor,
we
would
have
to
show
that
discrimination
because
of
sex,
as
defined
by
this
court
in
the
meritor
case,
did
in
fact
occur,
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
well,
on
the
facts--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--if
it
is
the
off-color,
or
the
poor
joke
case,
your
honor,
i
believe
the
argument
then
would
be,
or
the
issue
then
would
be
whether
or
not
the
severity
or
pervasiveness
of
the
conduct
raised
the
level--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--yes,
sir.
if
the
facts
were
that
the...
all
employees
of
both
genders
are
treated
equally,
the
equal
opportunity
harasser...
first
of
all,
let
me
emphasize
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
but
assume
hypothetically
it
was,
then
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
that
under
the
facts
you
could...
the
jury
could
discern
an
attempt
to
discriminate
based
on
sex.
so--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--no.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
no,
sir.
that
is
not
our
position
in
this
case.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
no,
sir.
if
i
stated
that,
i
misspoke.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
in
the
pure...
in
the
true
bisexual
harasser
scenario,
which
again
this
case
is
not,
the
court
could
then
look
at
the
sexual
nature
of
the
conduct
and
could,
under
existing
precedent,
argue
that
each
victim
was
a
victim
of
sexual
harassment.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
but
the
individual
claimant,
your
honor,
who
brought
the
cause
of
action
alleging
that
he
or
she
was
the
victim
of
sexual
discrimination
could
demonstrate
that
their
work
environment
was
a
discriminatorily
hostile
work
environment
and
then,
perhaps
as
a
matter
of
defense--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--then
that
would
be--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--but
that
would
be
a
matter
of
affirmative
defense,
would
it
not,
not
as
matter
of
an
element
of
cause
of
action.
if
that
person
shows
that
they
are
singled
out
for
mistreatment
based
upon
sex--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--yes.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
right,
and
again,
if
that
was--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--well,
i
do
not
believe
it
transfers
over
to
the
case
that
i
have
because
the
case
before
you
now
is
the
first-step
case
as
to
whether
the
cause
of
action
exists
and
secondly,
in
my
case,
only
men
were
harassed
under
the
situation
on
the
sundowner
rig.
only
joseph
oncale
was
harassed.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
that
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
absolutely
not,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
your
honor.
i
do
not
concede
that.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
taking
the
position
that
any
harassment--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--well,
i
believe
that
the
exclusions
would
be
a
matter
of
fact,
whether
or
not
it...
whether
or
not
the
harassment
was
shown
as
a
matter
of
fact
to
raise
to
the
level
of
severity
of
the--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--if...
assuming
the
harassment
does
raise
to
the
level
of
severity
and
pervasiveness
and
would
be
recognized
as
sexual
harassment,
then
our
position
is
that
the
gender
of
the
harasser
vis-a-vis
the
gender
of
the
victim
is
not
a
material
fact.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
i
believe
that's
an
essential
element
of
the
cause
of
action,
but
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case
said
that
those
circumstances
could
never
be
proved
in
a
same-gender
sexual
harassment
claim.
these
questions
that
the
court
have
posed
are
questions
of
proof,
or
questions
of
motive,
but
not
of
questions
of
definition.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
your
honor,
there
is
discrimination
because
joseph
oncale
in
this
case,
alone
among
men
in
a
workplace,
was
selected
by
his
supervisor,
a
male,
to
be
the
victim
of
that
male
supervisor's
unsolicited,
unwanted,
and
obnoxious
sexual
advances.
that
is
sexual
harassment.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
but
removing
the
element
of
sex,
then--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--then
he
would
not
have...
i
don't
believe,
under
that
fact
pattern,
he
would
have
a
right
of
action
under
title
vii.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
well,
if--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--well,
i
believe
that
what
we've
argued
in
brief
is
that
it
is...
the
singling
out
for
sex-specific
or
sex-driven
conduct
is
one
category,
this
category,
but
your
hypothetical--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--right.
to
answer
your
question,
though,
you
asked
earlier,
your
honor,
is
if
the
conduct
was
devoid
of
sexual
connotations,
or
didn't
involve
grabbing
mr.
oncale's
genitalia,
or
didn't
involve
use
of
a
bar
of
soap
in
a
shower,
as
this
case
did,
then
perhaps
there
would
have
to
be
showing
of
modus,
or
motive,
or
intent,
or
animus,
independent
of
the
facts.
but
given
that
this
man
was
singled
out
for
sexual
abuse
by
his
supervisors,
the
component
of
sexuality
as
a
component
of...
because
of
his
sex
is
inherent
in
the
fact
pattern.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
yes,
sir.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
i
believe
if
the
harassing
conduct
is
nonsexual
then
the
plaintiff
would
have
a
burden
of
establishing
a
disparity
of
treatment
and
show
that
perhaps
that
supervisor
didn't
treat
women
the
same
way
so
as
to
show
the
motive
to--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--you
have
to
show
that
this
individual
was
harassed
or
discriminated
against
because
of
his
sex.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
that
is
true.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
yes,
your
honor,
in--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--right,
and
the
manner
in
which
members
of
the
opposite
gender
are
treated
and
the
manner
in
which
the
employer
may
respond
to--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--your
honor,
it
may
well
be
relevant,
but
we
do
not
concede
that
it's
determinative.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
we
might
be
able
to
show
how
women
were
treated
in
other
circumstances,
in
other
work
offices
of
sundowner,
or
how
they
responded
to
sexual
harassments
by
other
individuals.
we
may
be
able
to
demonstrate
that
mr.
lyons
may
confess
that
had
joseph
oncale
not
been
a
man
he
never
would
have
done
that.
in
the
current
posture
of
this
case
we
haven't
had
an
opportunity
to
take
mr.
lyons'
deposition,
but
those
are
the
types
of
questions
we
would
certainly
explore
with
him.
i'd
like
to
save
some
time
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
same-sex
harassment
is
not
cognizable
under
title
vii.
that
is
the
holding
of
the
court
below.
again,
we
re-urge
the
court
to
reverse
that
holding.
the
language
of
title
vii
is
broad
enough
to...
that
a
decision
of
the
court
below
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
interpretations
of
the
statute--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--yes,
your
honor,
and
this
court--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--sexual
discrimination.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
yes,
sir,
as
set
forth
in
the
meritor
case.
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
i--
mr.
nicholas
canaday,
iii
--no,
sir.
i
said
that
the--
[laughter]
our
position
is
that
the
sexual
nature
of
the
conduct
does
allow
for
the
inference
which
has
been
recognized
in
the
cross-gender
cases
of
the
fact
that
it
is
because
of
sex,
but
our
position
is
that
it
is
inherently
a
question
of
fact
which
needs
to
move
to
the
trier
of
fact.
it
is
not
a...
we
are
not
asking
for
a
per
se
rule.
we're
asking
for
a
rule
that
recognizes
the
factual
nature
of
the
inquiry,
and
with
that,
we
thank
the
court
for
its
attention
in
our
case.
