not
necessarily.
i
mean,
you
could
say
if
the
harasser,
whoever
he
or
she
is,
treats
members
of
one
sex,
whether
the
same
sex
as
the
harasser
or
the
opposite
sex,
differently,
you
could...
so
you...
if
you
have
a
difference
of...
in
treatment
by
the
perpetrator
of
males
and
females,
that's
one
thing.
so
i
don't
think
that
the
fifth
circuit
has
ruled
quite
as
broadly
as
you
suggest.
you
could
have
a
male
perpetrator
and
a
male
victim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
my
point
is,
this
was
an
all-male
environment,
too,
and
wasn't
that...
don't
we
have
to
take
the
decision
in
that
context?
in
other
words,
they
didn't
say
that
if
you
have
an
employer
who
treats
members
of
one
sex
one
way
and
members
of
another
sex
another
way
there
would
still
be
no
claim
under
title
vii
if
the
victim
is
a
male
and
the
perpetrator
is
a
male.
they
didn't
say
that.
there
was
no
other
sex
involved
in
this
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
any
harassment,
provided
that
it's
grave,
fits
under
title
vii,
then?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
would
you
exclude?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
let's
assume
that
it's
very
gross,
but...
so...
and
it
meets
all
the
standards
of
our
case
law
about
it
has
to
be
pervasive
and
grave.
is
there
any
category
that
you
would
then
omit,
or
are
you
saying
that
all
sexual
harassment,
provided
it
meets
the
standards
of
being
severe
and
pervasive,
fits
under
title
vii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
could
you
show
that
for
an
all-male
workforce?
that's...
you
seem
to
be
thinking
that
it's
irrelevant
that
we
don't
have
any
comparison
group,
and
yet
you
answered
justice
souter,
yes,
it
is
relevant.
where
you
have
an
all-male
workforce,
how
can
we
know
how
the...
this...
these
gross
people
would
have
treated
women,
or
how
the
employer
would
have
reacted
to
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
would
you
prove
anything
at
all
about
it,
because
what
evidence
would
you
have
about
how
women
would
have
been
treated
had
they
been
in
the
workplace?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
would
it
be
wrong
for
the
judge
to
charge,
you
make
a
decision.
was
it
because
of
his
sex?
did
they
want
to
demean
him
because
they
didn't
consider
him
sufficiently
male,
or
was
it
just
that
they
didn't
like
him
and
they
used
this
disgusting
way
of
showing
it?
would
that
be
a
proper
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
under--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you--
--you
could
rely
on
the
chief
justice.
he
wrote
it.
[laughter]
mr.
reasoner,
have
you
finished
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor?
i
have
a
question,
but
i...
if
you
have
more
to
say--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
you
could...
is
it
in
general?
if
you
have
a
male
boss
who
takes
good
care
of
the
women
but
treats
the
men
miserably,
that
would
not
be...
that
would
not
be
in
title
vii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
would
it
be
different?
let's
say
you
had
two
rooms
in
the
same,
and
in
one
there
were
women
working,
in
the
other,
men,
and
when
the
women
complain
about
sexual
harassment,
the
boss
attends
to
it,
takes
it
seriously,
and
when
the
men
complain
about
the
grossest
treatment,
the
kind
we
have
here,
the
boss
says,
boys
will
be
boys.
that
would
be
okay?
that
would
not
be
within
title
vii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i'm
talking
only
about
title
vii,
so...
but
i've
given
you
a
situation
where
the
employer
responds
to
women's
complaints
of
sexual
harassment,
says
to
the
guys,
you've
got
to
be
made
of
sterner
stuff,
so
i'm
not
going
to
pay
any
attention.
that
would
not
come
within
title
vii?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
same
boss
treats
women
one
way,
he
attends
to
their
complaints,
and
he
treats
men
a
different
way,
says,
i'm
not
going
to
listen
to
you.
i've
no
sympathy
with
you.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
our
choice
is
not
between
nothing
and
everything,
so...
and
your
argument
is
for
nothing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
any
part
of
this
case?
as
far
as
i
know,
it
isn't,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
see,
we
don't
know
that
at
this
stage.
the
case
has
been
thrown
out
because
it
says
no
matter
what,
if
it's
male-male,
it's
not
covered.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
couldn't
it
be
because
you're
not
the
right
kind
of
man,
just
as
with
respect
to
women,
and
wasn't
there,
at
least
in
one
case,
a
statement
to
the
effect
of
what
title
vii
is
aimed
at
is
getting
rid
of
stereotypical
notions
about
the
way
men
are
or
the
way
women
are,
so
that
if
you...
we
know
that
an
employer
can't
say,
as
in
martin
marietta,
how
could
i
discriminate
against
women,
most
of
the
people
i
hire
are
women,
but
i
won't
take
the
ones
who
have
children.
so
if
that's
what
title
vii
is
about,
you're
not
the
right
kind
of
male,
or
you're
not
the
right
kind
of
female,
why
wouldn't
it
fit?
