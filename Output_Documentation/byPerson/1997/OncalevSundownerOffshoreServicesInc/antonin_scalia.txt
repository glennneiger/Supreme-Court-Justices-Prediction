justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
saying
that
the
other
sexual
harasser,
or
the
homosexual
harasser
is
liable,
but
the
bisexual
harasser
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
there
is
immunity
for
the
bisexual
harasser.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
each
victim
would
have
been
a
victim
of...
would
have
been
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
that
person's
sexuality,
but
not
on
the
basis
of
that
person's
sex,
because
it
was
indifferent
to
the
harasser
whether
the
person
was
male
or
female.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
more
so
than
people
of
the
other
sex.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
the
person
has
to
show.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
if
they
show
they're
singled
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
point
is,
they
haven't
been
singled
out.
this
person
treats
males
and
females
alike.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
wonder...
you
know,
if
you
acknowledge
that
the
bisexual
harasser
does
not
violate
this
law,
i
just
wonder
how
that
transfers
over
to
the
case
that
you
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
really
call
them
sexual
advances.
it
was
certainly
not...
a
lot
cruder
than
that,
but
suppose...
suppose
that
mr.
oncale
had
been
hazed,
which
is
what
the
other
side
says.
this
is
just,
you
know,
good
frolics,
and
male
hazing.
suppose
he
had
been
hazed
in
some
other
fashion.
i
mean,
just
as
obnoxious,
but
just
not...
you
know,
nothing
to
do
with
genitals
or
anything
else.
they
just
said,
you
know,
you're
a
fat
slob.
your
eyes
are
crooked.
and,
you
know,
they
just
made
life
miserable.
the
same,
but...
just
as
obnoxious.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
just
using
something
else,
other
than
his
manhood,
as
the
basis
for
the
hazing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
see,
i
find
that
difficult
to
understand.
i
mean,
that...
he's
still
singling
out
this
person.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
why
singling
him
out
on
the
basis
of
his
sexuality
means
that
you're
singling
him
out
on
the
basis
of
his
sex.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
is
this
a
law...
i
mean,
is
this
a
dirty-word
law,
or
something?
it
wasn't
meant
to
produce
politeness
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
that
possibly
be
involved
in
this
case?
i
mean,
there
were
other
men
in
the
workplace
who
weren't
treated
this
way.
they
just
didn't
like
this
guy.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
difficult
to
see
that
there
ought
to
be
a
distinction,
with
regard
to
the
application
of
this
law,
whether
the
particular
individual
who
was
harassed
in
this
case
is
made
to
feel
small
and
insignificant
and
embarrassed
by
using
dirty
sex
words
or
in
some
other
fashion.
i
can't
see
how
that
would
have
anything
to
do
with
whether
he's
being
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
his
sex.
you're
telling
me
if
you
call
him
a
jerk
every
day,
that's
okay,
but
if
you
use
some
sex-related
word
it's
not
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
mandatory...
would
it
be
a
mandatory
conclusion?
does
it
go
to
the
jury?
you
know,
if...
do
you
tell
the
jury,
if
you
find
that
the
reason
they
were
giving
this
man
a
hard
time,
including
through
sexual
acts
and
so
forth,
is
because
of
his
sex,
you
will
find
for
the
plaintiff.
however,
if
you
think
they
were
doing
this
just
because
for
some
reason
they
didn't
like
this
guy--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
just
want
to
know
what
the
charge
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
instruction
that
i
just
gave...
if
you
think
the
reason
they
did
these
sex-based
acts
is
because
they
didn't
like
his
sex,
that's
one
thing,
if
you
think
they
did
it
just
because
they
didn't
like
this
jerk,
that's
something
else--
justice
antonin
scalia
sure.
i...
that's
no
question.
i'm
talking
about
this
case,
an
all-male
workforce,
and
they
have
picked
on
this
fellow,
and
they've
picked
on
him
in
ways
that
have
sexual
connotations.
what
charge
do
you
give
to
the
jury?
is
it
enough
that
they've
picked
on
him
in
ways
that
have
sexual
connotations?
if
you
find
that
they
did
this,
there
has
been
sexual
discrimination.
is
that
the
charge?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
do
you
tell
the
jury,
in
addition
to
finding
that
they
did
this,
you
have
to
find
that
they
did
it
because
they
didn't
like
his
maleness,
and
it...
this
was
not
just
some
other
way
of
hazing
him.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
they
get
no
chevron
deference,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what's
the
basis
for
that
understanding?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
reasoner--
--well,
mr.
reasoner...
go
ahead.
let
me
see
if
i
understand
what
your
position
is.
suppose
that
there
had
been
hazing
of
male
employees
without
any
sexual
allusions
or
connotations,
and
you
have
a
workplace
in
which
only
male
employees
are
hazed,
they
are
made
to
feel
insignificant,
or,
you
know,
horseplay,
whatever,
but
no
sexual
connotations,
and
this
is
never
done
to
women
employees,
what
is
your
position
on
whether
that
would
violate
the
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
not.
well
then,
i
don't
understand
your
position.
[laughter]
you
told
me
that
you
thought
the
male-on-male
was
no
good,
only
as
it
relates
to
sexual
harassment,
and
you
said
that's
what
the
position
of
the
court
of
appeals
here
was.
i
give
you
a
case
that
doesn't
involve
any
sexual
harassment--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
was
the
case
i
gave
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is
what
i
thought
it
should
be,
right,
that
that
would
be
a
violation.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
if
you
haze
them
with
no
sexual
allusions
and
you
don't
haze
women,
then
it
is
a
violation
of
title
vii,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
then...
now
suppose
you
haze
them
with
sexual
allusions,
but
you
don't
haze
women.
suddenly
it
does
not
become
a
violation
of
title
vii?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
discriminatory
hazing
is
discriminatory
hazing,
whether
the
hazing
has
sexual
allusions
mixed
into
it
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
your
answer
would
have
to
be,
yes,
if
it's
discriminatory
hazing,
it's
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
why
do
we
have
to
go
as
far
as
you
go?
as...
i
understand
your
position.
you're
not
saying
that
male-on-male
is
bad.
there
can
be
discrimination
male-on-male.
you're
just
saying
that
sexual
harassment
male-on-male
does
not
automatically
constitute
discrimination
under
the
act,
as
male-on-female
or
female-on-male
would.
is
that
right?
does
not
automatically.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
just
because
it
does
not
automatically,
i
don't
know
why
that
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
it
does
not
ever,
and
why
was
a
summary
judgment
proper
here?
why
shouldn't
it
have
been
left
to
the
jury
to
say,
well,
regardless
of
whether
there
were
sexual
overtones
or
not,
that
doesn't
decide
the
case,
but
nonetheless,
if
you
think
that
this
individual
male
was
being
discriminated
against
because
he
was
a
man
and
not
for
some
other
reason,
you
can
find
for
the
plaintiff?
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
you've
acknowledged
that
it
didn't
intend
to
limit
it
between
men
and
women.
you've
acknowledged
that
if
you...
that
if
a
woman
discriminates
against
another
woman
because
of
her
womanness,
say,
i
just
want
a
male
workforce,
i'm
not
going
to
promote
any
women,
you've
acknowledged
that
that's
a
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
only
in
the
sexual
harassment
area--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
think
that
it
does
not
automatically
constitute
a
violation,
but
why
do
you
have
to
say
it
does
not
ever
constitute
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
statute
doesn't
make
unlawful
same-sex
harassment,
or
any
harassment.
it
makes
unlawful
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
don't
want
us
to
say
that
same-sex
harassment
is
actionable.
it
isn't
necessarily
actionable.
it's
actionable
if
it
constitutes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
and
only
if
it
constitutes
sexual
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
you
say
it
always
does.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
opponent
says
it
never
does.
