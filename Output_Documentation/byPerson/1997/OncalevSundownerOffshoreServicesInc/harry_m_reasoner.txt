mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
would
like
to
rest
our
argument
on
three
points,
to
the
extent
that
the
court
would
permit.
first,
i
think
the
question
by
mr.
chief
justice
about
the
relationship
of
sexual
harassment
to
this
discrimination
statute
is
at
the
heart
of
the
case.
this
is
a
discrimination
statute.
it
was
passed
in
1964,
clearly,
we
submit
by
its
plain
language
to
deal
with
discrimination
between
men
and
women.
in
our
language,
words
take
their
meaning
from
the
context,
and
in
the
context
of
this
statute
it
did
refer
to
discrimination
between
men
and
women.
sexual
harassment,
although
both
the
government
and
petitioner
treat
it
as
if
it
were
an
independent,
statutory
concept
not
tied
to
the
fundamental
finding
of
discrimination,
is
not
an
independent--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
and
if
i
might
attempt
to
explain,
i
think
that
when
you...
that
the
court
extended
the
statute
to
say
that
sexual
harassment
can
so
affect
the
conditions
of
employment
that
it
violates
the
statute,
creates
discrimination.
that
is
clearly
powerfully
true
with
regard
to
women.
congress
was
well-informed
on
that.
they
had
passed
in
1963
the
equal
pay
act,
and
so
to
extend
the
statute
to
say
if
you
are
harassing
women
in
the
workplace
you
are
creating
a
discrimination
which
deprives
them
of
a
level
playing
field.
we
do
not...
and
i
think
that
this
extension
is
reasonable.
the
question
that
is
now
being
asked,
the
court
is
now
being
asked
to
do
is
say,
you
have
extended
sexual
harassment
into
the
area
of
men
and
women,
discrimination
between
men
and
women.
now
we
want
you
to
extend
it
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
men.
sexual--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--it
says
because
of
sex,
your
honor,
correct,
and
i
would
interpret
that
to
mean
the
two
sexes,
men
and
women.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
what
i
would--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i
think
i
did,
too.
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
at
least,
is
this.
if
we
move
into
federal
regulation
the
whole
spectrum
of
male
relationships
which
are
sexually,
which
have
sexual
content
and
are
abusive
and
in
the
workplace...
and
i
submit
to
you,
that
is
what
both
the
petitioner
and
the
government
are
asking
for.
if
you
look
at
page
21
of
the
government's
paper,
in
response
to
justice
o'connor
and
justice
ginsburg's
question,
they
would
include
it
all,
all
male
conduct
that
has
a
sexual
content
that
is
in
the
workplace
and
is
abusive.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
if
mr.
oncale
would
have
been
treated
differently
if
he
had
been
a
woman?
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
your
honor--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--let
me
suggest
to
you
why
i
think
that
the
statute
should
not
be
applied
in
that
way,
and
three
circuits
have
followed
that
notion.
the
fourth
circuit,
sixth
circuit,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
have
adopted
the
concept
of
a
homosexual...
if
the
homosexual...
there's
a
homosexual
harassment,
then
they
can
meet
the
because-of-sex
requirement.
you
would
argue
that
if
you
can
find
homosexuality,
or
raise
an
issue
of
homosexuality,
then
it
was
because
of
mr.
oncale's
sex
that
this
occurred.
i--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i...
with
respect,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
is
an
overstatement
of
the
fifth
circuit's
position,
as
i
would
understand
it.
i
think
you
must
bear
in
mind
that
the
fifth
circuit
was
speaking
only
to
sexual
harassment,
and
only
to
the
question
that
when
the
court
has
extended
this
discrimination
statute
into
the
area
of
sexual
harassment
to
meet
its
purposes,
should
it
then
extend
it
further
to
regulate
same-sex
conduct?
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
think,
your
honor,
what...
mr.
chief
justice,
what
i
understood
you
to
say
in
meritor
is
that
sexual
harassment
can
be
equivalent
to
discrimination
if
it
is
so
severe
and
pervasive
that
it
changes
the
conditions
of
employment,
thereby
discriminating
against
the
sex
being
harassed.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
well,
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
agree
with
that,
and
both
in
meritor
and
harris
you
were
dealing
with
sexual
harassment
of
women,
very
clear
based
on
congressional
findings...
i
mean,
that
there
was
a
disparity.
there's
a
disparity
in
power.
there
was
a
need
to
level--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
court
can
look
to
the
equal
pay
act
of
1963,
that
there
were
extensive
findings
by
congress
that
there
was
a
disparate
treatment
of
women
in
the
workplace.
my
point
on
federalism
is
that
there
are
no
findings,
anywhere,
that
suggest
that
congress
needs
to
pass
a
statute
to
regulate
discrimination
among
males,
or
to
regulate
male
conduct.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
certainly,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
well,
i
think...
you're
using
the
word
discriminate.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
there's--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i
don't
think
it
does,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
fifth--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
well--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--no,
and
the
eeoc
flatly
argues,
your
honor,
if
you
look
at
their
brief
they
want
to
include
it
all.
they
feel
no
obligation
to
prove
discrimination.
but
again,
all
the
fifth
circuit
was
addressing
was
sexual
harassment,
and
i
respectfully
submit,
as
the
circuits
which
struggled
with
this--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
yes.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i
think
they're
entitled
to
deference
only
insofar
as
the
court
finds
them
consistent,
and
they're
not
entitled
to
a
chevron-type
deference,
as
this
court
has
made
clear,
only
insofar
as
you
find
them
consistent
and
persuasive.
but
i
would
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
the
question
here--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--that
is
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
if
i
might...
i
don't
recall
your
case.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
thank
you,
mr.
justice
stevens.
i
will
rely
on
mr.
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
if
i
could
say
this
one
word,
or
sentence,
the
fifth
circuit
is
saying
that
discrimination
because
of
sex
was
not
intended
to
comprehend
relationships
between
the
same
sex.
it
was
not
intended
to
comprehend
all
the
whole
spectrum
of
males'
treatment
of
males.
because
of
sex
meant
discrimination
between
men
and
women.
that's
why
they
would
exclude
sexual
harassment.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
there
is
a
clear
distinction
between
policies
regarding
to
pay,
promotion,
et
cetera.
that's
clear.
you
can't
discriminate.
the
sex
of
the
superior
deciding
that
is
immaterial.
it
is
only
the
area
of
sexual
harassment,
this
interpersonal
abuse--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--no,
it
would
not
be
okay.
the
conduct
alleged
here,
for
example,
would
violate
five
louisiana
criminal
statutes,
and
subject
all
the
participants
to
damages.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
no,
your
honor,
i
think
not,
in
the
sense
if
what
is
being
complained
about
is
male
harassment
of
a
male.
the...
now,
to
the
extent--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--let
me
say,
clearly,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
such
a
boss
would
be
foolish,
and
would
be
inviting
action
under
state--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--but
the
question
here
is,
did
congress
in
1964,
when
it
said
discrimination
because
of
sex
intend
to
encompass
not
only
discrimination
between
men
and
women
based
on
sex,
but
the
entire
gambit
of
sexuality...
and
that
is
what
the
government
would
argue
for.
as
mr.
justice
scalia
said,
we
would
now
be
into
sexuality,
for
example--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--my...
i
do
not
believe,
your
honor,
that
if
you
cross
this
threshold,
certainly
you
have
no
assistance
from
the
petitioner
or
the
government
in
drawing
a
line,
and
if
you
look
at
how
the
circuits
have
tried
to
struggle
with
this,
in
doe
the
seventh
circuit
said
we
will...
in
trying
to
say
what
because
of
sex
means,
they
looked
at
sexual
stereotyping,
sexual
orientation,
sexuality
in
general.
they
then
attempted
to
retreat
from
that
in
johnson
v.
hondo
shortly
thereafter
saying,
well,
we
won't
look
at
sexual
content
alone,
but
once
you
get
into
regulating
male
behavior
with
sexual
content--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--because
it's
not
simple,
your
honor,
because
how
do
you
give
content
to
it?
the
fourth,
sixth,
and
eleventh--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--well,
what
is--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i
would--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
the
creation
of
a
statute
that
was
not
intended
by
congress.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
mean,
there
in
manhart
you're
talking
about
treating
men
and
women
differently--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--on
levels
of
policy,
pension
plans,
pregnancy
leave,
et
cetera.
now,
when
we're
talking
about
interpersonal
relationships
and
we're
going
to
attach
them
to
discrimination
in
some
way,
what's
the
content
we
give
to
them?
what
does
because
of
sex
mean?
the
only
thing
the
fourth,
sixth,
and
eleventh
circuit
could
figure
out
that
because
of
sex
meant
was
that
we
inquire
into
the
sexual
orientation
of
the
predator.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i...
your
honor,
i
think
that
you
would
go
where
congress
did
not
intend.
i
think
when
they
said
discrimination
because
of
sex,
it's
very
clear
that
they
were
trying
to
level
the
playing
field
between
men
and
women,
and
that
there's
no
evidence,
not
the
slightest
evidence
that
they
intended
to
federalize
the
regulation
between
men
and
men.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
would
say
it
would
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
apologize,
mr.
scalia.
i
did
not
realize
you...
that
was
the
case
you
were
giving
me.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
think--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--well--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--yes.
i
clearly...
if
a
company
set
a
discriminatory
policy,
that
would
be
a
different...
discriminating
between
men
and
women,
that
would
clearly
be
reached
by
the
statute.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
if
the
company
sets
a
discriminatory
policy.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
think
what
a
court
must
then
ask
itself,
your
honor,
is
what
does
because
of
sex
mean,
and
i
submit
to
you...
congress
has
not
passed,
as
you
know,
the
employment
nondiscrimination
act,
which
i
think
tries
to
deal
in
a
way
that
would
be
workable
and
not
intrusive
and
violative
of
privacy,
with
harassment
based
on
sexuality
or
orientation.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
but
that--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--if
the
defendant
is
going
to
be
allowed
to
raise
the
issue
as
to
whether
it
is
because
of
sex,
mr.
justice
scalia,
then
i
think
you
are
opening
it
up
into
inquiry
as
to
the
sexual
orientation
of
all
of
the
parties
involved.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
the...
i...
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
be
inclined
to
say
not,
but
you...
i
think
i
just
heard
the
petitioner
say
that
they
would
argue
that
there
was
quid
pro
quo
possibility
involved.
they
will,
and
if
you're
going
to
argue
quid
pro
quo,
of
course
you
have
to--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--you
know
that
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
assert
that
over
these
facts,
and,
of
course,
this
is
a
fee-shifting
statute.
you
would
make
the
federal
courts
the
forum
of
choice
for
all
litigation
involving
abusive
male-on-male--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
when
one
looks
at
the
struggles
of
the
seventh
circuit,
the
fourth,
the
sixth,
and
the
eleventh,
to
work
out
a
rationale
to
make
this
statute...
and
i
submit
one
reason
it
is
so
difficult
to
work
out
is
because
this
statute
was
never
designed
to
regulate
conduct
among
the
same
sex,
then
i
think
that
the...
that
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
courts
desperately
need
guidance.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
if
she
discriminates
in
an
employment
decision,
a
promotion
decision,
certainly
not.
you
know,
discrimination
at
the
level
of
company
policy
or
supervision
is
certainly
not
immune.
if
she
discriminates...
if
she
propositions
her,
or
makes
sexual
overtures
to
her,
then
yes,
we
would
say
that
that
is
not
implicated
by
the
statute.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
think
that
the
text
does
not
cover
it.
i
think
that--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--well,
the
statute
would
cover
reverse
discrimination.
it
would...
i
mean,
in
all
its
aspects,
but--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--well,
i
would
submit
that
you're
having
to
change
the
meaning.
if
you
say
discrimination
because
of
sex,
speaking
of
gender,
you're
talking
about
discrimination
because
somebody's
a
male
or
because
somebody's
a
female.
that's
exactly
what
you
had
in
meritor
and
harris.
you
went
no
further
than
that.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
no,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
if
you
look
at
because
of
sex,
when
you
apply
it
to...
a
female
to
a
female,
or
a
male
to
a
male,
you
have
changed
the
meaning.
you
are
now
making
it
because
of
this--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--because--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
we're...
that
sexual
harassment
is
a
complex
concept
that
implicates
many
things
that
because
of
race
does
not.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
no.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
would
say
that
on
the
harassment
that
male-on-male,
it's
not
because
of
sex.
it
may
be
because
of
orientation,
it
may
be
because
of
sexuality,
it
may
be
because
he
doesn't
like
him--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--well,
i
think
your
honor
illustrates
the
difficulty.
martin
marietta
is
easy.
of
course
that's
discrimination.
but
are
we
now
going
to
say
that,
on
male-on-male
relationships,
that
abuse,
because
we
don't
like
their
appearance...
i
mean,
does
it
all
go
back
to
sex
and
harassment,
and
i
submit
to
you
that's
what
the
government
would
have
you
do.
they
say
to
you
flatly
it's
immaterial
what
the
motives
were,
and
the
test
is
tautological.
you
say,
because
of
sex.
man
harasses
a
man,
of
course
it's
because
of
sex.
what
else?
he
is
a
sex.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
would
certainly
agree
that
it
does
not
automatically--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--your
honor.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
it
leads
to
that
conclusion,
your
honor,
if
you
conclude
that,
looking
at
the
language
of
title
vii
in
context,
that
congress
intended
to
limit
it
to
discrimination
between
men
and
women,
that
it
did
not
intend
to
reach
into
same-sex
harassment,
and--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--certainly.
certainly.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
exactly.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
i
have
to
say
that,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--the
fifth
circuit
said
that.
[laughter]
but...
but
let
me
say,
i
do
believe
that
is
correct.
i
think
it
implicates
serious
concerns
of
federalism
to
now
say
that
this
statute
will
be
expanded
to
uncover
this
entire
spectrum
of
relationships,
and
to
do
it
with
no...
you
have
no
standard.
once
you've
cut
loose
from
the
moorings
of
the
two
sexes,
because
of
sex,
are
we
then
going
to
get
into
homosexuality--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--one
could,
your
honor,
but
i
submit,
and
even
the
government
admits
this
at
page
10
of
their
brief,
that
sexual
harassment
was
an
expansion
of
the
statute
based
on
the
intent
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
necessary
to
achieve
the
statutory
purposes,
and
the
question
before
the
court
now
is,
does
sexual
harassment
need
to
be
applied
in
the
context
of
single-sex
relationships
in
order
to
achieve
the
statutory
purposes,
and--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--well,
you
know,
first
i
would
say
that
there...
the
statute
is
solid.
it
does
not
create
such
an
offense.
second,
we
have
a
history
in
the
literature.
we
know
about
the
disparate
treatment
of
women,
et
cetera.
we
know
that
there
was
something
for
congress
to
remedy
there.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
with
regard
to
women,
correct.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
but
now,
on
same
sex,
we
have
the
whole
spectrum,
from
hazing,
bullying...
you
know,
i
mean,
would
we
argue
that
generations
of
fraternity
boys
are
liable
under--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--title
vi,
or--
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
--but
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
because
of
sex
becomes
contentless
in
this
statute
if
you're
going
to
say
every
time
there's
sexual
content,
male-on-male
abuse,
it's
sexual
harassment.
mr.
harry
m.
reasoner
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
