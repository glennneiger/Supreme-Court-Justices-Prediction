chief

we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-568,
joseph
oncale
v.
sundowner's
offshore
services,
inc.--
mr.
canaday.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
this
case
involved
a
man.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
as
i
understand,
mr.
canaday,
you're
not
asking
us
to
decide
whether
or
not
there
was
discrimination
in
this
case.
you're
simply
asking
us
to
say
that
the
fact
that
it
was
male
on
male
does
not
prevent
there
from
having
been
discrimination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
title
vii
doesn't
speak
of
sexual
harassment
or
a
hostile
sexual
environment.
that
is
a
part
of
a...
the
basic
is
discrimination.
you
would
have
to
show
that
he
was
treated
differently
because
he
was
a
man,
would
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
that
discrimination,
then?
you
would
agree
that
you
also
have
to
show
that
the
harasser
is
discriminating--
--yes--
--on
the
basis
of
sex,
which
the
statute
says,
would
you
not,
that
he
is
treating,
or
she
is
treating
one
sex
differently
from
the
other?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
take
justice
scalia's
hypothesis
that
the
hazing
here
did
not
involve
genitals,
but
just
very
nasty
treatment.
now,
if
you
could
show
the
supervisor,
or
whoever
was
the
hazer,
did
not
treat
women
the
same
way
given
the
same
circumstances,
then
i
suppose
you
could
make
out
a
claim
of
discrimination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
just
the
hazing
by
itself,
unless
you
can
show
that
men
are
treated
differently
than
women,
doesn't
make
out
a
claim.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
supposing
it
is
sexual,
you
still
have
to
show
different
treatment
of
men
versus
women,
do
you
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
to
be
discriminated
against,
that
is,
treated
differently
than
someone
of
the
other
sex.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
canaday.
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
that
out
of
the
statute,
mr.
kneedler.
it
says
discriminate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
i'm
talking
about
the
statute.
i'm
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well
then,
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical,
then,
would
not
meet
the
statute
because
no
words
were
chosen.
each
one
is
just
patted
on
the
fanny.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
reasoner,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
doesn't
say
either
women
or
men.
it
says
sex.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
there
are
only
two,
so
far
as
we
know.
[laughter]
but
you
answered
my
question
by
saying,
if
there
was
a
fair
inference
for
the
jury
to
draw
that
the
man
was
treated
differently
because
he
was
not
a
woman,
that
a
woman
would
have
been
treated
one
way
and
a
man
a
different
way,
that's
not
discrimination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
employers
can
discriminate
because
of
sex
without
the
discriminator
having
any
particular
sexual
desires
for
the
victim
of
the
discrimination.
i
mean,
under
the
fifth
circuit's
ruling
a
man
who
discriminates
against
a
man
or
a
woman
who
discriminates
against
a
woman
in
the
workplace
is
immune,
and
it
seems
to
me
that's
very
difficult
to
justify.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
know
that
we
regard
it
as
an
extension
of
the
statute
to
say
that
it
covered
sexual
harassment.
i
think
what
we
said
was
that
sexual
harassment
without
actual
resulting
in
a
discharge
or
a
demotion
was
nonetheless
actionable.
i
don't
think
we
changed
the
actors
involved.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
sexual
harassment
directed
in
a
discriminatory
way
against
a
victim,
but
certainly
we
didn't
say
that
sexual
harassment
that
was
meted
out
equally
to
everybody
is
discrimination.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
were
no
findings
at
all
in
connection
with
the
inclusion
of
sex
in
the
1964
acts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.--
--if
we
were
to
decide,
mr.
reasoner,
that
in
some
cases
discrimination
by
a
man
against
a
man
violates
the
statute,
it
seems
to
me
we
would
have
to
reverse
the
fifth
circuit
here,
because
they
said
that
just
can't
be,
and
very
likely
we
don't
have
to
work
out
the
rules
that
would
apply
to
whatever
factual
development
comes
in
this
case,
but
i
don't
see
how
we
can
possibly
sustain
the
ruling
of
the
fifth
circuit
that
it
never
could
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
a
woman
supervisor
discriminating
against
a
woman?
would
that...
is
that
immune
from
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
reasoner.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
canaday,
you
have
2
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
canaday.
the
case
is
submitted.
