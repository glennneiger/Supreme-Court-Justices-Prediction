justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
are
you
going
to
have
to
show
if
you
prevail?
what
does
a
judge
tell
the
jury?
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
may
find
for
the
plaintiff
if,
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
you
had
a
case
in
which
an
uncouth
supervisor
tells
very
offensive
and
suggestive
jokes
to
both
sexes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or,
in
your
case,
if
we
could
change
the
facts
a
little
bit,
if
almost
the
same
conduct
was
perpetrated
against
both
sexes
by
this
supervisor?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
know
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
if
not,
why
is
there
discrimination?
i
think
that's
what
we're
both
asking.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
it's
also
a
question
of
how
we're
going
to
write
the
opinion.
i
mean,
maybe
you
would
prevail
under
these
facts,
but
we
have
to
understand
the
nature
of
the
cause
of
action,
and
we're
asking
you
why
there
is
discrimination
in
some
of
these
hypotheticals
that
we
have
posed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
is
there
a
presumption
that
this
kind
of
conduct
is
discriminatory?
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
statute
requires
discrimination,
and
that's
what
we're
puzzled--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you're
concentrating
on
because
of
sex,
which
is
in
the
statute,
i
agree,
but
discriminate...
discriminate
is
also
a
word
in
the
statute,
and
you're
leaving
that
out
of
your
analysis,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.--
--well--
--then
you
defend
the
fifth
circuit's
rationale
based
on
a
nonstatutory
analysis.
you
would
have
us
hold
that
if
a
homosexual
supervisor
trades
favors
with
people
of
his
own
sex
for
advancement,
that
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
statute.
