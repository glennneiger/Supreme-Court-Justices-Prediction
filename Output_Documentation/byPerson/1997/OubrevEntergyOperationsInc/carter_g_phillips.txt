mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
seems
to
me
that
the
bulk
of
the
discussion
that's
gone
on
today
suggests
as
strongly
as
anything
that
i
could
propose
to
you
why
it
is
that
we
would
do
far
better
to
leave
the
common
law
in
place,
providing
us
with
a
set
of
guideposts
that
can
be
applied
on
a
regular
basis
and
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
and
recognize
that
section
626(f)
is
a
very
pointed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
they
do
not
pay
it...
no.
no,
no.
it's
not
the
waiver
argument.
what
we're
saying
is
that
they've
forfeited
their
rights
as
a
matter
of
common
law
by
their
failure
to
comply
with
an
independent
state
law
duty
to
tender
back
the
consideration.
it
doesn't
revive
the
waiver.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
the...
it's
not.
it
is
the
failure
to
tender
back,
and
the
failure
to
pay
the
consideration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
nothing
in
the
statute
compels
her
to
tender
it
back.
it
is
a
bedrock
principle
of
the
common
law
and
contract
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i've
lost
the
waiver
issue,
your
honor.
that's
right.
she
is
perfectly
available
to
come
forward
into
court
and
bring
her
claim.
we
do
not
fear,
and
i
don't
think
any
of
the
employers
in
these
cases
fear
having
these
age
discrimination
cases
go
forward
if
that's
what
they
want
to
do,
but
what
we
are
concerned
about,
and
what
the
common
law
protects,
is
our
right
to
say,
look,
you
have
to
put
the
money
in.
that's
the
consideration
you
have
to
pay
as
a
condition
of
coming
in.
that
is
a
wholly
independent
legal
requirement
that's
been
embedded
in
the
common
law
for
200
years.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
if
we
had
given
her
money
in
return--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
course
she'd
have
to
give
that
back.
the
point
is,
is
if
you
want
to
get--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
i
understand
the
state
common
law--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
she
had
not
signed
the
release.
no.
ultimately
we--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
but
that's
not...
no.
no,
justice
stevens.
the
heart
of
my
defense
is
that
the
common
law
recognizes
an
independent
obligation,
apart
from
whether
the
release
is
waived
or
not
waived,
that
you
must
as
a
condition
of
coming
to
court
pay
back
moneys
that
have
been
paid
to
you
as
a
part--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--you
can
construe
it
that
way,
but
that's
not
the
way
the
common
law
views
it.
common
law
imposes
it
as
an
independent--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
will
go
back
to
the
court's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
olano,
which
draws
a
clear
distinction
between
waiver,
which
is
the
knowing
and
voluntary
relinquishment
of
a
known
right
and
the
implications
of
that,
and
it's
a
narrow
concept,
and
a
forfeiture
of
your
rights
which
arises
because
you
don't
fulfill
your
independent
common
law
duties,
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
is
an
independent
common
law
duty
to
put
forward
the
consideration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
you're
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
indeed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--indeed,
we
readily
concede
that
it's
an
invalid
waiver.
it's
just
not
void.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
understand
that,
justice...
your
honor,
but
the
bottom
line
here,
the
problem
with
that
is,
is
how
far
are
you
going
to
take
statutory
language
to
do
damage
to
the
common
law,
and
basically
what
this
court--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
let's
step
back
for
a
second,
because
that
is...
there
is
no
support
anywhere,
empirical,
that
i
know
of,
that
that's
true.
i
mean,
the
principle
of
tender-back
has
been
available
for
200
years.
there's
not
a
shred
of
evidence
anywhere--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
no,
but
there
have
been
principles
by
which
one
can
void
or
declare
unenforceable
contracts
for
200
years,
and
there
has
been
a
tender-back
requirement
that
applies
to
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
that
is
my
general
understanding.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
if
it...
if--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct,
if
it's
totally
void.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
not
a
shred
of
evidence
that
congress
intended
to
declare
these
totally
void,
for
the
reasons
i
think
justice
breyer's
agrument
describes--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
it's
voidable--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
agree
with
that,
because--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
the
point
of
the
ultimate...
the
significance
in
terms
of
how
the
law
operates,
and
it's
true
in
louisiana
as
it
is
in
every
other
state,
that
is,
if...
you
know,
the
fundamental
principle
is,
you
pay
back
as
a
condition.
it
is
true
that
i...
they...
i
have
both
components
of
it,
but
the
part
that
precludes
you
from
going
forward
and
has
precluded
plaintiffs
from
going
forward
for
200
years
is
the
failure
to
tender
back
the
consideration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
fela
is
exactly
on
point
in
my
favor
on
this,
your
honor,
because
there
the
language
of
section
55
says
as
plainly
as
possible
any
contract
or
device
to
limit
the
liability
of
an
employer
is
void,
and
it
says
it
in
so
many
words.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
goes
back
to
justice
scalia's
question
about
severability.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
exactly.
congress
had
a
model
it
could
follow
in
this
context.
it
had
not
only
a
statute
that
describes
the
matter
as
void,
it
also
had
a
decision
of
this
court
that
enforced
that
statute
in
a
way
that
eliminated
the
tender-back
requirement,
and
congress
didn't
follow
that
model
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
doesn't--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--it
doesn't
say
that
either.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
it
seems
to
me
congress
knows
how
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
your
honor,
if
the
position
of
the
common
law
would
have
set
aside
the
contract
for
reasons
of
coercion
or
duress
or
fraud
or
any
of
those
other
reasons,
it's
still,
under
those
circumstances,
no
more
than
voidable,
and
so
it
would
seem--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--because
the
language
has
to
be...
i
mean,
you
can
look
at
may-not-waive
on
its
own,
but
the
truth
is,
it's
a
part
of
a
provision
that
is
designed
to
modify
a
very
discrete
element
of
the
common
law.
it
eliminates
the
requirement
and
the
burden
on
the
employee
to
come
forward
and
prove
fraud,
duress,
or
the
other
conditions
that
would
justify
setting
aside
a
release.
congress
said,
we're
not
going
to
put
employees
to
that
burden.
we
are
going
to
eliminate
that
obligation.
we're
going
to
lower
the
burden
that
otherwise
would
exist.
but
beyond
that,
congress
didn't
say,
and
in
addition
to
that
we
mean
to
eliminate
through
the
language,
waiver,
all
other
forfeitures
of
rights.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
this
one
claim
is--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
of
course
not.
i'm
not
saying...
they're
not
waiving
by
failing
to
tender
back.
that's
not
a
waiver.
that
is,
as
this
court
said
in
olano,
a
forfeiture,
just
as
she's
not
waiving
if
she
fails
to
satisfy
a
statute
of
limitations
or
other
restrictions
on
the
ability
to
go
forward.
the
fact
that
she
doesn't
do
that
doesn't
trigger
626
as
a
set
of
conditions
on
that
forfeiture,
even
though
we
might
colloquially
describe
that
as
a
waiver.
that's
not
what
congress
meant
in
626.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
context
is
very
narrow
and
specific.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
what
i
thought
the
question--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
i
was
using
void
in
the
much
more
stringent
term.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
which
is
the
one
i
think
that
the
question
invited,
was--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--of
course.
i
think
those
are
fundamental
reasons
why
you
would
not
interpret
this
language--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
you're
absolutely
right.
all
i
was
answering
was
that
as
a
matter
of
the...
there
are
common
law
rules
in
which
a
particular
finding
of
void
leaves
you
without
any
ability--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
you're
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
assume
that
that
follows
quite
naturally.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
and
frankly
i
haven't
heard
word
one
from
the
other
side
to
counter
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
that...
no,
and
i
don't
know
who
taught
you
first-year
contracts,
but
my
understanding--
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
my
understanding
of
first
year
contracts
is
that
if
you
come
forward
you
have
to
bring
back
the
entire
consideration,
and
that
is
clearly
the
law--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
would
say
voidable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
invalid,
un--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
that
is
a
rule
that
could
have
been
adopted,
but
it
is
not
the
rule
that
was
adopted--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
i
think
the
reason
is
is
because
these
are
difficult--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
tender-back
requirement
requires
you
to
tender
back
the
entirety
of
the
consideration.
if
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--for
the
severance
that
you
signed.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well...
no,
we
didn't...
no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
assumption
was
that
it
is
unenforceable.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
[laughter]
so
if
i'm
right
about
the
assumption
that
it's
voidable,
and
i
think
i
was
right
about
that,
then
the
common
law
rule...
because
voidable's
one
that
arises
all
the
time.
you
get
it
in
fraud
and
coercion,
et
cetera.
it
may
apply
to
a
part
of
the
agreement,
it
may
apply
to
all
of
the
agreement.
the
rule
of
tender-back,
as
i
understand
it,
and
again
i
may
not
have
had
the
greatest
first-year
law
professor,
either,
but
as
i
understood
the
rule
is,
you
have
to
tender
back
the
entirety
of
the
consideration.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
for
the
underlying
dispute
between
the
parties.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i
don't
think
it
is.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
seems
like
an
unjust
result,
but
as
i
understand
the
basic
hornbook
rule...
i'm
not
saying
there
couldn't
be
exceptions
that
would
exist,
but
if
you're
looking
for
the
hornbook
rule,
and
the
rule
as
it
exists
in
louisiana,
at
least
in
cases
that
don't
pose
that
question,
it's
pretty
consistently
that
you
bring
back
the
entirety
of
the
consideration,
and
let's
be--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
must
say
i'm
happy
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
and
i
don't
mean
to
press
that
rule,
and
i
ought
to
step
back,
because
it
seems
to
me
what
this
tells
us
is
you
ought
to
look
to
the
common
law,
and
you
ought
to
see
how
the
states
apply
these
principles
rather
than--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
although
that
might
be
a
suitable
vehicle
for
deciding
this
case,
but
as
it
happens
the
law
in
louisiana
is
exactly
the
federal
common
law,
law
rule,
and
so
it
doesn't
make
any
difference.
in
terms
of
the
basic
principle,
is
there
a
tender-back
rule--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--oh,
absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely
it
did,
but
the
real
question
is,
if
you--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
what
we
do
have
is
a
federal
question
to
decide
where
you
look
to
the
law,
and
my
instinctive
reaction
is
that
you
ought
to
look
to
the
principles
of
state
law
and
borrow
those
principles.
in
this
particular
case,
however,
it
makes
no
difference,
because
louisiana,
like
the
law
of
every
other...
all
50
states,
and
if
there
were
a
federal
common
law
rule
what
would
be
the
federal
common
law
rule--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes.
i
think
they
should...
well,
they're
not
the
same
in...
with
respect
to
being
able
to
waive
the
rights,
sure.
that...
the
statute
takes
care
of
that.
but
with
respect
to
the
obligation
to
come
forward
and
satisfy
the
tender-back
obligation
as
an
independent,
legal
obligation
that
the
state
common
law
and,
frankly,
federal
common
law
applies,
yes,
those
are
exactly
the
same.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
that
doesn't
answer
the
question,
though.
i
mean,
it's
a
perfectly
reasonable
answer.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
doesn't
answer
the
question
whether
you
have
an
obligation
to
tender
back
as
a
precondition--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
because
that
gives
a
meaning
to
the
word
waiver
that
is
much
broader
than
that
term
is
entitled
to
carry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
it
doesn't
mean--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but
all
that
says
is...
and
again,
i
think
it's
inappropriate
to
read
that
just
as,
may
not
waive.
i
think
you
have
to
read
it
against
the
backdrop
of
all
of
those
conditions
that
are
imposed,
because
all
of
the
conditions
that
are
imposed
in
determining
whether
a
waiver
is
voluntary
and
knowing
are
all
conditions
that
would
go
to
the
question
of
coercion,
duress,
and
all
of
the
other--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
because
what
fits
the
plain
language,
justice
stevens,
is,
in
the
ordinary
case
she
has
an
age
discrimination
claim.
she's
not
happy
with
the
release
she
signed.
she's
got
[dollars]
6,000.
it
is
her
obligation,
in
order
to
get
into
court
in
the
first
instance,
to
show
fraud,
coercion,
duress,
or
some
other
justification
for
setting
aside
the
agreement.
congress
stepped
in...
and
this
is
an
important
right.
it
seems
to
be
lost
sight
of
in
this
context.
congress
stepped
in
and
modified
that
directly,
saying,
first
of
all,
you
don't
have
to
satisfy
any
of
those
requirements
that
ordinarily
entitle
a
contract
to
be
respected.
we're
going
to
drop
the
barrier
significantly,
and
second,
we're
going
to
impose
upon
the
employer
an
ongoing
obligation
to
prove
that
this
was
knowing
and
voluntary,
a
burden
of
proof
that
otherwise
doesn't
exist.
by
doing
that...
and
if
we
don't
satisfy
those
requirements,
she
is
free
to
go
into
court
against
those
common
law
doctrines
that
would
clearly
prevent
her
from
going
into
court,
and
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--but...
and
i
understand
that,
but
then
i
go
back
to
the
court's
opinion
in
united
states
v.
texas,
where
it
says,
when
congress
sits
down
and
tries
to
modify
the
common
law,
we
do
not
presume
that
congress
means
to
undo
any
broader
than
congress
states
expressly
in
the
language
of
the
statute
itself.
therefore,
it's
perfectly
sensible
to
me
under
united
states
v.
texas
to
say
626(f)
would
get
her
into
court
if
there
are
no
other
legal
impediments
to
going
into
court,
but
it
doesn't
go
that
extra
step
and
offer
her
an
opportunity
to
avoid
a
forfeiture,
a
forfeiture
of
her
right
that
arises
as
an
independent
common
law
doctrine.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
think
the
farthest
you
can
go
with
federal
common
law
is
to
deal
with
precisely
how
you
analyze
the
precise
waiver,
because
that
comes
from
the
statute,
and
if
you
have
interstices
within
the
application
of
626(f),
it
seems
to
me
those
you
would
clearly
fill
in
by
reference
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
it
seemed
clearly
to
be
crafting
a
principle
of
federal
law,
and
i'm
not
sure
the
approach
the
court
followed
there
would
necessarily
be
the
course
they
would
follow
here.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
obviously,
as
between
having
an
opportunity
to
get
some
money
back
at
the
end
of
the
day
or
not,
undoubtedly
my
client
would
prefer
that
alternative,
but
the
truth
is,
what
we
seek
to
have
vindicated
here
is
the
common
law
rule,
recognized
in
all
50
states
and
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law,
that
you
must
come
forward
with
the
consideration
at
the
outset
of
the
litigation.
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
we're
talking--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--if
we're
talking
about
no
tender
back
requirement?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yeah,
my
instincts
are
to
say
there
ought
to
be
different
rules
in
those
cases,
that
congress--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
because
congress
would
have
looked
to
the
state--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
mean,
they...
well...
can
they
adopt
that
rule,
that
question
is
yes.
would
that
be
preempted,
the
answer
to
that
is
probably
no.
the
question
is,
would
a
federal
court
be
obliged
to
borrow
that
kind
of
a
direct
intrusion
into
the
manipulation,
or
whether
it
would
feel
more
comfortable
saying
that
interferes
with
a
federal
policy
in
a
way
that
would
require
us
to
set
it
aside.
that
seems
to
me
a
tough
question
to
answer
in
the
abstract,
but
those
are
the
legal
principles
that
i
think
would
apply--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
but
that's
true
in
lots
of
federal
statutes,
your
honor,
and
at
least
with
respect
to
626
and
the
important
elements
of
protection
of
federal
law
that
are
embodied
in
there,
i'm
not
saying
you
look
to
state-by-state
law
there.
it
seems
to
me
clear
the
interstices
of
that
provision,
because
it's
designed
to
oust
common
law,
you
have
to
come
in
with
federal
rules
to
do
that.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but
when
you
get
out
of
that
mold,
then
it
seems
to
me
you
almost
certainly
in
general
look
to
state
law,
because
that
really
will
tell
you
the
answer
for
most
day-to-day
primary
activities--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
that's
my
personal
preference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
what's
wrong
with
that
is,
that's
not
the
scheme
congress
adopted.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
the
other
side
of
it.
you
may
never
get
anything
back.
but
the
bottom
line
is
that
the
tender-back
rule
is
not
a
remedial
rule.
it
is
a
rule
that
serves
the
ends
of
justice
and
fairness,
but
it
does
so
substantively.
it
is
a
fundamental
principle
of
contract
law,
it
creates
an
independently
recognized
right,
it
is
enforceable
independently,
and
it
is
that
right
which
she
forfeited
and
which
justifies
the
dismissal
of
her
claim,
and
why
the
judgment
of
the
fifth
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i'll
yield
back
my
time.
