justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why?
why
would
congress
wanted
to
have
done
that,
because
what
you're
being
told,
i
think,
from
justice
scalia
and
others,
is
let's
imagine...
let's
imagine
that
a...
that
we
have
100,000
workers
who
are
quitting,
and
each
of
them
has
a
contract,
and
they
all
promise
not
to
bring
claims,
and
each
of
them
is
paid
[dollars]
5,000
for
that
promise.
all
right.
now,
very
few
of
them
will
have
real
adea
claims.
very
few.
but
suppose
they're
all
like
this,
that
they
didn't
comply
with
the
rule
exactly.
now,
on
your
theory
one
day
every
employer
is
going
to
wake
up
to
the
fact
that
he
hasn't
bought
a
single
thing
for
his
[dollars]
5,000,
and
somebody
might
go
around
and
collect
the
lawsuits
and
sue
everybody
and
get
the
money
back,
so
you'd
be
taking
from
100,000
or
90
of
the
100,000,
[dollars]
5,000
each
have
to
go
right
back.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you're
wrong,
all
that
happens
is
when
somebody
has
a
good
claim
they
have
to
put
up
a
little
bit
of
money
up
front,
whatever
the
proportionate
amount
of
the
adea
part
is,
which
might
be
[dollars]
500,
and
the
lawyer
could
front
it
for
him.
so
why
would
congress
want
the
result
that
you
want,
which
would
seem
to
put
at
risk
hundreds
of
thousands
of
workers
to
have
to
give
back
the
money
who
would
have
no
claim...
the
employer
would
sue
them...
and
at
the
same
time
to
protect
some
lawyer
from
not
having
to
put
up
a
very
little
money
up
front.
now,
i'm
putting
it
strongly,
but
it's
exactly
that
practical
consideration
that
i'm
very
disturbed
about
in
terms
of
your
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
not
practical,
it's
legal,
and
what
i'm
asking
is,
why
would
congress
have
wanted
that
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
not
talking
about
the
same
thing.
what
i'm
talking
about
is,
i
agree
with
you
the
contract
is
no
good.
i
agree
with
you
the
employee
can
sue.
i
agree
with
you
that
that
provision
in
the
contract
promising
not
to
sue
is
worthless.
it's
no
good.
the
question
involved
is
whether,
before
he
brings
the
lawsuit,
he
has
to
give
back
a
proportionate
share
of
the
money
that
he's
been
paid
for
his
promise
not
to
sue.
i
would
imagine
if
they're
paying
five
or
[dollars]
6,000
for
such
a
promise
he'd
have
to
give
[dollars]
500
back,
or...
and
the
lawyer
could
put
it
up
front.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
is
the
big
problem
about...
that
you're
worried
about?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
understand
that.
am
i
missing
a...
i
mean,
i
only
have
one
question,
really,
for
this
side
of
the
case,
and
i
couldn't
find
the
answer
in
any
brief,
and
it
seemed
so
obvious
i
must
be
missing
something.
that
is,
i
absolutely
take
in
your
point
that
if
the
worker
has
to
front
the
money
sometimes
they
won't
have
it,
and
maybe
their
lawyer
wouldn't
give
it
to
them.
i
see
that
as
a
problem.
i
don't
think
it
makes
the
worker
back
at
stage
zero,
but
it
could
be
a
problem.
but
if
we
agree
with
you,
everyone's
been
pointing
out
that
in
all
the
millions
of
retirements
contracts
in
the
united
states,
every
one
that
doesn't
comply
with
all
this
is
void,
and
why
won't,
at
some
day,
some
clever
person
work
out
that
he
could
go
from
employer
to
employer,
buy
up
tens
of
thousands
of
suits,
and
all
the
people
who
don't
have
adea
claims
will
have
to
give
back
several
thousand
dollars
to
their
employer?
i
mean,
it's
the
people
who
don't
have
the
claim
who
vastly
outnumber
the
ones
who
do,
who
would
be
suddenly
left
high
and
dry,
on
your
theory,
at
the
mercy
of
whether
an
employer
would
just
decide
to
sue
him
for
the
money
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
that
seems
to
me
an
obvious
point,
but
no
one
mentions
it,
and
therefore
i
must
be
missing
something,
so
i
want
you
to
tell
me
what
i'm
missing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
i'm
talking
about
workers
who
don't...
they're
happy.
there
are
millions
of
them.
they
have
their
contracts
and
they
have
[dollars]
6,000
to
boot,
and
they
don't
have
a
dream
of
a
claim,
and
those
workers,
on
your
theory,
it
seems
to
me,
if
the
provision
in
the
contract
is
void,
are
at
the
mercy
of
any
lawyer
working
for
an
employer
who
would
ask
for
the
money
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
not
enforceable,
why...
it's
the
fourth
time
i've
said
the
exact...
i
must
be
not
be
saying
it
well.
suppose
it's
not
enforceable.
it's
then
void.
there
is
no
such
provision.
each
worker
is
there
with
[dollars]
4,000
that
he
got.
why
can't
the
employer
just
sue
him
to
get
the
[dollars]
4,000
back?
he
was
unjustly
enriched.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
wait...
wait.
can
i
just
go
right
into
that,
because
my
professor
was
jack
dawson,
who
was
a
fabulous
first-year--
[laughter]
any
failing
is
one
of
my
own
memory.
but
the...
my
belief...
i
thought
of
this,
is,
there
is
no
contract.
we
don't
have
to
rescind
it.
there's
a
contract,
but
the
provision
at
issue
is
void...
it's
not
there.
forget
the
word
void.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
invalid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
gone.
pretend
it
isn't
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
at
that
point,
we
have
a
human
being
called
a
worker
who
has
some
money
that
the
employer
paid
him,
and
i
would
have
guessed,
because
i
don't
remember
the
course
that
well,
that
he
is
entitled,
the
employer,
to
get
back
the
money
to
the
extent
that
the
employee
has
been
unjustly
enriched,
and
i
would
think
that
he
has
been
unjustly
enriched
only
to
the
extent
that
he
received
money
for
a
promise
not
to
sue
which
is
invalid,
i.e.,
only
in
respect
to
the
adea
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore,
what
happens
all
the
time
in
unjust
enrichment,
we
have
difficult
questions
to
look
into,
and
therefore
he
wouldn't
get
back
[dollars]
6,000
here.
he
would
get
back
a
proportionate
share.
no.
the
employee
would
have
to
give...
why
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
rule
wasn't
adopted
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
entirety
of
consideration
for
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right,
i'll
take
it...
i'll
go
to
voidable,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
entirety
of
the
consideration
for?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
that
portion--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
other
words,
if
he
was
paid
[dollars]
10
million
as
part
of
a
golden
parachute,
and
the
entire...
and
just
in
that
golden
parachute
contract,
which
is
48
pages
long,
there's
only
one
line
talking
about
a
promise
not
to
sue,
he
has
to
give
back
the
whole
[dollars]
4
million,
or
[dollars]
10
million?
