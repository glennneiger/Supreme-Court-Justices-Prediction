ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
to
respond
to
the
concerns
that
the
court
has
raised,
we
would
agree
that
the
congressional
scheme
that
has
been
established
here
addresses
these
concerns
in
that
congress
gave
the
courts
broad
equitable
authority,
and
the
court
recognized
that
in
mckennon,
that
that
equitable
authority
is
something
that
the
district
courts
in
adea
cases
exercised
to
take
into
account
concerns
of
employers.
that
is
consistent
with
the
common
law
trend,
also.
as
respondent
pointed
out
in
its
brief,
the
common
law
tender-back
was
not
required
in
equity,
generally.
it
was
only
for
settlement
releases,
and
in
those
cases
those
were...
the
cases
we've
seen
are
ones
that
only
had
one
topic
of
the
release,
so
by
suing
you
were
undoing
the
release.
but
in
cases
like
this,
this
is
a
waiver
that
violates
a
statute.
at
common
law,
that
was
one
of
the
major
bases
for
not
enforcing
a
contract.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
believe--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we
do
believe
it
goes
beyond
that,
the
requires
provision
of
information,
a
lot
more
protection
than
the
common
law.
whether--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
believe
that
the
waiver
of
the
adea
claim
is
void,
your
honor.
at
common
law
what
they
would
have
done
with
something
like
that,
they
would
have
applied
the
practice
of
divisibility.
when
there
was
an
illegal
contract
for
gambling,
or
something
that
violated
an
antitrust
statute,
they
would
look
and
see
if
that
statute
was
divisible.
if
it
was
not
divisible,
often
illegal
contracts
parties
were
left
as
they
were.
there
were
some
exceptions
to
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
it
may
very
well
be.
i
mean,
part
of
the
thing
that
is
even
more
complicated,
your
honor,
much
more
consideration
was
given
for
the
[dollars]
6,000
than
an
adea
waiver.
petitioner
resigned
from
her
job,
in
addition
to
waiving
other
claims,
so
there's
a
lot
of
equity,
and
that's
exactly
what
courts
of
equities
would
look
at,
and
that's
why
that
decision
was
made
at
the
remedy
phase
of
the
proceeding,
where
the
court
could
take
into
account
those
equitable
concerns,
and
we--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no.
we
believe
that
congress
made
clear
in
this
statute
that
waivers
were
void
if
they
did
not
comply
with
these
requirements.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
that
means
that
that
waiver
violates
the
statute.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
so
it's
an
illegal
waiver.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
at
common
law
a
tender-back
was
just
not
that...
all...
farnsworth,
dobbs,
and
all
of
your
discussions
make
clear
that
tender-back
was
not
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
problem--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
problem
is
the
statute,
your
honor.
it's
congress.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
but--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--but
you
are
creat...
you
would
be
creating
another
condition
precedent
to
bringing
suit,
and
congress
was
very
clear
about
what
was
required
in
that
event,
and
it--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
believe
in--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--in
626,
your
honor.
it's
enfolding
respondent's
brief
in
the
appendix.
(f)(1)
makes
quite
clear
congress
expressly
said
an
individual
may
not
waive
any
right
or
claim--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
we
believe
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
we
believe,
when
you
look
at
the...
for
example,
(f)(3),
where
congress
foresaw
that
there
would
be
disputes
among
parties
about
the
validity
of
these
waivers,
congress
specifically
said
the
burden
would
be
on
the
employer,
or
the
person
asserting
the
validity
of
the
waiver.
in
this
case
it
would
be--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--because
tender
back,
your
honor,
was
to
put
up
the
money
to
counter
the
presumption
of
the
validity
of
the
contract,
and
here
it's
to
the
contrary.
congress
has
supplanted
that,
and
i
think
it's
important
to--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
but
your
honor,
in
case--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
because
i
think
that
the
tender
back
clearly
conflicts
with
the
purposes
and
the
construct,
the
mechanism
which
congress
created.
to
impose--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--certainly,
your
honor.
in
the
first
section
of
the
adea,
621,
congress
made
a
specific
find
or
example
that
older
workers
are
much
less
likely
to
retain
and
regain
employment
once
they're
terminated,
so
it's
a
specific
class.
the
legislative
history
also
concerns
information
about
that.
also,
even
where
courts
have
applied
a
tender-back
requirement
as
judge
posner
did
in
his
opinion
for
the
seventh
circuit
in
a
title
vii
case,
he
recognized
that
where
there
was
a
situation
in
which
living
expenses
would
preclude
the
bringing
of
the
suit,
that
would
not
be
permitted
as
a
matter
of
equity.
he
also
pointed
out
that,
you
know,
perhaps
an
offer
would
be
sufficient,
would
be
offset
at
the
remedial
phase.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
an
offset
remedy,
and
i
just
have
to
urge
the
court
to
realize
that
to
adopt
the
court
of
appeals
approach
would
be
to
put
the
workers
exactly
back
where
they
were
before
enactment
of
the
statute.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
congress
has
spoken,
has
established
this
very
specific
scheme--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
congress
created
that
because
to
impose
tender-back
would
be
nullify
the
statute--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
equitable
authority
of
the
court.
that's
clear,
and
this
court
has,
you
know,
agreed
with
that
in
mckennon.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
congress
gave
it
remedial
authority
in
626(b)...
or...
yes,
626(b)
of
the
act,
and
made
clear
all
the
remedies
that
the
court
could
give,
and
it's
important
to
realize
that
at
this
point
if
this
worker
has
to
make
a
choice
of
whether
to
have
the
severance
pay
or
a
waiver,
that
worker
is
exactly
where
they
were
before
passage
of
the
act.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
your
honor
is
pointing
out
the
fact
that
it's
unclear
whether
a
worker
could
even
avoid
this
waiver
if
they
wanted
to
enforce--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--again,
your
honor,
we
don't
believe
so.
it's
an
illegal
contract
that
is
not
enforceable
even
at
the
common
law--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
may
i
answer?
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
at
common
law
there
could...
we
don't
want
to
preclude
that
there
would
never
be
an
unjust
enrichment
situation.
perhaps
it
was
some
egregious
unjust
enrichment,
but
at
common
law
those
would
have
been
exceptions
to
the
principle
that
illegal
contracts
were
against
public
policy
and
the
parties
were
left
as
they
were.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
thank
you,
your
honor.
