justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
haynie,
we
aren't
sure
about
that,
because
congress
did
not
expressly
say
such
an
agreement
that
fails
to
comply
with
these
requirements
is
void,
as
they
have
done
in
some
other
legislation.
they
don't
say
that,
so
at
common
law
i
suppose
an
agreement
where
the
employer
was
guilty
of
some
kind
of
fraud,
duress,
or
coercion
would
be
voidable,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
voidable
at
the
option
of
the
person
defrauded.
maybe
this
contract
is
voidable,
not
void.
congress
didn't
say,
one
way
or
another.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
courts
have
routinely
said
they
are
unable
to
make
that
kind
of
a
determination.
i
mean,
they
can't
do
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
get
a...
you
either
have
to
give
it
all
back
or
none,
as
i
see
it.
i
don't
see
how
that
could
possibly
be
made.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
haynie,
could
i--
--and
state
law
might
operate
as
well
to
say
that
it's
not
severable,
that
you
can't
decide
how
much
goes
to
adea
and
how
much
consideration--
--yes,
right.
--went
to
these
other
claims.
that's
possible,
too,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
void
or
voidable?
at
common
law,
it
would
have
been
voidable
for
fraud
or
coercion
or
duress,
and
this
is
a
substitute
for
that.
this
is
a
statutory
expression
of
conditions
that
have
to
be
there
to
avoid
any
kind
of
coercion
or
fraud,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
isn't
it
voidable
at
the
instance
of
the
employee?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
saying
that
we
have
to
enact
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
some
rule
about
tender-back,
or
do
we
look
to
state
law
to
see
what
the
normal
contract
situation
would
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we...
suppose
we
don't
find
an
express
provision
in
the
statute
governing
tender-back.
do
we
look
to
the
state
law
where
the
contract
was
created?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
do
we
try
to
create
some
federal
legal
principle
to
cover
this?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
tender-back--
--well,
what
was
the
common
law,
though,
if
it
was
void?
was
it
the
situation
that
the
parties
might
be
left
where
the
law
found
them
at
the
time
it
was
voided?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
might
not
be
a
tender-back
requirement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
it
were
totally
void.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your
argument
depends
upon
our
determining
that
the
waiver
is
voidable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if,
in
fact,
it's
void,
we're
faced
with
something
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
several
questions--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
it
didn't
cover
in
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think...
are
we
really
dealing
here
with
whether
we
should
construct
some
principle
of
federal
law
to
fill
in
a
gap?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
in
hogue,
which
you
say
doesn't
directly
apply
here
because
in
fela
congress
said
it's
going
to
be
void,
but
nonetheless
at
the
end
of
the
day
in
hogue
the
court
said
we're
going
to
require
an
offset
at
the
end
of
the
day.
if
the
plaintiff
recovers
something
under
the
fela
claim
we'll
offset
whatever
the
employer
already
had
paid.
now,
what
about
such
a
provision?
i
guess
the
court
was
crafting
some
principle
of
federal
law
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
maybe
it
should
do
that
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
does
that
partially
meet
your
concern?
