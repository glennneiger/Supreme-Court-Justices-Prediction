justice
david
h.
souter
as
to
them,
then,
the
employer
can,
on
day
eight,
say,
i'm
not
going
to
pay
anything
insofar
as
it
might
be
attributable...
let's
assume,
keep
the
example,
that
he
broke
down
the
various
considerations
and
said,
with
respect
to
this
particular
claim
i'm
not
going
to
pay
anything
because
it's
void,
because
it
violates
the
statute.
that
would
be
legally
proper,
i
take
it,
on
your
view.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
a
proportionate
share
be
determined?
how
do
we
determine
the
proportionate
share?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
you
don't
have
to
have
judicial
common
law
development
with
respect
to
the
protections
of
this
statute,
i
suppose,
in
order
to
recognize
that
if
on
a
void
contract
there
is
a
total
failure
of
consideration
the
employer
at
least
would
have
the
right
to
bring
action
for
the
return
of
the
consideration
that
he
has
furnished,
and
do
you
deny
that
he
would
have
such
an
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
not
talking
about
tender-backs.
i'm
simply
saying,
let's
assume
that
your
conclusion
is
correct,
and
we
recognize
it.
the
employer
says...
and
by
the
way,
we're
operating
here
on
the
hypothesis
that
it's
only
the
age
claim
that's
involved.
the
employer
says,
i
got
nothing.
there
has
been
a
total
failure
of
consideration.
i
want
my
money
back.
the
employer
can
sue
for
it,
can't
he?
he
may
have
a
tough
time
collecting
it.
you've
pointed
out,
and
i'm
sure
you're
right,
that
in
most
of
these
cases
the
money
has
been
spent,
but
the...
we
don't
have
to
deny
the
employer
the
cause
of
action
to
get
the
consider...
to
get
his
consideration
back
in
order
to
enforce
this
act,
do
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
not
denying
that,
are
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
you're
not
denying,
in
fact
i
think
you
suggest
it,
that
if
your
client
should
win,
quite
properly
if
the
employer
has
brought
his
claim
there
could
be
a
set-off
against
the
recovery.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
a
factual
question.
we've
all
been
making
the
same
assumption
here,
but
let
me
just
question
the
assumption.
is
there
any
way
of
knowing,
in
the
run-of-the-mill
situation
in
which
there
is
a
release
and
the
object,
the
obvious
principal
purpose
of
the
release
is
the
age
claim,
whether
in
those
cases
there
tends
to
be
a,
in
fact,
others
unrelated
claims?
i
mean,
for
example,
in
this
case,
was
she
an
employee
at-will,
so...
or
was
she
subject
to
some
kind
of
a
cause
requirement
so
that
she
would
have
had
a
lost
wage
claim?
because
if
most
of
these
releases
in
the
real
world
are
simply
releases
of
nothing
but
the
age
claim,
then
this
problem
that's
being
raised
would
loom
smaller
than
it
might
otherwise
be.
how
do
we...
is
there
any
way
for
us
to
know?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
i'm
sure
that's
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
--be
crazy
not
to,
but
in
fact,
do
you--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
there
any
way
for
us
to
know
whether
it's
really
covering
anything
else
in
most
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
know
what
the
language
of
the
waiver
says,
but
i
mean,
in
fact,
are
there
any
real
claims...
is
there
any
way
for
us
to
know
whether
there
are
in
fact
any
substantial
claims
in
most
of
these
cases,
other
than
the
age
claim?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
brinkmann,
may
i
ask
you
to
address
a
specific
point
there?
i
thought
one
of
the
strongest,
if
not
the
strongest
argument
for
the
position
that
you
and
the
petitioner
take
is
that
if
you
require
a
tender
back,
the
prohibition
in
the
statute
is
a
dead
letter,
because
in
fact
you're
dealing
with
people
who
are
not
going
to
have
the
money
to
tender
back,
not
because
they
went
to
the
race
track
because
they
used
it
to
pay
the
rent
and
buy
the
food.
is
there
anything
we
can
look
at
to
find
out
whether
that...
that
seems
to
have
an
intuitive
appeal
to
it.
is...
has
it
gotten
anything
more
than
an
intuitive
appeal?
are
there
statistics
anywhere,
or
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
the
effect
that
that
is
so?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
i
will...
i
offer
to
pay
you
back
if
i
get
the
money
from
which
i
can
do
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
essential
to
your
case
that
she
signed
the
piece
of
paper,
and
that
the
piece
of
paper
has
the
effect
that
justice
stevens
has
been
positing
in
his
question.
the
signature
is
not
a
mere
incidental
fact
of
history.
it
has
an
operative
effect.
justice
david
h.
souter
or
you
might
pose
the
question,
how
far
are
you
going
to
allow
a
common
law
process
in
effect
to
thwart
the
statute,
and
if,
in
fact,
we
are
correct
in
the
intuitive
assumption
that
has
been
suggested
here,
that
in
most
of
these
cases
in
which
this
is
going
to
be
a
serious
question
the
worker
is
simply
not
going
to
be
in
a
position
to
make
the
tender,
then,
in
fact,
on
your
theory
the
statute
is
a
dead
letter.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
the
statute
hasn't
been.
i
mean,
we're
in
this
position
because
we've
got
a
fairly
unequivocal-looking
statute,
and
the
fact
that
the
common
law
may
have
operated
without
the
hindrance
of
statute
for
200
years
leaves
us,
i
think,
exactly
where
justice
stevens
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
--and
this
is
not
one
of
those,
so
in
this
case
i
take
it
your
position...
is
it
your
position
in
this
case
that
if
this
court
holds
that
the
entire
waiver
is
void,
that
any
employer
can
sue
to
get
the
entire...
in
effect
can
sue
to
rescind
the
contract?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now--
justice
david
h.
souter
--my
question
is...
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this.
i
wish
i'd
thought
of
it
before
argument,
but
my
question,
then,
is
this.
if
i
can
remember
back
to
first-year
contracts
i
thought
rescission
was
an
equitable
remedy.
wouldn't
the
court,
if
i'm
right,
simply
say
to
the
employer,
no,
you
can't
get
the
entire
consideration
back
because
they
waived
a
lot
of...
if
this
is
true,
you
know,
they
waived
other
things
besides
the
age
claim,
so
i'll
give
you
part
of
it
back.
i
will
come
up...
in
effect,
i'm
going
to
do
an
intellectual...
an
equitable
slice
here.
is
that
possible?
justice
david
h.
souter
he
was
very
good.
the
pupil
wasn't,
but
the
teacher
was
okay.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
severance
only
if
the--
--but
that's
on
the
assumption
that
it's
voidable,
and
the
assumption
of
the
question
is
that
it's
void.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'd--
justice
david
h.
souter
--could
this--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr
phillips--
justice
david
h.
souter
--could
we
solve
the
problem
this
way,
by
saying
that
the
tender-back
requirement
can
be
looked
at
as
essentially
a
remedial
condition.
we're
not
going
to
give
a
remedy
when
the
person
keeps
100
percent
of
what,
in
fact,
he
is
claiming
inoperative,
and
therefore
we're
going
to
leave
the
question
of
what
has
to
be,
in
effect,
tendered
and
ultimately
paid
back
to
the
remedy
stage.
at
the
remedy
stage,
the
federal
court
does
have
fairly
broad
powers
to
craft
a
remedy
without
any
violation
of
erie,
and
therefore
solve
both
the
problem
of
state
variation
and
the
tender-back
problem
by
saying
it's
going
to
be
a
remedial
issue
here.
what's
wrong
with
that?
