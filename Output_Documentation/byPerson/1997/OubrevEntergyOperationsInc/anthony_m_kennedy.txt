what
would
happen
in
the
case
if
the
day
after
the
release
is
signed,
but
before
any
money
changed
hands,
the
employer
says,
we've
made
a
mistake,
it's
a
good
faith
mistake,
we
didn't
know
about
the
adea,
we
want
to
rescind
the
release?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
this
is
the
employer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
change
the
hypothetical.
suppose...
i
want
the
release
to
be
effective.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
other
words
you
couldn't
have--
--doesn't
have
to
rescind
it.
excuse
me.
you
couldn't
have
an
equitable
action
to
rescind
the
release
at
the
employer's
behest?
let's
assume
a
good
faith
mistake
on
his
part.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then,
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay...
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay
any
of
the
money,
either?
right.
if
it's
void,
he
wouldn't
have
to
pay
the
money.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's,
it
seems
to
me,
one
of
the
points,
is
that
this
might
very
well
be
valid
as
to
everything
but
the
adea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
there's
a
lot
of
talk
on
void
and
voidable,
but
this
covers
so
many
claims
that
it
seems
to
me
that's
something
that
may
be
more
of
a
problem
for
the
respondent
than
for
you.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
if
you
say
the
contract
is
void,
then
what
you're
doing
is
saying
that
the
adea
tail
wags
the
state
law
dog
with
respect
to
all
releases.
you
are
saying
that
all
state
law
releases,
state
claim
releases
are,
i
take
it,
void
because
the
contract
is
not
severable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
it
void?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
it...
is
it
divisible
in
most
cases
here,
do
you
think?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
where
do
you
get
the
offset
authority?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
the
court
have
equitable
authority
at
the
end
of
the
case
but
not
the
beginning?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
response
to
justice
stevens'
point
that
i
still
think
we'd
better
get
straight,
if
we're
the
trial
court,
you
don't
say
that
the
suit
cannot
proceed
because
the
money
was
not
paid
back.
you
say
the
suit
was
not...
cannot
proceed
because
(a)
the
money
was
not
paid
back,
and
(b)
that
allows
you
to
plead
the
waiver.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
statute
says
the
individual
can't
waive.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
ask--
--and
you
say
that
under
the
federal
common
law...
we
have
two
cases.
case
one,
there's
a
release
that
says
adea
release,
but
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
statute.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
other
case
is
a
case
like
this
in
which,
let
us
say,
there
might
have
been
some
substantial
state
law
claims
that
were
released
as
well
as
the
adea
claim.
it
also
is
void.
you
say
the
two
cases
are
exactly
the
same.
