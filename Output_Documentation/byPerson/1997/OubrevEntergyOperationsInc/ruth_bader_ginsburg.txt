ms.
haynie,
suppose--
--ms.
haynie,
did...
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
argument,
but
i
thought
your
position
was,
may
not
waive
is...
leaves
employer
and
employee
without
any
authority,
without
any
power
to
do
anything
with
respect
to
the
adea
claim.
that
being
so,
you
construe
this
contract
as
though
what
may
not
be
done
wasn't
done,
so
that
the
only
thing
that
would
be
covered
would
be
the
non-adea
claims.
maybe
you're
not
making
that
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
this
would
waive
title
vii
claims,
too,
i
suppose.
this
waiver,
if
i
remember
correctly,
waived
any
and
all
claims.
it
didn't
mention
any
specific
ones.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
apart
from
state
law
claims
and
title
vii
claims
raised
with
sex
discrimination,
would
there
be
anything
else
that
might
be
included
in
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we
have
an
example,
mr.
phillips
of
state
law...
of
a
state
law
that
says
may
not
waive,
do
you
agree
that
that's...
the
essence
of
this
case
is
for
us
to
construe
what
those
words
mean,
may
not
waive,
and
i
take
that
to
be
an
instruction
to
the
employer
as
well
as
to
the
employee,
so
may
i
ask
you
to
respond
to
the
question
that
i
put
to
ms.
haynie?
that
is,
one
way
to
look
at
what
congress
did,
these
words,
may
not
waive,
is
to
say,
well,
that's
a
condition,
that
whatever
else
this
contract
does,
it
can't
do
that.
the
employer
doesn't
have
the
power
to
put
it
in,
the
employee
doesn't
have
the
power
to
agree
to
it,
so
the
contract...
the
employer
knowing
that
full
well,
by
the
way...
the
contract
then
must
be
construed
to
waive
the
host
of
other
claims
that
are
waivable,
and
it's
enforceable
to
the
extent
that
it
doesn't
include
the
one
thing
that
congress
says
thou
shalt
not.
so
it's
perfectly
good
to
waive
title
vii,
to
waive
a
slew
of
other
claims.
why
isn't
that
the
most
sensible
reading
of
the
may-not-waive
language?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
just
may
not
waive
this
one
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
think
they
can
waive...
they
can
waive
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
the
common
law
in
a
state
were
not
the
unreasonable
position
that
a
may-not-waive
provision
leaves
both
sides
powerless,
so
the
contract
is
construed,
as
justice
stevens
suggested,
to
cover
everything
else
that
could
be
covered
to
dispose
of
anything
the
parties
could
dispose
of,
but
just
as
though
it
weren't
there,
the
thing
that
they
can't
dispose
of,
so
the
common
law,
let's,
say,
in
new
york
or
new
jersey
was
not
as
you
described
it
to
be
in
louisiana,
could
we
then
say
that
for
these
kinds
of
claims
the
age
discrimination
act
is
going
to
mean
one
thing
in
one
state,
another
thing
in
another
state,
or
that
there
will
be
the
federal
common
law
so
that
you'd
have
the
same
rule
in
all
the
states?
