we'll
hear

operations,

ms.

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
it
was
just
an
adea
claim
here,
so
that
we
didn't
have
the
problem
of
breaking
out
a
partial
amount,
and
the...
would
you
say
that
the
employee
did
not
have
to
tender
it
back?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
plaintiff
just
gets
to
keep
it,
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
there's
a
considerable
concern.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
supposing
the
plaintiff
loses
at
the
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean--
--that's
totally
contrary
to
any
concept
of
the
law
of
contracts.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
may
be
dealing
with
the
law
of
contracts
except
as
congress
has
otherwise
provided.
you're
arguing
for
a
very
expansive
construction
of
a
particular
language
of
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
don't
ordinarily
get
into
legislative
history.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
haynie.
ms.
brinkmann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
says
nothing
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
was
that
clarity
manifested?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
section
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
know
that,
but
you're
saying
that
congress
made
expressly
clear
that
no
tender
back
would
be
required.
where
is
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
congress
made
expressly
clear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
that
have
to
do
about
tender
back?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
certainly
is
not
an
express
provision
about
tender
back,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
said
it
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
point
is
that
the
fela
language
about
void
does
not
find
a
counterpart
in
the
adea.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
also,
what
if
the
plaintiff
loses
the
suit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
