justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
let
me
just
raise
a
question
that...
you
know
somebody's
got
to
ask
you
a
question
about
this.
i
agree
with
everything
in
your
brief
about
the
common
law,
the
equities,
the
fairness,
but
the
statute
never
says
anything
about
void
or
voidable,
but
the
statute
does
say,
an
individual
may
not
waive
this
claim
unless
the
waiver
complies
with
the
statute,
and
in
this
case
the
waiver
did
not
comply
with
the
statute.
if
they
do
not
come
up
with
the
money
to
pay
you
in
advance,
is
it
not
true
you
claim
you
would
have
a
defense
to
the
suit
which
would
be
a
waiver?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
is
your
defense
to
the
suit?
is
it
not
the
document
that
she
signed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
should
she
have
to...
what
in
the
statute
compels
her
to
tender
anything
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
she
has
not...
you
say
there's
just
no
waiver
issue
at
all,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
she
had
never
signed
a
contract
she
wouldn't
have
to
do
that.
if
she'd
never
signed
the
waiver
she
would
not
have
to
do
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
say
she
signed
no
document
whatsoever,
and
you
just
said
to
her,
we
think
you've
been
a
wonderful
employee,
we
don't
think
you're
going
to
sue
us,
here's
a
lot
of
money.
would
she
have
to
give
that
back?
justice
john
paul
stevens
to
bring
an
adea
suit?
why?
if
she
never
signed
a
release
she
wouldn't
have
to
give
anything
back,
would
she?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you...
i'm
asking
you,
would
you
have
a
defense
to
this
case
if
she
had
not
signed
a
release?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
heart
of
your
defense
is
the
fact
she
signed
a
document
that
she
has
not
rescinded.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
want
to
avoid
a
release.
that's
what...
the
payback
is
in
order
to
make
something
that
is
voidable...
keep
it
alive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
with
you
on
the
common
law
entirely.
my
question
is,
how
can
you
get
around
the
statutory
language
that
says
she
may
not
waive
unless
you
comply
with
the
statute,
and
you're
saying
she
did
waive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
duty
would
not
arise
unless
she'd
signed
a
waiver.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
significant
in
this
case
for
another
reason.
this
waiver
is
void
only
insofar
as
it
waives
fe...
adea
claims.
it
doesn't
purport
to
make
the
entire
document
void.
it
just
says
it
cannot
operate
as
a
waiver
of
this
particular
cause
of
action.
so
it's
void
pro
tanto.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's
a
very
good
reason.
it
did
not
want
to
create
the
specter
that
justice
breyer's
example
creates
of
creating
everything
void.
it
just
said
it's
void
insofar
as
it
affects
this
particular
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't
say
void.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says,
it
shall
not
operate
as
a
waiver
of
this
narrow
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
can't
give
effect
to
that
language,
as
i
understand
your
position,
and
still
say
she
has
to
tender
back.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
phillips,
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
i
also
took
contracts
in
law
school
by
the
way.
[laughter]
supposing
one
reads
the
statute
noting
that
it
doesn't
use
the
word
void
or
voidable,
they're
simply
saying
that
when
you
have
a
release
which
purports
to
release
19
different
claims,
and
if
one
of
those
claims
is
an
adea
claim
the
release
shall
not
be
enforceable
insofar
as
it
purports
to
release
that
claim,
because
that
would
be
a
waiver...
they
don't
even
talk
about
void
or
voidable...
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
reasonable
reading
of
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
question
doesn't
it
answer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
says
it
shall
not
be
enforceable,
period,
regardless
of
whether
you're
able
or
willing
or
not
to
tender
back.
doesn't...
isn't
it
perfectly
clear
what
the
mean...
and
isn't
that
a
fair
reading
of
the
plain
language
of
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
meaning
is,
it
shall
not
be
enforceable
as
to
that
narrow
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
much
broader
than
the
statutory
language
that
says
you
may
not
waive
that
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which,
they
put
the
employer
on
notice
that
if
they
want
this
to
cut
off
the
adea
claim
they
must
comply
with
these
provisions,
which
your
client
didn't
comply
with.
justice
john
paul
stevens
therefore,
you
have
a
perfectly
valid
document
as
to
everything
except
the
adea
claim.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
don't
understand
why
that
doesn't
fit
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
last
part
that's
not
in
the
statute,
that
you're
bringing
in
against
those
common
law
doctrines.
you've
just
acknowledged
that
this
modified
the
common
law
by
saying
you
don't
have
those
thresholds,
you
have
a
statutory
threshold--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
your
client
did
not
comply
with.
