ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
after
2
years
of
careful
consideration,
in
response
to
a
regulatory
void,
congress
enacted
the
older
worker
benefit
protection
act
to
protect
the
rights
of
older
workers
who
were
in
greater
force
leaving...
being
forced
to
leave
the
work
place.
the
older
worker
benefit
protection
act
mandates
that
an
older
worker
may
not
waive
their
rights
secured
under
the
adea
unless
such
waiver
is
knowing
and
voluntary
as
defined
by
the
act.
if
an
employer
chooses
to
utilize
a
waiver
of
age
discrimination
rights,
congress
requires
an
employer
to
provide
the
older
worker
with
the
requisite
information
and
time
to
assess
the
value
of
the
right
to
be
waived.
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals'
adoption
of
the
common
law
contract
principles
of
ratification
and
tender-back
in
addressing
a
situation
where
the
employer
uses
a
waiver
which
is...
does
not
comply
with
the
older
worker
benefit
protection
act
will
in
all
practical
purpose
render
the
act
meaningless.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well,
your
honor,
pursuant
to
the
statute
there
is
a
revocation
period
of
7
days
after
the
release
is
signed.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
i
understand.
there
will
be
a
7-day--that
release
is
not
effective
pursuant
to--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--7
days
after
it.
the
employer
would
not
have
the
right
to
rescind
the
release.
it
is
an
invalid
release
with
regard
to
adea
claims
if
it
does
not
comply
with
the
statute.
if
they
rescind
the
release
to
all
other
waivers,
i
believe
the
plaintiff
or
the
older
worker
will
have
the
right
to
proceed
against
the
employer.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
no,
sir.
if
the
waiver
does
not
comply
with
the
requirements
of
the
act,
it
is
a
void
waiver
pursuant
to--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--well,
the
problem
with
not
having
to
pay
the
money,
your
honor,
is
that
the
waiver
includes,
and
particularly
in
this
case,
many
other
actions,
other
than
a
waiver
of
adea--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--and
i
believe
that--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--i
believe
it
would
be
void
to
the
adea
claims.
i
believe
that--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
that
would
be,
and
the
plaintiff
can
go
forward
and
pursue
their
age
discrimination
claim
in
court.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well,
i
think
congress
has
clearly
spoken
here
that
if
the
waiver
drafted
by
the
employer
does
not
comply
with
the
older
worker
benefit
protection
act--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--that
waiver
is
nonenforceable--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--because
i
do
believe
the
other
portions
of
that
waiver
remain
valid.
if
the
employer
does
not
break
out
the
enumeration
for
each
right
to
be
waived,
that's
the
argument
to
save
the
set-off
for
the
remedial
phase
of
the
trial.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
if
they
choose
to
stop
paying
money
and
have
not
enumerated
out
which
moneys
are
going
to
be
designated
for
which
rights
are
being
waived,
then
i
believe
the
plaintiff
has
a
simple
right
of
breach
of
contract
for
all
other
rights
that
they
had
signed,
if
the
money
has
stopped.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well,
i--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--i--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--i
agree,
your
honor,
i
believe
that's
one
of
the
practical
problems
of
this
case,
and
that's
why
the
tender
back
at
the
very
beginning
of
a
case
to
bar
plaintiff
to
going
into
court
is
very
prac...
impractical.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well,
i
believe
that's
what
congress
has
established--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--that's
correct.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
i
believe
the
phrase,
may
not
waive,
is
tantamount
to
announce,
or
proclaiming
void
any
waivers
which
do
not
comply
with
the
older
worker
benefit
protection
act
for
those
rights
secured
under
the
adea.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
your
honor,
with
regard
to
the
practical--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--congress
was
very
clear
in
enacting
this
statute
to
protect
the
rights
of
older
workers
when
negotiating
with
employers
when
they're
forced
out
of
the
work
place.
they
are
not
arm-length
negotiators.
congress
put
in
very
specific
requirements
an
employer
must
meet
so
that
an
employee
knows
they
are
giving
up
a
valuable
right
in
exchange
for
that
consideration.
if
they're
given
adequate
considera...
or
information,
and
there
is
some
specter
of
discrimination,
then
the
employer
can
go...
the
employee
can
go
back
to
the
employer
and
negotiate
for
a
greater
severance
or
say,
no,
i'm
not
going
to
sign
this.
without
that
knowledge,
and
without
the
time
to
consider
it
in
a
coercion
case,
then
the
employee
is
really
left
with
no
option
but
to
take
the
money.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--the
problem
is
twofold,
your
honor.
first,
the
monetary
amount
could
be
greater.
the
employee
expends
the
money
looking...
for
living
expenses
while
looking
for
other
employment.
the
second
problem
is,
who
is
to
decide
what
the
proportionate
share
will
be?
that's
going
to
have
to
be
decided
by
a
trier
of
fact,
a
judicial
tribunal.
that
means
you're
in
court
already.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
the
proportionate
share
can
be
determined
at
the
end
of
the
litigation,
when
a
trial
judge
has
taken
into--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--well,
if
you--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--if
you
require
the
plaintiff
to
tender
back
all
the
money
received,
then
it
is
the
employer
who
receives
the
windfall
there,
because
the
employee
has
waived
many
other
rights
under
that
waiver.
the
employer
can
raise
the
defense.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
no,
i
don't
believe
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
believe
that.
i
believe
congress
spoke
directly
and
specifically
to
those
rights
secured
under
the
adea.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
no,
i
am
making
that
argument,
your
honor,
that
again
the
statute
speaks
specifically
to
adea
claims,
and
those
are
the...
that
is
the
waiver
that
is
void.
that
is
the
waiver
that
is
nonenforceable
against
the
plaintiff
who
signs
it.
all
other
waivers
of
claims
can
be
possibly
enforceable
against
the
plaintiff,
unless
the
plaintiff
can
show
that
it
was
not
an
involuntary
waiver.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
the
waiver
does
not
comply
with
the
statute
it
is
an
ineffective
waiver.
it
is
a
void
waiver.
the
plaintiff
can
go
forward
with
the
lawsuit,
and
if
there
is
some--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--well,
there's
a
concern
with
regard
to
equity
amongst
the
parties.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
it
can
come
at
the
remedial
phase
of
the
trial--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--with
either
an
offset--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--i
believe
that
part
of
the
incentive
in
complying
with
the
statute
is
a
loss
of
that
money,
the
severance
pay,
if
you
do
not
draft
a
valid
waiver
under
the
older
worker
benefits
act.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well,
this
is...
we're
not
dealing
with
the
law
of
contracts.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
it's
warranted
in
this
case.
the
legislative
history
is
replete
and
is
quite
full
with
congress'
intent.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
and
i
understand,
your
honor,
but
congress'
intent
to
occupy
this
entire
area.
in
fact,
the
respondent
has
conceded
that
in
enacting
this
statute
there
is
as
federal
statutory
standard
for
knowing
and
voluntary.
it
is
all-encompassing.
there
is
no
room
for
judicial
common
law
development
here.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
your
honor,
to
require
the
tender
back
would
be
to
engraft
on
the
statute--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--well,
your
honor,
there
may
be
some
state
claims
in
restitution
or
unjust
enrichment
that
the
employer
could
bring.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
certainly.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
no,
certainly
i'm
not
denying
that.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
and
to
try
to
place
the--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
it's
possible,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
the
trial
court
will
be
in
the
best
position,
after
all
the
evidence
is
taken
in--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--to
assess
the
values
of
this
claim.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well,
your
honor--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--i
believe
that
is
what
the
trial
court
is
going
to
be
charged
with
doing.
if
you
attempt
to
put
the
parties
back
into
the
places
they
were
before
the
invalid
waiver
was
offered
to
the
employee,
you
must
then
give
ms.
oubre
her
lost
wages,
you
must
put
her
in
a
position
again
of
making
the
decision
as
to
whether
she
wants
to
stay
with
the
company
or
leave
the
company,
and
you
also
must
provide
all
the
information
required
by
the
act,
which
the
respondent
has
not
done
to
date
in
this
case.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well,
i
could
tell
you
factually
for
this
situation
she
was
an
at-will
employee,
and
certainly
these
waivers
contain...
i've
never
seen
a
waiver
that
just
contains
an
adea
waiver.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
they
contain
numerous
other
waivers
with
regard
to
worker's
compensation.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
all
other
waivers.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
i
believe
that
the
language
of
the
waiver--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--well,
if
the
plaintiff
brings
the
suit,
obviously,
or
files
her
claim
against...
files
her
claim
with
the
eeoc,
or,
you
know,
the
state
regulatory
agency--
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
barbara
g.
haynie
well,
there's
workers'
compensation
claims.
there
could
be
any
other
causes
of
action
that
may
have
come
up.
