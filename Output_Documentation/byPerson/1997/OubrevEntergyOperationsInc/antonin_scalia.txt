justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
order
to
determine
how
much
harm
we're
doing
by
saying
these
things
are
void
from
the
outset
i
think
we
should
be
realistic
and
know
that
most
of
them
do
not
assign
a
certain
amount
of
money
to
the
adea
release
and
a
certain
amount
of
money
to
various
other
releases,
and
i
doubt
very
much,
when
it's
not
broken
out
that
way,
whether
you
can
say
the
contract
is
valid
in
part
and
invalid
as
to
that
one
little
item.
i
mean,
this
is
a
standard
question
of
severability.
i
don't
know
how
you
can
rip
that
contract
apart,
especially
when
the
adea
claim
is
a
very
major
part
of
the
consideration.
do
you
know
any
other
contract
that's
picked
apart
like
that
where
it's
just
partially
valid
and
we're
going
to
enforce
all
the
rest
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
therefore
that
portion
of
the
contract
is
bad,
and
i
would
say
the
whole
contract
is
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
the
employers
who
have
these,
have
made
these
commitments
can
now
simply
stop
paying
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
a
contract
is...
you
can't
pick
apart
a
contract
like
that.
if
the
contract's
void,
it's
void.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
he's
breached
it?
how
much
money
is
he
supposed
to
pay,
two-thirds
of
the
full
contract,
or...
i
mean,
how
do
you
decide
how
much?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
full
amount?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i
am
worried
about
is,
you
are
destroying
cause...
you
are
destroying
entitlements
to
these
payments
on
the
part
of
all
older
workers
who
have
been
terminated,
including
the
majority
of
them
who
do
not
have
any
adea
claims.
i'm
not
sure
you're
doing
them
a
favor.
you're
saying
if
the
employer
is
confident
enough
that
this
worker
doesn't
have
an
adea
claim
he
can
just
say,
i'm
sorry,
we
made
a
mistake.
justice
antonin
scalia
well--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
right?
ms.
haynie,
suppose
i
sell
you
five
tickets
on
horses
in
a
horse
race,
okay.
one
of
them
wins.
the
other
four
don't,
okay.
do
you
think
that
it's
fair
if
the
contract
should
be
rescinded
as
to
only
one
of
those
tickets,
one
of
the
losing
ones,
that
you
should
get
back
20
percent
of
your
money?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that
is
what
is
called
an
aleatory
contract,
a
contract
that
depends
on
future
events
to
some
extent,
as
does
any
waiver
of
rights.
you
don't
know
whether
the
person
has
claims
that
he
will
sue
on
or
not.
when
he
does
have
one,
is
it
fair
to
say,
well,
that
claim
was
one-fifth
of
the
whole
contract,
we'll
give
you
one-fifth
of
your
money
back?
you
can't
do
that.
the
one
ticket
for
the
winning
horse
is
what
the
whole
thing
was
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brinkmann,
if
the
void
waiver
leaves
the
parties
where
they
were,
then
doesn't
someone
who
is
asserting
that
the
waiver
violates
the
statute
by
bringing
a
lawsuit,
doesn't
that
person
have
to
return...
in
order
to
be
consistent
in
the
pleading,
doesn't
the
person
have
to
return
whatever
money
that
person
has
acquired
under
the
contract?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
void.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
therefore,
if
you
assert
that
that
has
happened,
you
should
return
the
money
when
you
bring
the
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
otherwise
you're
being
inconsistent
with
your
theory.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't...
i
don't
even
care
about
the
common
law.
i
just
care
about
someone
who
comes
in
and
asserts
that
this
contract
is
void,
but
wants
to
keep
the
money
the
person
has
under
the
contract,
or
at
least
use
it
to
hire
the
lawyer
to
bring
the
lawsuit.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
then
if
you
lose
you
keep
the
money,
but
if
you
win,
oh,
i'll
cough
up
the
money,
but
i'll
get
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
congress...
the
statute
says
nothing
about
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
your
argument
does
not
assume
that
the
waiver
is
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
just
assumes
that
the
waiver
was
signed.
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
that
quite
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
essential
to
your
case
that
she
signed
a
piece
of
paper.
it
is
not
essential
to
your
case
that
that
waiver
be
valid.
justice
antonin
scalia
why--
--again--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips--
--but
not
under
federal
statutes
like
the
fela.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
phillips,
i
am
surprised
at
your
concession
that
if
this
contract
is
void
the
employee
can
keep
all
the
money
that
he
received.
you
say
that
that's
the
common
law
rule?
i
know
that
contracts
that
are
void
for
reasons
of
public
policy--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
i
hire
you
to
murder
someone
and
give
you
money,
i
can't
get
my
money
back,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--if
i
pay
you
to
fix
prices
or
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
where
a
contract
is
void
because
the
deal
between
the
people
is
not...
for
example,
void
for
want
of
consideration.
i
give
you
money,
and
you've
made
an
illusory
promise
in
exchange.
can
i
get...
that's
a
void
con--
justice
antonin
scalia
--can
i
not
get
my
money
back?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
let
me
put
it
to
you
squarely.
do
you...
are
you
concerned
about
the
things
that
justice
breyer
is
concerned
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
can't
say
that
a
void
contract
leaves
everybody
where
they
are.
it
depends
on
the
basis
for
the
voidness.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
every
void--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
i
used
to
teach
first-year
contract--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
he
was
not
my
teacher.
[laughter]
and
i
don't
know
what
the
rule
is
generally
about
returning
the
whole
thing
or
not,
but
i'm
sure
that
where
a
contract
contains
several
items,
and
the
value
all
of
those
items
depends
upon
future
contingencies,
you
cannot
await
for...
wait
for
one
of
those
contingencies
to
occur,
such
as
the
bringing
of
a
lawsuit,
the
discovery
of
a
claim,
and
then
say,
well,
you
take
back
all
the
rest.
give
me...
you
know,
i'll
give
you
back
only
the
money
i
paid
for
the
four
horses
that
didn't
win.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
one
horse
that
did
win,
i
only
paid
20
percent
of
the
whole
thing
for
that
ticket.
i
am
sure
that
a
court
would
not
allow
that.
i'm
not
sure
you
have
to
go
as
far
as
the
general
rule
you're
pressing
on
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
interested
in
that.
now,
what
are
you
asking...
i'm
not
sure
how
much
difference
it
makes
in
this
case,
but
just
as
a
matter
of
curiosity,
i
wasn't
clear
from
your
brief,
are
you
asking
us
to
look
to
the
law
of
a
particular
state
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
nice
to
know
what
we're
doing.
i
mean--
--may
i--
--well,
you
don't
think
that
congress
was
enacting
this
law
in
the
back...
with
the
backdrop
of
state
common
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
phillips,
to
come
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
what
if
there
were
different
rules
in
louisiana
and
new
york,
would
a
suit
in
new
york
come
out
differently?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
new
york
did
not--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no...
well,
a
proportionate
tenderback.
we'll
guess
at
some
proportion.
justice
antonin
scalia
for
different
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
new
york
had
only
adopted
that
rule
for
this
statute,
for
an
adea
case,
could
it...
could
new
york
say,
in
adea
cases,
given
the
nature
of
this
statute
and
what-not,
we're
going
to
adopt
that
rule,
although
in
all
other
cases
in
new
york
we
won't
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
maybe
we'd
get
into
a
lot
of
difficult
questions
if
we
say
this
is
governed
by
state-by-state
law.
