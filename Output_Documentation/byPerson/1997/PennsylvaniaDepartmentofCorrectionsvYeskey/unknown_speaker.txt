unknown
speaker
well,
mr.--
--mr.
tufano,
did
you
make
your
constitutional
argument
in
the
courts
below?
unknown
speaker
did
you
make
that
argument
below,
that
the
statute
should
be
construed
a
particular
way
because
to
construe
it
another
way
would
get
into
constitutional
difficulties?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tufano,
the
language
of
the
statute
says
that
public
entity
means
any
state
or
local
government,
any
department,
agency,
district
or
other
instrumentality
of
a
state
or
states
or
local
government.
that's
very
broad
language,
is
it
not?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
about
the
application
of
the
ada...
disabilities
act...
to
employees
of
prisons?
does
it
apply
there?
unknown
speaker
how
about
to
visitors
at
prisons?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
what,
in
the
language
that
i
read,
gets
you
off
the
hook
for
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
prison
might
not
itself
be
a
program,
but
it
might
have
within
the
prison
context
a
program
or
activity.
in
this
very
case
it's
alleged
that
the
particular
program,
the
boot
camp,
is
a
sort
of
program
or
activity
of
the
prison.
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
an
argument
that
in
complying
with
the
statute
and
the
regulations,
that
the
prison
only
has
to
make
reasonable
modifications
based
on
the
circumstances.
now,
surely
the
circumstance
that
it's
a
prison
and
there
are
great
security
concerns
would
affect
that
determination,
would
it
not?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tufano,
which
civil
rights
act
did
you
say?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is
of
the
same
genre,
i
believe,
as
title
vi,
which,
as
you
know,
covers
race
discrimination,
and
i
think
the
language
is
almost
identical,
so
would
you
say,
then,
on
your
reasoning
about
prisoners,
that
title
vi
would
not
apply
either
to
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
who
is
they?
was
this
report
approved
by
the
whole
congress?
who
is
it
a
report
of?
unknown
speaker
and
you
want
to
attribute
that
to
the
whole
congress?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
the
background
of
the
rehabilitation
act,
which
has
been
on
the
books
since
the
seventies,
and
as
i
understand
it,
the
ada
is
modeled
precisely
on
that,
and
there
is
some
20
years
of
department
of
justice
regulations
saying
that
prisons
are
covered.
unknown
speaker
what
does
appear
in
the
four
corners
of
the
document
that
enables
you
to
exclude
prisons?
what
language
do
you
rely
upon
that
excludes...
it
doesn't
really
exclude
prisons
entirely,
just
excludes
those
programs
in
prisons
that
relate
to
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
so
any
area
that
is
not
mentioned
in
the
finding
is
not
covered
by
the
text
of
the
act,
even
though
the
words
otherwise
would
cover
it.
is
that
the
principle
you
want
us
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
may
i
go
back
to
the
findings
for
a
minute?
what
is
it
in
the
findings
that
excludes
prisons?
it
starts
out,
some
43
million
americans
have
one
or
more
physical
or
mental
disability.
are
you
saying
that's
43
million
not
counting
prisoners?
unknown
speaker
such
areas
as.
institutionalization
is
also
in
there.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is
an
institution.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
just
staying
within
the
four
corners
of
the
document
is
what
we
started
to
do.
i
would
have
thought
institutionalization
includes
being
institutionalized
in
a
prison
or
a
mental
institution
or
whatever
kind
of
institution,
just
without
knowing
the
background
of
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
a
matter
of
getting
into
prison,
but
once
you're
in
prison,
the
eligibility
requirements
to
use
the
prison
exercise
facilities,
right?
i
guess
not
everybody's
allowed
to
use
them.
i
suppose
the
guards
can't
use
them.
aren't
there
eligibility
requirements
for
various
activities
in
the
prison?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
you
don't...
the
word
public,
i
take
it,
you
don't
have
a
textual
argument
on
that.
the
word
public
is
not
defined
anywhere
so
as
to
say
it
means
free
people
rather
than
incarcerated
people,
so
you...
am
i
correct?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
public
apparently
means,
i
assume
from
the
act,
any
person
in
relation
to
the
government.
wouldn't
that
be
the
normal
significance
of
the
term?
if
government
is
being
bound,
public
is
that
which
is
not
government,
so
public
i
presume
would
include
prisoners.
unknown
speaker
it
is
very
different,
but
is
it
defined
in
the
ada
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
you
said
not
all
prison
programs
are
for
the
benefit
of
the
prisoner,
but
the
very
one
we
have
before
us
surely
is,
this
boot
camp
that
allows
a
prisoner
to
save
many,
many
months
of
incarceration,
isn't
that
right?
wouldn't
you
call
that
for
the
benefit
of
the
prisoner?
unknown
speaker
what
about
mental,
state
mental
institutions?
are
they
public
institutions?
are
the
residents
of
mental
institutions
members
of
the
public?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
different
from
prisons?
i
don't
understand
that.
i
mean,
they're
certainly
separated
from
the
public
just
as
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
all
very
true,
but
how
does
that
bear
upon
the
word
public?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
any
element
of
voluntary,
or
you
know,
having
committed
criminal
acts
in...
there's
just
nothing
in
the
word
public
that
makes
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
they've
given...
they're
certainly
deprived
of
rights.
unknown
speaker
the
basic
right
to
walk
out
of
the
institution.
unknown
speaker
that's
all
very
true,
but
how
do
you
read
that
into
the
word
public?
i--
unknown
speaker
--you
have
to
give
me
a
text
to...
as
the
doorway
to
what
you
want
to
achieve.
i
don't
see
a
single
word
in
the
act
that
has
any
of
these
notions.
they
may
make
a
lot
of
sense.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
do
you
think
that
this
court
would
sanction
a
prison
policy
that
said
black
prisoners
can't
eat
in
the
dining
hall
with
white
prisoners
because
they
don't
have
any
constitutional
rights?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
so,
either,
and
if
congress
were
enacting
legislation
based
on
its
perception
that
handicapped
people
suffer
from
discriminatory
attitudes
and
practices,
then
congress
might
think
that
that
should
be
stopped,
just
like
the
thing
i
just
asked
you
about.
i
think
that's
possible.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
normally
apply
what?
we
don't
have
an
as-applied
challenge
here
in--
unknown
speaker
--the
context
that
you
are
concerned
about,
i
think,
and
as
i
suggested
before
it's
quite
possible
that
concerns
for
prison
security
would
be
relevant
in
deciding
what
specific
action
a
prison
has
to
take
with
regard
to
a
specific
handicapped
prisoner.
unknown
speaker
what
sort
of
things
practically,
mr.
tufano,
do
you
envision
happening
if
the
third
circuit
opinion
is
upheld,
or
what
sort
of
things
are
the
prison
administrators
going
to
be
confronted
with?
unknown
speaker
release
his
what?
unknown
speaker
oh,
t-i-c-s.
unknown
speaker
okay.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
still
don't
understand
the
expression,
to
release
the
tics,
but--
[laughter]
--if
it
satisfies
the
chief
justice--
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
different
than
under
title
vi,
with
race
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
any
different...
congress
has
said,
here's
a
class,
and
thou
shalt
not
discriminate,
but
we
recognize
the
need
for
reasonable
regulations.
congress
says,
thou
shalt
not
discriminate
in
prisons,
you've
conceded,
even
though
they
didn't
use
the
word
prisons,
on
the
basis
of
race,
and
apparently
the
prison
authorities
are
able
to
cope
with
that.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
mr.
tufano,
the
federal
regulations
dealing
with
the
application
of
this
act
say
things
such
as
the
following:
a
public
entity
shall
make
reasonable
modifications
in
policies,
practices,
or
procedures
where
necessary
to
avoid
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
disability,
and
unless
the
entity
can
demonstrate
that
making
the
modifications
would
fundamentally
alter
the
nature
of
the
service,
program
or
activity.
now,
that
seems
on
its
face
to
leave
room
for
prisons
to
say,
it's
not
a
reasonable
modification
that's
being
sought,
and
it
would
alter
the
program
or
activity
that's
necessary
in
the
prison
context.
unknown
speaker
mr.
tufano,
what
responsibility
does
the
justice
department
have
for
the
administration
of
this
law?
does
it
have
any
responsibility,
other
than
issuing
regulations
interpreting
the
law?
unknown
speaker
does
it
do
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
what
is
that?
complaints
are
made
to
them?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
they
do
when
complaints
are
made
to
them?
they
bring
suit?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
the
same
with
any
criminal
law,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
we
usually
don't
let
the
justice
department
say
what
our
criminal
laws
mean
by
issuing
regulations
interpreting
those
criminal
laws.
so
why...
why
is
that?
what's
your
problem,
and
i'm
not
saying
you
don't
have
one,
because
i
hear
this
kind
of
problem
quite
a
lot.
what
justice
o'connor
said,
i
thought
was
the
case.
the
law
requires
reasonable
accommodation,
and
so
you
produce
examples
where
it
seems
they're
requiring
unreasonable
accommodation,
so
why
don't
you
say
to
the
court
or
whoever,
reasonable
is
what
it
requires,
what
we're
doing
is
reasonable,
and
if
you're
right,
you
can
do
it,
and
if
you're
wrong,
you
shouldn't
do
it?
i'm
not
saying
it's
that
simple,
but
i
want
to
know
what
the
problem
is.
unknown
speaker
but
now
you're
getting--
--i'm
not...
that
isn't
my
question.
my
question
is,
is
there
any
practical
problem
in
applying
it
to
prisons
that
wouldn't
exist
in
any
other
institution
in
society?
of
course
people
can
disagree
about
what's
reasonable,
but
ultimately,
if
you're
reasonable
you
should
be
permitted
to
do
it
and
if
you're
not
reasonable
you
shouldn't
be.
is
there
some
kind
of
special
problem?
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
they
should
be
able
to
be
unreasonable
but
nobody
else
should?
unknown
speaker
they'll
have
to
treat
them
reasonably,
in
light
of
their
disability.
are
you
arguing
that
they
should
be
able
to
treat
them
unreasonably?
i
mean,
i'm
getting
to
the
same
point
over
and
over,
but
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
is
your
real
problem
here.
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
anyone
make
this
argument
to
congress?
unknown
speaker
but
since
the
position
has
been
taken
by
some
courts,
by
the
department
of
justice,
that
first
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
now
under
the
disabilities
act,
prisons
are
covered,
have
any
states,
pennsylvania
or
any
others,
said
to
congress
please
amend
this
statute?
whatever
you
meant,
please
amend
it
so
that
we
don't
have
this
litigation.
unknown
speaker
are
you
making
the
argument
that
even
though
congress
says
all
and
any,
prisons
are
out,
unless
congress
specifically
mentions
prisons,
even
though
all
or
any
will
cover
any
other
kind
of
institution?
unknown
speaker
but
they
didn't
put
in
anything...
they
used
all,
as
justice
o'connor
said.
they
used
any.
they
used
sweepingly
encompassing,
inclusive
language,
and
you're
saying
they
have
to
single
out
prisons,
i
take
it--
unknown
speaker
--as
apart
from
all
other
institutions.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
tufano.
mr.
specter,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
specter,
one
question
just
to
straighten
me
out.
does
the
statute
apply
to
federal
prisons?
unknown
speaker
under
504?
unknown
speaker
does
the
rehab
act
apply
to
federal
prisons?
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
it's
basically
the
same
provision?
unknown
speaker
what
is
section
504?
unknown
speaker
oh,
the
rehabilitation
act.
unknown
speaker
the
rehabilitation
act
covers
federal
facilities
and...
which
came
first,
the
rehabilitation
act?
unknown
speaker
which
covers
only
federally
funded
programs
in
the
federal
government,
and
then
the
ada
essentially
extended
the
same
thing
more
generally
to
all
state
and
public
institutions.
unknown
speaker
what's
been
the
history
of
litigation
from
prisoners
in
the
federal
system
under
the
rehab
act?
unknown
speaker
is
the
federal
government
liable
for
punitive
damages
in
the
event
of
default?
unknown
speaker
so
that's
the
big
difference.
there'll
be
a
big
damages
component
under
the
ada.
unknown
speaker
well,
punitive--
--maybe
huge.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
attorney's
fees
recoverable?
unknown
speaker
under
ada.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
there
a
federal
enforcement
arm
under
the
justice
department
or
not?
unknown
speaker
is
that
by
statute?
unknown
speaker
by
provisions
of
the
ada?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
think
that
they
drastically
limit
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
some
lawyer
thought
there
was
the
potential
for
attorney's
fees
and
punitive
damages
in
a
case,
i
assume
the
attorney
would
pay
filing
fees.
unknown
speaker
supposing,
mr.
specter,
that
a
criminal
defendant
in
pennsylvania
has
just
been
convicted
and
he's
going
to
be
in
prison
for
a
long
period
of
time,
and
the
judge
sentences
him
to
a
regular
prison,
can
he
make
an
argument
that,
you
know,
i've
got
a
heart
condition
and
therefore
i
should
go
to
a
special...
to
a
more
lenient
prison
for
that
reason?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
somebody
who
uses
a
wheelchair.
supposing
he
says,
you
know,
i
had
a
heart
attack
6
years
ago,
i
just
should
get
special
consideration,
and
the
regime
in
the
prison
you're
going
to
send
me
to
is
just
too
rigorous.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
without
benefit
of
the
ada?
unknown
speaker
the
ada
only
requires
reasonable
accommodation,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
and
what
would
constitute
reasonable
accommodation
in
a
prison
is
not
necessarily
the
same
thing
that
would
constitute
reasonable
accommodation
in
some
other
public
facility,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
and
in
this
case
we
didn't
get
into
any
of
that.
he
made
a
claim,
but
there's
nothing
exploring
whether
he
has
any
right
to
be
in
this
boot
camp,
is
that
so?
unknown
speaker
now,
what
if
the
medical
condition
is
such
that
the
prison
says,
if
you
participate
in
the
boot
camp
program--
unknown
speaker
--it
will
be
a
severe
hazard
to
your
health?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
a
serious
risk
to
you
to
engage
in
this
program
in
any
meaningful
way.
unknown
speaker
and
they're
not
a
qualified
individual,
i
assume--
unknown
speaker
--under
the
statute.
they
just
don't
qualify.
unknown
speaker
and
you
share,
i
take
it,
my
concern
that
the
requirements
of
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
in
light
of
the
prison
need
for
security.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
prison
official
said,
this
person
can
really
participate
in
only
about
half
of
our
program.
he
can
do
a
half
a
day
of
the
strenuous
running,
getting
up
early,
marching,
and
calisthenics
and
so
forth.
he
can
do
this
for
half
a
day
but
not
a
full
day,
and
we
think
that
the
program
really
operates
best
with
a
full
day.
and
it's
just
a
matter
of
money,
and
they
could
have
a
program
so
that...
say,
if
three
or
four
prisoners
could
do
the
half-day
program,
it
might
work,
it
might
not
work.
we're
not
sure
how
well
boot
camp
programs
work.
that's
about
the
evidence.
what
would
the
district
judge
do
with
a
case
like
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
use
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
use
my
hypothetical.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
could
have
a
twotrack
program,
for
some
people
do
it
half-a-day,
some
people
do
it
a
full
day,
would
they
have
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
how
does
that
work
in
the
statute?
that
is,
one
of
the
things
that
was
worrying
me
is
that
in
section
12131(2)
it
uses...
you
know,
that's
the
one
that
says...
defines
qualified
individual
with
a
disability.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
uses
the
word
reasonable
in
respect
to
modification
to
rules,
policies,
or
practices,
and
then
when
you
get
to
the
provision
of
auxiliary
aids
and
services
the
word
reasonable
doesn't
easily
fit
there,
but
it
wouldn't
make
sense
not
to
have
it
fit,
so
how...
and
it
similarly
wouldn't
make...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
the
statute
intends
to
make
people
do
things
that
are
not
reasonable.
unknown
speaker
so
how
is
that
worked
out
in
the
interpretation?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
isn't
a...
is
auxiliary
service
like
an
extra
boot
camp?
i
mean,
suppose
somebody
said--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
but
suppose
the
person
argues,
in
my
case
what
it
requires
is
the
following,
because
of
the
boot
camp
something
costs
$1
billion.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--which
would
be
totally
unreasonable.
i'm
looking
for
something
that's
totally
unreasonable
and
then
asking
you
how
does
that
work.
unknown
speaker
how
does
the
word
reasonable
come
into
it?
unknown
speaker
and
is
that
true
also
of
architectural
barriers?
unknown
speaker
even
if
it
costs
$10
billion
to
build
a
one-room
shack.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
if
it
did.
[laughter]
my
question
is,
is
reasonableness
there
coming
into
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
sure.
unknown
speaker
mr.
specter,
the
reasonable
accommodation
standard
crops
up
in
various
places
in
the
law,
and
one
is
in
title
vii
in
reasonable
accommodation
to
religious
practices.
unknown
speaker
are
there
other
examples
that
one
would
look
to
if
we
want
to
understand
this
concept
of
reasonableness
and
how
it
relates
to
expense?
unknown
speaker
mr.
tufano
told
us
what
he's
concerned
about
is
turning
all
these
matters
into
federal
cases.
unknown
speaker
mr.
specter--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
agree
with
mr.
tufano
that
the
state
did
not
raise
any
constitutional
argument
in
the
lower
courts?
unknown
speaker
just
one
question.
the
cases
of
ramps
and
some
of
the
fixtures
are
fairly
easy
and
straightforward
cases,
but
we
both
know
that
in
the
employment
context
there's
such
a
thing...
reasonable
accommodation
includes
reassignment.
it
also
includes
redesigning
of
jobs.
now,
would
you
see...
seek
in
this
case
a
redesigning
of
the
boot
camp
to
accommodate
a...
an
individual
who
is
disabled
in
some
way?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
was
necessary.
unknown
speaker
sort
of
on
the
scale
of
light
duty
in
the
post
office
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and...
i
understand
that,
but
that's...
we
both
know
that
that's
tough.
the...
you
can
redesign
jobs
that
fundamentally
do
the
same
thing,
but
with
half
the
efficiency,
so
we
know
there's
a
problem
there.
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
even
though
the
accommodation
may
be
different
or
reasonableness
may
take
on
a
different
meaning
in
the
remedial
context,
the
definition,
very
personalized
definition
of
what
is
a
disability,
let's
say
someone
has
a
disability,
of
course,
of
a
psychological
nature.
that
would
have
to
be
accommodated
in
prison,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
it's
in
pennsylvania
in
the
employment
context
some...
you
can
prove,
this
individual
can
prove
that
claustrophobia
is
my
disability,
and
let's
say
this
person
has
a
history
of
claustrophobia
as
a
disability,
and
the...
as
soon
as
he's
sentenced
by
the
judge
he
says,
i
have
claustrophobia.
now,
how
do
you
accommodate
that?
unknown
speaker
but
we
both
know
it's
a
little
bit
more...
reasonable
accommodation
is
a
bit
more
difficult
than
our
discussion's
been
so
far.
unknown
speaker
but
we
know
under
504
it's
pretty
difficult.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--did
congress
give
the
task
to
district
courts
or
to
prison
administrators?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
specter.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gornstein.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i'm
very
interested,
mr.
gornstein,
if
it
does
apply,
how
you
interpret
the
accommodation
that's
required
in
the
prison
context.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gornstein,
how
much
litigation
has
there
been
on
the
section
504,
because
that's
been
around
for
a
couple
of
decades,
involving
prisons,
either
federal
prisons
or
state
prisons
receiving
federal
assistance?
unknown
speaker
are
damages
available
under
the
rehab
act?
unknown
speaker
right,
so
that
might
indicate
why
there's
less
litigation,
and
no
punitive
damages.
unknown
speaker
but
under...
and
that
would
cover
the
ada--
unknown
speaker
--as
well?
unknown
speaker
tell
us
a
little
bit
more
about
how
the
boot
camp
might
work.
let's
suppose
that
a
high
school
had
a
physical
conditioning
program,
very
rigorous,
for
its
students
2
or
3
hours
a
day,
and
that
a
disabled
student
wanted
to
participate,
and
it
would
cost
$5,000
a
year
per
disabled
student
increase
to
run
a
separate
track
program
for
the
disabled
student.
the
same
with
the
boot
camp.
a
disabled
prisoner
wants
to
participate
in
boot
camp.
it
would
cost
$5,000
a
year
for
the
second
track
for
the
disabled
prisoner.
would
the
judge
make
the
same
determination
in
each
case,
or
would
he
say,
prison
budgets
are
such
that
$5,000
is
more
significant
for
a
prison
than
it
is
for
schools?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
in
each
case
you
can
do
it
for
$5,000,
second
track,
a
second
track
for
the
school
$5,000,
second
track
for
the
prisoners.
unknown
speaker
is
the
calculus
just
the
same?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
you
in
the
boot
camp
hypothetical,
if
it's
feasible
to
do
for
$5,000
a
prisoner,
or
$5,000
a
student?
unknown
speaker
$5,000.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that
we
think
it
might
work
if
it's
altered
for
this
person.
we're
not
sure,
but
we're
pretty
sure
it
will
work.
it
won't
be
as
good,
but
it
will
certainly
have
some
benefits.
the
same
with
the
high
school.
unknown
speaker
through
the
regulations,
or
through
the
statute?
that
doesn't...
i
thought
the
statute
was
clear
enough.
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--it's
as
clear
as
this
one,
you
say.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
disagree
with
that.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
tufano,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
