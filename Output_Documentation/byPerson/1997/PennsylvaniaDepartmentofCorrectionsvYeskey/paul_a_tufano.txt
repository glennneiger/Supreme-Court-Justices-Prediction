mr.
paul
a.
tufano
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
applying
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
to
state
prisoners
goes
against
the
intent
of
congress
and
violates
the
constitution.
it
also
allows
congress
to
alter
the
federal-state
balance
of
power
without
first
giving
states
notice
and
then
opportunity
to
be
heard,
and
it
ignores
this
court's
clear
mandate
that
state
prison
administrators
who
have
difficult
and
dangerous
jobs
be
given
great
deference.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
your
honor,
we
did
make
constitutional
arguments
in
that
we
have
always
argued
in
this
case
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
federalism
issues,
and
the
issue
of
the
clear
statement
rule,
and
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
we
believe
that
the
court
is
to
be
guided
by
possible
serious
and
grave
constitutional
questions
which
could
arise
from
an
interpretation
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
as
applying
to
prisoners.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
we
did
not,
your
honor.
we
argued
below,
as
we
have
always,
the
issues
of
federalism
and
the
same
arguments
that
we've
raised
below
regarding
federalism
go
to
the
arguments
which
we
have
made
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
regarding
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
commerce
clause
as
well.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
we
would
take
the
position
that
it
does
apply
to
visitors,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
we
don't
dispute
the
fact
that
the
department
of
corrections
is
a
public
entity
within
the
meaning
of
the
ada
and
in
title
ii,
but
there
is
a
difference
between
the
department
of
corrections
being
considered
a
public
entity
and
whether
a
prison
is
a
public
entity
or
a
program,
activity,
or
service.
when
the
department
of
corrections
wears
its--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--we
believe,
your
honor,
that
program,
activity,
and
service
have
different
meanings
in
the
context
of
a
prison,
that
it
is
not
the...
it
was
not
the
intent
of
congress
to
cover
something
like
prisoners,
that
prisoners
are
not
part
of
the
public,
and
that--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--it
would
affect
it,
your
honor,
but
again,
you
have
to
look
at
the
fact
that
congress'
findings
in
enacting
the
ada
talked
about
employment,
housing,
voting,
medical
services,
and
it
talked
about
access
to
public
services,
and
it
talked
about
people
having...
being
able
to
live
independently,
and
they
talked
about
living
in
a
free
society,
and
the
fact
that
they
based
their
findings
in
large
part
on
the
u.s.
commission
on
civil
rights
report
of
1983,
which
they
lifted
the
conclusions
almost
verbatim,
except
for
one,
on
involuntary
sterilization,
and
they
chose
a
couple
of
more
which
were
not
in
the
conclusions--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--the
u.s.
commission
on
civil
rights
report
of
1983,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
congress
specifically
chose
two
or
three
findings,
or
list
of
areas
in
the
appendix
to
this
report
which
did
not
discuss
them
as
areas
where
discriminatory
practices
occur,
and
they
specifically
left
behind
the
criminal
justice
system,
where--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--it
was
a
report
of
the
u.s.
commission
on
civil
rights,
and
it
was,
i
believe,
introduced
into
both
committees
of
congress,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
well,
justice
o'connor's
question
about
public
entity,
and
whether
a
prison
is
a
program,
statutory
construction,
as
this
court
has
held,
is
a
holistic
endeavor,
and
you
look
not
only
at
individual
sentences,
but
you
also
look
at
the
whole
purpose
of
the
law,
and
the
purpose
of
the
ada
was
to
provide
for
the
assimilation
in
free
society
of
american
citizens
in
employment--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--in...
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in...
the
rehab
act
regulations
which
were
promulgated
by
the
justice
department
referred
to
prisons,
and
in
1990,
when
congress
enacted
the
ada,
and
the
states
were
to
supposed
to
have
been
given
a
clear
statement
that
the
historic
sovereign
function
of
state
prison
management
was
about
to
be
entered
into
by
the
congress,
the...
what
congress
was
aware
of
at
best
was
rehabilitation
act
regulations
promulgated
by
the
agency,
nothing
in
the
act,
and
there
were...
there
was
a
circuit
court
decision
and
two
district
court
decisions,
and
in
the
ada,
it
refers
back
to
parts
of
the
rehab
act
regulations,
part
39
and
part
41.
part
41
doesn't
say
anything
about
prisons,
and
the
respondent
and
the
federal
government
argue
that
the
states
were
to
know
that
in
part
42
there
is
mention
about
prisons.
part
39
talks
about
the
justice
department
and
federal
prisons
very
much
into
the
fine
print,
and
that's
what's
wrong
with
the
ada.
the
ada...
the
argument
of
the
respondent
in
the
federal
government
as
to
what
the
clear
statement
was
in
the
ada
is
to
read
the
fine
print.
the
problem
is
that
the
fine
print
is
in
another
set
of
regulations
under
a
different
law,
and
it
does
not
appear
in
the
four
corners
of
the
document,
and
it's
our
position
that--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--you
start
with
the
findings,
your
honor,
by
congress,
in
the
findings
section
of
the
ada,
where
they
talk
about
the
different
areas
where
they
have
found
problems
with
discrimination
and
the...
they
don't
talk
about
the
criminal--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--well,
that's
part
of
the
principle
i'd
want
you
to
apply.
the
other
part
would
to
be...
to
look
at
the
meanings
of
the
words
in
the
statute
regarding
a
qualified
individual
who
meets
the
essential
eligibility
requirement.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
yes,
i
am,
your
honor,
because
if
you
look
below
that
they
talk
about
discrimination
in
such
areas
as
employment,
housing,
public
accommodations,
education,
transportation,
communication,
and
recreation.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
institutionalization
is
there,
but
again--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--it's
a
correctional
institution,
but--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--we
believe
that
the
meaning
of
institutionalization,
which
again
these
areas
were
lifted,
that
that
sentence
in
12101(a)(3)
is
almost
verbatim
language
from
the
u.s.
commission
report,
where
institutionalization
is
not
discussed
in
the
criminal
justice
context.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
i
understand,
your
honor,
but
again,
if
you
look
at
the
language
in
the
ada
which
talks
about
qualified
individuals
who
meet
essential
eligibility
requirements...
and
it's
in
the
context
of
title
ii,
which
is
about
public
services,
and
i
don't
think
that
you
can
reasonably
conclude
that
meeting
the
eligibility
requirements
to
receive
food
stamps,
or
to
get
into
a
library
or
a
museum,
is
the
same
as
meeting
the
eligibility
requirements
to
get
into
prison.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
there
are
eligibility
requirements
within
a
prison,
but
the
difference
is
that
public
services
are
provided
to
the
public
for
their
benefit,
and
not
all
of
the
programs
and
activities
and
services
of
a
prison
are
primarily
for
the
benefit
of
the
prisoner.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
that's
correct
that
that's
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
well,
the
public
in
the
context
of
the
ada,
which
talks
about
assimilation
of
people
immediately
into
free
society,
is
very
different
from
what
happens
with
prisoners,
where
we
take
them
out
of
society.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
the
word
public
is
not
defined
anywhere,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
certainly
there's
a
incidental
benefit
for
the
prisoner,
but
if
you
look
at
the
boot
camp
act,
the
general
assembly
in
pennsylvania
was
seeking
to
deal
with
the
problem
of
overcrowding
in
prison,
and
to
deal
with
the
problems
of
riots
in
prison,
and
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
it
was
not
to
give
inmates
an
early
way
out
of
prison.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
yes,
they
are,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
but
in
mental
institutions,
your
honor,
they're
there
because
they
need
help,
because
they
can't
make
decisions
for
themselves,
and
in
many
cases
the
court
makes--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--because--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--i
think
that
a
couple
of
differences.
one,
that
public
does
not
imply
someone
who,
when
they
go
through
a
prison
gate,
gives
up
or
has
curtailed
many
of
their
rights,
unlike
somebody
who
is
in
a
mental
institution
who
is
there
at
times
against
their
will
because
they
can't...
they
don't
have
the
capacity
to
make
a
decision
for
themselves.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
they
are,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--they
are,
but
they're
there
for
their
own
help.
they're
there
for
their
benefit,
and
a
prisoner
is
not
in
prison
for
his
or
her
benefit.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
i--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--again,
looking
at
what
the
goals
of
congress
were
in
implementing
the
ada
and
what
they
talked
about,
the
different
areas
that
there,
had
problems
with,
knowing
that
for
25
years
and
more
this
court
has
consistently
talked
about
the
problems
unique
to
prison
management
and
have
not
applied
the
same
constitutional
analysis
to
prisoners,
so
i
believe
that
when
you
look
at
the
way
prisoners
are
treated
in
the
eyes
of
the
constitution,
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--i
don't
think
this
court
would
sanction
it.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
it's
possible,
your
honor,
but
again,
what
congress
has
done
in...
if
they
have
tried
to
apply
the
ada
to
state
prisons,
what
they've
done
is
applied
a
different
standard
now
to
how
prison
management
have
to
deal
with
the
disabled,
and
in
your
example
of
blacks
in
the
cafeteria,
this
court
has
held
that
the
normal
strict
scrutiny
analysis
doesn't
apply
in
the
prison
context
when
fundamental
rights
or
a
suspect
class
are
involved.
you
look
at
whether
it's
reasonably
related
to
a
legitimate
penalogical
interest,
and
with
the
disabled,
this
court
has
held
that
they're
not
a
suspect
class,
and
that
with
prisoners,
even
in
the
most
strictest
of
scrutiny
situations,
you
wouldn't
normally
apply
that,
so
now
we
have--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--i
understand.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
again,
your
honor,
the
problem
is
that
applying
the
ada
in
title
ii
to
state
prisoners
will
shift
the
burden.
currently,
the
actions
or
policies
of
a
department
of
corrections
are
presumed
to
be
valid.
under
the
ada,
the
standard
will
be
that
prison
administrators
with...
only
with
regard
to
the
disabled
will
have
to
show
that
there
weren't
any
other
means
by
which
they
could
have
accommodated
this
person,
that
any
other...
this
was
the
only
way--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--well,
one
of
the
things,
and
we
cite
it
in
our
brief,
your
honor,
is
in
the
purcell
case,
where
an
inmate
was
told
that
he
had
a
doctor's
appointment,
and
he
refused
to
go
to
the
doctor's
appointment
because
he
wanted
to
go
into
a
cell
and
release
his
tics
because
he
had
tourette's
syndrome.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
his
tics,
his...
the
emotional
outbursts
which
are--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--yes.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
a
different
kind
of
tics.
he
told
the
guard
that--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--but
in
that
case...
in
that
case,
a
simple
situation
where
an
inmate
is
telling
a
corrections
guard,
i
don't
have
to
go
to
my
medical
appointment,
and
he
was
given
the
opportunity
to
sign
a
release
if
he
didn't
go
to
the
appointment.
he
didn't
want
to
do
either
because,
i
have
tourette's
syndrome
and
i'm
allowed
to
go
into
my
cell
and
release
my
tics
at
my
leisure.
now
we're
facing
in
that
case
the
possibility
of
punitive
damages
for
the
guards
telling
the
inmate
either
go
to
your
doctor's
appointment...
he
wasn't
sending
him
to
the
rock
pile.
he
was
sending
him
to
his
medical
appointment...
or
sign
this
release
that
you
refuse
to
go
to
your
medical
appointment,
and
he
said
no,
i
don't
have
to
do
that,
and
we
were
not
able
to
get
the
court
in
that
case
to
agree
with
us
that
that
did
not
state
a
claim
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
and
the
problem
is,
in
a
prison
environment,
where
you
have
murderers,
rapists,
the
worst
people
in
society,
if
the
disabled
are
going
to
be
able
to
put
a
guard
on
his
defensive,
that
he's
now
got
to
think
unlike
he
has
to
think
with
regard
to
any
other
type
of
inmate,
but
just
with
the
disabled,
that
he
has
to
start
thinking
almost
from
a
litigation
avoidance
perspective
about
whether
if
he's
going
to
be
sued
under
the
ada,
the
institution's
going
to
get
dragged
into
court,
and--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
the
difference
is,
your
honor,
it's
one
thing
to
say,
thou
shalt
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
it's
another
thing,
in
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
to
say
you
shall
not
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
disability
in
a
program
activity
or
service
and
you
shall
affirmatively
make
accommodations
for
this
person,
and
you
shall
only
pick
your
course
of
action
if
you
can
show
that
there
wasn't
anything
else
available
according
to
what
the
inmate
wanted.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
it
might
at
first
glance,
your
honor,
but
a
couple
of
points.
one
is
that
that
is
a
standard
which
prison
officials
do
not
have
to
apply
with
regard
to
any
other
inmate,
including
inmates
that
would
be
in
a
suspect
class.
the
other
is
that
if
you
look
at
the
regulations
it
talks
about
the
head
of
the
agency
or
his
or
her
designee
having
to
put
in
writing
the
fact
that
there
were
no
other
ways
of
doing
this
without
fundamentally
altering
the
program.
and
recently
some
corrections
officials
asked
the
justice
department
to
exempt
certain
types
of
programs,
including
boot
camps,
because
clearly,
to
be
in
a
boot
camp,
given
the
physical
regimen
there
would
be...
they
talked
about
boot
camps,
and
i
believe
they
talked
about
firing
ranges.
and
the
justice
department's
response
was
to
deny
the
request
for
exemption
and
said,
only
physical
and
structural
issues
will
be
a
reason
for
an
exemption
for
that--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--i
believe
that
they--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--i
believe
that
they
have
responsibility
in
the
compliance
section,
your
honor,
with
regard
to
complaints
under
the
ada.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
they
could
be
made
to
them,
if
not
brought
into
court.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
they
can,
is
my
understanding,
but
again--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--well,
it's
not
the
same
with
any
criminal
law,
and
that's
part
of
our
concern
about
the
ada,
your
honor,
is
that--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--the
problem
is,
your
honor,
in
attempting
to
do
that
under
either
the
section
5
enforcement
powers
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
or
under
the
commerce
clause,
there's
no
basis
to
do
that
to
lift
the
standard
above
which
this
court
has
held.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
well,
the
special
problem
is
the
unique
situation
of
prisons.
i
mean--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--they
should
be
able
to,
as
they
have
with
issues
of
people's
first
amendment
rights,
whether
it's
the
free
exercise
of
religion
or
freedom
of
speech,
they
should
be
able
to
at
least
be
able
to
treat
the
disabled
under...
at
a
minimum
under
the
same
standard
or
the
way
they've
had
to
treat
other
classes
of
inmates
who,
like
the
disabled,
are
not
in
a
suspect
class,
and
the
fact
that
they're
now
going
to
have
to
treat
prisoners
who
are
disabled
different--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--the
real
problem
is
having
the
federal
government
involved
in
state
prison
management.
that's
the
basic
problem,
having
to
have...
for
the
first
time
treating
disabled
inmates
different
from
everyone
else,
knowing,
as
this
court
has
held,
that
preferential
treatment
for
inmates
poses
security
problems
in
a
prison.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
well,
because
i
believe
that...
congress
i
don't
believe
made
a
clear
statement
in
the
ada.
in
over
70
hearings
and
public
forums
in
50
states
we
have
not
been
able
to
find
one
instance
where
a
state
correctional
officer
or
official
testified,
or
provided
any
written
testimony
or
comments.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
i'm
not
aware,
your
honor,
of
anyone
after
the
fact
doing
that,
but
again,
to
rely
on
the
ada
regulations,
and
to
allow
this
fine
print
in
other
regulations
under
another
law
become
the
clear
statement,
goes
from
where
the
states
are
supposed
to
have
notice
and
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
congress
before
the
law
is
enacted
as
opposed
to--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--i
do
believe
that
when
it
comes
to
prison
management,
which
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
our
sovereignty,
that
congress
could
have
spoken
a
lot
more
clearly.
they
could
have
put
the
word
prisons
or
correctional
facilities
in
their
findings
of
areas
where
discrimination
persists.
they
might
have--
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
a.
tufano
your
honor,
i
have
no
further
rebuttal.
