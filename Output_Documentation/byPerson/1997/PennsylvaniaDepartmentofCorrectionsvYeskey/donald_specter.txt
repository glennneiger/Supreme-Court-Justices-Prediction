mr.
donald
specter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
whether
the
ada
applies
to
state
prisoners
is
not
a
close
question.
the
words
of
the
ada
are
clear.
the
words
are
plain,
and
they
cover
state
prisoners.
the
ada
was
enacted
for
one
overriding
purpose,
and
that
purpose
was
to
eliminate
discrimination
in
a
clear
and
comprehensive
manner
wherever
it
occurs
in
our
society,
and
that
includes
prisons.
mr.
donald
specter
yes.
it
applies
under
section
504
to
the
federal
prisons,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
it
does,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
that's
the
rehabilitation
act,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
i'm
sorry.
mr.
donald
specter
the
rehabilitation
act
came
in
1973,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
i
couldn't
have
said
it
any
more
clearly.
mr.
donald
specter
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
there
haven't
been
very
many
reported
cases
of
federal
prisoners
suing
under
the
rehabilitation
act.
i
know
the
federal
government
and
the
bureau
of
prisons
has
policies
which
prohibit
discrimination
based
on
disability.
mr.
donald
specter
i
don't
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
i
don't
know
if
big
is
the
right
word,
your
honor,
but
there
will--
mr.
donald
specter
--it
depends
on
your
perspective.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
they
are,
your
honor,
just
as
they're
recoverable--
mr.
donald
specter
--yes,
but
i
would
like
to
mention,
your
honor--
mr.
donald
specter
--the
justice
department
has
the
authority
to
enforce
the
ada.
they
have
authority
to
investigate,
to
seek
alternative
dispute
resolution
of
the
issues,
and
to
bring
lawsuits,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
that's
by
statute,
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor,
and
i
would
like
to
mention
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
the
potential
for
litigation
under
this
act,
the
provisions
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act,
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
which
would
drastically
limit
the
abilities
of
prisoners
to
sue
state
officials,
applies
to
many
of
the
provisions
of
the
act,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
they
impose
filing
fees,
they
have
certain--
mr.
donald
specter
--that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
i
can
tell
you
from
20
years
of
experience
in
prison
litigation
that
there
are
very
few
lawyers
out
there
who
are
willing
to
take
these
cases,
so...
but
your
theoretical
concern
is
a
real
one,
but
practically,
there
aren't
that
many
prison
lawyers
out
in
the
real
world.
mr.
donald
specter
i
wouldn't
call
it
more
lenient,
your
honor.
he
could
go
to
a
special
prison.
even
under
the
eighth
amendment
he
would
have
that
argument,
that,
as
you
say,
if
he's
otherwise
disabled,
such
as
he's
a
person
who
uses
a
wheelchair--
mr.
donald
specter
--if
his
heart
condition
would
substantially
limit
his...
any
major
life
activity,
then
that
would
be
an
issue
at
the
prison
he
was
being
sent
to.
then
he
could
make
that
argument.
in
the
real
world,
with
all
due
respect,
your
honor,
that
type
of
scenario
is
not
likely
to
occur
very
often.
mr.
donald
specter
because
most
prison
systems
have
medical
facilities
for
people
who
have
medical
conditions.
they
go
to
those
situations,
and
in
the
real
world...
in
prisons,
there
aren't...
if
you
have
a
heart
condition
and
you
can't
do
strenuous
exercise,
for
example,
you're
usually
classified
for
what's
called
light
duty,
in
which
you'd
be
given
a
job
sitting
at
a
desk,
or
some
such--
mr.
donald
specter
--even
without
the
benefit
of
the
ada.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
i
agree
with
that
completely,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
exactly
correct.
that
would
be
decided
upon
remand
to
the
district
court
if
the
court
affirms
the
third
circuit's
opinion.
petitioners
do
not
dispute
in
this
case
that...
at
least
in
their
brief
that
the
department
of
correct--
mr.
donald
specter
--yes.
mr.
donald
specter
if
the--
mr.
donald
specter
--if
they
can
prove
that,
your
honor,
and
they
can
prove
that
the
person's
participation
in
the
program
in
that
way
is
an
essential
requirement
of
the
program,
then
they
have
no
liability.
mr.
donald
specter
exactly.
mr.
donald
specter
that's
exactly
right.
mr.
donald
specter
i
do,
your
honor.
i...
we
have
said
in
our
brief
and
we
endorse
the
lower
court
decisions
that
have
made
that
statement,
that
prison
is
different.
the
ada
was
developed
to
be
a
very
flexible
statute.
it
was
developed
and
enacted
to
cover
a
very
wide
range
of
programs,
and
it
has
to
be
applied
when
considering
the
particular
factual
circumstance
of
that
program,
and
we
do
not
deny
that
prisons
are
different
than
many
other
programs.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
your
honor,
if
you
go
to
the
appendix
of,
the
last
page
of
the
appendix
of
our
brief,
you'll
find
the
boot
camp
schedule,
and
you'll
notice
that
the
physical
activity
covers
about
40
minutes
of--
mr.
donald
specter
--okay.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
in
that
circumstance
the
district
judge
may
very
well
conclude
that
the
physical
activity
is
an
essential
part
of
the
program
and
it
would
let
the
department
of
corrections
off
the
hook
if
there
was
no
other
way
that
they
could
reasonably
modify
the
program.
mr.
donald
specter
they
don't
have
to
operate
a
separate
program,
your
honor,
but
they
do
have
to
make
reasonable
accommodations.
for
example,
for...
well,
they
do
have
to
make
whatever
accommodations
that
the
district
court
finds
reasonable.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
it
doesn't.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
auxiliary
aids
and
services
is,
the
difference
is
because
in
auxiliary
aids
and
services
you
cannot
participate
in
a
program
without
them.
if
you're
deaf
and
you
don't
have
an
assisted--
mr.
donald
specter
--no,
no.
an
auxiliary
aid,
or
auxiliary
service
can
mean
an
assisted
listening
device,
for
example.
mr.
donald
specter
okay.
mr.
donald
specter
oh,
surely,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
the
regulations,
which
were
specifically
incorporated
into
the
statute
within
the
text
of
the
act
itself
that
were
promulgated
under
section
504
and
carried
over
to
section
(a)
have
an
undue
burden
defense,
so
when
the
prison
can
say,
this
would
be
an
undue
financial
or
administrative
burden,
they
have
a
defense
to
liability.
mr.
donald
specter
architectural
barriers
in
existing
facilities,
i
believe
it's
true.
in
new
facilities,
they
have
to
build
new
facilities
so
that
they're
accessible.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
it
doesn't.
mr.
donald
specter
i
would
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
but
i
can't
point
to
any
part
of
the
regulation,
because
this
is
not
a
structural
accessibility
case.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
i
think
the
clearest
way
to
look
to
read
what
congress
meant
about
reasonableness
in
the
ada
is
to
look
at
the
great
body
of
law
that's
developed
under
section
504,
which
has
applied
the
reasonable...
basically
the
same
regulations
that
are...
were
incorporated
into
the
ada.
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
ways
that
congress
was
being
flexible
and
sensitive
to
the
needs
of
the
state
agencies,
including
department
of
corrections,
by
using
a
word
with
which
district
court
judges
and
other
courts
are
familiar
and
know
how
to
apply
in
a
sensible
fashion,
and
i
think
that's
an
appropriate
way
to
cover
such
a
broad
range
of
activities.
mr.
donald
specter
yes,
your
honor.
well,
i
would
hope
that
that
would
not
be
necessary,
because
many
of
the
accommodations
or
reasonable
modifications
that
would
be
made
would
be
made
as
a
matter
of
course
by
prison
officials
anyway.
that's
the
first
thing.
secondly,
i
think
many
of
them
are
very
easy
to
make.
putting
up
some
grab
bars,
for
example,
is
very
inexpensive.
it's
very...
a
quick
procedure,
and
it
allows
a
person
who
doesn't
have
the
use
of
his
legs
an
easy
access
to
the
facilities,
to
toilet
facilities
or
shower
facilities
or
the
like.
many
of
these
things
are
not
very
difficult
to
accomplish.
the
petitioners
do
not
dispute
that
the
department
of
corrections
is
a
public
entity,
but
they
contend
that
it's
ambiguous
whether
the
boot
camp
is
a
service,
program,
or
activity,
and
our
contention
is
that
the
state...
i
wanted
to
clear
up
one
thing
mr.
tufano
said,
is
that...
or,
justice
ginsburg,
you
hinted
at,
is
the
state
boot
camp
statute
which
establishes
the
boot
camp,
establishes
it
and
defines
it,
describes
this
as
a
program
itself,
so
we
believe
that
it's
very
clear
that
program,
service,
or
activity
basically
covers
anything
that
a
state
agency
does.
the
words
program
and
activity
were
statutorily
defined
by
the
rehabilitation
act
to
cover
all
of
the
operations
of
a
prison,
and
those
words
were
taken
from
the
rehabilitation
act
and
put
into
the
ada
so
congress
would
ensure
that
they
would
have
the
same
meaning.
we
believe
that
the
universal
language
of
the
statute,
its
foundation
in
the
rehabilitation
act,
and
the
regulations
which
cover
prisons,
which
were
expressly
incorporated
into
the
act,
make
it
plain
that
there
is
no
statutory
exception
for
prisoners,
which
is
what
the
state
is
arguing
for.
we
do
not
believe,
and
we
don't
think
it
would
be...
we
think
it
would
be
an
impossible
burden
for
the...
for
congress
to
have
to
list
every
single
entity
which
it
wanted
to
cover.
i
don't
think
it
could
even...
it
would
be
very
difficult.
i
think
it
would
be
an
impossible
burden
for
congress
to
do
that.
mr.
donald
specter
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
emphatically,
your
honor.
since...
we
believe
that
the
case
is
clear,
that
the
language
of
the
statute
is
clear,
that
this
is
a
plain
meaning
case,
that
the
court,
because
this
case
arises
from
a
motion
to
dismiss,
that
the
court
must
assume
that
mr.
yeskey
has
been
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
of
his
disability,
and
he
should
not
be
denied
relief
because
the
disability
discrimination
that
occurred,
or
is
alleged
to
have
occurred,
occurred
in
a
prison
and
while
mr.
yeskey
was
a
prisoner.
we
believe,
for
all
the
reasons
that
i've
stated
and
those
in
our
brief,
that
the
judgment
of
the
third
circuit
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
that
might
even
not
be
necessary
in
this
case,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
specter
if
it
was
necessary
and
they
could
make
reasonable
modifications--
mr.
donald
specter
--yes,
your
honor,
with
one
major
qualification,
and
that...
two
major
qualifications,
and
that
are...
they
are
that
it
didn't
fundamentally
alter
the
essential
requirements
of
the
program
and
that
it
didn't
cause
an
undue
financial
or
administrative
burden.
mr.
donald
specter
if
it
substantially
limited
their
major
life
activities,
yes.
mr.
donald
specter
you
might
not
be
able
to.
it
might
not
be
a...
it
might
not
be
reasonable,
and
it
would
certainly
make
a
fundamental
alteration
in
the
nature
of
cells.
[laughter]
mr.
donald
specter
i
don't
think
the
task
that
congress
gave
to
district
courts
is
necessarily
easy
in
every
case,
but
i
think--
mr.
donald
specter
--yes.
mr.
donald
specter
i
think
it's
a
task--
mr.
donald
specter
--that
the
district
courts
are
up
to.
mr.
donald
specter
well,
hopefully
they...
district
courts
will
not
have
to
deal
with
this.
i
believe
that
in
the
first
instance
the
prison
administrators
are
the
ones
charged
with
being
responsible
for
making
these
decisions.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
i
will--
mr.
donald
specter
--yield
the
rest
of
my
time
to
mr.
gornstein.
