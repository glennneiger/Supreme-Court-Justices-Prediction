mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held
that
the
ada
prohibits
state
prisons
from
discriminating
against
disabled
inmates
in
their
programs,
services,
and
activities
that
they
provide
to
inmates
for
three
reasons:
first,
the
text
of
the
act
unambiguously
prohibits
such
discrimination,
second,
the
application
of
the
ada
to
prisons
was
a
logical...
state
prisons
was
a
logical
extension
of
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act's
application
to
federal
prisons
and
to
state
prisons
that
receive
federal
funding,
and
third,
the
interpretive
principles
that
are
relied
on
by
petitioner
do
not
support
the
creation
of
a
nontextually
based
exemption
to
the
act.
beginning
with
the
text,
the
act
applies
to
any
public
entity
that
provides
programs,
services,
or
activities
and,
since
the
act
defines
a
public
entity
to
include
any
agency
or
department
to
a
state,
the
state
department
of
corrections
is
clearly
covered.
nor
is
there
any
question
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
there
would
be
two
things
you
would
look
to.
first
of
all,
the
backdrop
of
section
504,
which
this
court
interpreted
in
southeastern
community
college
v.
davis
not
to
require
accommodations
that
impose
undue
burdens
and
not
to
require
accommodations
that
would
lead
to
a
fundamental
alteration
in
the
program,
which
in
that
case
included
lowering
standards
and
substantially
modifying
a
nursing
program,
and
second
of
all
you
would
look
to
a
general
principle
that
this
court
has
applied
in
section
504(2),
to
deferring
to
the
reasonable
medical
judgments
of
health
professionals.
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
in
the
prison
context
you
would
defer
to
the
reasonable
security
judgments
of
correctional
officials
in
the
context
of
an
ada
case.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
there
has
not
been
a
lot
relating
to
prisons,
very
little.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
damages
are
available
under
the
rehab
act
with
respect
to
state
prisons,
not
federally
assisted
prisons,
but
not
with
respect
to
federal
correctional--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
might,
but
the
thing
that
i
wanted
to
add
about
that
is
that
the
prison
litigation
reform
act
now
does
have
a
prison
that...
a
provision
that
relates
to
damages,
which
can
only
be
recovered
when
there
is
physical
injury.
that
is,
psychological
damages
and
damages
of
that
sort
can
only
be
recovered
when
there
is
physical
injury
under
the
prison
litigation
reform
act.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
would.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
would.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
the
real
difference
would
not
come
in
in
measuring
undue
burden
but
would
come
in
in
the
question
of
security,
deferring
to
security
interests.
i'm
not
sure
the
case
would
look
that
much
different
when
the
question
is
just
a
financial
one.
but
i
would
add
in
response
to
your
hypothetical--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there's
a
question--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there
would
be
a
question
that
would
arise
whether
you
have
to
do
any
sort
of
new
and
separate
program
at
all,
whether
that...
regardless
of
how
much
it
might
cost.
whether
you
would
have
to
run
a
separate
or
new
program,
that
would
be
a
question.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
the
question
is
whether
you're
being
denied
access
to
services
or
a
program
that
is
being
provided
by
the
institution.
here,
the
program
or
service
is
the
boot
camp
program,
and
the
question
would
be,
would
admission
to
that
require
fundamentally
altering
that
program.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if
rigorous
physical
exercise
is
an
essential
part
of
that
program,
and
there
is
no...
it
wouldn't
matter
how
much
money
it
would
cost
to
construct
another
one,
it
would
be
a
different
program.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
if
it
doesn't
substantially
change
the
nature
of
the
program,
then
if
it's
not
costly,
then
it
may
have
to
be
provided
under
the
ada
and
section
504
as
well.
on...
now,
there
is
no
question
that
states
provide
programs,
services,
or
activities.
state
prisons
do.
they
provide
medical
services
to
inmates.
they
provide
recreational
activities,
and
they
also
provide
many
programs
like
the
boot
camp
program
at
issue
in
this
case,
so
there's
no
basis
for
an
exemption
in
the
terms,
programs,
services,
or
activities.
i
wanted
to
add
that
there's
nothing
unusual
at
all
about
applying
the
ada
to
state
prisons.
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
ada,
the
section
504
of
the
rehabilitation
act
already
applied
through
the
department
of
justice's
regulations
to
state
prisons
receiving
federal
funding
and
to
the
federal
bureau
of
prisons.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
statute--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it's
perfectly
clear
what
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
would
not
disagree
with
that.
i
would
only
add
that
they
didn't
specifically
mention
prisons,
but
the
department
of
justice
regulations
did.
the
final
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
that
petitioners'
reliance
on
gregory
v.
ashcroft
and
the
principles
of
constitutional
doubt
is
misplaced
in
this
case.
each
of
those
principles
only
comes
into
play
when
there
is
genuine
ambiguity
in
a
statute
to
resolve
and
here
there
is
no
genuine
ambiguity.
the
text
of
the
act
clearly
and
unambiguously
prohibits
state
prisons
from
discriminating
against
disabled
inmates,
so
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
should
be
affirmed.
if
there
aren't
any
further
questions--
