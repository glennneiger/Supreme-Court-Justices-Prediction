that
doesn't
make
a
difference,
though.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
argue,
do
you,
or
maybe
you
do,
that
in
apportioning
this
income
for
people
who
work
full
or
part-time
in
new
york,
that
new
york
has
to
allow
personal
deductions
of
various
kinds
to
out-of-state
residents,
do
you?
i
mean,
deductions
that
don't
relate
to
the
production
of
income
in
new
york?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let's
talk
about
that
kind
of
deduction.
it
doesn't
relate
to
the
production
of
your
income
in
new
york.
now,
does
new
york
have
to
worry
about
personal
deductions
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
you
don't
earn
all
your
income
in
new
york,
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
a
person
who
earns
all
income
in
new
york
but
lives
in
connecticut,
strictly
the
bedroom
community
situation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
to
that
person,
there
would
be
a
very
substantial
difference,
i
suppose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
alimony
is
not
deductible.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
course,
when
i
asked
you
that
question
at
the
start,
you
said,
oh,
no,
no,
no,
we're
just
talking
about
alimony
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
there's
a
big
difference,
and
that's
all
we're
talking
about,
and
we're
not
going
to
talk
about
personal
deductions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
we've
got
a
whole
different
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
and
you're
only
asking
for
it
to
the
extent
that
new
york
allows
the
same
deduction
for
its
own
residents.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
our
test
was
something
along
the
following
lines,
that
a
statute
that
discriminates
against
nonresidents
must
be
justified
by
a
substantial
reason
for
the
discrimination
against
the
nonresidents,
beyond
the
mere
fact
that
they're
citizens
of
another
state.
what
do
you
think
the
reason
is
that's
offered
by
new
york
here,
and
is
it
substantial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
let's
consider
the
situation,
which
must
occur
with
some
frequency,
of
people
who
earn
all
their
earned
income
in
new
york
and
live
outside
the
city,
outside
the
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
end
result
is
going
to
be
the
payment
of
a
substantially
higher
tax
than
would
be
the
case
for
a
similarly
situated
new
york
resident
who
nevertheless
lived
in
new
york.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
substantial
reason
that
new
york
offers
for
the
validity
of
such
an
arrangement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
former
wife
receiving
the
alimony
lived
in
new
york,
would
that
spouse
be
taxed
on
the
alimony
income
by
new
york?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
but
you
don't,
on
the
other
hand,
allow
the
deduction
as
a
result,
as
the
federal
government
would.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
that
under
our
cases,
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
there
had
to
be
a
reasonable
relationship
between
whatever
the
evil
is
presented
by
the
nonresident
and
the
rule
adopted
by
the
state,
and
i
just
haven't
heard
what
that
reasonable
relationship
is
here
to
justify
new
york's
rule.
i'd
really
like
to
hear
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
is
it
a
better
rule
in
the
circumstances
described
by
justice
breyer?
why
is
new
york's
present
rule
better?
it
looks
to
me
like
there
are
some
circumstances
where
it's
an
absolutely
lousy
rule.
