justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
that
would
be
true
even...
supposing
your
divorce
took
place
while
you
were
getting
all
your
income
in
connecticut,
and
then
you
later
started
to
practice
in
new
york
and
had
the
same
alimony,
would
that
make
it
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
relying
on
the
fact
that
your
alimony
is
partially
determined
by
your
new
york
income,
but
we'd
have
the
same
case
before
us
if
that
were
not
the
fact.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
just
for
my
own
clarification?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
correct
that
the
rate
that
new
york
imposes
on
the
nonresident
is
based
in
part
on
the
nonresident's
non-new
york
income?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you...
did
you...
you
didn't
challenge
that
feature
of
the
tax
in
this
case,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lunding,
are
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--are
you
attacking
the
new
york
statute
as
it
applies
to
your
particular
facts,
or
are
you
saying
it
is
invalid
as
to
everybody
who
doesn't
get
an
alimony
deduction?
justice
john
paul
stevens
across
the
board.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
in
effect
here
on
behalf
of
the
person
who
has
100-percent
new
york
income,
100
percent
of
his
income
comes
from
new
york,
but
if
his
alimony
is...
if
he's
a
nonresident
he
gets
taxed
at
a
higher
rate
than
the
new
york
resident
does.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
we
get
into
this
fascinating
question
of
what
is
the
standard
for
judging
a
facial
attack,
because
under
your
view...
you
might
say
it's
clearly
unconstitutional
in
the
hypothetical
you
have
in
your
brief
about
the...
all
the
income
comes
from
a
new
york...
you
know,
a
new
york
resident
and
a
nonresident
both
earn
all
their
income
in
new
york.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
the
other
hand,
at
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum
you
say
it's
perfectly
all
right...
you
might
say
it's
perfectly
all
right
on
a
fact
picture
such
as
yours,
because--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
income
is...
you
know,
is
different.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
address
at
the
outset
the
one
little
flaw
in
that
presentation,
namely
the
rate
is
in
part
determined
by
non-new
york
income
and
therefore,
whether
directly
or
indirectly,
you
are
to
a
certain
extent
taxing
this
gentleman
at
a
higher
rate
than
you
would
someone
who
had
just
the
same
amount
of
new
york
income,
who
lived
in
new
york,
that
he
has.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
really
are
in
a
way,
if
the
bottom
line,
you
get
more
money
than
you
would
if
that
weren't
the
fact.
whether
you
say
it's
taxing,
it
does
affect
the
total
tax
he
pays.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
affects
the
rate,
the...
more
money
on
the
check
he
has
to
write
to
you.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
what's
the
percentage
of...
you
say...
i
believe
mr.
lunding
said
the
high
end
of
new
york's
tax
rate
was
9
percent.
what
is
the
low
rate?
what
is
the
low
end?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
isn't
it
true
that...
one
of
the
things
that
troubles
me,
and
i...
it's
a
very
troublesome
case...
is
if
the
nonresident
turns
out
in
one
year
to
be
extraordinarily
generous,
giving
large
amounts
of
money
to
charity,
to
hospitals,
one
thing
and
another,
they're
all
deductible
on
his
federal
return.
the
net
effect
of
that
is
to
increase
his
new
york
tax,
because
it
makes
the
denominator
so
much
bigger
in
your
fraction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
in
a
way
his
activities
out
of
state...
this
is
a
second
way
in
which
activities
out
of
state
impact
on
the
tax
he
pays
in
new
york
in
kind
of
a
perverse
way,
because
if
he's
a
very
generous
person,
he'll
end
up
with
a
higher
new
york
tax.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
that
he
would
have
had
to
pay
if
he
didn't
do
all
these
things.
if
he
didn't
have
all
those
deductions
the
denominator
would
be
smaller,
and
therefore
his
new
york
would
be
smaller.
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
failed
to
understand
that
from
the
briefs.
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--can
i
just
give
you
one
hypothetical
that
keeps
running
through
my
mind
and
just
ask
you
to
comment
on
it?
supposing
you've
got
a
connecticut
resident
and
a
new
york
resident,
both
of
whom
make
exactly
the
same
amount
of
money,
both
of
whom
derive
all
of
their
income
from
new
york...
they're
commuters.
one
of
them
is
a
commuter
and
one
lives
in
the
city,
and
one
of
them,
the
one
who
lives
in
connecticut,
donates
a
substantial
amount
of
money
to
the
law
school
in
new
york
and
wants
a
charitable
deduction.
the
one
who
lives
in
new
york
donates
a
substantial
amount
of
money
to
yale
in
connecticut.
the
one
who
gets
the
deduction
is
the
one
who
makes
a
donation
to
the
new
york
recipient.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
the
one
who
does
not
get
the
deduction
is
the
one...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
they
be
taxed
the
same
in
my
hypothetical
as...
would
the
bottom
line
be
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought,
to
oversimplify
it,
that
the
new
york
resident
would
get
the
deduction
and
the
connecticut
resident
would
not,
in
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
the
distinction
is
that
new
york
treats
nonresidents
as
just
purely
mechanical
money-making
machines,
whereas
it
treats
its
own
people
as
whole
persons
and
citizens
who
have
all
sorts
of
interests
other
than
making
money,
because
that's
what
you
treat
the
nonresident--
--they're
new
yorkers,
after
all.
yes.
[laughter]
or
they're
non-new
yorkers.
