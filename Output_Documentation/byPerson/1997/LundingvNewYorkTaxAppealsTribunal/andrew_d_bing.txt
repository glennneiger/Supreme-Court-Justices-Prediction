mr.
andrew
d.
bing
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
really
whether
new
york
is
required
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
to
afford
nonresidents
an
alimony
deduction
because
it
affords
the
same
alimony
deduction
to
residents.
in
new
york's
view,
new
york
is
not
so
required
because
the
basis
upon
which
new
york
taxes
residents
and
nonresidents
is
completely
different.
new
york's
taxation
of
residents
is
based
on
the
fact
that
they
reside
within
new
york,
residence
giving
new
york
plenary
jurisdiction
over
their
income
from
every
source
worldwide.
with
respect
to
nonresidents,
the
basis
of
new
york's
taxation
is
that
nonresidents--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--justice
stevens,
it
is
correct
that
we
tax...
that
the
rate
is
set
based
upon
the
nonresident's
worldwide
income,
but
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
a
moment
ago
we
are
not
taxing
the--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--it
affects
the
rate,
justice
stevens.
the--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--the--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--it
does.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
during
the...
during
1990,
the
lowest
marginal
rate
for
married
filing
jointly
and
surviving
spouse
was
4
percent,
and
the
highest
rate
at
which
i
believe...
the
top
marginal
rate
was
7.875
percent,
which
was
the
rate
at
which
the
additional
deficiency
was
calculated
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
those--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--it
is
true
that
in
the
case
of
the
nonresident
who
derived
all,
or
substantially
all
his
or
her
income
in
new
york,
that
the
tax
that
the
nonresident
pays
would
be
higher
than
the
resident
who
derives
all
of
his
income
in
new
york.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
this
is
the
inevitable
result
of
the
fact
that
new
york,
with
respect
to
nonresidents,
is
only
looking
at,
and
believes
it
is
entitled
to
only
look
at
their
net
income
from
the
economic
activity
that
they
conduct
within
new
york
state,
and
that
deductions,
however
large
they
may
be
in
relationship
to
the
total
income,
which
have
no
relat...
which
are
not
incurred
to
produce
or
to
generate
that
in-state
income,
are
simply
not
something
that
new
york
is
required
to
take
into
account.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
but
again--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--in
the
context
of
the
new
york
resident,
again
we
are
looking
not
only
at
the
new
york
resident's
new
york
income
but
the
new
york
resident's
worldwide
income,
and
so
the
new
york
resident
as
a
general
matter
is
someone
who
will
generally
be
subject
to
a
burden
of
taxation
which
is
greater
than
that
of
an
individual
in
petitioner's
situation.
again,
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
residence
also
affords
the
state
an
opportunity
to
take
into
account
certain
personal
activities
of
its
residents
that
it
is
not
in
our
view
required
to
take
into
account
for
purposes
of
nonresidents,
and
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
absolute
equality
of
treatment
has
never
been
the
hallmark.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
your
mathematics
are
entirely
correct,
and
your
application
of
the
formula
are
correct.
the
justification
for
it
that
new
york
has
offered
is,
i
guess,
twofold.
the
first
one,
again,
is
this
is
exactly
the
result
that
is
contemplated
by
this
court's
decision
in
shaffer
and
by
this
court's
decisions
in
the
portion
of
travis
upon
which
we
rely,
and
has
been
accepted--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--the
taxpayer
in
travis
also
specifically
challenged
a
provision
of
the
new
york...
then
new
york
tax
laws,
section
360,
subdivision
11,
which
permitted
nonresidents
the
deductions
available
to
residents
only
if
and
to
the
extent
connected
with
new
york
income,
and
the
taxpayer
specifically
challenged
that
provision
in
its
brief
in
this
court
arguing
that
it
would,
for
example,
disallow
the
connecticut
resident
who
worked
in
new
york
the
deduction
for
his
real
property
taxes
while
at
the
same
time
allowing
the
new
york
resident
a
deduction
for
the
real
property
taxes
on
the
new
york
residence.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
i
believe
that
because
of
the
posture
of
that
case
and
because
of
who
the
taxpayer
was
that
issue
was
hypothetical.
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
was
a
connecticut
corporation
that
employed
a
number
of
connecticut
residents
in
new
york
as
well
as
residents
of
other
states
and
was
challenging
the
entire
personal
income
tax
treatment
of
nonresidents,
including
personal
exemptions,
including
the
fact
that
it
was
required
to
withhold
only
with
respect
to
nonresidents
in
this
deduction
provision.
so
there
were
a
number
of
provisions
that
were
being
challenged
by
the
employer
rather
than
by
any
particular
taxpayer
who
was
pointing
to
him
or
herself
and
saying,
this
tax
adversely
affects
me
this
way,
but
that
example
was
included
within
their
brief,
and
i
believe
that
that
example
was
what
this
court
responded
to
when
it
said
that
the
state
is
permitted
to
limit
the
deduction
in
the
case
of
nonresidents
to
those
expenses
that
are
connected
with
the
new
york
income,
as
settled
by
the
shaffer
case.
i
think
they
were
referring
to
that
particular
contention
of
the
taxpayer
in
the
travis
case,
and
subsequent
to
travis,
this
court
has
repeatedly
in
summary
dismissals
in
effect
permitted
states
to
recognize
that
the
difference
in
tax
treatment
which
is
mandated
by
the
constitution,
the
fact
that
we
can
only
reach
the
nonresident's
state-source
income,
permits,
justifies
a
state
treating
personal
deductions
differently
in
the
case
of
nonresidents.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
we
treat
alimony...
in
our
view
alimony
is
properly
treated
as
a
personal
expense
deduction
because
it
is
not
incurred
to
produce
income
within
new
york
state,
that
new
york
state--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--the
residence
of
the
recipient
is
not
a
factor
in
our
analysis.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
yes,
new
york
would
tax
the
recipient.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
regardless
of
the
location
of
the
payor.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
we--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--the...
again,
the
relationship
is,
i
guess,
twofold.
first,
we
don't
tax
the
nonresident
with
respect
to
anything
that
occurs
outside
new
york,
and
in
our
view
we
are
not
required,
as
a
result
of
that,
to
take
into
account
with
respect
to
the
nonresident
anything
that
is
unrelated
to
the
economic
activity
that
that
nonresident
is
doing
within
the
state
of
new
york.
again,
we're
put
in
the
posture
of
not
being
able
to
afford
equality
of
treatment.
from
the
very
beginning,
this
is
not
a
case
where
new
york
has
gone
out
of
its
way
to
single
out
nonresidents.
they're
different
by
virtue
of
the
due
process
clause
and
by
virtue
of
our
reach.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
we
don't
dispute
that
that
is
a
reasonable
approach.
in
fact,
it's
one
that
new
york
did
follow
between
1961
and
1987.
we
do
believe,
however,
that
new
york
is
not
required
to
afford
a
proportionate
deduction,
and
we
believe
that
our
rule
is,
in
fact,
a
better
rule
because
it
recognizes
that
the
alimony
simply
has
nothing
to
do
with
where
petitioner
earns
his
income.
there's
no
particular
reason--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--there
are
cases
where
the
hypothetical
posited
by
justice
breyer
will
happen.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
that's
true,
but--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--he
ends
up
with
a
higher
new
york
tax
than
a
comparably
situated
new
york
resident
having
the
same--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--with
respect
to
charitable
contribution
deductions
i'm
not
sure
that
they...
because
they
don't
affect
either...
they're
below-the-line
deductions,
in
other
words.
they're
deductions
from
adjusted
gross
income
for
federal
purposes--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--to
get
the
taxable
income.
they're
not...
i
believe
that
the
fraction
is
neutral
with
respect
to
them,
because
they
are
not
a
reduction
of
either
new
york-source
income
or
federal
adjusted
gross
income.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
federal
adjusted
gross
is
the
denominator
in
that,
so
with
respect
to
those,
i
don't
believe
that
there
would
be
a
difference
akin
to
the
difference
with
respect
to
alimony,
but--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--the
second
one
is
simply,
again,
the
concept
that
new
york
can
do
for
its
residents
things
that
it
is
not
obligated
to
do
for
nonresidents,
and
that...
again,
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
and
other
provisions
of
the
constitution
have
been
allowed...
have
been
construed
to
permit
certain
beneficial
residence
treatments
based
on
policy
adopted
by
particular
states
with
respect
to
the
right
to
vote,
the
right
to
hold
elective
office,
the
right
to
free
public
education
or
welfare
or
medical
benefits.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
it's
not
intended
to
be
a
simply-because-we-can
argument,
justice
scalia.
with
respect
to
the
treatment
of
alimony,
the
policy,
if
you
will,
is
to
really
conform
the
treatment
of
alimony,
of
income-splitting
post
marriage
with
the
treatment
of
income-splitting
if
people
are
married.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
it's
because
with
respect
to
married
people
we
don't
allow
income-splitting
unless
they're
both
residents.
if
one
of
the
parties
is
a
nonresident,
income-splitting
is
not
permitted
in
the
case
of
people
who
are
still
married,
and
this
provision
is...
conforms
that
same
rule
with
respect
to
income-splitting
with
respect
to
people
who
are
no
longer
married.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
well,
the
treatment
of
marital
income
generally
was
addressed
in
'87,
and
at
that
time
new
york
abolished
the
filing-separately-on-the-same-return
status
that
married
people
had
previously
enjoyed
and
went
to
more
or
less
full
income-splitting
for
the
first
time,
which
is
premised
on
the
assumption
that
spouses
share
total
marital
income
equally.
again,
that
was
the
assumption
underlying
treatment
of
people
who
are
still
married
to
each
other,
and
because
alimony,
as
you
pointed
out,
is
a
tax-shifting
device
rather
than
a
true
deduction,
the
treatment
of
alimony
with
respect
to
nonresidents
was
designed
to
bring
it
into
congruence
with
the
treatment
of
income-splitting
for
people
who
are
still
together,
still
married
to
each
other.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
there
is
a
relationship,
but
in
our
view
the
controlling
standard
is
the
one
set
forth
by
this
court
in
the
gilmore
case,
which
looks
to
the
origin
of
the
claim
in
characterizing
an
expense
as
personal
or
business
under
section
162
of
the
internal
revenue
code
with
respect
to
marital
dissolution.
in
gilmore,
simply
because
the
expenses
were
incurred
to
preserve
and
to
protect
the
taxpayer's
income-producing
assets,
it
was
not
enough
to
give
them
a
sufficient
nexus
to
make
them
related
under
section
162
to
be
deductible
for
income
tax
purposes.
we
argue
the
same
standard
ought
to
apply
in
a
case
like
this,
that
the
alimony
in
this
case,
related
though
it
may
have
been
to
petitioner's...
the
amount
of
petitioner's
worldwide
income,
including
the
new
york-source
income,
was
not
incurred
to
produce
that
income,
or
incurred
in
carrying
on
the
trade
or
business
that
generated
that
income,
and
that
that
should
be
the
test
with
respect
to
alimony
or
any
other
personal
expense.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
i
believe
that
in
addition
to
new
york
there
are
six
other
states
that
specifically
disallow
alimony
deductions.
however,
there
are
a
number
of
other
states
that
have
relied
upon
the
general
tenor
of
the
shaffer
and
travis
cases,
as
well
as
summary
dismissals
such
as
goodwin,
to
treat
a
number
of
different
items
differently
for
nonresidents,
including,
in
addition
to
the
alimony
expenses
we're
talking
about
today,
real
estate
taxes
and
mortgage
interest
in
out-of-state
residence,
medical
expenses,
insurance
premiums,
moving
expenses,
income
averaging,
rollover
of
gain
on
sale
of
principal
residence,
grocery
and
medical
tax
rebates,
food
sales
tax
credit,
and
homestead
tax
rebates,
all
of
which
have
been
upheld
under
privileges
and
immunities
clause
challenges.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
the
deduction
would
not
be
allowed
in
computing
new
york-source
income,
that
is
correct,
because
it
does
not
relate
to
the
production
of
the
new
york-source
income.
i
guess
i'd
like
to
address
the
policy
reason.
what
is
it
about
these
personal
deductions
and
about
the
nonresident
status
that
seems
to
be...
that
justifies
what
we're
doing,
and
again,
we're
not
simply
saying
we're
doing
it
because
shaffer
and
travis
and
goodwin
and
the
others
say
we
can.
we're
doing
it
because
we
think
it's
perfectly
reasonable,
and
it's
entirely
justified
for
new
york
to
say
with
respect
to
nonresidents,
all
we
have
jurisdiction
over
regarding
you
is
what
you
do
here,
your
economic
activity
here,
and
that
it's
reasonable
and
permissible
for
us
to
say
to
those
people,
we
will
allow
you
deductions
with
respect
to
the
production
of
the
income,
the
net
income
from
your
economic
activity.
we'll
look
at
what
you
do
here,
and
we'll
let
you
deduct
that.
we'll
tax
you
on
your
net
income,
but
we're
not
going
to
let
you
take
into
account
either
losses
or
deductions
arising
from
expenses
in
out-of-state
businesses
over
which
we
have
no
jurisdiction,
and
we're
also
not
going
to
take
into
account
personal
expenses
that
you
may
incur
in
your
personal
life
in
some
other
jurisdiction,
even
though
with
respect
to
people
who
reside
in
new
york
we
will
allow
them.
new
york
has
believed
and
continues
to
believe
that
that
is
a
substantial
justification
and
a
legitimate
reason
for
what
new
york
has
done
in
this
case.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
again,
we're
not
saying
that
the
contention
is...
is
being
argued
for
in
terms
of
this
would
be
a
reasonable
approach
is
not
true.
we're
not
saying
it's
an
unreasonable
approach,
but
we
are
saying
that
we
don't
think
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--requires
that
absolute
equality,
or
at
least
that
percentage
equality
of
treatment.
and
again,
these
expense
actions
have
nothing
to
do
with
where
mr.
lunding
earned
his
income,
and
there
really
is
no
principle
basis,
other
than
just
saying,
well,
20
percent
of
the
income,
20
percent
of
the
deductions,
for
looking
at
what
happened
in
connecticut.
there's
no
reason
for
us
to
say
well,
it
could
be
20,
but
it
could
be
more
than
20.
we
could
say
that
with
respect
to
his
medical
expenses
he's
entitled
to
more
than
that
because
it
was
really
primarily
related
to
his
getting
back
and
forth
to
new
york
and
dealing
with
the
rush-hour
traffic.
i
mean,
there's
no
principled
reason,
no
constitutional
principled
requirement
for
new
york
to
be
forced
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
to
adopt
a
rateable
approach,
even
though,
as
i
said,
that
is
one
that
new
york
has
followed
in
the
past.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
well,
justice
stevens,
in
computing--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--in
computing
the
new
york-source
income
portion
of
the
equation,
that's
correct,
but
in
computing
the
tax
as
if
a
resident,
which
is
the
number
by
which
the
fraction
is
multiplied,
you
do
treat
the
nonresident
as
if
the
nonresident
were
a
resident,
so
that
there
is...
again,
this
doesn't
affect
the
computation
of
the
fraction,
because
the
charitable
contribution--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--deduction
is
below
the
line
in
both
cases,
so
there
is
a--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--i
believe
that
the...
obviously
the...
when
you
computed
the
new
york...
the
taxes
if
a
resident,
on
the
part
of
the
new
york
resident,
then
obviously
you'd
stop,
because
that
would
be
the
answer.
the
percentage
of
that
that
would
be
paid
by
the
nonresident
wouldn't
be
affected
by
the
formula,
by
the
fraction,
which
is
the
other
thing,
because
new
york-source
income
is
a
net
number
without
any
reduction
for...
itemized
deduction
such
as
the
charitable
contribution.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
in
looking
at
the
new
york
fraction,
justice
stevens,
there's
no
difference
in
the
new
york-source
income
number...
there
would
be
no
deduction
in
computing
new
york-source
income
for
the
charitable
contribution.
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
our--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--it's
true
that
i
believe
our
argument
would
permit...
it
doesn't
work
in
new
york's
particular
methodology,
but
our
argument
is
based
on
the
legitimacy
of
permitting
states
to
focus
solely
on
the
economic
activity
within
the
state
and
not
to
look
at
the
personal--
mr.
andrew
d.
bing
--in
fact,
as
to
new
york
state,
that
is
a
permissible...
in
our
view,
that's
all
right.
that's
a
distinction
that
we
seek
to
draw.
it's
a
distinction
that
new
york
and
other
states
have
always,
at
least
since
1920,
thought
that
they
had
the
power
to
draw,
and
it's
a
reasonable
distinction
based
on
the
fact
that
we
argue
that
we
should
not
be
required
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
yes,
mr.
lunding
does
have
a
personal
life,
but
it's
a
personal
life
that
is
related
to
connecticut,
not
related
to
any
of
the
other
places
from
which
mr.
lunding
derives
his
income.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you,
your
honor.
