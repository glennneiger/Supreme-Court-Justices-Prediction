mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
calendar
year
1990
i
was
a
lawyer
practicing
law
in
the
city
of
new
york
and
residing
some
38
miles
from
my
office
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
some
9,000
feet,
plus
or
minus,
over
the
state
border.
it
is
something
i
did
not
think
of
when
i
moved
to
the
state
of
connecticut
that
i
would
be
here
today
on
my
on
behalf,
challenging
a
statute
of
the
state
of
new
york
as
discriminating
against
me
as
a
nonresident
in
taxation.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
a
little
less
than
2
miles
over
the
state
line,
your
honor,
into
connecticut.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
right.
close
to
the
border.
not
that
i
think
that
in--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--no,
it
does
not,
your
honor.
i
do
not
urge
that
the
distance
from
the
state
line
is
legally
relevant
in
this
case.
what
is
legally
relevant,
though,
is
the
question
of
the
constitutionality
of
new
york
state
tax
law
631(b)(6),
which
entirely
denies--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well,
the
money
is
fungible,
justice
o'connor,
and
a
substantial
portion
of
my
income
and
a
much
more
substantial
person...
portion
of
other
taxpayers'
nonresident-in-new
york
income
is
earned
in
the
state
of
new
york.
i
think
there
could
be
made
a
persuasive
argument
that,
because
of
that,
it
is
a
requirement
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
that
nonresidents
be
allowed
to
take
deductions
in
proportion
that
their
new
york
income
bears
to
their
total
income
for
personal
expense
items.
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
that
point
in
this
case,
and
that's
particularly
because
the
nature
of
alimony
is
very
different
from
the
nature
of
other
personal
expense
items
in
several
respects.
in
the
first
respect,
in
the
state
of
connecticut,
as
well
as
in
other
states,
the
amount
of
alimony
is
based,
must
be
based
upon
the
payor's
total
income
from
all
sources.
inevitably...
one
case
so
holding
is
wanatowitz
v.
wanatowitz,
which
is
found
in
533
a.
2d.
because
of
that,
inevitably
in
the
setting
of
the
amount
of
the
alimony
my
new
york
income
was
taken
into
account.
so
that's
point
number
1.
there's
a
direct
connection
there
between
the
alimony
and
my
new
york
income
which
is
not
present
if
it
were
a
charitable
deduction,
or
a
real
estate
tax,
or
any
number
of--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--that
may
be
true,
but
it
wouldn't...
but
the
property
tax
would
not
be
determined
based
upon
my
new
york
income
in
part.
that's
the
difference
i'm
articulating
here.
alimony
specifically
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
total
income.
property
taxes
are
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
value
of
the
real
estate
in
question,
and
therefore
not
so
clearly
connected
to--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well,
we--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--right.
i
believe
i
must
say
that
that
is
correct,
and
it's
because
this
statute
has
as
its
unitary
basis
for
discrimination
nonresidents
and
no
other
factor.
it
is,
of
course,
true
that
only
that
factor
is
really
before
this
court,
and
to
some
degree
all
other
elements
are
extraneous.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
that--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--right.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
they
are
discriminating--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well,
let
me--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--let
me
go
back
and
state
the
analysis
here
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
the
first
element
is,
is
this
statute
discriminatory
against
nonresidents.
there's
a
two-prong
test.
i
will
answer
your
question,
but
in
a
long
way,
if
i
may.
the
first
test
is
to
be
satisfied
is,
is
this
statute
discriminatory?
well,
this
statute
is
discriminatory.
it
has
one
sole,
unique,
intentional
purpose,
which
is
to
discriminate
against
nonresidents
by
denying
this
particular
adjustment
to
income.
that
element
is
satisfied
in
this
case.
the
state
of
new
york
is
unclear
actually
on
that
point,
but
objectively
we
certainly
assert
that
it's
satisfied.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
correct.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
i
would
not
agree
with
that
conclusion,
your
honor,
but
i
would
point
out
this
about
the
nature
of
alimony.
the
statute
calls
alimony
a
deduction,
and
we...
we're
talking
about
personal
deductions
here.
alimony
is
not
really
a
deduction
at
all.
for
federal
purposes
and
for
new
york
purposes
it
is
an
adjustment
to
income,
meaning
it
is...
and
it
is
taken
out
of
the
income
of
the
payor,
transferred
to...
functionally
the
responsibility
to
pay
tax
transferred
to
the
income
of
the
payee,
or
the
recipient
for
tax
purposes.
on
your
federal
return
that's
the
way
it
works,
and
if
you're
a
resident
in
new
york
that's
the
way
it
works,
and
that's
irrespective
of
where
the
recipient
lives.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
right.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
right.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
right.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
my
point
there
was,
if
i
had
been
a
resident
of
new
york
there
would
have
been
an
adjustment
in
which
i
would
have
been
absolved
entirely
for
the
tax
on
the
alimony
amount,
and
it
would
have
been
transferred
to
my
spouse.
now,
the
new
york
statute
doesn't
require
for
that
operation
for
a
resident
that
the
spouse
live
in
new
york.
the
spouse
could
live
anywhere
in
the
world,
and
if
the
spouse
did
not
live
in
new
york
there
would
be
no
tax
captured
by
new
york
on
any
part
of
that
transferred
income,
so
this
is
really,
i
believe,
a
factor
which
is
not
a
motivating
factor
for
new
york,
and
if
you
look
at
it
in
terms
of
the
incidence
of
the
tax
as
to
residence,
it
apparently
is
completely
irrelevant
in
the
economic
analysis.
in
the
case
of
nonresidents,
in
any
event
the
residence
of
the
recipient
is
also
irrelevant.
the
statute
doesn't
say,
which
it
could,
if
the
recipient
lives
in
new
york,
and
therefore
we
tax
that
money
in
new
york,
we
let
you
off
the
hook,
connecticut
taxpayer.
it
hits
everybody.
this
is...
these
are
another
example
of
extraneous
elements
that
are
not
really
involved
here,
where
the
only
basis
for
discrimination
is
nonresidence
and
everything
else
is--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--yes.
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well,
austin
v.
new
hampshire
teaches
us
that
new
york
has
to
treat
nonresidents
under
a
rule
of
substantial
equality
of
treatment,
and--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--as
regards
personal
expenses,
the
answer
is
no,
because
money
being
fungible,
as
a
practical
matter,
looking
at
the
actual,
practical
impact
of
the
tax,
which
is
the
method
of
analysis,
not
labels,
not
anything
else,
but
the
actual
practical
impact,
there
is
a
discrimination
here.
there
is
a
higher
tax
paid
by
nonresidents
than
by
residents.
it
is
not
insubstantial
in
this
instance
or
in
any
other,
and
it
is
much
worse
in
the
case
of
people
with
proportionately
greater
new
york-source
income
in
proportion
to
the
whole,
and
therefore
new
york
may
not,
the
petitioners
urge,
distinguish
between
the
two
in
the
manner
that
this
statute
does.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
about
half
of
it
in
my
case,
year-in,
year-out.
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
there
are
many
such
people,
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
the
state
has--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--or...
well,
it
would
be...
yes,
that
is
correct,
and
the
amount
of
course,
would
vary
according
to
how
much
alimony,
and
in
proportion
to
the
total
income,
but
in
that
scenario
the
amount
which
would
be
paid
by
the
nonresident
in
new
york
tax
would
be
greater
than
the
amount
that
would
be
paid
by
a
resident
of
new
york.
i
mean,
in
whole
dollars,
not
in
proportion
to
anything.
and
this
is
another
problem
with
the
way
this
statute
does
operate.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
that's
correct.
the
case
that
allowed
that
is
named
brady
v.
state,
and
they
take
into
account
worldwide
income
in
setting
the
rate,
which
is
progressive.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
no,
i
did
not,
and
i...
therefore
i
don't
have
the
standing
to...
i
have
a
view
on
it,
but
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
necessarily
to
state
it
at
this
time.
but
you're--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
i
don't
really...
9
percent,
i
believe,
currently.
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
what
it
is
today,
but
it's
8
or
9
percent
is
the...
and
i'm
thinking
about
1990.
i
frankly
don't
remember.
but
that's
ball
park,
and
it
is
progressive,
and
they
do
tax...
they
do
take
into
account
in
setting
the
rate
worldwide
income,
and
that
could
be
another
basis
upon
which
it
could
be
said
as
a
matter
of
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
that
they
also
must
allow
some
proportion
of
worldwide
deductions,
whatever
they
may
be,
or
adjustments,
because
strictly
speaking
alimony
is
not
a
deduction,
not
subject,
for
example,
to
the
federal
limit
on
deductions,
but
an
income
transfer,
as
justice
ginsburg
pointed
out.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
the
actual
effect
in
any
particular
case
will,
of
course,
vary
according
to
the
personal
circumstances,
where
the
receiving
ex-spouse
lives
and
many
other
factors,
but
the
effect
of
this
statute
in
all
cases
compared
to
the
situation
if
the
statute
were
not
there
will
be
to
discriminate
against
nonresident
taxpayers
who
pay
alimony,
because
this
reduction
in
their
income,
taxable
income,
will
obviously
discriminate.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
treat
differently
than
residents
who
pay
alimony,
yes,
that's
what
i
mean,
and
the
amount
in
this
case
is
[dollars]
3,724
for
the
year
1990
in
my
particular
case,
or
a
15-percent
increase
in
the
tax
in
my
case.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
it
did
not
have
a
tax
on
earned
income
in
1990
at
all.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
issue.
the
year
in
issue.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
looking
at
the
matter
currently,
the
tax
rate
in
connecticut
is
4-1/2
percent.
the
tax
rate
in
new
york
is...
i
don't
remember,
8
or
9
percent.
the
deduction
in
connecticut
is
at
the
rate
in
connecticut,
and
therefore
there
still
is
something
left
over
to
be
discriminatory
on
that
regime,
4-1/2
percent,
whatever
it
is,
the
difference
between
the
marginal
rates
in
the
two
states,
but--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--no,
and
that
is
because
in
austin
v.
new
hampshire
this
court
held
that
the
constitutionality
of
one
state
statute
that
discriminates
against
nonresidents
may
not
be...
depend
upon
the
present
configuration
of
the
statutes
of
another
state,
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here
as
to
the
state
of
connecticut.
what
its
tax
laws
may
or
may
not
be
at
any
particular
time
cannot
be
the
basis
for
holding
constitutional
this
discriminatory
statute
in
the
state
of
new
york.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
there
are
commentators...
professor
hellerstein
in
a
1974
article
in
the
michigan
law
review
seems
to
suggest
a
possible
test
in
the
abstract
that
there
would
be
some
particular
deductions
which
are
particularly
tied
to
the
particular
circumstances
of
the
state
of
residence,
without
identifying
what
they
are.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
no,
i
don't
think
that...
well,
the
petitioners
would
not
agree
with
that
statement.
austin--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well,
the
standard
there...
i'm
thinking
of
allied
stores
v.
bowers,
which
is
one
of
the
places
where
the
test
you're
describing
i
believe
is
set
forth.
assuming
first
that
the
particular
act
by
the
state
does
not
violate
the
federal
constitution,
which
is
what
it
says
in
that
case,
there
is
a
wide
latitude,
but
if
it...
but
if--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--that
assumes
the
conclusion
which
is--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well,
that...
and
in
any
event,
that
is
not
the...
yes,
that's
correct,
but
the
issue
in
the
privileges
&
immunities
context,
in
light
of
austin
v.
new
hampshire,
the
first
thing
is
that
there
is
a
standard
of
review
substantially
more
rigorous
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
for
state
taxing
decisions
affecting
individuals
than
affecting
business
organizations,
trades,
or
professions.
that
is
part
of
what
the
case
says,
and
therefore
i
would
not
agree
that
there
is
a...
in
this
context
a
greater
degree
of
latitude
than
in
others.
in
fact,
in
the
taxing
area
petitioners
would
argue
that
this
is
a
case
where
a
substantially
heightened
scrutiny
is
required,
a
rule
of
substantial
equality
is
required,
and
it
is
our
position
that
it
has
not
been
met
in
this
instance.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
the
only
criterion
that
needs
to
be
addressed...
well,
i
guess
i
under...
i'll
answer
the
question
in
two
parts.
the
only
criterion
that
needs
to
be
addressed
in
this
case
is
evidently
whether
alimony
as
an
adjustment,
and
i've
stated
the
unique
aspects
of
that,
so--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well,
the
simple
principle
view...
the
simple
principle
view
is
that
when
you're
talking
about
taxes
which
fall
by
their
terms
upon
personal
service
income...
and
this
is
a
personal
income
tax
in
new
york.
that's
the
label
that
goes
on
it.
that's
what
it
taxes,
my
personal
individual
income
in
new
york.
when
the
state
wishes
to
tax
a
nonresident's
personal
income,
the
bright
line
rule
would
be
that
if
there
are
personal
deductions,
no
matter
what
they
are,
or
adjustments,
such
as
alimony,
no
matter
what
they
are,
then
they
must
be
allowed
in
the
proportion
that
the
new
york
state
income
bears
to
total
income,
period.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
business
expenses,
or
running
a
donut
shop
in
connecticut,
or
something
along
those
lines
might
be
treated
differently,
and
i'm
thinking
of
shaffer
v.
carter,
which
appeared
to
do
that.
whether
there's
a
principle
basis
to
treat
any
deduction
differently
we
could
debate,
but
we're
talking
about
personal
deductions
here
and
i
was
trying
to
answer
your
specific--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--question
on
that
subject.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
life
insurance
or
home
mortgage
interest?
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
responding
to
justice
scalia,
the
bright
line
rule
which
will
avoid
what...
the
problem
he
foresees
is
to
just
say,
if
you
tax
personal
income,
you
must
give
all
personal
deductions
that
the
state
gives
to
its
own
residents
in
the
proportion
that
the
income
in
that
state
bears
to
total
income.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
therefore
the
answer
would
be,
for
solar
panels
or
for
anything
else,
if
new
york
gives
that
personal
deduction
from
personal
income
of
its
residents,
it
must
do
so
in
proportion
for
nonresidents
which
it
taxes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
right.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--well,
no.
he
asked
me
a
hypothetical
question
about
where
the
line
would
be
in--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--if
we
were
dealing
with
other
subjects.
it
is...
to
be
clear,
it
is
our
position
that
the
question
before
the
court
today
is
one
and
unitary,
and
that
is
the
adjustment-for-alimony
issue,
and
we
do
believe
it's
different,
and
i
pointed
out
why
i
believe
it's
different,
for
many
reasons,
from
the
standard
run
of
personal
deductions--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--and
not
getting
into
solar
panels
or
other
matters.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
the
latter
is
the
answer.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
it
is...
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
it
is
certainly
true
that
the
petitioners
view
themselves...
well,
we
are
attacking
the
statute
on
its
face,
not
as
apply
to
the
petitioners
in
particular,
and
proceeding,
if
you
will,
by
principles
of
stare
decisis
at
least,
whatever
happens
here,
for
the
benefit
of
all
other
nonresidents
similarly
situated
who
pay
alimony.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
right.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--it
would...
the
petitioners
evidently
would
not
agree
with
that
conclusion,
your
honor,
but
i
think
i
may
bring
in
here
some
question
of
the
particular
laws
of
new
york
and
why
i'm
standing
here
alone
rather
than
in
a
representative
capacity
or
some
other.
new
york
has
a
rule,
which
was
stated
in
a
case
called
martin
v.
lavine,
l-a-v-i-n-e,
in
1976
and
elsewhere,
including
in
the
intermediate
appellate
court
in
brady
v.
state,
that
when
a
tax
statute
is
challenged
in
new
york,
generally
speaking,
you
cannot
have
a
representative
action.
you
have
to
proceed
individually,
and
therefore
in
the
state
court
system,
which
is
where
this
started,
you
are
prohibited
from
proceeding
in
a
representative
capacity.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--i
can
only
say
in
brady
v.
state,
which
involved
the
question
of
considering
worldwide
income
and
setting
the
progressive
rate
in
new
york,
it
was
brought
as
a
class
action,
and
it
was
stopped
as
a
class
action
because
of
this
rule,
and
the
rule
is
based
on
the
theory
as
to
the
government
that
an
individual
who
would
win
a
case
on
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
gives
the
benefit
to
all
others
by
way
of
stare
decisis,
and
therefore
there
is
no
need
for--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--yes,
of
course,
but--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
i'm
saying
if
a
bright
line
rule
is
desired,
which
is
what
justice
scalia
asked,
that
that
would
be
a
rational
bright
line
rule
which
would
avoid
the
necessity
for
future
definition
of
what
is
or
is
not
appropriately
required.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
but
that's...
but
it's
not
this
case,
and
we
do
not
argue
for
the
adoption
of
such
a
general
rule
in
this
case.
this
case
is
limited
to
alimony,
and
the
only
purpose
of
the
petitioners
here
is
to
have
a
decision
on
the
question
of
whether
the
adjustment
for
alimony,
which
in
many
ways
is
different
from
other
sorts
of
items
which
are
deductions,
must
be
given
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
right
under
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
it
need
not
get
into
all
this
other--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
it
favors...
well,
it...
well,
i
think
the
standard
under
austin
v.
new
hampshire
is
that
there
is
a
rule
of
substantial
equality
of
treatment
of
nonresidents
mandated
by
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
in
the
area
of
judging
the
constitutionality
of
state
taxes
which
impact
nonresidents,
and
the
petitioners'
view
of
the
matter
is
that
in
this
instance
there
is
a
lack
of
equality.
there
are
no
reasons
for
it
which
are
cognizable,
and
accordingly
it's
a
rather
simple
matter
that
this
particular
exaction
and
the
statute
which
gives
rise
to
it
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
yes,
it
does.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
certainly
petitioners
would
not
object
to
such
a
rule
for...
but--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--i
mean,
i
can
understand
the
struggle
here.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
i
don't
mean
to
indicate...
i
don't
mean
to
indicate,
though,
justice
souter,
that
there
should
necessarily
be
a
different
rule
for
business
than
for
personal
deductions.
i
mention
that
only
because
of
shaffer
v.
carter
and
there
are
no
business
deductions
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
yes.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
no.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
we're
only
asking
for
it
in
proportion.
we're
not
asking
for
it
dollar-for-dollar.
we're
asking
for
it
in
the
proportion
that
the
new
york
state
income
bears
to
the
total
income
and
because
of
that
it
doesn't
raise
the
question
of
fairness
which
i
think
you're--
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
--yes.
it
can
certainly
make
the
decision
not
to
allow
it
to
its
own
residents
and
it
need
not
give
it
to
nonresidents,
and
that's
true
whether
it's
a
deduction
or
an
adjustment
or
they
use
some
other
label
because,
as
this
court's
decisions
tell
us,
labels
are
not
determinative.
it's
the
practical
effect.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
well,
there
are
two
reasons.
one
is
that
there
exists
untaxed
income,
meaning
they
can't
reach
it
because
of
the
due
process
clause
under
shaffer
v.
carter,
and
for
that
reason
they're
free
to
discriminate
as
they
please,
which
is
their
actual
position
as
regards
personal
deductions,
adjustments,
or
whatever.
that
part
of
the
position
is
foreclosed
by
travis
v.
yale
&
towne,
which
says
because
the
statute
does
not
condition
its
discrimination
on
the
existence
of
untaxed
income,
whether
that
exists
or
not
is
irrelevant
to
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
on
its
face,
so
that
reason
number
1,
travis
takes
out.
the
only
other
reason
that...
well,
my
colleague
will
speak
for
himself,
but
the
only
other
reason
that
i
foresee
here
is
the
lack
of
connection
argument
which
we've
been
talking
about
for
most
of
this
oral
argument,
and
we
allege
that
there
is
a
sufficient
connection
and
obvious
connection,
and
that
therefore
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face--
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder...
well,
i
have
no
time
remaining.
mr.
christopher
h.
lunding
thank
you.
