justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
the
way
the
state
of
new
york
would
see
it.
won't...
wouldn't
they
say
we're
not
discriminating
based
solely
on
residence,
we're
discriminating
based
on
(a)
nonresidents,
and
(b)
the
fact
that
this
particular
deduction
was
not
related
to
the
earning
of
income
in
new
york?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
seems
to
me
very,
very...
a
very
different
case.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
am
i
characterizing
their
position
correctly,
to
begin
with?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
perhaps
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
i
don't
think
we
completed
our--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--brief
colloquy
on
what
you
think
the
standard
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
new
york
have
to
treat
residents
precisely
the
same
as
nonresidents
in
every
category
of
taxation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
that
substantial
equality
of
treatment
be
based
on
a
theory
that
the
income...
pardon
me,
that
the
deduction
or
the
adjustment
must
be
related
to
the
income
that's
earned
in
new
york,
and
income-producing
activities
in
new
york?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
some
deductions
or
credits
that
really
are
closely
tied
to
the
taxpayer's
domestic
life
as
opposed
to
his
or
her
business
life?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
life
insurance--
--what
about--
--premiums?
what
about
home...
excuse
me.
what
about...
what
about--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--no.
what
about
a
deduction
for
investing
in
a
solar
panel
for
your
home,
which
is
in
connecticut?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--assuming
we--
--if
justice
souter
would
permit
me
for
just
one
reason,
to--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--justice
scalia
and
justice
ginsburg
and
i
have
all
asked
you,
what
is
your...
we
have
to
write
this
opinion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
this
violates
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
because
it's
not
equal?
that...
that's
not
the
standard.
we
need
a
standard
that's
more
specific
than
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
your
principle
i
suppose
if
a
taxpayer
living
in
connecticut
had
a
second
home
on
long
island
in
new
york,
you
could
deny
him
the
home
interest
deduction.
