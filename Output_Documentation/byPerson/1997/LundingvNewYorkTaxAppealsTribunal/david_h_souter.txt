may
i
raise
one--
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
lunding,
i,
too
would
like
to
have,
if
not
a
bright
line
rule,
at
least
a
bright
line
principle,
and
i
have
this
reservation
about
the
one
that
you
suggested.
you
suggest
a
line
to
be
drawn
essentially
between
personal
expenses
and...
or
deductions
and
business
deductions,
deductions
for
the
production
of
income
in
the
other
state.
my
reservation
comes
for
this
reason.
you
also
suggested,
and
i
thought
with
some
cogency,
that
because
new
york
takes
into
consideration
worldwide
income
when
the
rate
is
set,
therefore,
new
york
ought
to
take
into
consideration
worldwide
deductions.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
income,
the
worldwide
income
that
new
york
takes
into
consideration
includes
business
income,
i
assume.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
therefore,
if
we
were
to
adopt
what
i
suggested
might
be
a
cogent
rationale,
i
think
we've
got
to
go
the
whole
hog,
and
i
think
we've
got
to
say,
whatever
is
related
to
the
production
of
any
income,
or
whatever
would
be
appropriate
as
a
deduction
from
any
income,
must
be
allowed
in
new
york
pro
tanto.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
there's
the
countervailing
consideration,
isn't
there,
in
the
fact
pointed
out
by
your
brother
that
alimony
is
characteristically
assessed
on
the
basis
of
total
income,
and
therefore
there
is
a
very
strong
relationship
between
the
amount
of
alimony
ordered
and
income
earned
in
new
york.
