mr.
lunding,
let
me
ask
you
about
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
i
had
always
thought
of
alimony
as
an
income-splitting
between
the
payor
and
the
ex-spouse.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
i
could
see,
if
you
were
presenting
us
with
a
situation
where
what...
new
york
lets
you
deduct
the
tax
to
your
ex-spouse
so
that
new
york
gets
the
tax
on
that
amount
of
money
that
you
earned
in
new
york,
but
you
would
like
to
take
the
deduction
while
on
the
income
side,
if
there
is
any
income,
it
is
to
the
exspouse,
who
is
a
connecticut
residence,
so
it
seems
to
me
you
say,
let
me
take
the
sweet
and
new
york
will
be
stuck
with
the
bitter.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
the
federal
union
that's
fine,
because
the
irs
is
going
to
get
it
either
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
husband
or
the
wife,
it
could
be,
deducts
it,
and
the
one
who
receives
it
pays
income
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
when
you're
in
one
state
and
you're
dealing
with
nonresidents,
in
the
generality
of
cases
if
you
have
a
marital
situation
it's
in
the
state
of
their
residence.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
one
state
is
going
to
get
the
income
to
tax,
the
other
state
is
not
going
to
get
that
tax,
so
there
seems
an
imbalance
there,
and
my
only
question
is,
why
is
it
a
violation
of
privileges
and
immunities
to
say
that
when
new
york
doesn't
get
the
chance
to
tax
the
one
who's
getting
the
money,
getting
the
alimony,
it
shouldn't
have
to
give
a
deduction
to
the
one
who's
paying
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
deduct
if
connecticut
has
an
income
tax?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
the
year
in
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
ordinarily,
if
a
state
has
an
income
tax,
the
resident
state,
you
could
then
deduct
the
new
york
tax
from
the
connecticut
tax.
i'm
just
trying
to
see
how
much
in
practice
is
left
when
you
take
into
account,
well,
you
have
to
pay
new
york
more,
but
then
you
got
a
bigger
deduction
in
your
home
state.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
in
figuring
the
level
of
discrimination,
do
we
take
account
at
all
of
the
tax
that's
being
paid
on
these
funds
by
the
connecticut
resident
who's
receiving
them?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
didn't
know
you
could
sue
for
a
refund
or...
in
the
federal
system
either
in
a
class
action
capacity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
generally
the
rule
with
respect
to
challenges?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
oh,
this
court
has
said
that
in
a
number
of
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
let
me
just
be
clear,
because
you
do
have
to,
if
you're
invoking
privileges
and
immunities,
give
us
some
kind
of
principle.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
you...
you
are
candidly
saying
yes,
anything
that's
personal,
including
your
medical
expenses,
including
what
could
be
ambiguous
in
some
cases
like
life
insurance,
whether
it's
to
protect
the
business
or
to
protect
the
individual,
but
all
of
those
you
have
to
be
treated
just
like
a
resident.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
was
that
portion,
because
that's
been
a
little
fuzzy
to
me.
i
know
what
they
held
about
the
exemptions,
that
you
have
to
give
the
out-of-stater
the
same
personal
exemption,
but
what
is
the
part
that
you
were
relying
on?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
it
hypothetical,
or
was
there
something
in
the
case,
that
this
taxpayer
said,
i
want
a
deduction
for
my
real
property
tax
or
my
life
insurance
premium
and
they're
not
giving
it
to
me?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
say
personal
deductions,
so
i
gather
that
you
are
making
the
distinction
between
expenses
for
the
production
of
income
and
personal
expenses,
and
you
are
not
relying
to
any
extent
on
the
peculiarity
of
alimony,
that
it
is
a
two-way
thing,
one
gets
a
deduction,
the
other
gets
income.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
like
the
sole,
or
whatever,
so...
but
you're
not...
i
would
just
like
to
be
clear
on
getting
a
factor
out
of
my
head
if
it
shouldn't
be
there,
that
is
that
the
spouse
who
receives
the
alimony
would
be
paying
the
state
in
which
he
resides
income
on
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
now
you
are
going
back
when
you
say
it
does
count
that
most
often
the
spouse
will
be
in
the
other
state,
so
that
you
are
not
allowing
the
deduction,
but
on
the
other
hand,
you're
not
getting
your
hands
on
the
income
to
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even--
--why
did
new
york
change
in
1987?
you
said
they
had
the
other
rule
where
they
allowed
the
same
deductions,
personal
deductions,
and
then
they
changed.
what
prompted
the
change?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
know
how
many
states
do
it
the
way
new
york
is
currently
doing
it?
