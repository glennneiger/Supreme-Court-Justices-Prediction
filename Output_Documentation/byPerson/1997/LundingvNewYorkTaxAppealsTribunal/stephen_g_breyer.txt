what
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
top
rate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
absolute
equality
of
treatment,
i
found
it
awfully
easy
to
construct
bizarre
examples.
that
is,
i
just
imagined
a
person
at
$100,000
income,
all
out
of
new
york,
and
$50,000
alimony,
and
all
you
have
to
do
is,
you
multiply
by
4
percent,
and
that
person
is
paying,
what,
4
percent
times
50,000
i
guess
is
$2,000,
and
then
apply
your
formula,
and
your
formula
will
be
[dollar]s
100,000,
the
total
income,
over
federal,
minus
the
alimony,
which
will
be
50,
so
you
get
a
multiple
of
2,
and
so
you
have
the
new
york
person
paying
2,000,
the
connecticut
person
paying
4,000.
and
if,
by
the
way,
the
person
had
a
bad
year,
and
his
income
went
down
to
where
it
was
close
to
the
judicial
decree
for
alimony,
suppose
he
had
100,000,
his
alimony
was
90,
you're
going
to
get
results
that
are
going
to
be
phenomenal.
i
mean,
what
will
happen
is
the
new
york
person
on
[dollars]
1,000
will
pay...
let's
say,
if
it's
10
percent,
they
pay
1,000.
you'd
have
to
multiply
by
a
multiple
of
10,
and
you
would
discover
that
the
connecticut
resident
has
a
$10,000
tax
in
new
york,
or
if
it's
8
percent,
$8,000,
and
his
real
income
is
10,000.
am
i
wrong
in
those?
i
mean,
i
just...
all
i
did
was
apply
the
formula,
you
know.
i
took
the
formula.
it
says,
he
has
[dollars]
100,000,
he
has
90,000
alimony.
for
new
york
purposes,
he
has
[dollars]
10,000
income.
he
pays,
let's
say,
8
percent,
or
10
percent.
that's
[dollars]
1,000.
then
it
says
you're
supposed
to
take
the
new
york
total,
which
is
[dollars]
100,000,
right,
and
then
you
have
in
the...
that's
the
denominator,
his
federal,
but
not
counting
alimony,
so
that's
10.
so
100
is
10
x
10,
so
you
multiply
10
times
the
new
york
tax,
and
you
discover
you've
got
[dollars]
10,000
in
tax.
wow.
i
mean,
i
could
create,
you
know,
worse
ones,
or
i
suppose
there
are
a
lot
of
better
ones,
but
it
seemed
to
me
that
it
was
pretty
easy
to
create
odd
examples,
and...
which
seem
very
unfair.
now,
am
i
wrong
about
the
ease
of
doing
that,
or
is
there
some
justification
for
that,
or
is
it
just
bizarre
that
a
person
would
have,
say,
half
his
income
in
alimony
and
yet
all
of
his
income
out
of
new
york,
or
that
he
could
have
a
bad
year,
or
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
my
examples
were
meant
to
be
quite
ordinary,
most
of
them.
i
mean,
the
one
that
they
have
100
percent
in
new
york,
then
you
get
the
odd
rate.
but
whether
it's
those
examples
or
the...
you
know,
the
unusual
ones
you
can
construct
with
the
generous
person,
you
had
two
justifications,
because
you've
said
twofold
several
times,
and
i've
heard
one,
and
i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not
a
constitutional
point,
so
any
constitutional
holding
that
permitted
you
to
do
what
you've
done
here
would
permit
justice
stevens'
hypothetical.
all
it
would
take
would
be
a
federal
statute
that
does
the
same
thing
that
this
statute
did
here.
a
delegation
imposes...
you
know,
convinces
the
other
members
of
congress
to
write
a
little
thing
which
says
that
new
york-source
alimony
is
not...
you
know,
the
way
they
did
it
here,
they'd
do
the
same
thing
for
charities.
they
could
do
the
same
thing
for
anything,
so
it
would
be
easy
under
the
constitution
to
replicate
just
that
problem,
wouldn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
what's
worrying
me.
of
course,
if
it's
constitutionally
permissible
to
do
this,
the
states
that
are
always
anxious
to
get
more
money
could
think
of,
you
know,
dozens
and
dozens
of
ways
to
produce
the
kinds
of
results
that
we
were
talking
about.
