rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1462,
christopher
h.
lunding
v.
the
new
york
tax
appeals
tribunal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what,
9,000
feet
would
be
roughly,
what,
2--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
but...
okay.
okay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
couldn't
you
say,
too,
that
you
couldn't
afford
a
very
nice
house
in
connecticut
which
perhaps
you
have
if
you
didn't
make
a
good
deal
of
money
in
new
york,
and
therefore
that
new
york
ought
to
allow
your
property
tax
in
connecticut
to
be
deducted?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
an
income
transfer
that
can
be
very
beneficial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
discriminate,
you
mean
treat
differently,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
it
true,
mr.
lunding,
that
the
standards
by
which
tax
law
classifications
are
judged
are
about
the
most
generous
known
to
the
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
several
of
our
cases
say
that.
perhaps
not
in
the
privileges
and
immunities
clause
kind,
but
just
in
the
sense
of
classification
generally
for
tax
laws.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--there's
a
total
latitude
if
it
doesn't
violate
the
federal
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you...
thank
you,
mr.
lunding.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
bing,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bing.
the
case
is
submitted.
