mr.
lunding--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
hate
to
think
we're
going
to
have
to
go
through
state
deductions
one
by
one
in
order...
in
case
after
case
in
order
to
decide
which
must
be
allowed
to
out-of-staters
and
which
need
not
be.
what
is
your
criterion
for
whether
it
must
or
need
not
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
all
we
do,
then
we're
going
to
have
another
case
on
the
next
item,
and
another
case
on
the
next
item.
i
want
a
principle.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
are
nonpersonal
deductions?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
wait
a
minute--
justice
antonin
scalia
--surely
that
would
be
an
unfair
rule,
because
new
york
takes
into
account
out-of-state
income--
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
purposes
of
what
rate
you
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
does
not
tax
you
on
that
out-of-state
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
would
certainly
be
unfair
to
let
you
get
dollar-for-dollar
deductions
on
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
you
don't
do
that
for
new
yorkers.
you
allow
new
yorkers
to
do
that
stuff.
it
is
not
incurred
in
the
generation
of
the
new
york
income.
you
give
them
all
sorts
of
personal
deductions.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
justification
is
there
for
not
allowing
the
same
treatment
to
the
out-of-staters?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
if
you're
looking
at
all
his
income
for
purposes
of
taxes,
you're
entitled
to
give
him
all
deductions
of
any
sort,
but
these
people,
since
they're
out-of-staters
and
you're
not
looking
at
all
of
their
income,
except
as
to
the
rate,
and
therefore
you
don't
have
to
give
them
all
of
the
deductions.
i
guess
there's
a
certain
parallelism
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he's
not
asking
for
the
entirety
of
the
deduction.
he's
only
asking
for
a
percentage
of
the
deduction
that
is
equivalent
to
the
percentage
of
his
total
income
which
consists
of
new
york
income.
i
mean,
your
answer
would
be
a
good
one
if
he
was
coming
in
and
saying,
give
me
a
full
deduction,
and
you
say,
well,
we
can't
tax
you
on
your
out-of-state
and
therefore
we
don't
have
to
give
you
a
deduction.
but
he's
saying,
don't
give
me
the
whole
deduction.
just
give
me
the
same
percentage
that
i...
you
know,
that
new
york
income
constitutes
of
my
total
income.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
you
could
allow...
i
could
see
your
allowing
a
deduction
for
contributions
to
new
york
charities
that
are
not
allowed
for
deductions
to
out-of-state
charities,
or
maybe
allowing
a
deduction
for
payment
of
county
or
municipal
taxes
in
new
york
only,
and
not
out
of
state.
i
can
see
some
policy
justification
for
that.
but
you're
not
giving
me
any
policy
justification,
just
sort
of
a
yah,
yah,
yah
argument.
we
do
it
because
we
can
do
it,
that's
why.
i
mean,
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
a
policy
justification.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
aren't
those
personal
expenses...
i
mean,
if
20
percent
of
your
income
is
from
new
york,
why
isn't
20
percent
of
those
personal
expenses
fairly
attributable
to
new
york
income?
i
mean,
you're
sort
of
adopting
the
premise
that
all
of
your
personal
expenses
come
from
non-new
york
state
income.
that
seems
to
me
an
unreasonable
premise.
