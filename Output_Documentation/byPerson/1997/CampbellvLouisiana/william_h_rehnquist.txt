chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1584,
terry
campbell
v.
louisiana.
mr.
burnes,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
foreperson
of
a
grand
jury
do
in
louisiana?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
he
cast
a
vote
himself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
hobby
how
was
the
foreman
chosen?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
that
different?
why
is
that
different
from
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
hobby
it
was
the
same
objection,
wasn't
it?
the
foreman
or
foreperson
was
always
white.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
choice
was
just
made
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
by
people
already
chosen.
i
mean,
the
discrimination
is
still
there.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
burnes,
if
you
wanted
to
bring
that
issue
here
you're
obligated
to
put
it
in
your
question
presented,
i
think,
as
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out.
you
have
three
subdivisions
and
every
one
of
them
is
limited
to
standing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fairly
subsumed,
i
think.
i
think
that
means
that
the
general...
that
the
language
of
the
question
includes
something
that
perhaps
is
lesser,
or...
but
it
seems
to
me
standing
and
remedy
are
two
very
distinct
things.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
burnes.
general
ieyoub,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.--
--that
still
doesn't
his
power
is
just
ministerial,
unless
you
were
to
say
that
his
power
as
foreman
is
ministerial
but
he
has
every
bit
as
much
power
as
any
other
grand
juror
in
voting
on
indictments.
that's
correct,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
general
ieyoub.
mr.
burnes,
you
have
8
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
in
the
mechanic
case
in
the
federal
courts
we
held
that
even
though
a
federal
grand
jury
does
not
conform
to
the
requirements
set
up
by
congress,
nonetheless,
if
the
person
is
convicted,
the
shortcomings
of
the
grand
jury
are
harmless
error.
why
doesn't
the
same
thing
follow
in
this
situation
insofar
as
your
due
process
claim
is
concerned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
those
are
not
due
process
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
not
impartial
that
suggests
that
some
members
of
the
grand
jury
were
prejudiced
against
your
client.
now,
there's
no
evidence
of
that,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
was
an
equal
protection
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
just
melding
together
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
due
process
clause,
it
seems
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--3-3-3,
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
burnes.
the
case
is
submitted.
