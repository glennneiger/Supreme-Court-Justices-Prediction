justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then
it's
not
a
problem.
i
mean,
he
just
wants
to
have
standing
so
he
can
make
the
claim.
then
you'd
prove
it
out,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you'd
say
there
wasn't,
and
he'd
say
there
was,
so
we'd
have
an
argument.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just
have
one
other
quick
thing
that
you
had
in
your
brief.
it
says
that...
when
you
say...
you
said
it
was...
the
grand
jury
foreman's
role
is
ministerial,
but
it
says
in
your
brief
that
the
grand
jury
may
determine
rules
of
procedure.
what
does
that
mean,
may
determine
rules
of
procedure?
if
you
have
the
power
to
determine
rules
of
procedure,
that's
an
enormously
important
power.
i
mean,
can...
what
does
that
involve?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
wouldn't
it?
i
mean,
why
isn't
there...
you
say
that
a
white
person
has
standing
to
say
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
me
was
too
white.
that's
right.
you
concede
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
white
person
can
say
there
weren't
enough
black
people
on
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
me.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
concede
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
somebody
says,
fine,
that's
my
claim.
my
claim
is,
if
even
one
position
was
always
white,
then
there
were
not
enough
black
people
on
the
grand
jury
that
indicted
me,
so
how
could
a
person
have
standing
to
make
the
first
argument
but
not
have
standing
to
make
the
second
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--since
the
second
argument
is
the
first
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
you
would
win
on
the
merits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
why
would
the
person
not
have
standing
to
argue
that
systematically
discriminating
in
one
position--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--creates
as
bad
a
grand
jury
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
constitution,
or
nearly
as
bad
as
discriminating
in
eight
or
nine
or
ten
or
three
or
four?
i
would
like
to
make
the
argument
that
constitutionally
speaking
those
things
are
equivalent,
or
just
about
as
bad,
or
wrong
in
any
event.
can't
he
at
least
make
that
argument?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
guess
it's
the
case,
isn't
it...
i
mean,
suppose
a
judge
or
the
system
deliberately
excluded
blacks
from
position
number
4.
position
number
4
was
always
white.
that's
illegal,
isn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
pure
racial
discrimination.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
it's...
they
exclude
blacks
always
from
5,
6,
and
7
as
well,
then
the
white
person
has
standing,
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
9,
10,
11...
4,
5,
6,
7,
8,
9,
and
10.
now,
does
the
white
person
have
standing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
all
right.
now,
what's
your
theory
under
which
the
white
person
has
the
standing
if
it's
4,
5,
6,
7,
8,
9,
and
10
but
it's
not
1?
they're
both
illegal.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they're
both
grand
juries,
they're
both...
i
mean,
that's
i
think
what
people
have
been
trying
to
get
at.
what
would
the
theory
of
the
thing
be?
