mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
petitioner
terry
campbell
has
been
improperly
denied
standing
to
raise
the
equal
protection,
due
process,
and
sixth
amendment
fair
crosssection
objections
to
the
grand
jury
which
indicted
him.
despite
the
acknowledged
and
undisputed
de
facto
racial
discrimination
practiced
against
african
americans
in
evangeline
parish,
petitioner
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
object
solely
because
he
is
white.
the
case
is
about
race,
and
the
case
is
about
racial
discrimination.
the
case
is
about
petitioner's
equal
protection,
due
process,
and
sixth
amendment
claims.
the
case
is
not
about
gender,
retroactive
application
to
other
cases,
or
overturning
hobby.
the
facts
in
the
case
are
simple
and
undisputed.
number
1,
african
americans
were
not
being
selected
as
grand
jury
forepersons
and
number
2,
petitioner
was
prevented
from
objecting
to
number
1
solely
because
he
is
white.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
i
would
not
know
past
the
evidence
presented
to
the
trial
court.
for
the
period
of
evidence
presented
to
the
trial
court
there
was
never
a
black
selected.
i
don't
know
historically,
back
through
the
louisiana
purchase--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--a
16-1/2
year
time
period
during
which
generally
there
are
supposed
to
be
two
grand
juries
selected
each
year.
one
year
i
believe
there
was
only
one
grand
jury
selected,
so
it
was
a
string
of
35
consecutive
white
grand
jury
forepersons.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
i
believe
there
is,
your
honor.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
i
would
not
know
that.
i
haven't
looked
into
that,
your
honor.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
there
have
been
cases
brought
up
in
a
lot
of
the
parishes
in
louisiana,
in
sabine
parish,
i
believe
in
lafayette
parish
and
lake
charles.
i
don't
have
a
list
of
exactly
which
parishes,
but
i
know
that
this
has
been
brought
up
in
a
lot
of
the
parishes
there.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
the
issue
of
nonselection
of
whites
to
the
grand
jury--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--to
a
greater
or
lesser
extent,
yes,
sir.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
fair
crosssection,
sixth
amendment
fair
crosssection
claims,
generally--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--you're
right,
your
honor,
in
prior
courts...
in
prior
cases
this
court
has
found
problems
in
applying
fair
crosssection
to
a
single
person.
the
court
has
concentrated
on
groups
that
the
fair
crosssection
applies
to.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
oh,
yes,
your
honor,
definitely.
in
fact,
there
are--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--yes,
your
honor.
in
fact,
there
are
two
groups
that
the
fair
crosssection
claim
can
be
focused
upon.
one
is
a
grand
jury
group
as
a
whole.
you
have
a
grand
jury
where
11
of
them
are
chose
randomly
and
fairly,
we
would
submit,
and
then
the
twelfth
member
is
chosen
unfairly,
always
chosen
as
a
white
person.
that's
going
to
distort
that
group.
you
don't
have
the
fair
crosssection
in
the
grand
jury
itself.
but
even
more
importantly,
the...
if
you
look
at
the
grand
jury
venire,
the
approximately
300
people
called
to
court
that
day
whose
names
are
going
to
be
drawn
and
placed
on
the
grand
jury,
the
judge
gets
to
the
point
where
he
selects
the
grand
jury
foreman,
and
you
no
longer
have
the
representative
crosssection
sitting
up
there.
you
only
have
the
white
people
sitting
in
the
room
that
the
judge
selects
from.
that
effective
grand
jury
venire--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--your
honor,
i'm
not
100-percent
sure
about
the
number
of
300.
a
large
number
of
people
are
called,
given
summons
to
show
up
for
jury
duty.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
your
honor,
that's
the
way
the
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure
article
413
reads.
the
judge...
i
don't
know
that
the
code
article
specifically
means
that
he
has
to
make
his
selection
before
the
other
ones
are
chosen.
when
i
looked
through
the
minutes
for
the
past
16-1/2
years,
generally
they
seemed
to
indicate
that
the
12...
the
11
were
drawn
at
random
and
then
the
judge
selected
someone
else
sitting
in
there,
and
again
occasionally
minutes
are
entered
very
loosely
or
just
from
a
form,
so
i
don't
know
if
that
does
mean
he
was
first
or
second
on
that.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
your
honor,
that
is
pointed
out
in
the
state's
brief
at
page
26.
the
statutory
provisions
provide
that
the
foreman
shall
preside
over
all
hearings,
may
delegate
duties
to
other
grand
jurors,
and
may
determine
rules
or
procedures.
this
basically
means
that
he
leads
the
discussions,
he
decides
when
to
vote,
how
to
vote,
and
what
to
vote
on.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
oh,
yes,
he
does.
he
is
one
of
the
12
voting
members
of
the
grand
jury,
and
that
is--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--i
don't
think
the
state
was
trying
to
mislead.
i
think
the
state
was
at
that
point
in
26
attempting
to
show
some
of
the
other
powers
of
the
grand
jury
foreman--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--and
that
i
believe
is
the
very
important
fact
in
here.
petitioner
campbell
takes
the
position
that
this...
this
court
has
had
previous
cases
saying
you
cannot
pick
a
grand
jury
unfairly.
here,
one
voting
member
of
the
grand
jury
is
picked
unfairly.
petitioner
campbell
has
equal...
has
raised
equal
protection--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--in
the
hobby
case--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--the
basic
difference
is,
in
the
hobby
case
a
grand
jury,
the
entire
grand
jury
is
selected
in
a
fair
manner
and
then
that
one
person,
the
grand
jury
foreman,
is
given
the
job
of
doing
the
clerk
duties
for
the
grand
jury,
but
the
point
is
that
whole
grand
jury
was
chosen
in
a
fair
manner.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
i
believe
he
was
chosen
by
the
judge,
your
honor.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
it's
different
because
the
judge
is
looking
at
the
grand
jury,
the
entire
grand
jury
panel
who
was
chosen
in
a
fair
fashion.
in
louisiana,
11/12ths
of
the
grand
jury
is
chosen
in
a
fair
fashion
and
then
the
grand
jury
foreman
is
chosen
not
from
the
panel
but
from
the
venire
sitting
out
there,
and
that
choice
is
made
in
a
discriminatory
fashion.
that
choice
is
always
made
for
a
white
grand
jury
foreperson.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
the
objection...
yes,
the
objection
was
that
the
foreperson
was
always
white.
the
objection
here
is
that
the
foreperson
was
always
white,
but
here
it's
that
the
voting
member
was
chosen
in
a
discriminatory
manner
to
sit
on
the
grand
jury.
in
hobby,
there
was
no
voting
member
chosen
in
a
discriminatory
fashion
to
sit
on
the
grand
jury.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
oh,
there
is
a
discrimination
and
at
that
point
you
would
look
to...
and
hobby
focused
on
what
is
the
harm
that
is
going
to
come
from
this.
i
don't
think
hobby
said
there
was
never...
the
opinion
in
hobby
said
there
was
never
any
discrimination.
it
said
there
was.
but
then
when
you
stop
and
you
look,
you
don't
find
a
due
process
harm
involved
there.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
on
the
remedy.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
well,
we
would--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--we
would
submit
that
remedy
is
implicated
and
that
standing
is
implicated.
standing
was
the
issues
cited,
or
the
questions
presented
in
the
writ
for
petition.
however,
this
court's
rules
do
say
that
all
questions
fairly
subsumed
are
also
included
and
here
we
have...
if
we
were
sitting
now
before
the
trial
and
it
hadn't
gone
forward,
this
case...
this
court
would
probably
only
be
looking
at
standing,
but
the
case
has
gone
forward.
petitioner
campbell
has
been
convicted
and
sentenced
to
a
life
sentence,
simply
because
of
the
time
delays
of
getting
through
the
courts,
so
now--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--your
honor,
the
questions
do--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--your
honor,
we
do
need
to
have
rulings
from
this
court
on
standing.
once
this
court
does
rule
on
standing
the
question
is,
then
what?
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
well,
your
honor,
that's--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--your
honor,
that
is
one
option
open
to
this
court.
another--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--well,
of
course,
the
hobby
case,
your
honor,
the
conviction
was
not
set
aside.
in
rose
v.
mitchell,
a
leading
case
in
this
area,
the
petitioner,
this
court
held
that
the
petitioner
failed
to
prove
his
prima
facie
case
and
did
not
set
aside
the
conviction,
so
there
are
cases,
there
are
times
when
this
court
may
find
standing,
may
find
a
right,
may
even
find
a
remedy--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--conceivably
the
court
could
take
that
opinion.
however,
the
facts
here
are
very
clear.
they've
never
been
disputed.
there
are
multiple
places
in
the
record
where
the
judge
repeatedly
says,
we
all
know
what
happened
here.
we
all
know
blacks
haven't
been
chosen.
at
the
actual
hearing
on
the
motion
to
quash
the
judge
allowed
mr.
campbell's
thenattorney
to
present
a
prima
facie
case.
he
then
turned
to
the
state
and
said,
now
let's
here
from
you,
what
do
you
have
to
say
to
it,
basically.
the
state
then
only
argued
on
standing,
never
made
any
rebuttal
with
respect
to
that
prima
facie
case,
even--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--and
again,
your
honor,
those...
the
questions
do
raise
the
issue
of
standing,
which
has
been
a
roadblock
in
this
case.
this
court
also
has
rules
that
any
question
is
fairly
derived...
and
i
don't
remember
the
exact
statement,
fairly
derived
from
those
questions,
subsumed--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--your
honor
is
correct,
standing
and
remedy
are
distinct.
in
this
case,
mr.
campbell
has
been
denied
the
standing
on
the
equal
protection
claims,
on
the
due
process
and
sixth
amendment
fair
crosssection
claims.
this
court,
if
it
rules
that
mr.
campbell
has
standing
on
any
or
all
of
those,
it
is
then
faced
with
the
question,
does
it
go
forward
and
say
what
the
remedy
in
this
case
is,
or
does
it
not.
we
believe
that
this
case
in
the
record
shows
that
there
has
been
evidence
put
on
for
the
prima
facie
case.
the
state's
been
offered
a
chance
to
rebut
and
has
not.
we
believe
the
case
at
this
point
is
just
turning
on
the
remedy
then.
i
would
like
to
make
it
clear
that
mr.
campbell
has
raised
equal
protection
claims.
there's
the
bare,
straightforward
claim.
why
can
i,
terry
campbell,
a
white
man,
be
indicted
by
this
illegal
grand
jury
when
a
black
man
cannot?
that's
the
dominant
feature
of
this
case,
and
that's
how
it's
really
been
viewed
by
most
of
louisiana
courts.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
yes.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
haven't
had
a
chance
to
say
it
yet,
but
the
equal
protection
claim
has
that
bare
naive
claim
i
just
mentioned
and
also
has
the
more
sophisticated
third
party
standing.
if
you
look
in
the
appendix--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--the
bare,
or
naive
equal
protection
claim.
why
can
i,
a
white
man,
be
indicted
by
this
illegal
grand
jury?
that's
just
a
straightforward
equal
protection
claim.
why
does
a
black
man
have
protection
from
being
indicted
by
this
unconstitutionally
selected
grand
jury
but
i,
a
white
man,
don't
have
protection
from
being
indicted
by
this--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
the
second
part,
the
more
sophisticated
equal
protection
claim
that
comes
under
the
powers
third
party
standing,
that
mr.
campbell
is
in
a
position
to
adequately
put
forth
their
rights,
all
of
the
analysis
that
was
in
the
powers
case,
that
he
has
a
relationship
with
the
excluded
jurors,
so--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--in
the--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--it
is
a
standing
question,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
way
the
trial
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
have
ruled,
is
that
mr.
campbell
did
not
have
standing
to
raise--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--well,
the
cases
in
the
past,
your
honor,
have
held
that,
for
instance
in
batson,
on
a
preemptory
challenge,
it
doesn't
matter
whether
the
defendant
is
black
or
white.
they
can
object...
they
have
a
standing
to
object
to
the
discrimination
question.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
your
honor,
i'm--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--perhaps
the
reason
i'm
arguing
this
way
is
because
the
trial
courts
and
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
louisiana
have
couched
their
rulings
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
mr.
campbell,
you
are
a
white
man
accused
of
killing
a
white
man,
therefore
you
don't
have
standing
to
raise
this
claim
or
that
claim
or
the
other
claim,
and--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--that...
and
i
believe
in
this
case
mr.
campbell
has
a
right
to
raise
the
equal
protection
claim.
part
of
the
reason
i'm
arguing
this
way
is
also
that
the
state's
brief
has
attacked
whether
there's
article
iii
standing.
i
believe
in
this
bare
claim
that
there's
article
iii
standing,
there's
an
injury,
there's
causation,
there's
redressability.
in
the
sophisticated...
what
i
call
the
sophisticated
equal
protection
claim
there
is
the
third
party
standing
and
the
due
process,
i
think
there's
article
iii
standing.
in
the
sixth
amendment
claim
there's
article
iii
standing.
that
is
why
i'm
explaining
the
claims
somewhat,
is
to
show
how
they
fit
within
the
standing
requirements
of
article
iii
and
the
exceptions
for
third
party
standing
as
in
powers.
your
honors,
i'd
also
like
to
direct
your
attention,
if
i
could,
to
the
state's
brief.
the
state
in
its
brief
does
agree
in
some
forms
with
the
petitioner
campbell's
claims
on
all
three
grounds.
with
respect
to
the
equal
protection
ground,
at
page
22,
note
9,
the
state
of
louisiana
recognizes
this
court's
decision
that
if
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
itself
occurs,
the
proper
remedy
is
reversal
of
the
subsequent
conviction,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
there
was
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
itself.
grand
juror
number
12
was
chosen
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
with
respect
to
the
due
process
claim
on
page
26
and
note
12,
in
guice
2
the
fifth
circuit
noted
that
because
the
foreman
in
louisiana
is
selected
from
the
venire
rather
from
the
grand
jury
itself,
any
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
a
foreman
necessarily
taints
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
as
well.
only
11
of
its
12
members
were
chosen
at
random.
if
that
is
so,
the
petitioner
may
obtain
relief
by
challenging
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury,
and
this
he
has
failed
to
do.
but,
in
fact,
that
is
what
mr.
campbell
has
been
doing
from
the
beginning.
he's
been
saying
that
this
twelfth
member
of
the
grand
jury
was
chosen
in
a
discriminatory
manner,
has
always
been
chosen
white.
and
on
page
30,
under
the
b
heading
with
respect
to
the
sixth
amendment
argument,
the
state
writes,
if
this
court
decides
that
the
sixth
amendment
itself
is
implicated
regardless
of
whether
the
judicial
body
at
issue
is
the
grand
jury
or
just
the
grand
jury
foreman,
then
the
state
concedes
that
under
holland
v.
illinois
petitioner
has
standing
to
assert
a
sixth
amendment
challenge.
it's
the
law,
the
constitution
and
its
amendments
and
the
prior
decisions
of
this
court,
that
have
forced
the
state
to
make
concessions
on
these
issues.
in
the
dissent
by
justice
scalia,
to
which
chief
justice
rehnquist
joined
in
the
case
of
powers
v.
ohio,
there's
a
statement.
it
would
be
absurd
to...
and
this
is
at
page
1379
in
the
supreme
court
recorder
111.
it
would
be
absurd
to
suppose
that
a
black
juror
has
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
through
peremptory
strike
in
the
trial
of
a
black
defendant
but
not
in
the
trial
of
a
white
defendant.
however,
this
is
the
absurd
position
the
state
has
taken.
an
african
american
prospective
grand
juror
has
a
right
not
to
be
discriminated
against
in
the
selection
of
the
grand
jury
foreperson
in
cases
involving
black
defendants
but
not
in
cases
involving
white
defendants.
in
its
conclusion
to
its
brief
in
page
34
the
state
says,
louisiana
in
no
way
condones
race
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
in
any
corner.
however,
the
state's
presence
here
today
shows
otherwise.
this
court
has
the
opportunity
and
has
the
power
to
correct
the
racial
discrimination
in
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
which
is
currently
accepted
in
and
by
the
state
of
louisiana.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
may
it
please
the
court--
i
would
like
to
address
a
few
of
the
points
raised
by
general
ieyoub.
the
injury
here,
the
harm
involved
when
you're
looking
at
the
claims
which
would
fall
under
article
iii
standing,
is
the
right
not
to
be
indicted
by
a
nonimpartial
grand
jury.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
that
he
was
denied
the
opportunity
to
have
an
impartial
grand
jury
look
at
the
evidence
presented
to
that
grand
jury
and
say,
we're
only
going
to
indict
him
for
manslaughter,
or
we're
not
even
going
to
indict
him
at
all.
that
is
a
right
that
the
citizens
have.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
mr.
campbell
was
convicted.
however,
he
has
the
right
to
have
the
grand
jury
look
at
the
evidence
and
say,
we're
only
going
to
indict
for
manslaughter.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
your
honor,
we
aren't
arguing
that
the
conviction
was
fundamentally
unfair.
we
are
arguing
that
he
was
denied
his
rights
at
that
grand
jury
stage.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
your
honor,
there's...
because
the
long
line
of
cases
from
this
court
which
find
that
racial
discrimination
at
the
grand
jury--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--well,
with
respect
to
the
due
process,
i
believe
there
is
a
due
process
harm
there
when,
in
order
to
be
convicted
and
sentenced
to
a
life
sentence
in
louisiana,
the
citizen
has
a
right
to
the
indictment
by
the
grand
jury
and
the
grand
jury
here
was
not
impartial,
did
not
have...
he
was
not--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--well,
as--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--your
honor,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
of
that
and
you
can't
see
the
evidence
in
the
record
of
that
and
that's
pointed
out
very
clearly
in
the
vasquez
v.
hillery
case,
where--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--which
says
that
you
cannot
determine--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--well,
your
honor,
the
analysis,
the
argument
right
there
that
you
cannot
tell
what
the
harm
is
because
you're
not
allowed
to
look
at
those
deliberations
and
look
at
those
votes
is
equally
as
strong
in
the
due
process
area
as
in
the
equal
protection
area.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
your
honor,
that's
where
we
would
disagree
with
your
honor,
that--
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
--peters
v.
kiff,
your
honor,
is
a
case
involving
i
believe
petit
juries.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
and
extended
to
grand
juries.
here,
the
harm
is
that
he's
not
given
a
chance
for
the
grand
jury
to
say,
you
know,
this
defendant
may
or
may
not
have
done
that,
we're
going
to
only
find
for
manslaughter,
and
not
subject
him
to
that
life
sentence.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
i
don't
recall,
your
honor.
mr.
dmitrc
i.
burnes
okay.
your
honor,
i'd
like
to...
your
honors,
i'd
like
to
address
a
few
more
issues.
one
is
that
general
ieyoub
raised
the
point
that
only
9
votes
were
needed
by
the
grand
jury
again
on
that
case
that
would
seem
to
be
urging
an
issue,
urging
a
rule
that
we
could
discriminate
on
3
out
of
the
12
grand
jury
members,
still
get
9
votes
from
the
other
ones
and
have
a
valid
indictment.
i
don't
believe
that
is
a
good
rule.
general
ieyoub
has
also
argued
that
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
said
that
the
grand
jury
foreman
is
ministerial,
but
you
have
to
look
at
where
the
grand
jury...
where
the
louisiana
supreme
court
said
that.
that
was
in
this
case
which
is
under
review
here.
the
problem
here
that
there
was
systematic
exclusion
by
the
judge
and
that
petitioner
campbell
has
been
denied
standing
to
raise
these
claims.
whenever
the
state
has
argued
against
it
they
start
going
to
the
merits
of
the
claims.
they
start
saying
how
he's
got
to
prove
this
or
prove
that
with
respect
to
due
process,
yet
petitioner
campbell
isn't
given
an
opportunity
to
prove
whether
there
was
a
due
process
violation
or
an
equal
protection
violation
or
a
sixth
amendment
violation
when
he's
not
given
standing
to
assert
them.
if
there's
no
other
questions,
i'd
yield
my
time.
