justice

bader

is
it
true
that
there's
never
been
a
nonwhite
foreman
in
evangeline
county?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
saying
from
the
years...
what
time
frame
are
we
talking
about
that
there
has
been
no
nonwhite?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
a
difference
in
the
way
the
foreperson
is
selected
in
new
orleans,
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
the
experience
any
different
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
don't
know
whether
evangeline
county
is
unique
in
louisiana
or
represents
the
general
way
things
are--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
burnes,
going
back
from
peters
v.
kiff
on,
in
any
case
where
this
court
allowed
someone
to
challenge
as
discriminatory
the
selection
of
the
petit
jury
or
the
grand
jury,
in
any
one
of
those
cases,
has
the
result
ever
been
anything
other
than
the
conviction
got
set
aside?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
might...
conceivably
in
this
case
if
standing
were
recognized
the
court
could
say,
but
you
haven't
shown
that
there
was,
in
fact,
discrimination
in
the
selection
of
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
understand
what
you...
has
the
bare
what
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
also
raising...
urging
that
the...
campbell
has
standing
to
raise
the
denial
of
equal
protection
to
the
nonwhite
who
might
have
been
selected?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
ieyoub,
you
don't
dispute,
do
you
the
figures
that
were
presented
that
for
the
last
16
years
there's
never
been
a
nonwhite
grand
jury
foreperson
in
evangeline
county?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
wouldn't
matter
what
went
on
in
other
counties.
except
for...
there's
a
curiosity
in
louisiana
law,
and
i'm
sure
you
can
tell
me
why
this
is
so.
it
doesn't
work
that
way
in
new
orleans.
in
new
orleans,
the
foreperson
is
selected
from
the
group
of
12
instead
of
separately.
why
is
that
so?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
wouldn't
have
this
problem
if
you
did
it
throughout
the
state
the
way
they
do
it
in
that
parish.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--maybe
i
remember
the
statute
wrong.
i
thought
the
others
were
selected
in
new
orleans
just
like
they
are
in
evangeline,
and
it
was
only
the
foreperson
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you're
saying
in
new
orleans
there's
no
random
selection
at
all.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
was
also
prepowers
the
court
made
that
statement,
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
to
this
extent,
why
are
they
just
the
same.
one
of
the
points
made
in
powers
was
that
the
person
who
was
excluded
from
being
on
the
jury
in
one
case,
yes,
the
grand
jury,
that
is...
was
a
most
unlikely
challenger,
so
you
have
to
have
this
kind
of
surrogate
standing
because
the
person
who
was
excluded,
either
from
being
on
a
petit
jury
or
from
serving
here
as
the
foreperson,
that
you...
that
would
be
something
that
you
can't
imagine,
walking
into
court,
that
somebody
says,
oh,
i
could
have
been
the
foreperson
so
i'm
going
to
sue,
i'm
going
to
spend
my
resources
suing
for
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
how
is
that
any
different
from,
say,
taylor
v.
louisiana,
where
taylor
was
certainly...
taylor
was
complaining
that
there
were
no
women
in
the
jury,
and
he
was
a
man
who
raped
a
woman
in
front
of
her
child
and
still
he
had
standing
to
assert
that
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
we're
talking
about
the
alleged
injury
being
the
conviction,
then
wouldn't
that
be
true
in
all
the
cases
where
someone
who
was
not
a
member
of
the
class,
whether
it
was
racial
or
gender,
is
allowed
to
make
the
challenge?
the
case
that
i
brought
up
before,
is
it
likely
that
women
on
the
jury
would
have
been
more
favorable
to
taylor?
he
certainly
didn't
have
to
prove
that,
did
he?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
ieyoub,
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
how
things
work
in
louisiana?
in
your
brief
on
page
28
you
said
that
the...
that
the
foreperson
is
presumably
replaced
every
6
months,
as
is
the
entire
grand
jury.
is
there
any
reason
why
you...
it's
only
presumably?
is
it...
does
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
it's
always...
they
all
change,
including.
there's
no
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
no
carryover,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
grand
jury
both,
i
think.
