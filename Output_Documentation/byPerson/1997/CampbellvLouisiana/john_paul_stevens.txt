mr.
attorney
general,
why
didn't
hobby
answer
the
standing
question?
there
you
had
a
white
defendant
who
complained
about
the
very
same
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
that's
a
threshold
issue.
nobody
questioned
standing
in
hobby.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
of
course,
in
hobby
there
was...
the
foreman
was
chosen
from
among
the
12
who
had
already
been
picked
in
a
satisfactory
crosssection.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
why
isn't
hobby
the
answer
to
the
standing
issue
in
this
case
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they're
relevant
to
the
standing
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
hobby
suffer
a
palpable,
distinct
injury.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that...
the
cases
are
alike
in
that
regard,
then.
