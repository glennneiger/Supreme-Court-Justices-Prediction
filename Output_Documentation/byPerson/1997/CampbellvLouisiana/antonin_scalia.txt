the
first
equal
protection
question
is
sort
of...
i
mean,
it's
a
very
strange
assertion
of
equal
protection.
why
isn't
a
perfectly
valid
answer
to
that
that,
well,
a
black
man
could
object
to
this...
to
this
grand
jury,
but
a
black
man
couldn't
have
objected
to
a
grand
jury
in
which
the
foreman
was
always
a
black?
that's
perfectly
fair.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
almost
gameplaying
to
say
that
this
is
an
equal
protection
violation.
it's
just
a
standing
question,
simple...
simply
put.
does
he
have
standing
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
it
would
be
perfectly
equal
protection
if
louisiana
rules
a
black
man
has
standing
to
challenge
the
exclusion
of
blacks,
and
a
white
man
has
standing
to
challenge
the
exclusion
of
whites,
and
neither
one
has
a
standing
to
challenge
the
opposite.
what's
unequal
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
it
was
ruled
as
a
standing
question.
it
wasn't
dressed
up
as
an
equal
protection
claim.
i
don't
understand...
i
don't
understand
your
equal
protection
claim,
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
standing
question
is
right
or
wrong.
it
doesn't
become
right
or
wrong
because
there's
a
denial
of
equal
protection
involved
if
you
come
out
the
other
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
either
right
or
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you're
assuming
that
the
injury
is
the
ultimate
conviction,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
if
that's
the
criterion
i
suppose
there's
never
any
standing
to
challenge
the
grand
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
no
harm,
no
foul.
the
grand
jury
is
only
meant
to
determine
whether
there's
probable
cause
to
bring
you
to
trial
and
if
they
do
indict,
no
matter
how
badly
it's
set
up,
even
if
you
make
up
a
grand
jury,
once
you're
tried
by
a
petit
jury
and
found
guilty,
you
haven't
been
harmed,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
grand
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
which
suggests
that
your
argument
is
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
harm
is
not
the
ultimate
conviction.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
must
be
some
other
harm
involved.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
look...
look...
i
mean,
i
have
no
problem
with
your
due
process
standing.
i
do
have
a
problem
on
the
merits
of
the
due
process
claim,
which
is
supposed
to
be
an
assertion
that
the
conviction
here
was
fundamentally
unfair.
your
client
had
a
petit
jury,
fairly
chosen...
you
made
no
claim
that
that
wasn't
fairly
chosen...
which
found
your
client
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
of
the
crime
alleged.
now,
the
only
function
of
the
grand
jury
beforehand
is
not
to
find
whether
he's
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
to
find
whether
there's
reason
to
believe,
adequate
reason
to
believe
that
he
might
have
committed
it,
to
have
him
tried.
well,
my
goodness,
we've
gone
beyond
that.
i
mean,
the
game's
over.
a
petit
jury
has
said
yeah,
there's
not
only
reason
to
believe,
he
is
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
what
is
fundamentally
unfair
about
your
client's
conviction?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there
could
be
no
possible
mistake
a
grand
jury's
having
found
there
to
be
probable
cause,
given
that
a
petit
jury
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
he's
guilty.
i
mean,
i...
you
know,
it's
a
terrible
thing
to
exclude
people
like
that,
and
maybe
somebody
had...
i'm
sure
a
black
grand
juror
who
has
been
excluded
could
set
it
right,
or
the
justice
department
could
bring
suit
to
set
it
right,
but
i
don't
see
why
your
client
has
been
convicted
in
a
fundamentally
unfair
manner.
he's
had
a
petit
jury
that,
fairly
chosen,
found
him
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
that
right
and
there
was
an
error
made
and
somebody
should
correct
that,
but
did
that
error
deprive
him
of...
make
his
conviction
fundamentally
unfair?
it's
only
his
conviction.
i
mean,
if
you're
asking
for
something
else,
money
damages
or,
you
know,
something
different,
maybe
you've
got
a
claim
there,
but
your
client's
conviction
was
fundamentally
unfair--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
this
seems
to
be
sort
of
the
gaming
theory
of
criminal
justice.
your
client,
with
a
different
grand
jury,
might
have
been
lucky
enough
to
get
a
grand
jury
that
didn't
find
sufficient
cause
to
bring
an
indictment,
might
have
been
that
lucky,
although
it's
clear
there
was
sufficient
cause
to
bring
an
indictment.
indeed,
he
was
found
guilty
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
find
it
hard
to
find
that
a
deprivation
of
fundamental
fairness.
the
only
issue
for
the
grand
jury
was
whether
there
was
enough
evidence
here
to
bring
the
prosecution
and
that's
been
established
by
the
conviction.
it's
been
established
a
fortiori.
it's
been
established
10
times
over
by
conviction
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
i
find
it
hard
to
see
that
your
client's
been
deprived
of
fundamental
fairness.
justice
antonin
scalia
does
peters
v.
kiff
help
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
a
majority
opinion
for
the
court
in
kiff?
i
thought
there
was
not.
i
thought
we
really
don't
know
what
was--
