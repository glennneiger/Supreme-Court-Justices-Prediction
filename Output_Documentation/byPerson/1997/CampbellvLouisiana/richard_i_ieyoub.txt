mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
first
of
all,
your
honors,
i
would
like
to
correct
some
of
the
statements
made
by
counsel
for
petitioner.
he
seems
to
indicate
that
there
is
wholesale
discrimination
around
the
state
of
louisiana
as
to
the
selection
of
grand
jury
foremen.
there's
never
been
any
proof
of
this.
in
fact,
i
know
from
personal
knowledge
that
there
have
been
black
foremen
of
grand
juries
throughout
the
state
of
louisiana--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
also,
insofar
as
the
selection
of
the
foreman
is
concerned
in
louisiana,
the
judge
does
not
select
from
the
large
grand
jury
venire,
the
general
venire
of
300
persons.
what
happens
is
that
a
grand
jury
venire
is
brought
into
the
courtroom.
it
can
be
as
few
as
20
and
as
many
as
100,
but
the
grand
jury
venire
is
brought
into
the
courtroom,
the
judge
selects
the
foreman
from
the
grand
jury
venire
after
that
venire
has
been
shown
to
satisfy
the
general
qualifications
to
serve
as
grand
jurors
and
then
the
other
11
are
chosen.
it
takes
9
out
of
12
to
reach
an
indictment,
so
the
fact
that
the
grand
jury
foreman
is
necessarily
a
voting
member
of
the
grand
jury
does
not
necessarily
portend
that
his
responsibility
should
not
be
classified
as
merely
ministerial.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor.
that
was
stipulated
to
by
the
state.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
orleans
parish
is
treated
differently
throughout
louisiana
law.
nobody
knows
why,
except
for
the
fact
that
those
people
in
orleans
parish
think
that
they're
different
from
the
rest
of
the
state,
but
in
fact
there...
throughout
louisiana
law
there
are
exceptions
for
orleans
parish.
i
can't
give
your
honor
a
reason.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor,
in
orleans
parish
the
judge
does
choose
the
foreman
and
then
the
judge
also
selects
the
other
11.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
how
i
understand
it
done
in
orleans
parish.
now,
in
other
places,
other
than
orleans
parish,
the
judge
will
select
the
grand
jury
foreman
and
then
the
other
11
are
randomly
selected
out
of
the
box
and
that's
the
way
it's
done
in--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
that's
the
case.
in
evangeline
parish,
of
course,
as
i've
stated
the
judge
selects
from
the
grand
jury
venire,
and
then
the
11
are
chosen
randomly,
the
other
11
grand
jurors.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
it
doesn't
appear
that
way,
your
honor.
basically--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
what
i
think
that
involves
is
basically
ensuring
that
the
proceedings
go
through
in
a
very
orderly
way,
not
setting
forth
specific,
distinct
rules
of
procedure.
the
grand
jury
foreman,
as
stated
by
the
louisiana
supreme
court,
the
louisiana
supreme
court
has
interpreted
louisiana
law
to
mean
that
the
grand
jury
foreman's
duties
are,
in
fact,
ministerial
and--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--yes,
your
honor,
the
foreman
is
a
voting
member
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
has
some
power
to
set
the
procedure,
but
there
is
also
a
codal
article
in
the
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure
that
states
that
any
of
the
other
grand
jurors
may
rule
him
into
court
if
they
disagree
with
what
he's
doing
relative
to
the
procedure
that
takes
place
in
the
grand
jury,
which
is
some
indication
that
his
power
is
no
greater
than
the
other.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your...
mr.
chief
justice.
that
is
correct.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
in
vasquez
v.
hillery
the
petitioner,
as
i
understand
it,
was
a
member
of
the
excluded
class.
in
this
case,
there
is
no
article
iii
standing
as
to
equal
protection.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
insofar
as
powers
is
concerned,
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
powers
granted
third
party
standing,
not
personal
standing
under
article
iii
insofar
as
equal
protection
goes.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor,
not
in
any
sense
and
the
reason
i
don't
is
because,
in
finding
that
the
petitioner
in
powers
satisfied
the
three
criteria
necessary
for
third
party
standing,
that
is,
injury
in
fact,
relationship
to
the
third
party,
and
hindrance
to
the
third
party
itself
being
able
to
bring
an
action,
the
court
placed
strong
emphasis
on
the
importance
of
the
voir
dire
phase
of
the
trial
and
the
adverse
impact
that
discrimination
during
voir
dire...
the
voir
dire
stage
would
have
on
the
fairness
of
the
trial
itself.
in
finding
injury
in
fact,
this
court
pointed
out
that
when
there's
discrimination
during
the
voir
dire
stage
by
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges
the
discrimination
is
in
the
body
that's
going
to
decide
guilt
or
innocence.
that's
not
true
insofar
as
the
grand
jury
is
concerned.
the
discrimination
takes
place
during
the
trial
itself.
obviously,
grand
jury
proceedings
are
long
before--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--i
agree
with
you
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
cases
relative
to...
there's
no
question
that
there
are
grave
consequences
for
discrimination,
racial
discrimination
on
grand
juries.
most
of
the
cases
have
been
whenever
the
petitioner
has
attacked
the
entire
grand
jury
venire.
peters
v.
kiff
was
such
a
case,
where
the
entire
venire
was
attacked.
rose
v.
mitchell
did
involve
attacking
discrimination
as
to
the
foreman,
but
the
petitioner
in
that
particular
case
was
a
member
of
the
excluded
class.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
again,
i
think
that
powers
should
not
be
extended
to
cover
this
case.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
in
powers
the
court,
in
speaking
of
the
third
criteria,
that
is,
hindrance
to
the
party
excluded
itself
from
bringing
the
action
stated
that,
as
you
said,
your
honor,
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
for
an
individual
juror
excluded
during
the
voir
dire
to
bring...
such
actions
are
very
rare.
secondly,
it's
very
difficult
for
the
individual
juror
to
prove
that
there
would
be
discrimination
against
him
or
her
recurring
in
the
voir
dire
stage.
that
doesn't
hold
true
in
this
particular
case.
i
think
the
court
pointed
out
in
powers
that
discrimination
with
the
use
of
peremptory
exceptions
as
to
individual
jurors
is
different
from
when
you
have
a
systematic
exclusion
by
clerks,
by
jury
commissioners,
by
judges...
there
have
been
numerous
actions
brought
by
individual
blacks
alleging
that
there
has
been
discrimination
on...
discrimination
as
to
the
selection
of
the
foreman
in
the
grand
jury.
there
seems
to
be
no
hindrance.
terry
campbell
is
a
very
poor
champion
of
third
party
rights
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
taylor
v.
louisiana?
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
again,
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
in
taylor,
taylor
made
a
valid
due
process
claim
that
the
entire
grand
jury
venire,
that
in
that
entire
venire
there
had
been
an
exclusion,
systematic
exclusion
of
women.
as
such,
that
particular
grand
jury
did
not
represent
the
varieties
of
human
experience
and
the
qualities
of
human--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
as
to
equal
protection,
as
to
an
equal
protection
claim--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
i
would...
if
the
claim...
if
there
is
a
claim
that
due
process
has
been
violated
with
the
court's
announcement
that
there's
discrimination
as
to
1/12th
of
the
grand
jury,
that
being
the
grand
jury
foreman,
then
i
think
that
we
have
to
do
an
analysis
as
to
whether
or
not
discrimination
as
to
that
one
person
is
so
significant
that
it
has
an
appreciable
impact
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that
a
white
person--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
i
concede
that.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--hobby
v.
united
states
felt...
of
course,
hobby
was
remedied,
there's
no
question
about
that,
but
in
hobby
v.
united
states
the
court,
or
this
court
found
that
if
there
is
discrimination
as
to
one
individual,
who
in
fact
maintains
a
ministerial
position
and
the
rest
of
the
grand
jury
as
a
whole
meets
the
representational
requirements
or
values
of
due
process,
then
that...
there
has
not
been
a
violation
of
due--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--we
would
win
on
the
merits.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor.
first
of
all,
the
individual
has
to
show
an
injury
in
fact.
that
injury
has
to
be
palpable.
it
has
to
be
distinct.
it
can't
be
hypothetical
or
analytical.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
the
court,
or
this
court
did
not
speak
of
standing
in
hobby.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
we
have
different
circumstances
in
this
case
than
existed
in
hobby,
your
honor
and
let
me
explain.
first
of
all--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--relevant
to
the
standing
issue.
first
of
all,
injury
in
fact.
in
this
case,
for
instance,
campbell's
injury
in
fact,
mr.
campbell
has
not
suffered
an
injury
in
fact.
he
has
not
suffered
a
palpable,
distinct
injury
and
i
think
hobby
shows
that.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no.
no,
your
honor,
he
did
not.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
they're
alike
in
that
regard.
secondly,
causation,
as
to
causation
there
has...
the
injury
has
to
be
fairly
traceable
to
the
conduct
complained
of,
or
the
illegal
injury.
in
this
case,
the
state
respectfully
submits
that
in
no
way
is
the
injury
to
petitioner
fairly
traceable
to
the
fact
that
there
might
have
been
discrimination
as
to
the
grand
jury
foreman.
in
fact,
in
this
case
the
petitioner's
grand
jury
had
three
blacks
on
the
grand
jury.
he
had
six
blacks
on
the
petit
jury
that
convicted
him.
he
used
five
of
his
peremptory
exceptions
to
knock
off
five
blacks,
where
the
state
only
used
one
peremptory
exception.
how
can
it
be
said
that
there's
causation
as
to
standing
here?
and
finally,
redressability.
it
has
to
be
shown--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
well--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
held
that
if,
in
fact,
there's...
discrimination
can
be
found--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--racial
discrimination--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--in
the
grand
jury,
that
is,
if
there
is
discrimination--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--even
if
we
say
that
the
harm
is
the
fact
that
the
individual
was
indicted,
you
must...
again,
i
will
show
that
in
order
for
an
indictment
to
come
down
in
terry
campbell's
case
it
just
took
9...
9
out
of
the
12.
we
don't
know
what
the
vote
was
in
this
grand
jury,
whether
or
not
the
foreman
actually
voted
for
indictment
or
not,
but
in
any
event,
i
don't
see
how
his
injury
is
in
any
way
fairly
traceable
to
the
alleged
misconduct
here,
or
any
misconduct
that
might
be
alleged.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor.
now...
but
insofar
as
due
process
is
concerned,
in
addition
to
injury
in
fact
and
causation,
there
has
to
be
redressability.
that
means
that
the
petitioner
must
be...
there
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
likely
that
a
favorable
decision
of
the
court,
that
is,
as
to
standing,
would
grant
the
relief
that
he's
asking
for
and
that
would
not
the
case,
i
don't
think,
in
here,
in
light
of
hobby
v.
united
states.
if
this
court
would
find,
for
instance,
that
he
might
have
standing
under
the--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
you
say
that
discrimination
did
not
affect
the
hobby...
in
hobby--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
even
if
it
affects
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury,
we
have
to
determine
whether
or
not
that
particular
effect
violates
due
process
values
if
he
is
making
a
claim
under
the
due
process
clause.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
the
fact
that
there
may
have
been
discrimination
as
to
the
foreman
in
this
case
in
no
way
violates
the
due
process
values
because
we
have
stated,
and
i
think
the
louisiana
supreme
court
in
interpreting
our
law
has
stated,
that
basically
the
grand
jury
foreman's
duties
are
ministerial.
in
addition,
hobby--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--no,
your
honor,
but
in
federal...
in
the
federal
grand
jury
the
foreman
is
also
a
voting
member,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
so--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
the
composition
is
affected,
your
honor,
but
how
is
it
affected?
and
let
me
point
out
that
hobby,
in
addition
to
talking--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
of
course,
the
petitioner
would
have
to
prove
a--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--right,
would
have
to
prove--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--in
addition,
your
honor,
just
speaking
of
the
foreman
and
the
ministerial
responsibilities
of
the
foreman
in
hobby,
the
court
pointed
out
that
if
there
is
discrimination
as
to
one
individual...
in
hobby
it
happened
to
be
the
foreman,
but
that
if
there
was
discrimination
as
to
one
individual
and
the
grand
jury
as
a
whole,
the
rest
of
the
grand
jury
satisfied
the
representational
requirements
of
due
process,
then
that
would
not
be
enough
to
find
that
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
petitioner's
rights.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
your
honor,
i
think
that
if
in
fact
it
can
be
shown
that
there
is
systematic
exclusion
of
a
number
of
individuals--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
i
would
say
that
one
is
not
enough.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
we
would
have
to
take
that
on
a
casebycase
basis,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
would--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--whenever
the
petitioner
makes
the
claim
that
the
grand
jury
venire,
the
entire
venire
or
a
large
part
of
the
venire
has
been
selected
in
a
discriminatory
way
so
that
due
process
values
have
been
violated.
in
this
particular--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
standing
to
make
a
claim,
as
i
said
earlier,
if
there's
an
allegation
that
only...
that
there
was
discrimination
as
to
the
foreman
of
the
grand
jury,
or
any
one
of
the
other
12.
i
don't
think
that
there
would
be
standing
to
make
that
claim
there.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes,
your
honor,
because
i
don't
think--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
as
i
have
argued,
has
really
satisfied
the
criteria
for
article
iii
standing
under
allen
v.
wright.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
know
why
the
court
didn't
address...
necessarily
address
standing
in
hobby.
they
found
that
there
was
no
violation
of
due
process
rights
and
we
would
argue
that
hobby
should
hold
here.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
remedy,
yes,
your
honor,
no
remedy.
the
basic
claim
of
the
petitioner
in
this
particular
case
has
been
that
he
has
third
party
standing
to
assert
the
rights
of
a
third
party.
that's
his
basic
claim.
that's
his
chief
claim.
his
lawyer
stood
up
at
the
motion
to
quash
and
argued,
saying
terry's
rights
have
not
been
violated.
he
is
asserting
the
rights
of
the
third
party
that
has
been
excluded.
it
has
always
been
third
party
standing
and
we
suggest
that,
under
powers
v.
ohio,
that
he
doesn't
have
third
party
standing.
powers
v.
ohio
granted
third
party
standing
because
of
the
particular
nature
of
the
voir
dire
phase
of
the
trial
and
the
types
of
discrimination
that
took
place
at
that
time.
that
did
not
occur.
how
in
the
world
can
we
say,
with
respect,
your
honors,
that
there
is
a
bond
of
trust
that
is
created
between
the
petitioner
and
the
third
party
whenever
there's
a
selection
of
a
grand
jury
foreman.
the
defendant
is
not
even
present
in
court
for...
as
a
practical
matter.
as
long--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
yes.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
not
as
to
equal
protection.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
i
think
under
due
process
the
white
person
would--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--that--
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
--well,
the
theory
of
it
would
be,
your
honor,
that
this
has
a
significant
impact,
that
there's
more
of
a
significant
impact
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice,
that
due
process
representational
values
are
not
satisfied
in
the
second
case.
but
as
in
this
case
he
does
not
have
third
party
standing.
he
does
not
have...
he
has
not
shown
that
he
satisfies
the
criteria
in
article
iii
that
is
stated,
that
is,
injury
in
fact,
causation,
and
redressability.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
no,
your
honor.
i
think
that
they
are
replaced.
grand
juries
in
louisiana
sit
for
not
less
than
4
months
nor
more
than
8,
and
when
a
grand
jury
is
dispensed
with,
then
the
grand
jury
foreman
changes.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
i.
ieyoub
that's
correct,
your
honor,
unlike
tennessee
in
the
rose
case,
where
the
grand
juror,
jury
foreman
could
sit
for
2
years,
or
as
long
as
a
judge
wanted
him
to
sit.
but
your
honors,
with
all
due
respect,
we
feel
that
petitioner
powers'
conviction
should
be
affirmed.
this
court
is
always
adding
stories
to
the
temples
of
constitutional
law,
but
your
honors,
if
the
court
please,
we
urge
justice
jackson's
caution
and
that
is
that
the
temples
have
a
way
of
collapsing
if
one
too
many
stories
is
added.
your
honors,
we
request
that
the
conviction
be
affirmed.
