justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
now
you're
going
to
the
substance
of
the
claim
rather
than
the
issue
of
standing.
justice
david
h.
souter
taking
you
at
your
argument
here,
would
it
be
your
position
that
if
the
state
were
to
say,
we
will...
in
fact,
we'll
announce
this,
that
we
will
in
fact
discriminatorily
exclude
blacks
from
1/12th
of
all
grand
jury
positions,
one
of
the
12
positions
will
always
go
to
a
white,
that
in
fact
that
would
not
support
a
claim
with
respect
to
the
invalid
composition
of
the
jury?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
no,
i'm
responding
to
your
argument
and
your
argument,
if
i
understood
it
correctly,
was
that
somehow
we
can
respond
to
standing
here
by
saying
that
there
is
no
claim
with
respect
to
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury
as
a
whole.
if
i
misunderstood
your
argument,
tell
me,
but
i
thought
that's
what
you
were
arguing
and
so
i
want
to
see
how
far
you
will
go
with
that
and
i'm
saying,
i'm
asking
you,
if
the
state
announced
right
up
front,
we
are
going
to
discriminate
with
respect
to
1/12th
of
the
positions
on
every
grand
jury,
would
that,
in
fact,
be
insufficient
to
support
a
claim
with
respect
to
the
invalid
composition
of
the
jury
and,
on
your
argument,
insufficient
to
result
in
standing
for
anybody?
justice
david
h.
souter
then
the
answer
to
my
question
is
no,
that
alone
would
not--
justice
david
h.
souter
--support
a
claim.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
interrupt
you
with
this
question,
then.
as
i
think
all
of
our
questions
have
indicated
and
you
yourself
agree,
the
difference
between
hobby
and
this
case
was
that
in
hobby
the
discrimination
did
not
affect
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury.
here,
it
does.
if
there
was
discrimination
here,
it
affected
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury.
isn't
that
the
distinction
between
this
case
and
hobby?
justice
david
h.
souter
as
i
understand
it,
and
you
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
in
hobby
a
grand
jury
was
selected.
after
that
selection
process,
one
person
was
designated
to
be
the
foreman.
in
this
case,
one
person
is
designated
to
be
the
foreman
and
the
claim
is
that
that
discriminatory
designation
determines
the
composition
of
one
out
of
12
members
of
the
grand
jury.
therefore,
the
discrimination
here,
if
it
is
shown,
affects
the
composition
of
the
grand
jury,
who
is
one
of
the
12,
whereas
in
hobby
it
did
not
affect
who
was
one
of
the
12,
or
whatever
the
number
is.
isn't...
is
that
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
his
duties
as
foreman
may
be
ministerial.
we
can
accept
that
for
the
sake
of
argument.
his
duty
as
a
voting
member
of
the
grand
jury
isn't
ministerial,
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
suggest
the
point
this
way.
as
i
understand
the
petitioner
here,
the
argument
really
would
be
essentially
the
same
if
the
person
selected
by
this
method
of
designation
by
the
court
were
not
the
foreman
at
all,
were
just
one
random
member
of
the
grand
jury
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me,
although
it's...
it
certainly
makes
it
a
harder
case,
if
you
will--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
one
sense
if
the
grand
jury
is...
if
the
foreman's
responsibilities
are
ministerial.
it
doesn't
eliminate
the
case,
because
the
composition
is
still
affected.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
claim
is.
it
is
affected
in
a
discriminatory
way
in
that
1/12th
of
every
grand
jury
is
going
to
be
the
result
of
a
racial
discrimination.
that's
what
the
claim
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
all
that's
affected.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
why
we
have
trials,
but
that
doesn't
go
to...
the
question
is,
how
does
it
affect
standing?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
many
would
it
take,
2
out
of
12,
3
out
of
12,
4
out
of
12?
when
do
we
cross
the
line,
on
your
reading
of
hobby?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
many?
one
is
not
enough.
what's
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
how
many
is
enough?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you're
not
taking
this
on
a
casebycase
basis.
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
one,
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
not
enough.
when
do
we
get
to
the
point
at
which,
as
a
matter
of
law,
it
might
be
possible?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
claim
here
is
not
that
the
venire
was
discriminatorily
chosen,
but
that
individuals
were
discriminatorily
chosen
from
the
venire,
so
if
your
argument
is
correct
there
never
would
be
standing
to
make
a
claim
because
there
never
would
be
a
claim.
