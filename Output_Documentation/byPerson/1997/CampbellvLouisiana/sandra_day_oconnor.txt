justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
same
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
apparently
other
parishes
are
doing
the
same
thing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
uhhuh.
let
me
ask
you,
since
you're
interrupted,
how...
you
make
a
faircrosssectionofthejury
claim
with
regard
to
the
foreperson
of
the
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
that
work
in
connection
with
a
single
person,
a
foreperson?
how
would
we
apply
a
faircrosssection
theory
to
that?
i
guess
you
have
a
couple
of
other
theories,
equal
protection
and
due
process,
but
it
certainly
isn't
clear
to
me
how
a
fair
crosssection
claim
could
be
made
out.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right,
so...
but
you're
pursuing
that
claim,
nonetheless.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
would
you
like
to
justify
it,
since
you're
pursuing
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
this
work?
there
are
300
people
on
the
big
venire
that
are
called?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
judge
selects
someone
from
that
large
number
to
be
the
foreperson
of
the
grand
jury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
subsequently
the
other
members
of
the
grand
jury
are
selected
at
random
by
a
clerk
or
something
of
that
sort.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
different,
then,
from
the
situation
in
the
hobby
case
that
we
had?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
the
court
said
the
grand
jury
foreman
in
that
case
had
a
ministerial
role?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
hobby
focused
on
the
remedy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
do
we
have
to
look
at
here,
just
standing?
we're
not
concerned
here
today
with
remedy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
just
standing?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
that
all...
of
the
questions
in
the
petition
refer
to
whether
your
client
has
standing
to
raise
the
equal
protection
claim,
the
due
process
claim,
and
the
fair
crosssection
claim.
it
didn't
occur
to
me
that
you
intended
to
ask
us
to
apply
a
remedy.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
other
than
to
rule
on
the
standing
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
send
it
back,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
we
were
to
determine
there
was
standing
on
some
or
all
of
these
matters.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
in
this
case
your
client
raised
this...
these
claims
all
along--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
the
proceedings
below.
there's
no
problem
of
waiver
or
anything
of
that
kind.
these
have
been
preserved,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
foreman
a
voting
member
of
the
grand
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
has
some
power
to
set
procedure.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
vasquez
v.
hillery
this
court
referred
to
the
grave
constitutional
trespass
that
occurs
when
jurors
of
a
particular
race
are
intentionally
excluded
from
the
grand
jury,
so
if
the
proof
is
that
in
the
case
of
one
member
of
the
grand
jury
that
blacks
are
always
excluded
from
this
foreperson
selection,
then
why
doesn't
that
fit
under
vasquez
v.
hillery?
why
isn't
there
standing
to
raise
that
on
the
part
of
this
petitioner?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
the
case
of
powers,
when
the
issue
was
with
respect
to
a
trial
jury
we
didn't
think
that
mattered.
would
there
be
a
different
rule
on
a
grand
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
that's
an
argument
here,
too.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
concede
that
at
least
the
petitioner
has
third
party
standing
under
powers?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
why
i
referred
you
to
the
vasquez
v.
hillery
description
of
the
grave
constitutional
injury
that
occurs
on
a
grand
jury
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
we
found
standing
in
hobby.
you
want
us
to
ignore
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
don't
see
how
we
can
or
should.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
there
were
no
article
iii
standing
in
hobby,
this
court
would
have
had
to
say
so
on
its
own
motion.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
said
there
was
no
remedy
required
in
that.
