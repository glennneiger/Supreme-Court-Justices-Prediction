justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
this
is
just
really
a
somewhat
standard
argument
that
the
rule
11
colloquy
was
inadequate?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
take
it
that
even
pre
bailey
you
would
have
this
same
objection.
you
talk
about
possession,
not
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
then
that
goes
to
the
next
argument
that
the
law
has
changed
in
your
view,
et
cetera,
but
if
this
were
pre
bailey,
and
bailey
had
never
been
on
the
books,
would
you...
you
would
still
say,
i
take
it,
that
the
plea
was
inadequately
counseled
and
that
the
colloquy
under
rule
11
was
inadequate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
they
talked
about
possession,
not
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
that's
a
conventional
argument
and
that
the
plea
bargain
and
the
fact
that
he
had
the
indictment,
the
plea...
he
signed
the
plea
agreement,
did
he
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
adequate...
and
that
sets
forth
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
did
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
says
count
2
charges
that
defendant
was
using
a
firearm.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
statute
doesn't
talk
about
active
employment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
the
plea
agreement,
at
least,
was
in
terms
of
the
statute,
as
was
the
indictment,
of
course.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
that's
an
important
substantive
argument.
i
don't
think
it
means
the
plea
is
involuntary.
voluntariness
of
the
plea
should
be
tested
by
the
adequacy
and
competency
of
counsel
based
on
the
laws
that
exists
at
the
time.
then
if
you
want
to
say
that
the
law
has
changed
and
he
should
be
released
anyway
because
it's
substantively
retroactive,
that's
another
argument,
but
i
don't
think
it
invalidates
the
plea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
put
it
this
way.
has
it
been
the
practice
of
the
district
courts
uniformly
to
say
that
the
guilty
pleas
were
involuntary,
which
is
the
position
you
surprisingly
take
in
your
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
to
take
the
example
that
again
the
chief
justice
gave,
i
think
it
was
in
ratzlaf
that
we
held
the
defendant
had
to
have
knowledge
of
the
banking
regulation.
under
your
view,
a)
all
of
those
pleas
that
were
previous
to
that
are...
were
involuntary
and,
second,
even
if
they're
not
the
convictions
are
void,
so
i
assume
that
all
the
fines
have
to
be
given
back.
is
the
government
going
to
give
back
all
the
fines?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
it
have
to
be
a
constitutional
error?
suppose
we
don't...
i
don't
think
this
is
a
constitutional
error.
what's
the
constitutional
error
here?
is
this
a
violation
of
due
process
here
to
hold
an
innocent
man?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
not
linked
to
the
actual
innocence
gateway
exception
that
you
just
applied.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
what's
the
constitutional
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
we
go
back
to
the
very
beginning.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
another
thing
he
says
in
the
guilty
plea
is
that
he
wants
to
end
the
criminal
process.
he
wants
to
begin
that
necessary
reconciliation
to
return
him
to
civilized
society,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
very
much
undercutting
the
whole
purpose
of
a
guilty
plea
by
your
argument
and
that
your
argument
also
requires
such
an
arcane
and
abstract
course
of
reasoning
that
it
seems
to
cast
doubt
on
the
whole
question
of
whether
or
not
our
decision
is
retroactive
at
all
to
a
final
judgment.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
think
at
bottom
it's
a
little
more
than
that.
it
was
that
this
statute
was
misinterpreted
by
the
lower
courts.
justice
harlan
in
mackey
and
in
desist
confined
the
retroactivity
to
conduct
that
could
not
be
made
a
crime,
flag
burning
and
so
forth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
the
reason
that
he
did
that
because
there
was
an
extant
body
of
jurisprudence
or
understanding
that
statutory
interpretations
are
not
retroactive
to
final
judgments,
or
was
this...
do
you
think
this
was
just
the
assumption
of
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
neither
side
has
a
great
case
for
us
on
that,
on
the
substantive
point
of
retroactivity
of
statutory
reinterpretations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
mean,
all
those
books
in
my
office,
this
thing
has
never
come
up?
