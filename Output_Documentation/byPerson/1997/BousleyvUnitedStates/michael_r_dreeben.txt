mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bailey,
interpreting
the
use
element
of
the
section
924(c)
offense,
gives
rise
to
a
variety
of
fairly
complicated
legal
issues
involving
whether
bailey
is
a
new
rule
under
the
teague
decision,
would
affect
the
guilty
plea
the
petitioner
entered...
has
in
this
case,
and
whether
petitioner
is
a...
is
subject
to
procedural
default
that
he
must
overcome
in
order
to
get
collateral
relief.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
scalia,
that
has,
in
fact,
been
the
practice
that
the
lower
courts
have
followed
when
this
court
has
rendered
a
decision
that
cuts
back
on
the
reach
of
a
federal
criminal
statute
as
compared
to
the
view
that
had
prevailed
in
the
lower
courts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
issue
has
not
been
litigated
in
that
fashion,
justice
kennedy,
so
i
can't
say
that
there
are
a
huge
number
of
cases
that
address
it
in
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
by
and
large,
justice
kennedy,
the
lower
courts,
when
confronted
with
guilty
pleas
that
were
entered
under
a
serious
misunderstanding
of
the
law,
have
left
the
defendant
out
of
the
plea
subject
to
the
inquiry
that
we
think
is
critical
in
this
case,
which
is
whether
the
defendant
can
establish
that,
under
the
correct
interpretation
of
the
law,
he
is
actually
innocent.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
chief
justice
rehnquist,
we
have
taken
a
position
that
we
think
balances
the
fundamental
interest
in
obtaining
convictions
under
a
correct
understanding
of
the
law
with
the
interests
in
finality
that
we
share
with
the
courts.
under
section
924(c),
we
advocated
for
many
years
a
position
that
in
essence
permitted
us
to
obtain
convictions
based
on
a
showing
of
possession
of
a
firearm
near
guns.
this
court
unanimously
rejected
that
position.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
near
drugs.
thank
you.
this
court
unanimously
rejected
that
position.
we
were
left
with
quite
a
few
convictions
that
we
had
obtained
without
ever
proving
the
essential
element
of
active
use
and
which
guilty
pleas
have
been
entered
with
the
defendant
never
having
conceded
that
element
and
the
question
is,
what
happens
to
those
convictions
in
which
the
government
has
not
established
and
the
courts
have
never
determined
whether
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
was
satisfied?
in
our
view,
the
progression
of
analysis
here
leads
to
the
following
conclusion.
the
decision
of
this
court
in
bailey
says
what
the
statute
always
meant.
it
doesn't
say
what
the
statute
meant
from
the
date
that
this
court
decided
it,
and
we're
prepared
to
accept
that
consequence,
which
means
that,
as
to
the
convictions
that
we
obtained
before,
there
is
the
possibility,
although
not
a
certainty,
that
defendants
may
have
either
been
pleaded
guilty
or
been
convicted
based
on
conduct
that
is
not
a
crime
and
that,
to
us,
raises
a
question
that
ought
to
be
available
to
be
considered
on
habeas
corpus
if
there's
a
statutory
basis
for
asserting
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
certainly
true,
justice
scalia.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
circuit
law
at
the
time
doesn't
define
what
the
crime
is,
and
the
premise
of
using
a
guilty
plea
as
a
basis
for
incarcerating
an
individual
is
that
the
individual
has
conceded
that
he
is
guilty
of
the
elements
of
the
crime.
if
the
defendant
never
gets
an
adequate
explanation
of
what
the
elements
are
either
from
his
lawyer
or
from
the
court,
it's
very
difficult--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--to
say
that
that
plea
knowingly
concedes
guilt
of
the
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
we
don't
think
that
everything
that
happened
in
the
past
is
washed
out
by
any
means.
there
is
a
judgment
of
conviction
on
the
books,
and
the
petitioner
has
the
burden
of
explaining
why
it
should
be
set
aside,
even
though
he
did
not
challenge
the
issue
that
he
now
raises
at
the
proper
time,
and
for
that
reason
we
think
two
things
are
true.
first,
congress
is
the
one
who
determined
what
the
elements
of
924(c)
are,
and
this
court
said
so
in
1995
in
bailey,
so
that
decision
explained
what
the
law
was
from
the
time
that
congress
enacted
the
statute.
but
petitioner
had
the
burden
of
bringing
that
issue
to
the
attention
to
the
courts
at
the
timely
way
that
the
procedure
of
the
law
provides
for
him
upon
pain
of
procedural
default
and
he
did
not
do
that
here,
so
our
position
is
that
unless
he
can
overcome
his
procedural
default
by
showing
either
cause
in
prejudice
or
actual
innocence,
his
conviction
stands
and
the
past--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
his
claim.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
and
it
is
a
narrow
claim--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
actual
innocence...
i
think
it's
very
important
to
focus
on
this.
actual
innocence
in
our
view
is
not
an
independent,
freestanding
legal
claim
that
he
has
the
right
to
bring
into
court.
it
represents,
as
this
court
said
in
the
schlup
decision,
a
gateway
that
permits
him
to
present
a
court...
to
a
court
a
defaulted
claim
that
would
otherwise
be
permanently
barred
from
judicial
cognizance
on
2255
or
habeas
corpus.
it
is
the
last
safety
valve
in
the
system
for
a
defendant
who
was
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
right.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that,
justice
o'connor,
constitutes
his
default.
he
should
have
done
that.
he
did
not
do
that.
but
once
a
defendant
does
procedurally
default
on
a
claim,
they
can
get
it
into
federal
court
on
2255
under
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
frady
only
by
making
one
of
two
showings.
first,
they
can
show
cause
for
their
default,
prejudice
flowing
from
the
error
that
they
claim,
and
we
say
in
this
case
he
has
no
cause
for
not
raising
it.
as
your
honor
has
pointed
out,
defendant's
were
raising
this
issue
all
over
the
country.
he
could
have
done
that.
he
elected
not
to.
it's
a
default,
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
in
saying
that
he
did
default
his
claim.
but
there
is
a
safety
valve
above
and
beyond
cause
and
prejudice
that
this
court
articulated
in
smith
v.
murray
and
in
murray
v.
carrier
and
other
cases
that
says
that
even
when
a
defendant
has
defaulted
his
claim,
if
he
can
make
a
colorable
threshold
showing
that
he
is
actually
innocent
of
the
offense
and
it
is
only
as
a
result
of
the
error,
the
constitutional
error
that
he
claims,
that
he
remains
in
prison,
a
habeas
court
can
reach
the
merits.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
kennedy.
i
think
that
we
may
disagree
on
whether
there
is
a
constitutional
error
with
respect
to
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea.
that
is
the
constitutional
error
that
we
have
identified
that
he
can
raise
on
2255.
the
statutory
claim--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
first
thing
that
any
defendant
needs
to
show
if
they
want
to
get
in
the
door
on
2255
is
either
a
constitutional
claim
or
a
statutory
claim
that
is
cognizable
in
2255
proceedings.
we
don't
think
he
has
any
statutory
claim
that's
cognizable
on
2255
because
he
did
plead
guilty.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
constitutional
claim
is
that
in
order
for
a
defendant
to
enter
a
valid
guilty
plea
which
waives
his
privilege
against
compulsory
self
incrimination
and
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
he
must
have
an
adequate
understanding
of
what
elements
of
the
offense
he's
admitting
to.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
go
back
to
the
premise
that
when
congress
enacts
a
statute
that
tells
us
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
are,
and
if
that
defendant
didn't
get
any
notice
of
that,
his
plea
of
guilty
is
not
a
reliable
basis
for
concluding
that
he
is
guilty.
if
the
judge
says,
this
statute
has
elements
a,
b,
and
c,
do
you
admit
that
you
did
these
elements,
and
he
says
yes,
i
do,
judge,
there's
no
question
my
conduct
satisfies
that,
but
the
statute
actually
contains
element
d,
which
is
an
element
of
his
conduct
that
has
never
been
explained
to
him
and
that
he
does
not
admit
doing,
the
guilty
plea
does
not
represent
a
reliable
determination
that
he
is,
indeed,
guilty
of
the
offense.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
agree,
justice
kennedy,
that
there
are
a
number
of
fairly
arcane
questions
that
are
built
into
the
analysis
in
a
case
like
this
because
this
court
has
enunciated
a
number
of
doctrines
that
sharply
limit
and,
we
think,
appropriately
so
the
availability
of
relief
on
habeas
corpus.
and
i
am
prepared
to
march
through
the
various
doctrines
and
explain
them,
but
i
wanted
to
state
at
the
outset
and
at
this
point
that
our
basic
position
is
that
if
the
defendant's
guilty
plea
doesn't
admit
to
all
the
elements
of
the
crime
because
they
have
never
been
explained
to
him,
and
yet
he
did
not
challenge
that
at
the
appropriate
time,
he
has
a
remedy
in
habeas
corpus
at
present
under
the
present
statutory
regime
if,
and
only
if,
he
can
show
he
is
actually
innocent,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
applies
similarly,
justice
breyer.
there
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--very
few
people
actually
get
relief
under
the
analysis
that
we
propose,
and
very
few
people
have--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no,
i
didn't
say
that
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--for
example,
when
this
court
decided
the
mcnalley
case
and
said
that
the
intangible
rights
theory
of
good
government
did
not
fall
within
the
mail
fraud
statute,
there
were
a
lot
of
defendants
who
had
been
convicted,
some
under
guilty
pleas,
some
under
trial,
as
to
whom
the
government
had
never
shown
the
kind
of
fraud
that
this
court
held
was
in
the
mail
fraud
statute.
those
defendants
were
freely
allowed
to
come
back
into
court
and
attempt
to
make
the
case
that
they
were
innocent
under
the
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
this
court
said
was
correct.
most
of
them
failed,
because
in
the
process
of
proving
an
intangible
rights
violation,
we
most
often
did
prove
some
injury
to
money
or
property
that
this
court
said
was
the
proper
definition
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
are
relatively
few
cases,
justice
scalia,
but
i
have
not
seen
a
single
case
in
which
a
court
said
because
of
your
guilty
plea
you
are
barred
from
even
coming
into
court
and
saying
that
the
statutory
meaning
changed
and
what
you
did
is
not
a
crime
at
the
court
of
appeals
level.
there
are
comparatively
few
cases
before
bailey
in
which
this
issue
was
presented
to
courts
and
ruled
upon.
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes,
justice
ginsburg,
there
were
cases
in
the
wake
of
ratzlaf,
and
i'd
have
to
say
that
in
most
of
those
cases
where
the
government
had
obtained
either
a
guilty
plea
or
a
conviction
after
a
trial
and
it
had
never
established
the
defendant's
knowledge
of
the
law,
as
this
court
said
was
required
under
ratzlaf,
we
didn't
object
to
giving
the
defendant
an
opportunity
to
get
some
form
of
relief
if,
indeed,
he
could
establish
that
he
had
a
colorable
claim
of
innocence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
souter,
in
most
contexts
it
is
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
plea
that
should
govern
the
analysis
of
the
question,
and
that
is
because
if
you
look
at
a
case
like
brady,
in
which
this
court
basically
said
then
existing
law
governs
the
validity
of
the
plea,
the
question
that
is
being
asked
is,
the
defendant
has
admitted
his
guilt
of
the
substantive
offense
and
now,
should
we
let
him
after
the
fact
say,
in
hindsight
i
miscalculated
about
what
the
law
might
have
been,
if
i
had
known
what
the
law
would
be,
i
never
would
have
admitted
my
guilt.
and
i
think
the
law
quite
properly
says,
that's
not
the
kind
of
claim
you
can
raise.
you
must
take
your
chances
with
what
the
consequences
of
pleading
guilty
might
be,
or
whether
you
had
a
good
suppression
motion
that
you
forewent,
but
this
case
is
different,
because
the
requirement
for
the
valid
admission
of
guilt
that
justifies
holding
somebody
in
prison
in
the
first
place
is
that
he
had
an
idea
of
what
the
crime
was
that
he
was
pleading
guilty
to,
in
other
words,
as
this
court
said
in
henderson
v.
morgan,
that
he
had
true
knowledge
of
the
charges
that
he
was
admitting.
this
defendant
knew
that
he
was
admitting
possession
of
a
firearm
near
drugs
and
he
was
told
that
that
made
him
guilty
of
a
criminal
offense
and
he
said,
i
did
that.
those
facts
are
correct.
i'm
willing
to
take
a
guilty
plea.
but
in
fact,
that's
not
what
the
law
meant,
as
we
now
know
from
bailey,
was
required
to
obtain
a
valid
admission
of
guilt,
so
justice
souter,
my
distinction
is
that
the
core
basis
for
allowing
a
guilty
plea
rather
than
a
trial
to
establish
guilt
is
that
the
defendant
acknowledges
that
this
conduct
either
was
or
can
be
shown
to
be
satisfying
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
under
a
proper
understanding.
if
he
lacks
that
proper
understanding,
his
admission
of
the
crime
is
not
a
valid
basis
for
holding
him
in
prison,
and
that
is
distinct
from
all
of
the
other
considerations
that
he
might
have
viewed
in
hindsight
as
impugning
whether
he
would
have
made
that
admission.
here,
he
never
really
made
it
in
the
first
place.
thank
you.
