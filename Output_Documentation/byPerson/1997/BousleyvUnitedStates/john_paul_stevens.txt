justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt?
isn't
the
test
what
the
law
was
at
the
time,
and
in
your
view,
what
was
the
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
has
misconstrued
the
law
didn't
make
it
the
law,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
didn't
we
squarely
hold
that
in
rivers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
your
rule
is
that
the
plea
is
involuntary
if
he
doesn't
know
all
of
the
correct
elements,
all
of
the
correct
definition
of
the
elements
of
the
crime,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
district
judge
doesn't
have
much
to
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
hope
we
can
get
beyond
this.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plea
is
clearly
voluntary
based
on
the
law
at
the
time.
now,
if
you
want
to
say
that
it
should
be
set
aside
in
any
event
because
the
law
has
changed,
that's
quite
a
different
argument.
and
i
might
just
point
out,
you
did
not
raise
the
involuntariness
point
as...
in
your
petition
for
certiorari,
did
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
henderson
v.
morgan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
the
reason
this
court
gave
for
saying
that
the
plea
was
involuntary
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
wasn't
apprised
of
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that's
the
reason
the
court
said
that
there
was
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
in
that
he
did
not
plead
voluntarily
because
no
one
told
him
of
one
of
the
elements
of
the
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
we
set
aside
a
state
conviction
on
a
guilty
plea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
if
there's
one
element
of
the
offense
he
doesn't
understand,
you've
got
to
set
aside
his
guilty
plea.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
what
the
opinion
says.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
surely
does
raise
the
constitutional...
henderson
squarely
holds,
if
you
do
not
advise
the
guilty...
the
man
before
he
pleads
guilty
of
all
the
elements
of
the
offense,
the
plea
is
involuntary,
and
that's
what
happened
there,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
here
is
what
we
say
it
is.
it's
not
what
the
district
judge
erroneously
thought
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
certainly
can.
he
certainly
has
a
duty
to
do
it
if
the
law
in
fact
is
what
congress
enacted
as
we
interpret
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
squarely
held
that
in
the
rivers
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
said
there
the
statute
always
has
the
same
meaning.
it
had
that
meaning
since
the
date
of
enactment.
the
fact
that
a
lot
of
courts
of
appeals,
and
there
were
just
as
many
there,
had
read
it
the
other
way
didn't
cut
any
ice
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
the
law
as
he
finds
it.
it's
the
law
as
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
in
henderson
the
defendant
was
incorrectly
advised
by
his
counsel
as
to
what
the
law
was,
and
he
acted
on
his
advice
of
counsel
and
pleaded
to
a
crime
that
had
not
been
charged.
justice
john
paul
stevens
those
are
not
elements
of
the
offense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
a
question
of
miscalculating
the
consequences
of
his
actions.
it's
a
question
of
entering
a
plea
without
being
advised
of
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
to
which
he's
asked
to
plea
were--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--by
either
the
court
or
his
counsel.
