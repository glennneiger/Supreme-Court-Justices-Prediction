justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
meant
also
if
he
was
convicted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
how
does
it
apply,
how
does
it
apply
to
a
person
convicted?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
it
applies
similarly,
then
is
it...
has
it
been
the
practice...
you
started
off
with
something
very
important
to
me.
you
said
that...
i'm
thinking
of
many
statutes...
drug
statutes
have
words
in
it
like
customs
orders
of
the
united
states.
we
had
a
bribery
statute
that
was
all
state
law
bribery
is
connected
with
a
federal
program.
there
are
thousands
of
statutes
that
have
difficult
statutory
interpretations
in
them.
is
it...
you're
saying
that
it's
common
practice
until
this
case,
i
guess,
that
where
there
was
an
interpretation
that
was
in
doubt
and
a
court
resolved
it,
all
the
courts
that
had
followed
previous
interpretations
to
the
contrary
released
the
people
from
prison,
i
take
it,
who
were
convicted
at
trial
under
the
wrong
interpretation
and
also
let
them
withdraw
guilty
pleas
if
they
wanted
to.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
has
been
the
practice?
has...
you
started
out
by
saying,
it
has
been
the
practice
that
those
lower
courts
which
followed
the
erroneous
interpretation
would
automatically
let
a
person,
no
matter
how
long
he'd
been
in
prison,
i
guess...
he
comes
in,
he
says,
i
want
to
withdraw
my
plea
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
that's...
i'd
like
you
to
expound
on
that
a
little
bit.
what
has
been
the
practice?
