mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
has
been
alluded
to
on
a
number
of
occasions
already
this
morning
the
single
most
important
fact
in
this
case
is
that
this
petitioner,
pursuant
to
a
plea
agreement,
pleaded
guilty
to
the
gun
charge
in
open
court
under
oath
in
accordance
with
the
language
of
count
2
of
the
indictment,
which
accused
him
of
the
use
of
a
firearm
during
and
in
relation
to
a
drug
trafficking
crime.
now,
guilty
pleas
are
at
the
core
of
the
administration
of
our
criminal
justice
system.
some
75
to
90
percent
of
cases
being
resolved--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--henderson
v.
morgan
involved
a
case
where
the
petitioner
originally
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder
and
then,
without
ever
having
been
recharged,
pleaded
guilty
to
second
degree
murder.
the
indictment
was
never
changed.
he
was
never
charged
with
the
offense.
now,
by
contrast,
here,
this
defendant
pleaded
guilty
to--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--because
he
wasn't
apprised
of
the
charge
that
he
was
pleading
guilty
to.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
it
was
the
offense
itself,
your
honor.
i
mean,
he
was
charged
with
first
degree
murder
and
he
pleaded
guilty
to
second,
and
the
wilfulness
aspect
of
second
also
was
not
explained
to
him,
and
that
was
part
of
the
court's
reasoning.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no
one
told--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
that's
a
completely
different
case
here,
and
let
me
explain
what
this
defendant
knew,
because
the
government
seems
to
think
it's
very
important
what
this
particular
petitioner's
understanding
was,
and
that's
what
henderson
said.
if
he
has
such
an
incomplete
understanding
of
the
elements
of
the
offense,
then
we
have
to
take
a
hard
look
at
his
guilty
plea.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
i
wouldn't
go
that
far,
but--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
here,
this
defendant
was
charged
both
with
possession
of
originally
7
pounds
of
meth...
methamphetamine,
and
with
the
possession,
or
with
the
use
of
five
guns
during
and
in
relation
to
his
trafficking
in
those
drugs.
now,
in
that
scenario,
on
the
drug
count
alone
he
was
subjected
potentially
to
a
level
34
crime
which
could
have
brought
him
188
months...
when
you
take
into
account
the
two
level
enhancement
for
the
use
of
the
gun,
188
months
to
235
months
in
prison
on
the
drug
charge
alone.
now,
he
was
told
by
his
lawyer...
and
it's
in
the
record.
pages
133
to
143
of
the
appendix
in
this
court
show
that
there
was
a
dialogue
between
this
defendant
and
his
lawyer
about
the
elements
of
this
particular
gun
charge
and
the
lawyer
said,
i
have
told
you
repeatedly
that
section
924(c)
requires
more
than
possession,
and
the
petitioner
wrote
back
to
his
lawyer
and
said,
i
feel
so
strongly
i
am
not
guilty
of
the
use
of
a
firearm
that
there
is
a
good
chance
i
would
not
be
convicted
of
count
2.
that's
at
page
138
and
139
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
lawyer
said,
well,
under
present
eighth
circuit
law
i
think
you
would
be
convicted,
but
it
is
your
option,
if
you
so
desire,
to
move
to
set
aside
the
plea
and
go
to
trial
on
that
count,
and
for
good
reason,
as
part
of
a
plea
bargain,
the
defendant...
the
petitioner
decided
not
to
do
that.
and
what
did
he
get
in
return?
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
government
did
not
appeal
on
the
amount
of
drugs
that
were
found
he
got
the
right
to
contest
the
amount
of
drugs
with
which
he
was
going
to
be
charged,
and
that
ended
up
reducing
the
quantity
from
3,100
grams
to
less
than
1,000
grams,
so
instead
of
looking
at
a
level
34
sentence,
he
started
out
with
a
base
offense
level
of
30.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
and
at
page
28
of
the
colloquy,
your
honor,
the
defendant
starts
to
quarrel
with
the
court
about
what
access
he
actually
had
to
these
guns,
and
the
court
explains,
if
you
want
a
resolution
of
the
gun
issue
and
its
relation
to
the
drug
issue
and
whether
you
used
the
gun,
you
have
a
right
to
ask
for
a
jury
determination
of
that.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
she
talked
about
the
relationship
of
the
gun
to
the
drugs.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
she
said,
i
want
you
to
understand
that
if
you
want
to
contest
whether
the
guns
are
related
to
your
drug
trafficking
you
can
go
to
trial
to
do
that,
do
you
understand.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
that's--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--which--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i
think
that's
semantical
difference,
your
honor.
i
think
they
were
talking
about
the
same--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--if
the
ultimate
issue
is
whether
this
defendant
knew
what
he
was
charged
with,
clearly
the
indictment
in
this
case
charged
him
with
use,
and
that's
how
it's
different
from
henderson.
if
the
issue
is
whether
the
rule
11
colloquy
was
somehow
defective,
then
maybe
that's
a
different
issue,
but
that
doesn't
raise
a
constitutional
question,
and
that
has
been
the
fault--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
in
addition,
henderson
failed
to
explain
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
that
the
fellow
pleaded
guilty.
in
this
case--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i...
the
district
judge
can't
explain
the
law
in
terms
different
than
the
law
of
the
circuit
in
which
he
sits.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
that...
well,
i
don't
know
that
that
was
a
holding--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
whether
that
trumps
the
rule
that
the
defendant
takes
the
law
as
he
finds
it
when
he
decides
to
plead
guilty
is
a
different
question,
and
also--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
then
that
opens
up
pandora's
box
for--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--but
in
broce,
in
brady,
and
the--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
those
are
misinterpretations
of
the
legal
consequences
of
the
plea,
and
when
the
defendant
decides
to
take
his
chances
with
a
guilty
plea
and
save
as
much
as
10
or
12
years
off
a
drug
sentence
by
pleading
guilty
to
a
crime
that
he
may
not
be
guilty
of
by
his
own
acknowledgement
in
the
record...
people
plead
guilty
for
a
lot
of
different
reasons.
he
might
have
wanted
to
save
his
family
and
friends
the
embarrassment
or
the
humiliation
of
testifying.
he
might
have
wanted
to
avoid
dealing
with
his
source
for
these
drugs.
he
might
have
had
a
lot
of
reasons
for
wanting
to
put
finality
to
this
criminal
episode,
and
he
also
was
very
interested
in
trying
to
save
as
much
time
in
prison
as
he
could,
so
the
fact
that
at
the
time
he
may
have
miscalculated
the
consequences
of
his
actions
should
not
allow
him
8
years
later
to
come
in
and--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
he--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
he
was
advised
by
the
terms
of
the
indictment.
he
was
advised
by
the
terms
of
the
plea
agreement
that
he
signed,
which
is
written
in
terms
of
use
of
drugs.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
correct.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
no,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
i
would
think
that
the
public
does
have
an
interest
in
locking
up
people
who
are
trafficking
in
drugs,
and
even
more
so
people
who
have--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--and
who
use
guns--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
he
is
in
part.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
and
certainly
congress
could
have
made
mere
possession
in
connection
with
a
drug
trafficking
offense--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--it
didn't
yet,
right,
but
it
did
provide
for
an
enhancement
in
the
guidelines,
so
that
conduct
is
recognized
as
reprehensible,
because
it
gets
him
two
extra
levels
on
his
sentence
if
he's
found
with
guns,
even
if
he's
not
charged
under
924(c).
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
no,
but
we
can
take
that
into
account
in
seeing
whether
that's
conduct
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
punish.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
2-1/2
or
3,
yes,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
move,
if
i
could,
to
the
procedural
default
question,
because--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--constitutional
rules
of
procedure.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
to
the
extent
that
the
teague
progeny
have
been
developed
to
date,
i
would
agree
that
there
has
not
been
a
case
like
this.
i
would
suggest
that
the
distinction
to
date
has
been
between
the
constitutional
rules
teague
has
addressed
and
this
statutory
rule,
which
this
court
has
never
applied
teague
to
yet
because
it's
never
been
asked
to.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
under
teague
a
new
rule
is
one
that's
not
dictated
by
precedent,
and
bailey
clearly
was
not
dictated
by
precedent.
that
was
a
departure
from--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--absolutely.
we
think
this
case
should
be
subject
to
teague
and
should
be
teague
barred,
and
it's
a
small
step
in
our
view
from
the
cases
that
have
applied
teague
so
far
to
prisoners
on
death
row,
for
instance,
denying
them
retroactive
application
of
constitutional
provisions,
to
this
case,
which
simply
says
that
a
new
statutory
rule
won't
be
applied
retroactively.
but
if
i
could
talk
for
a
minute
about
procedural
default,
because
not
only
did
this
petitioner
commit
what
we
would
call
the
ultimate
act
of
procedural
default
by
pleading
guilty,
but
then
it
was
compounded
by
his
failure
to
appeal
on
the
gun
charge
after
he
was
convicted,
and
the
record
again
shows
that
he
knew
what
his
rights
were,
but
he
waived
them.
and
as
justice
o'connor
has
indicated,
there
was
plenty
of
litigation
going
on
around
the
country,
and
we
agree
with
the
government
that
there
is
no
cause
for
his
failure
to
assert
his
gun
rights
on
the
original
appeal.
it
was
not
futile,
and
even
perceived
futility
under
engle
v.
isaac
and
smith
v.
murray
is
not
cause,
so
he
procedurally
defaulted--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
i
think
as
far
as
procedural
default
is
concerned
i
would
have
the
same
analysis
there.
there
might
be
other
reasons
why
someone
under
that
kind
of
a
situation
might
be--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
as
far
as
if
a
statute
is
held
unconstitutional
the
blackledge
menna
exception
might...
might...
give
that
particular
petitioner
the
right
to
set
aside
the
guilty
plea,
but
that's...
blackledge
and
menna
don't
apply
to
this
situation.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
well,
that
would
be
a
novel
application
of
the
doctrine
of
actual
innocence,
justice
o'connor.
never
has
this
court,
first
of
all,
ever
applied
actual
innocence,
the
gateway
or
freestanding
actual
innocence,
to
a
situation
in
which
a
man
pleaded
guilty.
but...
and
the
actual
innocence
paradigm
that's
been
created
by
this
court
most
recently
in
schlup
just
simply
doesn't
fit
the
situation
where
you
have
a
plea
of
guilty,
because
in
that
case,
for
instance,
the
defendant--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
he'd--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--he'd
have
a
better
claim,
but
still,
this
isn't
actual
innocence
at
the
bottom.
actual
innocence
means,
i
didn't
do
this.
there's
a
dead
body
on
the
floor,
but
i
didn't
do
it.
prototypical
actual
innocence,
as
mentioned
by
this
court
in
one
of
its
cases
is,
they
got
the
wrong
man.
but
what
we're
talking
about
here,
at
best,
is
what
the
court
has
described
as
legal
innocence,
or
technical
innocence.
what
it
really
is
is
a
claim
that
the
evidence
was
insufficient
to
support
the
conviction,
whether
obtained
by
a
guilty
plea
or
by
jury
verdict.
this--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--right.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
i
think
he
just
felt
that
there
were
certain
primary
personal
rights
that
were
so
fundamental
that
they're
beyond
the
ability
of
congress
to
proscribe.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
that's
correct.
it
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court.
we've
cited
a
couple
of
cases
from--
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
--well,
some
of
the
lower
courts
have
refused
to
apply
decisions
like
bailey
retroactively,
relying
on
the
davis
case,
but
the
davis
case
is
a
total...
that's
a
total
misapplication
of
davis,
which
was
not
a
retroactivity
case
at
all
but
a
cognizability
case,
and
to
that
extent,
to
that
analysis
we
think
he's
just
wrong.
mr.
thomas
c.
walsh
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
