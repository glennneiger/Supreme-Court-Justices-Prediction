mr.
smith,
there...
this
petitioner
took
an
appeal,
did
he
not,
after
the
guilty
plea?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
he
was
convicted
not
only
of
this
924
charge,
use
of
a
firearm,
but
also
of
a
substantive
drug
offense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
appeal
was
from
the
conviction
of
the
substantive
drug
offense,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
petitioner
did
not
appeal
from
the
924(c)--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--conviction
and
sentence.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
presumably
that
was
waived,
and
at
the
time
he
chose
not
to
appeal,
assertions
were
being
made
all
over
the
country
by
defendants
that
924(c)
did
not...
was
not
a
mere
possession
statute.
i
mean,
those
claims
were
being
made
across
the
united
states,
but
this
defendant
did
not
raise
that
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
was
waived.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
is
he
stuck
with
that
waiver?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
defendant
could
have
taken
the
position,
as
many
defendants
all
across
the
country
were
doing
at
that
time,
that
the
statute
meant
something
else,
and
he
could
have
preserved
his
right
to
challenge
that
throughout.
i
mean,
that
was
happening
all
over
the
country,
but
this
defendant
didn't
do
that
and
i
think
that
leads
us
to
the
question
whether
he
should
be
held
to
the
waiver
or
the
procedural
default.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
he
says
actual
innocence.
he
says,
i
didn't...
here
were
these
drugs...
here
were
the
firearms
in
the
closet.
that's
what
the
factual
basis
showed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
actual
innocence,
he
says.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
that
be
defaulted
or
waived,
that
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
it...
can
he
get
through
that
gateway
in
a
situation
where
people
all
over
the
country
were
challenging
924(c)
on
what
it
meant...
hadn't
been
successful,
but
they
were
challenging
it,
and
he
chose
not
to.
he
didn't
appeal
on
this
ground.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
he
appealed
on
something
else.
now,
should
we
open
this
up
now--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--when
he
made
that
choice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
deal
with
the
argument
made
by
the
solicitor
general's
office
that
if
there...
there
is,
despite
the
waiver,
a
gateway
for
somebody
who
comes
in
with
a
colorable
claim
of
actual
innocence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
this
defendant
had
gone
to
trial
and
been
convicted,
would
you
be
here
making
this
same
argument,
or
would
you
say
under
these
circumstances
that
person
could
come
in
with
his
claim
of
actual
innocence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
guilty
plea.
he
went
to
trial.
