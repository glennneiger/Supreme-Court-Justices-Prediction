chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-8516,
kenneth
eugene
bousley
v.
united
states.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
a
decision
by
this
court,
you
know,
it
is...
it
speaks
finally
to
what
the
law
means,
but
it
doesn't
simply
change
the
legal
world
that
existed
3
years
before,
where
several
courts
of
appeals
may
have
said
exactly
the
opposite.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we...
one
of
the
reasons
we
grant
certiorari
on
a
statutory
question
is
there's
a
difference
of
opinion
among
the
courts
of
appeals,
so
many
of
the
criminal
statutes
we
decide
are
here
solely
because
one
court
of
appeals
takes
one
position
and
another
court
of
appeals
takes
another,
so
it's
not
as
if
this
is
going
to
be
limited
to
the
bailey
type
situation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
now,
most
statutes
have
several
elements,
you
know.
you
have
a
certain
intent,
a
general
intent,
mens
rea...
now,
the
next
lawyer
who
comes
before
us
for
the
city
is
going
to
say,
well,
it's
the
intent
that's
the
critical
element.
you
really
can't
say
that
one
element
is
more
critical
than
the
other,
can
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
do
you
say
this...
this
particular
element,
possession,
that
sort
of
thing,
is
critical,
whereas
there
are
other
elements
of
the
crime,
too,
the
intent
with
which
you
have
to
do
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they're
all
critical?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
dreeben,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
they'll
all
have
to
go
back
and
reconstruct
a
factual
situation
that
may
have
occurred
years
ago.
i
can
imagine
the
petitioner
taking
this
position,
but
i'm
surprised
to
see
the
government
taking
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
justice
holmes
said
that
law
is
what
the
courts
say
it
is,
and
he
wasn't
speaking
only
of
this
court.
i
mean,
the
idea
that
there's
some
sort
of
an
abstract
law
up
there
in
the
sky
that
is
finally
delineated
by
this
court
is...
really
doesn't
correspond
with
reality
in
many
senses.
certainly,
this
court
is
the
final
expositor
of
the
law,
but
there
are
all
sorts
of
other
courts
in
the
meantime
that
are
handing
down
decisions
saying
what
a
particular
statute
means,
and
the
idea
that
when
we
say
it
means
this,
that
everything
that
happened
in
the
past
is
simply
washed
out
is,
i
think,
extraordinary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
walsh,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walsh.
you
were
appointed
as
amicus
by
the
court,
and
the
court
wishes
to
express
its
appreciation
to
you
for
your
service.
