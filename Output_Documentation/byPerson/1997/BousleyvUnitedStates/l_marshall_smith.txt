mr.
l.
marshall
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
an
unusual
case
in
that
it
may
fairly
be
said
that
this
defendant
is
in
prison
for
acts
that
do
not
amount
to
a
crime.
this
court's
unanimous
opinion
in
the
bailey
case
made
it
clear
that
mere
possession
of
weapons
near
drugs
does
not
amount
to
use
under
the
federal
statute
under
which
mr.
bousley
was
convicted.
it
is
at
the
core
of
habeas
corpus
jurisprudence
to
release
prisoners
who
are
held
without
legal
authority.
mr.
bousley
is
in
this
position
because
at
the
time
he
entered
his
guilty
plea
to
the
charge
under
924(c)
the
charges
had
been
explained
to
him
in
language
of
possession.
however,
the
bailey
case
makes
it
clear
that
one
cannot
be
convicted
of
this...
violating
this
statute
lest
there's
been
proof
of
active
employment.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
your
honor,
it's
not...
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that,
your
honor.
there's
much
more
to
it
than
that.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
that's
correct,
the
argument
would
be
the
same.
the
difficulty
here
is
that
it's
not
just
the
colloquy
but
it's
the
entire
presentation
of
the
nature
of
the
charges
to
mr.
bousley
led
him
to
believe
and,
indeed,
caused
the
reflection
that
this
was
a
mere
possession
crime,
rather
than
an
active
employment
crime.
as
a
result,
his
guilty
plea
cannot
be
construed
as--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--yes,
your
honor,
certainly
the
colloquy
was--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--that's
correct,
but
again,
in
order
for
a
guilty
plea
to
be
valid,
it
must
be
knowledgeable
and
it
must
be
intelligent
and
when
the
crime
is
explained
as
something
other
than
what
the
statute
actually
describes,
the
plea
cannot
be
intelligent
or
knowing,
because
the
defendant
is
not
aware
and
because
the
presentation
does
not
comply
with
the
statute,
so
it's
more
than
just
a
rule
11
violation.
it's--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--he
did
sign
the
plea
agreement.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
no.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
the
plea
agreement
uses
the
word
use.
the
plea
agreement,
however,
describes
the
nature
of
the
conduct
that
amounts
to
use
as
ownership
and
possession,
and
this
is
consistent
throughout
the
proceedings
that--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
it's...
use
is
merely
the
label
for
the
crime.
that's
not
the
critical
element.
the
critical
element
of
the
crime
is
active
employment
and,
as
the
bailey
case--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--no,
but
it--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--yes,
your
honor.
now,
the
difficulty
is,
if
a
defendant
is
told
the
label
for
the
crime
but
not
the
elements,
as
in
the
henderson
and
morgan
case,
it's
not
possible
to
appreciate
what
actually
is
involved
for
a
conviction
and
therefore
the
plea
cannot
be
knowing
and
intelligent.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
it
was
couched
in
terms
of
possession,
your
honor
and
the
notion
of
active
employment
was
not
referred
to
at
all
during
this
proceedings.
the
only
reference
was
to
possession
as
being
the
critical
element
in
this
charge.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
that's
what
all
participants
thought.
it
turns
out
that
that
was
incorrect,
because,
as
the
court
well
knows,
section
924
requires
proof
of
active
employment
rather
than
mere
possession.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
i
think
that
would
be
a
much
harder
case,
your
honor,
than
the
one
we
have
here.
however,
the
test,
as
reflected
in
the
henderson
and
morgan
case,
is
whether
under
all
of
the
circumstances
there's
been
an
adequate
explanation
of
the
crucial
elements
of
the
charge
and,
under
your
hypothetical,
it's
quite
likely
that
the
defendant
would
not
have
had
an
adequate
explanation
even
in
that
situation.
here,
of
course,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
explanation
did
not
match
the
critical
element
of
use
as
it's
defined
under
section
92--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--well--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--well,
your
honor,
i
have
to
disagree
with
the
notion
that
this
was
the
current
law.
it
was
what
the
eighth
circuit
had
described
the
law
as.
however,
when
section
924(c)
was
enacted,
the
bailey
case
makes
it
clear
that
possession,
mere
possession
was
never
a
crime
and,
in
fact,
to
the
extent
that
there
is
any
such
thing,
or
ever
was
any
such
thing
as
possession
of
a
weapon
near
drugs,
that's
a--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
what
it
does
do
is
create
a
class
of
defendants
who
are
in
prison
for
acts
that
congress
has
never
made
into
a
crime,
and--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--well,
i
understand
your
point,
your
honor,
and
i
would
say
that
in
order
to
test
the
validity
of
the
plea,
the
appropriate
standard
ought
to
be
what
the
statute
actually
says.
once
one
departs--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--the
law
at
the
time,
your
honor,
was
what
section
924(c)
says.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
no,
your
honor.
the
law
has--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
the
law
has
always
been,
under
section
924(c),
that
mere
possession
does
not
violate
that
code
section.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
well--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--actually,
your
honor,
what
we're
pointing
out
here
is
that
in
these
unusual
situations,
when
a
bailey
case
happens...
and
they
don't
happen
very
often.
ordinarily
the
circuit
courts
are
quite
effective
in
doing
a...
in
explaining
what
the
congressional
intent
is
and
what
the
statute
actually
says.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
certainly,
your
honor,
if
there
had
been
many
of
those,
but
the
fact
is
there
have
not
been
many.
this
just
doesn't
happen
very
often.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
well,
except
for
this,
your
honor,
and
this
is
an
important
distinction.
the
thing
that
makes
bailey
different
from
other
statutory
construction
cases
is,
this
is
not
just
any
construction
of
the
statute.
this
is
the
critical...
the
critical
element
in
the
statute,
which
is
possession
versus
active
employment.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
well,
i...
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that
one
element
is
more
critical
than
the
other.
what
i
am
saying,
however,
is
that
when
the
critical
element
has
been
misapplied,
as
it
was
in
this
case--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--yes.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
well,
i
can't
say
whether
they're
all
critical
until
i
would
see
them,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
what
makes
up
the
crime
when
you
put
them
together,
and
i
would
distinguish
this
from
the
situation
where
a
court
determines,
for
example,
that
an
affirmative
defense
might
or
might
not
be
recognized.
additionally,
your
honor...
and
justice
scalia,
to
respond
to
your
concern...
when
cases
such
as
this
are
sought
to
be
reopened
at
the
district
court
level
it's
not,
certainly,
an
automatic
situation
where
there
would
be,
the
guilty
plea
would
be
set
aside.
the
district
judge
would
have
to
take
into
account
all
of
the
facts,
as
he's,
or
she
is
entitled
to
do
under
2255,
and
determine--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--well,
except,
your
honor,
what--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--the
invalidity
of
the
plea
on
the
basis
of
the
inaccurate
description
would,
i
believe,
fit
within
the
second
question,
although
it's
not
specifically
described
there,
so
your
honor
is
correct
in
that
regard.
this--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--he
did,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
yes,
it
was.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
correct.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
well,
i--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--i
would
argue
that
he
did
not
waive
it,
but
if
it
were
determined
that
he
did
based
on
your
honor's
position,
i
would
argue
that
he
should
not
be
stuck
with
that
for
three
important
reasons.
first,
the
notion
of
procedural
default,
which
is
what
it's
been
labeled,
in
a
sense
this
is
bringing
it
full
circle
and
perhaps
makes
a
somewhat
perverse
use
of
the
doctrine,
because
here's
a
defendant
who's
attempting
to
establish
his
actual
innocence,
and
what's
placed
in
front
of
him
is
a
procedural
bar
that
prevents
him
from
establishing
that.
when
a
defendant
is
in
this
situation
where
the
statute
as
interpreted
now
makes
it
clear
that
his
conduct
simply
did
not
violate
the
statute,
the
notion
of
default
should
not
be
applied,
and
the
notion
of
cause,
as
that's
been
found
in
this
court's
prior
jurisprudence,
certainly
should
be
found
because
of
the
string
of
eighth
circuit
opinions
which
would
have
prevented
mr.
bousley
from
knowing
that
he
had
the
opportunity
to
bring
this,
as
well
as
what
the
trial
court
told
him.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
with
this
case,
however,
it's
different,
your
honor,
in
that
what
we're
speaking
here
about
is
the
critical
element
of
the
crime.
that's
what's
different.
those...
the
cases
that
have
been--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--that's...
that's--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--it's
quite
different,
your
honor,
however,
when
the
actual
element
of
the
crime
is
one
that's
never
been
enacted
by
congress,
and
which
forms
the
basis
for
the
petitioner's
imprisonment,
is
something
that's
never
actually
been
a
crime
at
all,
and
that's
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
i--
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
--the
difference,
however,
your
honor,
is
that
as
a
matter
of
process
and
procedure
here
it's
clear
that
the
district
court
was
applying
the
improper
element
from
the
very
beginning
and
the
explanation
was
improper
from
the
very
beginning.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
i'd
say
two
things.
there's
an
important
principle
which
is
that,
because
this
defendant
is
actually
innocent
here
of
the
charge,
he
ought
not
be
held
to
the
waiver.
there's
also
a
very
practical
problem
with
taking
the
position
that
he
should
have
raised
this
on
appeal
when
there
was
uniform
eighth
circuit
precedent
to
the
contrary.
if
the
court
wishes
to
encourage
guilty
pleas
and
to
encourage
people
to
accept
settled
precedent,
the
appropriate
thing
to
do
is
to
accept
the
law
as
it
is
and
in
these
unusual
circumstance,
when
it
turns
out
that
there
have
been
a
series
of
mistakes
made,
to
allow
the
remedy
which
mr.
bousley
seeks
here,
the
remedy
of
habeas
corpus,
rather
than
saying
to
defendants,
bring
up
these
appeals
every
single
time
you
have
the
opportunity,
don't
take
guilty
pleas,
don't
accept
the
law
as
it
is,
constantly
challenge
it.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
i
would
not
agree
with
the
notion
that
it
should
be
reopened
because
there
has
been
a
full
blown
hearing
at
which
there
was
an
opportunity
to
present
all
the
relevant
facts.
in
an
appropriate
case,
however,
the
district
court
may
determine
that
some
remedy
along
the
lines
that
you
describe
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
l.
marshall
smith
so
the
government
says
now,
your
honor.
however,
the
government
has
not
pointed
out
any
basis
upon
which
an
appeal
from
that
factual
finding
could
have
been
made
and,
indeed,
there
was
already
an
appeal
made
by
the
defendant
on
that
very
issue,
that
is,
the
drug
quantity
and
the
propriety
of
a
sentence--
