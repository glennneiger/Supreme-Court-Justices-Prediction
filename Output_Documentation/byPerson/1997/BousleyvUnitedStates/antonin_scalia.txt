justice
antonin
scalia
now,
if
he
hadn't
been
told
this,
but
was...
by
the
court
but
was
advised
to
that
effect
by
his
lawyer
and
had
his
own
misimpression
as
to
what
the
law
meant,
would
you
have
a
solid
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
can't
demand
that
the
trial
judge
do
more
than
nature
allows.
he
gave
a
description
of
the
crime
that
was
the
generally
understood
description.
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
to
say
it
was
misdescribed
according
to
what
the
law
was
at
the
time
and
then
you
could
invoke
rule
11
and
say
the
court
wasn't
doing
its
job.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
here,
the
court
did
its
best
on
the
basis
of
the
current
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
wanted
this
district
judge
to
instruct
in
the
rule
11
colloquy
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
circuit
in
which
he
sits?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you
want
these...
i
guess
each
district
judge
would
have
to
just
sit
back
and
figure
out
what
he
thinks
the
law
is,
never
mind
what
his
court
of
appeals
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
won't
happen
very
often
in
the
future,
because
we
will
be
very,
very
reluctant
to
set
aside
a
longstanding
misinterpretation
by
the
court
of
appeals
if
the
consequence
is
going
to
be
that
every
guilty
plea
rendered
during
that
period
is
invalidated.
i
mean,
don't
you
see
that
as
a
risk
for
the
legal
system?
i
certainly
would
give
great
second
thought
to
setting
aside
any
longstanding
misinterpretation
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smith,
i
think
we
often
apply
the
doctrine
of
procedural
default
when
its
consequence
is
to
exclude
a
claim
of
actual
innocence.
i
mean,
that's
not
at
all
unusual.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
no
different.
i
mean,
in
some
cases...
let's
assume
a
witness
was
improperly
excluded
by
the
trial
court
and
that
witness
would
have
shown
the
nonexistence
of
one
of
the
elements
of
the
crime--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you
know,
if
it
hasn't
been
raised
on
appeal,
and
he
says
i'm
innocent,
and
this
witness
would
have
shown
i'm
innocent
because
one
of
the
crucial
elements
of
the
crime
didn't
exist,
we
would
say,
well,
you
should
have...
you
know,
we
have
a
trial
system
and
you
have
to
play
by
the
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
the
hypothetical
i
gave
you
he
is
going...
gone
to
jail
for
doing
something
that
congress
did
not
say
is
a
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
one
of
the
elements
that
congress
prescribed
was
not...
you
know,
he
was
not
given
a
chance
to
deny
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dreeben,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
exaggerate
the
extent
to
which
bailey
makes
this
a
unique
case.
as
the
chief
justice's
question
suggests,
if
the
government
takes
the
position
it
has
taken
on
the
validity
of
the
plea
agreement,
it
seems
to
me
that
position
will
have
to
be
applied
not
just
in
a
case
like
this
where
the
circuits
were
at
one
time
virtually
uniform,
but
in
the
case
of
any
circuit
split
you
would
have
to
invalidate
all
of
the
plea
agreements
in
that
half
of
the
circuit
split
that
ultimately
loses,
because
the
district
judges
in
that
half
of
the
circuits
will
have
been
instructing
the...
in
the
rule
11
colloquy
according
to
the
law
of
their
circuit,
and
would
not
all
of
those
plea
agreements
be
invalid
whenever
it
turns
out
that
the
element
of
the
crime
in
question
is
as
the
other
circuits
have
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
one
way
to
go,
and
another
way
to
go
is
to
adopt
the
rule
that
when
you
plead
guilty
to
the
text
of
a
statute,
you
take
your
chances
as
to
whether
the
interpretation
of
that
statute
that
you
have
assumed
is
correct
or
not.
the
mistake
of
law
is
washed
out
by
your
agreement.
that's
what
a
voluntary
agreement
is
all
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
different
if
the...
you
know,
if
the
court
or
your
lawyer
told
you
something
that
was
contrary
to
what
seemed
to
be
the
law
in
the
circuit
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
have
no
problem
with
the
people
who
were
convicted
protesting
their
innocence
all
along,
had
the
same
rule
been
applied
to
all
those
who
pleaded
guilty
to
the
statute
and
in
my
view
took
their
chances
as
to
what
the
proper
meaning
of
the
statute
was.
