and
isn't
it
the
case
here
that
all
participants,
the
judge,
the
prosecutor
and
the
defendant,
all
of
them
in
fact
understood
that
the
crime
was
possession,
availability
of
guns
and
not
active
use,
and
that's
what
the
judge
explained
to
the
defendant?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
it
true
that
that
would
be...
of
every
essential
element...
imagine
the
case
going
to
trial.
the
judge
charges
the
jury,
in
order
to
convict
you
must
find
a,
b,
and
c.--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
one
is
no
more
or
less
important
than
the
other,
but
it's
what
the
law
calls
an
essential
element,
something
the
jury
must
find.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
other
side
of
the
bargain?
i
mean,
the
prosecutor
didn't
appeal
from
the
amount
of
drugs
that
the
judge
determined
in
part
because
there
had
been
this
bargain
on
the
924(c).
if
you
are
right,
doesn't
that
have
to
be
reopened,
too,
so
that
the
prosecutor
has
a
chance
to
contest
the
amount
of
drugs?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
didn't
the
government
say,
in
this
very
case,
that
the
reason
we
didn't
appeal
on
the
drug
part
of
the...
at
least
in
part
was
that
we
had
this
defendant
on
the
924(c)
charge?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
were
cases
in
the
wake
of
ratzlaf,
were
there
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
walsh,
you're
explaining
things
that
went
on
behind
the
scenes,
but
the
scene
itself
in
the
courtroom
was
a
judge
asking
the
defendant,
do
you
know
what
you
were
charged
with?
defendant
answers,
possession
of
a
firearm.
judge
murphy
then
says,
okay,
if...
the
indictment
charges
you
with
possessing
the
firearms
during
a
drug
trafficking
offense.
so
in
open
court
he
is
told
by
the
judge...
he
pleads
to
something
called
possession
of
a
firearm.
the
judge
affirms
that
the
charge
is
possessing
a
firearm.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
where
did
she
say
use
the
gun?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
she
had
in
her
mind
that
the
crime
was
possession
and
proximity.
i
was
not
aware
that
she
had
at
any
point
used
the
word
used.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
related
to
the
drug
trafficking,
and
that's
what
she
explained
to
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
possession
and
proximity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
not
active
use.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
semantical
difference?
it's
what
meant
the
difference
between
committing
a
crime
and
not
committing
a
crime
in
bailey,
and
in
slews
of
cases
that
were
backed
up
behind
it,
so
it's
hardly
a
semantical
difference
whether
the
crime
is
possession
of
guns
in
proximity
to
drugs
and,
as
explained
in
the
bailey
opinion,
actively
using
the
gun.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
about
3
years
difference,
isn't
it--
--right,
yes.
--between
the
enhancement
and
being
convicted
of
a
substantive
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
just
one
question
also
on
a
procedural
line,
because
i
understood
your
brief
to
make
no
distinction,
as
i
thought
our
cases
had,
in
the
so
called
teague
bar
between
a
procedural
issue...
i
think
teague
itself
uses
the
word
procedural.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
procedure...
of
procedure,
and
something
that
is
substantive.
here
we're
not
talking
about
any
slip
or
change
in
the
law
about
procedure.
we're
talking
about
a
definition
of
what
the
crime
is,
and
i
had
not
seen
teague
applied
to
the
substance,
as
distinguished
from
the
procedure.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
we
never...
don't
talk
about
what
the
crime
is
as
being
a
new
rule.
maybe
there
was
merely
a
misconstruction,
but
it's
not...
the
notion
that...
not
the
common
law
that
you
pull
down
from
the
sky,
but
words
that
congress
used
to
define
an
offense,
we
haven't,
to
my
knowledge,
spoken
about
this
court's
interpretation
as
a,
quote,
new
rule.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
are
you
urging
that
we
extend...
i
mean,
you've
been
candid
in
saying
we
haven't...
we...
that
teague
itself
uses
the
word
procedural.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
would
you
distinguish
a
case
like...
post
lopez,
suppose
somebody...
direct
appeal
time
is
over,
applies
under
2255
to
be
released
because
he
was
convicted
of
the
crime
of
carrying
a
gun
within
x
distance
of
a
school?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
do
you
distinguish
these
two
cases,
or
do
you
say
they're
saying
too
bad,
you
entered
a
plea,
even
though
the
supreme
court
said
that
that's
not...
that
can't...
not
only
it's
not
a
crime,
but
can't
be
a
crime?
