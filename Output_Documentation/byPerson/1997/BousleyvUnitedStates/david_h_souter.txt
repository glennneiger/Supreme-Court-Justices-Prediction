justice
david
h.
souter
well,
may
i
ask
you
this.
when
the
factual
basis
for
the
plea
was
stated,
was
that
factual
basis
couched
in
terms
of
use,
active
employment
in
the
sense
that
bailey
described,
or
was
it
couched
in
terms
of
mere
possession?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
dreeben,
you've
made
out
a
perfectly
good
case
for
saying
that
we
ought
to
look
at
the
voluntariness
of
the
plea
in
the
light
of
the
final
resolution
of
what
the
elements
of
the
crime
are,
but
there
is
a
case
for
looking
at
it
the
other
way
and
saying
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
if,
at
least
under
the
prevailing
or
the
unobjected
to
law
at
the
time
of
the
plea,
it
was
properly
done.
what's
the
government's...
what
is
your
best
reason
for
saying
we
ought
to
look
at
it
your
way
rather
than
look
at
it
the
way
that
if
it
was
okay
at
the
time,
no
constitutional
violation?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
that...
isn't
that
really
an
equivocation?
sure,
the
word
use
was
employed,
but
the
explanation
that
was
given
to
him,
and
the
explanation
that
was
presupposed
by
the
statement
of
factual
basis,
was
not
use
as
we
defined
it
in
bailey.
it
was
in
effect
proximity
of
possession,
so
that
he
was
not
told
about
use
as
bailey
described
and
defined
use,
was
he?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
let
me
try
a
different
hypothetical.
let
me
go
part
way
with
your
argument,
and
let
me
assume
that
there
certainly
are
some
cases
in
which,
if...
i'll
take
a
holmesian
view
that
the
law
changed
when
bailey
came
down,
and
i
will
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
there
are
a
class
of
cases
in
which
we
shouldn't
disturb
the
plea
simply
because
the
elements
were
explained
improperly,
as
understood
by
hindsight.
the
distinction
i
want
to
test
out
is
this.
i
suppose
there
are...
you
know,
there
are
infinite
varieties
of
mistakes
in
the
plea
colloquys,
but
one
broad
distinction
would
be
this.
in
some
cases,
the
law
is
explained
to
a
defendant
who
wishes
to
plead
in
a
way
that
simply
does
not
make
it
clear
what
the
distinction
is
between
the
offense
that
he's
charged
with
and
some
related
offense,
first
degree
murder,
second
degree
murder,
that
sort
of
thing.
in
another
class
of
cases,
of
which
this
is
supposedly
one,
there
is
no
other
offense,
so
that
if
he
pleads
guilty
to
this
kind
of...
under
these
circumstances,
he's
pleading
guilty
to
something
which
under
no
possible
set
of
legal
facts
would
be
punishable.
shouldn't
a
distinction
be
drawn
between
those
two
kinds
of
plea
cases,
the
argument
being
that
in
the
first
class
of
cases
the
public
has
a...
at
least
an
interest
in
having
murderers
generally
locked
up,
but
there
is
no
discernible
public
interest,
or
no
serious
public
interest
in
locking
up
people
for
something
which
is
not
a
crime
by
anyone's
definition,
and
for
conduct
which
does
not
fit
within
a
crime
by
anybody's
definition.
would
you
admit
that
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
for
trafficking...
for
trafficking
in
drugs,
that's
right,
and
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
that's...
but
he's
not
being
locked
up
here
for
trafficking
in
drugs.
justice
david
h.
souter
to
the
extent
that
we
are
concerned
with
his
lock
up,
we're
concerned
with
his
lock
up
for
the
firearms
offense.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
didn't.
it
didn't.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
you're
saying
the
government...
i
don't...
i
think
you're
saying
that
the
government's
interest
is
sufficiently
weighty
because
we
can
more
or
less
equate
a
guidelines
enhancement
with
conviction
for
a
separate
crime.
that...
you
don't
mean
that.
