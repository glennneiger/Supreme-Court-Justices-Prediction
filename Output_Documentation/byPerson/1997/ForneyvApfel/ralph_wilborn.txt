mr.
ralph
wilborn
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
social
security
benefits
claimant
may
appeal
a
final
judgment
entered
under
the
fourth
sentence
of
42
u.s.
code
405(g)
when
that
final
judgment
is
accompanied
by
an
order
of
remand.
now,
in
finkelstein,
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs,
this
court
held
that
such
a
judgment
is
a
final
judgment
which
terminates
the
civil
action,
and
that
the
agency,
not
the
claimant,
may
appeal
therefrom.
in
fact,
in
a
footnote
in
finkelstein
this
court
expressly
reserved
addressing
whether
or
not
the
claimant
had
the
right
to
appeal
from
such
a
judgment.
this
case
squarely
presents
that
issue.
apart
from
finkelstein,
in
schaefer,
also
cited
in
the
briefs,
this
court
construed,
in
the
context
of
an
equal
access
to
justice
act
claim,
the
same
statute
without
qualifying
it
in
terms
of
whether
the
petitioner...
the
judgment
was
final
for
the
social
security
administration
only.
we
believe
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
and
the
text
and
structure
of
the
statute
established
that
either
party
may
appeal.
in
fact,
if
you
look
at
amicus'
brief
which
was
invited
by
the
court
their
entire
argument,
or
all
of
their
arguments
ultimately
loop
back
to
the
point
or
the
misconception
that
petitioner
can
later
appeal
any
aspect
of
the
instant
district
court
case
following
the
remand
proceedings.
in
other
words,
they're
trying
to
tie
that
into
the
idea
that
the
petitioner
is
not
aggrieved
currently.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
that
is
exactly
my
position.
i
do
not
believe
that,
under
the
way
the
statute
is
worded
that
we
would
have,
the
petitioner
would
have
the
right
to
appeal
the
current
civil...
or
the
current
administrative
finding.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
justice
ginsburg,
yes,
that
is
absolutely
correct
as
far
as
ordinary
civil
procedure
as
it
applies
to
interlocutory
orders
of
remand.
in
this
case,
however,
the
statute
gives
us
a
final
judgment,
and
it
then...
sentence
8
of
the
statute...
by
the
way,
the
statute
is
set
out
in
full--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--yes.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
yes,
that's
absolutely
right,
justice
kennedy.
finkelstein
does
run
against
that,
and
it's
interesting
and
i
think
significant
that
in
finkelstein
this
court
chose
not
to
adopt
the
collateral
doctrine
rule
set
out
in
the
cohen
case.
instead,
it
directly
interpreted
the
language
of
the
statute
as
giving
it
final--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
we
believe
we
are
in
a
similarly
situated
profile
here.
just
as
it
was
possible
that
the
secretary
in
finkelstein
might
never
have
the
opportunity
to
appeal
that,
or
would
lack
standing
if
they
paid
benefits
on
remand,
it
is
possible.
now,
it
was
also
possible
that
the
secretary
could
have
actually
denied
benefits
on
remand
and
then
come
up
to
federal
court
to
relitigate
that
issue,
so
it
was
possible
that
the
secretary--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--no,
justice
ginsburg.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
even
had
the
secretary
complied
with
the
district
court's
order
in
finkelstein,
it
is
possible
that
the
facts
could
have
still
allowed
the
secretary,
even
construing
the
regulations
against
their
wishes,
to
have
denied
the
case,
and
if
they
had
denied
the
claim
in
finkelstein,
that
would
have
preserved
the
issue
to
come
back--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--that's
the
possibility,
and
i
believe
that's
why
we
have
a
similar
situation
here.
it
is
possible--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
reason
we
believe
we
cannot
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
following
remand
is
because
this
section,
405(g),
sentence
1,
which
grants
jurisdiction
to
the
district
court
to
review
the
final
judgment
of
the
secretary,
or
the
commissioner
now,
expressly
limits
the
subsequent
review
in
light
of
finkelstein
saying,
this
civil
action,
the
judgment,
the
sentence
4
judgment
terminates
the
civil
action.
it
goes
back
on
remand,
and
we
must
then
file
a
new
civil
action.
the
findings
change
on
remand,
the
law
applicable
to
that
finding,
to
those
findings
changes
on
remand,
so
when
we
come
back
up
with
a
second
final
agency
decision
under
sentence
1
of
405(g)
we
are
not
permitted
to
appeal
anything
except
the
new
secretary's,
or
commissioner's
final
decision.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
justice
souter,
i
think
if
i
answer
your
question,
i
will
also
answer
mr.
chief
justice's
question.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
so
if
we
take...
take
as
an
example
the
case
we
have
before
us,
forney.
we
believe
that
she
stood
in
the
posture
under
the
facts
of
her
case,
that
the
facts
justified
the
district
court
taking
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
under
section
405(g)
to
reverse
without
a
remand.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
from
a
legal...
based
upon
the
law
of
the
circuit.
if
that
is
true,
but
she
goes
back
on
remand
to
do
whatever
the
administrative
agency
does
on
remand,
which
was
not
specifically
defined
by
the
district
court's
remand--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--it
is
a
new
action.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
so
the
current
civil
action
terminates.
we
then
go
back,
we
perhaps
introduce...
we
and
the
commissioner
both,
or
one
or
either
of
us,
introduce
new
medical
evidence,
new
vocational
evidence.
that
changes
the
entire
factual
posture
of
the
case.
suppose
we
lose
on
remand.
then
we
come
back
up
through
the
appellate...
the
administrative
agency
to
district
court
under
sentence
1
of
405(g),
which
is
set
out
at
page
2
of
our
opening
brief.
sentence
1
grants
jurisdiction
to
the
district
court
to
review
such
decision,
the
new
decision.
we
have
to
file
a
brand
new
civil
action.
unlike--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--i
don't
believe
that
is
the
reason,
justice
souter.
i
think
the
reason
is
that
because
we
have
a
final
judgment
which
terminates
the
civil
action,
if
we
don't
appeal
that
and
we
go
back
to...
for
additional
proceedings
on
remand,
what
we
end
up
with
is
a
brand-new
case
that
comes
up.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
yes.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
that
is
how
i
understand
the
government's
position
as
well--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--justice
scalia.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
that
is
under
the
current
state
of
the
law,
because
under
sentence
8
it
says
that
our
judgment
is
appealable,
as
in
any
other
civil
action,
and
in
any
other
civil
action
if
we
don't
appeal--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--collateral
estoppel
does
come
into
play.
however,
we
certainly
wouldn't
object
to
the
government
fashioning
a
rule
where...
which
favors
claimants
that
they
would
apply--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--absolutely.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
not
if
we
stay
with
the
strict
language
of
the
statute.
it's--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
believe
that
that
likelihood
is
very
probable,
for
the
reasons
set
out
in
the
brief.
but
in
addition,
if
the
government
does
as
they
have
extended
the
offer
they
simply
don't
hold
against
the
claimant
who
chooses
not
to
appeal.
if
they
don't
hold
collateral
estoppel
in
an
offensive
fashion
against
the
claimant,
then
the
claimant
has
a
freer
mind
to
make
the
rational
choice,
do
i
appeal
or
do
i
not.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
that's
correct.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
it
is
an
affirmative
defense
that
if
the
government
chooses
to
waive,
as
apparently
they
have
done,
that
only
benefits
claimants,
and
it
would...
if
there
is
any
danger
of
this
opening
the
floodgates
after
finkelstein
nearly
8
years
ago
said
this
was
a
possibility,
and
then
after
schaefer
pretty
much
affirmed
that,
and
then
in
the
tenth
circuit
in
the
nguyen
case
cited
in
the
briefs,
no
one
in
the
tenth
circuit
has
done
this
again.
apparently
i'm
a
sole
practitioner
who
does
this.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
yes.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
justice
breyer,
that's
exactly
correct.
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
the
tenth
circuit
nguyen
case.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
it's
a
major
risk.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
because
i
am
concerned
that
if
we
don't
appeal
now...
the
facts
are
so
favorable
for
us,
and
she
is
a
younger
individual
with
an
unpopular
illness,
that
if
she
doesn't
take
it
up
now,
the
facts
on
remand
will
be
even
worse
for
her.
if
i
have
any
time
left,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
for
rebuttal.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
just
wanted
to
clarify
that
justice
scalia's
characterization
of
what's
going
on
here
a
minute
ago
is
exactly
what's
going
on
here.
we
are
concerned
that
on
remand
the
facts
will
change
and
we'll
have
a
different
case.
it
is
also
our
position
that
we
do
waive
the
right
to
appeal
the
instant
case
if
we
do...
if
we
choose
to
accept
the
remand
proceedings.
the
nature
of
the
case
coming
up
on
remand
will
be
totally
different.
res
judicata
will
bar
us
from
subsequently
raising...
if
we
had,
for
example,
three
or
four
remands
to
the
agency,
and
all
of
those
were
preserved
so
that
we
could
argue
one,
two,
three,
four
seriatim
upon
appeal
to
the
circuit
courts,
that
would
just
swamp
the
courts.
that
would
not
be
sensible,
and
that's
not--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--i'm
not
aware
that
it
ever
was,
justice
ginsburg,
although
it
may
be--
mr.
ralph
wilborn
--yes.
mr.
ralph
wilborn
justice
ginsburg
is
no
longer
a
court
of
appeals
judge,
or
she
wouldn't--
[laughter]
mr.
ralph
wilborn
thank
you.
