ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
two
requirements
that
must
be
met
for
a
party
to
appeal
a
district
court's
judgment
under
section
1291.
first,
the
judgment
must
be
final
and,
second,
the
party
must
be
aggrieved
by
the
judgment.
as
to
finality,
this
court
concluded
in
both
schaefer
and
finkelstein
that
under
the
fourth
and
eighth
sentences
of
section
405(g)
a
district
court's
order
of
remand
is
a
final
judgment.
as
to
aggrievement,
the
district
court's
decision
is
partially
favorable
to
petitioner
to
the
extent
that
it
sets
aside
the
commissioner's
decision
and
it
remands
for
further
proceedings,
but
that
judgment
is
unfavorable
to
petitioner
to
the
extent
that
it
denies
her
the
outright
reversal
that
she
seeks,
and
that's
a
greater
form
of
relief.
therefore,
because
petitioner
is
not
a
fully
prevailing
party
she's
aggrieved
by
the
district
court's
judgment
and
has
a
statutory
right
of
appeal.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--in
our
view
the...
it
had
to
have
been--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
in
our
view,
the
general
understanding
is,
when
you
talk
about
the
word
aggrievement
you
compare
the
judgment
entered
with
the
judgment
that
was
sought,
and
in
this
case
petitioner
pled
in
the
alternative
as
a
greater
form
of
relief.
she
wanted
a
outright
reversal
and
a
remand
for
the
immediate
payment
of
benefits.
in
the
alternative,
as
a
lesser
relief,
she
wanted
a
remand
for
further
rehearing
for
the
proceedings
before
the
commissioner
on
her
claim
for
benefits.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
don't
know
enough
about
bankruptcy
law.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
but
i
do
know
that
under--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--at
least
if
you
certify
an
issue
for
appeal
under
1292(b)...
in
other
words,
you
take
the
finality
consideration
out
of
the
picture.
all
you
have
at
question
is
whether
the
defendant
was
denied
summary
judgment
and
there's
no
question
that
the
defendant
would
be
aggrieved
even
though
that
there's
a
further
proceeding
in
which
he
may
not
be
found
liable
or,
if
it's
the
plaintiff,
on
which
the
plaintiff
may
win
on
the
merits.
and
in
this
case
we
have
a
final
judgment
that
the
court
has...
this
court
has
held
clearly
in
schaefer
that
the
court
was
prohibited
from
retaining
jurisdiction,
so
there
was
nothing
left
in
the
district
court.
it
was
final.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
claimant
would
appeal
the
second
decision
if
she
lost.
if
she
was
again
denied
benefits,
you
would
have
a
final
decision
of
the
commissioner,
the
claimant
would
have
a
right
to
judicial
review
under
the
first
and
fourth
sentences
of
section
405(g)--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
as
a--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
as
a
practical
matter
i
don't
know
that
it
would
seem
logical
to
work
like
that.
if
this
petitioner
is
denied
benefits
on
remand
it
will
be
because
the
commissioner
thought
that
there
were
other
jobs,
and
the
claimant
will
have
every
opportunity
to
raise
the
rejection
of
her
pain
testimony
and
the
rejection
of
her
treating
physicians--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
well,
in
our...
and
it
is
our
position,
although
it's
the
second
decision
that's
being
reviewed,
collateral
estoppel
would
not
be
applied
and
the
claimant
will
have
not
lost
the
opportunity
to
challenge
previous
errors
in
the
district
court--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
although
collateral
estoppel
normally
applies
when
review
is
available
and
not
sought,
it
simply
would
not
make
any
sense.
it
would
defeat
the
whole
point
of
collateral
estoppel
to
apply
it.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
courts
have
raised
preclusion
doctrines
on
their
own,
and
it
may
be
they're
concerned
about
finality.
but
what
i'm
trying
to
communicate
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
claimant
simply
goes
back
on
remand
and
loses,
the
four
issues
that
are
right
now
on
appeal
in
the
ninth
circuit
could
be
raised
again
in
the
district
court
and
the
district
court
might
reject
them
saying,
well,
i
already
considered
that
and
i'm
not
going
to
change
my
mind,
and
that's
probably
what's
going
to
happen,
but
petitioner
would
have
every
opportunity
on
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit
after
remand
to
reargue
the
merits
of
this
that
were
rejected
by
the
district
court.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right,
but
the
second
decision,
the
claimant
in
the
second
hearing
is
going
to
argue,
i'm
credible,
i
have
too
much
pain,
i
can't
work,
my
treating...
that's
all
the
evidence
she
has,
is
that
i'm
in
pain
and
my
treating
physician
thinks
i'm
in
pain
and
i
can't
work.
that's
her
evidence,
and
the
commissioner
is
going
to
reject
it
again,
most
likely.
he's
free
to
change
his
mind
in
her
favor,
but
he's
also
free
not
to
because
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
substantial
evidence.
so
the
issue
about
whether
she
has
any
evidence,
whether
there's
any
evidence
of
her
disability
and
whether
the
commissioner
met
his
burden
is
going
to
be
on...
at
issue
in
the
review
of
the
second
decision.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
i
guess
my...
our
position
is,
as
to
whether...
in
terms
of
whether
she
waits,
she's
not
going
to
get
interest
on
this
money.
the
ultimate
question
at
the
end
of
the
day
is
whether
the
commissioner
met
his
burden
of
finding
that
she
was
not
disabled,
and
she's
either
going
to
get
her
benefits
on
appeal
or
she's
going
to
get
them
back
on
remand,
but
in
terms
of
what
she
recovers--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no,
it's
a
final
judgment
in
the
sense
that
it's
immediately
appealable.
the
district
court
lost
jurisdiction
over
the
case.
i
mean,
that's
what
finkelstein
held,
that
the
court
didn't
have
the
power
to
retain
jurisdiction
and
later
in
schaefer
it
repeated
that
it
terminated
the
action
and
it
became
immediately
appealable,
and
that's
why
this
is
a
final
judgment
that
petitioner...
this
is
why
the
ninth
circuit
had
jurisdiction
and
she
was
otherwise
aggrieved.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
issue
as
to
what
happens
on...
not
this
case--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--she
waived
her
right
to
appeal
the
first
action,
but
for
purposes
of
whether
she's
entitled
to
disability
benefits
and
whether
the
commissioner
had
substantial
evidence
in
denying--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes,
because--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
legal
position
in
petitioner's
brief
is
going
to
be
the
same
whether
she
appeals
now
or
appeals
later.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
maybe
this
is
a
question
of
when...
at
what
point
she
became
disabled,
but
she
claims
her
onset
date
was
back
in
november
of
1991
and
so
for
purposes
of
whether
there
were
jobs,
i
think
that's
what
you'd
be
looking
at.
the
only
thing
that
changes
with
time
is
basically
her
age.
i
mean,
she
gets
older,
and
therefore
it's
more
likely
she
becomes
disabled
as
she
gets
older.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
as
a
practical
matter--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i'm
not
sure
how
that
would
work
out
in
practicality,
but
what
you
may
be
describing
is
a
situation
where
a
claimant
has
an
interest
in
taking
an
immediate
appeal
and
doesn't
want
to
wait.
if
the
claimant
feels
as
a
practical
matter--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
think
it
is
preserved,
but
it's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it's
final,
and
the
first
decision
is
no
longer...
maybe
it's
a
question
of
semantics.
the
commissioner's
first
decision
is
no
longer
subject
to
appeal,
and
so
what
is
on
appeal
is
the
second
decision,
but
in--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
reason
why
it's
difficult
for
me
to
answer
that
question
is,
i'm
not
sure
there
is
such
an
example
as
a
factual
matter,
where
the
evidence
wouldn't
be
present
in
the
second
hearing.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that
is
what
she's
arguing
now,
and
it's
what
she
could
argue
later,
because--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
oh,
i
see
my
time's
expired.
