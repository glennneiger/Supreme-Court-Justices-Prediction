unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
your
position
that
they
could
not
appeal
after
the
result
of
the
remand?
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
think
you're
wrong
about
that.
do
you
lose?
suppose
we
think
this
would
work
in...
just
in
the
way...
you
have
a
new
trial,
and
so
you're
not
able
to
bring
up...
let's
say
you're
the
verdict
winner.
you're
not
able
to
bring
up
the
errors
in
your
favor.
all
the
interlocutory
rulings
of
the
district
court
are
preserved
when
you
can't
appeal
them
immediately.
either...
if
you
can't
appeal
them,
isn't
that
the
ordinary
rule
in
civil
procedure?
it's
a
question
of
not
never,
but
later.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
actually
doesn't
quite
do
that.
it
says,
shall
be
final
except
that
it
shall
be
appealable
as
normal
judgments
are,
so
you
might
say,
well...
if
it
hadn't
been
for
finkelstein,
at
least,
you
might
say,
well,
it's
final
for
purposes
of
attorney's
fees.
unknown
speaker
but
with
reference
to
appeal
it's
subject
to
the
same
rule
as
any
other
judgment.
that's
a
possible
interpretation
of
the
statute.
finkelstein
runs
against
that.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
wilborn,
finkelstein
could
have
been
a
now
or
never,
as
the
court
pointed
out.
that
is,
if
the
commissioner
the
next
time
around,
in
this
proceeding
where
he's
hemmed
in,
makes
a
determination
in
the
claimant's
favor,
then
he
can't
appeal
from
his
own
order.
unknown
speaker
that
i
don't
understand,
because
if
the
court
says,
secretary,
remodify
and
remand,
that's
a
marching
order
for
the
secretary.
the
secretary
has
no
choice.
you're
suggesting
that
the
secretary
should
not
do
what
the
court
said
the
first
time
around?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
if,
being
faithful
to
what
the
court
says,
it
comes
out
that
the
claimant
wins,
then
the
secretary
is
stuck
and
can't
appeal.
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
that
you
think
you
cannot
appeal
from
an
adverse
decision
after
the
remand?
unknown
speaker
that's
by
no
means
self-evident,
at
least
to
me
from
the
statute.
why...
let
me
ask
you
the
question
this
way.
why
might
it
not
be
that
your
appeal
from
the
district
court
action
in
the
first
appeal
might
simply
in
effect
be
held
in
abeyance
till
you
go
through
your
second
civil
action
and
appeal
and
if
you're
not
satisfied
there,
at
that
point
you
can
take
everything
up.
if
you
win
on
your
first
claim,
then
we
forget
what
happens
in
the
second
civil
action.
if
you
lose
on
your
first
claim,
then
we
go
to
see
whether
there's
any
error,
the
court
of
appeals
goes
to
see
whether
there's
any
error
in
effect
based
on
what
happened
on
remand.
would
that
be
possible,
or
does
finkelstein
stand
in
the
way
of
that?
perhaps
it
does.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
think,
too.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
new
action--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
is
the
reason
that
the
old
decision
is
not
then
also
still
subject
to
review
a
timing
question,
that
the
time
for
taking
the
appeal
on
the
first
one
has
simply
run
so
that
we
can't
think
of
it
as
just
sort
of
sitting
out
there
in
abeyance?
is
that
the
reason?
unknown
speaker
okay,
but
it's
finkelstein
that
says
definitively
this
is
a
final
action.
unknown
speaker
so
basically
your
argument
comes
down...
i
think
comes
down
to
the
fact,
look,
you,
supreme
court,
decided
finkelstein.
that's
all
i'm
asking
you
to
do,
is
to
follow
through
consistently
on
it
and,
if
you
do,
i
win.
that's
basically...
is
that
right?
he
couldn't
have
put
it
better.
right?
that's
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
[laughter]
could
i
ask
you
this:
if
i
recollect
correctly
the
government
takes
the
position
in
this
case
that
although
you're
entitled
to
appeal,
you
need
not
appeal.
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
your
position.
unknown
speaker
from
what
you've
just
said,
i
gather
it's
now
or
never.
unknown
speaker
you
lose
it.
unknown
speaker
which
lets
you
appeal
now,
if
you
want,
or
later,
if
you
prefer
that?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
it's
very
logical,
if
i
understood
your
colloquy
with--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
there
are
in
fact
two
reasonably
plausible
ways
of
interpreting
this
statute,
it
seems
to
me
that,
as
the
amicus
points
out,
the
result
of
your
approach
is
going
to
produce
a
lot
of
appeals
to
courts
of
appeals
that
are
very
fact-specific
and
might
result
in
no
better
for
your
client
than
going
back
to
the
agency
and
perhaps
getting
the
relief
there
on
the
basis
of
the
remand
order.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
that...
i
understand
your
point
now.
i
didn't
get
it
earlier.
i
must
say
that
preclusion
doctrine
is
not
something
the
court
ever
interjects
on
its
own.
it's
something
that
you
can
plead
or
not
plead.
unknown
speaker
so
that
the
government
is
kind
of
saying,
we're
not
going
to
plead
it
because
we
don't
want
all
these
appeals.
unknown
speaker
why
have
you?
why...
you
said
in
your
brief...
i
took
it
from
the
brief...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understand
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
that
a
person
who
gets
a
remand
out
of
the
court
is
probably
going
to
get
his
benefits.
i
mean,
you
know,
they
have
a
lot
to
do
over
there,
so
probably...
it
would
be
an
unusual
case
that
you
go
up
to
the
circuit
not
just
to
get...
you
know,
to
get
the
remand
but
actually
force
the
circuit
to
tell
them
to
award
you
benefits.
that's
an
unusual
case.
now,
if
you
do
that
you
might
lose
the
whole
thing,
because
i
take
it
if
you
go
up
they're
going
to
say,
it
wasn't
even
right
to
remand
it.
this
is
well
within
the
discretion.
now,
i
take
it
this
is
well
within
the
agency's
discretion.
most
of
these
things
involve
bad
backs
or
pain
and
that
kind
of
stuff,
and
most
of
them
are
within
the
agency's
discretion.
so
if
you
win
your
case
here,
i
take
it
your
client
may
end
up
with
nothing.
unknown
speaker
so
why
are
you
bringing
it
then?
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
think
you'll
get
the
money
from
the
agency?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
wilborn.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
is
there
on
that
question...
just
remind
me
of
what
is
basic
civil
procedure.
imagine
there
were
no
agency
involved
in
this
case.
i
go
into
court
as
a
plaintiff
and
i
say,
judge,
i
would
like
an
injunction
and
damages,
but
by
the
way,
if
you
don't
give
me
the
injunction,
at
least
give
me
the
damages.
i'd
like
an
injunction
that
tells
him
not
to
have
that
nuisance
all
day
and
all
night,
but
if
you
don't
say
all
day
and
all
night,
at
least
make
it
all
night.
so
what
the
judge
says
is,
only
damages,
and
in
the
day,
so
i
got
some
but
not
all.
is
there
any
doubt
that
i
could
appeal
this
on
the
ground
i
didn't
get
everything
i
wanted?
unknown
speaker
no.
no
doubt
nobody
contests
that.
unknown
speaker
so
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
relationship
of
court
to
agency
makes
it
special
and
is
like
the
relationship,
court
to
bankruptcy
court,
i.e.,
so
you
didn't
have
a
final
order.
i
mean,
the
only
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
order
is
final,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
if
there
were
no
agency
in
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--and
we
had
a
virtually...
a
judgment
that
gave
one
thing
out
of
two,
it
certainly
was
appealable.
unknown
speaker
here
we
do
have
a
judgment,
one
thing
out
of
two.
however,
one
of
the
things
happened
to
be
a
word
called
remand
instead
of
damages.
unknown
speaker
you
see,
what
i'd
thought
is...
well,
i
was
thinking
bankruptcy
judges,
i
think,
and
here
i
might
be
wrong,
but
if
a
district
judge
has
an
appeal
from
the
bankruptcy
judge
and
it
has
five
parts
to
it
and
one
part
involves
a
remand
back
to
the
bankruptcy
judge,
i'm
guessing
but
i
think
that
that's
not
appealable
on
the
ground
that
it
isn't
final
in
respect
to
all
of
the
aspects
of
the
judgment.
maybe
i'm
not
right
about
that.
unknown
speaker
okay.
well--
unknown
speaker
--i
might
be
wrong.
unknown
speaker
ms.
blatt,
you
think,
though,
that
an
appeal
could
also
be
taken
if
the
claimant
waits
until
the
end
of
remand?
unknown
speaker
and
you
think
that...
suppose
she
chooses
not
to
appeal
now,
let's
it
go
back
on
remand,
litigates
it,
and
then
is
not
fully
satisfied
that
she
can
appeal
without
having
lost
anything,
as
the
claimant
says
she
might
do.
unknown
speaker
that's...
that
couldn't
possibly
be
right.
that's
the...
when
she
goes
back...
if
i
understand
this.
i
may
not,
but
i
thought
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor
might
have...
what
was
said
so
far
is,
it's
now
remanded.
unknown
speaker
she
now
has
a
new
proceeding.
at
the
end
of
the
new
proceeding
she
gets
nothing.
she
now
appeals
on
two
grounds.
the
first
ground
is,
of
course,
in
the
second
when
i
should
have
gotten
something.
unknown
speaker
the
first
ground
is,
even
if
they're
right
about
the
second
proceeding,
i
deserved
to
win
the
first
time.
i
deserved
to
win
the
first
time,
and
that
claim
i
think
is
the
claim
that's
lost,
just
as
you
cannot
appeal
a
denial
of
a
summary
judgment
when
you
have
had
a
final
judgment
against
you
on
the
merits.
you
can't
appeal
on
the
ground
i
should
have
won
the
summary
judgment
even
if
i
lost
the
trial.
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
his
complaint.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
he
will...
he
wants
to
say
one
thing.
judge,
even
if
the
fall
of
1998
there
are
adequate
jobs,
there
were
not
adequate
jobs,
and
that
was
clear
in
1996,
or
1995,
whenever
that
first
proceeding
took
place.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
claim
he's
worried
about
losing.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
finkelstein
is
going
to
be
followed,
and
it
is
final,
then
why
wouldn't
collateral
estoppel
attach,
and
why
would
anyone
be
able
to
say,
look,
i
should
have
won
the
first
time
around,
if,
following
the
entry
of
a
final
judgment
in
that
proceeding,
one
then
goes
in...
through
a
new
series
of
litigation,
what
is
a
new
case
by
definition?
unknown
speaker
ms.
blatt,
wouldn't
there
be
some
doctrine
other
than
collateral
estoppel?
i
brought
up
before,
and
i
think
that
mr.
wilborn
agreed
with
me,
collateral
estoppel,
res
judicata,
claim
preclusion,
issue
preclusion,
these
are
not
things
that
a
court
brings
up
on
its
own.
these
are
affirmative
defenses
that
you
can
raise
or
not,
so
if
we're
simply
talking
about
preclusion
doctrine,
it's
in
the
government's
control.
the
question
i
think
justice
breyer
meant
to
raise
was
not
issue
preclusion
or
claim
preclusion,
but
is
there
something
in
the
finality
doctrine,
once
you
give
it
this
final
label,
that
gets
the
court
into
the
act,
something
that
the
court
would
raise
on
its
own,
where
a
court
would
not
raise
preclusion
doctrine
on
its
own?
unknown
speaker
but
what
wouldn't...
i
think
the
way
the
court
would
get
into
it,
willy
nilly,
the
government,
is
that
i
certainly
would
be
disposed
to
say
the
issue
that
you're
raising
pertains
to
a
prior
decision
of
the
secretary.
what
you're
seeking
to
review
this
time
is
a
totally
different
decision.
the
prior
decision
was
set
aside.
there's
been
a
new
proceeding
below.
it
is
this
new
proceeding
that
i'm
reviewing
now,
and
the
point
you're
trying
to
raise
pertained
to
an
old
decision
that's
gone.
i'm
not
sure
that's
a--
--that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
not
claim
preclusion
or
issue
preclusion.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
there's...
she
wants
to
raise
a
different
issue.
she
wants
to
say,
regardless
of
what
happened
in
the
second
proceeding,
at
the
end
of
the
first
proceeding
i
was
entitled
as
a
matter
of
law
to
prevail
because
there
was
this
one
issue,
as
litigated
in
the
first
proceeding,
upon
which
i
was
entitled
to
win.
the
court
i
suppose
at
that
point
is
going
to
say,
no,
you
can't
do
that,
because
finkelstein
says
the
first
proceeding
was
final
and
you
did
not
appeal
it.
now,
that
can
be
raised
by
the
court,
and
why
wouldn't
the
court
say
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
let
me
ask
the
question
another
way.
if,
in
fact,
following
the
second
proceeding,
she
may
then
litigate
what
she
believes...
if
she
chooses
to
go
through
the
second
proceeding
without
appealing,
if
she
may
then
litigate
what
she
believes
is
the
error
in
the
first
proceeding,
what's
left
of
finkelstein?
it
doesn't
look
very
final
to
me.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it's
final,
she
can
appeal,
she
doesn't
appeal,
why
doesn't
she
waive
her
appeal?
unknown
speaker
oh,
well
then,
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
at
the
end
of
the
second
proceeding
she
could
still
appeal
what
she
thought
was
the
error
in
the
first
proceeding,
and
the
point
upon
which
she
didn't
prevail.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
may
not
be,
because
there
may...
justice
breyer's
example.
there
may
be
evidence
in
the
second
proceeding
of
job
opportunities
that
were
not
there,
the
evidence
that
was
not
there
in
the
first
proceeding.
she
still
wants
to
say,
regardless
of
what
happened
in
the
second
proceeding,
on
the
record
in
the
first
proceeding
i
was
entitled
to
prevail
and
you're
saying,
yes,
she
can
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
you're
saying
is
that
necessarily
in
the
second
appeal
everything
that
was
subsumed
in
the
first
appeal
is
going
to
be
presented.
unknown
speaker
no
harm,
no
foul.
let's
assume
that
that's
not
right.
let's
assume
that
there
was
a
theory
presented
in
case
number
1,
and
the
district
court
said,
you
cannot
proceed
on
this
theory,
and
she
then
proceeds
on
a
second
theory.
if
she
does
not
appeal
the
first
judgment,
may
she
still
in
the
second
proceeding
complain
about
the
error
of
the
district
court
on
the
first
go-around?
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking,
suppose
she
does
wait.
can
she
still...
does
she
still
preserve
the
issue
that
was
resolved
against
her
in
the
district
court
on
round
1?
unknown
speaker
but
why,
if
it's
final,
other
than
just
the
government
is
not
going
to
raise
it?
i
was
going
to
say
it's
the
law
of
the
case,
but
then
you'd
say,
well,
it's
a
different
case,
so--
unknown
speaker
--so
that
she
can
lose
the
right
to
raise
the
specific
theory,
to
advance
this
theory,
because
she's
not
appealed
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
take
this
case.
she...
there
was
an
expert
that
the...
was
not
credited,
and
there
was
some
of
her
testimony
that
wasn't
credited,
and
she
wants
at
the
end
of
the
line
to
say,
i
didn't
get
as
much
as
i
should
have,
or
i
didn't
get
anything,
but
if
they
had
only
believed
me,
if
they
had
only
accepted
my
first
expert.
that's
a
case
that
you
can...
it's
a
concrete
case,
so--
unknown
speaker
--the
question
is,
if
she
did
not
take
this
first
appeal,
she
goes
back,
she
does
what
they
allow
her
to
do,
still
her
expert
doesn't
come
in
and
they
still
disbelieve
her.
then
can
she
raise
those
alleged
errors
the
second
time
around,
although
she
didn't
take
a
first
appeal?
unknown
speaker
yes.
you've
answered
the
question,
i
think.
mr.
snyder.
unknown
speaker
how
is
it
any
different
than
the
run-of-the-mill
case
where
a
person
goes
into
court
and
he
says,
i
want
damages
and
an
injunction?
you
know,
my
example
that
i
gave.
i
want
a
big
injunction.
if
you
don't
give
me
that,
give
me
a
little
injunction.
if
you
don't
give
me
the
little
injunction,
give
me
damages.
i
want
all
three.
give
me
one,
two,
or
three.
i'd
like
the
most
possible.
he
gets
one,
he
doesn't
get
two
or
three,
he
can
appeal.
unknown
speaker
right.
that's
what
i
thought,
too,
but
now
we
have
a
holding
that
this
remand
business,
when
you
remand
to
an
agency,
unlike
maybe
some
other
remands,
it
does
count
as
a
final
decision
of
the
district
court
for
purposes
of
an
appeal,
and
once
you
have
that
holding
which,
i
take
it,
is
a
holding
of
this
court,
isn't
that...
though
your
brief
is
very
good,
and
you're
an
amicus,
and
i
appreciate
your
work,
but
isn't
that
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
snyder,
why
couldn't
in
the
same
manner
mean
in
the
same
mode,
like,
i
have
30
days
to
file
a
notice
of
appeal,
or
60
days,
or
whatever
it
is?
why
doesn't
manner
just
refer
to
the
procedural
thing?
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
suppose
we
had
a
finkelstein-type
appeal,
so
the
government,
after
the
remand
order
the
government
wants
to
appeal,
we
know
it
can.
the
government's
position
is,
we
were
right.
this
person's
not
entitled
to
any
benefits,
period.
no
remand.
the
government
could
appeal,
right?
unknown
speaker
could
she
cross-appeal,
then?
unknown
speaker
not
a
very
efficient
way
to
run
a
show,
is
it?
i
mean,
if
it's
up
there
for
one
purpose,
you
might
as
well
hear
everything.
unknown
speaker
well,
this
isn't
just
limited
to
social
security
cases.
i
was
surprised
that
your
brief,
or
for
that
matter
the
government's
brief
didn't
cite
a
lot
of
cases
involving
other
agencies.
i
mean,
we've
had
judicial
review
of
administrative
action
for
a
long
time
with
respect
to
hundreds
of
agencies
and,
in
fact,
those
proceedings
often
result
in
a
remand
to
the
agency
which
does
not
give
the
claimant
as
much
of
a
correction
of
the
agency's
action
as
the
claimant
would
like.
do
you
have--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
expect
a
whole
bunch
of
cases
involving
this
issue.
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
think
that--
--and
anyway,
most
of
them
go
to
the
court
of
appeals.
do
you
think
that
in
an
ordinary
case
involving...
well,
whether
it's
district
court
or
court
of
appeals,
when
they
finally
get
done
with
that,
do
you
think
that's
not
a
final
judgment?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
cases
to
that
effect?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
that
they're
not
aggrieved,
and
i'm
puzzled,
like
justice
scalia
is.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
hear
cases
from,
say,
the
d.c.
circuit
all
the
time
where
they've
remanded
but
the
legal
theory
is
contested.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
i
misunderstood
you.
i
thought
in
your
argument
here
today
you
were
saying
that
they
were
not
aggrieved.
unknown
speaker
but
sticking
with
the
aggrieved,
isn't
she
aggrieved
because
the
wrong
legal
theory
was
adopted,
just
as
in
the
routine
case
where
we
take
cert,
say,
from
the
d.c.
circuit
after
it
remands
to
an
agency
and
it
comes
up
here
first?
unknown
speaker
how
about
if
the
person
just
wins
partially
and
it's
remanded?
that
would
be
more
equivalent
to
this.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
she
can
still
get
what
she
sought?
she
can
still
get
what
she
sought
from
the
social
security
administration.
she
cannot
get
what
she
sought
from
the
district
court.
what
she
sought
from
the
district
court
was
a
reversal
of
the
agency...
assume
the
district
court
was
not
about...
she
can
come
to
the
district
court
and
say,
give
me
money.
that's
not
what
she
sought.
she
sought
from
the
district
court
a
reversal
of
certain
action
taken
by
the
social
security
administration,
various
actions.
they
gave
her
a
reversal
of
some
of
the
actions.
they
did
not
give
her
a
reversal
of
the
other
actions.
she
can
never
get
that
reversal
again,
unless
she
gets
it
now.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
with
the
government
on
that?
unknown
speaker
she
would
lose
in
the
district
court.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
mean
she
couldn't
raise
it
in
the
ninth
circuit,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
oh,
but
i
mean,
my
goodness,
if
you're
talking
about
mucking...
i
mean,
i
wouldn't
think
there
would
be
a
deluge
of
litigation
if
we,
you
know,
adopted
the
government's
theory,
because
most
people
will
be
satisfied
with
the
remand
and
won't
want
to
risk
losing
it.
but
if
we
adopted
the
theory
you've
just
espoused
that
says,
when
there
have
been
several
agency
proceedings
and
now
finally
we
reach
a
final
determination,
and
then
it
comes
up
to
the
court
of
appeals
eventually,
the
litigant
can
not
only
complain
of
all
the
errors
in
the
most
recent
one,
but
can
go
back
to
the
errors
that
normally
wash
out...
the
summary
judgment
ones,
the
earlier
proceeding
ones,
the...
et
cetera,
that
i
think
might
be
problematic.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
the
decision...
that
still
affect
the
decision
in
the
second
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
not
issues
that
independent...
that
are
independent
of
the
second
case.
those
are
gone.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
do
you
know
how
this
works
out?
i
thought...
i
was
trying
to
think
of
an
analogy
that
i'm
not
positive
of
the
answer
to.
suppose
a
company
a
sues
company
b
for
a
breach
of
contract,
and
company
a's
claim
in
the
district
court
is,
i
want
$100,000
for
the
breach,
but
in
the
alternative
this
is
the
kind
of
breach
that
falls
within
an
arbitration
clause,
so
in
the
alternative,
if
i
don't
get
the
$100,000,
send
me
to
arbitration.
so
what
the
district
court
does
is,
he
sends
the
person
to
arbitration.
can
company
a
appeal
it
on
the
ground
that
he
wants...
the
money?
he'll
take
the
arbitration
as
his
second
chance,
and
it's
no
answer
to
him
to
say
the
arbitration
may
work
out
in
your
favor,
because
he's
thinking
it
may
not
work
out
in
my
favor.
i
mean,
maybe
it
will,
maybe
it
won't.
so
how...
i
don't
know
if
you...
i
purposely
picked
an
example
i'm
not
positive
of
the
answer
to.
unknown
speaker
so
in
my
case,
if
i
go
look
up
authority,
which
i
haven't
looked
up,
and
then
i
find
that
in
my
arbitration
case
the
person
can
appeal...
he
says,
a,
i
want
$100,000,
but
if
not,
send
me
to
arbitration.
they
send
him
to
arbitration.
if
i
find
out
he
can
appeal
that,
the
$100,000...
you
guess
he
can't.
i
guess
he
can't.
if
it
turns
out
he
can,
then
that
really
is
a
good
analogy,
and
then
you'd
lose
this
one,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
but
is
my
analogy
good
or
not?
i
wonder.
i
mean,
i'm
not...
i'm...
get
a
reaction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
is
it
your
position
that
she
could
not
appeal...
even
if
the
government
appealed,
she
could
not
file
a
cross-appeal?
that
was
his
answer.
that's
the
logic
of
your
position,
and
it
is.
unknown
speaker
mr.
snyder,
one
of
the
questions
that
justice
scalia
asked,
mustn't
this
come
up
over
and
over
again
with
review
of
agency
decisions,
but
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute,
and
i'm
not
aware
that
the...
it
seems
to
me
that
405(g)(4)
and
(8)
are
unusual.
usually,
when
there's
a
remand
you
don't
get
a
district
court
disassociating
itself
from
the
case.
it
keeps
the
case,
so
if
it
comes
back
again,
it
comes
back
again.
but
this
peculiarity
of
405(g),
what,
(4)
and
(8),
says,
district
court,
you're
done.
you
remand,
you're
done.
if
it
ever
comes
back
again,
it's
a
new
judge,
a...
that's
what
makes
this
final
and
that's
why,
i
guess,
congress
used
the
word
final.
are
there
other
statutes,
judicial
review
statutes
like
405(g)(4)
and
(8)?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
it
be
appealed
by
the
government?
i
mean,
if
it's
not
final,
i
assume
it
can't
be
appealed
by
either
the
winning
party
or
the
losing
party.
it's
certain
that
if
it's
going
to
be
remanded
to
the
agency
and
the
agency
thinks
it
shouldn't
have
been
remanded
at
all,
the
agency
can
appeal.
unknown
speaker
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
the
agency
appeal
if
it's
not
a
final
judgment?
unknown
speaker
this
isn't
a
weird
little
exception.
the
government
appeals
all
the
time--
unknown
speaker
--when
it's
remanded,
and
you're
telling
me
it's
appealing
all
of
these
nonfinal
judgments
in
the
ordinary
cases?
i
doubt
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly
in
cases
like
california
v.
stewart,
where
the
evidence
is
thrown
out
in
a
criminal
case,
we
have
allowed
not
only
the
federal
government
but
the
state
governments
to
appeal,
because
if...
they
might
never
have
the
opportunity
to
challenge
that
ruling
again.
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
it
depends
upon,
the
odds?
unknown
speaker
i'll
give
you
an
opportunity
to
win
a
million
dollars.
buy
a
mass
lottery
ticket.
i
mean,
that's
not
a
great
opportunity.
so
now
do
we
look...
you
know,
she
didn't
get
the
money,
which
is
what
she
wants.
how
do
we
use
this
word...
how
would
we
use--
unknown
speaker
--well,
will
she
get
it?
unknown
speaker
she'd
love
to
have
that
assurance.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
quite--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
not
completely
true,
is
it?
is
it
not
possible
that
on
the
present
record
she
might
prevail
on
appeal,
but
that
on
remand,
additional
evidence
which
comes
into
the
record
would
make
it
less
clear
that
she
would
prevail?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
evidence
would
go
against
her
as
well
as
for
her
after
a
remand,
when
there's
more
evidence
in
the
record.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
could
be
more...
less
favorable
to
her,
that's
all
i'm
saying.
it
could
be.
unknown
speaker
she
might
have
just
exactly
what
she
wants
in
the
record
now,
and
she
thinks
as
a
matter
of
law
she's
entitled
to
prevail
now,
but
when
more
evidence
goes
in
it
might
not
be
quite
as
clear.
which
is
what
is
going
on
here,
if
i
understood
counsel's
presentation
correctly.
unknown
speaker
that's
a
good
point,
so
why
wouldn't
we
make
that
same
point
to
the
government?
i
mean,
your
basic
argument.
why
wouldn't
we
have
said
to
the
government,
government,
look...
you
know,
in
a
case
when
they
opposed
the
remand...
government,
what
are
you
complaining
about?
after
all,
the
case
was
remanded.
you
have
an
opportunity
to
win.
and
if,
in
fact,
you
lose,
well,
you
can
make
all
your
arguments
later.
unknown
speaker
now,
do
i...
what
you
said
just
before
this,
do
i
understand
it
to
be
your
position
that
in
these
cases...
you
know,
i
mean,
she's
only
gotten
half
of
what
she
wanted,
but
the
government
has
only
gotten
half
of
what
it
wanted,
and
the
government
may
win
when
it
goes
back,
just
as
she
may
win
when
it
goes
back.
do
you
assert
that
the
only
reason
the
government
can
appeal
in
these
cases
is
if
and
when
the
government
would
have
no
other
opportunity
to
raise
the
question?
we
have
to
look
into
that
in
every
case?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
so,
which
is...
makes
it
sort
of
inconsistent
with
your
theory.
i
mean,
given
finkelstein
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
even
though
the
government
might
get
what
it
wanted
when
it
went
back
down,
it
could
appeal,
period.
unknown
speaker
why
should
the
rule
be
any
different
for
the
other
side?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
either
finkelstein
decided
the
question
i
asked
you,
or
it
didn't
decide
the
question
i
asked
you.
you
told
me
that
finkelstein
decided
that
the
government
can
always
appeal,
despite
the
fact
that
it
may
get
what
it...
that
it
may
not
be
aggrieved,
that
it
may
get
what
it
wants
on
remand.
you
said
finkelstein
decided
that.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
go
on
to
say,
finkelstein
only
decided
finality.
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
it
didn't
address
appellate
standing.
so
you
then
take
the
position
that
in
some
cases
the
government
won't
be
able
to
appeal
either,
unless
you
can
show
that
the
government
cannot
otherwise
raise
the
point
it
wants
to
raise.
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
to
be
your
position.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
know
it
isn't,
because
it's
not
a
very
attractive
one.
[laughter]
but
it
follows
from
your
argument,
i
think.
well,
the
secretary
never
appeals
to
the
district
court,
does
he?
i
mean,
he
doesn't--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
only
people
who
appeal
to
the
district
court
are
the
claimants.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
when
the
government
loses,
the
government
can
still
go...
i
assume
that
when
the
government
loses
in
the
district
court,
it
can
always
go
up,
and
i
don't
think
you
have
to
look
to
see,
could
the
point
be
raised
elsewhere.
we
just
say
it
can
go
up,
even
though
the
government,
if
it
were
remanded,
may
come
up
on
top...
come
out
on
top
anyway.
unknown
speaker
but
once
the
decision
has
been
held
final
for
purposes
of
the
government's
dissatisfaction,
what
other
issues
might
come
into
a
question
of
whether
the
government
has
appellate
standing
that
have
not
already
been
subsumed
in
whether
the
decision
is
final
for
purposes
of
the
government's
ultimate
right
to
appeal
it?
i
mean,
you're
saying
there
was
a
decision
about
finality,
so
that
at
some
point
the
government
could
appeal
it,
but
i
mean,
we're...
i
assume,
for
example,
we're
not
talking
about
attorney's
fees
here,
so
what
else
might
the
government
have
to
show
to
provide
appellate
standing
that
it
had
not
also
shown
in
order
to
get
the
determination
that
it
was
final
as
to
the
government?
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
come
back
to
the
point
that
finkelstein
is
terribly,
terribly
subtle
if
it
was
reserving
the
point
of
aggrievement.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
rather
misleading
case,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
claimants'
attorneys
appreciate
that,
too?
what
was
the
figure
in
the
brief,
something
like
60
percent
of
them...
if
there's
a
remand,
60
percent
of
them
end
up
getting
benefits?
unknown
speaker
so
wouldn't...
whether
there
is
that
second
opportunity
or
not,
wouldn't
many
attorneys
say,
look,
save
the
money?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
snyder.
unknown
speaker
you
appeared
here
as
an
amicus
by
appointment
to
the
court,
and
the
court
wishes
to
express
its
appreciation
to
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wilborn,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
unknown
speaker
because
it's
what,
five
levels
now,
three
inside
the
agency
and
two
in
the
courts?
unknown
speaker
possibly
six.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
