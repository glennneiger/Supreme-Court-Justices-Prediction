mr.
wilborn,
you're
an
expert
in
this
area,
and
i'm
just...
in
listening
to
this
hour's
argument
i'm
wondering,
why
wasn't
the
social
security
benefit
arrangement
ever
changed
to
conform
to
the
railroad
retirement
by
simply
cutting
out
the
district
courts?
then
you
have
only
one
level
of
appeal,
and
you
don't
have
this
question.
was
that
ever
proposed?
