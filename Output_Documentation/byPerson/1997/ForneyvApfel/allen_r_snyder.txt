mr.
allen
r.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
here
won
a
judgment
in
the
district
court
that
remanded
the
case
back
to
the
agency,
where
she
has
the
opportunity
to
obtain
all
of
the
relief
that
she
originally
sought.
we
believe
that
under
those
circumstances,
where
the
district
court
granted
her,
in
fact,
the
relief
that
was
one
of
the
alternative
prayers
for
relief
in
her
complaint,
that
under
those
circumstances
she
is
not
aggrieved
by
the
district
court
judgment.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
the
key
difference,
justice
breyer,
we
believe
is
that
in
the
normal
case
that
you
posit
there
has
been
a
final
decision
from
which
there
is
no
further
proceedings,
other
than
in
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
we
do
not
believe
it
is
the
end,
justice
breyer,
because
while
the
judgment
is
arguably
final,
and
we
can
talk
about
the
meaning
of
finkelstein
further,
that
accepting
finkelstein
as
requiring
that
this
be
viewed
as
a
final
judgment,
that
does
not,
we
believe,
resolve
the
question
of
whether
under
this
statute,
which
opposes
an
additional
limit
on
appealability...
the
statute
says
that
the
judgments
under
405(g)
are
final,
except
that
they
shall
be
subject
to
review
in
the
same
manner
as
other
judgments
in
other
civil
actions,
and
those
standards
that
are
applicable
to
other
civil
actions
include,
we
submit,
the
appellate
standing
doctrine
for
which
we've
cited--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well,
we
certainly
agree
that
it
includes
the
examples
that
you
gave,
justice
ginsburg,
but
it
doesn't
seem
by
its
language
to
limit
it
to
particular
procedural
requirements.
it
says
it's
subject
to
review
in
the
same
manner
as
other
judgments,
and
we
think
that
the
roper
case
that
was
cited
from
this
court
and
numerous
other
cases
have
made
clear
that
the
appellate
standing
doctrine
is
one
of
the
doctrines
that
is
looked
at
in
all
cases
to
be
sure
that
an
appellant
in
fact
is
aggrieved,
and
that
someone
should
not
be
appealing
a
decision,
whether
it's
a
final
decision
or
a
nonfinal
decision,
unless
they
are
aggrieved.
and
here,
what
is
perhaps
unique
about
this
case
is
that
under
this
statutory
scheme
you
have
a
judgment
that
is
labeled
final,
but
in
this
situation,
which
is
a
very
common
situation
under
this
statute...
we
understand
from
the
government
that
there
are
literally
thousands
of
remands
like
this
per
year.
in
this
situation,
while
it
is
labeled
a
final
judgment,
it
is
nevertheless
a
matter
that
will
proceed
on
a
remand
where,
unlike
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
where
the
claimant
has
the
opportunity
to
obtain
every
bit
of
the
relief
they
seek.
they
can't
obtain
it
today.
they
can
only
obtain
it
after
the
remand.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
not
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
where
we
think
she
lacks
standing,
and
we
think
that
that's
not
such
an
anomalous
result
as
suggested
by
the
solicitor
general's
brief,
because,
for
example,
in
cases
dealing
with
remands
to
agencies
in
a
typical
apa-type
case,
that
is
normally
not
a
final,
reviewable
decision.
but
there
is
a
line
of
cases
such
as
occidental
petroleum
v.
sec,
and
some
other
cases
we've
cited,
that
provide
an
exception
where
the
government
can
appeal
the
remand
if
the
matter
is
otherwise
not
susceptible
to
review
by
the
government,
and
that
is
actually
the
finkelstein
holding
in
an
analogous
situation.
so
a
so-called
one-way
right
of
appeal,
where
only
the
government
can
appeal
today,
but
the
claimant
has
to
wait
and
appeal
after
the
remand,
is
a
rule
that
is
in
place
today
with
regard
to
administrative
agency
cases
generally.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
i
think
that
the
alternative,
which
is
suggested
by
both
the
petitioner
and
the
respondent,
is
extremely
inefficient
in
the
sense
that
there
are
4,000-and-some
remand
decisions
every
year
from
this
agency.
we
know
that
as
a
statistical
matter,
60
to
65
percent
of
those
cases
results
ultimately
in
a
decision
after
the
remand
in
favor
of
the
claimant.
to
allow
the
claimants
to
appeal
and
clog
the
federal
courts
with
potentially
thousands
of
additional
appeals
when
the
claimants
can
get
the
same
relief
faster,
we
submit,
by
simply
going
through
the
remand
process--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--the
main
difference--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well,
i
don't
believe
that
a
decision
here
is
likely
to
affect
the
broad
array
of
such
cases,
justice
scalia.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
because
in
the
administrative
procedure
act
in
the
normal
situation
of
a
review
of
an
agency
decision
i
don't
believe
that
you
have
the
finality
ruling
that
you
have
in
this
case.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
absent...
in
most
cases
i
think
it's
not
if
they
remand,
justice
scalia.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
the
occidental
petroleum
case
i
mentioned
cites
scores
of
cases
that
say
that
in
a
typical
review
of
an
agency
action
the
claimant,
or
the
person
challenging
the
agency
action
cannot
appeal
when
there's
been
a
remand,
but
there's
an
exception
sometimes
for
the
government.
in
other
words--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
they're
not
aggrieved.
we
didn't
cite
those
cases
for
that
proposition
at
all.
i'm
simply
saying
that
with
regard
to
the
applicability
of
this
decision
to
typical
agency
review
cases
i
think
it
is
not
likely
to
be
broadly
applicable
to
those
because,
for
separate
reasons,
those
cases
are
not
necessarily
viewed
as
final
decisions
if
they're--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
am...
our
principal
argument
in
today's
case,
with
regard
to
this
claimant,
is
that
she's
not
aggrieved.
we
are
not
arguing
today
that
there's
not
a
final
decision,
because
under
405(g)
and
under
finkelstein,
at
least
arguably,
and
the
ninth
circuit
held,
that
this
is
a
final
decision.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
typically
the
court...
this
court
does
not,
i
believe,
typically
take
review
from
a
circuit
court
if
there's
been
a
remand
decision
except
where
the
government
seeks
review
because
it
otherwise
would
not
be
able
to
obtain
review
of
the
issue.
in
other
words,
if
a
claimant
wins
in
a
court
of
appeals
and
wins
a
remand
for
a
new
agency
action,
i
do
not
believe
this
court
has...
i'm
not
aware
this
court
has
ever
accepted
a
cert
petition
from
a
winning
petitioner,
someone
who
challenged
an
agency
action
and
won.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
if
the
remand
offered
them
the
opportunity,
on
remand,
to
win
all
of
the
relief
that
they
were
seeking,
then
i
would
argue
that
review
would
be
inappropriate.
but
to
come
back
to
the
issue
in
this
case,
we
know
that
here,
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
this
is
a
final
decision,
so
you
do
not
have
the
typical
issue
that
you
have
on
most
apa
cases.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
i
don't
agree
with
the
latter
part
of
that,
justice
scalia,
for
this
reason.
what
i
think
the
claimant
really
wants
is
her
social
security
disability
benefits,
whether
they're
ordered
by
the
agency
or
ordered
by
the
district
court,
or
ordered
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
disagree
respectfully
with
the
petitioner's
suggestion
that
she
is
unable
later
to
appeal
a
subsequent
decision
on
remand.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
we
agree
partly
with
the
government.
we
definitely
agree
she's
able
to
file
an
appeal,
and
any
issues
that
she
lost
in
the
first
goaround
which
become
pertinent
in
the
second
proceeding,
preclusion
principles
the
ninth
circuit
held,
we
think
correctly,
preclusion
principles
would
not
prevent
her
from
raising
those
on
the
second
appeal,
given
our
position
that
she
doesn't
have
the
right
to
appeal
now.
however,
the
government
takes
the
view
that
she
does
have
the
right
to
appeal
now
and
typical
preclusion
principles
we
think
require
that
if
someone
forgoes
an
available
appeal,
then
they
are
precluded.
so
our
position
is
that
applying
straightforward
preclusion
principles
and
applying
the
appellate
standing
doctrine
to
this
case,
as
the
ninth
circuit
did,
results
in
a
very
simple
conclusion
and
that
is,
she
is
not
able
to
appeal
now
because
she's
not
aggrieved,
but
she
has
a
remand
opportunity
at
which,
number
1,
she
can
win
everything
she
wants
on
remand
or,
if
she
doesn't,
number
2,
she
can
appeal
then
the
agency
decision.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
that's
our
position
that
she...
correct.
she
could
raise
it
in
the
ninth
circuit.
if
the
district
court
said
we're
going
to
maintain
our
same
position
after
the
second
case
as
we
did
on
the
first,
there
is
nothing
in
preclusion
principles
that
would
prevent
the
ninth
circuit
in
the
second
remand
case
from
then
reviewing--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--no,
i
actually
meant
to
say,
justice
breyer,
and
perhaps
i
misspoke,
that
after
the
second
decision
from
the
agency,
that
any
issues
from
the
first
case
that
still
affect
the
decision
would
be
subject
to
review,
because
they
would
then
be--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
that's...
justice
souter,
that's--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--if
the
decision...
yes.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
if
the
decision
on
the
remand
didn't
deal
at
all
with
some
issue
that
was
dealt
with
earlier,
then
in
reviewing
the
second
case
there
would
be
no
issue
to
review.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
our
position
is
that
if
a
party
asks
a
judge
for
a
form
of
relief
as
an
alternative,
and
indicating
by
asking
it
that
this
is
something
that
the
party
is
seeking,
that
it
would
be
inviting
the
trial
judge
to
make
a
supposed
error
if
you
allowed
the
party
to
turn
around
and
appeal
when
the
district
judge
did
exactly
what
the
party
asked
him
to
do.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
our...
we've
actually
made
a
couple
of
alternative
arguments.
one
of
our
alternative
arguments--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well,
i
think
it's
a
good
analogy
on
the
issue
of
whether
the
fact
that
you
asked
for
a
certain
type
of
relief
precludes
you
from
then
appealing
when
the
court
grants
you
the
relief
you
asked
for.
i
think
it's
a
good
analogy
on
that.
i
don't
believe
it's
applicable
to
our
alternative
argument,
and
really
our
first
argument,
which
is
that
she's
not
aggrieved
for
the
primary
reason
that
she
still
can
obtain
all
the
relief
she's
ever
sought.
the
social
security
benefits--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
think
it
is
the
logic
of
the
position.
i
agree
it's
not
an
ideal
solution
once
a
case
is
before
the
court.
on
the
other
hand,
unless
the
court
adopts
some
notion
of
pendant
appellate
jurisdiction,
there
either
is...
there
either
is
an
opportunity
for
the
claimant
to
appeal
or
there
isn't.
then
we
believe
it's--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--justice
ginsburg,
we
agree
it's
an
unusual
statute
and
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
when
i
referred
to
the
differences
between
it
and
the
typical
agency
decision.
we
have
tried
to
find
comparable
statutes,
and
found
some
that
are
somewhat
analogous,
but
i
can't
say
that
we
found
any
that
are
precisely
the
same.
25
u.s.c.
section
1276
governs
review
of
decisions
of
the
surface
mining...
under
the
surface
mining
control
and
reclamation
act
and
it
allows
review
by
parties
aggrieved
by
such
a
decision.
it
allows
for
modification
of
the
decision.
it
doesn't
specifically
say
that
the
remand
is
a
final
judgment,
although
it
could
be
argued
that
that's
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
there
are
many
statutes
that
allow
review
by
a
court
of
appeals
of
particular
agency
decisions
and
that
have
provision--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--that's
right.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
the
government
or
the
agency
appeals--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well,
there
have
been
some
cases,
as
i
referred
to
earlier,
where
the
government
appeals
from
what
is
admittedly
not
a
final
judgment
but
because
there
may
not
be
an
opportunity
for
the
government
ever
to
appeal
the
particular
ruling
that
the
lower
court
has
made.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
this
case--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well,
we
certainly
are
not
suggesting
that
the
government
routinely
appeals
these
cases.
i
simply
was
trying
to
indicate
there
is
an
exception
to
the
finality
principle
under
which
in
some
cases
the
government
has
been
allowed...
as
in
finkelstein,
in
the
occidental
petroleum-type
example,
in
a
typical
apa
review,
sometimes
the
government
does
appeal
a
nonfinal
decision.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
and
the...
mr.
chief
justice,
the
key
distinction,
we
think,
between
that
case
and
all
these
other
cases
and
the
kind
of
situation
we
have
here
is
that
in
this
case
we
believe,
under
the
appellate
standing
doctrine...
not
finality
issues,
but
appellate
standing,
the
claimant
is
not
aggrieved
because
at
this
point
she
has
received
not
only
the
alternative
relief
she
asked
for
in
her
complaint
as
a
matter
of
pleading,
but
she
also
has
received
an
opportunity
to
get
every
dollar
of
benefits
she
wants.
unlike
hypotheticals
where
someone
gets
damages
and
not
an
injunction,
or
vice
versa,
and
there's
no
further
opportunity
for
them
to
get
the
remainder
of
the
relief,
she
may
well...
the
odds
are
she
will
get
every
penny
she's
asked
for.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
no,
i--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--she
hasn't
gotten
it
yet,
justice
breyer,
and
i
agree--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--well--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--the
courts
will
know
whether
she
gets
it,
we'll
all
know
whether
she
gets
it
after
the
remand,
and
if
she
gets
it,
there
never
will
need
to
be
an
appeal.
there...
to
take
an
appeal
today
is
a
waste
of
time
of
the
already
overburdened
federal
appellate
courts
to
have
an
appellate
process
on
a
hypothetical
issue
where
she
may--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
can't
quantify
it.
she
may
get
her
full
relief
without
the
appeal.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
if
the
subsequent
decision
were
based
on
legal
rulings
from
this
earlier
case
we
think
they
could
be
reviewed
later,
but
if...
i
understand,
justice
stevens,
your
question
to
be,
if
there's
simply
a
new
record--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--and
the
facts
are
different
in
the
new
case,
then
i
agree
that
the
courts
would
review
the
new
record
based
on
the
record
as
it
then
stands,
and
that's
not
uncommon.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
don't
really
think
it
is
what's
going
on
here,
justice
scalia.
if
you
review
the
appellate
briefs
of
petitioner
in
the
court
below,
as
well
as
looking
carefully
at
what
she
alleges
are
the
errors
as
she's
filed
her
papers
here,
she
is
arguing
basically
legal
errors
by
the
district
court.
she's
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
law
there
were
mistakes
in
the
phrasing
of
hypothetical
questions,
in
the
credibility
determinations...
she's
not
simply
saying,
lack
of
substantial
evidence.
she's
raised
legal
issues.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
in
a
case...
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
v.
jose
that
we
cited,
the
court
allowed
the
government
to
appeal
that
nonfinal
decision
because
there
were
particular
provisions
in
the
court's
decree
that
were
binding
on
the
government
in
the
meantime.
it
wasn't
simply
a
question
of,
the
matter
can
be
resolved
later.
so
i
think
there
are
some
situations
where
the
government
never
could
get
review
of
the
issue
that
it
seeks
to
raise
because
the
remand
proceedings
will
wash
out
the
legal
issue.
that
is
not
this
case,
we
submit,
and
i
also
would
point
out
on
the
issue
of
cross-appeals
that
typically
a...
an
appellant
can
defend
the
judgment
on
any
grounds
that
would
allow
for
support
of
the
judgment,
so
even
if
technically
on
the
appeal
of
the
second
decision,
even
if
the
claimant
can't
file
a
cross-appeal,
they
in
most
cases
could
defend
the
judgment
on
other
grounds
and
therefore
have
their
opportunity
to
raise
their
issues.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
no,
justice
scalia,
because
this
court's
decision
in
finkelstein
held
to
the
contrary.
this
court
held
that
the
government
can
appeal
these
cases
and
it
didn't
require
a
showing
of--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--particularized
need.
it
simply
held--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--finkelstein--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--finkelstein
only
decided
the
issue
of
finality,
justice
scalia,
with
reference
to
this
statute.
it
did
not
address
appellate
standing.
so
we
are
prepared
to
assume,
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
as
did
the
ninth
circuit,
that
this
is
a
final
decision.
one
could
debate
the
meaning
of
finkelstein.
it
actually
could
be
interpreted
differently,
but--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--yes,
sir.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i...
let
me
try
to
be
clearer,
justice
scalia.
finkelstein
decided,
based
on
finality
principles,
that
the
government
can
appeal
because
it's
a
final
decision.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
finkelstein
simply
did
not
address
appellate
standing.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
we--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--it's
not
a
position
we've
taken
up
to
this
moment,
justice
scalia.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
no.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
that's
correct.
the
secretary
apparently
does
not
have
the
right
to
appeal
his
or
her
own
decision
to
the
district
court,
but
i
take
justice
scalia's
position
to
be--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
agree
that
the
issue
of
appellate
standing
has
never,
to
my
knowledge,
been
raised
with
regard
to
a
government
appeal
to
a
circuit
court
in
this--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--if
someone
were
arguing
that
the
government
was
not
aggrieved
by
the
decision,
then
obviously,
if
the
government
could
show
that
there
was
an
issue
of
law
that
couldn't
otherwise
be
reviewed,
they
would
most
clearly
be
aggrieved.
but
i
take
your
point,
justice
souter,
that
one
could
argue
that
in
any
case
the
government
ultimately
might
win
on
the
remand,
and
i
think
that's
an
issue
that
the
courts
simply
haven't
addressed.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
don't
believe
it
was
reserving--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--justice
souter,
i
don't...
i'm
not
asserting
that
it
reserved
that
issue.
it
simply
hadn't
been
raised,
wasn't
addressed,
wasn't
considered,
i
would
submit,
and
obviously
one
could
read
finkelstein
as
opening
up
the
doors
and
saying
that
both
sides
can
appeal
every
one
of
these
cases.
we
simply
submit
that
would
result
in
hundreds
and
perhaps
thousands
of
needless
appeals
where,
at
least
as
to
the
claimant...
i'm
not
sure
as
to
the
government,
but
at
least
as
to
the
claimant
we
know
that
she
has
the
opportunity
to
get
complete
relief
on
remand.
it
is
actually
less
expensive--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--yes,
ma'am,
between
60
and
65
percent.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i'm
sure
many
would.
on
the
other
hand,
many
would
like
two
bites
at
an
apple
and
take
the
view
that,
let's
try
the
appeal
and
we'll
get
the
remand
later.
it's
hard
to
predict.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
thank
you.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
thank
you.
