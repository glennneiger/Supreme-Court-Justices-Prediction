mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
our
position
is
that
epcra
authorizes
a
citizen's
suit
for
failure
to
file
timely
reports
when
the
reports
are
filed
only
after
notice
of
an
intended
citizen's
suit.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
they
could
not
recover
civil
penalties
for
sure,
against
the
administrator.
the
question
would
be
whether
there
was
a
sufficient
likelihood
of
recurrence
to
give
them
article
iii
standing.
that
would
be
the
issue--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--in
that
sort
of
case,
so--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i...
first
of
all,
i
read
the
complaint
a
little
differently
to
be
ambiguous
on
that
point
at
(5)
of
the
joint
appendix.
it
says,
the
right
to
know
about
such
releases
and
its
interest
in
protecting
and
improving
the
environment
and
the
health
of
its
members
have
been,
are
being,
and
will
be
adversely
affected
by
the
defendant's
action
in
failing
to
provide
timely
and
required
information.
it
doesn't
speak
backwards,
it
doesn't
speak
forwards.
it
speaks
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
statute
there,
and--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
that's
one
way
of
reading
it,
but
they
also
seek
an
injunction
that
looks
towards
future
compliance,
it
seems
to
me,
that
might
sort
out
that
ambiguity
a
little.
and
beyond
that,
justice
souter,
even
if
this
particular...
to
answer
your
complaint
about
the,
shouldn't
we
interpret
this
more
narrowly
in
light
of
the
constitutional
question,
even
if
this
particular
complaint
doesn't
allege
what
is
sufficient
for
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
occurrence,
that
wouldn't
mean
that
some
plaintiffs
couldn't,
and
therefore
this
statute
ought
not
to
be
interpreted
more
narrowly
than
it
is,
because
certainly
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
let
me
just
define
the
class
of
plaintiffs
who
have
a
cause
of
action
here
and
then
say
why
we
think
that
there's
no
article
iii
problem.
the
class
of
plaintiffs
who
have
standing
are
only
those
class
of
plaintiffs
where
the
defendants
files
the
report
only
after
receiving
notice
of
an
intended
citizen's
suit.
that
is
what
this
statute
authorized.
we
derive
that
not
just
from
the
plain
language
of
the
citizen's
suit
provision,
which
says
that
you
can
sue
for
failure
to
file
untimely
reports,
but
by
a
contrast
between
the
notice--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--right,
and
the
most
natural
reading
of
under
in
that
context
is
that
it
incorporates
the
requirements
from
the
reporting
provisions
so
that
they
did
not
have
to
be
repeated
all
over
again
in
the
citizen's
suit
provision,
and
one
of
those
requirements
is
that
there
has
to
be
timely
reports,
so
a
failure
to
submit
and
complete
reports
under
those
reporting
provisions
encompasses
a
suit
for
the
filing
untimely
reports
just
as
it
encompasses
a
suit
for
inaccurate
information
in
those
reports.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
that's
why
the
article
iii
question
turns
on
the
reasonable
likely...
the
article
iii
standing
question
is
whether
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
of
recurrence
in
that
situation,
and
we
submit
that
the
voluntary
cessation--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--okay.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
there
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there
is
a...
no.
it
has
to
be
alleged
that
there
is
a
sufficient
likelihood
of
recurrence.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
there...
the
presumption
would
come
that
in
this
scenario
where
somebody
files
a
report
only
after
being
given
notice
that
he's
going
to
be
sued,
there
should
be
a
presumption
that
there
is
a
sufficient
likelihood
of
recurrence
to
give
the
plaintiff
article
iii
standing--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
if
this
court's
voluntary
cessation
cases
do
say
that
when
someone
comes
into
compliance
only
after
the
commencement
of
litigation
there
is
a--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
realize
that,
but
i
want
to
start
with
the
principle
that
the
court
has
established--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no,
it's
an
article
iii
doctrine
that
the
court?
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
they
are
parallel
in
an
article
iii
sense,
justice
breyer.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that
there
would
be
a
prudential
standing
barrier
at
that
point,
because
the
court
has
not
carried
on
on
its
own
the
same
rules
at
the
standing
stage,
the
same
presumptions
at
the
standing
stage
that
it
has
employed
at
the
mootness
stage,
but
as
an
article
iii
matter,
any
time
somebody
comes
into
compliance
only
because
someone
has
either
told
them,
i'm
going
to
sue
you
or
somebody
has
filed
a
lawsuit,
there's
a
presumption.
now,
that
presumption,
i
hasten
to
add,
can
be
rebutted.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
voluntary
cessation
cases
that
we're
relying
on
include
united
states
v.
w.
t.
grant,
city
of
mesquite
v.
aladdin's
castle,
and
a
whole
series
of
cases.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
huge
leap
as
an
article
iii
matter,
because
as
an
article
iii
matter,
the
plaintiff
at
that
stage
of
the
litigation
has
to
have
a
sufficient
interest
for
article
iii
purposes
to
carry
on
the
litigation.
if
the...
if
it...
let's
say
things
had
been
remedied
1
day
after
this
litigation
commenced,
1
day
after,
you
would
apply
the
voluntary
cessation
cases
and
you
would
say
there
is
a
presumption
that
there
is
a
sufficient
likelihood
of
recurrence
to
keep
this
case
alive,
and
that
could
be
rebutted
only
if
the
defendant
has
a
heavy
burden.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
we
have
a
situation,
though,
where
the
person
has
cured
that
original
violation,
and
the
plaintiff
at
that
point
has
the
burden
of
showing
that
he
has
a
continuing
interest
in
the
litigation.
the
only
way
he
gets
there
is
through
a
presumption.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
that
there's
no
problem
with
carrying
over
the
idea
that
there
has
to
be
an
allegation,
but
i
think
that
the
important
point
is
that
there
has
to
be
a
presumption
with
that
allegation--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it's
not
an
empirical
likelihood,
but
a
sufficient
likelihood
in
the
scenario
where
the
person
only
comes
into
compliance
after
the
commencement
of
litigation.
if
somebody
is
coming
into
compliance--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
that's
what
the
company
asserts,
justice
kennedy,
and
that
would
be
something
that
would--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
this
is
no
longer
at
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--there's
no
longer...
we're
far
distant
from
the
time
in
which
this
statute
was
enacted
at
this
point.
if
the
court
has--
