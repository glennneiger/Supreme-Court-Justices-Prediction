so
on
your
view,
then,
if
the
compliance
came
after
the
60-day
period,
let's
say
the
time
sequence
is
60-day
period
runs,
suit
is
filed
on
day
70,
the
defendant
comes
into
total
compliance,
files
all
the
back
forms,
the
suit
would
be
moot
at
that
point,
if
i
follow
your
reasoning.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
if
there
were
mootness,
after
the
60-day
period
ran
as
a
result
of
compliance
there
would
still
be
entitlement
to
attorney's
fees,
would
there
not,
because
the
mootness
didn't
come
about
until
after
the
case
was
in
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why...
no,
i
mean,
there
was
for
8
years
no
filing,
and
then
it
was
called
to
their
attention.
by
the
way,
when
there
was
a
filing,
was
it
for
all
the
past
years
or
only
the
most
recent
year?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
strauss,
the
violation
here,
the
only
requirement
is
that
you
file
a
form,
so
then
it's
logical
to
talk
about
failure
to
file
or
submit
a
form.
in
the
other
statutes,
perhaps
more
encompassing,
there
would
be
a
reason
to
use
language,
alleged
to
be
in
violation,
because
there
were
many
things
that
could
violate
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
it
more
than
that?
wasn't
it
simply
that
they
didn't...
that
they
violated
it
on
one
occasion,
but
wasn't
there
something
built
into
that
amending
language
that
suggests
that
the
person
was
a
repeat
violator?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
fine.
you
could
allege
that
they
didn't
do
this
on
this
one
occasion.
you
say
that's
all
that
this
statute
required.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
question
was,
are
you
asserting
a
continuing
violation,
or
any
reason
to
project
that
there
might
be
one,
and
i
think
the...
your
answer
candidly
is,
the
statute
didn't
require
it
and
we
didn't
plead
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
strauss,
in
attorney's
fees
provisions,
i
mean,
there
are
many
in
many
statutes,
and
i
had
thought
that
the
congress
tried
more
or
less
to
be
careful
about
when
it
is
talking
about
litigation
fees,
that
is,
fees
generated
post
complaint,
and
fees
that
happen
because
of
investigation,
fees
at
the
agency
level,
and
when
congress
speaks
of
litigation
fees,
that
generally
has
meant
while
you're
in
court,
and
when
it
talks
about
fees
before
the
agency
or
investigation,
that's
for
that
earlier
period.
but
here,
the
term
is
litigation
fees.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why,
any
more
than
if
the
police
engaged
in
a
certain
kind
of
tactic
and
were
told
that
that's
not
good
to
do,
that
they're
not
going
to
do
it
any
more?
there
are
many
cases
where
it's
easy
to
allege
continuing
violation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
is
a
commencement
of
litigation.
