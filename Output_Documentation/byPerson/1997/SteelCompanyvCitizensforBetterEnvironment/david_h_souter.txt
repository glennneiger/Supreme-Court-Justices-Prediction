would
the
penalty
ever
go
to
anyone
other
than
the
government?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
stein,
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
one
of
the
arguments
that
is
being
made
here
is
that
if
standing
is
not
found,
with
the
opportunity
to
go
forward
with
penalties
and,
of
course,
get
counsel
fees
and
investigatory
fees
and
so
on
as
a
result
of
that,
no
one
is
going
to
have
really
an
incentive...
no
citizen
is
going
to
have
an
incentive
ever
to
commence
one
of
these
proceedings.
my
question...
with
that
in
mind
my
question
is
this:
is
there
any
requirement
that
when
a
citizens
organization
starts
the
60-day
period
running
it
must
then
have
concluded
that
it
can
prove
a
case,
or
could
a
citizens
group
simply
come
forward
and
say,
we
don't
know
of
any
reason
why
this
particular
company
should
not
have
been
filing
these
reports.
it
looks
to
us
as
thought
they're
covered
by
the
law.
so
we're
going
to
put
them
on
notice
that
we
think
they
should
comply
and
simply
wait
and
see
what
happens.
in
that
latter
instance
if,
at
the
end
of
60
days,
there
hadn't
been
any
compliance,
then
at
that
point
the
citizens
organization
could
decide
whether
to
go
ahead
and
in
effect
make
an
investment
in
legal
fees
and
investigatory
fees
to
see
whether
it
would
really
be
worthwhile
to
bring
action.
so
that's
why
i
ask
the
question.
can
they
simply
put
them
on
notice,
as
it
were,
on
the
basis
of
a
good
faith
claim
that
they
ought
to
be
filing,
or
is
there
some
requirement
in
the
statute
or
regulations
to
the
effect
that
they
must
in
effect
be
ready
to
establish
probable
cause,
or
some
such
thing,
for
a
violation
before
they
even
give
the
notice
that
starts
the
60
days
running?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
nobody
has
to
make
a
big
investment
to
get
the
60
days
running?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
that's
so,
maybe
these
organizations
could
just
send
out
standard
notices
to
everybody.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
is
your
answer
to
mr.
stein's
point
in
responding
to
one
of
my
questions
that
you
didn't
have
to
dig
at
all?
if
you
had
any
reasonable
suspicion
that
they
should
have
filed
a
report,
all
you
had
to
do
was
put
them
on
the
spot
and
say,
we
claim
you
should
have,
the
60
days
are
running,
and
if
at
the
end
of
the
60
days
they
had
not
filed
a
report,
then
you
could
have...
you
would
have
had
a
basis
for
saying...
or
you
could
have
made
a
decision
at
that
point
as
to
whether
to
invest
something
further
into
this
investigation,
but
you
didn't
have
to
do
the
digging,
according
to
him,
that
you
claim
you
did.
is
he
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
necessary
to
redress
something,
not
necessary,
as
it
were,
in
a
circular
fashion,
merely
to
be
in
a
position
to
claim
attorney's
fees--
justice
david
h.
souter
--or
investigatory
fees,
so
your
claim
is
still
tied
to
an
obligation
to
come
up
with
some
injury
that
can
be
redressed
by
the
suit,
and
number
1
there
is
no
claim
here
that
there's
any
further
redress
that
you
can
get
for
the
past
failures.
everything
that
can
be
known
is
now
known.
there
is
no
allegation,
as
i
read
it,
that
in
fact
there
is
a
likelihood
of
violation
in
the
future.
number
3,
if
you
make
your
claim
for
the
penalties,
you
don't
get
one
red
cent
of
that
penalty
money,
as
i
understand
it,
so
that
the
only
thing
that
you
can
obtain
that
you
do
not
now
have
is
the
attorney's
fees
or
the
investigatory
fees,
and
they
are
tied,
it
seems
to
me,
to
litigation
which
has
got
to
give
you
some
other
benefit.
in
other
words,
they
alone
cannot
under
the
statute
justify
it.
so
i
guess
my
problem
is,
if
i
construe
the
statute
the
way
you
want
me
to
construe
it,
it
seems
to
me
there
is
a
very
serious
article
iii
question,
and
it
makes
sense
to
construe
the
statute
in
a
way
which
will
not
raise
this
article
iii
question.
what's
wrong
with
that
argument?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you're
not
saying,
are
you,
that
the
statute
gives
you
a
statutory
right
to
that
independent
of
the
section
that
refers
to
litigation
costs?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i'm
not
suggesting
the...
or,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
by
my
question
that
the
statute
should
be
interpreted
so
narrowly
as
to
preclude
standing
if
there
were
an
allegation
of
either
a
continuing
violation
or
the
probability
of
a
future
violation,
but
i'm
concerned
about
the
interpretive
question
when
there
is
no
question
of
continuing
violation
in
the
sense
that
they
file
everything
that
can
be
filed
with
respect
to
the
past,
there
is
no
allegation,
and
we'll
leave
the
question
of
ambiguity
aside
for
the
moment,
of
the
likelihood
of
a
future
violation,
there
is
no
penalty
that
can
be
recovered
that
will
go
into
the
pocket
of
the
private
plaintiff,
and
the
only
thing
which
is
in
issue
is
the
issue
of
attorney's
fees
or
investigatory
fees
for
the
time
prior
to
the
moment
when
litigation
could
be
begun.
that's
the
scenario
in
which
it
seems
to
me
there
is
an
article
iii,
a
serious
article
iii
question,
and
it's
on
that
scenario
that
i
would
suggest
it
might
be
wise
to
interpret
the
statute
narrowly
to
avoid
having
to
reach
that
issue.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
may,
but
do
you
agree
that
there
is
nothing
further
that
can
be
done
to
redress
the
prior
failure?
