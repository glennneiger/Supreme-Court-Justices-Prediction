justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
a
question,
please,
if
i
may,
mr.
stein.
what
if
it
were
the
epa
that
were
coming
in
asking
for
penalties
to
be
imposed
after
the
fact
of
a
cure,
so
to
speak,
after
the
forms
were
actually
filed,
but
the
epa
then
comes
in
and
says,
well,
they
should
have
been
filed
on
x
date
and
they
weren't,
and
they've
now
filed
them,
but
we
want
a
penalty
for
every
day
of
the
nonfiling.
under
the
statutory
scheme,
is
that
permissible?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
citizen's
suit
provision
i
suppose
is
designed
to
be
a
sort
of
private
attorneys
general
approach,
and
to
let
citizens
pick
up
the
slack
if
the
epa
doesn't
do
it,
and
is
there
any
reason
why
the
citizens
suit
shouldn't
have
the
same
authority,
then,
to
come
in
and
seek
a
penalty
for
the
failure
to
file
on
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
is
before
the
60-day
period
that
the
company
files
the
reports,
but
the
plaintiff
believes
and
is
prepared
to
show
that
the
company
is
likely
to
be
a
repeat
offender?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
it
had
been
completed
and
filed,
the
forms?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
that's
possible,
and
you
don't
tie
that
to
any
language
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
have
to
read
it
that
way.
i
mean,
it
does
possibly
suggest
to
you
that
if
the
form
is
completed
and
filed,
it
meets
the
requirement
regardless
of
when.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
little...
it's
open
to
that
interpretation,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
because
312
is
the
statute
that
says
the
forms
will
be
filed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
60-day
notice
provision
has
to
be
factored
in,
too.
it
must
have
been
there
for
a
purpose.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
a
simple
matter?
as
your
opposing
counsel
said,
it's
on
the
internet
whether
or
not
they
filed
the
report.
if
the
report
had
been
filed,
there
it
would
be.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
find
out
they
didn't
file
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
don't
need
much
of
that.
you
know
what
the
companies
in
the
business--
--is
that--
--are
doing.
the
gist
of
the
action
is
failure
to
file
the
report,
not
trying
to
show
the
report
is
untrue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
not
in
that
language.
it
doesn't
say
that.
failure
to
complete
and
submit
reports
under
section
so-and-so.
