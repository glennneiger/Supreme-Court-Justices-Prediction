justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
statute
says
under
(f)
that
the
court
may
award
costs
of
litigation.
that's
what
the
statute
says,
so
i
guess
they
are
entitled
to
investigatory
costs
only
if
those
are
part
of
the
costs
of
litigation.
is
that
right?
i
mean,
what
we're...
i
mean,
what
i
would
interpret
the
question
to
be
is,
is
there
something
special
here
by
way
of
costs
that
are
being
awarded
in
this
case
that
are
not
normally
present
whenever
a
statute
provides
a
winning
party
with
costs
of
litigation?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
you
to
go
back
for
a
minute
to
this
costs,
getting
your
cost.
what
is
your
response
to
the
following
fairly
simple
argument
that
has
to
do
with
whether
their
injury
is
redressable,
which
i
take
it
is
the
standing
question?
you'd
say,
well,
how
did
this
hurt
you,
their
violation?
answer:
you
are
an
environmental
group.
the
violation
hurt
you
in
that
you
were
forced
to
live
in
a
world
without
information,
or
you
had
to
spend
some
money
to
cure
the
lack
of
information,
and
the
spending
of
money
involved
putting
the
company
on
notice,
and
then
they
cured
it.
and
so
what
we
do
in
this
statute
is,
we
don't
allow
you
in
respect
to
past
violations...
we
don't
completely
help
you
out,
but
we
help
you
a
little.
either
they
will
be
stopped
in
their
tracks
by
the
court
because
they
didn't
comply,
or
if
they
did
comply,
we
will
give
you
back
some
of
the
money
you
spent
getting
them
to
comply,
and
therefore
we
are
redressing
your
harm,
not
all
of
it,
but
some
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
have
to
worry
about
a
different
question.
i
take
it
one
of
the
questions
that
i'd
have
to
answer
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
standing,
and
the
reason
you
argue
there
is
not
is
because
their
injury
is
not
redressable
insofar
as
they
were
injured,
it
was
redressed.
this
lawsuit
doesn't
redress
it.
hence
my
question.
is
the
lawsuit
aimed
at
redressing
a
different
part
of
their
injury,
namely,
the
cost
of
investigating
the
matter
and
bringing
it
to
the
attention
of
the
company,
and
the
lawsuit
gives
them
some
of
that
money
back.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
the
statute
does
not
give
them
back
their
cost
except
insofar
as
they
are
related
to
this
litigation,
which
took
place
as
part
of
the
litigation
decision,
not
as
the
other
decision?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
how
do
i
look
that
up?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
have
three
statutes
that
use
the
word,
occur.
one
is
cercla,
one
is
rcra,
and
one
is
tosca,
and
they
all
use
in
the
venue
provision
the
word
occurred,
and
then
in
the
liability
provision...
they're
rather
parallel
to
this
one,
aren't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right,
and
so
they're
parallel
to
this
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
violation
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
say
about
mr.
stein's
answer
to
my
question.
he
had
a
pretty
good
answer,
i
thought,
that
he
said
that
the...
as
far
as
the
harm
goes
in
respect
to
your
not
having
the
report
filed,
well,
that
was
cured,
so
this
suit
doesn't
aim
to
get
you
that,
and
as
far
as
the
costs
go,
in
paragraph
(e)
of
your
complaint
what
you
actually
ask
for
is
to
award
the
plaintiff
all
of
its
investigation
and
prosecution
costs
and
others
as
authorized
by
section
326(f),
and
then
he
says,
if
i
read
section
326(f)
i'll
see
that
it
authorizes
litigation
costs,
pure
and
simple,
and
so
it
can't
help
you
redressing
that
kind
of
harm
without
opening
the
door
to
article
iii
being
no
limitation
on
the
lawsuits.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
another
reason
it
relates
is
because,
if
you
say
that
giving
a
person
litigation
costs
is
sufficient
to
create
an
article
iii
case,
then
there
is
virtually...
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--expanded...
it's
un...
you
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
the
problem.
but
if
you
read
it
the
other
way,
it
seems
to
make
a
certain
amount
of
sense.
those
instances
where
the
company
might
not
comply
in
the
future,
you
allege
that,
ask
for
an
injunction,
and
there
you
have
no
standing
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
those
cases
where
there's
no
significant
risk
of
that
at
all,
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
of
course,
then,
there
wasn't
really
a
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
if
it's
that,
then
how
do
you
run
across
the
problem
here
that
they
haven't
alleged
anything
about
recurrence?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
sounds
as
if
what
it's
saying
is
their
failure
to
file
in
the
past
will
continue
to
hurt
them
in
the
future.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
mootness,
and
in
a
case
called
mootness...
there
was
a
case
under
the
constitution.
there's
no
argument.
do
you
think
those
should
be
parallel?
if
they're
parallel,
i
don't
know
what
that's
going
to
do
to
standing
law.
i
haven't
really
thought
that
through.
it
never
occurred
to
me
that
those
two
things
were
parallel.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
any
case
in
which
the
possibility
of
recurrence
prevents
mootness,
in
any
such
case,
a
plaintiff
would
have
standing
despite
the
absence
of
any...
of
any
ongoing
violation.
that's
a
pretty
broad--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
but
let's
allege
it
at
least.
i
mean,
look,
this
seems
like
the
simplest
approach
is
also
the
best
approach.
the
simplest
approach
would
say,
in
those
instances
where
there's
some
likelihood
of
recurrence,
the
lawsuit's
serving
an
excellent
purpose.
the
lawsuit
is.
and
in
those
cases
where
there
is
no
likelihood
whatsoever,
the
only
purpose
it's
suing
is
perhaps
through
the
litigation
cost
thing
to
give
them
some
of
their
money
back.
well,
that
would
be
the
simple
approach,
and
why
not
follow
that
simple
approach?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
language
certainly
is
open,
and
if
it's
open,
why
wouldn't
it
make
a
lot
of
sense
to
say,
in
the
instance
where
there's
some
reason
to
think
they'll
do
it
again,
they
did
it
before,
maybe
they'll
do
it
again.
or
they
didn't
do
it
before,
maybe
they
won't
do
it
again.
in
such
a
case,
it
authorizes
the
suit.
