we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-643,
steel
company,
also
known
as
chicago
steel
and
pickling
company,
v.
citizens
for
a
better
environment.
mr.
stein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
gwaltney,
though,
the
case
turned
on
fairly
specific
language
in
that
act,
the
present
tense
of
to
be
in
violation,
and
the
seventh
circuit
said
they
thought
the
language
of
this
act
was
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
stein.
mr.
strauss,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
you
would
have
benefited
had
they
filed
their
report,
because
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
dig
out
the
information
yourself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
you--
--you
dug
it
out
for
some
independent
purpose,
not
just
to
try
to
show
that
their
report
might
be
false?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
need
to
dig
it
out
in
order
to
determine
whether
they
failed
to
file
a
report?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
strauss.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gornstein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
article
iii.
that's
entitlement
to
an
injunction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what's
the
presumption--
--what's
the
argument
for
the
presumption?
--based
on?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
stein,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
isn't
it
equally
reasonable
to
think
that
it
refers
to
in
compliance
with
the
provisions
of,
rather
than
just
the
statute
by
name?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
we
need
that
case
to
tell
us
that.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
