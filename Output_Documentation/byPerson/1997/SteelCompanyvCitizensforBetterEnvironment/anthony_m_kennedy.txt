justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
about
the
attorneys
fees
and
costs
that
the
claimant
might
have
incurred
in
investigating
the
claim
and
filing
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
they
can
recover
those
costs
if
the
violation
is
not
cured
after
60
days
and
the
suit
proceeds
and
they
prevail,
can
they--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
but
then
it
seems
to
me
there
may
be
a...
you
have
a
statutory
argument.
i
don't
see
the
article
iii
argument.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
what
is
the
proposition...
what
is
a
case
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that
was
just
whether
or
not
there
was
an
interest
in
being
a
prevailing
party
per
se.
i'm
not
sure
if
it
said
that
congress
couldn't
create
a
cause
of
action
for
attorneys
fees
or
investigatory,
preparatory
fees
legitimately
and
in
good
faith
incurred.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
then
it's
not
an
article
iii
question.
it's
just
a
statutory
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you're
putting
in
this
phrase,
retain
jurisdiction,
and
i...
maybe
justice
scalia
thought
you
answered
his
question.
i
still...
i'm
still
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
let's
assume
that
after
the
60
days
has
run,
the
suit
is
filed,
then
it's
cured,
then
it
comes
before
the
judge,
the
judge
says
there's
nothing
more
to
do,
i'm
going
to
give
no...
i'm
going
to
terminate
my
jurisdiction
now,
there's
no
necessity
for
me
to
issue
some
ongoing
injunction,
but
i
am
going
to
award
attorney's
fees.
can
he
do
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
from
the
standpoint
of
mootness
and
article
iii,
the
precise
analysis
would
apply
if
the
violation
were
cured
before
the
60
days.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
also
take
the
position
in
the
case
of
suits
against
the
administrator?
if
the
administrator
is
given
60
days'
notice,
and
then
before
the
60
days
expires
begins
to
take
the
corrective
action,
can
the
plaintiffs
still
sue
and
recover
attorney's
fees?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what's
the
presumption
based
on?
is
it
based
on
our
judicial
notice
that
there's
an
empirical
likelihood
that
when
you
violate
something
once,
you'll
violate
it
again?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
is
that
a
likelihood
here,
when
one
of
the
problems
is,
is
that
this
company
just
didn't
have
notice
of
the
statute?
it
just
didn't
know
about
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
isn't
this
going
to
be
a
likelihood
in
a
significant
number
of
these
early
cases?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
know
what
your
presumption
is
based
on.
