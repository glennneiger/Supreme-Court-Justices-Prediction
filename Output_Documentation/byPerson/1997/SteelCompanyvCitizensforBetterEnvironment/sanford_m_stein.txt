mr.
sanford
m.
stein
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
60-day
notice
period
in
the
citizens
provision
of
the
emergency
planning
and
community
right
to
know
act,
and
whether
that
period
is
intended
to
operate
as
a
cure,
thereby
obviating
a
citizen's
suit,
or
whether
citizens
may
sue
for
wholly
past
violations
even
after
cure.
as
found
by
this
court
in
gwaltney
v.
chesapeake
bay
foundation,
and
again
in
hallstrom
v.
tillamook
county,
the
overriding
congressional
purpose
of
environmental
citizen
provisions
is
to
prompt
compliance
with
environmental
laws.
litigation
ought
to
be
used
as
a
last
resort,
when
other
methods
have
failed.
on
receiving
a
60-day
notice
under
epcra,
the
steel
company,
a
small
manufacturing
company,
came
into
complete
compliance,
filing
the
15
forms
required,
all
within
the
cure
period.
the
respondent,
citizens
for
a
better
environment,
sued
anyway.
they
alleged
no
current
or
ongoing
violations.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
yes,
justice
o'connor,
under
our
reading
of
the
statute
the
epa's
enforcement
policy
comes
under
section
325
of
the
statute,
a
wholly
different
section
than
section
326,
the
citizen
provision.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
yes.
several
reasons,
as
we
see
it.
first
of
all,
section
326
is
far
more
limited,
giving
citizens
a
more
limited
enforcement
and
assistance
role
than
the
epa's
authority
under
section
325.
in
the
citizen
provision,
a
citizen
may
commence
a
suit
upon
the
failure
to
complete
or
submit
the
forms.
the
sixth
circuit,
in
analyzing
the
same
language
in
the
united
musical
case,
found
that
it
was
the
failure
that
congress
was
looking
for.
epa's
authority
is
far
broader
than
that.
also,
section
326(c)
of
the
statute
specifically
points
out
that
citizens
are
able
to
invoke
the
court's
jurisdiction
in
the
evidence
of
an
enforcement
or
an
injunctive
remedy,
and
then
at
that
time
the
court
can
apply
penalties
if
it
has
jurisdiction
through
326,
section
326(c).
in
that
respect,
the
citizen
provision
of
epcra
is
very
similar
to
the
citizen
provision
of
the
clean
water
act
that
this
court
analyzed
in
gwaltney.
in
gwaltney,
the
court
found
many
reasons
to
find
that
congress
did
not
expect...
intend
citizens
to
sue
for
wholly
past
violations,
but
one
of
the
most
convincing
was
section
505(a)
of
the
clean
water
act.
there,
also,
the
court
found
that
before
a
citizen
could
invoke
the
court's
jurisdiction
it
had...
there
had
to
be
some
kind
of
injunctive
or
abatement
remedy
that
it
was
seeking
and
then,
and
only
then,
would
the
court
be
willing
to
address
penalties
relative
to
a
citizens'
action.
beyond
that,
and
further
answering,
we
think
that
if...
even
if
the
court
below
were
somehow
correct
that
they
can
seek
wholly
past
violations,
we
think
it
fails
the
article
iii
standing
test
because
on
that
date
any
injury
that
would
befall
a
citizen
had
been
fully
cured.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
justice
kennedy,
the
costs
that
they
incur
investigating
are
also
costs
that
they
cannot
recover
if
the
epa
comes
in
under
the...
under
epcra.
they
are
barred
from
suing
if
epa
comes
in
under
the--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--if
they
prevail,
then
they
can
assert
a
likelihood
for
fees--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--i
think
the
court
has
ruled
that
penalties
alone
have
to...
do
not
give
a
party
standing.
they
have
to
be...
a
standing
has
to
accrue
as
an
underlying
part
of
the
plaintiff's
claim
and
just
investigation
costs
and
fees
are
a
byproduct
of
the
litigation.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
diamond
v.
charles.
also,
lewis
v.
continental
bank.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
i
think
there
was
language.
i
don't
know
if
it
said
the
congress
could
not,
but
here
i
don't
think
congress
did.
i
mean,
it
was...
well,
there's
some
addressed--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--we
believe
the
statutory
question
here
is
far
more
important
than...
and...
than
the
court
could
rule
completely
under
the
statute,
because
under
the
plain
language
of
that...
it
is
the
completion
and
submission
of
the
forms,
the
failure
of
that
action,
that
gives
rise
to
a
citizen
action,
and
that's
what
united
musical
found,
that's
what
the
district
court
found.
the--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--justice
ginsburg,
at
that
point,
mootness
principles
would
apply
and
the
burden
would
shift
to
the
defendant
to
show
why
mootness
would
apply
and
why
there
would
be
no
likelihood
of
a
recurring
violation
such
as
to
relieve
the
court
of
its
jurisdiction.
but
whereas
mootness
will
lie
after
the
complaint
is
filed,
if
it
is
filed
with
article
iii
authority
for
standing,
mootness
standing
is
the
plaintiff's
burden.
it
must
be
proven
at
the...
prior
to
the
complaint
being
filed,
and
we
don't
believe
that
they
had
standing
in
this
case
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
not
necess--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--well,
first
of
all,
i
think
they
may
file
for
any
number
of
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
congress
was
interested
in
compliance,
and
interested
in
citizen
enforcement.
if
the
suit,
which
we
think
is
properly
filed
after
the
60
days,
because
that's
the
limit
of
the
cure
period...
the
burden
on
the
defendant
at
that
point
is
a
heavy
one
to
show
that
there's
no
further
likelihood
of
an
intermittent
or
recurring
violation,
and
there
may
be
cases
where
it
is
mooted,
and
there
may
be
cases
where
it
is
not,
but
i
believe
congress--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--if
you're
filed
before
the
suit
was...
before
the
suit
was
filed,
but
after
the
60
days,
i
believe
standing
would
not
lie.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
at
that
point
the
court
would
have
jurisdiction,
justice
scalia,
and
the
court
could
apply
and
determine--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--not
necessarily.
no,
i
did
not
say
it
was...
i
don't
mean
to
convey
that
it's
mooted.
i
do...
i
think
that
the
burden
severely
shifts
to
the
defendant
at
that
point,
and
the
defendant
has
a
heavy
burden
under--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--after...
after
filing,
if
the
party
did
not
cure
within
60
days--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--and
they
did
file
after
suit
began.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
and
the
court
determines
that
there
is
reason
for
the
court
to
retain
jurisdiction,
it
is
not
moot
in
the
court's
estimation
because
there
is
a
possibility
of
further
violations,
or
that
the
allegedly
illegal
conduct
may
continue.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
the
court
at
that
time,
after
a
suit
is
properly
filed,
would
be
able
to
assess
whether
its
jurisdiction...
whether
the
granting
of
penalties
at
that
point
would
have
some
continuing
effect,
or
some
beneficial
effect
as
to
the
defendant,
but
if
it
is
mooted
the
court
would
lose
jurisdiction,
i
would
agree,
and
therefore
the
penalties
would
not
apply.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
not
at
all,
justice
souter.
under
section
325,
the
government
is
the
only
party
entitled
to
receive
the
penalties.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
if
the
court
were
to
retain
jurisdiction
after
properly
receiving
it,
then
i
assume
the
court
could
then
address
the
question
of
anything
within
its
jurisdiction,
including
whether
or
not
the
prevailing
party
was
the
plaintiff,
the
citizen
organization
in
that
case,
and
whether
or
not
it
should
receive
fees.
we
do
not
have
a
problem
with
those
issues
after
proper
filing,
meaning
that
there
is
a
violation
that
is
ongoing
on
the
date
that
the
complaint
is
filed.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
i
believe,
justice
kennedy,
he
might
be
able
to
determine
in
that
case
that
because
the
plaintiff
brought
the
suit,
and
because
it
was
cured
after
suit,
and
presumably
the
judge
could
at
that
point
say
that
it
was
the
action
of
suit
that
brought
the
defendant
into
compliance,
he
might
be
able
to
find
that
the
plaintiff
citizen
organization
at
that
time
was
the
prevailing
party
or
substantially
prevailing
party,
as
the
statute
reads,
and
award
fees.
i
think
that
would
be
a--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--if...
i
disagree,
because
before
the
60
days...
congress
gave
a
60-day
period
to
cure,
and
congress
gave
citizens
the
right
to
sue
in
the
event...
going
back
to
the
statute,
in
the
event
cured...
in
the
event
there
was
a
failure
to
comply.
that
is
the
right
that
congress
gave
citizens
the
opportunity
to
vindicate,
if
it
is
vindicated
either
under
the
statute
or
under
article
iii
as
we
see
it,
but
more
strongly
under
the
statute,
because
we
think
you
can
decide
this
under
the
statute.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
justice,
in
that
situation
it
would
be
similar
to
gwaltney,
where
the
was
a
possibility,
a
likelihood
of
recurrence,
and
in
that
case
the
court
could
find
that
there
was...
that
jurisdiction
attaches,
because--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--oh,
we
think
under
epcra
it's
a
very
difficult
standard
to
uphold,
unlike
the
clean
water
act
in
gwaltney,
where
there
was
complicated--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--i
find
it
theoretically
possible,
but
only
on
reading
the
statute
academically.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
that
is
correct.
they
agree
that
the
violation
ceases
on
page
14
of
their
brief.
they
acknowledge
that
the
violation
ceases
on
the
filing
of
the
forms.
this
is
a
case--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--it
does
not,
justice
stevens.
this
is
a
case
about
a
wholly
past
violation,
and
that
is
the
point,
and
under
epcra,
which
is
an
information-gathering
and
information
reporting
statute,
unlike
the
clean
water
act
that
the
court
was
concerned
with
in
gwaltney,
where
there
was...
i
think
the
court
said
the
episodic,
chronic
episodic
instances
of
violation.
this
is
not
likely
to
happen
here
because
of
some
complicated,
especially
engineered
piece
of
equipment
that
might
fail.
likelihood
of
recurrence
is
extremely
remote.
a
party
would
have
to
be
completely
asleep.
so
the
likelihood
of
recurrence,
the
likelihood
of
an
intermittent
injury
here,
and
that's
what
the
court
must
look
at
for
a
recurring
violation,
is
very
remote.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
no,
justice
ginsburg,
they
filed
all
15
forms
that
were
due
within
the
cure
period
and,
as
we
pointed
out
both
parties
rely
on
the
gao
report,
that
many
small
companies
such
as
the
steel
company
simply
were
not
aware
of
their
requirements,
otherwise
dutifully
compliant
with
a
host
of
complex
environmental
laws,
and
their
unawareness...
their
nonfiling
was
an
innocent
unawareness.
but
upon
being
given
this
information,
the
notice,
they
filed,
and
we
think
that's
part
of
the
intent
of
congress
here.
congress
gave
citizen
enforcement
in
two
stages,
first
with
a
notice
and
cure
period,
and
then,
and
only
then,
if
a
party
will
not
heed
or
cannot
heed,
for
whatever
reason,
and
come
into
compliance,
then
congress
gave
citizens
a
very
powerful
weapon
at
the
end
of
that
60
days,
which
was
the
opportunity
to
invoke
the
court's
jurisdiction
and
seek
penalties.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
i
believe,
justice
stevens,
they're
entitled
to
those
fees
if
they're
a
prevailing
party,
but
not
if
they
are
not...
if
they
can't
bring
suit
because
the
defendant
cured
in
the
cure
period.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
the
court
would
be
able
to
look
into...
that
would
be
a
subject
before
the
court
if
they
are
a
prevailing
party
in
a
citizens'
suit,
not
if,
as
here,
there
was
a
cure--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--and
we
believe
not,
justice
breyer.
we
believe
this
is
a
normal
investigation
cost
that
if
the
epa
should
step
in
barring
them
from
a
citizens'
suit
within
a
60-day
period,
they
would
not
be
entitled
to
those
costs.
they're
only
entitled
to
those
costs
as
the
prevailing
or
substantially
prevailing
party,
and
the
question
is,
is,
if
there
is
no
suit,
if
cure
occurs
during
the
first
stage
of
the
congressionally
mandated
two-stage
citizen
action
period,
is
that
a
cost
of
litigation
or
is
that
a
normal
cost
of
their
activities,
which
are
to
assert
their
interest
on
behalf
of
their
members.
so
we
think
their
costs
come
into
it
if
a
party
is
not
able
to
take
heed
of
the
60-day
notice
period
and
not
able
to
cure
within
that
period.
at
that
point,
congress...
the
congressional
goal
is
satisfied,
and
the
congressional
goals
achieved.
compliance
was
achieved
with
this
law.
the
citizens
have
information
that
they...
the
congress
entitled
them
to
have.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
i'm
aware
of
no
provision
in
the
statute
that
would
require
the
latter.
i
believe
it
is...
the
intent
of
the
notice
is
precisely
as
you
have
formulated
it,
to
put
the
party
on
notice
that
they
may
be
out
of
compliance
and
that
they
have
60
days
to
cure,
but
if
at
the
end
of
that
period
they
don't,
the
court's
jurisdiction
could
be
invoked
against
them.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
i
don't
believe
so,
as,
importantly,
most
of
this
information
is
readily
available
through
public
filings
on
the
internet.
this
is...
despite
what
the
seventh
circuit
said,
it
is
not
a
huge
task,
we
don't
believe,
to
investigate
these
various
instances
of
innocent
unawareness,
as
the
case
was
here,
at
least
investment
of
cost,
particularly
for
an
organization
that
is
devoted,
and
has
180,000
dues-paying
members,
devoted
to
this
particular
task.
but
to
be
precise,
we
do
not
believe
it
is
a
very
costly
or
time-intensive
activity
on
behalf
of
the
citizen
organization.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
perhaps,
justice
kennedy,
it
would
be
a
good
idea
to
help
get
the
word
out,
because
as
i
say,
smaller
companies
that
do
not
have
huge
environmental
staffs
that
are
able
to
keep
track
of
all
of
this
have
unfortunately
gotten
caught
in
this.
it
would
not
hurt.
we
were
happy
to
obtain
this
information.
the
steel
company
obtained
it,
and
the
first
thing
they
did
is,
as
a
dutifully
compliant
company,
compliant
with
a
host
of
complex
laws,
said
how
do
we
comply,
and
how
fast
can
we
do
it,
and
can
we
get
in
within
the
cure
period,
and
they
did,
so
there
is
no
history
here
of
a
company
that
is
trying
to
dodge
or
skirt
the
law.
it's
quite
the
contrary.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
it's
perfectly
adequate.
in
fact,
quite...
as
specifically
set
forth
in
the
statute,
section
326(e)
says
that
a
citizen's
suit
is
barred.
the
citizen
organization
is
barred
if
epa
decides
to
assert
its
authority
to
enforce
this
law
within
the
60-day
period.
we
believe...
and
hallstrom
v.
tillamook
looked
at
this.
we
believe
that
that
is
one
of
the
primary
purposes
of
the
notice,
to
prompt
compliance,
or
enforcement
by
epa
or
compliance
by
the
alleged
violator,
that
it
is
epa's
primary
role
to
enforce
these
statutes
and,
as
stated
by
congress,
by
saying
that
if
epa
comes
into
it...
the
case
and
brings
an
administrative
or
judicial
action
within
that
period,
the
citizen
organization
is
barred
from
its
complaint.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
but
your
honor,
the
same
provision,
the
same
opportunity
for
the
epa
to
come
in
and
bar
citizen
action
existed
under
the
clean
water
act
when
it
was
analyzed
by
gwaltney,
and
the
court
found
the
same
reasoning.
the
reason
for
the
notice
to
epa
is
to
give
it
a
chance
to
come
in,
and
the
reason
for
the
notice
to
the
alleged
violator
is
for
the
alleged
violator
to
cure.
the
court
answered
the
question,
what
else
could
be
the
purpose
of
the
notice
to
the
alleged
violator?
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
mr.
chief
justice,
gwaltney
used
the
to
be
in
violation
formula,
and
epcra
uses
the
failure
to
do
formulation.
beyond
that,
there
are
not
a
whole
lot
of
differences
between
the
two
provisions.
to
be
in
violation
and
failure
to
do
are
both
infinitive
phrases.
failure
and
violation
are
both
nouns,
no
temporal
limitation.
this
is
a
information-gathering
statute.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
and
failure
to...
and
the
citizens
can--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--in
gwaltney--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--in
gwaltney,
the
argument
was
advanced
that
to
be
in
violation
also
could
have
a
temporal
limitation--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--well,
we
submit
that
failure
to
do
is,
as
used
here
is
forward-looking
also,
and
gwaltney
studied
the
legislative
history
of
the
clean
water
act...
there's
very
little
of
it
here
in
epcra...
and
the
clean
air
act,
the
templates
that
were
used
for
citizen
provisions,
and
found
that
citizen
provisions
are
intended
to
be
forward-looking.
failure...
understand...
i'll
try
and
make
clear...
i
hope
i
make
clear
that
failure
to
do
is
the
operant...
the
condition
before
a
citizen's
suit
can
be
brought.
in
the
absence
of
the
failure,
a
citizen's
suit
is
not
permitted,
so
failure
to
do
is
a
phrase
which
talks
about
inaction.
in
the
absence
of
inaction,
the
presence
of
action,
a
citizen's
suit
is
barred.
united
musical
found
that.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
your
honor,
if
it
were
that
simple,
it
might
be
easier,
but
they
are
not
asking
for
their
attorneys
fees
alone.
they're
asking
for
$537
million
in
penalties.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
at
the
time
the
complaint
was
filed,
they
had
no
injury.
their
costs
are
a
byproduct
of
their
litigation.
every
party
who
had
some
cost--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--that
is
correct.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
you
find
it
in
the
statute,
which
says
that
they
are
entitled
to
receive
their
cost
if
they
are
the
prevailing
or
substantially
prevailing
party,
but
since
they
can't
get
to
court
because
there
is
no
standing
on
the
day
the
complaint
was
filed,
they
don't
have
the
opportunity
to
prevail,
congress
gave
the
defendant
in
this
case,
who
should
not
be
a
defendant,
the
opportunity
to
cure,
obviating
the
suit.
and
when
gwaltney
studied
this
it
said,
you
know,
the
citizens
don't
get
their
pre-investigation
costs
if
epa
were
to
come
in
either,
so
the
congress
was
not
necessarily
that
interested
in
those
costs,
only
in
the
event
a
party
could
not
heed
the
60-day
notice,
could
not
come
into
compliance,
we
have
severe
costs,
then
they
could
get
those
extraordinary
costs
as
being
the
substantially
prevailing
party.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
relative
to
the
term
under,
the
term
under
appears
27
times
in
section
326,
the
citizen
provision
of
epcra.
we
assert
in
our
briefs
that
under
simply
relates
back,
identifies
the
section
of
the
statute
that
the
citizen
opportunity
refers
to.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
mr.
chief
justice,
ardonesti
v.
ins
says
that
the
term
under
should
be
taken
from
the
context
of
the
statute,
and
the--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--well,
in
any
event--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--in
the
context
of
this
statute,
though,
i
think
in
the
context
of
the
history
surrounding
the
statute,
and
the
context
of
the
way
this
court
has
analyzed
citizen
suit
provisions
as
being
forward-looking,
under
simply
is
a
relation
back.
again,
they...
respondent
suggests
that
under
means
in
accordance
with,
but
at
section
326(a)(1)(b)(iv),
and
again
in
section
321(a)(1)(c),
congress
did
use
the
in
accordance
with
formulation,
and
therefore
congress
knows
how
to
say,
in
accordance
with,
if
it
wishes
to
incorporate
the
specific
provisions
of
the
related-to
section,
and
it
knows
how
to
use
under,
as
it
did
27
times.
so
we
think
the
better
reading,
as
the
united
musical
court
looked
at
it.
under
simply
relates
back,
and
did
not
get
into
what
that
court--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--no,
justice
scalia.
we--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--the...
but
it's
also--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--no.
we
think
that
the
complete
portion
of
the
complete
and
submit
language
suffices
for
that.
a
form
would
certainly
not
be
complete--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--but
we
think
congress
would
not
give
such
an
obviously
glaring
omission
in
a
statute.
the
complete
language
connotes
some
kind
of
completeness
in
terms
of
proper
and
accurately
complete.
that's
what
complete
seems
to
me.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
apply...
if
we're
talking
about
under,
still,
and
the
timeliness
element,
it
would
be
inconsistent
to
apply
the
timely
provisions
of
section
312
and
313,
because
congress
had
readily
available
options
which
it
used
in
other
statutes.
it
could
have
said,
failure
to
complete
and
timely
submit.
it
could
have
said,
failure
to
have
completed
and
submitted.
it
had
many
options.
it
could
have
given
the
opportunity
to--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--well,
by
amending
the
clean
air
act
in
1970...
1990,
to
say
that
the...
they
can
sue
for
a
past
violation
in
the
event
there
is
evidence
of
a
repeated
violation
certainly
doesn't
amend
epcra.
it
only
amends
the
clean
air
act,
or
any
of
the
other
statutes
that
use
these
various
formulations
in
citizen's
suits.
united
musical
drew
strength
from
the
fact
that
congress
amended
the
clean
air
act
but
not
epcra
to
say
epcra
must
mean
what
the
citizen's
60-day
cure
periods
mean
in
17
other
statutes,
all
17
of
which
were
cited
in
a
footnote
in
hallstrom.
so
looking
at
the
case
as
a
whole,
looking
at
the
context,
we
think
that--
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
--no.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
but
we
don't
think
there's
any
likelihood
that
congress
would
have
done
that
without
citing
any
of
that
in
its
legislative
history
of
the
clean
air
act.
mr.
sanford
m.
stein
thank
you.
