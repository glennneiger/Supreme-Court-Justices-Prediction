justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
significant
point
there's
no
such
allegation
in
this
case?
they
don't
allege,
if
i
remember
the
complaint,
that
there's
a
likelihood
you
will
not
comply.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
complaint
does
not
allege
a
concern
about
future
violations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
stein,
can
i
ask
you,
with
regard
to
attorneys
fees
and
the
like,
they
ask
in
their
complaint
for
all
costs
in
connection
with
the
investigation
and
prosecution
of
this
matter,
including
fees,
attorneys
fees
and
expert
witness
fees.
now,
do
you
agree
that
the
statute
authorizes
the
award
of
the
investigation
costs
before
suit
was
filed,
or
when
they
were
trying
to
make
up
their
mind
whether
to
file
suit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
asking,
if
they
are
a
prevailing
party,
you
agree
they
get
the
pre-suit
investigation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
couldn't
have
used
that
language
here.
i
mean,
if
he
complies...
well,
anyway,
i'm
sorry.
i'll
withdraw
my
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
think...
how
you
can
agree
with
that,
because
the
complaint
doesn't
allege
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
so
forth,
but
you
don't
allege
there's
any
risk
of
continuing
violations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
your
burden,
normally
you
have
to
make
an
allegation
then
try
and
prove
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it's
relevant
to
the
question
of
standing,
because
we're
trying
to
focus
on
exactly
what--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
injury
is,
and
if
your
injury
is
a
fear
of
continuing
violations,
you
could
allege
that
and
presumably
prove
it,
if
they
were
people
who
didn't
obey
the
law
over
and
over
again.
but
here,
the
facts
don't
seem
to
suggest
that,
and
it's
not
alleged
in
the
complaint.
the
only
injury
that
you
refer
to
in
the
briefs
and
all
is
a
costs
of
investigation
which
you
want
to
get
reimbursed
for,
but
you
don't
allege
in
your
complaint
you
have
any
costs
of
investigation,
either.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no.
you
generally
follow
what
happens
in
the
environmental
community.
i
don't
think
you
allege
you
spent
any
money
beyond
your
normal,
routine
expenses
in
investigating
this
company.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
allege
it,
is
what
i'm
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
all
you'd
have
to
do
is
say,
we
think
you're
discharging
certain
substances
into
the
air,
you've
filed
no
report,
and
we
think
you
have
a
duty
to
do
so.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
have
to
know
the
details.
even
if
it's
just
an
ounce
there's
a
duty
to
file...
maybe
there's
a
minimum
threshold.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
certainly
could
have
at
the
time
you
filed
your
complaint,
because
they
had
already
filed
their
reports
which
told
you
those
facts.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
when
you
have
to
file
your
rule
11
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
rule
11
applies
at
the
time
you
file
the
complaint.
you
had
all
the
facts
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
it
also
seems
clear
to
me
as
we
talk
about
it
more
that
at
the
time
you
filed
the
complaint
your
principal
injury,
which
was
you
were
denied
this
information
for
a
time
when
you
were
entitled
to
it,
you
had
got
the
information
by
the
time
you
filed
the
complaint.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
going
to
get
any
redress
in
this
complaint
for
harms
caused
by
your
failure
to
have
that
information
3
months
ago.
you
don't
get
a
remedy
for,
we
had
to
close
our
windows
to
keep
the
odors
out,
or
something
like
that.
you
don't
get
relief
for
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--for
which
you
are
not
redressed
by
this
proceeding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
there,
because
it's
quite
important.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you're
saying
the
reasonable
likelihood
of
recurrence
is
critical
to
the
standing
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
not
alleged
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say,
well,
it
might
be
in
other
cases,
but
assume
it
were
alleged
in
another
case
but
not
proved.
it's
a
very
difficult
thing
to
prove,
if
you
have
a
company
like
this
with
a
history
of
just
an
inadvertence
and
so
forth.
you
are
saying
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
prove
there
is
a
reasonable
likelihood
they
would
not
file
in
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
can
allege
it
without
proving
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
all
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
it
could
have
used
the
language
it
did
in
all
these
other
statutes,
too.
but
what's
your
response
to
his
argument
when
congress
amended
the
other
statute
in
response
to
gwaltney
they
just
didn't
adopt
this
route?
