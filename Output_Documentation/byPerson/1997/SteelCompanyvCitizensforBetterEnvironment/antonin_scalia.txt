justice
antonin
scalia
you're
asking
us
to
read
the
provision
in
such
a
way
that
nobody
would
have
an
incentive
to
file
suit.
if
you
say
that...
even
when
suit
will
properly
lie,
according
to
you,
initially,
that
is,
suit
is
filed
before
the
defendant
comes
into
compliance,
you're
saying
that
suit
will
be
washed
out
when
the
defendant
complies.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
would
anybody
file
a
suit?
i
can't
understand
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
shouldn't
we
say
that...
i
guess
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
issue
in
this
case,
but
why
couldn't
the
situation
be
that
so
long
as
you
have
not
filed
before...
after
the
60-day
period
and
before
suit
is
filed
against
you,
you
are
liable
for
the
penalty
that's
set
forth
in
the
civil
provision.
would
that
contradict
your
theory
of
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
file
after
suit,
and
after
the
60
days,
if
you
come
into
compliance
with
the
law
after
the
suit
is
filed
and
after
the
60-day
period,
why
isn't
it
reasonable
to
say
that
the
federal
government
intended
to
give
these
private
attorney
generals
the
right
to
the
penalties
accruing?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it's
mooted
as
soon
as--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
penalty
alone
cannot
suffice
to
sustain
a
suit,
the
right
to
the
penalty
alone.
justice
antonin
scalia
assume
no
possibility
of
further
violations,
it's
your
position
that
the
plaintiff's
entitlement
to
the
penalty
alone
wouldn't
make
any
difference?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
isn't
an
adequate
explanation
of
the
60-day
cure
period
that
that's
the
period
provided
so
that
epa
itself
might
come
in,
instead
of
having
the
private
plaintiffs
do
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
that
provision
not
existed
i
would...
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
strong
argument
that
the
only
possible
reason
for
the
60-day
period
is
to
give
the
defaulting
company
an
opportunity
to
make
good,
and
if
the
company
makes
good,
then
suit
cannot
be
brought
after
the
60
days,
but
there
is
another
explanation
for
the
60
days,
as
you
said.
it's
to
allow
epa
to
come
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
temporal...
to
be
in
violation,
you're
currently
in
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
failure
to
do
means
you
may
have
failed
to
do
it
in
the
past,
and
you
failed
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
you
later
made
good
that
failure,
you
did
fail
to
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
a
bad
argument.
this
isn't
a
bad
argument.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
such
evidence
would
allow
this
suit
to
proceed
anyway,
on
the
theory
that
there's
likely
to
be
a
repetition.
opposing
counsel
acknowledges
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
you
don't
have
any
cause
of
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
must
know
something
to
bring
a
suit,
and
you
don't
know
it,
you
don't
have
a
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
would
suffice
for
standing
for
everybody
to
get
the
costs
of
bringing
the
suit,
gee,
everybody
would
have
standing
for
any
suit
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
--whatever
it
cost
you
to
bring
the
suit
gives
you
standing
to
bring
the
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
attorney's
fees
is
narrower.
i
think
it's
broader.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
you're
saying
that
this
material
is...
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
you're
arguing
that
it's
two
different
things.
first
you're
arguing
it
is
an
independent
damage
and
not
associated
with
attorney's
fees
because
we
wouldn't
have
known
what
stuff
was
in
the
air.
then,
you
get
damages
for
this
by
calling
it
attorney's
fees,
or
litigation...
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
do
this
investigation
in
order
to
bring
the
lawsuit,
in
which
case
you
can't
rely
on
that
for
standing,
or,
did
you
do
it
not
in
order
to
bring
the
lawsuit,
in
which
case
it's
not
part
of
your
cause
of
action?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
depends
on
why
they
were
undertaken,
why
these
investigations
were
undertaken.
were
they
undertaken
in
order
to
bring
this
lawsuit?
in
that
case,
the
statute
gives
you
a
right
to
them,
but
i
question
whether
you
have
standing--
justice
antonin
scalia
--have
article
iii
standing.
on
the
other
hand,
were
they
conducted
not
in
order
to
bring
the
lawsuit,
but
just
because
you
wanted
to
know
what
was
out
there
in
hyde
park,
or
wherever,
in
which
case
you
clearly
would
have
standing,
but
you
have
no
cause
of
action
under
this
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
it
relates
to
whether
they
constitute
litigation
costs.
if
you
would
have
done
this
stuff
anyway,
they're
not
litigation
costs,
which
is
all
that
you've
asked
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
they
based
on--
--all
they
show
is
that
if
there
was
originally
standing,
that
there
was...
it
was
established
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
continuing
violation.
that
simply
does
not
eliminate
the
prior
established
standing.
it's
a
huge
leap
from
that
to
say
that
in
and
of
itself
it
establishes
standing.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
agree
with
that
if
the
complaint
alleged
before
the
voluntary
compliance
occurred
that
this
person
was
in
violation
and
would
continue
in
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
was
the
name
of
that
case--
justice
antonin
scalia
--so
you
think
if
you
filed
a
statement
of
emissions
that
was
entirely
wrong,
all
the
elements
and
all
the
quantities
are
wrong,
you'd...
suit
would
not
lie?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
been
filed
under
that
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
just
not
in
compliance
with
it,
that's
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
completed.
there's
no
blank
in
the
whole
thing.
he
just
writes
in
the
wrong
elements
and
the
wrong
quantities.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
later
congress'
amendment
doesn't
necessarily
show
what
the
earlier
congress
meant,
anyway.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
as
reasonable
to
think
the
amendment
was
meant
to
change
what
preexisted
as
it
is
to
think
that
it
was
meant
to
confirm
what
preexisted,
isn't
it?
