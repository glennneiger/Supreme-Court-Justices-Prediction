mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me
begin
with
the
language
of
section
326
of
epcra,
the
citizen's
suit
provision,
both
what
it
is
and
what
it
is
not.
section
326
provides
that
a
citizen
may
bring
a
suit
for
a
failure
to
complete
and
submit
a
form
under
section
312,
or
under
section
313.
that
citizen's
suit
provision
does
not
occur,
that
form
of
citizen's
suit
provision
does
not
occur
anywhere
else.
the
kind
of
citizen's
suit
provision
that
was
before
the
court
in
gwaltney
used
the
term,
alleged
to
be
in
violation.
that
provision
is
ubiquitous
throughout
citizen's
suit
provisions
that
congress
has
enacted.
alleged--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--the
venue
provision
uses
the
word
occur,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
what
i'm
focusing
on
is
the
provision
that
authorizes
citizen's
suits,
which
in
those
three
statutes
contains
the
phrase,
alleged
to
be
in
violation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
this
statute
does
not
contain
the
phrase,
alleged
to
be
in
violation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it
says,
failure
to
complete
and
submit
a
form.
the
alleged
to
be
in
violation
formulation,
which
is
the
formulation
that
the
court
held
in
gwaltney,
a
case
with
facts
somewhat
parallel
to
this,
led
to
the
conclusion
for
which
petitioners
contend.
that
formulation
does
not
occur
in
this
statute.
what
this
statute
contains
is
the
phrase,
failure
to
complete
and
submit
a
form
under
section
312
and
section
313.
the
evidence
that
this
is
a
deliberate
choice
by
congress
is
really
quite
overwhelming.
in
the
very
same
public
law
that
enacted
epcra,
congress
also
enacted
the
superfund
amendments.
the
superfund
amendments
contain
a
citizen's
suit
provision.
that
citizen's
suit
provision
used
the
alleged
to
be
in
violation
formulation.
epcra
used
a
different
one.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
stevens,
then
they
could
have
used
that
language.
alleged
to
be
in
violation,
had
it
been
used
in
epcra,
would
lead
quite
logically--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
there's...
the
requirement
in
epcra
is
that
you
file
a
form
by
a
certain
date,
and
what
the
statute
says
is,
failure
to
complete
and
submit
a
form
under
sections
312
and
313.
sections
312
and
313
contain
deadlines,
and
it
seems
to
us
that
if
you
do
not
you
are
guilty
of
a
failure
to
complete
and
submit
a
form
under
section
312
if
you
don't
meet
the
deadlines
in
312.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
then
i
think--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
justice
o'connor,
then
i
don't
know
why
the
language
about
under
that
section
would
be
in
the
statute,
failure
to
complete
and
submit
a
form
under
section
312.
in
fact,
i'm--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
i'm
actually...
i'm
actually
omitting
a
part
of
the
statute.
it
says,
failure
to
complete
and
submit
an
inventory
form
under
section
312,
so
the
reference
to
section
312
wasn't
even
needed
to
say
which
form
they
had
in
mind.
and
not
only
that,
justice
o'connor,
but
it's
quite
clear
from
the
structure
of
the
statute
and
from
the
purposes
of
the
statute
that
timeliness
is
not
an
incidental
requirement.
timeliness
is
at
the
core
of
what
the
statute
is
about.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
absolutely,
justice
o'connor,
and
mr.
stein
referred
to
it
as
a
60-day
cure
provision,
which
is
a
curious
reference
for
a
number
of
reasons.
here's
one.
the
clean
air
act
contained
the
phrase,
alleged
to
be
in
violation.
after
this
court's
decision
in
gwaltney,
congress...
it
also
has
a
notice
period.
after
gwaltney,
this
court
amended,
or
the
congress
amended
the
clean
air
act
to
include
the
phrase,
or
to
have
violated,
making
it
clear
that
gwaltney
was
not
to
apply
to
the
clean
air
act,
but
congress
left
the
notice
period
intact
in
the
clean
air
act.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes,
exactly
so,
justice
ginsburg.
alleged
to
have
violated,
if
there
is
evidence
that
the
violation
has
been
repeated,
but
that
could
still
be
entirely
in
the
past.
it
could
be
a
violation
in
the
past,
repeated
in
the
past.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
that's
right,
justice
scalia.
what--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
justice
stevens,
what
we
do
in
the
complaint,
we
ask
for
an
injunction
that
will
allow
us
to
look
at
their
property
in
the
records.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
stevens,
we
don't
know.
we
don't
know
what
the
story
is.
all
we
know
is,
they
didn't
file.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
don't
know
whether
they
would
or
would
not.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--justice
scalia,
we
don't
see
anywhere
in
the
statute
where
it
says
this
has
to
be
a
repeat
violation.
it
says
there
has
to
be
a
failure
to
submit
a
form
under
a
section
with
a
deadline,
a
deliberately
chosen
provision
that
differs
from
all
other
citizen's
suit
provisions.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
what
we
pled
was,
what
we
asked
for
was
authorization
to
inspect
their
property.
we
may
know
down
the
road
whether
they
are
right
in
saying
that
they
simply
didn't
know
about
the
statute
and
now
they've
gotten
everything
in
order,
or
maybe
that's
not
the
case.
we
just
don't
know.
this
complaint
was
dismissed.
but
the
statute
doesn't
contain
any
reference
to
repetition.
the
statute
says,
a
failure
to
complete
and
submit.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
mm-hmm.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
allege
in
the
complaint
that
we
undertook
an
investigation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
oh,
absolutely,
justice
stevens.
we
conducted
an
investigation
of
this
company--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i
think
we
allege
in
there
that
we
conducted
an
investigation
of
the
company,
but
i'll
find
the
page
reference.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
scalia,
that's--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that's
right,
but
that's--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--here's
why
this
statute
is...
here's
why
this
statute
is
different,
justice
scalia,
and
why
that
argument,
which
is,
of
course,
right,
does
not
apply,
and
the
point
justice
kennedy
and
justice
breyer
made
in
their
questions
to
my
colleague.
in...
before
we
could
file
the
notice,
we
had
to
conduct
an
investigation
to
find
out
information
that
they,
had
they
been
complying
with
the
law,
would
have
made
readily
available.
because
they
didn't
comply
with
the
law
and
make
this
information
available,
we
had
to
dig
it
out.
if
we
win
the
case,
we'll
get
the
money
back
that
will
compensate
us
for
doing
work
we
only
had
to
do
because
they
didn't
give
us
the
information.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
whether
they
filed
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--whether
they
filed
the
report
is
on
the
internet,
justice
o'connor.
what
is
not
on
the
internet
is
that
they
use
and
release
large
amounts
of
hydrochloric
acid
from
their
premises.
we
can't
go
on
their
premises.
we
have
to
put...
piece
together
from
various...
from
tips
from
people
in
the
community
and
various
sources
of
information--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--in
this
case
they
filed
no
report.
because
they
filed
no
report,
we
had
to
dig
out
information
that
should
have
been
publicly
available.
the
purpose
of
the
act
is
to
make
this
information
available
to
us
and
our
members.
it
wasn't,
because
they
violated
it.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
that's
right,
mr.
chief
justice,
or
the
reverse
of
that,
that
because
they
didn't
file
reports,
we
had
to
dig
this
information
out.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
they
filed
no
report.
we
dug
it
out
to
determine
whether
they
had
failed
to
file
a
report.
this
goes
to
the--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--excuse
me.
whether
they
failed
to
file
a
report
that
they
should
have
filed.
whether
they
had
on
their
premises
the
kind
of
substances
that
trigger
the
obligation
to
file
a
report.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
souter,
the
notice
provision
says
notice
of
the
alleged
violation.
i
think
if
we
sent
the
petitioner
just
a
general
notice
that
said,
we
think
you're
violating
epcra,
with
no
specifics,
they
would
be
justified
in
coming
in
when
we
brought
suit
and
saying,
you
didn't
give
us
60
days'
notice
of
the
alleged
violation.
you
have
to
tell
us
more
than
just,
we
think
you're
violating
the
law.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
we
have
to
determine
that
they
are
discharging
or
have
on
their
premises
certain
substances,
which
it's
not
easy
to
do.
it's
not
easy
to
determine
not
only
certain
substances,
but
the
quantities
have
to
exceed
certain
thresholds.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
there's
a
threshold.
they
have
to
exceed
the
threshold.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
breyer,
the
statutory
provision
authorizes
an
award
of
litigation
costs.
this
court
has
said
actually
that
a
more
narrow
provision
authorizing
just
attorney's
fees
that
the
work
must
be
useful
and
of
a
type
ordinarily
necessary.
that's
the
standard
the
court
has
used.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
this
says
litigation
costs--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
this
says
litigation
costs...
including
attorney's
fees
and
expert
witness
fees...
suggesting
that
it's
broader.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
let
me
first
address
the
point
about
circularity,
justice
souter,
because
i
do
understand
the
circularity
point,
and
here
is
why
we
are
not
making
a
circular
argument
about
attorney's
fees.
one
of
the
injuries
they
inflicted
on
us
was
not
giving
us
information
we
and
our
members
had
a
statutory
right
to.
as
a
result
of
that,
we
had
to
dig
out
that
information
ourselves.
if
we
win,
we
get
our
costs
of
digging
that
out,
therefore
our
injury
is
redressed.
a
suit
under
the
clean
water
act,
you
don't
have
to
clean
up
the
water.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
litigation
costs
provision
is
the
provision
that
gives
us
a
right
to
that--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--to
those
expenses.
the
reason
it
gives
us
a
right
to
those
expenses,
to
answer
justice
breyer's
question
on
that
score,
is,
we
couldn't
have
signed
a
rule
11
statement
had
we
not
conducted
that
investigation.
we
couldn't
have
signed
a
statement
saying
we
believe
they
have
hydrochloric
acid
on
their
premises
had
we
not
gone
out
and
dug
up
that
information.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
but
we
had
to--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
but
the
complaint
had
to
follow
on
a
notice
of
the
alleged
violation,
otherwise
the
complaint
would
be
jurisdictionally
barred.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that's
right,
but
then
it's
a
jurisdictional
prerequisite
to
the
complaint.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
justice
stevens,
what
the
statute
guarantees
is
timely
information.
people
who
moved
into
petitioner's
neighborhood--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--in
1990
aren't
benefited
by
knowing
in
1995
that
they've
been
exposed--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--no.
that
is
the
injury.
that
is
the
injury,
justice
stevens.
the
redress--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--that
injury...
that
injury
that
we
did
not
have
the
information
is
redressed
only
to
the
extent
that
when
we
dug
it
out
we
will
now
get
paid
back
for
mitigating
the
injury
they
inflicted
on
us.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
it's
litigation
costs,
justice
ginsburg,
and
i
agree
this
would
not
apply
to
an
agency
proceeding,
but
the
court
has
made
it
clear
that
litigation
costs
or
attorney's
fees
include
work
that
goes
into
developing
the
complaint,
as,
of
course
it
would
have
to,
investigation
you
have
to
do
in
order
to
develop,
as
in
the
court's
words,
the
work
associated
with
the
development
of
the
theory
of
the
case,
and
the
drafting
of
the
initial
pleadings.
that
sort
of
pre-complaint
work
has
to
be
covered
by
the
term.
it's
an
integral,
indispensable
part
of
litigation.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
the
question--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--as
i
understand
the
standing
issue,
justice
scalia,
the
question
is,
are
our
injuries
being
redressed?
if
we
win
this
lawsuit,
our
injuries
will
be
redressed.
they'll
happen
to
be
redressed
under
a
provision
that
says,
litigation
costs,
but
that's
immaterial
to
the
article
iii
question.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
i
think
they
were--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
they
were
undertaken
for
both
purposes,
justice
scalia.
what
cbe
does
is
to
find
out
information
about
the
communities
and
if
someone
is
in
violation
of
the
law
bring
suit
against
them,
but
i
don't
know
why
our
purpose
in
doing
this
should
be
material
to
the
redressability
inquiry.
our
injury
will
get
redressed.
the
fact
that
it
will
get
redressed
under
a
litigation
cost
rubric,
i
don't
see
where
that
bears
on
the
article
iii
problem.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
well,
that
goes
to
the
statutory
question
of
whether
they
are
litigation
costs.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
yes.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
no,
i--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--i--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--well,
we--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--we--
mr.
david
a.
strauss
--we...
well,
we
do
ask
for
an
injunction
in
this
case.
we
do
ask
for
an
injunction
to
look
at
their
materials.
as
for
the
question
of
the
circularity
and
supporting
any
case,
what's
different
about
this
statute
is
that
in
order
to
bring
this
suit
we
have
to
remedy
the
injury
that
was
inflicted
on
us
in
order
to
bring
the
suit.
usually,
litigants
don't
have
to
do
that.
mr.
david
a.
strauss
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
