mr.
frederick,
may
i
go
back
to
the
question
that
was...
i
think
justice
o'connor
asked
you,
and
that
is,
you
said
that
there
could
be
a
fourth
amendment
control
of
excessive
force.
what
would
be
the
implementation
of
that?
suppose
the
agents
here
had
come
in
like
gangbusters
and
destroyed
everything
in
their
path,
and
also
picked
up
some
incriminating
evidence,
what
would
be
the
consequences?
you
said
the
fourth
amendment
is
involved,
how?
do
we
exclude
the
evidence
that
would
be
garnered
in
such
an
unreasonable
search?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
does
it
do
anything
other
than
what
our
decision
says
the
fourth
amendment
does
with
respect
to
the
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
you
really
don't...
this
is
just
kind
of
a
statement
that
doesn't
matter,
because
the
fourth
amendment
certainly
binds
federal
officers.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
levine--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
didn't
understand
the
difference
between
a
kicked-down
door,
which
was...
which
case
was
that?
that
was
richards--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
a
rammed
door.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
does
more
damage
than
breaking
one
windowpane.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
are
you
suggesting
that
the
standard
that
this
court
said
was
proper
in
those
two
cases
wasn't
tight
enough
because
there
was
damage
to
property?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
and
in
wilson,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
they
both
involved,
not
just
walking
through
a
door
gently.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
think
mr.
frederick
said
something
about
inevitable
discovery.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
they
were
authorized
to
go
in
without
knocking
and
announcing.
if
they
had
simply
done
that
and
not
broken
the
window
as
well,
they
would
have
found
the
same
things.
