chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1469,
united
states
v.
hernan
ramirez.
mr.
frederick.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
did
the
officers
do
here
by
way
of
property
damage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
question.
did
the
sabbath
case
take
any
position
on
whether
there
might
be
an
exclusionary
rule
in
connection
with
the
violation
of
3109?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no...
i
see
now
in
the
first
paragraph
it
says,
we
hold
the
method
of
entry
vitiated
the
arrest
and
therefore
that
evidence
seized
in
the
subsequent
search
should
not
have
been
admitted
at
petitioner's
trial.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
if
we
say
this
violates
3109,
unless
we
do
something
to
sabbath
you
get
an
exclusionary
rule
right
along
with
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
did
it
come
from--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
said
the
reasonableness
of
the
fortifications.
you
don't
mean
that,
do
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
reacting
to
them.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
mr.
levine,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
mean
presently
armed
in
the
sense
of
right
then
at
6:00
in
the
morning
he
had
a
gun
on
him?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
you
first
answer
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
district
court
found
that
mr.
shelby
was
not
"presently"
armed.
are
you
suggesting
that
this
finding
means
that
at
6:15
in
the
morning
he
was
not
presently
armed?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
would
have...
you
would
then
require,
in
order
to
break
the
window
of
a
garage
door,
that
the
police
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
person
was
armed,
i
suppose
carrying
a
gun,
at
the
very
moment
they
were
going
to
break
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
doesn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
they
want
more
specific
evidence
of
danger
if
there's
going
to
be
property
damage?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
break
in
a
garage
window.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
levine,
you're
saying,
then,
it's
not
reasonable
for
the
police
to
break
a
garage
window,
a
pane
of
glass,
after
they've
been
informed
that
there
may
be
guns
in
the
garage
and
that
shelby
is
armed
and...
could
be
armed
and
dangerous?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr....
just
a
minute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
calm
down.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
not
suggesting
that
the
police
have
to
do
what
is
most
reasonable,
are
you?
the
test
is
whether
what
they
did
was
"reasonable".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
says
that
to
read
the
statute
as
literally
as
you
suggest
would
be
inconsistent
with
our
miller
opinion
in
'58.
what's
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
the
same
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
statute
says
nothing
about
excluding
evidence
that
was
obtained
in
violation
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
levine.
mr.
frederick.
mr.
frederick,
may
i
ask
you
this
question:
you
know,
i
can
understand
the
government's
feeling
that
on
the
facts
this
case
shouldn't
have
come
out
this
way,
and
that
was
also
what
the
dissenting
opinion
of
judge
kozinski
said,
but
he
didn't
say
that
you
cannot
take
into
account...
he
didn't
criticize
the
general
rule
of
the
ninth
circuit
that
you
can't
take
into
account
the
manner
of
entry,
including
the
breaking
of
property,
in
deciding
whether
it's
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
i
don't
understand
what
new
rule
to
replace
the
california
formulation
of
the
test
you
want
us
to
adopt.
i...
i'm...
which
makes
it
hard
to
write
an
opinion.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
the
case
is
submitted.
