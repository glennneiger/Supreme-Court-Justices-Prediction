mr.
michael
r.
levine
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
6:15
in
the
morning
of
november
5th,
45
armed
officers
surrounded
the
home
of
mr.
ramirez.
they
planned
this.
this
wasn't
something
that
arose
spontaneously
at
the
door,
like
in
richards
v.
wisconsin.
this
wasn't
a
case
where
they
were
recognized
as
officers
where
they
had
to
take
an
immediate
action,
kick
in
the
door.
this
was
a
planned
breaking
of
a
window
of
a
residence.
who
among
us
would
not
have
risen
to
the
defense
of
our
wives?
who
among
us
would
not
have
arisen
to
the
defense
of
our
children?
50
percent
of
americans
have
guns
in
their
homes.
the
government
should
have
thought
this
through
a
little
better.
the
norm,
this
honorable
court,
the
norm
from
time
immemorial,
from
semayne's
case
and
even...
even
before,
as
wilson
points
out,
the
norm
has
been
that
before
officers
may
break
and
enter
the
home,
our
last
refuge
in
this
world
that's
shrinking
smaller
and
smaller
all
the
time,
before
they
can
make
that
entry,
they
have
to
announce
their
identity,
they
have
to
announce
their
purpose--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--it's
a
weighing
standard.
the
ninth
circuit
is
not
applying
a
two-tiered
test.
the
ninth
circuit
is
applying
a
weighing
standard.
it's
balancing
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
and
the
risks
of
the
intrusion
against
the
need
that
the
government
has
to
go
in.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
talking
about
a
broken
windowpane.
we're
talking
about
a
broken
windowpane
that
the
foreseeable
consequences
of
which...
the
foreseeable
consequences
of
which
create
danger
of
life--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--it
may
well.
it
may
well,
but
generally
speaking,
justice
kennedy,
generally
speaking
the
destruction
of
a
door
or
a
window
is
going
to
create
a
much
greater
risk
than
going
through
a
pass
key,
because
the--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
i
think
the
assump...
the
purpose
of
the
knock
and
announce
rule
has...
one
of
its
fundamental
purposes
is
the
protection
of
property.
the
reason
is
that...
and
the
protection
of
the
safety
of
the
residents.
common
law
recognized
that
when
people
break
property,
people
will
be
frightened
and
will
spring
to
the
defense
of
themselves
and
their
family,
and
will
engage
in
a
shoot-out.
things
will
escalate.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
you
would
look
at
a
balancing
test,
your
honor.
the
ninth
circuit
is
simply
saying,
as
it
has
done
for
23
years,
case
after
case
after
case,
the
ninth
circuit
has
a
million
variations
on
these
themes.
it
has
a
general
rule
that
helps
guide
its
application
of
the
rule
of
reason.
the
general
rule
is
that
where's
there's
damage
to
property,
and
the
ninth
circuit
understands
that
they're
not
talking
about
a
scratch
on
the
door,
or
they're
not
talking
about
a
piece
of
wood
or
a
flower
that's
stepped
on--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
depending
on
all
the
circumstances
again,
your
honor,
i
mean,
there
are
thousands
of
hypotheticals
which
will--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--are
you
referring
to
richards
v.
wisconsin,
your
honor?
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--the
statement
in
richards
v.
wisconsin,
the
test
of
reasonable
suspicion
that
the
government
talks
about
and
that
this
court
talked
about,
though,
in
the
context
of
destruction
of
evidence,
that
has
to
be
construed
at
least
with
regard
to
a
planned
assault
on
a
residence,
as
opposed
to
a
spontaneous
happening
at
the
door,
that
has
to
be
construed,
it
seems
to
me,
to
include
the
manner
of
entry
and
the
degree
of
danger.
it's
like
tennessee
v.
garner.
the
government
just
wants
to
have
a
quantum
reasonable
suspicion,
but
that's
not
what
you
did
in
tennessee
v.
garner.
that
was
the
case
where
you
said
the
police
officer
couldn't
shoot
the
fleeting
felon.
you
have
to
consider
the
end
result,
the
fleeing
of
the...
the
death
of
the
felon.
in
winston
v.
lee,
which
garner
cites,
you
recall
that
was
the
case
where
the
police
wanted
to
compel
surgery
to
remove
a
bullet
from
the
suspected
robber,
and
they
said
they
need
to
get
the
bullet,
and
this
court
said
quite
clearly
that,
wait
a
minute,
what's
the
danger
if
we
remove
the
bullet?
we
have
to
balance
that.
what
is
the
government's
interest
in
getting
the
bullet?
and
at
first
the
bullet
was
only
half
an
inch,
and
they
said,
well,
that's
okay,
go
ahead,
but
then
it
turned
out
the
bullet
was
a
lot
closer,
this
person
might
die.
justice
scalia,
writing
for
a
unanimous
court
in
whren,
i
believe
last
term,
you
said
that
there's
a
certain
class
of
cases,
a
narrow
class
of
cases
like
tennessee
v.
garner,
like
winston
v.
lee,
like
welsh
v.
wisconsin,
the
case
where
the
police
chased
a
man
in
through
the
house
without
a
warrant
to
get...
they
wanted
to
arrest
him
for
drunk
driving
in
order
to
get...
they
said,
we
have
to
preserve
the
evidence.
you
put
in
that
class
no-knock
entry,
wilson
v.
arkansas,
because
you
said
in
that
narrow
class
of
cases
we
have
to
do
a
full
balancing
test,
and
that
was
a
unanimous
court.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
if--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--no,
your
honor.
if--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--if
that
test...
first
of
all,
you
did
not
consider
any
safety
interests
in
richards
v.
wisconsin,
understandably.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no.
you
should...
you
either
have
to
modify
the
test
or
interpret
the
test
to
mean
reasonable
suspicion
under
the
circumstances,
including
the
method
of
entry,
sort
of
a
la...
sort
of
like,
excuse
me,
winston
v.
lee,
incorporating
the
manner
of
entry
into
the
circumstances,
or
you
have
to
adjust
the
other
end.
when
you
say
danger,
well,
what
kind
of
danger?
mr.
michael
r.
levine
dangerous
to
whom?
mr.
michael
r.
levine
it
did,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
you
have
to
flesh
out
richards,
i
guess
would
be
my
terminol--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
your
honor--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--there's
no
question
that
mr.
shelby
was
not
a
model
citizen.
there's
no
question
that
he
was
a...
in
the
past
he
had
committed
violent
and
horrible
crimes.
there's
no--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--but
that's
not--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--that's
not
the
question.
that
shouldn't
be
the
test.
the
test
has
to
be,
do
they
have...
in
light
of
the
way
they
entered...
in
light
of
the
way
they
entered,
do
they
have,
at
the
very
least,
a
reasonable
belief
that
he
presents
a
present
imminent
danger
to
the
police.
if
the
standard
is
simply
danger--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--i
understand
their--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
that's
not
enough,
because
there
has
to
be
evidence
in
the
record
to
show
the
basis
for
their
belief.
there's
no
testimony
at
the
hearing.
there
was...
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
mr.
shelby
was
presently
armed
in
the
residence,
or
that
he
presented
the
threat--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
many
of
the...
most
of
the
cases
that
talk
about...
let's
take
a
look
at--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--yes,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
it
finds...
it
means
that
he
was
not
presently...
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
was
presently
armed
or
that
he--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--or,
unless
there
was
evidence
that
he
had
ready
access
to
a
gun
and
there
was
no
evidence
of
that.
the
only
evidence
in
this
case
was
that...
was
a
supposition,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
the
record
is
clear.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
in
the
past,
it's
true.
in
the
past.
but
there
was
no
evidence
that
he
possessed
a
gun
while
in
the
ramirez
residence.
if
you
make
an
exception
for
dangerous
people
you're
creating
the
very
blanket
rule
that
you
condemned
in
richards.
it's
not--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
the
no-knock--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--no,
i...
no.
i'm
not
getting
into
tactics.
i--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--what
i'm
saying
is
the
officer...
frankly,
your
honor,
the
officer--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--no.
no,
i
don't
want
you--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--no.
no.
i
don't
want
you
to
parse
this
and
say
there
are
two
levels.
i--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
that's
what
they
say,
and
that's
their
way
of
helping
them
in
the
balancing
test.
that's
informing
their
balancing
test.
i
point,
your
honor,
to
petitioner's
appendix
11a,
where
the
ninth
circuit
also
says,
we
have
touched
upon
all
of
these
cases
because
our
review
is
necessarily
fact-bound.
our
cases
do
not
describe
a
simple
straight
line.
police
must
have
some
leeway
in
balancing
the
demands
of
the
knock
and
announce
requirement
against
other
safety
considerations.
nevertheless,
the
courts
must
ultimately
determine
whether
the
police
struck
that
balance
properly.
i
read
that
language
as
saying
they're
doing
a
balancing,
and
this
word,
this
mild
exigency
showing
more
is
simply
saying,
if
there's
a
greater
intrusion,
give
us
more
evidence
justifying
the
intrusion.
that's
all
they're
doing.
and
if
you
read
mcconney,
the
en
banc
decision
of
the
court
in
1973,
you
see
that
they
begin
immediately
saying
that
the
test
is
a
reasonable
belief
in
danger,
but
as
a
specific
application
of
that
test
we
look
to
whether...
one
factor,
an
important
factor
is
what
they're
saying,
ultimately.
an
important
factor
is
property
damage,
and
it
generally
is
an
important
factor.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes.
yes,
and
generally
speaking
that's
true.
generally
speaking,
if
you're
going
to
break
in
a
door
we
want
to
have
a
higher
justifi--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--a...
your
honor,
we
are
most
vulnerable...
yes,
is
the
answer
to
your
question.
we
are
most
vulnerable
when
we
are
asleep
with
our
families.
when
we
hear
the
shattering
of
glass
at
6:15
in
the
morning,
we
are
terrified,
we...
and
the
record
is
clear
here
that
these
folks,
just
like
many
of
us...
maybe
not
all
of
us...
would
think
we
were
being
burglarized.
we...
we
were
being
invaded.
we
defend
our
children
with
our
lives,
if
necessary.
the
officers
should
have
thought
about
that.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i
understand.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well...
well,
first
of
all--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--let's
look
at
the
factual
predicate.
i
agree,
we
have
stipulated,
and
we
stand
by
the
stipulation.
that
is
the
record.
the
informant
said
there
were
supposed
to
be
guns
in
the
garage.
the
informant,
this
reliable
informant
is
giving
the
best
case,
presumably.
now,
he's
not
saying
i
saw
shelby
with
a
gun.
he's
not
saying,
i
overheard
shelby
to
say
he
was
going
to
shoot
police
when
he
comes
in,
and
remember,
the
origin
of
the
officer
safety
exception
comes
from
reed
v.
case,
where
you
have
a
situation
precisely
like
that,
where
the
person
is
saying,
i'm
going
to
shoot
anybody
who
comes
in
the
house.
that's
the
officer
safety
exception.
the
informant
said
this
man
was
possibly
involved
in
drugs.
now,
what
is...
here's
a
confidential,
reliable
informant
is
saying,
he's
possibly
involved
in
drugs.
that
doesn't
sound
like--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--why
did
they
have--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no,
your
honor.
you
don't
defer
to
the
police.
we...
the
fourth
amendment
says--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
i'm
saying
that
that...
that
isn't
the
test
as
posited
by
the
government,
but
assuming
the
test
is
under
the
totality
of
circumstances...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
lost
the
train
of
your
question.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--with
due
respect--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--with
due
respect,
your
honor,
a
thousand
years
of
common
law...
a
thousand
years
of
common
law...
the
experience
of
this
country
with
the
no-knock
statute
of
1970,
which
was
repealed
in
1974,
and
that
congressional
record
is
well
worth
reading,
and
i've
tried
to
put
part
of
it
before
this
court
of
the
experience
that
came
about
from
that
court,
the
contemporary
accounts
of
tragedies,
i
suggest
says
no.
the
police
don't
always...
the
norm
is
knock
and
announce.
if
we
allow
this
kind
of
level
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
the
breaking
into
the
house,
we
are
making
the
exception
the
rule.
we
are
fundamentally
changing
the
political
relationship
between
the
state
and
the
people.
these
are
innocent
people
we
are
talking
about.
i'm
not
just
advocating...
i'm
a
lawyer
for
mr.
ramirez,
but
i'm
advocating
for
myself
and
my
family
and
for
all
of
our
families.
we
just
can't
let
the
police
say,
there's
a
danger
here,
we've
got
to
go
in
and
break
a
garage
window
at
6:15
in
the
morning,
without
giving
some
thought,
at
least
thinking
now,
wait
a
minute.
wait
a
minute.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
your
honor,
what's
reasonable...
it
wasn't
reasonable
under
these
circumstances,
based
on
the
information
they
had.
far
more
reasonable,
frankly,
would
have
been
to
do
nothing,
to
simply...
i'm
not...
i
realize
that
police
make
tactics
on
the
field,
but
they
could
telephone
in,
they
could
say
the...
remsburg,
cited
by
amicus--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--says
the
last
thing
you
do
when
there's
someone
in
the
house
with
guns--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
pardon
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes,
i
agree
with,
your
honor,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
in
determining
whether
what
they
did
was
reasonable,
it's
not...
doesn't
seem
illogical
to
look
at
some
of
the
alternatives.
i'm
not
saying
they...
now,
if
we
look
at
some
of
the
alternatives,
it...
they
seem
to
thrust
out
at
you
that
this
would
be
more
likely.
i
mean,
justice
breyer,
your
argument
before
almost
suggested
in
order
to
save
the
children
we
have
to
go
in.
this
sounds...
historically
there's
a
lot
of
instances
we
have
to
kill--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--there
are
supposed
to
be
guns--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
there
are
supposed
to
be
guns
in
the
garage.
they're
not...
guns
are
not
in
the
garage.
this
would
be
a
different
case
and
a
different
balance
might
well
have
been
struck,
but
there
are
supposed
to
be
guns
in
the
garage,
and
the
district
court
made
a
finding
of
fact
based
on
a
stipulation,
and
the
finding
was
that
there
was
no
evidence
that
mr.
shelby
was
armed
while
in
the
residence
or
that
he
presented
a
danger
to
the
45
officers.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
the
statutory
argument.
your
honors,
18
united...
oh,
this
case,
of
course,
is
a
federal
case,
so
we
are
also
controlled
by
the
federal
no-knock
statute,
18
united
states
code
section
3109,
and
if
the
court
should
decide...
actually,
the
court
doesn't
even
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
question
if
it
decides
my
way
on
the
statute.
now,
under
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
as
was
pointed
out
earlier,
no-knock...
knock
and
announce
was
required.
if
you
compare
the,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
statute
with
the
new
york
statute
that
it
was
based
on,
which
can
be
found
in,
your
honors,
at
page
44
of
my
brief...
page
44
of
my
brief,
if
you
look
at
the
statute
that
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
field
code,
you
can
see
that
the
federal
statute
tracks
verbatim
the
new
york
statute,
except
for
the
last
sentence.
now,
the
last
sentence,
we
see
congress
is
changing
the
new
york
statute.
it
adds
on
the
statement
that
officers
can
also...
another
exception
is
to
go
in
and
rescue,
or
liberate,
as
they
say,
a
person
who's
trapped
in
the
house,
so
we
have
congress,
congress
making
a
specific
decision
to
enact
specific
exceptions.
they
enacted
this
one
particular
exception
to
liberate,
which
comes
from
a
common
law
case,
i
believe
in
1619,
the
wilshire
case,
which
justice
thomas
cited
in
his
opinion
for
the
court
in
wilson.
that's
where
a
bailiff
was
trapped
in
the
house
and
the
other
bailiffs
had
to
go
in
and
rescue
him.
but
we
see,
then,
that
this
lends
support
to
the
argument
that
congress
knows
exactly
what
it's
doing.
this
is
officer
safety.
this
is
the
consideration
that
congress
is
taking
into
account.
congress
is
making
the
political
judgment.
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
these
are
difficult
judgments.
congress,
the
representatives
of
the
people,
are
making
a
judgment
here.
the
judgment
is
this:
in
general,
officer
safety,
or
apprehension,
officer
safety
is
best
assured
and
the
safety
of
the
people
is
best
assured
when
they
comply
with
the
rule
of
semayne's
case.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i
don't
see
that.
it's
true
that
the
court,
this
court
has
interpreted
the
statute
to
broaden
its
coverage.
it's
true
that
the
court
has
done
that.
other
court...
this
court
has
done
that
in
the
past
to
broaden
the
coverage
to
further
what
this
court
saw
as
the
fundamental
values
behind
the
statute,
so
the
court
did
say
that
it
also
covers
arrest
warrants
even
though
the
terms
only
say
search
warrants.
the
court
did
say
that
it
covers
the
case
of
just
walking
into
the
front
door
instead
of
breaking
in
the
front
door
in
sabbath.
but
that
was
always
a...
let
me
say
that
the
court
didn't
have
the
benefit,
maybe,
of
this
court's
understanding
of
plain
meaning
of
language.
that's
number
1,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--it
is
the
same
court.
let
me
say
that
the
law
has
evolved.
the
law
has
evolved
such
that
we
look
at
the
specific
words
in
the
statute.
we--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
of
course,
though,
in
sabbath
the
court
held...
as
pointed
out
earlier,
the
court
held
that
exclusion
is
the
remedy,
and
the
government
has
never
claimed,
has
never
argued
in
any
of
its
briefs
before
this
court,
never
raised
it,
that
exclusion
is
not
the
remedy.
they've
never
made
an
argument...
it
seems
to
me
they've
waived
any
argument.
but
sabbath
holds
that
exclusion
is
the
remedy,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
what
the
remedy
is.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
well--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
they
haven't
raised
inevitable
discovery
in
their
brief,
and
i
think
inevitable
discovery
is
going
to
do
away
with
the
knock
and
announce
rule
altogether,
because
you
can
always
say,
what's
the
point
of
having
a
knock
and
announce?
you
can
always
get
it
at
some
point
anyway.
there's
no
rule.
if
you
invoke
inevitable
discovery,
it's
gone.
the
common
law
at
the
time
of
the
framing
of
the
constitution,
which
this
court
often
looks
to
for
guidance,
does
not
contain,
as
far
as
i
can
determine,
an
exception
for
officer
safety,
that
is,
in
the
sense
of
apprehension
of
danger.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no.
he
wouldn't
announce
himself.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
because
the
statute
says
in
general
the
safety
of
the
officer
is
best
assured--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--no.
mr.
michael
r.
levine
no,
of
course
he
wouldn't--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well--
mr.
michael
r.
levine
--well,
if
that's
the
outcome,
if
that's
the
outcome
then
congress
had
better
do
some
work.
that's
my
suggestion,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that
congress
will
do
some
work,
but...
that's
all
i
can
say,
your
honors.
