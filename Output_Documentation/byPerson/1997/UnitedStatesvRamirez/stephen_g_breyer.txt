justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--3109
doesn't
forbid
anything.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
it
must...
it
says
it
came
from
the
field
code
in
new
york
in
1880,
or
something,
and
so
at
that
time
they
must
have
think...
thought
there
was
some
different
rule
of
law
that
forbids
something,
and
then
they
said,
despite
that
different
rule
of
law,
this
permits
something.
how
did
it
work?
what
were
they
thinking,
do
you
know?
you
may
not
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
that
they
believe
they
encounter.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
isn't
the
test
that
applies,
though...
is
there
some
disagreement
about
this,
that...
i'm
reading
from
richards
v.
wisconsin.
it
says,
to
justify
a
no-knock
entry
the
police
must
have
a
reasonable
suspicion
that
knocking
and
announcing
under
the
particular
circumstances
would
be
dangerous
or
futile,
or
would
inhibit
the
effective
investigation
of
the
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
that's
the
test.
we
just...
i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
what
it
is,
isn't
it?
that's
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you're
saying
we
should
overrule...
overturn
that,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
what's
the
problem?
that
is
to
say,
presumably,
as
i
read
it
so
far...
and
you're
much
more
familiar--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
you...
you
are
much
more
familiar
with
the
record
than
i
am.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
here
that
the
police
thought
that
this
person
that
they
wanted
to
arrest
was
somewhat
dangerous...
he
had
assaulted
people,
he
had
violently
escaped
before...
that
they
came
to
arrest
him
and
they
didn't
want
to
announce
themselves
because
they
thought
there's
a
person
in
the
house
whom
we
need
to
take
by
surprise
or
he
may
pick
up
a
gun
and
shoot
somebody.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
who
knows
what
he'll
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
they
had
reasonable
suspicion
that
he
was
dangerous,
so
why
isn't
that--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
end
of
it?
all
right.
yes,
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
obviously
you're
right,
that
he
has
to
present
a
danger,
i.e.,
he
might
hurt
somebody
now,
okay.
so
they
think,
here's
a
person
who's
hurt
people
in
the
past,
here
is
a
person
who's
violently
escaped
in
the
past,
here
is
a
person
who
might
have
a
gun,
and
we're
afraid
that
if
we
announce
ourselves
he's
going
to
shoot
somebody,
now.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
how
is
that
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but
they
quote--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--they
quote
on
this.
i
mean,
in
the
dissent,
judge
kozinski's
quoting
from
somewhere.
i
thought
it
was
the
record.
shelby
was
a
major
methamphetamine
manufacturer
and
has
had
access
to
large
caches
of
weapons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
that...
isn't...
obviously
at
the
bottom
you
say,
if
only
they'd
announced
this,
there
was
less
of
a
chance
of
somebody
getting
hurt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
think
if
the
way
to
stop
people
from
getting
hurt
was
to
see
if
somebody
ran
for
a
gun
the
second
that
we
go
into
the
building,
so
we
want
to
go
and
see
if
somebody's
running
for
a
gun.
so
we
have
a
difference
of
opinion
about
the
best
way
to
stop
somebody
from
getting
hurt.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
as
long
as
theirs
is
a
reasonable
way
of
going
about
it
here,
that
they
think
theirs
is
the
best
way
to
stop
somebody
from
getting
hurt,
and
they...
you
know,
on
the
basis
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--reasonable
facts
and
so
forth--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
legally
don't
we
have
to
go
along
with
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
saying
defer.
i
thought
the
ground
was
whether
they
had
a
reasonable
suspicion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
thinking
that
you
keep
saying
that
the
best
way
to
get...
keep
people
safe
was
to
announce,
but
they're
just
denying
that.
they
think
the
best
way
was
to
break
the
window
to
look
and
see
if
somebody
went
for
a
gun.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
my
problem
is,
i...
given
the
standard--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i'm
saying
i
have
no
idea,
frankly.
i
wasn't
there.
i
don't
know,
based
on
what
i've
read.
i
have
no
more
reason
to
think
that
the
police
were
careless
in
hurting
people
than
they
were
helpful
in
trying
to
hurt
people,
trying
to
prevent
them
from
helping...
you
see,
look,
the
difficult
judgment:
there
are
guns
in
the
place,
and
this
person
has
assaulted
people
previously
and
has
had
guns
previously.
i
can
understand--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
can
understand
why
a
policeman,
knowing
that,
might
think
he
ought
to
see
if
somebody's
going
to
run
for
a
gun,
and
if
i
can
understand
that
based
on
this
record,
then
it
seems
to
me
the
standard
makes
the
answer
favorable
to
the
government,
so
that's
what
i
was
asking
you
to
respond
to.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
that's
so,
if
this
statute,
although
it's
phrased
not
to
forbid
anything--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
we
read
the
statute
as
forbidding
something,
namely
that
which
it
doesn't
permit,
which
is
what
you're
doing,
3109...
you're
reading
it
as
forbidding
that
which
it
doesn't
permit.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
does
that
mean
that
then
a
police
officer
who
knows
that
if
he
announces
himself
there'll
be
a
hail
of
bullets,
he
knows
that,
that
he
would
still
have
to
announce
himself?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
why
wouldn't...
the
statute
doesn't
give
an
exception,
does
it,
for
officer
safety?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
in
your
view
if
the
policeman
knows
that
if
he
announces
himself
he
will
be
killed
instantly,
in
your--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
of
course,
it
would
be
absurd.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
so...
but
then,
that's
why
i'm
confused
about
how
the
statute's
actually
supposed
to
work.
you've
just
abandoned
your
statutory
argument,
in
other
words.
you
have
to
take
the...
well,
the
bitter
with
the
sweet.
