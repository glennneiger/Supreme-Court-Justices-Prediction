and
another
preliminary
matter.
do
you
accept
the
notion
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
impose
some
kind
of
restraints
on
the
amount
of
force
that
officers
can
use
in
effecting
a
no-knock
entry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
the
officers
were
just
clumsy
and
negligent
and
poked
a
hole
through
a
window
by
virtue
of
their
negligence,
and
it
frightened
the
homeowner
and...
should
we
apply
some
higher
standard
for
the
resulting
entry?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
richards
involved
a
forcible
entry.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
just
don't
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
is
faithful
to
that.
i
mean,
for
you
to
prevail,
i
guess
you're
right,
we'd
have
to
change
richards.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
okay,
but
also
in
the
agreed
stipulation
of
facts,
to
which
your
client
apparently
agreed,
it
said
that
other
information
from
the
government's
informant
indicated
that
the
defendant,
ramirez,
was
possibly
involved
in
drugs
which
he
kept
in
the
garage.
the
informant
also
indicated
there
were
supposed
to
be
several
guns
in
the
garage,
and
what
we
had
here
was
breaking
of
a
windowpane
in
the
garage
so
that
this...
officers
could
surveil...
conduct
surveillance
of
that
space
as
they
entered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
how
is
that...
how
does
that
fail
the
reasonability
test
required
by--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--this
court's
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
ought
to
be...
it
ought
to
be
fairly
substantial,
should
it
not,
in
light
of
the
long
tradition
of
knock
and
announce?
i
mean,
i
don't--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
don't
see
how
that
can
be
some
casual
standard
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
all
have
in
mind
what
happened
at
waco.
i
think
we
do
have
some
concerns
here.
