just
a
preliminary
question:
is
the
warrant
in
the
record?
i
couldn't
find
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
another
preliminary
question.
assume
probable
cause.
this
case
is
the
same
with
or
without
the
warrant,
is
it
not,
or
is
that
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no.
assume
that
it's
probable
cause.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
your
argument
here
would
be
the
same
if
there
were
no
warrant
but
the
police
had
probable
cause,
would
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
would...
the...
you
would
make
the
same
argument
here
whether
or
not
the
no-knock
waiver
was
in
the
warrant
or
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
if
we
say
that
reading
the
record
in
all
of
the
circumstances
here
the
entry
was
reasonable,
you
would
prevail
in
this
case.
that...
i'm
not
sure
that
that
would
answer
the
question
you
wanted
answered,
or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
that
be
a
perfectly
satisfactory
disposition,
or
would
it
still
leave
the
twotier
rule
in
effect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
in
the
course
of
saying
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
we
will
still...
we
would
still
say,
if
we
agreed
with
you,
that
the
ultimate
standard
is
reasonableness,
that
the...
you
cannot
destroy
more
property
than
is
reasonably
necessary,
given
all
of
the
circumstances
and
given
the
necessity
to
protect
your
officers.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
i
suppose
that
if
the
door
had
been
unlocked
here
and
they
just
burst
through
the
door
and
everything
else
was
the
same,
the
fear
of
the
occupants
would
have
been
precisely
the
same.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
unless
you
disagree
with
my
suggestion
in
my
hypothetical,
all
we're
talking
about
here
is
a
broken
windowpane.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
same
danger
would
have
been
applied
if
they'd
burst
through
the
door,
assuming
the
door's
unlocked,
or
they
had
a
pass
key...
they
have
a
pass
key.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
just
don't
think
there's
any
empirical
evidence
for
that.
i
just
find
it
very
difficult
to
write
an
opinion
based
on
that
assumption.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
haven't
heard
you
make
one
argument
that
wouldn't
apply
equally
to
the
application
for
the
no-knock
warrant
in
and
of
itself.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
to
me
is
that
the
officers
should
have
knocked
and
announced.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
so--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
have
to
take
this
case
on
the
premise
that
a
knock
and
announce
was
not
required.
that's
because
there
were
some
exigent
circumstances,
some
indications
of
danger.
now,
you
want
us
to
parse
this
and
say,
well,
there
are
two
levels.
you
want
us--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--you
don't
agree
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--would
you
agree
with
this
statement
in
becker:
to
justify
what
the
ninth
circuit
case--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
preceded
mcconney.
to
justify
physical
destruction
of
property,
more
specific
inferences
of
exigency
are
necessary.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
if
property
damage
does
not
have
to
affect
probable
cause,
does
it
affect
the
exigent
circumstances
that
are
necessary
for
the
extraordinary
means
of
entry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
how
that's
so
different
from
what
the
ninth
circuit
said.
