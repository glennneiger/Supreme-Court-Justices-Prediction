mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
concerns
whether
police
officers
must
have
a
higher
justification
than
reasonable
suspicion
if
they
damage
property
while
making
a
no-knock
entry
to
execute
a
search
warrant.
the
officers
here
sought
to
apprehend
an
escaped
convict
who
had
committed
numerous
violent
acts
and
had
stated
that
he
would
never
return
to
prison.
while
executing
a
no-knock
entry
at
respondent's
house
to
execute
a
search
warrant
to
look
for
that
fugitive,
the
officers
broke
a
single
garage
door
windowpane.
based
on
that
property
damage,
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
the
officers
must
have
a
higher
justification
for
foregoing
with
the
general
principle
of
knock
and
announcement.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
the
warrant
itself
is
lodged
by
respondent
in
the
brief
in
opposition.
there
was
a
lodging
made
by
respondent.
it's
at
lodging
number
f.--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--and
it
is
lodged
with
the
clerk.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
justice
o'connor.
the
two
questions
are
distinct,
in
our
view.
if
the
officers
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
forego
knocking
and
announcing,
they
may
use
the
force
reasonably
necessary
to
effectuate
the
entry.
a
case
of
excessive
or
wholly
needless
property
damage
would
be
assessed
under
a
reasonableness
standard
that
took
into
account
whether
or
not
it
was
actually
reasonable
to
go
through
the
door
or
to
go
through
the
window,
or
to
engage
in
some
other
property
damage.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
with
or
without
probable
cause
to
make--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
to
conduct
the
search
or--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--our
answer
is
the
same
with
respect
to
the
no-knock
clause
of
the
warrant,
justice
kennedy,
if
that
is
what
your
question
is
getting
at.
the
officers
here
had
probable
cause
to
search
the
premises.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
the
magistrate
put
a
no-knock
provision
in
the
warrant.
our
view
is
that
when
the
officers
executed
the
entry,
they
had
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
they
would
face
danger
if
they
knocked
and
announced,
so
if
i
understand--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
yes.
as
the
court
made
clear
in
richards,
the
question
is
whether
the
officers'
reasonable
suspicion
at
the
time
they
make
the
entry.
there
may
be
circumstances
that
dissipate
that
reasonable
suspicion
if
the
officers
have
gone
to
the
magistrate,
the
magistrate
authorizes
a
no-knock
entry,
and
what
the
court
made
clear
in
richards
is
that
if
those
circumstances
dissipate
the
reasonable
suspicion,
it
would
not
be
reasonable
for
the
officers
to
forego
knocking
and
announcing,
notwithstanding
that
the
warrant
contained
a
no-knock
clause.
as
the
court
made
clear
in
richards,
reasonable
suspicion
is
the
standard
by
which
to
judge
foregoing
with
knocking
and
announcing.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
think
your
question
poses
two
distinct
points,
and
let
me
address
them
separately,
if
i
may.
the
reasonableness
of
the
method
of
making
the
entry
would
be
assessed
by
looking
at
what
force
was
necessary
to
get
in
quickly.
the
remedy
that
might
occur
if
the
officers
engaged
in
excessive
property
damage,
we
submit,
would
be
compensation
for
the
damaged
property
and
not
necessarily
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence,
for
if
the
officers
had
properly
made
a
no-knock
entry
supported
by
reasonable
suspicion
but
not
engaged
in
the
unnecessary
property
damage,
they
still
would
have
found
the
same
evidence,
and
they
would
have
found
the
same
evidence
at
the
same
time,
so
the
remedy
that
would
be
appropriate
in
the
case
of
needless
property
damage
would
be
compensation
and
not
the
imposition
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
justice--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
justice
stevens.
in
fact,
the
statute
that
you
may
be
referring
to
is
31
u.s.c.
3724
provides...
congress
has
provided
that
where
a
law
enforcement
activity
has
resulted
in
property
damage
to
an
innocent
third
party,
the
attorney
general
can
pay
compensation
for
that
law
enforcement
activity.
that
would
not
necessarily
be
the
case
for
a
criminal
wrongdoer.
there
would
not
be
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
government
to
pay
for
property
damage
that
occurred
for
a
wrongdoer,
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct.
i
mean,
the
officers
are
always
operating
on
the
information
that
they
have
when
they
make
the
entry.
the
question,
you
know,
to
be
clear,
is
that
if
the
officers
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
there
would
be
a
danger
if
they
knocked
and
announced,
that
carries
with
it
the
authority
to
make
whatever
property
damage
is
reasonably
necessary
to
effectuate
that
entry.
the
case
that
justice
ginsburg
posits
is
where
the
officers
have
engaged
in
wholly
needless
property
damage
that's
unrelated
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--they
broke
a
single
garage
door
windowpane,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
they
did
so
because
they
had
information
from
a
confidential,
reliable
informant
that
guns
were
kept
in
the
garage,
or
that
they
might
be
kept
in
the
garage,
and
the
purpose
of
making
that
break
in
the
garage
door
windowpane
was
so
that
an
officer
could
secure
the
garage
in
the
event
that
the
people
in
the
house
went
to
the
garage
to
get
the
guns.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
it
would
be,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
for
40
years
this
court,
starting
in
miller
v.
united
states
in
1958,
has
read
the
language
of
3109
which
we
have
set
forth
in
our
opening
brief
at
page
2,
to
essentially
codify
the
common
law
rule
of
knock
and
announcement
and
its
exceptions.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
our
view,
justice
scalia,
is
that
the
court
has
never
construed
the
terms
of
this
statute
literally.
it
read
into--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--absolutely.
that's
correct,
and
if
you
were
to
start...
if
you
were
to
start
reading
this
language
literally,
there
are
several
decisions
that
would
have
to
overruled.
miller
v.
united
states
read
into
this
a
requirement
that
knock
and
announce
be
done
for
arrest
warrants.
it
read
into
the
statute
an
exclusionary
rule.
in
sabbath
this
court
read
into
the
statute
a
requirement
that
not...
force
did
not
have
to
be
used,
notwithstanding
that
it
says,
may
break
open,
so
the
court
has
read
this
language
and
has
stated
several
times
that
the
language
is
to
be
understood
against
the
backdrop
of
principles
of
common
law
that
have
been
in
effect
for
hundreds
of
years,
and
that
the
language
is
not
to
be
read
literally,
and
our
view
is
that
there's
no
reason
at
this
point
to
go
back
to
a
literal,
textual
reading
of
section
3109
when
the
court
has
never--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
the
language
is
an
expression
of
congressional
policy
that
federal
officers
should
conduct
their
entries
by
using
the
general
principle
of
knock
and
announcement
unless
there
are
reasons
that
would
just...
be
justified
in
not
doing
so.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i
understand,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
i
think,
justice
ginsburg,
the
answer
to
your
question
is
that...
first,
our
position
is
that
the
statute
is
coextensive
with
the
fourth
amendment
requirements,
so
that
the
requirements
on
federal
law
enforcement
officers
are
no
greater
or
lesser
than
they
are
on
state
officers
as
prescribed
under
the
fourth
amendment's
reasonableness
provision.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
true.
as
a
matter
of
history,
the
language
in
the
statute
came
well
before
the
supreme
court
began
to
interpret
the
fourth
amendment's
reasonableness
requirement
to
impose
a
knock
and
announce
requirement
constitutionally,
so
as
a
matter
of
history
there
is
a
reason
for
section
3109.
it's
just
that
as
it
has
been
construed
by
this
court,
the
statute
itself
does
not
impose
a
higher
requirement
on
federal
officers
than
it
would
on
state
officers,
who
are
in
the
dangerous
situation
of
executing
warrants.
in
fact,
all
federal
courts
of
appeals,
including
the
ninth
circuit,
have
recognized
an
exception
for
officer
safety
under
section
3109,
notwithstanding
that
the
textual
language
does
not
contain
such
an
exception.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand
the
question.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
would
certainly
be
our
view
if
the
court
were
not
to
accept
its
prior
cases,
which
hold
that
the
common
law
rule
of
knock
and
announcement
has
been,
in
effect,
codified
by
section
3109.
i'd
like
to
emphasize
two
other
points.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
i...
yes,
i...
although
i'm...
i
actually
don't
recall,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
as
this
court
noted
in--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
and
in
sabbath
itself
the
court
read
the
words
forcibly
break
essentially
out
of
this
statute,
because
the
facts
there
were
that
the
officer
entered
an
unlocked
door.
i
would
like
to
underscore
that
the
ninth
circuit's
teaching--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--in
any
event,
if
this
court
were
to
do
something
with
3109
it
would
have
to
encounter
its
prior
decisions
in
miller
and
in
sabbath
with
respect
to
questions
such
as
whether
it
goes
beyond
the
common
law
in
terms
of
restricting
this--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--with
respect
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
as
the
law
of
knock
and
announce
developed,
it
developed
in
the
law
of
civil
trespass
where
property
owners
brought
trespass
actions
against
law
enforcement
officers
for
unlawfully
entering
premises.
now,
the
legislative
history,
even
into
the
new
york
statute,
is
not
clear
as
to
why
the
new
york
drafters
of
their
statutes
put
it
into
the
law,
but
one
theory
might
be
that
the...
new
york
and
in
congress
wanted
to
create
an
affirmative
grant
of
authority
to
officers
so
that
they
could
avoid
trespass
actions.
but
that's
just
speculation
on
our
part,
because
there
is...
the
historical
evidence
simply
is
not
clear
as
to
why
certain
aspects
of
the
common
law
of
knock
and
announcement
were
specifically
written
into
3109
and
others
that
had
been
well-recognized,
including
officer
safety,
from
the
1822
decision
of
reed
v.
case,
were
not,
so
i
think
that
it
would
be
pure
speculation
as
to
exactly
why
an
affirmative
grant
was
placed
into
the
statutory
provisions,
justice
breyer.
let
me
point
out
that
the
ninth
circuit's
twotier
rule
places
an
unreasonable
burden
on
law
enforcement
officers.
no-knock
entries
routinely
involve
some
damage
to
property.
in
the
richards
case,
for
instance,
the
officers
had
to
ram
the
door
and
kick
it
in
in
order
to
make
the
entry.
if
officers
need
more
than
reasonable
suspicion
to
justify
a
no-knock
entry
involving
property
damage,
they
may
have
to
face
the
choices
of
having
evidence
suppressed
at
trial
or
facing
greater
personal
risks
when
knocking
and
announcement.
we
submit
that
the
officer
should
not
be
forced
to
make
that
kind
of
calculus
at
a
dangerous
situation
such
as
executing
warrants.
moreover,
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
provides
no
practical
guidance
to
officers.
warrant
execution
entails
high
risks
and
requires
split-second
judgments.
it
is
unclear
what
level
of
information
will
meet
the
higher
tier
of
specificity
required
by
the
ninth
circuit.
the
level
of
justification
for
a
no-knock
entry
should
not
turn
on
the
fortuity
of
the
officers
encountering
an
unlocked
door
or
window.
reasonable,
just
suspicion
justifies
the
property
damage
that
is
reasonably
necessary
to
effectuate
that
entry
and,
in
fact,
if
the
ninth
circuit's
rule
is
accepted
by
this
court
that
something
more
than
reasonable
suspicion
is
necessary
if
property
damage
is
the
result
of
the
no-knock
entry,
that
will,
in
effect,
swallow
the
rule
that
this
court
announced
in
richards.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--i
think
it...
it
would
not
be
clear
to
the
courts
below
exactly
what
this
court
was
saying
with
respect
to
that
question,
justice
kennedy,
and
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
for
the
express
purpose
of
having
this
court
say
that
the
two-tier
rule
was
not
the
rule
that
should
govern
in
cases
of
property
damage.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
justice
kennedy,
but
i
hope
that,
when
you
do
write
that
opinion
saying
that,
you
distinguish
between
the
reasons
that
the
officers
have
for
foregoing
with
knocking
and
announcement
and
the
reasons
that
they
have
for
the
particular
method
of
getting
into
the
premises.
a
fortified
door
that
is
barricaded,
has
steel
reinforcements,
will
require
a
different
tactical
method
than
a
door
that
is
a
screen
door,
that
may
be
wide
open.
our
view
is
that
reasonable
suspicion
justifies
getting
the
officers
inside
the
premises
as
quickly
as
possible.
how
they
go
about
doing
that,
though,
is
going
to
turn
on
the
reasonableness
of
the
fortifications
that
they
encounter
when
they
execute
the
search
warrant.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct,
that
are
objectively
reasonable
based
on
the
circumstances.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no,
i
do
not
mean
that
the
fortifications
themselves
were
reasonable,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
that
the
officers
need
to--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--exactly.
it
should
not
be
the
rule
that
if
people
engaged
in
criminal
conduct
use
some
of
the
fruits
of
their
activity
to
fortify
their
homes,
which
would
there...
or
premises,
and
thereby
lead
to
greater
property
destruction
if
officers
have
reasonable
suspicion
to
make
a
no-knock
entry,
should
entitle
them
to
greater
fourth
amendment
protection
than
people
who
do
not
engage
in
such
fortifications.
what...
and
our
view
is
that
those
two
questions
should
be
decoupled
so
that
it
is
clear
to
all
that
officers
may
dispense
with
knocking
and
announcement
if
they
have
reasonable
suspicion.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions
at
this
time,
i'd
like
to
save
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
would
like
this
court
to
say
that
reasonable
suspicion
justifies
a
reasonable
entry
into
the
dwelling
even
if
that
involves
some
property
damage,
and
if--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
let
me
explain
why.
if
the
wall
is
barricaded
and
a
person
has
put
fortifications
up
so
that
a
reasonable
means
of
entry
entails
taking
the
wall
out,
that
would
be
judged
separately
from
the
justifications
that
the
officers
have
for
fearing
their
safety.
that's...
the
court
has
long
held
that
the
manner
of
the
search
can
be
treated
distinct
from
the
justifications
that
the
officers
have
for
getting
probable
cause
for
a
warrant,
for
example.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
those
would
be
the
circumstances
as
to
how
the
officers
tactically
needed
to
make
the
decision
to
get
into
the
dwelling,
but
there
should
not
be
a
sliding
scale
or
a
higher
tier
if
the
officers
face
fortifications
but
the
person
is
of
the
same
dangerousness
as
alan
shelby
was
in
this
case.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
they
have
probable
cause--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
two
points.
number
1,
two
federal
agents
had
identified
shelby
at
the
respondent's
home,
and
they
have
confidence
in
the
reliable
informant,
and
second--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--it's--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--my--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes.
the
remedy,
justice
scalia,
is
to
put
your
wall
back
up,
or
to
repair
your
wall,
not
to
require--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--not
to
require
officers
to
have
proof
to
a
near
certainty,
or
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
you
or
someone
in
your
home
poses
a
danger
to
officers
if
they
knock
and
announce
their
presence.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
we
would
suggest
that
the
use
of
the
term,
exigent
circumstances,
creates
and
has
created
problems,
and
so
we
would
suggest
a
different
analytical
formulation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
what
we
would
suggest
is
that
the
means
of
entry
be
analyzed
separately
so
that
if
the
officers
have
information
that
they
are
facing
barricades
or
that
one
particular
part
of
the
dwelling
is
fortified
but
another
part
is
not,
that
that
would
be
the
reasonable
circumstance
that
should
be--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--what
the
ninth
circuit
held
was
that
the
officers
needed
to
have
higher
evidence
of
the
danger
to
themselves.
a
person
can
live
behind
a
fortified
dwelling
and
not
pose
any
threat
to
anybody.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
justice
scalia.
if
the
officers
have
reason
to
believe
that
if
they
knock
and
announce
they
are
going
to
face
danger,
the
fact
that
the
persons
inside
who
posed
that
danger
to
them,
have
put
fortifications
up
that
require
more
property
damage,
should
not
entitle
them
to
higher
fourth
amendment
protection.
the
officers,
if
they
have
a
reasonable
suspicion,
should
be
able
to
take
the
means
reasonably
necessary
to
make
the
entry
even
if
that
damages
a
lot
of
property
if
the
property
is...
if
that
means
is
reasonably
calibrated
to
the
need
to
get
inside.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
and
justice
scalia,
we're
wrestling
with
that
question
right
now
in
the
lower
federal
courts
as
to
whether
a
reasonable
suspicion
to
forego
knocking
and
announcing...
you
know,
what
exactly
that
consists
of.
it
certainly
is
different
than
a
terry
pat-down
frisk.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
is
not,
justice
o'connor,
and
that
is
why
our
office
has
struggled
with--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no,
and
we
share
those
concerns,
justice
o'connor.
it's
just
that
the
standard
should
not
be
a
fluid
one.
it
should
be
one
reasonable
suspicion
standard,
however
that
comes
to
be
defined
by
the
courts
as
they
struggle
with
those
instances
when
the
officers
need
to
invoke
the
exception
to
the
general
rule
of
knock
and
announcement,
and
that
will
evolve
as
courts
wrestle
with
this.
