justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
frederick,
i
am
less
concerned
about...
well,
just
as
concerned,
i
suppose,
but
i
am
less
troubled
by
what
the
fourth
amendment
might
provide
than
i
am
by
section
3109,
which
says
the
officer
may
break
open
any
outer
or
inner
door
or
window
or
any
part
of
the
house,
or
anything
therein,
to
execute
a
search
warrant
if,
after
notice
of
his
authority
and
purpose,
he
is
refused
admittance,
which
didn't
occur
here,
or
when
necessary
to
liberate
himself
or
a
person
aiding
him
in
the
execution
of
the
warrant,
which
didn't
occur
here.
i
don't
see
what
the
purpose
of
that
statute
is
unless
it
is
meant
to
exclude
other
break-ins,
which
isn't
to
say
that
the
other
break-ins
would
exclude
all
the
evidence
that's
found,
and
i
assume
that
your
answer
to
what
would
happen
if
there's
a
violation
of
3109
is
the
same
thing
as
your
answer
to
what
happens
if
you
use
excessive
force,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
exclusionary
rule
would
not
apply,
but
you'd
be
liable
for
whatever
damage
you've
caused.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
why
shouldn't
i
read
3109
that
way,
saying
these
are
the
only...
these
are
the
only
reasons
why
a
federal
officer
can
break
anything
in
a
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it...
but
it
clearly
doesn't,
unless
you're
wrong
about
what
the
common
law
allows.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
we've
never
construed
it
to
mean
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
effect
does
3109
have
if
we
do
that?
is
it
just
a
superfluous
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
just
sort
of
there
to
say,
you
don't
really
mean
just
this,
do
whatever
you
like?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
whether
you
have
to
pay
for
the
window
or
the
door.
i
mean,
you're
not
talking
about
letting
the
culprit
skip
away
under
the
exclusionary
rule
if
this
provision
has
been
violated.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
provision...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
such
a
massive
importance
in
interpreting
3109
so
broadly,
because
if
it
has
been
violated,
the
only
consequence
is
that
the
window
has
to
be
paid
for,
or
the
door
that's
broken
down
has
to
be
paid
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
wasn't
a
holding
of
the
case,
of
course.
that
wasn't
a
holding
of
the
case.
it
was
just
an
assumption
which
never
had
to
be
applied.
oh,
i
don't
think
that
they
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
this...
you
know,
the
first
paragraph--
--they
didn't
exclude
the
evidence--
--they
said
in
the
first
paragraph
the
evidence
will
have
to
be
excluded.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
want
us
to
read
the
statute
literally,
that
is
what
it
says.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
fine,
but
that...
does
mere
reasonable
suspicion
and
not
a
higher
degree
of
suspicion
become
necessary
if
you're
going
to
do
substantial
property
damage?
i
mean,
let's
say
the
only
way
to
get
in
without
knocking
and
announcing
is
to
blow
up
one
side
of
the
house.
now,
i
can
understand
that...
you
do
it,
if
it's
a
serial
murderer
in
there
and
you've
been
looking
for
him
for
10
years,
there's
no
other
way
to
get
him,
and
you're
very
sure
he's
there.
but
do
you
mean
if
it's
just
ordi...
the
same
reasonable
suspicion
that
would
justify
breaking
the
window
would
justify
taking
out
the
whole
side
of
the
house?
justice
antonin
scalia
wow.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
sure,
what
manner
you
use
depends
on
those
other
factors,
how
sure
you
are
the
guy
is
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
not
as
sure
that
he's
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
maybe
he's
staying
at
scalia's
house.
i
don't
mind
they're
taking
away
one
of
my
walls
if
they
think
they're
going
after,
you
know,
jack
the
ripper,
but
if
they're
really
not
sure
he's
there,
i
would
like
that
wall
of
my
house
to
still
be
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
quarreling
with
you...
i'm
not
quarreling
with
you
on
the
facts
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
judge
kozinski.
but
to
set
forth
a
rule
that
you
don't,
you
know,
property
damage--
--there
is
no...
you
wouldn't
do
that.
--does
not
take--
justice
antonin
scalia
--does
not
affect
the
degree...
you
want
us
to
say
the
property
damage
does
not
affect
the
degree
of
probable
cause
that
you
need?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
the
same
degree
of
certainty
that
this
criminal
is
in
there,
only
the
same
degree...
20
percent
chance
he's
in
there...
you
need
that
to
break
a
little
window,
and
you
also
need
that,
and
no
more
than
that,
to
take
out
a
wall.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
get
me
to
adopt
that
rule
i
may
well
up
my
interpretation
of
what
a
reasonable
suspicion
consists
of.
if
i
know
that
the
consequence
of
a
reasonable
suspicion
is
i'm
going
to
lose
the
side
of
my
house,
i
might
well
require
your
agents
to
be
a
lot
more
sure
than
i
otherwise
would.
