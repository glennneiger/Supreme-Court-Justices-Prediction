am
i
correct
in
understanding
you're
explaining
why
res
judicata
won't
bar
your
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
any
issue
except
whether
there's
estoppel
here?
i'm
just
a
little
puzzled
why
we
have
to
get
into
the
facts
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
point,
as
i
understand
your
brief,
is
that
even
a
narrow
res
judicata
exception
should
not
be
recognized.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
just
saying
this
is
the
parade
of
horribles.
if
we
take
the
first
step,
we
go
down
the
slippery
slope.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
we
were
to
say
it
stops
with
the
first
cases
in
which
the
answer
turns
on
an
interpretation
of
a
federal
order,
which
here
i
guess
one
could...
part
of
your
argument
would
be
the
scope
of
the
bankruptcy's
court's
order,
just
what
it
means,
and
maybe
you...
maybe
we
could
say
that's
the
scope
of
the
doctrine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
this
one
other
question.
do
you...
is
the
res
judicata
issue
a
matter
of
federal
law
or
state
law,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
federal.
you
think
it's
federal.
