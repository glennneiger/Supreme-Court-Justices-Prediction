chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1971,
mary
anna
rivet
v.
the
regions
bank
of
louisiana.
mr.
odom.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
do
with
the
footnote
in
our
moitie
case,
mr.
odom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
odom.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stern,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
stern,
it
was
your
client
who
removed
the
action,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
in
order
to
remove
it,
you
have
to
comply
with
1441(b),
is
that
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
any
civil
action
in
which
the
district
courts
have
original
jurisdiction,
and
how
do
you
phrase
your
argument
that
a
district
court
would
have
had
original
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
does
that
make
it
a
civil
action
in
which
the
district
court
would
have
had
original
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
this
was
filed
in
state
court,
wasn't
it?
it
seems
extraordinarily
unlikely
that
they
would
file
what
was
really
a
60(b)
motion
appended
to
an
earlier
federal
action
and
file
that
in
the
state
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
you're
expanding
the
artful
pleading
doctrine
a
good
ways
with
your
submission.
the
artful
pleading
doctrine,
as
i
had
understood
it,
was
that
you
cannot
by
artful
pleading
avoid
the
possibility
of
removal,
but
i
don't
think
it's
ever
been
construed
quite
as
broadly
as
you
construe
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
saying
that
any
time
a
plaintiff
in
state
court,
perhaps
without
legal
justification,
files
an
action
which
would
require
the
state
court
to
review
some
previous
proceeding
in
federal
court,
that
that
is
automatically
removable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
every
single
statement
in
a
supreme
court
opinion
isn't
a
pearl,
so
to
speak.
[laughter]
and
i
mean,
i
think
if
you
find
something
in
a
footnote
that
is
rather
vague,
you
expand
on
it
or
put
great
weight
on
it
kind
of
at
your
peril.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
celotex
v.
edwards
didn't
involve
removal,
as
i
recall.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
said
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
bankruptcy
court.
and
it
may
be
that
your
defense
would
prevail
on
the
merits,
but
that's
a
question
that
the
state
courts
are
entitled
to
decide
in
the
first
instance
and
it
could
be
reviewed
here
if
you
think
they
decided
wrongly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
a
res...
that's
res
judicata
law,
but
the
kind
of
law
we're
dealing
with
here
is
removal
law,
which
is
based,
as
we
say,
on
1441(b)
and
the
well
pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stern.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
odom,
you
have
6
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
odom.
the
case
is
submitted.
