justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
that
the
same
thing
with
federal
antitrust
law
and
state
valentine
acts?
the
state
antitrust
laws
remain
in
effect.
they're
not
totally
preempted
by
the
federal
antitrust
law,
are
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
then,
how
do
you
explain
the
consequence
in
moitie?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
outcome.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let
me
give
you
a
very
narrow
way
to
interpret
moitie.
the
court
had
a
substantive
issue
it
took
the
case
to
reach
and
the
parties...
one
of
the
parties
brought
up
the
problem
that
this...
maybe
this
stuff
doesn't
belong
in
federal
court
anyway,
so
there's
no
jurisdiction
and
you
can't
reach
the
substantive
argument
and
the
court
goes
through
this
footnote,
the
conclusion
of
which
footnote
is,
we
will
not
question
here
that
factual
finding.
it
seems
to
me
the
court
is
simply
saying,
we
accept
the
determination
of
the
district
court
which
we
take
as
a
factual
determination.
i
don't
know
that
the
court
itself
endorsed
it.
it
said,
we
will
not
question
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
ah,
but
we
have
a
lot
of
jurisdiction
that
says...
a
lot
of
jurisprudence
that
says,
where
question
of
jurisdiction
is
just
accepted
or
assumed
by
the
court
and
not
considered
and
ruled
on,
it
won't
be
considered
precedential--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i
don't
know
that
this
isn't
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
will
not
question
here
that
factual
finding,
is
the
bottom
line.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you're
right
about
that
and
that
artful
pleading
consists
of
bringing
a
cause
of
action
to
which
there
is
a
defense
that
a
federal...
a
prior
federal
case
gives
a
res
judicata
defense,
then
what
would
follow
is
not
only
you
can
remove
it,
but
that
state
law
claim
to
which
there
is
a
possible
federal
res
judicata
defense
can
be
brought
originally
in
federal
court,
so
any
state
law
claim,
you
know,
how
clear
does
the
federal
bankruptcy
defense
or
the
other
federal
res
judicata
defense
have
to
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
agree
with
you,
if
this
were
a
case
like
moitie
where
this
question
was
just
an
obstacle
to
our
reaching
the
issue
for
which
we
took
the
case,
we
could
get
rid
of
it
with
a
footnote
that
said
we're
not
inclined
to
question
the,
you
know,
the
district
court's
factual
finding
on
this
inconvenient
jurisdictional
question
that's
been
raised.
unfortunately,
we
took
this
case
for
the
jurisdictional
question.
it's
hard
to
write
a
footnote
like
that.
[laughter]
there
couldn't
be
any
text
to
which
the
footnote
would
attach
itself.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
stern,
could
i
ask
you
about
moitie
again?
why
can't
you
explain
the
moitie
footnote...
and
i
think
this
is
somewhat
the
way
the
petitioner
characterized
it.
the
moitie
footnote
doesn't
say
anything
about
res
judicata
nor,
for
that
matter,
does
justice
brennan's
dissent,
to
which
you
say
the
footnote
must
have
been
directed.
i
don't
believe
he
mentions
res
judicata
even
in
the
dissent,
so
we
don't
really
know
that
the
reason
the
court
is
saying
that
this
is
an
artful
recasting
of
essential
federal
law
claims
was
because
of
the
res
judicata
defense.
you're
just
assuming
that.
it
may
well
be
that
the
court
was
just
saying,
look,
it
was
the
same
complaint
filed.
we
just
crossed
off
antitrust
and
put
in
valentine
act,
or
whatever
the
name
of
the
california
law
was.
i
really
think
that
that's
a
more
plausible
reading
of
the
footnote.
now,
maybe
that...
whether
that
was
right
or
wrong,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
case,
whether
crossing
off
antitrust
and
putting
in
the
name
of
a
similar
state...
that's
what
brennan
was
addressing
in
his
dissent.
he
said,
there
are
state
antitrust
causes
of
action
as
well
as
federal
and
if
you
bring
them,
it's
not
a
federal
claim.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is
a
collateral
attack.
justice
antonin
scalia
--no
acceleration
for
insolvency?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
balloon
payment
with
no--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
wrote
that?
[laughter]
