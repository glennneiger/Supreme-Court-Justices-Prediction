mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
plaintiffs,
in
the
guise
of
a
state
court
foreclosure
action,
have
launched
a
collateral
attack
on
a
prior
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court,
in
this
case
the
bankruptcy
court
sitting
in
the
eastern
district
of
louisiana.
i'd
like
to
take
issue
initially
with
a
couple
of
comments
that
mr.
odom
made
concerning
the
import
of
the
order
and
its
application
under
state
law.
what's
not
at
issue
is
what
the
order
says.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
we're
arguing
about
does
the
order
say
x
or
does
the
order
say
y.
the
order
clearly
states
that
a
sale
is
going
to
be
made
under
the
auspices
of
the
bankruptcy
court
free
and
clear
of
all
liens,
mortgages,
claims,
et
cetera,
and
the
mortgage
that
the
petitioners
seek
to
foreclose
on
is
specifically
listed
in
the
order.
there's
no
question
about
that,
and
what
petitioners
are
seeking
to
do
is
attack
the
validity
of
the
order.
if
you
read
their
brief,
i
believe
perhaps
the
clearest
indication
is
on
page
48
of
the
brief.
they
want
to
attack
the
validity
of
the
order
in
terms
of,
were
the
proper
parties
there,
was
the
proper
notice
given,
was
the
proper
procedure
used.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
no
question.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well,
the...
that
goes
back
to
the
question
of
how
the
artful
pleading
doctrine
works
in
the
first
place.
it
requires
some
recharacterization.
i
believe
justice
breyer's
question
dealing
with
moitie
points
that
out.
on
its
face,
moitie
had
only
state
causes
of
action.
the
argument
here...
in
that
instance
the
recharacterization
was
that
there
was
a
federal
cause
of
action
stated,
although
in
disguise.
our
position
here
is
that
the
petitioners
are
in
effect
taking
either
an
out
of
time
appeal
from
the
bankruptcy
court
order,
or
you
could
interpret
what
they're
as
a
rule
9024
motion,
essentially
a
rule
60
motion.
they
are
seeking
to
attack
the
bankruptcy
court
order.
the
fifth
circuit
saw
the
case
that
way
and
made
specific
reference
in
several
points
during
its
opinion
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
collateral
attack.
this
is,
in
disguise,
an
attempt
to
retry
the
bankruptcy
case.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well,
if
it's
either
an
appeal
or
a
rule
60
motion
the
original
court
would
have
had...
the
district
court
would
have
had
original
jurisdiction,
essentially
ancillary
to
the
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
that
it
had
in
the
first
place.
if
you
file
a
rule
60
or
a
rule
9024
motion
in
federal
court
you
don't
need
an
independent
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well,
but
that's
the
whole
point
of
the
artful
pleading
doctrine,
is
that
you
try
to
disguise
what
is,
in
effect,
a
federal
claim.
if
you
look
at
what
they
say
the
state
court
should
have
reviewed,
what
the
state
court
has
to
do
is
essentially
sit
in
review
on
what
the
bankruptcy
court
did.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well,
the...
i
would
agree
that
the
procedural
context
here
makes
it
unique,
but
it's
a
procedural
context
that
occurs
over
and
over
in
bankruptcy.
one
of
the
things
that
makes
this
case
a
little
bit
different
from
moitie
on
the
surface
but
not,
i
believe,
once
you
look
underneath
it,
is
the
fact
that
in
bankruptcy
typically
a
creditor
comes
in
objecting
to
something
that's
going
to
happen
and
what
they're
seeking
to
do
is
have
a
state
court
sit
in
review
of
the
propriety
of
the
order
issued
by
the
court
simply
by
saying
i'm
going
to
foreclose
on
a
mortgage
that
this
order
says
no
longer
exists.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
there
are
two
or
three
different
arguments
that
we've
made.
one
of
the
arguments
would
suggest
that.
the
argument
that
speaks
to
the
question
of
merger
and
bar
and
how
you
characterize
a
state
court
action
that
is
precluded
by
a
prior
federal
judgment
i
think
would
lead
to
that
result,
but
i
think
there
are
narrower
ways
that
you
can
interpret
moitie
if
you
so
choose
and
mr.
odom--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--whether
the
court
was
endorsing
the
finding,
so
to
speak,
your
honor,
i
think,
though,
to
some
extent
begs
the
question,
because
the
court
had
to
consider
whether
the
case
was
properly
before
it
in
the
first
place
and--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well,
with
all
due
respect,
first
of
all
the
jurisdictional
issue
was
clearly
brought
to
the
court's
attention,
because
there
is
a
dissent
by
justice
brennan,
90
percent
of
which
is
devoted
to
the
jurisdictional
issues,
and
footnote
2
makes
clear
that
the
court
is
considering
the
issue.
secondly,
there
is
the
question
of
what
factual
finding
means
in
that
context.
it's
not
a
factual
finding
that
a
jury
could
make.
this
isn't
the
kind
of
issue
that's
going
to
go
to
the
jury.
it's
essentially
a
legal
characterization
of
a
claim.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
sufficient
to
this
extent.
what
it
would
be
saying
is
that
district
courts
have
the
authority
to
recharacterize
claims
if
they
believe
that
despite
what...
despite
the
characterization
that
the
plaintiffs
give
to
a
claim
it
is,
in
fact,
something
else.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well,
i
recognize
i'm
speaking
to
the
author
of
that
footnote,
so--
[laughter]
there
is
a
danger
in
reading
too
much
into
moitie,
into
the
footnote,
but
i
think
at
a
minimum
what
it
stands
for
is
recognition
by
the
court
that
there
is
such
a
thing
as
artful
pleading.
i
mean,
that
much,
it
seems
to
me,
is
clear
from
the
footnote
and,
secondly,
that
the
doctrine
of
artful
pleading
is
going
to
expand
to
some
extent
beyond
the
preemption
cases.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
let
me
suggest
that
in
this
case,
if
you
want
to
view
moitie
at
its
narrowest...
and
let's
take
your
construction
of
moitie,
justice
scalia.
there's
a
factual
finding
that,
despite
what
someone
purports
to
say,
it
in
fact
is
really
something
else.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
and
the
court
on
review
doesn't
need
to
disturb
that.
that's
what
we
have
here.
i
mean,
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
fifth
circuit--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--the
joint
appendix,
page
81,
and
let
me
just
read
one
sentence
and
then
perhaps
we
can
get
to
the
core
issue
that
you're
speaking
to.
it
says,
despite
its
intentionally
deceitful
garb,
the
core
issue
of
the
miranne
subsequent
state
court
complaint
was
the
efficacy
of
the
final
executory
nonappealable
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court
that
had
freed
the
leased
premises
from,
inter
alia,
the
mirannes'
second
mortgage.
now--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--is
that
why
he's
coming
back?
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
yes.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well,
the
rule
as
it
had
been
stated
in
the
fifth
circuit
was
clear,
and
there
was
a
ruling
by
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--it
was
clear
for
purposes
of
what
we
were
doing.
i
mean,
the
fact
is,
of
course,
we're
up
here,
and
that
makes
it
a
whole
different
kind
of
case,
but
there
was
a
very
clear
rule,
and
the
rule
that
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
is
a
clear
rule.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
let
me
answer
that
in
two
stages,
because
to
some
extent
the
initial
part
of
your
question
deals
with
whether
the
artful
pleading
should
apply
even
in
preemption
cases.
i
mean,
in
a
preemption
case
there
is
a
state
law
claim
being
asserted...
avco,
franchise
tax
board,
and
so
forth...
yet
in
two
of
the
four
preemption
cases
the
court
has
said,
despite
what
it
appears
to
be,
it
is,
in
fact,
a
federal
claim
and
that
requires
delving
into
what
the
substance
of
the
action
is,
delving
into
federal
preemption
law
and
getting
into
all
sorts
of--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--let
me
answer
that
in
part
by
reference
to
a
decision
that's
cited
in
our
brief
but
isn't
emphasized
perhaps
to
the
extent
that
it
should
be
and
that's
the
celotex
v.
edwards.
now,
that
is
not
a
jurisdictional
case
in
the
state
v.
federal
jurisdictional
setting,
but
it
is
a
question
of
a
collateral
attack
on
a
bankruptcy
court
order.
in
that
case,
the
bankruptcy
court
issues
an
injunction.
the
injunction
prohibits
execution
upon
a
supersedeas
bond.
a
plaintiff
in
another
forum,
in
another
state
but
still
in
federal
court,
seeks
to
execute
upon
that
judgment
and
using
the
supersedeas
bond,
and
what
the
court
said
is
that
you
can't
do
that.
the
only
place
you
can
go
if
you
want
to
launch
a
collateral
attack
upon
a
bankruptcy
court
order,
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
original
court
and
what
this
is,
although
it's
filed
in
state
court,
it's
the
same
thing.
it
is
a
collateral
attack
on
a
bankruptcy
court
order.
it's
an
attempt
to
seek
a
state
court
review
of
that
order.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
excuse
me,
justice
o'connor,
i'm
not
sure
i--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well,
there
are
two
sets
of
nonparties
we're
dealing
with
here.
there
is
the
issue
of
two
of
mr.
odom's
clients
who
were
wives
of
the
two
people
who
were
clearly
represented
in
the
bankruptcy,
according
to
the
text
of
the
bankruptcy
court
order,
and
the
answer
to
that
is,
yes,
i
think
they
do
if
they
are
considered
privies
to
the
parties
who
were
there.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
then
i
think
that
under
those
circumstances
the
answer
would
probably
be
no.
at
that
point,
you
are
far
enough
away
from
someone
who
is
bound
by
what
happened
in
bankruptcy
court
that
you
would
have
to
stay
in
state
court
at
that
point.
that's
not
what
we
have
and,
frankly,
in
most
settings
like
this,
where
someone
seeks
to
collaterally
attack
an
order
of
the
federal
court
you're
not
going
to
have
that
problem.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
no,
i--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--there's
no
question
that
if
we
had
wanted
to
have
the
state
court
review
it,
the
state
court
had
the
power
to
review
it
and
i
agree
with
mr.
odom
that
that
review
would
have
had
to
be
conducted
pursuant
to
federal
law,
federal
law
of
res
judicata,
because
it's
a
federal
judgment
that
is
being
interpreted.
the
issue
before
you,
though,
is
whether
that's
the
only
way
that
you
could
go.
celotex,
while
it's
not
a
removal
question,
does
have
to
do
with
whether
the
court
that
had
the
supersedeas
bond
in
front
of
it
had
the
power
to
ignore
what
the
bankruptcy
court
to
do...
excuse
me,
had
the
power
to
ignore
the
order
of
the
bankruptcy
court
and
litigate,
relitigate
that
issue.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
that's
correct.
i
didn't
say
that
celotex
controlled
by
any
means.
i
simply
wanted
to
use
it
as
an
analogy,
the
suspicion
that
this
court
has,
that
any
court
has
when
there
is
a
collateral
attack
being
made
upon
a
bankruptcy
court
order.
and
then
let
me
go
back
to
moitie.
that
may--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well,
let...
i
wanted
to
get
back--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well,
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
moitie,
because
i
think
that's
the
second
part
of
the
answer
to
your
concern.
that
very
same
argument
was
available
in
moitie.
it
convinced
justice
brennan
that
the
case
did
not
belong
in
the
federal
court.
moitie
on
its
face
stated
only
state
causes
of
action,
the
second
complaint
in
moitie
and,
as
you
pointed
out
in
the
constitutional
context,
you
can
assert
claims
based
upon
state
law
and
claims
based
upon
federal
law
based
upon
identical
facts,
so
if
there's
not
something
more
to
moitie
than
a
factual
finding,
we're...
the
court
is
essentially
saying
district
courts
are
free
to
recharacterize
claims
almost
at
their
discretion.
i
mean,
then
there
are
no
rules.
a
court
simply
looks
and
says,
well,
this
looks
like
the
federal
case
i
saw
before.
it's
only
based
on
state
law,
but
it
looks
like
the
federal
case,
so
i'm
going
to
recharacterize
it
and
authorize
removal.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
i
recognize
that
and
my
suggestion
then,
and
i
believe
i
may
have
begun
the
answer
in
response
to
one
of
the
chief
justice's
questions,
is
that
if
you
want
to
interpret
moitie
that
narrowly,
still
the
characterization
of
what
the
fifth
circuit
has
said
about
this
case,
which
is,
this
is
an
attempt
to
retry
what
happened
in
the
bankruptcy
court,
would
still
carry
the
day.
under
the
narrowest
construction
of
moitie
there
has
been
in
effect
a
finding
by
the
court
below
that
this
is
the
bankruptcy
case,
because--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well,
there
are
a
couple
of
distinctions
between
how
2283
would
work
and
how
the...
moitie--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--if
the
judgment
of
the
federal
court
were
based
entirely
on
state
law,
that
would
be
one
difference.
the
rules
that
all
the
lower
courts
have
come
up
with
have
to
do
with
whether
the
federal
court
is
adjudicating
issues
of
federal
law,
so
that
the
subsequent
claim
is
in
effect
a
claim
arising--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--no,
2283--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--2283
does
work
in
diversity
cases.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
so
part
of
what
i'm
saying
is
that
2283
cuts
more
broadly
in
that
sense.
2283
has
also
been
applied
in
cases
involving
issue
preclusion
as
opposed
to
claim
preclusion.
that
is,
there
is
an
issue
that
may
arise
in
the
subsequent
state
court
case
which
the
defendant
says
is
now
precluded
as
a
result
of
something
that
happened
in
federal
court.
that
would
also
be
subject
to
a
2283
injunction.
we
certainly
don't
contend
that
there
would
be
any
right
to
remove
based
upon
the
preclusion
of
a
single
issue
in
what
is
otherwise
a
state
court
case,
so
in
both
instances
2283
cuts
differently
and,
to
the
extent
that
we're
saying
that
what
mr.
odom
has
really
filed
is
a
federal
claim,
there's
already,
in
the
case
of
a
federal
cause
of
action
filed
in
the
state
court
in
the
event
of
a
res
judicata
situation,
the
right
either
to
remove
or
to
seek
an
injunction.
if--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
if
we
did
not
answer
his
complaint,
assuming
he
could
prove
up
his
case,
yes.
i
mean,
he
still
has
to
prove
it
up
to
the--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--to
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
in
the--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--in
the
proof
that
he
would
offer,
i
am
assuming
that
he
would
simply
offer
proof
of
debt,
proof
of
mortgage,
essentially,
and
you're
correct.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
that's
true.
that
was
also
true
in
moitie.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--let
me--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--let
me
suggest
a
couple
of
policy
considerations
that
do
not
apply
across
the
board
but
do
apply
in
situations
like
this
arising
out
of
bankruptcy,
free
and
clear
sales
orders.
this
is
part
of
the
essence
of
what
bankruptcy
courts
do.
unlike
the
situation
in
celotex,
where
there
was
a
significant
issue
of
bankruptcy
jurisdiction,
there's
no
issue
of
bankruptcy
jurisdiction
here.
the
stability
of
titles
is
at
issue.
in
effect,
what
we
would
have
here
is
a
procedural
avenue
that
someone
dissatisfied
with
an
order
of
the
bankruptcy
could
use
and
run
to
state
court
and
you
also
have,
not
withstanding
the
general
competence
of
state
courts
and
their
ability
to
consider
bankruptcy
issues...
courts
rarely
deal
with
bankruptcy
issues
and
so
what
you
would
have,
at
least
in
the
narrow
type
of
situation
that
we
have
presented
by
this
case,
is
a
situation
in
which
the
stability
of
titles
that
are
obtained
through
bankruptcy
is
at
issue.
and
that
is
exactly
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
third
party
who's
purchased
this
property.
there
are
millions
of
dollars
that
have
been
put
into
a
piece
of
property
and
now,
10
years
after
the
bankruptcy
court
order,
we
have
an
attack
in
state
court
seeking
to
enforce
the
mortgage.
so
in
terms
of
policy
considerations
i
would
suggest
those
at
a
minimum
might
say
that
if
someone
is
seeking
to
foreclose
on
a
mortgage
that
is
the
subject
of
a
free
and
clear
sale
order
in
bankruptcy
court,
that
at
least
can
be
recharacterized
as
an
attempt
to
appeal
from
or
seek
to
modify
the
bankruptcy
court
order.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
right,
and
that's
the
point.
whether
you
want
to
go
the
distance
that
we
have
suggested
in
our
brief
you
go,
or
just
go
the
very
short
distance
that
i
tried
to
outline
for
justice
breyer
a
moment
ago,
at
a
minimum
what
moitie
says
is
that
courts,
trial
courts,
courts
of
appeal
do
have
some
limited
discretion
to
recharacterize
a
purported
state
cause
of
action
that
has
been
filed
if,
in
their
view,
considering
all
the
circumstances,
this
is
really
an
attempt
to
file
a
claim
or
redo
something
under
federal
law,
and
we're
suggesting
that
the
fifth
circuit
at
a
minimum
said
this
is
an
attempt--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--well...
yes.
this
is
an
attempt
to
seek
state
court
review
of
what
the
bankruptcy
court--
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
--on
the
surface,
yes.
i
think
when
you
look
below
the
surface,
no.
in
order
for
there
to
have
been
a
contested
proceeding
in
the
bankruptcy
court
in
the
first
place,
they
had
to
file
an
objection
to
the
trustee's
propsal
that
the
property
be
sold
free
and
clear.
if
you
look
at
the
bankruptcy
rules,
the
contested
proceeding
is
triggered
by
their
objection,
so
they,
in
fact,
instigated
the
contested
proceeding
in
bankruptcy
court
that
forced
the
court
to
determine
whether
the
property
could
be
sold
free
and
clear
of
their
lien,
and
they
lost.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
well,
let
me
suggest
that
the
distinction
doesn't
really
hold
water
if
you
take
it
a
step
farther.
by
that
logic,
if
someone
files
a
federal
constitutional
claim
in
federal
court
and
a
parallel
state
constitutional
claim
in
state
court,
the
state
constitutional
claim
could
be
removed
because
it's
nothing
but
the
federal
constitutional
claim
and
i
don't
think
anyone
believes
that
to
be
the
law.
mr.
charles
l.
stern,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
