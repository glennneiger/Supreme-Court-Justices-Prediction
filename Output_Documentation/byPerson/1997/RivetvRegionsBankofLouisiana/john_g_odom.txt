mr.
john
g.
odom
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case,
your
honors,
is
whether
a
novel
res
judicata
exception
should
be
engrafted
into
the
settled
rules
of
federal
removal
jurisdiction.
before
we
address
these
removal
issues,
i
believe
it
would
be
helpful
to
set
out
in
the
nature
of
the
action
that
we
filed
in
state
court
below
on
behalf
of
these
petitioners.
your
honors,
my
clients
loaned
$1.3
million
in
1984
to
other
sophisticated
individuals
in
a
transaction
at
a
time
of
high
interest
rates,
at
an
interest
rate
of
20
percent
with
a
note
and
a
subsequent
mortgage
up
to
an
amount
of
$5
million.
we
took
a
note
and
we
took
a
mortgage
on
the
real
property,
or
the
leasehold
estate
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
basically
our
state
action
filed
10
years
later
is
a
standard
mortgage
foreclosure
action
seeking
either
to
recognize
our
mortgage
or
to
have
our
debt
paid.
it's
a
hybrid
in
personam
in
rem
action
which
is
permissible
under
louisiana
law.
there's
a
second
aspect
of
our
claim
which
is
similar
but
distinct.
that
is,
a
prior
bankruptcy
proceeding,
as
the
court
is
aware,
had
authorized
the
respondents
in
this
action
or
their
predecessors
in
interest
to
procure
cancellation
of
our
lien,
which
was
duly
recorded
in
the
conveyance
records
of
orleans
parish,
and
it
empowered
them
to
do
that.
they
left
bankruptcy
court
one
day
in
1986
with
the
right
to
have
our
lien
canceled
according
to
the
louisiana
lien
cancellation
procedure.
they
never
took
advantage
of
that
right.
the
bankruptcy
court
acknowledged,
we
take
the
position,
your
honors,
implicitly
louisiana's
procedure
to
have
liens
cancelled.
it
acknowledged
a
two
step
process,
because
it
not
only
ordered
the
subject
property
to
be
sold
free
and
clear
of
all
liens,
it
also
ordered
that
the
recorder
of
mortgages
erase
the
liens.
this
was
never
done
and
now,
in
a
footnote,
if
you
will,
to
this
argument,
they've
waited
too
long
and
since
the
filing
of
this
lawsuit
their
right
to
execute
on
those
liens
has
expired
under
louisiana
law.
mr.
john
g.
odom
your
honor,
i'm
just
trying
to
give
a
little
background
to
the
facts,
because
i
feel
that...
i
feel
that
it
would
be
important.
the
facts
are
somewhat
tangled
and
i
thought
it
would
be
good
to
lay
those
out.
we
don't
feel
it's...
there
are
a
variety
of
reasons
why
we
don't
believe
res
judicata
would
bar
our
claim
and
those
we
will
all
adjudicate
below,
assuming
that
it's
remanded,
of
course.
your
honors,
it's
important
to
remember
in
that
connection
that
two
of
the
four
persons
that
we
sued
were
not
even
present
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding,
and
two
of
our
four
petitioners
did
not
appear
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
and
received
absolutely
no
notice
of
it.
we
claim
against
these
two--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--your
honor,
it's
important
for
us,
we
believe,
to
show
the
court
exactly
how
far
this
doctrine
will
go
if
a
res
judicata
exception
is
carved
out
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and,
that
being
so,
you
would
have
to
see
that
this
is
not
even
a
proper
res
judicata
situation,
because
two
of
the
four
persons
were
not
even...
two
of
the
four
persons
we
sued
were
not
even
a
part
of
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
therefore,
my
point
in
bringing
these
to
the
court's
attention,
your
honor,
is,
look
at
how
far
this
goes.
where
it's
going
is,
if
you
have
any
part
of
a
claim
that
a
bankruptcy
procedure
has
affected
in
any
way
someone,
or
that
person's
privity
and
interest
in
any
way,
or
that
can
be
alleged,
that's
going
to
be
brought
up
by
defendants
as
a
res
judicata
exception.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
complete
res
judicata
exception.
indeed,
it
wasn't
in
this
case.
mr.
john
g.
odom
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
odom
yes,
sir.
that's
exactly
what
i'm
trying
to
suggest.
and
your
honor...
well,
we
believe
that
the
opinions
below
were
not
even
internally
consistent,
if
you
will,
in
that
connection,
because
they
likened
their
new
jurisdictional
basis
to...
of
complete
preclusion
to
complete
preemption,
but
complete
preemption,
as
this
court
has
stated
over
and
over
again,
really
means
complete
preemption.
it
means
that
congress
has
so
thoroughly
occupied
a
whole
field
of
the
law
that
any
state
law
claim
is
really
a
federal
claim,
but
here
complete
preclusion,
as
they
use
it,
is
not
complete
because
this
state
action
was
not
completely
precluded
by
res
judicata.
to
show
just
how
far
it
goes,
your
honor,
not
only
did
the
district
court
below
decide
the
case
on
the
merits,
decide
that
there
was
no
claim
there,
that
the
plaintiffs
were
dead,
if
you
will,
and
use
that
as
a
basis
for
removal
jurisdiction,
he
then
used
that
removal
jurisdiction
to
get
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
the
two
parties
who
were
not
involved
in
the
res
judicata
aspect,
and
so
what
we
have
is
the
decision
on
the
merits
that
the
claim
was
completely
precluded
being
used
as
justification
to
assert
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
parties
whose
claim...
against
whose
claims
we
did
not
have
a
completely
precluded
claim,
so
it
really
is
not
even
internally
consistent
and
it
does
show,
if
you
will,
the
parade
of
horribles.
but
fundamentally,
your
honors,
as
we've
stated
in
our
brief,
res
judicata
is
an
affirmative
defense
and
removal
cannot
be
based
on
an
affirmative
defense.
it's
codified
in
the
statute,
it's
been
reconfirmed
many
times
by
this
court,
most
recently
by
franchise
tax
board,
by
caterpillar,
and
by
oklahoma
tax
commission--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--yes,
your
honor.
we
don't
urge
an...
that
the
preemption
doctrine
has
to
be
overruled.
that
is
now
so
firmly
in...
fixed
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
that
we
believe
that
it
has
worked
well.
it's
fine.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
overruled.
but
the
court
has
been
very
careful
about
articulating
any
further
exceptions
to
the
well
pleaded
complaint
rule
if
the
avco
doctrine
be
an
exception.
i
know
there's
academic
dispute
about
that.
what
is
clear
with
respect
to
the
facts
of
this
case
is
that,
even
if
the
affirmative
defense,
the
federal
affirmative
defense
is
the
only
real
issue
in
the
case,
even
if
it
is
absolutely
dispositive
of
the
merits
and
is
the
only
thing
that
has
to
be
decided
below,
it
cannot
be
used
as
a
basis
for
federal
removal
jurisdiction.
now,
there
is
nothing
special
about
the
res
judicata
affirmative
defense
as
opposed
to
any
other
affirmative
defenses
that
might
be
raised
by
someone
below
as
a
justification
for
removing
a
case
to
federal
court.
indeed,
your
honors--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--your
honor,
that
does
show
that
congress
has
recognized
the
relitigation
situation,
has
addressed
it
in
the
appropriate
way
after
full
consideration,
and
has
crafted
the
relitigation
exception
to
section
2283.
that
is
a
different
remedy,
though,
than
removal
based
upon
res
judicata,
because,
as
this
court's
ruling
in
chick
kam
choo
makes
clear,
the
2283
relitigation
exception
to
the
anti
injunction
act
is
narrower
than
the
full
range
of
res
judicata.
it
also
is
an
equitable
proceeding,
and
the
court
does
not
have
to
enjoin
a
state
court
from
relitigating
something
that's
previously
been
decided.
the
court
can
take
full
cognizance
of
all
the
facts
and
circumstances,
the
equitable
arguments
on
both
sides.
i
dare
say
if
that
exception
had
been
applied
in
this
case
there
are
equities
on
both
sides
of
this
case
that
would
need
to
have
been
considered.
it's
far
different
from
enlarging
the
scope
of
federal
removal
jurisdiction
by
making
res
judicata
an
affirmative
defense,
a
permissible
basis
for
removal
jurisdiction.
mr.
john
g.
odom
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
trying
to
cast
in
my
own
mind
as
to
whether
there
would
be
any
conceivable
way
that
our
claim
could
be
recharacterized
as
a
federal
claim,
i
can't
imagine
how
our
claim
could
have
been
recharacterized
on
the
face
of
the
pleadings
or
any
other
way
so
as
to
state
a
federal
cause
of
action.
there
is
no
general
federal
law
of
mortgages
that
i'm
aware
of.
there's
no
federal
statute
that
deals
with
the
issues
that
we're
talking
about.
we
have
a
third
party
beneficiary
claim
against
the
browns
under
louisiana
state
law,
under
the
louisiana
state
law
doctrine
of
stipulation
pour
entree,
which
is
similar
to
the
third
party
beneficiary
doctrine.
all
of
those
are
third
party
claims.
not
a
single
one
is
a
federal
claim.
that's
why
we
feel
so
strongly
that
this
cannot
be
cast
as
an
artful
pleading
case.
there's
no
way
that
we
could
have
artfully
recast
any
of
our
pleadings.
there's
nothing
we
could
have
artfully
recast.
even
if
the
statute
and
the
jurisprudence
of
the
court
allowed
us
to
plead
on
the
face
of
our
pleadings
an
affirmative
defense
to
somehow
get
ourselves
into
federal
court,
i
don't
see
how
it
could
have
been
recast
in
an
artful
way
as
a
federal
affirmative
defense,
so
it's
an
entirely
state
law
cause
of
action,
something
that
we
could
not
have
brought
in
federal
court.
the
res
judicata
issue
that
they
try
to
bring
us
in
on
removal
is
something
that
we
did
not
bring...
it's
somebody
else's
bankruptcy.
it's
a
very
far
cry
from
the
simple
situation
where
a
sues
b
in
federal
court
and
loses
and
then
a
goes
back
down
to
federal
court,
to
state
court
and
brings
the
identical
claim
in
state
court
leaving
out
one
or
two
words.
that's
the
situation
that
the
court
had
in
the
moitie
petition.
it's
a
very
far
cry
from
that.
it
wasn't
our
bankruptcy.
two
of
our
petitioners
weren't
even
there,
had
no
notice
of
any
of
it.
two
of
the
defendants
weren't
even
there,
and
the
state
courts...
the
federal
court
had
to
acknowledge
that
they
weren't
bound
by
the
res
judicata
that
he
used
to
remove
the
case
and
assumed
supplemental
jurisdiction
over
them
and
dismissed
that
claim
as
well.
i
think
that
there
is
truly
nothing
special
about
res
judicata.
if
you
were
to
allow
the
res
judicata
defense
to
establish
removal
of
jurisdiction
it's
hard
to
see
why
other
defenses,
other
affirmative
defenses
might
not
be
as
worthy,
but
the
court
has
already
spoken
to
that.
indeed,
your
honors,
any
given
application
of
res
judicata
is
likely
to
be
less
significant
than
any
given
application
of
the
tribal
immunity
defense,
because
tribal
immunity
is
the
result
of
a
solemn
treaty
between
the
congress
of
the
united
states
and
a
sovereign
indian
nation.
it's
hard
to
think
of
how
something
could
be
more
completely
extinguished
than
a
claim
of...
based
on...
claim
falling
to
the
defense
of
tribal
immunity,
yet
this
court
in
oklahoma
tax
commission
in
1989
said
that
that
has
to
be
decided
by
the
state
courts.
the
state
courts
are
presumed
competent
to
decide
these
issues
of
federal
law.
they
do
it
all
the
time.
the
respondents
say
that
our
claim
was
completely
extinguished
by
the
res
judicata
effect
of
the
bankruptcy
court
below,
and
that's
what
makes
it
so
different.
but
your
honor,
that's
exactly
what
the
defendants
argued
in
caterpillar.
they
argued
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
governed
by
federal
law
completely
extinguished
the
state
law
contract
claims
in
that
case
and
in
that
case
again
this
court
said,
that
kind
of
extinguishment
doesn't
mean
anything.
you
cannot
use
an
affirmative
defense
to
establish
removal
jurisdiction
in
this
case.
mr.
john
g.
odom
your
honor,
the
more
one
reads
moitie,
the
more
difficult
it
is
to
see
how
so
many
people
became
convinced
that
this
court
was
articulating
a
new
theory
of
removal
jurisdiction
based
on
res
judicata.
no
such
theory
is
mentioned
in
footnote
2
or
anywhere
else.
justice
brennan's
vigorous
dissent
which
everyone
cites
doesn't
even
address
that.
it
doesn't
mention
anything
about
a
res
judicata
defense.
it
addresses
only
the
preemption
aspect
of
it
and
the
antitrust
aspects.
the...
if
you
consider
the
language
employed
by
the
court
in
the
moitie
footnote,
the
court
defers
to
the
factual
findings
by
the
district
court
below
and
notes
that
at
least
some
of
those
claims
were
sufficiently
federal
in
character
to
support
removal
jurisdiction,
at
least
some
of
the
claims.
that's
not
the
language
of
complete
preclusion.
if
it
was
completely
precluded,
we
believe
the
court
would
have
said
so.
and
your
honors,
with
all
respect,
the
moitie
decision
is
virtually
a
treatise
on
the
law
of
res
judicata.
it
goes
into
every
aspect
of
it,
from
the
history
of
it
in
our
jurisprudence
to
the
way
it's
used
and
the
way
it
has
to
be
used
and
we
dare
say
that,
if
there
had
been
some
intention
to
highlight
this
aspect
of
the
law
of
res
judicata,
it
would
have
been
mentioned.
and
your
honors,
the
court
in
moitie,
this
court
actually
remanded
the
issue
of
res
judicata
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
decide,
stating
that
it
was
"unnecessary
for
the
court
to
reach
that
issue.
"
but
if
the
court
in
moitie
had
been
using
complete
preclusion,
res
judicata
as
its
ground
for
removal
jurisdiction,
then
the
res
judicata
issue
would
already
have
been
decided.
there
wouldn't
have
been
anything
to
remand
to
the
ninth
circuit
for
consideration.
there
would
have
been
nothing
to
send
back.
mr.
john
g.
odom
your
honors,
it's
clear
from
reading
the
moitie
opinion
and
the
opinions
below
that
the
sufficient
federal...
sufficiently
federal
character
of
the
claims
brought
in
state
court
was
an
intent
to
rely
on
federal
law,
an
intent
to
really
state
federal
claims
in
state
law
disguise.
this
becomes
crystal
clear
when
one
looks
at
the
unreported
district
court
opinion
which,
your
honor,
i
confess
i
did
not
do
until
last
week,
when
i
came
and
looked
at
your
archives
upstairs,
but
it's
in
there
on
the
third
floor.
the
district
court's
opinion
below
makes
it
absolutely
clear
that
the
second
complaint,
filed
after
the
federal
complaint
was
dismissed,
was
identical
in
every
respect
to
the
federal
claim
that
had
been
there.
indeed,
in
oral
argument
it
was
made
plain
that
the
only
word
that
was
changed
in
the
second
complaint
was
the
word
antitrust.
the
court...
the
discussion
of
that
which
makes
it
very
clear,
two
paragraph
discussion,
is
found
at
pages
16a
and
17a
of
judge
spencer
williams'
june
30,
1977
opinion
below.
the...
the...
and
also
makes
it
clear
that
the
state
law
plaintiffs
had
pleaded
identical
words
from
the
government's
civil
claim
and
the
government's
criminal
claim,
criminal
action,
two
separate
federal
actions.
they
had
initially...
they
had
initially
indicated
their
intent
to
be
in
federal
court
by
filing
the
case
in
federal
court.
i'm
speaking
of
the
browns
now.
mrs.
moitie
originally
filed
in
state
court.
she
did
not
wind
up
before
this
court.
it
was
the
browns'
claim
that
wound
up
before
this
court,
even
though
the
case
is
called
moitie.
the
browns
had
originally
evinced
their
desire
to
be
in
federal
court
by
filing
in
federal
court.
then
they
went
back
to
state
court,
restated
their
complaint
identically
word
for
word,
leaving
out
the
word
antitrust
and
copying
the
federal
pleadings
of
the
federal
civil
action
and
the
federal
criminal
action.
it
is
simply...
it
is
simply
an
application
of
the
artful
pleading
doctrine
in
the
antitrust
context,
and
there's
every
reason
to
believe,
as
we
set
out
in
our
brief,
that
that's
exactly
what
it
was.
there
is
zero
reason
to
believe,
either
in
the
opinion
of
the
ninth
circuit
below,
or
in
judge
spencer
williams'
opinion,
or
in
the
opinion
of
this
court,
that
there
was
an
effort
to
involve
some
new
exception
to
the
removal
jurisdiction
doctrines
articulated
by
the
court.
while--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--yes,
sir.
it's--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--in
the
state
court
below,
your
honor,
they
alleged
unfair
competition
and
breach
of
contract.
they
may
have
alleged--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--state
law,
various--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
odom
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
odom
well--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--well,
the
artful
pleading
doctrine,
your
honor,
exists
for
situations
where
the
claim
can
be
recharacterized
as
a
federal
claim
and
i
believe,
on
a
straightforward
basis,
that's
what
the
judge
in
the
moitie
case
did
and
that
is
what
this
court
was
doing
in
saying
that
at
least
some
of
those
claims
were
sufficiently
federal
in
character
to
support
removal
jurisdiction.
but
in
any
event,
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
law
of
res
judicata
or
carving
out
a
new
exception
whereby
an
affirmative
defense
itself
could
be
the
basis
for
jurisdiction.
what
the
district
court
did
in
that
case
was,
in
fact,
accepted
jurisdiction
on
the
basis
of
the
recharacterization
of
federal
claims
and
then,
having
acquired
jurisdiction,
dismissed
those
claims
due
to
res
judicata.
there
was
no
linkage
of
res
judicata
to
jurisdiction
in
the
case
anywhere
along
the
line,
including
in
this
court.
there
was
no
effort
to
establish
jurisdiction
by
reference
to
res
judicata.
they
did
not
accept
jurisdiction
because
the
claim
was
being
dismissed
on
the
basis
of
res
judicata,
and
that's
the
odd
conundrum
that
we
articulated
as
issue
2
in
our
questions
presented.
the
court
in
this
case
decided,
made
a
decision
on
the
merits
and
decided
that
the
claim
was
completely
destroyed
and
used
that
decision
on
the
merits
to
justify
having
jurisdiction
in
the
case.
nothing
like
that
occurred
in
the
district
court's
analysis
in
moitie.
he
was
simply
applying
a
straightforward
artful
pleading
doctrine
case.
your
honors--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--well,
your
honors,
if
a
claim
is
brought
under...
if
we're
assuming
that
a
claim
is
originally
brought
in
state
court,
and
it
also
asserts
violations
of
the
federal
constitution,
i
say
that
claim
is
immediately
removable
to
federal
court
on
the--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--yes,
ma'am.
mr.
john
g.
odom
well,
in
my
view,
your
honor,
that
would
be
easily
distinguished
because
the
state
constitution
is
a
separate
document
and
many
of
them
are
very,
very
different
from
the
federal
constitution.
the
claims
would
be...
if
there
were
legitimate
state
constitutional
claims
they
would
possibly
be
vastly
different
from
any
federal
claims.
mr.
john
g.
odom
no,
sir,
they're
not.
they're
not.
there's
no
complete
preemption
under
antitrust--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--your
honor,
in
that
case--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--in
that
case
the
judge
literally
drew
a
chart,
which
is
also
in
the
record
upstairs,
of
the
differences...
of
the
differences
in
the
claims.
i
think
it's...
the
way
i
explain
it,
your
honor,
is
that
it's
a
case
by
case
analysis
and,
if
there
were
a
state
law
that
were
vastly
different
from
the
federal
law,
perhaps
that
would
mandate
a
different
conclusion.
this
court
was
satisfied
in
the
moitie
case
that
at
least
some
of
the
factual
findings
by
the
district
court
supported
jurisdiction.
that
is
a
good
example
of
why
i
think
the
word
factual
finding
was
used.
it
is
a
comparison
on
a
case
by
case
basis
to
find
out
what
is
really
going
on
and
it
seems
to
turn
on,
at
least
in
part,
on
the
intent
of
the
parties
to
bring
a
federal
action,
which
was
evinced
very
forcefully
in
the
moitie
case.
your
honors,
our
case
essentially...
our
argument
essentially
is
that
there's...
that
there
is
no
removal
jurisdiction
based
on
affirmative
defense.
this
is
not
a
case
of
artful
pleading,
there
is
no
way
that
it
could
have
been
recharacterized
as
a
federal
complaint,
and
that
moitie
does
not
dictate
any
kind
of
result
of
the
type
that
my
colleagues
would
like
the
court
to
adopt,
and
we
suggest
that
it
would
be
a
very
bad
idea
for
such
claims
to
be...
such
a
rule
to
be
adopted.
it's
hard
to
see
where
it
would
stop.
it's
easy
to
see
from
the
facts
of
this
case,
as
i
indicated
in
response
to
justice
stevens--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--well,
your
honor,
if
one
does
that,
then
it's
easy
to
see
that
the
courts
below
will
get
into
all
kinds
of
factual
considerations,
such
as
who
were
exactly
the
parties
before
the
court?
who
were
their
privies?
who
were
the...
what
part
of
the
claim
resolves
what
part
of
the
state
law
claim?
are
we
dealing
with
husband
and
wife,
as
you
know
was
an
issue
in
this
case.
if
we
are,
what
are
the
state
domestic
relations
laws?
is
there
a
separate
property
agreement
if
there's
a
community
property
state.
and
you
can
see
this
turning
into
a
mini
trial
on
the
basis...
on
the
issue
of
removal
jurisdiction
so
much
without
any
reason
for
it,
because
there's
no
harm...
any
possible
beneficial
gain
in
efficiency
or
anything
else
that
could
be
gained
by
making
such
a
rule
is
far
outweighed
by
the
harm
it
would
cause.
mr.
john
g.
odom
federal
res
judicata
law,
your
honor.
mr.
john
g.
odom
yes,
sir,
and
i
believe
the
state
court
would
apply
federal
res
judicata
law
and
your
honors,
there
is...
as
justice
ginsburg
indicated,
there
is
a
remedy
if
anyone
feels
aggrieved
by
someone
trying
to
relitigate
something
previously
decided
in
federal
court.
section
2283,
the
relitigation
exception,
provides
that
remedy
and
provides
a
far
more
sensitive
means
of
application
than
any
kind
of
removal,
absolute
removal
rule
would
supply.
furthermore,
the
most
obvious
remedy
is
that
we've
got
a
cadre
of
50
states
with
very
competent
state
judges,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
state
court
judges
are
competent
to
decide
issues
of
federal
law.
it's
done
on
a
routine
basis.
they
do
it
every
day.
there
simply
is
no
harm
here
to
fix,
and
the
fix
would
require
a
terrible
rupture
of
very
subtle
jurisprudence
of
this
court.
your
honors,
that
concludes
my
argument.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
g.
odom
thank
you.
mr.
john
g.
odom
thank
you,
your
honor.
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
just
a
couple
of
points
to
make
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions
that
were
directed
to
mr.
stern.
as
far
as
taking
a
footnote
and
running
with
it,
i
didn't
make
this
obvious
point
in
my
argument,
but
we
did
make
it
in
the
brief.
taking
this
particular
footnote
and
running
with
it,
if
you're
a
district
judge
below,
is
even
less
appropriate
than
in
other
circumstances,
because
here
we
had
three
unanimous
opinions
of
this
court
following
the
date
of
the
footnote
that
expressly
reconfirmed
all
of
the
fundamental
elements
of
removal
jurisdiction
in
exactly
the
way
that
we've
argued,
so
a
clearer
view
than
that
would
be
hard
to
find.
i
agree
with
mr.
stern
that
stability
of
titles
is
important,
but
under
his
view
the
state
recordation
doctrine
is
of
no
moment
at
all
and
can
be
completely
ignored
when,
if
there
is
a
bankruptcy,
a
two
part
bankruptcy
judgment
order,
the
first
part
where
the
judge
snaps
his
fingers
and
says,
poof,
if
you
will,
all
liens...
the
property
may
be
sold
free
and
clear
of
all
liens,
and
the
second
part
of
his
order
orders
and
directs
and
authorizes
the
erasure
of
all
the
liens.
the
second
part
is
not
taken
care
of
and
is
not
fulfilled,
then
if
you
simply
allow
him
to
rely
on
the
first
part
of
it,
then
it
says
that
the
entire
state
record,
state
title
recordation
policy
is
of
no
moment
at
all,
because
a
party
in
another
state
is
entitled
to
rely
on
what's
on
file
down
at
the
new
orleans
conveyance
office
and
under
mr.
stern's
theory
would
not
be.
stability
of
titles
is
important.
i
will
note
that
there
was
no
adversary
proceeding
under
rule
7001
in
the
bankruptcy
court
below.
this
is
an
argument
that
we
made
below
to
suggest
that
the
matter
was
not
in
fact
actually
litigated.
we
didn't
even
have
a
cause
of
action
at
the
date
of
the
bankruptcy.
not
only
were
two
of
our
people
not
there,
we
didn't
even
have
any
cause
of
action
because
the
browns
had
not
attempted
to
pass
title
in
derogation
of
our
mortgage
at
that
time.
the
bank
had
not
let
its
right
to
enforce
the
erasure
order
expire
of
that
time...
at
that
time.
there
was
no...
our
loan
was
not
in
default
at
that
time.
we
were
not
claimants
in
the
bankruptcy
proceeding.
this
was
a
balloon
payment,
a
one
time
balloon
payment
that
was
not
mature
at
the
time
of
the
bankruptcy.
in
fact,
the
loan
had
been
made
on
it
shortly
before
the
bankruptcy.
the
obligation
sued
upon
is,
in
fact,
a
new
post
bankruptcy
obligation
due
to
the
written
waiver
of
prescription
which
we
say,
under
state
law,
constitutes
a
novation.
that's
a--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--it
does.
mr.
john
g.
odom
it
does.
it's
in
the
record,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
john
g.
odom
--no,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
odom
no,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
odom
i
didn't
write
it,
your
honor.
i'm
not
sure.
but
the
novations
are
in
the
record
at
pages
138
and
139
of
this
matter.
your
honors,
as
far
as
any
particular
concerns
about
bankruptcy,
obviously
congress
can
address
that
if
it
wants
to.
if
it
wants
to
pass
a
statute
saying
anything
relating
to
bankruptcy
is
to
be
done
a
different
way,
then
that's
fine,
it
can.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
your
honor,
i
believe
i
have
stated
my
argument
as
best
as
i
can.
