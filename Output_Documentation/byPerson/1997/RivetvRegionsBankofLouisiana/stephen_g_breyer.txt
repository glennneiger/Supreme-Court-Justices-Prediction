justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
did
they...
i'm
somewhat
curious.
i
take
it
that
the
browns'
original
federal
claim
said
the
defendants
had
done
something
that
violated
the
antitrust...
the
federal
antitrust
laws.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
they
left
out
the
word
antitrust,
so
what
were
they
claiming
in
the
state
court?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so
they
had
a
list
of
defendants'
activities
they
said
that
violate
federal
antitrust,
then
they
leave
out
the
word
antitrust,
they
say
the
same
thing
violates
state
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
state...
unfair
competition
law--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--contract
law,
or
something.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well...
they'd
say,
well,
different
claim.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
single
activity
can
violate
state
law,
it
can
also
violate
federal
law,
and
we
said
in
federal
court
it
violated
federal
law,
and
now
we
say
the
same
thing
violates
state
law,
a
different
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but--
--no,
but
why,
if
it's
an
open...
if
it's
an
open
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
should
the
law
recognize
any
exception
but
for
the
possible
preemption
exemption?
it's
a
doctrine
that
is
supposed
to
be
clear,
so
people
don't
spend
all
their
money
litigating
jurisdiction
and,
therefore,
you
have
to
be,
if
you're
a
district
judge
or
a
party
you
have
to
know
what
you're
doing,
what
court
you're
supposed
to
be
in
and
the
rule
is
absolutely
clear,
read
the
complaint.
if
the
complaint
states
a
federal
cause
of
action,
you
know
where...
you
know
it's
possible
to
remove
it.
if
it
doesn't,
you
know
it's
not
going
to
be
removable.
that
helps
the
judges,
it
helps
the
parties.
now,
why
wouldn't
that
be
the
rule,
clear
and
simple,
instead
of
having
endless
expenditure,
as
this
case
may
illustrate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
would
be
clearer
that
you...
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
complaint.
if
it
states...
the
complaint
i
think
here
must
say...
i
couldn't
find
it
in
the
documents,
but
i'm
guessing
the
complaint
must
say
there's
a
piece
of
paper
called
the
louisiana
equivalent
of
a
mortgage.
it's
on
file
somewhere.
go
read
that
piece
of
paper.
that
piece
of
paper
as
a
matter
of
state
law
says
we're
entitled
to
the
building,
or
some
money,
or
something.
that's
what
it
says,
i
take
it.
you
say,
we
have
a
defense.
the
defense
is
that
the
bankruptcy
court
makes
that...
order
makes
that
void.
that
sounds
to
me
a
classic
case:
state
law
claim,
federal
defense.
now,
if
that's
what's
going
on,
why
should
you
be
able
to
remove?
how
could
we
let
you
remove
without
eroding
the
basic
doctrine,
look
at
the
face
of
the
complaint?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if...
if
you
leave...
i'd
like
to
go
back
for
a
second,
because
i
didn't
get
your
answer
to
my
particular
question.
normally,
we
look
at
the
complaint
and
you,
i
think
correctly,
pointed
out
that
there
is
one
exception,
namely,
preemption.
now,
if...
forgetting
the
footnote
in
moitie,
is
there
any
reason
that
we
should
have
two
exceptions?
i
mean,
let
us
say,
i'd
start
from
the
hypothetical
position
one
exception
is
bad
enough.
now,
i
want
to
know
if
there's
any
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
we
should
go
into
two--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
what
it
will
be.
of
course,
the
concern
is
that
if
you
have
two,
then
there
might
be
three,
et
cetera.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
you
are
asking
for
is
an
exception
for
a
defense.
we
have
a
defense.
we
want
to
go
into
federal
court
on
the
basis
of
the
defense.
