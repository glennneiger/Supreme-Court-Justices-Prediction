justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
could
be
to
the
extent
the
anti
injunction
act
makes
an
exception,
the
relitigation
exception.
that
does
show
that
there
is
something
special
about
relitigating
a
case
that
was
resolved
in
federal
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
your
claim,
leaving
aside
the
bankruptcy,
is
wholly
state
in
origin.
there's
no
federal
element
to
it,
is
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
made
the
case...
what
was
the
federal
character
of
the
claim,
as
distinguished
from
the
preclusion
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
explain
that
a
little
further,
because
there
are
many
instances,
for
example,
constitutional
law,
where
the
facts
are
the
same
and
a
claim
may
be
brought
under
the
federal
constitution,
and
then
the
same
claim
is
made
in
the
state
court
saying
the
state
constitution
means
something
different,
or
more,
so
why
is
it
different
in
the
antitrust
context?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no,
i'm
supposing
a
case
in
federal
court
first.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
federal
court
says,
you
don't
have
that
federal
constitutional
right.
then
you
bring
the
same
case
over
again
in
state
court
and
say,
but
i
have
a
state
constitutional
right
based
on
those
very
same
facts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
stern,
let's
slice
of
one
part
of
that,
where
there
is
no
federal
law,
where
there's
blanket
preemption
so
state
law
effectively
doesn't
exist
because
federal
law
covers
the
field
entirely.
that's
one
set
of
circumstance.
here
you
have
what
appears
to
be
just
a
garden
variety,
wholly
state
law
claim.
the
federal
element
comes
into
it
only
by
way
of
a
res
judicata
preclusion
affirmative
defense,
which
rule
8
(c)
says
it...
suppose
you
never
raise
that
defense.
this
wouldn't...
it
would
still
be
a
claim.
you're
supposed
to
judge
it
from
the
pleading,
from
the
complaint.
if...
you're
not
obliged
to
raise
res
judicata.
it
isn't
the
kind
of
defense
that
a
court
raises
on
its
own
motion,
like
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
so
it's
not
even
in
the
case
until
the
defendant
puts
it
there
and
the
federal
rule
seems
to
say
the
way
it's
supposed
to
come
in
is
as
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
keep
using
collateral
attack
on
bankruptcy
court
order
and
i
keep
thinking,
res
judicata
defense,
district
court
order,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--do
you
get
anything
more
out
of
it
being
in
the
bankruptcy
court
than
in
the
district
court?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
one
question
is
whether
the
federal
court
should
take
a
footnote
and
run
with
it
for
all
its
worth
or
say,
now,
this
was
a
footnote
made
en
passant
so
we
should
be
particularly
careful
about
expanding
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
work
does
that
argument
leave
for
2283,
where
congress
thought
about
relitigating
cases
that
already
had
run
their
course
in
the
federal
court?
it
seems
to
me
that
you'd
never
need...
if
you
have
a
case
going
on
in
the
state
court
you
would
never
need
to
resort
to
2283.
you'd
simply
remove
it
to
the
federal
court.
it's
over.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
give
me
a
case
where
you
could
get
relief
under
2283
but
not
via
this
removal
that
you
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
true
about
2283,
it
has--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
it
doesn't
work
in
diversity
cases?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
if
you
didn't
answer
his
complaint--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--he
would
get
a
default
judgment
under
state
law,
pure
and
simple,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
would
be
no
federal
element
in
that
at
all--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--because
you
didn't
raise...
because
you
didn't
raise
a
defense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
must
come
in
defensively
to
assert
this
protection
of
the
federal
judgment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
there
the
large
difference
that
mr.
odom's
clients
weren't
trying
to
do
anything
under
federal
law?
in
the
moitie
situation
you
have
people
who
brought
a
claim
to
federal
court
and
then
they
bring
the
same
claim
to
state
court.
here,
the...
i
forgot
the
names
of
the
people
involved...
were
not
looking
to
be
in
federal
court
at
all.
they
were
dragged
in
there
because
there
was
a
bankruptcy,
so
it's...
are
the
cases
distinguishable
on
that
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
they
didn't
choose
that
court
to
walk
into.
they
had
in
the
bankruptcy
no
other
choice.
in
the
moitie
case,
here's
parties
who
go
into
a
federal
court
and
then
they
do
the
same
show
over
again
in
state
court.
it
was
their
choice.
they
picked
the
federal
forum
when
they
could
have
picked
the
state
forum.
once
the
bankruptcy
is
ongoing,
these
creditors
have
no
place
else
to
go.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
all
goes
to
the
merits--
