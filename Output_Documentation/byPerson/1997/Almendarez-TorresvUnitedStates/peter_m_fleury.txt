mr.
peter
m.
fleury
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
title
8,
section
1326(a),
provides
for
a
2-year
maximum
penalty
if
these
facts
are
proved:
1)
a
deportation,
and
2)
a
reentry
without
a
deport...
without
permission.
title
8,
1326(b)(2),
on
the
other
hand,
sets
a
punishment
of
up
to
20
years
if
these
facts
are
proven:
1)
a
deportation,
2)
a
reentry
without
permission,
and
3)
an
aggravated
felony
conviction
which
occurred
prior
to
the
deportation.
the
issue
presented
is,
did
congress
intend
for
1326(b)
to
be
a
sentence
provision
or
a
separate
offense?
the
starting
point,
of
course,
is
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
there
are
three
very
important
factors
which
plainly
indicate
that
subsection
(b)
incorporates
by
reference
the
conduct
described
in
subsection
(a)
rather
than
setting
forth
the
sentence
for
a
conviction
in
subsection
(a).
the
first
phrase
that
helps
us
is
1326(b).
it
says...
is
in
1326(b)
which
says,
in
the
case
of
any
alien
described
in
such
subsection,
and
then
it
says,
in
that
case
if
the
person
has
a
prior
aggravated
felony,
he'll
be
facing
a
20-year
maximum.
it
specifically
does
not
say,
in
the
case
of
any
alien
convicted
in
such
subsection
and,
as
this
court
said
in
the
sedima
case,
when
congress
intended
that
the
defendant
had
been
previously
convicted,
it
said
so
by
using
explicitly
words
like
convicted
or
conviction.
here
we
have
no
such
word,
so
what
subsection
(b)
does
is
incorporate
by
reference
the
conduct
set
forth
in
subsection
(a),
that
you
have
to
have
a
deportation
and
a
reentry
without
permission.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
that's
describing
the
result
of
the
process,
not
the
person
in
subsection
(a).
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
that
is
in
subsection
(a),
but
if
you
take
that
clause
that
i
just
read,
the
person
described
in
subsection
(a),
and
you
add
to
it
the
clause
that
precedes
it,
where
it
says,
notwithstanding
subsection
(a),
which
the
government
itself
concedes
as
a
must,
that
that
means
despite
subsection
(a),
which--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--no.
what--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--you
have
to
re
add
words
to
the
statute
to
get
to
that
result,
which
is
the
opposite--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--first,
as
to
the
notwithstanding
question,
if
subsection
(b)
was
to
be
a
penalty
or
a
sentence
for
subsection
(a),
it's
the
opposite
word
that
you
would
use.
you
would
say,
the
penalties
in
subsection
(a)
are
a
result
of
the
conviction...
i
mean,
the
penalties
in
subsection
(b)
are
a
result
of
the
conviction
in
subsection
(a),
not,
notwithstanding
or
despite
the
conviction
in
subsection
(a).
it's
the
opposite
signal
one
would
give
to
say
that
(b)
flows
from
or
is
a
result
of
(a).
secondly,
as
to
the
word
penalty,
the
word
penalty
by
itself
is
a
very
little
evidence
that
what
congress
intended
was
a
sentence
provision.
penalty
is
the
word
signifying
the
result
that
will
occur,
not
whether
or
not
how
you
get
there
is
through
a
trial
of
an
offense,
or
at
a
sentence
proceeding.
penalty
and
sentence
proceeding
are
not
synonymous
phrases.
congress,
when
they
enacted
in
1952
this
very
statute,
1326,
before
the
(b)
part
was
even
thought
of,
enacted
it
in
chapter
8
of
the
immigration
&
nationality
act
entitled,
penalties.
the
house
report
to
that
statutory
provision
referred
to
the
1326(a)
as
creating
a
sanction
for
certain
deported
aliens.
the
word
penalties
is
the
way
anybody
would
describe
the
creation
of
a
new
criminal
law.
if
you
wanted
to
pass
a
law
against
jay
walking
you
would
say,
i
want
to
make
a
penalty
against
jay
walking,
and
you
would
describe
it
as
such,
just
as
congress
did
when
they
described
the
car
jacking
statute.
it
was
under
a
subtitle
called,
enhanced
penalties
for
auto
theft,
or
federal
penalties
for
armed
robberies.
numerous
statutes
are
found
under
a
heading
with
penalties.
it
would
be
a
different
thing
all
together
if
there
was
subsection
(a),
offense,
subsection
(b),
penalty.
in
1988,
when
congress
passed
1326(b),
as
the
government
points
out
in
their
brief,
the
phrase
penalty
was
not
added
to
the
statute.
that's
just
in
the
codification
that
you
see
when
you
pick
up
a
book.
that
was
not
a
congress...
the
codifiers
added
that,
not
congress,
so
the
word
penalty
did
not
become
part
of
the
statute
at
all,
much
less...
even
if
it
had
meaning
as
a
signal
as
to
whether
or
not
it's
a
sentence
provision
or
an
offense.
and
third,
in
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
it
would
make
no
sense
for
the
phrase
in
(b)(1)
that
you
can
get
up
to
a
10-year
sentence
for
a
felony,
and
then
in
parentheses,
other
than
an
aggravated
felony.
how
would
that
make
any
sense
if
that's
a
sentence...
if
that's
just
a
sentence
proceeding,
because
it
would
just
be
a
gradation.
all
of
the
courts
below
are
uniform
in
looking
at
a
statute
and
seeing...
if
congress
had
passed
1326(b)
and
simply
added
that
language
to
an
already
existing
1326(a)
right
at
the
end,
and
just
said,
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony
and
shall
suffer
a
penalty
of
up
to
10
years,
or
a
term
of
imprisonment
of
up
to
10
years,
and
if
they
have
an
aggravated
felony
it
will
be
up
to
20
years,
or
if
it's
just
a
felony
it
will
be
up
to
10
years,
that
would
be
a
signal
that
there's
a
sentence
provision
for
the
offense
in
(a).
but
making
it
a
separate
subsection
is
deemed
by
all
of
the
courts
that
review
this
as
an
indicator
that
it's
an
offense,
especially
when
it's
not
section
(a)
entitled
penalties,
which
it's
not.
then
when
we--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--my
point
was
that
in
looking
at
whether
or
not
something
is
titled
penalties,
if
it's
in
a
separate
subdivision,
like
in
section...
18
u.s.c.
section
1091,
which
says
(a),
basic
offense,
(b),
penalty
for
basic
offense,
then
that's
a
signal
that
(b)
is
to
be
a
sentence
provision.
but
where
it's
all
in
one
section,
courts
of
appeals
have
said
as
to
that
factor,
not
the
end
result
but
as
to
that
factor,
that
is
an
indication,
if
the
penalty
provision
is
in
the
same
paragraph
as
the
offense,
then
it's
a
sentence
for
the
offense,
but
if
it's
separated
out
into
a
separate
section
without
a
separate
title
of
penalty,
then
that's
an
indicator...
it
may
not
be
dispositive...
an
indicator
that
it's
meant
to
create
a
separate
offense.
such
as
in
2113(d),
which
is
the
bank
robbery
statute,
and
2113
sets
forth
(a)
that
it's
a
crime
to
commit
a
bank
robbery,
and
you
can
get
up
to
20
years.
(d),
if
you
use
a
weapon
or
assault
somebody
in
the
course
of
committing
(a),
then
it's
an
extra
5
years,
and
this
court
in
the
simpson
case
assumed
that
was
an
element,
and
even
though
it
was...
it...
just
as
in
this
statute
incorporated
by
reference
all
of
the
provisions
of
the
previous
statute.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
well,
what--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--well,
if
it
was
a
sentence
provision,
then
it
would
just
say
in
gradations,
(a),
if
you've
got
a
felony
conviction
you'll
get
up
to
10
years.
if
it's
an
aggravated
felony
you'll
get
up
to
20
years.
but
if
you
put
in
the
word,
other
than
an
aggravated
felony,
it
takes
care
of
a
due
process
concern...
i
mean,
a
double
jeopardy
concern.
you
could
only
get
convicted
under
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2),
because
a
felony
could
fall
under
both
statutes,
but
if
you
add
the
clause,
other
than
an
aggravated
felony,
then
you
can
only
be
convicted
under
(b)(1)
and
not
(b)(2),
otherwise
there's
no
sense
to
having
that
clause
in
there.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
yes,
but
there
would
be
no
reason
to
put...
it
would...
you
could
only
be...
you
can
only
get
up
to
10
years
if
it
was
a
felony
and
only
up
to
20
years
if
it
was
an
aggravated
felony,
with
or
without
that
clause,
but
it
does
satisfy
double
jeopardy
concerns
if
you
view
these
as
offenses.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
no,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary.
if
my
client
has
a
felony
and
they
don't
prove
it's
an
aggravated
felony,
he
could
only
get
up
to
10
years,
whether--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--sure--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
for
sentencing
concerns,
because
again,
if
it's
not
an
aggravated
felony
it
still...
it's...
if
it's
an
aggravated
felony,
it
would
be
a
felony,
and
that
might
raise
double
jeopardy
concerns
if
these
are
offenses,
which
is
our
view
they
are,
because
if
it
doesn't
say
other
than
an
aggravated
felony,
there
might...
it
might
not
survive
the
blockburger
test,
so...
but
that
is
not
one
of
our
more
important
points.
more
importantly,
subsequent
enactments
indicate
clearly
that
congress
viewed
these
as
creating
separate
offenses.
in...
when
they
created
1326(d),
they
referred
to...
when
they
created
1326(d),
they
made
it
crystal
clear,
because
they
say
that
you
cannot
contest
the
validity
of
a
deportation
order
under
certain...
under
(a)
or
(b)(1).
well,
if
you
have
a
trial,
and
the
government
proves
the
person
has
been
deported
and
has
reentered
subsequent
to
that
deportation,
the
deportation
order
issue
will
already
have
been
resolved
by
the
time
you
get
to
a
sentence
proceeding.
there
would
be
no
need
for
congress
to
refer
to
(d)(1),
saying
you
can't
contest
a
deportation
order
under
(b),
when
they
created
1326(d),
because
the
issue
would
never
arise.
also,
they...
there
is
no
word,
deportation
order,
or
order
of
deportation,
in
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2).
therefore,
that
indicates
congress
assumed
that
(a)
was
incorporated
by
reference
into
(b).
then
they
created
sections
1326(b)(3)
and
(b)(4),
both
of
which
clearly
appeared
to
be
offenses,
and
they
put
them
in
with
(b)(1),
(b)(2),
(b)(3),
and
(b)(4),
all
of
which
are
offenses.
they
didn't
separate
those
out
into
a
separate
subsection
from
(b)(1)
and
(b)(2).
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
the
consequence
of
a
reversal
is
a
2-year
maximum
penalty
in
this
case
to
my
client.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
because
it
wasn't
in
the
indictment.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
i'm
not...
i
didn't
understand
the
question
with
regard
to
he
would
be
convicted
of
two
offenses.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
mm
hmm.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
subsection
(a)
would
be
a
lesser
included
offense
of
(b)
necessarily.
it
would
not
survive
the
blockburger
test
because
there's
no
element
in
(a)
that
does
not
also
exist
in
(b),
therefore
only
one
conviction
could
be
had,
but
the
value
is
clear,
as
the
amicus
brief
indicates,
to
the
defendant.
most
of
the
prosecutions
under
1326
are
in
the
ninth
circuit
alone.
there's...
60
percent
of
the
cases
under
this
statute
are
in
the
ninth
circuit
alone,
which
covers
more
cases
than
all
of
the
other
circuits
combined.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
yes.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
correct.
i
think
it's
a
clear
application
of
the
blockburger
test,
and
(a)
is
a
subset
of
(b),
and
therefore--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--i
don't
know.
all
i
know
in
this
case,
the
law
in
our
circuit
was
clear
that...
vasquez
olvera
had
already
been
handed
down
years
before,
and
it
was
the
clear
rule
in
our
circuit
that
my
client
would
be
exposed
to
punishment
up
to
20
years.
all
the
parties
acted
on
that.
i...
we
objected
at
the
sentence
hearing
as
we
did.
we
followed
the
procedure
in
vasquez
olvera.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
as
to
the
law?
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
there
was
a...
an
inclusion
in
the
factual
resume
which
was...
which
is
designed
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
rule
11
factual
basis
that
he
had
three
prior
convictions--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--some...
those
convictions.
it
wasn't
explained,
or
the
court
did
not
do
a
colloquy
as
if
those
were
elements.
he
listed
the
elements
being
the
1326(a)
elements.
he
didn't
ask
if
he
had
a
prior
aggravated
felony
conviction.
he
didn't
ask
whether
he
had
a
felony
conviction.
he
just...
it
was
just
in
the
resume.
the
judge
didn't
even
ask
about
the--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--and
they
wouldn't
have
to
present
it
to
a
grand
jury,
and
i
would
point
out
with
regard
to
that,
as
i
said,
the
ninth
circuit
has
the
majority
of
these
prosecutions.
as
the
government
itself
said
in
their
reply
to
our
cert
petition
the
government
has
had
no
problem
complying
with
the
rule
in
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
yes,
they
have.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
that
is
correct.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
correct.
he--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--that
was
the
settled
law
in
our
circuit.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
there...
the
question
is
whether
or
not--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--this
indictment
charged
him
with
an
offense
that
exposed
him
to
anything
more
than
2
years,
because
if
it
did
not,
then
the
most
he
could
get
under
this
is
2
years,
and
we're
not
asking
for
a
retrial,
and
we've
never--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--contested
the
validity
of
the
plea.
we're
saying
he
pled
guilty.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
it
recited
the
elements
of
1326(a),
that
a
person
was
found
in
the
united
states,
he
hadn't
had
permission
to
reenter,
and
he
had
been
deported,
and
it
referred
to
just
1326
generally,
but
it
did
not
have
any
reference
to
an
aggravated
felony
conviction.
the
plea
colloquy
didn't
have
any
reference
to
an
aggravated--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--we
had
no
plea
agreement.
it
was
just
a
plea,
and--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--right.
right.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
there's
no
question
that
he
admitted
that
he
had
a
burglary,
that
he
had
prior
burglary
convictions.
he
was
not
told,
if
you
have
an
aggravated
felony
conviction
your
sentence
range
will
turn
on
that,
your
sentence...
your
statutory
sentence
maximum
will
be
increased
turning
on
that
fact,
and
he
was
not
asked
whether
he
had
an
aggravated
prior
conviction.
he
was
just...
it
was
just
included.
oftentimes
in
our
district
they
do
include
the
person's
record
in
the
factual
resume.
the
import
of
that
was
in
no
way
part
of
the
plea
colloquy.
but
in
any
event,
the
issue
is
whether
or
not...
if
it's
an
offense,
it
doesn't
matter,
because
it
has
to
be--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--correct.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
oh--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--my
proposed...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
the
reverse,
i
think.
under
the
government's
reading,
how
would
a
judge
know
how...
how
would
a
trial
judge
know
how
to
give
the
range
of
punishment
if
it's
not
in
the
indictment?
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
in
this
case
it's
not...
we've
never
challenged
the
validity
of
the
plea.
the
government's
never...
they
didn't
rely
to
their
detriment
on
our--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--oh--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--correct.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
correct,
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
there
is
a
statute
in
title
18
in
which,
depending
on
the
sentence
result,
you
could
get
up
to
6
months,
or...
another
one
is
up
to
2
years,
and
the
judge
wouldn't
know
until
the
end
of
the
process
whether
or
not
you
needed
an
indictment
in
the
first
place
or
whether
or
not
a
jury...
the
defendant
was
entitled
to
a
jury
trial
until
the
end
of
the
process,
not
at
the
beginning.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
yes,
but
i
think
before
we
get
to
the
constitutional
argument
i
would
say
that
at
the
very
least,
since
this
raises
constitutional
arguments,
you
need
a
clear
statement
from
congress
that
they
intended
to
raise
these
constitutional
arguments
or
infringe
upon
the
constitutional
right
to
a
grand
jury
indictment
and
proof
of
the
facts
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
as
i
understand
the
court's
question,
it's
why
am
i
not
concerned
that
inclusion
of
the
prior
conviction
would
prejudice
my
client
in
a
trial.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
as
pointed
out
in
the
amicus
brief,
98.2
percent
of
these
cases
end
up
in
a
plea
of
guilty,
and
in
the
ninth
circuit,
as
the
amicus
points
out,
the
government
and
the
courts
do
not
mind
the
fact
that,
with
the
glut
of
cases
that
could
be
prosecuted
under
this
statute,
that
there's
a
certain
degree
of
charge
bargaining,
and
therefore
some
prosecutorial
discretion
over
which
of
the
two
offenses
to
charge
to
dispose
of
the
case,
and
in
many
cases,
in
this
particular
case
it
would
benefit
my
client
and,
of
course,
it
would
benefit
a
number
of
clients
throughout
the
land,
most
of
the
clients.
secondly,
under
the
old
chief
case,
any
prejudice
to
my
client
would
be
blunted
if
that
were
the
issue,
and
thirdly,
if
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
this
is
the
same
person
who's
been
previously
convicted,
my
client
or
any
client
would
rather
have
that
issue
litigated
under
the
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
when
18
additional
years
turns
on
a
resolution
of
that
fact.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
my
understanding
of
the
old
chief
is,
the
jury
would
not
get
to
hear
the
conduct
that
resulted
in
the
conviction,
or
what
the
conviction
was
for.
he
could
just
simply
stipulate
that
he
has
a
prior
conviction.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
correct,
because
under
old
chief
that
would
have...
the
relevance
of
that
would
be
outweighed
by
the
prejudicial
nature
of
the--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--right.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
that's
correct.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
some
they
do--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--and
sometimes
not.
it
depends.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
right.
they
would
have
to
redo
the
whole
process.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
yes.
it
would
render
the
plea
invalid.
they
couldn't
give--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--yes,
in
total
from
the...
and
they'd
have
to
start
all
over,
which
is
not
the
most
judicially
economic
way
to
proceed.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
yes,
i
think
it...
it
happens--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--i
don't
know
how
often
it
happens.
i
don't
have
an
empirical
study
on
that.
but
i
know
it
has
happened.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
yes.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
mm
hmm.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
right.
the
charging
decision,
the
prosecution
will
be
left
with
no
charging
decision
whether
or
not
to
proceed
under
(a)
or
(b),
and
so
therefore
simply
charging
the
elements
of
the
offense
in
(a),
which
has
a
2-year
maximum,
could
lead
to
the
exposure
of
up
to
a
20-year
maximum
based
on
facts
that
nobody
knew
about
at
the
plea
hearing
or
contemplated
when
the
plea
was
entered,
and
a
whole
new
plea
hearing
will
have
to
have...
to
occur
under
that
circumstance.
another
factor
that
indicated
congress
did
recognize
that
they
had
created
an
offense
is
when...
in
1996,
when
they
created
a
law
and
told
the
sentence
commission
that
they
needed
to
increase
the
penalties
for
the
offenses
in
1326(b).
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the...
in
mcmillan
and
in
patterson
there
was
a
clear
statement
that
those
legislatures
intended
the
fact
at
issue
there
not
to
be
an
element,
and
that
was
a
big
part
of
this
outcome
of
both
of
those
cases.
in
this
case
we
have
no
such
clear
statement,
and
in...
both
in
mcmillan
and
in
patterson
the
court
looked
to
the
fact
that
congress
deemed
the...
whether
or
not
congress
had
deemed
the
fact...
the
facts
that
the
jury
did
find
to
be
so
important
to
create
a
liability
for
the
statutory
maximum
punishment,
and
since
the
jury
did
find
all
of
those
facts,
the
outcome
was
within
the
dictates
of
the
constitution.
here
we
have
the
question
left
unresolved,
and
that
is
whether
a
fact
upon
which
an
additional
18
years,
dwarfing
the
possible
consequences
to
my
client
other
than
that
resolution
of
that
fact
is
to
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
here
we
do
not
have
what
was
present
in
patterson
and
in
mcmillan.
we
don't
have
the
type
of
clear
statement
from
congress
as
they
did
in
21
u.s.c.
841,
where
they
have
(a),
unlawful
acts,
(b),
penalties,
and
21
u.s.
851,
which
sets
forth
a
sentence
procedure
in
order
to
determine
the
prior
convictions
that
might
be
used
to
increase
the
statutory
maximum
sentence
under
841,
where
congress
has
said
as
clearly
as
they
could
that
the
prior
convictions
in
841
(b)
will
be
sentence
enhancements
for
a
conviction
under
(a).
that's
not
present
in
this
case.
the
traditional
rule
is
that
prior
convictions
used
to
increase
a
statutory
maximum
must
be
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
this
court's
never
said
otherwise.
in
oyler--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--we...
in
a
footnote
we
cited
numerous,
numerous
cases.
that
was
the
rule
at
common
law,
and
that
was
the
rule
well
into
the
20th
century
until
very
recently
in
statutes
like
841
and
the
like.
it
hasn't
changed.
that
was
the...
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
uniform
rule.
as
some
of
the
cases
say,
the
precedents
for
this
are
too
numerous
to
cite.
that
was
the
traditional
rule.
in
addition
to
this,
this
is
not
a
recidivist
statute.
a
recidivist
statute
is
something
where
it
says,
well,
if
you
do
something
and
you
do
it
again
you'll
get
extra
penalties.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
oh,
correct.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
but
it
requires
a
prior
aggravated
felony
which
occurred
prior
to
the
deportation,
and
it
has
to
do
with
somebody
who
reenters
with
the
status
of
a
felon,
just
like
18
u.s.c.
922(g)
is
concerned
with
the
status
of
the
person.
it
says,
we
want
to
have
increased
deterrence
to
keep
felons
away
from
weapons,
and
therefore
it's
an
offense
for
a
felon
to
have
a
weapon.
here,
we...
congress
said,
we
want
to
have
an
increased
deterrence
for
felons
who
don't
even
belong
in
this
country.
therefore,
it's
an
extra
offense,
it's
a
20-year
offense
for
you
to
come
into
this
country,
and
that
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
alleged
to
the
jury.
in
this
case
we
don't
have
any...
we
have
no
indication
that
the
constitutional
right
to
have
a
grand
jury
to
decide
whether
a
20-year
offense
should
have
been
filed
in
this
case,
it
did
not
occur.
that
was
not
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
and
that's
the
purpose
of
the
grand
jury
right.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
that
presents
a
much
more
difficult
question
at
least
in
the
drug
cases
in
21
u.s.c.
841.
you
do
have
what
was
present
in
mulaney...
in
patterson
and
mcmillan.
you
have
the
clear
statement,
and
so--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--in
our...
in
my
view
there
is,
but
again--
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
--yes.
mr.
peter
m.
fleury
yes,
that
is
correct,
but
again...
and
21
u.s.c.
841
would
present
that
issue
clearly
because
there
is
a
clear
statement
that
that's
what
congress
intended.
