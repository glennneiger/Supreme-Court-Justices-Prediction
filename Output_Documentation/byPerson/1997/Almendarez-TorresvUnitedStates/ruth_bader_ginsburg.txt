justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
not
following
your
argument
all...
about
all
of
the
courts
of
appeals,
because
i
thought
that
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
only
one
interpreting
this
statute
as
established
in
a
separate
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
fleury,
would
you
explain
to
me
the
consequences
of
accepting
your
position
in
two
respects.
one
is,
there
was
here,
if
i
have
it
right,
no
debate
about
defendant's
prior
convictions.
he
conceded
that
the
recitation
of
his
prior
conviction
was
true
and
correct.
so
in
light
of
that,
that
there
was
nothing
to
go
to
the
jury
on
it,
he
had
a
prior
conviction,
he
admitted
it,
what
is
the
consequence
of
a
reversal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
it
wasn't
in
the
indictment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now,
if
it
had
been
in
the
indictment,
and
given
the
certainty
of
the
conviction,
i...
the
defendant
would
end
up
with
two
offenses
which
would
place
the
defendant
in
jeopardy
of
a
three
strikes
and
you're
out,
closer
to
the
three,
so
why
is
it
in
defendant's
interest
to
have
this
as
a
separate
offense
rather
than
an
enhancement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
if
you...
you
take
your
case.
you
say,
there
are
two
separate
offenses,
that
merely
coming
back
once
you've
been
thrown
out
is
an
offense.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
a
separate
offense
is
coming
back
after
you've
committed
a
felony,
been
convicted,
and
then
been
deported.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
telling
me
that's
for
sure
that
you'd
end
up...
on
your
view
of
the
case
you
can
only
have
the
one
conviction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
would
not
be
convicted
separately
of
(a)
and
(b),
so
you
wouldn't
have
two
strikes
against
you,
only
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
you
said
that
one
of
the
principal
advantages
of
the
position
you're
taking
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
defendant
is
the
plea
bargaining
with
the
prosecutor.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
prosecutor
says,
i'm
going
to
charge
only
under
(a),
not
(b),
so
the
prosecutor
must
know
at
that
stage
about
the
conviction,
and
if
i
have
you
right--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--if
the
interpretation
of
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong
and
the
other
circuits
are
right,
then
there
is
no
discretion.
the
judge
can't
say,
well,
there
was
an
aggravated
felony
but
i'm
going
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
many
of
these
cases
go
to
trial?
very
few,
don't
they?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
as
far
as
identification
is
concerned
you
have
usually
the
mug
shots
and
the
fingerprints.
what
else?
