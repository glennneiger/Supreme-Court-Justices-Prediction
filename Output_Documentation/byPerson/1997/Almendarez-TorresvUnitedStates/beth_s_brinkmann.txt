ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
1326,
subsection
(b)(2),
is
a
sentencing
enhancement
provision.
it
does
not
create
a
separate
criminal
offense.
congress
enacted
(b)(2)
as
part
of
a
three
tier
penalty
scheme
for
violations
of
section
1326.
the
statutory
text,
structure,
and
history
compelled
that
conclusion,
and
that
interpretation
does
not
create
a
constitutional
problem.
subsection
(a)
of
section
1326
sets
forth
the
offense
conduct.
it
also
sets
forth
a
base
sentence
of
up
to
2
years
that
shall
be
imposed
on
such
an
offender,
but
specifies
that
that
provision,
that
you
shall
be
sentenced
to
2
years,
is
subject
to
subsection
(b).
subsection
(b)
then
states
that
notwithstanding
subsection
(a),
longer
sentences
are
authorized
in
some
cases.
(b)
does
not
set
forth
any
additional
offense
conduct.
specifically,
(b)(2)
authorizes
a
sentence
up
to
20
years
for
persons
with
aggravated
felony
convictions,
a
paradigmatic
sentencing
factor.
the
reading
of
(b)(2)
is
confirmed
by
the
circumstances
surrounding
its
enactment.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
the
provision
in
the
enacting
legislation
was
entitled,
criminal
penalties.
that
was
not
carried
over
into
the
codification,
but
it
is
part
of
the
legislation
that
was
enacted
by
congress.
moreover,
if
i
could
draw
the
court's
attention
to
the
version
of
the
statute
in
effect...
it's
in
the
appendix
to
the
government's
brief
at
2a.
pages
2a
and
3a
reflect
the
changes
from
the
1952
version
to
the
version
which
enacted
in
1988
that
added
subsection
(b).
petitioner's
counsel
discussed
at
length
the
fact
that
subsection
(b)
applies
notwithstanding
subsection
(a)
into
the
case
of
any
alien
described
in
such
subsection.
at
the
time
that
provision
was
added,
congress
was
looking
at
(a),
which
stated
at
that
time
that
an
offender
shall
be
guilty
of
a
felony
and,
upon
conviction
thereof,
be
punished,
so
it
was
quite
natural
for
congress
to
use
that
language
at
that
time.
as
petitioner
points
out
in
his
brief,
later
that
guilty
of
a
felony
provision
was
dropped
out.
that
was
part,
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
part
of
an
effort
of
congress
going
through
and
changing
fine
provisions
and
various
provisions
of
the
immigration
act.
but
at
the
time
that
(b)
was
enacted,
to
refer
to
an
alien
that
was
described
in
(a),
it
was
clearly
an
alien
who
was
guilty
of
a
felony
and
who
would
be
subject
to
a
sentence
of
2
years
unless
(b)
applied.
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
also
confirms
that.
as
we
discuss
in
our
brief,
all
the
references
to
the
subsection
(b)
that
was
added
were
penalty
provisions.
the
sponsors
of
the
bill
referred
to
it
that
way,
the
section
by
section
analysis
that
was
submitted
to
the
senate,
and
the
predecessor
statute,
the
sponsors
and
drafters
had
discussed
at
length
the
fact
that
this
was
a
three
tier
penalty
scheme.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
i
meant
before
when
i
explained
that
this
was
the
paradigmatic
sentencing
factor.
that
is
by
proof
of--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
a
couple
of
responses.
as
a
threshold
matter,
we
would
disagree
that
sentencing
enhancements
do
not
often
increase
the
statutory
maximum.
in
fact,
they
do,
and
we
discussed
the
early
recidivist
cases
from
this
court,
where
it
makes
clear
that
that
is
not
a
constitutional
problem.
graham
v.
west
virginia
was
the
first
case
in
1912
that
talked
about
the
fact
that
prior
convictions
used
for
sentencing
enhancements
are
not
an
offense.
they
are
a
distinctive
factor.
they
can
be
determined
at
a
separate
hearing.
and
in
oyler
v.
boles,
an
early
1960's
case,
there
were
two
defendants
at
issue
there.
both
of
them
for
their
instant
offense
were
subject
to
much
lower
than
the
enhanced
sentence.
mr.
oyler
i
believe
was
facing...
he
had
a
second
degree
murder
conviction
and
he
was
facing
a
period
of,
i
think
it
was--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--maximum--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
they
also
discussed
the
fact
that
he
had
a
maximum
of
18
years,
and
his
went
to
a
mandatory
life.
also,
mr.
crabtree
in
that
case
had
a
maximum
of
10
years
and
it
went
to
life,
so
we
think
that
that
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
court
has
long
recognized
that
the
fact
that
a
sentencing
consideration
enhances
the
maximum
is
not
a
constitutional
problem.
i
would--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
the
question
in
that
case
would
be,
what
was
the
legislative
intent?
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
and
i--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--the
second
factor
that
your
honor
introduces
is
the
fact
of
the
death
penalty,
and
different
procedural
protections
of
this
court--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--you're
eliminating
most
of
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes,
we
think...
i
guess
the...
to
address
that
question,
i
guess
i
would
like
to
address
what
the
court
said
in
mcmillan,
suggesting
that
there
is
a
case
over
the
line
where
there
is
some
constitutional
limit.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
i
think
one
thing
that
mcmillan
makes
clear,
that
it's
not
simply
the
length
of
the
sentence.
the
example
that
the
court
in
mcmillan
gave
was
a
statute
in
which
the
presumption
of
innocence
was
undermined
because
of
the
elements
that
were
shifted
to
the
sentencing
proceeding.
there
was
an
old
case,
i
believe,
where
there
was
a
presumption
that
the
gun
had
traveled
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
court
gave
that
as
an
example
in
mcmillan
of
something
that
would
be
on
the
other
side
of
the
line.
also
in
mcmillan,
i'd
like
to
point
out,
the
court
cited
with...
favorably
lower
court
rulings
that
had
upheld
the
constitutionality
of
the
old
special
offender
statute.
the
third
circuit
davis
case
the
court
cites
favorably
and
discusses
it
as
that's
the
lower
court
authority
to
look
to
that's
citing
the
cases
in
discussing
3575.
3575
also
includes
the
maximum
authorized
sentence.
that
statute
permitted
the
sentence
to
go
up
to
25
years.
in
the
davis
case,
setting
aside
that
sentencing
enhancement,
he
was
facing
a
maximum
statutory
sentence
of
2
years.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
think
in
light
of
all
of
the
other
factors
in
this
case
it
would
be.
again,
i
think
it's
a
totality.
when
the
court
is
discerning
legislative
intent
here
we
just
believe
it's
abundantly
clear,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
factor
would
make
any
difference
in
this
particular
case.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
may
have
misunderstood
the
question.
i
apologize.
i
think
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
there
may
be
situations
certainly
under
the
court's
recent
decisions
of
witt,
or
watts,
where
sentencing
proceedings
include
consideration
of
relevant
conduct
or
acquitted
conduct,
uncharged
conduct.
i
don't
see
that
that
raises
a
constitutional
area.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
the
court
made
clear
in
oyler
it
raised
it...
it
was
a
check
forgery
case.
mr.
crabtree
was
facing
a
check
forgery
case,
and
because
he
had
had
three
prior
convictions
under
that
base
sentence
he
would
have
been
facing
2
to
10
years.
it
was
a
mandatory
life
sentence
in
that
case.
i
think
also
i
want
to
distinguish,
your
honor,
between
notice
of
what
the
penalty
is
and
what
the
claim
is
in
this
case.
the
claim
is
in
this
case
there
was
a
constitutional
violation
because
this
was
not
alleged
in
the
indictment
and
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
at
trial.
sentencing
enhancements
do
not
need
to
be
included
there.
that
does
not
mean,
however,
that
it's
not
clear
that
congress
intended
a
person
to
commit
this
offense,
be
criminally
sanctioned,
and
persons
who
commit
this
offense
with
this
prior
criminal
history
be
subject
to
the
sanctions.
that's
clear
on
the
face
of
this
statute.
the
statute
gives
full
notice
of
that.
those
penalties
are
not
required
to
be
included
in
an
indictment.
i
think
what
the
court
was
focused
on
before
helps
in
that
regard,
rule
11.
that
is
the
rule
that
requires
that
criminal
defendants
be
notified
prior
to
a
guilty
plea
of
the
maximum
sentence.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
rule
11
colloquys
trial
judges
often
will
explain
that
i
can't
be
certain
about
your
sentence,
particularly
under
the
guidelines,
and
even
when
they
talk
about
statutory
maximum
in
drug
cases
they
explain
enhancement
provisions
that
do
increase
that
maximum--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--although
i
think
it
would--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
but
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
have
a
knowing
and
voluntary
plea,
your
honor,
and
i'd
also
point
out
under
rule
11
subsection
(h)
there's
a
harmless
error
analysis.
for
example,
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
one
of
the
examples
they
give
of
harmless
error
is
a
guilty
plea
proceeding
in
which
the
trial
judge
erroneously
understates
the
maximum
penalty.
if
the
penalty
imposed
in
that
case
did
not
exceed
that,
that
would
be
harmless
error.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
there
was,
we
point
out
in
our
brief
that
actually
at
the
rule
11
it
said
10
years
and
in
fact
under
the
statute
could
have
been
20
years,
but
because
petitioner's
sentence
imposed
was
ultimately
below
10
years
there's
no
problem
with
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
we
don't
believe
the
constitutional
issue
does
arise
in
this
case.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
the
court
did
avoid
that
very
question
in
mcmillan,
i
would
point
out.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
two
things.
i
also
think
it's
been
resolved
by
cases
since
mcmillan.
in
two
death
penalty
cases
this
court
has
upheld
the
death
penalty
sentencing
schemes
in
the
state
of
florida
and
arizona,
and
in
both
those
schemes
the
existence
of
an
aggravating
factor
is
the
fact
that
makes...
that
increases
the
maximum
sentence
to
the
death
penalty
in
hildwin
and
walton,
and
in
hildwin
the
court
specifically
said
that
mcmillan
does
not
change
that
result.
it
was
referring
back
to
its
results
in
spaziano
upholding
judge
sentencing--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--and
judge
determination
of
those
factors.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
i'd
have
to
respectfully
disagree.
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
how
those
sentencing
systems
worked.
in
fact,
once
you're
convicted
of
the
offense...
it's
called
a
capital
offense,
just
like
this
would
be
a
1326
offense,
but
you
cannot
be
sentenced
to
death
in
those
states
unless
after
that
verdict
there
is
then
a
finding
of
the
existence
of
an
aggravating
factor,
and
that
aggravating
factor
is
what
then
permits
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
in
the
zant
case--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
it
certainly--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
certainly
supports
our
position,
however,
your
honor
that
there's
no
constitutional
requirement--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--there's
no
constitutional
requirement
that
a
factor
that
is
so
significant
to
increasing
the
maximum
sentence
needs
to
be
alleged
in
an
indictment
or
proven
at
trial.
it
just
does
not
need
to
be.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
this
indictment
charged
petitioner
with
violation
of
1326.
when
you
look
at
the
statute
1326,
it
is
clear
that,
depending
on
what
your
criminal
history
is,
you
can
get
up
to
2
years,
up
to
10
years,
up
to
20
years.
that's
clear,
just
as
if
you
read
the
death
penalty
statute,
you
read
1326--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
clear
what
the
possible
penalties
are.
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
in
the--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no.
it's
in
the
joint
appendix
on
page
3.
it
specifically
cites
section
1326.
i
would
also
point
out,
regarding
earlier
questions
from
the
court,
that
the
factual
resume
that
was
signed
by
petitioner,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
is
also
in
the
joint
appendix
on
pages
5
to
7,
and
in
that
it
lists
the
three
burglary
convictions
that
were
used
as
enhancement,
and--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
that
was
simply
the
statutory
provision
at
issue
there,
and
if
there's
one
thing
that
we've
learned
in
preparing
for
this
case,
there's
a
wide
variety
of
recidivist
statutes
both
in
the
federal
and
state
systems,
different
language,
different
structures,
and
i'd
have
to
get
back
to
the
court's
opinions
in
spaziano
and
walton
and
hildwin,
where
the
court
made
clear
that,
even
in
the
case
of
an
aggravating
factor
in
a
death
penalty
statute,
that's
a
sentencing
provision
and
it
does
not
need
to
be
determined
by
a
jury.
i
think
spaziano
is
dispositive
on
that
point.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
those
are
sentencing
enhancements,
your
honor.
they're
set
out
under
841
(b).
it's
captioned
penalties,
and
there's
a
whole
variety
of
factors
that
are
sentencing
enhancements
under
that.
it's
not
just
the
nature
and
quantity
of
the
drugs
involved,
but
again
it's
also
the
prior
criminal
history
of
the
defendant,
and
in
subsections
(b)(1)(b)(c),
and
(d)
those
statutory
maximum
authorized
sentences
are
also
increased
based
on
the
prior
conviction.
(b)(1)(a)
it
doesn't
happen
in
because
the...
without
any
prior
convictions
the
maximum
is
life,
but
under
(b)(1)(b)
the
maximum
is
30
years,
and
if
you
have
a
prior
conviction
it's
40
years,
and
if
you
have
a
prior
conviction
it's
life,
so
that
also
is
a
common
feature
of
841
(b),
and
the
use
of
prior
convictions
there.
we
also
have
a--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i'm
sorry.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
that
practice
has
varied
over
time
and
over
districts.
i
believe
in
some
districts
they
do
include,
for
example,
sentence...
citations
to
sentencing
statutes
also.
it's...
i
don't
think
that
there's
a
uniform
rule
on
that.
i
would
also
point
out,
though,
just...
our
concern
is
not
with
other
statutes
in
this
case,
it's
with
the
fact
that
for
10
years,
nearly
10
years,
the
government
has
interpreted
this
according
to
what
we
think
the
clear
intent
of
congress
is,
section
1326,
and
we...
as
we
said
in
our
opposition
to
the
petition
in
this
case
we
don't
have
difficulty
including
this
in
the
prosecution
in
the
ninth
circuit,
but
we
have
not
proceeded
that
way.
we
do
not
want
to
be
subject
to
collateral
attacks
from
defendants
who
are
under
conviction
from
all
those
other
circuits,
and
we
are
also
put
in
this
ironic
position
of
being
subject
then
to
these
challenges
that
it
will
be
prejudicial.
we
do
not
believe
that
the
old
chief
scenario
would
answer
all
of
the
challenges
we
would
face,
because
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out,
that
simply
sanitizes
the
prior
conviction,
if
you
will.
it
doesn't
eliminate
it.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
actually,
your
honor,
petitioner
was
back
in
the
country
for
years
before
he
was
found.
he...
and
i
think
this
is
pretty
typical.
he
was
found
because
he
was
locked
up
on
other
state
charges.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
exactly,
your
honor,
and
we
would
also--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
easy,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
fingerprints--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--identification
hearings
are
very
easy.
they're
often
held
in
district
court
when
there's
a
transfer
to
another
district
for
a
prosecution.
there
are
all
kinds
of
identity
hearings.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
that
would
be
a
determination
by
the
sentencing
judge.
we
do
also
point
out
concerning
the...
that
the
ease
of
proof,
that
the
first
circuit,
when
the
first
circuit
in
the
forbes
case
was
talking
about
the
potential
prejudice
to
defendants,
also
of
introducing
a
prior
conviction,
also
pointed
out
the
ease
of
this
proof
and
the
fact
that
congress
has
demonstrated
a
policy
of
not
having
prior
convictions
admitted
during
criminal
trials
that
are
irrelevant
to
that
as
a
matter
of
course.
that
was
one
of
the
congressional
policies
that
the
first
circuit
looked
to
in
its
holding.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i
would
think
identification
numbers
on
their...
the
ins
has
identification
procedures,
alien
numbers,
prior
cases
that
that
alien
was
involved
with.
i
would
think
oftentimes
but
not
always
the
prior
deportation
will
have
been
a
direct
result
of
the
prior
conviction,
so
that
also
will
be
a
package
of
identifying
information
about
this
particular
defendant,
because
the
conviction
of
many
felonies
obviously
is
grounds
for
deportation.
if
there's
nothing
further,
your
honor,
we
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
should
be
affirmed.
