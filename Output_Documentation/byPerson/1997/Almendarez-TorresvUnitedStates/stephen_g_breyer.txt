justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
explain...
why
is
that?
i
understand
how
it
would
benefit
your
client
in
this
case.
really
what
(b)
does
is,
it
explains
to
the
jury
if
it's
in
the
indictment
that
this
person,
namely
the
defendant
in
front
of
you,
not
only
was
deported
previously,
but
he's
a
very
bad
guy.
now,
why
is
it
that
the
defense
bar,
putting
your
hat
on
as
a
defense
attorney,
thinks
it's
better
to
have
that
placed
in
front
of
the
jury
before
the
trial
than
it
is
to
have
it
placed
before
the
judge
after
the
trial.
it
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
details
that
he
was
arrested,
deported
before,
and
came
back.
it
has
to
do
with
what
kind
of
person
this
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
or
if
not,
you
have
a
particular
client
you're
representing
very
well.
i'm
interested
in
the
defense
in
general,
the
defense
bar
in
general,
why...
i
want
to
see
why
they've
taken
this
position.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
sure
on
that
one,
because
there's
been
no
trial
or
conviction
of
the
previous
commission
of
a
felony.
i
mean,
i
think
what
justice
stevens
is
driving
at
is
that
you
then
have
to
have
a
whole
trial
as
to
what
the
person
had
done
previously.
did
he...
three
times,
did
he
in
fact...
was
he
a
felon
or
not?
did
he
murder
somebody?
you
know,
try
it
before
the
judge.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
is
it
the
case...
suppose
we
held
against
you
in
this
case.
what
would
that
do
to
the
drug
statutes?
my
impression
is
the
drug
statutes
are
phrased
in
terms
of
a
crime,
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
and
there
follows
a
very
large
section
called
penalties
which
gives
different
statutory
penalties
ranging
from
a
year
to
life,
depending
on
the
amount
of
the
drug.
now,
is
it
the
case
that
those
reviewed
by
the
department
normally
are
simply
sentencing
enhancements,
or
are
they
viewed
as
part
of
the
substantive
crime?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
your
view
that
also
all
these
things
in
the
drug
statute
have
to
be
submitted
to
grand
juries...
amounts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
a
constitutional
problem
there?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
in
your
view
it
might
be
unconstitutional--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--to...
and
therefore
all
the
amounts
would
have
to
be
submitted
to
grand
juries
and
in
the
indictment,
too.
