well,
doesn't
that
very
clause
naturally
refer
to
the...
to
your
maximum
penalty
in
(a)--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--notwithstanding
that
penalty,
here's
another
penalty
if
these
facts
are--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
i
don't
think
so.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
a
pretty
normal
reading,
and
i
think
we're...
another
factor
is
that
the
titles
to
subsection
(b)
make
reference
to
penalties,
and
all
the
amendments
to
it
refer
to
penalties.
they
don't
refer
to
a
new
separate
crime.
i
don't
know
why
those
aren't
indicators
for
us
that
this
really
is
a
sentence
enhancement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
the
other
circuits,
other
than
the
ninth,
have
all
found
it
to
be
a
sentencing
enhancement
provision,
haven't
they?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
the
ninth
is
the
one
circuit
that
has
adopted
the
view
that
you
espouse
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
this
case
the...
your
client
acknowledged
at
the
hearing
on
the
plea
agreement
that
he
was
subjecting
himself
to
the
10-year
penalty
and
so
forth.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
factual
admissions
of
the
other
crimes
were
made
before
the
plea
agreement
hearing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
before
the
hearing
on
the
plea,
these
factual
allegations
of
the
prior
convictions
had
been
made,
and
the
defendant,
your
petitioner,
had
signed
it
and
accepted
it
as
being
true.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
there
is
no
question
here
that
all
of
this
was
in
the
record.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
would
the
government,
if
there
were
an
identification
problem,
call
the
jury
in
and
ask
them
to
make
that
determination?
