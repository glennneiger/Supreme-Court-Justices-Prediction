well,
if
they
fail
to,
and
it
later
turns
out
that
in
fact
there
is
this
evidence
of
prior
conviction
and
so
on,
they
can
simply
go
back
and
do
it
again.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
they
could
do
that.
i
mean,
if
it...
it
wouldn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
not,
but
as
you
point
out,
this...
i
thought
you
were
indicating
earlier
this
isn't
likely
to
happen
very
often.
i
mean,
they...
or
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
government
wakes
up
at
the
last
moment,
suddenly,
to
this
news?
doesn't
the
government
normally--
justice
david
h.
souter
there
was
no
indication
in
the...
i
don't
have
the
indictment
in
front
of
me--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there
was
no
indication
in
the
indictment
that
it
was
(a)
rather
than
(b)?
justice
david
h.
souter
you
couldn't
tell?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
brinkmann,
may
i...
do
i
understand
from
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
that
it
is
in
fact
the
justice
department's
practice
not
to
charge
amount?
justice
david
h.
souter
when
they
draw
up
the
indictments
the
justice
department
does
not
include
a
charge
of
the
amount
of
the
drugs
in
the
statement
of
the
charge?
