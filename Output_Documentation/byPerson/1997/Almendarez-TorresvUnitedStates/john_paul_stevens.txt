justice
john
paul
stevens
can
you
tell
me
if
in
the
plea,
the
hearings
when
the
judge
takes
the
guilty
plea,
does
the
judge
in
a
case
with
an
indictment
like
this
one,
which
is
unclear
as
to
whether
it
covers
both
(a)
and
(b),
does
the
judge
routinely
ask
the
defendant
about
the
prior
convictions
to
get
that
on
the
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
it
clear
at
the
time
of
the
plea
hearing,
or
at
the
time
of
the
sentencing
hearing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
i
understand
the
statement
of
fact...
pardon?
the
statement
of
facts
about
his
prior
history
was
subsequent
to
the
plea
of
guilty,
wasn't
it,
or
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that...
the
scenario
that
i
haven't
quite
thought
through
is,
supposing
you
have
an
indictment
like
this,
a
colloquy
in
which
the
defendant
acknowledges
he
came
in,
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
and
then
subsequently
the
government
learns
that
there
were
the
three
prior
convictions
before
sentencing,
and
they
go
into
the
judge
and
say,
we've
just
learned
that
he
qualifies
under
(b)
so
we
want
a
20-year
sentence.
that
would
be
permissible,
as
i
understand
it,
under
the
government's
view,
and
they
wouldn't
have
to
prove
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they'd
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--a
prior
sentence,
so
the
routine
would
be
a
plea
hearing
that
advised
the
defendant
in
all
(a)
cases
that
the
maximum
penalty
is
20
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
they
do
that
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
bet
they
don't.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
to
be
sure
i
understand
the
posture
of
the
case,
the
case,
the
hypothetical
case
that
troubles
me
is
one...
unlike
this
case.
i
guess
the
facts
were
pretty
clear...
one
in
which
at
the
time
of
the
indictment
and
the
plea
hearing,
all
the
government
knows
is
that
this
particular
reentry
was
made
unlawfully,
but
the
government
is
not
aware
of
prior
convictions,
and
as
i
understand
the
government's
position,
if
they
subsequently
discover
before
sentencing
the
prior
felony
the
sentence
could
go
up
to
20
years.
now...
and
supposing
the
defendant
says,
no,
that
was
my
brother
or
somebody
else,
it's
mistaken
identity...
and
our
cases
do
have
some
claims
of
mistaken
identity...
i
take
it
it's
your
position
that
the
government
must
prove
that
this
particular
person
was
the
same
one
by
only
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
normally
it's
a
paradigmatic
sentencing
factor
that
does
not
increase
the
range
of
punishment
beyond
the
previous
maximum,
which
was
true
in
mcmillan,
for
example.
that
was
within
the
statutory
range.
here,
if
you...
well,
that's
the
argument,
i
guess,
whether
the
maximum
for
everybody
is
20
years,
or
only
for
those
who
find
this
out
later.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wasn't
the
argument
in
that
case
that
it
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--double
jeopardy
to
do
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mcmillan
said
it
was
when
the
tail
wags
the
dog,
and
the
question
was
whether
20
years
is
the
tail
or
the
dog,
as
compared
to
2
years.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
to
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's...
supposing
this
statute,
instead
of
reading,
whose
deportation
was
subsequent
to
a
conviction
for
three
or
more,
it
simply
said,
whose
deportation
was
subsequent
to
the
commission
of
three
or
more
crimes.
it
would
still
be
a
sentence
enhancement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
clear
that
in
this
particular
case
there's
no
problem,
but
we're
concerned
about
the
possible
other
cases,
and
you
called
my
attention
to
oyler
v.
boyles,
and
i
notice
the
opinion
makes
this
point:
the
statute
expressly
provides
for
a
jury
trial
on
the
issue
of
identity
if
the
accused
either
denies
he
is
the
person
named
in
the
information
or
just
remains
silent,
so
apparently
the
court
thought
that
when
an
identity
is
in
question
it
might
be
a
matter
of
some
significance.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
can't
imagine
the
prejudice
argument
is
very
important.
aren't
most
of
these
cases,
the
factual
scenario,
pretty
simple?
they
pick
up
the
person
when
he's
crossing
the
border
or
something,
he's
found
in
the
united
states
in
violation
of
(a).
can't
involve
much
of
a
trial
very
often.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
it
easy
when
he
denies
that
he's
the
same
person?
but
this
guy
didn't
deny
it.
i
know.
it's...
i'm
just...
this
is
an
easy
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question
is,
what
does
the
statute
mean
for
cases
that
are
not
so
easy?
