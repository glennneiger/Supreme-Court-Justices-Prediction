we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-6839,
hugo
roman
almendarez
torres
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
fleury.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
could
also
say
that
the
person
described
in
subsection
(a)
shall
be
fined
under
title
18
or
imprisoned
not
more
than
2
years
or
both.
it's
describing
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
in
subsection
(a),
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
so
what
is
there
left
to
try?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--what
did
the
indictment
recite?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
would
any
damage
to
your
client
be
blunted
under
your
understanding
of
the
old
chief
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
government
wouldn't
be
entitled
to
go
to
the...
to
show
the
jury
what
the
convictions
were
for?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
very
interesting.
may
i
ask
about
the
rule
11
point
that
justice
kennedy
raised?
if
you
had
a
fact
situation
in
which
all
that
was
known
was
the
facts
establishing
a
violation
of
subsection
(a),
and
there's
no
sentencing
contemplated,
i
suppose
the
judge
would
have
a
duty
of
explaining
that
there
is
a
range
of
punishment
up
to
20
years
for
a
violation
of
subsection
(a)
in
every
case,
because
they
wouldn't
know...
they
would
not
put...
they
could
not
avoid
the
possibility
that
they
would
prior
to
sentencing
later
discover--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
fleury.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
brinkmann,
isn't--
--do
you
have
any
question
as
to
the
validity
of
the
rule
11
hearing
before
us
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
the
violation
of
(b)
would
be
even
easier
to
prove.
i
mean,
there
you're
not
talking
with
any
acts,
or
something
like
that.
you're
simply
talking
about
a
judgment
of
conviction
that's
introduced
from
some
other
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
fleury,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
source
of
your
traditional
rule?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
don't
have
to
do
the
same
thing
again
for
a
recidivist
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
this
is
a
form
of
recidivist
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fleury.
the
case
is
submitted.
