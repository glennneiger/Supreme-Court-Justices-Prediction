justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you
can
only
be
sentenced
under
(b)(1)
or
(b)(2)
also,
under
that...
as
it
now
stands,
as
the
government--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
the
clause
could...
even
if
this
is
a
sentencing
provision
the
clause
is
necessary,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
the
whole
point
is
they
want
to
distinguish
between
aggravated
and
nonaggravated
felonies
for
sentencing
purposes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
have
to
have
that
parenthetical
or
something
equivalent
to
it
in
the...
in
(b)(1).
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
before
we
leave
the
plea
colloquy,
i'm
looking
at
rule
11,
does...
rule
11
requires
that
the
judge
set
forth
the
range
of
sentencing,
does
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
your
proposed
rule
would
serve
no
notice
function
in--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
plea
context,
or--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
am
i
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
the
rule
11
colloquy's
inadequate,
then
there's
an
invalid
plea.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
saying
that
there's
no
notice
problem
because
if
the
judge
doesn't
adequately
advise
the
defendant--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
rule
11
colloquy,
then
the
plea
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--must
be
set
aside
in
any
event.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
the
government
thinks
that
there's
just
a
2-year
case
before
it.
it
doesn't
have
the
evidence
that
justice
stevens
referred
to
of
these
other
convictions,
and
the
district
judge
says,
i
want
you
to
know
that
the
maximum
penalty
is
20
years.
is
that
a
correct
rule
11
advice,
or
should
he
say
2
years?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course
here--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--here
he
would
have
to
give...
you
have
to
give
the
minimum
as
well.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
here
the
minimum
would
be
10
or
20.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
brinkmann,
isn't
the
fact
that
we've
had
a
fairly
serious
colloquy
here
about
the
problem
of
when
enhancements
and
enhancing
factors
become
so
radically
important
that
they
perhaps
ought
to
be
treated
for
constitutional
purposes
have
to
be
treated
as
changes
of
elements
rather
than
merely
the
addition
of
sentencing
factors
a
good
reason
for
us
in
effect
to
rule
against
you,
because
if
we
rule
your
way
we're
going
to
have
to
decide
and
i
suppose
come
up
with
some
standard
to
say
when
enough
becomes
too
much,
and
when
we
in
fact
pass
into
a
constitutionally
suspect
area,
and
we
ought
to
avoid
those
kind
of
rulings
if
we
can.
and
i
would
suppose
that
if
we
at
least
find
arguments
each
way
on
what
congress
intended,
that
we
ought
to
rule
against
you
to
keep
this
constitutional
issue
out
of
the
case.
isn't
that
fair?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
may
not
arise
in
this
case,
but
in
order
to
decide
this
case
i
suppose
we
will
have
to
say
when
it
would
arise
in
order
to
conclude
that
it
doesn't
here,
so
i
don't
see
how
we
can
avoid
facing
it.
they've
raised
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
maybe
it's
time
to
stop
sort
of
sticking
our
head
in
the
sand,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
other
side
has
raised
this
issue,
and
i
don't
see
how
we
can
avoid
it
if
we
go
your
way.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
in
those--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
all
of...
yes,
but
in
all
of
those
cases
there
was,
if
i
understand
what
your
argument
is
there's
a
fact
that's
different
from
the
case
here.
in
all
of
those
cases
you
were
dealing,
ab
initio,
with
capital
cases
in
which
the
capital
result
was
a
possibility.
it
was
part
of
the
range
to
which
the
defendant
was
exposed.
the
argument
here
is
that
the
sentencing
factor,
or
that
the
enhancement
factor,
as
you
put
it,
actually
increases
the
range,
so
that
the
death
penalty
cases,
i
suppose,
would
not
be
authority.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--death
is
different,
to
quote
a--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--yes,
but
it's
a
narrowing
in
those
cases--
--give
her
a
chance.
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
in
those
cases,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
there
was
a
narrowing
going
on.
in
this
case
there's
an
expansion
going
on.
