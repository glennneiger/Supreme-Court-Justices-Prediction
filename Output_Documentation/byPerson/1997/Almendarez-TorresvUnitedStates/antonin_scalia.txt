justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fleury,
would
you
go
back
over
your
argument
about
the
parenthetical
other
than
an
aggravated
felony?
i
didn't
follow
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--argument
on
that.
that
doesn't
suggest
anything
to
me.
what
does
it
suggest
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fleury,
you
made
a
constitutional
argument
in
your
brief.
are
you
going
to
address
that
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
do
you
apply
that
to
all
situations?
i
mean,
i'm
not
outraged
when
you
apply
it
to
prior
criminal
conviction,
i
guess,
but
suppose
congress
passed
a
classic
malice
murder
statute
and
it
says,
the
maximum
penalty
shall
be
life
in
prison
provided
that
if
the
murder
is
committed
with
malice
aforethought
it
shall
be
death.
now,
is
that
a
sentencing
enhancement,
so
you
need
only
a
judge
determination
of
by
more
likely
than
not
of
the
malice
aforethought
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
make
it
very
clear.
the
sentencing
shall
be
increased
from
life
imprisonment
to
death
if
there
has
been
malice
aforethought.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
10
years
to
life.
[laughter]
this
sentence
shall
be
increased
from--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
there
is,
and
i'd
like
to
know
your
judgment
as
to
what
the
line
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
that
doesn't
increase
the
sentence.
when
you
commit
the
crime
you
know
that
if
worst
comes
to
worst
you'll
get
30
years,
and
within
that
30
years
the
judge
is
allowed
to
find
on
the
basis
of
probabilities
that
you
had
committed
another
crime,
and
he
may
increase
your
sentence
up
to
the
maximum
of
30
years
because
of
that.
but
we're
talking
here
about
you
commit
the
crime
in
good
faith,
thinking
you
can
get
only
30
years,
and
it
turns
out
that
there's
a
sentencing
enhancement
that
turns
it
into
a
50-year
one,
and
the
judge
is
going
to
make
that
determination
on
his
own
by...
you
know,
more
likely
than
not
that
you
committed
this
earlier
crime.
you
think
that's
constitutional,
raising
it
from
30
to
a
50
maximum?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
did--
--all
of
that
has
been
done
to
comply
with
our
ruling
that
you
must...
you
cannot
apply
the
death
penalty
automatically
and
you
must
allow...
there
must
be
aggravating
factors
to
narrow
the
class,
and
that's
a
consequence
of
our
constitutional
ruling,
which
arguably
is
satisfied
by
a
judge
determination.
to
reason
backwards
from
that
to
what
the
common
law
requires
with
respect
to
conviction
or
sentencing
for
felonies
is...
doesn't
seem
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
they
fingerprint
him.
