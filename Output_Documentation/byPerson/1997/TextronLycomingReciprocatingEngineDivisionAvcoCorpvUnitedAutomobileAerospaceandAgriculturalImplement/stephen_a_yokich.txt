mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
our
view
of
possible
mootness
is
that
there
is
a
fair
question
of
mootness
in
this
case
because
the
contract
has
expired,
but
that
this
is
a
situation
that
is
a
labor
case,
the
labor
cases
tend
to
resolve
themselves
quickly
and
that
therefore
it's
a
situation
that's
capable
of
repetition,
evading
review.
in
that
respect,
we
think--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
we
hope
that
textron
would
not
fool
this
local
twice,
but
we
do
think
that,
given
the
fact
that
we
have
several
thousand
collective
bargaining
agreements
and
almost
a
dozen
with
textron,
that
it
could
come
up
again,
and
that
this
is
a
case
very
similar
to
the
burlington
northern
case,
where
there
was
a
strike
that
was
resolved
by
an
emergency...
a
presidential
emergency
board.
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
that
was
a
situation
capable
of
repetition,
even
though
the
parties
were
thereafter
bound
to
a
certain
term,
and
even
though
the
parties
might
not
ever
have
that
situation--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--but...
well,
that
is
true
also,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
we
indicate
in
our
brief,
these
contract
formation
issues
come
in
many
different
forms.
you
could
have
a
situation
where
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
minds,
where
there
wasn't
offer
and
acceptance,
all
of
those
types
of
situations
could
be
repeated
also,
and
bring
this
case
back
before
the
courts
and
in
such
a
time
frame
as
to
make
it
impossible
for
this
court
to
resolve
the
issue.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
i
think
that's
a
fair
argument
and--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
i--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--i
have--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
you'll
have
to
find
somebody
different
than
me
to
do
it.
that's--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--i
think
it's
a
decent
argument.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
yes.
as
i
say,
there
are
lots
of
implications
to
it,
because
it
turns
on
the
nature
of
the
right
in
this
particular
contract
what
the
bargaining
history
is,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
all
of
the
factual
questions
that
you
have
to
answer
in
a
case
like
litton,
and
that's
why
i'm
not
prepared
at
this
time
to
say
absolutely
positively
this
contract's
created
a
vested
right.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
that's
what
we
indicate
in
footnote
4
of
our
brief
and--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--that
is
why
this
case
as
a
whole
is
not
moot.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i...
what
i'm...
the
reason
why
i
bother
with
it
is
just
that
i'm
trying
to
cover
all
the
bases.
you
could
draw
a
distinction
between--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--no.
my
number
1
reason
that
the
case
is
not
moot
is
set
out
in
footnote
4
of
our
brief,
which
is
that
there's
this
live
damage
claim.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
that's
an
argument
that
i
would
rank
after
repetition
evading
review,
and
i
would
just
that
when
you
bargain
a
new
contract
you
typically
bargain
from
the
baseline
of
the
old
contract,
and
if
there's
a
provision
in
that
contract
that
for
some
reason
doesn't
apply
because
of
fraud,
you
can
make
an
argument
that
you
would
have
less
moral
ability
or
more
moral
ability
at
the
bargaining
table
to
say
we
don't
have
to
bargain
about
that,
or
we
should
bargain
from
zero
instead
of
the
old
language.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i
think
there
is
a
potential
impact
of
that
declaration.
i
think
mr.
dyk's
argument
about
the
vested
rights,
i
think
the
point
about
the
fraud,
and
i
think
about
the
capable
of
repetition
evading
review
are
all
stronger
arguments.
since
lincoln
mills
v....
since
textile
workers
v.
lincoln
mills
this
court
has
held
that
section
301
gives
the
responsibility
to
the
federal
courts
to
fashion
a
body
of
law
for
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
in
the
lincoln
mills
case,
the
court
rejected
a
literal
reading
of
the
statute.
it
rejected
a
reading
that
the
statute
was
jurisdictional
and
instead
found
that
the
statute
created
the
power
to
develop
a
whole
body
of
cases
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
contracts.
in
addition
in
lincoln
mills,
the
court
held
that
the
statute
gave
the
federal
courts
a
wide
choice
of
remedies,
remedies
such
as
specific
performance
in
that
specific
case
and,
in
addition
to
that,
remedies
such
as
declaratory
judgments.
in
lincoln
mills,
for
example,
specific
performance
was
a
remedy
that
you
can't
find
in
the
language
of
section
301
and
is
one
that's
really
been
traditionally
disfavored
in
terms
of
agreements
to
arbitrate
and
disfavored
in
terms
of
employment
law.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
i
would
say
that...
well,
lincoln
mills'
reading
of
the
jurisdictional
grant
was
a
fair
one
based
upon
that
language.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
i
think
lincoln
mills
said
that
the
phrase,
for
violation
of
contracts,
is
a
broad
enough
phrase
so
that
the
courts
have
the
responsibility
to
develop
a
complete
body
of
law
with
respect
to
the
enforcement
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
i
think
what
lincoln
mills
says
is
that
when
we
have
issues
that
deal
with
what
the
rights
and
the
duties
are
created
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
the
federal
courts
are
authorized
to
adjudicate
those
rights
and
duties.
i
think
the
phrase,
for
violation
of,
can
argu...
should
be
read
as
giving
the
federal
courts
general
jurisdiction
over
the
law
of
collective
bargaining
ag
reements--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
i'd
rank
it
way
up
there
on
top.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
and
i
suppose
that
the...
what
it
comes
down
to
on
our
view
in
terms
of
looking
at
the
language
of
the
statute
that's
involved
is
what
you
use
the...
what
the
word
for,
the
preposition
involves.
we
think
the
word
for
is
susceptible
of
a
broad
enough
meaning,
that
being
concerning
or
related
to,
which
you
can
find
in
the
dictionary,
in
the
definition
for
for,
that
the
court
has
considerable
latitude
to
resolve
issues
that
go
to
the
heart
of
the
enforcement
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i
think
it
would
be
a
proper
response
to
some
claims.
if
the
complaint
was
wholly
based
upon
an
alleged
unfair
labor
practice
i
think
that
might
be
a
proper
response.
i
don't
think
that's
the
case
in
our
situation,
because
i
think
if
you
compare
the
theory
of
our
case
versus
the
board's
theory
of
their
complaint,
they're
different
cases.
our
case
goes
to
the
entire
contract
and
is
based
upon
the
common
law
of
fraud.
the
board's
case
is
really
a
little
bit
different
than
that.
the
board
argues
that
it
was
a
mandatory
subject
and
that
the
parties
did
not
bargain
in
good
faith
over
that
mandatory
subject,
and
that
the
subcontracted
clause
that
would
let
the
board...
that
would
let
the
employer
proceed
on
that
subject
was
procured
by
fraud,
and
so
the
fraud
really
comes
in,
in
the
board's
theory
at
least,
in
the
tail
end
of
the
case
as
opposed
to
being
the
heart
of
the
refusal-to-bargain
complaint.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
that,
your
honor.
if
it's
a
permissive
subject--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--if
it's
a
permissive
subject
their
duty
is
to
supply
information--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--i
don't
know
of
any
board
cases
that
give--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--i
don't
know
of
any
board
cases
that
give
relief
in
that
situation,
and--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
the
closest
the
board
has...
the
relief
that
we
seek
in
this
case
is
to
be
able
to
declare
the
entire
contract
unenforceable.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
and
i
don't
know
of
any
board
cases
that
deal
with
that
exact
situation,
and
that
say
that
you
can
award
that
kind
of
relief.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
representing
the
union,
the
best
i
could
do
is
predict
that
that
would
be
a
very
tough
case
before
the
board.
there
aren't
any
cases
that
i
could
supply
to
the
board
to
support
that.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
the
cases
the
petitioner's
brief
relies
on,
first
of
all
they
all
deal
with
mandatory
subjects
where
the
employer
had
an
obligation
to
bargain
about
them.
second,
if
you
look
at
the
most
recent
case,
the
waymouth
case,
it
speaks
of
a
particular
commitment
that
was
made
in
a
contract
that
has...
that
was
held
not
to
be
binding
upon
the
union.
it
was
a
case
where
the
union
said,
if
you
move
to
another
site
this
contract's
not
going
to
cover
us
representing
the
people
at
the
other
site.
the
employer
misled
the
union
about
where
it
was
moving
to,
and
the
board
said,
well,
you
can't
enforce
that
specific
term
of
the
contract,
and
again
that's
very
much
consistent
with
the
board's
theory
in
this
case,
which
goes
to
a
specific
term
of
the
contract
rather
than
the
enforceability
of
the
entire
agreement.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i...
not
only
do
i
read
the
statute
that
way,
but
i
think
that
that
is
the
thrust
of
the
board's
precedent
from
lincoln
mills
onwards.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
the
nlrb?
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i
think
it
has
very
little
authority
to
construe
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
for--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--if
i
said
that--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--that's
correct.
i
misspoke.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i
think
that
the
entire
thrust
of
this
court's
cases
is
to
give
section
301
a
broad
reading.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
mm-hmm.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--the...
i
think
that
the
expansive
nature
of
the
jurisdictional
grant
comes
as
you
develop
the
other
cases
that
deal
with
section
301.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i'm
not
trying
to
argue
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that
i
think
that
the
courts
in
lincoln
mills
read
the
language,
did
not
apply
it
literally
to
just
give
them
jurisdiction,
applied...
read
the
language
to
give
them
the
authority
to
develop
a
whole
body
of
contract
law,
and
our
argument
is
that
our
claim
in
this
case
that
a
part
of
the
inducement,
like
other
contract
formation
claims,
fits
within
the
whole
body
of
contract
law.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
there
are
arbitration
cases
where
this
is
put
in
as
a
defense
to
the
enforcement
of
a
specific
term
of
the
contract.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
arbitration
cases
that
throw
out
a
whole
contract
because
of
a
claim
of
voidance
of
this
kind.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
there
are...
let
me
divide
that
into
two
parts.
there
are
federal
court
cases
that
deal
with
enforcements
of
agreements
to
arbitrate
that
deal
with
the
issue
of,
can
that
agreement
be
enforced
due
to
the
fraud,
and
quite
honestly
there's
a
mish-mash
of
the
cases.
they
go
different
ways.
there
are
cases,
for
example,
in
the
fifth
circuit
that
say
that
if
an
issue
of
fraud
is
raised,
then
that's
something
the
court
has
to
determine
before
it
can
order
the
case
to
arbitration
and
that,
of
course,
is,
one
thing
that
would
happen
were
this
case
to
go
back
down
is
that
the
district
court
would
have
to
consider
the
company's
additional
defense
that
this
case
has
to
be
arbitrated.
that
was
reserved
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
is
something
that
would
be
currently
before
the
district
court.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
i
think
that
your
reaction
to
mr.
dyk's
argument
that
this
is
really
a
ripeness
argument
is
the
correct
way
to
analyze
that
problem,
and
i--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--and
i
don't
think
i'd
lose
on
the
ripeness
point,
and
that's
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
i
think
that
all
of
the...
that
a
decision
on
what
we
plead
can
be
determined
by
historical
facts.
either
the
fraud
occurred
or
it
didn't.
it
depends
on
who
said
what
to
whom
when,
and
because
there
is
no
other
event
that
really
has
to
happen
to
determine
whether
the
fraud
occurred,
i
don't...
i
think
this
is
a
situation
that
is
eminently
ripe
for
judicial
resolution.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i
think
that
that
goes
to
the
issue
of
whether
a
judgment
would
fix
the
legal
rights
of
the
parties,
and
i
think
that
a
judgment
would
fix
the
legal
rights
of
the
parties,
because--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
i
think
that
the
parties
in
this
case
are
in
an
adversary
contest.
we
say
there
was
fraud,
they
say
there
wasn't
any
fraud.
we
say
the
contract's
not
enforceable,
they
say
the
contract
is
enforceable,
and
i
think
the
fact
that
we
didn't
write
them
a
letter
before
we
filed
the
lawsuit,
that
we
let
the
lawsuit
be
our
indication
that
we
thought
the
contract
could
be
rescinded,
i
think
that's
sufficient
to
put
us
in
a
posture
where
we
are
adverse
and
where
the
decree
could
be
meaningful.
if
the
decree
did
issue,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
this
contract
could
be
rescinded,
then
what
would
happen
was
that
the
parties
would
say,
boy,
we'd
better
go
back
to
the
bargaining
table
and
try
to
remedy
this
problem,
and
so
the
decree
that
the
court
would
issue
would
give
concrete
legal
guidance
to
the
parties.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
we...
i
don't
think
i--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--right.
the
only
place
where
we
have
said
that
we
think
the
contract
is
void
is
in
the
two
legal
proceedings,
in
the
legal
proceeding
before
the
nlrb
and
in
the
legal
proceeding
before
the
district
court.
we've
not
otherwise
made
that
threat.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
that
is
our--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--we
don't...
i
don't
think
we
have
to
go
that
far.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
on
an
issue
of
this
nature--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--where
it's
solely
determined
by--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--historical
fact,
i
would
say
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i
don't
think
it's
justiciable
absent
some
claim
that
the
contract
was
not
binding
and
absent
all
of
the
facts
necessary
for
a
court
determination
on
that
claim
existing,
and
so
just
a
naked
claim,
we
want
to
know
whether
it's
enforceable,
is
not
enough.
if
there
was
a
claim
that
there
was
no
meeting
of
the
minds,
or
that
the
figure
in
the
contract
for
rent
was
the
wrong
figure,
i
think
that
is
justiciable.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i
think
that's
right,
and
that's
why
i
think
it's
important
that
when
you
construe
the
word
for,
that
you
construe
it
as
meaning
concerning,
and
that
when
you
look
at
what
are
the
issues
the
federal
courts
have
looked
at
with
respect
to
concerning,
you
see
the
whole--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
i...
what
we're
asking
for
is
a
declaration
that
the
contract's
not
enforceable,
that
if
we
commit
a
breach,
that
it's
not
a
violation,
and
i
would
argue
to
the
court
that
we've
done
all
we
need
to
do
to
indicate
to
the
other
side
that
we
think
that
there's
a
substantial
issue
that
we
disagree
with
them
on
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
we
can
violate
the
contract.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
it's
a
procedural
device
that
let's
a
person
who
expects
that
they
will
be
a
defendant
get
into
court
first
to
get
a
declaration
so
that
they
don't
have
to
risk
the
consequences
of
a
breach.
in
this
type
of
situation,
i
think
where
you
have
very
large
consequences
from
a
breach,
where
you
have
an
impact
on
the
employer
if
there's
a
strike,
where
you
have
an
impact
on
the
union,
and
where
you
could
have
very,
very
substantial
impacts
on
the
membership
of
the
union,
it's
entirely
appropriate
to
not
put
the
union
to
the
point
where
it
has
to
say,
this
is
void
or
we're
going
on
strike
tomorrow.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
no.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
because
our
view
of
section
301
is
that
it
creates
a
complete
jurisprudence
of
section
301.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
i...
let
me
step
back
for
a
second.
we
could
have
gone
into
state
court,
but
it
would
have
been
under
section
301
and
it
would
have
been
limited
to
whatever
this
court
would
hold--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--excuse
me?
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
what
the
court
held
in
avco
was
that
a
state
court
breach
of
contract
claim
was
something
that
arose
under
section
301
and
was
therefore
removable,
and
as
a
consequence,
if
you
go
into
state
court
on
a
breach
of
contract
claim
it's
going
to
be
determined
by
the
same
standards
that
this
court
uses
under
section
301.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
and
i
think
that
reading
dowd
box
and
avco
together
means
that
if
it
relates
to
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
you
use
the
federal
law
under
section
301.
you
can
use
it
in
either
federal
or
state
court,
but
if
one
party
wants
to
remove,
then
you're
in
federal
court.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
in
the
case...
you
see,
and
i
guess
that--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--that
goes
to
the
point
that
they're
making
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
our
position
on
that
is
that
their
analysis
of
section
301
doesn't
really
do
a
very
good
job
of
explaining
how
that
would
work,
and
that's
because
presumably
if
you
went
into
state
court
you'd
be
governed
by
state
rules
of
procedure,
and
you
could
have
a
state
declaratory
judgment
act
that
was
broader
or
narrower
than
the
federal
declaratory
judgment
act
in
terms
of
what
types
of
violations
you
could
bring
before
the
court.
and
if
that's
the
case,
if
section
301
is
less
than
complete
in
terms
of
the
jurisdiction
it
gives
the
courts
over
issues
of
contract
enforceability,
you
have
a
situation
where
you
could
have
state
court
actions
that
are
entirely
undermining
the
principle
of
uniformity
under
section
301.
now,
if...
and
you
know,
their
argument
doesn't
account
for
many
different
things.
it
doesn't
account
for
what
happens
if
it's
a
permissive
subject
and
the
board
concededly
has
no
authority
whatsoever,
garmon
preemption
couldn't
apply
in
that
case,
and
it
also
doesn't
account
for
the
fact
that
there
are
some
contract
formation
issues
that
might
not
get
you
in
front
of
the
board.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
and
our
position
on
that
is
that
so
long
as
the
court
can
find
section
301
jurisdiction
we
would
continue
to
live
in
this
world
where
we
have
concurrent
remedies.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
and
that's
because
we've
had
declaratory
judgments
in
the
federal
courts
in
labor
cases
for
over...
for
almost
40
years
now.
the
first
reported
case
that
i
can
find
is
the
black
and
clawson
case
in
1962,
and--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--to
the
regional
director,
yes.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well,
if
you
look
at
the
circuits
where
the
courts
have
acknowledged
that
lawsuits
like
this
one
can
go
forward,
i
don't
think
you
can
find
any
evidence
that
there
are
dozens
and
dozens
and
dozens
of
cases
where
the
parties
are
exercising
both--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
the
tenth
in
mcnalley,
the
ninth
in
rozay's
and
in
wilson,
the
first
has
hinted
at
that
in
a
recent
case,
but
the
seventh
would
almost
certainly
say
it.
the
third
would,
and
the
second
circuit
would
also
say
it,
too,
under
black
and
clawson
and
kozera
and
messenger,
which
means
i
think
in
the
majority
of
places
we
already
have
the
potential
that
they're
talking
about,
and
it's
hard
to
identify
a
great
number
of
cases
going
into
the
court
that
deal
with
these
types
of
issues.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
well--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
again,
in
terms
of
the
affirmative...
in
terms
of
employers
doing
this
i
think
the
same
analysis
applies,
because
i
think
we've
had
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
these
types
of
contract
formation
issues
for
many
years
in
many
places,
and
we
haven't
seen
this.
i
guess--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
it
doesn't
bother
me
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
it
might
bother
me
in
mack
trucks,
but--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--well,
i
think
that
because--
mr.
stephen
a.
yokich
--in
most
places
that's
already
possible.
we've
accepted
the,
sort
of
the
run
of
the
courts
in
that,
and
as
a
consequence
we
want
to
establish
the
proposition
that
it
can
be
used
affirmatively
as
well,
and
that
is
what
we're
trying
to
do
here.
i
think
the
best
answer
to
this
argument
is
in
the
third
circuit
where
the
decision
in
mack
trucks
came
down
10
years
ago,
where
it's
a
decision
that's
pretty
closely
on
point
and
correctly
decided,
and
where
you
really
don't
see
a
lot
of
these
cases
arising.
one
case
came
up
recently
called
the
beverly
case,
and
the
third
circuit
didn't
have
any
problem
in
saying,
in
that
case,
because
all
the--
