mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1994,
the
petitioner
employer
and
the
respondent
union
in
this
case
engaged
in
collective
bargaining
required
by
the
national
labor
relations
act
and
by
the
decisions
of
the
national
labor
relations
board.
and
the
union
alleges
that
in
the
course
of
that
bargaining
the
employer
failed
to
supply
information
that
it
was
obligated
to
supply
concerning
subcontracting
plans,
one
of
the
questions
being
whether
that
was
a
mandatory
or
permissive
subject
of
bargaining
under
the
act.
and
the
union
first
brought
its
claim
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
alleging
that
the
employer
had
committed
an
unfair
labor
practice
by
failing
to
bargain
in
good
faith
under
sections
8(a)(5)
and
8(d)
of
the
act.
and
apparently
dissatisfied
with
the
progress
of
this
complaint
before
the
board,
the
union
then
brought
an
identical
action,
making
exactly
the
same
charges,
seeking
virtually
the
same
relief,
in
federal
district
court
as
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
purportedly
pursuant
to
section
301
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
the
board
proceeding
has
been
tentatively
settled.
a
settlement
was
approved
by
the
regional
director
last
week,
and
the
board
has
granted
limited
relief,
ordering
that
certain
provisions
of
the
contract
be
set
aside
and
awarding
back
pay
but
refusing
to
grant
the
broad
relief
that
the
union
had
requested,
which
would
be
invalidation
of
the
entire
contract.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
contract
has
expired
and
the
parties
are
in
the
process
of
attempting
to
negotiate
a
new
agreement.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
we
think
that
the
matter
should
have
been
resolved
by
the
board
proceedings,
but
as
far
as
the
mootness
of
the
court
proceeding
is
concerned
the
union
still
claims
damages
based
on
the
identical
facts
that
led
it
to
request
the
declaratory
judgment
and
that
issue
would
be
unaffected,
in
the
union's
view,
by
the
board's
settlement.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
there
are
a
variety
of
issues
which
could
arise
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
because,
of
course,
the
effect
of
that
agreement
wasn't
limited
to
the
3-year
period
of
the
agreement,
so
for
all
of
these
reasons
we
think
there's
no
real
issue
of
mootness
in
this
case.
rather,
the
issue
here
is
whether
the
district
court
had
jurisdiction
under
section
301
and,
in
our
view,
the
language
of
section
301
is
quite
plain.
it
provides
for
suits
for
violation
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
there's
no
question
here
of
any
violation.
there's
no
allegation
that
the
employer
has
committed
a
violation
of
the--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
yes,
we
do
agree
that
if
there
had
been
an
alleged
violation
of
the
agreement
and
a
declaratory
judgment
were
sought,
that
there
had
been
no
violation,
that
that
would
be
a
matter
properly
within
the
district
court's
jurisdiction.
of
course,
all
the
parties
agree
here
that
in
the
course
of
that
proceeding
the
law
that
would
be
applied
would
be
board
law,
in
other
words,
the
good
faith
bargaining
requirements
crafted
by
the
board
pursuant
to
the
act,
so--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that's
correct,
and
what
this
court
has
done,
as
we
understand
it,
it
has
said
that
pursuant
to
the
act,
that
you
can
have
an
affirmative
suit
that's
brought
in
the
courts
or
an
unfair
labor
practice
charge
before
the
board
that
may
involve
defenses,
defenses
before
the
board
concerning
contracts,
defenses
in
the
courts
concerning
the
interpretation
of
the
act,
and
that
has
been
brought
up
in
cases
like
kaiser
steel.
but
the
courts
have...
this
court
has
recognized
a
distinction
between
bringing
something
as
an
affirmative
matter
and
bringing
it
as
a
defensive
matter.
for
example,
in
communications
workers
v.
beck,
which
was
not
a
case
exactly
like
this
but
it
involved
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
this
court
held
that
the
employer's
alleged
violation
of
8(a)(3)
of
the
act
could
be
raised
as
a
defense
to
the
claim,
but
that
an
8(a)(3)
claim
could
not
be
asserted
at
the
outset
in
federal
court,
and
there's
a
good
reason--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--justice
scalia,
i
think
it
is
not
a
classic
declaratory
judgment
action
in
the
sense
that
this
court
has
held
repeatedly
in
the
franchise
tax
board
case,
in
skelly
oil
and
a
number
of
others,
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
can't
expand
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
now,
if
the
court
had
jurisdiction
because
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
act
and
there
was
a
controversy
over
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
act,
of
course
there
would
be
jurisdiction
under
301(c).
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes,
a
violation
of
the
contract,
but
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
justice
scalia.
there
is
no
claim
here
that
anybody
has
violated
the
contract.
the
only
claim
is
that
the
court--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
they--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--if
they
said
we
are
about
to
strike
and
we'd
like
a
declaration,
that
would
not
be
this
case.
i
would
think
that
if
it
got
to
the
point
of
being
an
anticipatory
repudiation
similar
to
dowd
box--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes,
you
could.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
that's
not
this
case.
there
are--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--there
has
been
no
violation,
no
alleged
violation,
and
we
suggest
that
when
congress
said
suits
for
violation
it
was
very
clear
that
there
had
to
be
a
suit
over
a
violation
of
the
contract.
there
is
no
suit
over
a
violation
of
the
contract
here.
they
were
asking
the
district
court
to
declare
that
at
some
future
time
if
they
chose
to
do
it
they
could
engage
in
a
strike
which
otherwise
might
be
in
violation
of
the
contract,
so
there
was
no
present
controversy
about
a
violation
or
even
an
anticipated
violation
of
the
agreement.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
think
there
are
certainly
some
circumstances
where--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--if
the
dispute
is
over
a
violation
of
the
agreement,
yes--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
think
under
some
circumstances
that
could
be
brought.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
i'm
suggesting,
under
the
circumstances
you
just
mentioned,
you
could
imagine,
yes,
that
there
would
be
section
301
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
it
isn't
the
question
of
what
the
basis
for
the
claim
is.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
justice
breyer,
i
agree
that
there
may
be
circumstances
in
which
something
has
gotten
to
the
point
where
there
is
a
real
dispute
about
whether
there
would
be
a
violation
of
the
contract
which
possibly
could
be
brought
into
federal
court.
this
isn't
that
situation.
what
this
situation
is,
where
you
have
an
exactly
parallel
proceeding
in
district
court
and
what
you
have
is
an
effort
in
essence
to
bring
unfair
labor
practice
charges
into
court
rather
than
to
bring
them
before
the
board,
and
congress
when
it
enacted
section
301
could
not
have
possibly
contemplated
that.
indeed,
the
legislative
history
shows
quite
clearly
that
congress
was
very
concerned
about
overlapping
affirmative
jurisdiction
between
the
board
and
the
courts,
and
they
said
that
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
original
taft-hartley
act
would
have
given
the
board
jurisdiction
to
determine
compliance
with
contracts.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
the
offer
and
acceptance
dispute
could
have
been
remitted
to
the
board.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
in
some
circumstances
conflicting
jurisdiction
is
tolerated
and
will
exist.
the
problem
is
that
if
you
are
allowed
to
bring
this
kind
of
proceeding,
this
kind
of
abstract
proceeding
before
there
has
been
a
real
dispute
about
whether
the
contract
was
violated,
what
you
would
be
doing
is
to
in
essence
say,
virtually
any
unfair
labor
practice
charge
can
be
framed
as
a
declaratory
judgment
matter
to
be
brought
into
court.
anything
having
to
do
with
the
collective
bargaining,
the
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith
could
be
brought
into
court
on
the
theory
that
there
might
be
in
some
future
time
a
dispute
about
the
ability
to
strike
under
the
contract.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
i
think
that's
exactly
why
this
matter
belongs
before
the
board,
because
of
course
the
distinction
between
mandatory
and
permissive
subjects
of
bargaining
under
this
court's
decision
in
first
national
maintenance
is
a
very
difficult
line
to
draw,
one
that
the
board
has
struggled
with
again
and
again
over
the
years,
and
if
it's
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
there
is
the
obligation
to
supply
the
information
to
the
union,
but
if
it
is
a
permissive
subject
of
bargaining
the
obligation
does
not
exist
to
supply
the
information
to
the
union.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that's
exactly
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
we
suggest
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no,
no,
but
justice
stevens,
it's
exactly
because
of
the
difficult
distinctions
between
mandatory--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--and
permissive
subjects
of
bargaining
that
this
case
belongs
before
the
board.
the
board
ought
to
be
deciding
whether
there
was
an
obligation
to
supply
the
information
or
not
supply
the
information.
that
turns
on
whether
it
was
a
mandatory
or
permissive
subject
of
bargaining.
the
courts
are
ill-equipped
to
make
that
kind
of
determination.
that's
something
that--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--no,
absolutely
not.
i
think
there
are
two
separate
issues
here.
one
is
misrepresentation.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
which
under
truett--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--that
would
apply
to
mandatory
and
permissive
subjects
of
bargaining.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
the
main
part
of
the
charge
here
is
that
there
was
a
request
for
information,
that
we
didn't
supply
the
information.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
and
that
turns
on
the
distinction
between
mandatory
and
permissive
subjects
of
bargaining.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
absolutely.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
there's
no
license
to
lie,
whether
it's
a
mandatory
or
permissive
subject
of
bargaining.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes.
i
mean,
this
court's
decision
in
truett
manufacturing
discusses
the
obligation
to
engage
in
honest
bargaining,
and
the
board
has
implemented
that
in
a
large
number
of
cases.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
the
line,
justice
souter,
that
i'm
suggesting
that
you
draw
is
between
matters
that
are
asserted
as
defense,
either
contract
defenses
before
the
board
or
unfair
labor
practice
defenses
in
court,
as
opposed
to
allowing
affirmative
jurisdiction.
that
is,
to
bring
contract
issues
in
the
first
instance
before
the
board
or
bring
unfair
labor
practice
charges
before
the
courts.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
there
was,
if
my
recollection
is
correct,
a
dispute
about
a
violation
in
the
mack
case,
the
original...
the
third
circuit
case
that
preceded
this
one
and
yes,
that
probably
was
within...
that
was
probably
correctly
decided.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
there
can
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
under
those
circumstances.
refusal
to
execute
an
agreement,
justice
scalia,
that
the
parties
have
reached
can
be
a
violation
of
8(d)
of
the
act,
but
yes,
there--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--there
may
be,
justice
scalia,
some
small
number
of
cases
in
which
there
is
no
board
remedy
available
to
a
party
in
the
union's
situation.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
and
no
federal
court
remedy
as
an
anticipatory
matter
but,
of
course,
when
there
is
a
violation
that
can
be
asserted
as
a
defense,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
existence
of
that
small
number
of
cases
should
drive
the
decision
here.
i
mean,
in
the
vast
majority
of
situations
there
is
a
remedy
before
the
board,
and
the
board
is
the
place
to
go.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
think
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
anticipatory
situations
there
is
a
remedy
before
the
board.
if
you
allow
people
to
go
into
court...
i'll
give
another
example,
that
if
there
is
an
unfair
labor
practice
alleged
to
occur
during
the
performance
of
a
contract
the
union
can
claim
that
it
has
a
right
to
strike
in
violation
of
the
no-strike
clause...
that's
mastrow
plastics...
and
what
the
union
could
do
under
those
circumstances
is
go
into
court
and
say,
we'd
like
a
declaratory
judgment
that
we're
entitled
to
strike
because
the
employer
engaged
in
unfair
labor
practices.
if
you're
an
inventive
lawyer
either
on
the
union's
side
or
the
employer's
side
you
can
craft
a
declaratory
judgment
action
that
would
bring
a
whole
range
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
effectively
before
the
federal
courts--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--thereby
bypassing
the
board.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
that's
a
possibility,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
ninth
circuit
has
held
that
if
there's
no
unfair
labor
practice
potential
before
the
board
you
can
go
into
state
court
and
apply
state
law.
that
is
a
difficult
question
which--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--it's
not
difficult
as
to
whether
you
could
go
into
state
court
or
not.
i
think
the
difficult
issue
is
whether
you
would
apply
state
or
federal
law
when
you
went
into
state
court.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
our
argument,
mr.
chief
justice,
would
mean
that
you
could
not
go
into
state
court
under
section
301
either,
because
the
scope
of
federal
jurisdiction
and
the
scope
of
state
jurisdiction
are
the
same.
both
are
governed
by
section
301.
both
require
suits
for
violation,
so
you
could
not
go
into
state
court
and
seek
a
declaratory
judgment
under--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
believe
it
is,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
our
position,
justice
scalia,
is
that
there
isn't
any
room
for
state
law
here,
that
even
if
you
went
into
state
court,
that
you
would
have
to
apply
federal
law,
but
that
the
state
court
no
more
than
the
federal
court
can
give
declaratory
relief
under
these
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i
have
conceded
that
there
is
some
small
class
of
cases
in
which
there
would
be
no
anticipatory
remedy.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
you
could
always
assert
it
as
a
defense.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
yes.
we've
suggested
that
the
language
is
very
plain,
and
the
lower
court
in
the--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--our
section
301
argument--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--is
based
on
statutory
text--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--and
the
legislative
history,
but
we
have
also
argued
alternatively
that
there
is
garmon
preemption
here
even
if
you
could
somehow
shoe
this...
shoe-horn
this
in
within
section
301,
that
the
evening
news
exception
to
garmon
preemption
only
applies,
as
this
court
said
in
lockridge,
where
the
cause
of
action
requires
a
construction
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
here,
no
construction
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
remotely
involved
and
therefore
we
suggest
that
garmon
preemption,
that
is,
garmon
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
we're
suggesting
that
if
the
union
brought
an
action
for
violation
of
contract
which
did
not
depend
in
any
way
on
the
interpretation
of
the
contract,
which
is
the
scope
of
the
smith
v.
evening
news
exception,
there
might
not
be
jurisdiction
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
it's
not,
mr.
chief
justice,
so
much
a
question
of
"jurisdiction".
it's
more
a
question
of
301,
but
that
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
might
apply.
that's
what
garmon
is
when
you're
dealing
with
federal
law
issues.
but
the
primary
jurisdiction
doctrine
might
say
you
should
resort
to
the
board
even
though
the
district
court
has
technical
jurisdiction.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
that's
correct,
and
the
matter
is
still
pending
before
the
board.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
i
think
in
essence
we
are.
when
we
talk
about
a
garmon...
the
garmon
doctrine
applying
here,
even
if
there's
technical
jurisdiction
under
section
301,
what
we're
saying
is
the
court
should
leave
it
to
the
board
under
those
circumstances,
particularly
when
you
have
a
board
proceeding
pending
and,
most
particularly,
when
there's
no
construction
of
the
contract
that's
involved.
after
all,
that
was
the
task
assigned
by
congress
to
the
federal
courts,
was
to
construe
these
collective
bargaining
agreements.
there's
no
construction
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
involved
in
this
case.
the--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
agree
that
you
can
have
an
action
to
construe
the
contract
for
violation
of
the
contract
that
requires
a
construction
of
the
contract.
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
somehow,
if
this
court
went
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
violation
encompassed
anything
relating
to
the
contract,
a
position
which
you
seem
to
have
rejected
in
the
franchise
tax
board
case,
we're
suggesting
that
if
you
went
that
far
and
said,
oh,
yes,
this
fits
within
the
suits
for
violation
of
contract,
you
should
still
say
it's
within
the
primary
jurisdiction
of
the
board.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
there's
a
dispute
about
a
federal
law--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--yes.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
i--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--i
suppose,
justice
breyer,
that
such
a
suit
would
lie.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
but
it
depends
on
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts
over
the
coercive
suit
that
the
other
party
could
have
brought.
here,
there
is
no
coercive
suit
that
the
employer
could
have
brought.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--well,
i
think
ripeness
and
the
question
of
whether
there's
been
a
violation
or
imminently
threatened
violation
are
very
similar
questions,
and--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--but
that's
not...
that's
not
the
issue
here.
there
is
no--
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
--imminently
threatened
violation.
indeed,
the
union
did
not
say
that
if
it
got
this
declaration
that
it
would
strike.
it
said
it
wanted
to
use
this
declaration
with
respect
to
the
contract
being
invalid,
the
unfair
labor
practice
issue,
in
the
course
of
negotiations.
this
was
not
a
situation
in
which
the
union
came
in
and
threatened
to
strike.
there
could
have
been
no
coercive
action
here
by
the
employer,
and
we
simply
suggest
that
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act
there
simply
can't
be
a
declaratory
action,
either,
and
that
to
allow
this
would
be
to
allow
unions
and
employers
to
bring
all
sorts
of
unfair
labor
practice
charges
in
the
courts,
where
they
don't
belong,
instead
of
the
board,
where
congress
said
they
should
be.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
well,
under
some
circumstances
probably
a
declaratory
judgment
like
that
could
be
brought.
there
are
questions
about
an
employer's
ability
to
sue
to
enjoin
a
threatened
strike.
i
believe
the
lower
courts
are
divided
about
the
standards
there.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
no,
justice
kennedy.
we
agree
that
an
anticipatory
repudiation
of
the
contract
under
standard
contract
law
is
a
violation
of
the
contract,
that
if
there
weren't
anticipatory
repudiation,
that
you
could
bring
a
lawsuit
in
federal
court
under
section
301.
the
dowd
box
case,
the
facts
of
the
dowd
box
case
seem
to
be
similar
to
that.
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
thank
you.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
just
briefly,
mr.
chief
justice,
if
you
look
at
the
complaint
that
was
filed
in
this
case,
which
is
pages
16
to
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
particularly
to
paragraphs
5
through
10,
which
are
the
operative
paragraphs,
you
can
see
quite
clearly
that
the
theory
of
this
complaint
is
a
failure
to
supply
information
in
response
to
the
union's
request.
this
is
at
the
heart
of
the
board's
expertise
and
the
board's
jurisdiction,
determining
when
there
is
an
obligation
on
the
part
of
the
employer
to
supply
information
to
the
union.
the
union
has
admitted
in
its
brief
that
board
law
must
apply
to
this
proceeding,
so
we
suggest
that
in
terms
of
the
substantive
rules,
there's
an
exact
parallel
here
between
the
complaint
theory
and
the
board
theory,
and
justice
stevens,
i
don't
know
of
a
lot
of
cases
where
the
board
has
addressed
misrepresentations
in
the
context
of
permissive
bargaining,
but
there's
no
reason
as
a
matter
of
theory
that
that
shouldn't
be
the
case.
and
if
one
looks
at
the
brief
filed
by
the
united
states
here,
the
united
states
does
not
suggest
that
there's
any
gap
in
the
jurisdiction
of
the
board
with
respect
to
this
particular
case.
they
make
very
clear
that
the
board
can
invalidate
contracts,
make
employees
whole...
there's
an
absolute
identity
of
the
theories
that
can
be
brought
before
the
board
and
the
relief
that
can
be
gotten
from
the
board,
and
the
board
was
set
up
by
congress
to
determine
what
relief
should
be
granted
under
these
circumstances.
sometimes
it
will
be
invalidation
of
the
whole
contract
or,
as
here,
a
part
of
the
contract,
and
it's
that
kind
of
discretion,
that
kind
of
expertise
which
the
board
has
and
the
courts
don't
have
and
is
a
primary
reason
why
this
court
should
not
permit
the
federal
courts
to,
in
essence,
adjudicate
unfair
labor
practices
that
otherwise
would
come
before
the
board.
mr.
timothy
b.
dyk
oh,
yes.
in
fact,
the
board
settlement
awarded
back
pay
damages
and
the
united
states
in
its
brief
acknowledged
that
the
board
can
award
these
kinds
of
damages.
thank
you.
