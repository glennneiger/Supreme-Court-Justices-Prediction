unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question?
the
contract
has
expired?
unknown
speaker
and
there's
been
a
strike
in
the
interim
by
the
union?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
this
whole
thing
moot?
we
don't
have
a
contract
any
more.
there's
been
some
limited
relief
granted.
why
should...
why
is
there
anything
left
for
us?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
also
provide
for
the
payment
of
survivor's
benefits
for
a
certain
number
of
years
after
the
contract
expired?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
dyk,
you
concede
if
it
came
up
defensively
it
would
properly
be
a
matter
for
the
court.
say
the
union
violated
the
no-strike
clause
and
the
union's
answer
to
that
is,
this
whole
contract
is
no
good
because
it
was
induced
by
fraud.
unknown
speaker
but
nonetheless
there's
nothing
about
the
issue
that
identifies
it
as
an
issue
only
for
the
board
and
never
for
the
courts.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
dyk,
isn't
it
the
whole
purpose
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act
to
enable
you
to
anticipate
your
defenses
instead
of
having
to
wait
for
a
lawsuit
by
the
other
side?
isn't
the
whole
purpose
of
it
to
enable
the
union,
for
example,
in
this
case
to
come
into
court
and
say,
we
do
not
intend
to
live
up
to
this
agreement.
we're
going
to
strike,
and
we
think
we
have
a
right
to
strike
because
the
agreement
is
invalidated
by
the
fraud
at
the
beginning,
and
we
want
a
declaratory
judgment
to
that
effect.
it
seems
to
me
a
classical
declaratory
judgment
action.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
at
all,
is
it?
it's
just
a
procedural
device
where
a
court
has
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
that's
his
claim.
that's
what
the
declaratory
judgment
claims.
unknown
speaker
the
declaration
judgment
says
the
other
side
claims
that
i
am
in
violation
of
the
contract,
and
i
say
i
am
not.
unknown
speaker
there's
never
a
claim
that
has
violated
a
declaratory
judgment.
it's
always
anticipatory,
right?
are
you
saying
that
they
just
didn't
use
the
right
words,
that
the
union
should
have
come
in
and
said,
we
are
about
to
strike
and
we
want
a
declaratory
judgment
that
this
will
not
be
a
violation
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
would
that
have
been
okay?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
can
you...
can
the...
suppose
the
employer
says
to
the
union
representative,
if
you
go
out
on
strike,
i
will
sue
you
for
breaching
this
contract.
he
says
that.
so
the
union
representative
says,
i
would
like
a
declaration
that
you
have
no
lawsuit.
he
brings
the
suit.
can
he
do
that
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
say
the
circumstance
is
a)
my
basis
as
union
representative
is
i
think
you
have
to
have
an
offer
and
an
acceptance
to
have
a
contract
and
here
there
was
no
offer,
or
there
was
no
acceptance.
unknown
speaker
no.
the
dispute
is...
this
is
the
dispute.
the
employer
says,
if
you
go
out
on
strike,
i
will
sue
you.
the
union
says,
if
you
sue,
you
will
lose.
why?
because
there
is
no
contract.
there
was
no
offer,
or
alternatively
there
was
no
acceptance.
i
don't
agree,
says
the
employer.
fine,
says
the
union.
i'll
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action.
can
they
do
it?
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
circumstances
i
just
mentioned?
unknown
speaker
yes,
all
right.
if
the
answer
to
that
is
yes,
now
we
have
exactly
the
same
dialogue
but
substitute
for
the
words,
offer
and
acceptance,
the
reason
your
contract
is
not
valid
is
it
was
obtained
by
fraud.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
reason
that
you
cannot
sue
me
for
a
breach
of
contract
is
because
the
contract
doesn't
exist,
and
the
reason
it
doesn't
exist
is
because
it
was
obtained
by
fraud.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
justice
breyer's
first
hypothetical,
could
the
offer
and
acceptance
dispute
have
been
remitted
to
the
board?
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
there
be
concurrent
jurisdiction,
or
conflicting
jurisdiction
in
that
case
just
as
well
as
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
may
i
just
ask
this.
you
say
anything
covers...
is
it
not
correct,
at
least
the
union
says
in
their
brief
that
you
took
the
position
before
the
board
that
this
fraud
was
not
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining
and
therefore
was
not
subject
to
review
by
the
board.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
we
have
to
decide
that
it
belongs
somewhere
else?
all
we
have
to
decide
here
is
whether
or
not
it
fits
the
definition
of
whether
this
is
an
action
for
violation
of
a
contract
and
if
it
isn't
that,
it
doesn't
belong
in
court.
maybe
it
belongs
before
the
board,
maybe
it
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
have
argued
that
the
better
forum
is
the
board,
and
that
argument
kind
of
falls
apart
if
the
forum
isn't
there.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
that
even
if
it
was
not
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining,
that
the
company
could
commit
fraud
in
the
negotiation
and
there
would
be
no
remedy
for
the
fraud?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
which
they
alleged.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
insofar
as
they're
alleg...
their
claiming
there
was
an
active
misrepresentation
or
a
fraud,
you
would
agree
that
could
be
remedied
by
the
board.
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk--
--does
the
board
have
jurisprudence
cases
on
misrepresentation
and
fraud?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk,
you
may
have
answered
this.
i
may
have
missed
it.
but
you
said
there
is
some
subjects
in
which
jurisdiction
may
be
concurrent
and
some
not.
where
do
you
draw
the
line?
how
do
we
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
but
that
does--
--mr.
dyk,
what
about
the
mack
case?
do
you
agree
that
that
was
properly
a
case
for
the
court
under
301?
that
is,
an
employer
that
said,
the
union
says
we've
got
no
contract.
we
say
we
do
have
a
contract.
court,
tell
us
we
have
a
contract.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
classic
contract
dispute
as
to
whether
there
was
a
meeting
of
the
minds?
i
mean,
there's
no
violation
of
the
labor
relations
act.
there's
not
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
minds
have
not
met.
unknown
speaker
well,
there's
been
no
violation
so
far.
nobody
has...
nobody
claims
a
violation,
but
the
union
wants
to
have
it
clearly
established
that
there
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
unknown
speaker
and
no
federal
court
remedy.
unknown
speaker
not
in
the
vast
majority
of
anticipatory
situations,
surely.
unknown
speaker
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--an
aggrieved...
either
the
employer
or
the
union
can
go
into
state
court,
can
they
not,
under
the
dowd
case?
unknown
speaker
so
it
isn't
as
if
they
can't
get
into
federal
court
under
section
301
they
have
no
judicial
remedy.
they
can
go
to
state
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
is
it
difficult
after
the
dowd
box
case?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
something
that
isn't
involved
here,
certainly.
at
least
there
is
some
sort
of
judicial
forum
in
which
this
dispute
could
be
resolved,
even
though
you
can't
get
into
federal
court
under
301.
unknown
speaker
you
think
that's
a
result
of
the
dowd
box
case?
unknown
speaker
which
means
that
you'd
have
some
of
the
law
of
labor
contacts
made
by
state
law
rather
than
by
federal
law,
which
is
seemingly
what
the
act
envisions,
or
what
we've
said
the
act
envisions.
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
would
be
no
remedy,
to
answer
the
chief
justice's
first
question.
if
you
concede
that
the
state
courts
could
not
apply
state
law,
there
would
be
no
remedy.
unknown
speaker
anticipatory.
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
for
no
anticipatory
remedy
comes
down
simply
to
plain
language,
i
take
it.
in
other
words,
it's
not
necessary
to
preserve
board
jurisdiction
because
there
are
some
cases
in
which,
as
you
say,
there
would
be
no
conflict
with
board
jurisdiction,
so
it's
a
straight
plain
language
theory,
in
effect
that
the
language
of
301
trumps
the
normal
rule
which
would
allow
a
declaratory
judgment.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
all.
i
mean,
you
don't...
basically
your
argument
is
not
an
argument
based
upon
the
preservation
of
board
jurisdiction.
it's
an
argument
based
on
the
statutory
text,
period.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
if
the
union
brought
an
action
simply
for
a
violation
of
the
contract
and...
that
there
might
be
preemption
of
that
sort
of
a
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
statute
speaks
quite
plainly.
it
says
you
can
bring
an
action
for
violation
of
a
contract.
how
could
there
not
be
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
wouldn't
you
make
that
argument--
--well,
that's
a
strange
doctrine.
--here,
that
the
election...
if
it's
primary
jurisdiction,
they
went
to
the
board
first,
but
i
don't
think
you're
making
any
kind
of
election
of
remedies
argument
that...
this
union
did
go
to
the
nlrb
a
year
before
coming
to
court,
right,
so--
unknown
speaker
--so
why
aren't
you
making
any
kind
of
primary
jurisdiction
argument
with
respect
to
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
can't
have
an
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment,
which
you
certainly
are
maintaining
in
light
of
the
statute,
and
you
can't
have
an
action
for
construction
of
the
contract,
what
sort
of
action
for
violation
of
contract
can
you
have
under
section
301?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
do
you
know,
is
there
any
authority...
it
seemed
to
me
there
ought
to
be
fairly
clear
whether
you
could
or
couldn't
do
this,
but
in
suits
that
are,
let's
say,
arising
under
suits,
a
person
might
have
a
state
law
defense,
and
is
there
any
reason
that
the
person
with
a
state
law
defense
cannot
get
a
declaratory
judgment
action
on...
where
he's
claiming
that
i'm
being
threatened
by
a
federal
suit
and
if
the
person
brings
that
federal
suit
i
have
a
perfectly
good
defense
and
he
wants
it
litigated
in
a
declaratory
judgment
action?
unknown
speaker
oh,
an
antitrust
case.
unknown
speaker
some
private
person
says,
i'm
going
to
bring
an
antitrust
case
against
you,
and
the
defendant
says,
look,
i
have
a
piece
of
paper
here.
you
promised
not
to.
it's
a
state
law
contract
between
us.
i
would
have
thought
it
would
be
settled.
i
would
have
thought
you
could
have
done
it.
you
could
go
into
a
declaratory...
in
court
and
say
i
want
a
declaratory
action.
a
person's
threatening
me,
but
he
hasn't
brought
it
yet,
a
federal
suit.
i
want
a
declaration
that
he
has
no
federal
suit--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
reason
that
i
have
this
state
law
defense.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
he
could
have
brought
a
suit
claiming
that
the
contract
was
being
violated
and
if
you
say,
well,
he
wouldn't
have,
that
would
seem
to
be
a
question
of
whether
the
declaratory
judgment
action
is
ripe
or
not.
unknown
speaker
that
would
seem
a
question
of
whether...
i
mean,
yes,
of
course
you're
right,
if
there's
no
threat
he
can't
bring
the
declaratory
judgment
action.
unknown
speaker
yes,
exactly,
so
if
there's
no
imminently
threatened
violation,
you
can't
be
ripe.
that
isn't
the
question
before
us.
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
the
union
said,
we
are
in
imminent
danger
of
the
employer
enforcing
this
contract
against
us
because
we're
going
to
take
a
specific
action.
we're
going
to
strike.
and
we
want
this
contract
declared
void
because
it
was
procured
by
fraud.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
just
want
a
declaration
of
contract
invalidity.
would
that
be
violation
of
the
contract?
i
thought
it
was
your
position
that
that's
not
a
violation
of
the
contract,
that's
renouncing
the
contract,
and
that's
different
than
a
violation
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
dyk.
unknown
speaker
mr.
yokich,
we'll
hear
from
you.
perhaps,
mr.
yokich,
you
could
tell
us
what
your
view
is
of
possible
mootness
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
wouldn't
anticipate
fraud
in
the
future.
i
mean,
it
just
doesn't
lend
itself
to
that
analysis,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
what
you
say
is
capable
of
repetition
is
a
claim
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
a
contract,
whether
that
qualifies.
it
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
be
the
same
fraud
situation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
yokich,
do
i
have
to
struggle
with
that?
why
isn't
the
fact
that
there
are
benefits
under
this
contract
that
must
continue
to
be
provided
after
the
term
of
the
contract
has
ended,
why--
unknown
speaker
--i
know
it's
an
argument.
why
isn't
it
right?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what's
the
argument
on
the
other
side?
let's
put
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
somebody
ought
to
give
us
the
argument
on
the
other
side,
if
there
is
any.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
it's
a
good
argument.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dyk--
--is
it
a
correct
argument?
i
don't
care
whether
it's
obscene
or
not.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
dyk's
point
was
that
you
got
a
damage
action
going
down
below
anyway,
and
it's
the
damage
action
which
would
be
affected
by
this
and
therefore
that's
why
there's
no
mootness
here.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
you
agree.
unknown
speaker
you
agree.
unknown
speaker
so
why
do
you
bother
with
the
capable
of
repetition
yet
evasive
of
review
if
you've
got
a
concrete
thing
like
damages
that
you
say
survive?
unknown
speaker
so
you
wouldn't
put
that
as
the
number
1
reason
that
it
isn't
moot.
unknown
speaker
what
about
something...
you
said
that
the
determination
here
will
inevitably
impact
on
the
bargaining
that's
currently
going
on,
that
you
need
to
know
whether
the
old
contract
was
no
good,
and
you
said
that
will
surely
affect
how
it's
bargaining
now,
and
i
thought,
well,
how?
how
will
this
information
about
the
old
contract
have
an
impact
on
the
bargaining
for
the
new
contract?
unknown
speaker
but
here
you're
saying
the
whole
contract
is
no
good,
so
i
just
don't
understand
how
that
declaration
would
affect
bargaining
of
a
new
contract.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
lincoln
mills
broadened
the
jurisdictional
grant
beyond
the
language
that
congress
had
chosen?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
we're
talking
about
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you...
what...
beyond
suits
for
violation
of
contracts,
which
is
the
statutory
language,
do
you
think
lincoln
mills
said
other
things
are
included
in
that
jurisdictional
grant,
too?
i
wouldn't
have
read
it
that
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
with
respect
to
the
provision
of
remedies
for
a
violation.
yes.
that's
what
was
involved
in
lincoln
mills.
the
question
was,
are
you
going
to
provide
this
equitable
remedy
for
a
violation?
how
does
lincoln
mills
take
you
beyond
the
for
violation
language?
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
rate
that,
as
a
decent
argument,
or--
[laughter]
--a
good
argument?
unknown
speaker
pg?
pg,
general,
or--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
considering
the
court's
latitude,
suppose
you're
right
that
theoretically
there
is
a
301
suit
here.
suppose
a
district
judge
then
said,
well,
this
union
went
to
the
board
first,
and
i
have
to
apply
board
law,
so
i'm
going
to
say,
prior
proceeding
pending,
and
wait
until
the
board
acts.
would
that
be
a
proper
response
to
your
claim?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
you
with
a
question
there?
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent
that,
if
it
is
not
a
mandatory
subject
of
bargaining,
but
there
was
nevertheless
active
fraud
in
the
negotiation
on
the
nonmandatory
issue,
that
the
board
could
remedy
that
as
a
failure
to
bargain
in
good
faith?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
it's
permissive,
and
that
there's
active
fraud
in
misleading
the
union
and
the
board
would
be
powerless
to
remedy
that.
that's
your
view.
unknown
speaker
i
know
there's
no
duty
to
disclose.
i'm
assuming
there's
no
duty
to
disclose,
but
there
nevertheless
is
an
active
misrepresentation.
unknown
speaker
he
said
there
were
a
lot
of
them.
that's
what
puzzles
me.
unknown
speaker
are
there
any
board
cases
saying
they
have
no
power
to
give
relief
in
such
situation?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
and
you
think,
in
representing
the
union,
the
board
would
not
have
the
power
to
declare
a
contract
void
on
the
theory
that
the...
there
was
no
bargaining
in
good
faith
because
of
fraud
such
as
i've
described?
unknown
speaker
the
petitioner's
brief
makes
that
statement
that
the
nlrb
could,
as
a
remedy
for
an
unfair
labor
practice,
invalidate
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
you
read
the
statute
as
if
it
were
to
say,
suits
respecting
contracts.
unknown
speaker
what
authority
does
the
board
have
to
construe
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so,
then,
why
is
it
important
that
the
board
may
have
construed
it
that
way?
unknown
speaker
you
misspoke.
i
think
you
meant
the
courts--
--oh.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
this
court,
when
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i've
just
been
rereading
textile
workers
and
i
must
say
i
don't
agree
with
your
characterization
of
that.
it
seems
to
me
the
court
said,
jurisdiction
is
jurisdiction,
and
they
went
on
to
say
that
with
section
(b)
there
was
a
grant
of
federal...
an
additional
grant
to
federal
courts
to
develop
a
case
law,
just
as
you
say.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
see
anything
expansive
in
there
about
the
jurisdictional
ground.
unknown
speaker
maybe
you
could
refer
me
to
specific
language.
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
strange,
really,
if
you
have
a
limited
jurisdictional
grant
and
then
construed
to
authorize
development
of
substantive
law
in
cases
within
that
jurisdictional
grant,
and
then
the
substantive
law
doctrines
enlarged
the
jurisdictional
grant.
unknown
speaker
are
there
cases
in
the
arbitration
area
where
the
contract
says
suits
for
violation
of
this
agreement
shall
be
arbitrated,
and
then
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
agreement
is
void?
unknown
speaker
well,
my
question
was
whether
or
not
there
are
cases
going
to
the
scope
of
the
arbitrator's
authority.
one
party
says
the
contract
says
suits
for
violation
of
this
agreement
are
arbitrated,
and
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
there's
fraud,
and
the
party
who's
trying
to
defend
says,
oh,
well,
the
arbitrator
can't
consider
this
because
this
goes
to
the
whole
contract
and
this
is
not
a
violation
of
the
contract.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
say
about
what
i
take
it
is
the
declaratory
judgment
theory?
suppose
mr.
dyk
were
to
say,
yes,
of
course,
you
can
bring
that
kind
of
claim
as
a
declaratory
judgment
to
get
the
contract
declared
void
because
that's
a
possible
defense
that
you'd
have
if
the
employer
were
to
sue
you,
but
that
isn't
the
theory
that
was
argued
below
and
anyway,
if
it
were,
you'd
lose
because
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
threat
that
the
employer
really
would
sue
you,
and
here
there
was
none.
unknown
speaker
and
then
he
said
you'd
lose,
though,
on
that.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
not
how
it
goes
with
declaratory
judgments.
the
question
is,
how
imminent
is
it
that
you
are
going
to
be
hurt
by
what
happened?
it's
not,
does
anything
more
have
to
happen.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
sound...
i
mean,
you
can
think
of
any
kind
of
contract.
think
of
a
landlord
and
tenant.
they
want
to
settle
what
the
contract
means,
and
so
they
bring
this
suit
and
the
court
will
tell
them
and
they
can
go
on.
declaratory...
there
has
to
be,
especially
in
the
federal
courts,
a
case
or
controversy,
so
you
can't
just
have
this
iffy,
something
happened
then,
and
it
may
ripen
into
an
adversary
concept
later.
unknown
speaker
you
don't...
you're
not
going
so
far
as
to
contradict,
however,
the
assertion
that
you
have
not
threatened
to
violate
the
contract?
have
you
positively
threatened
to
violate
the
contract?
unknown
speaker
the
alleged
contract,
i
suppose
i
should
say.
unknown
speaker
i
have
understood
your
position
to
be
that
you
do
not
need
to
allege
a
threatened
violation
of
the
contract
in
order
to
establish
the
jurisdiction
you
seek
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
really
think
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
this
case
doesn't
turn
on
an
estimate
of
probabilities
of
how
much
likelihood
there
was
of
a
strike.
you
think
basically
you
should
just
go
in
cold
and
say,
we
want
to
know
whether
we're
bound
by
the
contract
or
not.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
set
aside
the
entire
contract.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
you
have
a
landlordtenant
dispute,
and
say
a
maryland
lawyer
is
renting
an
apartment
from
a
virginia
lawyer,
and
they've
signed
a
lease,
and
right
after
they
sign
the
lease
the
virginia
lawyer
sues
the
maryland
lawyer
in
federal
district
court
and
says,
we
just
want
to...
i
want
to
know
whether
this
is
a
binding
contract
or
not,
and
the
maryland
lawyer
says,
i
do,
too,
and
we'll
just
avoid
future
disputes.
is
that
justiciable?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
distinction
here
is,
i
don't
think
there's
any
doubt
that
if
the
statute
clearly
covered
your
case
there
would
be
article
iii
jurisdiction.
having
an
interest
in
knowing
whether
there's
a
good
contract
is
sufficient
to
give
you
standing.
the
question
is
whether
it
comes
within
the
scope
of
this
particular
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
if
you
construe
the
word
for
as
meaning
concerning
that
doesn't
get
over
the
principal
hurdle
as
to
whether
there's
a
violation.
unknown
speaker
you
agree,
don't
you,
mr.
yokich,
that
the
declaratory
judgment
act
doesn't
expand
any
jurisdiction.
it
just
applies
where
there
is
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
you
could
have
gone
into
state
court?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
do
with
the
dowd
box
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
it
have
been
under
section
301?
unknown
speaker
i
say,
why
would
it
have
been
301>
["]
when
section
301
is
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
for
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
it
isn't
covered
by
section
301,
it's
not
removable,
i
would
suppose.
unknown
speaker
even
though
there's
no
301
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
that
would
have
to
rank
as
one
of--
unknown
speaker
--one
of
the
less
plausible
arguments,
it
seems
to
me.
of
course,
you're
going
to
have
to
discuss
sooner
or
later
whether
one
reason
you
couldn't
go
into
state
court
would
be
because
of
garmon
preemption,
which
at
least
they
say
applies
here,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
congress
wasn't
perfect.
garmon
talks
about
arguably,
you
know,
and
from
what
you
both
said
to
me,
i
think
it's
at
least
arguable
the
board
could
fashion
a
remedy
for
fraud
in
the
inducement
of
a
contract
on
a
permissive
subject
of
bargaining.
unknown
speaker
so
your
argument
does
lead
to
the
end
result
that
there
would
be
many,
many
more
cases
of
overlap
of
board
jurisdiction
and
court
jurisdiction
than
has
been
thought
up
to
now.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
declaratory
judgment
cases.
i'm
talking
about
parallel
proceedings.
i
mean,
you
made
a
complaint
to
the
regional
council
first,
right?
unknown
speaker
one
whole
year,
so
couldn't
what
you
have
done
be
replicated
by
many
other
unions
in
this
situation,
that
is,
go
to
the
board,
they're
moving
too
slowly,
come
to
court?
unknown
speaker
how
many
cases
are
there
like
this
one
that
said
the
union,
on
what
would
be
a
defense,
can
come
in
and
get
a
301--
unknown
speaker
--why
wouldn't
the
employers
do
the
same,
though?
if...
why
hasn't
it
happened
whenever
an
employer
faces
a
weak
union
that
isn't
going
to
strike,
it
sues
to
have
the
whole
collective
bargaining
contract
set
aside
as
invalid?
unknown
speaker
and
they
had
all
these
things
run
right
into
federal
court,
and
they're
deciding
the
validity
of
all
the
collective
bargaining
agreements?
unknown
speaker
that
isn't
something
that
bothers
you,
or
the
board--
unknown
speaker
--no...
well...
what...
as
a
labor
lawyer--
unknown
speaker
--does
it
bother
you
that
if
you
win
in
this
case
i
guess
the
employers
would
have
a
perfectly
valid
legal
right
to
challenge
whatever
collective
bargaining
agreement
they
felt
was
invalid
as
a
matter
of
contract
law?
unknown
speaker
then
you
go
into
the
court,
not
the
board.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
yokich.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
dyk,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
can
the
board
award
damages,
which
is
one
of
the
things
they
sought
here?
