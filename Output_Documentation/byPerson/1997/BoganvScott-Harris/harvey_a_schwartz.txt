mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
jury
found
in
this
case
that
the
mayor
of
the
city
of
fall
river
and
the
city
council
vice
president
came
up
with
a
scheme
to
punish
janet
scott-harris
because
she
exercised
her
constitutionally
protected
right
to
complain
that
she
and
other
minority
employees
of
the
city
were
being
called
names
such
as
the
black
nigger
bitch,
and
that...
because
she
attempted
to
bring
disciplinary
charges
against
the
well-connected
long-time
city
employee
who
made
these
statements.
the
mayor
conceded
at
trial,
he
agreed
with
the
trial
judge
that
ms.
scott-harris'
speech
was
constitutionally
protected.
significantly,
the
mayor
also
conceded
at
trial
that
he
had
authority
under
massachusetts
law...
in
fact,
the
massachusetts
statute
was
marked
as
exhibit
85...
that
he
had
authority
on
his
own,
without
any
action
by
the
city
council,
to
fire,
to
lay
off,
to
remove
ms.
scott-harris
from
city
government.
he
had
authority
to
put
somebody
else
into
her
office.
he
had
authority
to
have
other
people,
the
people
who
had
reported
to
her
report
to
the
city
manager.
everything
that
was
done
by
this
ordinance
the
mayor
could
have
done
administratively,
on
his
own.
now,
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--that
addresses
two
points.
one
point
is
whether
this
was
a
legislative
act
at
all
if
it
was
an
action
that
could
have
been
done
administratively.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
i'm
not
saying
that
they're
necessarily
mutually
exclusive,
but
if
you
apply
the
court's
functionality
test,
if
you
say,
is
the
firing
of
one
employee
an
administrative
function
or
is
that
a
legislative
function--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--for
example,
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
case,
virginia
supreme
court
v.
consumers
union.
what
the
court
did
in
that
case
was
say,
we
have
different
forms
of
immunity
for
different
functions.
we
have
absolute
legislative
immunity
when
state
actors
function
in
a
legislative
capacity.
we
have
absolute
judicial
immunity
when
state
actors
function
in
a
judicial
capacity.
we
have
qualified
immunity
when
state
actors
function
in
an
administrative
or
executive
capacity.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
i...
under
tenney
v.
brandhove,
certainly
they
were.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
if
it's
viewed
in
that
light,
your
honor--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--i
suggest
that
if
the
mayor
had
eliminated
the
position
it
would
have
been
legislative
conduct.
if
the
act...
if
the
act
of
eliminating--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
in
actuality,
your
honor,
the
act
that
we're
looking
at
here
is
not
the
act
of
the
city
council.
it's
the
act
of
the
mayor,
who's
the
defendant
who
is
before
this
court,
in
submitting
an
ordinance
to
the
city
council,
so--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--no,
he
was
not,
so
the
question
would
be
whether...
what
the
jury
found,
the
action
of
submitting
an
ordinance
that
would--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
oh,
yes.
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
oh,
no.
no.
i
agree
that
he
was
acting
in
a
legislative
capacity,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
on
what
the
conduct
was.
his
conduct
was,
rather
than
acting
on
his
own,
on
his
own
authority,
an
action
that
he
admitted
he
would
not
have
even
had
qualified
immunity
for,
he
never
filed
a
qualified
immunity...
asserted
a
qualified
immunity
defense,
because
the
right
not
to
be
fired
because
of
your
speech
was
clearly
established.
so
this
was
an
action
that
he
could
have
taken
on
his
own.
he
would
have
had
no
immunity
of
any
kind.
instead,
he
chose
to
submit
this
to
the
city
council.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
no,
we
don't.
we
don't.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
and
for
all
we
know
the
mayor
was
successful
in
hoodwinking
the
other
members
of
the
city
council.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
and
i
suggest
that
the
appendix...
the
appendices
list
150
cases
in
which
local
governments
have
come
up
with
very
creative
ways
of
doing
just
that,
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
that
these
150
cases
show
example
after
example
of
excessive
creativity
at
the
local
level.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
the
creativity
is
used
to
evade
liability.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
and
the
result
of
allowing
conduct
that
a
state
official
is
empowered
to
do
on
his
own,
the
result
of
allowing
him
to
obtain
immunity
by
running
that
exact
same
conduct
through
the
city
council
is
in
effect
to
create
a
manual
for
violating
constitutional
rights.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
i'm
familiar
with
the
massachusetts
legislature--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--and
i
certainly
would
not
urge
their
pristine
character
upon
this
court.
but
on
the
other
hand,
when
it
comes
to
constitutional
violations,
i
don't
think
this
court
should
make
it
any
easier
to
evade
the
constitution,
or
to
make
it
any
easier
to
launder
intentional,
knowing
violations
of
clearly
established
constitutional
rights.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
breyer,
that
there
certainly
is
a
distinction
between
the
two
defendants,
and
if
one
looks
at
the
form
of
the
legislation,
of
the
ordinance
that
was
submitted
as
found
by
the
jury,
the
form
of
that
is,
in
other
words,
i
propose
the
city
council
pass
an
ordinance
that
will
remove
janet
scott-harris
from
city
government
because
of
her
constitutionally
protected
speech,
i
suggest
that
fits
all
of
the
elements
of
a
bill
of
attainder.
it's
contended--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--okay.
i
apologize
if
i
haven't
been
clear.
i
certainly
agree
that
step
1
of
the
legislative
process
is
the
submission
of
a
proposed
ordinance.
on
the
other
hand,
when
it
comes
to
matters
of
proof,
matters
of
motivation,
it's
certainly
much
easier
to
prove
the
motivation
of
the
one
individual
who
submits
the
ordinance
than
it
is
to
prove
the
collective
motivation
of
the
entire
body,
and
i
suggest
that
that's
just
what--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
the
difficulty
found
by
the
court
of
appeals,
however,
was,
although
it
was
easy
to
prove
the
motivation
of
the
mayor
and
roderick,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
we
weren't
able
to
prove
the
collective
motivation
of
the
board,
or
of
a
sufficient
number
of
members
of
the
board.
i
would
like
to
address
the
more
underlying
question
of
the
common
law
basis
for
this
absolute
legislative
immunity
at
the
local
level,
because
i
suggest
that
the
common
law,
as
it
was
established
in
1871,
is
nowhere
near
as
clearly
established
as
petitioner
suggests.
every
single
case
cited
by
petitioners,
every
single
authority
cited
by
petitioners
relies
on
the
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine,
and
petitioners
say
that
the
conduct
at
issue
in
this
case
was
discretionary,
therefore
there's
no
liability.
petitioners
also
agree...
and
they
cite
an
1877
case,
jones
v.
loving,
at
page
24
of
their
brief.
they
also
agree
that
this
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine
applied
equally
to
the
municipality
itself
as
it
did
to
the
municipal
decisionmakers,
and
they're
correct
in
that,
that
jones
v.
loving
says
that
members
of
the
legislative
body
are
clothed
with
the
immunity
of
the
municipality.
that
immunity
came
from
the
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine.
the
immunity
was
the
same
for
the
municipality
as
it
was
for
the
municipality's
decisionmakers.
now,
in
owens
v.
city
of
independence
this
court
relied
quite
heavily
on
the
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine
to
find
that
there
was
no
immunity
of
any
kind
for
municipalities
under
section
1983.
the
court
said
that
there's
no
discretion
to
violate
the
constitution,
that
the
constitution
is
mandatory,
and
that
it
is
not
a
discretionary
act
to
violate
the
constitution.
the
question
in
this
case
was,
as
found
by
the
jury,
did
the
mayor
have
the
discretion
to
submit
an
ordinance
to
remove
janet
scott-harris
from
city
government
to
punish
her
for
her
constitutionally
protected
speech?
i
suggest
that
that
was
not
a
discretionary
act.
now,
what's
significant
about
owen
is
that--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--in
the
common
law
it
was
called
ministerial.
the
term
ministerial
as
we
hear
it
implies
a
pretty
menial
task.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes,
and
ministerial
as
applied
by
the
common
law,
ministerial
as
applied
by
this
court
in
the
amy
and
farr
cases,
in...
just
a
month
before
section
1983
was
enacted,
ministerial
meant
that
there
was
no
legal
discretion
to
the
decisionmakers.
in
amy
and
farr,
the--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--they
had
to
act
that
way,
or,
conversely,
that
they
were
forbidden
to
act
in
a
certain
manner.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
it
was
the
way
that
the
ministerial
doctrine
was
applied
by
this
court
in
owen
v.
city
of
independence.
this
court
said
that
since
there
is
no
discretion
to
violate
the
constitution,
the
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine
would
not
provide
immunity
for
an
intentional
violation
of
the
constitution.
now,
what's
significant
about
owen
is
that,
while
the
court
said
that
the
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine
was
the
equivalent
of
no
immunity
under
section
1983,
the
dissenting
justices
said
that
the
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine
parallels
quite
closely
the
qualified
immunity
standard
of
this
court
under
harlow
v.
fitzgerald,
and
i
suggest
that
that
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine
does
parallel
this
court's
present
qualified
immunity
doctrine.
under
that
doctrine,
state
officials
have
discretion...
have
immunity
for
their
discretionary
acts
unless
their
discretionary
act
violates
a
clearly
established
legal
duty.
under
the
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine
as
applied
under
common
law,
a
local
official
had
immunity
for
his
discretionary
acts
unless
his
discretionary
act
violated
a
clearly
established
legal
duty.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
the
libel
cases
are
a
separate
line
of
cases,
and--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
the
common...
the
common
law
of
libel
at
present
in
the
majority
of
states
is
that
for
local
legislators,
it's
a
different
form
of
immunity
at
the
local
level
now
and
in
the
19th
century.
for
local
legislators,
a
local
legislator
was
liable
for
libel
if
he
acted
maliciously.
a
member
of
the
state
legislature
was
not
liable,
had
immunity
in
libel
cases,
whether
or
not
he
acted
maliciously.
i
suggest
the
massachusetts
cases
on
this
are
pretty
striking.
coffin
v.
coffin
was
the
one
common
law
case
relied
upon
by
this
court
in
tenney
v.
brandhove,
a
libel
action
for
statements
made
on
the
floor
of
the
massachusetts
legislature.
this
court
relied
upon
coffin
for
the
position
that
the
common
law
provided
absolute
immunity
to
members
of
the
state
legislature
in
a
libel
action
regardless
of
whether
they
acted
maliciously
or
not.
well,
20
years
after
coffin
v.
coffin,
the
same
massachusetts
court,
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court,
in
the
same
form
of
action,
a
slander
action
brought
against
a
member
of
a
town
governing
board,
the
brookline
board
of
selectmen,
did
not
apply
that
same
absolute
legislative
immunity
at
the
local
level,
but
instead
the
massachusetts
supreme
judicial
court
said
that
at
the
local
level,
in
a
slander
action,
if
the
person,
state
local
official
acted
maliciously
or
abused
his
office,
he
had
no
immunity.
so
under
the
libel
cases
the
immunity
rules
under
the
tort
law
were
different
for
members
of
the
state
legislature
than
they
were
for
members
of
local
legislative
bodies.
prosser,
keeton,
harper,
the
restatement
of
torts
all
say
that
that
is
still
the
rule.
they
all
state
unequivocally
that
the
absolute
immunity
in
libel
cases
for
members
of
state
legislative
bodies
does
not
apply
to
municipal
governing
bodies.
that's
a
clear
distinction
in
the
common
law,
and
i
suggest
that
that
distinction
in
the
common
law
imposing
liability
at
the
local
level
to
local
legislators
that
was
not
imposed
at
the
state
level,
and
also
the
discretional
ministerial
doctrine
that
imposed
liability
in
some
circumstances
at
the
local
level,
where
there
would
not
be
liability
at
the
state
level,
shows
that
the
common
law
distinguished
between
state
legislators
and
local
legislators,
and
because
the
common
law
distinguished
between
the
immunity
of
local
legislators
and
state
legislators,
petitioners
haven't
met
their
very
heavy
burden
of
proving--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
a
decision
whether
or
not
to
levy
a
general
tax
by
a
legislative
body
would
clearly
today
be
considered
a
legislative
act.
only
legislatures
can
levy
taxes.
this
court
in
the
amy
and
farr
cases
found
members
of
local
governing
boards
personally
liable
out
of
their
own
pockets
for
their
decisions
not
to
levy
a
general
tax.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
oh,
i...
but
i
do...
i
do
contend
that
exists
here.
what
i
contend
is
that
that
mandatory
nondiscretionary
act
doctrine
is
awfully
similar
to
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine,
that
where
a
law
is
clearly
established,
a
legal
right
or
a
legal
duty
is
clearly
established,
thou
shalt
not
fire
an
employee
because
of
her
constitutionally
protected
speech,
that
any...
when
the
mayor
does
that,
he's
going
beyond
his
discretion.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
what
i--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--i'm
not
crafting
this
doctrine
myself.
i'm
quoting
from
this
court's
decision
in
owen.
i'm
also
quoting
from
the
dissenting--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--no.
it
was
a
case
about
the
municipality,
obviously,
about
the
municipality's
liability.
however,
petitioners
agree
that
under
the
common
law
the
municipality
and
the
legislators
had
exactly
the
same
liability
and
exactly
the
same
immunities.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
the
first
authority
would
be
that
the
discretionary
ministerial
doctrine
did
not
apply
at
the
state
level.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
yes.
the
amy
and
farr
cases.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
okay,
that's--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
my
clue
would
be
note
23--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--at
page
17.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
as
to
whether
or
not
the
conduct
at
issue
was
legislative,
or
was
not
legislative,
i
would
refer
this
court
to
the
virginia
supreme
court
case.
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
case,
this
court
set
a
standard
for
what
action
of
a
legislative
nature
is.
the
standard
that
this
court
set
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
case
was
that
legislation
is
a
rule
of
general
application,
statutory
in
character,
that
acted
not
on
particular
parties,
that
did
not
arise
out
of
a
controversy,
but
instead
out
of
a
need
to
regulate
conduct
for
the
protection
of
all
citizens.
now,
if
that
is
what
a
legislative
act
is,
if
that
is
what
is
protected
in
the
virginia
supreme
court
case
by
absolute
legislative
immunity,
what
the
jury
found
the
mayor
and
the
city
council
vice
president
did
in
this
case
does
not
come
anywhere
near
those
definitions.
it
was
certainly
not
a
rule
of
general
application.
what
the
jury
found
the
mayor
and
the
city
council
vice
president
did
was
a
rule
aimed
at
one
particular
individual.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
the
evidence
at
trial
was
that
there
was
only
one
employee
of
that
department.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
what
the
jury
found--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
no.
no,
but
the
limitation
on
private
bills
that
affect
only
one
person
is
the
rule
against
bills
of
attainder,
and
a
piece
of
private
legislation
that
benefits
one
individual
is
certainly
not
a
bill
of
attainder.
a
private
legislation
that
says,
these
three
people
may
not
be
employed
by
the
federal
government,
or
no
federal
funds
may
be
used
to
pay
the
salaries
of
these
three
people,
legislation
that
says
no
member
of
the
communist
party
may
serve
as
an
official
of
a
labor
union--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--yes,
and
there
was
one
specific
person
who
held
that
position,
and--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--i'm
saying
it's
legislation,
but
i'm
saying
that
in
united
states
v.
brown
this
court
said
that
that
was...
constituted
a
bill
of
attainder,
and
it
was
not
legitimate
legislation.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
no,
i
wouldn't
say
that,
your
honor.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
no.
[laughter]
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
your
honor,
the
speech
or
debate
clause
has
been
interpreted
to
be
absolute
and
all-inclusive.
basically,
if
it's
done
in
congress
by
congress
there's
immunity.
applying
that
sort
of
broad
immunity
at
the
local
level,
where
the
executive
and
the
legislative
functions
are
merged,
sometimes
in
many
cases
merged
into
one
individual,
if
one
were
to
say
that
everything
done
by
the
town
governing
board
is
legislative,
to
which
there
is
immunity,
there
are
going
to
be
tens
of
thousands
of
municipalities
in
this
country
where
everything
done
will
be
immune,
but
everything
that's
done
by
these
governing
boards,
boards
of
selectmen
in
my
home
town,
hiring
of
individual
employees,
firing
of
individual
employees--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--it
depends
on
what
the
ordinance
is.
if
the
ordinance
is,
we
will
hire
john
brown
to
be
an
elementary
school
teacher,
it
might
say
ordinance
at
the
top
of
the
piece
of
paper,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
makes
it
an
ordinance.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
i'm--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--oh,
absolutely.
we
had
a
resounding
debate
at
my
local
town
meeting
about
whether
we
should
spend
25
dollars
to
repair
the
radar
gun
because--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
not
in
that
case.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
well,
not
in
that
case.
the
money
had
already
been
appropriated.
it
was
whether
the
police
chief
should
be
forbidden
from
spending
it
for
that
purpose,
which--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
that
would
be
legislative,
but
if
that
were
done...
if
that
were
done
by
the
board
of
selectmen,
if
the
board
of
selectmen
on
their
own
said,
let's
not
spend
that
25
dollars
to
repair
the
radar
gun,
that
would
not
be--
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
--well,
if
one
were
to
say
that
anything
done
by
a
legislative
body
is
legislation,
but
anything
done
by
an
executive
body
is
executive,
that
would
certainly
be
a
simple
solution,
but
i
don't
know
that
that
would
address
the
realities
of
local
government.
mr.
harvey
a.
schwartz
thank
you.
