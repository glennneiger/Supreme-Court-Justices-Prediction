what
you're
saying,
i
take
it,
or
tell
me
if
i'm
correct,
is
that
there
may
well
be
a
constitutional
wrong
here.
legislators
may
well
have
violated
their
constitutional
oath,
but
there's
simply
no
remedy
as
against
them.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
other
point
is,
the
department
is
permanently
abolished.
if
this...
if
you're
going
to
reinstate
it,
there
has
to
be
a
new
law
enacted
by
the
council.
