--no,
but
the
reason
you
were
debating
it
was
that
the
town
had
to
appropriate
money,
which
was
a
legislative
act,
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
person
who
spent
the
money,
i
presume,
was
the
board
of
selectmen,
and
i
assume
they
weren't
acting
as
legislators
when
they
spent
the
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
which
is
an
amendment,
i
suppose,
to
the
appropriation.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
legislative.
isn't
that
easy?
justice
david
h.
souter
like
any...
like
any
executive
official,
the
board
of
selectmen
might
decide
not
to
use
the
authority
that
was
given
them,
and
when
they
make
that
decision
i
suppose
that's
an
administrative
or
an
executive
decision,
not
a
legislative
one.
but
i
mean,
aren't
those
pretty
garden
variety
examples
of
classifications
that
are
fairly
easy
to
make?
