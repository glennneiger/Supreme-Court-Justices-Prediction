well,
i
think
we've
read
the
facts.
can
we
get
on
to
the
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
city
itself
being
liable?
i
know
that's
dropped
out
of
the
case
here
as
it
comes
to
us,
but
can
the
city
itself
be
liable
for
a...
an
ordinance
that
is
racially
motivated,
for
example?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
legislators
enacting
it
are
not
personally
liable,
is
your
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whether
it's
at
the
city
level
or
the
state
level.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
at
the
city
level
they
can
sue
the
city.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
you
told
me
it
isn't
home
free.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
city
can
be
liable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
of
course
it
isn't
home
free.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
individual
legislators
probably
have
a
perfect
defense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
schwartz,
i
used
to
serve
in
a
state
legislature,
and
i
can
remember
in
the
state
legislature,
because
of
personal
animosity
sometimes
a
position
would
be
eliminated
by
the
legislators.
they
didn't
like
somebody
who
was
holding
some
particular
office
in
some
agency,
and
the
way
around
it,
let's
get
rid
of
it,
and
they'd
just
legislate
it
out
of
existence.
now,
were
those
state
legislators
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
do
you
think,
when
they
did
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
so,
too.
[laughter]
let
me
ask
you
this.
is
there
any
difference
in
the
functions
being
carried
out
by
these
city
council
members
in
terms
of
enacting
the
legislation
than
what
i've
just
described
at
the
state
level?
i
mean,
it
looks
like
the
same
sort
of
thing.
not
that
we're
proud
of
it,
or
think
it's
good,
and
in
fact
it
was...
there
was
a
bad
motive
here,
but
isn't
it
the
same
conduct,
legislative
conduct
that
we're
dealing
with?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
see
why.
i
mean,
here
we
are
dealing
with
the
actual
enactment
of
a
city
ordinance,
presumably
within
the
powers
of
the
city.
they
didn't
have
to
do
it,
but
they
could.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
was
he
a
member
of
it
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
how
about
just
talking
about
the
enactment
of
local
ordinances.
let's
not
talk
about
their
action
when
they're
doing
something
else,
but
let's
talk
about
when
they're
enacting
a
local
ordinance.
that
just
seems
quintessentially
legislative
activity
to
me.
