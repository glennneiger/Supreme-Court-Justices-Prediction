justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
care
if
it
were
the
opposite.
i
mean,
as
you
define
legislation,
if
the
legislation
said
that
the
current
incumbent
of
this
office...
assuming
this
is
within
the
legislative
power,
you
would
still
say
that's
okay,
it's
legislation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
say
that
if
the
mayor...
if
you
accept
the
conclusion
of
justice
ginsburg's
question,
this
was
a
neat
way
around
liability,
you
would
say
precisely--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
is,
that
that's
simply
the
law,
that
you're
not
liable
for
legislative
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
saying,
i--
--do
you
think
have
we
achieved
something
for
municipal
government
if
we
acknowledge
your
immunity
for
individual
legislators
but
throw
open
suits
against
the
city
in
all
of
these
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
comforted
by
your
assurance
that
you
can
sue
the
city,
because
i'm...
you
know,
most
of
the
arguments
you
make
in
defense
of
your
clients
here
it
seems
to
me
are
makable
just
as
well
with
respect
to
the
city.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
serious
disruption
of
municipal
governance
if
you
could
claim
that
legislation
enacted
and
on
its
face
valid
was
motivated
for
improper
reasons.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
is
a
lot
harder.
i
mean,
he
has
to
get
a
whole
bunch
of
other
people
to
agree.
justice
antonin
scalia
right?
i
mean,
you...
it
isn't
as
easy
as
rolling
off
a
log,
so
that
you
can
avoid
liability
just
like
that,
by
getting...
you
have
to
get
it
through
the
city
council.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there
might
have
been
people
on
the
city
council
who
thought,
why
should
we
eliminate
this
department,
and
maybe
some
of
the
people
who
passed
it
thought
it
was
simply
a
good
idea
to
eliminate
the
department.
do
we
know
what
the
motivations
of
the
individual
legislators
on
the
city
council
were?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
maybe
some
of
them
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
get
rid
of
the
department.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
we
do
that
in
antitrust
laws.
i
mean,
justice
breyer
was
bringing
up
antitrust
in
another
situation.
an
action
which
an
individual,
if
he
took
on
his
own,
would
impose
serious
antitrust
liability,
if
he
walks
it
over
to
the
state
legislature
and
gets
a
law
passed,
lobbies
the
legislature
for
the
same
result,
it's
perfectly
okay,
so
it
doesn't
surprise
me
that
you
can
launder
some
pretty
bad
stuff
by
running
it
through
the
legislature.
we
do
it
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
like
libeling
somebody?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
clearly
unlawful
to
libel
somebody,
and
yet
i
don't
know
that
you
can
sue
legislators
for
libel.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
one
case?
i
mean,
your
opposing
counsel
says
that
you
have
not
come
up
with
a
single
case
where
a
state
legislator
was
held
liable...
a
municipal
legislator
was
held
liable.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
on
the
basis
of
the
mandatory
nondiscretionary
act
doctrine.
justice
antonin
scalia
on
that
alone,
which
you
don't
contend
it
exists
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
that's
what
you
mean
by
a
nondiscretionary
act,
every
time
a
legislature
is
alleged
to
have
violated
the
law,
it
will
have
been
alleged
to
have
violated
the
nondiscretionary
act
doctrine.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
law
is
the
law
is
the
law.
if
you're
violating
the
law,
you
had
no
option
but
not
to
violate
the
law.
i
mean,
you
know,
that
just
expands
it
to
such
a
degree
that
there's
nothing
left
of
the
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
the
immunity.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
its
effect
came
down
on
one
particular...
they
passed
a
law
that
eliminated
the
department.
the
department
is
no
more.
i
mean,
that
had
general
applicability,
certainly.
it
affects
a
lot
of
other
people,
i
suppose.
other
employees
who
used
to
be
employees
of
that
department
are
no
longer.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
well,
it
affects
people
who
in
the
future
would
have
been
that
one
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
unconstitutional
legislation
you
can
be
sued
for,
then.
are
you
saying
if
a
federal
legislator
passes...
votes
to
pass
an
unconsti...
a
statute
that
is
later
found
to
be
unconstitutional,
he
loses
all
of
his
immunity
for
that
whole
process
because,
although
it
seemed
to
be
legislation,
it
wasn't
really
legislation?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
don't
think
you
would.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
the
president,
if
he
proposed
that
legislation,
which
would
be--
justice
antonin
scalia
--parallel.
