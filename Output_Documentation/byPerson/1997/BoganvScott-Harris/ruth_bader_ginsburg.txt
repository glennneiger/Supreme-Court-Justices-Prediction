any
other
aspect?
i
thought
that
was
the
whole
thing.
the
department
was
just
created
so
that
this
other...
divisions
were
consolidated
so...
i
don't
understand
the
aspect
part
of
your
answer.
i
thought
the
only
thing
they
had
to
do
to
get
rid
of
the
department
was
to
get
rid
of
the
person
who
headed
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
only
legislative
thing,
whether
we
call
it
ultimately
legislative
or
administrative,
there
was
only
one
action,
and
that
was
to
end
the
position
of
head
of
hhs,
no
other
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
before
you
get
to
policy,
the
scope
of
this
absolute
immunity,
is
it
the
same
as
speech
or
debate
immunity
for
members
of
congress,
or
is
it
different
for
a
state
legislature,
a
regional
lawmaking
body,
a
municipal
lawmaking
body?
is
the
nature
of
the
absolute
immunity
the
same
as
we
go
down
the
ladder
from
federal
to
municipal?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
for
a
county
that
has
just
a
single
commissioner
who
is
both
the
executive
and
the
legislat--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
maybe
what
they
had
in
mind
is
if
the
mayor
just
said,
you're
discharged,
that
would
be,
quote,
administrative,
that's
not
legislative,
and
so
maybe
the
court
of
appeals
is
saying,
well,
that's
a
nice
way
to
get
around
liability
for
administrative
acts.
don't
say,
you're
fired.
get
the
city
council
to
pass
an
ordinance
that
says
she's
fired.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
rothfeld,
you
just
told
me
that
the...
it's
like
the
speech
or
debate
clause.
how
would
you...
if
the
city
is
the
defendant,
and
your
charge
is
this
thing
that
looks
neutral
on
its
face,
it's
just
a
budgetary
action,
we
eliminated
a
position,
how
do
you
prove
motive
except
by
questioning
the
people
whose
motives
are
tainted,
and
yet
the
speech
or
debate
clause
says,
shall
not
be
questioned
any
place.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i'm
not
comforted
by
your
quick
answer
that
yes,
the
city
would
be
liable.
you
need
to
prove
it,
and
you
need
to
prove
it
through
these
actors.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
at
least
it
is
an
open
question.
it's
not
so
clear
that
the
city
would...
you'd
have
to
answer
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
give
me
an
example.
here,
how
would
you
prove
that
this
city
council
passed
this
not
because
of
a
budget
crunch
but
because
they
wanted
to
get
rid
of
this
woman?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
think
that
the...
that
judge
sowerby
was
wrong
when
he
said,
ah,
but
that's
not
enough,
there's
nine
people
on
that
council,
and
you
tell
me
that
two
of
them,
you've
got
circumstantial
proof
with
respect
to
two
of
them,
you
can't
prove
a
claim
against
the
city
on
that
basis?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
isn't
that
part
of
the
legislative
process?
i
mean,
the
legislative
process
as
described
in
this
town
was
the
mayor
initiating
the
bill,
and
the
council
passes
it,
and
the
mayor
signs
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
it's
all
part
of
a
legislative
process.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you're
not
trying
to
say
that
every
time
the
mayor
proposes
a
bill
and
every
time
he
signs
it
he's
not
acting
in
a
legislative
capacity.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
but
in
your
response
to
justice
breyer
i
thought
you
contradicted
what
you
had
responded
to
me.
i
asked
you
about
the
mayor,
wasn't
he
performing
part
of
a
legislative
function
when
he
proposes
the
bill,
and
they
pass
it,
and
he
signs
it,
that's
all
part
of
a
legislative
process,
and
now
you're
trying
to
say,
no,
we
remove
the
legislative
stamp
from
the
mayor
but
not
the
council
member.
before,
you
were
emphasizing
it's
the
function
that
counts.
it's
a
legislative
process.
it
starts
with
initiating
a
bill,
the
bill
passes,
the
bill
gets
signed.
i
thought
maybe...
maybe
i
didn't
understand
your
answer
correctly,
but
i
thought
you
put
a
ring
around
that
as
the
legislative
process,
initiation,
passage,
signature.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case
it
might
have
been
very
easy,
or
just
as
easy,
or
even
easier
to
prove,
was
it
roderick
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--as
the
mayor.
so
i
don't
see
anything
inherent
about
the
mayor
that
makes
it
easier
to
prove
when
you
have
somebody
right
there
on
the
city
council
who
was
a
friend
of
the
offender,
the
alleged
offender.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
that
a
case
about
legislators'
absolute
liability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
private
bills
that
affect
only
one
person
not
legislation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
of
course
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
we
have
a
position
abolished.
