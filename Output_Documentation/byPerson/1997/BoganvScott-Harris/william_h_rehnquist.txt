chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1569,
daniel
bogan
v.
janet
scott-harris.
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
precisely
what
was
the
act
done
here?
i
perhaps
am
not
as
familiar
with
the
record
as
justice
o'connor
is.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
did
the
ordinance
provide?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
used
the
term,
administrate,
but
you
describe
the
common
law
immunity
as
extending
to
everything
except
ministerial
action,
and
i
think
the
word
administrative
connotes
a
much
broader
exception
than
the
term
ministerial,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
why
they
put
the
bill
of
attainder
clause
in
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
you're
prepared
to
accept
the
way
around
all
the
cases
that
you
can't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
whatever,
race,
politics,
or
any
other
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
also...
but
it's
also
limited
by
monell,
i
take
it,
that
perhaps
an
ordinance
might
be,
but
it
would
have
to
be
a
policy
type
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
schwartz.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
that
prove?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
the
two
are
mutually
exclusive,
and
what's
your
authority
for
saying
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
where
does
the
court's
functionality
test
that
you
refer
to,
where
does
that
come
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what's
the
matter
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
life.
i
mean,
the
members
of
congress
will
make
statements
on
the
floor
of
the
house
that
they
will
not
go
out
in
public
and
make,
because
in
one
case
they're
protected
by
speech
and
debate,
and
you
say,
well,
you
know,
why
do
they
do
that?
well,
they
prefer
to
do
something
in
a
way
that
gets
the
message
across
and
avoids
liability.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
are
you
trying...
you're
proposing
the
category
of
discretionary
on
the
one
hand
as
opposed
to
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
almost
obligatory.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
they
had
to
act
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
you
would
ever
refer
to
a
situation
where
a
person
was
forbidden
to
act
as
ministerial.
ministerial
that
you
had
an
obligation,
affirmative
obligation
to
do
something.
to
say
that
it
was
a
ministerial
act
because
you
were
forbidden
to
do
it
is
a
use
of
the
word
ministerial
i've
never
heard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
a
law
saying
that
no
member
of
the
communist
party
may
serve
as
an
officer
of
the
labor
union
is
not
legislation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
there's
a
definition
of
legitimate
legislation
which
is
narrower,
i
take
it,
than
the
definition
of
legislation
otherwise?
