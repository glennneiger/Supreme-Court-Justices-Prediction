mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
have
two
principal
points
to
make
this
morning.
the
first
is
that
state
and
regional
legislators
who
are
sued
under
section
1983
are
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
if
they
acted
in
their
legislative
capacities.
local
legislators
who
were
sued
under
the
statute
should
be
entitled
to
that
same
absolute
immunity
if
they
acted
in
their
legislative
capacities.
my
second,
and
closely
related
point,
is
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--sorry,
your
honor.
my
second
and
closely
related
point
is
that
public
officials
at
all
levels
of
government,
regional
officials,
state
officials,
and
local
officials,
do
act
legislatively,
and
therefore
are
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
when
they
propose
legislation,
vote
for
legislation,
and
enact
legislation.
now,
the
facts--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
court
of
appeals
did
accept
that
there
is
absolute
immunity
for
actions
that
are
taken
in
a
legislative
capacity,
and
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
on
that
point,
a
decision
that
i
add
was
endorsed
by
every
circuit.
i
think...
i
will
address
the
second
point
subsumed
within
my
suggestion
that
legislators
necessarily
act
legislatively
when
they
propose
legislation,
enact
legislation,
which
is
what
they
did
here.
there
was
a
dispute
in
the
court
of
appeals
as
to
whether
the
legislation
here
was
legislative
in
character
within
the
meaning
of
the
immunity
doctrine,
and
i
will
get
to
that
point.
as
i
say,
the
facts
that
underlie
this
are
simply
stated.
respondent
was
the
director
of
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
of
the
city
of
fall
river,
massachusetts.
the
mayor
of
fall
river
proposed
a
budget
which
eliminated
a
number
of
city
positions--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--certainly,
your
honor.
the
reason
i
was
touching
on
them
simply
is
because
i
think
they
provide
some
useful
context
for
the
legal
issue,
but
turning
directly
to
i
think
what's
the
first
underlying
issue
in
this
case,
are
legislators,
local
legislators
entitled
to
absolute
immunity--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--as
to
the
first,
i
think
the
law,
the
common
law
was
clearly
settled
in
the
19th
century.
i
think
that
it
was
the
established
rule,
unchallenged,
that
local
legislators
were
entitled
to
absolute
immunity
for
their
legislative
actions,
for
actions
of
the
sort
in
this
case.
we
have
searched
diligently.
we
have
not
found
a
single
19th
century
decision
holding
legislators
liable
for
discretionary
acts
related
to
the
enactment
of
legislation,
and
respondent
has
not
cited
such
a
case.
that
statement
of
the
law
was
reflected
in
the
leading
19th
century
treatises,
for
example,
cooley's
treatise
on
torts,
dillon's
treatise
on
municipal
corporations,
which
were
written
shortly
after
the
enactment
of
section
1983.
just
to
give
you
an
example
of
a
characteristic
statement,
cooley
in
his
treatise
on
torts,
written
in
1880,
says
that
so
far
as...
and
i'm
quoting
here
from
cooley.
so
far
as
legislative
officers
are
concerned,
their
rightful
exemption
from
liability
is
very
plain.
legislatures
have
complete
discretion
in
the
area
of
legislation,
and
it
is
not
consistent
with
this
that
their
members
should
be
called
to
account
for
their
acts
and
neglects.
this
is
also
true...
and
again
continuing
to
quote
cooley,
this
is
also
true
of
inferior
legislative
bodies
such
as
boards
of
supervisors,
county
commissioners,
city
councils,
and
the
like.
again,
we
have
searched
diligently.
we
have
not
found
a
single
19th
century
treatise
which
states
a
contrary
rule,
and
i
don't
believe
that
respondent
has
cited
one
either.
there
was
a
single
exception
to
this
rule
of
absolute
immunity
recognized
in
the
19th
century,
and
that
was
for
so-called
ministerial
acts.
there
was
a
body
of
authority
holding
that
local
legislators
could
be
called
to
account
for
failing
to
perform
ministerial
duties
that
were
imposed
by
state
law
or
by
court
order.
that
was
a
very
narrow
and
precisely
defined
doctrine.
it
applied
only
when
there
was
an
imperative,
nondiscretionary,
mandatory,
and
precise
duty,
as
i
say
imposed
either
by
state
law
or
by--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that...
we
have
searched
also
and
have
not
found
a
single
slander
case
against
a
member
of
a
local
legislative
body
for
statements
relating
to
their
legislative
actions.
respondent
in
her
brief
cites
a
number
of
decisions
which
we
addressed
in
our
reply
brief,
and
i
think
that
in
fact
none
of
them
involve
such
statements
by
local
legislators,
and
it
was
until
quite
recently,
it
may
still
be
the
common
law
rule,
prevailing
common
law
rule
that
local
legislators
have
immunity
in
defamation
suits
for
those
actions.
but
the
important
point
for
present
purposes
is
that
in
the
19th
century
so
far
as
we've
been
able
to
determine
there
were
no
such
suits,
and
so
i
think
it's
quite
clear...
returning
to
the
ministerial
point,
it's
quite
clear
that
the
actions
here,
the
actions
of
petitioners
in
this
case,
would
not
have
been
regarded
remotely
as
ministerial
in
the
19th
century,
and
respondent
does
not
contend
otherwise.
and
so
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
congress
that
enacted
section
1983
would
have
regarded
as
remarkable
the
suggestion
that
any
legislator
at
any
level
of
government
could
be
held
liable
for
actions
of
the
sort
in
this
case.
a
member
of
congress
in
1871
who
looked
at
the
background
of
common
law
would
have
seen
that
an
absolute
rule
of
liability
prevailed.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
the
acts
that
are
at
the
center
of
respondent's
case
are
proposing
an
ordinance,
voting
for
the...
supporting
the
ordinance
at
committee,
voting
for
the
ordinance,
and
then
the
mayor's
act
in
signing
the
ordinance.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
ordinance
eliminated
a
department
of
health
and
human
services
of
the
city
of
fall
river.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--yes,
at
this
point,
certainly,
justice
breyer
we
do
not
take
issue
with
the
jury's
determination.
the
issues
of
fact
were
sharply
disputed
at
trial,
but
certainly
for
present
purposes
we
accept
the
jury's
determination
that
there
was
a
wrongful
motivation
that
lay
behind
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--right.
if
i
may,
justice
breyer,
i'll
respond
to
the
chief
justice's
question
and
finish
with
my
response
to
justice
stevens,
and
then
turn
to
that,
which
is
the
second
half
of
the
argument.
the
ordinance
as
a
whole,
the
ordinance
that
was
enacted,
eliminated
the
department
of
health
and
human
services.
as
justice
breyer
has
indicated,
an
aspect
of
that
was
eliminating
the
position
of
director
of
the
department,
which
was
the
position
that
was
filled
by
respondent,
and
so
her
allegation,
which
was
accepted
by
the
jury,
is
that
the
motivation
for
enacting
that
ordinance,
and
that
portion
of
the
ordinance,
was
to
eliminate
her
position,
and
eliminate
her
as
a
city
employee.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
right.
well,
i...
they
actually,
as
a
consequence
of
eliminating
the
director
of
the
department
of
health
and
human
services
there
were
consequences
that
followed
from
that
for
the
organization
of
the
city
government.
there
were
other
city
officials
who,
under
the
ordinance
creating
the
department,
reported
to
the
director,
and
so
eliminating
the
position
of
the
director
required
various
other
steps
to
be
taken.
now,
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
right.
for
present
purposes
i
think
we
can
assume
that.
there
was
an
ordinance
which
eliminated
the
department
and
the
principal
consequence
of
that
was
eliminating
the
position
of
director
of
the
department,
although
i...
there
were
these
other
subsidiary
things
that
had
to
be
taken
care
of
when
that
was
done.
reserving
just
for
a
moment
the
question
of
whether
that
that
kind
of...
and
it's
clear
it
was
an
ordinance.
it
was
enacted
by
the
city
council.
it
was
signed
by
the
mayor.
it
was
recorded
in
the
official
ordinance
books
of
the
city.
reserving
for
the
moment
whether
that
legislation
is
legislative
in
character,
justice
stevens
asked
about
the
status
of
absolute
immunity
prior
to
the
court's
decision
in
lake
country
estates.
i
think
that
there
were
a
number
of
courts,
and
their
decisions
are
cited
by
respondent,
prior
to
that
decision
which
recognized
only
qualified
immunity
under
section
1983
for
local
legislators.
i
think
that
an
examination
of
those
decisions
shows
that
they
did
not...
i
think
did
not
benefit
from
the
court's
subsequent
decisions
setting
out
the
nature
of
the
immunity
inquiry
under
section
1983.
for
example,
they
did
not
look
at
all
at
the
common
law
history
that
prevailed
in
the
19th
century,
which
the
court
has
said
is
the
paramount
indicium
here,
and
it's
interesting
that
one
of
the
decisions
cited
by
respondents
was
written
by
then
judge
potter
stewart
on
the
sixth
circuit,
indicating
that
only
qualified
immunity
prevailed.
then
justice
stewart
i
think
changed
his
view,
because
he
joined
justice
powell's
dissenting
opinion
in
owen
v.
city
of
independence,
which
stated
expressly
that
members
of
city
councils
are
entitled
to
absolute
immunity,
and
so
i
think
that
the
law
has...
this
court's
immunity
doctrine
has
been
clarified
and
sharpened
and
every
court
of
appeals
has
now
concluded
that
an
absolute
rule
of
immunity
is
the
appropriate
one.
i
should
just
add
parenthetically
that
the
common
law
history,
which
i
think
is
quite
compelling,
is
confirmed
by
looking
at
the
considerations
of
policy
that
the
court
has
identified--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think,
your
honor,
the
nature
of
the
immunity
is
the
same.
the
court
has
described
the
test
for
legislative
immunity
at
least
as
for
regional
and
state
legislators
in
lake
country
estates
and
in
tenney
using
exactly
the
same
terms
as
it
has
used
in
the
speech
and
debate
clause
cases.
indeed,
the
court
has
cited
the
tenney
holding
as
the
nature...
as
the
test
for
speech
and
debate
clause
immunity,
and
so
i
think
that
the
immunity
is
identical
in
substance.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that
that
raises
the
difficult
problem
of
application.
let
me
say
just
preliminary
that
obviously
this
case
is
not
in
that
mold.
here
we
have
classic
legislation.
we
have
a
multi-member
representative
body
responsible
for
lawmaking
in
the
jurisdiction
that
passes
laws
that
are
signed
by
the
executive,
so
we
don't
face
that
problem.
i
think
that
the
unusual
forms
of
local
government,
and
you
suggest
one,
present
a
more
difficult
case,
but
i
think
that
if
the
single
member
is
acting
legislatively
by
promulgating
a
law,
promulgating
an
ordinance,
that
the
same
type
of
immunity
would
apply.
after
all,
the
same
polices
that
the
court
identified
in
lake
country
estates
and
in
tenney
as
necessitating
legislative
immunity
because
of
the
fear
that
prospective
liability
will
distort
legislative
decisionmaking,
because
of
the
fear
that
it
will
lead
to
distracting
and
burdensome
litigation,
because
of
the
fear
that
it
ultimately
would
discourage
people
from
public
service,
all
of
those
considerations
apply
to
all
types
of
municipal--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
as
the
court
has
said
repeatedly,
the
question
is
not
the
branch
in
which
the
local
official
or
a
public
official
serves,
or
the,
you
know,
the
source
of
their
salary,
or
their
title,
so
in
butz
v.
economu
an
executive
official
was
entitled
to
judicial
immunity
because
he
exercised
judicial
functions.
in
the
supreme
court
of
virginia
v.
consumers
union
case,
judges
were
entitled
to
legislative
immunity
because
they
were--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
and
i
think
that
what
the
mayor
did
here
was
clearly
legislative
in
character.
the
two...
the
acts
that
he
did,
proposing
the
legislation
and
signing
the
legislation,
are
essential
elements
of
the
legislative
process
of
enacting
the
law,
and
the
court
in
the
federal
context
has
described
the
president's
power
to
veto
or
to
sign
legislation
as
legislative
in
character.
the
court
has
said
that
that
is
an
explicit
exception
to
the
separation
of
powers
and
the
constitution,
and
so
in
cases
like
buckley
v.
valeo
and
others
that
we
cite
in
our
briefs,
the
court
has
expressly
said
that
power
is
a
law-making
legislative
power.
that
is
the
very
power
that
was
exercised
by
the
mayor
in
this
case,
and
so
i
think
that
as
a
functional
matter
it
was
legislative,
directed
to
the
enactment
of
a
law,
and
therefore
he
is
for
those
actions
entitled
to
absolute
legislative
immunity,
and
again,
all
the
considerations
the
court
identified
in
tenney,
lake
country
estates,
point
to
that
sort
of
immunity
in
this
case.
now,
if
that
is
correct,
and
if
absolute
immunity
is
the
proper
rule
for
local
legislators,
or
local
officials
acting
in
a
legislative
capacity,
the
remaining
question
in
this
case
is
justice
breyer's
question,
were
the
legislators
here
acting
in
a
legislative
way,
and
i
would
submit
that
the
court
of
appeals'
approach
to
that
has
a
slightly
lewis
carrollish
quality.
there
is
no
question
that
all
of
the
actions
taken
by
the
defendants
here,
as
i
say,
proposing
the
ordinance,
supporting
the
ordinance
in
committee,
voting
for
the
ordinance,
and
signing
the
ordinance,
were
directed
to
the
enactment
of
a
municipal
law,
to
an
ordinance.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
argument,
the
court
of
appeals
holding
in
this
case,
which
is
endorsed
by
respondent,
is
that
some
legislation
is
essentially
more
legislative
than
others,
that
legislation
does
not
have
a
legislative
quality
if
the
sponsors
are
motivated
by
specific
facts,
what
the
court
of
appeals
called
specific
facts,
or
if
the
legislation
is
excessively
narrow
in
scope,
if
it
affects
only
a
small
number
of
identifiable
persons.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
absolutely.
clearly
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
deriving
its
administrative
exception
from
the
common
law.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
ministerial
exception,
or
perhaps
the
immunity
that
prevailed
then.
i
think
the
court
of
appeals'
view,
and
respondent's
view,
is
that
legislation
which
is,
as
i
say,
based
on...
in
which
the
legislator's
motivation
is
based
on
what
the
court
called
specific
facts,
or
if
the
legislation
is
too
narrow,
that
legislation
is
simply
not
legislative
in
character,
even
though
it
is
a
duly
promulgated
law.
now--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
a
couple
of
points
in
response
to
that,
your
honor,
which,
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
question
that
goes
to
the
heart
of
respondent's
argument.
first
of
all,
just
as
a
matter
of
clarification
as
to
what
exactly
went
on
here,
the
city
council
did
not
say,
this
individual
is
fired.
the
city
council
eliminated
this
position
for
all
time,
so
that's
a
classic
legislative
action.
it
passed
a
law
providing
there
no
longer
is
this
position
in
the
city
government.
i
think
that
that
is
identical
to
what
would
occur
if,
for
example,
congress
passed
a
law
eliminating
funding
for
the
coming
fiscal
year
for
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
health
and
human
services.
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
would
say
that,
although
i--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--as
i
say,
there
are
a
number
of
points
to
make
in
response
to
that.
i
think...
first
of
all,
that
is
our
position,
that
if
the
legislative
body
passes
a
law,
whatever
it
says,
it
is
legislative
in
character.
now,
there
may
be
other
constitutional
defects
in
that
law.
it
may
be
a
bill
of
attainder.
it
may...
i
think
in
this
case
such
a
law
would
have
been
outside
the
city
council's
statutory
authority
under
massachusetts
law
and
under
its
own
city
council,
but
i
think
it
would
be
legislative
in
character,
and
if
you
look
at--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
city
certainly
can
be
liable
for
unconstitutional
actions,
and
i
think
that
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--absolutely.
absolutely.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true.
now,
in
fact,
actually
that
points
up
a
more
compelling
reason
for
immunity
in
the
local
context.
if
someone
is
aggrieved
by
that
kind
of
statute
at
the
state
level
they
may
have
no
remedy
at
all.
they
can't
sue
the
legislature.
it
clearly
is
immune
under
tenney
v.
brandhove,
and
they
can't
sue
the
state.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
precisely.
at
the
city
level
they
can
sue
the--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me
make--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--a
couple
of
points
in
response
to
that.
first
of
all,
if,
as
you
suggested
in
the
first
part
of
your
question,
the
city
council
actually
has
powers
to
appoint
and
fire
individuals--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if...
the
question
is,
would
such
a
thing
be
legislative
in
character.
look
at
what
would
happen--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--what
would
happen
if
congress
passed...
congress
passes
laws
all
the
time
that
are
intended
to
and
have
the
effect
of
affecting
only
one
person.
even
leaving
private
bills
aside,
tax
exemptions
that
are
aimed
at
one
person,
a
law
that
says,
chrysler
is
hereby
bailed
out
because
that's
in
the
public
interest--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
but--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--but
i
don't
admit
an
exception
for
that.
my
point
is
that
legislators
at
all
levels,
congress,
state
legislators,
regional
legislatures,
state...
local
legislatures
always
have
had
the
power,
the
legislative
authority
to
enact
specific
provisions
that
affect
only
an
individual,
that
affect
only
a
small
number
of
people
and
they
don't
lose
their
legislative
quality
simply
because
they
are
of
that
nature,
because--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--precisely.
there
would
be
no
necessity
for
such
a
clause--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--so
far
as--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
two
points,
your
honor.
so
far
as--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--exactly.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
exactly.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
my--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--my...
that
is
precisely
my
point,
stated
better
than
i
could
do
it.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think...
let
me
clarify
my
answer
to
you.
i
think
i
may
have
been
confused.
i
think
the
scope
of
the
immunity
is
identical
to
the
speech
and
debate
clause.
now,
whether
or
not
an
individual
could
be
sued,
could
be
called...
an
individual
local
legislator
could
be
called
to
testify
in
a
suit
against
a
third
party,
clearly
1983
immunity
would
not
preclude
them
from
being
called
for
that,
so
in
that
sense
there
is
no
section
1983
speech
and
debate
equivalent
immunity.
now,
whether
there
is
some
federal
evidentiary
privilege
that
would...
could
be
asserted
in
such
a
circumstance
has
not
been
determined
by
this
court
and
is
certainly
not
going
to
be
decided
by
this
case.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
second
part
of
my
answer
to
your
question,
justice
ginsburg,
is
that
there
are
many
ways
of
proving
legislative
motive
that
do
not
require
individual
testimony
by--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
in
ways
that
respondent
in
this
case
did
attempt
to
prove
that.
she
showed,
or
attempted
to
show,
that
there
had
been
altercations
between
herself
and
members
of
the
city
council
or
other
city
employees
that
were
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
city
council.
she
attempted
to
show
that
elimination
of
her
position
actually
was
a
ruse,
because
the
city
ended
up
spending
more
money
hiring
replacements
to
do
what
she
had
been
doing,
and
there
are
a
wide
range
of
circumstantial
indicia.
i
think
in
the
equal
protection
clause
area
this
court
has
indicated
justice
stevens--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
the
first
circuit
suggested
that
the
reason
the
case
came
out
this
way,
perhaps,
as
to
municipal
liability
is
the
manner
in
which
it
was
litigated,
that
respondent
made
virtually
no
attempt
to
demonstrate
by
any
means
the
motivations
of
these
other
members
of
the
city
council
and,
for
example,
one
could
imagine
that
a
plaintiff
in
a
case
like
this
might
try
to
show
that
there
is
an
individual
member
of
the
council,
like
the
chair
of
the
budget
committee,
who
is...
as
to
whom
everyone
defers
automatically,
and
that
is
essentially
a
de
facto
policymaker.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that,
i
think,
your
honor,
goes
to
the
substantive
nature
of
the
constitutional
violation
that's
being
alleged,
and
it
doesn't
turn
on
the
nature
of
municipal
liability.
i
mean,
the
court
has
crossed
the
bridge
of
municipal
liability
in
owen,
holding
that
municipalities
are
liable
for
their
unconstitutional
acts.
now,
if
acts
based
on
impermissible
motivation
are
unconstitutional--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
is
certainly
true.
if
i
may--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--if
i
can
give
you
a
short
answer
and
then
sit
down,
i
think
that
it
would
be
a
very
dangerous
thing
for
public
officials
if
it
were
possible
to
look
behind
the
form
of
the
legislation
and
say,
well,
maybe
on
the
face
of
it
this
does
not
in
terms
appear
unconstitutional,
but
there
were
facts
in
their
minds
which
render
it
unconstitutional
and
therefore
legislative
immunity
goes
by
the
boards
until
we
are
able
to
establish
the
nature
of
their
motivation.
once
you've
done
that,
immunity
is
swept
off
the
books
altogether,
because
you've
had
a
trial
and
you've
had
discovery
before
immunity
is
determined,
so--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
there
are...
as
i
suggest,
there
are
means
of
getting
at
the
motivation
of
the
jurist...
of
the
decisionmaking
entity
which
do
not
require
holding
them
liable,
which
is
the
only
issue
which
is
before
the
court
in
this
case.
and
if
i
may
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
have
a
couple
of
points
which
i
will
endeavor
to
make
quick.
first
of
all,
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
conceptualize
the
question
of
whether
this
is
legislative
action
in
this
case
is
to...
and
perhaps
it's
built
on
justice
o'connor's
example
from
arizona...
is
to
imagine
what
would
happen
if
this
happened
at
the
federal
level.
if
the
president
fired
the
secretary
of
hhs,
that
would
be
an
administrative
act.
if
congress
passed
a
bill
eliminating
funding
for
the
office
of
the
secretary
of
hhs
for
the
next
fiscal
year,
everybody
i
think
would
acknowledge
that
would
be
a
legislative
act,
and
that
the
members
of
congress
would
be
shielded
by
the
speech
and
debate
clause
if
the
incumbent
secretary
of
hhs
sued
them
on
a
first
amendment
theory.
this
case
i
think
is
identical
to
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
or
the
president,
if
he
proposed
that
legislation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
second,
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
and
respondent
acknowledge
that
if
this
facially
neutral
ordinance
had
been
promulgated
for
proper
reasons,
for...
purely
for
the
purpose
of
saving
money,
it
would,
in
fact,
be
legislative
in
character.
therefore,
their
test
requires
in
every
case
of
this
sort
that
there
be
a...
in
that
circumstance,
absolute
immunity
would
be
proper,
because
it
would
be
legislative
in
character.
their
test
requires
that
in
every
case
of
this
sort
there
be
an
examination,
therefore,
into
the
legislative
motive
before
an
inquiry
into
immunity
is
conducted.
that
means
that
there
has
to
be
discovery
and
a
trial
before
immunity
is
decided,
and
yet--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
not
if
there's
an
absolute
immunity
rule
for
acts
that
are
in
the
form
of
legislation,
as
we
suggest.
if,
having
passed
a
law
that
determines
that
it
is
legislative
in
character,
then
i
think
at
that
point
absolute
immunity
applies,
and
there's
no
need
for
an
inquiry
into
motive,
otherwise
immunity
really
becomes
entirely
meaningless,
because
in
every
case
of
this
sort
there
will
be
a
possibility
to
argue
that
we...
there
was
a
specific
fact
in
the
minds
of
the
legislators,
and
i
should
be
entitled,
the
plaintiff
will
say,
to
obtain
discovery
into
those
facts,
and
therefore
immunity
goes
by
the
boards.
the
third
point,
relating
to
owen,
which
was
cited
by
respondent,
i
think
owen
has
no
bearing
in
this
case.
the
court
suggested,
looking
at
the
common
law
history
in
owen,
that
the...
there
was
a
discretionary
immunity
for
acts
of
municipalities
because
common
law
judges
were
unwilling
to
substitute
their
judgments,
their
discretionary
judgments
for
municipal
acts
in
areas
of
the
municipalities'
proper
purview.
the
rationale
for
legislative
immunity
is
quite
distinct.
the
idea
there
is
that
legislators
should
not
be...
should
not
have
distorted
judgment
because
of
fear
of
liability,
and
therefore
any
act...
thank
you,
your
honor.
