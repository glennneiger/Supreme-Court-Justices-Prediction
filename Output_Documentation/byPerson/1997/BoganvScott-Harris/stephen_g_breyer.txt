justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can't
hear
you
very
well.
i
can't
hear
you
at
all.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
going
to
at
some
point
address
the
court
of
appeals'
reason
for
address...
for
your
losing,
which
i
didn't
hear
in
either
of
the
first
two
points,
because
i
thought
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
both
of
those
points.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
that
what...
the
particular
action
they're
talking
about
is
section
22
of
the
ordinance,
which
reads,
by
striking
out
the
following
in
section
16-239
the
words,
administrator
of
health
and
human
services--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--right,
and
there's
a
jury
finding,
i
take
it,
that
those
words
that
i've
just
quoted
are
in
this
ordinance
because
the
defendant's
stated
reason
was
wrong.
it
wasn't
their
real
reason.
the
real
reason
those
words
find
their
way
into
this
ordinance
is
because
they
wanted
the
defendant
to
take
action
against
the
plaintiff
on
the
basis
of
her
speech.
i
mean,
those--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
jury
findings,
right,
so
don't
we
have
to
take
those
as
the
facts?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
my...
of
course,
my
question
would
be...
and
i
want
you
to
continue
with
the
chief
justice's
answer,
but
the
question
arising
out
of
those
facts
for
me
is,
why
are
those
legislative
acts?
why,
in
these
circumstances,
aren't
these
particular
words,
and
given
the
way
they
found
their
way
into
this
bill
and
that
they
concerned
one
person
and
the
removal
of
that
one
person
from
her
job,
why
aren't
those
words
in
these
circumstances
an
administrative
action,
which
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
found?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
but
you
can't
sue
the
city
if
on
its
face...
i
mean,
what
i'm
thinking
about
is
there
are
many
different
forms
of
local
government.
in
some,
probably
local
councilors
do
all
the
hiring
and
firing,
and
think
of
the
court's
cases
like
rutan,
et
cetera,
or
the
court's
cases
you
can't
discriminate
against
members
of
the
opposite
political
party.
it
would
be
very
simple.
instead
of
the
administrator
of,
let's
call
it
a
city
beginning
with
c
decides
that
we're
going
to
fire
10,000
people
who
belong
to
a
political
party,
the
name
of
which
begins
with
an
r
or
a
d,
here's
what
we'll
do,
we
simply
run
it
through
the
city
council.
that's
simple.
we
recommend
an
ordinance,
simplest
thing
in
the
world,
and
therefore
all
those
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
you
can't
do
this,
or
you
can't
do
that
administratively,
all
we'll
have
to
do
at
the
local
level
is
run
it
through
the
city
council,
and
instead
of
doing
it,
we
just
call
it
a
recommendation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
end
of
those
cases,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
they'll
do
it
by
temporarily
eliminating
the
position.
i
mean,
we
have
a
hiatus
in
the
position,
we
rename
it,
and
we
hire
a
different
person.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
are
you
going
to
look
through
that
subterfuge
which,
after
all,
takes
the
same
form.
it
takes
the
form
of
legislation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
the
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
but
now,
once
you're
down
that
track,
once
you
admit
an
exception
to
the
absolute
rule
of
the
form
of
legislation,
then
this
looks
like
a
pretty
good
case
for
that
exception,
doesn't
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
there
are
jury
findings
that
this
one
person
was
really
being
dismissed
in
this
way
because
of
her
speech.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
as
long
as
it's
run
through
the
city
council.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no
matter
how
egregious,
it's
home
free.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
against
the
municipality,
what
bothers
me...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this.
the...
on
your
approach,
you
take
legislation
that's
neutral
on
its
face,
and
you
hold
the
city
liable
if
it's
passed
for
an
unconstitutional
motive,
which
brings
you
into
a
very
big
problem
of
how
you
prove
motive
for
individual
legislators,
how
many,
et
cetera.
that
was
what
was...
all
right.
well
then,
isn't
it
easier
just
to
segregate
out
those
actions
which
are
really
administrative
in
nature
for
the
municipality?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
there's
no
liability?
what
is
your
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
possible
there's
a
distinction
between
the
two
defendants,
one
being
a
member
of
the
city
council
and
the
other
not,
so
that
when,
in
fact,
even
if
you
have
anything
that...
even
if
you
were
to
say,
whatever
takes
the
form
of
an
ordinance
in
a
city
council
is
legislation,
you
wouldn't
necessarily
have
to
say
that
as
to
the
person
who
proposes
to
the
city
council
an
ordinance
that
takes
the
form
of
but
does
not
in
reality
seem
to
amount
to
legislative
rather
than
administrative
action?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
best
authority
for
the
proposition
that
you
just
made?
you
said
the
law
of
immunity
has
traditionally
treated
local
legislators
differently
from
state
legislators,
or
you
said
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
can
you
give
me
your
best
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean...
yes,
but
i
want
to
read
all
this,
so
if
you
just
tell
me
what
the
cases
are,
or
where
you
got...
or
what
part
of
your
brief,
even,
has
them
listed.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
amy?
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me...
just
give
me
enough
of
a
clue.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
can
jot
it
down
and
read
it
later.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
does
it
say,
when
you
have
like
a
town
meeting
in
new
england,
and
every
two
hundredth
resident
is
there,
and
you
say,
all
right,
now,
this
week
we're
going
to
buy
pencils,
and
we're
going
to
next
week
hire
somebody,
and
all
these
little
local
actions,
i
never
knew
whether
they're
administrative
or
legislative
or
what
they
are,
and
i
can't
remember
what
the
form
would
be.
what
does
it
say
at
the
top
of
the
page?
does
it
say,
ordinance?
i
don't
know
what
it
says.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
know
there
are
vast
numbers
of
details
that
i
think
are
run
through
selectmen,
and--
