mr.
ivars
berzins
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
what
the
government
advocates
defeats
the
policies
and
purposes
of
the
privilege,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
said
in
all
the
cases
that
followed
murphy.
the
government
wants
to
extract
from
my
client
testimony
that
is
designed
to
impose
criminal
penalties
on
him.
they
are
trying
to
get
him
to
testify
without
any
grant
of
immunity,
under
naked
compulsion,
to
extract
out
of
him,
out
of
his
mouth
the
testimony
that
will
inflict
criminal
penalties
on
him.
mr.
ivars
berzins
yes,
your
honor,
the
united
states
could
pass
such
a
law.
mr.
ivars
berzins
that
is
quite
so,
your
honor,
but
i
invite
you
to
consider
the
cruel
trilemma
that
faces
the
claimant
to
the
privilege.
it
is
the
cruel
trilemma
that
i
submit
to
you
the
constitution
prohibits.
mr.
ivars
berzins
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
submit
to
you
that
the
self-incrimination
clause
prohibits
compulsion,
and
that
the
framers
had
in
mind
precisely
the
compulsion
that
is
about
to
be
visited
upon
my
client.
mr.
ivars
berzins
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
government
is
not
powerless
to
help
itself
if
it
really
wants
my
client's
testimony.
they
certainly
have
the
means
of
getting...
either
not
deporting
him
or
getting
pardons
or
immunity
from
the
states
to
which
the
government
wants
to--
mr.
ivars
berzins
--your
honor,
my
client
is
not
asking
for
immunity.
my
client
is
merely
asking
that
he
not
be
compelled
to,
out
of
his
own
mouth
to
admit
to
criminal...
to
admit
to
acts
that
will
inflict
criminal
penalties
upon
him.
mr.
ivars
berzins
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
quite
so.
an
inference
can
be
drawn
from
his
mere
exercise
of
the
privilege.
the
cases
have
so
held.
mr.
ivars
berzins
he's
very
old,
your
honor.
my
math
fails
me
right
now.
mr.
ivars
berzins
yes,
your
honor.
the
government
claims
that
it
has
no
effective
way
to
grant
immunity.
i'd
like
to
address
that,
if
i
may.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
government
has
the
means
to
address
foreign
governments
and
it
has
the
means
to
enter
into
treaties
and
other
arrangements
that
might
be
coextensive
with
the
privilege,
and
also
i
submit
to
you
that
the
compulsion
is
precisely
what
the
framers
wanted
to
preclude
by
the
very
plain
language
of
the
amendment.
and
the
crux
of
this
case,
i
submit
to
you,
is
on
page
13
of
the
government's
reply
brief
where,
in
footnote
4,
i
believe,
they
very
plainly
admit...
and
i
certainly
thank
them
for
this
admission...
that
they
do
not
have
sufficient
evidence
to
charge
my
client
with
anything,
that
they
have
to
compel
him
to
incriminate
himself,
that
they
have
to
compel
him
to
confess
before
they
can
proceed.
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
exactly
what
the
framers
wanted
to
preclude.
mr.
ivars
berzins
your
honor,
the
cruel
trilemma--
mr.
ivars
berzins
--yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
prospect
of
a
criminal
proceeding
in
the
united
states,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
it
makes
no
difference
where
the
criminal
proceeding
takes
place.
the
compulsion
doesn't
become
any
different
whether
the
compulsion
takes
place
in
california
and
the
criminal
trial
takes
place
in
calcutta.
mr.
ivars
berzins
it
makes
no
difference
to
the
claimant.
mr.
ivars
berzins
no,
your
honor.
the
theory
in
kastigar,
though,
should
be
read
in
the
context
of
kastigar,
where
there
was
no
claim
of
a
foreign
criminal
prosecution
raised.
it
dealt
with
the
state
prosecution.
mr.
ivars
berzins
yes,
your
honor,
i
do
in
the
context
in
which
it
was
given,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
murphy
can
stand
independent
of
the
application
of
the
fifth
amendment
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
to
the
states.
mr.
ivars
berzins
your
honor,
i
submit
that
the
case
could
come
out
as
i
advocate
it
if
the
court
adopts
the
view
that
the
personal
liberties
component
as
explained
in
murphy
is
a
very
important
one,
and
that
it
cannot
be
brushed
aside
merely
because
the
infliction
of
criminal
penalties
will
take
place
elsewhere.
the
fear
is
here.
the
article
iii
compelling
court
is
here.
the
claimant
is
here.
all
of
this
takes
place
in
the
united
states.
it
is
just
a
coincidence
that
the
criminal
penalties
will
be
inflicted
elsewhere.
mr.
ivars
berzins
your
honor,
i
would,
and
i
would
object
for
the
reasons
stated
by
the
district
court
in
this
case
as
well
as
in
the
gecas
case
and,
as
i
recall,
the
reasons
were
the
sealing
order
really
cannot
be
made
coextensive
with
the
privilege.
that
has
been
recognized
as
a
very
difficult
prospect
in
light
of
all
the
newspaper
articles
we
read
about
grand
jury
leaks,
et
cetera.
and
even
more
concern
to
me
is
what
would
happen
if
there
is
a
sealing
order,
my
client
gets
deported
overseas,
and
then
the
leaks
come
out
overseas.
obviously
there
is
no
way
that
that
situation
can
be
remedied.
it's
too
late.
mr.
ivars
berzins
yes,
your
honor,
but
i
submit
we
ought
not
be
concerned
with
what
the
procedural
systems
are
that
might
compel
it.
i
submit
to
you
that
we
should
be
concerned
with
the
compulsion
here,
not
with
what
happens
to
the
compulsion
overseas.
we
cannot
help
the
compulsion
that
may
occur
in
some
other
country.
the
fifth
amendment
does
not,
i
submit,
protect
against
other
compulsions
and
other
disabilities
and
other
harms,
only
against
infliction
of
criminal
penalties,
and
that,
i
submit,
is
what
ought
to
be
guarded
against,
and
i
submit
that
is
a
liberty
interest
that
should
be
recognized
as
a
very
important
one.
as
i
submit,
the
murphy
court
in
its
explanation
highlighted
it
very
prominently,
and
on
that
basis
i
ask
you
to
recognize
it
when
the
obvious
fear
of
infliction
of
criminal
penalties
is
real.
mr.
chief
justice
raised
the
question
about
administrative
difficulties.
thus
far
i
do
not
believe
administrative
difficulties
have
been
encountered
in
these
cases,
because
the
burden
has
always
been
upon
the
claimant
to
establish
precisely
what
it
is
that
he
fears
and
what
are
the
realistic
chances
of
him
winding
up
before
a
criminal
court
where
the
criminal
penalties
will
be
inflicted.
mr.
ivars
berzins
mr.
chief
justice,
that
was
extensively
handled
in
the
district
court,
and
it
was...
in
each
case
it
is
a
claimant's
burden
and
it's
a
heavy
one
under
the
flanigan
case
in
the
second
circuit.
it's
a
whole
litany
of
things
that
the
claimant
has
to
prove
before
he
can
have
any
chance
of
having
the
privilege
recognized.
mr.
ivars
berzins
but
i
submit
to
you
that
the
difficulty
is
upon
the
claimant,
not
upon
the
courts.
mr.
ivars
berzins
admittedly,
the
district
court
may
have
to
spend
some
time
on
it,
but
it's
up
to
the
claimant
to
bring
to
the
district
court
every
last
piece
of
evidence
on
which
he
relies
and
which
will
establish
his
claim
as
being
a
legitimate
claim
as
distinguished
from
a
fanciful
or
contrived
claim,
and
that
burden
is
upon
the
claimant,
and
once
the
claimant
establishes
it,
i
submit
the
privilege
ought
to
be
permitted
to
be
invoked,
because
the
alternative
is
the
cruel
trilemma
to
which
i
must
again
return
and
urge
you
to
recognize
it
from
the
standpoint
of
the
claimant.
it
makes
no
difference
to
him
where
he
will
spend
his
time
in
jail.
if
the
jail
is
overseas,
or
if
the
gallows
are
overseas,
it's
a
criminal
penalty
from
his
point
of
view,
and
from
his
point
of
view
the
liberty
interest
is
definitely
infringed
upon.
mr.
ivars
berzins
well,
your
honor,
i
think
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head.
[laughter]
but
that
does
not
minimize
the
constitutional
claim
that
we're
advocating.
we're
advocating
that
this
court
recognize
the
individual
liberties
component
as
it
was
so
eloquently
explained
in
murphy,
and
i
submit
to
you
that
individual
liberties
component,
if
it
is
recognized,
as
being
a
very
important
component
of
the
privilege.
mr.
ivars
berzins
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
so,
but
this
court
has
in
a
long
line
of
cases
since
murphy
reiterated
this
liberty
aspect
and
used
very,
very
strong
language
in
saying
that
the
liberty
aspect
of
the
privilege
is
important.
it's
not--
mr.
ivars
berzins
--that
may
very
well
come
to
pass,
your
honor,
but
nevertheless,
while
he
is
here,
and
while
he
is
subject
to
an
article
iii
court,
that
article
iii
court
ought
not
compel
him
to
convict
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth,
not
here
in
this
country.
what
happens
in
lithuania,
we
can't
control,
but
we
can
control--
mr.
ivars
berzins
--that
is
quite
so,
but
the
incrimination,
the
testimony
coming
out
of
the
claimant's
own
mouth,
that
i
submit
violates
the
privilege,
because
he's
being
compelled
here
without
a
grant
of
immunity.
every
case
where
immunity
has
been
granted,
and
the
claimant
has
been
forced
to
testify,
the
fear
of
the
criminal
penalties
has
been
eliminated.
but
if
the
fear
of
the
criminal
penalties
is
not
eliminated,
i
submit
that
the
violation
is
there
regardless
of
where
the
infliction
takes
place.
it
is
the--
mr.
ivars
berzins
--your
honor,
characterizing
it
as
a
superprivilege,
i
don't
want
to
join
in
that
characterization.
i
would
prefer
to
characterize
it
as
giving
full
application
to
the
privilege,
not
super.
it's
really
not
super.
he
is
not...
he
is
not...
the
claimant
is
not
being
given
anything
that
he
shouldn't
have,
because
if
his
fear
is
legitimate,
if
the
criminal
penalties
are
there,
i
really
don't
see
that
it
is
superprotection.
i
think
it
is
the
protection
that
the
framers
had
in
mind.
mr.
ivars
berzins
your
honor,
my
response
is
that
obviously
there
will
be
cases
where
the
government
will
not
be
able
to
either
grant
immunity
or
get
the
foreign
government
to
cooperate
in
granting
a
pardon,
or
issuing
its
own
immunity,
or
whatever.
there
obviously
will
be
cases,
but
i
submit
to
you
that
those
cases
will
be
far
and
few,
and
they
really
ought
not
be
what
turns
this
issue.
mr.
ivars
berzins
well,
your
honor,
i
am...
i
am
really
prefacing
my
answer
based
on
the
past.
i
have
not
seen
that
in
the
past
it
has
arisen
that
often.
maybe
in
the
future
it
will,
but
in
the
past,
these
claimants
who
have
made
claim
to
the
privilege
under
similar
circumstances,
the
majority
of
them
have
lost.
mr.
ivars
berzins
it
seems
to
me
that
they
would
be
if
they
are
coextensive
with
what
we
would
consider
equivalent
to
immunity
that
can
be
granted
here.
mr.
ivars
berzins
your
honor,
the
obstacles
will
be
practical
and
diplomatic,
but
i
have
a
lot
of
faith
in
our
government.
they
can
do
miracles,
and
if
they
have
to
they
will
accomplish
them
here
also.
mr.
ivars
berzins
is
there
anything
else
that
i
can
be
of
assistance
to
this
court
with?
mr.
ivars
berzins
thank
you.
