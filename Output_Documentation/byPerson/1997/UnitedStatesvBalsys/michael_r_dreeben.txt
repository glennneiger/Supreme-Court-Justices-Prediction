mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compelled
self-incrimination
may
be
invoked
based
on
a
fear
of
foreign
prosecution.
for
three
main
reasons,
we
submit
that
it
may
not.
first,
the
prohibition
against
compelling
a
person
to
be
a
witness
against
himself
applies
only
in
a
criminal
case.
by
that
phrase,
the
framers
meant
a
federal
criminal
case.
the
self-incrimination
clause
is
one
of
a
series
of
rights
set
forth
in
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendments
that
are
naturally
read
to
govern
criminal
trials
in
this
country,
not
foreign
criminal
cases.
second,
history
teaches--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
this
respect.
the
privilege
may
be
claimed
by
a
witness
in
any
proceeding,
regardless
of
whether
the
proceeding
is
civil,
criminal,
or
administrative,
so
long
as
what
the
witness
ultimately
fears
is
incrimination
in
a
criminal
case.
the
proper
referent
to
determine
whether
the
self-incrimination
clause
may
be
invoked
therefor
is
not
the
type
of
proceeding
in
which
it
is
claimed
in
this
country,
but
rather
the
type
of
proceeding
in
which
the
witness
actually
fears
incrimination,
and
that
point
is
borne
out
by
the
history
of
the
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
could
be,
justice
ginsburg,
if
these
statements
had
been
made
within
a
period
prosecutable
under
the
statute
of
limitations,
but
the
original
statements
that
respondent
made
to
gain
entry
to
the
united
states
were
in
1963,
and
the
general
5-year
statute
of
limitations
has
long
since
run
on
any
prosecution
for
false
statements
based
on
that
event
and,
as
a
result,
the
witness
is
not
in
a
position
to
claim
a
fear
of
domestic
incrimination
based
on
any
contradiction
with
his
prior
statements
and
i
think
it's
conceded
in
this
case
that
the
only
claim
of
self-incrimination
is
based
on
what
a
foreign
power
might
do
if
it
had
custody
over
respondent
and
instituted
a
case.
there
is
no
claim
in
this
case
that
there
is
a
domestic
fear
of
prosecution
by
either
the
state
or
the
federal
government
based
on
the
statements
that
he
has
made.
now,
the
history
of
the
self-incrimination
clause
in
this
country
points
strongly
to
the
conclusion
that
the
words,
any
criminal
case,
in
the
fifth
amendment
refer
only
to
a
federal
criminal
case.
in
the
era
before
this
court
extended
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i'm
not
sure,
justice
scalia,
whether
i
was
clear
before,
so
let
me
try
to
make
it
clear.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
case
in
which
the
incrimination
must
take
place--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--must
be
a
criminal
case,
by
which
the
fifth
amendment
in
our
view
means
a
federal
criminal
case.
the
privilege
can
be
claimed
by
a
witness
in
any
proceeding
in
which
he
is
asked
to
give
compelled
testimony,
not
based
on
his
concerns
about
what
might
happen
to
him
in
that
proceeding,
but
based
on
concerns
about
what
might
happen
to
him
in
a
criminal
case
down
the
road.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
yes.
the
compulsion
can
be
in
the
case
in
which
you
are
compelled
to
give
testimony
under
oath,
as
in
this
case,
in
our
view,
by
a...
backed
by
the
contempt
powers
of
the
court
if
you
decline
to
give
testimony,
so
the
compulsion
can
occur
in
any
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
you
need
also
to
have
incrimination.
the
two
interlinked
requirements
of
the
clause
are
compulsion
and
incrimination,
and
the
question
here
is
whether
the
incrimination
can
be
in
a
case
not
brought
in
this
country
by
the
federal
government
or
a
state,
but
by
a
foreign
government.
that
is
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
exactly
right.
the
question
is
whether
it
can
be
triggered
based
on
prosecution
abroad.
now,
if
you
look
at
the
text
of
the
fifth
and
the
sixth
amendments
together,
which
is
the
logical
way
to
read
them
because
they
contain
the
essential
criminal
procedure
proscriptions
that
are
applicable
in
trials
in
this
country,
the
fifth
amendment
seems
almost
inevitably
to
be
limited
to
criminal
cases
brought
by
the
federal
government.
there
can
be
no
dispute
that
the
original
intent
of
the
framers
of
the
bill
of
rights
was
to
impose
limitations
only
on
the
federal
government,
not
on
the
states,
and
this
court
consistently
held,
in
the
era
before
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
ratified
and
thereby
made
certain
constitutional
protections
applicable
to
the
states,
that
none
of
the
provisions
in
the
original
bill
of
rights
govern
state
proceedings
and,
as
a
result,
state
witnesses
could
not
claim
the
protection
of
the
fifth
amendment.
in
that
regime,
in
other
words,
state
witnesses
who
feared
incrimination
by
a
state
could
not
say
that
they
feared
incrimination
in
any
criminal
case,
because
state
prosecutions
were
not
deemed
subsumed
within
the
fifth
amendment,
and
there
are
several
textual
references
that
make
sense
only
if
read
that
way.
the
sixth
amendment
refers
to
all
criminal
prosecutions,
yet
it
is
quite
clear
that
by
that
reference
the
framers
did
not
intend
to
refer
to
state
criminal
prosecutions,
and
far
less
sensible
would
it
be
to
think
that
they
were
referring
to
foreign
criminal
prosecutions.
the
only
criminal
prosecutions
that
were
originally
subsumed
by
the
sixth
amendment
were
domestic
criminal
prosecutions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
what
it
goes
to
is
by
what
did
the
framers
mean
the
words,
any
criminal
case,
to
refer
to?
originally
they
only
meant
them
to
refer
to
a
federal
criminal
case
and,
as
a
result,
this
court
held
that
if
a
federal
witness
was
compelled
to
testify,
he
said,
look,
i
don't
have
any
concern
that
i'm
going
to
be
incriminated
in
a
federal
criminal
case,
but
i
am
worried
that
in
the
state
of
maryland
i
might
be
incriminated.
this
court
held
that
is
not
a
basis
for
declining
to
give
testimony,
because
the
criminal
case
in
which
you
fear
incrimination
is
not
a
federal
criminal
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
ginsburg,
it
always
has
mattered
where
the
criminal
case
is,
and
once
this
court
held
in
malloy
v.
hogan
that
the
fifth
amendment
applied
equally
to
the
states
and
to
the
federal
government,
this
court
in
the
murphy
decision
changed
the
former
federal
rule
and
held
that
the
fifth
amendment
may
now
be
claimed
whether
the
prosecution
that
is
feared
would
occur
in
a
state
or
in
the
federal
government.
the
theory
behind
that
is
that
any
jurisdiction
that
is
bound
by
the
fifth
amendment
should
not
be
able
to
receive
testimony
that
was
compelled
by
another
jurisdiction,
also
bound
by
the
fifth
amendment,
and
use
it
to
convict
someone.
so
under
the
murphy
decision
two
jurisdictions,
each
bound
by
the
fifth
amendment,
cannot
evade
that
constitutional
guarantee
by
having
one
compel
the
testimony
and
the
other
one
use
it,
but
that
is
a
value
that
primarily
relates
to
the
way
we
try
criminal
cases
in
this
country.
like
the
presumption
of
innocence
and
the
requirement
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
the
fifth
amendment
fits
into
a
mosaic
of
rights
that
express
the
view
that
it
is
the
government
that
must
prove
the
defendant's
guilt
without
the
assistance
of
compelling
the
defendant
to
incriminate
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth
and
thereby
confess
himself
into
a
federal
or
a
state
prison.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
the
components
that
this
court
has
identified
as
a
value
underlying
the
fifth
amendment,
but
it
again
relates
primarily
to
a
value
about
how
we
prosecute
individuals
in
this
country.
it
says
nothing
about
whether
another
country
might
choose
to
adopt
a
different
criminal
law
system.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
to
the
extent
that
one
identifies
an
interest
in
individual
dignity
or
autonomy,
it
does
not
extend
so
far
as
to
say
the
government
cannot
exert
compulsion.
by
granting
immunity--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct.
the
government
has
always
had
the
countervailing
ability
to
grant
immunity
and
then
to
compel
an
individual
to
say
anything
about
himself
that
he
knows
honestly,
no
matter
how
offensive
it
is
to
him
personally,
no
matter
whether
it
would
subject
him
to
personal
humiliation
or
jeopardy
of
life.
so
long
as
it's
not
used
against
him,
those
words--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
that
is
exactly
right,
justice
kennedy.
it
is
not
a
freestanding
interest.
it's
an
interest
that
it
is
integrally
interlinked
with
the
potential
for
incrimination,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
it's
settled
that
the
federal
government
has
the
authority
under
the
supremacy
clause
to
declare
that
testimony
that
is
compelled
will
not
be
used
against
an
individual
in
a
state
proceeding.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
i
think
is
settled
by
the
kastigar
decision,
by
the
murphy
decision,
by
brown
v.
walker,
and
by
adams
v.
maryland.
i
believe
we
cited
all
of
these
cases
in
our
brief
that
specifically
address
the
federal
government's
power
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
certainly--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
in
a
case
like
this
the
justice
department
has
dual
interests.
there
is
a
federal
law
that
provides
for
the
deportation
of
an
individual
who
lied
to
get
into
this
country
and
who
assisted
the
nazis
in
persecuting
jews
during
world
war
ii,
and
that
is
a
distinct
federal
interest
that
is
being
enforced
by
osi.
it
is
also
true
that
osi
regards
it
as
a
proper
component
of
its
mission
to
see
to
it
that
information
that
may
be
relevant
to
a
foreign
government's
consideration
of
prosecution
is
provided.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
don't
think
it
should
make
any
difference
whatsoever,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
underlying
question
here
is
not
whether
it
would
be
fair
in
a
united
states
prosecution
to
use
this
information.
the
question
is
whether
the
united
states
constitution
has
something
to
say
about
the
way
foreign
governments
conduct
their
prosecutions.
there
is
no
country
that
i'm
aware
of
that
has
a
fifth
amendment
right,
or
a
mirror
image
of
the
fifth
amendment
right
that
looks
just
like
ours.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
don't,
justice
scalia.
my
understanding
is
that
we
provide
sufficient
information
to
the
foreign
government
and
ask
them
to
provide
information
to
a
witness
when
we
are
seeking
testimony
from
overseas
about
applicable
privileges.
now,
the
traditional
rule
about
how
the
privileges
are
supposed
to
be
applied
when
countries
cooperate
in
securing
testimony
is
that
the
foreign
country
will
take
the
testimony
subject
to
any
claim
of
privilege,
and
then
the
privilege
is
adjudicated
in
the
home
country
where
the
privilege
actually
derives
from,
but
it
is
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--right,
but
it
is
not
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
true,
justice
ginsburg.
it's
not
the
policy
of
the
united
states
government
to
seek
to...
that
that
happen
in
every
case
and,
as
a
result,
i'm
not
aware
of
instances
where
we
did
have
a
foreign
government
act
as
our
agent,
compelling
testimony
that
would
be
prohibited
if
the
united
states
were
acting
alone.
obviously,
that
raises
a
somewhat
separate
question
from
the
question
here,
which
is
whether
the
united
states
may
use
an
agent
or
an
intermediary
to
accomplish
something
that
it
cannot
accomplish
acting
directly,
but
that
is
an
entirely
separate
question
from
whether
a
witness
in
this
country
in
a
domestic
u.s.
proceeding
may
claim
the
fifth
amendment
based
not
on
a
fear
of
prosecution
here,
but
by
a
fear
of
what
might
happen
to
him
if
he
is...
finds
himself
in
a
foreign
country
and
the
testimony
ends
up
there.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
does
make
no
difference,
justice
ginsburg,
because
again,
i
think
that
the
fundamental
concern
of
the
fifth
amendment
and
as
applied
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
how
we
conduct
our
criminal
prosecutions
here.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it's
different
because
ohio,
unlike
lithuania,
is
bound
by
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
against
compelled--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
liberty,
i
think,
in
your
hypothetical
is
ultimately
freedom
from
incarceration.
the
question
is
whether
ohio
may
use
the
information
that
illinois
has
extracted
for
purposes
of
prosecution,
and
this
court
in
the
murphy
decision
attempted
to
make
sense
out
of
our
federal
system
in
which
all
jurisdictions
are
bound
by
the
fifth
amendment
by
saying
that
two
jurisdictions
who
are
equally
bound
by
the
fifth
amendment
cannot
team
up--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
correct,
strictly
speaking
it's
not,
but
the
court
in
malloy
v.
hogan
said,
we
are
going
to
apply
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
states
just
as
we
apply
it
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
once
the
court
has
made
the
decision
to
extend
the
right
in
question
to
the
states
through
the
fourteenth
amendment,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they're
coextensive,
and
the
fundamental
premise
of
the
murphy
decision
is
that
we
do
have
cooperative
federalism
in
this
country
when
it
comes
to
law
enforcement,
and
it
makes
very
little
sense
to
say
that
once
the
states
are
no
longer
free
to
compel
testimony
under
the
federal
constitution,
that
they
may
then
operate
together
and
achieve
results
that
they
couldn't
achieve--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
extension
of
the
privilege
to
foreign
prosecutions
would
seriously
interfere
with
domestic
investigations,
because
we
cannot
grant
immunity
from
a
fear
of
foreign
prosecutions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
has
not
been
considered
by
most
courts
an
adequate
answer
to
concerns
about
the
fifth
amendment.
the
fifth
amendment
is
not...
does
not
stand
as
a
guarantee
that
depends
on
whether
later
events
bear
it
out.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no,
there
may
well
be
a
realistic
threat
of
prosecution
because
a
foreign
country
may
issue
an
extradition
order
to
us,
so
we
then
have
the
discretion
to
say,
well,
we're
not
going
to
comply
with
the
terms
of
our
extradition
treaty,
but
we
then
have
to
answer
to
the
world
community
for
our
decision
not
to
do
that.
in
a
case
in
which,
for
example,
an
act
of
terrorism
occurs
abroad
that
involves
citizens
of
foreign
states,
we
may
apprehend
some
of
them,
bring
them
to
this
country,
learn
that
they
fear
domestic
prosecution,
and
issue
an
immunity
order
which
would
ordinarily
require
them
to
testify,
but
they
may
say
no,
i'm
sorry,
i'm
not
going
to
testify
because
i
still
fear
prosecution
abroad.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
there
are
a
number
of
practical
implementation
questions,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
as
you
raise.
in
the
jurisdictions
where
a
claim
like
this
could
be
raised,
courts
will
have
to
go
through,
as
they
did
in
this
case,
several
bodies
of
foreign
law
and
try
to
make
appraisal
of
the
realistic
ability
of
a
foreign
government
to
prosecute,
and
that
stands
quite
a
bit
in
contrast
to
the
domestic
regime
in
which,
once
the
privilege
is
raised,
it
stands
as
an
absolute,
except
that
the
government
has
immunity
power,
and
the
immunity
power
has
always
been
viewed
as
essentially
coextensive
with
the
reach
of
the
fifth
amendment.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
certainly
true,
but
the
way
that
the
test
is
applied
in
the
lower
courts
is
not
terribly
demanding.
normally,
if
a
witness
can
identify
a
body
of
law
under
which
he
contends
it's
conceivable
that
he
might
be
incriminated,
he's
not
required
to
go
much
further
than
that.
courts
don't
typically
take
in
camera
testimony
to
determine
whether
the
answers
would
really
be
incriminating,
and
they
don't
typically
ask
whether
the
state
or
government
prosecution
that
is
feared
is
really
likely
to
happen.
it's
generally
enough
simply
to
assert
that
there
is
testimony
that
would
incriminate
the
individual
and
to
identify
a
law
under
which
that
might
happen,
and
the
government's
next
step
is
ordinarily
immunity
if
it
wants
the
testimony.
but
immunity
orders
aren't
going
to
work
in
this
context,
because
we
rarely
are
going
to
be
able
to
guarantee
that
the
immunity
order
will
actually
be
coextensive
with
the
scope
of
the
privilege
and
prevent
the
use
of
the
testimony
overseas
and,
as
a
result,
we
may
well
be
in
situations
where
we're
investigating
serious
terrorist
activity,
or
interstate...
international
drug
trafficking,
money
laundering,
white
collar
crime,
and
we
are
helpless
to
attain
our
prosecutorial
objectives
because
an
immunity
order
simply
doesn't
work.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
long
as
the
government
has
a
law
that
it's
seeking
to
enforce
in
that
circumstance,
i
don't
see
any
reason
why
the
fifth
amendment
question
would
change.
now,
it
is
conceivable
that
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
the
united
states
were
somehow
completely
in
control
of
a
foreign
prosecution
so
that
some
foreign
government's
prosecution
were
really
nothing
but
a
sham,
a
cover
under
which
the
united
states
were
really
the
prosecuting
entity,
then
the
analysis
might
be
different.
this
court
had
suggested
that
there
might
be
an
exemption
to
the
traditional
dual
sovereignty
rule
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
which
allows
the
states
and
the
federal
government
each
to
prosecute.
if
in
a
particular
case
a
defendant
could
show
that
in
reality
the
state
prosecution
was
simply
a
cover
for
the
federal
government
to
take
over
and
do
it
as
a
tool,
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i...
no,
that
makes
no
difference,
because
the
ultimate
constitutional
question
is
whether
the
criminal
case
in
which
incrimination
is
feared
is
a
criminal
case
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
our
essential
position
is
that
no
foreign
criminal
case
fits
within
the
language
of
the
fifth
amendment,
construed
in
light
of
its
history
and
its
policies
and,
as
a
result,
it
simply
doesn't
matter
that
the
witness
may
say,
i
fear
incrimination
overseas
because
the
united
states
may
cooperate
with
a
foreign
government.
now,
again,
the
role
of
immunity
statutes
here,
in
our
view,
is
key,
because
there
has
never
been
a
time
in
this
country
in
which
a
claim
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege
could
not
be
met
by
the
government
seeking
to
get
the
testimony
through
granting
immunity,
but
if
this
rule
proposed
by
the
respondent
and
accepted
by
the
second
circuit
were
adopted,
it
would
mean
that
the
united
states
would
no
longer
be
able
to
obtain
needed
testimony
and
it
would
put
a
witness
who
feared
foreign
prosecution
in
a
better
position
than
a
witness
who
fears
domestic
prosecution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
constitution
would
have,
and
it
would
have
meant
that
immunity
statutes
would
be
permissible
if
a
legislature
wished
to
pass
them.
the
historical
fact
is
that,
as
the
fifth
amendment
right
developed
in
the
common
law
in
england,
simultaneously
it
was
recognized
that
testimony
could
be
compelled
if
immunity
was
granted
and,
in
the
colonies
in
this
country
which
adopted
precursors
of
the
fifth
amendment
privilege,
immunity
statutes
were
also
enacted.
now,
the
federal
government
didn't
get
into
the
business
of
enacting
immunity
statutes
until
about
1857,
but
i
think
that's
largely
explicable
by
the
very
small
role
of
the
federal
government
in
prosecuting
criminal
cases
in
the
early
years
of
this
nation.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
would
do
far
more--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--justice
breyer,
because
an
immunity
statute
in
this
country
grants
the
witness
freedom
from
having
his
words
used
against
him
or
the
fruits
of
those
words
used
against
him.
it
doesn't
foreclose
a
prosecution
altogether.
this
court
in
the
kastigar
decision
overruled
the
view
that
transactional
immunity
is
required.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
because
the
second
circuit's
suggestion
in
effect
would
grant
transactional
immunity.
not
only
would
the
witness
be
free
from
having
his
words
used
against
him,
he
would
be
free
from
any
prosecution
altogether,
because
if
the
theory
of
the
immunity
statute
that
the
second
circuit
posited
is
correct,
that
witness
can
never
be
sent
to
the
foreign
country
where
he
might
be
prosecuted,
and
that
grants
the
witness
something
far
more
than
he
would
have
in
the
united
states,
puts
him
in
a
much
better
position
than
a
similarly
situated
u.s.
witness
would
be,
and
thwarts
the
foreign
country's
interest
in
prosecuting
if
it
could
do
it
without
the
defendant's
words
at
all.
it
is
also
anomalous
because
the
second
circuit's
holding
would
grant
a
witness
greater
protection
than
he
might
have
in
the
country
to
which
he
ultimately
goes
if
he
faces
prosecution.
that
country
might
not
recognize
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
the
same
way
or
to
the
same
extent
as
this
country,
and
thus
we
have
the
anomaly
that
here
the
witness
says,
i
don't
want
my
words
to
be
used
against
me
because
i
fear
prosecution
in
a
foreign
country,
and
then
when
he
gets
there
that
foreign
country
says,
we'd
now
like
your
testimony.
there's
no
basis
for
using
the
fifth
amendment
to
internationalize
u.s.
self-incrimination
rules
when
foreign
countries
themselves
may
treat
the
same
issues
quite
differently.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
unless
the
court
has
any
questions,
the
government
waives
rebuttal.
