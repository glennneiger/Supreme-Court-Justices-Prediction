unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
in
the
arndstein
case
the
court
extended
the
privilege
outside
of
the
scope
of
a
criminal
trial,
didn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
before
you
proceed
further,
would
you
tell
me
why
18
u.s.c.
1001
isn't
in
this
picture?
it
did
involve
a
false
statement
to
the
united
states,
so
why
is
it
seemed
to
be
conceded
that
there
is
no
criminal
case
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
wait.
you
just
told
us
that
that
refers
to
the
case
in
which
he
is
asked
to
testify,
not
the
case
in
which
he
would
presumably
incriminate
himself,
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
i
don't
understand
how
you
read
the
phrase,
in
any
criminal
case.
no
person
shall
be
compelled
in
any
criminal
case
to
be
a
witness
against
himself.
where
is
the
compulsion?
is
the
compulsion
in
the
case
in
which
i
am
summoned--
unknown
speaker
--to
testify?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
the
implication
in
the
latter
part,
to
be
a
witness
against
himself,
and
a
witness
where
is
what
we're
debating.
unknown
speaker
but
that
goes
to
where
the
compulsion
is,
not
to
where
the
incrimination
is,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
was
before
the
murphy
decision.
unknown
speaker
and
why
shouldn't
it
be
that
the
concern
is
controlling
the
conduct
of
the
federal
actor,
whether
a
federal
agent,
a
police
officer...
if
the
amendment
is
directed
against
the
compulsion,
the
action
that
is
prohibited
is
compelling
the
testimony,
why
should
it
matter
where
the
criminal
case
is
instead
of
who
is
doing
the
compelling?
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
our
cases
which
would
allow
the
respondent
to
make
the
argument
that
there
is
an
additional
protection
in
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
clause
that
it
is
simply
degrading
or
destructive
of
the
dignity
of
the
person
to
be
required
to
answer
and
to
confess
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i'm
not
so
sure,
and
do
you
get
that
out
of
malloy
or
murphy?
where
do
you
get
this
interest
in
individual
dignity
or
autonomy?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
because
you
can
have
immunity.
unknown
speaker
which
leads
me
to
think
that
there
is
no
freestanding
interest
in
just
individual
dignity,
that
it's...
the
only
question
is
whether
or
not
it
can
be
used
by
the
government
which
is
going
to
prosecute
him.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
can
the
federal
government
compel
testimony
that
would
incriminate
someone
in
a
state
proceeding
by
giving
him
immunity
from
the
state
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
in
a
state
proceeding
as
well.
what
case--
--what
case
settles
that?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
is
it
possible
that
the
federal
government,
for
example
in
this
case
the
osi,
might
want
to
cooperate
with
a
foreign
nation
to
see
the
individual
prosecuted
elsewhere
and
have
a
motive
to--
unknown
speaker
--secure
the
testimony
to
help
the
foreign
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
well,
should
that
make
any
difference
in
our
concerns
about
this
case,
if
it's
that
kind
of
a
situation?
unknown
speaker
do
foreign
countries
scratch
our
backs,
too?
i
mean,
do
we
get
people
to
testify
before
the
courts
of
foreign
countries
that
don't
have
fifth
amendment
protections,
knowing
that
what
they
say
can
be
used
in
a
federal
criminal
prosecution?
unknown
speaker
after
the
testimony
is
already
taken.
unknown
speaker
after
the
cat
is
out
of
the
bag.
unknown
speaker
i
take
it,
then,
to
your
argument
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
foreign
country
is
a
country
that
has
a
comparable
privilege,
perhaps,
or
strata,
or
whether
it's
a
country
that's
typical
of
a
civil
law
system
that
would
not?
unknown
speaker
why
is
that?
that
is,
if...
i'm
thinking
only
of
the
fourteenth.
i
agree
with
you
that,
let's
say
hypothetically
the
fifth
is
federal.
they're
talking
about
a
federal
trial,
but
the
fourteenth
uses
the
word
liberty,
and
it
protects
a
person's
liberties.
so
if
there's
a
person
in
ohio
who
would
be
deprived
of
a
liberty
by
having
his
testimony
taken
and
used
in
an
ohio
proceeding,
it
would
deprive
that
person
of
a
liberty,
so
he
must
have
a
liberty
not
to
have
his
testimony
forced
from
him
for
ohio.
why
is
it
different
from
lithuania?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
fourteenth
amendment
doesn't
talk
about
what
ohio
can
do.
the
fourteenth
amendment
talks
about
the
liberty
that
a
person
enjoys.
unknown
speaker
where
does
it
say
that
in
the
constitution?
i
thought
all
that
it
says
in
the
constitution
is
that
you
cannot
deprive
a
person
of
a
liberty.
it
says
no
state
shall
deprive
a
person
of
a
liberty.
we're
talking
about
a
liberty.
what's
the
liberty?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
may
i
just
interrupt?
it
isn't
technically
and
strictly
correct
to
say
that
the
state
is
bound
by
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
it's
bound
by
the
fourteenth
amendment--
unknown
speaker
--which
has
a
liberty
protection
which
is
somewhat
comparable,
or
is
comparable
to
the
fifth.
unknown
speaker
but
strictly
speaking
the
state
is
not
bound
by
the
fifth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and
when
we
say
just
as
we
apply
it
to
the
federal
government,
there
is
no
case,
with
reference
to
the
fourth
amendment
search
rules,
the
fifth
amendment
self-incrimination
or
double
jeopardy
rules,
or
the
jury
trial
rules
in
which
the
state
protection
is
any
greater
or
any
less
than
is
granted
to...
under
the
federal...
than
is
applicable
to
the
federal
government,
is
that
not
correct?
unknown
speaker
they
are
coterminous
in
each
case.
unknown
speaker
can
i
ask
you
about
that,
because
i
was
just
testing
out
the
linguistic
argument,
that's
why
i
was...
justice
stevens
made
the
point
linguistically,
but
i
have
a
practical
question,
which
is
why...
how
specifically
would
extension
of
the
protection
that
you
oppose
interfere
with
government
law
enforcement
efforts?
in
particular,
i'm
thinking
that
it
must
be
perhaps
a
fairly
unusual
case
where,
say,
as
here,
the
statute
of
limitations
has
run,
5
years,
so
there's
no
risk
of
domestic
protection.
i'm
guessing
that
in
most
cases
anybody
who
can
assert
a
fifth
amendment
privilege
in
respect
to
a
foreign
country
probably
could
here,
too,
so
i'm
interested
in...
i'm
raising
that
so
you'll
respond
to
the
real
practicality,
how
would
extension
really
interfere
with
law
enforcement
efforts?
unknown
speaker
why
don't
you
just
say
to
the
person
you
wouldn't
deport
him?
unknown
speaker
but
doesn't
there
have
to
be
a
realistic
threat
of
prosecution,
and
if
you
say
you're
not
going
to
deport
him,
then
there's
no
realistic
threat.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
there
considerable
administrative
difficulty
in
applying
the
rule
sought
by
the
respondent
here?
courts
in
this
country
are
going
to
have
to
analyze
whether
the
fear
is
realistic
or
not
and
really
familiarize
themselves
with
a
number
of
different
kinds
of
foreign
law.
unknown
speaker
outside
of
a
witness
who
is
a
defendant
in
a
criminal
trial,
you
have
to
show
that
there
is
a
likelihood
of
incrimination
in
the
answer.
you
can't
just
say,
i
plead
the
fifth
amendment,
period,
and
automatically
get
off.
unknown
speaker
suppose
that
in
this
case
or
a
similar
case
there
were
three
grounds
for
deportation,
each
of
them
fairly
substantial,
so
that
you're
going...
you
know
you're
going
to
be
able
to
deport
this
man
anyway.
if
ground
number
1
were
lying
on
the
application,
could
the
government
say,
we
don't
really
need
your
testimony
because
we're
going
to
be
able
to
deport
you
anyway,
but
we
want
it
in
order
to
help
lithuania,
or
israel,
or
some
other
foreign
country?
would
that
be
a
legitimate
basis
for
the
government
to
compel
the
testimony?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
hypothetical
i
put
is
a
little
different.
it's
not
that
the
foreign
prosecution
is
a
cover,
but
that
the
united
states
is
very
eager
to
assist
the
foreign
prosecution.
that
makes
no
difference
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
constitution
would
have
had
the
same
meaning,
i
suppose,
if
the
congress
had
never
passed
any
immunity
statutes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
second
circuit's
suggestion
was
that
the
congress
could
pass
statutes
in
the
extradition
and
deportation
area
that
are
analogous
to
the
immunity
statutes
in
the
domestic
area.
it
could
thereby
do
just
what
the
immunity
statutes
have
done.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
i
mean,
why
couldn't
congress...
what's
wrong
with
the
second
circuit's
suggestion?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
berzins,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
berzins,
could
the
united
states
constitutionally
compel
your
client
to
do
something
which
would
be
criminal
under
the
law
of
another
country?
if
it
wanted
to,
could
the
united
states
pass
a
statute
that
says,
if
you
do
not
do
this
you
are
committing
a
crime
in
the
united
states
and
will
be
put
in
jail,
even
though,
under
the
law
of
another
country,
if
he
did
what
the
federal
statute
says,
he
would
be
subject
to
criminal
punishment?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
much
less
than
that,
it
seems
to
me.
here,
what
the
united
states
would
be
compelling
would
not
automatically
subject
him
to
criminal
punishment
somewhere
else.
it
would
just
allow
in
evidence
somewhere
else
that
might
subject
him
to
criminal
punishment.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
greater
includes
the
lesser.
it's
a
very
strange
system
in
which
we
say
we
can
compel
you
to
do
something
that
will
enable
a
foreign
country
to
send
you
to
jail,
but
we
cannot
compel
you
to
say
something
which
might
be
used
as
part
of
a
criminal
prosecution
in
a
foreign
country
that
might
send
you
to
jail.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
berzins,
you
know,
we're
bound
under
stare
decisis
by
the
holding
of
the
murphy
case.
we're
not
bound
to
just
accept
every
sentence
in
the
opinion.
unknown
speaker
no.
well--
--it
prohibits
compulsion
which
incriminates.
that's
the
other
half,
and
i
think
the
government...
you
have
to
agree,
don't
you...
maybe
you
don't.
don't
you
agree
that
the
government
is
correct
that
you're
asking,
really,
for
a
superprivilege,
because
the
government
is
powerless
to
grant
immunity
in
this
case,
and
we
know
of...
i
know
of
no
other
case
where
the
federal
government
is
powerless
to
give
an
immunity
when
we
have
simply
a
state
or
a
federal
prosecution
under
the
kastigar
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
a
u.s.
citizen
can't
ask
for
immunity
in
a
civil
action,
which
is
the
immunity
you're
suggesting
that
the
government
must
give
your
client.
unknown
speaker
you
recognize,
don't
you,
that
if
he
does
successfully
plead
self-incrimination,
that
could
be
used.
his
refusal
to
answer
could
be
used
against
him
in
the
deportation
proceeding,
so
his
risk
of
deportation
is
enhanced
if
he
refuses
to
testify,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
i
wanted...
your
client
is
now
85
years
old,
is
that...
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
he's
still
with
us.
unknown
speaker
well,
they're
not
proceeding
in
a
criminal
action
against
him
and
apparently
there's
no
prospect
of
that
in
the
united
states,
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
before
we
get
back
to
the
cruel
trilemma,
i
mean,
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
the...
as
i
understand
it
they
want
to
use
this
in
a
civil
proceeding
and
so
far
as
i
can
tell
from
anything
you
have
said
there
is
no
prospect
of
a
domestic
criminal
proceeding.
are
those
two
points
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it
makes--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
it
makes
no
difference.
i
don't
have
kastigar
in
front
of
me,
but
my
recollection
is
that
kastigar
explained
murphy
as
being
the
result
of
the
decision
in
malloy,
so
that
the
theory,
if
i
understand
the
kastigar
explanation,
was
in
effect
that
we
will
recognize
the
privilege
in
order,
in
effect,
to
guarantee
enforcement
of
fifth
amendment
rights
in
any
jurisdiction
in
which
fifth
amendment
rights
apply.
originally
they
just
applied
with
respect
to
federal
prosecutions.
after
malloy
they
apply
with
respect
to
state
prosecutions.
but
the
theory,
as
i
understand
it,
after
kastigar
remains
that
the
enforcement
was
geared
to
preserving
the
right
in
a
jurisdiction
in
which
the
fifth
amendment
applied
and,
if
that's
the
case,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
would
have
to
modify
the
theory
of
the
fifth
amendment
in
order
to
recognize
your
position.
am
i
wrong
in
my
reading
of
kastigar
and
in
inferring
the
theory
behind
it
that
i
just
stated?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right.
i'm
talking
about
kastigar's
explanation
of
murphy
in
light
of
malloy.
do
you
think
that
was
an
incorrect
explanation,
an
incorrect
reconciliation
of
our
cases,
where
we
had
gone
from
a
regime
in
which
the,
a
state...
use
in
a
state
prosecution
didn't
count,
to
a
regime
after
malloy
in
which
use
in
a
state
prosecution
did
count,
and
kastigar
explained
it.
do
you
think
that
the
explanation
was
correct?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
does,
i
guess,
we've
got
to
read
criminal
case
in
a
very
different
way
from
the
way
we
have
read
it
before.
it's
got
to
go...
a
criminal
case
has
gone
from
federal
criminal
case
to
state
criminal
case
and
on
your
theory
it's
got
to
go
a
step
further,
or
we
would
have
to
adopt
a
compulsion
theory,
but
that
seems
out
of
the
question,
because
we
routinely
compel
testimony
if,
in
fact,
the
immunity
can
be
granted.
so
it
seems
to
me
we've
got
to
come
up
with
a
brand-new
theory
of
what
a
criminal
case
is,
and
we're
going
to
have
to
reject
the
prior
explanation
in
order
for
the
case
to
come
out
your
way.
unknown
speaker
mr.
berzins,
if
the
testimony
were
taken
under
seal
would
you
have
any...
would
you
still
object?
unknown
speaker
but
once
your
client
is
overseas...
i
don't
know
what
the
lithuanian
legal
system
is,
but
most
systems
have
at
best
a
muted
self-incrimination
guarantee
compared
to
ours,
so
once
he's
over
there
the
likelihood
is
that
his
testimony
could
be
compelled,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
was
this
tried
as
an
issue
of
fact
in
the
district
court,
mr.
berzins?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
there
is
a
whole
litany
of
things,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
would
make
for
administrative
difficulties.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
fact
that
it
may
be
a
hard
row
for
the
claimant
to
hoe
doesn't
mean
that
that
fact
shouldn't
be
taken
into
consideration,
because
it's
also
going
to
be
something
that
the
district
court
probably
has
to
spend
a
fair
amount
of
time
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
makes
no
difference
i
suppose
he
can
just
refuse
to
answer,
and
then
he
can
spend
his
time
in
jail
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
calling
it
an
individual
liberty
doesn't
make
it
any...
doesn't
change
the
wording
of
the
fifth
amendment,
which
is
a
privilege
against
self-incrimination,
and
i
think...
you
know,
worldwide,
as
justice
ginsburg
has
suggested,
that
is
not
a
universal...
universally
valued
as
highly
as
it
is
in
this
country.
so
to
call
it
individual
liberty
i
think
is
perhaps
an
overstatement.
it's
something
that
is
in
our
constitution.
it's
a
guarantee
that
we
enforce
in
our
courts,
but
to
call
it
a
liberty
doesn't
change
what
the
constitution
says.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it's
a
liberty
that
he
has
while
he's
in
this
country.
if
as
justice
kennedy
suggested,
a
case
in
which
the
government
has
two
grounds
for
deportation,
one
that
doesn't
incriminate
him
and
one
that
does,
and
say
he's
silent
about
the
one
that
does
but
he
gets
deported
on
the
other
ground
and
he
gets
sent
to
lithuania,
and
if
lithuania
doesn't
recognize
this
liberty,
he
would
there
be
forced
to
testify
against
himself,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
hasn't
convicted
himself
out
of
his
own
mouth
in
our
courts
because
he
hasn't
violated
any
united
states
criminal
statute.
he
has
given
testimony
that
may
be
useful
abroad
in
a
country
that
does
not
provide
that
particular
liberty
protection
that
we
provide.
unknown
speaker
you
do
acknowledge
that
it
is
kind
of
a
superprivilege
that
he
would
have
because
of
the
absence
of
the
immunity,
the
absence
of
the
united
states'
ability
to
give...
to
immunize
the
testimony?
unknown
speaker
the
government
is
saying
that,
imagine
ordinary
drug
dealers
who
somehow
get
into
this
country
and
if,
in
fact,
it's
a
drug
dealer
from
new
york
who's
in
ohio,
and
ohio
wants
to
compel
the
testimony,
ohio
can
simply
give
use
immunity,
or...
and
it's
possible
that...
and
that
person
can't
be
prosecuted
for
what
flows
from
that
particular
testimony.
but
suppose
the
person,
instead
of
coming
from
new
york
to
ohio,
comes
from
some
foreign
country
to
ohio,
and
now
the
government
is
saying,
well,
we
don't
know
what
to
do.
i
mean,
we'll
never
be
able
to
get
this
testimony.
there's
no
way
to
deal
with
the
foreign
country.
the
best
we
could
ever
do
is
not
deport
him,
and
if
we
don't
deport
him,
that
means
he
can
never
be
prosecuted
there
for
anything,
though
he
might
have
been
the
worst
murderer
in
this
other
country
that
anybody's
ever
seen.
now,
what's
your
response?
is
there
a
response
to
that
claim
of
the
government?
unknown
speaker
why
will
they
be
few
and
far
between,
given,
let's
say,
current
international
criminal
behaviors
which,
you
know,
are
all
over
the
place?
why
won't
it
come
up
every
day
of
the
week?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
in
your
view
the
government
can
compel
your
client's
testimony
provided
it
says
what?
a)
we
won't
deport
him.
b)
we
will
deport
him
but
not
to
this
particular
country.
c)
we
will
get
a
promise
from
the
foreign
country
that
they
won't
use
the
testimony.
d)
we'll
get
a
promise
from
the
foreign
country
that
they
will
pardon
him.
any
of
those
four
would
be
sufficient,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
so
then
in
your
view
there
is
no
obstacle
of
a
practical
nature
for
the
government
to
getting
any
of
those
four
things,
or
is
there?
what
are
the
natures
of
the
obstacles?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you're
going
to
rely
on
it
being
a
miracle,
because
that
would
weaken
your
case
considerably.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
apparently
not,
mr.
berzins.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
