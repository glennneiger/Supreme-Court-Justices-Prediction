justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
isn't
it
true
that,
if
they
follow
the
definition
of
membership
that
the
d.c.
circuit
has
followed
in
the
case
justice
ginsburg
referred
to,
then
these
people
would
be
members?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
had
to
vote.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
organization--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
organization
is
not
a
party,
but
they
did
file
an
amicus
brief
in
which
they
do
challenge
the
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
no
matter
what
happens
we're
going
to
have
to
decide
standing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
it
true...
no
matter
what...
with
all
these
alternatives,
we're
going
to
have
to
decide
standing
anyway,
aren't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
don't
you
argue
standing?
yes.
you--
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
there
this
difference,
general
waxman...
and
maybe
i'm
wrong
on
this
and
i
just
don't
remember
it
that
well...
but
if
the
fec
decides
not
to
do
anything,
can't
the
litigants
then
proceed
independently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
plan
to
give
us
your
other
three
reasons?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we've
learned
the
first
two.
i'm
afraid
you
won't
get
to
the
others
if
you--
[laughter]
