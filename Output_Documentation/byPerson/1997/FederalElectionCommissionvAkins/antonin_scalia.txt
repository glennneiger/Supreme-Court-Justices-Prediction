justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
you--
--also,
they--
--wanted
us
to
reach
the
merits.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
said
that
we
should
reach
the
merits.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
but
what--
--or
even
information
in
particular.
why
don't--
--yes,
but
what's
different
here
is
that
there's
the
statute
that
says
you
are,
subject
to
certain
discretion
in
the
commission,
entitled
to
have
it.
that's
what
differentiates
them
just
from
the
mass
of
individuals
who
might
walk
into
a
court
and
say,
i
think
it
would
be
nice
if
i
were
to
know
the
following,
or
to
have
the
following
relief,
or
to
have
government
officials
do
what
they
ought
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
a
statutory
right
that
is
shared
by
everybody
in
the
country,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
everybody
can
follow
that
administrative
process.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
vindicate
the
right
to
the
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
everyone
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we've
decided
a
case
where
there
was
not
only
a
statutory
right
to
information
on
the
part
of
the
public
at
large,
but
a
constitutional
right
to
information
in
a
case
involving
the
statements
and
accounts
clause,
where
plaintiffs
came
in
here
and
said,
the
cia
is
not
publishing
its
precise
expenditures.
it's
all
buried
under
the
defense
department
or
other
agencies.
we
want
a
statement.
and
we
said,
no
standing.
why
is
that
any
different
from
your
case?
these
people
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
a
right
to
this...
a
statute
is
more
important
than
the
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it
was
wrong.
justice
antonin
scalia
no?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
foia
grants
it
to
particular
individuals.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
may
request...
you
may
request
information.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
statute
does
not
say
particular
individuals
may
come
to
private
organizations
and
request
the
information,
does
it?
