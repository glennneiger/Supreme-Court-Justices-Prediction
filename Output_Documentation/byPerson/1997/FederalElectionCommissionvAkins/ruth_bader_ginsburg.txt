justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--well,
in
that
case
i
thought
that
the...
i
thought
that
the
chamber
of
commerce
case
intervened
between
the
threejudge
panel
in
this
case
and
the
en
banc
in
this
case,
is
that
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
at
the
time
you
were
arguing
political
committee
at
the
en
banc,
the
d.c.
circuit
had
already
decided
the
membership
question
in
the
chamber
of
commerce
case,
and
to
me
it
was
just
a
total
mystery
how
come
these
two
never
met
from
the
same
court.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
wasn't
aipac
itself
always
taking
the
position
that
it
was
a
membership
organization
communicating
with
its
members?
i
mean,
it
was
not--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--it
was
not
in
this
litigation.
it
was--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
waxman,
just...
i
don't
understand.
first
you're
saying,
don't
reach
the
merits
because
there's
a
standing
hurdle,
but
if
you
should
find
there's
no
standing
hurdle,
skip
over
another
possible
hurdles...
this
is
my
concern.
this
question,
political
question,
is
not
easy,
and
it
could
be
a
really
important
thing
to
a
lot
of
organizations
that
just
have
mailing
lists,
that
don't
have
duespaying
members.
why
should
we
decide
that
question
in
a
case
where
it
may
well
be
that
this
particular
organization
qualifies
as
a
membership
organization,
so
the
question
is
really
academic
for
aipac?
why
shouldn't
we
hold
off
on
such
a
question
until
we're
sure
we
have
the
kind
of
entity
that
would
be
affected
by
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
send
it
back.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
waxman,
i
understand
your
anxiety
about
standing,
and
that
sounds
perfectly
sensible,
but
i...
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
you
don't
have
a
second
step
and
say,
if
you
should
decide
standing,
then
send
it
back
to
the
commission.
the
commission
doesn't
know
yet
what
its
membership
thing
is,
but
when
it
gets
its
act
together
this
case
may
well
be
moot
as
far
as
a
political
committee
is
concerned,
so
i
certainly
understand
why
you
want
to
urge
standing
first.
what
i
don't
understand
is
why
you're
not
telling
us,
but
if
we're
wrong
about
standing,
this
case
should
not
be...
the
ultimate
question
in
this
case
should
not
be
reached
because
it
might
fold
at
the
commission
level
on
what
justice
o'connor
said
at
the
very
first
is
a
threshold
question,
a
preliminary
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
i
understand,
but
what
i
don't
understand--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--is
the
political
committee--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--but
the
thing
would
be
vacated,
because
the...
just
as
we
would
not
reach
political
committee,
neither
should
the
d.c.
circuit,
so
i'm
still
puzzled
why
you
don't
say,
standing
is
our
first
argument,
but
if
we
lose
on
that,
vacate
the
district
court's...
the
d.c.
circuit's
decision,
send
it...
have
them
send
it
back
to
the
commission
so
the
membership
issue
can
be
determined.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
do
i
understand
the
reason
the
agency
didn't...
it
says,
this
membership
question
really
was
in
doubt.
the
agency
rejected
it
in
this
case
and
said
that's
why
we're
not
going
to
go
forward
with
any
enforcement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
schember,
can
we
just
go
back
a
step,
because--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there
are
many
cases,
are
there
not,
where
anyone
can
come
to
an
agency
and
say,
agency,
i
want
you
to
consider
this,
like,
i
want
you
to
make
a
rule
on
that,
and
the
agency
statute
is
broad
enough
to
say
yes,
we
have
to
take
petitions
from
anybody.
but
when
the
agency
says
no,
then
there's
an
effort
to
get
to
an
article
iii
court
that
does
have
constitutional
limitations
on
what
it
can
hear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
i
think
there's
a
whole
category
of
cases,
are
there
not,
where
you
have
a
right
to
go
to
the
agency,
but
you
don't
have
a
right
to
go
further.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
general
waxman
said
that
if
we
go
all
the
way
in
this
case
they
would
still
request
at
the
end
of
the
line
a
remand
on
that
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there's
nothing
like
that...
there's
nothing
like
that
in
this
record.
