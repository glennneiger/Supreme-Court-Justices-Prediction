mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
in
holding
that
the
american
israel
public
affairs
committee,
or
aipac,
was
a
political
committee
within
the
meaning
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act,
the
court
of
appeals
misinterpreted
this
court's
decisions,
and
it
did
so
in
a
case
it
should
not
have
reviewed
on
the
merits,
for
the
respondents
do
not
have
standing.
aipac
is
an
association
engaged
in
issue
advocacy
and
lobbying.
the
fec
investigated
a
complaint
filed
by
individuals
who
disagree
with
aipac's
policies,
and
the
fec
concluded
that
aipac
had,
quote,
likely
made
inkind
contributions
aggregating
over
1,000
in
a
calendar
year.
the
commission
then
considered
whether
aipac
was
thereby
a
political
committee
under
the
act,
in
which
case
it
would
be
required
to
disclose
all
receipts
and
disbursements
over
200
dollars,
whether
or
not
they
were
related
in
any
way
to
a
campaign,
and
it
would
be
limited
in
how
much
money
it
could
receive,
and
from
whom.
the
commission,
interpreting
the
statute
in
light
of
this
court's
decisions
in
buckley
and
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
concluded
that,
because
campaignrelated
activity
was
not
a
major
purpose
of
aipac,
its
incidental
campaign
spending
did
not
require
it
to
comply
with
the
act's
restrictions
on
political
committees.
in
concluding
that
the
fec
acted,
quote,
contrary
to
law,
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
two
ways.
let
me
just
say
a
few
words
about
the
merits
and
then
address
the
standing
issues.
in
massachusetts
citizens
for
life,
this
court
deemed
it,
quote,
undisputed
that
an
organization
making
nearly
10,000
in
campaignrelated
spending
was
not
a
political
committee
because
its
major
purpose
was
issue
advocacy,
not
election
activity.
in
so
holding,
this
court
relied
on
its
earlier
conclusion
in
buckley
that,
quote,
to
fulfill
the
purposes
of
the
feca,
the
term
political
committee
need
only
encompass
organizations
that
under...
that
are
under
the
control
of
a
candidate,
or
the
major
purpose
of
which
is
the
nomination
or
election
of
a
candidate.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'd
be
grateful,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
o'connor,
a
great
deal
has
happened
with
respect
to
the
membership
issue
and
the
law
relating
to
who
consti...
what...
who
is
or
is
not
a
member
since
the
fec
made
its
decision
in
this
case,
and
let
me--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
fec
has
recently
within
the
last
3
weeks
issued
a
proposed...
a
notice
of
proposed
regulation
in
which
it
has
set
out
for
public
notice
and
comment
an
alternative
set
of
definitions
of
membership,
and
what
constitutes
a
member,
and
under
one
of
the
alternative
definitions
that
the
fec
is
proposing,
the
aipac
members,
insofar
as
the
record
existed
in
this
case
at
the
time,
would
not
qualify
as
members,
but
as--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
no,
what...
i
guess
what
i...
what
i
meant
to
say
is,
the
fec
has
not
yet
settled
on
a
firm
definition
of
membership.
it
did
after
the
decision
in
this
case,
but
that
regulation
was
struck
down
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
a
case
that
it
decided
a
few
years
after
the
fec
made
a
decision
in
this
case.
in
response,
the
fec--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
correct,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i...
i
agree
that
it
is,
like
many
other
things
in
this
case,
somewhat
mysterious,
but
i
think
what
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
concluded,
and
i
think
correctly,
is
that
for
purposes
of
deciding
this
case,
the
fec's
determination
was
that
the
people
that
aipac
considered
members
were
not,
in
fact,
members,
and
that
the
fec
is
now
in
the
process
of
determining...
of
fixing
on
a
definition
of
membership
which
it
has
not
yet
done,
but
still
takes
the
position
that
membership
can
be
defined
in
a
way
to
exclude
all
people
who
pay
50
dollars
a
year
in
dues
to
aipac.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
oh--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--absolutely
aipac
took
that
position,
and
in
fact
the
joint...
the
general
counsel's
brief
and
report
that
are
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
devote
a
very
substantial
portion
of
time
addressing
aipac's
contention
that
these
papers...
these
people
were
just
its
members,
and
therefore
these
weren't
expenditures
or
contributions
in
any
regard.
the
commission
concluded
otherwise,
and
the
commission
is
now
propounding
a
rule
which,
if
adopted--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--would
permit
them
to
adhere
to
that
insofar
as
aipac
still
has
the
same
rules
with
respect
to
membership
as
it
did
at
the
time.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that
the...
my
problem
with
answering
the
question,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
d.c.
circuit
did
not
apply,
as
we
understand
it,
a
rule
with
respect
to
who
was
a
member.
the
d.c.
circuit
simply
struck
down
the
commission's
prior
rule,
which
required,
as
a
bright
line
test,
that
no
matter
how
many
dues
anybody
paid,
and
no
matter
how
affirmatively
they
tried
to
be
a
member--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
was
a
bright
line
requirement
that
you
had
to
be
able
to
vote
for
at
least
one
member
of
the
governing
body.
that
was,
in
many
ways,
the
ratio
decidendi
of
the
commission
in
this
particular
case,
and
that
was
struck
down.
but
in
chamber
of
commerce,
the
d.c.
circuit
left
open
the
possibility
that
an
organization
like
aipac,
which
requires
only
50
dollars
to
establish
oneself
as
a
member,
might
properly
be
deemed
to
be
not
a
member
by
the
fec,
and
in
fact
in
the
petition
for...
in
its...
in
its
opinion
denying
rehearing
in
chamber
of
commerce
the
court
of
appeals
emphasized
that
it
is
open,
still
open
to
the
commission
to
define
membership
in
a
way...
i
mean,
it
wasn't
addressing
this
particular
case,
but
to
define
membership
in
a
way
that
would
or
wouldn't
include
aipac
members.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
particularly
tricky
here
is
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think
you
can
and
should
reach
the
merits.
no
one
in
this
case,
even
aipac
in
response
to
the
disposition
at
the
administrative
level,
has
challenged
the
membership
issue.
it's
not
been
briefed
anywhere.
it's
a
factsensitive
question,
and
it
may
very
well
be
true,
justice
o'connor,
that
if
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
sustained,
or
you
otherwise
dispose
of
this
case
in
a
way
in
which
the
commission
will
have
to
reevaluate
it,
that
antecedent
question
will
have
to
be
litigated
again.
but
right
now,
it
seems
to
me
the
law
of
the
case,
as
it
comes
up,
and
it's
not
a
question
presented--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--is
that
aipac...
these
people
were
members.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they...
well,
they
file
an
amicus
brief
in
which
they
say
they're
not
members--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
any
sense
in
which
the
federal
election
campaign
act
could
constitutionally
be
interpreted.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
think
that
this...
we
think
that
this,
that
the
lower
courts
should
not
have
reached
the
merits
of
this
case
because
these
respondents
don't
have
either
article
iii
or
statutory
standing,
but
if
you
do
reach
the
merits,
we
think
that
the
commission's
interpretation
of
this
court's
opinions
in
buckley
and
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
is,
quote,
sufficiently
reasonable
to...
to
uphold
it.
the
one
thing
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
is,
of
course,
open
to
this
court
either,
a)
to
address
the
membership
issue,
and
announce
a
determination
as
to
who...
whether
these
people
were
or
weren't
members
based
on
the
administrative
record,
or
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--hold
that
there
was
not...
vacate
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
send
it
back.
what
is
intolerable--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
membership
issue
certainly
is
not
one
that
has
come
to
you.
what--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
do
acknowledge
that
there
is
some
appeal
to
that
approach,
but
i
would
just
ask
the
court
to
look
at
this
from
the
perspective
of
the
commission.
the
commission
is
now
in
the
position
of
having
been
told
by
the
en
banc
court
of
appeals
that
virtually
any
voter
in
the
country
can
haul
it
into
court
whenever
it
makes
a
determination
that
a
group,
whether
it's
a
civic
or
religious,
or
my
family,
or
any
other
group
has
made
more
than
1,000
dollars
in
political
spending,
and
therefore
is
required
to
file
with
the
courts
as
a
political
committee,
and...
so
in
other
words,
that...
virtually
any
voter
can
bring
the
fec
into
court,
because
that's
the
standing
rule
they've
applied,
and
that
this...
that
the
commission's
efforts
to
apply
the
major
purpose
test
that
this
court
enunciated
is
wrong,
and
in
fact
any
group,
incorporated
or
otherwise,
that
makes
more
than
1,000
dollars
of
what
the
commission
would
deem
to
be
inkind,
coordinated
or
independent
expenditures
is
a
political--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we're
in
an
impossible
position.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
absolutely
right.
it
is
a
question...
for
purposes
of
the
law
of
the
case,
there
has
been
a
determination
by
the
commission
in
this
case
that
aipac's,
the
people
that
aipac
was
communicating
with
were
not
members.
if
we
are
wrong
and,
in
fact,
the
major
purpose
test
doesn't
apply,
on
remand
the
fec
will
have
to
consider
and
take
aipac's
views
whether
or
not,
in
light
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
in
chamber
of
commerce
aipac's
members
are,
in
fact
members
under
the
act.
it
is
a
very
tricky--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
guess
the
reason
is
that
if
you
hold...
if
you
conclude
that
there's
no
standing
in
this
case,
the
decision
in
the
court
below
is
vacated
and,
in
fact,
the
commission
is
back
on
its
own.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
if
you
don't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
you
don't,
we
are
left
with
a
decision
on
the
merits
of
a
critically
important
issue
of
law,
which
is,
are
groups
that
are
organized
for
any
number
of
hundreds
of
different
reasons
political
committees?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
fec
is
in
an
extremely
unusual
posture
in
this
case
visavis
the
substantive
law
of
the
federal
election
commission
act,
mainly
because
in
this
dance
with
congress
and
the
supreme
court
the
fec
is
very
much
following...
we're...
the
commission
is
trying
very
hard
to
determine--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
extent
to
which
groups
are
political...
excuse
me?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
you
certainly
are
going
to
have
to
decide
standing.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
why
don't
i
argue
standing.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
think...
we
believe
that
the
court
erred
in
holding
that
respondents
held
standing
in
this
case,
either
under
the
statute
or
the
constitution,
to
challenge
the
commission's
decision.
in
cases
like
heckler
v.
chaney
and
linda
r.
s.
v.
richard
d.,
this
court
has
reiterated
a
fundamental
background
principle
that
ordinarily
complaints
that
an
agency
has
failed
to
take
enforcement
action
are
not
subject
to
judicial
review,
but
under
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation,
as
i
said,
it's
now
open
to
almost
any
voter
to
bring
the
fec
into
court
whenever
it
decides
not
to
file
an
enforcement
action
against
a
religious,
civic,
issue
advocacy,
or
any
other
group
that
may
have
made
incidental
election
expenditures.
we
believe
that
congress
did
not
intend
that
result,
but
even
if
it
did,
for
article
iii
purposes
we
believe
that
respondents
have
not
carried
their
heavy
burden
to
establish
either
that
they
have
suffered
particularized
concrete
injury
in
fact,
or
that
they
will
likely
obtain
the
single
remedy
that
they
allege
will
redress
them.
that
is,
a
retrospective
order
of
disclosure,
and
nothing
else.
the
fec...
and
this
is...
i
think
the
court
of
appeals
erred
in
assuming
to
the
contrary.
unlike
most
other
agencies
the
fec
has
no
authority,
no
matter
what
the
court
of
appeals
or
this
courts
decide,
to
order
aipac
to
produce
anything.
in
fact,
congress'
preferred
remedy
for
a
violation
of
the
act,
a
conciliation
agreement,
certainly
need
not
require
this
disclosure
and
is
exempt
from
judicial
review.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
other
words,
if
the
fec
decides
not
to
do
anything,
could
the
respondents
sue
aipac?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
absolutely
not.
under
437g(a)(8),
which
is
the
judicial
review
provision
that's
at
issue
in
this
case,
a
third
party...
there
is
no
third
party
right
of
action.
there
is
no
private
attorneys
general
provision
here
similar
to
what
there
is
in
so
many
other
cases.
here,
what
happens
is,
the
act
provides
that
any
person
can
make
a
complaint
with
the
commission
alleging
that
the
feca
has
been
violated.
if
the
commission
dismisses
the
complaint,
and
now
i'm
referring
to
the
judicial
review
provision
here,
a
party
aggrieved
by
an
order
of
the
commission
dismissing
a
complaint
may
file
a
petition
against
the
commission
in
the
district
of
columbia,
and
under
subsection
(c)
of
that
provision,
in
the
event
that
such
a
complaint
is
filed,
the
authority
of
the
federal
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
is
simply
to
declare
whether
or
not
the
fec
has,
quote,
conformed,
acted
in
conformity
with
the
law,
or
contrary
to
the
law.
if
the
court
concludes
that
the
fec
has
acted
contrary
to
the
law,
the
case
goes
back
to
the
fec
to
allow
the
commission
to
conform
itself
to
the
law.
only
if
it
fails
to
do
that
may
an
individual
bring
a
cause
of
action
against
the
party
that
he
or
it
alleges
was
violating
the
act.
this
is
a
very,
very
unusual
and
limited
review
provision
that
reflects,
we
think,
congress'
recognition
of
the
fact
that
while
it's
important
to
regulate,
for
the
benefit
of
the
public,
campaign
expenditures,
campaign
spending,
and
disclosures,
there
are
very,
very
first...
important
first
amendment--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--these
plaintiffs
filed
an
administrative
complaint
with
the
commission
under
437g(a)(1),
and
when
the
commission
voted,
6
to
nothing,
not
to
proceed
further
on
their
complaint
that
the...
that
aipac
should
be
required
to
file
these
reports
and
register
as
a
political
committee,
they
brought
a
suit
in
the
district
court
against
the
federal
election
commission
under
these
provisions.
and
i
think...
one
of
the
things
that
demonstrates
why
there
is
so
little
standing
in
this
case
is
reflected
by
the
fact
that
in
their
original
complaint,
filed
in
the
district
court,
these
respondents
alleged,
among
other
things,
that
they
were
voters,
and
that
they
had
been
injured
in
the
fact
that
they
had
been
deprived
of
certain
information
they
might
have
wanted
to
have
as
voters.
their
amended
complaint
deleted
that
allegation,
and
alleges
standing
on
the
grounds
that
they
are
political
competitors
in
the
court
of
public
opinion.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
a
point
here--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
think
there
are...
i
think
there
are
cases
that...
there
are
cases
going
both
ways.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
the
question
here
is,
we
think
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
construe
this
review
provision
as
extending
prudential
standing
to
the
limits
of
article
iii,
as
in
trafficante
and
hardin
and
cases
like
that,
there
still
would
be
no
constitutional
standing
here
because
they
haven't
demonstrated
injury
in
fact.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
not
injury
in
fact
if
we're
talking
about
them
in
their
capacity
as
voters
who,
after
all,
are...
the
electorate
is
certainly
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
disclosure
provisions
of
the
federal
election
campaign
act.
they
have
not
made
any
allegations
that
they
are
any
different
than
any
other
voters
who
allegedly
want
this
information--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--of
course.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
it...
it
certainly
does
not
always
show
they
don't
have
standing,
but
i
think
it's
instructive
to
compare
this
statute
or
their
claim
of
standing
here
with
a
claim
of
standing
under
the
foia,
for
example.
foia
provides
a
personal
right
in
an
individual
to
ask
the
government,
to
have
that
individual
ask
the
government
for
information,
and
if
the
government
doesn't
provide
that
person
information,
that
person
is
injured
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
and
can
bring
a
lawsuit,
and
there's
no
issue
of
redressability,
because
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
individual
he
gets
the
document
that
exists.
the
federal
election
campaign
act
doesn't
create
rights
in
particular
individuals
to
get
particular
information.
it
creates
an
obligation
on
certain
persons
and
parties
that
are
regulated
by
the
act
to
provide
kinds
of
information
to
the
government
which
the
government
then
makes
available
to
the
public
generally,
so--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--because
i
don't
think...
and
we
do
think
that
the
stronger
argument,
the
clearer
argument
against
article
iii
standing
is
redressability
both
because
of
the
discretionary
nature
of
the
decision,
the
particular
aft
powers
and
lack
thereof
of
the
commission,
and
particular
facts
in
this
case,
but
with
respect
to
article
iii
injury
in
fact,
these...
even
the
court
below
acknowledged
that
there
would
not
be
sufficient
particularized
injury
in
all
voters.
the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
these
were,
quote,
affected
voters,
but
its
definition
of
the
term
affected
was,
because
they
are
alleging
that...
assuming
that
they
are,
in
fact,
suing
as
voters,
that
aipac
may
have
participated
in
an
election
that
they
may
have
voted
in
they
might
have
been
deprived
of
information
that
they
could
have
used,
therefore,
they...
these
individuals--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
they...
i
think
another
way
to
put
it,
justice
souter,
is
that
these
individuals
are
not
asking
the
commission
to
do
something
because
they
were
harmed.
they're
asking
the
commission
to
do
something
so
that
they
can
determine
if
they
have
been
harmed.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
souter,
there
are
many,
many
decisions
of
this
court
under
article
iii
that
have
indicated
that
just
because
an
individual
plaintiff
has
an
interest
in
having
the
government
do
something
and
can
demonstrate
why
they
have
that
interest,
nonetheless
that
has
been
held
not
to
satisfy
the
particular--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
i
think
if
the
statute
had
been
written--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't...
we
may
just
disagree
about
the
statute.
this
statute,
unlike
foia,
does
not,
we
understand,
give
individuals
any
particular
right
to
obtain
any
particular
information,
particularly
information
that
the
commission
doesn't
have,
in
light
of,
as
i
said,
the...
a
general
background
principle
that's
reflected
in
linda
r.
s.
and
lots
of
other
cases.
this...
we're
talking
about
who
has
standing
to
haul
an
agency
into
court
and
demand
that
the
agency
go
and
get
information
from
particular
individuals,
even
if
the
agency
otherwise
might
conclude
that
they
should...
they
are
a
political
committee
and
they
probably
ought
to
report,
but
it
just
chooses
not
to
exercise
its
prosecutorial
discretion
that
way,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right.
that's
what
makes
this
case
particularly
nonredressable.
that
is,
there
were
two
related
questions
before
the
commission,
both
having
to
do
with
the
allegation,
and
the
commission's
conclusion
that
there
were,
in
fact,
expenditures,
inkind,
coordinated
expenditures
over
1,000
dollars.
there
were
two
possible
legal
conclusions
that
the
commission
could
reach.
one
is,
aipac
is
a
corporation,
and
corporations
can't
make
expenditures,
and
therefore
aipac
has
violated
441b.
the
commission
voted
4
to
2
to
conclude
that
they
had,
but
decided
not
to
proceed
with
any
sanction
at
all,
even
a
civil
fine,
because
a)
the
law
was
so
unclear,
and
b)
it
was
a
very
close
question
on
the
facts,
and
those
two--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i
understand--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
haven't
gotten
anywhere
near
as
far
as
we'd
like
to
be
at
the
end
of
this
argument.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
i
may
just
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i'm
hoping
against
hope
i
have
more
than
1
minute,
but
let
me
just
say
that
the
consequences
of
allowing...
on
the
merits
of
allowing
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
to
stand
is
that
every
group
in
this
country,
including
my
family,
and
any
association,
whether
it's
incorporated
or
not,
is
now...
has
to
live
under
the
very
real
chill
of
knowing
that
if
they...
in
the
course
of
a
year,
a
group
like
the
catholic
conference
of
the
united
states,
in
the
course
of
a
year,
makes
more
than
a
thousand
dollars
in
either
contributions,
independent
expenditures,
coordinated
expenditures,
or
inkind
contributions,
all
of
its
other
disbursements
and
receipts
have
to
be
disclosed
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--only
corporations
can
set
up
segregated
funds,
so
it...
but
for
the
fact
that
aipac
happens
to
be
incorporated
it
could
not,
but
even
if
it
could,
that
really
doesn't
get
at
the
chilling
effect
that
i
think
this
court
was
addressing
in
buckley
and
massachusetts
citizens
for
life.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
