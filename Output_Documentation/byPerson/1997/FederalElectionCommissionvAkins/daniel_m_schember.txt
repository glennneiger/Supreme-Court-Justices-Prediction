mr.
daniel
m.
schember
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
first
of
all,
our
amended
complaint
certainly
pleaded
information
standing
and
information
injury.
joint
appendix
11,
paragraph
6,
the
fec's
improper
action
has
deprived
plaintiffs
of
their
legal
right
to
learn
the
amounts
and
beneficiaries
of
aipac's
unreported
campaign
expenditures
in
their
capacity
as
voters
and
members
of
the
public.
the
only
difference
between
standing
in
this
case
and
standing
in
a
foia
case
concerns
the
issue
of
redressability.
we
certainly
have
a...
within
the
zone
of
interests
of
this
statute
an
interest
as
voters
and
members
of
the
public
in
obtaining
information
concerning
campaign
contributions.
the
government
admits
in
is
reply
brief
that
voters
and,
we
would
add,
members
of
the
public,
are
primary
intended
beneficiaries
of
this--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
linda
r.
s.
certainly
is
a
standing
case.
now,
heckler
v.
chaney,
that's
an
apa
reviewability
case,
but
linda
r.
s.
concerns--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--what
happened
there,
of
course,
the
interest
at
stake
was
one
spouse's
or
exspouse's
interest
in
child
support,
and
what
the
spouse
wanted
to
have
happen,
or
the
exspouse,
is
have
the
government
take
some
sort
of
criminal
action
against
the
father,
i
guess,
that
was
obliged
to
make
child
support
payments,
and
hopefully
the
coercive
power
of
the
prosecution
would
somehow
result
in
the
payment
of
child
support.
the
court
said,
that's
speculative.
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
that
issue
was
involved
with
that
case,
too,
but
here,
under
the
statutory
scheme,
we
have
a
right
to
go
to
court.
when
our
complaint
is
dismissed
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
we
have
a
stat...
no,
no.
you
have
to
file
an
administrative
claim.
not
everyone
in
the
country
can
simply
go
to
court.
you
have
to
go
through
the
administrative
process.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
but
only
if
they--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
because
we
have
a
statute.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
if
the
court...
i'm
not
familiar
with
that
case,
but
if
that
case
held
that
a
constitutional
right
to
information
is
a
generalized
grievance,
then--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--no.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
then
that
is
to...
then
how...
then
to
reconcile
that
holding
with
cases
saying
that
freedom
of
information
act
requestors
have
standing
to
seek
information
under
the
act
is
accomplished
by
saying
we
have
a
statute
that
grants
a
right
of
review
for
that
injury
in
fact,
and
we
have
a
statute
here
that
grants
a
right
to
judicial
review.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
those
who--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--that's
right.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
no.
it
says
something
different.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
the
only
difference,
though,
goes
to
the
question
of
redressability.
what
the
statute
says
is
that
the
plaintiffs
may
file
an
administrative
complaint
seeking
disclosure,
and
if
that
complaint
is
dismissed,
they
may
go
to
court
and
say
that's
contrary
to
law,
just
what
the
respondents
did,
and
then
the
question
is,
well,
if
there
is
a
favorable
ruling
on
the
merits
for
the
respondents,
is
it
likely...
bennett
v.
spear...
that
the
ruling
on
the
merits
will,
in
fact,
result
in
the
disclosure
that
they
seek.
that
is
the
case
here,
for
five
reasons
that
are
very
different
from
the
circumstances
in
linda
r.
s.
number
1,
a
favorable
ruling
on
the
merits
for
the
respondents
would
result
in...
would
essentially
mean
that
aipac
is
under
a
statutory
duty
to
disclose
the
information
that
the
respondents
seek.
second,
the
commission
has
power
to
order
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--i'm
not
saying
no
discretion.
that's
not
our
burden.
all
we
need
show
to
establish
redressability
is
that
it
is
likely
that
enforcement
action
would
be
taken
that
is
likely
to
result
in
the
producing
of
that
information,
and
for
four
additional
reasons
that
is
the
case
here.
the
second
reason
is
that
under
the
statute,
437d(a),
the
commission
does
have
power
to
order
aipac
to
disclose
this
information.
437d(a)
states
the
commission
has
the
power
to
require
any
person
to
submit
such
written
reports
and
answers
to
questions
as
the
commission
may
prescribe.
now--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--mmhmm.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
mmhmm.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
absolutely
correct,
but
we
do
have
the
right
here,
because
we
have
injury
in
fact.
we
have...
that
falls
within
the
zone
of
interests
of
the
statute.
voters
and
members
of
the
public
are
primary
intended
beneficiaries
of
the
disclosure
provisions
of
this
act.
that
is
undisputed.
they
have
a
right
to
make
an
administrative
request
seeking
disclosure,
and
if
their
complaint
is
dismissed,
go
to
court,
as
they
did,
and
it
is
likely
to
result
in
disclosure
in
this
case
for
the
two
reasons
that
i've
said
so
far,
and
for
a
third
reason,
that
when--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--the
answer
is
no.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
because
then...
yes,
if
you...
if
the
membership--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
but
we
have
standing
to
contest
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
the
aipac
contributors
are
members,
and
we
most
vigorously
maintain
that
they
are
not.
the
ruling
below
on
that
question
was
correct.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
but
under
the...
yes,
but
under
the
law
of
this
case
the
ruling
that's
been
made,
the
aipac
contributors
were
found
not
to
be
members,
and
we
would
maintain
that
chamber
of
commerce
does
not
require
a
change
in
that
conclusion.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
well,
of
course
shifting
off
of
standing
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
what's
appropriate
to
do--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
it's
another
legal
issue
in
the
case.
we
maintain
as
a
matter
of
law
on
the
facts
present
in
this
case
that,
under
chamber
of
commerce
or
the
prior
authority,
that
the
aipac
contributors
are
not
members.
we
also
maintain,
on
the
record
of
this
case,
that
there
is
additional
indication
of
contributions
by
aipac
going
beyond
merely
communication
to
the
persons
that
these...
that
aipac
calls
its
members.
we
maintain
that
what
happens
after
aipac
makes
these
communications
to
its
contributors,
that
these
contributors
then
not
only
go
out
in
their
individual
capacities
to
make
campaign
contributions
involving
themselves
in
campaigns,
but
that
they
then
report
back
to
aipac
that
they
have
done
so.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
oh,
yes,
there
is,
your
honor.
there
was
evidence
submitted
to
that.
no
findings
by
the
fec
on
that
question.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
but
that's
another
issue
to
be
addressed
on
remand.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
i
haven't
seen
the
proposed
rules.
i'm
relying
on
general
waxman's--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--i
haven't
seem
them
if
they
are,
but
i'm
not
saying
they're
not.
i'm
just
saying
i'm
ignorant.
i'm
relying
on
general
waxman's
representation.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
that's
far
from
established
on
the
record.
no.
they
contribute
50
dollars.
the
precise...
aipac,
from
the
record
that
we
have,
which
is
not
complete
on
this
question,
is
a
topdown
organization.
power
vests...
is
at
the
top,
and
the
50
dollar
contributor
does
not
have
much
right
to
determine
a
policy
of
that...
of
the
organization.
that's
what
the
record
shows
so
far,
and
based
upon
that,
and
if
we
have
to
litigate
it
further,
yes,
we
have
to
litigate
it
further,
but
we
staunchly
maintain
that
these
contributors
are
not
members,
but
even
if
they
were,
there
would
be
another
basis
for
finding,
upon
further
investigation,
that
aipac
is
engaged
in
political
campaign
contributions
of
a
different
sort,
which
i
just
mentioned.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes.
i--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--it--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
i
certainly
would
say
that
a
plaintiff
cannot
be
denied
standing
on...
to
sue
under
a
law
on
the
assumption,
well,
there
might
be
a
change
of
the
law
in
the
future.
one
has...
that
kind
of
speculation
doesn't
defeat
redressability.
all
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
whether
the
membership
question
was
decided
correctly
by
the
fec
or
not
is
not
pertinent
to
standing.
it
would
only
be
pertinent
to
standing
if
chamber
of
commerce
decided
the
issue,
and
we
had
no...
we
had
no
ability
to
contend
that
aipac's
contributors
are
not
members.
certainly
then,
if
we
had
no
hope
of
being
able
to
maintain
our
claim
that
those
contributors
aren't
members,
then
perhaps
that
would
be
linked
to
standing.
we
would
have
no
possibility
of
redress,
that
would
be
true.
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
we
maintain,
notwithstanding
chamber
of
commerce,
that
aipac's
contributors
are
not
members,
and
they
are
not...
and
that
these
communications
are
campaign
contributions.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
well,
the...
to
review,
we've
had
the
first...
the
first
one
is,
determine
a
favorable--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--the
commission
has...
when
the
commission
finds
a
violation
it
is
under
a
mandatory
legal
duty
under
section
437g(4)(a)
to
attempt
to
correct
such
violation.
now,
the
likely
way
to
correct
a
disclosure
violation,
by
which
i
mean
a
failure
to
disclose
information
that
should
be
disclosed,
particularly
where
the
information
to
be
disclosed
is
readily
available,
is
to
demand
that
the
information
be
disclosed.
certainly,
to
maintain
that
it
is
not
even
likely
that
a
good
faith
attempt
to
in...
to
correct
a
disclosure
violation
will
not
in
any
way
involve
a
demand
for
disclosure
of
readily
available
information
is
absurd.
it
is
likely
that
a
good
faith
enforcement
of
this
statute
under
this
provision
to
correct
a
disclosure
violation
will
result
in
disclosure
where
the
information
is
readily
available.
point
4,
the
record
here
shows
that
the
information
sought
by
the
respondents
includes
types
of
information
that
is
readily
available.
what
we're
seeking
essentially
is,
to
which
candidates
did
aipac
contribute,
and
since
the
manner
of
contribution
was
inkind,
essentially
having
the
paid
staff
of
aipac
drum
up
support
in
the
field
for
those
candidates,
how
much
time
did
the
aipac
staffers
devote
to
those
particular
campaigns.
how
much
effort
did
they
put
into
it?
this
kind
of
information
doesn't
require
elaborate
reconstruction
of
records
and
broad
disclosure
this
is
simple
information
that
is
the
core
information
that
we're
entitled
to
get
and
that
we
want
to
know.
we
want
to
know
this
simple
type
of
information.
aipac
cannot
plausibly
claim
that
it
doesn't
know
who
its
paid
staffers
were
who
engaged
in
these
activities.
the
paid
staffers
can't
plausibly
claim
that
they
can't
remember
what
candidates
they
supported,
or
what
they
did.
this
is
readily
available
information
that
can
be
disclosed.
the
last
point
is
that,
on
the
record
before
the
court,
when
the
fec,
during
the
investigation
of
this
case,
asked
aipac
for
information,
there
wasn't
recalcitrance
and
nondisclosure
by
aipac.
aipac
complied
with
the
fec's
requests
for
information.
what
we
have
in
the
totality
of
circumstances,
the
record
here
and
this
legal
framework,
which
gives
the
commission
power
to
order
disclosure,
a
likelihood
that
disclosure
will
result
if
aipac
is
found
to
be
a
political
committee
because
the
major
purpose
test
is
invalid.
now,
when
we
get
to
the
merits,
we
face
a
fundamental
question
which
justice
ginsburg
has
been
pressing
what
question
should
be
decided
first,
the
membership
question,
or
the
major...
or
whether...
or
the
validity
of
the
major
purpose
test.
i
suppose...
we
put
a
lot
of
energy
into
briefing
the
major
purpose
test,
and
we're
convinced
that
it's
wrong,
and
then
the
court...
and
we
would
like
the
court
to
decide
that
question,
but
if
the
court
is
troubled
by
the
question
and
thinks
the
d.c.
circuit
should
not
have
reached
it,
it
would
be
a
permissible
disposition
of
this
case
to
say
that
the
membership
question
ought
to
be
addressed
first.
i
can't
raise
an
argument
against
that.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
is
correct?
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
i
don't...
the
bottom
line
argument
they
say
that
i
find
in
their
reply
brief
as
well,
that's
what
the
dicta
in
buckley
said.
the
court
of
appeals
properly
held
that
this
dicta
in
buckley
literally
construed
and
applied
in
the
way
that
the
fec
has
applied
it
here...
for
the
first
time,
i
might
add.
this
is
the
first
time
that
the
fec
has
applied
the
major
purpose
test
in
this
way...
is
contrary
to
law
because
it
would
eviscerate
the
statute.
it
simply
makes
no
sense
to
exempt
from
political
committee
status
an
organization
that
makes
a
million
dollars
in
campaign
contributions
simply
because
they're
rich
and
have
got
9
million
dollars
to
spend
on
something
else.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that's
a
very
difficult
question.
i
think
general
waxman
would
say
no
under
437d(e),
which
says
that
this
section
shall
be
the
exclusive
civil
remedy
for
enforcement.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
but
we
would
say
under
heckler
that
we
would...
if
heckler
applied,
if
the
apa
applied,
that
there
would
not
be
total
denial
of
judicial
review
here.
there
is
law
to
apply.
under
437g(4)(a)
a
conciliation
agreement
by
the
fec
must
be
one
that
corrects
the
violation.
that's
law
to
apply,
and
if
they...
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
determined,
if
the
fec's
gave
mere
lip
service
to
aipac's
disclosure
obligation
and
dismissed
our
complaint
saying,
well,
we
agree
with
aipac
that
they
don't
have
to
do
it,
we
have
a
right
of
judicial
review,
and
there
is
law
to
apply.
this
statutory
framework
contemplates
active
judicial
involvement
in
the
determination
of
appropriate
remedies
for
violations.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
this--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--no.
i
think
the
standing
question
could
be
pretermitted
as
well--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--i
suppose
that
would
be
permissible.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
we
certainly
have
standing
to
contend
that
the
aipac
contributors
aren't
members,
and
that...
in
that
sense
i
don't
think
it...
that
issue
pertains
to
standing.
what
i
did
concede
is
that
if
chamber
of
commerce
destroyed
our
contention
that
the
aipac
contributors
are
members,
that
certainly
might
say
that
we
don't
have
standing,
but
it
remains
an
open
question.
it's
just
another
legal
issue
in...
to
be
decided
in
the
case,
and
so
i
guess
i'm
moving
a
bit
in
your
favor
on...
in
the
direction
that
you're
going
on
that,
your
honor,
because
we
have
a
collection
of
legal
issues
that
need
to
be
decided,
the
membership
question,
the
major
purpose
test
question,
and
in
the
way
that's
been
discussed
possibly
that's
linked
to
standing.
presum...
yes,
remand
for
consideration
of
the
issues
in
a
different
order
i
would
think
would
be
a
permissible
disposition.
we
have
raised
the
arguments
as
to
why
we
have
standing
to
bring
this
case
and
why
it's
likely
that
a
ruling
on
the
merits
will
result
in
the
disclosure
that
we
seek,
and--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--no,
your
honor.
what
we're
dealing
with
is
a
dual
purpose
organization.
the
test
is
not
necessary
to
protect
dual
purpose
organizations
from
having
their
noncampaignrelated
activities
disclosed.
dual
purpose
organizations
can
avoid
that
kind
of
disclosure
through
the
simple
expedient
of
setting
up
a
separate
organization
or
a
special
segregated
fund.
section
441b(b)
expressly
provides
for
that
contingency,
and
then
section
431
says
that,
well,
when
a
corporation
has
set
up
a
special
segregated
fund
for
purposes
of
campaign
activity,
only
the
activities
of
the
special
segregated
fund
constitute
a
political
committee,
and
only
those
activities
are
subject
to
disclosure.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
two
points
about
that.
first
of
all,
it
sounds
to
me
like
the
organization
that
you're
describing
would
be...
may
likely
be
constitutionally
exempt
under
the
massachusetts
citizens
for
life
exemption.
now,
if
you've
got
a
small
issue
advocacy
organization
that
only
makes
an
occasional
independent
expenditure
and
that
would
be
burdened
by
the
administrative
requirements
of
setting
up
a
special
segregated
fund,
then
clearly
under
mcfl
they're
entitled
to
a
constitutional
exemption.
they
have
that
safeguard.
aipac's
not
that
kind
of
an
organization,
a
large,
sophisticated
organization,
able
to
meet
many
administrative
requirements.
they
haven't
claimed
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--so
you're
saying
it's
a
contribution,
and...
well,
i
think
i
have
to
say
two
things
about
that.
number
1,
you
know,
every
person
is
presumed
to
know
the
law,
and
if
you
run
afoul
of
the
law
inadvertently,
but
in
the
manner
that
you've
described,
certainly
there
is
enforcement
discretion
that
the
fec
has,
can
exercise
and
say,
now,
this
one
time
thing
you
did,
you
made
a
mistake,
it
wasn't
a
wilful
violation,
you
didn't
know
what
you
were
doing,
you
can't
do
that
kind
of
thing,
don't
do
it
again,
and
that
would
be
an
appropriate
disposition
of
that
case.
what
we
have
here
with
respect
to
aipac
is
years
and
years
and
campaign
after
campaign
of
extensive
contributions
to
candidates,
and
the
public
needs
to
know
which
current
officeholders
were
the
recipients
of
aipac
campaign
contributions
so
they
can
know
in
the
next
election
cycle
who
they
should
vote
for,
considering
that
factor.
but
your
hypothetical
might
be
one
that
could
both...
that
might
fall
either
within
the
constitutional
exemption,
or
that
might
be
appropriately
subject
to
disposition
by
the
fec's
enforcement
discretion,
in
that
manner.
but
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
based
upon
the
voluminous
investigation
that
we
have
here,
there
are
very
substantial
campaign
contributions
over
an
extended
period
of
time
here,
and
i
think
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
that
hypothetical.
all
we
need
show
to
establish
redressability
is
a
likelihood
that
a
ruling
on
the
merits
will
result
in
disclosure.
we've
shown
the
likelihood.
the
court...
not
only
is
the
major
purpose
test
not
necessary
to
protect
against
what...
the
danger
that
the
fec
hypothesizes,
it's
not
sufficient
to
do
so,
either.
under
the
test
that
the
fec
has
clarified
it
to
be,
a
dual
purpose
organization
that
has
as
a
major
purpose
campaign
contributions
will
be
a
political
committee
even
if
another
major
purpose
of
the
organization
is
pure
issue
advocacy,
yet
under
their
own
test,
as
they
apply
it,
that
organization
as
a
whole
would
be
a
political
committee
and
be
subject
to
all...
full
disclosure.
for
this
reason,
of
all
its
activities,
including
the
noncampaign
activity,
the
test
is
neither
necessary
nor
sufficient
to
accomplish
the
goal
that's
put
forward
for
it,
and
it
eviscerates
the
statute,
because
the
problem
is,
it
exempts
from
disclosure
campaign
contributions,
not
just
noncampaign
activities.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
have
presented
the
argument
that
i
intended
to
present.
