justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
waxman,
i...
you're
addressing
the
merits,
and
do
you
mind
if
i
raise
a
preliminary
question
before
we
really
wade
into
the
merits
of
the
major
purpose
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
the
fec
changed
its
notion
of
who
are
members
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute
so
that
the
expenditures
that
were
made
here
might
be
ones
that
were
for
publications
that
went
to
members,
in
which
case
the
statute
wouldn't
be
involved
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
the
fec's
current
interpretation
and
application
of
who's
a
member,
would
the
mailings
here
have
gone
to
members?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
that
case
the
statute
wouldn't
be
invoked
at
all,
if
that
were--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
so
jurisprudentially,
what
do
we
do,
faced
with
this
question,
or
uncertainty?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
way
we
can
safely
reach
the
merits,
and
if
so,
how?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
these
plaintiffs
comply
with
all
of
those
steps?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
there
be
a
likelihood
of
disclosure
if
the
fec
takes
the
position
that
the
mailings
here
went
to
members?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
i'm
not
sure
it
is
so
likely
that
there
would
be
redressability.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
on
standing
we
have
to
see
if
it's
redressable,
and
i
guess
the
fec
has
some
leeway
in
determining
who
are
members
and
who
aren't
under
that
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
impacts
standing,
i
think.
i
mean,
it's
linked
somehow
with
redressability,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
can
they
set
up
a
special
segregated
fund
to
do
that?
