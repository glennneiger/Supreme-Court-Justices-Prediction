justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
congress,
instead
of
using
the
word
aggrieved,
had
said,
any
person
who
suffers
the
following
injury,
and
then
just
listed
the
things
that
you'd
said,
can
do
whatever
it
says
there,
would
that
have
violated
the
federal
constitution?
that
is,
would
we
have
lacked
standing
under
the
constitution?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes
because...
so
it's
constitutional,
do...
because
i
thought
person
aggrieved
in
a
statute,
the
word
aggrieved
traditionally
traces
back...
though
that
isn't
clear,
it
traces
back
to
sanders
brothers,
and
cases
that
did
use
that
to
refer
to
a
private
attorney
general,
at
least
arguably
so,
and
then
that's
why
i
wonder
if
it's
constitutional.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
say
that
what
they
would
like
is,
they
want
information,
and
they
think
that
if
the
fec
enforces
the
law,
in
their
view
of
what
it
is,
that
they
will
get
information
that
congress
by
statute
has
given
them
an
entitlement
to.
now,
why
isn't
that
a
real
injury--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--assuming
they
really
want
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
assume
they
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
took
the
voter
away...
if
we
took
the
vote,
if
we
closed
every
voting
booth
in
the
united
states,
every
voter
in
the
united
states
would
be
affected.
i
assume
they'd
have
standing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
the
simple
fact
that
everybody
is
affected
doesn't
always
show
they
don't
have
standing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
public,
each
member
of
the
public
may
not
have
a
right
in
the
sense
of
having
a
means
by
which
necessarily
it
can
compel
the
disclosure
of
the
information,
but
each
member
of
the
public
has
an
interest
in
getting
that
information.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you...
if
we
decided
the
redressability
on
the
basis
of
the
membership
question,
you're
no
better
off
if
we
related
that
to
standing
than
if
we
decided
it
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
we
decided
no
standing
because
of
the
special
problem
related
to
membership
affecting
redressability,
you
haven't
gotten
anywhere,
i
guess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--on
membership,
there's
one
little
thing
that's
bothering
me.
is
there
a
rule
in
their
proposed
rulemaking
that
would
make
members
nonmembers
of
those
who
both
contribute
50
dollars
and
have
the
right
to
affect
agency
policy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
they
published?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
we
know,
though,
that
aipac
has
conceded
or
not
conceded
that
they
both
get
the
50
dollars
and
the
member
has
a
right
to
affect
policy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
foresee
the
court
going
through
the
standing
question
and
then
deciding
in
your
favor,
which
is
what
you
want,
and
then
you'd
say,
well,
then
the
membership
issue
perhaps
comes
up
first,
in
which
case
i
guess
we'd
have
to
remand
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
not
remand
it
first?
i
mean,
why
go
through
this
standing
question?
do
we
have
to?
why
do
we
have
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--since
the
standing
question
may
well
turn
on
the
special
point
here,
on...
the
standing
question
could
well
turn
on
the
special
membership
point,
you
see,
making
it
more
difficult
for
the...
for
us
to
predict
that
you
could
obtain
the
relief
you
want
because
of
that
issue
being
in
the
case,
so
why
not
do
that
first,
and
send
it
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
that
so
easy?
that
is,
what
worries
me
about
your
position
on
the
merits
is
that
vast
numbers
of
organizations
who
suddenly
send
a
letter
to
their
members
once,
who
they
think
are
members,
the...
you
know,
congressman
jones
helped
save
the
brazilian
cardinal,
and
the...
the
bird--
[laughter]
--and
we
think
that
he's
a
wonderful
thing,
and
really
nice,
and
that's
it,
and
all
of
a
sudden
they
have
to
disclose
everybody
under
the
sun,
and...
you
know,
for
all
kinds
of
other
things
that
really
had
nothing
to
do
with
that
particular
letter
that
somebody
thought
was
a
nice
idea
to
send.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
by
the
way,
the
person,
before
he
wrote
the
letter,
talked
to
congressman
jones
and
said,
what
do
you
think
of
that?
oh,
a
great
idea,
he
said.
i
like--
