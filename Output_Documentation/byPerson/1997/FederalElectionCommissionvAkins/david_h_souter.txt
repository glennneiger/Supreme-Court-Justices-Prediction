justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
see
why
we
have
that
choice,
because
the
membership
issue
as
such
is
not
what
has
come
to
us.
justice
david
h.
souter
it
seems
to
me
the
only
thing
we
could
do,
if
we
are
going
to
advert
to
that
issue
at
all,
is
to
say,
it
is
in
a
state
of
ferment,
and
the
one
thing
that
seems
clear
is
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
redetermination,
whatever
the
result
may
be,
of
what
membership
means
at
the
commission
level,
and
we
ought
to
send
this
case
back
so
that...
so
that
if
it
ultimately
comes
to
us
it
will
come
to
us
on
a
concept
of
membership,
which
is...
which
for
the
foreseeable
future
will
be
the
permanent
one
and
will
give
us
a
good
reason
to
go
the
length
of
the
adjudication
that
you
want.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
i
understand
your
redressability
point
as
a
separate
point,
but
simply
with
respect
to
the
particularized
injury,
why
isn't
the
interest,
the
statutorily
provided
interest
in
getting
information
sufficient
on
that
first
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
the
argument
stronger
than
that?
they
are
being
deprived
of
information
by
virtue
of
the
fact
that
they
don't
know
whether
there
was,
in
fact,
a
contribution
made.
the
deprivation
of
the
information
is
not
contingent.
that's
actual.
they
don't
know
something,
and
that
something
that
they
don't
know,
it
seems
to
me,
is
what
the
statute
has
given
them
an
interest
in
finding
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
they're
saying,
i
have
been
harmed
because
i
have
an
interest
in
knowing
this.
that
interest
has
been...
has
been
infringed
because
they
haven't
filed,
et
cetera,
so
they
are
claiming
a
present
injury,
not
a
contingent
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
saying
the
harm
is
the
ignorance.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
statute
goes
the
step
further.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
schember,
may
i
go
to
a
different
point
on
this
redressability
issue?
isn't
it
also...
maybe
this
is
not
the
case.
isn't
it
also
your
position
that
redressability
should
be
judged
on
the
assumption
that
there
is
a
body
of
law
of
certain
content,
and
the
question
of
redressability
should
not
turn
on
whether
there
might
be
a
change
in
the
law?
is
that
your
position,
ultimately?
justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying
even
if
that's
not
so
there
are
other
grounds--
justice
david
h.
souter
--to
say
that
it
would
be
redressable,
but
at
the
base,
isn't
it
your
position
that
you
don't...
you
shouldn't
consider
a
change
of
law
in
determining
the
redressability
point?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
about
the...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
we're
not
talking
about
a
change
in
the
law.
the
question
is
whether
the
agency
interpreted
the
law
correctly,
and
the
d.c.
circuit
said
it
didn't,
that
it...
that
its
rule
that
was
applied
in
this
very
case,
whatever
the
right
rule
is,
that
was
the
wrong
rule.
