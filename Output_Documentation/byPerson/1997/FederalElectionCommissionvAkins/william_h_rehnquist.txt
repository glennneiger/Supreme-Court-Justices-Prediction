we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1590,
the
federal
election
commission
v.
james
e.
akins.
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you
say
in
just--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
you
say
in
deciding
those
questions
we
wouldn't
have
to
express
any
definitive
view
on
the
membership
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--yes.
it's
not
your
fault,
but
you've
used
up
15
minutes
discussing
an
issue
that
isn't
even
considered
in
the
briefs.
why
don't
you
go
to
the
issues
that
are
considered
in
the
briefs.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
general
waxman.
mr.
schember,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
about
cases
such
as
heckler
v.
chaney
and
linda
r.
s.,
where
we've
said
that
citizens
don't
have...
or
perhaps
someone
more
than...
you
don't
ordinarily
have
standing
to
require
that
a
person,
an
agency
or
a
prosecutor
commence
a
prosecution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
the
court's
reasoning
was
considerably
broader
than
that,
just
that
traditionally
private
individuals
do
not
have
any
claim
to
have
a
prosecutor
commence
something
that
is
discretionary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
saying
that
in
that
situation
the
fec
would
have
no
discretion
to
decline
prosecution?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schember,
could
your
clients
have
brought
this
action
as
an
apa
review
procedure
against
the
fec?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
ironic
in
a
way,
if
you
had
an
apa
remedy
and
you
would
have
been
barred
by
heckler
v.
chaney,
to
say
that
by
taking
this
other
remedy
you
solve
that
problem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
all
we
can
ask
of
you,
mr.
schembler.
[laughter]
thank
you.
you're
luckier
than
most.
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tuesday,
january
twentieth
at
ten
o'
clock.
