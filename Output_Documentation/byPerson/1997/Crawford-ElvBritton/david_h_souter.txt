justice
david
h.
souter
well--
justice
david
h.
souter
--then
credibility
determinations
basically
are
going
to
swallow
up
the
immunity
rule,
i
suppose,
if
the
summary
judgment
stays.
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
think
this
case
is
unusual
or
remarkable
in
that
respect?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how--
--well,
wouldn't
you...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what
about
the
case
in
which
the
prisoner
has
in
fact
taken
some
action,
as
in
this
case
in
going
to
the
press,
which
has
resulted
in
embarrassment
to
the
prison.
take
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
otherwise.
the
warden
says,
i
know
all
of
that.
yes,
he
spoke
to
the
press,
it
was
embarrassing,
but
that's
not
the
reason
i
did
this.
i
did
this
because
this
seemed
to
be
the
most
expeditious
way
of
getting
the
property
back
to
the
person.
would
the
fact
that
in...
on
your
theory,
would
the
fact
that
the
prison
had
been
embarrassed
be
a
sufficient
basis
for
raising
a
claim
of
improper
motivation
that
would
survive
the
summary
judgment--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
that
your...
your
argument--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
your
argument
here
is
not
merely
based
on
the
number
of
extraneous
remarks
that
the
prison
official
made,
but
on
the
assumption
that
this
was
not
the
expeditious
way
to
get
the
property
back.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
you
find
something
facially
incredible
about
the
explanation.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
my
example--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
my
example,
how
would
you
state
the
rule?
would
you
say
that
for...
should
we
come
down
with
a
rule
saying
that
for
summary
judgment
purposes
reasonable...
evidence
suggesting
an
improper
motivation,
even
on
the
part
of
a
reasonable
person,
is
insufficient
to
survive
the
summary
judgment
motion?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it's
more
than
surmise
and
guess
in
this
hypothetical.
most
people,
in
fact,
get
mad
when
they
are
embarrassed
in
the
public
print,
and
they
get
mad
at
the
people
who
are
causing
them
embarrassment.
that's
more
than
mere
speculation.
why,
therefore,
isn't
it
enough
to
survive?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
my
hypothetical
the
opposing
evidence
is
this.
the
prison
official
says,
i
did
this
only
because
i
thought
this
was
the
most
expeditious
way
to
get
things
back.
i
know
i
was
embarrassed,
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
on
the
other
side,
the
evidence
is
that
the
prisoner
went
to
the
press,
made
statements
that
were
published,
and
which
were
embarrassing
to
the
prison
administration.
now,
that's
more
than
mere
speculation.
they...
one
may
reasonably
infer
that
people
who
get
embarrassed
that
way
get
mad
at
the
people
who
cause
the
embarrassment.
you
say,
nonetheless...
i
thought
you
said
nonetheless
that,
in
fact,
the
prisoner's
claim
would
not
survive
summary
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
evidence
is
just
what
i
said.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
distinction
seems
to
be
a
mere
pleading
distinction.
in
my
hypothetical,
the
prison
official
said,
i
wasn't
influenced
by
this
embarrassment,
and
it
comes
out
one
way.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
prison
official
says,
well,
of
course
i
felt
some
motivation,
but
my
principal
concern,
and
the
predominant
purpose,
was
simply
to
get
the
property
to
the
prisoner
in
the
most
expeditious
way,
then
the
result
would
be
different?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
smith,
you
have
said
a
couple
of
times,
i
think,
that
in
the
case
of
these
intent
causes
of
action
like
this
one,
if
we
don't
have
some
such
mechanism
as
clear
and
convincing,
as
a
threshold
standard,
that
for
practical
purposes
summary
judgment
will
not
be
granted
and
qualified
immunity
will
be
a
dead
letter.
do
you
have
any
factual
evidence
in
the
record
to
that
effect?
do
we
have
an
empirical
basis
to
say
that
what
you're
saying
is
true?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
how
many...
do
we
have
any
basis
for
saying
how
many
of
those
cases
are
cases
in
which
improper
intent
is
alleged
with
a
substantial
basis
in
the
evidence,
even
though
ultimately
it
turns
out
that
the
jury
finds
otherwise?
those
are
the
ones
that
we're
trying
to
winnow
out.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
we
have
any
basis
for
apportioning
those
cases
as
against
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
know
he's
subject
to
suit,
but
i
mean,
how
do
we...
do
you
have
an
empirical
basis
for
telling
us
how
much
deserves
to
be
weeded
out
but
is
not
being
weeded
out
under
the
law
as
it
now
stands?
justice
david
h.
souter
are
those
in
your
brief
or
an
appendix--
justice
david
h.
souter
--state
and
federal?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
among
them
i
take
it
your
statistics
don't
give
us
a
way
to
estimate
the
number
of
cases
that
should
not
be
weeded
out
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
even
though
they
are
not
unsuccessful.
justice
david
h.
souter
as
distinct
from
those
that
should
be
and
are
also
ultimately
unsuccessful.
