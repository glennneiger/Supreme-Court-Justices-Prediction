mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
you
is
how
to
apply
harlow's
qualified
immunity
standard
when
a
government
officer
takes
action
that
is
lawful
on
its
face,
but
would
be
unlawful
if
taken
with
an
improper
motive.
the
issue
here
resurrects
the
very
same
problems
that
this
court
confronted
in
harlow.
here,
as
in
harlow,
if
qualified
immunity...
qualified
immunity
would
become
an
empty
gesture
if
an
officer
who
takes
reasonable
action
is
nevertheless
subject
to
suit
whenever
his
motivations
might
be
questioned.
we
submit
that
when
an
officer--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
the
statistics
provide
a
partial
answer
here,
and
the
statistics
i'll
cite
from
are
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
that
are
prepared
in
a
monograph
that
they
have
made
publicly
available
called
prisoner
petitions
in
the
federal
courts.
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
it's
not.
unfortunately
it
is
not,
but
generally
the
statistics
are
also
available
from
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts,
and
they
indicate
that
for
prisoner
petitions
approximately
40,000
prisoner
petitions
are
filed
each
year.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
federal
and
state
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--involving
civil
rights
claims.
of
those
cases,
about
60
percent
are
weeded
out
at
the
pleadings
stage,
but
that
still
leaves
16,000
cases
which
require
some
additional
treatment
of
one
kind
or
another.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no.
that
is
one
bit
of
evidence
that
we
do
not
know.
what
we
do
know
from
the
evidence
that's
provided
by
the
bureau
of
justice
statistics
is
that
about
40
percent
of
these
cases
arise
from
either
disciplinary
actions
or
claims
of
inadequate
medical
treatment,
or
claims
of
protection
of
personal
security,
all
types
of
cases
that
could,
in
fact,
involve
a
claim
of
impermissible
motive.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
simply
do
not
have
information
on
that,
but
we
do
have,
as
an
example,
this
case
here,
and
this
is
a
case
that
i
think
that
many
people
would
say
is...
presents
an
insubstantial
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
i
think
the
statistics
that
we
have
presented
do
suggest
that
there's
a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--problem
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
the
court
did
not,
and
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no,
it
did
not,
and
again,
i
think
the
statistics
we
have
here
are
helpful,
but
ultimately
the
decision
rests
with
you,
and
i
think
the
decision
has
to
be
drawn
from
the
principles
that
you
developed
in
harlow.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
we
are
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
they
don't,
and
i
think
ultimately
this
requires
the
exercise
of
judgment.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
i
do
disagree
with
you
there,
justice
stevens.
what
we're
proposing
here
is
a
limitation
on,
or
an
application
of
qualified
immunity
to
the
motivation--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
we
do
think
that
this
rule
ought
to
be
applied
as
part
of
the
qualified
immunity
defense,
and
let
me
explain
how
that
would
work,
and
i
think
the
easiest
way
to
focus
on
this
is
to
imagine
a
case
that's...
in
which
the
jury
is
being
instructed...
let's
suppose
we've
gotten
past
summary
judgment.
the
jury
will
be
instructed
that
the
plaintiff
has
to
come
forward
and
prove
his
constitutional
claim
and
then
the
jury
will
be
instructed,
if
you
find
that
that
claim
is
proved
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
then
you
must
consider
the
defendant's
qualified
immunity
defense
and,
accepting
your
hypothetical,
justice
stevens,
that
the...
there's
a
clearly
established
rule,
what
we're
asking,
that
there
be
an
additional
instruction
that
the
jury
be
told
that
you
must
find
that
there
was
a
firm
basis
for
believing
that
the
officer
had
an
improper
intent.
now,
we're
suggesting,
of
course,
that
this
same
standard
should
apply
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
as
well,
and
we
think
the
reason
why
it's
justified--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
that
is
the
difference
with
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
clear
and
convincing
evidence
is
evidence
sufficient
to
give
the
jury
a
firm
belief
of
an
improper
motive.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
yes,
we
think
that
he
can,
and
he
has
to
ask
the
same
question.
he
applies
that
standard
of
proof
that...
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
in
determining
the
summary
judgment
motion,
much
as
took
place
in
anderson
v.
liberty
lobby,
where
he
looks
at
the
factual
question
through
the
prism
of
the
appropriate
standard,
and
that
is
what
we're
suggesting
is
appropriate
here.
and
that
standard
is
necessary,
we
submit,
because
otherwise
there
will
always
be
these
types
of
claims
in
which
improper
motive
can
be
alleged
based
merely
on
inference
and,
because
the
judge
must
credit
the
inferences
in
favor
of
a
nonmoving
party,
these
cases
will
go
on
and
be
subjected
to
a
jury
trial
even
though
it's
very
unlikely
that
they
will
proceed,
or
that
they
will
produce
a
verdict,
and
that
is
something
that
we
do
have
statistics
on.
we
do
know
that
only
1
percent
of
the
criminal...
of
the
prisoner
petition
cases
ultimately
result
in
court-ordered
relief
for
the
prisoner
out
of
the
40,000
cases
that
the
district
courts
are
charged
with
handling,
and
that
seems
to
me
that
is
significant.
it
does
indicate
to
us
that
there
is
a
need
for
additional
winnowing--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
they
do
tell
us
how
many
of
those
cases
went
to
trial.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
roughly
about
3
percent
of
the
cases--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--yes,
and
what
we're
concerned
about
also...
not
just
the
3
percent.
i
take
that
back.
we're
also
concerned
about
those
cases
in
which
there's
extensive
discovery
where
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
is
ultimately
granted
after
the
plaintiff
has
conducted
deposition
after
deposition
and
the
court
concludes
that
in
fact
there
is
not
sufficient
factual
evidence
to
support
the
claim.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
we
think
that
in
fact
justice
ginsburg
in
the
court
of
appeals
has
suggested
an
appropriate
approach
with
regard
to
discovery,
and
as
a
separate
matter
he
has
suggested
that
discovery
should
not
go
forward
unless
it's
likely
to
produce
sufficient
evidence
to
achieve
the
desired
result
at
trial.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff
has
to
produce
some
evidence
of
an
improper
motive
and,
in
addition,
must
show
that
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
he
can
produce
evidence
through
discovery
that
will--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
this
is
the
same
type
of
balancing
determination
that
a
court
always
has
to
make
under
rule
26(b)(2)(3).
there's
always
a
question
of
the
burdens
and
benefits
of
discovery,
and
the
benefits
of
discovery
is
the
likelihood
of
the
evidence
being
produced.
the
plaintiff
is
obligated
when
he
submits
his
rule
56(f)
affidavit
to
indicate
what
his
basis
for
believing
is
that
this
discovery
will
be
fruitful,
so
in
fact
the
district
judge
will
have
a
basis
to
make
that
determination.
he
will
be
able
to
look
at
what
the
plaintiff
is
suggesting
he
will
obtain
on
discovery,
and
he
can
make
a
reasoned
judgment
of
whether
or
not
he's
likely
to
obtain
the
evidence
he
thinks
he
will
receive.
in
a
case
such
as
this,
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
the
intended
deposition
of
ms.
britton
is
unlikely
to
produce
anything
more
than
what
her
deposition
states,
namely
that
she
did
this
for
a
proper
purpose.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
her
affidavit
that
she
had
prepared
in
an
earlier
stage
of
this
proceeding.
and
with
regard
to
that,
i'd
also
like
to
note
that
in
this
case
the...
it's
very
easy
to
make
factual
allegations
along
the
way.
if
you
look
to
what
the
fourth
amended
complaint
actually
states
in
this
case
on
page
185
of
the
petition,
it
indicates
that
the
plaintiff
himself
indicates
that
ms.
britton
was
acting
in
order
to
protect
the
prisoner's
property.
he
made
that
allegation
in
his
complaint.
what
we
find
is
that
the
facts,
the
factual
allegations
change
as
the
case
moves
forward.
ultimately,
that
takes
me
back
to
my
point
with
regard
to
restrictions
on
discovery.
we
do
think
that
it's
appropriate
not
only
to
have
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
here,
but
also
to
require
that
there
be
limitations
on
discovery
to
ensure
that
that
discovery
is
limited
and
narrowed
to
that...
to
those
areas
that
are
in
fact
of
vital
importance
in
proving
the
plaintiff's
case.
now,
there's
also
been
some
suggestion
in
the
questions
from
the
court
about
your
authority...
i
see
my
time
has
expired.
