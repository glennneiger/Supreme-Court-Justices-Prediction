justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
suppose
you're
right
that
the
rules
and
the
procedures
are
fully
sufficient
if
we
wish
to
devote
a
huge
amount
of
resources
to
complaints
of
this
type
and
to
subject
officials
who
have
a
claim
of
immunity
to
prolonged
discovery.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
those
two
factors
are
eliminated,
then
i
suppose
you're
quite
right,
the
rules
are
quite
adequate.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
cost
of
these
proceedings
to
the
government
official
who
wishes
to
assert
the
immunity
are
so
high
that
the
purpose
of
the
immunity
is
substantially
lost.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
am
i
wrong
that
that's
the
question?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
your
whole
argument
here
has
been
built
around
mount
healthy
and
around
the
premise
that
there
is
really
no
substantial
problem
with
suits
brought
by
prisoners
and
other
persons
against
governmental
officials
that
are
not
common
to
the
entire
litigation
system
so
there
should
be
no
special
rules.
isn't
that
the
gravamen
of
your
submission?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
harlow
your
best
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
about
our
general
authority
to
formulate
rules
that
will
give
meaning
and
substance
and
force
to
the
sovereign
immunity
defense
from
a
procedural
standpoint.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
make
it
up
based
on
our
assessment
of
the
needs
of
the
judicial
system
quite
apart
from
common
law
analogues,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
civil
fraud
context
we
did
it
in
the
context
of
the
federal
rules,
is
that
not
correct,
or
is
that
incorrect?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
said
we've
done
this
in
the
civil
fraud
context.
i
thought
this
was
a
heightened
pleading
requirement
in
rule
9.
