justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
then
how
exactly,
in
your
view,
do
you
deal
with
the
problem?
you
may
say
there
is
no
problem,
but
i
take
it,
the
problem,
to
be
that
many
prisoners
will
file
pieces
of
paper
in
federal
court
that
they
call
a
complaint.
they
won't
be
sent
to
the
judge,
actually.
they'll
be
sent
to
a
magistrate,
and
the
magistrate's
normal
inclination
under
notice
pleading
is,
discovery
is
fine.
but
here,
they
say
that
in
these
cases
where
motives
are
alleged,
it's
a
great
burden
upon
the
prison
official
to
have
to
sit
at
a
deposition,
and
there's
no
real
reason
for
it,
so
the
first
thing
you'd
want
to
do
is
require
the
prisoner
to
say
what
he's
talking
about
in
detail,
but
i
guess
we
can't
do
that
under
the
federal
rules.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
maybe
there
are
some
other
things
we
could
do.
i
want
your
view
on
what
we
should
do
about
that
problem,
including,
if
you
like,
denying
that
it's
a
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
say
in
the
reply.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
are
the...
well.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
want
to
know
what
particular
rules
you
will
work
with
to
produce
this
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it...
so,
please,
finish.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you're--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
it
would
apply
across
the
board--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--then
you
have
to
be
careful,
because,
you
know,
a
lot
of
these
claims
might
be
very,
very
good.
there
might
be
prisoner
ones
that
are
good,
so
how
do
you
winnow
them
out,
and
my
question
is,
what
is
wrong
with
just
following
the
present
rules?
suppose
you
said
that,
first,
when
the
prisoner
files
a
claim
which
you
can't
really
understand,
which
very
often
happens,
that
the
official
who's
being
sued
can
ask
for
a
reply,
and
that
reply
at
the
judge's
or
magistrate's
discretion
can
describe
in
detail
what
he
knows
and
what
he's
talking
about.
then
the
second
thing
is,
having
obtained
that,
the
official
can
move
for
summary
judgment
under
56,
at
which
point
discovery
will
not
take
place
unless
the
judge
decides
under
56(f)
that
justice
so
requires,
et
cetera,
using
the
standard
of
56(f),
and
we
could
say,
you
have
to
be
very
careful
where
motive
is
alleged.
anyone
can
allege
it.
there
are,
you
know,
all
these
considerations
that
you're
concerned
about.
so
the
magistrate
would
have
full
power
to
deal
with
the
case,
understanding
that
it's
likely
to
be
special,
and
understanding
all
the
things
you
argue.
what's
wrong
with
that
as
a
special
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
rules.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
the
numbers
i
saw--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the
number
i
saw
on
this
very
point
in
the
record
was
something
like
500-some-odd
cases.
does
that
ring
a
bell,
that
number?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
true,
but
that's
500-and-some-odd
cases
out
of,
let's
say,
80,000
prisoners,
and
if...
that
doesn't
seem
like
an
enormous...
i
mean,
on
its
face,
that
didn't
seem
overwhelming
as
a
problem.
i
don't
know
how
many
prisoners
there
are,
80
or
90,000,
probably.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
federal
system
probably
has
80,000,
does
it,
something--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
there
are
close
to
a
million
prisoners
in
the
state
systems,
and
so...
perhaps
more
than
a
million,
and
so
is
the...
it
seemed
like
a...
i
mean,
i
don't
know
what
to
make
of
this.
that's--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
rule
might--
--this
case...
i
have
no
idea
about
this
case,
but
why
shouldn't
we
say,
look,
the
department
of
justice
has
whole
groups
of
people
whose
job
it
is
to
collect
statistics.
you're
asking
us
to
create
a
special
rule
that
would
undoubtedly
inevitably
cut
off
some
good
claims,
and
therefore
if
you
want
us
to
create
a
special
rule
to
deal
with
a
special
situation
of
harassment
to
public
officials
for
claims
that
are
not
good,
why
doesn't
the
department
have
the
burden
of
coming
in
with
the
statistics
that
show
it's
a
real
problem?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
i
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--from
the
statistics
is
that
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
and
60
percent
get
weeded
out,
and
it
doesn't
seem
like
that
much
compared
to
the
number
of
prisoners,
then
somebody
else
might
say
the
same,
and
we
don't
know
how
many
deal
with
the
motive,
and
we
don't
know
whether
the
best
way
is
to
have
a
higher
proof
on
the
substance,
or
whether
it's
better
to
get
simply
more
elaborate
pleadings,
or
whether
it's
better
to
have
special
ways
of
enforcing
discovery
requirements...
i
mean,
there
are
many,
many
ways
of
dealing
with
it,
if
it's
a
problem.
mr.
minear,
did
the
court
require
some
special
research
and
statistics
before
it
decided
harlow?
