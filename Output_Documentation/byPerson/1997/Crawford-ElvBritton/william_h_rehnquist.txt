chief
justice

rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-827,
leonard
rollon
crawford-el
v.
patricia
britton.
mr.
schember.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schember,
speaking
more
generally
there's
talk
of
discovery
abuses
not
just
in
this
case
but
throughout
the
country,
and
the
answer
often
is,
well,
the
district
judges
have
it
within
their
power
to
prevent
that,
and
i
think
a
lot
of
people
agree
that's
true,
but
you
have
700
district
judges
in
the
country
and
they
just
react
differently
to
this
sort
of
problem.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you're
talking
about
intent,
though,
that's
a
very
difficult
issue
to
get
summary
judgment
on,
because
it's
the
subjective
state
of
someone's
mind,
and
it's
just
something
that
ordinarily
it
goes
to
a
trier
of
fact,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schember,
suppose--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
schember,
supposing
you
take
this
in
a
context,
just,
say,
within
the
prison,
and
the
prisoner
comes
up
to
the
respondent
here
and
says,
look,
i've
told
you
before,
i
think
your
system
is
wrong,
you're
wrong
in
denying
me
those
privileges
i
asked
for,
and
she
says
to
him,
look,
i
just
don't
want
to
hear
any
more
from
you,
i've
decided
that,
and
he
says,
okay,
i'm
filing
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
saying
that
for
a
bad
motive
you
disciplined...
you're
doing
something
to
me
because
i
petitioned
you.
now,
is
that
a
cognizable
claim?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
would
have
to
go
to
trial,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he's
saying,
look,
you
say
you
would
have
done
the
same
thing,
but
i
say
you
wouldn't
have
done
the
same
thing,
and
that's
a
question
of
fact.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
is
the
trier
of
fact
permitted
to
infer
from
the
fact
that
the
official
did
in
your
view
impair
this
person's
first
amendment
rights
here--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--with
a
bad
motive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that's
quite
contrary
to
ordinary...
the
ordinary
rule
we
apply.
yes.
that,
you
know,
you
say
the
jury
could
have
found,
but
if
you
say
the
jury
could
have
found,
ordinarily
that's
a
question
of
fact.
if
you...
you
have
to
say
the
jury
must
have
found
for
want
of
any
other
evidence
before
you
get
summary
judgment,
i
thought.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
schember,
you're
talking
about
what
i
guess
is
an
affirmative
defense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
the
ordinary
rule
of
summary
judgment
is
that
the...
all
factual
issues
are
resolved
against
the
moving
party
on
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
on
a
question
of
intent
like
this,
that
justice
souter
is
posing,
or...
it
seems
to
be
very
difficult
under
ordinary
rules
of
summary
judgment
to
get
summary
judgment
for
the
defendant,
where
the
defendant
says,
i
acted
on
a
proper
motive.
i
did
not
act
on
an
improper
motive.
but
there
are
some
things
which
would
permit
an
inference.
a
finder
of
fact
could
infer
that
there
was
an
improper
motive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the...
neither
the
jury
nor
the
judge
on
summary
judgment
are
bound
by
that
statement.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
that's
right--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--because
i
think
on
a
question
of
intent
like
that
a
jury
is
entitled
to
disbelieve
any
witness,
or
any
party.
you
know,
the...
a
jury
can
disbelieve
the
defendant.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
also
true
on
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
smith,
the
court
of
appeals
certainly
regarded
this
as
a
qualified
immunity
case,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
justice...
judge
williams'
opening
sentence
says,
we're
here
to
decide
this
issue
about
qualified
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
mr.
minear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
in
miranda?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
very
good
as
well
as
a
charge
to
the
jury,
mr.
minear,
but
how
does
a
judge
on
a
summary
judgment
stage...
is
there
some
way
he
can
distinguish
between
a
claim
that
is
supported
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
but
not
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
he
know
what
he
can
produce
through
discovery
until
he
has
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
her
affidavit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
