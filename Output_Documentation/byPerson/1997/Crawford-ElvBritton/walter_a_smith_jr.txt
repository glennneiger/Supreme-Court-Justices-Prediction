mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner's
counsel
has
just
said
that
in
his
view
the
gravament
of
his
position
is
that
there
needn't
be
any
special
rules
at
all.
i
think
the
court
has
already
decided
in
harlow
that
there
have
to
be,
so
i'd
like
to
argue
two
points
to
you.
first,
that
in
wrongful
intent
cases
such
as
this
there
needs
to
be
some
kind
of
heightened
standard
applied
to
protect
public
officials
with
regard
to
determining
whether
they
had
a
wrongful
intent
or
not,
because
if
you
don't
have
some
kind
of
special
heightened
standard
the
result
is
going
to
be,
in
nearly
all
of
these
cases,
we're
going
to
put
public
officials
through
discovery,
past
summary
judgment,
and
into
trial,
and
that
will
cause
all
of
the
harm
to
effective
government
and
all
of
the
harm
to
the
public
interest
that
this
court
in
harlow
designed
a
rule
to
prohibit,
and
i
think
he's
quite
wrong
to
say
that
we
can
simply
rely
on
the
normal
rules
to
take
care
of
the
case.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
on
the
merits
we
would,
but
since
we
did
interpose
qualified
immunity,
your
honor,
there
are
two
parts
to
the
qualified
immunity.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
i
guess
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
i
would
say
this
case
is
about
whether
or
not
ms.
britton's
assertion
of
good
faith
in
the
actions
that
she
took
is
going
to
be
upheld
under
the
qualified
immunity
doctrine.
the
court
said
there
are
two--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
but
the
court
said
there
are
two
parts
to
the
good
faith
immunity.
one
is
what
the
court
called
objective.
the
other
is
what
the
court
called
subjective,
and
in
harlow--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--that
is
true.
that
is
true,
but
good
faith
immunity
is
called,
i
think,
your
honor,
good
faith
immunity
precisely
because
it's
designed
to
assure
public
officials
that
if
they
act
in
good
faith,
as
harlow
said,
cases
against
them
will
be
promptly
dismissed,
according
to--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--i
think
that's
right,
your
honor,
but
there
was
a
second
part
to
the
good
faith
immunity,
and
that
is
the
intent.
the
first
part
is
the
one
you
just
mentioned,
knowledge
of
the
law,
and
the
court
said
that
we
weren't
going
to
allow
inquiries
into
the
knowledge.
now
we're
trying
to
figure
out
what
to
do
when
the
claim
is
with
regard
to
improper
intent.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
once
again--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct,
and
there's
no
doubt
that,
in
fact,
the
qualified
immunity
defense
was
raised
in
the
trial
court.
that's
why
the
court
of
appeals
ended
up
addressing
it.
i'd
like
to
respond
to
something
justice
scalia
said,
though.
he
said
that
in
harlow
we
had
found
a
mechanism
for
making
sure
we
didn't
have
to
have
an
inquiry
into
the
knowledge
part.
what
we
now
need
to
find
is
a
mechanism
to
make
sure
that
we
don't
have
subjective
inquiries
into
the
intent
part,
because
that
can
do
just
as
much
damage
to
the
purposes
of
the
harlow
decision
as
inquiries
into
the
knowledge
of
the
law.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
they
are
two
different
things,
your
honor,
but
i
would
try
to
argue
to
you
they're
both
part
of
the
good
faith
immunity,
and
before
harlow
the
court
said
there
were
two
parts
to
the
inquiry,
one
that
the
court
called
subjective,
and
one
that
the
court
called
objective,
but
they
both
had
to
do
with
the
state
of
the
mind
of
the
official.
one
is
the
knowledge
of
the
law
in
the
mind
of
the
official,
the
other
is
whether
or
not
there's
improper
intent.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
right.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
oh,
i
wasn't
trying
to
make
it
irrelevant,
your
honor.
i'm
trying
to
make
it
part
of
the
qualified
immunity
inquiry
and
find
a
way
to
assure
that
the
qualified
immunity
will
be
given
to
the
official
without
having
to
go
through
discovery
and
trial,
and
my
point
is
that
if
you
don't
have
some
kind
of
what
justice
scalia
was
calling
a
special
mechanism,
nearly
every
one
of
these
cases
where
improper
intent
is
alleged
is
going
to
have
to
go
through
discovery
and
trial,
bringing
about
all
of
the
harm
that
harlow
was
designed
to
prohibit.
that's
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make,
and
we
need
to
find,
again
to
use
justice
scalia's
words,
i
think
a
mechanism
for
assuring
that
what
the
court
said
in
harlow
should
not
occur...
a
subjective
inquiry...
will
not
occur
here
either.
we
must
find
a
way
to
assure
public
officials
that
when
they
act
in
good
faith
in
their
positions,
insubstantial
claims
against
them
will
be
promptly
dismissed.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
me,
too.
[laughter]
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
you're
writing
it.
i
am
suggesting,
as
the
court
has
often
said...
you're
interpreting
section
1983,
and
the
court
has
often
said
that
there
are
two
parts
to
that.
what
was
the
state
of
common
law
immunity
at
the
time
when
the
statute
was
adopted,
and
are
there
other
special
policy
considerations?
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
i
think
you
are
authorized
to
make
that
determination,
your
honor,
for
the
same
reason
you're
authorized
to
determine
the
burden
of
proof
in
a
statute
where
congress
hasn't
provided
what
the
burden
of
proof
will
be,
and
for
the
same
reason
you're
authorized
to
define
and
refine
the
contours
of
the
qualified
immunity.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
about
defining
and
refining?
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
harlow,
wyatt,
i
would
cite
woodby
v.
ins,
where
the
court
adopted
a
clear
and
convincing
standard,
and
said
it
was
doing
so
in
part
because
congress
had
not
established
the
standard,
and
it
was
a
particularly,
peculiarly
judiciary
function
to
determine
what
the
burden
of
proof--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--no,
not
quite
apart,
your
honor.
i
think
when
you
do
it
you
are
interpreting
the
statute,
and
you
interpret
the
statute
on
the
basis
of,
the
court
has
said,
two
things,
both
policy
considerations
and
what
the
state
of
common
law
immunity
was
at
the
time
the
statute
was
adopted.
i
mean--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--i
think
the
best
support
we
have
in
the
record,
the
statistics
that
are
before
the
court,
the
best
ones
are
cited
in
judge
silberman's
opinion
at
page
38a
and
56a,
and
in
the
amicus
brief
for
the
states
at
page
12,
and
in
the
amicus
brief
for
the
united
states
at
pages
1
and
2,
and
i
think
if
you
read
all
of
those
data
together,
they
do
say
one
important
thing.
we
have
an
explosion
of
cases
in
this
area.
almost
half
of
them
are
prisoner
cases,
and
nearly
all
of
them
are
ultimately
determined
to
be
nonmeritorious,
but
you
can
always
allege
improper
intent
in
such
cases
and,
under
the
rules
that
we
now
have,
you
can
almost
always
get
through
in
discovery
and
trial
in
such
cases.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
data
will
tell
you
which
are
improper
intent
cases
and
which
are
not,
but
this
much
we
know.
improper
intent
is
very
easy
to
allege,
particularly
in
the
prisoner
context,
particularly--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--it
would
apply,
i
think,
your
honor,
across
the
board,
as
the
court
said
in
harlow.
now,
you
may
find
at
some
later
date
you
need
to
refine
it
for
some
reason,
but
i
think
the
core
reason
we're
asking
for
some
kind
of
special
standard
be
applied
here,
would
apply
across
the
board,
and--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--go
ahead.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
no,
i'd
rather
hear
your
question.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
across
the
board
to
all
cases.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
because
you're
still--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--i
think,
your
honor,
in
the
mind
run
of
the
cases,
you're
still
going
to
go
to
trial.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
because
we're
going
to
have
credibility
determinations,
or
we're
going
to
have,
as
the
chief
justice
said,
a
situation
where
all
of
the
evidence
has
to
be--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--i
don't
think
we
have
the
data
that
have
actually
counted--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--what
i
said
there
were
a
lot
of,
your
honor,
are
claims
of
this
kind,
and
what
i--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--and
my
answer
is...
the
answer
has
to
be
no,
because
under
the
governing
standards
you
have
to
let
credibility
determinations
or
any
case
in
which
any
permissible
inference
can
be
drawn
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff,
you
have
to
let
them
go
forward.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
that's
the
nub
of
the
problem
the
court
discussed
in
harlow.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
the
500
number
is
in
the
u.s.'s
brief,
but
that's
only
for
bivens.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
well,
the--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--yes.
the
numbers
of
the
prisoner
cases,
though,
are
in
the
states'
brief,
and
in
the
data
that
judge
silberman
relied
on.
they
are
in
the
thousands.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
my
view...
my
view,
your
honor,
would
be
two
things.
first
of
all,
thousands
of
cases
puts
quite
a
burden
on
the
district
courts,
but
the
more
important
point,
i
think,
is
that
the
policy
consideration
that
drove
harlow
was
that
if
you
permit
cases
like
this
to
proceed,
you
will
dampen
the
ardor
of
public
officials.
unless
public
officials
are
certain
that
these
insubstantial
suits
are
going
to
be
promptly
dismissed
before
discovery
and
trial,
the
risk
is
great,
the
harlow
court
said,
that
these
public
officials
are
not
going
to
be
unflinching
in
their
duties,
and
at
a
given
prison,
it
would
only
take
one
such
claim
to
do
that
kind
of
harm.
just
let
one
of
these
cases
linger
and
occupy
the
time
of
a
public
official,
challenging
what
i
still
want
to
call
their
good
faith,
just
one
of
them
can
dampen
their
ardor
with
regard
to
other
situations.
they
will
be
afraid
to
take
action
that
might
engender
another
lawsuit,
and
we
would
submit
that
is
the
core
of
harlow,
and
it
is
why
some
kind
of
special
rule
needs
to
be
applied.
i
haven't
talked
yet
about
clear
and
convincing.
obviously,
you
have
to
first
be
persuaded
that
some
kind
of
heightened
standard
is
needed
in
order
to
address
the
problem.
i
would
like
just
to
take
the
last
few
moments,
with
the
court's
permission,
to
tick
off
what
i
think
are
four
reasons
why
clear
and
convincing
is
the
right
kind
of
heightened
standard
to
use
in
these
cases.
first
of
all,
and
this
will
be
abbreviated,
as
judge
williams
said
in
his
opinion,
this
is
a
situation
where
we
had
asymmetry
in
the
risk
of
error.
that
is
to
say,
the
court
has
already
determined
in
harlow
itself
that
some
meritorious
cases
must
be
turned
away
in
order
to
serve
the
greater
good
of
ensuring
that
insubstantial
cases
will
be
promptly
dismissed,
and
it's
in
an
asymmetry
of
error
situation
the
court
has
often
adopted
clear
and
convincing.
his
second
reason
was
that
this
is
a
case
where,
just
to
use
his
words,
motive
is
easy
to
allege
and
hard
to
disprove.
that,
too,
suggests
that
we
need
a
benefit
of
the
doubt
for
public
officials,
and
that's
a
point
the
court
made
in
harlow
itself,
where
it
said
at
page
814,
note
23,
dishonest
or
vindictive
motives
are
readily
attributed
and
as
readily
believed,
actually
raising
the
specter
that
we
may
have
public
officials
who
are
completely
innocent
of
the
charge
but
would
be
found
guilty
because
of
the
tenuousness
of
the
kind
of
evidence
we're
dealing
with.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
would--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--oh,
i...
i
would--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
again,
we
don't
have
the
exact
numbers,
but
i
would
suggest
that
in
other
contexts
you
still
have
the
problem--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--i
would
suggest
an
across-the-board
approach
is
the
best
approach
but,
your
honor,
as
i'm
sure
you
would
put
it,
i'll
take
what
i
can
get
here--
[laughter]
--if,
in
fact,
you
want
to
hold
this
only
for
prisoners.
could
i
mention
the
other
two
reasons,
though?
one
is
that
i
think
you've
done
this
in
analogous
situations,
not
only
in
the
civil
fraud
context,
but
i
think
new
york
times
may
be
the
best
analogy.
there,
in
order
to
protect
the
public's
great
interest
in
uninhibited
public
debate,
you
adopt
a
clear
and
convincing
standard.
so,
too,
i
would
suggest,
to
serve
the
public
interest
in
having
uninhibited
public
official
decisionmaking,
it's
important
to
adopt
the
clear
and
convincing--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--well,
i
think--
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
--no,
the
court
in
woodby,
your
honor,
referred
to
various
different
situations
where
courts
have,
in
a
civil
fraud
context,
adopted
a
clear
and
convincing
test.
and
the
fourth
one
i'd
like
to
mention
is
the
presumption
of
regularity,
which
the
court
noted
as
long
ago
as
the
united
states
v.
chemical
case
and
reaffirmed
in
armstrong,
which
is,
there
should
be
a
presumption
of
regularity
to
validate
decisions
of
public
officials
in
the
absence...
and
this
was
the
key
phrase,
i
think...
in
the
absence
of
clear
evidence
to
the
contrary.
it
seems
to
me
that,
too,
supports
the
view
that
clear
and
convincing
is
the
right
kind
of
heightened
standard
to
use
here,
although
i'll
say
in
response
to
something
justice
breyer
said
our
primary
point
is
that
something
has
to
be
done
to
assure
public
officials
that
these
insubstantial
claims
will
not
put
them
through
discovery
and
trial.
we
think
clear
and
convincing
is
the
best
choice.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
i
do
think
it's
better
than
the
heightened
pleading
rule,
for
the
reasons
i've
been
saying,
but
it's
not
as
rigid,
say,
as
the
direct
evidence
rule,
which
i
think
frankly
made
it
too
tough
on
some
plaintiffs,
because
most
of
these
cases
are
circumstantial
evidence
cases.
i
mean,
i
think
it's
important
to
say
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
done
here
with
a
difficult
problem
is
find
a
middle-of-the-road
course.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
ginsburg.
mr.
walter
a.
smith,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
thank
you.
