ruth
bader
ginsburg
how
would
you
compare
it
to
other
cases?
you
said,
don't
worry
because
this
discovery
is
going
to
be
limited
and
there's
going
to
be
summary
judgment,
but
you
say
in
this
case,
if
i
understand
you
right,
this
one's
got
to
go
to
trial.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
i
suppose
you
would
say
the
same
thing
about
that
martin
case
and
about
martin
v.
malhoyt,
another
d.c.
circuit
case,
so
i'm
trying
to
see
where
there
is
a
match.
i
think
there
is
none.
for
the
harlow,
when
you're
talking
about
the
legal
standard,
then
we
have
clearly
established
law.
here,
on
the
surface
everything
looks
lawful.
what
makes
it
unlawful
is
a
clearly
unconstitutional
design,
either
race
discrimination,
first
amendment
violation,
but
on
the
surface
everything
looks
okay.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well
then,
i
gather
what
you're
saying
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
there
shouldn't
be
any
match
on
the
subjective
intent
side
to
what
this
court
has
installed
on
the...
purely
on
the
what-the-law-is
side
in
harlow.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
other
words,
harlow
inserted
a
test,
and
it
is
that
it's
not
only
that
there
was
a
violation
of
law,
and
it's
not
only
that
the
law
was
established,
but
it
must
be
clearly
established.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now
you're
saying,
but
where
the
law
would
not
be
in
doubt
if
the
motive
is
unconstitutional,
then
there
is
no...
nothing
special
for
these
official...
officials.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it
isn't
an
intent
part
and
a
knowledge
part.
there
are
two
discrete
kinds
of
wrongful
acts.
in
the
harlow
thing
it
was
a
question
of
whether
the
law
had
been
violated
and
the
court's
answer
was,
there's
qualified
immunity
unless
that
law
was
clearly
established.
now,
here,
there
isn't
any
question
that
if
the
motive
that's
alleged
exists,
what
was
done
was
terribly
unlawful,
so
the
two...
you
can't
just
mix
them
together
and
say
they're
all
part
of
the
same
kind
of
tortious
conduct.
one
is,
did
i
act
in
violation
of
the
law,
and
the
other
is,
what
was
in
my
head,
because
if
one
thing
was
in
my
head,
then
i
acted
in
violation
of
the
law,
if
another
thing
was,
i
didn't,
so
they're
two
different
kinds
of
torts.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
let's
just
say...
let's
just
say,
when
it's
a
question
of
what
the
law
is,
that
we
want
to
make
intent
irrelevant.
we
just
want
to
know,
was
this
clearly
established
law?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
the
kind
of
tort
we're
talking
about
here,
the
intent
is
everything.
you
can't
make
it
irrelevant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
that
in
fact
what's
happening
now?
i
mean,
somebody
asked
if
there
was
any
empirical
information.
how
many
cases
like
this
actually
go
to
trial
without
any
heightened
pleading
rules
or
heightened
proof
burden
rules?
how
many?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well...
because
you
said
there
were
a
lot.
i
thought
i
heard
you
say
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes,
but
do
they
get...
the
question
is,
do
they
get
weeded
out
efficiently
without
any
heightened
pleading
rules,
any
additional
proof
burden
rules?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
better
than
the
heightened
pleading
rule
which
this
court
hasn't
held
is
out
the
window
with
respect
to
individuals,
as
distinguished
from
municipalities?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you're
not
supporting
judge
silberman's
approach,
then.
you're
just
supporting
the
combination
of
williams
and--
