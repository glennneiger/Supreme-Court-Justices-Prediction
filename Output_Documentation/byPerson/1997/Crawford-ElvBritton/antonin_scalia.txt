justice
antonin
scalia
it
still
gets
you
into
subjective
investigations,
which
is
really
what
we
tried
to
put
behind
us
in
harlow.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
really
tried
to
make
this
an
objective
inquiry.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
clearly
established
law
principle
was
simply
the
device
which
would
enable
an
objective
determination
to
be
made
in
harlow.
what
this
case
requires,
if
we're
to
follow
the
philosophy
of
harlow,
is
some
other
device
that
would
likewise
produce
an
objective
test
rather
than
a
subjective
one.
now,
i'm
not
sure
that
what
the
d.c.
circuit
majority
did
here
does
that.
it's
still
a
subjective
test
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
but
judge
silberman's
test
would
certainly
do
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
given
these
facts,
could
a
reasonable
person
have
taken
this
action.
if
so,
end
of
the
matter.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
as
in
harlow
we
eliminated
claims
that
were
based
upon
subjective
intent.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
surely
be
read
as
an
attempt
by
this
court
to
make
the
section
1983
inquiry
an
objective
inquiry
rather
than
a
subjective
one.
surely
that
was
the
whole
driving
force
behind
harlow.
justice
antonin
scalia
why...
you
can
always
make
this
claim
that
what
was
done
was
done
with
a...
with
an
intent
to
deprive
me
of
a
constitutional
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can't
always
be
proven.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
this
any
different
from
harlow
in
this
respect:
why
couldn't
we
have
said
the
same
thing
in
harlow
that
you're
saying
to
us
now,
namely,
this
can
be
handled
by
pretrial
discovery
if...
so
long
as
you
assert
that,
number
1,
the
constitution
was
violated,
and
number
2,
the
officer
knew
he
was
violating
the
constitution?
never
mind
that
it
wasn't
clearly
established,
he
knew
he
was
violating
the
constitution,
and
that
was
his
intent.
what's
the
problem?
just
have
pretrial
discovery,
and
if
you
can't
show
that
was
his
intent,
we
just
simply
dismiss
the
case.
but
we
didn't
take
that
course
in
harlow.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
why
this
is
any
different.
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
why
do
we
have
to
do
that?
is
that
our
job?
i
mean,
i
hate
to
contradict
myself,
but--
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
interpreting
a
statute
here.
it's
either
there
or
it's
not
there.
you're
talking
as
though,
you
know,
we're
writing
the
law.
we're
not
writing
this
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
could
we...
i
mean,
i
just
don't
know
where
we
plucked
this
notion
of
clear
and
convincing
evidence
from.
are
we
free
to
pick
and
choose
the
propositions
that
we're
going
to
allow
to
be
established
by
a
preponderance
and
other
propositions
only
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
--are
you
proposing
this
rule
just
for
criminal...
for
prisoner
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
this
asymmetry
that
you're
talking
about
may
not
necessarily
apply.
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
fairly
high
percentage
of
frivolous
in
the
prison
context,
but
i'm
not
sure
outside
of
the
prison
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
we
adopt
the
clear
and
convincing
rule
for
the
prison
context
and
not
elsewhere?
i
mean,
since
we
can
adopt
these
burden
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--proof
rules
willy
nilly,
can
we
just
do
it
for
the
prison
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr.
minear,
like
respondent's
counsel
you
are
not
proposing
a
rule
that
is
limited
to
prison
petitions,
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
even
if
we
had
all
those
statistics,
they
wouldn't
show
us
the
bottom
line
that
we
have
to
know,
would
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
just...
just
don't
allow
those
depositions,
as
opposing
counsel
suggests?
only
allow
the
government
to...
government
defendant
to
depose.
don't
allow
the
plaintiff.
