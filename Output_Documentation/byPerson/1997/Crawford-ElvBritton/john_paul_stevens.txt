justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
in
this
case,
what
would
happen
if
the
trial
judge
let
the
plaintiff
take
the
deposition
of
the
defendant
and
she
testified
that
she
merely
gave
the
materials
to
the
brother-in-law,
or
whatever
he
was,
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
she
knew
all
about
his
first
amendment
activities,
but
she
didn't
hold
a
grudge
against
him,
and
that's
all
she
said.
what
should
the
district
judge
do
with
the
case,
and
then
there's
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
there's
nothing
substantiating
it
except
his
belief
that
she
acted
improperly.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--that
may
be
her
belief,
but
she
may
say
with
respect
to
the
transactions
at
issue
in
this
case,
i
did
it
as...
purely
as
a
matter
of
convenience,
and
even
though
that's
my
belief,
i
wasn't
trying
to
discipline
him.
i
just
was
going
about
my
work.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
was
no
mistake.
what
she
did
with
his
papers
or
whatever
they
were,
nobody
fights
about
that.
that's
clear,
isn't
it,
the
facts?
actually
what
she
did
is
not
in
dispute,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
only
dispute
is
what
her
reason
for
doing
it
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
the
facts
are
that
she
intended
totally
to
deprive
him
of
his
papers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
though
she
merely
adopted
a
more
convenient
way
of
getting
them
delivered
to
their
destination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
namely,
sending
them
through
the
brother-in-law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
in
this
case,
one
of
the
concerns
is
the
burden
on
the
defendants
of
going
through
discovery.
how
extensive
is
the
discovery
that
you
think
you
need
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
need
anything
beyond
the
deposition
of
the
defendant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
true
that
harlow
dealt
with
the
special
problem
of
qualified
immunity,
and
your
position
in
this
case,
even
if
there's
no
qualified
immunity
defense
interposed,
you'd
still
make
the
same
arguments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
seems
to
me
the
case
really
is
about
the
merits,
because
if
the
defendant
here
did
what
was
alleged,
there
really
isn't
a
basis
for
qualified
immunity.
on
the
other
hand,
if
the
defendant
is
correct,
there's
no
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
she's
in
good
faith
there's
no
cause
of
action.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
do
you
not
agree
that
if
she
acted
in
good
faith
and
did
not
have
the
motive
that
the
plaintiff
describes,
there's
no
cause
of
action
at
all.
she
doesn't
need
an
affirmative
defense.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
don't
think
that's
right.
in
harlow
it's
even
if
they
acted
in
bad
faith
and
for
malice
and
all
these
other
bad
motives,
if
the
right
wasn't
clearly
established
at
the
time,
the
plaintiff
still
loses.
it's
not
a
question
of
subjective
good
faith.
it's
a
question
of
the
state
of
the
law
at
the
time
of
the
conduct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask,
is
the
rule
you're
advocating
limited
to
prison
cases,
or
would
it
apply
to
employee
discharge
cases?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
know
how
many
of
those
are
based
on
unconstitutional
motive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
also
not
proposing
a
rule
that's
limited
to
the
qualified
immunity
defense.
you're
proposing
a
rule
that
covers
all
unconstitutional
motive
affirmative
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
the
trial
judge
in
this
case
said,
the
law
was
perfectly
clear
at
the
time
of
action,
so
no
matter
what
happens
there's
no
qualified
immunity,
but
nevertheless
i'm
concerned
about
the
very
problem
you're
all
discussing
here?
would
they
have
just
said,
well,
since
the
qualified
immunity
defense
isn't
available,
well,
just
too
bad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
there
have
had
to
have
been
a
firm
basis
for
believing
they
had
the
intent
if
the...
in
order
for
the
plaintiff
to
make
out
the
affirmative
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
those
statistics
tell
us
how
many
of
those
cases
actually
went
to
trial?
justice
john
paul
stevens
about
3
percent,
so
that's
really
the
universe
we're
most
concerned
about,
the
3
percent.
