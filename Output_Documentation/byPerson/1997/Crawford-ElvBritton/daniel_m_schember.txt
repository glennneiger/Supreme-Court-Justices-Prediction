mr.
daniel
m.
schember
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
harlow
v.
fitzgerald,
a
first
amendment
retaliation
case,
the
court
held
that
district
courts
should
protect
defendants'
qualified
immunity
through
firm
application
of
the
civil
rules
protecting
defendants
against
the
burden
of
broad-ranging
discovery
and
enabling
them
promptly
to
seek
and
in
substantial
cases
promptly
to
obtain
summary
judgment.
the
federal
rules
are
fully
sufficient
to
accomplish
these
purposes.
at
the
outset
of
litigation
district
courts
can
hold
the
plaintiff's
discovery
in
abeyance
and
allow
defendants
to
inquire
of
the
plaintiffs,
obtaining
from
the
plaintiffs
all
evidence
that
they
have
to
support
their
contentions
that
they
exercised
first
amendment
rights,
that
the
defendants
knew
about
it,
that
the
defendants
injured
the
plaintiffs,
and
that
the
motive
for
the
injury
was
retaliation
for
exercise--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
no,
that's
the
question,
but
the
two
burdens
identified
in
harlow
are,
first,
the
burdens
of
trial
and
the
burdens
of
broad-ranging
discovery,
and
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
at
the
outset
of
the
case
the
district
court
through
firm
application
of
the
rules,
as
the
court
said
should
be
done
in
harlow,
can
protect
defendants
against
broad-ranging
discovery
and,
indeed,
impose
the
burden
on
the
plaintiff
to
come
forward
immediately
with
all
evidence
to
support
the
claim,
all
elements
of
the
claim,
and
if
the
plaintiff
is
unable
to
do
so
immediately,
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
summary
judgment
unless,
of
course,
the
plaintiff
can
show
specific
facts
giving
rise
to
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
discovery
will
uncover
necessary
evidence.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
and
i
think
guidance
from
this
court
could
tell
them
how
to
firmly
apply
the
civil
rules,
and
the
purpose
of
my
argument
is
to
suggest
precisely
what
should
be
said
in
that
regard,
and
that
by
holding
the
plaintiff's
discovery
in
abeyance
at
the
outset
of
the
case
until
the
defendant
has
been
entitled
to
discover
all
the
plaintiff's
evidence,
thereby
placing
the
defendant
in
the
position
of
promptly
seeking
summary
judgment
unless
the
plaintiff
has
sufficient
evidence
or
has
a
basis
for
seeking
discovery,
that
is
firm
control
that
prohibits
excessive
burden
on
the
defendant
at
the
outset.
and
even
if
the
plaintiffs
make
a
showing
that
there's
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
discovery
will
uncover
evidence
supporting
their
claims
the
district
court
still
could
hold
their
discovery
in
abeyance
if
the
defendant
wished
to
assert
a
defense
under
mount
healthy
board
of
education
v.
doyle,
saying
even
if
i...
we
were
substantially
motivated
by
hostility
to
the
plaintiff's
exercise
of
constitutional
rights,
nonetheless
we
would
have
taken
the
same
action
in
any
event,
and
if
defendants
come
forward
with
sufficient
evidence
to
establish
that
defense,
they
are
entitled
immediately
to
summary
judgment
on
that
ground
unless,
of
course,
plaintiff
immediately
can
present
admissible
evidence
rebutting
that,
or,
again,
make
a
showing
that
there
are
facts
giving
rise
to
a
reasonable
likelihood
that
discovery--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
certainly
the
harlow
court
commented
on
that
with
respect
to
the
subject
of
general
bad
faith
and
malice.
however,
inquiry
as
to
the
specific
intent
of
unconstitutional
animus
i
would
suggest
is
narrower.
for
example,
the
plaintiff
certainly
has
to
show
i
exercised
first
amendment
rights
and
the
defendant
knew
about
it,
and
discovery
as
to
that
inquiry
certainly
is
narrower
than
whether
the
defendant's
a
bad
person,
a
malicious
person,
someone
who
customarily
is
mean
to
people,
that
type
of
thing.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
the
court
certainly
said
that
qualified
immunity
is
to
be
based
upon
a
showing...
on
the
fact
that
a...
no
violation
of
clearly
established
law
exists,
but,
of
course,
retaliation
for
exercise
of
first
amendment
rights,
or
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
race
or
sex
was
clearly...
is
clearly
established
constitutional
law.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
but
justice--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--yes,
that
certainly
would
do
that,
but
that
would
be
effectively
the
end
of
claims
that
are
based
upon
the
subjective
intent
and,
if
we
are
to
eliminate
entirely
claims
that
are
based
upon
proving
the
unconstitutional
animus--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--general
malice,
but
harlow
cannot
be
read
for
the
proposition
that
first
amendment
retaliation
cases
cannot
go
forward,
period.
harlow
was
a
first
amendment
retaliation
case,
and
what
the
court
said
in
that
case
is,
firmly
apply
the
civil
rules
in
order
to
make
sure
that
there's
no
broad-ranging
discovery
and
to
make
sure
that
there's
early
determination
by
summary
judgment,
rather
than
a
long-delayed
trial
in
an
insubstantial
case.
it
cannot...
i
do
not
believe
harlow
can
be
read
to
foreclose
first
amendment
retaliation
cases,
and
it
has
not
been
understood,
i
don't
believe,
since
then,
to
stand
for
that
proposition.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
that
was
a
bivens
inquiry.
that
was
a
bivens
case
rather
than
a
section
1983
case,
but
yes,
the...
it
is
true
that
what
the
court
did
was
strip
away
the
particular
subjective
aspect
of
the
woodby-strickland
test.
that
part
of
the
test
didn't
make
any
sense.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
it
can't
always
be--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
i
suppose
it
can
always
be
asserted,
but
the
firm
application
of
the
rules
will
ferret
out
baseless
assertions
if
the
assertion
is
baseless.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
but
there
would
be...
the
motion
should
be
denied
for
the
following
reason.
implicit
in...
certainly
we
wouldn't
ignore
what
she
said
already
on
the
subject,
and
that
is
that
she
doesn't
think
prisoners
have
any
rights,
and
that
prisoners
bound
for
a
federal
penitentiary
don't
have
any
right
to
any
property
at
all,
and
that
is
not
a
reasonable
assertion,
the
idea
that
there
are
no
circumstances
in
which
any
federal
prisoner
has
any
right
to
possess
any
legal
papers,
no
matter
what
their
need
might
be
for
pending
litigation--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--is
not
a
reasonable--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--if
that
were
a
reasonable
belief,
then
in
theory
it
would
be
a
defense.
however,
it
is
not
a
reasonable
basis
for
her
to
have
so
acted.
in
waters
v.
churchill
the
court
talked
about
the
problem
of
inadvertent
or
mistaken
violation
of
first
amendment
rights
and
said
that
there
should
be
inquiry
as
to
whether
the
so-called
mistake
in
the
case...
or
the
genuine
mistake...
was
a
reasonable
mistake.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
no,
it's
not.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
and
implicit
in
her
reason,
certainly
the
facts
indicate
that
she
intended
to
deprive
him
totally
of
these
papers
and
all
of
his
property.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
her
belief
was
that,
supposedly
that
he
wasn't
entitled
to
have
them
at
all,
but
that
was
not
a
reasonable
belief.
that
is
not
a
proper
basis
for
a
mount
healthy
defense.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
it
was
her
belief...
no.
it
was
her
belief
that
the
prisoners
were
not...
in
the
federal
penitentiary
were
not
entitled
to
any
property
at
all.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that
was
unreasonable
belief.
she
diverted
it
outside
the
system
so
that
he
wouldn't
get
it.
she
said
to
mr.
carter,
i
don't
know
why
crawford-el's
so
upset
about
his
property.
i
should
just...
i
should
have
just
have
thrown
it
in
the
trash.
that's
what
she
said.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
the
plaintiff
has
to
have
admissible
evidence
that
proves
the
elements
of
the
case
and
yes,
if
it
does
come
down
to
a
question
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff
is
credible
in
assertings,
for
example,
a
defendant's
admission
that's
involved
here--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--then
yes,
it
does
come
down
to
that,
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
quite
unusual,
yes,
because
what
we
have
here
is
a
fairly
high-ranking
prison
official
dealing
directly
one-on-one
with
a
prisoner.
she
wasn't
a
prison
guard,
for
example,
and
yes,
it
is
rather
unusual
in
this--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--regard.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
because
here
there
is
admissible
evidence
proving
the
elements
of
the
claim,
including
defendant's
admissions
from
this
official
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
it's
undisputed
that
the
facts
of
the
case
state
a
violation
of
district
of
columbia
common
law,
not
that
i'm
suggesting
that
that
necessarily
bears
directly
on
the
question
of
the
availability
of
the
constitutional
cause
of
action,
but
it
certainly
bears
upon
the
reasonableness
of
the...
of
her
action.
this
is
an
instance
where
there
was
injury
inflicted.
out-of-pocket
loss
was
imposed,
and
it
happens
to
have
been
in
violation
of
the
district
of
columbia
common
law
and
also
there
is
sufficient
evidence
from
which
the
jury
could
find
that
unconstitutional
animus
motivated
it,
and
it
is
in
the
public
interest,
even
if
there
could
be
a
recovery
under
a
common
law
conversion
claim
that
the
first
amendment
claim
go
forward
and
that
the
plaintiff
be
allowed
to
prove
that
if
hostility
to
exercise
first
amendment
rights
was--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--he
can
prove
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
the
question
of
match,
i
don't
think
i'm
following--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--right.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
there
should
not
be,
i
am
arguing
to
the
court,
for
the
reasons
that
a
clear
and
convincing
evidence
rule
would
not
properly
balance
defendant's
needs
for
immunity
against
the
countervailing
interests,
which
are
the
need
to
deter
officials
from
violating
constitutional
rights,
and
the
need
to
redress
the
victims.
if
we
had
a
situation
where
government
employees
could
have
their
careers
ruined
by
supervisors
who
retaliate
against
them
for
their
exercise
of
speech
offduty
on
matters
of
public
concern,
the...
and
if
those
employees
were
not
able
to
obtain
any
redress
unless
they
could
prove
their
claims
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence,
the
chilling
effect
on
government
employees'
speech
would
be
contrary
to
the
public
interest.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
no.
well--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--what's
very
different
from
whether
you
should
hold
in
a
bivens
action
the
more
knowledgeable
official
liable
for
the
same
action
where,
because
that
official
is...
can
foresee
the
developments
in
constitutional
law,
whereas
an
official
who
takes
the
same
action
is
not
held
liable
because
he
or
she
cannot
foresee
developments
in
constitutional
law.
that--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--that
makes
sense.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
he
has
been
disciplined
is
the
hypothetical
there?
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that
seems
to
be
the
government's
hypothetical
at
page
19
of
their
brief,
and
it
seems
to
be...
the
united
states
amicus
brief.
that
example,
that
hypothetical
is
a
classic
example
of
circumstances
in
the...
in
which
the
defendant
would
promptly
obtain
summary
judgment
under
mount
healthy
board
of
education
v.
doyle,
could
certainly
prove
it.
even
if
i
had
that
motive
that
you
attribute
to
me
you
committed
a
disciplinary
violation,
and
we
punish
prisoners
who
commit
disciplinary
violations.
i
would
have
taken
the
same
action
in
any
event
under
the
existing
rules.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
oh,
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
the...
well,
but
the
plaintiff
has
to
come...
if
the
defendant
asserts
a
mount
healthy
defense
in
a
summary
judgment
motion.
the
plaintiff
can't
just
simply
say,
well,
i
think
you
had
a
different
intent.
the
plaintiff
would
have
to
come
forward
with
admissible
evidence
showing
that
the
official
would
not
have
done
the
same
thing
absent
the
intent.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
yes,
but
the
plaintiff
cannot
get
past
summary
judgment
merely
by
arguing
to
the
judge,
judge,
the
jury
may
disbelieve
the
defendant.
oh,
no.
under
the
summary
judgment
rules
the
plaintiff
has
to
come
forward
with
tangible,
admissible
evidence
creating
a
genuine
issue
for
trial
on
that,
and
mere
assertion
by
the
plaintiff
of,
i
don't
think
the
defendant
would
have
taken
the
action
but
for
hostility
to
me.
that's
not
enough.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
i
think
not.
no,
i
think
the
official
would
win
summary
judgment
under
that
hypothetical,
because
it's
very...
if
the
motive
was
to
get
the
property
back
to
the
prisoner
by
the
most
expeditious
means,
and
that
was
a
means
to
do
that,
and
that's
what
the
official
was
trying
to
do,
then
i
would
think
she
would
be
entitled
to
summary
judgment
on
it.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
and
those
aren't
the
facts
here.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
indeed
it
was
not,
and
that
was
not
her
intent.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
and...
well,
the
undisputed
facts
are
that
she
did
not
divert
the
property
outside
the
prison
system
for
the
purpose
of
getting
it
back
to
mr.
crawford-el.
it
was
to
divert
it
outside
the
prison
system
because
she
thought
he
didn't
have
any
entitlement
at
all
to
it,
and
that
she
could
have
thrown
it
in
the
trash,
and
as
an
alternative
to
throwing
it
in
the
trash,
she
allowed
a
relative
to
pick
it
up.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
that's
what
the
record
shows.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
if
the
defendant
raises
the
mount
healthy
defense
and
assumes
the
burden
of
presenting
evidence
from
which
the
jury
can
conclude
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
official
would
have
taken
the
same
action
in
any
event,
even
if
she
or
he
were
motivated
in
part
by
unconstitutional--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--that's
the
test.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
oh,
no.
if
the
defendant
provides,
in
a
mount
healthy
motion,
evidence
from
which
the
jury
can
conclude
that
she
would
have
acted
in
the
same
way
in
any
event,
if
the
plaintiff
doesn't
come
forward
with
evidence
rebutting
that...
and
it's
got
to
be
evidence,
not
surmise
and
guess.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
what...
here
you're
suggesting
that
there
was
a
dual
motive.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
what
i
said
was,
if
the
defendant
files
a
mount
healthy
motion
and
assumes
the
burden
of
saying,
i
would
have
acted
in
the
same
way,
even
though
i
was,
or
maybe
assumed
to
be...
to
have
acted
with
unconstitutional
animus,
if,
in
that
context,
the
defendant
raises
the
defense
and
presents
evidence
that
would...
that
from...
on
which
a
jury
could
reach
a
conclusion
that
the
defense
is
established,
then
the
plaintiff
must
come
forward.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
in
your
hypothetical,
your
honor,
the
claim
would
go
forward,
because
all
that's
been
shown
is
that
there
were
two
substantial
motivations
for
the
action,
and
the
defendant
has
not
gone
the
extra
step
of
saying,
even
though
there
was
this
motive,
or
irrespective
of
the
motive,
i
definitely
would
have,
in
any
event,
taken
the
same
action.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
the
mount
healthy
standard
is,
would
the
official
have
taken
the
same
action
anyway?
that's
the...
under
mount
healthy,
that's
what
the
official
has
to
show.
if
we
have
two
substantial
motivations,
it's...
and
one
is
unconstitutional
animus,
and
there's
no
proof
by
the
defendant
that
the
same
action
would,
in
fact,
have
been
taken
absent
the
unconstitutional
animus,
then
the
plaintiff
is
entitled
to
prevail.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
yes,
but
the
mount
healthy
defense,
the
defendant
would
say,
is,
i
would
have
taken
the
same
action
in
any
event,
as
in
the
discipline
hypothetical.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
oh,
unless
the
plaintiff
comes
forward
and
says,
now,
wait
a
minute,
other
people
committed
that
disciplinary
offense,
and
you
didn't
punish
them.
unless
the
plaintiff
comes
forward
with
something
tangible
that
says,
judge,
here
is
a
basis
in
fact
for
not
allowing
summary
judgment
to
a
defendant
who
says,
i
would
have
taken
the
same
action
for
the
following
reason--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--the
defendant
wins.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well,
yes,
but
that...
at
trial,
that's
true,
but
it
is
also
clear--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--well,
but
on
summary
judgment,
no,
a
plaintiff...
a
party
cannot
resist
summary
judgment
simply
by
saying
in
the
face
of
an
affidavit
from
the
other
side,
judge,
maybe
the
jury
won't
believe
this
affidavit.
oh,
no,
the--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--the
gravamen,
yes,
with
this
qualification.
yes,
i
recognize
that
there
is,
in
intent
cases,
some
degree
of
concern
similar
to
what
was
involved
in
harlow,
although
the
question
of
unconstitutional
intent
is
a
far
more
narrow
inquiry
than
general
subjective
ill-will.
my
argument
is
that
the
differences,
the
potential
burdens
that
are
presented
in
unconstitutional
intent
cases
are
not
so
great
that
the
balance
of
interests
overall
tips
in
favor
of
changing--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--the
rule,
because
the
federal
rules
can
be
applied
in
a
firm
way
to
substantially
reduce
the
burdens
that
might
otherwise
be
there.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
i
would
not
think
very
extensive.
there
are
certainly...
in
the
verified
complaint
there
are--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--yes.
there's
a
captain
in
seattle
i
think
we
need
to
depose.
there
is...
if
he
will
not
simply
cooperate
with
an
investigation.
there
are
some
prisoners
who
we
would
like
to
depose,
if
they're
not
available
simply
through
investigation,
but
in
terms
of
the
other
side,
in
terms
of
this
specific
claim,
no.
i
think
the
deposition
of
the
defendant
should
be
sufficient.
however,
one
of
the
issues
we'd
want
to
get
into
with
her
is
the
extent
of
her
role
in
deciding
which
prisoners
get
transferred
to
federal
penitentiaries,
because
it...
that
relates
to
her
belief
that,
well,
if
i
send
them
to
a
federal
penitentiary
they
won't
be
entitled
to
any
property,
and
i
think
that's
an
underlying
factor
that
we
may
want
to
look
into.
and
if
that
deposition
develops
specific
lines
of
inquiry
as
to
government
policy
on
that
subject,
then
i
think
maybe
a
couple
of
other
depositions
would
be
warranted,
but
no,
i
do
not
believe
extensive
discovery
would
be
required
in
this
case
for
this
claim.
now,
we
do
have
a
claim
against
d.c.
which
requires
a
custom,
policy,
and
practice
proof
as
well,
and
that's
not
before
the
court
now.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
well--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--hold
the
plaintiff's
discovery
in
abeyance
and
allow
the
defendant
to
do
discovery.
now,
certainly
under
the
rules
you
can
also
require
a
reply
from
the
defendant.
if
the
answer
to
the
complaint
raises
qualified
immunity,
there
could
be
a
reply
required.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
but
it
would
be
far
more
efficient,
rather
than
just
getting
more
assertions
from
the
plaintiff,
to
put
the
plaintiff
to
the
burden
of
producing
evidence,
and
that's
what
discovery
is
for.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
let
the
defendant
ask
the
questions
of
the
plaintiff,
or
send
interrogatories.
make
the
defendant...
make
the
plaintiff
produce
the
actual
evidence,
as
opposed
to
assertions,
so
that
way
we
can--
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
m.
schember
26.
rule
26
enables
the
court
to
limit
discovery
to
the
needs
of
the
case
and
to
prevent
undue
burden,
and
that
includes
controlling
the
timing,
the
methods,
and
the
means
of
discovery,
and
allowing
the
defendant
to
go
first
and
holding
the
plaintiff's
discovery
in
abeyance
goes
a
long
way
to
solving
this
problem.
