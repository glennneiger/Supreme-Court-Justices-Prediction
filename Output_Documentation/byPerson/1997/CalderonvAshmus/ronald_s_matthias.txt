mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
suit
was
initiated
by
a
california
death
row
inmate
to
prevent
state
officials
from
claiming
in
habeas
cases
that
california
is
a
chapter
154
qualifying
jurisdiction.
the
principal
issue
before
this
court
is
a
threshold
question.
that
question
is
whether
this
suit
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
or,
alternatively,
whether
it
qualifies
or
is
authorized
under
the
ex
parte
young
exception
to
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
as
a
declaratory
judgment?
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
there
is
a...
your
honor,
there
is
a
provision
of
california
law
for
declaratory
judgments.
i'm
not
intimately
familiar
with
the
provisions
of
that.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
the
state
courts
would
have
thought
themselves
to
be
an
appropriate
forum
for
entertaining
the
question
insofar
as
the
issue
of
154
compliance
or
not
only
has
significance
for--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--certainly
i'm
convinced
that
a
state
court
could
read
the
federal
statute,
interpret
it,
and
would
be
actually
in
a
better
position
to
understand
the
issue
at
least
insofar
as
the
154
compliance
question--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--it
does
make
some
sense.
it
also
makes
some
sense
to
allow
issues
to
percolate,
especially
an
issue
as
difficult
as
this
one
has
evidently
proved
for
many
federal
courts.
obviously
not
federal
courts
within
california,
because
in
fact
only
one
federal
court
has
been
allowed,
has
allowed
itself,
effectively,
to
consider
this
question,
but
i
certainly
don't
dispute
that
there
is
some
economy
in
somehow
aggregating
these
issues,
and
there
are
procedures
for
that.
your
honor's
suggestion
about
perhaps
going
to
state
court
at
least
on
some
of
the
subissues
that
will
turn
critically
on
questions
of
state--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--that,
too,
might
have
been
available.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
yes.
there
was
a
change
in
the
law
the
effect
of
which...
the
effective
date
of
which
is
january
1
of
this
year,
and
a
handful,
and
i
think
three
to
five
death
row
inmates
have
since
had
their
counsel
appointed
under
that
new
procedure
and,
theoretically,
when
they
finish
their
state
proceeding
in
however
many
years
that
takes,
and
they
then
move
to
federal
court
if
that
proves
necessary,
then
the
issue
of
chapter
154
compliance
at/or...
i
should
say,
the
issue
of
chapter
154
applicability
to
their
federal
habeas
proceedings
will
then
turn
on
what
we
call
the
new
law.
i
will
indicate,
though,
that
obviously
the
vast
majority
of
the
class
is
utterly
unaffected.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
no.
the
state
itself
was
never
named
as
a
defendant
formally.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
precisely.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
it's
two
wardens.
it's
the
warden
at
san
quentin,
where
the
men's
death
row
is
housed.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
to
my
knowledge
the
wardens
had
never
breathed
a
word
on
the
subject
of
154--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--no.
there
was
an
allegation
in
the
complaint,
i
think
generically,
and
i
think
the
theory
here
was
that
insofar
as
the
warden
calderon
and
warden
farmon
would
be
the
named
defendants
in
any
habeas
proceeding,
they
would
be
the
ones
who
would
be
urging
federal
courts
to
apply
chapter
154.
and
the
attorney
general
of
the
state
of
california,
approximately
1
year
before
the
aedpa
passed,
testified
before
the
senate
judiciary
committee
praised
the
aedpa
and
expressed
the
view
that
it
would
work
very
well
in
california
insofar
as
it
took
account
of
california's
unitary
review
procedure
where
collateral
claims
and
direct
appeal
claims
can
be
processed
at
or
about
the
same
time.
they're
on
a
roughly
parallel
temporal
track,
and
those
comments--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--yes.
the
attorney
general
himself
is
a
defendant
and
as
i
read
the
complaint
the
sole
wrongful
conduct
attributed
to
the
attorney
general
in
this
case
were
his
statements
to
the
senate
expressing
approval
of
the
aedpa
and
expressing
rather
optimistically
the
hope
that
it
would
work
well
in
california.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
well,
california
officials
certainly
spoke
to
the
issue
publicly.
we
had
precious
little
chance
to
actually
advocate
this
position
in
the
context
of
any
actual
pending
habeas
proceeding
because
mr.
ashmus
filed
his
lawsuit
about
4
hours
after
the
aed--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--no,
it's
not
maybe.
we
believe
firmly
that
we
have
qualified
under
the
provisions
of
chapter
154
since
june
of
1989.
we
have
since
that
time
regularly
appointed
counsel
to
represent
death
row
inmates--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--your
honor,
i
didn't
say
he
was
under
pressure.
i
was
simply
describing
what
the
allegation
was
in
the
petition.
what
was
the
alleged
wrongdoing--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--we
believe
we
have
complied,
and
i
think--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--that's
correct.
we
had
made...
there
had
been
state
officials
who
had
made
statements
to
the
media,
there
were
state
officials
who
had
testified
before
congress
and
expressed
the
view
that
we
had
complied.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
during
the
litigation
i
think
it
became
clear
that
the
plaintiffs
had
correctly
anticipated
our
position.
they
understood,
anticipated
that
we
would
take
the
position
that
we
are
a
chapter
154--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--that
appears
to
be
the
basis
for
this
lawsuit.
yes,
your
honor,
that
appears
to
be
the
basis
for
this
lawsuit,
and
i
frankly
don't
think
it
matters
whether
or
not
we
had
managed
to
somehow
get
ourselves
into
a
courtroom
and
assert
to
the
federal
district
court
judge,
your
honor,
we
believe
this
new
law
applies,
or
if
we
hadn't.
either
way,
our
role
in
federal
habeas
corpus
is
purely
adversarial.
it's
not
within
our
power
to
command
the
application
of
the
aedpa.
if
the
aedpa
would
be
applied
to
any
california
inmate
wrongly
because
we're
not
in
compliance,
that
would
be
a
federal
judicial
error,
if
it's
anything.
we
are
not
in
a
position
to
violate
the
aedpa.
the
aedpa,
and
chapter
154
in
particular,
does
not
impose
any
duties
on
state
officials--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--no,
i--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--i
don't
think
it
would
be
that,
your
honor,
but
i
think...
and
the
reason
i
responded
affirmatively
to
justice
o'connor's
question
is,
i
thought
we
both
understood,
and
it's
true
that
there
are
state
law
subquestions
lurking
in
the
aedpa.
in
order
to
qualify
under
the
aedpa,
state
law
provisions
must
be
of
a
certain
character.
the
state
must
have
done
certain
things.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
i
quite
agree,
although
there's
another
relevant
change
in
the
law,
a
very
recent
development
that
speaks
to
this
precise
question.
when
this
lawsuit
was
filed,
california
did
not
have
a
certified
question
procedure.
let
me
make
this
very
concrete.
one
of
the
questions,
one
of
the
subquestions
that
lurks
in
a
question
of
compliance,
is
a
state
in
compliance
or
not,
is
whether
or
not
a
state
has
a
rule
of
court
governing
the
appointment
of
counsel
and
standards.
now,
california
clearly
has
written
published
standards,
and
you
can
find
them
in
your
own
law
library,
i'm
confident,
clearly
has
had
that.
the
claim
of
the
inmates
was
that
that
did
not
have
the
dignity
of
a
rule
of
court
within
the
meaning
of
california
law.
that's
actually
not
that
easy
a
question,
because
there
are
many
things
that
go
by
that
label,
rule
of
court,
under
california
law,
and
the
district
court
quite
clearly
did
not
understand
that
and
applied
one
very
rigid
question
of
california
law,
one
very
rigid
definition,
the
most
limited
definition
possible.
now,
if
california
standards
for
the
employment
of
counsel
deserve
dignity
as
a
rule
of
law,
that's
a
state
law
question.
the
federal
courts
we
had
hoped
would
understand
that
and
correctly
construe
it,
but
in
this
case
that
failed.
i'm
just
using
this
as
one
example.
there
really
would
have
been...
when
this
lawsuit
was
filed
there
was
no
mechanism
for
the
federal
courts
to
turn
to
the
state
courts
in
california
and
effectively
ask
for
guidance
on
that
state
procedural
question.
fortunately,
that,
too,
has
changed,
and
although
the
district
court
would
not
today
have
any
mechanism
for
asking
for
guidance
on
a
certified
question
basis
from
the
district
court,
the
ninth
circuit
surely
would
have.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
surely,
your
honor.
go
ahead.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
there
are
many,
and
they
all
arise
in
the
context
of
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
itself.
it's
the
earliest
opportunity,
perhaps,
for
an
inmate
to
learn
whether
or
not
the
judge
before
whom
he
appears
with
his
habeas
proceedings,
it's...
the
earliest
opportunity
for
him
to
learn
whether
or
not
that
judge
is
of
the
mind
that
154
should
apply
is
probably
the
very
first
appearance
he
makes
in
that
court,
when
he
asks
for
the
appointment
of
federal
counsel
and
seeks
a
stay,
because
if
chapter
154
is
applicable
in
that
jurisdiction,
the
court's
authority
for
entering
that
stay
is
2262(a).
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
your
honor,
i'm
speaking
to
a
point
in
time
that
typically
precedes
the
actual
filing
of
a
petition
by
years.
i'm
talking
about
the
first
appearance
in
federal
court...
not
a
physical
appearance,
but
the
filing
of
a
document
that
requests...
state
proceedings
are
done,
you
turn
to
federal
court
and
you
say,
i
would
like
a
lawyer,
i
want
to
pursue
federal
habeas
corpus
review,
i
have
a
execution
date
pending,
and
i
would
like
that
stayed
for
the
purpose
of
appointing
a
lawyer,
the
procedure
that
this
court
essentially
described
in
mcfarland.
that
is
well
pre-petition,
well
pre-petition,
years.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
yes.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
the
procedure
in
the
northern
district
and
all
the
districts
of
california
is
that
the
request
for
appointment
of
counsel
gets
docketed,
it
gets
a
number,
it
gets
the
initials,
it
goes
to
a
court,
and
that
judge
almost
invariably
that
day
enters
the
stay,
signs
the
order,
and
the
search
for
a
lawyer
begins.
and
if
the
judge
is
going
to
enter
a
stay
in
a
death
penalty
case,
that
judge
must
at
that
point
in
the
procedure,
at
that
early
stage
must
ask
himself,
is
this
going
to
be
a
chapter
154
case,
or
is
this
going
to
be
a
chapter
153
case?
and
the
reason
the
judge
must
consider...
concern
himself
with
that
question
is
that
the
authority
for
entering
a
stay
in
a
jurisdiction
where
chapter
154
does
apply
is
2262.
the
judge
must
ask
himself,
what
am
i
staying,
and
what
is
my
authority
for
staying
it?
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
no.
he's
entitled
to
a
stay--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--no.
he's
entitled
to
stay--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--no.
he's
entitled
to
a
stay
whether
we
are
chapter
153
or
154.
the
difference
is--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--he
raises
that
claim
by
identifying
the
provision
of
law
under
which--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--the
judge
could
say
that.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
the
answer
is
no
other
action,
but
numerous
other
courses
of
conduct,
numerous
other
avenues
of
recourse.
one
would
be--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--one
would
be--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--one
would
be
asking
for
a
stay,
and
having
the
court
decide
whether
or
not
the
stay
is
pursuant
to
2262,
which
does
not
apply
unless
chapter
154
applies.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
he
could
ask...
he
could
ask
the
court
for
guidance
on
that,
and
the
judge
would
have
to
provide
it,
because
the
judge
is
required
to
determine
whether
chapter
154
applies
or
not,
because
if
it
does,
the
judge
is
statutorily
obligated
to
give
that
matter
priority,
so
the
federal
district
judge
must
concern
himself
with
this
question.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
i
quite
agree,
it
is
utterly
unessential
for
us
to
demonstrate
the
existence
of
these
other
opportunities.
i
was
simply
responding
to
the
concern
that
wouldn't
guidance
be
a
good
thing
early
on,
and
guidance
would
certainly
be
a
good
thing
early
on,
and
it's
manifestly
attainable
without
suing
state
officials
in
a
separate
cause
of
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
and
enjoining
them
from
ever
breathing
a
word
of
their
view
again
about
the
question
of
compliance.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
ex
parte
young
was
developed,
which
was
the
doctrine
that
was
ultimately
invoked
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
support
of
this
cause
of
action,
of
this
proceeding.
ex
parte
young
exists
to
harmonize
the
eleventh
amendment
with
the
well-recognized
importance
of
having
federal
courts
be
open
to
interpret
and
enforce
federal
rights
against
state
conduct
that
illegally
infringes
upon
it.
state
officials
do
not
act
illegally
by
expressing
a
legal
point
of
view
to
a
federal
district
court
on
a
question
that's
in
dispute.
that's
not
an
illegal
act.
at
worst,
it's
mistaken.
at
worst,
it's
that.
but
that's
the
question
that
the
suit
was
designed
to
resolve,
whether
or
not
it's...
who's
right
or
who's
wrong.
the
aedpa
is
not
something
that
state
officials
have
any
capacity
to
violate
one
way
or
the
other.
it's
a
reform
measure.
it's
not
directed
to
us.
it's
directed
to
inmates,
primarily,
and
secondarily
it's
directed
to
the
conduct
of
federal
district
courts
and
federal
courts
of
appeal.
we're
not
in
the...
it
imposes
no
duty
on
us.
it
establishes
no
prohibitions
that
we
can
fail
to
heed.
the
most
we
can
do
on
this
question
of
aedpa
applicability,
chapter
154
applicability
in
particular,
the
absolute
most
we
can
do
is
explain
to
a
federal
court
what
our
view
of
its
applicability
is
and
why.
if
there's
going
to
be
a
violation
of
its
provisions,
which
would
be
their
application
to
a
situation
where
the
law
would
not
have
them
applicable,
that
would
be
judicial
error.
that's
the
sort
of
thing
you
take
care
of
by
an
appeal,
if
you
feel
aggrieved
by
a
ruling
by
a
district
court
that
you
think
is
wrong.
not
illegal.
the
district
court
is
not
in
a
position
to
act
illegally
by
erring.
that's
just
pure
judicial
error,
if
it's
anything.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
it
is
not
here.
that
draconian
choice
does
not
exist.
that
hobson's
choice,
that
dilemma
that
you
see
referred
to
in
the
respondent's
brief,
does
not
exist.
this
lawsuit
is
not
a
way
out
from
a
bind.
if
any
inmate
in
california
wants
guidance
on
the
question,
will
i
or
will
i
not
be
held
to
the
time
lines
of
chapter
154
or
any
other
provision
of
the
aedpa,
for
that
matter,
all
he
need
do
is
ask
the
judge,
and
mr.
ashmus
knows
this
first-hand.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
the
judge
must
concern
himself
with
that
question.
he
must
concern
himself
with
that
question
at
the
threshold
the
first
time
he
meets
that--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--because
it's
a
different
provision
of
law
that
will
authorize--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--i
think
the
judge
would
more
than
likely
want
to
inform
himself
not
only
what
is
the
authority
for
the
stay,
and
i
realize
it
could
be
one
of
two
places,
he
would
also
need
to
inform
himself
whether
the
entire
proceeding
is
one
which
he
will
be
statutorily
required
to--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--it
won't
change.
the
question
whether
a
particular
proceeding
will
be
conducted
under
154
or
153
will
not
change
as
a
result
of
changes
in
the
law
that
occur
after
you
get
into
federal
court,
because
chapter
154
looks
to
the
mechanism
that
was
in
place--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--well,
you
get
into
federal
court
under
mcfarland
for
the
purpose
of
asking
for
a
lawyer
and
getting
a
stay.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
well,
that
may
not
be
the
purpose,
but
that's
the
effect,
because
if
the
judge
grants
the
stay,
the
judge
must
concern
himself
with
his
statutory
authority
for
entering
such
a
stay,
and
the
source
of
that
authority
will
differ,
depending
on
whether
it's
153
or
154.
the
judge
must
also
concern
himself--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--it
does,
because
the
judge
will
have
read
the
statute
and
will
understand
that
the
minute
that
petition
is
filed
he's
obligated
to
treat
it
with
priority
over
all
other
noncapital
matters.
the
judge
must
concern
himself,
and
i
think
it's
inconceivable
that
a
court
would
concern
itself
with
that
question
and
indulge
in
case
management
process
and
somehow
keep
it
a
secret
from
the
inmate,
and--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--i
can't
tell
you
why
the
ninth
circuit
did
not
take
stock
of
the
fact
that
there
are
many
mechanisms
for
determining
that
short
of
a
separate
lawsuit.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
you
could
simply
file
a
motion.
when
attorneys
are
in
federal
court
they
get
extensions
of
time
to
file
the
petition,
and
stays
of
execution
in
connection
with
their
efforts
to
get
more
time
to
file
a
petition.
if
we're
talking
about
a
due
date
it
wouldn't
make
any
sense
to
discuss
that
between
and
among
the
parties
without
some
sense
of
what
the
controlling
law
would
be.
you
don't
need
to
confront
this
at
the
last
minute.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
well,
that's
right,
except
mr.
ashmus
knows
very
well
that
it's
entirely
possible
to
go
to
your
federal
district
court
judge
with
questions,
uncertainties
that
you
have
about
the
application
of
aedpa,
and
you
get
lickety-split
answers.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
no.
as...
i
suspect
strongly
your
honor
is
exactly
correct.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
then
he
gets
the
benefit,
the
inmate
knows
that
he
will
not
be
held
to
154,
we
express
our
objections,
and
that
will
become
an
issue
that
will
be
reviewed
in
due
course.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
well,
it
may
still
turn
out--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--we
are
enormously
interested--
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
--your
honor,
i
assure
you
the
state
is
enormously
interested
in
attaining
resolution
of
this
question.
we
are
simply
not
interested
in
being
sued
under
circumstances
where
we
are
immune
in
order
to
attain
resolution
to
that
question.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
it
certainly
would
have
been...
it
would
have
made
enormous
sense
to
insist
up
on
no
injunction,
because
that's
preposterous
and
unprecedented.
mr.
ronald
s.
matthias
my
only
response
to
that
is,
i...
to
the
extent
that
there
is
an
insoluble
dilemma
created
by
the
aedpa,
and
i
don't
believe
it's
at
all
insoluble,
but
to
the
extent
it
is
troubling
and
the
stakes
are
indisputably
high,
that
is
a
function
of
the
aedpa
itself,
not
what
state
officials
say
about
the
aedpa.
