unknown
speaker
mr.
matthias,
do
you
think
this
suit
could
have
been
brought
as
a
class
action
in
a
state
court
in
california?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
just
wondering
what
the
alternatives
might
have
been.
you're
objecting
because
the
suit
was
filed
in
federal
court,
but
presumably
had
it
been
filed
this
same
kind
of
issue
and
demand
in
state
court,
it
would
be
all
right
as
far
as
you're
concerned.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
state
court
can
decide
that
just
as
well
as
a
federal
court,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
as
a
practical
matter
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
to
have
the
whole
issue
resolved
and
not
do
it
case-by-case
in
every
separate
federal
habeas
petition
that's
filed.
i
mean,
that
makes
some
sense,
i
would
think,
from
the
standpoint
of
the
state
as
well
as
the
defendants.
unknown
speaker
not
just
the
subissues,
the
whole
thing.
unknown
speaker
did...
has
california
complied...
by
the
way,
has
california
adopted
a
statute
in
the
interim,
since
we
took
this--
unknown
speaker
--now,
you're
arguing,
mr.
matthias,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
bars
this
proceeding.
there
are
a
number
of
state
officials
joined.
was
the
state
of
california
also
joined?
unknown
speaker
and
so
you're
arguing
this
is
not
an
appropriate
ex
parte
young
situation,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
and
who
were
the
state
officials
who
were
joined?
unknown
speaker
were
the
wardens
going
around
making
contentions
about
what
california
had
done
by
way
of
providing
counsel?
unknown
speaker
was
there
an
allegation
in
the
complaint
that
the
wardens
had
made
these
contentions?
unknown
speaker
and
he's
a
defendant,
the
attorney
general's
a
defendant?
unknown
speaker
are
you
suggesting
by
what
you
just
said
that
california's
position
really
is
kind
of
iffy,
non-final
on
this
matter
of
whether
the
state
complies
with
154,
because
i
thought
that
the
lawsuit
was
premised
on
the
idea
that
california
has
said
yes,
we
make
it,
we
fit
under
154,
but
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
something
that
would...
doesn't
even
get
us
to
something
fancy
like
the
eleventh
amendment,
that
california
really
hasn't
taken
a
firm
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
california's
position
right
now,
yes
we
fit,
or
maybe
we
fit,
we
hope
we
fit?
unknown
speaker
so
now
you're
backing
off
from
what
you
said
before.
it
was
suggested
to
me
that
you
were
saying,
it's
still
iffy,
he
just
made
that
one
statement
or
two
statements,
and
he
was
under
pressure
and
all
that,
so--
unknown
speaker
--but
now
you
say,
forget
all
that,
yes
we
have
crossed
swords
here,
we
are
saying
we've
made
a
final
decision,
we
comply,
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
you've
complied,
but
you
didn't
say
you
had
complied
earlier.
you're
saying
at
the
time
this
complaint
was
filed
there
was
no...
no
evidence
that
you
had...
that
the
state
had
taken
a
firm
position
we
were
in
compliance.
unknown
speaker
so
when
did
you
join
issue
on
this
point?
unknown
speaker
so
a
plaintiff
is
predicting
what
a
defense
would
be,
and
then
the
defendant
says,
yes,
that's
our
defense,
and
that's
the
basis
for
a
lawsuit?
unknown
speaker
it's
to
be
applied
by
federal
courts,
which
is
why
i'm
not
sure
that
there
could
have
been
a
declaratory
judgment
in
state
court.
what
would
the
state
courts
declare,
that
federal
courts
must
follow
the
aedpa?
i
don't
think
state--
unknown
speaker
--courts
would
give
that
kind
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
unknown
speaker
but
unless
california
has
a
very
unusual
declaratory
judgment
procedure,
you
usually
declare
the
existence
of
nonexistence
of
a
certain
right.
you
just
don't
come
in
and
say,
i
want
an
abstract
interpretation
of
this
subproposition
of
law,
am
i
right
or
wrong
about
it.
i
mean,
you
usually
say
you're
entitled
to
this
or
you're
not
entitled
to
this.
unknown
speaker
can...
i
see
that.
are
you
finished
with
that,
because
i've
one
question
only
that
i'd
like
to
ask,
if
you're
finished.
unknown
speaker
what
in
your
opinion
is
the
right
route?
that
is
to
say,
i
believe
that
you
think
the
state
of
california
thinks
it
has
complied
with
the
counsel
requirements
in
aedpa,
and
a
group
of
prisoners
on
death
row
think
they
have
not.
and
so
what
the
group
of
prisoners
says
is,
if
we
file
our
first
habeas
within
180
days,
we
can't
complain
about
the
statute
because
we
complied
with
it,
and
if
we
wait
until
after
180
days,
and
it
turns
out
we're
wrong,
we
are
literally
without
a
remedy
to
complain
about
being
sentenced
to
death.
now,
that
seems
a
terrible
dilemma
to
be
in,
and
that's
why
they
filed
this
lawsuit,
and
i
want
to
know,
in
your
opinion,
are
they
without
any
remedy,
or
if
they
have
a
remedy
to
test
out
the
situation
in
advance,
so
they
don't
get
into
that
dilemma,
specifically,
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
but
there's
a
problem
with
that,
because
he
has
to
file
the
petition
in
order
to
see
the
judge,
and
i
thought
that
the
problem
was
how
much
time
does
he
have
to
file
the
petition.
if
it's
154,
half
the
time,
or
something
like
that.
unknown
speaker
but
is
the
applicant
going
to...
is
he
going
to
know
any
particular
judge
at
that
point?
unknown
speaker
he
would
be
dealing
with
a--
unknown
speaker
--so
does
the
death
row
prisoner
argue,
i
want
the
stay,
and
i'm
entitled
to
a
stay
only
if
california
has
not
complied
with
these
legal
requirements?
unknown
speaker
he's
entitled
to
a
stay
only
if
your
position
on
the
merits
is
wrong.
unknown
speaker
only
if
it's
right.
unknown
speaker
i'm
saying,
how
does
he
get
to
raise
his
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
said
the
judge
would
say
it
doesn't
matter.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
what
he's
trying
to
do
is
to
require
a
court
to
say
that
he's
right
about
california's
not
complying
and
california
thinks
he's
wrong,
and
my
question
is,
although
this
is
a
very
unusual
action,
what
other
kind
of
action
could
be
bring
to
get
that
raised,
and
the
answer
may
be
none,
but
i
want
to
know
what
you
think
about
that.
unknown
speaker
let's
get
one.
let's
get
one--
unknown
speaker
--because
the
first
one
i'm
not
too
happy
with.
unknown
speaker
okay.
is
there
another
one?
let's
try
another
one.
unknown
speaker
is
it
essential
to
your
case
to
show
that
there
was
some
other
way
for
these
people
to
get
an
advanced
declaration
of
what
their
rights
were?
i
mean,
many
litigants
are
faced
with
the
problem,
is
my
cause
barred
under
a
2-year
statute
of
limitation,
under
a
3-year
statute
of
limitation,
and
ordinarily
the
cautious
ones
will
take
the
2-year
statute
of
limitations.
unknown
speaker
a
lot
of
the
questions
from
the
bench
up
to
now,
and
the...
your
argument
have
been
devoted
to
the
second
question
presented,
is
this
a
proper
injunction,
but
you
also
contend
it's
a
violation
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
could
you
state
briefly
what
the
basis
for
that
contention
is?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
right
on
that.
the
thing
that...
i
think
the
thing
that's
bothering
me
that
makes
this
a
serious
case
is
this.
ex
parte
young
essentially
had
i
think
two
justifications,
and
they
did
not
have
to
be
separated
in
ex
parte
young.
in
the
first
place,
there
was
the
threat
in
effect
of
the
imposition
or
the
threat
of
the...
an
illegal
restriction
upon
the
imposition
of
a
tax,
so
that
if
it
was
an
improper
restriction,
the
state
officials
were
acting
illegally.
secondly,
there
was
what
the
court
described
as
rather
a
fear
of
draconian
consequences
if
an
ex
parte
young
proceeding
could
not
be
brought
because,
in
fact,
if
it
should
turn
out
that
those
who
wanted
to
protest
the
state
restriction
were
wrong,
the
consequences,
the
exactions
that
the
state
would
then
be
entitled
to
would
virtually,
economically
would
destroy
the
person
who
had
objected.
the
stakes,
to
put
it
crudely,
were
too
high
for
normal
litigation.
what
we've
got
here,
arguably,
is
half
of
ex
parte
young.
you're
entirely
right,
we
don't
have
the
kind
of
threatened
illegal
action
that
ex
parte
young
was
talking
about.
but
as
justice
breyer's
question
indicated,
there
does
seem
to
be
an
argument
that
if
in
fact
the
prisoner
who
claims
that
the
state
is
not
in
compliance,
that
that
prisoner
either
has
to
play
it
safe
and
act
in
accordance
with
a
shorter
period,
or
the
prisoner
has
to
take
an
awful
risk,
because
if
the
prisoner
is
wrong,
the
prisoner,
in
effect,
will
be
executed
without
the
benefit
of
federal
process.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
arguably
half
of
ex
parte
young
is
here,
and
the
question
is,
to
me
is,
is
that
enough?
i
will
agree
with
you
that
the
other
half
seems
to
be
missing,
but
is
the
draconian
consequence
half
here,
and
is
that
enough
for
us
to
say
ex
parte
young
should
apply?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
judge
says,
look,
i'm
not
here
giving
you
advisory
opinions.
i'm
just
going
to
appoint
counsel
for
you
and
you'll
have
to
worry
about
your
time
limits.
the
judge
can
perfectly
well
respond
that
way,
can't
he?
unknown
speaker
tell
me...
that's
the
point
that
i
think
i'm
not
getting.
why
does
he
have
to
concern
himself
with
it
at
the
threshold?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
as
justice
breyer
said,
he
says,
look,
i'll
appoint
him
under
this
section
or
that
section.
i'm
still
going
to
make
an
appointment.
i
mean,
that
would
be
open
to
the
judge,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
wouldn't
it
be
premature
for
the...
i
mean,
the
one
thing
he
has
to
do,
whether
it's
153
or
154,
is
appoint
a
lawyer,
and
you
said
this
could
happen
years
before
the
actual
petition
is
filed,
so
why
would
a
judge
want
to
make
a
determination
at
that
threshold
state
that
might
well
be
different
down
the
road
when
the
petition
is
actually
filed?
i
mean,
you
just
pointed
out
that
california
has
passed
new
legislation
and
everything.
why--
unknown
speaker
--you
say...
but
when
is
getting
into
federal
court?
is
it
when
you
file
the
application
for
the
stay
of
execution,
or
when
you
file
the
habeas
petition?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
not
for
the
purpose
of
making
a
determination
whether
it's
153
or
154.
unknown
speaker
but
it...
for
the
purpose
of
what
the
judge
is
doing
at
the
moment,
does
it
make
any
difference...
does
it
have
anything
to
do
with
what
counsel
he
can
appoint,
how
much
that
counsel
will
be
paid,
whether
at
that
point
he
says
153
or
154?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
was
all
so
clear,
why
didn't
the
district
judge
and
the
ninth
circuit
just
tell
us
that?
they
said
this...
this
is
a
nonissue,
because
the
minute
he
files
for
the
say
of
execution
the
judge,
district
judge
is
going
to
put
a
stamp,
153
or
154
on
it.
unknown
speaker
what's
another
one?
you've
given
us
one.
what's
another?
unknown
speaker
but
ordinarily,
you
know,
if
you're
going
to
get
a
ruling
from
a
district
court
you
ordinarily
would
have
one
party
actually
present,
the
other
party
present.
to
simply
kind
of
casually
ask
a
judge,
you
know,
what's
the
law
in
this
case,
i
think
most
judges
would
tell
you,
well,
you
know,
you
brief
me.
i'm
not
going
to
brief
you.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
may
i
just
go...
you
never
completed
your
answer
to
justice
breyer
as
far
as
i
was
concerned,
because
you
gave
the
example
if
he
thinks
134
applies,
or
154
applies
then
he'll
act
pursuant
to
2262,
grant
the
stay,
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
me
most
judges
in
the
ninth
circuit,
district
judges
are
probably
going
to
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
on
the
ultimate
issue,
and
that
153
applies,
just
as
a
practical
matter,
even
if
we
vacate
the
decision.
unknown
speaker
but
then
what
happens
if
the
judge
thinks,
well,
i'll
follow
153,
when
he
comes
in
and
asks
for
a
lawyer
and
a
stay?
unknown
speaker
and--
--but
in
due
course
it
may
turn
out
the
inmate's
wrong--
--he's
wrong--
--and
end
of
line.
that's
the
dilemma.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
just
backed
yourself
into
it.
there
is
a
problem,
and
i
would
think
that
california
would
be
as
interested
as
the
prisoners
in
knowing
whether
or
not
it
is
correct
that
california
has
a
unitary
procedure
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
and
much
of
that's
going
to
be
determined
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
which
is
why
i
asked
you
in
the
first
place
whether
they
couldn't
go
into
state
court
and
determine
whether
there
are
state
laws
that
establish
what
is
required
for
a
unitary
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you,
suppose
you
had
conferred
in
the
office
of
the
attorney
general
and
you
said,
you
know,
this
suit
is
a
vehicle
for
us
to
get
a
quick
answer.
we'll
know
one
way
or
the
other.
we'll
know
if
we
have
to
adopt
a
special
rule
or
statute,
so
we'll
accept
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court,
but
we
don't
want
an
injunction.
would
that
have
made
any
sense?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
then
what
good
would
the
class
action
have
done
without
the
injunction,
because
then
these
petitioners
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
if
they
hadn't
filed
a
class
action
at
all.
they
still
have
to
look
at
their
calendar
and
file
their
petitions,
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
matthias.
mr.
laurence,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
difference
between
unlawfully
and
illegally?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
really
right.
it's
only
been
used
to
enjoin
some
kind
of
continuing
violation
of
federal
law
and
as
i
understood
this
new
federal
procedure,
the
state
isn't
obliged
to
opt
for
a
unitary
review
procedure.
it's
an
option
open
to
a
state
that
meets
certain
requirements,
and
california
now
has
passed
a
statute
apparently
trying
to
opt
in,
but
it
doesn't
violate
the
law
by
not
doing
so,
or
by
taking
a
position
on
whether
it
wants
to
or
doesn't
want
to.
i
mean,
that's
just
the
strangest
complaint
that
you've
made.
unknown
speaker
no,
the
state
does
not
have
to
try
to
opt
in
to
unitary
review.
it's
an
option
open
to
the
state.
unknown
speaker
but
your
injunction
that
you
obtained
in
the
district
court
prohibits
the
state
from
taking
the
position
that
154
applies,
and
the
state
says,
it
seems
to
me
with
considerable
justification,
that
there
is
nothing
illegal
about
our
arguing
the
position,
and
you
have
therefore
taken
away
one
of
the
principal
threshold
primary
tests
for
ex
parte
young.
the
state
is
doing
nothing
illegal
in
arguing
a
position.
unknown
speaker
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
state's
position,
the
state
violating
the
law.
so
it
put
these
death
row
inmates
to
their
option,
but
that
doesn't...
the
state
has
a
perfect
right,
i
would
think,
to
make
an
argument
that
thus-and-such
is
so.
if
it's
wrong,
it
will
be
told
so,
but
to
make
an
argument
of
law
that
ultimately
turns
out
to
be
incorrect
surely
is
not
violating
the
law.
the
district
court...
you
know,
a
lot
of
mumbojumbo
doesn't
change
that.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
laurence,
i
take
it
from
what
you
said
about
the
declaratory
judgment
that
nothing
really
turns
on
california's
bragging
or...
that
the
defendants
on
death
row
would
be
in
precisely
the
same
position
if
the
california
attorney
general
didn't
speak
one
word,
as
long
as
there
was
a
realistic
suspicion
that
california
might
take
this
position.
suppose
somebody
in
the
ag's
office
said,
yeah,
we
might
take
that
position.
i
don't
see
where
you
have
made
a
lawsuit
on
the
basis
of
what
the
attorney
general
said
he
would
do
any...
i
don't
see
that
your
case
is
any
stronger
than
it
would
be
if
all
there
was
was
a
suggestion
that
california
might
make
such
a
claim.
if
your
death
row
inmate
is
differently
situated
in
those
cases,
explain
to
me
why.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
every
death
row
inmate
in
every
state
in
the
country
could
come
in
and
say,
district
court,
give
us
the
assurance
that
when
we
file
our
petition
it
will
be
under
153
and
not
154.
nothing
peculiar
to
california
and
the
attorney
general
having
acted
in
a
certain
way.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
not
even
getting
up
to
ex
parte
young.
i'm
getting
up
to,
do
we
have
a
case
or
controversy
fit
for
federal
adjudication?
looked
at
one
way,
this
is
a
plaintiff
coming
in
and
saying,
federal
court,
please
knock
out
what
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
to
my
habeas
case.
ordinarily,
you
simply
can't
go
to
a
court
and
say
now,
i've
got
this
lawsuit,
but
there's
a
defense
in
it,
and
i'd
like
to
have
a
separate
lawsuit
about
that
defense
to
knock
out
that
defense,
and
then
i'll
come
in
with
my
lawsuit.
that
in
any
other
context
would
be
unimaginable,
that
a
plaintiff
could
come
in
with
a
lawsuit
and
say,
but
i've
got
a
threshold
lawsuit
which
will
be
to
knock
out
this
affirmative
defense,
and
then
we
can
have
a
nice
clean
lawsuit,
without
that
defense.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
cannot
waive
the
presence
of
an
actual
case
or
controversy
within
article
iii.
nobody
can
waive
that.
unknown
speaker
we're
obliged
to
raise
that
on
our
own.
you
can
raise
standing.
and
that's
what
i'm
raising.
this,
i
thing
you'll
agree
with
me,
is
a
plaintiff
saying,
i
am
a
potential
habeas
petitioner.
in
my
habeas
case,
i
don't
want
them
to
raise
that
defense,
because
it
will
be
literally
death
for
me,
so
i
want
an
anticipatory
suit
to
get
rid
of
what
would
be
an
affirmative
defense
in
my
full-blown
lawsuit.
i
don't
know
of
any
other
situation
like
this.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
12(b)(6)
question.
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--way
short
of
that.
i'm
really
asking,
do
we
have
a
justiciable
case
or
controversy
under
article
iii
when
a
plaintiff
comes
to
court
and
says,
before
i
bring
my
complaint,
please
knock
out
an
affirmative
defense.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
declaratory
judgment
is
a
remedy.
it
isn't...
doesn't
create
jurisdiction
that
wouldn't
exist
otherwise.
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
any
other
instance
in
which
someone
has
gotten
a
declaratory
judgment
on
just
an
abstract
issue
of
law,
whether
153
or
154
applies,
as
opposed
to
whether
i
am
entitled
to
occupy
this
property,
or
whether,
you
know,
a
particular
right...
this
is
no
adjudication
of
any
right
of
your
clients
at
all,
whether
they're
entitled
to
get
out
of
prison,
whether
they're...
you
know,
it's
just
a
declaratory
judgment
for
a
declaration
about
an
abstract
proposition
of
law.
i
didn't
know
you
could
use
declaratory
judgment
for
that.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
had
to
have
a
cause
of
action.
maybe
it
was
a
little
early
that
you're
asserting
it,
but
you
have
to
be
making
a
claim
of
right.
unknown
speaker
--not
claim
of
right.
you're
claiming
that...
as
justice
ginsburg
said,
you're
raising
an
anticipatory
defense
and
saying
that
defense
is
invalid.
that's
not
a
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
laurence,
supposing
in
a
somewhat
different
context
you
have
a
claim
that
you
want
to
bring
under
1983,
some
sort
of
a
civil
rights
claim,
but
you're
not
ready
to
bring
the
claim
yet,
and
you're
worried
which
statute
of
limitations,
which
state
statute
of
limitations
will
the
federal
court
apply
to
your
case.
do
you
think
you
can
go
in
and
say,
i'm
not
ready
to
file
yet,
i
just
want
to
know
what
statute
of
limitations
is
going
to
apply?
unknown
speaker
why
should
it
be
different
here?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
problems
are...
certainly
that
doesn't
make
it
any
easier
for
you.
it
makes
it
harder.
unknown
speaker
mr.
laurence,
is
it
clear
that
the
application
of
the
statute
of
limitations
depends,
as
you
say,
upon
the
assertion
of
a
defense
by
the
state?
suppose
california
comes
in
and
says,
we
don't
qualify
for
154
treatment,
whereas
they
plainly
do.
do
you
think
a
federal
court
can
ignore
154?
unknown
speaker
and
say,
because
california
wants
to
do
it
the
old
way,
and
they
like
these
lengthy
procedures,
we're
going
to
subject
the
federal
court
to
these
lengthy
procedures?
does
it
make
any
difference
whether
california
asserts
it
or
not?
unknown
speaker
if
the
state
qualifies,
not
if
the
state
asserts
that
it
qualifies.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'll
be
darned
if
i'm
going
to
let
a
state
make
the
federal
process
more
cumbersome
than
congress
has
said
just
because
it
chooses
to.
you
don't
think
a
federal
court
is
going
to
allow
that,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i...
we
know
the
substantive
part,
but
i'm
having
the
same
problem.
i
don't...
and
i
think
your
case
turns
on
this.
i
don't
see
any
need
for
an
injunction
here
if
you
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment.
after
all,
you
get
a
declaratory
judgment,
appeal
that,
you'll
get
an
authoritative
ruling,
but
what
right
do
you
have
to
a
declaratory
judgment?
now,
you
must
have
read
about
declaratory
judgments
in
preparation
for
this.
everybody's
asking
you
i
think
the
same
question.
can
you
find
any
analogy
at
all...
i
mean,
i
can
be
helpful,
i
think.
i
know
that
you
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
against
the
state
where
the
state's
threatening
to
do
something
bad
to
you.
i
know
you
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
against
the
state
where
the
state's
threatening
to
bring
a
lawsuit
against
you
and
there's
good
reason
for
proceeding
first.
i
know
you
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
about
a
defense
if
they
think
almost
certainly
the
thing's
going
to
be
raised
and
there's
very
good
reason,
you
know,
for
finding
out
the
defense
first.
so
you've
read
those
cases.
i
haven't.
what's
your
best
way
of
saying,
even
if
there's
nothing
right
on
point,
we
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
here
even
though
it's
about
a
defense
likely
to
be
brought
in
a
lawsuit
called
habeas
corpus
that
i,
who
want
the
declaratory
judgment,
are
going
to
bring?
unknown
speaker
but
there
the
people
had
been
arrested
and
the
threat
was
to
continue
the
arrests.
it
wasn't
just
taking
a
position
on
some
legal
point.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was...
they
proved
a
continuing
threat
of
arrest,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
take
action
of
arresting
them.
unknown
speaker
but
if...
cases
like
great
lakes
v.
huffman
and
others
say
that
you
have
to
comply
with
virtually
the
same
requirements
to
get
a
declaratory
judgment
that
you
have
to
comply
with
to
get
an
injunction,
so
it's
not
as
if
you
can
avoid
the
principles
of
injunctive
law
on
the
merits
by
saying
all
i
want
is
a
declaratory
judgment.
you
have
to
make
a
showing
there,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
wouldn't
be
so
much
of
a
declaratory
judgment.
that
would
simply
be
a
ruling
on
the
habeas
petition
that
it
was
timely
filed.
you
know,
in
that
sense
you
can
say
that
any
number
of
rulings
are
declaratory
judgments.
i
don't
think
the
state
concedes
that
a
separate
declaratory
judgment
would
be
proper.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that
point,
because
it
seems
to
me
if
they
bring
it,
say,
after
180
days
the
judge
makes
a
ruling
of
law
in
that
case.
they
don't
have
to
label
it
a
declaratory
judgment
or
anything.
this
is...
how
is
it
any
different
from
a
defendant
pleads
statute
of
limitations,
the
judge
rules
on
that
affirmative
defense
and
rejects
it?
why
do
you
label
that
declaratory
judgment?
it's
just
a
ruling
on
the
timeliness
of
the
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
but
the
problem
is...
you
gave
us
steffel
v.
thompson,
where
i
suppose
the
defendant...
the
petitioner
is
trying
to
ward
off
the
state
instituting
criminal
proceedings
against
him.
wasn't
that
it?
unknown
speaker
right.
so
that
has
all
the
feel
of
a
concrete...
i
mean,
he
said,
i've
done
it,
they
told
they're
going
to
arrest
me,
i'm
going
to
do
it
again,
they're
going
to
arrest
me
again.
but
here
we
just...
we
have
an...
a
question
abstracted
from
a
controversy
down
the
road,
and
i
think
there
are
all
kinds
of
courts
in
the
world,
even
in
some
states
that
can
say,
this
is
what
the
law
means,
but
the
federal
courts
don't
have
that
kind
of
authority.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
true...
what
you're
saying
now
is
true
of
every
person
in
every
state
that
might
say
154
applies.
every
death
row
inmate
is
identically
situated
to
the
person
you're
just
describing.
unknown
speaker
where
they...
whether
the
state
has
said
anything
as
long
as
there
is
any
genuine
concern
that
the
state
might
attempt
to
qualify,
that
person
is
going
to
be
facing
the
kind
of
dilemma
that
you're
bringing
to
our
attention.
so
i
don't
see
anything
that
you...
anything
additional
stemming
from
what
the
california
attorney
general
said
unless
a
state
says,
look,
we're
know
we're
so
far
away
from
compliance,
and
some
of
them
have,
i
understand,
so
it's
going
to
be
153
for
us,
because
we
could
never
prove
that
we
have
all
our
ducks
in
line.
unless
a
state
is
saying
that
it's
153
for
us
because
we
can't
comply
with
154,
then
every
defendant,
every
person
on
death
row
in
any
state
that
might
claim
154
could
bring
exactly
the
case
that
you're
bringing,
a
class
action.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
laurence,
getting
down
to
one
of
the
themes
that
we
have
here,
which
is
what's
different
about
the
claim
that
you're
making
from
the
claim
of
any
litigant
who
says,
i'm
not
quite
sure
when
to
sue,
so
i'd
like
to
bring
a
preliminary
threshold
action
to
litigate
the
possibility
of
affirmative
defense
of
the
statute
of
limitations--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
at
stake
here
that's
not
at
stake
there?
in
each
of
those
cases,
if
the
litigant
comes
in
on
the
assumption
that
the
shorter
statute
applies,
the
litigant
is
going
to
lose
some
luxury
of
time
which
the
litigant
would
have
had
if
the
longer
statute
applies,
so
no
question,
you
would
lose
that,
too.
do
you
lose
anything
else?
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
if
one
or
the
other
applies,
he
better
get
his
petition
for
counsel
in
fast.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
is
that
enough
to
elevate
this
to
the
level
of
a
case
or
controversy
whereas
a
normal
statute
of
limitations
doubt
would
not
suffice
as
a
case
or
controversy?
unknown
speaker
what
about
his
suggestion
that
you
could
structure
this
differently?
i
take
it
to
be
that
you
file
it
within
180
days.
you
move
for
a
stay
for
a
year-and-a-half.
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
that's
absurd,
a
stay
for
a
year-and-a-half,
because
the
congress
wants
this
quickly.
you
stipulate
that
it
is
absurd,
unless
they
don't
comply,
you
see,
making
your
legal
argument.
the
judge
decides
one
way
or
the
other.
you
ask
for
a
certified
appeal.
you
get
an
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
i
take
it
he's
suggesting
something
like
that
as
a
route.
is
there
anything
wrong...
of
course,
i
don't
know
if
you
can
structure
it
that
way
or
not.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
couldn't
get
a
class,
but
you
could
get
a
test
case.
unknown
speaker
everybody
would
have
to
file
the
protective
and
ask
for
the
stay.
i
mean...
i'm
trying
to
make
something
of
what
he
was
saying.
unknown
speaker
and
everybody
would
have
to
file
within
the
180
days,
immediately
move
for
a
stay,
so
he
can
bring
it
a
year
later,
and
the
issue
of
whether
that
stay
is
proper
or
not
proper
would
turn
on
exactly
what
you
want
to
raise.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
also
true
that
it's
not
just
a
stay.
the
first
petition
he
files
may
be
incomplete.
he
may
not
have
thought
of
all
his
claims.
the
question
would
be
whether
he
has
a
right
to
amend
after
the
period
goes
by
if
154
applies.
unknown
speaker
amend
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
we
have
certain
rules,
too,
you
know,
as
to
when
various
pleadings
have
to
be
filed,
as
well
as
statutory
rules
about,
you
know,
how
long
after
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
you
can
seek
certiorari.
why
is
your
case
different
from
the
case
in
which
someone
claims
that
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
entered
at
a
much
later
date
than
the
other
side
could
plausibly
claim?
can
that
person
bring
a
suit
against
the
other
side
asserting
that
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
appeals
was
entered
at
the
later
date
in
order
that
he
can
assure
himself
of
having
another
year
to
prepare
his
petition
for
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
oh,
it
doesn't
depend
on
the...
oh,
i
see.
it
depends...
you
mean,
it
depends
on
the
action
of
whether
the
state
has
adopted
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
not
on
whether
the
state
has...
is
taking
the
position
that
they
satisfy
the
statute.
yes.
unknown
speaker
that
is--
unknown
speaker
--and
that
answer
would
be
yes
even
if
the
state
had
said
nothing
at
all
on
this
question,
just
the
fact
that
they
might
do
it?
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
be
clear
on
what
your
position
is,
that
this
could
be
done
in
every
state
except
for
those
states
that
have
admitted
that
they
fall
far
short
of
what's
required
to
fit
under
154.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
fact
that
there
are
only
six
people
in...
maybe,
if
that's
what
you're
talking
about
in
maryland
on
death
row,
it
still
would
have
to
bring
this
kind
of
a
threshold
case,
because
whether
we're
talking
about
six
