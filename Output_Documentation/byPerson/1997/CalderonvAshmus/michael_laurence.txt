mr.
michael
laurence
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
this
court
is
when
a
state
has
declined
to
participate
in
a
federal
program,
does
ex
parte
young
permit
a
declaratory
judgment
action
to
prevent
state
officials
from
unlawfully,
not
necessarily
illegally,
obtaining
the
benefits?
mr.
michael
laurence
the
unlawfully
aspect
of
this
case
is
that
ex
parte
young
doesn't
focus
merely
on
whether
the
state's
actions
are
illegal,
but
rather
whether
or
not
the
state's
actions
interfere
with
a
cognizable
federal
right,
and
that
is
precisely
what--
mr.
michael
laurence
--the
question
of
whether
or
not
california's
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
chapter
154
is
one
that
congress
determined
by
the
presence
of
a
statute.
either
153
applies--
mr.
michael
laurence
--that's
absolutely
correct.
the
state
does
not
have
to
opt
in
under
chapter
154.
they
can
maintain
the
status
quo
under
chapter
153,
and
states
cannot
be
sued
to
be
forced
to
opt
in
under
chapter
154,
but
congress
did
say
that
if
the
state
does
not
opt
in
to
chapter
154,
they
are
not
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
chapter
154.
mr.
michael
laurence
what
the
district
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
as
well
as
a
matter
of
law
is
that
the
effect
of
the
threats
that
the
state
of
california
would
invoke
chapter
154
in
future
habeas
proceedings
was
that
petitioners
were
forced
to
comply
with
154
in...
without
regard
to
the
law.
mr.
michael
laurence
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
chapter
154
does
not
apply
in
california.
that
was
the
basis
for
the
declaratory
judgment.
to
give
effect
to
that
declaratory
judgment,
however,
the
court
found
it
necessary
to
enact
a
re...
antirelitigation
injunction,
preventing
the
state
from
going
to
the
next
courtroom
and
saying,
we
don't
care
what
this
judge
said
over
here,
chapter
154
does
apply
here,
in
an
attempt
at
creating
divergence
opinions,
and
divergent
opinions
are
precisely
what
justice
o'connor
pointed
to
as
the
problem.
mr.
michael
laurence
that
is
absolutely
correct,
that
whether
or
not
you're
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
does
not
turn
on
whether
or
not
the
state
officials
have
already
asserted
compliance
with
chapter
154.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
think
there
are
two
limiting
principles
here
that
would
prevent
that
kind
of
result.
the
first
one
is
the
operation
of
ex
parte
young
can
only
apply
when
congress
has
established
two
mutually
exclusive
procedures
for
governing
habeas
procedures
and
the
state
is
the
gatekeeper.
mr.
michael
laurence
that
goes
to
the
second
limiting
principle
that
i
think
is
present
in
this
case,
and
let
me
first
say
that
standing,
ripeness,
and
cause
of
action
were
all
litigated
below,
and
the
state
has
waived
any
consideration
by
this
court
of
those
issues.
mr.
michael
laurence
absolutely
not.
mr.
michael
laurence
and
i
agree,
your
honor,
and
to
clarify
my
earlier
remarks,
the
cause
of
action
argument
was
the
one
that
was
expressly
raised
by
the
petitioners
in
the
reply
brief,
but--
mr.
michael
laurence
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
laurence
if
we
fulfill
the
requirements
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
which
is
a
discretionary
jurisdiction
but
is
limited
to
specific
circumstances
where
the
rights
and
responsibilities
of
the
parties
must
be
decided
before
there's
irreparable
injury,
then
i
believe
we
are
properly
before
this
court.
mr.
michael
laurence
that's
correct,
and
under
section
1331
there's
no
question
that
this
court
has
jurisdiction
because
this
dispute
arose
from
a
federal
statute.
which
of
the
two
competing
procedures
apply
to
habeas
petitioners
in
california.
mr.
michael
laurence
it's
not
an
abstract--
mr.
michael
laurence
--and
the
claim
of
right
i
believe
stems
from
chapter
153
and
154.
congress
said--
mr.
michael
laurence
--congress
i
believe
established
that
these
two
procedures
cannot
coexist,
that
habeas
petitioners,
by
default,
as
this
court
recognized
in
lindh
v.
murphy,
are
entitled
to
the
benefits
of
chapter
153.
they
have
1...
up
to
1
year
to
file
their
federal
petitions.
they
have
the
normal
rules
of
amending
those
petitions,
and
they
have
the
additional
procedures
that
are
governed
by
153.
chapter
154
is
far
more
restrictive,
requiring
habeas
petitioners
to
do
far
more
faster
than
anything
we
ever
saw
in
chapter
153.
if
congress
intended
our
rights
to
be
vindicated
under
chapter
153,
the
only
way
to
obtain
those
rights
is
a
declaration
that
we
are
entitled
to
those
rights.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
believe
in
most
circumstances
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
michael
laurence
a
statute
of
limitations
that
does
not
depend
upon
an
assertion
of
a
defense
by
a
state
officer
does
not
involve
the
same
kind
of
problems
that
were
recognized
in
ex
parte
young.
mr.
michael
laurence
i'm
sorry,
it
does
make
it
more
difficult
to
understand
what
the
law
is,
but
congress
has
not
established
these
two
independent
statute
of
limitations
depending
on
what
the
state
officials
do
after
you
have
filed
in
excess
of
the
time
permitted
by
one
of
those
statute
of
limitations.
mr.
michael
laurence
absolutely
not.
mr.
michael
laurence
it
makes
a
difference
in
that
they
can
only
apply
if
the
state
qualifies,
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
don't
believe
that
any
court
has
held
that
we
are
going
to
apply
chapter
154
despite
the
fact
the
state
has
not
demonstrated--
mr.
michael
laurence
--i
respectfully
disagree.
i
do
believe
that
this
is
a
unique
situation
where
congress
has
said
the
states
must
come
forward
and
demonstrate
that
they
opt
in
to
get
these
beneficial
provisions.
if
a
state
fails
to
do
that,
then
the
habeas
petitioners
have
the
right
under
chapter
153
to
have
their
habeas
proceedings
processed
by
that
chapter.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
think
the
case
most
on
point
is
this
court's
decision
in
steffel
v.
thompson,
in
which
this
court
said
a
threat
for
future
proceedings
brought
by
state
officers
which
interferes
with
a
person's
federal
rights
is
a
proper...
proper
forum
to
bring
it
within
a
declaratory
judgment
act.
mr.
michael
laurence
if
i
remember
the
facts
correctly,
the
two
people
who
brought
the
lawsuit
originally
had
not
been
arrested.
mr.
michael
laurence
the
continuing
threat
was
the
threat
to
take
action.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
mr.
michael
laurence
but
this
court
hasn't
distinguished
between
arresting
or
threatening
some
other
type
of
proceeding
for
the
purposes
of
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
and
in
fact
the
state's
position
in
this
case
before
the
district
court
was
that,
despite
the
fact
that
a
declaratory
judgment
act...
declaratory
judgment
would
be
entered,
they
planned
and
were
wishing
to
seek
a
divergent
opinion
in
the
very
next
courtroom.
that
is
the
basis
for
the
injunction.
mr.
michael
laurence
you
certainly
have
to
make
a
showing
that
there's
an
actual
case
or
controversy
as
well
as
the
particular
requirements
of
standing,
federal
jurisdiction,
and
everything
else,
but
the
state
here
has
conceded
that
a
declaratory
judgment
was
proper
in
the
district
court
if
it
had
been
made
in
a
habeas
proceeding
in
behalf
of
an
individual
petitioner.
mr.
michael
laurence
well,
in
the
district
court
they
did,
your
honor,
and
i
refer
to
the
proceedings
that
were
conducted
on
may
6,
1996,
where
they
actually...
i'm...
pardon
me.
they
stated
that
a
declaratory...
you
can
get
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
actual
habeas
proceeding
brought
by
mr.
troy
ashmus.
now,
of
course,
they
can't
concede
federal
court
jurisdiction,
nor
can
they
concede
any
of
the
other
aspects.
mr.
michael
laurence
it
certainly
doesn't
have
the
label
of
a
declaratory
judgment,
necessarily,
but
when
we
were
discussing
the
alternatives
in
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
the
state
took
the
position
that
you
would
get
the
same
declaratory
judgment
in
mr.
ashmus'
habeas
proceeding.
that
would
be
a
binding
order
that
would
provide
some
protection
to
mr.
ashmus.
now,
of
course,
this
case
wasn't
brought
only
on
behalf
of
mr.
ashmus.
it
is
a
class
action--
mr.
michael
laurence
--the
person
actually
wanted
to
handbill
at
a
mall
and
was
threatened
with
arrest
for
loitering,
for
distributing
the
handbills.
mr.
michael
laurence
maybe
it
would
be
helpful
if
i
bring
it
to
actually
one
individual
case.
mr.
clarence
ray,
who
was
affirmed...
his
convictions
and
death
sentence
was
affirmed
by
the
california
supreme
court
on
may
6,
1996.
a
reading
of
chapter
154
by
anyone
would
say
that
the
time
for
filing
his
federal
petition
has
begun
to
run
unless
he
takes
some
further
action.
mr.
michael
laurence
where
they
have
to
make
some
decision
about
how
to
proceed.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
would
think
they
would
have
to
show
some
actual
case
or
controversy.
they
would
have
to
demonstrate
that
the
state
could
plausibly
claim
entitlement
to
chapter
154.
mr.
michael
laurence
but
i
would
think
that
those
kinds
of
situations
likely
are
going
to
be
resolved
either
by
this,
resorting
to
this
mechanism,
or
by
individuals
in
cases
such
as
maryland,
which
has
only
six
people
on
death
row
at
the
time
they
filed
their
complaint,
in
any
individual
case.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
think
that--
mr.
michael
laurence
--you
do
if
you're
uncertain
as
to
the
law
and
you
don't
know,
for
example,
in
mr.
ray's
case
what
he
should
have
done
on
may
6,
his
options
are
this:
he
could
have
filed
a
pro
se
federal
petition
without
the
assistance
of
counsel
to
toll
the
time
for
the
chapter
154
statute
of
limitations.
he
could
have
filed
a
pro
se
state
habeas
petition.
his
first
petition
would
toll
the
statute
of
limitations,
yet
he
would
have
done
so
without
the
basis
of
investigation
or
resources
that
congress--
mr.
michael
laurence
--he
has
to
make
some
decisions.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
think
the
congress
has
set
up
this
statutory
scheme
where
it
intends
one
of
the
two
circumstances
to
apply,
and
those
circumstances
involve
the
risk
that
people
will
be
executed
because
they
have
made
the
wrong
choice.
mr.
michael
laurence
it
is
possible
for
the
110
individuals
who
are
in
federal
court--
mr.
michael
laurence
--but
the
test
case
would
not
have
been
resolved
until
after
the
running
of
that
6
months.
mr.
michael
laurence
absolutely.
mr.
michael
laurence
and
that
would
have
been
a
remedy
for
the
50
or
so
individuals
in
federal
court
at
the
time
we
brought
this
lawsuit
who
hadn't
filed
petitions
yet,
but
our
class
contains
300
members
who
were
not
in
federal
court
or
who
were
in
federal
court
without
counsel.
mr.
monteo,
who's
case
was
affirmed
on
april
26,
had
to
wait
6
months
before
he
got
counsel
from
the
district
court.
during
that
time
period,
if
he
had
not
been
part
of
this
lawsuit,
he
would
have
had
to
make
a
decision
to
either
file
a
declaratory
judgment
motion
by
himself
or
a
federal
petition
by
himself
in
order
to
stay
the
tolling
of
the
time
period.
it
is
those
individuals
who
don't
have
counsel
or
the
ability
to
get
into
federal
court
who
had
to
know
which
of
these
two
provisions
apply.
mr.
michael
laurence
that's
absolutely
correct,
because
if
you
file
your
petition
and
you're
governed
by
chapter
153,
the
normal
rules
of
amendments
apply,
but
if
you're...
if
you
file
a
petition
and
you're
governed
by
chapter
154,
you
cannot--
mr.
michael
laurence
--except
under
exceptional
circumstances
amend
that
petition.
all
the
petitioners
and
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case
are
asking
for
is
some
guidance
as
to
how
the
rules
are
going
to
be
played
in
federal
court.
they
ask
for
no
more,
but
they
certainly
ask
for
no
less.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
don't
believe
so.
i
don't--
mr.
michael
laurence
--i
don't
believe
that
the
rules
governing
when
you
must
file
the
cert
petition
depend
upon
the
actions
of
the
other
party.
that
is
precisely
the
situation
here.
mr.
michael
laurence
absolutely.
mr.
michael
laurence
exactly,
and
the
other
option
that
the
habeas--
mr.
michael
laurence
--petitioners
had
is
that
they
could
have
waited
until
their
petitions
were
finally
complete,
filing
them
6,
7,
8,
9
months
after
their
direct
appeal
was
concluded,
and
risk
having
the
state
come
in
and
say,
i'm
sorry,
you
will
be
executed
because
you
failed
to
comply
with
the
6-month
statute
of
limitations.
and
justice
o'connor's
question
at
the
beginning
of
this
proceeding
i
think
was
completely
appropriate,
which
is,
do
we
want
to
have
a
uniform
resolution
of
the
systemic
question,
and
i
think
the
answer
has
to
be
yes,
and
you
have
to
provide
habeas
petitioners
with
some
means
of
ascertaining
their
rights.
mr.
michael
laurence
i
believe
so.
i
believe
that
it
does
not
depend
on
whether
or
not
they
assert
compliance
if
they
have
the
capability
of
asserting
compliance.
if
they
sat
in
their
offices
and
said,
we'll
let
you
know
in
6
months
whether
or
not
the
statute
is
going
to
apply
to
you,
then
i
think
you
have
a
declaratory
judgment
act
that
allows
you
to
come
in
and
say,
we
have
a
real
controversy
here,
because
congress
says
there
are
two
competing
mechanisms.
please
decide--
mr.
michael
laurence
--or
where
the
issue
has...
doesn't
have
to
address
400
individuals.
for
example,
maryland,
which
could
have
done
this
in
a
simple
district
court
action
in
which
the
habeas
petitioner
could
have
resolved
that
issue
on
his
behalf.
we're
talking
about
california,
that
has--
mr.
michael
laurence
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
if
you've
satisfied
the
requirements
for
the
declaratory
judgment
act.
thank
you.
