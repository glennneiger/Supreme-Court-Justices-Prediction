justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
wallace,
it
has
to
come
from
some
place
originally.
it
wasn't
congress
that
invented
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
it
is
a
doctrine
that
the
court
has
applied
and
interpreted,
so
the
court
must
make
a
determination
whether
the
immunity
you
claim
exists
or
not.
it
can't
just
say,
well,
we'll
leave
it
to
congress.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
talk
about
the
practical
importance
a
minute.
with
increasing
commercial
activity
between
tribes
and
nontribal
members
off
the
reservation
there
may
be,
indeed,
a
need
for
some
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
to
make
it
possible
for
tribes
to
have...
enter
into
business
dealings
with
people
off
the
reservation.
is
congress
considering
legislation
about
this
right
now,
do
you
know,
mr.
dumont?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
congress
is
debating
the
desirability,
or
lack
thereof,
of
certain
waivers
of
sovereign
immunity.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
state
applied
its
own
state
law
in
resolving
this.
don't
we
have
to
look
at
federal
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
can
you
defend
the
state
court
decision
by
applying
state
law
to
answer
this
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
that
for
you
to
argue
for
affirmance
here
you
would
have
to
at
least
justify
it
on
the
basis
of
federal
law
principles.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is
a
suit
on
a
promissory
note
where
on
its
face
it
said
sovereign
immunity
wasn't
waived.
i
mean,
what
if
somebody's
going
to
enter
into
a
deal
with
an
indian
tribe,
and
accept
a
promissory
note,
i
guess
you
could
as
a
matter
of
contract
law
insist
that
there
be
a
tribal
waiver
before
you'll
accept
that
arrangement
and
note,
and
there
wasn't
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
a
little
like
buyer
beware.
i
mean,
if
in
fact
the
law
is,
as
this
court
seems
to
have
recognized
in
the
past,
that
the
tribe
enjoys
sovereign
immunity
from
private
suits,
then
someone
dealing
with
the
tribe
should
protect
himself
in
the
contractual
arrangements
that
he
makes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
this
tribe
have
a
reservation?
that's
wrong.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
it
have
a
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
so
under
your
position,
whatever
it
does,
wherever
it
does
it,
there's
no
immunity,
because
there
is
no
reservation
here.
