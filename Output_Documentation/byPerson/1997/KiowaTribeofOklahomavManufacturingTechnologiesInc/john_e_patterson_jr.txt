mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
very
simple.
it's
whether
the
tribe
has
sovereign
immunity
for
its
offreservation
commercial
activities.
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
urge
a...
an
immunity
for
the
tribe
which
is
greater
than
that
which
is
afforded
to
a
state,
which
is
greater
than
that
afforded
to
a
foreign
sovereign.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
it
is
a
federal
law
issue
which
can
be
determined
very
properly,
as
this
was,
in
the
district
court
of
oklahoma
county
and
in
the
state
courts
of
oklahoma
under
oklahoma
tax
commission
v.
graham.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
the
state--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--the
state
court
looked
to
federal
common
law
in
part.
it
looked
to
padilla,
a
new
mexico
case,
which
in
turn
looked
to
nevada
v.
hall
for
the
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
as
between
competing
sovereigns.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
and
we
do
very
much.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
yes,
except
the...
if
i
understand
your
question,
justice
souter,
the
lower
court
made
its
decision
based
on
principally
mescalero
apache
tribe
v.
jones,
and
the
language
which
has
been
referred
to,
the
situation
has
been
referred
to
which
is
to
the
effect--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--the
oklahoma
supreme
court
in
hoover,
which
is...
was
held
to
be
controlling
in
this
case,
was
based
on
an
examination,
and
my
understanding
of
federal
law
as
enunciated
by
this
court,
and
in
light
of
federal
statutes.
the
question
is,
what
is
the
nature
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
that's
the
question
that
is
before
you
for
your
decision
today.
the
congress
has
not
created
any
immunity
for
the
tribe
when
it
goes
off-reservation
in
tribal
activities.
this
has
been
adverted
to
previously.
the
principles
of
immunity,
if
applied
as
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
are
urging,
then
any
of
320
approximately
federally
recognized
indian
tribes
can
go
off
tribal
lands
into
the
50
united
states
and
engage
in
any
kind
of
commercial
activity
with
complete
immunity
from
federal
law,
with
impunity,
if
you
will--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--the
tribe
can't...
in
the
commercial
contract
case
you
have
two
parties
of
supposedly
equal
statute.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
if
you
have
a
tribal
operation,
a
business
office
in
tulsa,
oklahoma,
for
instance,
where
there
are
business
invitees
in
that
tribe,
they
are
not
people
who
have
available
waiver,
for
instance,
of
sovereign
immunity.
if
they
suffer
an
injury
on
the
premises,
then
their
only
recourse
is
against
the
owner-landlord-manager.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
if
i
might,
justice
o'connor,
reading
from
the
record
at
page
14,
the
language
is,
nothing
in
this
note
subjects
or
limits
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
kiowa
tribe
of
oklahoma,
and
we
don't
have
any
argument
with
that
language.
i'm
not
sure
what
it
means,
but
it's
based
on
a
premise--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--once
again,
if
it's
activity
which
is
protected
by
sovereign
immunity
that's
exactly
the
case.
it's
our
position
that
the
tribe
has
no
sovereign
immunity
when
it
goes
off
tribal
lands--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--in
a
commercial--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--the
cases
which
amounts
to
the
general
rule
that
the
tribe
is
not
subject
to
suit
absent
its
waiver
or
a
congressional
abrogation
of
immunity
arose
historically
out
of
cases
where
the
tribe
was
acting
in
proper
tribal
matters
on
a
tribal
reservation,
on
land.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
the
place
of
the
contract
in
this
particular
case
is
of
critical
difference.
if
the
place
of
the
contract
and
place
of
performance
were
to
be
on
tribal
lands,
then
we
would
have
the
rules
which
the
government
and
the
kiowa
tribe
argue.
when
the
tribe
goes
outside
tribal
lands
in
a
commercial
venture,
then
you
have
to
look
to
the
nature
of
its
sovereignty,
and
we
say
that
in
that
instance
the
tribe
has
no
sovereign
immunity
from
suit.
the
expression
of
the
inability
of
money
damage,
a
suit
being
brought
against
the
tribe,
was
looked
at
in
potawatomi,
citizens
band
potawatomi,
and
there
the
state
was
found
to
have
sufficient
interest
in
the
activity,
the
levy
of
an
oklahoma
tax
on
a
nonmember
of
the
tribe
in
a
sale
on
tribal
lands,
that
the
state
was
allowed
to
impose
certain
minimal
regulation
on
the
tribe.
however,
the
second
aspect
of
that,
could
the
state
exercise
the
most
efficient
means
of
collecting
the
monies
that
were
owed
to
it,
could
it
sue
the
tribe
directly,
the
answer
was
no.
now
then,
when
you
read
that,
and
look
at
that
in
light
of
mescalero...
and
mescalero
apache
was
cited
in
citizen
band
potawatomi
for
the
proposition
that
you
don't
find
the
same
immunity
when
the
tribe
goes
off
of
tribal
lands.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
there--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--and
we
would
urge
that
that
is,
in
fact,
the
rule.
that
is
the
common
law
rule
that
when
a
sovereign
goes
outside
its
sovereign
territory,
outside
its
jurisdiction,
then
it
is
no
longer
covered
by
sovereign
immunity
as
a
matter
of
right.
the
only
protection
that
it
receives
is
under
the
principles
of
race
and
comity,
will
comity
be
accorded
the
visiting
sovereign
when...
in
nevada
v.
hall,
one
which
is
not
an
indian
exemption,
indian
sovereign
immunity
case
but
it
has...
the
principles
are
appropriate.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
that's
not
my
understanding,
justice
scalia.
i
believe--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--no,
absolutely
not,
it
does
apply.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
i
was
afraid
i
was
not
communicating
with
you--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--i
had
misspoken
my
position.
it's
manufacturing
technologies'
position
that
when
the
tribe
goes
outside
of
its
reservation
boundaries,
then
it's
subject
to--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--as
per
mescalero--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--and
that
is
the
distinction.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
in
the
international
rule,
once
again,
when
a
sovereign
conducts
activities
on
its...
in
its
own
jurisdiction,
then
it
is
sovereign.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
this
tribe
has
approximately
1,200
acres
of
land--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--it
does
not
have
a
reservation.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
that's
not
our
position.
when...
the
mescalero
case
speaks
in
terms
of
reservation.
some
tribes
have
very
large
reservations...
the
navajo.
others
have
less,
less
acres
of
land
under
their
jurisdiction
and
control
than
do
the
kiowas,
but
indian
country,
reservation,
lands
held
in
tribal
trust,
i
believe
that
to
some
degree,
each
of
those
may
be,
may
support
activities
which
are
protected
by
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
because
the...
historically
the
immunity
which
was
accorded
the
indian
sovereign
was
as
to
the
tribe's
acts
on
tribal
lands
in
relation
to
its
own
internal
affairs,
management
of
its
internal
affairs.
the--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--the...
if
i
may
answer
indirectly,
the
rationale
of
potawatomi
in
separating
regulatory
and
adjudicatory
authority
of
the
state
in
that
case,
it
was
critical
that
the
activities
there
involved
took
place
on
state
land...
i'm
sorry,
on
tribal
lands.
the
first
ruling
of
the
court
was
to
the
effect
that
the
lands,
which
were
lands
which
had
been
purchased
and
held
in
trust,
were
held
in
trust
for
the
tribe,
were
in
fact
tribal
lands
sufficient
to
invoke
jurisdiction...
invoke
immunity.
when
you
move
then,
though,
to
mescalero
apache,
you
go
to
an
activity
which
is
off
tribal
lands
and
now
you
have
to
look
once
again
at
the
question
whether
or
not
there
is
tribal
sovereign
immunity
for
acts
which
take
place
off
lands,
off
tribal
lands,
and
this
court
found
in
mescalero
that
there
was
no
immunity
for
off-reservation
commercial
activities.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
and...
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
that
may
very
well
be
of
more
limited
jurisdiction.
however,
the
principles
announced
in
mescalero
would
support
our
position
that
when
the
tribe
goes
off
tribal
lands
it's
then
subject
to
nondiscriminatory
state
law,
applied
equally
to
all
citizens
of
the
state.
the
stretch
for
manufacturing
technologies
is
to
get
from
a
taxation
case,
state
taxation
case
to
a
commercial
activity
off
tribal
lands,
and
we
feel
that
you
can
make
that...
we
feel
that
you
can
rule
that
the
tribe
does
not
have
immunity
in
an
off-tribal-land
commercial
activity
because
of
the
general
principle
enunciated
in
mescalero
apache.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
that...
no...
that
would
be
correct.
to
run
down
the
line,
when
the
tribe
goes
off
tribal
lands,
then
in
the
language
of,
i
think
nevada
v.
hall,
it
implicates
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
but
this
can
be
true
in
any
one
of
the
50
states.
there's
no
limitation
on
kiowa
tribal
activities
in
oklahoma.
they
may
be
activities
conducted
in
honolulu,
hawaii.
commercial
laws
of
the
state
where
the
state
interest
in
potawatomi
was
limited
in
a
nontribal
land
situation,
the
state
interest
is
much
greater
in
an
off-reservation
situation,
so
you
have
nondiscriminatory
state
laws
regarding
contract,
commercial,
occupational,
licensing...
the
whole
gamut
of
possible
state
regulation,
and
the
tribe
would
be
subject
to
that.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
that
is
right,
once
again,
as
modified
by
the
language
in
mescalero,
absent
federal
law
to
the
contrary.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
the...
and...
i
believe
that
i'm
correct
when
i
say
that
the...
they...
the
rule
of
mescalero
is
based
on
a
finding
that
there
was
no
tribal
sovereign
immunity
for
the
off-reservation
activity.
that
was
the
foundation
for
that
rule.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
well,
once
again,
in
respondent's
view,
potawatomi
announced
the
rule
for
onreservation
activity.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
our
position
is
that
that
rule
doesn't
travel
off
the
reservation.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
justice--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
i
find
none.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
case
of
first
impression.
however,
mescalero
once
again
stands
for
the
proposition
that
the
state...
i'm
sorry,
the
federal
government
does
not
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
tribe.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
arising
in
tribal
taxing
situations,
mostly,
to
the
effect
that
the
states
do
have
authority
over
certain
aspects
of
activities
on
tribal
lands.
the
potawatomi
case
separated
the
regulatory
from
the
adjudicatory
authority,
and
it
wasn't
the
first
case.
i
think
colville
perhaps
did
the
same
thing,
and
in
colville
the
court
said
that
the
state
of
washington
could
seize
cigarettes
before
they
ever
got
to
the
reservation,
and
thereby
satisfy
its
claims.
united
states
v.
strate
was
a
case
which
i
believe
remarried
the
adjudicatory
and
regulatory
authority
of
a
state
on
certain
activities
on
tribal
lands,
but
it's
really
not
to
the
point
that
we're
talking
about
today.
our
point
is
that
we
have
one
rule
for
potawatomi,
for
on-reservation
activity.
off-reservation
activity
is
a
whole
different
matter.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
if
i...
if
i
understand
you,
you
ask
is
this
a
state
law
question
to
be--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--i--
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
--in
my
view
this
is
not
a
state
law
question.
we're
talking
about
federal
statutes,
treaties,
the
constitution...
these
are
federal
questions.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
i
would
agree
that...
i
think
the
principal
issues
are
federal
law
principles,
but
once
you
find
that
a
state
has
certain
rights,
then
you
do
get
into
the
state
law
aspect
of
the
question,
and
this
court
has
dealt
with
that
in
a
number
of
cases
on-reservation,
arising
out
of
state
regulatory
actions.
the...
i
think
that
puyallup
was
mentioned
a
moment
ago.
puyallup
had
to
do
with
fishing
rights
onreservation.
to
that
degree,
we
feel
that
it's
not
controlling
in
our
situation.
this
situation
relates
to
the
activities
of
the
tribe
when
it
goes
beyond
its
boundaries.
nevada,
in
reciting
some
of
the
rule
says,
number
1,
a
sovereign
cannot
be
sued
in
its
own
courts
without
its
consent.
that
is
the
rule.
whatever
rights
the
visiting
sovereign,
the
sovereign
that
comes
into
the
property,
into
the
jurisdiction
of
the
first
sovereign,
the
host
sovereign
has,
are
there
merely
as
a
matter
of
comity.
they're
not
accorded
any
rights
as
a
matter
of
their
own
independent
sovereignty,
because
they're
now
in
some
other
sovereign's
jurisdiction.
what
the
tribe
seeks,
what
the
united
states
wants
to
give
them
in
this
case
is
a
sovereignty
which
says
that
when
the
tribe
goes
into
another
court's
jurisdiction...
the
state
of
oklahoma,
the
state
of
hawaii,
the
state
of
whatever,
that
at
that
point
the
tribe's
sovereignty
supersedes
that
of
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
oklahoma,
and
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
no
ability
to
sue
it
or
to
control
that
activity.
mr.
john
e.
patterson,
jr.
that
is
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
the
basis
for
indian
law,
indian
sovereignty,
certainly
has
to
do
with
the
relationship
between
the
tribe
and
the
u.s.
government.
in
this
case,
however,
in
our
opinion
the
u.s.
tries
to
go
outside
of
federal
common
law
and
other
law
as
we
know
it
and
give
the
tribe
immunity
when
it
takes
whatever
acts
in
a
commercial
vein
in
this
situation
outside
its
own
reservation,
outside
the
area
where
it
has
territorial
sovereign
immunity.
sovereign
immunity
always
has
a
territorial
aspect,
and
that's
what
we
ask
in
this
case,
is
that
territorial
aspect
be
respected
and
accorded
the
appropriate
proper
weight.
any
further
questions?
