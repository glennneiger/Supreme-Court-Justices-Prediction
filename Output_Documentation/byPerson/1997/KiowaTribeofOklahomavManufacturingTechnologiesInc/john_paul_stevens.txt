john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess,
i'm
a
little
puzzled
by--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
discussion.
there's
no
waiver
in
this
case,
is
there?
why
are
we
talking
about
waiver?
the
question
is
whether
there's
anything
that
needs
to
be
waived.
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
have
they
ever
passed
a
statute
saying
the
tribes
have
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
all
the
implicit
record.
is
there
any
statute
in
which
congress
has
expressly
said
tribes
shall
have
immunity?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that's
true
with
regard
to
tribal
commercial
activities
off
the
reservation?
are
there
no
state
regulatory
powers
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
of
course
the
debate
between
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
mescalero
was
whether
there
was
federal
law
to
the
contrary
in
that
case,
because
the
dissenters
claimed
that
they
were...
the
tribe
was
a
federal
instrumentality,
in
effect.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
it
correct
to
say
that
it's
both
a
federal
law
question
and
a
state
law
question,
because
if
there
is
a
federal
law
that
says
the
tribe's
immune
here,
that
would
obviously
control.
if
there's
no
federal
law,
a
state
still
could,
as
a
matter
of
comity,
recognize
the
immunity
of
the
tribe,
just
as
in
nevada
v.
hall
it
could
have
been
decided
the
other
way
as
a
matter
of
state
law.
so
you've
got...
it
seems
to
me
inevitably
you
have
both
a
federal
issue
and
a
state
law
issue,
and
the
state
law
issue
has
been
decided.
they're
not
going
to
show
comity
here,
and
they've
assumed
the
answer
to
the
federal
question,
and...
which
we
have
to
really
resolve.
