chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1037,
the
kiowa
tribe
of
oklahoma
v.
manufacturing
technologies,
inc.--
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
those
issues
that
you
mentioned
just
now,
are
they
necessarily
involved
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
quite
possible,
it
seems
to
me,
that
a
state
court
might
have
jurisdiction
to
enter
a
judgment
but
perhaps
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
do
some
of
the
things
which
you
describe
as
having
happened
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now,
that's
the
question
we
have
here,
is
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
that's
the
question--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
presented
in
your
petition.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
our
mescalero
opinion
we
said
that
activities
conducted
by
the
mescalero
band
off
the
reservation
were
subject
to
nondiscriminatory
state
taxes,
didn't
we?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
to
say,
absent
federal
law
to
the
contrary,
these
activities
are
subject
to
state
authority
suggests
that
the
congress
would
have
to
affirmatively
prohibit
the
jurisdiction,
rather
than
affirmatively
authorize
it,
the
way
you're
talking.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
never
changes?
i
mean,
what
if
circumstances
dramatically
change?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--where
does
your
position
leave
what
we
said
in
mescalero?
i
mean,
in
theory
the
state
can
collect
taxes,
but
it
can't
in...
it
has
no
practical
way
of
doing
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
mescalero
they
said
the
tribe
was
subject
to
taxation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
regulatory
jurisdiction
is
just
illusory
if
there's
no
way
to
enforce
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
could
there
be
damage
actions
against
the
tribe?
on
your
submission,
there
can't
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
patterson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
was
in
the
context
of
state
taxation,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
might
not
that
principle
be
perfectly
sound
in
the
case
of
state
taxation
but
perhaps
be
of
more
limited
effect
where
you're
talking
about
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
paterson.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
