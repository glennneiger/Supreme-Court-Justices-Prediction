mr.
r.
brown
wallace
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
oklahoma
state
courts
have
entered
a
money
judgment
against
the
kiowa
tribe
of
oklahoma.
they
have
entered
that
judgment
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
neither
the
tribe
nor
congress
have
weighed
the
tribe's
inherent
immunity
to
suit,
and
despite
the
fact
that
in
the
very
note
sued
upon,
the
parties
agreed
that
nothing
in
that
note
would
subject
or
limit
the
sovereign
rights
of
the
kiowa
tribe.
this
is
one
of
a
series
of
judgments
that
has
been
entered
against
the
kiowa
tribe
that
arises
out
of
the
same
transaction,
same
series
of
transactions.
the
enforcement
of
these
judgments
has
resulted
in
a
seizure
of
the
tribal
tax
revenues,
an
enjoining
of
the
tribe
from
enforcing
tribal
law
on
tribal
land,
a
garnishment
of
the
tribal
bank
accounts,
even
accounts
containing
federally
appropriated
funds,
and
generally
a
draining
of
the
tribal
treasury
to
the
point
of
crippling
the
tribe's
ability
to
maintain
its
governmental
functions.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
they
are
involved
in
the
case,
in
this
case
to
the
extent
that
they
show
the
true
impact
of
the
judgment
and
some
of
the
policy
reasons
why
congress
has
not
elected
to
waive
the
sovereign
immunity
of
tribes.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
i
think
you
would
have
to
look
more
deeply
at
what
kind
of
judgment,
and
whether
or
not
there
was
in
fact
a
waiver.
now,
if
we
assume
that
there
was
no
waiver,
i
would
take
the
position
that
the
judgment
could
be
at
best
declaratory,
and
relating
to
the
application
of
tribal...
the
application
of
state,
regulatory,
or
taxation
laws
to
the
tribe
when
it's
operating
certainly
without
tribal
country,
and
in
some
cases
i
think
the
state
taxation
laws
should
be
respected
by
the
tribe
within
indian
country.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
well,
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
it
depends
very
much
on
how
the
waiver
is
structured.
typically,
when
tribes
engage
in
the
activity
of
waiving
their
immunity
they
not
only
select
a
court
that
they're
going
to
go
into,
designate
the
kind
of
causes
of
action
that
they
will
be
subject
to,
but
they
also
regulate
the
extent
to
which
they
expose
their
assets
to
court
process.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
well,
in
representing
a
tribe
in
that
situation
i
would
certainly
take
the
position
that
until
there
is
a
waiver
with
respect
to
what
assets
can
be
subjected
to
the
judgment,
then
the
waiver
is
incomplete,
that
in
order
to
have
a
complete
and
effective
waiver
so
that
a
judgment
can
be
entered
and
can
be
enforced,
the
waiver
has
got
to
have
the
court
agreeing
that
it...
excuse
me,
have
the
tribe
agreeing
that
it
will
be
subject
to
court
process,
and
then
the
enforcement
must
also
be
specifically
covered.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
i
think
it's
in...
yes.
i
think
it's
insufficient
because
it
fails
to
designate
the
property,
the
sovereign
property
to
which
the
waiver
attaches.
the...
you
know,
the
immunity
of
a
sovereign
has
two
basic
concepts.
number
1,
the
agreement
of
the
sovereign
to
subject
itself
to
court
jurisdiction,
in
essence
the
agreement
to
create
jurisdiction
in
a
court,
and
then
the
second
concept
is
the
enforcement,
the
designation
of
exactly
what
remedial
devices
that
the
sovereign
will
be
subject
to.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
state
statutes
that
deal
with
state
sovereign
immunity
very
regularly
say
the
state
will
agree
to
be
sued
for
these
causes
of
action,
and
then
very
regularly
address
the
means
of
enforcement
of
those
causes
of
action...
or,
excuse
me,
of
any
judgments
under
those
causes
of
action.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
that
is
one
of
the
devices
that's
used.
oklahoma
in
fact
does
use
that
device.
i'm
familiar
with
that.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
foreign
sovereign--
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
--yes,
sir.
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
proceeds
on
a
slightly
different
theory
with
respect
to
the
handling
of
sovereign
immunity.
that's
a
situation
where
you
have
the
foreign
sovereign
dealing
with
the
immunity
of
another
sovereign.
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
the
legislature
has
chosen
to
respect
the
assets
of
the
foreign
sovereign
by
desig...
or
by
limiting
some
of
the
assets
that
are
subject
to
attachment.
it...
you
know,
it
attempts
to
leave
its
truly
governmental
assets,
you
know,
free
from--
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
--excuse
me?
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
well,
that's
true.
this
case
does
not
have
a
waiver
or
any
language
in
it
that
even
purports
to
be
a
waiver.
this
is
a
situation
where
the
state
of
oklahoma
has
concluded
that
its
courts
have
inherent
jurisdiction
over
an
indian
tribe,
and
it
does
not
need
the
federally
required
consent
to
suit
or
waiver
of
immunity
in
order
to
create
jurisdiction
in
oklahoma
courts.
the
reason
why
it's
concluded
that
is,
oklahoma
has
said
that
when
the
kiowa
tribe
engaged
in
commerce
off
of
kiowa
country,
then
it
did
away
with
the
federal
requirement
that
jurisdiction
be
created
by
consent
or
waiver.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
that's...
yes,
sir.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
yes,
your
honor.
that
is
the
question.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
i
can
remember
a
point
in
a
concurring
opinion
in
citizen
band
potawatomi
where
there
were...
where
there
was
a
question
raised
with
respect
to
whether
the
immunity
of
a
tribe
would
apply
to
commercial
activities
off
of
indian
country,
yes,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
the
congress
is
vested
with
exclusive
control
over
tribal
sovereignty
and
tribal
immunity
as
a
part
of
tribal
sovereignty.
congress
has
never
drawn
that
line
in
tribal
immunity.
in
fact,
when
congress
approaches
the
issue
of
tribal
immunity,
it
consistently
expresses
its
approval
of
the
doctrine.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
absent...
yes,
absent
federal
law
to
the
contrary,
the
court
held
that
the
activities
were
subject
to
nondiscriminatory
state
taxes.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
i
think
the
problem
with
the
line
of
reasoning
there
is
a
couplefold.
number
one,
mescalero
did
not
involve
immunity
to
suit.
mescalero
was
talking
about
immunity
with
respect
to
taxation.
this
court
has
characteristically
treated
the
tribes'
immunity
with
respect
to
taxation
and
regulation
very
differently
than
it
has
the
treated
tribes'
immunity
to
suit.
as
an
example,
i
take
you
to
the
citizen
band
case,
where
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
oklahoma
could
require
a
tribe
to
collect
oklahoma's
cigarette
taxes
for
on-reservation
sales
to
nonmembers.
you
said,
yes,
it
could,
but
when
oklahoma
then
asked
for
a
judgment
against
the
tribe,
a
money
judgment
against
the
tribe
for
taxes
that
hadn't
been
collected,
the
court
went
directly
to
the
issue,
or
directly
to
the
point
of
tribal
immunity
to
suit,
and
pointed
out
that
congress
has
long
approved
it,
congress
uses
it
as
a
part
of
its
overall
policy
with
respect
to
indian
tribes,
and
the
court
was
not,
under
those
circumstances,
disposed
to
modify
its
longstanding
approval
of
tribal
immunity.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
yes,
and
the
court
has
found
in
the
past
that
the
immunity
exists
as
an
aspect,
an
inherent
aspect
of
a
sovereign
that
preexists
the
constitution.
the
court
has
recog--
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
--yes,
your
honor,
and
i
think
the
distinction
is
probably
valid.
tribes
have
a
unique
relationship
with
the
federal
government.
the
federal
government
has
adopted
a
trust
responsibility
toward
tribes.
it
makes
them
extremely
different,
very
different
from
either
sister
states
or
foreign
nations.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
for
taxes?
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
well,
i...
if
the
acquisition
is
done
appropriately--
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
--the
ad
valorem
taxes
do
not
apply
to
the--
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
--well,
oklahoma
has
to
figure
out
collection
and
remedial
devices
short
of
going
to
the
court
and
filing
a
lawsuit.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
well,
in
the
regulatory
and
taxation
cases
this
court
has
approached
the
issue
on
an
infringement
and
preemption
analysis.
you
cannot
infringe
upon
tribal
self-government,
and
states
cannot...
and
states
cannot
do
anything
preempted
by
congress.
that
has
never
been
applied,
though,
to
a
damage
lawsuit
against
a
tribe
in
state
court.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
r.
brown
wallace
the
puyallup
three
case
involved
a
situation
where
tribal
immunity
protected
a
tribe
from
suit
by
the
state
to
regulate
off-reservation
fishing.
the
fishing
was
both
on
and
off
the
reservation.
the
tribe
was
protected
by
this
court
from
state
suit.
the
citizen
band
case,
with
respect
to
its
handling
of
tribal
immunity,
did
not
turn
on
geography.
instead,
the
court
went
directly
to
the
concept
that
there
had
been
a
long
recognition
of
the
inherent
immunity
of
the
tribe.
congress--
