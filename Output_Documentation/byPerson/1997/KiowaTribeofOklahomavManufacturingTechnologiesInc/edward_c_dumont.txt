mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
problem
here
is
a
state
court
did...
entered
a
judgment
which
did
two
things,
it
held
that
as
a
matter
of
state
law
the
tribe
was
not
immune
from
suit,
and
that's
wrong
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
it's
not
a
question
of
state
law,
it's
a
question
of
federal
law,
and
second,
federal
law,
federal
substantive
law
preserves
the
tribe's
immunity
from
suit,
and
let
me
just
address
those
for
moment.
the...
i
think
it
should
be
common
ground
that
this
is
a
matter
of
federal
law,
supervening
federal
law,
so
if
we
move
to
the
substance
of
the
federal
law,
the
rule
derives
from...
as
my
colleague
said,
it
originally
derives
from
the
preconstitutional
sovereign
status
of
the
tribes,
and
this
court
has
made
that
clear
repeatedly.
now,
it
is
also
supported
in
the
modern
context
by
at
least
three
very
firm
foundations.
first,
the
powerful
general
background
principle
of
what
sovereign
immunity
from
suit
means,
second,
the
history
of
the
federal
government's
relationship
with
the
tribes,
government
to
government,
and
this
court's
precedents,
and
third,
the
critical
practical
importance
of
immunity
from
suit
from
money
judgments
to
the
tribes
in
modern-day
america.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
they
are
actively
considering
it.
hearings,
extensive
hearings
were
held
in
1996.
there
was
a
bill
which
passed
the
senate
which
would
have
waived
immunity
in
certain
circumstances
in
'97.
that
provision
was
removed
on
the
premise,
publicly
stated,
that
hearings
would
be
held
by
april
30th
of
1998,
and
those
hearings
have
been
tentatively
scheduled
by
the
committee
on
indian
affairs
of
the
senate.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
correct,
and
congress
as
long
ago
as
1934
in
the
indian
reorganization
act
recognized
exactly
this
issue
that
you
bring
up
about,
and
that
the
oklahoma
courts
adverted
to
as
a
matter
of
policy,
which
is,
will
anyone
deal
with
the
tribes,
and
they
provided
in
the
oklahoma
welfare...
indian
welfare
act,
for
one
thing,
for
not
only
the
incorporation
of
tribal
governments
as
governments,
but
also
separate
incorporation
as
business
entities,
and
those
entities
are
or
may
be
subject
to
suit
in
certain
circumstances,
limited
to
their
business
property,
just
like
a
normal
corporation
would
be.
so
congress
has
thought
about
this
and
has
addressed
it
in
the
past,
and
they're
preparing
to
think
about
it
again.
they
really--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--there
are
a
number
of
statutes,
i
think
the
most
recent
one
being
the
indian
tribal
native
american
agricultural
reform
act
of
1993,
which
recognized
that
implicitly
by
saying
that
nothing
that
congress
is
doing--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
statute
that
says
that
in
those
terms.
i
would
say...
i
could
say,
though,
that
to
pass
a
statute
saying
the
tribe's
immunity
will
be
waived
in
the
following
circumstances,
or
under
the
following
very
special
circumstances,
is
to
say
that
we
assume
the
background
principle
is
immunity.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes,
and
i
would
say
that
because--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--yes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
you
would
have
had
to
wait
for
congress,
and
i
would
say
that
because
the
original
common
law,
if
you
will,
recognition
of
the
foreign...
of
the
scope
of
a
foreign
sovereign's
immunity
came
so
early
in
this
court's
history
and
this
country's
history
in
the
schooner
exchange
case
that
by
the
time
you
got
to
the
1950's,
when
the
state
department
was
recognizing
the
commercial
exception,
it
was
already
firmly
settled
in
this
court's
jurisprudence.
the
berizzi
brothers
case
in
1926,
for
instance,
made
clear
that
extended
to
commercial
property
of
a
sovereign.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
if
circumstances
dramatically
change,
then
it
is
always
the
prerogative
of
the
sovereign
to
make
its
own
decisions
about
what
cases
its
courts
will
entertain,
and
that's
true
from
the
schooner
exchange
on,
but
the
question
here
would
be
who
would
represent
the
sovereign
of
the
united
states,
and
this
court
had
made
clear
consistently
that
the
default
rule
was
going
to
be
absolute
immunity,
and
it
was
then
up
to
congress
to
vary
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
what
the
courts
had
recognized
was
that
in
cases
where
the
state
department
was
willing
to
represent
to
the
court
that
it
was
important...
that
it
was
not
important
that
immunity
should
not
be
recognized,
then
the
courts
would
frequently
accept
that
as
consistent
with--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--no,
but
the
state
department
is
a
political
branch
of
the
government,
and
i
think
our
submission
is
merely
that
the
court's
policy...
whether
the
court
had
the
power
to
do
it
or
not,
it
may
very
well
have
had
the
power
to
see
a
development
in
common
law,
but
the
court
did
not
do
that.
the
court
said,
look,
we
have
always...
and
berizzi
brothers
is
the
prime
case
on
this.
the
court
said
we
have
always
applied
a
rule
of
absolute
immunity.
we
see
no
reason
to
make
an
exception
for
commercial
property
just
because
it's
owned
by
a
sovereign.
that's
going
to
be
our
rule.
now,
of
course,
in
situations
where
the
political
branches
which
are
responsible
under
the
constitution
for
foreign
affairs
tell
us
to
do
something
different,
then
we
will
do
something
different,
but
the
default
rule
is
going
to
be
immunity,
and
i
think
that's
really
very
close
to
what
we're
saying
here.
now,
indian
tribal
sovereigns
are
different
from
foreign
sovereigns--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--against
a
foreign
sovereign,
or
against
a
tribal--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
there
are...
as
the
court
had
recognized
in
potawatomi,
there
may
be
ways,
some
of
them
more
effective,
some
of
them
less
effective.
there
might
be
a
suit
against
a
tribal
officer,
for
instance--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--they
cannot
sue
the
tribe,
and
the
tribe--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
under...
if
there's
a
specific
federal
statute,
which
in
rcra
i
believe
there
is,
there's
a
specific
waiver
by
congress
of
the--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--under
state...
a
state
may
not
proceed
under
state
law
to
get
an
injunction
directly
against
the
tribe.
now,
in
the
situations
you--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--yes.
yes,
of
course
you
can
stop
the
officer,
because
then
you're
stopping...
you're
exercising
jurisdiction
over
the
individual,
not
over
the
tribe,
but
can
you
seize
the
truck?
i
mean,
probably
not,
because
then
you
are
talking
about
the
property
of
the
tribe,
and
that's
the
distinction.
it's
a
crucial
distinction
between
the
tribe,
quae
tribe--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
it
leaves
the
tribe...
it
leaves
the
states
in
exactly
the
place
they
were
left
in
potawatomi,
which
is
they
have
a
variety
of
mechanisms
to
enforce
their
valid
regulations,
but
those
mechanisms
do
not
include
a
direct
judgment,
either
injunctive
or
monetary,
against
the
tribe,
and
that's...
i
think
that's
really
precisely
what
the
court
said
in
potawatomi.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
is
crucial
to
distinguish
between...
we
heard
in
the
first
argument
about
the
many...
the
hydra-headed
concept
of
jurisdiction.
i
think
it's
very
critical
to
distinguish
between
regulatory
jurisdiction,
jurisdiction
to
impose
rules
which
are
valid
and
must
be
obeyed
from
enforcement,
judicial
enforcement
jurisdiction,
and
tribal
immunity
from
suit,
like
the
united
states'
immunity
from
suit,
or
a
state's
immunity
from
suit,
is
about
enforcement
jurisdiction.
it's
about
amenability
to
suit
in
another
sovereign's
courts.
now--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
it
rests
on
something
that
is...
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
the
tribes
were
created
as
sovereign,
they
have
sovereignty.
now,
that
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
that
because
the
court
has
recognized
the
tribes
are
sovereigns,
and
because
immunity
from
suit
is
such
a
central
part
of
the
inherent
background
of
the
rule
of
sovereignty...
and
we
see
this
in
cases
like
couer
d'alene,
we
see
it
in
cases
under
the
eleventh
amendment
before
the
states,
we
see
it
in
cases
involving
the
united
states.
those
principles
of
sovereign
immunity
aren't
written
down
somewhere.
they
are
simply
part,
a
constitutive
part
of
our
law.
they
are
not
the
kind
of
common
law--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
let
me
make
two
points
about
that
in
reverse
order.
as
to
foreign
nations,
it
does
not
exist
in
the
commercial
context
because
congress
has
passed
a
statute
that
addresses
that,
and
may
i
just
revert
to
the
prior
argument
of
my
colleague
by
pointing
out
that
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
congress
was
able
to
consider
the
problem
holistically
and
to
address
issues
like
forum.
there's
automatic
removal
for
a
foreign
sovereign
to
federal
court,
like
enforcement.
there
are
provisions
about
what
property
of
the
sovereign
you
can
attach
for
a
judgment,
and
issues
like
damages.
there
are
limitations
on
the
kind
of
damages
that
apply.
now,
as
to
states,
first
of
all
there's
a
bit
of
a
canard
going
around
that
state
sovereignty
doesn't
exist
any
more,
but
that's
only
as
the
states
have
waived
it,
and
in
nevada
v.
hall
the
court
recognized
that
some
of
those
waivers
are
very
limited,
and
those
apply
to
the
court...
the
state's
own
courts.
now,
as
to
nevada
v.
hall
itself,
that
rests
on
a
premise
that
the
states
were
independent
sovereigns
when
they
went
into
the
compact
of
the
constitution,
and
the
court
found
nothing
in
the
constitution
that
purported
to
give
away
each
state's
right
to
subject
another
sister
state
to
its
own
jurisdiction,
but
what
the
states
did
give
away
was
their
ability
to
regulate
indian
affairs
and
their
ability
to
regulate
indian
tribes.
that
became
a
matter
of
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction.
i
think
that's
pellucid
under
the
court's
cases.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
again,
regulatory
power
has
to
be
distinguished,
but
i
think
it
is
true
with
respect
to
jurisdiction,
and
the
tribal
immunity
from
suit,
and
what
that
effectively
did
was
to
freeze
into
place
a
federal
common
law
rule
which,
nevada
v.
hall
recognized
that
if
you
had
looked
at
that
rule
at
the
time
of
the
constitution
you
would
have
said
that
every
state
would
recognize
immunity
for
every
other
state.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
think
that's
not
correct,
for
all
the
reasons
that
were
stated
in
the
opinion
in
potawatomi,
which
is
to
say
that
there
may
be
damage
actions
or
injunctive
actions
against--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i'm
sorry,
against
tribal
officers.
there
may
be
actions
against
officers,
there's
always
the
potential
for
agreement
with
the
tribe--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
simply
have
to
suggest
that
if
that
were
the
controlling
principle,
then
the
result
in
potawatomi
would
have
been
otherwise.
it
would
also
have
been--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
i
think
it's
very
instructive
that
when
congress
applied
parts
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
and
the
constitution
to
indian
tribes
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act
the
court
has
held
that
it
clearly
thought
about
this
issue
and
decided
that
damage
actions
were
not...
against
the
tribe
were
not
an
appropriate
means
of
resolution,
so
it
specifically
withheld
jurisdiction
to
enter...
even
under
a
federal
law
to
enter
money
judgments
against
the
tribe,
and
the
same
principle
applies
here,
that
you
have
to
protect
these
small
governments.
the
same
functional
reasons
that
supported
immunity
for
state
governments
when
they
were
smaller
and
more
vulnerable
than
they
are
now
still
support
that
immunity
for
indian
tribes.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
i
would
suggest
that,
for
instance,
there
are
a
variety
of
federal
laws
that
clearly
impose
mandatory
federal
law
obligations
on
the
states
and
state
officers,
and
yet
they
are
not...
the
state
is
not
amenable
to
a
private
suit
in
federal...
even
in
federal
court
to
enforce
those
obligations.
it's
exactly
the
same
distinction.
sometimes
you
have
a
right,
but
you
need
to
go
to
the
sovereign's
own
forum
to
enforce
it,
or
you
need
to
go
to
congress
to
try
to
get
something
done
about
it.
there
are
problems
that
are
inherent
in
sovereign
immunity,
and
that,
i
think,
is
recognized
in
the
three
affiliated
tribes
decision.
sometimes
you
will
end
up
with
a
result,
if
you
are
suing
a
sovereign,
which
will
perhaps
seem
unfair.
that
is...
it
is
an
ineluctable
aspect
of
the
tribe's
sovereign
immunity,
and
as
long
as
we're
going
to
recognize
that
immunity,
that
may
be
true.
now,
if
there
are
valid
policy
arguments,
and
i
think
there
may
be,
for
adjusting
this
situation,
then
they
are
the
province
of
congress,
and
congress
has
been
apprised
of
them
and
is
actively
considering
them.
thank
you.
