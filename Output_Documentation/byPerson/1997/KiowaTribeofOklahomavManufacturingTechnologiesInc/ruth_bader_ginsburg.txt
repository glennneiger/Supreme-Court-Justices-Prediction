but
then
you're
distinguishing
the
tribes
as
sovereign
from
a
sister
state
as
sovereign,
from
a
foreign
nation
as
sovereign.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
what
was
going
on
with
the
tate
letter?
before
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
courts
were
recognizing
that
there
were
occasions
where
the
sovereign
was
not
immune,
and
congress
had
passed
no
legislation.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
state
department
is
not
congress.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dumont,
those
principles
have
changed,
at
least
with
respect
to
sister
states,
and
with
respect
to
foreign
countries,
so
you
are
now
urging
a
kind
of
sovereign
immunity
that
doesn't...
no
longer
exists
state-to-state
or
foreign
nation
vis-a-vis
the
united
states.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dumont,
there's
one
justice
of
this
court
that
said,
if
there's
jurisdiction
to
regulate,
and
specifically
jurisdiction
to
tax,
then
of
course
there
must
be
jurisdiction
to
enforce
that
tax.
that
was
the
international
shoe
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
until
congress
says
otherwise.
i
thought
the
united
states
was
taking
the
position
that
it's
the
peculiar
relationship
of
trust
between
the
united
states
and
the
tribes
that
gives
them
this
kind
of
unusual
dependent
sovereignty,
not
really
the
kind
of
sovereign...
sovereignty
that
a
sister
state
or
a
foreign
nation
would
have,
but
a
dependent,
depending
on
the
united
states.
