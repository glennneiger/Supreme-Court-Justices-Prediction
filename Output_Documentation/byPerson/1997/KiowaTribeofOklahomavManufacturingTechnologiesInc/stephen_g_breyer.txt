justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is...
if
the...
suppose
the
tribe
goes
downtown
tulsa
and
they
buy
a
piece
of
property
and
open
an
office,
and
the
taxes
are
[dollars]
4,000
a
year,
and
they
don't
pay,
right.
can
the
city
or
the
state
sue
the
tribe
and
get
the
taxes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes...
they
buy
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
fine.
what
is
the
theory
under
which
oklahoma
can
get
the
taxes
for
the
property
but
cannot
get
the
rent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
think
oklahoma
cannot
collect
the
taxes,
either.
i
mean,
what
i'm
trying
to
do
is,
i
want
to
understand
the
theory
of
sovereign
immunity
under
which...
or,
what
is
the
case?
there
are
a
lot
of
possibilities.
maybe
they
have
oil
bubbling
up
underneath
in
the
basement,
violating
environmental
laws.
can
you
get
an
injunction?
what
about
a
fine?
what
about
taxes,
and
what
about
the
rent?
what's
the
theory
of
the
sovereign
immunity
for
the
indian
tribe
that
says
which
of
those
they
can
get,
which
they
can't,
and
why?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
particular,
what
is
the
default
rule?
is
it
the
case
that
if
they
rent
a
building
in
downtown
tulsa,
they
don't...
there's
no
way
to
collect
taxes?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
say
the
indian
tribe
in
your
view.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
the
answer
is
they
cannot
sue
to
get
the
money
from
the
tribe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
they
sue
to
get
the...
can
they
sue
to
enforce
the
environmental
regulation?
that
is
to
say,
can
they
bring
an
injunction
against
the
tribe
so
that
the
oil
isn't
bubbling
up
from
the
basement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
all
these...
there's
a
state
law
that
says
you
can't
keep
owls
in
the
basement,
or
you
can't
keep...
you
can't
have
holes
for
the
coyotes,
whatever.
i
mean,
there
can
be
a
million
different
state
laws,
and
they
want
to
bring...
a
state
environmental
law
is
violated
and
they
want
to
bring
an
injunction
to
prevent
it.
can
the
state
do
that,
enjoin
the
tribe
to
keep
the
building
according
to
whatever
the
state
law
is,
a
reasonable
state
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
even
though
it's
in
downtown...
so
in
fact,
an
officer
of
the
tribe
is
driving
a
tribe
truck,
and
he
speeds.
can
they
stop
him?
i
mean,
he's
driving
a...
it's
a
tribal
business
in
downtown--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this
true
in
anti-discrimination
legislation,
too?
if
the
tribe
does
business
they
don't
have
to
live
up
to
any
of
that,
insofar
as
there
could
be
monetary
judgments
or
injunctions
to
enforce.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
is
to
say,
if
there's
anything
to...
maybe
there's
no
sovereign
immunity,
but
if
there's
any
sovereign
immunity,
wouldn't
it
at
least
at
its
heart
be
there
to
protect
the
treasury
in
a
contract
suit
from
money
damages,
and
if
that's
so,
why
does
it
matter?
what's
the
principle
on
which
it
matters
whether
that
commercial
activity
that
led
to
the
effort
to
get
money
from
the
tribal
treasury,
what's
the
difference
whether
it
took
place
on
or
off?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
that's
true,
so
that's
why
i
ask.
i
mean,
that
happens
to
be
the
history,
so
why...
in
terms
of
the...
of
a
sovereign
immunity
principle,
wouldn't
contractual
damages
be
at
its
heart,
and
what
could
the
reason
be...
what
reason
that's
related
to
sovereign
immunity
could
there
be
for
saying
that
the
place
of
a
contract
makes
a
difference?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
it
your
view,
too...
you
also
have
asserted
what
i
call
an
all-or-nothing
position
that
once
the
tribe...
there
are
a
lot
of
different
kinds
of
laws.
there
are
state
discrimination
laws.
there
are
state
environmental
laws.
there
are
state
property
tax
laws.
there
are
state
tort
laws.
there
are
state
contract
laws.
is
it
your
view
that
once
the
tribe
goes
off
the
reservation,
the
state,
or
a
private
person,
where
appropriate,
could
bring
a
lawsuit
in
a
state
court
against
the
tribe
and
there's
no
assertion
of
sovereign
immunity
possible
for
all
those
things,
or
for
some?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the...
you
and
the
solicitor
general
agree
that
either
you
can
bring
a
lawsuit
against
the
tribe
acting
off-reservation
under
all
these
laws
or
under
none
of
them,
and
you
say
you
can
bring
the
suit
irrespective,
and
they
say
none.
you
say
all,
they
say
none.
is...
am
i
right?
is
that
what
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
potawatomi...
you're
more
familiar...
i
looked
at
it
quickly,
but...
or
is
there
some
other
precedent
that
makes
clear
that
in
the
noncontract
context,
say
the
state
regulatory
law
context,
or
the
state
tax
context,
that
the
state
or
a
city
or
some
private
person
can
maintain
a
lawsuit
and
collect
money
from
the
tribe,
or
didn't
potawatomi
leave
that
open?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that...
but
you...
there
is
no
authority,
i
take
it,
either
way
in
respect
to
any
of
these
laws
for
tribe
activity,
in
respect
to
any
of
these
laws
off
the
reservation,
any
category,
which
makes
clear
that
the
state
or
a
city
or
a
private
person
can
sue
the
tribe,
or
that
makes
clear
it
can't
sue
the
tribe.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
clear
authority
either
way
on
that,
i
take
it.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is...
but
i'm
beginning
to...
i
hadn't
seen
fully
the
implications
for
tax
law,
regulatory
law,
all
kinds
of
other
laws,
and
if
there
are...
i'm
not
certain
they've
been
fully
argued
out,
because
you've
been
focusing
on
contract.
does
it
make
sense,
then,
to
say
the
state
was
wrong
in
going
on
state
law
and
then
permit
this
thing
to
be
argued
more
fully
where
all
these
implications
are
explored?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
i'm
thinking...
i
think
perhaps
the
lower
court
said
it
was
state
law,
and
perhaps
it's
wrong
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
it's
wrong
on
that,
i
wonder
if
we
shouldn't
send
it
back.
i...
that's...
rather
than
try
to
go
into
this
very
broad
question,
well
beyond
contract
law
that's
at
stake
here.
