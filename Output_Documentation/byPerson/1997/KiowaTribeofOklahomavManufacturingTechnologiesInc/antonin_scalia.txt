justice
antonin
scalia
well,
suppose
there
had
been
a
waiver,
would
you
think
that
these
actions
could
then
have
been
undertaken?
i
mean,
when
the
federal
government
waives
its
sovereign
immunity
i
don't
think
that
means
that
whoever
gets
the
judgment
can
move
in
and
cart
off
money
from
the
federal
treasury.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
suppose
they
didn't.
i
mean,
i
would
be
just
as
concerned
about
the
effects
that
you're
concerned
about
here
in
that
situation
where
there
was
a
waiver,
without
saying
anything
about
what
you
can
do
to
the
tribe
to
enforce
the
liability.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
certainly
not
the
case,
i
am
sure,
with
regard
to
foreign
sovereign
immunity
under
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act,
where
a
foreign
sovereign
is
liable
for
its
commercial
activities--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
i'm
quite
sure
that
even
when
there's
been
no
waiver
what
you
can
do
is,
if
the
foreign
sovereign
has
a
bank
account
in
this
country,
you
can
move
against
the
bank
account,
period.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
of
course
they
can
assume
that,
because
we
have
cases
that
have
said
that,
but
let
me
ask
this.
if
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
had
not
been
passed,
do
you
think
that
this
court
could
by
judicial
decision
have
adopted
as
part
of
our
domestic
law
of
foreign
sovereign
immunity
the
commercial
acts
exception,
which
have
become
almost
uniform
in
international
law?
do
you
think
we
would
have
had
to
wait
for
congress
to
pass
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
before
we
could
revise
our
jurisprudence
on
sovereign
immunity
to
comport
with
the
new
international
understanding?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
would
have
had
to
wait
for
congress?
justice
antonin
scalia
officers
have
no
money.
i
mean,
the
tribe
has
collected
all
of
this
tax
money
and
hasn't
turned
it
over
to
the
state,
billions
of
dollars,
and
they're
going
to
sue
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--tribal
officer
for
millions
of
dollars?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
usually
takes
two
to
engage
in
commercial
activity,
doesn't
it?
i
mean,
can
a
tribe
force
anybody
to
enter
into
commercial
arrangements
with
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
then,
the
rule
you're
arguing
for
really
is
not...
is
not
a...
analogous
to
the
rule
in
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
at
all.
i
mean,
if
you
have
a
foreign
sovereign
that
engages
in
commercial
activities,
even
if
the
company
that
it
sets
up
enters
its
contracts
at
home,
there
would
still
be
liability
for
the
commercial
activities,
wouldn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
really
appeal
to
the
change
in
sovereign
immunity
internationally,
or
the
provisions
of
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
as
exemplifying
what
you
would
want
us
to
do.
you
want
us
to
create
some
new
kind
of
exemption
from
sovereign
immunity,
one
that
only
applies
when
you're
acting
outside
your
own
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
you,
do
you
just
so...
i
don't
mind
you
saying
all
of
this,
but
so
long
as
you
get
around
to
answering
my
question.
do
you
agree
that
the
foreign
sovereign
immunities
act
and
the
international
concept
of
commercial
liability
for
sovereigns
does
not
work
the
way
the
principle
you're
urging
on
us
would
work?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
if
france
sets
up
an
aircraft
company
and
it's
a
purely
commercial
venture,
profit-making
venture,
but
all
the
shares
are
owned
by
the
state
of
france,
the
nation
of
france,
that
if
that
company
makes
a
contract,
so
long
as
it
makes
the
contract
in
france
the
commercial
activities
exception
to
sovereign
immunity
does
not
apply?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
mm-hmm.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
if
conducted
the
commercial
activities
on
its
reservation.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that's
different
from
the
international
rule,
isn't
it?
