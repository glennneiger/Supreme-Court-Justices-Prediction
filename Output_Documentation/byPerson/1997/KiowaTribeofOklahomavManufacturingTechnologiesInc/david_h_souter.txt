justice
david
h.
souter
in
so
holding
was
the
oklahoma
court
in
effect
accepting
the
invitation...
maybe
that's
too
strong
a
word,
at
least
the
suggestion
in
the,
what
was
it,
the
cabazon
case
that
in
fact
that
might
be
the
case.
didn't
this
court
suggest
that
that
might
be
possible?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
why
was
the
suggestion
ill-taken?
why
was
the
oklahoma
court
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
that
is
entirely...
but
that...
as
i
understand
it,
your
argument
rests
entirely
upon
a
rule
of
prudence,
self-administered
by
this
court,
that
we
will
not
revise
or
consider
revising
the
traditional
rule,
and
i'm
not
sure
why
we
should
be
bound
by
that
rule
of
prudence.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
we
developed
this
rule
at
a
time
when
the
kinds
of
problems
that
are
being
hypothesized
in
this
argument
really
would
not
have
been
realistic
hypotheses.
now
they
are
realistic
hypotheses.
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
concede
that
the
issue
is
a
federal
law
issue,
not
a
state
law
issue?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
were
federal
law
principles
decided
below?
in
other
words,
if
we
were
to
accept
your
suggestion
that
we
affirm
based
on
federal
law,
wouldn't
we
be
making
a
judgment
about
or
a
decision
about
federal
law
which
has
not
been
made
by
a
lower
court
in
this
case?
in
other
words,
we
would
not
be
reviewing,
we
would
be
taking
up
a
question
in
the
first
instance,
wouldn't
we?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
i
understand
you...
you
correct
me
if
i
wrong.
if
i
understand
it,
the
court
was,
as
it
were,
informed
by
that
case
in
making
a
state
law
judgment.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
can
understand...
i
guess
i
can
understand
what
you're
saying,
but
i
don't
understand
the
justification
for
it.
let
me
ask
basically
the
same
kind
of
question
that
justice
breyer
asked,
but
in
a
different
way.
one
way
of
looking
at
sovereign
immunity
is
to
look
at
it
as
a
doctrine
about
the
relationship
between
sovereign
a
and
sovereign
b
whose
courts
assert
judicial
jurisdiction
over
sovereign
a.
why
should
the
policy
that
says
their
relationship
is
such
that
b's
courts
should
not
have
jurisdiction
over
a,
why
should
the
doctrine
that
embodies
that
relationship
depend
for
its
application
on
whether
a
contract
was
made
on
a
piece
of
trust
land,
or
in
downtown
tulsa?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
that...
historically
that
is
certainly
true
with
respect...
i
guess
it's
certainly
true
with
respect
to
legislative
or
regulatory
jurisdiction,
but
we're
now
talking
about
judicial
jurisdiction,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it...
anything
follows
with
respect
to
judicial
jurisdiction.
