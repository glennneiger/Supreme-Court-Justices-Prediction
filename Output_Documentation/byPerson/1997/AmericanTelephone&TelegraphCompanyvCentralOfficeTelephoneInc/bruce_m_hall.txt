mr.
bruce
m.
hall
yes,
your
honor.
we
sued
under
diversity.
may
it
please
the
court...
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
we
say
that
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
affirmed
on
three
separate
grounds,
one
of
which
is
the
competitive
relationships
between
the
two
companies
under
which
the
inter...
pardon
me,
the
intentional
interference
claim
was
filed,
and
the
second
one
is
that
the
savings
clause
in
the
federal
communications
act
saves
the
interference
claim
and
saves
our
claim
for
wilful
misconduct.
and
our
third
reason,
argument
is
that
the
tariff
itself
expressly
provides
for
the
action
that
we
brought.
that
particular
section
has
not
been
mentioned
so
far
in
the
discussions.
the
competitor
claims--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--that
is
not
raised
here
as
an
issue,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
there
are
two
causes
of
action
here,
your
honor.
one
of
them,
the
intentional
interference,
is
simply
totally
outside
of
the
tariff
and
is
preserved
by
the
savings
clause
and
then
separately
from
that
it's
simply
not
within
the
cognizance
of
the
communications
act,
the
relationships
between
these
two
competitors.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
your
honor,
we
have
made
the
assumption,
and
i
believe
that
at&t
has
made
the
statement
to
the
fcc
to
the
same
effect,
that
wilful
misconduct
is
fully...
can
be
sued
under,
and
it
is
2.3.1
of
the
tariff.
it
is
the
section...
it
is
the
lead
section
of
the
tariff.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
this
has
been--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--that
is
true,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
our
third--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
on
this
instance,
as
counsel
mentioned
to
your
honor,
they
did
not
ask
for
a
referral.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
i
think
the
judge
felt
that
the
common
law
claims
were
well
within
his
cognizance
and
the
wilfulness
conduct
claim
which
we
say
is
under
the
filed
tariff
itself,
it
is
authorized
by
203
(a),
which
as
the
filing
of
the
tariff
becomes
the
law,
201...
pardon
me,
2.3.1,
which
is
the
wilful
misconduct
cause
of
action,
if
you
will--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
wilful--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--definitely
not
that,
your
honor.
that
would
be
rate,
or
rate-affecting,
and
we...
our
lawsuit--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--is
not
rate
or
rate-affecting.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
no.
we
read
into
that--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--that
it
must
not
be
rate-affecting
as
well,
because
we
know
the
cases
like
marco,
where
you
had
a
collision
between
wilful
misconduct
and
misrepresentation
of
rates.
this
is
not
a
misrepresentation
of
rates
case,
or
rate-related,
in
our
view,
and
counsel
has
mentioned,
i
believe,
that
the
fcc
might
perhaps
give
guidance
on
these
nontariffed
items.
it
hasn't
done
so.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
there's
quite
a
body
of,
i
guess
you'd
call
it
negotiation
in
this
area
already,
your
honor.
i'm
doing
my
arguments
in
reverse
now,
but
in
any
event,
the
amici
for
us
have
come
in,
the
large
users,
and
put
into
their
index
a
great
number...
they
can't,
because
of
confidentiality,
go
into
the
details
of
those
contracts,
but
they
have
put
in
a
large
number
of
subject
areas
which
are
exactly
the
subject
areas
that
we're
talking
about
in
our
particular
case.
at&t
at
page
35
of
its
opening
brief
went
into
the
same
kind
of
listings
of
things
that
are
associated
with
tariff
items,
or
a
part
of...
they
called
them
the
details
a
minute
ago,
that
are
all
part
and
parcel
of
it,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
we
have
in
our
own
case
where
we
went
back
after
the
amicus
brief
and...
these
are
er.
these
are
in
the
record,
but
they
were
not
in
my
briefing,
and
simply
looked
at
what
at&t
gave
us
when
we
signed
up
for
a
software-defined
network.
this
is
all
part
of
what
the
court
instructed
was
going
to
be
part
of
the
contract
for
these
people
to...
the
jury
to
work
on.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
your
honor,
maybe
if
we
had
the
fcc
guidelines
type
of
situation
with
the
robinson-patman
act,
but
here
we
have...
the
fcc
doesn't
even
want
the
filed
tariff
doctrine
any
more,
and
i
don't
think
as
a
practical
matter
we'd
have
much
luck.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
yes,
your
honor.
under
our...
under
2.3.1,
that
takes
its
direct
authority
from
202(a)
as
the
filing
requirement,
and
20...
2.3.1,
which
says
the
liability,
if
any,
of
at&t
for
its
wilfulness
conduct
is
not
limited
by
this
tariff,
and
to
us,
that
was
extremely
clear
language.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
yes,
your
honor,
but
this
would
render
obligatory
the
2.3.1.
it
is
a
separate
cause.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
that
is
part
of
the
tariff,
your
honor,
which
has
the
authority
of
2.
--203
(a).
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
it
didn't
repeal
it,
your
honor.
it
simply
gave,
under
the
right
of
203(a),
wilful
misconduct
to
the
customer
as
a
way
of
seeking
redress.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
again,
your
honor,
we
are
saying,
and
we
have
said--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--that
is
a
state
law
claim,
your
honor,
which
was
brought
under
the
savings
clause
and--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
your
honor,
we
are
saying
two
things
about
our
intentional
claim.
first
of
all,
we're
saying
intentional
claim
is
separate
from
the
communications
act.
it's
simply
not
within
its
purview.
it's
not
the
kind
of
a
thing,
the
customer
relationship,
that
the
communications
act
addresses.
this
is
between
competitors.
this...
the...
i
believe
the
court
has
probably
seen
in
our
opening
brief
where
we
had
to
state
our
position
of
facts
quite
differently
from
at&t,
is
that
we
had
a
very
classic
intentional
interference
claim
where
they
wished
to
put
us
out
of
business,
and
where--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--your
honor,
that
one,
we
cited
to
you
some
antitrust
cases,
and
two
of
those
antitrust
cases
that
we
cited...
these
are
in
the
circuits...
city
of
kirkwood
and
city
of
groton,
were
ones
where
there
were
price
squeezes,
where
the
municipality
had
its
price
squeezed
by
the--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--i
was
trying
to
answer
your
question,
your
honor,
only
to
say
that
the...
that
those
issues
have
been
considered.
that
is
not
in
our
case,
however.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
i
don't
think
we
would
win,
your
honor,
but
we
would
certainly
cite
those
two
cases
i
just
mentioned
to
you,
because
they
do
tend
to
support
our
position.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
both.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
it...
i
think
it
is
also
supported
by
morales--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--v.
twa.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
under--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
if
i
understood
your
correction...
your
question
correctly,
your
honor,
the
antitrust
claims
that
we
cited
did
survive
the
communications
act
and
filed
rate
doctrine
objections.
these
were
communications
act
cases
in
one
instance.
the
other
kinds
of
claims
that
are...
that
involve
us
also
go
under
414.
they
go
under
the
general
competition
viewpoint
that
let
those
antitrust
cases
go
because
they
were
not
within
the
purview
of
the
communications
act,
and
we
believe
that's
a
strong
separate
basis.
in
the
ninth
circuit
there
was
a
cooperative
communications
case
mentioned
by
both
the
dissent
and
the
majority.
that
one
was
one
in
which
the
minority
praised
the
case,
or
the
result,
which
was
under
the...
414
and
also
because
it
was
an
independent
competitor
claim.
under
both
instances
it
was
free
from
the
filed
rate
doctrine
and
the
problems
that
we
had
in
the
court
below.
but
what
had
happened
was,
it
didn't...
the
dissent
did
not
recognize
that
we,
too,
are
a
competitor
just
as
counsel
advised
the
court
just
a
moment
ago.
we're
a
competitor
just
as
much
as
the
cooperative
communication
case
that
the
dissent
approved.
we
have
under
414...
you
were
mentioning
nader.
in
the
later
case
of
twa
v.
morales,
in
that
particular
case
there
was
an
amendment,
the
airline
deregulation
act,
to
the
faa,
and
under
that
one
the
court
found
a
very
strong
preemption
and
strong
related-to
language.
under
both
of
those
approaches,
the
state
ag's
efforts
to
regulate
went
out
the
window,
and
the
court
said
in
that
particular
case
in
citing
nader
that
the
pre-1978
faa,
nader...
pardon
me,
the
state
ag's
would
have
been
able
to
do
exactly
what
they
did
do,
or
tried
to
do,
i
should
have
said.
and
also,
they
added
on
that
the
states
could
have
regulated
intrastate
rates
of
these
carriers,
and
even
the
rates
of
interstate
carriers
that
were
intrastate,
so
that
was
a
very
strong
case,
and
they
relied
upon
the
savings
clause
of
the
prior
act,
of
the
faa
act.
that
savings
clause
is
word-for-word
the
same
clause
that
we
have
in
the
federal
communications
act.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
there,
your
honor,
i
guess
our
answer
to
that
has
been
that
we
can't
understand
how
attempting
to
put
somebody
out
of
business
and
wilful
misconduct
which
included
a
mess
of
dirty
tricks
relates
to
the
purposes
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
again,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--we
go
back
to
the
really
quite
a
large
body
of
work
we
have
in
this
particular
case
where
we
have
the...
our
amici,
at&t
itself
at
various
parts
of
its
brief,
in
the
materials
i
indicated
to
the
court
that
we
received,
we
have
a
large
body
of,
if
not
law,
of
business
practice
occurring
now
where
a
huge
amount
is
not
under
the
direct
tariff
language.
nobody
can
tell
a
carrier
what
it
puts
into
the
tariff.
they
may
put
in
nonrate-affecting
materials
in
there,
so
you
have
to
look
at
everything
to
see
whether
they
are
or
are
not
rate-affecting,
and--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--pardon
me.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
excuse
me,
justice
stevens.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
no.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
we
suggested
they
do,
but
they
didn't
respond.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
your
honor,
they
are...
it's
a
strange
mix,
and
i
will
tell
you
one
of
the
reasons
why,
is
that
at
the
trial
the
at&t
tariff
expert
said
that
provisioning
and
billing,
which
are
a
large
part
of
what
we're
talking
about
here,
are
not
in
the
tariff,
and
that
has
not
helped
us
make
a...
this
fine
distinction
here.
we
have...
in
our
pretrial
order
we
listed
the
kinds
of
acts,
and
that's
in
the
j.a.
we
listed
the
kinds
of
acts
that
we're
complaining
about,
many
of
which
would
square
off
against
tariff
provisions
and
many
of
which
would
not.
a
suppressed
billing
would
not.
deliberately
trying
to
keep
us
from
getting
any
cash
would
not.
slamming,
counsel
just
agreed,
would
not.
misappropriation
of
our
customers
would
not.
so
we
felt
that
the
wilfulness
misconduct
meant
a
lot
more
than
going
down
the
line
of
individual
numbers
below
that
to
see
what
the
breaches
were.
we
felt
that
wilful
misconduct,
under
state
law,
which
is
the
usual
referral,
meant
a
lot
more
than
that
just
as
intentional
interference
does.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
some
of
these
were
much
more,
what
would
be
commonly
called
intentional
interference
type
actions.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
my--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
we
know
that
we're
all
presumed
to
know
the
tariff,
even
though
we
don't,
and
that
was
another--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--we--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--we...
we're
paying
the
rate.
there's
no
question
about
that.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
rates
affecting...
i
mean,
services
affecting
rates
under
the
federal
communications
act,
which
makes
a
big
difference,
and
there
were
a
lot
that
at&t
says
in
this
courtroom
and
has
said
in
its
briefing,
and
the
amici
have
said,
do
not
affect
rates,
and
most
of
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
that
we
are
certain
does
not
affect
rates
and
it's
been
mentioned
before
about
this
mlb
labo
network
comment
in
the
at&t
brief,
where
they
said
that
while
these
may
have
value
there's
no
charge
for
them.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
that,
your
honor,
leads
to
another
conundrum
within
this
language
we
have
here.
at&t
said
in
its
tariff
that
labo
was
available.
that's
another
one
of
these
accounts,
location
account
billing,
and
lo
and
behold
we,
when
we
went
into
contract
with
them,
were
put
on
labo,
not
mlb
and
not
network.
we
were
put
on
labo.
labo,
under
their
tariff,
is
impermissible
to
us.
it's
for
franchised
operations
where
there's
common
ownership.
they
stuck
us
into
labo
and
that,
i
think
justice
ginsburg
mentioned,
all
the
funds
then
went
to
our
end
users
and
left
us
to
fight
it
out
with
them,
one
of
the
many
reasons
we
lost
all
of
our
accounts.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
that
was
a
violation
of
the
tariff.
at
the
same
time--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--you
could,
but
it's
also
a
part
of
wilful
misconduct
if
it's
intentional
and
if
it's
a
part
of
all
of
these
other
things
i've
been
mentioning.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
your
honor,
i
think
that
any...
you
have
to
prove
wilful
misconduct,
but
it's
a
separate
matter
and
it
has
equal
dignity.
we've
mentioned
the
primrose
case
from
this
court
in
1894,
where
this
court
said
you
have
to...
you,
utilities,
have
to
provide
for
liability
for--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--and
so
long
as
they
are
not
rate-affecting.
i'm
ready
to--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--can
certainly
concede
that.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
that's...
we've
always
said
that,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
yes.
we
have
to
make
that
analysis
of
it,
and
i'm
sorry
if
i
didn't
say
it
correctly,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
yes.
there
are
many
things
that
were...
that
are
not
rate-affecting
in
a
tariff.
the
tariff...
they
are
required
to
put
what
is
rate-affecting
in
the
tariff,
but
they
go
down
and
file
thousands
of
tariffs.
they
can
put
nonrate-affecting
things
in
there
just
as
easily
as
rate-affecting
if
it
serves
their
purposes.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
justice
ginsburg,
again
i
have
to...
the
real
world
that
has
been
shown
here
in
the
evidence
by
both
sides,
i've
cited
page
35
of
their
opening
brief
and
13
and
14
of
their
closing
brief,
all
the
materials
that
were
submitted
by
the
amici,
and
those
of
our
own,
in
the
actual
working
world
they
all
accept
these
as
part
of...
gap-fillers,
as
they
call
them,
or
details,
as
it
was
called
by
counsel,
as
part
of
the
tariff.
those
are
not
antithetical
with
it.
they're
consistent
with
the
tariff.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
okay.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
your
honor,
at&t
made
no
effort
at
trial
to
make
any
such
distinctions.
i'll
come
back
to
that
in
just
a
second,
because
i
also
want
to
say
that
at&t
at
trial
made
no
such
arguments
as
they're
making
here
today
that
there
were
preferences,
that
there
were
rebates
and
so
forth.
there's
an
absolutely
silent
record
on
that.
in
the
intentional
interference
claim
that
we
filed,
if...
the
pre-trial
order
is
in
the
j.a.,
and
in
that,
your
honor,
you
will
find
that
they
raise
the
defense
of
commercial
privilege
or
comparative
privilege
alone,
no
such
thing
as
filed
rate
doctrine
defense.
when
they
requested
instructions
for
the
judge
to
give,
they
did
not
ask
for
any
instruction
that
the
filed
rate
doctrine
opposed
the
intentional
interference
claim.
it
doesn't.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
the
united...
the
ninth
circuit
said
more
than
it
should
have
there,
your
honor,
because
it
simply
overlooked
our
position.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
at
the
trial,
your
honor...
i'm
merely
pointing
out
that
intentional
interference--
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
--is
that
under
intentional
interference,
your
honor?
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
i
may
have
misspoken
myself,
but
i'm
awfully
certain
that
under
the
intentional
interference
claim
they
did
not
raise
the
filed
rate
doctrine.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
reserving
that,
we
thoroughly
believe
we
have
the
right
to
file
an
intentional
interference
claim
and
if
it
weren't
linked
to
this
other
one
we
wouldn't
even
be
here
today,
in
our
opinion.
but
secondly,
your
honor,
as
a
practical
matter,
going
to
the...
taking
the
referral
and
coming
to
washington,
d.c.
from
portland,
oregon
is
a
big
financial
matter.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
that
seems
to
be
their
argument.
mr.
bruce
m.
hall
well,
i
would
simply
say,
your
honor,
that
the
ones
that
we
cite
at
the
very
beginning
of
our
case,
of
our
answering
brief,
responding
brief,
suggest
that
a
number
of
these
have
gone
forward
despite
the
communications
act
and
filed
rate
doctrine.
