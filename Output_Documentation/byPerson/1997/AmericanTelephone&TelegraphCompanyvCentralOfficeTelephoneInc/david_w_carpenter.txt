mr.
david
w.
carpenter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
held
that
the
statutory
filed
tariff
requirements,
here
codified
in
section
203
of
the
communications
act,
apply
only
to
rates
and
not
to
the
services
provided
in
exchange
for
those
rates.
the
answer
to
this
question
is
that
the
holding
is
simply
wrong.
the
statutory
terms
are
not
limited
to
rates,
but
they
also
prohibit,
among
other
things,
any
untariffed
privilege
or
facility
in
communication
and
any
form
of
rebate,
and
this
court
has
held
many
times
that
it's
an
unlawful
rebate
and
preference
in
violation
of
these
prohibitions
for
a
carrier
to
provide
a
service
or
to
enforce
a
service
guarantee
that
is
not
covered
by
the
carrier's
tariff.
and
this
case
also
lacks
the
element
that
made
the
recent
maislin
and
mci
v.
att
cases
close
questions
in
this
court,
for
no
federal
agency
responsible
for
the
administration
of
these
requirements
has
ever
suggested
the
ninth
circuit's
interpretation,
much
less
endorsed
it
as
advancing
some
other
legitimate
statutory
goal.
the
reality
is,
is
that
in
situations
where
tariffing
requirements
have
applied
and
should
continue
to
apply,
and
the
federal
agencies
have
found
that
there
are
many,
the
ninth
circuit's
holding
would
create
the
very
discrimination
in
rates
that
everyone,
even
our
opponent,
concedes
to
be
the
purpose
of
this
requirement.
under
the
holding,
carriers
could
evade
the
prohibitions
not
by
misquoting
the
rates,
but
by
misquoting
the
service,
making
service
guarantees
that
aren't
in
the
tariff,
and
when
they're
breached
excusing
the
carrier
from
paying
tariff
charges
and
paying
an
amount
of
money
that
would
represent
the
damages
for
the
breach.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
your
honor.
there
was
no
claim
litigated
there
is
any
violation
of
those
provisions.
the
only
claims
that
were
litigated
is
that
it
was
a
state
law
breach
of
contract,
an
intentional
interference
with
tortious
relationships,
with
business
relationships
for
att
to
fail
to
provide
cot
with
the
quality
of
regulated
long
distance
service
that
cot
claimed
it
had
been
promised.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
there's
no
limitation
on
the
things
that
the
fcc
can
consider
in
deciding
whether
a
difference
in
treatment
is
unjust
and
unreasonable,
for
example,
for
purposes
of
the
prohibition
of
section
202(a)
of
the
communications
act.
similarly,
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
limitation
on
the
factors
that
it
could
consider
in
deciding
whether
something's
unjust
and
unreasonable--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--no,
that's
not...
that
is
not
our
position.
first,
there
are
a
whole
range
of
intentional
and
nonintentional
torts
that
don't
arise
out
of
the
carrier-customer
relationship
and
the
fortuity
that
someone
happens
to
be
our
customer
wouldn't
immunize
us
from
a
tort
action
if
that...
if
a
customer
were
a
victim
of
such
a
tort.
second,
with
respect
to
things
that
arise
out
of
the
customer-carrier
relationship,
we
are
under
a
series
of
duties
under
the
communications
act.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
absolutely,
if
it
involved
the
rates
that
we
charge
for
our
communications
service
or
the
obligations
that
we
incur
in
exchange
for
the
receipt
of
those
payments.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's...
that
would
be
entirely
legitimate,
but,
of
course,
the
federal
statute
has
to
be
interpreted
uniformly.
let
me
maybe
put
some
of
these
questions
to
rest
right
now.
if
at&t
had
deliberately
provided
cot,
other
resellers
with
service
that
was
inferior
in
quality
to
that
that
the
commercial
customers
had
received,
we
would
have
violated
202
of
the
communications
act
and
we
would
have
been
liable
to
it
for
the
damages
we
caused.
now,
those
damages
would
have
been
determined
under
the
federal
standards
of
the
act.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
either
place.
obviously,
the
suits
can
be
brought
either
place.
if
they're
a
question
of
the
dispute
over
the
scope
of
the
duty
it
could
be
referred
to
the
fcc
under
primary
jurisdiction,
but
those
suits
can
be
brought
in
either
the
federal
district
court
or
at
the
fcc.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
central
telephone
is
a
competitor.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
if
we
had
done
that
and
did
it
by
providing
it
with
worse
service
than
it
was
entitled
to
under
the
tariff,
under
201
of
the
communications
act,
or
202,
it
has
a
federal
damages
remedy,
but
that...
that--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it
has
no
state
law
remedy.
it
might
have
a
federal
antitrust
remedy
in
some
circumstance,
but
it
has
no
state
law
remedy
because
the
effect
of
that
is
to
give
them
a
preference
over
other
customers.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
let
me
suggest
something
for
your
consideration.
in
the
abilene
case,
in
1907,
landmark--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--abilene
case,
the
question
there
was
whether
a
state
law
that
had
the
identical
substantive
prohibitions
as
the
federal
statute
could
be...
could
be
applied
to
define
the
regulated
carrier's
obligation
to
its
customer.
the
court
said,
even
if
the
substantive
standards
are
the
same
it's
inevitable
that
different
states
will
apply
those
substantive
standards
in
different
ways,
and
that
would
defeat
the
uniformity
that
is
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
a
later
case
said
that
this
was
one
of
the
rare
cases
of
field
preemption,
where--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it
was
a
case
involving
whether
the
rates
were
just
and
reasonable.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
there
was
a
common
law
right
to
be
charged
only
a
reasonable
rate.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--your
honor,
an
intentional
tort
is
preempted
only
if
the
predicate
for
it
is,
is
that
the
customer
didn't
receive
the
quality
of
service
that
it
was
entitled
to
in
exchange
for
the
payment
of
the
tariffed
rate.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
absolutely,
your
honor.
they
could
have
sued
us
for
violation
of
the
tariff.
i
think
if
they
had
sued
us
on
that
basis
we
would
have
gotten
summary
judgment.
if
there
had
been
a
close
question--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--absolutely.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
absolutely.
i
don't
think
it's
the
case
that
the
tariff
could
have
been
invoked,
because
our
only
duty
is
to
make
reasonable
effort
at
the
due
date
we
meet
and
not
to...
and
to
allow
them
to
cancel
if
we
miss
it
by
more
than
45
days,
but
they
certainly
can
sue
us
whenever
we
make
a
service
guarantee
in
a
tariff
and
breach
it.
that--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--if
you
make
a
guarantee
involving
the
tariffed
service
it's
not
covered
by
the
tariff.
it's
invalid.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
there's
a
terminological
issue
there.
multilocation
billing
and
network
billing
are
two
different
options
that
we
give
customers.
they
are
different
ways--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--the
tariff...
the
tariff
doesn't
even
discuss...
what
the
tariff
does--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--the
tariff
obviously
requires
us
to
bill
them,
and
it
defines
our
obligations
in
billing
them.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
our
position...
it's
our
position
that
we
have
to
give
them
a
choice
of
one
of
those
two.
our
order
forms
gives
them
a
choice,
and
we
think--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
under
that
set
of
facts
i
would
read
the
obligation
to
provide
multilocation
billing
or
network
billing
into
the
tariff,
and
if
we
violated
the
obligation--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--as
defined
by
the
tariff
we'd
be
libel
to
them
in
damages.
in
this
instance--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--if
we
fail
to
provide
it,
it
is
our
best
efforts,
that
could
be
a...
that
could
be
a
violation--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it
would
state
a
violation
of
the
tariff,
and
then
the
question,
you
know,
would
be
under
the
limitation
liability
clause,
whether
it
was
wilful.
this...
it
so
happens
in
this
case
our
tariff
disclaims
any
responsibility
for
the
billing
obligation
that
they
want
to
read
into
the
tariff,
so
it's...
it's
answering
a
hypothetical
question.
in
this
case,
our
tariff
says
we
won't
do
what
they
said
we
should
have
done.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
just
let
me
clarify
one
thing
about
multilocation
billing.
our
tariff
doesn't
describe
any
of
the
details
about
how
we
bill
service
or
provision
service.
it
defines
our
obligations
in
doing
it
and
says
what
they
aren't.
our
obligations
aren't
to
allocate
charges
among
locations,
which
is
what
they
wanted
us
to
do.
our...
and
we
have...
there's
not
an
obligation
that
we
actually
render
accurate
bills.
obviously,
they
only
pay
us
what's
due,
but
if
we
render
an
inaccurate
bill
it
doesn't
excuse
anybody
from
paying
the
rates,
and
it
doesn't
give
anybody
a
right
to
damages,
and
it's
our...
we
have
implemented
this
obligation
by
giving
customers
a
choice
between
two
different
ways
of
billing
the
service,
and
it's
our
view
that
we
have
to...
we
honor
the
choice.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
we
could
have
certainly
put
in
the
tariff
that
the
customer
has
two
billing
options,
multilocation
billing
and
network
billing,
and
we
think
actually
our
tariff
should
be
construed,
given
that
we
have
these
order
forms
that
give
people
that
choice,
as
imposing
that
obligation
anyway.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
so
whatever
multilocation
billing
is
or
isn't,
it
is
not
a
case
where
we
are
assuming
the
obligation
to
allocate
charges
among
locations.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
suppose
there
would
be
two
ways
to
look
at
this,
and
i'm...
the
first,
which
i'm
not
going
to
advocate,
is
that
the
service
wasn't
authorized
by
the
tariff.
it
was
therefore
invalid.
that's
not
our
position.
our
position
is
that
it
was
permitted
under
the
tariff
so
long
as
it
didn't
constitute
an
allocation
of
charges
that
gave
them
a
right
not
to
pay
us,
or
to
sue
us
for
damages
if
we
didn't
do
it
accurately,
and
that's
their
claim
here.
one
thing
to
remember--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--their
claim
is
that
we
didn't
accurately
bill
their
customers
on
their
behalf.
the
tariff
said
we
won't
accurately
bill
your
customers
on
your
behalf,
and
the
fcc
regulations
say
that
that
is
a
service
that
we
can't
provide
in
exchange
for
payment
of
the
tariffed
rate.
the
fcc
has
defined
that
as
outside
the
scope
of
the
regulated
common
carrier
service
that
we
offer.
that's
something
that's
been
deregulated.
so
that...
this
is
a
situation
where
our
tariff
didn't
assume
the
obligation
that
they're
claiming,
and
in
which
the
fcc's
regulations
would
have
prevented
us
from
trying
to
put
the
service
that
they're
claiming
into
the
tariff.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no.
it
would
not
have
prevented
that,
but
it
would
have
had
to
be
a
separate
contract
for
a
separate
consideration.
it's...
judge
posner
had
a
wonderful
phrase--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--yes,
that
would
have
been
enforceable
in
state
court,
because
that
would
have
been
a
contract
for
an
unregulated
service
declared
by
the
fcc
to
be
outside
the
scope
of
common
carrier
communications
services.
that
would
be
a
like
a...
if
we
had
a
separate
contract,
to
quote
judge
posner,
to
sell
them
ugli
fruit
at
a
market
price,
that's
outside
the
common
carrier
relationship,
just
as
it
would
be
outside
the
common
carrier
relationship
if
we
committed
an
intentional
tort
like
libel,
and
the
fact
that
someone
happened
to
be
our
customer
wouldn't
immunize
us
from
a
libel
suit.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
it
does
obtain
if
the
intentional
interference
doesn't
arise
out
of
a
relationship
with
them
as
our
long
distance
customer,
so
if
we...
they
mention
something
here
called
slamming,
which
is
when
you
change
a
long
distance
customer
from
someone
else's
service
to
yours
without
authorization.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
a
classic
example
of
something
that
is
quite
independent
of
the
customer-carrier
relationship,
but
that
wasn't
the
basis
for
this
judgment
here.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes.
that
would
be
actionable
in
the
state
court.
that
would
be
actionable,
but
what's
not
actionable
in
the
state
court
are
claims
involving
the
rates
or
the
obligations
the
carrier
incurs
in
exchange
for
the
rates.
that's
what's
not
actionable,
and
the
proposition--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--all
right.
well,
let
me
respond
to
both.
when
slamming
occurs,
generally
the
carrier
that's
the
victim
isn't
your
customer.
mci
occasionally
changes
our
customers
to
it
when
they're
not
authorized,
so
that's
something
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact,
whether
two
carriers
happen
to
be
customers
of
one
another.
it's
entirely
independent.
it's
just
fortuitous
in
this
situation
that
in
the
two
incidents
of
slamming
that
occurred,
but
they
weren't
the
basis
for
this
judgment,
that
cot
happened
to
also
be
our
customer.
now,
with
respect
to
nader,
that
was
a
case,
there
was
no
filed
tariff
claim,
and
that
was
a
case
where
the
practice
of
disclosing
overbooking
or
not...
overbooking
or
not
was
outside
the
cab's
definition
of
the
tariff
transportation
service.
they
had
a
regulation
that
specifically
authorized
common
law
actions
in
the
event
that
there
was
nondisclosure
of
overbooking.
so
the
key
thing
is
what's
within
the
scope
of
the
agency's
definition
and
the
statute's
definition
of
the
regulated
service,
and
if
a
claim
involves
the
rates
or
the
services
to
be
provided
in
exchange
for
the
rates,
then
it's
going
to
be
governed
exclusively
by
federal
law
and
federal
standards,
and
state
law
can't
be
applied.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
well,
that's
true,
but
there's
always
going
to
be
questions
of
law
application
in
a
case
like
that.
posner
suggested
he'd
have
to
prove
that
the
ugli
fruit
was
provided
at
a
market
rate.
in
this
case
it's
easy,
because
the
only
relationship
we
had
with
cot
is
that
they
were
our
long
distance
customer.
the
only
thing
we
provided
them
was
regulated
long
distance
service,
and
the
only
thing
they
paid
us
was
the
tariffed
rate,
and
this
is
a
situation
where
the
guarantees
that
they're
seeking,
the
provision
in
billing
guarantees,
weren't
in
the
tariff,
so--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--that
was
our...
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
primary
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
absolutely.
absolutely.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
and
if
this
case--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--well,
in
this
case
there
was
no
occasion
to
ask
for
a
primary
jurisdiction
referral
because
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--your
honor,
if
they
had
brought
this
case
under
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--well,
let
me
answer--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--what
i
was
trying
to
say.
they
brought
this
case
under
the
tariff.
they
didn't
bring
this
case
under
the
tariff.
they
brought
it
under
state
law,
the
state
law
standards.
if
they'd
brought
it
under
the
tariff
we
would
have
sought
summary
judgment
on
the
ground
that
what
we
did
didn't
violate
the
tariff.
if
there'd
been
a
close
question
there,
it
would
have
been
referred
to
the
fcc
under
primary
jurisdiction.
we
raised
a
federal
defense
to
their
state
law
claims
here,
and
it
was
rejected
on
the
ground
that
the
doctrine
only
applies
to
rates,
so
we
didn't...
there
wasn't
any
occasion
for
a
primary
jurisdiction
referral
on
the
validity
of
the
defense
we
asserted.
the...
this
is
a
situation
where
the
court
could
simply
say
the
ninth
circuit
is
wrong,
that
the
doctrine
applies
only
to
rates,
and
send
it
back
to
the
ninth
circuit
to
let
it
review
the
trial
court's
judgment
again.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
it
would
be
an
unlawful
preference
under
the
wabash
rail
and
other
decisions
of
this
court
if
we
had
given
them
a
service
outside
the
scope
of
the
tariff
at
no
extra
charge.
the
only
way
we
could--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--right,
yes.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
and
just...
everyone's
very
interested
in
multilocation
billing.
it's
really
only
the
basis
for
the
decision
that
we
weren't
entitled
to
recover
the
unpaid
charges.
i
don't...
couldn't
possibly
support
the
lost
profits
award.
but
with
respect
to
that,
remember,
this
is
a
service
that
we
designed
for
large
corporate
customers
that
have
locations
in
multiple
cities
any
reseller,
any
customer
is
entitled
to
get
the
service
on
the
same
terms
as
everybody
else.
all
the
terms
of
the
service
reflect
the
needs
of
those
customers.
these
are
customers
that
like
multilocation
billing
because
it
allows
them
to
do
internal...
some
of
them
like
it
because
it
allows
internal
cost
allocations.
if
we
make
mistakes
when
we're
sending
a
bill
to
the
customers
for
whom
it's
designed,
it
doesn't
have
any
big
consequences.
it's
just
an
internal
cost
allocation.
now,
it's
certainly
true...
i
mean,
i
accept
their
claims
that
it
does
have
consequences
for
resellers,
but
their
right
is
to
get
the
service
on...
you
know,
the
service
on
the
terms
set
forth
in
the
tariff,
containing
only
the
service
guarantees
set
forth
in
the
tariff.
this
service
doesn't
have
a
guarantee
they're
going
to
accurately
bill
locations
every
month
because
the
large
customers
didn't...
you
know,
we
didn't
think
they
cared
enough
about
it
to
want
to
pay
extra
for
it.
it's
important
to
these
people.
i
accept
that.
their
way
of
getting
it
under
this
tariff
and
under
the
fcc's
regulations
would
have
been
to
contract
separately
with
us
to
provide
that
billing
service
at
an
extra
market
rate,
and
we
do
that
all
the
time
for
resellers
and
other
customers.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
yes,
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no--
[laughter]
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
a
very--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--it's
a
very...
i
think
it
actually...
it
does
boil
down
to
that.
if
we
were
going
to
guarantee
that
we
were
going
to
accurately
do
that
every
month,
we
would
be
charging
more.
there's
no
such
guarantee
in
our
tariff,
and
we
don't
ever
guarantee...
well,
we
guarantee
some
tariffs
accurate
billing,
but
it's
something
that
people
pay
extra
for.
in
this
service,
the
customers
for
whom
it's
designed
didn't
care
enough
about
this
to
want
to
pay
extra.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
and
it
would
have
been
an
unlawful
rebate--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--if
we'd
given
them
that
unregulated
billing
service--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--for
nothing.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
if
all
they--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--pay
for
is...
if
all
they
pay
us
is
the
tariff
rate--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--all
they're
entitled
to
are
services
that
are
authorized
by
the
tariff,
and
under
the
fcc's
rule
the
particular
kind
of
billing
service
they
want
has
to
be
provided
outside
the
tariff
in
the
deregulated
world.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
i
wouldn't
put
it
quite
that
way.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
the
way
i
would
put
it
is
that
they're
entitled,
in
exchange
for
payment
of
the
tariffed
rate,
to
get
services
that
are
within
the
scope
of
the
tariff.
if
we
give
them
something
extra,
that's
outside
the
scope
of
the
tariff,
whether
it's
a
regulated
something
extra,
or
an
unregulated
something
extra,
that's
a
rebate
and
a
preference.
this
case
is
easy,
because
the
something
extra
is
unregulated
and
can
only
be
provided
in
contracts
and
can't
be
provided
as
part
of
the
tariff
service.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
the--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--the
option
is
regulated,
because
the
option
doesn't
encompass
the
things
that
would
make
it
an
unregulated
service.
unregulated
is
when
we
provide
a...
what's
unregulated
is
if
we
basically
provide
a
service
in
which
we
were
going
to
bill
not
our
customer,
but
the
customers
of
our
customers.
now,
they
say
they're
a
carrier.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no.
for
no
extra
charge,
we
have
told
them
that
we
will
send
bills
to
whatever
locations
that
they
designate
that
will
show
on
the
bill
a
portion
of
the
volume
discount.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
this
is
the
way
in
which
we
bill
our
customer.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
right.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
right.
that's
all
we
can
do
under
the...
the
tariff
governs
the
billing
relationship
between
us
and
our
customers.
if
somebody
wants
a
service
in
which
we're
going
to
help
our
customers
recover
money
for
long
distance
service
from
their
customer--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--what
the
tariff
does
is,
it
prohibits
us
from
providing
the
service
that
they
want.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
no,
your
honor.
we
give
the
customer
a
choice
between
two
ways
of
getting
bills,
neither
of
which
can,
under
the
tariff,
constitute
the
allocation
of
charges.
the
reason
these
services
can
be
lawfully
offered
under
the
tariff
and
the
customers
can
be
lawfully
given
this
option
is
that
the
billing
service
we
offer
doesn't--
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
--if...
they
would
have
to
pay
extra
if
we
guarantee
we
do
it
right,
but
the
other
additional
factor
is,
is
if
we're
assuming
an
obligation
for
billing
their
customers,
which
is
what
they're
claiming,
then
it's
in
the
deregulated
world
that
justice
breyer
referred
to,
and
we
can
only
do
it
by
contract.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
now,
you
know,
people
could
argue
that
the
tariff
should
be
construed
as
requiring
us
to
do
that,
but
basically
the
only
service
guarantees
that
are
enforced
against
us
are
those
that
are
expressed
in
the
tariff.
that
was
what
this
court
held
in
the
kirby
and
the
davis
and
robertson
cases.
mr.
david
w.
carpenter
that's
correct,
your
honor.
