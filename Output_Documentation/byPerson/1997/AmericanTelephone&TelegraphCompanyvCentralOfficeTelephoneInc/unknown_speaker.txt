unknown
speaker
do
we
take
the
case
as
if
there
had
been
no
violation
of
the
federal
statute
201
through
207?
unknown
speaker
are
there
cases
which
tell
us
that
a
state
law,
the
state
law
of
torts,
say,
inform
the
construction
of
reasonableness
under
the
federal
statute?
that
is
to
say,
if
there
were
an
interference
with
an
advantageous
business
relation,
that
this
would
carry
over
to
show
that
this
is
an
unreasonable
implementation
of
the
tariffs
under
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
you're
saying
that
at&t,
then,
is
immune
from
any
sort
of
intentional
interference
with
business
relationship
action
brought
against
it
by
anyone
who
it
had
a
contractual
relationship
with.
that
seems
extreme.
unknown
speaker
i
realize
that,
but
you
would
be
immune
in
many
respects
from
an
ordinary
suit,
say
in
state
court
based
on
state
court
tort
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
was
asking
because
i--
unknown
speaker
--i
have
some
of
the
concerns
indicated
by
the
chief
justice's
question,
whether
or
not
in
interpreting
what
is
reasonable
under
the
federal
statute,
lower
courts
or
the
agency
has
said,
well,
this
is
an
interference
with
an
advantageous
business
relationship
under
state
tort
law,
and
that
informs
our
judgment
as
to
what
is
unreasonable.
unknown
speaker
in
a
federal
court,
or
by
the
fcc?
unknown
speaker
what
if
the...
what
if
at&t
decides
that
central
telephone
is
not
simply
a
customer
but
a
competitor?
unknown
speaker
and
then
decides
simply
to
drive
it
out
of
business?
unknown
speaker
but
it
has
no
state
law--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that
really
is
pushing
one
principle
to
the
very
limit
of
its
logic.
unknown
speaker
i've
read
that,
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
was
the
kind
of
action
that
was
sought
to
be
brought
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--so--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
was
certainly
a
much
less
of
an
expansive
preemption
than
you're
arguing
for
here.
unknown
speaker
you
say
an
intentional
tort
is
preempted.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
it...
can
it
be
brought,
then...
could
the
claims
of
intentional
interference
and
the
claims
of
wilful
breach
have
been
brought
under
the
tariff
as
in
effect
claims
that
the...
that
at&t
had
not
used
what
i
think
the
tariff
called
its
best
efforts
to
provide
the
services
they
had
contracted
for
by
the
time
they
contracted
to
provide
it,
so
that
at
least
with
respect
to
these
two
state
causes
of
action
there
would
have
been
a
federal
remedy?
unknown
speaker
of
the
claims...
i
take
it
you're
conceding
that
they
would
have
stated
claims
under
the
tariff--
unknown
speaker
--if
they
had
been
brought
under
the
tariff.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
is
it
possible
that
you
can
make
a
service
guarantee
that
was
not
covered
by
a
tariff?
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
in
your
briefs
you
describe
network
billing
and
multilocation
billing--
unknown
speaker
--as
not
covered
by
the
tariffs.
unknown
speaker
and
the
tariff
doesn't
require
them
to
select
either
one.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
that
mean
the
tariff
doesn't
require
them
to
select
either
one?
unknown
speaker
what
if
you
made
a
contract
to
give
them
one
option
rather
than
the
other?
would
you
have
to
obey
that
contract?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
my
question.
my
question
is,
you
give
them
a
choice
and
they
say,
we'll
take
network
billing,
and
you
say,
we
will
agree
to
give
it
to
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
we're
not
putting
it...
we're
not
modifying
any
tariff.
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
to
honor
that
contract?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
the
tariff
silently--
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
you
failed
to
use
your
best
efforts
to
provide
that
billing
service
as
you
contracted
to
do,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
tariff,
the
best
effort
provision
of
the
tariff,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that
would
state
a
violation,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
hypothetical
question--
unknown
speaker
--i
take
it
you...
under
justice
stevens'
hypothetical
you
would
have
had
the
option
to
file
that
as
a
tariff,
if
you'd
made
that
arrangement?
unknown
speaker
but
in
the
hypothetical
case--
unknown
speaker
--suppose
that
you
had
agreed
to
provide
the
mol
billing.
would
that
have
been
subject
to
filing
as
a...
could
you
have
filed
that
as
a
tariff
if
you
had
chosen
to
do
so?
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
you
just
say
your
tariff
prevents...
i'm
really
confused
about
your
billing
position,
because
i
thought
you
had
just
said
that
your
tariff
says
you
will
not
allocate.
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--but
yet
you
did
agree...
you
had
a
box
to
check
off,
and
you
agreed
to
provide
this
service
for
which
the
tariff
didn't
provide,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
well,
wasn't...
their
claim
is
that...
oh,
that
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
would
it
have
prevented
you
from
making
a
contract
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
and
would...
and
that
would
have
been
enforceable
in
state
court
or
in
federal
court
on
a
diversity--
unknown
speaker
--but
the
same
doesn't
obtain
for
intentional
interference
with
business
relationships?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
would
slamming
be...
would
an
intentional
interference
with
business
relationships
manifested
by
slamming,
would
that
be
actionable
in
the
state
court?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
why
slamming...
we
don't
have
time
to
go
into
all
the
economics.
i
don't
know
why
slamming
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
that,
just
as
i'm
not
quite
sure
i
understand
nader,
why
overbooking
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
rates
the
carrier--
unknown
speaker
--how
can
you
tell
whether
something
is
being
given
in
exchange
for
the
rates?
i
mean,
even
the
contract
for
ugli
fruit,
you
know,
you
could
get
a
sweetheart
deal
on
ugli
fruit
because
of
the
fact
that
you're
paying
more
for
the
rates.
it's
very
hard
to
know
what's...
you
know,
what
is
getting
the
benefit
of
the
rates
and
what
isn't.
unknown
speaker
so
if
you
did
this
for
them,
the
only
reason
you
would
have
done
it
was
because
of
the
rates
that
you
got.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
was
a
whole
doctrine
of
law
designed
to
answer
that
question,
which
i
didn't
see
here.
i
mean,
if
in
fact
you
have
a
generalized
statutory
framework
like
tort
law
or
something,
and
congress
may
have
created
an
exception
for
certain
activities
that
fall
within
the
jurisdiction
of
an
agency,
and
you
have
a
tariff
that
may
or
may
not
cover
those
activities,
and
the
court
is
uncertain
about
the
extent
to
which
this
particular
kind
of
activity
does
or
does
not
fall
within
the
tariff,
or
fall
within
the
statutorily
implied
exemption,
i
thought
there
was
a
doctrine
of
law
designed
to
cover
that.
unknown
speaker
yes,
exactly.
unknown
speaker
primary
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
but
nobody
asked
for
primary...
i
mean,
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
about
that?
unknown
speaker
because
it's
obvious
that
it's
within
the
statutory
exemption,
implied.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
mean
to
cut
you
off.
you
were
just
giving
an
answer.
say
what
you
said.
say
what
you--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
before
you
leave
the
billing
aspect
of
this
claim,
maybe
you
can
clarify
my
confusion.
as
i
understand
that
claim,
it
is
that
you
billed
the
customers
directly,
as
was
requested,
the
multilocation,
but
you
gave
the
customers
the
full
discount,
which
meant
that
the
resellers
lost
the
only
thing
that
they
were
in
the
business
for,
that
is--
unknown
speaker
--and
you
then
said
here
that
you
could
have
an
agreement
outside
the
tariff
with
regard
to
the
billing
options,
so
if
you
can
have
an
agreement
outside
the
tariff
for
the
billing
options,
then
why
wouldn't
the
breach
of
that
agreement
be
a
proper
lawsuit
for
state
court?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
you
say
you
could
do
it
outside--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
has
to
be
for
an
extra
charge.
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
mr.
carpenter,
i
lost
part
of
your
explanation.
you
said
that
the
choice
between
network
billing
and
multilocation
billing
was
available
to
them
at
no
extra
charge,
as
i
under--
unknown
speaker
--so
why
should
they
have
to
pay
extra
for
it
to
have
a
binding
agreement
to
take
one
rather
than
the
other.
they
only
have
to
pay
extra
to
get
it
done
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
tendentious
way
to
put
it,
but--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
it...
this...
i
thought
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong,
because
i
think
it's
important...
is
that
there
are
certain
services
that
at&t
in
our
odd,
sort
of
half-slave,
half-free
world
that
we
have
at
the
moment,
provides
on
the
free
side
and
the
fcc
has
a
tariff,
or
has
a
rule,
rather,
that
says
certain
kinds
of
areas
don't
fall
within
the
tariffs.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
because
of
that
rule,
not
because
of
any
fairness
or
anything
else
in
the
situation,
it's
because
of
that
rule
that
you
operate
now
in
the
nonregulated
world,
and
once
you're
in
the
nonregulated
world,
of
course,
contract
law,
tort
law
and
every
other
law
governs.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
why,
not
because
of
the
fairness
of
the
situation
or
anything
else,
that
had
they
paid
for
it
they
would
have
taken
themselves
within
the
scope
of
that
rule--
unknown
speaker
--and
thereby
removed
themselves
from
the
tariff-regulated
world.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
in
the
regulated
world.
unknown
speaker
if...
as
long...
if
they
don't
pay
for
it,
they're
in
the
regulated
world
defined
by
the
fcc
tariff...
the
fcc
rule.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
the
reason
you
said
what
you
just
said...
i
want
you...
i
want
to
be
sure
i'm
thinking
about
this
right...
is
because
when
they
don't
pay
for
it
under
a
particular
fcc
interpretation
of
a
statute
or
something,
they
fall
within
the
regulated
world.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
you
put
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the
option
regulated
or
unregulated?
unknown
speaker
when
you
give
them
an
option,
is
that
regulated
or
un--
unknown
speaker
--but
as
i
understand
it,
you've
told
them
that
for
no
extra
charge
you
will
do
that.
unknown
speaker
bills
to
them,
as
distinct
from
bills
to
their
customer?
who
are
you
billing
when
you--
unknown
speaker
--right,
so
the
bill
is
going
to
read,
you,
customer,
pay
so
much
for
service
at
this
location,
as
opposed
to
your...
you,
customer's
customer,
pay
this?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
as
i
understand
it,
the
tariff
doesn't
require
you
to
do
either
of
those
options.
unknown
speaker
it
prohibits
you
from
giving
that
option
to
the
customer,
because
i
thought
you
did
give
that
option
to
the
customer.
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying,
as
i
understand
it,
is
you
can
give
the
option
pursuant
to
the
tariff,
but
if
you
guarantee
the
option,
they
have
to
pay
extra.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
the
part
that
i
don't
understand
is...
i
understand
your
last
statement
that
if
you're
going
to
bill
the
customer's
customer,
that's
in
the
deregulated
world.
you
can
only
do
it
by
separate
contract,
separate
consideration.
what
about
the
situation
in
which
you
bill
your
customer?
i
thought
you
could
not
make
a
separate
contract
to
bill
your
customer
accurately
for
separate
consideration
because
that
would
be
at
variance
with
the
tariff.
unknown
speaker
that
is
correct,
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
in...
perhaps
in
kidding
around
with
one
of
the
questions
earlier
you
may
have
conceded
too
much,
because
i
thought
you
were
conceding
that
if
the
customer
wanted
the
tariff
service
of
multilocation
billing
done
accurately,
and
wanted
to
be
able
to
enforce
it
as
an
obligation
to
do
it
accurately,
the
customer
would
have
to
pay
extra
for
it,
separate
consideration,
and
i
think
your
answer
is
no,
the
customer...
we
simply
cannot
do
that
and
the
customer
cannot
do
it.
the
only
thing
we
can
do
which
adds
or
is
different
from
what
is
in
the
tariff
is
to
provide
the
entirely
separate
service
of
billing
the
customer's
customer.
that's
unregulated.
that,
we
can
do
it,
that
they
can
enforce
by
contract.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
carpenter.
mr.
hall,
we'll
hear
from
you.
would
you
tell
us
what
was
the
basis
for
federal
jurisdiction
in
the
district
court
here,
mr.
hall?
unknown
speaker
just
on
the
last
point,
because
i
think
it
follows
from
what
we've
just
been
discussing
with
petitioner's
counsel,
if
the
service
is
provided
by
the
tariff
then
you
should
have
sued
under
the
federal
law
sections
201
through
207
for
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
tariff,
or
unreasonable
provision
of
services
in
violation
of
the
tariff,
and
you
didn't
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
important
because
we're
trying
to
ask
if
there
is
a
cause
of
action
and,
if
so,
what
it
is.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're
right--
--but
your
case
is...
it
seems
to
me
it's
very
important
for
us
to
understand
whether
or
not
you
would
have
had
a
cause
of
action
under
this
third
argument
that
you
mentioned
that
the
tariffs
did,
in
fact,
provide
this
and
it
wasn't
being
given.
it
seems
to
me
the
answer
to
that
is
to
sue
under
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
but
surely
a
person
cannot,
by
tariff,
change
the
meaning
of
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
so
your
argument
is
that...
in
fact,
your
claim...
your
claim,
this
kind
of
a
claim,
when
we
read
the
communications
statute,
the
communications
statute
does
not
mean
to
preempt
this
kind
of
claim.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
fine.
either
your
argument
arises
under
the
tariff,
or
it
doesn't.
unknown
speaker
if
it
does,
justice
kennedy
says
go
to
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
if
it
doesn't,
i
say
don't
the
courts
continuously...
hasn't
this
court
continuously,
where
it's
a
close
question,
in
the
antitrust
area,
for
example,
said
where
the
claim
is,
judge,
the
communications
statute,
the
regulatory
statute
isn't
meant
to
preempt
this
kind
of
claim.
where
that's
a
close
question,
hasn't
this
court
always
said
go
first
to
the
commission
and
see
what
they
think?
go
first,
get
the
interpretation
of
the
tariff,
get
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
get
their
views
on
whether
that's
so
or
not,
and
then
come
to
court.
unknown
speaker
maybe
they
didn't,
but
what's
the
judge
supposed
to
do
if
he
wants
to
follow
the
law?
unknown
speaker
now,
wait,
do
you
read
that
as
saying
any
state
cause
of
action
for
wilful
misconduct
will
lie?
i
read
it
as
saying
that
the
limitations
which
the
tariff
has
on
liability,
those
limitations
contained
in
the
tariff
do
not
apply
in
the
case
of
wilful
misconduct.
for
example,
(b)
says...
all
of
this
is
on
page
10a
of
your
brief,
the
blue
brief.
i'm
sorry,
the
petitioner's
brief.
(b)
says
the
company
is
not
liable
for
damages
associated
with
service
channels
or
equipment
which
it
does
not
furnish.
well,
i
suppose
that
if
they
intentionally
somehow
got
you
assigned
somebody
else's
equipment
that
was
inferior,
this
wilful
misconduct
provision
would
eliminate
that,
that
exemption.
unknown
speaker
but
i
don't
read
it
as
saying
that
so
long
as
it's
wilful
you
can
bring
suit
for
over...
i
mean,
for
charging
you
too
much.
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
you
ultimately
have
to
get
down
to
that
argument.
wilful
doesn't
take
you
out
of
the
box
if
you
have
to
prove--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
have
the
obligation
to
ask
them?
that
is,
why
isn't
our
problem,
or
is
it...
we
say,
of
course,
if
it's
a
tariff
violation
or
the
tariff
was
unreasonable
under
the
statute,
which
you
could
also
argue,
you
should
have
gone
to
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
now,
on
your
argument,
which
is,
all
that's
irrelevant
because
the
statute
doesn't
mean
to
preempt
state
unfair
competition
law,
you
still
should
have
gone
to
the
commission
to
get
some
determination
about
that.
now,
if
you
ran
into
a
statute
of
limitations
problem,
maybe
you
file
your
case
in
the
court
and
then
ask
them
under
primary
jurisdiction
to
hold
it
while
you
go
to
the
commission,
but
that
would
be
your
responsibility.
so
why
don't
we
end
up
saying,
at
least
it's
a
close
question,
therefore
you
didn't
go
to
the
right
place?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
a
classic
case,
isn't
it,
if
you're
saying
this
is
all
too
complicated,
it's
absurd
to
think
that
people
have
to
read
all
this,
where
you
would
go
to
the
commission
and
say,
commission,
the
statute
requires
reasonable
rate
services.
their
rate
and
services
under
a
thing
like
that,
nobody
can
understand
that,
and
therefore
it's
totally
unreasonable,
and
therefore
it's
outside
the
statute,
and
moreover,
we
get
reparations.
reparations,
i
take
it,
is
something
the
fcc
can
award,
or
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
complaint,
mr.
hall,
was
not
of
a
violation
of
any
provisions
of
the
act,
was
it,
or
was
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
it
seems
to
me
your
response
to
justice
breyer's
question
is
not
adequate,
because
section
208
seems
to
say
that
if
you're
complaining
about
a
carrier's
violation
of
the
act
you
can
file
a
complaint
with
the
commission
and
the
commission
will
adjudicate
it.
unknown
speaker
what
is...
is
that
a
regulation?
unknown
speaker
but
how
could
a
tariff
repeal
a
part
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
but
why
couldn't
he...
why
shouldn't
he,
why
mustn't
he
do
it
under
the
federal
statute?
unknown
speaker
it
says
the
company's
liability
is
not
limited
by
the
tariff,
as
i
assume
the
company
has
to
pay
an
amount
that's
not
set
forth
in
the
tariff
in
the
event
of
wilful
misconduct,
but
that
is
far
different
from
saying
that
it
must
look
to
state
law
and
that
the
customer
can
go
to
state
law.
your
intentional
tort,
misconduct,
interference,
now
is
that
brought
under
the...
is
that
a
violation
of
the
act,
or
is
that
a
state
law
claim?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
then
that
you
wouldn't...
even
if
we
assume
that
you
would
have
to
go
to
the
commission
to
get
adjudicated
a
claim
that
what
at&t
did
was
in
violation
of
the
act,
if
you're
not
claiming
a
violation
of
the
act,
then
presumably
that
would
not
apply
and
you
wouldn't
have
to
go
the
commission.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
try
to
put
you
out
of
business
by
charging
too
much,
charging
more
than
their
filed
tariff
allows
for
this
service.
unknown
speaker
would
you
have
a
separate
state
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
the
prices
charged
were
the
tariff
prices.
they
were
complaining
that
the
tariff
prices
were
set
at
such
a
level
that
there
was
a
squeeze
between
what
it
cost
them
to
provide
the
service
and
what
they
had
to
pay
to
the
carrier.
unknown
speaker
just
answer
my
question.
suppose
you
claimed
that
the
way
they
were
trying
to
harm
you
as
a
competitor
was
by
charging
you
more
than
the
tariff
allowed,
would
you
have
a
private
cause
of
action
for
that
either
under
2.3.1
or
anywhere
else?
unknown
speaker
you
see,
i
thought
you
had
conceded
that
point.
in
answer
to
my
question
earlier,
when
we
were
talking
about
wilful
misconduct,
i
thought
the
position
you
took
was
that
all
that
wilful
misconduct
applies
to
is
wilful
misconduct
with
regard
to
matters
other
than
the
tariffed
items,
but
you're
now
saying
that
it
includes
wilful
misconduct
even
regarding
the
matters
covered
in
the
tariff.
unknown
speaker
okay.
they
can
i...
i'm
trying
to
be
helpful
to
you
on
this
first
part
of
the
question.
i'm
going
back
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
which
was
the
question
of
let's
focus,
forgetting
all
the
tariff
stuff,
forgetting
everything
but
your
state
claim,
which
you
say
was
saved
from
the
statute
by
the
savings
clause.
unknown
speaker
that's,
i
take
it,
another
way
of
saying
that
this
statute,
the
communications
act,
does
not
mean
to
displace
state
law
here.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
the
case
that's
most
in
your
favor
i
think
is
nader,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
if
i
think
of
nader,
i
think
of
a
case
where
this
court
thought
that
the
law,
the
state
law
was
clear
enough,
given
a
decision
by
the
agency
that
we
want
nothing
to
do
with
overbooking.
that's
a
matter
of
state
tort
law.
in
light
of
that,
it's
clear
enough
that
you
can
proceed
in
court
without
ever
going
to
the
fcc
or
the
agency.
unknown
speaker
all
the
antitrust
cases
say,
it's
not
at
all
clear.
we
don't
know
what
this
means,
or
whether
congress
did
or
did
not
want
to
displace
the
federal
system
of
antitrust
law,
so
go
to
the
agency
first.
we
want
their
advice.
now,
why
does
your
case
fall
within
the
first
and
not
the
second?
unknown
speaker
why...
in
other
words,
my
first
take
on
it
would
be,
of
course
congress
wanted
to
displace
state
unfair
competition
law.
at
least
it's
unclear.
now,
why
is
my
initial
take
on
that
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
response
that
at&t
makes
to
that,
of
course,
is
that
how...
you
can't
possibly
interpret
a
savings
clause,
unless
you're
going
to
gut
the
federal
legislation,
to
save
state
law
that
positively
contradicts
the
federal
law.
i
mean,
that's
interpreting
it
so
much
so
that
there's
nothing
left
of
the
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
it
depends.
if
you
try
to...
if
your
claim
is
that
they
tried
to
put
you
out
of
business
by
committing
a
violation
of
the
federal
communications
act,
then
you're
simply
contradicting
the
communications
act
if
you're
asserting
that
they
should
have
provided
you
off-tariff
services
which
the
tariff...
which
the
act
does
not
permit
them
to
provide.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
your
business
claim
you're
contradicting
the
act.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
want
to...
i
thought
you'd
finished
your
answer.
unknown
speaker
i
just
want
to
get
two
things
straight
on
the
record
for
my
own
information.
until
justice
breyer
raised
this
question
about
primary
jurisdiction,
had
the
at&t
ever,
or
the
district
court
or
anybody
else
suggested
that
there
was
a
primary
jurisdiction
issue
in
the
case?
unknown
speaker
and
the
second
question
i
have
is,
has
the
fcc...
have
they
filed
an
amicus
brief
at
any
stage
of
these
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
unusual.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
and
the
third...
i
guess
my
third
question
is,
is
it
your
claim
that
the
matters
of
which
you
complain
are
outside
the
tariff
or
within
the
tariff?
unknown
speaker
what's
wilful--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
the
difference
between...
let's
imagine
in
maislin
we
have
a
trucking
firm,
and
the
trucking
firm
charges
lower
than
tariff
rates
to
a
whole
lot
of
shippers,
a
lot
of
them,
and
then
later
on
they
all
go
out
of
business
when
the
trucking
firm
comes
along
and
has
to
raise
the
rates.
well,
i
mean,
is
that
a
matter
not
for
the
icc?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
matter...
i
mean,
what's
the...
there's
a
filed
rate.
the
filed
rate
says
you
have
to
charge
$1.
they
charge
50
cents.
it
was
all
in
very
good
faith
and
so
forth,
and
nonetheless
the
tariff
said
$1,
so
lo
and
behold
they
had
to
pay
$1.
they
all
went
out
of
business.
i
mean,
who
knows
what
happened
to
them.
unknown
speaker
how
does
your
case
differ
from
that,
because
what
they're
saying
as
well,
at
worst,
you
know...
at
worst,
accepting
everything
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--this
is
an
instance
where
they
filed
tariffs
as
to
services.
they
say
what
it
is.
perhaps
wrongly,
at&t
goes
and
gives
some
different
services,
or
it
doesn't
do
what
it
said
in
the
tariff,
or
whatever,
just
like
those
trucks
in
maislin,
and
now
you're
hurt,
but
we
said
in
maislin,
follow
the
rate--
unknown
speaker
--follow
the
tariff.
follow
the
file.
what's
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
the
rates
and
services
are
treated
alike,
aren't
they?
it's
rates,
service--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i...
you
know,
i
think
it's
easy
to
say
that
selecting
between,
what
is
it,
multiple
location
billing
and
the
other
billing,
selecting
between
one
or
the
other
doesn't
affect
rates.
they're
willing
to
give
you
the
option.
it
apparently
cost
them
no
more
to
do
the
one
than
the
other.
but
selecting
between
multiple
location
billing
in
which
they
make
sure
that
what's
billed
to
that
location
is
only
the
stuff
that's
been
charged
to
it,
and
whatever
else,
that
is
something
that
affects
rates,
because
the
tariff
says
you're
not
going
to
get
that,
and
because
it
does
take
a
lot
more
expenditure
on
their
part
and
they're
not
willing
to
provide
it
without
more
money.
how
can
you
say
that
that
doesn't
affect
rates?
unknown
speaker
now,
that
was
a
violation
of
the
tariff,
you
say,
because--
unknown
speaker
--and
you'd
have
a
remedy
for
that
at
the
communications
commission,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
any
intentional
violation
of
a
tariff
you
can
go
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
do
i
have
to
agree
with
you
on
that
in
order
for
you
to
win
the
case,
because
i
find
that
an
extraordinary
proposition,
that
even
for
the
most
clear
tariff
violations
you
can
sue
under
state
law,
so
long
as
they
have
been
wilful.
it
just--
unknown
speaker
--ah.
ah.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
unknown
speaker
and
so
long
as
they
are
not
rate-affecting.
unknown
speaker
well,
is
there
anything
in
the
tariff
that
is
not
rate-affecting?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
i
see,
and
what...
okay.
but
that...
doesn't
that
get
you
right
back
into
the
preference
that
was
the
whole
purpose
of
the
filed
rate
doctrine?
i
thought
the
filed
rate
doctrine
said
you
put
everything
in
your
tariff
and
these
are
the
terms.
all
takers
get
the
same
thing.
but
if
you
then
say
there
are
some
things
that
are
not
rate-affecting,
that
you
put
those
outside
the
tariff,
it
seems
to
defeat
the
whole
purpose
of
what
the
filed
rate
doctrine...
which
may
be
passe,
but
that's
another
matter.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
justice
ginsburg
was
talking
about
matters
set
forth
in
the
tariff,
not
these
side
agreements.
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
even
some
things
set
forth
in
the
tariff
don't
affect
the
rates,
and
you
can
sue
for
failure
to
provide
those
provisions
under
state
law
so
long
as
they're
not
rate-affecting,
and
i
just
find
that
a
difficult
problem.
unknown
speaker
but
the
ninth
circuit
passed
on
that
question.
unknown
speaker
your
view
is
they
waived
it,
is
that
right?
you're
saying
they
waived
it,
that
they...
they
came
in
and
brought
an
ordinary
state
law
tort
suit.
you
won,
they
lost.
nobody
says
a
word
about
tariffs
to
the
fcc,
and
now
you're
saying
nobody
raised
this
till
appeal,
so
it's
waived.
is
that
the
point?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hall,
at
page
51
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
pretrial
order,
(g),
first
affirmative
defense,
filed
tariff
doctrine.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
their
first
affirmative
defense.
i
don't
know
if...
so
they
at
least
have
talked
about--
--all
right,
so--
unknown
speaker
i
take
it
the
argument
of
at&t
is
that
if
you
had
been
simply
a
competitor
and
not
a
customer,
there
might
have
been
a
cause
of
action
here,
but
the
customer
relation
trumps
your
standing
as
a
competitor.
is
that
their
argument?
unknown
speaker
do
you
have
some
cases
that
refute
that?
