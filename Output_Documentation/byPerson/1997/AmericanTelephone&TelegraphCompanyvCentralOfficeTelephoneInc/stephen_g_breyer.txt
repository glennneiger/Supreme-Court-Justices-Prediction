justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
we're
speaking
practically,
is
there
anything
impractical
about
the
following:
you
file
your
complaint
in
court
to
protect
against
the
statute
of
limitations.
you
then
go
to
the
commission
and
raise
all
your
claims
having
to
do
with
the
tariff.
you
might
win.
if
you
lose,
at
least
there's
a
good
chance
there'll
be
something
that
comes
out
of
the
commission
that
clarifies
the
remaining
question,
namely
the
question
of
whether,
if
you
lose
everything
within
the
tariffs,
nonetheless,
nothing
preempts
the
operation
of
state
law
in
this
area.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
is
there
anything
wrong
with
that,
which
is
what
i
thought
that...
you
know,
there
are
quite
a
few
cases
that
suggest
that's
the
right
route.
