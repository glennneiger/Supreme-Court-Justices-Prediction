justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
president
could
change
that,
the
scope
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
those...
those
other
uses
you're
referring
to,
i
mean
they
are
very
common.
it
seems
to
me
are
quite
different.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
use
for
the
purpose
of
deciding
whether
you're
going
to
send
somebody
to
jail.
justice
antonin
scalia
or
for
whether
you're
going
to
let
a
murderer
back...
back
out
on
the
streets.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but,
you
know,
i
mean,
i...
i
might
exclude
somebody
from
the
sensitive
secrets
of
his...
of
the
nation
if
his...
you
know,
if
his...
if
his
uncle
is
a...
a
chinese
communist.
could
i
use
that
in
a
criminal
trial?
i
mean,
what...
you
know,
what
the
government
thinks
creates
enough
of
a
doubt
to
exclude
somebody
from
sensitive
in...
information
bears
no
relationship
to
what
creates
enough
of
a
doubt
to
be
admissible
in
a
criminal
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
then,
all
of
these
uses
are
really...
don't...
don't
establish
your
point
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
they
deny
that
it
might
have
a
certain
level
of
reliability
and...
and,
just
in
case
it
does,
they...
they
use
it.
and
however
doubtful
it
may
be,
they...
they...
they
choose
to
exclude
people
from
national
security
information
on
that
basis.
but
that...
that...
that's
a
world
apart
from
saying
it's
reliable
enough
to
make
the
decision
whether
you're
going
to
send
somebody
to
jail
or
not
send
somebody
to
jail
who
belongs
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
you
mean.
what
do
you
mean,
he
would
sort
it
out?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
issue
for
the
jury,
it
seems
to
me,
is
whether
this
person
who
administered
the
polygraph
test
is
any
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
the
judge
decide
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
once
it
goes
to
the
jury,
the
ju...
the
jury
is
certainly
entitled
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
this
person
who
administered
the
polygraph
test
is
a
hack.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
comes
to
the
wrong
conclusion
most
of
the...
isn't
the
jury
entitled
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
aren't
you
entitled
to
put
in
evidence
to
show
that
this
person
is
a
hack?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
this
constitutional
rule
you're
asserting.
you're
asserting
that
if
the
evidence
exists
out
there
already,
because
the
government
has
given
a
test,
he
has
a
constitutional
right
to
have
it
admitted.
but
he
does
not
have
a
constitutional
right
to
develop
a
test
on
his
own,
to
hire
his
own...
his
own
polygraph
administrator
and
have
that
put
before
the
jury?
justice
antonin
scalia
no;
i
understand.
but...
but
isn't
it...
isn't
it
the
logic
of
your
position
not
only
that
what
polygraph
tests
are
extant,
having
been
given
by
the
government,
must
be
admitted,
but
also
that
you
must
allow
a
defendant
to
hire
a...
a...
and
administer
a
polygraph
test,
and...
and
get
that
admitted,
if
it's...
if
it's
a
reliable--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
think
so.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
your
argument,
every
rule
has
to
have
an
exception?
this...
this...
this
is...
this
is
the
principle
you're
urging
upon
us?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
really,
the...
the...
the
key
difference
between...
between
all
of
these...
all
of
these
other
rules
of
admissibility
and...
is
what
justice
souter
was
inquiring
into.
and
that
is,
leaping
over,
into...
into
this
new
field
of...
of
accepting
evidence
on
whether...
whether
the
defendant
is
lying
here,
today,
in
this
trial,
on
this
fact.
and
that's...
that's...
if...
if
polygraphs
are
really
that
good,
you
know,
90
percent
accurate,
what
do
you
think
the
accuracy
of
juries
is?
you
think
it's
90
percent?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
it's
lower
than
90
percent,
maybe
we
should
just
dispense
with
juries
and
have
polygraphs.
you
wouldn't
need
juries.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
sheffield,
if...
if
we
agree
that
polygraphs
have
to
be
used
in
the...
as...
that
the
constitution
requires
polygraphs
to
be
used
in
military
trials,
i
suppose
it
would
follow
that...
that
they
have
to
be
used
in
civilian
criminal
trials.
i
mean,
we...
we
couldn't
have
one
rule
for
the
milit...
one
constitutional
rule
for
the
military
and...
right?
i
mean,
a
fortiori--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in...
in
federal
district
courts,
we
have...
what
about
civil
cases,
is
there
any
reason
why
the
constitutional
requirements
wouldn't
apply
to
civil
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right,
there...
there
are
no...
there...
there
are
no
restrictions
on
the
processes
that...
that
can
be
used
in...
in
civil
trials--
justice
antonin
scalia
--especially
in
those
civil
trials
in
federal
courts,
where
a
jury
is
required?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i...
i
would
expect
the
same
argument
to
be
made.
look,
i'm...
i'm
trying
to
prove
my
case,
defend
my
property,
my
livelihood.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you're
excluding
perfectly
relevant
evidence
that...
that
the
constitution
requires
to
be
allowed
in
criminal
trials.
as
a
matter
of
due
process,
i
don't
know
how
you
could
exclude
it
from
a
civil
trial.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it...
it
has
to
be
admitted
if
the
judge
finds...
finds
that
this
is
a
good...
a
good
enough
expert.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
those
safeguards
were...
were
eliminated,
the
army
could...
could
then
no
longer
admit
polygraph
evidence?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if...
if
we
rule
that
it
must
be
admitted
only
because
there
are
all
of
these
safeguards,
the
military
could
get
them
unadmitted
again
by
simply
eliminating
all
the
safeguards.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah.
i
mean,
go...
go
under
the
colander,
the
colander
theory
instead,
just--
[laughter]
right.
