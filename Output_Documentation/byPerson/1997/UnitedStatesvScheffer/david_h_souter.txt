mr.--
justice
david
h.
souter
--mr.
dreeben,
could
you
go
back
to
your
use
of
the
polygraph
itself?
what
decisions
does
the
government
make
itself
on
the
basis
of
polygraph
evidence?
i
mean,
one
of
the...
excuse
me.
i'm
just
adverting
to
the
issue
of
arbitrariness
in
saying
it
can't
come
in
but
we
use
it
for
other
purposes.
what
decisions
does
the
government
make
in
reliance
on
polygraph
evidence?
justice
david
h.
souter
not
even
to
hire
or
not
hire
someone?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
basically
you
use
it
as
a
kind
of
a
tip-off
of
something,
as
a
means
of
putting
somebody
on
the
spot,
legitimately,
but
that's
as
far
as
the
government
goes?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i
realize
there
may
be
exceptions,
but
in
sub...
substantially,
that
is
the
only
kind
of
use
that's
made.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
criminal
investigation
likewise,
i
assume?
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
the
tainted
morsel
of
the
20th
century.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--isn't
it
also
the
logic
of
your
position
that
if
we
agree
with
you
to
exactly
that
extent,
we
would
also
have
to
strike
down
a
rule,
a
per
se
rule,
that
excluded
the
opinions
of
psychiatrists
or
psychologists
on
the
specific
truth
telling
of
a
witness?
justice
david
h.
souter
we
would...
we
would...
we
would
have
to
say,
well,
the
door
is
not
entirely
shut
to
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
what's
the
answer?
justice
david
h.
souter
we'd...
we'd
have
to...
we'd
have
to--
[laughter]
--we'd
have
to
open
the
door.
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
you
can
make
the
same
argument,
absent
the...
the...
the
mechanics
on...
on
the
part
of
the
psychiatrist,
a
psy...
or
a
psychologist,
with...
with
long
clinical
experience,
and
the
opportunity
to
verify
the
stories
of
the...
of
the
people
interviewed,
with...
with
independently
verified
facts.
and
it
seems
to
me
that,
on
your
logic,
that
kind
of
specific
credibility
testimony
would
at
least
have
to
be
ad...
admissible
potentially.
wouldn't...
wouldn't
you
agree?
justice
david
h.
souter
but--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but...
but
you
really...
therefore,
if
we
accept
your
position,
we're...
we're
going
to
make
a
determination
not
only
about
polygraphs,
but
i
suppose
we
would
be
making
a...
a
kind
of
sea
change
in...
in...
in
a...
in
a
constitutional
evidence
rule.
because
we
would
be,
in
effect,
forcing
the
courts
into
a...
a
realm
of
evidence
which,
as
a...
as
a
general
rule,
an
almost
universally
general
rule,
is
inadmissible.
and
that
is,
evidence
about
the
specific
truth
telling
in
a
given
instance.
so
we
would...
we
would
really
be
entering
a...
a
new
evidentiary
realm
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
sheffield,
what
do
you
make
of
the...
the...
of
the
information
provided
in
one
of
the
government
briefs...
i
forget
which...
to
the
effect
that
less
than
one-third
of
the
members
of
the
two
major
polygraph
examiners'
organizations
are
of
the
opinion
that
their...
that
their...
that
their
opinions
should
be
admissible
in
evidence?
