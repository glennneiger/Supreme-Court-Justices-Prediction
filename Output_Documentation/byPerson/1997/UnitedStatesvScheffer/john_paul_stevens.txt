paul

mr.
dreeben,
can
i
ask
you
this.
there's
a
brief
filed
by
an
amicus,
a
group
of
social
scientists
who
say
that,
if
properly
conducted,
these
tests
are
accurate
about
90
percent
of
the
time.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
you
would
accept
that,
or
you
would
say
that's
probably
wrong,
but
assume
that's
correct,
and
if
there
are
proper
safeguards
given
and
all
the
rest,
what
would
your
position
be?
even
if
it
was
100
percent
accurate,
would
you
still
say,
along
the
argument
you're
making
to
justice
ginsburg,
this
still
should
be
excluded?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
if
completely
reliable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
as
reliable
as
fingerprints
or
dna
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
doesn't--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why
doesn't
fingerprint
do
the...
evidence
do
the
same
thing
if
the
witness
says...
gets
on
the
stand
and
says,
i
was
never
in
the
place
where
the
crime
took
place,
and
somebody
says,
well,
your
fingerprints
were
there.
doesn't
that
do
the
same
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it's
reputation
as
to
credibility
that
the
character
witness
testifies
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
as
to
credibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
it's
precisely
the
same
issue
that
the
polygraph
evidence
is
directed
to,
credibility.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
there's
a
difference
as
to
the
degree
of
reliability
between
the
two,
obviously,
and...
but
your
position
as
i
understand
it
is,
even
if
it
were
totally
reliable,
you
would
still
take
the
same
position
it's
inadmissible.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
how
do
you...
but
then
are
you
saying
that
the
scientists
who
filed
a
brief
saying
it's
90-percent
accurate
if
conducted
properly,
that
we
should
disbelieve
the
substance
of
that
brief?
that's
basically
what
you're
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
is
true,
is
it
not,
that
we
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
practice
of
the
government
itself
in
routinely
using
its
experts
for
this
very
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know
how
you
avoid
that.
may
i
ask,
along
that
line,
you're
objecting
to
a
per
se
rule.
supposing
they
change
the
per
se
rule
and
said,
no
polygraph
evidence
shall
be
admitted
unless
the
examiner
met
the
following
qualifications:
5
years
training,
a
degree
from
such
and
such
a
school,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
would
you
challenge
that
kind
of
per
se
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
but
i'm...
i'm
asking
about
a...
a
proposed
hypothetical
per
se
rule
that
defined
minimum
qualifications
for
the
examinations,
and
just
categorically
said,
all
those
that
don't
meet
this
standard
are,
per
se,
inadmissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
what
the
rule
is
in
the
military,
if
there
is
one,
in
cases
involving
very
young
children
who
might
have
been
cla...
claim
to
have
been
sexually
abused
or
something
of
that
kind,
who
recount
the
instance
to
a...
a
caretaker
soon
after
the
incident
occurred.
is
the
caretaker
allowed
to
testify
as
to
his
or
her
opinion
as
to
the
truthfulness
of
what
the
child
was
describing?
