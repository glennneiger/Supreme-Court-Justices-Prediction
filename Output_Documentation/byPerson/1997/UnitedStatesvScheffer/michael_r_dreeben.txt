mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
polygraph
evidence
is
opinion
evidence
about
credibility.
based
on
inherent
doubts
about
the
reliability
of
polygraph
evidence
and
the
burdens
of
litigating
about
polygraph
results,
it
has
long
been
banned
from
courtrooms
in
a
majority
of
the
states.
in
1991,
the
president
adopted
the
same
rule
for
military
courts
martial.
exercising
delegated
authority
from
congress,
the
president
promulgated
rule
707,
which
makes
polygraph
evidence
per
se
inadmissible
in
military
courts
martials.
that
determination
is
constitutionally
valid
for
three
main
reasons.
first,
the
reliability
of
the
polygraph
remains
unproven.
second,
polygraph
evidence
is
not
necessary
to
help
the
trier
of
fact
perform
its
core
function
of
determining
credibility
of
witnesses,
and
third,
the
costs
of
litigating
about
the
reliability
of
polygraph
evidence
on
a
case-by-case
basis
outweigh
any
limited
probative
value
that
the
polygraph
may
have.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
in
1987,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
then
the
court
of
appeal...
military
appeals,
determined
that
the
per
se
rule
against
polygraph
evidence
which
had
prevailed
in
the
military
should
be
dropped,
and
that
individual
defendants
should
have
the
opportunity
to
litigate
about
it
in
each
case,
and
in
1991
the
evident
response
to
that
was
to
reinstate
the
per
se
rule
that
had
been
prevalent
in
courts
across
the
country
as
well
as
the
military
courts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
it
is
not,
justice
o'connor.
in
the
states,
27
states
have
per
se
rules;
22
states
allow
polygraph
evidence
into...
to
be
admitted
only
if
there
is
a
stipulation
between
the
parties
so
that
the
parties
have
agreed
to
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
one
state
is.
the
state
of
new
mexico
is
allowing
polygraph
evidence
in
on
a
routine
basis,
provided
that
a
very
strict
list
of
procedural
requirements
are
satisfied,
but--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
that
that's
fair.
the
requirements
are
spelled
out
in
the
statute
with
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--far
greater
degree
of
specificity
than
for
other
expert
testimony.
now,
in
the
federal
system--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
the
respondent's
position
here
is...
goes
quite
a
bit
further
than
daubert.
daubert,
of
course,
is
simply
an
interpretation
of
federal
rule
of
evidence
702.
the
respondent's
position
here
is
that
the
constitution
prohibits
any
promulgator
of
a
system
of
evidentiary
rules
from
establishing
a
per
se
rule.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
there
is
any
inconsistency.
the
point
of
daubert
was
to
drop
the
strict
rule
of
general
acceptance
in
the
scientific
community
as
a
prerequisite
for
scientific
evidence
to
be
admitted.
daubert
did
not
do
away
with
the
rest
of
the
evidentiary
considerations
that
may
bear
on
whether
particular
evidence
may
be
admitted.
prominent
among
those
are
the
requirement
in
rule
702
itself
that
evidence
in
the
form
of
expert
testimony
must
assist
the
trier
of
fact,
and
furthermore
that
it's
benefits,
its
probative
value
must
not
be
significantly
outweighed
by
the
waste
of
time,
confusion,
or
redundancy
of
other
evidence
that
might
be
admitted.
those
type
of
considerations
amply
justify
exclusion
of
polygraph
evidence.
polygraph
evidence
is
very
different
from
most
other
kinds
of
scientific
evidence
that
comes
into
the
courtroom.
it
represents
in
essence
the
opinion
of
the
polygraph
examiner
that,
based
on
an
examination
of
the
particular
subject,
he
was
deceptive
or
not
deceptive
on
one
particular
occasion.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
the
government
might
have
had
a
particular
defendant
interviewed
by
a
psychiatrist
if
the
defendant
consented
to
that,
and
the
psychiatrist
might
say,
based
on
my
expert
opinion
and
analysis
of
this
particular
person's
responses
in
the
interview,
i
can
render
an
opinion
that
he
was
quite
certainly
deceptive
or
not
deceptive.
that
kind
of
evidence
is
never
admitted
in
courtrooms
in
this
country.
outside
opinion,
expert
testimony
that
vouches
for
the
credibility
of
a
witness
who
testifies,
is
routinely
excluded
by
both
the
state
and
federal
courts
as
not
being
needed
to
assist
the
trier
of
fact
and,
indeed,
of
impinging
on
the
trier
of
fact's
core
function,
and
it
is
not--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
i
think,
justice
stevens,
that
it
has
a
drawback
from
the
point
of
view
of
courtroom
evidence
that
justifies
its
exclusion
even
on
the
assumption--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
completely
reliable,
i
think
that
no
form
of
scientific
tests
will
ever
be
viewed
by
any--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--even
if
it
had
achieved
that
degree
of
reliability,
which
i
think
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
it
has,
and
there's
no
reason
why
the
president
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
must
assume,
it
still
has
a
different
character--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--than
other
forms
of
scientific
evidence
in
two
key
respects.
the
first
is
that
it
tells
the
trier
of
fact
something
that
we
have
traditionally
entrusted
the
trier
of
fact
to
determine
itself,
namely,
whether
a
particular
witness
should
be
believed.
there
are
many
kinds
of
experts
who
might
be
willing
to
come
into
court
and
render
an
opinion
about
credibility
and
say
yes,
indeed,
i'm
an
expert
on
this.
my
work
has
been
validated
by
numerous
outside
bodies,
and
i
think
that
this
particular
witness
is
credible.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
don't
have
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--no.
it
does
something
quite
different,
justice
stevens,
and
that's
my
second
distinction
of
polygraph
evidence.
it
provides
the
trier
of
fact
with
factual
information
that
it
would
otherwise
have
no
access
to.
an
expert
who
was
able
to
bring
to
the
jury's
attention
specific
scientific
information
that
has
a
degree
of
reliability
that
is
outside
the
realm
of
normal
jurors'
comprehension
serves
a
valid
function
in
the
trial
system,
and
is
unlikely
ever
to
be
excluded
by
a
reasonable
system
of
evidentiary
rules
precisely
because
it
does
enable
the
proof
of
facts
that
could
not
occur
otherwise.
rules
of
evidence
must
be
evenhanded,
and
the
government
bears
the
burden
of
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
a
criminal
case
of
establishing
a
suspect's
guilt,
and
it
is
therefore
extremely
unlikely
that
a
reasonable
system
of
rules
of
evidence
will
ever
exclude
reliable
scientific
testimony
that
is
necessary
to
determine
the
facts.
the
government
would
suffer
far
more
than
any
criminal
defendant
in
such
a
system,
because
we
would
lose
the
ability--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that's
correct,
justice--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
does,
and
i
think
that
that
largely
reflects
the
fact
that
we
take
a
consistent
position
on
this.
we
don't
believe
that
it's
sufficiently
reliable
for
courtroom
evidence,
and
we
think
that
it
performs
a
function
that
the
trier--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
president
is
delegated
authority
under
article
36
of
the
u.c.m.j.,
which
is
reprinted
in
footnote
2
on
page
5
of
our
principal
brief,
and
it
says
that
pretrial,
trial,
and
post
trial
procedures,
including
modes
of
proof,
may
be
prescribed
by
the
president
by
regulations
which,
so
far
as
he
considers
practicable,
apply
principles
of
law
and
the
rules
of
evidence
generally
recognized
in
a
trial
of
criminal
cases
in
the
united
states
district
courts.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
absolutely
right,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
was
not
a
two-way-street
decision.
the
decision
partially
invalidated
rule
707
to
the
extent
that
it
erects
a
per
se
bar
to
the
defendant's
presentation
of
evidence.
the
rule
would
otherwise
remain
in
effect
and
bar
the
government
from
introducing
it,
but
i
think--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
president
could
change
that.
justice
scalia,
the
president
could
certainly
change
it,
but
i
think
it's
important
to
emphasize
here
that
the
department
of
justice
in
criminal
trials
in
the
civilian
courts
takes
the
position
that
polygraph
evidence
should
not
be
offered
by
prosecutors
even
when
it
might
arguably
be
of
assistance
to
us,
and
that
it
should
be
opposed
when
presented
by
defense
lawyers,
and
we
do
that
precisely
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
president
relied
on
in
promulgating
rule
707.
the
underlying
scientific
validity
of
polygraph
evidence
has
always
been
a
source
of
extreme
controversy,
and
it
has--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
that
that
assumes
that
there
is
scientific
validity
and
accuracy
to
the
polygraph,
which
we
dispute,
but
more
importantly,
the
system
of
rules
of
evidence
that
we
have
in
courtrooms
specifically
right
now
allows
opinion
evidence
and
reputation
evidence
about
a
trait
of
character
of
a
witness,
but
it
does
not
allow
specific
instances,
and
it
certainly
does
not
allow
a
witness
to
say,
i
know
this
person,
he
did
denied
committing
the
crime
to
me,
and
i
believe
him.
that
kind
of
testimony
is
routinely
disallowed
in
criminal
trials
around--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
character
witness
testifies
only
about
what
the
individual's
reputation--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--as
to
credibility,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
there's
an
important
distinction,
justice
stevens,
and
that
is
the
polygraph
examiner
will
not
render
an
opinion
that
i
believe
that
this
person
is
generally
credible.
he
will
render
an
opinion
that
says,
based
on
physiological
responses
that
i
observed,
and
all
other
information
that
was
available
to
me
in
whatever
hour
and
a
half
i
had
with
this
individual,
i
concluded
that
he
did
not
exhibit
physiological
signs
of
deception
on
this
particular
instance,
and
that
is
akin
to
an
expert
psychiatrist
meeting
with
a
defendant,
interviewing
him,
and
coming
away
with
the
view
that
i
think
this
man
is
credible
when
he
says
that
he
didn't
commit
the
act.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
do,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
recognize
that
the
court
might
view
that
as
a
somewhat
different
case,
and
i
think
that
if,
in
fact,
there
were
a
100-percent
reliable--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think
all
the
court
has
to
do
is
realize
that
this
is
an
area
of
extraordinary
scientific
polarization,
and
that
a
reasonable
system
of
evidentiary
rules
is
entitled
to
deference
in
the
conclusion
that
polygraph
has
not
progressed
to
the
point
where
its
reliability
justifies--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
we
litigate
about
this
in
every
single
case
where
the
defendant
wants
to
present
it.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
that
that
is
certainly
an
additional
point
here.
this
court
is
not
sitting
to
decide--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
i
think
equally
pertinent
is
the
fact
that
we
take
the
position
that
it
should
not
be
admitted
into
evidence.
out
of
court--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--uses
of
investigatory
tools
such
as
the
polygraph,
which
then
do
not
come
into
evidence
because
they
are
either
not
sufficiently
reliable
or
not
needed,
are
common.
in
investigating
a
crime,
we
will
look
at
a
suspect's
arrest
record.
if
we
have
30
potential
suspects,
we
don't
know
who
did
it,
we
will
look
at
what
the
arrest
records
are
of
the
suspects.
those
who
have
arrest
records
may
get
particular
investigatory
focus.
we
don't
admit
arrest
records
into
evidence.
we
will
engage
in
profiling
of
criminal
suspects
of
unsolved
crimes,
where
we
call
upon
various
scientific
disciplines,
such
as
psychiatrists,
forensic
experts,
and
develop
a
profile
of
who
the
likely
criminal
is,
but
we
don't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
want
to
be
clear
about
this,
justice
souter.
the
official
policy
of
most
of
the
users
of
the
polygraph
in
personnel
screening,
which
is
its
main
application,
is
that
the
polygraph
result
itself
is
not
a
basis
for
any
action
one
way
or
the
other.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
not
even
to
hire
or
not
hire,
except
in
extraordinary
circumstances,
and
i
certainly
don't
want
to
say
that
it
never
would
be
relied
on
as
a
sole
factor,
but
it
primarily
is
used
in
personnel
screening
in
this
way:
questions
are
asked.
if
the
examiner
concludes
that
there
is
some
deception,
there
is
an
effort
to
determine
what
the
truth
is
by
further
investigation,
further
questioning
of
the
applicant
and
so
forth.
generally,
problems
can
get
resolved
that
way,
and
it
is
the
entire
body
of
evidence
that
is
developed
in
a
background
check
that
leads
to
a
decision.
the
polygraph
itself
is
not
supposed
to
be
a
tool
used
in
isolation,
and
it
is
distinguishable
to
say
that
in
a
context
where
the
government
is
considering
whether
to
give
access
to
an
individual
for
national
security
purposes
to
use
anything
available
that
might
be
helpful
in
developing
an
accurate
picture
of
an
individual.
it's
quite
another
thing--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
want
to
be
categorical
and
say
that's
as
far
as
the
government
goes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
substantially
in
the
personnel
screening
area
that's
the
use
that's
made.
i
don't--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--in
investigations,
the
polygraph
is
an
extraordinarily
productive
interrogation
tool.
an
enormous
amount
of
confessions
are
given
when
a
suspect
either
fails
a
polygraph
or
believes
that
a
polygraph
is
about
to
smoke
him
out.
i
have
to
say
that
in
that
sense
there
are
examiners
who
believe
that
it
is
entirely
reliable
in
this
respect,
and
that
it's
a
great
interrogation
tool
because
it's
accurate.
there
are
other
people
who
will
say
that,
well,
it's
a
great
placebo.
there
is
a
story
of
a
police
interrogation
in
a
state
system
where
the
police
put
a
colander
on
a
suspect's
head
and
wired
it
up
to
a
xerox
machine,
and
then
pressed
a
button
that
produced
a
picture,
a
little
copy
that
said,
you're
lying,
every
time
the
suspect
answered.
[laughter]
the
suspect
confessed.
so
if
a
suspect
believes
that
the
polygraph
is
accurate
and
is
about
to
catch
him,
then
it
will
be
very
useful
to
do
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it
has
a
certain
use
in
that
respect
that
would
suggest
that
the
government
continues
to
use
it,
but
at
the
same
time,
it's
not
arbitrary
to
say
that,
look,
not
everything
that
we
do
in
the
investigatory
phase
should
come
into
admission
in
evidence.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
my
understanding,
justice
kennedy,
is
that
in
the...
certain
national
security
agencies
if
you're
not
willing
to
take
a
polygraph,
then
you
won't
be
able
to
work
at
that
agency.
in
the
department
of
defense,
for
example,
you
may
be
transferred
to
an
equivalent
job
that
doesn't
require
access
to
particular
national
security
information,
but
you
won't
be
terminated.
and
congress,
of
course,
which
has
addressed
extensively
the
problem
of
polygraph
reliability,
has
banned
most
of
its
uses
entirely
in
the
private
sector
in
large
part
because
of
concerns
about
its
reliability,
so
the
president,
when
considering
whether
military
courts
martials
ought
to
be
a
forum
for
the
admission
of
polygraph
evidence,
is
entitled
to
take
into
account
the
findings
of
congress
in
enacting
the
polygraph
protection
act,
the
fact
that
27
states
enjoy
a
per
se
rule
that
bars
polygraph
evidence,
and
the
fact
that
until
this
court
decided
daubert,
the
uniform
rule
in
the
federal
courts,
with
the
exception
of
the
eleventh
circuit
in
1989,
was
that
polygraph
evidence
is
per
se
inadmissible.
and
even
after
daubert
has
been
decided,
and
several
federal
courts
have
reconsidered
whether
it
is
appropriate
to
have
a
per
se
rule
and
have
opted
some
case-by-case
litigation,
polygraph
evidence
is
rarely
being
admitted
in
criminal
trials
in
the
civilian
courts,
by
and
large
because
the
judges
are
concluding
that
either
it
will
not
assist
the
trier
of
fact,
or
it
is
unreliable
either
in
a
particular
instance
or
across
the
board,
or
because
traditional
rule
403
balancing
considerations
justify
the
exclusion
of
the
evidence
because
it's
not
really
needed.
i
think
that
the
president
is
certainly
in
a
position
to
take
all
of
that
into
account
and
to
conclude
that
the
military
courts,
of
all
places,
should
not
be
a
place
where
experimentation
with
new
evidence
is
to
be
carried
out.
if
there
ever
came
a
time
when
experience
in
the
civilian
courts
revealed
that
the
polygraph
was
a
vital
engine
for
getting
out
the
truth,
and
that
it
ought
to
be
part
of
our
criminal
trial
process,
i'm
quite
sure
that
the
president
or
an
appropriate
rulemaking
authority
would
recommend
reconsideration
of
rule
707.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
justice
ginsburg,
i
wouldn't
want
to
disparage
the
ability
of
the
courts
martial
members
to
understand
and
deal
appropriately
with
scientific
evidence,
but
it
is
still
true
that
the
military
conducts
an
inordinate
number
of
court
martial
proceedings
around
the
world.
these
proceedings
in
which,
under
daubert,
litigants
have
attempted
to
admit
polygraph
evidence
usually
involve
extensive
evidentiary
hearings
back
and
forth
with
experts
testifying
at
great
length
about
the
supposed
merits
of
the
polygraph
while
other
experts
come
forward
and
testify
about
the
demerits
of
the
polygraph.
one
recent
hearing
that
was
carried
out
under
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
decision
in
scheffer
took
3
days.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
justice
kennedy,
and
i
don't
disagree
with
that
submission.
my
point
is
the
different
one,
in
that
polygraph
evidence
simply
doesn't
have
a
history
of
use
in
the
civilian
courts
in
this
country.
it
is
in
an
experimental
phase
in
the
federal
courts.
massachusetts,
which
had
a
15--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
triers
of
fact
may
or
may
not
be
superior
in
the
military,
but
the
point
is
that
this
particular
form
of
evidence,
unlike
most
other
forms
of
evidence,
doesn't
have
a
track
record.
in
fact--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--mr.
chief
justice,
that
is
certainly
an
additional
consideration
that
supports
the
rule
here.
[laughter]
--happy
to
accept
that.
what
does
distinguish
polygraph
evidence,
again,
from
the
other
kinds
of
scientific
evidence
or
ultimate
opinion
evidence
that
might
come
in
in
these
proceedings
is
that
it's
about
credibility.
it's
an
out-of-court
opinion
based
on
one
experience,
or
exposure
to
the
defendant
that
says
that
he
was
not
credible
or
he
was
credible
on
this
particular
occasion,
and
it's
not
a
form
of
evidence
that
is
particularly
necessary,
and
it
has
high
costs
as
far
as
the
litigation
of
the
reliability
of
the
polygraph
whenever
it
is
admitted.
i
would
like
to
save
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
fundamental
unreliability
of
polygraph
evidence
is
underscored
not
only
for
the
reasons
that
justice
breyer
adverted
to,
but
also
because
of
the
possibility
that
countermeasures
can
defeat
any
test.
any
individual
who
wants
to
can
go
on
the
internet
and
download
a
book
called
"beat
the
box:
the
insider's
guide
to
outwitting
the
lie
detector.
"
and
studies
have
shown
that
with
about
a
half
an
hour
of
education
in
how
to
outwit
the
lie
detector
test,
a
suspect
can
do
that
by
provoking
physiological
responses
that
fool
the
examiner
by
measures
as
easily
as
pressing
his
toes
against
the
ground
or
biting
his
tongue
when
asked
particular
questions.
those
kinds
of
ways
of
skewing
any
reliability
that
polygraph
might
otherwise
have
make
it
clear
that
the
examiner
can
never
be
confident
to
the
level
that
should
be
required
before
this
form
of
evidence
is
admitted
in
a
criminal
trial.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
