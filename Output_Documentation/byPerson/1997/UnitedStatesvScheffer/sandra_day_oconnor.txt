justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
is
it
handled
in
other
jurisdictions
where
there's
no
per
se
rule
in
effect?
is
it
treated
like
any
other
bit
of
scientific
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
from
your
research
no
state
is
treating
it
like
other
expert
testimony,
in
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
even
new
mexico
doesn't
follow
the
typical
expert
testimony
approach.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
rule
cuts
both
ways,
because
there
might
be
times
when
the
government
would
like
to
produce
a
polygraph
test
in
court
because
it
shows
the
defendant
is
lying.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
under
the
military
rule,
the
government
can't
do
that.
so
it
cuts
both
ways
here,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what...
under
what
authority
did
the
president
adopt
the
rule?
what
is
the
provision
that
says
the
president
may
adopt
these
evidentiary
rules?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
your
rule
extend
to
a
crucial
defense
witness
as
well,
whose
credibility
is
attacked?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
here
is...
here
is
the
state,
has
the
burden
of
proof,
brings
in
a
crucial
witness,
who
says,
i
saw
the
defendant
stab
the
victim.
and
there's
a
polygraph
test
that
might
be
favorable
to
the
defense
of
this
witness.
would
your
rule
encompass
that
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
what
would
your
position
be,
logically?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
from
the
position
you're
taking
here,
it's
part
of
the
defense?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
critical.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
is
the
eyewitness.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let...
let
me
ask
you.
