ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
airman
scheffer's
polygraph
examination
was
one
of
34,788
polygraph
examinations
conducted
by
the
department
of
defense
in
fiscal
year
1992.
although
department
of
defense
personnel
rely
on
polygraph
results
in
matters
of
national
security,
military
rule
of
evidence
707
automatically
predetermines,
without
any
evidentiary
hearing
whatsoever,
that
the
results
of
airman
scheffer's
examination
were
both
unreliable
and
a
waste
of
the
court's
time.
despite
the
fact
that
polygraph
examinations
are
used
in
the
ordinary
course
of
government
business,
the
rule
further
predetermined
that
the
military
officers
who
sat
in
airman
scheffer's
panel
were
incapable
of
properly
using
or
evaluating
these
results,
even
with
proper
cautionary
instructions
from
the
military
judge.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
no,
your
honor--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--no,
your
honor,
they're
very
different
uses,
but...
but
they
are
also
very
important
uses.
they're
used
for
counterintelligence
operations,
where
it's
absolutely
critical
that
we
know,
you
know,
national
security
issues.
they're
used
in
whether
or
not
people
are
going
to
have
sensitive
compartmented
access
to
the
secrets
of
the
nation.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
and
i
understand
this
is
a
different
scenario--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
what
the
uses
establish,
your
honor,
we
would
submit,
is
this...
if
this
polygraph
were
so
unreliable,
why
are
millions
of
tax
dollars
being
spent
for
it?
it
has
a
certain
level
of
reliability
or
we
would
not
be
able
to
use
it.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
well,
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
it's
at
least
as
reliable
enough...
well...
well,
first
off,
on
sending
people
to
jail,
the
use
we're
talking
about
here
is
basically
coming
in,
in
an
exculpatory
sense,
not
in
an
inculpatory
sense.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor,
you're
absolutely
right.
if...
if
the
rulemaker
were
to
take
707
off
the
books,
which
they
would
have
to
do,
because,
right
now,
we
just
have
a
very
narrow
constitutionally
required
exception,
but
if
the
rulemaker
were
to
take
rule
707
off
the
books,
the
potential
for
inculpatory
results
would
come
in.
now,
we
would
submit
that
would
come
in,
in
a
parallel
sense.
for
example,
in
this
case,
the
defendant
took
the
stand.
he
testified.
his
credibility
was
attacked.
and
it
was
brought
in
to
bolster
his
credibility.
we
would
submit
that
the
parallel
right,
then,
would
be
for
when
a
defendant
who
takes
the
stand
has
taken
a
government
polygraph
and
failed...
that
that
could
perhaps
come
in
to
impeach
his
credibility.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
it
would--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
specifically
limited
their
holding
to
a
polygraph
examination
of
the
defendant.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
your
honor--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--right.
your
honor,
it
would
depend
on
exactly
how
critical
it
was.
and--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--i...
i--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--your
honor,
then
i
would
say
you
would
have
to...
you
would
have
to
do
the
same
balancing
we're
doing
here.
if
it's
a
critical...
critical
favorable
evidence
for
the
defense,
we
would
have
to
look
at
the
rule
and
look
at
the
basis
for
the
rule,
and
determine
if
in
fact--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--it
would
call
for
evidentiary
hearings
where
there
was
an
exculpatory
polygraph,
your
honor,
or
one
in
favor
of
the
defense.
but
bear
in
mind
the
net
picture.
the
government
focuses
a
great
deal
on
the
individual
cases
where
the
polygraph
evidence
comes
up.
but...
but
these
cases
are
few
and
far
between.
the
greater
weight
of
cases,
where
you
have
an
exculpatory
polygraph,
the
military
convening
authority
knows
that.
and,
many
times,
based
on
that,
elects
not
to
take
the
case
to
trial
at
all.
and
if
the...
if
he
knew
that
those
results
were
admissible,
that's
very
much
a
factor.
as
judge
gerky
pointed
out
for
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
in
his
opinion,
look
at
the
overall
effect
on
military
justice
with
this
rule.
it's
the
rare
case
that's
going
to
come
in
and
have
the
3-day
hearing.
most
of
the
cases,
it's
going
to
either--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--be
disposed
of
pretrial--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--yes,
your
honor,
it
does
right
now,
as
well.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
i
would
not
think
so.
and...
and
the
other
effect,
your
honor,
is,
oftentimes,
when
someone
fails
a
polygraph,
if
they're
truly
guilty,
it
is
a
great
confession
inducer,
if
the
government
as
quite
straightforwardly
told
you.
and
also
it
pushes
sometimes
the
defendant
into
actually
pleading
guilty,
which
is
far
more
expedient
as
well.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
well,
your
honor,
a...
a
couple
of
points.
first
off,
in
the
military,
it's...
it's
done
in
what's
called
an
article
39(a)
session.
so
the
military
judge
would
sort
much
of
that
out
prior
to
it
going
to
the
jury.
and
he
has...
of
course,
he
applies
403,
which
is
the
same
rule
that
you
have
in
the--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
basically--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--yes,
your
honor,
but
a
lot
of--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
at
the
preliminary
hearing,
under...
on
102,
he
is
going
to
make
a
determination
of
whether
or
not
it
should
even
go
to
the
jury,
like
was
done
in
this--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--yes,
your
honor,
they
certainly
could.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
i--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--no...
no,
your
honor,
because
at
least...
the...
the
problem
with
this
rule
is
there's
no
exceptions,
no
matter
how
qualified.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
as
long
as
the
standards
were
not
arbitrary
and
disproportionate,
your
honor,
we
would...
we
would
not
be
doing
that.
one
of
the
critical
things
about
this
case
that's
so
ironic
is
this
is
a
case
that,
if
ever
there
were
indicia
of
reliability,
we'd
have
it.
even
the
worst
critics
of
polygraph
will...
will
tell
you
that
much
of
the...
whether
or
not
the
test
is
reliable
depends
on
the
examiner,
his
qualifications
and
his
training.
and
much
of
what
the
states
complain
of
in
their
amicus
brief
is
the
problem,
then,
in
the
states:
there
is
no
common
training
base
and
there's
no
standardized
procedures.
in--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
your
honor--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
but
please
understand,
we
are
not
asking
the
supreme
court
to
hold
that
this
test
should
have
been
admitted,
or
that
any
test
of
any
defendant
anywhere
in
the
nation
be
admitted;
only
that
they
have
a
chance
to
lay
their
evidentiary
foundation,
and
let
the
judge
evaluate
it.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
ma'am.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
your
honor,
we
submit
no.
and
on
this
case,
this
wasn't
a
test
that
this
defendant
asked
for.
that's
another
thing
to
bear
in
mind.
the
government
wanted
this
test
done.
and
they
went
to
him.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
your
honor,
he
could
hire
someone
on
his
own.
i
don't
think
it
establishes
a
constitutional
right
for
the
government
to
manufacture
exculpatory
evidence.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
but,
again,
our
position
is--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--not
that
it
must
be
admitted...
simply
that
he
has
the
opportunity
for
his
hearing,
for
his
day
in
court.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
to
show
that
his
test
was
reliable.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
well,
your
honor--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
your
honor...
and...
and...
and
that
is
a
tough
issue.
but
looking
at--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well...
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
and
perhaps
not.
because
the
other
experts
that
we're
shutting
the
door
on
giving
truth
testimony,
a
lot
of
times
the
most
common
example
is
the
child
accommodation
syndrome,
where
you
bring
in
a
clinical
social
worker
who
treats
abused
children,
their
area
of
expertise
is
treating
abused
children.
and
then,
the
types
of
cases
where
that
ultimate
truth
testimony
is
precluded
is
with
that
kind
of
expert.
well,
we
would
submit,
the
difference
with
the
polygraph,
and
of
course
you
have
to
accord
some
reliability
to
it,
is
that
this
person's
expertise
is
in
using
a
scientific
machine
and
a...
a
tested
theory
and
a
methodology
to
arrive
at
a
credibility
determination.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor,
the...
the
courts
don't
allow
that
now.
and...
and
i...
i
agree
with
you
that
the
theory
would
seem
to
apply
to
that
as
well.
and
oftentimes
it
comes
extremely
close.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
it's
a
hairline
difference
between
what
they
actually
can
get
in.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
would
think
that
the...
the...
whether
or
not
it's
a
sea
change
is
going
to
depend
on
how
narrowly
or
broadly
this
court
chooses
to
view
this.
because
if
you
look
at
it
from
a
standpoint
of
a
polygrapher
being
someone
who
has
specialized
expertise
in
judging
credibility,
and
look
at
the
others
as
their
specialized
expertise
in
perhaps
treating
children
or
victims,
there
could
be
differentiations
made.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
well,
your
honor,
i'm
glad...
i'm
glad
you
mentioned
the
hearsay,
because
the
thing
with
the
other
evidentiary
rules,
designed
to
ensure
reliability
and
other
reasons,
all
of
them
have
exceptions.
hearsay
does.
and--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--and...
and
if
there
is
a
case,
i
believe,
where
the
defense
thinks
their
case
is
strong
enough
and
there's
enough
indicia
of
reliability,
they
will
probably
make
a
proffer,
under
the
residual
exception.
even
privilege
rules
have
exceptions
when
the
policy
reasons
that
underpin
them
aren't
at
issue.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
rules
that
are
there
now
have
existing
exceptions.
all
we
are
asking
for
is--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
your
honor,
what
we're
saying,
basically,
is,
one,
when...
when
a
defendant's
constitutional
rights
are
clearly
at
issue,
where
he
has
a
sixth...
an
arguable
sixth
amendment
right
that's
at
issue,
a
per
se
rule...
you...
you
have
to
see
if
it
apply...
if
the
reasons
for
the
per
se
rule
apply
in
his
case.
that's
what
rock
basically
said:
wholesale
inadmissibility
is
going
to
be
arbitrary.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
but
the
underpinnings
of
rock,
it
seems
that
it
would
apply
with
equal
force.
in
fact,
i
think,
in
a...
in...
in
this
court's
opinion
in
another
case...
which
escapes
me...
but...
but,
basically,
the
court
said
that
in
rock--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--okay.
the
other
case...
in
taylor
v.
illinois...
in
a
footnote,
the
court
said:
although
in
rock
we
were
addressing
the
specific
issue
of
the
defendant's
right
to
offer
testimony,
it
derived
its
standard
from
general
compulsory
process
case
law
on
the
theory
that
the
right
to
present
one's
own
testimony
extended
at
least
as
far
as
a
right
to
present
testimony
of
others.
i
see
nothing
constitutionally
in
rock
that
would
say
it
could
not
apply
with
equal
force
to
someone
other
than
the
defendant's
testimony.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
[laughter]
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
your
honor,
i
don't--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
your
honor,
to
me,
the...
the
most
perplexing
argument
is
this
idea
that
the
jury
can
determine
credibility
and
the
polygraph
usurps
their
function.
it
is
one
tool
they
use.
it
is
simply
one
piece
of
the
puzzle.
and
military
juries
especially,
they
balance
things
all
the
time
and
weigh
competing
interests
to
make
important
decisions.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
well...
well,
your
honor,
we...
we
submit
that
it's
not
unnecessary.
and
in
airman
scheffer's
case,
it
would
be
particularly
helpful
to
a
jury.
credibility
was
the
issue
in
this
case.
twenty-one
times,
in
closing
argument
alone,
he
was
called
a
liar
or
said
his
credibility
was
lacking,
even
while
the
trial
counsel
knew
he'd
passed
this
government-initiated
polygraph.
and
interestingly,
the
government
brought
in
evidence
of
his
external
physical
manifestations
going
to
credibility.
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
from
special
agent
shilaikis,
when
they...
when
airman
scheffer
came
in,
and
he
explained
what
happened
to
him
the
night
before
the
urinalysis,
they
elicited
from
their
witness,
well,
what
was
his
demeanor
when
he
testified?
well,
he
was
nervous.
he
used
a
fast
rate
of
speech.
now,
arguably,
that
went
to
whether
drugs
were
in
his
system
or
credibility.
but
reading
the
record,
it's
clear,
they're
trying
to
use
evidence
to
go
to
his
credibility.
as
one
judge
from
the
air
force
court
of
criminal
appeals
said
in
this
case,
airman
scheffer's
credibility
was
the
whole
ball
game.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
no,
your
honor,
they
were
not.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
your
honor,
i'm
not
familiar
with
state
proceedings
enough
to
answer
that.
i
can
tell
you
that,
in
military
proceedings,
that
they
are
called.
and
although
they
are
not
permitted
to
say,
i
believe
the
witness,
everything
they're
saying
is
basically
saying,
i
believe
the
witness,
without
using
those
words.
it's
very,
very
close.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
not
as
to
the
truthfulness,
your
honor.
but...
but
demeanor
and...
and
everything
else,
and
then
will
bring
in
experts,
who
talk
about
child
abuse
accommodation
syndrome
and
whether
or
not
what
the
child
said
to
the
caretaker
would
or
would
not
be
consistent
with
a
child
who
was
fabricating
or
involved
in
fantasy
or
telling
the
truth.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes.
and...
and,
often,
independent
proof
is
one
of
the
problems.
and
it
is
more
the...
the
accuracy
rates
are
somewhat
less
in
proving
that
an
innocent
person
is
telling
the
truth.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
your
honor--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--yes,
your
honor.
and...
and
exactly
what
you
said,
your
honor.
they
do
do
laboratory
studies.
and
a
great
weight
of
the...
the...
the
basis
for
these
cred...
these
reliability
estimates
come
from
laboratory
studies.
they
also
do
real-life
studies.
and
what
they'll
do
is
they'll
go
back
and
review
cases
in
which
someone
subsequently
confessed
or
some
other
person
subsequently
confessed.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
and...
and
that's
one
of
the
problems
with
nailing
it
down.
but--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--it
was
a
dissent,
your
honor.
and
i
should
have
specified.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
i
apologize,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
well,
your
honor,
that
came
from
a
study...
a
survey
that
was
conducted
by
dr.
licken...
dr.
lykken...
i'm
not
sure
which
the
correct
way
was.
the
study
has
been
called
into
question
by
the
amicus
brief
that
we
have
done
by
the
committee
for
concerned
social
scientists.
basically,
they...
they...
obviously,
it
is
polarized.
there's
no
doubt
about
that.
dr.
raskin
and
dr.
honts
and
some
other
scientists
talk
about
this
study
that
the
government
relies
on,
and
says
less
than
one-third
said
that.
but
there
were
some
problems
with
the
survey
that
they
point
out.
they...
they...
to
question
whether
it
was
a
random
sampling,
the
context
that
the
survey
was
sent
out
under.
apparently,
it
had
a
cover
letter
that
dealt
with
the
o.j.
simpson
case.
it
asked
them
about
legal
implications.
and
we
would
submit
that
there
are
two
other
surveys
that
are
out
there
that
show
very
different
results
from
that.
in
fact,
two
other
surveys...
one
done
by
gallup
in
1982,
i
believe,
and...
and
another
survey
done
by
a
dr.
amato,
both
show
that
about
two-thirds
of
that
same
group
would
support
the
polygraph
being
used,
at
least
in
conjunction
with...
as
one
piece,
with
other
evidence,
in...
in
making
this
type
of
determination.
and
the
last
survey
that
they
reference
in
their
brief
was
conducted
by
someone
who
is
noted
for
being
almost
a
vitriolic
critic
of
polygraph
evidence.
so
there's...
again,
it's
a
polarized
thing
and
there's
viewpoints
on
either
side.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
well,
your
honor,
i...
i
wouldn't
think
that
the
sixth
amendment
would
be
implicated
in
a
civil
case.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
your
honor--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
your
honor,
it's
my
understanding
that...
that
it
does
come
in,
in
civil
trials,
even
in
some
jurisdictions
that
don't
allow
it
in
criminal.
i'm
not
conversant
enough
in
federal
civil
practice
to
say--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
but...
but,
again,
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
hold
it
has
to
be
admitted.
only
let
a
person
show--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--in
his
case.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
absolutely,
your
honor.
and
that's
why
we're
not
asking
this
court
to
hold
that.
we're
simply
saying,
let
the
military
courts,
like
the
vast
majority
of
the
federal
circuits
do,
let
the
trial
judge
hear
the
evidence.
let
him
do
his
403
balancing.
let
him
see,
and...
and
make
a
determination.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
yes,
we
do.
and...
and...
and
we...
and
we,
of
course,
do
assert
that.
and...
and
what's
ironic
is
the
reasons
that
are
adduced
here
for
allowing
poly...
keeping
polygraphs
out
make
less
sense
in
the
military
context
than
they
do
in
the
civilian.
we...
the...
the
states--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--yes.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
however,
in
this
court,
looking
at
it,
such
a
limiting
could
be
done.
of
course,
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--well,
basically,
the
reasons
that
are
problems
for
a
lot
of
the
states
are
not
present
for
us.
if
you
look
at
their
amicus
brief,
they
cite
things
like
there's
no
standardized
training
for
polygraphers.
much
of
the
reliability
depends
on
the
qualifications
and
training
of
the
examiner.
the
states,
unlike
the
department
of
defense,
do
not
have
the
department
of
defense
polygraph
institute.
they
don't
have
standardized
equipment.
they
don't
have
standardized
protocol.
they
don't
have
two
layers
of
independent
review
above
the
polygrapher.
we
have
protections
that
make
our
tests
more
reliable,
more
trustworthy,
that
don't
exist
in
the
states,
which
would
be
a
basis
for
this
court
not
to
apply
this
case
beyond
the...
the
military.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
argument
would
be
on
the...
as
far
as
the
states,
that
the
government
reasons
are
not
arbitrary.
which
they
are
in
the
military
and
which
they
are
in
airman
scheffer's
case
specifically...
arbitrary
or
disproportionate.
because
we
have
safeguards
in
our
system
that
they
don't
have
that
make
these
rules
arbitrary
and
disproportionate,
and
certainly
in
airman
scheffer's
case.
even
the
thing
about
the
waste
of
time
and
everything
else
is--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--they
would--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--if
they
wanted
to
throw
their...
their
thou--
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
--hundreds
of
thousands
of
polygraphs
into
disarray.
ms.
kim
l.
sheffield
and...
and,
you
know,
what's
interesting
about
the
colander
theory
is
that
confession
would
be
admissible.
but
if
an
individual
defendant
goes
through
this
grueling
process,
designed
to
elicit
confessions,
and
he's
been
there,
done
that,
and
doesn't
confess,
he
can--
