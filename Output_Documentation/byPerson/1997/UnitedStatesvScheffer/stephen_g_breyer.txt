justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how...
how
would
you
avoid
the
endless
hearings
that
would...
or
the
disputes
before
the
jury
about
whether
the
polygraph
is
given
in
the
best
possible
way,
of
whether
it
is
in
fact,
in
this
instance,
how
probative,
of
whether
or
not
polygraphs,
in
general,
are
reliable
or
even
if
they
are,
in
general,
often
reliable,
whether
this
is
the
kind
of
one
that
is
really
that
reliable
or
not,
all
of
which,
before
a
finder
of
fact
that's
not
necessarily
sophisticated
in
scientific
matters?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
is
there
any
basis
in
the
law...
suppose
we
adopted
your
reliability
test.
now,
make
it
as
strict
as
you
want.
if
the
supreme
court
says
that
the
constitution
requires
the
defendant
to
have
a
right
to
put
those
results
into
evidence,
i
guess,
then,
states
could
say,
well,
we
will
permit
prosecutors
to
do
the
same.
after
all,
if
it's
that
reliable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
would
be
no
rule
of
law
that
i'm
aware
of
that
would
stop
it.
but
i'm
raising
it
because
i
think...
i
don't
see
how
it
could
be...
you
would
prevent,
in
practice,
what
i'd
call
tit
for
tat,
or
whatever--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--the...
the
prosecution...
defense
can
do
it,
the
prosecution
can
do
it.
and
so,
pretty
soon,
we
have
a
contest
of...
of
lie
detector
experts,
one
for
the
prosecution
and
one
for
the
defense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
slightly
curious
how
they
know
what...
whether
these
are
reliable
or
not.
i
take
it
the
question
is
whether
a
person
who
says
"i'm
innocent"
is
really
guilty.
and
then
we
have
these
numbers
in
the
brief
that
say,
well,
it's
90
percent
of
the
time.
how
would
anyone
know
that?
i
mean,
how...
how...
you
have
somebody
who
says
"i'm
innocent".
how,
in
some
test
or
something,
do
they
know
wheth...
whether
he...
how
do
they
know,
independently,
he's
guilty?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
my
question
is,
how
do
they
get
these
numbers,
the
accuracy
rate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
you'd
have
to
have,
like,
a
laboratory
or
something.
i
guess
everybody
would
know
it
would
be
like
a
game.
so
i
guess
it's
a
question
whether
a
game
replicates
reality.
and
if
you
go
outside
the
laboratory,
to
the
field,
how
does
anybody
know
what
the
truth
is
to
make
this
accuracy
estimate?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yeah,
but
a
confession
wouldn't
work
in
a
case
where
a
person
is
innocent.
there
would
be
very...
there
would
be
a
handful
of
cases
in
which
the
person
was
really
guilty
and
he
confessed.
but
there
might
be
a
lot
of
cases
where
he's
really
guilty
and
he
didn't
confess.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
how
would
you
know
in...
how
would
you
ever...
how
do
they
ever
go
about
figuring
this
out?
