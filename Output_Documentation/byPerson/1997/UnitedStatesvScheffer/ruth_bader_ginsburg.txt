mr.
dreeben,
when
the
government
itself
is
responsible
for
the
polygraph,
and
the
government
is
attacking
the
credibility
of
the
defendant,
isn't
that
a
different
situation?
this
doesn't
have
to
be
all
or
nothing,
but
at
least
as
in
this
case,
where
the
government
itself
chose
to
administer
a
polygraph
test
and
in
prosecuting
attacked
the
credibility
of
the
defendant,
when
you
have
those
two
things,
why
isn't
that
enough
to
trigger
a
constitutional
concern?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
dreeben,
as
to
the
truth-telling
identification
that
the
polygraph
is
offered
for,
it's
been
traditionally
allowed
to
have
a
character
witness
for
defendants.
defendant
testifies
and
he
has
a
character
witness
that
testifies
to
his
reputation
in
the
community
for
truth-telling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
isn't
the
polygraph
far
more
reliable
than
just
any
character
witness
the
defendant
wants
to
present?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
dreeben,
why
doesn't
it
work
the
other
way
with
respect
to
the
military
courts,
because
my
understanding
is
that
the
courts
martial,
the
equivalent
to
the
jurors,
are
of
a
certain
high
level,
perhaps
higher
than
the
ordinary
jury
that
would
sit
in
a
federal
court
in
a
criminal
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
i
think
you
can't
just
close
the
door
at
that
point.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
because
the
president
would
be
free
to
say,
okay,
all
bets
are
off,
and
the
next
case,
there
is
no
rule.
it's
the
same
government
examiner
that
has
given
the
polygraph.
and
there
is
an
inculpatory
result.
and
the
government
says,
fine.
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
this
is
a
two-way
street,
and
we're
going
to
use
it.
he
gets
on
the
stand.
we're
going
to
say,
he's
a
liar,
and
here's
the
polygraph
to
prove
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
this
case,
it
was
the
govern...
government's
own--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--test.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
we
could
presume
that
that
would
meet
whatever
standards
one
might
set
up.
if
your
position
is
correct,
that
the
defendant
is
entitled
to
use
this
evidence
to
bolster
his
credibility,
then,
in
the
next
case,
suppose
the
government
said,
we're
not
going
to
give
this
person
a
test;
we
think
this
person
could
probably
pass
one.
could
that...
that
defendant
then
insist,
as
a
matter
of
his
sixth
amendment
right,
to
have
the
government
provide
a
polygraph
test,
which
he
could
then
use
in
his
defense?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that
the
argument
that
mr.
dreeben
was
making
was
not
that
it
usurps
the
jury's
function,
but
that
it's
unnecessary,
since
juries,
from
time
immemorial,
have
been
judging
questions
of
credibility.
i
thought
his
argument
was,
on
that
branch,
it's
unnecessary
and
it's
very
costly.
