justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
daubert,
of
course,
is
in
the
civil
context,
but
would
you
say
that
the
petitioner's...
pardon
me,
that
the
respondent's
position
here
is
consistent
generally
with
what
we
held
in
daubert?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
recognize
the
difference.
i'm
talking
about
the
thrust
of
the
case
and
what
it
held,
which
was
to
undercut
the
frye-type
rule
which
is
really
being
applied
by
the
military
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
recognize
one's
civil,
one's
criminal,
one's
constitutional,
one's
evidence,
but
so
far
as
the
thrust
of
what
the
court
was
talking
about
so
far
as
sound
management
of
trials,
isn't
there
some
inconsistency
with
your
position
in
daubert?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
instances
in
which
an
employee
is
terminated
for
failure
to
take
a
polygraph,
government
employment?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
you're
somewhat
deflecting
the
thrust
of
justice
ginsburg's
question,
and
i
notice
this
in
your
brief,
too.
you
talk
about
danger
of
confusion
of
the
jury.
the
military
rules
allow
conclusions
of
experts
on
the
very
premise
that
military
juries
are
somewhat
more
sophisticated
than
most
juries.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
may
be
true,
but
it
doesn't
go
to
the
point
of
the
differences
in
the
trier
of
fact
justice
ginsburg
was
referring
to.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
they...
they
weren't
purporting
to
be
experts,
reaching
a
conclusion
as
to
credibility?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
are
there
other
instances
in
which
experts,
as
justice
stevens
indicated,
psychologists
or
psych...
psychiatrists,
are
called
to...
to
testify
about
credibility?
does
this
ever
happen
in...
in
state
proceedings?
