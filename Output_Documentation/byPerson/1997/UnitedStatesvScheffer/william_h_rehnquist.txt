we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1133,
united
states
v.
edward
g.
scheffer.
mr.
dreeben.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
would
that
have
been
the...
was
that
the
consequence
of
the
armed
forces
court
of
appeals
opinion
here
that
the
validity
of
each
individual
polygraph
examination
had
to
be
tested
in
each
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
getting
back
to
your
colloquy
with
justice
o'connor
just
a
moment
ago,
i
think
perhaps
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
might
have
taken
a
different
view
if
the
government
had
sought
to
introduce
the
polygraph
test,
because
they
seem
to
base
their
constitutional
decision
on
the
defendant's
right
to
call
witnesses
in
his
favor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--we
don't
ordinarily
make
findings
of
fact
on
the
basis
of
briefs,
i
guess.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
suppose
one
could
argue
that
if
the
triers
of
fact
are
indeed
superior,
they
need
less
help
from
this
sort
of
evidence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
dreeben.
ms.
sheffield,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we'd
have
a
big
evidentiary
hearing
in
every
case
where
the
polygraph
was
used?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
how...
how
about
a
defendant,
before
the
case
is
brought,
who
fails
a
polygraph
test;
there
may
be
other
reasons
now
why
the...
the...
the
armed
forces
would
say,
let's
not
bring
this
guy
to
trial.
but
this
gives
them
an
added
sling
in
their
bow,
an
added
arrow
in
their
bow,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
don't
you
think
that
might
lead
to
more
cases
being
brought?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yet...
but
your
point
in...
in
response
to
some
of
the
questions,
ms.
sheffield,
has
been,
you
know,
we
don't
ask
that
it
be
admitted,
we
just
ask
that
it
be
submitted
to
a
judge
to
decide.
but
it
seems
to
me,
following
up
on
justice
souter's
question,
you
could
then
call
into
question
all
of
the
hearsay
rule.
in
other
words,
don't
exclude
hearsay
that...
it
doesn't
come
within
the
traditional
exception,
but
if
it
has
a
lot
of...
it
seems
reliable,
put
people
on
the
stand
and
let
the
judge
decide
whether
it
should
come
in.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course
it
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
nonetheless,
there...
the
rules
tend
to
be
categorical.
they
don't
have
litigation
of
whether
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
or
particular
thing
should
be
admitted,
just
to
be
inquired
into
de
novo
every
time.
because
a
trial
would
last
for
months
if
you
did
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
rock...
rock
was
the
defendant's
own
testimony.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
talking
about
the
other
case
or
about
rock?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that...
you...
you're
entitled,
certainly,
to
take
an
expansive
view
of
rock.
but
i
think
you
should
remember
it
was
a
5
to
4
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
sheffield,
a
moment
ago,
you
were...
you
read
a
quotation
from
taylor
against
illinois.
were
you
quoting
from
the
court
opinion
or
the
dissent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you
should
have
made
that
clear.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
be
a
strange
rule
that
said
you
had
to
admit
it,
even
if
you
found
the
expert
was
a
fraud.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if...
if...
if
we
were
the
co...
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces,
and...
and
there
weren't
any
rule
707
promulgated
by
the
president,
your
presentation
cert...
certainly
would
make
a
great
deal
of
sense.
but
you...
you're
in
the
position
where
it
isn't
just
a
common
law
judgment
on
our
part.
the
president
has
said
this
will
not
come
in.
and
so
you
have
to
say
there's
a
constitutional
principle
that
says
it
has
to
come
in.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
any
way
of...
of
limiting
the
rule
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
armed
forces
to
military
criminal
trials,
as
opposed
to
civilian
criminal
trials?
as
i
read
the...
the
opinion,
there...
there
is
no
effort
to.
i
mean,
it
comes
in
as
a
constitutional
matter,
the
right
to...
for
a
defendant
to
present
its
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how...
how
would
you
suggest
that
we
do
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
then
what...
but
you
would
still
have
to
derive
it
from
the
same
constitutional
principle,
wouldn't
you...
the
right
of
the
defendant
to
call
witnesses
in
his
defense?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
sheffield.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
dreeben,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
the
case
is
submitted.
