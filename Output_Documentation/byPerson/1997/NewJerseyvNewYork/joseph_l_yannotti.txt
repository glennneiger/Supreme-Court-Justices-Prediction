mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
his
final
report
the
special
master
concluded
that
new
york's
jurisdiction
on
ellis
island
was
limited
to
the
island
as
it
existed
in
april
1834,
and
new
jersey
is
sovereign
over
the
portions
of
the
island
created
by
artificial
filling
of
submerged
lands
in
the
years
after
1834.
although
we
take
issue
with
the
amount
of
territory
allocated
to
new
york
and
with
the
recommended
boundary
line
of
the
special
master,
we
would
first
like
to
offer
the
court
our
reasons
why
we
believe
the
special
master's
principal
conclusion
is
legally
sound
and
amply
supported
by
the
record.
first,
the
special
master
correctly
interpreted
the
1834
compact
between
the
states
which
fixed
the
territorial
limits
and
jurisdiction
of
new
jersey
and
new
york
along
their
common
boundary.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
well,
we
certainly
did
place
a
great
deal
of
weight
on
the
holmes'
opinion
and
we
do
think--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well,
they
certainly
did
make
that
argument
below
before
the
special
master.
some
of
the
amici
have
made
that
point.
i
did
not
see
a
direct
attack
on
the
holmes'
opinion
or
request
to
see
it
overruled
in
the
exceptions,
so
i'm
not
sure
that's
an
issue--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--yes,
i
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
that
case
squarely
decides
the
question
of
sovereignty
over
the
submerged
lands.
what
the
court
rejected
in
that
case
was
an
argument
that
all
new
jersey
had
under
the
compact
was
a
right
of
property
under
these
submerged
lands.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
under
article
iii?
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
yes,
well--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well,
justice...
justice
holmes
indicated
in
the
central
railroad
case
that
under
article
ii,
new
york
had
retained
its
present
jurisdiction
of
and
over
ellis
island,
which
he
interpreted
to
mean
was
the
states
intended
to
preserve
the
status
quo
ante,
and
the
status
quo
that
existed
in
1834
was
a
situation
where
ellis
island
was
on
the
new
jersey
side
of
the
boundary,
it
was
a
2-3/4
acres
of
fast
land
to
mean
high
water,
it
was
owned
by
the
federal
government,
who
had
acquired
it
in
1808
from
the
state
of
new
york,
and
it
was
utilized
as
a
military
fort.
new
york,
in
fact,
had
ceded
jurisdiction
to
the
federal
government
in
those
conveyances,
and
retained
only
the
right
to
serve
civil
and
criminal
process,
so
that
was
the
jurisdiction
that
was
retained
by
the
state
of
new
york.
that
was
the...
what
we
contend
was
the
present
jurisdiction
in
1834
when
the
agreement
was
made,
and
moreover,
our
view
is
that
the
states
recognized
that
the
island
then
in
existence
which
was,
as
i
said,
2-3/4
acres,
was
the
ellis
island
that
was
being
addressed
by
the
terms
of
that
compact,
so
i
do--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well,
i
respectfully
argue
that
holmes
was
not
wrong,
and
that
he
reached
the
correct
conclusion.
in
fact,
what
he
did
in
that
opinion
for
the...
for
a
unanimous
court
was
to
base
his
judgment
upon
the
prior
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
of
1870,
which
had
concluded
essentially
that
the
territorial
line
was
the
principal
and
dominant
purpose
of
this
agreement,
that
the
state
of
new
jersey
was
sovereign
on
its
side
of
the
boundaries--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
the
argument
was
made
that
all
new
jersey
had
was
the
sovereign
right
of
property,
and
he
found
that
that
actually
supported
the
notion
that
new
jersey
was
sovereign
in
this
territory,
and
he
said
that
the
ownership
of
submerged
land
was
indicative
of
the
division
of
sovereign
territory
and
actually
furthered
and
supported
the
notion
that
this
was
a
line
not
only
of
territory
but
of
jurisdiction
and
sovereignty,
so
i
think
the...
what
justice
holmes
said--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well,
i
think
it--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--the...
i
think
it's
important
to
focus
also,
not
only
on
that
but
also
on
the
notion
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
waters,
and
i
think
that
is
the
key
element
of
that
article
iii,
because
new
jersey
had
recognized
that
new
york
had
exclusive
jurisdiction,
but
it
was
limited.
it
wasn't
full
sovereign
governmental
authority.
it
was
limited
to
control
of
the
waters,
and
that's
how
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
interpreted
article
iii
in
1870,
to
mean--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--that's
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
well,
our
argument
is
that
that
is
not
the
case,
and
we
rely
in
that
regard
upon,
again,
that
1870
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals,
which
said
that
although
there
was
in
article
iii
a
reference
to
jurisdiction
over
the
submerged
lands,
that
was
merely
subordinate
to
and
in
furtherance
of
the
power
over
the
waters,
and
it
was...
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
gave
it
a
very
limited
reading
in
that
case,
and
in
fact
in
the
1908
decision
by
justice
holmes
the
court
specifically
upheld
the
taxation
of
submerged
lands--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
our
view
of--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--yes.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
well,
again
i
think
the...
we
go
back
to
the
decision
of
the
new
york
court
of
appeals
in
1870,
and
what
the
court
said
was
that
this
was
a
jurisdiction
over
navigation.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
and
once
the
waters
were
filled
there
was
no
basis
upon
which
to
exercise
jurisdiction
over
ships
and
vessels
on
the
water,
that
the
jurisdiction
essentially...
there
was
no
basis
upon
which
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction
when
the
land
was
filled.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
it
does
mean
exclusive
related
to
ships,
related
to
navigation.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
that's
specifically
addressed
in
article
iii,
where
new
york's
jurisdiction
is
recognized,
at
least
to
the
extent--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well,
i
think...
again,
my
point
is
that
this
is
a
jurisdiction
as
it
relates
to
vessels,
and
if
they're
tied
to
a
port
facility
on
the
new
jersey
side
that
creates
an
entirely
different
situation
than
to
have
filled
land,
because
they
cannot--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--that
is
not...
again,
the
request
that
we
sought
relates
to
exercise
of
jurisdiction
on
the
land.
not
on
the
waters,
not
on
boats
who
are
still
on
the
waters
that
may
very
well
be
tied
up
on...
to
a
new
jersey
pier,
or
to
a
portion
of
land
that
is
subject
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
of
new
jersey.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
well,
again
it
relates
to
the--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--it
relates
to
the
subject
matter
of
that
jurisdiction
and
as
it's
been
interpreted
by
the
courts,
that
jurisdiction
relates
to...
the
subject
matter
is
navigation,
pertains
to
vessels
while
they
are
on
the
waters,
and
that
is
the...
that
is
the
limit
there
of
the
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
right.
well,
i
think
this
specific
argument
that's
now
being
offered
with
regard
to
the...
some
residuum
of
article
iii
jurisdiction
over
the
filled
lands
is
not
an
issue
that
was
really
raised
very
much
by
the
state
of
new
york.
it's
only
come
in
now
in
the
context
of
the
exceptions,
so
the
master
did
not
really...
it
was
not
an
argument
that
was
pressed
before
the
special
master.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
well,
i
think
that
essentially
what--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--essentially
what
we
have
been
saying.
you
put
it
better
than
i
did.
but
i
think
the
point
is
that
once
they
are
covered,
once
they
are
filled,
there
is
no...
there
is
no...
nothing
upon
which
to
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
it
is...
it
is...
we
made
it--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well,
that
has
been
our
point,
and
i
do
believe
we
have
that
in
our
brief,
but
it
is
our
argument
that
once
the
lands
were
filled,
that
there
is
no
basis
upon
which
new
york
may
exercise
that
jurisdiction
under
article
iii.
and
let
me
add
further
with
regard
to
these,
what
we
perceive
to
be
sound
interpretations
of
the
compact
that
were
reached
by
the
new
york
court
in
1870,
and
also
by
the
new
jersey
court
of
errors
and
appeals,
our
highest
court,
these
rulings,
which
were
the
basis
upon
justice
holmes'
decision
in
1908
have
been
accepted
by
both
states,
and
they
have...
they
have
become
over
time
the...
a
meeting
of
the
minds
between
these
two
states
as
to
the
meaning
of
this
particular
compact,
and
we
think
for
that
reason,
too,
the
court
should
reaffirm
what
justice
holmes
said
in
his...
in
the
1908
decision
and
apply
that
principle
to
the
submerged
lands
here
once
they
are
filled.
let
me--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well,
in
order
to
determine
the
present
juris--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--well,
present
jurisdiction,
really
in
order
to
ascertain
precisely
the
meaning
of
that
you
have
to
go
back
to
the
situation
as
it
existed
in
1834
to
determine
what
was
the
jurisdiction,
and
at
that
time
new
york
had
virtually
no
jurisdiction.
they
had
ceded
everything
to
the
federal
government,
and
the
island
had
been
used
in
those
days
as
a
military
fort
for
the
exclusive
purposes
of
the
federal
government.
it
was
a
federal
enclave,
and
new
york
had
no
presence
there,
and
new
york
exercised
no
jurisdiction
there,
and
so
therefore
that
is
the
present
jurisdiction.
and
if
you
perceive
that
to
be
a
lower,
some
lesser
element
of
jurisdiction,
it
certainly
is
supported
by
the
factual
record,
which
shows
that
this
was
a
federal
enclave
subject
to
federal
jurisdiction.
the
special
master
also
determined
that
new
york
had
failed
to
establish
its
affirmative
defense
of
prescription
and
acquiescence,
and
on
this
point,
too,
we
think
that
the
special
master's
analysis
was
correct.
we
urge
the
court
to
accept
it.
again,
as
i
mentioned,
this
was
an
island
that
was
under
the
federal
government's
exclusive
control.
this
was
true
prior
to
the
filling
in
1890,
which
commenced
in
1890,
and
it
was
certainly
true
right
on
through
the
period,
the
immigration
period
which
new
york
focuses
on
so
strenuously.
there
was
little
opportunity
for
either
state
to
exercise
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
enclave,
and
our
view
is
that
that
being
the
case,
new
york
could
not
establish
the
requisite
degree
of
government
dominion
and
control
in
order
to
place
new
jersey
on
notice
that
it
was
prescribing
jurisdiction
over
this
territory.
what
is
more,
new
jersey
did
not
acquiesce
in
the
purported
assertion
of
jurisdiction
by
the
state
of
new
york,
and
as
the
record
amply
demonstrates,
there
were
extensive
instances
where
new
jersey
either
took
prescriptive
acts,
or
asserted
claims
to
the
territory
which
were
sufficient
enough
to
establish
new
jersey's
assertion
that
there
was
nonacquiescence
in
new
york's
claims,
so
on
this
point,
too,
we
think
the
special
master
was
correct.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
i
think...
i
understand
from
the
chief
deputy
clerk
that
the
court
does
have
the
map
in
front
of
it
today,
and
that
map
illustrates,
as
does
appendix
k
in
the
special
master's
report,
it
illustrates
this
proposed
boundary
to
which
we've
taken
exception.
as
you
can
see
on
that
map,
the
original
island
to
the
mean
high
water
is
indicated
there,
and
that
is
not
the
line
of
demarcation
that
has
been
recommended
to
the
court
by
the
special
master.
our
view
is
that
the
court's
role--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--north
would
be
to
the
right,
west
would
be
to
the
top
of
that
map.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
and
the
special
master,
of
course,
has
completely
departed
from
the
line,
the
mean
high
water
line
from
1834,
which
is
what
new
jersey
contends
is
the
line
which
should
be
employed.
the
court
has
said
that
when
the
states
make
a
boundary
agreement,
and
when
such
an
agreement
is
approved
by
congress,
that
the...
an
agreement
of
that
sort
is
a
law,
a
federal
law,
and
the
court
is
without
authority
to
depart
from
the
terms
of
that
agreement,
and
regrettably
that
is
what
the
special
master
has
recommended
here.
we
think
that
that
is
not
an
appropriate
exercise
of
the
court's
power
in
this
regard,
that
the
court
should
abide
by
the
boundary
that
was
agreed
to
by
the
states.
if
there
are
practical
concerns
that
relate
to
that
in
its
implementation,
that
remains
to
the
states,
with
the
oversight
of
congress,
to
make
whatever
adjustments
might
be
deemed
appropriate.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
well,
i
think--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
we
must...
you
must
because
that
is
the
essential
role
of
the
court
in
this
case,
to
define
the
boundary.
this
is
a
case
about
boundaries,
not
about
buildings,
and
the
court's--
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
--yes,
they
said
that.
what
the
court
said
in
texas
v.
new
mexico
was
that
once
an
act
of
congress,
an
agreement
like
this
which
is
approved
by
congress,
it
becomes
a
federal
law,
and
the
court
cannot
enter
relief
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
terms
of
that
law,
and
for
that
reason
we
think
that
the
court
is
limited
in
providing
relief
in
this
case
to
the
boundary
that
was
agreed
by
the
states,
and
cannot
employ
practical
considerations
to
write
or
create
a
boundary,
what
the
court
may
perceive
to
be
a
better
boundary.
that
judgment's
already
been
made
by
the
states,
and
recognized
by
congress,
and
we
think
it
ought
to
be
respected
by
the
court.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
it
has
jurisdiction...
a
navigational
jurisdiction
over
the
waters,
and
it
would
pertain
to
vessels,
ships,
and
passengers
as
they
are
on
those
waters
in
new
york
bay
and
the
hudson
river
in
this
particular
area.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
well,
yes.
so
long
as
it's
on
the
waters.
then
new
york
would
have
some
measure
of
jurisdiction
over
that,
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
exclusive
jurisdiction.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
well,
yes.
we're
not
saying
new
jersey
would
have
jurisdiction
over
it,
but
the
exact
parameters
of
it,
the
extent
to
which
they
would
exercise
control,
that
is
not...
has
not
been
elucidated
in
any
particular
decision,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
the
court
needs
to
address
the
full
extent
of
the
jurisdiction
of
new
york
while
a
ship
is
on
the
waters.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
within
the
subject
matter
limitation.
mr.
joseph
l.
yannotti
it
relates
also
to
navigation.
for
example,
the
case
of
state
v.
babcock,
which
was
an
early
decision
by
the
new
jersey
trial
court
in
<eighteen
fifty-two>
[=
1852],
what
happened
in
that
case
was
there
were
vessels
which
were
sunk
onto
the
underwater
land,
and
the...
an
action
was
brought
in
new
jersey
for
criminal...
a
criminal
action
to
prosecute
that,
and
the
court
held
that
that
was
within
the
jurisdiction
of
