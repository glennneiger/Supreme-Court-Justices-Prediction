chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
120
original,
new
jersey
v.
new
york.
mr.
yannotti.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
north
and
what's
south
on
this
map?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
yannotti.
mr.
minear,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
agree
with
justice...
what
difference
does
it
make,
mr.
minear,
at
this
point
in
the
litigation,
if
we
were
to
say
that
we
reject
the
master's
drawing
of
the
boundary
line
because
neither
party
ever
asked
for
it?
i
mean,
presumably
there
could
be
further...
some
sort
of
an
amendment
to
the
complaint
and
they
could
bring
it
up
again.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
it
really
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
they
asked
for
it
or
not.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
really
exclusive
jurisdiction.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
mr.
smirlock,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
do
we
find
that
in
the
papers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
article
ii
doesn't
say
what
you
just
said
in
so
many
words,
certainly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
it
doesn't
say
sovereignty
in
article
second.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--now,
you
made
this
argument
to
the
special
master,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
he
rejected
it,
in
effect.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
wherein
do
you
disagree
with
his
rejection?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
it
could
extend
over,
all
the
way,
right
to
the
new
jersey
shore,
and
even
though
it
ultimately
connected,
the
boundary
then
would
be
the
new
jersey
shore.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
much
of
a
check
and
balance.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
true
of
any
kind
of
fill
you
put
in,
anybody.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
the
common
law
rule
that
avulsion
doesn't
change
boundaries?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i'm
not
at
all
sure
you're
correct
that
that
is...
you're
saying
that
something
is
presumed
to
be
accretion
if
you
don't
know
how
it
happened?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no.
then
it's
not
a
default
rule.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
when
you're
talking
about
what
happens
when
an
island
is
extended
by
landfill,
and
as
justice
scalia
points
out
in
a
number
of
cases
we've
had
to
try
to
analyze
where
were
the
original
boundaries
of
the
island,
that
sort
of
thing,
certainly
if
this
was
a
compact
that
didn't
specify,
you
would
think
that
it
would
follow
the
common
law
rule
that
an
avulsion
doesn't
change
a
boundary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
where...
the
master
disagreed
with
you
about
the
foreseeable
use
of
landfill,
so
you're
arguing
on
a
factual
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
rarely
second-guess
a
master
on
a
factual
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
how
much
opportunity
did
new
jersey
have
to
object
to
some
of
these
things?
i
mean,
to
what
extent
did
it
make
any
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
so
someone
is
identified
as
having
been
born
in
a
hospital
on
ellis
island
and
born
in
new
york,
and
this
somehow
comes
to
the
attention
of
new
jersey,
i
mean,
is...
are...
is
new
jersey
suppose
to
seek
a
correction
of
that
record
to
show
the
person
was
born
in
new
jersey?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
is
a
very...
that's
a
very
abstract
difference
with
no
consequences
to
the
state.
i
mean,
it
isn't
as
if
new
york
and
new
jersey
were
both
seeking
to
tax,
or
something
like
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
i
grant
you,
but
it
seems
to
me
some
of
the
examples
that
you
give
are
things
where
it
really
wouldn't
have
made
any
difference
in
the
operations
of
the
state.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
really
wasn't
a
very
good
deal
for
new
jersey,
certainly,
if
as
soon
as...
if
they
owned
the
water...
owned
the
land
when
it
was
under
water,
but
as
soon
as
it
emerged
from
the
water
it
went
to
new
york.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
much
value
is
land
that's
under
water?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--answer
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smirlock.
the
case
is
submitted.
