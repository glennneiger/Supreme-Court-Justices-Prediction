so
property
means
jurisdiction
and
exclusive
jurisdiction
doesn't
mean
exclusive
jurisdiction.
justice
antonin
scalia
is...
would
there
have
been
a
clearer
way
to
say
that
one
of
the
states
had
governing
authority--
justice
antonin
scalia
--than
to
use
the
phrase,
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
yannotti,
i'm
a
little
curious
as
to
why
new
jersey
did
not
make
the
argument
which
seems
to
me
available
that
the
compact
only
gives
new
york
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
lands
covered
by
the
hudson,
and
these
lands
are
not
any
more
covered
by
the
hudson.
if
you
read
that
phrase
as
meaning
covered
from
time
to
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you'd
be
home
free.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
did
not
understand
you
as
having
made
that
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
assume
they
can
exercise
control
to
the
maximum
extent
that
any
state
can
ever
exercise
controls.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
our
position
would
be
altered
if
they
had
asked
us
to
redraw
the
boundary?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
see.
i
see--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
your
point.
i
thought
your
point
was
that
if
they
had
asked
us,
we
would
have
the
power.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
can't
think
of
an
original
action
since
i've
been
here
in
which
the
issue
is
not
who
owns
the
land
but
where
one
state
is
simply
suing,
claiming
that
the
other
state
has
no
jurisdiction
over
a
particular
action
over
a
particular
thing.
usually
that
issue
comes
up
in
the
context
of
a
private
party
defending
against
the
asserted
jurisdiction
by
one
state
or
the
other.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand,
but
you're
saying
we
don't
have
to
decide
that
question
now
because
the
states
can
come
back
later
when
there
is
more
factual
context
to
it,
and
i'm
not
entirely
sure
they
can
come
back
later
to
present
us
the
question
of
which
state
has
jurisdiction.
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
it
interesting
that
that
provision
also
uses
the
magic
words,
exclusive
jurisdiction,
which
later
turn
up
in
article
iii,
and
where
they're
used
in
article
second
they
quite
clearly
mean
sovereignty,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
shall
also
retain
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
other
islands--
justice
antonin
scalia
might...
would,
under--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
anchoring
buoys,
i
suppose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--would
be
necessary
if
you're
going
to
maintain
navigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
wait,
couldn't
new
york
condemn
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
new
jersey
just
had
a
property
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
smirlock,
here's
what
troubles
me
about
your
argument.
we
do
not
normally,
when
an
island
is
referred
to
in
a
compact
of
this
sort,
or
in
any
deed,
interpret
that
to
mean,
the
island
as
it
may
exist
from
time
to
time.
i
mean,
that
would
have
solved
a
whole
lot
of
our
cases
if
that's
the
way
we
interpret
a
reference
to
an
island.
all
of
these
avulsion
cases
where
we
have
to
decide,
you
know,
where
was
the
original
island
and
so
forth,
if
we
simply
interpreted
island
to
mean,
as
it
may
exist
from
time
to
time,
all
those
cases
would
go
away.
why
should
we
give
ellis
island
that
strange
meaning
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
the
island
then.
i
mean,
it
might
have
been
fill,
but
that
was
ellis
island
at
that
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
like
ellis
island.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the...
not
over
the
waters
surrounding
staten
island?
justice
antonin
scalia
new
york
didn't
even
have
the
navigation
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
all
of
that
has
less
to
do
with
who
they
thought
owned
it
than
with
whether
the
rates
are
higher
or
lower
and
whether
they're
seeking
union
support
or
not.
don't
you
really
think
that's
what's
driving
all
the
davis-bacon
stuff?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
smirlock,
you
know,
i
think
it's
a
hard
row
to
hoe
to
establish
prescription.
it
really
is
a
very
difficult
thing.
i
guess
i'm
more
sympathetic
to
your
arguments
as
simply
indicative
of
what
the
compact
was
understood
to
mean.
just
as
in
a
normal
contract
interpretation
one
can
look
at
the
parties'
subsequent
behavior
after
the
contract
was
signed,
so
also
i'm
sympathetic
to
the
notion
that
we
can
look
to
new
york
and
new
jersey's
subsequent
behavior
as
indication
of
what
it
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
establish
prescription--
