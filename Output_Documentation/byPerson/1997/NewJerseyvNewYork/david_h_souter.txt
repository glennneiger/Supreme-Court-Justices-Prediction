h.
souter
well,
it
was
control
of
the
waters.
it
also
referred
to
the
submerged
lands.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't
there
a
fair
argument
to
be
made
that
when
the
submerged
lands
become
in
effect
the
basis
for
filled
land,
in
place
of
what
had
been
water
subject
to
new
york's
jurisdiction,
that
that
same
territory
now
newly
created
above
the
ground
becomes
subject
to
the
same
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
we
have
any
choice
at
all?
you
say
we
should.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
it
the
case...
i
thought
your
position
would
be
that
we
must.
justice
david
h.
souter
we
must
because
of
what?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
isn't
it
also
because
we're
bound
by
an
act
of
congress?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
new
jersey's...
as
i
understand
it,
new
jersey's
answer
to
that
argument
is
that
new
york
through
its
courts,
it
already
held
that
the
whole
point
of
that
is
simply
in
effect
a
navigational
commercial
jurisdiction,
and
when
something
was
not
on
or
moving
over
the
water,
that
was
the
end
of
it.
what's
your
response
to
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
landfill
being
the
wharf
on
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
or
at
least
would
have
given
new
york
the
authority
to
stop
it.
