mr.
yannotti,
at
least
as
to
the
land
that
was
once
submerged
and
has
now
been
filled
in,
there
was
a
significant
argument
made
that
holmes
was
wrong,
at
least
to
the
extent
that
he
defined
exclusive
rights
of
property
to
mean
sovereignty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that
part
i
understand,
the
equation
of
boundary
with
sovereignty.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
holmes
also
said
something
about
exclusive
right
of
property.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
know
the
three-way
division
that
was
offered
in
some
of
the
briefs,
of
the
property
right
and
the
public
access
right
and
the
governing
right.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
you
once
more
to
clarify...
i'm
still
fuzzy
about
it...
what
authority
new
york...
what
authority
does
new
york
have
and
enjoy...
those
are
the
words
of
article
third...
as
a
result
of
that
grant
of
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
with
respect
to
the
ferry
going
back
and
forth
to
ellis
island,
new
york
has
control
of
that,
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what's
some
measure?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
sounds
to
me
like
only.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
case
involved
a
variable
boundary,
a
boundary
that
could
be
here
today
and
some
place
else
tomorrow,
as
opposed
to
what
the
special
master
has
done
here.
he
has
fixed
or
recommended
fixing
a
boundary
that
would
not
be
variable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
just
suggesting
that
there's
a
little
space
between
the
washington
v.
oregon
case
and
this
one.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
mr.
minear,
in
view
of
that,
what
practically
is
at
stake?
i
mean,
you
said
the
united
states
has
been
there
since
it
was
a
fort,
and
now,
and
it's
continuing,
so
the
states
want
the
boundary
set,
but
what
consequence
does
that
have
as
long
as
the
united
states
owns
and
exercises
jurisdiction
over
the
island?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
for
example?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so--
--but
that's
not
all
he
said.
didn't
he
also
say,
if
he
were
to
take
your
position,
then
you
could
extend
forever,
and
we're
not
talking
about
just
a
little
filling
in.
we're
talking
about
enlarging
that
island
nine
times.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
whatever
that
may
have
provided
then,
what
article
second
clearly
does...
it
uses
the
word
present...
it
seems
to
preserve
the
status
quo,
what
was
at
the
time,
and
it's
silent
as
to
anything
else,
as
far
as
i
can
tell.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
the
overwhelming
presence
of
the
united
states
throughout
the
period
that
stops
new
jersey...
what
is
there
to
object
to?
the
governing
power
in
fact
is
the
united
states,
and
the
one
thing
that
is
clear
in
this
compact
is
that
congress
reserved...
the
hydra-headed
word,
jurisdiction,
the
united
states
jurisdiction.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
the
davis-bacon
is
mixed,
isn't
it?
there
was
some
indication
that
new
jersey
standards
were
used,
too.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
you
said,
now,
it's
pretty
clear.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
one
concludes
that
even
if
that's
so,
a
few
births
and
a
few
deaths
don't
make
ellis
island
filled-in
land,
under
the
sovereignty
of
one
state
or
the
other,
that's--
