justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
how
could
it
have
no
meaning?
that
is,
let's
assume
you're
right.
you're
right
that...
i'm
assuming...
that
this
is
within
the
sovereign...
your
sovereign...
new
jersey
has
sovereignty.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because
of
article
i.
still,
isn't
there
some
kind
of
jurisdiction
to
do
something--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--given
by
article
iii,
and
is...
you
want
an
injunction,
which
injunction
says
new
york
can
do
nothing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
how
can
it
be
that
they
could
do
nothing
when
article
iii
says
they
have
jurisdiction
over
the
land
below
the
water
and
the
water?
i
mean,
maybe
that
jurisdiction
doesn't
mean
sovereignty.
maybe
it
only
means
a
few
things,
like
just
serve
process
even,
but
doesn't
it
mean
something?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--in
other
words,
exclusive
jurisdiction
doesn't
mean
that.
it
means
that
the
only
thing
you
could
deal
with
is
a
ship,
so
that
it--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
suppose
there
is
a
ship,
a
ferry
boat
tied
up
at
the
pier
that
now
is
in
new
jersey's
sovereign
territory
next
to
that
immigration
house,
all
right.
doesn't
new
york
have
jurisdiction
over
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
fine.
if
new
york
has
jurisdiction
over
that,
on
your
theory,
how
can
you
receive
an
injunction,
which
is
what
you
requested,
saying
that
they
couldn't
enforce
their
law
at
all?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
sort
of
injunction...
this
is
what's
confusing
me.
the
injunction
that
you
requested
is
an
injunction
that
says
new
york
cannot
enforce
its
laws
or
assert
its
jurisdiction.
then
once
you
say
that
there
is
something
at
least
they
could
do,
even
if
it's
just
to
a
boat
that's
tied
up,
then
how
could
you
be
entitled
to
that
injunction?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
didn't
find
in
the
special
master's
report
a
discussion
of
what
exclusive
jurisdiction
meant.
i
understood
that
he
gives...
he
believes
that
new
jersey
is
sovereign,
and
i
accept
that,
so
what
are
we
to
do
to
decide
whether
exclusive
jurisdiction
means
you
can
do
zero,
new
york
can
still
do
zero
in
respect
to
the
submerged
land?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
related
to
the
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
was
the
submerged
land?
what
do
you
think
they
can
do,
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
lands
covered
by
said
waters?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
do
you
do
this
little...
maybe
it's
just
a
minor...
i
don't
know.
the
problem's
still
bothering
me.
in
the
first
three
paragraphs
of
the
complaint
for
relief,
new
jersey
wants
boundaries
drawn
in
a
certain
way,
and
you
basically
agree.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
assuming
that
right,
what
do
we
do
about
paragraph
4,
where
they
ask
for
an
injunction
that
no
new
york
law
at
all
can
be
enforced
on
the
filled
land?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
what
was
disturbing
me
because
of
the
concern
that
i
had
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
might
mean
something
in
respect
to
that
filled
land.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
what
are
we
supposed
to
do,
then,
about
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
we
should
not...
i
think
the
master,
but
i'm
not
certain,
recommended
that
we
accept
that
paragraph
4,
but
we
should
not,
in
your
opinion,
do
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
not
sure
about--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
lose
on
your
points,
those
hypothetical--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
lose
on
article
ii--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
suppose
i
were
to
think,
no,
article
ii
gives
sovereignty
to
new
jersey
over
the
fill.
well,
then
is
there
an
additional
point,
or
do
you
concede
then,
if
new
jersey
has
sovereignty
over
the
fill,
that
new
jersey
law
applies
over
the
fill?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
understand
that,
but
i'm
trying
to
work
out
a
phrase
in
the
injunction.
the
state
of
new
york
is
enjoined
from
enforcing
her
laws,
if
that's
the
recommended
injunction,
and
so
what
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
is
whether
you
have
made
some
argument...
i
didn't
see
it
in
your
brief...
whether
you
have
made
some
argument
below,
or
whether
you
have
conceded
the
point
that
if
you're
wrong
about
sovereignty,
and
new
jersey
is
sovereign
over
the
fill,
then
new
jersey
law
applies
to
the
fill,
not
new
york
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
is--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--thank
you.
what
about
the
provision
in
article
fifth
that
the
state
of
new
york
shall
have
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
and
over
the
waters,
docks,
and
improvements
made
and
to
be
made
on
the
shore
of
staten
island?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--are
we
supposed
to
go
back...
i
mean,
i
notice
the
special
master
says
that
new
york
was
unable
to
prove
that
the
births,
marriages
and
deaths
she
documented
occurred
on
the
island,
let
alone
the
landfilled
portions,
so
is
it
your
thought
that
we
would
go
back
and
read
all
the
evidence
on
that,
and
then
we
come
to
an
opposite
conclusion?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--don't
they
have
mayor
hague?
didn't
mayor
hague
at
some
point--
