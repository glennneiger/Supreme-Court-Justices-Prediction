justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
interrupt
you
with
just
one
question
that
puzzles
me.
we
can't
ignore
article
first,
either,
can
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
boundary
is
in
the
middle
of
the
river,
and
now
the
portion
of
the
river
between
the
middle
and
the
shore
of
new
jersey
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
new
york
under
article
third,
but
how
can
that
be...
how
can
you
say
there's
a
boundary
there
if
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
article
third
means
what
you
say
it
does?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
counsel,
just
the
language
of
article
second
itself
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
support
your
notion
that
whatever
happens
to
the
island...
it
says,
shall
retain
its
present
jurisdiction,
and
shall
also
retain.
it's
a
matter
of
retaining
what
now
exists--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--rather
than
acquiring
what
may
be
added
in
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
in
terms
of
the
language.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
only
article
second
that
really
supports
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
many
people
lived
on
ellis
island?
