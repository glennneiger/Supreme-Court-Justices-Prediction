mr.
daniel
smirlock
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
compact
of
1834
and
the
events
thereafter
show
that
all
of
ellis
island
is
in
new
york.
no
other
interpretation
of
that
compact
or
of
those
events
makes
sense.
i'll
redirect
the
court's
attention
to
article
ii
of
the
compact,
which
we
think
is
the
key
here,
and
to
which
very
little
attention
was
paid
in
the
arguments
of
the
united
states
and
new
jersey.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
the
appendix
to
our
main
brief,
our
brief
on
exceptions,
page
51...
52,
i
guess,
is
where...
51
is
where
article
second
appears.
article
ii
of
that
compact
says
that
ellis
island,
without
reservation,
is
in
the
state
of
new
york,
and
as
new
jersey
conceded
in
its
1829
complaint
in
this
court
during
the
negotiations
for
the
compact
and
again
conceded
in
this
action,
the
present
action--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--no,
but
the
parties
both
interpret
it
that
way
as
to,
there
is
no
dispute
that
the
grant
to
new
york
of
jurisdiction
over
ellis
island
was
in
the
nature
of
a
grant
of
sovereignty.
the
only
question
in
this
case
is
whether
that
grant
of
jurisdiction
extends
to
the
landfilled
portions
of
ellis
island
as
well
as
the
original
portion.
there
is
absolutely
no
dispute
between
the
parties
as
to
the
fact
that--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--jurisdiction
in
article
second
of
the
compact
means
sovereignty.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
i--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--correct,
your
honor.
the
compact
itself,
by
its
own
force
of
the
language
of
article
second,
and
new
jersey
concedes
this,
gave
new
york
rights
of
sovereignty
over
ellis
island
as
it
existed
in
1834.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
it
doesn't,
but
in
fact
that's
how
it's
been
interpreted,
and
that's...
and
there
is
no
disagreement
that
that
is
what
jurisdiction
in
that
article
means,
and
the
only
question
is
whether
that
jurisdiction
which
is
of
the
nature
of
sovereignty
is
sufficient
to
encompass
the
landfilled
portions
of
the
island
that
got
added
after
1834.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
i,
too,
find
it
very--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--yes,
and
the
reason
that
there's
a
distinction,
by
the
way,
between
the
retention
of
jurisdiction
as
to
bedloe's
and
ellis
island
and
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
without
qualification
over
the
other
islands
of
the
bay,
which
is
all
the
islands,
is
that
bedloe's
and
ellis
have
had
a
measure
of
jurisdiction
over
them
ceded
to
the
united
states,
and
the
special
master
made
that
clear.
we
go
a
long
way
with
the
special
master,
or
can
go
a
long
way.
we
don't
think
that
article
iii...
that
it
must
be
interpreted,
the
grant
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
must
be
interpreted
to
be
in
the
nature
of
sovereignty
for
us
to
prevail.
we
think
that
article
ii
does
that
of
its
own
force,
and
we
think
that's
because
the
compact
intended
with
respect
to
expansion
of
the
article
ii
islands
in
the
harbor,
what
the
compact
intended
is
clear
from
what
was
happening
in
the
harbor
at
the
time,
from
the
structure
and
purpose
of
the
compact.
what
was
happening
in
the
harbor
at
the
time
is
that
landfill
was
in
wide
use.
as
the
special
master
found,
and
the
parties
have
joined
issue
on
this
in
their
briefs,
ellis
island
actually
had
landfill
on
it
at
the
time
of
the
compact.
there
was
also
substantial
landfill
on
both--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--no,
you
can't,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
let
me
try
to
parse
the
first
three
articles
of
the
compact
for
you,
because
i
think
their
structure
proves
our
point.
article
i
of
the
compact
establishes
the
sovereign
boundary
between
the
states
as
the
midpoint
of
the
bay,
with,
as
it
makes
clear,
certain
exceptions.
the
first
of
those
exceptions
appears
in
article
ii,
which
gives
the
islands...
the
islands
which,
if
they
are
on
the
western
portion
of
the
bay
might
under
article
first
otherwise
have
fallen
to
new
jersey,
gives
those
islands
without
exception
to
new
york.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
would,
without
article
second,
but
as
it's
agreed,
article
second
gave
them
to
new
york.
article
third
deals
with
the
waters,
the
underwater
land,
and
the
new
jersey
shoreline.
it
gives
exclusive
jurisdiction
which,
we
argue,
is
in
the
nature
of
police
power,
over
navigation
and
commerce
in
the
harbor,
and
there's
compact
history
that
supports
this,
and
the
special
master
cites
it,
and
so
do
we
in
our
brief,
gives
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
both
the
lands
under
water,
which
we
would
argue
probably
refers
to
dumping,
refers
to
ships
on
the
ocean
floor,
and
probably
refers
to
landfill,
because
landfill
gets
put
on
subaqueous
land.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
probably.
that--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--that
sort
of
thing,
and
it
refers
both
to
underwater
land
and
to
the
waters
in
the
harbor.
now,
new
jersey
says
that
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
extinguished
as
soon
as
there
is
more
land,
there
was
new
land
put
in
the
harbor,
but
that
seems
most
improbable.
jurisdiction
over
navigation
and
commerce
obviously
entails
jurisdiction
over
both
the
waters
per
se
and
the
lands
in
those
waters,
used
as
anchorage,
used
for
docking,
used
as
storage
areas,
used
for
lighthouses,
and
that's--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--conceding
that
arguendo...
that's
article
iii...
we
still
have
to
deal,
we
think
dispositively,
with
article
ii,
because
this
case
isn't
about
article
iii,
really.
it's
about
article
ii's
grant
to
new
york
of
those
islands
without
reservation,
islands
that
already
had...
or
ellis
island
did...
already
had
landfill
on
it.
so
the
question
is,
and
really
the
only
question--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--the
pier
was
built
on
landfill,
yes.
it
was
about
a...
4/10ths
of
an
acre
of
landfill,
as
the
special
master
found,
and
what
was
going
on
in
the
harbor
at
the
time
of
the
compact
was
that
landfill
was
extensively
in
use
on
both
sides
of
the
harbor.
new
jersey,
and
jersey
city,
and
hoboken,
had
been
extensively
expanded
by
landfill,
750
acres
of
made
land,
as
it's
called,
on
manhattan
island
by
the
time
of
the
compact,
the
4/10ths
of
an
acre
that
i
mentioned
on
ellis
island
already.
moreover,
as
a...
as
the
1836
coastal
survey
map
that's
part
of
the
record
very
vividly
shows,
the
water
around
ellis
island
was
extremely
shallow.
it
was
a
foot
or
two
deep
around
ellis
island
at
the
most.
simply
to
get
out
to
3
feet
of
water,
which
is
the
minimum
necessary
for
a
barge
to
have
gotten
there
at
the
time
to
supply
the
fort,
they
had
to
build
that
pier,
which
is...
was
between
60
and
100
feet
out
into
the
bay.
so
the
use
of
landfill
not
only
was
foreseeable
on
ellis
island,
but
had
already
occurred,
so
it
certainly
was
something
that
the
compactors
had
in
their
mind,
and
it
is
referred
to
in
the
compact.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
he
did.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
i
disagree
with
it
because
he
said
the
evidence
of
landfill...
that
landfill
was
used...
well,
he
agreed,
frankly,
with
us
that
landfill
had
been
added
to
ellis
island.
he
agreed
with
it,
but
he
made
nothing
of
that.
he
disagreed
with
us...
he
said
the
evidence
that
landfill
had
been
extensively
used
in
the
harbor
was
ambiguous,
and
frankly,
your
honor,
it
is
overwhelming.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
well,
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
the
island
was
tiny,
and
it's
still
tiny.
it's
still
less,
even
with
the
filling,
than
<four
one
hundredths>
[=
4/100ths]
of
a
square
mile,
but
beyond
that,
we
think
the
compact
addresses
that.
there's
a
very
elaborate
system
of
checks
and
balances
in
it.
first
of
all,
just
as
a
practical
matter,
if
ellis
island,
or
any
island
in
the
bay,
gets
extended
too
far
in
the
direction
of
new
jersey,
it's
new
jersey,
and
that's
in
the
western
direction.
if
it
gets
extended
to
the
east,
true,
it
was
very
shallow
around
ellis
island,
but
very
soon
there
was
a
sharp
drop-off
off
the
jersey
flats,
which
is
what
ellis
island
is
on,
into
the
main
ship
channel,
which
was
20
feet
deep,
and
which
would
have
been
very,
very
hard
to
fill.
moreover,
there
was,
as
i
say,
a
system
of
checks
and
balances.
on
the
one
hand,
if
new
york
had
wanted
to
fill
any
of
those
islands
they
would
have
had
to
buy
the
subaqueous
land
from
new
jersey,
which
had,
under
article
iii,
an
exclusive
right
of
property
in
that
subaqueous
land,
and
that's
what
we
think
it
means.
we
think
property
means
exactly
what--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--because
they're
islands.
new
york
was
given
the
islands,
and
we
think
once
they
stop
being
islands,
they
stop
having
article
ii,
article
second
apply
to
them.
if
somehow
or
other
they
became
annexed
to
the
new
jersey
shore,
we
don't
think
that
they
would--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--very
much
so,
and
that's
why
we
still
think
it's
new
york.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
yes.
if
it...
if
somehow
or
other--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--well,
wait
a
second.
i
mean,
one
check
and
balance,
as
i
say,
is
that
to
fill
anything
we
would
have
had
to
obtain
the
right
to
fill
on
the
subaqueous
land
that
belonged
to--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--well,
that's
true,
but
that
was
a
check
that
new
jersey
could
apply.
no,
we're
not
going
to
sell
you
this
land
to
fill
on
it.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
frankly,
i
don't
see
how
new
york
could
condemn
it.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
because
the
subaqueous
land,
insofar
as
it
was
subaqueous--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--no,
no,
no.
under
article
third
it
had
a
property
right.
we
concur
that
under
the
first
article,
the
article
that
establishes
the
boundary...
as
i
thought
i
indicated,
that
territory
was
sovereign
territory
of
new
jersey,
so
new
york...
it
was
not
in
new
york.
insofar
as
it
was
ellis
island,
or
any
island,
bedloe's
island,
any
of
the
other
islands
in
the
bay,
those
were
new
york,
when
it
became
above
water
and
part
of
those
islands.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
well,
the
meaning
isn't
so
strange.
you're
interpreting,
of
course,
a
compact,
which
is
both
a
contract--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--and
a
statute.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
and
this
compact
gives
ellis
island,
including
the
landfill,
as
i'll
explain,
to
new
york.
not
only
was
landfill
in
wide
use,
so
the
commissioners
would
have
known
about
it--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--well,
here's
the
question,
your
honor.
could
the
compactors
actually,
knowing
that
landfill
would
probably
be
added
to
those
islands,
could
they
really
have
imagined
that
as
soon
as
5
feet
were
added
to
that
pier,
5
feet
of
landfill
added
to
ellis
island--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--i
think
it
preserves
the
status
quo
as
to
the
scope
of
new
york's
jurisdiction.
that
is,
bedloe's
and
ellis,
as
to
which
the
phrase
present
jurisdiction
is
used,
had
already
had
a
measure
of
jurisdiction
ceded
to
the
united
states.
i
don't
think
it
can
be
taken
as
a
spatial
limitation,
and
the
special
master
agreed
with
that,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
avulsion
doesn't
apply
here.
the
common
law
avulsion
rule,
as
this
court
has
recognized
in
shapleigh
v.
mier,
applies
only
when
the...
it's
a
default
rule.
it
applies
only
when
the
compact
doesn't
address--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--well,
no,
not--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
i'm
not
saying
it's
presumed
to
be
accretion.
i'm
not
saying
anything
about
avulsion.
i'm
saying
that
the
compact
deals
with
ellis
island.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
you
would,
except
that
i
am
saying
that
it
is
a
compact
that
does
specify,
that
the
grant
of
ellis
island
in
its
entirety
and
without
exception
to
new
york,
coupled
with
the
foreseeable
use
of
landfill
and
the
great--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--well,
i
am,
but
of
course
this
court
has
independent
de
novo
review--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--of
that
very
thing--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--you
very
rarely
reinvent
the
wheel,
because
generally
special
masters
get
the
wheel
right,
but
when
the
wheel's
badly
designed,
i
think
you've
got
to
go
back
and
redesign
it,
and--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--mm-hmm.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
well--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--let's
look
at
the
rest
of
the
compact,
because
i
think
it
supports
our--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--no.
article
third
does
as
well,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
article
third
mentions
the
fact
that
new
jersey
will
have
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
improvements
on
its
own
shore,
and
improvements,
it's
agreed
by
new
jersey,
encompasses
landfill.
now,
there
are
two
possible
ways
to
read
that.
the
com...
the
commissioners
either
somehow
or
other
envisioned
that
there
would
be
improvements
only
to
the
new
jersey
shore,
and
to
the
staten
island
shore,
which
is
dealt
with
similarly
in
article
v,
and
not
to
islands
where
landfill
had
already
been
added,
or
for
some
reason
or
other
they
didn't...
they
envisioned
it,
but
didn't
have
to
deal
with
it
in
the
compact,
and
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
the
latter.
the
improvements
mentioned
on
the
jersey
shore
over
which
new
jersey
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
would
have
abutted
overwater
and
underwater
land
over
which
new
york
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
and
that
might
otherwise
have
given
new
york
over
the...
authority
over
the
landfill
placed
on
the
new
jersey
shore.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
yes,
and
the
grant
of
jurisdiction
over
those
improvements
to
new
jersey
assured
that
they
could
wharf
out
and
make
land
on
their
own
shores.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
mm-hmm.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
mm-hmm.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
i
don't,
your
honor.
i
don't...
i
mean,
i
don't
concede
that
new
jersey
has
sovereignty
over
the
fill
because--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--i
believe
the
point
is
conceded,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
new
jersey
law
applies,
yes.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
exact...
it's
the
inverse
of
the
article
third
provision
i
was
talking
about
a
moment
ago.
again,
you
had
staten
island,
over
which
new
york
had
jurisdiction,
sovereignty--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--and
abutting
staten
island
you
had
waters
over
which
new
jersey--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--right,
and
that's...
no,
not
just
like
ellis
island.
new
york
had
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
those
waters
and
the
underwater
land
surrounding
ellis
island.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
no.
if
you
look
at
the
compact,
new
jersey
was
given
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
those
waters,
and--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--not
in
that
small
territory,
and
that's
why
the
compacting
parties
had
to
sort
out--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--who
had
authority
over
those
improvements,
so
when
you
see
that
in
the
compact
you
have
to
say
either,
they
envisioned
landfill
on
staten
island
in
new
jersey
but
not
on
islands
where
it
had
already
been
put,
which
seems
to
us
most
improbable,
or,
they
simply
didn't
feel
they
had
to
deal
with
it
because
there
was
no
potential
conflict
between
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
article
third
or
fifth
and
new
york
sovereignty
over
the
islands
under
article
second.
if
you
think
that
new
jersey's
right,
you
must
think...
you
must
think
that
the
commissioners
who
made
the
compact
actually
thought
that
when
that
5
feet
of
landfill
got
added
to
the
pier,
that
would
be
in
new
jersey,
that
they
agreed
to
balkanize
the
islands,
notwithstanding
having
given
them
without
exception
or
qualification
under
article
second
to
new
york,
and
that
is
a
very
improbable
conclusion.
now,
i
will
turn
now
to
our
argument
that,
notwithstanding
the
compact,
new
york
prevails
in
this
case
by
virtue
of
the
doctrine
of
prescription
and
acquiescence.
i'll
recite
some
of
the
prescriptive
acts
in
which
new
york
engaged
over
ellis
island.
ellis
island
was
in
united
states
new
york
congressional
districts,
in
new
york
assembly
and
senate
districts.
the
united
states
in
the
new
york
censuses
enumerated
ellis
island
in
new
york.
ellis
island
residents,
who
lived
only
on
the
landfill
portion
of
the
island,
voted
in
new
york.
the
ins,
which
occupied
the
island
throughout
the
immigration
period
from
1890
to
1954,
thought,
without
exception,
that
it
was
in
new
york.
other
federal
agencies
doing
business
on
or
with
ellis
island,
including
on
the
fill,
thought
that
it
was
in
new
york.
congress,
in
its
legislation
and
in
its
committee
hearings,
described
it
repeatedly
as
ellis
island,
new
york,
referring
often
to
the
fill.
the
federal
courts
of
new
york
took
jurisdiction
over
ellis
island.
the
federal
courts
of
new
jersey
not
only
didn't
take
jurisdiction,
they
rejected
it.
they
refused
it
when
it
was
proffered.
the
new
york
worker's
compensation
law
applied
both
before
and
after
the
buck
act
was
passed.
new
york
city
wage
rates
applied
to
labor
on
ellis
island
both
before
and
after
the
davis-bacon
act.
the
individuals
who
lived
and
worked
on
the
island
thought,
as
far
as
we
have
their
evidence,
that
it
was
in
new
york.
when
people
were
born
on
ellis
island,
in
the
hospitals
that
were
on
landfill,
they
were
born
in
new
york.
when
they
died
in
those
hospitals,
they
died
in
new
york.
when
they
married
in...
on
ellis
island,
they
married
in
new
york.
none
of
those
things
can
be
said
of
new
jersey,
and
against
those
things
the
weight
of
new
jersey's
counterexamples
of
nonacquiescence
simply
isn't
sufficient.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
they
were...
well,
i
think
those
are
two
different
questions.
the
acts
were
certainly
public.
we're
talking
about
things
that
were
done
by
the
federal
government
and
by
the
new
york
legislature,
so
they
knew
about
them.
to
what
extent
did
it
make
any
difference
in...
i'm
not
quite
sure
what
you're
asking,
your
honor.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
if
they
think
they're
sovereign
over
the
land,
but
it's
not...
i'm
not
saying
that
they--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--well,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
ellis
island,
erroneously
for
new
jersey,
was
on
both
tax
rolls
of
the
state,
and
in
fact,
although
the
tax
records
are
so
old
that
we
don't
have
them,
in
fact,
at
least
as
of
1940,
income
tax
earned
by
people
who
worked
on
the
island
would
have
been
taxable
by
a
state.
it
wasn't
a
completely
abstract
matter,
and
it
would
have
been
a
question
as
to
which
state
was
entitled
to
tax.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
well,
some
are
obscure,
but
some
are
as...
open
and
notorious,
you
might
say.
let's
take--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--it's
not
a
laches
argument
in
disguise,
it's--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--no,
it's
not
a
laches
argument
in
disguise.
i
think
that's
the
separate
laches
argument.
i'm
not
arguing
at
this
moment
that
new
jersey
should
have...
should
have
filed
suit,
though
i
will
later
on.
but
no,
all
i'm
arguing
is
that
the
acts
of
new
york
that
i
described,
especially
the
legislative
acts,
and
the
censuses,
certainly
were
public
acts
as
to
which
new
jersey
was
on
notice.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
as
to
that,
your
honor,
as
this
court
has
often
made
clear,
even
when
the
united
states
has
plenary
jurisdiction,
enclave
jurisdiction
over
particular
territory
within
a
state,
there's
a
good
deal
of
residual
jurisdiction
that
can
be
exercised
by
that
state.
as
the
court's
pointed
out,
territory
doesn't
stop
being
part
of
a
state
just
because
the
united
states
takes
it
under
the
enclave
clause.
the
municipal
laws
of
a
state,
to
use
the
term
that
this
court
has
used,
laws
designed
to
preserve
the
good
order
of
society,
remain
in
effect.
federal
law
doesn't
supplant
them.
and
then
there
are
all
the
areas
where,
by
statute,
state
law
applies.
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
the
davis-bacon
act
that
i
mentioned
before,
the
buck
act,
in
all
those
areas,
state
law
would
still
apply,
so
there
was
plenty
of
play
for
new
york
jurisdiction,
and
our
point
is
that
to
the
extent
there
was
state
jurisdiction
to
be
exercised,
and
there
was
plenty
of
room
for
it,
it
was
always
new
york
that
exercised
it.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
it
depends
upon
what
you
mean
by
mixed,
your
honor.
up
until
1947,
new
york
standards
were
used
exclusively.
in
1947,
as
new
jersey's
expert
explained
at
trial,
because
the
federal
government
wanted
to
save
some
money,
and
new
jersey
rates
were
lower,
there
was
a
brief
interregnum
of
about
2
years
when
new
jersey
rates
were
applied,
erroneously,
because
they
were
also
applied
on
the
main
island,
the
original
island
as
well.
and
then
in
1949,
and
this
is
a
repeated
pattern
with
new
jersey's
supposed
acts
of
nonacquiescence,
the
federal
government
recognized
its
error,
just
as
it
had
many
other
times
before,
and
said,
oh,
we
made
a
mistake,
back
to
new
york
rates,
and
they
started
applying
them
again.
it's
hard
to
call
that
mixed.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
possibly
with
the
davis-bacon
stuff
it
is,
but
with
much
of
the...
i
recited
already
the
examples
of
new
york's
prescription.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
between
100
and
200
over
the
years.
there's
one
anomalous...
at
least
while
ellis
island
was
a
going
concern
as
an
immigration
station,
between
100
and
200,
all
of
them
on
landfill,
and
they
all
voted
in
new...
well,
they
may
not
all
have
voted,
but
they
could
all
have
voted
in
new
york.
the
examples
of
acquiescence,
or
nonacquiescence
that
new
jersey
offers
simply
don't
measure
up.
there's
the
1904
deed
that
i'll
deal
with
first,
because
that's
their
exhibit
a,
and
what's
fascinating
about
that
deed
is
that
at
no
point,
even
though
in
1904
ellis
island
had
12
acres
of
landfill
on
it,
at
no
point
did
the
united
states
or
new
jersey
say,
oh,
and
by
the
way,
that
12
acres
must
be
in
new
jersey.
the
negotiations
between
those
two
parties
always
dealt
with
the
subaqueous
land,
and
we
think
that
supports
our
view
of
the
compact,
which
is,
if
it
was
underwater
land,
it
was
in
new
jersey,
but
if
it
became
abovewater
land
by
virtue
of
fill,
it
was
ellis
island,
and
because
under
article
ii
of
the
compact
ellis
island
goes
to
new
york--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--well,
it
was
valuable
land,
your
honor.
they
still
had...
for
one
thing,
they
still
had
the
right
of
property
in
it.
for
another
thing--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--as...
to
wharf
out
on,
extremely
valuable.
that
was
one
of
the
reasons...
and
this
is
all
in
the
record...
that
the
federal
harbor
line
board
took
over
the
establishment
of
harbor
lines
in
the
bay
was
because
the
states
were
building
out
landfill
from
both
sides,
and
they
had
to
have
some
kind
of
plenary
control
over
navigation.
that
was
very
valuable
land,
your
honor.
it
was
not
a
pittance.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
right.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
very
well,
your
honor.
it's
an
easily
convertible
argument,
and
in
fact
in
massachusetts
v.
new
york,
among
other
cases,
that's
exactly
what
this
court
did.
it
looked
as
if
it
was
analyzing
the
case
in
terms
of
prescription
and
acquiescence,
and
then
at
the
last
minute
in
its
opinion
it
said,
well,
we
think
this
shows
what
the
compact
meant,
and
i
agree
with
you,
it
does
show
what
the
compact
meant.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
if
you
read
even
any
of
the
evidence
you'll
come
to
an
opposite
conclusion,
your
honor.
i
think
that
was
the
single
biggest
error
that
the
special
master
made.
the
evidence
is
all
that
those...
the
marriages,
it's
ambiguous.
the
evidence
as
to
births
and
deaths,
they
occurred,
it
is
pretty
clear,
in
the
hospital,
and
the
hospital
was
on
island
number
2,
and
island
number
2
was
fill.
he
is
simply
mistaken,
and
i
ask
you
in
your--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--it
is
entirely
clear.
forgive
me.
it
was
rhetoric.
it
is
entirely
clear
that
that's
where
those
births
and
deaths
occurred
because
that's
where
the
certificates
say
they
occurred.
the
death
certificates
say,
ellis
island
hospital,
marine
hospital,
ellis
island,
and
that
hospital
was
on
fill.
it's
undisputed.
as
i
say,
i
believe
that
to
be
the
single
most
patent
error
in
the
special
master's
report.
now,
i
want
to
return
in
the
moment
i
have
left--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--if
that
were
all
we
have,
maybe
not,
but
there
is
this
pattern
of
everything
that
happened
on
ellis
island
that
was
subject
to
any
state's
jurisdiction
or
any
sort
of
action
by
any
state
was
always
taken
control
of
by
new
york.
if
all
we
had
were
a
few
birth
certificates,
that
would
be
problematic,
but
we
have
so
much
more,
in
addition
to
those
birth
certificates,
and
new
jersey,
and
this
is
an
important
point,
has
none
of
those
things.
mr.
daniel
smirlock
ah,
yes,
the
mary
norton
episode.
they
have
mayor
hague
coming
in,
and
mary
norton
was
his
cat's
paw,
and--
mr.
daniel
smirlock
--and
mayor
hague
came
in
and
said,
i
don't
know
anything
about
a
compact,
but
new...
ellis
island,
new
jersey
workers
want
ellis
island,
so
give
us
jobs,
and
even
then
they
couldn't
get
away
with
it,
your
honor.
the
united
states
had
to
agree
with
the
second
circuit
in
collins,
and
say
that
article
ii
awarded
the
entire
island.
