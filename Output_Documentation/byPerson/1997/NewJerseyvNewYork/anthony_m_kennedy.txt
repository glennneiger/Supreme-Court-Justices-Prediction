justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
only
observation
about
that,
and
it
helps
your
case,
i
think,
i
was
a
little
puzzled
that
the
special
master
did
not
pay
more
of
a...
put
more
weight
on
the
holmes'
opinion
in
central--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
special
master
didn't
seem
to
think...
it
seems
to
me
it...
on
the
sovereignty
issue
that
if
new
york
is
right
we
have
to
overrule
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
would
have
to
overrule
it
were
new
york
to
have
sovereignty,
would
we
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
jurisdiction
that
remains,
holmes'
opinion
is
not
quite
clear,
and
i
think
that
probably
needs
further
elaboration.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
or
whether
there
is
a
difference
in
article
iii
jurisdiction
or
article
ii
jurisdiction
is
not
clear
from
central
railroad.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
master
touched
that
in
part
at
page
67,
when
he
said
interpreting
exclusive
jurisdiction
in
article
third
to
mean
police
or
legal
jurisdiction
as
the
only
reading
of
article
iii
that
prevents
such
serious
anomalies,
but
he...
and
he...
but
he
addressed
it
no
further
than
that.
is
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
point
on
jurisdiction.
is
it
your
point
that
article
iii
exclusive
jurisdiction
is
of
somewhat
lower
order
than
the
word
present
jurisdiction
in
article
ii?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
if
so
that's
a
strange
use
of
words,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out.
exclusive
jurisdiction
seems
to
me
broader.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
jurisdiction
of
the
united
states
limited
to
certain
purposes?
could
the
united
states
build
an
office
building
and
rent
it
out
to
private
developers
if
the
united
states
wanted
to?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
when
you
say
exclusive,
do
you
mean
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
defined
in
article
iii
of
the
compact,
or
some
other
meaning
of
exclusive
jurisdiction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
other
words,
new
jersey
did
not
concede
that
prescriptive
rights
had
given
new
york
that
added
jurisdiction.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
prescriptive
rights
played
no
part
in
new
york's
jurisdiction
over
the
original
island.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
do
you
say
that
if
the
island
is
extended
too
far
toward
new
jersey
it's
new
jersey's?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
you...
so
far
as
ellis
island,
it's
still
an
island
until
it
touches
the
new
jersey
shore.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
you
saying
that
those
acts
put
new
jersey
on
notice
that
it
should
have
filed
its
suit
earlier?
but
if
you
say
that,
then
is
that
just
a
laches
argument
in
disguise?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
is
it
still
prescription?
