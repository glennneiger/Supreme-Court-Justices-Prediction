mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
master
correctly
rejected
new
york's
contention
that
article
second
of
the
compact
of
1834
gives
new
york
sovereignty
over
the
filled
areas
of
ellis
island.
the
compact
was
written
against
a
back-drop
of
common
law
rules
respecting
coastal
boundaries,
and
those
rules
recognized
that
avulsive
changes
such
as
the
addition
of
fill
did
not
change
the
location
of
the
boundary.
the
compact
does
not
address
fill,
and
it
does
not
purport
to
alter
the
common
law
rules.
as
a
result,
the
compact
should
be
interpreted
as
following
the
common
law
and
therefore
granting
and
preserving
new
jersey's
sovereignty
over
the
filled
areas.
now,
the
master
was
also
correct
in
rejecting
new
york's
contention
that
the
filled
portions
of
ellis
island
became
territory
of
new
york
through
the
doctrine
of
prescription
and
acquiescence,
and
we
think
the
single
most
important
consideration
on
this
score
is
the
fact
that
the
united
states
exercised
dominant
and
virtually
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
island
during
the
relevant
time
period.
now,
the
united
states
presence
is
important
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
united
states
recognized
new
jersey's
claim
to
the
filled
lands
by
purchasing
that
area
from
new
jersey
and
by
indicating
in
subsequent
maps
that
it
was
situated
in
new
jersey.
second,
the
united
states'
dominant
sovereign
presence
prevented
new
york
from
taking
those
acts
of
sovereignty
that
would
have
established
its
claim
of
entitlement
to
the
filled
areas,
and
likewise
would
have
put
new
jersey
on
notice
of
the
fact
that
new
york
was
making
such
a
claim.
now,
new
york
also
makes
a
claim
that
new
jersey
is
guilty
of
laches
in
this
case,
but
that
really
adds
nothing
to
new
york's
claim
in
this
case
at
all.
as
this
court
indicated
in
illinois
v.
kentucky,
the
equitable
defense
of
laches
is
subsumed
within
the
doctrine
of
prescription
and
acquiescence,
so
nothing
is
added
by
making
those
types
of
charges
here.
now,
although
we
agree
with
the
master's
determination
of
the
historic
boundary
on
ellis
island,
we
disagree
with
his
ultimate
remedy,
which
would
reconfigure
the
boundary
based
on
considerations
of
practicality
and
convenience.
we
think
it's
important
to
note
at
the
outset
that
new
jersey
asked
this
court
to
determine
the
historic
boundary
line.
it
did
not
request
that
the
court
withdraw
the
boundary.
neither
did
new
york
make
such
a
request,
as
well.
but
equally
important,
the
master's
proposal
would
require
this
court
to
exceed
its
historic
role
in
determining--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--if
they
had,
then
i
think
you'd
be
faced
squarely
with
the
question
of
whether
you
have
that
power
or
not,
and
we
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--you
do
not.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
no,
that's
not,
but
they
have
not
even
asked
in
this
case.
[laughter]
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
that
might
be
the...
that
might
be
the
case,
but
we
think
that
ultimately
the
court
lacks
the
power
to
draw
that
boundary
in
any
event--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--ultimately
it
does
not,
but
we
do
think
it's
significant
that
neither
party
asked
for
it,
and
this
court
does
not
often
grant
relief
that
neither
party
requested.
now,
in
the
past
this
court
has
decided
boundary
disputes
based
solely
on
its
interpretation
and
application
of
relevant
law,
and
the
court
explicitly
recognized
that
limitation
in
washington
v.
oregon,
where
washington
had
asked
this
court
to
change
a
boundary
based
on
changed
circumstances,
and
this
court
refused
to
do
so.
it
refused
to
do
so
even
though
the
adjustment
would
implement
an
underlying
policy
that
congress
might
have
preferred.
as
that
case
indicates,
once
this
court
determines
the
location
of
a
boundary,
its
judicial
role
is
at
an
end.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct,
but
in
this
case
what
we're
saying
is
the
historic
boundary
should
be
fixed
by
the
original
contours
of
the
island,
because
that's
what
congress
and
the
parties
intended
by
virtue
of
the
compact
of
1834.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
might
be,
but
we
think
ultimately
the
general
principle
at
stake
in
washington
v.
oregon
does
control
here,
which
is
that
this
court
should
respect
the
power
of
the
political
branches
to
determine
boundaries
and
draw
those
boundaries
and,
in
fact,
the
constitution
provides
for
adjustments
of
boundaries
if
need
be.
there
is
a
compact
clause
of
the
constitution
that
does
allow
the
states
to
agree,
with
congress'
consent,
to
the
alteration
of
the
boundary,
and
that's
in
fact
what
actually
happened
in
washington
v.
oregon.
that
is
how
that
dispute
was
ultimately
settled,
was
by
virtue
of
a
compact
between
the
two
states
to
alter
the
boundary.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
i
think--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--i
think
that
takes
us
back
to
the
suggestion
that
the
united
states
made
at
the
point
when
the
complaint
was
first
filed
in
this
case
and
the
court
asked
for
our
views
on
this
matter,
and
at
that
point
we
explained
that
there
might
be
a
number
of
issues
that
can
only
be
resolved
in
a
specific
factual
context,
and
so
those
issues
are
simply
not
ripe
at
this
point.
we
think
that--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
think
all
the
court
can
do
at
this
point,
all
the
court
should
do
at
this
point
is
draw
the...
describe
where
the
historic
boundary
is,
and
just
simply
indicate
that
any
other
dispute
that
might
arise
can
be
handled
by
the
parties
seeking
further
relief,
as
the
court
has
decreed.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
as
a--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--my
recollection
might
be...
might
not
be
completely
accurate,
but
i'm
not
sure
the
master
specifically
addressed
that
question,
but
he...
his
proposed
decree
does
leave
it
open
to
the
parties
to
seek
further
relief
at
the
foot
of
the
decree,
which
is
common
in
the
case
of
original
actions
and
original
decrees.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
that
is
correct,
and
that's...
this
case
is
unusual
insofar
as
the
united
states
owns
title
to
all
of
the
land
in
question
here.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
well,
it's
likely
that
the
issue
could
arise
between
a
state
and
a
private
party.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
but
ultimately
the
issue
would
ultimately
return
to
this
court,
and
the
court
would
make
a
resolution
of
law
in
that
context.
whether
there
would
be
a
direct
clash
between
two
states
over
a
particular
power
of
regulation
is
perhaps
less
likely.
it
would
actually
require
some
situation
where
both
states
purport
to
have
the
power
to
regulate
over
a
particular
area,
and
i
think
that's
unlikely
to
occur
in
this
area
simply
because
the
united
states
does
have
title
and
continues
to
exercise
dominant
control.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
oh,
there
are
some
modest
consequences
with
regard
to
certain
activity,
such
as
the
collection
of
tax
revenues
and
the
like.
even
if
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
island,
which
is
not
something
that
we're
asserting,
but
even
if
it
did,
under
the
buck
act
the
states
can
still
collect
certain
types
of
taxes
from
activities
that
take
place
on
the
land.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
sales
taxes
from
concessions
on
the
island
would
be
one
example.
both
states
would
have
no
doubt
claimed
some
interest
in
the
renovation
of
the
southern
portion
of
the
island
here,
but
ultimately
we
think
that
congress
will
make
those
determinations,
taking
into
account
the
concerns
and
considerations
of
both
states.
much
of
what's
at
stake
here,
and
i
think
we
indicated
this
at
the
time
that
we
filed
our
initial
amicus
brief
in
response
to
the
complaint,
is
a
concern
over
a
notion
of
the
sovereign
boundary
as
it
relates
to
the
history
of
the
two
states,
and
the
court
has
allowed
this
action
to
proceed,
and
we
do
think
that's
a
significant
question,
but
its
practical
implications
are
likely
to
be
limited
by--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--well,
our
perspective
on
the
jurisdiction
on
the
island
is
as
follows.
the
united
states
has
exclusive
jurisdiction
over
the
original
3
acres
of
the
island
that
was
granted
by
new
york
in
1800
as
to...
with
respect
to--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--no.
we
mean
the
more
conventional
description
of--
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
--we
actually
are
referring
to
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
as
it's
described
in
the
interdepartmental
study
on
legislative
jurisdiction
in
1957,
which
deals
with
this
issue
quite
comprehensively.
but
as
with
respect
to
the
filled
lands
the
united
states
has
concurrent
jurisdiction
over
those
areas.
thank
you.
