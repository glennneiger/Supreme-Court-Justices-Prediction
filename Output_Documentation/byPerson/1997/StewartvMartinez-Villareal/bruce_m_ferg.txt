mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
has
been
said
that
the
principles
which
guide
this
court's
habeas
corpus
jurisprudence
are
finality,
federalism,
and
fairness.
in
1996,
congress
conducted
its
own
assessment
of
those
principles
and
recalibrated
the
instrument
of
statutory
habeas
corpus
in
the
antiterrorism
and
effective
death
penalty
act,
so
now
there
is
a
fourth
principle
which
might
be
called
fidelity
which
must
be
applied
here,
by
which
i
mean
that
this
court,
as
the
supervisor
of
the
lower
federal
court
system,
must
ensure
that
the
lower
courts
are
faithfully
applying
the
plain
meaning
and
clear
intent
of
that
act.
it
is
critical
to
read
this
statute
on
its
own
terms,
because
we
sometimes
find
that
we
have
in
effect
new
wine
in
old
bottles,
the
same
concepts
but
with
new
meaning
and,
therefore,
we
have
to
read
the
statute
very,
very
carefully
to
understand
what
exactly
it
is
that
congress
was
doing.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
yes,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
as
i
pointed
out,
the
way
2244
has
been
modified
simply
expunges
the
concept
of
abuse
of
the
writ,
so
that
we
now
have
in
effect
some
very
clear
designations
of
what
is
a
successive
petition
and
this
kind
of
amorphous
concept--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
yes
and
no.
the
lower
courts
did
not
address
that,
but
this
court
in
woodard
v.
hutchins
did
deal
with
a
contention
that
the
individual
was
currently
insane
as
he
was
approaching
execution.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
and
it
was
indicated
by
five
justices
here
that
that
was,
in
fact,
a
contention
that
was
subject
to
abuse
of
the
writ
analysis,
and
so
even
before
aedpa
there
had
been
the
indication
that
in
fact
that
kind
of
a
claim
might
well
be--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--it
may
well
be.
the
reason
for
that--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
because
of
the
plain
language
of
that
second
exception--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--which
says
that
if
it
is
a
matter
which
you
could
not
have
brought
the
facts
forward
before,
nonetheless,
if
it
does
not
go
to
guilt-innocence
determinations,
then
it's
excluded.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
we
have
to
distinguish
your
hypothetical
as
one
where
the
entire
petition
was
dismissed.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
and
our
position
is
in
that
situation
it
is
in
effect
not
an
application
which
is
meaningful.
however,
this
case
was
a
situation
where
there
was
a
first
petition,
where
30
claims
were
adjudicated
on
the
merits
or
preclusion
basis
to
the
end,
and
therefore
what
we're
suggesting
is
that
although
2254
has
also
been
modified,
particularly
so
that
it
is
no
longer
necessary
as
under
rose
to
mandatorily
dismiss,
but
the
effect
for
a
case
where
there
has
been
an
application
where
there
has
been
progress
to
an
adjudication
of
some
of
those
claims
on
the
merits--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--it
was,
and
found
not
ripe.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
that
was
the
anticipation,
yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
question
was
raised
in
the
ninth
circuit
and
they
agreed
that
that
particular
claim
was
properly
dismissed
as
being
premature,
because
there
was
no
warrant
for
execution.
it
was
years
before
the
likelihood
of
an
execution
actually
taking
place.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
under
pre-aedpa
he
did
what
he
could,
and
i
want
to
emphasize
that
this
is
not
a
situation
where
the
state
somehow
inveigled
him,
or
mouse-trapped
him.
we
certainly
didn't
know
3
years
in
advance
that
aedpa
was
going
to
be
passed.
the
law
was
changed
as
this
case
progressed,
and
so
in
effect
congress
said
this
no
longer
is
the
kind
of
claim
which
ought
to
be
heard
in
federal
district
courts,
much
like
they
came
back
in
1868
and
said,
we
are
going
to
withdraw
habeas
appellate
jurisdiction
from
this
court,
and
no
more
than
mr.
mccardle
had
a
justiciable
interest
after
that,
so
mr.
martinez
villareal
no
longer
has
an
interest
that
can
be
presented
at
least
in
district--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--right.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
if
it
were
exclusively
the
ford
claim
and
it
had
been
dismissed
at
that
point,
then
we
would
not
consider
that
a
successive
application,
because
there
had
been
no
determination
on
any
merits
issue.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
because
we
are
giving
meaning
to
every
word
in
the
statute,
including
application.
what
does
it
mean
to
have
a
meaningful
application?
it's
got
to
be
something
that
the
courts
can
rule
on.
for
example,
there
are
cases
out
of
the
seventh
circuit
which
say,
if
this
petition
is
dismissed
for
lack
of
a
filing
fee,
or
failure
to
submit
the
proper
affidavits
and
so
forth,
then
we're
not
going
to
treat
it
as
successive
and
that's
appropriate,
because
in
effect
the
court
is
saying,
this
is
a
nothing.
we're
not
going
to
do
anything
with
it.
but
in
this
case,
we
had
years
of
litigation,
evidentiary
hearings,
and
determination
of
30
issues.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--well,
sometimes
there
is
much
ado
about
nothing.
[laughter]
in
this
particular
situation,
though,
all
that
the
state
did
was
point
out
what
the
district
court
probably
would
have
noticed
on
its
own,
which
is
that
if
you
do
not
have
a
ripe
issue
you
do
not
have
article
iii
justiciability.
you've
got
to
have
a
cause
that
the
court
can
deal
with
and
if
there
simply
isn't,
at
that
point,
a
meaningful
possibility
that
you
are
going
to
be
executed,
you
don't
have
something
that
you
can
present
at
that--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--no,
ma'am,
i
don't
believe
it
can,
because--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--congress,
which,
of
course,
is
the
author
of
both
of
these
remedial
schemes,
if
you
will,
has,
i
think,
made
it
clear
that
everything
to
do
with
capital
punishment
and
capital
sentences
is
to
be
litigated
by
way
of
habeas.
for
example,
in
21
u.s.c.
848(q),
where
they
talk
about
the
funding
statute
and
it
says,
this
is
the
way
that
you
do
it,
you
fund
lawyers
to
bring
sections
under
2254
and
2255
for
all
kinds
of
things,
including
competency
determinations.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
what
this
court
indicated
in
gomez
v.
u.s.
district
court
is
that
section
1983
is
not
a
device
to
circumvent
rules
against
successive
petitions.
in
that
case
it
was
a
mccleskey
type
of
situation,
but
because
1983--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--well,
to
the
extent
that
congress
has
indicated
this
is
the
way
it
should
go,
particularly
by
the
addition
of
chapter
154--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
in
effect
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
has
determined
this
question
already.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
the
application
is
successive
because
it
is
the
second
time
he
has
come
to
the
court.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
it
is
successive
because
it
goes
ultimately
to
that
very
same
sentence
that
was
imposed
upon
him
in
the
first
place,
and
therefore
he
is
coming
a
second
time
to
in
effect
get
a
federal
court
to
say,
you
cannot
execute
this
person.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
okay,
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
my
reading
of
the
legislative
history
does
not
show
that
they
specifically
looked
at
the
narrow
issue
of
competency
for
execution,
but
what
they
did
do
is,
in
drafting
their
exceptions,
made
it
very
clear
that
it
was
not
to
do
with
any
issue
of
sentencing
but
only
of
built-innocence,
and
as
far
as
the
torture,
breaking
on
the
wheel,
that
is
what
direct
search
is
for.
you're
always--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--exactly.
that
says--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--that's
essentially
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at,
that
this
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
if
it
is
something
which
relates
to
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence,
yes,
then
that
would
be
permissible,
assuming
that,
again,
there
were
some
newly
discovered
facts.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
okay.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
not
be
capricious
at
all,
because
in
effect
what
we're
finding
here
is
that
t
he
individual
is
going
to
have
virtually
the
same
kind
of
review
that
he
would
have
had
without
aedpa,
because
competency
is
a
factual
matter,
and
for
example
in
demosthenes
v.
baal
and
maggio
v.
fulford
this
court
made
very
clear
that,
even
without
aedpa,
there's
a
factual
issue
which
the
courts,
the
federal
courts
must
defer
to,
and
so
this
court
on--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--what
i'm
saying,
though,
is
that
it
is
consistent
to
say
that
this
is
an
appropriate
way
to
limit
the
kinds
of
issues
that
are
going
to
come
in
front
of
the
district
court,
which
doesn't
drastically--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--right.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
i
think
the
bottom
line
is
it's
a
choice
that
congress
is
entitled
to
make,
that
we
are
dealing
with
a
statute...
this
is
where
the
entitlement
comes
from,
that
it
is
a
statute
which
congress
can
say,
we
will
allow
the
courts
to
hear
certain
types
of
claims,
just
as
this
court
said,
we're
not
going
to
let
you
hear
fourth
amendment
claims
any
more.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
i
have
to
disagree
with
you
on
that,
because
this
court
has
repeatedly
made
clear,
for
example
in
moralis
v.
tva...
excuse
me,
twa,
legislative
history
need
not
confirm
details
of
changes
in
the
law
before
we
interpret
it
according
to
its
plain
meaning,
and
there
are
other
cases
which
show
you
don't
have
to
find
that
congress--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--looked
at
the
nitty
gritty
of
every
possibility--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--that's
correct.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
because
of
the
very
specific
manner
in
which
the
ninth
circuit
ruled,
it
seems
to
take
it
out
of
the
ambit
of
that
preclusion.
the
language
of
the--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--yes,
sir.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
but
it
said
that
we're
allowing
you
to
do
this
because
we're
not
going
to
find
it
was--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--exactly.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
two
answers.
first
of
all,
there
are
the
cases
which
i
cited,
including
mcnary
v.
the
asian
refugees
center
and
robison
v.
johnson,
which
indicate
that
when
you're
talking
about
not
a
specific
determination
under
a
statutory
scheme,
but
the
validity
and
construction
of
a
scheme
as
a
whole,
that
it's
not
subject
to
those
kinds
of
limitations
on
review,
that
we're
not
looking
at
this
point
about
the
propriety
of
them
saying,
this
is
an
okay
successive
petition
because
they
said,
this
is
not
even
a
successive
petition.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
right.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
and
the
second
point
is
that,
because...
first
of
all,
those
cases
would
indicate
that
statutory
cert
is
appropriate
to
review
the
overall
construction
of
the
statute,
but
secondly,
as
i
pointed
out,
and
why
we
brought
a
combined
petition
in
the
first
place,
is
that
the
issues
in
this
case
are
of
such
importance
that
they
warrant
review
under
the
extraordinary
writ
if
somehow
they
don't
fall
under
the
statutory
writ.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
again,
that
is
why
we
presented
it
in
both
lights.
our--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--yes.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
well,
again
i
think
part
of
the
answer
is
that
at
stage
he
doesn't
have
a
claim
that
he
can
present
anyway.
it
is
simply
not
justiciable
at
that
stage.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
and
congress
has
now
said
that
the
appropriate
means
of
dealing
with
that
is
through
the
kind
of
ford
evidentiary
hearing
that
we
had
in
the
superior
court
in
arizona,
plus
arizona
supreme
court
review,
plus
cert
to
this
court,
much
like
the
pattern
that
has
followed
for
federal
prisoners.
federal
prisoners
only
have
one
bite
at
post
conviction
relief
through
their
own
system.
all
that
congress
has
done
here
is
said,
okay,
in
these
kinds
of
claims
you
have
exactly
that
same
situation.
you
go
through
your
state
post
conviction
relief
to
the
u.s.
supreme
court
and
that's
the
end
of
it,
and
are
cut
off
in
these
kinds
of
cases
from
taking
a
second
route
through
the
federal
courts.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
if
the
whole
thing
is
dismissed
out
so
there's
no
action,
no
adjudication,
then
that
would
not
be
a
successive
application.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
indeed
it
would,
and--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--he
might
well
be
barred
that
way
and
also,
as
the
ninth
circuit
pointed
out,
that
when
you
come
in
you
get
the
automatic
stay
the
first
time
around
for
those
other
nonmental
issues,
then
you've
automatically
rendered
the
issue
nonripe
again,
and
so
what
we're
actually
doing
is
saying,
we
want
to
get
the
mental
competency
issue
done
in
an
expeditious
manner.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
right.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
that's
correct.
it
is
an
issue
which
reasonably
cannot...
or
legally
cannot
be
raised
at
that
point
at
all,
and
you're
left
to
the
very
specific
avenue
of
state--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--well--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--well,
that
very
denial
would
itself
be
grounds,
i
would
suggest,
to
come
before
this
court.
for
example,
there's
an
old
case
called
file
v.
duffy,
where
it
was
claimed
that
the
custodian
was
not
looking
into
the
competency
of
the
individual,
and
so
it
was
brought
through
the
california
supreme
courts
and
to
this
court
by
way
of
mandamus
on
the
basis
that
denial
of
any
kind
of
review
was
itself
a
constitutional--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--at
that
point
it
would
be
ripe--
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
--because
the
execution
would
be
imminent.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
bruce
m.
ferg
very
briefly,
your
honor,
as
ms.
young's
argument
conceded
and
as...
similar
to
what
her
brief
was,
this
case
hinges
to
some
degree
on
whether
or
not
successive
in
the
current
statute
has
the
same
meaning,
the
same
term
of
art
that
it
was
before,
and
i
want
to
show
you
that
it
does
not.
in
kuhlman
v.
wilson,
going
back
all
the
way
to
sanders,
this
court
said
that
a
successive
petition
raises
grounds
identical
to
those
raised
and
rejected
on
the
merits
in
a
prior
application.
here,
we
look
at
2244(b)(2)
that
says
that
a
claim
presented
in
a
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
application
that
was
not
presented,
therefore
it
is
plain
that
congress
was
using
second
or
successive
in
a
form
and
meaning
entirely
different
from
this
term
of
art
that
you
had
in
kuhlman
v.
wilson.
