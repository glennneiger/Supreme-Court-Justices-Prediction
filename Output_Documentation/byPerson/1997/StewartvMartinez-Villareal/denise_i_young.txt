ms.
denise
i.
young
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
very
important,
what
we've
just
heard
here
today
from
the
state
of
arizona.
they
agree
that
second
or
successive
in
2244(b)
cannot
be
read
to
mean
any
numerically
second
petition
is
out.
that's
just
what
mr.
ferg
told
us.
so
what
that
means
is
now
we've
got
to
construe
the
statute,
and
that's
what
we
have
been
asking
this
court
to
do,
and
that's
exactly
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
below.
the
next
thing
that
mr.
ferg
told
us
today
is
that
we
can
agree
that
a
claim
that
can't
be
presented
is
not
presentable,
does
not
fall
within
2244(b),
that
that
type
of
claim
will
not
be
considered
a
second
or
successive
when
that
petitioner
comes
back
to
this
court,
comes
back
to
the
district
court
in
a
numerically
second
petition.
that's
exactly
what
we
have
here.
this
is
a
claim
that
the
state
of
arizona
said
in
the
lower
court
at
the
time
of
the
first
petition
was
not
presentable.
they
told
the
district
court
that
there
was
no
case
or
controversy,
no
jurisdictionally
sufficient
case
to
have
that
litigated.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor,
and
that's
what
the
court
decided
and
it
dismissed
it
without
prejudice
and
everybody
knew
that,
at
the
time
of
that
dismissal,
if
mr.
martinez-villareal
were
to
lose,
ultimately...
remember,
at
that
time
he
had
won
on
an
ineffective
claim
at
sentencing,
which
the
court
of
appeals
later
reversed
on
a
procedural
default,
but
everybody
knew
at
that
time
that
mr.
martinez-villareal
would
be
back
if,
in
fact,
he
didn't
prevail
in
the
court
of
appeals
to
litigate
this
very
claim
that
everybody
agreed
he
could
litigate
at
the
proper
time.
now,
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
in
construing
this
language
agreed
that
this
type
of
claim
does
not
fall
within
second
or
successive.
ms.
denise
i.
young
no,
it
was
not,
your
honor
but,
as
justice
o'connor
mentioned,
all
the
courts
had
held
at
that
time,
before
aedpa,
that
ford
claims
were
not
subject
to
abuse,
and
that
they
were
routinely
raised
for
the
first
time
in
second
or
successive
petitions.
this
is
a
case
where
you
have
a
petitioner's
counsel
who's
making
sure
that
all
diligent
conduct
is--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--it
has...
what...
our
position
is
that
this
case
doesn't
fall
within
2244(b).
it--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
we
do--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
right.
that's
exactly
right,
and
so
we
do
not
fall
within
the
2244(b)
because
what
2244(b)
is
looking
at
are
claims
that
had
been
presented.
our
claim
was
one
that
was
never
presentable.
ms.
denise
i.
young
there's
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
in
order
to
get
to
(b)(2)
you've
got
to
start
off
with...
to
get
to
(b)(2)(ii)
i
guess
is
what
you're
talking
about
you
have
to
start
off
with
(ii)
and
look
to
see
what
they're
talking
about,
and
they're
talking
about--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--i'm
sorry.
2244(b)(2)(b)...
i'm
talking
about
2244(b)(2),
and
then--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
and
it
starts
out
a
claim...
or,
i'm
sorry.
i
need
to
go
to...
yes.
a
claim
presented.
that's
right,
(b)(2),
a
claim
presented
in
a
second
or
successive
application
under
22...
that
was
not
presented...
we
have
a
claim
that
was
not
presentable,
so
that's
number
1.
then
number
2,
getting
to
your
question,
is
what
they
were
looking
at
here
was
facts
that
had
not
been
discovered
before.
we
have
a
claim
that
was
legally
impossible
to
have
brought
before--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--not
facts.
ms.
denise
i.
young
and
that
situation,
it
seems
to
me,
that
congress
envisioned
was
a
petitioner,
the
same
petitioner
coming
back
and
attacking
the
same
judgment.
that's
what
congress
was
looking
at,
was
going
after
in
these
cases.
they
wanted
to
stop
relitigation
by
same
petitioners
attacking
the
same
judgment
and,
as
this
court
said
in
felker,
we're
going
to
approve
this
restriction
for
those
kinds
of
successive,
truly
successive
petitions.
that's
what
that's
looking
at.
this
isn't
a
successive
petition.
we
are
going
to
restrict
that,
and
that
will
be
a
modified
res
judicata.
ms.
denise
i.
young
they
do
mention
successive,
your
honor.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i
believe
this
court
looked
at
that
in
felker
and
said
this
is
a
modification
on
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine,
so
i
think
this
is...
i
agree,
it
goes
far
beyond
what
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
was
before
under
mccleskey,
which
was--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
true,
and
the--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
as
that
language
is
understood
in
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine,
that's
a
term
of
art.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--i
think
it
means
that
it
was
a
claim
that
was
presentable
in
a
prior
petition.
that's
the...
the
term
of
art
has
been
in
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine,
second
or
successive,
all
along.
that's
not
new.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i
believe
that's
read
into
it
by
saying,
a
claim
presented,
which
by
its
terms
doesn't
include
a
claim
that
was
never
presentable.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that
would--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
again,
the
best
that
i
can
do,
your
honor,
is
to
say
that
what
they
were
talking
about
here
when
they
were...
when
they
use
those
words,
a
claim
presented,
is
that
it
was
something
that
the...
that
could
have
been
presented.
it
was
that
the--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that...
pardon?
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
and--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
that's
right.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
well,
in
here
what
we're
looking
at
is
second
or
successive
to
what,
and
we
have
a
completely
different
judgment.
our
judgment
is
a...
is
the
first
judgment
that
we
are
now
challenging,
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
mr.
martinez-villareal
is
to
be
executed
while
he
is
incompetent.
that
is
our
challenge,
and
that--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
exactly
right.
that
is
exactly
right.
we
are...
the
ninth
circuit
below
analyzed
our
case
to
those
exhaustion
cases,
but
you're
right,
we're
better
than
those
exhaustion
cases,
because
this
is
an
entirely
different
judgment
and
in
those
cases
they
were
attacking
the
same
judgment.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i
think
that
that's
going
to
have
to
be
something
that
the
district
court,
which
is
something
typical
that
district
courts
do,
will
need
to
decide,
but
that's
right,
there
are
those
type
of
cases
where
the
evidence
would
be
so
apparent
that
counsel
is
under
an
obligation
to
raise
that,
and
the
mental
illness
is
such
that's
not
going
to
change.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that
kind
of
delay,
if,
in
fact,
there
is...
if,
in
fact,
there's
a
question
that
this
claim
should
have
been
brought
earlier
and
we
could
have
ended
all
of
the
litigation,
if
all
we're
talking
about
is
whether
this
person
is
too
incompetent
to
be
executed--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--i--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--and
that's
right.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
i
don't
mean
to
be
confusing,
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
i
think
there
are
some
circumstances
where,
if
the
attorney
raises
the
claim
in
the
first
petition,
the
district
court
can
then
take
a
look
at
it
and
say,
i've
looked
at
what
you've
brought
me
and
this
petitioner
is
clearly
incompetent,
he's
clearly
very
mentally
ill,
and
he's
never
going
to
get
any
better,
i
don't
see
any
reason
to
delay
this.
the
other
situation
where
it
could
come
up
where
it
would
no
longer
be
premature
would
be
the
situation
if
a
petitioner
came
in
with
various
claims
besides
his
incompetency
to
be
executed
under
a
warrant
of
execution
and
the
district
court
said,
i
don't
find
any
of
your
other
claims
meritorious.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i
would
think
that
would
probably
be
a
better
claim
to
be
raised
in
a
1983
than
in
a
2254,
the
clemency
attack.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
i
would
think
so,
because
that's
what
their...
they
would
be
attack...
i
guess
you
could
go
under
either
a
2241
or
a
1983.
ms.
denise
i.
young
oh.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i
have...
i
am
not
sure.
it
just...
it
strikes
me,
the
way
that
you
were
describing
it,
that
that
would
probably
be
a
claim
that
would
be
brought
under
1983
rather
than
under
22...
rather
than
under
habeas.
now,
as
we've
been
talking
about
there's
two
different
reasons
for
the
correctness
of
the
court
of
appeals
decision
below,
and
one
is
that
this
is
not
a
second
or
successive
petition
because
there
was
no
first
one
challenging
the
same
judgment,
and
the
constitutional
violation,
as
the
state
of
arizona
said
in
the
first
proceeding,
had
not
occurred
and
didn't
occur
until
the
execution
warrant
issued,
and
that
is
the
separate
judgment.
the
other
grounds
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct
as
well,
however,
was
that
this
was
a
claim
that
was
dismissed
without
prejudice,
and
at
that
point
everybody
knew
that
mr.
martinez-villareal
was
going
to
come
back
and,
as
we've
talked
about,
those
claims
are...
this
claim
was...
is
analogous
to
the
exhaustion
claims
where
there
is
some
impediment
to
a
determination
and
here
is
absolutely
nothing
in
any
of
the
congressional
history
that
supports
congress'
intent
to
not
allow
a
petitioner
to
bring
at
the
first
opportunity
to
have
this
claim
litigated.
there's
nothing
that
says
that
congress
intended
to
stop
that.
in
fact,
what
congress
was
getting
at,
as
we
talked
about,
was
relitigation,
but
they
were
wanting
to
ensure
that
every
petitioner
had
one
bite
at
the
apple.
those
are
the
key
phrases
when
you
go
through
all
of
the
legislative
history
that
you
see,
and
so
we
also--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--and
i--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--if
you're
attacking
the
same
judgment
and
it's...
again,
i
think
what
they
are
trying
to
get
at
there
is,
they
are
concerned
about
delay,
and
what
they're
telling
lawyers,
you
better
take
a
look
at
this.
we
are
encouraging
you,
you
better
get
out
there,
you
better
investigate,
you
better
bring
all
your
facts
to
us
and
discover
all
your
claims
the
first
time.
ms.
denise
i.
young
and
i
will
say
i
think
that
some...
some...
but
it's
not
this
case,
but
i
think
the
case
that
may
be
in
front
of
you
at
some
point,
that
you're
going
to
have
to
decide
whether
that's
constitutional.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
true
on
the
same
judgment,
and
as
i
said,
it's--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's
right,
and
that's
why
it's
still...
the
abuse
of
the
writ
is
still
in
here,
but
it's
very,
very
restricted.
you
need--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--you
have
to
meet
these
conditions.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's...
this
court,
of
course,
hasn't
decided
whether
it
includes
a
claim
that
goes
to
punishment
or
not
under
sawyer
v.
whitley
and
the
miscarriage
of
justice--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--no,
because--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--well,
that's
because,
your
honor,
that
judgment
is
still
attacking
the
judgment
of
guilt
and
the
sentence.
that's
not
what
we
are
attacking.
we
are
not
attacking...
in
your
hypothetical
that's
what
it
would
be.
you're
saying
that
there's
an
ineffective
claim
being
raised
for
the
third
time
by
the...
in
state
post
conviction,
for
example.
well,
that
constitutional
violation
is
again
attacking
the
same
judgment
of
conviction
and
sentence.
that's
not
what
we're
attacking
here
at
all.
we
are
attacking
the
judgment
of
the
arizona
supreme
court
that
they
are
to
execute...
they're
going
to
take
mr.
martinez-villareal
out
of
his
cell
and
execute
him
on
this
date
while
he's
incompetent.
ms.
denise
i.
young
it's
a
new
constitutional...
the
constitutional
violation,
that's
when
it
occurs
for
the
first
time,
is
based
on
that
order,
based
on
that
judgment.
that's
when
the
constitutional
violation
arises,
and
that--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--well,
ford
disagrees
with
that.
this
court
in
ford
found
that
habeas
was
the
proper
place
to
raise
it,
and
there's
no
question
in
my
mind
that
there
is
custody
here
when
there
is
an
order
that's
going
to
take
someone
from
their
cell
over
to
another
place
and
execute
them.
they
are
being
held
in
custody
in
violation
of
the
eighth
amendment.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
true,
and
it's
there...
pardon?
ms.
denise
i.
young
and
that's
very
similar,
your
honor,
to
the
challenges
made
to
death
sentences
in
cases
all
the
time.
you're
not
asking
that
the
petitioner
be
released
from
custody.
you're
asking
that
the
death
sentence
be
set
aside.
that's
no
different
than
this
case.
the
other
point
i
also--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes,
that's
true.
yes,
that's
absolutely
true,
there
is
that
distinction,
but
again,
custody
arises
as
a
result
of
this
new
violation
to
execute
him
at
that
point,
and
it
seems
to
me
very
analogous
to
those
cases.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make,
and
it's...
would...
it's
a
point
that
would
allow
this
court
to
decide
this
case
on
the
most
narrowest
of
grounds,
and
that's
waiver
based
on
the
state's
action
in
this
case,
in
which
they
were
the
ones
who
asked
for
multiple
proceedings,
in
which
they
were
the
ones
who
asked
that
the
district
court,
who
told
the
district
court
and
assured
the
district
court
and
the
ninth
circuit
that
they--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
i
was
just
offering
you
the
opportunity
that
if
you...
if--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--and
i
agree
with
that.
i
couldn't
agree
with
that
more.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes.
we...
i...
but
again,
i
believe
this
court,
if
you
are
going
to
reach
this
case
and
decide
this
case,
it
should
affirm
the
court
of--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
now,
in
the
first...
i'm
sorry,
i
need
to...
in
the
first--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--he
won
it,
can
he
come
back
in
the
second
one?
ms.
denise
i.
young
oh,
without
any
change
in
his
condition?
ms.
denise
i.
young
and
raise
claims
other
than
his
competency?
ms.
denise
i.
young
well,
i
assume
he
could
come
back
and
try,
but
he
certainly
would
have
a
huge
burden
to
overcome,
because...
oh...
oh,
without
any
change.
ms.
denise
i.
young
i'm
sorry.
i
misunderstood
you.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes.
ms.
denise
i.
young
so
they
found
him
incompetent--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--yes,
he
could--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--he
could
come
back,
because
again
there
would
have
been
a
new
judgment,
the
execution
warrant
saying
that
now
we're
going
to
go
execute
you,
and
as
we've
been
talking
about,
it's
that
piece
of
paper
that
would
allow
him
to
come
back
in
and
not
be
a
second
or
successive--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--it
is
something
sort
of
out
of
the
1800's.
it's
kind
of
an
executive
detention
sort
of
thing,
and
that's
right,
but
that
is
what
we're
challenging,
because
that's
when
the
constitutional
violation
arises,
when
the
state
seeks
to
execute
somebody
who
is
incompetent.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes,
he
could.
now,
some
states
have
laws
that
say
that
if
someone...
for
example,
as
arizona,
if
someone
is
found
incompetent
to
be
executed
they're
taken
to
a
mental
hospital
and
in
30
days
their
competency
is
reassessed,
so
if
they
had
their
competency
reassessed
and
they
say,
now
he's
competent,
we're
going
forward,
those...
that
is
a
situation
where,
under
justice
stevens'
hypothetical,
that
person
could
come
back
in
and
challenge
it
and
say--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--no.
ms.
denise
i.
young
that's
right,
yes.
if
there's
still
a
stay
of
execution
in
force
then
the
state
wouldn't
have...
would...
well,
i
wouldn't
think
the
state
would
have
any
authority
to
go
forward
and
issue
a
new
warrant
if
that
was
still
in
force.
i
was
unclear
whether
the
stay
of
execution
was
still
in
force,
but
yes,
if
you
have
a
judgment
of
incompetency
that
would
make
complete
sense
to
me.
ms.
denise
i.
young
well,
your
honor,
what
we...
what
we
are
saying
at
this...
that
(b)(3)(e)
is
getting
at
is
telling
this...
is
congress
telling
this
court
that
they
don't
want
you
messing
around
with
the
authorization
decisions
no
matter
what
the
result
is,
that
those
are
proceedings
that
they
don't
want
to
have
delay
from.
they
want
to
expedite
the
proceedings
whether
they...
the
court
decides
that--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--it
is.
ms.
denise
i.
young
yes.
that--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--that's...
that's
true,
but
i'm
also
offering
you
another
way
of
looking
at
that
statute,
which
is
that
any
gatekeeper
decision,
which
is
what
this
was...
it
was
a
gatekeeper
decision
saying,
you
didn't
need
to
come
here,
by
the
way,
that
any
gatekeeper
decision,
congress
is
saying
that
this
court
does
not
have
cert
jurisdiction
over.
but
you're
right,
as
well,
though,
if
you
don't
decide
that,
if
you
don't
construe
the
statute
in
that
way,
then
that's
right.
there
would...
you
would
have
cert
jurisdiction.
ms.
denise
i.
young
it--
ms.
denise
i.
young
--except
that
i
believe
that
this
statute
can
be
read,
the
jurisdictional
portion
of
the
statute
can
be
read
to
say
it
covers
any
authorization
decision
made
by
the
court
of
appeals,
that
this
court
is
to
stay
out
of
that,
because
they
want
to
expedite
the
procedure.
it
doesn't
mean
you're
not
going
to
get
to
hear
that
claim
eventually.
you
are.
you
could
get
review
later.
ms.
denise
i.
young
then
i
will
stick
with
the
argument
that
you
have
just...
that's
fine.
i
will...
i'm
just
telling
you
that's
another
way
of
taking
a
look
at
it.
thank
you.
