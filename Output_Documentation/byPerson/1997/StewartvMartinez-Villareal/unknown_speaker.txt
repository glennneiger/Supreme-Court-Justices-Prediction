unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
think
that
congress
may
have
been
trying
to
tighten
up
the
court's
abuse
of
the
writ
standards
in
passing
aedpa?
unknown
speaker
before
we
had
aedpa,
did
courts,
do
you
think,
apply
abuse
of
the
writ
standards
to
ford
claims
at
all?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
they
did.
a
ford
claim
is
a
little
different,
since
it
seems
to
arise
later
after
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
and
relate
to
a
defendant's
mental
condition
at
the
time
of
a
scheduled
execution,
so
it
wasn't
the
kind
of
application
that
triggered
abuse
of
the
writ
analysis
before
aedpa,
was
it?
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
think
we
do
post-aedpa
with
claims
that
really
arise
later,
such
as
claims
arising
out
of
the
establishment
of
good
time
credits
or
something
of
that
sort?
what
do
we
do?
do
we
say
that
that's
a
successive
application
for
habeas
if
the
thing
couldn't
even
have
been
raised
until
good
time
credits
were
denied?
unknown
speaker
is
that
the
position
you
take,
that
aedpa
goes
that
far
and
that
it
extends
to
even
those
things
that
could
not
have
arisen
before--
unknown
speaker
--the
claim
was
made?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
unknown
speaker
how
about
a
rose
v.
lundy
problem?
an
applicant
comes
in
with
several
claims
on
federal
habeas
and
the
district
court
says,
well,
you
didn't
exhaust
in
state
court
some
of
these.
i'm
going
to
dismiss
everything
and
send
you
back.
now,
if
a
second
habeas
is
then
filed,
you
would
say
aedpa
bars
that
there?
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm,
yes.
unknown
speaker
was
the
ford
claim
made
in
the
petitioner's
first
petition?
unknown
speaker
and
the
federal
court
said
no,
we
can't
deal
with
this
now.
unknown
speaker
but
we'll
deal
with
it
later.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
that
determination
should
have
been
appealed,
i.e.,
he
should
have
said
yes,
it
is
ripe?
unknown
speaker
so
what
more
could
he
have
done?
unknown
speaker
in
view
of
your
answer
about
exhaustion,
failure
to
exhaust,
so
it's
dismissed,
and
then
it
comes
back
after
aedpa,
and
you
said
effectively
that
would
not
be
a
successive
petition,
suppose
the
ford
claim
were
the
only
claim
brought
up
in
the
first
habeas,
and
the
district
court
says,
it's
not
ripe,
you
get
a
competency
hearing
in
the
state
court...
it's
so
close
to
exhaustion.
so
your
original
answer
was,
but
this
person
had
other
claims
that
were
adjudicated.
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
had
been
only
the
ford
claim.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that...
yes,
there
was
a
decision.
you
say,
well,
it
may
not
be
successive.
it
sure
is
second,
because
there
was
a
first
one
and
this
is
a
second
one,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
if
we're
going
to
read
the
statute
in
that
sort
of...
taking
the
terminology
on
its
face,
i
don't
see
why
your
answer
hasn't
got
to
be
the
opposite
of
what
you
gave.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose--
--you
think
the
case
we
just
heard
was
a
nothing,
because
that
also
involved
sort
of
a
ripeness
question,
which
is
the
same
kind
of
a
question
as
a...
as
the
timeliness
of
the
challenge
to
a
competency
hearing.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
call
that
case
a
nothing.
i
mean,
there
was
a
lot
of
argument
about
whether,
indeed,
it
was
timely
or
not.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
another
question.
do
you
think
that
a
so-called
ford
claim,
somebody
who
says,
i'm
not
mentally
competent
to
be
executed,
could
be
raised
under
section
1983
rather
than
habeas?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
this
person
is
not
before
the
courts
arguing
that
he
is
being
held
in
violation
of
federal
law.
he
just
says,
i
can't
be
executed
without
a
determination
of
my
mental
capacity.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
that
it's
a
circumvention.
i'm
trying
to
find
out
if
traditional
habeas
relief
fits
this
type
of
claim.
unknown
speaker
we've
used
habeas
for
all
sorts
of
matters
relating
to
the
propriety
of
execution,
haven't
we,
whether
it's
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
whether
certain
procedures
have
to
be
used,
and
that
doesn't
relate
to
the
detention
of
the
individual.
unknown
speaker
i
sort
of
favor
using
habeas
for
what
it
ought
to
be
used
for,
but
i
think
we
crossed
that
bridge
a
long
time
ago.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that's
so...
if
that's
so,
then
isn't
what's
before
the
court
not...
he's
not
challenging
his
underlying
conviction,
and
he's
not
challenging
the
sentence
he
got.
he's
challenging
now
in
the
federal
court
something
different,
which
is
the
competency
adjudication
in
the
state
court.
that's
a
different
target.
i
don't
see
how
that's
successive
of
anything
that
was
focusing
on
the
conviction
and
the
sentence
instead
of
the
competency
determination.
unknown
speaker
but
you've
already
told
me
that
you
don't
take
that
so
formally
that
in
dealing
with
the
dismissed
case
because
of
exhaustion
for...
that
technically
that's
a
second...
it's
the
second
time
he's
filed.
i
don't
understand
why
those
two
would
be
different,
if
you
say,
and
he
has
never
before
attacked
the
determination
that
was
just
made
in
the
arizona
state
court
that
he
is
competent,
that
was
just
made
last
week.
why
isn't
that
not
successive?
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
congress
wanted
the
result
that
justice
ginsburg
is
discussing?
i
mean,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
congress
somehow
wanted
to
take
this
unusual
set
of
claims
that
arise
only,
and
can
by
their
very
nature
arise
only
well
after
the
trial
itself,
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
trial,
that
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
appeals...
it
would
be
a
claim,
for
example,
saying
we're
going
to
torture
someone
to
death,
or
i
mean,
you
know,
some
frightful
thing,
think
of
some
awful
thing,
and
it
could
never
have
arisen
before.
i
mean,
is
there
any
reason
congress
would
have
wanted
to
bar
habeas
totally
from
such
a
claim?
i
can't
think
of
one,
and
if
there
is
none,
and
no
evidence
they
wanted
to,
can't
you
just
read
a
claim
not
to
include
that
kind
of
claim?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
your
answer
was
going
to
be
simply
section
2244(b)(2)(b),
which
makes
it
very
clear
that
the
mere
fact
that
something
couldn't
have
been
raised
earlier,
because
the
factual
predicate
did
not
exist,
is
not
alone
enough.
i
mean,
that
makes
it
very
clear
that
that's
not
enough.
unknown
speaker
in
addition
to
that,
the
fact...
those
new
facts
have
to
show
that
the
defendant
was
innocent
of
the
underlying
offense.
unknown
speaker
if
you're
trying
to
get
at
that,
i
was
talking
about
a
claim
that
not
only
couldn't
have
been
raised
earlier,
but
one
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
trial
or
the
appeal
process.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
trial
itself.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
jury,
that
it's
totally
beside
the
point
whether
a
jury
would
or
would
not
have
thought
the
person
was
innocent.
in
other
words,
all
those
things
in
(b)(2)
just
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
kind
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask...
maybe
i'm
going
to
pose
the
same
kind
of
question
that's
been
posed
before,
but
let
me
pose
it
in
a
slightly
different
way.
i'm
going
to
start
with
an
assumption
which
i
think
you
do
not
share,
and
that
is
that
even
you
do
not
read
second
and
successive
in
a
literal
way,
and
i
realize
you
think
you
do,
but
i
start
with
the
premise
that
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
what
i
assume
to
begin
with,
then
i'm
faced
with
the
following
kind
of
question:
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
jurisdiction
of
a
court
to
entertain
a
competency
claim
based
upon
what
seems
to
be
the
totally
capricious
circumstance
that
it
was
or
was
not
joined
in
the
first
instance
with
some
other
claims?
this
seems
to
me
a
very
difficult
question
when
one
accepts,
as
i
think
we
both
do,
the
premise
that
the
claim
does
have
to
be
ripe,
and
you
can't
come
in
the
week
after
conviction,
when
you
don't
know
when
you're
going
to
be
executed
and
say,
well,
i'm
not
competent
to
be
executed.
if
we
do
not
start
with
the
premise
that
the
terms
literally
mean
what
they
mean
and
have
got
to
be
applied
in
that
way
right
down
the
line,
why
would
it
not
be
sensible
to
say,
congress
surely
would
not
have
intended
to
cover
this
rather...
or
to
mandate
this
rather
capricious
distinction
and
hence
throw
this
fellow
out
of
the
federal
court?
what's
the
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't
go
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
ultimately
to
entertain
the
claim.
unknown
speaker
but
it
doesn't...
i
have
the
same
question
as
justice
souter.
you
have
two
cases.
one
case,
all
he
does
is
bring
a
competency...
a
claim
that
he's
incompetent
to
be
executed.
unknown
speaker
that's
all
he
brings,
and
the
state
comes
rushing
in
and
says,
premature,
and
it's
dismissed.
it's
premature,
not
ripe.
case
number
1.
case
number
2,
different
defendant,
he's
got
30
claims,
and
he
adds
the
competency
claim.
why
should
those
cases
come
out
differently?
in
case
number
1
you're
going
to
be
able
to
hear
the
claim
later.
case
number
2,
you're
not.
that
just
makes
no
sense.
and
i
think
that
was
the
substance
of
justice
souter's
question,
and
i
don't
think
you've
answered
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
congress
had
said
that
in
any
direct
way,
you'd
be
well
on
the
road
to
your
argument,
but
you're
basically
saying...
in
fact,
you
said
literally
a
few
moments
ago,
this
is
just
like
mccardle.
it's
not
like
mccardle.
there
was
no
question
about
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
and
literally
clearly
did
do
in
the
statute
that
was
at
issue
there.
here,
we...
if
we
accept
your
position
we
are
saying
that
for
all
practical
purposes,
in
any
case
in
which
there's
more
than
one
possible
claim
on
habeas,
congress
has,
without
ever
expressing
directly
the
question
of
this
subject
matter
jurisdiction
point,
indirectly
ruled
out
the
subject
of
competency
claims
for
federal
courts.
this
isn't
straightforward
like
mccardle.
it's
exactly
the
opposite,
and
it
would
attribute
to
congress
either
a
very
strange
inadvertence,
since
ford
claims
are
well-known,
or
a
rather
underhanded
way
of
doing
business,
which
we
just
don't...
we
don't
attribute
that
to
congress.
that
isn't
the
way
we
assume
they
work.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--we're
back
to
plain
meaning
again,
and
i
think
the...
as
i
said,
i
realize
that
you
and
i
do
not
agree
entirely
on
that,
but
if
we
don't
think
that
a
simple,
literal
plain
meaning
analysis
is
going
to
be
applicable
here
because
of
exactly
the
case
that
you
concede
would
be
allowed
as
a
second
shot,
then
i
think
the
question
is
more
pointed
than,
or
more
difficult
than
you're
admitting.
may
i
ask
you
before
you
close
to...
first,
if
i
understand,
your
theory
is
this
is
a
second...
a
successive
application.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
theory
on
why
we
have
jurisdiction,
given
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
that
says
the
grant
or
denial
of
a
successive
application
shall
not
be
appealable
and
shall
not
the
subject
of
a
petition
for
rehearing
or
writ
of
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
well...
it's...
under
your
view,
it
is
a
second,
successive,
right...
second
or
successive
application.
unknown
speaker
and
it
was
granted...
the
court
of
appeals
said
it
shall
be
granted
by
the
district
court,
they
shall
entertain
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
say...
but
you
say
they
were
wrong
on
that.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
you
can't
say
they're
both
right
and
wrong.
if
your
theory
is
they
were
wrong,
and
having
accepted...
if
we
agree
with
you
on
that
proposition,
how
do
we
have
jurisdiction
to
hear
the
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
that's...
but
i'm
taking
you
at
your
word,
not
them--
unknown
speaker
--because
you're
saying
they're
wrong.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
we
permit
such
inconsistent
pleading,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
all
the
time
when
we
reverse
a
court
of
appeals
which
has
decided
a
case
that
the
petitioner
claims...
for
which
the
petitioner
claims
there
was
no
jurisdiction.
for
instance,
if
the
petitioner
says
there's
no
standing,
he
comes
here
and
says,
this
court
doesn't
have
any
jurisdiction,
and
neither
did
the
lower
court.
yes,
but
we
never
do
that
by
adopting
both
of
the
inconsistencies.
we
take
one
or
the
other
when
we
do
it,
we
rule.
we
don't
take
them
both.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
again
about
the
distinction
between
the
one
who
brings
just
the
ford
claim,
which
you
say
that's
okay.
he
hasn't
had
a
first
petition,
effectively.
would
a
person
who
combines
them
might
have
this
in
mind,
or
the
lawyer:
my
client
is
incompetent.
i
want
to
make
sure
that
ultimately
the
federal
court
hears
that.
but
if
i
don't
bring
it
up
along
with
these
others,
i
may
be
caught
in
a
procedural
default
when
i
come
back,
so
i
have
to
put
it
in
with
the
other
22.
i
really
don't
have
a
choice
to
leave
it
out.
so
you're
saying,
well,
if
you
want
the
ford
claim
to
survive,
you
have
to
forfeit
all
those
other
claims.
that...
the
distinction
between
the
one
who
brings
the
ford
claim
alone--
unknown
speaker
--as
being
okay,
but
the
one
who
combines
it
with
others
is
not
being
okay,
is
a
little
hard
for
me
to
grasp,
and
i
was
thinking
that
well,
maybe
wouldn't
any
sensible
lawyer
say,
he's
got
some
good
claims.
i
don't
want
to
sacrifice
them.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
then
he
wants
to
be
able
to
come
back.
unknown
speaker
general
ferg,
can
i
clarify
one
thing.
i
just
wasn't
100-percent
sure
of
your
answer.
supposing...
forget
the
ford
claims
for
a
moment.
just
a
mixed...
a
petition
making
four
claims,
two
of
which
were
exhausted,
two
were
not
exhausted,
and
the
district
court
dismisses
on
the
ground
there
wasn't
complete
exhaustion,
then
if
he
comes
back
later,
is
that
a
first
or
a
second
habeas
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
in
your...
okay.
i
take
it
your
position
would
entail
this
strategy
on
the
part
of
careful
lawyers.
let's
assume
they
have
five
serious
habeas
claims
going
to
the
validity
of
the
conviction
and
they
also
anticipate
that
there's
going
to
be
at
the
end
of
the
road
a
competency
claim.
in
order
not
to
be
thrown
out
on
the
competency
claim
they
will
save
their
five
until
the
eve
of
execution
when
their
competency
claim
will
be
ripe,
and
yet
that
will
be
at
the
furthest
possible
remove
from
the
time
of
trial
so
that
if
they
also
happen
to
be
right
on
the
issues
going
to
conviction
it
will
be
more
difficult
then
to
go
back
and
retry
the
case.
that
would
be
a
strange
policy
for
congress
to
want
to
promote,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
the
policy
that
the
careful
lawyer
who
wants
to
avoid
your
argument,
and...
particularly
if
it's
successful,
is
in
fact
going
to
take.
he'd
be
barred
by
the
statute
of
limitations,
wouldn't
he?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
that's
the
point,
it
can't
be
done
at
all
unless
it
is
done
in
relation
to
competency
at
time
of
execution.
unknown
speaker
and
if
somebody
comes
in
before
an
execution
date
is
imminent,
then
that's
why
it's
not
ripe,
and
you
don't...
i
mean,
you
don't
want
to
promote
nonripe
claims.
i
mean,
it's
simply
irrelevant
to
litigate
early
when
the
execution
is
going
to
be
later.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
that
then
undercuts
the
point
that
congress
wanted
these
things
litigated
early.
congress
doesn't
want
these
things
litigated
at
a
time
when
they're
irrelevant.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
your
position
they're...
they
would
be
left
to
the
state
procedure,
but
what
if
the
state
decided
they
won't
have
a
procedure,
which
i
suppose
they
could
do
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
yes,
it
would
be,
but
that
claim
wouldn't
be
ripe
at
any
time.
there
would
be
no
chance
to
raise
it
as
i
see
it.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
ferg.
ms.
young,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
because
it
was
premature
it
would
have
to
be
decided
closer
to
the
time
of
execution?
unknown
speaker
was
aedpa
in
effect
at
the
time
of
the
first
raising
of
this
claim
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
make
any
claim
that
aedpa
shouldn't
apply
to
this
case,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
not
argued
here
or
below
that
the
statute
that
congress
passed
in
the
form
of
aedpa
does
not
apply
to
your
case?
unknown
speaker
you
say--
unknown
speaker
--that
it
is
not
a
successive
petition
under
aedpa.
unknown
speaker
and
you're--
--it
seems
to
me
your
argument
rests
upon
the
premise
that
it's
unreasonable
and
therefore
presumably
not
the
intent
of
2244
that
a
claim
which
could
only
be
raised
later
should
be
barred,
even
if
it
comes
up
in
what
could
in
some
senses
be
called
a
second
application.
i
find
it
difficult
to
square
that
premise
with
the
text
of
2244(b),
which
in
(b)(2)(b)
obviously
envisions
situations
in
which,
even
though
you
couldn't
have
raised
the
claim
before,
the
claim
is
barred.
it
makes
only
one
exception
to
that,
and
that
is
if
the
claim
couldn't
be
raised
before
and
also
is
a
claim
that
would
establish
the
innocence
of
the
underlying
offense.
i
don't
know
any
other
way
to
read
that
provision
than
as
clearly
affirming
congress
doesn't
care
about
certain
claims
that
can
only
be
raised
now
but
nonetheless
congress
says,
even
so,
unless
they
go
to
the
innocence,
go
away.
unknown
speaker
would
you
be
precise
as
to
which
statutory
section?
unknown
speaker
it's
on
page
3
of
the
red--
--page
3
of
the
red
brief.
unknown
speaker
of
the
red
brief,
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
i--
unknown
speaker
--you're
mistaking
my
point.
i
mean,
my
point
is
not
that...
you
know,
that
it
technically
applies
to
you.
my
point
is
simply
that
it
shows
the
willingness
of
congress
to
contemplate
a
situation
in
which
a
claim
could
not
possibly
have
been
brought
any
sooner
but
which
nevertheless
the
federal
court
is
supposed
to
reject.
i
mean,
i'm
not
saying
that
this
text
necessarily
applies
to
this
case.
i'm
just
saying
that
it
shows
a
mentality
on
the
part
of
congress
which
your
premise
contradicts.
you're
saying
congress
couldn't
have
intended
something
that
couldn't
have
been
brought
up
until
now
to
be...
you
know,
to
be
rejected,
yet
that
provision
clearly
envisions
some
situations
where
that
will
happen.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
do
think
it's
significant,
and
don't
you
think
it's
significant
that
this
whole
new
legislation
does
not
mention
the
magic
word
successive,
you
know,
which
had
been
the
buzz
word
for
our
prior
jurisprudence.
it
seems
to
me
they're
trying
to
get
away
from
it.
unknown
speaker
i
mean--
--abusive.
--abuse
of
the
writ,
and
our
whole
prior
case
law
concerning
that.
the
cases
you're
referring
to
are
all
done
under
that.
it
tries
to
get
away
from
that
and
it
just
says
second
or
successive.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you
have...
may
i
interrupt
you
just
with
this
question,
because
i'm
going
astray
here.
haven't
you
also
argued
in
effect
that
we
distinguish
between
abusive
petitions
and
successive
petitions
under
the
old
rule,
and
you're
saying...
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
under
the
old
rule
there
was
at
least
facially
an
argument
that
a
ford
claim
would
be
successive,
but
it
wasn't
treated
as
successive
by
the
lower
courts
and,
in
fact,
your
opposing
counsel
agree
on
that
point,
at
least.
so
i
thought
your
argument
was,
they're
using
the
same
term...
when
they
say
second
or
successive
they're
using
the
same
term
that
was
used
before
and
because
that
term
did
not,
under
the
old
law,
comprehend
a
ford
claim,
you
don't
have
to
read
it
and,
indeed,
shouldn't
read
it
to
comprehend
a
ford
claim
here.
isn't--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
successive
petition.
it
only
has
to
be
a
second
petition.
it
does
say
second
or
successive
petition.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
think
second
or
successive
means
second,
comma,
that
is
to
say,
comma,
successive?
unknown
speaker
second
or
in
other
words
successive?
unknown
speaker
so
you
read
the
statute
as
if
it
read,
a
claim
presented
in
a
second
or
successive
application,
paren,
assuming
it
was
then
presentable,
close
paren?
unknown
speaker
presentable
doesn't
work,
because
you
could
easily
have
new
evidence
discovered
related
to
the
trial,
you
know,
and
it
wasn't
discovered
until
november,
and
by
that
time
the
person
has
filed
13
petitions,
and
clearly
that
falls
within
(b)(2).
you
know,
that's
the
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
--thing
you
can
do
only
under
certain
circumstances,
yet
it
wasn't
presentable
earlier
because
you
never
had
the
new
evidence
earlier,
or
the
brady
material
early,
so
it
must
have
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
word
claim.
it
must
mean
to
include
certain
kinds
of
claims
but
not
mean
those
kinds
of
claims
that,
by
their
very
nature,
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
trial
or
the
process,
could
only
have
arisen
later.
unknown
speaker
in
principle.
but
what's
the
form
of
words
that
captures
what
i
just
said?
unknown
speaker
you'd
say
in
principle
or
something.
unknown
speaker
the
kind
of
claim
that
was
in
principle
presentable
earlier
but
not
the
kind...
even
though
this
one
couldn't
have
been,
a
brady
claim
is
the
kind
that
in
principle
could
be--
unknown
speaker
--presented
earlier.
unknown
speaker
a
ford
claim
is
not
the
kind
that
in
principle
could
have
been
presented
earlier.
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
say
it's
not
a
claim,
or
that
it's
not
successive?
i
thought
your
argument
would
be
that
it's
not
successive
because
successive
obviously
is
a
comparative
term,
successive
in
comparison
to
what--
unknown
speaker
--in...
compared
to
a
claim
that
could
have
been
presented.
unknown
speaker
and
what
makes
you
even
in
a
better
position,
i
suppose,
than
the
person
who
brings
a
first
petition
and
says...
in
the
federal
court
and
says,
go
away,
you
haven't
exhausted,
comes
back
with
a
number
2,
but
it's
not
successive
because
there
was
no
adjudication
of
the
first
one,
but
still
that
is
going
to...
that
is
going
to
the
original
conviction
and
sentence.
here
you
say,
not
only
are
we
the
same
as
the
exhaustion
person,
but
we
have
a
new
target.
we're
not
really
aiming
at
the
conviction,
original
conviction
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
tell
me,
won't
there
be
cases...
maybe
this
case
as
well...
in
which
the
evidence
of
the
incompetency,
the
symptoms,
the
clinical
manifestations
of
the
mental
disturbance
were
apparent
as
of
the
time
of
the
first
petition?
unknown
speaker
they
might
not
have
been
as
aggravated,
but
they
were
apparent
ones.
aren't
we
going
to
have
a
number
of
cases
in
which
the
contention
is,
is
that
this
could
have
been
litigated
when
the
first
claims
were...
when
the
other
claims
were
litigated
early,
early
on?
unknown
speaker
so
you
acknowledge
that
there
will
be
then
some
litigation
over
whether
or
not
this
particular
competence
claim
should
have
been
brought
earlier.
unknown
speaker
now
i'm
beginning
to
lose
you,
because
i
thought
that
the
problem
here
is
that
you
couldn't
bring
it
up
earlier
because
it
wouldn't
be
ripe
until
the
date
of
execution
is
set.
unknown
speaker
because
there's
always
hope
that
somebody
will,
maybe
through
a
miracle,
be
cured.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
it
were
a
claim,
not
for
lack
of
competency,
but
that
the
arizona
clemency
proceeding
which
he
had
applied
to
denied
him
due
process
in
some
way,
would
that,
too,
be
raisable
at
this
point?
it's
really...
it's
not
an
attack
on
the
judgment.
you're--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
think...
you
think
it
could
be
raised
in
1983
rather
than
habeas?
unknown
speaker
well,
that...
now,
that's
supposed
to
be
impossible,
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
that
you
couldn't...
you
could
not
do
both.
unknown
speaker
again,
that
is
simply
not
compatible
with
2244
(b)(2)(b).
unknown
speaker
in
some
cases
under
(b)(2)(b)
you're
not
going
to
have
a
first
bite
at
the
apple.
unknown
speaker
well,
it--
--it
doesn't
have
it.
it
says
under
(b)(2),
even
if
you
have
been
diligent
and
there
are
some
things
that
only
come
up
later
and
you
couldn't
have
brought
it
earlier,
nonetheless
we're
not
always
going
to
let
you
come
in
here.
sometimes
we're
not
even
going
to
give
you
that
first
bite.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
makes
it
hard
for
you
to
argue
that
congress
always
wanted
people
to
have
one
bite
in
federal
court.
it
clearly
excludes
the
first
bite
in
federal
court
in
some
situations.
now,
whether
that's
constitutional
or
not
is
a
different
issue,
but
i
think
your
positing
of
this
congressional
everybody-gets-one-bite
intention
is
simply
contrary
to
the
text
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
it's
even
true
there.
isn't
what
they've
done
is
just
make
that
a
lot
harder
bite
to
make?
i
mean,
they
haven't
totally
excluded
the
claim
if
the
applicant
can
prove
actual
innocence
and
a
new
law,
or
newly
discovered
facts.
he's
not...
he
gets
the
one
shot
at
it.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
a
claim
that
doesn't
go
to--
unknown
speaker
--it
doesn't
go
to
innocence
at
all.
it
may
be
a
claim
that
goes
to
the
manner
of
punishment.
it
may
be
the
claim
that
goes
to
many
other
things.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
it's
helpful
to
say
it's
an
attack
on
a
different
judgment.
a
state
habeas
court
could,
for
the
third
time,
reject
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
claim.
we
wouldn't
say,
oh,
this
is
a
new
judgment.
unknown
speaker
and
so
i
don't
think
that
gets
us
very
far.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
a
new
judgment.
that's
just
an
order
that
the
earlier
judgment
of
the
trial
court
imposing
the
death
penalty
be
enforced.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
this
is
the
kind
of
claim
that
should
be
raised
in
a
section
1983
action,
not
habeas
at
all.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
not
asking
that
he
be
released
from
custody,
just
that
he
not
be
executed.
unknown
speaker
temporarily.
unknown
speaker
i
think
it
is,
because
you're
not
asking
that
the
penalty
be
changed,
just
that
it
be
postponed.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
young,
ordinarily
we
grant
certiorari
to
decide
what
we
regard
as
an
important
question
of
law,
often
because
of
a
split
between
courts
of
appeals.
if
we
decided
this
case
on
the
basis
of
waiver,
we'd
decide
just
this...
it
would
just
be
error
correction
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
correct,
perhaps
we
never
should
have
granted
certiorari.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
sure
it's
still
available
to
you
to
argue
that
even
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
important
question
that
we
took
the
case
to
decide,
we
should
remand
to
let
the
court
of
appeals
consider
whether
a
waiver
would
produce
the
same
result.
i
presume
that's
what
you
would
urge
upon
us.
unknown
speaker
ms.
young,
may
i
ask
you
another
hypothetical
about
your
definition
of
presentable
and
presented
and
so
forth
and
so
on?
unknown
speaker
suppose
a
person
on
death
row
who
has
never
filed
any
habeas
corpus
petition
files
one
that
contains
nothing
but
an
exhausted
ford
claim
and
the
district
court
says,
there's
merit
to
the
claim,
quash
this
death
warrant,
postpone
the
execution,
and
they
do
that,
and
with
no
change
in
facts
whatsoever
the
same
man
comes
back...
they
issue
a
new
death
warrant
10
days
later.
could...
and
without
any
change
in
physical
condition
or
mental
condition.
could
the
man
come
back
without
filing
a
successive
habeas?
unknown
speaker
he
won
the
first
time.
unknown
speaker
can
he
come
back
30
days
later
if
they
try
to
execute
him
without
any
change
in
his
condition?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
no,
raise
the
same
claim.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
he
would
have
won
on--
unknown
speaker
--it's
clear
he
would
win
on
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
but
he
can't
establish
innocence.
he
can't
meet
the...
would
that
be
a
claim
that
was...
that
was
presentable,
too.
unknown
speaker
he
presented
it
and
he
won.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but--
--i
agree
with
justice
kennedy's
point.
i...
to
say
you're
attacking
the
warrant
rather
than
the
judgment,
it
seems
like
something
out
of
the
1800's,
really.
unknown
speaker
in
justice
stevens'
case,
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
he
doesn't
have
to
bring
a
new
habeas
petition
at
all,
all
he
needs
to
do
is
bring
a
petition
to
enforce
the
judgment
that
he
already
has,
since
that
judgment
covers
what
the
state
now
proposes
to
do?
could
he
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
wouldn't
you
take
the
position
that
in
that
circumstance
the
state
has
the
burden
to
come
in,
to
come
forward
and
vacate
the
judgment
that
the
court
had
already...
and
ask
for
a
vacation
of
the
judgment
that
the
court
had
already
rendered
and
until
it
did
that,
you
wouldn't
bring
new
habeas.
unknown
speaker
you'd
just
say,
enforce
what
we've
got.
unknown
speaker
are
you
going
to
stand
by
your
argument
that
this
court
has
no
jurisdiction,
the
one
that
you
made
last
instead
of
first?
first
you
tell
us
it's
not
second
or
successive
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
for
that
purpose,
but
then
for
purposes
of
our
review
you
say
it
is.
that's
how
i
read
your--
unknown
speaker
--if
we're
getting
to
the
purpose
of
congress,
i
thought
it
was
your
theory
that
this
was
not
a
successive--
unknown
speaker
--therefore,
we
have
ordinary
certiorari
jurisdiction
under
your
view.
unknown
speaker
only
if
you
say...
go
the
other
way
do
we
not
have
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
both
for
the
merits
issue
and
the
jurisdictional
issue
the
first
thing
we've
got
to
decide
is
whether
it's
a
second
or
successive
petition
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
unknown
speaker
and
you
just
take
the
position
it
isn't,
he
takes
the
position
it
is.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
why
you
make
that
argument,
because
if
you're
right
on
the
other
argument
you're
going
to
win
on
the
merits,
too.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
ms.
young.
mr.
ferg,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
