justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
relying
on
the
regulations
issued
by
the
department
of
justice
or
those
issued
by
eeoc
earlier?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask...
and
are
they
identical
in
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
function
does
the
justice
department
have
under
title
iii,
other
than
issuing
regulations?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
do
anything
else
under
title
iii?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
administer
title
iii
in
any
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
you
have
a
congress
that's
been
taken
over
by
the
republicans
after
40
years
of
democratic
control
and
democratic
judicial
appointments
and
congress,
this
republican
congress
does
not
like
the
kind
of
decisions
that
democratic
judges
are
going
to
be
making,
can
congress
say
that
the
interpretation
of
statutes
shall
be
governed
by
regulations
issued
by
the
department
of
justice?
i
find
that
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
whole
congress
said
that
through
the
committee
report.
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
those
reports.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
your
answer.
you...
is
there
a
distinction
or
isn't
there
a
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would
think
that
if
hiv...
if
the
inability
to
reproduce
because
of
hiv
qualifies
under
the
statute,
the
inability
to
reproduce
because
of
impotence
or
sterility
would
also--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
arguably,
but
do
you
take
that
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
say
certainly
at
least
some
of
them
are
dentists?
why
is
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
they're
dental
health
care
workers.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
rather
an
important
qualifier,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can
say
that,
but
is
it
true?
yes.
i
keep
saying,
why
is
the
moral
condition
equal
to
the
physical
condition?
why
is
that
so?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see...
i
don't
think--
--is
that
right?
are
there
laws
against
it?
i
mean...
i
mean,
i
can
understand
that
if
we
quarantine
everybody
with
tuberculosis.
then
it's
not
a
moral
choice.
and
then
you're
compelled.
but
you
think
it's
not
a
moral
choice
if
someone...
i
mean,
let's
say
i
have
a
very
contagious
cold.
and
i
decide,
you
know,
not
to...
not
to
go
on
an
airplane.
is...
is
that
a
moral
choice?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
it
be
a
disability
under
the
act
if...
if
i
know
that...
that
there
is
in
my
family
a
gene
that
causes
manic
depression,
and...
and
i
choose,
therefore,
not
to
have
children?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
a
disability
under
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
thought
it
was
an
issue
in
this
case.
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
different?
i
don't
understand
that.
are
you
disabled
under
the
act
if
you
know
if
you
get
out
of
the
house
you'll
give
the
whole
city
bubonic
plague?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
not
enable
you
to
say
there
has
never
been
a
case.
you...
you
say
there
has
not
been
a
documented
case.
what
does
documentation
require?
justice
antonin
scalia
according
to
cdc,
requires
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
immediately
afterwards,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
are
a
lot
of
conditions
that...
that...
that
may
not
have
been
followed
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
statute
doesn't
say
anything
about
the
cdc.
he
can...
he
can
put
in
his
own
expert
witnesses
on
this,
just
as
on
any
issue,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
cdc...
i
mean,
that's
very
nice,
but--
--why
should...
why
should...
why
do
we
defer
to
the
cdc?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
just
like
the
criminal
law.
yes.
can
we
tell
the
attorney
general
to
interpret
the
criminal
statutes,
issue
regulations
as
to
what
the
criminal
statutes
mean?
i
have
not
thought
that
that's
the
kind
of
administration
of
the
law
that
we
talk
about
when
we
accord
chevron
deference
to
agencies.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
it,
but
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace--
--it
includes
a
mental
impairment,
too,
doesn't
it,
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
would...
would
you...
would
you
regard
a
firm
homosexual
sexual
orientation
as
being
a
disability
under
the
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
excluded
where?
do
you
know
the
provision?
i
mean,
in...
in...
in
the
regulations
or
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can
have
cancer.
you...
you
could
have
ovarian
cancer.
that
would
be
an
impairment
of
the...
of
the
reproductive
system,
which
could
cause
a
disability.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
necessarily
a
disability
associated
just
with
reproduction.
i...
i
understood
the
regulations
went
through
all
the
major
physical
functions
of
the
body,
or
physical
whatever
doctors
call
them,
including
the
reproductive
system,
the
breathing
system
and
so
forth.
isn't
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
have
a
problem
with
whether
it's
an
impairment.
we
have...
i
have
a
problem
with
your
saying
since
reproductive
disease
is
an
impairment,
the...
affecting
the
ability
to
reproduce
is
a
disability,
in
that
automatically
the
ability
to
reproduce
is
a
major
life
activity.
i
don't
understand
that
leap.
just
because
they
mention
the
reproductive
system
along
with
all
the
other
organs
of
the
body.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
introduce
expert
testimony
at
the
trial?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
your
own?
