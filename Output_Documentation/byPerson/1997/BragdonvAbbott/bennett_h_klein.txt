mr.
bennett
h.
klein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
problem
of
discrimination
against
individuals
with
hiv
was
squarely
before
congress
when
it
enacted
the
ada.
and
the
committee
reports
reflect
a
concern
that
unless
there
were
clear
protections
against
discrimination
for
all
individuals
with
hiv,
people
with
hiv
would
hide
their
condition.
as
the
first
circuit
correctly
found,
sidney
abbott,
a
woman
infected
with
the
virus
that
causes
aids
has
a
disability
within
the
meaning
of
the
ada.
and
this
court
can
affirm
the
first
circuit's
decision
on
three
alternative
grounds.
first
of
all,
this
court
can
affirm
the
first
circuit
if
it
finds
that
reproduction
is
a
major
life
activity.
in
addition,
the
court
can
affirm
the
first
circuit
if
it
finds,
as
reflected
in
the
committee
reports
and
as
the
first
circuit
also
noted
in
its
decision,
that
everybody
with
hiv,
a
fatal,
contagious,
incurable
disease,
is
substantially
limited
in
many
different
major
life
activities.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
it's
not
the
same
as
the
statute,
and
i
think
that
what
is
noted
in
the
committee
reports,
which
is
the
people
with
hiv
are
limited
in
major
life
activities,
is
consistent
with
the
plain
meaning
of
the...
the
phrase
that
congress
did
choose.
which
was
substantially
limited
in
one
or
more
major
life
activities.
as
an
incurable,
fatal
and
contagious
disease,
people
with
hiv
cannot
engage
in
procreation
or
intimate
sexual
relations.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
yes.
and
i'd
like
to
address
both
under
the...
the
meaning
of
the
term
"substantial
limitation"
and
also
the
regulation
that
you
quoted
from.
the...
the
term
"substantial
limitation",
by
its
plain
meaning,
doesn't
mean
that
somebody
is
precluded
from
engaging
in
the
activity,
or
even
chooses
not
to
engage
in
the
activity.
"substantially
limited"
cannot
have
that
meaning.
indeed,
somebody
couldn't
be...
ever
be
substantially
limited
in
the
major
life
activity
of
breathing
if
one
had
to
be
precluded
from
engaging
in
that
activity.
now,
the
regulations,
which
you
quoted,
indicate
that
a
person
cannot
engage
in
the
activity
or
cannot
perform
the
activity
under
the
same
conditions
or
manner
or
even
duration
as
somebody
who
does
not
have
that
impairment,
or
the
average
member
of
the
population.
a
person
with
hiv--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--well,
the...
the
limitation
flows
from
the
physical
impairment
of
hiv.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
well,
i
think
that
a
person
is
limited...
a
person
cannot
perform
an
activity
under
the
same
conditions
as
somebody
without
the
impairment
if...
if,
for
example,
they
can
transmit
a
deadly
disease
to
a
sexual
partner,
if
they
can
infect
their
child,
and
also
because--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--because
it
all
flows
from
the
inevitable
fact
of
the
contagiousness
of
h...
not
only
the
contagiousness
of
hiv,
but
the
fatality
of
hiv.
for
example,
reproduction
is
not
simply
the
act
of
conception.
it...
procreation
and
reproduction
also
involve
raising
and
nurturing
a
child.
as
a
fatal
disease--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--well,
i
think
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute
does
not...
does
not
preclude
the
re...
does
not
require
a
preclusion
of
the
activity.
in
other
words,
just
the
phrase
"a
physical
or
mental
impairment
that
substantially
limits
a
major
life
activity,
but
for
that
impairment.
"
--but
for
the
existence
of
hiv,
reproduction
and
procreation
and
the
choices
and
decisions
that
people
have
to
make
around
it
would
be
very
different.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
that's
correct.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
well,
i
don't
think
that
the
key
choice
is
a
moral
choice.
i
think
the
limitation
flows
from
the
physical
impairment.
and
as
the
first
circuit
noted--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--i
don't
believe...
i'm
not
sure
i
under--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--the...
i
don't
think
the
fact
that
there's
a
volitional
aspect
to
a
limitation
precludes
it
from
being
a
substantial
limitation
under
the
statute.
many--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--well--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--i
think
that's
a
very
separate
and
complex
question
that's
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
because
the
court
would
have
to
reach
the
question
there--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--the...
well,
i
think...
i
think
that
is
somewhat...
somewhat
distinct,
justice
scalia.
because
the
court
would
have
to
reach
the
issue
there
of
whether
a
genetic
condition
is
an
impairment.
and
that
depends
on
a
scientific
understanding
of...
of
the
effects
of
that
genetic
disorder.
in
other
words--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--i
would
certainly
think
so,
yes.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
there
is
no
documented
case
of
a
dental
practitioner
who
has
been
infected
with
hiv.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
no.
there
is
no
dental
health
care
worker.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
that's
right.
right.
to
make
it
crystal
clear,
there
has
never
been
a
case
of
occupational
transmission
of
hiv
from
a
patient
to
a
dentist.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
those
are
cases
that
the
cdc
has
investigated
and
concluded
that
there's
not
sufficient
evidence
to
determine
occupational
transmission.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
as
of
1994
and
as
of
today.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
well,
documentation
requires--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--requires
that
there
be
an
initial
injury
and
that
the
person
then
have
a
baseline
hiv
test
so
we
know--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--that's
correct.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
okay.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
well,
we...
we
don't...
all
we
know
is
what...
what
current
medical
knowledge
can
tell
us.
the
regulation
requires
that
we...
we
base
direct
threat
on
a
determination
of
current
medical
knowledge.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
it...
it
can't
tell
us
that.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
but
we...
what
we
know
is
that
we
have
no
known
case.
and,
you
know,
there's
been
over
a
billion
dental
procedures.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
i'm
sorry?
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
because
there's
no...
no
documentation
of
hiv
status
arising
from
the
occupational
injury.
and
as...
as
there
is
testimony--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--what
was
not
documented
was
that
the
causation
of...
of
hiv
transmission
was
through
an
occupational
means.
the
cdc
determined
that
there
is
not
valid
scientific
evidence
to
know
that...
that
hiv
transmission
occurred
through
the
dentist's
occupational
duties.
there
are
many
other
modes
of
hiv
transmission.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
well,
the...
the
regulation
requires
that
the
determination
be
consistent
with
current
medical
knowledge.
and
certainly
there
is
no
known
case
of
this
happening.
the
cdc's
position
is
that...
is
that
they
have
instructed
dentists
how
to
perform
procedures
safely.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
yes,
he--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--well,
for
two
reasons.
first
of
all,
this
court,
in
arline,
indicated
that
when
we're
trying
to
determine
whether...
whether
the
risk
of
transmission
of
a
contagious
disease
can
be
the
basis
for
its
prevention--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--no,
i
don't
believe
it
was
dicta.
but
right
after...
right
after
arline
was
decided,
the
congress,
a
few
years
later,
passed
the
ada,
adopting
the
same
kind
of
direct
threat
test.
and
in
section
12201,
referred
back
to...
to
standards
under
the
rehabilitation
act,
which
was
arline.
and
deference
to
the
health
care
provider
is
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
because
the
statute
covers
health
care
providers
as
places
of
public
accommodation.
and...
and
congress
found,
in
12101,
that
there
was
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
disability
in
health
services--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--we
argued
in
the
district
court
that
hiv
is
a
disability,
and
specifically
that
sidney
abbott
was
an
example
of
that,
through
the
limitation
on
her--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--the
plaintiff
did
not
present
specific
testimony
and
did
not
rely
for
her
individualized
planning
of
disability
on
any
activity
other
than
reproduction.
but
we
certainly
argued
in
the
district
court
that
hiv
is
always
a
disability.
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
well,
i
think
in
the
section
of
our
brief
talking
about
the
plain
meaning
of
the
terms
"substantial
limitation
of
a
major
life
activity.
"
and
in
the
legislation
history,
which
indicates
that
the
committees
considered
that
hiv
was
always
a
disability,
not
only
because
it
harmed...
discrimination
harmed
individuals,
but
because
there
was
a
grave
concern
about
the
public
health
consequences,
that
if
people
could
not
be
assured
of
nondiscrimination...
and
we
had
to
rely
on
somebody's
intentions
about
reproduction
or
sexual
activity
today,
tomorrow
or
yesterday,
that--
mr.
bennett
h.
klein
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
