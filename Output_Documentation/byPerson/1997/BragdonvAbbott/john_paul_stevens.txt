justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
the
regulation...
i'm
a
little
puzzled.
you
want
us
to
ignore
the
regulations
that
are
issued
by
the
department
of
justice
pursuant
to
this
statute
and
look
at
some
other
regulations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
regulations
specifically
list
hiv
as
a
physical
or
mental
impairment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
regulation,
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
it's
moral
or
not?
that's
what
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
tell
me
again
why
it
is
that
we
should
not
give
any
weight
to
these
seven
cases?
what...
would
you
say
that--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--why...
why
are
the
seven
cases
that
he
relies
on
not
relevant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
is
it
a
question
of
causation
that
wasn't
proved
or
that
the...
there
was
in
fact
no...
no
disease
to
the
dental
worker?
i
still
am
not
quite
clear
why
they're
totally
irrelevant.
what
was
not
documented?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
have
no
trouble
with
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
wallace,
may
i
ask...
the...
the
provision
directing
the
attorney
general
to...
to
promulgate
regulations
says
that
they
shall
include
standards
applicable
to
facilities
and
vehicles
covered
under
section
12182
of
this
title.
what
is
that
section,
12182?
what
are
the...
the
facilities
and
vehicles?
