justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
concede
there
is
a
physical
impairment,
or
don't
you?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
really
a
pretty
skimpy
record
on
that
point.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you
say
that
we
have
to
focus
on
daily
public
and
economic
life
activities,
as
oppose
to
the
more
private
activities
that
are
the...
really
the
basis
for
the
respondent's
contention?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
you
stipulate
that
3
or
4
years
hence
it
is
highly
likely
that
major
life
activities
of
the
kind
you've
been
discussing
will
be
affected,
is
the
person
disabled,
have
disability
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
in
the
first
year,
when
we
know
that
it's
inevitable
that
there
will
be
an
effect
3
or
4
years
down
the
line?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let's
assume
that
it's--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
relevant
date,
i
take
it,
is
1994,
when
the
discrimination
took
place?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do...
do
you
concede
that
it's
strictly
a
moral
limitation
or
a
moral
mandate
that
you're
client
followed?
i...
i
suppose
a
person
with
tuberculosis,
which
i
assume
can
be
very
infectious
and
contagious,
stays
away
from
other
people
and
we
don't
just
call
that
a...
a
moral
choice.
it
is
an
objective
limitation
on
that
person's
ability
to
interact
with
other
people
in
society.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
the
question
is
whether
or
not
it
was
reasonable
for
the
dentist,
in
1994,
to
assume
that
there
was
a
significant
risk.
i'm
not
sure
that
he
is...
is
bound
by
exactly
what
the
cdc
determines,
especially
at
some
later
date.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what...
what
is
the
best
authority
in
the
record
or
in
the
brief
to
sustain
that
position,
that
it's
a
disability
on
a
major...
or
it
impairs
a
major
life
function,
other
than
reproduction?
where
would
i
look
if
i
wanted
to
find
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
that
the
only
basis?
can't
we
find
from
the
briefs
that
there
are
other
impacts
on
major
life
activities,
other
than
reproduction?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
let
me
ask...
let
me
ask
one
other
question.
suppose
the
dentist
has
aids,
not
the
patient.
would
it
be
discriminatory
for
an
hmo
with
more
than
15
people
to
refuse
to
hire
the
dentist
or,
alternatively,
to
require
that
the
dentist
disclose
this
to
the
patients?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
does
it
raise
different
issues
if
the...
if
the
chance
is
infection
because
of
the
close
proximity
between
the
dentist
and
the
patient?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
it
would
seem
to
me
the
answer
to
the
question
is
that
this
doesn't
have
to
be
disclosed
and
the...
and
the
dentist
has
to
be
hired.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
suppose
there
were
a
policy
by
the
hmo
that
the...
the
person
has
to
disclose
to
the
patient
so
the
patient
has
a
choice.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let's
assume
that
that
would
be
a
discrimination
under
the
act.
