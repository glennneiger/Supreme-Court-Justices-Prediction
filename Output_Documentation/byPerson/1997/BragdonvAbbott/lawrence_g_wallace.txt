mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
not
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is,
in
42
u.s.c.,
section
12188,
a
provision
entitled
"enforcement".
and
subsection
b
of
that
section
12188
is
entitled
"enforcement
by
attorney
general".
and
it
gives
in
its
subparts
a
duty
to
investigate
possible
violations
of
the
public
accommodations
provision
and
authority
to
bring
lawsuits.
and,
indeed,
this
is
very
important
authority,
because
only
the
attorney
general
can
bring
a
suit
for
compensatory
damages.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
then...
and
then,
section
12186
of
title
42
explicitly
imposes
a
duty
on
the
attorney
general
to
adopt
regulations
to
implement
title
iii.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
should
think
so.
yes.
and
there
is
a
further...
and
there
is
a
further
provision
here
that
is
of...
of
direct
relevance.
and
that
is
section
12201,
subsection
a
of
title
42,
which
says
"except
as
otherwise
provided
in
this
chapter,
nothing
in
this
chapter
shall
be
construed
to
apply
a
lesser
standard
than
the
standards
applied
under
title
v
of
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973
or
the
regulations
issued
by
federal
agencies
pursuant
to
such
title.
"
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and...
and
many
of
the
regulations
were
carried
forward
verbatim
from
the
hhs
regulations
that
congress
was
referring
to
in
this
provision.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
let
me
look
and
see.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that...
that
is
a...
it's
entitled
"prohibition
of
discrimination
by
public
accommodations.
"
and
it's...
it's
in
the...
it's
in
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--all
right.
well,
i'm
sorry.
i
would
have
to...
but...
but
that...
that
is
the
general
prohibition
of
discrimination
in
the
furnishing
of
public
accommodations.
and
public
accommodations
or
elsewhere
defined
to
include
these
health
facilities.
now,
one
of
the
regulations
that
has
been
carried
over
verbatim,
as
we
were
talking
about,
from
the
previous
regulations,
and
one
that
was
very
much
before
congress
because
it
was
quoted,
set
out
in
this
court's
opinion
in
the
arline
case,
is
the
definition
of
physical
impairment,
to
include
any
physiological
disorder
or
condition
affecting
the
hemic
or
lymphatic
systems.
and
that
of
course
includes
hiv
infection,
as
the
current
regulations
specifically
state
it
does.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
specifically
excluded
in
another
provision.
and
that
is
pointed
out
in
an
amicus
brief
filed
by
senators
harkin,
et
al.,
who
were
sponsors
and
floor
managers
of
the
legislation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in...
in
the
statute
itself.
and
there
is
the
point
made
that...
in...
it's
section
12211,
i
am
told--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in...
in
order
to
be
a
disability,
it
must
substantially
limit
a
major
life
activity.
so
there
are
two
further
questions
once
it...
it
is
determined
that
it
is
a
physical
impairment.
one
is
whether
it
affects
a
major
life
activity
and
whether...
and
the
second
is
whether
it
substantially
limits
that
major
life
activity.
the
major
life
activity
which
was
the
focus
of
this
case
and
on
which
both
courts
below
relied
was
reproduction
and
impairment
to
the
reproductive
capacity.
that,
in
the
very
same
regulation
that
i
quoted,
is
really
implicit
in
that
regulation.
since
impairment
is
defined
as
a
disorder
or
condition
that,
among
other
things,
affects
the
reproductive
system,
it
is
hard
to
see
how
that
would
have
any
relevance
unless
reproduction
were
a
major
life
activity,
a
substantial
limitation
of
which
could
be
a
disability
under
the
act.
because
it's
hard
to
see
how
impairment
of
the
reproductive
system
would
relate
to
any
other
major
life
activity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it...
it...
it's--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--and
the...
and
i
might
add
that
the
current
regulations
also
refer
to
hiv
disease
specifically
as
an
impairment.
and
the...
the
list--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--all
right.
all
right.
well,
that
is
just
one
indication,
perhaps
not
a
conclusive
indication,
but
it
certainly
looks
in
the
direction
of
concern
about
impairment
to
the
reproductive
system.
now,
the
court
of
appeals
approached
this
question
in
what
we
believe
was
an
exemplary
fashion.
the
act
does
not
itself
define
what
is
a
major
life
activity.
and
so
the
court
of
appeals
said
we'll
think
of
the
ordinary
meaning
of
"major",
which
is
significant
in
comparison
with
other
activities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
although
a
remand
might
be
in
order.
what...
there
is
protection,
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
and
as
the
court
relied
on
quite
strongly
in
the
arline
case,
for
individuals
who
are
regarded
as
having
an
impairment
that
affects
a
major
life
activity.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
would
say
that
is
best
documented
in
two
of
the
amicus
briefs,
the
one
filed
by
the
american
medical
association,
which
spends
quite
a
few
pages
describing
hiv--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
as
well
as
the
brief
of
senator
harkin,
et
al.
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the
last
footnote
in
our
brief
points
out
that
the...
the
question
of
hiv
infection
in
health
care
workers
and
whether
they
are
otherwise
qualified
really
raises
different
issues.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
it's
the
health
care
worker
that's
in
charge
and
control
of
whether
the
precautions
are
taken
or
not,
the
patient
will
be
subjected
to
risks
over
which
the
patient
has
no
control.
but
if
the
health
care
worker
follows
the
universal
procedures
that
have
been
recommended
by
the
centers
for
disease
control
and
the
dental
association
and
the
medical
association
and
other
professional
groups,
the
health
care
worker
can
limit
any
possible
risk--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the...
the
question
of
disclosure
really
is
not
addressed
by
this
act.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's...
there's
nothing
in
the
act
that
i'm
aware
of
that
addresses
that
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it's
very
close
to
the
question
that
the
court
had
in
arline,
in
which
you
tried
to
specify
some
standards
to
be
used
to
be
sure
that
there
was
meaningful
protection
afforded
to
what
were
handicapped
individuals
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
and
that
only
real,
rather
than
conjectural,
risks
of
the
kind
found
here
by
the
court
of
appeals,
after
a
very
careful
review
of
the
evidence,
would
be
used
to
hold
the
person
unqualified
for
protection,
because
the
act
is
an
anti
discrimination
act,
which
could
be
undermined
if
each
person
can
choose
for
himself
whether
to
discriminate.
now,
i
do
say...
want
to
say
that
implicit
in
the
findings
is
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in...
in...
in
the
findings
of
why
it
was
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals.
that
the
reason...
and...
and
this
is
petitioner's
own
contention...
the
reason
that
dr.
bragdon
refused
ordinary
dental
treatment
to
the
respondent
here
was
because
of
his
fear
of
possible
contagion
from
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
was...
summary
judgment
was
granted.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
for
the
respondent.
and
that
was
upheld
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
it's
a
factual
dispute
that
can
survive
summary
judgment.
