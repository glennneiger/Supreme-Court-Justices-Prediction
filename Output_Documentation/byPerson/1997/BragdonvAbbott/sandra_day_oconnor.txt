i
thought
it
was
curious
that
the
american
medical
association
took
the
position
that
it
is
a
physical
impairment
under
the
act
from
the
beginning,
and
the
dental
association,
on
the
other
hand,
takes
the
opposite
view.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
act
seems
to
go
further,
and
say
if
someone
is
regarded
as
having
the
impairment
it's
covered.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
this
case
arose
in
'92,
'93?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
'94.
have
the...
has
our
knowledge
about
the
risks
changed
since
that
time?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
look
at
it
as
of
that
date,
and
how
has
our
information
changed
since
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
klein,
may
i
ask
you
whether
the
plaintiff
below
relied
on
any
impairment
of
a
major
life
activity
other
than
reproduction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
could
you
answer
the
question
that
i
asked,
which
was
whether
the
plaintiff
relied
on
any
other
activity
other
than
reproduction?
