mr.
mccarthy,
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
at
the
outset
whether
you
recognize
that
once
the
symptoms
are
visible,
what
is
now
described
as
aids,
once
a
person
has
that
disease,
that
that
would
constitute
a
disability?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
contending
that
a
rational
congress
would
draw
the
line
and
exclude
from
this
protection
a
person
whose
symptoms
are
not
yet
visible,
yet
include
someone
who
would
pose
perhaps
at
least
equal
danger
whose
symptoms
are
visible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
sustaining
oneself,
the
words
you
just
used,
including
access
to
ordinary
health
care
like
going
to
the
dentist?
this...
a
person
who
has
the
hiv
virus,
would
you
agree,
needs
to
be
checked
more
regularly
than
you
or
i,
needs
access
to
medical
monitoring?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
access
is
rendered
more
difficult,
as
this
very
case
shows.
that
person
needs
the
monitoring,
and
is
impeded
from
getting
it.
why
doesn't
that
qualify?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
seven
cases
that
the
other
side
has
mentioned,
of
dental
health
care
workers?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
while
that
is
on
the
burner,
may
i
ask...
as
i
understand
it,
there's
no
dispute
here
that
hiv
is
a
physical
impairment.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
so
the
only
question
is
whether
it's
a
disability.
and
those
two
questions
shouldn't
be
confused.
so
we're
talking
about
is
it
a
disability,
given
that
it
is
a
physical
impairment?
and
there
are
some
physical
impairments
that
are
not
disabilities.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
if
we
don't
accept
your
view
that
reproduction
is
this
major
life
activity,
if
we
don't
accept
that,
do...
do
you
lose?
