chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
97-156,
randon
bragdon
v.
sidney
abbott.
mr.
mccarthy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
issue
argued
in
the
first
circuit,
the
regarded
as?
was
that
point
argued
in
the
first
circuit,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--had
it
been
raised
in
the
district
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
something
in
the
record
that
indicates
that
someone
in
the
position
of
ms
abbott
would
have
to
go
to
the
dentist
more
regularly
than
someone
without
that
condition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccarthy.
mr.
klein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
klein,
you
say
as
noted
in
the
committee
reports.
that
isn't
the
same
as
the
statute,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
pretty
much
dicta
in
arline,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
wallace,
while
you're
coming
up,
will
you
tell
me
why
the
justice
department
regulations
make
any
difference?
i
mean,
i
used
to
be
in
the
justice
department
and
i
used
to
write
opinions
on
behalf
of
the
attorney
general.
and
it
would
have
been
very
nice
if
the
congress
had
said,
you
know,
whatever
scalia
says
the
statute
means,
it
means.
[laughter]
i...
i
didn't
think
they
could
do
that.
and...
and
this
statute
is...
it...
am
i
correct?
it
gives
no
responsibilities
to
the
justice
department
except
to
issue
interpretive
regulations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wallace,
supposing
we
have
a
standard
criminal
law
statute,
like
carrying
a
gun
in
connection
with
a
drug
felony.
and
congress,
as
a
part
of
that
statute,
says
and
the
attorney
general
shall
issue
regulations
telling
what
these
section...
sections
mean.
now,
do
you
think
we
would
give
deference
to
those
regulations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
follow
it
with
the
clerk
later?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
amicus
briefs
can't
raise
issues
that
are
not
raised
by
the
parties,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what...
what
findings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
who
made
the
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
this
case
wasn't
tried
to
a
jury
in
the
district
court,
it
was
tried
in
the
court
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--summary
judgment
for
whom?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
there's
any
factual
dispute,
that's
wrong?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
mccarthy,
you
have
3
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccarthy.
the
case
is
submitted.
