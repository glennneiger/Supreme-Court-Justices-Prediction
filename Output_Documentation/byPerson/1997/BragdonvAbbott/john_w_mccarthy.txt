mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
some
risks
are
acceptable.
we
know
when
we
build
a
major
bridge
or
a
tunnel
that
there
are
risks
of
death
during
the
course
of
construction,
despite
reasonable
precautions,
but
these
risks
are
acceptable
because
there
are
benefits
to
society
and
because
the
workers
are
not
compelled
to
participate.
ms.
abbott
and
her
supporters
believe
the
risk
to
the
lives
of
dentists
is
outweighed
by
providing
inoffice
treatment
to
hiv
positive
patients
without
additional
precautions.
dr.
bragdon
believes
that
when
he
provides
service
in
the
face
of
the
risk
of
death,
he
should
be
allowed
to
take
additional
precautions.
this
raises
one
of
the
fundamental
questions
in
this
case.
what
is
the
proper
legal
standard
for
determining
when
to
impose
liability
on
a
dentist
facing
a
claim
of
discrimination
under
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
when
the
direct
threat
provisions
are
implemented?
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i
think
that's
very
likely,
your
honor,
but
our
position
is
that
the
definition
applies
for
disability,
and
the
definition
is
when
there's
a
physical
or
mental
impairment
and
here
we're
talking
about
hiv,
that
substantial
limits
a
major
life
activity,
if
that
comes
into
play,
then
the
person's
disabled,
then
it
seems
very
likely
it
would
come
into
play
if
a
person
had
visible
symptoms
of
hiv
disease.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i
don't...
we
don't
concede
that,
although
we
see
the
force
of
the
respondents'
argument
on
that
issue.
we
note
that
the
fourth
circuit
in
runnebaum
found
that
there
was
no
physical
impairment
and
we're
unwilling
to
concede
that
issue
when
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
made
that
finding.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
position
the
dental
association
takes
with
regard
to
physical
impairment.
we
don't
think
that
it's
really
essential
to
the
arguments
that
we
are
making
in
this
matter.
our
arguments
are
directed
to
disability
and...
rather
than
a
physical
impairment.
there
was,
it
appears
to
us,
a
great
deal
of
confusion
about
those
terms
in
congress,
where
congressmen
and
women
sometimes
didn't
seem
to
understand
the
difference
between
impairment
and
disability.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i
think
that
the
language
of
the
act
says,
if
someone
is
regarded
as
having
such
impairment,
and
when
they
say
such
impairment
they're
referring
to
an
impairment
that
substantially
limits
a
major
life
activity,
so
the
regarded
as
only
comes
into
play
if
you
have
an
impairment
that
substantially
limits
a
major
life
activity.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
in
our
view
it
wasn't
really
argued
aggressively,
but
the
issue
has
appeared.
the
solicitor
general,
or
the
department
of
justice
raised
it
in
the
first
circuit.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i
believe
the
respondent
believes
that
it
has,
and
the
record
is
somewhat
ambiguous
on
that.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
there's
a
very
skimpy
record
on
that
issue.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
no.
we
do
not
think
that
congress
excluded
individuals
with
hiv
disease.
we
think
that
congress
defined
disability,
and
you
have
to
meet
it.
whether
you
are
symptomatic
or
not
symptomatic,
you
have
to
have
a
physical
impairment
that
substantially
limits
a
major
life
activity,
and
our
argument
goes
directly
to
the
statute,
and
there
are
certainly...
although
there
may
have
been
efforts
to
pass
legislation
that
excluded
contagious
diseases,
they
were
not
successful,
and
we
certainly
don't
take
that
position.
we
take
the
position
that
you
have
to
meet
the
definition,
and
the
reason
the
issue
is
raised
in
a
case
like
this
is
because
this
particular
individual
is
a
classic
example
of
a
person
who
had
no
symptoms,
no
difficulties
whatsoever.
the
record
is
very
clear
on
that,
that
she
doesn't
have
any
of
the
sorts
of
attributes
that
are
attributed
to
some
asymptomatic
and
certainly
some
symptomatic
hiv
individuals.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
we
get
to
that
language
when
we
look
at
reproduction
as
a
major
life
activity,
and
there
are
sort
of
two
parts
of
that,
and
the
first
part
is,
well,
this...
how
do
you
get
away
from
the
idea
that
it's
so
major...
obviously
reproduction
is
so
major,
it
must
be
a
major
life
activity.
and
we
escape
from
that
argument,
we
believe
successfully,
by
the
fact
that
congress
already
narrowed
that
definition
to
what's
in
the
regulation,
and
i
say
congress
narrowed
it
to
what's
in
the
regulation
because
they
adopted
the
language,
major
life
activities,
from
the
1973
act,
the
rehabilitation
act,
and
the
1988
fair
housing
amendments
act,
so
it
was
already
in
place
that
major
life
activities
is
limited
to
functions
such
as
living,
breathing,
working.
when
we
get
to
that,
the
question
then
becomes
is
reproduction
on
that
list
of
major
life
activities,
and
the
reason
it
isn't
is
precisely
for
the
reason
i
think
you
made
inquiry
with
respect
to,
your
honor,
and
that
is,
you
have
to
look
at
the
context
and
purposes
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act
in
order
to
determine
what
goes
on
that
list,
and
the
context
and
purposes
are,
day
to
day
independent
living
and
economic
self
sufficiency.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
we're...
i'm
making
reference
to
the
department
of
justice
title
iii
regulations,
but
it's
also
important
to
make
reference
in
the
sense
that
i
just
described
to
the
regulations
that
issued
under
the
rehabilitation
act
and
the
fair
housing
amendments
act.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
they
are
either
identical
or
essentially
identical
in
that
regard.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i'm
not
sure
exactly
what
you
mean.
they
issued
the
regulations--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--under
title
iii.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i'm
not
aware
of
the
department
of
justice--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--it
certainly
was
unusual,
and
we
don't...
and
we
don't
really
rely
on
it
in
that
sense.
our
reliance
comes
upon...
comes
out
of
the
fact
that
the...
that
congress
knew
when
it
accepted
the
term,
major
life
activities,
that
major
life
activities
was
already
under
a
term
under
the
rehabilitation
act
that
had
already
had
an
existing
regulation,
so
it
incorporated
that,
and
there
are
two...
i
think
you're
making
a
distinction
that's
worth
noting,
if
i
understand
it
correctly.
there
are
two
different
ways
they
look
at
that,
and
one
is
simply
knowing
that
that
language
already
existed,
and
the
other
is
attempting
to
say
through
the
senate
and
committee
reports
that
they
were
adopting
that
language,
and
those
are
two
different
ways
of
looking
at--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--they
attempted
to
say
it
through
the
committee
reports.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
oh,
no,
certainly
the
whole
congress
did
not,
but
the
committee
reports
made
that
argument.
we're
not
suggesting
that
those
committee
reports
are
significant.
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
an
answer
to
the
question
of
what
role
does
independent...
day
to
day
independent
living
and
economic
self
sufficiency
play
in
defining
what
is
and
what
is
not
a
major
life
activity,
and
we
think
we've
in
a
sense
solved
the
riddle
to
how
do
you
determine
what
goes
on
that
list,
and
the
riddle
and
answer
is,
you
have
this
principle
basis
now
for
deciding
what
should
be
on
the
list,
and
that
is
these
goals
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act.
once
you
have
those
goals
in
mind
and
have
this
principal
basis,
you
then
say
a
major
life
activity
is
a
activity
which,
if
substantially
limited
by
a
physical
or
a
mental
impairment,
interferes
with
the
ability
to
achieve
day
to
day
independent
living
and
economic
self
sufficiency,
and
when
you
apply
that
test
you'll
find
reproduction
doesn't
fit
that
list
in
whatever
fashion
we
describe
as
reproduction,
but
learning,
hearing,
working,
breathing
do.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
well,
of
course,
in
a
sense
it...
we
think
of
it
as
inevitable,
but
recent--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--but
if
we
assume
it's
inevitable
the
definition
of
disability
certainly
does
not
seem
to
attempt
to
affect
future
disabilities,
which
is
the
question
that
that
raises.
in
fact,
i
believe
the
eeoc
guidelines
for
title
i
specifically
say
they're
not
addressing...
and
now
i
can't
remember
the
term...
gene
based
disabilities,
or
disabilities
that
are
going
to
occur
in
the
future
in
that
sense,
and
the
argument
that
because
you
know,
almost
know
for
sure
you're
going
to
have
disabilities
later
on,
you
should
be
classified
as
disabilities
now,
i
think
simply
goes
beyond
the
statute.
the
statute
not
only
defines
disabilities
in
a
present
sense,
but
if
you
open
up
the
statute
to
future
disabilities,
then
you
start
looking
at
hypertension,
genetic
problems,
huntington's
chorea
disease,
whatever
might
exist
in
the
future.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i'm
having
a
little
bit
of
difficulty
adjusting
to
a--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--i
think
it's
entirely
possible
that
eating
is
a
major
life--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--but
that
argument
escapes
from
the
idea
that
the
term
major
life
activities
incorporates
a
definition
that's
already
bounded
by
the
regulation.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
no.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
the
regulation
says,
such
as,
so
it's
not
excluded.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
but
now--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--because
the
test
is
not
important.
the
test
is,
is
it...
does
it
fit
within
the
terms
of
this
regulation,
which
is
such
as
eating,
breathing,
learning,
and--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--no.
the
regulation
that
i'm
referring
to
that
gives
meaning
to
major
life
activities
is
part
of
this
statute.
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
these
same
regulations--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--and
it
almost
certainly
is
a
physical
or
mental
impairment,
but
a
physical
or
mental
impairment
is
different
than
a
disability,
and
we
know
that
it's
classified,
probably
classified
as
a
physical
impairment,
certainly
if
you
follow
the
regulations,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
a
disability,
and
we
get
to...
in
order
for
it
to
be
a
disability,
it
has
to
be
a
physical
impairment
that
substantially
limits
a
major
life
activity.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
that's
right.
they
are...
in
other--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--in
a
sense.
they
go
to
sustaining
oneself,
and
reproduction
is
outside
that...
doesn't
fit
with
the
list.
i
mean
the...
sort
of
the
game
here
are
the...
and
of
course
that's
a
loose
way
of
referring
to
it,
but
the
whole
idea
here
is,
we're
given
this
regulation
that
says
what
major
life
activities
are,
and
it
defines
it
in
terms
of
examples,
and
one
must
understand
why
the
examples
are
there
to
know
what
else
goes
on
the
list.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i
think
it's
arguable
that
if
a
person
has
a
serious
disease
and
the
present
medical
regimen
would
include
more
visits
to
the
office
than
perhaps
some...
not
i,
but
somebody
else
makes.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
well,
if
that
argument
is,
you're
substantially
limited
in
the
ability
to
care
for
yourself--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--because
you
have
to
go
to
the
doctor,
first
of
all...
or
a
dentist,
first
of
all
she's
not
substantially
limited.
that
part
of
the
definition
exists
also.
dr.
bragdon
didn't
prevent
her
from
obtaining
care.
in
fact,
he
offered
her
care,
and
there's
lots
of
other
care
available,
so
we
can't
mix
up
the
discrimination
and
the
disability
questions,
and
the
disability
question
is,
is
this
caring
for
oneself
come
under
that--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--there's
nothing
in
the
record
that
i'm
aware
of
that
would
suggest
dental
care
would
fit
under
that
rubric.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i
think
that's
correct,
that
the...
you
can't
get
at
what
is
a
disability
by
what
is
allegedly
discrimination,
but
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at
is,
we're
now
talking
about
reproduction
as
a...
we're
now
talking
about
caring
for
oneself
as
a
major
life
activity,
and
we
know
it
is
a
major
life
activity
because
it's
on
the
list,
and
the
ama
tries
to
put
health
care
services
under
that,
and
our
first
argument
is
it
really
doesn't
belong
there.
it's
not
caring
for
oneself,
but
we
haven't
even
discussed
that--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--but
the
part
that
i
was
getting...
attempting
to
get
at
was
there
is...
you're
not
substantially
limited
in
it
simply
because
a
single
dentist
says
to
you,
i
believe
we
should
take
additional
precautions
to
treat
you.
the
other
part
of
the
major
life
activity
argument
that
i
wanted
to
get
at
is
the
idea,
this
idea
of
the
principal
basis
in
day
to
day
independent
living
and
economic
self
sufficiency
being
the
guide.
the
reason
reproduction
doesn't
fit
within
that
group
is,
people
who
have
limitations
in
fertility,
or
impotent,
don't
normally
have
difficulties
with
day
to
day
independent
living
or
economic
self
sufficiency,
and
that's--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--ultimately
you
do,
yes.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
well,
if
we're
talking
about
hiv,
the
first
question
is,
is
it
an
impairment,
and
the
regulation
suggests
that
it
is
an
impairment,
and
when
we're
talking
about
whether
it
substantially
limits
a
major
life
activity,
like
being
impotent
or
like
being
infertile,
it
has
no
relationship
to
this
concept
of
day
to
day
independent
living.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
reproduction?
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
right.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i'm
afraid
i've
lost
that
distinction
as
we
discussed
now.
i
do
want
to
take
a
minute,
while
i
still
have
the
opportunity,
to
get
that--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--i
lost...
i'm
not
aware
of
the
distinction
as
i
stand
here.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
that's
correct,
arguably.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
those
are
being--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--those
are
the...
those
are
the
physical
impairments
that
relate
to
the
major
life
activity
of
reproduction.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
right.
having
hiv
doesn't
keep
her
from
having
a
child
or
from
reproducing.
she's
still
able
to
reproduce,
so
in
that
sense
hiv
is
different
than
being
infertile
or
being
impotent.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
yes.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
that's
correct.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
well,
there
are
two
parts
to
that
question,
and
first
of
all,
we
believe
that
assertion
by
the
respondent
is
simply
wrong.
the...
in
june
of
1994
the
cdc
reported
that
there
are
seven
hiv
infected
health
care
workers.
seven
with
known
occupational
injuries,
seven
with
known
hiv
exposures,
and
no
other
identifiable
source
of
hiv.
the
respondent
dismisses
these
seven
as--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--no,
these
are
seven
health
care
workers...
i
don't
know
if
they're
all
dentists.
certainly
at
least
some
of
them
are
dentists,
and
the
point
is
that
they
are
in
the
same
position
as
dentists
and
that
they
suffer
these--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--because
they're
all
dental
health
care
workers.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
yes.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
yes,
and--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--yes.
i'm
sorry
if
i--
[laughter]
if
i
said
health
care
workers,
i
misspoke.
they're
all
dental
health
care
workers,
and
the
cdc
labels
these
as
possible
because
it
uses
the
term
possible
to
mean
anything
that's
less
than
absolutely
certain,
but
when
you
look
at
the
way
the
cdc
treats
these,
they're
all
apparent
occupational
transmissions
that
occurred
in
the
dental
care
setting,
and
any
logical
analysis
under
our
way
of
looking
at
things
would...
by
ours,
i
mean
the
legal
system's,
would
include
these
were
more
likely
than
not
occurrences.
and
so--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--yes.
yes,
it
is,
and
the
point
is
that
the
term
documented
that's
used
by
respondent
and
others
here,
because
that's
a
cdc
term
that
refers
to
having
an
hi...
having
all
of
the
circumstances
we
just
described,
and
then
having
an
hiv
test
immediately
after
the
percutaneous
exposure
to
establish
that
you
don't
already
have
hiv,
that's
the
only
distinction.
and
the
studies
go
on
to
indicate
more
often,
much
more
often
than
not
there
is
no
such
hiv
test,
and
this
passive
surveillance
system
that
revealed
this
finding
is
by
the
cdc
itself
disclosed
to
be
as
much
as
90
percent
underreported.
it's
a
totally
passive
system.
there
are--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--yes.
september
16--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--yes.
september
16,
1994.
i
want
to
speak
for
just
a
minute,
if
i
can,
to
the
question
of
then
current
medical
knowledge.
assuming
we
get
to
the
appropriate
legal
standard,
which
is
good
faith
and
reasonable
judgment,
relying
on
the
objective
standard
of
then
current
medical
knowledge,
what
is
advanced
here
by
respondents
and
even
by
the
first
circuit
to
a
certain
extent
is
the
cdc,
as
if
it
were
a
public
health
authority
that
made
a
pronouncement
here,
and
this
is
truly
an
emperor
with
no
clothes.
the
cdc
has
issued
reports.
they
are
guidelines.
it
establishes
standards,
and
no
place
in
the
cdc
guidelines
does
it
indicate
that
there's
no
significant
risk.
in
fact,
it
specifically
recognizes
the
unique
nature
of
most
dental
procedures
also
may
require
specific
surgery...
strategies.
universal
precautions
are
minimum
guidelines
and
there's
no
reason
why
additional
precautions
shouldn't
be
taken,
and
that's
what
the
guidelines
say,
and
if
i
can
just
say
one
more
thing--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--september
16,
1994.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
i--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--the
standard
is
to
look
at
thencurrent
medical
knowledge,
and
i
think
that's
the
only
fair
way
to
determine
whether
or
not
you're
going
to
impose
civil
rights
liability.
that's
what's
suggested
by
the
amicus
brief
of
the
ama
here
and
in
arline,
where
they
cite
similar
cases
under
the
rehabilitation
act
of
1973,
and
the
point
is
that
then
current
medical
knowledge
is
the
only
way
to
judge
it.
i
don't
really
think
the
information
has
changed,
but
there's
one
significant
piece
of
evidence
here,
and
the
first
circuit
pointed
it
out,
and
that's
how
this
emperor
ended
up
having
no
clothes,
is
they
had
the
cdc
at
the
district
court
level,
through
a
witness
who
was
testifying,
a
litigation
witness
in
a
litigation
posture
from
the
cdc,
making
four
different
declarations
that
ultimately
say
something
like,
the
risk
is
safe
to
treat,
the
dentist
care
in
the...
in
this
setting,
and
the
point
is
you
don't
have
that
any
more.
you
just
have
the
cdc
guidelines
by
themselves,
and
that's
why
i
ask
you
to
look
at
the
cdc
guidelines,
because
they
don't
say
there's
no
risk.
i'd
like
to
reserve
my
time,
except
to
say
osha
has
very
much
similar
supportive
information
that's...
for
our
position
that's
noted
in
the
record.
thank
you.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
just
like
to
address
a
couple
of
issues.
one,
on
the
question
of
deferral,
in
this
case,
there
isn't
anything
to
defer
to
for
the
reasons
we
disclosed
before.
and
even
the
department
of
justice,
in
its
interpretive
guidelines,
indicates
that
when
you're
looking
to
public
authorities,
they
are
sources
of
information
that
include.
there's
no
suggestion
that
the
public
health
authorities
have
any
particular
power
here.
now,
there
very
well...
may
very
well
be
a
different
situation,
where
the
public
health
authorities
have
addressed
an
issue
directly
and
the
courts
would
have
reason
to
defer
to
them.
but
there
isn't
in
this
situation,
because
there
aren't
any
public
authorities
that
have
spoken
to
the
issue.
that
includes
the
american
dental
association,
which
isn't
a
public
health
authority,
but
gets
cited
as
if
it's
one.
it's
a...
it's
a
501(c)(6)
business
league,
and
it
made
a
policy
statement...
and
it
made
a
political
decision
about
what
it
recommends.
and
it
shouldn't
be
determinative
of
whether
or
not
an
individual
member
is
guilty
of
a
civil
rights
violation,
as
opposed
to
following
their
policy.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
yes,
we
did.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
right.
it
wasn't
at
trial,
but
introduced
it
in
response
to
the
motion
for
summary
judgment.
with
respect
to
the...
i
call
them
the
reverse
cases,
where
health
care
providers
have
brought
these
claims
of
violation
of
the
americans
with
disabilities
act,
and
have
lost
every
time.
it's
important
to
note,
i
believe,
that
it's
conceded
in
this
case
that
it's
easier
to
transmit
hiv
from
a
patient
to
a
doctor
than
it
is
from
a
doctor
to
a
patient.
and
there
are...
all
the
experts
on
both
sides
conceded
this.
dr.
molinari,
the
plaintiff's
expert,
wrote
an
article
on
it.
it's
at
fed.
app.
137a,
and
in
his
deposition
at
139a.
and
dr.
marianos,
the
cdc
expert,
made
the
same
concession
that
there
is
not
any
argument
about
that
particular
question.
the
plain...
the
respondents
have
raised
very
many
policy
issues
in
this
matter.
and
some
of
them
are
certainly
worthy
of
serious
consideration.
but
those
issues
belong
for
consideration
with
congress
and
not
with
the
court.
we
rely
on
the
statute.
we
believe,
if
the
statute
is
relied
upon,
the
conclusions
we've
advanced
will
be--
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
--i...
i
don't
know
that
figure.
i
recall
hearing
the
term
"million",
but
i
would
be
guessing
wildly
to
say
it.
i
do
know
that
there
are
hundreds
of
thousands
of
cases
of
hiv,
where
it's
not
known
how
the
transmission
occurred.
and
that,
we
think,
it
important
when
you're
looking
at
this
question
of
under
reporting.
mr.
john
w.
mccarthy
well,
the
question
is,
does
he...
what's
the
then
current
medical
knowledge?
he
has
all
of
this
information
before
him,
including
osha,
these
seven
cases,
what's
occurred
in
other
cases.
we
certainly
believe
there's
good
reason
for
him
to
believe
and
take
the
position
that
there
could
be
risk.
and
it
was
a
reasonable
judgment
for
him
to
make.
thank
you.
