justice
david
h.
souter
you're
saying...
you're...
you're
referring,
when
you
keep
referring
to
the
examples
in
the
regs,
to
the
one
set
out
on
page...
in
the
appendix
to
your
brief,
36.104--
justice
david
h.
souter
--which
has
the
examples,
and
i
take
it
your
argument
is
that
all
of
those
examples
go
to
the
capacity
of
an
individual
in
effect
to
survive
personally.
they
are
the
things
that
one
has
to
do
to
live,
but
they
do
not
go
beyond
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that's
why
you
would
pick
up
eating,
but
you
would
draw
the
line...
one
does
not
have
to
reproduce
in
order
to
survive.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
do
i
under...
i
may
not
understand
you.
do
i
understand
you
correctly
that
in
response,
for
example,
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
that
your
point
is
that
under
the
reg
the
substantial
limitation
goes
to
what
the
individual
can
do
by
himself
alone.
it
does
not
go
to
what
others
may
do
in
relation...
in
other
words,
discrimination
is
not
a...
cannot
amount
itself
to
a
disability?
justice
david
h.
souter
is
others
caring
for
one?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
even
if
you
put...
and
i
realize
you're
not
doing
it,
but
even
if
you
put
reproduction
within
the
approved
list
of
activities
that
the
statute
is
getting
at,
i
take
it
you
make
a
distinction
between,
let's
say,
a
person
who
is
infertile
and
a
person
who
simply
has
hiv.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
and
what
is
that
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
let's
assume
we
get
over
that
point
and
we
classify
this
as
one
of
the
activities
that
does,
in
fact,
belong
within
the
series
of
examples.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
i
understood
you
to
make
a
distinction
even
at
that
point...
you're
sort
of,
not
at
the
last
ditch,
but
you're
close
to
it.
i
understood
you
to
be
making
a
distinction
at
that
point
between
the
position
of
the
individual
with
the
hiv
infection
and
the
individual
who
is
infertile
or
who
is
impotent
or
who
is
sterile,
and
you
said
yes,
you
did
make
such
a
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
your
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
i
thought
your...
the
argument
that
was
suggested
you
didn't...
i
don't
think
you
went
into
it
in
great
detail...
was
that
the
person
with
hiv
can
in
fact
perform
the
sexual
function,
can
reproduce.
the
person
who
is
sterile,
or
infertile,
or
impotent,
cannot.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
crucially
different--
justice
david
h.
souter
--if
you
get
to
that
point,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
can
they
not?
the...
the
difficulty
that
i'm
having
with
your
argument
is
that
you
are...
you
are
using
the
judgment
that
your
client
made,
a...
a
very
responsible
moral
judgment,
as
being
equivalent
to
the
limitation
that
the
statute
talks
about
and
that
the
regs
talk
about.
and
without
certainly
any
disrespect
for
the
moral
judgment
that
your
client
has
made,
i
don't
find
it
that
easy
to
transfer
from
the
moral
limitation
that
she
has
placed
upon
herself
to
the
limitation
that
the
statute
is
speaking
of.
the
statute
speaks
in
terms
of...
of
there
being
a
substantial
limit
upon
an
activity.
and
the
regulation...
i
take
it
the
regulation
that's
closest
to
it
is
the
one
set
out
on...
on
page
7a
of
the
government's
brief.
and
let
me
just
read
the
sentence
that
gives
me
the...
the
greatest
difficulty
in...
in
relation
to
your
case.
i
am
reading
from
the
middle
of
page
7a--
"a
person
is
considered
an
individual
with
a
disability
for
purposes
of
test
a,
the
first
prong
of
the
definition,
when
the
individual's
important
life
activities
are
restricted
as
to
the
condition,
manner,
or
duration
under
which
they
can
be
performed
in
comparison
to
most
people.
"
"can
be
performed"
sounds
to
me
like
a
physical
capacity
to
perform
them.
it
doesn't
sound
like
a
responsibly,
self
imposed
limitation.
could
you
address
the
difficulty
i'm
having
in
getting
from
"can
be"
to
moral
limitation?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
the
question
is,
why
are
those
conditions
moral
conditions
rather
than
physical
conditions?
justice
david
h.
souter
no.
but
the...
the...
the
physical
impairment
of
hiv,
certainly
at
the
asymptomatic
stage
that
we're
talking
about
here,
does
not
in
any...
as
i
understand
it...
does
not
in
any
way
limit
the
physical
capacity
to
engage
in
reproductive
function,
whether
it
be
male
or
female.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there
again,
that...
that's...
that's
a
fine
statement.
and...
and
people
who
reproduce
ought
to
consider
how
they're
going
to
nurture.
but
i'm
not
sure
that
that's
what
the
statute
is
talking
about.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
what
the
courts
have
meant
thus
far
in
talking
about
reproduction.
i
presume
they
have
been
talking
about
reproduction
as
in
fact
a
physical,
biological
activity
that
results
in
the
birth
of
a
baby,
in
the
normal
course.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
it
flows
through
a
choice
about
what
i
ought
to
do
in
relation
to
other
people.
i
ought
not
to
expose
the
airplane
full
of
people
to
my
cold.
that's
the
way
the
limitation
flows.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
moral
choice
is
crucial
to...
to
the...
to
the
consequence
that
you
draw
from
the
physical
act...
the
physical
infection.
but...
but
are
all
good
sens...
i've
been
interrupted
before
you
answered
my
question...
are
there...
are
all
sensible
safeguards
for
the
public's
safety
moral
choices?
