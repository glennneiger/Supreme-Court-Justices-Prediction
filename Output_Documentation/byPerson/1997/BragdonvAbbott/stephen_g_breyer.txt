justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
it
doesn't
mean,
does
it,
the
major
life
activity,
that
the
life
activity
has
to
be
related
to
the
performance
of
the
job?
i
mean,
a
person
could
be
blind.
that
doesn't
mean
the
blind
person
would
not
be...
would
be
not
disabled
simply
because
some
jobs
don't
require
seeing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
if
that's
correct--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--if
that's
correct,
then
let's
take
a
person
who
had
some
eating
disorder,
or
couldn't...
that's
not
on
the
list,
i
don't
think,
eating
disorders,
but
people
are
terribly
frightened
of
getting
it,
so
he
can't
eat
except
in
very,
very
unusual
ways,
a
very
serious
problem.
people
are
frightened
to
death
of
getting
it.
does
that
fall
within
the
act?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
would
think
so.
[laughter]
and
then
if
that's
so,
why
isn't
reproductive
activity,
which
includes
the
person
having
a
sex
life,
i
take
it...
i
mean,
you'd
think
perhaps
that
that
is
at
least
regarded
in
this
society
as
a
major
activity,
portion
of
human
life.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
regulation
didn't
refer
to
eating.
i
didn't
see
eating
on
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
about
a
person
who
couldn't
feel,
some
unusual
disease
where
he
can't
feel
at
all.
i
mean,
i
take
it
you
put
that
on
there,
even
though
it
doesn't
mention
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
exactly.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if
that's
so,
my
question
is,
if
you're
willing
to
put
in
things
that
relate
to
feeling,
things
that
relate
to
eating,
things
that
relate
to
those
things
which
are
part
of
our
ordinary
human
life,
and
if
you
also
say
that
sexual
activity
is
an
ordinary
part
of
human
life,
and
an
important
part,
why
isn't
that
on
there,
too?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
what
you
started
with,
which
is
what
i
think
you
wanted
to
get
to,
and
that
is,
you
were
talking
about
was
this
dentist
reasonable
in
his
fear,
and
in
respect
to
that
you
asked
about
the
standard,
and
i
gather
that
there
are
standards
in
the
regs.
the
direct
threat
must
rely
on
an
individualized
assessment
based
on
a
reasonable
judgment,
relies
on
current
medical
knowledge,
and
in
arline
this
court
said
courts
should
normally
defer
to
the
reasonable
medical
judgments
of
public
health
officials.
on
those
standards,
assuming,
as
i
think
is
correct,
after
15
years
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
people
dead
as
a
result
of
this
disease,
i
gather
after
15
years
and
hundreds
of
thousands
of
deaths,
there
isn't
one
case...
maybe
just
one...
in
which
a
dentist,
despite
hundreds
of
thousands
of
dentists
who
do
treat
aids
patients,
there
isn't
one
case
in
which
one
of
those
dentists
documentedly
caught
aids
from
a
patient.
now,
if
that's
so,
how
could
we
say
here
that
your
client
exercised
reasonable
medical
judgment?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
he
said
they
weren't
dentists.
he
said
those
were
not
dentists.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
in
the
record?
that
study
is
in
the
record?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
i
would
think
so,
too.
[laughter]
and
the...
then,
even
though
you
haven't
shown
symptoms
yet,
you
haven't
shown
symptoms,
you're
not...
you're
not...
you're
not
that...
i
mean,
that...
that
is
not
so
obvious,
but
i...
can
i
ask
you
another...
a
different
a
slightly
different--
--may
i
say
that
i
don't
think
that's
so
obvious.
i...
i--
--but
i
agreed
with
you,
it
isn't
obvious.
it
is
not
obvious.
but
i
think
that...
that
that's
the
kind
of
issue
we're
talking
about.
if...
if
the...
what
i...
what
i'd
like
to...
to
know
is
just
a
quick
factual
question.
i
read
the
aba
brief.
and
it
says
none
of
the
documented
cases...
the
42
they're
talking
about...
involved
a
dental
practitioner.
you
know,
i
don't
read
these
briefs
with
a
absolute
dental
practitioner...
was
it
a
dental...
i
assumed
it
didn't
have
somebody
who
was
in
the
dentist's
office.
now,
were
these
cases
dental
practitioners
or
were
they
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
by
that,
you're
not
using
some
technical
loaded
thing.
you
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
somebody
like
a
person
who's
in
the
dentist's
office
and
who
is
working,
i
would
call
a
dental
practitioner.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
can't
tell
us
that
there's
never
been
a
case...
which
is
what
you
said...
they
can't
tell
us
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
how
many
cases
of
aids
had
there
been
approximately
as
of
1994?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
suppose
the
worst
that
could
have
happened
is
that
he
though
there
was
a
risk
of
7...
if
he'd
looked
into
it,
7
cases
in
a
million.
that's
about
1
in
120,000.
that's
certainly
not
lightning.
what
are
we
supposed
to
do?
