unknown
speaker
you
said
the
business
of
banking
or
any
federally
insured
institution.
would
that
have
applied
to
a
bank
which
was
not
federally
insured?
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
thought,
mr.
rothbaum?
you
say
they
were
indicted
for
the
same
loans.
now,
of
course,
they
were
actually
indicted
for
violating
certain
statutes,
and
you
were
penalized
for
violating
certain
rules,
and
the
government
argues
the
blockburger
test
is
not
met
in
this
case,
and
you
say
the
blockburger
test
doesn't
apply,
as
i
understand.
if
the
blockburger
test
did
apply,
is
it
not
clear
that
it's
not
satisfied?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
simple
test.
one
statute
requires
an
element,
the
other
does
not,
and
vice
versa.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
meet
that
test
here,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
so
even
acknowledging
that
we've
never
done
it
expressly
in
this...
because
we
don't
have
very
many
of
these
cases,
is
there
any
reason
why
that
test
should
not
be
applied,
because
even
if
you
say
same
transaction,
you
have
to
in
some
way
define
exactly
what
it
is
the
transaction
gave
rise
to
the
two
different
punishments.
why
doesn't
it
make
sense
just
to
apply
blockburger?
unknown
speaker
if
blockburger
is
adequate
protection
for
two
criminal
prosecutions,
then
a
fortiori
ought
to
be
adequate
protection
for
a
criminal
and
a
civil
prosecution.
what's
wrong
with
that
formula?
unknown
speaker
but
double,
double
jeopardy
provision
is
designed
to
protect
someone
from
being
twice
prosecuted,
basically.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
what
you're
doing
is,
you
have
had
one
criminal
prosecution,
you've
had
one
civil
prosecution,
and
now
you're
saying,
well,
we
claim
that
the
civil
prosecution
was
actually
punitive
under
halper,
but
surely
if
the
double
jeopardy
provision
is
designed
to
prohibit
two
prosecutions
blockburger
should
be
plenty
of...
plenty
sufficient
to
protect
the
double
jeopardy
interest,
for
one
of
the
things
is
civil.
unknown
speaker
but
you
have
to
really
squeeze
to
get
the
civil
thing
into
double
jeopardy
at
all,
because
the
classic
doctrine
is
that
the
law
doesn't
prohibit
the
imposition
of
one
criminal
and
one
civil
penalty.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
what
congress
said
here,
was
that
it
was
civil.
unknown
speaker
well,
strain
to
get
it...
to
make
it
criminal,
in
order
to
get
it
within
the
double
jeopardy
rule,
then
once
there,
you
strain
to
get
it
out
through
the
blockburger
test.
unknown
speaker
were
those
double
jeopardy
cases,
the
ones
you--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
rothburger,
i...
rothbaum,
i
assume
that
to
succeed
here
you
really
have
to
rely
on
this
court's
halper
decision
in
large
part.
unknown
speaker
but
it
certainly
said
on
its
face
that
it
was
reserved
for
the
rare
case,
and
there
was
a
far
greater
disparity
there
in
the
amounts
selected,
and
the
government's
expenses,
than
would
be
the
case
here.
i'm
not
sure
that
even
on
its
face
your
petition
would
meet
halper
under
any
standard,
and
the
second
thing
i
want
you
to
address
is
that
it
looks
to
me
like
halper
may
have
been
driven
in
part
by
due
process
concerns
about
vindictive
use
of
civil
proceedings
following
a
criminal
prosecution.
now,
here,
the
civil
sanctions
were
imposed
first,
were
they
not?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
no
danger
here
of
a
vindictiveness
or
a
due
process
sort
of
concern
that
may
have
driven
halper.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
so
if
halper
is
limited
in
that
fashion,
as
i
think
it
might
be,
how
do
you
prevail?
unknown
speaker
about
every
book
on
my
wall
is
a
rare
case.
[laughter]
we're
never
very
successful
up
here
when
you
say
this
is
a
rare
case.
the
states
are
having
a
tremendously
difficult
time.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
wasn't
the
rarity
that
halper
was
talking
about
a
reference
to
the
nature
of
the
civil
penalty
involved
there,
and
if
so,
what
is
the
rarity
here?
unknown
speaker
are
we
still
talking
about
civil
preceding
criminal,
which
is
how
we
got
into
this
discussion
with
a
question
from
justice
o'connor?
i
thought
your
response
for
that
is
that
the
basic
claim
here
is
a
double
jeopardy
claim.
unknown
speaker
and
the
assertion
is
that
double
punishment
violates
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
as
halper
held,
whether
it's
civil
or
criminal,
and
double
punishment
is
double
punishment,
no
matter
which
one
comes
first.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see...
how
do
you
run
around
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
some
civil
penalties
aren't
punishment,
others
are,
and
they're
all
penalties,
and
so
accepting
that
it
doesn't
matter,
that
the
order
doesn't
matter,
accepting
that
arguendo,
what
penalties
are
okay
because
they're
civil,
and
what
civil
penalties
are
not
okay
because
they're
really
punishment?
how
do
we...
the
books
are
filled
with
civil
penalties.
how
do
we
which
ones
are
okay,
don't
get
us
into
double
jeopardy
problems,
and
the
ones
that
do?
i
mean,
what
standards
would
pass
muster
as
a
genuine
civil
penalty,
no
double
jeopardy
problem?
unknown
speaker
but
why
should
we
import
from
the
distinction
between
civil
contempt
and
criminal
contempt,
which
hicks
dealt
with,
i
think...
why
should
we
import
that
into
this
area?
unknown
speaker
when
is
a
penalty
not
a
punishment,
a
wonderful...
the
unsophisticated
mind
would
think
that
a
penalty
is
always
a
punishment,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so,
but...
it's
got
to
be
something
more
than,
like,
a
day
fine
that's
meant
to
get
you
to
comply
with
the
law.
that
will
never
be
the
case
here,
because
you've
already
not
complied,
and
whatever
the
penalty
is
for,
it's
for
past
conduct.
it's
already
done.
so
you're
giving
hicks
as
an
example,
where
the
whole
idea
is,
you
got
the
keys
to
the
kingdom,
to
the
jailhouse
in
your
pocket,
comply,
and
you're
home
free.
here,
you're
being
penalized
for
something
you
did
in
the
past,
so
that's
why
i
can't
get
much
from
hicks.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
just
like
to
know
what
is
a
civil
penalty...
that
is,
definitely
was
something
you'd
done
in
the
past,
not
to
get
you
to
comply,
come
into
compliance
with
the
law,
but
something
that
you've
done
in
the
past,
what
kind
of
penalty...
can
there
be
such
a
thing
as
a
civil
penalty
that
doesn't
get
you
into
double
jeopardy
problems?
unknown
speaker
that's
like
revoking
a
drivers
license.
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
things
you
haven't
brought
up
is
the...
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
is
the
justification
that
the
government
is
basically
recouping
its
enforcement
costs.
why
isn't
that
something
we
ought
to
consider
as
a
criterion?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
leaves
the
question
entirely
open,
i
guess.
i
mean,
you
can't
tell
from
what
congress
has
said
what
the
object
is,
i
guess,
can
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
how
can
we
say
that?
i
mean,
i
would--
unknown
speaker
--i
thought
the
criteria
were
the
occ's
criteria.
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
unknown
speaker
sure,
to
the
extent
that
it
may
be
attributable
to
your...
to
any
given
defendant's
behavior,
but
i
guess
your
answer
is
that
if
we
were
to
assume
that
recoupment
of
government
cost,
even
on
this
attribution
basis,
was
a
relevant
criterion
in
deciding
where
the...
whether
a
penalty
had
crossed
the
line
into
something
that
was
significant
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
that
your
client
in
fact
would
have
the
advantage
of
such
a
criterion,
because
you're
saying
under
this
statute
that
clearly
is
not
what
congress
was
intending
to
do,
so--
unknown
speaker
--so
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
relevant
consideration
as
a
general
matter
for
us?
unknown
speaker
how
many
statutes
are
there
with
standards
like,
has
this
been
done
in
the
past,
good
faith,
the
standards
that
are
used
here?
aren't
there
many
statutes
labeled
civil
penalties
that
are
just
like
this
one?
i'm
trying
to
see
the
consequences
of
holding
in
your
favor,
if
we
say
statutes
like
this
are
no
good.
aren't
there
dozens
of
them
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
but
you've
said
the
reason
is
that
the
statute
is
not
a
hicks-type,
comply
with
the
law,
and
it
isn't
compensating
the
government
for
a
specific
financial
loss,
so
i'm
thinking
how
many
statutes
fit
that
standard,
and
my
guess
is,
there
are
a
great
many.
unknown
speaker
well,
many
civil
provisions
are
designed
to
prohibit
unlawful
conduct
where
the
government
itself
isn't
harmed
at
all.
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
theory,
i
mean,
that
would
mean
they'd
never
fit--
unknown
speaker
--the
criteria,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
also
are
characterizing
both
the
civil
money
penalties
and
the
nonparticipation
orders
here
as
punitive,
and
under
your
theory,
i
guess,
they
couldn't
even
be
brought
in
separate
proceedings
without
falling
in
violation
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
suppose...
but
they
had
the
liberty
to
reapply,
didn't
they,
so
the
monetary
penalties
in
case
they
got
in
again
would
surely
deter
them
from
doing
what
they
did
before.
unknown
speaker
it's
very
possible.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
look
at
the
statute,
i
mean,
are
we
bound
by
what
occ
says
at
the
time?
the
question
is,
what
was
congress'
intent,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
suggesting
it.
unknown
speaker
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
no,
you
didn't
miss
anything.
[laughter]
thank
you,
mr.
rothbaum.
mr.
dreeben.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
we
do
with
language
in
halper?
halper's
part
of
the
problem,
right?
unknown
speaker
yes,
that's
what
i'm
talking
about.
i
mean,
that
leads
to
a
lot
of
problems.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask,
assuming
the
language
is
much
too
broad
in
halper,
do
you
think
there
was
punishment
in
halper?
unknown
speaker
so
it
really
isn't
just
a
question
of
language.
the
holding
is
basically
wrong
in
your
position.
unknown
speaker
we
can't
ignore
cases
as
though
they
had
never
been
decided--
unknown
speaker
--and
having
been
decided,
do
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
unknown
speaker
was
there
some
element
of
vindictiveness
in
sort
of
a
due
process
focus,
do
you
think,
in
halper?
unknown
speaker
that's
the
vindictiveness
element.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
a
dissatisfaction
by
the
government,
we
had
this
criminal
prosecution
and
we
didn't
get
much
punishment
out
of
it,
now
let's
go
do
something
about
that.
we've
got
this
civil
remedy
here.
unknown
speaker
halper
didn't
discuss
blockburger
for
some
reason,
in
the
sense
of
thinking
that
applied.
unknown
speaker
were
the
penalties
in
halper
not
regulatory
under
this
scheme
that
you're
putting
forth,
that
they're
distinguishable
from
the
kind
of
penalties
that
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
they
were
distinguishable,
or
they
were
regulatory?
unknown
speaker
mr.
dreeben,
apart
from
the
fact
that
this
definition
of
punishment
would
enable
the
government
to
win
this
case,
what
is
there
to
be
said
for
it?
i
mean,
in
the
language
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
in
the
common
understanding
of
punishment?
i
mean,
are
we
just
authorized
to
give
punishment
whatever
definition
in
the
world
we
want
in
order
to
produce
results
that
we
sort
of
like?
unknown
speaker
yes,
well,
that...
yes,
we
could
start
with
that,
and
48
states
have
asked
us
to
overrule
halper
because
of
that.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt?
it
seems
fairly
clear,
if
you
apply
blockburger,
that
wouldn't
have
barred
the
criminal
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
so
that
really
in
this
statute
you
don't
have
the
practical
problem
that
concerns
you
generally.
unknown
speaker
how
would
you
go
about
applying
blockburger
when
you
compare
the
civil
and
the
criminal
charges
in
light
of
the
different
burdens
of
proof?
does
that
matter?
unknown
speaker
regardless
of
the
burden.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
dreeben,
going
back
to
the
second
part
of
ward,
the
criteria
that
the
agency
uses
sound
like
traditional
sentencing
criteria
to
me,
i
mean,
as
set
out
on
page
3...
wilfulness,
insider
status,
previous
warnings,
history
of
violations,
loss,
number
of
violations,
duration,
continuation,
and
so
on.
i
mean,
that
sounds
like
common
law
punishment
to
me.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
exactly
what
common
law
courts
do
in
sentencing.
unknown
speaker
may
we're
trying
to
have
it
both
ways,
and
maybe
you're
accepting
that
difficulty
of
ours
in
answering
as
you
do,
because
i
don't
know
how
to
draw
the
line.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
the
order
of
the
proceedings
that
you're
getting
at.
unknown
speaker
the
eighth
amendment
uses
the
word
punishment,
by
the
way,
which
is
a
great
advantage
over
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
think...
what...
if
i
understand
what
your
telling
me
is,
number
1
we
ought
to
consider
the
consequence
of
applying
double
jeopardy
here,
and
you're
saying,
when
it
would
foreclose
the
criminal
proceeding
that
is
a
more
serious
consequence,
and
is
entitled
to
weight
in
our
line-drawing
than
if
it
would
impose
merely
a
civil
proceeding.
i
think
that's
the
first
thing
you're
saying.
beyond
that,
is
there
any
sort
of
line-drawing
criterion?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
you're--
unknown
speaker
--so
right
away--
--that's
not
a
line.
that's
what's
not
a
line.
we're
asking
you
what
the
line
is.
you're
telling
us
what
the
line
isn't.
unknown
speaker
the
line
is
not
deterrence.
unknown
speaker
but
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
one
know
that
when
it's
so
punitive?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
you
had
started
out
by
saying
you're
not...
you're
accepting
halper,
halper's
language
is
too
broad,
it
has
to
be
confined,
and
i
had
written
down,
fixed
penalty,
totally
disproportionate.
now,
what
else?
unknown
speaker
to...
no.
what
should
our
standard
be
for
saying,
this
is
labeled
civil
penalty,
but
it
gets
into
double
jeopardy
territory
because
it's
punishment,
and
we
know
that
for
what
identifying
characteristics?
and
so
you...
what
you
started
to
say
now,
using
ward,
is,
when
it
becomes...
the
words
were...
are
highly
generalized,
so
i
would
like
you
to
be
more
concrete.
unknown
speaker
well,
if--
--well,
mr.
dreeben,
in
halper
the
criminal
prosecution
occurred
first
and
then
the
civil
penalties.
unknown
speaker
and
at
least
as
i
look
at
it
it
seemed
to
me
to
have
some
element
in
there
of
a
concern
by
the
court
of
vindictiveness
and
disproportionality,
if
you
will,
and
due
process-type
concerns.
here,
in
this
case,
the
civil
sanctions
were
imposed
first,
so
none
of
that
could
be
present.
maybe
that
line
is
useful.
what
comes
first?
unknown
speaker
it
would
really
cut
halper
loose
from
all
reasoning,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
which...
on
which
it
was
based.
mr.
dreeben,
don't
you
think
it
would
be
even
more
vindictive
if
the
government,
having
lost
an
action
for
civil
penalties,
was
so
mad
that
it
prosecuted
the
person
criminally?
that's
real
vindictiveness.
unknown
speaker
no.
i'm
saying,
if
you're
looking
for
a
situation
that
displays
vindictiveness,
it's
not
the
one
where
the
civil
precedes...
follows
the
criminal,
it's
the
one
where
the
civil
precedes
the
criminal
and,
having
lost
the
civil
case,
the
government
is
so
enraged
it
prosecutes
the
person
criminally.
unknown
speaker
that
seems
to
be
more
vindictive,
not
less.
unknown
speaker
but
you
did
mention
issue
preclusion,
which
would
be
a
good,
neutral
reason
for
doing
the
criminal
prosecution
first,
because
if
you
win
in
the
criminal
prosecution,
if
you've
established
the
facts
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
then
you
do
have
issue
preclusion--
unknown
speaker
--in
the
civil
case.
unknown
speaker
but
both
of
those
standards
would
have
been
met
in
halper,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
but
the
statute
authorized
the
penalties.
unknown
speaker
but
before
you
get
to
the
eighth
amendment
excessive
fines
provision,
you
have
to
show
that
it
is
a
penalty,
do
you
not?
unknown
speaker
in
our
punitive
damages
cases
and
jurisprudence,
haven't
we
said
that
the
eighth
amendment
applies
only
to
a
criminal
proceeding
for
excessive
fines?
unknown
speaker
in
the
forfeiture
area,
yes.
unknown
speaker
we
have
said
punitive
damages
are
not
fines,
though.
all
right,
i'll
look
it
up.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
dreeben.
mr.
rothbaum,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown

what
happens
if
you
have
a
government
agency
or
something
says,
we're
going
to
fine
you
$10
if
you're
late
for
a
meeting.
what's
the
point
of
the
fine?
well,
we
want
to
get
people
to
the
meeting.
only
deterrence.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
not
remedial.
they
said,
why'd
you
do
it?
well,
people
are
late
for
the
meeting.
we
want
them
to
be
there
on
time,
$3
first
meeting,
$5
second.
criminal?
you
have
to
have
a
trial,
and...
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--maybe
there's
never
such
a
thing,
but
perhaps
some
day
somebody
might
think
of
it.
people
get
late
for
the
meetings
in
other
organizations.
they
fine
you
if
you're
late,
a
little
fine.
i
think
it
would
be
a
very
good
idea.
[laughter]
right.
if
that's
so,
i'm
interested
in
the
criteria.
unknown
speaker
they're
solely
deterrent,
just
like
my
fine.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
it's
the
size.
it's
not
now
a
question
of
whether
it's
serving
a
purely
deterrent--
