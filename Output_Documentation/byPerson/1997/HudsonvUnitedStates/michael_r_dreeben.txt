mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
civil
money
penalties
serve
a
vital
purpose
in
federal
regulatory
schemes
because
they
serve
as
an
ongoing
motivation
to
regulated
parties
to
conform
their
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
the
law.
for
four
reasons,
our
position
is
that
the
imposition
of
civil
money
penalties
in
such
regulatory
schemes
does
not
constitute
a
bar
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
petitioners'
subsequent
criminal
prosecution.
first,
civil
money
penalties
in
such
regulatory
schemes,
like
civil
forfeiture
actions,
do
not
constitute
punishment
for
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment.
second,
even
assuming
that
these
penalties--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
think,
justice
o'connor,
that
to
a
large
extent
this
court
has
clarified
and
limited
much
of
the
language
in
halper
which
could
be
read
to
lead
to
very
broad
results,
including
results
such
as
petitioners
are
arguing
for
today.
one
of
the
most
significant
features
of
halper
was
its
extraordinarily
broad
definition
of
punishment
as
encompassing
any
sanction
that
had--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
leads
to
a
lot
of
problems
because
halper
thought,
or
said
that
any
sanction
that
couldn't
be
solely
explained
without
reference
to
deterrence
or
retribution
must
be
deemed
punishment
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
at
least
twice
since
that
case
this
court
has
retrenched
somewhat
from
halper's
description
of
punishment
in
that
respect.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think
not,
justice
stevens.
our
position
in
halper
was
that
there
was
not
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
double
jeopardy.
there
was
in
a
common
sense--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--oh,
our
position
was
then--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--excepting--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--except
in
the
holding
of
halper--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--yes.
then
the
court's
conclusion
in
that
case
was
that
there
was
punishment,
but
the
court
reached
that
by
a
process
of
analysis
that
required
looking
at
the
fact
that
it
was
a
fixed
penalty,
that
the
penalty
was
totally
disproportionate
to
the
only
legitimate
aims
of
the
statute
that
were
not
punitive,
which
in
that
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
have
never
seen
that
in
the
opinion,
justice
o'connor.
i
do
think
that
it
was
significant
to
the
court
that
halper
had
been
first
criminally
prosecuted,
that
the
government
then
came
in
and
obtained
civil
penalties--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
wouldn't
be
prepared
to
concede
that
that
was
vindictiveness,
because
there
was
no
showing
in
that
case,
and
i
don't
think
that
the
record
would
bear
the
conclusion
that
the
government
was
motivated
to
punish
halper
for
exercise
of
any
of
his
constitutional
rights,
which
is
normally
the
due
process
test
that
would
apply
in
a
criminal
case.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
if
that
were
true,
then
it
would
mean
that
halper
should
not
be
viewed
as
a
double
jeopardy
case
at
all,
because
that
analysis
i
would
think
would
apply
even
if
it
were
clear
that
the
second
case
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
elements
that
were
proved
in
the
first
case
and
thus
wasn't
the
same
offense
under
blockburger.
we
do
think
that
halper
should
be,
to
the
extent
that
it's--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
didn't
raise
a
blockburger
or
same
elements
issue
in
halper
because
the
civil
false
claims
act
and
the
criminal
false
claims
provisions
would
appear
to
be
satisfied
under
that
test.
we
brought
the
case
on
a
direct
appeal
from
a
district
court
decision
to
this
court,
raising
only
the
question
of
whether
a
civil
false
claims
sanction
could
ever
be
deemed
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment.
we
argued
then
that
only
criminal
punishment
could
satisfy
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
this
court
rejected
that,
and
the
question
is
whether
the
analysis
that
was
used
in
halper
should
carry
over
to
the
very
different
kind
of
penalties
that
are
at
issue
in
this
case.
civil
money
regulatory
penalties
aim
primarily
to
shape
the
conduct
of
parties
who
are
subject
to
regulation
by
sitting
as
an
ever-present
reminder
that
there
are
consequences
for
violation
of
the
law,
and
agencies
use
them
for
precisely
that
purpose,
which
is
appropriately
described
as
a
deterrent
purpose.
now,
under
a
broad
reading
of
halper,
which
i
think
petitioners
have
at
times
embraced,
any
deterrent
purpose
would
brand
these
sanctions
as
punitive
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
but
this
court
has
made
clear,
both
in
kurth
ranch
and
in
united
states
v.
ursery,
that
even
an
obvious
deterrent
purpose
does
not
mean
that
a
civil
sanction
constitutes
punishment
and
applying
an
analysis
that
respected
that
factor
in
ursery,
this
court
concluded
that
even
though
civil
forfeiture
proceedings
are
imposed
largely
to
motivate
owners
of
property
not
to
allow
their
property
to
be
used
in
violation
of
the
law,
that
civil
forfeiture
should
not
be
deemed
punishment
for
double
jeopardy
purposes
even
if
it
might
be
deemed
punishment
under
a
common
sense
view,
or
plain
view,
or
under
other
constitutional
provisions.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
they
were,
justice
kennedy,
and
they
are
for
two
reasons.
the
first
reason
is
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--they
are
distinguishable.
they
were
not
regulatory.
the
court
deemed
the
penalties
that
were
imposed
under
the
false
claims
act
to
be
analogous
to
liquidated
damages
that
a
party
may
collect,
whether
it
governmental
or
private,
when
it
has
been
damaged
by
fraud,
and
the
court
reached
that
conclusion
by
looking
at
the
character
of
the
sanctions
that
were
authorized
by
the
statute:
damages,
actual
damages,
double
damages,
and
a
fixed
penalty
which
the
court
viewed
as
a
way
of
getting
rough
compensation
for
the
government,
to
include
not
only
its
direct
losses,
but
costs
of
investigation
and
costs
of
prosecution.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
the
starting
point
is
suggested
by
the
fact
that
the
word
punishment
is
not
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
there
is,
i
think,
an
irreducible
need
to
consider
the
fact
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
speaks
in
language
that
undeniably
connotes
a
criminal
offense.
it
speaks
of
putting
somebody
in
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb,
and
it
speaks
of
an
offense,
and
those
are
concepts
that
have
primary
application,
if
not
exclusive
application,
to
criminal
conduct.
now,
we
suggest
in
this
case
that
the
appropriate
test
to
reconcile
the
double
jeopardy
clause
and...
with
the
possibility
that
civil
sanctions
may
be
misused
in
a
way
that
could
implicate
that
clause,
is
to
apply
the
test
that
this
court
described
in
united
states
v.
ward.
first
determine
whether
congress
intended
a
civil
sanction,
and
then
determine
whether
there
is
any
evidence,
by
the
clearest
proof,
that
congress'
intent
to
create
a
civil
sanction
should
be
overridden
and
that
the
sanction
should
be
deemed
criminal.
that
is
a
test
that
i
think
is
not
only
responsive
to
the
language
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
reflects
the
fact
that
the
consequences
under
double
jeopardy
are
very
significant
to
the
government.
in
this
case,
we
went
in
through
the
occ
and
found
violations
of
banking
regulations,
imposed
civil
penalties,
imposed
nonparticipation
requirements
on
the
petitioners
through
their
settlement,
and
obtained
important
results
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
office
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency's
regulation
of
the
banking
system.
subsequently--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
agree,
justice
stevens.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
i
agree
with
that,
justice
stevens.
there
are
many
other
federal
regulatory
statutes
where
there
is
a
civil
enforcement
provision
that
includes
money
penalties
and
that
has
a
criminal
counterpart
that
requires
perhaps
an
additional
element
of
scienter
or
wilfulness,
but
that
the
elements
are
essentially
identical,
and--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
that
it
does,
justice
o'connor,
if
one
embarks
on
the
enterprise
of
applying
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
civil
proceedings.
the
question
then
would
be,
under
blockburger,
are
the
elements
required
to
be
proved
by
the
government
in
the
civil
case
the
same
constitutionally.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
regardless
of
the
burden
of
proof.
that
would
not
be
a
ground
on
which
we
would
suggest
that
these
can
be
distinguished.
now,
it
is,
of
course,
true,
that
if
we
brought,
for
example,
a
criminal
federal
securities
case,
and
the
defendant
was
acquitted,
and
we
then
sought
to
bring
a
civil
federal
securities
case
that
had
the
same
identical
elements,
we
would
not
be
barred
because
the
defendant
would
have
no
multiple
punishment
argument
and
the
burden
of
proof
is
lighter
in
a
civil
case,
so
the
criminal
conviction...
the
criminal
acquittal
would
not
constitute
any
kind
of
a
collateral
estoppel
bar
on
the
government
proceeding.
but
that,
of
course,
is
not
what
we
have
here.
what
we
have
here
is
an
agency
that,
in
the
course
of
enforcing
its
own
requirements,
and
to
keep
its
reins
on
the
regulatory...
regulated
parties
that
are
before
it,
imposes
civil
penalties
to
let
all
regulated
parties
know
that
there
are
consequences
for
violating
the
law.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
the
criteria,
justice
souter,
may
not
be
very
different,
but
those
criteria
are
aimed
at
determining
what
level
of
penalties
is
appropriate
to
send
a
deterrence
signal
not
only
to
these
individuals
but
to
the
world
at
large,
and
the
court
has--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--that
is
true,
but
the
court
has
recognized
that
deterrence
is
a
legitimate
nonpunitive
objective
of
the
civil
law.
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
said
in
ursery,
when
it
looked
at
civil
in
rem
forfeiture,
recognized
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
it
was
to
motivate
parties,
not
to
allow
their
property
to
be
used
in
violation
of
the
law,
and
then
held
that
that
form
of
sanction
is
not
punishment
for
double
jeopardy
purposes.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
line
is
one
that
i
think
should
be
drawn
with
reference
to
the
fact
that
the
consequence
under
double
jeopardy
is
entirely
to
foreclose
the
second
proceeding,
as
petitioners
have
presented
the
question
here.
if
they
are
right,
and
we
have
imposed
punishment
in
the
first
proceeding,
and
assuming
that
blockburger
were
satisfied
on
their
behalf,
we
would
then
lose
any
right
whatsoever
to
bring
a
criminal
prosecution.
in
consequence,
if
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
the
order
of
the
proceedings,
but
what
i
wanted
to
focus
on
here
is
simply
that
there
are
radical
consequences
from
deeming
a
sanction
to
be
covered
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
if
the
court
were
to
hold,
and
we
would
not
dispute
that
these
civil
fines
were
sufficiently
punitive
to
implicate
the
concerns
of
the
eighth
amendment,
what
that
would
mean
is
that
there
would
be
constitutional
review
of
the
amount
of
the
fines
that
were
imposed
to
determine
that
they
were
not
excessive.
if
the
court
were
to
determine
that
there
was
a--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--well,
it
does
in
the
cruel
and
unusual
punishments
clause,
but
it
does
not
in
the
excessive
fines
clause,
and
i
think
that
the
court
has
incorporated
notions
of
punishment
into
both
of
those
clauses
to
capture
in
a
colloquial
way
what
they
are
getting
at.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
but
the
constitution
itself
doesn't
use
that
word.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
line
that
i
think
that
comes
out
of
united
states
v.
ursery
is
that...
is
entirely
permissible
for
the
court...
for
congress
to
authorize
civil
sanctions
that
pursue
a
deterrent
purpose,
and
that
that
does
not
brand
them
as
punishment
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
line
would
be--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
test
that
we're
suggesting
in
this
context
is
the
test
articulated
in
united
states
v.
ward.
if
the
sanction
is
framed
as
a
civil
sanction
but
in
purpose
or
effect
it
is
so
punitive
as
to
betray
that
characterization,
then
the
court
will
determine
that--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
does...
how
does
one
know
that,
justice
ginsburg?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
as
far
as
the
scope
of
halper?
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
the
most
concrete
that
i
can
be,
justice
ginsburg,
is
to
note
that
first,
any
civil
sanction
needs
to
be
considered
on
its
own
terms,
so
that
there
will
be
different
results
for
different
kinds
of
civil
sanctions,
and
second,
the
kind
of
civil
sanction
that
we're
talking
about
here,
it
is
not
the
entire
class
of
civil
money
penalties,
it
is
the
class
of
civil
money
penalties
that
are
imposed
for
regulatory
purposes,
and
our
submission
is
that
categorically
the
court
should
conclude
that
if
those
sanctions
are
enacted
under...
imposed
under
statutes
that
passed
the
ward
test,
there
is
not
a
double
jeopardy
problem.
now,
the
ward
test
will
always
be
a
highly
case-specific
enterprise
for
this
court
because,
to
the
extent
it's
been
particularized,
it
looks
to
the
list
of
factors
that
the
court
articulated
in
kennedy
v.
martino
mendoza,
and
those
factors,
the
court
noted
even
in
that
case,
may
point
in
different
directions
and
they
have
to
be
balanced.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
correct.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
that
would
certainly
confine
halper
to
its
facts,
and
would
restrict--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--it
would
cut
halper
loose
from
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
i
don't
think
that
halper
itself
involved
a
case
in
which
vindictiveness
was
established.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
we
might
have
a
problem--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--we
might
have
a
problem
under
conventional
collateral
estoppel
doctrine
if
we
fail
to
persuade
the
fact-finder
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
certain
facts
were
proved,
and
then
we
sought
to
prove
to
another
fact-finder
that
they
were
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
there
are
already
conventional
protections
in
the
law
that
would
cover
cases
like
that,
and
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
where
we
did
that.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
that
is
true,
and
there
are
often
good
reasons
to
do
the
criminal
prosecution
first,
not
the
least
of
which
is
that
grand
jury
investigations
are
surrounded
by
secrecy,
and
you
want
to
encourage
the
grand
jury
to
be
able
to
gather
information
without
interfering
with
any
civil
process,
and
oftentimes
grand
jury
investigations
will
go
forward,
the
civil
case
will
sit
back,
and
there
are
also
many
cases
where
the
government
decides
after
a
criminal
conviction
is
obtained
there's
no
need
to
proceed
with
any
further
proceedings
for
penalties.
but
in
a
case
like
this,
the
agency
made
a
perfectly
valid
judgment
that
there
was
an
importance
to
moving
promptly
to
impose
the
nonparticipation
order
to
protect
members
of
the
public
from
further
potential
banking
violations
by
these
individuals,
and
to
impose
the
civil
penalties
so
that
the
rest
of
the
regulated
industry
was
aware
that
even
a
regulatory
violation
has
consequences,
whether
or
not
down
the
road
somewhere
the
particular
individuals
who
committed
it
were
so
culpable
that
they
should
also
be
subjected
to
criminal
prosecution.
and
it
would
therefore
be
a
fairly
dramatic
consequence
for
the
government
to
have
to
choose
an
election
of
remedies
at
a
point
where
the
agency
knows
that
there's
a
violation,
but
nobody
knows
whether
there
will
be
sufficient
evidence
of
criminal
activity
to
warrant
a
grand
jury
to
indict.
and
in
that
sense,
the
order
of
proceedings
not
only
has
a
great
practical
significance,
but
i
think
that
it
also
has
a
constitutional
significance.
the
submission
of
the
defendants
here
is
that
the
multiple
punishments
doctrine
exists
in
a
fashion
that
makes
a
punishment
a
jeopardy
for
constitutional
purposes.
that
has
never
been
the
traditional
way
that
this
court
has
analyzed
multiple
punishments
questions
even
before
halper.
the
court
has
applied
the
multiple
punishments
doctrine
even
when
there
was
indisputably
a
single
jeopardy.
the
court
has
held
that
the
multiple
punishments
doctrine
prohibited
the
imposition
of
cumulative
punishments
in
one
proceeding
when
the
legislature
has
not
authorized
it,
and
in
those
cases
there
was
clearly
only
one
jeopardy.
the
basic
premise
of
the
multiple
punishments
doctrine
was
that
once
an
individual
has
been
put
in
a
criminal
jeopardy,
additional
punishment
shall
not
be
imposed
on
that
individual
for
the
same
crime,
and
that
is
not
satisfied
in
a
case
in
which
petitioners
here
have
never
been
criminally
indicted
and
have
never
been
criminally
charged.
now,
if
the
court
agrees
with
us
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
categorically
not
applicable
to
civil
regulatory
sanctions
unless
the
defendant
is
able
to
make
the
showing
that,
despite
the
civil
characterization,
the
civil
sanctions
were
in
fact
criminal
under
the
united
states
v.
ward
test,
it
doesn't
mean
that
there's
no
constitutional
limit,
or
no
statutory
limit
to
the
amount
of
civil
penalties
that
the
government
can
impose.
there
is
judicial
review
that
is
governed
by
traditional
apa
standards
of
whether
a
particular
civil
penalty
is
within
the
boundaries
that
have
been
set
by
congress
and
that
are
established
by
the
criteria
of
the
regulatory
agency,
and
there
is
also
review
under
the
eighth
amendment
excessive
fines
clause
to
keep
the
particular
civil
penalties
in
question
within
constitutional
bounds.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
well,
it's
not
clear
whether
they
would
have
been
met
in
halper,
as--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--the
statute
clearly
authorized
it,
and
one
of
the
problems
that
the
court
had
in
halper
that
is
not
present
here
is
that
the
statute
required
the
imposition
of
fixed
penalties
for
every
violation
regardless
of
how
significant
the
fraud
was
to
the
government,
and
that
created
the
potential
for
hugely
disproportionate
civil
sanctions
being
imposed
for
the
particular
fines,
the
particular
violations
that
were
at
issue.
this
case--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
no.
in
fact,
the
holding
of
austin
v.
united
states
is
that
the
eighth
amendment
applies
to
civil
in
rem
forfeiture,
which
is
clearly
a
civil
proceeding.
the
holding
in
the
punitive
damages
cases--
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
--because
it's
an
exaction
by
the
government
of
money
for
a
violation
of
the
law,
and
it
is
true
that
it
has
to
be
in
some
sense
a
penalty.
i
don't
think
a
tax,
for
example,
that
is
a
true
tax
is
subject
to
the
excessive
fines
clause,
and
i
don't
think
that
a
disgorgement
remedy
or
a
damages
remedy
would
be
subject
to
the
excessive
fines
clause,
but
all
that
is
constitutionally
necessary
is
that
there
be
a
fine,
and
we
would
readily
concede
that
the
civil
penalties
that
are
applicable
under
the
statutes
at
issue
here
are
constitutional
fines.
mr.
michael
r.
dreeben
in
addition,
the
court
has
said
that
punitive
damages
are
not
paid
to
the
government
directly.
the
court
reserved
the
question
in
the
browning-ferris
case
of
whether
a
qui
tam
case
might
be
viewed
differently
because
the
government
collects
part
of
the
money,
and
i
think
the
court
would
likewise
reserve
punitive
damage
schemes
where
the
punitive
damages
were
paid
in
part
to
the
state,
but
in
the
conventional
case
where
a
private
party
brings
a
civil
case
and
collects
punitive
damages
the
eighth
amendment
has
nothing
to
say
about
it.
the
eighth
amendment
has
a
lot
to
say
about
what
the
government
does
in
these
civil
fines,
and
therefore
there
should
be
no
reservation
on
the
court's
part
that
there
would
be
no
constitutional
constraint
whatsoever
were
the
double
jeopardy
clause
ruled
inapplicable
to
these
civil
penalties.
thank
you.
