96976,
hudson
against
the
united
states.
in
this
case,
during
the
early
and
mid
1980's,
the
petitioner
john
hudson
was
the
chairman
and
controlling
shareholder
of
the
--
of
two
--
two
banks
in
western
oklahoma.
during
the
same
period,
the
two
other
petitioners
in
this
case
were
officers
of
those
banks.
in
1989,
the
office
of
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
imposed
monetary
penalties
and
occupational
debarments
on
petitioners
for
violating
various
federal
statutes
and
regulations.
when
the
government
later
criminally
indicted
petitioners
for
essentially
the
same
conduct,
they
moved
to
dismiss
the
indictments
on
double
jeopardy
grounds.
the
district
court
ultimately
agreed
with
them
but
the
court
of
appeals
reversed.
it
held
that
under
our
decision
in
the
case
called
united
states
against
halper,
the
actual
fines
imposed
by
the
government
were
not
grossly
proportional
--
disproportional.
in
an
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court
today,
we
--
we
affirm
that
judgment
but
for
different
reasons.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
provides
that
no
person
shall
be
subject
for
the
same
offense
to
be
twice
putting
jeopardy
of
life
or
limb.
we
have
long
held
that
this
clause
protects
only
against
the
imposition
of
multiple
criminal
punishments
for
the
same
offense
and
then
only
when
such
occurs
in
successive
proceeding.
our
opinion
in
united
states
against
halper,
marked
the
first
time
we
applied
the
double
jeopardy
clause
to
a
sanction
without
first
determining
that
it
was
criminal
in
nature.
we
believe
that
halper's
deviation
from
longstanding
double
jeopardy
principles
was
ill-considered.
its
test
for
determining
whether
a
particular
sanction
is
subject
to
the
strictures
that
double
jeopardy
clause
has
proved
unworkable
and
other
constitutional
provisions
addressed
many
of
the
ills
at
which
halper
was
directed.
thus,
we
today,
disavowed
the
method
of
analysis
he
used
in
halper
and
reaffirm
that
traditional
double
jeopardy
rule
exemplified
in
our
opinion
in
united
states
against
ward,
a
case
decided
in
1980,
applying
traditional
double
jeopardy
principles
to
the
facts
of
this
case.
it
is
clear
that
the
criminal
prosecution
of
these
petitioners
would
not
violate
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
congress
intended
the
occ
money
penalties
and
debarments
to
be
civil
in
nature
and
there
is
little
evidence
to
say
nothing
of
the
clearest
proof
required
by
ward
that
these
occ
monetary
penalties
and
debarment
sanctions
are
criminal
despite
congress's
intention
to
the
contrary.
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
therefore
no
obstacle
to
the
trial
of
petitioners
on
the
pending
indictments.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
opinion
in
which
justice
thomas
