mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
double
jeopardy
claims
case
before
the
court
today
had
its
genesis
in
some
bank
loans
in
the
mid-1980's
in
several
small
oklahoma
banks
controlled
by
the
petitioners.
these
loans
were
challenged
by
federal
bank
examiners
as
collectively
violating
insider
lending
regulations.
as
a
result,
in
1989
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
proposed
to
impose
civil
penalties
on
petitioner,
two
types
petitioners...
that's
two
types.
first,
a
lifetime
bar
from
the
business
of
banking
or
at
any
federally
insured
institution,
subject
to
the
right
to
reapply
at
a
later
time
in
writing.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
your
honor,
it
applies
to...
it
actually...
the
state
banking
system
through
the
fdic
insurance
system,
or
through
the
national
banks
through
the
comptroller's
regulatory
authority,
and
it
would
have
to
be
with
the
permission
of
both
agencies
before
they
could
return.
in
addition
to
which,
the
comptroller
proposed
civil
penalties
of
$100,000
against
mr.
hudson
and
$50,000
each
against
the
other
two
petitioners,
messrs.
baresel
and
rackley.
now,
these
sentences
were
imposed
pursuant
to
a
statutory
scheme
that,
unlike
some,
for
these
sections...
for
these
section
required
timing
rules
that
there
be
willful
acts
and
the
administrator
then
considered
whether
it
is
repetitive,
whether
there
is
concealment,
questions
of
bad
faith
and
so
forth.
with
regard
to
that
scheme
those
findings
were
met
here,
remain
here
and
are
in
the
record.
the
statutes
do
not
contain
any
authority
for
the
administrative
agencies
to
consider
matters
such
as
internal
investigatory
costs,
expenses
incurred
in
investigating
the
bankers,
or
other
similar
matters,
nor
did
the
government
contend
at
any
time
that
it
had
suffered
quantifiable
monetary
loss
for
which
this
sanctions,
these
bonds
were
some
sort
of
recompense.
at
no
time
did
the
oc...
did
occ
ever
take
such
a
position.
in
1992,
the
petitioners
were
indicted
for
the
same
18
loans,
the
only
difference
being
that
there
is
one
conspiracy
count
in
the
indictment.
however,
it
is
important
to
note
that
the
comptroller
purported
to
find
that
these
were
acts
done
by
the
petitioners
together,
and
that
the
statutes
under
which
he
imposed
his
sanctions
allowed
that
to
be
considered
in
the
penalty.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
your
honor,
if
the
blockburger
test
applies,
then
it
applies
at
the
level
of
generality
that
the
government
seeks.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
well,
but
your
honor--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--i
suppose,
stated
that
abstractly,
we
might
not,
but
our
views
on
that
point
is
twofold.
first,
the
court
has
never
applied
that
type
of
analysis
in
this
case,
in
this
type
of
case,
whether
it's
a
civil--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--proceeding,
and
the
use
of
the
language
same
transaction
repeatedly
appears
to
me
not
to
be
an
accident,
because
particularly
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--i
think
it
makes
sense
to
say,
when
we're
talking
about
introducing
punishment
upon
a
particular
individual
for
allegedly
getting
involved
with
an
insider
loan
transaction,
that
the
same
insider
loan
transaction
should
not
be
punished
twice
in
separate
proceedings,
and
to
that
extent,
the
cases
upon
which
the
court
relied
in
lafranca,
justice
miller's
opinion
on
circuit
in
the
mckee
case,
and
the
opinion
of
the
southern
district
of
new
york
in
the
gates
case
support
that
view,
and
i
think
clearly
those
two
cases
and
probably
halper
itself
can
come
out
differently
under
a
strict
blockburger
analysis,
so
i
do
think
the
court
has
taken
the
position.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
your
honor,
i
suppose
my
response
to
that
is,
blockburger
presupposes
this
elements
analysis,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
always
fits.
and
i
think
often
times
it
doesn't,
where
you
do
not
have...
where
you
have
the
penalty
problem,
if
you
determine
your
punishment
but
there's
not
necessarily
a
criminal
offense
associated
with
it.
for
example,
last
term's
decision
in
the
cfi
fabricators
case
the
court
determined
there
the
type
of
punishment,
penalty
for
failure
to
pay
a
tax.
that
did
not
mean
that
there
had
to
be
a
criminal
prosecution
or
that
the
criminal
process
had
to
be
invoked,
but
i
think
it
has
to
focus
on
the
realities
of
the
statutory
schemes
that
are
at
issue,
and
the
threshold
question,
is
this
punishment?
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
or
twice
punished.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
i
agree,
mr.
chief
justice,
where
there
are
two
criminal
prosecutions,
but
where,
as
here,
the
question,
the
first
question
is,
is
there
punishment
imposed
by--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--if
it
is
a
civil
penalty,
if
it
is
truly
civil.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
congress
said
this
was
a
civil
penalty,
that
is
how
they
cast
it,
but
it
is
our
view,
it
is
our
submission,
that
as
the
seventh
circuit
held
in
regard
to
an
almost
identical
worded
statute,
in
the
healy
case,
that
the
effect
here
is
necessarily
cumulative.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
your
honor,
i'm
not...
i
would
not
characterize
it
as
a
strain
to
say
that
it's
criminal.
the
court,
the
court
has
not
said
it
was
criminal.
in
cases
going
back
as
far
as
choteau
in
the
1880s.
helwig
in
the
1900's,
which
is
cited
and
quoted
in
the
cfi
case,
in
each
of
those
cases
the
court
held
that
the
statutory
scheme
there
imposed
punishment.
in
none
of
them,
or
at
least
not
in
most
of
them,
was
that
made
in
the
context
of
a
criminal
proceeding.
it
was
found
to
be
the
effect
of
what
had
been
done
to
the
defendant.
and
what
has
been
done
here
in
our
case
is
punitive,
and
let
me
add--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--no,
sir.
no,
sir...
well,
chouteau
was.
helwig
was
the
case
in
which
jurisdiction
in
the
court
is
at
the
time
was
divided
between
the
district
and
circuit
courts.
if
it
was
civil
it
went
to
the
district
court,
it
was
criminal
it
went
to
the
circuit
court,
and
the
court
held
since
it
was
criminal
the
district
court
had
no
jurisdiction.
and
let
me
add
another
point
here
with
regard
to
the
nature
of
this
proceeding.
this
proceeding
is
slightly
different
than
many
of
the
regulatory
enforcement
actions
brought
by
various
government
agencies,
because
they,
many
of
them
rest
upon
pure
negligence,
or
upon
a
standard
of
conduct
of
less
than
knowing
the
rule
for
misconduct.
that
is
not...
that
happens
not
to
be
true
here,
at
least
under
the
statute
as
it
was
written
prior
to
the
1981
amendments,
and
if
the
court
will
look
on
page
62,
i
believe,
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition,
the
comptroller's
office
says.
second,
these
statutes...
this
is
true
from
the
legislative
history
that
is
in
our
brief,
it's
true
for
similar
statutes.
these
statutes
have
come
into
existence
on
the
premise
that
what
will
happen
here,
what
in
fact
happened
here
wouldn't
have
happened,
that
what
was
needed
was
a
lesser
penalty
so
that
the
criminal
process
did
not
have
to
be
invoked.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
well,
halper
is
certainly
an
important
decision
for
our
position,
i
believe
because
it
is
the
first
time
that
the
court
announced
categorically
that
the
constitution's
double
jeopardy
clause
could
apply
in
a
civil
proceeding.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
yes,
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
that
is
correct.
we
do
not
claim
vindictive
prosecution.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
with
regard
to
the--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--well,
your
honor,
as
to
the
first
part
of
your
question,
a
rare
case,
this
too,
is
an
unusual
case.
it
would
be
an
unusual
case
where
the
government
will
elect
to
try
and
claim
both
severe
administrative
sanctions
and
criminal--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--your
honor,
the
only
point
i
was
making
was
at
least
within
the
federal
system,
careful
coordination
between
the
sec
and
the
justice
department,
1940's
in
the
justice
department,
bringing
civil
and
criminal
proceedings
is
the
norm
today.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
perhaps
rarity
is
the
wrong
word.
the
distinguishing
factor
in
halper
was
that
part
of
the
sanction
there
admitted
to
be
obtained
as
remedial.
the
problem
was
determining
how
much
more,
at
what
point
along
a
continuum
did
that
$2,000
for
each
false
claim
penalty
become
penal,
if
at
all?
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
that's
correct.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
no
matter
which
one
come
first.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
i
don't
run
around
that.
i
don't
run
around
it.
i
say,
i
believe
that
is
a
correct
statement,
that
the
order
of
the
proceedings
does
not
matter.
if,
for
example,
in
the
case
in
which
there
has
been
a
civil
punishment
imposed,
say
this
is
the
cfi
federal
case,
if
thereafter
on
the
same
facts
there
had
been
an
attempt
to
indict,
and
say,
well,
the
defendant
would
at
least
in
my
judgment
have
a
strong
argument,
that
once
this
court
had
determined
this
was
punishment,
that
he
could
not
be
further
punished
in
a
separate
proceeding.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
i
think
one
of
the
most
useful
precedents
would
be
the
hicks
case,
in
view
of
the
distinctions
between
civil
and
criminal
intent,
is
it
a
determinate
or
indeterminate
sentence.
if,
for
example,
to
take
a
hypothetical
out
of
the
reply
brief,
if
the
petitioners
had
been
ordered
to
make
a
capital
contribution
to
make
up
capital
impairment
and
given
a
specific
amount
of
time
to
do
it,
and
thereafter,
if
you
didn't,
impose
a
certain
fine
there
will
be
a
strong
argument,
as
i
read
justice
white's
opinion
in
hicks,
that
that
is
an
indeterminate
and
therefore
remedial
sanction.
another
question--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--because
i
think,
in
answer
to
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
provides
a
useful
standard
for
answering
the
question
which
justice
ginsburg
asked.
and
that
is,
how
do
you
know...
how
is
one
to
determine
which
is
which?
another--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--your
honor,
the
unsophisticated
mind
might,
but
congress
having
chosen
to
use
the
word
penalty
in
different
contexts,
it
is
simply
a
fact
which
exists
in
the
united
states
code.
and
as
i
read
this
court's
cases
from
chouteau
forward,
that
cannot
affect
the
fourth
principle--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--and
we're
being
penalized
for
something
we
did
in
the
past,
after
having
been
told
we
can
no
longer
participate
in
the
business
of
banking,
it
would
be
different.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
yes,
i
think
there
can.
for
example,
if
the
government
has
suffered...
in
the
example
of
a
false
claim,
if
the
government
has
suffered
an
economic
measurable
financial--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--your
honor,
i
would
not
take
credit
for...
process
of
law--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
your
honor,
in
the
first
place,
i...
two
points.
the
first
one
is,
at
the
very
least,
congress
should
enact
it.
and
this
statute,
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination,
directs
or
allows
the
administrator
to
consider
that
action.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
from
what
congress
has
said,
you
can
determine
that
it
did
not
authorize
consideration
of
government
costs,
and
second--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--well,
your
honor,
it
says,
in
considering
the
amount
of
the
fine,
and
then
lists
the
criteria.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
they
are
in
the
statute,
and
then
the
occ
has
expanded
on
through
what
is
called
the
penalty
matrix,
which
has
a
series
of
points,
functioning
like
the
sentencing
guidelines,
but
the
criteria
as
to
what
must
be
considered
statutory.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
and
the
second
point
i
would
make
on
that
issue
is
that
we
are
not
talking
about
costs
in
the
sense
of
obtaining
expert
witnesses
or
something
like
that.
what
the
government
was
attempting
to
do
here
is
to
say
they
could
simply
take
the
cost
of
operation.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
and
that
clearly
is
not
what
happened.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
as
a
general
matter,
certainly
if
congress
speaks
to
it,
that's
one
thing.
if
congress
doesn't
speak,
and
if
it
is
simply
a
matter
allocating
the
cost
of
government
to
someone
to
defeat
a
double
jeopardy
claim,
i
think
that's
very
problematic.
in
the
walter
case
in
the
ninth
circuit
i
think
judge
noonan
said
that
this
case
makes
a
strong
point,
that
on
that
theory
no
private
individual
has
that
much
money.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
your
honor,
i'm
not...
i
don't
think
in
order
to
resolve
this
case
in
my
client's
favor
it
is
necessary
to
say
that
statutes
such
as
this
are
no
good.
we
are
saying
that
in
this
instance
the
use
of
the
statutes
resulted
in
punishment.
i
would
point
out--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
exact
number
off-hand,
but
i--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--that--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--well--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--your
honor,
with
regard
to
your
last
point,
we
do
not
argue
that
the
nonparticipation
sanctions
appease.
we
argue
that,
given
the
nonparticipation,
that
with
imposition
on
top
of
that
a
fixed
monetary
sums
as
a
penalty
for
completed
acts
can
have
no
remedial
nonremedial
purpose.
if
my
client
had
been
allowed
to
continue
in
the
industry,
and
it
had
been
determined
that
they
had
caused
x
amount
of
loss,
then
if
the
question--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--well,
your
honor,
that's
possible
i
suppose.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
but
it
was
not
the
intent
with
which
they
were
imposed.
the
intent,
according
to
the
occ,
in
its
published
order,
was...
repeated
at
the
hearing
before
judge
thompson,
was
to
deter
others
through
publicizing
this
order.
now,
making
of
my
clients
an
example
in
order
to
deter
third
parties
is
a
classic
definition
of
punishment
regardless
of
what--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--i
agree
with
that,
but
there
has
not
been
any
suggestion
thus
far
that
there
was
any
divergence
between
the
two.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
if
i
could--
[laughter]
--i
would
like
to
reserve...
i'm
sorry,
sir.
i
didn't--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--i
was
going
to
say,
i'll
reserve
time,
but
if
i
missed
a
question,
i
apologize.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
with
regard
to
the
order
of
proceedings,
i
would
note
the
obvious.
that
is
up
to
the
government.
if
it
wishes
to
bring
a
criminal
prosecution
first,
it
may
do
so,
and
as
a
practical
matter,
whenever
there
is
a
belief
that...
on
the
part
of
the
government
that
that
kind
of
dual
proceeding
will
be
forthcoming,
there's
traditionally
very
close
coordination,
reflected,
for
example,
in
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
the
courts
of
appeals
regarding
the
rights
of
a
litigant
to
civil
discovery
while
the
grand
jury
is
still
sitting.
with
regard
to
the
eighth
amendment
issue,
it
may
be
that
the
eighth
amendment
also
would
apply,
but
that
is
not
an
exclusive
application.
it
is
our
position
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
under
this
court's
cases
apply
to
a
statute
such
as
this,
which
imposes
punishment
on
solely
punitive
or
traditionally
punitive
criteria
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
expounded
by
the
administrator
called
upon
to
do
so
in
a
matrix,
as
it
is
called,
that
is
self-consciously
patterned
on
the
federal
criminal
sentencing
guidelines.
mr.

rothbaum
if
the
person
is
allowed
to
go
to
the
meeting
after
he
pays
the
fine,
that
might
very
well
be
a
remedial
imposition.
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
your
honor,
i
know
of
no
such
statute--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--i
understand
that.
your
honor,
the
difficulty
i
have
with
your
question
is
that
this
statute
and
these
criteria
are
so
specific--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--well,
when
one
measures
the
size
of
the
fine
according
to
whether
it's
a
recidivism,
and
according
to
whether--
mr.
bernard
j.
rothbaum
--but
it
must
also
be
an
intentional
act,
at
least
under
the
statute
as
it
then
existed,
and
with
regard
to
that
point,
and
where
to
draw
the
line
on
what
is
and
isn't
a
penalty,
i
would
invite,
if
i
could,
the
court's
attention
to
one
of
the
first
cases
in
this
area,
chouteau,
which
held
that
first
a
settlement
agreement
would
be
treated
as
being
the
equivalent
of
a
criminal
acquittal
or
conviction
so
that
the
defendant
could
plead
double
jeopardy,
saying
that
otherwise
a
great
principle
would
be
sacrificed
to
mere
form,
and
second,
that
the
mode
by
which
the
penalty
was
imposed
did
not
matter,
whether
by
a
civil
action
or
a
criminal
prosecution.
a
unanimous
court
repeated
that
holding
in
la
franca,
and
i
think
the
point
of
la
franca,
in
distinguishing
between
the
penalty
and
the
tax
issue,
it
must
serve
some
other
purpose.
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
point
of
ursery.
in
addition
to
the
historical,
unique...
thank
you,
your
honor.
