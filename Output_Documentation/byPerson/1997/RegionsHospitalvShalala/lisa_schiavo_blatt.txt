mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
gme
amendment
ties
future
reimbursements
for
graduate
medical
education
expenses
to
1984
costs.
to
implement
that
new
payment
system,
the
secretary
adopted
a
regulation
to
ensure
an
accurate
computation
of
those
base
year
costs.
this
regulation
was
designed
to
prevent
mistakes
from
being
cemented
and
perpetuated
into
all
future
medicare
reimbursements.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
3-year
period
expired,
the
secretary
can
no
longer
recoup
that
money,
but
what's
at
issue
here
is
the
implementation
of
the
statute
in
which,
if
there
are
errors
that
the
secretary
cannot
recoup,
the
secretary
does
not
want
to
prevent
them
from
being
forever
enshrined
into
all
payments.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
and
if
the
secretary
had--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--had
promulgated
the
rule
earlier,
then
you
would
have
had
the
re-audit
within
the
3-year
window,
and
you
would
have
been
able
to
recoup
the
money,
but
this
regulation
by
and
large
for
most
hospitals
missed
that
3-year
window.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
justice
scalia,
but
the
issue
is
whether
the
language
is
consistent
with
what
the
secretary
did.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
and
in
this
case
the
statute
directs
the
secretary
to
determine
an
average
amount
recognized
as
reasonable
under
the
act
for
gme
costs
per
resident.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
the
word
recognized
under
the
act,
to
us
the
most
natural
reading
of
that
language
is,
it's
the
costs
that
are
regarded
by
the
statute,
acknowledged
or
regarded
or
deemed
by
the
statute
as
allowable,
and
we
think
the
actual...
actually,
two
points.
this
statute
does
not
say
the
secretary
shall
determine
an
average
amount
previously
determined.
it
doesn't
use
the
word
determined.
it
says,
recognized.
nor
does
it
refer
to
section
1395oo,
which
refers
to
a
fiscal
intermediary's
determination.
nor
does
it
say,
the
amount
previously
reimbursed.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
it
says
recognized
as
reasonable.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
some
of
them,
you
hadn't
even...
you
might
not
have
even
had
a
notice
of
program
reimbursement--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--by
april
of
1986.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
but
the
point,
justice
stevens,
is
that
recognized
as
reasonable
in
our
reading
of
the
statute
refers
to
the
substantive
standard
of
allowability
under
the
act
during
the
base
year.
it's
simply
silent
as
to
the
process
by
which
the
secretary
should
make
the
determination
of
the
per-resident
average,
and
the
secretary
had
longstanding--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
i
think
what
congress
wanted
was
the
actual...
the
payment
system
to
be
based
on
an
accurate
amount,
and
there
is
only
one
accurate
amount,
and
the
problem
was,
when
the
secretary
promulgated
her
regulation,
at
least
proposed
in
1988,
she
realized
that
substantial
overpayments
had
been
made
for
this
educational
program,
and
she
cited
many
examples.
the
secretary
was
also
concerned
that
there
had
been
inconsistent
treatment
in
the
costs,
and
they
had
not
been
given
sufficient
scrutiny,
and
to
prevent
those
costs,
or
those
errors,
rather,
from
being
perpetuated
into
all
future
reimbursements,
she
felt
it
was
important...
i
guess
it
was
he
at
the
time...
to--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i
don't
think
the
statute
speaks
to
this
at
all,
justice
stevens.
i
think
it's
completely
silent
as
to
the
process.
it's
clear
that
congress
wanted
an
accurate
amount,
and
it
wanted
the
per-resident
average
to
be
reasonable,
and
we
read
that
as
reasonable
under
the
substantive
standards
that
were
in
effect
during
the
base
year,
and
the
secretary
read
that
language
to
permit
her
to
calculate
the
per-resident
average
based
on
an
accurate
amount.
i
just
don't
think
the...
neither
the
legislative
history
nor
the
text
addresses
this,
and
presumably
congress
was
also
aware
that
the
secretary
could
amend
her
regulations,
and
that's
what
she
did
here.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
i
think
the
former
description
was
accurate.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
you
get
a...
excuse
me.
the
hospital
periodically
gets
paid
throughout
the
year
as
it
incurs
the
cost.
there's
a
year-end
book-balancing
just
based
on
what
the
hospital
claims
as
its
cost.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
then
sometimes
2
and
sometimes
even
3
years
later
there's
a
notice
of
program
reimbursement.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
you're
correct
in
that
the
amount
of
money
had
been
reimbursed,
but
you
use
the
word
recognized
as
having
the
same
meaning--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--as
a
determination,
and
we
don't
read
it--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it
could
be...
that
could
be
one
reading
of
the
word
recognized,
but
equally
in
fact
we
think
a
more
persuasive
reading
of
the
word
recognized
is
recognized
by
the
statute,
not
determined
by
a
fiscal
intermediary.
congress
could
have
easily
have
said,
come
up
with
an
amount
previously
reimbursed,
or
previously
determined,
or
it
could
have
said,
previously
determined
under
the
secretary's
existing
regulations,
or
determined
under
1395oo,
which
refers
to
a
fiscal
intermediary's
determination
of
the
amount
of
reimbursement
due.
it
just
said,
recognized
as
reasonable.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct,
justice
scalia,
but
the
d.c.
circuit
in
tulane
cited
two
cases,
two
instances
in
which
the
statute
does
use
the
term,
recognized
as
reasonable.
it's
just
that
there
it
had
a
word
previously
in
one
instance
and
it
had
a
to
be
in
another
instance,
which
we
think
simply
highlights
the
flexibility
and
the
ambiguity
in
this
term.
it
just
says,
recognized
as...
an
amount
recognized
as
reasonable.
it
doesn't
say
an
amount
that
was,
an
amount
that
is,
an
amount
to
be,
an
amount
previously,
and
it's
more
of
a...
it's
silent
as
to
the
process
by
which
the
secretary
would
make
this
determination.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
thank
you,
justice
souter.
i
mean,
we're...
that
would...
we're
clearly
asking
for
deference
here.
you
don't
have
to
agree,
but
we
happen
to
think
that
it
is
the
better
reading
of
the
statute.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
justice
ginsburg,
several
responses.
first
of
all,
we
don't
think
the
statute
addresses
this,
but
it
might
well
be
irrational
or
arbitrary
if
the
secretary
subjected
hospitals
to
perpetual
re-audits.
there
would
also
have
to
be
an
articulated
reason
for
doing
it.
i
mean,
what
the
secretary
did
here
is
said
we
want
to
make
a
one-time...
clear-the-slate,
one-time
determination
of
this
average-per-resident
amount,
and
she
promulgated
a
rule
to
do
that.
i
don't
know
any
reason
why
the
secretary
would
do
it
again,
maybe
if
there
was
fraud,
and
then
she
wouldn't
even
need
to
promulgate
a
regulation.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
again,
that
first...
when
it
was
paid
originally
in
1984,
justice
stevens,
the
only
risk
associated
with
errors
was
the
amount
of
reimbursement
that
provider
was
due
in
1984.
when
the
statute
got
amended
to
base
all
future
payments
on
an
equal
cost--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--that's
true,
and
the
price
that
the
secretary
paid
for
not
acting
quickly
is,
she
cannot
go
back
and
recoup
the
money.
i
mean,
that
did
not
hurt
the
hospitals.
what
the
secretary's
trying
to
do
is
to
prevent
future--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--and
if
she
doesn't
have
a
good
reason,
it
would
be
arbitrary.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
but
justice
stevens--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--but
justice
stevens,
the
secretary
went
into
this
round
to
make
this
per-resident
determination
knowing
the
point
of
it,
and
it
would...
i
just
can't
imagine
a
situation
where
the
secretary
would
say,
okay,
i
need
to
do
this
every
2
years,
but
if
she
did
articulate
a
reason
it
would
be
judged
based
on
the
information
the
secretary
had
in
front
of
her,
and
whether
that
was
reasonable.
i'd
like
to
just
briefly
address
two
things
that
petitioner
said
about
whether
hospitals
were
on
notice
of
the
need
to
retain
records.
the
same
page
that
petitioner
quotes,
which
was
53
federal
register
36,592,
says
three
extremely
important
things
to
hospitals,
and
this
was
within
the
time,
within
the
4-year
period
under
any
kind
of
scenario
in
which
you...
the
hospitals
were
permitted
to
discard
physician
allocation--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
it
was
50--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
he
just
said
it
a
minute
ago
in
his
argument,
that--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--so
it's
not
cited
in
the
brief.
it's
what
the
district
court
in
samaritan
health
systems
relied
on
to
say
hospitals
had
notice.
it
cites
this
federal
register
cite.
but
the
three
things
were
very
simple.
the
secretary
warned
hospitals
that
a
re-audit
would
be
conducted
to
exclude
misclassified
and
unallowable
cost.
it
said...
and
most
critically
it
said,
appropriate
supporting
documentation...
the
fiscal
intermediaries
would
look
at...
would
ask
for
appropriate
supporting
documentation
where
costs
seemed
questionable,
and
3),
equally
importantly
it
said,
we
can't...
the
secretary
indicated
that
she
could
not
guarantee
any
time
frame
in
which
this
re-audit
activity
would
be
completed
because
of
budgetary
constraints
on
contractors.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i
think
september
21,
1988.
let
me
check
on
that.
yes,
september
21,
1988,
and
under
petitioner's
year,
his...
its
cost
year
ended
december
'88.
the--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--it
said,
where
costs
seemed
questionable.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
i
mean,
i
read
it
as
quite
general.
it
said,
as
indicated.
so
that
was
clear
notice,
and
it's
also...
we
think
the
secretary
reasonably
believed
that
hospitals
would
have
retained
records,
and
certainly
this
case
doesn't
involve
an
as-applied
challenge
where
a
hospital
has
presented
evidence
that
it
discarded
records,
and
on
that...
that's
on
that
issue,
although
petitioner
has
said
there's...
that
the
hospital
was
prejudiced.
the
petitioner
did
challenge
this
re-audit
for
3
years,
but
then
withdrew
all
of
its
challenges
in
1994,
and
we
think
that
is
quite
significant.
and
moreover,
the...
it
wasn't
a
default
rule
applied
to
the
disallowance.
there
was
a
[dollars]
4
million
difference,
and
the
reason
that
was
so
significant
was,
most
of
this
did
result
from
the
fact
that
petitioner
had
records
from
1984,
and
those
records
showed
that
administrative
costs
had
been
paid
when
they
weren't
related
to
educational.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i'm
not
sure
how
to
answer
that
question.
the...
if
the
costs
were
misallocated--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
if...
but
let
me--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--the
1984...
the
problem
in
1984
was
that
the
government
paid
too
much.
it's...
if
you
talk
about
reclass--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
i
think
it's...
if
the
costs
were
counted
as
educational,
but
they
should
have
been
operating,
and
there
were
caps
on
operating
costs
in
effect
during
that
year,
and
they
were
paid
on
a
pass-through
reasonable
cost
basis,
and
so
the
government
paid
too
much.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
oh,
yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes.
i'm...
yes,
definitely,
and
the
interesting
thing
about
that
is,
the
complaints
about
the
hospital-specific
rate
and
the
federal
rate
all
could
have
been
lodged
had
the
secretary
originally
caught
these
errors
in
1984,
or
had
promulgated
a
rule
within
the
3-year
window.
you
would
still
have
problems
about
what
to
do
about
prior
year
classification,
and
we
think
the
secretary
quite
reasonably
allowed
hospitals
to
not
only
increase
their
rates
for
operating
costs,
but
one
thing...
and
in
conclusion,
i'd
like
to
point
this
out.
the
regulation
actually
allowed
hospitals
to
increase
their
gme
amounts,
and
our
records
reflect
that
approximately
30
percent
of
hospitals
raised
their
amounts.
obviously,
more
often
than
not
the
amounts
went
down,
but
there
were
a
significant
number
of
hospitals
where
the
costs
went
up.
if
there
are
no
more
questions--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--yes.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct,
and
ironically,
justice
breyer,
the
petitioner
did
present
subsequent
year
data,
i
think
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
because
the
time
records
did
not
break...
this
is
the
very
same
issue
we're
talking
about.
this
petitioner
had
time
records
in
1984
which
are
very
detailed
documents,
but
because
the
petitioner
on
the
face
of
the
time
records
did
not
break
down
the
costs
between
teaching
medical
students
versus
teaching
residents,
they
were
allowed
to
use
a
new
time
study,
and
that's
why
there
was
a
settlement
in
this
case
and
the
petitioner
actually
got
an
increase
in
the
per-resident
average.
so
petitioner
used
that
equitable
relief
in
this
case,
even
though...
and
that's
not
because
petitioner
threw
away
records.
it's
because
petitioner
never
had
the
records
to
begin
with.
there's
just
simply
nothing
in
the
record,
at
least
that
we
could
draw
any
conclusion
that
there
were
records
thrown
away.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
it
might,
justice
scalia,
but
it
would...
it
certainly
goes
against
petitioner's
reading
of
the
statute,
which
is
that
congress
assumed
the
secretary
had
a
3-year
window
under
these
regulations,
which
would
have
been
in
1989,
and
there's
simply
no
way
that
could
have
been
done
under
this
reporting
requirement.
but
this
statute
is
a
reporting
requirement,
and
there
were
several
reporting
requirements
imposed
on
the
secretary
in
this
very
bill,
but
even
if
you
read
this
reporting
requirement
as
a
mandate
for
the
secretary
to
do
something
by
a
date
certain,
i
don't
think
you
should
read
in
a
congressional
intent
that
the
secretary
lacks
the
power
to
act
beyond
that
statutory
deadline.
and
one
more
point.
the...
it
would
have
been
extremely
difficult
for
the
secretary
to
have
promulgated
and
finalized
a
rule,
made
an
evaluation,
and
reported
to
the
secretary
by
december
of
'87
under...
in
all
events.
