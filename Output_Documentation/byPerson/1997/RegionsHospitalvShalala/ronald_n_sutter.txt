mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
a
straightforward
question
of
statutory
construction.
at
issue
is
the
meaning
of
42
u.s.c.
1395ww(h)(2)(a),
which
is
quoted
on
page
19
of
petitioner's
opening
brief.
as
the
sixth
circuit
correctly
concluded
in
the
toledo
case,
this
is
a
simple
statute.
it
directs
the
secretary
to
do
one
thing.
it
directs
the
secretary
to
determine
an
average,
nothing
more.
the
numerator
in
this
case
is
the
amount
recognized
as
reasonable
under
this
subchapter
for
gme
costs
for
1984.
the
statute
itself
does
not
direct
the
secretary
to
determine
the
numerator,
and
the
reason
why
is
clear
from
the
words,
under
this
subchapter.
the
statute
does
not
say,
under
this
section,
or
under
this
paragraph,
but
it
says,
under
this
subchapter,
and
there
was
already
a
longstanding
process
in
place
for
determining
the
amount
recognized
as
reasonable
for
each
year,
including
1984.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
i
think
when
you're
referring
to
an
average,
determine
and
calculate
are
essentially
equivalent,
and
there
are,
mr.
chief
justice,
within
1395ww(h)
other
provisions
where
it's
clear
that
congress
did
intend
to
confer
significant
authority
on
the
secretary.
one
such
provision
is
1395ww(h)(2)(e),
which
is
on
page
3
of
petitioner's
appendix.
i
will
use
ellipses
here,
but
there
it
says,
in
the
case
of
a
hospital
that
did
not
have
an
approved
medical
residency
training
program,
ellipses,
during
fiscal
year
1984,
the
secretary
shall,
ellipses,
provide
for
such
approved
fte
resident
amount
as
the
secretary
determines
to
be
appropriate.
now,
this
is
language
that
does
clearly
grant
the
secretary
discretion.
here
we
have
activist
language.
in
(a),
the
provision
we're
dealing
at...
with,
the
congress
was
telling
the
secretary,
divide
a
by
b,
divide
one
number
by
another.
there
is
also,
if--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
there
are
a
number
of
reasons,
but
one
is
that
there
is
one,
and
only
one
statutory
provision
in
the
medicare
subchapter
that
does
provide
for
recognizing
an
amount
as
reasonable,
and
that
is
42
u.s.c.
1395oo
(a),
which
we
have
quoted
at
pages
11
and
12
of
petitioner's
appendix.
the
relevant
language
is
at
the
top
of
page
12,
which
refers
to
a
final
determination,
which
we
know
as
the
notice
of
program
reimbursement
for
the
npr,
as
to
the
amount
of
total
program
reimbursement
due
the
provider
for
the
items
and
services
for
which
payment
may
be
made
under
this
subchapter
for
the
period
covered
by
such
report.
the
words
that
are
used
in
the
gme
statute
is,
amount
recognized
as
reasonable
under
this
subchapter.
here
in
1395oo(a)
we
have
a
specific
amount,
it
is
recognized
as
reasonable...
that
is,
there's
a
final
determination
of
program
reimbursement...
it
is
specifically
under
this
subchapter,
and
it's
specifically
for
a
period.
this
is
a
very
important
provision
in
the
medicare
subchapter,
and
in
fact
is
one
that
this
court
has
seen
before
in
the
bethesda
hospital
association
case
decided
in
1988.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
i
do...
i
think
the
timing
here
would
preclude
that,
because
cobra
9202(e),
which
we
have
cited
at
page
6
of
our
reply
brief,
clearly
reflects
that
congress
intended
these
amounts
to
be
established
by
1987.
that
was
well
within
the
reopening
period
for
1984
in
all
cases.
there's
no
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
have
two
amounts.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
oh,
i
agree
with
you.
they
would.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
and
i
think
there's
every
reason
to
believe
that
we
do
have
the
right
figure
here.
we
have--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--i
think
that
avoids
a
potential
question
as
to
whether
the
lower
cost
or
charges
principle
applies.
under
reasonable
cost
standards--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--sure.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
there
has
been
only
one
figure
recognized
as
reasonable,
but
in
certain
cases
that
may
not
have
been
what
was
actually
paid
and
the
reason
why
is
that,
under
42
u.s.c.
1395f(b),
a
hospital
got
paid
the
lower
of
its
reasonable
cost
or
its
customary
charges.
now,
in
almost
all
cases
the
reasonable
costs
would
be
lower,
but
there
could
be
cases
where
the
customary
charges
were
lower,
and
to
avoid
any
ambiguity
the
words,
as
reasonable
make
clear
that
you're
looking
at
the
amount
that
was
recognized
as
reasonable--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--well,
that's
in
the
statute.
that's
42
u.s.c.
1395f(b).
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that's
my
interpretation.
that's
why
i
think
it's
important
to
have
the
words,
as
reasonable.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
i
think
in
this
case,
in
light
of
cobra
9202(e),
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
the
per-resident
amount
to
be
established
by
1987,
which
was
well
within
the
existing
reopening
period,
and
i
think
prompt
implementation
was
very
important,
just
as
in
the
case
of--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--you
mean
that
was
a
general
period
for
all
years?
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
as
we
pointed
out
in
footnote
8
of
our
reply
brief,
the
current
reopening
regulation
is
a
pretty
broad
construction
of
the
statute,
but
you
would
certainly
have
a
very
different
case
here.
our
case
is
based
upon
the
fact
that
there
was
an
amount
recognized
as
reasonable
under
this
subchapter,
and
the
secretary
is
not
using
that
amount.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
we
would...
yes.
we
would
say
there
needs
to
be
uniformity,
and
whatever's
the
final
determination
for
1984,
that
is
the
amount
that
would
be
used
for
purposes
of
this
average,
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
i
don't
think
so
in
this
case
because
of
cobra
9202(e).
that
clearly
reflected
congress'
intent
that
this
would
be
established
by
1987,
and
in
any
event--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--if
it
expected
to
be
done
by
1987,
which
congress
made
clear
that
it
did,
i
think
it
would...
it
did
that,
yes.
i
mean,
this
is
a
rate
system.
it's
not
a
retrospective
payment
system
like
reasonable
cost,
and
one
of
the
important
things
for
a
rate
is
that
they
be
set
in
advance
so
that
everyone
knows
what
the
rate's
going
to
be
and
so
that
you
have
predictability.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes,
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
determine
the
average.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
it
said
you
shall
determine
the
average,
and
the
amount
recognized.
in
the
normal
course
the
amount
recognized
for
'84
will
be
done
before
you
actually
determine
the
average,
just
because
'84
preceded
the
first
year
subject
to
payment
under
the
new
methodology
by
2
years.
in
petitioner's
case,
the
first
year
was
'86,
that
they
would
be
subject
to
payment
under
the
new
methodology,
and
the
base
year
would
be
'84.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
no.
it
is
a--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
it's
the
average--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--for
each
resident,
but
what
you
would
have,
when
you
have
the
npr
you
would
have
with
it
an
audited
cost
report
that
would
give
you
an
aggregate
figure
for
gme.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
so
you
would
take
that
figure,
whatever
it
is,
and
divide
it
by
your
number
of
residents--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--and
that's
what
you'd
get
as
your
number.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes,
that's
correct,
so
the
secretary
shall
determine
the
average,
that's
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
but
the
amount
recognized
as
reasonable
under
this
subchapter
is
always
determined
as...
in
the
normal
course,
and
the
language
here
is
very
similar
to
the
same
language
that
we
had
in
the
prospective
payment
system
for
operating
costs
in...
for
tefra.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
but
the
secretary
was
directed
to
compute
the
average.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
because
you
see
that
there's
an
average
if
you
look
at
42
u.s.c.
1395ww(a)(4),
which
defines
all
of
that
in
terms
of
average.
so
the
term
that
you're
looking
at,
and
looking
at
what
the
target
amount
is,
doesn't
use
the
word
average,
but
it
keys
into
an
average
when
you
look
at
(a)(4),
which
requires
that
it's
an
average
amount,
in
that
case
per
discharge,
and
in
this
case
it's
per
resident.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
okay.
well,
essentially
what
happened
in
this
case
is,
a
great
portion
of
that
is
attributable
to
the
time
that
the
physicians
reported
as
administrative
time.
that
is,
during
'84
they
completed
time
studies,
and
one
of
the
categories
was
for
administrative
time
that
was
always
claimed
and
always
allowed
as
gme.
in
the
re-audit
the
intermediary
applied
a
default
rule
and
said,
well,
your
administrative
time
could
have
been
administrative
time
for
gme,
or
it
could
have
been
administrative
time
for
operating
purposes.
we
must
look...
we
must
see
actual
data
from
'84,
or
we're
just
going
to
apply
an
ad
hoc
default
rule,
and
that's
what
occurred
in
this
case.
that...
either
directly
or
indirectly,
that
accounts
for
about
90
percent
of
the
differential
here.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
i
believe
that
to
be
the
case.
i
would
also
say
that
during
'84
itself
no
breakdown
was
required,
and--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--well,
we...
in
the
record
we
have...
there
is
the
audit
adjustment
report
which
shows
that
these
are
recharacterizations--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--of
costs.
they're
not...
they
weren't
disallowances
of
costs.
they
were
recharacterizations
of
cost
from
gme
to
operating--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--we
haven't
really
focused
on
that
because
we're
really
focusing
on
the
threshold
question
here,
which
is,
did
the
secretary
have
the
authority
to
re-audit.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
we
haven't
focused
on
the
individual
facts
because
we
are--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--yes,
i
think
that's
correct,
but
we
are
looking
at
whether
the
secretary
had
the
authority
to
do
the
re-audit.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
no
they...
that
did,
in
fact,
happen
in
this
case.
i
mean,
we
had
a
total
turnover
of
the
reimbursement
department
between
1984
and
the
time
of
the
re-audit,
and
there
were
records
that
had
been
discarded.
that
did
happen
in
the
case,
but
i
have
not
been
focusing
on
this,
because
we're
really
looking
at
the
threshold
question,
which
is,
did
the
secretary
have
the
authority
to
do
this.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
we--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--yes.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
there's
two
answers.
first
of
all,
even
where
that
applies,
it's
not
fair,
and
secondly
it
doesn't
apply
here.
let
me
go
to
the
first.
they
allow
a
3-week
current
time
study
for
1990,
but
it's
skewed
to
the
secretary's
favor.
you
get
the
lower
two
numbers.
you
get
what
was
in
the
80...
1984
npr,
or
you
get
the
figure
in
the
time
study.
it's
also
a
figure
for
1990,
which
is
unrelated
to
what
we're
looking
for,
which
is
what
was
recognized
for
1984.
it
was
not
available
to
the
hospital
here
because
this
hospital
did
have
time
records
from
1984,
or
it
had
summaries.
the
problem
wasn't
the
time
records,
it
was...
the
problem
was
that
they
were
reinterpreted
by
the
secretary.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
they...
yes.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
they
had
a
choice.
they
could
have
proceeded
with
that.
it
would
have
been
difficult
because
the
personnel
had
turned
over
and
records
had
been
lost.
i
think
if
they
had
proceeded,
that
they
may
very
well...
i
think,
in
fact,
they
probably
would
have
won,
because
really
the
issue
they
had
here
is,
i
think,
the
same
as
an
issue
in
another
case
called
good
samaritan
hospital,
which
is
873
f.
supp.
at
1089-1092,
which
involved
this
administrative
time,
and
that
that
ruled
against
the
secretary
and
the
secretary
did
not
appeal.
but
they
elected
not
to
take
that
route.
they
elected
to
get
at
what
i
would
suggest
is
the
heart
of
the
matter,
which
is,
did
the
secretary
have
the
authority
to
re-audit,
and
if
the
secretary
didn't
have
the
authority
that
really
ends
the
matter.
as
far
as...
i
don't
see
that
it's
necessary
to
apply
any
presumption
here,
but
if
there
is
a
presumption
that
is
to
be
applied,
i
would
suggest
the
presumption
is
in
favor
of
the
final
and
binding
determination
that's
made
for
1984.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
perhaps,
but
i
think
we
have
clear
language
here,
and
i
think
we
also
have
the
fact
that
there
was
already
a
final
and
binding
determination,
and
there
is
a
presumption
in
favor
of
issue
preclusion,
and
there's
nothing
to
overcome
that
presumption
here.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
the...
well,
the
court
has
established
that
in
cases
such
as
astoria
federal,
and
here
we
have
a
final
and
binding
determination
for
1984.
hospitals
were
told
they
were
free
to
discard
their
records.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
well,
it
still
said
final
and
binding.
it
was
unqualified.
it
said
final
and
binding,
and--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--well,
it
was
the
same
thing
that
was
done
for
pps
in
tefra.
there,
congress
established
an...
a
rate
for
the
future
based
upon
a...
an
amount
recognized
under
the
subchapter
for
a
base
year,
and
the
secretary
used
the
same
amount,
and
it's
important--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--but
1986,
justice
ginsburg,
was
within
the
reopening
period
for
this
year.
i
mean,
we...
the...
in
some
cases
the
npr
had
not
even
been
issued
as
of
the
date
that
this
statute
was
enacted.
in
other--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--i
am...
yes.
i
mean,
there's...
there
has
to
be
uniformity.
it's
really
the
same
argument
that
i
made
in
the
pps
context
for
georgetown
ii,
and
that--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--i'm
saying
once
that
period
has
passed
you
are
not
going
to
get
an
accurate
result,
and
i'm
also
saying
that
these
results
were
accurate
because
they
were
audited
determinations,
done
by
experienced
intermediaries,
and
they
were
done
at
a
time
when
there
was
reason
to
be
careful
because
this
was
the
year
to
be
used
for
the--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--no,
we've
not
accepted
that.
we
simply
have
elected
instead
to
pursue
the
threshold
question.
mr.

which
is,
did
the--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that's
correct.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
they
can
ask,
but
that
doesn't
really
help.
it
doesn't
help
because
the
secretary's
not
changing
the
federal
rate,
which
is
the
primary
component
of
payment
under
pps.
it's
also
not
helping
in
many
cases
because
the
hospitals
have
to
have
documentation
from
1982,
which
many
of
them
no
longer
have.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
they
weren't
put
on
notice.
the
proposed
rule
indicated
that
there
might
be
some
reaudits
in
unspecified
circumstances,
but
it
nowhere
suggested
that
there
could
be
a
re-audit
after
the
3-year
period
had
expired.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
yes,
it
did.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
at
page
36,592
it
reiterated
the
normal
3-year
reopening
period
and
said
that
there
would
be
a
special
exception
to
make
conforming
amendments
for
purposes
of
the
hospital-specific
rate,
but
there...
but...
and
it
also
said
to
the
extent
there's
a
re-audit
those
will
be
begun
quickly,
before
any
final
rule
is
issued,
so
there
was
absolutely
nothing
in
there
that
suggested
that
there
would
be
some
sort
of
audit
done
after
expiration
of
the
3-year
period.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
but
that
wouldn't
apply
to
this
hospital,
because
it
did
have
the
'84
time
records.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
no,
no,
no.
we
didn't
have...
well,
we
had
the
time
records.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
and
the
time--
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
--right.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
that's
not
how
it
was
applied.
mr.
ronald
n.
sutter
if
you
had
the
time
records,
then
that's
what
they
used.
it
was
the
same
time
records
that
had
been
around
in
'84,
the
time
that
had
been
claimed
as
administrative
time
and
had
been...
that
had
been
claimed
as
gme,
and
that
had
been
allowed
as
gme,
and
the
re-audit
conducted
6
years
later,
the
intermediary
said,
well,
we're...
it's
not
based
upon
new
evidence.
they
just
said,
we're
going
to
apply
an
ad
hoc
default
rule,
and
also
you
cannot
do
a
current
time
study
because
there
are
the
records
from
1984.
