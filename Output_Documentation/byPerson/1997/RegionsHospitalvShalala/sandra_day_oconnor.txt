counsel,
i--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--i
also
have
a
question,
and
your
time
is
running
out,
and
i
did
want
to
ask
it.
i
take
it
that
what
happened
after
this
new
statute
was
passed
is
that
some
costs
were
reclassified--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--from
education
to
operating.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
think
there
is
a
regulation...
tell
me
if
that's
right...
that
hospitals
can
request
an
upward
adjustment
in
the
hospital-specific
rate
if
a
reaudit
results
in
the
reclassification
of
costs
as
operating
costs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
in
theory,
even
though
this
disastrous
thing
happened,
the
hospital
can
ask
for
an
upward
adjustment
in
the
rate.
