stephen
g.
breyer
--is
the
reason
you're
not
focusing
on
it
because...
is
the
reason,
is
one
reason
you're
not
focusing
on
it...
one
reason
because
you
conceded
it
out
of
the
case,
and
i
take
it
the
other
reason
is
because
they've
actually
promulgated
a
rule
that
states,
as
an
equitable
solution
to
the
problem
of
the
nonexistence
of
records,
we
are
allowing
providers
to
furnish
documentation
from
cost
reporting
periods
subsequent
to
the
base
period.
now,
am
i
wrong?
i've
looked
at
that.
i
tried
to
find
it.
you
did
mention
it
in
your
brief.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wanted
to
know
what
hhs
had
done
about
people
who'd
thrown
their
records
away,
and
my
law
clerk
found
this
rule.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
which
says,
they're
aware
of
the
problem
and
they're
going
to
be
fair
about
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now...
so
is
there
any
answer
to
this?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
what's
the
answer?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
also
have
a
later
sentence
in
this
same
thing
which,
it
says,
we
understand
that
all
this
stuff
is
at
best
persuasive,
so
if
the
intermediary
believes
any
of
the
changes
or
modifications
distort
the
reliability
of
the
data,
it
says
we'll
look
at
the
whole
thing.
that's
how
i
read
it.
in
other
words,
they're
aware
of
the
problem,
they
will
look
at
it,
and
they'll
deal
with
it
appropriately,
and
i
looked
at
that,
and
i
saw
that
you
yourselves
had
given
up
any
challenge
to
the
question--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--of
the
fairness
of
the
give-back
of
the
[dollars]
4
million.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
sorry,
i'm
mixed
up
now.
i
thought
that
the
language
i
read
you
says
to
the
hospital
during
the
re-audit,
hospital,
if
you
don't
have
old
records,
give
us
last
year's
records.
if
you
don't
have
last
year's
records,
give
us
yesterday's
records.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
had
all
the
old
records.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i...
all
right.
explain
this
particular
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
thought
if
there
is
one
piece
of
paper
missing
from
1984,
the
reg
says,
you
don't
have
that,
you've
thrown
it
away,
whatever
it
is,
give
us
your
most
recent
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
not--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
would
like
just
to
be
clear
in
my
own
mind.
what
petitioner
said
in
his
brief,
in
his
reply
brief
on
page
15,
he
says
there
was
a
re-audit,
and
then
he
says
that
they
changed
the
classification
of
certain
fixed
costs,
the
administrative
costs,
from
education
costs
to
operating
costs,
not
because
of
new
evidence
but
because
petitioner
no
longer
had
audit
documentation.
now,
i...
i
may...
i'm
not
certain
what
he
had
in
mind
by
that,
but
if
he
actually
meant
physical
pieces
of
paper,
which
does
seem
like
a
problem,
i
was
concerned
about
that.
am
i
right
in
thinking
that
isn't
the
problem,
because
if
there
are
pieces
of
paper
or
other
kinds
of
evidence
that
are
no
longer
around,
the
secretary
will
permit
the
hospital
to
introduce--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--other
evidence,
later
evidence,
or
anything
that--
