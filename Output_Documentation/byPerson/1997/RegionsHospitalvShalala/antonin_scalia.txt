justice

scalia
mr.
sutter--
--the
problem
i
have
with
this
provision
is
what
it
is
that
the
word
recognized
modifies.
you
win,
it
seems
to
me,
if
it
is
to
be
read,
that
the
average
amount
recognized
as...
recognized
as
reasonable
under
this
subchapter.
does
under
this
subchapter
go
with
recognized?
if
it
does,
i
think
your
case
is
strengthened.
but
it
could
also
be
read,
the
average
amount
recognized
as
reasonable
under
this
subchapter.
you
understand
what
i'm
saying?
if
it
has
to
have
been
recognized
under
this
subchapter,
you're...
the
text
obviously
refers
to
a
19...
to
a
prior
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
already
been
recognized.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
this
subchapter.
but
it
could
also
be
read
as
recognized
as
reasonable
under
this
subchapter,
so
that
the
prepositional
phrase,
under
this
subchapter,
goes
with
reasonable.
now,
why
is
it
that
i
should
read
it
the
first
way
rather
than
the
second?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that...
i
mean,
that's
all
very
persuasive
if
you
read
the
phrase
as
recognized
under
this
subchapter.
i
think
you
point
out
quite
correctly
to
that
provision.
that's
the
only
provision
it
could
refer
to
if
it's
talking
about
something
that
has
been
recognized
under
this
subchapter.
but
if
it's
just
talking
about
something
that
has
been
recognized
as
reasonable,
or
that
will
in
the
future
be
recognized
as
reasonable,
then
it
could
refer
to
a
new
determination
and
not
one
that
has
already
been
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
old
determination
didn't
do
it
resident
by
resident,
did
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
'84
determination
just
gave
you
the
total
figure.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
this
says
is,
you
figure
how
much
of
that
is
attributable
to
each
full-time
equivalent
resident.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sutter,
i
hope
at
some
point
you
will
tell
us...
because
this
has
to
affect
the
way
you
look
at
this
case.
there's
an
enormous
variation
between
what
the
'84
figure
would
show
and
what
the
recalculation
shows.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
gives
me,
at
least,
the
impression
that
it's
a
pretty
terrible
system
that
would
carry
forward
such
an
enormous
error,
and
if
there's
a
way
to
avoid
that,
i
would
like
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
claim
is
that
had
that
been...
had
that
method
of
calculation
been
imposed
in
1984
you
would
have
had
the
facts
and
figures
that
would
have
allocated
more
of
that
administrative
time
to
gme.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
could
have
done
that
by
re-auditing
any
ones
he
was
doubtful
about
within
the
period.
he
had
some
time
before
the
period
expired,
didn't
he,
the
3-year
re-audit
period?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
my
point
is,
they
didn't
have
to
be
forever
enshrined.
he
had
time
to
do
any
re-audits
that
were
necessary.
justice
antonin
scalia
didn't
he?
without
adopting
this
new
regulation.
he
could
have
gone
back
and
reexamined
the
1984
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
moved
quickly.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
so
we
don't
have
to
interpret
the
statute
the
way
you
suggest
in
order
to
prevent
what
would
otherwise
have
been
an
inevitable
enshrinement
of
past
mistakes.
it
wasn't
inevitable.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
word
recognized
in
there?
your
colleague
had
some
difficulty
explaining
the
phrase,
as
reasonable,
but
why
is
the
word
recognized...
why
didn't
it
just
say,
the
average
amount
reasonable
under
this
subchapter
for
direct
graduate...
why
is
the
word
recognized
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
uses
that
phrase
many
other
times,
or
at
least
several
other
times
in
the
statute
for
the
very
purpose
that
justice
souter
is
describing.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
say
that
other
language
is
more
natural
for
this
purpose
in
other
places.
it
doesn't
say...
it
says,
recognized
under
this
chapter,
this
subchapter.
it
doesn't
use,
recognized
as
reasonable,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
say
these
were
going
to
be
general
re-audits,
or
just
in...
claimed
it
was
just
in
a
few
circumstances?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
costs
seemed
questionable?
