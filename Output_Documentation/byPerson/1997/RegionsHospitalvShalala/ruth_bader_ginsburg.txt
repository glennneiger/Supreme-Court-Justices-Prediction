is
that
your
interpretation
of
it,
or
is
there
any
basis
for
saying
that
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
that
sometimes
the
hospital
might
charge
even
less
than
what
was
reasonable?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you're
giving
that
as
a
reason--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--for
why
the
word
reasonable
is
in
there.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
my
question
to
you
was,
is
that
just
your
interpretation?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
i
understand
you
right
that
you
wouldn't
be
having
any
claim
here
if
the
secretary
had
made
the
reopening
period
5
or
6
years
instead
of
3
years?
is
that
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if
you
would...
suppose
there
hadn't
been
the
3-year.
suppose
from
the
start
the
secretary
had
said,
i
want
the
reopening
period
to
be
6
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
the
same
regulation
as
the
secretary
now
has,
except
instead
of
saying
3,
it
says
6.
then
do
i
understand
that
you
wouldn't
have
any
claim?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
i
understand
that
argument,
but
i
just
wanted
to
be
clear
on
two
things.
one,
if
the
secretary
made
a
longer
period
you
wouldn't
be
contesting
that
the
amount
that
the
secretary
ultimately
arrived
at
is
an
amount
that
is
reasonable.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
up
until
the
change
that
was
made
to
take
this
as
a
base
year,
final
and
binding
meant,
we
do
it
on
a
year-by-year
basis,
so
that's...
final
and
binding
for
purposes
of
that
year,
once
a
3-year
reopening
passes
is
one
thing.
to
say
final
and
binding
forever
is
something
that
could
come
into
play
only
after
the
'86
act,
am
i
right,
because
before
then
final
and
binding
referred
only
to
the
year-by-year
determination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes,
but
that's
not
answering
my
question,
that
i...
there
was
a
change,
was
there
not,
that
up
until
then--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
you
don't
quarrel
with
any...
if
all
this
had
been
done
within
the
3
years,
you
would
have
no
quarrel
with
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
you're
saying
is,
the
secretary
got
it
wrong.
she's
got
3
years
to
get
it
right,
and
if
she
doesn't,
too
bad,
it
gets
rejected
into
the
future
until
congress
changes
it.
that's
the
essence
of
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
all
that's
another
case.
it's
not
the
one
that
we
have,
right?
for
purposes
of
this
argument
you
have
accepted,
i
thought,
that
the
second
determination
by
the
secretary
was
a
reasonable
determination.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
about
the
argument,
ms.
blatt,
that's
made
that
if
the
secretary
can
wait
this
long,
till
'90,
'91,
to
go
around
doing
what
she
should
have
done
in
the
first
place,
she
could
do
the
same
thing
in
'93?
i
believe
mr.
sutter
said
that
this
second
thought
reordering
could
go
on
forever,
so
what's
there
to
stop
her,
on
your
reading,
from
saying,
yes,
i
came
up
with
a
lower
figure
in
'90
or
'91,
but
i
could
get
it
down
even
lower
and
find
more
misallocations?
