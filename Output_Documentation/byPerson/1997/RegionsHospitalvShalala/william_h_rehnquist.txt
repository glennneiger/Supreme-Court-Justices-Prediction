chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-1375,
regions
hospital
v.
donna
shalala.
mr.
sutter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
determine
i
think
could
quite
reasonably
be
read
to
mean,
use
some
discretion,
or
judgment.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
if
they
just
meant
calculate
they
would
have
said
calculate.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
factual
development
in
the
record
is
there
to
show
that
you
were
hurt
by
this
socalled
default
rule,
that
you
didn't
have
material
that
you
had
at
one
time
but
had
disposed
of?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
my
question
was,
what
is
there
in
the
record
that
shows
you
were
injured,
that
you
could
have
produced
something
had
it
come
up
in
1988,
but
you
couldn't
when
it
came
up
in
198--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
then
you
don't
really
rely
on
the
fact
that
you
were
hurt
by
the
secretary's
decision
to
re-audit
if
it
were
justified
on
other
grounds.
in
other
words,
that
had
the...
the
secretary
perhaps
had
authority,
but
there
was
very...
it
was...
came
to
you
as
a
surprise.
you'd
thrown
your
records
away.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i...
you
can
answer
that
question
yes
or
no,
mr.
sutter.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
there
some
difference
between
a
regulation
which
perhaps
deals
with
private
actors
in
the...
in
a
private
field,
say
like
an
ftc
regulation
of
competition,
and
a
regulation
issued
by
the
secretary
which
basically
just
determines
how
government
money
is
going
to
be
spent?
i
mean,
don't
we
give
more
latitude
to
the
latter,
usually?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
where
does
the
presumption
in
favor
of
issue
preclusion
come
from?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
this
is
not
a
redetermination
for
the
same
purpose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
sutter.
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
was
the
date
of
this
federal
register?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
ms.
blatt,
i
have
one
more
question.
do
you
have
any
response
to
the
point,
which
seems
to
me
a
fairly
substantial
one,
made
by
the
petitioner
that
in
the
same
legislation
that
enacted
this
provision
congress
instructed
the
secretary
to
report
back
by
december
31,
1987
on
whether
there
should
be
any
revisions
to
provide
greater
uniformity
in
the
approved
fte
resident
amounts?
now,
how
could
she
possibly
have
done
that
by
december
31,
1987,
unless
everything...
unless
she
had
made
these
determinations
by
1987?
i
mean,
isn't
that
a
pretty
clear
indication
that
congress
expected
this
stuff
to
be
done
by
'87?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
the
case
is
submitted.
