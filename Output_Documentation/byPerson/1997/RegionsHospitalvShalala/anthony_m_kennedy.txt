justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
just
following
up
on
justice
ginsburg's
question,
you
would
agree
the
agency
could
have
repealed
the
3-year
window
for
examining
the
costs
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so
by
regulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
statute
froze
into
place
the
congressional...
pardon
me,
the
administrative
regulations
on
re-audit?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
a
large
part
of
your
brief,
and
i
thought
it
was
a
convincing
argument
when
i
first
examined
it,
was
that
hospitals
have
thrown
away
their
records
for
1984
and
they're
prejudiced,
but
that
seems
to
be
falling--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
have
a
page
citation
for
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
the
petitioner's
brief?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
see.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
this
case,
or
in
the
run-of-the-mind
case,
does
the
misallocation
indicate
that
the
government
actually
paid
too
much
even
under
the
old
program,
or
would
the
government
come
out
just
the
same
either
way,
and
it
just
affects
the
gme
program
because
of
misallocation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i'm
glad
you
understood
it,
because
it's
hard
to
put--
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
hard...
in
other
words,
was
the
government
prejudiced
for
reasons
other
than
the
gme
program,
or
was
it
just
under
the
gme
program
that
it
is
paying
too
much
or
paying
too
little,
depending
on
who
wins
here?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
even
without
reference
to
the
gme
program?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
the
government
paid
too
much
even
under
the
1984
scheme?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
