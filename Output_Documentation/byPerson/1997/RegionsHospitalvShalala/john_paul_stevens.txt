justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
one
of
the
phrases
that
troubles
me?
it's
a
hard
statute
to
follow,
but
you
quoted
to
us
from
sections
oo
and
so
forth.
they
were
in
the
statute
before
1986,
i
believe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
therefore
the
duty
to
make
a
determination
existed
before
the
1986
amendment.
now,
therefore,
the
word
in
the
1986
amendment
that
seems
interesting
to
me
is
the
secretary
shall
determine.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
1986
it
imposed
a
new
duty
to
make
a
determination
that
did
not
previously
exist.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
sounds
to
me
as
though
they
may
have
said
you're
not
necessarily
bound
by
what
you
would
have
done
under
the
preexisting
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just
interrupt
on
that
first
point?
you
said,
does
not
say
the
amount
already
recognized,
but
the
reason
for
that
it
seems
to
me
might
be
that
there's
a...
the
3-year
period
hadn't
run
yet,
so
some
of
the...
some
of
them
had
to
be
in
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
a
good
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
congress
thought
there
might
be
one
amount
that
would
be
determined
in
the
3-year
period
for
the
1984
reimbursement
and
still
a
different
amount
based
on
1984
for
this
permanent
program?
is
it
reasonable
to
think
congress
thought
there
would
be
two
1984
determinations,
both
of
which
would
be
reasonable?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
not
questioning
the
reasonableness
of
her
judgment
and
all
that.
i'm
just
trying
to
sit...
if
i'm
sitting
in
congress
in
1986,
what
did
i
expect
to
happen
under
this
language?
did
i
expect
her
to
make
two
different
determinations
of
reasonableness
for
1984
for
this
particular
hospital.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you're
suggesting
there's
something
magical
about
a
one-time
adjustment.
the
other
side
might
argue,
well,
the
first
determination
they
paid
on
was
a
one-time,
thought-to-be-final
adjustment.
if
you
can
have
a
second
one-time
adjustment,
why
not
a
third
and
a
fourth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
amendment
was
in
'86,
and
there
was
still...
the
final
determination
of
reasonableness
just
on
how
much
you're
going
to
pay
this
hospital
was
still
subject
to
change.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well
then,
i'm
just
not
sure
why
that
argument
wouldn't
allow
her
in
1999
to
say,
well,
i
can't
recover
anything
earlier
than
1995,
say,
but
i
can
still
change
the
basic
rules
for
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
there's
a
good
reason
why.
she
didn't
realize
there
were
a
lot
of
misallocations.
she
made
a
lot
of
mistakes
before,
which
is
the
same
reason
she
has
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
imperfect
knowledge.
