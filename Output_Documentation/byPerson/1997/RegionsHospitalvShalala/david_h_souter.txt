justice
david
h.
souter
well,
there's
no
reason
it
would
want
two
amounts,
but
there
is
a
reason
that
it
might
want
a
corrected
amount,
and
suddenly
a
figure
which
in
the
past
has
been
used
solely
to
calculate
a
reimbursement
for
1
year
is
going
to
be
the
basis
for
reimbursement
in
effect
in
perpetuity
until
the
law
gets
changed,
so
i
mean,
there's
a...
there
would
be
a
good
reason
on
congress'
part
to
want
to
make
sure
that
the
ultimate
figure
was
the
right
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
we're
not
talking...
i
mean,
it's
not
as
though...
but
i
guess
my
only
point
is,
i
don't
see
that
you
get
anywhere
by
saying
congress
wouldn't
have
wanted
two
figures.
congress
wants
one
figure
and
it
wants
the
right
figure.
justice
david
h.
souter
let
me
ask
you
this.
going
back
to
justice
scalia's
question,
on
your
reading,
what
is
served
by
having
the
modifier,
as
reasonable,
in
there
at
all,
because
on
your
reading
once
the
figure
has
been
recognized,
that's
it
for
all
purposes,
including
future
calculation.
justice
david
h.
souter
but...
may
i
interrupt
you
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
any
given...
in
the
case
of
any
given
hospital
for
the
base
year
there
has
been,
at
least
in
the
past
with
respect
to
that
year,
that
annual
reimbursement,
only
one
figure
recognized,
isn't
that
so?
in
other
words,
the
secretary
didn't
say,
well,
we'll
reimburse
you
either
the
a
amount
or
the
b
amount,
depending
on
methodology.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it's
interesting
that
the
term
which
we're
considering
is
not
the
amount
recognized
as
reasonable
for
each
full-time...
each
fte.
it's
the
average
amount
recognized
as
reasonable,
and
the
so-called
average
amount
has
never
been
recognized.
that
is
a
purely
prospective
determination,
isn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
shall
determine
the
average
amount,
and
that
so-called
average
amount
has
never
been
determined
in
the
past.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
except
that
it
didn't
have
the
modifier
average
on
there.
it
was
talking
about
a
different
figure.
it
was
talking...
as
you
have
pointed
out
earlier,
it
was
talking
about
the
numerator.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
they
may
not
have
it,
but
weren't
they
put
on
notice
by
the
secretary
that
there
would
indeed
be
this
recalculation,
so
can
any
hospital
at
this
point
claim
that
they
were
surprised
to
find
that
they
would
like
to
look
at
old
records
which
they
tossed
out?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
didn't
suggest
otherwise.
i
mean,
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
--how
did
it
suggest
otherwise?
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
blatt,
would
you
help
me
out
on
one
thing?
i
thought
i
understood
how
the
3-year
period
works,
and
now
i'm
not
so
sure
i
do.
i
thought
that
at
the
end
of
the...
whatever
the
fiscal
year
is
involved
here,
the
hospital
in
effect
would
submit
the
equivalent
of
a
bill
with
whatever
supporting
documents
it
has
to
submit,
and
the
bill
would
either
get
paid
or
they
would
fight
it
out
then
and
there,
but
that
even
after
the
bill
was
paid
there
was
a
3-year
period
during
which
the
secretary
might
reopen
and
do
a
re-audit.
is
that
basically
how
it
does
work?
or,
conversely,
is
the
3-year
period
simply
the
period
within
which,
to
put
it
as
i
was
doing
it,
the
bill
has
to
be
paid?
which
is
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
the
reason
i...
the
reason
the
question
interests
me
goes
back
to
justice
stevens'
question.
if
that's
the
way
it
works,
at
the
time
this
statute
was
passed,
would
it
not
normally
have
been
the
case
that
all
hospitals
would
at
least
have
been
paid
in
the
first
instance
and,
as
an
implication
of
that,
their
back-up,
their
figures,
their
costs
would
have
been
recognized
in
the
first
instance
as
reasonable,
but
they
would,
nonetheless,
have
been
subject
to
a
re-audit
within
3
years.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
was
saying--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
reimbursement
implies
a
recognition.
is
that
a
misuse
of
the
term?
justice
david
h.
souter
--i
was
going
to
say,
i
suppose
for
the
purposes
of
your
case
it
doesn't
matter
whether
my
reading
is
the
better
one
or
your
reading
is
the
better
one.
there's
at
least
some
kind
of
a
reasonable
disagreement,
and
in
that
circumstance
the
secretary
supposedly
can
cast
the
determinative
vote
by
the
way
she
interprets
it.
