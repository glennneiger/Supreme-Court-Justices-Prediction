mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
your
honor.
why
don't
i
begin
with
that.
california
involved
a
claim
that
the...
the
question
was
whether
there
was
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
in
the
united
states
against
the
state
of
california
where
california
had
not
violated
federal
law
and
it
had
not
invaded
any
sovereign
right
of
the
united
states.
the
only
reason
the
united
states
was
in
the
case
was
it
had
voluntarily
agreed
to
indemnify
a
third
party
that
had
paid
the
tax
potentially
in
violation
of
state
law.
this
court
held
that
the
united
states
could
not
use
its
voluntary
indemnification
of
that
third
party
to
create
a
federal
common
law
cause
of
action
out
of
what
was
in
essence
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
in
essence,
the
federal
government
did
not
obtain
any
greater
rights
than
the
third
party
that
had
indemnified
had
to
begin
with.
here,
in
contrast,
there
is
a
federal
cause
of
action.
montana
violated
not
state
law,
but
it
violated
federal
law,
and
it
did
not
violate
the
law...
the
rights
of
a
third
party.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
certainly,
and--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--cause
of
action
can
be...
the
phrase,
cause
of
action,
can
be
used
two
ways.
one
is
in
the
sense
of
a
valid
stated
claim
on
which
relief
can
be
granted.
the
other
one
is
the
question
of
whether
the
litigant
is
within
the
category
of
potential
plaintiffs
who
are
entitled
to
bring
that
sort
of
claim.
regardless
of
which
sense
it
is,
it
was...
you
use
the
word,
it
was
clear
in
the
united
states
v.
california
case
that
the
united
states
could
not
bring
that
cause
of
action,
and
here
it's
clear
that
we
are.
the
united
states
in
this
case
did
not
only
bring
a
case,
it
prevailed.
it
obtained
permanent
relief
based
on
its
claim,
so
here
there
is
a
cause
of
action.
in
california
the
substantive
holding
was
there
was
no
cause
of
action.
accordingly,
the
claim
by
the
united
states
should
have
been
dismissed,
and
it
should
not
have
been
in
federal
court
to
begin
with.
it
simply
was
not
a
proper
party
to
bring
that
case.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
case
could
be
brought,
and
i
think
this
is
in
part
a
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
and
that
is
that
the
purpose
of
a
remedy
such
as
restitution
is
to
restore
the
parties
to
the
position
they
would
have
occupied
had
federal
law
been
respected
to
begin
with.
restitution
begins
that
process
by
forcing
the
defendant
to
disgorge
its
unlawful
gains.
now,
it's
important
in
tax
cases
to
start
with
a
disclosure
and
then
let
defendant--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--well,
the
next
step,
however,
in
the
analysis,
your
honor,
is,
where
there's
a
gross
disparity
between
the
two...
between
the
injury
to
the
plaintiff
and
the
unjust
gain
to
the
defendant,
the
court
can
deny
restitution
because
the
restitution
would
not...
the
enrichment
was
not
unjust
visavis
the
plaintiff.
another
way
of
looking
at
it
is
simply,
if
the
plaintiff
has
no
injury
whatsoever
it
cannot
seek
restitution.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
our
response
to
that
is
the
same
response
that
the
court
below
had,
which
is,
it's
not
supported
by
the
evidence,
and
there's
two
reasons
why--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--first,
the
evidence
supports
that
in
the
absence
of
the
montana
tax,
westmoreland
is
willing
to
pay
additional
royalties
to
the
tribe
whether
by
way
of
tax
or
by
way
of
royalty
agreements
in
any
amount
that
it
saved
from
the
montana
tax.
in
other
words,
any
reduction
in
the
montana
tax
would
have
been...
westmoreland
was
willing
to
pay
that
to
the
tribe.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
there's
a
letter
from
westmoreland
to
the
tribe
in
joint
appendix
page
87,
and
during
that
it
says
that
we
have
previously
negotiated
regarding
additional
royalties.
however,
any
additional
payments
to
you
will
have
to
be
in
lieu
of
the
state
tax
and
not
in
addition
to.
and
in
addition,
at
joint
appendix
pages
397
and
400
there
are
statements
by
westmoreland
to
the
effect
that
they
were
willing...
any
reduction
in
montana
tax
that
the
tribe
could
obtain
through
its
use
of
its
governmental
or
sovereign
authority--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--in
light
of
the
negotiations
that
had
occurred,
that
is
what
it
means,
and
on
page
397
and
400
of
the
joint
appendix,
again
there
is
testimony
that
they're
willing
to
share
any
savings
that
the
tribe
could
obtain
from
the
montana
tax
for
them
through
use
of
its
governmental
authorities
with
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
your
honor,
it's
not...
i
don't
think
there
is
a
precise
one...
necessarily
a
proven
precise
onetoone
correspondence
between
the
loss
to
this
tribe
in
this
case
and
the
amount
of
restitution
awarded
by
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
well,
i
think
your
honor,
equity
starts...
restitution
starts
with
the
unlawful
gain
to
the
defendant,
and
the
reason
it
starts
there...
and
i'll
go
to
how
it
can
get
reduced.
the
reason
it
starts
there
is
an
important
protection
for
the
state.
if
it
were
simply
a
damages
action
the
state's
liability
would
not
be
limited
to
the
amount
of
its
unjust
gain.
it
would--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--if
westmoreland
had
recovered
the
money,
under
the
doctrines
of
benefits
conferred
the
claim
would
no
longer
be
against
montana
but
upon...
the
beneficiary
of
the
tax
would
be
westmoreland,
so
the
tribe's
action
would
have
to
run
against
westmoreland
and
not
the
state
of
montana.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
answer
is
potentially
yes,
and
this
is--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--yes,
your
honor,
and
that
would
depend
on
the
validity
of
the
1976
tax.
the
1976
tax,
although
initially
the
secretary
declined
to
approve
it,
the
secretary
did
approve
the
tax--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--excuse
me.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
that's
correct,
and
when
there
is...
and
if
westmoreland
objected
on
that
basis
a
trial
court
would
be
justified
in
rolling
back
the
restitutionary
remedy
and
saying,
well,
the
goal
here
is
to
return
the
parties
to
the
position
they
would
have
occupied
if
federal
law
had
been
obeyed.
i
think
the--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
true.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
if
montana
had
raised
and
proven
through
evidence
that
the
damages
were
grossly
disproportionate,
got
much
lower
than
the
restitution
or
remedy,
a
court
would
be
justified
in
rolling
back
the
restitution
or
remedy.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
i
think,
your
honor,
the
starting
point
is
always
the
gain
to
the
defendant.
at
that
point,
it's
the
defendant's
obligation
to
come
forward
and
say,
assert
and
prove
that
this
inherent
restitutionary
remedy,
based
on
its
gain,
is
inequitable--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--because
it
overcompensates
the
plaintiff.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
yes,
your
honor.
the
position
is
that
if
it's
not
grossly
disproportional,
a
little
bit
of
difference
between
the
restitutionary
measure
and
the
damages
measure
does
not
make
a
difference.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
in
the
abstract--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
cases
run
exactly
that
way.
even
where
the
money
is
not
obtained
directly
from
the
plaintiff,
it
is
the
defendant's
obligation
to
come
forward
and
show
that
restitution
would
be
unjust
or--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--the
first
error
the
district
court
committed,
your
honor,
is
the
district
court
failed
to
consider
additional
royalties
as
a
possible
source
of
gain
to
the
tribe.
the
district
court
looked
simply
at
the
possibility
of
a
tax,
and
even
there
the
district
court
had
conflicting
holdings.
on
the
one
hand
it
held
that
the
tax
had
not
been
approved
by
the
secretary,
so
westmoreland
wouldn't
have
paid
it.
on
the
other
hand,
it
held
that
the
tax
had
been
approved
by
the
secretary
because
the
ceded
strip
is
part
of
the
reservation
and
the
tax
was
approved
as
to
the...
excuse
me,
the
coal
under
the
ceded
strip
was
part
of
the
reservation
and
the
tax
had
been
approved
as
to
the
reservation.
accordingly,
under
that
holding,
if
westmoreland
had
not
paid
the
money
to
the
state
of
montana
instead,
the
tribe
would
be
proceeding
against
westmoreland
for
the
money.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
the
district
court's
holding
came
from
1990,
that's
correct,
but
the
court
of
appeals
had
the
same
holding
back
in
1982
in
crow
i.--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i'm
not
sure
why
it
would
make
any
difference,
because
the
point
of
the
matter
is,
if
the
tax
was
valid
the
crow
tribe
could
go
after
westmoreland
for
the
tax.
it's
not
doing
so
here
because
westmoreland
was
not
the
party--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--actually,
the
court...
the
district
court
didn't
say
you
should
have
given
permission.
it
said
that
you
in
fact
did.
you
may
not
have
intended
to,
but
the
moment
you
said
the
tax
is
approved
as
to
the
reservation,
a
fortiori
it
applied
to
the
coal
in
the
ceded
strip,
because
that
is
part
of
the
reservation,
so
when
the
secretary
wrote
down
the
words,
approved--
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
--there
is
no
district
court
holding
on
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
a.
lamken
it
did,
your
honor.
the
suit
was
filed
in
1978.
the
only
reason
they
didn't
get
an
injunction
until
1982
was
the
claim
was
dismissed
for
failure
to
state
a
claim.
until
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
that
dismissal
there's
no
chance
whatsoever
of
our...
of
obtaining
an
injunction
against
the
tax.
