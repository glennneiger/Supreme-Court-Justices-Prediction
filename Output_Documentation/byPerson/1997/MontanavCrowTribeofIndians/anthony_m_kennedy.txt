justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
complaint
was
amended,
as
i
recall,
after
our
affirmance
in
crow
ii?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
money
had
and
received
the
same
as
restitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
another
way
of
saying
that
would
be
that
there
was
no
duty
to
pay
the
tribe.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
the
restitution
cases
there's
usually
a
duty
to
pay
the
person
that
seeks
to
recover
later
on.
mr.
smith,
judging
from
the
number
of
times
you
cite
it
in
your
brief
i
gather
you
rely
rather
heavily
on
our
decision
in
united
states
v.
california.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well--
--if
the
tribe
had
executed
its
leases
and
the...
and
with
the
royalty
agreements,
and
after
the
execution
of
those
mining
agreements
or
leases
had
then
imposed
a
tax,
would
that
have
been
inconsistent
with
the
contract
documents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
the
tribe
could
have
imposed
its
tax
if
it
had
chosen
to
do
so
after
executing
the
agreements.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
was
that
a
matter
of
the
tribe's
sovereign
authority,
or
was
part
of
that
decision
motive,
it
was
one
of
the
reasons
offered
in
denial
of
the
permission
to
tax,
the
fact
that
the
tribe
had
already
made
a
contract?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
quite
apart
from
the
tribe's
sovereign
authority,
westmoreland
might
have
had
an
argument
that
this...
that
the
imposition
of
the
tax
was
inconsistent
with
its
contract
negotiations.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
i
understand
your
theory,
if
california
taxed
a
corporation
that
was
doing
business
in
california
and
nevada
and
the
corporation
said,
you
know,
really,
this
is
interstate
commerce,
you
can't
tax
our
income,
and
settled
with
california,
under
your
theory
i
guess
nevada
could
say,
we
don't
have
a
corporate
income
tax,
but
you
know,
you
took
the
tax
that
really
should
have
been
ours,
so
we'll
sue
you,
state
of
california.
i
suppose
under
your
theory
nevada
would
prevail.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
under
that,
nevada
says,
you
know,
this
money
must
belong
to
somebody.
the
company's
settled.
california,
it's
not
yours.
it
should
be
ours.
