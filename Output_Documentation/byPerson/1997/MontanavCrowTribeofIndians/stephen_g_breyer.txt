why
can't
they
just
get
restitution?
why
couldn't...
i
mean,
here
why
can't
the...
here's...
i
take
it
there's
a
person
who
paid
some
taxes
to
the
state
and
the
indian
tribe
says,
well,
the
state
doesn't...
isn't
entitled
to
that
money,
and
we're
more
entitled
to
it
than
they
are,
because
probably
we
would
have
gotten
at
least
some
of
it,
so
we
would
like
it
in
restitution.
why
shouldn't
they
have
it?
the
state
isn't
entitled
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
add
that
my
law
clerk
found
a
bunch
of
cases
that
do
seem,
in
restitution,
to
give
one
of
the
two
competing
entities
in
taxes...
you
pay
it
to
the
wrong
one,
well,
the
right
one
has
a
right
in
restitution
to
get
it
from
the
wrong
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
when
you
say
common
law
authority,
what
common
law
authority?
that
is,
i
found...
i
thought
restitution
authority
is
you're
supposed
to
do
basically
what's
just,
and
if
person
a
takes
the
property
of
person
b
and
puts
it
to
a
use
whereby
he
makes
some
money
out
of
it,
that
money...
you
know,
person
a
wrongfully
takes
the
property
of
b
and
makes
some
money
out
of
its
use,
and
that
money
finds
its
way
into
the
hands
of
c,
i
would
have
thought
restitution
would
give
it
back
to
the
original
owner
of
the
property.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i
didn't
think
there
was
some
general,
technical
thing.
i
thought
you're
supposed
to
do
basically
what's
fair.
here
they
had
some
property,
and
it
was
put
to
some
use,
and
it
ended
up
generating
some
money,
and
the
money
ends
up
in
the
hands
of
a
person
who
has
no
right
to
it
whatsoever,
but
they
might
have
gotten
it
out
of
the
property.
why
shouldn't
restitution
or
equity
come
back
and
put
it
where
it
belongs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
they
got
58
million
which
was
tax,
which
tax
was
generated
through
the
use
of
some
coal
that
started
out
belonging
to
the
tribe,
and
that
coal
generated
some
money
that
was
used
to
pay
a
tax
that
went
into
the
hands
of
a
person
who
has
no
right
to
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
is
there
some
common
law
authority
that
says
you
couldn't
do
that,
bring
it
back?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
show...
are
you
going
to
be
able
to
show
that
if
the
montana
tax...
everybody
had
known
from
the
very
beginning
that
they
couldn't
have
done
it,
everybody
would
have
known
that
you...
that
the
tribe
could
have
gotten
more
royalties
from
westmoreland?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
the
same
pile
of
money.
i
mean,
it's
a
pile
of
money
that's
traceable--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
know
from
west...
we're
talking
about
the
damages,
and
what
i'm
interested
in
is
whether
you
think
you'd
be
able
to
show
that
in
the
absence
of
this
unlawful
tax,
everybody
knew
it
was
unlawful.
everybody
knew
from
the
year
1800
that
they
couldn't
do
it.
now,
if
they
had
known
that
all
in
advance,
would
the
tribe
have
been
able,
even
if
the
secretary
of
the
interior
made
the
mistake
about
the
tax,
they
say,
okay,
you're
right,
we
can't
tax
you,
westmoreland,
but
what
we
can
do
is
increase
our
royalties,
and
we
will.
now,
do
you
think
that
you
can
show
that
that's
what
would
have
happened?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
at
that
time...
that's
what
i
wonder,
you
see.
at
that
time
when
they
set
the
royalty,
what
was
in
the
air?
what
did--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean,
i
can
understand
my...
to
reveal
what
i'm
thinking,
i'm
thinking
that
if
this
money
can
be
traceable
really
to
the
sale
of
the
coal,
which
is
the
tribe's,
it
is
rather
like
somebody
unlawfully
taking
my
car
and
use
it
to
sell
pizzas,
and
earns
money
for
it,
and
i
should
get
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
you
can't
show
that,
it
might
be
different.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
their
point
is
that,
that
i
take
it
that
the,
montana's
point
is
that
in
the
absence
of
this
unlawful
tax
of
the
58
million,
or
whatever,
the
tribe
couldn't
have
gotten
the
money.
it
couldn't
have
gotten
the
money
through
a
royalty
because
it
had
long
previously
signed
a
definite
contract.
it
couldn't
have
gotten
the
money
through
a
tax
because
the
secretary
of
the
interior
had
said
you
can't
tax.
so
in
the
absence
of
their
having
taken
the
money,
the
tribe
could
never
have
seen
a
penny
of
it,
regardless,
and
therefore
they
are
not
a
proper
person
to
give
the
money
back
to.
now,
i
take
it
that
that's
basically
their
point,
as
i've
understood
it,
and
so
what
is
your
response
directly
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
what
does...
and
fine,
so
what
is...
what
does
the
evidence
support,
in
your
view?
