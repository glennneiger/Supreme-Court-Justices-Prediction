we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1829,
montana
v
the
crow
tribe
of
indians.
mr.
smith.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
do
you
fit
that
into
your
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
smith,
was
westmoreland
a
plaintiff
in
some
of
these
actions?
i
mean,
did
it
sue
the
state
of
montana?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
by--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
how
did
that
claim
finally
come
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
settlement
between
the
state
and
westmoreland?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
mr.
pelcyger,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
footnote
is
it
in
your
brief,
mr.
pelcyger?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
pelcyger.
mr.
lamken,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lamken,
sometime
in
the
course
of
your
argument
i'd
appreciate
your
saying
why
this
case
isn't
controlled
by
california
v.
united
states.
it's
been
suggested
that
california
did
not
involve
a
federal
cause
of
action,
and
here
it
does,
a
violation
of
a
federal
right,
but
as
i
read
the
california
opinion,
the
court's
reasoning
didn't
turn
on
that
fact.
if
you'll
just
address
that
sometime
in
your
argument.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
a
federal
cause
of
action.
the
united
states
v.
california
came
up
through
the
federal
courts,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
must
have
been...
the
united
states
must
have
had
a
right
to
go
into
court
to
make
the
assertion
that
it
should
recover.
i
wonder
if
your
denominated
cause
of
action
is
right,
or
whether
you
don't
mean
that
your
argument
is
there
was
a
violation
of
a
federal
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lamken.
the
case
is
submitted.
