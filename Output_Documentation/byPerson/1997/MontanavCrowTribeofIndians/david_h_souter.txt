justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
about
a
possibly
different
way
of
looking
at
the
case
or
characterizing
the
claim?
up
to
this
point
we've
been
doing
it
in
terms
of
basically
a
competition
between
two
taxing
sovereigns.
one
taxed
when
it
shouldn't.
the
other
one
could
have
and
in
effect
wants
the
money
that
the
first
one
wrongfully
took.
but
there's
another
way,
i
think,
to
look
at
this,
and
that
is
to
emphasize
what
i
take
is
not
subject
to
dispute
either
as
a
matter
of
the
record
or
as
a
matter
of
economics,
and
that
was
that
what
the
state
of
montana
took
through
its
taxation
was
a
very
substantial
percentage
of
the
economic
value
of
the
coal.
they
were...
the
tribe
was
able
to
keep,
or
westmoreland
was
able
to
keep
on
selling
it
with
the
tax
added,
but
in
fact
the
ultimate
party
losing
was
the
party
that
owned
the
coal.
so
that
if
we
look
at
it
that
way,
what
we
have
here
is
a
contest
between
a
government
which,
through
its
taxation,
took
a
substantial
interest
in
the
property
of
the
tribe.
now
the
tribe,
whether
you
call
it
a
taxing
authority
or
simply
the
owner
of
the
coal,
wants
that
wrongfully
taken
portion
of
its
economic
value
back.
the
state
of
montana
does
not
have
a
legal
leg
to
stand
on
as
the
taxing
authority.
that's
behind
us.
we
know
that
the
tax
was
in
fact
an
invalid
tax,
so
as
between
the
state
of
montana,
which
took
this
substantial
economic
value,
and
the
owner
of
the
property,
the
owner
of
the
value
which
was
taken,
why
isn't
it
fairly
clear
that
the
owner
of
the
value
taken,
the
tribe,
ought
to
get
it
back?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it
wouldn't
have
because
westmoreland
couldn't
have
passed
it
on,
either
as
a
matter
of
the
utilities
law
or
as
a
matter
of
economics.
what,
as
i
understand
it,
westmoreland
was
doing
with
respect
to
the
montana
tax
was
simply
passing
it
on
to
its
customers.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
so
westmoreland
was
getting
the
same
profit
on
its
contract
that
it
would
have
been
getting
if
it
had,
in
fact,
not
been
subject
to
montana
tax.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
fact
that
the
coal
was
still
saleable
at
westmoreland's
price,
plus
the
35
percent,
is
an
indication
of
the
value
that
was
in
the
coal
and
ultimately
that
value
belonged
to
the
owner
of
the
coal
who
was
selling
it,
and
that
was
the
tribe,
wasn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
they
didn't
make
a
good
lease
agreement.
i
have
no
idea.
but
the
fact
is,
even
if
they
didn't
make
a
good
lease
agreement,
it
doesn't
follow
that
the
state
of
montana
is
entitled
to
take
what
they
should
have
been
getting
for
themselves.
as
between
the
state
of
montana
and
the
tribe,
i
don't
see
why
the
tribe's
claim
is
not
the
obviously
prevailing
one,
if
that's
a
proper
way
of
looking
at
the
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we're
in
the
position
of
fashioning
a
remedy
for
what
was,
in
fact,
a
violation
of
federal
law,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
you
that
we
are
necessarily
bound
by
categories
of
common
law
remedial
practice
in
fashioning
that
remedy.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
smith,
in
your
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
a
moment
ago,
your
reliance
on
california
and,
i
gather,
in
your
answer
to
me,
you're
assuming
that
one...
i
think
one
of
the
things
you're
assuming
is
that
in
the
question
of,
as
it
were,
the
value
of
the
property
to
the
tribe
and
what
the
tribe
may
properly
claim
as
value
taken
from
it,
the
tribe's
contract
with
westmoreland
is
in
fact
a
limitation
on
what
the
tribe
can
claim.
why
should
that
be
a
limitation
as
between
the
tribe
and
montana?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr....
i'm
sorry.
mr.
pelcyger,
i
want
to
ask
whether
the
terms
of
the
lease
might
have
a
bearing
on
the
answer
to
justice
o'connor's
question.
assume
the
following.
assume
that
at
a
given
time
the
secretary
of
the
interior
said,
you
may
not
tax.
assume
that
westmoreland
says,
as
it
did,
i
don't
care
who
i
pay
the
money
to.
i
can
sell
the
coal
at
this
price,
and
you
guys
fight
it
out.
if
the
tax
at
that
point
had
been
declared
invalid,
as
it
was,
could
the
tribe...
did
the
tribe
have
a
right
under
its
lease
agreement
simply
to
demand
a
renegotiation
of
the
price
at
which
it
would
sell
so
that
it
could
have
gotten
as
its
lease
price
what
the
department
of
the
interior
was
not
allowing
it
to
get
by
way
of
taxation?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
same
would
be
true
for
montana,
then,
too,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't
it
clear
on
the
record
that
if
the
criterion
of
what
the
tribe
gets
looks
to
the
position
that
the
tribe
would
have
been
in
but
for
the
tax,
even
on
that
criterion,
the
tribe,
based
on
the
record
we've
got,
would
not
have
gotten
all
that
montana
took.
justice
david
h.
souter
--excuse
me.
are
you
making
this
turn
basically
on
procedure,
that
although
there
is
indication
in
the
record
that
the
tribe
in
fact
would
not
have
received,
either
by
lease
negotiation
or
by
taxation,
what
dollarfordollar
montana
took,
that
somehow
montana
nonetheless
has
got
to
give
it
all
back
because
montana
did
not
go
through
some
procedure
of
proving
that,
even
though
we've
got
evidence
in
the
record
that
indicates
that?
is
that
your
position?
