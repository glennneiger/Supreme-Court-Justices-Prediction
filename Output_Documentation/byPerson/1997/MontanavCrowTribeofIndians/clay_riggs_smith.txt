mr.
clay
riggs
smith
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
issue
today
is
whether
a
federal
court
may
award
to
respondents,
crow
tribe
and
the
united
states,
58
million
paid
to
the
petitioners
by
a
third
party,
westmoreland
resources.
reduced
to
its
essentials,
the
respondents'
theory
is
that
a
federal
court
has
this
discretion
and
in
reality
the
obligation
to
make
such
an
award
merely
because
the
taxes
have
been
held
preempted
and
the
actual
taxpayer
has
no
entitlement
to
their
recovery.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
justice
o'connor,
we
believe
the
action
in
this
matter
is
limited
to
a
cause
of
action
for
money
had
and
received,
a
cause--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--your
honor,
that
is--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--your
honor,
that
is
correct
in
the
crow
ii
decision,
the
1987
ninth
circuit
decision.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
court
of--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--yes,
your
honor,
we
are,
but
i
would
add,
by
way
of
further
elaboration,
that
in
determining
the
appropriate
remedy
i
think
the
court
is
confronted
with
the
question
of
whether
a
federal
cause
of
action
or
a
federal
common
law
claim
should
be
recognized
under
these
circumstances
for--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--your
honor,
that
is
not
precisely
the
argument
we
make.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
argument
we
make,
if
i
may
go
on,
is
that
in
this
case
we
essentially
dealt...
played
the
hand
we
were
dealt
in
terms
of
the
respondent's
theory
and
their
theory
of
recovery,
as
set
forth
in
their
amended
complaints
and,
indeed,
in
subsequent
pleadings
and
in
the
pretrial
order,
was
a
theory
which
sought
recovery
of
taxes
paid
by
westmoreland
resources.
had...
had
the
respondents
attempted
to
recover
compensatory
damages,
that
is
to
say,
damages
directed
specifically
to
the
injury
that
the
tribe
suffered
with
respect
to
the
marketability
of
its
coal,
we
would
have
an
entirely
different
case
than
we
have
before
us
today.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
it
was
amended
in
1989
by
the
tribe,
it's
fourth
amended
complaint,
and
the
united
states
filed
essentially
the
same
complaint
6
months
later
in
1990.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
i
would
say
not.
restitution
is
a
broader
concept
which
covers
a
rather
extensive
range
of
potential
remedies.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--justice
breyer,
the
claim
that
is
sought,
again,
or
is
alleged,
deals
with
restitution
of
a
specific
kind
of
payment,
in
this
case
taxes
paid
to
the
respondents
by
westmoreland.
it
seeks,
in
essence,
a
traditional
quasicontract
remedy,
and
it
has
been
the
petitioners'
position
throughout
that,
given
the
nature
of
the
quite
specific
remedy
sought,
that
the
traditional
standards
associated
with
quasicontract
govern
the
respondents'
entitlement
to
those
moneys.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor
and,
indeed,
the
district
court
so
found
following
the
1994
trial,
the
second
trial
in
this
matter.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
vast
bulk
of
the
taxes
at
issue
were
paid
during
the
period
betweenl
1975
and
1982.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
no
duty
on
the
part
of
westmoreland
to
pay
the
tribe.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
we
believe
that
california
stands
for
the
general
proposition
that
quasicontract
relief
is
available
as
a
matter
of
federal
common
law
only
with
respect
to
the
entity
or
person
who
bears
the
legal
incidence
of
the
tax.
moreover,
the
facts
in
california
are
remarkably
similar
to
the
facts
here,
in
the
sense
that
the
united
states
in
that
case,
similar
to
the
tribe
in
this
case,
was
attempting
to
enforce
in
essence
an
independent
obligation
that
may
have
existed
between
the
federal
contractor
in
that
case
and
the
united
states,
just
as
the
tribe
in
this
case
is,
when
you
cut
through
the
chaff,
is
attempting
to
enforce
real
or
imagined
obligations
that
the...
that
westmoreland
may
have
had
to
the
tribe
under
the
terms
of
the
1976
tribal
tax
code.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
justice
o'connor--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--justice
o'connor,
as
i
said
before
if
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
had
pursued
an
actual
or
compensatory
damages
case,
this
matter
would
be
quite
different.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
the
respondents
in
this
case
made
a
very
conscious
decision
not
to
pursue
a
damages
claim
with
respect
to
westmoreland.
indeed,
they
did
pursue
a
damages
claim
with
respect
to
shell,
the
shell
transaction.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
i
may
have
misspoke.
the
tribe
attempted
to
amend
its
complaint
in
1993
to
allege,
in
essence,
a
damages
claim
against
the
state
and
the
county
with
respect
to
the
nondevelopment
of
a
project
on
the
reservation
called
young's
creek,
and
we
loosely
call
that
the
shell
issue,
and
that
issue
was
resolved
against
it
by
the
district
court
and
by
the
court
of
appeals.
with
respect
to
westmoreland,
the
tribe
has
consistently
declined
to
pursue
a
damages
claim.
indeed,
the--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
the...
when
i
say
westmoreland,
i'm
speaking
of
the
production
under
the
lease
agreement
between
westmoreland
and
the
tribe,
but
as...
and
it's
summarized
perhaps
in
most
detail
in
our
opposition,
which
is
clerk's
record
600,
to
the
united
states
and
the
tribe's
motion
to
amend
their
amended
complaints
in
1993.
we
summarized
in
some
detail
the
conscious
decision
by
the
respondents
not
to
pursue
a
damages
claim,
and
that
description
appears
on
pages
2
through
11
of
clerk's
record
600.
there
is
simply
no
question,
we
respectfully
submit,
in
this
case
that
if
there
in
fact
could
have
been
a
damages
claim
the
respondents
made
a
conscious
litigation
decision
not
to
pursue
it,
and
that
was
not
an
unreasonable
determination.
the
district
court,
following
the
first
trial
in
this
case,
following
the
1984
trial,
concluded
that
there
was
no
evidence
to
establish
that
westmoreland
had
lost
any
prospective
or
existing
coal
contracts
because
of
the
state
taxes.
the
district
court
in
the
second
trial
noted,
based
on
testimony
adduced
at
that
trial,
that
there
was,
again,
no
further
evidence
that
westmoreland
had
lost
any
contracts
because
of
these
state
taxes.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
it
did,
your
honor.
it...
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the...
westmoreland
intervened
as
a
defendant
in
1978,
shortly
after
this
matter
was
initiated.
it
crossclaimed
against
the
state,
seeking
a
determination
in
1978
that
the
taxes
were
unlawful.
it
amended
its
crossclaim
in
1983
to
seek
recovery
of
the
taxes
paid
to
the
state
between
1976
and
1982.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that
claim,
your
honor,
was
eventually
dismissed
with
prejudice
as
a
result
of
a
settlement
in
1991.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
no...
there
was
no
other
consideration
given,
your
honor.
the...
westmoreland
at
that
point
in
time
had
a
claim
that
from
the
petitioner's
view
and
i
believe
from
westmoreland's
view
had
zero
value,
because
at
that
point
in
time
it
had
long
since
passed
any...
bypassed
any
opportunity
to
challenge
the
state
taxes
under
state
law.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
and
so
the
50,000
from
its
perspective
was
approximately
50,000
more
than
its
claim
was
worth.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
under
state
law...
first
of
all,
there
are
two
taxes
involved
in
this
question,
in
this
case,
a
gross
proceeds
tax
and
a
severance
tax,
and
there
are
actually
different
protest
procedures
for
each
of
those
taxes,
but
generally
speaking
for
each
tax
the...
westmoreland
was
required
within
a
specific
period
of
time
to
file
a
protest
and
then
with
respect
to
the
gross
proceeds
tax
and
the
severance
tax
for
a
period
of
time
to
initiate
a
lawsuit
in
state
district
court.
it
failed
to
do
that.
the
state
procedures
for
protest
with
respect
to
the
severance
tax
changed
in
1983
retroactive
to
1981,
which
provided
for
a
protest
procedure
and
then
administrative
review
by
the
department
of
revenue
and
a
lawsuit
if
the...
if
westmoreland
was
dissatisfied
with
the
resolution
of
its
claim.
so
again,
the...
by
the
time
the
settlement
agreement
was
entered
into
in
198...
in
1991,
westmoreland's
claim
had,
i
think
from
its
perspective,
zero
value.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
a
negative
answer
is
appropriate.
first,
the
state
of
montana
did
not
take
value
during
the
period
we're
really
concerned
with,
1976
through
1982,
from
the
tribe.
it
took
value
from
westmoreland
resources
in
terms
of
westmoreland's
taxes.
now,
at
that
point
in
time,
the
district
court
found,
and
we
believe
the
record
supports
the
factual
and
legal
conclusion
that
westmoreland
simply
would
not
have
paid
the
19...
paid
taxes
under
the
1976
tribal
taxation
code,
so
it
was
not
as
if
the
state
of
montana--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--that's
correct.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
because,
again,
the
economic
incidence
of
this
tax
was
passed
contractually
through
to
westmoreland's
utility
customers.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
the...
we
would
suggest
that
the
value
of
the
coal
was
the
value...
from
the
tribe's
perspective
was
the
value
that
it
received
under
its
1974
lease
agreement
with
westmoreland.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
your
honor,
again,
i
think
that
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
tribe
has
a
legal
entitlement
to
recovery
of
those
taxes,
even
when
the
taxpayer
itself
does
not.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
if
we
depart
from
common
law
tradition
in
this
regard,
one
must
ask
him
or
herself
the
question
of
why
the
tribe
as
opposed
to
westmoreland,
or
for
that
matter
westmoreland's
customers,
is
more
entitled
to
these
moneys.
westmoreland,
through
the
legal
incidence,
and
westmoreland's
customers
through
the
economic
incidence,
actually
bore
the
burden
of
this
tax.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
they
were,
your
honor.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
correct
and,
your
honor,
indeed,
the
tribe
did
not
make
a
bad
contract.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
i
agree,
and
the
injury
to
the
tribe
in
terms
of
dollars
would,
at
least
in
theory,
have
been
best
quantified
through
a
compensatory
damages
kind
of
claim
and,
as
i've
said
before,
that
is
not
the
kind
of
claim
that
has
ever
been
maintained
in
this
action
and,
indeed,
it
is
the
kind
of
claim
that
the
tribe
and
the
united
states
disclaimed
any
interest
in
pursuing.
the--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--yes.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
and--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--your
honor,
in
fact
the
petitioners
did
not
receive
any
property
of
the
tribe.
the
tribe
conferred
no
benefit
on
the--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--your
honor,
but
following
that--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--your
honor,
we
believe
there
is,
and
we
believe
that
the
common
law
authority
is
united
states
v.
california.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
i
think
westmoreland,
your
honor,
would
have
said
was...
it
wasn't
consistent,
because
westmoreland
saw
the
1974
lease
amendment
as
the
complete
economic
settlement
between
the
parties.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
the
record
shows
the
tribe
in
fact
did
attempt
to
impose
their
tax,
but
was
prevented
from
doing
so
by
the
department
of
interior.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
because
the
department
had
doubted
the
authority
of
the
tribe
to
tax
offreservation
transactions,
and
the
ceded
strip
is
outside--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--no,
your
honor.
it
was
based
solely
on
the
tribe's
constitution
and
the
department's
interpretation
that
it
did
not
permit
offreservation
taxation.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct,
but
that
was
in
1988,
long
after--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--the
events
we're
concerned
with
occurred,
and
that
decision
was
thereafter
reconsidered
by
the
district
court
in
its
1994
decision,
and
in
essence
the
district
court
stated
that
it
was
not
intended
to
speak
to
any
obligation
that
westmoreland
may
have
had
under
the
1976
tribal
taxation
code.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
it
did
and,
indeed,
westmoreland
made
that
argument,
but
that
is
not
the
argument
that
the
department
of
interior
relied
upon
in
disapproving
the
ordinance.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
it
should
be
a
limitation
between
the
tribe
and
montana
because
the
respondents
are
seeking
a
very
specific
remedy,
westmoreland's
taxes.
that
is
the
remedy
they
have
sought
for
the
last
10
years.
