but
mr.
smith,
why...
i'm
not
following
this
colloquy
between
you
and
justice
souter.
it
seems...
was
the
coal
contracted
for
and
the
price
fixed
between
the
tribe
and
westmoreland
before
the
taxes
were
imposed?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
at
that
point,
it
seems
to
me,
the
value
of
the
coal
to
the
tribe
was
no
more
and
no
less
than
what
it
had
contracted
to
sell
it
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
period.
i
mean,
it
might
be
worth
more
in
the
abstract,
but
if
it
made
a
bad
contract
its
value
to
the
tribe
at
that
point
is
simply
what
it
contracted
to
sell
it
for,
i
assume.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
remedy
was
unavailable
because
it
had
not
been
sought.
is
that
your
position
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
what
that
means.
i
mean,
what
does
that
mean,
that
would
otherwise
go?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
tribe
would
have
taxed
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean,
westmoreland
would
have
paid
it
without
the
department
of
interior
permission
on
the
part
of
the
tribe?
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
don't
you
think
they'd
be
liable
to
their
stockholders
if
they
did
something
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
very
true.
they
didn't
care
who
they
paid
the
taxes
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
still
doesn't
settle
the
question
of
whether
the
tribe
could
have
imposed
the
tax.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
the
reality,
whether
it
was
a
mistake
or
not.
it's
not
a
question
of
why
should--
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
i
mean,
is
that
really
credible?
i
mean,
the
tribe
would
have
come
and
said,
you
know,
this
tax
is
unlawful,
and
we
know
we
can't
get
any
more
royalties
from
you,
we
have
a
deal,
and
we
know
we
can't
tax
you
because
we've
been
told
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior
he
won't
give
permission,
and
westmoreland
says,
oh,
that's
okay,
i'll
give
you
the
38
million
instead
of
the
state.
that's
fine
with
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
quite
different
statement,
any
additional
payments
to
you
will
have
to
be
in
lieu
of
instead
of
in
addition
to,
and
you
characterize
that
as
a
sort
of
volunteering
to
give
you
the
money
that
we
save
from
the
tax?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
so
now
they're
willing
to
share
it.
that's
a
deal
that
i
think
the
company
might
cut.
that
is
plausible.
if
you
get
montana
off
our
back,
we'll
give
you
19
of
the
38
million.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
more
plausible,
but
you've
already
cut
your
claim
by
50
percent
now.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
sounds...
this--
--you're
writing
all
of
this
from
cases,
moreover,
in
which
the
restitution
is
being
made
to
the
person
from
whom
the
money
was
taken.
in
this
case,
it
would
have
been
the
corporation
and
not
the
tribe,
and
i
think
to
simply
use
the
same
burden
of
proof
rules
in
this
very
different
situation
is
unreasonable.
it
is,
indeed,
reasonable
to
presume
that
the
whole
amount
of
wrongfully
acquired
money
goes
back
to
the
person
whom
you
took
it
from,
and
the
burden
would
be
on
benvenuto
cellini
to
show
that
in
fact
he
gave
added
value
to
the
lump
of
gold
that
he
had
stolen.
that's
very
reasonable.
but
where
you're
asking
us
to
give
the
money
to
a
third
party,
not
to
the
person
from
whom
it
was
taken,
it
seems
to
me
the
burden
of
proof
should
be
on
that
third
party
to
show
that
i
was
injured
by
this
taking
from
somebody
else.
don't
you...
doesn't
that
seem
reasonable
to
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
us
to
assume
automatically
that
the
tribe
was
injured
38
million
worth.
