mr.
smith,
i'd
like
to
pursue
with
you
what
you
assert
is
the
underlying
cause
of
action
here.
is
it
for
some
kind
of
breach
of
tribal
sovereignty,
some
federal
cause
of
action,
or
is
it
limited
to
a
cause
of
action
for
money
had
and
received
based
on
an
implied
contract?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
interesting,
because
i
thought
it
had
been
determined
in
earlier
litigation
that
there
was
a
federal
cause
of
action
here
based
on
a...
an
invasion
of
tribal
sovereignty
and
a
preemption
by
federal
law
of
any
state
tax
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
thought
we
had
basically
summarily
affirmed
that
notion.
now,
is
that
right
or
wrong?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
are
we
dealing
here
in
this
suit
with
what
remedy
is
appropriate
based
on
that
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it's
been
determined
that
there
is
some
breach
of
tribal
sovereignty
by
the
state
of
montana,
and
if
what
we
at
bottom
are
faced
with
here
is
what's
the
remedy,
then
i
think
your
argument
might
focus
on
what
should
be
the
remedy,
and
it's
entirely
possible
to
me
that
it
shouldn't
be
just
a
disgorgement
of
all
the
taxes
but,
rather,
a
requirement
that
the
court
would
have
to
look
at
what
injury
was
suffered
by
the
tribe
in
crafting
the
amount
of
the
remedy.
is
that
an
argument
you
make,
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
the
big
difference,
of
course,
is
that
in
u.s.
v.
california
the
suit
was
based
on
money
had
and
received,
which
this
court
said
required
finding
an
implied
contract,
and
the
tax
was
found
to
have
violated
state
law.
state
law.
here,
you've
got
in
earlier
litigation
resolved
in
crow
ii
a
determination,
affirmed
by
this
court,
that
the
montana
law
violated
tribal
sovereignty
and
was,
indeed,
preempted
by
federal
law.
now,
that
is
a
different
cause
of
action,
and
maybe
will
give
rise
to
some
right
for
compensatory
damages.
i
think
u.s.
v.
california
on
that
basis
is
distinguishable.
how
would
you
say
it
is
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you've
got
a
separate
cause
of
action
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
it
too
late?
maybe
what
needs
to
be
done
is
to
vacate
and
remand,
so
that
the
court
can
address
what
is
the
appropriate
remedy.
the
court
may
well
have
found
an
improper
remedy,
just
lumping
all
the
taxes
together
and
saying,
fine,
you
get
it,
but
they're
probably
entitled
to
something
if
they
can
establish
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no.
they're
talking
about
some
remedy
against
the
state
of
montana,
which...
and
it
is
the
state
of
montana
by
its
law
that
is
said
to
have
violated
tribal
sovereignty,
not
westmoreland.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
the
tribe
is
saying,
though
that,
but
for
the
subsequently
enacted
tax,
that
westmoreland
would
have
taken
more
coal
out
and
been
able
to
sell
more
and
they
would
have
gotten
more
royalties
and
what's
more
maybe
there
was
some
other
land
they
could
have
leased
out
for
coal
removal,
but
because
of
montana's
tax
they
weren't
able
to
do
it.
but
that
doesn't
equate
automatically
with
the
amount
of
montana's
tax,
it
seems
to
me.
i
still
think
we
need
to
pursue
what
really
is
the
injury
to
the
tribe
in
terms
of
dollars.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
was
a
subsequent
district
court
decision
saying
that
in
fact
it
was
part...
the
ceded
land
was
part
of
the
reservation
and
the
tribe
did
have
the
power
to
tax,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
pelcyger,
why
shouldn't
the
remedy
be
tailored
to
the
damages
suffered
by
the
tribe?
in
other
words,
the
loss
to
the
tribe
of
royalties
that
it
otherwise
would
have
had
if
more
coal
had
been
taken
by
westmoreland
and
sold,
or
other
revenues
that
it
might
have
derived
if
other
people
had
not
been
discouraged
by
the
amount
of
montana's
unlawful
tax
from
making
lease
arrangements
with
the
tribe?
i
don't
see
why
the
measure
of
damages
should
automatically
be
the
amount
of
the
taxes
collected
by
montana.
i
think
it
should
be
directed
to
the
tribe's
injuries.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'd
like
you
to
answer
that
question.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
shouldn't
it
be
measured
by
your
injury?
i
would
appreciate
your
answering
that
question
before
we
go
on
to
other
things.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
not
only
that,
the
tribe's
tax
was
25
percent,
montana's
was
35
percent,
so
even
if
the
tribe
could
have
taxed,
it
wasn't
going
to
tax
it
the
same
amount.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
this...
we're
just
addressing
what
the
injury
is.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
it's
not
too
late.
we
have
to
look
now
in
this
case
at
whether
the
remedy
of
disgorgement
of
all
of
the
taxes
and
handing
it
over
to
the
tribe
is
correct
as
a
matter
of
federal
law.
maybe
it's
not.
maybe
it
ought
to
be
sent
back
so
we
can
look
at
what
the
injury
to
the
tribe
was.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
tribe's
position
was
that
had
there
been
no
heavy
montana
tax,
that
westmoreland
would
have
been
able
to
take
and
sell
more
coal,
which
would
have
generated
more
royalties
to
the
tribe.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
as
to
that...
as
to
that,
the
tribe
had
entered
into
an
agreement
before
there
were
any
taxes
by
either
montana
or
the
tribe,
or
the
amount
of
the
royalties
it
wanted
and
would
accept,
and
so
it's
hard
to
understand
how
the
subsequent
imposition
of
a
tax
which
was
passed
on
to
the
consumers
by
westmoreland
alters
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
at
a
time...
at
a
time
when
the
tribe
was
not
permitted
to
impose
its
own
tax,
it's
hard
to
equate
that
with
the
direct
injury.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
exactly.
well...
yes.
i
mean,
that's
the
whole
point,
and
why
shouldn't
this
be
sent
back
to
determine
what
was
the
injury
to
the
tribe?
i...
this
business
of
equating
it
automatically
with
the
amount
of
the
tax
i
just
don't
understand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
tribal
tax.
the
amount
of
the--
