could
i
ask,
about
that
settlement...
it
really
puzzles
me.
they
had
a
claim
for
millions
of
dollars,
as
i
remember
it,
and
they
settled
for
50,000.
was
there
some
other
consideration
given
to
westmoreland
in
that
settlement,
other
than
50,000?
it
seems
very
strange.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
state
statute
of
limitations
in
effect
had
run
on
its
ability
to
recover.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
they
had
the
consent
of
the
secretary
of
interior.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
a
little
different
than
this
one.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
in
that
connection,
assume
that
westmoreland
had
not
been
tardy
in
making
its
claim
for
a
refund
and
it
had
promptly
filed
a
claim
for
a
refund
and
all
of
the
money
had
been
refunded
to
westmoreland,
would
you
still
be
able
to
maintain
precisely
the
same
claim
that
you're
now
maintaining?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
violated
was
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution,
wasn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
wasn't
exactly
a
bystander
when
it
got
back
all
the
money
in
escrow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
did
get
a...
didn't
they
get
something
back,
westmoreland?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
theory,
i
take
it
you
disagree
with
your
colleague
on
the
same
side,
is
that
if
westmoreland
had
recovered
all
the
tax
itself,
then
the
tribe
would
not
be
able
to
get
any
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
they
would
have
been
able
to
recover
this
money
from
westmoreland
if
westmoreland
had
recovered
it
from
montana?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what...
why
was
westmoreland
a
wrongdoer?
i
mean,
they
have
to
have
done
something
wrong
to
give
up
several
million
dollars,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
amount
of
the
tribal
tax
is
not
equal
to
the
amount
of
the--
