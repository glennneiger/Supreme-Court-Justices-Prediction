mr.
smith,
may
i
ask
you
to
clarify
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
inquiry?
i
understood
your
brief
to
say
it's
not
a
question
of
one
government
receiving
the
tax
versus
the
other,
like
one
county
getting
what
belonged
to
another
county.
i
think
your
position
was
that
even
if
there
had
been
no
tax
by
the
state
of
montana
there
could
not
have
been
a
tax
by
the
tribe
instead,
because
it
didn't
have
the
requisite
federal
permission
in
the
years
in
question,
is
that
correct?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's
not
like
getting
benefits
that
should
have
gone
to
you
that
went
to
somebody
else,
but
your
position
is
that
it
would
have
been...
the
tribe
could
not
have
gotten
the
tax.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
when
you
say
with
respect
to
westmoreland
you
mean
with
respect
to
that
operation,
not
suing...
the
tribe
suing
westmoreland,
i
take
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
is
the
state's
procedure?
must
you
protest
within
a
certain
amount
of
time,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
did
westmoreland
fail
to
do
that
made
its
claim,
as
you
say,
worthless?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
don't
follow
that.
they
didn't
have
permission
from
the
department
of
interior
for
those
years,
and
at
least
mr.
smith
took
the
position
that...
both
on
brief
and
before
us
that,
even
if
montana
hadn't
tried
to
tax
any
part
of
this,
the
tribe
could
not
without
the
secretary's
permission,
which
it
didn't
have
in
those
years.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
wasn't
the
price
set...
wasn't
the
price
set
before
the
tax
was
imposed?
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
lamken,
something
happened
in
the
district
court,
and
the
district
court
thought,
i'm
supposed
to
do
something
equitable,
and
that
seems
to
have
been
forgotten
by
everybody,
that
here
was
a
district
judge,
he
said,
i'm
going
to
consider
the
factors
on
both
sides.
and
one
of
the
things
that
he
said
he
thought
might
be
relevant...
i
hope
i
remember
this
correctly...
was
from
day
one
the
tribe
could
have
stopped
montana
because
the
tribe
is
not
blocked
by
the
antiinjunction
act,
so
he's
kind
of
mixing
all
the
equities.
so...
but
he
did
take
into
account
a
lot
of
the
things
that
we
have
been
talking
about.
where
did
he
go
wrong
if
we
don't
buy
your
theory
that
you
start
with
every
penny
that
montana
got
and
then,
if
we
don't
buy
that,
what's
wrong
with
what
the
district
judge
did?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that
was
much,
much
later.
in
the
years
that
we're
talking
about,
'75
to
'82,
none
of
that
was
settled.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
even
'82
was
the
end
of
this
period.
we're
talking
about
'75
to
'82.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
if
the
united
states
didn't
give
the
tribe
permission
to
tax
in
'75,
could
a
decision
by
a
court
saying,
oh,
united
states,
you
should
have
authorized
the
tax,
that
the
tribe
meant
to
reach
back
7
years
and
say,
taxpayer,
now
cough
up?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
where
does
it
say
that
westmoreland
would
have
been
bound
to
pay
the
tribe
because
all
those
years
later
a
court
said,
gee,
we
got
it
wrong
the
first
time,
or
the
secretary
got
it
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
about
the
tax
injunction
act,
that
the
tribe
is
in
an
advantageous
position
with
respect
to
that,
it
can
do
what
others
can't
do?
it
didn't.
why
at
no
point
didn't
the
united
states
and
the
tribe
think
about
enjoining
montana
from
collecting
this
unlawful
tax?
