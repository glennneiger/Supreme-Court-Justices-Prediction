mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
i'd
like
to
start
by
addressing
some
of
the
questions
that
were
raised
by
the
court
to
mr.
smith.
first,
i'd
like
briefly
to
refer
to
rule
54(c)
of
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
states
that
every
final
judgment
shall
grant
the
relief
to
which
the
party
in
whose
favor
it
is
rendered
is
entitled,
even
if
the
party
has
not
demanded
such
relief
in
the
party's
pleadings.
that's
quoted
at
page
24
and
footnote
18
of
our
brief.
i'd
also
like
to
bring
the
court's
attention
to
the
district
court's
1990
interlocutory
decision,
also
quoted
in
that
same
footnote.
it's
in
the
petitioner's
appendix
at
pages
74
to
76.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
footnote
18,
page
24,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
which
the
district
court
denied
the
motion...
this
was
in
1990,
long
before
the
trial
in
this
case,
in
which
the
district
court
denied
montana's
motion
to
dismiss,
stating
that
the
current
phase
of
this
case
was
an
extension
of
the
district
court's
previously
invoked
equity
jurisdiction
and
that,
once
violations
of
significant
tribal
interest
were
established,
the
district
court
had
"broad
equitable
powers"
that
refers...
broad
equitable
powers
to
construct
a
remedy
that
refers
to
state
law
and
is
not
defeated
by
it,
so
it
was
known
throughout
this
litigation
what
this
case
was
about,
and
this
is
not
a
pleading
case.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
let
me
say
first
that
that's
not
the
question
that's
presented.
the
question
presented
was--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i
would
be
glad
to
answer
that
question
and
i'm
glad
you
asked
it.
the
court
of
appeals
held
twice,
both
in
crow
ii
and
in
crow
iv,
that
montana's
illegal
coal
taxes,
quote,
took
revenues
that
would
otherwise
go
towards
supporting
the
tribe
and
its
programs.
that
was
with
reference
to
the
coal
that
was
actually
mined,
not
the
coal--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--it
means
that
westmoreland--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--the
tribe
would
have
taxed
it.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
the
tribe
could
have
taxed
it,
your
honor,
and
let
me
also
say
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
question
that
this
court
held
in
the
case
of
hickory
apache
tribe...
marian
v.
hickory
apache
tribe
that
in
the
absence
of
an
expressed
waiver
of
the
sovereign
right
to
tax,
the
tribe
could
go
back...
the
circumstances
there
were
virtually
identical
and
the
tribe
could
go
back
and
impose
taxes
after
entering
into
a
mineral
lease,
so
that
issue
was
resolved
by
this
court.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
they
had
the
consent
of
the
secretary
of
interior,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
that's
a...
perhaps
a
complicating
factor
or
a
distraction,
depending
upon
how
it's
viewed.
but
what
the
record
shows
here
clearly
and
unmistakably,
the
first
thing,
justice
o'connor,
that
needs
to
be
looked
at
is
what
has
actually
happened
in
the
absence
of
the
state
tax.
the
state
tax
was
held
invalid
in
1987
in
crow
ii,
summarily
affirmed
by
this
court
in
1988.
since
that
time,
the
tribe
has,
in
fact,
received
100
percent
of
the
state...
of
taxes
measured
precisely
by
the
amount
of
the
state
severance
and
gross
proceeds
taxes,
so
the
best
evidence
of
what
would
have
happened
but
for
the
state
taxes
is
what
actually
did
happen.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
this
is
not
a
case
between
the
tribe
and
westmoreland.
this
is
a
case...
this
is...
in
order
to
recover
against
the
state...
westmoreland's
not
the
wrongdoer.
the
state
is
the
wrongdoer.
we're
seeking
to
recover
not
against
westmoreland.
we're
seeking
to
recover
against
the
state
of
montana.
i
see
no
reason
why
recovery
against
the
state--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i'm
trying
to...
i'm
trying
to
answer...
i'm
trying
to
answer
the
question.
the
record
shows
that
montana...
and
this
is
clear
by
the
testimony
of
montana's
president,
and
it's
clear
by
a
1976
letter
that
is
in
the
record
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
87
where
westmoreland
says,
and
it's
position
from
the
beginning
was
that
it
was
willing
to
pay
one
tax,
not
two,
it
didn't
matter
to
westmoreland
who
it
paid
the
taxes
to,
and
that
westmoreland
was
willing
to
pay
the
tribe
any
additional
payments
that
the
tribe
was
exempt
from
by
virtue
of
its
status
and
by
virtue
of
its
sovereignty.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
below,
relying
on
that
1976
letter
which
was
quoted
in
the
court
of
appeals
decision.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
i
can't
speak
for
westmoreland,
but--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--your
honor,
the
record
shows,
and
again
it's
very
clear
on
this
point,
westmoreland
recognized
what
the
traffic
bore
for
montana
coal
after
1975.
westmoreland
recognized
that
one
way
or
another
it
was
going
to
have
to
pay,
whether
in
the
form
of
increased
royalties
or
taxes,
that
additional
amount
of
money.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
right.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
but
again
the
question
is,
why...
the
secretary
of
interior
made
a
mistake.
assume
the
secretary
of
the
interior
made
a
mistake.
now,
in
fact
the
tax
was
approved
as
to
reservation
coal
and
it
was
subsequently
determined
that
this
coal
was
reservation
coal.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
under--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--well,
montana,
of
course,
was
free
to
defend
on
that
ground,
that
there
was
a
disparity
and,
indeed,
the
law
of
restitution
recognizes
that
if
there
is
a
gross
disparity
between
the
unlawful
gain
and
the
amount...
restitution
does
not
exist
in
order
to
give
plaintiffs
an
unjust
enrichment,
and
montana
was
free
to
argue
that.
in
fact,
they
did
not
argue
that,
not
at
all.
what
montana
argued
was
that
we
provided
services
to
all
the
crow
members,
the
same
services
they
would
have
received
in
the
absence
of
this--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--the
critical
question
here
is
what
would
have
happened
in
the
absence
of
the
state's
unlawful
taxes,
and
whether
or
not
the
tribe
might
have
been
able
to
recover
against
westmoreland
is
beside
the
point.
the
question
is,
what
would
have
happened
but
for
the
state
taxes,
and
the
record--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--of
course,
that's
not
our
situation.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
but
i
believe
yes,
we
would,
your
honor,
and
the
reason
is
that
the
court's...
the
remedial
powers
of
this
court
should
be
guided
primarily
here
by
the
purposes
of
the
statute
that
was
violated,
but
the
purposes
of
the
statute
here
were
not
to
benefit
westmoreland.
it
was
not
to
give
westmoreland
a
competitive
advantage
visavis
other
coal
producers.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
no.
what
was
violated...
and
the
commerce
clause
of
the
constitution
was
not
violated.
in
fact,
this
court
in
commonwealthedison
specifically
upheld
this
same
tax
as
applied
to
federal
coal.
what
was
violated
here
was
the
tribe's
sovereignty
and
the
indian
mineral
leasing
act
under
which
the
tribe's
minerals
are
leased,
not
the
federal
minerals,
or
not
other
people's
minerals.
so
this
is
unique
to
the
tribes,
and
the
purpose...
this
is
a
very,
very
unique
tax,
because
the
tax...
sorry.
this
is
a
very
unique
statute
under
which
the
tax
was
held
invalid,
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
not
to
protect
the
taxpayer.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
protect
the
tribe.
westmoreland,
the
taxpayer,
was
a
bystander,
caught
in
a
big
conflict,
in
the
middle
of
a
conflict
between
three
sovereigns,
federal,
state,
and
tribal.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
no,
but
it
was...
no.
well,
it
didn't
get
back...
no,
the
tribe
got
the
money
that
was
in
escrow,
your
honor,
not
westmoreland.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
so--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--no.
westmoreland
just
got
the
50,000
that
you
referred
to.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
so
you
have
to
look
at
the
purpose
of
the
federal
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
federal
statute
was
not
to
confer
a
benefit
on
the
taxpayer.
ordinarily,
when
taxes
are
held
invalid
the
automatic
assumption
is,
the
taxes
were
held
invalid,
the
taxpayer
gets
to
get
the
money
back
because
the
taxes
were
invalid,
but
here
the
sole
and
exclusive
intended
beneficiary
of
the
laws
that
were
violated
was
the
tribe,
it
wasn't
westmoreland,
and
for
westmoreland
to
escape
with
no
taxes
whatsoever
would
not
be
a
result
that
is
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
the
statute
and
would
not
effectuate
the
purposes
of
the
statute--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--there
was
not...
there
was
a
provision
for
renegotiation
of
royalties,
but
on
specific
dates.
i
think
the
first
one
was
10
years
after
the
original
lease,
not
in
1975.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
because
the
lease
was
entered
into
in
1974,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
i--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--that's
right,
and
westmoreland
testified
it
didn't
make
any
difference.
they
passed
on
both
the
royalties--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--i
can't
predict
what
would
have
happened
under
those
circumstances.
what
i
can
say
is
that
the
record
before
this
court--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--the
royalty
was
set--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--before
the
tax
was
imposed.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
that
was--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--yes.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
well,
let
me
just
say,
the
record
leaves
no
doubt
that
but...
and
this
is
clear
from
westmoreland's
testimony,
that
but
for
the
state
taxes
they
would
have
paid
the
same
amount
of
money
to
the
tribe.
they
were
not
looking...
westmoreland
was
not
looking
to
try
to
get
something
cheaper
than
the
market
conditions.
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
that's
part
of
the
position,
your
honor.
there
are
two
different
discrete
claims
of
injury
here,
both
of
which
were
found
by
the
lower
courts.
the
first
discrete
claim
relates
to
the
coal
that
was
actually
produced
and
sold,
and
there
the
claim
is
the
tribe
was
deprived
of
its
fair
share
of
the
economic
rent.
in
addition
to
that,
there's
a
claim
with
regard
to...
or
an
injury
with
regard
to
the
coal
that
was
not
sold
because
the
price
was
too
high
because
of
the
state's
tax.
there's
no
damages
sought
now
on
the
basis
of
that
second
category,
but
the
first
category
is
what
we're
talking
about,
and
that's
what
the
focus
is
on.
now,
let
me
just
say
one
other
thing.
there's
no
reason--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--well,
again,
the
lease
just
dealt
with
royalties.
the
tribe
is
both
the
owner
of
the
coal
and
the
sovereign.
let
me
just
make
one
thing
real
clear.
there's
no
reason--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--well,
the
reason...
the
tribe
was
permitted
to
impose
its
own
tax.
the
secretary
made
a
mistake,
because
the
secretary
didn't
realize
at
the
time
that
the
ceded
strip
coal
was
part
of
the
reservation.
now,
the
question
is,
why
should
the
benefit
of
that
mistake
inure
to
the
wrongdoer?
the
tribe--
mr.
robert
s.
pelcyger
--no,
but
the
question
is,
this
is
a
claim
of
the
tribe
versus
the
wrongdoer.
this
is
a
claim
for
violation
of
the
tribe's
federally
secured
rights.
