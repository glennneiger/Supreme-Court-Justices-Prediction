justice
antonin
scalia
well,
there's
really
no
such
thing
as
an
in
rem
action,
then.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
you
cannot
possibly
adjudicate
the
rights
to
a
particular
piece
of
property.
you
always
have
at
least
50
claimants--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
can
come
in
and
say,
no,
it's
really
mine,
and
this
adjudication
was
for
naught.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
greater
sovereignty
over
the
sea
bed
than
you
have
over
the
dry
land
in
california?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
well--
--i
don't
know
where
the
sovereign
lands
argument
takes
you,
because
if...
to
the
extent
that
you're
going
to
rely
on
sovereign
lands
rather
than
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
period,
it
seems
to
mean
you're
open
to
the
argument
that
the
reason
you've
got
those
lands
is
that
the
congress
of
the
united
states
gave
them
to
you,
and
if
you're
going
to
take
the
benefit
of
those
lands,
presumably
it
would
be
fair
to
say
you
ought
to
take
them
subject
to
the
burden
of
taking
them
without
destroying
the
utility
of
in
rem
actions.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
that.
what...
why?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
do
you
think...
just
to
move
on
there,
i
mean,
there's
a
few
other
issues
in
the
case.
why
do
you
think
this
wreck
has
been
abandoned?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
assume
in
the
old
days,
never
mind
new
technology,
that
a
vessel
goes
down
into
a
coral
reef.
it's
simply...
there's
no
way
to
get
it
up
from
under
the
coral
reef,
and
2
years
later...
so
nobody
tries
to
get
it
up.
2
years
later,
a
hurricane
comes
through,
lifts
it
up,
and
it's
floated
to
the
shore.
has
that
been
abandoned,
and
the
people
who
own
the
ship
and
what's
in
the
ship
have
lost
all
claim
to
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's...
even
if
it's
not
salvageable?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
case
do
you
cite
for
that
proposition?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
must...
the...
if
i
understand,
you're
saying
the
law
requires
you
to
do
what
is
obviously
not
doable,
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
law
requires
a
vain
act.
there's
a
new
proposition
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
certainly
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
here,
i
gather
they
don't
even
know
where
it
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
they're
doing
it
at
night
in
the
dark?
is
that...
why
doesn't
the
state
know
where
these
people
are?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
alford,
i--
--no,
please.
well,
i'm
trying
to
get
him
onto
another
subject.
i'd
like
to
get
him
onto--
justice
antonin
scalia
--abandonment,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why?
i
thought
that
abandonment
was
a
voluntary,
i
don't
want
this
property
any
more.
suppose
i
drop
a
silver
dollar
down
a
grate,
and
i
try
to
bring
it
up
with
a
piece
of
gum
on
a
stick,
and
i
can't
do
it,
and
i
shrug
my
shoulders
and
walk
off
because
i
have
not
gotten
it,
and
then
somebody
comes
up
and
lifts
up
the
grate
and
gets
my
silver
dollar.
is
that
his
silver
dollar?
have
i
abandoned
it
just
because
i
could
not
get
it?
i
still
think
it's
my
silver
dollar.
i
haven't
said,
you
know,
i
don't
want
it
any
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
the
insurance
companies
who
paid
off
the
money
and
who
are
still
in
existence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
how
130
years
makes
any
difference.
if
abandonment
requires
a
voluntary...
a
willing
cessation
of
claim
to
ownership,
it
seems
to
me
that
is
not
demonstra...
and
that's
why
i
always
thought
it
was.
that
is
certainly
not
demonstrated
by
leaving
a
wreck
where
you
cannot
possibly
bring
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
that's
a
different
issue
as
to
whether...
that's
the
issue
of
who
owns
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
not
the
issue
of
whether
the
person
who
owns
it
has
abandoned
it
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
lives
in
being
plus
21
years?
that
sounds
pretty
good.
[laughter]
i
don't
think
you
need
answer
that
question.
mr.
alford.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
it
doesn't
have
to
send
a
diver
down.
it
could
just
go
and
drop
a
big
rock.
i
mean,
get
right
above
it
and
drop
a
big
rock
that
says
the
state
owns
this.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
mean,
the
rock
hits
the...
it
lands
right
on
the
deck.
[laughter]
that's
physical.
what
about
putting
a
buoy,
as
divers
often
do.
yes.
putting
a
buoy
on
the
surface,
above
where
the
wreck
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
not
talking
about
possession,
then.
you're
just
simply...
an
assertion
of
ownership.
is
that
the
same
thing
as
possession?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
possession
and
an
assertion
of
ownership
are
two
different
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
mean
subjective.
you
wouldn't
really
insist
that
if
i
had
a
secret
subjective
intent
not
to
abandon
ownership,
but
i...
all
my
actions
suggest
the
contrary,
that
i
have
an
abandonment.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes.
if
i
have
a
secret
intent,
and
i
even...
i
put
a
sign
on
it
that
says,
i
don't
own
this
any
more.
i
don't
care
about
it.
i
have
a
sign
on
it.
but
deep
in
my
heart,
i
really
do
care.
[laughter]
my
real
intent
is
that
i...
you
wouldn't
say
that,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
not.
so
it
isn't
the
subjective
intent
that
matters.
it's
the
objective
manifestations.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
which
way
do
you
treat
it?
you
say
you
treat
it
as
a
unit.
does
that
mean
if
some
of
it
is
not
abandoned,
all
of
it
is
not
abandoned,
or
does
it
mean
that
if
some
of
it
is
abandoned,
all
of
it
is
abandoned?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
reason
to
pick
one
rather
than
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
what's
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
not
against
a
sovereign.
sovereigns
have
covered
this,
haven't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
abandonment
never
applies
against
a
sovereign.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
united
states
might
well
be
on
the
other
side
of
this
issue
if
there
were
not
that
convenient
rule.
