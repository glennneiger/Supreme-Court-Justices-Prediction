well,
but
there
is
some
indication,
isn't
there,
that
when
the
framers
were
drafting
the
constitution
and
when
the
eleventh
amendment
was
adopted
that
it
was
thought
that
certain
types
of
suits
in
admiralty
weren't
covered
by
the
eleventh
amendment
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
prize
cases,
for
example...
and
very
possibly
in
rem
cases
of
this
type,
where
the
state
isn't
in
possession,
as
such,
of
the
property.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
under
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act,
if
it
applies,
if
the
requirements
are
met,
does
that
automatically
then
put
the
state
in
possession
of
the
wreck?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do...
is
that
true
now?
i
mean,
what
has
happened?
is
this
thing
being
explored
now
by
the
respondents,
and
are
people
going
down
on
behalf
of
the
respondents
and
recovering
property?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
would
posting
a
buoy
above
it
be
an
act
of
possession?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
are
you
going
to
talk
about
the
abandonment
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
now,
let's
talk
specifically
about
the
property
here.
the
ship
contained
considerable
property.
only
part
of
it
was
property
that
was
covered
by
insurance,
i
take
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
so
do
we
look
at
specific
pieces
of
property
to
determine
whether
that
property
has
been
abandoned,
or
do
we
treat
it
as
a
whole
somehow?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why?
i
mean,
i
would
think
if
you
have
cargo,
discrete
cargo
and
it
was
different
types
of
things...
you
were
carrying
gold
bullion
that
belonged
to
the
united
states,
and
you
were
carrying
something
else
of
value
that
belonged
to
other
people...
conceivably
you
might
have
some
of
it
abandoned
and
others
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
a
preliminary
finding
of
some
kind?
i
thought
the
district
court
didn't
really
resolve
that
issue.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
do
you
read
the
ninth
circuit
opinion
on
the
abandonment
issue?
did
it
go
further
than
the
district
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if,
in
fact,
this
shipwreck
was
abandoned,
if
at
the
bottom
line
that's
the
finding,
then
your
clients
are
just
out,
i
take
it.
they
get
no
salvage
rights
because
the
federal
act
eliminates
that.
they
get
no
finder's
law,
because
it
eliminates
that.
they're
just
out.
they
will
have
done
all
of
this
work,
made
all
of
this
effort,
and
they
will
get
nothing.
is
that
the
bottom
line
if
the
wreck
is
determined
to
be
abandoned?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
say
it's
all
or
nothing,
that
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
hasn't
abandoned
the
gold
under
legal
theory
means
nothing,
because
we're
going
to
look
at
this
as
one
unit.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it's
just
too
bad
for
the
united
states.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
your
position
was
that
it
can't...
it
isn't
severable,
that
the
abandonment
is
of
the
wreck
and
all
it's
contents,
or
nothing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
all
or
nothing.
that
was
what
you
told
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can't
parcel
it
out.
can't
determine
that
the
gold
bars
belong
to
the
federal
government
and
it's
still
theirs.
can't
do
that.
