justice
david
h.
souter
then
it's
not
an
in
rem
judgment.
the
whole
point,
historically,
of
an
in
rem
judgment
in
these
admiralty
actions
is
that
it
binds
the
world,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
implication
of
what
you're
saying
here
is,
a
state
is
always
part
of
the
world
and,
therefore,
in
any
admiralty
in
rem
action
a
state
could
come
forward
and
say,
got
to
dismiss
it,
eleventh
amendment,
can't
bind
me.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
isn't
the
reason
that
they're
not...
isn't
the
reason
that
you're
not
going
to
file
this
kind
of
an
objection
on,
let's
say,
an
east
coast
salvage
case
is
that
there
is
no
colorable
basis,
in
your
mind
or
anybody
else's,
for
your
doing
so,
for
your
having
a
claim
that
might
be
cut
off
and
therefore
in
fact
adjudicated
by
the
in
rem
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
then
what
would
be
wrong
with
a
rule,
and
maybe
it
would
be
a
softer
rule
than
the
circuit
applied
here,
which
says
you
have
at
least
got
to
come
forward
and
make
a
sufficient
showing
that
you
are
within
the
class
of
those
whose
interests
might,
in
fact,
be
adjudicated
here?
you've
done
that,
in
fact,
in
part
by
what
you've
done
so
far.
after
all,
in
this
case
the
original
in
rem
process
describes
the
location,
so
you
said,
look,
we're
within
the
class
of
those
geographically
that
might
be
affected,
and
what
would
be
wrong
with
carrying
that
one
step
further
and
simply
saying,
all
right,
make
an
equally
colorable
showing
that
you're
also
within
the
class
as
defined
by
other
criteria,
abandonment,
embeddedness,
historic
register?
it
doesn't
mean...
this
rule
would
not
mean
that
you
have
ultimately
to
prove
your
entitlement,
but
it
would
mean
that
you've
got
to
make
a
showing
that
there
is
a
practical
reason
for
stopping
this
in
rem
proceeding,
and
the
reason,
the
justification
for
that
is
to
avoid
the
absurd
situation
in
which,
simply
by
claiming
that
you're
part
of
the
world,
you
could
defeat
any
in
rem
proceeding.
what
would
be
wrong
with
that
rule?
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
i'm
simply...
my
suggestion
was
that
you've
at
least
got
to
come
forward
with
a
basis
for
saying,
yes,
there
is
a
reasonable
basis
for
saying
that
state
interests
are
involved
here,
as
distinct
from
the
case
that
would
occur
if
the
wreck
were
beyond
the
3-mile
limit,
or
the
wreck
were
in
the
gulf
of
mexico,
or
in
europe.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
needs
to
be
a
final
adjudication,
but
i'm
suggesting
that
in
order
to
preserve
the
value
of
in
rem
actions
there
at
least
ought
to
be
a
sufficient
showing
for
the
court...
from
which
the
court
could
conclude
that
you
or
your
state
has
a
serious
interest
implicated
here
that
justifies
recognizing
your
eleventh
amendment
claim
and,
in
effect,
defeating
the
federal
in
rem
action,
that's
all.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
it
implicates
it,
but
it
doesn't
determine
it.
in
other
words,
you've
got
to
come
forward
with
some
evidence.
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
you've
got
to,
in
effect,
present
a
full
case
and
prevail.
justice
david
h.
souter
what's
your
answer
to
the
davis?
as
i
recall,
you
said
in
your
brief,
well,
davis
isn't
on
point,
or...
here
because
the
title
was
not
involved,
but
the
question
is
the
eleventh
amendment
applicability,
and
i
would
suppose
that
there's
an
eleventh
amendment
violation
or
not
an
eleventh
amendment
violation
regardless.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
should
that
make
a
difference
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
regardless
of
what's
being
adjudicated
you're
saying
we
have
the
right
to
an
eleventh
amendment
immunity
even
though
we
weren't
in
possession
and
even
though
it
is
in
rem.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
would
not
have
prevailed
in
that
case,
there's
at
least
a
pretty
fair
argument
that
it's
unlikely
that
the
concept
of
sovereign
immunity
recognized
in
the
eleventh
amendment
for
state
purposes
would,
in
fact,
be
somehow
more
powerful
or
broader.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
that
as
a
distinction.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
do
you
take
the
position
that
state
sovereign
immunity
in
fact
is
broader
than
federal
sovereign
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
how
about
a
yes
or
no,
and
then
explain?
[laughter]
do
you
take
the
position
that
state
sovereign
immunity
is,
in
fact,
a
broader
concept
than
federal
sovereign
immunity?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
there
any
indication
that
the
concept
of
sovereign
immunity
understood
at
the
time
of
the
davis
was
in
fact
a
weaker
concept
under
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
it's
on
the--
--all
property
in
california
is
on
the
sovereign
land
of
the
state
of
california.
i
mean,
so
any
in
rem
action
against
any
piece
of
property
in
california
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about,
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
is
my...
i...
coeur
d'alene
is
fine,
but
i
mean,
is
there
something
wrong
with
the,
kind
of
the
equity
argument
that
i
just
made
that
if
you're
going
to
depend
on
sovereign
lands
i
think
you've
got
to
take
the
burden
as
well
as
the
benefit?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
burden
is
that
you
are
going
to
be
subject
to
some
incidents
of
in
rem
jurisdiction.
maybe
that
incident
is
that
you're
going
to
lose
your
title,
and
you
don't
have
an
eleventh
amendment
claim
if
you're
not
in
possession.
maybe
that
incident
is
that
you're
going
to
have
to
make
at
least
a
colorable
showing
that
you
are
in
a
position
at
least
to
claim
an
interest
subject
to
eleventh
amendment
protection.
but
whatever
the
burden
is,
the
argument
is
that
you
got
the
sovereign
lands
from
the
united
states,
they
weren't
your
historical
entitlement,
and
you
ought
to
take
them
subject
to
this
burden.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
the
reason
is
that
you
got
this
boon
out
of
congress
in
1953,
and
presumably
congress
did
not
intend
to
destroy
the
utility
of
in
rem
admiralty
actions
in
the
course
of
doing
it.
that's
the
answer.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
don't
want
to
go
the
whole
hog
and
say
that
in
fact
there
simply
is
no
eleventh
amendment
applicability
to
an
admiralty
in
rem
action?
justice
david
h.
souter
a
possession
rule.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
they
had
located
them,
and
had
sent
a
diver
down
affixing
a
sign
saying,
claimed
by
the
state,
that
would
be
enough
for
the
possession
rule,
would
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
can
we
infer
a
voluntary
relinquishment
simply
on
the
basis
of
insufficient
activity
to
pursue
the
claim?
in
other
words,
i
don't...
i
assume
i
don't
have...
one
way
to
abandon
would
be
to
stand
there
and
say,
i
wash
my
hands
of
it.
i
want
nothing
more
to
do
with
it.
but
another
way,
i
suppose,
would
be
simply
to
do
nothing
for
too
long
a
period
of
time
in
which
the
relinquishment
would
be
inferred.
do
you
agree
there?
