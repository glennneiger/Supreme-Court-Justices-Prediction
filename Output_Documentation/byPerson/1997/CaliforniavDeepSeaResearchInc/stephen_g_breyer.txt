okay.
just
want
to
be--
--i
am
just
curious
about
the
practical
effects
of
this.
what
is
supposed
to
happen
in
respect
to
all
of
the
ships
or
other
pieces
of
property
that
for
the
last
200
years
admiralty
courts
have
adjudicated
the
title
of
in
rem?
are
all
of
those
adjudications,
past,
present,
and
future,
now
not
final
because
any
one
of
50
sovereigns
can
say,
we
weren't
bound?
and
my
related
question
is,
what's
supposed
to
happen
in
bankruptcy
proceedings,
another
instance,
i
take
it,
where
every
day
courts
decide
who
owns
property
as
of
against
the
world?
are
now
all
those
property
decisions
up
for
grabs?
what
do
title
insurance
companies
do
or
say?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
title
companies...
i'm
interested
in
that
because,
of
course,
the
title
insurance
companies
often
raise
rates
a
lot
when
there's
just
a
theoretical
objection,
so
i'm
quite
interested.
i
don't
want
to
stop
you.
i
want
to
encourage
you
to--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
your
answer,
your
answer
to
justice
scalia...
because
he's
saying
voluntary
abandonment.
you're
arguing
for
two
things,
voluntary
abandonment
or
the
passage
of
time.
now,
you
said
130
years,
but
apparently
with
his
grate
it's
just
3
minutes,
and
you
seem
to
make
some...
quite
a
lot
of
that,
and
i
want
to
know
what
the
standard
is
precisely.
is
it
the
2-year
hurricane?
is
it
the
3
minutes
at
the
grate?
is
it
130
years?
exactly,
in
your
view,
when
does
the
passage
of
time,
in
and
of
itself,
amount
to
an
abandonment?
what's
the
standard?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
give
me
a
hint.
what's
the
legal--
[laughter]
what's
the
legal
standard?
we'll
have
to
write
something.
there
has
to
be
something
in
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
the
park
service
that
they
quote
in
the
amicus
brief?
the
park
service
in
the
house
report
say
that
you
could
indicate
that
intent
in
one
of
two
ways
at
least.
there
may
be
others.
but
one
way
is
that
you
never
assert
any
control
and,
of
course,
there
they
couldn't
do
it.
the
technology
wasn't
there.
and
the
other
way
was
not
otherwise
indicating
a
claim,
i.e.,
you
didn't
mark
it.
and
i
guess,
suppose
100
years
passes
and
nobody
says
anything.
they
don't
have
to
get
a
submarine,
but
they
could
at
least
announce,
you
know,
put
a
buoy
up
or
do
something,
and
if
they
don't
have
to
do
anything
like
that,
how
would
we
ever
decide
these
cases?
there
could
be
a
million
heirs.
you
know,
there
could
be
10
million
heirs
from
the
year
1520,
each
of
which
owns
a
nickel's
worth
of
gold.
i
mean,
why
don't
you
have
to
at
least
say
that
you
want
to
keep
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
evidence
is,
they
never
marked
it.
the
evidence
is,
130
years
passed,
and
not
only
didn't
they
go
there,
which
is
understandable,
but
they
never
even
said
to
anybody,
even
in
their
annual
report,
or
even
passing
it
down
by
family
tradition,
or
even
putting
up
a
buoy
or
a
flag,
they
did
none
of
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
we
have
a
rule
like
the
ninth
circuit
rule,
which
is
bothering
me,
what
we
do
about
the
ninth
circuit's
statement?
their
statement
seems
to
be
that
if
a
long
time
passes,
hundreds
of
years,
and
nobody
does
anything,
it's
not
abandoned.
now,
if
that's
the
rule,
then
i
guess
once
we
announce
it
you
won't
have
problems
with
people
coming
forward.
maybe
i
have
a
claim.
who
knows?
there
may
be
thousands
of
people
who
have
little
bits
of
claims,
and
they'll
all
come
forward.
why
do
we
think
any
bit
of
this
was
abandoned?
and
so
why
do
we
think
there's
parts
that
wasn't
abandoned?
they
just
don't
know
they
have
a
right
to
it
yet,
but
they'll
know.
now,
my
question
is,
am
i
right
in
that
worry,
and
if
so,
what
do
you
think
we
should
do
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
somebody's
great-great-grandmother
had
some
cargo
and
she
left
a
will,
and
those
things
can
be
traced.
i
overstated
hundreds.
it's
only
130,
135
years
ago,
whatever,
and
those
things
can
be
traced
through
wills
and
so
forth.
it's
those
thousands
of
people
now,
perhaps
divided
as
property
passed
intestate.
it's
those,
not
millions
of
people
but
hundreds
or
thousands
that
might
come
forward.
that's
my
worry.
