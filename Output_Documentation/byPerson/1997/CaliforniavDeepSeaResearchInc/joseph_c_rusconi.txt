mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
action
below
was
one
in
rem
by
a
private
party
to
try
title
as
against
all
the
world
and
for
exclusive
salvage
rights
to
a
vessel
lying
upon
the
sovereign
submerged
lands
of
the
state
of
california.
in
this
situation,
california
claims
title
and
rights
to
salvage
over
that
same
vessel,
and
the
eleventh
amendment
prevents
the
adjudication
of
california's
interests
in
this
case
without
its
consent.
under
this
court's
eleventh
amendment
jurisprudence,
the
guiding
principle
in
these
cases
is
the
effect
of
the
relief
requested
on
the
state.
this
conclusion
is
not
dependent
upon
formalisms
or
upon
the
manipulation
of
captions
or
pleadings.
had
this
suit
been
in
personam
against
the
state
under
the
same
circumstances
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
suit
would
have
been
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
this
result
cannot
be
changed
by
the
substitution
of
the
vessel
as
defendant
for
the
state
of
california.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
no,
that's--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--justice
scalia--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--justice
scalia,
all
we're
asking
in
this
case
is
that
the
state
be
dismissed.
now,
they
can
move
forward
in
this
with
an
in
rem
judgment
against
the
rest
of
the
world.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
justice
souter,
i
believe
that
is
what
we
are
saying.
however,
the
practical
effect
of
that,
states
are
not
going
to
run
around
willy
nilly
and
make
these
type
of
claims.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
that
will
be
the
practical
effect,
yes.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
justice
souter,
the
problem
with
that
rule
is
that
by
inquiring
into
the
location,
inquiring
into
the
issues
that
you
mentioned,
you're
adjudicating
the
merits
of
the
claim.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
i
understand,
justice
souter,
but
i
do
not
see
as
a
practical
matter
how
this
inquiry
that
you're
talking
about
about
preliminary
matters
cannot
but
implicate
a
question
on
the
merits,
and
this
is
what--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--we
think
that
the...
the
state
of
california
thinks
that
the
broad
concept
of
sovereign
immunity
in
the
eleventh
amendment
means
that
even
the
type
of
preliminary
inquiry
that
you're
asking
for
is
forbidden.
now,
when
a
state--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--well,
your
honor,
we
don't
think
we're
destroying
the
utility
of
in
rem
actions.
there
has...
this...
there
has
not
been
a
history
of
states
making
unsubstantiated
claims
based
on
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
it's
certainly
not
the
case
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
i--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--your
honor,
since
the
early
cases,
which
we
do
not
believe
stand
for
the
citation
by
the
other
parties
in
this
case,
those
cases
did
not
involve
in
rem
actions
at
all,
or
possession
was
not
central
to
the
holding.
in
this
case,
title
is
being...
is
going
to
be
adjudicated
against
the
state
in
this
in
rem
action.
in
this
case,
its
regulatory
authority
has
been
infringed
by
the
orders
of
the
district
court,
as--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--yes,
we
do.
that
case
was
not
an
in
rem
action.
that
case
was
an
in
personam
action
by
rival
claimants
against
the
executrices
of
the
estate
of
the
ex
state
treasurer.
now,
in
that
case,
when
you
look
at
justice
marshall's
quote
about
the
state
not
being
able
to
sit
back
and
then
destroy
this
ongoing
action,
that
makes
sense.
normal
principles
of
estoppel
would
not
bind
the
state
on
a
judgment
in
an
in
personam
case
when
they're
not
named,
and
so
there's
no
problem.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
well,
yes,
title
was
not
involved
in
the
davis,
and
that
involved--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--because--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--that's
correct.
in
the
davis
the
title
to
the
cargo
was
not
at
issue,
and
it
also
involved
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states,
so
it's
not
an
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
in
this
case
we
have--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--well,
i
believe
that
the
cases
have
diverged
on
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
that
is
given
to
the
states
versus
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
i
believe
that
under
the...
let
me...
i
think
the
best
way
to
answer
that
is,
under
this
court's--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--i
think
it
is
broader
in
that
the
congress
can
change
the
immunity,
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states.
however,
congress
cannot
change
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
in
that
way--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--no.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
i...
but
i
also
want
to
add
that
we're
talking
here
about
a
vessel
that
is
on
the
sovereign
lands
of
the
state
of
california,
and
whose
title
is
being
tried,
and
whose...
the
state
is
not
making
a
bound...
a
baseless
claim
in
this
case,
and
the
recent
jurisprudence
of
this
court--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--perhaps
i
misunderstand
your
question.
not
all
property
within
our
jurisdiction
is
the
sovereign
lands
of
the
state
of
california.
those
are...
these
are
lands
that
were
granted
according
to
the...
by
the
submerged
lands
act.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
it
is
held
subject
to
a
public
trust,
a
unique
trust
that
all
sovereign
lands
in
the
state
of
california
are
held
that
are
not
held,
say,
on
proprietary
lands,
which
may
be
sold,
whereas
sovereign
lands,
it
takes
a
unique
statutory
scheme
to
get
rid
of
them.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
this
is
a
difficult
case,
justice
souter.
however,
just
last
term
in
the
coeur
d'alene
case
the
court
was
very--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--i
don't
see
what
the
burden
is
here.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
a
couple
of
things.
yes,
but
we
did
not
get
them
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
but
why
should
we
be
treated
any
differently
by
the
fact
that
the
lands
were
conveyed
by
the
submerged
lands
act
when
they're
adjacent
to
lands
given
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine?
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
i
understand
your
argument,
justice
souter,
but
california
believes
that
its
title
and
its
regulatory
authority
transcend
questions
such
as
possession.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
they
are
different
actions.
however,
both
of
those
impact
the
sovereignty
of
the
state
of
california
in
that
this...
the
title
question
goes
right
to...
it's
as
if
our
treasury
was
being
invaded.
it
is
that
invasive.
to
decide
that
a
piece
of
property
does
not
belong
to
the
state--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--correct.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
first
question,
theoretically
yes,
but
again,
i
don't
see
the
practical
implication
of--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--the...
i'm
not
an
expert
in
marine
title
insurance
law.
however,
the
practical
effects
of
the
application
of
the
rule
that
we're
asking
i
think,
or
the
state
thinks
it
will
be
very
minimal.
now,
as
to
bankruptcy,
the
type
of
claim
which
is
made
in
bankruptcy
under
106
is
something
that
is
almost
reduced
to
money.
it's
a
money
debt
that
is
owed,
and
california
acknowledges
that
in
bankruptcy
if
we
do
not
file
a
proof
of
claim
under
operation
of
law
that
debt
will
be
discharged
as
to
the
state
of
california,
but
a
suit
to
quiet
title
is
an
entirely
different
matter.
it
is--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--because
an...
a
suit
to
quiet
title
is
an
adjudication
of
a
state's
right.
under
bankruptcy,
there
is
no
adjudication.
it
is
by
operation
of
law
that
the
claim
is
discharged.
it's
not
an
adjudication
that
it's
a
bad...
it's...
that
there
was
no
debt,
or
that
the
debt
exists.
it
is
just
a
simple
congressional
enactment
that
unless
you
file
a
claim
it's
discharged,
and
that
is--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--no,
no,
no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
they're
apples
and
oranges,
that
claims
to
debts
under
bankruptcy
law
is
an
apple,
and
a
quiet
title
suit
is
an
orange.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
what
i'm
saying
is...
yes,
that
the...
the
functional
equivalent
of
the
admiralty
action
is
a
direct
quiet
title
action
against
the
state.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
but
what's
the
effect
of
that
in
rem
judgment
that
deep
sea
research
owns
the
brother
jonathan?
the
effect
is
that
it
forecloses
the
state
of
california.
the
effect
is,
it's
the
same
thing
as
that
quiet
title--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--correct,
we
do,
and
as
a
practical
matter
states
are
not
going
to
sit
back.
they're
going
to
bring
actions
in
their
own
courts,
where
these
actions
belong.
i...
we
don't
see
it
as
a
crippling
interference
to
require
that
one
action
against
the
rest
of
the
world
be
in
federal
court
and
the
other
action
against
the
state
be
in
the
state
court.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
well,
they
adjudicate
the
claims
amongst
the
claimants
that
are
brought
into
federal
court,
but
the
eleventh
amendment--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--well,
the
litigant
is
going
to
have
to
come
into
state
court
against
the
state,
and
this
type
of
split
jurisdiction
is
not
uncommon.
in
the
pennhurst
case
the--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--yes,
we
do.
we
think
that
treasure
salvors,
at
least
eight
justices
there
were
quite
specific
that
what
the
court
of
appeal
did
in
actually
adjudicating
the
merits
of
the
state's
claim
to
those
artifacts
was
prevented
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
no,
the...
as
to
the
state
of
florida
it
should
have
been
dismissed.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
which
it
was
not.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
it
is,
but
we
believe
that
the
bright
case,
which
purports
to
say
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
not
apply
to
in
rem
actions,
has
very
little
authority
left
after
the
new
york
number
ii
case,
and
after
treasure
salvors,
which--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--no,
it
was
not.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
i
believe--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--that
may
have
been
what
justice
washington
was
purporting
to
hold,
but
again,
i
think
the
recent
jurisdiction
of
this
court
gets...
has
gotten
away
from
the
type
of
formalistic,
what
pigeon
hole
does
the
action
fit
into,
and
looks
at
the
effect
of
the
judgment
on
the
state.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
that's
true,
but
in
the--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--in
the
plurality
decision
in
welch
and
also
in--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--yes,
but
the
court
in
both
welch
and
in
the
treasure
salvors
case
cites
the
new
york
number
ii
for
the
broad
concept
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
apply
in
in
rem
actions.
it
has
not
been
limited
to
the
specific
holding
in
the
cases
many,
as
mr.
frederick--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--this
wreck
has
been
abandoned
because
under
general
maritime
law
as
it's
developed
in
this
country
abandonment
can
be
shown
through
the
passage
of
time
and
the
failure
to
salvage
on
the
part
of
the
owner.
in
this
case,
we
have
a
claimant
who
has
alleged
claim
to
one-sixth
of
the
cargo,
five-sixths
of
the
cargo
and
the
vessel
itself
having
clearly
been
abandoned.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
under
general
maritime
law,
there...
as
it's
developed
there
must
be
objective
steps
taken
by
the
owner
of
that
ship
to
try
and
salvage
it.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
even
if
it's
not
salvageable.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
the
cases
that
we
cite
in--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--yes.
that
is
the
way
the
it
has
developed.
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
it's
a
unique
aspect
of
abandonment
law
because
in
that
case--
mr.
joseph
c.
rusconi
--in
that
case
a
salvager
could
come
in
and
take
that
property
and
be
entitled
to
a
salvage
award
up
to
and
including
the
full
value
of
the
vessel,
and
so
it's
possible
under
circum...
i'm
not
saying
it's
likely
in
that
case,
but
it's
possible
under
the
circumstances
that
by
the
nonaction
or
the
disappearance
of
the
owner
of
the
vessel
that
you're
talking
about
it
could
be
abandoned.
