mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
the
courts
below
misconstrued
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act,
we
disagree
with
them
that
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
because
this
is
not
a
suit
against
the
state.
the
state
was
not
a
named
party,
and
the
coercive
process
of
the
federal
court
is
not
necessary
to
dispossess
state
agents
of
property.
the
filing
of
a
claim
by
a
state
in
an
admiralty
in
rem
action
does
not
transform
that
into
a
suit
commenced
or
prosecuted
against
the
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
just
like
in
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
if
a
state
is
a
creditor
the
filing
of
a
claim
by
the
state
does
not
transform
a
bankruptcy
action
into
a
suit
proscribed
by
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
this
one?
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
the
asa--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
what
happens
is
in
this
case
the
process,
the
admiralty
process
brought
this
case,
this
vessel
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
at
that
point,
when
the
court
exercises
in
rem
jurisdiction
it
has
to
decide
among
the
competing
claimants
who
owns
what.
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act
says
that
if
the
statutory
requisites
are
met,
the
united
states
assumes
title
and
transfers
it
to
the
state,
and
at
that
point
the
asa
divests
the
federal
court
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
with
respect
to
that
property
that
falls
within
the
requisites
of
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act.
so
at
the
initiation
of
the
proceeding
the
court
has
admiralty
jurisdiction,
but
if
it
is
found
that
the
asa
applies
to
a
part
of
the
wreck,
or
maybe
the
whole
wreck,
at
that
point
the
court
no
longer
has
admiralty
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that
becomes
a
much
more
difficult
proposition,
justice
kennedy,
because
what
happens
in
practical
effect
is
that
once
the
state
owns
it
by
operation
of
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act
there
are
other
consequences
that
might
flow
from
admiralty
courts'
orders,
and
it
might
be
appropriate
at
that
point
for
the
state
to
say
that
the
perpetuation
and
continuation
of
the
suit
is
in
effect
an
action
against
the
state.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
this
court's
precedents
historically
with
respect
to
foreign
sovereigns,
states,
and
the
united
states
make
clear
that
the
immunity
of
the
sovereign
turns
on
whether
its
agents
are
in
actual
possession
or
custody
of
the
property
that's
being
adjudicated,
and
there
were
several
practical
reasons
for
that.
the
first
was
that
courts
recognized
that
they
could
not
issue
coercive
process
against
a
sovereign's
agents
to
dispossess
those
agents
and
create
a
conflict
between
the
court
and
the
sovereign's
agents.
there
was
also
the
practical
reality
that
if
the
property
wasn't
in
the
possession
of
the
sovereign's
agents
it
likely
was
not
doing
the
sovereign's
work,
and
so
there
was
a
recognition
that,
as
chief
justice
waite
stated
while
riding
on
circuit,
that
the
mere
fact
that
a
sovereign
claims
title
to
property
doesn't
make
the
property
part
of
the
sovereignty.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
no,
it
does
not.
they
still
have
to
have
state
agents
who
go
on
to
the
site
and
take
possession,
and
it
would
depend
upon
the
court's
adjudication
of
that,
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
that
is
the
case.
what
the
court
did
in
this
case
was--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--respondent's
counsel
is
better
positioned
to
know
what
its
officials
and
representatives
are
doing
than
i
am,
but
what
the
district
court
did
here,
justice
o'connor,
was
to
draw
a
circle
basically
and
to
say
that
the
shipwreck
is
somewhere
within
that
circle,
and
allow
the
salvage
to
proceed.
before
turning
to
abandonment
i
do
want
to
address
just
one
point,
and
that's
the
sovereignty
interests
of
the
state
here
in
terms
of
regulatory
authority.
the
state
did
not
appeal
the
district
court's
order
with
respect
to
an
infringement
upon
its
regulatory
authority
over
salvage,
so
that
question
is
not
properly
presented
in
the
questions
upon
which
this
court
granted
certiorari.
moreover,
it's
clear
here
that
federal
interests
might
supplant
state
sovereignty
interests
if
shipwrecks
are
in
certain
places.
there
was...
is
an
express
preservation
of
rights
in
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act
so
that
if
the
brother
jonathan
had
sunk
below
the
current
site
of
the
golden
gate
bridge,
for
instance,
and
the
army
corps
of
engineers
needed
to
clear
it
out
for
navigation
and
national
defense
purposes,
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
united
states
could
do
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
ginsburg,
when
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case
we
carefully
examined
the
requisites
of
immunity
and
when
immunity
is
appropriate
in
in
rem
actions,
and
the
courts
since
the
treasure
salvors
case
have
been
in
confusion
over
whether
or
not
a
colorable
claim
needs
to
be
asserted.
we
concluded
that
that
is
not
a
helpful
way
of
analyzing
an
immunity
question
when
the
sovereign
is
not
in
actual
possession
of
the
property,
because
this
court's
cases
uniformly
say
that
when
the
sovereign
is
not
in
possession
the
colorable
claim
analysis
is
really
out
of
the
equation.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
what
we're
saying
is
that
treasure
salvors
is
what
treasure
salvors
is.
the
state
agents
had
possession
of
property
there.
they
do
not
here,
and
it
is
a
much
simpler
case
when
state
agents
do
not
have
possession
of
property
that
is
subject
to
the
in
rem
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes,
and
i...
may
i--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--yes,
i
would
like
to
address
abandonment,
justice
scalia.
i
think
technology
here
has
been
used
by
the
courts
below
to
displace
the
inferences
that
might
naturally
be
drawn
by
the
passage
of
time.
it
would
be
logical
to
infer
that
someone
who
did
not
have
the
technological
capability
to
recapture
property
has
in
fact
abandoned--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
if
you
waited
130
years
without
attempting--
[laughter]
--to
get
your
silver
dollar,
it
might
be
appropriate
to
infer
that
you
have
abandoned
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
in
this
case
respondents
don't
even
know
that
it
was
a
silver
dollar
that
they
lost.
they
purchased
something
from
insurance
companies
who
have
no
records
of
what
property
they
insured
aboard
the
shipwreck,
so
to
use
your
analogy,
they're
searching
for
something
in
the
grate,
but
they
don't
know
what
it
is.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
no.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
you
have
to
know
what
property
you
own
before
you
can
know
whether
or
not
you
did
not
abandon
it.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
justice
breyer,
i
can't
give
you
a
firm
time.
it's
all
based
on
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
no,
you--
