chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1400,
california
and
state
lands
commission
v.
the
deep
sea
research,
inc.--
mr.
rusconi.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
rusconi,
your
opponents
cite
the
old
peters
case
from
this
court
as
standing
for
the
proposition
that
a
federal
court
can
adjudicate
an
action
so
long
as
the
property
is
not
in
the
possession
of
the
state.
now,
do
you
disagree
with
that
reading
of
peters?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we're
talking
here
about
an
in
rem
action
in
admiralty
which
i
think
has
long
had
special
characteristics
that
might
not
carry
over
to
bankruptcy
or
to
a
quiet
title
action.
are
you
agreeing
that
the...
whatever
rule
we
devise
or
apply
in
this
particular
case
would
carry
over
totally
unchanged
into
bankruptcy
under
quiet
title
actions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
are
you
equating
a
quiet
title
action
with
this
sort
of
in
rem
action
in
admiralty?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
difference,
traditionally,
is
that
the
in
rem
action
adjudicates
title
against
the
world.
in
a
quiet
title
action,
you
have
to
join
all
the
possible
defendants,
and
then
you
get
a
quiet
title
action
only
as
to
them,
unless
you're
dealing
with
some...
the
massachusetts
title
system,
which
doesn't
prevail
in
most
places.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
intervene
in
the
case
if
you
want
to.
i
mean,
it's
not
as
if
you're
prevented
from
making
california's
claim.
all
that
you're
prevented
from
doing
is
saying...
is
sitting
back
and
saying
you've
adjudicated
title
against
all
the
rest
of
the
world
but
not
against
us,
and
you
say
the
eleventh
amendment
entitles
you
to
do
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
new
york,
both
of
those
cases
were...
they
did
repudiate
formalism,
and
they
said
that
in
those
cases
it
was
basically
an
in
personam
action
against
the
state,
so
i
don't
think
that
supports
your
theory
here,
because
this
court
did
not
treat
them
as
in
rem
actions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
why
do
you
cite
them
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i'm
talking
to
you
about
the
two
ex
parte
new
york
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rusconi.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
frederick,
do
you
agree
that
if
the...
if
this
property
were
in
the
possession
of
the
state
that
the
eleventh
amendment
would
prevent
an
in
rem
adjudication
of
title?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
does
the
possession
rule
mean,
strictly
speaking?
supposing
there's
a
state
marina
with
state
water
police
boats
in
it,
and
there's
an
admiralty
action
brought
against...
to
adjudicate
title
in
one
of
those
boats,
but
actually
it
isn't
owned
by
the
state,
but
it's
in
this
state-owned
marina.
now,
would
that
be
in
the
possession
of
the
state,
or
does
it
have
to
be
actually
owned
by
the
state?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
that's
exactly
contrary
to
the--
[laughter]
if
you
say
that
the
objective
manifestations
are
useful
only
as
a
basis
from
which
one
can
infer
subjective
intent,
you're
saying
that
the
basic
criterion
remains
subjective
intent.
now,
in
the
light
of
justice
scalia's
withering
example
do
you
still--
do
you
still
adhere
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
here,
whose
intent
do
we
look
for?
is
it
the
chief
executive
officer
of
the
various
insurance
companies
in
the
year
1868,
or
whenever
it
was
that
the
brother
jonathan
went
down?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
present
claimants
claim
only
by
virtue
of
an
assignment
from
the
insurance
company,
don't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
don't
your
clients,
or
at
least
some
of
them,
claim
by
virtue
of
assignment
from
the
insurance
company?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--let's
analyze
the
claim
that
you
get
by
assignment
from
the
insurance
company.
is
it
the
intent
of
some
person
or
persons
at
the
insurance
company
in
1868
that
we
look
for?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
how
do
we
find
that
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now
we're
talking
about
objective
factors.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
the
subjective
intent
we're
looking
for
is
the,
"the
intent
of
the
company
as
a
whole?
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
almost
a
default
type
of
thing
rather
than
abandonment,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
default
of
judicial
proceedings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
no.
i'm
suggesting
that
you
can
have
a
concept
of
default
in
a
judicial
proceeding,
failure
to
appear
and
assert
a
claim,
that
may
have
nothing
to
do
with
historical
abandonment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
alford.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
