justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
i
might
agree
with
that,
and
then
suggest
that
perhaps
the
eleventh
amendment
doesn't
apply
at
all
to
an
in
rem
action
where
the
res
is
not
in
the
custody,
the
actual
custody
of
the
state.
if
you
don't
accept
justice
souter's
lifeline
it
seems
to
me
that
this
shows
that
perhaps
the
in...
the
utility
of
in
rem
actions
is
substantially
destroyed
by
your
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
in
the...
the
bright
is
very
much
like
this
case,
is
it
not,
in
that
what
we
are
dealing
with
is
a
res
that
was
not
in
the
possession
of
the
government,
or
is
that
incorrect,
or
of
the
state?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
see,
in
new
york
i
and
ii
you
could
plausibly
make
the
argument
that
this
was
a
disguised
or
ineffective
damages
remedy
against
the
state,
but
this
was
the
case
that
justice
story
relied
on
in
his
commentaries.
i'm
not
sure
if
it
was
decided
subsequently
by
our
court
as
authoritative.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
it
does
indicate
the
practice
at
the
time
was
to
recognize
that
admiralty
in
rem
proceedings
ought
to
be
able
to
proceed
efficiently,
and
that
is
to
bind
all
of
the
probable
claimants.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
was
this
a
case
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
court?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
the
asa
does
not
change
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
cases
under
the
asa
are
within
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--does
that
mean
the
eleventh
amendment
objection
of
the
state
then
becomes
active,
whereas...
and
a
problem,
whereas
before
we
could
have
displaced
it
by
saying
that
historically
in
rem
admiralty
jurisdiction
is
sufficient
to
bind
the
state,
but
once
we're
in...
within
the
federal
question
jurisdiction
the
state
then
makes
the
argument
that
the
eleventh
amendment
sort
of
springs
back
into
play?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
except
you
know
you've
lost
something.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
rule,
i...
if
there
has
to
be
some
voluntary
act
relinquishing
all
claim
of
title,
i
suppose
that
no
one
would
ever
do
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you'd
teach
a
child
when
you're
3
years
old,
don't
ever
abandon
that
dollar
in
the
steam
grate,
because
some
day
it
might
be
yours.
i'm
not
sure
the
law
requires
that.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
far
as
the
standard
is
concerned,
are
you...
are
we
trying
to
find
a
subjective
state
of
mind,
or
are
we
trying
to
determine
what
objectively
is
reasonable
so
far
as
ownership
of
ancient
property?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
subjective,
i'm
never
sure...
i'm
not
sure
you're
ever
going
to
be
able
to
show
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
we
can
almost
take
judicial
notice
that
no
one,
especially
an
insurance
company,
ever
wants
to
give
up
claim
of
ownership
to
anything
it
might
have.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
consistent
with
what
i
take
it
to
be
your
answer
to
justice
stevens.
i
just
infer
this,
that
if
the
spanish
government
had
come
forward
that
would
have
been
sufficient,
even
though
they
had
done
nothing
for
500
years.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
that
seems
to
me
a
very
extraordinary
position.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
it's
your
point
that
the
spanish
are
not
foreclosed
unless
it
has
been
shown
that
they
affirmatively
took
some
act
to
abandon?
