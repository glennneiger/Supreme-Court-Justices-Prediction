isn't
that
practically
the
end
of
such
actions,
because
let's
take
this
case.
you
say
california
is
out,
but
the
admiralty
court
can
adjudicate
everything
else.
well,
what
else?
there's
a
claim
by
the
united
states,
and
there's
a
claim
by
the
salvors,
but
how
could
this
federal
district
court
adjudicate
finally
even
those
claims,
because
the
state
is...
won't
be
bound
by
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
kind
of
litigant
would
be
satisfied
with
the
judgment
that
has
a
big
player
looming
out
there
saying,
whatever
this
district
court
does,
it
won't
touch
us
and
we
can
reargue
the
whole
thing?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
frederick,
i'm
just
curious
about
where
the
government
saw
the
light,
because
you
made
a
rather
strong
argument
in
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
eleventh
amendment
does
apply,
and
that...
and
now
you've
switched
positions
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
say
treasure
salvors
was
wrong?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
that's
the
line
that
you
draw...
for
example,
the
united
states.
the
united
states
didn't
do
anything
to
get
the
gold.
all
it
did
was,
when
it
found
out
it
was
there,
it
filed
a
claim.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
suppose
that's
the
case.
suppose
the
united
states
was
just
sitting
there
doing
nothing
about
this,
thinking
that
ship
would
never
be
found,
but
the
moment
it
was
found,
put
in
a
claim,
would
you
say
that
the
united
states,
because
it
had
done
absolutely
nothing,
is
not
claiming
that
it's
done
anything...
it
abandoned
it
because
it
didn't
step
forward
until
someone
else
found
the
vessel,
and
then
it
said,
we
have
stuff
on
it.
