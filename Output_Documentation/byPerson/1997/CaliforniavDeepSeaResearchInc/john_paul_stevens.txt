justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you
with
just
one
question
there?
i
understand
the
ninth
circuit...
because
they
wrote
the
opinion,
but
is
it
not
correct
that
the
issues
of
title
and
regulatory
authority
really
are
quite
different,
that
it
might
well
be
true
that
the
in
rem
action
would
bind
you
as
to
title,
but
not
necessarily
as
to
regulatory
control?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
all
i'm
saying
is,
is
it
not...
would
you
not
agree
that
you
might
lose
on
the
title
argument
and
still
win
on
the
regulatory
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
your
position
is
entirely
consistent
with
our
treasure
salvors
decision?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
shouldn't...
under
your
view
shouldn't
the
action
have
been
dismissed?
under
your
view,
should
not
the
action
have
not
survived
in
federal
court
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
which
it
was
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
we
asked
you
about
some
of
the
old
cases.
justice
washington's
case
on
circuit,
the
bright,
is
really
a
very
strong
position
for
your
opponents,
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
can
i
just
vary
the
chief
justice's
question
a
little?
it
seems
to
me
that
under
your
rule
it
would
be
wise,
if
states
want
to
get
control
of
these
abandoned
vessels,
or
sunken
vessels,
as
soon
as
they
hear
about
it,
send
the
local
police
out
in
the
appropriate
vessels
and
just
take
possession,
and
then
let
the
litigation
go
forward.
doesn't
this...
doesn't
your
rule
encourage
states
to
use
self
help
in
these
situations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
it
in
your
adverse
possession
all
the
time
in
real
estate.
if
somebody
else
gets
on
your
land
and
stays
there
whatever
the
period
of
time
is,
you've
lost
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
under
your
view
of
abandonment,
was
the
gold
in
the
hull
of
the
ship
that
was
involved
in
the
treasure
salvors
case
abandoned
by
the
spanish?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there's
no
evidence
of
affirmative,
you
know,
voluntary
relinquishment
of
interest
in
all
that
money.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
give
them
to
you,
then.
a
ship
is
found
that
went
down
in
14
or
1500,
somewhere
back...
loaded
with
gold
that
everybody
knew
belonged
to
spain
at
the
time
the
ship
went
down.
was
it
abandoned,
or
not?
that's
all
you
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
abandonment
took
place
after
the
finding
of
the
vessel,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
don't...
the
word
finding
was
bad.
the
time
the
abandonment
occurred
was
after
the
discovery
of
the
vessel.
is
that
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
precisely
the
same
situation
we
have
here,
except
instead
of
spanish
gold
it's
american
dollars.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
or,
i
guess,
two
parts
to
this.
one,
is
it
perfectly
clear
that
the
term
abandoned
in
this
statute
has
the
same
meaning
it
had
at
admiralty
law
before
the
statute
was
enacted?
that's
my
first
question.
my
second
question
is,
is
it
not
likely
that
congress
assumed
that
this
statute
would
apply
to
a
lot
of
sunken
vessels,
and
if
we
adopt
your
view
of
abandonment,
it
won't
apply
to
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
is
evidence
that
they
thought
the
statute
would
apply
to
a
large
number
of
vessels.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
don't
think,
under
your
view,
it
would
apply
to
any.
