mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
this
case
is
properly
before
the
admiralty
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
indeed,
the
federal
admiralty
court
is
the
only
court
where
such
an
action
could
have
been
brought.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that
admiralty
in
rem
actions
against
shipwrecked
vessels
are
uniquely
and
exclusively
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
courts,
and
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
sovereign,
simply
by
asserting
the
claim
of
ownership
to
the
res
in
the
possession
of
the
court
divests
the
court
of
its
constitutionally
mandated
exclusive
jurisdiction.
rather,
this...
a
long
line
of
this
court's
jurisprudence
stands
for
the
proposition
that
only
where
the
property
is
within
the
actual
physical
possession
of
the
sovereign
is
the
action
at
that
point
deemed
to
be
an
action
against
the
sovereign
itself.
where
the
property
is
not
in
the
actual
possession
of
the
sovereign,
the
rule
is
that
the
case
may
go
forward
and
the
sovereign,
if
it
wishes
to
do
so,
may
enter
into
the
suit
and
assert
a
claim
and
prove
that
claim
just
like
any
other
claimant
in
the
world.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
that
is
consistent
with
this
court's
cases,
and
i
certainly
don't
think
it's
necessary
to
decide
this
case.
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
decide
this
case
on
a
narrower
rule
that--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--a
possession
rule,
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
the
possession
rule
has
been
applied
not
only
to
states
but
also
to
foreign
sovereigns
and
to
the
federal
government
and,
you
know,
the
question
is,
why
should
any
different
rule
apply
to
the
states?
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
i
don't
think
possession
and
ownership
necessarily
have
to
be
equated,
your
honor.
i
think,
if
i
understand
your
honor's
hypothetical
correctly,
this
is
a
situation
where
a
slip
in
a
state-owned
marina
is
leased
to
a
private
party.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
then
certainly
in
that
case
the
private
party
would
be
deemed
to
be
the
one
in
possession
of
the
boat
that
is
in
the
slip
that
it
has
leased
from
the
government,
but--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--well,
your
honor,
no,
i
don't
think
so.
i
think
our
rule
encourages
states
to
locate
these
wrecks
if
they
want
to
exercise
control
over
them,
and
i
think
that's
certainly
the
purpose
of
the
abandoned
shipwreck
also,
which
was
to
encourage
states
to
locate
these
wrecks
and,
indeed,
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act
requires
states
to
give
public
notice
of
the
location
of
wrecks
to
which
it
claims
title
under
the
asa,
so
i
think
this
encourages
states,
if
they
really
want
to
exercise
dominion
over
these
wrecks,
to
at
least
locate
them.
that's
a
fundamental
threshold
issue,
and--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
so.
in
the
navemar,
for
instance,
in
a
foreign
sovereign
immunities
context,
this
court
defined
actual
possession
as
some
act
of
physical
dominion
or
control,
so
at
a
threshold,
certainly
the
state
would
need
to
know
where
the
wreck
is
located.
i
mean,
it's
absurd
to
say
that
the
state
has
possession
of
something
and
it
doesn't
even
know
where
it's
at,
it
can't
find
it,
so
that
has
to
be
a
threshold
issue.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor,
there
has
to
be
some
act
of
physical
dominion
and
control.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
your
honor,
i
do
think
that
would
be
sufficient.
if
the
state
knew
where
the
wreck
was
located
and
marked
it
as
state
property,
i
think
that
would
be
sufficient,
but
that
is...
it's
undisputed
that
that
has
not
happened
here.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
no,
your
honor.
i
think--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--they
absolutely
are,
your
honor,
but
taking
physical...
some
act
that
shows
physical
dominion
over
the
property
i
think
is
possession.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor,
traditionally
that's
the
way
that
it's
indicated
in
the
admiralty
law
with
the
case
of
sunken
property.
for
instance,
a
salvor,
when
it
locates
a
shipwreck,
often
posts
a
buoy
on
the
site
and,
in
the
traditional
federal
admiralty
law,
when
the
court
arrests
sunken
property
it
often
puts
a
buoy
on
the
site
with
the
arrest
papers
on
the
buoy,
so
i
think
by
analogy,
if
the
state
were
to
locate
the
wreck
and
mark
the
wreck
with
its
sign
in
some
way,
then
i
think
that
would
be
possession.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
yes,
your
honor.
the
state
and
the
federal
government
suggest
that
there's
some
dispute
or
uncertainty
about
the
definition
of
abandonment.
i
disagree.
i
think
abandonment
is
a
fundamental,
well-known
concept
in
the
common
law.
as
justice
scalia
noted,
it
has
to
be
some
type
of
voluntary
relinquishment
of
ownership
to
property.
if
it's
not
a
voluntary
relinquishment,
then
it's
a
taking,
so
there
has
to
be
some
indication
of
a
voluntary
relinquishment
of
title.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
i
agree
certainly,
your
honor,
that
abandonment
can
be
inferred
from
the
circumstances.
i
do
not
agree
that
simply
the
passage
of
time
without
any
kind
of
notice
would
be
sufficient.
i
think
that
would
be
a
due
process
problem.
i
think
it
would
also
be
a
takings
problem.
for
instance,
in
this
case--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--that's
true,
your
honor,
but
it's
my
understanding
in
those
cases
that
the
possession
has
to
be
open
and
notorious,
such
that
it
would
give
any
claimant
notice
that
another
person
is
occupying
the
property,
and
that's
certainly
not
the
case
here.
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
distinction--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--you
certainly
know
you've
lost
something,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--i
agree
with
your
honor.
i
do
not
think
the
law
requires
any
kind
of
explicit
act,
and
i
think
the
lower
courts
did
not
interpret
the
law
in
that
manner,
but
in
any
event,
it
requires
some
evidence
of
a
voluntary
relinquishment
of
ownership.
it
doesn't
require
an
explicit
statement,
but
some
evidence
of
intent
on
the
part
of
the
original
owner
to
relinquish
ownership.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor,
there
has
to
be
some
evidence
that
there
is
a
relinquishment
of
ownership
or,
on
the
converse,
there
has
to
be
some
evidence.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor,
the
problem
is
we
don't
know
whether
that's
this
case.
we
simply
don't
know,
and--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it's
part
of
both.
i
think
there
has
to
be
some
subjective
intent
to
relinquish
ownership,
but
it
certainly
can
be
proven
by
objective
factors.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
i
think
you
can,
your
honor.
i
think
it
would
be
appropriate
in
certain
circumstances
to
infer
from
all
the
facts
that
the
original
owner
had
an
intent
to
abandon
the
property.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
fundamental
issue
is,
is
the
owner's
intent,
but
certainly
the
court
can
look
to
objective
factors
and--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
that's
right.
i
think
it's
the
objective
manifestations
of
a
subjective
intent.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
if
i
understand
your
honor's
question
correctly,
yes,
i
think
it
is...
ultimately
that
subjective
intent
is
the
key
issue,
but
it
can
be
proven
by
objective
factors.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
i
think
it's
that,
your
honor,
but
it's
also
more.
it's
the
present
claimants,
and
i
think
that's
one
of
the
problems
here.
at
this
early
stage
in
the
litigation
i
submit
that
the
district
court
had
no
choice
but
to--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--no.
there
are
other
claims
as
well,
your
honor.
for
instance,
the
united
states
claims
that
it
had
original
title
to
the
property.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
also
have
a
salvage
claim
which
is
not
an
ownership
claim--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--but
it's
a
claim
based
on
federal
law.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
i
think
it's
the
intent
of
the
company
as
a
whole,
your
honor,
and
i
think--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--factors
that
the
court
can
consider...
well,
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
constrain
the
district
court's
discretion
in
this
regard,
but,
for
example,
factors
the
district
court
might
consider
are
whether
the
insurance
company's
ever
made
any
effort
to
locate
the
vessel--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--that's
right.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
as
evidenced
by
objective
factors,
and
i
think
the
objective
factors
in
this
case,
for
instance,
could
include
whether
the
company
ever
made
any
effort
to
locate
the
vessel,
whether
they...
whether
it
was
technologically
feasible
for
them
to
locate
the
vessel,
whether
they
wrote
it
off
as
a
loss
on
their
books--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--well,
your
honor,
i
assume
that's
true,
but
again
i
think
there's
a
fundamental
distinction
here
between
property
that's
lost
and
property
that
is
abandoned,
and
property
that's
lost
is
not
necessarily
abandoned.
there's
no
doubt
this
wreck
was
lost
to
the
original
owners,
but
the
question
is,
has
it
been
abandoned
by
them,
and
i
think
justice--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
was
indicated
in
one
newspaper
article,
but
that's
another
problem.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
your
honor,
i
think
it
has
to
be
treated
as
a
whole,
particularly
under
the
asa.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
your
honor,
under
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act,
section
2102(e),
i
believe,
of
the
act,
it
defines
a
shipwreck
as
"a
vessel
or
wreck,
its
cargo
and
other
contents.
"
a
single,
unified
entity.
it
doesn't
parse
the
wreck
up
into
separate
pieces.
it
says
that
a
shipwreck
is
a
single
thing.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
your
honor,
i
think--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--well,
there
is,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--because
if
the
court
finds
that
because
part
of
the
property
was
abandoned
the
entire
property
is
abandoned,
then
you
certainly
have
a
takings
problem,
particularly
in
a
context
like
this,
where
no
notice
was
given
to
particular
claimants.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
that's
why
it
was
essential
for
the
district
court
to
find
at
this
stage
that
the
wreck
was
not
abandoned,
because
there
was
no
notice
to
potential
claimants.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
district
court
found
that
it
was
convinced
the
wreck
was
not
abandoned,
but
it
was
not
prepared
to
say
that
specific
items
of
property
either
were
or
were
not
abandoned,
because
again
the
court
stressed
that
notice
had
not
been
given
to
potential
claimants,
and
that
once
notice
had
been
given
to
the
world
by
publication,
claimants
might
continue
to
come
forward.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
i
don't
think
the
ninth
circuit
did,
your
honor.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
simply
affirmed
the
district
court's
finding
that
at
that
stage
of
the
litigation
the
district
court
could
not
say
that
the
wreck
was
abandoned
because
no
notice
had
been
given
to
any
potential
claimants.
and
in
fact
the
district
court's
judgment
in
this
regard
has
been
validated,
because
potential
claimants
have
continued
to
come
forward
since
publication
of
the
notice,
and
it
would
have
been
entirely
premature
at
that
stage
of
the
litigation
for
the
district
court
to
say
that
the
property
was
abandoned
and
therefore
cut
off
all
potential
claimants.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
your
honor,
i--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--right.
i
don't
completely
know
the
facts
of
that
case,
but
as
i--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--i
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
it's
my
understanding
the
government
did
not
come
forward
after
notice
in
that
case.
in
other
words--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--well,
the
finding
of
abandonment
was
appropriate
once
the
court
issued
notice
to
the
public
and
no
claimants
came
forward.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
the
critical
difference,
your
honor,
is
that
in
treasure
salvors
notice
was
given
to
the
public
and
no
one
came
forward
claiming
ownership.
that
is
perhaps--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--well,
your
honor--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--that's
true,
your
honor.
i
think
that
abandonment
could
be
found
by
default
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
think
the
issues
are
related
in
at
least
one
respect
and
that
is,
in
a
sense,
if
notice
was
given
to
the
public
and
no
one
comes
forward
claiming
the
property,
that
is,
i
think,
powerful
evidence
that
the
property
is
abandoned.
it's
not
only
a
legal
default,
but
i
think
it
also
goes
to
evidence
of
intent
to
relinquish
ownership
of
the
property.
no
one's
come
forward
to
claim
it.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
you're
right
in
that
worry.
again,
claimants
have
to
come
forward
and
prove
their
claims.
it's
not
enough
for
them
to
come
forward
and
say,
i
understand
that
property
is
never
abandoned,
therefore
i
own
a
piece
of
it.
they
would
be
required
to
prove
that
they--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
the
passage
of
time
in
itself,
without
anything
more,
is
not
sufficient
to
infer
abandonment
where
claimants
actually
come
forward.
the
loss
should
not
start
with
a
presumption
that
the
property
is
abandoned.
california
speaks
in
its
brief
about
a
presumption
of
abandonment.
there's
absolutely
no
authority
for
that
position.
i
think
that
if
claimants
come
forward
they
ought
to
be
allowed
to
prove
their
claim,
and--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
no,
your
honor.
the
fact
that
they
simply
come
forward
is
not
enough
in
itself
to
prove
not
abandoned...
nonabandonment.
my
point,
however,
inartfully
made,
perhaps,
was
that
before
we
even
give
notice--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--no,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
abandonment
needs
to
be
proven
by
some
affirmative
act.
it
can
be
proven
by
inference
from
the
circumstances,
and
that
was
certainly
recognized
by
the
lower
courts
here.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
that's
exactly
correct,
your
honor,
because
of
the
operation
of
the
abandoned
shipwreck
act.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor,
on
the
first
question,
i
think
we
have
to
start
from
the
presumption
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
change
the
fundamental
concept
of
abandonment
that
has
been
applied
for
years
both
in
the
common
law
and
in
the
general
maritime
law,
and
indeed
that
congress
is
not
free
to
define
abandonment
in
some
way
other
than
as
a
voluntary
process,
and
there's
no
evidence,
certainly,
in
the
legislative
record
that
congress
intended
to
depart
from
the
traditional
standard
of
abandonment.
certainly--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
i
respectfully
disagree,
your
honor.
again,
if
no
claimants
come
forward,
then
certainly
the
court
would
be
justified
in
finding,
both
as
a
matter
of
default
and
as
a
matter
of
evidence,
that
the
property
is
abandoned.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
we
don't
know
yet,
your
honor,
and
that's
the
problem.
that's
the
essential
feature
here.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
your
honor,
an
inference
of
abandonment
might
well
be
appropriate
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
that's
true.
the
united
states
says
that
it
has--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--that's
right,
but
barring
that,
that
complication,
i
think
an
inference
of
abandonment
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
that's
correct,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--no,
to
the
contrary,
your
honor,
the
united
states
claim
is
preserved.
they
have
a
claim
here,
and
they
are
certainly
capable
of
proving
that.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
well,
your
honor.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
it's
all
or
nothing
if
one--
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
--your
honor,
i
partly
agree
with
that,
and
i
say
partly
because
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
this
court
to
say
that
because
part
of
the
property
on
the
wreck
is
abandoned
the
whole
thing
is
abandoned.
that
would
constitute
a
relinquishment
of
the
rights
of
the
owners.
mr.
fletcher
c.
alford
thank
you.
