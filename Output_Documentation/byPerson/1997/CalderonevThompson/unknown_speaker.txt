unknown
speaker
ms.
wilkens,
what
are
the
limits
on
a
court
of
appeals'
power
and
authority
to
recall
a
mandate
sua
sponte?
do
we
know?
i
mean,
what
cases
do
we
look
to
to
determine
that?
unknown
speaker
even
after
a
judgment
has
become
final?
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
we
look
to
in
the
case
of
a
habeas
proceeding,
which
we've
said
is
a
civil
action?
what
do
we
look
to
there?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that
the
new
federal
antiterrorism
and
death
penalty
act
speaks
to
the
question
of
what
a
court
of
appeals
can
do
concerning
recalling
its
own
mandate?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
talks
about
a
second
or
successive
habeas
corpus
application.
here,
the
ninth
circuit
was
quite
explicit
about
saying
that
it
was
resting
just
on
the
previous
application.
it
added
no
new
facts.
suppose
the
three
judge
panel
issues
a
mandate
in
a
habeas
corpus
action
and
the
very
next
day
recalls
its
mandate
because
it
made
a
mistake.
is
this
a
successive
application?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
finality,
as
i
understand
your
answer
to
an
earlier
question,
there
isn't
a
finality
issue
under
the
general
rule
for
civil
cases,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
why
is
there
a
finality
rule
here,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
a
finality
rule
here
when
the
action
is
taken,
as
we
will
assume
that
it
was,
on
the
court's
own
motion?
the
new
statute
certainly
limits
what
may
be
done
in
response
to
a
petition
or
a
request
by
the
habeas
petitioner,
but
how
do
those
provisions
enact
a,
as
it
were,
a
finality
rule
to
govern
this
class
of
civil
cases
when
there
is
generally
no
finality
rule
and
the
action
is
taken
by
the
court
on
its
own
motion?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
a
different
argument.
if
you
want
to
say
that
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion
here
i
think
that's
quite
a
substantial
argument,
but
you're
talking
about
first
the
fact
that
it's
a
successive
petition
barred
by
the
act,
and
it
just
seems
to
me
that
that's
a
very,
very
rigorous
reading
of
the
act,
that
once
the
mandate
issues
you
can't
correct
it
even
if
there's
no
abuse
of
discretion.
your
opening
argument
is
that
this
is
a
violation
of
the
new
act.
unknown
speaker
and
if
you
want
to
spend
your
time
on
that,
fine.
but
it
seems
to
me
it's
abuse
of
the
writ
is
the
more
substantial
claim.
unknown
speaker
let
me
go
back
a
moment
to
the
questions
i
believe
justice
o'connor
asked
about
the
general
standard
for
reviewing,
recalling
a
mandate,
or
for
a
court,
an
appellate
court...
are
any
of
those
federal
cases,
did
the
recall
of
the
mandate
occur
after
this
court
had
denied
certiorari?
unknown
speaker
and
are
they
in
the
brief?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
what
aedpa
has
to
do
with
this.
i
mean,
i
thought
the
ninth
circuit
specifically
says
at
the
beginning
we're
not
taking
this
en
banc
because
of
any
new
evidence,
because
of
anything
thompson
did,
because
of
any
second
or
successive
claim
for
relief.
we're
simply
doing
what
we
normally
do,
which
is
to
review
a
panel
en
banc
if
a
majority
want.
the
only
unusual
aspect
of
this
is
the
fact
that
they
issued
this
sua
sponte,
isn't
it?
they
issued
this
sua
sponte,
this
recall
of
the
mandate,
so
we
have
an
ordinary
recall
of
a
mandate
case.
i
mean,
maybe
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
maybe
it
isn't,
but
i'm
simply
adding,
i'd
like
to
know
why
it's
an
abuse
of
discretion,
because
that
seems
to
me
to
be
the
issue.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you're
saying,
suppose
a
circuit
decides
in
favor
of
a
petitioner,
and
then
we
agree
to
review
it,
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
aedpa?
we're
just
reviewing
the
initial
decision,
and
why
is
it
any
different
if
a
circuit
court
en
banc
reviews
a
panel
decision?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
the
problem
is,
i
take
it,
that
what
they
did
is,
they
did
this
later,
sua
sponte.
they
recalled
the
mandate.
unknown
speaker
ms.
wilkens,
who
did
it
sua
sponte?
this
is
a
question
i
have
in
this
case.
i'm
not
sure
that
justice
breyer's
description
fits
the
panel.
the
panel,
the
en
banc
panel,
which
is
not
a
majority,
even,
of
the
entire
circuit,
decided
that
it
would
not
take
any
account
of
the
application
and
just
do
the
matter
sua
sponte,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
how
did
it
get
en
banc?
it
wasn't
the
panel
that
put
it
in
banc.
unknown
speaker
it
was
a
vote
of
the
majority
of
all
the
judges
in
active
service,
as
rule,
what
is
it,
35a
requires.
unknown
speaker
and
that
majority
of
all
the
active
judges,
what
did
they
vote
to
put
en
banc?
was
it
the
question
of
whether
they
should
sua
sponte
recall
their
mandate?
unknown
speaker
yes.
so
as
far
as
how
the
thing
got
to
this
en
banc
panel,
it
was
on
a
decision
to
respond
to
a
motion
by
the
defendant,
who
had
previously
lost
the
habeas
corpus
case.
unknown
speaker
is
that
unusual,
too,
because
isn't
it
a...
i
mean,
it
happens
sometimes
an
appellant
says
to
a
court,
we'd
like
you
to
issue
a
writ
of...
we'd
like
you
to
review
this
on
appeal,
and
you
hear
it
then
as
the
court,
and
then
the
court
says,
gee,
we
can't
decide
this
on
appeal,
but
we
have
the
power
anyway
to
issue,
say,
a
writ
of
mandamus,
so
we
do
it
for
that
reason.
unknown
speaker
is
what
they
said.
unknown
speaker
let
me
tell
you
precisely,
rather
than...
what's
bothering
me...
at
some
point
we'll
get
to
this
point.
my
problem
is,
if
you
win
on
this
issue,
on
the
issue
of
issuing
the
mandate
sua...
et
cetera,
i
worry
about
the
implications
for
courts
of
appeals,
who
very
often
are
presented
with
unusual
circumstances,
i
mean,
at
least
unusually,
and
they
normally
think
they
have
the
power
to
deal
with
an
unusual
circumstance
that
calls
for
it
by
recalling
a
writ
where
there
is
such
a
circumstance,
and
what's
worrying
about...
me
about
your
side
of
this
case
is
that
an
opinion
of
this
court
would
limit
that
power
in
other
circumstances
where
it
is
clearly
necessary.
that's
what
i'd
like
you
at
some
point
to
respond
to.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
there
an
analogy...
you
were
asked
whether
the
court
of
appeals
acted
sua
sponte.
you
asked
for
a
petition...
you
petitioned
for
mandamus,
and
we
decided
that
wasn't
the
right
way
to
go
about
it,
and
we
sua
sponte
decided
to
hear
the
case
and
grant
the
writ
of
certiorari.
do
you
think
that's
very
different
from
what
the
court
of
appeals
did?
unknown
speaker
but
then
what
are
the
restrictions
on
the
court
of
appeals?
that's
what
we're
trying
to
figure
out.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
they
didn't
issue
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus.
they
just
recalled
their
mandate.
unknown
speaker
anything
else
any
other
court
would
do
in
the
proceeding
would
be
a
petitioner
acting
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
in
effect.
unknown
speaker
if
so,
why
wasn't
our
grant
basically
looked
the
same
way?
unknown
speaker
well--
--i
suppose
that
your
position,
then,
is
not
that
there
is
going
to
be
any
overall
restriction.
you
don't
submit
there
should
be
any
overall
contraction
of
the
authority
of
a
court
of
appeals
to
recall
its
mandate,
but
that
just
in
the
light
of
the
aedpa,
perhaps,
as
we
said
in
felker,
informed
by
that,
that
it's
in
those
kind
of
cases
that
there
would
be
some
restriction.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
define
when
the
first
court
of...
habeas
corpus
proceeding
comes
to
a
close?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
they
said--
--and
what's
the
authority
you
have
for
that?
unknown
speaker
pardon
me?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
the
reason
they
said
they
waited
was
because
they
wanted
to
see
what
the
state
courts
would
do.
they
wanted
to
see
what
this
court
would
do.
that's
awfully
normal.
don't
make
a
tough
decision,
you
know,
when
you
don't
have
to
if
it's
before
another
court.
does
that
make
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
this
was
a
case
where
the
court
said,
yes,
we
slipped
up,
there
was
a
lot
of
carelessness
going
on,
but
the
one
thing
we
want
you
to
know
is,
we
are
not
entertaining
a
second
habeas.
we're
going
back
to
that
first
one,
and
it
was
the
court's
own
sloppiness
and
carelessness
that
takes
us
back
there,
and
we
think
that
when
there
is
a
grave
consequence
to
a
human
being,
we
ought
not
let
the
sloppiness
of
some
of
our
members
control.
but
you
keep
saying
that
we
have
to
bring
into
the
picture
the
new
legislation.
the
ninth
circuit
majority
was
insistent
that
they
were
back
before
the
new
legislation,
that
all
they
were
doing
was
correcting
the
mistakes
of
some
of
their
colleagues,
and
they
were
focusing
precisely
on
the
first
habeas,
nothing
after.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
wilkens,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
here
about,
suppose
we
think
that
the
new
federal
death
penalty
act
does
not
mean
that
a
circuit
court
cannot
recall
its
own
mandate.
let's
assume
we
reject
that
motion,
that
it's
open
to
the
court
to
do
it.
what
is
the
standard
for
abuse
of
discretion,
if
any,
that
would
be
applicable
in
our
examination
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
in
fact
does?
is
there
any
different
standard
that
we
apply
if
the
situation
is
one
in
which
a
case
has
become
final,
or
is
it
the
same
standard
if
it
hadn't
become
final,
and
what
is
it?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
think
that
standard
should
be
different
in
death
penalty
cases
than
in
ordinary
civil
cases,
or
in
a
criminal
case
versus...
i
mean,
a
criminal
habeas
proceeding
versus
a
normal
civil
case?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
the
standard?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
there's
just
no
authority
at
all
to
withdraw
the
mandate?
unknown
speaker
it's
very
odd
for
us
to
say,
well
now,
suppose
the
aedpa
does
not
apply,
what
is
the
standard
for
withdrawing
a
mandate,
what
is
the
standard
for...
or
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
you
say...
and
then
you
say,
aedpa.
well,
that
doesn't
seem
to
advance
the
analysis
very
much.
isn't
it
something
like
miscarriage
of
justice?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
you...
i
think
what's
bothering
all
of
us
is
that
if
you
import
the...
a
standard
out
of
the
effective
death
penalty
act,
then
you
are
acting
on
exactly
the
opposite
assumption
of
justice
o'connor's
questions
and
all
the
questions
that
have
been
asked.
that
assumption
was
that
the
new
act
limits
what
a
petitioner
can
do,
but
it
does
not
necessarily
limit
what
a
court
can
do
on
its
own
motion,
and
your
answer
saying,
well,
you
should
look
to
the
act
for
your
standard,
in
effect
says
it
limits
the
court
the
same
way
it
limits
the
petitioner,
and
we're
assuming
that
is
not
the
case,
and
i
think
there's
a
good
reason,
perhaps,
to
assume
that.
but
isn't
it
so
that,
if
you
simply
look
to
the
act,
you
are
really
saying
the
act
binds
a
court
just
as
if
a
court
were
a
petitioner?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
that
the
way
you're
ending
up?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
act
has
made
it
clear
that
the
interests
of
the
state
are
being
served
by
limiting
what
petitioners
can
do,
and
now
i
think
you're
saying
the
state's
interest
in
effect
cannot
be
served
at
all
unless
you
likewise
limit
what
a
court
sua
sponte
can
do.
in
fact,
if
i
may
just
add
one
thing,
you
said
a
moment
ago
if
you
don't
limit
what
a
court
can
do
you
in
effect
are
really
destroying
the
protection
of
the
act,
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
assumes
that
the
court
is
being
disingenuous
in
a
case
like
this,
that
it's
not
really
doing
what
it
says
sua
sponte.
what
it's
really
doing
is
just
using
some
words
to
make
an
end
run
around
the
limitation
upon
the
petitioner,
and
if
that's
the
basis
on
which
you
think
we
should
decide
this
case,
then
i
think
we
should...
i
think
you
and
we
should
be
explicit
in
talking
about
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
ms.
wilkens,
in
our
felker
opinion
we
dealt
with
several
different
issues,
and
one
of
them
was
a
case
where
it
was
not
clear
whether
the
aedpa
had
restricted
our...
the
court
of
jurisdiction
of
this
court,
but
we
nonetheless
said
that
the
exercise
of
our
discretion
would
be
guided
by
the
standards
that
were
made
applicable
to
the
lower
courts.
can't
you
make
the
same
argument
here,
not
that
the
aedpa
flatly
controls
the
action
of
a
court
as
opposed
to
the...
sua
sponte
court
as
opposed
to
acting
on
a
motion,
but
that
a
court,
in
exercising
its
discretion
to
recall
the
mandate,
has
to
bear
in
mind
what
the
aedpa
says?
unknown
speaker
but
how
does
the...
i
think
the
reason
i'm
having
trouble
is,
the
only
cases
i
can
think
of
where
as
a
circuit
we
recalled
a
mandate
were
things
like,
there
was
a
clerk
error.
the
clerk
sent
the
mandate
out
when
he
was
supposed
to
keep
it,
to
allow
time
for
cert,
for
example,
or
maybe
he
didn't
record
a
vote
that
somebody
got
in
late,
or
there
was
a
mix
up.
now,
surely
you
can't
suddenly
have
a
heightened
standard
from
aedpa.
it
just
doesn't
make
sense
to
apply
it
in
such
a
case.
unknown
speaker
so
you
must
be
thinking
of
a
certain
subset
of
recalls
of
mandates.
you
must
be
thinking
of
certain
circumstances
of
recalls
of
mandates.
i
would
have
thought
it
might
be
a
good
reason
to
recall
a
mandate
that
one
of
the
judges
got
mixed
up
about
what
time
he
had
to
have
the
vote
in,
nothing
to
do
with
aedpa.
that's
why
i'd
like
you
to
go
back
to
the
question
you've
been
asked.
what
is
the
standard
that
you
propose
for
deciding
here
that
there's
an
abuse
of
discretion?
what's
the
subcategory
you're
applying
it
to?
what's
the
rule
that
you
want
us
to
adapt...
adopt
in
that?
unknown
speaker
even
if
there
was
just
a
simple
clerical
mistake,
i
mean,
the
court
of
appeals
has
no
power--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
this
is
a...
it
seems
to
me
a
very
difficult
rule
that
you're
asking
us
to
adopt
for
a
case
where
you
have
some
other
substantial
arguments.
unknown
speaker
if
you
don't
want
to
make
them,
that's
your
problem.
unknown
speaker
what
were
you
do
if
there
were
a
clerical
error
and
the
mandate
had
been
issued?
unknown
speaker
you
know,
your
time's
about
up.
what
would
you
tell
us
if
we
said,
we
don't
accept
any
of
that?
it's
just
like
a
60(b)
motion,
and
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
en
banc
ruling
was
improper,
and
in...
that
we
should
reverse
it,
applying
ordinary
60(b)
standards
to
what
the
en
banc
panel
did?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
why
do
you
say
that?
i
mean,
i
just...
what's
the
thrust
of
your
reason
for
saying
what
they
did
under
any
ordinary
60(b)
standard
was
wrong?
unknown
speaker
why
can't
you
say
that
you
can't
recall
it
when
the
basis
on
which
you're
recalling
it
is
a
determination
that
it
was
wrong
on
the
merits,
which
would
be
the
same
basis
for
a
recall...
for
a
habeas
corpus
subsequent
review,
but
if
the
basis
is
that
there
has
been
some
clerical
error,
or
some
other
defect
of
that
sort,
then
it
can
be
recalled?
unknown
speaker
we
examine
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
unless
there's
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
applying
justice
scalia's
standard,
where
does
that
take
you
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
that's
right,
but
it's
also
clear,
isn't
it,
that
the
court
of
appeals
said,
we
made
a
procedural
error,
and
a
stage
in
our
review,
the
en
banc
stage,
was
cut
short
by
this
procedural
error.
two
judges
didn't
realize,
i
guess,
that
they
could
call
for
what
they
wanted
to
call
for.
so
which
prong
of
justice
scalia's
standard
does
this
case
fall
under?
does
it
fall
under
the...
the,
in
effect
the
procedural
mistake
prong,
and
therefore
we
say
it's
okay,
or
does
it
fall
under
the
error
of
law,
which
we
want
a
revised
prong,
in
which
case
we
say
it
doesn't?
what's
your
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but...
i
don't
want
to
play
with
words,
but
i
think
it's
the
case
that
under
the
rules
the
members
of
the
court
were
entitled
to
call
for
an
en
banc
standard
themselves.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
say
the
reason
it
wasn't
timely
was
that
we
made
a
procedural
mistake.
is
that
the
kind
of
mistake
which,
under
prong
1
of
the
standard,
may
be
considered
and
hence
legitimize
what
happens?
unknown
speaker
there's
nothing
to
reserve,
ms.
wilkens.
mr.
long,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
full
court
of
appeals
didn't
decide
to
rehear
it
sua
sponte.
unknown
speaker
after
it
got
to
the
panel
the
panel...
oh,
i
think
it's
very
clear
that
what
the
court
of
appeals
did
was
to
grant
the
motion
for
rehearing
in
banc
of
the
petitioner.
unknown
speaker
on
the
motion.
unknown
speaker
let's
find
where
it
is.
i
do
have
an
important
point
to
make.
where--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
have
any
pages?
unknown
speaker
--en
banc
opinion?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
wait,
a
sua
sponte
request
to
consider
en
banc.
what
is
a
sua
sponte
request?
unknown
speaker
one
of
the
judges
made
a
request.
unknown
speaker
this
doesn't
remotely
say
that
the
full
court,
a
majority
of
the
judges
in
active
service,
decided
sua
sponte
to
reexamine
that
decision.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
remotely
say
that.
unknown
speaker
oh,
the...
i
have
no
doubt
that
the
en
banc
court,
in
order
to
avoid
the
impediment
of
the
effective
death
penalty
act,
said
we
are
not
considering
this
at
the
instance
of
the
petitioner,
we're
considering
it
on
our
own,
but
the
question
is
whether
the
majority
of
the
judges
in
active
service
did
that.
unknown
speaker
and
that
proves
that
a
majority
of
the
active
judges
voted
to
do
this
sua
sponte?
unknown
speaker
it
proves
that
they
probably
had
enough
of
this
by
then.
the
whole
thing
was
quite
unseemly.
unknown
speaker
i
agree
with
that.
that's
quite
a
different
thing.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't
the
full
court
of
appeals.
it
was
a
panel.
i
mean,
let's
be
honest
here.
this
panel
was
being
technical.
it
was
using
a
technicality.
the
only
reason
it
said
we're
going
to
do
this
sua
sponte,
we're
not
reexamining
the
motion,
was
precisely
because
that
technicality
would
get
it
out
of
the
prohibitions
of
the
effective
death
penalty
act,
so
don't...
you
know,
it
seems
to
me
improper
for
you
to
say,
let's
not
be
technical,
when
we
look
at
whether
the
full
court
had
decided
to
do
that
or
not.
this
whole
thing
is
based
upon
technicalities.
unknown
speaker
no,
i
don't
think--
unknown
speaker
--when
you
say,
en
banc
panel,
you
mean
the
eleven
judges,
right?
unknown
speaker
there
is
some
enlightenment,
perhaps,
in
judge
kozinski's
opinion,
who
says,
on
july
7,
1997,
judge
z
sent
a
memorandum,
which
memorandum
he
said
called
for
a
belated
en
banc,
and
then
the
court's
order
as
a
whole
issued
on
july
30,
1997,
and
it
says,
the
full
court
has
voted
to
consider
whether
to
recall
mandate,
so
that
what
the
full
court
did,
it
looks
like
from
the
timing,
july
7,
a
judge
requested
a
belated
en
banc,
and
on
july
30
the
full
court
votes
to
consider
whether
to
recall
the
mandate.
i
don't
know
if
that's
helpful.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
all
the
en
banc
court
said
was
that
it,
the
en
banc
court,
was
acting
sua
sponte.
the
en
banc
court
never
said
that
the
full
majority
of
active
judges
in
the
ninth
circuit
was
acting
sua
sponte.
they
never
said
that.
i
can
take
them
at
their
word,
but
their
word
only
establishes
that
11
of
the
judges
were
acting
sua
sponte.
unknown
speaker
no,
only
insofar
as
rule
35a
is
concerned,
which
is
a
very
narrowly
segregable
rule
which
requires
that
the
en
banc
vote
have
the
acquiescence,
or
the
affirmative
vote
of
a
majority
of
active
judges,
and
if
the
issue
is
whether
the
ninth
circuit
was
considering
this
sua
sponte
or
rather
upon
the
motion
of
the
petitioner,
the
only
thing
the
ninth
circuit
did
under
35a
was
to
consider
it
on
the
motion
of
the
petitioner.
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
that's
like
saying
that
congress'
failure
to
enact
legislation
is
the
equivalent
of
its
enacting
the
opposite,
but
it
isn't.
i
mean,
there's
a
wholly
different
inertia.
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry
for
taking
so
much
of
your
time
on
this,
but
this
is
an
important
point
to
my
view
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
i
will--
unknown
speaker
--do
i
understand
that
your
basic
position
on
this
is
that
those
11
members
of
the
ninth
circuit
are
like
the
12
members
of,
say,
the
d.c.
circuit
for
all
purposes?
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
only
circuit
that
has
this
at
the
moment,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
that
power
i
assume
is
controlled
by
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
unknown
speaker
and
how
does
the
judge
exercise
his
or
her
discretion
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
habeas
proceedings
have
gone
on
for
some,
i
think,
9
years,
7
years
in
the
federal
courts
alone.
what
is
the
standard
for
upsetting
a
previously
final
judgment
by
withdrawing
the
mandate?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
the
context
that's
habeas
corpus,
don't
you
think
it
ought
to
be
to
avoid
a
miscarriage
of
justice?
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that's
the
standard
that
we've
applied
generally
in
habeas
corpus
successive
petition
cases,
and
this
circumstance
that
we're
faced
with
raises
all
of
the
intrusive
concerns
on...
that
we
have
with
reference
to
the
federal
system.
unknown
speaker
but
what
happens
here,
the
court
of
appeals
waits
until
this
court
has
denied
certiorari,
until
the
state
has
mobilized
all
of
its
forces
and
its
moral
will
to
execute
this
penalty,
the
governor
has
held
lengthy
and
very
careful
clemency
hearings,
and
then
the
court
of
appeals,
based
on
the
recitation
that
two
of
the
judges
didn't
read
their
e
mail,
stops
the
process,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
quite
squarely
invokes
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
an
abuse
of
discretion.
unknown
speaker
and
it
seems
to
me
that
discretion
can
only
be
exercised
if
there
was
a...
if
necessary
to
avoid
a
manifest
miscarriage
of
justice.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
does
compound
the
injury
done
to
the
state.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
measure
the
53
days
after
the
matter
has
been
pending
for
7
years,
and
this
court
has
acted.
unknown
speaker
before
it
was
what
in
the
district
court?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
couldn't
do
that
until
it
withdrew
the
mandate,
and
the
mandate
indicates
sufficient
finality
for
this
court
to
act.
it
indicates
sufficient
finality
for
the
governor
to
act.
it
indicates
sufficient
finality
for
the
sentence
of
death
to
be
executed.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
even
you
agree,
and
i
think
you
have
to,
that
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
must
be
imposed.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
have
to
have
an
abuse
of
discretion
before
you
have
an
en
banc
hearing.
unknown
speaker
so
the
issuance
of
the
mandate
is
a
very
highly
significant
fact
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
that
there
are
any
number.
there
are
some,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
questioning
that.
i'm
asking
whether
a
miscarriage
of
justice
standard
shouldn't
apply
because
of
the
special
concerns
with
habeas
corpus
and
intrusion
on
the
processes
of
the
states.
unknown
speaker
in
england
there
isn't
any
collateral
review
of
criminal
conviction,
so
that
to
say
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
has
applied
in
england,
i
don't
think
carries
you
over
to
this
very
particular
situation
where
you're
dealing
with
something
where
this
court
has
gradually
circumscribed
the
free
wheeling
availability
of
the
writ,
and
congress
has
circumscribed
it.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
isn't
this
case.
unknown
speaker
but
i
think...
isn't
it
just
as
likely
congress
didn't
remove
it
because
they
couldn't
conceive
of
something
like
this
happening?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that
congress
perhaps
contemplating
this
legislation
could
have
canvassed
courts
of
appeals
habeas
opinions
and
not
found
any
example
in
those
particular
opinions
where
a...
where
the
mandate
had
been
withdrawn
under
circumstances
like
this.
it
just
didn't
seem
to
be
a
problem.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
were...
there
is
no
right,
though,
to
an
en
banc
hearing.
you
have
to
concede
that.
unknown
speaker
they
were
put
in
motion,
but
they
didn't
take
effect,
and
in
the
meantime
the
habeas
proceedings
became
final,
and
they
are
habeas
proceedings,
so
we
are
confronted
with
what
standard
to
apply,
and
there
certainly
are
arguments
to
make
it
a
fairly
high
standard
for
a
reversal
here,
it
seems
to
me,
by
the
ninth
circuit.
unknown
speaker
simply
the
fact
that
it's
a
habeas
proceeding,
where
we
have
established
some
higher
standards
generally.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
this
petitioner's
motions,
if
they
were
governed
here
by
aedpa,
and
maybe
they're
not
because
of
the
effective
date
problem,
but
if
they
were,
would
his
motions
under
60(b)
and
so
forth
be
in
violation
of
aedpa,
and
in
effect
be
a
second--
unknown
speaker
--that's
true.
unknown
speaker
was
that
an
en
banc
decision?
unknown
speaker
what
standard
would
you
apply
for
abuse
of
discretion?
i'm
thinking
particularly,
because
you
mentioned
earlier,
you
said
it
isn't...
it...
some
things...
the
most
obvious
case
where
you
would
withdraw
mandate
is...
it
doesn't
happen
too
often
because
of
local
rules,
but
under
the
rules,
the
opinion
is
written
at
the
court
of
appeals,
it
comes
down,
then
you
can
file
a
petition
for
rehearing.
this
is
nothing
to
do
with
en
banc.
then
seven
days
after
the
filing
of
that
petition,
the
mandate
issues.
now,
i
take
it
under
the
appellate
rules
a
litigant
could
any
time,
perhaps,
or
sometime
thereafter,
or
after
the
petition
for
rehearing,
file
a
petition
en
banc,
and
by
the
time
the
court
as
a
whole
has
considered
that
petition
the
7
days
may
have
passed
and
the
mandate
is
issued,
so
obviously,
if
they
grant
the
en
banc
they'll
jerk
the
mandate
back.
now,
that's
the
most
obvious
situation
where
the...
all
right.
now,
given
that
situation
and
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedures,
it
could
happen,
which
would
i
think
be
an
abuse,
that
a
court
decides
on
its
own
10
years
later,
you
see,
to
review
en
banc,
and
jerks
back
the
mandate.
well,
that
can't
be
right,
so
there
must
be
some
kind
of
standard
in
between
what
would
be
the
rules
foreseeing
a
not
totally
unusual
circumstance...
you
know,
we
as
a
court
of
appeals
grant
the
en
banc,
the
mandate
went
out
last
week,
we'd
better
jerk
it
back,
because
after
all
we're
considering
it
en
banc...
and
10
years
later.
there
must
be
some
standard,
and
you
mentioned...
or
maybe
it's
a
different
thing,
nothing
to
do
with
jerking
the
mandate
back,
but
whether
you
can
have
an
en
banc
at
all,
all
right.
i
mean,
so
those
are...
that's
what's
going
on
in
my
mind,
and
you
mentioned
that
you
had
in
mind
some
kind
of
standard,
or
some
kind
of
criteria
for
resolving
this
problem,
and
so
i'd
like
to
hear
it.
unknown
speaker
wouldn't
you
also
look
to
the
effect
on
the
parties,
or
those
generally
who
rely
on
the
decision,
even
if
the
recall
were
a
more
prompt
one?
unknown
speaker
as
a
guide,
how
about
the
old
common
law
rule
that
during
the
term
you
could
recall
a
mandate?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
now--
--but
it
might
give
you
some
handle
on
how
many...
how
long
is
too
long.
unknown
speaker
you
said
in
response
to
my
question
that
if
we
did
look
to
the
effect
on
others,
even
if
a
more
prompt
recall,
your
case
would
still
turn
out
favorably
to
you,
and
maybe
you're
right.
should
we
consider
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals,
before
it
exercised
its
sua
sponte
authority,
waited
for
all
of
these
other
bodies
to
go
through
various
procedures
of
review?
they
sat
back
to
see
what
would
happen.
is
that
something
we
should
consider,
and
how
does
that
cut?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
did...
well,
because
time
is
short,
there's
one
thing
that
i
wish
you
would
address.
does
it
go
to
the
seriousness
with
which
we
should
consider
the
claim
that
they
were
trying,
in
effect,
to
protect
the
integrity
of
their
own
procedures?
because
if
that
had
been
weighted
given
a
very
high
weight,
wouldn't
they
have
said,
we've
got
to
protect
the
integrity
of
our
own
procedures
regardless
of
what
all
these
other
courts
and
executive
agencies
may
be
doing,
and
would
it
be
fair
for
us
to
say,
the
circuit
really
did
not
give
a
very
high
weight
to
the
integrity
of
their
procedures,
and
that
bears
on
whether
it
was
an
abuse
of
discretion?
unknown
speaker
it's
hard
to
conceive
that
wanting
to
conceal
its
own
ineptitude
takes
priority
over
allowing
the
state
to
execute
its
criminal
law.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
