ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court--
when
this
court
denied
thomas
thompson's
petition
for
certiorari
on
june
2,
1997,
his
first
federal
habeas
proceedings
became
final.
from
that
point
forward,
any
litigation
in
either
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
would
constitute
an
impermissible
second
bite
of
the
apple
unless
the
specific
limitations
of
the
effective
death
penalty
act
were
met.
it
makes
no
difference
if
that
second
bite
of
the
apple
occurs
upon
the
motion
of
the
inmate
or
on
the
court's
own
motion.
the
adverse
effect
upon
the
state's
judgment
and
the
state's
interest
in
comity
and
finality
of
that
judgment--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--well,
first,
in
distinguishing
between
an
ordinary
civil
case
and
a
2254
case
i
don't
perceive
any
limitations
on
an
ordinary
civil
case.
however--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
note
that
there
are
these
standards
that
have
been
cited
in
the
cases
that
have
been
cited.
it
is
a
very...
apparently
a
very
broad
standard.
it's
made
on
a
case
by
case
ad
hoc
decision
with
respect
to
exceptional
or
extraordinary
circumstances.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
would
invite
the
court
to
look
to
the
federal
rule
of
appellate
procedure
22a,
wherein
congress
has
recently
delineated
a
role
for
the
courts
of
appeal
as
a
gatekeeper.
they
have
removed
significantly
the
original
jurisdiction
for
habeas
corpus
proceedings
from
the
court
of
appeals
and
instead
have
transferred
the
screening
process
that
was
previously
in
the
district
courts,
and
they
have
placed
that
with
the
court
of
appeals,
thereby
significantly--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--well,
it
does
not
specifically
reference
the
recall
of
the
mandate.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
it
most
assuredly
speaks
to
finality,
and,
in
fact,
section
2244
as
amended
by
the
effective
death
penalty
act
is
entitled
finality,
interjects
res
judicata
into
habeas
corpus,
and
specifically
delineates
the
narrow
circumstances
under
which
additional
litigation
will
occur.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
once...
it
would
be
if
the
first
petition
were
final
and
it
becomes
final
upon
the
expiration
of
time
for
filing
certiorari
in
this
court
or
this
court's
denial
of
certiorari.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
that's
correct.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
well,
your
honor,
there's
precedent
for
the
actions
of
the
court
being
considered
within
the
confines
of
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine.
in
in
re
blodgett
the
court
of
appeals
was
instructed
of
its
duty
not
to
delay
habeas
corpus
proceedings.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
well,
certainly
there
are
several
ways
to
analyze
it,
and
if
this
court
does
not
consider
that
we
have
passed
into
the
successive
petition
area
within
respect
to
the
effective
death
penalty
act,
most
assuredly,
as
this
court
was
informed
by
the
effective
death
penalty
act
in
determining
felker,
we
do
not
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
should
be
any
less
informed
by
the
limitations
upon
relitigating
the
same
claims
on
the
same
facts
and
the
same
law.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
believe
there
are
instances
where
that
has
in
fact
occurred,
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
believe
so,
and
again
this
unique
nature
of
2254
cases
has
been
repeatedly
recognized
by
this
court,
and
most
recently,
even
in
the
agostini
case,
there
was
a
citation
to
teague
as
an
express
acknowledgement
as
to
the
distinctions
between
procedural
rule's
ordinary
application
in
the
ordinary
civil
case.
the
recall
of
the
mandate
standard
is
entirely
too
broad
to
be
applied
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
whether
it's
upon
the
court's
own
motion
or
not.
the
effect
upon
the
state's
interest
remains
the
same.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
well,
it's
most
assuredly
an
abuse
of
discretion,
but
we
need
not
even
reach
the
traditional
abuse
of
discretion
standard
because
they're
applying
the
wrong
standard,
because
you
must
turn
to
the
applicable
law.
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine,
which
has
been--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--in
a
timely
manner
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes,
your
honor.
once
this
court
denied
certiorari,
the
first
federal
habeas
proceeding
came
to
an
end,
and--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
no,
your
honor.
it's
our
position
that
the
full
court
voted
on
the
question
whether
or
not
to
reconsider
what
was
before
the
three
judge
panel,
and
that
was
mr.
thompson's
motion.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
that's
correct,
and
we
have
questioned
how
you
can
rehear
something
that
was
not
before
the
three
judge
panel.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
would
say
this
is
clearly
distinguishable,
your
honor.
the
only
indication
that
the
action
was
sua
sponte--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--is
what
they
said
at
the
time
they
acted
sua
sponte.
there's
nothing
contemporaneous
with
the
full
court
vote,
or
even
notifying
the
parties
prior
to
argument.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes,
your
honor.
i
can
only
address
that
by
emphasizing
that
this
is
a
collateral
review
of
a
collateral
review
of
a
state
court
decision,
and
with
respect
to
collaterally
reviewing
the
collateral
review,
which
is
the
types
of
unusual
circumstances
that
may
be
of
concern,
there
is
absolutely
nothing
improper,
or
even
harsh,
about
limiting
the
courts
of
appeals'
ability
to
undertake
the
types
of
things
that
occurred
in
this
case.
this
is
a
state
court
judgment
and
conviction
in
a
murder
case,
and
it
is
not
akin
to
a
civil
litigant
who
perhaps
may
be
denied
access
to
the
federal
court
in
a
trial
level
or
even
in
the
direct
appeal.
the
direct
appeal
concluded
in
this
case
10
years
ago,
and
it
has
been
collaterally
reviewed
in
state
and
federal
court
since,
and
any
of
the
unusual
circumstances
that
would
ordinarily
be
of
concern
should
be
of
no
concern
at
this
point
in
the
process.
if
we
continue
to
allow
such
a
vague
general
standard
out
of
concern
for
the
courts
of
appeals'
power,
we
are
in
effect
adding
an
additional
layer
of
review
in
state
capital
cases.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes,
your
honor.
it's
different
because
there's
no
restrictions
upon
this
court
entertaining
additional
litigation--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--again,
the
courts
of
appeals
no
longer
have
original
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction.
this
is
because
congress
has
determined
that
there
is
no
further
need--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--our
position,
your
honor,
once
that
first
federal
habeas
proceeding--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--it
must--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--because
you're
not
a
court
of
appeal.
you're
the
highest
court
in
this
country,
and
your
jurisdiction
is
not
limited.
the
jurisdiction
of
the
courts
of
appeal
has
been
limited.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes,
your
honor.
when
the
first
federal
habeas
proceeding
comes
to
a
close
the
courts
of
appeal
must
be
mindful
of
the
limitations
upon
successive
litigation.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
that
would
be
with
the
denial
of
certiorari
by
this
court
or
the
expiration
of
time
for
seeking
certiorari.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
griffith
v.
kentucky,
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
griffith
v.
kentucky,
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
think
that
in
the
context
of
habeas
corpus
litigation
that
that
is
an
inappropriate...
an
inappropriate
consideration.
by
waiting
to
see
what
other
courts
do,
you're
no
different
than
a
habeas
corpus
litigant
who
gambles
and
then
interjects
into
the
process
in
the
eleventh
hour
that
there
is
a
difficulty.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
your
honor,
significantly,
it
really
matters
little
in
the
context
of
federal
habeas
corpus
in
the
long
run
as
to
whether
or
not
this
was
pre
effective
death
penalty
act
or
post
effective
death
penalty
act,
because
it
would
be
our
position
that
the
abuse
of
the
writ
doctrine
should
also
have
informed
the
ninth
circuit.
there
have
been
cases
where
you
do
not
entertain
a
60(b)
motion
in
a
district
court
in
a
habeas
corpus
proceeding
without
considering
this
court's
doctrines
and
evolving
law
in
terms
of
concern
for
endless
repetitive
habeas
corpus
litigation.
and
with
respect
to
the
concerns
of
the
court
over
its
mistakes
and
the
very
serious
nature
of
this
case,
i
can
only
indicate
that
this
court
prior
to
congress,
and
now
congress,
has
balanced
the
competing
interests
of
criminal
defendants
and
the
state,
and
they
have
decided
that
a
mistake
by
a
court
of
appeal
is
not
sufficient
to
litigate
the
same
claims
on
the
same
facts
and
the
same
law.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
your
honor,
i
believe
there
must
be
a
distinct
standard
once
the
first
habeas
corpus
proceeding
has
become
final,
otherwise
it
is
a
way
to
circumvent
all
of
this
court's
law
controlling--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--yes,
definitely.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
i
would
urge
this
court
to
engraft
the
standard
from
congress'
enactment
of
the
effective
death
penalty
act,
otherwise
a
vehicle
is
left
open
to
circumvent--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--the
only
means
by
which--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--well,
miscarriage
of
justice
has
been
heightened
by
the
effective
death
penalty
act,
and
i--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--your
honor,
it's
not
my
intention
to
identify
the
court
with
the
petitioner.
however--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--well,
the
interests
of
the
state
need
to
be
preserved,
and
if--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--well,
your
honor,
i
tried
not
to
delineate
between
disingenuous
and
well
intentioned
with
the
belief
that
it's
important
to
preserve
the
state's
interests,
and
if
a
recall
of
a
mandate
is
upon
anything
less
than
a
miscarriage
of
justice,
whether
sua
sponte
or
by
the
inmate,
then
the
state's
interests
are
not
being
preserved.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
yes,
your
honor,
that
would
protect
the
state's
interests.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
the
rule
of
law
would
be
that
a
court
entertaining
a
motion
to
recall
would
deem
that...
if
it
came
from
the
inmate
would
deem
it
to
be
a
successive
application.
if
the
court
were
acting
sua
sponte,
it
must
be
informed
by--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--no,
your
honor--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--no,
your
honor--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--we
are
not
addressing
clerical
error.
these
are
situations
where
the
court
intended
to
issue
the
mandate,
and
the
mandate
has
issued.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
they
could
correct
the
clerical
error.
they
could
not
alter
the
judgment.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
if
you
apply
the
rule
60(b)
standards--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--consistent
with
this
court's
own
authority
you
must
engraft
the
applicable
law
from
habeas
corpus,
and
if
the
actions
of
the
ninth
circuit,
sua
sponte
or
otherwise,
are
considered
under
ordinary
rules
applicable
to
60(b),
the
result
in
this
case
could
not
have
occurred,
and
we
do
urge
the
court
to
make
it
abundantly
clear
that--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--because
it
undermines
every
decision
from
this
court
on
abuse
of
the
writ.
it
certainly
undermines
every
act
of
congress
designed
to
curtail
the
abuse
of
the
writ.
it
opens
the
door--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--yes,
your
honor.
you
cannot
use
this
as
a
vehicle
to
simply
revisit
a
case
to
apply
well
established--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--right,
establish
well
established
law
to
the
same
facts
and
come
up
with
a
contrary
result--
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
--exactly.
you
must
meet
that
standard.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
well,
in
this
case
it's
quite
clear
that
mr.
thompson
could
not
make
a
showing
of
a
miscarriage
of
justice.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
it
certainly
does
not
fall
under
the
procedural
prong
because
mr.
thompson
was
not
entitled
to
en
banc
process.
you
certainly
apply
the
miscarriage
of
justice
standard.
mr.
thompson
is
not...
was
not
scheduled
to
be
executed
because
he
was
denied
the
benefit
of
an
en
banc
vote.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
in
a
timely
manner.
not
after
the
denial
of
certiorari.
ms.
holly
d.
wilkens
no,
because
it
could
conceivably
alter
the
judgment.
it
is
not
a
mandate
issued
erroneously.
the
court
knew
that
judge
x
and
y
had
not
called
for
a
vote.
the
full
court
knew
it.
they
sat
silent
for
5
months
until
this
court
denied
certiorari,
until
there
were
additional
state
court
proceedings.
that
is
not
a
mandate
that
was
issued
inadvertently
by
the
clerk
without
the
knowledge
of
the
court,
and
it
is
not
a
clerical
mistake.
it
is
a
change
in
the
perceptions
of
the
court,
and
in
capital
cases
we
cannot
have
those
kinds
of
uncertainties
in
the
eleventh
hour
characterized
as
a
procedural
defect
justified.
that's
not
a
clerical
mistake.
that's
not
that
there's
something
in
the
judgment
that's
wrong,
or
that
the
mandate
issued
by
the
clerk's
office
without
communication
between
the
court,
and
i
think
that
it's
important
to
be
mindful
of
the
fact
that
this
case
has
been
17
years
in
the
making,
and
was
brought
back
to
the
court
of
appeal...
the
en
banc
process
is
not
a
sufficient
process
to
take
the
state
and
add
another
level
of
collateral
review
at
that
point
in
time.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
reserve.
