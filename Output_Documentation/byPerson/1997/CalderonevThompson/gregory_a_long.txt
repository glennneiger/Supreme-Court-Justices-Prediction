mr.
gregory
a.
long
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
sua
sponte
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
rehear
mr.
thompson's
first
petition
en
banc
was
a
proper
exercise
of
judicial
authority,
and
in
no
way
implicates
the
effective
death
penalty
act.
that
is
for
two
reasons
here.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
think
that
we
don't
know--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--certainly
they
did
that,
your
honor.
at
joint
appendix
194
is
the
order
of
the
court
signed
by
judge
hug,
the
chief
judge,
setting
forth
the
decision
of
the
full
court
to
set
the
matter
down
for
argument
to
determine
whether
to
rehear
it
en
banc,
and
of
course
the
full
court
was
asked
by
an
active
judge
of
the
court
to
disavow
the
decision
of
the
panel,
and
that
motion
failed
because
it
failed
to
obtain
a
majority
of
the
active
judges
to
support
it,
so
in
fact
at
least
at
two
points
in
time
the
full
court,
all
active
judges
considered
this
issue,
agreed
that
there
should
be
an
en
banc
hearing,
or
at
least
the
consideration
of
an
en
banc
hearing,
and
then
later--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--no,
on
no
motion.
sua
sponte.
there's
no
motion
whatsoever.
as
the
court
mentions
there
was
a--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--there
was
a
sua
sponte
suggestion
that
the
court
should
take
the
matter
en
banc.
that
was
after
the
mandate
issued,
but
before
the
mandate
was
spread
in
the
district
court.
at
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--yes.
i
think
at
about
215
of
the
joint
appendix,
chief
justice,
and
if
i
may
check
for
one
moment,
i
believe
that's
where
it's
discussed.
yes,
at
page
215
of
the
joint
appendix,
at
the
first
full
paragraph,
a
sua
sponte
request--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--this
is
the
en
banc
opinion.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
a
sua
sponte
request
to
consider
en
banc
whether
to
recall
the
mandate
was
made
shortly
thereafter,
meaning
after
the
mandate
issued,
but
before
it
was
spread.
through
a
consultative
process
the
court
decided
to
postpone
action
on
whether
sua
sponte
to
recall
the
mandate
until
after
thompson
concluded
his
state
court,
et
cetera,
proceedings.
i
take
it
from
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--i
take
it
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--i
know
no
more
than
what
is
set
forth
in
the
opinion,
your
honor,
so
we're
left
to
speculate
on
that.
i
don't--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--well,
i
believe
that--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--i
believe
that
the
en
banc
court
makes
that
clear
in
its
opinion.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
my
answer
is
yes,
clearly
they
did,
and
the
reason
they
did
clearly
is
that
after
the
opinion
was
issued
an
active
judge
in
the
ninth
circuit
called
for
the
full
court
to
vote
on
whether
to
withdraw
the
matter
from
the
en
banc
panel.
that
motion
failed,
because
it
failed
to
garner
the
support
of
a
majority
of
the
active
judges
of
the
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
it...
what
it
proves
to
me,
justice
scalia,
is
that
a
majority
of
the--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--what
it
proves
to
me,
justice
scalia,
is
that
all
of
the
active
judges
had
an
opportunity
to
question
or
to
repudiate
a
misstatement
of
fact
contained
in
the
en
banc
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
and
further,
under
missouri
v.
jenkins,
this
court's
decision,
this
court
has
often
indicated
that
it
will
accept
at
its
word
an
explanation
given
by
a
court
of
appeals
for
its
actions.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
respectfully
disagree
with
you
on
that,
justice
scalia.
i
don't
think
it's
based
on
technicalities
at
all.
i
think
that
if
we
follow
your
line
of
reasoning,
then
we
must
assume
that
all
actions
of
an
en
banc
panel
as
it's
constituted
under
rule
35
of
the
circuit
are
less
than
the
actions
of
the
en
banc
court,
and
that
cannot
be,
and
therefore
it
seems
to
me
that
when
the
en
banc
panel
of
the
court
speaks,
it
speaks
with
all
of
the
dignity
of
the
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
the
court
then
is
at
liberty
to
withdraw
from
the
panel.
it
did
not
do
so.
it
specifically
declined
to
do
so
in
this
case.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
that
is
consistent
with
the
procedure
in
which
all
of
the
active
judges
of
the
circuit
must
vote
on
whether
to
do
so.
i
assume
that
that
vote
occurred,
but
i
have
no
visibility
into
the
internal
workings
of
the
court,
and
similarly
i
think
that's
why
this
court
in
missouri
v.
jenkins
said
that
this
court
will
accept
the
word
of
the
court
of
honor...
excuse
me,
of
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
issue,
and
i
believe
in
that
case
it
was
the
en
banc
court
in
the
eighth
circuit.
even
if
this
act
were
to
apply
to
the--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--but
justice
scalia,
they
were
acting
as
the
ninth
circuit,
properly
constituted
in
accordance
with
the
rules
of
that
circuit
and
with
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
to
follow
your
line
of
reasoning,
then,
whatever
they
say
would
not
speak
on
behalf
of
the
whole
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
except
that
there
was
the
later
requires
to
withdraw
it
from
the
panel,
also
under
rule
35a,
that
was
declined
by
the
full
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
well,
your
honor,
i
think
that
in
light
of
my
time
i
must
beg
to
differ
with
the
court
on
this
issue.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
understand
that
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
wish
i
could
convince
you
to
the
contrary,
but
i
think
i
must
move
on.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
absolutely,
your
honor.
both
the
safety
valve
that
the
full
court
has
given
the
opportunity
on
request
of
any
active
judge
to
vote
to
withdraw
that
reference,
as
it
were,
from
the
en
banc
panel,
and
to
take
the
matter
as
a
full
court
with
all
of
the
active
judges
sitting.
here,
they
expressly
declined
to
do
so
after
they
had
an
opportunity
to
review
the
disposition
of
the
en
banc
panel.
i...
justice
scalia
and
i
disagree
about
the
implications
to
be
drawn
from
that.
to
me,
it
is
as
if
it
were
affirmed
on
all
of
its
reasons.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
believe
that's
correct.
even
if
the
act
were
to
apply
to
this
case,
it
seems
to
me
that
no
different
result
would
obtain,
because
the
act
is
not
addressed
by
its
language.
the
power
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
withdraw
their
mandate
and
to
hear
cases
en
banc--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--yes,
your
honor.
as
the
chief
justice
suggested
in
the
hawaii
housing
case,
as
in
chambers,
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard
would
apply.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
well,
if
i
may
quarrel
with
the
previously
final
judgment
a
bit
later,
i'll
answer
your
question
directly.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
standard
for
exercising
discretion
to
withdraw
the
mandate
is
no
different
in
this
case
than
it
is
in
any
other
case,
and
that
standard
has
been
variously
described
by
the
courts
of
appeals
in
their
decisions
for
good
cause,
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
the
judicial
process--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--no,
i
do...
i
would
not
agree
with
that
standard,
your
honor.
i
would
not
cabin
the
authority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
in
this
limited
range
of
cases,
because
i
do
not
see
any
principle
basis
for
distinguishing
between
them
on
the
one
hand
and
the
wide
variety
of
civil
cases
on
the
other.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
do
not
believe
that
this
is
similar
to
a
successive
petition
case,
and
i
believe
that's
the
case
for
several
reasons.
first,
congress
was
very
careful
in
striking
the
balance
in
the
legislation
that
it
adopted
after
a
number
of
years
of
debate
and
reviewing
a
number
of
bills.
to
speak
in
terms
of
a
second--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--your
honor--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--there
are
a
number
of
points
that
you
raised
in
your
question.
first
of
all,
it
was
not
simply
a
mistake
by
two
judges.
the
en
banc
panel
sets
forth
at
pages
214
through
216
of
the
appendix
a
series
of
misunderstandings
and
mistakes
that
involve
at
least
six
judges
of
the
court,
not
two,
and
further,
if
it
be
a
mistake
that
the
ninth
circuit
waited
to
take
the
vote
on
whether
to
hear
it
en
banc
until
at
some
later
point
in
time,
then
again
that
is
not
a
mistake
that
is
due
to
my
client's
failure
to
do
something.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
it's
a
53-day
injury,
your
honor.
it's
not
a
significant--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--but
my
point
is,
your
honor,
if
they
had
withdrawn
the
mandate,
let
us
say,
before
it
was
spread
in
the
district
court,
then
would
we
be
here?
mr.
gregory
a.
long
before
it
was
spread
in
the
district
court,
your
honor...
would
we
be
here?
i
doubt
it.
if
we
had
been
accorded
the
opportunity
that
every
other
litigant
is
accorded
to
have
an
en
banc
suggestion
considered
in
accordance
with
the
proper
procedures
set
forth
by
the
ninth
circuit
in
its
local
rules,
no
one
would
be
quarreling
with
where
we
are
right
now,
or
with
the
decision
of
the
en
banc
court.
there
may
be
a
quarrel,
but
certainly
not
on
the
grounds
we're
discussing
now.
what
the
ninth
circuit
did
was
to
preserve
the
integrity
of
its
processes
by
putting
us
back
to
the
status
quo
ante
before--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--well,
that
is
true,
your
honor,
but
that
sort
of...
in
my
view
that
is
circular
in
reasoning,
because
you...
it's
like
saying
that
it's
not
final
until
it's
final,
or
it's
final
because
it's
final.
here,
if
we
recognize
the
continuing
authority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
recall
their
mandates--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
no,
you
do
not.
it's
clear
under--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--but,
your
honor,
there
are
any
number
of
cases
in
which
mandates
have
been
recalled
after
the
certiorari
has
been
denied
and
the
mandate
has
issued.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
there...
we
cite
the
sargent
case,
we
cite
the
alphin
case,
and
there
are
others
in
our
brief
that
we
can
refer
to,
so
this
is
not
a
peculiar
act
either
in
this
case
or
in
this
category
of
cases.
the
courts
of
appeals
have,
for
200
years,
and
before
that
the
courts
of
england
had
the
authority
to
withdraw
their
mandates
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
process.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
and
my
answer
is
no,
it
should
not.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that.
that's
merely
something
that
this
court
observed
in
hazel
atlas,
when
it
was
talking
about
the
inherent
authority
of
the
courts
to
recall
their
mandates,
and
this
court
noted
that
that
authority
had
existed
even
before
the
republic
was
founded.
it's
continued
to
exist
up
to
this
point
in
time.
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
authority
can
be
exercised
without
any
boundaries,
nor
am
i
suggesting
that
this
court
was
wrong
in
felker
when
it
said
that
the
actions
of
the
court
ought
to
be
informed
by
aedpa.
indeed,
the
ninth
circuit
has
demonstrated
already
to
this
court
and
to
all
others
that
it
is
informed
by
that.
that's
the
nevius
case,
where
they
refused--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--well,
no,
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
court
was
at
pains
to
point
out
that
first
the
act
does
not
apply
to
this
case
because
the
petition
was
filed
before
the
effective
date
of
the
act,
so
under
this
court's
decision
in
lindh
there
is
no
application
whatsoever.
that's
why
i
think
that
we
need
not
discuss
aedpa
and
its
application
to
this
case.
even
if
the
act
applied,
it's
my
view
that
congress
certainly
did
not
remove
the
authority
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
recall
their
mandates
and
hear
cases
en
banc.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
no,
your
honor,
i...
in
the
first
place,
we
would
be
speculating
about
congressional
intent,
but
i
think
that
the
statute
is
carefully
drafted.
if
you
look
at
2244(b)(1)
and
then
at
2244
(b)(3)(e),
you
see
that
what
congress
is
talking
about
is
second
or
successive
petitions,
and
it's
saying
that
those
may
not
be
entertained
by
the
court
of
appeals
and,
indeed,
that
no
petition
for
a
rehearing
of
a
denial
or
grant
of
the
right
to
file
a
successor
petition
could
be
heard.
it
does
not
speak
at
all
to
withdrawing
the
mandate
or
to
the
authority
of
the
court
to
entertain
a
suggestion
to
rehear
it
en
banc.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
well,
and
i
think
that
is
true,
your
honor,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
was
very
careful
to
note
this
is
a
once
in
a
decade,
or
many
decades
case.
i
don't
believe
that
this
is
a
case
that's
going
to
invite
the
avalanche
of
similar
cases.
i
would
refer
to
the
court's
opinion,
justice
o'connor
writing
for
the
court
in
agostini,
where
she
indicated
that
that
case
was
very
much
confined
to
the
context
of
the
case.
similarly
here.
we
have
a
series
of
misunderstandings
and
errors
by
a
united
states
court
of
appeal
that
deprived
an
individual
of
the
rights
that
all
other
individuals
have--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--i
absolutely
concede
that,
your
honor.
the
right
under
this
court's
decisions
in
shenker
and
western
pacific
railway
company
is
to
know
the
procedures
that
are
available
and
to
have
the
opportunity
to
put
them
into
motion.
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
in--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
principle
basis
for
distinguishing
these
cases
from
all
other
civil
cases,
justice
o'connor.
if
there
were,
i
would--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--as
ms.
wilkens
considered
earlier
in
response
to
a
question,
the
standard
has
always
been
the
same,
so
what
the
state
is
asking
this
court
to
do
now
is
to
be
a
back
up
legislature
and
to
amend
the
aedpa,
as
it
were,
to
infer
that
congress
meant
to
take
away
authority
from
the
courts
of
appeals
that
it
does
not
explicitly
do
so.
it's
our
position
that
in
adopting
that
legislation
congress
was
very
careful
to
strike
a
balance
in
a
very
complex
area
of
the
law.
if
one
reviews
the
legislative
history,
it
is
replete
with
statements
from
congresspersons
and
senators.
there
were
two
concepts
that
they
were
concerned
about.
one
is
cutting
down
second
and
successive
petitions
by
petitioners,
and
the
other
was
to
make
certain
that
every
petitioner
had
a
full
and
fair
opportunity
to
litigate
his
or
her
case.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
that,
of
course,
is
a
question
that
i
need
not
decide,
and
i
think
it's
not
the
question
that's
posed
to
this
court.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
would
go
so
far
as
to
say
this.
under
the
ninth
circuit
authority,
if
the
60(b)
motion
were
to
attempt
to
place
new
or
different
claims
before
the
court,
then
under
the
greenawalt
case,
which
is
at
85
f.
3d,
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
that
will
not
be
permitted.
that's
another
example,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
of
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
ninth
circuit
being
informed
by
the
intent
of
the
act,
just
as
this
court
announced
that
it
would
be
informed
by
the
intent
of
the
act--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
it
was
not.
there
also
is
the
nevius
case,
which
i
mentioned
earlier,
where
the
circuit
declined
to
recall
its
mandate
when
the
purpose
was
to
present
new
and
different
claims,
and
that's
why
this
case
is
very
different
from
that,
but
nevius
should
indicate
to
this
court
that
the
ninth
circuit
does
recognize
that
its
discretion
should
be
informed
by
the
act.
it
is
quite
capable
of
turning
away
end
runs
around
the
act,
and
it
has
demonstrated
that
it
has
done
so
in
the
past,
so
i
think
that
this
fear
is
much
exaggerated.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
well,
i
think,
justice
breyer,
that
the
courts
of
appeals
have
struggled
with
precisely
that
question
over
the
course
of
many
years,
and
as
one
reviews
the
cases
that
are
set
out
in
notes
17
and
19
of
our
brief
you
see
that
the
courts
have
come
up
with
certain
phrases
that
they
use
to
describe
the
process
they
go
through...
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
court's
processes,
to...
for
good
cause,
to
prevent
injustice,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
now,
any
time
that
one
tries
to
channelize
the
exercise
of
discretion
in
the
myriad
of
cases,
one
runs
into
exactly
the
problem
that
you
adverted
to
earlier,
your
honor,
which
was,
well,
how
can
i
possibly
anticipate
every
variety
of
case
that's
going
to
come
before
a
court
of
appeals
over
the
next
century
or
half
century
in
this
country,
and
the
answer
is,
one
cannot.
i
assume
that
had
one
been
able
to
do
that,
that
either
congress
or
this
court
previously
would
have
done
so.
the
very
fact
that
they
have
not
done
so
and
that
they
have
left
to
the
courts
of
appeals
and,
indeed,
to
the
district
courts
of
this
country
areas
of
discretion
is
an
indication
to
me
that
not
only
is
it
impossible
to
further
cabinet,
but
it's
entirely
appropriate
that
that
discretion
be
left
there.
now,
having
said
that,
i
would
concede
to
you,
using
your
example,
that,
for
instance,
if
a
significant
period
of
time
passed,
10
or
12
years
after
the
mandate
was
issued,
the
judgment
was
issued,
a
litigant,
he
or
she
detrimentally
changed
his
or
her
position
in
reliance
on
that
judgment
and
then
the
losing
litigant
were
to
come
back
into
the
court
and
say,
eureka,
i
have
found
some
idea,
i
think
that
you
ought
to
recall
the
mandate
and
hear
this
en
banc,
perhaps
in
a
situation
like
that
discretion
would
be
exceeded.
i
would
think
that
the
courts
of
appeals
would
be
entirely
capable
of
seeing
that
that
situation
would
be
an
abuse
of
discretion.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
think
that
one
might,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
dispositive,
certainly
not
in
our
case.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
yes,
and
that,
of
course,
was
set
aside
in
1948,
as
your
honor
knows,
by
statute,
and
the
term
limit
no
longer
has
anything
to
do
with
the
ability
of
the
courts
of
appeals
to
reach
beyond
or
backward
farther
and,
of
course,
this
court
recognized
in
hazel
atlas
that
even
when
the
term
limit
was
in
place,
in
certain
circumstances,
fraud
on
the
court
or
miscarriage
of
justice,
the
court
was
free
to
ignore
the
term
limit.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
it
could
be
certainly
a
rule
of
thumb
or
a
guideline,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
well,
certainly
it
is
something
before
the
court,
so
it
may
be
something
that
the
court
may
wish
to
consider.
i
don't
think
that
it
would
affect
what
i
believe
the
proper
outcome
is
in
this
case,
for
several
reasons.
mr.
gregory
a.
long
i
don't
think
that
one
need
necessarily
view
the
facts
in
that
fashion,
justice
souter,
the
reason
being
that
it
appears
that
there
was
a
discussion
between
the
time
the
mandate
returned
to
the
circuit
and
was
sent
to
the
district
court
and
the
time
that
it
was
spread.
at
that
point
there
were
proceedings
going
on
in
the
state
court
and,
as
the
opinion
points
out,
for
reasons
of
comity,
to
use
their
word,
they
decided
to
wait
and
allow
the
state
court
to
first
address
the
issues
that
had
been
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
state
court.
it
was
entirely
possible
that
the
california
supreme
court
would
have
allowed
mr.
thompson
a
new
trial
based
upon
the
pleading
that
was
then
pending
before
them.
if
that
were
to
have
occurred,
then
the
ninth
circuit
would
not
have
made...
have
needed
to
make
public
the
rather
messy
story
that
is
now
public,
and
perhaps
that
speaks
to
protecting
the
integrity
of
the
process
as
well.
i
don't
know.
i
wasn't
privy
to
those
conversations.
what
i
do
know
is
that
they
attempted,
i
believe
in
good
faith,
to
return
us
to
the
position
in
which
we
were
before
they
made
these
errors,
and
it
was
not
just
the
error
of
two
judges
misplacing
an
e
mail,
or
two
clerks
not
speaking
to
one
another.
if,
indeed,
they
waited
too
long,
that
was
an
error,
and
in
fact
that...
the
second
call
after
the
amended
opinion
from
the
panel
issued
was
a
timely
call
under
the
rules
of
the
court,
5.4.c,
and
yet
the
entire
court
misunderstood
the
timeliness
of
that
call
and
no
vote
was
taken.
if
the
court
had
not
made
a
mistake
at
that
point,
which
may
have
been
due
partially
to
the
author
of
the
panel
opinion
and
partially
to
the
en
banc
coordinator
and
how
their
positions
were
related
to
the
judge
who
called
for
the
en
banc--
mr.
gregory
a.
long
--i
don't
think
that
was
the
trade
off,
your
honor.
i'm
merely
suggesting...
and
i
don't
know
what
the
trade
off
was,
obviously,
so
i
don't
want
to
speak
for
the
ninth
circuit.
i
couldn't.
but
let
us
assume
that
they
decided
that
they
would
give
the
court,
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
of
california,
an
opportunity
to
consider
the
claims
that
were
before
it.
if
that
court
were
to
take
one
action,
then
the
ninth
circuit
would
not
have
had
to
pursue
this
course
of
action,
as
it
did.
there
are
any
number
of
considerations
that
would
make
it
advisable
for
the
ninth
circuit
not
to
have
had
to
go
to
the
lengths
that
it
did
go
to,
which
merely
underlines
for
me
the
seriousness
with
which
they
viewed
this,
and
the
seriousness
with
which
they
viewed
their
obligation
to
correct
their
error
to
give
mr.
thompson
exactly
the
same
right
that
all
others
had
had
to
pursue.
