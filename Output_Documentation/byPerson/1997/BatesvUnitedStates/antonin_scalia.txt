justice

it
seems
to
me
that...
it
seems
to
me
the
equivalent
of
that
in
the
current
context
would
be
knowing
all
the
facts
that
renders
the...
the
action
a
misapplication.
wouldn't
that
be
the
precise
equivalent
of
what
went
on
in
morissette?
justice
antonin
scalia
and...
and
do
you
think
the...
do
you
think
the
holding
here
did
not
require
him
to
know
all
of
the
facts
that...
that
rendered
this
a
misapplication?
unless
i'm
mistaken,
you're...
you're
demanding
that
he
know
more
than
the
facts
that
rendered
a
misapplication.
you're
demanding
that
he
not
only
knew
all
those
facts,
but
that
he
also
had
some...
what
should
i
say...
criminal
motive
in
the
misapplication.
and
i
thought
that's
what
we're
fighting
about.
and
i
don't
see
that
morissette
speaks
to
that
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
words
of
morissette
are...
are
these:
a
knowing
conversion
requires
more
than
knowledge
that
the
defendant
was
taking
property
into
his
possession.
he
must
have
had
knowledge
of
the
facts,
though
not
necessarily
of
the
law,
that
made
the
taking
a
conversion.
now,
if
you
apply
that
same
text
to
the
present
case,
i
think
you'd
say...
you'd
say,
knowing
misapplication
requires
more
than
knowledge
that
he
was
applying
the
property;
he
must
have
had
knowledge
of
the
facts,
though
not
necessarily
the
law
that
made
the
application
a
misapplication.
and...
and
there's
no
quarrel
that
that's
properly
charged,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
he
knew
the
charge
was...
was
that
he
knowingly
and
willfully
misapplied.
if
i
understand
your
position,
he
knows
that
the
statute
requires
you
to
use
the
funds
for
x.
he
knowingly
and
willfully
uses
the
funds
for
y,
and,
according
to
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
knowing
that
that's
a
violation
of
the
law.
he
not
only
knows
that
he's
using
it
for
y
instead
of
x,
but
he
knows
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
you
say
that
that's
not
enough,
right?
you're
saying
he
must,
in...
in
addition
to
misapplying
it,
intend,
by
the
misapplication,
to
defraud
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
to
defraud
somebody.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
defraud...
defraud
someone.
it's
not
enough
that
he
knows
the
statute
tells
me
to
use
the
money
for
x;
i'm
going
to
use
it
for
y.
and
you
say
he
can
do
that
without
violating
this
statute
so
long
as,
in
ignoring
the
command
to
use
it
for
x,
he
was
not
trying
to
defraud
anybody.
he's
just...
he
just...
i
don't
know...
he
thought
the
statute
was
silly
or
inconsequential,
so
he
said,
i'm
not
going
to
use
it
for
x,
i'm
going
to
use
it
for
y.
and
you
say
that's
okay;
that...
that
maybe...
maybe
they
can
get
that
corrected,
but
it's
not
a
crime.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
now
you're
back
to
the
pleading
question--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
chief
justice
keeps
telling
you
is
not
in
this
case.
it's
really
not
in
this
case.
i
mean,
you've
got
to
get
back
to
tell
us
what
you...
what
it...
what
it
is.
anyway,
they
do
say
what
the
factual
thing
is.
they
say
that
it
went
to
the...
he
used
the
money
for
these
other
people.
he...
he
gave
it
to
the...
he
loaned
substantial
amounts
of
money
to
the
chief
trustee
and
a
non-related
profit-making
institution.
justice
antonin
scalia
what...
what
is
"knowingly",
then?
yeah,
that's
the...
that's
the
trouble.
because--
--it
just
repeats
"knowingly".
i
mean,
surely
"knowingly"
means
"intentionally",
you
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but,
ms.
blatt,
i'd...
i'd
really
like
to
at
least
get
a...
a
few
of
your
thoughts
on
the
issue
that
was
actually
brought
up
before
us.
and...
and
if...
if
no
one
else
thinks
it's
even
worth
talking
about,
i
do
anyway.
let's
assume...
it
seems
to
me
it...
it's...
it's
not
as
cut
and
dried
as...
as
you
make
it
out.
you...
you
have
a
list
of
words:
embezzles,
steals,
obtains
by
fraud,
false
statements
or
forgery.
and
in
the
midst
of
those
words
you
have
another
word
thrown
in
that...
that
doesn't
have
as
much
currency
in...
in
the
common
law,
"misapplies".
now,
it's
a
rudimentary
canon
of
interpretation...
it's
called
ejusdem
generis...
that
when...
when
you
have
a
general
word
that's
in
a
catalog
of
other
words,
you
give
it
the
same...
the
same
coloration
that
those
other
words
bear.
that
seems
very
extraordinary
to
me
to
find
the
word
"misapplies",
as
you
interpret
it,
just,
you
know,
well,
i
know
it
ought
to
go
in
this
account,
but,
you
know,
i'm
going
to
put
it...
what...
what's
the
difference,
you
know.
i'm
not...
i'm
not
stealing
it.
it
won't
hurt
the
government.
i'm
just
going
to
put
it
in
this
other
account.
i
know
it's
the
wrong
account,
but
i
think
it's
just
as
good,
you
know.
to
find
that
word,
as
you
interpret
it,
in
the
middle
of
these
other
ones...
embezzles,
steals,
obtains
by
fraud,
false
statement
or
forgery...
and
then,
you
know,
to
have
a...
a
1-year--a
1-year
imprisonment
for
it.
why
shouldn't
i
apply
the...
the...
the
canon
of
ejusdem
generis
and
say,
yeah,
well,
i
know,
you
know,
it's...
it's
a
strange
word,
"misapplies"...
but
if
it
said
"takes",
i
certainly
wouldn't
say,
if...
if
you...
if
you
took
it
without
any
intent
of...
of
keeping
it
or
anything
like
that,
i...
i
think
it's...
it's
very
plausible
that
you
have
to
have
some
wrongful
intent
in
the
misapplication,
other
than
you
just
know
you're
putting
it
in
the
wrong
account
number.
i
put
it
in
account
1001
instead
of
1008.
who
cares?
that's
not
embezzles,
obtains
by
fraud
and
so
forth.
