justice
stephen
g.
breyer
didn't
you
win
this?
i
mean,
i...
i'm
trying
to
put
your
argument
in
a
way
that,
to
me,
was
the
strongest.
and
maybe
you
don't
mean
it
this
way.
but...
but
there
seem
to
be
two
parts.
one,
in
the
"willfully"
part...
and
i
take
it
you
won
that...
that
the
government
is
going
to
show
that
your
client
knew
that
what
he
was
doing
was
unlawful.
didn't
you
win
that
part?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
the
government
would
have
to
show,
whatever
your
client
did,
he
knew
it
was
unlawful,
as
far
as
the
lower
opinion
goes.
then
there
seemed
to
be
a
second
part,
what
you're
calling
fraudulent
intent,
which
doesn't
have
to
do
with
the
first
part.
now,
in
reading
the
opinion,
but
not
your
brief,
i
thought
they
were...
the
words
"fraudulent
intent"
covered
two
separate
things:
intent
to
defraud,
which
isn't
involved
here
because
there
isn't
a
misrepresentation,
or
intent
to
injure.
they
worked
with
that
second
part,
"intent
to
injure
or
defraud":
intent
to
injure
the
government
or
to
defraud
the
government.
and,
of
course,
the
government
would
show
intent
to
injure,
in
that
it
would
be
the
known
consequence
of
what
your
client
allegedly
did.
he
deprived
the
government
of
the
use
of
some
money.
that
injures
the
government.
i
took
the
circuit
as
saying
the
issue
is
whether
there
has
to
be
a
specific
intent
to
injure;
i.e.,
do
they
have
to
show
that
your
client
wanted,
in
the
sense
of
purpose,
to
hurt
the
government?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
you're
going
to
tell
me
this
argument
is
not
in
the
case,
i'm
prepared
to
forget
it.
and
i
don't
want
to
make
an
argument
for
you,
but
i...
i...
i
want
to...
when
i
read
the...
not
necessarily
the
brief,
but
the
opinion
below,
i
thought
maybe
you
were
talking
about
specific
intent
to
injure
the
government.
if
you're
not,
if
you're
talking
about
specific
intent
to
defraud
the
government,
i
agree
with
justice
souter;
i
don't
see
that
it's
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
would
it
help
if
i
asked
what
do
you
think
they
should
have
added...
maybe
that
would...
in
terms
of
purpose
of
fraudulent
purpose?
what
i
read
is
that
they
say
that
mr.
bates
was
the
treasurer;
that
by
march
'89,
the
refund
liability
had
grown
to
85,000;
that
there
was
a
report
which
said
that
the
institution
of
which
he
was
the
treasurer
didn't
make
the
refund
to
the
government,
and
instead
loaned
a
lot
of
money
to
the
chief
trustee
and
other
institutions.
and
in
light
of
that,
i
take
it,
he...
they
charged
that
the
defendant
knowingly
and
willfully
mis...
misapplied
the
money,
or
some
of
that
money.
all
right.
now,
what,
in
your
opinion...
what
word
should
have
been
added
to
this
indictment
that
would
help,
from
your
point
of
view?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in...
in
paragraph
13.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
ordinary
person,
i
guess,
knows
when
he
takes
somebody
else's
money
and
uses
it
to
buy
something
that
the
other
person
doesn't
really
want
him
to
do,
that
that's
probably
a
crime...
ordinary
conversion.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and,
all
right,
what
about
the
40,000
pages
of...
of
rules
that
govern,
in
detail,
how
one
is
supposed
to
apply
federal
money;
anyone
who
violates
any
one
of
those
rules
is...
is
guilty
of
a
crime?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
that...
that
you
have
a
university
where
you're
a
financial
officer
and
you
are
dealing
with
lots
of
money.
and
there
are
probably
rules
that
are...
fill
dozens
of
manuals.
and
you
perhaps
know
them.
and
one
day
you
say,
my
goodness,
i'm
going
to
pay
the
grounds
men
and
not
the
professors
for
a
week.
and
the
reason
you're
doing
it
is
there's
some
kind
of
odd
shortage
and
they're
poorer,
so
you
want
to
pay
them.
is
it
against
the
manual
rule?
yes.
you
know
it.
you'd
never
think
it
was
a
crime.
now,
on
your
interpretation
of
the
law,
they're
guilty.
very
well.
on
that
interpretation
of
the
law,
looking
at
your
statement
of
the
question,
which
you
thought
was
a
rephrasing
of
his
statement,
why
wouldn't
you
read
the
statute
that
there
would
not
only
have
to
be
knowledge
that
your
conduct
was
injuring
the
government,
but
that
you
would
have
to
want
to
injure
the
government;
i.e.,
you'd
have
to
have
a
specific
intent
to
injure
the
government
before
you
would
be
guilty
under
such
circumstances
of
a
felony?
now,
that's...
that's
taking
your...
i
don't
know
that
i
agree
with
your
interpretation--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
assuming
that
i
did
agree
with
your
interpretation
of
1
of
5,000
accounting
manuals
that
are
in
a
university,
shouldn't
that
person
at
least
have
to
want
to
hurt
the
government,
rather
than
just
knowing
that
the
government
will
be
deprived
of
10
minutes
use
of
some
funds
that
he
put
in
a
different
account?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
view,
then,
is
what
congress
intended
is
to
take
any
person
in
a
university
educational
institution
anywhere,
and
all
they
do
is
have
to
know
that
somebody
in
the
organization
told
them,
put
the
money
over
here
rather
than
there,
they're
guilty
of
a
felony?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
underlying
conversion,
according
to
you,
is
to
take
some
government
funds
and
use
them
in
any
manner,
for
however
short
a
period
of
time,
contrary
to
what
your
boss
told
you
should
be
done--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
the
regulation
supports
the
boss?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
the
use
told
about
was
not
necessarily
your
personal
desire.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
desired
to
put
it
in
account
a
rather
than
account
b.
it
may--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
suggests
that
something
is
wrong
somewhere.
yeah--
