we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
96-7185,
garrit
bates
against
the
united
states.
mr.
oren.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you...
you
say
strictly
examine,
mr.
oren,
are
you
suggesting
some
extremely
skeptical
scrutiny
of
the
language
of
an
indictment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
here
you're
saying
all
we
have
to
look
at
is
the
indictment
and
nothing
more
than
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
now...
now,
mr....
mr.
oren,
the
question
presented
here
in
the
petition
for
certiorari
is
whether
intent
to
injure
or
defraud
the
government
is
an
element
of
the
offense
of
knowingly
and
willingly...
willfully
misapplying
federal
student
loan
funds,
in
violation
of
the
statutory
section.
and
i...
i
think
the...
the
government
apparently
agrees
that
the
indictment
does
not
contain
any
allegation
that
it
was
done
with
an
intent
to
injure
or
defraud
the
united
states.
so
the
question
we
have
before
us,
as
i
would
understand
it,
is:
is
that
an
element
of...
of
the
offense?
and
i
don't
see
why
we
need
to
be
concerned
with
the
various
detailed
allegations
of
the
indictment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
we're...
we're
not
canvassing
the
indictment
for
some
shortcoming.
it's
a
very
precise
issues
that's...
that
you
have
presented
in
the
question
for
certiorari.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mor...
morissette
was
a
statute
which
didn't
contain
any
requirement
of
intent,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what
are
the
allegations
as
to
bates'
conduct
were
sufficient
to
state
an
offense?
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
district
court
dismissed
the
indictment
and
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court.
and
that's
not
presented
in
your
question
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're...
you're
limited,
mr.
oren,
to...
to
the
question
presented
here.
and
the
question
presented
in
your
petition
is
whether
intent
to
injure
or
defraud
the
government
is
an
element
of
the
offense
of
knowingly
and
willfully
misapplying
federal
student
loan
funds,
in
violation
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but,
now,
it
does
allege
that
he
did
knowingly
and
willfully
misapply;
there's
no
doubt
about
that,
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that...
that's
not
the
question
you've
brought
here.
the...
you
know,
i
don't
want
to
repeat
it
again.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
granted
certiorari
on
a
particular
question,
and
it's
not
that
one.
do
you
understand
what
i
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
didn't
cross-petition
here,
did
it?
that's
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
we
really
don't
have
to
decide--
--right.
--whether
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
what
it
said?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
suppose,
under
justice
breyer's
hypothetical
construction,
it
would
be
a
defense
for
a
person
to
say,
i
knew
i
was
taking
$40,000
of
the
government's
money,
but
i
didn't
intend
to
hurt
them;
they
have
millions
back
in
washington?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
blatt.
the
case
is
submitted.
