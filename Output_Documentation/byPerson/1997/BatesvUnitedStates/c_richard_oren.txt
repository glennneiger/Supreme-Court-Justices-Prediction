mr.
c.
richard
oren
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
comes
before
you
today
as
a
result
of
the
dismissal
of
an
indictment
by
the
district
court
in
the
northern
district
of
indiana
in
april
of
1995,
prior
to
the
taking
of
any
evidence
in
the
case.
however,
the
challenge
to
the
sufficiency
of
the...
of
the
indictment
actually
began
many
months
prior
to
that
in
an
official
conference
i
had
with
mr.
bates
in
my
office.
at
that
time
we
went
over
the
indictment
paragraph
by
paragraph.
at
the
end
of
that
process,
mr.
bates
thought
for
a
minute;
he
looked
at
me,
and
he
said:
yes,
but
what
is
it
they're
telling
me
i
did
wrong?
and
i
said:
well,
mr.
bates,
i
believe
that
they're
saying
that
you
misapplied
federal
student
loan
funds.
mr.
bates
thought
about
that
for
a
minute
and
then
he
said
to
me:
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
what
is
it
specifically
they're
saying
i
did
that
was
illegal?
and
i
went
back
and
i
looked
at
the
indictment
and
i
found
that
i
could
not
really
answer
that
question
for
him.
i
believe
that
exchange
underscores
the
importance
of
this
court's
standard
for
judging
the
sufficiency
of
an
indictment.
that
being
that
all
elements
of
the
offense
charged
must
be
stated
and
that
the
indictment
should
fairly
inform
the
defendant
of
the
charges
against
him,
as
well
as
be
sufficiently
specific
to
stand
as
a
bar
to
further
prosecutions
should
there
be
a
conviction
or
an
acquittal.
so
what
i'm
asking
of
this
court
is
to
strictly
examine
the
indictment
that
was
brought
before
mr.
bates...
that
was
brought
against
mr.
bates.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
no,
not
extremely
skeptical,
your
honor.
i...
i
believe
i'm
using
that
in
the
sense
that
prior
to
evidence
being
taken,
the
only
thing
we
have
to
look
at
is
the
indictment.
if...
if
there
was
dismissal
after
evidence
had
been
taken,
then
i
think
that
if
there
was
no
prejudice
shown,
then
if
the
indictment
was
not
sufficient,
it
would
still
not
really--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--that's...
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
the
indictment
here
is
set
forth
in
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
2
through
12.
it
is
actually
structured
in
two
portions.
the
first
portion
is
a
series
of
basic
background
factual
allegations.
and
the
second
portion
are
12
specific
charging
counts,
if
you
will.
directing
the
court's
attention
to
the
first,
the
factual
allegations,
it
provides,
first
of
all,
various
background
information
and
then
some
specific
allegations
of
conduct
against
mr.
bates...
or
by
mr.
bates.
as
a
background
information,
it...
it
alleges
that
a
james
and
laurenda
jackson
owned
the
ax...
acme
institute
of
technology.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
my
reasoning
for
bringing
this
to
the
court's
attention
is
that
the...
again,
the
sufficiency
of
the
indictment
depends,
i
believe,
on
the
actual
setting
forth
of
the
elements
of
the
offense
in
the
indictment.
and--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--yes,
all
right.
assuming,
then,
that
the
government
is
agreeing
that
there
is
no
factual
allegations
alleging...
of
the
elements
of
the...
of
the
offense,
as
we
believe
it
to
be--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--no,
there
is
not.
it
is
my
understanding
that,
at
least
in
the
courts
below,
the
government
has
agreed
that
conversion,
or
un...
unauthorized
use
of
property
to
the
benefit
of
the
defendant
or
a
third
party,
is
an
element
of
the
offense.
but
where
there
is
no
agreement
between
the
government
and
mr.
bates
is
that...
whether
or
not
fraudulent
intent
or
criminal
intent
is
an
element
of
the
offense
of
knowingly
and
willfully
misapplying
student
loan
funds.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
well,
this
does
present
an
issue
of
statutory
construction,
justice
ginsburg.
i
believe
that
there
are
four
principles
that...
of
statutory
construction
that
would
support
this
reading.
the
first
of
that
is...
the
first
principle
would
be
the
actual
language
of
the
statute
itself.
i
believe
there
are
indications
in
there
that...
of
the
scienter
element.
that
being
the
words
of
the
term
"knowingly
and
willfully",
as
modifying
"misapplies".
mr.
c.
richard
oren
yes.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
that...
that
is
correct.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
am
using
the
term
"fraudulent
intent",
i
believe,
as
synonymous
with
or
indicative
of
what
would
be
called
specific
intent
of
the
common
law
or
illegal
purpose.
i
think
fraudulent
intent
is
actually
very
descriptive
of
specific
intent
when
it
comes
to
the
use
or
misuse
of
money.
so
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
fraudulent
intent
is
specific
intent
or
illegal
purpose,
and
that
that
is
in
fact
an
element
of
the
offense
of
misapplication
of
funds.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
the
seventh
circuit,
in
my
estimation,
issued
an
opinion
which
was
slightly
confusing.
because,
in
one
part,
they
did
refer
to
the
burden
of
the
united
states
to
actually
prove
some
knowledge
of
wrongdoing.
yet,
on
the
other
hand,
they
said
that
the
offense
of
willful...
of
willful...
knowingly
and
willfully
misapplying
funds
did
not
include
the...
the
element
of
fraudulent
intent.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
yes.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
would...
i...
i
guess,
rely
on
the
morissette
case,
where
the...
this
court
held
that
a
knowing
conversion
of
government
property
included
a
criminal
intent,
which
would
require
the
government
to
show
that
the
defendant,
morissette,
had
knowledge
of
all
the
facts,
which
would
have
made
his
conduct
a
conversion.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
holding
is
exactly
what
was
being
stated
by
the
seventh
circuit.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
yes.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
believe
that
morissette
speaks
to
this
issue
in
this
way.
morissette
referred
to
a
species...
or
it
referred
to
every
stealing
being
a
conversion,
yet
not
every
conversion
being
a
stealing.
what
morissette,
i
believe,
was
doing
was
distinguishing
between
the
tort
of
conversion
as
opposed
to
a
criminal
conversion.
and
in...
in...
again,
in
morissette,
they
referred
to
a
type
of
conversion
which
could
occur
when
the
property
first
came
into
possession
of
the
defendant
in
a
lawful
manner,
but
was
later
misused.
and
i
believe
that
that
type
of
conversion,
that
species
of
conversion,
is
exactly
what
misapplication
is.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
believe
that
it
stated
the
modifying
term
of
"knowing
conversion"
in...
in
the
statute.
to
that
extent,
it...
it
did
indicate
that
there
was
an
element
of
tent...
of
intent
present.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
no.
that...
i...
i
believe
that
would
be
a
proper
statement
as
to
the
offense
of
misapplication.
and
i
don't
believe
that
i
was
trying
to
suggest
anything
more
than
that
in
my
use
of
the
term
"fraudulent
intent".
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
really
do
not
know
how
to
answer
that.
i
did
not
read
the...
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
in
that...
in
that
manner.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
believe
that,
first
of
all,
they're
talking
about
two
separate
types
of
actions
in
(a)
and
in...
and
in
(d).
i
think
the...
and
in
subsection
(d),
they're
talking
about
destroying
or
concealing
property
with
fraudulent
intent.
in
those
words,
in
normal
usage,
would
not
be...
destroying
and
concealing
property
would
not
ordinarily
have
a
criminal
consequence.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
believe
perhaps
we
did,
yes.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
yes.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
right.
i
believe
i
was
using
the
term
"fraudulent
intent"
to
refer
to
specific
intent
and
illegal
purpose.
as
that
relates
to
this
indictment,
i
do
not
believe
that
the
seventh
circuit
opinion
would
have
provided
us
with
any
greater
information
about
what
use
the
government
was
alleging
was
the
problem
with
mr.
bates'
conduct.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
no,
i
do
not.
i
do
not
agree
with
that.
i
do
not
believe
that
the
indictment
states
facts
that
show
a
misapplication,
nor--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--the
indictment
does
not
state
any
factual
allegation
of
any
use
of
the
funds
by
mr.
bates.
it
does...
it
states,
i
believe--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--yes.
but--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--the
allegation
is
not
in
the
indictment
that
mr.
bates
did
anything
with
the
funds.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
the
argument
that
i
have
presented
consistently
from
the
district
court's
opinion
was
that
there
were
no
factual
allegations
setting
forth
the
elements
of
the
offense.
and
if
you
look
at
the--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--yes.
yes.
i
agree
that
is
the
question
presented.
the
reason
we
got
to
that
point
as
being
the
question
presented
is
because
there
was
nothing
in
the
factual
allegations
to
suggest
the
elements
of
the
crime.
and
if
you
look
at
the
actual
charging
counts,
it
states
the
words
of
the
statute.
and
it's
our
position
that
the
term
"misapplies"
is
intrinsically
vague.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
and--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--that's...
that's
correct.
but
it
is
intrinsically
vague.
thus,
i
believe
that
to
meet
the
standards
of
actually
setting
forth
the
elements,
the...
the
indictment
should
have
stated
at
least
the
conceptual
elements
of
the--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--yes.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
yes.
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
well,
i
think,
at
the
very
least,
that
the...
the
indictment
should
have
stated
that
it...
that
the
defendant
did
knowingly
and
willfully
misapply
funds,
in
a
certain
amount,
by
converting
those
funds
to
his
use,
with--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--by
converting
those
funds
to
his
use,
or
the
use
of
a
third
party,
with
intent
to
defraud.
that,
i
believe,
would
have
made
this
indictment
barely
sufficient,
so
that
mr.
bates
would
have
at
least
known
the
essence
of
the
charges
against
him.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
really
did
not
intend
for
the...
i...
fraudulent
intent...
i
did
not
mean
to
convey
the
thought
that...
that
fraudulent
intent
was
specific
as
against
the
united
states.
that,
i
believe,
was
the--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--to
defraud
someone.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
i
believe
my
point
was
that
we
are
not
informed
of
what
the
factual
misuse
is.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
right.
yes.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
in
which
paragraph
of
the
indictment?
mr.
c.
richard
oren
that
statement,
or
allegation,
does
not
say
anything
about
mr.
bates'
conduct.
they...
there
are
a
lot
of
allegations
in
this
about
other
people;
that
doesn't
inform
us
about
mr.
bates'
conduct.
and
the
reason
that
i
have
used
the
term
"fraudulent
intent"
is
that
i
was
using
it
in
the
sense
that
it
was
used...
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
specific
intent,
an
illegal
purpose,
to
distinguish
the
same
type
of...
of
behavior
in
a
misapplication
scenario,
as
was
distinguished
in
morissette,
a...
the
tort
of
conversion
from
the
crime
of
conversion.
i
believe
this
is
just
a
subset
of
that,
and
that,
at
the
very
least,
that
element
of
fraudulent
intent
should
have
been
set
forth
in
the
indictment,
inasmuch
as
that
would
have--
mr.
c.
richard
oren
--yes,
it
does.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
yes.
mr.
c.
richard
oren
thank
you.
