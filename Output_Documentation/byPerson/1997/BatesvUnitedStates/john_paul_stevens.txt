john
paul

well,
it
really
boils
down
to
what
does
the
word
"misapply"
or
"misapplication"
mean.
they
said
"knowingly
misapply",
and
you
say,
when
you
say
"misapply",
it
includes
a
lot
of
other
stuff
other
than
doing
the
wrong
type
of
thing
with
the
funds...
knowing
what
the
right
thing
was.
but
this
all
turns
on
what
the
word
"misapply"
means,
doesn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
read
a
lot
into
it;
they
read
very
little
into
it.
they
wouldn't
even
read
the...
as
i
read
their
brief,
they
wouldn't
even
require
you
to
know
that
it
was
a
misapplication.
all
you
have
to
know
is
what
you
did
with
it.
which
seems
a
little
extreme
to
me.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
thank
you,
mr.
oren.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
when
you--
--excuse
me.
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you...
but
you...
you
do
seem
to
say
that
he
had
to
know
that
it
was
unauthorized.
so
he
has
to
have
some
knowledge
of
the
duty,
some
knowledge
of
what
his
duties
were.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
he
not,
un...
under
your
view,
have
to
know
that
there
were
regulations
out
there
that
required
him
to
use
the
funds
in
one
way
rather
than
another?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
do
you
mean
by
requisite
criminal
intent?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
what
reason
should
it
have
been
re...
just
have
some
general
hunch
it
should
have
been
returned
or
must
he
know
why
it
should
have
been
returned?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you...
do
you
understand
this
indictment
to
require
the
prosecutor
in
this
case
to
prove
that
this
defendant
knew
that
there
were
regulations
that
he'd
violated?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
also
said
with
criminal
intent...
he
could
have
criminal
intent
even
if
he
did
not
know
that
the
regulations
prohibited
what
he
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
only
thing
that
prohibited
the
conduct
was
the
regulations.
that's
the...
that's
the
source
of
his
duty
to
do
something
else.
and
you
say
he
does
not
have
to
know...
he
has
to
know
the
duty.
how
could
he
know
the
duty
without
knowing
what
the
regulations
require?
i
don't
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but...
but
it
didn't
in
this
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we're
trying
a
particular
case
in
which
it...
there
was
a
misapplication,
because
what
he
did,
did
not
conform
to
some
regulations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
agree
you
must
prove
that
he
knew
what
he
did
was
wrongful.
and
the
only
reason
it
would
be
wrongful
was
that
he
didn't
comply
with
the
regulations.
but
you
say
you
don't
have
to
prove
he...
he
knew
he
was
not
complying
with
the
regulations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
your
position
is
inconsistent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
then,
you
are...
are
agreeing
that
in
this
case
you
must
prove
that
he
knew
he
was
violating
the
regulations?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
how
else
could
you
prove
a
knowing
misapplication
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
because
you
would
have
proved
that
he
knew
that
the
regulations
required
it.
his
knowledge
may
have
come
through
an
oral
conversation;
he
doesn't
have
to
read
the
regulation.
but
i...
i
do
think
you
either
have
to
agree
that
you
have
to
prove
that
he
knew
he
was
violating
a
government
command
or
you
don't
have
to
prove
it.
and
i
think
you've
admitted
you
do
have
to
prove
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
other
way
could
you
prove
know...
knowing
misapplication
in
this
particular
factual
context?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
that
would
be
a
crime
even
if
the
government
regulations
didn't
require
it?
