justice
david
h.
souter
and
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
"knowingly
and
willfully"
somehow
incorporates
a
fraudulent
intent,
even
though
the
statute
otherwise,
in
describing
not
merely
the...
in
describing
not
the...
the...
the
offense
of
misapplication,
but
a
different
kind
of
offense,
of
obtaining,
refers
expressly
to
fraud
as
one
forbidden
means
of
obtaining
property.
and...
and
isn't
that
the
nub
of
your
problem?
the
statute
refers
to
fraud
elsewhere,
but
you
want
us
to
import
the
concept
of
fraud
into...
into
a
term
which,
on
its
face,
has
no
apparent
reference
to
fraud?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
leaving
aside
whether
you
are
entitled
to
or
not,
didn't
you
get...
didn't
the
seventh
circuit
take
the
position
that
the
government
would
have
to
prove...
under
the...
the
concept
of
"willfully",
that
the
government
would
have
to
prove
that
the
misapplication
was
made
with
an
understanding
of...
of...
of...
that
it
violated
the
law?
wasn't
that
the
seventh
circuit's
definition
of
"willfully"?
justice
david
h.
souter
yeah,
but
fraudulent
intent,
as
we
normally
use
the
term,
is
something
different
from
an
intent
to
misuse
property
with
knowledge
that
the
misuse
is
in
fact
forbidden
by
a
federal
statute.
those
are
two
different
concepts.
and
i
don't
see
any
inconsistency
between
those
two
aspects
of
the
circuit
opinion.
why
are
they
inconsistent?
to
obtain
by
fraud,
as
we
normally
mean
it,
is
to...
is
to
make
a...
a
misrepresation...
misrepresentation
of
fact
to
someone
as
a
means
of
getting
that
person's
property.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
something
entirely
distinct
from
committing
an
act,
whatever
the
act
may
be,
with
the
knowledge
that
there
is
a
statute
that
forbids
the
act.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that's
the...
that's
the
distinction,
certainly,
inherent
in
the
seventh
circuit
opinion.
and
i
don't
see
why
it's
a
distinction
that
isn't
a
perfectly
valid
one.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the...
the
seventh
circuit
would
give
you
even
more
than
justice
scalia
just
suggested
that
you
were
entitled
to.
under
the
seventh
circuit
opinion,
you
would...
you
would
be
entitled
to
an
instruction
that
the
government
had
to
prove
that
you
knew
you
were
violate...
your
client
knew
that
he
was
violating
the
law.
so
you're
getting
more,
in
fact,
than...
than...
on
your...
on
your
own
theory,
morissette
would
give
you.
justice
david
h.
souter
ms.
blatt,
let
me...
let
me
just
raise
the
difficulty
that
i
have
with...
with
the
government's
position
that
the...
the
source
of
the
prohibition
need
not
be
shown;
that
the
knowledge
of
specific
illegality
need
not
be
shown.
the
mens
rea
requirement
is
knowingly
and
willingly.
willfully.
and
if...
if
we
exclude
from
the
possible
meaning
of
"willingly"
this
intent
to
defraud...
and
i...
i
will
so
assume,
what's
left
for
the
meaning
of
"willingly"
as...
or
"willfully"...
i'm
sorry...
as
something
in
addition
to
"knowingly"?
the...
the
circuit,
i
thought,
made
a
pretty
good...
good
guess
at
it.
and
i
realize
that
our
prior
cases
that
have
construed
it
that
way
have
been
tax
cases,
but
what
else
could
it
plausibly
mean?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
you
could
have
a
knowing
act
that
is
not
purposeful,
in
the
sense
that
the
model
penal
code
makes
the
distinction.
but
how
can
you
have
a
knowing
act
that
is
not
deliberate?
