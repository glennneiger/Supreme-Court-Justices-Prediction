well,
it
doesn't
say
it's...
here's
the
statute,
1097(a)...
it
doesn't
say
"with
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states.
"
why
should
we
read
that
into
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
he
was
charged
with
that...
several
counts
of
knowingly
and
willfully
misapplying
federal
money,
was
he
not?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
was
the
language
used.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
what
do
you
do
with
the...
the
1097(d),
which
states,
in
so
many
words,
that
there
must
be
an
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states,
with
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states?
that
very
language
in
the
same
section,
in
(d),
is
omitted
from
(a).
so
if
it's
in
(d)
and
it's
not
in
(a),
wouldn't
one
infer
that
congress
didn't
mean
it
to
be
read
into
(a)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
by
what?
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear.

this
case
concerns
20
u.s.c.
section
1097(a)
which
declares
it
a
felony
to
misapply
federally
insured
student
loan
funds,
knowing
and
willfully.
the
question
presented
is
whether
section
1097(a)
demanded
allegation
and
proof
that
the
defendant
specifically
intented
to
defraud
someone,
either
the
united
states
as
loan
guarantor
or
another.
we
hold
that
the
government
need
not
prove
that
the
defendant
had
an
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states
or
another
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
seventh
circuit.
the
federally
insured
student
loan
program
involved
in
this
case
works
as
follows:
banks
lend
money
to
students
pursuing
post
secondary
education.
the
lenders
send
checks
covering
tuition
directly
to
the
educational
institution
which
credits
the
bank's
loan
against
the
student's
tuition
debt.
the
government
guarantees
payment
of
the
loan
to
the
students
default,
if
the
student
withdraws
before
the
end
of
the
term,
the
school
must
return
to
the
bank
the
unused
portion
of
the
loan,
if
the
school
does
not
return
the
money,
the
student
and
if
she
default,
the
government
will
be
obligated
to
repay
the
loan.
defendant
bates
was
the
chief
financial
officer
of
the
school
that
received
federally
insured
loans
according
to
the
indictment,
bates
repeatedly
diverted
unused
loan
funds
to
the
school's
owners
instead
of
making
refunds
to
the
bank.
for
this
alleged
conduct,
he
was
charged
with
12
violations
of
1097(a),
the
indictment
alleged
that
bates
knowingly
and
willfully
misapplied
student's
loan
funds
but
they
it
did
not
alleged
in
addition
that
he
acted
with
an
intent
to
injure
or
defraud
the
united
states.
the
district
court
held
that
misapplication
on
the
section
1097(a)
required
such
an
allegation
and
therefore
dismiss
the
indictment.
the
seventh
circuit
reversed.
in
conflict
with
the
eleventh
circuit,
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
intent
to
defraud
is
not
an
element
of
the
crime
defined
in
section
1097(a).
our
decision
today
dissolves
that
conflict.
the
word
"intent
to
defraud"
to
not
appear
in
the
text
of
section
1097(a)
but
they
do
appear
in
the
text
of
a
neighboring
provision
20
u.s.c.
1097(d)
passed
at
the
same
time
as
section
1097(a).
this
court
has
said
in
similar
context
when
congress
includes
language
in
one
section
and
omits
it
from
a
closely
place
section
of
the
same
statute
courts
should
not
add
what
congress
omitted.
bates
emphasized
is
that
another
statute
18
u.s.c.
section
656
which
prohibits
the
willful
misapplication
of
bank
funds,
similarly
does
not
now
contain
an
intent
to
defraud
requirement
but
that
statute,
as
originally
written,
did
contain
such
as
requirement,
the
requirement
was
dropped
out
during
the
technical
revision
of
the
criminal
code.
courts
have
continued
to
read
and
intent
to
defraud
requirement
into
section
656,
concerned
that
without
it
even
unauthorized
loan,
every
an
authorized
loan
by
a
bank
officer
might
be
turned
into
a
federal
offense.
we
assume,
without
deciding,
that
section
656
is
correctly
read
to
retain
an
intent
to
defraud
element
but
section
1097(a)
is
differently
situated,
section
1097(a)
never
contained
an
intent
to
defraud
a
requirement
and
there
is
no
risk
under
the
seventh
circuit's
contraction
that
near
maladministration
or
unwise
use
of
funds
would
fall
within
section
1097(a)'s
compass.
the
decision
affirming
the
seventh
circuit's
judgment
is
unanimous.
