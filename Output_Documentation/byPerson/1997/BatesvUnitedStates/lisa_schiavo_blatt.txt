mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
decision
below
is
correct,
because
both
the
text
and
structure
of
section
1097
compel
the
conclusion
that
an
intent
to
injure
or
defraud
is
not
an
element
of
the
misapplication
offense.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no...
i
mean,
yes,
we
disagree.
in
our
view,
the
word...
all
that's
required
is
that
the
defendant
know
that
his
use
of
the
money
is
unauthorized.
the
defendant
does
not
also
have
to
know
the
source
of
the
prohibition
or
that
using
the
money
in
an...
in
an
unauthorized
manner
was
a
violation
of
the
law.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the
court
said
in
united
states
v.
britton,
in
1883,
that
misapplication
was
not
a
technical
or
a
word
at
common
law;
it
was
a
word
created
by
statute.
and
in
that
case,
the
court
gave
it
a
definition
of
misapplication
to
one's
use
or
the
use
of
another
of
someone
else's
funds.
and
that
meant
it
was
a
conversion.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
i...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
i
don't.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
we
think
here
it
means
what
it
means
in
almost
every
case.
and
that
is
"deliberately".
which
is...
which
is
how
the
court
construed
the
words
v.
browder.
and
the...
and
so
the
common
understanding
of
the
word
"willfully"
is
intentionally.
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--sure.
let...
let
me
address
that
in...
in
several
parts.
this
court,
in
morissette,
said...
used
the
words,
both
"intentional"
and
"knowing".
and
you
could
certainly
have
a
knowing
act
that's
not
deliberate.
i
agree
that
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
have
a
deliberate
act
that's--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--i...
i
push
you
into
someone
and
you
knowingly
hit
that
person,
but
you're
not
deliberately
hitting
that
person.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right,
it's
not
vol...
right--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
in
our
view,
the
word
"willfully"
means
voluntary,
deliberately,
in
the
sense
that
the
act
is...
is
done
voluntarily.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
which
is,
again,
i
think,
the
way
the
court
construed
it
in
browder.
but
let
me
make
one
other
point.
if
you
construe
the
word
"willfully"
to
mean
a
voluntary,
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty,
as
in
pomponio,
i...
i
still
think
you
have
the
same
problem
with
the
word
"knowing".
because
it's
hard
to
have
an
unknowing,
intentional
violation
of
a
known
legal
duty.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
exactly
correct.
we
just
wanted
you
to
know
our
view.
and...
and,
in
our
view,
the
words
"willfully
and
knowingly"
would
just
require
that
the
defendant
know
that
his
use
of
the
funds
was
unauthorized.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
yes,
the
defendant
must
know
that
the
money
in...
in
this
case
belonged
to
the...
the
lender
after
the
student
withdrew.
he
did
not
have
to
know
that
the
source
of
the...
of
the
prohibition
of
holding
on
to
the
money
when
it
belonged
to
someone
else.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no,
not
in
the
sense
of
specific
regulations.
no.
it
so
happens
in
this
case
that
it
is
alleged
that
the
defendant
was
familiar
with
the
department
of
education's
regulations.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that's
correct.
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
well,
he'd
have
to
have
some
other
way
of
knowing
that
the
use
was
unauthorized,
such
as
the
school's
manual
required
the
refunds
back
to
the
lender
in
order
to
reduce
the
student's
debt.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
there's
a
felony
if
you
knowingly
and
intentionally
convert
money
when
you
know
the
money
truly
belonged
to
someone
else.
and
that's
a...
it's
definitely...
it's
a
property
crime.
it's
the
crime
of
conversion.
and
all
we're
saying
here
is
that
the
defendant's
acts
must
be
deliberate
and
the
defendant
must
know
that
this
money
belongs
to
someone
else.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
and
what
this--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
i
mean,
there
would
have
to
be
two
things.
there'd
have
to
be
the
requisite
criminal
intent,
and
there...
there
would
also
have
to
be
the
conduct
of
the
conversion.
and
just
a...
a
technical
violation
of
the
rule...
for
instance,
if
the
defendant
miscalculated
the
amount
of
the
refund,
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
regulation,
but
you
wouldn't
have
the
requisite
criminal
intent.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
that
the
defendant...
that
his
conduct
be
deliberate,
and
the
defendant
know
that
the
money
should
have
been
returned.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
in
this
case,
and
in
most
cases,
the
source
of
the
knowledge
is
going
to
be
the
law,
because
it
will
be
the
department
of
education's
regulations.
our
point
is
that
the
word
"willfully"
does
not
have
this
meaning
of
requiring
knowledge
of
illegality.
which
is
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
construed
it.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
the
indictment
just
said
he
had
to
act
willfully.
which,
again,
in
our
view,
would
mean
he
had
to
act
deliberately.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
as
long
as
he
has
another...
some
knowledge
that
his
conduct
was
prohibited.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
he
could
have...
the
source
of
the
duty
could
not
only
come
from
the
school's
manual,
it
could
come
from
his
boss--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
in
this--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--in
this
case,
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
proof
would
come,
and
the
indictment
does
allege,
that
the
defendant
knew
of
the
legal
requirement
to
pay
refunds.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no;
i'm
saying
in
this
case
we
can
prove
that.
i'm
not
saying
that
we
must
prove
it.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
oh,
in
this
case,
if
the
defendant
had
read
the
manual
or
if
the
defendant
had
a
discussion
with
the
financial
aid
director
and
the
financial
aid
director
said
the
department
of
education
requires
this.
he
would
understand
that
okay,
this
money
needs
to
go
to
a
lender.
and
he's
intentionally
engaging
in
a
wrongful
act
by
holding
on
to
it.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no;
i...
i've
admitted
we
can
prove
it.
i
don't
think
we
do
have
to
prove
it.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
if
the
school's
manual
set
forth...
which,
in
this
case,
it
did...
the
duty
to
return
money
after
a
student's
withdrawal.
you
could
also
have
a
situation
where
the
person--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
that
wouldn't
be
a
crime...
not
because
of
the
intent,
you
just
wouldn't
have
the
crime
of
conversion.
if
the
money
is
in
fact
not
used
consistent
with
its
authorized
purposes,
you
would
not
have
a
crime
to
begin
with.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
justice
scalia,
we
interpret
the
word
"misapply"
to
mean
convert.
which
is...
in
morissette,
this
court
construed,
in...
in
connection
with
similar
words,
such
as
"stealing"
and
"embezzlement".
and
the
court
said
that
there
are
distinctions
between
those
terms.
and
there's
nothing
innocent
about
using
property
in
a
way
you're
not
supposed
to
use
it.
and...
and...
and
as
long
as
you
are
performing
an
act
that's
deliberate
and
you
know
that
you're
use
is
unauthorized,
it
should
be
a
crime.
you
don't
separately
need
to
prove
fraudulent
or
injurious
intent.
and,
again,
not
only
do
we
have
the...
the
text
of
the
statute,
where
fraud
is
separately
prohibited,
but
we
have
the
words
"with
intent
to
defraud
the
united
states.
"
in...
in
subsection
1097
(d).
and
it's...
it's
those
textual
features
and
structural
features
that
make
it
clear
that
an
intent
to
defraud
or
an
intent
to
injure
is
not
an
element
of
the
misapplication--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
we
do
not
think
an
intent
to
injure
is
required.
and
even
under
the
common
understanding
of
conversion
and
embezzlement,
the
law
is
quite
well...
well
settled
that
an
intent
to
replace
the
money
is
not
a
defense.
so
you
could
take
your
employer's
money--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
you
still
have
to
have
the
underlying
conversion.
and
in
the
example
you
gave,
i
don't--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
and...
and--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no.
and
of
course
you
have
to
convert
it
to
your
own
use
or
the
use
of
another.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
well,
it
still
has
to
be
for
either
your
use
or
the
use
of
a
third
party.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
right.
and
it's...
it's
not
a
defense
to--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--no--
[laughter]
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
no.
you
can't...
i
mean,
it
is...
really,
it
is
quite
well
settled
that
it's
not
a
defense
to
either
embezzlement
or
conversion
to
take
money,
hoping
that
the
person
is
not
hurt
because
you're
going
to
give
it
back.
and
here,
the
school
cannot
defend
on
the
argument
that,
well,
we
didn't
intend
to
hurt
the
government,
because
these
students
are
ultimately
going
to
repay
the
loan;
the
government
is
not
going
to
be
hurt.
or
we
intended
to
pay
the
refund
some
day.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
the...
the
crime
here,
justice
kennedy,
is...
is
on
the
failure
to
refund
on
the
60th
day.
and
so
the...
how
they
spend
the
money
up
until
the
student
withdrawal
and
the
amount--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--oh,
if...
if
they
can't...
if
it's...
if
they...
if
it's
not
a
voluntary
act,
because
someone
stole
the
money--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--with
the
requisite
intent.
and
that
would
have
to
be
both
a
voluntary
act
and
a
knowing
act.
and
if
someone
stole
other
monies--
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
--well,
the
distinction,
again...
and
i
think
the
words
"knowingly
and
willfully"
would
take
care
of
that
and
you
wouldn't,
in
any
event,
need
to
read
intent
to
defraud
into
the
statute...
but
the
issue
would
turn
on
whether
the
act
is
voluntary
and
knowing
or
if,
for
some
reason,
it
was
beyond
the
defendant's
control.
and...
but
that
would
be
the...
the
guiding
principles.
and
if
a
defendant
is
intentionally
spending
this
money
that's
not
theirs
and
that's
not
earned
until
the
student
finishes
the
term,
and
doesn't
pay
the
refund
obligation,
knowing
the
money
has
got
to
go
back
to
the
lender
within
60
days,
you
have
a
misapplication
of
title
iv
funds.
ms.
lisa
schiavo
blatt
they
should
not
have
been
spending
unearned
money.
and
if
they're
intentionally
spending
that
unearned
money...
and...
and
these
schools
are
fiduciaries
with
respect
to
this
money
as
well...
if
they
do
not
organize
their
affairs,
or
intentionally
organize
their
affairs
such
that
money
is
not
available
and
students
withdraw,
in
our
view,
the
statute
would
cover
it.
but...
but...
but,
again,
i
mean,
the
issue
is
whether
an
intent
to
defraud
or
injure
would
be
required,
when
there's
nothing
in
the
text
or
the
history
or
the
structure
of
the
statute
to
suggest
that
it
should
be
read
into
it.
i
don't...
in
conclusion,
if
there
are
no
questions.
