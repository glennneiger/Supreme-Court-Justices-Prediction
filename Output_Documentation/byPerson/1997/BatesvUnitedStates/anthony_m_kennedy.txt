justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that,
if
all
of
the
facts
in
the
indictment
are
established,
that
there
was
a
misapplication?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is...
is...
is
that
the
problem,
then,
and...
and
not
the
precise
formulation
of
the
scienter
that's
required,
since
we
have
"knowing
and
willful"?
why
was
there
no
misapplication,
in...
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
wait
a
minute.
does...
does
he
have
to
use
the
funds,
if
he...
if...
if
one
diverts
funds
from,
say,
a
trust
fund...
i
know
that
that
wasn't
what
this
was...
but
if
one
diverts
funds
for
an
unauthorized
purposes,
that's
a
misapplication,
is
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
doesn't
have
to
be
for
his
own
use.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
would
you
agree
with
the...
with
the
circuit
that
the
misuse
has
to
be
knowing,
that
it's
an
exercise
of
control
or
dominion
that's
a
violation
of
the
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
the
term
"misapply"
is
not
clearly
established
in
the
law,
then
does
not
that
argue
in
favor
of...
of
interpretation
of
"willful
and
knowingly"
such
as
the
circuit
gave,
knowing
that
is
a
violation
of
the
law?
because
"misapply"
is...
is,
i
take
it,
not
a
well-settled
term
in...
in
our
jurisprudence...
or
is
it?
perhaps.
i
don't
know.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
these
funds
did
not
have
to
be
segregated
at...
at
the
time
of
the
conduct
here,
did
they?
they
didn't
have
to
be
put
in
a
segregated
account,
did
they?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
could
a
third-party
creditor
have
levied
on
them?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
at
page
15
of...
of
your
brief,
you
say
the
element
requires
that
the
defendant
be
aware
that
his
use
of
the
funds
is
unauthorized
or
wrongful.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i...
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
that
squares
with
the
answer
you
just
gave
justice
stevens.
suppose
he
doesn't
know
about
the
regulation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there...
there's
a...
a
felony
if
you
violate
the...
the...
the
provisions
in
a
school's
guidebook
or
manual?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
this
wasn't
embezzlement,
because
the
funds
could
be
commingled
and...
and
be
used,
i
take
it,
for
other
purposes,
provided
some
other
funds
were
adequate,
ultimately,
to
make
up
the
shortfall;
isn't
that
the
rule?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
if...
if
a
thief
comes
in
and...
and
takes...
and
takes
the
money,
it's
still
a
violation
not
to
refund
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
i...
i
thought
you
said
the
vi...
the
violation
is
not
making
the
refund
within
60
days.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
don't
have
the
money
because
they...
a,
somebody
stole
it;
b,
they
paid
some
other
account.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
suppose
they
think
they're
going
to
get
other
sums
to
make
up
the
shortfall,
and
they
just...
and
they...
and
they
don't,
something
just
happens?
