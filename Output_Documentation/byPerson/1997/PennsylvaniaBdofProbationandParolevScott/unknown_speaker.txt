unknown
speaker
now,
let
me
ask
you
a
question
or
two,
if
i
may,
general
fisher.
i
take
it
the
pennsylvania
courts
have
determined
that
the
consent
provision
that
was
signed
simply
did
not
go
beyond
consent
to
search
without
a
warrant
and
determined
that
that
did
not
mean
that
consent
was
given
to
a
search
without
reasonable
suspicion.
i
take
it
that's
the
thrust
of
what
the
courts
below
found.
unknown
speaker
and
presumably
pennsylvania
can
redraft
its
consent
form
to
cover
that,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
to
get
back
to
my
question,
i
take
it
they
just
said
that
this
form
that
was
signed
didn't
cover
the
issue
of
reasonable
suspicion,
that
all
it
covered
was
whether
it
could
be
without
a
warrant,
and
in
the
absence
of
a
consent,
then,
they
said
reasonable
suspicion
is
still
required.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
you're
right
in
saying
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
based
its
interpretation
of
the
consent
form
on
its
reading
of
the
fourth
amendment.
i
thought
they
might
have
just
based
it
on
an
interpretation
of
pennsylvania
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
you...
suppose
this
consent
form
were
redrafted
to
make
clear
that
the
person
paroled
is
consenting
to
a
search
without
a
warrant
and
to
a
search
without
any
suspicion
whatever.
suppose
it
were
drafted
that
way.
now,
what
do
you
think
the
pennsylvania
courts
would
say
to
that?
unknown
speaker
--the
fourth
amendment?
unknown
speaker
it
just
wasn't
clear
to
me
whether
that's
what
they
said,
because
they
could
have
meant
the
consent
form
just
didn't
cover
it.
unknown
speaker
where
do
they
say
that?
do
you
want
to
gives
us
the--
--don't
they
say
that
in
the
earlier
williams
case
is
where
they
said
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
this
case.
it's
in--
unknown
speaker
--because
the
consent
provision
did
not...
did
not
purport
to
waive
it.
i
mean,
isn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--williams
really
isn't
all
that
clear,
because
williams
relied
on
the
arkansas
williams
case,
which
is
also
ambiguous.
i
think
it's
really
hard
to
get
at
a
clear
bright
line
answer
from
the
williams
opinion.
unknown
speaker
there
are
two
questions--
unknown
speaker
--there
are
two
questions
here
really,
are
there
not?
the
first
is
the
fourth
amendment
question,
and
the
second
is
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
applies
to
probation
revocation--
unknown
speaker
--now,
what
if
we
thought
the
exclusionary
rule
didn't
apply?
unknown
speaker
didn't
apply.
then
do
we
reach
the
first
question
or
not?
what
difference
does
it
make--
unknown
speaker
--if
it
doesn't
apply?
unknown
speaker
one
of
our
concerns
with
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
case
of
police
investigations
of
crime
is
that
the
police
have
an
interest
in
trying
to
get
a
conviction.
will
the
respondents
tell
us
in
this
case
that
parole
officers
have
an
equivalent
interest
in
showing
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
parole,
or
is
the
dynamic,
the
incentive,
the
motivation
of
the
parole
officer
somehow
different
than
the
police
officer?
unknown
speaker
but
you
don't
think
the
police
officer
wants
to
put
somebody
in
jail
unless
he
thinks
he's
guilty,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
doesn't
the
parole
agent
have
a
slightly
different
motivation
in
this
respect.
if
the
parolee
whom
he
is
supervising
goes
berserk,
or
just
returns
to
criminal
activity,
the...
you
know,
the
outcry
is
going
to
be,
where
was
the
parole
supervision?
why
didn't
they
catch
this?
isn't
there
therefore
a
sort
of
built-in
motivation
on
the
part
of
a
parole
officer
to
be
very
cautious,
to
be
careful,
and
to
be
looking
for
signs
of
trouble,
which
puts
him
pretty
much
in
the
same
position
that
the
police
officer
is
in
in
looking
for
signs
of
trouble,
and
taking
action
to
cover
himself
as
well
as
to
protect
the
community
if
he
sees
signs
of
risk?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
wants
to
rehabilitate
those
who
are
not
violating
conditions,
but
i...
it
seems
to
me
he
has
just
as
much
motivation
to
recommit
those
who
are
violating
conditions
as
the
police
officer
does
to
arrest
and
see
to
the
conviction
of
somebody
who
is
violating
a
statute
in
the
street.
unknown
speaker
which
means
that
the
significance
of
illegally
seized
evidence
is
more
damning
in
the
parole
case
than
it
is,
perhaps,
in
the
trial
case.
unknown
speaker
because
as
you
say,
there's
no
such
presumption
that
the
evidence
has
to
overcome.
unknown
speaker
general
fisher,
are
other
rules
of
evidence
relaxed
or
foregone
in
a
parole
revocation
hearing
as
compared
with
a
criminal
trial?
i
mean,
here
you're
asking...
we're
discussing
a
rule
of
evidence
that
applies
sometimes
in
criminal
proceedings.
in
what
other
respects,
if
any,
are
rules
of
evidence
different
in
parole
hearings?
unknown
speaker
in
respect
to
that,
could
i
ask
you,
the
part
that
i
found
most
difficult
in
respect
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked
is
on
page
9a,
in
talking
about
the
question
of
consent,
the
court
cites
a...
an
earlier
case
and
says
that
there,
i
guess,
if
i'm
reading
it
correctly,
we
concluded
that
the
parolee's
signing
of
a
parole
agreement
giving
the
officer
permission
to
conduct
a
warrantless
search
does
not
mean...
and
here
they
say
two
things.
and
the
first,
it's
either-or,
and
the
either
says,
either
that
the
parole
officer
can
conduct
a
search
at
any
time
and
for
any
reason,
i.e.,
it
does
not
consent
to
random
searches,
or
that
he
relinquish
his
fourth
amendment
rights,
so
it
sounds
because
of
that
either-or
that
the
court
in
pennsylvania
is
holding
that
this
consent
is
not
a
consent
to
random
searches,
and
if
that
is
so,
how
could
we
reach
the
issue
of
whether
it
is
constitutionally
permissible
for
a
state
to
do
what
you
want
to
do,
which
is
to
conduct
random
searches?
unknown
speaker
so
in
your
view
if
pennsylvania
corrections
officials
recast
this
consent
and
said,
i
consent
to
the
search
not
only
without
a
warrant
but
without
reasonable
suspicion,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
would
say,
under
the
fourth
amendment
you
can't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
to
be
more
precise,
you
think
the
suspicionless
search
would
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
if
the
parolee
has
consented
to
it,
and
that
if
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
were
free
to
adopt
what
it
though
the
right
reading
of
that
consent
form
was,
it
would
so
interpret
it?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
general
fisher.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
is
that
realistic,
because
i
don't
know
how
much
longer
this
individual
is
going
to
be
put
away
as
a
result
of
the
revocation
here,
but
i
assume
that
in
most
states
a
parole
revocation
can
result
in
a
very
substantial
incarceration.
and
i
am
assuming
the
second
thing
that
you
may
want
to
comment
on,
and
that
is
that
if
there
is
a
substantial
period
of
reincarceration,
the
likelihood
of
an
independent
criminal
prosecution
for
the
acts
that
led
to
the
commitment,
recommitment,
is
probably
very
low.
the
state
is
probably
not
going
to
bother
to
prosecute
if
they
can
put
the
person
away
for
a
substantial
period
of
time
on
a
parole
revocation.
so
my
questions
are,
isn't
it
in
fact
a
lot
like
a
criminal
trial?
unknown
speaker
i
think
what
i
had
in
the
back
of
my
mind
was
this
argument.
the
argument
is
made,
and
i
guess,
as
i
recall,
it's
made
here,
that
nothing
much
is
to
be
gained
for
society
at
large
by
applying
an
exclusionary
rule
here
because
it's
already
gained
by
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
in
criminal
trials,
so
that
in
point
of
fact,
if
the
officer
is
not
deterred
from
illegal
conduct
by
knowledge
that
the
evidence
so
seized
cannot
be
used
in
a
criminal
trial,
there's
not
going
to
be
any
incremental
deterrence
by
saying
well,
you
can't
use
it
in
a
parole
revocation
either.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
the
parole
revocation
is
probably
going
to
be
the
only
proceeding
in
which
this
evidence
is
used,
if
the
parole
revocation
really
is
functioning
like
a
criminal
trial
and
that's
the
only
trial
that
there's
going
to
be,
then
the
argument
about
deterring
the
police
is
not
a
sound...
or
the
parole
officers
in
this
case
is
not
a
sound
argument.
because
in
fact
the
only
proceeding
in
which
the
evidence
is
likely
to
be
used
to
satisfy
society's
demands
is
the
proceeding
for
the
revocation
of
parole
and
therefore
it
would
make
sense,
if
we
are
going
to
take
the
fourth
amendment
to
apply
here,
to
say
there
ought
to
be
an
exclusionary
rule
for
the
same
reason
that
we
do
in
the
case
of
a
normal
criminal
trial.
unknown
speaker
mr.
stewart,
can
i
ask
you
one
question
before
your
time
is
up?
what
is
the
position
of
the
united
states
on
the
other
issue
in
the
case,
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
whether
pennsylvania
was
following
pennsylvania
law
or
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
so--
unknown
speaker
--you
would
take
the
view
that
if
it's
ambiguous,
then,
the
michigan
v.
long
principle
applies,
and
we
assume
that
they
were
at
least
pushed
in
their
direction
by
the
federal
constitution?
unknown
speaker
what
would
we
do
if
we
disagreed
with
you
on
that
question?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
regard
both
of
those
questions
to
be
constitutional
questions?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
sosnov,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
in
regard
to
your
second
point,
mr.
sosnov,
we
do
have
several
cases
that
say
if
a
state
court
in
deciding
a
question
before
it
is
mistakenly
of
the
view
that
its
conclusion
is
required
by
the
fourth
amendment,
then
we
will...
we
have
jurisdiction
to
disabuse
it
of
that
if
we
don't
think
it's
required
by
the
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it's
true,
the
portion
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
williams,
it's
under
the
subhead
fourth
amendment.
unknown
speaker
and
then...
i
know,
later--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's--
unknown
speaker
--and
that's
still
ambiguous
because
it
refers
to
an
arkansas
case
that
it
says
it
decided,
and
that's
ambiguous,
so
the
whole
thing
is
pretty
ambiguous.
unknown
speaker
and
that
part
of
it
says
that
in...
lots
of
times
our
constitution
gives
greater
protection
than
the
federal
does,
but
not
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
don't
they
say
in
the
opinion,
this
very
opinion,
that
they're
not
relying
on
the
pennsylvania
constitution?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
did
interpret
it...
i
mean,
i'm
not...
i
know
that
you
think
we
shouldn't,
but
if
you
did
reach
the
following
question,
is
a
random
gun
search
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment,
i
take
it
on
the
merits
the
question
would
be,
if
the
fourth
amendment
permits
random
drug
searches
without
consent
of
persons
who
have
never
been
convicted
of
a
crime,
why
doesn't
it
permit
random
gun
searches
with
consent
of
persons
who
have
been
convicted?
unknown
speaker
i'm
trying
to
focus
directly
on
the
constitutional
question
there.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
said,
assuming
that
pennsylvania
wrongly
thought...
i
don't
know
if
we
get
there.
assuming
that
pennsylvania
thought
that
the
constitution,
the
fourth
amendment,
prohibits
a
random
gun
search
of
a
parolee
with
consent,
what's
your
view
on
that?
the
argument
against
it,
if
the
constitution
permits
a
random
gun
search
without
consent
of
a
person
who
hasn't
been
convicted
in
certain
circumstances,
why
doesn't
it
permit
a
random
gun
search
with
consent
of
a
person
who
has
been
convicted?
unknown
speaker
maybe
you'll
agree
that
that
is
constitutional,
or
maybe
you
won't.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
they
say
no
probable
cause,
no
warrant,
if
it's
random,
done
as
a
law
enforcement
measure,
with
consent
by
the
parolee.
now,
that's
the
question.
now,
what's
the
answer?
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying,
then,
that
a
parolee
can't
consent
to
any
of
the
terms
of
the
parole?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
you
have
somebody
like
michael
milliken,
who
is
paroled
after
having
some
securities
fraud.
do
you
think
the
parole
authorities
can
say
you
can't
write
any
prospectuses
while
you're
on
parole?
unknown
speaker
that's
certainly
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
what
you're
saying
is
that
the
pennsylvania
parole
authorities
without
calling
this
a
consent
form
could
simply
say,
here
are
the
conditions
under
which
you
must
be...
which
you
will...
your
house
will
be
searched.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sosnov,
aren't
you
really
talking
about
notice
and
not
consent?
i
mean,
it's
the
same
form
that
says...
isn't
it
the
same
form
that
says,
no
drugs,
no
firearms,
and
warrantless
search?
it's
all
on
the
same
form,
and
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
that
the
no-firearms-no-drugs...
it's
really
a
notice
to
the
parolee
that
these
are
the
terms
of
your
release.
unknown
speaker
if
you
violate
them,
you
go
back.
so
to
talk
about
consent
for
any
of
this,
it's
really...
these
are
the
terms
and
conditions
of
your
release.
it's
a
true
hobson's
choice.
you
want
a
horse,
this
is
the
horse
you
get.
so
i
think
it
would
be,
i
think
more
honest
if
we
talked
in
terms
of
notice.
was
there
notice
when
this
form
says,
warrantless
search,
that
there's
not
going
to
be
a
search
unless
there's
reasonable
suspicion,
or
there's...
in
other
words,
is
there
ambiguity
in
the
terms--
unknown
speaker
--that
he
was
given.
unknown
speaker
i
still
don't
see
your...
understand
your
response
to
the
chief
justice's
question.
you
acknowledge
that
the
conditions
of
parole
for
milliken
could
be,
you
will
not
write
any
prospectuses,
so
the
condition
here
is,
you
will
be
subject
to
search
in
your
home.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
and
the
one
no
more
than
the
other
is
consonant
with
the
application
of
the
bill
of
rights
to
people
who
were
not
on
parole.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
in
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical
the
consent
is
valid
and
in
the
case
we
have,
assuming
the
consent
form
is
very
clear
that
you
consent
to
searches
that
are
absolutely
random
and
without
sufficient...
what
is
the
difference
in
the
two
cases?
i
don't
understand
your
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
suppose
you
have
consent.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
it's
any
more
involuntary
than
on
a
guilty
plea
situation,
where
someone
says,
okay,
i'm
going
to
agree...
i'm
guilty,
and
i
will
agree
to
a
prison
sentence
of
3
years,
very
coercive.
heavens,
look
at
the
power
the
government
has,
and
yet
i
think
we
would
say
it's
okay
to
give
up
your
right
to
a
jury
trial,
your
right
to
remain
free,
the
right
to
do
all
those
things.
you
can
consent
to
that.
now,
don't
look
at
the
clock.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
know
why
somebody
can't
consent
on
parole
and
say,
fine,
i
would
like
to
be
paroled
and
i
will
consent
to
these
terms
and
conditions.
why
isn't
that
perfectly
okay?
the
person
can
refuse
parole
and
say
no,
i
don't
want
those
terms
and
conditions.
i'll
serve
my
time,
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
parolee
can
decline
it
and
say,
i'll
serve
my
time
and
when
i
get
out
i
am
free.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
shortage
of
parole
officers
in
pennsylvania?
there
is
in
a
lot
of
states.
i
think
there
are.
what's
the
circumstance
there?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
wondering--
unknown
speaker
--what
is
in
the
back
of
my
mind,
which
is,
is
whether
it
might
be
reasonable
for
a
state
to
say
we
don't
have
that
many
parole
officers,
we'll
let
more
people
out
of
prison
on
parole,
but
they
give
up
all
their
privacy
in
prison,
and
we
want
them
to
give
up
some
of
their
privacy
on
parole,
and
the
reason
is
that
random
checking
can
catch
those
who
have
guns
or
drugs.
so
i
mean,
suppose
they're
reasoning
that
way,
and
so
the
object
is
a
system
that
will
actually
protect
people's
privacy
in
a
sense.
in
other
words,
you're
better
off
than
in
prison,
but
you've
got
to
give
up
a
certain
amount
of
your
privacy.
unknown
speaker
you
would
think
that
a
defendant
could
agree
in
a
pre-trial
plea
bargain
to
accept
parole
with
the
condition
of
suspicionless
search.
unknown
speaker
release--
unknown
speaker
--release,
but
i
agree,
suspicionless
searches
pretrial--
unknown
speaker
--do
you
think
there's
a
question
about
that?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
well,
why?
why
is
there
a
question?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
very...
very
odd.
i
mean,
he
can
give
up
his
right
to
a
jury,
his
right
to
an
attorney,
his
right
to
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
well,
don't
they
do
that...
don't
they
do
that
now?
they
require
the
parolee
to
come
in
periodically
and
report
to
the
officer
what
he's
been
doing
for
the
last
couple
of
weeks.
isn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--that's
standard,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
he
can
come
in
and
when
his
parole
officer
says,
well,
you
know,
what
have
you
been
doing
the
last
couple
of
weeks,
he
can
say,
well,
you
know,
i'd
like
to
tell
you
that,
but
i
have
a
fifth
amendment
right
not
to
tell
you?
unknown
speaker
that's
pretty
easy.
that
can't
be
what
it
means,
can
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
mean
you
can
say
he
could--
unknown
speaker
--incriminate
him.
i
mean--
--you
can
say,
i
went
to
the
movie,
and
i
had
dinner
at
home
with
the
kids,
and
then
i
did
something
else
i
can't
tell
you
about?
[laughter]
that
just
can't
be
the
rule.
that
can't
be
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sosnov,
may
i
ask
if
you
would
get
to
the
second
question,
because
as
i
understand
it
all
of
this
is
academic
if
the
exclusionary
rule
doesn't
apply.
then
we
could
say,
yeah,
he
didn't
get
notice,
but
so
what,
the
evidence
comes
in
anyway.
you
made
the
point
that
most
states
require
suspicion
for
a
search,
but
isn't
it
also
true
that
most
states
say
the
exclusionary
rule
does
not
apply
to
parole
or
probation
revocation?
unknown
speaker
why
was
the
respondent
arrested,
for
what
suspected
offense?
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
the
arrest
was
not
dependent
upon
the
subsequent
search?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
they
have
suspicion
here?
unknown
speaker
so
a
good
parole
officer
has
more
people
reincarcerated
than
on
release.
two
parole
officers,
one
has
a
very
high
reincarceration
rate,
the
other
doesn't,
and
the
first
is
the
better
parole
officer?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
institutional
pressure
i
assume
relates
to
performance
and
to
merit.
unknown
speaker
but
if
being
a
good
parole
officer,
as
justice
kennedy's
question...
means
keeping
your
people
out
on
parole
rather
than
reincarcerating
them,
one
would
think
that
the
institutional,
pressures
are
in
the
opposite
direction,
not
to
return
as
many
of
the
people
in
your
charge
to
prison
as
possible,
but
to
work
with
them
to
keep
them
out.
unknown
speaker
who
would
decide...
supposing...
what
does
the
pennsylvania
parole
board...
they
have
a
parole
board
and
they
have
hearings
on
revocation.
who
would
decide
whether
or
not
the
exclusionary
rule
would
bar
a
particular
witness'
testimony,
the
parole
board?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
are
the
pennsylvania
examiners
all
lawyers?
unknown
speaker
have
them
toss
a
coin?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
a
nonlawyer
going
to
do
with
some
of
our
rather
highly
filigreed
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
that
was
the
neutral
magistrate
to
issue
a
warrant,
or...
it
wasn't
to
ultimately
decide
the
question.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's...
a
neutral
magistrate
in
that
sense
is
not
the
same
as
the
person
who
finally
disposes
of
a
case,
of
a
question
the
way
you
would
have
under
the
exclusionary
rule.
do
you
know
of
any
other
situations
in
which
nonlawyers
decide
whether
or
not
evidence
should
be
excluded
pursuant
to
the
exclusionary
rule?
unknown
speaker
no
worse
than
the
situation
that
the
individual
would
have
confronted
if
he
were
still
incarcerated.
unknown
speaker
he
would
have
been
subject
to
invasions
upon
his
privacy
without
any
recourse.
unknown
speaker
and
this
is...
this
goes
along
with
parole.
unknown
speaker
mr.
sosnov,
you
don't
mean
it
happens
so
far
in
the
sense
of
the
real
world,
because
you
told
me
it
was
correct
that
most
states
in
their
parole
revocation
hearings
do
not
exclude
unlawfully
seized
evidence,
so
it's
true
that
right
now,
that
this
happens
all
the
time,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
sosnov.
general
fisher,
you
have--
unknown
speaker
--3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
