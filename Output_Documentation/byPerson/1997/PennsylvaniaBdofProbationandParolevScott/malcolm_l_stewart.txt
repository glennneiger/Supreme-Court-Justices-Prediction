mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
although
the
united
states
believes
that
parole
may
validly
be
conditioned
on
the
parolee's
consent
to
search,
we
also
believe
that
this
case
can
be
decided
on
the
alternative
ground
that
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
should
not
apply
to
parole
revocation
proceedings.
this
court,
when
deciding
whether
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
extended
to
procedural
settings
other
than
the
criminal
trial,
has
recognized
that
that
determination
turns
on
a
balance
of
the
public
and
governmental
interests
at
stake
against
the
likely
determination
of
exclusion
of
unlawfully
acquired
evidence,
and
in
our
view
there
are
two
distinct
governmental
interests
that
militate
against
application
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
first,
and
i
think
the
nub
of
our
argument
is
that
where
an
individual
has
already
been
convicted
of
a
crime
and
has
been
released
in
the
community
based
upon
the
condition
that
he
abide
by
specified
terms
of
release,
there
is
an
overriding
public
and
governmental
interest
in
accurate
and
complete
information
regarding
the
question
of
whether
the
parolee
has,
in
fact,
complied
with
those
terms.
at
the
very
premise
of
parole
is
that
parolees,
persons
previously
convicted
of
crimes,
pose
a
greater
risk
of
committing
further
unlawful
acts
than
does
the
average
citizen,
and
the
purpose
of
the
revocation
hearing
is
not
simply
to
punish
the
parolee
for
violation
of
the
conditions
of
his
release
but
rather
to
determine
whether
the
parolee
can
safely
be
left
in
the
community.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
is
certainly...
it
has
some
of
the
same
consequences
of
a
criminal
trial,
namely
that
the
individual
is
incarcerated.
with
respect
to
mr.
scott,
the
state
has
represented
in
its
reply
brief
that
scott
was
up
for
reparole
i
believe
in
1997
and
reparole
was
denied,
and
that
he
is
up
for
reparole
again
in
1998,
so
certainly
the
finding
of
parole
violations
may
ultimately
have
the
effect
of
requiring
him
to
serve
his
whole
term.
on
the
other
hand,
they
do
not
preclude
the
possibility
that
he
can
convince
the
state
parole
board
that
in
fact
he
warrants
rerelease
notwithstanding
both
the
prior
crime
and
the
subsequent
violation
of
the
terms
of
parole.
as
to
your
second
question,
while
parole
does
have
some
of
the
same
consequences
as
the
initial
criminal
conviction,
the
court
has
recognized
most
emphatically
in
morrissey
v.
brewer
that
the
parole
revocation
proceeding
need
not
take
on
the
procedural
accoutrements
of
the
criminal
trial,
that
because
the
individual's
initial
liberty
interest
has
already
been
extinguished
by
the
fact
of
the
prior
crime
and
the
prior
conviction,
what
is
at
stake
is
the
conditional
liberty
interest
of
somebody
who
has
been
released
as
subject
both
to
conditions
that
wouldn't
be
imposed
on
the
citizenry
at
large
and
closer
supervision
and
monitoring
to
make
sure
that
those
conditions
are
met.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
the
two
answers
we
would
say
to
that
are,
first,
individual
cases
may
arise
in
which
the
primary
or
even
the
only
use
of
the
evidence
acquired
is
for
parole
revocation
proceedings.
but
an
officer
certainly
wouldn't
know
that
before
he
or
she
began
to
conduct
the
search,
and
the
possibility
that
evidence
of
very
serious
additional
criminal
acts
might
be
discovered
and
might
not
be
usable
at
a
subsequent
criminal
prosecution
for
those
acts
would
be
expected
to
amount
to
a
substantial
deterrent
to
the
extent
that
the
individual
parole
officer
was
looking
at
things
from
a
law
enforcement
perspective.
the
other
thing,
the
point
i
would
like
to
make,
and
i
think
this
follows
on
the
heels
of
the
point
that
general
fisher
was
making,
is
that
we
expect
parole
officers
to
operate
under
a
different
incentive
structure
than
do
police
officers.
that
is
not
to
deny
that
there
is
a
law
enforcement
component
to
what
parole
officers
do.
certainly
there
is.
but
the
parole
officer
also
develops
a
continuing
relationship
with
the
parolee,
thinks
of
the
parolee
as
a
client
in
some
sense,
and
is
expected
to
balance
those
two
possibly
competing
obligations.
and
for
instance,
this
court
has
said
that
magistrates
and
state
legislators
don't
need
the
deterrent
of
the
exclusionary
rule,
because
they
can
be
expected
to
be
neutral
without
it.
presumably
the
court
didn't
mean
that
magistrates
and
state
legislators
have
no
interest
in
the
apprehension
of
criminals
or
the
enforcement
of
the
criminal
law.
rather,
those
officials
are
neutral
in
the
sense
that
they
are
institutionally
well-positioned
to
take
account
both
of
the
societal
interest
in
the
enforcement
of
the
law
and
the
individual
interest
in
avoiding
unwarranted
incursions
on
personal
liberty,
and
we--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--our
position
is
that
if
the
consent
form
is
construed
to
authorize
searches
without
individualized
suspicion,
that
that
consent
form
is
consistent
with
the
fourth
amendment.
we
don't
take
a
position
on
what
the
pennsylvania
consent
form
meant,
and
we
frankly
think
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
opinion
both
in
this
case
and
in
williams
are
ambiguous
on
that
score.
i
think
that
means
on
the
one
hand
that
there
is
not
the
plain
statement
of
independent
state
law
grounds
that
would
preclude
this
court's
jurisdiction--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--but
i
think
it
also
means--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i...
we
assume
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
this
court
has
jurisdiction
to
reach
the
issue
obviously,
when
the
court
has
two
alternative
grounds
on
which
it
could
decide
the
case,
the
relative
certainty
that
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
resolution
of
exclusionary
rule
issue
was
based
solely
on
federal
constitutional
grounds
might
cause
the
court
as
a
prudential
matter
to
decide
that
that's
likely
to
be
a
cleaner
and
more
final
resolution
of
the
case
than
deciding
the
case
on
the
consent
issue.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
you
disagreed
with
us
on
the
exclusionary
rule?
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
if
you
disagreed
with
us
on
the
exclusionary
rule,
then
i
suppose
you
would
have
to
determine
first
whether
you
had
jurisdiction
to
determine
the
propriety
of
the
search
and,
second,
if
you
had
jurisdiction
whether
the
search
was
valid.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well,
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
question
is...
it's
a
question
of
federal
law.
it
is
constitutionally
grounded.
obviously,
the
court
has
said
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
constitutionally
compelled.
the
court
has,
however,
held
that
state
courts
are
required
to
employ
the
federal...
the
fourth
amendment
exclusionary
rule
in
state
criminal
proceedings,
and
to
that
extent
this
court
has
held
it
has
authority
to
require
that
procedure
of
at
least
some
state
officials.
again,
going
back
to
what
we
see
as
the
overriding
governmental
interest
here,
this
court
in
lopez-mendoza
made
clear
that
the
exclusionary
rule,
at
least
ordinarily,
would
not
be
applicable
in
situations
where
the
purpose
of
a
proceeding
was
to
determine
whether
an
ongoing
violation
was
being
committed,
as
opposed
to
proceedings
where
the
purpose
was
to
impose
a
sanction
for
a
prior
violation.
i
mean,
in
some
sense
a
parole
revocation
hearing
has
attributes
of
both.
on
the
one
hand,
we
are
talking
about
a
violation,
possession
of
firearms,
that
occurred
at
a
discrete
point
in
time.
on
the
other
hand,
the
point
of
the
proceeding
is,
again,
to
determine
not
simply
whether
mr.
scott
should
be
punished
for
a
prior
bad
act,
but
whether
he
can
safely
be
allowed
to
remain
in
the
community.
and
the
final
thing
i'd
say
is,
we
do
think
that
the
nature
of
parole
revocation
hearings
is
such
that
imposition
of
the
exclusionary
rule
would
substantially
change
the
character
of
the
proceeding.
that
is,
in
the
federal
system,
for
instance...
i'm
sorry.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
