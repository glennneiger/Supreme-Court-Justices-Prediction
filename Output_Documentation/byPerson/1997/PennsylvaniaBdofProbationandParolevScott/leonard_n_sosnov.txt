mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
an
initial
matter
i
think
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
court
should
not
raise...
reach
the
issue
of
whether
a
parolee
can
voluntarily
consent
to
suspicionless
searches.
the
first
one
the
court
has
already
mentioned,
and
that
is
that
there
is
an
independent
and
adequate
state
ground
here.
unlike
michigan
v.
long,
this
case
involves
a
state
regulation,
a
state
parole
form
to
construe.
michigan
v.
long
just
involved
a
free-floating
constitutional
analysis.
secondly,
this
court
said
in
griffin
that
when
there
is
a
state
regulation
involved,
as
in
this
case,
we
take
the
meaning
as
fixed
by
the
supreme
court
before
we
get
to
any
constitutional
analysis.
thirdly,
if
you
look
at
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
this
case,
as
far
as
the
opinion,
the
supreme
court
opinion
refers
only
to
one
case,
williams.
it
says,
we
rely
on
williams,
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
case.
it
says
that
twice.
if
this
court--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--correct,
if
the
state
felt
compelled,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
evidence
here
is
not
that
the
state
felt
compelled,
because
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
referred
only
to
a
pennsylvania
supreme
court
decision.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
well,
there's
another
portion
of
williams--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--there's
another
portion
of
williams.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
the
other
portion
of
williams--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--well,
there's
two
things
about
that.
first
of
all,
the
last
part
of
williams
independently
analyzes
the
pennsylvania
constitution,
and
reaches
the
result
of
that's
how
we're
going
to
construe
that--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--and
it
cites
no
federal
constitutional
law
in
making
the
independent
constitutional
analysis.
under
pennsylvania
constitutional
analysis
this
court's
opinions
are
not
referred
to.
they
look
to
other
states.
they
look
to--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--they're
not
relying
on
the
pennsylvania
constitution
in
this
very
case,
but
in
this
very
case,
before
they
get
to
the
fourth
amendment
issue
they're
making
an
independent
construction
of
the
state
provision.
i'd
like
to
point
out
one
other
thing,
and
that
is
that
this
court
looks
beyond
the
face
of
scott
referring
to
williams.
there's
another
pennsylvania
supreme
court
case,
commonwealth
v.
gibson,
cited
in
my
brief,
which
says
as
a
matter
of
state
pennsylvania
law
consent
has
to
be
specific
and
unequivocal,
and
now
that
gets
to
my
second
position.
when
you
read
the
provision,
the
provision
says,
i
consent
to
without
a
warrant.
let's
say
this
court
disagrees
with
me
on
the
adequate
independent
state
ground
issue.
where
does
that
leave
us?
that
leaves
us
with
this
court
construing
that
provision.
if
you
construe
that
provision
without
a
warrant,
certainly
in
light
of
this
court's
prior
jurisprudence
without
a
warrant
doesn't
mean
without
any
objective
level
of
information.
griffin
itself
said,
you
need
reasonable
suspicion
to
search
a
parolee's
home.
you
don't
need
a
warrant.
terry
v.
ohio,
you
need
reasonable
suspicion.
there
is
nothing
on
the
face
of
this
provision
that
waives
anything,
if
it's
capable
of
waiving
anything,
that
waives
anything
except
a
warrant.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
if
the--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--aside
from
consent.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i
think
there--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--i
think
it
would--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--a
two-part
answer.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
first
of
all,
a
random
search
of
an
individual's
home
would
not
be
permissible
under
the
constitutional
normally.
of
course,
you
need...
under
payton
you
need
a...
probably
cause
and
a
warrant,
so--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--the
answer
to
that
is
that
this
court
should
not
find
voluntary
consent,
because
as
this
court
has
interpreted
the
term
before,
it
certainly
should
not
abandon
that
interpretation.
what
voluntary
consent
means
is
a
free
and
unconstrained
choice
without
any
coercion,
explicit
or
implied.
now,
unless--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--no.
that's
not
my
position
at
all.
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
state
cannot
impose
an
unconstitutional
condition
as
a
matter
of
probation
or
parole
and
then
try
to
sustain
that
on
a
theory,
a
fictional
theory
of
consent,
as
in
this
case.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
of
course.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
but
it
doesn't
depend...
the
validity
of
parole
conditions
and
probation
conditions
don't
depend
on
the
consent,
or
a
fictional
notion
of
consent
of
the
probation
of
parolee.
every
day
around
the
country
people
are
put
on
probation,
they're
put
on
parole,
and
nobody
asks
the
consent
of
the
probationer
to
particular
conditions.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
that's
correct,
but
as
long
as
they
were
constitutional
they'd
be
upheld
by
this
court,
but
if
pennsylvania,
as
in
this
case,
touched
an
unconstitutional
search
provision,
it
should
be--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--that's
correct.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--that--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--excuse
me.
that's
exactly
my
position,
and
that
was
the
position
of
the
supreme
court,
that
when
you
list
the
conditions
of
probation
and
parole,
it
serves
only
the
function
of
notice.
it
doesn't
determine
the
constitutionality.
if
we
use
the
fiction
of
consent
in
this
case,
pennsylvania
can
just
simply
attach
a
couple
of
new
conditions
the
next
time.
their
form
the
next
time--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--and--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--this
court
would
have
to
determine
that
each
one,
whether
it
was
reasonable
or
not.
given
all
the
reasoning
of
griffin,
the
one...
it
could
set
explicitly,
your
condition
of
parole
is
that
you
will
be
subjected
to
searches
of
your
home
without
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
that
would
be
totally
inconsistent
with
the
reasoning
of
this
court's
decision
in
griffin.
in...
and
this
court's
decision
in
many
other
areas.
in
other
words,
this
court
has
said
the
proper
balance
that
a
parolee
certainly
has
a
right
to
an
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
home
and
a
right
to
reasonable
searches.
this
court
said
in
griffin,
we're
not
going
to
require
probable
cause
and
a
warrant.
we're
not
going
to
require,
as
if
she
was
a
free
citizen,
the
proper
balance
between
the
government's
needs
and
the
right
of
privacy
of
the
parolee.
the
proper
balance
is
struck
with
reasonable
suspicion,
the
lowest
objective
standard
known
under
the
law,
as
this
court
emphasized
by
richards
v.
wisconsin.
but
it's
an
objective
standard.
pennsylvania's
not
free
to
unilaterally
get
around
constitutional
restraints.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
because
in
neither
case
does
it
depend
on
consent.
in
neither
case
the
correct
constitutional
analysis
is
to
determine,
is
it
reasonable,
considering
the
government's
needs
and
concerning
the
rights
of
the
parolee,
whether
we
talk
about
first
amendment
rights,
fourth
amendment
rights,
so
that
this
court--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--the
consent
would
be
involuntary.
that's
my
point.
it's...
in
other
words,
if
we
consider,
if
i--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i
think
the
answer,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
there's
nothing...
this
is
nothing
like
the
free
bargaining
process.
what
this
court
has
emphasized
in
a
number
of
decisions
is
the
plea-bargaining
process
is
bargaining
between
two
roughly
equal
parties,
and
that
the
defendant
has
a
lot
of
bargaining
chips
in
that
situation,
so
the
process
is
completely
different.
the
defendant
can
insist
on
a
trial.
the
defendant
can
insist
to
be
put
to
the
proof
of
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
so
that
every
day,
defendants
reject
plea
bargains
that
are
offered,
because
defendant
calculates,
i
may
make
out
better
at
trial,
and
the
government
calculates,
we
need
this
plea
bargain
because
we
may
lose
entirely
and
the
defendant
will
go
scott-free.
here,
the
process
itself,
the
parolee
has
no
bargaining
chips
whatsoever.
the
parolee
has
no
constitutional
rights
that
he
can
bargain
with,
so
the
process
is
different.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
if...
the
parolee
has
the
ability
to
say
no,
and
schneckloth
said
everybody
always
has
the
ability
to
say
no.
in
other
words,
a
voluntary,
free
and
unconstrained
choice
is
not
the
same
thing
simply
as
a
choice.
in
other
words,
every
individual
can
say
no
unless
you're
drugged
or
unconscious.
that's
what
schneckloth
said.
i
think
minnesota
v.
murphy
is
a
good
example
of
coercion,
where
a
person
has
a
right
to
say
no.
minnesota
v.
murphy,
the
police
officer
was
given
the
choice.
you
can
continue
being
a
police
officer,
or
you
can
start
talking,
even
though
you
have
fifth
amendment
rights,
and
the
police
officer
started
talking.
he
had
a
choice,
just
like
scott,
and
this
court
said,
that
was
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment.
that
was
involuntary.
that
was
the
antithesis...
the
economic
coercion
was
the
antithesis
of
a
free
and
unconstrained
choice.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i'm
not
aware
that
there's
a--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--i
can't
address
that.
i
don't
know.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
this
court
has
never
accepted
that
argument.
morrissey
v.
brewer,
the
exact
same
argument
was
made.
we're
going
to
parole
fewer
people
if
you
actually
make
us
have
a
hearing
to
determine
whether
we
revoke
them
or
not,
and
this
court
said
there's
no
empirical
proof
that
if
people
have
a
hearing
and
have
some
rights
that
they're
going
to
stop
paroling
people.
and,
in
fact,
most
jurisdictions
around
the
country
right
now
have
interpreted
griffin
as...
in
fact,
every
court
that
has
interpreted
griffin
has
interpreted
it
to
require
reasonable
suspicion.
however,
you
have
not
seen
a
drop-off
of
paroles
around
the
country
or
any
disadvantage
to
the
parole
system,
so
there
is
no
demonstrated
need.
and
getting
back
to
the
plea-bargaining
question
of
justice
o'connor,
the
other
thing
that
distinguishes
this
from
a
plea
bargain
is
that
of
course
the
government
doesn't
have
the
power
to
impose
a
guilty
verdict.
the
plea
bargain--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--possibly.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
that's
a
difficult
question
to
be--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--that--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--that...
there
is
a
question
there.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
but
it's
completely
different.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
because...
because
this
court
would
have
to
determine
whether,
considering
the
invasion
of
privacy
down
the
line,
which
is...
which
is
all
the
people
that
are
on
parole
as
far
as...
and
their
families
being
subjected
to
unbridled
discretion.
this
court
has
to
decide
whether
that
is
one
of
those
rare,
bargained-for,
agreed
conditions
that
should
be
overturned.
most
likely--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--the
key
difference...
the
key
difference
there,
and
maybe
that
is
constitutional.
i'm
not
saying
it's
not.
the
key
difference
there
is
that
it
is
one
of
the
bargained-for
things
as
part
of
the
plea-bargain
process.
there
is
no
bargaining
process
here.
there
is
no
deal
in
the
end,
and
a
plea
bargain
in
the
end
is
enforceable
by
a
court.
once
you
have
plea
bargain,
each
side
has
to
abide
by
the
plea
bargain.
this
is
nothing
like
a
plea
bargain
because
in
the
end
here
pennsylvania
by
law,
state
law,
pennsylvania
can
impose
subsequent
conditions
after
the
person
is
released
from
parole,
so
after
he
signs
that
form
there
with
all
the
conditions,
they
can
come
2
days
later,
oh,
by
the
way,
you've
got
10
more
conditions.
they
don't
have
to
have
him
sign
a
form
and
agree.
the
consent
is
a
fictional
notion.
if
this
court
would
accept
the
fictional
notion
of
consent,
pennsylvania
could
have
a
couple
of
new
provisions,
and
one
of
them
could
say
that
when
you're
on
probation
or
parole,
you
have
to
tell
us
everything
of
any
criminal
activity
you're
doing.
in
other
words,
despite
your
fifth
amendment
rights,
in
return
for
parole
you'd
have
to
tell
us
everything
about
your
criminal
activities.
i--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--but--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--but
there's
one
restriction,
and
that's
the
fifth
amendment.
under
minnesota
v.
murphy
this
court
said
you
cannot
have
a
valid
condition
of
parole
that
requires
the
parolee
or
probationer
to
talk
about
criminal
activity.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
no.
he
can...
no.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
no,
that's
not
what
it
means.
it
means
he
can
talk
about...
he
must
talk
about
everything
except
activity
that
is
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--or
new
criminal
activity.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i...
i'm
relying
on
minnesota
v.
murphy.
this
court
said
it
would
be
the
classic
penalty
situation
if
a
probation
condition
required
somebody
to
talk
about
criminal
activity.
let
me
mention
another
one.
morrissey
v.
brewer,
the
rights
at
a
hearing,
pennsylvania
under
the
fiction
of
consent
could
say,
in
return
for
you
getting
probation
or
parole
you
hereby
agree
that
if
we
decide
to
revoke
your
parole
you
won't
assert
your
right
to
try
to
cross-examine
and
confront
witnesses.
in
other
words,
this
court
would
be
ceding
its
role
as
being
the
ultimate
determiner
of
what's
reasonable
under
the
constitution
if
it
accepts
the
fiction
of
consent,
which
it
has
refused
to
do
in
the
economic
context
repeatedly,
such
as
garrity
v.
new
jersey.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
the
majority
of
states
have
ruled,
and
this
court
should
rule
that
the
exclusionary
rule
applies,
because
it's
especially
needed
in
this
context.
first
of
all,
under
pennsylvania
law,
what
was
being
performed
here
was
a
classic
law
enforcement
function.
pennsylvania's
own
manual
says
that
the
parole
officers
share
with
police
the
primary
goal
of
law
enforcement.
as
matter
of
state
law,
parole
officers
are
peace
officers
with
police
powers.
in
this
very
case,
the
parole
agent
had
arrested
mr.
scott
for
parole
violations.
he
was
in
a
post
arrest
situation.
he
was
in
cuffs,
in
custody,
when
the
parole
agent
goes
to
his
home
to
conduct
a
search
for
any
evidence
of
other
violations.
the
parole
agent
in
pennsylvania
serves
as
prosecutor
at
the
parole
violation
hearing,
so
certainly
in
the
context
of
this
case
to
start
out
with,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
this
was
a
classic
law
enforcement-type--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--he
was
arrested
for...
i
think
it
was
four
violations.
two
violations
were
that
on
an
individual
occasion
while
people
were
shooting
target
practice
that
he
held
the
gun
and
took
a
shot,
and
he's
not
allowed
to
possess
a
gun
even
momentarily,
so
back
in
september
when
he
was
first
paroled
he
was
alleged
to...
on
two
separate
occasions
to
have
taken
a
shot
from...
one
shot
and
then
two
shots
on
another
occasion.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
no.
the
search
followed
the
arrest.
it
was
to
gain
evidence
of
parole
violations.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
because
the
two
incidents
that
i
referred
to
were
5
or
6
months
earlier,
and
the
only
information
conveyed
to
the
searching
officer,
at
page
92a
of
the
appendix,
is
that
one
officer
said
to
the
other,
he
may
have
firearms,
and
that's
all
that
was
communicated,
nothing
else
about
a
basis
for
a
search,
and
pennsylvania
has
never
claimed
that
there's
reasonable
suspicion
in
this
case
in
the
lower
courts
or
here.
the
primary
zone
of
interest,
as
this
court
has
defined,
looking
at
the
exclusionary
rule,
the
purpose
is
deterrence.
the
question
is
deterrence.
so
when
the
attorney
general
talks
about
the
question
of
we're
looking
for
the
truth
at
a
parole
revocation
hearing,
we're
looking
at
the
truth
in
the
probation
revocation
hearing,
that's
what
we
seek,
that's
true,
but
it's
talking
about
constitutional
apples
and
oranges
here.
there
is
a
cost
whenever
you
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
as
far
as
some
evidence
that
might
be
helpful
to
determine
the
truth
if
it's
going
to
be
excluded
from
the
proceeding.
the
question
is,
though,
is
it
necessary
to
enforce
fourth
amendment
values?
that's
the
question.
and
here,
the
answer
is
clear.
the
parole
officer
is
even
more
motivated
than
a
police
officer
looking
for
a
crime
to
look
for
evidence
of
a
parole
violation.
the
police
officer
in
the
community
has
many
functions
besides
law
enforcement,
some
general
safety
in
the
community,
and
has
no
one-on-one
responsibility,
generally,
unless
they're
in
a
very
small
town,
has
no
one-on-one
responsibility
for
any
particular
individuals.
the
parole
officer
deals
only
with
the
population
of
convicted
criminals,
the
pressure,
the
institutional
pressure
being
responsible
for
convicted
criminals
and
their
supervision,
and
secondly,
one-on-one
responsibility.
that
parole
agent
was
assigned
to
a
particular
individual,
so
if
that
particular
individual
violates
parole
in
a
serious
way,
commits
a
new
crime,
the
responsibility
goes
right
back
to
the
parole
agent,
so
we
start
out
with
great
institutional
pressures
on
the
parole
agent,
more
so
than
the
policeman,
to
try
to
detect
violations
of
parole.
and
pennsylvania,
if
you
look
at
are
there
alternative
remedies
to
the
exclusionary
rule
to
try
to
provide
a
disincentive
for
unconstitutional
searches,
pennsylvania
has
no
alternative
remedies.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
no,
i
didn't
say
good
or
better.
what
i'm
saying
is,
the
institutional
pressure,
so
that
a--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--but
performance
and
merit
should
be
constrained
by
the
fourth
amendment,
so
i
wouldn't
call
a
good
parole
officer
one
who,
because
of
institutional
pressures
and
zeal
at
doing
their
job
and
protecting
themselves
from
possible
repercussions
if
somebody
messes
up
on
parole,
i
would
say
that's
not
a
good
parole
officer
who
violates
the
constitution.
what
it
shows
us,
the
institutional
pressures--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--some
work
to
keep
them
out,
but
the
pressures
to
make
sure
that
they're
complying
with
parole
regulations,
we're
talking
about
now
the
pressures
as
far
as
individuals
who
may
go
into
somebody's
home
with
no
reasonable
suspicion
whatsoever.
we're
not
talking
about
parole
agents
who,
in
accordance
with
the
reasoning
of
griffin,
only
go
in
the
homes
where
they
have
that
low
objective
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion.
we're
talking
about
parole
agents
who
may
go
into
their
home
without
that
objective
basis
of
reasonable
suspicion.
the
institutional
pressures
might
be,
i
don't
want
to
see
my
name
in
the
newspaper
possibly
because
my
parolee
got
in
some
kind
of
trouble,
so
therefore...
this
is
going
to
be
some
parole
officers...
the
institutional
pressures
are
going
to
cause
them
to
violate
the
constitution
unless
there's
some
deterrence,
and
that's
the
need
for
the
exclusionary
rule.
pennsylvania,
the
amicus
of
the
united
states,
nor
the
other
four
amicus
briefs
filed
against
our
position,
cite
a
single
instance,
either
under
pennsylvania
law
or
anywhere
in
the
country
where
there
has
been
any
discipline
of
a
parole
agent
for...
for
violation
of
fourth
amendment
rights,
any
successful--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--the
fourth
amendment
issue,
if
we
had
exclusionary
rule?
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
in
many
juris...
in
pennsylvania
it
would
be
a
hearing
examiner
or
the
board
itself.
the
hearings
are
conducted
by
the
parole
board
or
hearings...
many
jurisdictions
it's
judges.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
no,
they're
not
all
lawyers,
but
i
think
that
that
would
not
seriously
burden
the
proceedings
for...
for
two
reasons.
one
is--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--i
hope
not.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
well,
i
think
fortunately
in
this
context
the
hearing
examiner
would
not
have
the
learn
the
highly
filigreed
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence,
because
we
would
have
a
single
standard,
which
is
not
a
very
high
standard
of
reasonable
suspicion.
in
other
words,
griffin
has
set
the
stage
as
reasonable
suspicion
for
the
entry
into
a
home,
so
they'd
have
to
understand
reasonable
suspicion,
and
this
court
in
shadwick
v.
city
of
tampa
said
that
even
a
court
clerk
can
figure
out
what
probable
cause
means
in
determining,
for
example,
when
people
should
be
arrested
for
minor
offenses,
so
i
don't
think
it's
going
to
be
beyond
the
intellectual
abilities
of
hearing
examiners--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--well,
but
the
question
had
to
be
decided
whether
it
was
probably
cause
or
not
to
issue
a
warrant.
in
other
words,
every
day
the
court
clerk
sits
there
and
the
applications
come
in
and
the
court
clerk
has
to
say,
do
i
find
enough
here
for
probable
cause.
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
i
know
that
right
now
there
are
about
eight
states
that
are
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
either
on
state
constitutional
grounds,
where
they've
interpreted
it
under
the
federal
constitution,
and
not
all
of
them
have
judges
deciding
these
issues,
and
there's
been
no
evidence
that
they've
been
incapable
of
making
this
reasonable
suspicion
determination
as
to
whether
the
constitution
has
been
complied
with
as
far
as
reasonable
suspicion
being
required
for
an
entry
into
the
home
of
a
parolee
and
his
family.
there
have
been...
no
encountered
difficulties
have
been
reported.
one
of
the
dangers
here,
i
think
if
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
recognized
in
this
context,
is
because
the
standard
is
only
reasonable
suspicion
for
the
intrusion
in
the
first
place,
if
this
court
doesn't
recognize
the
exclusionary
rule,
that
means
that
there's
no
neutral
oversight
whatsoever
before
the
parole
agents
go
into
the
home,
nor
is
there
any
kind
of
neutral
oversight
after
the
fact.
the
creation
is,
as
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said,
i
think
they
got
it
right
as
far
as
concluding
there
will
be
nothing
else
to
deter
parole
agents.
you
will
have
no
neutral
oversight
before,
because
only
reasonable
suspicion
is
required,
you
will
have
no
neutral
oversight
after
the
fact,
the
pennsylvania
parole
board
has
no
institutional
deterrence
mechanisms
in
force,
there's
no
punishment
for
violations--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--that's
correct,
but
this
court
had--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--and--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--well,
it
hasn't
so
far,
because
this
court
has
never
held
that
a
home
can
be
searched
on
the
basis
without
any
reasonable
suspicion
whatsoever,
i
think
for
good
reasons.
this
court
in
a
whole
line
of
decisions
has
said
the
home
is
sacrosanct
as
far
as...
as
far
as
protecting
the
privacy
of
the
home.
this
court
has
allowed
the
closely
guarded
category
of
suspicionless
minimal
intrusions,
like
drugtesting
under
some
circumstances.
this
is
a
maximum
intrusion.
this
is
the
biggest
intrusion,
to
go
into
somebody's
home--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--that
this
is
happening--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--in
some
jurisdictions
as
far
as...
now,
as
far
as...
and
that's
the...
that's
why
we
need
deterrence,
because
these
unconstitutional
searches
are
happening.
in
other
words--
mr.
leonard
n.
sosnov
--thank
you.
