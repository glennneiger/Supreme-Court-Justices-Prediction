mr.
d.
michael
fisher
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
about
pennsylvania's
ability
to
properly
supervise
the
21,000
prisoners
who
have
been
released
from
jail
into
the
community
on
parole.
in
this
case,
keith
scott,
the
respondent,
was
a
convicted
murderer
given
a
20-year
prison
sentence
and
was
released
on
parole
in
his
eleventh...
during
his
eleventh
year.
that
release
was
subject
to
a
number
of
conditions,
among
them
that
he
not
possess
or
use
firearms,
that
he
not
possess
or
use
drugs
or
alcohol,
that
he
reside
in
an
approved
residence,
and
the
condition
most
important
for
the
consideration
of
this
case
was
a
requirement
that
he
consent
to
a
search
of
his
person.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
that's
correct.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
justice
o'connor,
pennsylvania
supreme
court
interpreted
the
consent
provision
to
mean
that,
in
this
case,
that
scott
agreed
to
reasonable
searches
within
the
meaning
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
to
be
reasonable
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said
that
the
search
required
reasonable
suspicion.
that
is
the
issue
with
which
we
are--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--they
said
that
the...
their
interpretation
was
that...
their
reading
of
the
fourth
amendment
was
that
the...
that
scott
consented
to
a
reasonable
search,
and
that
a
reasonable
search
required
reasonable
suspicion.
we
believe--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
argue
very
strongly
that
they
did,
in
fact,
interpret
it
based
on
their
reading
of
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
is
where
we
disagree.
we
believe
that
a
search
of
a
parolee's
residence
may
be
without
suspicion,
or
a
suspicionless
search.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
it's...
we
believe
that
the
pennsylvania
courts
would
say,
based
on
what
they
said
in
this
case,
that
we
could
not
have
that
kind
of
consent
form,
because
we
believe
they
have--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--because
the
fourth
amendment
requires
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
no,
justice
o'connor,
we
think
they
said
very
clearly
that
the
fourth
amendment
requires
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
well,
they
said
it--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--they
said
it
both
in
the
williams
case,
but
in
this
case
at
the...
in
our
petition
for
certiorari,
which
contains
the
opinion
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
at
page
10a,
about
half-way
down
that
page,
the
second
paragraph.
it
says
applying
williams
to
the
instant
case
we
hold
that
appellee
has
a
fourth
amendment
right
against
unreasonable
searches
and
seizures
that
is
unaffected
by
his
signing
of
the
consent
to
search
provision.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
going
back
to
williams,
the
court
then
said
in
williams
that
you
had
to
have
as
a
matter
of
fourth
amendment
rights
reasonable
suspicion.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
well,
we
argue,
justice
stevens,
that
the
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
or
not
the
consent
in
this
case,
and
whether
or
not
the
law
of
the
fourth
amendment
gives
parole
boards
and
parole
agents
such
as
ours
the
right
to
conduct
these
searches
without--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--without
suspicion.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--well--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--and
justice
o'connor,
i
think
that
there
are
two
separate
questions
here.
we
believe,
as
we
have
argued,
that
you
do
not...
that
you...
that
parole
agents
in
our
state
can
conduct
suspicionless
searches
of
parolees,
but
in
the
event
this
court
does
not
agree
with
our
opinion
on
that,
we
believe
very
clearly
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
apply.
in
fact,
the
court
has
always
recognized
that
the
exclusionary
rule
imposes
substantial
costs
on
society,
as
it
withholds
trustworthy
evidence
and
impedes
the
search
for
the
truth
and,
in
fact,
this
court
has
never
extended
the
exclusionary
rule
beyond
criminal
trials
or
criminal
appeals,
and
there...
we
think
that
the...
in
fact
the
court
has
ruled
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
applicable
to
civil
proceedings,
that
the
exclusionary
rule
is
not
applicable
to
grand
jury
proceedings,
nor
is
it
applicable
to
civil
deportation
proceedings.
the
exclusionary
rule...
parole
revocation
proceedings
are
informal,
flexible
administrative
proceedings,
as
a
contrast
to
a
formal
criminal
trial.
that
is
why
we
believe
this
court
has
never
extended
other
rights,
such
as
the
right
to
counsel,
the
right
to
a
jury
trial,
the
right
to
confront
witnesses,
or
the
right
to
object
to
hearsay
testimony.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
we
think
the
motives,
and
we
think
the
role
of
parole
agents
is
different
than
police
officers.
so
the
police
officer's
primary
job
is
to
investigate
crime,
make
cases,
get
convictions,
which
has
been
recognized
in
cases
by
this
court,
but
parole
officers,
their
job
is
a
two-part
role.
it
is
protecting
the
community
from
people
like
scott,
convicted
murderers
who
have
been
put
back
in
the
community,
but
also
to
rehabilitate
the
individual.
parole
officers
who
returned
all
of
their
parolees
to
jail
would
be
failures,
so
we
think
that--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--certainly
he
wouldn't,
but
still
there's
a
different
standard,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
principal
role
of
a
police
officer
is
to
enforce
the
law,
to
carry
out
the
law,
but
the
parole
agent's
job
is
significantly
different
from
a
police
officer.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
yes,
your
honor.
certainly
the
parole
officer
has
a
dual
role.
as
you
have
said,
they
have
to
be
concerned
about
the
community.
when
people
like
scott,
convicted
murderers,
are
placed
back
in
that
community
they
obviously
have
a
responsibility
to
try
to
protect
the
community,
but
just
as
important
to
that
parole
officer
is
rehabilitation.
but
obviously,
one
of
the
reasons
why
we
believe--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--but
so,
too,
we
think
that
the
difference
between
a
formal
criminal
trial
and
of
revocation
proceeding
is
important
in
looking
at
the
question
of
the
exclusionary
rule.
one
who
stands
trial
stands
before
that
court
cloaked
with
the
presumption
of
innocence.
what
you
have
here
when
you're
dealing
with
a
convicted
murderer
who
is
out
on
parole
is
someone
who
has
been
convicted,
so
that
i
think
that
the
important
thing
for
the
parole--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--i
don't--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--but
the
issue
before
the
parole
board
at
a
revocation
proceeding
is
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
parolee
has
conducted
himself
pursuant
to
the
conditions
upon
which
he
was
released,
and
i
think
the
parole
board
has
the
right
to
know
all
of
the
reliable
evidence
which
if,
in
fact,
the
exclusionary
rule
were
applied
would
deny
that--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--well,
yes,
your
honor,
the
rules
of
evidence
are
relaxed
in
parole
revocation
proceedings.
for
instance,
the...
hearsay
evidence
is
readily
admitted
in
parole
revocation
proceedings.
there
is
a...
it's
an
informal
process.
normally,
the
case
for
the
parole
board
would
be
presented
by
a
parole
agent,
not
an
attorney,
not
an
attorney
representing
the
parole
board,
but
a
parole
agent
who
would
give
his
version
of
the
facts,
his
version
of
what
the
parolee
has
done
while
out
on
parole,
and
there's
a
vastly
different
give-and-take
in
the
process
of
the
parole
hearing.
for
instance,
parolees
generally
testify,
give
testimony
as
to
what
they
have
done,
and
so
it
is
a
very
informal,
flexible
proceeding,
and
that
is
why
i
believe
it
is
important
for
a
parole
board
to
be
able
to
get
the
benefit
of
all
relevant
evidence
which
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
that
parolee
should
be
allowed
to
stay
in
the
community
subject
to
the
conditions
or
to
be
turned...
to
be
sent
back
to
jail,
so
that's
why
we
would
ask
that
the
exclusionary
rule
not
be
extended
to
parole
revocation
proceedings.
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
the
issue
involving
the
validity
of
the
search.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
justice
breyer,
in
the
court's
opinion
in
the
scott
case,
from
which
you
read,
we
believe
that
a
full
reading
of
that
opinion,
and
particularly
their
holding,
makes
it
clear
that
they
were
interpreting
what
they
believed
to
be
a
reasonable
search,
which
was
that
a
reasonable
search
required
reasonable
suspicion.
that
goes
back
to
the
williams
case,
but
an
analysis
of
the
williams
case,
williams...
commonwealth
v.
williams
in
pennsylvania,
as
opposed
to
the
other
case
which
justice
stevens
referred
to,
an
analysis
of
that
williams
case
goes
in
quite
at
length
as
an
analysis
of
what
is
required
under
both
the
fourth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
and
what
is
required
under
article
i,
section
8
of
the
pennsylvania
constitution,
and
we
believe
very
strongly
that
the
court
couched
their
opinion
in
both
williams
and
in
scott
on
what
they
interpreted
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
do,
and
that
is
where
we
disagree.
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
is
where
we
find
the
major
disagreement,
and
we
think
that
the
suspicionless
search
which
we
believe
is
permissible
under
the
fourth
amendment
dealing
with
parolees
is
very
similar
to
the
kinds
of
searches
that
this
court
has
approved
before,
in
the
past.
the
analysis
to
look
at
is
whether
or
not
the
individual
had
a
diminished
expectation
of
privacy
and
whether
there
were
special
needs.
clearly,
we
think
that
a
parolee
who
was
released--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
but
in
the
prior
cases,
where
this
court
has
approved
suspicionless
searches
involving
drug
tests
of
student
athletes,
sobriety
checkpoints,
the
searches
of
firearm
dealers
border
stops,
we
think
this
case...
we
think
this
case
involving
parolees
fits
right
within
those
exceptions
which
the
court
has
properly
made
in
the
past,
approving
suspicionless
searches.
mr.
chief
justice,
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for--
mr.
d.
michael
fisher
no
rebuttal,
your
honor.
