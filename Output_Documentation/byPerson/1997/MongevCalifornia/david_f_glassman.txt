mr.
david
f.
glassman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
respondent
asks
this
court
to
confirm
that
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply
to
noncapital
sentencing
determinations.
the
court
has
traditionally
not
applied
the
clause
to
noncapital
sentencing
determinations,
actually
not
to
sentencing
at
all,
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
reserving
or
limiting,
i
should
say,
the
sole
exception
that
has
been
recognized
thus
far
by
the
court,
and
that
is--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
bullington
is
self-limiting,
that
bullington
does
not
purport
to--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
more
recently,
specifically
in
caspari
v.
bohlen,
the
court
has
described
bullington
as
arising
and
based
largely
on
the
rationale
that
applies
in
the
death
penalty
context.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
yes,
it
is,
your
honor,
because
it
is
our
position
that
the
ultimate
inquiry
in
the
double
jeopardy
context
is
whether
a
criminal
offense
is
being
adjudicated.
the
fifth
amendment,
after
all,
speaks
in
terms
of
a
criminal
offense.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
well,
justice
stevens,
the
court
has
allowed
for
enhancements
that
share
elements
of
the...
or
aspects,
i
should
say,
of
the
underlying
crime,
so...
i
don't
know
if
that
answered
the
question,
but
our
argument
generally--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--yes.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
our
argument
is
that...
is
yes.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
that,
for
example,
use
of
a
weapon
is
a
typical
element
of
a
sentence
enhancement.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
well,
it's
given
weight,
in
our
view,
insofar
as
the
court
has
generally
decided
that
recidivism
statutes
do
not
present
a
double
jeopardy
concern.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
and
that
is
why,
your
honor,
our
position
ultimately
is
that
the
crucial
concern
is
the
guilt
or
innocence
determination,
but
that
is
the
concern...
that
is
the
idea--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
that's
described
by--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--well,
there
is
disagreement,
i
think,
in
terms
of
the
nature
of
this...
of
exactly
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
perhaps...
and
this
relates
back
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
justice
stevens,
but
if
i
could
describe
my
view
of
how
this
originated
in
the
first
place,
although--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--well,
actually,
your
honor,
it's
our
position
that
this
is
a
traditional
recidivism
statute.
the
somewhat
unique
context
of
this
case
is
that
because
california
restricts
the
aggregating
prior
conviction
to
be
a
so-called
serious
felony,
as
described
in
california,
there
needed
to
be
in
this
case
an
inquiry
into
whether
it
was
a
particular
type
of
assault,
but
all
of
this
arises
after
and
only
after
the
guilt
determination
is
made,
and
returning
to
difrancesco,
it's
our
view
that
difrancesco
recognizes
that
the
ordeal
that's
described
as
part
of
the
double
jeopardy
inquiry
is
an
ordeal
that
extends
until
the
conclusion
of
the
guilt
determination.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
i
believe
the
answer
would
be
yes.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
your
honor,
my
understanding
of
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
the
double
jeopardy
determination
is
based
solely
on
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
which
has
been
labeled
a
sentencing
proceeding
and
which
we,
of
course,
consider
a
sentencing
proceeding,
is,
in
fact,
so
akin
to
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence
in
terms
of
its
structure--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--that
is
not
the
argument.
the
argument
that
you
have
proposed--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--i
cannot
recall
a
case
that
involves
that
particular--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--no.
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
your
honor,
in
this
case
the
trial
judge
was
reviewing...
or
the
sentencing
judge,
i
should
say,
was
reviewing
a
series
of
documents,
and
the
judge,
in
view
of
the
appellate
court
in
california,
was
not
entirely
precise
as
to
the
basis
of
the
judge's
determination
of
the
prior
conviction.
there
was
a
charge
of
a
prior
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon,
and
there
was
a
guilty
plea.
the
judge
only
formally
announced
that
he
was
moving
the
document
reflecting
the
conviction
into
evidence.
he
used
other
words,
such
as
judicial
notice,
to
refer
to
his
review
of
other
documents,
and
as
soon
as
he
decided
that
the
prior
conviction
had
been
established,
he
added
that
lest
there
be
any
doubt,
he
was...
he
had
reviewed
the
court
file.
now,
the
court
file
refers
to
the
documents
that
had
been
previously
submitted
to
that
court
and
in
this
case,
in
fact,
there
had
been
a
prior
hearing
at
which
the
petitioner's
guilt...
the
petitioner's
eligibility
under
the
statute
would
have
been
established
by
proof
of
his
personal
use.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
yes,
your
honor.
it's
our
interpretation
that
the
court
file
ostensibly
refers
to
the
documents
in
that
proceeding
that
have
been
previously
adjudicated.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
your
honor,
i'm
aware
that
the
state
courts
have
found
that
the
evidence
is
insufficient.
i'm
not...
but
my
point--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--no,
but
this
court
has
in
effect
reevaluated
those
kinds
of
determinations
in--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--no,
your
honor,
but
i
think,
for
example,
lockhart
v.
nelson
indicates
that
the
court
evaluates
the
nature
of
the
finding
that
was
made
to
determine
whether
it's
properly
characterized,
for
example,
as
insufficient
evidence
or
trial
error.
the
same
is
true
in
poland
v.
arizona,
which
is
a
case
in
the
bullington
context.
but
no,
we
do
not
dispute
that
the
state
courts
have
determined
that
there
was
insufficient
evidence
in
this
case.
in
our
view,
however,
that
entire
analysis
is
confined
to
the
sufficiency
context,
which
is
concluded
when
this
proceeding
begins.
i
would
also
like
to
describe
the
nature
of
this
proceeding,
because
the
petitioner's
argument
is
that
if
it
looks
sufficiently
like
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence,
it
is
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
guilt
has
been
resolved
prior
to
the
hearing
in
this
case,
and
therefore
and
argue
the
double
jeopardy
clause
does
not
apply.
in
california
in
these
proceedings,
the
record
is
abbreviated.
it
is
six
pages
in
the
excerpts
here.
the
record
is
static
and
fixed
under
state
law.
the
trier
of
fact
is
not
allowed
to
look
beyond
the
record
in
the
underlying
case.
that
is,
the
original
record.
the
defendant
is
on
notice
and
aware
of
all
potential
evidence.
typically,
no
defense
is
offered
and
none
was
offered
here,
as
has
been
pointed
out,
and
it
is
true
that
california
has
elected
to
provide
additional
procedural
guarantees
in
these
proceedings,
but
it
is
our
view
that
because
the
guilt
determination
has
been
completed
by
the
time
of
this
event,
as
justice
blackmun's
majority
opinion
in
difrancesco
describes
it,
that
is
behind
the
defendant
at
the
time
of
sentencing.
there
is
no
process
here
that
is
comparable
to
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence,
and
in
our
view
that
also
distinguishes
this
case
from
bullington
v.
missouri,
and
that
is
to
say
that
in
bullington,
of
course,
the
court
held
that
the
jury's
decision
to
sentence
the
defendant
to
life
in
a
capital
case
constitutes
an
acquittal
of
death.
and
justice
souter,
i
would
agree
with
your
observation,
or
the
suggestion
in
your
question,
that
the
inquiry
in
bullington
ultimately
was,
is
there
evidence
of
the
sole
issue
the
jury
decides,
namely
death
or
life,
and
i
submit
that
is
a
fundamentally
different
issue,
because
in
this
case,
unlike
in
the
capital
context,
the
jury
in
the
petitioner's
case
was
not
the
sentencer.
the
jury,
it
is
true,
decides
a
fact
within
the
sentencing
context,
and
that
fact
determines
whether
the
judge
can
double
the
sentence,
but--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--i'm
sorry,
justice
scalia.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
the
distinction
that
we
would
draw,
though,
justice
souter,
is
that
in
bullington
the
court
attaches
significance
to
the
fact
that
the
only
choice
in
the
sentence
is
the
choice
made
by
that
trier
of
fact,
and
in
this
case
that
is...
it
is
true
that
is
the
only
choice
the
jury
makes,
but
that
is
not
the
choice
that
ultimately
or
definitively
decides
the
sentence.
once
the
jury--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--of
course
not,
your
honor,
but
that's
because
i'm
not
merely
describing
a
process
in
california
in
which
the
judge
as...
decides
to
accept
or
reject
the
verdict,
or
the
decision
of
the
jury.
my
point
is
that
it
is
the
judge
in
california
in
this
noncapital
context
who
arrives
at
the
sentence.
the
judge
decides
to
apply
either
the
lower,
the
middle,
or
the
aggravated
term,
and
the
judge
decides
whether
to
allow
the
strike,
so
it
is...
it
seems
to
me
it's
fundamentally
different
than
in
bullington,
in
which
the
jury's
decision
decides
the
entire
event
in
the
sentencing--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--i
think...
i
guess
that
i
would
disagree,
your
honor,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
the
trial
on
the
offense
concern
remains
paramount
in
the
double
jeopardy
context,
but
with
respect
to
your
question--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--i
believe
that's
the
lesson
of
bullington,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
the
court's
holding
in
bullington
is
that
it
is
unique
to
the
death
penalty
process
to
carry
over,
or
that
the
offense
consideration
survives,
and
returning
to
the
court's
opinion
in
caspari
v.
bohlen,
the
court
there
has
suggested
that
it
is
that
uniqueness.
it
is
the
uniqueness
that
bullington
describes
as
arising
out
of
furman
v.
georgia.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
and
the
sentencing
discretion
that
is
required,
or
certainly
more
important
in
the
capital
phase,
is
not
at
issue
in
this
case,
and
that
is
why,
in
our
view,
when
justice
blackmun's
majority
opinion
in
bullington
described
a
hallmarks
penalty
trial
as
unique,
he
was
referring
to
the
uniqueness
of
the
context
of
that
case.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
court
does
not,
and
i
don't
think...
i
don't
understand
analytically
how
one
could
be
acquitted
of
a
sentence
and
that
is,
of
course,
the
petitioner's
argument,
that
this
is
somehow
an
acquittal,
as
though,
if
he
is
correct,
the
state
would
be
foreclosed
from
alleging
a
future
recidivism
action,
for
example,
or
that
in
the
context
of
a
death
penalty
case,
if
the
sole
aggravator
was
another
criminal
offense,
the
acquittal,
or
the
decision
of
life,
would
constitute
an
acquittal
of
that
future
crime.
for
these
reasons,
because
this
case
fits
squarely
within
the
recidivism
context,
or
the
sentencing
context,
i
believe
that
the
court's
description
in
caspari
is
significant
here,
and
that
is,
the
court
has
observed
in
caspari,
which
has
been
minimalized
as
a
teague
v.
lane
case,
but
in
fact
i
think
the
teague
analysis
is
not
irrelevant
here
when
the
court
in
caspari
says
that
the
determination,
the
prior
determination
of
a
sentence
is
an
objectively
verifiable
fact,
based
upon
readily
available
evidence.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
your
honor,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
the
teague
analysis
controls
the
case
or
is
determinative,
but
my
point
is
simply
that
when
the
court
said
in
teague
that,
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
double
jeopardy
applied
to
noncapital
sentencing,
justice
o'connor's
majority
opinion
clearly
says
that
the
court's
prior
precedents
had
gone
in
exactly
the
opposite
direction.
i
think
that
that
observation
in
caspari
was
correct,
as
was
the
court's
observation
in
caspari,
unlike
the
concerns
in
the
double
jeopardy
context,
that
when
dealing
with
noncapital
sentencing,
and
particularly
the
prior
offender,
there
is
an
increased
accuracy
in
verifying
the
record
in
the
prior
case.
california
has
implemented
a
variety
of
procedures,
all
of
which
are
discretionary,
to
make
this
a
fair
proceeding.
none
of
the
rights
that
california
has
granted
are
required
and
in
our
view
those
rights
do
not
constitutionalize
this
event
or
otherwise
graduate
it
into
a
double
jeopardy
context
that
it
would
not
be
in
unless
these
hallmarks
are
present.
mr.
david
f.
glassman
your
honor,
i
don't--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--and
i
don't
believe
that
their
argument...
in
other
words,
that
the
presence
of
these
hallmarks
is
directed
at
the
element
issue.
in
other
words,
the
emphasis
that--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--it's
a
fair
way
to
answer
it,
perhaps,
but
again,
my
reading
of
cases
such
as
mcmillan
v.
pennsylvania
indicate
that
it
is
not
the
shared
elements
test
that
is
determinative,
and
that
in
our
context,
in
the
double
jeopardy
analysis--
mr.
david
f.
glassman
--may
i
answer
the
question,
your
honor?
mr.
david
f.
glassman
double
jeopardy
in
my
view
speaks
to
guilt
only.
thank
you.
