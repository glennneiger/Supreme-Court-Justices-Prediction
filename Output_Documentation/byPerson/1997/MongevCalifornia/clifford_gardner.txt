mr.
clifford
gardner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
judge
in
this
case,
or
the
jury,
had
found
sufficient
evidence
to
sustain
the
charged
allegation,
and
the
state
court
of
appeal
had
affirmed
that
finding,
that
judgment
as
to
my
client
would
have
been
final.
i
could
not
go
into
state
court,
empanel
a
new
fact-finder,
and
try
it
again.
this
case
arises,
or
presents
the
flip
side
of
the
question.
mr.
clifford
gardner
my
guess
is
that
it's
a
rule
of
finality.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
there
could
be
a
collateral
attack,
certainly,
but
i
could
not
go
in
in
the
absence
of
some
kind
of
new
evidence.
the
case
would
be
final
on
direct
appeal
as
to
my
client.
mr.
clifford
gardner
certainly.
there's
a
presence
of
collateral
attacks,
new
evidence
if
there
was
suppressed
evidence,
but
this
case
presents
the
flip
side
of
the
factual
scenario
i
started
with,
where
there's
been
a
finding
of
insufficient
evidence,
and
the
question
is,
finding
by
the
appellate
court,
does
that
finding
have
any
finality?
the
question
in
this
case
is,
does
double
jeopardy
prevent
the
state
from
going
in
and
relitigating
the
case.
mr.
clifford
gardner
he
could
seek
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
or
if
the
trial
court
still
had
jurisdiction,
perhaps.
there
are
collateral
attacks
that
could
be
made
on
that
sentence,
absolutely.
mr.
clifford
gardner
there
is...
under
the
double
jeopardy
clause
the
state
has
no
right
to
collaterally
attack
or
direct
attack
the
judgment
of
acquittal.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
that's
right,
because
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
there
is
no
right
to
appeal
a
jury's
finding,
or
a
jury
verdict
of
acquittal.
what
the
question
really
gets
at
in
this
situation
is
the
tension
i
think
that
the
court
addressed
in
burks
v.
united
states,
the
possible
distinction
between
a
judgment
of
acquittal
by
an
appellate
court
and
a
judgment
of
acquittal
by
a
jury.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
for
purposes
of
the
distinction
between
an
appellate
court's
finding
and
a
jury
verdict,
the
distinction
that
the
court
was
referring
to
in
burks,
the
question
is,
should
those
two
be
treated
differently?
there
may
be
other
reasons
why
a
sentence
enhancement
trial
is
not
subject
to
double
jeopardy
and
we're
certainly
going
to
talk
about
those,
i--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
suspect,
but
for
purposes
of
the
distinction
between
a
trial
acquittal
and
an
appellate
acquittal,
burk
suggests
that
there's
no
rational
reason
why
there
should
be
a
difference.
in
both
situations
the
treatment
should
be
the
same,
otherwise
the
petitioner
or
the
appellant
is
arbitrarily
deprived
of
some
right
simply
because
the
trial
level
fact-finder
made
the
wrong
call.
mr.
clifford
gardner
that's
correct.
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes,
it...
i
agree.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
certainly
wouldn't,
or
certainly
not
here.
that
would
not
be...
under
the
court's
precedents
double
jeopardy
plainly
does
not
apply
to
decisions
made
at
traditional
sentencing
hearings.
mr.
clifford
gardner
that's
not
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes.
in
all
respects
the
sentencing
in
this
case
is
identical
to
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence...
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
notice,
the
right
to
confrontation,
the
right
to
a
jury
verdict--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--well,
i
don't
agree
with
the
predicate
that
california
was
foolish
for
doing
it.
i
think
there
were
sound
policy
reasons
that
the
legislature
had
for
giving
these
rights.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
don't
view
it
as
punishing
the
state.
this
is
the
argument
that's
been
made
by
some
of
the
amicus,
the
so-called
no
good
deed
goes
unpunished,
which
is
certainly--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--then
i'm
sorry
i
suggested
it.
[laughter]
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
certainly
perhaps
3
weeks
ago
i
could
have
made
a
different
argument.
in
light
of
almendarez-torres
i
don't
think
i'm
in
a
position
to
make
that
argument,
and
so
i'm
not
going
to
make
that
argument.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
a
state
elects
to
treat
this
just
as
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence,
then
there
are
some
consequences,
because
when
the
state
is
enacting
this
legislation
there
really
are
two
models,
generally,
in
criminal
law.
we
have
the
traditional
guilt-or-innocence
model,
which
has
all
the
rights,
all
the
constitutional
rights
that
typically
attach
to
such
proceedings,
and
we
have
traditional
sentencing,
and
the
legislature
in
this
case
did
not
choose
the
traditional
sentencing
model,
which
we--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--no,
and
i--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
if
i
did,
then
i
misspoke.
what
i'm
suggesting
is
that
as
a
practical
matter,
when
you
look
at
the
statutes
that
the
states
have
enacted,
when
you
look
at
50
statutes
as
to
sentence
enhancements,
what
you
see
is
state
legislatures
choosing
from
two
models.
now,
i
agree
they
don't
have
to,
but
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
what
we
see.
we
see
either
a
selection
of
a
trial
model
with
all
the
rights,
or
we
see
selection
of
a
traditional
sentencing
model.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
don
think
so,
and
let
me,
if
i
can,
take
them
one
at
a
time.
as
to
the
first
point,
the
point
that
although
the
jury
is
making...
the
fact-finder
is
making
a
binary
determination
ultimately
there's
discretion
at
sentencing
to
choose
from
among
the
various
sentencing
options--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--well,
with
respect
to
all
sentence
enhancement
allegations
in
california,
whether
it's
a
current
conduct
enhancement
such
as
firearm
use
or
great
bodily
injury,
or
a
strikes
allegation,
there's
a
right
to
a
jury,
and
the
jury,
or
the
judge
if
a
jury
is
waived,
is
the
fact-finder
for
purposes
of
making
the
determination
as
to
whether
the
state
has
presented
in...
sufficient
evidence.
mr.
clifford
gardner
after
the
fact-finding
stage,
where
the
jury
or
the
judge,
if
a
jury
is
waived,
makes
the
determination
that
yes,
the
firearm
use
has
been
proved,
or
yes,
the
strike
allegation
has
been
proved.
the
judge
has
discretion
under
california
law,
under
section
1385,
to
dismiss
that
in
the
interests
of
justice.
that
may
be
what
your
honor
is
referring
to.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
actually--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--actually,
under
california
law
it
isn't,
judge...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor...
because--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--it
isn't
because
what
we
see
in
trials
on
substantive
offenses
in
california
is
that
very
same
power
under
section
1385.
that
in
no
way
distinguishes
a
trial
on
a
sentence
enhancement
allegation
from
a
trial
on
a
substantive
offense
under
california
law.
mr.
clifford
gardner
the
judge,
under
california
law,
can
dismiss
any
allegation
in
the
interests
of
justice.
mr.
clifford
gardner
so
in
that
sense--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--yes.
you
may
be,
your
honor,
but
i
have
forgotten.
[laughter]
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes.
as
to
the
first
of
those,
there
is
discretion,
when
we
come
to
sentencing,
for
the
trial
court
to
choose
among
the
appropriate
sentences,
and
yes,
that
is
not
a
binary
decision.
that
is
the
traditional,
normative
decision
that
is
made
at
sentencing
hearings,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
for
a
moment
double
jeopardy
applies
to
that
situation.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
in
the
separate
hearing,
and
often
it's
combined
directly
with
the
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence,
when
the
jury
has
reached
a
verdict
on
a
firearm
use
allegation
or
on
a
strike
allegation,
that
binary
determination,
yes,
the
defendant
had
a
gun,
no,
the
defendant
didn't
have
a
gun,
or
yes,
you've
proven
the
strike,
no
you
didn't,
it's
that
binary
determination
to
which
double
jeopardy
applies.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
think
as
a...
as
a
matter
of
the
facts
of
bullington,
it
turned
out
that
they
were
the
same,
the
jury's
sentence,
both
on...
the
factual
determination
and
the
sentence
was
the
same,
but
i
think
that
the
critical
component,
if
i
had
to
break
them
out,
would
be
the
binary
determination
of
fact
that
was
made,
and
that's
made
here.
it's--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--if
almendarez-torres
had
been
decided
differently,
or
perhaps
not
been
here,
i
probably
would
have
placed
a
greater
significance
on
the
fact
that...
the
additional
exposure
to
punishment
that
a
client
faces
under
a
three
strikes
or
a
firearms
allegation
is
so
high
that
that
in
itself
should--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
i
agree,
and
that's
precisely
the
argument
i'm
trying
to
make.
mr.
clifford
gardner
then
let
me
state
it
now,
if
i
haven't
before.
the
label
that's
attached,
whether
it's
enhancement,
or
whether
they
call
it
trial,
is
of
no
moment
to
the
double
jeopardy
analysis.
what's
important
in
the
double
jeopardy
analysis
are
three
things.
does
the
fact
expose
the
defendant
to
additional
punishment,
does
it
have
the
hallmarks
of
trial,
particularly
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
is
it
a
binary
determination?
mr.
clifford
gardner
the
hallmarks
of
trial,
of
course,
stems
from
bullington.
mr.
clifford
gardner
the
exposure
to...
the
fact
that
exposes
to
additional
punishment
really
stems
from
some
of
the
due
process
cases
this
court
has
now--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--no.
i
think
one
of
the
problems
with
some
of
the
double
jeopardy
cases,
or
the
analysis,
is
that
there
are
a
number
of
different
policies
on
which
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
implicated,
so
it
isn't
always
possible
to
rely
on
one
case
to
establish
or
set
forth
a
framework.
i'm
trying
to
pull
from
the
court's
precedents
what
i
see
happening,
and
that
is,
in
the
due
process
cases,
specht,
and
chandler,
and
chewning,
the
court
said,
this
is
a
new
fact
that
exposes
you
to
additional
punishment,
so
we're
not
going
to
treat
it
like
traditional
sentencing,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
take
that
analysis
into
the
double
jeopardy
context,
because
at
some
level
i
think
it
makes
sense.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
i
don't
think
pearce...
pearce--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--yes.
i
have
no
problem
with
that.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
pearce,
of
course,
is
what
the
state
is
suggesting
here
is
that
despite
the
fact
that
it
had
one
full
bite
at
the
apple
and
presented
insufficient
evidence,
which
is
conceded,
they
get
another
trial.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
that,
too--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--well,
i
agree,
it
is
crucial,
and
that's
why
the
first
part--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--no.
mr.
clifford
gardner
because
although
the
sentencing
guidelines
are
a
way
to
increase
punishment,
it
increases
it
within
a
previously
prescribed
range.
in
no
way
can
a
sentencing
guideline
finding
expose
the
defendant
to
punishment
in
addition--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--no.
actually--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--if
i
expressed
that
view,
then
again
i
misspoke.
mr.
clifford
gardner
no,
i
think
the
difference
is
this.
as
i
understand
the
sentencing
guidelines,
what
they
do
is
assist
the
judge
in
selecting
a
sentence
from
among
a
previously
prescribed
range
of
sentences.
that's
what
they
do,
as
opposed
to
the
distinction--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--that's
part
of
the
difference.
mr.
clifford
gardner
that's
part
of
the
difference.
mr.
clifford
gardner
that's
the
first
part.
the
second
part
is
that
my
understanding
of
the
sentencing
guidelines
is
that
none
of
them
have
the
hallmarks
of
trial
in
the
sense
that
there's
no
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
the
difference
isn't
between
a
statute
and
a
regulation,
and
i'm
not
suggesting
for
a
moment
that
the
california
system
of
what
we
call
determinate
sentencing
level,
where
the
judge
chooses
from
2,
3,
or
4
years,
where
choice
is
within
that
previously
prescribed
range,
are
subject
to
double
jeopardy.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
very
separate
factual
determination
which
exposes
someone
to
25
years
to
life
in
addition
to
that
4
years,
that's
imposed
on
top
of
the
4
years
and
that
could
not
be
imposed
in
the
absence
of
a
finding,
that
binary
determination
is
subject
to
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
clifford
gardner
actually,
i'd
rather
not
express
an
opinion
on
that.
[laughter]
mr.
clifford
gardner
that's
certainly
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
double
jeopardy
typically
would
not
apply
to
sentences.
there
are
some...
it's
difficult
for
me
to
answer
the
question
in
the
absence
of
knowing
why
it's
back
there.
if,
for
example,
it's
back
there
because
defendant's
appeal
took
longer
and
he
got
a
new
trial--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--you
can't
do
that
under
california
law,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
certainly,
i
think
that
there's
a
component
of
finality
in
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
i
think
it's
the
primary
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause,
but
putting
together
this
court's
decisions
in
bullington
and
difrancesco,
i
think
what
we
get
is
that
one
of
the
things
the
double
jeopardy
clause
protects
is
the
reasonable
expectation
of
the
finality
of
the
parties.
on
difrancesco,
the
court
looked
at
the
existence
of
a
statute
which
said,
you
can...
government,
you
have
the
right
to
appeal
a
sentence.
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
it
was
a
guilty
plea
to
assault
and
the
proof
deficiency
requires
a
brief
understanding
of
the
particular
allegation
at
issue
here,
and
that
is,
in
defendant's
current
offense
he
was
charged
with
having
committed
the
prior
assault,
but
that
does
not
expose
one,
under
the
california
scheme,
to
additional
punishment.
what
exposes
you
under
the
california
scheme
as...
what
triggers
the
strike
provisions
if
you
have
a
prior
assault
is
the
question
of
whether
you
used,
personally
used
a
weapon
in
that
prior
assault.
mr.
clifford
gardner
in
the
original
assault?
mr.
clifford
gardner
it
was
not
either
charged
or
established
from
the
records
of
the
prior
conviction,
and
that
was
the
proof
deficiency
in
this
case,
to
just--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--the--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--the
prosecutor
slipped
here
because
what
the
prosecutor
introduced
was
a
four-page
document
that
did,
indeed,
show
that
the
defendant
was
convicted
of
assault
in
1992.
what
the
prosecutor
did
not
show
is
any
documentation
or
any
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
defendant
personally
used
a
weapon.
mr.
clifford
gardner
now,
under
california
law
the
state
has
a
limited
universe
of
places
to
provide
that
information,
or
to
seek
that
information,
called
the
record
of
conviction,
so
the
state
would
have
had
to
look
in
the
record
of
conviction
to
see
if
there
was
documentation
to
establish
that
in
the
1992
assault--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--yes.
the
transcript
of
a
preliminary
hearing,
if
it's
a
guilty
plea
situation,
if
it
goes
to
trial--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--well,
if
the
pieces
of
paper
that
your
honor
is
referring
to
were
admissible
and
if,
indeed,
they
contained
the
information
that
was
necessary
to
cure
the
insufficiency--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--if
the
question
is,
was
the
1992
assault
conviction
from
the
same
superior
court
in
the
current
case,
i
don't
know
the
answer.
but
the
earlier
question
is,
was
it
just
a
piece
of
paper,
i
mean,
i
suppose
one
can
say
that
in
any
insufficiency
situation,
is
that
it
could
have
been
easily
proven.
i
don't
know
the
answer
as
to
whether--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--ultimately,
that's
the
evidentiary
failure
in
this
case.
mr.
clifford
gardner
the
question
as
to
whether
defendant
committed
a
1992
assault
was,
indeed,
established
by
the
state.
the
only
question
was
whether
he
personally
used
a
weapon,
and
the
state
introduced
no
evidence
to
that.
your
question--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--yes.
mr.
clifford
gardner
okay,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
clifford
gardner
first,
the
fact
that
there's
no
objection
does
not
in
any
way
undercut
the
state's
burden
to
prove
the
charge
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that
ultimately
is
the
question.
the
reason
the
court
of
appeal
correctly
held...
and
respondent
has
never
even
disputed
the
insufficiency,
your
honor...
is
that
an
assault
finding,
even
if
it's
with...
even
if
it's
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
doesn't
mean
personal
use,
because
there's
always
the
factor
of
aiding
and
abetting.
you're
just
as--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--that
part
was
never
established,
your
honor,
at
this
trial,
absolutely
not.
in
an
informal
colloquy
before
the
hearing,
the
prosecutor
said
to
the
judge,
well,
judge,
you
know,
this
was
a
single
defendant,
but
that
was
never
introduced
into
evidence.
mr.
clifford
gardner
the
issue
is
whether
defendant
personally
used
a
weapon
during
the
assault.
mr.
clifford
gardner
well,
if
we
had
those
two
things--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--i
will
answer
that
question,
but
we
don't
have
those
things,
because
at
the
first
hearing
the
state
introduced
no
evidence
that
a
stick
was
used.
remember,
what
happened
at
that
first
hearing
was,
the
judge
said,
i'm
going
to
take
judicial
notice
of
the
conviction,
and
the
conviction
was
for
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
that,
in
and
of
itself
under
california
law
in
over
a
decade,
does
not
provide
sufficient
evidence,
because
there
could
be
aiding
and
abetting,
someone
else
could
have
used
the
weapon,
or
there
could
have
been
an
infliction
of
great
bodily
injury.
then
the
court
said,
is
there
any
other
evidence?
the
prosecutor
said
yes,
i
have
a
piece
of
evidence.
i
have
exhibit
1.
that
showed
that
the
defendant
had
been
convicted
of
assault,
but
it
did
not
provide
any
evidence
that
a
stick
was
used
or
that
defendant
was
the
one
who
used
it.
that
was
never
introduced
into
evidence
at
the
first
hearing,
and
that's
why,
under
state
law,
the
california
court
of
appeal
held
there
was
insufficient
evidence,
after
the
attorney
general
conceded
it
on
appeal,
your
honor.
mr.
clifford
gardner
yes,
that's
not
so.
there
was
nothing
else
presented,
your
honor.
the
four-page
prison
package
showed
nothing
but
that
defendant
was
convicted
or
pled
guilty--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--well,
it's
a
prison
package,
and
it
comes
from
the
prison.
it's
not
like
the
prosecutor
crafted
it
for
this
case.
it's
a
standard
document.
it
has
finger
prints,
often
has
finger
prints,
it
has
a
picture,
it
has
the
nature
of
the
conviction,
sometimes
it
has
the
prison
of
commitment...
it's
a
standard
package
not
crafted
for
this
case.
mr.
clifford
gardner
beyond,
in
this
case,
penal
code
section
245(a)(1),
i
believe
was
the
provision,
which,
of
course,
is
not
sufficient
in
and
of
itself
and
that's
why
we
have
this
finding
by
the
state
court
of
appeal,
that
was
agreed
to
by
the
attorney
general
and
has
never
been
contested,
of
insufficient
evidence.
i
did
want
to
briefly
talk
about
one
of
the
other
purposes
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause--
mr.
clifford
gardner
--there
was
no
argument
on
insufficiency
of
the
evidence,
but
under
state
law
that
is
not
necessary
to
raise
insufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
appeal,
which
was
done,
and
the
court
of
appeals
said,
you
know,
by
gosh,
you're
right,
there
was
insufficient
evidence.
so
there
is
no
question
as
to
whether
defense
counsel,
under
california
law,
has
to
raise
a
sufficiency
argument
at
trial.
he
or
she
does
not.
i
did
want
to
talk
briefly
about
one
other
of
the
policies
underlying
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
as
this
court
noted,
i
think
in
burks,
one
of
the
other
chief
policies
is
the
idea
of
preventing
the
state
from
refining
its
evidentiary
presentation
in
successive
trials,
and
that
policy
is
directly
implicated
in
this
case,
because
after
all,
what
did
the
state
get
from
the
court
of
appeal
in
this
case?
they
got
a--
