mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
believe
the
court
should
not
extend
bullington
v.
missouri
beyond
capital
sentencing.
it
should
instead
reaffirm
the
well-established
rule
that
the
pronouncement
of
sentence
in
noncapital
cases
is
not
accorded
the
same
finality
as
an
acquittal
of
substantive
criminal
charges.
bullington
turned
on
two
factors,
each
of
which
was
essential
to
the
outcome.
first,
the
sentencing
proceeding
at
issue
had
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
second,
the
ordeal
and
anxiety
posed
by
capital
sentencing
are
uniquely
severe
and
invariably
as
great
as
those
posed
by
a
typical
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence.
that's
not
the
case
with
noncapital
sentencing,
so
a
bar
on
resentencing
is
not
warranted.
the
court's
cases--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--that
they're
uniquely
severe,
and
invariably
as
great
as--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--it
still
is
not
a
choice
between
life
and
death.
the
prisoner
in
all
those
cases,
his
life
is
not
at
stake,
and
it
wouldn't
make
sense
to
look
at
each
particular
sentencing,
at
each
particular
sentencing
procedure
to
evaluate
not
only
whether
it
has
the
hallmarks
but
also
whether
the
anxiety
is
so
great
that
it
ought
to
trigger
double
jeopardy.
that
would
be
an
administrative
nightmare.
the
court's...
besides,
the
court's
cases
make
clear
that
the
central
purpose
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause
is
to
protect
defendants
against
being
repeatedly
subjected
to
the
ordeal
and
anxiety
of
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence,
and
against
the
risk
of
erroneous
conviction,
not
to
guard
against
repeated
sentencing.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
we
would
contend
not,
although
there
might
be
an
argument
that
under
the
collateral
estoppel
line
of
double
jeopardy
that
we
would...
that
the
state
would
be
bound
in
future--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--they
wouldn't
be
bound
necessarily,
because
there
would
be
a
question
of
whether
this
determination
in
the
sentencing
context
has
all
the...
you
mean
not
as
a
constitutional
matter?
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
that
would
be
a
rule
of
state--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--i
think
that
it's
the
case
with
sentencing
determinations
like
this,
and
recidivist
determinations,
that
it's
a
new...
that
the
state
has
a
new
chance
to
establish
that
true
finding.
it
has
been
traditionally
the
case
that
that
would
bind
the
state
in
future
cases.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
my
understanding,
from
what
the
california
supreme
court
stated
to
be
the
rule,
is
that
that's...
that
the
case
with
recidivist
findings
is
that
the
findings
may
be
alleged
again
in
future
proceedings.
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
there
certainly
might
be
limitations
under
the
due
process
clause
on
what
would
be
permissible,
but
that...
you
know,
obviously
that's
not
the
question
here.
that
hasn't--
mr.
matthew
d.
roberts
--correct,
it's
not
this
case,
justice
kennedy,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
expectation
of
finality
that's
created
only
goes
so
far
as
the
state
law
that
creates
it.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
rule
advanced
by
petitioner
that
trial-like
hallmarks
at
sentencing
automatically
triggers
a
bar
on
resentencing
places
too
little
value
on
society's
interest
in
accurate
and
appropriate
punishment,
and
too
great
a
value
on
defendant's
interest
in
finality.
and
it's
been
pointed
out,
it
might
discourage
states
from
providing
procedural
protections
at
sentencing,
because
they
wouldn't
be
free
to
do
so
without
also
triggering
double
jeopardy
protection.
finally,
just
to
briefly
address
the
issue
that
came
up
on
the
question
of
almendarez-torres.
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
it
hasn't
been
argued
here,
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate...
for
the
same
reason
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
have
a
rule
that
triggered
double
jeopardy
by
the
procedural
protections,
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
have
a
rule
that
said
that
the
state
has
to
make
things
an
element
of
the
offense
when
it
decides
it
wants
to
provide
certain
procedural
protections,
because
that's
forcing
it
to
trade
off
its
interests
in
accurate
and
appropriate
punishment
against
its
decision
to
afford
defendant
certain
protections
to
make
the
sentencing
proceeding
more
fair.
in
essence,
the
reading
of
bullington
that's
advanced
by
petitioner
here
is
as
unworkable
and
unwise
as
it
is
unwarranted
by
precedent
and
principle,
and
we
would
ask
that
the
court
should
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court.
