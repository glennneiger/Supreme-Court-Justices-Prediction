unknown
speaker
could
you
in
other
states,
or
is
that
a
peculiarity
under
california
law,
or
is
this
just
a
rule
of
finality
that
prevails,
you
think,
in
most
jurisdictions?
you
just...
no
way
to
reopen
it?
unknown
speaker
newly
discovered
evidence,
can't
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
any
number
of
collateral
attacks
might
be
possible.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
california
have...
in
your
first
hypothetical,
assuming
you
lose
and
you
find
there
was
something
wrong,
there
was
not
really
a
prior
conviction,
there's
no
motion
to
modify
the
sentence?
after
the
court
has
affirmed
the
conviction,
the
man
has
served
for
a
year,
and
all
of
a
sudden
we
find
out
that
the
three
strikes
isn't
right,
he
can't
go
into
the
superior
court
in
the
state
of
california
and
ask
for...
to
modify
the
sentence?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course
the
state
can't
collaterally
attack
the
sentence.
the
state
is
bound
by
what
happens
on
direct
review.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
state,
there's
simply
no
proceeding
available.
if,
say,
the
jury
acquits
your
client
there's
no
proceeding
available
whereby
the
state
could
appeal
and
say,
probably
because
of
double
jeopardy,
that
this
was
a
wrong
result.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
it's
not
just
a
judgment...
you're
saying
that
a
judgment
of
acquittal
is
the
same
thing
as
a
sentencing
determination.
unknown
speaker
i
hope
you
will,
yes.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
historically
i
guess
we
have
not
thought
that
sentencing
aspects
are
covered
by
the
double
jeopardy
clause
for
most
crimes,
have
we?
unknown
speaker
and
if
there
were
a
judge
imposing
a
sentence
in
a
case
and
imposes
it
and
then
the
defendant
who
is
sentenced
appeals
on
the
ground
that
the
judge
imposed
a
sentence
not
authorized
by
law
and
prevails,
then
i
suppose
it
would
be
remanded
for
resentencing.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
be
arguing
double
jeopardy
here.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
but
you
say
that
this
is
different
because
of
the
special
procedures
that
california
employs
in
the
context
of
this
sentencing.
unknown
speaker
california
was
foolish
to
provide
those
protections.
you're
saying
california
should
have
simply
left
it
up
to
the
judge
to
find
those
aggravating
factors
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
in
that
case
if
the
judge
was
reversed
you'd
be
able
to
send
it
back
and
have
it
found
again,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
your
argument
is
so
counterintuitive,
that
the
more
protection
the
state
gives
to
the
defendant
the
worse
shape
the
state
is
in
as
far
as
being
able
to
resentence
if
it's
overturned
on
appeal.
why
do
you
want
to
punish
the
state
for
being
more
concerned
about
the
prisoner's
rights,
and
instead
of
letting
the
judge
find
it
by
a
preponderance,
saying,
we're
going
to
insist
that
it
be
found
by
a
jury
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
of
that.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
accepting...
you
are
accepting
that
california,
unlike
the
death
situation
where
there
has
to
be
a
procedure
to
present
the
mitigators
and
the
aggravators
and...
that
for
this
kind
of
sentencing
it
isn't
required
to
have
a
trial-type
hearing
at
all?
unknown
speaker
you're
conceding
that?
unknown
speaker
but
why
is
the
state
locked
into
two
models?
why
can't
a
state
say,
look,
we
want
to
give
him
some
kind
of
hearing,
but
we
don't
want
it
to
be...
we
don't
want
to
get
into
the
bullington
mode,
so
are
you
really
saying
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law
the
state
is
frozen
into
that
stark
choice?
unknown
speaker
either
give
him
no
hearing,
or
give
him
the
full-dress
hearing
with
the
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
but
this
isn't
exactly
one
or
the
other,
is
it,
because
although
you
said
in
a
conclusory
way
a
moment
ago
that
this,
in
fact,
is
the
choice
of
the
trial
model,
there
are
at
least
two
respects
in
which
it's
different
from
the
usual
trial
model
and
different
from
what
was
involved
in
bullington.
number
1,
although
in
one
respect
there
is
a
so-called
binary
choice
here,
the
binary
choice
nonetheless
operates
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
in
which
there
is
the
traditional
judicial
discretion
to
set
the
base
sentence
upon
which
the
binary...
the
multiplier
will
be
applied
and
number
2,
as
i
understand
it
in
this
case
the
state
has
an
appeal
which
the
state
does
not
normally
have
in
the
traditional
model,
so
we're
somewhere
in
between,
it
seems
to
me,
here.
unknown
speaker
and
in
fact
i...
perhaps
i
didn't
speak
properly
on
that.
the
discretion
is
even
greater
than
that,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
is
it
the
judge
or
the
jury
that
can
decide
for
policy
reasons
that
in
fact
the
so-called
strike
scheme
shouldn't
apply?
one
of
them
can.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't...
even
beyond
sufficiency
of
evidence,
isn't
there
also
a
discretionary
element
somewhere?
unknown
speaker
okay.
that's
a
much
broader
discretion
than
we
find
in
any
trial.
unknown
speaker
normal
trial
scheme.
unknown
speaker
don't
worry,
i
don't
regard
it
an
insult.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
if
someone
is
charged
with
armed
robbery
and
the
case
is
proved
and
so
on
the
judge
can
say,
well,
i
think
in
the
interest
of
justice
this
should
be
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
really.
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
we're
back
to
my
original
two.
i
put
you
off
your
argument.
we're
back
to
my
original
two,
the
two
distinctions
from
the
normal--
unknown
speaker
--okay.
fair
enough.
i
said
there's
discretion
in
the
sentencing
function
in
deciding,
sort
of
the
basic
sentence
to
which
the
multiplier
will
be
applied,
and
secondly
there's
a
state
appeal.
unknown
speaker
okay,
so
in
fact
you're--
--in...
go
ahead.
i
was
just
going
to...
you're
arguing
for
something
a
little
different,
i
guess,
from
what
was
involved
in
bullington,
because
i
thought...
i
thought
in
bullington
the
sentencing
proceeding
was
regarded
as
one,
in
effect,
unitary
proceeding,
and
you're
now
saying,
well,
there
are
two
subparts
of
the
sentencing
proceeding.
double
jeopardy
applies
to
one
but
not
to
the
other.
may
i--
unknown
speaker
--may
i...
excuse
me.
i
thought
you
were
through
with
your
answer.
may
i
ask
you,
if
you
can
do
it
in
just
a
sentence
or
two,
because
i
don't
want
to
take
too
much
of
your
time,
to
state
the
argument
you
would
have
made
if
we
hadn't
decided
almendarez
the
other
way
a
few
days
ago?
unknown
speaker
and
it
cannot
be
imposed
unless
this
critical
finding
is
made
by
the
fact-finder.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gardner,
even
though
almendarez-torres
has
been
decided,
isn't
it
possible...
all
that
said
is
that
recidiv...
it
doesn't
say
that
recidivism
laws
must
be
nonelements.
it
just
says
that
they
may
be,
and
isn't
it
open
to
us
to
find
that
even
if
the
state
calls
it
a
sentencing
enhancement,
if,
in
fact,
it
is
treating
it
with
a
separate
jury
trial
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
finding
and
what-not,
in
fact
it's
not
just
a
sentencing
enhancement.
in
fact,
the
state
is
treating
it
as
an
element
of
the
offense,
and
if
it
is
an
element
of
the
offense,
then
by
reason
of
normal
double
jeopardy
principles
and
not
the
invention
of
some
new
double
jeopardy
application
to
things
that
aren't
elements
of
the
offense,
your
client
would
be
entitled
not
to
be
tried
again.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think
you
made
the
argument...
no,
you've
never
come
out
and
confronted
the
state
and
said,
even
though
they
say
it's
an
enhancement,
it's
not
an
enhancement,
it's
actually
an
element.
unknown
speaker
now,
what's
your
authority
for
those
three
propositions?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
not
relying
on
any
one
case,
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what
do
you
do
with
a
due
process
case
like
north
carolina
v.
pearce?
unknown
speaker
pearce
says
you
can
get
a
tougher
sentence
on
resentencing.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
the
only
difference.
pearce
also
didn't
involve
a
sentence
that...
a
fact
that
increased
the
sentence
to
which
the
defendant
was
exposed.
it
was
all
within
the
range
of
the
original
crime.
unknown
speaker
that's
crucial,
that
if
you're
going
to
say,
even
though
this
looks
like
an
enhancement,
it
smells
like
an
enhancement,
it's
not
an
enhancement.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
say
not
only
because
we
gave
it
a
jury
trial,
but
also
because
the
effect
of
the
fact
found
is
to
increase
the
criminal
liability
of
the
individual.
unknown
speaker
wait
a
minute.
i
don't
understand.
why
isn't...
this
charming
book
is
the
sentencing
guidelines.
let's
imagine
that...
federal...
it
has,
let's
say,
800
or
1,000
different
factors.
why,
in
your
view,
is
it
the
case
that
all
of
these
findings
that
the
judges
make,
of
course,
are
yes
or
no.
i
mean,
they
did
it
or
they
didn't.
there's
a
lot
of
enhancements
in
there
and,
moreover,
the
judge
makes
it,
and
then
the
person's
exposed
to
higher
punishment.
in
your
view
the
double
jeopardy
clause
apply
to
each
of
those?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
oh,
so
if,
in
fact,
this
book
had
been
enacted
by
congress
rather
than
delegating
the
power
to
the
agency,
i.e.,
the
commission,
then
in
your
view
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
apply?
unknown
speaker
then
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
you
did.
i'm
trying
to
understand
why
not.
unknown
speaker
it
says
in
the
statute...
it
says
in
the
statute,
say,
zero
to
20
years,
and
within
that,
these
are
factors,
and
you're
saying
it's
the
zero
to
20
years
that
makes
the
difference.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
else?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
has
never
been
decided,
i
mean,
i
think
in
this
court.
in
this
court
it
hasn't.
the...
all
right,
hall...
all
right.
now,
in
california,
my
understanding
is
that
california
did
try
to
adopt
a
system
that
they
intended
to
be
like
the
sentencing
guidelines,
but
instead
of
doing
it
through
delegation
to
a
commission,
what
they
did
is
the
set
of
statutory
provisions
that
we
have
here.
they
give
three
choices,
they...
you
know,
they
have
low,
medium,
and
high,
they
build
all
the
things
into
the
statute,
just
as...
that's
my
correct
understanding,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
why,
if
this
is
constitutional,
should
the
effort
to...
without
double
jeopardy,
why
should
the
effort
of
the
state
legislature
to
do
roughly
the
same
kind
of
thing
through
a
set
of
statutes
suddenly
expose
a
person
to
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
me--
--mr.
gardner,
you
don't
think
that
this
court
would
have
permitted
judges
to
participate
in
the
drafting
and
promulgation
of
the
guidelines
if
they
were
functionally
the
same
as
legislation,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
that's
relevant
to
this
case,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this.
going
to
the
discretionary
law,
the
trial
judge
says,
i've
weighed
all
of
the
factors
and
i'm
giving
you
a
sentence
of
5
years,
4
years
later,
after
he
has
only
1
year
left,
under
a
state
procedure
it
comes
back
before
the
trial
judge,
he
says,
i've
changed
my
mind.
i
think
i
was
wrong
the
first
time.
you
really
should
have
8.
there's
no
finality?
there's
no
double
jeopardy?
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
it's
final,
but
the
judge
just
said,
i'm
going
to
retain
jurisdiction
in
this
case
to
think
about
this
a
little
longer,
and
he
waits
4
years.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
assuming
that
you
have
some
state
procedure
where
this
happens.
i'm
trying
to
ask
whether
or
not
there...
double
jeopardy
doesn't
have,
in
your
view,
some
component
of
finality,
so
that
the
defendant
is
not
subject
to
the
anguish,
the
agony
of
having
to
go
back
before
a
sentencing
judge
and
think
he
might
get
more.
unknown
speaker
mr.
gardner,
it
would
help
me
to
put
a
little
flesh
on
these
bones
and
to
tell
us
exactly
what
was
the
proof
deficiency
here.
it's
a
little
fuzzy.
i
mean,
it
was
a
prior
conviction
based
on
a
guilty
plea,
right?
unknown
speaker
to
a
crime
called
what,
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon?
unknown
speaker
wasn't
that
charged
as
part
of
the
indictment
in
that
prior
crime?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
would
it
have
taken
to
supply
the
deficiency?
it
was
something
about
there
only
being
four
pages,
or...
i
forgot
exactly
what
it
was,
but
i
was
trying
to
figure
out
where
the
prosecutor
slipped
here.
it
didn't--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
and
where
would
that
document,
documentation
have
come
from?
unknown
speaker
what's
in
the
record
of
conviction,
the
transcript
of
the
evidence?
unknown
speaker
which
this
was.
this
was
a
guilty
plea,
so
i...
there
were
some
pieces
of
paper
that
were
missing,
right,
that
the
prosecutor
didn't
put
in,
and
if
he
had
put
in
those
pieces
of
paper
there
would
have
been
no
problem,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
were
they
records
of
the
very
court
that
we
were
dealing
with,
or
was
there
some
other
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
can't
be
easily
proven
if
there's
a
presumption
of
innocence
that
applies.
you
presume
a
man's
innocent
till
there's
evidence
to
the
contrary,
and
there's
no
evidence
to
the
contrary
here.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
there
was
proof
of
a
prior
assault,
that
there
was
proof
of
that.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
fact
that
the
lawyer
didn't
contest
it?
i
mean,
the
lawyer
didn't
say,
he
didn't
personally
use
it.
the
lawyer
said,
a
stick
isn't
a
deadly
weapon,
so
no
one's...
no
one's...
there's
a
charge,
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
it's
introduced
by
the
state
as
a...
the...
you
know,
to
satisfy
the
requirement,
which
is
what,
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
that
you
use
personally?
unknown
speaker
and
then
there
is
no
objection
on
the
ground
of
personal
use.
there's
objection
only
on
the
ground
that
a
stick
isn't
a
deadly
weapon,
so
why...
i
never
understood
why,
given
that
circumstance,
the
california
intermediate
court
could
have
held
that
there
wasn't
enough
evidence.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
was...
it
was
a
single
defendant
case.
i
mean,
that
much
was
established,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
what
was
introduced
into
evidence,
the
issue
is
whether
there
was
an
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
personally
used
a
weapon.
now
we
have
the
following.
he
was
convicted
of
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon.
that's
introduced.
second,
the
weapon
involved
was
a
stick,
and
now
the
question
is,
those
two
things,
do
they
permit
someone
to
conclude
that
he
personally
assaulted
a
person
with
a
deadly
weapon,
particularly
because
nobody
denies
it.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
have
those
three
things--
unknown
speaker
--but...
so
what
exactly
was
presented?
it
was
more
than
a
guilty
plea
to...
there
was
more
information
that
simply
that
the
defendant
had
pled
guilty
to
assault,
is
that
not
so?
unknown
speaker
does
it
take
four
pages
to
say--
unknown
speaker
--and
there
would
be
no
description
of
the
crime
beyond
assault?
unknown
speaker
and
there
was
an
objection
to
that
evidence
being
insufficient
at
the
sentencing?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
gardner.
your
time
has
expired.
mr.
glassman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
would
you
agree,
then,
that
it
would
be
a
limitation,
based
on
the
rule
as
we
would
understand
it,
if
we
go
back
to
bullington?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
say
that
in
the
light
of
difrancesco,
because
difrancesco
wasn't
a
capital,
and
if
it
had
been
the
capital
versus
noncapital
character,
difrancesco
would
have
been
distinguished
right
then
and
there.
on
the
other
hand,
that
isn't
what
this
court
did.
this
court
distinguished
it
on
characteristics
of
the
sentencing
proceeding,
so
it
seems
to
me
that
at
least
through
difrancesco
that's
not
the
way
we
were
viewing
it.
unknown
speaker
your
position
is
that
it
was
bullington
that
was
a
departure
from
the
line
of
cases
like
stroud.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
question,
mr.
glassman?
this
case
happens
to
involve
an
enhancement
because
of
a
prior
act
of
the
defendant
that
was
not
actually
proven.
if
the
enhancement
had
been
based
on
the
use
of
a
gun
instead,
would
your
argument
be
precisely
the
same?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you
could
answer
the
argument
yes
or
no,
and
i'm
not
quite--
unknown
speaker
--i
want
to
be
sure
i
get
what
your
answer
is.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
thought.
unknown
speaker
now,
you
don't
rely
on
the
fact
that
it...
this
might
be
characterized
as
a
recidivism
case,
as
distinct...
as...
with
any
special
weight
in
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
right,
but
if
you
relied
just
on
that,
and
we
only
decided
that,
then
it
would
leave
open
the
question
whether
your
statute
would
be
valid
as
applied
to
use
of
a
firearm,
for
instance.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
the
question
that's
missing
here
is
he
was
not
proven
to
be
guilty
of
precisely
what
needed
to
enhance,
and
in
another
example
he
might
not
have
been
proven
guilty
of
using
a
firearm,
if
you
call
it
an
element
of
the
offense
rather
than
an
enhancement.
unknown
speaker
yes,
before
you
get
back
into
the
facts...
i
would
like
to
hear
your
view
of
it,
but
it
seems
to
me
you've
overstated
what
we've
held.
we
haven't
held
that
recidivism
does
not
raise
double
jeopardy
concerns.
we
have
held
that
if
a
recidivist
statute
is
not
an...
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense,
if
it
treats
recidivism
as
an
enhancement,
that
is
constitutional,
but
we
haven't
said
that
every
recidivism
statute
is
automatically
an
enhancement,
nor
have
we
ever
said
that
for
purposes
of
the
federal
constitution,
it
is
an
enhancement
simply
because
the
state
chooses
to
call
it
an
enhancement.
and
what
you
have
here
is
a
situation
in
which
the
state
calls
it
an
enhancement,
but
both
its
effects
and
the
trappings
with
which
the
court
surrounds
it
do
not
look...
it
doesn't
walk
and
talk
like
an
enhancement.
it's
just
called
that.
unknown
speaker
but
you
wouldn't
deny,
would
you,
that
if,
in
fact,
the
existence
of
the
three
pre-existing
felonies,
if
the
fact
that
they
exist
of
a
certain
sort
or
not,
if
each
of
those
were
an
element
of
the
offense,
then
i
take
it
you
would
not
deny
the
applicability
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
if
the
offense
were
the
offense
of
the
underlying
ones,
plus
felony
a,
plus
felony
b,
plus
felony
c,
that's
called
superoffense.
under
those
circumstances,
i
take
it
the
double
jeopardy
clause
would
apply.
that's
not
a
hard
question.
i
mean,
the
answer's
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
i
think
it
would
be
yes,
too.
has
anyone
in
this
case
at
any
level
ever
argued
that
these
extra
three
elements
are...
the
three
felonies
are,
in
fact,
elements
of
the
offense?
unknown
speaker
i
know
he's...
i
know
what
he's
arguing,
and
i
asked
him
if
he--
--justice
breyer
asked
you
a
question
that
i
think
could
be
answered
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
i
asked
you,
has
it
ever
been
argued
that
these
three
things,
the
three
extra
felonies
of
a
certain
kind,
their
existence,
that
the
need
to
have
them
is
an
element
of
the
offense?
unknown
speaker
i'm
asking
if
in
this
case--
unknown
speaker
--it
was
not
argued.
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
and
now
you
were
going
to
tell
us
what
this
deficiency
in
the
evidence
was
and
how
that
deficiency
could
have
been
supplied.
unknown
speaker
the
court
file
that
you
refer
to
is
something
different
than
what
mr.
gardner
referred
to
as
the
four-page
thing?
unknown
speaker
are
you
arguing
that
the
evidence
was
sufficient
to
sustain
the
trial
judge's
sentence?
unknown
speaker
but
you're
not
asking
us
to
review
that,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
by
state
courts,
by...
we
second-guess
the
state
court
on
its
application
of
its
own
law
to
the
facts
in
the
record
here?
unknown
speaker
mr.--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
justice
souter
wanted
to
ask
you--
--i
was
just
going
to
say
yes,
but
there
are
points
on
the
other
side,
too,
and
the
points
on
the
other
side
is
that
it's
a
fact
that
must
be
charged,
it's
a
fact
which
is
historical
in
nature
as
to
which
the
jury
has
to
say
yes
or
no,
it's
a
fact
that
has
to
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
these
in
fact
are
very
trial-like
determinations.
they're
very
element-like
determinations.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
it's
difficult
on
your
side
for
that
reason
to
say,
we
can
draw
an
easy
categorical
distinction.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
in
california,
for
example,
bullington
wouldn't
apply
because
the
sentencer
can
always
say,
well,
for
reasons
of
justice
i'm
not
going
to
apply
this?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
certainly
right
there.
going
back
to
an
earlier
colloquy,
if
the
argument
had
been
made
here
that
in
fact
that
was
an
element
because...
for
the
reasons
i
just
ticked
off,
it
seems
to
have
some
element
characteristics,
would
you
agree
that
there
might
be
a
reason
for...
a
very
good
reason
for
coming
out
against
you,
not
on
the
bullington
reason
but,
in
fact,
on
the
reasoning
that
what
is
really
being
charged
here
is
an
element,
whether
it's
called
that
or
not,
so
we
might
get
the
bullington
result
for
a
different
reason?
unknown
speaker
so
there's
just...
then
you're
saying
there's
just...
there's
always
a
categorical
distinction
between
offense
and
sentence
except
in
the
capital
area.
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
unknown
speaker
we
even...
our
terminology
even
suggests
that.
we
speak
of
innocence
of
the
death
penalty
as
though
that
particular
penalty
were
a
substantive
offense.
we
never
speak
of
innocence
of
any
other
sentencing
factor,
just
innocence
of
the
death
penalty.
unknown
speaker
but
teague
doesn't
apply
to
a
case
coming
from
a
state
court,
mr.
glassman.
unknown
speaker
although
they
may
elevate
it
to
being
an
element
of
the
crime,
in
which
event
they
would
elevate
it
to
all
the
other
things.
unknown
speaker
although
the
point's
been
made
that
that
argument
was
not
presented.
unknown
speaker
but
why
can't
i
answer
the
question
that
way?
the
question
presented
is,
does
the
double
jeopardy
clause
apply
to
noncapital
sentencing
proceedings
that
have
all
the
hallmarks
of
a
trial
on
guilt
or
innocence?
why
can't
i
answer
that
and
say,
yes,
when
those
hallmarks
in
their
context
demonstrate
that
what
was
at
issue
was
an
element
of
the
crime?
isn't
that
a
fair
way
to
answer
the
question
presented?
unknown
speaker
why
is
it
a
fair
element
if
it's
not
in
the
case,
elements
of
the
offense?
why
is
it
a
fair
reading
if
the
issue
of
elements
of
the
offense
is
not
in
this
case?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
glassman.
mr.
roberts,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
can
be.
i
mean,
you
say...
what
was
the
last
part
of
it,
that
the
consequences
are
just
as
severe
as
the
consequences
on
guilt
or
innocence?
unknown
speaker
invariably.
well,
okay.
not
invariably,
but
in
some
cases
the
so-called
enhancement
factor
can
up
the
ante
on
the
sentence
tenfold.
unknown
speaker
if
it
did
apply...
i'm
not
certain
of
the
answer
to
this.
i'm
having...
suppose
that
you
lost
this
case.
is
the
consequence
of
it...
i
can
see
the
consequence
of
it
would
be
that
when
a
person
appealed
and
lost
on
appeal
on
the
ground
of
insufficient
evidence,
you
couldn't...
you're
stuck
with
that.
is
there
any
other
consequence?
unknown
speaker
they
are
anyway,
aren't
they,
under
collateral
estoppel,
or
not?
i
mean,
if
a
state
tried
to
punish
a
person
again,
say
for
a
somewhat
different
crime,
but
there
was
a
factual
issue
that
was
identical,
the
same
issue,
aren't
they
bound
by
it,
or
not,
to
litigate
it
between
the
two
parties?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
mean...
you
know,
i
mean,
what
happens
if,
in
fact,
they
have
another
trial,
another
punishment,
another
sentencing
phase
on
a
different
matter,
and
it
turns
out
that
there's
a
factual
issue
that's
identical,
the
very
same
fact?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
don't
all
the
states...
do
they,
or
not?
how
does
it
work?
unknown
speaker
the
state
loses
the
first
time
in
the
sentencing
proceeding,
where
the
issue
is
what
happened
on
the
night
of
july
5,
1988,
at
6:00
in
the
morning,
did
he
have
a
gun
or
not,
and
then
he
commits
another
crime,
and
in
sentencing
it
becomes
relevant
again,
and
the
state
isn't
bound,
they
can
bring
it
up
again,
try
and
get
him
again?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
there's
a
due
process
clause
issue
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
difrancesco
talked
about
an
expectation
of
finality,
and
pointed
out
that
there
the
defendant
knew
that
there
was
a
proceeding
where
the
sentence
could
be
appealed
and
that
there
might
be
more
hearings,
but
if
you
have
a
procedure
in
which
the
sentence
is
final,
the
appellate
court
affirms
the
sentence,
and
then
there's
some
proceeding,
new
proceeding
to
reopen
it,
it
seems
to
me
that
that
does
maybe
indicate
that
an
expectation
of
finality
is
being
disappointed.
that's
not
this
case,
i
don't
think.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
