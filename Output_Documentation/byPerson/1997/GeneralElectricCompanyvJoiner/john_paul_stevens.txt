john
paul

--supposing
the...
the
scientist
test...
is
willing
to
testify
that
exposure
to
pcp's
for
an
hour
is...
that
1
out
of
a
thousand
people
will
get
cancer
from
that.
is...
that
would
be
admissible
under
your
view
in
the
environmental
case;
would
it
be
admissible
in
the
causation
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
is
the
threshold
that
there
is...
there
is
no...
no
probability
that
there
is
some
causal
connection
or
that
the
probability
is...
is
so
re...
so
remote,
1
out
of
100,000
cases,
then
it
doesn't
come
in,
but
for
1
out
of
a
thousand
it
does;
is
that
what
you're
saying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you're
suggesting,
if
there
had
been
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
the
man
smoked
or
had
any
family
history
of
cancer,
then
it
might
have
been
admissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
don't
know
what
ruling
he
might
make.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they
haven't
conceded
you
go
to
trial;
they
concede
there
need
to
be
further
proceedings
in
the
district
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gottesman,
as
you
understand
the
hard
look,
it
works
for
the
defendants
and
the
plaintiffs
equally,
whether
it's
admission
or
exclusion.
but
that's
not
the
way
i
read
judge
marquette's
opinion.
she...
she
relies
on
the...
the
presumption
in
favor
of
admissibility
in
the...
in
her
opinion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
so
you
don't
defend
her
reason
for
the
hard
look?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
gottesman,
it
seems
to
me
that...
that
maybe
the
methodology
prong
is
just
a
red
herring.
but
if
the
weight
of
the
evidence
is
an
accepted
methodology,
it
would
always
be
passed
that
threshold
if
the
expert
just
said,
i
considered
everything
and
came
to
this
conclusion.
