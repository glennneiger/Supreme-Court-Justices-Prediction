justice
antonin
scalia
let...
let...
let's
assume
that...
that
perfectly
reliable
scientific
methodology
was
used,
but
that
the
issue
is
whether,
given
that
methodology,
what
has
been
proven
is
sufficiently
relevant
to
this
case.
that
is,
whether
it
comes
close
enough
to
establishing
evidence
of
what
the
plaintiff
wants
to
prove.
the
district
court
could
simply
exclude
that
evidence,
i
suppose,
if
he
thinks
it
isn't
relevant
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
which
case
you
say...
in
which
case
you
say
he'd
be
reviewed
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
could,
on
the
other
hand,
let
it
in,
and...
and
simply
grant
summary
judgment
to
the
defendant
on
the
ground
that
not
sufficiently
relevant
evidence
has
been
produced
to
overcome
the
initial
burden
that
the
plaintiff
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
decision
would
not
be
reviewed
on
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
the
same...
it's
the
same
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
relevance
has...
has...
has...
i
don't
see
how
that
can
be.
whether...
whether
what
has
been
medically
proven
is
relevant
enough
goes
to
both
the...
the...
the
daubert
determination
and
to
the
summary
judgment
determination.
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
but
that...
that's
what
troubles
me
about...
about
this
case.
it
seems
to
me
things
are
getting
unduly
complicated,
when...
when
we
have
what
is
virtually
the
same
determinations
of
two
different
standards
of
review,
depending
upon
which
rubric
the
district
court
chooses
to
use.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
goes
to
the
summary
judgment
determination
and
not
to
the
determination
of
whether
it's
properly
admissible.
i
assume
it
is
properly
admissible
if
it...
if
it
goes
even
that
far,
even
a
little
bit,
to
render...
to
render
the
conclusion
more
probable
than
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
it
does
that,
it's
admitted.
but
i...
i
really
don't
understand
your
position
that...
that
somehow
environmental
cases
are
a
favored
class
of
cases
and
junk
science
is
okay
for
environmental
cases,
but
not
for...
not
for
an
ordinary
tort
suit.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
it's
good
for
one,
it's
good
for
both,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
summary
judgment
question,
not
the
admissibility
or
inadmissibility
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
other
categories
of
cases
besides
public
health
cases
and
environmental
cases...
they're
one
category...
and...
and
private
tort
cases
are
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
there
a
third,
fourth
and
fifth
categories?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
could
not
be
the
point.
he
is...
he
is
putting
the
summary
judgment
question.
you
are
saying
this
is
not
the
summary
judgment
question;
it
is
the
admissibility
question.
you
would
admit
that...
that
evidence
in
one
case
and
you
would
not
admit
it
in
the
other.
isn't...
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
and
it
seems
to
me,
the...
the
evidence
is
just
as
solid
scientific
evidence
in
both
cases.
but
it
isn't
helpful
to
the
jury.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
someone
ask--
--do
you
object
to
summary
judgment,
then?
i
mean,
if...
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--on
that
ground?
justice
antonin
scalia
that...
that
even
assuming
that
the
district
court
was
right
about
the
exclusion,
that
summary
judgment
still
should
not
have
been
granted?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
phrase
d.c.
circuit
cases
involving
review
of
administrative
determinations
which
are
supposed
to
be
made
on
an
arbitrary
or
capricious
basis,
equivalent
to
abuse
of
discretion
probably.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it
was
generally
agreed
among
administrative
law
pra...
practitioners
that
"hard
luck"
meant
not
arbitrary
and
capricious,
but...
but,
indeed,
a
different
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
almost
never
won
the
hard
luck
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so
we...
we
could
have
hard
luck
cases
and
lick
and
a
promise
cases,
right?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
this...
this...
this
assumes
that
in
other
cases
judges
just
sort
of
flip
through
the
record,
you
know,
fan
the
pages.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
shouldn't...
shouldn't
we
take
a
hard
look
in
all
cases?
why...
why
limit
a
hard
luck
to...
to
just
these
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
one
should
be
very
careful
in
every
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
live
in
an
ideal
world
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
excuse
me,
before
you
go...
are
you
saying
that
if
you
have
five
studies
that
do
not
show
a
statistically
significant
difference,
you
can
admit
all
five,
although
each
one
would
not
be
admitted?
is
that
what
the
weight
of
evid--
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
that...
that...
that
shows
that
the
district
court
was
relying
on
relevance
rather
than
methodology.
