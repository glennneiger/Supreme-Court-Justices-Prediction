justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
kuney,
the...
the
11th
circuit
said
that
the
standard
of
review
it
was
applying
was
abuse
of
discretion.
and
then
it
went
on...
this
is
on
page
4a
of
your
appendix...
a
district
court's
ruling
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence
is
reviewed
for
abuse
of
discretion.
and
then
it
gave
two
reasons
for
a
heightened
abuse
of
discretion.
and
one
of
them
was
the
showstopper
argument;
that
this
is
summary
judgment,
that
you're
out
of
court.
this
is
not
just
that
you...
you
missed
this
piece
of
evidence,
but
you're
out
of
court.
now,
isn't
that
just
across
the
board,
so
that
courts
will
look
more
closely
at
a
ruling
that
puts
a
plaintiff
out
of
court
than
one
that...
that
leads
to
summary
judgment...
than
one
that
is
maybe
a
question
of
does
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
come
in
or
out?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
isn't
it
true,
leaving...
leaving
the
field
of
expert
testimony,
as
a
general
rule,
that
a
court
will
look
more
closely...
a
court
of
appeals...
at
a
district
court
ruling
that
ends
a
case
than
one
that
merely
means
that
a
particular
piece
of
evidence
won't
come
in?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
that,
in
general,
when
you're
faced
with
a
summary
judgment
motion,
the
court...
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
look
at
it
from
the
vantage
point
most
favorable
to
the
opponent
of
the
motion.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
when
you
say
more
probable
than
not...
and
we...
we
have...
we
do
have
a
seventh
amendment,
we
do
have
questions
of
fact
that
go
to
a
jury...
so
this
gatekeeping
function
has
to
be
on
the
law
side,
otherwise
it
trenches
on
the
seventh
amendment.
so,
now,
when
you
talk
more
probable
than
not,
that
sounds
like
fact
territory
to
me.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gottesman,
i
think...
tell
me
if
my
understanding
is
correct.
she
said
this
man
wasn't
exposed
to
furans
and
dioxins.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
was
exposed
to
pcb,
but
not
furans
and
dioxins.
and
that
was
her
ruling
and
that's
why
she
looked
at
the
admission
only
with
respect
to
pcb.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then,
on
appeal,
you
got
her
reversed
twice.
you
got
her
reversed
for
saying
there
wasn't
enough
evidence
of
the
furans
and
dioxins.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
then
you
got
her
reversed
on
the
admissibility...
the
threshold
admissibility
question.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
lost
before
her
on
the
dioxins
and
furans.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
appealed
that
and
you
prevailed
on
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
the
piece
of
this
case
that
isn't
before
us,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
district
court,
on
remand,
might
say,
all
right,
i
was
wrong
about
the
plaintiff
not
having
been
exposed
to
furans
and
dioxins;
nonetheless,
considering
all
three
chemicals
together,
i
still
conclude
that
the
expert
testimony
should
not
be
admitted.
