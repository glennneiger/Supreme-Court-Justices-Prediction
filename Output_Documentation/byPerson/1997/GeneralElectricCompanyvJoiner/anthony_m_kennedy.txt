justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
all
disputed
issues
of
fact
are
taken
in
favor
of...
of...
of
the
moving
party?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
against
the
moving
party
in
the
court
of
appeals,
yes.
but
while
you
have
the...
the
appendix
handy,
could
you
look
at
judge
birch's
decision?
it's
at
page
16a.
and
he
has
the
first
three
or
four
sentences.
he
says:
the
role
of
the
trial
court,
following
daubert,
is
to
ensure
that
the
conclusions
reached
by
the
scientific
experts
have
some
minimal
level
of
reliability
and
probative
value.
i
take
it
you
have
no
argument
with
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
then...
then...
then
he
says:
this
determination
is
accomplished
by
establishing
that
the
predicate
principles
and
methodology
relied
upon
by
the
experts
are
valid
and
that
they
can
be
applied
to
the
facts
at
issue.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
also
in
accord
with
your
position?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
he
says:
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
and
the
weight
of
the
evidence,
however,
are
beyond
the
scope
of
the
daubert
analysis.
is...
is
he
mixing
apples
and
oranges
there,
or...
or...
or
is
he
correct
in
that
statement,
as...
as
well?
and
it
was
his
concern,
i...
i
think,
that
this
was
a
sufficiency
problem...
i
assume,
because
that...
that's
why
he
concurred.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
but
there's
an
element
of
sufficiency
in
the
calculus
that
you
want
the
district
judge
to
apply,
is
there
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but...
so
we
would
say
that
"weight"
and
"sufficiency",
as
used
here,
are
just
terms
of
art,
and
in
the
sense
that
we
usually
use
them,
they
do
not
apply
to
the
district
judge's
determination?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
in
that
process...
in
that
process,
do
they
consider
conflicting
expert
testimony,
so
the
defense
experts
advise
the
judge
of
why
they
think
the
methodology
is
flawed,
et
cetera?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
respondents
said
that
the
methodology
that
their
experts
used
and
that
was
rejected
was
the
same
methodology
that
your
experts
used.
is...
is
the
answer
to
that,
that
that
may
be
true,
but
the
methodology
lead
your
experts
to
conclude
that
there
was
no
cau...
causal
link
or...
i
mean,
i'm
not
quite...
quite
sure
how
to
respond
to
that--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well...
well,
is
there
something
to
be...
to
go
the
jury
still?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
no,
no.
if...
if
the
court
of
appeals
is
reversed,
and
if
the
district
judge's
order
is
upheld,
are
there
now
issues
to
go
to
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
if...
if
you
can't
show
causation,
why...
why
go
to
the
jury?
i
mean,
you
have
to
exposure,
plus
causation.
and
if
he
rules--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--that
you
cannot
show
causation
based
on
this
testimony,
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
i
still
find
that
hard
to
square
with
the
language
that
i
believe
justice
breyer
quote...
quoted
to
you.
and
it's
at
the
top
of
58a
of
the
appendix.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
said,
defendants
still
persuade
the
court
that
plaintiffs'
expert
testimony
would
not
be
admissible.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
you
proceed
to
the
trial
without
this
expert
testimony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
do
you--
--well--
--do
you
agree
that
the...
do
you
agree
that
the
district
court
must
inquire
both
as
to
the
adequacy,
the
soundness
of
the
methodology,
its
predictability,
and
the
relation
of
that
methodology
to
the
issues
before
the
jury?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
all
right.
and
the
experts
have
to
show
that
link
by
their
studies,
do
they
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
isn't
all
the
district
judge
did
here
was
to
find
that
there
was
no
link?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and...
and
that's
within
the
purview
of
the
district...
of
the
district
court,
if
the
district
court
is...
is...
is
correct.
if
he...
he
abuses
his
discretion,
or
her
discretion,
then
we
reverse.
but
that's
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
court,
is
it
not?
