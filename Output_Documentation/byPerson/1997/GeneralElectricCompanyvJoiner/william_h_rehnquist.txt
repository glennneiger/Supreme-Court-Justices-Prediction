we'll
hear
argument
now
in
no.
96-188,
the
general
electric
company
v.
robert
k.
joiner.
mr.
kuney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when...
when
you
say
abuse
of
discretion,
as
opposed
to
perhaps
de
novo
review,
mr.
kuney,
i
take
it
that
means
that
a...
a
properly
acting
district
court
might
have
reached
different...
different
conclusions
on
the
same
evidence,
and
both
would
be
affirmed
on
appeal?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
suppose
if
you
say
it's
de
novo
review
on
an
evidentiary
point,
there
would
be
a
lot
more
reversals
in
courts
of
appeals,
not
just
in
any
one
kind
of
case,
but
across
the
board.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly,
after...
after
daubert,
the
trial
judge,
the
district
court,
is
given
authority
to
exclude
evidence
on
the
basis
that
it
doesn't
comply
with
the
standards
laid
down
in
daubert,
i
guess?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is...
is
it
fairly
common
in...
in
cases
now
to
have
these
evidentiary
questions
of
admissibility
of
expert
testimony
thrashed
out
in
limine
or
be...
before
the
case
goes
to
trial,
and
then
have
a
motion
for
summary
judgment
based
on
the
court's
decision?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
mr.
kuney.
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
gottesman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
district...
the
district
court
did
grant
summary
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
there
would
have
to
be
some
sort
of
reversal
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
would
leave
something
left
for
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
is
it
on
page
20
that...
of
the
petitioner's
brief
that
you
say
is...
where
they
agree
with
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
crystal
clear,
but
per...
perhaps,
in
context,
it--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--mr.
gottesman,
getting
back
to
what
is
really
the
main
of...
of
the
petition
and
your
response,
i
guess,
if
you...
if
you
look
again
at
4a
of
the
petition,
where
the
district...
which
has
been
referred
to
by
my...
some
of
my
colleagues,
the...
the
court
of
appeals
says,
towards
the
bottom,
because
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
governing
expert
testimony
display
a
preference
for
admissibility,
we
apply
a
particularly
stringent
standard
of
review
to
the
trial
judge's
exclusion
of
expert
testimony.
do
you
agree
with
that
statement?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
the
page
are
you,
mr.
gottesman?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whereabouts
on
the
page
are
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
isn't
that
a
certain
amount
of
gobbledy-goop?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but...
but
you
think,
nonetheless,
judge
smith's
view
and
the
majority's
view
is
that
perhaps
the...
the
district
court
could
have
ruled
either
way
and
still
be
affirmed?
that's,
to
me,
what
abuse
of
discretion
means.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
not
always
certainly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
judge
smith,
of
course,
although
you
say
you
agree
with
the
standard
of
review
he
espoused,
said
he
would
have
affirmed
the
decision.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
"more
searching
review"...
when
you
say
"devote
more
resources",
would
it
comply
with
that
if
the
judges
on
the
appellate
panel
simply
say,
well,
i'm
really
going
to
go
over
this
record,
you
know,
and
i'm
going
to
read
it
twice,
perhaps--
[laughter]
--and
then
simply
apply
the
abuse
of
discretion
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--oh,
well,
wait
just
a
minute.
well--
--you
do--
--a...
a
hard
look...
it...
it's...
your
hard
look,
then,
is
limited
to
summary
judgment
proceedings?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if...
what
if
it...
it...
it
could
have
profound
impact,
i
take
it,
even
though...
supposing
that
the
trial
judge
excludes
important
evidentiary
testimony.
now,
that
doesn't
result
in
his
granting
a
judgment
for
the
defendant
at
the
end
of
the
trial,
but
it
has
a
significant
effect
on
what
you
can
argue
to
the
jury.
does
that
kind
of
a
ruling
deserve
a
hard
look?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
kind
of
harmless
error?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
and
i
take
it
the...
you
presented
all
this
argument
to
the
district
court,
the...
the
weight
of
the
evidence
and
that
sort
of
thing--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--that
the...
the
whole
equals
more
than
the
sum
of
its
parts,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
is
there
really
much
difference
between
the
first
and
second
position
that
you
just
described?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gottesman.
mr.
kuney,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
would
you
mind
telling
us
if
there's
something
left
here
to
be
tried
when
it
goes
back
and
whether
the
district
court
has
to
then
make
a
determination
whether
to
admit
expert
testimony
if
it
is
found
that
furans
and
dioxides
were
part
of
the
expos...
exposure?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kuney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
