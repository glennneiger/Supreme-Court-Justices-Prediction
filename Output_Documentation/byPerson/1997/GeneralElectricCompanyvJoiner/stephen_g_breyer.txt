justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--may
i
ask--
--i--
--well,
go...
go--
--i'll
just
take...
your
last
point
was
that
a
particular
study
might
show,
out
of
2.2
million
people
who
die
every
year,
a
thousand
die
of
chem...
cancer
caused
by
chemical
x.
that's
the
epa
study.
that
would
be
perhaps
ground
for
limiting
it.
it
wouldn't
be
ground
for
saying
that
this
person,
1
of
500,000
to
die
of
cancer,
died
of
chemical
x.
is
that
the
point?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
wondered
about
that.
what
i
read
the
district
court
saying
was...
he
said,
at
a
point
in
his
opinion,
assuming
that
plaintiffs'
experts
have
not
made
unfounded
assumptions
about
furans
and
dioxins...
that,
i
take
it,
is
on
the
assumption
that
he
thought
there
were
furans,
that
they
thought
there
were...
you
know,
that
there
were
furans
and
dioxins...
defendants
still
persuade
the
court
that
plaintiffs'
expert
testimony
would
not
be
admissible.
now,
he
doesn't
say
some
of
it.
he...
he
says
the
expert
testimony...
the
experts
who
are
going
to
testify
about
particular
things.
he
says,
assuming
i'm
wrong,
says
the
judge,
about
furans
and
dioxins,
still
it
would
not
be
admissible.
i
take
him
to
mean
what
he
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
didn't
see
any...
any
words.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
just...
oh,
the
only
words
that
i
found
relevant
were
the
words
that
i
read
to
you.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
are
there
some
other
words
there
that
are
relevant?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'll
go
back
and
look
again.
i
looked
through
the
record.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
i
just
found
a
motion
for
summary
judgment,
a
motion
to
exclude
testimony,
some
answers
to
it,
and
i
didn't
see
all
these
fine
distinctions
being
made
in
those
papers.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'll
go
back
and
read
them
again.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but,
i
mean,
normally,
as
a...
as
a
reviewing
judge
in
a
court
of
appeals,
i'd
look
at
the
summary
judgment,
i'd
look
at
what
the
motions
were
below,
i'd
look
at
what
they
actually
argued.
so
if
you
want
me,
i'll
go
back
and
do
that.
i'm
just
saying,
when
i
did
it
briefly,
i
didn't
notice
these
fine
distinctions
being
made.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and...
where,
in
other
words,
they're
saying...
you...
you
believe,
if
i
look
at
those
papers
again,
i'll
find
that
they
say,
oh,
no
matter
even
if
we
win
this
in
the
court
of
appeals,
we
concede
that
we
still
have
to
go
back
and
have
a
trial
on
the
furans
and
dioxins;
that
they
said
that
in
those
papers?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
the
court
of
appeals.
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
but
i'm
saying
whether
or
not...
you're
saying
now
that
somehow
this
case,
given
the
summary
judgment,
et
cetera,
they're
conceding
that
they
have
to
go
back
and
have
a
trial
on
furans
and
dioxins,
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
and
i'll
find
that
in
their
papers
before
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
you're
saying
they...
they're
conceding
that
it
would
be
admissible
in
respect
to
furans
and
dioxins
if
there's
an
issue
there,
but
not...
i
mean,
this
is
a
fine
distinction;
that's
why
i
looked
at
the
papers...
and
you're
going
to
tell
me
now...
perhaps
you
have
the
citation...
where
this
was
all
argued
before
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
kind
of
hypothesis.
isn't
it
even
narrower
than
that...
that
the
district
judge
has
not
yet
ruled
on
whether
the
testimony
would
be
admissible
if
the
record
showed
all
three
chem...
chemicals?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
when
i
used
to
be
on
the
court
of
appeals,
if
there
was
this
complicated
thing,
the
parties
had
to
point
it
out.
that's
why,
normally,
i
would
just
take
the
issue
of
unadmissibility
to
be
it's
inadmissible.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
there
is
this
distinction
made,
i
want
to
be
sure
i
focus
on
it
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
other
words,
you
asked
the
judge
this,
the
district
judge--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
he
didn't
make
a
ruling
on
it,
even
though
he
was
asked
to
make
a
ruling
on
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
he...
if
he...
he
granted
summary
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
made
a
ruling
of
inadmissibility.
that,
i
would
think,
would
be
the
end
of
it
normally.
i
don't
hypothesize
what...
what
he
would
have
done
on
something
that
nobody
asked
him
to
do.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
that's...
that's...
i'd
just
like
to
follow
up
on
the
chief
justice's
question,
because
that's
what
i
wasn't
certain
about.
are
you
saying
that
a
decision
to
exclude
evidence
or
to
admit
evidence
or
a
certain
sort,
an
appellate
court
does
the
same
job
with
it
all
the
time,
whether
it's
plaintiff's
or
defendant's,
whether
it's
admitted
or
excluded
prior
to
trial
or
after
trial,
whether
summary
judgment
is
at
stake
or
de
novo
is
at
stake,
are
all
those
to
be
the
same
in
your
mind,
or
are
you
saying
that
it's
different,
depending
upon
whether
the
trial
would
take
place
or
the
trial
was
over?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
so
that...
but
there
is
not...
that's...
that
you're
saying
is
true
whether
there
was
a
trial
or
wasn't
a
trial.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
summary
judgment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
just
a
fact
of
judicial
mentality--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
not
a
rule
of
law.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
well,
that's
the
part
i
don't
know
about.
because
once
you
articulate
it
in
a
rule
of
evidence
or
an
opinion,
it
becomes
a
rule
of
law.
and
i
don't
know
how
you'd
write
such
a
thing
into
a
rule
of
law.
how...
do
you
have
an
idea
for
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
it
sounds
as
if
he's
saying
the
studies...
i
mean,
i've
written
things
like
that
myself
a
lot.
you
go
through
seven
pieces
of
evidence
and
you
say
the
evidence
doesn't
support
it.
it
means
individually
or...
individually
or
taken
together.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
question
would
be,
has
he
abused
his
discretion
in
saying,
taken
together,
i
don't
think
these
studies
will
help
the
jury?
that's
what
he
said.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
think
they'll
help
the
jury
enough
to
award...
to
admit
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
are
we...
we're
supposed
to
assume
for
argument's
sakes
that
there
is
inadmissible...
because
one
of
the
points
you
raised
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
wrong
on
its
furans
point...
there
isn't
any
evidence
here
that...
that
there
were
furans
and
dioxins.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we're
supposed
to
assume,
for
purposes
of
this
case,
that
the
court
of
appeals
is
right
on
that
point.
so
the
bottom
line,
in...
in
your
opinion,
is
we
assume
they're
right,
we
remand
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
we
ask
the
court
of
appeals
to
remand
to
the
district
court
for
consideration
of
furans
and
dioxins;
is
that
the
bottom
line?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
see
any
evidence
here
on
furans
and
dioxins
on
either
side--
