mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
there
are
certainly
some
serious
disagreements
between
the
parties
here,
but
there
are
a
number
of
areas
of
agreement.
and
i'd
like
to
begin
with
those,
because
i
think
they
may
narrow
the
focus
of
the
very
questions
the
court
has
been
asking.
first
of
all,
i...
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear,
it's
only
a
piece
of
the
court
of
appeals
reversal
that
is
here.
that
is,
the
plaintiffs
contended
that
the
plaintiff
was
exposed
to
three
chemicals.
the
court
of
appeals
held
as
a
triable
issue
a
fact
on
that.
that
was
not
an
iss...
a
ruling
that
turned
on
the
admissibility
of
scientific
evidence.
and,
indeed,
as
respondents
acknowledge
at
page
20...
i'm
sorry...
as
petitioners
acknowledge
at
page
20
of
their
reply
brief,
the
district
court
has
not
ruled
the
expert
testimony
inadmissible
with
respect
to
all
three
chemicals.
so--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no,
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
respectfully,
that
that
is
what
he
meant.
what
he
said
was
the
experts
assumed
that
all
three
chemicals
were
present
and
that
plaintiff
was
exposed
to
them.
but
assuming
that
i
accepted
their
testimony
as
testimony
about
pcb
alone,
it
would
not
be
acceptable.
that's--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
let
me
make
clear,
the...
the
defendants
did
not
move
to
deny
the
expert's
testimony
on
all
three
substances.
indeed,
their
very
reason
for
arguing
that
you
can't
claim
cau...
that...
that
there
is
a
promotion
of
cancer
by
pcb
alone
is
that
the
studies
the
experts
were
relying
on
included
people
who
were
exposed
to
furans
and
dioxins.
and
said
they...
therefore,
if
we're
right,
that
this
plaintiff
was
not
exposed
to
furans
and
dioxins,
then
that
testimony
is
not--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
but
i...
i
ask
your
honor--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
i
think,
if
you--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--if
your
honor
will
just
look
at
page
20
of
respond...
of
petitioner's
reply
brief,
they
expressly
say
the
district
court
did
not
rule
on
the
admissibility
of
the
testimony
with
respect
to
three
chemicals.
and
i
tell
you--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--pardon...
well,
absolutely.
because
now
the
court
of
appeals
has
found
there's
a
triable--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes,
indeed.
well,
that's
the
point
that
i
started
out
wanting
to
make.
the
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
that
said
that
there
is
a
triable
issue,
that
the...
that
mr.
joiner
was
exposed
to
dioxins
and
furans,
is
not
here.
respondent
acknowledges
that
at
page
20
of
his
brief.
that's
not
here
because
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
of
course--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--but
the
district
court
has
not
ruled
that
the
scientist's
testimony
is
inadmissible
if
it
is
assumed
that
mr.
joiner
was
exposed
to
all
three
chemicals.
the
district
court--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
of
course.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
on
their
reply
brief.
they
say...
this
is
in
the
first
full
paragraph...
the
court
of
appeals
added
that
it...
in
its
view,
there
was
a
genuine
factual
dispute
over
whether
furans
and
dioxins
could
have
been
present
in
the
fluid
to
which
mr.
joiner
was
exposed.
it
never
reached
the
question
of
whether
opinions
of
causation
by
furans
or
dioxins
would
be
admissible,
because
the
district
court
had
not
done
so.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
let...
let
me
back
up
for
a
minute,
because
this
is
just
terribly
important
to
us,
obviously.
they
moved
for
summary
judgment
and
they
made
two
points.
contrary
to
the
claims
of
the
plaintiffs,
mr.
joiner
was
not
exposed
to
furans
and
dioxins.
therefore,
they
said,
he
was
only
exposed
to
pcb's.
and
the
testimony
of
plaintiffs'
experts
wou...
is
not
admissible
on
the
basis
of
pcb
exposure
alone.
they
never
said
that
if
mr.
joiner
was
exposed
to
all
three
chemicals
that
the
testimony
would
not
be
admissible.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that
the
court
of
appeals
expressly--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
well,
you'll
find
it--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--in
their
papers
here.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
no.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
exactly.
there
is
nothing--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
that's--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
your
honor,
as
they
acknowledged,
the
district
court
never
ruled
on
the
admissibility.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
of
course.
and--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--he
was
not
asked
to
make
a
ruling,
because
they
did
not
contend
it
was
not
admissible.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's...
well,
he
was...
he
did
not...
it's
a
she...
the
district
judge
did
not
answer
the
question
of
whether
the
testimony
with
respect
to
all
three
chemicals
was
admissible.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
correct.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct,
your
honor.
as
is
the
testimony
of
the
experts
that
exposure
to
those
chemicals
promoted
the
cancer
that
mr.
joiner
experienced...
a
point
that
the
district
court
had
never
itself
ruled
on.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
that
is
a
possibility.
of
course,
the
defendants
have
never
argued
to
the
district
court
that
it
would
be
inadmissible,
assuming
all
three
were
there.
but
if
they
made
such
an
argument
and
if
the
district
court
were
willing
to
entertain
a
second
motion,
that
would
be
possible
there.
but
the
ruling
that
is
up
here
is
the
portion
of
the
court
of
appeals
ruling
that
says,
even
if
the
plaintiff
was
only
exposed
to
pcb's;
that
is,
even
if
the
jury
ultimately
determined--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that
the
plaintiff
was...
was
exposed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
not
as
it
is
precisely
stated.
and
i
want...
that's
part
of
where
i
said
there
is
some
agreement
between
the
parties
that
will
narrow
the
issues.
we
do
not
contend
that
there
are
two
different
tiers
of
abuse
of
discretion
review.
there
is
one
standard
of
review;
it
is
abuse
of
discretion.
we
also
do
not
believe
that
it
is
a
one-way
factor
whether
a
court
takes
a
close
look
at
a
case.
just
as
judge
becker
and
this
court
have
said,
that
when
evidence
in
a
daubert-type
proceeding
is
excluded,
we
ought
to
take
a
close
look,
judges
higginbotham,
in
the
fifth
circuit,
judge
buckley
in
the
d.c.
circuit,
and
a
third
court,
as
well,
have
said,
because
these
are
such
important
rulings,
these
rulings
inevitably
decide
the
fate
of
a
case
when
it's
a
toxic
tort
case;
because
expert
testimony
is
crucial
to
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
the
case.
these
are
not
just
ordinary
rulings.
these
are
really
important
rulings.
they
deserve
more
careful
attention.
and
what
we
argue
for
is
the
formulation
not
of
the
sentence
as
stated
by
the
majority,
but
actually
the
sentence
as
it
is
stated
by
the
dissenting
judge
in
this
case,
who,
on
this
point,
i'm
not
sure
was
disagreeing
with
the
majority.
what
judge
smith
was
saying...
and
it's
on
page
18
of
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition...
and
i'll
quote
it,
because
this
is
all
that
we
contend
for
as
to
the
appropriate
role
of
appellate
courts:
in
applying
a
particularly
stringent--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--pardon?
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
sorry.
this
is
the
last
paragraph
on
page
18a.
it
begins
the
paragraph.
and
on
this
point,
we
think
judge
smith
is
really
just
explaining.
he
says
he's
explaining
what
the
standard
is
that
the
majority
has
asserted.
in
applying
a
particularly
stringent
review,
we
do
not
change
the
threshold
of
review,
but
conduct
a
searching
review
of
the
record...
that
is,
take
a
hard
look...
while
maintaining
the
proper
standard
of
review.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
what
it
is,
is
saying
is
there
are
some
cases
where
we
are
going
to
devote
more
resources
to
analyzing
the
claim
that
a
party
has
brought
to
us;
that
there
has
been
an
abuse
of
discretion--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
in
appropriate
cases,
that
may
be
true.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
but...
and,
indeed,
the
court
said
this
is
not
such
a
case.
and
i
want
to
get
to
that
for
a
moment.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
correct.
and,
obviously,
we
don't
agree
with
that
portion
of
the
decision.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
we
are--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--okay.
we...
we
think
that
that
is...
that...
that...
we
think
this
and
only
this:
that
this
court
ought
not
to
tell
the
appellate
courts
at
this
stage
of
the
development
of
daubert
and
its
application
that
you
should
not
look
carefully
at
cases
where
these
things
come
to
you.
we
think
it's
important
that
they
do
look
carefully.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
as
the
chief
justice--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--of
course.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
indeed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
indeed.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
exclusion
or
the
admission
when
the
admission
also
means
that
a
trial
will
go
forward
that
otherwise
would
not.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that
is--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that's
all
we're
contending
for,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
would
say,
with
eyes,
but
yes.
[laughter]
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i
think,
realistically,
your
honor--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
your...
your
honor--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
and...
and
we
wrote
that
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
and
we
said,
in
an
ideal
world,
that's
what
appellate
courts
would
do.
but
as--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--but
as--
[laughter]
an
ideal
world,
with
limited
resources,
your
honor.
as
justice
o'connor
said,
judges
make
a
myriad
of
decisions
every
day,
and
they
have
to
make
them
on
the
spot.
and,
understandably,
courts
of
appeals
are
going
to
be
quite
deferential
to
those
rulings.
but
this
kind
of
a
ruling
is
not
made
that
way.
this
kind
of
a
ruling
is
made
on
an
elaborate
record.
now,
the
judge,
to
be
sure,
did
not
hold
a
hearing
here
or
even
receive
an
argument
from
the
lawyers,
but
the
judge
had
very
extended
papers
and
wrote
a
full
opinion.
and
this
was
something
which
was
not
just
one
of
those
snap
decisions
that
judges
have
to
make.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes,
i
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
and
so
we
are
not
defending
the
notion
that
it
should
be
limited
to--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--no.
we
would
put
together
the...
the
views
of
judge
becker
on
the
third
circuit
and
judge
marquette,
which
is
that
when
you
exclude
it
in
a
case
like
this,
it
deserves
the
hard
look--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--with
the
views
of
judge
higginbotham
and
judge
buckley
and
others
that
when
you
admit
it
in
a
case
where
it
makes
the
whole
difference
between
a
trial
or
not,
we
should
look
at
it
more
closely.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
it's
limited
to
evidentiary
rulings
which
have
a
profound
impact
on
the
case.
the
most--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i
would
think
not.
certainly,
it
is
not
as
strong
a
case
for
one
as
one
where
the
judge
says
this
case
is
over
and
it's
over
now;
i'm
granting
summary
judgment
because
of
the
ruling
that
i
make.
and
i
also
think
the
fact
that
daubert
is
a
new
and
difficult
enterprise
for
courts
suggests
some
more
room
for
appellate
observation
of
what's
happening
and...
and
elaboration.
and
let
me--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--i
think
that
i
am
saying
something
that's
in
between
those.
that
is,
that
appellate
courts
should
be
free,
when
they
feel
a
really...
a
ruling
was
really
important
to
the
outcome
of
the
case,
to
look
closely
at
the
claims
of
the
parties.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
that's
right.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
exactly.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
what
we
are
articulating
is
not
a
legal
principle;
it
is
a...
an
observation
about
the
allocation
of
appellate
resources,
which
judges
now,
on
five
circuits,
have
felt
it
important
to
articulate.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i'm
not
sure
that
it
should
be
written
as
a
rule
of
law.
that
is,
i
think
that
these
courts
of
appeal
should
be
allowed
to
say
this,
and
that
you
should
not
be
offended
that
they
say
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
harmless
error.
[laughter]
not
error.
harmless
non-error,
your
honor.
now,
what
i'd
like
to
do--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
let
me
address,
your
honor,
the
application
in
this
case...
what
it
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
actually
complained
about
that
the
district
court
did,
which
we
believe
is
a
ruling
of
legal
error
and,
thus,
not
affected
by
that
sentence.
and
the
solicitor
general,
in...
in
his
brief,
also
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
believed
that
it
had
found
a
legal
error.
to
understand
it,
i
have
to
spend
1
minute
setting
out
what
the
methodology
is
that
the
experts
were
employing
in
this
case,
and
then
how
the
district
court
decided
the
case.
the
experts
were
applying
a
methodology
which
is
well
established
in
the
scientific
method.
it
is
known
as
the
weight
of
evidence
methodology.
that
is,
in
areas
where
science
has
not
arrived
at
absolute
certainty,
how
do
we
make
probablistic
estimates
of
whether
something
is
causing
or
contributing
to
an
injury
or
not?
and
there
are
well-established
protocols
for
this.
they
were
developed
initially
by
scientists
at
the
epa,
and
were
then
peer
reviewed
by
university
and
industry
scientists
and,
ultimately,
published
as
the
epa's
guidelines.
there
are
similar
guidelines
for
the
world
health
organization,
also
developed
by
scientists.
and
there
is
a
prescribed
protocol
that
one
uses
in
going
about
a
weight
of
the
evidence
methodology.
if
you
look
at
the
district
court's
opinion...
and
this
is
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
it...
nowhere
does
the
district
court
acknowledge
that
the
methodology
being
used
here
is
weight
of
the
evidence
methodology.
nowhere
does
the
district
court
said,
it's
wrong
to
use
that
methodology
here.
nowhere
does
the
district
court
said,
well,
it
was
right
to
use
that
methodology,
but
you
didn't
apply
it
properly
here.
instead,
all
that
the
district
court
did
was
say,
bring
on
your
individual
pieces
of
evidence
one
at
a
time.
i
will
look
at
each
one
under
the
microscope.
i
will
decide
whether
you
can
go
to
a
jury
on
a
claim
that
this
piece
of
evidence
causes
or
promotes
lung
cancer
in
smokers.
and
if
you
look,
for
example,
she
started
with
the
evidence
of
animal
studies.
and
she
discussed
that
at
pages
58
to
62
in
the
appendix.
and
then
she
says,
no,
you
can't
find
it
from
the
animal
studies,
and
she
sweeps
them
off
the
table.
we
never
hear
about
them
again.
then
she
starts
with
the
epidemiological
studies,
the
human
epidemiological
studies,
at
least
two
of
which
found
statistically
significant
evidence
of
an
increase
of
lung
cancer
from
exposure
to
pcb's,
and
others
of
which
found
accelerated
incidence
of
lung
cancer,
even
though
the
sample
sizes
weren't
large
enough
to
find
statistical
significance.
she
critiques
each
of
those,
pushes
it
aside.
she
ignores
entirely
other
aspects
of
what
the
weight
of
evidence
methodology
requires.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
and
the
weight
of
evidence
methodology
contemplates
that.
statistical
significance
requires
confidence
at
an
extraordinarily
high
level.
it
does
not
correlate
with
the
likelier
than
not
burden
of
proof,
which
is
what
the
law
requires.
and
so,
scientists
have
written
extensively...
we
have
a
footnote
in
our
brief,
where
we
cite--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
exactly.
but
the
district
court
never
acknowledges
that
that's
even
what's
going
on
here.
the
district
judge
just
goes
through,
one
after
another,
the
individual
items
of
evidence.
and
then,
at
the
end,
says,
the
studies
simply
do
not
support
the
expert's
position
that
pcb's,
more
probably
than
not--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--well,
but
that's
a
ruling
on
the
sufficiency.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--okay.
here's...
the
court
of
appeals
said
two
things
about
that.
these
were
its
rulings
about
how
the
district
court
proceeded.
and,
incidentally,
the
district
court
ignored
much
of
the
evidence
that
went
into
the
weight
of
evidence
thing,
including,
for
example,
that
pcb's
are
ingested
and
the
place
in
the
body
where
they
locate
themselves
is
the
lungs.
that
is
where...
the
lung
tissue
is
where
pcb's
de...
deposit
themselves.
and
that
other
chemicals
that
are
similar
to
pcb's
have
been
found
to
have
high
incidence
of
lung
cancer.
the
dis...
the
district
court
ends
with
this
statement
that
i
just
read.
the
court
of
appeals
said
two
things
about
that.
number
one,
said
the
court
of
appeals,
you've
just
made
a
statement
about
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence.
you
have
not
said
that
science...
the...
the
scientific
methodology
is
improper.
you
have
not
cited
anything
that
suggests
that
scientists
are
not
allowed
to
take
this
body
of
evidence
and
get
to
this
conclusion.
you've
just
said
that
you
don't
think
you
can
get
from
this
body
of
evidence
to
this
conclusion.
and,
indeed,
that
is
exactly
what
did
happen.
because
the
defendants
introduced
no
scientist
who
said
that
the
plaintiffs
have
taken
steps,
that
it
is
impermissible,
applying
the
proper
scientific
method,
to
take.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
i
think
not,
your
honor.
and
let
me
suggest
why.
i
think
there
are
two
problems
with
that.
if
the
district
court
says
there
is
scientific
disapproval
of
this
step.
that
is,
the
scientific
methodology
does
not
permit
this
step
from
these
premises
to
that
conclusion.
that
might
be
a...
a
consideration
of
methodology.
but
the
district
court
did
not
say
that
and
could
not
say
that,
because
there
was
no
record
made
that
suggested
that
this
was
not
permissible
scientific
methodology.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
the
district
court
was
relying
on
sufficiency.
the
district
court
was
saying,
you
can
put
your
evidence
on,
but
i
don't
believe
it.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
the
district
court
said
there
is
no
link;
yes.
but
the
district
court
did
not--
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
--that
is
where
we
would
disagree,
your
honor.
and
that
is
where
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
as
daubert
makes
clear,
the
district
court
may
not
decide
whether
the
experts'
opinions
are
correct,
but
merely
whether
the
bases
supporting
the
conclusion
are
reliable.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
well,
i...
we
believe,
your
honor,
that
it
can
be
encompassed
within
the
methodology
inquiry
for
the
defendant
to
come
forward
with
scientific
evidence
that
says
you
can't
get
from
a
to
b...
not
just
that
i,
the
competing
scientist,
disagree...
because
scientists
disagree
all
the
time...
but
that
the
range
of
permissible
scientific
methodology,
that
which
is
regarded
as
good
science,
does
not
allow
you
to
go
from
a
to
b.
mr.
michael
h.
gottesman
yes.
and
let
me
give
you
one
very
good
example
of
that.
they
point,
in
their
reply
brief,
to
the...
the
testimony
of
some
of
their
witnesses...
none
of
whom
addressed
the
plaintiffs'
witnesses'
testimony...
and
say,
see,
this
shows
your
methodology
is
bad.
and
they...
several
of
the
examples,
on
page
12
of
their
reply
brief,
are
the
testimony
of
dr.
waddell
at
deposition.
dr.
waddell
was
asked
at
that
definition
with
respect
to
the
very
testimony
they're
citing:
is
the
view
that
you're
stating
here
widely
accepted
in
the
scientific
community?
this
is
on
page
269
of
the
joint
appendix.
and
his
response
was:
there
are
a
number
of
senior
scientists
who
see
it
the
same
way
i
do.
they
probably,
number-wise,
are
in
the
minority.
now,
that's
their
testimony:
the
view
i'm
expressing
here
is
probably
in
the
minority.
that's
what
they're
citing
to
show
that
our
scientists
were
not
following
the
scientific
method.
