mr.
kuney,
the...
the
court
of
appeals...
the
nub
of...
of
one
of
the
court
of
appeals'
points
was
that
the
district
court
had
focused
on
the
soundness
of
the
results
reached
by
the
various
studies
in
question
rather
than
the
methodology
and
the
general
acceptance
of
that
methodology.
if...
and
you
may
want
to
comment
on
whether
this
is
so
or
not...
but
if
the
district
court
did
not
make
it
clear
from
its
own
exposition
whether
it
was
focusing
on
results
rather
than
methodology...
if
there
is
an
ambiguity
there...
would
you
agree
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
resolve
that
ambiguity
in,
in
effect,
any
reasonable
way,
and
that
the
resolution
of
that
ambiguity,
in
deciding
whether
the...
the
lower
court
opinion
should
be
read
as
focusing
on
result
or
on
method,
is...
is
something
that
we
should
accept,
so
long
as
either
resolution
was...
was
reasonable?
that
itself
would
not
be
subject
to
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
would
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
though,
of
course,
we
wouldn't
have
taken
the
case
just
to
review
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
there
are...
there
are...
there
are
two
inadequacies
that
might
be
in
question.
one
inadequacy
might
be
the
court
of...
the
district
court
didn't
make
it
clear
which
prong,
as
it
were,
it
was
focusing
on.
the
second
inadequacy
might
be
that,
assuming
it
focused
on
the
correct
prong,
the
methodological
one,
it...
it
simply
did
not
do
an
adequate
job
of
justifying
its...
its
position.
and...
and
you're
saying,
i
guess,
that
there
should
be
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
when
the
court
of
appeals
reviews
each
of
those
two
different
kinds
of
questions?
justice
david
h.
souter
abuse
of
discretion,
with
teeth.
[laughter]
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
was
the...
was
this
a
methodological
conclusion
or
a
relevance
conclusion?
maybe
the
district
court
was
saying
the
methodology
is
fine
for
what
it
purports
to
do.
but
it
does
not
provide
a
sufficient
predicate
for
use
in
reasoning
to
a
conclusion
about
cause
in
humans.
maybe
that's
what
the
district
court
was
doing.
and
if
it
was
doing
that,
it
seems
to
me,
number
one,
that
was
not
committing
any
legal
error.
and,
number
two,
it
was
making
a
judgment,
ultimately,
about
what
the
jury
could
find
helpful
that
should
be
subject
to
abuse
of
discretion
review.
would
you
agree?
