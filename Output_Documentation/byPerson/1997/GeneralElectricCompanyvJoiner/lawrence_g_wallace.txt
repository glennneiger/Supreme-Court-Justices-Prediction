mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
gatekeeper
role
that
this
court
prescribed
in
daubert,
as
we
understand
it
and
as
the
terms
of
rule
702
suggest,
applies
to
the
testimony
of
the
expert
and
whether
that
testimony
should
be
allowed,
not
just
to
the
question
of
what
studies
the
expert
can
advert
to...
and
usually
these
are
studies
done
by
others,
not
by
himself...
but
what
he
can
say
about
those
studies.
part
of
the
scientific
methodology
is
scientific
reasoning,
what
conclusions
are
scien...
scientifically,
can
be
said
to
follow,
or
at
least
arguably
to
follow,
from
the
premises
one
has.
many
scientists
could
be
found
who
could
describe
published
studies
conducted
by
others,
but
the
experts
are
selected
by
the
parties
on
the
basis
of
what's
important
in
the
case,
what
inferences
they're
willing
to
draw
from
the
published
studies,
and
how
they're
willing
to
relate
those
inferences
to
the
case.
and
what...
what
counts
in
these
cases,
in
the
gatekeeping
function,
is
to
separate
what
is
scientific
reasoning
and
worthy
of
consideration
under
rule
702
from
what
is
not
supported
by
scientific
reasoning
and
relating
published
studies
to
the
issues
in
the
case,
and
therefore
should
not
be
submitted
to
the
jury.
that
is
a
question
based
on
what
is
proper
scientific
reasoning
rather
than
quite
the
same
legal
question
that
justice
scalia
was
adverting
to
in
what
is
sufficient
evidence
to
support
a
judgement.
and
this,
as
respondents
concede,
is
a
very
contextual,
fact-intensive
question.
we
point
out
in
foot...
footnote
8,
on
page
18
of
our
brief,
that
there
are
legal
situations
in
which
the
question
before
the
court
is
whether
there
is
a
risk
to
public
health
or
a
danger
to
the
environment,
including
a
danger
to
animal
habitats,
which
would
make
certain
studies
relevant
in
inferences
that
can
be
drawn
through
scientific
reasoning
to
the
ultimate
issue
in
the
case;
quite
a
different
ultimate
issue
from
what's
involved
here,
which
is
not
preventing
conduct
that
may
be
harmful
in
a
general
sense,
but
trying
to
determine
whether
it
is
more
probable
than
not
that
a
particular
person's
injury
was
caused
by
the
defendant.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
i...
i'm
not
saying
that...
that
that
is
the
question
for
the
judge
to
decide
in...
in
determining
admissibility.
that
is...
but
that
is
the...
the
question
that
is
before
the
jury,
if
the
case
goes
to
the
jury.
and,
therefore,
in
deciding
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
link
between
the
foundation...
the
premises
on
which
the
expert
is
to
draw
and
the
inferences
that
he
is
willing
to
draw
from
them
and...
and
put
before
the
jury,
one
has
to
keep
in
mind
what
it
is
that
scientific
reasoning
has
to
relate
to.
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the...
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we're
not...
i...
i
wouldn't
consider
what
i
was
referring
to
as
junk
science.
it...
it...
it
is
whether
there
is
a
sufficient
indication
that
a...
a
danger
to
the
public
health
should
not
be
risked.
that
is
quite
a
different
question--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the...
but
the
logical
extension
of
that
is
that
so
long
as
a
study
can
be
said
to
have
been
published
and
conducted
so
far
as
appears,
according
to
scientific
methodology,
any
study
can
be
admitted
in
any
case,
as
long
as
you
can
find
a
qualified
expert
who
is
willing
to
say
that
i
would
draw
a
conclusion
from
this
study
that
relates
to
this...
to
the
issue
before
this
case.
there's...
there
would
be
no
gatekeeping
at
all
to
exclude
studies.
and...
and
daubert
would
be,
essentially,
overruled.
the...
the
process
of
scientific
reasoning
in
drawing
inferences
from
studies
and
whether
there
is
too
great
an
analytical
gap
between
the
premises
and
the
conclusions
that
that
expert
is
going
to
testify
to
has
to
be
part
of
the
gatekeeping
if
it's
to
be
meaningful.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
not
at
all.
but
it...
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that's
only
part
of
the
context.
one
could
pose
a...
a
hypothetical
in
a
tort
case
where
there
had
been
an
epidemiological
study
that
provided
a
basis
for
linking,
in
a...
in
a...
the
cause
here
to
a
human
injury,
and
then
these
very
same
animal
studies
could
be
adverted
to
in
the
testimony.
one
could...
the
counsel
could
ask
the
expert,
well,
do
you
know
of
any
other
studies
relating
to
this
substance?
and
he
can...
could...
re...
refer
to
the
animal
studies,
and
then
explain
why
he
thinks
the
results
are
consistent
with
the
conclusion
that
he
draws
from
the
epidemiological
studies.
it
might
not
be
very
important
evidence,
but
it
would
be...
but
he
couldn't
draw
the
inference
that
the
district
court
found
not
to
be
supported--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
these
particular
animal
studies
showed
something
about
cause
of
a...
of
a
disease
in
humans.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that...
that...
that...
that
very
well
could
be
the
point.
you
have
to--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
it
has
to
be
evidence
that
would
assist
the
jury,
under
the
terms
of
rule
702--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--with
the
question
that
is
before
them.
it's
not
just
a
question
of
whether
it's
scientific.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i...
i...
i
think
that's
a
hard
question
to
answer.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that...
that...
and...
and
certainly
a
much
closer
question
than
what
was
before
the
district
court
here,
which
was
testifying
about
possible
effects
on
humans
from
animal
studies
involving
higher
doses
than...
than
would
have
been
involved
in
this
case.
there
has
to
be
some
threshold--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--where--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
would
say
that
that,
too,
is
a
contextual
question
that
has
to
be
answered
in
light
of
the
evidence.
we
happen
to
be
dealing
with
a
case
here--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
which
there
was
strong
evidence
of
other
causative
factors.
and
if
you
try
to
add
in
testimony
about
a
particular
chemical,
where
it's
only
1
in--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
certainly,
a
lower
threshold
would
be
appropriate
there
than
where
you've
got
a
slim
chance
that
the
chemical
caused
it,
and...
and
a
lot
of
evidence
of
other
things.
