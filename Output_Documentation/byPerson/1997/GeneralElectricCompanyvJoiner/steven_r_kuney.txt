mr.
steven
r.
kuney
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
arises
out
of
a
holding
by
the
court
of
appeals
that
a
particularly
stringent
standard
of
review,
and
not
abuse
of
discretion
or
manifest
error,
should
govern
appellate
review
of
district
court
decisions,
excluding
expert
testimony
under
rule
702
and
this
court's
daubert
opinion.
the
factors
that
this
court
has
considered
in
its
recent
standard
of
review
decisions
all
point
to
abuse
of
discretion
as
the
appropriate
standard
here:
the
broad
discretion
given
to
trial
courts
under
federal
rules
of
evidence
104(a)
and
702,
the
consistent
practice
before
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
deferential
appellate
review
of
decisions
admitting
expert
testimony,
and
the
clear
functional
advantages
of
the
trial
courts
in
making
these
intensely
fact-bound
determinations.
indeed,
the
conclusion
that
abuse
of
discretion
is
the
appropriate
standard
for
review
of
702
decisions
has
been
reached
by
no
less
than
10
courts
of
appeals.
notwithstanding
all
these
considerations,
the
court
below
embraced
what
it
called
particularly
stringent
review
for
decisions
excluding,
but
not
admitting,
expert
testimony,
citing
as
authority
its
reading
of
this
court's
daubert
opinion
and
the
third
circuit's
opinion
in
paoli,
which
had
called
for
a,
quote,
hard
look
at
exclusions
of
expert
testimony
that
rejul...
result
in
summary
judgment.
in
so
doing,
the
court
below
articulated
an
expressly
one-sided
standard
of
review,
whose
precise
scope
and
meaning
are
not
clear
and
whose
likely
and
perhaps
intended
effect
seems
to
be
to
discourage
the
exercise
of
the
discretion
inherent
in
the
gatekeeping
function
this
court
outlined
in
daubert.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
will.
i
think
it
makes
a
difference
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
i
think
that
part
of
respondents'
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
court
was
merely
ruling
on
a
matter
of
law,
and
never
had
occasion
to
apply
its
novel
standard
of
review.
i
think
if
one
looks
at
the
text
of
the
opinion
of
the
court
below,
particularly
at
10a
and
11a
of
the...
of
the
appendix
to
our
cert
petition,
and
takes
a
look
at
the
section
that
deals
with
the
reliability
of
expert
testimony,
what
one
sees
is
the
court
really--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--yes,
of
the--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--petition
to
the...
the...
the
appendix
to
the
cert
petition.
that's
where
we
attach
the
opinion
of
the
court
below.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
and
the
section
really
begins
at
the
bottom
of
10.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
what
one
sees
in
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
is
nothing
that
looks
like
abuse
of
discretion
review.
rather,
the
court
simply
proceeds
on
its
own
to
undertake
its
analysis;
indeed,
to
declare
in
the
first
paragraph
that
the
methods
and
procedures
used
by
these
experts
were
in
fact
reliable.
the
court
then
proceeds
to
basically
disagree
with
what
the
district
court
had
done
with
respect
to
animal
studies
and
epidemiolog...
epidemiological
data,
but
never
to
declare
or
find
that
the
court
abused
its
discretion
in
making
the
decisions
that
it
had
made.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
mr.
chief
justice,
i
believe
that
could
happen,
although
i
don't
believe
that
could
have
happened
in
this
case.
i
think,
on
the
record
here,
there...
there
would
have...
there
should
have
been
only
one
possible
ruling
by
the
district
court.
but,
as
a
general
matter,
it
is
absolutely
correct
that
abuse
of
discretion
suggests
a
range
of
decisions
that
district
courts
could
reach.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
i...
i
believe
that's
the
intention
of
those
who
articulated
this
standard...
in
fact,
was
to
invite
greater
appellate
reversal
of
district
court
decisions.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
on
these
evidentiary
points.
i
think,
in
particular,
if
you
look
at
judge
becker's
explanation
in
the
paoli
case,
of
why
he
embraced
this
hard
look,
he
expresses
the
concern
that
district
judges
are
going
to
get
it
wrong,
and
really
calls
for
the
necessity
of
greater
appellate
intervention
for
this...
with
respect
to
this
gatekeeping
function.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
justice
souter,
i
don't
believe
this
court
is
obliged
to
accept
the
court
of
appeals'
interpretation
of
what
the
district
court
was
doing.
in
response
to
the
first
part
of
your
question--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--what...
what
courts
of
appeals
often
do
in...
in
situations
where
there
is
abuse
of
discretion
review,
and
they
find
that
the
record
does
not
provide
what
the
court
of
appeals
believes
is
an
adequate
explanation
of
how
the
district
judge
exercised
his
or
her
discretion,
then
a
remand
for
a
better
explanation
from
the
trial
court
is
often
done.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
yes,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
i
think,
in...
in
a
number
of
cases,
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
abuse
of
discretion
as
the
standard
of
review
really
allows
the
appellate
court
full
rein
to
do
whatever
is
necessary.
it
can
always
correct
errors
of
law
under
an
abuse
of
discretion,
and
it
provides
the
appropriate
deference--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--i
think
courts
of
appeals
inevitably
make
judgments
about
how
much
of
their
time
and
attention
to
give
to
any
particular
question.
i
think
the
problem
here,
though,
is
that
by
suggesting...
by
using
language
that
suggests,
in
fact,
some
new
standard,
the
11th
circuit
is
suggesting,
really,
a
different
task
for
appellate
courts.
it,
on
the
one
hand,
does
embrace,
as
you
pointed
out,
abuse
of
discretion,
but
then
proceeds
to
say,
we
really
need
to
do
more
than
that.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
i...
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
have
not
allowed
that
to
lead
to
an
altered
standard
of
review.
i
think
there
are
a
variety
of
evidentiary
decisions
that
can--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--the
summary
judgment
motion
is
reviewed
de
novo.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
when
there
are
subsidiary
evidentiary
rulings
that
precede
summary
judgment,
those,
without
regard
to
what
rule
of
evidence
may
be
implicated,
are
reviewed
for
abuse
of
discretion.
then,
once
the
summary
judgment
record
is
established,
then
there's
de
novo
review
by
the
court
of
appeals
of
whether
summary
judgment
was
a...
was
appropriate.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
once
you're
beyond...
yes,
justice
kennedy.
once
you're
beyond
the
evidentiary
issue
and
to
the
summary
judgment
point,
then
there's
de
novo
review
if
the--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--that's
correct.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
yes.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
that's
how
i
would
read
that,
your
honor...
that...
that
he
thought
that
perhaps
what
the
district
court
had
done
was
to
slide
from
admissibility
into
sufficiency
without
clearly
articulating
that.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
well,
you
could
use
the
word
"sufficiency"
if
you
want
to.
but
i
believe
what
this
court
said
is
that
there
are
minimum
thresholds
of
reliability
and
relevance
that
have
to
be
met
before
the
testimony
is
admissible.
and...
and
i--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--that's
how
i
read
judge
birch...
birch's
concurrence;
that
he
was
recognizing
two
separate
issues,
and
perhaps
suggesting
that
there
had
been
some
confusion
between
the
two.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
correct.
and
the
court
still
has
the
ability,
even
if
it
determines
that
the
evidence
is
admissible,
to
find
it
insufficient
to
avoid
summary
judgment.
and
that,
i
believe,
is
part
of
what
this
court...
court
pointed
out
in
daubert...
was
that
the
admissibility
determination
was
not
necessarily
the
end
of
the
case.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
i
believe
that's
correct,
under
the...
under
the
"fit"
prong.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
correct.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
correct.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
that's
correct.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
i...
i
believe
it's
not
the
same
question.
i
believe
the
standards
that
you
have
set...
this
court
has
set
forth
under
rule
702,
for
determining
admissibility,
are
not
identical
to
the
standards
that
govern
a
sufficiency
determination.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
i
would...
i
would
agree
that
it's
pertinent
to
both.
but
i
don't
think
it's
clearly
the
case
that
the
standard
that
a
district
court
ought
to
use
in
making
those
decisions...
either
decision...
is
the
same.
i
believe
that
the
"fit"
prong
under
daubert
does
come
very
close
conceptually
to
what
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
seems
to
be
about.
i
certainly
would
concede
that.
and
i...
i
believe
that's,
in
effect,
what
you're
pointing
out--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--i
think
that's
really
no
different
here
than
in
any
other
area
that...
where
an
evidentiary
ruling
leads
to
summary
judgment.
in...
inevitably,
you're
left
with,
if
the
district
court
decides
the
evidentiary
ruling
adverse
to
the
plaintiff,
and
then
the
summary
judgment
decision
really
is
nothing
other
than
the...
the
cupboard
is
bare,
because
there
is
no
admissible
evidence,
then
there
is
de
novo
review
of
summary
judgment.
and
that,
admittedly,
is
not
a
very
intensive
exercise.
but
i
think
that's
not
a
problem
unique
to
the
admissibility
of
expert
testimony.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
absolutely.
the
courts
have...
have
really
developed
a
variety
of
procedural
vehicles.
in
some
circuits,
they
virtually
require
an
evidentiary
hearing.
in
other
cases,
it's
simply
done
by
motion.
but,
increasingly,
judges
are
resolving
these
issues
in
advance
of
trial,
both
to
decide
whether
summary
judgment
is
appropriate
and
so
that
before
the
trial
unfolds,
the
parties
will
know
what
evidence
is
going
to
be
before
the
factfinder
and
what
evidence
is
not.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
the
procedure
typically
involves
a
motion
in
limine
to
exclude
and
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
and
in
the
course
of
that
motion
in
limine
to
exclude,
the
party
seeking
the
exclusion
will
put
on
whatever
contrary
evidence
it
has
that
it
believes
identifies
the
methodological
flaws.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
justice
kennedy,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
the
methodology
used
was
not
the
same.
there
was
testimony
in
the
record
before
the
district
court
from
the
defense
experts
about
appropriate
methodology
with
respect
to
interpretation
of
animal
studies,
about
a
recognized
set
of
criteria
that
can
be
applied
to
a
variety
of
epidemiological
data
to
assess
causation,
and
there
is
no
overlap
with
respect
to
that
methodology
between
the
methodology
that
defendants
put
forward
and
the
methodology
of
plaintiffs'
experts.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
any
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
believe
it
is
technically
correct
that
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment,
the
only
argument
defendants
put
forward
about
furans
and
dioxins
was
that
there
had
been
no
exposure.
so
the
district
judge
was
not
asked
to
rule
upon
whether
opinions
that
accepted
that
exposure
could
meet
the
scientific
requirements
of
rule
702.
so
that
issue
is
left
before
the
district
court.
and
then,
if
there
is
a
trial,
if
the
district
court
decides
that
there
are
admissible
opinions
that
go
to
that
point,
it
will
be
a
very
different
trial
than
would
otherwise
take
place.
because
the
plaintiffs
would
essentially
have
to
win
in
front
of
the
factfinder
the
furans
and
dioxins
exposure
point
or
the
case
would
be
over.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
and...
and--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--that's
correct.
you...
you
could
in...
instruct
the
court
of
appeals
that
under
of
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
which
it
should
have
applied,
the
district
court's
exclusion
of
the
pcb
opinions
was
clearly
within
the
district
court's
discretion.
and
so
there's
a
reversal,
and
that...
that
opinion
of
the
district
court
ought
to
be
reinstated.
since
we
did
not
technically
challenge
the
furans
and
dioxins
exposure
point,
that
would
still
be
a
matter
appropriate
for
further
proceedings.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
well,
the...
the--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--the...
the...
the
complication,
justice
breyer,
is
that
the
opinions
of
the
experts,
in
fact,
were
necessary
to
the
conclusions
about
whether
there
was
exposure
to
furans
and
dioxins.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
that's
part
of
what
really
was
left
up
for
grabs
when
and
if
the
parties
return
to
the
district
court.
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
let
me
just
address
a
couple
of
points
very
briefly.
first,
the
notion
that
we
need
a
modified
standard
of
review
to
tell
courts
of
appeals
when
to
pay
attention.
it...
i
believe
it
does
con...
convey
the
suggestion
that
somehow,
under
normal
abuse
of
discretion,
courts
of
appeals
are
not
doing
their
job.
we
already
have
federal
rule
of
evidence
103,
which,
in
effect,
says
that
there
are
certain
evidentiary
rulings
that
don't
have
a...
an
impact
on
a
substantial
right
of
the
parties.
and
those
ought
not
be
the
grounds
for
error.
it
seems
that
that's
sufficient,
and
that
what
this
court
does
not
want
to
do
is
endorse
the
notion
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
some
kind
of
extra
language
or
extra
message
needs
to
be
given
to
courts
of
appeals
in
this
area.
you
con...
this
court
considered,
really,
a
very
similar
suggestion--
mr.
steven
r.
kuney
--thank
you,
your
honor.
