mr.
kuney,
even
if
you're
correct,
that
the
abuse
of
discretion
is
the
standard
of
review,
the
respondents
tell
us
that
we
still
would
have
to
affirm
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard,
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
this
case.
are
you
going
to
address
that
argument?
justice

10a
and
11a----
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--of
the
petition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
this...
you're
arguing...
arguing
for
a
standard
that
is
somewhat
different
than
the
ordinary
review
of
a
trial
court's
evidentiary
rulings,
aren't
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
a
trial
judge
has
to
sit
on
the
bench
and
make
numerous
rulings
on
the
admissibility
of
evidence--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--as
a
trial
proceeds.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
the
normal
case,
we
apply
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
to
reviewing
those
judgments
and
decisions,
which
have
to
be
made
very
quickly
and--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it's
a
tough
deal
for
the
trial
judge.
and
i
think,
in
general,
appellate
courts
have
recognized
that
difficulty
and
have
tended
not
to
upset
those
rulings
unless
it's...
it's
clearly
an
abuse
of
discretion.
but
you
want
some
more
searching
review
applied
to
the
exclusion
of
expert
testimony.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
sounds
like
you
want
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
for
our
review
of
court
of
appeals
decisions
reviewing
abuse
of
discretion
at
the
trial
level.
