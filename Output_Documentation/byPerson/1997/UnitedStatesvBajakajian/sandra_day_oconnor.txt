it
seems
a
little
odd,
though,
to
equate
excessiveness
with
just
instrumentality
as
opposed
to
some
examination
of
gross
proportionality,
or
lack
thereof.

i
mean,
the
mere
term
excessiveness
seems
to
import
some
notion
of
proportionality
to
me.
justice
sandra

o'connor
maybe
in
relation
to
the
criminal
fine
that
could
be
imposed,
or
something
like
that.
that
might
be
easy
to
look
at.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
guess
this
court
has
never
really
articulated
the
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
mr.
gornstein,
suppose
we
don't
share
your
enthusiasm
for
the
instrumentality
approach,
and
suppose
that
we're
more
interested
in
proportionality,
then
what
factors
should
guide
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
here...
let's
talk
about
it
in
terms
of
specifics.
here
the
maximum
fine
was
what,
250,000?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
total
amount
seized
was
300-some
thousand.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you'd
say
that
was
proportional.
