justice
david
h.
souter
ah,
but--
--this
is
not
an
in
rem
forfeiture
here,
is
it?
this
is
not
in
rem.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
gornstein,
do
the
old
cases
on
forfeiture
of
undutied
cargos
refer
to
the
forfeited
goods
as
being
instrumentalities,
or
have
we
simply
applied
that
term
as
a
term
of
art?
justice
david
h.
souter
the
latter,
okay.
when
did
that
develop?
i
mean,
it's
an
odd
usage,
and
i
just
like
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
--understand
why
we
use
those.
justice
david
h.
souter
quite
recent
law?
justice
david
h.
souter
your...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
going
back
to
justice
kennedy's
question,
we
could
simply
stop
using
the
word
instrumentality
here
and
consider
the
argument
that
the
analogy
is
so
close
between
the
undisclosed
currency
here
and
the
undutied
property
in
the
old
in
rem
cases,
that
that
would
the
basis
for
your--
justice
david
h.
souter
--without
getting
into
this
metaphysics.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
what's
the
historical
precedent
for
treating
undisclosed
money
in
the
same
way
that
you're--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
but
your
criterion
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg
was
historical
tradition,
and
there's
no
historical
tradition
drawing
the
analogy
that
you
want
us
to
draw.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
the
government's
interest
is
even
stronger,
because
the
government's
interest
is
not
only
an
interest
in
having
reports,
it's
an
interest
in
collecting
the
taxes.
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
if
instrumentality
is
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of
some
kind
of
sufficient
relationship
to
the
crime,
then
i
would
suppose
there
was
a
pretty
good
argument
for
treating
the
undisclosed
income
as
an
instrumentality.
you
can't
commit
the
crime
unless
you
have
the
income,
and
therefore
it's
hard
for
me
to
understand
why,
if
you're
going
to
treat
the
undisclosed
exported
money
as
an
instrumentality
without
the
benefit
of
a
historical
example,
and
you're
going
to
treat...
and
you're
going
to
define
instrumentality
as
this
close
relationship,
it's
hard
to
see
why
you
don't
fall,
it
seems
to
me,
into
exactly
the
position
that
justice
ginsburg
suggests,
that
if
we
take
your
position,
then
we
are,
in
fact,
opening
the
door
to
exactly
the
total
forfeiture
of
any
undisclosed
income
subject
to
tax.
why
will
that
not
be
the
conclusion?
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
it's
a
crime
of
omission
when
one
fails
to
declare
the
imported
goods
and
pay
the
duty.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
there
is
a...
i
don't
think
the
labels
matter,
but
there
is
a
sense
in
which
the
word
contraband
is
used
to
describe
the
undutied
goods.
why
isn't
that
analogy
just
as
good
when
the
person
taking
currency
out
fails
to
declare
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
why
should
that
be
the
point
of
distinction?
the
concern...
there
is
a
general
concern
with
undutied
goods,
and
that
is,
they
come
into
the
country
at
a
competitive
advantage.
the...
quite
apart
from
the
government's
loss
of
revenue,
they
tend
to
compete
with
products
within
the
country,
and
therefore
one
of
the
objects
of
a
duty
is
to
try
to
even
those
odds.
in
this
case,
the
government's
concern
with
exporting
unreported
funds
is,
if
one
is
allowed
to
do
that
it
tends
to
facilitate
tax
evasion,
skimming
of
illegal
profits,
and
so
on.
in
each
case,
there
is
a
social
ill
which
is
one
of
the
objects
of
declaring,
or
declaring
and
taxing
these
goods.
why
isn't
the
social
object
that
underlies
the
money-reporting
requirement
sufficient
to
support
the
analogy
between
that
and
the
undutied
goods?
why
should
the
fact
of
the
tax
be
crucial?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
this
is
a
means
or
not
a
means
in
the
same
sense
that
the
undutied
goods
are
means
or
not
means.
justice
david
h.
souter
whatever
you
call
it,
it's
in
the
same
relation
to
the
person
who
owns
the
goods.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
is
it
your
argument
simply
that
the
government
may
not
assume
and
this
court
may
not
assume
that
the
undutied
goods
are,
per
se,
forfeitable?
justice
david
h.
souter
they're
all
in
the
same
boat,
and
we've
got
to
go
through
the
same
proportionality
analysis
on
the
undutied
goods
that
we
would,
on
your
theory,
on
the
unreported
money.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right.
now,
what
about
the
government's
argument,
one
argument
in
response
to
that
that
if
it
is,
in
fact,
a
threat
of
certain
social
ills
to
allow
the
export
of
unreported
currency,
the
more
you
allow
to
be
exported,
the
greater
the
social
ill.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
there
is,
as
mr.
gornstein
said,
in
this
kind
of
case
as
opposed
to
the
taj
mahal
case
for
example,
there
really
is
a
kind
of
inherent
proportionality
involved
in
seizure
of
the
entire
amount,
whatever
that
amount
may
be.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
i'm
likely
to
be
skimming
profits,
the
more
money
i
take
out,
the
more
profit
i'm
likely
to
be
skimming.
justice
david
h.
souter
i'm
trying
to
understand
your
application
of
gross
disproportionality
here.
in
the
garden
variety
case
of
gross
disproportionality
i
think
one
of
the
things,
one
of
the
principal
things
that
we
do
is
to
compare
sentences
and
individuals.
it's
hard
to
do
that
here,
i
guess,
because
we
don't
have
a
long
string
of
forfeitures
to
compare
it
to.
are
you
really
saying,
when
you
use
the
gross
disproportionality
criterion,
and
you
then
point
out
the
factors
that
a
judge
should
consider
in
applying
it,
are
you
really
saying
that
any
judge
who
makes
a
gross
disproportionality
analysis
and
refers
to
all
of
the
relevant
factors
as
you
have
listed
them,
should
be
upheld
unless
we
can
say
that
his
determination
as
such
was
simply
unreasonable
or
irrational?
is
that
what
gross
disproportionality
here
means?
in
other
words,
it's
a
standard
that
goes
to
the
care
of
the
judge
or
relevant
considerations,
as
opposed
to
a
standard
that
goes
to
real
comparisons
between
this
instance,
that
instance,
and
the
other
instance.
