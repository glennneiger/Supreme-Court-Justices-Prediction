justice

bader

mr.
gornstein,
in
that
connection
i'm
a
little
confused.
what
is
the
difference
between
criminal
forfeiture
and
the
civil
in
rem,
because
i
had
been
i
guess
under
the
false
impression
that
for
civil
forfeiture
it
could
be
an
excessive
fine
to
take
the
whole
thing.
i
thought
that
was
what
austin
implied.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
explain
the
difference...
is
there
any
significant
difference
between
the
in
personam
criminal
and
the
in
rem
civil
for
this
purpose
of
judging
the
proportionality
or
the...
how
much
can
be
forfeited
without
being
too
much?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
no
difference.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
gorn--
--but
as
far
as
your
instrumentality,
it's
identical.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask,
then,
in
that
line,
that...
you've
been
candid
about
it,
that
it
doesn't
matter
that
it's...
that
the
money
is
possessed
legally,
the
crime
is
the
failure
to
report.
the
hypothetical
that
i
think
was
given
in
one
of
the
briefs
is,
suppose
congress
decided
to
say
that
failure
to
report
income,
that
the
consequence
of
that
will
not
be
just
the
ordinary
fines
that
they're...
that
are
now
in
place,
but
that
for
failure
to
report
you
forfeit
whatever
amount
you
fail
to
report.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
blatt--
--well--
--then
i
mistook
your
position.
i
thought
your
position
was,
if
the
money
is
clean,
then
any
forfeiture
was
excessive
and
you
don't
get
into
the
proportionality.
i
thought
that's
what
your
first
position
was.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
that
if
nothing
is
involved
other
than
failure
to
report--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
what
are
the
standards
that
you
would
say?
so
here's
this
47,
whatever
it
is.
you
have
already
disabused
me
of
one
notion,
that
because
they're
not
ill-gotten
gains
the
government
can't
take
any
of
it,
so
you
say
the
government
can
take
some
of
it,
so
how
much
is
too
much?
how
do
we
know?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
where
does
one...
you
said
we
look
at
this,
that,
and
the
other
thing.
where
does
one
go
to
find
those
guides?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
telling
me
essentially
that
you
think
that
judge
wallace,
then
was
it
chief
judge
wallace,
got
it
basically
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
he
used
the
right
factors,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--oh,
so
you...
the
district
judge.
then
judge
wallace--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
a
difference,
because
judge...
i
think
his
position
was
most
favorable
to
yours,
but
you
reject
that.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
didn't
he
say
that
the
15,000
he
was
letting
stand
because
you
hadn't
challenged
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
you
do
reject
the...
i'm
sorry
i
got
the
judges
mixed
up.
the
ninth
circuit
majority
said,
no
forfeiture
at
all
here
because
these
were
lawfully
possessed
funds,
so
you're
not
defending
that
position,
then.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
your
best
guide
to
the
development
is
what
the
district
court
did
here?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
what
guide
should
an
appellate
court...
this
is
one
district
judge
out
of,
what--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--did
the
chief
justice
say,
700?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
shocks
the
conscience.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
except
the
district
said,
and
the
government
i
think
concedes
they
must
show
that
the
defendant
knew
about
the
reporting
requirement
and
knew
that
it
was
illegal
to
take
out
more
than
x
amount
of
dollars.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i
thought
the
government...
maybe
i'm
wrong
about
this.
i
thought
the
government
conceded
that
it
must
prove
the
defendant
knew
it
was
unlawful
not
to
report
that
he
was
carrying
in
excess
of
10,000
dollar.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
there
was
no
such
thing
here,
because
the
agent
told
him.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
know--
