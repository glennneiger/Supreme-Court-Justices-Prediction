mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
respondent
was
about
to
board
a
flight
to
syria
when
a
customs
inspector
informed
him
that
he
was
required
to
file
a
currency
report
if
he
was
taking
more
than
10,000
dollars
with
him.
respondent
claimed
that
he
was
taking
less
than
10,000
dollars
and
he
therefore
did
not
file
a
currency
report.
customs
inspectors
searched
respondent
and
his
possessions
and
found
more
than
350,000
dollars
in
cash.
respondent
subsequently
pleaded
guilty
to
wilfully
failing
to
file
a
currency
report
as
he
was
about
to
transport
more
than
350,000
dollars
outside
this
country.
for
that
offense,
congress
has
mandated
forfeiture
of
the
unreported
currency.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
held,
however,
that
the
forfeiture
of
any
of
that
currency
would
constitute
an
excessive
fine.
we
believe
the
court
of
appeals
erred
for
two
reasons.
first,
the
unreported
currency
is
an
instrumentality
of
a
reporting
offense
and
may
be
forfeited
as
such
without
violating
the
excessive
fines
clause,
and
second,
even
if
it
is
not
an
instrumentality,
its
forfeiture
is
a
permissible
punishment
for
what
is
a
serious
criminal
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is
satisfied.
that
is
that
it
is
not...
it
is
a
way
of
showing
that
the
fine
is
nonexcessive
because
the
forfeiture
of
property
that
is
involved
in
the
offense
is
an
inherently
proportional...
proportionate
sanction.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
does,
but
the
manner
of
satisfying
the
excessive
fines
clause
is
by
showing
that
it
is
property
that's
seized...
one
way
of
satisfying
it,
it
is
showing
that
the
property
that
is
seized
is
in
fact
an
instrumentality
of
the
offense,
and
there...
questions
may
arise
about
whether
it
has
a
sufficiently
close
connection
to
the
offense
to
be
classified
properly
as
an
instrumentality,
but
once
it
is,
then
that
would
satisfy
the
excessive
fines
clause.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
historic--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
there
are
just
two
different
ways
of
talking
about
proportionality,
justice
kennedy.
proportionality,
it
is
inherently
proportionate
once
it's
an
instrumentality.
no
further
inquiry
into
culpability
or
to
the
value
of
the
property
is
ever
necessary
once
there
is
a
showing
that
this
is
in
fact
an
instrumentality
of
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
i'm
saying
that
it
is--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i'm
sorry
if
i...
if
we
had
a
misunderstanding
on
that,
but
generally
speaking,
if
the...
if
it
is
an
instrumentality,
then
it
is
per
se
nonexcessive,
and
i
would
except
from
that
one
small
category
of
cases
where
perhaps
the
property
is
involved
in
what
might
be
a
minor
infraction
such
as
a
parking
violation,
but
if
it
is
the
kind
of
violations
that
property
have
historically
been
forfeited
for
customs
violations,
for
criminal
offenses,
then
if
it
is
an
instrumentality
in
the
offense,
then
it
is
per
se
a
proportionate
fine
and
not
an
excessive
one.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
i
think
the
question
is
excessive
in
relation
to
what.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
that's
right,
and
here
i
think
that
when
some--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but
i
think
that
historically
it
was
that
if
as
long
as
it
was
in
relationship
to
the
offense,
that
the
property
was
used
in
the
offense,
the
seizure
was
not
an
excessive
fine,
because
it
has
always
been
the
case
that
this
has
been
viewed
as
a
reasonable
way,
seizure
of
property
involved
in
the
offense,
a
reasonable
and
effective
way
to
encourage
the
owners
of
property
to
make
sure
that
their
property
does
not
become
involved
in
the
offense.
it
is
not
excessive
in
that
sense.
it
is
perfectly
commensurate
with
that
goal,
because
it
has
always--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
has
not,
and
the
two
cases
that
this
court
has
had
previously
on
the
excessive
fines
clause
simply
said
that
forfeiture
was
a
fine,
but
in
neither
case
did
the
court
set
out
the
methodology
for
deciding
whether
the
fine
would
be
excessive.
now,
our
view
is
that
there
are
really
two
ways
to
do
it.
first,
if
it's
an
instrumentality
then
it's
not
excessive,
without
more.
but
second,
if
it
isn't
an
instrumentality,
then
you
would
engage
in
the
sort
of
inquiry
that
you
would
generally
engage
in
if
you
had
a
monetary
fine.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
the
instrumentality
is
really
just
a
shorthand
expression
for
the
kind
of
property
that
has
historically
been
subject
to
forfeiture
in
rem
because
of
the
significant
involvement
of
the
property
in
the
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it's
not
an
in
rem
forfeiture,
but
the
criminal
provision
here
in
addressing
the
kind
of
property
that
is
subject
to
forfeiture
singled
out
only
property
that
is
involved
in
the
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
that
is
the
shorthand
expression
for
the
kind
of
property
that
has
historically
been
subject
to
in
rem
forfeiture,
and
we
think
by
using
that
language
congress
manifested
its
intent
to
further
the
general
remedial
goals
that
have
always
been
associated
with
in
rem
forfeitures.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
that
the
only
thing
that
austin
held
was
that
it
was
a
fine,
and
then
it
did
not
decide
how
you
would
decide
whether
a
fine
was
or
was
not
excessive.
now,
the
property
that
was
seized
in
austin
itself
may
have
been
so
incidentally
involved
in
the
offense
that
it
couldn't
properly
be
characterized
as
an
instrumentality
of
the
offense,
and
if
not,
it
could
not
be
forfeited
on
an
instrumentality
theory.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
for
purposes
of
our
first
argument,
that
is,
whether
it
is
an
instrumentality,
there
is
no
difference.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but
for
the
purpose
of
our
second
argument,
if
you
disagree
with
us
on
the
first
one,
there
is
a
difference,
because
the
criminal
forfeiture
embodies
the
additional
purpose
of
punishing
the
criminal
defendant,
whereas,
to
the
extent
that
punishment
is
involved
in
civil
in
rem,
it
is
punishment
only
of
the
owner.
now,
here
the
criminal
defendant
can
be
both
the
criminal
defendant
and
the
owner,
and
he
can
be
punished
in
both
ways
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
but
in
a
civil
in
rem
proceeding
the
only
person
that
is
being
punished,
if
anyone
is
being
punished,
is
the
owner
of
the
property.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
would
be
the
same
exact
analysis.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
latter.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yeah.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
i
wish
i
had
a
full
explanation
for
this,
but
i
would
say
one
of
the
sources
of
it
was
justice
scalia's
concurring
opinion
in
austin,
and
i
think
a
lot
of
the
courts
which
use
the
phrase
instrumentality
to
describe--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--quite
recent,
yeah,
that
used
the
phrase
instrumentality
to
describe
the
kind
of
property
that
has
a
sufficiently
close
connection
to
the
offense
and
that
could
historically
be
subject
to
forfeiture.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
a
lot
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
have
struggled
with
this
question
since
then
have
picked
up
on
that
phrase,
and
it's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you
absolutely
could.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
you
do
not
have
to
get
into
an
elaborate
discussion
of
what
is
and
is
not
an
instrumentality
in
this
case.
you
can
decide
this
case
based
on
its
relationship
to
the
early
customs
cases,
and
in
the
early
customs
cases,
property
was
brought
into
the
country
without
declaration
it
was
subject
to
forfeiture.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
think
not,
because
again
that's
a...
that
historically
has
not
been
a
way
in
which
forfeiture
law
has
been
used.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i
think
in
your
example
that...
the
question
would
be
whether
that
was
an
instrumentality
of
the
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
no,
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
that's
the
inquiry,
and
what
i
would
say
is
in
that
case
the
relationship
of
the
property
to
the
offense
is
so
minor
and
incidental
that
it
was
never--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--and
i
think
that
the...
you
start
with
the
history
of
the
early
customs
statutes.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i...
with
the
provisos
that
i
said,
that
there
are
two
inquiries
that
have
to
be
made.
the
first
is
that
it
is
sufficiently
involved
in
the
offense
to
be
treated
as
an
instrumentality,
and
if
you're
running
a
business
out
of
the
taj
mahal,
yes,
that
certainly
could
be
forfeited.
if
there's
one
transaction
that
takes
place
there,
even
on
a
single
day,
maybe
or
maybe
not,
but
at
some
point
yes,
if
you're
running
a
business
out
of
the
taj
mahal
and
selling
drugs
out
of
there,
that
would
be
an
instrumentality
and
could
be
forfeited
as
such.
now,
the
reason
that...
there
are
two
powerful
reasons,
it
seems
to
us,
why
instrumentality
forfeitures
satisfy
the
excessive
fines
clause,
and
the
first
is
history.
if
you
look
at
the
early
forfeiture
laws,
they
require
forfeiture
of
goods
brought
into
this
country
without
declaration
regardless
of
how
valuable
those
goods
were.
it
could
have
been
priceless
jewelry
or
ordinary
gems.
if
those
goods
were
brought
into
the
country
without
declaration,
they
were
subject
to
forfeiture
as
such.
this
is
the
very
same
first
congress
that
proposed
the
excessive
fines
clause,
so
i
think
we
have
to
start
with
the
understanding
that
that
congress
did
not
view
that
kind
of
forfeiture
as
excessive.
we
know
from
austin
that
the
congress
viewed
it
as
a
fine,
so
the
only
thing
that
we
can
understand
from
that
congress'
action
is
that
they
must
have
thought
that
that
kind
of
forfeiture
was
not
excessive
because
of
the
relationship
of
the
property
in
the
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
fair
characterization,
because
contraband
as
we
understand
it
is
something
that
is
unlawful
to
possess.
the
goods
that
were
being
brought
into
the
country
to
sell
were
perfectly
legal
to
sell
as
long
as
the
appropriate
duties
were
paid
on
them,
and
the
fact
that
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--here
it's
perfectly
legal
to
take
money
out
of
the
country
and
transport
it
out
of
the
country,
but
only
as
long
as
you
make
the
report,
and
so
it
has
the
exact
same
relationship
to
the
offense
as
the
traditional...
the
goods
in
a
customs
offense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
stevens,
i
would
be
happy--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
would
be
happy
to
decide
this
case--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--if
you
want
to
use
the
word
contraband
to
describe
this
kind
of
property,
that
is
fine
with
us.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
the
reason
that
we
did
not
argue
it
in
those
terms
is
that
we
understood
the
term
contraband
to
mean
property
that
is
unlawful
to
possess,
like--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--like
drugs,
that's
right,
that
are...
that
sort
of
uniformly,
with
rare
exceptions,
unlawful
to
possess,
not
property
that
is
legitimate
to
possess,
but
is
used
in
the
commission
of
the
offense.
now,
i
say...
having
said
that,
this
is
a
peculiar
kind
of
property
instrumentality
that
looks
like
contraband
and
could
be
called
the
corpus
of
the
offense,
and
if
you
want
to
decide
the
case
on
that
basis
by
saying
you
can
always
forfeit
the
corpus
of
the
offense
because
that--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--that's
correct.
as
long
as
they
were
used
in
the
commission
of
this
offense,
they
are
subject
to
forfeiture,
and
it
is
not
excessive,
in
the
same
way
that
property
imported
into
this
country
that
is
lawfully
possessed
and
intended
for
a
lawful
purpose,
to
sell
it,
is
also
subject
to
forfeiture.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
we
view
that
question
as
not
being
one
of...
we
view
the
earned
income
as
not
being
an
instrumentality
of
that
offense.
there
has
been
no
historical
tradition
of
treating
earned
income
as
an
instrumentality
of
a
failure
to
file
an
income
tax
return,
and
the
relationship
is
different.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
it
is
the
very
property
that
moves
across
the
border
without
proper
declaration.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
well,
i...
in
addition
to
there
being
no
historical
tradition,
though,
the
relationship
to
the
offense
in
that
case
is
different,
because
earning
income
is
a
condition
of
having
a
duty
to
report,
but
the
money
is
not
physically
used
in
the
commission
of
the
offense
as
it
is
here.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
and
that's
right,
and
that's
why
it
may
or
may
not
be
an
excessive
fine
based
on
the
value
of
the
fine
as
against
the
gravity
of
the
offense.
you
would
turn
to
that
analysis.
we're
not
saying
that
if
there's...
a
property
is
not
an
instrumentality
it
can't
be
forfeited.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
souter,
the
historical
analogy
is
much
more
complete
in
the
case
of
currency,
and
the
reason
is
that
what
the
currency
is
doing,
it
is
being
physically
transported
across
the
border
without
declaration.
it
is
actually
physically...
the
money
is
there,
and
it
is
being
moved,
and
that
is
part
of
the
offense
of
transporting
money
outside
this
country
without
proper
declaration
just
like
the
traditional
customs
law.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
is,
but
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the
offense
is
still...
part
of
the
offense
is
physically
transporting
the
money
across
the--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--actually,
on
the
receiving
end
that
would
be
true.
on
the
export
end--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--you
have
to
file
the
report--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
analogy
is
still
complete,
because
the
money
itself
is...
part
of
the
offense
is
physically
moving
the
money
across
the
border,
and
the
money
is
immediately
and
directly
involved
in
the
offense
in
the
way
that
earned
income
is
not,
which
it's
just
earned
over
a
period
of
time,
and
then
in
a
calendar
year
you
report
on
your
income
and
tax--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
don't
think
that
that
makes
a
difference.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
i
don't
think
that
that
makes
a
difference,
and
part...
and
one
of...
to
go
back
to
a
question
about,
that
this
does
not
apply
even
when
it
is
legitimate,
found
to
be
legitimate
and
intended
for
a
lawful
purpose,
the
reason
that
congress
imposed
very
serious
penalties
despite
that
is
that
there
are
many,
many
cases
in
which
it
is
impossible
for
the
government
to
know
at
the
moment
of
seizure
whether
or
not
property
is
intended
for
particular
unlawful
purposes
like
tax
evasion,
for
like,
money
laundering,
like
large-scale
drug-dealing.
and
if
it
were
the
case
that
persons
bent
on
those
purposes
knew
that
unless
the
government
knew
at
the
moment
of
seizure
that
they
were
planning
to
export
that
money
for
those
purposes,
they
would...
that
the
money
would
be
free
and
clear,
they
would
have
far
less
incentive
to
comply
with
the
reporting
requirements
in
the
first
place,
and
that
would
resurrect
the
very
state
of
affairs
that
congress
faced
when
it
enacted
this
law
where--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--the...
this
court
has
set
out
in
two
areas
the
kind
of
approach
that
it
uses
when...
to
measure
excessiveness
in
both
the
area
of
punitive
damages
and
the
area
of
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
and
the
guiding
factors,
it
seems
to
us,
can
be
drawn
from
those
opinions,
but
first
of
all
you
would
have
to
say
that
the
offense
has
to
be,
in
terms
of
value...
i'm
sorry,
the
penalty
in
terms
of
value
has
to
be
grossly
disproportionate
to
the
gravity
of
the
offense.
second,
you
would
always
have
to
give
deference--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
was.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
350-plus.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
certainly
is
proportional,
but
i
think
that,
justice
o'connor,
it's
certainly
one
barometer
of
proportionality
to
look
to
the
fine
that's
imposed,
but
it's
not
the
only
one,
or
even
the
most
important
one.
we
would
suggest
that
in
measuring
the
seriousness
of
an
offense
you
look
first
to
the
measure
that
this
court
has
always
used
as
the
best
indicator
of
how
seriously
congress
regards
an
offense,
and
that's
the
maximum
period
of
incarceration,
which
here
is
5
years'
imprisonment
without
any
aggravating
factors
at
all,
and
it's
10
years'
imprisonment
if
the
money
is
involved
in
other
offenses,
and
from
that
you
know
that
congress
regarded
this
as
a
very
serious
offense,
and
when
you--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--it
does.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
in
that
case,
in
that
sense
this
law
has
a
feature
of
almost
perfect
proportionality
in
that
sense.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
could
not
be
forfeited
in
a
criminal
proceeding,
but
it
could
be
forfeited
in
a
civil
in
rem
proceeding.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
it
could
not
be
forfeited...
you
can
only
forfeit
the
defendant's
property
in
a
criminal
proceeding.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
justice
scalia,
i
don't
see
what
in
the
constitution
would
require
congress
to
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
it
makes
no
sense
constitutionally
to
say,
if
we
had
convicted
this
defendant
and
then
filed
an
in
rem
proceeding
it
would
be
per
se
nonexcessive
to
take
the
property,
but
if
we
add
it
as
a
feature
of
a
sentence
in
which
the
defendants
is
the
property
owner
and
we've
taken
it
from
him,
that
it's
somehow
possibly
an
excessive
fine,
that
congress
can
try
to
accomplish
more
than
one
aim
at
a
time,
it
can
try
to
punish
a
criminal
defendant
and
at
the
same
time
serve
the
long...
the
general
goals
of
in
rem
forfeiture
in
that
proceeding.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
those
two
facts
are
not
relevant,
because
what
you
are--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--justice
stevens,
there
is
always
the
possibility
that
you
would
disagree
with
us
that
the
offense
itself
was
what
you
looked
at,
which
is
what
we
think
is
the
proper
analysis,
and
that's--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i'm...
and
so
it
would...
we
went
on,
then,
to
address
the
particulars
of
this
case
on
the
theory
that
we've
lost
our
first
argument
that
you
don't
look
at
those
things.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
but--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--well,
there's
two
points
to
that.
the
first
is
that
the
money
is
still
dangerous.
there
is
a
dangerous--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--i
think
that
what--
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
--no.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
at
the
moment
of
seizure
congress
has
said
we
realize
that
you're
not
going
to
know
for
sure
where
this
money
is
headed
for.
we're
going
to
treat
it
all
as
if
it's
dangerous.
and
then
the
only
place
where
congress
said,
okay,
if
it's
shown
to
involve
in
other
offenses
we're
going
to
take
account
of
that,
is
by
increasing
the
maximum
authorized
sentence
from
5
years
to
10
years,
so
up
to
5
years'
imprisonment,
a
mandatory
forfeiture,
250,000
dollar
fine.
congress
said,
all
of
this
money
that
is
unreported
and
is
more
than
10,000
dollars,
this
is
dangerous
money.
we
have
a
dangerous
situation
on
our
hand,
and
we
cannot
be
sure
that
at
the
moment
of
seizure
anybody
is
going
to
know
about
that,
and
in
order
to
get
the
right
level
of
deterrence,
we
are
going
to
have
mandatory
forfeiture.
everybody
is
going
to
have
to
report,
and
if
you
do
not...
regardless
of
what
your
purposes
are,
and
if...
if
you
do
not
report,
the
money
is
going
to
be
forfeited.
mr.
irving
l.
gornstein
yes.
justice
scalia,
our
position
is
that
you
do
just
look
at
it
by
the
statute,
and
that's
the...
harmeline
basically
stands
for
that
proposition,
that
congress
does
not
have
to
individualize
sentences
in
that
way.
