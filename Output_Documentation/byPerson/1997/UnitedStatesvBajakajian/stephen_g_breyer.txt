justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
isn't
quite...
i
mean,
the
underlying
issue,
i
think,
which
is
possibly
a
point
of
agreement
or
disagreement
with
judge
wallace,
is
that
your
view
is,
if
something
is
an
instrumentality,
no
matter
how
valuable,
it
is
forfeitable
if
it's
involved
in
a
crime,
no
matter
how
trivial,
with
the
exception
of
parking
offenses.
all
right.
so
that
means
that
the
constitution
would
permit,
in
your
view,
the
taj
mahal,
for
example,
to
be
forfeited
if
it
was
once
used
to
sell
a
teaspoonful
of
marijuana
or
something
like
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah.
well,
now
wait,
then.
that's
interesting,
because
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
drive
at.
i
thought
your
initial
view
was
what
i
said,
and
now
you
have
a
limitation
on
that
initial
view,
and
you
say
it
only
applies
where?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
oh,
no,
no,
i'm
assuming
it
was.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
let
me
make
an
example
with
the
hypothetical
where
it
is
not
minor
and
incidental.
people
are
called
to
the
taj
mahal
deliberately
in
order
to
sell
them
the
teaspoon
of
marijuana.
you
know,
it's
easy
to
do
that,
and
i'm
trying
to
get
at
the
underlying
point.
is
the
underlying
point
correct,
without
limitation,
no
matter
how
valuable
the
property,
it
is
forfeitable
if
used
to
commit
a
crime,
no
matter
how
trivial,
and
my
difficulty,
of
course,
if
it's
without
limitation,
is
how
one
would
reconcile
that
with
the
excessive...
what
seems
to
be
a
prohibition
of
excessive
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
i
have
it
right,
what
your
position
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
go
back
to
proportionality
for
a
second--
--well,
can
i
just
finish?
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
the
criminal
one
here,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
but...
sorry.
finish,
please.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
on
proportionality,
just
to
follow
up
on
this
very
question,
the
kinds
of
things
that
i
used
to
look
at
on
the
sentencing
commission
and
so
forth,
first
you
would
look
at
the
conduct,
and
for
the
worst
conduct
you'd
get
a
higher
sentence,
and
the
second
thing
that
you'd
look
at
would
be
the
harm
done,
and
the
more
the
harm
done,
the
higher
the
sentence.
so
10,000
dollars
to
350,000
is
proportionate
if,
and
only
if,
the
350,000
dollars
means
more
harm
than
the
10,000,
and
the
argument
that
it
doesn't
is,
it
doesn't
here
because
what
congress
is
trying
to
stop
is
money
laundering,
drugs,
a
whole
host
of
unlawful
things,
and
here
the
judge
agrees
it's
nothing
to
do
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there
was
no...
what
his
argument
is
that
there's
no
harm
in
this
case
that's
proportionate,
and
the
culpability,
of
course,
is
the
same
whether
you're
taking
the
10
or
the
350.
now,
that,
i
think,
is
the
argument
this
is
disproportionate,
so
i'd
like
you
to
address
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
of
course
it
is,
but
it's
not...
is
it
30,
350
or
35
times
as
dangerous?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why,
if
it's
just
going
to
somebody
in
armenia
who
happened
to
lend
him
some
money?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
you
go
back
for
a
second,
because
i'm
now
concerned...
mr.
gornstein
answered
me
and
justice
scalia
picked
up
a
point
that
i'd
not
focused
on,
which
is
that
this
is
a
mandatory
forfeiture
statute.
it
says
the
defendant
shall
forfeit.
now,
i
can
understand
a
statute
that
says
the
convicted
person
in
a
case
of
robbery
must
pay
a
penalty
up
to
5
million
dollars
as
well
as
prison,
and
then
a
person
take
1
dollar,
and
the
judge
imposes
5
million
dollars,
and
you
say,
well,
that's
way
disproportionate,
but
the
statute
said
may,
and
i
think
his
point
is
here
that
the
statute
says
shall,
and
so
what
congress
is
saying
here
is,
you
shall.
you
have
to.
the
judge
has
no
discretion,
and
where
the
judge
has
no
discretion
you
would
look
to
see
whether
congress
is
being
reasonable
in
writing
that
statute,
shall,
and
not
looking
to
those
factors.
now,
is
there...
does
that
trigger
anything
in
your
mind,
any
instance
where
despite
this
kind
of
mandatory
statutory
provision
the
courts
nonetheless
looked
into
the
way
in
which
the
provision
applied
to
a
particular
case
and
said,
it's
unconstitutional
because
of
the
way
it
applies
here?
does
that
trigger
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
but
was
that
a
case
in
which
the
fine
that
was
imposed,
or
the
for--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
don't
know
if
it
was
a
fine...
was
mandatory
under
the
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it
was.
they
had
to
impose,
so--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
isn't.
i
mean,--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
is
a
principle
in
punishment
law
i've
never
seen
anywhere,
that
it
is
proportionately
worse.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
every
bit
of
punishment
law
i've
ever
seen
suggests
that
it
does
increase
in
culpability,
but
not
proportionately.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's...
at
least,
maybe
your
experience
is
different
on
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
it's
worse.
there's
no
question.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
worse,
but
i
have
not
seen
proportionality
in
respect
to
punishment
proportional
to
the
amount
of
dollars.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there's
a
lot
to
the
contrary.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
if
that's
so,
suppose
i
accept
your
argument
that
say
in
an
environmental
case
they're
not
going
to
forfeit
the
factory
because
some,
you
know,
stuff
spilled
out
the
pipe
intentionally,
because
i
got
that
far,
assume.
now,
suppose
we're
also,
because
of
this
alexander
that
you
cited...
it's
alexander,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
quite
right,
it
said
shall
forfeit.
now,
suppose
because
of
that
we
have
to
look
at
the
application
case-by-case.
still
i'm
back
to
where
justice
o'connor
started.
it's
very
hard
to
believe
that
all
we're
going
to
do
is
in
every
single
case
start
looking
as
to
whether
there's
an
abuse
of
discretion.
is
there
not
some
standard
that
you've
come
across
that
could
catch
the
extreme
cases
that
wouldn't
involve
an
analysis
case
by
case,
instant
by
instance,
of
whether
the
judge
somehow
went
a
little
wrong,
or,
in
your
view,
do
you
have
to
conduct
that
under
the
constitution?
how
do
you,
in
other
words,
give
what
we
call
a
margin
of
appreciation
to
the
judge
to
make
some
kind
of
mistake
before
the
constitution
comes
into
play?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about,
in
terms
of
a
constitutional
limit,
a
word
like
shocking?
