we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1487,
united
states
v.
hosep
krikor
bajakajian.
mr.
gornstein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
drugs,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
don't
think
we
need
another
phrase.
[laughter]
but
mr.
gornstein,
maybe
we
need
two,
because
i
take
it
on
your
theory
nothing
rides
on
whether
these
are
ill-gotten
gains,
that
is,
not
possessed
lawfully,
and
are
going
to
be
devoted
to
an
unlawful
purpose,
money
laundering,
and
whether,
as
at
least
we
must
take
this
case,
the
possessor
had
a
lawful
right
to
possess
and
was
going
to
use
the
money
toward
lawful
ends.
so
do
i
understand
your
position
right
that,
for
purposes
of
the
amount
of
the
forfeiture
and
the
excessive
fines,
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
the
funds
were
possessed
totally
lawfully
or
they
were,
indeed,
ill-gotten
gains?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gornstein.
mr.
blatt,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
explain...
i
don't
really
understand
the
finding
that
the
crime
was
committed
because
of
cultural
differences.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
if
one
lies
out
of
fear,
it's
not
the
same
thing
as
lying
for
some
other
motive.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if,
under
justice
scalia's
hypothesis,
the
defendant
in
the
firearm
case
took
the
stand
and
said,
well,
in
my
country
it's
perfectly
legal
to
have
a
firearm,
so
i
did
it
kind
of
for
cultural
reasons.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
we
could
have...
you
know,
we
have
700
district
judges
in
the
country,
and
we
could
have
700
different
results,
all
of
them
correct
under
that
standard,
i
suppose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
that's
desirable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
you've
got
not
only
a
prohibition
against
excessive
fines,
but
a
prohibition
against
cruel
and
unusual
punishment.
could
this
be
imported
into
the
sentencing
phase
of
criminal
cases
and
say,
you
know,
whatever
congress
says
each
district
judge
has
just
got
to
figure
out
what
the
right
punishment
is
to
make
sure
it
isn't
cruel
and
unusual?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
blatt.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
