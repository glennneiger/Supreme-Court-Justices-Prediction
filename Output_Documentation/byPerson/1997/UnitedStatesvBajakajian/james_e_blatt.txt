mr.
james
e.
blatt
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case,
a
criminal
in
personam
matter,
is
here
because
a
district
court
determined
that
forfeiture
of
357,144
dollars
would
be
grossly
disproportionate
under
the
eighth
amendment
for
a
failure-to-declare
offense.
the
decision
was
based
on
the
following
factual
findings
by
the
district
court:
that
the
money
involved
was
lawful
money
for
a
lawful
purpose;
that
the
crime
was
committed
in
reference
to
cultural
differences,
and
that
the
lies
that
mr.
bajakajian
stated
grew
out
of
fear.
mr.
bajakajian
was
sentenced
with
these
fact--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--what
happened
in
this
matter,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
my
client,
mr.
bajakajian,
is
from
syria.
he
was
a
minority
there,
an
armenian,
and
where
he
grew
up
he
was
very
frightened
and
afraid
of
the
government
in
reference
to
moneys
taken
in
and
out.
when
he
left
this
country
to
pay
a
lawful
debt,
and
he
was
going
to
cyprus,
not
to
syria,
he
thought
that
he
would
be
harmed,
or
the
money
might
be
taken
from
him
if
he
showed
how
much
money
he
had.
we
indicated
that
to
the
district
court.
the
district
court
took
that
into
consideration,
and
took
also
into
consideration
the
lies
that
he
made,
which
were
primarily
out
of
fear,
when
it
came
up
with
a
grossly
disproportionate
analysis.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
yes,
your
honor.
it's
a
factor
that
has
to
be
considered
in
reference
to
whether
the
money
was
lawful,
and
for
a
lawful
purpose,
because
it
relates
to
the
culpability.
if
one
lies
not...
if
one
lies
because
he
or
she
is
not
involved
in
a
criminal
enterprise,
but
because
they
are
frightened,
and
we're
not
trying
to
excuse
the
culpability
of
mr.
bajakajian,
but
it's
a
factor
for
a
court
to
consider
in
reference
to
punishment.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
justice
scalia,
i
believe
that.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
think
they
can
handle
that
burden,
justice
scalia,
because
when
we're
talking
about
the
eighth
amendment
and
punishment
it's
the
district
court's
responsibility
to
weigh
culpability
and
value.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
that's
always
a
possibility,
yes.
district
courts
can
come
up
with
different
determinations.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
yes.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
well,
when
we're...
your
honor,
when
we're
talking
about--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--in
reference
to
statutory
and
constitutionally,
no,
your
honor,
but
in
reference
to
when
we're
evaluating
this
on
a
proportionality
analysis,
under
austin
and
alexander
this
court
made
a
determination
that
the
eighth
amendment
applies
in
reference
to
forfeitures.
by
the
nature
of
the
word
excessive,
it
implies
a
proportionality
or
a
comparison
analysis,
your
honor,
and
in
order
to
do
that
type
of
comparison,
a
judge,
a
district
court
judge
would
have
to
make
a
determination
about
culpability.
this
was
lawful
money
for
a
lawful
purpose.
there
was
no
criminal
enterprise
involved
here.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
believe
that,
your
honor,
that
would
be
entirely
constitutional
for
the
following
reason.
that
firearm
is
contraband.
it's
an
illegal
weapon.
it's
used
in
the
furtherance
of
a
crime.
this
money
was
not
contraband.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
acknowledge
that,
your
honor,
that
contraband
and
proceeds
of
contraband
are
forfeitable,
but
this
is
an
instrument,
allegedly
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime,
a
means
by
which
a
crime
is
committed.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
under
the
statute
it
is,
your
honor,
because
the
statute
indicates
that
it's
not
contraband
to
have
the
money
and
to
transport
the
money
outside
of
the
country.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
correct.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
correct,
your
honor.
if
this
money
was
from...
laundered
money,
it
was
involved
in
some
type
of
criminal
enterprise.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
or
if
it
was
money
that
was
going
out
of
the
country
not
to
pay
taxes,
to
avoid
payment
of
taxes,
then
it
would
be
tainted
money,
an
instrumentality,
but--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--well,
it
depends
on
whether
it
was
lawful
or
not.
i
think
that's
one
factor
that
has
to
be
considered,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
you
have
to
look
at
the
total
context
or
totality
of
the
circumstances.
this
was
an
unusual
case.
it
is
never
easy
at
the
district
level
to
prove
that
in
reference
to
a
forfeiture
that
it's
lawful
money
for
a
lawful
purpose,
and
the
way
we
did
that,
we
showed
the
cultural
aspects,
the
man's
intent,
and
the
district
court
made
a
factual
determination
in
reference
to
this,
that
this
was
lawful
money,
and
he
made
a
factual
determination
as
to
reasons
that
he
lied.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
no,
your
honor.
he
made
a
determination--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--well,
the
ambiguity
lay
with
the
government's
position
that
they
couldn't
really
prove
or
disprove
certain
facts,
but
the
district
judge
indicated
that
this
was
lawful
money
for
a
lawful
person...
for
a
lawful
purpose,
and
that
much
has
been
proven.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
the
taxes
had
been
paid
on
it,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
yes,
it
does,
justice
breyer.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
because
under
austin
and
alexander
this
court
indicated
that
the
eighth
amendment
in
reference
to
excessive
fine
does
apply.
on
the
remand
of
alexander--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--when
that
case
was
decided
there
was
a
breakdown
by
alexander
using
the
busher
ninth
circuit
standards
of
what
proportionality
should
be,
and
they
looked
at
the
value
of
the
crime--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--forfeiture.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
yes,
it
was.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
one
of
the
problems
in
the
government's
position
is
that
they
indicate
that
the
eighth
amendment
does
apply.
however,
they
go
on
to
state
that
the
particular
liquidated
damage
forfeiture
can
never
be
grossly
disproportionate.
it
doesn't
matter
whether
it's
10,001
dollars,
or
3
million
dollars.
it's
always
going
to
be
the
same,
no
matter
in
reference
to
culpability
and
value.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
in
one
lot
emerald,
your
honor--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--you
forfeit
the
moonstone...
assuming
you
buy
the
moonstone
legally,
your
honor,
and
you
fail
to
report
it
and
then
fail
to
pay
the
duty,
pursuant
to
the
statute,
once
you
fail
to
pay
the
duty
it
becomes
contraband,
and
that
property
becomes
tainted.
we
don't
have
that
situation
here.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
if
it's
contraband,
or
proceeds
from
contraband,
or
if
it
fits
into
the
historical
standard
as--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--i
would
agree
with
you,
your
honor,
in
that,
because
the
legal
fiction--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--i
like
that
moonstone,
but...
i
see
what
you're
saying,
your
honor.
i
think
the
problem
is,
is
how
we
evaluate
an
instrumentality.
an
instrumentality
is
a
means
by
which.
we
have
property
divided
in
three
areas,
contraband,
proceeds
of
contraband,
and
an
instrumentality,
and
contraband
and
proceeds
of
contraband
have
always
been
a
strong
remedial
interest,
and
have
been
forfeited.
instrumentality,
there
has
to
be
a
connection.
in
this
particular
case,
and
i
would
agree
from
a
common,
practical
point
of
view,
we're
splitting
hairs.
when
we're
talking
about
an
instrumentality,
should
it
really
relate
to
a
substantial
connection?
i
believe
there
should
be
some
type
of
cutoff
point
in
reference
to
instrumentality,
but
the
historical
legal
fiction
doesn't
really
fit
any
more.
in
other
words,
it's...
we
now
look
under
modern
times
that
the...
in
reference
to
the
property,
as
to
the
use
of
the
property,
and
not
truly
in
relation
to
its
respect
as
to
how
it
was
used
during
piracy
times.
i
think
the
key
issue
in
this
matter
is
whether
the
district
court
used
the
appropriate
standard
of
grossly
disproportionate
when
it
forfeited
approximately
15,000
dollars.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
no,
i--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--no.
my...
excuse
me,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first...
in
reference
to
the
instrumentality
argument,
i
was
arguing
that
it
really
wasn't
an
instrumentality.
it
is
a
crime
of
omission.
it
was
not
contraband.
it
doesn't
fit
under
the
traditional
historical
standard
of
what
an
instrumentality
is.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
yes.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
justice
souter,
the
reason
it's
not
as
good
is
that...
is
because
in
one
lot
emerald
you
had
to
pay
a
duty.
once
you
did
not
pay
that
duty,
by
statute
it
became
contraband.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
think
the
court
is
correct,
that
if...
that
in
reference
to
splitting
hairs
in
this
matter,
if
we're
going
to
evaluate
it,
there
is
a
strong
remedial
interest,
and
we've
never
denied
this
in
our
brief,
that
the
government
should
have
the
opportunity
to
determine
what
funds
are
leaving
this
country,
and
that's
equally
as
strong
remedial
interest
in
reference
to
smuggled
goods.
the
problem
here
is
one
of
semantics.
in
reference
to
an
instrumentality,
it's
not
a
means
by
which
a
crime
or
contraband
was
conveyed.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
whatever
you
call
it
there's
a
substantial
connection,
but
where
we
disagree
with
the
government
is
that
when
they
see
the
substantial
connection,
but-for,
and/or
an
instrumentality,
that's
where
their
position
ends.
if
it's
an
instrumentality,
it
all
must
be
forfeited,
and
there's
no
really
proportionality
analysis.
if
it's
an
instrumentality,
we
take
it
all,
irregardless
of
culpability,
irregardless
of
whether
the
money--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--that
is
correct.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
in
other
words,
we
have
the
first
issue
as
to
the
connection,
and
once...
because
this
is
a
forfeiture,
because
the
eighth
amendment
does
apply
in
reference
to
punishment,
there
has
to
be
a
second
analysis
as
to
whether
it
is
grossly
disproportionate
or
not.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
that
is--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
i
don't
see
an
inherent
proportionality.
this
was
money
that
had
been
earned--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
goes
to
culpability.
this
money
wasn't
received
for
money
laundering
or
anything
illegal,
and
it
was
not
for
an
illegal
purpose.
the
examples--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--it
depends
on
the
reasoning.
if
we're
talking
about
punishment,
your
honor,
we're
talking
about--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
it
is
a
factor
to
consider.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
well--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--well--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--well,
justice
breyer,
what
i'm
indicating
is
that
it
has
an
effect
on
the
culpability.
obviously,
if
someone
is
taking
out
millions
of
dollars
for
an
unlawful
purpose--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--it's
much
worse.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
what
i
meant,
your--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--what
i
meant,
your
honor,
was
in
reference
to
culpability.
if
the
eighth
amendment
is
going
to
apply,
which
this
court
has
indicated
that
it
should
concerning
excessive
fines,
then--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor.
i
don't
know
the
answer.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
well,
we
used
a
standard,
your
honor,
of
grossly
disproportionate.
we
look
at
the
value,
we
look
at
the
culpability,
we
look
at
the
harm
that
could
be
caused
in
reference
to
this
to
the
government.
once
the
information
was
found
there
was
no
harm
to
the
government.
they
now
have
the
information.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
we
look
at
the
alexander
remand.
we
look
at
busher.
in
those...
and
in
that
particular
case
they
evaluated
the
harshness
of
the
penalty
in
light
of
the
gravity
of
the
offense.
they
evaluated
the
defendant's
culpability.
they
looked
at
the
dollar
volume
of
the
loss,
the
existence
of
any
benefit
to
the
defendant,
which
there
was
none
in
this
particular
case,
and
the--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
think
that
judge
davies,
the
district
court
used
the
exact
factors
that
were
necessary
in
this
matter.
he
looked
at
this
matter
as
to
whether
it
was
grossly
disproportionate.
he
looked
at
the
lawfulness--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--the
district
court,
and
the--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--judge
wallace
has
gave
a
concurring
opinion
where
he
disagreed
with
the
ninth
circuit
expansion
of
this
particular
area,
and--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--that
was
the
district
court,
your
honor.
the...
judge
wallace
indicated
in
his
concurring
opinion
that
he
was
allowing
the
15,000
because
he
did
not
feel
it
was
abuse
of
discretion,
and
he
agreed
with
the
proportionality
analysis.
what
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
the
district
court
applied
the
correct
standard
of
grossly
disproportionate.
it
looked
at
all
the
factors
that
i've
indicated
just
now
and
came
up
with
a
decision
that
the
5,000
dollar
fine...
it
was
a
5,000
dollar
fine
under
the
guidelines,
not
250,000
dollar,
and
probation,
that
based
upon
that
he
was
going
to
add
an
additional
15,000
dollar
for
what
he
considered
what
a
small
fine
would
be
under
the
guidelines,
and
the
government
expense
in
this
matter.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
don't
really
assume
either,
but
he
has
not
met
his
burden,
your
honor.
the
defendant,
by
his
failure
to
report,
should
have
the
burden,
as
it
was
in
this
particular
case.
we
had
the
burden
to
show
that
this
money
was
lawful
and
for
a
lawful
purpose,
and
that
it
would
be
not
grossly
disproportionate.
the
defendant
should
have
the
burden
in
these
matters
when
he
commits
a
crime
and
then
tries
to
obtain
the
moneys
in
reference
to
the
forfeiture.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
yes,
that's
what
i'm
saying,
your
honor,
because
if
we're
going
to
look
at
real
comparisons,
when
you
evaluate
a
forfeiture,
it's
a
matter
of
comparing
the
value
in
reference
to
what
is
going
to
be
forfeited
to
the
serious
nature
or
extensive
nature
of
the
crime.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
that's
a
possibility,
your
honor,
but
in
the...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
think
it
is
under
this
fashion.
when
we're
examining,
your
honor,
under
a
forfeiture
statute,
it
shouldn't
be
the
district
court's
position
to
compare
what
happened
in
another
district
involving
another
factual
situation
that
could
be
entirely
different.
each
factual
situation,
because
it's
punishment
and
culpability
are
involved
and
different
values
are
involved,
have
to
be
decided
by
that
district
judge.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
well,
excessive
fines
have
been
distinguished
significantly
from
cruel
and
unusual
punishment,
your
honor,
and
the...
frankly,
i
feel
that
the
district
court
can
make
that
decision.
yes,
there's
going
to
be
differences,
but
that
district
court
has
all
of
those
particular
facts
in
that
particular
case,
and
they
would
be
best
able
to
make
that
determination
as
to
whether
a
fine
is
excessive.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
no,
i'm
not,
your
honor,
and
our
position
at
the
district
court
level
was,
we
conceded
that
the
funds
were
subject
to
forfeiture,
but
requested
a
proportionality
examination.
the
law
was
changed
significantly
in
the
interim,
where
69,000
and
el
dorado
came
out
by
the
ninth
circuit,
where
they
held
the
instrumentality
test,
and
that
test
was
used
in
reference
to
our
briefs.
i
think
a
instrumentality,
substantial
connection,
or
some
form
of
cutoff
or
threshold
is
necessary,
but
once
that
threshold
is
met,
a
standard
of
proportionality
in
criminal
in
personam
matters
needs
to
be
developed
as
to
what
is
grossly
disproportionate.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
i
think
the
district
court
did
a
good
job,
your
honor,
i
really
do,
because
they
evaluated
all
the
factors,
whether
the
money
was
lawfully
obtained--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--the
guide--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--yes.
justice
ginsburg,
the
guide
that
i
would
give,
and
based
upon
the
alexander
remand
and
busher,
and
i
do
not
mean
to
be
presumptuous,
is
looking
at
a
totality
of
the
circumstances,
the
gravity
of
the
offense,
whether
the
property
was
lawfully
obtained
and
for
a
lawful
purpose,
the
dollar
volume
of
the
loss,
the
existence
of
a
benefit
that
was
to
be
gained
by
the
defendant...
in
this
case
there
was
none...
and
whether
this
was
part
of
a
criminal
enterprise.
i'm
sure
there
are
many
more
factors
that
this
court
could
consider.
i'm
just
naming
a
few.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
there
has
not
been
one
single
case,
your
honor,
in
reference
to
that.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
after
austin
and
alexander,
where
the
court
indicated
that
fines...
that
forfeitures
can
be
considered
fines,
and
therefore
punishment
does
apply,
and
the
eighth
amendment
does
apply.
that
has
changed
things.
that
has...
in
other
words,
there
is
now
a
review
in
reference
to
excessiveness
concerning
the
eighth
amendment,
and
excessiveness
implies
an
evaluation.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
shocking?
mr.
james
e.
blatt
well,
grossly
disproportionate,
your
honor,
to
me
is
as
close
to
strict
liability
as
one
could
get.
i
think
it's
a
difficult
burden
for
a
defendant
to
meet
under
the
district
court's
standards,
in
a
district
court,
and
it's
a
word,
it's
a
concept
that
i
think
district
courts
are
familiar
with.
shockingly,
i'm
not
too
familiar
with
that.
i
would
like--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--will
shock
the
conscience?
i
like
that,
and
i
think,
your
honor,
that
taking...
no
one
is
denying
that
this...
the
government
has
a
strong
remedial
interest,
but
perhaps
there
is
something
that
shocks
the
conscience
when
lawful
money
for
a
lawful
purpose
is
taken
entirely,
without
any
concept
of
culpability,
and
i
would
respectfully
indicate
that--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--no,
your
honor.
it's
a
strict
liability
type
of
situation.
you
don't
have
to
know.
if
you
don't...
if
you
go
there
and
you
have
the
money--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--no,
i
don't
believe
that's
the
case,
your
honor.
if
you
go
out
of
the
money...
if
you
go
out
of
the
country
without
the
money...
i
mean,
without
declaring
it,
for
whatever
reasons,
ignorance
of
the
law,
not
knowing--
mr.
james
e.
blatt
--oh,
he
knew.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
no
question
about
it,
he
knew,
and
he
lied,
but
i
would
ask
the
court
to
seriously
consider
at
this
time
developing
a
proportionality
analysis.
mr.
james
e.
blatt
thank
you,
your
honor.
