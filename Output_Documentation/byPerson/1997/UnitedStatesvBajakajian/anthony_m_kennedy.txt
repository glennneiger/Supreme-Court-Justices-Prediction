justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
on
your
first
argument,
if
it's
an
instrumentality
of
the
crime
and
we
agree
with
you
on
that,
does
that
mean
the
excessive
fines
analysis
is
just
inapplicable,
or
that
it
is
presumptively
non...
not
excessive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
other
words,
the
excessive
fines
clause
analysis
applies
in
either
event.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
we
have
to
ask
about
excessiveness
anyway,
i'm
just
wondering
why
we
have
to
go
through
the
additional
step
of
elaborating
a
big
jurisprudence
on
what
is
an
instrumentality
and
what
isn't.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
in
any
event
we're
going
to
talk
about
proportionality,
maybe--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--we
should
just
save
ourselves
a
step.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
you
said
it's
presumptively
proportional.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
what
is
the
conclusion
that
you
seek
to
help
us
to
by
saying
that
it's
an
instrumentality?
we
have
a
purpose
for
these
classifications.
why
is
it
that
we're
asking
about
an
instrumentality,
in
order
to
show
the
close
connection
of
the
property
to
the
crime
itself?
i
mean,
is
that
the
object
of
the
inquiry?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
is
the
standard
abuse
of
discretion?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
abuse
of
discretion
is
to
determine
what
the
meaning
of
excessiveness
is
under
the
constitution?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
a
very
strange
doctrine,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
any
other
constitutional
provisions
that
are
entrusted
to
the
interpretation
of
the
district
courts
under
an
abuse
of
discretion
standard
that
you
can
think
of?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
why
is
it
that
a
metaphysical
label
then
changes
whether
or
not
in
fact
it's
excessive?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then...
then
i
think
you
have
to
answer
justice
scalia
that
you
cannot--
--right.
give
me
back
the
moonstone.
--necessarily
forfeit
the
moonstone.
we
get
the
moonstone
back
now.
