yes,
but
it's
as
long
as,
but
if
it's
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
why
don't
you
use
the
term
contraband,
rather
than
instrumentality,
then.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i'm
just
wondering
why
you
didn't
argue
it
in
those
terms.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
isn't
it
possible
the
report
could
be
made
the
day
after
they
arrived
abroad?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
the
offense--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
i'm
saying
is,
every
transportation
of
money
across
the
border
without
reporting
does
not
necessarily
violate
the
statute
if
within
24
hours
or
so
he
files
a
report.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
either
way--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--either
way,
the...
if
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
it
doesn't
have
to
be
absolutely
simultaneous,
i'm
not
sure
your
analogy
follows.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
under
the
income
tax
you've
got
to
make
your
report
on
such-and-such
a
day,
whenever
the
return
is
due.
what
if
this
statute
said
you've
got
to
make
your
report
on
the
same
day
you
file
your
income
tax
return
at
a
later--
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
does
culpability
have
anything
to
do
with
it?
there's
two
parts
to
that
question.
one,
is
it
relevant
at
all
that
this
fellow
told
a
number
of
falsehoods.
secondly,
is
it
relative
at
all,
relevant
at
all
that
the
money
was
acquired
lawfully
and
not
being
laundered?
are
those
two
facts
relevant
or
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
stressed
the
falsehoods
in
your
brief.
you
did
put
quite
an
emphasis
on
them.
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
he
make...
did
he
really
make
that
determination,
or
did
he
decide
he...
it
had
not
been
proved
that
it
was
unlawful?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
thought
there
was
some
ambiguity
about
the
whole
story--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--did
he
prove
that
taxes
had
been
paid
on
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
on
your
proportionality
approach?
it
seems
to
me
that
one
of
the
problems
in
this
area
is
that
it's
sort
of
a
prophylactic
statute.
we're
not
sure
what's
going
to
happen
to
all
this
money,
and
supposing
the
person
violating
the
statute
takes
the
fifth
amendment,
says
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
what
i'd
do.
i
have
a
constitutional
right
to
secrecy.
i
didn't
want...
if
i'd
filed
the
report,
somebody
would
have
found
out
about
it.
there
are
no
protections
on
secrecy.
he
just
isn't
going
to
tell,
and
the
government
has
no
way
of
finding
out.
what's
your
proportionality
analysis
there?
do
you
assume
he's
guilty
of
something
really
bad
because
he
won't
talk
about
it,
or
he's
perfectly
innocent?
