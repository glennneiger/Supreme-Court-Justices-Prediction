justice
antonin
scalia
the
argument
made
against
that
is
that
in
the
case
of
goods
brought
into
the
country
illegally
in
that
manner
it's
not
only
an
instrumentality
of
a
crime,
the
goods
themselves
are
contraband.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
no
business
being
in
the
country.
they
are
unlawfully
here.
you
could
distinguish
those
cases
on
that
basis,
couldn't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
--you'll
take
an
opinion
written
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
way
it's
delightfully
proportional,
isn't
it?
what
is
the
minimum,
10,000?
is
that
where
it
starts?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
you
take
out
just
10,000,
that's
surely
less
of
an
offense
than
taking
out
300,000,
and
if
you
take
out
only
10,
it's
a
relatively
small
offense,
you
forfeit
only
10.
if
you
take
out
300,000,
you
forfeit
300,000.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
concerned
about
this,
though.
you're
appealing
in
your
argument
on
instrumentality
to
a
doctrine
which
focuses
on
the
use
of
the
money
in
the
offense,
but
in
fact,
what
if
this
money
didn't
belong
to
this
individual?
what
if
it
belonged
to
somebody
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
is
it
not
possible
that
the
government
has
to
be
logical?
if
it
is
indeed
imposing
the
kind
of
a
penalty
that
it
did
in
customs
violations,
if
it's
moving
against
the
instrumentality,
so
to
speak,
it
has
to
move
against
the
instrumentality,
no
matter
whom
it
belongs
to.
but
what
it
says
in
this
statute
is,
if
it
belongs
to
the
person
who's
taking
it
out
of
the
country
we're
going
to
move
against
it,
but
if
it
doesn't
belong
to
him,
we're
not
going
to
move
against
it.
now,
might
there
not
be
some
requirement
that
it
be
using
that
mode
of
punishment,
moving
against
the
property?
we're
not
really
doing
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
gornstein,
i
had
always
thought
that
we
approach
this
question
of
excessive
fines
on
the
basis
of
the
statute
and
not
the
particulars
of
the
individual
case.
let's
say
a
statute
that
provides
for
a
fine
of
anywhere
from
10
dollars
to
500,000
dollars,
is
it
your
understanding
that
we
would
look
at
the
individual
case
and
the
individual
fine
actually
assessed
and
see
how
wicked
was
the
person
against
whom
the
fine
was
assessed?
did
he
lie,
did
he
do
this,
that
or
the
other
thing?
can
it
be
adjudged
just
by
looking
at
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
the
constitution
excessive
fines
clause
has
to
be
applied
on
a
case-by-case
basis,
each
individual
case?
no
matter
how
the
statute
reads,
and
even
if
the
statute
has
been
approved
in
a
prior
case,
it's
only
been
approved
as
to
that
defendant
under
the
facts
of
that
case,
and
every
single
case
involves,
necessarily
involves
courts
into
the
constitutional
inquiry
of
whether,
given
this
defendant's
culture,
given
all
the
other
circumstances
of
the
offense,
this
is
excessive?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
a
lot
of
trouble.
i
don't
know
if
courts
can
handle
that
kind
of
a
burden.
i'd
thought
it's
just
done
on
the
face
of
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
every
different
judge
can
come
up
with
a
different
conclusion,
i
suppose,
if
each
one
just
weigh,
i
think
this
is
excessive,
this
isn't
excessive.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
statute
that
says
anyone
who
uses
an
unlawfully
possessed
firearm
in
the
commission
of
a
crime
shall
forfeit
the
firearm?
is...
can
you
say
in
the
abstract
whether
that's
constitutional
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
the
existence
of
that
doctrine,
then,
that...
your
quarrel
here
is
just
that
it
is
not
a
contraband
or
instrumentality,
whatever
else
you
want
to
call
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
failure
to
register
a
firearm
is
any
different
from
failure
to
notify
the
government
that
you're
carrying
currency?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
but
if
it
is
contraband,
you
acknowledge
it
doesn't
matter
how
much
it's
worth.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
should
have
used,
you
know,
a
12th
century
valuable
firearm,
if
there
were
any
in
the
12th
century.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
isn't
that
the
case
with
respect
to
the
importation
of
goods
to
the
country
without
paying
customs
duties?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
bring
in
the
moonstone,
don't
you
forfeit
the
moonstone?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
but
so
long
as
you
make
that
limitation
upon
your
argument,
there's
nothing
wrong
about
forfeiting
something
that's
worth
an
enormous
value
so
long
as
it's
done
within
the
historical
context
of
something
that
is
called
contraband
or
instrumentality,
whatever--
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it's
worse
to
sneak
out
350,000
dollars
than
it
is
to
sneak
out
10,000
dollars?
do
you
think
that
they
are
crimes
of
equivalent
proportion?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
other
factors
being
equal,
is
it
not
worse
to
take
out
350,000
dollars
than
it
is
to...
like--
justice
antonin
scalia
--approximately
35
times
worse.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
been
enforcing
customs
laws
in
this
country
for
over
200
years.
do
you
know
of
a
single
case
in
which
the
forfeiture
of
undutied
goods
has
been
declared
to
be
an
excessive
fine,
by
any
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you're
saying
the
constitution
has
been
requiring
all
these
200
years.
