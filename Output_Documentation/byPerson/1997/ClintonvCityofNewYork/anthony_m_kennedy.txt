justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
this
more
constitutionally
defensible
than
what
we
might
call
a
pure
line
item
veto
in
which
he--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--in
which
he
can
veto
the
minute
that...
before
the
bill
ever
becomes
law,
and
is
the
reason
for
that
because
for
a
moment
in
time,
at
least,
there's
a
little
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
or
a
big
law?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
so
far
as
the
locked
box
is
concerned,
this
bill
is
the
same
as
a
line
item
veto.
i
mean,
it's
in
a
locked
box
that's
going
to
contribute
to
reducing
the
deficit.
so
that's
not
a
distinction
between
the
two.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's...
that
also
sounds
to
me
the
same
as
what
we
might
call
the
pure
line
item
veto.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
a
single,
simple
binary
choice.
sign
it
or
x
it
out.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
in
justice
breyer's
hypothetical,
you
and
he
seemed
readily
to
agree
that
we
can
just
look
at
this
as
a
delegation
problem.
from
the
taxpayer's
standpoint,
this
was
a
law
that's
been
cancelled,
and
the
taxpayer
has
an
expectation
the
law's
not
going
to
be
cancelled
unless
both
houses
of
congress
agree
on
it.
delegation
is
not
just
a
subset
of
this
larger
problem,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
don't
think
that
larger
problem
goes
away
with
justice
breyer's
hypothetical.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
of
course,
that...
this
case
is
different,
because
it
says
you
have...
you
can
either
implement
both,
one,
or
neither.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
that's
what
this
case
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
locked
box
provision
in
all
respects
constitutional,
in
your
view?
at
least
it
does
give
the
president
a
choice
between
two
different
kinds
of
laws.
he
spends
or
he
locks,
and
the
locking
mechanism,
according
to
the
government,
has
some
very
substantive,
important
effect.
it's
different
than
just
vetoing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
the
government
right
about
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
they
say
it's
now
going
to
have
legal
effect
because
it's
in
the
locked
box,
and
that's
just
a...
that's
another
legal
effect.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
different,
say,
from
simply
vetoing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
wondering,
on
your
indemnity
example,
it
would
be
at
least
premature
to
bring
it.
suppose
the
chances
were
99
percent
that
the
indemnity
would
never
have
to
be
paid,
could
you
then
sue...
oh,
well,
we
might
need
this
indemnity?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
but
it's
different,
because
your
conduct
is
affected
by
knowing
you
have
the
insurance
policy,
and
that's
not
true
here.
this
was
an
after-the-fact
enactment
by
the
congress,
so
it's
quite
a
different
hypothetical,
really.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
as
if
there
were
already
an
injury
and
there
might
not
be
a
lawsuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
no,
but
the
lockbox
puts
into
effect,
as
i
understand
it...
correct
me
if
i'm
wrong...
certain
mechanisms
under
the
budget
deficit
reduction
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
that
here
the
president
is
making
one
of
two
choices,
each
of
which
alter
the
situation
from
where
it
was
before
the
law
was
enacted
in
the
first
place.
