justice
antonin
scalia
but
mr.
waxman,
you
wouldn't...
general
waxman,
you
wouldn't
say
that
that's
remedied
if,
by
the
simple
fact
that
it
only
applies
to
later
laws
where
congress
says
he
can
do
that.
i
mean,
i
don't
see
how
that
argument
carries
any
water
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
that,
after
all,
he
cannot
exercise
this
function
on
any
legislation,
but
only
later
legislation
where
congress
chooses
to
let
him
exercise
it.
you
wouldn't
say
that
that
would
make
an
invalid
line
item
veto
provision
good,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is,
i
don't
see
how
the
fact
that
it
only
applies
to
later
legislation
where
congress
lets
it
apply
has
any
bearing
upon
either
of
those
questions.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine,
but
once
it
decides
that
it
will,
you
have
the
same
problem,
that
the...
i
mean,
you
may
argue
that
it's
no
problem
on
other
grounds,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
becomes--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no
problem
simply
because
congress
has
said
the
president
can
do
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
just
an
effect
on
congress'
own
internal
rules.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
at
least
if
you
make
some
of
those
10
not
simply
refusal
to
spend
money,
but
elimination
of
taxes.
i
mean,
you
could
get
anything
through
on
the
basis
of
the
prior
authority
the
president
has
always
had
simply
not
to
expend
money
which
congress
has
authorized
but
not...
not
compelled
him
to
spend.
that's
easy.
but
make
some
of
those
10
tax
provisions.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
is--
--you
equate
with
spending
letting
people
keep
their
money,
and
that
is
to
say,
not
enforcing
a
tax?
i
mean,
i'm
not
sure
that's
a
proper
equation.
justice
antonin
scalia
appropriations
bills
have
always
been
treated
differently,
and
when
you
extend
it
from
simple
appropriations
and
say
the
president,
even
though
it's
been
appropriated,
doesn't
have
to
spend
it,
to...
to
the
fact
he
can
be
given
the
option,
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it's
your
choice,
enforce
the
tax
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
waxman,
would
you
give...
i'm
coming
back
to
justice
breyer's
question.
would
you
give
me
something
a
little
more...
that
i
can
sink
my
teeth
into?
you've
told
me
what
these
things
that
the
president
cancels
cannot
be.
they
cannot
do
this,
and
they
cannot
do
that.
that
limits
the
universe
of
what
he
can
cancel.
now,
once
that
universe
is
limited...
they
can't
be
this
and
they
can't
be
that...
what
must
they
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
criterion?
i
mean,
to
say
you've
just
limited
the
universe
of
possible
cancellations--
justice
antonin
scalia
--anything,
the
tax
benefits
or
the
elimination
of
spending.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
criterion
when
he
selects
it?
you've
told
me
what
he
can't
cancel.
now,
how
does
he
decide
what
he
must
cancel?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
limits
the
universe.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
of
which
just
limit
the
universe.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
universe
is
limited.
we
have
the
universe.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
how
does
he
make
the
decision?
what
is
the
criterion
that
congress
has
given
him
to
pick
what
to
cancel?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
say
no.
they
say
that
the
statute...
the
provisions
he
cancels
are
not
utterly
ineffective,
that
they
still
have
some
legislative
effect,
namely
the
lockbox
effect.
what
is
your
response
to
the
lockbox
argument,
that
those
provisions
at
least
have
that
effect
of
preventing
future
appropriations?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
lockbox
applies
only
in
he
spending
area?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it
won't,
but
it
can,
can't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
which
the
president
has
to
sign.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
can
do
anything
by
passing
a
new
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
they
add
to
it,
and
the
cut
must
be
in
the
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
think
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
gee,
we
let
the
fcc
do
that.
why
wouldn't
we
trust
the
president
at
least
as
much
as
we
trust
the
fcc?
we
at
least
elect
the
president.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
many
judgments
that
the
fcc
makes
that
are
really
constrained
by
nothing
except
public
interest,
convenience,
and
necessity,
quite
a
few.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
running
riot.
it's
just
a
little
bit.
i
think
that's
what
saves
the
fcc.
well,
it
isn't
the
whole
economy.
it's
not
like...
you
know,
not
like
what
franklin
roosevelt
tried
to
do
with...
in
the
sick
chicken
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
but...
it's
very
limited.
but
this
is
very
limited,
too.
it's
just
a
certain
number
of
provisions--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
a
certain
sort.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
are
you
going
to
address
the
jurisdictional
issues?
i
hate
to
ask
this
question,
but
you
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what's
it
to
you?
[laughter]
none
of
these
provisions
directly
affect
your
client
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
helped
you
to
buy
them
by
helping
the
seller
to
sell
them--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
it
did
immediately
was
to
help
the
seller
to
sell
them.
if
we
had
the
seller
in
front
of
us,
who
said,
i'm
denied
this
tax
benefit
that
i
was
going
to
get
for
selling
the
facility,
i
could
understand
it.
but
what
if
you
had
a
tax
break
that
applied
to
somebody
who
was
about
to
buy
a
car,
and
the
automobile
manufacturer
comes
in,
he
says,
you
know,
he
didn't
buy
the
car
because
you
took
away
the
tax
break.
would
he
have
standing
to
come
before
us?
and
that's
essentially
the
position
that
you're
in.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
won't
try
to
reduce
it
to
the
absurd,
if--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
assume
it
was
a
transaction
that
was
beneficial
to
both
parties,
or
they
wouldn't
have
entered
into
it
right?
it
was
a
voluntary
deal.
why
isn't
the
seller
here?
i
mean,
you
would
think
if
this
beneficial
deal
were
destroyed
by
the
law
the
seller
would
have
had
an
objection,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
might
seem
very
reasonable
for
this
case,
but
i
really
worry
about
what
kind
of
standing
law
we
establish
if
we
say
that
someone
who
was
indirectly
benefited
by
a
tax
break
and
which...
even
if
you
add,
and
which
indirect
benefit
was
envisioned
by
congress.
congress
often
envisions
all
sorts
of
indirect
benefits
from
a
tax
break.
it's
going
to
stimulate
the
economy.
i
mean,
every...
you
know,
there'll
be
more
sales
of
hot
dogs
at
the
ball
park
or
something.
can
the
hot
dog
vendor
bring
suit?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
not
part
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
not
part
of
the
article
iii
analysis.
we
don't
ask
for
purposes
of
article
iii
whether
you're
within
the
scope
of
the
intended
benefit.
that's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
discretionary.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
goes
to
concreteness,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--right.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
no
proximity
requirement.
there's
no
proximity
requirement,
just
an
article
iii,
just
concrete
injury,
no
matter
how
remote.
if
you
can
show
that
that
ripple
in
the
pond
affected
you,
no
matter
how
remote
it
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
have
article
iii
standing?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
go
to
remoteness.
that
goes
to
whether
you
can
show
that
it
actually
hurt
you.
you
say
you...
if
you
can
show
that
it
actually
hurt
you,
no
matter
how
remote
from
the...
from
what
you're
complaining
about--
justice
antonin
scalia
it
belongs
to
your
clients,
or
does
it
belong
to
new
york
state?
i
guess
i'm
not
up
on
these--
justice
antonin
scalia
--ah,
but
that's
the
problem
in
new
york
law.
it
isn't...
in
other
words,
it
isn't
this
statute
that
prevents
the
money
from
getting
to
your
clients.
it's
a
new
york
statute,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
because
there
is
this
other
thing,
res
inter
alia...
inter
alius
acta,
right,
something
that
pertains
to
somebody
else,
you
won't
get
the
money.
what
if
you
had
a
wager
with
somebody
that
you'd
get
the
money,
and
that
cancellation
causes
you
to
lose
that
wager,
would
that
give
you
standing
to
come
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
no,
this
is
in
a
state
that
allows...
encourages
wagering,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
can
i
ask
you
one--
--and
that's
all
it
takes,
just
that
you're
hurt?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
hurt,
you
can
sue,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
injured
in
fact.
you're
way
out
at
the
edge
of
the
pond
and
a
ripple
reaches
you.
so
long
as
you
prove
that
the
ripple
reaches
you,
you
can
come
into
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
no
matter
how
many
intervening
actors,
new
york
state,
you
know,
the
agricultural
coop,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
disappointing
though,
you
know.
we
went
into
a
big
wind-up
last
year
also,
without
a
pitch,
and
you
would
have
thought
that
whoever
wanted
to
bring
it
back
would
have
gotten
somebody
who
had
been
immediately
affected
by
this
case,
and
it's
astounding
that
we
get
two
people
who
are...
you
know,
they're
down
the
line.
well,
there
are
probably
a
lot
of
people
who
don't
want
to
lose
all
their
profits
by
paying
lawyers.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
lockbox
effect?
do
you
maintain
there
is
no
effect
once
there
is
a
cancellation?
is
there
an
effect
on
what
congress
can
later
enact?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
counted
against
what
expenditures
have
been
made.
even
if
the
president
ultimately
doesn't
use
it,
it's
counted,
since
the
law
has
been
passed
which
authorized
it.
