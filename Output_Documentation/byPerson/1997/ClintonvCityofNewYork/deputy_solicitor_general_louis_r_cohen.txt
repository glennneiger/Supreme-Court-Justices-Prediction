mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
the
problem
with
the
line
item
veto
act
is
quite
basic.
the
legislative
power
is
the
power
to
write
federal
statutes
in
their
exact
final
form.
that
power
is
vested
in
congress,
nontransferably.
the
president's
role
in
the
legislative
process
is
limited
to
approving
or
returning
in
whole
each
bill
that's
presented
to
him.
the
act
gives
the
president
the
power
to
edit
tax
and
spending
bills--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes,
but
what
we
have
here,
justice
o'connor,
is
a
device
of
saying,
sign
the
bill
first
and
then
you
can
immediately
cancel
the
parts
you
don't
approve.
the
two
steps
taken
together
signing
and
cancelling,
together
produce
a
statute
that
was
not
passed
by
either
house
of
congress.
a
post-enactment
line
item
veto
is
functionally
equivalent
to
a
pre-enactment
line
item
veto.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
my
response
is
that
in
my
case,
the
snake
river
case,
where
we're
talking
about
cancelling
a
provision
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
i
don't
think
there
is
any
lockbox
effect,
but
even
in
the
spending--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
that's
right,
but
even
in
the
spending
context
a
lockbox
is
simply
a
congressional
declaration
that
it
won't
otherwise
spend
money
pursuant
to
a
provision
that
congress...
that
the
president
has
cancelled.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
it
can
by
passing
a
new
law.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
which
the
president
has
to
sign.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
i
think
that's
my
point,
that
the
president's
action
here
is
final,
and
it
takes
congressional
action
to
restore
the
appropriation
that
the
president
has
cancelled
or
the
tax
provision
that
the
president
has
cancelled.
several
of
general
waxman's
arguments
it
seems
to
me
pose
the
following
hypothetical.
he
suggests
that
because
congress
is
aware,
when
it
passes
a
later
statute,
of
the
earlier
line
item
veto
act,
it's
no
different
from
putting
a
cancellation
provision
in
each
bill.
i
think
it
is
different
in
certain
ways,
but
i
also
think
that
congress
couldn't
do
that,
either.
if
congress
were
to
pass
an
internal
revenue
code
of
1999
with
a
special
provision
saying,
the
president
may
cancel
any
one
or
more
of
the
provisions
of
this
law
if
the
cancellation
would
raise
tax
revenues
and
not
harm
the
united
states,
congress
would
be
abdicating
its
constitutional
responsibility
to
write
tax
statutes,
and
i
think
the
court
would
say
that
as
a
matter
of
article
i
law
the
congress
is
giving
the
president
something
that
the
constitution
requires
it
to
do.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i
said
not
contrary
to
the
national
interest.
i
don't
think
that
helps.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
i
think
that's
the
same.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
what
we
let
the
fcc
do
is
regulate
in
the
public
interest
as
defined
in
a
statutory
context.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
but
the
public
interest
itself
has
a
historical
and
a
statutory
context.
we
know
what
the
fcc's
responsibilities
are.
we
know
who
it
regulates.
but
i
don't
think
you
need
even
to
get
to
the
question
whether
this
is
delegation
running
riot,
because
i
think
you--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that's
right.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
it's
70--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it's
79
provisions,
79
tax
provisions.
it
could
be
179
tax
provisions.
i
don't
see
the
difference
between
this
and
passing
an
entire
code
in
which
you
say
the
president
can
cancel
any
of
the
provisions
of
this
code
if
he
determines
that
doing
so
would
not
be
contrary
to
the
national
interest,
which
is
all
that
this
statute
says,
and
i
think
what's
wrong
is
that
he
is,
by
doing
that,
producing
a
truncated
statute
that
congress
didn't
pass,
a--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--justice
o'connor,
i
think
i
win
either
way.
i
think
that
if
you
say
there's
no
substantive,
intervening
event
between
these
two
steps,
a
long-winded
president
could
take
both
steps
literally
in
the
same
breadth,
if
he
were
alone
in
the
room
he
could
sign
them
in
either
order
and
just
report
what
he's
done,
that
there
is
no
substantive
distinction,
and
that
this
is
a
device
to
get
around
what
general
waxman
concedes
would
be
unconstitutional.
but
i
also
think
that
if
you
take
that
first
step
seriously,
as
a
separate
step,
we
now
have
an
enacted
law
that
the
president
is
unilaterally
repealing.
to
be
sure,
congress
has
given
him
the
power
to
repeal
it,
but
the
question
is
whether
congress
could
constitutionally
do
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no.
first
of
all,
as
i
said
before,
justice
kennedy,
it
has
no
application
to
my
snake
river
case,
which
particularly
relates
to
the
internal
revenue
code,
but
second,
the
lockbox
i
don't
think
saves
a
bill
that
says,
you
may
declare
a
particular
provision
to
be
without
legal
force
and
effect.
the
president
isn't
deciding
to
spend
the
money
in
some
other
way.
he's
simply
cancelling--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it's
no--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
it's
no
different
from
the
legal...
i
don't
think
it's
any
different
from
the
legal
effect
of
cancelling
any
other
appropriation
which
congress
would
therefore
have
to
reappropriate
if
it
wanted
particular
money
spent.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes,
they
do,
and
i
really
think
our
standing
case
is
quite
straightforward.
congress
passed
section
968
for
the
specific
purpose
of
helping
farmers
buy
processing
facilities
through
their
cooperatives.
this
particular
farmer
and
cooperative,
mr.
cranney
and
snake
river,
were
personally
working
actively
to
buy
such
facilities
with
the
anticipated
help
of
section
968.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
somebody
who
had
taken
sufficiently
concrete
steps
toward...
toward--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--toward
buying
a
car
could
have
standing
to
challenge
the
cancellation
of
a
tax
provision
that
changed
the
price
of
the
car.
here,
the
evidence--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--congress'
finding
and
the
government's
concession
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
they
finally
made
in
their
reply
brief,
plus,
the
only
evidence,
and
there
is
evidence
in
this
case,
which
is
mr.
cranney's
declaration,
which
is
that
he
and
snake
river
were
actively
working,
that
there
had
been
two
actual
transactions,
that
one
of
the
actual
transactions
was
more
expensive
because
section
968
was
not
available,
that
they
were
working
on
another
transaction
which
was
premised
on
the
availability
of
section
968--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
he
simply
chose
not
to
litigate.
we're
not
talking
just
about
one
transaction.
cranney's
declaration
also
says
there
were
ample
other
facilities
available.
they...
and
that
snake
river
was
interested
in
buying
more
than
one
facility...
this
was--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--an
active
program
that
congress
wanted
to
assist,
and
the
assistance
was--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it's
got
to
be
sufficiently
specific,
targeted
toward
a
small
group
of
beneficiaries,
with
beneficiaries
who
are
actively
pursuing
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
we're
very
much
in
the
position
of
the
plaintiffs
in
associated
general
contractors,
the
position
of
plaintiffs
in
bryant
v.
yellen,
people
who
are
interested
in
a
business
opportunity
which
they
are
actively
pursuing,
and
an
illegal
act
concretely
and
significantly,
importantly
interferes
with
their
pursuit
of
a
valuable
business
opportunity.
each
case
has
got
to
be
judged
on
its
own
merits
on
this
kind
of
thing,
but
i
think
judge
hogan's
conclusion
that
it
was
highly
likely
that
these
plaintiffs
would
have
been
able
to
do
particular
transactions
taking
advantage
of
section
968
is
amply
supported
by
evidence
that
the
government
never
chose
to
challenge.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
oh,
i
think
that's
very
clear.
i
think
that's
very
clear.
the
congressional
sponsors
said
that.
the
structure
of
the
act
makes
that
clear.
it
singles
out...
doesn't
say
the
processor
can
sell
to
anybody
it
wants
to
and
he
gets
the
benefit.
it
says
the
processor
gets
the
benefit
selling--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the
president
agreed
to
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
you
ask
for
purposes
of
article
iii
whether
the
plaintiff
has
a
sufficiently
concrete--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--interest
so
that--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--he
would--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--personally
benefit
in
a
tangible
way--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--from
the
court's
intervention.
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
i
think
he
has
to
have...
there
has
to
be
a
realistic
possibility,
at
least,
of
a
transaction.
here
a
transaction
was
highly
likely,
and
there
has
to
be
a
significant--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
the
court's
opinion
in
bennett
v.
spear
makes
it
clear
that
you
can
have
a
chain
of
causation
and
you
don't
have
to
have
the
last
link
in
the
chain--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--thank
you.
