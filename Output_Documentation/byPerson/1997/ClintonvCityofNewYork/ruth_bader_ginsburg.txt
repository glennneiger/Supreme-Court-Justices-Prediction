well,
is
the
effect
is...
in
effect,
is
it...
it
says
the
law
is
no
longer
there.
the
law
is
no
longer
applicable.
you
can
call
it
a
different
word,
but
it's
the
same
thing.
it's
gone.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
there
anything
like,
here's
a
laundry
list
of
items,
mr.
president.
here's
a
capital
gains
treatment
for
so-and-so,
and
relief
from
taxes
from
so-and-so.
we
don't
want
to
take
the
political
heat
for
making
the
choice,
so
you
pick.
that
sounds
to
me
like
legislating.
i
mean,
whatever
legal
dressing
that
you
give
to
it,
it's
saying
to
the
president,
you
make
this
hard
choice
that
we
don't
want
to
make.
we're
giving
out
all
these
plums
to
everybody
and
we
don't
want
to
take
away
any
of
them.
you
do
it.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
relying
on
congress'
finding
that
the
way
to
help
the
farmer's
coops
is
to
give
this
break
to
the
potential
seller?
i
mean,
it
was
congress'--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
respect
whether
that
was
the
raison
d'etre
for
congress
passing
in
this.
it
wasn't
the
processor,
but
it
was
the
coop--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
why
didn't
the
state
join
this
lawsuit,
mr.
cooper?
we
don't
have
the
state
of
new
york
in
here,
and
that's
puzzling.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
then,
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--with
respect
to
the...
another
piece
of
this
threshold
issue,
you
have
no
individuals
in
this
group
unless...
you
have
a
couple
of
unions,
and
they
have
members,
so
what
is
the
harm
to
the
unions
and
their
members
that
would
give
them
standing
to
be
in
this
assemblage
of
plaintiffs?
