justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the...
i
don't
want
to
cut
you
off
because
you're
giving
other
examples,
but
i'd
like
an
example
that
is
the
closest
you
can
come
to
the
following,
that
congress
passes
a
law
that
says
next
year
mr.
smith,
mr.
jones,
and
18
other
people
will
not
have
to
pay
taxes
amounting
to
$18
million.
and
then
it
says
to
the
president,
mr.
president,
as
you
wish,
in
the
national
interest
you
can
decide
whether
mr.
smith
or
mr.
jones
or
any
group
of
the
other
18
will,
in
fact,
pay
taxes,
up
to
$10
million.
now,
is
there...
the
standard
being,
in
the
national
interest.
so
he
can
choose
to
tax
four
people,
16
people
no
people,
as
he
wishes,
without
a
standard
but
for
the
national
interest.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now,
what
example
is
there
that's
the
closest,
in
the
past,
to
the
president
having
that
kind
of
authority
to
pick
and
choose
whom
to
tax,
whom
not
to
tax,
with
the
standard
of
the
national
interest
being
the
only
control?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
exactly
right.
i'm
accepting
all
your
arguments
up
to
that
point,
hypothetically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
throughout
on
that,
on
the
particular...
it's
the
same
point,
that
i
want
to
get
something
you
almost
said,
and
you
stopped--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--just
before
you
said
it,
and
that
is
the
reason
that
the...
to
uphold
the
tax
provisions,
you
say,
is
not
to
give
the
president
total
authority
under
the
constitution
to
rule
by
decree,
should
congress
want
him
to
do
it,
because
there's
an
intelligible
principle.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
intelligible
principle,
you
say,
is
not
just,
do
what's
in
the
public
interest,
it
is...?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
one--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you
one
question
on
the
merits,
if
you're
finished
with
the
standing?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i've
one...
the
question
i
have,
which
is
really
my
only
question
here,
is
this.
assume
with
me
for
a
second
that
the
solicitor
general...
assume...
is
right
that
this
isn't
really
a
legislative
veto
statute.
that's
the
title,
but
that's
not
what
it's
about.
there
is
a
law,
a
law
of
the
united
states.
the
budget
has
been
signed.
then
the
question
is,
could
congress
delegate
to
the
president
the
authority...
and
let's
take
what
i
think
is
the
hardest
part,
the
authority
to
take
100
human
beings
that
have
received
in
100
provisions
100
tax
benefits,
all
different
ones,
and
the
congress
says
to
the
president,
mr.
president,
those
people
will
not
be
taxed
next
year,
but
we
give
to
you
the
authority
to
pick
and
choose
among
them
and
impose
certain
taxes
on
them,
according
to
a
standard.
now,
i
take
it
what
he
says
is,
the
standard
has
to
be...
it
has
to
be
really
revenue-raising,
it
can't
harm
an
essential
function,
it
has
to
be
in
the
national
interest
and,
mr.
president,
you
have
to
read
the
bill,
you
have
to
give
your
reasons,
you
have
to
look
through
the
entire
thing
carefully,
taking
into
account
its
history
and
purposes,
and
probably
a
word
that
might
come
to
mind
is,
is
it
pork?
all
right.
assuming
that
they
tell
the
president
to
do
all
that
in
respect
to
taxes,
how
is
that
different
than
telling
the
fcc
to
go
look
through
people
in
the
communications
area
and
give
licenses
or
not,
or
make
other
rules
and
regs
or
not
in
respect
to
"the
public
interest"?
if
you
can
do
the
one
under
the
constitution,
why
can't
you
do
the
other?
