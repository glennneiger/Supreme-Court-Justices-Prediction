david
h.
souter
yes,
but
not
to
repeal
the
statute,
and
i
mean,
that's
the
difference.
justice
david
h.
souter
the
examples
that
you
give
are
sort
of
the
kind
of
fact-finding
examples
in
which,
if
the
president
finds
a
given
fact
to
be
the
case,
then
a
consequence
follows
and
he
must
declare
that
consequence
and
implement
it,
but
that's
not
what
we've
got
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
i
mean,
that's
the...
you
say
it's
not,
but
that's
one
of
the
questions.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
if
the
factors
are
not
factual,
someone
would
suggest
that.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
the...
if
in
your
example
the
factors
that
the
congress
specified
were
straight
fact
as
opposed
to
normative
factors,
we'd
be
back
in
the
old
cases
that
you
and
i
referred
to
earlier,
but
if
the
example
is
a
normative
example,
as
in
the
public
interest,
then
those
cases
are
not
authority,
and
you
have,
it
seems
to
me,
a
very
different
article
i
problem.
justice
david
h.
souter
what
is
the
constitutional
distinction
between
what
you
call
law-making
and
law-repealing?
there
isn't
any.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
justice
ginsburg's
example
an
appeal
is
being
effected,
and
that
is
law-making.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
the
only
contingency
on
your
argument
is
whether
the
secretary
is
going
to
act
to
bail
you
out,
and
your
point
there
is,
the
president
in
effect
has
said
that
she
won't,
is
that
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
what's...
what
else?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay,
under
existing
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
under
existing
law.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
know,
new
york
could
change
it's
law,
too,
but
under
existing
law,
there's
the
one
contingency
left,
right,
and
you're
saying
that
does
not
count
against
us
for
standing
because
the
president
in
effect
has
said
that's
not
going
to
happen,
otherwise
i
wouldn't
be
reducing
the
deficit.
