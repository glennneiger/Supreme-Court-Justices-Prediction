mr.
charles
j.
cooper
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
certainly,
justice
o'connor.
my
friend
general
waxman
says
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
new
york
city
case
have
not
got
standing
because
they
have
not
been
denied
a
single
dollar,
and
it
is
true
that
we
haven't
been
denied
a
single
dollar,
but
we
nonetheless
have
actual
harm
and
we
have
a
very
serious
threat
of
imminent
harm.
first,
with
respect
to
actual
harm,
what
if
section
4722(c)
had
said
that
the
united
states
treasury
will
indemnify
the
state
of
new
york,
dollar
for
dollar,
for
any
lost
medicaid
funds
if
hcfa
doesn't
grant
the
waivers?
your
honor,
losing
that
insurance
policy
would
clearly
be
an
injury
to
my
clients.
the
insurance
industry
is
based
upon
the
notion
that
that
is
a
valuable
commodity,
and
trillions
of
dollars
exchange
hands
every
year
on
that
reality.
we
had
something
much
better
than
an
insurance
policy
against
loss
from
an
adverse
decision.
we
had
a
favorable
decision,
so
as
a--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
when
i
leave
this
court
i'll
get
in
my
car,
and
the
chances
are
extremely
slim
that
i
will
run
into
you,
but
i
won't
get
into
my
car
without
liability
insurance,
and
i've
paid
a
lot
of
money
for
that
liability
insurance,
your
honor.
here,
the
chances
that
they're
going
to
waive...
that
they're
going
to
deny
our
waivers
are
very
good.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--no,
there
was
an
injury
before
we
received
section
47229(c).
the
government
said
that
the
medicaid
funds
belonged
to
them
and
under
the
statute,
that
was
true.
they
were
the
property
of
the
united
states.
after
the
cancellation,
as
a
matter
of
law,
that
money
belonged
to
my
clients.
now,
once
the
cancellation
has
gone
into
effect,
the
united
states
government
again
says
that
as
a
matter
of
law,
the
medicaid
laws,
the
money
belongs
to
them.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
new
york
state
has
enacted
state
laws
that
pass
through
that
loss.
this
burden
will
land
on
our
shoulders.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
doubt
the
wager
could
be
enforced--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
we
have
much
more
than
a
wager
here.
we
have
a
law
of
many
years
standing,
or
many
laws
of
many
years
standing
in
new
york
state
which
say
that
if
these
waivers
are
denied,
if
the
taxes
themselves
are
declared
impermissible,
it
follows
as
a
matter
of
state
law
that
the
health
care
providers
must
pay...
must
essentially
give
that
money
back.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
that's
not
the
only
contingency.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
well,
congress
could
pass--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--another
law--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--under
existing
law--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
that's
true.
i
mean,
the
president
has
not
allowed
the
united
states
congress
to
grant
these
waivers.
it
is
unlikely
in
the
extreme
he's
going
to
allow
little
old
hcfa
to
grant
us
these
waivers,
and
your
honor,
the
fact
that
there
is
another
method
for
new
york
to
achieve
complete
relief
doesn't
reduce
in
any
way
the
value
of
the
method
that
has
already
yielded
complete
success.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
and
i
certainly
accept
your
vast
improvement
over
my
answer.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
excuse
me?
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
if
you're
injured
in
fact--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
wouldn't
be
making
this
argument
if
i
were
here
to
say
that
new
york
might
pass
laws
that
would
then
shift
this
burden
onto
my
shoulders.
that
would
be
speculative.
but
new
york
has
passed
the
laws,
your
honor.
this
will
happen
as
a
matter
of
law
unless
new
york
repeals
its
laws,
which
is
no
less
speculative
than
if
congress
acts
now
a
third
law
to
adjust
these
rights
and
interests.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
the
record
isn't
revealing
on
this,
and
i
have
nothing
other
than
rumor
and
speculation
to
offer
to
you
on
that
issue.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
but--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--well,
that
answer
definitely
has
some
seriousness
to
it.
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
the
back
of
the
canoe
not
pulling
an
oar
in
this
case,
your
honor--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--but
we're
injured,
and
that's
the
issue,
perhaps
downstream,
but--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--their
harm
is
one
step
farther
downstream,
i
will
grant
you.
it
is
that
the
loss
of
$2.6
billion
in
medicaid
matching
funds
is
going
to
have
a
very
real
and
very
serious
effect
on
health
care
providers
in
the
state
of
new
york
and
will
be
visited
directly
in
terms
of
the
employment
opportunities
of
those
health
care
providers
which
the
unions
represent.
but
i
don't
have
to
rely
upon
my
union
members,
in
my
opinion,
to
satisfy
the
individual
requirement
of
the
line
item
veto
act.
that
term
is
amenable
to
an
interpretation
that
it
would
include
the
other
clients
that
i
represent,
justice
ginsburg,
and
to
interpret
it
the
way
general
waxman
suggests
would
really
be
quite
absurd.
it
would
make
no
sense
at
all
for
congress
to
want
this
case
in
this
court
for
resolution
of
this
constitutional
issue
as
quickly
as
possible
and
then
say
only
natural
persons
can
take
that
expedited
route,
and
all
other
persons,
municipalities,
states,
my
clients,
have
to
go
through
a
lengthy
sojourn
through
the
normal
litigation
process,
including
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
i
certainly
am.
i'd
love
to
get
to
the
merits,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
we
don't
tell
the
fcc
that
it
can
rescind
a
law,
that
it
can
render
a
law
of
no
force
and
effect.
that's
what
congress
has
told
the
president
he
may
do.
general
waxman
has
said
that
repeals
must
satisfy
the
presentment
clause,
and
there's
no
room
for
general
waxman
or
anyone
else
to
argue
otherwise.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
let
me
answer
this,
what
different
effect
would
there
be
if
the
statute,
instead
of
using
the
term
cancel,
and
defining
it
to
mean
repeal,
had
said
repeal?
there
would
be
no
difference
in
the
operation
of
this
statute.
and
with
respect
to
the
lockbox
specifically,
your
honor,
that
simply
makes
clear
that
the
president
has
only
a
repeal
power.
he
doesn't
have
a
power
of
revision.
he
can't
take
that
money
and
do
something
he
would
prefer
to
do
with
it,
and
neither
can
congress.
but
if
congress
wants
to
spend
that
money
again,
whether
it's
in
a
lockbox
or
not,
what
does
it
have
to
do?
it
has
to
pass
a
new
law.
and
without
the
lockbox
that
would
be
true.
with
the
lockbox,
that
is
true.
the
only
difference
is,
it
may
well
be
that
they
have
to
add
another
sentence
to
the
statute
that
they
enacted.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
yes.
well--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--your
honor,
i
have
to
confess
i've
never
met
anyone
who
understood
entirely
the
operation
of
the
lockbox,
but
it...
one
thing
that
simply
cannot
be
escaped
or
blinked
is
the
fact
that
when
the
president
cancels
a
provision,
under
the
act
itself,
it
extinguishes
the
authority.
it
extinguishes
the
law
itself.
that
operates
on
the
law,
not
the
money.
this
isn't
a
spending
discretion,
and
the
solicitor
general
has
made
a
very
powerful
presentation
for
the
proposition
that
congress
can
give
sweeping
spending
authority
to
the
president
and
has
since
the
first
congress.
we
don't
resist
that.
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
your
honor,
i
honestly
am
not
entirely
sure,
but
i
will
grant
the
solicitor
general
that
it
may
well
be
that
that
money
is
treated
differently
than
if
it
had
never--
mr.
charles
j.
cooper
--yes,
but
i
think
it's
a
function
of
fact
that
the
money
came
into
existence,
the
authority
to
spend
the
money
came
into
existence,
which
is
the
only
difference
between
that
and
a
true
line
item
veto,
so
that
reality
is
what
gives
rise
to
the
necessity--
