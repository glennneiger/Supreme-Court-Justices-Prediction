mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
constitutional
principles
of
separation
of
powers
govern
both
the
standing
and
merits
issues
of
the
case.
with
respect
to
standing,
this
court
recognized
last
term
in
raines
v.
byrd
that
the
article
iii
inquiry
is
especially
rigorous
when
plaintiffs
challenge
the
allocation
of
constitutional
power,
yet
here,
in
the
new
york
case,
the
state,
which
is
not
even
a
party,
has
not
been
denied
a
single
dollar
in
medicaid
reimbursement
and
the
secretary
of
hhs
has
not
even
determined
that
it
should.
in
snake
river,
the
plaintiffs
include
no
entity
whose
taxes
could
possibly
be
affected
by
the
challenged
cancellation
and
they
have
not
shown
that
the
cancellation
interfered
with
any
transaction
from
which
they
likely
would
have
benefited.
on
the
merits,
the
president's
cancellations
violated
neither
article
i
nor
the
separation
of
powers.
the
presentment
clause
was
fully
satisfied
when
the
president
signed
the
balanced
budget
and
taxpayer
relief
acts
making
them
laws.
when
the
president
subsequently
cancelled
sections
4722(c)
and
968,
he
was
not
returning
portions
of
the
presented
bills
while
signing
other
portions
into
law.
he
was
implementing
a
limited
discretionary
authority
to
execute
the
law
as
it
had
been
enacted
by
congress.
cancellations
under
the
line
item
veto
act
do
not
prevent
congress
from
making
whatever
laws
it
wants.
congress
could
readily
have
exempted
sections
4722
(c)
and
968
from
the
president's
authority.
it
chose
not
to
do
so
and,
indeed,
it
identified
section
968
in
the
taxpayer
relief
act
as
an
item
subject
to
cancellation.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
the
critical
reason
is
the
point
i
just
identified,
which
is
in
a
true
line
item
veto,
which
everybody
understands
is
unconstitutional,
the
congress
does
not
retain
control
to
determine
which
spending
or
tax
items
the
president
can't
cancel.
if
the
president
has
the
authority...
and
this
is
critical.
if
the
president
has
the
authority
to
cancel
a
provision
before
it
becomes
a
law,
under
the
presentment
clause
he
can
cancel
a
designated
tax
or
spending
item
and
then
sign
the
law
and
congress
has
thereby
deprived
itself
of
the
opportunity
to
create
the
law.
here,
the
president
signs
the
law
and
it
becomes
a
law
under
the
presentment
clause,
and
when
he
does
so,
if
the
law
contains
a
designated
cancellable
item,
congress
has
made
a
law
telling
the
president
that,
subject
to
certain
determinations
and
certain
considerations,
and
certain
certifications,
you
have
a
single,
binary
choice.
you
can
either
spend
the
money
as
provided,
or
you
can
spend
it
for
deficit
reduction
by
putting
that
money
into
a
lockbox,
and
in
that
manner
the
president
is
executing
the
law
that
congress
has
enacted,
not
vetoing
an
item
or
repealing
a
provision
that
congress
has
enacted.
it's
no
different,
i
sus...
i
suggest,
for
article
i
purposes,
than
if,
instead
of
enacting
the
line
item
veto
act,
congress
had
simply
decided
to
put
in
as
section
1
of
every
spending
and
taxing
bill
that
it
enacts
what
is
now
section
961
of
the
line
item
veto
act.
it
says,
we
have
the
following
spending
and
taxing
provisions,
but
subject
to
these
articulable
principles
and
these
constraints,
the
president
may
decide,
if
he
signs
this
law,
not
to
do
certain
things.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
the...
i
think
it's...
the
lockbox
feature
of
this,
which
is
the
feature
that
gives
the
president
a
single
binary
choice,
tends
to
make
this
much
less
of
a
delegation
problem
under
separation
of
powers
than
might
otherwise
exist,
because
in
contradistinction
to
cases
in
which
the
court
has
upheld,
for
example,
delegation
of
authority
to
the
fcc
or
the
sec
to
essentially
create
an
entire
code
of
conduct
for
the
securities
industry,
the
line
item
veto
act
is
not...
and
in
this
respect
i
think
it's
unique
and
uniquely
constrained.
it's
not
self-executing.
the
president
can't
do
anything
with
his
cancellation
authority
unless
congress
subsequently
passes
an
act
that
has
a
cancellable
item
in
it
and
does
not
provide
that
the
president's
authority
will
not
be
subject
to
cancellation.
it's
almost
the...
a
mirror
image
of
the
impoundment
control
act.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
problem...
the
constitutional
deficiency
in
the
line
item
veto,
the...
a
pure,
a
true
item
veto,
is
that
it
violates
the
presentment
clause,
which
provides,
among
other
things,
that
the
bill
that
the
president
signs
making
it
a
law
has
to
be
the
bill
that
each...
a
majority
of
each
house
of
congress
enacted,
and
if
the
president
can
excise
a
provision
before
he
signs
the
law,
that's
violated
and,
as
this
court
has
indicated--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
if...
there
are
two
bases
for
a
constitutional
challenge
to
this
authority.
one
is
under
article
i
and
whether...
and
asks
the
question
whether,
in
fact,
the
operation
of
this
statute
violates
the
formal
requirements
of
the
presentment
clause
or,
in
effect,
effects
a
repeal.
the
other
large
issue
is
whether
this
represents
a
violation
of
the
separation
of
powers
as
applied
to
congress
through
the
"non-delegation
doctrine",
and
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
if
it...
it
has
a
bearing
on
the
article
i
issue.
i
don't
think
that
the
timing
of
this
relates
to
the
scope
or
breadth
of
the
delegation
except...
i
take
that
back.
i
think
it
relates
to
both.
what
congress...
by
making
this
bill...
this
act
forward-looking,
what
it
basically
is
saying,
congress
has
reserved
for
itself
the
right,
in
every
subsequent
spending
or
taxing
bill
that
has
a
cancellable
provision,
to
decide,
at
the
time
that
it
passes
those
bills,
whether
it
will
or
will
not
allow
the
president
to
exercise
that
authority.
now--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--there
are
many
historical
examples
where
congress
has
given
the
president
authority
to,
if
you
will,
repeal
the
effect
of
a
prior
enacted
statute,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i...
with
all
due
respect,
justice
souter,
this
is
not
a
repeal
of
a
provision.
repeals
of
provisions
of
acts,
or
acts
themselves,
have
got
to
follow
the
presentment
clause.
there's
no
question--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
let
me
try
and
explain
why
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
justice
ginsburg,
let
me
try
and
respond
to
these
two
questions
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
under
the
lockbox
provisions
of
691c,
a
cancelled
provision
does
retain
real,
legal
budgetary
effect.
it
removes
the
amount...
that
amount
of
money
under
gramm-rudman-hollings
and
the
budget
enforcement
act
from
congress'
ability
to
spend
that
equivalent
amount
of
money.
under
the
budget
enforcement
act,
ordinarily,
if
a
particular
provision
were
vetoed,
or
not...
money
were
not
used
by
the
president,
congress
has
the
authority,
up
to
the
budget
baseline,
to
enact
another
provision
and
spend
that
money.
a
cancellation
of
a
provision
in
this
act
requires
that
that
money
be
devoted
to
deficit
reduction,
so
first
of
all
it
is
not
true
that
it
has
no
remaining
effect,
but
even--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
not.
the
budget
enforcement
act
as
amending
the
gramm-rudman-hollings
act
of
1985
are
statutes,
laws
that
bind
congress
and
the
president.
they
provide
mandatory
sequestration
authority
in
the
president
and
in
congress
in
the
event
that
the
baseline
is
exceeded,
and
what
the
lockbox
provision
of
the
line
item
veto
act
does
is
to
say,
if
this
is
not
an
issue
of
whether
the
president
wants
to
implement
this
provision
or
not.
the
president
must
implement
this
provision
in
accordance
with
the
law
that
congress
enacted,
and
that
means
that
you
can
either
spend
the
money,
give
effect
to
this
provision
to
build
a
new
dam
in
west
virginia,
or
take
the
money
that
would
have
been
spent
for
that
and
put
it
in
the
deficit
lockbox
which,
under
the
budget
enforcement
act,
means
that
you
cannot
by...
enact
a
compensating
piece
of
legislation
to
otherwise
spend
the
money.
it
reduces
the
amount
of
money
that
congress
and
the
president
can
spend.
but
even
if
it
didn't
have
that
effect,
we
think
that
even
without
the
lockbox
provision
this
act
would
be
constitutional,
because
there
are
many
examples,
and
i
respectfully
submit
that
they
are
not
all
so
easily
distinguishable,
justice
souter,
of
instances
where
congress
has
given
one
of
the
other
two
branches
the
authority
to
take
acts
unilaterally
that
repeal
not
the
provision
but
the
effect
of
the
provision.
i
mean,
maybe
the
best
example
is
the
rules
enabling
act,
which
provides
under
28
u.s.c.
section
2072b,
that
the
court
may
promulgate
rules
for
the
district
courts
of
procedure
and
evidence
and
that
any...
and
that
those
rules
will
v.
degas--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
breyer,
the
question
that
you're
raising
is
raising
a
question
not
under
article
i
but
under
the
delegation
doctrine.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
understand--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'll
bank
that.
[laughter]
the...
under
the
delegation
doctrine,
the
question
always
is,
after...
well,
at
least
in
this
century,
whether
congress
has
supplied
an
intelligible
principle
or
whether,
as...
under
the
test
that
this
court
frequently
announces,
it
is
constitutionally
significant
if
congress
clearly
delineates
the
general
policy,
the
public
agency
that
is
to
implement
the
policy,
and
the
boundaries
of
the
delegated
authority.
now,
in
your
question
you
have
posited
an
example
in
which
congress
has
given
the
president
no
intelligible
principle
other
than
the
national
interest.
i
think
that
raises
a
much
more
difficult
question
than
we
have
here,
because
an
argument
could
be
made
that
the
president
is
constitutionally
required
to
act
in
the
national
interest,
but
the
issue
would
be,
is
the
principle
sufficiently
intelligible.
now,
the
best
cases
that
we
have
for
the
historical
precedence
for
giving
the
president
discretionary
authority
to
cancel
limited
tax
cuts
or
revenue-generating
or
nonrevenue-losing
provisions
would
be
the
cases
that
are
recited
in
j.
w.
hampton
and
in
skinner,
where
the
president
was
often
authorized
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
collect
duties
or
tariffs
and
several
of
these
temporary
provisions
were
permanent,
and
i
think...
you
know,
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
were,
and
the
issue...
sometimes
the
determinations
were
specifically
outlined,
as
in
field
v.
clark,
where
it
was
very
specific,
and
sometimes
they
were
very,
very
general,
and
the
issue
then
is
only
whether
the
president
has
a
sufficiently
intelligible
principle.
you
know,
what's
interesting
about
these
old
cases,
and
there
are
many,
many
of
them,
is
that
these
were
authorities
that
the
president
was
exercising.
this
was
discretion
he
was
exercising
at
a
time
in
our
country
before
we
had
an
income
tax
and
when
in
general
the
very
large
portion
of
the
federal
revenues
were
raised
by
tariffs
and
custom
duties.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that
it
would.
i...
there
are
two
different
bases
for
constitutional
challenge.
one
which
i
was
discussing
with
justice
breyer
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
delegation
of
authority
that
exceeds
what
congress
may
do
under
the
separation
of
powers
clause.
the
other
constellation
of
issues
relate
to
article
i,
and
i
respectfully
suggest
that
with
respect
to
these
limited
tax
cuts
the
article
i
problem
is
even
less
than
with
respect
to
the
other
provisions,
because
this
is
not
an
example
of
the
president
repealing
a
provision
of
the
law
that
congress
has
enacted.
with
respect
to
the
limited
tax
cuts
under
section
691f,
the
joint
committee
on
taxation
is
required
to
go
through
and
specify
in
the
actual
tax
bill
which
provisions
of
the
bill
are
limited
tax
cuts
subject
to
the
president's
cancellation,
so...
and
that's
exactly
what
was
done
in
this
case
in
the
taxpayer
relief
act.
there
is
a
provision
in
which
the
congress
has
said,
attention,
mr.
president,
please
look
at
the
following
provisions.
these
are
limited
tax
cuts
as
to
which
you
will
have
cancellation
authority
if
you
wish
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it...
what
it
demonstrates,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
is
that
what
the
president
is
doing
is
not
repealing
a
provision
of
a
law
that
congress
has
enacted,
but
executing
a
discretionary
authority
that
congress
has
given
him.
let
me
give
you
an
example
that
was
helpful
to
me
when
i
first
started
thinking
about
this
problem.
if
congress
enacted
a
law...
and
there
is
a
very
precise
historical
precedence
for
this.
congress
passed
a
law
that
contained
10
different
spending
items,
but
they
put
a
provision
in
that
basically
said,
in
legalese,
look,
mr.
president,
we
think
all
10
of
these
projects
are
worthwhile,
but
we're
very
concerned
about
the
deficit,
and
we
don't
really
think
that
the
country
ought
to
be
funding
more
than
eight
of
them.
use
the
following
factors
and
pick
whichever
eight
of
the
10
you
want.
nobody,
i
suggest,
would
suggest
that
there
is
an
article
i
problem
there.
the
president--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
again,
this
court
in
skinner
stated
that
the
standard
for
separation
of
powers
analysis
with
respect
to
tax
provisions
is
no
different
than
it
is
with
respect
to
spending
provisions
or
any
other
provision
in
the
constitution
under
article
i.--
that
is,
the
same
standard
of
nondelegation
applies,
and
it
applies
with
particular
force
here
because
in
the
tax
provision
the
line
item
veto
act
provides
that
the
congress
will
specify
for
the
president
in
the
actual
bill
that's...
taxing
bill
that's
presented
to
him
which
items
he
should...
he
may
or
may
not
cancel.
now,
that
may
be...
that
may
leave
a
delegation
doctrine
issue
if
you
think
that
he
doesn't
have
sufficient
intelligible
principles,
but
it
is
not
a
question
of
the
president,
by
exercising
a
discretionary
choice
that
congress
gives
him
in
the
law
that's
passed,
an
article
i
problem,
unless
i'm
seriously
astray.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
and
what's
troublesome
about
your
example,
justice
ginsburg,
relates
not
to
article
i,
because
the
law
has
been
passed
and
signed
by
the
president,
but
to
the
separation
of
powers.
congress
cannot,
we
know,
delegate
its
law-making
power.
it
can't
delegate
the
authority
to
make
the
laws,
and
if
it
just
passes
a
law
that
says,
here
are
two
things
we
think
are
really
nice,
but
we
don't
really
have
the
money
to
spend
and
you
just
pick
whichever
one
you
want,
i
think
the
court
would
appropriately
say,
look,
the
congress
has
delegated
its
law-making
function
because
it
has
not
provided
a
"intelligible
principle"
by
which
the
executive
can
exercise
his
discretion.
in
this
case--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--between
law-making
and
law--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
congress...
there
is...
it
is
not
our
contention
that
a
repeal
of
a
law
can
be
effectuated
by
any
means
other
than
those
specified
in
article
i.--
it
is
our
contention,
justice
souter,
that
when
congress
passes
a
law
that
contains
two
spending
or
taxing
or
tax
cut
provisions
and
says
to
the
president,
with
whatever
principles
or
not,
you
may
choose
which
one
of
these
to
execute
and
which
one
not
to,
the
president
is
exercising
a
discretionary
authority
that
congress
has
given
him,
and
if
they've
given
him
sufficient
intelligible
principles,
it's
constitutional.
now,
in
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
first
of
all,
the
line
item
veto
act
applies
to
three
very,
very
specifically
defined
provisions
relating
to
spending
and
revenue
that
account
for
a
very
small
portion
of
the
federal
budget
deficit,
and
it
provides
that
before
an
item
will
be
cancellable
it
must
satisfy
each
of
three
criteria,
and
even
if
it
does,
the
president
must
make
three
different...
make
certain
determinations.
he
must
take
into
consideration
a
number
of
factors
that
are
specified,
and
he
must
identify
for
the
congress
a
number
of
factors
in
his
cancellation
message.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
there
would
be
a
different
question...
we
might
be
prepared
to
defend
it,
but
there
would
be
a
different
question
if
the
president
was
given
the
authority
to
cancel
existing
items
of
direct
spending,
which
would
be
the
equivalent
of
the
repeal
of
the
effect
of
a
prior
law.
here,
we're
only
talking
about
new
spending,
discretionary
spending
and
new
items
of
direct
spending
account
for
one-third,
approximately
one-third
of
the
federal
budget.
the
discretionary
spending
part
is
the
same
authority
that
the
presidents
have
clearly
had
since
the
first
congress
not
to
spend
the
full
amount
of
appropriated
funds
or
to...
you
know,
to
act
with
almost
complete
discretion
under
lump
sum
appropriation
authority.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
there
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
justice
scalia,
i...
i
was--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we're
not
saying
that.
it's
not
our
position
that,
because
the
president
has
had
historical
discretionary
authority,
when
congress
has
given
it
to
him,
to
decline
to
spend
items
or
to
abolish
agencies,
or
transfer
agency
functions,
therefore
there's
no
difference
with
taxes.
the
point
i
was
making
with
the
chief
justice
was
the
analogy
between
discretionary
spending
and
what
the
law
calls
new
items
of
direct
spending.
with
respect
to
the
tax
provisions,
this
ship
is
prepared
to
stand
on
its
own
bottom,
which
is,
we
think
that
there
is
independent
historical
precedent
for
congress
giving
the
president
the
discretionary
authority
to
decline
to
implement
certain
revenue
provisions
upon
the
application
of
certain
intelligible
principles.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
thank
you.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
intelligible
principle
is
that...
first
of
all,
in
order
for
there
to
be
a
targeted
tax
cut,
there
has
to
be
a
baseline
tax,
but
the
president
must
determine,
number
1,
that
cancellation
will
reduce
the
federal
budget
deficit,
and
this
is
not,
by
the
way,
as
the
other
side
contends,
an
ipso
facto
claim,
because
many
tax
provisions
are
enacted
on
the
notion
and
on
the
budgetary
assumption
that
they
will
generate
additional
economic
activity
and
raise
taxes,
and
in
that
instance
the
president
would
not
be
able
to
make
that
determination...
raise
money
and
provide
more
taxes.
secondly,
he
must
determine
that
it
will
not
impair
any
essential
government
function,
that
it
will
not
harm
the
national
interest,
and
in
making
those
determinations
the
president
is
directed
to
consider
the
legislative
history,
the
construction
and
purposes
of
the
law
which
contains
the
item
to
be
cancelled,
which
might
relate,
in
the
case
of
the
state--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he
has
5
days
after
he
signs
the
bill,
which
would
give
him
a
maximum
of
10
days.
now,
in
the
context
of
the...
in
the
regime
of
the
budget
enforcement
act
and
gramm-rudman-hollings,
where
omb
and
cbo
are
required
to
make
daily...
weekly,
if
not
daily
calculations
about
where
we
are
in
terms
of
the
budget
baseline
and
the
spending
caps,
there
is
a
very
important
purpose
to
be
served
by
requiring
the
president
to
decide
yes
or
no,
whether
or
not
a
particular
item
will
be
cancelled,
and
then
to
give
the
congress
the
authority,
particularly
with
respect
to
annual
appropriations
bills,
to
try
and
file...
to
enact,
consider
and
enact
a
disapproval
bill.
i
mean,
the
irony
of
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
they
must--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--are
we
talking
about
tax
benefits
here?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
the
president...
the
only--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--he
must
determine,
number
1,
is
this
a
cancellable
item,
which
in
the
case
of
tax
provisions,
he's
helped
with
by
the
legislation
he's
considering.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
because
congress
tells
him
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right.
second
of
all,
he
must...
he
cannot
cancel
unless
he
makes
the
three
determinations
that
i've
said.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
right,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
right,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--may
i
answer?
he
is
given
in
the
statute
a
multitude
of
factors
that
he
must
consider
and
certify
to
congress,
and
within
that
realm
he
has
discretion,
much
less
discretion
than
the
fcc,
or
the
sec,
or
the
icc
have
been
given.
thank
you.
