well,
technically
the
president
has
to
sign
it,
so
it
goes
into
effect,
so
you're
really
having
to
deal
with
what
happens
after
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
your
argument
rest
on
our
determining
that
somehow
we
look
at
it
all
together
and
decide
that
the
article
i
requirements
were
never
met
in
the
first
place,
or
that,
okay,
it
went
into
effect
and
it's
an
unconstitutional
repeal?
