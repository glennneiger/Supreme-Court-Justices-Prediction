paul

how
much
time
does
he
have
to
make
these
determinations?
justice

stevens
mr.
cooper,
i
don't
know
why
you
didn't
accept
the
wager
hypothetical.
it
seems
to
me
a
wager's
a
lot
like
a
lawsuit,
that
if
you
have
a
lawsuit,
a
wager
pending
which
you
may
win
or
may
lose
and
congress
passes
a
law
and
says
you
lose,
it
seems
to
me
you're
hurt.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
think
a
wager's
a
very
good
example,
is
what
i'm
suggesting.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you,
mr.
cooper,
because
i
frankly
am
troubled
with
this
lockbox
idea,
but
is
it
any
different
if,
after
the
particular
item
is
put
in
the
lockbox,
than
if
it
had
never
been
enacted
in
the
first
place
and,
if
so,
what
is
the
difference,
the
particular
provision
that
goes
into
the
lockbox?
