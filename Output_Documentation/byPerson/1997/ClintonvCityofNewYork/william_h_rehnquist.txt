hear
argument
now
in

william
j.
clinton
v.
the
city
of
new
york.
general
waxman.
chief

h.
rehnquist
but
those
were
based
on
factual
determinations
that
the
president
was
entitled
to
make
under
the
statute,
weren't
they?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
that
affect
a
constitutional
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
general
waxman,
you
say
it
applies
only
to
a
very
small
amount
of
spending,
but
if
we
uphold
it
here,
it
could
then
be
extended
to
a
vast
amount
of
spending.
i
don't
see
that's
a
constitutional
distinction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
waxman.
mr.
cohen,
we'll
hear
from
you.

--thank

rehnquist
mr.
cooper,
we'll
hear
from
you.
since
we're
already
on
the
subject
of
standing,
why
don't
you
start
with
that
for
the
new
york
petitioner...
the
respondents.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cooper.
the
case
is
submitted.
