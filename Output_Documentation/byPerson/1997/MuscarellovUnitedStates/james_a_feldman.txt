mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
haven't...
i'm
not
aware
of
the
continued
use
of
that
phrase,
no.
the
government's
position
is
that
congress
used
the
term,
carries
a
firearm
in
section
924(c)
in
its
ordinary
sense,
to
refer
to
all
of
the
means
by
which
a
firearm
would
ordinarily
be
said
to
be
carried.
now,
it
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
a
lot
depends
on
when
it's
asked.
if
you
imagine
a
case
where
a
policeman
stops
a
motorist
and
says...
walks
up
to
the
motorist
and
says,
are
you
carrying
a
firearm,
i
don't
think
the
motorist
would
have
to
stop
to
think
if
he
wanted
to
answer
honestly,
is
it
on
my
person,
did
i
put
it
on
the
seat,
is
it
in
the
trunk
or
in
the
glove
compartment,
did
i
lock
the
glove
compartment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
you
don't
think...
i...
well--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--at
least
our
feeling,
and
it's
consistent
with
standard
dictionary
definitions,
that
if
you
ask
someone
if
they're
carrying
a
gun
in
their
car
they
would
say
either
yes,
or
no,
depending
on
whether
the
gun
was
in
the
car.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
i
think
the
same
answer
would...
i
think
the
same
answer
would
be
true
even
if
you
said
if
you're
carrying
a
gun,
in
a
circumstance
where
you're
talking
about
where
that
seems
the
reasonable
reference.
if
you're
talking...
going
up
to
someone
walking
on
the
street,
they'll
likely
interpret
that
to
mean
on
the
person.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
our
position
is
that
congress
intended
it
to
refer
to
both,
and
that
movement
is--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
and
i'll
tell
you
why.
ordinarily
the
word
carry,
with
its
etymological
roots
and
its
many
common
usages,
refers
to
locomotion,
but
because
common
experience
tells
us
that
people
move
a
lot,
unlike
vehicles,
which
sit
parked
in
garages
or
at
the
curb
for
long
periods
of
time,
i
think
the
concept
that
you
have
to
have
movement
at
a
particular
moment
with
a
person
has
kind
of
dropped
out
or
become
vestigial.
and
as
a
result
when
it's
talking
about
carrying
it
on
a
person,
although
in
point
of
fact
if
movement
were
required
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference,
because
people
do
move,
and
the
inference
that
someone
has
moved,
if
they
have
one
on
their
person,
would
be
very,
very
strong,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes,
and
my
only
qualification
i
would
give
for
that,
if
the
defendant
is
just
storing
a
gun
in
the
car
in
his
garage,
for
example,
i
don't
think
that
he's
carrying
it.
if
the
car
is
in
the
process
of
moving
from
one
place
to
another
and
stops
at
a
red
light
for
a
minute,
or
is
in
the...
a
process
of
movement--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--right.
at
that
time
i
would
say
he's
still
carrying
it.
if
there's
a
course
of
movement
that's
going
on
and
this
is
part
of
it
i
think
the
defendant
is
still
carrying
it
at
that
time.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
carry
and
transport,
as
the
dictionaries,
as
every
dictionary
i
think
recognizes,
there
is
a
lot
of
overlap
between
the
terms,
but
there's
a
couple
of
features
that
clearly...
i
think
three
things
that
clearly
distinguish
them.
first,
carry
requires
that
the
person
who's
carrying
it
accompany
the
item
that's
carried.
i
don't
think
transport
requires
that.
second,
carrying
is
more
commonly
used,
and
this
may
be
just
a
question
of
connotations,
but
where
the
person
who's
doing
the
carrying
also
intends
to
use
it,
it's
much
more
common
to
say
that
it's
carried
than
used,
and
an
example
i'd
give
simply
would
be,
if
you're
talking
about
a
flashlight
that
maybe
in
the
glove
compartment
of
a
car,
it
would
be
unusual
for
somebody
to
say,
i
transport
a
flashlight
in
the
glove
compartment
of
my
car.
i
don't
think
it
would
be
unusual
to
say,
i
carry
a
glove...
a
flashlight
in
the
glove
compartment.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
it's
usually...
those
cases
are
resolved
in
terms
of
who
has
dominion
and
control
over
the
gun.
it
may
be
one
or
the
other,
or
both.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i...
you
know,
i
don't...
ordinarily
it
would
be
the
driver,
but
it
could
easily
be
the
passenger
too,
or
instead
of.
it
depends
on
whose
gun
it
was,
whether
the
passenger
knew
the
gun
was
in
the
glove
compartment,
a
number
of
factors.
in
other
words,
in
order--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--it
could
be
both,
also.
generally
speaking
possession,
i
think,
is
necessary
for
either
use
or
carrying,
and
that
would
be...
you
have
to
look
and
see
who's
exercising
dominion
and
control,
but
they're
both
responsible
for
the
movement
of
the
car
and
the
movement
of
the
gun.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
our
position
is
that
it's
still
being
carried.
it's
still
being
carried
because
if
the
gun...
it
may
or
may
not
be
in
relation
to
a
drugtrafficking
offense,
but
if
the
gun
is
being
moved
from
one
place
to
another
so
that
it
can
be
of
use
and
available
in
a
drugtrafficking
crime,
then
it
is
being
carried.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
don't--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think...
let
me
approach
that
in
two
ways.
one
is,
the
case
with
the
caboose,
i
do
think
that
would
be
a
carry,
but
the
term,
the
fact
that
the
term
carry,
when
you
get
a
vehicle
that's
sufficiently
large,
the
queen
elizabeth,
or
something
like
that,
whether...
the
defendant
is
in
one
place,
the
gun
is
in
another,
whether
the
term
carry
has
some
fuzziness
in
that
kind
of
a
case
i
don't
think
should
affect
the
fact
that
in
a
case
like
these,
which
is
where
you
have
it
in
a
vehicle
and
where
i
think
it
would
ordinarily
be
said
that
the
gun
is
carried--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i...
yes.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
is
strange,
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
i
do
think
what
congress
was
getting
at
was
the
act
of
taking
that
gun
to
the
scene
of
a
drug
transaction,
just
as
the
defendants
were
doing
here,
and
it
was
not
material
to
congress
whether
defendants
did
that
in
a
suitcase,
on
their...
in
a
pocket,
in
the
car,
in
the
trunk,
or
on
the
seat.
they--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
true,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right,
and
i
think
that
that's
crucial,
because
what
congress...
as
this
court
i
think
recognized
in
bailey,
what
congress
was
concerned
about
was
not
just
criminalizing
their
possession
of
someone
who
keeps
a
gun
in
their
house
and
who
then...
they
were
worried
that
that,
the
fact
that
someone
keeps
a
gun
in
their
house
should
not
be
a
predicate
liability
here
if
it
has
no
other
relationship
to
the
crime
or
if
it's
just
a
matter
of
intent.
but
where
someone
takes
the
intentional
act
of
taking
the
gun
and
taking
it
with
that
person,
as
these
defendants
did,
so
it
would
be
at
the
scene
of
the
crime...
in
fact,
in
the
case
of
cleveland
and
gray,
it
would
be
essential
to
commit
that
crime
because
they
were
intending
to
rob
drugs
from
another,
a
dealer,
then
i
think
that
is
the
crime
that
congress
was
trying
to
get
at.
it
was
trying
to
get
at
the
conduct
that's
preparatory
to
the
use--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
i
would
point
out...
i
can.
an
example
would
be
where
you
refer
to
it,
where
you
display
it,
perhaps
in
some
circumstances
where
you
trade
somebody
for
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--no,
well,
for
example,
if
it's
sitting
on
a
table
in
your
house
and
sitting
out
there
on
the
table
while
you're
doing
the
drug
transaction,
or
not
in
your
house,
or
some
other
location,
i
think
that
you
might
be
referring
to
it
or
displaying
it,
but
i
don't
think
you
would
be
carrying
it.
but
i
would
also
point
out
that
i
think
that
the
same
view
would
hold
true
if
you
adopt
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
your--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--your
honor,
i
was...
i
answered...
i
meant
to
refer
to,
if
it's
sitting
on
a
table,
for
example,
and
the
drugs--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
we
would
take
the
position
that
it
is
if
the...
if
you
imagine
a
case
where
the
drugs
are
being
dealt
right
there,
the
gun
is
sitting
on
the
table,
it's
a
very
powerful
message
to
whoever's
on
the
other
side
of
the
table--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--well,
grab...
again...
you're
right,
the
circumstances
could
vary,
but
perhaps
somewhere
where
it's
available.
it's
quite
clear
out
there
in
the
open
where
the
dealer
can
deal
with
it
and
not
the
adversary.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
the
train,
perhaps
you're
right,
it
may
be
it
would
only
be
an
extraordinary
circumstance
where
a
train
had
a
case
like
that
where
it
would
be
said
to
be
carried.
i'm
really
not
sure.
as
far
as
on
the
person,
i
do
think
that
congress
intended
to
use
the
term
in
all
of--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
was
going
to
say,
i
think
congress...
our
basic
submission
is
that
congress
intended
to
use
the
term
in
all
of
the
ways
in
which
the
term
would
ordinarily
be
used
to
talk
about
carrying
and
when
it's
on
the
person,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
there
had
to
be
movement,
it
really
wouldn't
make
very
much
difference.
i
guess...
i
think
that
because
of
common...
under
common
experience
people
do
move
very
frequently,
the
word
no
longer
requires
much
in
the
way
of
movement
at
a
particular
moment
when
it's
on
the
person,
but
if
the
court
were
to
hold
otherwise
that
would
be
satisfactory
with
us.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think...
i
guess
i
think
congress
did,
and
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in
the
numerous
authorization
statutes
that
we
cite
congress
plainly
intended
to
use
the
word
carry
to
refer
to
all
of
those
things.
there
are
numerous
statutes
that
authorize
federal
officers
to
carry
firearms.
but
equally
important,
state
law
consistently
recognizes
that
carry
can
be
used
to
mean
all
of
those
things
in
a
wide
range
of
different
contexts
and
statutes,
and--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right,
and
that
is...
that
is
certainly
a
separate
qualification,
and
things
like
immediate...
not
immediate
accessibility,
maybe,
but
a
degree
of
accessibility
may
be
relevant
for
whether
it's
in
relation
to
a
drugtrafficking
crime.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
in
our
view,
both
cases...
i
mean,
our
primary
submission
here
is
that
both
cases
would
plainly
be
carrying,
because
when
he
drives
off
in
that
vehicle
he's
carrying
the
car,
the
gun
in
his
car.
but
i'd
like
to
make
one
other
point
about--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
agree
with--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--but
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
we
are
trying
to
use
the
greater
to
include
the
lesser
here.
i
think
you
could
construe
those
statutes
that
way,
but
you
also
could
look
at
those
dozens
of
statutes
and
say
that
congress
used
the
natural
word
there,
carry,
to
refer
to
a
whole
variety
of
things
that
they
were
referring--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--your
honor,
i
would
think
it
would,
but
not
in
this
case,
because
i
don't
think
there
is
any
ambiguity,
any
substantial
ambiguity
in
the
question
of
whether
you
can
be
said
to
carry
something
in
a
vehicle.
i
think
that
that's
clarified
by
all
of
the
ordinary
canons
of
statutory
interpretation.
i'd
like
to
make
one
point
related
to
the
state
laws,
which
is
petitioners
argue
that
congress
was
unaware
of
all
these
numerous
state
laws
and
therefore
we
shouldn't
pay
any
attention
to
them
in
construing
section
924(c).
well,
when
congress
enacted
section
924(c)
in
1968
it
said
the
statute
provided
for
prohibition
of
carrying
unlawfully
during
a
predicate
offense.
when
they
said
carry
unlawfully,
they
were
exactly
intending
to
pick
up,
and
they
knew
that
they
were
intending
to
pick
up
state
law
on
carrying.
an
unlawful
carry
was
a
carry
that
was
primarily
in
violation
of
state
law.
there
were
very
few
federal
laws
that
governed
carrying
at
the
time.
now,
there's
no
denying
that
in
1968
there
were
numerous
state
statutes
that
prohibited
carrying
in
a
vehicle,
and
when
congress
removed
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
right,
and
it
was
only
the
ones
they
were...
they
were
referring
to
state
law
which
plainly
recognizes
that
carrying
can...
some
states
it
could
refer
to
a
vehicle,
some
states
it
couldn't,
but
the
term...
the
ones
that
we've
heard
of
person
say,
carry
on
a
person,
and
the
ones
that
require
immediate
accessibility
say,
carry
about
a
person.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
i
think
there
would
be
ample
notice.
as
i
said,
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
think
if
someone
were
to
read
this
statute
and
take...
and
say
to
his
confederate
in
crime,
say,
well,
you
know,
let's
make
sure
that
we
have
the
gun
on
the
seat
of
the
car
and
not
in
your
pocket,
because
if
it's
in
your
pocket
you're
going
to
be
carrying
it
when
we're
driving
to
the
drug
deal,
i
think
that
would
be
a
pretty
improbable
event,
that
most
likely
someone
would
read
the
statute
and
say,
there's
a
severe
penalty
that
congress
has
imposed
for
this,
and
we
should
make
sure
that
we're
not
carrying
it,
and
we
can't
carry
it
in
the
car,
we
can't
carry
it
on
our
persons,
we
can't
carry
it
in
any
way.
i
just
want
to
add,
though,
about
state
law
that
when
congress
removed
the
requirement
of
unlawfully
in
1984
they
were
plainly
intending
to
broaden
the
reach
of
the
statute,
and
so
it's
really
just
a
little
question
that
from
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
in
1968
until
the
present,
it's
referred
to
carrying
in
a
vehicle
as
well
as
carrying
on
a
person.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
you
certainly
could.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
petitioners
have
argued
that
we
should...
that
the
court
should
construe
the
term
carry
narrowly
because
the
court
adopted
a
narrow
construction
of
the
term
use
in
bailey,
but
i
think
that
would
be
turning
the
reasoning
of
bailey
on
its
head.
one
of
the
reasons
why
the
court
in
bailey
construed
the
term
use
a
little
bit
narrowly
was
to
still
leave
some
room
for
carrying.
that
principle
shouldn't
be
applied
here
to
construe
the
term
carrying
narrowly
and
therefore
leave
a
complete
gap
in
the
statute
for
things
that
people--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct,
but
the...
but
nonetheless,
when
you're...
it's
true
that
there
are,
and
those
offenses
cover
somewhat
different
conduct.
they
cover
people
who
give
somebody...
who
consign
something
to
be
transported,
and
also
people
don't...
people
don't
accompany
the
item,
and
also
that--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--they'd
cover...
i
think
they'd
probably
cover
most
of
this,
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--the
transportation
statute,
924(b),
which
is
the
one
that's
been
referred
to
earlier
today,
requires
that
the
crime
be
committed
therewith.
you're
transporting
it
with
intent
that
the
crime
be
committed
therewith,
and
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
would
cover
these
cases
or
not.
it
would
depend
on
whether
the
crime
was
actually
being
committed
with
the
gun,
or
whether
the
gun
was...
it
was...
whether
the
gun
was
being
carried
in
relation
to
the
crime.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
and
that's
why
i'm
not
sure
as...
it
may
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
i'm
not
sure
whether
the...
whether
those...
what
occurs
here
and
what
occurs
in
the
majority
of
924(c)
cases
would
be
covered
by
the
other...
by
924(b).
mr.
james
a.
feldman
right.
right,
but
it's
the
point...
the
offense
has
to
be
committed
with
the
gun,
and
that
is
not
the
formulation
that
congress
used
in
924(c),
where
it
said
during
and
in
relation
to.
the
gun
has
to
be
carried
during
and
in
relation
to.
but
i
think
most
significantly
924(b)
is
a
broader
statute
because
transport
is
a
broader
statute
and
as
i
said,
where...
what
congress
had
in
mind
was
that
the
defendant
him
or
herself
is
going
to
be
the
one
who
not
only
has
the
gun
in
the
car,
but
then...
with
the
idea
that
it
will
be
used
at
some
later
date,
i
think
it's
much
more
natural
to
use
the
word
carry
than
transport,
which
refers
just
to
the
bare
movement
from
one
place
to
another
for
some
purpose
or
for
somebody
else
to
use
it
or
for
all...
for
all
kinds
of
other
possible
reasons.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
you
know,
i'm
not
really
aware
of
exactly
how
that's
been
interpreted
in
a
case
like...
i
guess...
if
i
can
be
permitted
i'd
guess
at
it,
but
i'm
not
sure
it's
going
to
be
borne
out
by
whatever
cases
have
come
up,
which
is
in
muscarello's
case
it
may
be
difficult
to
show
that
it
was
transported,
that
the
crime
would
be
committed
with
the
gun,
because
the
gun
was
there
to
provide
him
protection
during
the
crime.
in
cleveland
and
gray's
case
i
think
probably
it
would
be,
because
they
were
going
to
use
the
gun
in
order
to
rob
the
dealer
and...
to
steal
drugs
from
another
drug
dealer,
and
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
believe--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
don't
know...
i
don't
know...
it
may
be
that
there's
an
overlap
and
there's
other
statutes
in
title
18
that
would
cover
the
conduct
of
these
defendants,
and
there's
a
very
broad
range
of
different
kinds
of
cases
that
come
up
under
924(c),
but
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
the
term
carry
is
naturally
used
to
carrying
it
in
a
vehicle.
it's
been
used
that
way
since
1968.
there's...
no
court
has
ever
said
that
it's
not
used
that
way,
and
i
think
that's
a
reflection
of
the
way
that
term
would
ordinarily
be
used
and
ordinarily
understood
by
congress
at
that
time
and
at
each
of
the
times
that
it's
amended
the
statute
since
then.
and
for
that
reason
i
don't...
i
think
that
congress
was
very
concerned
with
seeing
to
it
that
the
conduct
that
leads
up
to
the
possible
use
of
a
gun,
this
was...
the
carrying
offense
is
really
meant
to
kind
of
take
care
of
the
preparation
for
use,
and
for
congress
it
was
of
no
moment
whether
someone
takes
a
gun,
puts
it
in
an
attache
case,
locks
it,
and
carries
it--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--that's
correct,
but
for
instance,
if
the
offense
is
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
that's
a
crime
that
can
be...
that
can--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i'm
talking
about
in
preparation
for
the
use.
i'm
really
not
talking
about,
here,
in
preparation
for
the
crime,
and
i
think
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
was
that
if
someone
takes
a
gun
in
preparation
to
commit
a
drug
offense
and
puts
it
in
a
suitcase...
cleveland
and
gray,
for
example,
in
this
case
had
taken...
they
took...
they
planned
to
rob
the
other
dealers.
they
put
the
gun
in
a
bag.
they
put
it
in
the
trunk
of
their
car
and
waited
for
the
call
to
determine
the
rendezvous
point
where
they
would
meet
them.
now,
if
they
had
instead...
and
it
happened
it
was
far
enough
away
they
needed
to
take
the
car,
so
they
got
in
the
car
and
drove
there.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
but
their
drug
crime
was
attempted
possession
with
intent
to
distribute.
it
was
going
to
be
their
attempt
to
get
the
drugs.
but
if
they
had
carried...
the
rendezvous
point
had
been
a
couple
of
blocks
from
where
they
were
and
they
had
carried
the
bag
in
their
hands
rather
than
in
the
trunk
of
the
car,
it
would
have
made
no
difference
from
what
congress
was
trying
to
get
at
in
this
statute.
what
they
were
concerned
was
getting
that...
people
taking
that
gun
to
the
scene
of
the
crime
and
especially
as
this
court
has
interpreted
use,
i
think
they
didn't
want
to
have
to
wait
until
someone
actually
pulls
it
out
and
starts
using
it
in
a
very
active
sense
in
order
to
say
that
that...
we
want
to
keep
that
gun
away
from
that
drug
offense,
and
whether
they
take
it
there
in
their
car,
or
take
it
there
in
a
bag
i
don't
think
was
of
great
significance,
nor
should
be
in
interpreting
the
statute.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes.
i
think...
is
it
always
transportation?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
no,
it's
not
always--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--yes.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that
may
be
true.
i'm--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--my
answer
is
no.
my
answer
is
no
for
another
reason
as
well,
which
is,
as
i
said,
i
think
transportation
doesn't
require
that
the
defendant
accompany
the
gun,
and
i
think
carrying
does
require
that
the
defendant
accompany
the
gun.
and
again,
that
points
out
why
the...
the
seriousness
of
this
offense
and
the
reason
why
congress
wanted
to
get
at
carrying,
which
is,
they
were
concerned
with
the
defendant
taking
the
gun
along
so
that
it
would
be
there
and
available
for
use
at
the
time
when
the
defendant
is
prepared
to
commit
a
drug
deal
to
possess
the
drugs,
to
rip
off
another
dealer,
to
sell
the
drugs,
whatever
it
is
the
defendant--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
yes,
it
was.
mr.
james
a.
feldman
because
i
don't
think
it
requires
that
you
accompany
the
item
that's
being
transported,
unless
i'm
misunderstanding
your...
in
other
words,
i
think--
mr.
james
a.
feldman
--carrying
usually
involves
transporting
it,
but
transporting
it
does
not
always
involve
carrying
it.
i
don't...
does
that
help?
mr.
james
a.
feldman
that's
correct,
and
i
think...
i
didn't...
there's
certainly
a
great
overlap
between
the
two
words,
but
there
are
some
different
uses.
for
example,
where
you
take
a
gun
to
have
it...
to
transport
it
to
somebody
else
in
another
state,
but
you're
not
going
to
accompany
it,
i
don't
think
you'd
say
that
you're
carrying
it
in
that
case.
so
there
are
differences
between
the
two
statutes,
and
there's
reasons
why
congress
would
have
chosen
to
treat
them
differently.
i
also
think,
though,
that
where
it's
ultimately
intended
that
the
person
who's
doing
the
carrying
is
going
to
be
the
one
who's
doing
the
using
also,
it's
much
more
natural
to
refer
to
carry
rather
than
use,
as,
for
example,
you
carry...
as
i
said
before,
you
carry
a
pen
in
your
pocket,
you
carry
a
flashlight
in
your
glove
compartment.
you
could
say
you're
transporting
the
flashlight,
but
i
think
it's
much
more
natural
to
say
that
you're
carrying
it.
thank
you
very
much.
