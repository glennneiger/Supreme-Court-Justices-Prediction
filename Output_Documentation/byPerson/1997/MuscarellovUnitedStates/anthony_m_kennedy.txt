with
reference
to
carry,
the
definition
of
firearm
includes
a
missile,
a
rocket
launcher--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--do
you
have
to
carry
the
rocket
launcher
in
your
vest
pocket?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
then
if
you
had
a
land
mine
in
your...
in
the
trunk
of
your
car
or
in
the
back
of
the
utility
vehicle,
that
would
be
carrying
it?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
there
are
some
kinds
of
firearms
that
cannot
be
carried
and
therefore
there's
no
violation
of
the
statute,
in
your
view?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
are
there
any
statutes
in
which
congress
has
defined
something
like
firearm,
punishing
its
carrying,
but
then
the
firearm
is
so
defined
that
it
cannot
be
carried?
i
don't
understand
how
that
works.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
it
follows
from
your
analysis
that
the
informed
drug
dealer
will
have
a
drug...
will
have
a
gun
in
his
car
at
all
times,
when
he
goes
shopping,
when
he
goes
to
church,
and
when
he
distributes
the
drugs.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
if
we
had
just
the
word,
in
relation
to,
i
should
think
that
the
modifying
phrase
has
something
more
than
a
temporal
aspect
to
it,
that
it's
pragmatic
as
well
if
it...
it's
accessible
if
it
facilitates
the
drug
offense.
during
does
seem
to
be
mostly
a
temporal
term.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
under
your
view,
can
you
give
me
an
example
of
where
you
are
not
carrying
a
firearm
but
you
are
using
it,
so
that
we
can
give
each
of
the
terms
in
the
statute
an
independent
force?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
how
can
you
do
that
if
it's
not
in
your
car
or
on
your
person?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
may
i
go
back
to
the
provision,
for
transportation
with
intent
that
the
crime
be
committed
therewith.
would
that
intent
element
be
satisfied
if
they
transported
knowing
that
they
might
need
to
use
the
gun,
but
hoping
that
they
might
in
fact
be
able
to
commit,
their
crime
without
it?
would
the
intent
element
be
satisfied
with
that
state
of
mind?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that
does
argue,
then,
for
a
comparatively
narrow
reason,
narrow
reading
of
carry.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
you
don't
need...
you
don't
need
the
broad
reading
of
carry
to
get
the
kind
of
instance
which,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
most
of
our
hypotheticals
have
been
describing.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
in
the
great
runofthemind
cases
the
gun
is
in
the
glove
compartment,
or
in
the...
in
a
bag
under
a
newspaper
on
the
passenger
seat
within
easy
reach,
or
even
in
the
trunk.
we
don't
have
too
many
cases...
just
like
we
don't
have
too
many
cases
with
missiles,
we
don't
have
too
many
cases
with
guns
in
cabooses,
and--
