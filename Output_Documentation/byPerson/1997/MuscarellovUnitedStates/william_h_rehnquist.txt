chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
96-1654,
frank
muscarello
v.
united
states,
and
number
96-8837,
donald
e.
cleveland
and
enrique
graysantana
v.
united
states.
mr.
klonoff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
every
case,
mr.
klonoff,
where
you
have
a
drug
in
the
trunk...
a
gun
in
the
trunk,
a
gun
in
the
glove...
someone
carried
it
and
put
it
there,
so
under
your
analysis,
much
would
depend
on
how
we
define
in
relation
to.
i
mean,
how
far
back
can
you
go.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
klonoff.
mr.
zalkind,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
going
to
be
fine
lines
we
have
to
draw
no
matter
whose
version
of
the
statute
we
interpret.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say,
are
you
carrying
any
money
to
somebody,
and
even
though
they're
standing
still
they
would
say,
yes,
i
am
carrying
money.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
zalkind.
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
feldman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
mr.
feldman,
do
you
know
if
criminals
still
talk
about
packing
heat,
or
has
judge
kozinski
been
watching
too
many
bogey
movies?
i--
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
the
government
has
some
problem
just
in
the
colloquial
sense
of
the
word.
you
ask
a
person,
are
you
carrying
a
gun,
you
know,
and
the
person
i
think
ordinarily
thinks
that
means
on
your
person.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
not
sure
i
agree
with
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
my
eight
colleagues
do,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you
ask
them
if
they're
carrying
your
gun
in
the
car,
yes.
but
what
if
you
ask
them
just,
are
you
carrying
a
gun?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
about--
--but
if
he--
--the
overlap
between
carry
and
transport?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
your
definition
is
really...
adds
very
little
to
the
word...
makes
carry
very
little
different
from
possess.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
movement
is
the
only
thing
that
makes
it
different,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
wouldn't
have
it
on
the
table
so...
when
either
person
can
grab
it.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
there
is
this
amount
of
different
possibilities
in
the
meaning
of
ambiguities,
then
surely
the
rule
of
lenity
comes
into
play
somewhere.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
don't
need
a
gun
to
commit
the
basic
offense--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
preparation,
but
the
statute
says
during
and
in
relation.
you
say
during
any
crime.
surely
the
during
has
a
different
connotation
than
preparation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
oh,
you're
talking
not
just
a
carry--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
robbery
is
a
separate
offense.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
isn't
the
drug
crime.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
klonoff,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klonoff.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
