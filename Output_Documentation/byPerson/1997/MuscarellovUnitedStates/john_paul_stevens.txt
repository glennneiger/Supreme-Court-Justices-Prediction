justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
were
also
state
statutes
that
were
limited
to
carrying
on
the
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
just...
i
just
want
to
clear
up
one
very
small
point
that
i
was
unclear
about
your
answer
to
justice
kennedy.
you
don't
take
the
position,
do
you,
that
the
two...
the
term
use
and
the
term
carry
are
mutually
exclusive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
could
do
one
thing
that
would
violate
both.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
on
the
state
statutes
let
me
ask
you
this
question.
there
are
several
state
statutes
that
say
carry
on
the
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
not
agree
that
if
you're
correct
the
words,
on
the
person
in
those
statutes
are
redundant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
at
least
some
states
thought
carry
was
broader
than
on
a
person.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
one
other
thing
that's
kind
of
puzzled
me?
in
our
opinion
in
bailey
we
said
that
a
person
puts
a
gun
next
to
him
during
the
transaction,
it
just
sits
there,
that's
not
use,
and
one
reason
why
it's
not
use
was,
that
would
leave
no
room
for
carry
to
cover
that
situation.
do
you
think
that
situation
is
covered
either
by
carry
or
use?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
puts...
the
defendant
puts
a
gun
into
a
place
to
protect
drugs
or
to
embolden
himself,
were
the
court's
words,
and
we
all
signed
on
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
was
saying
the
reason
that
we
don't
want
to
read
it
as
use
is,
that
would
mean...
it
would
leave
no
room
for
carry
to
cover
that
situation.
