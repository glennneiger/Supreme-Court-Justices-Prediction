what
about
judge
trott's
view
that
whatever
line
is
drawn
here
it
would
make
no
sense
to
say
to
the
savvy
criminal,
hide
the
gun
and
you're
home
free.
just
don't
keep
it
on
your
person.
keep
it
where
you
can
get
at
it
when
you
need
it.
would
that
be
a
sensible
line
to
attribute
to
congress?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
what
about
the
government's
argument
that
your
client
loses
in
any
case,
because
your
client
went
to
a
shop,
purchased
a
gun
for
the
specific
purpose
of
having
it
with
him
in
this
drug
deal,
carried
the
gun
in
his
hand
to
the
car,
so
your
client,
whatever
it
might
be
in
another
case
where
the
gun
was
just
in
the
car,
your
client
carried
the
gun
to
the
car.
justice

so
you
say
that
doesn't
present
a
carry
problem.
it
is
carried,
but
not
in
relation
to.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
you
accept
the
kozinski
line
that
it's
not...
doesn't
have
to
be
on
the
defendant's
body,
but
if
it's
right
next
to
him
where
it's
within
handsreach--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
if
a
defendant
starts
out
with
the
gun
in
his
pocket,
and
in
the
course
of
the
ride
to
the
scene
of
the
deal
puts
it
on
the
seat,
then
the
statute
doesn't
apply?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
is
carry
during
and
in
relation
to,
and--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
was
the
one
part
of
your
brief
that
stymied
me
was
the,
and
you
said,
well,
as
far
as
cleveland
is
concerned,
he's
out
because
he
carried
the
gun
from
the
shop
to
the
car,
and
i
thought,
trying
to
fathom
what
line
a
sensible
congress
would
draw,
it
wouldn't
make
a
distinction
based
on
whether
it's
the
shop
clerk
that
carries
the
gun
and
puts
it
on
the
seat,
or
the
defendant
purchased
the
gun
and
carried
it
out
himself.
