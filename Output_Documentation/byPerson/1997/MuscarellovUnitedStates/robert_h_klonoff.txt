mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
this
case
raises
the
issue
left
open
in
bailey
v.
united
states,
what
it
means
to
carry
a
firearm
under
18
u.s.c.
924(c)(1).
petitioner
submits
that
for
four
principal
reasons
carries
a
firearm
means,
bears
a
firearm
on
one's
person.
first,
the
plain
meaning
of
the
phrase,
carries
a
firearm,
directly
supports
petitioner's
position.
dictionaries
repeatedly
and
consistently
equate
carries
a
firearm
with
having
a
firearm
on
the
person.
second,
the
government
has
not
cited
a
single
dictionary
that
defines
the
phrase,
carries
a
firearm,
to
mean
transporting
or
possessing
a
firearm
in
a
vehicle.
instead,
the
government
improperly
isolates
the
word
carry,
rather
than
looking
at
the
specific
context,
carries
a
firearm,
but
although
the
term
carry
has
multiple
definitions,
this
court
has
made
clear
in
deal
v.
united
states
and
elsewhere
that
when
a
dictionary
offers
multiple
definitions,
all
but
one
of
those
meanings
is
ordinarily
eliminated
by
context.
here,
the
context
is
carries
a
firearm.
third,
the
government's
view
would
make
carries
a
firearm
the
same
as
transporting
a
firearm,
but
section
924(b)
and
numerous
other
gun
provisions
use
the
word
transport,
showing
that
congress
knew
how
to
get
across
the
concept
of
transport
when
it
wanted
to.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
there
are
a
whole
variety
of
provisions,
justice
souter.
i
guess
one
that
comes
to
mind
is
18
u.s.c.
926
(a),
which
talks
about
transporting,
shipping
or
receiving
a
firearm
or
transporting
a
firearm
for
any
lawful
purpose
from
any
place
where
he
may
lawfully
possess
and
carry
such
a
firearm.
that
is
the
closest
analogy.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
no,
it
does
not
use
that--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--not...
transporting,
shipping
or
receiving
for
any
lawful
purpose
from
where
he
may
legally
possess.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
not
in
that
precise
terminology,
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
we
think
that
it
would.
in
fact,
the
government
itself
in
its--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
i
understand,
but
the
during
and
in
relation
to
is
a
separate
component,
but
in
terms
of
the
meaning
of
the
word
carry
we
think
that
it
is
instructive
to
look
at
the
other
statutes.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
oh,
i
agree
with
that
point,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
no,
there
are
not.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
there's
no--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--there's
no
statute
precisely
like
that,
your
honor.
that
is
the
answer.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
yes.
there
is
a
broad--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--no,
and
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
there
are
some
types
of
firearms
as
defined
in
921
that
you
couldn't
physically
have
on
your
person,
of
course.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct.
of
course,
the
definition
of
firearm
in
921
is
for
the
entire
chapter
44,
and
it's
not
surprising
that
there
may
be
situations
that
don't
fit
every
circumstance,
and
that
would--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--it
would
not
be.
our
definition
of
carrying
is
limited
to
on
the
person.
there
are
some
kinds
of
firearms--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
there
could
be
a
violation
for
using
in
those
circumstances,
or--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--exactly,
under
other
provisions,
so
there
are
a
number
of
ways
you
could
get
at
the
same
conduct.
if
congress
wanted
to--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
it
only...
as
i
said,
it
only
applies
to
a
small
number
of
the
firearms
contained
with
the
definition
of
921(a)(3),
and
again
we
don't
think
it
at
all
surprising
that
when
you
have
a
statute
that's
applied
to
the
entire
firearms
chapter,
that
there
may
be
one
or
two
types
of
firearms
as
defined
that
you
could
not
physically
carry
on
your
person.
that
is
a
problem
for
congress
to
fix
under
the
proposed
legislation,
which
would
expand
to
include
possession.
that
would
be
encompassed,
and
i
would
submit
that's
a
problem
that
congress
has
to
fix.
there
are
some
oddities
of
the
statute
under
any
possible
interpretation,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
mere
fact
that
some
conceivable
type
of
firearm
could
not
be
carried
on
the
person
should
inform
this
court's
interpretation
of
the
words,
carries
a
firearm.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
judge
trott's
analysis
is
entirely
flawed.
if
the
court
looks
at
his
opinion,
he
talks
about
the
absurdity
of
a
situation
where
somebody
has
a
gun
on
his
person
and
then
puts
it
on
the
car
seat
and
all
of
a
sudden
he's
scott
free.
that's
not
at
all
the
position
we're
arguing.
we're
not
focusing
entirely
on
the
point
of
arrest,
and
if
the
government
can
prove
to
the
jury
that
the
individual
had
the
firearm
on
his
person
at
some
point
during
and
in
relation
to
the
crime
at
issue,
he
would
be
prosecuted.
so
in
judge
trott's
example,
there
is
adequate
evidence
under
petitioner's
definition
of
carries
a
firearm
to
convict
that
person.
now,
let
me
just
respond,
though,
to
your
honor's
question.
i
submit
that
judge
kozinski
has
it
right
in
terms
of
what
the
everyday
criminal
thinks,
and
he
thinks
of
carrying
a
firearm
as
packing
heat,
and
i
would
give
the
court
an
example
that
illustrates
the
point.
two
individuals
are
in
a
car.
they're
on
the
way
to
engage
in
a
bank
robbery
and
they're
very
close
to
the
scene.
the
gun
is
under
the
back
seat,
or
in
the
trunk,
or
wherever.
one
individual
says
to
the
other
as
they're
getting
ready
to
pull
up,
hey,
are
you
carrying
the
gun?
where
the
gun
is
in
the
trunk
or
in
some
other
place,
no
one
would
say,
yes,
i'm
carrying
the
gun.
he'd
say,
no,
it's
in
the
trunk.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
depending
on
the
crime.
for
a
crime
of
possession
with
intent
to
distribute,
that's
correct.
he
had
the
gun
on
his
person.
he
would
be
carrying
it.
he
could
have--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--yes,
during
and
in
relation
to.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
under
our
view
yes
if...
as
long
as
the
government
can
also
show
the
during
and
in
relation
to,
and
for
example,
a
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
situation,
where
you're
putting
drugs
in
the
car,
you're
putting
your
gun
in
the
car,
seems
to
me
there's
more
than
sufficient
evidence
there,
and
again,
that's
why
i
think
judge
trott's
analysis
is
faulty,
because
in
many
of
those
situations
you
will
have
sufficient
evidence
of
carries
a
firearm
on
the
person.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
that's
correct,
your
honor.
that
is
true.
in
our
case,
though,
there
was
a
gun
in
the
locked
glove
compartment.
there's
no
evidence
of
when
it
was
put
there,
and
the
government
couldn't
conceivably
make
the
argument
that
that
gun
was
carried
to
the--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--if
he's
reading
up
on
the
statute
that
might
be
correct,
but
again,
that's
a
problem--
[laughter]
and
that
goes
back
to
what
judge
trott
said.
but
the
point
is,
is
that
those
oddities,
we
submit,
are
for
congress
to
fix.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
again,
that's
contextual--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--and
i
our
point
is,
is
when
you're
talking
about
the
phrase--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
there
are--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--there
are
several.
first
of
all,
under
the
government's
own
theory,
since
movement
is
required,
if
an
individual
was
sitting
on
a
couch
and
the
gun's
next
to
him,
he's
not
carrying
it,
so
there's
immediate
access
but
the
government
says
it's
not
carried.
secondly,
it's
not
clear
whether
the
government's
position--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--exactly,
that's
right.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
i
think
it
does.
for
example--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--i
don't
think
the
government's
position
applies
to
a
passenger.
i
think
it
only
applies
to
the
person
in
control,
so
you'd
have
an
odd
situation
of
the
gun
sitting
next
to
the
passenger
who's
orchestrating
the
entire
drug
transaction.
he's
not
carrying
it,
but
the
driver
would
be.
if
i
could
save
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
thank
you.
the
government's
argument
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
where
are
the
anomalies
in
the
government's
position,
the
government
really
couldn't
answer
what
happens
when
a
car
is
stopped,
and
if
it
does
apply,
then
the
whole
theory
of
transportation
makes
no
sense.
the
government
couldn't
answer
the
train
hypothetical.
these
are
going
to
create
enormous
linedrawing
problems
for
the,
for
future
courts.
the
government
really
couldn't
explain
the
passenger
situation.
where
does
this
rule
get
them
if
the
only
person
that
can
be
charged
under
that
theory
is
the
driver,
so
we
would
submit
that
the
government--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--there
are
cases
of
guns
in
ships
and
trains,
and
there
are
many,
many
cases
of
guns
in
the
back
seat
between
the
passengers,
and
the
government's
position
is
anomalous
there.
now,
in
response
to
justice--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--exactly.
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question...
this
points
up
justice
souter's
point
about
the
reason
for
construing
carry
narrowly...
the
government
does
prosecute
transport
in
precisely
these
circumstances.
we
cite
in
our
reply
brief
united
states
v.
albaron,
the
fourth
circuit
case,
exactly
the
same
situation,
gun
in
a
glove
compartment
on
the
way
to
a
drug
transaction,
so
there
are
statutes
to
get
at
precisely
this
situation.
in
terms
of
the
state
statutes,
we
would
disagree
with
the
government's
position.
the
congress
was
not
incorporating
the
whole
sweep
of
state
statutes.
it
would
be--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--there
are
a
few.
most
of
the--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--those
few
statutes.
there
are
many
statutes
that
say--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
most
of
the
states
say
on
or
about,
and
many
of
them,
22
of
them,
and
they're
cited
in
the
cleveland
brief,
say
on
or
about,
or
including
broadly,
in
the
vehicle.
now,
those
22
states
would
be
surplusage
under
the
government's
position.
you
wouldn't
need
to
say
in
the
vehicle.
so
the
overwhelming
weight
of
the
state
statutes,
we
submit,
supports
our
position
and
not
the
government's,
and
at
most,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
questioning
i
think
by
the
chief
justice,
all
you
get
from
looking
at
the
state
statutes
ultimately
is
an
application
of
the
rule
of
lenity.
there
is
no
way
that
you
come
to
the
conclusion
that
the
government's
position
is
unambiguous,
so
we
submit
that
that
whole
exercise
simply
demonstrates
why
the
petitioner
should
prevail.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
well,
i
don't
believe
that
the
court
was
referring
to
the
situation
where
the
gun
was
just
laying
there
in
terms
of
carry.
the
examples
of
carry--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--right,
but
the
court
was
not
describing
carry
there.
every
time
the
court
used--
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
--well,
i...
respectfully,
justice
stevens,
i
would
submit
that
the
court
was
not
in
any
way
suggesting
that
carry
cover
that
situation.
the
court's
examples
of
carry
in
bailey
were
always
in
reference
to
on
the
person.
mr.
robert
h.
klonoff
thank
you.
