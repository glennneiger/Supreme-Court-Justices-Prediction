justice
antonin
scalia
for
an
unlawful
purpose,
you
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
for
a
lawful
purpose.
for
a
lawful
purpose?
it's
a
crime
to
transport
it
for
a
lawful
purpose?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it--
--that's
a
crime?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
realize
we'd
gone
that
far
yet.
[laughter]
in
any
case,
i
take
it
the
other
references
to
transport
as
a
prohibition
did
not
make
the
limitation
that
this
prohibition
has
on
carries.
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
still
don't
think
you're
understanding
justice
souter's
point.
he's
saying
that
just
as
you
say
the
word
firearm
must
be
taken
into
account
in
determining
the
meaning
of
the
word
carry
because
that's
part
of
its
context,
so
also
the
phrase,
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence
or
a
drug
offense
must
be
taken
into
account
in
gathering
the
meaning
of
carry,
because
that
is
part
of
its
context.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
now,
the
second
question
is,
are
there
any
other
statutes
that
have
similar
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can't
imagine
that
there's
none
that
says
it's
a
crime
to
transport
a
firearm
for
an
unlawful
purpose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--from
a
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
carry
it
for
a
lawful
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
or,
indeed,
even
if
it's
on
his
person,
so
long
as
he
hasn't
moved
it,
i
suppose.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
he
gets
one
of
his
confederates
to
come
and
hand
him
the
gun
and
he
puts
it--
--so
there
are
oddities
of
omission,
but
is
there
any
oddity
of...
is
there
any
oddity
that
is
produced...
if
we
accept
the
government's
interpretation,
does
that
produce
anything
odd?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
you
can
carry
a
grudge,
you
can
carry
a
tune,
you
can
carry
a
whole
lot
of
things
and
it
has
different
meanings,
depending
on--
[laughter]
--what
you're
carrying,
right?
that's
your
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
purse
would
clearly
qualify,
wouldn't
it?
if
a
woman
carried
a
gun
in
her
purse,
that
would
qualify?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
make
the
purse
a
little
bigger
and
it's
a
suitcase,
and
would
that
qualify?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
line
is
between
the
suitcase
and
the
wheelbarrow?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
examples
of
being
in
a
catamaran,
or
being
in
the
caboose
of
a
long
train?
is
it
still
being
carried?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
very
strange
for
congress
to
convey
those
two
quite
different
meanings.
number
1,
i'm
worried
about
somebody
carrying
a
gun
on
his
person,
so
that
even
if
he's
sitting
there
stock
still,
i
want
this
statute
to
cover
him,
but
i'm
also
worried
about
that
gun
in
the
caboose,
and--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
use
the
same
word
to
cover
both
of
those
things,
i
find
that
extraordinary.
justice
antonin
scalia
those
cases
just
make
the
point
more
vivid,
and
the
point
is,
it
seems
strange...
sure,
the
word
can
bear
each
of
those
meanings,
but
it
seems
strange
for
congress
to
pick
that
word
without
using
an
additional
word
to
cover
both
of
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you're
saying
that
when
we
say
using
a
firearm
included
displaying
it,
it
means
displaying
it
up
on
the
wall?
i
thought
it
meant,
you
know,
hands
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
you're
not
shooting
at
anybody,
but
you're
brandishing
the
firearm.
you
think
if
you
have
it
displayed
on
the
wall,
that...
you're
displaying
a
firearm,
you're
using
a
firearm.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
that's
displaying
it.
i
don't
think
that's
displaying
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
words
are
not
normally
used
in
those...
in
every
sense
that
they
can
have.
they're
usually
used
in
a...
you
know,
there's
some
line
by...
i
think
it's
an
ogden
nash
line.
he...
she
made
out
his
purpose
up
his
mind,
up
her
mind
and
a
dash
for
the
door.
i
mean,
you
know,
made
has
all
of
those
meanings.
she
made
out
his
purpose
up
her
mind
and
a
dash
for
the
door.
but
you
don't
use
words
with
all
three
meanings,
and
i
find
it
strange
to
think
that
congress
is
going
to
use
the
word
carry
with
those
two
quite
different
meanings.
justice
antonin
scalia
before
you
get
off
the
example
you
gave
about
these
other
statutes,
i
think
it
seems
to
me
that
the
petitioners
have
an
adequate
response
to
that,
and
that
is
that
when
you
talk
about
permissive
statutes
authorizing
federal
agents
to
carry
guns
you
can
apply
the
principle
that
the
authorization
of
the
greater
is
implicitly
an
authorization
of
the
lesser.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
if
you
author
them
to
carry
a
gun
in
the
sense
of
bear
it
on
their
person,
you
obviously
authorize
them
to
take
it
from
place
to
place
whether
it's
in
the
trunk
of
the
car
or
on
the
seat,
but
you
cannot
use
the
greater
includes
the
lesser
for
criminal
punishments.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
know,
it
seems
to
me
if
i'm
a
person
reading...
isn't
that
the
test?
if
i'm
a
person
reading
a
statute,
would
i
be
given
adequate
notice
that
that's
what
it's
about?
it's
a
statute
making
it
unlawful
to
carry
a
firearm,
and
you
think
i'm
put
on
adequate
notice
that
it's
if
i
have
it
in
the
trunk
of
my
car
i'm
carrying--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
care
about
state
statutes
or
anything
else.
you
could
have
dozens
of
them,
but
if
the
language
doesn't
give
fair
notice
to
whoever's
going
to
be...
going
to
get
this
mandatory
minimum--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
cover
this,
too,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
also
says,
or
with
knowledge
or
reasonable
cause
to
believe
that
an
offense
is
to
be
committed
therewith.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
carrying...
the
half
of
carrying
that
doesn't
consist
of
on
the
person,
is
that
always
transportation?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
tell
you
why
you
should
say
no.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
want
to
lead
you
into
the
hole.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
am
sort
of
bemused
by
section
925,
which
says
the
provisions
of
this
chapter,
except
for
a
few
sections
which
are
not
the
one
we're
talking
about
here,
shall
not
apply
with
respect
to
the
transportation,
shipment,
receipt,
possession,
or
importation
of
any
firearm
or
ammunition
imported
for,
sold,
or
shipped
to
or
issued
for
the
use
of
the
united
states
or
any
department
or
agency
thereof,
or
any
state.
now,
i
suppose
that
that...
you
know,
if
transportation
includes
carry,
i
guess
that
would
let
the...
or
if
carry
is
always
transportation,
the
carry
section
wouldn't
apply
if
you're
using
a...
i
don't
know,
a
gun
that's
been
taken
from
a
federal
agent,
which
wouldn't
make
much
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
your
answer
is
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
--guns
in
the
suitcase
on
the
train.
i
mean,
if
you
get
on
a
train,
you
chuck
your
suitcase
up
on
the
rack
or
in
the
back
of
the
car.
