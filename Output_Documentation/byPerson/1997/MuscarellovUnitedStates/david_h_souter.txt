do
any
of
those
other
provisions
speak
of
transport
in
relation
to
a
crime
of
violence,
or
a
drug
crime,
or
is
it
just
transport
in
the
abstract?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
that
to
read
it
as
the
government
would
read
it
i
think
probably
would
not,
therefore,
just
duplicate,
in
effect,
all
of
the
other
prohibitions
on
transportation,
correct?
justice
david
h.
souter
maybe
i'm
not
getting
my
point
across.
i
thought
the
reason
that
it
wouldn't
was
that
there's
a
limitation.
there's
a
restriction
here,
in
relation
to
a
drug
crime
or
crime
of
violence,
and
that
restriction
does
not
occur
in
the
instances
in
which
transportation
is
specifically
prohibited
in
other
parts
of
the
statute.
that's
the
only
point
that
i'm
trying
to--
justice
david
h.
souter
you
seem
to
be
taking
the
view
that
the
inrelationto
has
to
be
specific
to
the
transaction
as
it
finally
turned
out.
why
should
that
be?
why
can't
in
relation
to
simply
refer
to
the
general
subject
matter?
if
he
put
the
guns
in
the
trunk
for
whatever
use
they
would
turn
out
to
be
to
him
in
whatever
drug
transaction
he
succeeded
in
engaging
in,
why
isn't
that
enough
for
in
relation
to?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
say
anything
about
during.
i
said...
i
was
asking
you
why
it
is
not
sufficient
for
the
inrelationto
prong
to
prove
that
he
put
them
in
the
car
for
whatever
use
they
might
turn
out
to
be
in
whatever
drug
transaction
he
succeeded
in
engaging
in.
he
didn't
know,
on
my
hypothesis,
what
that
transaction
would
be
exactly,
but
he
did
know
that
he
intended
to
engage
in
a
drug
transaction.
why,
under
those
circumstances,
is
not
the
inrelationto
prong
satisfied?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
point
that
he
is
committing
and
that
he
has
taken
the
substantial
step
so
that
he
has
committed
the
crime
of
attempt
when
he
starts
loading
the
guns
in
the
car?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
don't
have
to
be
near
the
scene
of
the
consummated
crime
to
engage
in
an
attempt,
if
i
take
a
substantial
step
somewhere
else.
justice
david
h.
souter
you
haven't
taken
the
substantial
step
at
that
point?
