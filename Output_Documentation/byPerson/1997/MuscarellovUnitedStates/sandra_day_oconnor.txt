justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
the
person
with
the
gun
physically
had
it
in
his
hands
and
put
it
in
the
car
in
order
to
go
and
have
a
drug
transaction
and
in
order
to
have
a
weapon
available
to
facilitate
carrying
out
the
drug
transaction.
you
say
the
person
would
have
carried
the
gun
when
he
was
putting
it
in
the
car.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
mean,
carried
it
for
use
at
the
time
the
drug
sale
is
made,
for
example.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
can
he
be
charged
with
carrying
the
gun
because
he
carried
it
to
the
car,
where
he
then
put
it
where
it
was
not
immediately
available?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
days
gone
by
if
some
rider
had
a
gun
in
the
scabbard
on
his
saddle,
as
used
to
be
the
day
when
i
lived
on
a
ranch,
is
that
person
carrying
a
weapon?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right
there
on
the
saddle.
you
know
where
they
put
the
scabbard
on
a
saddle.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nor
would
it
be
if
you
had
it
in
a
wheelbarrow
and
were
moving
it
from
place
to
place.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
your
view
you
say
that
putting
it
in
a
wheelbarrow
and
pushing
it
isn't
carrying.
how
about
one
of
these
luggage
containers
that's
on
a
little
strap
and
wheels?
not
carrying,
i
guess,
huh?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's--
--well,
that's...
that's--
--the
language
of
the
statute?
at
924(c)
it
says
whoever
during
and--
--and.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
relation
to
any
crime
of
violence
or
drugtrafficking
crime
uses
or
carries
a
firearm.
they
have
to
go
together,
do
they,
during
and
in
relation
to?
it
has
to
be
both.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
most
dictionaries
seem
to...
which
i'm
sure
we've
all
been
looking
at
since
this
case
arose,
they
seem
to
say
two
different
things.
they
say
carry
means
to
convey
or
transport
as
in
a
cart
or
a
car,
and
also
they
say,
to
have
or
bear
about
one's
person,
as
a
watch
or
a
weapon,
locomotion
not
being
essential.
i
mean,
they
seem
to
have
both
concepts
in
there,
so
which
one
do
we
look
to,
and
do
you
think
movement
is
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
someone
with
a
gun
in
a
pocket
who's
sitting
in
a
chair
and
not
moving
is
covered
under
your
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
weapon
is
in
the
car,
in
the
government's
view
is
movement
required?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
car
stops,
so
the
drug
transaction
can
be
carried
out.
there's
no
movement
at
the
time,
during
the
drug
transaction.
the
car
is
parked.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
do
you
do
about
two
people
in
a
vehicle
in
the
government's
definition?
there's
a
driver
and
there's
a
passenger
and
there's
a
gun
in
the
glove
compartment.
who's
carrying
the
weapon?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
who
has
it,
in
the
government's
view,
driver,
passenger,
weapon
in
glove
compartment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
are
separate
offenses
for
transporting
firearms.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
transport
statutes
would
cover
what
happened
here,
do
you
think?
i
mean,
could
the
government
have
charged
either
of
these
petitioners
with
one
of
the
transportation
offenses?
