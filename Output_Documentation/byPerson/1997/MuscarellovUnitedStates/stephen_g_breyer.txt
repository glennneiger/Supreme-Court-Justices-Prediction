what
are
the
oddities?
that's...
i
mean,
i
carry
plants
in
the
back
of
my
car
in
the
trunk,
i
think,
haven't
i,
when
i
go
to
the
nursery,
pick
up
the
plants,
put
them
in
the
trunk,
carry
them
to
my
house.
i
always
thought
i
was
carrying
the
plants.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
i
really
want
to
know
is,
i'm
pointing
out
i
don't
find
that
odd.
i
do
find
it
odd,
as
you
do,
that
if
there
really
are
things
like
you
see
in
the
movies,
you
know,
big
gangsters
with
huge
guns
guarding
the
place,
that
that
wouldn't
fall
within
the
statute.
we
both
find
that
odd.
what
are
the
oddities
on
the
government's
interpretation?
you
said
that
was
odd,
and
i'm
not
certain...
i
want
to
know--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
want
you
to
focus
on
what
those
are.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
do...
why
when
i
put
the...
i
mean,
this
is
what...
because
i
so
often
use
the
words,
i
put
a
flower
plant
or
something
for
my
wife
in
the
trunk,
and
i
feel
i'm
carrying
that
to
my
house,
and
why,
in
the
plain
meaning
of
the
words,
if
instead
of
a...
i
hope
i
wouldn't
do
it...
instead
of
a
flower
plant,
it
happens
to
be
a
case
of
rifles
that
we're
using
to...
for
the
big
drug
transaction.
[laughter]
why
am
i
not
carrying
that?
i
mean,
if
i'm
carrying
the
plant,
why
wouldn't
i
be
carrying
the
case
of
rifles?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i'm...
my
problem,
to
be
specific,
and
i'm
trying
to
get
an
answer
to
this,
is
whenever
i
would
think
of
an
anomaly,
and
i've
been
trying
to
think
of
them,
is
it
seems
to
me
the
anomalies
tend
to
be
taken
care
of
on
the
government's
interpretation
by
the
words,
in
relation
to
a
drug
transaction,
so
i
really
haven't,
once
i
play
with
those
words,
found
anything
odd
about
the
government's
interpretation,
and
that's
why
i'm
asking
you
to
tell
me
if
i...
if
i
adopt
the
government's
interpretation
and
work
with
those
words,
in
relation
to,
does
it
produce
any
odd
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suppose
you
define
carry
as
transport
but
omit
the
meaning
of
transport
that
means
ship.
in
other
words,
transport
some...
it's
transport,
but
not
arrange
for
transport.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
two
things
i
don't
see
about
your
definition.
the
first
thing
i
don't
see...
these
may
or
may
not
be
relevant,
but
i
don't
see
why
you
say
the
train,
why
he's
carrying
it
in
the
train,
unless
he
happens
to
be
sidney...
who
was
the
person,
averell
harriman
or
someone,
who
owned
the
train
and
was
also
the
engineer
at
the
time.
then
i
guess
he's
carrying
it,
but
otherwise
i
would
think
he's
arranging
to
have
it
carried.
i
don't
understand
that
part,
and
i
also
don't
understand
this
last
part
where
you
say
having
it
on
the
person
is
carry
within
this,
because
i
would
have
thought
on
your
theory
that's
what
kozinski
was
talking
about,
packing
a
gun.
that
is,
i
thought
that
the
second
definition
in
there,
in
the
dictionary,
was
referring
to
the
instance
where
there
is
no
physical
movement
but
you
say,
are
you
carrying
a
gun,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
even
if
the
person
has
never
moved
an
inch,
because
sometimes
carry
means
packing,
and
i
don't
see
why
you
bring
either
of
those
two
things
within
your
definition.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
they
put
use.
that's
why
use
is
there.
i
mean,
certainly
it's
an
odd...
i
mean,
it's
in
the
dictionary.
you
go
ahead,
because
i
want
your
answer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
isn't
really
no.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
your
answer
wasn't
really
no,
was
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
then
i
am
confused.
you
mean
that
carry
is
not...
does
not
include
trans--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
thought
carrying,
at
its
heart,
from
middle
english
on,
was
having
somebody
in
a
cart,
or
a
car,
and
we
often
use
the
word
transportation
for
that.
