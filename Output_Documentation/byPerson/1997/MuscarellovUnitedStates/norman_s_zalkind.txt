mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court--
in
deciding
bailey,
you
have
given
those
of
us
who
labor
in
the
fields
of
criminal
law
a
clear
line
definition,
and
we're
asking
for
the
same
with
the
word
carry.
we're
asking
for
really
the
ordinary
and
plain
meaning
of
the
word
carry
in
context
of
firearms,
and
of
all
the
cases
that
i've
read
i
haven't
heard
about
rocket
launchers
used
in
drug
transactions
in
any
of
the
circuit
cases.
we're
really
talking
about
firearms,
portable
firearms,
and
that's
bearing
on
the
person.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
if
it's
right
on
his--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--i
understand
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
would
say,
under
our
definition,
that
that
would
not
be
carried,
because
it's
not
on--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--no,
that
would
not
be
carried.
if
you
had...
and
if
you
had
a
locked
briefcase,
and
in
the
locked
briefcase
there
was
cocaine
and
there
was
a
mack
20,
one
of
these
fierce
firearms
that
was
mentioned
in
smith,
that
would
be
carried.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
because
we're
talking
about
statutory
interpretation
and
we're--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--talking
about
a
narrow
meaning
of
the
word
carry,
which
is
bear
on
the
person,
and
we're--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--justice
scalia,
i
totally
agree
with
you.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
yes,
because
the
government's...
justice
breyer,
the
government's
interpretation
is
basically
a
transportation
interpretation,
and
you're
talking
about
the
trunk
of
a
vehicle.
what
about
the
ocean
liner?
what
about
the
double
truck,
where
you
have
the
double
caboose?
what
about
the
caboose
at
the
end
of
the
railroad
line?
what
about
the
power
boat
that
is
20
feet,
and
then
it's
40
feet,
and
then
it's
75
feet?
what
about
the...
i
sail
on
racing
boats.
what
about
the
50-foot
racing
boat,
and
it's
a
trimaran,
and
you're
out
on
the
furthest
end
of
the
trimaran,
and
that's
where
you
could
carry
firearms.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
that's
becoming
closer,
your
honor,
because
we're
talking
about
on
the
person,
and
once
you
have
that
luggage
that
you're
carrying
right
with
you,
that's
not
really
a
separate...
that's
right
on
the...
that's
very
on
the
person.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
justice
scalia,
that
would
qualify.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
if
the
person
is
carrying
that
suitcase?
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
justice
scalia,
that
would
qualify,
but
if
the
wheelbarrow...
we
would
say
there's
a
line
draw...
that's
a--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--no,
between
the
body.
[laughter]
between
the
body.
we
would
include,
for
instance,
if
you
had
10
layers
of
clothes,
and
there
would
be
a
firearm
that
you...
that
was
in...
under
the
10
layers,
that
would
be
carried,
even
though
you
would
not
have
immediate
access.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
chief
justice,
that's
correct,
but
the
version
that
we're
suggesting
is
the
easiest
and
it
has
the
easiest
line
to
draw.
congress,
if
they
want
to
make
possession
a
crime,
then
they...
and
they're
trying
to
right
now.
they
can
add
the
word
possession
if
they
want
to,
or
they
can
add
the
word
transport,
but
the
line
that
we're
drawing
is
the
easiest,
and
you
did
it
for
us
in
bailey.
we
know--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--justice
ginsburg,
i
most
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
because
he
did
carry
some
firearms
to
the
car,
but
it
wasn't
in
relation
to
a
drug
crime
at
that
time.
it
hadn't...
he...
that
issue
was
never
raised.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
not
in
my
case.
i...
if
a
drug
connection
was
really
evolving,
it...
let's
say
the
drug
transaction
started
down
in
symphony
hall,
and
he
had
some
guns
hidden
in
a
building
near
symphony
hall,
and
once
he
made
the
conversation
with
the
drug
dealers
they
really
knew
they
were
going
to
a
motel,
and
he
went
over
to
a
building,
grabbed
his
guns,
and
brought
them
and
threw
them
in
the
trunk
at
that...
while
the
drug
transaction
was
moving,
that
would
be
different.
but
in
my
case,
sometime
earl...
much
earlier
in
the
afternoon,
when
he
didn't
know
that
where
there
was
going
to
be
a
meeting,
what
the
quantity
was
of...
what
the
negotiations
were,
was
he
going
to
get
the
drugs
fronted
or
was
he
going
to
rip
the
drugs
off,
there
was
no
specific
plan,
he
was
charged
with
an
attempt
to
commit
possession
with
intent
to
distribute
cocaine.
he
wasn't...
the
other
charges
were
dismissed.
that's
the
charge
that
he
made
a
conditional
plea
to,
so
in
our
case
he
would
be
not
guilty.
there
are
cases
that
if
it's
all
within
an
immediate
activity,
during
the
drug
transaction,
yes,
i
would
agree
with
you,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
it
isn't
because
there's
no...
he
could
have
been
arrested
at
the...
when
he
carried
the
guns
to
the
car
and
charged
with
the
specific
crime
of
attempting
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute
cocaine
at
that
time.
he
could
have
been
arrested
by
the
state
of
massachusetts
for
possession
of
firearms,
but
he
couldn't
have
been
arrested
for
during
a
drug
crime,
because
the
drug
crime
wasn't--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--well,
every
single
drug
transaction
where
there
are
firearms
at
some
point,
and
i
think
it
was
mentioned
by
one
of
the
justices
before,
somebody
would
be
bringing
the
guns
to
the
car,
and
they're
just
not
committing
a
crime
at
that
time.
just
because--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--in
relation--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--justice
o'connor,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
during
and
in
relation--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--justice
souter,
not
if
he
doesn't
place
them
at
or
near
the
scene
of
the
crime.
when
he
placed
the
firearms
in
the
car,
that
was
not...
that
would
not
be
considered--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--most
respectfully,
we
would
disagree
with
you,
justice
souter.
you
would
have
to
take
a...
the
substantial
step
would
be
if
the
instruments
of
the
crime
were
placed
there
at
or
near
the
scene
of
the
crime
that
he's
attempting.
if
you
get
burglarious
instruments
and
you
don't
go
to
the
place,
you
just
have,
you
know,
hammers
and
tongs,
you're
not
going
to
be
committing
that
crime.
if
you
decide
in
your
mind
you're
going
to
murder
someone
and
you
get
the
firearm
and
you
put
it
in
your
car
and
you're
going
to
go
looking
for
this
person,
at
that
point
you're
not
committing
an
attempted
murder.
it's
only
when--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--you
have
not.
even
though
you...
but
you
are
guilty
of
the
possession
of
the
firearm,
but
that's
a
separate...
that's
a
state
statute,
or
it
could
be
a
federal
statute,
but
it's
not
this
case,
924(c),
or
i
gave...
given
hypotheticals
relating
to
other
kinds
of
crimes.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
justice
kennedy,
i
would...
if
i
understand
the
word
temporal,
because
i
don't
want
to
say
something
that
i
don't
totally
understand,
but
as
i
understand
what
you're
saying
i
would
agree
with
you
that
it's
an
active...
it's
an
active
word,
and
it
does...
we
would
prevail
under
that
definition,
as
we
would
prevail
under
immediate
accessibility,
but
we
think
immediate
accessibility
is
another
transport
excuse.
to
carry,
you
don't
have
to
move
the
firearm.
you
can
carry
a
firearm
by
just
having
it
inside
your
pocket.
as
the
examples
were
made
both
in...
both
in
bailey
and
smith
as
to
what
carry
would
be,
and
although
that's
not
totally
instructive
to
us,
it
is
saying
something.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
agree.
if
you
have
the
money
in
your
pocket
you
are
carrying
money.
if
you
have
even
an
unloaded
firearm
in
your
pocket,
you
are
carrying
a
firearm,
and
the...
what
the
transport
theory
does
is,
it
might
convict
someone
that
has
an
unloaded
derringer
in
the
trunk,
but
it
won't
convict
the
big
drug
dealer
that
has
an
automatic
machine
gun
in
the
next
room
that's
sitting
there,
so...
i
mean,
not
that
that
has...
we
have
to
draw
a
line
somewhere,
but
i
just
want
to
point
out
our
thinking
about
this.
again,
there's
no
linguistic
reason
to
define
carry
as
an
auto...
as
transporting,
and
pure
transport
has
enormous
problems,
as
i
think
we've
pointed
out
to
you.
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
well,
justice
breyer,
then
you...
you're
adding
to
the
interpretive
problems
even
further.
you're
getting
into
ambiguity
with
that,
and
if
you're
getting
into
ambiguity
we
start
to
think
about
the
rule
of
lenity,
because
we're
talking
about
very
serious
crimes.
in
the
cleveland
and
gray
case,
they
got
10
years
to
begin
with.
forget
about
the
firearm.
they
start
off
with
10
years
of
their
lives,
and
now
we
have
this
enormous
minimum
mandatory
5
years
that's
going
to
be
added,
and
if
they're
not
convicted
of
that
the
judge
could
have...
in
that
case
he
could
have
used
the
guidelines,
bump
it
up
two
more
levels
anyway.
so
it
isn't
that
the
trial
judges
don't
have
power
to
penalize
bad
behavior,
but
we're
talking
about
carrying
firearms,
a
sort
of
narrow
class
of
separate
minimum
mandatory
crimes
for
people
that
are
being
severely
punished,
so--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--justice
ginsburg,
no,
we
don't
accept
that
line,
although
if
you
accept
that
line,
then
we
would
prevail.
but
again,
that's
another
transport
exception,
because
there
is
that
movement
that
justice
kozinski
eloquently
states
in
his
en
banc
decision,
and
we're
saying
that
no,
that
that
would
not
be
carry.
that
would
be
the
line
that's
drawn,
would
be
at
that
point.
even
though
it
was
within
immediate
access,
that
would
not
be
carry,
and
i
think
that's
consistent
with
the
bailey
decision.
and
again,
once
those
lines
are
drawn--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--justice
ginsburg,
if
there
was,
for
instance,
somebody
in
the
back
seat,
and
that
person
ended
up
cooperating
with
the
government
and
said,
look,
we're
driving
along
in
the
car
and
he
sees
the
police
and
he
flips
the
gun
beside
him,
he's
be...
he'd
be
guilty
of
carrying,
because
his
is
during,
in
relation
to
a
drug
crime.
but
if
it
just
so
happens
he
puts
the
gun
on
the
seat,
he
might
be
guilty
of
use,
because
if
somebody
comes
over
and
they
see
that
gun
and
says,
now--
mr.
norman
s.
zalkind
--thank
you.
