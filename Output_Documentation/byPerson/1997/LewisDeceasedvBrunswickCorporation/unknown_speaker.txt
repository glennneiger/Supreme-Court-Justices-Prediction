unknown
speaker
mr.
hudson,
we
have
a
good
amplifying
system.
i
think
we
could
hear
you
even
if
you
didn't
speak
quite
as
loud.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
we've
certainly
held
in
medtronic
and
in
that
cipollone
case
that
state
common
law
actions
can
constitute
requirements
subject
to
preemption.
unknown
speaker
can
lead
to?
it
is.
i
mean,
they
are
requirements,
and
i
don't
see
why
we
should
necessarily
create...
treat
this
statute
differently
in
that
regard.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
isn't
the
whole
purpose
of
your
punitive
damage
claim
to
require
the
manufacturer
to
change
his
behavior?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
what
you're
going
to
argue
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
that
the
main
thrust
of
your
argument
below
is
that
the
propeller
guard
should
have
been
installed.
you're
going
to
change
the
behavior
of
the
manufacturer.
that's
the
whole
justification,
at
least
for
your
punitive
damage
award,
punitive
damage
claim.
unknown
speaker
on
that
very
point,
if...
imagine
that
the
coast
guard
here
had
said
what
it
didn't
say,
but
suppose
it
said
we
think
that
the
guards
on
these
propellers
are
actually
a
greater
danger
than
an
unguarded
propeller
because
somebody
can
get
hit
on
the
head,
and
that's
a
bigger
chance
of
harm
than
the
other,
so
suppose
because
of
that
they'd
said
very
clearly,
we
don't
want
guards.
now,
on
your
view
of
the
statute
a
jury
would
be
perfectly
free
to
award
punitive
damages
against
the
manufacturer
because
he
did
the
very
thing
that
the
coast
guard
told
him
to
do.
now,
what
sense
would
that
make
of
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
so
how
do
you
prevent...
how
do
you
read
it
your
way,
which
is
to
say,
it
preserves
common
law
claims,
and
yet
avoid
what
you've
just
said
is
a
ridiculous
result?
unknown
speaker
what
happens
to
your
savings
clause
here?
you
said
that
the
savings
clause
preserves
all
common
law
remedies
and
so
why
hasn't
congress,
on
your
view
of
it...
i
mean,
what
then
does
the
savings
clause
mean?
you
started
off
pointing
to
that
savings
clause
which
refers
to
common
law
and
state
law--
unknown
speaker
--and...
yes.
so
you
see
my
question.
unknown
speaker
well--
--you
mean,
it
reads
punitive
damages
out?
unknown
speaker
i'm
trying
to
get
your
view
on
it.
i
thought
your
view
was
that
the
common
law
was
simply
preserved.
now
i
take
it
your
view
is
that
the
common
law
is
simply
preserved
in
the
absence
of
a
specific
determination
by
the
coast
guard.
is
that
your
view?
that's
a
different
view.
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words
your
view
is
that
the
savings
clause
does
nothing
if
the
coast
guard...
it...
the
savings
clause
is
necessary,
i
guess,
in
your
view.
it's
just
that
this
prempt...
a
straight
rule
of
the
coast
guard
preempts
the
tort
remedy,
but
other
than
a
straight
rule
it
doesn't,
is
that
the
view?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
simply--
--well,
but
you
told
me
that
state
common
law
couldn't
be
a
requirement
and
could
never
have
any
preemptive
effect,
so
you
can't
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
take
it
you're
backing
off
that
position
and
you're
saying,
well,
if
it
really
is
in
direct
conflict,
then
maybe
common
law
rules
can
in
fact
be
requirements
or
regulations
under--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
even
if--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
we
think
that,
that
doesn't
end
the
case
for
you
because
you
have
another
theory
here,
right?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
before
you
get
to...
i
thought
that
your
position
was
that
the
savings
clause
requires
us
to
read
the
statute
in
such
a
way
that
the
reference
to
regulations
or
standards
does
not
necessarily
encompass
every
common
law
rule.
do
you
go
any
further
than
that?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
and
what
do
you
do
with
the
phrase,
or
under
state
law?
i
didn't
understand
your--
unknown
speaker
--you
just
say
you
have
to
read
it
with
the
word--
unknown
speaker
--liability.
i
don't...
that
doesn't
make
any
sense
to
me.
i
don't--
unknown
speaker
--well,
you
could
call
it
a
state
law...
it's
positive
state
enactment
rather
than
common
law...
couldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
that
reference
to
state
law
might
be
an
indication
that
the
only...
that
the
general
preemption
clause
should
be
read
to
mean
that
there
is
no
preemption
unless
there
is
a
positive
enactment
of
federal
law.
that
might
be
one
indication
of...
and
that's
not
the
way
the
coast
guard
read
it
right
after
the
act,
after
the
passage
of
act,
but
it
could
mean
that
too,
couldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
read
it
either
way.
i
mean,
there's
an
ambiguity
there.
i
suppose
you
could
read
it
as
saying,
all
state
law
goes
unless
the
coast
guard
has
adopted
a
regulation
and
state
law
is
identical
to
that
regulation,
or
you
could
read
it
as
saying,
all
state
law
stays
unless
there
is
a
coast
guard
regulation
and
in
that
case
the
only
state
law
that
stays
is
that
which
is
identical.
you
could
read
it
either
way,
i
suppose,
textually.
the
reference
to
state
law
in
the
savings
clause
as
distinct
from
common
law
might
be
an
indication
of
which
of
those
two
possible
readings
you
should
take,
i.e.
that
the
state
law
is
preserved
in
the
absence
of
a
positive
enactment
with
conflict.
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
unknown
speaker
if
that's
what
we
mean.
you
don't...
we
don't
have
to
resolve
that
question,
i
take
it,
to
decide
in
your
favor,
because
the
government
is
taking
the
position,
i
assume,
that
the
coast
guard
is
right
when
the
coast
guard
says,
we're
the
only
ones
in
the
standard-setting
business,
so
to
reach
your
common
law
claim
we
don't
have
to
decide--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
about
the...
whether
the
georgia...
the
question
of
georgia
law
of...
to
introduce
to
this
jury
the
fact
that
the
coast
guard
did
not
make
a
regulation
requiring
propeller
guards
would
be
relevant,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
and
the
fact
that
the
coast
guard
that
has
set
other
standards
didn't
set
this
one.
unknown
speaker
mr.
hudson--
--are
you
responding
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
by
saying
what
you
think
is
desirable,
or
what
you
feel
you
know
about
the
georgia
law
of
evidence?
unknown
speaker
mr.
hudson,
4305
is
discussed
in
all
the
briefs.
i
can't
find
it
set
forth
anywhere.
is
it
set
forth
in
any
of
your
submissions?
it's
very
annoying
to
have
a
lot
of
discussion
going
on
about
a
particular
statutory
provision
and
you
look
in
the
materials
in
front
of
you
and
it's
just
not
there.
is
it
in
the
red
brief?
unknown
speaker
it's
the
one
that
permits
the
state
to
apply--
unknown
speaker
--for
an
exemption.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
still
looking
for
it.
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
hudson.
mr.
frederick,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
what
about
punitives?
we've
heard
that
argument
before.
we
heard
it
in
cipollone.
we
hear
it
in
every
case
where
the
issue
is
whether
common
law
remedies
are
precluded,
and
we
have
not
found
it
persuasive.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
it's
true,
you
can
roll
the
dice
if
you
like.
i
suppose
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
an
explicit
regulatory
prohibition
and
there's
especially
very
little
difference
when
you
have
punitive
damages.
i
mean,
i
could
ignore
a
regulation,
too,
can't
i,
and
say
it's
a
cost
of
business.
a
cost
of
doing
business
is
now
and
then
i'll
get
picked
up
for
violating
the
regulation.
it's
worth
it.
i
can
say
that
about
a
regulation
just
as
well
as
about
a
common
law
liability.
unknown
speaker
is
that
true
even
if
the
coast
guard
has
a
particular
rule?
i
mean,
suppose
the
coast
guard
said,
look,
this
is
obviously
a
tough
question
whether
you
should
have
propeller
guards
or
not.
people
are
killed
both
ways,
and
if
the...
you
don't
want
to
make
a
mistake.
so
the
coast
guard
says,
we
don't
want
it.
we
think
more
people
are
killed
with
the
propeller
guards
than
without.
are
you
saying
under
those
circumstances
in
your
view
a
state
is
perfectly
free
to
award
$50,
$60,
$100
million
in
punitive
damages
for
doing
the
very
thing
the
coast
guard
said
not
to
do?
unknown
speaker
ah.
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words
it's
just
the
fact
they
don't
have
a
particular
reg
here
that
this
turns
on,
in
your
opinion.
unknown
speaker
so
if
they
have
a
reg...
suppose
they
do
have
a
reg.
unknown
speaker
in
your
view,
should
we
look
to
see
whether
that
reg,
there's
a
direct
conflict
with
the
state
law
or
common
law
state...
you
know,
the
tort
judgment,
whether
it...
the
state
tort
judgment
would
defeat
an
object
of
the
reg,
or
whether
the
state
judgment
would
be
in
an
area
that
the
reg
clearly
intends
to
reserve
to
the
coast
guard...
that's
your
view
of
it?
unknown
speaker
okay.
if
that's
your
view
of
it,
why
doesn't
that
apply...
and
i
think
maybe
that
is
a
perfectly
good
view.
why
doesn't
that
just
as
much
apply
to
a
state
positive
regulation
as
it
would
to
a
tort
action?
unknown
speaker
the
trouble
i
find
with
this
analysis,
that
you
rely
just
on
implied
preemption
for
common
law,
is
that
would
be
very
peculiar
in
a
statute
which
in
4306
insists
that
the
state
law
be
identical,
that
the
state
regulation,
at
least,
be
identical
to
the
federal
law.
i
mean,
it's
really
saying,
we
don't
want
any
state
regulation
unless
it's
the
very
same
one.
unknown
speaker
why
would
a
state
want
to
have
a
regulation
that
was
identical
with
the
federal
regulation?
unknown
speaker
the
states
couldn't
help
enforce
the
coast
guard
regulation?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
the
american
law
institute
always
represents
what
is
the
view
in
almost
all
of
the
states?
that
hasn't
been
my
experience.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
think
there
would
be
real
reason
to
put
that
in
just
in
case
a
number
of
states
were
following
it.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
do--
--what
do
you
do
with...
oh.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
frederick.
when
we
return
at
1:00,
mr.
geller,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
excuse
me.
i
didn't
know
that
the
coast
guard
had
found
that
at
all.
the
solicitor
general's
brief
sets
out
a
portion
of
the
coast
guard's
letter
stating
the
reason
that
it
was
going
to
take
no
actions.
this
is
on
page
7
of
the
sg's
brief.
at
least
in
the
excerpt
there
the
coast
guard
didn't
make
any
such
finding.
is
there
more
material?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
right,
but
the
coast
guard--
unknown
speaker
--gave
its
reasons.
i
mean,
it
said
there
was
a
deficiency
of
accident
data,
the
difficulty
of
coming
up
with
a
single
model,
and
so
on.
it
didn't,
as
i
understand
it,
adopt
any
finding
that
in
fact
it
would
be
more
dangerous
in
some
cases--
unknown
speaker
--so
i
don't
think
we
can
attribute
that
to
the
coast
guard.
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
had
been
no
federal
statute
at
all?
a
boat
manufacturer
would
still
have
a
difficult
time
complying
with
both--
unknown
speaker
--south
carolina
and
georgia
law
were
they
different.
unknown
speaker
well,
yes,
but
the
coast
guard
did
not,
in
fact,
adopt
a
regulation
on
this
specific
device,
and
i
don't
know
that
south
carolina
have
a
different
rule.
does
south
carolina
have
common
law
principles
that
say
you
must
have
a
propeller
guard?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
it
clearly
envisions
that
the
coast
guard
might
not
take
action
with
regard
to
the
whole
universe
of
possible
actions
it
could
take,
and
we
have
a
situation
here
where
it
didn't
take
action.
unknown
speaker
and
that
may
leave
open
some
room
for
application
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
of
course,
that
included,
as
i
understand
it,
state
regulatory
requirements
in
the
narrow
sense,
so
that
it
did
not
necessarily
imply
that
the
coast
guard
thought
that
it
was
necessary
to
do
that
to
preserve
any
state
common
law.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
that's...
i
mean,
my
only
point
is,
i
don't
think
you
can
infer
from
that
that
the
coast
guard
ever
took
the
position
that
a
common
law
requirement
was,
in
fact,
preempted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
doesn't
it...
it's
a
little
unrealistic
to
talk
about
a
requirement
imposed
by
state
law
anyway.
it's
not
as
though...
i
mean,
even
within
the
state
of
south
carolina
a
manufacturer
wouldn't
know
whether
to
put
on
or
off
the
propeller
guard,
because
one
jury,
the
first
jury
may
find
it
was
negligent
not
to
have
it,
and
that...
certainly
that
finding
that
it
was
negligent
not
to
have
a
propeller
guard
does
not
prevent
a
subsequent
south
carolina
juror,
jury
from
finding
that
it
was
negligent
to
have
a
propeller
guard,
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
the
argument
for
exception
oddly
enough
supported
by
the
advisory
committee's
report
here,
and
that
is
that
the
designs
of
boats
vary
so
enormously
that
it
would
be
difficult,
if
not
impossible,
to
have
a
uniform
rule
in
the
sense
of
saying,
all
boats
should
have
propeller
guards,
or
all
boats
should
have
this
kind
of
propeller
guard.
the
kind
of
multifarious
context
here
suggests
exactly
what
common
law
adjudication
is
intended
to
serve,
and
that
is
quite
fact-specific
adjudications
when
no
uniform
rule
really
could
sensibly
be
written
to
cover
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
they...
and
you
know
this
better
than
i
do.
i
thought
they
said
that
in
some
cases
the
guard
would
in
fact
make
it
much
more
dangerous
than
it
was.
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
all
cases.
unknown
speaker
but
we
have
emphasized
the
language
in
the
particular
statutes.
unknown
speaker
does
it
have
the
word
requirement
in
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
as
you
do
that--
unknown
speaker
--can
you
tell
me
if
there's
another
statute
that
uses
the
word,
minimum
safety
standards,
because
i
thought
that
gave
some
kind
of
a
tone
to
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
everyone
agrees
that
there's
a
preemption
pro
tanto.
that
is,
to
the
extent
the
coast
guard
has
a
standard,
the
state
can't
have
a
different
one.
unknown
speaker
but
the
word
minimum
suggests
to
me
that
there
could
be
other
things,
that
every--
unknown
speaker
--that
those
standards
must
be
followed,
but
there
could
be
additional
standards.
unknown
speaker
the
reason
could
be
that
these
standards
are
in
place,
but
we're
not
saying
that
that's
the
universe,
that
there
can't
be
liability
apart
from
these
standards.
let
me
ask
you
something
just
as
a
matter
of
updating.
as
i
understood
the
propeller
guard,
it
wasn't
dead,
that
there's
still
current
consideration
in
the
coast
guard?
unknown
speaker
where...
what
is
the
status
of
that
now?
unknown
speaker
and
that's
just--
unknown
speaker
--all
we
know
is
that
they
asked
again.
unknown
speaker
and
we
don't
know
anything
about
the
answers.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
take--
--a
law
or
regulation
establishing--
unknown
speaker
--a
law
or
regulation
establishing--
unknown
speaker
--the
requirement?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
take
the
position,
mr.
geller,
that
regardless
of
whether...
what
we
think
of
the
action
or
inaction
of
the
coast
guard
on
this
propeller
guard
business
that
any
common
law
requirement
for
a
propeller
guard
by
a
state
is
preempted,
no
matter
what
the
coast
guard
has
done--
unknown
speaker
--or
hasn't
done.
unknown
speaker
so
if
the
coast
guard
had
never
even
studied
the
problem,
nothing
had
been
done--
unknown
speaker
--you
take
the
position
it's
still
preempted.
unknown
speaker
what
sense
would
that
make?
i
mean,
you
bring
me
along
a
lot
when
you
say,
unless
we
read
the
word
requirement
to
include
tort
action--
unknown
speaker
--then
you
would
have
a
coast
guard
explicit
rule
and
a
state
could
have
a
tort
case
that
would
force
the
opposite.
that
would
make
no
sense.
i
accept
that--
unknown
speaker
--at
least
for
argument.
but
doesn't
it
also
make
no
sense
to
say,
if
the
coast
guard
doesn't
do
anything,
does
nothing
whatsoever,
that
then
you
couldn't
have
any
state
tort
law
in
the
area?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
can
understand
why
congress
might
have
said,
if
the
coast
guard
does
nothing
at
all,
still
the
states
aren't
supposed
to
sit
there
and
write
rules
out
on
a
piece
of
paper,
but
i
just
can't
understand
why
congress
would
have
said,
if
the
congress
does
nothing
at
all,
all
of
state
tort
law
goes
up
in
smoke.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
but
why
would
congress
have
wanted
to--
unknown
speaker
--say
that
no
state
tort
law
for
the
basic
hornbook
classic
negligence--
unknown
speaker
--of
design,
any
of
that
stuff
when
the
coast
guard
does
nothing.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it...
i
take
it
that
an
additional
answer
to
justice
breyer...
maybe
you
don't
want...
is
that
this
didn't
prempt
all
state
tort
law
automatically
because
the
coast
guard
could
and,
in
fact,
did
leave
much
of
it
in
place,
and
in
the
states.
unknown
speaker
under
430...
05.
unknown
speaker
are
we
talking
about
4306
or
4305?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you
also
have
the
savings
clause,
4311,
and--
unknown
speaker
--its
reference
to
common
law
and
state
law
cuts
the
other
way,
i--
unknown
speaker
--what
does
it
apply
to?
give
me
a
few
examples.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
by
the
same
token
you
don't
need
a
savings
clause.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that
would
be
a
bizarre
reading
of
the
preemption
clause.
i
don't
think
you
really
need
it
for
that.
do
you
have
any
other
examples?
unknown
speaker
you're
talking
to
me?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
would
happen
in
a
case
that...
let's
assume
that
there
is
fairly
clear
preemption.
the
coast
guard
says,
no
propeller
guards,
and
this
boat
has
no
propeller
guards,
and
the
accident
happened.
could
the
plaintiff
sue
for
failure
to
warn?
unknown
speaker
about
the
absence,
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
looked
at
the
complaint
briefly.
i
didn't
see
a
failure
to
warn--
unknown
speaker
--allegation
here.
unknown
speaker
oh,
no.
it
would
just...
it
would
make
them
warn.
it
would
make
them
put
labels
on.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
geller,
it's...
you
say
that
a
propeller
is
regarded
as
associated
equipment
for
the
board--
unknown
speaker
--for
the
boat?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
a
part
of
the
boat
itself.
unknown
speaker
so
there's
a
little
bit
different
language
about
associated
equipment
than
there
is
for
the
vessel
itself,
isn't
there?
one
says,
imposing
a
requirement
for
associated
equipment,
and
for
the
boat
it
says,
enforce
a
law
or
regulation
establishing
performance
or
other
safety
standard.
unknown
speaker
a
requirement.
unknown
speaker
mr.
geller,
can
i
come
back
and
ask
you
for
another
example
of
how
the
savings
clause
would
apply
state
law,
other
than
a
state
law
that
had
been
exempted
under
4305?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
need
many.
just
give
me
a
couple.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
unless
the
defective
manufacture
claim
dealt
with
the
manufacture
of
the
propeller--
unknown
speaker
--it
seems
to
me
it
would
be
preempted
anyway.
i
just
don't
see
any
realistic
situation
in
which
the
savings
clause
would
apply,
other
than
when
there's
been
an
exemption,
which
i
don't
find--
unknown
speaker
--terribly
persuasive.
unknown
speaker
mr....
finish
your
answer.
i'm
sorry.
unknown
speaker
i
want
to
be
sure...
i
thought
you
made
an
acknowledgement
of
a
point
i
didn't
think
you
would
make.
you
suggested
in
answer
to
justice
scalia
that
there
could
be
a
state
law
defective
manufacture
claim
even
if
the
coast
guard
had
promulgated
elaborate
regulations
about
how
boats
had
to
be
manufactured
and
the
boat
complied
with
every
one
of
those
regulations.
unknown
speaker
there
could
still
be
a
state
law
claim?
unknown
speaker
no,
i'm
assuming
it
complied
with
the...
because
it
only
talks
about
when
they
comply
with
all
the
federal
requirements.
you
think
there
still
could
be
a--
unknown
speaker
--no,
but
i'm
assuming
they...
of
course,
they
could
have
a
problem
here,
of
course.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
even
if--
unknown
speaker
--assuming
that
the
coast
guard
regulation
didn't
tell
you
how
many
bolts
to
put
on.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
there's
a
bigger
gap
in
this
case
than
the
one
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
if
that's
true
in
regard
to
a
minor
matter
like
nuts
and
bolts,
why
isn't
it
true
with
regard
to
the
total
omission
of
any
requirement
for
propeller
guards?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's
the
same...
true
with
the
four
bolts
instead
of
two.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
the
omission
is,
there's
no
requirement
on
the
number
of
bolts.
in
this
case,
there's
no
requirement
on
propeller
guards.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
says
performance
standard.
it
doesn't
talk
about
design.
unknown
speaker
so
therefore,
if
the
failure
to
have...
it's
the
same
question.
if
the
failure
to
have
a
performance
standard
permits,
in
your
view,
a
tort
suit
in
respect
to
the
defective
manufacture,
why
doesn't
the
failure
to
have
a
propeller
guard
standard
permit
a
tort
suit
in
respect
to
the
failure
to
have
the
propeller
guard?
i
think
that's
what
justice
stevens'--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
geller,
do
we
give
any
credence
to
the
fact
that
the
coast
guard
itself
doesn't
think
that
this
is
contrary
to
what
it's
intending
to
do.
in
fact,
it
thinks
it's
consistent
with
the
act.
unknown
speaker
the
coast
guard
isn't
in
charge
of
preemption
anyway.
the
coast
guard
doesn't
administer
preemption.
i
mean,
we
give
the
coast
guard
deference
on
those
matters
that
are
within
its
bailiwick.
unknown
speaker
whether
the
state
is
preempted
or
not
is
not
within
the
coast
guard's
bailiwick.
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
we
should
just
leave
the
coast
guard
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
some
inquiry
into
that
subject
is
within
their
purview,
because
they
can
pronounce
regulations
exempting--
unknown
speaker
--certain
state
laws.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
geller.
mr.
hudson,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
this
is
the
statement
of
the
commandant
before
this
legislation
was
on
the
books?
unknown
speaker
you
consider
that
to
be
a
position
of
the
agency
as
to
the
meaning
of
the
law?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
necessarily
have
a
conflict
if
they
added
something
that
the
regulations
didn't
have,
like
a
propeller
guard.
it
wouldn't
necessarily
conflict
any
more
than
it
does.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
