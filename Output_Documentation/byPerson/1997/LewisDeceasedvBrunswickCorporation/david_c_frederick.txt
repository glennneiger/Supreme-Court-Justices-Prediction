mr.
david
c.
frederick
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
scalia,
it's
at
page
2
of
the
red
brief.
actually,
sorry,
page
1
of
the
red
brief,
4305.
we
agree
with
petitioners
that
common
law
claims
are
not
expressly
preempted
or
impliedly
preempted
by
coast
guard
regulations
that
don't
exist
in
this
case.
congress
had
two
very
good
reasons
to
differentiate
between
positive
law
enactments
and
common
law
remedies
that
might
be
available.
the
first
is
that
common
law
remedies
give
manufacturers
a
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
change
their
product
design
or
to
install
some
particular
equipment.
they
could
make
a
cost-benefit
analysis
of
whether
assuming
the
risk
that
their
product
might
cause
a
danger
and
thereby
incur
liability
is
worth
the
cost
of
redesigning
the
equipment
or
putting
on
some
type
of
propeller
guard,
and
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
justice
scalia--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
i'm
trying
to
set
forth
the
reasons
why
in
1971,
when
congress
enacted
this
statute,
it
may
have
differentiated
it.
the
second
is
that
it
legislated
against
a
backdrop,
the
historical
traditions
of
the
country
that
if
people
were
injured
they
would
have
the
ability
to
bring
a
tort
claim,
and
so
the
words
that
it
used
in
setting
out
in
sections
4302,
4306,
and
4311(g)
used
words
that
suggest
positive
law
enactments
would
be
preempted
in
4306
and
that
common
law
liability
would
be
saved--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--no.
we
think
implied
conflict
preemption--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--principles
would
be
applicable.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
well,
the
savings
clause
should
not
be
read
to
eviscerate
the
power
that
congress
gave
the
coast
guard
to
promulgate
affirmative
regulations,
so
that
if
in
exercising
that
power
that
congress
gave
the
coast
guard
the
coast
guard
promulgates
a
regulation
that
prohibits
propeller
guards,
it
would
be
anomalous
to
read
the
savings
clause
to
bring
it
into
conflict
with
that.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
yes.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
that's
correct.
all
of
the--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--because
in
4306
the
words
that
congress
used,
it
started
out
by
saying,
unless
permitted
by
the
secretary,
and
everything
else
follows.
it
uses
terms
that
parallel
the
terms
that
were
used
in
4302
which
allow
the
secretary
to
prom...
to
establish
a
safety
standard.
if
you
then
look
at
4306
you
see
the
parallel
reference
to,
a
state
shall
not
be
allowed
to
do
a
law
or
regulation
that
establishes
a
standard
or
in
4302(a)(2)
it
says,
or
impose
a
requirement
or
require
a...
an
associated
equipment
device.
you
then
look
at
4306.
after
the
or,
it
says,
or
impose
a
requirement
for
associated
equipment.
in
our
view,
the
language
the
congress
used
in
4302
was
to
say,
these
are
the
things
that
the
secretary
is
authorized
to
issue
regulations
about,
and
then
in
4306
it
says,
unless
the
secretary
permits,
a
state
can't
do
those
things
which
the
secretary
is
empowered
to
do
in
4302,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
to
the
contrary,
justice
scalia.
if
a
regulation
that
a
state
promulgates
is
written
in
words
that
are
going
to
be
easily
compared
with
a
federal
standard
it
would
be
very
easy
to
determine
whether
it
was
identical
or
not
identical.
and
the
fact
that
congress
used
the
phrase,
liability
under
common
law
in
the
savings
provisions
4311(g),
but
did
not
use
the
phrase,
common
law
to
show
that
which
was
to
be
preempted
in
4306
is
further
textual
support
for
our
view
that
those
things
which
were
to
be
preempted
in
4306
were
positive
enactments
of
state
law
that
would
be
done
by
state
executive
officers
because,
in
fact,
they
will
have
to
apply
to
the
secretary
for
the
exemption
from
a
preemption,
and
they
are
the
ones
who
have
to
seek
that
authority
in
order
to
keep
that
in
place,
so
it
is
true
that--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
history
of
it
is
that
the
coast
guard
recognized
that
it
lacked
the
resources
in
order
to
enforce
all
of
these
provisions
with
the
tens
of
millions
of
boats
that
were
out
there,
so
in
fact
when
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
testified
he
urged
congress
to
provide
a
scheme
that
would
allow
states
to
promulgate
parallel...
an
identical
regulation
so
that
state
enforcement
officers
could
go
and
help
with
the
enforcement
of
the
safety
standards.
mr.
david
c.
frederick
it
wasn't
clear
at
the
time
whether
in
the
absence
of
that
explicit
authority
and
provision
that
state
officers
would
have
the
incentive
or
necessarily
the
power
to
do
that,
so
when
the
commandant
of
the
coast
guard
testified
before
the
senate
committee
he
made
very
clear
that
what
the
concern
that
the
coast
guard
had
was
the
positive
enactments
that
would
be
conflicting
with
state
law.
and
he
also
made
clear
in
response
to
a
written
question
that
was
given
to
him
in
advance
of
his
testimony
so
he
had
additional
time
to
think
about
it
that
private
remedies
would
be
available
to
people
if
they
were
injured
as
a
result
of
an
unsafe
device
that
was
put
on
a
boat.
so
we
think
the
legislative
history,
the
structure
and
the
text
make
very
clear
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
in
4306
was
to
deal
with
state
positive
law
enactments.
i
would
like
to
address,
briefly
address
the
respondent's
theory
of
the
savings
clause,
because
in
our
view
it
doesn't
really
make
that
much
sense.
they
have
two
theories.
the
first
is
that
the
savings
clause
was
intended
to
make
clear
that
there
was
to
be
no
affirmative
defense.
in
our
view,
that
is
incorrect,
because
it
was
black
letter
law
in
1971.
it
was
in
the
second
restatement
of
torts
in
section
288(c),
which
was
published
by
the
american
law
institute
in
1965.
the
compliance
with
a
legislative
enactment
or
a
regulation
would
not
relieve
someone
of
liability
if
a
reasonable
person
acting
under
the
same
or
similar
circumstances
would
do
otherwise.
so
that
theory
for
the
savings
clause
really
doesn't
make
much
sense.
there
would
have
been
no
need
for
congress
to
have
added
a
specific
savings
provision.
the
second
theory
that
they
have
is
that
the
savings
clause
was
intended
to
save
against
breach
of
warranty
or
manufacturing
defect
claims.
well,
that
theory
in
our
view
doesn't
make
any
sense
because
you
can't
read
4306
to
preempt
those
things,
so--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--well,
i
think--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--justice
scalia,
even
if
you
were
to
say
that
what
congress
was
intending
to
do
was
to
put
the
ali's
view
right
into
law,
the
words
that
congress
used
made
very
clear
that
general
provisions
of
common
law
liability
are
to
be
preserved,
because
it
didn't
say
liability
under
common
law,
especially
breach
of
warranty
or
product
defect
claims.
it
didn't
create
the
kind
of
textual
limitation
that
the
respondents
would
read
into
the
savings
clause.
so
i
think
that
if
you
look
at
the
way
that
respondent's
theory
spells,
you
know,
out
what
the
savings
clause
was
intended
to
do,
there
really
wouldn't
be
that
much
of
a
reason
to
do
it,
and--
mr.
david
c.
frederick
--thank
you.
