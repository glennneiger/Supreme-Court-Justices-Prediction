mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
we
heard
25
minutes
of
argument
this
morning
from
the
plaintiffs
and
the
solicitor
general
explaining
why
it's
perfectly
permissible
for
the
state
of
georgia
through
its
common
law
to
impose
a
requirement
that
boats
be
equipped
with
propeller
guards,
but
if
georgia
can
do
this,
then
presumably
south
carolina
could
through
its
common
law
impose
a
requirement
that
boats
not
be
equipped
with
propeller
guards
for
the
reasons
that,
as
the
coast
guard
found,
they
make
boats
less
safe.
now--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--no,
there's
no...
i
should
say
the
coast
guard
was
relying,
i
believe,
on
unanimous
recommendations
from
the...
from
its
subcommittee
on
propeller
guards
and
from
the
national
boating
safety
advisory
council,
each
of
whom
had
found
that
the
use
of
propeller
guards
would
demonstrably
make
boating
less
safe,
and
the
coast
guard--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--the
coast
guard--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--that's--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--that's
true,
justice
souter,
although
it
did
find...
it
did
agree
with
the
recommendations
of
the
underlying
committees
that
it
shouldn't
impose
a
prop
guard
requirement.
but
my
point
is
simply
that
the
accident
in
this
case
occurred
on
a
body
of
water
that
forms
part
of
the
border
between
south
carolina
and
georgia,
and
the
plaintiffs
and
the
solicitor
general
don't
bother
to
explain
how
a
manufacturer
could
possibly
build
a
boat
that
could
operate
on
that
body
of
water
and
still
comply
with
these
divergent
state
law.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
but
it
was
the
very
purpose
of
this
statute,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
very
purpose
of
this
statute
to
avoid
that
sort
of
a
problem.
in
fact,
the
senate
report
specifically
says
in
this
case
it
assures
that
manufacturers
for
the
domestic
trade
will
not...
will
not
involve...
will
not
have
to
worry
about
compliance
with
widely
varying
local
requirements.
that's
our
precise
point.
it
was
the
purpose
of
this
statute
to
avoid
a
situation--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--no,
it
doesn't,
and
no,
i
think
that
would
be
preempted
if
it
did
as
well.
my
point
is
simply
to
explain
why
there's
a
need
for
a
national
uniform
rule
here,
which
congress
recognized
in
passing
this
statute.
it's
so
you
have
one
single
rule
that
manufacturers
can
follow
throughout
the
united
states.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
but
the
language--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--i
think
that
the
language
of
the
preemption
provision,
justice
o'connor,
specifically
addresses
the
situation
and
provides,
as
the
solicitor
general
acknowledges,
the
coast
guard
has
always
interpreted
the
provision
according
to
its
plain...
the
coast
guard
has
always
interpreted
the
provision
according
to
its
plain
language
to
preempt
state
law
involving
design
and
equipment
requirements
even
in
the
absence
of
a
coast
guard
regulation
because
of
this
congressional
desire
to
have
uniform
national
requirements.
in
fact,
this
act
was
passed
in
1971.
the
day
after
the
act
was
passed...
the
day
after...
the
coast
guard
issued
a
regulation
under
section
4305
exempting
all
existing
state
requirements
from
preemption,
because--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--there
was
no...
it
simply
exempted
all
existing
state
requirements.
there
was
no
specific
discussion
of
statutes,
regulations,
common
law.
the
point
is--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--no.
i'm
taking
from
that
the
understanding,
which
has
been
in
existence
since
the
beginning
of
the
statute,
that
even
in
the
absence
of
a
regulation
section
4306
would
provide
for
preemption
from
state
law.
that
was
the
point
that
i
think
comes
through
clearly.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
that's
true.
that's
why
it
seems
completely
irrational
for
congress
to
have
prohibited
state
legislatures
or
state
boating
commissioners
from
entering
this
area,
because
it
was
concerned
about
the
need
for
national
uniform
regulation,
one
rule
that
every
manufacturer
could
follow
throughout
the
united
states,
and
to
create
an
exception
for
common
law
rules,
which
is
i
think
the
point
that
justice
breyer
made
last
year
in
his
separate
opinion
in
medtronic,
but--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--two
requirements,
justice...
two
responses,
justice
souter.
the
first
is
i
think
that
misstates
what
the
advisory
committee,
commission
did
here.
it
tested
every
type
of
propeller
guard
in
existence,
and
it
concluded
that
there
was
no
feasible
workable
propeller
guard
that
could
be
used
on
any
type
of
motor
boat,
so
i
don't
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
it
simply
said
there
wasn't
one
that
could
be
used
on
every
boat.
it
tested
every
single--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--exactly.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
in
every
case
in
which
a
motor
boat
was
going
more
than
10
miles
an
hour.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
find
any
application
in
which
it
would
be
safe
to
require
that
a
motor
boat
be
equipped
with
a
propeller
guard.
but
the
second
answer
to
your
question,
justice
souter,
frankly
is
that
this
is
an
argument
that
i
think...
and
justice
scalia
said
this
this
morning...
the
court
has
heard
many
previous
times
when
faced
with
statutes
of
this
type
and
has
never
drawn
an
exception
between
statutory
requirements
and
common
law
requirements.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes,
and
the
language
in
this
statute
i
think
is
indistinguishable,
justice
stevens,
from--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes.
the
list...
this
statute
does.
in
fact,
it
might
be
useful
to
focus
on
the
specific
language
at
issue
here,
because
i
think
it
answers
a
lot
of
questions.
the
section--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
the
statute,
for
example,
that
was
at
issue
in
ray
v.
atlantic-richfield,
which
this
court
considered
20
years
ago,
had
that
very
language
in
there,
and
the
court
said
that
didn't
mean
there
was
no
preemption.
it
simply
meant
the
manufacturers--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
what
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--that's
not
the
argument...
the
court
rejected
that
very
argument
in
ray
v.
atlantic-richfield,
your
honor.
they're
minimum
in
the
sense
that
manufacturers
could
add
to
that.
they're
not
minimum
in
the
sense
that
states
could
add
to
that.
that
would
make...
there
would
be
no
reason
for
preemption
if
they
were...
if
that
reading
of
minimum
standards
were
correct.
there
would
be
no
reason
to
have
a
preemption
clause
in
there.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
as
recently
as
last
august,
justice
ginsburg,
the
coast
guard
again
asked
for
comments
from
people
as
to
whether
there
would
be
a
workable
type
of
propeller
guard
that
the
coast
guard
could
consider.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
they
haven't
yet
issued
any
regulation
presumably
because
they
haven't
yet
been
satisfied
that
they
can
meet
the
standards
of
4302,
which
is
to
say
that
the
requirement
that
the
propeller
guard
would
actually
advance
the
interest
of
boat
safety.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
no.
i
don't
believe
anything
has
happened
since
august
of
1997.
let
me
just
focus
if
i
could
the
court
on
the
language
of
4306.
it's
reprinted
in
a
number
of
different
places,
including
page
6
of
the
red
brief,
and
it's
helpful
to
focus
on
the
language.
this
language,
justice
stevens,
is
i
think
identical
in
respect
to
the
language
that
the
court
had
before
it
in
medtronic
and
in
cipollone.
section
4306
has
a
broad
requirement
that...
broad
preemptions
that
the
state
may
not
establish
or
enforce
a
law
imposing
a
requirement
for
associated
equipment,
which
is...
no
one
disputes
that
a
propeller
guard
here
is
associated
equipment,
and
the
court
has
held
in
cipollone,
in
easterwood,
in
norfolk
and
western
railway,
in
medtronic,
that
the
word
requirement
in
those
very
similar
statutes
includes
common
law
claims.
in
fact,
i
don't
know
of
any
case
in
this
court
that
has
ever
construed
the
word
requirement
to
include
only
positive
law,
and
the
court
on
a
number
of
occasions
has
rejected
that
very
argument.
the
court--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--law
or--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes.
i
think
the--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--i
think
the
language
in
medtronic
was
very,
very
similar.
the
law
here
is
the
common
law,
which
establishes
a
requirement
for
associated
equipment.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
because
i
think
that
section
43...
section
4306
enacts
a
general
preemption
rule
that
says
no
state
can
impose
a
requirement
for
associated
equipment.
now,
there
are--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--absolutely.
for
the
purposes
of--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes,
for
purposes
of
our
express
preemption.
now,
here
we
have
a
very
powerful
implied
preemption
argument
as
well,
which
i'll
get
to
in
a
minute,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
coast
guard
did
do
a
thorough
study,
but
that's
right,
and
this
is,
of
course,
the
way
the
coast
guard
has
interpreted
this
statute
over
the
years.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
that
would
make
no
sense.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
you
couldn't
have
any--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--not
all
of
state
tort...
i
think
the
breadth
of
this
argument
has
been
grossly
overstated,
justice
breyer.
the
states
have
a
large
role
to
play
under
the
boat
safety
act,
but
in
terms
of
boat
safe
use
and
operation,
boater
education,
boat
numbering,
tort
law
can
apply
in
case
of
manufacturing
defects
involving
boats,
and--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes,
and--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--of
design.
design.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
because,
as
congress
said...
as
congress
said,
there
has
to
be
a
uniform
national
rule
for
design
requirements.
you
can't
build
a
boat,
one
boat
for
south
carolina
and
another
boat
for
georgia,
and
that's
precisely--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--absolutely.
in
fact,
i
want
to
turn--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--4305.
4305,
justice
kennedy.
that's
exactly
right.
i
think
if
you
look
at
section
4306,
which
i
keep
wanting
to
bring
the
court
back
to
because
that's
the
issue
in
this
case,
is
how
to
interpret
that
provision,
there
are
a
number
of
exceptions
that
congress
has
written
into
the
preemption
provision.
there's
a
general
preemption
provision
of
state
design
requirements
for
the
reasons
i
gave,
that
there
has
to
be
uniformity
in
design
requirements.
you
can't
have...
you
have
to
have
a
single
national
rule,
which
is
precisely
what
the
senate
report
says.
it
assures
that
manufacturers
will
not
have
to
worry
about
compliance
with
widely
varying
local
requirements.
and
then
there
are
three
exceptions
to
narrow
it
in
section
4306.
first
of
all,
as
justice
kennedy
said,
the
coast
guard
can
draft
an
exemption
to
allow
states
to
have
a
rule
involving
design
of
boats.
second,
even
when
the
coast
guard
hasn't
granted
an
exemption--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes,
4306.
4305
allows
the
coast
guard
to
grant
the
exemption,
but
it's...
4306
says
that
there's
a
general
preemption
of
state
requirements
involving
the
design
and
equipment
of
boats,
but
the
coast
guard
can
grant
an
exemption
to
the
states.
secondly,
the
states
can
operate...
their
state
law
can
operate
to
meet
some
uniquely
hazardous
local
condition,
and
third,
the
states
are
allowed
to
enforce
their
law
about
the
design
of
boats
to
the
extent
that
it
is
identical
to
a
regulation
promulgated
by
the
coast
guard,
and
the
scheme
of
this
is
obvious.
the
coast
guard
is
supposed
to
promulgate
the
rules
that
tell
manufacturers
what
they
have
to
do
in
order
to
build
a
boat,
a
recreational
boat
in
interstate
commerce,
and
the
states
can
enforce...
if
the
state
law
is
identical
to
it,
the
states
can
participate
in
the
enforcement.
so
if
a
boat
is
built
out
of
compliance
with
federal
design
requirements,
there
can
be
a
state
law
remedy,
but
the
states
can't
add
to
the
requirement.
so
that
they...
so
that
here,
for
example,
you
know,
you
could
have
a
state
requirement
that
has...
that
it
requires
that
boats
be
built
with
propeller
guards.
that
would
be
a
requirement
only
for
one
state.
it
would
dictate
the
national
rule
and,
if
a
state
had
a
contrary
rule,
you
couldn't
sell
a
boat
in
interstate
commerce,
because
one
state
could
say
you
had
to
have
one
type
of
requirement,
another
state
could
say
you
have
to
have
another.
the
idea
of
this
was
to
have
a
uniform
national
rule,
and
as...
the
court
actually
confronted
a
case
almost
precisely
like
this
20
years
ago,
ray
v.
atlantic
richfield.
that
was
a
case
in
which
congress
passed
a
statute
that
promulgated...
that
authorized
the
coast
guard
to
promulgate
design
requirements
for
tankers,
and
the
coast
guard
in
fact
did.
it
promulgated
a
long
list
of
design
requirements
for
tankers,
and
then
the
state
of
washington
came
in
and
passed
a
statute
that
said,
if
you
want
to
operate
in
puget
sound,
you
also
have
to
follow
the
following
three
additional
design
requirements.
you
have
to
have
double
hulls,
you
have
to
have
two
radar,
working
radar,
and
this
court
held
that
that
statute
was
preempted.
it
was
preempted
actually
in
the
absence
of
an
express
preemption
provision.
but
the
reason
the
court
gave
is...
applies
here
like
a
glove.
the
court
said,
enforcement
of
these
state
requirements
would
frustrate
what
seems
to
us
to
be
the
evident
congressional
intent
to
establish
a
uniform
federal
regime
controlling
the
design
of
oil
tankers.
this
is
435
u.s.
at
page
151.
it's
precisely
the
same
thing
here.
in
fact,
here
there's
even
more
evidence
that
that's
what
congress
wanted
to
do,
because
there's
an
express
preemption
provision
that
says
that
that's
what
they're
trying
to
do.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
let's
talk
about
the
savings
clause.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
i
don't
think
a
fair
reading
of
the
savings
clause
cuts
the
other
way,
justice
o'connor,
but
let's
look
at
that
as
well.
this
is
on
page
2
of
the
red
brief.
what
it
literally
says...
what
it
literally
says
is
that
compliance
with
a
federal
regulation
or
order
does
not
relieve
a
person
from
liability
at
common
law
or
under
state
law,
and
the
legislative
history
uses
almost
the
exact
same
language
to
describe
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here.
what
congress
was
trying
to
do
here,
quite
specifically,
and
it
says
it
literally,
is
that
in
those
areas
where
state
law
still
has
a
role
to
play,
areas
that
are
not
preempted,
it
is
not
a
defense
to
that
state
law
claim
that
you've
complied
with
the
federal
regulation.
that's
precisely
what
this
says,
and
that's
all
that
this
says.
it
says
nothing
about
preemption,
and
if
it
were
truly
a
savings
clause
intended
to
create
a
gaping
hole
in
section
4306,
you'd
think
it
would
have
been
put
in
section
4306.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
one
example
might
be,
justice
scalia,
if
a
state
had
a
design
requirement
that
was
not
preempted
because
it
was
intended
to
deal
with
uniquely
hazardous
local
conditions.
that's
not
preempted
under
section
4306.
or
the
state
may
have
a
design--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--you
need
a
savings
clause,
justice
souter,
for
fear
that
the...
that
it
might
be
perceived
under
state
law
that
it's
a
complete
defense
that
you've
complied
with
the
federal
regulation.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
well,
i
think
actually,
justice
scalia,
that's
precisely
what
the
legislative
history
again
says
this
was
trying
to
do,
because
when
it
discusses
the
savings
clause,
which
i
should
say
was
added
at
the
last
minute--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--i'm
talking
to
the
court.
but
it
does
explain
what
this...
what
4311(g)
is
intended
to
do.
it
says,
of
course,
in
describing
4311(g)
and
the
reason
they
put
it
in,
of
course,
depending
on
the
rules
of
evidence
of
the
particular
judicial
forum,
such
compliance...
in
other
words,
compliance
with
federal
regulations...
may
or
may
not
be
admissible
for
its
evidentiary
value.
in
other
words,
they
couldn't
possibly
have
been
talking
about
federal
preemption
here.
they
were
talking
about
state
rules,
and
contrary--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--i
think
that
that
claim
would...
the
failure
to
warn
about
the
absence
of
propeller
guards?
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
i
think...
i
think
that
would
probably
be
preempted
as
well
because
of
the
effect
it
would
have
on
manufacturers
to
build
their
boats
to...
in
other
words,
the
failure
to
warn
would
have
to
warn
about
some
dangerous,
perhaps
defective
condition
that--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--there
isn't
a
failure
to
warn
claim
in
this
case--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--and
it's
an
interesting
question.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
know
the
right
answer,
but
i
think
the
argument
would
be
that
if
you
allowed
failure
to
warn
claims
in
that
situation
it
would
impose
pressure
on
manufacturers
to
put
on
the
device
that
would
eliminate
the
need
to
make
the
warning,
and
that
would
be
a--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--there
are
warning
requirements
in
the
act
as
well,
federal
warning
requirements,
and
it
may
be
that
those
would
preempt
a
state
warning
requirement,
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
this
is
a
pure
design
requirement.
they're
saying
this
boat
is
defective
because
it
didn't
have
a
propeller
guard,
and
what
i'm
saying
is
that
section
4306
addresses
that
question
precisely
and
says
that
the...
what
equipment
a
boat
operating
in
interstate
commerce
should
have
is
a
question
reserved
to
the
coast
guard.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
it's
defined
in
coast
guard
regulations
as
associated
equipment.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
right,
and
we
are
relying...
this
case
involves
the
section
of
4306
that
talks
about
imposing
a
equipment
for
associated--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--a
requirement
for
associated
equipment,
that's
right.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
there
are
many
types...
first
of
all,
i'm
not
sure
that
congress
necessarily
had
in
mind
a
specific
situation.
they
were
told--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--yes.
any
case
in
which
state
law
has
a
role
to
play.
there
could
be
a
tort
claim
that
the
boat
was
defectively
manufactured
because
something
was
done
in
a
particular
way
and
the--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--suggestion
is
that
you
shouldn't
allow
the
preemption
provision
to
be
broadened
beyond
congress'
intent
by
allowing
the
defense
to
argue
that
mere
compliance...
mere
compliance
with
the
federal
regulations
is
a
defense
under
state
law.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
i
mean,
it
could
have.
it
could
have.
i
mean,
in
other
words--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--well--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--that's
one
example,
but
you
have
to
remember,
justice
scalia,
this
was
added
at
the
last
minute.
this
was
not
part
of
the
original
bill.
it
was
stuck
in
at
the
senate
committee
level
at
the
last
minute
because
someone
suggested
there
might
be
a
problem
here,
let's
put
this
in,
but--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--but
the
other
key
point...
i
mean,
i
think
the
achille's
heel
of
the
plaintiffs'
and
any
attempt
to
rely
on
section
4311(g)
is
that
it
doesn't
distinguish
at
all
between
common
law
and
state
law.
i
think
the
court
would
have
to
commit
an
unnatural
act
with
that
language
to
draw
a
distinction
between
the
common
law
and
state
law
for
purposes
of
preemption,
and
if...
and
if
it
saved
all
state
law,
which
is
the
only
logical
reading
of
it,
if
it
saves
common
law
claims,
if
it
saves
state
law
claims
there's
no
preemption
at
all.
it
eliminates
completely
section
4306.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
there
could
be
a
claim...
there
could
well
be
a
state
law
claim
because
we
would
not
be
within
state
4306,
that
the
boat
was
not
manufactured
according
to
its
design
requirements.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes,
but
there
aren't
manufacturing
requirements.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
in
other
words,
if,
for
example,
the
coast
guard
had
a
propeller...
had
a
propeller
guard
requirement--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--and
you
complied
fully
with...
you
put
the
propeller
guard
on
your
boat,
so
you
satisfied
the
design
requirements,
but
you
didn't
fasten
it
properly.
it
should
have
been
fastened
with
four
bolts
and
you
only
put
two
on,
and
it
fell
off
in
the
water,
there
would
be,
i
think,
a
plausible--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--failure
to
manufacture--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--right.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
right.
but
you
see,
the...
justice
stevens,
the
precise
difference
between
that
hypothetical--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--a
failure
to
manufacture
claim
only
requires
the
manufacturer
to
comply
with
his
own
or
the
coast
guard's
design
requirements.
it
doesn't
add
any
design
requirements.
the
problem
with
allowing
the
states
to
impose
design
requirements--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--because
how
the
boat
is
to
be
designed
and
what
equipment
the
boat
is
to
have
on
it
is
a
question
reserved
to
the
coast
guard
or
else
you
can't
have
a
uniform
national
rule.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
no.
no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
there
would
be
a
uniform
national
rule.
you
have
to
build
your
boat
consistent
with
the
design
requirements.
now,
if
in
a
particular
case
you
don't--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--no,
but
in
one
case
you're
simply
being
asked
to
comply
with
your
own
design
requirements.
if
your
own
design
requirement
says
it
should
have
four
bolts,
you
have
to
have
four
bolts.
if
you
only
put
two
in,
it's
a
manufacturing
defect.
that's
a
clear
claim
that
can
be
brought
under
state
law.
we
have
a
completely
different
type
of
claim
in
this
case.
they're
claiming
it
should
have
been
designed
differently.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
right.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
i
thought
justice
stevens
was
referring
to
a
manufacturing
defect,
a
failure
to
comply
with
your
own
design
requirements
or
the
coast
guard's
design
requirements.
there's
a
single
set
of
design
requirements.
you
have
to
comply
with
it,
and
if
you
don't,
you're
liable
as
a
manufacturer
for
having
a
manufacturing
defect.
that
doesn't
prevent
you
from
manufacturing
one
type
of
boat
throughout
the
united
states.
when
you're
dealing
with
a
design
requirement
where
each
state
can
impose
its
own
design
requirement,
it
is
impossible
to
build
a
single
boat
that
operates
throughout
the
united
states,
and
that's
precisely
what
the
legislative
history
said
congress
had
in
mind
and
wanted
uniform
national
design
and
equipment
requirements.
manufacturing
requirements
are
of
a
totally
different
order.
you
simply
screwed
up
with
one
particular
boat.
it
doesn't
tell
you
anything
at
all
about
how
you
have
to
build
the
generality
of
your
boats.
now,
i
just
want
to
turn
for
a
minute
to
implied
preemption,
which
provides
a
separate
and
totally
independent
basis
for
preemption
here.
the...
even
if
the...
even
if
4306
didn't
cover
this
situation,
it's
clear
that
it
would...
the
state
law
claim
here
would
be
impliedly
preempted,
because
it
plainly
frustrates
what
congress
and
the
coast
guard
were
trying
to
do
in
this
area.
i
don't
know
of
any
piece
of
equipment
that's
been
more
thoroughly
studied
by
the
coast
guard
than
prop
guards,
and
the
advisory
committee
and
the
subcommittee
on
prop
guards
took
18
months,
they
looked
at
all
the
available
data,
they
took
a
boat
out
onto
boston
harbor
and
operated
it
both
with
and
without
prop
guards,
they
held
hearings
across
the
country--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--well,
i
don't
know,
justice
ginsburg.
that's
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general.
the
coast...
i
find
it
interesting,
the
department
of
transportation
did
not
sign
this
brief,
which
is
not
typical
of
its
practice.
it's
signed
other
briefs
in
this
court
in
cases
like
myrick
in
recent
years,
so
i
don't
know
what
the
position
of
the
coast
guard
is.
the
coast
guard
has
clearly
held
that
even
in
the
absence
of
a
federal
regulation
there
is
preemption
of
state
law.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
yes.
my
point,
justice
scalia--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--all
i'm
saying,
justice
scalia,
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
is,
i
don't
know
of
any
pronouncement
by
the
coast
guard,
ever,
that
has
ever
drawn
a
distinction
between--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--well,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
coast
guard
has
never--
[laughter]
and
i
think
it's
an
important
point.
the
coast
guard
has
never,
ever
drawn
a
distinction
between
state,
regulatory,
statutory,
or
common
law
requirements,
ever,
and
i
think
it
would
be
inconsistent
for
the
coast
guard
to
do
that,
given
the
fact
that
common
law
requirements
can
frustrate
what
they're
trying
to
do,
as
this
case
shows
every
bit
as
much
as
a
state
statutory
or
regulatory--
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
--right.
mr.
kenneth
steven
geller
right,
and
i
don't
know
of
any
instance
in
which
they
have
ever
said,
contrary,
for
example,
to
in
medtronic,
where
the
fda
had
a
regulation
that--
