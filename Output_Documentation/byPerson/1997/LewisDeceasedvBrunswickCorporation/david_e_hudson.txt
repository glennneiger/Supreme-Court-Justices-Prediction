mr.
david
e.
hudson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
plaintiffs'
claims
that
brunswick
negligently
failed
to
protect
against
propeller
guard
injuries
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
should
not
be
preempted
for
three
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
claims
we
are
bringing
in
this
case
do
not
conflict
with
any
federal
regulation.
under
freightliner,
there's
no
preemption.
secondly,
the
text
of
the
preemption
clause,
section
4306
of
the
act,
does
not,
much
less
clearly
and
unambiguously,
reach
the
body
of
state
law
of
general
application,
common
law
damage
claims.
our
position
there
is
consistent,
we
think,
with
all
of
the
preemption
cases
of
this
court.
thirdly,
in
this
case
the
reading
that
we
submit
for
the
preemption
clause
is
confirmed
by
a
particular
savings
clause,
where
congress
specifically
and
without
qualification
provided
that
compliance
with
the
boat
safety
act
regulation
is
no
defense
to
common
law
claims.
in
this
preemption
case,
as
in
every
case
of
statutory
interpretation,
surely
the
starting
point
is
the
text
of
the
act
itself.
we
submit
in
this
case
it
is
also
the
ending
point.
starting
with
a
statement
of
purpose
in
the
policy
declaration--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--i
will
tone
it
down--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--chief
justice.
starting
with
the
policy
declaration
in
section
2
of
the
act,
congress
spoke
of
reciprocity
and
comity,
signal
words
that
state
law
has
a
role
to
play.
it
spoke
of
developing
and
enforcing
federal
and
state
laws,
again
signalling
that
state
laws
would
have
a
role
to
play.
and
then
throughout
the
act
congress
over
and
over
again
speaks
of
the
enactment
of
positive
regulations
both
by
the
federal
government
and
by
the
state,
never
any
reference
to
common
law
claims.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
yes,
your
honor,
there
has
a
been
a
holding
that
the
common
law
can
lead
to
a
requirement.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--well,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
the
language
used
in
this
statute
is
different
than
the
language
used
in
both
cipollone
and
in
medtronic.
in
this
statute,
congress
says
that
there
may
not
be
a
state
law
or
regulation.
in
both
cipollone
and
medtronic
it
was
a
requirement
which
arose
under
state
law
and
this
court
has,
in
a
number
of
cases,
not
only
in
cipollone
but
following
that
in
medtronic,
english
v.
ge,
goodyear
v.
miller,
silkwood,
has
explained
that
common
law
is
a
traditional
state
area.
if
we
were
to
obtain
a
judgment
in
this
case,
brunswick
would
not
be
required
to
put
a
propeller
guard
on
any
of
its
boats
in
any
state,
or
in
any
jurisdiction.
it
would
have
the
discretion
as
a
manufact--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--even
then--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--even
then,
your
honor,
it
may
not
be
necessary
that
they
actually
install
a
propeller
guard.
it
may
be
enough
that
a
warning
be
issued
putting
consumers
on
notice
that
if
you
are
thrown
or
fall
out
of
this
boat
there's
a
danger
of
this
type
of
injury.
we
assert
in
our
complaint
that
they
had
this
knowledge,
and
they
had--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--to
award
compensation
to
the
injured
victim
is
the
first
purpose.
the
punitive
damage
claim
is
a
heightened
incentive
to
do
the
steps
that
are
necessary
to
protect
persons
who
use
the
boats.
it
would
have
that
impact.
but
as
this
court
acknowledged
in
silkwood,
punitive
damage
is
a
customary
part
of
the
state
common
law
damage
scheme
and
just
because
it's
a
punitive
damage
claim
married
with
a
claim
for
general
damages
does
not
create
any
heightened
point
of
reference
to
preempt
a
state
law
claim.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
under
that
reading
it
wouldn't
make
sense,
justice
breyer,
and
i'd
like
to--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--may
i
assume
in
your
question
that
you
are
referring
to
the
coast
guard
adopting
a
regulation
saying
thou
shalt
not
have
propeller
guards,
and
then
not
as
a
matter
of
preemption,
but
i
think
as
a
matter
of
the
supremacy
clause
and
cases
like
american
airlines
v.
wollands
and
the
case
that
was
cited
from
1907.
if
the
state
attempts
to
do
something
it
is
in
conflict
with
the
regulation
by
supremacy
clause
analysis--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--well--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--it's...
i
think
you
have
to
go
one
word
further.
back
in
the
savings
clause
it
refers
to
liability
under
common
law
or
state
law,
is
what
is
preserved,
and--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--no.
i
think
it
is...
that
is
a
liability
claim
under
state
law,
but
you
asked
what
is
the
purpose
of
the
savings
clause
if
you
cannot
bring
a
claim
that
is
diametrically
opposed
to
a
federal
regulation,
which
is
not
our
case.
i
concede
that
if--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--no,
sir,
i
think
that
is
our
view,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
well,
it
depends
on
whether
or
not
there's
a
conflict,
because
if
they
say
thou
shalt
not
have
a
propeller
guard,
then
our
claim
would
be
barred.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
well--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--fortunately,
that's
not
our
case,
but
i
do--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--i
do
concede--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--well,
our
theory
is
that
there
is
no
conflict.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
no,
we
don't,
justice
souter.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
that
is
statutory
evidence,
along
with
some
pretty
extensive
legislative
history,
that
all
concerned
thought
that
common
law
claims
would
survive
even
after
the
adoption
of
this
act.
it
is
additional
authority
for
the
proposition
that
what
was
preempted
in
section
4306
were
positive
enactments
under
a
state
legislative
law
on
affirmative
regulation.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
justice
scalia,
you
backed
up
in
that
statute.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
liability.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
for
example,
justice
scalia,
in
our
case
we
are
bringing
a
negligence...
we
have
a
negligence
count.
we
have
a
wrongful
death
count.
the
wrongful
death
count
is
a
statutory
claim
in
georgia.
it's
been
in
existence
for
over
100
years,
so
that
is
a
liability
claim...
that's
certainly
not
common
law.
i
don't
think
wrongful
death
was
recognized
at
the
common
law.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
the
difference,
i
think,
chief
justice,
is
it
is
not
a
law
aimed
specifically
at
boating
requirements.
what
congress
was
addressing
in
4306
was
acts
and
regulations
enacted
by
a
state
and
particularly
applied
to
boat
safety.
these
are
laws
of
general
application,
much
as
has
been
said
you
might
have
a
zoning
law
or
a
general
safety
law.
these
are
different
from
what
congress
preempted
in
the
section
under
question.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
i
think
that
is
the
most
logical
reading,
because
when
you
read
4306
in
conjunction
with
4305,
what
you
are
permitted
to
obtain
exemption
from
if
you
apply
to
the
coast
guard
is
from
existing
rules
and
regulations
of
the
coast
guard.
furthermore,
if
you
read
the
statute
where
it
says
at
the
conclusion,
unless
identical
to
a
regulation
comprised
under
section
4302,
that's
surplus.
if
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
say
the
only
regulation
we're
going
to
have
are
positive
enactments
of
the
coast
guard,
then
you
don't
need
that
language
in
the
statue
that
says,
unless
identical
to
the
regulations
prescribed
under
this
section.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
to
that
i
would
respond,
justice
souter,
that
the
former
reading,
why
do
you
need
state
laws
that
simply
parrot
an
existing
federal
regulation
that
has
been
enacted
by
the
coast
guard.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
the
conduct
is
being
regulated.
i
would
further
say,
if
you
have
a
statue
that
can
be
read
both
ways
under
the
clear
and
unambiguous
standard
that
this
court
cites
in
every
one
of
its
preemption
cases,
that
in
itself
proves
that
at
the
very
least
this
would
be
an
ambiguous
statute.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
that
is
correct,
because
from
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
act
and
through
the
present
time
the
coast
guard
has
never
taken
the
position
that
common
law
claims
of
general
application
of
state
laws
are
preempted.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
at
least
the
underlying
facts
that
caused
the
coast
guard
not
to
do
anything,
and
the
coast
guard
decided
not
to
do
anything
because
they
couldn't
come
up
with
a
common
solution
and
it
might
expensive
and
the
data
was
incomplete.
now,
the
study
committee
said
some
other
things,
but
the
coast
guard
letter
was
general
in
that
nature.
yes,
i
think
the
underlying
facts
about
whether
propeller
guards
are
safe
or
not
safe
do
come
into
evidence.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
yes,
i
think
that
could,
because
it
will
be
a
very
limited
application,
even
when
it
comes
in,
because
the
coast
guard's
action
was
very
narrow
in
scope,
the
letter
that
adopted
the
position
of
the
subcommittee
that
studied
propeller
guards.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
well,
i
think
i
do
know
that
much,
your
honor.
in
product
liability
cases
in
georgia
there's
a
recent
supreme
court
decision
we
cite
in
our
brief,
and
it
allows
all
of
these
factors
to
come
into
evidence,
whether
they
are
other
designs,
whether
they
are
federal
regulations,
or
federal
authorities.
the
whole
mix
goes
into
the
jury's
determination
of
whether
or
not
this
was
too
dangerous
for
use
under
this
application.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
your
honor,
i
can't...
we'll
look
in
the
blue
brief.
i
think
4305
is
the
statute
that
allows
the
regulations
to
be
established.
other
than
the
fact
that--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--for
an
exemption.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
okay.
that's
right.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
it's...
if
we
haven't
set
it
forth,
your
honor,
that's
an
oversight,
but
it
simply
says
the
coast
guard
can
grant
an
exemption
from
an
existing
act
or
a
regulation
that
the
coast
guard
has
adopted,
not
an
exemption
from
the
wiping-of-the-slate
clean
notion
that
brunswick
submits
in
this
case.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
in
regard
to
the
position
of
the
coast
guard,
i
think
in
footnote
2
of
the
blue
brief
the
statement
of
the
commandant
at
the
time
the
legislation
was
enacted
is
pretty
compelling.
without
any
qualification,
without
any
cramp
reading,
the
commandant
understood
that
the
usual
tort
law
concerning
negligence
and
warranties
would
survive
the
enactment
of
this
law.
it's
consistent
with
the
statement
quoted
on
page
6
of
the
blue
brief
by
the
executive
director
of
the
boatowners
association,
who
suggested
a
need
for
a
provision
in
the
law
to
make
it
clear
that
common
law
claims
would
survive.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
yes,
during
the
senate
committee
hearings
in
response
to
a
question
from
the
committee.
mr.
david
e.
hudson
further
evidence
of
the
agency's
position
i
think,
justice
scalia,
is
found
in
those
1971
and
1973
federal
register
provisions
that
are
cited
in
all
of
the
briefs
where
the
coast
guard
specifically
left
in
place
all
laws
enacted
by
the
states
prior
to
1971.
it
was
talking
about
statutory
enactments,
even
felt
no
need
to
even
speak
to
the
common
law.
if
they're
going
to
allow
the
state
law
enactments
to
stay
in
place,
surely
the
common
law
survives
as
well
and,
in
fact,
i
don't
know
that
there's
any
recision
of
those
1971
exemptions
from
preemption.
the
claims
we're
making
here,
the
georgia
wrongful
death
statute
is
over
100
years
old,
the
negligence
standard
has
existed
for
as
long
as
the
state
of
georgia
has
existed,
so
the
common
law
has
never
been
a
focus
of
the
coast
guard
restriction,
or
any
need
to
exempt
from
preemption
common
law
claims.
in
regard
to
the
case
of
ray
v.
atlantic
richfield,
it
does
not
fit
this
case.
that
was
a
situation
where
the
coast
guard
was
directed...
the
statute
said
it
shall
issue
the
regulations
governing
the
size
of
tankers
and
other
activities
on
the
coast.
the
coast
guard
in
fact
enacted
regulations.
and
if
the
state
of
washington
was
able
to
put
a
limit
on
tanker
sizes,
contrary
to
what
the
coast
guard
had
done,
it
would
be
the
hypothetical
justice
breyer
presented
this
morning.
you
would
have
a
conflict,
and
under
the
supremacy
clause,
the
state
may
not
act
contrary
to
any
established
regulation
of
the
coast
guard
and
in
this
case
we
don't
have
an
established
regulation.
finally,
i
would
submit--
mr.
david
e.
hudson
--i
agree
there
would
be
no
conflict,
justice
scalia.
if
we
are
able
to
prevail
on
a
damage
claim
there
would
be
no
conflict.
it
seems
to
me,
your
honors,
that
for
brunswick
to
prevail
and
for
preemption
to
exist
in
this
case
five
very
high
hurdles
have
to
be
overcome.
they
must
overcome
the
presumption
against
the
displacement
of
state
law.
they
must
overcome
the
requirement
that
preemption
be
manifest
and
clear
purpose
of
congress.
they
must
overcome
the
lack
of
any
statutory
or
legislative
history
showing
an
intent
to
restrict
the
common
law.
they
must
overcome
the
common
understanding
of
the
words
used
in
section
4306.
justice
stevens,
in
cipollone
you
made
a
distinction
between
a
preemption
of
requirements
and
in
the
senate
draft
in
the
tobacco
legislation
they
talked
about
a
statute
or
regulation.
that
was
changed
to
a
requirement,
and
you
pointed
out
one
would
be
preempted
and
the
other
would
not.
and
finally,
they
would
have
to
overcome
the
express
mention
of
the
common
law
in
the
savings
provision
in
this
case.
on
the
other
hand,
this
is
a
preemption
case,
after
all.
the
federal
agency
with
the
authority
to
regulate
agrees
that
common
law
claims
should
not
be
barred,
or,
indeed,
there
is
no
conflict
between
anything
claimed
in
our
lawsuit
and
any
existing
regulation
of
the
coast
guard
and,
if
our
claims
are
successful,
we
will
only
enhance
the
ultimate
goal
of
the
boat
safety
act,
which
was
to
improve
safety
for
people
using
boats.
thank
you,
your
honors.
