mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
setting
for
this
statutory
interpretation
case
is,
alas,
subchapter
l
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
which
contains,
as
this
court
has
recognized,
highly
specialized,
carefully
crafted
rules
for
determining
the
taxable
income
of
insurance
companies.
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
case
is
straightforward
and
very
simply
stated.
in
connection
with
a
transition
rule
that
congress
adopted
in
1986
with
respect
to
a
change
in
the
taxations
methodology
for
unpaid
losses
of
insurance
companies,
it
provided
fresh
start
relief,
a
very
favorable
provision,
but
excluded
from
that
fresh
start
relief
reserve
strengthening.
reserve
strengthening
was
the
term
of
art
that
congress
used
in
the
statute.
reserve
strengthening
had,
in
1986,
a
decades
old
meaning
in
insurance
tax
law.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
the...
i...
it's
unclear,
actually,
justice
ginsburg,
the
extent
to
which
the
government
disputes
the
history
of
the
meaning
of
reserve
strengthening
in
insurance
tax
law.
in
this
case
below
and
in
the
western
national
case
the
government
conceded
that
the
term,
reserve
strengthening
had
a
clear
meaning
in
the
context
of
life
insurance
taxation.
it
disputed
whether
the
meaning
was
clear
in
the
context
of
property
and
casualty
tax--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--the
government--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--in
the
context
of
this
case
it
is
petitioner's
position
that
the
term,
reserve
strengthening,
was
a
tax
term
of
art,
that
congress
knew
precisely
what
the
term
meant
when
it
used
it,
that
in
fact
the
distinction
between
life
insurance
and
property
casualty
insurance
in
this
context
is
really
not
at
all
relevant.
the...
subchapter
l
of
the
internal
revenue
code
covers
both
types
of
companies.
this
provision
applied
to
both...
it's
been
loosely
called
a
provision
that
applies
to
property
and
casualty
companies
but,
in
fact,
it
applies
to
both
life
insurance
companies
and
property
and
casualty
companies
and,
indeed,
the
difference
between
life
and...
what
we're
calling
life
insurance
companies
and
property
casualty
companies
really,
in
subchapter
l
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
is
only
a
question
of
the
relationship
between
the
amount
of
reserves
they
hold
to
qualify
as
life
insurance
reserves
and
the
amount
of
reserves
they
hold
that
are--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--insofar
as
relevant
to
this
case,
justice
o'connor,
there
are
none.
there
are
differences,
because
obviously
a
life
insurance
policy
covers
one
sort
of
risk
and
a
property
casualty
insurance
policy
covers
a
different
sort
of
risk.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
all
right,
i
need
to
back
up
just
a
step,
justice
breyer.
the...
first
with
respect
to
the
comparability
of
the
businesses,
they
surely
cover
two
different
types
of
risk.
i
think
justice
o'connor's
question
had
to
do
with
the
nature
of
the
reserves,
and
the
reserves
in
both
cases
are
based
upon
assumptions
and
methodologies,
and
that
is
the
relevant
point,
because
that
is
a
point
that
is
embedded
in
the
definition
of
the
term,
reserve
strengthening,
and
let
me
go
to
the
question,
if
i
may,
of
the
sentence,
because
backing
all
the
way
up--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--well,
in
fact...
that
is
correct,
but
in
fact
the
comparable...
when
they
make
that
change
in
the
property
casualty
area
that
is
the
normal
reserve
increase.
when
they
make
a
change
in
the
life
area,
the
normal
increase
is
the
adjustment
year
by
year
that
the
actuaries
have
built
in
for
additional
interest
assumptions
and
mortality
adjustments
and
so
on,
but
the--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--no,
justice
kennedy,
i
think
actually
i'm
disagreeing
with
that
point,
because
in
the
life
area
there
are
regular,
routine,
normal
reserve
changes
each
and
every
year,
increases
in
reserves,
adjustments
to
reserves.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
the
formula
for
determining
life
insurance
reserves
has
to
do
with
determining
the
present
value...
the
relationship
between
the
present
value
of
future
benefits
and
the
present
value
of
future
net
premiums,
and
those
things
really
adjust
every
year.
they
simply
have
normal
adjustments
every
year.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
exactly,
and
that's
the
very
important
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
that
there
is
a
fundamental
comparability
and
certainly
congress
was
aware
of
this,
because
i
want
to
go
back
to
justice
breyer's
question,
that
in
the
normal
adjustments
to
reserves,
things
that
happen
without
anything
extraordinary,
anything
untoward
or
mischievous,
potentially
mischievous,
and
adjustments
to
reserves
that
result
from
changes
in
methods
and
assumptions.
it's
the
latter
item
that
really
is
the
adjustment
item
that
can
produce
distortion,
and
i
think
both
in
the
context
of
1984
and
in
the
context
of
1986
the
well
known
reserve
strengthening
kind
of
standard
was
the
protection
that
congress
built
in
to
protect
against
distortion,
to
protect
against
anybody
taking
undue
advantage
of
the
fresh
start
rule.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
actually,
it's
easier
to
think
about
it
from
the
other
side,
justice
souter.
the
methodological
assumptions
happen
in
both
cases,
because
actuaries
determine
reserves
and
actuaries
determine
formulas
and
actuaries
change
formulas
and
assumptions.
on
the
property
casualty
side,
and
i'm
using
that
term
in
a...
not
an
attack
sense,
just
in
the
nature
of
that
business...
there
are
adjustments
to
reserves
that
result
every
year
in
a
normal
fashion
by
virtue
of
the
existing
formulas
and
existing
methods
that
are
used
to
determine
those
reserves.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
that--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--there
is
certainly
that
element,
but
that
is
just--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--no.
on
that
element
there
is
not.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
on
that
element
there
is
not,
but
that
is
just
one
element
of
a
determination
of
property
and
casualty
reserves.
in
this
case
the
petitioner
had
a
substantial
portion
of
its
reserves
determined
on
the
basis
of
the
formulas
and
methods
that
actuaries
had
in
place
for
determining
the
incurred
but
not
reported
losses
of
the
insurance
company
and
for
determining
loss
adjustment
expenses
of
the
insurance
company,
and
those
formulas
are
formulas
that...
there
are
many
possibilities
for
those
formulas,
but
the
actuaries
in
this
company
simply
selected
a
formula
and
a
method
to
apply,
and
it's
that
sort
of
formula
that
is...
that
was
susceptible
of
being
changed,
adjusted,
in
manipulating
the
fresh
start
rule.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
each
and
every
year,
life
insurance
reserves
increase
as
a
result...
probably
the
simplest
way
to
put
this,
of
the
insured
becoming
closer
to
death,
or--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--i
would
think
those...
the
kinds
that
do
not
reflect
implementations
of
previous
methodology
are
the
kind
that
involve
changes
in
methods
and
assumptions.
i
think--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--i'm
not
sure...
in
your
example,
you
simply
discovered
there
was
some...
i'm
sorry,
i
need
to--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--i
mean,
i
would
think
that
ultimately
that
may
require
a
change
in
methods
and
assumptions,
but
many
of
the
things,
underlying
facts
do
require
that--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--there--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--there
are
corrections
of
errors.
i
think
the
respondent
issued
a
ruling
in
1994
that
really
addressed
a
variety
of
things
that
distinguished
changes
in
methods
from
corrections
of
errors
and
other
types
of
adjustments,
but
i
think
there
is...
from
that
direction
there
is
clearly
some
distinction
between
the
normal
adjustments
in
property
and
casualty
and
normal
adjustments
in
life.
but
that
is
really
i
think
the
wrong
direction
to
be
looking
at
this
case
on,
because
i
think
if
you
assume
that
this
is...
this
being
the
reserve
strengthening
exclusion
from
the
fresh
start
benefit
that
congress
intended,
and
if
you
attribute
to
it
an
objective
to
prevent
mischievous,
artificial
things,
you
know
you've
accomplished
that,
i
think,
when
you
have
caught
people
who
have
adjusted
their
methods
and
assumptions.
i
think
frankly
that
is
what
congress
had
to
have
meant
when
it
used
the
term
that
it
was
well
aware
of.
i
think
you
always
have
to
keep
in
mind
here
that
the
respondent's
position
and
the
regulation
it
wrote
simply
took
the
words,
reserve
strengthening,
read
them
out
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
read
them
out
of
the
act
and
substituted
the
word,
all
increases.
it's--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--justice
ginsburg,
the
conference
report
has,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
the
identical
carve
out
from
the
fresh
start
rule.
reserve
strengthening
is
carved
out.
the
sentence
in
the
senate
report
that
respondent
has
pointed
out
that
justice
breyer
referred
to
had
nothing
whatever
to
do
with
the
definition
of
reserve
strengthening
in
a
general
way.
the
sentence
that
the
respondents
pointed
out
and
that
justice
breyer
referred
to
is
a
sentence
that
relates
specifically
to
the
treatment
of...
in
the
life
area,
which
is
the
comparable
sentence,
the
treatment
of
reserves
on
newly
issued
contracts.
it
in
no
way
was
intended
by
congress
to
infuse
the
term
reserve
strengthening
with
its
general,
historic,
longstanding
meaning.
and
in
fact
in
1984,
when
this
provision,
the
fresh
start,
the
carve
out
all
appeared
in
defra,
in
the
house
bill
there
was
no
comparable
sentence.
you
didn't
need
the
sentence
to
define
the
term,
reserve
strengthening--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--no,
justice
stevens.
that
is
exactly
the
term
it
used.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
yes,
precisely.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
no,
it
didn't
define
it.
there
was
a
sentence--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--yes.
the
life
insurance...
i'm
sorry.
the
life
insurance
statute
had
virtually
the
identical
provision,
an
exception
for
reserve
strengthening
from
the
fresh
start
rule.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
no,
it
did
not.
there
was
a
sentence
that
followed
it
that
addressed
the
treatment
of
reserves
on
contracts
issued
during
1984,
because
congress
was
concerned
that
there
was
some
reason
in
that
case
to
deal
with
people
who...
it
had
a
mid
year
effective
date,
the
1984
act,
and
there
was
some
reason
to
have
a
special
rule
to
identify--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--that
sentence
in
1984
was
consistent
with
the
notion
that
reserve
practices
were...
were...
changes
in
reserve
practices
involved
reserve
strengthening.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
yes.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
yes,
justice
stevens,
on
page--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--a-51
in
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
first
off,
it's
peculiar
because
it's
stated
as
a
negative
rule.
it
is
not
stated
as
if
one
were
expecting
a
definition
of
a
reserve
strengthening,
reserve
strengthening
is,
and
it's
not
stated
that
way
even
in
the
context
of
the
1984
context.
it
says,
reserve
strengthening
shall
not
include--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--reserves
on,
and
then
what
it
really
related
to
was
reserve
strengthening
at
the
end
of
1984,
that
that
was
consistent
with
practices
at
the
end
of
'83,
and
while
i
am...
i
can
point
to
evidence
that
the
sentence,
and
we
have
pointed
to
evidence
that
the
sentence
was
not
intended
to
define
reserve
strengthening,
there
really
is
no
actual
evidence
as
to
what
particular
case
congress
had
in
mind
under
that
rule,
but--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--well,
several
things
to
point
out.
the
house
bill
in
1984
did
not
have
the
sentence.
the
sentence
came
in,
i
believe,
in
the
senate
bill
with
a
view
to
accommodating
the
mid
year
effective
date
that
existed
for,
or
target
date,
announcement
date
for
the
change
in
1984,
and
what
the
sentence
i
think
had
to
do
with
was
a
need
to
provide
some
relief
for
some
actions
during
1984
that
would
have
been
captured
under
a
normal
definition
of
reserve
strengthening.
but
because
they
were
taken
and
then
adjusted
by
the
end
of
1984,
congress...
the
senate
first,
and
then
ultimately
the
whole
congress
was
providing
a
measure
of
relief
for
that
situation,
as
long
as
the
reserves
did
not
exceed
what
the
method...
what
reserves
on
the
same
method
would
have
produced--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--companies
could
take
those
actions
with
respect
to
contracts
and
enter
into
any
year
and,
indeed,
those
are
the
very
actions
that
are
prescribed
by
the
reserve
strengthening
rule.
i
think
there
must
have
been
a
unique
set
of
circumstances
that
existed
with
respect
to
particular
companies
and
particular
taxpayers
for
new
contracts
in
1984.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
congress
didn't
tell
you
what
it
was,
but
they
didn't
tell
you
in
the
house
bill
and
they
really
didn't...
in
1986,
when
they
got
rid
of
the
mid
year
effective
date,
in
effect,
the
trigger,
which
started
out
in
the
senate
bill
as
a
march...
reserve
strengthening
after
march
1,
and
the
final
conference
bill
modified
that
treatment.
it
was
going
to
be
effective
for
reserve
strengthening
during
calendar
year
1986,
and
when
they
did
that,
they
eliminated
the
sentence,
because
they
eliminated
the
need
to
respond
to
certain
actions
during
that
year.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
well,
it
provides
a
rule.
the
problem
is--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--pardon?
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
but
it
would--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--yes.
it
would...
you
would
apply
the
respondent's
interpretation
and,
i
believe,
frustrate
the
intent
of
congress,
because
you
would
have
cut
back
from
effective
date
at
the
end
of
1986
to
effective
date
at
the
end
of
1985--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--i
think--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--i
do
not
quarrel
with
that.
i
think
that
is
the
same
standard
that
the
third
circuit
applied.
i
think
the
third
circuit
erred
because
it
simply
failed
to
give
proper
credit
to
the
plain
meaning
of
the
term,
reserve
strengthening,
and
failed
to--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--you
would,
except
you
would
have...
you
would
have
eliminated
from
the
fresh
start
relief
in
the
life
area
the
vast...
the
overwhelming
majority
of
reserve
increases
that
were
protected
and
intended
to
be
the
beneficiary
of
the
fresh
start
relief,
because
you
would
have
captured,
as
we
were
discussing
earlier,
all
the
increases,
all
the
ordinary
increases
in
life
reserves.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
no,
i--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--all
of
the
increases...
life
reserves,
as
i
suggested
earlier,
grow
each
and
every
year
by
virtue
of
the
formulas
that
are
in
place.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
in
answering
justice
stevens'
question,
if
i
apply
the
respondent's
rule
to
the
life
area,
all
those
ordinary
increases,
all
of
them
would
have
been
denied
and
separated--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--from
the
fresh
start.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
that
rule,
justice
stevens,
only
applies
to
newly
issued
contracts,
the
contracts
issued
during
1984.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
the
word
issued
appears
in
the...
in
the
statute
as
it
is
written.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
the
senate
report,
the
senate
bill
which
first
contained
that
sentence--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--it
would
if
you
read
the
word...
if
you
read
the
word
issued
out
of
the
statute.
the
word
issued
is...
congress
simply
wouldn't
have
used
the
word
issued.
it
doesn't
add
anything
to
the
equation.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
you
do
not,
but
you
have
reserves--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--that
is
certainly
correct,
justice
stevens.
however,
we
know
from
the
title
to
that
sentence
that
when
it
was
added
in
the
senate
report,
that
it
was
intended
to
covered
newly
issued
contracts,
because
it
said,
reserves
on
newly
issued
contracts.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
issued
during
the
calendar
year
1984.
that
is
exactly
what
the--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--i'm
sorry,
1983.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
i
do
not
think
they
agree
with
that
interpretation.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
i'm
sorry?
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
i...
in
their
brief
they
cited
that
without
the
word
issued
in
there,
so
i
think
maybe
they
don't.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
i
think
when
i
answered
justice
o'connor's
question
i
was
really
answering
in
the
broad
sense
that
at
least
in
the
past
5
or
6
years
most
courts
interpreting...
many
courts
interpreting
tax
regulations
have,
indeed,
applied
the
chevron
standard.
if
the
intent
in
congress
is
clear,
they--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--i
think
even
the
tax
court--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--the
tax
court--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
--well,
they're
a
court.
they're
not
an
agency
or
a,
you
know,
agency
making...
rulemaking
enterprise.
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
justice
stevens,
you
wouldn't
need
it
in
the
ordinary
course.
you
didn't
have
it
in
the
ordinary
course.
you
didn't
have
it
in
the
house
bill
and
i
think
the
only
explanation
i
can
give
is
that
it
appears
that
it
is
responsive
to
a
set
of
circumstances
where
there
were
changes
made
during
1983
by
a
particular
taxpayers
and
congress...
they
still
let
them
have
their
relief
as
long
as
their
reserves
at
the
end
of
1983
were
the
same
as
they
were
at
the
end
of
1982.
i
would
simply
suggest
that
when
you
state
a
sentence...
it
would
be
extraordinary
for
congress
to
state
a
sentence
in
the
negative
if
that
was
their
intended
positive
rule.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder--
mr.
george
r.
abramowitz
it
would
not
have
been
unreasonable
for
congress
to
have
not
provided
the
reserve
strength...
the
fresh
start
rule.
but
congress
did
provide
the
fresh
start
rule.
it
is
unreasonable
for
this
agency,
the
internal
revenue
service,
to
have
cut
back
that
rule
in
a
way
that
frustrated
the
intent
of
congress.
in
effect,
what
this
regulation
does
is
make
reserves
at
the
end
of
1985
subject
to
the
fresh
start
and
not
reserves
at
the
end
of
1986.
the
congress
had
a
very
specific
purpose
in
providing
the
reserve
strengthening
exception,
whatever
their
purpose
was
for
the
broad
relief
they
were
providing,
and
that
very
specific
purpose
that
it
had
had
to
do
with
artificial,
manipulative
advantage
taking
of
the
fresh
start
rule
that
they
were
providing.
the
historic
definition
of
reserve
strengthening,
the
historic
meaning
of
that
term
satisfied
that
congressional
objective.
contrary
to
what
respondent
counsel
just
indicated,
there
was
a
30-year
history
of
the
term
reserve
strengthening
that
began...
it
first
appears
in
the
legislative
history
for
the
1959
act
for
life
insurance
companies.
it
is
in
judicial
decisions,
it
is
in
regulations,
it
is
in
revenue
rulings
for
30
years
before
congress
had...
had
it...
actually
had
applied
it
in
the
1984
act.
now,
it
didn't
really
have
much
reason
to
be
in
the
statute
before
then
because
generally
adjustments
go
two
directions
when
you
change
methods
or
assumptions.
they
can
reserve
increases
or
reserve
decreases.
one
is
strengthening,
one
is
weakening,
so
generally
when
you
saw
this
in
the
statute
from
the
'59
act
it
was
referred
to
as
changes
in
basis,
which
went
both
directions.
but
when
they
needed
the
rule
that
they
adopted
in
1984,
they
looked
to
a
term
of
art
that
they
understood,
this
term
that
they
understood
and
that
the
internal
revenue
service
understood.
in
commissioner
v.
keystone,
consolidated
industries,
this
court,
at
respondent's
suggestion,
identified
the
term,
sale
or
exchange,
as
a
term
of
art
in
tax
law.
it
is
true
that
reserve
strengthening
doesn't
quite
go
to
the
breadth
of
the
term,
sale
or
exchange.
by
the
same
token,
for
insurance
tax
lawyers
and
insurance
taxation
the
term
reserve
strengthening
has
a
very
precise
meaning.
that
is
the
meaning
that
congress
intended.
to
the
extent
that
senator
wallop
indicated
he
had
some
concern
about
changes
in
that
meaning,
those
concerns
were
reflected
in
his
comments
sometime
after
the
act,
but
the
more
important
point
is,
he
expressed
some
concern
that
he
certainly
didn't
recollect
any
changes
in
definition
that
occurred
or
were
discussed
by
the
conferees.
