but
isn't
that
a
disputed
point?
i
mean,
the
government
tells
us
it
didn't,
and
said
we
have
witnesses
to
say
it
didn't
have.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
what
we're
talking
about
here,
and
they
had
two
witnesses
to
say
in
property
and
casualty,
at
least,
the
meaning
is
not
a
term
of
art.
there
are
multiple
meanings.
so--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i'm
just
bringing
that
up
to
say
that
it
isn't...
can't
be
clear
that
it
is
a
term
of
art
in
the
kind
of
insurance
we're
talking
about.

mr.
abramowitz,
if
we
could
go
back
to
the
second
part
of
justice
breyer's
question,
that
is,
if
one
looked
only
at
that
senate
report
one
would
say,
you
win,
but
the
conference
report
seems
to
be
much
more
inclusive
than
what
you
are
now
describing
to
us.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that
was
a
pre
chevron
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
it's
been
working
okay
in
the
tax
area.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
academic
writers
have
said
it's
chevron
minus.
