justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
thought
there
was
a
big
difference.
i
thought
the
difference
with
life
insurance
is,
if
i
sell
a
policy
today
and
i
take
the
income
in
and
i'm
going
to
have
to
pay
it
out
in
30
years,
i
use
a
bunch
of
statistical
tables
that
tell
me
people's
life
expectancy.
if
i'm
in
the
casualty
business,
at
the
end
of
the
year
in
which
i've
received
the
premium
i
have
to
make
what
i'd
call
an
educated
guess
about
how
many
tornadoes...
there
were
some
tornadoes,
but
i
mean,
how
many
houses
actually
were
flattened
and
how
many
people
are
out
there
with
television
sets
that
they
haven't
put
their
property
claim
in
yet,
and
there
aren't
some
tables
i
can
go
to.
i
thought
people
sit
there
and
they
make
educated
guesses
about
to
what
extent
the
policy
that
was
sold
in
year
one
is
going
to
result
in
a
claim
for
that
year
that
i'll
have
to
pay
out
in
year
10.
i
thought
that's
quite
a
big
difference,
so
that
seemed
to
me
difference
one,
and
difference
two
is
that
you
had
a
sentence
in
the
bill
that
would...
they
have
a
sentence
in
the
bill
that
says,
in
the
life
insurance
case,
you
know,
strengthening
is...
does
not...
you
know
the
sentence
i'm
referring
to.
it's
right
there.
it
wins
your
case
if
you
were
in
the
life
insurance,
and
it's
gone
in
your
case,
and
they
put
it
in
in
the
senate
in
your
bill,
and
the
house
took
it
out.
so
there
we
are.
we
have
a
difference
in
practice,
we
have
a
difference
in
language
in
the
bill,
and
we
have
a
difference
in
the
legislative
history
where
you
won
your
battle
in
the
senate
and
you
lost
it
in
the
house.
now,
given
that,
how
do
you
win
the
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
isn't
this
the
case,
that
suppose
i
have
an
insurance
company
and
i
insure
people
in
jacksonville,
florida,
for
life
insurance,
and
through
some
kind
of
total
fluke
a
terrible
disease
breaks
out,
unpredictable,
in
florida,
not
elsewhere.
then
i
guess
i
could
discover
that
through
that
fluke
of
happenstance
my
reserves
were
understated,
and
i
guess
that's
an
example
where
you
might
need
to
strengthen
reserves
in
life
insurance
without
changing
methodology.
am
i
right?
i'm
testing
out
my
understanding
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
suddenly
you
happen
to
be
in
a
city
where
your
insurance
company
is,
and
suddenly
a
lot
more
people
died
there
than
you'd
think.
they
have...
they
discover
some
genetic
feature.
they
discover
some
kind
of
a
disease
that
breaks...
forget
it.
it's
not
important.
you
don't
have
to
answer.
i
just--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--okay.
you're
saying
in
life
insurance
it
always
requires
changes
in
methods
and
assumptions,
and
in
casualty
it
doesn't,
and
therefore--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
probably
your
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
is...
just
to
go
back
to
your
general
point,
as
a
tax
lawyer,
i'm
curious...
you
are,
i'm
not,
but
the...
is
it
proper
to
give
chevron
deference
to
the
irs?
if
that's
right,
what
do
we
do...
do
we
give
chevron
deference
to
the
tax
court?
does
the
tax
court
give
chevron
deference
to
the
irs?
why
do
we
have
a
tax
court,
then?
i
mean,
i'm
worried
about
this
conceptual
point.
i'd
like
to
get
it
right,
and
i'm
not
certain
what
the
answer
is,
and
it
has
much
more
implication
that
this
case,
and
i
just
wondered
what
the
tax
court,
which
i
guess
was
the
board
of
tax
appeals,
what
their
role
is
in
all
this
if
suddenly
total
chevron
authority
is
being
given
to
the
irs.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
i
just
think
that
has
quite
a
lot
of
implication
and
i
don't
know
what
the
right
answer
to
that
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
the
tax
court
just
defers
to
the
irs?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--it's
a
variation
of
skidmore,
possibly.
you
said
we
give
them
the
deference
that
they're
due
in
light
of
their
power
to
persuade.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
don't
know
if
you
can
correct
my
problem
with
the
double
deduction.
i
couldn't
quite
understand
it.
the
reason
i
couldn't
understand
it
when
i
looked
at
your
example
was,
i
understood
the
idea
of
a
person
having
a
reserve,
and
they
then
discounted
it,
wrote
it
down
from
$10
to
$9,
and
normally
that
would
mean
you
have
to
take
a
dollar
into
income,
but
congress
forgave
that.
then
time
passes,
and
2
years
go
by,
and
at
that
point
they
pay
the
loss
of
$10,
in
which
case
they
deduct
that,
and
then
they...
they've
increased
their
reserve
by
the
9,
so
you
say,
a
ha,
it's
9,
not
10.
it
doesn't
offset.
but
it
should
have
grown
to
10,
so
i
mean,
the
whole
point
of
the
discount
was
that...
was--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--why
doesn't
it
grow
to
10,
and
maybe
it's
not
worth
going
into.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
property
and
casualty
reserves,
you
didn't...
didn't
they
discount
it,
because
they
wanted
to
have
an
amount
here
in
year
one
such
that
it
would
grow
to
the
point
where
it
equaled
the
amount
that
they'd
have
to
pay
out
in
year
three?
wasn't
that
the
whole
purpose
of
discounting?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
that
was,
why
didn't
it
grow?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
reserve
strengthening.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
just
trying
to
figure
out
this
problem
of
what
you
call
the
double
deduction
in
your
example
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--don't
bother
if
it's
too
complicated.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
then,
by
the
time
you
got
to
pay
it
out
the
reserves
should
have
equaled
10,
not
9.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
ah,
because...
because
you
mean,
you
took
it
a
little...
as
it
was
growing
each
year.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
okay.
i
understand.
thank
you.
