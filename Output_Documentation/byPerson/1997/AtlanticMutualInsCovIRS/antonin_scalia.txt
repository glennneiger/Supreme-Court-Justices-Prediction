the
formula's
not
the
problem.
that's
right,
yes.
i'm
still
waiting
to
hear
what
nonformula
factors
exist
in
the
life
insurance
area.
justice

what
was
that--
--which
sentence
made
it
clear
that
reserve
strengthening
meant
what
you
say
it
means.
that
sentence
made
that
clear.
your
position
is
simply
that
the
purpose
of
the
sentence
was
not
to
make
it
clear.
the
purpose
of
the
sentence
was
not
to
define
it,
but
you
don't
deny
that
the
sentence,
whatever
it
was
meant
to
do
as
a
practical
matter,
makes
it
clear
what
reserve
strengthening
meant?
justice

scalia
changes
in
methodology.
justice
antonin
scalia
no--
--you
say
there
aren't
any.
they're
all
methodological
increases.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
the
life
area
you
haven't
given
us
any
that
would
not
come
under
the
narrow
meaning
of
reserve
strengthening
that
you
argue
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
they
wouldn't,
because
of
the
proviso
that
follows
right
after.
it
says,
it
shall
not
apply
if
such
computation
employs
the
reserve
practice
used
in
the
past.
justice

issued

i

justice

mr.
jones,
could
you
tell
me,
the
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
about
this
is
what
is
the
evil
that
the
statute
is
directed
at
on
your
interpretation
of
it?
i
mean,
i
can
see
that
it's
an
evil
if
you're...
you
know,
if
you're
playing
games
with
the
methodology
and
the
government
wants
to
come
down
on
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you're
just
taking
account
of
verifiable
real
life
occurrences,
what...
why
would
the
government
not
want
that
to
be
taken
into
account?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
like
that
other
test
better.
justice
antonin
scalia
any
other
agencies
we
should
treat
specially?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
have
sort
of
a
super
chevron--
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
this
is
all
gravy,
so
taking
away
any
of
it
can't
possibly
be
unreasonable.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
in
a
way,
if
you
didn't
do
that
you
are
effectively
changing
your
methodology
anyhow,
aren't
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
have
that
reserve
for
that
very
purpose
and
you
don't
use
it
for
that
purpose.
