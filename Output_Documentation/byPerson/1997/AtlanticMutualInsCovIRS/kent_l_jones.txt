mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
term
reserve
strengthening
has
no
plain
and
obvious
meaning.
it
is
not
defined
in
any
dictionary
or
in
any
statute.
it
lacks
a
consistent
industry
usage.
the
scope
and
meaning
of
the
term
depends
upon
its
context,
and
in
the
context
of
the
tax
reform
act
of
1986
it
is
manifest
that
congress
consciously
employed
the
term
in
its
broadest
sense
to
encompass
any
and
all
increases
to
existing
reserves
made
during
that
year,
the
year
that
that
act
was
pending
before
congress.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
absolutely
right.
reserves
can...
the
dollar
amount
of
reserves
can
change
without
us
knowing,
in
the
abstract,
whether
that
strengthened
or
weakened
the
reserves.
the
conference
committee
made
that
point.
it's
quoted
at
page
14
of
our
brief.
it
says,
in
describing
the
types
of
additions
to
the
reserves
that
the
reserve
strengthening
provision
in
the
'86
act
covers,
the
first
example
that
it
gives
is
an
increase
in
an
estimate
of
a
reserve
and
then
it
says,
paren,
taking
into
account
the
amount
of
claims
paid
you
have
to
take
into
account
the
amount
of
claims
paid
to
know
whether
the
reserve
has
been
increased
or
strengthened.
you
might
know
whether
it
had
been
increased,
but
you
wouldn't
know
whether
it's
been
strengthened.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
wouldn't
want
to
use
the
word
evil.
the
problem
that
the
statute
addresses
is
a
problem
that
congress
created
in
the
'86
act.
in
the
'86
act,
congress
did
something
very
uncharacteristic.
they
gave
property
and
casualty
insurance
companies
a
double
deduction.
that's
extraordinary
in
the
tax
law.
it's
extremely
generous.
the
only
function
of
the
reserve
strengthening
clause
is
never
to
deny
a
deduction.
it
is
only
to
limit
the
scope
of
this
uncharacteristic
double
deduction.
what
congress
did
in
1986
was
to
say,
well,
you
can
have
a
double
deduction
for
a
portion
of
your
insurance
reserves,
but
we're
not
going
to
let
you
increase
that
double
deduction
by
increasing
your
reserves
in
1986,
the
year
that
this
bill
was
pending.
as
judge
halperin
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
the
western
mutual
case,
what
is
anomalous
about
this
statute
is
not
the
broad
mechanical
rule
that
congress
plainly
intended
to
apply
to
reserve
strengthening.
what
was
anomalous
was
that
congress
allowed
a
double
deduction
in
the
first
place,
and
that
the
breadth
of
the
mechanical
rule
that
congress
adopted
for
reserve
strengthening
is
simply
designed
to
reduce
that
anomaly
that
they
created
by
permitting
a
double
deduction
in
the
first
place.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
have
taken
a
position
in
this
case
that
this
is
an
interpretive
regulation.
the
standard
that
this
court
has
applied
for
interpretive
treasury
regulations
is
set
out
in
its
opinions
in
the
national
muffler
dealers
case
and
united
states
v.
correll,
and
that
is
that
interpretive
regulation
must
be
sustained
if
it
is
not
plainly
inconsistent
with
the
statute
and
is
not
unreasonable
in
light
of
what
congress
sought
to
do.
we--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absolutely,
and
i'm...
i'm
not
familiar
of
a
reason
why
you
shouldn't
cite
chevron
on
this
case.
i'm
just
pointing
out
that
you
have--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you
have
long
applied
another
test,
and
i
think
that
other
test
has...
even
if
it
has
a
different
emphasis
it
has
the
same
conclusion,
but
i
think
that
there
is
a
particular
practical
side
to
the
national
muffler
dealers
and
correll
test.
and
the
practical
side
is
that
this
agency
really
does
make
a
careful
study
not
only
of
the
statute
and
the
history
of
this
provision
but
of
the
complicated
surrounding
and
related
provisions,
and
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
the
agency
is
the
master
of
the
rules
and
it's
appropriate
to
give
it
special
deference
to
recognize
the
function
that
it
serves
and
to
provide
certainty.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i'm
not
representing
any
other--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
really
think
it's
a
super
chevron.
i
think
it's
a
practical
approach
to
the
deference
question.
i
think
the
court
takes
a
practical
approach
to
treasury
regulations
and
realizes
that
this
agency
is
entitled
to
special
deference
because
of
its
extraordinary
intricacy
of
the
details,
and
this
case
i
think
may
well
be
a
prime
example
of
that.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well...
okay.
i
think
the
deference
that's
due
is
in
light
of
the
subject
matter,
i
frankly
do,
and
i
wouldn't
want
to
call
it
a
super
chevron
deference.
i
just
think
it's
an
application
of
the
same
principle
in
this
specific
context.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
i
think
you
could
argue
either
side
of
it,
and
i
certainly
don't
think
it's
been
applied
as
a
chevron
minus.
i
don't
think
the
words
are
stronger,
but
i
think
the
application
of
it
is
at
least
as
strong
as
chevron.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
you
can
get
the
meaning
of
the
statute
by
the
ordinary
application
of
interpretive
principles
that
the
court
applies.
the
text
of
the
regulation
makes
clear
the
broad
intent
simply
by
the
fact
that
the
court's
already
discussed,
which
is
that
the
senate
version
of
the
bill
had
enclosed...
included
a
limiting
clause
that
would
have
made
it
applicable
only
to
changes
in
reserves
due
to
changes
in
methodologies.
that
provision
from
the
senate
bill
was,
of
course,
derived
from
the
'84
reserve
strengthening
provision
that
had
applied
that
same
language
in
describing
the
transitional
rule
for
life
insurance
provisions.
congress
rejected
that,
took
that
provision
out,
and
explained
why
they
did
so
in
the
conference
committee
report
and
also
senator
wallop
acknowledged
the
same
thing.
congress
wanted
a
broad
prophylactic
cook
book,
mechanical
rule
to
prevent
any
increases
in
existing
reserves
to
be
added
to
the
double
deduction
that
was
otherwise
permitted.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
the
'84
act
governs
the
life
insurance
reserve
strengthening
provision,
and
it
is
limited
to
changes
in
reserves
caused
by
changes
in
the
reserve
methodologies.
the
'86
act,
as
congress
could
not
have
been
more
clear
than
stating
in
the
conference
report,
and
as
the
changes
in
the
text
also
show,
was
designed
to
be
much
broader.
it
was
designed
to
cover
three
categories
that
the
conference
committee
report
discusses,
changes
in
estimates
of
a
particular
reserve,
changes
in
reserve
methodology
like
in
the
'84
area,
and
then
to
make
the
breadth
of
its
intent
perfectly
clear
said,
any
other
unspecified
or
unallocated
additions
to
reserves.
so
yes,
there
would
be
a
different
application
of
the
property
and
casualty
reserve
strengthening
provision
in
the
'86
act
than
the
prior
provision
for
life--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--for
the
eighty...
in...
no
reserve
strengthening
in
'86,
no
reserve
increases
for
existing
reserves
get
the
double
deduction
under
the
'86
act.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
don't...
i
don't
follow
the
question.
we
haven't
changed
our
characterization
of
the
statutes.
i
think
i
know
what
you're
referring
to.
petitioner
says
in
its
reply
brief
that
we've
changed
our
pitch,
if
you
will,
about
whether
there
had
been
a
prior
usage
in
the
life
insurance
industry,
about
what
in
the
life
insurance
industry
reserve
strengthening
was
used.
that's
a
misrepresentation
of
our
position.
what
we
have
done
in
our
brief
is
respond
to
a
new
argument
that
petitioner
is
making.
in
the
courts
below,
petitioner
relied
on
the
proposition
that
industry
usage
showed
the
plain
meaning
of
the
term,
but
the
record
in
this
case
and
its
own
witnesses
don't
support
that.
its
own
witnesses
acknowledge
there
are
many
different
uses
of
the
term
and
there
is
no
well
defined
application
of
reserve
strengthening
in
the
property
and
casualty
industry,
so
petitioner
has
abandoned
the
position
about
what
industry
usage
means.
what
they
argue
here
is
that
reserve
strengthening
is
what
they
call
a
tax
term.
it
has
a
tax
meaning
that
somehow
exists
wholly
apart
from
industry
usage
and
apart
from
legislative
intent.
there
isn't
such
a
thing
as
a
tax
term
of
that
ilk.
there
are
some
tax
terms
like
capital
gains
and
ordinary
and
necessary
business
expenses
that
have
distinctive
meanings.
reserve
strengthening
is
an
industry
term.
it
draws
its
meaning
from
industry
usage.
the
industry
usage
is
mixed
and
depends
on
context
and
in
the
context
of
the
'86
act
congress
meant
to
give
it
its
broadest
scope.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
we
have
interpreted
the
term
the
same
way,
but
what
i
thought
you
were
asking
me
about
was,
do
we
accept
that
in
the
life
insurance
industry
usage,
not
this
tax
term
of
art
idea,
but
that
there
was
an
industry
usage
in
life
insurance
to
refer
to
reserve
strengthening
as
meaning
a
change
in
reserve
methodology.
we
don't
dispute
that.
what
we
have
always
disputed
is
that
no
such
industry
usage
applies
to
property
and
casualty
insurance,
that
the
term
has
different
meanings
and
different
contexts,
and
that's
what
the
witnesses
in
this
case
acknowledged,
and
that's
certainly
what
the
conference
committee
report
of
this
legislation
indicates.
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
only--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
it's
only
been
used
twice,
so
it's
easy
to
answer
that
question.
it
doesn't
appear
anywhere
in
the
internal
revenue
code.
the
only
two
times
where
this
term
has
been
used
is
in
the
'84
transitional
rule
and
in
the
'86
transitional
rule,
and
in
the
'84
rule
it
was
confined
by
this
phrase
about
it
doesn't
apply
unless
you've
changed
your
methodology,
and
in
the
'86
rule
that
phrase
was
deleted.
so
the
term
has
been
used
by
congress
with
the
same
meaning
in
both
places.
it's
just
that
in
the
'84
act
they
limit
it
with
the
additional
language
that
they
didn't
use
in
'86.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
may
be
that
that's
the
effect
of
the
proviso.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
i
don't
think
that
was
the
object
of
it.
i
mean,
you
can't
look
at
the
proviso
and
say...
if
you
look
at
the
proviso
in
'84
and
you
think
that
reserve
strengthening
means
what
petitioner
says,
well,
you
don't
need
the
proviso.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
so
it
must
have
meant...
if
you
will,
it
must
have
meant
something
more,
and
what...
it
certainly
can
mean
more,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
certainly
capable
of
meaning
more,
and
in
the
'86
act,
clearly
congress
wanted
it
to
mean
more
to
prevent
this
double
deduction
from
being
expanded
beyond
what
they
were
willing
to
tolerate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
doesn't.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
you
may
be
thinking
of
life
reserves
instead
of
property
and
casualty
reserves.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
reserve
strengthening
rule
doesn't
cover
30--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
all
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it
is
too
complicated,
but
let
me
try.
[laughter]
the
double
deduction
will
accrete
this
additional
dollar
of
deduction
over
the
period
that
the
claim
remains
outstanding
and
unpaid,
so
if
you've
got...
if
you've
brought
it
back
to
present
value
over
10
years
you
will
accrete
a
portion
of
that
over
that
10-year--each
of
that
10-year
period,
so
you
get
the
double
deduction
as
time
goes
by.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
then
you've
fully
gotten
the
double
deduction
over
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
only
other
point
i
think
i
need
to
address
is
the
suggestion
that
the
mechanical
rule
reaches
absurd
or
anomalous
results.
that
argument's
wrong
for
three
reasons.
the
first
is,
what
the
regulation
does
is
exactly
what
congress
wanted
to
be
done.
it
can't
be
unreasonable
for
the
agency
to
have
adopted
a
rule
that
is
precisely
in
conformance
with
what
the
conference
committee
explained
reserve
strengthening
was
supposed
to
mean.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
that's...
well,
i
think
that's
exactly
right.
that
is
exactly
right.
it
is
not
unreasonable...
it
would
not
have
been
unreasonable
for
congress
to
have
allowed
1
penny
of
double
deduction.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no.
if
you
had
an
existing
policy...
let's
say
in
1986
you
discovered
a
claim
came
up
under
a
1982
year.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
would
that
cause
reserve
strengthening
in
'86,
and
the
answer
is,
i
don't
know.
the
answer...
the
reason
i
don't
know
is
because
you've
got
this
account
called
reserve
for
claims
incurred
but
not
reported,
and
so
you
might
simply
transfer
a
portion
of
that
reserve
into
a
case
reserve
for
this
claim
that
you
have
now
discovered
that
has
now
been
reported,
and
if
that's
what
happened,
then
there's
been
no
reserve
strengthening
in
'86.
it
might
be
that
you
didn't
do
that.
you
just
created
a
new
case
reserve.
there
was
no
corresponding
reduction
in
the
reserve
for
claims
incurred
but
not
reported,
and
yes,
that
would
be
reserve
strengthening.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that's...
you
could
look
at
it
that
way,
but
i
think
frankly
that
the
whole
concept
of
reserve
methodologies
doesn't
fit
comfortably
with
property
and
casualty
insurance,
because
property
and
casualty
insurance
look
backwards.
they
are
an
effort
to
estimate
an
indeterminate
amount
of
damages
for
something
that's
already
happened.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
because
it's...
a
judgment
is
involved.
when
the...
in
the
property
and
casualty
area,
when
they
set
up
the
new
account--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
don't
think
i
can
answer
it
better
than
i
tried
to
the
first
time.
it
depends
on
how
you
create
the
reserve.
if
you
create
the
reserve
by
saying,
well,
i've
always
had
this
account
for
claims
incurred
but
not
reported,
and
you
use...
take
$10
out
of
that
and
create
a
case
reserve
for
$10,
it's
a
wash.
it's
not
a
reserve
strengthening.
you...
insurance
companies
know
today
that
they're
going
to
get
claims
coming
along
over
a
goodsized
period
of
years,
even
though
the
claims
have
already
been
incurred,
they
haven't
been
reported,
and
so
they
provide
for
that
with
a
separate
reserve
for
that
kind
of
a
claim,
that
situation.
and
as
we
tried
to
describe
in
our
brief,
the
problem
with
the
factual
hypotheticals
that
petitioner
gives
us
is,
they
don't
give
any
consideration
to
that
aspect
of
reserves,
and
they're
based
upon
what
i
think
is
fairly
described
as
a
frivolous
suggestion
that
insurance
companies
have
only
two
or
three
claims
a
year.
we're
supposed
to
look
to
the
broad
company
wide
data
to
decide
whether
reserve
strengthening
happened
under
the...
under
the
regulation.
the
regulation
is
designed
to
let
the...
or
the
statute
is
designed
to
let
these
insurance
companies
have
their
cake
and
eat
it
too.
it's
a
double
deduction,
but
it's
not
as
big
a
double
deduction
as
they'd
like.
it's
not
as
big
a
double
deduction
as
congress
plainly
wanted...
was
willing
to
give
them.
all
the
