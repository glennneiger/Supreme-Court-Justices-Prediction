well,
what
are
the
differences
in
reserve
accounting
between
the
life
insurance
and
the
property
and
casualty
insurance
businesses?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
abramowitz,
if
we
apply
the
treasury
regulation
at
issue
here,
does
it
answer
the
question
of
how
we
deal
with
this
in
the
property
and
casualty
context?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
it
would
answer
the
question--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
we
apply
the
regulation,
i
assume.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
deference
do
we
owe
in
the
income
tax
context
to
a
treasury
regulation?
is
it
an
ordinary
chevron
deference?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
do
not
quarrel
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
kind
of
deference
do
you
think
we
owe
to
a
regulation
of
this
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
we
get
the
meaning
of
reserve
strengthening
from
the
statute
alone?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or
do
we
have
to
look
at
that
regulation
to
know
what
it
means?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
if
your
position
is
the
right
one
here,
what
differences
are
there
at
bottom
between
the
life
insurance
reserve
strengthening
and
the
property
and
casualty
reserve
strengthening?
