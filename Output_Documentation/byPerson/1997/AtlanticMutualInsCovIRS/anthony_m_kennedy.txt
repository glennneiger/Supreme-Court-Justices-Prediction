justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that's
very
important,
and
i
think
we
should
stay
with
the
format
of
justice
breyer's
question,
but
just
taking
the
first
part
of
his
question
to
help
us
to
understand
these
things,
isn't
it
true
that
in
the
life
area
reserves
are
usually
changed
because
of
methodologies
and
in
the
casualty
area
because
of
empirical
reports
that
there
have
been...
that
there
have
been
losses
and
so
forth?
in
the
life
area,
people
don't
say,
oh,
you
know,
this
policyholder
has
just
been
diagnosed
with
cancer,
we're
going
to
change
the
risk.
they
don't
do
that.
but
in
the
casualty
area,
i
take
it
they
do.
now,
tell
me
if
that's
wrong,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
that,
as
a
general
matter,
reserve
changes...
other
than
for
the
addition
of
new
policies
reserve
changes
are
made
in
the
life
area
because
of
methodology
changes
and
in
the
casualty
area
because
of
empirical
assessments
about
actual
losses.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
for
what
reasons?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
those
are
different
than
methodology
changes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
government
agree
with
that?
newly
means
what?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
the
government
agree
with
that
interpretation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm...
as
to
the
contracts
to
which
it's
applicable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
as
to
the
insurance
contracts
to
which
it's
applicable.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
i
take
it
there's
a
reason
under
your
theory
of
the
case
that
congress
used
the
term
strengthen
rather
than
increase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
i...
tell
me
if
this
is
right.
it
might
not
be
right.
if
it
had
used
the
word
increase,
then
that
wouldn't
have
done
the
trick,
because
then
any
reduction
for
actual
loss
payments
would
have
absorbed
some
real
increases.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now,
you
changed
your
position
on
the
equivalence
of
the
statutes
in
your
brief
to
this
court
or
the
lower
court,
or
is
that
a
mischaracterization?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
you
have
always
interpreted
the
term
to
mean
the
same
in
the
'84
and
the
'86
act,
subject,
of
course,
to
the
fact
that
there's
a
qualification
in
the
'84
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
let
me
just
do
it
one
more
time.
you
have
always
taken
the
position
that
the
term,
reserve
strengthening,
means
the
same
in
each
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
subject,
of
course,
to
this
special
clause
that's
in
the
'84
act.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
your
view,
if
there's
an
old
policy
and
an
old
loss
in
the
casualty
area,
and
it's
just
discovered,
can
you
increase
the
reserve
for
that
without
strengthening
the
reserve?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
if
that's
so
and
we
go
strictly
on
an
empirical
basis,
then
it
seems
to
me
there
ought
to
be
an
answer
to
my
question
one
way
or
the
other.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
judgment
is,
we
found
the
old
loss,
we
didn't
know
about
it,
it
hasn't
been
included
in
our
account,
we're
going
to
add
it.
is
that
strengthening?
