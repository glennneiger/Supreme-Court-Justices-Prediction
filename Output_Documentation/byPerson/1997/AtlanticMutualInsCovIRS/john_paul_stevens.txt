justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
am
i
correct...
i
just
want
to
be
sure
about
my
memory.
is
it
not
correct
that
the
1984
statute
didn't
use
the
term
reserve
strengthening?
justice
john
paul
stevens
pardon
me
again?
does
it
use
the
term,
reserve
strengthening--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
1984
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
defined
it
as
a
change
in
methodology?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i've
got
the
statutes...
the
life
insurance
statute.
that's
the
1984--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
did
it
define
the
term,
reserve
strengthening?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
those
provisions
of
the
1984
statute
quoted
in
any
of
the
papers
before
us?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
a-51?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i...
have
you
finished
your
answer
to
justice
o'connor?
i
want
to
ask
you
this
question,
looking
at
the
statute.
i
fumbled
it
a
little
bit
before.
what
if
one
read
the
words
reserve
strengthening
in
the
life
insurance
statute
to
have
exactly
the
same
meaning
that
the
government
says
they
have
in
the
property
casualty
insurance
and
then
reads
the
subparagraph
saying,
but
we're
taking
out
of
that
broader
definition
those
that
do
not
involve
a
change
in
methodology.
isn't
that
the
way...
then
the
two...
reserve
strengthening
would
have
the
same
meaning
in
both
statutes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
doesn't
limit
it
to
'84,
does
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
any
contract
issued.
it
doesn't
say
issued
in
1984.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
stick
with
the
text
for
a
minute.
let
me
be
a
justice
scalia
for
a
minute
and
just
work
with
the
text
and
nothing
else
for
a
second.
[laughter]
if
you
have
the
text,
why
doesn't
that
completely
protect
all
changes
that
result
from
changes
in
methodology,
because
it
excludes
those
that
employ
the
same
reserve
practice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
have
reserves
on
anything
except
issued
contracts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
all
reserves
are
reserves
on
contracts
that
have
been
issued.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--let
me
just
ask
one
more
question.
if
you're...
if
you
are
correct
that
reserve
strengthening
has
well
settled
meaning
in
the
industry
and
in
the
statute,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
proviso
is
unnecessary,
the
clause-2-shall-not-apply
language.
in
other
words,
it
says
clause
2
shall
not
apply
if
the
computation
was
the
same.
you
wouldn't
need
that
proviso
if
reserve
strengthening
had
the
clear
settled
meaning
that
you
say
it
had.
