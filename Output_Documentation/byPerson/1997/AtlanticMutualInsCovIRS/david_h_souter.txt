justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
the
plausibility
of
what
you
say
about
the
comparability
of
the
way
adjustments
are
made
depends,
i
guess,
on
understanding
the
kinds
of
nonmethodological
adjustments
that
are
made
in
the
life
insurance
area
and
you
gave
that
rather
a
quick
treatment,
as
if
we
understood,
and
i
don't.
could
you
explain
some
of
those
nonmethodological
adjustments
in
the
reserves
in
the
life
insurance
area
that
make
it
comparable
to
the
kind
of
adjustments,
nonmethodological
adjustments
that
are
made
in
the
property
and
casualty?
justice
david
h.
souter
because
insurance
adjusters
call
in
and
they
say,
you
know,
there
was
a
big
loss,
the
roof
fell
in,
things
like
that.
that's
the--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
empirically
based
adjustments,
in
other
words.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
is
there
any
comparable
element
in
life
insurance?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
right,
but
that's...
that's
considered
in
the
formula,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
that's
a
function
of
the
methodology
that
they
use,
and
that
kind...
if
i
understand
what
you're
saying,
that
kind
of
adjustment
does
not
reflect
a
change
in
methodology,
it
reflects
an
implementation
of
the
methodology,
and
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what
kind
of
reserve
changes
in
the
life
area
do
not
reflect
implementations
of
previous
methodology?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
was
the
reason
for
having
a
special
rule
with
respect
to
the
'83
contracts?
you
say
that
was
what
the
sentence
addressed,
but
i've
never
understood
why
it
needed
to
address
it.
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
all
right,
then
why...
what
is
your
answer,
then,
to
this
argument.
i
mean,
the
argument
is...
would
normally
be
raised,
and
the
government
raises
it,
that
the
very
fact
that
that
sentence
is
in
there
saying,
it
shall
not
refer
to
this,
implies
that
in
the
absence
of
that
proviso
it
would
refer
to
these
kinds
of
practices.
your
answer
to
that
was,
well,
there
apparently
was
a
need
to
have
a
particular
rule
with
respect
to
contracts
for
this
particular
year,
but
if
we
don't
know
what
that
reason
was
for
a
particular
rule,
then
we're
back
to
the
negative
implication,
and
the
negative
implication
seems
to
support,
clearly
supports
the
government.
so
i
don't
understand
in
the...
if
you
don't
have
a
particular
explanation
for
why
there
was
a
need
for
that
sentence
for
those...
for
contracts
of
those
years,
i
don't
see
how
you
get
out
of
the
negative
implication.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
maybe
i
don't
understand,
but
i...
it
seems
to
me
that
the
companies
could
be
taking
those
kinds
of
actions
with
respect
to
contracts
entered
into
in
any
year,
and
why
did
they...
why
did
they
single
out
contracts
entered
into
in
one
particular
year?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
we
don't
know
what
it
is.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
thought
maybe...
help
me
out
on
this.
i
thought
at
one
point
you
were
saying
to
justice
kennedy
that
the
difference
in
agency
usage
in
the
life
area
was
such
that
the
proviso
simply
conformed
the
term
exactly
to
the
way
the
life
people
were
using
it.
that's
not
what
you
mean.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
that's
right,
yes.
justice
david
h.
souter
at
least
have
been
capable
of
meaning
more.
