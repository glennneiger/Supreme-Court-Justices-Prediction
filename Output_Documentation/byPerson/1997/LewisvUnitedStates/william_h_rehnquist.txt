chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-7151,
debra
faye
lewis
v.
united
states.
mr.
granger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
a
little
bit
depends
on
how
you
come
at
it,
doesn't
it,
mr.
granger?
i
mean,
i
think
you're
analyzing
it
and
very
likely
quite
proper
in
saying,
here's
how
congress
treated
murder,
but
if
you
say,
how
did
congress
treat
offenses
against
juveniles,
then
you
would
come
at
it
in
a
somewhat
different
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
wasn't
just
under
the
federal
murder
statute,
was
it?
that's
for
all
sentencing
for
all
federal
crimes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
granger,
now,
you
say...
one
of
the
questions
you
present
is
not
just
whether
your
client
was
prosecuted
under
the
proper
statute,
but
if
the
petitioner
was
not
properly
prosecuted
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
whether
or
not
the
sentence
was
proper.
now,
supposing
that
we
should
agree
with
you
on
your
argument
under
the
assimilated
crimes
act,
as
the
fifth
circuit
did,
the
fifth
circuit
said
nonetheless
your
client
should...
the
conviction
would
be
upheld
because
it
was
equally
a
violation
of
the
federal
act.
now,
what's
your
position
on
that
before
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
you're
not
asking
for
a
new
trial,
then.
at
one
point
in
your
brief
you
say
something
about
a
new
trial,
but
you're
saying
now
that
all
you're
asking
for
is
a
resentencing
under
the
appropriate
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
granger.
mr.
stewart,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
fact,
the
federal
enclave
residents
may
have
a
better
deal,
because
they
are
going
to
get
either
one
or
the
other,
but
people
off
the
enclave
may
get
both.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stewart.
mr.
granger,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which
section
is
it
again?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
granger.
the
case
is
submitted.
