justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
if,
in
fact,
you
have
a
federal
statute
that
forbids
bank
robbery
in
general,
then
the
state
could
punish
a
person...
it's
assimilated
because
they
have
a
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
to
forbid...
to
rob
a
state
bank.
that's
all.
you
have...
the
federal
law
says,
punishable
to
rob
any
bank,
and
now
louisiana
has
a
statute
that
says,
it's
punishable
to
rob
a
state
bank.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i
mean,
my
goodness--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
sounds
like
a
rather
odd
result.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
what...
they
are
special.
they
have
a
special
certificate
that
says
the
state
bank
examiner,
and
they
hang
that
on
the
wall.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
is.
they
have
that
certificate.
but
the
other...
taking
the
other
part
of
your
argument,
i
take
it
that
the
only...
the
only
difference
here,
really,
is
the
death
penalty,
that
if,
in
fact,
we
assimilate
the
state
law,
the
defendant's
eligible
for
the
death
penalty,
and
if
we
don't...
i
mean,
that's
what
turns
on
first
degree
versus
second
degree.
second
degree
in
louisiana
has
a
mandatory
life
without
parole,
so
the
only
thing
putting
it
in
the
first
degree
is
the
death
penalty,
and
if
that's
so,
if
that's
all
louisiana's
done
between
going
from
louisiana
two
to
louisiana
one,
can
we
really
say
that
congress
has
not
made
any
determination
about
when
they
want
a
federal
death
penalty?
i
mean,
my
thought
is
that
they've
been
debating
that
in
congress
for
30
years,
and
it's
normally
a
very
hot
issue,
and
when
congress
lists
a
whole
lot
of
crimes
and
doesn't
put
on
the
death
penalty
but
does
on
some
others,
how
is
that
any
different
from
the
statutory
rape?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
no,
it's
the
same.
i
mean,
the
question
is
whether...
you're
arguing
that
the
murder
one
statute
in
louisiana
applies.
i
take
it
you
don't
argue
the
murder
two
statute
applies,
do
you?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
if...
so,
fine,
and
the
main
difference
between
the
murder
one
and
the
murder
two
in
louisiana,
in
fact
i
think
the
only
difference,
is
the
death
penalty.
and
if
you
then
compare
it
with
the
federal
law,
what
you
discover,
as
you
said,
is
a
big
difference,
i
would
think,
is
the
death
penalty,
and
then
in
addition
the
term
of
years
is
longer,
so
you
have
both.
that's
true.
the
death
penalty
seems
a
big
part
of
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
1994
they
passed
a
huge
law
that
has
chapters
in
it
like
crimes
against
children,
violence
against
women,
amending
the
assault
statute,
and
so
forth.
i
thought
congress
has
now
specifically
focused
on
this.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
trouble
with
the...
i
can
see
the
practical
consequence
being,
well,
so
what,
they
just
have
both
jurisdictions.
on
the
other
hand,
this
book
of
the
federal
criminal
code
didn't
used
to
be,
but
now
it's
many
times
bigger
than
most
state
codes,
and
so
what
i
would
fear
with
your
approach
is,
thousands
of
cases
we're
parsing
the
words
of...
differently
written
in
state
and
federal
statutes
to
try
to
figure
out
whether
your
analytic
test
or
your
other
test
or
both
are
or
are
not
applicable.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
didn't
think
so.
well,
why
don't...
isn't
there
a
way
to
get
it
in
which
is,
you
want
to
know
whether
congress,
in
passing
these
other
laws,
really
intended
to
forego
picking
up
the
louisiana
law,
and
i
guess
congress
would
look
at
what
the
difference
is,
wouldn't
it?
