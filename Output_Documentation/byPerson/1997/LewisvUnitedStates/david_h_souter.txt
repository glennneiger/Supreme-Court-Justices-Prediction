justice
david
h.
souter
was
that
true
in
1993?
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this
question.
did
that,
the
specific
breakdown
come
in
the
1994
amendments?
justice
david
h.
souter
--do
you
take
the
position
essentially
that
the
government
does
on
the
criterion...
and,
by
the
way,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
you
give
your
case
away
if
you
do
this,
but
i
think
you
and
the
government
are
getting
close,
because
toward
the
end
of
the
government's
brief
the
government
says,
if
i
remember
rightly,
that
the
question
we
should
ask
is
whether
congress
has
made
a
considered
judgment
that
the
particular
peculiarity
of
state
law
which
might
be
argued
to
override
the
federal...
the
general
federal
statute
should
have
no
bearing,
and
it's
kind
of
a
field
preemption
sort
of
concept,
and
i
think
that's
essentially
what
you're
arguing.
am
i
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
i
mean
you're
saying...
as
i
understand
it,
you're
saying
that
on
the
basis
of
reading
the
congressional
statute
and
saying,
in
effect,
this
looks
like
a
statute
which
is
meant
to
cover
the
whole
waterfront
of
murder.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
on
your
theory,
i
take
it
we
still
would
not
know
what
offense
was
the
appropriate
offense
to
focus
on,
and
i
take
it
that's
the
issue
that
you
deal
with
under
the
concept
of
punishables,
is
that
right?
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
if
the
state
law
offense
is
more
specifically
described,
if
the
level
of
generality
is
lower,
we
look
to
a
state
law
offense.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
yours
is
a
purely
analytical
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
a
congressional
intent
test.
it's
a
purely
analytical
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
on
that
point,
what
if
congress
had
a
child
murder
statute
and
then
repealed
it,
and
then
this
case
arises?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
then
it
isn't
just
an
analytical
test.
justice
david
h.
souter
doesn't
that
say
that
you've
got
to
have
your
analytical
criterion
plus
something
more,
because
in
the
williams
case
the
level
of
specificity
was
precisely
the
same,
i.e.,
certain
ages
are
to
be
considered
in
deciding
what
the
offense
is.
and
the
issue
in
williams,
i
suppose,
was,
did
congress
intend
the
details
of
the
level
of
specificity
that
it
chose
to
prevail
over
the
details
of
the
level
of
specificity,
age
of
victim,
that
the
state
chose?
and
so
ultimately,
and
i
would
suppose
even
on
your
specificity
criterion,
you'd
have
to
say,
well,
we
infer
that
congress
meant
its
particular
choice
of
ages
to
prevail
over
the
state's
particular
choice
of
ages.
justice
david
h.
souter
and
is...
doesn't
that
have
to
be,
as
it
were,
an
adjunct
to
your
analytical
test,
because
at
some
times
your
test
is
going
to
produce,
as
it
were,
a
tie.
you're
not
going
to
know.
justice
david
h.
souter
in
other
words,
to
look
to
intent,
it
would
have
been
an
intent
argument,
an
intent
of
congress
argument.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
go
behind
that
with
this
question?
what
gives
me
pause
about
the...
let's
say
the
primacy
of
your
analytical
test,
so
that
you
get
to
the
intent
element
only
if
there's...
if
you
need
a
tiebreaker,
more
or
less,
my
concern
about
giving
the
primacy
to
the
purely
analytical
test
is
that,
with
respect
to
every
statute,
criminal
statute
that
congress
passes,
it
will
have
to
remain
constantly
on
guard
to
see
whether
a
state
legislature
addresses
the
general
criminal
conduct
in
a
slightly
more
specific
way,
knowing
on
your
test
that,
if
the
state
legislature
does,
suddenly
the
federal
statute
has
shrunk.
and
it's
very
difficult...
i
mean,
since
we're
construing
an
act
of
congress
here,
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
believe
that
congress
would
have
meant
us
to
interpret
it
in
a
way
that
is
in
effect
going
to
force
congress
to
keep
its
eye
on
what's
going
on
in
every
single
state
legislature
whenever
it's
in
session,
just
to
see
if
the
legislature
addresses
a
general
problem
with
a
statute
of
greater
specificity
than
congress
does.
what's
your
response?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
doesn't
say
that
any
more.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
you
have
to...
i
mean,
the
corollary
of
that
is,
every
time
congress
enacts
a
general
criminal
statute,
it's
doing
it
at
least
with
the
imputed
intent
that
that
statute
will,
in
fact,
become
inapplicable
within
the
enclaves
if
there
is
now
or
hereafter
a
more
specific
state
statute,
and
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
no,
but
isn't...
doesn't
that...
i
mean,
doesn't
justice
breyer's
question
raise
the
same
problem,
in
effect,
that
williams
raises,
because
it's
quite
true
congress
did
not
make
this
precise
category
of
murder
a
separate
offense
the
way
the
state
did,
so
you
say,
aha,
the
state
statute
is
at
a
lower
level
of
generality,
at
a
higher
level
of
specificity,
and
therefore
it
prevails.
and
yet
what
congress
has
done,
at
least
in
'94...
i
realize
this
is
a
'93
crime,
but
just
for
analytical
purposes
here,
what
congress
has
done
is
to
say,
aha,
there
will
be
this
specific
murder
category,
that
specific
murder
category,
that
specific
category
of
crimes
against
children,
and
that
sounds
a
lot
like
what
was
going
on
in
williams.
it
sounds
as
though
congress
is
saying,
yeah,
we
are,
in
fact,
going
to
legislate
at
a
very
high
level
of
specificity,
but
we're
not
going
to
make
a
specific
murder
provision
for
this
particular
subcategory,
and
that
sounds
a
lot
like
williams.
and
therefore
i
would
suppose
that
if
you
follow
the
williams
analysis
you
would
say,
both
state
and
federal
are
legislating
at
the
same
level
of
specificity,
and
we
think
the
federal
crime
ought
to...
if
you
follow
the
williams
analogy,
we
think
the
federal...
that
congress'
intent
was
not
to
assimilate,
that
the
federal
crime
would
be
the
sole
one
because
it
had
addressed
the
issue
and
probably
meant
to
occupy
the
field.
why
do
you
come
out
differently
here?
justice
david
h.
souter
congress
has
said
what
particular
crimes
ought
to
be
defined
with
reference
to
children,
or
reference
to
age.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
this
is
the...
well,
go...
i'm
sorry.
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
well,
it's
an
act
or
omission
made
punishable,
and
i
suppose
it's
a
legitimate
question
to
say,
well,
made
punishable
how?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
as
justice
breyer
suggested,
when
you
ask,
made
punishable
how,
by
a
lot,
by
a
little,
you
are,
in
fact,
focusing
ultimately
on
an
issue
of
intent,
and
i
take
it...
i
mean,
that's
what
you
want
us
to
do,
i
take
it.
