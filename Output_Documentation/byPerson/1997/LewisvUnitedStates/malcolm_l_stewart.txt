mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
text
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
is
set
forth
at
page
2
of
the
government's
brief,
and
i
think
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case
hinges
on
analysis
of
two
phrases
within
that
statute.
the
first
is
the
phrase,
act
or
omission,
the
second
is
the
phrase,
made
punishable,
and
i'd
like
to
address
them
in
that
order.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i...
as
to
the
phrase,
act
or
omission,
i
think
it
hinges
on
interpreting
them.
the
phrase,
act
or
omission,
is
often
used
to
refer
to
a
particular
incident
of
primary
conduct.
that
is,
this
court
has
frequently
stated
that
a
single
act
may
constitute
more
than
one
offense,
and
in
that
situation
it's
used
in
contradistinction
to
offense.
on
the
other
hand,
it
would
not
be
unnatural
to
say,
for
example,
that
18
u.s.c.
1111
defines
murder
as
the
act
of
killing
a
human
being
with
malice
aforethought,
in
which
case
the
word
act
would
be
used
not
to
refer
to
a
particular
incident
at
a
particular
time
and
place,
but
to
a
category
of
conduct
meeting
the
requisite
specifications,
and
in
our
view
the
words
act
or
omission
in
this
statute
should
be
construed
to
mean,
offense.
the
question
is
whether
the
state
law
offense
is
made
punishable
by
an
enactment
of
congress,
and
i
think
there
are
several
reasons--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it's
not...
that's
not
quite
our
view,
because
i
think...
i'll
get
to
made
punishable
in
more
detail,
but
i
think
the
short
answer
is,
one
of
the
features
of
the
blockburger
test
is
that
a
greater
and
a
lesser
included
offense
are
treated
as
the
same
offense
for
double
jeopardy
purposes,
and
that
would
not
be
our
position
with
respect
to
this
statute.
that
is,
if
state
law
has
defined
a
greater
offense,
we
would
not
say
that
that
has
been
made
punishable
by
an
act
of
congress
simply
because
congress
has
defined
a
lesser
included
offense,
as
in
this
case.
but
to
return
to
the
phrase--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
first
of
all
it's
obviously
not
unusual
for
people
living
outside
federal
enclaves
to
be
subject
to
both
federal
and
state
criminal
laws.
indeed,
individuals
can
often
be
subjected
to
successive
prosecutions
by
the
two
sovereigns
for
the
same
criminal
act.
now,
it's
true
that
individuals
residing
on
federal
enclaves
are
subject
to
some
federal
criminal
provisions
that
are
applicable
only
to
the
enclaves,
and
in
that
sense
they
face
a
distinctive
burden.
on
the
other
hand,
there
is
no
comprehensive
federal
criminal
code
applicable
to
the
enclaves.
moreover,
an
individual
on
the
enclaves
has
the
commensurate
advantage
that
the
only
prosecution
that
can
be
brought
will
be
brought
by
federal
authorities
and,
therefore,
while
individuals
residing
outside
the
enclaves
may
face
successive
prosecutions
for
what
would
be
the
same
offense
in
blockburger
terms,
the
individuals
on
the
enclaves
will
have
that
added
protection.
but
again,
to
return
to
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
exactly
right.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
exactly
right,
and
i
think
the
resolution
of
this
case
ultimately
hinges
on
how
the
court
views
the
concept
of
applying
state
law
norms
on
federal
enclaves.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
the
only
sovereign
that
can
prosecute
is
the
federal
government,
although
the
federal
government
may
invoke
assimilated
state
laws.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
let
me--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--my
second...
i
do
want
to
focus
briefly
at
least
on
the
words
act
or
omission,
because
i
think
the
meaning
of
made
punishable
is
easier
to
follow
if
the
words
act
or
omission
are
first
made
clear.
that
is,
i
think
for
a
variety
of
reasons
it
is
appropriate
to
interpret
the
phrase,
act
or
omission,
to
mean
the
state
law
offense
that
is
sought
to
be
assimilated.
first
of
all,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
his
hypothetical,
the
contrary
reading
would
create
absurd
results.
that
is,
in
a
hypothetical
situation
in
which
the
federal
government
had
an
assault
statute
but
no
murder
statute
a
state
would...
the
federal
government
would
be
precluded
from
proceeding
on
an
assimilated
state
murder
charge
simply
because
the
primary
conduct
would
have
constituted
assault
under
federal
law.
to
focus
on
the
individual
incident
of
primary
conduct
would
have
a
second
practical
infirmity
as
well.
that
is,
from
the
standpoint
of
sound
judicial
administration
it's
certainly
important
that
the
propriety
of
an
assimilated
crimes
act
prosecution
can
be
determined
at
the
outset
of
the
proceeding,
but
an
indictment
typically
doesn't
contain
any
lengthy
recitation
of
the
primary
conduct
in
which
the
individual
is
alleged
to
have
engaged.
it
does
contain
a
summary
of
the
essential
nature
and
elements
of
the
offense
with
which
he
is
charged.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
your
honor,
and
if
the
test
ultimately
turned
on
whether
act,
the
conduct
proved
at
trial
would
have
violated
some
federal
statute,
first
you
wouldn't
know
up
front,
and
second
you
could
even
have
the
bizarre
situation
in
which
the
defendant
attempted
to
introduce
evidence
showing
that
his
conduct
did,
in
fact,
violate
a
federal
statute
even
though
the
evidence
introduced
by
the
prosecution
had
not
shown
that,
so
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
when
we
ask
whether
an
offense
is
made
punishable
the
offense
should
be
the
state
law
crime
with
which
the
individual
is
charged,
and
in
this
case
it's
very
clear
what
that
was.
the
jury
was
instructed
at
the
close
of
petitioner's
trial
that
in
order
to
find
the
petitioner
guilty
it
had
to
find
that
she
killed
jadasha
lowery,
that
she
acted
with
intent
to
kill
or
do
great
bodily
harm,
and
that
the
victim
was
under
12
years
old.
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--if...
in
determining
whether
the
offense
is
made
punishable
we
first
look
to
the
state
law
offense
as
defined
by
the...
its
essential
elements,
and
then
the
next
question
is,
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
a
state
law
offense
has
been
made
punishable
by
an
enactment
of
congress,
and
in
our
view
a
state
law
offense
has
been
made
punishable
by
an
enactment
of
congress
only
if
congress
has
addressed
the
class
of
conduct
that
constitutes
the
state
offense
at
the
same
level
of
specificity
as
the
state.
now,
that
will
be
true
most
obviously--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
is
almost
exclusively
a
purely
analytical
test.
that
is,
in
the
great
majority
of
cases
the
question
of
whether
the
state
law
offense
has
been
made
punishable
by
an
enactment
of
congress
can
be
resolved
by
asking,
is
there
a
federal
statute
that
contains
precisely
the
same
essential
elements
as
the
state
statute,
so
we
can--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that
would
be
a
closer
case.
i
think
that
probably
wouldn't
be
clear
enough,
but
i
would
like
to--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
isn't
purely
an
analytical
test,
and
i
think
the
court
in
williams
addressed
a
situation
in
which
there
were
federal
laws
on
the
federal
enclaves
that
prohibited
adultery,
fornication,
and
what
was
called
carnal
knowledge,
what
is
usually
termed
statutory
rape,
and
the
federal
carnal
knowledge
law
set
the
age
of
consent
at
16,
made
it
a
crime
to
have
sexual
intercourse
with
a
person
not
the
wife
of
the
wrongdoer
who
was
under
the
age
of
16.
the
state
statute
set
the
age
of
consent
at
18,
and
the
question
was
whether
the
use
of
the
assimilated...
assimilative
crimes
act
was
precluded
by
the
federal
statute.
now,
it
was
not
the
case
that
there
was
any
federal
statute
that
had
precisely
the
same
elements
as
the
state
offense,
so
part
1
of
our
test
wouldn't
be
met
here,
but
the
court,
surveying
all
the
available
evidence,
concluded
that
the
reason
there
was
no
federal
offense
having
exactly
those
same
elements
was
that
congress
had
considered
the
matter
and
had
decided
that
such
an
offense
was
not
warranted.
that
is,
congress
had
considered
specifically
at
what
age
does
an
individual
become
capable
of
giving
meaningful
consent
to
sexual
relations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that
was
certainly
the
court's
inference,
but--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
that's
correct.
that's
why
i
said
that
assimilation
is
precluded
if
either
there
is
a
federal
statute
with
precisely
the
same
elements
as
the
state
statute,
or...
and
i
think
the
second
category
will
be
very
rare
cases...
there
is
highly
persuasive
evidence
that
congress
has
considered
the
matter
at
the
same
level
of
specificity
as
the
state.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
probably
correct.
at
least--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--at
least--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--at
least
if
there
were
any
basis
for
the
conclusion
that
state
banks
were
in
some
sense--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
might
be
the
case
that
if
there
was
nothing
different
about
state
banks
we
could
presume
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
the
other
point
that
turns...
the
other
point
that
depends
on
choice
between
the
assimilative
crimes
act
and
the
federal
murder
statute
is
that
the
louisiana
first
degree
murder
statute
provides
for
a
mandatory
life
sentence
even
if
the
death
penalty
is
not
sought,
whereas
the
federal
murder
statute
provides
that
the
defendant
may
be
sentenced
to
any
term
of
years
or
for
life,
so
even
in
this
case,
where
the
government
didn't
seek
the
death
penalty,
it
had
potential
practical
significance
to
the
penalty
that
was
imposed.
i
think...
to
return
to
williams,
i
think
in
a
sense
we
could
say
that
this
is
the
case
that
williams
would
have
been
had
there
been
no
federal
carnal
knowledge
statute.
that
is,
at
the
time
williams
was
decided,
there
were
federal
adultery
and
fornication
statutes
that
broadly
prohibited
all
acts
of
sexual
intercourse
on
the
federal
enclaves
between
people
who
were
not
married
to
each
other,
and
i
suppose
it
would
have
been
open
to
williams,
even
in
the
absence
of
a
carnal
knowledge
statute,
to
say
congress
has
occupied
the
field.
the
absence
of
any
statutory
rape
provision
should
be
taken
to
reflect
an
implicit
determination
that
congress
believes
the
age
of
the
parties
to
be
irrelevant--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
is
an
intent
of--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
there
are
two
responses.
at
the
most
basic
level,
the
reason
that
congress
is
in
that
predicament,
if
you
want
to
call
it
that,
is
simply
that
it's
enacted
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
but
the
second
reason
is
that
up
until
1948,
the
way
the
assimilative
crimes
act
was
worded
it
said
that
people
can
be
prosecuted
for
committing
state
crimes
that
were
in
effect
under
the
law
of
the
state
at
the
time
of
the
last
reenactment
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it
doesn't
say
that
any
more.
and
so
up
until
1948
it
was
possible
at
least
to
indulge
the
fiction
that
congress
had
chosen
to
assimilate
state
law
because
it
had
individually
examined
the
laws
of
the
states
and
found
them
to
be
good.
what
congress
did
in
1948
was
in
essence
say,
we
trust
the
states
enough
to
provide
for
the
assimilation
of
state
law
offenses
that
have
not
even
been
enacted,
that
we've
had
no
opportunity
to
scrutinize,
because
we
see
an
independent
value
in
maintaining
consistency
between
the
law
within
the
enclaves
and
the
law
of
the
surrounding
areas.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
the
federal
statute
would
not
be
rendered
inapplicable
simply
because
the
assimilative
crimes
act
is
available.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
it's
a
common
rule
that
this
court
has
announced
most
obviously
in--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--right,
subject
to
choice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
subject
to
choice.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
that's
correct,
and
i
think
if
we
look
at
the
development
of
the
federal
murder...
if
we
look
at
the
development
of
the
federal
murder
statute,
that
the
statute
itself
doesn't
speak
to
the
age
of
the
victim,
and
one
might
ask
the
question,
why
has
congress
failed
to
enact
a
child
murder
provision,
and
one
possible
answer
would
be
that
congress
has
scrutinized
laws
like
louisiana
and
finds
them
to
be
unwise.
another
answer
might
be,
congress
understands
that
the
assimilative
crimes
act
is
out
there,
and
is
content
for
child
murder
provisions
either
to
be
enforced
or
not
be
enforced.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
there
has
been,
and
i
think
this...
the
case
would
present
different
questions
if
we
attempted
to
impose
the
death
penalty
under
the
assimilative
crimes
act.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
no.
that
would
essentially
duplicate
the--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
so.
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
but
the
assimilative
crime
act
does
say
at
the
end
of
the
section
that
a
person
who
is
guilty
of
an
act
or
omission
which
is,
although
not
made
punishable
by
federal
law,
is
made
punishable
by
state
law,
shall
be
guilty
of
a
like
offense
and
subject
to
a
like
punishment.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
agree
with
that.
when
i--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--it
first
changed
it
to
act
or
thing,
which
was
subsequently
changed
to
act
or
omission.
the
reason
that
was
given
in
the
legislative
history
was
that
it
seemed
incongruous
to
use
the
phrase...
the
word
offense
to
describe
something
that
was
not
in
fact
defined
as
offense
by
federal
law,
and
this
court
in
williams
stated
that
the
expressed
intent
of
the
committee
was
to
continue
in
force
rather
than
to
change
the
substantive
meaning
of
the
statute.
and
again,
it
would
have
been
easy
in
williams...
if
the
court
had
believed
in
williams
that
the
phrase,
act
or
omission
should
refer
to
a
particular
incident
of
primary
conduct,
it
would
have
been
easy
for
the
court
in
williams
to
say,
this
person
would
have
been
guilty
of
adultery
under
federal
law,
and
stopped
there.
the
court
instead
embarked
on
a
lengthy
analysis
of
congress'
development
of
a
federal
statutory
rape
law
and
arrived
at
the
conclusion
that
congress
had
implicitly
decided
that
individuals
aged
16
or
17
were
capable
of
giving
meaningful
consent
to
sexual
relations.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
looking
at
the
system
as
a
whole
there
is
some
role
to
play
in
considering
the
age
of
the
victim
in
sentencing
a
defendant
on
a
charge
of
federal
second
degree
murder.
that
doesn't
mean
that
congress
has
addressed
the
question
at
the
same
level
of
specificity
as
the
states.
and
the
point
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
was,
we
really
don't
know
why
congress
has
failed
to
enact
a
child
murder
provision,
whether
it's
because
they
find
such
a
provision
to
be
undesirable,
whether
it's
because
they're
content
to
let
the
states
do
what
they
will
on
the
enclaves,
or
whether
they
simply
hasn't...
haven't
thought
about
it.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
certainly
congress
has
addressed
some
aspects
of
the
problem
of
violence
against
children.
the
point
i
was
making
was,
congress
has
not
enacted
a
provision
that
speaks
directly
to
the
question,
when
is
the
age
of
a
murder
victim
deemed
to
be
a
more
culpable
offense,
and
i
think
that
what
you
do
with
that--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--well,
i
think
there
are
two
reasons.
first,
we
do
see
a
difference
in
specificity
as
between
this
case
and
williams.
that
is,
in
williams,
congress
really
had
focused
on
the
precise
question,
at
what
age
does
an
individual
become
capable
of
giving
legally
meaningful
consent
to
sexual
relations,
and
that's
on
a
different
level
of
generality
from
what
congress
has
done
in
the
statutes
that
you
refer
to,
namely,
address
other
parts
of
the
problem
of
violence
against
children.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
what
is
really
crucial
here
is
the
default
rule
that
the
court
adopts.
that
is,
if
the
court's
default
rule
is
that
application
of
state
law
to
federal
enclaves
should
be
treated
with
suspicion,
should
be
reserved
for
those
situations
where
we
really
feel
quite
sure
that
congress
hasn't
spoken
to
the
question
at
all,
then
you're
right,
we
lose.
our
default
rule
is
that
individuals
all
over
the
country
are
normally
subject
to
concurrent
state
and
federal
jurisdiction,
and
an
individual
should
be
insulated
from
potential
prosecution
and
punishment
for
state
law
crimes
only
if
congress
has
made
it
very,
very
clear
that
it
has
addressed
the
precise
question
at
issue
and
has
arrived
at
a
different
conclusion.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
well--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
you're
right.
i
think
we
are
construing
the
phrase,
made
punishable.
we
are
asking,
what
does
it
mean
to
say
that
a
state
law
offense
has
been
made
punishable
by
an
act
of
congress,
and
our
view
is,
it's
been
made
punishable
only
if
congress
has
spoken
very
precisely
to
the
specific
class
of
conduct
that
constitutes
the
state
offense.
but
we
would
readily
concede
we
don't
particularly
draw
that
from
the
literal,
necessary
significance
of
the
words,
made
punishable.
we
draw
it
instead
from
what
we
take
to
be
the
underlying
premises
of
the
assimilative
crime
act.
that
is--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
don't
know
how
that
will
work.
certainly
the
result
of
our
solution
will
be
that
there
will
be
more
cases
in
which
the
federal
prosecutor
will
have
a
choice
between
two
statutes,
and
i
would
suppose
at
least
in
some
of
those
cases
the
prosecutor
will
choose
the
one
that
has
the
harsher
penalty.
what
the
point--
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
--i
think
it
is
a
different
kind
of
question.
when
i
spoke
of
the
background
norm
that
individuals
are
typically
subject
to
concurrent
state
and
federal
law,
obviously
congress
could
have
adopted
a
different
regime
for
the
enclaves
if
had
chosen.
for
one
thing,
congress
might
have
decided,
for
instance,
that
the
criminal
law
applicable
to
all
the
federal
enclaves
shall
be
the
criminal
code
of
the
district
of
columbia,
which
in
a
sense
is
the
quintessential
federal
enclave.
if
congress
had
placed
preeminent
importance
on
maintaining
uniformity
among
the
enclaves,
a
solution
like
that
might
have
occurred
to
it.
i
think
the
solution
that
it
chose,
assimilating
state
law,
reflects
the
premise
that
there
was
an
independent
value
in
maintaining
consistency
between
the
enclaves
and
the
surrounding
areas
of
the
state,
that
an
enclave
is
in
a
meaningful
respect
part
of
the
state
in
which
it's
located.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
that's
correct.
with...
again,
with
the
reminder
that
because
the
prosecution
would
be
brought
by
a
single
sovereign,
the
double
jeopardy
rules
applicable
to
multiple
punishments
would
apply
as
they
would
to
any
claim
of
multiple
punishments
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
malcolm
l.
stewart
i
think
our
test
is
actually
easier
to
administer
than
the
competing
test.
that
is,
it's
certainly
not
going
to
be
a
problem
to
compare
the
elements
of
a
state
offense
to
the
elements
of
the
federal
offense
that's
alleged
to
be
preemptive
and
determine
whether
they
are
precisely
the
same
elements.
now,
it's
true
that
the
second
step
of
our
inquiry
will
involve
a
certain
amount
of
indeterminacy,
but
again,
our
basic
point
is,
the
use
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act
should
be
precluded
only
when
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
has
spoken
to
the
precise
question
and
that,
in
the
run
of
cases,
is
going
to
be
an
easier
test
to
administer
than
simply
one
that
asks,
is
it
close
enough.
