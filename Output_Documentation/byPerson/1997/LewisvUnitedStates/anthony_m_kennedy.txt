justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i'm
not
sure
what
your
test
is.
your
brief
at
some
point
talks
about
conduct.
at
other
points
it
talks
about
the
nature
of
the
offense.
it
seems
to
me
what
you're
saying
now
that
congress
has
addressed
the
general
subject
area,
and
that
that
should
suffice.
i
take
it
that's
the
standard
you're
asking
us
to
apply.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
maybe
you're
not,
but
i'm
just...
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
you
want
us
to
define
a
general
subject
in
a,
sort
of
a
preemption
context.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
granger,
i
want
to
get
clear
on
one
thing.
you
referred...
in
answering
justice
ginsburg
you
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
statute
covered
it.
is
your
test
an
analytical
test?
in
other
words,
you
can
determine
it...
you
apply
it
solely
by
looking
at
the
terms
of
state
statute,
in
terms
of
federal
statute,
or
is
it
an
analytical
test
plus
an
intent
test,
so
that
at
the
end
of
the
day
you
say,
can
we
infer
from
everything
we
know,
including
what's
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
that
congress
intended
to
cover
this
particular
conduct
exclusively
by
the
federal
statute?
is
it
a
purely
analytical
test,
or
is
it
ultimately
an
intent
test?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
were
you
going
to
focus
on
the
word
punishable
in
this--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--was
that
your
second--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
began
with
a
construction
of
the
statute,
and
i...
as
i
understand
it,
all
that
did
for
us
was
to
get
us
out
of
the
conduct
test.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
now
we're
arguing,
or
trying
to
decide
whether
or
not
your
specificity
test
or
what
i
would
call
the
preemption
test
of
the
petitioner
is
the
better
of
the
two,
and
i
don't
think
the
statute
helped
us
much
between
those
two
alternatives,
or
am
i--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--is
the
result
of
your
submission
that
in
most
cases
the
harsher
of
the
two
sanctions
will
apply,
or
is
that
not
the
way
it's
going
to
work
most
of
the
time?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
stewart,
your
answer
to
justice
scalia
pointed
out
quite
rightly
that
concurrent
jurisdiction
and...
i
mean,
concurrent...
subjection
to
concurrent
schemes
of
law
is
the
norm
now.
is
that
a
legitimate
basis
for
us
to
consider
in
construing
this
statute,
because
this
statute
was
intended
to
address
the
case
in
which
there
is
a
hiatus,
shall
state
law
fill
it,
and
now
you're
saying,
well,
we'll
use
this
statute
to
answer
a
different
question.
there
is,
we
presume,
a
concurrence,
and
when
is
it
illegitimate
not
to
recognize
that
concurrence,
and
that's
a
different
kind
of
question.
