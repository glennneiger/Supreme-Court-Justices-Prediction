justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
granger,
you're
not
really
arguing
that
we
should
stick
to
the
words
of
the
statute,
are
you?
i
mean,
the
words
of
the
statute
say,
if
the
act,
any
act
or
omission
not
made
punishable
by
any
enactment
of
congress.
that's
the
condition.
it
has
to
be
an
act
or
omission
which
is
not
made
punishable
by
any
enactment
of
congress.
now,
i
assume,
if
you
follow
the
language
of
the
statute
and
you
beat
somebody
to
death
and
congress
had
an
assault
statute
but
not
a
murder
statute,
that
would
be
covered
by
that
language,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
not
prosecute
under
state
law
for
the
murder,
because
the
act
or
omission
was
punishable.
what
he
did,
the
beating
of
this
person
which
resulted
in
death,
but
that
was
the
act
or
omission,
it
is
punishable,
so
you
would
only
be
able
to
prosecute
under
federal
law
for
assault
and
no
murder
prosecution,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
other
words,
you're
urging
us
to
ignore
the
words,
act
or
omission.
i
mean,
the
statute
doesn't
deal
with
type
of
offense.
it
says,
act
or
omission,
and
we're
all
agreed
that
we
should
forget
about
that
because
it
doesn't
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
agree
to
that,
don't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
hinges
on
either
observing
them
or
ignoring
them,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
effect
of
that
kind
of
interpretation
is
to
say
that
every
poor
devil
who
lives
in
a
federal
enclave
is
subjected
to
two
total
systems
of
criminal
law.
you
think
that's
what
congress
had
in
mind?
this
is
a
very
old
statute,
and
i
sort
of
regarded
it
as,
you
know,
just
to
fill
in
the
gaps
where
there
are
so
many
federal,
you
know,
basic
crimes,
basic
wicked
things
that
were
not
at
that
time
punished
by
federal
law.
there
are
very
few
wicked
things
that
aren't
punished
by
federal
law.
why
shouldn't
we
just
call
a
halt
to
the
expansion
of
this
assimilative
crimes
act?
i
don't
know
why
we
want
to
make
everybody
subject
to
twice
as
many
different
series
of
statutes
just
because
they're
living
on
a
federal
enclave.
why
wouldn't
it
be
enough
just
to
say
they're
subject
to
federal
law
and
this
thing
has
either
no
application
any
more
or
it
will
be
a
rare,
rare
case
where
it
has
application?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
good
point.
you're
saying
that
i'm
looking
at
it
precisely
wrong,
that
the
question
is
whether...
isn't
whether
people
on
the
enclaves
shall
be
subjected
to
dual
criminal
laws
which
other
people
aren't,
but
whether
they
will
be
treated
like
everybody
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
subject
to
both
state
and
federal
law
for
the
most
part.
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
the
same
argument
made
in
favor
of
blockburger
as
the
test
for
double
jeopardy.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
know
it
up
front.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
have
both.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
be
subject
to
choice.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
isn't--
--just
as
it
is
in
the
states,
anyway.
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
would
have
to
face
that
question
with
respect
to
citizens
who
are
not
in
enclaves.
do
they
want
to
enact
a
federal
statute
that's
going
to
more
or
less
duplicate
state
statutes
that
already
exist?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
so.
how
do
you
squeeze
that
into
the
word,
act
or
omission?
i
mean,
whatever
else
the
assimilative
crime
act
doesn't
cover,
it
surely
bears
no
reference
to
what
the
punishment
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
like
punishment,
as
a
state
law,
but
as
to
the
question
of
whether
the
state
law
applies
or
not,
it's
a
difference
in
the
act
or
omission
which
you
want
to
define
as
offense,
and
maybe
you
can,
but
there's
no
way
to
define
act
or
omission
as
punishment,
and
if
you
can't
define
act
or
omission
as
punishment,
punishment
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
crime
is
assimilated
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
you
agree
with
that.
[laughter]
but
mr.
stewart,
could
you
remind
us
of,
there
was...
the
act
originally
used
the
word
offense,
and
then
it
changed
it
to
act
or
omission,
and
what
was
the
reason
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
relying
on
the
death
penalty.
did
you
do
that
in
your
brief?
i
don't
recall
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
seems
like
a
good
idea
to
you
now.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
tell
me
how
you
get
that
into
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
that
isn't
the
criterion--
justice
antonin
scalia
--of
whether
the
statute
assimilates
the
state
law
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
criterion
is
act
or
omission.
is
there
any
way
to
get
punishment
within
the
meaning
of
act
or
omission?
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
what
does
3551
say?
justice
antonin
scalia
fine,
but
how
does
that
relate
to
congress'
intent
that
justice
breyer
is
talking
about?
can
you
attach
that
congressional
intent
to
some
enactment?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
is
it
just
sort
of
a
wandering
congressional
intent
unreflected
in
the
united
states
code?
