justice
john
paul
stevens
but
why
is
it
the
murder
that's...
what
if
they
had
a
homicide
statute
and
say,
a
third...
or
a
manslaughter
provision
with
negligent
driving
of
a
vehicle,
or
a
few
other
examples,
but
none
that
omitted
what
is
the
counterpart
to
first
degree
murder,
would
you
say
that
had
dealt
with
the
subject
of
killing
the
victim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
want
to
be
sure...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
federal
statute
merely
went
so
far
as
most,
say,
second
degree
manslaughter,
the
very
least
severe
penalty,
that's
all
it
covered,
would
the
deliberate
killing
be
covered
by
the
federal
statute
or
by
the
state
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
federal
statute,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
you
would
then
look
to
the
state
law.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
then
why
don't
you
look
to
state
law
if
it's
not
more
serious
because
of
deliberateness
versus
negligence,
but
rather
because
the
state
has
chosen
to
give
special
protection
to
youthful
victims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
quite
understand
the
logic
of
your
position.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
just...
they
haven't
said
it
can't
be.
i
mean,
they
just
have
omitted
a
particular
category.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
your
view,
just
to
sum
it
up,
that
we
apply
the
blockburger
test
unless
there's
something
in
the
federal
statute
that
trumps
it?
