justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
the
backdrop
against
which
that
was
adopted.
i
think
there
was
considerable
sentiment
at
the
time
that
basically
state
law
ought
to
apply
to
crimes
committed
in
areas
that
the
federal
government
was
administering,
and
what
do
you
think
our
policy
should
be
in
general,
to
find
that
state
law
should
apply
where
possible,
because
that
is
the
backdrop
under
which
this
statute
was
passed
in
the
first
place.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
most
federal
courts
have
interpreted
williams
as
adopting
some
kind
of
a
precise
acts
test.
i
don't
think
the
courts
generally
have
applied
the
assimilative
crimes
statute
very
literally.
it
reads
broadly,
certainly,
but
they've
instead
said
it's
some
kind
of
a
precise
acts
test.
do
you
agree
with
that
approach
in
most
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
about
abuse
of
a
child
carried
out
by
beating,
and
the
federal
law
just
has
an
assault
and
battery
statute,
but
the
state
law
has
a
specific
child
abuse
statute
that
would
govern,
what...
is
it
assimilated,
or
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
mean,
it's
so
curious,
because
it
all
depends
on
how
you
frame
the
generality
of
the
act.
the
act
is
the
beating
of
a
child.
well,
then
the
federal
law
covers
it.
no,
it's
abusing
a
child.
well,
then
the
state
law
covers
it.
how
do
we
know?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
do
you
answer
that
question?
which
one
applies
in
the
case
of
beating
a
child?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
pretty
close
to
saying
well,
murder
of
a
child
will
apply
the
state
law.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
thought
you
had
just
said
we
didn't
and,
indeed,
is
there
a
single
federal
court
that
has
given
it
a
literal
interpretation?
if
so,
what
one
and
what
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
congress
has
focused
a
lot
on
whether
it
wants
a
death
penalty
or
not,
and
in
what
circumstances.
there's
been
a
lot
of
focus
on
that.
