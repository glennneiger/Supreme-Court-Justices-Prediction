suppose
louisiana
had
a
statute
that
said,
abuse
of
a
child
is
an
offense,
juvenile
cruelty
is
an
offense.
then
in
your
view
would
it
be
perfectly
proper
for
the
u.s.
prosecutor
to
say,
i
have
one
charge
under
the
u.s.
code
for
murder,
and
a
second
charge
under
louisiana
law
for
cruelty
to
a
juvenile.
would
that
be
compatible?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
is
your
test,
then,
just
that
if
the
congressional
statute
covers
the
crime,
murder,
homicide,
then
you
don't
look
any
further,
that's
it?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it's...
you're
advocating
a
simple
test
that
the
federal
statute
covers
it,
that's
it.
you
don't
augment
it
in
any
way.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
going
back
to
what's
covered
or
not
covered,
the
point
where
you
are
in
disagreement
with
the
government,
suppose
we
have
the
murder
statute
that
we
have
on
the
federal
side,
the
victim
is
a
pregnant
woman,
and
the
state
also
has
a
murder
statute
but
then
it
has
a
separate
crime
of
feticide.
how
would
that...
would
that
be
something
that
under
your
theory
you
could
take
the
murder
from
the
federal
and
the
feticide
from
the
state?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
why
couldn't
one
decide,
looking
at
this
whole
picture,
as
was
suggested
by
mr.
granger,
i
think,
that
there's
the
punishment
for
murder,
and
then
there's
the
guidelines
that
say
you
take
into
account
the
vulnerability
of
the
victim,
so
looking
at
it
as
a
whole,
congress
has
essentially
dealt
with
these
elements
but
in
a
different
way?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
in
practical
effect,
then,
it
would
give
the
prosecutor
on
the
enclaves
the
kind
of
authority
that
the
u.s.
attorney
for
the
district
of
columbia
has.
that
is,
to
pick...
he
could...
here,
he
could
pick
also
courts,
but
pick
whether
to
indict
under
the
d.c.
code
or
under
the
u.s.
code.
