mr.
frank
granger
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
debra
lewis
was
charged,
tried,
and
convicted
under
an
assimilated
louisiana
murder
statute
for
a
crime
which
was
committed
on
a
military
reservation
in
vernon
parish,
louisiana.
she
was
not
charged
nor
tried
under
the
appropriate
federal
murder
statute.
on
appeal,
the
fifth
circuit
agreed
and
reversed
the
conviction
based
upon
the
assimilated
louisiana
statute,
finding
that
it
did
not
apply,
and
that
the
assimilative
crimes
act
did
not
allow
the
prosecutor
to
assimilate
the
state
statute
when,
in
fact,
a
federal
murder
statute
prohibited
the
conduct
for
which
she
was
charged.
however,
the
fifth
circuit
then
affirmed
the
life
imprisonment
sentence
based
upon
her
conviction
of
second
degree
federal
murder.
we
also
contend
that
the
affirmance
of
the
sentence
is
harmful
and
prejudicial
to
debra
lewis
because
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
applicable
to
federal
second
degree
murder,
such
a
sentence
could
not
be
imposed.
for
purposes
of
this
argument,
the
assimilative
crimes
act
is
a
longstanding
federal
statute
which
merely
is
a
gap
filling
and
a
loophole
closing
statute.
the
purpose
of
the
statute
was
to
prevent
and
allow
the
federal
government
to
prosecute
criminal
actions
on
military
reservations
on
territory
under
exclusive
federal
jurisdiction
when,
by
assimilating
a
state
criminal
statute
if,
and
only
if,
there
was
no
federal
statute
which
made
the
conduct
sort
to
be
prosecuted--
mr.
frank
granger
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
i
under...
i
agree
with
you,
but
once
the
assimilative
crimes
act
was
adopted
initially
in
approximately
1825,
it
was
because
congress
at
that
particular
point
in
time
had
not
taken
a
very
proactive
role
in
adopting
criminal
statutes,
so
what
happened
was,
you'd
have
a
person
commit
an
act
or
a
criminal...
or
a
crime
on
a
military
reservation
or
in
the
territories
and
then
be
able
to
flaunt
and
get
away
with
it.
so
as
justice
story
has
been
noted
to
say,
that
necessity...
in
fact,
he
was
one
of
the
authors
of
part
of
the
assimilative
crimes
act,
along
with
daniel
webster,
in
saying
that
we
have
to
allow
these
crimes
to
be
punished
and
close...
my
words,
close
the
loopholes
or
fill
the
gap.
there
is
great
sentiment
to
apply
state
law
on
these
reservations.
however,
congress
has
spoken.
in
18
u.s.c.
section
13,
which
i
have
at
page
5
of
my
brief,
the
original
brief,
it
says,
whoever
is
guilty
of
any
act
or
omission
which,
although
not
made
punishable
by
any
enactment
of
congress.
so
in
times
past,
and
in
this
particular
case
before
1909,
when
there
was
no
federal
murder
statute,
clearly
the
government
would
have
been
faced
with
a
proposition
that
it
couldn't
prosecute
for
murder,
so
obviously
they
had
to
assimilate
the
state
crime
and
say
we
can't
allow
you
to
get
away
with
this,
and
so
we'll
take
the
state
crime,
and
by
section
13,
it
becomes
a
federal
crime
and
we
prosecute
it.
i
think
in
this
particular
case
we
get
to
the
point
of
whether
the
particular
act
is
made
punishable
by
an
enactment
of
congress,
and
i
think
that
the
statutes
are
clear
again.
congress
has
adopted
the
federal
murder
statute
at
18
u.s.c.
section
1111,
which
you'll
find
at
page
5
and
6
of
my
brief.
this
statute
clearly
sets
forth
a
comprehensive
scheme
of
murder.
as
in
most
states,
there's
a
difference
between
first
degree
and
second
degree
murder.
congress
has
done
the
same
thing.
congress
has
found
that
there
would
be
first
degree
murders,
which
are
generally
murders,
or
killing
of
human
beings
with
malice
aforethought,
but
also
premeditated
murders
such
as
poison,
lying
in
wait,
or
again
they
have
another
group
of
murders
that
are
specifically
listed
as
first
degree
murders,
which
is
arson,
escape,
murder,
kidnapping,
treason,
espionage,
sabotage,
aggravated
sexual
abuse,
or
sexual
abuse,
burglary,
or
robbery.
mr.
frank
granger
there
may
have
been
an
amendment,
your
honor,
justice
souter,
as
to
the
aggravated
sexual
abuse
or
sexual
abuse,
but
the
other
provisions
were
specifically--
mr.
frank
granger
--however,
the
statute
is
also
clear,
it
says
any
other
murder,
and
that
is
explicit,
that
are
not
listed
as
first
degree
murder
is
murder
in
the
second
degree.
i
think
the
federal
murder
statute
is
very
clear--
mr.
frank
granger
--i
don't
entirely
agree
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
the
way
that
congress
has
specified
this
statute
is
merely
to
set
forth
the
crimes
in
two
broad
categories
that
are
fairly
com...
that
are
comprehensive.
however,
congress
also
has
another
way
of
doing
this,
because
i
know
the
issue
here
is
murder
of
a
child.
however,
if
we
looked
at
the
sentencing
guidelines...
i
believe
it's
section
381.2...
which
provides
for
an
enhancement
under
the
murder
statute
for
a
vulnerable
victim,
clearly,
congress
then
decided
that
when
you
have
younger
persons
we
have
to
make
an
allowance
and
enhance
the
penalty.
mr.
frank
granger
correct,
your
honor,
and
that
is
merely
to
take
into
account
the
fact
that
some
people
are
more
vulnerable
to
crimes,
such
as
older
people,
pigeon
drops,
or
things
of
that
nature,
or
in
our
particular
situation
here,
where
you
have
a
younger
person,
a
child
who
is
being
abused,
who
is
actually
being
killed
by
a
step
parent,
a
parent
and
a
step
parent.
however,
the
theory
of
the
statute
is
comprehensive,
and
it
takes
into
consideration
this
particular
act,
whereas--
mr.
frank
granger
--yes,
justice
kennedy.
what
i'm
saying
is--
mr.
frank
granger
--well,
my
brief,
i
would
admit,
is
not
as
articulate
as
i
would
like
it
to
have
been,
but
i
think
the
general
thought
that
i
was
trying
to
present
to
the
court
is
that
we
have
certain
conduct,
and
in
this
particular
case
the
federal...
the
congress
has
enacted
a
murder
statute
that
takes
into
account
conduct
which
is
normally
classified
as
murder,
and
that
is
specifically
the
killing
of
a
human
being.
whereas,
when
we
look
at
the
louisiana
first
degree
murder
statute,
it,
in
much
the
same
way,
has
broken
down
murder
into
first
degree
and
second
degree
to
take
into
consideration
various
persons,
statuses,
or
crimes
committed
within
the
perpetration
or
attempt
to
perpetrate
another
crime,
just
like
the
first
degree
murder
statute
in...
that
congress
adopted.
however,
what
louisiana
has
done
is
sought
to
enforce
punishment
through
the
differentiation
of
the
types
of
murder.
whereas
in
first
degree
murder
you
have
either
a
death
penalty
or
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
and
in
second
degree
murder
you
have
life
in
prison
without
parole.
however,
the
conduct,
or
the
act,
is
the
killing.
i
think
it's
a
fairly
specific
thing
that
we
can
all
realize
and
agree
upon
that
is
what
murder
is,
is
the
killing
of
a
human
being.
mr.
frank
granger
justice
souter,
yes,
i
believe
that's
what
i'm
getting
at,
but
i
think
i'm
trying
to
make
it
in
a
different
way.
what
i'm
trying
to
propose
is
simply
a
clear
reading
of
the
statutes,
because
it
appears
to
me
that
it's
fairly
clear
that
congress
has
taken
over
the
field
of
murder,
especially
after
1909,
as
it
applies
to
any
act
which
has
occurred
upon
a
military
reservation,
or
any
act
under
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court.
mr.
frank
granger
yes,
sir.
mr.
frank
granger
i
do
agree
with
that.
mr.
frank
granger
justice
ginsburg,
i
would
think
that
that's
more
closely
compatible
to
my
analysis
of
the
statutes,
and
i
would...
if
i
had
to
concede
a
point,
i
would
concede
that
that
is
more
likely
to
be
an
appropriate
acceptance
of
the
way
the
statute
should
work,
because
under
the
louisiana
cruelty
to
a
juvenile
statute
it
covers
not
only
cruelty
but
also
it
covers
neglect,
so
then
you
have
a
different
area
than,
say,
the
federal
assault
statute,
where
we
deal
with
the
actual
striking
of
someone
under
the
age
of
16
or
something
of
that
nature.
but
there
again,
we
see
the
difference.
the
chord,
or
the
common
chord
that
goes
through
these
cases,
at
least
in
my
way
of
thinking,
is
the
fact
we
have
a
killing,
and
congress
has
said,
as
far
as
it
goes
to
killing,
we've
decided
what
is
first
degree
murder,
we
have
decided
what
is
second
degree
murder.
now,
louisiana,
you
can
decide
whatever
you
want
is
murder
under
your
state
statutes,
and
you
can
apply
that
to
whomever
you
want,
as
long
as
they
are
your
citizens
or
persons
in
your
state,
but
when
it
comes
to
prosecuting
this
crime
on
federal
property,
in
federal
courts,
for
an
offense
against
the
united
states,
then
we're
going
to
look
at
what
we
decide
murder
is
and
so
as
not
to
get
too
far
afield--
mr.
frank
granger
--you
would
not
have
to
look
further
for
the
definition
of
murder.
you
would
look
only
to
the
federal
murder
statute,
not
to
any
louisiana
statutes
dealing
with
murder,
yes.
mr.
frank
granger
yes,
justice
ginsburg,
because
when
we...
when
i
looked
at
this
court's
previous
ruling
in
williams
back
in
1946,
the
issue
there
really,
the
way
i
sum
it
up,
is
that
you
have
a
competing
state
and
federal
statute.
the
federal
statute
chose
in
that
case
to
draw
the
elements
of
the
crime
more
narrowly,
the
age
of
consent
being
16,
whereas
the
arizona
statute
chose
to
make
the
age
of
consent
18,
and
this
court
held--
mr.
frank
granger
--that
we
cannot
allow
a
state
statute
to
somehow
enlarge,
broaden,
or
redefine--
mr.
frank
granger
--justice
o'connor,
i
agree
with
that
approach,
except
that
i
think
in
a...
the
case
of
a
murder
versus
the
case
of
carnal
knowledge
versus
statutory
rape
the
precise
act
can
only
be
one
act,
and
that--
mr.
frank
granger
--if
i
had
to
choose
i
would
say
it's
more
like--
mr.
frank
granger
--i
think
we
have
to
look
at
what
conduct
is
being
proscribed
and
whether
the
statute,
whether
it
be
the
federal
assault
statutes
or
whether
it
be
a
louisiana
cruelty
to
a
juvenile
statute,
or
any
state
statute
that
deals
with
batteries
or
cruelty
to
a
juvenile,
addressed
the
actual
conduct
which
is
being
prohibited.
there
is
that
gray--
mr.
frank
granger
--i
would
think
that
if
it's
specifically
beating
of
a
child,
that
more
than
likely
it
would
be
assimilated,
and
it
has
been
assimilated
under
other
circuit
courts.
however,
i
think
we
also
have
to
understand
that
assault
statutes
as
written
are
generally
very,
very
broad,
and
they're...
and
they
cover
a
wide
range
of
acts,
and
in
fact
they
could
also,
as
far
as
the
cruelty
to
a
juvenile
statute
in
louisiana--
mr.
frank
granger
--but
in
the
louisiana
scheme
work
i
believe,
justice
o'connor,
that
what
we're
talking
about
is,
there
is
a
killing
of
a
child,
and
what
we're
looking
now
at
is
the
way
that
louisiana
defines
murder
from
first
degree
to
second
degree.
that
is
not
really
the
issue,
i
think,
before
this
court.
the
issue
before
this
court,
has
congress,
through
the
federal
murder
statute,
defined
this
crime
and,
if
so,
we
don't
go
to
a
state
statute
in
order
to
give
us
a
different
burden
of
proof,
to
give
us
different
elements
of
the
crime,
or
to
give
us
different
sentences.
we
look
only
to
the
federal
statute.
and
i
think
that's
what
makes
those
type
of
cases
much
different
than
assault
cases,
or
burglary
cases,
or
cases
where
you
have
a
long
range
or
a
wide
range
of
different
actions
that
can
be
specifically
narrowed
down.
mr.
frank
granger
i
think
that--
mr.
frank
granger
--no,
justice
scalia,
i
disagree
with
that,
because
i
think
that
we
have
two
different
things.
one
is
an
assault,
which
does
not
mean
there
is
a
killing.
you
can
have
an
assault
and
there
be
no
death.
mr.
frank
granger
and
clearly--
mr.
frank
granger
--no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
we
need
to
look
at
those
words
because--
mr.
frank
granger
--the...
i
know
of
none,
justice
o'connor,
that
has
given
it
that
interpretation.
but
i
think
the
issue
here
is
that
when
we
talk
about
something
such
as
an
assault,
which
is
a
very
different
statute,
differently
written
than
a
murder,
and
especially
the
way
that
the
federal
congress
has
defined
murder
in
this
case,
that
it's
kind
of
like
mixing
apples
and
oranges
together,
because
assaults
do
not
entail
murder,
or
necessarily.
you
could
have
an
assault
in
which
someone
dies,
and
then
you
may
be
charged
with
both
crimes,
but,
of
course,
the
murder
would
be
more
inclusive
of
the
actual
assault
on
the
person.
mr.
frank
granger
justice
kennedy,
i
believe
that
is
the
appropriate
way
to
look
at
this
case,
because
when
williams
grappled
with
this
issue
a
long
time
ago
we
were
dealing
with
situations
in
which
you
had,
i
guess,
less
federal
criminal
legislation
than
you
have
now.
but
even
back
then
we
had
the
murder
statute,
and
more
importantly,
the
case
was
directed
at
the
conduct
that
was
being
prosecuted,
and
the
prosecution
of
a
murder,
whether
it
be
a
person
under
the
age
of
12,
as
in
louisiana
first
degree
murder,
or
a
person
over
the
age
of
12,
it
is
the
murder,
that
is
the
act
and
the
conduct
that
we
have
to
look
at.
and
the
issue
then
becomes,
if
congress
has
chosen
to
prosecute
that
particular
type
of
conduct
in
a
certain
way,
then
it
would
be
impermissible
to
allow
the
assimilation
of
a
state
statute
which
may
define
it
differently,
or
may
prosecute
it
differently,
or
may
have
different
elements
of
the
crime
to
merely
come
in
to
change
this
federal
statute.
congress,
if
it
so
chooses,
can
change
the
statute.
it
can
change
it--
mr.
frank
granger
--yes,
justice
stevens,
because
clearly
if
you
look
at
the
murder
statutes
any
other
murder
than
those
which
are
enumerated
is
going
to
be
murder
in
the
second
degree.
now,
of
course,
in
federal
court,
or
in
the
federal
criminal
code
we
do
have
voluntary
and
involuntary
manslaughter
statutes,
but
i
think
that's
what
congress
is
saying,
is
that
we're
specific--
mr.
frank
granger
--yes.
mr.
frank
granger
if
i
understand
your
hypothetical
correctly,
justice
stevens,
if
there
were
no
premeditate
or
malice
aforethought
element--
mr.
frank
granger
--then
certainly
that
would
be
a
different
type
of
crime.
mr.
frank
granger
i
think
you
would
have
to
in
that
particular
instance,
because
what
we're
discussing
is--
mr.
frank
granger
--i
think
that--
mr.
frank
granger
--and
maybe
i
understand
the
error
of
my
ways.
mr.
frank
granger
i
think,
justice
stevens,
what
i
would
look
at
is
that,
depending,
i
guess,
if
we
do
have
crimes
that
may
be
crimes
under
federal
law
that
are
not
crimes
under
state
law,
and
clearly
we
have
crimes
under
state
law
which
are
not
crimes
under
federal
law,
whether
these
apply
or
don't
apply
is
based
on
whether
they
occur
on
federal
property
or
not,
so
if
congress
said
that
we're
not
going
to
have
any
of
these
murders
and
we're
not
going
to
allow
these
murders
to
be
prosecuted,
then
i
guess
you
could
not
prosecute
that
person
for
that
type
of
murder.
but
if--
mr.
frank
granger
--they've
just
omitted
it,
but
then,
i
guess,
then
the
prosecution
would
be
for
the
lowest
element
of
murder
under
federal
law,
which
would
be
included
within,
say,
the
higher
type
of
murder
that
you're
describing,
which
is
with
premeditation,
or--
mr.
frank
granger
--well,
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
raised
another
issue
in
cert
which
was,
of
course,
denied,
so
in
that
particular
respect
the
second
degree
murder
conviction
found
by
the
fifth
circuit
would
also
be
affirmed.
however,
the
sentence
that
was
imposed,
or
at
least
allowed
to
stand
by
the
fifth
circuit,
would
need
to
be
vacated
and
the
matter
remanded.
mr.
frank
granger
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
yes,
because
that
issue
was
not...
cert
was
not
granted
on
that
issue
and
it's
not
properly
before
the
court.
however,
i
would
assume
that
if
this
court
thought
that
that
issue
needed
to
be
raised
it
could
on
its
own
do
so.
but
in
this
particular
circumstance,
no.
the
only
issue
i
have
here
is
if
you
agree
that
the
assimilative
crimes
act
does
not
apply,
then
the
only
remedy
my
client
has
is
a
remand
to
the
fifth
circuit
to
vacate
the
sentence
it
imposed,
and
then
remand
the
matter
to
the
district
court
for
resentencing
in
accordance
with
the
guidelines,
which
is
basically,
as
i
understand
the
government's
brief--
mr.
frank
granger
--they
conceded--
mr.
frank
granger
--and
i
think
that
that
is
really
the
appropriate
measure
in
this
case.
the--
mr.
frank
granger
--justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
it
would
apply
because
the
federal
statute
would
have
encompassed
both
those
acts,
because
feticide
is
actually
another
form
of
killing,
and
therefore
it
would
be
covered
by
the
federal
murder
statute,
as
any
other
crime
which
is
not
first
degree
murder
is
second
degree
murder.
so
you
may
have...
you
would
have
the
murder,
obviously,
of
the
mother,
and
then
as
far
as
whether...
and
this
is
the
question
i
don't
know
the
answer
to,
whether
the
federal
murder
statute
would
allow
such
a
claim
for
an
unborn
child,
then
i
don't
have
the
answer
to
that.
if
it
does,
you
would
have
to
say
two
counts
of
murder.
if
not,
you'd
only
have
one
count.
mr.
frank
granger
justice
souter,
i
believe
it's
clearly
an
analytical
test
because
the
intent
issue
clearly
is
covered
within
the
federal
murder
statute
if
you're
thinking
of
criminal
intent,
whether
it
be
premeditated
or
with
just
malice
aforethought.
however,
in
that
respect
it's
an
analytical
test
because
the
murders...
we're
not
looking
to
what
state
law
describes
as
to
what
intent
should
apply,
whereas
in
louisiana
in
this
particular
case
you
only
have
the
issue
of,
for
first
degree
murder
under
louisiana
law,
a
specific
intent
to
kill,
or
specific
intent
to
inflict
great
bodily
harm,
the
death
of
the
person,
and
the
person
being
under
the
age
of
12.
so
it's
strictly
analytical,
because
we
don't
look
to
whether
another
state
or
a
state
statute
would
describe
the
intent
required
to
meet
the
definition
of
the
crime.
we
look
at
whether
federal
law
covers
the
act,
and
then
federal
law
itself
then
describes
what
intents
are
requisite
for
what
purposes,
whether
it
be
first
degree
murder,
second
degree
murder,
or
voluntary
or
involuntary
manslaughter.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
frank
granger
i
think
the
question
really
is,
the
louisiana
statute
really
is
more
a
death
penalty
statute
than
merely
an
attempt
to
particularly
define
child
killing,
but
i
think--
mr.
frank
granger
--not...
no,
sir,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
granger
no,
but
i--
mr.
frank
granger
--because
of
the
fact
that
you
have
to
bring
the
punishment
along
with
the
crime.
mr.
frank
granger
correct.
mr.
frank
granger
i
agree
with
you,
justice--
mr.
frank
granger
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
justice--
mr.
frank
granger
--i
would
think
so,
justice
breyer.
also,
i
think
that
if
we
look
at
18
u.s.c.
3551
it
also
allows
the
bringing
in,
even
though
it
may
be
an
assimilated
state
crime,
you
have
to
look
at
the
guideline.
mr.
frank
granger
3551,
your
honor.
mr.
frank
granger
because...
what
it
does,
justice
scalia,
is
that
if
you
have
an
assimilated
state
crime,
you
then
have
to
look
at
the
guideline
that's
most
analogous
to
that
particular
crime.
mr.
frank
granger
and
i
think
that--
mr.
frank
granger
--i
don't
think
i
can.
mr.
frank
granger
it
may
be
the
latter,
justice
scalia.
mr.
frank
granger
correct.
mr.
frank
granger
correct,
but
justice
souter,
more
importantly,
i
think
what
gives
me
pause
is
that
the
argument
of
the
government
then
states
that
people
are
subjected
to
two
different
jurisdictions.
well,
if
you're
on
a
federal
enclave,
i
don't
think
you
really
are
subjected
to
state
law.
you're
subjected
to
federal
law
for
a
federal
crime
on
a
federal
enclave,
so
the
inquiry
is,
and
what
it's
always
been
when
we're
dealing
with
these
kind
of
cases
is,
has
congress
enacted
a
law
that
prescribes
or
punishes,
makes
punishable
this
conduct?
if
it
has,
you
don't
need
to
look
to
state
law.
otherwise,
what
we're
going
to
have
is
50
states
and
numerous
military
reservations
all
over,
and
then
the
u.s.
attorney
is
going
to
be
forced
to
say,
well,
louisiana
defines
it
a
little
bit
differently
here,
so
i'm
going
to
use
louisiana
law.
what
happens
to
the
federal
law?
is
it
even
necessary
any
more?
why,
then,
has
congress
chosen,
even
in
the
1940's,
to
reenact
the
assimilative
crimes
act
to
say
we
don't
have
to
keep
reenacting
this
act.
any
time
congress...
and
this
is
what
sharpnack
was
saying.
any
time
congress
makes
a
new
enactment
it's
automatically
going
to
be
brought
over.
it's
going
to
preempt
the
field.
it's
going
to
cover
the
area.
we
don't
have
to
get
into
this
argument
every
single
time
that
congress
chooses
to
do
something.
