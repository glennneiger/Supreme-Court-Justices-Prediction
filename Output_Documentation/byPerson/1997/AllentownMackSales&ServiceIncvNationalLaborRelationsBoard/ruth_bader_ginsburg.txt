justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--are
you
making
two
distinct
arguments,
and
is...
one,
as
i
hear
it,
seems
to
be
purely
comparative.
that
is,
suppose
the
board
said,
we're
simply
not
going
to
allow
unilateral
withdrawal.
that's
too
risky.
so
all
we
have
is
the
poll
and
what's
been
called
the
rm
election.
suppose
we
took
out
what
you
say
is
a
glaring
inconsistency
in
no
more--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--yes.
then
what
would
your
case
be,
if
we
had
only
the
poll?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
i
still
don't
have
a
clear
answer
from
you
to
my
question.
to
the
extent
that
you're
complaining
about
a
comparison
being
irrational,
isn't
that
objection
at
least
taken
away
if,
say,
the
board
was
to
respond,
they
said,
fine,
we've
always
been
nervous
about
these
unilateral
withdrawals.
we
just
won't
allow
them
any
more.
suppose
you
didn't
have
that
in
your
case,
and
all
you
had
was
the
poll
and
the
rm
election
governed
by
the
same
standard,
would
you
have
any
complaint?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
sorry,
now
you're
losing
me.
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
thought
i
understood
your
first
argument
that
if
they
didn't
permit
unilateral
withdrawal,
you
would
not
have
a
complaint,
but
now
you
seem
to
be
saying
even
if
they
didn't--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--then
why
couldn't
the
board
say,
this
is
our
test
and
we
want
it
to
be
a
tight
one
because
it's
important
to
give
the
union
a
chance
to
operate,
and
that's
why
we
have
the
1-year
free,
and
then
we
have
the
rebuttable
presumption.
so
to
keep
that
tight
we
have
to
have
a
stringent
standard
of
what
we
must
show
before
we'll
let
you
get
an
election
or
take
a
poll.
what
would
be
illogical
about
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
board's
rule
is
you
have
to
have
more
than
a
doubt.
is
that
what...
tell
me
what...
you
seem
to
be
saying
that
that
would
not
be
a
permissible
construction
of
the
statute.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
good
faith
doubt
doesn't
come
from
the
act.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
shawe,
maybe
i
don't
remember
the
record
right,
but
i
thought
that
the
alj
had
said,
but
even
if
it's
that
lower
standard
that
the
other
courts--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that...
i
don't
even
find
that
low
threshold.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you
give
us
the
board,
in
the
board's
own
words,
something
more
than
this
formula,
good
faith
reasonable
disbelief,
some
place,
some
statement
by
the
board
where
it
spells
out
what
it
means?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
just
by
using
those
words,
not
telling
us
in
any
more
detail,
what
exactly
those
words
mean.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
which
is
what
has
been
recommended,
and
how
long
has
this
chelsea
case
been
pending
before
the
board,
where
this
rethinking
in
this
area
has
been
proposed?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it's
over
a
year.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
you
have
no
indication
of
when
it
would
be
decided.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
said
in
your
brief
that
if
the
court
disagrees
with
your
position
that
this
is
all
right
just
to
approve
what
the
board
has
ruled,
that
we
should
remand
to
let
the
board
do
what?
what
would
happen
in
this
case?
that's
what...
i
didn't
follow
your
argument.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
if...
but
as
far
as
this
particular
employer
is
concerned,
if
that
employer
was
subjected
to
an
irrational
scheme,
then
there
is
no
unfair
labor
practice.
am
i
missing
something?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
you--
--assuming--
--in
order
to
retain
that
option
of
the
unilateral
withdrawal
and
treat
it
the
same
way
as
a
poll.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and...
why
does
it
permit
it,
and
under
the
same
standard
as
the
poll?
number
1,
why
does
it
permit
it
at
all,
and
second,
if
it
permits
it,
why
doesn't
it
have
a
much
tighter
standard
for
that?
