chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-795,
allentown
mack
sales
and
service
v.
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
shawe.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
understood
your
claim
to
be
here...
if...
perhaps
it's
a
claim
of
irrational...
that
the
board's
requirements
for
taking
a
poll
are
so
stringent
that
they
almost
make
a
poll
unnecessary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nuechterlein.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
not
mr.
nuechterlein,
mr.
shawe.
mr.
nuechterlein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
doubt...
i
simply
don't
understand
the...
your
statement
that
doubt
means
disbelief.
doubt
may
lead
to
a
state
of
mind
that
further
investigation
would
produce
disbelief,
but
doubt
i
don't
think
anywhere
is
equated
with
disbelief.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
board--
--well,
why...
what
is
it
that
gives
the
board
the
authority
to
prevent
an
employer
from
taking
a
poll
unless
it
meets
his
conditions?
i
mean,
aren't
there
first
amendment
problems
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
employer
cannot...
is
forbidden
from
asking
his
employees
whether
they
want
to
continue
to
support
a
union?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
does
the
national
labor
relations
act
supersede
the
first
amendment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
the
free...
the
commercial
free
speech
doctrine
was
a
good
deal
different
in
1968,
or
whenever
it
was
that
gissel
packing
came
down,
and
the
way
it
is
today.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
actual
malice
came
from,
you
know,
3
or
400
years
of
common
law
judges,
and
it's
been
cleared
up
now
by
a
lot
of
revised
statutes,
but
the
board
surely
can't
depend
on
that
sort
of
an
accretion
for
simply
changing
the
meaning
of
something.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
employer
can't
go
out
and
ask
himself,
and
if
the
board
is
skeptical
of
views
retailed
by
third
parties,
then
what
kind
of
evidence
can
the
employer
use?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
the
board
has
said
we
will
allow
a
poll
if
there's
a...
the
reasonable
doubt
showing,
but
certainly
there's
got
to
be
some
counter
to
it.
that
can't
just
be
an
empty
thing,
and
yet
it
seems
that
the
board...
if
it
won't
allow
the
employer
to
go
out
and
ask,
and
it
doesn't
accept
the
kind
of
evidence
that
you
just
referred
to,
it's
almost
a
fiction
to
say
the
employer
can
ever
meet
that
standard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nuechterlein.
the
case
is
submitted.
