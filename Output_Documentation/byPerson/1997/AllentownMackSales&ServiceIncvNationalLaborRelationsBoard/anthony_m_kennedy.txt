do
you
have
to
say
it's
irrational
before
this
court
can
rule
in
your
favor,
or
can
you
say
that
it's
inconsistent
with
the
board's
precedents?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why...
can
you
tell
me
why
this
is
inconsistent
with
the
board's
precedents?
is
it
primarily
because
of
the
definitional
content
that
we
ought
to
give
to
the
reasonable
doubt
standard?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
doesn't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
doesn't
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
also
apply
to
withdrawal
of
recognition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well
then...
then
shouldn't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--the
standard
for
a
poll
and
withdrawal
of
recognition
be
the
same?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
okay.
why?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
there
any
theory
you
can
advance
to
tell
us
that
that
should
constitute
good
faith
doubt
in
the
context
of
taking
the
poll,
even
though
it
might
not
be
for
withdrawal
of
recognition?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
why
was--
--the
board
has
recognized
the
utility
of
informal
polls,
has
it
not?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
it
seems
to
me
somewhat
inconsistent
to
say
that
you
can't
conduct
a
poll
until
you
know
the
answer.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
then
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
way
that
you've
been
applying
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
just
as
an
evidentiary
matter
to
protect
himself
against
the
board?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
so
this
is
kind
of
a
purging
exercise.
it's
not
an
informative
exercise.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it's
just
a
way
for
the
employer
to
objectively
demonstrate
that
it
has
goodwill
toward
the
employees.
is
that
the
point?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
thought
the
point
was
that
it
is
a
truly
informative
one
so
that
the
employer
is
not
subjected
to
unfair
labor
practice
when
it
takes
the
further
step
of
withdrawing
recognition,
which--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
ought
to
do
if,
in
fact,
the
union
does
not
represent
a
majority
of
employees.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
we've
established
that
the
board
has
found...
i
think
you've
indicated
that
there
is
a
utility
to
that
device.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
are
there
restrictions
on
the
holding
of
elections
that
are
more
severe
or
more
onerous
than
on
taking
of
polls?
there's
a
contract
bar
rule,
for
instance.
aren't...
can
you
take
a
poll
more
often
than
you
can
have
an
election?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
are
the
formal
restrictions
on
elections
that
do
not
apply
to
the
informal
polls?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
contract--
