mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
picking
up
on
the
commentary
in
curtin
matheson,
this
case
brings
to
the
court's
attention
the
issue
of
whether
deference
to
the
board
is
owing
when
the
board
applies
the
same
standard
to
three
different
approaches
to
challenging
a
union's
continuing
majority
status.
in
curtin
matheson
this
court
acknowledged
the
board's
oft-articulated
standard
that
an
employer
can
withdraw
recognition
from
an
incumbent
union
if
1)
the
union
has
in
fact
lost
its
majority
status,
or
2)
the
employer
has,
based
on
objective
considerations,
reasonable
grounds
to
doubt
the
union's
continued
majority
status.
the
second
test
supposedly
can
be
satisfied
by
a
lower
threshold
of
proof,
although
the
board
typically
requires
clear,
cogent,
concise
articulations
by
individual
employees
disaffected
totalling
a
majority,
or
a
head
count.
but
conducting
a
secret
ballot
poll
is
not
the
same
as
withdrawing
recognition.
obviously,
in
the
withdrawal
of
recognition
the
employer
has
preempted
any
vote.
in
contrast,
a
secret
ballot
poll
assuming
fairness
consistent
with
the
board's
struksnes
standards
permits
of
the
possibility
that
a
majority
will
vote
in
favor
of
continued
union
representation,
and
the
board
in
texas
petrochemicals
and
its
brief
disclaims
any
interest
or
desire
to
do
away
with
employer
polls.
the
board's
standard
for
permitting
an
employer
to
take
the
grave
and
precipitous
step
of
withdrawing
recognition
should
not
at
the
same
time
be
applied
in
the
contradictory
context
of
secret
ballot
polling.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well,
i
don't--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--no,
i
don't...
i
think
it's
not
rational,
given
the
predisposition
of
the
board...
the
court,
me,
the...
everyone,
that
a
poll
or
an
election
is
a
much,
much
better
preferred
test
to
measure
employee
sentiment
than
what
is...
what
has
been
for
40
years
the
board's
articulated
standard
in
celanese
that
an
employer
can
withdraw
without
a
poll.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well,
they
make
it
irrelevant,
a
legally
irrelevant
act,
the
board's
regulatory
scheme
that
accepts
as
valid
a
secret
ballot
poll
only,
and
only
if
the
employer
has
so
much
evidence
before
taking
the
poll
that
it
could
have
withdrawn
recognition
without
it.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well,
i
suppose
a
reasonable
doubt,
if
it
were
different
from
a
head
count
and,
indeed,
it
were
applied
as
if
it
were
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
perhaps
the
complaint
wouldn't
be
so
vehement,
but--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--yes,
i
think
it
would
be
irrational
to
mandate
the
same
requirement--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--for
a
withdrawal
of
recognition
without
a
poll,
because--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--because
what
the
board
has
elevated,
has
valued
in
allowing
an
employer
to
withdraw
recognition
with
or
without
a
poll
because
the
same
standard
applies,
or
even
processing
the
favored
rm
petition,
the
management
petition,
is
a
head
count,
and--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--without
a
head
count.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
that's
clearly
a
complaint,
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--but
i
don't
think
the
test
should
determine
the...
should
be
dependent
on
the
risk
factor.
i
don't
think
the
risk
factor
is--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--well,
the
reason
that
it's
irrational,
i
suggest,
is
that
it
is
internally
inconsistent.
it
is...
it
encourages
conduct
that
should
be
discourages.
it
encourages
conduct
to
withdraw
recognition
without
any
poll,
board
or
employer-conducted,
and--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--no.
i
think
that
the
reason
that
the
board
is
insisting
on
it
is
that
they
are
nervous
about
withdrawals
of
recognition,
appropriately
so,
and
would
prefer,
as
they
have
acknowledged,
and
all
would
agree,
that
the
rm
petition
be
utilized
as
the
standard,
and
what
they
have
done
is,
i
think
mistakenly
in
u.s.
gypsum,
after
20
years
of
not
doing
it
in
1966
said
we
are
going
to
have
the
same
elevated
standard
for
processing
an
rm
petition
as
we
have
to
permit
an
employer
to
withdraw
recognition
without
any
poll
whatsoever,
and--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--i
think
inconsistent
with
the
board
precedent.
i
think
either
one.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes.
i
think
the
reasonable
doubt
standard,
as
articulated
by
the
board
in
celanese,
and
reiterated
even
in
the
1990's
cases--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--is
a
totality
of
circumstances
test,
which
they
fail
to
apply.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes,
of
course,
and
indeed
the
board's
general
counsel--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--shouldn't
we
have--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--no.
they
should
be
different.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
because
a
poll
presumes
that
employees
will
fairly
express
their
sentiments.
the
withdrawal
of
recognition,
the
poll,
the
secret
ballot,
which
is
certainly
the
truest
test
of
employee
sentiments,
has
been
preempted
completely.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
it
should,
but
it
hasn't
been.
it
surely
should
because
of
the...
the
withdrawal
of
recognition
is--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--i
agree.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well,
i'm...
i'm--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--right.
i'm
afraid
that
if
the
reasonable
doubt
standard
that
the
board
has
applied
is
accepted
by
the
court
as
a
head
count,
that
i
won't
prevail
in
this
case.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
no
more
withdrawals?
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well,
if
the
board
continued
to
adhere
to
its
elevated
standard
to
process
an
rm
petition,
then
i
would
continue
to
insist
on
the
employer's
right
to
conduct
the
poll.
if,
however,
the
board
accepted
its
own
general
counsel's
recommendation
in
the
chelsea
industries
case...
that
was
one
of
the
cases
lodged
by
the
board
in
opposition
to
our
cert
petition.
the
board's
general
counsel,
who's
obviously
much
more
familiar
with
this
process
than
currently
anyone
else,
has
himself
indicated...
and
i
have
the
lodging
where
he
says
that,
on
page
9,
the
board's
current
policy,
which
applies
the
triple
standard
to
the
rm
petition,
to
the
poll,
and
to
the
withdrawal
of
recognition
without
any
election,
the
board's
current
policy
does
little
to
encourage
employers
to
act
in
accordance
with
what
the
supreme
court
has
long
thought
to
be
the
board's
own
view,
namely
that
even
after
the
certification
year
has
passed,
the
better
practice
is
for
the
employer
with
doubts
to
keep
bargaining
and
petition...
the
rm
petition...
the
board
for
a
new
election,
citing
the
ray
brooks
case,
the
1954
case
that
the
supreme
court
heard
after
the...
after
reading
the
celanese
decision.
so
rather,
says
the
general
counsel
to
the
board,
rather
the
celanese
rule,
which
he
is
proposing
be
eliminated...
that's
your
suggestion...
encourages
employers
to
engage
in
self-help
measures,
and
thereby
to
engage
in
potentially
unlawful
withdrawal
of
recognition
rather
than
the,
quote,
better
practice
of
proceeding
to
a
board
vote
with
the
injuries
to
industrial
peace
and
protracted
litigation,
which
is
always
the
result--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--no.
i'd
have
a
lot
less
complaint,
but
in
my
view
the
rm
petition,
in
order
to
make
it
available,
must
be
subscribed
to
in
a
much
lower
standard
than
the
one
that's
currently
in
place,
which
does
require
still
a
head
count
in
order
for
the
board--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--right.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
if
they
do
not
honor
what's
called
a
good
faith
doubt,
which
is
a
totality
of
the
circumstances,
still
required
a
head
count
applicable
to
the
rm
petition,
and
the
conduct
of
a
poll
before
the
poll
would
be
validated,
yes,
i
would
still
object
because
the
good
faith
doubt
would
be
obliterated
within
the
meaning
of
what
those
words
mean,
at
least
what
the
court
has
always
assumed
the
board
to
have
meant
when
it
registers
good
faith
doubt.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well,
the
reason
for
that
is
that
it
seems
to
me
the
best
way
to
resolve
a
doubt
is
to
have
a
poll
rather
than
to
require
the
employer
to
submit
evidence
in
advance--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--that
would
not
be
a
permissible
construction
of
good
faith
doubt,
correct.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
no,
it
comes
from
the
board,
and
if
the
board
says
that
a
good
faith
doubt
standard
will
apply
to
rm
petitions
and
to
polls,
then
the
head
count
would
be
impermissible
as
the
test
to
determine
whether
or
not
either
the
poll
or
the
rm
petition's
processing
should
go
forward.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
based
on
the
six
or
seven
employees
credited
by
the
board
claiming
disaffection
from
the
union,
several
other
statements
from
other
employees
not
accepted
by
the
board,
but
nonetheless
indicating
a
lack
of
interest
or
support
for
the
union,
the
statement
of
a
night
shift
employee
who
said,
all
five
or
six
night
shift
employees
do
not
favor
the
union
and,
most
importantly,
the
comment
by
ron
mohr,
the
shop
steward
and
union
committeeman,
who
says
to
the
employer
that,
with
you
as
the
boss,
the
new
company,
if
a
vote
were
taken,
the
people
would
not
support
the
union.
i
don't
think
the
people
want
the
union
with
you
as
the
boss.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes,
because
the...
what
the
board
has
articulated
as
elevated,
as
favored,
are
individual
names.
had
mr.
mohr
said,
and
here
are
the
names
of
the
people
that
i
think
would
vote
against
the
union,
the
board
would
prefer
that.
they'd
like
that.
but
that's
a
remarkable
elevation
when
everyone
would
agree
that
a
better
resolution
of
true
employee
sentiment
would
not
be
mr.
mohr's
articulation
of
here's
the
list
over
here,
and
here's
the
list
over
here,
but
rather
to
allow
all
the
people
vote
in
secret,
and
that's
what
happened
here.
they
voted
in
secret.
there
is
a
specific
finding
that
there
was
a
noncoercive
setting,
that
the
union
had
notice,
the
union
lodged
no
protest
over
the
vote,
nor
made
any
comment
concerning
it.
all
the
employees
participated.
i
can't
imagine
a
better
test
of
true
employee
sentiment--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--than
the
poll
that
was
conducted
here.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
this
court's
acknowledged
it
in
the
fall
river
case.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
that
industrial
stability
is
an
important
policy
so
long
as
it
doesn't
unduly
interfere
with
employee
choice.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well,
you
know,
one
of
the
things
that's...
constantly
crops
up
in
the
board's
brief
is
the
issue
of
remand,
because
both
you
and
justice
ginsburg
now
assume,
let's
assume
we
don't
have
withdrawals
of
recognition
for
the
moment,
without
a
poll,
which
is
clearly
not
the
rule.
it
may
be
a
wise
rule,
but
it's
not
the
rule,
and
when
they
apply,
the
board
applies
to
the
polling
standard
and
the
rm
standard
the
same
standard
that
they
would
apply
to
an
employer
without
any
election,
to
do
exactly
the
same
thing,
and
just
litigate
the
case
for
a
couple
of
years,
is
exactly
the
reason
why
the
board's
current
standard...
i
don't
want
to
suggest
you
set
it...
needs
rethinking,
relooking,
not
inconsistent
with
its
own
general
counsel's
approach--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--yes,
sir.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
no,
i
think...
i
beg
to
differ.
i
don't
think
they
discredited
it
at
all.
i
think
they
believed--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--yes.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes,
so
that
the
fact
that
he
said
it--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--has
been
credited.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
but
the
weight
that's
to
be
attached
to
it--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--absolutely.
if
you're
going
to
weigh
what
a
good
faith
doubt
is,
i
cannot
imagine
that
you
would
ignore
that.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
oh,
no,
i
don't
mind
arguing
with
those
reasons.
the
reason...
one
reason
that
the
board
gave
is
that
there
was
no
way
to
verify
what
he
said.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
well,
number
1...
as
for
that,
as
to
the
predecessor
business,
this
court--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--and
the
board
says,
we
presume
the
same
degree
of
sentiment
for
the
union
to
a
successor
as
we
do
a
predecessor,
or
lack
of
sentiment,
i
suppose.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
the
same
rule
applies.
number
2,
as
i
remarked
on
before,
it
is
true
that
i
didn't
know...
no
one
would
know
with
certainty
that
mr.
mohr
was
accurate.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
sure.
absolutely.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
j&j
drainage
is
the
best
case
that
i
can
find.
it's
one
cited
by
them,
and
the
only
distinction
between--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--there's
no--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--the
only
reason
they
advanced
is,
that
shop
steward
was
talking
about
the
successor's
employees.
mr.
mohr
had
not
yet
come
over,
so
they
were
talking
about
the
predecessor's
employees.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
he
was
the
shop
steward
for
some,
but
he
was
on
the
union's
negotiating
committee,
and
again,
i
think
what's
going
on
is
a
splitting
of,
you
know,
hairs.
it's
a
real
strain
to
say,
when
the
owner
of
the
company
hears
from
the
union
committeemen
and
shop
steward
that
i
don't
think
that
the
employees
with
this
new
company
would
want
a
union,
if
we
had
a
vote
i
think
they'd
reject
it--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--for
him
to
parse
that
out
and
say,
that's
not
good
enough,
especially
when
it's
accompanied
by
all
the
other
individual
statements
and
the
commentaries
of
others
that
says,
we
don't
want
the
union.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
in
my
opinion--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--that's--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--because--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--the--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--well,
what's
unreasonable
about
it
is
that
the
employer
is
required
to
bargain
with
a
majority
union
under
section
9(a)
and,
as
a
result,
a
whole
litany
of
cases
have
come
out
about
how
you
test
the
union's
majority
status
in
a
successor
case
like
mine.
a
reasonable
good
faith
doubt
of
the
union's
majority
status
is
supposedly...
that's
articulated
by
the
board
and
this
court
as
the
standard,
and
it
does
not
require
a
head
count
if
the
good
faith
doubt
is
to
have
any
common-sense
meaning,
or
commonplace
meaning
of
what
those
words
are.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
yes,
it's
possible.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
that's
right,
and
doesn't
give
me
the
benefit
of
it.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
that's
correct,
and
commentator
joan
flynn,
who's
been
cited
by
both
parties
as,
you
know,
a
person
who's
written
extensively
on
this
subject
and
who
was
cited
by
the
court
in
the
curtin
matheson
case,
says
exactly
that,
that
they
do
not...
do
not
apply
the
good
faith
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
any
way,
in
any
common
sense
way,
and
apply
it
to
a
head
count
standard.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
exactly.
but
in
response
to
your
question,
what...
it
seems
to
me
internally
inconsistent
if
you
continue
to
allow
a
withdrawal
of
recognition
without
a
vote.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
but
if--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--well,
let
me
tell
you
what
the
board
explains
as...
in
its
own
brief,
which
is
that
many
employers,
as
you
said,
acting
in
good
faith,
and
wishing
to
convey
that
good
faith
to
their
employees,
would
not
wish
to
withdraw
recognition
from
a
union
unless
they
could
first
confirm
whether
or
not
the
union
in
fact
lacks
majority
support,
and...
right,
and
polling
is
one
method
of
making
that
determination.
that's
exactly
what
i
did
here.
it's
exactly
what
i
did.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
they
didn't--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--they
didn't
find
i
didn't
have
good
faith
doubt.
they
found
that
i
didn't
have...
i
found
six
people
that
said
individually
i
don't
want
the
union,
or
seven.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
and
ignored...
crediting
but
ignoring
any
weight--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--i
think...
i
think
this
court
has
the
right
and
the
obligation
to
say
that
good
faith
doubt
articulated
by
the
board
must
be
applied--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--fairly.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
no,
of
course
not.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
you
wouldn't
find
enough.
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
correct,
and
the
reason
that
he
didn't
find
a
low
threshold,
and
the
board
articulated
the
same
thing,
is
that
they
only
considered
it
in
conjunction
with
the
six
or
seven
that
were
specific
articulations
of
union
disaffection,
and
in
either
case,
the
high
threshold
or
the
low
threshold,
no
one
is
contending
that
six
or
seven
is
enough
for
anything,
and
what
they've
done
in
the
high
threshold
and
the
low
threshold,
the
board
and
the
alj,
is
to
ignore
completely
what
weight
to
attach
to
mr.
mohr
or
to
the
other
statements
to--
mr.
stephen
d.
shawe
--thank
you.
