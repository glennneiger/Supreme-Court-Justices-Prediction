justice
david
h.
souter
well,
why
is
it
contradictory?
i
mean,
i
thought
there
was
a
rational
structure
for
all
of
this
along
the
following
lines:
the
board
says,
we're
at
the
point
at
which
the
presumption
is
no
longer
absolute.
the
employer
in
effect
is
going
to
be
given
three
options,
subject
to
the
same
condition,
probable
cause
to
believe.
the
three
conditions,
the
three
options,
however,
have
varying
risks.
if
the
employer
simply
withdraws
recognition
and
turns
out
to
be
wrong,
the
repercussions
are
presumably
going
to
be
very
great.
if
the
employer
asks
for
an
election,
perhaps
the
repercussions
may
not
be
so
great,
but
they're
going
to
be
serious.
if
the
employer
decides
to
take
a
poll,
the
repercussions...
and
loses,
the
repercussions
perhaps
will
not
be
quite
so
great.
that's
not
quite
so
disruptive.
what
is
irrational
about
saying,
subject
to
the
same
fact
premise,
the
employer
is
going
to
be
given
an
option
of
going
a,
b,
or
c,
depending
on
the
degree
of
risk
that
the
employer
wants
to
run
if
the
employer
turns
out
to
be
wrong?
justice
david
h.
souter
how
is
that
irrational?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
are
you
saying
that
if
the...
if
the
standard
of
cause
that
were
applied
to
each
of
these
three
options
were
something
less
than
what
you
characterize
as
the
head
count,
that
there
would
be
nothing
irrational,
nothing
to...
nothing
really
to
object
to
in
having
the
three
options
subject
to
the
same
factual
condition?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
would
it
be...
would
the
scheme
be
irrational?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
but
you
may
have
a
gripe
with
the
board
that
they
set
it
up
that
way,
but
that's
a
very
different
thing
from
saying
that
it's
irrational
to
the
point
that
a
court
would
be
authorized
to
strike
it
down.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
it
does
that
because
they,
as
you
put
it
they
are
insisting
on
a
head
count.
isn't
that
the
reason?
justice
david
h.
souter
mr.
shawe--
justice
david
h.
souter
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
shawe,
isn't
one
answer
to
the
objection
that
you're
making...
which
i
have
to
say
in
the
mohr
example
is
i
think
a
very
serious
objection,
but
isn't
one
answer
to
it
this:
sure,
the
best
way
to
find
out
what's
really
going
on
is
to
have
an
election.
we
agree.
but
we
want
the
standard
for
calling
the
election
to
be
high.
we
want
the
standard
of
doubt
to
be
a
high
one
because
there's
another
value
involved,
and
the
fact
is
the
promotion
of
industrial
peace
and
the
promotion
of
stability
is
going
to
be
served
over
the
long
haul
by
fewer
elections
rather
than
more
elections,
and
that's
why
we're
going
to
have
a
high
standard,
maybe
not
to
the
point
of
requiring
mohr
to
say,
a,
b,
c,
d,
and
e
told
me,
but
at
least
to
the
point
of
requiring
mohr
to
say,
i
have
actually
talked
to
the
men,
not
naming
them,
and
i
find
that
they
are
affirmatively
disclaiming
any
desire
at
this
point
to
continue
with
the
union.
we
want
the
high
standard
because
we've
got
this
other
interest
that's
being
served.
that
may
be
a
good
policy,
it
may
be
a
bad
policy,
but
isn't
it
a
permissible
policy
choice?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
isn't--
justice
david
h.
souter
--yes,
and
what
is
unduly
interfering
is
the
problem
here,
what
unduly
means,
and
whether
it
would
have
been
your
policy
choice
or
my
policy
choice,
isn't
it
within
the
realm
of
reason
for
the
board
to
have
made
the
policy
choice
that
it
made
in
requiring
a
starchier
standard
than
perhaps
would
have
been
necessary
from
the
literal
meaning
of
the
words?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
maybe
it
does,
but
that's
a
step
away
from
the
kind
of
irrationality
upon
which
invalidity
has
to
be
predicated,
isn't
it?
mr.
shawe,
may
i
ask
you,
in
judging
you
claim
that
there
was
inadequate
evidence
to...
that
there
was
plenty
of
evidence
to
show
good
faith
doubt,
you
relied
in
part
on
the
testimony
of
this
man
mohr.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
i
suppose
i
am
troubled
by
the
idea
that
the
standard
is
the
same
for
a
poll
and
withdrawal
of
recognition.
petitioner's
counsel
doesn't
seem
to
give
me
much
help
there.
it
does
seem
to
me
that,
from
the
standpoint
of
a
sensible
interpretation
of
the
act,
when
we're
concerned
with
having
the
least
disruption
of
the
employee-union
relation,
that
the
polls
are
not
treated
differently.
justice
david
h.
souter
may
i
just
go
back
to
something
specific
for
a
second?
i...
now,
the
petitioner's
exhibit
a
is
the
treatment
of
mohr's
testimony
here.
i
meant
to
ask
this
question
to
your
colleague.
at
the
time
mohr
made
his
statement,
which
the
board
discounted,
was
there
a
question
as
to
whether
mohr
would
be
hired,
whether
he
would
be
among
the
32,
or
whether
he
would
be
let
go?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
of
course,
the
board
didn't
discount
it
on
that
basis
though,
did
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
--what
would
the
board's
result
have
been
if
in
this
case
mohr
had
said,
i
have
personally
and
specifically
talked
to
12
employees.
they
all
say
that
they
would
vote
against
the
union
today,
and
i've
been
around
long
enough
so
that
i
am
satisfied
that
if
an
election
were
held
today,
the
majority
support
for
the
union
would
be
gone.
would
that
have
been
enough
for
the
board...
would
have
have
been
enough
for
reasonable
doubt--
justice
david
h.
souter
based
on
what
it
has
said,
could
you
answer
my
question
with
assurance
one
way
or
the
other?
