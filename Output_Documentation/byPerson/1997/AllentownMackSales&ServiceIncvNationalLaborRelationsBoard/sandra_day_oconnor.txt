justice

o'connor
hasn't
the
board
held
in
other
cases
that
the
employer
or
that
the
board
itself
should
rely
on
statements
of
shop
stewards?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
are
your
best
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
would
they
have
treated
this
steward's
testimony
differently
than
they
do
in
other
cases?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
the
board
also
allows
an
employer
to
call
an
election,
call
a...
take
a
poll
if
the
employer
has
a
reasonable
doubt--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--about
the
employee
support.
i
think
that's
what
we're
talking
about.
the
board
seems
to
articulate
as
its
standard
here,
and
maybe
it
doesn't
have
to
set
that
standard,
but
it
purports
to
say
a
reasonable
doubt
will
suffice.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
fact
it
is
in
practice
asking
for
something
more
than
that.
that's
what
troubles
me,
and
there
is
an
unbroken
line
of
cases
where
the
board,
although
mouthing
some
reasonable
doubt
standard
is,
in
fact,
calling
for
something
more.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they
have
to
know
the
answer
by
a
head
count
before
they
say
it
will
justify
polling
the
employees,
and
it's
just
such
a
bizarre
case
here,
where,
in
fact,
the
poll
shows
of
course
there
was
a
reasonable
doubt.
there
was
more
than
that.
there
wasn't
any
support.
so
i
mean,
it's
just
a
very
strange
posture.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
board
is
using
it
like
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
[laughter]
i
thought
the
standard
was,
a
reasonable
doubt.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
give
me
any
case
since
1984
where
the
evidence,
other
than
express
repudiations
by
a
majority
of
the
employees,
supported
a
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
the
board's
view.
any
case
since
'84.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
fact,
it
just
applies
some
other
standard.
it...
that's
not...
that's
not
reasonable.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
board
has
to
be
up
front
about
what
it's
doing,
and
it's
not.
it
adheres
to
this
reasonable
doubt
standard
but
applies
a
different
standard.
what
purpose
at
all
would
employer
have
to
try
to
conduct
an
employee
poll
if
the
standard
is
exactly
the
same
in
practice
as
for
unilateral
withdrawal
of
recognition
by
the
employer?
that
in
fact
is
what's
going
on.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
may
be,
but
the
board
has
nonetheless
articulated
this
policy,
and
we
have
to
determine
whether
it's
being
applied
rationally
or
not.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
what
is
the
status
of
the
chelsea
industries
case
that's
pending
before
the
board?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
months--
--and
we
were
hearing
quotes
read
from
the
general
counsel's--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--representations
to
the
board
in
that
case,
which
do
seem
somewhat
contrary
to
what
you're
telling
us
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
the
board
said
they
had
to
have
a
good
faith
reasonable
doubt.
you
keep
articulating
the
standard
as
something
else.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
really
thought,
and
i
want
you
to
answer
whether
i'm
correct,
that
the
board's
standard
is
a
good
faith
reasonable
doubt.
now,
are
those
the
words
that
we
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
why
do
you
keep
answering
as
though
it's
something
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and,
in
fact,
the
board
is
in
practice
applying
a
different
standard.
that's
what
you're
telling
us.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
seem
to
take
the
position
that
what's
required
for
unilateral
nonrecognition
of
the
union
and
calling
for
a
poll
of
the
employees
is
virtually
the
same
thing,
and
yet
in
the
auciello
case
from
this
court,
which
isn't
that
old,
this
court
said
that
the
evidence
required
to
demonstrate
that
a
union
has
lost
majority
support
is
greater
than
that
required
to
assert
good
faith
doubt.
we
purported
to
auciello
to
lay
out
what
this
tripartite
framework
is
and,
in
fact,
it's
being
applied
as
a
two-part
framework.
