mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
justice
breyer
has
suggested,
once
employers
have
decided
to
engage
in
collective
bargaining
and
have
settled
on
a
union
to
represent
them,
the
national
labor
relations
act
prescribes
only
two
ways
of
testing
whether
that
union
continues
to
command
majority
support.
first,
the
employees
themselves
whose
interests
are
most
directly
at
stake
here
may,
upon
a
showing
of
interest
by
30
percent
of
the
bargaining
unit,
petition
the
board
to
hold
a
decertification
election.
alternatively,
the
employer
may
itself
petition
the
board
to
hold
an
election
if
it
can
present
a
reasonable,
solid
basis
for
believing
that
the
union
has
lost--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--justice--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--justice
o'connor,
i
have
a
couple
of
answers
to
your
question.
first,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
the
term,
reasonable
doubt,
does
not
mean
here
what
it
would
mean
in
the
criminal
law
context.
the
board
develops
its
policies
and
process--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--to
the
contrary,
justice
o'connor.
the
board's
standard
means
the
employer
must
have
a
solid,
reasonable
basis
for
believing
that
the
union
has
lost
majority
support.
the
board
is
not
using
the
term
doubt
here
to
mean
uncertainty.
it
is
using
that
term
to
mean
disbelief.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i...
i'd
be...
the
board--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--justice
scalia,
the
board
has
to
develop
its
policies
in
the
course
of
adjudication,
and
in
the
course
of
adjudication
i
think
the
board
has
been
quite
candid
that
this
is
a
tough
standard
and
is
difficult
to
meet.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
justice...
mr.
chief
justice,
the
term
doubt
does
have
two
different
meanings.
one
of
them
means
vague
uncertainty,
and
that
is
the
way
in
which
we
use
it
in
the
criminal
law
context.
i
think
the
board
has
been
quite
clear
that
that's
not
what
it
means
when
it
uses
the
term.
here,
doubt
means
disbelief,
and
what
the
employer
has
to
show
is
a
solid
basis
for
believing--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i...
i...
this
is
how
the
board
uses
the
term--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--and,
to
the
extent
it's
become
a
term
of
art,
it's
not
confusing
to
anyone
because
the
board
is
quite
candid
about
the
rigor
of
the
standard
that
it
applies
here.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
justice
scalia--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--what
the
board
requires--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--it
does
in
the
following
sense.
what
the
board
requires
is
the
employer
to
show
good,
hard
evidence,
whether
through
a
head
count
or
through
probative
circumstantial
evidence
that
the
union
has,
in
fact,
lost
majority
support.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i've
two
responses,
justice
scalia.
first,
the
board
does
not
require
a
head
count.
we've
enumerated
a
number
of
cases
in
our
brief
in
which
the
board
has
relied
upon
probative--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
in
1993
the
board
again
reaffirmed
its
prior
precedent
and
continues
to
reaffirm
those
pre-1985
cases.
i'm
not
personally
aware
of
any
cases
since
1984
in
which
that
has
happened,
but
the--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--the...
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
one
is,
first,
acknowledging
that
this
is
a
term
of
art,
just
as
actual
malice
is
a
term
of
art.
the
board
i
think
has
been
quite
candid
over
time
about
how
tough
the
standard
is
to
meet,
but
remember
that
the
important
question
here
is
whether
the
board's
standard
is
rational,
and
all
that
it
takes
for
the
standard
to
be
rational
is
that
there
be
circumstances
in
which
some
employers
might
profit
from
taking
a
poll
even
if
they
did
meet
the
evidence
for
a
standard
for
withdrawal.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
the
board
has
determined
that
polling
is
sufficiently
disruptive
that
it
is--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--that
is
something
that
the
national
labor
relations
act
places
principally
on
the
employees.
it
is
their
principal
role
to
look
after
their
own
interests,
and
if
they
want
to
throw
off
the
union,
they
themselves
have--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
don't
understand
there,
first
of
all,
to
be
a
first
amendment
issue
in
this
case,
because
petitioners
have
never
raised
it
at
any
point
in
these
proceedings.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
but
beyond
that,
in
gissel
packing
this
court
pointed
out
there
are
special
concerns
that
exist
in
the
workplace
that
forbid--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
i
think
that
the
basic
premise
of
gissel
continues
to
be
true.
in
the
workplace
certain
forms
of
speech
may
be
subject
to
government
regulation
that
could
not
be
subject
to
such
regulation
in
the
outside
world.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
again,
justice
scalia,
the
substance
of
the
standard
has
to
be
understood
in
the
context
of
how
it's
applied,
and
i
don't
think
the
board
has--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--the
board
has
in
past
cases
described
its
standard
as
rigorous,
as
stringent.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
to
be
sure,
i
mean,
in
this
context
no
matter
what
the
standard
the
board
picks,
that
standard
is
going
to
be
fact-specific
in
its
application,
and
it's
not
possible
to
give
a
global
explanation
for
how
it's
applied
in
every
case.
sometimes
a
head
count
is
enough,
sometimes
it's
required
because
the
employer
has
no
especially
probative
circumstantial
evidence
in
order
to
make
its
case,
but
the
board
has
also
reaffirmed
circumstantial
evidence
is
available
as
a
basis
for
establishing
this
evidentiary
predicate
in
some
cases.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
it
has.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
first--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
want
to
address
the
premise
of
your
question,
because
i
think
it's
very
important
here.
even
if
the
board's
standard
is
quite
high,
it
is
nonetheless
the
case
that
often
an
employer,
even
if
he
thinks
he
has
a
head
count,
will
nonetheless
want
to
take
a
poll
to
confirm
what
he
believes
he
knows.
remember
that...
this
case
is
a
good
illustration
of
that.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
not
just
that.
i
think
the
board
is
entitled
to
believe
that
many
employers
act
in
good
faith
and
want
to
know
truly
what
their
employees
believe,
and
also
want
to
give
those
employees
a
sense
of
involvement
in
that
employer's
unilateral
decision
whether
or
not
to
withdraw
recommendation
later.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
no,
i
think
it's--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
think--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--justice--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
polling
serves
both
of
those
purposes
when
it's
cabined
to
the
narrow
circumstances
in
which
it's
particularly
likely
to
reveal
a
loss
of
majority
support
for
the
union.
it
is...
it
both
gives
employees
a
sense
of
involvement
in
the
employer's
later
decision,
but
also
it
serves
an
informational
purpose.
think
of
this
case.
the
information
that
this
employer
got
about
the
views
of
his
employees
came
in
over
time
through
weeks
and
months
through
disparate
sources,
sometimes
second
or
third
hand.
also,
employers
realize
that
employee
support
for
a
union
is
not
static,
and
employee
support
for
a
union
may
fluctuate
over
time.
that
employer,
if
he's
acting
in
good
faith
and
wants
to
know
what
his
employees
really
believe,
will
want
to
schedule
polls
so
that
they
can
think
about
the
issue
with
cooler
heads
and
then
get
together
on
one
day
and
decide
whether
or
not
they
want
to
keep
the
union.
that
is
so
even
if
the
board's
requirement
requires
a
head
count,
which
is
something
that
we
claim
it
does
not
do.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
remember
the
act
says
nothing
about
either
polling
or
unilateral
withdrawals
of
recognition.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
there
is
utility
to
the
device,
but
the
employer
also
if
he
wants
to
avoid
litigation
is
free
on
the
same
showing
to
request
what's
called
an
rm
election,
which
is
a
board-sponsored
election
that
the
employer
requests,
but
the
backdrop
of
all
of
this
is
that
the
act
places
on
the
employees
and
not
on
the
employer
the
primary
responsibility
to
take
the
initiative
to
decide
whether
they
still
support
the
union
that
they
themselves
have
chosen.
that
is
what
industrial
stability
requires.
it's
the
employees
who
picked
this
union
and,
over
time,
it's
the
employees
who
have
the
primary
responsibility
for
determining
whether
or
not
they
should
stick
with
it.
it
is--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--that
is
correct,
and
my--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--it's
my
understanding
that
that's
still
pending.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
correct.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
the
general
counsel
has
asked
the
board
to
abolish
the
policy
permitting
employers
to
unilaterally
withdraw
recognition
from
the
union,
and
so
what's
he's
proposing
is
an
altogether
different
scheme.
what
petitioners
are
proposing
is
that
the
board
keep
its
current
standard
and
also
be
subject
to
a
different
substantive
standard
for
polling,
but
our
submission
is
that
so
long
as
the
board
permits
both
unilateral
withdrawals
of
recognition
and
polling,
the
only
requirement
is
that
there
be
some
marginal
utility
to
polling.
it
is
true
that
the
board
could
altogether
abolish
polling
if
it
wanted
to
do
that,
but
i
acknowledge
that--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i'm
not
sure
of
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
know
that
it's
been
pending
since
last
spring
when
we
filed
for
opposition.
i
don't
know
how
long
before
then.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
do
not,
justice--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
ordinarily
when
a
court
determines
that
an
agency's
administrative
scheme
is
irrational,
the
proper
course
is
to
remand
to
the
agency
to
determine
what
would
be
a
rational
scheme
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i'm
not
sure
that's
true
in
the
context
of
adjudication,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
bell
aerospace.
it
is
permissible
for
the
board
to
adopt
its
policies
through
the
vehicle-specific
cases,
and
it
would
be
the
board's
role
in
the
first
instance,
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
food
store
employees,
to
determine
whether
any
new
policy
could
fairly
be
applied
retrospectively
to
these
petitioners.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
the
record
is
unclear
on
that.
i
think
that
the
answer
is
yes,
there
is
a
question
about
that.
as
i
understand
the
sequence
of
events
there
were
two
different
conversations
that
the
alj
relied
on
when
discussing
mohr's
statements.
the
first
was
his
conversation
with
petitioner's
president,
mr.
dwyer.
the
second
was
a
conversation
mr.
mohr
had
with
the
supervisor
in
the
course
of
an
interview.
i
think
that
is
the
correct
order.
it
was
in
the
course
of
that
first
conversation
that
mr.
mohr
gave
what
petitioners
claim
was
the
evidentiary
showing
that
reached
the
standard.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
it
did
not,
although
i
think
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
board
pointed
out
that
with
respect
to
mohr's
statements
in
the
second
interview
it
was
important
to
consider
both
that
this
was,
in
fact,
a
successorship
situation
where
employees
may
in
fact
feel
insecure
about
their
future
state,
status
in
the
company,
and
also
in
the
job
interview
that
mohr
had
he
was
told
by
the
supervisor
that
the
company
would
be
nonunion.
that
is
in
the
alj's
opinion.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
the...
as
a
general
matter
the
board's
policy
would
prohibit
an
employer
from
walking
up
to
employees
point
blank
and
asking
them
directly
whether
they
still
support
the
union.
there
is
a
case
law
on
this,
and
in
some
circumstances
the
board
will
not
find
that
to
be
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
there
are
particular
reasons
to
think
that,
for
example,
it's
just
a
casual
remark
and
no
harm
is
done.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
the--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
again,
the
test--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--what
the
employer
must
have
is
a
solid
basis
for
believing
the
union
has
lost
majority
support.
they
can
establish
that
either
through
a
head
count
or
through--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
like
actual
malice--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--those
are
the
words
that
the
board
uses.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
and
it
is
the
board's
shorthand--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--because
what
the
standard
is
is
determined
by
how
the
board
applies
that
standard
through
the
process
of
adjudication--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--no.
the...
i...
in
other
words,
the
board
is
not
making
any
pretense
of
using
a
liberal
standard
when,
in
fact,
it
has
confirmed
that
this
is
a
rigorous
standard
and
difficult
to
meet.
just
like
actual
malice,
the
term
that
the
board
uses
for
this
test
is
a
shorthand,
and
people
in
the
industry
know
what
the
shorthand
means
and
know
how
to
satisfy
it.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i
agree
with
that,
but
these
are
not
statutory
words.
they
are
the
board's
own
words
and,
like
other
shorthands,
they
have
to
be
understood
through
the
lens
of
the
board's
application
of
the
standard.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
no,
i
don't
believe
i
said
certainty.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
a
head
count
as
petitioners
describe
it
would
be
evidence
that
comes
in
through...
perhaps
for
a
long
period
of
time
through
many
disparate
sources,
sometimes
second
or
third
hand,
that
suggest
that
particular
employees
were,
at
the
particular
moment
that
they
said
something
about
the
union,
inclined
not
to
support
the
union.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--it
is
a
tough
standard.
it's
not
the
same
as--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--here's
why
it
makes
sense.
if
there's
one
principle
that
this
court
has
observed
continuously
over
the
years,
it
is
that
we
should
rely
on
the
employees
themselves
rather
than
on
their
employers
to
take
the
initiative
in
second-guessing
whether
or
not
the
union
that
the
employees
have
chosen
should
continue
to
exist
in
the
workplace,
and
it
is
true
that--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--yes,
you
have.
you...
in
auciello
and
fall
river,
in
brooks,
this
court
has
pointed
out
that
the
people
that
we
principally
rely
on
to
rebut
the
presumption
of
continuing
majority
status
are
the
employees
who
have
chosen
this
union.
in
some
circumstances
the
employer
may
have
evidence
that
would
give
him
the
right
either
of
withdrawal
recognition,
take
a
poll
or
conduct
an
rm
election,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
confers
on
the
employers
an
additional
collateral
right
to
go
out
and
seek
more
evidence
to
try
to
withdraw
recognition
from
a
union.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i...
what...
the
primary
question,
as
i
understand
your
question,
is
why
does
the
board
still
permits
unilateral
withdrawals
of
recognition,
given
that
you
have
the
rm
election
device,
or
is
your
question
something
else?
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
well,
the
answer
to
your
first
question
is,
it's
largely
a
question
of
historical
evolution
of
the
labor
laws.
it
was
not
until
the
taft-hartley
act
of
1948
that
there
were
rm
elections
and/or
that
there
were
decertification
elections.
those
were
added
by
that.
before
then,
effectively
the
only
way
that
a
union
could
ever
get
decertified
was
if
an
employer
withdrew
recognition,
and
because
of
that,
the
board--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
single
case
in
which
any
employer
has
been
found
guilty
of
a
violation
of
section
882
by
virtue
of
that,
because
in
fact
what
he
has
to
have
is
incontrovertible
evidence.
if
he
has
a
doubt
about
that,
though,
the
important
thing
is
that
he
can
go
to
the
board
and
seek
an
rm
election
if
he
wants
to
preserve
his
rights.
he
doesn't
have
to
have
unilateral
action.
congress
has
provided
the
specific
remedy
for
him.
the
fact
that
the
board
hasn't
foreclosed
altogether
alternative
unilateral
remedies
that
the
employer
might
also
take
doesn't
require
the
board
to
give
a
wide
birth
to
those
unilateral
remedies.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
is
correct.
on
this
record,
the
proper--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--that
is
correct.
on
this
record
the
proper
people
to
challenge--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--justice
o'connor,
the...
this
court
in
auciello
didn't
address
the
difference
between
the
standards
required
in
the
withdrawal
context
and
the
polling
context.
what
it
addressed
are
the
two
standards
that
permit
an
employer
to
take
any
action,
any
unilateral
action
at
all,
and
those
are
a
demonstration
of
actual
loss
of
majority
support,
and
what
the
board
has
called
reasonable
doubt.
no
one's
arguing
about
the
first
of
those
in
this
case.
what
we're
arguing
about
is
whether
it's
rational
for
the
board
to
apply
the
same
reasonable
doubt
standard
in
the
polling
context
as
it
is
in
the
withdrawal
context,
and
the
reason
it's
rational
is
because
there
are
some
contexts
in
which
a
good
faith
employer
might
benefit
from
taking
a
poll
even
if
he
thinks
he
has
some
sketchy
information
suggesting
the
majority
of
employees
no
longer
support
the
union.
in
that
context,
it
makes
a
lot
of
sense
for
him
just
to
maintain
workplace
goodwill
to
take
the
poll
before
going
the
extra
yard
and
withdrawing
recognition.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
there
are
not
the
same
formal
restrictions
on
repeated
polls,
but,
of
course,
if
the
employer
takes
a
poll
and
it
turns
out
that
the
union
wins,
it
will
require
some
new
development
in
the
workplace
for
an
employer
to
develop
a
new
reasonable
basis--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--the
primary
one
is
the
one
that
you
just
identified,
which
is
that--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--as
a
statutory
matter
you
may
not
take
a...
you
may
not
conduct
a
new
election
within
1
year
of
the
prior
election.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
it's
hard
for
me
to
speak
for
the
board.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
that
would
be
a
different
case.
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
i'm
not
sure
that
i
could
answer
your
question
with
assurance
one
way
or
the
other.
i
do
know
that
the
board
requires
a
particularly
strong
showing
of
nonsupport
for
a
union,
and
the
board
is
naturally
skeptical
to
rely
on
certain
kinds
of
evidence,
and
reports
of
colleagues'
views
in
the
workplace,
and
the
reason
it
is
is
that
often
when
these
views
trickle
up
to
the
employer
they
are
the
result
of
a
concerted
effort
by
some
of
the
employees
to
throw
out
the
union.
remember
that--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--well,
again,
there
will
often
be
the
case...
there
will
often
be
circumstances
in
which
the
employer
will
not
have
a
sufficient
evidentiary
basis,
and
that
that's
the
circumstance
in
which
the
board
has
put
the
burden
on
the
employees
to
look
after
their
own
rights
in
filing
a
decertification--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--no,
i
think
it
reflects
the
board's
empirical
understanding
that
no
union
will
ever
have
majority
support.
in
an
initial
organizing
context
elections
are
held
and
sometimes
a
sizeable
minority
of
employees
don't
support
the
union.
those
may,
in
fact,
be
the
very
same
employees
who
are...
who
1
year
later,
2
years
later,
give
reports
to
the
employer
that
the
union
has
lost
majority
support,
and
the
board
is
naturally
quite
skeptical
about
the--
mr.
jonathan
nuechterlein
--i
think,
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
that
it
is
appropriate
to
be
skeptical
about
employer
efforts
to
act
as
a
worker's
champion,
and
that
is
the
board's
position.
thank
you.
