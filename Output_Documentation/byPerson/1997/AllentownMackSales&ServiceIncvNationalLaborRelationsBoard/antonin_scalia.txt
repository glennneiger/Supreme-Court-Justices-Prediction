justice
antonin
scalia
--but
suppose
the
same
standard
didn't
apply,
isn't
your
real
complaint
here
that
reasonable
doubt,
that
the
agency
says
reasonable
doubt,
but
that
you
had
reasonable
doubt
here,
but
that
would
not
suffice
without--
justice
antonin
scalia
--without
a
head
count.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
isn't
it
the
essential
complaint,
because
if
they...
if
they
treated
reasonable
doubt
as
reasonable
doubt,
you
would
have
the
three-stage
process
that
justice
souter
is
talking
about,
the
three
different
ways.
justice
antonin
scalia
reasonable
doubt,
the
head
count,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean,
be
given
different
content?
shouldn't
you
use
different
words?
i
mean,
do
words
have
no
meaning?
reasonable
doubt's
going
to
mean
one
thing
here
and
something
else
there?
i
mean,
i
take
your
complaint
to
be
rested
upon
the
fact
that
reasonable
doubt
ought
to
mean
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
now
you're
saying
reasonable
doubt
could
mean
two
different
things.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
going
to
mean
one
thing
for
this
and
one
thing
for--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
good
faith
reasonable
doubt
in
this...
you
assert
that
there
was
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
good
faith
reasonable
doubt.
justice
antonin
scalia
based
on
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what...
when
you
get--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we're
talking
here
only
about
a
doubt.
is
it
enough
to
raise
in
the
employer's
mind
a
good
faith,
reasonable
doubt--
justice
antonin
scalia
--about
whether
there
was
majority
support?
i
don't
know
if
we're
supposed
to
go
into
the
record
and
make
this
court
of
appeals
type
determination,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
possible
that
a
good
faith
reasonable
doubt
is
required
to
be
the
standard
by
law,
is
it
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
possible
that
if
the
agency
enunciated
a
more
than
tough
doubt,
probable
certainty
standard,
that
that
would
be
unlawful
under
the
act,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
board
doesn't
have
to
confront
that
problem
because
it
continues
to
enunciate
the
good
faith
reasonable
doubt
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
part
of
your
complaint
is
that
it
enunciates
it
so
that
it
can't
be
challenged
in
principle,
but
that
on
the
facts,
it
doesn't
apply
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
though
they
continue
to
enunciate
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
the
words
mean
whatever
the
board
chooses
them
to
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
a
reasonable
doubt
means
he
is
doubtful
for
good
reason
whether
the
board...
whether
the
union
has
majority
status.
what
else
could
it
possibly
mean?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
is
not
a
reasonable
doubt
standard,
then.
the
board
speaks
english,
doesn't
it?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right,
well,
even
if
we
accepted
that,
that
doubt
means
disbelief,
good
faith,
reasonable
disbelief,
is
the
only
way
you
can
have
good
faith,
reasonable
disbelief
to
conduct
a
head
count?
justice
antonin
scalia
good
faith
and
reasonable.
you
have
the
shop
steward
who
comes
in
and
says,
jeez,
you
know,
i
don't
think
there's
majority
support
for
you.
i
disbelieve
whether
this
union
has
majority
support.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
in
good
faith.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
entirely
reasonable,
and
yet
the
board
says,
no,
that's
no
good,
you
have
to
do
a
head
count.
justice
antonin
scalia
disbelief
doesn't
get
you
to
that,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you're
talking
about
something
other
than
good
faith,
reasonable
disbelief.
i
think
the
employer
in
this
case
surely...
surely
must
have
had
good
faith
reasonable
disbelief
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
here,
but
you
say
no,
we
cannot
use
this
evidence,
because
the
only
evidence
we'll
use
is
a
head
count.
well,
maybe
we've
got
to
do
a
different
standard.
stop
calling
it
good
faith
reasonable
disbelief,
and
maybe...
or,
even
worse,
good
faith
reasonable
doubt,
and
maybe
that
new
standard
you
come
up
with
will
be
litigated
in
court
to
see
whether
the
policies
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
allow
a
union
to
continue
in
place
on
the
basis
of
your
new
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
and
maybe...
maybe
a
court
would
hold
that
it
is
reasonable,
given
the
need
for
industrial
peace
and
so
forth,
not
to
let
an
employe
conduct
a
poll,
although
normally
you
would
think
people
can
ask
people
questions
and
get
answers.
that's
the
way
this
society
works,
by
virtue
of
the
first
amendment.
but
it's
reasonable
to
prevent
the
employer
from
disrupting
industrial
peace
unless
he
has
a
good
faith
reasonable
doubt
about
the
union's
majority
status.
that's
quite
possible,
and
perhaps
for
that
reason
the
board
has
gone
along
with
this,
but
in
fact
it
is
not
using
a
good
faith
reasonable
doubt.
if
it
is
using
another
standard,
it
ought
to
enunciate
that
standard
so
we
can
see
whether
that
standard
complies
with
the
necessity
for
industrial
peace
and
with
the
first
amendment.
justice
antonin
scalia
good
faith
reasonable
doubt.
[laughter]
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
thought
it
was
an
unfair
labor
practice
for
an
employer
to
continue
to
bargain
with
a
union
that
he
knows
no
longer
represents
the
majority.
can
he
continue
to
deal
with
a
union
that
he
knows
is
not
supported
by
a
majority
of
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
skepticism
can
go
so
far,
but
i
doubt,
frankly,
whether
the
board
could
totally
say,
union
cannot
be
eliminated
unless
you
get
30
percent
of
the
employees
to
come
in
and
throw
it
out.
i
think
there
is
at
least
doubt
whether,
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
the
employer
does
not
have
a
right
to
the
assurance
that
at
least
there's
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
union
represents
the
majority
of
his
employees.
don't...
is
that
not
a
consideration?
