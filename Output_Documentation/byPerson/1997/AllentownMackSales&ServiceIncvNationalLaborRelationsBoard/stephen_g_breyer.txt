justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--leaving
that
to
the
side,
is
it
the
case
that
a
group
of
workers,
a
union
who
has
been
in
business
a
long
time,
10
years
representing
the
workers,
am
i
right
that
if
30
percent
of
the
workers
want
to
have
a
new
election,
they
can
go
do
it?
all
right.
so
we're
only
talking
about
a
case
in
which
30...
there's
no
30
percent
of
the
workers
that
asked
to
get
rid
of
the
union.
so
if
30
percent
of
them
want
to
get
rid
of
it,
they
can
get
rid
of
it.
they
can
have
their
election.
so
we're
talking
about
cases,
the
union's
been
there
a
long
time,
and
there
isn't
some
group
of
workers
who
were
so
disaffected
that
they
called
for
an
election.
now,
under
those
circumstances,
what's
unreasonable
about
the
board
saying,
we
don't
want
management
to
try
to
throw
out
a
well-established
union?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
have
to
have
a
very,
very
good
reason.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
very
good
reason.
now,
if
they
have
that
very
good
reason,
called
tough
reasonable
doubt,
they
can
then
do
it,
and
as
far
as
we're
concerned
we
don't
care
whether
they
disrupt
labor
relations
by
having
a
poll,
by
calling
for
an
election,
by
refusing
to
bargain.
that's
up
to
them.
we're
indifferent.
some
will
want
to
do
the
one,
some
will
want
to
do
the
other.
but
what
we
are
interested
in
is,
they
don't
get
into
the
union
disruption
business
in
a
situation
where
the
workers
haven't
tried
to
do
that
unless
they
have
a
very
good
reason.
now,
i
either
may
or
may
not
agree
with
that
reasoning.
what
i
don't
want
to...
what
i
want
to
know
is,
what's
unreasonable
about
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
there
we
have
justice
souter.
so
he
says,
well,
you
know,
they
don't
care,
the
board,
which
route
of
the
three
you
take.
they
don't
care.
they
find
them
all
disruptive
to
labor
relations,
and
some
employers
will
want
to
do
the
one,
some
will
want
to
do
the
other.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
each
route
has
different
consequences
for
the
employer.
some
employers
would
think,
we'll
take
a
poll
first.
we
want
to
be
very
careful.
we
don't
want
to
get
the
union
to
hate
us.
others
will
think,
i'm
just
going
to
bargain.
i
don't
care
whether
they
hate
us
or
not.
that's
up
to
the
employer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
your
real
complaint
is,
you
had
the
good
faith
reasonable
doubt,
and
they
found
that
you
didn't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
your
complaint.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
are
we
supposed
to
in
this
court,
even
assuming
the
lower
courts
were
all
wrong
and
so
forth,
simply
conduct
a
review
of
the
record
to
decide
whether
that
finding
is
or
is
not
justified
on
the
basis
of
the
record?
i
thought
in
universal
camera
justice
frankfurter
said
two
cases
on
something,
two
lower
courts
on
cases
like
that,
that's
enough,
even
if
they're
wrong.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
have
to
overturn
justice
frankfurter
in
universal
camera,
who
says
on
substantial
doubt
questions
you
get
two...
you
get
the
court
of
appeals,
they're
going
to
forever
make
these
kinds
of
determinations,
we're
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
can
an
employer...
in
this
period
of
time
after
the
contract
bar
is
over
and
so
forth,
can
an
employer
ask
an
employee
whether
he
favors
the
union
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
the
only
way
in
which
the
employer
can,
in
fact,
take
any
action
is
if
he
has
objective
evidence,
objective
evidence
that
what,
that
a
majority
of
employees
no
longer
support
the
union,
but
they
haven't
asked
the
board
anything
about
it.
is
that
what
the
test
is?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
the
test,
actually?
i'm
a
little
worried.
what
is
the
test?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
think--
--what
were
you
going
to
say?
are...
you
were
going
to
say
about...
assuming...
or,
it's
like
predatory
intent
or
something.
the...
it's
a
fiction.
and
then
they
say
that
this
fiction
means
doubt,
reasonable
doubt,
but
based
on...
with
certainty
on
objective
evidence,
so
i
got
that
far.
it
sounds
a
little
difficult,
but--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
but
there's
some
word,
certainty
in
one
of
their
cases,
too,
but
i'm
not
picking
at
the
standard
for
a
moment.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
how
they
go
about
meeting
the
standard,
and
you
kept
talking
about
a
head
count.
what
is
a
head
count
if
it's
not
a
poll?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
you
have
to...
if
you
have
18
employees,
10
of
them
would
have
to
have
said,
without
the
employer
asking
them,
we
don't
want
a
union
any
more,
but
nonetheless
there
were
not
even
seven
of
them,
or
six,
that
were
willing
to
go
to
the
board
to
say
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that's
basically
the
standards.
that's
a
very,
very
tough
standard.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
then
the
question
would
be,
if
it's
that
tough
a
standard,
what
sense
does
it
make
to
say
you
have
to
know
that
your
majority
of
your
employees
really
have
terrific
reason
for
not
wanting
the
union,
but
you
can't
ask
them
for
a
poll
until
after
you
already
know
it.
that's
the
question
i
think
that
some
people
are
asking.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
excuse
me.
we've
said
that?
