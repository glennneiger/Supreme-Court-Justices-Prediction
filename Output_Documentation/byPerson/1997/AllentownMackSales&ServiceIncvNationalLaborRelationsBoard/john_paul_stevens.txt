are
you
saying
that
reasonable...
are
you
saying
that
reasonable...
excuse
me.
are
you
saying
that
reasonable
doubt
must
be
given
a
different
definition
in
the
context
of
a
poll
than
in
the
case
of
withdrawal
of
recognition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
judging
the
case,
should
we
do
so
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
hearing
examiner
discredited
him,
and
the
board
discredited
him,
and
the...
said
it
was
not...
his
testimony
was
not
reliable
and
not
entitled
to
much
weight,
as
did
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
said
it
was
not
entitled
to
much
weight.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
fact
that
he
said
it--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
whether
or
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
or
not
his
recounting
of
what
other
people
had
said
to
him
was
entitled
to
weight
is
a
matter
that
we
should
exercise
our
own
independent
judgment
on,
or
just--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
we
should
just
sort
of
ignore
the
reasons
why
the
board,
the
hearing
examiner,
and
the
court
of
appeals
gave
less
weight
to
that
testimony
than
you
think
it
should
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
not
sure
whether
he
was
referring
to
a
majority
of
the
predecessor
employer
or
this
employer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
only--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--plus
the
fact
that
he
only
supervised
one
portion
of
the
work
force.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
he...
but
the
employer
could
not
have
done
this
on
this
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
couldn't
have...
the
employer
couldn't
do
anything.
