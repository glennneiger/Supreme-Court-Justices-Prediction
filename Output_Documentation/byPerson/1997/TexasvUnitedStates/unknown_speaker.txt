unknown
speaker
if
all
that
is
true,
mr.
aguilar,
then
you
have
no
problem.
unknown
speaker
just
go
ahead
and
do
it,
and--
unknown
speaker
--so
why
are
you
here?
unknown
speaker
that
they
were?
unknown
speaker
were
always,
or
could
be?
unknown
speaker
might
be.
unknown
speaker
might
be.
unknown
speaker
they're
unwilling
to
say
that
none
of
these...
none
of
these
might
not
be?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
what
it
means?
i
mean,
i
interpret
that
to
mean
there
is
nothing
in
this
enabling
legislation,
in
and
of
itself,
that's
bad,
and
we
just
don't
want
to
say
right
now
whether,
as
it
is
later
implemented,
something
might
be
bad,
which
seems
to
me
a
sober
thing
for
the
justice
department
to
do.
unknown
speaker
we
would
probably
do
the
same
thing,
when
a
case
is
brought
before
us.
we
don't
rush
into
things
we
don't
have
to
decide.
you
asked
them
to
clear
this
statute,
and
they
say,
the
statute's
okay
with
us.
it's
just
enabling
legislation.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
aguilar,
i
share
justice
scalia's
concerns.
you
want
us
to
say
that
never,
under
any
circumstance,
under
any
implementation,
could
this
be
covered
under
section
5
of
the
voting
rights
act.
unknown
speaker
and
it
isn't
even
ripe.
it
hasn't
been
implemented.
seems
to
me
that's
all
the
attorney
general
is
saying
and,
like
justice
scalia,
what
prevents
the
state
of
texas
from
just
going
ahead
and
implementing
it?
if
somebody
thinks
there's
a
problem,
they'll
file
a
suit,
and
in
addition,
even
if
the
district
court
here
were
to
say,
fine,
i
don't
see
a
problem,
it
wouldn't
bind
private
parties.
they
could
always
file
a
suit
after
implementation.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
why
you're
here.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--you
began
by
reciting
many
of
the
things
the
trustees
can
do.
one
of
the
things
the
trustees
can
do
is
to
appoint
other
people
to
exercise
all
of
the
power
over
the
board
of
trustees
under
subsection
(9),
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
the
master
can
appoint
a
board
of
managers
composed
of
residents
that
exercises
all
the
powers
and
duties
of
the
board
of
trustees.
unknown
speaker
that's
not--
unknown
speaker
--so
you
would
submit
to
the
attorney
general
for
preclearance
any
proposal
to
invoke
the
powers
under
(9)
and
(10)?
unknown
speaker
could
you
help
me
just
a
little
bit--
unknown
speaker
--on
why
(7)
and
(8)
don't
raise
the
same
problem?
unknown
speaker
because
if
you
read
(7)
and
(8)
against
the
(e)
over
on
91a
about
all
the
things
the
management
team
and
the
master
can
do,
they
can
direct
any
action
to
be
taken,
can't
they?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
also
true
of
(9)
and
(10).
unknown
speaker
i'm
really
trying
to
ask
you
to
explain
why
you
take
one
position
on
(9)
and
(10)
and
another
position
on
(7)
and
(8).
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand
that,
but
number
1
under
(e)
is
may
direct
an
action
to
be
taken
by
the
principal
of
a
campus,
the
superintendent
of
the
district,
or
the
board
of
trustees
of
the
dist--
unknown
speaker
--they
tell
the
board
of
trustees
what
to
do.
unknown
speaker
why
is
that
different
from
(9)?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
see.
unknown
speaker
i
just
don't
read
the
statute
that
way
when
it
says
you
may
direct
under
(7),
may
direct
an
action
to
be
taken
by
the
board
of
trustees.
i
would
say
you
spend
the
money
for
the
high
school
and
not
the
elementary
school,
or
vice
versa.
unknown
speaker
but
he...
but
the
manager
or
master
could
require
that
the
budget
items
be
reallocated?
unknown
speaker
could
they
order
one
school
to
bus
children
to
another
school?
unknown
speaker
could
they
order
busing
from
one
school
to
another--
unknown
speaker
--spending
money?
why
not?
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
no--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
just
voluntarily
adopt
a
program,
we
want
to
reallocate
the
students
between
two
schools,
say.
just
say,
we
want
to
bus
the
third
grade
over
to
here
and
the
fourth
grade
back
here.
could
they--
unknown
speaker
--you
know,
sometimes
they're--
unknown
speaker
--boards
do
concern
themselves
with
where
the
children
will
go
to
school.
unknown
speaker
but
that's...
it's
fairly
speculative,
some
of
these
answers.
the
texas
courts
haven't
interpreted
these
provisions,
have
they?
unknown
speaker
so
that
just
what
the
law
does
permit
the
masters
to
do
is
really
not
clearly
established.
unknown
speaker
why
wouldn't
raising
more
money
be?
is
that
explicitly
excluded?
unknown
speaker
mr.
aguilar,
this
is
a
rather
novel
procedure
as
far
as
i
know.
has
there
been
any
other
case
where
a
state
or
covered
jurisdiction
has
sought
to
sort
of
jump
the
gun
this
way
by
bringing
a
noncoverage
claim
in
the
d.c.
district
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
aguilar,
what...
this
taking
over
the
operations
of
the
board
is
sort
of
a...
in
extremis
remedy.
it's
the
last
step.
unknown
speaker
well...
oh,
i'm
sorry.
you're
right.
(9)
and
(10)
are
taking
over,
in
your
estimation.
what
the
government
contends
might
in
some
circumstances
be
a
taking
over,
replacing
the
board
with
a
director
as
to
certain
issues,
that
only
comes
after
other
remedies
have
tried
and
been
failed,
right?
unknown
speaker
there's
six
or
seven
of
them?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
right,
draconian
is
the
word,
and
you
would
hope,
i
expect,
never
have...
never
to
have
to
use
that,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
right.
i
would
hope
so.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
guess
you
have
used
it.
but
would
you
say
for
sure
that
you
know
that
in
at
least
one
case
you're
going
to
have
to
take
over?
well,
indeed,
you
have.
unknown
speaker
texas
has
in
one
case.
unknown
speaker
we
have
some
evidence
of
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
can
you
tell
us,
what
were
the
powers
that
the
master
was
directed
to
exercise
in
this
dallas
district?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
the
master
directed
to
exercise
powers
(1)
through
(7),
or
(1)
through
(9),
or
was
it
that
specific?
in
other
words,
there's...
we're
talking
about
this
lodging
that
the
solicitor
general
made
with
us
just
a
few
days
ago
where
the
special
master
was
in
fact
appointed
for
this
district
near
dallas--
unknown
speaker
--or
in
dallas
county,
and
i
want
to
know,
was
the
master
appointed
and
was
he
specifically
directed
to
exercise
statutory
powers
that
were
specifically
listed
under
(a)(1)
through
(10)?
unknown
speaker
well,
was
he
specifically
appointed
under
(a)(7)
and
not
under
(a)(8)?
unknown
speaker
could
you,
before
you
finish,
explain
how
you
got
into
this
court?
as
i
read
the
statute
it
says,
when
a
state...
paraphrasing
it,
when
a
state
enacts
or
administers
a
measure
that
affects
voting,
then
the
state
can
go
to
the
special
three
judge
court
and
ask
for
a
declaration
that
it
doesn't
affect
voting
in
a
racially
discriminatory
way.
well,
you're
saying
this
is
a
measure
that
doesn't
affect
voting,
so
if
you
think
it's
a
measure
that
doesn't
affect
voting,
how
did
you
get
into
this
court?
how
can
you
say
to
the
court,
we
invoke
your
jurisdiction
because
we
have
a
measure
here
that
we
think
affects
voting,
but
we
want
you
to
say
it
doesn't
affect
voting.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
into
the
court
on
that
kind
of
a
theory?
unknown
speaker
why?
i
mean,
why
can't...
if
you...
maybe
you
have
some
regular
declaratory
judgment
action.
you
can
just
go
file...
i
don't
know
if
you
do
or
not,
but
i
don't
see
how
this...
how
you
get
within
this
statute
on
the
theory
that
you
don't
affect
voting.
at
least
that's
the
trouble
that
i'm
having.
i
don't
see
why
a
state...
this
seems
to
be
a
statute
set
up
for
states
that
believe
they
have
measures
that
do
affect
voting,
and
they
believe
that
those
measures
are
not
discriminatory.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
authority
or
anything
that
a
state--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
so
why
would
you
think
the
judges...
the
other
side
thinks
it
does
affect
voting,
so
you
can
understand
why
they
wouldn't
raise
it,
but
if
you're
a
judge...
you're
the
one
who's
invoking
the
court's
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say,
judge,
i
want
you...
to
tell
you
something.
we're
here
because
we
have
a
statute
that
affects
voting.
by
the
way,
we
don't.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
how...
on
those
circumstances
why
wouldn't
the
judge
say,
the
person
who's
invoked
our
jurisdiction
concedes
we
don't
have
it?
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
have
to
go
further.
unknown
speaker
how
do
we
get
around
the
statute's
language?
unknown
speaker
how
do...
my
problem
is
how
to
get
around
the
statute's
language.
unknown
speaker
mr.
aguilar,
i
think
when
i
asked
you
the
question,
has
a
pure
coverage
action
ever
been
brought
before,
you
were
candid
and
said
no,
but
hasn't
the
coverage
issue
been
tied
to
a
routine
section
5
case
where
the
district
says,
we
don't
think
this
racially
discriminates
and,
moreover,
we
don't
even
think
it
affects
voting?
that
kind
of
claim
has
been
brought.
unknown
speaker
why
couldn't
you
have
waited
till,
say,
the
first
case?
the
first
case
comes
up,
then
you
can
do
what
is
not
uncommon.
that
is,
you
say,
here's
this
case,
and
what
we
want
you
to
rule
on
in
this
case,
you'll
be
able
to
see
that
under
these,
whatever
it
is,
(7)
and
(8),
this
is
not
simply
not
now,
but
not
ever,
so
get
it
the
way
the
statute
has
worked
so
far.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
interject,
because
there's
one
thing
you
could
have
done.
you
say,
okay,
we're
going
to
be
delayed
a
little
the
first
time
we
do
it,
but
then
we'll
be
home
free,
so
you
could
have
brought
the
case
the
first
time.
the
first
time
you
were
contemplating...
whatever.
unknown
speaker
and
take
advantage
of
the
expedited
whatever
that
both
the
district
court
said
it
had
and
the
attorney
general.
unknown
speaker
no.
i
mean
the
first
time
that
you--
unknown
speaker
--had
whatever
you
had
in
that
district
near
dallas.
unknown
speaker
and
there...
it
didn't
take
a
year
or
two,
did
it,
in
the
case
that
we
have?
it
took
a
few
months.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
aguilar,
the
law
moves
slowly.
i
have
never
heard
the
argument
before
that
a
case
is
ripe
because
if
i
have
to
wait
until
it's
really
ripe
in
order
to
litigate
this
issue
it's
going
to
take
a
couple
of
years.
i
mean,
that's
not
an
argument
that
makes
the
case
ripe
now.
unknown
speaker
what
is
it
that
you
were
compelled
to
do
by
having
to
wait
until
one
of
these
horribles
actually
happened
in
order
to
litigate
it
now,
something
like
in
abbott
labs.
the
drug
company's
primary
conduct
was
immediately
affected.
they
were
put
to
the
choice
of
either
printing
on
the
labels
the
ingredients,
as
the
rule
required,
or
else
being
liable
for
an
enormous
amount
of
damages
as
well
as
penalties.
now,
that's
something
very
substantial.
what
does
it
cost
you
to
wait
until
the
thing
happens,
other
than
time?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
it's
truly
not
an
individual
freedom?
i
mean,
you're
raising
the
federalism
concern
of
the
state,
but
that
seems
to
me
no
different
from
the
individual
freedom
concern
of
the
private
citizen
who's
affected
by
a
rule,
and
the
private
citizen
has
to
wait
until
the
rule
bites.
unknown
speaker
but
there's
a
time
and
place
to
decide
that,
and
this
isn't
the
time.
if
texas
thinks
they
have
a
crisis
in
a
school
district
and
they're
going
to
appoint
a
management
team,
then
go
ahead
and
do
it,
if
you're
satisfied
it
isn't
affecting
voting.
do
it.
if
the
attorney
general
has
a
complaint,
they'll
file
it.
if
some
private
individual
has
a
complaint,
they'll
file
it.
i
just
don't
see
how
texas
belongs
here
now.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
when
you
did...
when
you
did
apparently
submit
something
to
preclearance
in
the
dallas
district
it
took
essentially
a
couple
of
months.
the
law
says
they
have
to
act
within
60
days,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
think...
i
don't
see
how
waiving
the
magic
word
federalism
alters
the
ripeness
analysis.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
aguilar.
mr.
wolfson,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
before
you
do,
i
don't
see
that
they're
truly
separate,
because
if
you're
right
about
ripeness,
then
there
can
never
be
this
kind
of
action,
because
when
it's
ripe
there
will
always
be
the
actual--
unknown
speaker
--isn't
that
extremely
hypothetical?
i
mean,
if
you
went
and
you've
done
it,
or
you've
got
the
plan
and
you
say,
please
preclear
it,
as
soon
as
you
do,
the
moment
you
do
we'll
do
it,
why
would
you
ever
want
to
engage
in
that
kind
of--
unknown
speaker
--hypothetical
exercise?
unknown
speaker
the
reason
you'd
want
to
do
it
is
you
don't
want
to
play
this
game
every
time.
i
mean,
are
you
taking
the
position
that
even
when
there
is
a...
an
actual
implementation
of
this
plan
in
a
certain
district,
the
state
of
texas
cannot
come
into
the
d.c.
district
court
and
say,
we
think
this
is
okay
because
it
is
simply
not
a
change
in
voting?
unknown
speaker
because
nothing
under
this
statute
is
a
change
in
voting.
unknown
speaker
what
about
allen?
i
mean,
that
certainly
gave
a
broader
construction
of
the
availability
of
an
action
under
this
statute
than
one
might
expect.
unknown
speaker
but
how...
what's
that
got
to
do
with
jurisdiction,
the
fact
that
there's
no
other
way
that
a
private
party
could
do
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
wolfson,
the
attorney
general
encouraged
texas
to
submit
this
new
law
to
it,
to
the
attorney
general
for
preclearance,
and
the
attorney
general
looked
at
the
first
six
categories
of
sanctions
and
said,
fine,
that's
not
the
problem.
you
can
implement
it.
now,
could
texas
have
gone
to
the
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
said,
as
to
the
first
six
sanctions,
look,
we
want
to
file
this
and
get
it
determined
right
now.
it's
not
an
implementation
of
voting
changes.
unknown
speaker
would
that
have...
would
the
court
have
had
jurisdiction
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
what
they're
arguing
for
sections
(7)
and
(8).
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
have
trouble
with
your
juris...
your
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
argument.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
the
court
just
say
it
isn't
ripe,
and
that's
the
end
of
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
can't
we?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--i
just...
i
think
your
subject
matter
jurisdiction
argument
is
very
troublesome.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
understand
the
state's
concern.
if
the
attorney
general
is
going
to
take
some
extreme
position...
maybe
not
this
attorney
general,
but
someone
in
the
future,
and
say
that
some
absolutely
innocent
law
in
a
section
5
area
nevertheless
requires
preclearance,
why
shouldn't
the
state
be
able
to
go
to
the
district
court
here
and
say,
look,
this
just
doesn't
implement
it
at
all?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
attorney
general
would
be
right
in
there
opposing
it,
because
it's
i'm
assuming
a
situation
where
the
attorney
general
is
taking
a
very
unrealistic
view
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--but
you
know,
in
allen
the
court
found
some
way.
they
said
this
was
the
only
way
this
could
be
done,
even
though
it
was
a
rather
circular
way.
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
the
case
here?
unknown
speaker
on
justice
o'connor's
hypothesis.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
let's
assume
that
the
doctrine
of
ripeness
would
prevent
many
of
this
kinds
of
suits
from
being
brought.
you're
saying
not
only
is
it
not
ripe,
but
the
district
court
simply
had
no
jurisdiction,
and
that,
i
think,
is
dubious
under
allen.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
can
you
explain
that
to
me,
because
i
had
thought
that
in
702
the
united
states
was
waiving
immunity
for
nonmonetary
claims
en
masse.
unknown
speaker
but
i
can
see
that
the
way...
although
702
is
in
the
apa,
i
didn't
think
it
was
limited
to
the
apa.
unknown
speaker
but
that
wasn't
what
was
done
in
allen.
unknown
speaker
in
allen
the
court
went
into
1343.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
mr.
wolfson,
as
i
understand
it,
even
on
your
own
argument,
if
they
had
gone
into
the
d.c.
court
and
said,
we
want
preclearance,
it's
quite
true
we
asked
for
preclearance
from
the
attorney
general
and
we
got
it
only,
as
it
were,
90
percent
of
the
way,
we're
coming
in
here
and
we're
asking
for
preclearance
100
percent
of
the
way...
i.e.
with
no
such
condition
as
this
enabling
legislation,
condition
9.
and
by
the
way,
we
also
don't
think
we're
covered.
on
your
theory,
it
seems
to
me,
they
could
have
gotten
exactly
what
they
wanted
if
they
had
in
effect
come
in
and
pleaded
in
that
form.
unknown
speaker
is...
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
because
you
said,
you
know,
if
they
come
in
and
they
ask
for
preclearance
and
then
they
say,
as
it
were,
as
an
afterthought,
by
the
way,
we
don't
think
we're
covered
at
all,
this
declaratory
issue
may
be
taken
out.
so
i
take
it
on
your
view,
the
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction
if
they
had
simply
approached
it
in
that
particularly
formal
way.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
i'm
talking
about
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
the
statutory
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
isn't
the
statutory
jurisdictional
argument
here,
then,
one
of
pure
formality?
the
only
thing
that
they
fail
to
do,
on
your
theory,
is
to
precede
their
request
for
this
declaration
with
a
statement
in
the
form,
please
preclear
this.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
ask
for
it
because
it
might
have
been
granted.
this
case
does
differ
from--
unknown
speaker
--is
the
same
as
allen
in
this
respect.
just
as
we
said
in
allen
there's
no
other
way
to
get
this,
there
is
really
no
other
way
to
be
sure
what
you're
going
to
get
is
a
declaration
that
none
of
these
things
are
within
the
act.
unknown
speaker
because
if
they
ask
for
preclearance,
if
i
were
a
district
judge
i
would
say,
why
should
i
bother
my
brains
about
this,
at
least
in
this
instance
it's
okay.
i...
why
do
i
have
to
reach
the
more
general
question?
and
that
will
happen
every
time
one
of
these
specific
requests
for
preclearance
is
given.
the
state
can
never
be
assured
that
that
case
will
be
decided
by
the
court
on
the
basis
that
this
is
simply
not
a
voting
change.
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
no,
that's
the
worst
part
of
it.
unknown
speaker
then
they'll
have
to
preclear
every
other
one
after
that.
they--
unknown
speaker
--how
can
they
make
a
judge
advert
to
the
issue
that
they
want
to
bring--
unknown
speaker
--there's
no
way
they
can.
unknown
speaker
just
before...
one
quick
second.
is
it
possible
that...
assume
they
don't
want
to
plead
it,
i
mean,
the
way
that
we
want
them
to
plead
it,
which
is
in
the
alternative,
in
which
case
they'd
come
in,
but
suppose
they
do
just
want
to
be
sure
they're
going
to
get
noncoverage,
can
they
bring
an
ordinary
declaratory
judgment
action
in
an
ordinary
court?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
but
section
5--
unknown
speaker
--the
jurisdiction
of
section
5
is
to
grant
preclearance
of
changes
in
affecting
voting.
if
your
argument
is
there
is
no
change,
why
couldn't
you
bring
that
action
to
a
single
district
judge--
--yes,
that's
my--
unknown
speaker
--it's
exclusive
as
to
changes,
but
is
it
exclusive
as
to
claims
that
there
are
no
change...
by
the
district
itself
that
no
change
has
taken
place?
unknown
speaker
but
what
you're
saying
is,
if
it's
exclusive,
then
there's
no
forum
at
all--
unknown
speaker
--for
that
kind
of
action.
unknown
speaker
only
if
they
allege
they're
making
a
change.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
case
that
was
initiated
by
the
city?
i
don't
remember.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying,
then,
that
under
lockhart
if
the...
if
the
three
judge
court
in
a
section
5
action
can
examine
whether
or
not
there
was,
in
fact,
a
change,
can
it
also
examine
whether
or
not
in
fact
the
change
affected
voting?
unknown
speaker
so,
then,
there
isn't
any
jurisdictional
barrier
here.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
state
simply
wants...
and
this
question
has
been
asked
before,
but
i'm
not
sure
i
know
your
answer.
what
if
the
court
simply
wants
a
declaration
that
these
changes
they've
made
do
not
affect
voting?
unknown
speaker
well,
under
the
declaratory...
if
section
5
doesn't
afford
it,
and
then
why
can't
you
go
into
a
single
judge
district
court
and--
unknown
speaker
--no.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
government
never
made
the
argument
in
the
district
court
that
it's
making
here,
did
it?
unknown
speaker
so
your
whole
argument's
kind
of
novel.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
just
so
unlikely
that
we'd
end
up
with
a
situation
where
a
state
wants
a
declaration
that
the
law
it
passed
does
not
affect
voting,
and
to
be
told
there
is
no
forum
in
which
to
get
that
resolved,
that
is
a
very
odd
position
to
take.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
the
law
before
they
had
declaratory
judgments
about
lots
of
things--
unknown
speaker
--that
you
just
had
to
wait,
but
since
the
declaratory
judgment
action,
that's
no
longer
true.
unknown
speaker
are
you
saying
that
the
district
is
well
advised
to
just
go
ahead
and
appoint
its
master
and
wait
to
be
sued?
unknown
speaker
they're
liable
for
attorney's
fees
if
they're
wrong,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
are
they
liable
for
attorney's
fees
if
they're
wrong?
unknown
speaker
are
the
contracts
and
the
decisions
and
the
directions
that
the
special
master
has
given
to
the
district
before
the
litigation
is
terminated
now
at
risk?
these
contracts
are
void,
or
voidable,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
you're
advising
this
district
to
go
ahead
and
implement
a
section
7
provision
without
getting
preclearance?
unknown
speaker
yes.
you
asked
them
about
six
pages
of
questions.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
think
the
district
court
can
act
any
faster?
certainly
you'd
come
in
and
say,
we
want
the
answers
to
these
questions
so
we
can
decide
whether
to
oppose
it.
unknown
speaker
you're
certainly
not
going
to
just
lie
down
in
this
one
forum
and--
unknown
speaker
--but
it
is
a
significant
burden.
if
you
read
through
the
papers,
as
justice
kennedy
pointed
out,
90
days
it
takes
to
process
one
of...
if
that's
a
typical
request--
unknown
speaker
--and
if
they
have
an
emergency
situation,
they
really
have
a
difficult
problem--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
you
a
jurisprudential
question?
you
having
raised
this
jurisdictional
issue,
do
you
think
it's
permissible
for
this
court
to
decide
the
ripeness
issue
without
first
deciding
whether
we
have
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
does
the
attorney
general
have
any
provision
for
taking
immediate
action
to
allow
partial
implementation
of
a
law
like
this
pending
its
decision
on
the
preclearance
request?
for
example,
where
the
bankruptcy
proceeding
has
been
initiated
and
people
are
in
the
school
district
trying
to
seize
assets,
and
the
kids
can't
go
to
school,
is
there
any
provision
for
the
attorney
general
to
come
in
and
say,
well
look,
we're
considering
this,
but
right
now
we're
going
to
let
you
operate
with
the
management
team
pending
our
resolution?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
rather
puzzling
and
somewhat
ironic
that
you
are
urging
that
the
state
of
texas
can
proceed,
without
any
preclearance
at
all,
to
implement
a
section
7
plan
when
you
have
gone
through
the
preclearance
procedure
in
the
wilmer
hutchins
district,
and
you
say,
well
just
go
right
ahead
and
take
your
chances,
but
you
can't
go
into
the
united
states
district
court.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
justice
department
would
say,
of
course,
go
into
the
district
court
and
we'll
answer
this
question
yes
or
no
as
to
whether
or
not
presley
and
etowah
applies
to
a
section
7
proceeding.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wolfson,
you're
working
in
the
direction
of
ripeness,
and
your
time
is--
unknown
speaker
--fleeting.
are
you
going
to
hit
ripeness
directly?
unknown
speaker
but
we
know
it
happened
once--
unknown
speaker
--so
why
can't
they
just
amend
the
thing
and
say,
look,
it
happened
to
us
once,
and
we
want
assurance
that
it
will
never
happen
again?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
one
question
that
kind
of
troubles
me
about
the...
your
position?
the
question...
it
seems
to
me
the
question
of
whether
the
appointment
of
a
management
team
or
a
master
is...
affects
voting
depends
on
what
the
management
team
or
the
master
does,
exercising...
some
of
them...
it
seems
to
me
some
of
the
things
they
do
clearly
would
not
affect
voting,
others
would,
so
i'm
not
sure
you're
going
to
have
the
ripeness
the
way
you've
described
it
until
not
only
the
management
team's
been
appointed
but
also
there's
some
idea
of
what
the
management
team
proposes
to
do
that
the
school
board
itself
would
not
have
done.
unknown
speaker
but
they're
all
going
to
be
the
totality
set
forth
in
the
statute,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
can
you
be
more
specific?
could
you
give
us,
for
example,
an
example
of
an
act
that
might
be
taken
under
appropriate
instructions,
under
7
and
8,
that
would
not
go
so
far
as
9
and
10,
but
which
would
affect
voting?
unknown
speaker
because
your
brother--
unknown
speaker
--in
effect
is
saying
there's
no
such
thing.
unknown
speaker
not
authority
that
would
go
so
far
as
9
and
10.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
does
it
work?
let's...
you're
talking
about
budgets.
unknown
speaker
can
you
give
me
a
budget
hypothesis
that
would--
unknown
speaker
--that
would
not
go
so
far
as
9
and
10?
unknown
speaker
is
it
any
way
that
it
would
be
a
de
facto
replacement
in
a
way
that
would
implicate
the
discriminatory
concerns
of
the
section
5?
unknown
speaker
how?
unknown
speaker
that's
right.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
the
choice
of
educational
policy,
reflected
in
a
budget,
can
also
be
a
reflection
of--
unknown
speaker
--of
racial
composition,
and
if
you
affect
that,
then
it
is
a
voting--
unknown
speaker
--it
is
a
de
facto
replacement
that
would
be
covered
by
5.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
argument?
