mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
for
two
reasons
we
think
the
district
court
was
not
empowered
to
decide
the
merits
of
texas'
request
for
a
declaratory
judgment
in
this
case.
first,
as
that
court
actually
concluded,
the
case
was
not
ripe
for
a
judicial
decision
in
both
the
article
iii
and
the
prudential
senses
of
ripeness
and,
second,
the
court
in
our
view
lacks
statutory
jurisdiction
to
decide
this
kind
of
case,
which
raises
only
the
question
of
coverage
under
section
5
and
does
not
actually
request
preclearance.
because
the
district
court
disposed
of
the
case
on
ripeness
grounds,
i'd
like
to
turn
to
that
issue
first.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
i
mean,
i
suppose
theoretically
if
the
state
were
actually...
if
it
were
actually
implementing
one
of
these
sanctions
and
for
some
reason
it
wanted
to
go
to
the
three
judge
district
court
and
say,
well
we...
you
know,
we
really
want
you
just
to
decide
the
issue
on
coverage.
we...
you
know,
we
don't...
because
we
don't--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think
you...
i
mean,
the
only
reason
why
i
think
you
might
is
if
there
were
evidence
of
discriminatory
intent
and
you
wanted
to
come
outside
of
section
5
by
saying
that
you
didn't
have
to...
it
wasn't
covered
at
all,
but
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--they
can
raise
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--they
can
raise...
i
think
that
if
they
invoke
the
jurisdiction...
well,
they
can
raise
that
in
the
courts
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
of
course,
they
can
actually
implement
it,
and
then...
and
then
raise
that
as
a
defense
if
a
private
party
or
a...
or
the
attorney
general
brings
an
action
under
section
5
in
a
local
district
court.
but
if
they
go...
the
way
we
read
the
statutory
jurisdiction,
if
they
go
to
the
three
judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
they
say...
if
they
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
for
preclearance
actions
they
can
also
say,
and
we
don't
think
this
is
a
change
affecting
voting,
so
we
don't
have
to
be
here,
but
that's
once
they
invoke
the
jurisdiction
of
the
district
court
in
a
properly
presented
preclearance
action.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that's
true.
i
think
that
there
are
factors,
though,
in
this
situation...
i
mean,
allen
relied
on
the
notion
that
there
was
no
other
way,
really,
that
a
private
party
could--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
in
that
case
allen
really
was
sort
of
an
implied
cause
of
action
case,
i
think,
where
the...
the
court
might
not
decide
it
on
that
way
today.
it
might
be
viewed
as
an
ex
parte
young
type
action,
or
a
section
1983
action
since
maine
v.
thibedaux,
but
at
that
time
i
think
the
court
was
saying
there
was
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
1343,
and
there
was
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
section
5,
and
then
the
court
said,
well,
looking
at
the
statute
as
a
whole
we
think
they
need
a
three
judge
court.
here
we
have--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
that
would
be
a--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
it
might.
i
think
that
would
be
what
we
call
a
preclearance
of
an
enabling...
enabling
legislation
before--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
as
to
(7)--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think...
well,
the
court
did
say
it
isn't
ripe,
and
our
view
is
that
this
court
can--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--you
can.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i'm
certainly
happy
for
the
court
to
resolve
the
issue
on
ripeness.
i
think
that...
i
do
think
that
if
texas...
first
of
all,
in
terms
of
preclearing
enabling
legislation,
we're
not
aware
of
any
situation
in
which
a
covered
jurisdiction
has
gone
to
the
three
judge
district
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
asked
for
just
enabling
legislation
to
be
precleared
before
it's
ever
been
implemented,
and
i
think
just
as--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
mean,
there
are
many
occasions...
there
are
many
occasions
on
which,
of
course,
parties
want
to
have
their
rights
adjudicated
definitively,
and
there
are
even
occasions
on
which
the
other
side
wouldn't
mind
having
that
done,
determined
by
the
courts.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right,
but
the
fact
is
that
in
our...
in
a
system
of
the
federal
courts
that
we
have
the
courts
can't
resolve
a
controversy
in
advance
of...
can't
resolve
a
dispute
like
that
in
advance
of
a--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--of
a
concrete
case
of
controversy.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
and
that's
not
the
case
here.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
there
are...
well,
if
the
state
really...
if
the
state
implements...
if
the
state
finds
it
necessary
to
go
so
far--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--okay.
right.
well,
i...
i
mean,
in
allen,
though,
there
was
a
ripe
controversy.
i
mean,
i
think
that's
an
important
difference,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
again,
i
think
that
in
terms
of
the
district
court's
jurisdiction
there
are
a
number
of
factors
that
one
has
to
take
into
account.
first,
it
is
a
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
problem.
the
court
has
to
find
an
express
waiver
of
sovereign
immunity
for
a
suit
against
the
united
states,
and
that...
in
allen
the
court
didn't
look
at
it
that
way.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
this
is
not...
i
think
morris
v.
gressette
really
resolves
that
this
is
not
an
administrative
procedure
act
type
claim,
and
it
has
to
fall
within--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
our
view
is
that
the...
that
this
case
has
to
be
resolved
only
within
the
confines...
the
jurisdiction
is
only
within
the
confines
of
section
5
itself,
and
that
it's
really
an
exclusive...
exclusive
mechanism.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
in
allen...
in
allen--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that's
right,
but
again
that
was...
i
mean,
at
that
time
i
think
the
court
did
not
view
actions
against
the
states
as
raising
the
same
sovereign
immunity
concerns
that...
as
it
might
now
or
as
it
does
against
suits
against
the
united
states.
the
only
basis
for
jurisdiction
for
this
type
of
claim
is
section
5
itself,
and
that,
for
the
reasons
we
give
in
our
brief,
that's
not...
we
don't
find
it
to
fall
within
section
5.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
if
they
were...
i
think
if
they
sought
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
once
they're
implementing--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
if
they
were
doing
that
before
the
statute
had
ever
been
implemented,
or
before
there
was
ever
any...
in
a
situation
where
there
was
no
expectation
it
would
be
implemented
in
the
future,
there
would
be
a
serious
prudential
ripeness
concern
there.
i
think
it
would
be
the
same--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
i
think
that
if--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
i
think
that
probably
would
be
within
statutory
jurisdiction,
just
as--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think...
well,
i
think
that
what
it
reflects
is
that
they
didn't
preclear
it...
they
didn't
ask
for
preclearance
because...
and
i
can't
speak
for
the
state,
obviously,
why
they
didn't
request
preclearance,
but
that
they
knew
that
they
weren't
going
to...
they
knew
that
it
wasn't
going
to
be
done
immediately,
and
so
there
was
nothing
to
pre...
there
was
no
implementation
of
it
to
preclear.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
right,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right,
but
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that
may
be,
but
i
don't
think...
i
mean,
but
the
section
is
designed
principally
for
preclearance,
for
preclearance
actions,
and
i
don't
think...
this
is
really
somewhat
hypothetical,
but
if
the
state
did
bring
such
an
action
and
got
preclearance,
i
don't
think
the
state
could
complain
about
that.
i
mean,
they
couldn't
appeal
a
judgment
preclearing--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--preclearing
legislation,
and
indeed--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
but--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
wouldn't
be
the
worst
part
of
it,
because
then
they
would
have
a
defense
to
any
action
brought
by
a
private
party
in
a
local
three...
in
a
local
district
court,
but
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think
they
can.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
don't
think
they
can.
i
do
want
to
turn--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it's...
i
think
that
section
5
is...
well...
i
mean...
well,
i
think
that
section
5
is
really
exclusive,
and
that
they
can't
just
proceed
to
a...
i
mean,
i
don't
think
they
could
proceed
to
a
single
district
judge
in
a...
in
district
court
under
the
declaratory
judgment
act,
because
i
think
that
section...
really
the
only
way
the
issues--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--of
coverage
can
be
raised
are
those--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
think
that
our
view
is
that
section
5
really
is
exclusive.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
it's
the
only...
it
sets
forth
the
ways
in
which
one
can--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
no,
no--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
mean,
it
can
be
raised--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
can
be
raised
if
they
bring
preclearance...
i
mean,
a
similar
case
is
probably
city
of
lockhart,
where
i
believe
the
city
argued...
they
both
argued
for
preclearance,
and
they
also
said,
it's
not
a
change.
in
other
words,
it...
they
argued
it
wasn't...
it's
a
little
bit
different
than
this
because
they
weren't
arguing
it
didn't
affect
voting,
but
they
argued
it
wasn't
a
change
from
the
previous...
from
the
cases
before.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
it
was
a
preclearance
action
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia,
and
this
court,
although
this
court
found
it
was
a
change,
it
did...
it
did
examine
it,
the
lower
court
did,
and
this
court
did
examine
it
on
direct
appeal.
i
think
the...
it
is...
this
is
a
very
unusual
statutory
provision,
there's
no
doubt
about
it,
but
congress
wanted
these
questions
to
be
brought,
i
think
within
the
section
5
confine.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
three
judge
court
can,
yes,
and
the
similar
cases,
the
other
texas
case
that
was--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--no,
but
in
both
of
those
cases
there
was
an
actual
preclearance
action
brought.
it
was
a
classic
preclearance
action
brought
in
the
three
judge
court
where
the
state
was
actually...
or
the
city
in
lockhart,
the
state
in
texas,
was
actually
to
implementing
something,
and
they
argued
in
the
alternative,
if
you
will,
that--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
don't
think
that
that...
that
there
is
jurisdiction
for
just
that.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
first
of
all
that's
definitely
not...
i
mean,
that's
definitely
not
what
was
done
in
this
case,
and
so--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--and
so
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
three
judge
court
had
jurisdiction,
and
that
would
bring
it
to
this
court
under
the
mandatory
direct
appeal
procedure,
but
whether
or
not
it
could
have
been
brought
in
a
three
judge--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--that's
correct.
i
mean,
we--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--we
did...
we
did...
but
the
district
court
did
itself
raise
doubts
as
to
whether
it
properly
had
statutory
jurisdiction,
and
this
court
has,
on
other
occasions,
itself
examined
whether
there
was
a
statutory
basis
for
jurisdiction.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
guess
our
position
is,
the
state
can
get
that
resolved
when
it
is...
when
it
is...
it
can
actually
implement
the
change
and
require
somebody
to
come
in,
in
effect,
and
challenge
that.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
i
do
want
to...
i
just
want
to
say
that,
i
mean,
it's
not
the
case
that
the
state
has
no
forum
in
which
its
argument
can
be
tested.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think
that
is
an
option
that's--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--we
might...
yes.
we
might--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
believe
under...
yes,
they
are,
if
a
private--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i'm
not
sure.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
they
can
also...
they
can
also
ask
for
preclearance,
and
we
did
preclear
both
in
the
city
of
new
york
case--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--and
city
of
new
york...
and
once
we
asked
the
questions...
well,
once
we
asked
questions,
then
we
expeditiously
precleared
it.
they
can
also
go
to
the
three
judge
court
in
the
district
of
columbia
and
say,
we
need
to
do
this...
we
need
to
do
this
right
away,
please
resolve
this
issue
promptly,
and
also
please
resolve
it
on
the
question
of
whether
it's
coverage,
and
that
is
open
to
the
district
court,
although
as
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
mean,
i
do
think
that
the
attorney
general's
review
is
viewed
as
more
expeditious,
and...
but
i
don't
think
that...
i
mean,
i
don't
think--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
the
city
of
new
york
case
was
done
in
22
days.
i
do
want
to
point
that
out.
i
mean,
it's...
we
do
have
a
responsibility
to
be
cautious
in
this
area
as
to
what
is
or
is
not
a
change
affecting
voting.
i
mean,
our
position
is
that
(7)
and
(8)
on
their
face
do
admit
of
the
possibility
that
there
is
a
change
affecting
voting,
and
it's
possible
to
see
situations
where
it
could
be
implemented
in
a
discriminatory
way,
and--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
do.
i
think
that
the
appeal
provision
of
section
5,
which
provides
for
a
direct
appeal
to
this
court
in
any
appeal,
is
quite
different
than,
for
example,
the
provisions
in
the
old...
under
the
old
three
judge
district
court,
the
old
three
judge
district
court
statute
where
law
of
a
state
was...
the
constitutionality
was
drawn
into
question.
i
think
that
the
perp
that...
under
that
old
provision,
the
court
had
to
engage
in
this
very
elaborate
analysis
about
whether...
was
the
three
judge
court
properly
convened,
because
did
they...
or
did
there
have
to
be
a
three
judge
court,
and
then
if
the...
the
end
result
under
that
analysis
was
basically,
if
the
three
judge
district
court
ruled
on
any
ground
other
than
striking
down
the
state
statute
or
upholding
it
on
the
merits,
then
the
case
had
to
go
back
to
the
three
judge
district
court,
really,
and
then
taken
back
up
the
court
of
appeals.
i
don't
think
section
5
provides
for
such
an
elaborate
provision.
i
do
think
that
the
expedition
of
section
5
is
a
factor
that
indicates
that
the
court
can
resolve
the
cases
that
were
brought
up
to
it
directly.
naacp
v.
city
of
new
york
is
the
leading
case
on
this
point,
where
in
that
case
there
was
a
motion
to
intervene,
i
think
in
the...
i
think
it
was
in
a
preclearance
action
in
the
district
of
columbia
district
court,
and
the
motion
to
intervene
was
denied.
that
case
was
brought
directly
up
to
this
court,
and
this
court
said,
we
can
decide
that,
and
i
think
this
case
is
similar.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i'm
not
aware
that
the
attorney
general's
guidelines
have
anything
directly
on
that
point.
i
mean,
we
can
preclear
parts
of
things,
of
course,
and
so
if,
for
example,
you
know,
there
were
a...
if
the
state
were
planning
to
do
two
or
three
different
things,
say,
in
several
school
districts,
and
there
was
an
emergency
in
one,
and...
we
could
preclear...
we
could
do
partial
preclearance,
or
we
can
say,
we
think
that
this
provision
is
precleared,
but
we
need
to
look
a
little
more
closely
at
another
provision
under
which
you
are
exercising
authority,
so
there
is
that
possibility.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
well,
i
mean,
i
think
that
if
there
is...
if
they're
actually
implementing
it,
then
that
is
by
far
the
preferred
procedure,
to
go
into
the
three
judge
district
court.
that's
the
preferred
procedure
that
congress
set
up,
and...
but
i
don't
think
it's
correct
to
say
that
the
state
has
no
options.
i
mean,
obviously
we
prefer
that
a
preclearance
action
be
brought
in
the
three
judge
district
court,
or
that
a
submission
be
made
to
the
attorney
general,
but
just
as
the
three...
but
in
all
these
situations,
we
can't
resolve
all
of
these
questions
in
advance,
before
some
actual
implementation
is
proposed.
i
mean,
the...
certainly,
for
the
reasons
i've
explained
the
three
judge
district
court
can't
do
that
because
of
article
iii
concerns,
and
the
attorney
general
also...
although
the
attorney
general
may
be
able
to
preclear,
and
often
does
preclear
enabling
legislation,
the
attorney
general
often
has
to
wait
until
some
actual
implementation
of
that
is
proposed
before
review...
both
before
reviewing
that
on
the
merits
and
also
even
making
a
considered
determination
as
to
whether
it
would
be
a
change
affecting
voting.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
finally.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
yes.
i
mean,
i
think
in
effect
the
state
has
asked
for
an
advisory
opinion
that
if
the
commissioner
of
education
at
some
point
decides
to
appoint
a
master
or
a
management
team
for
a
local
school
district,
then
that
appointment
would
not
be
a
change
affecting
voting,
and
i
think
it
is
significant
that,
as
the
state
has
acknowledged,
that
it's
their
policy
that
when
a
school
district
does
have
performance
problems
the
commissioner
tries
to
resolve
those
problems
through
less
intrusive
sanctions,
and
we
don't
know
that
in
the...
now
or
in
the
imminent
future
the
commissioner
will
ever
need
to
go
so
far
as
to
reach
the
sanctions
under
sections
7
and
8.
i
mean,
section--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--we
know
it
happened--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
renne
v.
geary
is
actually
fairly
clear
that
that
does
not...
fact
does
not
change
either
the
analysis
or
the
result,
that
that...
that
controversy
was
moot
before
this
complaint
was
filed.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
i
think...
well,
one
thing
is
that
under
the
texas
law
when
the
commissioner
of
education
appoints
a
master
or
a
management
team
he
is
supposed
to
delineate
the
powers
of
the
master
or
the
management
team.
now,
i
agree
we
don't
necessarily
know
every
single
thing
that
that
master
or
management
team
might
do,
but
i
think
we
will
have
a
much
better
idea
when
that
happens
of
what
are
the
totality
of
the
powers
of...
that
might
be
exercised.
now--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right,
but
i
think
the...
i
mean,
that
point
we
may
have,
we
and
the
district
court
may
have
questions.
i
mean,
the
face
of
the
statute,
i
think,
lends
itself
to
some
rather
evident
questions.
for
example,
the
statute
says,
well,
the
master
or
the
management
team
may
not
adopt
a
budget
that
is
different
from
the
one
adopted--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--by
the
school
board,
but
it
also
says
that
the
master
or
the
management
team
may
direct
the
trustees
to
take
any
action.
well,
may
the
master
or
the
management
team,
although
he
can't...
he,
they,
or
she
can't
adopt
a
budget
himself.
can
they
tell
the
district
court,
tell
the
school
district
we
don't
like
your
budget,
do
a
new
one,
and
what
happens...
you
know,
is
that
anticipated?
i
mean,
there
are--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i...
right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
right.
i--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
i
think
that
it's
possible
that
a
commission...
the
commissioner
might
give
the
master
the
full
authority
on
the
face
of
the
statute,
and
under
that
situation
you
might
have
a
situation
in
which
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
but
still,
you
might
have...
still...
i
mean,
the...
well,
under
9,
for
example,
the
board
of
managers
can
just
say,
i'm
going
to
do
a
new
budget,
you
know.
i
don't
care
what
the
school
district's
old
budget
said.
now...
but
i
think
under
8,
or
under
7
or
8
he
has...
he
may
have
in
effect
the
same
power,
although
it
has
to
be...
or
almost
the
same
power,
although
it's
exercised
in
a
different
way.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
the
state--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--right.
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
the
state...
the
school
district--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--the
school
district
has
a
budget,
and
the
master
or
the
management
team
takes
a
look
at
it
and
says,
you
know,
i
don't
like
this
budget.
i
think
that
you
have
to
completely
rewrite
it.
you
have
to
make
it
20
percent
less,
reallocate,
you
know,
less
on
building
schools
and
more
on
teacher
training
and
school
books,
and
if
you
don't...
and
so
you
just
take
this
back
and
write
a
new
budget.
i
think
that
is
probably...
that
we
would
think
that
is
a
de
facto
replacement
along
with
all
the
others
powers,
because
even
though
the
school
district--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
could.
i
mean,
i
do
want
to
say
just
because
it's
a--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--well,
i
do
want
to
say
just
because
it's
a
de
facto
replacement
doesn't
mean
it
does.
i
mean,
it
may--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--it
may
be
perfectly
okay.
but
i
do
think
there
are
situations...
for
example,
suppose
that
because
of
demographic
changes
a
school
district
for
the
first
time
becomes
majority
hispanic,
or
majority
black,
or
substantial
minority
such
that
the
hispanics
and
blacks
can
for
the
first
time
influence
who
the...
influence
the
election
of
the...
of
their
elected
officials,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
the
commissioner
decides
to
implement...
decides
we
don't
like
that,
you
know...
i'm
not...
you
know,
we
want
to
have
an
appointee
who's
responsible
to
the
commissioner.
now,
i'm
not
saying
that
has
happened
or
will
happen,
but
there
are--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--of
school--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
it--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
the--
mr.
paul
r.
q.
wolfson
--i
think
that
the
budget
reflects...
you
know,
among
other
things
reflects
the
entire
policy
that
the
school
board,
the
elected
school
board
wants.
that's
what
people
elect...
when
people
elect
a
school
board
they
elect
them
in
order
to
make
various
policy
judgments,
some
of
which
are
reflected
in
a
budget,
and
the
master
may
disagree.
thank
you
very
much.
