mr.
javier
aguilar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
the
temporary
appointment
of
a
master
or
a
management
team
with
limited
powers
to
assist
school
districts
that
are
not
achieving
the
academic
goals
set
by
the
state
is
not
a
change
with
respect
to
voting
but,
rather,
it
is
a
temporary
change
with
respect
to
governance.
more
precisely,
such
an
appointment
does
not
result
in
the
de
facto
replacement
of
the
elected
school
board.
a
review
of
the
statute,
which
you
can
find
at
pages
90a
through
92a
of
the
jurisdictional
statement
appendix
shows
that
the
board
members...
excuse
me,
shows
that
the
master
and
the
management
team
have
very
limited
powers.
they
cannot
take
any
action
concerning
any
type
of
district
elections.
they
cannot
take
any
action
with
regard
to
the
number
of
board
members
to
be
elected,
or
the
method
of
selecting
the
board
member.
that
is,
they
can't
change
from
single
member
districts
to
at
large
districts
to
cumulative
voting,
which
is
available
to
them
under
the
education
code.
they
may
not
set
a
tax
rate
for
the
district.
they
cannot
adopt
a
budget
that's
different
than
the
one
that
the
school
board
members
themselves
have
voted
for
and
adopted.
mr.
javier
aguilar
we...
i--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that's--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--we're
here
because
in
fact,
when
this
legislation
was
passed,
we
submitted
all
of
the
amendments
to
the
education
code,
both
those
that
affected
voting
and
those
that
didn't.
we
just
presented
it
with
all
of
them.
we
did
not
identify
these
provisions
as
being
election
related.
the
department
of
justice,
the
attorney
general
informed
us
that
they
believed
that
they
were,
and
requested
us
to
submit
further
information.
mr.
javier
aguilar
that
they--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
that
they
believed
that--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--might
be.
mr.
javier
aguilar
more
appropriately
stated.
so
we
answered
their
questions,
thinking
that
once
we
provided
them
with
answers
to
their
questions,
that
they
would
agree
with
us
that
in
fact
they
were
not
election
related.
well,
that
is
not
what
happened,
justice
scalia.
they
in
essence
precleared
the
provisions,
and
i'm
talking
about
as--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--their
unwillingness...
well,
i
guess
what
they're
saying
is
that
they
believe,
since
they
precleared
them
as
enabling
legislation,
that
they...
once
we
actually
put
them
into
effect
in
those
situations
when
we
need
them,
to
utilize
them,
that
they
will
result
in--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--but
we
didn't
ask
them
to...
we
went
ahead
and
provided
them
with
the
information
they
requested.
we
did
it,
if
you
will,
under
protest.
we
informed
them
that
we
did
not
think
these
were
election
related.
we
tried
to
make
the
argument,
and
we
did
make
the
argument
as
to
why
we
thought
it
wasn't.
i
think
the
statute
contains--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
we're
here,
your
honor,
because
we
believe
that
the
statute
as
written,
and
as
limited
by
provision
(e)
on
page
91a,
in
essence
passes
that
bright
line
test
that
this
court
established
in
presley.
mr.
javier
aguilar
there
is
no
way...
there's
no...
i'm
sorry,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
javier
aguilar
that
is
true.
mr.
javier
aguilar
that's
not
correct,
justice
kennedy.
the
commissioner,
under
subdivision
(9)--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--the
commissioner,
under
subdivision
(9),
is
the
one
that
can
appoint
a
board
of
managers,
and
we
did
not
challenge
provisions
(9)
and
(10).
we
are
not
here
today
suggesting
that
that
is...
that
does
not
fall
within
section
(5).
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
attorney
general's
assessment
with
regard
to
(9)
and
(10).
mr.
javier
aguilar
under
(9)
and
(10)
we
would
submit
them.
under
(9),
i
think
that's
where
you
have
a
de
facto
replacement,
because
in
fact
the
commissioner
has
the
authority
to
select
members
of
the
school...
i
mean,
citizens
of
the
school
district,
residents
of
the
school
district
and
appoint
them
as
board
of
managers
to
replace
the
elected
board,
and
they'll
have
all
the
power
of
the
board.
i
think
that
is
more
in
keeping
with
what
this
court
had
in
mind
in
presley
with
regard
to
the
reference
to
a
de
facto
replacement,
but
under
no
circumstance
can
that
happen
under
numbers
(7)
and
(8),
because
the
legislature
has
gone
out
of
its
way
to
define
away
the
problem,
if
you
will,
to
make
sure
that
it
took
it
out
of
the
coverage
of
section
(5)
by
allowing
them
to
have
authority--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
javier
aguilar
there
is--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--they
can
direct
any
action
to
be
taken...
the
reason...
let
me
back
up
and
start
at
the
beginning,
justice
stevens.
the
reason
a
master
or
a
management
team
are
needed
is
because
there
are
severe
problems
with
the
school
district.
for
instance,
a...
they
have
schools,
any
number
of
schools
that
are--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that's
correct,
but
we're
not
arguing
(9)
and
(10).
mr.
javier
aguilar
because...
(10)
is
easy,
i
think.
that's
an
annexation.
we
don't
have
any
quarrel
with
the
fact
that
that
falls
within
section
(5).
(9)
i
think
falls
within
the
caveat
in
presley
about
de
facto
replacement.
i
think
that
probably
satisfies
what
this
court
had
in
mind.
but
(7)
and
(8),
that
is
not
a
de
facto
replacement,
and
that's
the
only
thing
we're
talking
about
possibly
being
a
reason
for
it
falling
within
section
(5),
because
the
legislature
has
said
in
the
limitations
found
in
subdivision
(e)
that
there
are
certain
things
that
the
master
or
management
team
cannot
touch,
for
instance,
setting
of
the
tax
rate,
or
the
amount
of
money
that
the
citizens
in
that--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
they
can
tell
the
board
of
trustees
what
to
do
with
regard
to
solving
the
problem
in
issue.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
that
is--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--because
of
the
limitations
they
cannot...
if
we
conceive
of
the
authority
of
the
elected
board
members
as
being
a
pie,
we're
not
taking
the
entire
pie
away
from
them
the
way
we
are
in
(a)(9).
we
may
be
taking
a
portion
away,
but
we're
never
going
to
take
all
of
it
away.
they
still
make
decisions
with
regard
to
how
much
total
money
is
spent,
how
much
money
is
raised,
and
anything
having
to
do
with
elections,
whether
it
be
bond
elections,
or
the--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
that
is...
you're
right
with
regard
to
the
allocation
of
the
total
amount
of
the
budget.
you're
right,
your
honor.
the
master
or
the
management
team,
in
order
to
solve
the
prob...
it
may
be
that
the
problem
is
that
they're
not
spending
money
appropriately
in
certain
programs
in
order
to
get
the
school
kids
to
pass
their
reading
and
their
math
exams
that
they
have
to
take
every
year
from
grades
3
to
8,
and
so
they'll
direct
it...
maybe
they
ought
to
emphasize
that
aspect,
and
spend
money
on
those
programs,
and
perhaps
teachers
in
those
programs.
but
they
are...
they
still
don't
have
the
entire
pie,
if
you
will.
they
still
don't
have
all
the
authority
of
the
board,
because
they
can't
touch
elections.
they
cannot
set
the
ultimate
level
of
expenditures.
for
instance,
if
the
school
board
says
that
the
budget
for
next
year
will
be
$50
million,
the
board...
the...
excuse
me,
the
master
or
the
management
team
can't
go
in
there
and
require
them
to
increase
the
budget
or
decrease
the
budget.
that
is
something
that
state
law
has
given,
and
this
provision
reserves
to--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--yes,
your
honor.
they
have
to
in
order
to
be
able
to
solve
the...
if,
in
fact,
the
problem
is
the
result
of
misguided,
if
you
will,
management
in
terms
of
not
spending
the
money
appropriately,
they're
spending
too
much
money
in
athletics
and
not
as
much
money
on
reading
and
writing
and
arithmetic,
well,
then
they
have
the
authority
to
say
you've
got
to
direct
more
money
to
these
essential
items
in
order
for
you
all
to
meet
the
state
standards
with
regard
to
passage
rates
on
the
achievement
tests.
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
javier
aguilar
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
javier
aguilar
no,
they
cannot.
no,
they
cannot,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
because
that
would
be...
if
they're
under
a
court
order
to
bus--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--they
cannot
in
any
way...
they
cannot
in
any
way
interfere
with
that.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
i--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--i
guess--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--right.
i
don't
think...
it's
possible
that
that
could
happen
if,
in
fact,
there's
some
reason
to
do
that.
in
other
words,
in
order
to
solve
the
problem
that
have
them
there
to
begin
with,
but
ordinarily,
no,
they
wouldn't
do
that.
mr.
javier
aguilar
no,
they
have
not,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
well,
i
think
that
what
they
can
do
is
limited
by
the
problem
at
hand
and
how
they
go
about
solving
it,
the
creativity
of
trying
to
solve
that
problem,
but
that's
not
where
we...
that's
not
the
argument
we're
relying
on.
the
argument
we're
relying
on--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that
is
excluded
under
(e)(6),
may
not
adopt
a
budget
for
the
district...
that's
on
page
92a--that
provides
for
spending
a
different
amount,
exclusive
of
required
debt
service,
from
that
previously
adopted
by
the
board
of
trustees.
what
i
was
trying
to
say
was
that
we
believe
that
the
statute,
when
reviewed,
clearly
shows
that
we're
not
dealing
with
section
5
coverage
regarding
changes
in
the
manner
of
voting,
the
candidacy
requirements,
the
composition
of
the
electorate,
the
creation
or
abolition
of
an
elected
office
and,
indeed,
the
attorney
general's
sole
basis
for
the
preclearance
as
enabling
legislation
was
the
issue
of
de
facto
replacement.
it's
our
position
that
this
statute
clearly
shows
that
we
can
never
even
get
to
that
point,
that
in
fact--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--no,
your
honor,
and
i
think
there's
a
good
reason
for
that.
prior
to
1992,
before
this
court
established
its
bright
line
test
between
what
is
a
change
with
respect
to
voting
and
what
is
a
change
with
respect
to
governance,
i
don't
think
there
really
was
a
good...
a
good
understanding...
anything
that
affected
voting
in
any
way,
i
believe,
is
the
way
i
would
characterize
the
pre-'92
law,
would
be
covered
by
section
5.
i
think
the
bright
line
test
laid
down
by
this
court
in
presley
in
'92
gave
us
the
opportunity
and
gave
the
legislature
the
opportunity
to
say,
well,
how
can
we
effect
these
provisions
to
make
sure
that
they're
utilized
quickly
when
necessary
without
having
to
go
through
the
preclearance
route,
because
it's
really
not
their
intention
to
have
any
effect
on
elections,
and--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--(9)
and
(10)
are
the
last
steps,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
javier
aguilar
that
is
correct.
mr.
javier
aguilar
there's
six
of
them
listed
on
page
90a,
a
public
notice
of
the
deficiency--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--is
the
first
one.
the
second
one
is
having
a
hearing--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--conducted
by
the
board.
i
mean,
there
are
a
lot
of
other
interventions,
if
you
will,
not
as
draconian
as
(9)
and
(10).
mr.
javier
aguilar
we
would
hope
that
the
school
boards,
and
we
believe
that
the
vast
majority,
the
overwhelming
majority
of
elected
school
board
members
of
all
1,056
school
boards
in
texas
are
dedicated
to
making
sure
that
their
school
districts--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--meet
the
standards
that
the
state
has--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--we
have
in
one
case.
mr.
javier
aguilar
the...
we
made
mention
of
the
fact
of
the
wilmer
hutchins
independent
school
district,
where
we--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
if
i
may
go
outside
the
record,
i
certainly
can
answer
that
question.
basically
the
master...
the
management
team
went
in
to
try
to,
on
the
one
hand
increase
the
pass
rate
and
drop
out
rate
of
certain
schools
in
that
district,
and
on
the
other
hand
make
sure
that--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--correct.
mr.
javier
aguilar
no,
justice
kennedy,
that's
not
the
way
it
works.
he
was...
the
commissioner
was
authorized
to
appoint
the
master
under
(a)(7),
and
then
under
(a)(7)
the
powers
that
he
can
appoint
are
circumscribed
or
limited
under
(e).
in
other
words,
they
have
the
authority
to
go
in
and
fix
the
problem,
but--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--that
is
my
recollection,
yes.
there's
no
other
way
that
you
can
appoint
a
master,
your
honor,
under
our
scheme.
it
certainly
wasn't
an
(a)(9).
it
was
not
a
board
of
managers,
and
so
it's
(a)(7)
that
deals
with
an
appointment
of
a
master.
mr.
javier
aguilar
yes,
justice--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--let
me
explain.
we
got
into
the
court
because
we
were
precleared,
if
you
will,
against
our
will,
because
we
didn't
think
these
measures,
(7)
and
(8),
were
affecting
voting.
the
attorney
general
basically
told
us
that
you've
got
to
preclear
any
utilization
of
(7)
or
(8)
before
we
can
say
anything
about
it,
therefore
putting
us
in
the
process,
the
section
5
process.
we
think
that
that...
that
that
legal
determination
can
be
reviewed
by
a
three
judge
panel.
mr.
javier
aguilar
your
honor--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
no.
as
i
answered
justice
o'connor,
we
have
no...
this
has
never
been
done
before
as
far
as
we
know,
and
what
i
mean
by
that
is,
we
don't
know
of
an
instance
where
a
state
has
gotten
a
ruling
from
the
attorney
general
that
a
provision
falls
within
section
5
when
the
state
believes,
after
applying
supreme
court
precedent,
that
it
is
not
part
of
section
5.
that's
why
we've--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--we're
invoking
the
court's--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--the--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--the...
what
we
did
with
the
court
below
was,
we
said
that
this
is
a
section
5
issue
with
regard
to
the
coverage
question.
we
believe
that
every
preclearance
action
certainly
comes
with
the
predicate
question
of
whether
this
is
a
change
affecting
voting.
i
think
that
if--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--i
beg
your--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
i
think
we're
relying
on
this
court's
decision
in
allen.
this
court
was
able
to
get
around
the
statute's
language
and
allow
for
private
plaintiffs
to
file
an
action
on
the
coverage
question
and
then
enjoin
a
covered
jurisdiction
from
proceeding
with
the
enactment.
we're
suggesting
that
the
language
in
the
rationale
of
allen
gives
us
the
right
to
come
before
the
three
judge
panel
in
the
district
court
of
the
district
of
columbia
in
order
to
review
an
erroneous...
what
we
believe,
in...
with
all
due
respect
is
an
erroneous
legal
determination
with
regard
to
the
coverage
question
by
the
attorney
general.
i
think--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--absolutely,
your
honor.
we
were
involved
in
that
kind
of
claim
previously.
there's
no
question
about
that.
what
we're
trying...
if
we
can...
the
logic
is,
if
we
are
entitled
to
bring
an
action
in
the
district
court
that
raises
both
the
predicate
question
and
the
question
of
purpose
and
effect,
then
we
believe
that
we
also
have,
under
the
logic
of
allen,
the
right
to
bring
the
coverage
question
only
when
we
are
in
a
situation
where
we
have,
for
lack
of
a
better
term,
been
induced
to
get
preclearance
by
the
attorney
general
on
an
issue
that
we
don't
believe
falls
within...
on
an
enactment
we
don't
believe
falls
within
section
5
to
begin
with,
based
on
our
reading
of
presley.
we
believe
that
this
court
attempted
to
draw
a
distinction
in
presley
between
those
enactments
that
respect
voting
and
those
that
do
not,
and
we
are
attempting
to
bring
to
this
court,
and
initially
to
the
court
below,
a
declaratory
judgment
seeking
a
declaration
that
in
fact
the
legal
judgment
of
the
attorney
general
with
regard
to
the
application
of
presley
is
incorrect,
and
the
only--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
let
me
explain
it
this
way,
your
honor.
once
we
were
precleared
as
enabling,
then...
if
we
were
to
ignore...
if
we
were
to
ignore
their
determination
and
just
say,
well,
we
think
they're
wrong,
we're
just
going
to
go
ahead
and
enact,
and
just
utilize
this
whenever
we
want
to
because
there's
no
way
it
falls
within
section
5,
in
all
likelihood
we
will
either
get
sued
by
private
plaintiffs,
or
we'll
get
an
enforcement
action
from
the
attorney
general.
if
we
get
sued
by
private
plaintiffs,
in
all
likelihood
we
will
lose
on
our--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--oh,
i
see.
instead
of
opting--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
if
you're
saying
that
back
at
the
time
when
we
presented
the
entire
education
code
and
then
identified
those
areas
that
were
election
related
for
preclearance
that
we
should
have
taken
this
issue
and
gone
to
the
district
of
columbia...
is
that--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--actually--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
the
reason
we
didn't
do
that,
your
honor,
was
because
we
wanted
to
act
quickly.
we
did
not
want
to
have
to
wait
for
a
year
or
two
to
get
a
judicial
resolution
of
whether
this
was
a
change
affecting
voting,
or
whatever,
and--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--with
regard
to
preclearance
of
the--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--wilmer
hutchins?
it
took
90
days,
and
during
that
90-day
period
of
time...
again,
i'm
going
out...
well,
actually,
we
mention
this
in
our
briefing
before
this
court
and
the
court
below.
during
that
period
of
time
irs
and
fbi
agents
were
going
in
raiding
the
district
offices
because
they
suspected
some
financial
goings
on.
we
could
not
do
anything
as
a
state
to
reach
in
there
and
fix
the
problem
so
that
the
schoolchildren
would
have--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
let
me--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
federalism
is
ultimately
our
greatest
concern,
justice
scalia.
we
believe
that
if
these
enactments...
if
we're
correct,
and
they're
truly
not--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
we're
also
concerned
about...
well,
our
concern
is
with
federalism.
if
we
don't
fall
within
the
purview
of
section
5,
then
we
should
not
have
to
incur
the
burdens
of
section
5.
we
believe
that
this
is
a
process
where--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--well,
your
honor,
if
we
were
to
do
that...
that's
what
i
was
trying
to
explain
earlier.
if
we
were
to
do
that
and
just
ignore
what
has
happened
with
us
before
the
attorney
general,
then
in
all
likelihood
we
would
get,
i
think,
private
litigation,
or
private
plaintiffs
filing
a
lawsuit
saying,
wait
a
minute,
you
can't
bring
the
master
or
management
team
in
because
this
is
a
change
affecting
voting,
and
you
haven't
precleared.
and
i
think
the
first
thing
that
will
happen
is,
in
all
likelihood
we'll
lose
a
preliminary
injunction
because,
of
course,
the
attorney
general's
judgments
are
accorded
deference
by
the
courts,
and
it
will
again
delay
the
process
that
we're
trying
to
institute,
and
that
is
quickly
move
in
and
try
to--
mr.
javier
aguilar
--it
took
them
90
days,
your
honor.
we...
i
personally
phoned
and
asked
for
them
to
expedite
it,
and
in
fact
we
got,
on
the
sixtieth
day,
more
questions
asked
and
30
days
later
we
got
a
result.
the
fundamental...
our
fundamental
position
is
that
when
you
apply
presley
to
this
statute,
to
the
words
of
this
statute,
we...
we're
of
the
opinion
that
it
does
not
fall
within
section
5,
because
it's
certainly
not
election
related,
and
it's
certainly
not
the
abolition
or
creation
of
a...
of
a
office.
and
finally,
the
only
other
thing
it
could
be
would
be
a
de
facto
replacement.
and
what
we're
arguing
is,
it
can
never
be
a
de
facto
replacement,
because
the
state,
in
the
provisions,
has
reserved
enough,
we
believe,
authority
to
the
school
board
members...
you
see,
the
school
board
continues
to
meet,
continues
to
debate,
continues
to
vote
on
important
items
like
tax
rates,
like
school
bond
elections,
like
the
amount
of
money
to
be
spent
on
the
school
for
the
following
years.
those
are
areas
that
our
master
or
management
team
don't
have
any
authority
for.
so
it
is
right,
from
the
perspective
of
we
have
a
statute
that
needs
to
be
interpreted.
we
have
a
wrong,
and
the
wrong
to
us
is
an
incorrect
determination
by
the
attorney
general
that
this
falls
within
section
5,
seen
through
the
prism
of
presley,
and
the
immediate
impact
on
us
is
that
it's
a
federalism
one
mixed
up
with
the
fact
that
there
is
delay
in
trying
to
get
state
processes
that
our
legislature,
elected
by
the
people,
wanted
to
put
in
place
in
order
to
strengthen
our
schools.
everybody's
concerned
with
stronger
schools.
mr.
javier
aguilar
i'm
not
suggesting
that
it
magically
alters
it,
your
honor.
i'm
just
saying
that
it
is
in
the
ripeness
analysis
you've
got
to
consider
the
federalism
concerns
when
there
has
been
an
incorrect
determination
that
an
enactment
falls
within
section
5
when
in
fact
it
doesn't.
this
court
itself
in
presley,
in
allen,
in
katzenbach,
all
of
those
cases,
been
consistent
in
saying
that
section
5
is
a
draconian
measure.
that
was
passed
for
good
reason.
we're
not
disputing
that,
but
what
we
are
saying
as
with
regard
to
these
two
provisions
they
do
not
fall
within
the
rubric,
within
the
coverage
of
section
5.
then
we
have
a
federalism
issue
here,
the
very
same
federalism
issue
that
this
court
has
consistently
noted
in
all
of
these
cases.
thank
you
very
much.
