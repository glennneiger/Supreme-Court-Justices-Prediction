--no,
but
they
can
defend
the
judgment
on
the
ground
that
it
wasn't
thought
of
below.
that's
wellsettled.
justice
john
paul
stevens
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
their
reading
of
the
statute
is
correct,
namely
that
the...
what
you
call
an
absolute
priority
statute
merely
applies
to
unsecured
claims,
then
we
don't
have
to
get
into
all
this,
and
we
would
have
to
affirm--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
that's
a
correct
reading
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
been
fully
briefed
in
this,
by
both
sides
in
this
case.
you
filed
a
reply
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
the
merits
of
the
attorney
general's
brief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
we
didn't
discuss
it
because
it
wasn't
raised
below,
and
that's
your
only
answer
to
that
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
go
into
history,
your
opponent
argues
you
go
back
to
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
and
apply
to
everything,
just
general
claims
and
not
secured
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
ignore
that
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
they
correctly
or
incorrectly
describe
the
law
in
england
before
we
got
started?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
they
go
beyond
what
your
reading
of
the
statute
was
in
the
first
part
of
your
brief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
was
thelusson
personal
property?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
normally
a
lien
attaches
to
the
proceeds,
or
i
mean...
well,
anyway,
go
ahead.
