why
not?
it
doesn't
make
any
sense.

mr.
mccartan,
if
i
understand
your
position
correctly
you're
not
asserting
that
just
the
entry
of
the
judgment
would
have
been
sufficient
to
overcome
the
government's
claim
here.
that
it
is
the
entry
of
the
judgment
plus
the
perfection
of
the
lien--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
recording
it
in...
as
against
particular
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
perfected
lien
under
the
uniform
commercial
code.
justice
antonin
scalia
are
these
all
very
old
cases,
mr.
mccartan,
because
that's
certainly
not
the
rule
now--
justice
antonin
scalia
--under
the
ucc.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
want
us
to
bring
the
lien
statute
up
to
date
with
the
ucc,
which
is
what
you
say
the
legislative
history
expresses
as
the
purpose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
you're
not
going
to
do
that
if
we
continue
to
make
this
absolute
requirement
that
in
the
case
of
personal
property
you
have
to
be
in
possession.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
mccartan's
point,
as
i
recall,
was
that
the
lien
in
that
case
was
not
perfected.
the
amount
was
not
even
established.
