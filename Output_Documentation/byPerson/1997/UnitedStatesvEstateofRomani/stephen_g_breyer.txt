justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
about
all
the
repair...
the
repairmen?
you
know,
people
come
in
and
they
fix
the
house,
and
normally
you
fix
the
house
or
you
fix
the
plumbing
and
throughout
the
law
there
are
all
kinds
of
ways
of
making
certain
those
people
get
paid.
they're
usually
called
mechanic's
liens,
and
here
congress
has
a
specific
statute
that
says,
you
know,
if
smith
dies
and
he...
or
if
smith
owes
money
on
taxes,
we
get
it
first.
we
use
this
magic
word
lien,
but
all
that
means
is,
we
get
it
first.
but
by
the
way,
we
don't
get
it
first
in
respect
to
the
mechanic.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
he
gets
his
money
first,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
saying
that
the
mechanic
lien...
the
mechanics
get
their
money
first,
before
the
tax
money,
i
take
it.
that's
not
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was
reading
632...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
i'm
taking...
a
lien
is
just
a
magic
way
of
saying
the
government
gets
paid
first,
i
think.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
then
my
question
actually
is...
thank
you,
that
is
much
clearer,
and
my
question
really
is
what
any
congressman
or
senator
would
have
had
in
mind
in
saying
that
my
goodness,
we
want
to
be
certain
those
mechanics
who
come
in
and
fix
the
roof
are
paid
before
the
irs,
and
that's
what
they
seem
to
say
in
1623
and,
in
fact,
if
we're
reading
of
the
statute
is
correct,
every
time
a
person
dies
insolvent
the
irs
gets
paid
before
the
mechanics.
now,
that
to
me
just
doesn't
make
any
sense.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
a
committee
did,
anyway.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'm
normally
with
you
on
legislative
history,
but
i'm
getting
off
the
train
in
this
instance
for
the
reason
that
i'd
ask
before
these
particular
bills,
of
what
sense
it
would
make?
what
sense
would
it
make--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--for...
to
have
a
law
which
says,
like
6323,
we
normally
put
all
these
things
ahead
of
the
secret
irs
lien,
because
it
isn't
necessary...
but
we
don't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
don't
put
it
ahead
when
the
person
dies.
i'm
looking
for
some
sense
in
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the...
so
i'm
still
back
to
the...
i'm
looking
at
it...
to
be
honest
with
you,
i'm
seeing
your
statute
as
a
very
old
one,
and
once
you
take
that
statute
the
courts
have
to
get
into
a
real
nightmare
of
an
issue
of
deciding
when
title
is
passed,
or
when
it
isn't
passed.
it
isn't
true
that
any
physical
property
in
the
possession
of
the
deceased
is
going
to
go
to
the
government.
you
have
to
draw
odd
lines.
time
passes.
congress
begins
to
pass
specific
statutes
dealing
with
specific
situations
that
set
up
priorities,
and
unless
there
is
some
reason
for
not
applying
these
later,
specific
statutes,
i
don't
know
why
we
wouldn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--because
they're
a
more
thoughtout,
careful
method
of
distinguishing
between
different
kinds
of--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what's
the...
what
is
special
about
dying
insolvent
as
opposed
to
just
living
and
not
paying
your
taxes?
what...
what's
the
difference.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
we--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--this
is
a
slightly
picky
point.
i'm
reminded
of
my
tax
professor,
ernie
brown,
and
i'm
looking
at
the
lien
statute,
and
you're
saying,
well,
that's
just
a
lien
statute.
we
win
anyway.
but
it
doesn't
say
the
united
states
shall
have
a
lien.
it
says
the
amount
owed
shall
be
a
lien,
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
6321.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
it
says,
if
i
die
insol...
i
know,
6323
refers
to
the
lien
in
6321.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
the
lien
won't
be
valid.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
what
6321
says
is,
the
amount
when
i
die
insolvent
and
owe
it
to
the
irs,
it
says
that
amount
shall
be
a
lien,
so
the
amount
that
i
owe
you
is
a
lien.
it's
not
that
you
have
a
lien.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
therefore
the
language
of
the
statute
is
consistent
with
it
replacing
the
statute
that
you're
talking
about.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we
have
to
say
it's
a
supplement?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where...
suppose
they're
right
on
the
lien
statute,
and
he's
clarified
the
argument
quite
well.
suppose
they're
right,
then
where...
suppose
they're
right,
in
other
words,
that
the
priority
statute
applies.
it
would
apply
to
people
who
die
insolvent.
if
that
were
true,
where
would
the
tax
lien
statute
apply?
it
couldn't
apply
to
dead
people,
because
the
other
one
does
for
dead
people.
it
would
apply
to
live
people.
it
couldn't
apply
to
live
bankrupt
people,
because
the
bankruptcy
statute
would
apply
to
those
people,
so
it
would
apply
to
insolvent
live
people
who
aren't...
no,
sorry,
it
would
apply
to
people
who...
perhaps
solvent
live
people.
now,
what
is
that
universe
like,
the
universe
of
solvent,
live
people
for
whom
one
needs
a
tax
lien
statute
for
the
government
to
collect
its
money?
what
is
that
universe?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
would
at
least
be
people
who
disappear,
but
even--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
might
be
somebody
who
disappeared,
leaving
a
house
behind,
and
you'd
have
a
tax
lien
against
the
property
you
could
find.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
any
other
area?
