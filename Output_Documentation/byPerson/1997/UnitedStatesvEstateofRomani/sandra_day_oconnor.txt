but
if...
the
whole
thing
is
so
strange.
what
if
the
insolvent
debtor,
instead
of
dying,
became
bankrupt?
then
the
government
isn't
necessarily
going
to
come
out
the
same
way.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
if
the
debtor
is
insolvent
and
dies,
then
you
say
this
3713
has
to
apply,
even
if
it's
a
tax
that
we're
talking
about.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
under
3713
instead
of
a
judgment
lien
there
had
been
a
prior
recorded
mortgage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what's
your
position?
suppose
there
was
a
prior
recorded
mortgage
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
we
were
talking
about
that
in
the
case
of
an
insolvent
who
dies--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--versus
the
government's
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
concede
that
in
the
mortgage
situation
the
mortgage
holder
would
come
out
ahead
of
the
government
here--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--if
it
were
a
recorded
mortgage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
are
you
saying?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
we'll
try
to
figure
out--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--what
we
were
saying.
i
want
to
know
what
you're
saying
about
this.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
know
that.
i'm
asking
what
your
position
is
if
it
were.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
not
like
a
mortgage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
priority
under
this
would
be
first
in
time,
first
in
right.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
mystery
what
the
priority
would
be
if--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--6323(a)
governs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
issue.
if
we
were
to
say
6323(a)
was
the
more
specific
and
it
applies,
then
it
would
be
first
in
time,
first
in
right,
wouldn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
counsel,
what's
your
best
case
for
support
of
your
position
that
the
judgment
lien
comes
before
the
government's
right
under
3713?
what's
your
best
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
the
judgment
lien
situation
different
somehow
from
a
mortgage
or
other
type
of
secured
interest
where
possession
changes,
or
title,
or--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--we...
the
court
below
didn't
really
get
into
the
question
of
the
nature
of
the
judgment
lien
here,
did
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
don't
actually
know
the
nature
of
it
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
we've
applied,
i
think,
a
higher
standard
in
justifying
any
displacement
of
section
3713.
we
really
have
at
least
articulated
a
higher
standard
than
just
finding
a
more
specific
statute.
