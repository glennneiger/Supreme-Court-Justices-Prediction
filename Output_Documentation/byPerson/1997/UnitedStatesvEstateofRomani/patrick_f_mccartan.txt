mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
start
with
the
question
posed
by
justice
stevens,
which
is
whether
antecedent
security
interests,
traditional
security
interests
survive
assertion
of
the
priority
of
the
united
states
government
under
the
priority
statute.
we
did
not
handle
this
case
below,
and
cannot
tell
the
court,
therefore,
why
it
was
not
discussed
below,
but
i
can
and
do
say
that
it
is
clearly
embraced
within
the
question
presented
by
the
government
in
its
petition.
that
is
why
they
argued
this
issue
at
pages
9
and
10
of
the
petition,
and
why
they
reargued
it
at
pages
14
and
16
of
their
opening
brief
on
the
merits
here.
the
statute
under
which
the
government
claims
priority
had
its
origins
in
the
prerogative
of
the
crown
for
the
payment
of
debts
due
to
the
sovereign.
when
it
was
enacted,
there
was
more
than
a
century
of
english
precedent
to
the
effect
that
antecedent
security
interests
would
survive
assertion
of
a
priority
under
the
prerogative
of
the
crown.
i
would
urge
this
court
to
revisit
your
early
decisions
and
those
of
some
of
the
lower
federal
courts
at
the
time.
it
is
old
learning,
but
it
demonstrates
quite
clearly
that
there
is
not
an
unbroken
line
of
authority
from
thelusson
v.
smith
to
modern
times,
as
contended
by
the
government.
thelusson
was
decided
in
1817.
11
years
later,
this
court
decided
conard
v.
atlantic
insurance
company,
stating,
and
it
was
essentially
the
same
court,
that
conard
should
be
limited...
or,
excuse
me,
that
thelusson
should
be
limited
to
the
circumstances
of
that
case,
and
stating
unequivocally
that
thelusson
did
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
perfected
lien
could
be
displaced
by,
and
i
quote,
the
mere
priority
of
the
government
under
revised
code
section
3466.
subsequently,
this
court,
in
united
states
v.
hack
and
brent
v.
bank
of
washington,
upheld
traditional
security
interests
against
assertion
of
priority
under
the
priority
statute.
for
a
period
of
75
years
thereafter,
it
was
the
understanding
of
the
lower
federal
courts
that
traditional
security
interests
would
survive
assertion
of
priority
by
the
government
under
this
statute.
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states
in
1857
issued
an
opinion
to
the
effect
that
thelusson
was
overruled
by
conard,
and
that
was
the
understanding,
that
was
the
assumption,
that
was
the
premise
on
which
the
lower
federal
courts
acted
from
that
point
on.
cottrell
v.
pierson,
which
appears
on
pages
11
and
12
on
our
brief,
i
think
is
illustrative
of
the
understanding
of
the
lower
federal
courts.
now,
it
wasn't
until
1933
in
new
york
v.
maclay
that
the
language
of
thelusson
referring
to
the
need
of
a
lienor
to
perfect
the
lien
by
acquiring
title
or
possession
was
revived.
maclay,
though,
was
a
case
which
involved
personal
property
and
an
unliquidated
amount
in
terms
of
the
lien.
the
new
york
state
statute
with
respect
to
franchise
taxes
is
very,
very
unusual.
franchise
taxes
under
the
new
york
law
are
a
lien
in
advance
of
the
years
in
which
they
are
due,
so
in
maclay
you
didn't
even
have
the
amount
of
the
lien
determined
because
it
wasn't
yet
due
and,
secondly,
any
property
to
which
it
may
have
attached
may
not
even
have
been
in
existence.
the
lien
is
obviously--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--you
mean
ahead,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
whether
the
lien
survives?
i
would
say
it
would
be
cottrell
v.
pierson,
united
states
v.
hack,
and
brent
v.
bank
of
washington.
those
three
cases
all
established
the
traditional
security
interests
would
survive
assertion
of
priority
by
the
government
under
the
statute.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
i
think
not,
your
honor,
and
this
court
itself
in
rankin
&
schatzell
v.
scott
said
that
a
judgment
lien
has
the
same
power
as
the
mortgage
to
hold
the
land,
and
if
we
look
at
these
early
cases--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--no,
it
did
not,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
we
know
that
it
was
a
judgment
lien
that
was
definite
with
respect
to
the
identity
of
the
judgment
creditor,
the
amount
of
the
judgment,
and
that
it
was
immediately
enforceable.
it
was
properly
perfected--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no,
your
honor.
it
applied
only--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--only
to
property
located
within
cambria
county,
which
is
the
county
where
the
judgment
was
entered,
indexed,
and
was
immediately
enforceable,
and
there
was
only
one
parcel
of
property
in
cambria
county
which
was
owned
by
the
debtor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
there
was
nothing
that
need
make
it
more
specific
than
that,
your
honor.
in
order
to
protect
the
interests
that
are
involved
here,
which
would
be
subsequent
purchasers,
or
anyone
else
with
an
interest
in
the
affairs
of
the
debtor,
a
simple
title
search
would
reveal
this.
it's
not
just
a
matter
of
journalizing
the
judgment
in
the
court
of
record.
it
is
taking
that
judgment
to
the
county
recorder
and
then
entering
it
there
and
indexing
it
so
that
it
will
appear
in
the
land--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--well,
your
honor,
when
they
say
that
the
mortgage
is
more
specific,
are
we
looking
at
the
nature
of
the
mortgage,
or
are
we
talking
just
about
parcels?
in
this
case,
there
was
only
one
piece
of
real
property
located
within
cambria
county
to
which
this
judgment
lien
could
attach.
the
judgment
lien
was
definite
with
respect
to
the
identity
of
the
judgment
creditor--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--the
amount
of
the
lien,
and
the
property.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no,
your
honor,
it
would
not
apply
to
any
property
located
in
other
counties
unless
that
judgment
were
taken
to
those
counties
and
indexed.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
in
every
county...
if
you
take
that
judgment
and
enter
it
according
to
state
law,
it
is
good
in
any
county
in
which
real
property
is
located,
and
that
lien
has
sufficient
capacity
to
bind
the
land.
if
you
look
at
the
early
cases,
justice
o'connor,
with
respect
to
mortgages,
we
have
to
be
careful,
i
think,
in
looking
at
these
cases
that
we
don't
become
hidebound
by
the
common
law's
emphasis
on
the
form
of
the
transaction.
at
common
law,
a
mortgage
took
the
form
of
a
straight
conveyance
of
title,
but
it
was
always
subject
to
defeasance.
the
mortgagor
had
an
equity
of
redemption.
the
mortgagee
was
never
entitled
to
realize
any
more
from
the
property
than
the
amount
of
the
secured
interest.
the
mortgagor's
spouse
even
retained
dollar.
the
mortgagee's
spouse
did
not.
with
respect
to
real
property...
and
none
of
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
government
here
involve
real
property.
they
all
involve
personal
property.
in
cases
of
real
property,
a
lien
can
be
perfected
if
it
is
filed
after
entry
of
judgment
and
indexed
in
accordance
with
state
law.
that
was
done
here,
and
that
lien
was,
therefore,
perfected
with
respect
to
real
property
within
the
county
where
it
was
recorded.
now,
if
the
government's
theory
is
correct,
it
should
apply
to
mortgage
liens
as
well,
and
mortgages
are
liens
in
30
state
jurisdictions.
there's
no
reason
to
distinguish
between
a
mortgage
lien
and
a
judgment
creditor's
lien,
which
has
a
history
at
least
at
long
and
as
enforceable
as
a
mortgage
lien.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that
is
correct.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
the
way
pennsylvania
works,
your
honor,
and
at
that
point,
that
lien
is
immediately
enforceable
without
any
further
judicial
proceedings
of
any
kind,
as
was
the
case
in
united
states/texas,
a
case
on
which
the
government
relies
here.
the
mortgage,
or
the
certified
copy
of
the
judgment
is
taken
to
the
county
recorder,
it
is
indexed,
and
it
is
placed
on
the
land
records.
it
is
therefore
specific
with
respect
to
any
land
that
is
located
within
that
county,
and
it
binds
that
property.
there
is
no
way
in
which
a
mortgagee
or
a
judgment
lien
creditor
can
protect
themselves
against
the
kind
of
theory
that's
asserted
by
the
government
here.
do
you
realize
that
400,000
dollars
of
this
490,000
dollar
tax
lien,
or
tax
claim,
as
the
government
would
prefer
to
say,
was
for
tax
years
that
were
after
the
time
when
this
judgment
was
entered,
indexed,
and
perfected
as
a
lien
under
pennsylvania
law?
the
commercial
mortgage
market
would
be
in
total
chaos
if
that
theory
were
to
be
accepted.
let
me
address
next
the
question
of
the
interaction
of
these
two
statutes.
the
government
would
make
it
appear
that
the
only
issue
here
is
whether
there
is
an
implied
exception
to
the
priority
statute,
when
in
fact
the
issue
is
really
whether
there
is
an
implied
exception
to
one
statute
or
an
implied
limitation
on
another,
as
i
think
justice
breyer
suggested.
there
are
really
two
separate
and
distinct
questions
presented
by
this
phase
of
the
case.
first,
whether
the
competing
statutes
are
inconsistent
within
some
range
of
overlapping
application.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
when
you
say
a
higher
standard,
your
honor,
i
assume
that
you
are
referring
to
the
test
in
united
states
v.
key,
where
the
court
set
forth
a
threepart
test--
first,
is
there
a
facial
inconsistency,
or
a
logical
inconsistency
between
the
two
statutes,
secondly,
would
application
of
the
priority
statute
make
the
subsequently
enacted
and
more
specific
statute
redundant,
or
does
the
legislative
history
in
any
way
suggest
a
congressional
intention
to
carve
out
an
exception
to
the
priority
statute?
i
submit
that
while
it
is
doubtful
in
my
mind
that
in
a
case
that
didn't
even
involve
an
inconsistency
the
court
was
setting
forth
an
overarching
test
to
resolve
all
of
these
cases,
i
submit
the
situation
here
does
satisfy
the
test
that
was
set
forth
in
united
states
v.
key.
to
begin
with,
the
competing
statutes
are
inconsistent,
and
they
are
inconsistent
in
the
very
area
presented
by
this
case.
the
relative
priority
of
the
government
depends
upon
which
statute
applies.
and,
justice
breyer,
it
doesn't
make
sense
for
the
government
to
argue
that,
well,
we
are
here
as
a
tax
claimant
as
well
as
a
lienholder,
and
we
would
prefer
to
proceed
as
the
holder
of
a
tax
claim
rather
than
as
a
lienholder.
if
you
think
about
that,
it's
another
way
of
saying
that
the
government
should
stand
in
a
better
position
as
an
unsecured
creditor
than
as
a
secured
creditor,
something
that
professor
kennedy,
the
leading
commentator
in
this
area,
said
was
quite
paradoxical,
that
the
government
should
be
better
off--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--as
an
unsecured
than
as
a
secured
creditor.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that
universe
is
one
where
the
tax
lien
would
have
no...
tax
lien
statute
would
have
no
significance
whatsoever,
as
the
chief
justice
pointed
out
earlier.
if
the
debtor
is
solvent,
there
is
no
need
for
these
carefully
crafted
priorities
in
section
6326(a).
if
the
debtor
is
solvent,
everyone
is
going
to
paid.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
pardon,
your
honor?
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
and
that
very
limited
area
of
cases
is
hardly
what
congress
had
in
mind--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--in
crafting
this.
there
isn't.
the
government
says,
in
an
effort
really
to
prove
that
the
priority
statute
is
really
the
more
limited
and
specific
statute,
that
the
tax
lien
act
would
have
application
to
cases
involving
solvent
debtors,
where,
of
course,
it
wouldn't
be
necessary,
and
secondly
in
bankruptcy
cases.
contrary
to
what
the
government
suggests,
priorities
in
bankruptcy
are
determined
by
sections
724
and
726
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
not
the
tax
lien
act,
and
the
government's
reliance
on
terwilliger
here
is
misplaced.
there
is
no
reference
to
the
tax
lien
act
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
nor
does
the
tax
lien
act
apply
with
full
force
when
a
trustee
in
bankruptcy,
acting
under
section
544
of
the
bankruptcy
code,
which
gives
the
trustee
status
of
a
hypothetical
judgment
lien
creditor
at
the
outset
of
a
bankruptcy
proceeding,
to
determine
what
liens
would
survive
the
bankruptcy,
which
secured
liens
might
exist.
the
trustee
would
refer
to
the
tax
lien
act
to
determine
if
a
federal
tax
lien
were
involved,
it
had
been
perfected,
but
then
the
priorities
of
the
bankruptcy
statute
would
kick
in
to
determine
how
these
payment
would
be
made
and
to
whom
and
in
what
order,
and
in
that
situation,
your
honor,
the
government
would
apply
in
the
third
category
and
in
the
sixth
category,
not
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
the
tax
lien
act.
this
is
the
basic
structural
flaw
in
the
government's
case.
if
you
accept
this
theory,
the
tax
lien
act
has
application
only
to
cases
where
its
carefully
crafted
protections
of
other
creditors
would
have
no
significance,
and
it
would
also
be
inconsistent
with
what
this
court
itself
said
in
the
kimbell
foods
case,
and
that
is
that
this
statute
represents
congressional
disapproval
of
the
unrestricted
federal
priority
in
tax
matters.
now,
i
don't
think
that
congress
took
the
time
to
craft
this
very
detailed
statute
in
order
to
have
it
apply
only
to
situations
where
it
would
have
no
significance,
and
where
its
priorities
would
be
rendered
totally
ineffective,
but
that
is
what
the
government's
position
is.
going
back,
justice
o'connor,
to
the
key
test,
i
think
i've
already
demonstrated
there
is
an
inconsistency
between
the
statutes,
because
the
priority
depends
upon
which
statute
is
applied.
secondly,
as
i've
just
discussed,
the
tax
lien
act
would
be
totally
redundant,
as
would,
i
might
add,
other
federal
lien
statutes
if
the
government's
theory
is
to
be
accepted.
if
you
have
a
solvent
debtor,
it
doesn't
matter
if
you
have
a
lien
or
not,
you're
going
to
be
paid.
now,
with
respect
to
the
legislative
history,
the
government
points
to
two
proposals
that
were
advanced
by
the
aba
in
1959
and
again
in
1970
by
way
of
amendment
to
the
federal
tax
lien...
or,
excuse
me,
to
the
priority
statute.
those
amendments
went
far
beyond
any
issue
that
is
involved
in
this
case.
this
court
has
always
been
reluctant
to
draw
any
inference
from
congressional
inaction,
and
i
submit
in
this
case
it
would
be
totally
inappropriate
to
do
so
because
of
the
breadth
of
the
amendments--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
in
the
final
report
of
the
aba,
which
is
referred
to
in
the
legislative
history,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
the
aba
at
that
point
thought
that
one
of
the
proposals
that
was
being
advanced
was
really
to
clarify
that
traditional
security
interests
have
always
survived
assertion
of
priority
by
the
government
under
the
statute.
in
other
words,
with
respect
to
that
specific
proposal,
which
was
part
of
a
much
larger
package,
the
aba
was
of
the
view
that
they
were
really
conforming
law
to
what
traditionally
it
had
understood
to
be,
contrary
to
the
suggestion
in
some
cases.
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute
in
terms
of
how
the
structure
of
the
statute
has
evolved
over
time,
i
think
it
is
also
clear
that
we
meet
the
test
set
forth
in
the
united
states
v.
key.
this
is
a
statute
that
started
out
as
a
means
of
facilitating
tax
collection
on
the
part
of
the
government.
over
the
years,
there
has
been
a
steady
expansion
of
the
protection
afforded
to
competing
creditors,
and
if
you
look
at
the
committee
report
of
the
1913
statute,
congress
was
of
the
view
at
that
time
that
they
were
putting
these
other
creditors
on
an
equal
footing
with
the
government
in
tax
matters.
in
1966,
the
1966
amendments,
which
gave
even
unsecured
creditors,
justice
breyer,
priority
over
a
properly
filed
and
perfected
federal
tax
lien,
congress
said
that
these
amendments
were
designed
to
bring
the
federal
tax
lien
act
in
conformity
with
the
provisions
of
the
uniform
commercial
code,
and
under
article
9
of
the
uniform
commercial
code,
secured
claims
are
always
given
preference
over
unsecured
claims.
so
i
think
that
in
terms
of
whether
we
have
satisfied
the
standards
set
forth
in
the
united
states
v.
key,
it
is
clear
that
we
have.
with
respect
to
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
government,
i
want
to
emphasize
that
in
the
case
of
new
york
v.
maclay
you
had
a
situation
of
a
state
lien,
state
franchise
tax
lien
that
was
designed
to
cover
all
property
of
the
debtor
that
were
accrued
in
advance
of
the
years
in
which
the
amount
of
taxes
were
due,
so
you
had
an
amount
that
was
undetermined,
you
had
property
that
was
undetermined.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
it
would
not
have
been
a
perfected
lien
under
the
uniform
commercial
code
or
under
any
other
standard,
justice
scalia,
that
i
can
consider.
the
same
was
true
of
united
states
v.
texas,
another
case
on
which
the
government
relies
very
heavily.
in
that
case,
the
amount
of
the
lien
was
undetermined.
it
required
judicial
proceedings
to
determine
the
amount.
the
property
there
was
not
only
all
property
used
in
the
business,
but
all
property
that
might
thereafter
be
acquired,
far
different
from
the
property
in
this
case
located
within
the
county
in
which
this
judgment
was
entered,
indexed,
and
perfected
as
a
lien.
every
other
case
that
is
relied
upon
by
the
government
involved...
and
which
turned
on
possession
of
the
property
involved,
was
a
case
involving
personal
property.
liens
on
personal
property
at
common
law
required
the
creditor
to
take
possession
of
the
collateral.
if
the
creditor
did
not
have
possession
of
the
collateral,
there
was
no
lien
at
common
law.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no,
that--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--now
you
can
make
the
filing
with
the
ucc,
but
at
common
law,
absent
possession
of
the
collateral,
the
creditor
was
not
deemed
to
have
a
lien.
in
fact,
any
lien
on
personal
property
absent
possession
was
deemed
to
be
fraudulent.
so
all
of
these
cases
on
which
the
government
relies,
the
socalled
modern
cases,
are
really
just
reaffirming,
in
the
case
of
personal
property,
traditional
common
law
principles.
the
case
is
different,
the
considerations
are
different
with
respect
to
real
property.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
well,
the--
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
--well,
in
terms
of...
no,
today
in
terms
of
personal
property
with
a
ucc
filing
you
can
obtain
a
lien
on
personal
property.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
what
i'm
talking
about
are
the
cases
involving
state
tax
liens,
where
personal
property
was
involved
and
this
court
said,
absent
divestiture
of
title
or
possession
of
the
property
you
don't
have
a
perfected
lien
on
personal
property.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
right,
your
honor,
and
all
of
the
cases
that
the
government
relies
on
have
turned
on
the
requirement
of
possession
for
the
property,
as
enunciated
in
thelusson
v.
smith,
have
involved
personal
property.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
correct,
justice
souter,
and
i
think
that,
too,
is
really
why
stare
decisis
is
not
implicated
here,
in
addition
to
several
other
reasons,
but
these
cases
on
which
they
rely
do
involve
personal
property
and
not
real
property,
and
if
we're
talking
about
stare
decisis
we
have
to
go
back
to
conard
v.
atlantic
insurance
company,
and
there
the
court
was
of
the
view
that
thelusson
should
be
limited
to
its
facts,
and
that
the
requirement
that
the
judgment
creditor
obtain
title
or
possession
of
the
property
was
limited
to
the
facts
in
that
case.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
no.
thelusson
was
real
property,
your
honor,
but
in
thelusson
the
judgment
creditor
was
attempting
to
reach
the
proceeds
of
the
sale
of
the
property
and,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
conard,
what
the
judgment
creditor
should
have
done
was
to
proceed
against
the
land
rather
than
the
proceeds
from
the
sale
of
the
land,
and
that
is
why
thelusson
was
being
limited
to
what
the
court
said
were
its
circumstances.
the
court
was
very
emphatic
that
thelusson
did
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
perfected
lien
could
be
displaced
by
the
mere
priority
of
the
government
under
revised
statute
section
3466.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg.
in
1857
the
attorney
general's
opinion
was
to
the
effect
that
thelusson
had
been
overruled,
not
just
limited
to
the
circumstances
of
the
case,
and
that
the
priority
statute
would
not
reach
back
over
liens
general
or
specific
that
were
antecedent
to
the
accrual
of
the
government's
claim.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
my
position,
i
think,
would
require
you
to
at
least
distinguish
it,
your
honor.
conard,
if
you
accept
what
the
court
said
in
conard,
that
thelusson
did
not
stand
for
the
proposition
that
a
perfected
lien
could
be
overcome
by
the
priority
statute,
then
consistent
with
conard
you
don't
have
to
overrule
it.
mr.
patrick
f.
mccartan
you
see
what
i
mean,
though,
that
the
distinction
made
in
conard
would
permit
the
court
to
proceed
on
the
basis
of
conard
without
addressing
specifically
the
issue
of
whether
thelusson
should
be
overruled.
as
this
court
said
in
rankin,
the
judgment
lien
does
follow
the
property
and
can
be
foreclosed,
even
in
the
case
where
a
junior
lienholder
or
unsecured
creditor
has
moved
against
the
property
in
the
first
instance.
i
submit
that
the
government's
position
in
this
case,
and
we
are
talking
about
real
property,
confuses
what
is
necessary
to
perfect
a
lien
with
respect
to
that
property
with
satisfaction
of
the
underlying
judgment.
requiring
a
creditor
to
take
possession
of
the
property
or
to
foreclose
on
the
lien
is
a
means
of
satisfying
the
underlying
obligation.
it
is
not
required
to
perfect
the
lien
under
modern
recording
statutes,
and
the
only
cases
that
would
indicate
to
the
contrary
are
cases
that
have
involved
unspecified
personal
property
or
real
property
that
could
not
be
identified.
in
this
case,
the
property
is
clearly
identified,
the
identity
of
the
lienor
is
clear,
the
amount
of
the
lien
has
been
established,
and
the
property
is
located
within
the
county
in
which
the
lien
was
perfected.
we
satisfy
the
test
in
united
states/key,
in
united
states
v.
campbell,
and
i
submit
that
the
judgment
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
should
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
