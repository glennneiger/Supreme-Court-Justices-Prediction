chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1613,
united
states
v.
the
estate
of
francis
romani.
mr.
jones,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
know
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but,
you
know
we
don't
always
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
legislative
history.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
committee
says
in
that
regard.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well
then,
what's
the
point
of
6321
and
6323(a),
which
deal
specifically
with
tax
liens?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
the
new
britain
case
they
discussed
at
great
length
the
tax
lien
statutes,
too,
did
they
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
would
that
have
been
necessary
if
the
only
holding
of
the
case
was
that
it's
governed
by
the
absolute
priority
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--united
states
v.
massachusetts
was
a
5
to
4
decision,
so
it
has
less
claim
to
stare
decisis
than--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
are
you
saying
that
priorities,
lien,
or
debt
priority
statutes
come
into
play
in
a
majority
of
cases
where
there
is
no
insolvency?
that
seems
odd
to
me.
i
would
think
the
time
that
it
would
be
most
useful
and
probably
most
applicable
is
when
there
is
some
sort
of
insolvency.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
put
that--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
did
congress
give
it
to
you
if
you
didn't
need
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
jones.
mr.
mccartan,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
arizona,
where
i
practiced,
if
you
got
a
judgment
you
would
have
to
take
a...
get
a
certified
copy
of
the
judgment
from
the
clerk
of
the
court
and
take
it
to
the
county
recorder,
and
the
county
recorder
would
record
it
the
same
way
it
would
record
a
mortgage.
is
that
the
way
pennsylvania
procedure
works,
too?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
isn't
what
we're
talking
about
here
real
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccartan.
mr.
jones,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
should
they
be
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it...
was
the
distinction,
or
they're
saying
they're
different
based
on
the
difference
in
language
in
the
statutes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
the
case
is
submitted.
