mr.
kent
l.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
on
the
date
of
his
death
francis
romani
owned
real
property
worth
about
50,000
dollars.
that
property
was
subject
to
a
private
judgment
lien
and
to
a
laterfiled
federal
tax
lien.
both
of
the
liens
were
for
amounts
that
exceeded
the
value
of
the
estate,
and
the
estate
therefore
brought
this
case
to
determine
whether
the
claim
of
the
united
states
or
the
claim
of
the
private
judgment
creditor
should
be
paid
first.
the
answer
to
that
question
appears
in
the
direct
text
of
what
is
known
as
the
absolute
priority
statute.
since
1797,
that
statute
has
provided
a
simple
rule
for
the
narrow
category
of
cases
in
which
the
united
states
seeks
to
recover
a
claim
against
an
insolvent
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
when
congress
enacted
that
provision
in
1982
they
said
it
was
a
formal
change
of
language
that
was
not
intended
to
change
the
scope
of
the
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
language
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
language
is
different,
but
congress
didn't
intend
it
to
have
a
different
meaning,
but
moreover--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's...
the
legislative
history--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's...
you
may
not
always
pay
a
lot
of
attention
to
it,
but
in
the
context
where
a
change
has
been
made
to
words,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
changed
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
it's
appropriate
to
look
to
the
legislative
history,
especially
when
congress
says
in
that
history,
we're
not
changing
the
meaning.
that
should
be
authoritative.
but--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that's
correct.
there
is
an
answer,
i
think,
in
any
event
to
your
question
apart
from
that,
and
that
is...
i
may
be...
i
may
have
the
wrong
case,
but
i
think
it's
united
states
v.
moore
where
the
court
said
that
whether
the
claim
is
unliquidated
or
not,
it's
still
covered
by
the
absolute
priority
statute.
but
the
importance
of
the
absolute
priority
statute
is
that
it
provides
the
simple
rule
that
the
united
states
shall
be
paid
first.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
that's
indeed
the
ultimate
question
in
the
case.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
does
that
statute
change
the
application
of
the
absolute
priority
statute
for
tax
claims?
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
said
that
it
did,
and
we
say
it
doesn't.
the
rationale
of
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
was
that
this
tax
lien
statute
provides
a
limitation
on
the
effectiveness
of
the
federal
tax
lien,
and
that
by
limiting
the
validity
of
the
lien,
you
limit
the
priority
of
the
united
states,
but
in
united
states
v.
key
and
united
states
v.
emory
the
court
said
that
only
the
plainest
inconsistency
between
two
statutory
schemes
would
justify
disregarding
this
ancient
and
clear
command
that
the
united
states
be
paid
first.
there
is
no
claim
inconsistency
between
these
statutory
schemes.
the
absolute
priority
statute
is
a
priority
statute.
it
does
not
require
any
lien
of
the
united
states.
in
united
states
v.
city
of
new
britain,
and
united
states
v.
vermont,
this
court
held
exactly
that,
that
the
right
of
the
united
states
under
the
absolute
priority
statute
exists
wholly
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
any
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes,
because
that--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--because
in
the
new
britain
case
the
debtor
was
solvent.
the
absolute
priority
statute
did
not,
by
its
terms,
apply,
and
the
very
important
part
of
that
opinion
for
this
purpose
is
what
the
court
went
on
to
say
about
how
the
tax
lien
act
applies
in
that
situation.
what
the
court
said
was,
the
tax
lien
act
only
determines
the
validity
of
the
federal
lien.
it
does
not,
by
its
terms,
contain
any
priority
provisions.
it
does
not
set
a
priorities,
it
is
a
lien
statute,
and
the
court
said
that
to
determine
priorities
we
look
to
the
background
common
law
rule
of
first
in
time
is
first
in
right,
unless
that
has
been
modified
by
statute,
and
the
court
pointed
out
that
in
the
insolvency
situations
to
which
the
absolute
priority
statute
applies,
it
has
been
modified
by
statute.
congress
provided
specifically
since
1797
that
in
the
narrow
category
of
cases
involving
insolvent
estates
the
united
states
is
to
be
paid
first.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
congress
specifically
has
provided
that
bankruptcy
cases
are
to
be
determined
not
under
the
absolute
priority
statute
but
under
the
priority
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
code.
it's
not
illogical
for
congress
to
determine
that
one
set
of
priority
rules
apply
in
one
context
and
a
different
apply
in
different
contexts.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
absolutely.
congress
said
that,
but
more
important...
well,
equally
importantly,
this
court
has
said
that
no
less
than
seven
times
in
the
last
180
years.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that
takes
us
to
the
heart
of
an
ancient
dispute
that
this
court
has,
by
its
express
statements,
never
resolved.
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
court--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--in
new
york
v.
maclay,
for
example,
the
court
said
a
mortgage
is
more
than
a
lien,
that
it
is
closer
to
a
title
and
possession
of
the
property,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
would--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
would
concede
it
to
this
extent.
the
court
so
stated
that
in
thelusson.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
court
confirmed
that
in
the
maclay
case,
but
i
believe
it
was
in
either
mass...
united
states
v.
massachusetts
or
united
states
v.
texas,
in
one
of
those
two
opinions
when
they
were
reciting
the
wellestablished
rule
about
we
prevail
against
judgment
liens
but
we
may
not
prevail
against
mortgages,
the
court
said
something
to
the
effect
that
if
the
mortgage
cases
are
still
valid.
now...
and
so
i
suppose
that
what
the
court
was
saying
then
was,
they
weren't
revisiting
to
decide
whether
the
mortgage
case--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i'm...
i'm
just--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--okay.
that
issue--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court
has
always
held
that
we
prevail
against
the
general
lien
of
the
judgment.
the
question
of
whether
we
prevail
against
a
mortgage
isn't
presented
in
this
case.
the
question
in
particular--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
i'm...
my
position
is
that
the
court
has
twice
held
that
we
lose
to
a
mortgage,
and
has
once
said
that
it's
not
certain
that
that's
good
law.
i
really
don't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--no,
con--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--congress--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--first
of
all--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
absolute
priority
statute
doesn't
create
a
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
not
a...
it's
not
that
kind
of
a
magic
word,
and
this
court
has
made
the
very
distinction
on
this
subject,
and
so
it's
important
for
me
to
emphasize
it.
the
right
of
the
united
states
under
the
absolute
priority
statute
does
not
depend
upon
the
existence
of
any
lien,
valid
or
not.
it
defeats
any...
what
the
court
has
described
in
i
think
seven
cases
that
we've
cited.
it
defeats
anything
that
is
a
quote,
general
lien,
which
is
a
lien
that
does
not...
as
the
court
said
in
thelusson
all
the
way
to
gilbert
associates,
a
general
lien
does
not
divest
title
or
possession
from
the
united
states.
the
property
remains
in
the
debtor's
estate
and
therefore
the
united
states
is
to
be
paid
first.
and
so,
is
the...
so
the
question
that
i
believe
was
implicit
in
your
remark
was,
is
a
mechanic's
lien
a
general
lien
covered...
you
know,
which
the
united
states
prevails,
or
is
it
a
specific
lien
that
might
come
in
ahead
of
the
united
states
under
the
absolute
priority
statute.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
my
perception
of
that
is
that
if
the
court
had
to
reach
it,
under
its
precedent
it
would
hold
that
it
was
a
general
lien,
although
it
could
hold
it
was
a
specific--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it's
certainly
not
exactly
like
a
mortgage.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
saying
what
our
position
is
on
mechanic's
liens,
because
i
can
hear
an
argument
to
be
made
for
saying,
oh,
that's
a
specific
lien
within
the
context
of
how
the
court
uses
that
term.
but
let's
take
the
judgment
lien,
which
is
also
referred
to
in
6323,
and
which
the
court's
opinions
say
clearly
we
prevail
against
under
the
absolute
priority
statute.
did
congress
intend,
in
adopting
6323,
to
repeal
the
application
of
the
absolute
priority
statute
to
judgment
liens?
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
why?
because
at
the
same...
in
terms
of
intent,
at
the
same
time
that
the
repealing
legislation
was
presented
for...
i
mean,
that
the
federal
tax
lien
legislation
was
presented
to
congress
in
1966,
congress
was
also
presented
with
three
bills
designed
expressly
to
repeal
the
application
of
this
statute
to
tax
claims.
congress
conducted
hearings
on
those
legislation,
informed
itself
of
the
objections,
and
declined
to
enact
it.
4
years
later,
the
same
repealing
legis--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
sense
that
it--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--the
sense
that
it
makes
is,
when
the
tax
lien
provisions
are
applicable,
they're
applicable
within
a
priority
context
determined
by
some
other
statute
or
legislation.
in
the
situation
you've
described,
if
he
goes
into
bankruptcy,
then
it's
the
bankruptcy
code
that
prevails,
the
bankruptcy
code
that
is
operative.
all
that
the
tax
lien
provisions
say
is
whether
we
have
a
valid
lien,
and
then
you
should
ask,
so
what
if
we
don't
have
a
valid
lien,
and
the
answer
under
the
absolute
priority
statute
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--it
doesn't
matter.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
one
of
the
reasons
we
don't
address
that
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
is
because
all
of
that
portion
of
their
argument
relates
to
an
issue
that
wasn't
raised
below,
which
is
whether
this
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
can
defend
it
on
a
ground
that
wasn't
even
raised
below.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
or
addressed
below.
they--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
the--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--if
the
court
were
going
to
revisit
the
question
of
whether
the
judgment
lien
was
subject
to
the
absolute
priority
statute
i
would
think
it
would
want
to
do
that
in
a
context
where
it
was
raised
below,
because
the
court
has
already
decided
that
issue
seven
times.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
stare
decisis
would
also
suggest--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
what
the
court
would
do
would
be
to
apply
thelusson,
gilbert
associates,
united
states
v.
texas,
united
states
v.
massachusetts,
city
of
new
britain
and
vermont,
and
say--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
it
was
just
one
of
a
long
string
of
decisions,
and
my
point
is
simply
that
this
is
wellsettled
since
1817.
if
the
court
wants
to
revisit
the
issue,
i
would
think
it
would
do
it
in
a
case
where
we
had
an
opportunity
to
brief
it
in
the
courts
below
and
fully
here,
instead
of
just
in
a
reply
brief.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
i...
that's
not
my
only
answer.
that
opinion
was
in
1850-something.
it
was...
what
it
really
was,
and
what
the
opinion
reflects,
is
that
it
was
an
issue
about
whether
a
mortgage
takes
priority
under
the
absolute
priority
statute,
and
the
court
cited
conard,
and
maybe
thelusson,
but
certainly
conard
for
that
proposition,
which...
we
don't
intend
to
dispute
conard.
we
don't
intend
to
dispute
that
a
mortgage...
this
court
has
held
that
a
mortgage
takes
priority,
and--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
when
justice
o'connor
asked
me
that,
it's
sort
of
like...
well,
i...
i'm
not
trying
to
reformulate
the
court's
cases.
i'm
trying
to
describe
them,
and
the
court's
cases
have
contained
that
last
caveat
about,
well,
whether
that
is
still
good
law.
we
don't
place
that
at
issue
in
this
case.
but
getting
back
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
why
does
this
make
sense,
this
makes
sense
because
congress
has
provided
priorities
for
cases
involving
bankrupts
in
the
bankruptcy
code.
congress
has
provided
by
indirection
cases
for
insolvents,
which
is
that
they
haven't
changed
the
common
law
rule
of
first
in
time,
and
that's
what
the
court
held
in
city
of
new
britain.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
the
priority
here
is
we're
paid
first.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
no,
the
priority
in
an
insolvent
estate
is
the
absolute
priority
statute,
and
that's
we're
paid
first.
these
are
different
rules.
congress--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--that
is...
well,
i
wouldn't
think
you'd
say
that
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
one
is,
the
court
doesn't
apply
that
method
of
analysis
to
the
absolute
priority
statute,
but
even
if
it
did,
which
of
these
provisions
is
more
specific,
which
is
a
point
i've
been
trying
to
get
up
to.
the
absolute
priority
statute
is
a
very
narrow
statute.
it
has
an
extremely
narrow
scope
of
operation.
it
only
applies
in
these
narrow
categories
of
cases
involving
insolvent
estates
and
a
few
other
narrow
insolvency
situations.
the
dominant
majority
of
cases
are
governed
by
other
priority
provisions.
bankruptcy
cases,
solvency--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
in
the
vast
majority
of
those
cases
they're
in
the
bankruptcy
code,
covered
by
the
bankruptcy
code.
i
mean,
we
know
congress
intended
to
have
two
different
priority
schemes,
because
the
absolute
priority
statute
specifically
excepts
bankruptcy
cases
from
its
application.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
that
deals
with
tax
liens,
and
that's
the
point,
because
congress
certainly
knew
full
well
that
this
court
had
held
in
thelusson
in
1817
and
in
the
several
cases
in
the
fifties,
like
city
of
new
britain,
knew
full
well
that
this
court
had
held
that
you
don't
need
a
tax
lien.
it
doesn't
matter
if
you
don't
have
a
valid
tax
lien
under
the...
in
the
narrow
situations
that
the
absolute
priority
statute
applies,
and
so
you
have
to
understand
that
these
statutes
really
operate
in
different...
on
different
issues.
every
federal
court
that
has
considered
this
has
recognized
that
the
priority
statute
establishes
priorities,
the
lien
statute
deals
with
liens.
these
are
different
subjects.
there's
no
inconsistency
between
these
two
provisions
because
they
both
have
full
application
in
the
separate
contexts
that
they
apply.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--you
can't
come
to
that
conclusion--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--after
reading
the
city
of
new
britain
opinion,
because
the
city
of
new
britain
opinion
says
that
in
the
insolvency
situation
congress
has
provided
specific
priorities,
and
we
win
without
regard
to
the
existence
of
any
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
it's
not
so
much
that
there's
something
special
about
it.
it's
that
the
statutes
have
different
words,
they
have
different
histories,
they
have
different
purposes,
they
do
not
conflict
if
you
take
them
each
at
their
fair
reading.
the...
okay,
let's
say
the
fair
reading
is,
this
is
a
judgment
lien,
our
lien
would
not
be
valid
against
it.
the
next
question
is--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
that
that's
a--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--vast
overstatement
again.
i
mean,
they
cite
a
case
called
marshall
v.
new
york,
where
the
court
says
that
the
common
law
rule
was
that
specific
liens,
only
specific
liens
prevail--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i...
they
didn't
correctly
describe
the
law
in
england
as
this
court
described
it
in
marshall.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
as
far
as
what
the
law
in
england
was
before,
this
court
has
said
it
doesn't
matter,
because
in
united
states
v.
moore,
and
all
the
way
back
in
1824,
i
think,
in
the
bank
of
north
carolina
case,
the
court
said
that
whatever
the
common
law
rule
is,
this
priority
of
the
united
states
arises
solely
by
statute,
and
it
is
interpreting
that
statute
that
the
court
has
said,
seven
times
since
1817,
that
a
general
lien
such
as
a
judgment
lien,
or
a
state
and
municipal
tax
lien,
or
a
landlord's
lien
does
not
prevail
against
the
absolute
priority
of
the
united
states.
and
in
city
of
new
britain
they
said
we
don't
need
a
lien
in
these
cases.
a
lien...
and
or
repeated
that
same
conclusion
in
united
states
v.
vermont.
the
lien...
the
existence
of
a
lien
is
a
security
device.
it's
not
a
right
to
payment.
we
don't
have
a
lien,
so
when
there's
property...
in
the
absolute
priority
situation,
when
there's
property
possessed
by
the
insolvent
estate,
if
it's
transferred
out
of
the
estate
we
don't
have
a
lien
that
follows
it,
and
the
absence
of
such
a
lien
doesn't
affect
our
right
to
be
paid
out
of
the
property
of
the
estate.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
yes.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
i
think
a
purchase
money
mortgage--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i
think
a
purchase
money
mortgage
would
plainly
be
the
sort
of
thing
this
court
would
hold
as
a
practical
matter
would
hold
it's
a
specific
lien
that
prevails
against
the
absolute
priority
of
the
united
states.
i
think
that
much
is
clear,
to
answer
your
question.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
court
has
never
decided
that
question,
and
has
specifically
avoided
it,
so
i
can't
tell
you
how
you'd
decide
it.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
the
theory
that
the
court
has
is
that
to
be
specific
for
purposes
of
the
absolute
priority
statute
you
have
to
divest
title
or
possession
of
the
good
from
the
debtor's
estate
before
the
claim
of
the
united
states
arises.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
justice
cardozo
who
addressed
that
very
point
in
new
york
v.
maclay,
and
he
said,
well,
i
don't
have...
i
can't
decide
now
whether
a
lien
state
the
mortgage
would
win,
but,
he
says,
this...
a
mortgage
is
more
than
a...
more
than
merely
a
lien,
he
said.
it's
more
akin
to
title.
it's
more
akin
to
possession.
now,
there's
a
reason
why
the
court
hasn't
had
to
address
that
question.
the
reason
is
that
it
has
never
had
a
case
before
that
presented
anything
other
than
a
general
lien
that
did
not
divest
title
and
possession,
and
so
that
boundary
is
still
out
there.
it...
but
it's
never
been
defined
by
the
court
other
than
in
thelusson,
and
it...
they
said,
well,
it's
title
or
possession--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
the
court
has
followed
that
for
180
years.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
that's
6321.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
6323--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--and
says
it
won't
be
valid--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--right.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
but
we
don't--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--well,
that...
i'm
sorry,
i--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--i'm
just
surprised
at
that
suggestion.
the
court...
i
can't
remember
the
case,
but
i'm
quite
confident
that
the
court
has
said
that
the
tax
lien
provisions
supplement
the
right
of
the
united
states
to
recover
a
tax.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
i
think
it
obviously
is.
every
lien
is
a
supplement
to
the
underlying
claim.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
substi...
it
doesn't
replace
the
claim.
it's
a
security
device.
the
question
is,
do
we
need
it?
no,
we
don't.
the
court
has
so
held.
we
don't
need
that
lien.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
well,
we
don't
need
it
in
the
absolute
priority,
in
the
narrow
categories
of
the
absolute
priority
statute,
because
there
we
have
a
right
to
be
paid
first.
when
those
priorities
aren't
applicable,
yes,
we
benefit
from
the
lien
in
other
priority
contexts.
congress
intended
these
priority
rules
to
apply
here,
intended
other
priority
rules
to
apply
elsewhere.
i've
got
just
a
few
minutes
left.
i
only
want
to
make
one
other
point
at
this
time,
and
that
is
that
respondent
claims
that
this
ancient
statute
should
be
modernized
to
avoid
an
inconvenience
to
creditors.
the
simple
answer
to
that
is
what
the
court
said
in
emory.
whatever
the
merits
of
that
objection
should
be
made
to
congress,
not
the
court.
and
that
brings
me
to
the
point
that
these
objections
were
raised
with
congress
twice.
in
'66
and
'70,
congress
conducted
hearings
on
them
and
declined
to
make
the
changes
that
respondent
now
asks
this
court
to
make.
going
all
the
way
back
to
1805,
in
the
first
case
that
this
court
decided
under
the
absolute
priority
statute,
chief
justice
marshall
said
for
this
court
that
the
inconvenience
of
the
statute
did
not
justify
its
judicial
nullification,
and
for
that
reason
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court's
decision
should
be
reversed.
i'd
like
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
thank
you.
there
are
basically
two
propositions
respondent
makes.
one
is
that
the
court
should
disclaim
reliance
on
a
distinction
that's
recognized
for
180
years,
from
thelusson
through
gilbert
associates,
between
a
general
lien
that
does
not
defeat
the
absolute
priority
of
the
united
states
and
a
more
specific
lien
that
may.
the
court
has
held...
i'm
repeating
myself,
probably,
but
i
think
seven
times
that
a
judgment
lien
is
such
a
general
lien
and
that
the
priority
of
the
united
states
prevails
against
it.
it's
said
it
not
only
with
respect
to
personal
property,
it's
said
it
at
least
twice
with
respect
to
real
property.
in
united
states
v.
texas
in
1941
the
court
said,
and
i'm
quoting
from
page
7
of
our
brief,
but
i'm
quoting
the
court's
opinion,
a
general
judgment
lien
upon
the
land
of
an
insolvent
debtor
does
not
take
precedence
over
claims
of
the
united
states
unless
execution
of
the
judgment
has
proceeded
far
enough
to
take
the
land
out
of
the
possession
of
the
debtor.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
he's
confusing
something
that
this
court
has
made
clear
shouldn't
be
confused,
and
that
is
the
standards
for
specificity
under
the
federal
tax
lien
act,
as
contrasted
with
the
standards
for
specificity
under
the
absolute
priority
statute.
the
court
in
vermont
and
in
new
britain
made
clear
that
those
are
really
two
entirely
different
questions.
the
question
under
the
federal
tax
lien
act
is,
is
there
a
state
lien,
and
the
answer
is
yes
if
it's
become
definite
in
terms
of
the
name
of
the
lienor,
the
amount
of
the
lien,
and
the
property
to
which
it
applies.
but
as
the
court
explained
in
vermont,
the
question
of
whether
you
have
a
specific
lien
for
purposes
of
the
absolute
priority
statute
is
a
different
one,
and
turns
on
whether,
as
the
court
said
in
that
case,
the
debtor
has
been
divested
of
title
or
possession--
mr.
kent
l.
jones
--they
are
different
because
the
statutes
have
different
scopes
and
application,
which
this
court
has
clearly
held
in
at
least
two
cases
this
century.
mr.
kent
l.
jones
and
the
statute's
objectives,
yes.
i
mean,
it
goes
back
to
the
language.
the
absolute
priority
statute
simply
says
we
get
paid
first,
and
the
question
is,
well,
is
there
something
that
prevents
that
from
happening,
and
the
court's
answer
has
been,
well,
if
the
property
has
been
taken
away
from
the
debtor,
then
you
don't
get
paid
first.
if
it's
been
taken
away
from
the
debtor
by
something
so
specific,
like
a
mortgage,
then
you
don't
get
paid
first,
but
if
it's
just
a
general
claim
against
that
property,
you
still
get
paid
first,
because
it's
still
in
the
possession
of
the
debtor,
and
the
statute
says,
and
the
court
says
we
obey
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
that
the
united
states
gets
paid
first.
to
reach
a
different
conclusion
the
court
would
have
to
overrule
no
less
than
seven
opinions
over
the
last
180
years.
the
cases
that
he
says
are
his
best
cases
for
this
proposition
were
all
in
the
early
part
of
the
19th
century.
they
don't...
as
our
brief
describes,
they
don't
stand
for
the
proposition
that
he
contends.
this
court
has
expressly
limited
the
application
of
those
cases
to
the
mortgage
situation
in
the
maclay,
new
york
v.
maclay,
that's
what
justice
cardozo
carefully
explained.
the
second
argument
that
they
make
is
that
this
statute,
this
application
of
the
absolute
priority
statute
somehow
makes
the
federal
tax
lien
provisions
meaningless,
which
if
you
think
about
it
is
a
preposterous
contention
that
has
absolutely
no
support
for
it.
the
federal
tax
lien
provisions
of
course
apply
in
the
ordinary
situations
that
the
absolute
priority
statute
doesn't
apply.
in
bankruptcy
court,
for
example,
they
will
determine
whose
lien
comes
first,
where
it
matters
whether
your
lien
came
first
or
not.
in
the...
i'm
sorry.
my
time
has
expired.
