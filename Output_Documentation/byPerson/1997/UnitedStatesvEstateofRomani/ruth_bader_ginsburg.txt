justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
are
presenting
the
position
as
though
it's
clear
and
certain
this
is
the
government's
position,
the
only
question
mark
is
what
this
court
may
have
done
in
some
mortgage
cases,
and
yet
the
red
brief
cites
an
attorney
general's
opinion
from
1857.
but
you
don't...
as
far
as
i
remember
don't
address
that
at
all
in--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--mr.
jones--
--but
you
still
haven't
commented--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
jones,
the
government
is
owed
all
kinds
of
money
by
all
kinds
of
people,
and
that's...
the
absolute
priority
statute
could
cover
those
debts,
but
here
we
have
something
that
deals
with
tax
liens,
so
that's
the
specific
subject
matter,
as--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--you
do
concede
that
certain
secured
creditors
can
get
priority
in
an
insolvent
estate
situation,
and
you
would--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--say,
well
the
mortgage...
is
there
anything...
well,
as
to
the
mortgage,
do
you
make
a
distinction
between--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--title
states
and
lien
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
any
other--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--i
just
wondered
what
worked
in
with
your
theory.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
then
in
mortgage
lien
states,
as
distinguished
from
title
states,
then
in
the
lien
states
the
creditor
would
lose.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
that's
the
position
you
say
the
attorney
general
in
that
1857
opinion--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
yet
he--
--your
position
would
require
us
to
overrule
thelusson,
i
think.
