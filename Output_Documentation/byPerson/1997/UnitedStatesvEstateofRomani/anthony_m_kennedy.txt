well,
the
statute
is
different
in
this
respect.
until
the
revision
of
the
statute
in
question,
which
i
think
was
1982,
it
talked
in
terms
of
debt.
3713(a)
at
page
2
of
your
brief
talks
about
claim,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
a...
that
the
word
claim
may
be
quite
different
than
debt.
claim
sounds
to
me
as...
has
the
connotation
of
something
that's
not...
that's
ambulatory,
or
that
hasn't
been
executed
yet,
whereas
debt
sounds
as
if
it's
something
that's
fixed.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
the
language
still
is
different.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
one
is
claim,
and
the
other
is
debt.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
it
apply
to
all
property
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
it
apply
to
all
property
in
the
state
of
pennsylvania--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--or
just
a
particular
county--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--but
there
was
nothing
to
make
it
more
specific
than
that.
then
why
isn't--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
except
the
suggestion
is
that
a
mortgage
is
specific
as
to
property,
and
that
judgment
liens
are
not,
and
whether
or
not
this
court
can
get
into
state
lien
law
as
to
what's
specific
and
what's
general
is
certainly
problematic,
but
that's
the
suggestion.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--it
seems
to
me
unlikely
we're
going
to
base
our
holding
on
that.
we
have
to
assume
that
there
were
five
other
pieces
of
property
in
other
counties,
if
your
reading
of
the
statute
is
correct.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
under
your
submission
if
you
file
it
in
every
county,
then
your
lien
is
good
in
every
county.
