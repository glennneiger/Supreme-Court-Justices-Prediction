mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
is
apparent
from
the
briefs
of
alpa
and
the
amici,
and
from
alpa's
argument
here
today,
alpa
has
no
legal
authority
for
forcing
the
nonmember
pilots
to
use
its
unilaterally
created
agency
fee
review
procedure.
neither
alpa
nor
either
of
its
amici
cites
a
single
case
in
which
this
court
has
required
exhaustion
where
there
was
not
one
of
two
things.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out,
that
requirement
is
a
matter
of
first
amendment
due
process,
and
it
has
to
be
imposed
on
the
union
if
it's
going
to
be
able
to
exercise
its
statutory
privilege
of
collecting
the
service
fee,
which
in
itself
infringes
on
the
first
amendment
rights--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--alpa
selects
the--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
number
2,
the
court
of
appeals
here
held
that
that
independent
auditor
does
not
audit
the
lawfulness
of
the
allocation
of
the
expenses
between
chargeable
and
nonchargeable.
all
the
auditor
does
is
check
the
numbers.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i'll
agree
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
what
i
don't
agree
with,
justice
stevenson,
is
that
it
does
not...
that
hudson
did
require
some
form
of
impartial
decisionmaker
procedure
to
be
made
available--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--primarily...
if
i
may--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
the
cause
of
action,
your
honor,
is
ripe
at
the
time
the
funds
are
taken.
there's
a
deprivation
of
property
at
that
point,
and
even
as
a
matter
of
pure
fifth
amendment
or
fourteenth
amendment
due
process
the
employee
is
normally
entitled
to
a
pre-taking
notice
and
hearing.
now,
i
can't
explain
why
the
court
didn't
make
the
requirement
a
pre-taking
hearing.
apparently
the
court
felt
that
the
union
should
get
possession
of
the
money
and
hold
it
in
escrow
so
that
it
can
later
spend
that
portion
which
goes
to
the
lawfully
chargeable
activities.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
no,
i
don't,
justice
scalia,
because
that's
not
a
hearing.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
not
a
hearing.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it's
not
an
absolute--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--hudson
requires
that.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
hudson
requires
that
that--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--be
done
before
the
money
is
collected.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
what's
wrong
with
that,
your
honor,
is
that
the
individual
employee
has
a
cause
of
action
which
has
been
given
to
him
by
congress,
and
this
court
has
never,
never
held
that
exhaustion
is
required
where
there
is
not
one
of
two
situations,
one,
either
an
agreement
to
arbitrate,
or
a
statutory
administrative
scheme
involving
deference
to
another
branch
of
government,
and
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i'm
not
quite
sure
i--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--justice
breyer--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--justice
breyer,
my
clients--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
the
typical
dissident
in
the
case
where
i
have
represented
clients,
and
i've
represented
dissidents
in
many
places,
including
the
lehnert
case
which
this
court
decided.
the
typical
dissident
wants
to
obtain
a
judicial
determination
of
his
constitutional,
in
this
case
also
rights
under
the
statute,
in
which
he
has
an
opportunity
for
discovery,
which
is
denied
in
this
arbitration
process,
in
which
he
has
a
determination
by
an
article
iii
judge
qualified
to
determine
what
speech
and
association
he
can
be
compelled
to
support,
he
wants
a
truly
adversary
hearing
where
he
has
discovery
in
which
he
can
vet
the
potential
evidence
in
advance
of
the
hearing,
as
the
sixth
circuit
held
in
the
bromley
case.
that's
crucial
to
these
cases.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
your
honor,
but
i
can
answer
one
question,
and
that
is,
if
you
look
at
the
law
review
article
by
mr.
malin,
who
was...
one
of
his
articles
was
cited
by
alpa
in
one
of
its
amici.
i
cite
another
one
on
the
post
gilmer
arbitration,
and
mr.
malin
points
out
in
that
article
that
the
arbitrators
have
to
receive
recommendations
from
four
employers
and
four
unions
to
get
on
the
panel
to
be
selected
in
these
cases.
my
clients
have
no
say
over
whether
it's
aaa
or
somebody
else
who
picks
the
arbitrator
and
they
have
no
say
in
the
selection
of
the
so-called
arbitrator.
the
essence
of
arbitration--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--clients,
nonmembers
who
are
lucky
enough
to
have
an
attorney
represent
them
are
going
to
say
no
thanks
to
this
particular
arbitration
procedure,
or
this
particular
decisionmaking
process.
hudson...
put
hudson
in
context.
hudson
was
a
case,
a
public
sector
case
decided
under
section
1983
where
this
court
had
already
decided
that
you
could
not
be
required
to
exhaust
even
a
state
administrative
remedy,
and
hudson
imposed...
after
all,
in
hudson
it
was
the
state
who
was
ultimately
compelling
the
employees
to
pay
the
agency
fee.
it
was
under
a
state
statute,
and
an
agreement
with
a
public
employer.
hudson
placed
the
primary
burden
on
the
state
to
establish
this
alternative
procedure,
and
that
was
only
4
years
after
this
court's
decision
in
patsy
saying
that
you
can't
be
required
to
exhaust
a
state
administrative
remedy,
and
so
therefore
i
find
it
inconceivable
to
think
that
the
court
in
hudson
could
have
been
supposing
that
the
nonmembers
could
have
been
compelled
to
utilize
this
procedure.
this
procedure
is
made
available--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--they
conceived
of
it,
that's
correct.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
[laughter]
but
i...
but
the
majority
did
not
agree
with
them,
because
the
majority
did
not
adopt--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--well,
i
think
the
majority
suggested
the
contrary
at
several
points
in
its
decision.
in
footnote
20
the
court
presumed
that
ordinary
judicial
remedies
remain
available.
in
footnote
16
in
hudson
the
court
said
that
the
nonmember's
burden
is
simply
the
obligation
to
make
his
objection
known,
citing
the
earlier--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens,
and
what
the
court
was
doing
there,
as
the
chief
justice
has
suggested,
was
providing
a
shield
for
the
protection
of
employee
rights,
not
giving
the
union
a
sword
to
take
another
right
away
from
the
employee,
which
is
the
right
of
immediate
access
to
the
federal
courts
guaranteed
to
them
by
article
iii
of
the
constitution
and
the
right
to
redress
of
grievances
under
first
amendment--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
that
would
be...
it
would
be
exhaustion
by
using
another
term.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
article
iii
says
that
where
congress
has
granted
jurisdiction
to
the
courts
the
litigation
has
a
right
to
bring
his
case
into
court.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
was
referring,
your
honor,
to
what
this
court
said--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--article
iii
places
the
determination
of
federal
causes
of
action
in
article
iii
judges,
and
this
court
has
held
that
that
means
that
a
litigant
has
a
right
to
have
his
federal
cause
of
action
determined
by
an
article
iii
judge,
and
those--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
grande
financial
s.a.
v.
nordberg,
492
u.s.
33,
which
we
quote
on
page
23
of
our
brief,
the
court
says,
if
a
statutory
right
is
not
closely
intertwined
with
a
federal
regulatory
program...
in
other
words,
the
administrative
scheme,
which
we
don't
have
here...
congress
has
power
to
enact,
and
if
that
right
neither
belongs
to
nor
exists
against
the
federal
government,
then
it
must
be
adjudicated
by
an
article
iii
court,
end
quote.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
certainly,
your
honor--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--and
the
central
theme
of
the
case--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
stevens.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
but
as
this
court
said
in
both
patsy
and
later
in
felder
v.
casey
the
court
does
not
have
discretion
to
simply
require
exhaustion
out
of
questions
of
practicality
or
judicial
efficiency.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it
has
to
be
consistent
with
congressional
intent.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
with
that,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
justice
breyer,
your
example
points
out
the
need
for
both
systems.
that
is,
the
impartial
decisionmaker
required
by
hudson
as
a
matter
of
first
amendment
due
process
and
the
ability
of
the
individual
who
has
an
attorney
and
really
wants
a
judicial
determination
to
go
to
court
first.
that
individual
is
only
going
to
be
delayed
by
the
exhaustion
requirement,
but
you
have
to
have
the
impartial
decisionmaker,
a
simpler,
less
formal
procedure
available
for
the
nonmember
who
can't
afford
to
hire
an
attorney,
and...
plus--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--give
him
due
process.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it's
an
argument
that
doesn't
hold
water,
your
honor,
because
in
any
event
there
are
going
to
be
conflicting
decisions
from
different
courts,
different
arbitrations.
this
union
has
employees,
airline
pilots
throughout
the
entire
nation.
some
may
bring
a
case
in
one
federal
district
court,
others
in
another.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
yes,
it
could,
your
honor.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
but
in
either
event
you're
going
to
have
a
decision
by
an
arbitrator
and
then
a
decision
by
the
court,
whether
it's
sequential
or--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at...
you
have
to
look
at
the
cause
of
action
involved
here.
in
the
public
sector
it's
a
cause
of
action
under
42
u.s.c.
section
1983,
and
this
court
held
in
patsy
and
later
in
felder
that
based
on
legislative
history
that
the
congressional
intent
was
that
these
statutes
for
the
paramount
protection
of
individual
rights
were
intended
by
congress
to
be
in
the
courts
in
the
first
instance.
because
the
parallel
situation
under
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
which
is
the
basis
of
the
cause
of
action
here.
the
duty
of
fair
representation
was
adopted
by
this
court
in
1944
in
steel
to
protect
individual
employees
from
unions
abusing
their
power
of
exclusive
representation.
in
fact,
it
was
adopted
by
the
court
to
avoid
having
to
declare
the
statute
unconstitutional.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
two
questions,
your
honor.
one,
in
steel
the
court
said,
we
have
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
impose
the
duty
of
fair
representation
on
unions,
because
if
we
don't
make
that
assumption
the
statute
is
probably
unconstitutional.
the
court
then
said,
there's
no
remedy
provided
under
the
railway
labor
act,
which
is
the
statute
in
this
case,
for
vindication
of
an
employee's
rights
where
he's
accusing
the
union
of
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
later,
in
vaca
and
breininger
the
court
held
that
employees
have
the
right
to
take
that
cause
of
action
for
breach
of
duty
of
fair
representation
directly
to
the
federal
courts
because
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
paramount
purpose
of
the
statute
is
the
protection
of
individual
rights,
just
as
it
is
under
section
1983,
that
the
nonmember...
that
the
employee
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
doesn't
have
to
go
before
the
national
labor
relations
board
first.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
yes,
it
is
clear.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
it's
clear
in
this
case
for
two
reasons,
justice
scalia,
first
because
this
court
held
in
hanson
in
1956
that
the
railway
labor
act
authorization
of
agency
shop
agreements
is
governmental
action,
federal
governmental
action,
and
so
constitutional
limitations
do
apply,
and--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--you're
making
one
of
the
points
that
i
wanted
to
make,
your
honor,
is
that
alpa's
in
the
wrong
place.
it
is
asking
this
court
to
construct
a
remedy
scheme
that
congress
has
not
constructed.
it
should
be
addressing
the
practical
concerns
that
it's
raising
to
congress,
not
to
this
court--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--which
doesn't
have
the
discretion
to
impose
exhaustion
simply
as
a
matter
of
practicalities
unless
it
is
consistent
with
congressional
intent,
and
there
are
two
aspects
in
which
this
requirement
is
inconsistent
with
congressional
intent.
one
is
the
point
i
was
making
with
regard
to
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
that
is,
that
this
court
has
already
held
that
congress
intended
that
these
cases
be
considered
in
the
courts
in
the
first
instance,
because
the
paramount
purpose
of
the
duty
is
to
protect
individual
rights.
and
the
second
is
that
beginning
with
hanson
this
court
has
said
that
the
only
incident
of
union
membership
that
can
be
imposed
on
the
nonmember
is
the
payment
of
the
cost
of
collective
bargaining,
and
here
you're
imposing
on
the
nonmember
an
additional
incident
of
union
membership,
exhaustion
of
a
union
remedy.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
this
court
held
both
in
the
railway
labor
act
cases
back
in
the
sixties,
street
and
allen,
and
later
in
abood,
that
the
nonmember
need
only
state
a
general
objection
and
then
the
union
is
put
to
its
burden
of
proof,
and
in
allen--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--that--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--how
is
the
nonmember
to
have
reason?
the
nonmember
doesn't
have
the
facts.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
they're
solely
in
the
possession
of
the
union.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
i
return
your
honor
to
the
principle
that
this
court
has
followed
consistently,
which
is
that
you
cannot
just
as
a
matter
of
judicial
discretion
require
exhaustion
unless--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--your
honor,
he
doesn't
have
the
facts,
because
the
notice
that
the...
hudson
requires--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
you,
justice
stevens.
you're
saying
the
employee
merely
states
an
objection,
the
union
holds
its
arbitration
ex
parte,
and
then
the
employee
can
go
to
court.
i
don't
see
the
purpose
of
that.
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
but
they've
agreed
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure.
the
union
is
their
agent
for
purposes
of
their--
mr.
raymond
j.
lajeunesse,
jr.
--relationship
with
their
employer.
it
is
not
their
agent
for
purposes
of
their
dispute
with
itself,
and
those
cases,
justice
breyer,
also
are
cases
in
which...
they're
simple
contract
grievance
arbitration
cases
in
which
both
parties
know
most
of
the
underlying
facts.
here
we're
talking
about
68
million
in
union
expenditures.
the
pilot
doesn't
have
a
basis
to

all
he's
required

do
by

is
state
a
general
objection
to
the
use

money
for

other
than
collective

then
he's
entitled
to
discovery
in

to
find
out
what
underlies
the

calculations,
and
the
union
has
the
burden
of
proving
its

was
denied
to
the

they
were
not
given
the
opportunity...
they
could
not
compel
the
testimony
of

witnesses.
without
discovery,
they
couldn't
effectively
cross-examine.
they
couldn't
narrow
the
issues,
because
they
didn't
know
the

facts.
and
in

i
would
say
that
the
court

correctly

not

proceed

mr.

justice
ginsburg,
it's
a
truly
extraordinary
statutory
privilege
that
the
unions
have
to
compel
nonmembers

pay
these
dues,
and
this
court
held
in

means
it's
also
a
matter

to
make
available
a
procedure
which
is
a
shield
to
protect
