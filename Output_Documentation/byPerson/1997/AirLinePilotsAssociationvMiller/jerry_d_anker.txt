mr.
jerry
d.
anker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
section
211
of
the
railway
labor
act
permits
unions
and
employers
to
enter
into
what
are
you
called
agency,
shop,
or
similar
forms
of
union
security
agreements.
under
an
agency
shop
agreement,
represented
employees
are
not
required
to
become
union
members,
but
they
are
required
to
support
the
union
financially
through
the
payment
of
the
equivalent
of
union
dues,
initiation
fees,
and
assessments.
however,
in
a
line
of
cases
stretching
back
now
more
than
35
years,
this
court
has
said
that
a
union
may
not
use
such
an
agreement
to
require
objecting
nonmembers
to
pay
for
union
activities
that
are
political
and
ideological
in
nature
or
are
otherwise
unrelated
to
the
collective
bargaining
function.
in
1986,
in
chicago
teacher's
union
v.
hudson,
the
court
went
one
step
further
and
held
that
unions
must
provide
three
procedural
safeguards
to
ensure
that
objectors'
funds
will
not
be
spent
improperly,
and
those
safeguards
are,
first
a
notice
containing
an
adequate
explanation
of
how
the
fee
is
calculated,
second,
a
reasonably
prompt
opportunity
to
challenge
the
fee
before
an
impartial
decisionmaker,
and
third,
an
escrow
for
the
amounts
reasonably
in
dispute
while
those
challenges
are
pending.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
employees
who
wish
to
challenge
the
fee
that
they're
being
charged
must
present
their
claim
to
that
impartial
decisionmaker
before
bringing
any
kind
of
a
lawsuit.
this
case
arose
in
november
of
1991,
when
the
airline
pilots
association,
or
alpa,
as
we
called
it,
entered
into
an
agency
shop
agreement
with
delta
airlines,
very
much
like
the
agency
shop
agreements
alpa
has
with
most
of
the
country's
airlines.
before
the
agreement
even
became
effective,
five
delta
pilots,
later
joined
by
about
150
intervenors,
filed
a
lawsuit
to
enjoin
implementation
of
that
agreement.
they
had
many
grounds
for
their
lawsuit,
but
for
present
purposes
the
only
one
that's
relevant
here
was
the
allegation
that
alpa
does
not,
or
does
charge
objectors
improperly
for
activities
which
are
outside
the
scope
of
collective
bargaining.
now,
alpa
has
written
procedures
in
compliance
with
the
hudson
decision
that
include
an
impartial
decisionmaker
for
the
purpose
of
resolving
such
disputes.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
yes.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
you're
talking
about
specifically--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--in
our
case?
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
all
right.
i
think,
your
honor,
the
procedures
vary
from
union
to
union.
the
way
it
works
in
alpa
is
the
following
way.
the
books
are
closed...
we're
on
an
annual
year
basis,
so
that
the
books
are
closed
at
the
end
of
each
year
and
then
there
is
a
general
audit
of
the
books,
and
in
connection
with
that
audit,
or
once
that
audit
is
completed,
then
a
statement
is
prepared
and
that
statement
itself
is
also
audited,
setting
forth
the
germane
and
nongermane
expenses,
the
major
categories,
which
is
essentially
our
hudson
notice.
at
that
point,
any--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
that's--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--let
me...
if
i
can
just
finish,
i
think
i'll...
you'll
see
that
part
of
it.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
the
statement
is
issued.
at
that
point,
for
the
year
in
which
it's
issued,
there
is
an
immediate
but
only
provisional
adjustment
put
into
place.
then
when
that
year
is
finished
there
is
a
final
calculation
and
we
actually
either
add
charges
or
refund,
depending
on
what
the
differences
are.
it's
at
that
point
that
the
pilot
has
the
right
to
challenge
that
calculation.
now,
when
he
does
that,
of
course,
he's
challenging
both
the
retrospective
one
and
also
the
provisional
one
for
the
coming
year,
but
that's
the
way
our
system
works.
other
unions
have
a
different
system.
other
unions
are
always
running
1
year
behind,
and
they
don't
go
back
and
make
the
retroactive
adjustment,
which
we
do.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
no,
your
honor,
not
to
my
knowledge,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--well,
it's...
it
may--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--all
right.
i
think
that's
the
core
of
this
case,
and
i
think
to
call
it
arbitration,
which
in
a
sense
it
is,
is
also
in
another
sense
misleading,
because
it
is
really
not
consensual
arbitration,
which
is
what
most
arbitration
is,
although
i
gather
there
are
statutes...
one
of
the
article
iii
cases
cited
by
counsel
involves
the
fifra
statute,
which
has
a
compulsory
arbitration.
i
think
erisa
has
a
compulsory
arbitration
that's
not
consensual.
but
in
any
event--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--that's
correct.
this
is
a--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--this
is
a
special
procedure.
we
call
it
arbitration
because
it
most
resembles
arbitration,
but
what
the
court
called
it
in
hudson
was
an
impartial
decisionmaker,
and
i
think
the
vision
that
the
court
had
is
that
these
disputes
should
be
decided
by
some
form
of
private
process,
arbitration-like
process,
or
at
least
they
should
be
submitted
to
such
a
process
before
they
go
to
court.
that--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--how
are
they
picked?
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
all
right--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--in
our
case,
and
i
think
here
we
follow
the
pattern
that
most
unions
have
adopted,
we
use
a
procedure
which
the
american
arbitration
association
created.
in
the
wake
of
hudson
the
american
arbitration
association
created
a
procedure
specifically
for
this
purpose
called
the
arbitration
rules
for
the
impartial
determination
of
union
fees,
and
under
those
rules
the
union
may
request
an
arbitrator
and
invoke
those
procedures
and
then
the
aaa,
from
a
panel
that
they
have
selected,
designates
an
arbitrator.
he's
not
selected
by
either
of
the
disputing
parties.
he's
designated
by
the
american
arbitration--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--that's
correct.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
no.
neither
party
has.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
neither
party
does,
although
there
are,
of
course,
provisions
for
challenging
an
arbitrator
for
cause
if
there's
some
ground
to
believe
that
he
is
biased
in
some
way,
or
has
some
interest--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--surely.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
in
the
year
that
this
case
arose,
which
was
1992,
the
fees
were
2.35
percent
of
their
airline
earnings.
they've
since
been
reduced
to
about
1.95,
but
in
that
year
it
was
2.35.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
it's
based...
it's
a
percentage
of
his
earnings,
right.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
2,350.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
that's
about
right.
that's
about
right,
just...
for
example,
in
this
case
the
arbitrator
found
that
there
were
some
items
that
had
been
improperly
allocated
and
should
not
have
been
charged,
and
we
rebated
those,
and
it
came
to,
i
think,
of
the
order...
this
is
not
in
the
record,
but
it's
of
the
order
of
55
on
average
for
the
individuals
that
were
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--i
guess
i
would
answer
it
this
way,
your
honor.
we
are
dealing
here...
all
the
statute
says,
as
i
indicated
at
the
beginning,
is
that
the
union
and
the
employer
has
a
right
to
have
this
kind
of
an
agreement,
but
the
court
has
found
beneath
the
language
of
the
statute
and
sort
of
in
the
underlying
legislative
history
and
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
an
intent
by
congress
that
fees
be
used
only
for
certain
purposes
and
not
for
others,
and
based
on
the
determination
that
there
is
such
an
intention,
that
that's
what
congress
wanted,
there
is
a
body
of
law
which
has
had
to
be
necessarily
developed
by
this
court.
it's
not
that
different
from
the
body
of
law
that
has
been
developed
surrounding
the
duty
of
fair
representation,
or
surrounding
collective
bargaining
agreements
under
section
301
of
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
it's
judicially
made
law.
now,
in
hudson--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--well,
my
answer
would
be,
your
honor,
that
that's
exactly
what
the
court
did
in
the
hudson
case.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
the
court
said
that
the
union
must
provide
this
procedure.
it's
not
an
option.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
certainly
in
hudson
there
were
constitutional
provisions,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it
was
the
due
process
clause.
i
think
it
was
the
first
amendment.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
right,
which
is
not,
of
course,
a
procedural
provision
of
the
constitution.
it's
a
substantive
provision.
but
the
court
decided
that
in
order
to
protect
the
substantive
right
which
the...
in
that
case
the
challengers
had
under
the
first
amendment--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--there
had
to
be
these
procedures.
now--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--no,
there's
not
a
constitutional
compulsion,
but
there
is...
the
same
kind
of
a
right
which
exists
in
the
public
sector
under
the
first
amendment
exists
under
the...
in
the
private
sector
under
the
statute,
based
upon--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--all
right--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--but
the
union
has
rights
here
too,
your
honor,
and
those
are
the
rights
after
all,
to
collect
these
fees
and
to
have
a
functioning
agency
shop
agreement
and
to
have
it
work
without
excessive
burdens
that
make
it
impractical.
in
the
hudson
opinion
the
court
said...
i'm
not
sure
if
i
can
quote
it
exactly,
but
the
court
said
that
the
object
should
be
to
ensure...
define
procedures
which
will
en...
protect
the
dissidents
against
having
to
subsidize
ideological
activities
without
impairing
the
right
of
the
union
to
have
this
agency
shop
and
to
obtain
these
funds
in
timely
fashion
and
to
use
them
in
a
way
that
they're
permitted
to
use
them.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
there's
a
balance.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
correct,
impartial
decisionmaker.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
suppose
in
practice
it
does.
the
way
we've
resolved
that,
your
honor,
is
to
say
that
we
will
pay
for
the
arbitration
unless
any
of
the
dissidents
wants
to
share
the
cost
for
some
reason
and
then
they're
certainly
welcome
to
do
that.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
they
might
want
to--
[laughter]
we
always
thought
they
might
want
to
do
it
to
be
more
comfortable
about
the
impartiality
of
the--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--in
practice,
we
do.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
i
have
to
say,
your
honor,
that
my
knowledge
about
that
is
fairly
limited,
but
i
think
the
union
that
has
the
most
experience
with
it
is
the
national
education
association,
which
has
filed
a
brief
as
an
amicus
here,
and
they
have
informed
the
court
in
their
brief
that
in...
i
don't
remember
whether
they
said
in
most,
but
in
some
large
percentage
of
their
cases
their...
they
do
not
go
beyond
the
arbitration.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
now,
i
have
no
personal
knowledge
of
that
and
i
really
can't
take--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--we
would
not
have
that
degree
of
finality
to
the
arbitration,
no,
your
honor.
there
was
an
issue
in
the
lower
court
here
as
to
just
what
degree,
if
any,
of
deference
is
to
be
given,
and
the
district
took
the
view
which
we
had
urged
upon
it
that
the
findings
of
fact
of
the
arbitrator
should
be
given
deference
under
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
but
not
the
conclusion
of
law.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
my
recollection
is
that
the
only
one
that
has
anything
to
say
about
it
was
the
national
education
association.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
it's
a
little
more
money,
your
honor,
but
in
every
case
the
amount
of
money
tends
to
be
relatively
small,
certainly
in
relation
to
the
income
of
the
fee-payer.
i
think
very
often
these
are
thought
to
be
great
issues
of
principle
by
the--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--yes,
i
think
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
yes.
either
a
percentage
or
sometimes
a
number
of
hours
of
pay.
i
can't
tell
you
how
many
unions
have
that,
but
i
think
it's
quite
a
common--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--if
the
suit
goes
to
the
federal
court--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--i
suppose
there
is
provision
for
attorney's
fees,
under
1983.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
19...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
what
you're...
if
you're
asking,
is
this
case
under
1983,
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
no,
it
would
not,
your
honor,
not
in
the...
well,
not
in
the
case
of
a
private
sector,
because
we
are
not
a
governmental
entity.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
we
cannot
be
sued
under
1983.
we...
the
labor
organization.
in
the--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--in
the
public
sector
the
cases
are
brought
under
1983,
perhaps
because
they're
usually
brought
against
the
state
employer
as
well.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
federal
question
jurisdiction.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
that's
right,
your
honor,
because
the
obligation
here
is
derived
from
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
it's
general
federal
question
jurisdiction.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
yes.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
on
the--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--correct.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
appreciate
that,
your
honor.
let
me
say
first
of
all
that
we
have
never
argued
in
this
case
that
that
standard,
which
essentially
is
a
standard
of
finality
and
almost
no
review
at
all
in
the
case
of
normal
arbitration...
we
have
never
argued
that
that
standard
would
apply.
the
argument
we
make
in
this
case...
and
by
the
way,
this
issue
is
not
before
the
court,
because
the
court
did
not
grant
certiorari
with
respect
to
this
issue
of
the
standard
of
review,
but
what
we
argued
in
the
lower
courts
was
that
the
fact-findings
of
the
arbitrator
should
be
given
some
degree
of
deference,
and
those
fact-findings
would
normally
be
the
bean-counting
issues,
as
i
would
describe
them,
exactly
how
much
did
the
union
spend
on
this
or
that
or
the
other
activity.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
think
i
would
rely
on
the
advocacy
of
my
adversary
to
make
that
clear,
and
i
would
not--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--well,
i
would
just
suggest,
your
honor,
that
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
this
body
of
law,
because
this
is
statutory
law,
and
the
court
has
some
jurisdiction,
we
don't
deny
that,
ultimately
to
adjudicate
the
rights
of
the
parties
here,
but...
and
just
to
finish
the
standard
of
review
as
we
had
proposed
it
to
the
lower
courts,
we
would
say
that
the
legal
issues,
which
really
i
think
are
the
key
issues
here,
is,
for
example,
in
our
case
the
issue
of
the
chargeability
of
our
safety
activity.
that's
an
issue
of
law
basically,
and
that
would
be
reviewable
de
novo,
but
the
court
would
have
a
package
in
which
the
facts
would
be
at
least
preliminarily
resolved,
the
issues
would
be
defined,
and
the
court
in
quite
expeditious
fashion
but
in
effective
fashion
could
exercise
its
jurisdiction
and
define
the
rights
of
the
parties
properly
here.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
yes.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
that's
unavoidable,
but
i...
my
only
response
to
that
would
be
i
don't
think
it's
any
greater
an
act
of
judicial
legislation
to
impose
on
the
challenger
the
requirement
of
exhaustion
than
it
is
to
impose
on
the
union
the
obligation
to
provide
this
procedure
in
the
first
place.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
in
that
case,
yes,
right.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
no,
not
constitutional
rights,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
they
are
rights,
nonetheless.
we
have
statutory
rights
that
are
at
stake
here,
and
the
court
has
created
a
procedure
which,
if
exhaustion
is
not
required,
essentially
doubles
the
burden
on
the
union,
because
we
have
to
defend
these
cases
if
they're
brought
against
us
both
in
arbitration
and
in
federal
court,
which
is
essentially
what
happened
here.
this
group
of
plaintiffs
who
are
before
this
court
now
preferred
the
judicial
forum,
and
they
brought
a
lawsuit,
and
they
resisted
arbitration,
and
if
they
had
had
their
choice
they
would
have
avoided
the
arbitration,
but
we
had
another
group
of
people
who
are
not
before
the
court
at
all
who
requested
arbitration,
and
we
had
to
go
forward
with
an
arbitration
regardless
of
what
the
desires
were
here,
and
that's
going
to
happen
in
very
many
cases.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
oh,
i...
no,
your
honor,
it
isn't,
but
the
court
has
set
up--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--instead
of
arbitration?
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
much
better
than
the
situation
with
having
to
deal
with
both
of
them,
that's
correct.
i
don't
know
if
we
had
our
choice
what
we
would
choose,
but
we
would
certainly
prefer
to
have
one
forum
rather
than
two,
and
if
there
is
no
exhaustion
requirement,
then
we
would
much
prefer
to
have
a
federal
court
procedure
than
have
them
both.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
there
was
such
a
request
in
this
case.
it
was
denied
by
the
federal
court.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
i
don't
know
of
any
other
case,
your
honor.
if
i
could,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
i
have
three
quick
points
i
would
like
to
make.
first
of
all,
there's
been
a
lot
of
discussion
by
mr.
lejeunesse
about
the
intent
of
the
statute,
and
i
think
it's
clear
to
say
that
the
statute
simply
sheds
no
light
whatsoever
on
the
question
that's
before
us,
and
that's
not
unusual.
very
often
these
exhaustion
questions
are
not
resolved
by
any
statute,
and
certainly
this
one
doesn't
have
anything
whatsoever
to
say
on
the
subject.
now,
when
the
statute
is
silent,
what
this
court
has
said...
and
i
think
this
is
really
the
ultimate
answer
to
the
questions
that
were
asked
of
me
earlier
by
justice
ginsburg
and
others,
where
does
the
authority
come
from
to
require
this
exhaustion,
this
court
has
said
on
several
different
occasions
that
exhaustion
of
an
administrative
remedy
or
an
arbitration
remedy,
as
in
hudson,
as
in
republic
steel
v.
maddox
is
a
matter
of
judicial
discretion.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
your
honor,
one
could
say
that
on
the
facts
of
republic
steel,
but
the
interesting
thing
about
the
case
is,
when
you
read
it,
that
was
not
the
principal
reliance
of
the
court
at
all.
the
court
spoke
about
several
different
policy
considerations.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
i
agree
it
doesn't
bind
him,
your
honor--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--it's
maybe
just
simply
a
semantic
issue
between
us,
but
it's
a
remedy
in
the
sense
that
it's
a
way
in
which
he
might
get
what
he's
looking
for.
he
might
get
the
adjudication
of
the
issue
in
his
favor,
and
that
would
resolve
the
problem
for
him,
or
her,
and
that's
why
i
would
consider
it
a
remedy.
but
if
the
court
doesn't
like
that
word,
i
think
it's
still
analogous
to
a
remedy
in
a
typical
exhaustion
case
such
that
the
normal
judicial
discretion
would
apply.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
well,
any
kind
of
an
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
they
are
governmental
remedies,
but
they're
nonjudicial
remedies,
and
even
where
the
statute
doesn't
require--
mr.
jerry
d.
anker
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
you're
making
two
points.
let
me
take
the
first
one
first.
one
of
the
reasons
is
the
reason
relating
to
the
governmental
decisionmaker,
but
the
cases
have
stated
several
reasons.
other
reasons
are
efficiency,
reasons
of
avoiding
controversy
in
court
if
it's
possible
to
do
so.
it
isn't...
that
isn't
the
only
reason
for
exhaustion
of
administrative
remedies.
now,
i'm
not
sure
i
can
come
up
immediately
with
another
example,
other
than
maddox,
of
an
exhaustion
of
a
private
remedy,
but
maddox
is
certainly
a
case
of
one,
and
it's
one
in
which...
actually
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
the
individual
never
consented.
the
consent
is
only
kind
of
a
constructive
consent,
because
of
the
fact
that
he
is
represented
by
the
union.
