unknown
speaker
mr.
anker--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
mind
telling
me
as
a
practical
matter
how
these
fee
challenges
typically
come
up?
are
they
usually
brought
to
challenge
the
amount
of
past
payments,
or
are
they
typically
prospective
in
nature?
how
does
the
union
notify
people--
unknown
speaker
--of
the
breakdown?
unknown
speaker
yes.
well,
the
typical
situation.
unknown
speaker
usually
there's
been
some
prospective
estimates.
unknown
speaker
so
that
they're
not
charged
the
full
amount.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you...
it
doesn't
get
serious
until
after
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
unknown
speaker
have...
has
this
court
ever
required
a
nonsignatory
to
a
contract
to
submit
to
arbitration
rather
than
going
to
court?
unknown
speaker
it's
kind
of
a
big
step
to
do.
i
mean,
it
may--
unknown
speaker
--help
as
a
practical
matter,
but
i
just...
i
wondered
what
kind
of
authority
there
would
be
for
that.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
it
is
compulsory
for
the
union
here.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
we've
done
that
half-way--
unknown
speaker
--is
this,
mr.
anker,
strictly
speaking,
an
impartial
decisionmaker?
how
are
the
people
picked?
unknown
speaker
how
at
the
people
picked
for
the
tribunal
or
the--
unknown
speaker
--person
who
would
make
this
decision?
unknown
speaker
from
a
panel
that
the
aaa
has
selected?
unknown
speaker
and
do
the
dissidents
have
any
part
in
selecting
that?
unknown
speaker
neither
party?
unknown
speaker
mr.
anker,
can
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question--
unknown
speaker
--i
just
get
out
of
the
papers?
what
are
the
annual
dues
of
the
pilots
here?
how
much
money
are
we
talking
about
if
you
change
it
from
15
percent
to
20
percent?
unknown
speaker
so
for
each
member
of
the
union
it's
a
different
dollar
figure.
unknown
speaker
and
if
they
made,
say,
100,000
a
year
they
would
get
a...
the
dues
would
be--
unknown
speaker
--i
see,
so
that
a...
and
then
if
you
reduce
that,
say
10
percent
was
in
dispute,
it
would
be
a
couple
of
hundred
dollars
in
dispute
for
each
person.
unknown
speaker
justice
o'connor's
question
was,
what
is
the
source
of
our
authority
to
do
this?
i
mean,
if
we
think
this
is
a
good
idea
for
national
labor
policy,
does
that
give
us
the
authority
to
require
people
who
have
never
consented
to
the
arbitration
to
arbitrate?
unknown
speaker
where
do
i
have
the
power,
does
this
court
have
the
power
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think--
unknown
speaker
--but
there's
almost
a
history
or
tradition
that
congress
sets
up
remedial
schemes.
we
don't
set
up
remedial
structures.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
that
was
under
the
due
process
clause,
wasn't
it?
you
know,
you
go
back
to
the
hanson
case,
where
the
court
says,
well
now,
the
government
has
its
hand
on
the
scale
here
so
there's
some
constitutional
provisions
involved.
unknown
speaker
well,
first
amendment.
unknown
speaker
there
had
to
be--
unknown
speaker
--but
now,
to
me
it
seems
there
is
a
difference
here
suggested
by
justice
kennedy,
perhaps,
that
there
isn't
any
similar
constitutional
compulsion
to
set
up
the
procedure
you
want
to.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
could
be
invoked
by
the
dissidents--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
think
not
by
the
union.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask
one
other
detail,
if
i
may?
this
opinion
said
in
substance
the
union
had
a
duty
to
provide
this
impartial...
we
didn't
use
the
word
arbitrator,
as
i
remember,
just
impartial
person--
unknown
speaker
--to
look
at
what
was
done.
but
does
that
mean
the
union
has
to
pay
for
the
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
they
ever
want
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see
what
you're
saying.
but
in
practice
you
do
pay
the
arbitrator.
unknown
speaker
mr.
anker,
if
i
look
at
hudson
and
don't
go
any
further
than
that,
i
at
least
find
it
difficult
to
conclude
that
the
provision
for
the
neutral
decisionmaker
was
intended
to
be
anything
but
a
protection
for
the
dissidents.
it
was
their
interests
that
were
getting
litigated
there,
and
the
court
mentioned
the
value
of
a
speedy
determination.
all
of
that
seems
to
take
into
consideration
the
interests
of
the
dissidents.
however,
my
question
to
you
is
going
to
be,
should
we
consider
other
interests
in
going
beyond
hudson?
should
we
consider,
for
example,
the
impracticality,
if
that
is
true,
of
litigating
every
one
of
these
issues
first
and
last
in
the
federal
courts?
with
that
in
mind,
i
would
like
to
know
what
the
experience
has
been,
if
you
can
tell
me,
about
what
has
happened
after
there
has
been
arbitration.
have
all
of
the
arbitrated
cases
then
simply
been
litigated
de
novo,
all
over
again
in
the
federal
courts,
which
i
doubt,
but
perhaps
that
happened.
is
there
a
pattern
that
emerges
about
the
relationship
between
the
arbitration
that
has
taken
place
in
the
instances
that
you
know
of
and
what
later
happens
in
federal
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
what--
unknown
speaker
--you
wouldn't,
i
take
it...
under
the
system
you're
proposing
you
wouldn't
have
the
sort
of
deference
to
an
arbitrator's
finding
that
results
when
consensual
arbitration
has
been
in
place,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
do
any
of
the
other
briefs
expand
on
the
question
that
justice
souter
asked
you?
what
happens
to
these
things
after
the
neutral
decisionmaker
reaches
a
judgment?
unknown
speaker
and
of
course,
there,
at
least
as
i
remember
the
case,
the
dues
are
a
lot
lower,
so
the
amount
in
dispute
sometimes
was
just
pennies
on
these
small
amounts,
and
it
might
be
that
it's
just
not
worth
litigating,
whereas
here
it
seems
to
be
a
little
more
money
at
stake.
unknown
speaker
is
it
typical
for
union
dues
to
be
calculated
as
a
percentage
of
the
income
of
the
union
member?
unknown
speaker
it
is
typical?
unknown
speaker
when
the
suit
is
brought,
is
it
brought
under
1983,
or
another
statute
that
gives
the
prevailing
party
attorney's
fees,
if
the
suit
goes
to
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
because...
is
it
1983?
unknown
speaker
but
the
union
members...
i
mean,
the
nonunion
members'
case
in
court
would
be
under
1983.
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
then--
unknown
speaker
--what's
the
basis
of
any
sort
of
federal--
unknown
speaker
--there
will
be
federal
question
jurisdiction
in
a
case
of
a
private
employer?
unknown
speaker
but
no
attorney's...
no
attorney's
fees
under
the
general
federal
question
jurisdiction,
then?
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
provide
for
attorney's
fees
for
the
prevailing
party.
unknown
speaker
can
you...
you
might
want
to
elaborate
a
little
bit--
unknown
speaker
--if
you'd
like
on
the
question
the
chief
justice
asked.
seeing
this
as--
unknown
speaker
--because
it
seemed
to
me
that
the
real
objection
on
the
other
side,
what
they're
upset
about
in
part
is
that
they
see
the
union
has
a
right
to
the
2,000,
but
it
doesn't
have
a
right
to
the
part
of
the
2,000
that
might
go
to
nongermane
expenditure,
and
then
we
decide,
and
this
court
decides
in
hudson
that
really
the
union
can
go
and
spend
what
it
wants
as
long
as
it
gives
them,
a
dissenter
a
fair
chance
to
see
how
much
of
that
is
being
spent
on
nongermane
things,
and
it
says
you
have
to
have
an
escrow.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
give
them
a
list
of
what
the
expenditures
were,
and
you
have
to
provide
for
a
decision
by
an
independent
decisionmaker.
having
done
that,
you're
free.
go
do
what
you
want.
all
right.
but
then
they
say,
well,
how
do
we
challenge
it,
and
i
think
what
they're
worried
about
is
that
there
will
be
imported
into
this
area
of
the
law
the
whole
law
of
arbitration
which,
of
course,
gives
a
tremendous
leg
up
to
whatever
the
decision
of
the
arbitrator
is.
i
mean,
a
leg
up
way
beyond
what
a
master
or
others
have,
and
i
think
that
was
a
concern,
and
therefore
i
want
to
be
sure
that
you
address
that
point.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
your
theory
that
the
procedure
has
to
be
expeditious
and
efficient,
what
would
prevent
a
court
from
saying
that
the
usual
rules
of
presumptive
correctness
should
not
be
applied?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i
mean,
we're
testing
your
theory.
under
your
theory
we
can
do
whatever
is
efficient,
and
if
we
think
that
a
binding
arbitration
is
the
most
efficient,
then
we
can
do
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
anker--
unknown
speaker
--everything
that
you've
said
sounds
logical,
sensible,
a
regime
that
might
be
legislated.
the
problem
in
this
case
is,
you
start
with
a
court
decision,
not
something
from
congress
but
something
from
this
court,
the
hudson,
and
then
you
say,
well,
the
workers
were
benefited
by
hudson
but
the
court
now
has
to
rule-make
a
little
more
so
that
it's
even
on
both
sides.
if
the
employer...
if
the
union
is
stuck
with
this
procedure,
the
union
doesn't
want
to
arbitrate
either,
let's
say,
but
the
court
forced
it
on
the
union,
then
the
court
must...
and
it's
all
the
court
doing
this
with...
as
kind
of
ontoward
from
anything
that
congress
has
done.
unknown
speaker
but
with
the
union,
mr.
anker,
there
was
a
constitutional
problem.
unknown
speaker
yes,
and
there
isn't
here.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that's
one
significant
distinction.
in
other
words,
the
court
said
there
had
to
be
an
impartial
reviewer
of
these
allotments
in
order
to
protect
the
dissidents'
first
amendment
rights,
but
here
there's
no
corresponding
claim
that
if
there
isn't
this
procedure,
that
the
dissidents
are
required
to...
the
union
is
going
to
lose
any
constitutional
right.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
answer
to
that
may
be
to,
in
effect
to...
in
effect
to
rethink
the
need
for
the
arbitration,
or
the
legitimacy
of
it.
you
spoke
a
moment
ago
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question,
i
think,
of
the
inevitability
of
there
being
some
such
arbitration
scheme,
but
i'm
not
sure
that
i
see
that.
why
couldn't
the
court
just
as
well
have
said
the
interests
at
stake
here
require
that
cases
of
this
sort
be
handled
expeditiously
in
the
federal
court
so
that
you
get
a
quick
hearing...
i
mean,
the
civil
analogue
of
speedy
trial...
and
have
one
proceeding
in
a
federal
court
and
get
it
over
fast?
is
that
any
less
inevitable,
if
you
will,
than
the
scheme
that
we
set
up
in
hudson?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
be...
would
you
be
happy
to
have
us
go
in
that
direction
and
say
we
really
did
not
think
things
through
properly
in
hudson,
in
fact
it
will
be
for
the
federal
court
to
provide
the
speedy
hearing?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
what
is
your
experience,
again,
if
you
can
tell
me,
with
requests
to
have
one
or
the
other
proceeding,
either
the
arbitration
or
the
judicial
proceeding,
stayed
if
the
other
one
has
already
gotten
underway?
unknown
speaker
do
you
know
across
the
board,
again
in
a
broader
spectrum
of
cases--
unknown
speaker
--very
well,
mr.
anker.
mr.
lajeunesse,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
but
isn't
it
also
true
that
there
was
no
case
that,
before
hudson,
that
said
there
had
to
be
an
impartial
decision,
impartial...
what
did
we
call
it,
impartial
person
who
would
verify
these
expenditures.
where
did
we
get
the
authority
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
would
not
it
have
complied
with,
literally
at
least,
with
the
hudson
opinion
if,
instead
of
using
the
american
arbitration
association,
they
had
just
said
we've
got
all
these
figures
here,
we'll
submit
them
to
price
waterhouse,
or
young
&
young,
or
whatever,
some
independent
auditors
and
said
you...
you're
independent,
you
verify
these
figures
and
let
the
minority
members
know
what
you
think
of
them.
would
that
have
complied
with
hudson,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
they
have
to
select
a
person
that
everyone
would
agree
is
impartial.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
this
auditor
does,
but
i'm
asking
whether,
just
starting
from
scratch,
instead
of
setting
up
an
arbitration
procedure,
suppose
if
they
thought
they'd
comply
with
the
language
of
hudson
to
just
say,
we'll
get
an
independent
accounting
firm
to
verify
all
the
figures
and
decide
which
ones
are
germane
and
which
ones
are
not,
and
we'll
publish
it
in
the
report
and
make
it
available
to
the...
to
everybody,
the
members
and
the
union
officers.
why
wouldn't
that
have
complied
with
hudson?
of
course,
if
the
members
didn't
agree
with
it
they
could
then
have
brought
suit
and
said,
well,
you
know,
there's
a
violation
of
the
first
amendment
and
so
forth.
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
hudson
itself
that
required
an
arbitrator.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
correct,
and
it
in
effect
said--
unknown
speaker
--it
in
effect
said,
and
your
cause
of
action
would
not
be
ripe
until
that
has
been
made
available
for
everybody
to
look
at.
unknown
speaker
we
did
require
a
hearing,
though.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
accept
that
a
price,
waterhouse
review
and
then
just
a
statement
issued
by
price,
waterhouse
saying
we
have
audited
all
of
this
and
these
statements
are
correct,
that
that
would
suffice.
unknown
speaker
under
the
language
of
our
opinion--
unknown
speaker
--it
did
require
it.
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
point.
i
thought
the
point
was
simply
whether,
of
course
that
your
client
has
a
cause
of
action,
but
is...
the
judge
isn't
going
to
decide
this
matter
until,
for
example,
the
union's
had
an
opportunity
to
do
certain
things,
such
as
present
your
client
with
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
how
the
money's
spent.
you
agree
with
that,
i
take
it.
unknown
speaker
if
they
do
it
in
a
timely
way.
unknown
speaker
fine,
and
it
also--
unknown
speaker
--exactly,
and
then
hudson
also
requires
that
the
union
should
have
a
shot...
i
mean,
they
have
to
run
their
union,
and
they
can't
have
five
people
going
to
five
differing
courts
which
could...
or
five
different
decisionmakers
all
putting
them
under
different,
you
know,
conflicting
obligations.
who
knows
what's
going
to
happen.
so
hudson
says
you
can
go
to
an
independent
decisionmaker
first,
and
i
took
it
that
that
was
justice
stevens'
question.
should
the
court
act
before
they
go
to
an
independent
person
and
say,
independent
person,
look
at
this
and
give
us
your
opinion.
you
know,
it
may
be
things
will
work
out.
it
may
be
that
all
the
dissidents
won't
have
to
spend
their
money
to
hire
a
lawyer
to
go
to
federal
court,
but
if
they
want
to
afterwards,
let
them
do
it.
now,
i
mean,
what's
wrong
with
that?
unknown
speaker
this,
i
think...
and
i'm
curious
about
your
view
of
this,
and
that's
why
i
was
pushing
it...
is
not
classical
arbitration.
i
take
it
that
they're
prepared
to
give
you
the
district
judge
who
would
afterwards
look
at
how
this
arbitrator
decides
the
matter
and
review
everything
de
novo
as
to
whether
or
not
the
factual
thing
gives
rise
to
a
nongermane
or
germaneness.
now,
that
begins
to
sound
like
price,
waterhouse.
what
the
arbitrator
is
doing
is
deciding
what
the
facts
were,
and
we
give
him
such
deference
as
is
due,
the
power
to
persuade
but
not
the
power
to
control,
something
like
that,
and
then
the
judge
decides
it
de
novo.
now,
from
the
point
of
view...
not
your
individual
clients
but
as
a
person
experienced
in
this
area,
wouldn't
such
a
thing
be
better
as
dissidents...
i
mean,
wouldn't
dissidents
prefer
such
a
thing,
rather
than
have
to
go
to
federal
court,
because
they
won't
even
give
you
that,
you
know.
if
you
have
a
federal
court
judge,
and
only
a
federal
court
judge,
they'll
say
fine,
so
be
it.
so
what's
your
view
on...
do
you
see...
i'm
being
a
little
elliptical
for--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
saying,
that
they're
trying
to
say
that
within
this
statute,
give
us
a
chance
before
the
judge
goes
ahead
to
do
certain
things
that
might
resolve
this
in
order
to
prevent
us
the
union
from
being
placed
under
potentially
conflicting
obligations.
that's
a
practical
way
of
working
this
out.
it
doesn't
really
hurt
your
clients
because
they
can
go
in
after
the
court
if
they
don't
like
it,
and
they're
better
off
than
if
we
don't
give
it
to
them,
and
when
they
go
into
court
later
on
they'll
have
a
judge
do
this
de
novo,
you
know,
on
the
law,
and
he'll
give
such
weight
to
factual
matters
as
you
might
give
to
an
accounting
firm,
knowing
that
they
know
more
about
it
than
you.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
took
out
of
this,
and
maybe
i'm
being...
you
don't
have
to
answer
if
you
don't
want
to,
but
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
does
the
american
association...
american
arbitration
association
which
mr.
anker
says
has
set
up
these...
do
they
require
that
members
of
those
panels
be
trained
in
the
law?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lejeunesse,
you're
essentially
saying
as
far
as
you're
concerned
your
clients,
thanks
but
no
thanks
to
hudson,
that...
i
mean,
you
really
didn't
want
any
of
this.
you'd
rather
just
go
straight
into
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
say
it's
inconceivable
when
justice
white
and
chief
justice
burger
both
said
that's
what
it
meant.
they
at
least
conceived
of
it.
unknown
speaker
so
it
was
not
inconceivable.
unknown
speaker
they
didn't
say
one
way
or
the
other.
the
majority
said
nothing
at
all
about
that--
unknown
speaker
--what
we
said
in
footnote
20
was
that
we
reject
the
union's
suggestion
that
the
availability
of
ordinary
judicial
remedies
is
sufficient,
and
this
was...
we
were
insisting
that
the...
we
were
imposing
obligations
on
the
union,
and
the
union
lost
that
case
100
percent.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
this
question.
supposing
you
prevail
with...
because
of
the
right
to
access
to
the
courts,
do
you
think
the
district
judge
having
such
a
case
could
say,
i
think
i'll
stay
proceedings
until
i
see
what
happens
in
the
arbitration?
unknown
speaker
how
does
article
iii
give
anybody
access
to
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'd
be
interested
in
seeing
exactly
what
provision
of
article
iii
you're
quoting,
because
i've
looked
at
it
often
and
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i'm
not
talking
about
what
this
court
said.
i'm
talking
about
what
does
article
iii
say.
unknown
speaker
but
not
in
reliance
on
article
iii.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
not
saying
that
it's...
article
iii
requires
that.
we
have
said
many
things...
times
that
certain
things
are
required
to
be
adjudicated
by
article
iii
courts,
but
not
simply
because
article
iii
says
what
it
does.
we're...
obviously
you
and
i
are
both
perhaps
straying
from
the
central
theme
of
the
case--
unknown
speaker
--so
let's
get
back
to
it.
unknown
speaker
while
we're
in
that
mode--
--i
think
maybe
the
due
process
clause
requires
it
to
be
determined
by
an
article
iii
court.
you
wouldn't
care
whether
it's
the
due
process
clause
or
article
iii--
--yes,
but
isn't
the
question
here
not
whether
it
must
be
determined,
but
rather,
when
it
must
be
determined,
because
i
guess
everybody
agrees
that
after
the
arbitration
you
get
all
the
discovery
you
want.
you
get
everything
you
want.
it's
just
a
question
of
whether
you
can
get
it
while
the
arbitration
is--
unknown
speaker
--still
going
on.
unknown
speaker
i
notice
the--
unknown
speaker
--i
notice
the
one...
i've
been
trying
to
think
of
an
example
of
compelled
arbitration
without
statutory
authority.
i
notice
that
the
northern
district
of
california
for
some
years
has
had
a
mandatory
arbitration
requirement
before
you
can
proceed
with
your
civil
action.
it's
nonbinding.
that's
the
only
one
i
can
think
of.
unknown
speaker
is...
imagine
on
this
early
dispute
resolution,
which
is
common
now,
but
the...
suppose
that
the
union...
what
i
want
to
try
to
find
out
is
how
you
do
you
think
this
is
going
to
work?
imagine
a
union
with
5,000
members
and
500
dissidents,
and
the
dissidents
range
from
the
people
who
really
are
angry,
you
know,
at
being
part
of
this
to
the
ones
who
sort
of
don't
care,
and
a
lot
of
the
ones
who
don't
care,
you
know,
would
like
to
have
a
simple
way
to
resolve
this,
but
some
of
the
ones
who
really
do
care
want
to
fight
to
the
last
ditch.
all
right,
on
your
theory
of
how
the
statute
is
supposed
to
work
out,
how
does
it
work
out?
i
mean,
the
union
will
think
well,
some
of
the
people
might...
you
know,
these
things
are
often
close.
the
courts
will
decide
one
way.
the
arbitrators
will
decide
another
way
on
many
close
questions.
perhaps
they're
intertwined,
so
that
the
reasonableness
of
a
relationship
between
germane...
you
know,
between
objective
and
expenditure
depends
on,
and
then
we
can
imagine
all
kinds
of
intertwined
things.
on
your
theory
of
what
congress
meant
to
do,
how
was
that
to
work
out?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
so
they
say,
we
can
tell
you
how
this
works
out
perfectly.
give
us
a
reasonable
time
to
set
up
our
impartial
decisionmaker
and
let
ones
who
are
hell-bent
on
court
go
there,
but
only
after
our
impartial
decisionmaker
has
decided,
and
that
will
prevent
inconsistencies,
and
that's
probably
what
congress
meant.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
take
your
theme,
which
is
the
ones
that
are
hell-bent
for
court
go
there
first,
we're
going
to
get
conflicting
decisions.
we
won't
know
how
to
plan
our
expenditures,
and
it
will
be
a
mess.
now,
i
take
it
that
that's
their
argument,
so
how...
what
do
you
say
about
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
can
the
multidistrict
litigation
scheme
solve
that?
i'm
not
quite
sure
how
that
works.
unknown
speaker
so
that
would
eliminate
the
conflict,
at
least
among
courts,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
if
the
court
reviews
the
arbitrator
the
court
has
the
last
word.
if
they're
going
on
simultaneously,
or
the
arbitrator
comes
later,
or
you
don't
know,
interspersed,
then
you
can
get
i
suppose
a
fairly
good
mess.
that's...
and
if
we're
trying
to
figure
out
what
congress
intended,
can't
we
assume
they
wanted
not
a
mess,
rather
than
a
mess?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
suppose
hudson
was
probably
beyond
the
contemplation
of
congress.
i
mean,
it
was
a
constitutional
decision.
it
wasn't
based
on
the
idea
that
this
is
what
congress
would
have
wanted,
so
that
once
we
get
beyond
what
congress
would
have
wanted
it's
hard
to
say,
when
you
try
to
see
what
possible
remedies
exist
post
hudson,
to
translate
that
into
what
congress
would
have
wanted.
we're
pretty
far
away
already
from
congressional
intent.
unknown
speaker
mr....
is
it
clear
to
begin
with
that
hudson
applies
in
your
situation,
where
it
is
not
the
state--
unknown
speaker
--that
is
depriving
these
workers
of
their
first
amendment
rights?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
so
then
the
federal
government
should
set
up
the
arbitration
scheme.
i
mean,
what
hudson
said
was
that
the
person
responsible
for
the
first
amendment
violation,
what
would
otherwise
be
a
first
amendment
violation,
had
to
set
up
an
arbitration
scheme.
if
you're
telling
me
in
this
case,
since
it
involves
a
private
employer,
the
person
responsible
for
it
is
the
federal
congress,
by
having
adopted
the
national
labor
relations
act
that
enables
these
dues
to
be
charged,
then
let
the
federal
government
set
up
an
arbitration
scheme.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
isn't
that--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
lejeunesse,
one
of
the
things
that
you
said
about
why
you
don't
like
this,
you
said
there's
no
discovery,
and
i
was
trying
to
understand
what
the
complaint
is
that
you
come
to
court
with
when
you
don't
have
any
arbitration
in
the
picture.
you
just
say,
we
don't
think
they
drew
the
line
in
the
right
place.
do
you
have
to
be
at
all
specific?
do
you
have
to
say,
well,
we
think
that
their
expenditure
for,
say,
safety
lobbying
is
no
good,
or
do
you
just
say,
we
challenge
the
whole
thing,
and
then
we
can
discover?
unknown
speaker
wait,
wait.
in
general...
he
has
to
have
a
basis
for
that
general
objection.
you
just
can't
come
in
and
say,
i
object.
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
to
plead
that
you
have
reason
to
believe
that
the
union
is
expending--
unknown
speaker
--well,
he
does
under
hudson.
unknown
speaker
he
does
under
hudson.
see,
that's
the
very
point
of...
the
point.
until
a
member
has
the
facts,
he
doesn't
know
whether
he
should
spend
the
money
to
hire
a
lawyer
and
bring
a
lawsuit,
and
one
of
the
points
of
hudson
was,
we
put
the
burden,
as
you
say,
squarely
on
the
union
to
assemble
the
facts,
but
not
only
its
own
version
of
the
facts,
but
also
those
of
an
independent
verifying
that
version.
and
if
they've
done
that,
presumably
then
the
employee
has
a
basis
for
judging
whether
or
not
he's
been
short-changed,
and
if
he
has,
he's
free
to
sue.
you
see,
the
difference
between
this
arbitration
and
all
others
is
the
member
is
not
bound
by
the
arbitration
in
any
way.
he
hasn't
agreed
to
anything,
so
he's
totally
free
to
sue
once
he
gets
the
facts.
the
question
is
whether
we
should
ask
him
to
wait
till
he
gets
the
facts
before
he
sues.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
exhaustion.
the
opinion
itself
says
he
need
not
exhaust.
there's
no
requirement
of
exhaustion
on
the
member,
as
you
put
it
correctly.
all
he
has
to
do
is
complain
and
he
has
his
cause
of
action.
he
can
sue.
he
doesn't
like
the
arbitration.
he
starts
from
scratch.
he
at
least
has
the
facts
before
he
files
his
complaint.
that's
all
we
held.
unknown
speaker
he
has
the
union's
version
of
the
facts
verified
by
an
independent
appraisal.
now,
whether
that...
he
doesn't
have
to
accept
it,
but
he
at
least
has
that
much,
and
then
he
decides
whether--
unknown
speaker
--how
does
it
work
when
a
union
official
complains
that
the
employer...
not...
sorry,
when
an
employee
thinks
the
employer
is
trying
to
censor
him
or
something,
or
he
thinks
that
the
employer
should
have
given
him
an
excuse...
it's
related
to
his
religion
or
something.
i
mean,
there
can
be
thousands
of
grievances.
don't
people
have
to
go
through
the
grievance
procedure?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question,
though?
the...
in
the
arbitration
proceeding
that's
all
cost-free
for
the...
they
don't
have
to
participate
if
they
don't
want
to,
and
they
won't
be
bound,
but
once
you
start
discovery,
then
you
have
to
pay
your
own
share
of
the
cost,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it
really
is
an
extraordinary
claim,
that
you
just
come
into
the
court
and
say,
i
think
they
drew
the
line
in
the
wrong
place.
i'm
not
going
to
tell
you
anything
about
which
expenses,
we
just
say
we
want
to
have
full
discovery.
and
i
think
that
the
notion
of
the
arbitration
is
that
it
would
put
certain
limits,
because
the...
whether
it's...
some
kind
of
deference
to
the
arbitrator's
findings,
and
you
don't
want
to
have
any
findings,
as
i
understand
your
position.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
lajeunesse.
mr.
anker,
you
have
3
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
one
was...
certainly
republic
steel
was
consensual,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
another...
it
seems
another
defect
in
your
suggestion
is
that
this
is
not
a
remedy.
the
arbitration
doesn't
bind
the
union...
i
mean,
bind
the
member
in
the
slightest.
he...
it
may
change
the
calculation,
but
it's
certainly
not
a
remedy.
unknown
speaker
which
most
remedies
do.
unknown
speaker
what's
another
typical
exhaustion
case
that
you're
talking
about,
mr.
anker,
other
than
maddox?
unknown
speaker
but
those
are
governmental
remedies.
unknown
speaker
but
the
typical
reason
for
exhausting
judicial
administrative
remedies
is
to
get
the
view
of
the
administrator.
in
other
words,
the
government
policy
maker
might
rule
in
your
favor.
but
we
have
never
done
that
with
a
private
organization.
