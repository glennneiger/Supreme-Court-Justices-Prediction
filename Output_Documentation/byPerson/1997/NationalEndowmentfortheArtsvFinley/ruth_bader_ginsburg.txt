--but
that's
the
problem,
what
it
means,
that...
and
that's...
the
government
tells
us,
this
is
what
it
means,
and
you
say
no,
it
can't
mean
that,
and
two
courts
have
said
it
can't
mean
that.
and
yet
the
government
is
saying,
here
were
words,
decent,
respect.
they
can
be
interpreted
different
ways,
and
usually
i
thought
it
was
the
obligation
of
a
government
officer
to
give
words
a
meaning
that
renders
them
consistent,
not
inconsistent
with
constitutional
limitations,
and
yet
you're
insisting
that
government
officers
take
the
position
with
respect
to
these
two
words
that
they
interpret
them
in
the
way
that
would
be
most
offensive
to
the
constitution.
