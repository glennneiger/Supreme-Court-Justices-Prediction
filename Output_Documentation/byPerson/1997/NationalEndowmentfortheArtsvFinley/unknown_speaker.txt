unknown
speaker
i'm
sure
the
court
is
as
anxious
as
i
am
to
get
to
the
merits.
do
you
think
this
case
is
justiciable?
you
took
the
position
in
the
district
court
that
it
was
not.
what's
the
best
case
that
makes
it
justiciable,
if
you
think
it
is?
it
seems
remote.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
not
concrete.
the
plaintiff
originally
sued
because
he
didn't
get
a
grant.
then
he
sued
because
he
did.
i
don't
know
what
he
wants
to
produce.
i
don't
know
if
he's
been
denied
any
specific
rights.
unknown
speaker
i'm
dealing
with
the
question
in
the
abstract,
it
seems.
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
let
me
see
if
i
understand
you.
i
gather
that
you
have
no
doubts
on
the
article
iii
question
if
your
interpretation
of
the
statute
is
not
correct--
unknown
speaker
--in
this
facial
challenge.
the
statute
which
says,
taking
into
account,
requires
that
in
passing
upon
the
applications
the
panels,
diverse
though
they
may
be,
must
take
into
account
decency
and
the--
unknown
speaker
--beliefs
and
values,
right,
okay.
unknown
speaker
do
they,
indeed,
ensure
that
they
have
decent
panels?
i
mean,
how
do
they
go
about
ensuring
that?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
but
that's
just
half
of
it.
i
mean,
it
says
decency,
standards
of
decency
and
respect
for
diverse
beliefs
and
values.
i...
it's...
i
guess
it's
easy
to
get
diverse...
maybe
it's
easy
to
get
diverse,
but
how
do
they
ensure
decency?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
in
the
process?
unknown
speaker
in
the
process
of
selecting
the
panel?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
take
into
account
standards
of
decency
in
selecting
the
panel?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
how
you
do
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
quite
apart
from
the...
what
the
nea
has
done,
i've
got
some
difficulties
about
the
standing
question
akin
to
those
that
justice
kennedy
mentioned.
i
mean,
certainly
people
can't
just
walk
in
off
the
street
and
make
a
facial
challenge
to
a
statute,
can
they?
they
have
to
have
some
connection
with
what's
being
done
under
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
you
can
take
one
position
in
the
legislature
and
another
in
the
courts.
the
question
is,
what
does
the
statute
say,
is
there
any
injury,
and
i--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
waxman,
could
we
talk
about
the
statutory
language?
you
know,
just
reading
it,
i
thought
it
meant
that
the
chairperson
of
the
nea
had
to
ensure
that
its...
that
the
regulations
and
procedures
were
to
provide
that
artistic
excellence
and
artistic
merit
are
the
criteria,
but
in
considering
the
excellence
and
merit,
they
have
to
take
into
consideration
general
standards
of
decency
and
respect
for
diversity.
that
the
interpretation
suggested
by
the
agency
that
just
setting
up
the
panels
differently
was
enough
strikes
me
as
possibly
in
conflict
with
the
language
of
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that
is
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
do
we
nonetheless
have
a
justiciability
question,
or
do
you
think--
unknown
speaker
--if
that's
the
meaning
of
the
statute
we
don't
have
a
problem
of
justiciability?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
they
have
to
have
suffered
a
denial?
i
mean,
their
claim
is
that
the
statute
on
its
face,
if
read
as
justice
o'connor
suggested,
in
effect
is
a
limitation
based
on
viewpoint
which
tends
to
and
reasonably
will
tend
to
affect
both
the
production
of
art
and
the
applications,
so
that
even
before
you
get
to
the
stage
of
granting
or
denying,
you
in
fact
will
have
had
an
impermissible
effect.
isn't
that
their
argument?
unknown
speaker
now,
are
you
suggesting
that
we
would
find
it
nonjusticiable
because
they
have
not
gone
through
the
process
of
defining--
unknown
speaker
--are
you
saying,
general
waxman,
that
if
the
law
is
as
you
say
it
is,
then
nobody
is
being
hurt
because
these
words
are
largely
hortatory,
is
that
essentially
your
position,
and
that
challengers
can't
say,
agency,
you've
got
it
wrong,
you
have
to
interpret
this
more
strictly
against
us
than
you're
willing
to
do?
is
that
the
essence
of
your
justiciability--
unknown
speaker
--even
if
your
reading
is
wrong,
aren't
you
saying--
unknown
speaker
--that
even
if
your
reading
is
wrong?
unknown
speaker
but
how
would
we
even
get
to
that?
you
see,
if
the
challengers
are
stuck
with
what
the
agency
says
the
law
is,
because
that's
the
only
thing
that's
being
applied
currently,
how
can
a
challenger
then
require...
bring
this
question
to
us
unless
what
they're
saying
is,
what's
on
today
could
be
off
tomorrow,
and
that's
their
real
concern,
because
you're
not
saying
that
the
only
construction
of
these
words
is
the
one
that
you're
putting
on
it.
unknown
speaker
hasn't
it
had
8
years,
hasn't
it
had
8
years
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
even
issuing
a
reg?
unknown
speaker
why
didn't
the
government
seek
a
stay
from
a
single-judge
injunction?
unknown
speaker
you
weren't
around
then,
either,
right?
unknown
speaker
but
that's
in
the--
unknown
speaker
--general
waxman,
that's
been
affirmed
on...
that
view
that
the
law
is
unconstitutional
been
affirmed
on
appeal,
and
there
was
a
denial
of
rehearing
en
banc.
unknown
speaker
nobody
sought
a
stay
from
this
court.
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
are
you
trying
to
persuade
us
that,
even
after
the
statute
was
passed,
andres
serrano
would
have
the
same
chance
of
getting
a
grant
as
he
did
before?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
what
you're
arguing.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
he
has
a
lesser
chance,
doesn't
the...
hasn't
the
statute
had
some
impact?
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you're
going
to
have
a
hard
time
persuading
me
the
statute's
essentially
meaningless,
which
is
basically
what
you're
arguing.
unknown
speaker
i
have
the
same
problem.
suppose
the
statute
said
that
each
and
every
grant
must
meet
the
following
standard,
and
then
it
set
forth
the
statutory
standard,
and
that
each
panel
member
will
certify
that
as
to
each
particular
artist
whose
work
has
been
approved,
that
this
statute
has
been
met,
is
your
position
the
same?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
would
think--
unknown
speaker
--i
would
think
that
most
artists
would
say
that
they're
interested
primarily
in
mode
of
expression.
did
picasso
have
a
viewpoint?
i
think
he
was
more,
much
more
interested
in
mode
of
expression.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
ultimately
that's
an
unstable
line
you're
drawing.
unknown
speaker
well,
will
you
help
me
with
some
just
basic
inquiry?
if
the
federal
government
wants
to
buy
artwork
to
put
in
the
capitol,
i
assume
it
can
go
out
and
select
works
of
art
that
its
committee
thinks
are
decent
and
represent
diversity,
and
can
spend
the
federal
money
for
that
kind
of
art,
and
it
isn't
open
to
challenge,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
if
the
government
wants
to
educate
children,
or
people,
and
chooses
to
speak
by
way
of
paying
for
certain
kind
of
artistic
expression
as
a
means
of
the
government
speaking
and
educating,
and
insists
on
decency
and
diversity,
it
can
do
that.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
here,
it
has
a
limited
amount
of
money
to
give
away.
now,
what
is
it
that
makes
it
impossible
for
the
government
to
give
a
limited
amount
of
money
away
on
the
same
standards?
is
the
government
not
speaking?
i
mean,
what
do
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
may
i
suggest
that
maybe
there
is
something
different?
maybe
if
a
faithful
executive
is
trying
to
carry
out
the
legislative
will,
the
message
that
comes
from
the
whole
history
of
this
is,
don't
fund
serrano
or
mapplethorpe.
i
think
that
that's
the
concern,
and
not
the
rosenberger
v.
rust,
or...
that,
if
i
am
an
executive
who
is
trying
to
be
faithful
to
the
legislative
will,
i
know
what
prompted
this,
so
why
don't
i
say,
well,
that's
my
marching
orders.
i
know
what
the
legislature
didn't
want.
unknown
speaker
general
waxman,
i
thought
your
first
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
question
was
going
to
be,
so
what?
i
thought
that
what
you
responded
to
justice
o'connor
was,
the
government
doesn't
have
to
buy
mapplethorpe
pictures
to
hang
up
itself,
and
so
also
when
it
funds
the
arts,
it
doesn't
have
to
fund
mapplethorpe,
and
it
can
say
we
don't
like
mapplethorpe.
unknown
speaker
you
knew
i
was
going
to
say
that.
unknown
speaker
but
why
isn't
he
right?
why
isn't
he
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
does
the
government
have
to
or
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
constitutionally
principled
for
the
government
to
do
this
by
a
wink-wink,
nudge-nudge--
[laughter]
--approach,
which
is
what
you're
suggesting,
that
they
pass
a
statute
which
is
really
meaningless,
but
everybody
knows
what
it
means?
unknown
speaker
but
you
assume
that
that's
unconstitutional.
what
if
congress
doesn't
name
names?
it
just
says,
no
crucifixes
in
urine.
can
it
say
that?
unknown
speaker
can
it
say
that?
it
doesn't
name
any
names.
unknown
speaker
so
you
in
effect
are
saying,
i'm
not
going
to
rest
my
argument
on
the
claim
that
the
government
is
hiring
anyone
to
speak
here,
or
that
what
it's
doing
bears
an
analogy
to
that,
or
that
in
fact
the
government
is
buying
art,
or
that
it
bears
an
analogy
to
that.
you're
really
saying
there's
a
third
rule,
the
government...
the
government
as
distributor
of
largesse
to
the
arts,
and
that,
that's
a
third
rule,
but
you're
not
saying
that
the
government
is
either
the
speaker
or
the
buyer,
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
what's
it
buying?
unknown
speaker
what
does
it
own,
when
it...
after
the
grant?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
king
ended
up
with
the
picture.
the
government
is
not
ending
up
with
the
picture.
unknown
speaker
okay,
then
you
are
saying
there
is
an
art
patrons
rule.
i
take
it
you're
not
hitching
your
argument
either
to
the
claim
that
the
government
is
buying,
or
the
claim
that
the
government...
what
is
my--
--is
speaking.
is
itself
the
speaker.
unknown
speaker
is
hiring
its
speaker.
unknown
speaker
why
are
they
required,
when
they're
not
required
to
do
this
at
all?
why
is
the
government
required,
when
the
government
is
not
required,
in
fact,
to
fund
the
arts
at
all?
where
does
the
requirement
come
from?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
general
waxman.
mr.
cole,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
rosenberger
was
quite
different
from
this,
mr.
cole.
there
were
just
a
number
of...
everybody
was
going
to
get
something
in
rosenberger
except
the
people
who
wanted
to
do
something
religious.
here,
the
government
doesn't
purport
to
say
we're
going
to
give
grants
to
everybody
that
wants
it.
there's
a
definite
degree
of
selectivity
involved.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
quite
different,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
correct
in
making
the
distinction.
there
were
no
aesthetic
judgments
to
be
made.
there
were
no
subjective
judgments
to
be
made.
if
you
were
a
student
newspaper
you
fell
within
the
program.
that
was
it.
and
i
think
your
statistical
analysis
is
misleading,
because
nea
statistics
are
that
they
have
only
so
many
funds
and
they
base
it
on
aesthetics.
the
only
reason
there
were
rejections
in
rosenberger
was,
they
just
didn't...
they
weren't
the
kind
of
newspapers
that
were
under
the
program.
so
i
think
the
chief
justice
is
correct
in
the
distinction
he
makes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
may
i
suggest
that
one
is
a
prize
or
an
award,
and
there
really
is
a
difference
between
a
student
activity
fund
that
if
you're
not
social
and
you're
engaged
in
some
respectable
student
activity
you
get
it,
and
an
award,
a
prize,
a
grant
that
is
highly
selective,
and
so
i
quite
agree,
and
i
don't
think
that
you
can
maintain
that
this
is
just
like
rosenberger,
just
like
a
bulletin
board,
anybody
can
put
up
their
names
or
draw
from
that
pot
except
certain
people.
unknown
speaker
you're
a
better
predictor
than
i
am.
i'm
not
at
all
sure
it
wouldn't
have
come
out
differently.
unknown
speaker
my
record's
not
too
good.
i
wouldn't--
[laughter]
i
wouldn't
give
up
too
easily.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
decency
or
indecency
is
viewpoint-based.
i'm
not
sure
it
is.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
that
respect
is
a
viewpoint-based
thing,
or
diversity.
i
don't
even
know
what
this
is,
and
you've
got
some
kind
of
a
facial
challenge
here,
i
gather.
unknown
speaker
and
i'd
be
interested
for
you
to
also
pursue
whether
we
have
an
article
iii
case
at
all
here.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you
don't
argue
here
that
somehow
the
government
has
created
some
kind
of
a
public
forum,
do
you?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
hear
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
talking
about
a
public
forum
in
the
sense
that
this
court
had
used
it.
do
you
take
the
position
and
rely
on
some
kind
of
forum
analysis,
then?
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
answer
the
question.
do
you
take
the
position
that
this
funding
program
creates
some
kind
of
public
forum?
unknown
speaker
yes
or
no.
unknown
speaker
i
think
i
would
agree
with
you
if
the
agency
here
were
applying
the
law
the
way
you
interpret
it
and
the
way
the
lower
courts
interpret
it,
but
i
do
find
it
strange
that
where
you
have
a
law
which,
however
unrealistic
the
interpretation
may
be,
the
agency
says,
we're
interpreting
it
in
such
a
way
that
we
will
fund
mapplethorpe
and
everything
else.
unknown
speaker
now,
that
may
be
wrong.
i
don't
know
how
anybody
on
the
other
side
of
this
issue
could
compel
the
agency
to
do
it
right,
but--
unknown
speaker
--but
why
did
that
hurt
you?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
may
i
stop
you
just
for
a
moment,
because
it
sounds
like
you
are
veering
away
from
a
case
that
would
be
fit
for
summary
judgment,
which
is
what
this
was.
i
take
it
there
would
be
some
dispute
about
what
went
on.
unknown
speaker
there
was
no
hearing
about
that,
to
develop
that.
unknown
speaker
the
government...
you're
making
assertions
today.
i
would
certainly
be
interested
to
find
out
what
the
government's
position
is
on
it,
but
i
thought
we're
dealing
with
a
ruling
as
a
matter
of
law
and
that
we
take
the
government's
position
of
what
they
say
this
statute
means.
that's
what
they
say
the
statute
means,
and
that's
what
they're
enforcing.
that's
what
they
represented
to
this
court,
and
to
say
no,
they're
not
telling
you
the
truth
about
what
standard
they're
applying
is
quite
a
charge
to
make.
unknown
speaker
he
was
the
chairman
of
the
nea
at
the
time?
unknown
speaker
they're
quite
vague
about
how
they
apply
it,
i
agree
with
that,
but
i
also
found
right
in
the
record
what
the
solicitor
general
just
quoted
was
there,
on
page
33,
the
instructions
that
they
give,
so
if
you
have
an...
i
assume
you
don't
object
to
that
as
a
correct...
my
basic
question
is,
given
the
uncertainty
that
you...
you
started
with
a
premise,
and
if
i
accept
that
premise
a
lot
flows.
you
said,
all
they're
doing
is
subsidizing
private
views
here,
but
in
looking
at
the
endowment
charter
it
sounds
as
if
they
have
a
lot
they
do.
it
talks
about
education.
it
talks
about
grants
to
schools.
it
talks
about
workshops.
it
talks
about
teaching
children.
it
talks
about
a
whole
host
of
things
that
aren't
simply
that
that
could
include
giving
money
to
somebody
to
teach
art
in
the
public
school
grade
4,
that
could
include
having
a
television
program
on
sesame
street...
dozens
of
things,
all
right.
is...
am
i
accurate?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
if
i'm
accurate,
how
can
you
have
a
facial
challenge
no
matter
how
you
interpret
indecency,
because
after
all
there
are
some
important
uses
where
the
most
tough
definition
would
apply.
unknown
speaker
well,
we've
said
you
can't
bring
a
facial
challenge
if
any
part
of
the
statute
can
be
constitutionally
applied.
unknown
speaker
if
you
say
it
could
be...
the
language
could
be
applied
where
children
were
involved,
you
lose
your
facial
challenge
there.
unknown
speaker
no,
that
wasn't
my
question.
my
question
was
basically,
you're
making
a
facial
challenge.
i
don't
see
it
says
all,
not
in
my
version
it
doesn't
say
all,
and
as
long
as
there...
the
problem
in
my
mind,
for
you,
is
i
can
easily
think
of
some...
some
instances
of
importance
in
the
life
of
the
nea
where
it
would
be
obviously
appropriate
or
lawful
to
take
into
account
even
tough
standards
of
decency,
and
the
other
problem
for
you
is,
i
don't
know
what
the
word
decency
means.
it...
there's
certainly
a
sense
of
decency,
a
sense
of
it,
in
which
no
work
of
art
that
is
good
could
be
indecent.
it's
very
hard
for
me
to
think,
if
i
think
of
that
sense,
that
a
great
work
of
art
is
also
an
indecent
work.
i
can't
think
of
one.
so
since
we
don't
know
either
the...
let's
call
it
the
horizontal
meaning,
or
the
vertical
application,
how
can
we
now
strike
the
statute
down
on
its
face?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
should
we
also
strike
down
the
entire
nea,
because
at
the
very
beginning
of
it,
after
all,
there
is
at
the
very
beginning
all
kinds
of
language
about
how
this
has
to
be
done
with
general
regard
for
taxpayer
sensibilities,
and
do
we
have
to
strike
down
the
fcc
statute
because
the
fcc
says
award
licenses
in
the
public
interest,
which
has
been
plainly
interpreted
to
give
the
fcc
power
to
do
all
kinds
of
restrictions
in
the
area
of
indecency.
i
mean,
there
are
lots
of
statutes
on
the
statute
books
that
have
general
language
that
might
be
interpreted
by
an
agency
to
censor
in
accordance
with
viewpoints,
but
the
agency
doesn't
do
it.
correctly
so.
do
you
see
my
point?
unknown
speaker
my
question
is,
why
should
we
not
give
them
the
same
presumption
we
give
to
every
other
agency?
they'll
do
it
properly,
we
assume,
until
they
don't.
unknown
speaker
the
client
got
the
grant.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
so
no
matter
how
the
agency
itself
is
interpreting
the
statute,
because
you
claim
that
the
possibility
of
interpreting
it
to
mean
what
it
says
is
substantial
enough
that
artists
who
are
developing
projects
are
not
likely
to
develop
projects
that
would
offend--
unknown
speaker
--the
statute
as
it's
written?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
the
agency
didn't,
because
i
think
that's
going
to
be
a
very
controverted
proposition
that
wouldn't
justify
a
summary
judgment.
let's
assume
that
the
agency
has
not
interpreted
it
in
such
a
way
that
there's
any
constitutional
violation
of
the
sort
you
allege,
but
let's
also
assume
that
you
claim
that
in
doing
it
that
way,
they
are
not
complying
with
the
proper
interpretation
of
the
statute,
all
right.
would
you
not
still
make
the
argument
that
since
the
statute
says
something
different
from
what
they're
doing,
our
first
amendment
cases,
which
allow
challenges
of
a
much
broader
scope
than
in
other
fields,
would
enable
your
clients
to
say
that
they
are
being
deterred
from
developing
indecent
artistic
programs
by
the
statute
that's
staring
them
in
the
face,
even
though
today
the
agency
has
said,
well,
we're
going
to
ignore
it?
isn't
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
if
you
take
justice...
if
you
answer
yes
to
justice
scalia,
then
you're
just
sticking
pins
into
yourself,
basically.
you're
saying
that
things
are
all
right
now,
but
if
they
really
opened
up
on
this
thing,
they
might
be
worse
later.
unknown
speaker
now,
i
don't
know
why
you've
run
away
from
this.
suppose
you
had
a
municipal
office
that
issues
parade
permits,
and
it
sets
forth
criteria
that
are
plainly
discriminatory.
it
says,
we
won't
allow
parades
by
this
group,
that
group
and
the
other
group,
and
plainly
unconstitutional,
but
the
agency
in
fact
says,
well,
that's
what
it
says,
but
we
don't
really
apply
these
regulations
that
way,
you'd
have
a
first
amendment
claim
to--
unknown
speaker
--to
challenge
the
regulation
as
written,
wouldn't
you?
unknown
speaker
now,
is
it
the
case,
just
to
go
to
the
merits
for
a
second,
and
i'm
only
asking
these
questions
in
order
to
get
your
response,
say,
if,
in
fact
the
nea
wants
to
give
a
grant
for
somebody
to
produce
something
that's
public
work,
and
suppose
what
they
do
is
a
white
supremacist
group,
and
they
want
to
have
racial
epithets
all
over
the
picture,
and
the
nea
says
we
think
that's
an
inappropriate
use
of
this
money,
in
your
opinion
is
that...
and
we
can
imagine
the
most...
imagine
the
most
horrible
ones
you
can
possibly
think
of,
all
right,
and
they
say,
the
person
gets
up
there
and
he
says,
i'm
a
member
of
the
ku
klux
klan,
or
whatever,
and
this
is
my
point
of
view,
and
is
it
your
view
that
the
constitution
requires
the
nea
to
fund
that,
that
particular
applicant?
unknown
speaker
no,
no...
no,
i'm
sorry.
everything
else
being
equal,
what
the
person
says,
i'm
taking
you
at
your...
you
know--
unknown
speaker
--tough,
for...
take...
everything
you
say
is
correct,
and
then
we
get
to
this
point,
and
the
panel's
sitting
there
and
saying,
you
know,
i
grant
you
it's
as
good
a
work
of
art
as
anything
else,
purely
artistically,
but
i
don't
think
that
this
particular
work
of
art
is
appropriate
for
a
school,
for
a
public
place,
for
a
television
program.
and
then
the
hardest
case,
you
know,
which
you're
most
likely
to
say
yes,
that's...
i
agree
with
you,
but
it's
unconstitutional,
just
because
what
this
person
wants
to
do
is
go
and
exhibit
it
at
a
lot
workshops.
now,
what's
your
view
on
that,
on
the
merits
of
that
constitutional
question?
unknown
speaker
so
do
we
have
to
distribute,
or
exhibit
it
in
the
courthouse?
unknown
speaker
if
it's
a
program...
i
have
that.
if
it's
a
program
for
a
school.
unknown
speaker
so
they
have
to
exhibit
my
example
in
the
school.
unknown
speaker
well
then...
then...
i
take
it
then
that
you
would
say
that
if
general
standards
of
decency
were
left
out
of
the
statute
so
the
statute
read,
nea
must
take
into
consideration
respect
for
the
diverse
beliefs
and
values
of
the
american
people,
same
problem,
unconstitutional
viewpoint?
unknown
speaker
no.
my
hypothetical
is--
unknown
speaker
mr.
cole,
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
constitutional
position?
we've
talked
a
lot
about
what
the
statute
means.
assume
your
meaning...
your
reading
of
the
statute
is
entirely
correct.
as
i
understand
your
brief,
you
draw
this
distinction
between
the
government
as
a
speaker
and
the
government
subsidizing
private
speech,
and
i
have
two
questions.
first,
if
the
government
has
a
list
of
topics
such
as
say
no
to
drugs,
guns
are
dangerous,
preserve
the
environment,
one,
i
think
you
would
agree
they
could
subsidize
private
speech
by
saying
we
want
poems,
plays
and
so
forth
advocating
those
particular
causes.
unknown
speaker
and
maybe
have
a
list
of
20
things.
now,
if
they
can
do
that
by
subsidizing
private
speakers
to
come
up
with
creative
ways
of
carrying
that
message,
why
can
they
not
subsidize
all
other
speech
and
say,
you
may
not
contravene
any
of
the
messages
we
want
to
finance?
unknown
speaker
no,
it
isn't,
because
they
say
very
clearly,
it's
general...
for
all
kinds
of
speech
you
can
think
of
except
topics
1
through
20.
we
will
finance
those,
and
we
will
also
refuse
to
finance
those
who
oppose
those
topics.
now,
what...
there's
no
mystery
about
what
they're
saying.
you're
saying
that
it's
kind
of
a
misleading
thing
because
they
tell
everybody
we're
subsidizing
everything,
but
i'm
saying
the
statute
is
perfectly
clear
that
there
are
20
topics
that
may
not
be
controverted.
now,
there's
no
misleading
aspect
to
it.
unknown
speaker
why
can't
they
do
that?
unknown
speaker
your
whole
point...
your
whole
case
rests
on
rosenberger?
unknown
speaker
but
you've
just
agreed
it
can
if
you
give
a
list
of
20
topics
that
you
will
finance,
and
finance
private
speakers
to
speak
any
way
they
want
to
on
those
topics.
it
is
doing
it
on
a
purely
viewpoint-based
ground.
unknown
speaker
they're
financing
private
speech
on
the
20
topics
they
want
to--
unknown
speaker
--no,
they're
funding
artists,
but
artists
who
just
portray
these
particular
20
topics
that
they've
designated.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
surely
viewpoint
discrimination
if
you
say,
i'll
finance
a
program
that
says
don't...
say
no
to
drugs,
but
i
won't
finance
one
that
says
say
yes
to
drugs.
that's
viewpoint
discrimination.
unknown
speaker
i
see
where
you're
going
there.
can
i
give
you...
just
30
seconds
on
the
subject
of
the
ninth
circuit
opinion.
why
is
it
that
the
word
decency
or
respect
is
somehow
more
vague
than
the
words,
artistic
excellence?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
people
who
are
professionals
know
more
about
what's
artistically
good
than
the
average
person?
i
would
have
thought
there's
a
strong
view,
isn't
there,
that
what
is
good
and
beautiful
is
accessible
to
everyone?
unknown
speaker
oh,
my
good...
but
if
the
government
says
what
we
want
is
that
which
ordinary
people
believe
is
beautiful,
doesn't
the
government
have
a
right
to
fund
that
kind
of
program?
unknown
speaker
we're
talking
only
about...
i'm
talking
about
the...
sorry.
you're--
