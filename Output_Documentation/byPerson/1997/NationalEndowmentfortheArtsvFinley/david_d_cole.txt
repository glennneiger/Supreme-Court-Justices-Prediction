mr.
david
d.
cole
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
the
government
concedes,
this
is
not
a
case
about
government
speech.
it's
not
a
case
about
the
government
hiring
artists
to
express
a
government
message.
rather,
it's
a
case
about
the
government
selectively
subsidizing
private
speakers
speaking
for
themselves,
and
in
that
setting
two
fundamental
first
amendment
principles
apply,
and
the
decency
and
respect
clause
violates
both.
first,
the
government
subsidies
must
be
viewpoint
neutral.
this
court
has
held
that
in
lamb's
chapel,
in
rosenberger,
in
cornelius.
second--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--there
is
a
degree
of
selectivity
involved
here
but
there
was
also,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
a
degree
of
selectivity
in
rosenberger.
approximately
9
of
10
applicants
were
funded
in
rosenberger.
approximately
2
of
7
applicants
to
the
nea
are
granted.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
constitutional
difference,
and
i
think
when
you
look
at
rosenberger
what
rosenberger...
what
the
university
of
virginia
did
was,
they
said
we
will
fund
not
any
student
activity
that
comes
to
us,
but
any
student
activity
that
is
related
to
the
educational
purposes
of
the
university,
so
they
were
selective.
they
were
making
a
content--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i'm
not
sure,
justice
kennedy,
whether
there's
a
distinction
between
a
government
agency
which
makes
judgments
about
educational
purpose
and
allocates
funds
selectively
on
that
basis,
or
academic
merit,
which
is
what
public
universities
do
in
hiring,
and
the
nea,
which
makes
judgments
base
on
artistic
merit.
all
of
those
programs
are
selective.
they
take
into
account
consent.
but
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
you
cannot,
when
subsidizing
private
speakers,
when
the
government
is
not
speaking
itself
you
cannot
engage
in
viewpoint
bias,
and
the
decency--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--okay.
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
don't
think
that
the
rosenberger
case
would
have
come
out
differently
if
the
university
of
virginia
had
a
limited
pot
of
funds
and
it
said,
based
on
that
limited
pot
of
funds
we're
going
to
give
funding
to
those
groups
which
best
further
the
educational
purpose
of
the
university,
and
they...
it
turned
out
they
gave
them
out
to
2
of
7
applicants,
but
they
excluded
religious
groups,
groups
with
religious
perspectives.
that
would
still
be
an
exclusion
based
upon
viewpoint,
which
would
be
impermissible,
and
i
don't
think
the
case
would
have
come
out
differently
if
it
2
of
7.
the
court
in
rosenberger
said
scarcity
is
not
a
justification
for
viewpoint
discrimination.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
you
were
in
the
majority,
so
you're
a
better
predictor
than
i
am,
i'm
sure.
[laughter]
but
i
don't
think
it
should
come--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
guess...
i
think
what's
important
is
that
it
shouldn't
come
out
differently,
and
here's
why.
what
rosenberger
recognized
is
that
there's
a
very
big
difference
between
the
government
speaking
for
itself,
where
it
can
make
viewpoint
decisions,
as
in
rust,
and
where
the
government
is
facilitating
private
expression.
why
is
that
an
important
distinction?
i
think
that's
an
important
distinction
because
there's
a
very
big
difference
between
the
government
participating
in
the
marketplace
with
the
power
of
its
ideas
on
the
one
hand
and
the
government
engaging
in
a
kind
of
deceptive
ventriloquism
in
which
it
says
it's
funding
a
broad
range
of
private
expression,
but
then
it
uses
viewpoint-based
criteria
to
exclude--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
think--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--right.
well,
i--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--okay.
all
right.
well,
i'll
answer
your
questions
in
turn,
justice
o'connor.
first,
decency
and
respect
are
inherently,
as
they
are
used
in
this
statute,
viewpoint-based.
it's
common
definition
of
decency
is
conformity
to
accepted
standards
of
morality.
that's
what
this
court
said
in
pacifica,
conformity
to
accepted
standards
of
morality.
whether
something
conforms
or
not
is
a
viewpoint
distinction.
the
same
subject
matter,
if
it's
treated
in
a
way
that
conforms
to
accepted
standards
of
morality,
is
permitted.
if
it's
treated
through
a
viewpoint
that
does
not,
it
is
not.
the
same
with
respect.
the
respect
clause
requires
respect
of
american
beliefs
and
values.
if
you
are
disrespectful
of
american
beliefs
and
values,
you
are
disadvantaged.
if
you
are
respectful,
you
are
advantaged.
that...
the
court
in
rosenberger
said
the
way
you
distinguish
viewpoint--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
in
essence
that's
what
the
nea
says.
the
nea
says
that
the
arts
funding--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
they
say
in
their
mission
statement,
and
it's
cited
in
the
record,
that
they
create
a
national
forum
for
the
exchange
of
ideas
by
creating,
as
is
set
forth
in
the
statute,
a--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
think
under
forum
analysis
we
win.
i
think
under
forum
analysis,
as
this
court
has
said,
even
if
you
conclude
that
it's
a
nonpublic
forum--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--we
take
the
position
that
whether
it
does
or
not
we
prevail
because
this
court
has
held
that
even
in
a
nonpublic
forum
viewpoint
neutrality
is
required
and
vagueness
is
not
permitted,
and
these
criteria
are
both
viewpoint-based
and
vague.
if
i
could
address
your
standing
question
and
justice
kennedy's
standing
question
for
a
moment,
i
think
city
of
lakewood
v.
plain
dealer
publishing
clearly
establishes
that
there
is
standing
here.
in
plain
dealer...
in
that
case,
the
court
held
that
there
was
standing
to
bring
a
facial
challenge
by
a
newspaper
who
sought
access
to
a
benefit
for
speech,
access
to
news
boxes.
there
was
no
requirement
that
the
city
give
out
news
boxes,
but
they
had
given
a
government
official
unbridled
discretion
in
how
to
give
them
out,
and
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
the
chill
from
unbridled
discretion
statutes
and
the
allocation
of
benefits
to
speech...
no
entitlement,
benefits
to
speech...
can
be
alleviated
only
through
a
facial
challenge.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
it
certainly--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
it
hurts
us
for
the
following
reason,
justice
scalia.
the
government
has
been
quite
ambiguous
about
its
statutory
construction,
and
what
it
has
said
is
that
the
statutory
construction
it
is
advancing
to
this
court
today
is
the
same
statutory
construction
that
they
applied
for
the
year-and-a-half
before
the
statute
was
declared
unconstitutional,
so
let's
look
at
what
they
did
for
the
year-and-a-half
before
the
court
struck
it
down.
they
instructed
each
panelist
to
bring
their
own
standards
of
decency
to
the
table
in
making
these
decisions.
they
went
to
each
panel,
they
read
them
the
statute,
they
said
the
statute
says
that
you
must
consider
artistic
excellence
and
artistic
merit,
taking
into
consideration
general
standards
of
decency--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
think--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
don't
think
there's--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
all
i
can
say
is
the
record
is
very
clear.
the
reason
that
it
was
a
summary
judgment
is
that
there
was
no
dispute
about
this.
the...
chairman
frohnmayer
testified
before
congress,
was
asked,
how
do
you
take
into
consideration
general
standards
of
decency?
he
said,
well,
i
can't...
i'm
going
to
read.
he
said,
no
one
individual
is
wise
enough
to
be
able
to
consider
general
standards
of
decency
and
the
diverse
beliefs
and
values
of
the
american
public
all
by
his
or
herself.
these
are
group
decisions.
they
are
made
by
the
national
council
on
the
arts
as
well
as
the
panelists.
now,
if
the
chair
was
making
decisions
about
decency
in
selecting
panels,
he
wouldn't
say
these
are
group
decisions
made
by
the
council
on
the
arts
as
well
as
the
panelists.
he
was
then
asked,
what
happens
if
you
get--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--he
was
the
chair...
yes,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
he
was
the
chair
at
the
time
that
the
statute
was
being
enforced.
he
as
then
asked,
well,
what
would
you
do...
are
you
advocating
your
responsibility
in
applying
this
statute?
what
would
you
do
if
something
came
up
to
you
and
it
was
indecent
or
disrespectful?
he
said,
i
would
send
it
back
to
the
panels
and
the
council
if
i
thought
they
made
a
mistake.
so
he's
saying,
i'll
look
at
decency
to
make
sure
that
they've
not
made
a
mistake.
the
next
chair,
who
was
also
enforcing
the
statute
before
it
was
struck
down,
ms.
radice,
testified
in
congress
that
she
would
be
happy
to
and
would
apply
decency
to
the
grant-making
process.
so
i
think
you
have
to
look...
at
this
court
said
in
forsyth
county,
in
a
facial
challenge
you
have
to
look
at
how
the
agency
has
in
fact
applied
the
statute.
there's
no
dispute
about
it.
and
they're
quite
vague,
actually,
in
this
court
in
what
they
say.
mr.
david
d.
cole
yes.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
justice
breyer,
two
points
with
respect
to
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
breadth
of
the
statute.
this
statute
does
not
say,
take
into
consideration
decency
where
children
are
involved.
it
requires
the
agency
to
take
into
consideration
standards
of
decency
and
american
beliefs
and
values
in
every
application
decision.
secondly--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--and
our
position
is
that
this
statute
is
unconstitutional
because
it
is
viewpoint-based,
it
uses
a
viewpoint-based
criteria...
it
would...
it
would
be--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
don't
think
it
could
be
applied
where
children...
but
what
the
court
could
do
in
a...
what
the
agency
could
do
is
decide
whether
a
particular
application
was
suitable
for
children,
but
an
application
could
be
suitable
or
unsuitable
for
children
for
all
sorts
of
ways
that
don't
have
to
do
with
viewpoint.
what's
problematic
about
this
statute
is,
it
singles
out
art
precisely
because
it
has
a
nonconforming
or
disrespectful
viewpoint
and,
as
this
court
has
said,
even
when
the
government
is
allocating
subsidies,
if
it's
doing
it
to
private
speakers
it
can't
skew
the
marketplace
by
attempting
to
impost
that
kind
of
ideological
screen.
i
think--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
your
honor,
in
the
lakewood
case
the
government
came
forward
and
said
certainly
there
would
be
appropriate
considerations
that
the
mayor
could
use
in
deciding
how
to
allocate
these
benefits
to
speech.
the
court
said
that
is
not
permissible
to
defeat
a
statute
which
is
vague
and
gives
the
agency--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
first
of
all
they
did
it,
and
you
can
see
how
they
did
it--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--the
client...
the
way
that
this
statute...
the
way
that
this
statute
was
enforced,
they
never
issue
a
decision
saying,
you're
denied
because
of
indecency.
we...
i
represent
the
national
association
of
artists'
organizations,
which
represents
500
arts
institutions
and
individuals
who
have
regularly
applied
for,
are
denied
funding
by
the
nea.
what
the...
the
claim
is
that
the
application
of
such
open-ended
criteria
to
an
applicant
creates
a
chill
which,
as
this
court
held
in
lakewood,
requires
a
facial
challenge,
and
you
can't
sit
back
and
let
that
chill
affect
artists'
speech
in
the
meantime.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
think
certainly
it
applies
here,
where
the
agency
did
apply
it
in
a
way
that
was
chilling.
the
language
does
not
permit
an--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
that
is...
that
is...
we
would
make
that
claim,
but
we
would
also
make
the
claim,
justice
scalia,
that
the
government
itself
took...
has
taken
the
position
in
this
litigation
that
the
statute
is
indeterminate,
and
no
one
can
guess
how
the
chairperson
might
implement
the
statute.
mr.
david
d.
cole
no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i'm
saying
if
that
were
the
case,
but
that
is
not
the
case,
as
the
record
makes
absolutely
clear,
and
secondly,
i'm
saying
that
even...
even
if
the
agency
were
somehow
able
to
read
a
statute
which
says,
decency
and
respect
must
be
considered,
to
say
decency
and
respect
will
not
be
considered,
the
agency
can't
do
that.
the
statute
simply
cannot
be
read
in
that
way.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
that's
right.
all
i'm
suggesting
in
response
to
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
but
yes,
we
would
have
a
claim,
and
i
think--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
justice
breyer,
the
constitution
doesn't
require
the
nea
to
fund
anybody.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
our
position,
justice
breyer,
is
that
it
is
unconstitutional
for
the
government
to
set
up
the
funding
program
to
fund
private
speech
broadly
and
then
to
exclude
recipients
based
on
their
viewpoint.
now,
a...
the
examples
you
gave
might
be
denied
funding
for
all
sorts
of
reasons,
but
if
it
is
denied
because
of
disapproval
of
the
viewpoint,
that
is
what
this
court
has
said
the
paradigmatic
first
amendment--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no,
because
then
you're
engaged
in
government
speech.
of
course,
the
government
in
making
decisions
about
its
own
aesthetic
spaces--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--if
it's
a
program
for
a
school,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
consider
what
is
suitable
for
children.
i
don't
think
it's
appropriate
to
use
viewpoint
as
a
proxy
for
suitability
for
children.
suitability
for
children
could
take
into
account
all
sorts
of...
all
sorts
of--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--no.
if...
if
the
reason
that
they
have...
well,
let
me
step
back
for
one
moment.
first,
if
the
reason
is
that
they
disapprove
of
the
viewpoint
that's
problematic
generally.
in
the
school
setting...
in
the
school
setting
this
court
has
recognized
that
there's
a
legitimate
inculcative
role
that
the
school
board
plays,
and
can
therefore
make
all
kinds
of
viewpoint...
it
is
engaged
in
government
speech,
but
the
nea...
this
is
not...
this
is
a...
the
breadth
of
this
statute
i
think
distinguishes
it
from
anything
like
that,
and
this
is
kind
of
like
romer.
you
could
imagine
a
situation
in
which
it
would
be
appropriate
or
not
unconstitutional
to
deny
civil
rights
protections
to
gays
and
lesbians,
but
the
breadth
of
the
statute,
the
application
of
it
across
the
board--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
think
they
have
to
bread
together,
your
honor,
in--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--okay.
i'm--
[laughter]
on
your
hypothetical...
on
your
hypothetical,
justice
kennedy,
if
what
it
means
is
that
it
is
favoring
those
artistic
expressions
which
are--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i'm
just
saying
what
they
did,
and
i'm
saying
that
the
suggestion
that
decency
and
respect
might
be
considered
simply
through
picking
diverse
panels
and
no
more,
and
not
taking
decency
and
respect
even
into
account
in
choosing
the
panels
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
it
would
render
the...
954(d)(1)
redundant
of
959(c).
congress
in
the
statute
said,
decency
and
respect
are
the
criteria
by
which
applications
are
to
be
judged,
in
954(d)(1).
in
959(c)
it
said,
panels
shall
be
chosen
in
a
diverse
way.
you
can't...
they
must
have
meant
something
when
they
put
the
decency
and
respect
clause
in
the
criteria
subsection
of
the
statute,
and
not
in
the
panel
selection.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
mr.
david
d.
cole
well,
the
reason,
i
think,
is
the
distinction
this
court
drew
in
rosenberger
between
government
speech
and
facilitating
private
expression,
and
when
the
government
comes
out
and
says,
we're
engaging
in
a
government
speech
program,
we
know,
as
the
citizens
of
the
united
states,
it
is
the
government
speaking.
when
they
hire
artists
to
do
a
say
no
to
drugs
campaign
throughout
the
schools,
et
cetera,
we
know
it's
the
government
speaking.
we
can
take
that
into
account.
when
they,
by
contrast,
set
up
a
program
which
is
purportedly
a
program
to
fund--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that
was
rosenberger.
in
rosenberger
they
said,
we're
not
funding
religious
viewpoints.
mr.
david
d.
cole
oh,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
in
lamb's
chapel
this
court
held
that
viewpoint
discrimination
is
not
permitted
in
nonpublic
forums.
in
cornelius
it
held
the
same.
i
think
what
this
court
has
said
repeatedly
is
that
when
the
government
is
facilitating
private
expression
it
cannot
engage
in
viewpoint
discrimination.
mr.
david
d.
cole
oh,
well,
i'm...
if
you're
saying--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--if
they're...
justice
stevens,
if
they're
funding
topics,
that's
subject
matter.
that's
permissible.
mr.
david
d.
cole
right.
topics...
there's
no
problem
with
topics.
the
court
has
held
that
repeatedly.
it's
viewpoint
discrimination
which
is
impermissible,
and
it's
when
you
take
one
side
or
another
on
a
given
subject
matter.
under
this
statute,
if
you...
if
an
artists
has
a...
presents
a
nude
which
is
disrespectful
or
indecent,
that
viewpoint
is
disadvantaged.
if
it's
respectful
or
decent,
it's
advantaged.
that
is
viewpoint
discrimination.
and
finally,
i'd
like
to
say
the
court
has
consistently
required--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--that
is,
and
then
that
would
be
the
government
speaking
and
we
would
know
that.
but
the
government...
if
you
think
about
private
expression
in
this
country,
virtually
every
form
of
important
private
expression
is
funded
by
the
government.
the
print
press
gets
mailing
privileges.
the
broadcast
press
gets
licenses.
the
public
broadcasting
gets
taxpayer
dollars.
the
public--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
for
two
reasons,
justice
breyer.
first,
artistic
merit
has
been
applied
by
a
profession
so
that
there
is
a
set
of
people,
the
people
who
are--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--well,
i
think
there's
a
strong
view,
your
honor,
that
artistic
merit,
like
academic
merit,
and
like
character
and
fitness--
mr.
david
d.
cole
--i
think
what
the
government
does
not
have
the
right
to
do
is
to
exclude
viewpoints
which
it--
