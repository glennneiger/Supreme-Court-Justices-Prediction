mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
since
1965,
the
national
endowment
for
the
arts
has
selectively
provided
funding,
public
funding
to
arts
projects
on
the
basis
of
aesthetic
judgments
in
order
to
enrich
the
lives
of
all
americans
and
to
expand
public
appreciation
of
art.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether,
although
it
thus
expands
the
opportunities
for
artistic
expression,
congress
violated
the
first
amendment...
that
is,
made
a
law
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech...
by
directing
that
the
nea
ensure,
quote,
that
artistic
excellence
and
artistic
merit
are
the
standards
by
which
applications
are
judged,
taking
into
consideration
general
standards
of
decency
and
respect
for
the
diverse
beliefs
and
values
of
the
american
public.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
kennedy--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
kennedy,
i
think
that
the
question
of
article
iii
justiciability,
which
of
course
must
be
measured
at
the
time
the
suit
was
commenced
or,
really,
in
this
case
at
the
time
that
the
pre-1990
claims
were
settled
and
all
that
was
left
in
the
case
was
the
facial
challenge
to
the
1990
act,
is
a
close
one.
in
the
district
court
we
challenged
article
iii,
the
article
iii
justiciability
issue
both
on
the
question
that
these
plaintiffs
lacked
standing
and
also
because,
since
the
agency
had
adopted
an
interpretation
that
basically
concluded
that
the
1990
language
was
satisfied
merely
by
the
creation
of
extremely
diverse
panels
and
that
decency
and
respect
were
not
expressly
to
be
considered
as
independent
factors
at
the
grant-making
stage,
the
agency
was
in
the
process.
process
was
in
effect
no
different
than
it
had
been
before,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
diversity
of
the
panels
was
greater,
and
therefore
our
view
was
that
the
agency
was
not
doing
anything
significantly
different
after
the
district
court
ruled
than
before
it
ruled,
and
conversely,
if
this
court
were
to
agree
with
our
statutory
interpretation,
the
agency
would
be
permitted,
although
not
compelled,
to
continue
to
operate
the
program
precisely
the
way
it's
operating
now.
now,
this
was
not
an
issue
that
we
raised
on
appeal
or
we
raised
in
our
petition
in
this
court,
and
i
wish
i
could
tell
you
exactly
why
that's
the
case,
because
i
wasn't
there,
but
i
suspect
that
we
concluded
that
there
was
some
marginal
concreteness,
or
some
marginal
justiciability
here
by
the
fact
that
before...
between
the
time
that
the
1990
amendment
was
passed
in
november
of
'90
and
the
time
that
the
district
court
issues,
issued
its
injunction
in
june
of
1992,
we
actually
read
to
the
panel
members
the
language
of
the
statute.
we
then
told
them
that
they
were
to
judge
applications
on
the
basis
of
artistic
merit
and
artistic
excellence,
and
that
the
other
words,
the
words
that
follow
taking
into
consideration,
had
been
taken
into
consideration
by
the
creation
of
extremely
diverse
panels
in
which
each
person
from
a
diverse
walk
of
life
would
bring
his
or
her
own
individual
sensibilities
to
that
question,
and
we
argued
to
the
district
court
that,
in
fact,
the
case
was
not
justiciability.
there
was
no
injury
and
there
was
no
redressability
possible.
in
fact,
during
the
period
between
the
time
that
the
1990
amendments
were
passed
and
the
district
court
ruled,
three
of
the
five
plaintiffs
in
this
case
received
grants
under
the
standard
that
they
had
concluded
was
unconstitutional
and
a
fourth
had
benefited
indirectly
from
a
grant
given
to
an
organization.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
correct.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
respect
for
the
diverse
beliefs
and
values
of
the
american
people.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
if,
in
fact
our--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--they
ensure...
justice
scalia,
they
ensure
that
they
have
diverse
panels,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
chairperson
has
the
discretion
to
create
the
pro...
the
selection
procedures
any
way
she
or
he
wants,
so
long
as
he
is
satisfied
or
ensured
that
general
standards
of
decency
will
be
taken
into
account
in
the
process.
the
nea
thus
far
has
considered
that,
since...
for
most
people--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
the
process
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
the
process--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in...
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
the
process
of
deciding
which
proposals
will
be
granted
on
the
basis
of
merit
and
excellence,
and
here's
how
the
nea
has
construed
the
statute
to
work.
the
nea
chair
thus
far
has
concluded
that
whatever
factors
an
individual
takes
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
something
is
art,
nonethe...
not
to
mention
artistically
excellent
and
artistically
merit,
meritorious,
may
be
considerations
of
the
mode
and
form
of
expression
in
the
case.
it's
not
dispositive,
but
if
it
includes
a
mode
or
form
of
communication,
the
kind
of
thing
that
this
court
distinguished
from
viewpoint
in
denver
area,
and
pacifica,
and
pico,
and
bethel,
that
it...
the
nea
concluded
that
many,
if
not
most,
if
not
all,
certainly
at
least
some
people
in
deciding
whether
something
is
really
artistically
excellent
or
meritorious
or
how
much
it
is,
will
at
least
think
about
the
mode
or
form
of
the
presentation
that
the
artist
is
using,
and
that's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--absolutely,
and
what's
so...
i
don't
want
to
use
a
pejorative
adjective.
what's
so
unusual
about
this
case
is
that
the
plaintiffs
in
the
case,
who
were
very
successful
in
forcing
congress
to
reject
what
was
the
alternative
to
this
amendment,
the
rohrabacher
provision
that
would
have
prohibited
the
nea
from
funding
any
art
that
manifested
certain
viewpoints,
and
congress
instead
passed
a
compromise
provision
along
the
lines
of
the
recommendations
of
the
independent
commission
that
it
had
appointed,
the
same
organizations,
the
same
plaintiffs
who
were
successful
in
the
legislature
in
defeating
a
viewpoint-discriminatory
prohibition,
have
challenged
this
provision
on
the
grounds
that
our
interpretation,
the
way
that
the
nea
has
chosen
to
interpret
the
statute
is
wrong,
although
it's
wrong
in
a
way
that
benefits
them.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
what's...
right.
what's
unusual
in
this
case
is
that
the
courts
have...
are
being
asked
to
reject
an
interpretation,
an
application
of
the
statute
that
the
agency
has
reasonably
made
and
which
does
not,
concededly
does
not
violate
the
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
justice
o'connor,
both
lower
courts
agreed
with
you.
we
still
submit
that
there
are
two
possibly--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
not
sure.
i
know
that
the
plaintiffs
would
claim
that
insofar
as
any
decisionmaker
along
the
line,
whether
it
be
a
panel
member,
a
council
member,
or
the
chair,
takes
into
consideration
these
two
factors,
they
believe
that
they
are
harmed
in
some
way.
we
don't
think
that
they
have
demonstrated
in
any
tangible
way
that
they
have
established
injury,
in
the
sense
that
none
of
them
suggests
that
they
have
applied
for
an
application
and
been
denied
it
because
an
impermissible
reading
of
these...
a
viewpoint-discriminatory
reading
of
these
words
caused
it.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
guess
if
we're
talking
now
simply
about
justiciability
and
not
the
merits,
and
i'll
restrict
my
comments
accordingly,
first
of
all,
because
of
the
way
the
agency
has
interpreted
this
statute
before
it
was
very
shortly
enjoined
from
doing
it
at
all,
it
hasn't
had
the
occasion
to
define
the
terms
general
standard
of
decency
and
respect
for
diverse
values.
but
the
way
in
which...
if
this
court
were
to
conclude
that
the
statutory
interpretation
that
the
nea
adopted
was
not
only
the
best...
not
the
best
interpretation,
but
was
an
unreasonable
interpretation
by
the
agency
charged
with
carrying
it
out,
the
appropriate
course
at
this
point
would
be
to
allow
the
agency
to
define
the
terms
and...
in
order
to
determine
whether
or
not
they
are
in
fact
viewpoint
discriminatory
at
all.
we
contend
in
our
brief--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--not
because
they
haven't...
not
because
they
haven't
gone
through
the
process,
and
again
this
falls
a
little
bit
into
the
merits,
but
i
think
the
justiciability
is
very
much
in
question,
because
these
terms,
general
standards
of
decency
and
respect
for
diverse
beliefs
and
values,
can
be
defined
by
the
agency,
could
readily
be
defined
by
the
agency
in
a
manner
that
is
not
viewpoint
discriminatory,
as--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
that's...
that's
the
essence
of
why
we
think,
if
our
reading
is
right,
there
probably
is
not
much
of
an
article
iii
case
or
controversy.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
even
if
our
reading--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--even
if...
right.
the
point,
justice
ginsburg,
that
i
was
making
to
justice
souter
is
that
even
if
you
reject
that,
even
if
you
say
no,
what
this
means
is
that
when
these--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
that's...
we're
absolutely
not,
but
i
think
the
appropriate
course
for
this
court
to
take
if
it
rejects...
if
it
concluded
that
our
statutory
interpretation
was
unreasonable
would
be
to
permit
the
agency...
after
all,
none
of
these
people
have
grants
that
have...
this
is
not
an
as-applied
challenge.
the
appropriate
course
would
be
to
permit
the
agency
to
define
and
apply
general
standards
of
decency
and
respect
and
see
whether
it's
done
in
a
way
that
could
be
said
to
violate
the
first
amendment
at
all.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
precisely
to
the
contrary.
during
the
year-and-a-half
period
in
which
the
language
was
passed
and
the
district
court
enjoined
the
agency
from
applying
it,
it
said,
we
think
that
this
provision
can
be
satisfied...
that
is,
that
the
chairperson
can
ensure
that
these
things
will
be
taken
into
account...
when
you
have
a
diverse...
when
you
have
a
diverse
group
of
people
who
bring
their
own
sensibilities
to
bear
in
making
aesthetic
judgments.
since
then,
the
agency
has
been
precluded
from
doing
anything.
we
have
been
under
an
injunction
since
june
of
1992
from
implementing
this
statute
in
any
way.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
of
course.
we
can't
even
read
to
panelists
what
the
statute
says.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
think
the
answer...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
was
around--
[laughter]
i
was
around
in
the
physical...
in
the
existential
sense
i
was--
i
was
in
the
process
of
a
private
citizen,
indeed
a
private
lawyer
very
much
enjoying
the
arts
in
all
of
their
manifest
expressions.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
let
me
just
say
this,
we--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
true,
and
i
think
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
i...
if...
mr.
chief
justice,
if
i
can
just
get
to
what
i
thought
my...
the
pitch
was
going
to
be
after
my
wind-up,
the
point
is--
[laughter]
--that
the
agency
has
never
see
its...
the
agency
views
what
the
district
court
did
as
essentially
enjoining
it
from
doing
something
that
it
wasn't
doing,
and
didn't
particularly
think
had
to
be
done,
and
so
the
only
tangible
way
in
which
the
agency's
operation
of
this
program
has
been
affected
by
the
district
court
order
and
the
court
of
appeals
order
is
that
when
it
talks
to
new
panel
members
it
can't
read
them
the
statute,
read
them
the
words
of
the
statute.
it
just
tells
them
it's
artistic
excellence
and
artistic--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
don't
know
whether...
i
don't
think
we
have
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--decide
whether
he
would
have
the
same
chance,
but
what
i'm
suggesting
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i...
we
don't
think
actually
that
he
would
have
a
lesser
chance.
congress
rejected...
and
the
legislative
debate
which
we've
reprinted
in
our
brief,
in
our
reply
brief,
is
very
instructive.
congress
rejected
a
provision
that
would
have
denied
funding
to
the
merchant
of
venice
or
rigoletto,
or
d.
w.
griffiths'
birth
of
a
nation.
it
wanted
those
provisions
to
be
funded.
it
just
wanted
to
make
sure
that
in
the
process
of
deciding
what
is
the
most
excellent
art
in
a
program
which
is
designed
to
benefit
the
american
people
and
expose
people,
including
young
people
and
people
in
rural
areas,
to
the
benefits
of
artistic
expression,
that
those
things
were
taken
into
account.
the
agency's
view,
justice
stevens,
is
that
many
people...
i
know
it
would
be
true
of
me...
who
go
into
an
evaluative
process
as
to
whether
something
is
art,
or
excellent
art,
or
meritorious
art,
or
art
that's...
that
the
congress
can
spend
taxpayer's
money
to
fund,
one
of
the
things
you
think
about
is
the
mode
of
expression.
it
can
either
add
to
or
detract
from
the
merit
of
the
proposal,
but
it's
not
irrelevant.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
we...
i
feel
like
i'm
here
making
an
argument
in
support
of
a...
we
didn't--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
other
words,
if,
instead
of
having
two
criteria
with
considerations,
there
were
four
criteria
that
had...
and
each
thing
had
to
be
judged?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
our
position
would
be
twofold.
one,
because
we
think
that
standards
of
decency,
or
general
standards
of
decency
and
respect
for
diverse
values
can
be
defined
in
a
manner
that
does
not
take
account
of
viewpoint,
that
is
not
viewpoint
discriminatory,
for
that
reason
the
provision
would
be
constitutional.
as
a
fallback,
if
you
didn't...
if
you
thought
that
it
was
absolutely
unreasonable
for
the
agency
to
conclude
that
those
provisions
couldn't
be
defined
without
reference
to
viewpoint,
you
would
have
to
then
address...
we
would
have
to
then
address
the
very
difficult
question
that
congress
thought
in
passing
this
compromise
you
wouldn't
have
to
address.
that
is,
do
we
have
a
statute
that
establishes
independent
funding
prohibitions
that
can't
be
viewed
other
than
as
viewpoint
discriminatory,
and
we
do
acknowledge
that
that
would
pose
additional
first
amendment
concerns,
but
they
were
concerns
that
this...
that
congress
didn't
intend
that
this
court
address.
one
of
the
reasons...
the
congress
was
told
with
respect
to
the
rohrabacher
amendment
that
it
may
very
well
be
constitutional.
there
was
a
big
argument
among
the
first
amendment
scholarly
community,
and
they
very
deliberately
chose
a
provision
which
they
thought
was
going
to
not
embroil
the
agency
in
a
kind
of
litigation,
endless
litigation
over
its
meaning,
much
the
same
as
the
decision
that
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
i
may
just
finish...
much
the
same
as
the
decision
the
combined
federal
campaign
made
in
the
cornelius
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
do
respectfully
disagree
to
this
extent,
justice
kennedy.
there
is
no
doubt
that
in
considering
the
content
of
a
work
of
art,
you
consider
the
subject
matter,
the
medium,
the
mode
of
expression,
and
the
viewpoint
expressed
if
it's
a
kind
of
art
that
is
expressing
a
viewpoint,
or
could
be
interpreted
as
expressing
a
viewpoint.
this
court
has
recognized
on
several
occasions
that
decency,
in
the
term
that
it
was
used
in
pacifica,
and
denver
area,
and
pico,
and
bethel,
and
kohlmeier
is
distinct
from
viewpoint.
yes,
use
of
indecent
speech
or
controversial
speech
may
very,
very
well
add
to
or
subtract
from
the
force
of
the
message,
but
it's
not
the
same
as
viewpoint,
and
similarly--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--assuredly
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
believe
that
it
can.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
will
state
the
obvious
and
suggest
that
the
question
probably
would
be
better
answered
then
my
friend
professor
cole,
because
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
constitutional
problem
here
with
this
provision.
i
mean,
the
argument
on
the
other
side
boils
down
to
the
fact
that
3
years
ago
this
court
decided,
in
a
context
that
is
wholly
different
than
the
one
we
have
here,
a
case
called
rosenberger
v.
the
rectors
and
visitors
of
the
university
of
virginia.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
guess
i
have
a
couple
of
answers:
1)
a
chairperson
could
have
done
that.
chairpersons,
as
the
other
side
points
out,
were
highly
cognizant
of
political
concerns
without
the
enactment
of
this
rather
innocuous
amendment.
that's
number
1.
number
2,
what
the
1990
legislative
debate
shows
is
exactly
the
opposite.
the
point
of
view
expressed
in
the
rohrabacher
amendment
and
previously
challenged
by
representative
biaggi
that
certain
art
that
is
viewpoint
discriminatory
or
denigrates
religion
or
races
won't
be
funded
was
rejected.
and
the
legislative
history
is
shot
through
and
through
with
the
fact
that
what
congress
wanted
was
what
the
independent
commission
it
had
appointed
was...
had
suggested,
which
is
that
you
change
the
procedures,
you
not
employ
specific
content
or
viewpoint
prohibitions,
and
to
the
extent
you
want
things
like
decency
to
be
considered,
it
be
embedded
in
the
subjective,
aesthetic
judgments
about
what's
meritorious
and
excellent.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
knew
that
that
would...
i
knew
you
would
support--
[laughter]
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
may
i
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
if
you're
talking
about...
if
we're
talking
about
whether
congress
can
say,
okay,
the
nea
is
going
to
apply
the
following
standards
but
it's
not
going
to
fund
robert
mapplethorpe,
that
raises
many
different
constitutional
concerns
that
don't
have...
in
other
words,
going
to
single
out
one
particular
person,
at
that
point
may
violate...
it
would
have
to
be
scrutinized
under,
for
example,
the
due
process
clause
as
to
whether
there
is
a
rational
basis--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's...
that
is
not...
that's
not,
justice
kennedy,
what
we're
suggesting
was
done
here.
what
was
done...
this
is...
almost
a
year
ago
to
the
day
i
was
up
here
arguing
the
constitutionality
of
the
communications
decency
act,
which
was
an
act
that
congress
passed
without
any
hearings
and
without
any
debate,
and
without
hearing
anybody's
views,
and
was
just
stuck
in
on
the
floor
in
a
rather
quick
attempt
to
deal
with
a
serious
problem.
in
this
case,
congress
did
just
the
opposite,
and
it
rejected
the
kind
of
provision
for...
whether
it
had
to
or
didn't
have
to,
it
rejected
as
more
first-amendment
controversial
the
rohrabacher
provision
that
had
been
urged.
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i...
justice
scalia,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--justice
scalia,
i
am
not
assuming...
i'm
not
standing
up
here
arguing
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional.
i
think
it
may
well
be
that
in
the
unique
circumstances
of
public
arts
funding,
unlike
the
very
different
context
in
rosenberger,
viewpoint
distinctions
may
be
constitutionally
defensible.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think
the
government
is
the
buyer.
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it's
buying--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--this...
i
think
this
is
a
distinction
without
a
difference
to
our
argument,
but
it
is...
in
fact
it's
behaving
as
governments
and
sovereigns
as
arts
patrons
always
have.
when
the
medicis--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
king
did
not
necessarily
end
up
with
the
picture.
the
medicis,
for
example,
funded
art
that
was
placed
in...
all
over
their
realm.
the
same
people
who
funded
and
allowed
to
flourish
the
great
university,
that
forum,
that
community
where
free
and
uninhibited
expression
of
debate
and
views
occurred,
were
also
arts
patrons,
and
they
bought
and
funded
what
they
liked.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
i
think--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--yes.
to
the...
if
you're
asking
whether
we're
suggesting
that
there
is
something
unique,
particularly
unique
about
the
government
funding
of
the
arts
for
first
amendment
purposes,
the
answer
is
yes,
and
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
for
one
thing,
and
most
critically,
this
is
an
area
in
which
government
decisionmakers
are
expected
and
required
to
make
precisely
the
kind
of
aesthetic
judgments
which
are
subjective
and
may
take
content
and
viewpoint
into
account,
and
which
the
government
is
ordinarily
prohibited
from
doing.
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--unless
you
have
a
program,
justice
souter,
in
which
the
nea
is
simply
disestablished
because
of
a
belief
that
the
first
amendment
wouldn't
permit
funding
of
the
arts,
or
unless
you
can
set
up
a
program
where,
you
know,
the
proposals
that
were
on
the
thickest
paper,
or
the
ones
that
came
in,
you
know,
first,
were
granted,
inevitably
the
decisionmaker
is
going
to
be
making
the
kind
of
aesthetic
judgments
that,
for
example,
were
not
permitted
in
ward
v.
rock
against
racism.
thank
you.
