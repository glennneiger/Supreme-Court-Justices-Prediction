mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
test
case
for
thousands
of
cases
being
held
in
abeyance,
a
five-judge
panel
of
the
federal
circuit
held,
with
judge
mayer
dissenting,
that,
as
applied
to
exports,
the
harbor
maintenance
tax
enacted
by
congress
in
1986
is
an
invalid
tax
in
violation
of
the
constitution's
export
clause
rather
than,
as
we
contend,
a
permissible
user
fee.
the
provision
at
issue
was
enacted
as
part
of
the
water
resources
development
act
of
1986,
the
first
legislation
in
more
than
a
decade
to
authorize
development
of
new
facilities
in
the
nation's
harbors.
there
was
concern
during
this
period
that
port
development
projects
in
the
united
states
had
lagged
behind
those
of
other
developed
countries
and
that
this
was
contributing
to
our
severe
trade
imbalance.
at
the
same
time,
this
was
a
period
in
which
there
were
large
budget
deficits
and
objections
to
using
federal
funding
to
address
this
problem,
and
it
was
one
that,
as
judge
mayer
pointed
out
in
his
dissenting
opinion,
engaged
the
attention
of
congress
over
an
extended
period
involving
three
congresses
and
more
than
4
years
of
numerous
hearings
and
other
activities,
and
one
of
the
solutions
to
the
funding
problem
was
to
craft
a
system
of
user
fees
that
would
avoid
the
need
for
funding
out
of
general
revenues.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
in
this
instance
there
was
a
practical
problem
to
be
addressed.
improvements
were
needed
and
the
beneficiaries
of
these
facilities
could,
under
court
precedent,
be
charged
user
fees
to
defray
the
costs
of
providing
these--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--facilities
for
their
commercial
benefit.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't...
off-hand,
i'm
not
able
to
point
to
a
breakdown
in
the
statistics
in
the
record,
not...
certainly
not
in
what
we've
reproduced
in
the
joint
appendix.
perhaps
my
colleagues
will
be
able
to
find
something
on
that.
i
do
want
to
say
that
the...
one
of
the
most
difficult
problems
that
was
faced
in
this
massive
legislative
consideration
was
how
to
craft
an
equitable
and
workable
system
of
user
fees
in
the
context
of
the
multitude
of
difficulties
that
were
brought
to
congress'
attention
by
various
industry
and
port
representatives
as
well
as
members
of
the
executive
branch.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
perhaps
was
unfortunate
choice
of
nomenclature--
[laughter]
--but
as
the
court's
decisions
do
make
it
clear
that
nomenclature
is
not
in
itself
controlling.
now--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
exactly
correct,
and
if
i
may
i
would
like
to
elaborate
on
this
with
reference
to
the
legislative
consideration
of
this
very
issue,
but
first
i
just
want
to
interject
in
response
to
justice
kennedy's
previous
question
that
on
page
63
of
the
joint
appendix
there
are
some
statistics
that
will
shed
some
light
on
the
question
that
he
asked.
now,
we
have
in
our
references
isolated
from
the
massive
record
of
legislative
consideration
portions
which
are
themselves
quite
hefty
that
dealt
quite
specifically
with
the
user
fee
problem
and,
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
turn
briefly
to
some
brief
excerpts
from
a
statement
that
senator
hatfield
made
which
encapsulates
the
difficulties
and
the
reasons
for
the
crafting
of
it.
it's
worth--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
think
it
bears
on
the
reasons
why
the
particular
kinds
of
objections
that
are
being
raised
to
the
way
the
fee
was
crafted
may
be
not
aspects
of
the
fee
that
actually
disadvantage
exports
but
to
some
extent
may
be
aspects
that
were
designed
to
be
advantageous
to
exports,
and
also
shows
the
sum
of
the
serious
economic
dislocations
that
were
sought
to
be
avoided
in
trying
to
find
an
equitable
manner
of
putting
this
fee
together,
and
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--of
course,
we
do
not
contend
that
the
difficulties
and
the
magnitude
of
the
effort
that
congress
put
in
would
excuse
a
constitutional
violation,
but
we
do
contend
that
it
is
too
facile
for
others
to
contend
that
a
court
should
ignore
these
aspects
of
the
legislative
consideration
and
merely
hypothesize
whether
theoretically
it
could
think
of
a
system
that
might
seem
more
appropriate
to
the
court,
which
is
insulated
from
the
legislative
concerns
that
were
before
the
congress.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
part
of
the
reason
that
it
took
that
many
years
for
the
congress
to
craft
a
solution,
because
they
started
off
with
some
of
those
same
assumptions,
but
found
that
they
couldn't
work
it
out
that
way
for
very
serious
reasons.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
right.
these
are
brief--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--these
are
brief
excerpts
of
what
congress
thought
it
was
doing
and
why,
and
i
might
interject
a
few
comments
as
i
go
along
here.
in
senator
hatfield's
statement,
and
it's
in
this
hearing
called
user
fees
for
ports
and
waterways
that
we
cite
at
the
bottom
of
page
4
of
our
brief,
he
starts
off
pointing
out
we
have
not
had
a
major
authorization
in
this
area
for
15
years.
there
are
many
economic
and
political
reasons
for
this
delay,
but
the
resolution
of
the
user
fee
component
is
a
key
element
in
getting
a
bill
to
the
floor
and
passed.
5
years
ago
i
convened
a
bipartisan
group
to
explore
legislative
proposals
addressing
the
expectations
of
the
administration
for
user
fees
while
taking
into
account
the
economic
realities
of
the
navigation
economy
and
the
users
of
the
nation's
waterways.
over
that
period
i've
introduced
three
separate
and
distinct
proposals,
one
of
which
he
explains
became
the
bill
that
congress
later,
shortly
thereafter
enacted.
he
then
explains,
we
reserved,
meaning
rejected
in
context,
user
fees
based
on
tonnage
because
they
disproportionately
would
effect
bulk
cargo
marketability
when
compared
to
their
impact
on
containerized
cargo.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
oregon.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
was
talking
about
a
bipartisan
group--
[laughter]
--that
spent
years
of
study
on
this.
he
was
not...
these
are
not
views
stated
individually.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
it
depends...
i
mean,
it's
not
a
real
user
fee...
tonnage
is
not
the
only
measure
of
economic
value
that
someone
secures
from
facilities
in
these
days
of
containerized--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
a
measure--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
a
measure
of
use.
if
i
may
just,
in
answering
this,
the
very
next
sentence
says
that
a
fee
based
on
tonnage
also
would
disadvantage
export-dependent
ports
in
contrast
to
import-dependent
ports.
one
of
their
concerns
was
that
our
export
trade
would
be
hurt
by
a
user
fee
based
on
this.
much
of
our
export
was
and
is
bulk
commodities,
grains,
iron
ore,
which
was
having
difficulty
competing
in
international
trade
from
the
great
lakes
ports,
which
were
suffering
some
depression
at
the
time,
lumber,
as
is
pointed
out,
and
other
wood
products.
the
bipartisan
group
also
rejected
a
port-specific
approach
to
fees
because
it
would
have
the
effect
of
disadvantaging
ports
with
higher
operation
and
maintenance
costs
and
could
cause
consolidation
of
port
facilities
to
a
few
super
ports.
this
could
have
severe
economic
implications
for
scores
of
communities
across
the
country.
so
then
he
explains
that
the
approach
they
finally
chose
to
adopt
is
a
nationally
uniform
single-tier
fee
based
on
a
percentage
of
cargo
value,
and
this
ad
valorem
concept,
as
he
explains
it,
equitably
balances
containerized
versus
bulk
cargoes,
places
all
ports
on
an
equal
footing,
and
does
not
affect
the
marketability
of
any
product
or
commodity.
it
also
treats
all
coastal
ranges
of
the
continental
u.s.
in
the
same
manner,
east
and
west
coast,
great
lakes,
and
gulf
coasts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
is
very
similar.
in
fact,
the
trust
fund--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
wouldn't
go
this
far,
but
the
particular
concern
that
congress
was
addressing
here
was
the
disadvantage
to
the
commercial
use
of
our
ports
and
to
commerce
resulting
from
the
outmoded
nature
of
the
facilities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
of
course
not,
but
it
would
mean
that
it
would
become
a
matter
of
general
funding.
in
any
event--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i
think
this
court's
jurisprudence
in
distinguishing
taxes
from
user
fees
shows
that
it
is
a
more
variegated
distinction
than
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
those
cases
all
had
their
root
in
a
case
called
pace
v.
burgess,
which
was
an
export
clause
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
true,
but
it
also
made
a...
but
ad
valorem
charges
have
since
been
upheld
as
permissible
methods
of
user
fees.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
in
other
contexts
where
constitutional
objections
were
raised.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i'm
trying
to
set
this
up
in
context.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
yes,
and
i
have
to
add
one
further
consideration
that
inhibited
the
legislative
consideration,
and
that
was
it
was
all
done
against
a
backdrop
of
awareness
of
our
international
trade
relations
and
international
agreements
with
our
trading
partners,
which
also
do
not
supersede
constitutional
limitations,
but
they're
relevant
to
whether
congress
was
going
to
be
able
to
solve
this
user
fee
question.
because
those
agreements...
it
was
gatt
at
that
time,
and
now
wto...
in
which
there
have
been
reciprocal
reductions
of
tariffs,
those...
there
are
expectations
and
obligations
that
prevent
members
in
those
agreements
from
discriminating
against
the
foreign
industry
in
favor
of
the
domestic
industry.
and
even
though
the
measure
adopted
here
was
one
that
generally
would
be
favorable
to
exports
as
against
imports,
the
ad
valorem
method,
for
reasons
that
senator
hatfield
explained,
that
could
be
defensible
under
these
agreements,
but
to
charge
user
fees
to
imports
and
not
to
exports
in
these
same
harbors
could
be
a
basis
for
objections
and
retaliation
by
our
trading
partners
as
a
disguised
form
of
raising
our
tariffs
again,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no,
we
really
meant
that
in
context
only
for
exporters,
but
there
is...
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
this
would
not
be
severable,
but
the
concern
about
possible
retaliation
by
our
trading
partners
in
saying
that
we've
in
disguise
raised
our
tariff
rates
again
and
so
they're
going
to
raise
theirs,
that
would
not
only
affect
the
public
interest
in
our
balance
of
trades,
but
it
would
directly
affect
exporters
from
this
country.
it
would
be
something
that
would
burden
exports
from
this
country.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
i'm
talking
about
retaliation
by
our
trading
partners.
if
they
then
raise
their
tariffs,
that
makes
it
harder
for
industries
in
this
country
that
wish
to
export
to
be
able
to
export.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
wouldn't
go
so
far
as
to
say
we're
necessarily
in
violations,
although
a
foreign
country,
one
of
our
trading
partners
might
make
such
a
claim
before
the
world
trade
organization,
but
they
also
could
use
this
as
a
reason
to
impose
retaliatory
measures.
congress
was
faced
with
a
very
complex
problem
here.
the
constitution
is
designed
for
modern
commerce
as
well
as
for
the
commerce
that
was
known
at
the
time
that
these
provisions
were
adopted,
and
we
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
right
in
pointing
to
this
court's
user
fee
jurisprudence
which
has
been
developed
in
detail
in
fields
other
than
the
export
clause
after
pace
v.
burgess.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
we
understand
that
from
the
ibm
case
if
this
were
a
tax,
and
that
is
why
we
are
arguing
that
this
is
a
permissible
user
fee,
which
is
one
of
the
arguments
we
had
made
right
along
in
the
case
and,
indeed,
had
always
been
our
principal
argument,
and
it
satisfies
the
basic
classic
attribute
of
a
user
fee
that
has
been
developed
in
many
aspects
of
the
court's
jurisprudence.
the
funds
are
all
impressed
into
a
trust.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
court
in
the
evansville-vanderburgh
case
did
say
that
it
seemed
to
the
court
in
that
context
to
make
no
difference
whether
it
was
assessed
on
the
airline
or
on
the
passenger,
because
it
came
down
to
the
same
thing.
the
costs
were
to
be
passed
along
to
the
passenger.
there
was
a
very
practical
reason
for
asking
the
shippers
to
be
the
ones
to
make
the
payment,
and
that
was
that
the
carrier
would
not
be
in
a
position...
once
congress
decided
that
the
ad
valorem
measure
was
the
only
equitable
one
that
they
could
hope
to
impose,
the
carriers
would
not
be
in
a
position
to
know
the
value
of
the
cargo.
and
one
of
the
principles
that
this
court
has
recognized
repeatedly
in
giving
legislative
latitude
in
the
crafting
of
user
fees
is
that
you
don't
want
to
add
administrative
expenses
that
will
make
the
fee
more
burdensome
and
more
onerous
for
everybody,
that
there
are
virtues
in
keeping
it
simple.
and
the
customs
service
is
there,
was
a
resource
that
could
be
drawn
upon
that
deals
not
with
the
carriers
but
with
the
owners
of
the
goods
with
the
shippers
one
way
or
the
other,
and
congress
tried
to
craft
this
in
a
manner
that
would
impose
the
least
burden
and
would
avoid
severe
economic
dislocations
in
the
country.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
enough
to
make
it
a
user
fee,
and
it's
a
permissible
user
fee.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
if
it...
that
would
have
much
more
difficulty
meeting
this
court's
criteria
for
what
is
a
valid
user
fee.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
are
the
three-part
criteria,
including
that
it
must
not
be
excessive
in
relation
to
the
cost
to
the
government
of
providing
the
benefits
that
are
accorded--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--to
those
contributors.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
you
know,
that
is...
an
ad
valorem
system,
any
system
is
going
to
have
some
applications
that
could
be
improved
upon
in
a
more
utopian
scheme,
but
congress
reasonably
concluded
that
those
whose
cargo
in
the
aggregate
was
more
valuable
were
getting
greater
benefits
in
terms
of
enhancement
of
value
from
the
improvement
in
facilities
that
was
being
provided
in
order
to
promote
their
commerce,
the
commerce
of
the
users.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
three-part
test
has
to
be
met.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
three-part
test
does
have
to
be
met
that
this
court
specified
in
the
massachusetts
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we
recognize
that,
except
for
the
route
in
pace
v.
burgess.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
true,
but
ad
valorem
taxes
have
been
upheld
as
user
fees--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
sperry
and
in
capital
greyhound
lines
referred
to
in
evansville-vanderburgh
in
the
discussion
of
capital
greyhound
lines
as
one
permissible
approach.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
so
those
are
three
decisions
of
this
court
that
have
recognized
that
as
a
basis
for
user
fees--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--in
a
proper
context.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no.
these
have
been
the
main
feature
that
awaited
the
decision
in
ibm,
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
ibm
briefing
itself,
that
these
cases
were
pending
as
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
decision
was
needed
in
that
case,
and
then
the
arguments
were
adjusted
accordingly.
but
it
is
true
that
the
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
even
exporters
can
be
charged
fees
for
pilotage,
for
wharfage,
for
other
facilities
that
are
provided,
and
the
line
has
to
be
drawn
somewhere.
exporters
are
not
exempt
from
paying
their
own
way
in
commerce
the
same
as
other
users
of
the
facilities
of
commerce,
and
the
best
guidance
for
drawing
the
line
has
been
the
test
that
the
court
has
developed
in
protecting
all
constitutionally
protected
interests.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
if
itemization
requirements
are
carried
too
far,
and
you
get
into
an
example
for...
where
wharfage
capacity
has
been
increased,
does
that
mean
that
only
the
users
of
the
new
wharves
can
be
charged
user
fees?
if
the
channel
has
been
deepened
and
somebody
could
have
gotten
along
with
a
shallower
vessel
but
because
of
the
deepening
of
the
channel
had
to
use
the
larger
vessel,
does
he
have
to
bear
part
of
the
costs?
the
constitution
may
not
prohibit
congress
from
causing
serious
economic
dislocations
in
exercising
its
power,
but
the
court
should
be
hesitant
to
require
congress
to
cause
serious
economic
dislocations
by
not
allowing
it
the
latitude
that
it
needs
in
fashioning
an
equitable
method
of
devising
user
fees.
yes,
congress
does
have
to
address
the
surplus
that
is
accumulating
in
this
fund,
but
all
of
the
account
is
impressed
for
operation
and
maintenance
of
the
harbors
and
for
no
other
purpose,
and
that...
and
those
funds
are
still
available
for
that.
congress
has
been
reluctant
to
expand
the
authorizations
to
noaa,
for
example,
or
to
the
coast
guard,
because
the
more
aspects
of
navigation
are
brought
under
this
fund
while
litigation
is
pending,
the
more
it's
argued
that
these
are
general
expenditures.
