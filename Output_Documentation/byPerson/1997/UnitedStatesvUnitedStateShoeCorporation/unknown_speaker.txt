unknown
speaker
sort
of
similar
to
the
last
case,
isn't
it,
trying...
finding
someone
else
to
pay.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
can
you
tell
us--
unknown
speaker
--does
the
record
show,
or
are
there
statistics
that
we
can
examine
to
determine
how
much
of
this
tax
is
paid
by
people
who
are
exporting
in
contrast
to
those
who
are
just
shipping
from
point
to
point
in
the
united
states?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
one
would
have
thought
that
if
all
this
attention
was
devoted
to
user
fees
the
enactment
wouldn't
have
been
called
a
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
also
this
thing
is
based
on
the
value
of
the
goods
exported,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
you
have
a
little
package
of
computer
chips
this
big
that
takes
no
space
in
the
ship
at
all,
and
it's
going
to
result
in
a
huge
tax,
but
a
big
quantity
of
wheat,
that
actually
does
require
a
large
ship
to
convey
it
and
so
forth,
might
pay
substantially
less.
unknown
speaker
the
value
might
be
less.
it's
kind
of
an
odd
sort
of
a
user
fee,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
how
would
a
statement
like
that
bear
on
whether
or
not
this
is
a
violation
of
the
export
clause?
unknown
speaker
i
think
if
you'd
had
20
wizards
sitting
down
and
coming
up
with
the
best
possible
solution
in
their
view
to
these
sort
of...
if
it
violated
the
export
clause
it's
still
bad,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're
talking
about
a
user
fee
of
harbors.
you'd
think
that
would
have
something
to
do
with
the
ships
and
the
tonnage
that's
required
and
how
deep
the
harbor
needs
to
be
and
how
big
the
dock
has
to
be,
and
that
turns
on
how
large
the
ship
needs
to
be,
and
this
doesn't
bear
any
relation
to
that.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
you've
piqued
my
curiosity.
why
don't
you
read
us
that
material
you
wanted
to
tell
us
about.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
put
it
in
for
what
it's
worth,
mr.
wallace.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
what
state
was
senator
hatfield
from?
unknown
speaker
a
lot
of
timber.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
doesn't
his
statement
boil
down
to
saying
that
a
fee
which
is
a
real
user
fee
is
going
to
have
an
economic
impact
that
we
don't
want.
isn't
that
what
it
boils
down
to?
unknown
speaker
it's
a
measure
of
use,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
closer
to
being
a
measure
of
use
than
value?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
guess--
--and
if
they
pay
for
it
out
of
the...
suppose
they
pay
for
it
out
of
the
highway
trust
fund.
it's
part
of
transportation.
is
the
gas
tax
now...
it's
really
a
user
fee.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
guess...
all
your
arguments
would
say,
we
don't
even
have
a
gas
tax.
we
have
a
highway
user
fee,
is
that
right,
even
though
they
call
it
a
gas
tax.
unknown
speaker
so
if
we
accept
your
argument
there
is
no
gas
tax.
it's
really
a
highway
user
fee
and
if,
in
fact,
they
decided
to
pay
for
the
ports
out
of
the
highway
trust
fund,
then
the
whole
thing's
a
highway
user
fee.
maybe
it's
an
income
user
fee,
a
facilities
user
fee,
income
tax
is
really
a
user
fee
for
using
the
country's
facilities.
[laughter]
how
do
you
draw
the
line?
unknown
speaker
we
can
get
rid
of
all
the
disadvantage
to
exports
by
putting
the
whole
thing
in
the
income
tax.
that
doesn't
make
the
income
tax
a
user
fee.
maybe
it
does.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i
thought
that
when
we
made
an
exception
from
the
constitutional
prohibition
of
federal
taxes
on
exports,
when
we
enunciated
an
exception
for
user
fees,
i
didn't
think
that
meant
any
charge
imposed
on
users.
i...
that
would
make
it
no
limitation
at
all.
so
long
as
you
impose
the
tax
through
users,
you
can
tax
exports
as
much
as
you
like.
if
that
limitation
is
to
have
any
bounds
at
all,
it
seems
to
me
we
must
mean
by
user
fee
a
charge
that
is
based
upon
the
degree
of
use
of
the
port.
unknown
speaker
not
in
the
export
clause
field.
in
other...
you're
referring
to
cases
that
deal
with
other
provisions
of
the
constitution,
not
the
export
clause.
unknown
speaker
and
in
pace
the
court
was
at
pains
to
point
out
that
the
charge
there
was
not
an
ad
valorem
charge.
unknown
speaker
not
under
the
export
clause.
unknown
speaker
but
constitutional
objections
may
be
quite
different
in
different
cases.
we
have
here
a
very
specific
prohibition,
and
the...
you
know,
the
pace
case,
the
fairbank
case
deal
with
those
particular...
that
particular
clause.
i'm
surprised
you...
perhaps
it's
our
fault
that
you
haven't
been
able
to
get
to
those
cases
yet,
but--
unknown
speaker
--we
know
the
congress--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
we
know
that
congress
gave
its
all
on
this
thing,
but
now
let's
look
at
the
law.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
is
that
why
you
suggested
that
maybe
this...
if
we
ruled
against
you
the
whole
thing
would
fall?
that
sort
of
surprised
me.
in
page
18,
footnote
8
of
your
brief
you
say
that
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
stands,
that
would
effectively
abolish
the
trust
fund.
it
would
void
the
harbor
maintenance
tax
in
its
entirety,
and
i
had
been
thinking
up
till
now,
well,
no,
it
would
only
excise
the
export
feature
of
it,
and
now
you're
suggesting
well,
maybe
the
import
would
also
fall?
unknown
speaker
but
it
would
be
applied
to
them
the
same
way
it
would
apply
to
shipping,
say,
from
new
york
to
texas?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
take
it
it's
more
serious
than
that.
if
we
strike
down
the
export
provision
and
require
refunds,
but
the
importers
can't
get
any
refunds,
then
we're
in
violations
of
the
agreement.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
a
provision
is
under
alternative
1
a
tax
on
imports
and
exports,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
that
makes
it
any
more
or
any
less
a
user
fee
under
any
other
alternative.
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
you're...
i
understand
the
problem
the
congress
was
faced
with.
it
can't
tax
imports...
exports.
that
doesn't
mean
that
if
it
taxes
imports
and
exports
it's
no
longer
an
export
tax.
it's
still
the
same
thing.
it's
still
an
export
tax.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
it
were
imposed,
let's
say,
on
the
ship...
the
ships,
the
owners
of
the
ships
or
the
vessels,
and
a
charge
for
using
the
docks
or
the
harbor,
which
the
vessel
owners
could
then
pass
on
in
the
form
of
costs
to
the
users
of
their
vessels,
i
think
you'd
have
a
good
argument
that
it's
a
user
fee,
but
the
nature
of
this
makes
it
awfully
hard
to
see
it
as
a
user
fee.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
can
i
ask
you,
do
we
have
a
definition
of
user
fee?
it
seems
to
me
your
argument
is
that
as
long
as
the
fee
is
paid
by
users
and
the
money
is
used
for
the
purpose
of
improving
ports,
that's
enough.
unknown
speaker
but
is
that...
is...
do
i
correctly
state
your
position,
and
if
that's
true,
could
you
impose
a
10-percent
tax
on
the
income
of
every
user
and
then
put
it
in
this
fund?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--oh,
but
of
course--
unknown
speaker
--then
don't
you
bump
into
justice
o'connor's
position
that
if
some
particularly
valuable
shipment
is
sent
the
cost
for
that
particular
shipment
is
really
excessive
in
terms
of
the
use
that
is
gotten
for
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
tell
me
why
it
is
not
true
that
any
definition
of
user
fee,
which
simply
defines
it
as
a...
you
know,
a
fee
imposed
on
users,
and
which
does
not
limit
it
to
the
cost
that
is
incurred
by
the
facilities
in
providing
the
use,
any
such
definition
will
be
totally
ineffective
in
preventing
the
taxation
of
exports,
because
you
could
always...
i
mean,
it
comes
to
the
same.
you
call
it
a
user
fee
and
impose
an
ad
valorem
tax,
which
is
what
has
happened
here.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
they
didn't
even
call
it
a
user
fee.
they
called
it
a
tax.
unknown
speaker
which
wasn't
an
export
tax.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
none
of
your
examples
of
user
fees
which
were
upheld
have
come
from
the
prohibition
against
a
tax
on
exports.
unknown
speaker
and
pace
v.
burgess,
as
i
say,
pointed
out
expressly
in
the
court's
reasoning,
one
of
the
reasons
they
upheld
it,
it
was
not
an
ad
valorem
tax.
unknown
speaker
--export
tax.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
wallace--
unknown
speaker
--this
was
in
the
pipeline
when
ibm
was
decided,
so...
and
my
question
is,
is
there
anything
else
in
the
wake
of
the
ibm
decision
that's
in
the
lower
courts
now
that
we
might
want
to
take
account
of
as
we
decide
this
case?
unknown
speaker
very
well,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
atwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
that
would
translate
into
a
tax,
then,
on
imports
only,
and
i
think
would
raise
serious
discrimination
problems
under
trade
agreements.
unknown
speaker
in
fact,
i
guess
the
fund
has
quite
a
surplus
in
it.
unknown
speaker
that
money
isn't...
it's
just
not
lying
there.
i
assume
the
government
is
using
it
for
other
purposes,
meanwhile.
unknown
speaker
the
way
it
uses
taxes...
the
way
it
generally
uses
tax
money.
unknown
speaker
there's
enough
in
there
to
pay
for
the
coal
miners
and
their
dependents?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
mr.
atwood,
before
you
do
that,
may
i
ask
if
you
would
tell
us
what
you
think
are
the
essential
components
of
what
one
could
legitimately
call
a
user
fee,
because
i
think
you
told
us,
you're
not
arguing
the
export
clause
rules
out
user's
fees,
but
it
has
to
be
legitimate.
unknown
speaker
and
mr.
wallace,
if
i
understood
him
right,
said,
well,
it's
a
tax
on
a
user
and
it
has
to
meet
those
three
standards.
unknown
speaker
for
the
cost
of
that
service.
unknown
speaker
do
the
costs
here
include
fixed
costs
for
dredging
the
harbor
originally?
is
it
all
maintenance,
or
is
it--
unknown
speaker
--well,
there
is
a
tradition...
there
is
a
tradition
of
something
called
value
of
service
pricing,
where
you
charge
somebody
for
the
fixed
cost
in
relationship
to
the
value
of
the
commodity
that
uses
the
service.
that's...
the
icc
did
that
for
years,
and--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
know
whether
that
makes
it
a
great
thing,
but
there
is
that
tradition.
unknown
speaker
well,
nobody
would
have
thought
icc
railroad
freight
car
rates
were
taxes.
they
would
have
said
that
those
are...
that's
simply
a
way
of
pricing
the
railroad
line
and,
indeed,
they
have
it
in
the
telephone
service
business
right
now,
where
you
pay
lower
cost
of
residency,
and...
i
mean,
there
are
all
kinds
of
things
like
that
where
fixed
costs
are
divided
in
relationship
to
the
value
of
the
service
rather
than
the
cost
of
the
service
to
the
person
who's
using
it.
unknown
speaker
is
this
imposed
on
vessels
or
goods?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
what
your
answer
was
to
justice
breyer's
question.
there
are
many
ways
of
allocating
costs.
in
justice
o'connor's
example,
i
suppose
a
valuable
shipment
needs
some
extra
security
guards
and
a
safe
warehouse
facility.
maybe
that's
included
in
the
act.
it
seems
to
me
that
ad
valorem
is
certainly
the
simplest
way
to
measure
the
benefit
that
the
person
is
getting.
now,
maybe
that's
not
a
use
tax.
are
you
saying
that
a
use
tax
can
never
be
measured
by
the
benefit
that
the
user
derives?
unknown
speaker
that
argument
runs
into
justice
breyer's
point.
i
mean,
we've
considered
it
rational
enough
for
regulatory
pricing.
you
know,
value-of-service
pricing
has
been
common,
and
we've
never
thought
it
was
irrational.
and
even
if
you--
--it's
rational
enough.
i
think
your
point
has
to
be
that
it's
simply
not
compatible
with
any
limitation
on
the
taxation
of
exports,
because
once
you
go
to
ad...
it
comes
to
the
same.
except
that
if
you
relate
it
to
costs...
say
you're
putting
in
a
new
lighthouse
at
the
harbor
entrance,
which
would
benefit
everybody
who
uses
it,
and
if
the
total
amount
collected
doesn't
exceed
the
cost
of
the
lighthouse,
doesn't
that
satisfy
your
cost
test?
unknown
speaker
correct.
unknown
speaker
and
say...
and
it's
measured
by
those
who
use
it,
by
the
value
of
the
goods
shipped.
unknown
speaker
well,
your
ceiling--
unknown
speaker
--number
of
calls
on
the
port.
unknown
speaker
there
was
a
jurisdiction
point.
do
i
understand
correctly,
if
it...
if
the
cit
is
the
right
place
the
cases
that
were
started
in...
what
is
the
proper
title
now,
the
cfc?
could
be
transferred
under
1631
and
that
would
take
care
of
the
statute
of
limitations?
unknown
speaker
because
you
started
out
on
the
cit--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
take
any
position
on
that?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
atwood.
mr.
wallace,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
