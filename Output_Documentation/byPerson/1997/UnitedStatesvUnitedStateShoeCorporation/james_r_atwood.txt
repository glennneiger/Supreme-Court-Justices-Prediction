mr.
james
r.
atwood
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
i'd
like
to
supplement
the
answer
to
justice
kennedy's
question
about
what
data
is
in
the
record.
also
in
the
appendix
at
page
97
is
some
more
updated
material
about
the
relative
charge
on
exports
and
imports
in
domestic
commerce,
and
in
the
amicus
brief
of
the
aluminum
company
of
america
they
had
the
most
recent,
1997
data.
basically
it
tells
the
same
story,
and
that
is
that
exports
have
paid
between
25
and
30
percent
of
this
tax
over
the
years,
and
the
amount
that
the
exports
now
pay
is
less
than
the
annual
surpluses
accumulated,
so
you
could
eliminate
exports
entirely
from
this
tax
and
there
would
still
be
more
revenue
coming
in
than
the
government
is
spending
on
harbor
maintenance.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
this...
if
there
is
an
international
issue
there,
it
can
be
solved
in
the
same
way
the
export
problems
can
be
solved,
which
is
to
make
this
a
legitimate
user
fee.
i
think
the
foreign
governments
are
concerned
by
the
fact
that
they
thought
they
had
negotiated
ad
valorem
duties
of
a
certain
level
and
now
the
united
states
is
imposing
ad
valorem
charges
on
top
of
that,
and
that's
the
problem
internationally,
if
there
is
one,
so
a
valid
user
fee
approach
here
i
think
would
solve
both
the
export
problem
and
the
import
problem.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
it
has
more
than
a
billion
dollars
and
is
expected
to
hit
$3
billion
in
just
a
few
more
fiscal
years.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
exactly.
that
is
one
of
our--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--that
is
one
of
our
objections
to
this
user
fee
classification.
the
harbor
maintenance
trust
fund
is
simply
an
accounting
entry.
revenues
under
this
tax
are
treated
as
on-budget,
so
that
every
dollar
that
comes
in
offsets
obligations
to
raise
taxes
for
discretionary
spending
under
the
budget
control
process.
there
is
a
transfer
to
the
trust
fund
which
is
a
nonevent
for
budget
purposes.
it's
simply
an
accounting
entry,
and
then
any
expenditures
actually
made
for
harbor
maintenance--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--any
appropriation
for
harbor
maintenance
has
to
follow
the
same
process
as
if
there
were
no
trust
fund.
there
has
to
be
a
bill
from
both
houses
of
congress
signed
by
the
president
and
congress
is
free
to
appropriate
as
much
or
as
little
money
as
it
would
like
for
harbor
maintenance,
irrespective
of
what's
in
the
trust
fund.
i'd
like
to
address
the
government's
argument
that
mr.
wallace
started
with
that
the...
this
tax...
and
i
hope
i
can
call
it
a
tax,
because
that's
what
congress
called
it...
was
a
result
of
a
very
complex,
delicate
legislative
process
and
important
compromises
were
made
and
sophisticated
judgments
as
to
what
was
possible
and
what
wasn't
possible.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
right.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
we
are
not
arguing
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
legitimate
user
fee.
in
the
context
of
the
export
clause
at
least,
because
of
history,
because
of
the
unqualified
nature
of
it,
because
of
this
court's
precedents,
we
think
the
class
of
user
fees
has
to
be
defined
strictly
and
narrowly.
there
must
be
a
demonstrable
service
provided
to
the
exporter
on
that
export
shipment,
an
identifiable
government
service
that
is
being
provided
to
the
exporter,
and
the
charge
must
bear
a
very
close
relationship
to
that
service,
particularly
where
a
fee
is
compulsory
in
nature.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
for
the
cost
of
that
service,
exactly.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
no.
capital
costs--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--i
think
the--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--once
you're
getting
into
value
of
service
i
think
that
is
crossing
the
line
into
a
tax.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
well,
in
deciding
this
case,
this
court
need
not
anticipate
every
possible
cost
theory
that
might
be
advanced,
but
an
ad
valorem
tax
based
on
a
nation-wide
program,
an
infrastructure
program,
is
about
as
far
from
costs
as
is
possible,
and
it
is
feasible,
i
think,
for
the...
for
congress
to
have
come
up
with
a
much
more
sophisticated
targeted
user
fee,
and
that
is
proven
by,
in
the
very
same
legislative
package
that
included
the
harbor
maintenance
tax,
there
was
the
harbor
development
tax,
which
was
the
state
analogue.
under
the
import-export
clause
congress
has
authority
to,
notwithstanding
the
import-export
clause
prohibition,
has
authority
to
authorize
state
charges
of
various
sorts,
and
the
same
legislation
included
the
harbor
development
tax,
which
is...
the
key
provisions
are
in
the
appendix
to
our
brief,
where
congress
said,
okay,
states
can
impose
harbor
dues,
notwithstanding
the
import-export
clause,
but
they
have
to
be
on
a
project-specific
basis,
they
have
to...
there
has
to
be
an
identifiable
project,
they
may
not
impose
the
dues
until
the
project
is
up
and
running
and
providing
services
to
the
shippers,
exporters
or
importers,
the
costs
have
to
be
limited...
the
fees
have
to
be
limited
to
the
cost
of
the
project,
and
you
have
to
discriminate
between
which
vessels
are
actually
using
the
project
and
which
are
not.
this
is
in
the
same
statute
that
included
the
harbor
maintenance
tax.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
that
is
not
specified
in
the
statute.
it
says
the
local...
the
states
and
municipalities
can
consider
either
approach,
but
they
may
not
impose
charges
if
the
vessel
is
of
a
type
that
would
not
have
benefited
from
that
project.
for
example,
a
shallow
draft
vessel,
regardless
of
what
it's
carrying,
may
not
be
charged
for
deep
dredging
when
it
did
not
need
the
deep
dredging,
so
it's
an
example
of
an
approach
that
is
obviously
far
closer
to
a
justifiable
user
fee,
and
it
was
in
this
very
legislative
package.
it
can
be
done.
you
know,
also,
as
the
quotations
that
mr.
wallace
gave
us
indicate,
this
was
a
difficult
political
process,
to
be
sure.
the
framers
were
worried
about
how
exports
would
survive
in
the
political
process.
that's
why
we
have
an
export
clause.
this
is
clear
from
the
constitutional
debates.
there
was
concern
that,
if
you
left
these
matters
to
congress,
that
in
the
give-and-take
of
the
political
process
exports
would
not
come
out
favorably,
so,
instead
of
waiting
for
congress
to
include
exemptions
in
statutes,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
exemptions
in
this
statute,
congress...
the
framers
put
the
exemption
in
the
constitution
itself,
and
that
exemption
is
not
being
honored
here.
there
is
a
long
tradition
under
the
export
clause
of
broad
liberal
construction.
the
court
has
said
that
in
fairbank,
it
said
it
most
recently
in
ibm,
it
said
it
in
a.
g.
spalding,
and
the
broad
construction
to
which
the
export
clause
is
supposed
to
be
given
would
be
completely
undermined
here
by
an
ad
valorem
tax.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
i
believe
a
proper
user
fee
should
be
framed
in
terms
of
the
cost
of
the
benefit
and
not
the
benefit.
the
examples
you
gave,
first
of
all,
don't
involve
federal
services.
the
federal
government
does
not
provide
any
marshalls
at
ports.
that's
separate
altogether.
and
the
lower
courts,
i
think
they
both
considered
this
question
of
whether
ad
valorem
is
a
reasonable
measure,
even
of
benefit.
they
gave
the
government
the
benefit
of
the
doubt
and
said,
even
if
we
analyze
this
on
the
basis
of
benefits,
ad
valorem
is
irrational,
because
benefits
have
to
do
with
the
profitability
of
the
shipment,
not
its
total
value
or--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--a
port-specific
charge
for
a
lighthouse.
mr.
james
r.
atwood
that
would...
sounds
to
me
like
a
proper
user
fee,
although
i
still
wonder--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--i
would
think
the
proper
approach
is
not
to
measure
it
by
value
but
to
measure
it
by--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--numbers
of
passages
past
the
lighthouse,
or
some--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--number
of
calls
at
the
port,
exactly,
and
that's
how
state
taxes
are
often
allocated
between
ports.
you
measure
relative
port
days.
ad
valorem
really
just
slides
you
right
into
wealth
transfers
and
taxing
of
value,
and
particularly
so
when
you
do
it
on
a
nation-wide
basis,
where
the
costs
of
dredging
in
oregon
are
paid
for
by
shippers
on
the
east
coast.
so
i...
and
given
the
history
of
this
clause
and
the
purpose
for
which
it
was
intended
to
be
there,
which
is
to
protect
exports
from
the
vagaries
of
the
political
process,
i
think
it
does
require
a
broad
construction.
if
there
are
no--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--that
doesn't
affect
my
client--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--so
we
do
not
take
a
position
on
the--
mr.
james
r.
atwood
--on
the
transferability
of
cases
from
that
other
court,
because
in
this
case
it's
clear
that
the
cit...
conceded
by
both
sides
the
cit
and
the
federal
circuit
had
jurisdiction.
