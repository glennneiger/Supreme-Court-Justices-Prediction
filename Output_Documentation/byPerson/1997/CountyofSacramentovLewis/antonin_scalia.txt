justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
am
i
supposed
to
do?
i
mean,
you
give
me
two
options,
that
it's
a
substantive
due
process
violation
if
it's...
if
it
shocks
the
conscience,
or
if
it's
grossly
negligent
conduct.
what
if
i
think
none
of
the
above?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
i
pick
grossly
negligent
conduct
because
that's
the
closest
to
not
having
a
substantive
due
process
violation
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
certainly
thought
that's
what
this
case
was
about
when
i
first
read
about
its
facts.
i
mean,
we've
had
a
number
of
cases
involving
police
chases
and
they
always
come
up
as
unreasonable
seizure
cases.
justice
antonin
scalia
lo
and
behold,
i
read
this
thing
and
it's
somehow
a
substantive
due
process
violation
put
in
a
whole
different
category
of
constitutional
analysis,
and
the
city
just
goes
along
with
that.
is
there
any
case
on
record
in
which
somebody
has
asserted
that
something
like
this...
a
court
has
held
that
something
of
this
sort
is
a
substantive
due
process
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
certainly
nothing
in
this
court
has.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
certainly...
you
know,
you
cannot
expand
the
first
amendment,
for
example,
by
saying,
well,
this
doesn't
violate
any
of
our
first
amendment
law,
however,
we
think
this
was
a
deprivation
of
liberty
under
the
due
process
clause,
apart
from
the
first
amendment.
we
wouldn't
hear
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
should
we
do
it
for
the
fourth?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wasn't
this
case
disposed
of
on
the
basis
of
qualified
immunity?
i
think
our
cases
have
said
that
the
courts
should
make
that
inquiry
first
before
they
move
on
to
decide
the
constitutional
questions,
and
even
if
this
is
a
substantive
due
process
violation,
it's
surely
a
brand
new
one,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
case
under
substantive
due
process
in
which
the
deprivation
in
question
was
negligent,
or
even
grossly
negligent?
justice
antonin
scalia
or
even
shocking
the
conscience
but
not
intentional?
justice
antonin
scalia
under
the
substantive
due
process
clause.
under
the
due
process
clause,
which
we
have
interpreted
to
be
a
substantive
clause.
justice
antonin
scalia
your
argument
concedes
that
if
it
shocks
the
conscience
it
doesn't
matter
if
the
officer
did
not
intend
to
deprive
this
individual
of
his
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
of
any
other
substantive
due
process
cases
where
there
has
been
a
negligent,
even
grossly
negligent
deprivation
of
life
that
was
held
to
violate
substantive
due
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
make
the
argument
anywhere,
and
i...
you
know,
i
was--
justice
antonin
scalia
--surprised
not
to
see
it
made.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
sort
of
begs
the
question
to
call
this
lethal
force.
when
you
say
lethal
force,
you...
that
indicates,
you
know,
intentionally
trying
to
kill
the
person.
that's
not
in
this
case
at
all,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
at
most
an
irresponsibly
speedy
chase.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
there
any
indication
that
there
was
an
intent
to
kill
anybody,
to
apply
lethal
force?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
the
case
you
shouldn't
worry
about
the
shocks-the-conscience
standard,
then.
if
you
have
a
case
where
a
policeman,
you
know,
just
revved
up
and
drove
right
into
somebody,
why
should
you
worry
about
shocks
the
conscience?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
certainly
shocks
my
conscience.
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
he
wished
that,
and
he
wasn't
exactly
an
innocent
bystander.
i
mean,
he
was
riding
on
a
motor
cycle
in
violation
of
his
parole,
the
motor
cycle
being
driven
by
someone
whom
he
had
been
told,
as
a
condition
of
his
parole,
to
stay
away
from.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
there
was
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
reason
they
were
both
fleeing
was
that
they
were...
if
found
together
were
in
violation
of
their
parole
for
grand
theft
auto
on
some
other
occasion.
justice
antonin
scalia
joy-riding.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
whatever.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
realize
that
the
police,
when
they
turned
the
lights
on,
were
trying
to
stop
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how...
which
was
necessary
to
catch
up
to
the
motor
cycle.
how
fast
was
the
motor
cycle
going?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
idea
how
many
dangerous
felons
have
been
captured
in
high
speed
chases
who
would
have
killed
more
than
383
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
all
a
cost-benefits
analysis,
isn't
it,
and
i
guess
if
the...
you
know...
you
can't
really--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know,
i'd
be
sympathetic
if
your
client
were
a
bystander,
but
it
takes
two
to
make
a
chase,
and
your--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
he
was
not
driving.
he
was
sitting
right
behind
the
fellow
that
was
driving.
there's
no
reason
to
believe
that
he
wasn't
happy
to
get
away
as
much
as
the
person
who
was
driving.
and
he
owned
the
motor
cycle,
didn't
he?
and
he
owned
the
motor
cycle.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
put
mr.
brian
willard
on
the
stand,
who
said...
who
said,
the
decedent
kept
yelling
in
my
ear,
please,
slow
down.
stop.
did
that
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
put
him
on
the
stand
and
that's
what
he
said?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
also
removes
any
question
of
whether
the
person
fleeing
didn't
know
he
was
fleeing
from
an
officer
trying
to
make
an
arrest.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
still
bears
upon
the
guilt
of
the
police
officer
whether
the
police
officer
reasonably
continued
the
chase.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
may
not
make
your
client
any
more
guilty,
but
it
certainly
makes
the
police
officer
more
reasonable
in
continuing
the
pursuit,
knowing
that
the
person
sees
the
police
lights,
hears
the
siren,
and
is
fleeing.
justice
antonin
scalia
gee,
i
hope
not.
i
have
voted
to
deny
certiorari
in
a
lot
of
cases
whose
analysis
i
don't
approve
of.
