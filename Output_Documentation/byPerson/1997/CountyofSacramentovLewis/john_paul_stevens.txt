justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
on
the
political
process,
is
it
correct
that
in
california
the
officers
are
immune
for
this
kind
of
conduct,
even
if
it's...
no
matter
how
gross?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
city
might
be
held
liable.
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
a
respondeat
superior
type
of
approach,
or--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--now,
in
this
case
did
the
plaintiff
sue
the
county,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
on
state
law
grounds?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
quick
question,
please,
before
you
sit
down?
i
wanted
to
get
back
to
this
case,
and
you
said
at
the
beginning
that
you
thought
if
it
were
a
fourth
amendment
case
there's
clearly
no
liability.
why
is
that?
why
isn't
an
attempted
seizure
subject
to
the
fourth
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you,
if
this
case
were
analyzed
under
the
fourth
amendment
rather
than
substantive
due
process,
what
do
you
think
a
proper
disposition
would
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
would
you
get
over
the
possible
hurdle
that
there
was
actually
no
seizure
here?
