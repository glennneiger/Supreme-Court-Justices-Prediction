justice
sandra
day
o'connor
may
i
ask
you
a
question
right
at
the
start,
please,
mr.
cassidy?
the
county
of
sacramento
apparently
takes
the
position
that
a
substantive
due
process
violation
does
arise
from
a
negligently
conducted
police
chase
of
someone.
i
mean,
you
don't
raise
the
question
whether
there
is
a
substantive
due
process
violation
at
all.
you
apparently
assume
there
is,
and
then
just
want
us
to
decide
what
standard
to
apply.
do
i
understand
correctly
that's
your
position
on
behalf
of
the
county?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
concede
that
on
the
facts
in
this
case,
the
police
pursuit
case
before
us,
that
the
only
inquiry
is
what
standard
to
apply,
because
there
would
be
a
substantive
due
process
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that's
not
the
position
taken
by
the
county.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
hedlund,
you
still
have,
i
guess,
unresolved
at
this
stage
state
law
claims--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--against
the
police
officer--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
the
county?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
was
a
summary
judgment
at
issue
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
what
we're
dealing
with.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
with
regard
to
the
section
1983
claims
only,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
any
event,
as
i
understand
the
situation,
you
have
remaining
for
disposition
in
the
lower
courts
claims
of
negligence
or
gross
negligence
against
the
officer
and
the--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
the
county.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
oh,
but
presumably
most
citizens
know
that
if
they
violate
the
traffic
laws
and
a
police
car
attempts
to
stop
them
they
should
stop
and
yield
to
the
authority.
i
mean,
most
of
us
understand
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
was
at
least
testimony
here
by
the
young
man
who
survived
that
the
decedent
kept
urging
him
to
flee.
