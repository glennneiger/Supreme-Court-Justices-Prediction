justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
couldn't
there...
so
i'm
thinking
about
it
possibly
a
little
differently,
some
things
that
you
say.
there
is
a
category
of
cases
where
government
officials
deprive
a
person
of
life.
they're
police
officers,
and
most,
but
not
all
of
those
fall
under
the
fourth
amendment.
that's
one
category.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there's
a
second
category
where
they
behave
in
ways
that
shock
the
conscience.
that's
a
second
category,
not
the
first.
then
there's
possibly
a
third
category
that
justice
ginsburg
mentioned
where
you
could
have
conduct,
perhaps
it's
rare,
but
someone
who's
not
a
policeman,
someone
who
doesn't
behave
in
a
way
that
shocks
the
conscience,
but
nonetheless
either
negligently,
recklessly,
or
intentionally
deprives
a
person
of
his
life.
now,
that
might
be
covered
by
the
fourteenth
amendment,
mightn't
it?
i
mean,
at
least
where
someone
intentionally
deprives
a
person
of
his
life.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
should
the
standard
be
there?
maybe
it
wasn't
a
policeman.
maybe
it
was
a
health
officer.
i
don't
know
who
it
was.
but
what
should
the
standard
be
in
that
third
category
of
cases?
would
you
say
it
never
violates
the
constitution
to
intentionally
deprive
a
person
of
his
life
without
justification?
would
you
say,
reckless?
would
you
say,
negligent?
does
it
depend
on
whether
the
state
provides
an
adequate
tort
remedy,
so
that
the
process
is
okay,
or
not
okay?
what's
the
standard
in
that
third
area?
that's
what
i'm
not
certain
about,
which
is
why
i
asked.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
even
if
a
person--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--even
if
a
health
officer,
for
example,
intentionally
murdered
somebody
under
color
of
law,
it
didn't
shock
the
conscience
but
it
was
awful,
it
doesn't
violate
the
constitution
even
if
the
state
provides
no
remedy?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you're
going
to
expand
the
shock-the-conscience
category.
i
mean,
that's
a
way
of
dealing
with
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
can
i
ask
you,
follow...
you
may
not
agree
with
what...
my
analysis,
but
assume
it
for
a
second.
assume
that
you
could
recover
under
the
fourth
amendment
were
it
not
for
the
problem
of
seizure--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--so
we're
not
talking
about
the
fourth
amendment.
i'll
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
you
could
prove
a
shock-the-conscience.
maybe
you
can,
maybe
you
can't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i'd
say
there
is
a
category
of
shock-the-conscience
behavior.
if
you
win
on
that
one,
fine,
but
i
don't
think
that's
what's
in
front
of
us.
i
think
what's
in
front
of
us
is
the
concern
with
a
middle
category
of
case--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--where
a
government
official,
deprives
a
person
of
his
life
and
the
constitution
says
you
can't.
now,
with
property,
i
think
this
court
said
in
parratt
that
you're
going
to
look
to
state
law
because
they
provide
the
procedure
that's
due.
all
right.
with
life,
maybe
it
makes
a
difference
whether
it's
intentional,
reckless,
or
negligent,
and
whether
the
state
provides
procedure
that's
due.
that's
what
i
want
to
know.
what's
the
procedure
that
you
get
here
under
state
law?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
that
is
to
say,
can
you
recover
from
the
municipality
here
under
state
law
so
that
your
client,
if
there
was
negligent
or
reckless
or
wrongful
behavior,
would
be
compensated?
does
state
law
permits
that
or
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
this
is...
as
you've
said,
it's
all
violating
your
standard,
and
so
forth.
is
there
any
reason...
assuming
your
facts
are
right,
is
there
any
reason
to
think
you
could
not
recover
against
the
state...
against
the
municipality
under
state
law,
assuming
your
facts
are
what
they
say,
are
what
you
just
said?
all
the
facts
are
just
as
you
said
them.
is
there
any
reason
to
think
that
state
law
would
not
give
you
a
tort
remedy
against
the
municipality,
or
against--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
believe
it
will.
all
right.
and
is
the...
fine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
chases,
if
you're
going
into
the
statistics,
they're
very
much
contested
in
these
briefs,
and
i'm
not
certain--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--one
of
the
briefs
of
the
municipalities
says
300
a
year
out
of
the
2.2
million
people--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
but
there
are
2.2
or
2.3
million
people
who
die.
it's
very
bad
that
there
are
3
or
400.
that's
terrible,
but
that's
not
enormous
in
terms
of
the
number
of
people
who
die
in
accidents.
that's
what
one
side
says,
and
i
guess
the
other
side
focuses
on
this,
and
i'm
not
sure
that
it's
directly
related,
is
it,
or
not,
in
your
opinion?
