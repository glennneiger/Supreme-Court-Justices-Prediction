justice
david
h.
souter
well,
do
you...
if
we
assume
for
the
sake
of
argument
that
this
is
properly
a
substantive
due
process
case
and
not
a
fourth
amendment
case,
are
we
supposed
to
take
the
case
on
the
assumption
that
on
at
least
one
of
the
two
alternative
standards
that
has
been
proposed
here
there
is
a
substantive
due
process
violation?
that
seems
to
be
the
assumption
of
the
state's
position,
but
i
may
be
wrong.
justice
david
h.
souter
so
it's
not
merely
a
question
of,
he
didn't
know
which.
we
may
assume
that
in
fact
it
would
be
findable
today
that
there
is
no
substantive
due
process
violation,
even
assuming
that
this
is
a
substantive
due
process
case.
justice
david
h.
souter
because
usually
we
don't
get
wrapped
around
problems
of
qualified
immunity
unless
we
are
at
least
assuming
that
now
there's
a
violation,
so
that's
why
i
want
to
know
whether
you
are
conceding
that
now,
on
at
least
one
of
these
standards,
there
would
be
a
substantive
due
process
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
we
do
it
if
we
first
conclude
that
it
is
not
arbitrary,
that
whatever
the
state
action
was
that
caused
the
injury
was
not
arbitrary
in
the
sense
of
just
being
beyond
the
realm
of
reason
as
something
the
state
might
choose
to
do,
or
a
governmental
actor
might
choose
to
do.
is
it
your
argument
here...
i
take
it
ultimately
it
is...
that
you
simply
cannot
say
that
a
high
speed
chase,
assuming
there
is
cause
to
apprehend
in
the
first
place,
is
so
totally
beyond
the
realm
of
reasonable
conduct
addressing
a
legitimate
governmental
object
as
ever
to
fall
within
that
arbitrary
character.
is
that
your
position?
justice
david
h.
souter
they
may
be
unwise,
but
they
are
not,
as
it
were,
so
totally
beyond
the
realm
of
reason
as
to
rise
to
the
level
of
a
substantive
due
process
violation.
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
those...
and
i...
i
know
i'm
mixing
apples
and
oranges
here,
but
how
do
you
distinguish
those,
your
position
there
from
the
analysis
that
occurs
in
an
unreasonable
force
situation
under
the
fourth
amendment?
why
is...
why
can
we
not
say,
let's
say
in
unreasonable
force
cases
that,
sure,
the
force
is
always
directed
to
the
consummation
of
a
legitimate
governmental
object,
which
is
the
apprehension
of
the
suspect,
or
the
person
for
whom
there
is
a
warrant.
why
don't
we
in
effect
dismiss
all
of
those
cases
on
the
same
analysis?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
would
it
be
fair
to
say
that
the
force
cases
are
all
cases
in
which
there
can
be,
or
could
have
been,
or
was
an
apprehension
in
the
first
place,
and
it's
clear
that
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
was
the
force
necessary
to
accomplish
the
object?
would
that
be
a
fair
characterization?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
in
this
case
it
isn't
correct
to
say
that
by
no
stretch
of
the
imagination
the
speed
was
unnecessary
to
catch
the
person.
is
that
the
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
there
can
never
be
a
lawful...
or,
there
can
never
be
a
high
speed
chase
consistent
either
with--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
there's
always
a
known
risk.
justice
david
h.
souter
if
you're
going
to
drive
that
fast
there's
a
known
risk,
and
presumably
you
disregard
it
when
you
make
the
chase,
so
how
do
you
distinguish
between
the
cases
in
which
there
would
be
recovery
and
those
in
which
there
would
not
be?
justice
david
h.
souter
what
should
the
line
be,
felony
misdemeanor?
lack
of
probable
cause?
probable
cause?
