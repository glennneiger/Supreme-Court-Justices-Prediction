mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
court
and
the
constitution
protect
fleeing
felons
from
lethal
force
except
in
certain
circumstances.
it
would
seem
that
this
court
and
the
constitution
would
do
the
same
for
people
who
only
commit
minor
traffic
infractions,
and
especially
for
innocent
trapped
passengers
like
philip
lewis.
furthermore,
it
is
submitted
that
it
should
not
be--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--the...
well,
i
think
in
this
case--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
actually,
when
you
look
at
the
end
of
the
accident
itself,
the
police
officer
during
his
deposition
will
not
even
concede
that
he
hit
the
individual,
that...
you'll
see
on
page,
i
think
it's
106
of
the
appendix,
that
here
is
an
individual
who
is
ejected,
or
stands
up
in
the
center
of
a
two-lane
highway.
how
in
the
world
can
the
officer,
who
has
200
feet
prior
to
impact,
hit
the
individual,
who's
in
the
center
of
a
two-lane
highway?
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well,
i
think--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--it
certainly
shocks
mine.
i
think
i
can
prevail
in
any
jury
on
any
test
this
court
wishes
to
present.
however,
i
think
that
the
test,
and
that
is
really
the
crucial
issue
that
was
presented
here
originally,
the
test...
and
i
think
this
case
is
properly
analyzed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
think
all
the
lower
courts
have
actually
analyzed
most
cases
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
oh,
yes,
and...
i
mean,
there
are
legions
of
cases,
and
some
of
them
use
shocks
the
conscience,
and
some
of
them
use
reckless
disregard.
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
i
think
it
connotes
reckless
intent,
which
is,
you
know--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
i
think
there
is...
that's
exactly
the
point
that's
presented
here,
and
i
would
like
to
make
one
more
point
when
i
say,
about
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
individual
who
is
killed
in
this
case
represents
almost
an
innocent
bystander,
because
he's
on
the
back
of
a
motor
cycle,
but
at
the
time
that
he
was
actually
killed
he
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
street,
because
he
had
stepped
off
the
motor
cycle.
it
had
stopped,
and
it
was
stopped
in
response
to--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--no,
i
disagree.
in
fact,
the
ninth
circuit
asked
me
specifically
what
i
thought
the
standard
would
be,
and
suggested
whether
i
thought
the
standard
should
be
gross
negligence,
and
i
said,
i
think
if
you
do
that
the
supreme
court
will
reverse
you
right
away.
i
don't
think
that
gross
negligence
today--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--reckless
disregard.
conscience
indifference.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--no,
the
person
didn't
gun
the
motor.
he
laid
down
166
feet--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--no,
no,
you
don't
coast
with
166
feet
of
four-wheel-lock
skid.
we
concede
that.
he
wished
he
got
out
of
the
way,
yes.
i
concede
that.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
right.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
it
was
joy-riding--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--for
philip
lewis.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
but
from
the
position
of
the
officer,
that...
there
was...
they
didn't
know
these
kids
at
all,
and
when
they
were
perceived
originally
they
were
walking
the
motor
cycle
between
the
two
police
cars.
the
officer
that
instituted
the
chase
didn't
even
know
if
the
lights
that
were
put
on
on
mr.
stapp's
automobile
were
intended
for
mr.
lewis,
or
for
mr.
brian
willard,
more
specifically,
because--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--there
is
no
indication
that
officer
smith,
who
did
this
incredibly
reckless
act,
even
knew
that
philip
lewis
or
brian
willard
saw
the
lights.
the
only
evidence
is
that
officer
stapp
saw
lights
go
on,
and
he
was
below
the
car,
and
at
an
angle.
he
was
faced
in
this
direction.
he
looked
over
his
shoulder.
the
boy...
the
boys
at
one
time,
he
says,
or
another,
looked
at
him
and
then
proceeded
off.
he
immediately
turned
his
car
in
a
three
point
turn
and
proceeded
out
at
a
high
rate
of
speed.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
at
that
point...
i
asked
him
specifically,
because,
he
said,
they
accelerated
away
quickly,
and
i
said,
what
does
that
mean,
you...
oh,
at
a
high
rate
of
speed,
he
said.
at
a
high
rate
of
speed,
they
went.
this
is
a
1976
honda
motor
cycle
that
had
just
been
worked
on
and
finally
fixed
so
it
could
even
run,
and
he
says,
well,
that
means
they
accelerated
quickly
to
the
speed
limit
and
then
beyond.
the
truth...
when
you
see,
as
i
have,
the
testimony
of
officer
smith,
everything
in
his
testimony
smacks
of
this
incredible
callous
indifference,
and
this
incredible
hostility
for
an
incident
that
was
really
created
beforehand
which,
he
came
out
of...
he
and
the
other
officer
came
out
of
a
house
dispute
which
was...
turned
nasty,
and
he
got
back
in
his
car...
stapp
himself,
all
he
heard
was
the
revving
of
a
motor
cycle.
he
assumed
that
the
revving
of
the
motor
cycle
meant
something,
perhaps
that
the
motor
cycle
was
going
fast.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well,
that's--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
i
actually
like
the
opinion
in
collins,
because
it
seems
to
me
to
indicate
that
collins
is
a
situation
in
which
the
court
is
willing,
if
the
conduct,
no
matter
what
it
is...
no
matter
what
it
is...
is
so
egregious
that
it
shocks
the
conscience,
that
means
to
say
that
i--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
collins--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i
am
defending
the
ninth
circuit
analysis.
i
thought
it
was
a
good
analysis,
and
an
appropriate
analysis.
i--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
i
think
they
just
determined
that
the
same
test
should
apply
for
municipal
liability
as
applies
for
the
underlying
violation.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
but
collins
is
a
particular
case
that
doesn't
present
the
issues
that
this
case
presents
at
all.
collins
is
a
way
of
getting
around
worker's
comp
statutes.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well,
i...
what
i
was
saying
is
that
collins
to
me,
reading
collins
indicated
that
when
you're
dealing
with
noncore
fundamental
issues
such
as
life,
and
here
it's
a
failure
to
train,
and
you're
dealing
with
nonspecifically
governmental
entities,
like
a
sanitation
department,
which
could
be
anything,
there
is
a
desire
not
to
expand
at
all
the
fourteenth
amendment
into
areas--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--no,
but--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--oh,
i
think
it
does,
and
it
should.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
i
don't...
to
me
the
collins
case
specifically
is...
says
that
this
is
not
the
kind
of
governmental
function
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
normally
designed
by
the
framers
to
protect
against,
but
in
our--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--so
is
it
the...
i--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i
don't
believe
that
the
analysis
in
collins
applies.
i
think
shocks-the-conscience
test
that
was
enunciated
in
collins
is
a
good
test
for
situations
which
are
outside
the
normal
purview
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
and
which
this
court
does
not
want
to
be
overridden
by
every
administrative
decision
that
occurs,
and
in
those
cases
i
think
it's
perfectly
appropriate,
and
i
applaud
the
court--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--absolutely.
that
is
the--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
high
speed
automobile
chases--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well--
[laughter]
and
carriage
chases
didn't
wreak
the
havoc
that
a
4,000-pound
automobile
doing
100
miles
an
hour
behind
some
kids,
when
the
police
officer
himself
says...
talk
about
shocks
the
conscience...
that
he
was
concerned
for
the
safety
of
the
passenger
because
the
passenger's
on
the
back
of
that
errant
motor
cycle
and
not
wearing
a
helmet.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
right.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
right.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well,
i--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i
don't
think
it's
as
easy
as
yes
or
no.
i
think
yes.
the
defendants
say
no.
they
still
say
no.
they
say,
and
i've
been
down
this
line
enough
times,
that
every
single
possible
immunity...
there's
one
that
says
fleeing
people
trying
to
evade
don't
have...
you
know,
that
an
officer
and
the
municipality
are
both
immune
from
that
liability,
and
then
they
try
to
say
that
the
person
on
the
back
of
the
motor
cycle
was
a
coconspirator
or
something
like
that,
had
some
agreement
that
he
was
going
to
continue.
actually,
in
fact,
the
agreement
here
was
that
mr.
lewis
asked
brian
willard
to
stop
and
pull
over
on
orangevale,
which
is
where
the
accident
happened.
now,
of
course,
what
will
happen
eventually
is
either
they
will
show
that
he's
either
participating
or,
when
we
get
to
the
negligence
claim,
if
we
ever
get
to
there,
they
will
say,
well,
then
he
was
partially
negligent
for
asking
him
to
stop
right
in
the
middle
of
the
road.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
yes.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
i
have
unresolved
all
claims.
i
have
never
had
a
trial.
i
have
never--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--right.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
right.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
no.
the
summary
judgment
went
to
the
state
claims,
too,
and
the
federal
judge
there
proceeded
to
knock
me
out
on
the
state
claims
to
the
extent
that
he
could
and
then
reserved
the
one--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--one
left.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
not
the
officer
any
more.
immunity
applied
to
him
completely.
but
to
the
county--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--yes.
otherwise
the
county
is
out
on
this.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well,
is
it
respondeat
superior
that
exempts
the
officer,
yes.
in
practicality
the
officer
is
exempted
anyway,
because
the--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
the...
no,
not
because
of
judgment-proof,
but
because
of
agreements
that
are
reached
between
the
entities
and
their
employees.
they
originally
request
insurance,
but
they
have
a
back-up
plan
and
they
indemnify
the
employee.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well,
i
think
i
would...
in
terms
of
disposition,
you
mean,
what
would
be
found?
i
think
i
would
win
hands-down,
objective
test
of
reasonable
force.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well,
that's
the
problem.
that's
why
it's
analyzed
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
it's
unfortunate,
but
the
truth
is
that
one-third
of
all
these
deaths...
which,
by
the
way,
are
occurring
one
a
day
in
high
speed
chases.
this
is
a
phenomenal
problem.
it
kills
exactly,
almost
to
the
individual...
in
1995,
383
people
each,
as
much
as
handguns
used
by
police,
so
it
is
the--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
there's
no
statistics.
it's...
you
know--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i...
you
know,
i
think,
though...
i
think
that
the
notion
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
that
there
are
certain
arbitrary
procedures.
when
you
pursue
someone
for
no
cause...
there
is...
without
sufficient
justification,
and
you
endanger
so
many
people's
lives,
going
over
a
blind
hill
at
night--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i
think--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i
think--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i
think
that
farmer
v.
brennan
is
a
good
standard,
that...
disregarding
a
known
risk.
i
think
that
that
is
enough
to
give
intent.
if
it
weren't
for
brower
i
think
that
we
would
agree
with
the
notion
of
an
analysis
under
the
fourth
amendment.
i
think
that--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--no.
i
think
that
one
has
to
balance--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--that's
true.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
is
it
justified?
is
there
some
compelling
reason?
you
know,
there
are
so
many
policy
questions
that
should
be
answered
here.
what
is
this
officer
going
to
do
when
he
catches
up?
what
can
you
do?
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
serious
felonies
you
can
engage
in
a...
the
same
as
firing
your
weapon.
i
don't
think
there's
really
any
difference.
i
think
this...
these
high
speed
chases
represent
exactly,
to
the
man,
the
same
problem
that
the
discharge
of
the
officer's
weapon,
except
to
use
the
military
phraseology
they
have
an
incredible
kill
radius.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
not
when
one's
driving
a
motor--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--he
owned
the
motor
cycle,
yes.
that
was
his
crime.
he
owned
the
motor
cycle.
he'd
owned
it
for
5
days.
he
fixed
it
up,
took
it
down
to
a
gas
station.
at
the
gas
station
was
mr.
brian
willard.
he
argued
with
mr.
brian
willard
not
to
go
on
the
bike,
but
he
said,
my
father
bought
it
for
me.
if
you're
going
to
take
it,
i
have
to
go
along
with
you.
my
father
will
kill
me
otherwise.
yes,
that--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--yes.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
that's
what
he
has
said.
he
did
not
say
that
in
his
deposition.
he
said
he
didn't
remember
that.
he
didn't
remember
being
asked
to
pull
over.
he
told
the
police
when
he
turned
himself
in.
you
know,
mr.
brian
willard
left
the
scene.
he
was
okay.
he
was
a
little
further
from
the
center
of
the
road
on
the...
in
the
oncoming
lane
the
other
side.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
i
believe
it
will.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
i've
always
believed
it
would.
you
know,
one
of
the
things,
40
percent...
40
percent
of
these
high
speed
police
chases--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--okay.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
okay.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
it's
now
400.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
well,
i
believe
that
it's
related
from
the
standpoint,
is
this
a
problem
that
rises
to
constitutional
dimensions,
and
i
think
the
court
should
consider
not
only...
if
this
were
an
isolated
event,
it
wouldn't
come
to
the
court's
attention.
it
wouldn't
be
fought
for
all
these
years
by
the
police
departments.
the
reason
they're
fighting
like
this
is
because
they
want
to
continue
this.
they
want
to
continue
to
take
the
lives
of
innocent--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--to
be
sure,
but--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--i
hope
that
doesn't
color
the
court's...
or
give
a
jaundiced
eye
towards
the
ninth
circuit.
i
think
the
ninth
circuit
correctly
determined
this.
i
think
it's
the
only
methodology
that
we
have,
and
this
court
has
available
to
it
in
a
single
sweep
to
announce
policy
that
will
make...
that
will
be
incorporated
into
policy
immediately,
that
will
make
these--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--no.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
all
you
have
to
do
is
say,
we're
not
talking
about
an
expansion
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
we're
talking
an
application
of
it.
this
is
exactly
what
the
fourteenth
amendment...
although
the
framers
didn't
know
about
cars
then
they
certainly
knew
about
arbitrary,
abusive,
oppressive
government
power,
and
there
can
be
no
more
core
government
function
that
affects
the
individuals
in
this
society
every
single
day
than
the
interface
that
occurs
exactly
out
on
the
streets
with
the
police
car
fully
lit
and
right
behind
you
showing
every
bit
of
color
of
law
that's
available,
and
that
color
of
law
is
depriving
innocent
people
of
their
lives
every
day
with
no
justification
whatsoever,
and--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well
now,
again,
that
brought
it
out
of,
you
know,
normal
perhaps
fourth
amendment
type
situations,
but--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
i
think
it
removes
any
question
of
whether
it's
under
color
of
law.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
yes.
the
person
fleeing
was
brian
willard,
the
driver
of
the
motor
cycle,
and
the--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--when
he...
when
he
saw--
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
--well,
the
problem
that
we
have
in
all
of
these,
and
one
of
the
things
that
we
see
constantly
in
the
petitioner's
briefs
and
the
amicus
briefs
on
his
behalf
is
that
there
is
a
justification
because
you
might
catch
other
people.
or
one
of
the
amicus
briefs,
he
even
goes
so
far
as
to
say
that
a
person
who
has
such
contempt
or
disregard
for
law
and
order
and
law
enforcement
officials,
that
the
removal
of
that
person
from
society
serves
a
valuable
function.
i...
you
know,
i
can't
imagine
the
kind
of
transgression
on
fundamental
constitutional
rights
that
is
envisioned
by
that
statement,
and
nor
can
i
envision
what
practical
result
is
going
to
occur
when
the
things
discovered
after
the
chase
actually
give
reason
for
the
chase
to
begin
with.
that's
like
saying
if
we
went
into
everyone's
homes
we
find
a
lot
of
people
have
done
crimes.
that's
not
what
this
country
is
about.
that's
not
what
the
constitution
is
about.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
that's
exactly
true.
most
of
us
understand
that
you
shouldn't
murder
someone,
but
the
problem
is
that
there
are
certain
situations,
most
of
the
time
murders,
and
most
of
the
time
fleeing
occurs
because
for
some
reason
or
another...
it's
a
kid,
it's
somebody
who
just
makes
a
decision
that's
irrational.
most
people
stop.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
there
was
a
statement,
not
kept,
but
that
the
decedent
said
at
one
point,
let's
get
out
of
here,
in
the
beginning,
contested.
mr.
paul
j.
hedlund
thank
you.
