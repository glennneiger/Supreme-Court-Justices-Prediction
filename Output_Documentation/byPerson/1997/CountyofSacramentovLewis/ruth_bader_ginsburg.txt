but
could
you
not
have
a
high
speed
chase
that
wouldn't
involve
the
fourth
amendment?
for
example,
think
back
to
the
days
of
the
freedom
riders.
suppose
there
had
been
state
police
involved
in
just
following
these
people
on
the
road
to
terrorize
them
for
mile
after
mile,
not
for
the
purpose
of
seizing
them
for
arrest,
but
to
frighten
them.
couldn't
that
be
an
appropriate
situation
for
a
due
process
rather
than
a
fourth
amendment
approach?
justice

how
about
an
individual
instance,
like
checki
itself?
would
you
agree
that
that
is
an
illustration
of
where
you
might
have...
where
you
have
conduct
that
is
shocking?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--and
yet
one
of
the
leading
cases
that
you
rely
on
didn't
show
color
of
law.
in
fact,
wasn't
that
one
of
the
problems
in
checki,
that
it
was
an
unmarked
vehicle,
that
this
police
vehicle
was
chasing
for
something
like
20
miles
without
any
indication
that
it
was
a
police
car?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
cassidy,
i
did
want
to
call
to
your
attention
one
thing.
you,
on
page...
is
it
20
of
your
brief
+/?
you
refer
to
the
decisions
of
evans
and
temkin,
and
you
say
that
this
court...
well,
you
tell
me
what...
you
said
the
court
had
implicitly
approved
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decisions
in
those
cases.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
is
a
denial
of
certiorari
an
implicit
approval
of
anything?
