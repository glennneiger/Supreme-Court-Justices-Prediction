mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
deputy
smith
is
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
in
this
case
on
the
grounds
that
the
law
regarding
substantive
due
process
claims
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
not
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
the
police
pursuit
in
this
case
in
may
of
1990.
in
that
regard,
the
legal
standard
was
not
sufficiently
well-developed,
nor
were
the
factual
contours
of
such
a
claim
developed
so
as
to
put
a
reasonable
officer
in
the
position
of
deputy
smith
on
notice
of
what
type
of
conduct
would
constitute
a
violation
of
substantive
due
process
in
the
context
of
a
police
pursuit.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
justice
o'connor,
no,
we
do
not
concede
that
a
negligent
claim
would
support
a
violation
of
substantive
due
process.
in
fact,
we
have--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--the
petitioners
in
this
case
have
asserted
that
the
proper
question
presented
is
whether
or
not...
what...
the
proper
legal
standard
to
be
applied
in
a
claim
for
substantive
due
process.
there
are
amici
briefs
which
have
asserted
that
no
claim
lies
in
this
case
because
of
the
accidental
nature
of
the
conduct
involved.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
upon
reflection,
i
would
agree
with
that
position
as
asserted
by
amici.
however,
it
had
not
been
asserted
in
the
lower
court
or
by
us
in
our
briefing.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
justice
scalia--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--well,
no,
your
honor.
we
would
respectfully
submit
that
in
the
event
this
court
determines
to
adopt
the
type
of
approach
it
did
in
albright
v.
oliver
and
determine
that
all
claims
perhaps
involving
a
seizure
fall
within
the
fourth
amendment
standards,
then
there
would
be
no
claim
available
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
and
i
would--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
believe
that
the
courts
of
appeal
have
analyzed
the
case
law
involving
police
pursuits
under
substantive
due
process
violations,
or
alleged
violations,
but
if
this
court
then
looks--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--correct,
and
if
this
court
were
to
look
at
the
recent
mays
opinion
out
of
the
seventh
circuit,
perhaps,
and
upon
reflection
by
petitioners
we
would
submit
that
that
may
be
the
correct
analysis.
if
only
the
fourth
amendment
were
to
apply
in
this
case,
then
there
would
be
no
violation
because,
in
fact,
the
means
that
were
used
to...
or
were
involved
in
this
accident
were
not
intentionally
applied,
so
there
was
no
seizure.
so
if
this
court
is
left
to
analyze
it
under
the
albright
analysis,
then
there
would
be
no
violation.
petitioner
would
prevail.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
upon
reflection,
petitioners
would
submit
that
it
should
not
be
so
expanded,
and
that
perhaps
the
analysis
by
this
court
in
deshaney
v.
winnebago
is
the
correct
analysis,
that
in
fact,
if
this
court
were
to
allow
the
claim
for
substantive
due
process
to
go
forward,
it
would
substantially
disrupt
the
political
process.
as
this
court's
noted
in
deshaney
as
well
as
in
the
recent
collins
decision
and
the
washington
v.
glucksberg,
the
political
process
is
extremely
important
to
allow
the
states
to
develop
the
appropriate
law.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
justice
ginsburg,
although
that
specific
type
of
circumstance
has
not
been
decided
by
this
court,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
checki
v.
webb
case
did
take
that
approach,
and
therein
lies
the
basis
for
the
analysis
that
potentially
there
could
be
such
a
claim.
however,
i
think
that
what
that
demonstrates
is
the
fact
that
in
the
context
of
qualified
immunity
deputy
smith
could
not
have
known,
as
a
reasonable
officer
in
the
field,
what
type
of
standards
should
be
applied
not
only
at
the
present
time
but
back
in
may
of
1990,
when
this
pursuit
occurred.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
no.
i
believe
there
was
no
violation
of
substantive
due
process,
regardless
of
which
standard
may
be
adopted
by
this
court.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
well,
1),
if
you
assume--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--no,
we
are
not.
if
the
court
determines
to
reach
the
issue
and
make
a
determination
as
to
what
the
proper
legal
standard
is,
petitioners
do
not
concede,
under
either
standard
that
has
been
posited,
that
in
fact
there
may
have
been
a
violation.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
that's
correct.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
well,
in
fact,
justice
scalia,
petitioners
would
heartily
agree,
and
in
fact
the
district
court
did
dispose
of
this
matter
on
behalf
of
deputy
smith
with
respect
to
the
qualified
immunity
issue,
and
we
believe
correctly
did
so.
we
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
rejects
this
court's
prior
teachings
in
harlow
and
malley
v.
briggs
and
determines
that,
under
this
very
gray
area
of
conduct
that
is
sufficiently
egregious,
that
somehow
an
officer,
in
the
context
of
the
rubric
of
the
fourteenth
amendment,
should
have
known
that
his
conduct
may
violate
a
constitutional
right,
and
we
believe
that
this
case
should
have
been
disposed
of
on
qualified
immunity
grounds.
in
fact,
in
the
recent
linear
case,
which
analogizes
to
the
qualified
immunity
context,
this
court
specifically
pointed
out
that
when
the
case
law
leaves
open
the
general
rule
to
be
applied,
then
it's
necessary
that
there
be
a
very
high
degree
of
factual
particularity
in
order
to
overcome
that
immunity.
in
the
context
of
a
police
pursuit
that
occurred
in
may
of
1990,
no
such
factual
particularity
was
present.
there
were
several
cases
that
had
analyzed
this
issue.
however,
in
those
cases,
excepting
the
checki
v.
webb
case,
there
were
no
violations
found,
and
only
in
checki
was
there
some
suggestion
there
may
have
been
a
violation.
but
circumstances
in
that
case
law
had
involved
excessive
speeds,
traveling
too
closely,
failing
to
activate
lights
and
sirens,
failing
to
call
in
by
radio,
alleged
violations
of
departmental
policies,
alleged
violations
of
state
law,
all
of
which
had
resulted
in
a
finding
of
no
liability,
so
certainly
the
factual
contours
were
not
sufficiently
developed
in
may
of
1990
to
provide
and
put
a
reasonable
officer
on
notice
that
he
could
be
held
liable.
but
in
the
malley
case,
this
court
points
out
that,
specifically,
if
reasonable
officers
could
disagree
as
to
whether
there
may
have
been
a
violation,
then
the
immunity
applies,
and
petitioners
respectfully
submit
that
in
fact
that's
exactly
what
occurred
in
this
case.
reasonable
officers
could
certainly
disagree
as
to
whether
there
was
some
potential
for
liability
in
may
of
1990
arising
out
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case
and
the
context
of
alleged
violation
of
substantive
due
process,
and
on
that
basis
petitioners
respectfully
request
that
this
court
find
that
there
was
qualified
immunity
that
deputy
smith
is
entitled
to,
and
therefore
petitioners
prevail.
if
this
court
proceeds
to
analyze
what
the
proper
legal
standard
is
with
respect
to
an
alleged
violation
of
substantive
due
process,
then
petitioners
respectfully
submit
that
the
standard
should
be
one
that
is
either
arbitrary
or
shocks
the
conscience.
in
that
regard,
i
think
it's
important
to
look
at
the
policy
considerations
which
may
be
affected.
specifically,
there
should
be
deference
given
to
the
political
process
and
the
nature
of
the
interests
involved
in
the
type
of
case
in
the
circumstance
or
in
the
context
of
a
police
pursuit.
there's
also
the
impact--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--you
are
correct,
justice
stevens,
in
that
the
individual
officer
is
immune.
however,
the
entity
may
be
held
liable
under
appropriate
circumstances.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
correct.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
that's
correct.
however,
they
leave
the
individual
officer
out
of
the
context
of
that
civil
liability,
and
there
is
a
specific
statutory
scheme
which
has
been
adopted
by
california
that
not
only
allows
for
the
potential
for
a
municipality
to
be
liable
in
the
context
of
a
code
3
emergent
vehicle
operation,
but
also
specifically
the
legislature
has
adopted
a
statute
that
encourages
departments
in
california
to
adopt
an
appropriate
police
or
law
enforcement
agency
policy
regarding
pursuits
so
as
to
potentially
avoid
liability
if
the
accident
results
from
the
vehicle
operated
by
the
suspect.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
yes.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
correct.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
and
a
portion
of
that
was
dismissed
at
the
district
court
level
and
a
portion
of
that
was
reserved,
specifically
whether
or
not
the
county
of
sacramento
would
be
immune
from
liability
under
the
vehicle
code
section
that
provides
for
the
adoption
of
an
appropriate
pursuit
policy
as
well
as
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
was
an
accident
that
resulted
from
the
operation
of
the
suspect's
vehicle
in
this
case.
i
think
that
if
the
less
stringent
standard
is
adopted
by
the
court
in
this
case,
then
it
will
effectively
remove
this
type
of
claim
from
the
political
process.
this
type
of
claim
is
appropriate
to
be
resolved
by
the
states
in
adopting
their
state
tort
laws.
specifically,
the
persons
directly
affected,
whether
it
be
the...
in
the
category
of
suspects
or
in
the
category
of
innocent
bystanders,
it
is
clear
that
the
states
and
those
bystanders,
being
the
very
electorate
that
affect
the
laws
of
the
state,
should
have
a
say
in
whether
or
not
there
should
be
recovery.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
but
indirectly,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do
that
through
our
state
legislatures,
and
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
has
looked
to
to
see
whether
or
not
states
would
adopt
and
should
adopt
appropriate
laws
to
govern
these
types
of
situations,
and
that's
what
the
court
referred
to
in
collins,
directing
to
leave
this
to
the
area
of
the
local
representatives,
rather
than
an
interpretation
of
the
charter
of
the
government
for
this
entire
country.
then
it
becomes
a
judicial
interpretation
as
opposed
to
a
political
interpretation.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
i
understood
that
was
the
analysis
in
the
collins
case.
however,
we
would
respect
that
there
should
be
some
deference
given
to
the
state
political
process
as
explored
in
the
deshaney
decision,
because
that
is
important
to
determine
whether
this
court
will
expand
its
interpretation
of
claims
for
substantive
violations
of
due
process.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
well,
i
believe
that
the
initiation
and
continuing
of
high
speed
pursuits
are
not
arbitrary,
at
least
in
most
circumstances.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
i
believe
that's
correct.
there
is
a
rational
purpose,
more
often
than
not,
i
think,
in
the
substantial
number
of
police
pursuits
that
allow
for
those
pursuits
to
take
place.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
well,
because
i
believe
that,
in
terms
of
the
bill
of
rights
and
specifically
the
fourth
amendment,
that
those
are
directed
toward
guaranteeing
certain
minimal
levels
of
safety,
whereas
the
fourteenth
amendment
is
essentially
the
residual
provision.
it's
a
limitation
on
state
powers
as
opposed
to
the
guarantees
that
would
fall
within
the
fourth
amendment,
and--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--well,
that
would
be
true,
your
honor--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--well,
that
is
true,
and
that
we
are
still
in
the
realm
potentially
of
the
show
of
authority,
as
opposed
to
the
actual
means
put
in
motion
to
cause
the
apprehension.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
no.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
under
the
fourth
amendment,
or
fourteenth?
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
i'm
sorry,
i...
is
there
any
case
law--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--correct.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
i
don't
know
that
we
concede
that
it
should
be
something
less
than
intentional,
so--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
believe--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
believe
we
did
state
that
it
would
be
necessary
in
the
context
of
adopting
the
shocks-the-conscience
standard
that
that
be
aligned
with
the
need
for
intentional
and
deliberate
conduct
in
order
to
support
a
violation
for
substantive
due
process
under
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
that's
correct.
we
believe
that
the
logical
extension
of
shocks
the
conscience,
in
terms
of
the
framework
of
defining
such
a
claim,
would
be
that
of
the
language
previously
adopted
by
judge
friendly
in
johnson
v.
glick,
whether
in
fact
there
was
conduct
on
the
part
of
an
officer
that
was
malicious
or
sadistic
for
the
very
purpose
of
causing
harm,
and
only
in
those
circumstances
could
there
potentially
be
a
claim
asserted
for
a
violation
of
substantive
due
process
in
the
context
of
a
police
pursuit.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
correct.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
well--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
believe
that
third
area
should
be
handled
by
the
states
under
the
states--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--process
and
should
not
be--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
have
difficulty
finding
that
that
perhaps
would
not
shock
the
conscience.
however,
that
may
fall--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--that
may
also
be
a
claim
under
the
fourth
amendment,
because
that
person
effected
a
seizure
of
that
party.
if
it's
a
nonpolice
officer
it
may
not
be,
but
that...
it's
our
position
that
that
gray
area...
the
fourth
amendment
would
handle
the
claims
for
alleged
unreasonable
seizures
of
the
person.
the
fourteenth
amendment,
as
petitioners
have
proposed,
should
be
limited
to
only
those
claims
that
involve
conduct
that
shocks
the
conscience.
any
other
areas
should
be
covered
by
the
state
tort
law
and
the
political
process
in
the
states
to
adopt
the
appropriate
tort
remedies
as
the
legislatures
in
the
states
see
fit.
a
good
example
of
that
is
all
of
the
statistical
data
that
was
submitted
to
this
court
in
the
context
of
police
pursuits.
this
court
should
not,
certainly,
be
forced
to
wade
through
all
of
those
statistical
statistics
in
order
to
make
its
decision
in
this
case.
however,
the
states
are
in
the
position
to
assess
what
statistical
data
is
appropriate
and
to
determine
what
remedies
should
be
invoked,
and
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--i
believe
checki
is
an
illustration.
for
instance,
another
illustration
would
potentially
be
when
an
officer
knows
the
identity
of
a
suspect
and
could
apprehend
them
at
a
later
time,
but
however
proceeds
to
intentionally
harass
and
threaten
that
person
by
tail-gating
them
at
2
to
3
feet
at
speeds
in
excess
of
100
miles
an
hour.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
because
i
believe
that
this
court
has
previously
addressed
that
question
regarding
the
show
of
authority
in
the
hodari
case,
and
there
is
no
seizure,
and
that
was
confirmed
by
this
court's
opinion
in
brower.
with
that,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
defer
my
time.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
think
there
is
a
simple
remedy
in
that
case...
in
this
case,
and
that
is,
to
pull
over
and
stop
and
yield
to
lawful
authority.
it's
the
criminal
that
initiates
the
reckless
conduct
and
endangers
the
public.
the
law
enforcement
officer
is
simply
trying
to
apprehend
the
suspect
and
uphold
his
duties
of
office.
in
this
case--
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
--only
to
the
extent
the
issues
presented
on
the
petitions
for
the
writ
before
this
court
were
exactly
the
same
question
presented
in
the
reverse,
and
this
court
declined
hearing--
mr.
terence

--no,
certainly
not
authority,
your
honor,
but
some
indication
that
this
court
has
approved
of
that
analysis
as
opposed
to
this
court's...
the
ninth
circuit's
analysis
in
this
case.
mr.
terence
j.
cassidy
accepted,
your
honor.
quickly,
petitioners
would
prevail
because
there
was
no
fourth
amendment
claim
in
this
case,
so
even
if
this
court
were
to
determine
that
the
fourth
amendment
applied,
not
only
was
there
no
seizure
in
this
case,
but
no
fourth
amendment
claim
was
asserted.
in
terms
of
the
factual
circumstances,
petitioners
respectfully
submit
deputy
smith
was
acting
appropriately,
and
that
in
fact
mr.
lewis
did
initiate
and
cause
mr.
willard
to
proceed
and
flee
from
deputy
smith.
mr.
willard
admitted
in
deposition
that
he
knew
deputy
smith
was
trying
to
stop
him
initially
and
during
the
course
of
the
pursuit
and
if,
in
fact,
this
pursuit
was
coming
to
a
conclusion
because
these
two
individuals
decided
to
stop,
you
don't
yield
to
lawful
authority
in
the
middle
of
the
road.
the
simple
fact
of
the
matter
is,
they
crashed
the
motor
cycle
in
the
middle
of
the
road,
because
had
they
made
good
their
left-hand
turn
about
a
150
feet
down
the
road
or
so
there's
a
barrier
that
would
not
let
police
vehicles
through
but
the
motor
cycle
would
make
good
its
escape.
i
think
there
is
a
valid
justification
in
the
fact
that
pursuits
are
conducted
and
oftentimes
result
in
finding
suspects
who
have
committed
more
serious
crimes,
and
i
think
that's
an
important
policy
consideration
that
this
court
should
look
to.
in
addition,
with
all
the
discussion
we've
had
here
today,
petitioners
would
respectfully
submit
that
it
seems
clear
that
deputy
smith
is
entitled
to
qualified
immunity
on
the
grounds
that
the
law
was
clearly
not
established
sufficiently
in
may
of
1990
to
hold
deputy
smith
liable.
moreover,
if
this
court
determines
that
there
is
potentially
a
claim
under
the
fourteenth
amendment,
then
we
would
submit
the
appropriate
legal
standard
is
conduct
that
shocks
the
conscience,
and
collins
is
controlling.
the
cases
which
fall
in
between
the
cracks,
so
to
speak,
are
those
to
be
left
for
the
states
to
decide.
that's
specifically
the
type
of
policy
choices
that
should
be
made
by
the
people
of
the
various
states
through
their
local
representatives,
but
should
not
be
thrust
upon
them
by
the
judicial
expansion
of
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
thank
you.
with
that,
submitted.
