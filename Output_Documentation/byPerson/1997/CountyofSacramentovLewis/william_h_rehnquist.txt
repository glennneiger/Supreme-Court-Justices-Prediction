chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1337,
the
county
of
sacramento
v.
teri
lewis
and
thomas
lewis.
mr.
cassidy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
you
take
the
position
that
there
was...
a)
there
was
no
violation,
but
b)
if
you
should
find
a
violation,
there
was
nonetheless
qualified
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
we
don't
ordinarily
say
that
if
there's...
when
we're
trying
to
interpret
a
provision
of
the
constitution
that
the
public
ought
to
have
some
input
on
it.
i
mean,
certainly
we
hear
argument
and
we
try
to
figure
out
what
those
who
adopted
that
provision
may
mean,
but
we
don't
generally
say
that,
let's
hear
what
the
people
have
to
say
about
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
think
collins
first
evaluated
whether
or
not
there
was
a
substantive
due
process
violation
and
said
no,
and
said,
therefore
this
is
left
to
the
political
process.
i
mean,
i
think
you
first
have
to
do
your
reasoning
on
the
constitutional
point,
then
the
result
may
be
that
it's
left
to
the
political
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
cassidy,
doesn't
the
fourth
amendment
itself
speak
in
terms
of
unreasonableness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
that
would
supply
the
standard
for
the
fourth
amendment
but
perhaps
would
not
supply
the
standard
for
some
other
analysis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
what
you're
saying
that
conduct
which
is
not
intentional
very
likely
would
not
shock
the
conscience?
shock
the
conscience
suggests
something
moral,
and
simply
gross
negligence
perhaps
does
not
raise
any
moral
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
cassidy.
mr.
hedlund,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
that
true
after
our
opinion
in
conner
v.
graham,
as
well
as
before?
i
know
that
there
had
been
some
considerable
use
of
the
substantive
due
process
in
dealing
with
police
use
of
force
in
arrests
before
our
opinion
in
conner,
but
in
conner,
of
course,
we
said
those
kinds
of
things
come
under
the
fourth
amendment.
are
the
cases
you're
talking
about,
do
they
come
after
conner?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
those
are
two
quite
different
concepts,
aren't
they?
shocks
the
conscience
certainly
connotes
something
intentional,
whereas
reckless
disregard
connotes
something...
indifference,
but
not
intent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
reckless
intent
is
a...
kind
of
is
an
oxymoron.
reckless
means
you
don't
care,
and
intent
means
you
do.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you...
if,
as
you
say,
you
can
persuade
a
jury
that
the
police
officer
just
did
this
intentionally,
as
justice
scalia
says,
you
will
win
under
any
standard.
but
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
analyze
it
as
if
that
were
the
case.
it
analyzed
it
as
if
it
were
gross
negligence.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what
did
the
ninth
circuit
decide
was
the
standard?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
that
still
is
not
your
case,
where
the
police
officer
simply
guns
the
motor--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--sees
this
guy
standing
there,
says,
i'm
going
to
kill
him.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
just
coasted
in
and
intentionally--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
that
high
speed
auto
chases
are
the
sort
of
thing
that
the
fourteenth
amendment
was
designed
to
address?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
1868?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
carriage
chases,
perhaps.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
something
like
the
federal
tort
claims
act
where
the
governmental
body
is
substituted
for
the
individual
who
may
have
been
negligent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
judgment-proof,
or--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
maybe
they're
fighting
it
because
they
think
the
ninth
circuit
was
wrong
and
didn't
follow
our
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
happened
before.
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
don't
announce
policy
mr.--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--you
know--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
hedlund.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cassidy,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cassidy.
the
case
is
submitted.
