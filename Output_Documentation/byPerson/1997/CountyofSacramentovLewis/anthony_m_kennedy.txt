justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
we're
here
to
talk
about
what
standard
should
be
applied
in
determining
these
cases--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
whether
or
not
the
ninth
circuit
was
correct.
if
collins
v.
harker
heights
controls
the
case,
what
should
be
the
outcome?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
not
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
was
it?
the
court
of
appeals
held
reckless
indifference,
which
is
really
mistaking
the
analysis
given
in
collins.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
in
collins
we
used,
of
course,
reckless
indifference,
but
that
was
just
to
get
over
the
monell
liability
problem,
not
the
substantive
problem.
so
you
are,
then,
not
defending
the
ninth
circuit
analysis,
i
take
it.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
did
you
think
it
was
correct
under
collins,
despite
the
fact
that
they
used
the
second
prong
test,
municipal
liability,
to
determine
the
first
question,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
substantive
violation?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
that's
quite...
exactly
contrary
to
what
the
court
held
in
collins.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
collins
is
an
interpretation
of
the
substantive
due
process
clause,
and
it
uses
the
shocks-the-conscience
test.
it
tried
to
give
it
an
objective
component,
not
a
subjective
component,
and
the
ninth
circuit
is
the
only
one
that
seems
to
have
misunderstood
it,
and
it
has
done
so
in
your
case,
and
so
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
can,
on
the
one
hand
say
that
you
like
being
with
collins
and
on
the
other
hand
defend
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
there
was
no
question
in
collins
whether
or
not
a
governmental
official
was
involved,
and
i'm
not
sure--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--i
know
of
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
depending
on
whether
or
not
you're
a
police
officer
or
some
other
municipal
employee
the
standard
of...
under
the
due
process
clause
differs.
do
you--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--what
is
the...
what
case
do
you
have
for
that?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
because
the
standard
of
shock-the-conscience
was
not
met.
we're
talking
about
standards.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
we
don't
have
different
standards
of
liability
under
the
fourteenth
amendment
depending
on
a
whole
range
of
different
governmental
officers.
if
the
injury
is
the
same
we
base
it
on
what
the
injury
is.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
going
to
either
defend
the
ninth
circuit
analysis
or
you're
not,
and
if
you're
going
to
defend
the
ninth
circuit
analysis,
then
you
have
to
ask
us
to
alter
the
analysis
that
we
used
in
collins.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--well,
you
have
this
big
wind-up,
but
what's
the
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question?
what
is
the
standard
under
the
fourth
amendment.
we're
talking
about
standards
here.
we
can
apply
those
standards
to
the
facts
in
the
judicial
system,
but
we
want
to
know
what
the
standard
is--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--so
we
can
instruct
the
ninth
circuit--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--whether
it
was
correct
or
not.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
you
think
a
car
with
lights
on
is
worse?
you
think
a
marked
police
car
is
worse?
