mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
each
of
the
six
federal
employees
in
this
case
engaged
in
sanctionable
employment-related
misconduct
and
then
knowingly
and
intentionally
falsely
denied
the
misconduct
when
questioned
by
agency
investigators.
the
court
below
held,
however,
that
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process
the
government,
as
employer,
may
not
charge
these
employees
with
both
misconduct
and
lying
about
the
misconduct.
indeed,
the
court
went
beyond
that
to
hold
that
an
employee's
deliberate
falsification
may
not
even
be
considered
in
determining
the
penalty
for
the
separate
underlying
misconduct.
there
is
nothing
whatsoever
in
the
due
process
clause
or
anywhere
else
in
the
constitution,
for
that
matter,
that
prevents
a
government
agency
from
sanctioning
an
employee
who
deliberately
lies
in
response
to
questions
about
employment
misconduct,
whether
or
not
the
employee
is
also
sanctioned
for
the
misconduct
itself.
when
the
government
acts
as
an
employer,
it
has
the
right
to
demand
that
its
employees
respond
honestly
to
work-related
questions
and
to
sanction
them
if
they
do
not,
just
as
all
other
employers
do.
indeed,
the
government
has
more
reason
to
demand
honesty
from
its
employees,
as
they
employ...
as
they
enjoy
a
public
trust.
as
this
court
held
in
lefkowitz
v.
cunningham,
the
government
has
a
compelling
interest
in
honest
civil
service.
the
holding
of
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case
imposes
profound
anomalies
and
perverse
incentives.
wrongdoers
who
tell
the
truth
are
required
under
this
holding
to
be
punished
just
as
severely
as
wrongdoers
who
then
knowingly
and
intentionally
lie
about
their
misconduct
when
questioned
by
an
investigator
or
a
tribunal.
an
employee
who
is
questioned
about
wrongdoing
can
be
punished
for
lying
about
it
if
he
didn't
do
any
wrong,
but
if
he
did
do
wrong
and
lies
about
it,
he
can't
be
separately
punished
for
lying
about
it.
under
the
federal
circuit
rule,
a
rational
employee
questioned
about
wrongdoing
will
always
lie,
since
it's
cost-free
and
perhaps
he
will
fool
or
dissuade
the
agency.
he
would
be
irrational
to
'fess
up
and,
indeed,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
the
consequences,
that
the
rationale
of
the
federal
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
goes
beyond
just
what
the
individual
agency
can
do
and
presumably
would
also
prevent
the
government
in
its
sovereign
capacity
from
making
the
false
statements
1001
or,
if
their
statements
were
under
oath,
for
perjury.
so
we
submit
that
the
decision
of
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case,
which
doesn't
follow
any
decisions
by
this
court
or
any
decisions
by
any
other
federal
court,
is
simply
wrong
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
boy,
the
only
spillover
effect
it
could
have,
justice
o'connor,
would
be
if
you
found
an
exculpatory
no
doctrine
required
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
because
the
argument
in
favor
of
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine
in
every
court
that
has
adopted
some
form
of
it
has
done
so
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction,
trying
to
define
what
congress
could
have
intended.
there's
no
statute
at
issue
in
this
case
that
that
could
be
read
into.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
may--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
could
often
be
the
case,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
the
moral
that
we
hope
people
will
derive
from
the
long
line
of
cases
in
which
this
court
has
held
that
even
where
there
are
important
constitutional
guarantees
at
issue,
for
example,
in...
under
the
self-incrimination
clause,
there
is
never
a
license
to
lie.
here,
of
course,
the
self-incrimination
clause
is
not
even
in
play.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
a
couple
of
answers.
first
of
all,
in
a
number
of
the
cases
that
are
collected
in
this...
before
this
court,
the
false
statements
were
written.
that
is,
the
employee
was
given
a
list
of
questions,
or
a
series
of
questions
and
provided
written
answers.
in
other
instances,
the
employees
either
repeated
or
made
their
lies
after
they
were
put
under
oath,
so
you
can't
characterize
the
federal
circuit's
decision
in
this
case
as
somehow
limited
to
an
informal
oral
question
by
an
investigator.
but
even
if
you
could,
that
might
go
to
the
question
of
whether
the
agency
could
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
individual
employee
had
knowingly
and
with
intent
to
deceive
given
a
false
statement.
that
is,
it
may
make
it
more
difficult
for
the
agency
to
establish
that
the
misconduct
had
occurred,
but
as
a
constitutional
matter,
i
wouldn't
think
that
any
a
priori
rule
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
is
a
purely
constitutional
holding.
the
only
statute
that's
really...
it's
not
even
at
issue
in
this
case.
i
don't
even
think
that
the
federal
circuit
cited
the
statute,
although
i
may
be
mistaken...
is
5
u.s.c.
section
7513,
which
provides
that
an
agency
may
take
action
against
an
employee
for
misconduct
"only
for
such
cause
as
will
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service.
"
and
one
of
the
things
that
the
agency
has
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
is
not
only,
of
course,
that
the
misconduct
occurred,
but
that
there
is
a
nexus
between
the
sanction
that
the
agency
has
imposed
and
"the
promotion
of
the
efficiency
of
this...
of
the
service.
"
that's
required
both
in
the
statute
and
by
a
decision
of
law.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
sure.
we
can
ask
that...
the
federal
circuit
to
reconsider
any
panel
decision
en
banc.
the
earlier
precedent
that
you're
referring
to,
a
case
called
grubka--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
must
say
that
although
several
panels
of
the
mspb
itself
in
several
instances
in
these
cases
felt
that
the
result
that
was
ultimately
reached
by
the
federal
circuit
was
dictated
by
grubka,
but
there
are
other...
there
were
other
mspb
decisions
that
basically
distinguish
grubka.
i'm
not
certain,
but
i
believe
that
we
did
ask
the
federal
circuit
at
least
in
this
case
to
reconsider
this
panel
decision
en
banc.
i
don't
know
whether
we
did
in
grubka
or
not.
frankly,
i
think
it's
reading
a
lot
into
grubka
to
conclude
that
grubka
dictates
the
result
that
was
reached
by
the
board
and
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case.
that
was
a
highly
unusual
case
which
is
and
was
distinguished
by
the
mspb
subsequently
on
what
i
think
are
reasonable
grounds.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
they
did
say
that,
but
it's
a
little
bit
curious
because
all
six
of
the
employees
in
this
case
were
alleged
and
proven
to
have
made...
to
have
lied
during
the
investigative
stage.
now,
some
of
them
also
lied
during
the
"administrative
stage",
but
one
of
the
curious
things
about
the
federal
circuit's
decision
is
that
in
dicta
it
does
say,
well,
of
course
due
process
wouldn't
in
any
way
protect
lying
at
the
investigative
stage,
but
that's
exactly
what
happened
in
each
one
of
these
cases.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
10
minutes
for
rebuttal,
if
i
may.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
mr.
marth
may
be
simply
have
misunderstood
or
not
know
what
the
facts
are
with
respect
to
the
other
five
employees
before
this
case,
but
he
surely
knows
what
the
facts
are
with
respect
to
his
client,
sergeant
erickson,
who
was
not
put
in
a
room
and
told
he
had
to
answer
a
series
of
rapid-fire
questions.
the
record
in
this
case
reflects
that
mr....
that
sergeant
williamson
at
7:20
in
the
morning
signed
a
kalkind
statement
acknowledging
that
he
has...
may
be
asked
to
provide
answers
to
questions:
i've
been
advised
that
i
have
a
right
to
remain
silent,
but
that
i
may
be
subject
to
disciplinary
action
for
failure
to
answer
material
and
relevant
questions.
i've
been
further
advised
that
the
answers
i
give
to
these
questions,
or
any
evidence
gained
by
reason
of
my
answers--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
was
absolutely
not
necessary.
i
just
don't
want
this
court
to
be
under
the
misimpression
that
this
man
was
somehow
treated
unfairly,
3
hours
later--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's...
that's
right.
he
could
simply
have
said,
i
don't
remember,
or
i'd
like
to
take
time
to
think
about
it,
or
he
could
have
confessed,
and
that
was
the
case
with
respect
to
all--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
have
as
an...
the
government
as
an
employer
has
the
right
to
ask
that
they
do
that,
even
if
we
had
been
"unreasonable"
and
put
him
on
the
spot
and
said,
look,
we're
investigating
this
mad
laugher
incident,
and
were
you...
do
you
or
do
you
not
know
anything
about
that,
but
none
of
the
cases
before
this
court
are
anything
approaching
that.
ms.
walsh,
who
supposedly
was
asked
on
the
spot
to
talk
about
events
that
happened
3
years
before,
was
accompanied
by
an
attorney,
made
a
long,
discursive
statement
in
response
to
questions,
and
there
was
a
transcript.
she
could
easily
have
said,
i
don't
remember.
it
was
a
long
time
ago.
she
gave
a
whole
false
story
about
a
long
relationship
she
had.
you
are
right.
it
does
not
matter
as
a
constitutional
matter.
i
just
wanted
the
record
to
be
clear
with
respect
to
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's...
that's
right,
and
the
problem
that
justice
breyer
was
suggesting
that
some
people
may
have
with
the
potential
for
abuse
i
think
is
dealt
with
very
adequately
by
congress
and
by
the
office
of
personnel
management
in
the
relevant
stat...
provisions
of
the
civil
service
protection
act
and
the
implementing
regulations.
in
5
u.s.c.
section
2301,
that
is
the
statutory
provision
that
enunciates
the
merit
systems
principles,
it
states,
among
other
things,
that
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law
all
employees
and
applicants
for
employee...
employment
should
receive
fair
and
equitable
treatment
in
all
instances
of
personnel
management,
and
it
goes
on.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
is
simply
no
doubt
that
the
federal
circuit
was
ruling
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
due
process.
it
says
so
over
and
over
and
over
again.
when
you
get
to
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
basis
whatsoever...
that
would
be
the
most
muscular
interpretation
of
the
statute
imaginable.
i
don't
think
there
would
be
any
basis
for
it,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
that's...
you
mean
by
the
court
below?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
rather--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that's
rather
muscular.
we'll
take
it,
whatever
this
court's
judgment
is.
the
question
presented
is
a
constitutional
one.
i
think
the
reason
that
there's
no
statutory
question
in
this
case
is
that
there
simply
is
no
statutory
provision
to
which
this
claim
could
be
attached.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it's...
look,
it's
not
how...
it
isn't
how
the
government
has
read
the
opinion,
but
it
would
be
wonderful
if
the
court
could
so
read
the
opinion
and
then
hold
that
even
as
a
matter
of
statutory
construction
it
simply
cannot
be
that
as
an
a
priori
matter
it
doesn't
promote
the
efficiency
of
the
service
to
sanction
employees
who
deliberately
and
intentionally
lie
to
their
employers.
we
haven't
read
it
that
way,
but
if
the
court
feels
that
it
could,
we'd
embrace
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
we'll
submit.
thank
you.
