justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
tell
us
that
the
question
presented
was
not
presented
in
your
opposition
to
the
petition,
because
the
question
presented
surely
says
what
you
say
is
not
at
issue
here,
whether
the
due
process
clause
precludes
a
federal...
the
due
process
clause
precludes
a
federal
agency
from
sanctioning
an
employee
for
making
false
statements
to
the
agency
regarding
allegations
that
the
employee
had
engaged
in
employment-related
conduct.
i
mean,
that's
what
i
thought
we
were
here
to
talk
about,
and
you're
saying
it
is
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
i
thought
that's
what
you
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
ask
my
question
again,
then.
i
thought
i
had
an
answer,
but
then...
then
you
go
back
and
said
the
same
thing
again.
do
you
agree
that
the
question
presented
here
is
whether
the
due
process
clause
requires
the
outcome?
justice
antonin
scalia
well...
okay.
and
what
in
your
opinion,
mr.
marth,
is
the
case
from
this
court
that
most
closely
supports
the
result,
the
constitutional
result
reached
by
the
court
of
appeals
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
which,
indeed,
she
had
been
doing.
that's
a
risk
that
she--
[laughter]
a
risk
that
materialized
because
of
her
own
conduct.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
doesn't
there
have
to
be
intentional
misrepresentation?
doesn't
the
government
have
to
show
it's
intentional?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
doesn't
that
solve
that
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
marth,
can
i...
let
me
express
what...
the
trouble
i
have
with
your
presentation.
you're
relying
on
the
due
process
clause
which
prevents
the
deprivation
of
life,
liberty,
or
property
without
due
process,
and
your
claim
here
is
that
the
property
of
this
job,
this
federal
job
is
unfairly
taken
away
unless
the
individual
is
allowed
to
make
misstatements
during
the
administrative
proceeding
that
would
result
in
taking
it
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
in
the
investigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
once
the
proceeding
starts,
however,
you
agree
that
there's
no
such--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
marth,
maybe
you
agreed
too
quickly
that
justice
breyer
had
a
problem.
i
mean,
justice
breyer
said
he
tries
not
to
lie.
were
your
clients
trying
not
to
lie?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
if
they
were
trying
not
to
lie,
nothing
could
happen
to
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
risk
is
that
something
could
happen
to
them
if
it
were
proven
that
they
were
not
trying
not
to
lie.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
life
is
tough.
we
all
have
to,
you
know,
live
in
some
risk,
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
can't
be
eliminated.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
you
would
never
give
them
a
right
to
be
silent,
only
to
lie.
[laughter]
i
mean...
but
that
will
be
the
scheme
you
come
up
with.
he
can
be
prosecuted
if
he
says,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
want
to
answer,
and
then
he
can
be
removed
for
failing
to
cooperate.
if
he
had
only
lied,
he
would
have
been
okay.
isn't
that
what
we
end
up
with?
isn't
that
the
logical
position
you're
arguing,
or
are
you
saying
they
should
also
have
a
right
to
be
silent?
you
have
a
choice,
to
lie
or
be
silent,
either
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
we've
muscled
that
around
before,
right?
[laughter]
