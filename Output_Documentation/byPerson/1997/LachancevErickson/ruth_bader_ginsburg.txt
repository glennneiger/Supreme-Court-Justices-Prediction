is
there
any
concern
about
the
conduct
on
the
part
of
the
agent,
because
most
of
these
interviews
are
on
a
one-to-one
basis,
so
is
that
perhaps
what's
reflected
in
this,
that
if
you
had
a
written
record
or...
and
the
person,
the
employee
when
confronted
lies,
that's
one
thing,
but
if
it's
just
an
oral
translation,
how
can
you
be
sure
that
the
one
who's
doing
the
interview
isn't
dissembling?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
as
i
understand
this
panel
of
the
federal
circuit,
they
were
following
a
precedent
already
set,
and
all
these
mspb
cases
nowadays
do
go
to
that
one
circuit.
was
there
any
procedure
that
might
have
been
used
to
get
the
court
to
sit
en
banc
and
perhaps
reconsider
the
precedent
that
was
relied
on
in
this
case?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
was
one
curiosity
in
the
federal
circuit's
opinion.
that
is,
they
seemed
to
draw
a
line
between...
they
said
if
it's
at
the
investigative
stage
then
the
employee
could
be
punished.
was
the--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
now--
--mr.
marth,
you're
drawing
a
large
distinction
between
the
public
and
private
sector,
and
as
i
was
reading
your
arguments
i
was
thinking,
in
the
case
that
we
just
heard,
it's
something
that
can
only
be
between
a
government
and
its
citizens,
but
here
we
have
an
employment
setting.
employees
lie
to
private
employers
like
they
do
to
public
employers,
so
it
seems
to
me
you're
extracting
from
due
process
a
right
for
a
public
employee
that
surely
does
not
exist
in
a
private
employer.
if
that
employer
is
lied
to
he
can
say,
i
don't
want
dissembling
employees
on
my
staff,
goodbye.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
even
this
case,
how
does
it
fit
with
what
the
federal
circuit
said
its
narrow
holding
was,
that
as
it
said,
that
false
statements
made
during
agency
investigations
may
properly
be
subject
to
falsification
or
similar
charges?
why
wasn't
what
went
on
part
of
an
investigation?
why
doesn't...
shouldn't
we
read
what
the
federal
circuit
says
the
law
is,
apply
it
to
that
fact,
and
doesn't...
that
person
doesn't
come
within
this
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
but
this
seems
to
say
just
the
opposite.
it
says,
of
course,
when
they...
during
the
investigation
they
may
be
subject
to--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
mspb
ruled
in
favor
of
these
employees,
as
i
understand
it,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
was
affirmed.
so
wouldn't
that
same
mspb,
as
policer
of
this,
be
able
to
make
distinctions
between
the
employee
who
came
across
as
terribly
nervous
and
just
tripped
up
a
little,
and
say,
that
one,
firing
is
too
much
for
that,
and
then
take
the
one
who's
deliberately
trying
to
put
the
investigators
off
the
track
and
say...
make
the
penalty
fit
the
crime.
you
do
have
a
policer
in
here
independent
of
the
agency,
and
that
is
the
mspb.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
we're
dealing
with
a
case
that
comes
to
us
through
the
mspb.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
marth,
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question
about
the
relationship
of
the
prior
decisionmakers?
did
the
mspb
get
this
rule
from
the
federal
circuit's
prior
decision,
or
did
it
originate
with
the
mspb?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
it
wasn't
mspb
as...
mspb
was
not
the
originator.
