we'll
hear
argument
next
in
number
96-1395,
janice
lachance
v.
lester
erickson.
general
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
the
moral
of
that
is
don't
lie.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
the...
did
the
federal
circuit
in
this
case
rest
its
holding
on
any
statutory
ground,
or
was
it
a
purely
constitutional
holding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--very
well,
general
waxman.
mr.
marth,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
i
see.
you're--
--the
constitution
required
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
was
that
denied
to
these
respondents?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
it
was
simply
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
why
did
the
court
of
appeals
refer
to
the
due
process
clause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
even
if
the
precise
issue
hasn't,
what
is
the
constitutional
decision
from
this
court
that
most
closely
supports
your
position?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there's
no
question
of
using
the
statements
here
against
these
people
in
some
other
proceeding,
is
there?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
government
isn't
trying
to
use
them...
the
government
isn't
trying
to
obtain
a
criminal
conviction
by
using
these
statements
in
some
sort
of
a
criminal
proceeding,
is
it?
the
statements
were
just
used
in
the
proceeding
in
which
they
were
given.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
no
criminal
consequences
resulted
in
these
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what's
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
chilling
effect
on
lying.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
penalty
the
same
for
simply
saying,
i
don't
care
to
discuss
it,
as
it
is
for
lying?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
it
would
mislead,
if
you're
asked
a
question,
did
you
misuse
the
credit
card,
and
you
say
no,
i
didn't,
when
in
fact
you
did.
that
surely
misleads
if
anything
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it's
hard
for
me
to
see
how
the...
you
know,
you
could
say
perhaps
a
spinner
of
tall
tales
would
dig
their
own
grave
by
making
extravagant
statements
that
were
easily
refutable,
whereas
perhaps
a
simple
no
would
be
less
easy
to
identify
as
perjurious.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
marth.
mr.
waxman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
