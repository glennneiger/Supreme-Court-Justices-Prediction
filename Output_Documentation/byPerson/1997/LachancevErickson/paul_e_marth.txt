mr.
paul
e.
marth
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
if
the
court
accepts
the
government
position
in
this
case
that
the
federal
circuit
created
a
broad
constitutional
right
to
lie,
then
the
respondents
lose,
because
there
is
no
such
right,
this
court
has
adamantly
over
the
years
asserted
that
there
is
no
such
right,
and
the
respondents
are
not
advocating
that
right
in
this
case.
if,
on
the
other
hand,
this
court
finds
that
the
federal
circuit
narrowly
tailored
a
right
to
protect
the
employee's
meaningful
right
to
respond
to
the
charges,
then
the
respondents
should
prevail.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
no,
your
honor,
i'm
not
saying
that.
i'm
saying
that--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--that
the
government
in
its
brief
and
in
its
argument
has
characterized
this
as
a
broad
constitutional
right
to
lie,
whereas
it's
the
respondents'
position
that
the
federal
circuit
said,
in
a
very
narrowly
tailored
situation,
to
protect
an
employee's
meaningful
right
to
respond,
an
employee
can
deny
misconduct
and
put
the
government
to
its
proof.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
your
honor,
i
disagree
with
general
waxman
with
regard
to
that
issue.
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
and
quoted
5
u.s.
code
7513(b),
which
is
the
provision
which
gives...
and
i
believe
that's
on
page
11a
of
the
appendix...
which
gives
the
employees
certain
rights
when
charges
are
brought
against
them,
and
that
includes
the
right
to
counsel,
the
right
to
a
detailed
statement
of
the
charges,
a
right
to
have
a
period
of
time
of
a
minimum
of
7
days
to
respond
to
those--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--that
was
not
denied,
but
what
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying,
your
honor,
was
that
the
meaningful
right
to
respond
and
the
meaningful
right
to
have
those
rights
was
denied
because
early
on
before
those
rights
were
ever
given,
they
were...
in
effect
could
be...
if
an
employee
was
forced
to
respond
affirmatively
to
the
government
charges
of
misconduct,
that
that
subsequent
meaningful
right
was
denied.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
the
due
process
clause
comes
in
because
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
a
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation
in
this
case
of
those
subsequent
rights
if
an
employee
was
forced
to
respond
without
a...
an
opportunity
to
deny
the
misconduct
at
the
early
stage.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
certainly,
but
the
due
process
clause,
your
honor,
is
based
on
property
rights,
and
the
property
rights
come
from
the
statute.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
never,
to
my
knowledge,
dealt
with
this
issue
in
a
federal
employment
context,
where
they
have
looked
at
the
issues
in
the
context
of
federal
employment.
i'm
not
aware
of
any
case
where
this
precise
issue
has
certainly
come
before
the
court
in
the
past.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
in
garrity
v.
state
of
new
jersey
this
court
said
that
officers
who
are
given
the
choice
of
either
answering
questions
or
losing
their
jobs
had
their
fourteenth
amendment
rights
violated,
and
the
statements
they
gave
were
not
voluntary
and
could
not
be
used
against
them.
that's
probably
the
closest
case,
although
certainly
that
is--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--you
mean,
whether
or
not
these
statements
could
be
used
in
another
proceeding?
mr.
paul
e.
marth
your
honor,
i
would...
or,
chief
justice,
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
prohibition
against
using
those
statements
in
another
context,
but--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
the
employees
certainly
did
not
know
that,
and
there
are
several
employees
in
this
case,
barrett
and
roberts,
for
example,
who
could
have
been
charged
with
taking
government
property,
misappropriation
of
government
property,
ms.
kye
in
this
case,
who
could
have
been
charged
with
some
kind
of
credit
card
fraud
or
abuse,
and
these
employees,
when
they're
brought
into
the
investigation
stage,
are
not
told
by
the
government
whether
or
not
criminal
consequences
are
contemplated.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
justice
ginsburg,
you've
pointed
out
a
real
distinction
between
the
federal
and
the
private
sector,
and
that
is
that
in
the
federal
sector
an
employee
has
absolutely
no
right
to
refuse
to
answer.
in
the
private
sector
there's
no
compulsion
upon
an
employee
to
have
to
answer
the
question,
but
the
federal
circuit
and
the
merit
systems
protection
board
have
held
that
in
any
type
of
investigation
an
employee
does
not
have
a
right
to
refuse
to
cooperate,
so--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--that's
correct,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--your
honor,
and
even
this
case,
ms.
kye,
one
of
the
charges
against
her
was
that
supposedly
she
failed
to
cooperate
in
the
investigation,
so
you're
correct
that
an
employee
is
put
to
a
dilemma.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
that's
a
separate
charge.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
that's
separate
from
that
charge,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
that's
correct,
justice
o'connor.
they
made
it
very--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--it
is
one
we
espouse,
and
the
merit
systems
protection
board
has
had
no
difficulty
applying
that
line,
and
we
contend
that
that
line
is
no
more
difficult--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--the
line
is
that...
the
difference
between
denying
the
charges,
a
simple
denial
of
the
charges
versus
telling
false
tales
or
creating
a
story
to
cover
yourself.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
your
honor,
basically
the
elements
of
what
the
government
had
to
prove
in
her
case
was
that
she
had
misused
her
credit
card.
the
denials
in
effect
were,
no
i
did
not
misuse
my
credit
card,
so
that's
where
the
court
of
appeals
came
down.
they
said
that
when
you
look
at
the
material
facts
that
are
elements
of
the
charge,
in
this
case,
did
you
misuse
your
government
credit
card,
she
denied
it.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
and
she
also
attempted,
your
honor,
to
correct
that
later
on,
and
when
she
attempted
to
correct
it,
and
that's
one
of
the
risks
here,
that
when
that
employee
attempted
to
correct
it
she
was
charged
with
falsifying
evidence
and
her
entire
credibility--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
the
danger
here
that
if
an
employee...
for
example,
in
a
couple
of
these
cases
they
were
asking
questions,
in
ms.
walsh's
case
about
some
conduct
that
occurred
3
years
before,
and
in
the
barrett
and
roberts
case
they
were
asking
them
how
were
they
spending
a
2-hour
period
14
months
before.
so
if
an
employee
who
answers,
and
blurts
out
an
answer...
when
the
government
asks,
for
example,
in
barrett
and
roberts,
were
you
working
on
government
business
on
june
8,
14
months
ago,
between
the
hours
of
1:30
and
3:30,
they
say,
yes,
we
were.
well,
you
know,
the
risk
is
that
then
when
they
check
their
records,
or
have
other
opportunities
to
look
back,
they
may
find
that
indeed
that
that
was
not
what
they
were
doing
14
months
before.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
the
problem
is
the
chilling
effect
on
an
employee
of
denying--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--chilling
effect
on
denying
misconduct.
as
both
justice
kennedy
and
justice
o'connor
have
pointed
out
in
the
former
argument,
what
you
have
here
is,
for
examples,
if
somebody
comes
up,
an
investigator
says,
were
you
5
minutes
late
to
work,
and
you
say,
no,
i
wasn't
5
minutes
late
to
work,
well,
suddenly
what
was
a
5-minutes-late-to-work
charge,
which
may
involve
a
slap
on
the
wrist,
maybe
even
a
written
reprimand,
now
becomes
a
removable
offense.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
your
honor,
but
here
congress
has
said
that
employees,
when
they're
going
to
be
disciplined,
have
certain
rights,
and
the
issue
is,
are
those
rights
to
a
meaningful
opportunity
to
defend
affected
when...
before
those
rights
are
ever
given,
and
here
you
have...
i
think
it's
important
to
understand
the
context.
for
example,
in
mr.
erickson's
case,
the
initial
decision
indicated
that
he
was
put
into
a
room
and
questioned
and
told
to
fill
out
certain
answers
to
questions.
he
asked
for
counsel.
he
was
denied
it.
he
asked
to
leave
the
interview
room.
he
put
down
that
he
felt
that
he
was
under
duress
and
loss
of
his
job
if
he
responded,
so
what
meaningful
opportunities
does
he
have
subsequently
to
respond
when
he
has
been
under
all
this
pressure
and
coercion
early
on
to
respond
to
the
government's
investigation?
mr.
paul
e.
marth
your
honor,
that's
the
one
point
i
agree
with
general
waxman
on.
i
don't
know
how
the
court
of
appeals
could
say
that
in
light
of
these
facts,
unless
the
court
of
appeals
was
saying,
when
you
begin
to
focus
an
investigation
on
a
particular
respondent
similar
to
a
criminal
context,
certain
rights
attach.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
i
mean,
there's
no
question
that
these
questions
were
given
during
the
investigation,
but
what
is
evident
is
that
the
investigation
had
focused
on
the
individual
respondents
in
this
case.
for
example,
in
ms.
walsh's
case,
the
investigator
came
and
said,
we
have
talked
to
10
people,
and
we
have
statements
showing
that
basically
you've
lied
to
us,
or
that
you
are
guilty
of
this
misconduct,
and
you
better
get
your
answers
right,
because
if
you
don't
get
your
answers
right,
we've
got
other
penalties
that
we
can
institute.
so
you're
right,
your
honor,
that
the
court
of
appeals
used
that
phrase
about
an
investigation,
and
the
only
way
that
i
can
reconcile
that
phrase
is
in
terms
of
the
fact
that
the
investigation
had
now
focused
to
the
point
on
these
respondents
that
they
were
in
effect
the
persons
that
were
going
to
be
put
to
the
charges
on.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
not
exactly,
your
honor.
in
terms
of
the
administrative
proceeding
i'm
not
taking
the
position
that
anyone
at
a
merit
systems
protection
board
hearing
has
a
right
to
lie.
in
fact,
we're
saying
specifically
to
the
contrary.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
just
in
the
investigation
prior
to
the
meaningful
rights
that
congress
has
given
in
5
u.s.
code
section
7513.
in
other
words,
when
these
persons
were
all
questioned
they
had
not
been
told
that
they
had
a
right
to
a
lawyer,
they
had
not
been
told
that
they
had
a
right
to
see
the
charges
against
them,
they
were
not
given
any
adequate
time
to
respond
to
the
charges.
they
were
basically
put
in
a
room
and
said,
respond
now.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
i
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
i
don't
think
the
record
is
clear
on
that,
your
honor,
justice
breyer.
as
far
as
i
can
tell,
the
employees
were
not
told
anything
about
that.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
your
honor,
one
thing,
of
course,
that
would
solve
the
problem
would
be
that
there
would
be
no
investigation
questions
to
a
given
employee
who's
under
charges
until
they're
given--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--until
they're
given
their
rights.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
the
legal
framework,
your
honor,
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
decision
and
what
we're
advocating
here
is
that
for
the
meaningful
rights
to
apply,
an
employee
has
to
be
able
to
deny
the
misconduct,
similar
to
a
not
guilty
plea,
and
put
the
government
to
its
proof.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
not
only
an
employee
sanction,
but
a--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--we
are
talking
about
a
double
sanction,
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
no.
no,
your
honor,
you
have
not.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
no,
your
honor.
what
we're
ask...
we're
not
asking
necessarily
that
employees
be
told
anything,
i
think
as
justice
breyer
indicated,
perhaps
maybe
give
employees
some
kind
of
warning
before
they
could
be
questioned.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
right.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
no,
i'm
not
advocating
that.
i
understood
justice
breyer
might
be--
[laughter]
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--well,
the
risk
is
that
something
could
happen
to
them,
your
honor,
and...
justice
scalia.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
for
example,
in
ms.
walsh's
case--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--in
mrs.
walsh--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--i'm
sorry.
excuse
me,
your
honor.
in
mrs.
walsh's
case
the
administrative
judge
that
heard
the
case
found
that
she
did
not
lie,
and
when
it
got
to
the
mspb
they
found
that
she
did
lie,
so
there's
the
risk
of
credibility
determinations
here
becoming...
raising
what
is
a
simple
minor
offense
up
to
a
removable
offense.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
we
do
have
a
policer
for
some
federal
employees,
your
honor,
but
not
for
all.
postal
employees,
for
example,
unless
they're
in
management,
or
unless
they're
veterans--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--right,
but
i
think
it's
important,
though,
if
we're
looking
at
due
process
rights
available
to
the
entire
federal
workforce,
that
the
court
understand
that
not
all
employees
have
a
right
to
get
that
independent
decisionmaker.
for
many
employees
that
final
decisionmaker
is
the
agency
official
that
decides
the
case.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
an
employee
can
certainly
do
that,
and
the
agency
has
the
right
to
bring
charges.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
yes.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
yes.
they
did
in
this
case.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
i
don't
believe
i
was
ever
advocating
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
either
one,
they're
subject
to
potential
penalties.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
i
am
not
sure
on
the
table
of
penalties,
your
honor,
whether
or
not
the
refusal
to
cooperate
in
an
investigation
is
a
removable
offense
or
not,
so
i
cannot
answer
that
question.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
no,
but
that--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--no,
but
that
puts
the
employee
in
the
difficult
situation
where
they're...
where
they're
questioned,
again,
before
they're
given
those
meaningful
rights
that
congress
has
given
them,
that
the
issue
is,
at
that
point,
what
do
they
do?
do
they
lie,
do
they
do
a
simple
no,
which
is
what
the
court
found
happened
in
this
case.
again,
i
mean,
it's
important
to...
for
this
court
to
understand
that
king
v.
erickson
specifically
said,
there's
no
right
to
lie
or
to
affirmatively
mislead
an
agency
engaged
in
investigation.
they
said,
merely
they
had
a
simple
right
to
deny
the
charge,
and
that
they
did
not
have
a
right
to
tell
tall
tales,
to
tamper
with
evidence,
to
falsify
records...
they
came
down
with
a--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--well,
i
guess
there
is
that
issue
of
whether
or
not
a
simple
denial
is
misleading,
or
whether
to
mislead
or
to
deceive
the
government
requires
some
kind
of
more
affirmative
misconduct.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
your
honors,
we
would
contend
that
the
due
process
concerns
in
this
case
with
regard
to
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation,
basically
that
there
are
six
potential
risks
to
the
employees
in
these...
in
this
case.
first,
there
is
the
chilling
effect
stemming
from
the
seriousness
of
the
charge,
which
we've
already
talked
about.
secondly,
an
employee
who
is
not
represented
during
this
process
risks
being
coerced
when
questioned.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
the
federal
circuit
in
grubka
came
up
with
the
proposition
to
begin
with
that
a
person
always
has
the
right
to
deny
a
charge
and
put
the
government
to
its
proof.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
that's
correct.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
e.
marth
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
risk
comes
from
requiring
an
employee
at
that
early
stage
in
effect
to
give
up
or
minimize
his
later
meaningful
rights.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
well,
if
he
is
required
to
respond
with
more
than
an
exculpatory
no
in
effect
at
that
time,
then
there
is
that
risk
that
his
later
rights
would
be
deprived
of
him,
deprived
of
him
from
a
meaningful
point
of
view.
mr.
paul
e.
marth
no.
my
concern
is
that
before
a
person
has
a
right
to
see
an
attorney,
before
they
have
a
right
to
review
their
own
records,
before
they
have
a
right
to
look
at
the
government
charges,
it
risks
the
deprivation
of
those
rights
if
the
agency
can
come
in
and
question
the
employees
and
the
employee
does
not
have
a
right
simply
to
deny
the
misconduct
until
he
gets
those
rights.
at
that
point,
any
right
to
deny
the
misconduct
stops,
but
it's
only
after
he
gets
the
meaningful
rights
protected
to
that
employee
by
the
government
would
his
rights
continue.
thank
you.
