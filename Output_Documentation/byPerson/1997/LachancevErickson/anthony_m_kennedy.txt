m.

i
take
it
under
your
scheme
if
there's
suspicion
that
a
credit
card
has
been
misused
and
the
supervisor
said,
i'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
this
credit
card
problem,
the
employee
has
a
right
to
say,
i
decline
to
make
any
statements
on
that
unless
you
want
to
bring
charges.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
can
the
agency
separately
charge
for
noncooperation--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--and
failure
to
answer?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
but
not
under
your
scheme.
under
your
scheme,
the
employer...
the
employee
has
a
right
to
in
effect
be
silent.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
but
you're
not
denying
that
it's
permissible
to
remove
the
employee
for
failure
to
cooperate?
you
don't
deny...
you
don't
assert
that
there's
a
constitutional--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--prohibition,
do
you?
