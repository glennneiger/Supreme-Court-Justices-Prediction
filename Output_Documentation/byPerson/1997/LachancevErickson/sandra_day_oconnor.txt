justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
waxman,
just
for
purposes
of
discussion
and
not
to
indicate
my
view
on
what
the
court's
likely
to
do
in
the
preceding
case,
but
let's
assume
we
recognize
an
exculpatory
no
doctrine,
does
that
have
any
spillover
effect
in
this
situation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
guess
as
a
practical
matter
the
consequences
of
lying
about
the
situation,
if
you're
correct
in
this
case,
are
often
more
severe
than
the
underlying
malfeasance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
would
assume
that
could
often
be
the
case.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
right,
yes.
now,
the
federal
circuit
seemed
to
try
to
draw
some
line
between
the
types
of
statements
that
it's
doctrine
would
apply
to.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
a
line
i
don't
understand,
but
is
it
one
you
espouse?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
line?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
in
the
case
of
the
employee,
ms.
kye,
she
asserted
that
she
had
lost
or
torn
up
her
government
credit
cards,
and
yet
that
is
not
treated
as
a
false
statement.
how
do
you
draw
the
line
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
she
said...
she
went
beyond
that.
she
said,
i
lost
it.
i
tore
it
up.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
we're
not
dealing
here,
are
we,
with
criminal
charges
as
such.
they
may
have
done
things
that
could
result
in
criminal
charges,
but
that's
not
what
happened.
we're
talking
about
whether
there
should
be
some
employee
sanction
imposed
for
what
they
did.
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
what
we're
talking
about?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
this
court
has
never
imposed
some
kind
of
miranda
rights
scheme
in
the
context
of
looking
into
employee
malfeasance
or
misfeasance,
have
we?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
would
want
us
to
impose
something
like
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
miranda-type
scheme
for--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--employees.
well,
i
think
you
might
have
a
hard
time
persuading
us
that
we
ought
to
extend
that--
