justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--no
such
right.
but
were
they
told
that
what
you're
about
to
say
is
important,
and
if
you
lie
you
are
subject
to
criminal
liability,
or
the
equivalent?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
what
i...
the
difference
between
this
case
and
alger
hiss
illustrates
the
point
that
when
a
person
commits
perjury
he
is
put
under
oath.
it
is
made
clear
to
that
person
how
important
what
he's
about
to
say
is,
and
what
will
happen
to
him
if
he
lies.
people
when
they're
not
under
oath
say
all
kinds
of
things.
i
do.
you
may.
i
mean,
i
try
not
to
lie.
[laughter]
i
wouldn't
like
to
call
my
wife
in
to
say,
in
minor
matters
i...
you
know,
you
say...
well,
my
goodness.
so
there
is
a
problem,
but
i
don't...
i
see
a
problem,
and
to
that
extent
i
understand
your
point.
but
what
i
don't
see
is
how
to
solve
that
problem
within
the
context
of
the
law
that
we're
arguing
about,
and
if
you
can
find
a
way
to
do
that,
i
would
be
interested.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
yes--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
mean
a
legal
route
within
the
framework
of
the
law
we
are
discussing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
this...
this
is
a
minor...
but
i
mean,
it...
point,
but
it's
crucial,
i
guess
not
necessarily
to
whether
you
win
or
lose,
but
i'm
still
worried
about
whether
this
is
a
constitutional
or
a
statutory
case,
and
the
language
on
12a,
you
see,
they
say,
the
question
before
us
is
whether
doubling
up
a
misconduct
charge,
et
cetera,
deprives
the
employee
of
the
due
process
that
the
statute
intends,
and
then
they
talk
about
federal
law
throughout
the
rest
of
it,
and
they've
got
the
constitution
in
there
quite
a
lot,
but
i...
maybe
it's
the
same
answer.
i
don't
know.
but
is
this...
what
do
you
think
about
that
language?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
he...
they've
attached
7513
and
to
the
list
in
7511
and
they
say,
for
the
efficiency
of
the
service,
and
then
they
list
all
these
rights
and
they
say,
well,
obviously,
this
means
that
you
have
a
right
to
say
no,
and
certainly
during
the
hearing,
and
since
you
must
have
a
right
to
exculpatory
no
during
the
hearing
itself
you
have
this
reading.
yes,
it's
muscular.
[laughter]
