yes,
but
that's
because
it's
a
more
serious
thing
to
do.
it's
just...
a
cover-up
is
almost
always
more
serious
than
the
underlying
offense.
look
at
the
alger
hiss
case.
they
asked
him
in
1951
or
'50,
whenever
the
trial
was,
about
things
that
happened
in
1937.
the
statute
of
limitations
on
the
substantive
offense
had
run,
so
he
was
just
found
guilty
of
perjury,
so
lying
can
produce
an
offense
where
there
was
none
before.
that's
what
congress
has
said.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
waxman,
that...
none
of
that
was
necessary.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
even
if
he
was
put
in
a
room
and
asked
a
bunch
of
rapid-fire
questions,
it
seems
to
me
we've
got
the
same
answer
under--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
is
i
suppose
what
he
should
have
done,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
fact,
i
don't
suppose
she
could
even
say
i
don't
remember,
if
she
really
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
waxman,
you
would
not
be
happy,
i
don't
suppose,
with
a
decision
that
says
we
find
no
constitutional
basis
for
this
decision,
but
we
leave
open
the
question
whether
it's
commanded
by
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
it's
more
muscular
than
the
interpretation
of
the
due
process
clause?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
