oh,
but
that
simply
means
that
if
the
employee
refuses
there
will
be
consequences
for
refusal.
in
each
instance,
they're...
it
seems
to
me,
they're
in
the
same
position,
aren't
they--
justice
david
h.
souter
--public
and
private?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
that's
a
separate
charge
from--
justice
david
h.
souter
--the
charge
that
she
in
fact
lied.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
understand
that
your
theory
was
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation.
i
thought
what
you
were
concerned
with
was
a
very
sound
and
justified
deprivation,
and
that's
why
the
person
would
be
allowed
to
lie
a
little
bit
of
the
way
at
the
beginning
so
that
he
would
be
able
to
make
a
more
effective
defense
later
on
without
having
given
things
away.
justice
david
h.
souter
isn't
that
your
theory?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
it's
not
a
risk
of
erroneous
deprivation.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
it's
a
risk
that
his
later
rights
will
not
protect
him
from
a
justified
deprivation.
isn't
that
it?
you're
saying
if
he
can't
lie,
and
he
doesn't
remain
silent,
and
he
had
to
tell
the
truth,
he
wouldn't
have
much
of
a
case
later
on.
that's
your
concern,
isn't
it?
