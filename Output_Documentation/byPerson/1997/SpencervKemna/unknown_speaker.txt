unknown
speaker
it
does?
i
thought
that
if
you're
convicted
of
a
crime,
a,
then
under
the
guidelines
in
many
states
when
you're
convicted
of
crime
b
your
sentence
automatically
goes
up,
and
i
thought
that
wasn't
true
here,
that
if
your
parole
is
revoked
there
is
no
guideline
or
statute
that
says
you
get
an
increased
sentence
because
of
a
parole
revocation,
though
of
course
they
could
give
you
an
increased
sentence
on
the
basis
of
that
for
which
the
parole
was
revoked.
unknown
speaker
am
i
wrong,
because...
yes.
unknown
speaker
i
thought...
am
i
not...
what
i
was
saying
is,
i
thought
that
that
which
does
it
is
not
the
parole
revocation,
it
is
that
for
which
the
parole
was
revoked.
in
other
words,
the
defendant
would
always
have
a
chance
to
say,
but
i
didn't
do
this
thing,
i
didn't
commit...
i
didn't
do
that
for
which,
and
then
the
parole
board
or
whoever,
the
court
would
consider,
did
he
do
it
or
didn't
he
do
it.
you
can't
do
that
if
you're
convicted
of
a
crime.
i
just
want
to
know
if
i'm
right.
is
that
right
or
not?
unknown
speaker
tell
me
if
i'm--
unknown
speaker
--all
right,
but
i
mean,
the
first
part
was,
is
that
right,
and
then
if
i'm
right,
then
why...
then
you're
going
to
explain
why
it
doesn't
matter.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
but
in
lane
v.
williams
we
said
that
the
same
factors
don't
apply,
that
the
parole
revocation
situation
not
becoming
moot,
we
limited
sibron
to
say
what
it
said,
the
legal
consequences,
and
said
that
some
of
the
other
consequences
that
you're
talking
about
did
not
prevent
it
from
becoming
moot.
you
really...
we
must
modify
or
abandon
lane
v.
williams
for
you
to
prevail,
must
we
not?
unknown
speaker
but
considerably
cut
back
on
it.
unknown
speaker
but
didn't
we
say
in
lane
that
consequences...
we're
talking
about
whether
something
becomes
moot.
the
consequences
that
didn't
have
the
same
effect
as
statutory
consequences
would
not
be
regarded
as
keeping
a
case
from
being
moot.
unknown
speaker
what
has
changed?
unknown
speaker
that
was
a
footnote
in...
on
a
point
that
wasn't
even
argued.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
tell
whether...
just
from
the
way
it's
put
in
a
footnote
you
can
tell
it
wasn't
argued.
unknown
speaker
well,
are
you
saying
then
that
whether
or
not
a
case
has
become
moot
may
depend
upon
the
seriousness
of
the
charges
in
the
parole
revocation?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
simon,
as
i
understand
it,
you're
concerned
about
the
stigma
as
it
would
apply
at
the
point
of
a
subsequent
parole
revocation.
i
would
suppose
that
the
stigma
that
you
refer
to
would
be
far
more
powerful
at
the
point
of
a
subsequent
decision
to
parole
in
the
first
place,
and
yet
that
does
not
seem
to
be
your
concern.
why
does
the
stigma
become
greater
when
he
has
been
paroled
and
the
question
is,
will
parole
be
revoked,
than
it
was,
or
seems
to
be
on
your
calculus,
at
the
point
at
which
he
would
be
subject
to
parole?
unknown
speaker
did
you
argue
them
in
the...
i
thought
your
argument
on
the
circuit
was
that
the
adverse
consequences
that
you're
concerned
about
are
adverse
consequences
at
the
point
of
a
later
parole
revocation.
was
i...
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
a
different
question,
if
i
may.
it
goes
back
to
what
justice
breyer
began
with.
i
take
it
you
accept
the
fact
that
at
a
later
parole
revocation
hearing,
at
least,
you
could
indeed
argue
and
present
evidence
to
the
effect
that
the
underlying
conduct
that
was
assumed
in
this
revocation
in
fact
didn't
take
place.
unknown
speaker
you
could
be
heard
on
that.
unknown
speaker
is
it
also
the
case...
do
you
assume
that
you
could
also
make
this
argument:
you
may
not
consider
the
fact
of
the
earlier
parole
revocation
as
such
independently
of
the
underlying
conduct,
because
i
was
doing
my
best,
i
had
done
my
best
to
litigate
that
by
means
of
habeas
at
the
time
i
was
released,
and
therefore
the
habeas
issue
became
moot
and
i
could
never
go
to
judgment,
so
therefore
you
shall
not
consider,
you
must
not
consider
the
parole
revocation
as
such.
that
argument
would
be
open
to
you,
and...
wouldn't
it,
and
wouldn't
it
be
successful?
unknown
speaker
mr.
simon,
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing?
i
thought
that
you
were
making
the
point
in
connection
with
your
client
that
it
wasn't
that
they'd
let
him
out
at
parole
and
then
it
would
only
be...
the
question
would
be
to
put
him
back.
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
reduction
of
his
chances
now
to
be
paroled
when
you
called
our
attention
to
the
guideline
in
missouri
that
says,
will
they
let
him
out
now
on
parole
when
he's
due?
not
if
there
appears...
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
reasonable
probability
that
he
would
live
and
remain
at
liberty
without
violating
the
law,
so
i
thought
you
were
talking
about
the
reduction
of
his
chances
of
being
paroled.
unknown
speaker
it
says...
can
we
take
the
case,
then,
that
there's
not
a
single
statute
which
attaches
adverse
consequences
to
parole
revocation
in
and
of
itself.
unknown
speaker
or
am
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
no,
there's...
i'm
sorry.
is...
that's
what
i
was
wondering.
there's
something
in
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
that
says
parole
revocation
itself
makes
a
difference?
in
and
of
itself.
unknown
speaker
no--
unknown
speaker
--what
i
mean
by
this
is
the
following,
and
i
think
maybe
justice
kennedy
means
the
same.
if
you
have
a
prior
conviction
and
then
you
come
up
for
sentencing
again,
that's
it,
you
know.
you
get
a
bump
up.
you
go
into
another
column,
or
you
get
an...
that...
all
that
the
judge
will
look
to
is,
is
there
another
conviction?
i
mean,
that's
basically
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
know.
that's
why
i
hesitated,
because
there
may
be
certain
things
you
could
attack.
unknown
speaker
yes.
yes,
that's
right,
exactly.
but
now,
parole
revocation
i
thought
was
different.
that's
why
i
started
with
this,
that
there
is
nothing
that
the
parole
revocation
in
and
of
itself
gives
you
a
bump
up
for.
rather,
a
judge
would
look
at
it
and
say,
hmm,
his
parole's
been
revoked.
i
wonder...
that
doesn't
look
good
to
me.
i
wonder
what
that's
for,
and
then
the
counsel
would
argue
about
it,
and
they'd
say,
you
know,
it
wasn't...
et
cetera.
you
see...
i
thought...
but
i
wasn't
certain
i'm
right,
and
that's
why
i
started
out
with
this.
unknown
speaker
no,
no.
unknown
speaker
you've
read
it
recently--
unknown
speaker
--you've
read
it
recently
with
this
in
mind,
and
so
i
raised
it
because
i
fear
i
could
be
overlooking
something,
which
is
why
i
raised
it.
unknown
speaker
15-year
window
for
what?
unknown
speaker
for
prior
offenses.
unknown
speaker
not
parole
revocation
as
such--
unknown
speaker
--for
prior
offenses.
unknown
speaker
these
all
assume
that
he's
going
to
commit
another
crime
and
be
judged
again
or
be
up
for
parole
again.
do
we
have
to
assume
that?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
those
are...
i'm
willing
to
acknowledge
that
people
have
those
choices.
i'm
not
willing
to
acknowledge
that
people
have
a
choice
whether
to
commit
a
crime
or
not.
i...
it
seems
to
me
rather
weird
to
say,
oh,
if
i
commit
another
crime
i'm
going
to
be
subject
to
these
adverse
consequences.
it
seems
to
me
the
proper
response
to
that
is,
don't
commit
another
crime.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
that.
that's
water
over
the
dam.
if
the
crime's
been
committed
we're
talking
about
whether
you
were
tried
fairly,
but
you're
talking
about,
oh,
if
i...
i'm
going
to
be
deprived
of,
you
know,
something
if
i
should
commit
another
crime,
and
i'm
not
willing
to
accept
the
hypothesis.
you
should
not
commit
another
crime.
may
i
ask
two
questions?
unknown
speaker
first,
isn't...
didn't...
this
man
actually
did
commit
another
crime,
didn't
he?
unknown
speaker
oh,
okay.
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
my
second
question,
then.
in
the
earlier
illinois
case
the...
conceivably
if...
it
would
not
have
been
moot
if
they
had
asked
for
another...
wanted
to
replead
and
stand
trial.
now,
supposing
in
this
case
the
state
takes
the
position
well,
we'll
admit
the
procedure
was
deficient
but
we
do
want...
since
he
wants
to
get
it
off
the
record
we
do
want
to
have
a
hearing
on
the
merits
of
the
charges.
would
that
be
possible?
unknown
speaker
you'd
have...
but
is
that
conceivable
in
the
way
this
thing
might
develop?
unknown
speaker
but
under
your
view
what
will
happen
if
you
win?
that's
what
i--
unknown
speaker
--to
say
that
it's
not
moot.
unknown
speaker
do
you...
you
said
the
sentencing
guidelines
regime
is
new.
do
you
put
in
part
of
the
different
picture
in
distinguishing
lane
heck
and
balisok,
which
wasn't
clear
what
the
1983
situation
was?
in
other
words,
is
there
a
way...
1983
is
not
available.
unknown
speaker
is
there
something
other
than
habeas
that
would
enable
you
to
expunge
what
you
say
is
this
unjust
blot
on
the
record?
unknown
speaker
there's
no
other
procedure
in
missouri
that
could
be
used
to
expunge
this,
to
get
a
hearing
and
to
expunge
it?
1983
is
a
federal
remedy,
but
no
state
remedy
at
all
to
question
a
parole
revocation
that
you
say
was
without
due
process?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
was
the
case
for
at
least
a
century
and
a
half,
wasn't
it?
i
mean,
you
speak
as
though
it
is
unthinkable
that
a
prisoner
should
not
have
a
hearing
in
federal
court
on
alleged
constitutional
violation
and
state
proceedings,
but
our
use
of
habeas
corpus
for
that
on
a
regular
basis
is
relatively
recent.
unknown
speaker
well,
they
didn't
amend
it,
but
what
do
you
think
in
the
congressional
statutes
dealing
with
habeas
corpus
reflects
a
congressional
desire
that
there
be
a
hearing
in
federal
court
for
every
asserted
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
in
state
criminal
proceedings,
or
parole
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
okay.
may
i
ask
another
question,
sort
of
on
the
question
of
mootness?
i
gather
you
do
not
question
the
right
of
the
state
to
retain
whatever
evidence
they
have
supporting
the
conclusions
that
they
led
to
in
the
parole
violations.
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
if
they
have
the
right
to
keep
the
evidence,
what
if
they
came
in
and
said,
well,
the
parole
violation
doesn't
mean
anything
in
terms
of,
as
they
basically
argued,
they
said,
therefore
we'll
take
it
off
the
books
but
we're
going
to
keep
the
information
in
the
file.
that
would
satisfy
you.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
why
they
don't
do
that
and
let
you
go
home,
because
that's
all
they
need,
it
seems
to
me.
unknown
speaker
when
he
comes
up
for
sentencing
on
some
new
crime.
unknown
speaker
but
that--
unknown
speaker
--that
invokes
justice
souter's
earlier
observation
that
at
that
point
he
says,
look,
this
was
an
improper
revocation,
you
go
from
there,
and
then
you
said
that...
i
think
that's
when
you
said
it
was...
occam's
razor
applied,
because
this
is
more--
unknown
speaker
--i
assume
because
this
is
more
complex.
it
seems
to
me
it's
much
more...
is
occam's
razor
a
precedent
we
cited
in
this
court?
i
haven't
seen
it
recently.
but
assuming
that
it
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
justice
souter's
solution
addresses
that.
it's
much
more
simple
to
wait
until
there
is
a
specific
harm,
and
then
talk
about
it,
as
opposed
to
saying
that
1983
is
available...
or,
pardon
me,
that
habeas
corpus
is
available
for
every
parole
revocation
violation
when
the
custody
is
terminated.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
it...
you
say
it
would
come
up
if
he
testified
in
an
automobile
accident.
do
the
missouri
courts
allow
impeachment
of
a
witness
on
the
ground
of
his
parole
was
once
revoked?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
unknown
speaker
i
know
your
time
is
almost
up,
but
are
you
relying
at
all
on
any
bad
faith
extension
of
time
in
these
habeas
proceedings
that
caused
the
thing
to
become
possibly
moot?
unknown
speaker
but
are
you
relying
on
the
fact
that
the
district
court
acted
improperly
or
in
bad
faith
or
anything
in
extending
the
time
after
which
he
was
released?
unknown
speaker
yes.
very
well,
mr.
simon.
mr.
layton,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
layton,
maybe
i
misremember
sibron,
but
i
thought,
unlike
the
first
case,
carafas,
or
whatever,
which
dealt
with
only
present
disability,
sibron
did
speak
about
future
problems
as
a
result
of
the
conviction,
like
being
impeached
as
a
witness.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
sure
i
follow
that,
because
isn't
it
as
a
practical
matter,
given
that
when
you're
put
back
in,
parole
is
revoked,
it's
not
for
a
very
long
time,
and
almost
in
every
case
you
couldn't
get
through
the
whole
process.
you
have
to
go
three
tiers
in
the
state
and
then
go
into
the
federal,
so
these
things
are
bound
to
be
moot,
aren't
they,
because
even...
you're
talking
here
about
district
court
delay,
but
that
wouldn't
be
enough.
you'd
have
to
go...
lane
didn't
become
moot
till
it
was
in
this
court,
right?
unknown
speaker
let
me
ask
you
something,
mr.
layton.
is
there
any
other
procedure
in
missouri
whereby
the
prisoner
could
get
some
kind
of
declaratory
judgment
or
any
other
relief
finding
that
he
was
denied
any
hearing
on
these
charges?
unknown
speaker
so
he
just
can't
get
it
litigated.
unknown
speaker
well--
--and
does
that
mean,
do
you
think,
that
prison
authorities
would
be
essentially
not
constrained
about
taking
arbitrary
action
against
a
prisoner
near
the
end
of
the
prison
term
because
the
whole
thing's
going
to
become
moot,
or
in
connection
with
any
parole
revocation
because
it's
likely
to
become
moot?
unknown
speaker
what
are
the
constraints,
if
you're
right,
and
we
have
some
bright
line
rule
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he's
going
to
lose
any
right
to
recover
in
1983
because
he
can't
get
a
successful
habeas
conclusion.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
layton,
what
about
the
state
challenges
on
state
habeas?
is
it
possible
to
tell
from
the
dispositions
of
those
cases
whether
the
missouri
courts
passed
on
the
merits
of
his
claim?
unknown
speaker
is
it
possible...
is
it
typical
in
a
missouri
habeas
proceeding
if
the...
say
the
habeas
court
expressed
a
view
on
the
merits,
to
simply
deny
it,
rather
than
say
it's...
write
it
out?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a...
probably
kind
of
a
stupid
question,
i
must
admit,
but
you're
arguing
that
this...
the
harm
to
him
is
so
trivial
that
the
case
is
moot.
i
suppose
the
benefit
to
the
state
must
be
fairly
minimal
also.
unknown
speaker
and
if
the
problem
arises
in
a
future
proceeding
you...
everybody
agrees
you
can
save
the
evidence
and
save...
just
as
you
save
charges
that
are
made
against
people
that
are
never
disposed
of.
you
keep
them
in
the
file
so
you
know
what's...
what
accusations
have
been
made.
i
mean,
i...
it
just
doesn't
seem
to
me
the
world
turns
on
the
outcome
of
this
case,
and
if
you...
even
if
you
should
lose,
it
seems
to
me
the
cost
to
the
state
is
pretty
minimal.
you're
just
say
whenever
one
of
these
people
file
these
out
of...
you
know,
these
old
cases,
we'll
just
say,
okay,
we'll
expunge
the
record,
we'll
keep
the...
but
we're
going
to
keep
the
evidence.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
would
hurt
you
very
much.
unknown
speaker
but
there
was
a
very
serious
charge
there
of
rape,
which
he
vehemently
denied.
unknown
speaker
the
problem
that
i
have
is
that...
let's
take
the
worst
case.
let's
say
that
parole
revocation
is
based
on
a
confession
that
the
defendant
made
because
the
prison
guard
put
him
on
the
rack.
even
so,
you
say
that
doesn't
matter.
he
has
his
chance
to
go
to
the
state
court.
they
just
denied
it
without
giving
a
reason.
his
time
ran
out
while
he
was
on
the
federal
side,
so
too
bad,
this
process
that
so
severely
violated
due
process
it's
a
wash.
he
has
no
chance
to
be
vindicated.
unknown
speaker
so
one
possible
thing
would
have
been
in
your
view
to
say
it's
moot...
to
bring
this
you
have
to
be
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
it's
a...
all
right.
so
we're
only
talking
about
the
cases
where
the
prisoner
was
in
custody
when
he
brings
it
but
he's
released
before
he's
finished.
so
in
those
cases
it
would
be
rational
to
do
one
of
two
things.
you
could
say,
the
habeas
is
over.
he's
no
longer
in
custody.
but
if
he
thinks
he
was
hurt,
he
could
bring
a
1983
action.
or
alternatively
you
could
say,
well,
you
don't
have
to...
you
can't
bring
a
1983
action,
but...
if
you're
hurt...
even
if
you're
hurt,
but
you
can
keep
pursuing
the
one
you
started.
unknown
speaker
but
now
where
we
are
is,
if
we
agree
with
you
here
we
are
saying
you
can't
do
either.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now--
unknown
speaker
--now
if...
and
starting
afresh...
let's
start
absolutely
afresh,
which
is
pretty
close
to
where
i
am.
i
read
the
statute,
and
it
says
that
in
a
habeas
case
you
must
be
in
custody,
and
then
you
can
ask
for
such
relief
as
law
and
justice
require.
unknown
speaker
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
now
we
know
at
least
in
some
instances
he
doesn't
really
have
to
be
in
custody.
he
just
has
to
have
been
in
custody
when
he...
that's
clear.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
now
he
says
how
could
it
be
moot
under
the
constitution
of
the
united
states,
because
i
was
in
custody.
that's
good
enough
to
start
this
thing,
and
i
would
like
such
relief
as
law
and
justice
require.
namely,
in
my
case,
law
and
justice
require
a
hearing,
after
which
there
will
be
an
expunging
of
the
record.
that's
what
he
wants.
that's
the
relief.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that's
what
he's
asking
for.
he's
asking
for
that
relief.
he
says
of
course
it's
not
moot.
i
haven't
got
the
relief
i
want.
that's
the
relief
i
want.
unknown
speaker
and
all
we're
debating
about
is
whether
he
should
want
it.
he
says
that's
up
to
me.
unknown
speaker
or,
unless
you
say...
there's
one
other
little
part
to
this,
because
i...
you'll
say...
maybe
you
could
say,
well,
the
relief
he
wants
under
the
circumstances
is
outside
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
didn't
mean
for
you
to
jump
there
yet--
unknown
speaker
--because
i
was
saying...
two
parts...
one
is,
why
would
the
constitution
stop
him
from
getting
the
relief
he
wants?
he
hasn't
got
it.
unknown
speaker
then
the
statutory
part.
unknown
speaker
what
we're
doing
here,
and
it's
really...
mootness
is
an
odd
word
to
use.
we're
saying
that
given
the
change
in
circumstance...
maybe
it's
the
right
word,
but
given
the
change
in
circumstance,
the
relief
he
wants
is
outside
the
phrase
i
quoted
in
the
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
couldn't
be
relief
that
law
and
justice
requires,
and
the
reason
it
couldn't
be
is
because
too
little
turns
on
it.
unknown
speaker
that's
your
argument.
or
you
could
say
that
he's
no
longer
in
custody.
unknown
speaker
no...
well,
we...
how
can
we
say
that
if,
in
fact,
in
other
cases
we've
said
that
a
person
who
is
no
longer
in
custody
can
bring
it?
unknown
speaker
yes.
yes,
if
one
goes
back
to
the...
if
one
wants
to
analyze
it
by
the
statute,
according
to
justice
breyer,
one
would
never
have
decided
carafas
or
sibron
the
way
they
did.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
in
lane
we
in
effect
said
that
if
he
had...
they
had
asked
for
relief
this
man
asked
for
it
would
not
have
been
moot.
unknown
speaker
they
were
asking
for
in
effect
an
enforcement
of
the
plea,
specific
enforcement
of
the
plea
bargain.
unknown
speaker
which
we--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
layton,
the
most
recent
expression
of
this
court
on
this
mootness
is
a
case
called
minnesota
v.
dickerson,
and
i
was
surprised
that
neither
brief
cited
that.
that
seems
to
favor
the
petitioner
here.
i...
do
you
know
what...
it's
at
508
u.s.
at
page
371,
footnote
2.
unknown
speaker
it's
that
long
footnote.
unknown
speaker
it
wasn't...
it
was
a
case
where
there
was
a
diversionary
sentencing
statute
so
that
there
was
no
conviction
on
the
record.
unknown
speaker
yes,
because
the
original
criminal
charges,
as
i
understand
that
case,
were
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
and
that
was
a
case
i
think
in
which
it
was
the
petitioner
that
was
seeking
to
have
it
dismissed
as
moot,
rather
than
the
state.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
layton.
mr.
simon,
you
have
4
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
but
you
didn't
cite
it,
so
that
suggested
to
me
you
didn't
think
it
was...
if
it
was
in
your
favor,
that
it
was
strongly
in
your
favor.
unknown
speaker
you're
not
saying
that
wouldn't
be
admissible
in
a
revocation
hearing,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
monday
next
at
ten
o'clock.
