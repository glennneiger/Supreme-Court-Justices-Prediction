mr.
james
r.
layton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:--
after
sibron,
lane,
and
the
footnote
in
evitts,
we
might
be
able
to
divide
collateral
consequences
that
are
alleged
to
defeat
mootness
into
three
categories.
the
first
are
those
that
are
current
civil
disabilities,
those
that
led
to
the
decision
in
sibron...
can't
vote,
can't
serve
on
a
jury,
those
kinds
of
things.
a
second
category
are
the
ones
that
were
addressed
in
lane,
things
that
are
discretionary
that
we
can't
know
now,
for
example,
whether
a
past
parole
revocation
may
have
some
impact
on
a
future
parole
request,
or,
to
take
that
to
its
ultimate,
where
the
ninth
circuit
has
said
that
perhaps
a
sufficient
collateral
consequence
is
how
this
revocation
might
affect
someone's
chances
of
employment
in
the
future.
mr.
james
r.
layton
it
did
speak
of
those.
however,
all
of
the
precedents
that
sibron
cited
to
support
the
premise
that
it
could
draw
a
line
beyond
which
there
is
a
presumption
against
mootness
were
felony
cases.
every
one
of
those
is
a
case
that
involves
current
civil
disability,
so
sibron
is
not
clear
as
to
what
it
means
in
terms
of
what
kind
of
disability
today
would
be
sufficient,
but
the
tenor
of
sibron
is
there
is
a
conviction,
and
in
our
society
we
presume
when
there
is
a
conviction
that
there
are
some
effects
today,
as
opposed
to
other
kinds
of
things
that
may
happen
to
someone
as
a
result
of
our
judicial
system.
a
third
category
of
alleged
collateral
consequences
are
those
that
are
contingent
on
some
future
event,
although
they
may
not
be
discretionary
after
the
contingency
occurs,
and
that
leads
us
to
the
question
of
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
that
justice
breyer
was
asking
about
at
the
beginning
of
mr.
simon's
presentation,
and
that
are
addressed
for
the
first
time
in
this
respect
in
the
reply
brief
on
the
merits.
there
is
in
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines
a
provision
that
says,
we
will
give
points
in
criminal
history
for
all
of
the
convictions
where
the
incarceration
comes
within
the
last
15
years,
and
by
revoking
mr.
spencer's
parole,
mr.
spencer...
the
time
of
mr.
spencer's
conviction
or
his
incarceration
was
extended.
so
if
mr.
spencer
is
convicted
of
a
crime
between
april
16,
2007
and
august
7,
2008,
then
the
federal
guidelines
would
be
affected
by
this
parole
revocation,
but
not
otherwise,
and
i
think
that
shows
the
difficult
position
that
mr.
spencer
asks
this
court
to
take,
that
we
assume
that
it
is
enough
to
defeat
mootness
today
that
he
may
commit
a
crime
during
a
relatively
brief
period
in
the
next
century,
and
yet
that's
the
position
that
he's
taken,
that
the
ninth
circuit
has
taken,
that
that
kind
of
sentence
enhancement
is
sufficient.
the
consequences
mr.
spencer
alleges
fall
within
three
general
categories,
that
it
may
affect
a
future
parole
decision...
what
was
addressed
in
lane,
and
which
is
an
entirely
discretionary
decision
under
missouri
law...
whether
it
would
affect
him
at
trial
through
impeachment
or
perhaps
a
presentation
of
evidence
under
federal
rule
of
evidence
413,
or
whether
it
would
affect
his
sentencing.
and
then
comes
the
question
of
the
1983
action,
which
doesn't
really
fit
in
any
of
these
categories
of
collateral
consequences,
because
his
loss
of
a
1983
claim
is
not
the
result
of
the
parole
revocation.
it's
not
the
result
of
the
hearing
about
which
he
complains.
it's
the
result
of
his
failure
to
obtain
a
successful
decision
in
his
habeas,
or
a
state
or
a
federal
habeas,
and
i
think
there
are
three
reasons
why
the
court
should
resist
the
urge
of
mr.
spencer
to
adopt
the
position
that
a
1983
claim,
or
a
loss
of
the
1983
claim
would
be
enough
to
defeat
mootness.
the
first
is
that
it
is
too
far
removed
from
the
question
at
hand,
which
is
the
parole
revocation.
the
second
is
that--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i
think
these
things
are
bound
to
become
moot,
and
i
think
that
the
problem
mr.
spencer
has
where
he
suggests
that
he
is
unusual
somehow
in
losing
a
1983
claim
is...
well,
let's
present
a
hypothetical
about
mr.
spencer.
let's
suppose
that
his
state
remedies
were
not
exhausted
until
the
day
after
he
was
reparoled.
he
wouldn't
have
a
1983
claim,
not
because
of
anything
the
state
had
done,
but
because
it
just
took
a
while
for
that
process
to
happen.
and
yet
he
suggests
here
the
court
ought
to
announce
a
new
rule
that
because
of
the
timing
of
his
case,
somehow,
if
we
have
a
1983
claim
it
will
be
lost,
the
case
is
no
longer
moot.
now,
one
of
the
things
that
that
does
is,
it
would...
to
adopt
that
would
endorse
the
position
that
mr.
spencer
can
come
before
this
court
and
raise
that
issue
for
the
first
time.
in
his
brief
he
wonders
how
the
eighth
circuit,
with
its
own
precedent
of
leonard
v.
nix,
could
have
reached
the
decision
that
it
did,
given
the...
a
loss
of
a
1983
cause
of
action.
well,
the
reason
is
because
he
never
raised
the
question
of
a
1983
cause
of
action
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
so
for
this
court
to
adopt
that
would
be
to
endorse
the
premise
that
all
of
these
collateral
consequences
save
one,
which
were
raised
for
the
first
time
in
this
court...
in
fact,
for
the
first
time
generally
in
the
reply
to
the
cert
petition...
that
that's
the
way
that
someone
should
operate.
you
can
do
these
things
late.
i
think
the
third
reason
why
the
court
should
not
adopt
the
premise
that
a
198...
loss
of
a
1983
cause
of
action
is
sufficient
to
prevent
mootness
is
that
that
would
in
effect
move
the
sibron
presumption
from
just
covering
habeas
petitions
that
challenge
convictions
to
covering
essentially
all
habeas
petitions,
because
what
habeas
petitioner,
if
the
court
were
to
so
rule,
is
going
to
resist
the
urge
to
say,
oh,
i
have
a
1983
cause
of
action,
and
so,
judge,
you
can't
dismiss
my
case.
mr.
james
r.
layton
perhaps
not,
justice
o'connor.
the
appropriate
method
would
have
been
through
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus,
which
he
pursued.
it
may
be
possible
for
him
to
enter
into,
or
attempt
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandamus,
or
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
but
we
know
of
no
instance
in
which
a
person
in
his
situation
has
attempted
that.
mr.
james
r.
layton
he
cannot
get
it
litigated
in
the
context
of
this
case.
mr.
james
r.
layton
no.
the--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--section
1983
provides
a
constraint.
it
just
doesn't--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--well,
he
loses
his
1983
claim.
mr.
james
r.
layton
but
if
the
state
had
a
policy
or
program
or
practice
of
doing
what
your
honor
says,
then
he
would...
could
have
a
1983
claim
to
stop
that
practice,
not
to
question
his
own
determination,
but
to
stop
that
practice,
and
he
would
have
an
incentive
to
do
that,
since
he's
already
incarcerated
again,
and
although
he's
been
given
a
new
parole
date
on
his
new
sentence,
he
has
yet
to
be
paroled,
and
so
he
could
do
that.
mr.
james
r.
layton
in
each
instance
the
petition
was
denied
without
explanation,
and
so
it
is
impossible
to
do
more
than
assume
that
they
were
ruling
on
the
merits,
with
the
possible
exception
of
the
intermediate
court,
where
he
used
the
wrong
writ,
although
the
missouri
practice
is,
even
when
a
lawyer
presents
the
wrong
writ,
is
to
simply
assume
that
the
lawyer
intended
a
different
writ.
mr.
james
r.
layton
it
is
very
unusual
in
missouri
practice
for
the
denial
of
any
writ
to
come
with
an
opinion.
in
fact,
i
have
yet
to
see
that
in
my
own
experience.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i
don't
know
that
that
is
a
stupid
question,
because
it's
something
that
i've
considered
carefully.
in
pennsylvania
v.
mims,
where
the
question
before
this
court
was
also
mootness,
but
mootness
where
the
state
wanted
to
continue
litigating
the
case,
the
court
said
that
it
was...
well,
the...
justice
marshall
in
a
sense
said
it
was
barely
not
moot
because
the
state
had
an
interest
in
some
future
sentencing.
here
we
aren't
even
to
that
point.
it's
hard
to
imagine
what
great
incentive
there
is
going
to
be
for
the
parole
board
if
mr.
spencer
is
now
before
the
board
and
has
been
told
the
board
is
to
give
him
a
new
hearing.
why
does
the
board
care
whether
they
give
him
a
new
hearing
or
not
at
this
point?
he's
already
served
on
his
revocation.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well,
i
think
that
that
is--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i
think
that
would
be
true
if
all
cases
were
like
mr.
spencer's,
but
of
course,
if
this
court
announces
a
rule
that
extends
the
breadth
of
collateral
consequences,
then
we
will
be
litigating
more
cases
further
in
the
district
courts
and
the
courts
of
appeals,
and
that
is
our
difficulty
here,
is
not
so
much
what
our
disagreement
is
with
mr.
spencer,
as
where
we
would
be
if
this
court
announced
a
different
rule.
in
fact,
i
doubt
that
with
mr.
spencer
the...
this
would
have
any
impact
at
all.
it's
notable
that
mr.
spencer
at
no
point
through
the
process
of
the
parole
hearings
denied
possession
of
cocaine,
and
twice
before,
since
the
time
he'd
first
left
prison,
he'd
been
found
with
cocaine,
and
so
it's
unlikely
that
he
would...
his
parole
revocation
would
be
any
different
even
if
he
were
limited--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--yes.
yes,
he
did
deny
that.
he...
at
the
original
interview
he
admitted
to
consensual
sex,
but
denied
that
it
was
rape.
he
admitted
to
pushing
the
woman
down,
but
denied
it
was
rape.
mr.
james
r.
layton
that
is
the
result
of
the
court's
holding
in
heck
v.
humphrey.
not
the
result
of
the
holding
here,
but
in
heck
v.
humphrey.
because
as
i
said
before,
mr.
spencer
would
be
in
the
same
situation
under
heck
v.
humphrey
if
he
couldn't
complete
his
state
remedies...
if
he
couldn't
complete
his
state
remedies
by
the
time
he
filed
a
federal
habeas,
then
he
couldn't
assert
a
cause
of
action
in
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
poses
regardless
of
how
the
court
rules
here,
so
there
would
still
be
people
in
that
situation,
unable
to
obtain
a
federal
forum
in
which
to
litigate
their
claim.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
those
are
both
logical,
but
the
third--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--that's
right.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i
think
that's--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
that's
the
way
that
the
statute--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--but
the--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--but
to
say--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--the
same--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i
believe
it
is.
i...
the
same
kind
of
situation--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--okay--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--well,
i
don't
know
that
the--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i
don't
know
that
the
constitution
does
stop
him
from
getting
the
relief
he
wants.
the
question
here
is
not
his
constitutional
right
but
his
statutory
right,
either
under
the
habeas
statute
or
1983,
and
so
this
court
has
interpreted
1983
not
to
give
relief
to
someone
in
this
man's
situation,
and
so
it's
not
a
constitutional
right--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--correct.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
yes,
you
could
take
that
approach.
mr.
james
r.
layton
i
think
that
justice
breyer
presents
the
problem.
mr.
james
r.
layton
it's
certainly
possible
to
go
to
where
justice
thomas
led
in,
i
believe
it's
the
heck
decision,
and
not
have
any
of
these
problems,
but
we
aren't
there
today,
and
today
we're
in
the
presence
of
the
lane
decision
that
says
that
when
the
future
consequences
are
discretionary,
when
they're
speculative,
when
they
require
certain
intervening
steps
before
there's
some
kind
of
relief,
that
we
aren't
going
to
recognize
that
the
case
continues
after
custody
in
those
situations.
so
the
court
doesn't
have
to
go
nearly
that
far
in
order
to
reach
the
conclusion
that
it
ought
to
reach
today.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well,
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
i
think
that
the
lane...
that
at
least
the
way
i
read
the
decision
the...
what
you...
the
court
was
suggesting
was
that
they'd
asked
about
the
original
conviction,
and
so--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--yes.
mr.
james
r.
layton
if...
if
we
treat
the
parole
revocation
as
the
direct
equivalent
of
a
conviction,
then
that's
correct,
but
we
haven't
treated
parole
revocations
as
the
direct
equivalent
of
convictions,
and
i
think
the
reasons
have
come
out
this
afternoon,
that
they
don't
come
accompanied
by
the
same
kind
of
consequences,
at
least
under
missouri
law.
now,
it
may
be
that
we
would
be
in
a
different
situation
if
we
were
in
a
state
such
as,
i
believe
new
hampshire,
where
after
you've
been
revoked
once,
you
never
can
get
parole
again,
but
we
aren't
in
that
situation.
all
of
these
kind
of
disabilities
or
consequences
that
we're
talking
about
are
remote
and
contingent.
mr.
james
r.
layton
well--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i
know
the
footnote.
i
will
confess
that
i
have
studied
it,
but
i
am
not
at
the
moment
recalling
exactly
why
i
didn't
think
that
i
would
read
it
in
the
petitioner's
favor.
it
certainly
does
follow
along
from
sibron,
lane,
and
evitts,
but
i
don't
think
would
read
to...
could
be
read
fairly
to
hold
in
petitioner's
favor
here.
mr.
james
r.
layton
that's
right,
and
there
was
a
reference
in
the
case
to
collateral
legal
consequences,
and
they
were
of
the
sort
that
are
contingent
in
my
three
part
classification
that
is--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--i
believe
that
that
is
right,
although
the
dismissal
itself
i
think
is
at
issue
there.
i
don't
think
that
it
comes
up
under
habeas,
and
so
it
doesn't
incur
the
habeas
problems
that
we
have
here,
but--
mr.
james
r.
layton
--that
may
be,
plus
the
minnesota
statute
said
that
a
conviction
after
a
successful
probation,
although
not
a
conviction
for
future
purposes,
can
be
used
in
calculating
a
criminal
history
category
under
minnesota
law,
but
there's
nothing
in
that
decision
to
suggest
that
the
same
would
be
true
even
under
minnesota
law
for
a
parole
revocation.
again,
it
addresses
a
conviction
and
not
a
parole
revocation,
and
that
becomes
a
critical
distinction
as
long
as
we
attach
to
convictions
certain
mandatory
civil
disabilities
or
consequences.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
