mr.
john
w.
simon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:--
in
september
1992
the
state
of
missouri
revoked
randy
spencer's
parole
on
the
basis
of
the
board
of
probation
and
parole's
finding
that
he
had
committed
forcible
rape,
armed
criminal
action,
and
possession
of
crack
cocaine.
after
exhausting
his
state
remedies,
spencer
filed
a
federal
habeas
corpus
action
asserting
federal
constitutional
violations
concerning
this
revocation
which
would,
if
recognized,
have
required
the
court
to
hold
it
invalid.
about
4
months
after
spencer
filed
his
petition,
the
state
released
him
on
parole
again
for
good
behavior,
but
without
expunging
the
order
of
revocation
or
abandoning
its
finding
that
he
was
guilty
of
these
three
serious
felonies.
nearly
2-1/2
years
after
he
filed
his
petition,
the
district
court
dismissed
it
as
moot.
in
conflict
with
the
decisions
of
every
other
united
states
court
of
appeals
that
had
then
issued
a
published
opinion
dealing
with
the
subject,
the
court
below
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal.
an
official
governmental
finding
that
one
is
guilty
of
forcible
rape,
armed
criminal
action,
and
possession
of
crack
cocaine
has
collateral
consequences
like
those
of
a
criminal
conviction
per
se.
mr.
john
w.
simon
justice
breyer--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--justice
breyer,
i've
two
responses
to
that.
the
first
is
that
although
it
is
not
automatic
in
the
case,
it
is
not
automatic
that
under
the
guidelines
you
would
get
it...
you
would
get
a
higher
sentence
solely
on
the
basis
of
the
parole
revocation,
the
parole
revocation
can
force
one's
offense
into
the
15-year
window--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--i
agree
with--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--i
agree
with
what
you're
saying,
justice
breyer,
but
in
sibron
this
court...
this
court
considered
that
question
in
respect
to
criminal
convictions--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--well...
yes.
thank
you,
your
honor.
you
are
right.
you
are
right
in
that
the
parole
revocation
does
not
have
exactly
the
same
effect
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
as
a
criminal
conviction.
however,
to
put
the
burden
on
the
petitioner
and
then
defendant
in
the...
under
the
guidelines
of
impeaching
the
parole
revocation
years
after
the
fact
has
the
same
things
wrong
with
it
that
it
would
have
in
the
sibron
situation,
where
this
court
said
that
we
shouldn't
require
people
to
come
in
years
after
the
fact
when
they
have
proceeded
to
litigate
the
claims
under
the
rules
as
sibron
and
randy
spencer
have
done.
mr.
john
w.
simon
certainly
not
abandon,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
w.
simon
i'm
not
even
sure
of
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
lane
is
distinguishable
on
numerous
grounds.
the
prisoners
there
neither
challenged
their
parole
revocations
nor
sought
relief,
nor
put
the
consequences
of
those
revocations
at
issue
by
seeking
expungement
of
their
records.
the
target
in
lane
was
the
guilty
plea
way
back
when,
not
the
parole
revocation.
they
were
seeking
relief
from
what
they
contended
to
be
an
involuntary
guilty
plea.
if--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--correct,
your
honor.
however,
things
have
changed
since
lane.
mr.
john
w.
simon
well,
first
of
all
the
court's
doctrine
on
that
has
changed,
because
in
evitts
the
court
added--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe...
well
now,
of
course,
your
honor,
i
wouldn't
know
whether
it
was
argued.
the
court
would
know
that.
mr.
john
w.
simon
your
honor,
the
material
that
is
most
damaging
to
my
client
in
lane
is
also
in
a
footnote.
the
question
is
what
the
court
held
in
lane
and
in
evitts,
rather
than
the
typography
of
where
the
points
appeared
and
in
lane,
the
question
that
my
client
is
asking
the
court
to
decide,
this
wasn't
before
the
court,
because
in
lane
the
prisoners
did
not
argue
that
the
state
of
illinois
had
violated
their
federal
constitutional
rights
as
explained
in
morrissey
and
gagnon.
the
target
was
just
different,
your
honor.
i
know
the
language
is
there,
but
not
only
were
the
facts
different
in
lane
and
the
procedural
posture
was
different,
but
lane
predated
evitts'
addition
of
sentence
enhancement
and
testimonial
impeachment
to
the
list
of
collateral
consequences
and,
furthermore,
one
of
the
things
the
court
relied
on
in
lane,
as
far
as
the
reader
can
tell,
is
the
speculative
nature
of
what
was
going
to
happen.
and
it's
my
position,
your
honor,
that
the
consequences
of
that,
of
a
parole
revocation,
especially
a
serious
one
like
this,
one
sex
offense,
one
weapons
offense,
one
drug
offense,
the
consequences
of
these
are
far
more
powerful--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--only
if
the
court
chooses
to
apply
sibron
to
parole
revocations,
your
honor.
if
the
court
goes
on
a
case
by
case
basis
and
just
says,
well,
in
this
case
it's
forcible
rape,
armed
criminal
action,
and
possession
of
crack
cocaine,
well,
we're
going
to
hold
that
it's
not
moot,
if
the
court
feels
that
that
would
be
unmanageable
because
courts
would
have
to
decide
it
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
the
court
could
apply
the
sibron
presumption.
my
client
wins
either
way
because
of
the
grossly
stigmatic
characteristics
of
the
felonies
that
he's
been
found
guilty
of
without
a
trial.
mr.
john
w.
simon
your
honor,
we
have
been
a
little
more
soft
spoken
about
the
parole
consequences
per
se,
but
we
have
never
abandoned
them,
and
they--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--i...
your
honor,
i
am
not
sure
about
where
the
focus
of
it
was,
except
that
in
the
eighth
circuit
the
focus
was
on
the
parole
consequences
as...
and
to
the
exclusion,
i
will
concede,
of
later
consequences
such
as
sentence
enhancement.
mr.
john
w.
simon
yes.
mr.
john
w.
simon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
simon
your
honor,
if
i
were
representing
mr.
spencer
on
that
hypothetical
case
i
would
certainly
make
the
argument
that
you're
suggesting,
justice
souter.
however,
i
think
that
occam's
razor
would
tell
us
that
we
should
recognize
collateral
consequences
before
we
require
counsel
or
particularly
the
pro
se
parole
candidate
to
make
an
argument
that
intricate,
and
i
agree
that
it
is
an
intricate
argument
that
a
resourceful
counsel
who
is
sitting
here
with
us
today
would
make.
mr.
john
w.
simon
justice
ginsburg,
the
guideline
that
you're
quoting
is
from
the
missouri
sentencing
guidelines
rather
than
their
parole
guidelines.
we
acknowledge
that
it's
discretionary
with
the
board
how
much
weight
the
board
should
give
to
this
parole
revocation
in
the
board's
decision,
but
i
believe
that
what
the
court
was
just
quoting
was
a
document
for
the
use
of
missouri
courts
in
passing
sentences.
mr.
john
w.
simon
no,
your
honor,
we
can't--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--we
can't
take
that
because
of
the
15-year
window
under
the
federal
sentencing
guidelines.
mr.
john
w.
simon
well,
it's...
i
guess
it
depends
on
what
we
mean
by
in
and
of
itself.
mr.
john
w.
simon
consequences.
mr.
john
w.
simon
you
can't
attack
it
anyway?
mr.
john
w.
simon
no
counsel,
for
example.
mr.
john
w.
simon
well,
justice
breyer,
for
me
to
advise
you
on
the
kinds
of--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--sentencing
guidelines--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--is
like
bringing
coals
to
newcastle.
mr.
john
w.
simon
your
honor,
the
big
picture
in
respect
to
the
sentencing
guidelines
is
that
before
the
sentencing
guidelines
were
authorized
and
adopted
a
federal
sentencing
court
had
virtually
unbridled
discretion.
5
years
to
life
could
mean
anything
in
between.
but
under
the
guidelines,
the
amount
of
discretion,
the
scope
of
the
sentencing
judge's
discretion
has
been
cabined,
and
one
of
the
factors
that
goes
into
that
at
various
points
is
the
15-year
window,
concerning
which
it
does
definitely
have
an
effect
and
there's
no
wriggling
out
of
it.
mr.
john
w.
simon
for
a
previous
incarceration,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
w.
simon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
simon
not--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--not
as
such,
your
honor,
but
the
parole
revocation
makes
a
difference
in
the
15-year
window.
but
the
big
picture,
members
of
the
court,
is
that
the
sentencing
guidelines
have
narrowed
that
window
of
discretion.
it's
been
a
sea
change
in
criminal
sentencing
in
the
federal
courts,
and
the
parole
revocations--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--no,
your
honor,
because
of
the
other...
because
of
the
other
factors.
when...
this
does
not...
this
argument
for
collateral
consequences,
whether
as
applied
to
parole
revocations
or
criminal
convictions,
does
not
assume
that
the
person
is
going
to
go
out
and
commit
another
crime.
everything,
all
of
the
factors
that
the
court
has
relied
on
in
carafas,
in
evitts,
wherever
the
court
has
talked
about
collateral
consequences,
there
is
some
intervening
act,
some
intervening
decision
that
the
person
burdened
by
the
collateral
consequences
must
make.
one
thing
that
everyone
agrees
on
as
a
collateral
consequence
is
jury
service.
whether
a
person
is
kept
from
serving
on
a
jury
because
he
or
she
is
a
convicted
felon
is...
depends
on
whether
they're
called
for
jury
duty,
whether
they
come
up
with
some
excuse
in
advance,
whether
they
want
to
serve
on
the
jury.
that
depends
on
intervening
choices.
the
right
to
vote
depends
on
intervening
choices.
mr.
john
w.
simon
agreed,
your
honor,
and
there's
no
way
that
i'm
arguing
that
anyone
should
commit
crimes.
however...
however,
your
honor,
the
same
argument
would
cut
against
other
guarantees
of
the
rights
of
the
accused.
it's
always...
when...
it
would...
there
would
always
be
an
answer
to
a
criminal
defendant
who
seeks
to
overturn
his
or
her
conviction
by
saying,
well,
you
shouldn't
have
committed
that
crime.
you
wouldn't
have
a
problem
of
ineffective
assistance
of
counsel
if
you
hadn't
committed
the
crime.
mr.
john
w.
simon
yes,
justice.
mr.
john
w.
simon
he
committed
a
separate
crime
that
is,
we
would
submit,
only
marginally
relevant
to
what's
going
on
here.
mr.
john
w.
simon
it
was...
it
was
attempted
stealing,
nothing
to
compare
with
the
serious
sexual,
violent
weapons,
drugs
felonies
that
the
state
has
found
him
guilty
of
without
a
trial.
mr.
john
w.
simon
i
shake
hands
with
mr.
layton
and
we
go
home.
we
have
our
hearing.
mr.
john
w.
simon
theoretically
conceivable,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
simon
oh,
the
relief
we
would
ask
for,
your
honor,
is
a
remand
to
the
eighth
circuit
for...
with
instructions
to
remand
to
the
district
court
to
allow
the
respondents
and
the
petitioner
to
litigate
the
merits
of
his
claims.
mr.
john
w.
simon
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
simon
mm
hmm.
mr.
john
w.
simon
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
my
client
exhausted
his
state
remedies,
as
he
was
required
to
under
preiser
v.
rodriguez.
then
he
filed
his
habeas
corpus
action.
he
can't
proceed
with
a
1983
until
his
habeas
corpus
action
has
been
not
only
litigated
but
victoriously
litigated
under
heck
and
edwards.
at
least
as
i
read
the--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--i
believe
that
his
appropriate
remedy
was...
in
the
state
courts
was
a
state
habeas
petition.
he
filed
successive
petitions
in
the
three
levels
of
missouri
courts
and
lost
and
then
went
to
federal
court,
and
your
honor,
i...
if
there
is
another
procedure,
first
of
all
i'm
not
aware
of
it
and
second,
i
believe
that
my
friends
here
from
the
state
would
argue
that
it
was
not
appropriate
and
that
it
was
a
frivolous
inmate
filing.
so
it...
heck...
but
to
go
back
to
your
point,
justice
ginsburg,
heck
and
edwards
are
very
important
to
this,
because
it
means
that
if
my
client
loses
on
the
mootness
point
and
the
court,
the
federal
district
court
cannot
address
the
merits
of
this,
then
he's
boxed
out
of
any
federal
remedy
at
all.
he
is
simply
stuck
with
this
unconstitutional
parole
violation
that
brands
him
as
a
forcible
rapist.
mr.
john
w.
simon
agreed,
your
honor.
the
question
is
whether
this
court
and
congress,
as
the
two
key
decisionmakers
in
this
area,
want
that
result
to
happen,
and
congress...
congress,
as
we
all
know,
has
recently
revisited
habeas...
federal
habeas
corpus
at
the...
almost
simultaneously
they
revisited
1983
in
pilra,
and
in...
the
congress
considered
these
things
very
seriously.
they
considered
them
after
the
majority
of
the
circuits,
eight
circuits
by
my
count,
had
held
that
claims
like
my
client's
were
not
moot,
and
they
didn't
amend
2254.
mr.
john
w.
simon
every?
none,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
simon
no,
your
honor.
i
think
they'd
better
do
that.
mr.
john
w.
simon
we
go
home,
your
honor.
mr.
john
w.
simon
well,
your
honor,
the
respondents
are
on
the
horns
of
a
dilemma,
because
they're
arguing
here
that,
oh,
this
is
just
a
parole
revocation.
it
doesn't
mean
anything.
and
yet
when
he
comes
up
for
sentencing
there'll
be
some
assistant
prosecuting
attorney
who's
going
to
be...
you
know,
arguing
to
the
court
that
he's
the
worst
thing--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--or,
your
honor,
when
he
is
the
victim
in
an
automobile
accident
and
has
to
testify--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--to
get
his
medical
expenses
paid.
mr.
john
w.
simon
parsimonious.
mr.
john
w.
simon
your
honor,
i
thought
that
the
court
had
crossed
that
bridge
in
sibron,
and
my
question
is,
if
it...
if
sibron
is
right
on
that
point,
that
we
shoot
it
out
closer
in
time
to
the
transactions
and
occurrences
involved
in
the
case,
which
is
what
the
respondents
normally
want
to
do
in
collateral
attacks,
is
litigate
things
closer
in
time
while
the
witnesses
are
still
alive,
they're
still
around,
the
blood
samples
are
fresh,
what
not,
why
doesn't
it
work
when
it
cuts
in
the
petitioner's
favor?
and
as
to
the...
as
to
litigating
it
in
a
civil
trial,
that...
see,
they
just
multiply
the
number
of
times--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
two
sides
have
cited
all
of
the
missouri
cases
on
that,
and
that
the...
as...
they
argue
one
side,
we
argue
the
other.
it's
our
position
that
as
long
as
one
asks
the
question
correctly,
you
can
get
that
in,
and
we'd
refer
to
the
newman
and
comstock
cases
on
that.
mr.
john
w.
simon
please,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
john
w.
simon
well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
in
no
way
are
we
relying...
are
we
asserting
that
this
man
is
entitled
to
relief
on
account
of
the
delay,
only
that
he's
entitled
to
a
day
in
court.
we
are
concerned
that
this
would
send
a
message--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--no,
your
honor,
but
it
does
illustrate
the
risk
of
leaving
the
lower
court
decision
intact.
thank
you.
may
i
reserve--
mr.
john
w.
simon
thank
you,
your
honor.
first,
i
would
like
to
say
that
the
petitioner
agrees
with
the
respondent
that
the
question
here
is
statutory
and
not
constitutional,
that
it's
well
established
in
the
decisions
of
this
court,
acquiesced
in
by
years
of
congressional
revision,
coupled
with
inaction,
that
a
person
must
be
in
custody
when
he
or
she
files
a
petition
but
that
once
that
is
filed,
the
court
may
reach
the
merits
of
that
after
they
have
been
released
or
even
completely
discharged.
in
respect
to
the
minnesota
decision,
members
of
the
court,
the
petitioner
owns
that
decision
and
did
not
feel
a
need
to
cite
it
with
specificity
by
virtue
of
a
reference
i
believe
i
made
in
the
reply
brief
to
the
cases
relied
on
by
the
amici.
mr.
john
w.
simon
i'm
sorry
if
i
didn't
cite
it
expressly,
your
honor,
but
we
would
own
it.
now,
it
would
allow...
it
referred
to
use
of
adjudications
in
future
proceedings.
it
was
rather
broad,
but
we
do
see
it
as
buttressing
our
position.
now,
with
respect
to
the
petitioner's
denial
of
his
drug
use,
i
would
refer
the
court
to
pages
89
and
90
of
the
joint
appendix,
paragraphs
33
and
34.
these
are
not
written
with
great
articulateness,
but
i
interpret
these
as
denying
the
drug
use
and
disagreeing
with
the
interviewing
officer
to
the
effect
that
the
petitioner
had
admitted
the
drug
use.
so
we
have
hearsay
within
hearsay
from
the
parole
officer
saying
that
the
petitioner
admitted
the
drug
use.
now--
mr.
john
w.
simon
--mr.
chief
justice,
hearsay
is,
of
course,
admissible
in
parole
revocation
proceedings.
we
don't
deny
it,
but
that
illustrates
the
slender
thread
on
which
this
revocation
hangs.
now,
the
respondents
have
presented
many
arguments
about
how
this
parole
revocation
isn't
very
serious,
how
this
parole
revocation
for
forcible
rape,
armed
criminal
action,
and
possession
of
crack
cocaine
isn't
very
serious,
and
on
some
of
them
i
have
to
agree
that
they've
scored
on
some
of
these
points
in
respect
to
this
particular
petitioner,
and
i'm
not
telling
this
court
that
every
single
reason
why
a
criminal
conviction
remains
live
after
release
applies
to
a
parole
revocation,
at
least
as
to
randy
spencer.
but
if
one
looks
at
the
big
picture,
it
is
just
absolutely
unrealistic,
bordering
on
disingenuous,
to
say
that
a
parole
revocation
by
the
state
of
missouri
for
three
serious
felonies
doesn't
matter,
that
it
doesn't
give
the
person
affected
by
it
a
substantial
stake,
that
gives
him
the
incentive
to
litigate
it
zealously.
in
missouri
we
like
to
ask
questions
on
voir
dire,
if
there's
any
member
of
the
panel
that
does
not
have
common
sense.
no
one
raises
their
hands,
and
so
you
say,
well,
judge
bandry
is
going
to
instruct
you
in
a
few
minutes,
that
you
just
need
to
apply
your
common
sense
in
this
case.
i
think
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
damage
that
this
does
to
this
man's
future
in
terms
of
testimonial
impeachment--
