mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
for
consideration,
in
a
nutshell,
is
whether
it
is
lawful
for
an
employer
and
a
union
to
agree
that
the
employer
shall
pay
the
wages
of
a
union
official,
or
union
officials,
for
their
services
as
union
officials,
where
the
union
official
used
to
be
an
employee
of
the
payor
employer.
our
position
is,
is
that
under
section
302
of
the
labor
management
relations
act
and
a
fair
reading
of
the
plain
language
of
that
statute,
such
an
arrangement
is
clearly
unlawful.
this
court
in
arroyo
many
years
ago
said
that
a
literal
reading
of
the
language
of
the
statute
does
no
offense...
does
no
violence,
i
believe
the
term
was...
to
common
sense
and
so
i
believe
it
is
useful
at
the
threshold
to
consider
for
a
moment
what
common
sense
would
suggest
is
the
answer
to
the
question
in
light
of
what
we
all
know
to
be
bedrock
federal
labor
policy
and
that
is,
is
that
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
ultimately
there
is
an
economic
interdependence
between
labor
and
management,
that
the
relationship
is
to
be
maintained
as
one
of
adversarial
independence.
in
light
of
that
fundamental
policy
that
has
been
expressed
by
this
court
on
numerous
occasions,
from
insurance
agents
on
forward,
to
ask
the
question,
is
it
lawful
for
an
employer
to
pay
a
union
official
for
his
services
as
a
union
official
is
to
answer
the
question.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
i
believe
that
the
statute
provides
that
an
employer
may
pay
for
the
services
of
that
individual
as
an
employee,
but
may
not
pay--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--for
the
hour
that
he
works
as
an
employee
of
the
employer,
but
for
the--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
i
believe
that
to
understand
whether
or
not
a
payment
is
lawful
under
a
no-docking
arrangement
one
must
go
to
the
safe
harbor
language
of
the
8
(a)(2)
proviso
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
is
from
whence
the
no-docking
provision
gets
its
genesis.
that
language,
that
section
says
that
notwithstanding
anything
else,
it...
an
employer
shall
not
be
prohibited
from
permitting
an
employee
to
confer
with
him
during
regular
hours
without
loss
of
pay.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
the
board
and
the
courts
have
extended
that
language,
rightly
or
wrongly,
to
include
conferring
with
each
other,
conferring
with
fellow
employees,
in
preparation
for
or
in
conjunction
with
conferring
with
management.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
if--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--again,
your
honor,
it
depends
on
the
nature
of
the
relationship.
if
a
steward
has
ceased
to
be
an
employee
of
the
employer
and
instead
become
a
full-time
agent,
or
to
the
extent
that
he
is
acting
as
an
officer
of
the
union--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--your
honor,
i
do
not
think
the
distinction
is
one
of
full-time
versus
part-time.
i
think
the
distinction
is,
is
he
being
paid
for
his
services
as
a
union
official,
which
is
unlawful,
or
is
he
being
paid
for
his
services
as
an
employee,
which
is
lawful.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
section
8,
the
proviso...
your
honor,
the
proviso
to
section
8
(a)(2)
creates,
in
our
view,
a
safe
harbor--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--which
allows
this
type
of
conflict.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
again,
your
honor,
in
our
judgment
the
distinction
is
not
the
issue...
the
issue
is
not
whether
the
individual
works
full-time
or
part-time.
if
you
look
at
the
statutory
language,
it
says
nothing
about
whether
someone
is
full-time
or
part-time.
a
full-time
union
agent
could
not
fall
within
the
ambit
of
the
8
(a)(2)
proviso--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--because
he
would
no
longer
be
an
employee.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
your
honor,
i
do
not
think
so.
i
do
not
think
that
working
for
a
few
moments
a
day
for
an
employer--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--that's--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--i
do
not
think
that
section
8(a)(2)
proviso
is
a
matter
of
the
amount
of
time.
i
believe,
and
we
argue,
that
it
is
a
function
of
the
nature
of
the
activity
that
the
representative
of
the
union,
the
employee,
is
engaging
in.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
the
analysis
would
be--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--my
answer
is,
is
that
you
go
to
the
statutory
language--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--and
under
302(c)(1)
he
cannot
be
paid
for
his
services
as
a
union
representative.
he
may
be
paid
for
his
services
as
an
employee
of
the
employer
in
a
dual
capacity
situation,
unless...
unless--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--you
then
go
to
section
8(a)(2)
and
if
the
nature
of
the
activity
falls
within
the
ambit
of
8(a)(2),
then
congress
has
allowed
a
safe
harbor
for
that
conduct.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
even
if
all
his
time
is
spent
on
that,
if
it
falls
within
the
ambit
of
section
8(a)(2).
so,
for
example,
your
honor--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--well,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--if
an
individual
is
spending
all
of
his
time
and
has
ceased
to...
has
ceased
to
engage
in
activity
on
behalf
of
the
employer,
he
is--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--no
longer
controlled
by
the
employer
and
doesn't
meet
the
control
test.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
to
the
extent
that
he
works
15
minutes
for
the
employer--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--he
is
an
employee
for
those
15
minutes.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
not
in
my
judgment,
because
with
regard
to
the
remainder
of
that
day,
what
you're
positing
here
is
a
situation
where
you
have
a
dual
capacity
employee.
he
is
a
agent
of
the
union,
similar
to
the
case
in
town
&
country,
and
he
is
an
agent
of
the
employer.
he's
an
employee
of
the
employer.
in
that
situation,
302(c)(1)
is
clear.
it
sets
up
a
dichotomy.
it
says
that
it
is
lawful
to
pay
a
union
official
to
be
an
employee
of
the
employer
but
it
is
not
lawful
to
pay
a
employee
of
the
employer
to
be
a
union
official
with
the
very
limited
proviso
that
if
you
can
fit
the
conduct,
if
you
can
fit
the
nature
of
the
activity,
regardless
of
how
many
hours,
justice
scalia,
within
the
confines...
and
they're
very
narrow
confines.
the
harbor
of
8(a)(2)
is
very
narrow.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
well,
those
were
the
facts
in
the
basf
case,
where
an
individual
was
a
part-time,
albeit
regular
union
official.
he
was
not
just
representing
his
fellow
employees
on
an
as-needed
basis
in
connection
with
particular
grievances.
he
was
performing
regular
representational
functions,
albeit
4
hours
a
day.
the
provision
in
the
contract
said
that
the
employer
could
pay
for
reasonable
time
spent
in
representation
of
employees
up
to
4
hours
a
day,
and
what
basf
was
complaining
about,
as
i
understood
the
facts,
is
that
this
had
become
de
rigueur,
that
every
day,
day-in
and
day-out,
this
was...
this
individual
had
become
a
regular,
albeit
part-time
union
official,
and
the
basf
felt
that
under
the
terms
of
that...
and
i
agree
with
basf
in
this
regard.
i
disagree
with
the
second
circuit
in
this
regard,
that
under...
that
where
that
individual
has
ceased
to
be
a
shop
steward
merely
conferring
with
the
employer
considering
grievances
on
an
as-needed
basis,
and
thus
fits
neatly
within
the
ambit
of
the
8(a)(2)
proviso,
when
the
representation
becomes
a
regular
full...
part-time,
albeit
part-time
representation--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--then
it's
prohibited
to
pay
that
individual.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
i
under--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--i
think
this
case
gives
a
perfect
example
and
i
direct
the
court's
attention
to
pages
4
and
5
of
our
reply
brief,
where
we
reproduce
the
two
provisions.
one
of
them
is
a
no-docking
provision
in
the
labor
contract
that
we
do
not
think
is
at
issue
and
we
think
it
is
perfectly
lawful
under
the
8(a)(2)
proviso
and
the
other
one
is
4.6,
which
we
do
not
believe
is
a
nodocking
provision
and
we
do
not
believe
is
lawful.
the
2.2
says,
your
honor,
stewards
may--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--i
am
reading
from
pages
4
and
5
of
the
reply
brief.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
well,
also
i
can
direct
your
attention,
your
honor--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--it's
the
middle.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
i
had
that
in
my
notes.
i
am
reading
now
from
the
middle
of
page
4,
the
quotation.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
in
short,
that
says...
and
that's
a
no-docking
provision,
2.2
of
the
local
agreement.
stewards
may,
without
loss
in
pay
for
regularly
scheduled
hours,
discuss
a
grievance
with
the
aggrieved
employer,
provided
the
aggrieved
employ--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--with
the
aggrieved
employee.
i'm
sorry,
your
honor.
provided
the
aggrieved
employee
first
informs
his
immediate
supervisor
and
also
with
the
employee's
supervisor
and,
if
the
grievance
is
not
satisfactorily
settled,
with
the
plant
grievance
committeeman.
that
is
a
classic
no-docking
clause.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
on
a
given
day,
your
honor,
it
might
be
the
case
that
he
would
spend
a
full
day--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--shop
stewards
have
regular
jobs
and
regular
job
duties.
shop
stewards
have
a
regular
function
that
they
perform
in
the
factory
which
they
come
off
of
and
they
return
to
upon
the
completion
of
their
task.
for
example,
if
the
2.2
provision
doesn't
ring
true
to
your
honor
in
terms
of
the
distinction,
take
a
look
at
the
1950
department
of
labor
sample
that
is
cited
in
appellee's
brief,
or
respondent's
brief,
i
should
say,
as
a
sample
of
a
classic
no-docking
clause.
i
read--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--it
is
in
the--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--they
just
cite
it.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
so
i
do
not
have
it,
but
i
am
reading
from
the
1950
bls
bulletin.
quote,
it
is
understood...
this
is
a
sample
clause
that
the
government
is
giving
as
an
example
of
the
no-docking
provision.
it
is
understood
that
stewards
and
grievance
committeemen
are
employed
by
the
company
to
perform
fulltime
production
and
maintenance
work,
but
it
is
further
understood
and
agreed
that
they
may
take
time
off
during
their
regular
working
hours
and
be
paid
at
their
regular
rate
of
pay
to
perform...
and
then
it
lists
investigate
and
present
grievances,
attend
meetings
for
the
discussion
of
matters
arising
out
of
the
application
of
the
agreement.
it's
an
example
of
what
a
no-docking
provision
is.
now,
justice
scalia,
this
may
be
a
matter...
ultimately
a
matter
of
degree,
but
matters
of
degree
are
as
real
in
the
law
as
matters
of
qualitative
distinction.
i
believe
that
that
type
of
provision
is
qualitatively
different
from
the
4.6
that
is
at
issue
here
wherein
the
employer
and
the
company...
the
employer
and
the
union
agree
that
the
chairman
shall
conduct
his
business
from
the
local
union
office,
he
shall
be
considered
on
leave
of
absence,
and
he
will
be
paid
by
the
company
for
his
regular
shift
hours.
however,
the
company
shall
not
pay
for
time
spent,
and
then
it
lists
a
couple
of
exceptions,
activities
not
directly
related
to
the
functions
of
his
office.
in
other
words,
this
individual
is
not
a
regular
worker
in
the
plant,
not
a
real
employee,
to
use
your
terminology.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
i
believe...
it
depends
on
what
you
mean
by
the
word
retain,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
one
can
retain
the
rights
that
have
already
accrued
to
that
person
while
they
were
an
employee.
for
example,
the
pension
that
has
been
earned
to
the
date
that
he
ceases
to
be
an
employee
and
becomes
a
union
agent.
he
can
retain
them,
and
he
can
draw
down
on
them.
he
can
be
paid
out--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--he
cannot
accrue
any
more.
seniority,
or
the
right
of
seniority
it
seems
to
me
is
nothing
more
than
holding
the
place
in
the
queue.
it
is
not
a
payment
of
money
or
a
thing
of
value
to
a
union
official.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
it
is
only
of
value
if
the
union
official
comes
back
and
becomes
again
at
some
point
in
the
future
an
employee.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
excuse
me?
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
in
this
case?
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
ah--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--this
is
the--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--i
will...
i
will--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--it's
an
important
question
and
the
bottom
line
is,
is
that
this
is
the
argument
that
there
are
various
types
of
contingent
benefits
for...
that
are
paid
to
an
employee
for
time
not
worked.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
well--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--let
me
go
back
to
the
first
one
for
a
moment.
the
difference
between
other
paid
time
off
provisions
and
this
one
is,
simply
speaking,
the
statute.
there
is
no
statute
that
prohibits
an
employer
from
paying
someone
to
go
on
sabbatical.
there
is
no
statute
that
prohibits
an
employer
for
paying
someone
to
go
on
political--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--well,
or
he...
or
in
this
case
he
used
to
work
for
the
employer.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
well,
and
the
phrase
by
reason
of,
your
honor,
is
nothing
more
than
a
prepositional
phrase.
the
important
issue
is
what
is
the
object
that
that
prepositional
phrase
takes,
and
the
object,
reading
the
literal
language,
is
service
as
an
employee,
or
his
service
as
an
employee
of
the
employer.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
i
do
not
believe,
and
i
believe
the
court
below
recognized,
that
there
is
anything
but
a
theoretical
benefit
that
the
employer
derives
from
these
individuals.
these
individuals
work--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--pardon?
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
i
thought
her
honor's
question
went
to
a
benefit
that
the
employer
receives
from
a
grievance
administration.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
in
our
judgment
that's...
in
theory
that
may
be
the
case,
but
it
is
irrelevant
if
it
is
the
case.
the
individual...
and
it
was
found
by
the
district
court
and
it
was
confirmed
by
the
appellate
court...
is
working
solely
and
exclusively
for
the
benefit
of
the
union.
now,
that
there
may
be
some
indirect
tangential
benefit
to
the
employer,
theoretical
or
otherwise,
does
not
mean
that
that
person
is
working
for
the
benefit
of
the
employer.
likewise,
that
individual
is
not
subject
to
the
control
of
the
employer
and
the
record
is
clear
below
that
everyone
who
has
looked
at
this
situation,
the
district
court,
the
appellate
court,
and
the
administrative
law
judge,
found
that
these
individuals
are
no
longer
employees
of
the
employer
and
have
become
employees
of
the
union
by
virtue
of
the
classic
test
for
that,
control
and
benefit.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
because,
your
honor,
congress
has
dealt
with
that
for
you.
let
us
assume
for

well,
your
honor,
i
mean,
we
may...
we
may
disagree
with
regard
to
the
plain
language.
i
think

has
very
plain
language.

in
passing
a...

if
you
do
not
think
the
language
is
plain
and
you
wish
to
go
to
the
legislative
history,
then
go
to
the
legislative
history
and
you
will
find
that
in
1935
it
was
proposed
that
the
language
have
within
it
an
exception
allowing
employers
to
pay,

local
union
representatives
and--
mr.
columbus

mr.

your
honor,
the
money
paid
to
a
former
employee
who
is...
again,
let's
say
had
a
workplace
injury
and
is
on
disability
and
is
entitled,
by
virtue
of
his
disability,
to
compensation,
can
be
paid
that
compensation
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
he
has
now
become
a
union
official,
because
it
was...
he
was
entitled
to
it
by
virtue
of,
by
reason
of
his
service
as
an
employee
of
the
employer.
mr.

for
his
services
as
an

mr.

pay
him
for
what?
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
i--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--my
response
is,
is
the
district
court's
response,
your
honor.
the
record
here
is
devoid
of
any
evidence
that
the
chairman's
wages
for
services
rendered
are
for
services
rendered
while
he
was
employed
at
caterpillar,
appendix
petition
61.
the
third
circuit,
the
chairman
does
nothing
for
caterpillar.
the
payments
at
issue
here
do
not
relate
back
to
these
former
employee
services
on
the
shop
floor,
page

of
the
petition...
appendix
to
the
petition.
it
is
difficult
to,
indeed,
to
comprehend
how
years
and
even
decades
of
paid
union
leave
can
realistically
be
thought
of
as
compensation
for
time
spent
on
the
factory
floor.
it's
even--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--well,
first
of
all,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
wide
industry
practice.
there
is
no
evidence
here
that
it
is
widespread
in
anything
but
the
auto
industry,
number
1.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
this
particular
employer
entered
into
this
arrangement
in
1973
under
threat
of
strike
and
has
had
it
for
five
or
six
contract
terms,
that's
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
think--
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
--i
think
that's
an
untoward
assumption,
that...
or
an
unjustified
assumption,
i
should
say,
your
honor.
it
is
very
easy
to
be
lulled
into
a
belief
that,
you
know,
if
you
pay
a
part-timer,
or
if
you
pay
a
shop
steward,
you
should
be
able
to
pay
a
regular
union
rep,
too.
that's
easy
to
fall
into
that,
to
be
lulled
into
that
sense
that
there
is
no
difference
when
in
fact
there
is.
and
then
one
day
you
wake
up
and
the
union
is
demanding
that
full-time
union
agents
be
paid
full-time
pay
at
54
hours
a
week,
at
top
rates
and
shift
premiums,
because
it's
time
they
got
a
raise.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
these
are
slippery
slopes,
your
honor
and
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
we
have
slid
down
it
necessitates
that
we
stay
at
the
bottom.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
virtue
is
virtue,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to...
with
the
court's
permission
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
columbus
r.
gangemi
the
bottom
line,
both
respondent
and
the
united
states
conflate
the
concept
of
service
with
the
concept
of
the
status
of
a
prior
employee.
the
statute
allows
the
employer
to
pay
for
the
services
of
an
individual
as
an
employee.
it
does
not
allow
the
company
and
the
union
to
agree
to
pay
someone
to
be
a
union
official
because
of
their
former
status
as
an
employee
of
the
employer.
the
statute
sets
up
a
clear
dichotomy.
you
can
pay
a
union
official
to
be
an
employee,
but
you
cannot
pay
an
employee
to
be
a
union
official,
and
it
makes
a
mockery
of
that
dichotomy
for
the
company
and
the
union
to...
or
for
the
union
to
argue
here
that
you
can
override
that
dichotomy
by
declaring
one
to
be
the
other,
by
declaring
service
as
an
employ...
service
as
a
union
official
to
be
and
payment
for
it
to
be
a
benefit
for
having
been
an
employee
of
the
employer
in
the
past.
it
collapses,
or
conflates
those
two
very
distinct
concepts
which
the
statute
recognized,
that
you
could
have
a
dual
capacity
employee.
