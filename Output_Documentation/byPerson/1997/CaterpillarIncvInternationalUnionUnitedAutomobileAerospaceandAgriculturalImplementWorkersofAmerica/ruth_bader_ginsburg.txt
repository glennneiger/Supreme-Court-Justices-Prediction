can
you
be
concrete,
then,
about
what
is
this
conduct,
because
you
seem
to
be
dividing
it
up
not
on
the
basis
of
number
of
hours,
but
conduct,
and
let
me
give
you
a
specific
example.
let's
take
the
job
of
grievance
settlor,
and
instead
of
giving
it
to
one
person
who's
called
the
chairman
to
do
it
full-time,
it's
given
to
two
shop
stewards,
each
one
working
4
hours
a
day
at
that
job
and
4
hours
a
day
at
the
plant
job.
is
that
arrangement...
shop
steward
works
4
hours
at
the
plant,
4
hours
settling
grievances,
two
of
them,
so
it
adds
up
to
a
total
of
8
hours
a
day,
are
those
two
shop
stewards
legitimately
within
the
no-docking
exception
that
you
derive
from
section
8(a)?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
that's
where--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that's
where
i'm
not
following
your
argument,
because
we're
talking
about
parties
bargaining
for
a
contract,
so
i'd
like
to
know
the
contract
term
for
which
the
union
and
the
employer
can
bargain,
the
nodocking
contract
term--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--that
you
would
say
is
legitimate,
and
you
can't
do
it
on
the
basis
of,
well,
when
it
becomes--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
can
they
negotiate
legitimately
for
any
retention
of
any
benefits
for
someone
selected
from
among
the
employees
to
do
this
job
for
a
term?
for
example,
how
about
retaining
the
right
to
return
to
work,
the
seniority
provision...
are
there
any
benefits
connected
with
employment
that
are
retained,
or
can
be
bargained
for
to
be
retained?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
not
accrue
any
more.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
on
the
difficulty...
on
the
difficulty
of
comprehending
that,
you
were
about
to
say
if
the
statute
is
ambiguous,
and
legislative
history,
does
it
count
for
anything
that
for
decades
in
the
industry,
it
appeared,
this
kind
of
arrangement
was
accepted.
for...
one
of
the
startling
things
about
this
case
is
that
you
are
coming
forward
and
now
saying
that
for
nearly
20
years
your
client
has
been
engaged
in
a
felonious
course.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
this
particular
employer
has
been
doing
it
for
nearly
20
years,
right?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there
must
have
been
some
kind
of
judgment
that
it
was
legal.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--the
government
was
taking
the
position
below
that
further
facts
needed
to
be
developed
and
then
there
was
kind
of
a
shift
up
here.
can
you
explain,
are
there
further
facts?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
so
if
this
chairman
was
spending
part
of
his
time
negotiating
the
bargaining
contract,
would
that
come
out
from
under
what
you
think
is
permissible?
