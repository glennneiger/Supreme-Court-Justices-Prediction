mr.
david
m.
silberman
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
discussion
to
this
point
i
think
has
made
quite
clear
that
there
is
no
principle
basis
for
distinguishing
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
provides
an
employee
who
assumes
a
union
position
part
time
off
to
perform
those
duties
from
one
that
provides
full
time
off,
and--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--well,
justice
souter,
first,
as
a
historical
matter,
at
the
time
the
statute
was
enacted
there
was
as
much
evidence
of
no...
of
payment
of
the
type
we
had
here,
where
it
was
recognized
that
an
employee
would
have
full
time
off
to
perform
certain
union
functions,
representational
functions,
as
part-time
positions.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
you
can
find
that
in
our
brief.
we
cite
the...
we
would
begin
by
reviewing
the
1941
ford
contract
with
the
uaw--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--which
is
the
agreement.
we
quote
that,
which
expressly
provides
that
a
full-time
position--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--it
was...
the
automotive
industry...
historically,
justice
scalia,
it
was...
the
industrial
unions
began
in
the
automotive
industry,
so
this
was
certainly
the
lead
industry.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
and
this
was
specific...
this
industry's
practice
was
specifically
called
to
the
attention
of
the
1947
congress,
both
the
ford
contract,
which
was
a
de
jure
full-time
contract
and
the
chrysler
contract
which,
as
we
explained
in
our
brief,
was
de
facto
full
time
in
that
employees
were
given
as
much
time
as
they
needed
and,
in
fact,
the
chief
steward
spent
full
time.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
i
was...
i
thought
i
understood
justice
souter
to
be
suggesting
that
a
distinction
could
be
drawn
between
part
time
and
full
time
based
on
historical
practice,
and
that
you
could
understand
the
statute
as
only
going
as
far
as
history
had
taken
it,
and
i'm
suggesting
that
that
doesn't
provide
a
basis
for
distinction.
obviously,
the
ultimate
answer
to
the
question
here
is
going
to
turn
on
the
language
and
structure
of
this
statute
as
informed
by
its
history.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
they
are
employees,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
they...
although
we
would
say
nothing
turns
on
that
in
terms
of
interpreting
this
statute,
we
think
the
correct
analytic
answer
is
that
they
are
employees,
and
they
are
employees
for
the
same
reason
that
an
employee
who
is
on
leave
to
take
an
educational...
pursue
a
college
education
or
is
on
sabbatical,
that
the
statute
defines
employee
for
the
purpose
of
302
it's
the
same
definition
as
for
the
purpose
of
nra.
the
labor
board
law
since
1935
on
has
been
very
clear
that
an
employee
who
is
on
leave,
as
long
as
he
still
has
some
right
to
return
and
hasn't
severed
all
employment
ties,
continues
to
have
the
status
as
an
employee.
he
can't
be
discriminated
against,
et
cetera.
so
we
think
if
anything
turned
on
it
these
people
are
employees,
but
since
the
statute
here
is
written
in
the
disjunctive
and
allows
payments
either
to
employees--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--or
to
current
employees,
i--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--that's
right.
we
would
not
say
they
are
currently
rendering
service
to
the
employer
as
an
employee,
but
if
the
question
is,
do
they
have
the
status
of
an
employee,
you
would
answer
that
in
the
affirmative.
but
as
i
say,
whether
they
are
employees
or
former
employees,
we
turn
to
this
statutory
language
and
the
statutory
structure
to
understand
the
structure--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--i
would
say,
justice...
the
statute
is
compensation
for
or
by
reason
of
his
service
as
an
employee.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
i
think
it
is
at
the
very
least
that.
compensation--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--that's--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--well--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--well,
he's
not
getting
pay
only
because
he's
working
for
the
union.
there
are
two
preconditions,
justice
scalia.
the
first
is,
of
course,
that
he
has...
he
is
an
employee,
has
rendered
service
as
an
employee,
and
then
this
is
a
form
of
contingent
leave.
he's...
as
an
employee
the
employees
are
entitled
to
paid
leave
under
certain
contingencies.
as
justice
breyer
pointed
out,
if
they
become
disabled,
if
they're
called
for
military
services
and,
in
this
case,
if
they
assume
a
union
position
they
are
entitled
to
a
paid
leave,
and
we
would
say
that
that
payment
is
payment
by
reason
of
service
as
an
employee
just
as,
in
the
bingler
case
in
the
tax
context,
this
court
had
no
trouble
saying
that
an
employee
who
was
on
full-time
leave
to
pursue
a
degree,
and
he's
drawing
pay
from
his
employer,
was
getting
that
pay
by
reason
of
his
service
as
an
employee.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
is
essentially
right,
subject
to--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--i
think
not
quite...
i
would
not
take
it
that
far,
justice
stevens.
in
arroyo
this
court
made
clear
that
there
is
a
point
at
which
a
payment
which
in
form
satisfies
one
of
the
exceptions,
satisfies
part
of
(c),
subsection
(c),
nonetheless
can
be
illegal,
if
it's
a
sham,
if
it's
really
an
attempt...
if
it's
really
an
attempt
not
to
further
a
legitimate
purpose
but
to
line
the
pockets
of
particular
union
representatives,
and
if
what
you're
positing
is
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
they
know--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--well,
i...
if
what
you're
positing
is
an
agreement...
a
negotiation
in
which
they...
in
which
what
is
said
is
that
jones
is
going
to
get
some
additional
money,
we
want
to
keep
jones
happy,
i
think
that
would
fall
outside
of...
that
would
fall
within
the
sham
exception.
it
would
fall
outside
section
(c)(1).
that
is
not--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--i
don't
think
that's
quite
accurate,
justice
stevens.
when
the
union
comes
to
the
bargaining
table
it's
not
bargaining
for
pay
for
any
particular
individuals.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
it
is
pay
for
particular
positions,
not
for
particular...
to
be
filled--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--union
positions
to
be
filled
not
necessarily
by
the
individuals
who
are
negotiating,
to
be
filled
by
people...
to
be
filled
by
union...
the
people
elected
by
the
employees.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
that
may
well
have
been
a
clearer
way
to
write
the
statute,
justice
scalia.
it
would
not
have,
however,
allowed
for
the
possibility...
congress
clearly
wanted...
the
difference
in
language
as
it
now
stands
is
that
a
situation
in
which
an
employer
makes
a
side
deal
with
one
of...
somebody
who
used
to
be
one
of
his
employees
having
nothing
to
do
with
the
fact
that
he
is...
is
or
was
an
employee...
he
says,
look,
you
come
to
the
negotiating
table
with
me.
here's
some
money.
that's
still
illegal
under
the
statute
as
drafted.
it
would
not
be
illegal
under
the
statute
you
posit,
so
that
the
structure
that's...
that
congress
did
seize
upon
does
allow
for
the
possibility
that
if
payments
are
made
that
are...
where
the
employment
status
is
an
irrelevancy,
it's
a
convenience,
but
it's
an
artifice,
those
could
be
condemned.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
i
don't
think
so
at
all,
justice
stevens.
i
think
in
part
the
employer
would
not
have
done
this
but
for
the
fact
these
are
employees.
what
this...
what
this
practice
is
about,
and
60
years
of
experience
tells
us,
this
practice
is
about
trying
to
create
a
system
of
workplace
representation
where
people
who
come
from
the
plant,
who
know
the
plant
and
know
the
players,
know
the
practices,
will
be
able
to
step
into
positions
of
workplace
representation.
it's
not
irrelevant
that
they
were...
that
they
served
as
employees
or
serve
as
employees.
it's
central
to
this...
what
this
system
was
about.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
saying
that
this
is
what...
how
this
system
evolved,
and
it
was
very
well-evolved
at
the
time
the
statute
was
written,
that
there
is
no
evidence
at
all
that
there
was...
that
anybody
in
congress
thought
the
system
as
it
has
evolved,
which
was
no
different
than
it
is
today,
was
corrupt,
was
illicit,
should
be
criminalized.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
insofar...
these,
quote,
full-time
people
are
not--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--right.
they
are
not
entitled
to
pay
for
certain
kinds...
they're
only
entitled
to
pay
from
the
company
for
performing
the
duties--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--and
i...
there's
not...
what
i
want
to
say
is
that
there
are
times
when
they
are...
they're
only
paid
for
certain
functions,
and
when
they
stop
doing
those
functions--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--i'm--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--i'm
not...
i
suppose,
as...
if
those
are
the
two
choices,
the
answer
is
they're
supplemented
from
the
company.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
sometimes,
then.
[laughter]
in
the
sense
that
there
are
certain
functions
for
which
they
are
not
paid
by
the
company.
they
are
paid
for
those
functions
by
the
union.
it's
not
the
case,
and
why
i
was...
i
didn't
mean
to
be
quibbling,
but
it's
not
the
case
that
for
the
functions
they
are
paid
for
the
company
but
the
union
provides
pay
on
top
of
that,
so--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--the
contract
says
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
pay
from
the
company
for
negotiations,
for
time
spent
in
any
meeting
outside
of
the
union
office,
and
for
any
other
activity
unrelated
to
the
duties
of
their
office.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
if
the--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--they
are...
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
justice
kennedy.
it...
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear,
but
i
believe
the
answer
to
that
is
no.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
if
we
are
talking
about
the
grievance
chairman,
these
employees
elected
to
this
full-time
position--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--for
the
3
years
that
he
serves
in
that
office--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--he
continues
to
accrue
credit
in
the
company's
pension
plan,
so
that
yes,
if
he
were
to
continue,
he
would
be...
he's
earning
pension
credits
for
those
years.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
first,
justice
breyer,
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
district
court
findings
that
bear
on
the
subject
at
all.
we
have
some
legal
conclusions,
and
this
is
essentially
a
legal
question
we're
discussing.
and
i...
our
answer
is
that
we
understand
the
phrase
compensation
for
or
by
reason
of
service
to
cover
any
payment
that
is
made
to
someone
who
is
or
has
been
an
employee
of
the
employer,
and
that
is
a
payment
that
is
provided
in
return
for
services
that
were
provided
to
the
employer.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
my
response,
justice
breyer,
is
no,
that
is
not
the
case,
that
these
are...
it
is
true
that
one
of
the
conditions
to
receive
these
payments
is
that
you
must
perform
these
services
as
a
union
representative,
just
as
in
an
educational
leave
situation
one
of
the
conditions
to
receive
that
money
is
that
you
must
be
going
to
school
full-time.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
it's
not
also
by
reason
of
the
fact
that
you
are
an
employee,
for
precisely,
i
believe,
the
reason
you
indicated
in
your
earlier
question,
that
this
is
only
paid
to
employees
and
is
paid
as
part
of
service
to
an
employee,
and
i
would
say
that
if
there
are
any
questions
about
the
language,
and
certainly
one
thing
that
i
think
has
to
be
clear
60
years...
40...
50
years
after
the
statute
was
enacted
it
can
hardly
be
said
that
this
language
plainly
and
unmistakably
condemns
a
practice
that
nobody
has
thought
was
illegal
for
50
years.
if
there's
any
doubt
about
what
the
language
means--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--there
was...
there
were...
the
trailways
court
held
that
a
particular
kind
of
agreement,
not
necessarily
this
agreement,
there
are
a
number
of
courts
the
other
way...
certainly
the
parties
to
collective
bargaining
have
been
negotiating
these
things
for
50
years
without
anybody
thinking
that
there
was
a
legal
problem.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
justice
rehnquist,
i'm
not
sure
that
that...
whether
that
principle
necessarily
applies
to
a
criminal
statute.
i
think
it's
particularly
inapt
here
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is,
as
i
was
saying
earlier,
we
have
some
exceptions
to
this
statute
that
are
crafted
in
a
way
to
indicate
that
congress
was
making
the
kinds
of
legislative
and
policy
judgments
that
congress
makes
in
treating
with
this...
with
the
subjects
of
welfare
funds
and
the
subject
of
dues
check
off
in
that
way.
these
are
much
more
categorical
exceptions
which
bespeak
an
effort
to
pull
the
entire
area
outside
of
the
ambit
of
this
criminal
statute
and
leave
it
for
treatment
under
other
law.
the
second
critical
point
here
is
that
we
have
very
clear
legislative
history.
these
provisions,
these
practices
were
called
to
congress'
intention.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
well,
justice
rehnquist,
let
me
try
to
impress
you
in
the
following
two
respects.
first,
that
we
know
that
this...
in
1947
those
who
were
making
these
changes
were
not
at
all
shy
about
saying
this
practice
that's
going
on
today
in
collective
bargaining
is
illegal,
it's
illegitimate,
we're
trying
to
change
it,
and
they
made
that
very
clear
about
a
number
of
types
of
collective
bargaining
agreements.
they
said
nothing
to
suggest
that
this
practice
was
something
they
were
trying
to
reach.
perhaps
even
more
important,
at
the
very
same
time
that
congress
did
that,
they
enacted
the
changes
to
section
10(c)
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
to
provide
essentially
a
rule
of
equality
whose
purpose,
the
legislative
history
tells
us,
was
precisely
to
allow
company
unions
the
same
privilege
that
unions
like
the
uaw
already
enjoyed
under
the
law
to
negotiate
for
lost
time
arrangements
of
this
sort.
mr.
david
m.
silberman
the
194--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--the
1941
ford-uaw
agreement
which
we
quote
in
our
brief
expressly
provides
for
full-time
people.
it
is
the
subject
of
a
colloquy
between
senator
ball
and
former...
gerald
reilly,
who
was
a
member
of
the
national
labor
relations
board,
in
1947.
the
chrysler
agreement
in
practice
provided
for
full-time
union
people.
it
was
the--
mr.
david
m.
silberman
--it's
the
strongest
example,
justice
stevens,
of
this
being
called
to
congress'
attention.
the
absence
of
any
congressional
response
and
the
10(c)
changes,
it
seems
to
me,
altogether
are
what
establish
the
legislative
intent
not
to
proscribe
these
kinds
of
practices.
