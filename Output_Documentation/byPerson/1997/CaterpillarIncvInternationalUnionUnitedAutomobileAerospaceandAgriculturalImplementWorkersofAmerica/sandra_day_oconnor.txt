well,
let
me
ask
you
this,
mr.
gangemi,
do
you
think
the
wage
payments
would
be
lawful
if
the
employees
actually
worked
for
the
employer
an
hour
a
day
and
the
rest
of
the
time
for
the
union?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
on
the
no-docking
arrangements,
you
think
a
fortiori
they
would
be
invalid,
where
there's
been
full
pay
but
only
part
work
for
the
employer.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
can
it
be
said
that
the
employer
derives
any
benefit
from
the
work
done
by
the
employee
for
the
union?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
asked
whether
the
employer
could
be
said
to
receive
any
benefit
from
the
work
done
by
the
employee
for
the
union.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
hasn't
done
so
in
terms
of
plain
language.
i
mean,
it
really
hasn't.
so
i
don't
know
how
the
argument
flows.
