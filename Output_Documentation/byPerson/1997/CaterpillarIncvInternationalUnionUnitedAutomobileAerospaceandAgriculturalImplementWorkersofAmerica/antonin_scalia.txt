that
isn't
all...
that
isn't
all
that
a
shop
steward
does,
unfortunately.
i
mean,
if
you're
appealing
to
plain
language,
that
would
allow
the
shop
steward
to
be
paid
only
for
the
time
that
he
spends
conferring
with
the
employer
and
not
with
consulting
the
employees
who
have
grievances,
and
so
forth.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
what
about
a
full-time
shop
steward?
he
spends
his
full
time--
justice
antonin
scalia
--conferring
with
other
employees
and
with
the
employer.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean,
to
the
extent
that
he's
acting
as
an
officer.
he
spends
his
full
time
on
union
work.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
the...
i
mean,
you
acknowledge
that
if
he's
conferring
with
the
employer
on
a
grievance,
that
isn't
spending
his
time
as
an
employee
of
the
employer.
that's
spending
his
time
as
a
union
member,
isn't
it,
and
you
concede
that
that
is
payable.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
all
i'm
asking
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
i'm
asking
you
is,
how
wide
is
the
harbor?
is
it
enough
that
the
steward
does
nonunion
work
for
an
hour,
a
half-hour,
15
minutes
a
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
depends
on
whether
he's
an
employee,
you
say--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
it
enough
to
make
him
an
employee
that
he
works
for
the
employer
15
minutes
a
day?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
what
is
the
line
you're
drawing,
because
i...
i
frankly...
i
think
it's
in
my
view
crucial
to
your
case
that
the
no-docking
rules
are
not
cast
aside,
and
the
government
has
really
portrayed
your
argument
as
an
attack
upon
that.
you
say
it's
not
an
attack
upon
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
want
to
know
how
much
of
the
nodocking
law
remains.
the
majority
of
the
employee's
time
has
to
be
for
the
employer
and
he
ceases
to
be
an
employee
if
he's
not
spending
most
of
his
time
for
the
employer
as
opposed
to
the
union?
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
engaging
in
two
types
of
activities.
some
of
it
is
for
the
employer,
and
some
of
it
is
as
a
shop
steward,
which
is
not
for
the
employer,
okay.
he's
doing
both.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
your
answer
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
all
his
time
is
spent
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
must
say
you're
not
being
helpful
to
me
on...
really
on
my
main...
on
my
main
concern.
you're
saying
it
depends
on
whether
he's
really
an
employee
of
the
employer
or
an
employee
of
the
union.
i
have
no
idea
how
to
answer
that
question.
justice
antonin
scalia
he's
spending
all
his
time
as
a
shop
steward
and
you
say
you
cannot
tell
me
whether
that
makes
him
an
employee
of
the
employer
or
of
the
union.
justice
antonin
scalia
good,
and
the
next
question
is
15
minutes.
he
works
15
minutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
is
an
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
will
the
no-docking
provision
apply
to
all
the
rest
of
his
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
concede
that
that's
okay.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
i
assume
a
particular
steward
might
spend
his
entire
time
doing
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
there's
no
exclusion
if
he
spent
his
whole
year
doing
that.
i
mean,
maybe
the
union
wants
to
economize
on
stewards,
so
it
only
has
one
steward
for
the
whole
plant.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
they
quote
it,
or
do
they
just
cite
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
guess
we
should
not
reject
virtue
even
if
it
comes
late.
is
that
your
argument
here?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
talking
about
this
industry.
you're
not
talking
about
economy-wide.
you're
talking
about
the
automotive
industry.
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
point
wouldn't
be
whether
they're
an
employee.
what
is
crucial
is
whether
these...
whether
the
company
is
paying
them
as
compensation
for
his
service
as
an
employee,
and
do
you
think
that
the
money
that
the
company
is
paying
while
he's
on
leave
is
compensation
for
his
service
as
an
employee?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh.
you
say,
you
think
it's
by
reason
of
his
service
as
an
employee?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
everybody
got
paid
leave
to
do
whatever
they
want,
then
i
would
agree
with
you,
but
this
is
a...
but
that
is
not
the
rule
here.
i
assume
everybody
in
this
company
can't
just
go
off
on
leave
and
continue
to
draw
his
pay.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
fellow
gets
his
pay
only
because
he's
working
for
the
union.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
you
say
that
he's
being
compensated
by
reason
of
his
service
as
an
employee.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
but
it
doesn't
really
matter
because
they're
not
getting
this
money
for
being
union
officials.
they're
getting
this
money
because
they
used
to
be
employees,
so
we
shouldn't
be
so
suspicious
about
it.
they're
not
really
getting
the
money
for
being
union
officials.
they're
getting
it
because
they
used
to
be
company
employees.
that's
why
they
want
the
raise.
i
don't
understand
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
the
statute
meant
what
you
want
it
to
mean,
it
would...
instead
of
having
that
exception
in
(c)(1)
it
would
be
easier
to
say
in
(a)(1)
to
any
representative
of
any
of
his
employees
who
are
employed
in
an
industry
affecting
commerce
except
such
representatives
as
are
former
employees
of
the
employer
himself.
that
would
have
done
the
trick.
we
wouldn't
have
all
this
argument.
it
would
be
a
lot
clearer.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
silberman,
what
about
retirement
pay?
when
these
senior
officers
retire
as
union
officials,
have
they
accumulated
company
retirement
pay
as
well
during
the
period
that
they're
serving
as
union
officials,
so
their
retirement
pay
also
comes
from
the
company
rather
than
from
the
union?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
the
statute
really
meant
that
you
can
get
around
the
prohibition--
--by
putting
in
an
agreement.
--against
paying
employees
of
the
union
by
simply
saying
i'm
really
paying
them
as
my
employees--
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
know
that
the
agreement
solves
anything.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
only
applies
to
grievance
chairmen?
it
wouldn't
apply
to
other
union
officials?
justice
antonin
scalia
--for
a
whole
different
section
of
the
shop,
i
mean,
a
section
of
the
shop
he
never
worked
in,
would
that
be
a
different
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we
agreed
with
you,
how
would
we
come
out
in
this
case?
did
the
contractual
provision
limit
it
just
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--just
to
grievance--
