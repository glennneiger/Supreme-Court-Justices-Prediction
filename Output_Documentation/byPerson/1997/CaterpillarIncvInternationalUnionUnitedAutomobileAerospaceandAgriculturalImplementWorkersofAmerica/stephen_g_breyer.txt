g.

--you
pay
him
when
he
goes
on
vacation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
pay
him
when
he
goes
on
vacation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
employees
are
paid
all
the
time
when
they
go
on
vacation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they're
hurt,
they
get
compensation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they're
permanently
crippled
they
get
compensation
and
their
health
benefits
continue,
and
all
kinds
of
things
continue.
what's
the
difference
between
that
and
this
same
person
who
works
for
both
taking
a
year
off
to
handle
grievances?
what
is
the
difference?
i'm
not
saying
there
isn't
one.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
to
put
all
the
cards
out,
so
to
speak,
i
mean,
you're
willing
to
let
them
do
that
when
it's
15
minutes
as
a
shop
steward
talking
to
the
immediate
supervisor.
you're
willing
to
let
that
happen
when
it's
a
plant
committeeman,
a
grievance
committeeman,
i
take
it,
talking
to
his
counterpart
the...
slightly
higher
up
in
the
employer's
hierarchy.
i
don't
know
if
you're
willing
to
do
it
when
he's
actually
even
higher
up
and
talks
to...
but
it
seems
like
sometimes
you're
willing
to
see
it
that
way,
sometimes
not.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
go
back
to
the
first.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
each
instance,
i'm
assuming
there
is
a
person
who
has
a
dual
capacity.
that
is,
he
works
for
the
employer,
but
he's
also
a
union
rep.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
so
the
statute
applies.
the
question
would
be,
is
the
payment
by
reason
of
his
employer
service?
is
it
by
reason
of,
those
are
the
key
words,
by
reason
of
and
if
it's
not,
of
course,
i
get--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
was...
i
just
want
to
go
back,
can
i,
to
my
question,
because
i
think
if
you
answer
it
directly
you
will
get
a
conceptual
distinction
that
will
help
you.
i'm
not...
but
i'm
thinking
of
an
employee,
and
the
employee
is
a
union
representative
as
well,
so
when
the
employer
writes
a
check
he
is
paying
money
to
a
representative
of
one
of
his
employees,
all
right,
so
he
fits
in
the
statute
and
it
also
happens
to
be
his
employee,
all
right?
he's
a
representative
of
the
union.
he's
also
his
employee.
now,
that
person
is
disabled
and
so
health
benefits,
vacation
benefits,
money
checks
flow
to
that
person
who
is
the
representative
of
the
employee
for
many
years
into
the
future.
that's
fine,
isn't
it?
that
is
not,
in
your
view,
money
paid
by
reason
of.
that
is
money
paid
by
reason
of.
all
right.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
now
tell
me
why
that
is
money
paid
by
reason
of,
why
the
docking
is...
no-docking
is
money
paid
by
reason
of,
but
the
payment
to
the
man
who
takes
the
year
off
to
be
the
grievance
committee
chairman
is
not
money
paid
by
reason
of.
if
you
could
explain
that
very
clearly,
i
think
i
would
understand
how
you're
trying
to
make
the
distinction.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
just
like
the
grievance
committee
chairman
is
here.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
that's
why
the
employ...
the
employer
would
never
pay
him
if
he
weren't
also
an
employee
of
the
employer.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
all
the
things
he's
done
in
the
past
to
earn
this
year
to
go
up
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--all
right.
now,
i'm
not...
i'm
not
taking
the
position.
i
want
to
see
what
your
response
is.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
you
say...
i
take
it
the
question
is
not...
the
word
is
payable,
not
compensation.
there
is
money...
is
the
question
is,
is
this
money
payable
by
reason
of
his
service
as
an
employee
to
the
employer,
all
right.
now,
you've
heard
the
petitioner
say,
just
look
at
the
record.
there
are
specific
findings,
which
he
began
to
list,
which
said
that
this
money
wasn't
payable
by
reason
of
his
former
service,
and
so
what
is
your
response
to
that,
that
why
is
this
money
payable
by
reason
of
his
service?
what,
in
other
words,
just
as
every...
we
were
asking
the
petitioner,
i
would
ask
you,
what
clearly,
or
what
line,
or
what
conceptual
line
distinguishes
those
payments,
in
your
view,
that
are
by
reason
of
his
former
service
from
those
that
are
not,
and
what
do
you
do
about
the
district
court,
having
found
that
these
were
not?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
now,
here
they
say
this
is
not
in
return
for
services
that
were
provided
to
the
employer.
this
is
in
return
for
services
that
are
being
provided
to
the
union,
and
what
is
your
response
to
that?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
it
certainly
has
to
be
in
the
agreement.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
there
anything
in
that
that...
just
on
that
particular
point
that
you're...
in
thinking
about
that,
i'm
thinking
of
grievances
itself
as
being
in
a
modern
unionized
context
the
very
heart
of
the
production
process.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
i...
but
i
don't
want
to
just...
i
knew
you
would
agree
with
that,
but
i--
[laughter]
but
i
mean,
i
want
to...
i'd
like
you
to
say
a
little
bit
more.
as
i
think
of
the
distinction,
but
is
there
anything
in
case
law,
or
anything
that
i,
you
know,
that
would
suggest
that,
or
support
it,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--we'd
have
to
say
that
the
grievance
process
is
part
of
the
production
process
in
a
way
that
the
negotiating
process
is
not
part
of
the
production
process,
or
a
line
to
be
drawn
in
that
way.
is
that
a
satisfactory
thing
from
your
point
of
view?
