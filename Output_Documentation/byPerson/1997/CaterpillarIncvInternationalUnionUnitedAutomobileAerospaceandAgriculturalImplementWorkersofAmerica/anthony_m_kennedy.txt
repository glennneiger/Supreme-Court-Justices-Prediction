what
are
those
functions
for
which
the
union
pays--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--all
right.
now--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--when
you
talk
about
office,
are
they
office...
are
they
officers
by
reason
of
the
union
charter?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
your
reference
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
inclusion
of
the
compensation
in
part
of
those
negotiations
cuts
against
you
as
much
as
for
you.
i
should
have
thought
that
the
very
purpose
of
this
statute
was
to
eliminate
this
from
the
collective
bargaining
context
so
that
the
union
could
not
make
demands
that
its
officials
be
compensated.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
seems
to
me
that
works
very
much
against
you.
the
whole
purpose
of
this
is
to
take
this
out
of
the
collective
bargaining
context.
