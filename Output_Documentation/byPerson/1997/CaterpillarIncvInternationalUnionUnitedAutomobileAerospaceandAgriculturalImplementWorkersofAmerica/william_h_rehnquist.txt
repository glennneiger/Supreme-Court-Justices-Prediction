--where
are
you
reading
from,
mr.
gangemi?
chief

william

whereabouts
on
page

chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you've
refer...
if
you'd
just
tell
us
where
in
the
reply--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
middle
of
page
4.
go
ahead,
rather
than...
well,
we'll
find
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
gangemi.
mr.
silberman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
the
significance
of
having
these
practices
1947
congress?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
but
what
that
boils
down
to
saying
is,
he
gets
it
simply
because
the
only
people
they
have
contracted
to
pay
it
to
are
those
who
have
the
status
of
employee
and
therefore
the
entire
issue
becomes
one
of
whether
the
employer
has,
in
fact,
recognized
this
as
something
it
would
like
or
is
willing
to
do
to
an
employee,
and
that's
the
substance
of
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
there's
nothing
left
of
the
prohibition.
no,
i
think
that's...
i
don't
think
that
is
fair.
there's
nothing...
the
prohibition,
the
broad
prohibition
is
a
prohibition
on
payments
of
money
to
union
officials.
it
was
an
antibribery
prohibition.
there
is
in...
we
do
think
that
302(c)(1)
is
a
very
broad
exception
and
we
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
be
contrasted
with
the
exceptions
stated
in
subsections
(c)(4)
and
(c)(5).
(c)(4)
deals
with
withholding
of
union
dues
and
congress
there
laid
down
a
very
specific
set
of
rules
and
subrules
as
to
when,
under
what
circumstances
those
kinds
of
payments
should
be
lawful
and
when
they
should
be
unlawful.
but
it
seems
to
me...
you
talk
about
a
broad
exception,
and
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
provided...
it
listed
all
the
people
who
have
ever
had
a
job
with
the
union,
the
president
of
the
union
on
down,
and
said
they
all
should
be
employed
in
the
company
from
january
1
to
january
3.
thereafter,
they
should
be
put
on
leave
and
remain
on
leave
as
long
as
they
want
to
stay
and
do
everything...
and
as
long
as
they
do
something
for
the
union
that
has
helped
in
the
collective
bargaining
negotiations
the
exception
would
apply.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
answer
the
question
and
then
explain.
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
on
the
other
side
of
that
argument
is
a
principle
that
exceptions
to
a
statutory
provision
are
to
be
construed
narrowly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'm
really
not
impressed
by
that
legislative
history.
here
congress
is
making
substantial
revisions
in
the
labor
laws,
and
i...
and
you
say
these
practices
were
called
to
its
attention.
so
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
silberman.
ms.
brinkmann,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
fact
that
it's
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
got
to
do
with
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brinkmann.
mr.
gangemi,
you
have
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gangemi.
the
case
is
submitted.
