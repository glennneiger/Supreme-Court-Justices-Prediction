the
benefit,
theoretical
though
it
may
be,
is
on
your
view,
i
take
it,
enough
to
qualify
as
a
payment
by
reason
of.
justice
david
h.
souter
yes,
but
to
the
extent
that
the
employee
is
being
paid
on
a
no-docking
scheme
the
same
argument
can
be
made
with
respect
to
the
period
covered
by
the
no-docking
rule,
can't
it?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
that
your...
i
understand
your
argument,
but
i
don't
see
why
your
argument,
if
we
accept
it,
does
not
force
us
to
say
that
the
no-docking
rule
is
prohibited.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
one
principle
i
think
has
been
suggested.
it
didn't
get
very
far
in
the
argument
here
but
at
least,
as
i
understand
it,
this
principle
was
suggested,
that
in
fact
the
language
in,
what
is
it,
(c)(1)
was
in
fact
added
in
an
effort
to
in
effect
equalize
the
position
of
those
who
are
working
for
an
affiliated
union
and
an
unaffiliated
union.
but
the
point
was
to
allow,
how
ill-defined
it
may
have
been,
some
no-docking
practice
for
all
of
them.
whatever
that
means,
and
however
facially
inconsistent
that
might
be
with
the
general
prohibition,
it
was
at
least
something
less
than
100
percent
of
one's
time
and
a
payment
of
100
percent
of
one's
salary
for
that
time
and
that,
at
least
on
the
basis
of
legislative
intent,
in
construing
an
ill-drafted
statute
we
should
recognize
the
basic
distinction
between
no
docking
for
some
work
and
full
payment
for
no
work
for
the
employer.
what
about
that
distinction?
justice
david
h.
souter
can
i
find
that
in
the
record?
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
but
what
about
that,
because
that
seems
an
awfully
good
question.
the...
suppose
this
was
the
same
circumstance,
what
the
employer
was
paying
for
was
an
employee
who
became
the
chief
negotiator
for
the
union,
okay,
to
write
all
the
collective
bargaining
agreements.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
what
about
that?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
when
you
say
close
inquiry,
i
mean,
that's...
then
you
see,
that's
what
i'm...
doesn't
that
make
you
a
bit
nervous
that
the
employer
is
paying
for
someone
who's
spending
his
full
time,
for
example,
being
the
union's
chief
negotiator
in
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
david
h.
souter
suppose
they
happen
to
pay
a
million
dollars
for
doing
it?
is
it
just...
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--well,
if,
in
fact,
you
were
to
prevail
here,
would
that
reasoning
that
allows
you
to
prevail
also
permit
the
employer
to
pay
for
a
full-time
employee
who
is
the
negotiator
for
the
union
in
respect
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
david
h.
souter
--you're
saying
that
the
nature
of
the
activity
here
is
one
you...
it's
the
nature
of
the
activity,
the
grievance,
the
nature
of
that
activity,
grievance,
working
out
of
grievances
that
makes
the
difference--
