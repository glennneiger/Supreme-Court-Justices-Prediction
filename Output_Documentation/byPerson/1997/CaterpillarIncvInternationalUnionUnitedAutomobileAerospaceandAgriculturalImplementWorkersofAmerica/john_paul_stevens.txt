justice
john
paul
stevens
you
can
draw
a
distinction
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
it
has
to...
are
your
people
employees
or
former
employees,
in
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
ones
who
work
full
time
at
the
union
get
no
pay...
do
no
services
whatsoever
for
the
company
for
5
years
in
a
row.
they're
employees
of
the
company.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
theory
is
there,
your
theory
is
they
are
current
employees
even
though
the
company
has
no
control
over
their--
justice
john
paul
stevens
not
to
line
their
pockets,
just
pay
them
enough
so
they'd
be
a
little
more
friendly
during
collective
bargaining
negotiations.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
seems
to
me
this
program
wants
to
make
a
lot
of
union
officials
happy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
this
demand
for
54
hours
wages,
isn't
that
pay
for
the
union
officials?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
can't
you
use
those
words
to
apply
to
this
very
situation?
isn't
the
former
employment
status
just
a
convenience
for
the
people
who
the
union
wants
to
run
the
union
affairs?
justice
john
paul
stevens
of
course,
they
can
do
the
best
negotiating,
too,
as
the...
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
i
really
don't.
it
seems
to
me
that's...
you're
just
describing
what
makes
a
good
union
negotiator,
or
a
good
union
arbitrator,
experience
in
the
plant
and
experience
in
the
company,
but...
and
you're
saying
that
the
company
shall
pay
for
all
of
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
fact
question
i
didn't
find
in
the
briefs?
are
these
full-time
union
people
paid...
is
their
entire
compensation
derived
from
the
company
or
is
part
of
it
supplemented
by
the
union?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
most
senior
people
in
the
union
that
we're
talking
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
my
question
is,
do
they
get
their
entire
income
from
the
company
or
is
their
company
pay
supplemented
by
the
union?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
help
me
if
you'd
answer
that
yes,
no,
or
sometimes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
three
choices,
yes,
no,
or
sometimes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
nobody.
the
court
of
appeals
though
it
was
illegal
till
they
changed
their
mind,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
just
one
factual
question
before
your
time
runs
out?
most
of
what
i
notice
in
your
brief
and
the
government
brief
seem
clearly
to
refer
to
no-docking
arrangements.
what
is
the
most
persuasive
and
clearest
example
you
can
point
me
to
in
that
legislative
materials
where
the
full-time
people
were
also
being
treated
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
full-time
for
the
union,
i
mean.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
colloquy
is
the
strongest
example
for
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
they're
current
payments
to
current
employees
for
services
being
performed
currently,
but
the
by-reason-of
language
would
naturally
be
read
to
preserve
the
pension
benefits
of
people
who
work
for
the
union
later
and
then
get
their
pension
benefits.
so
you're
right
about
the
language
with
respect
to
the
part-time
people,
but
i'm
not
so
sure
you're
right
about
it
with
regard
to
the
full-time
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
don't
really
see
why
negotiating
the
contract
is
unrelated,
either.
as
long
as
they...
he's
worked
for
the
company
for
3
or
4
days,
then
he
becomes
a
full-time
negotiator
and
he
gets
paid
regular
wages
by
the
company
and
maybe
they're
supplemented
a
little
by
the
union,
and
it's
all
out
in
the
open.
it's...
i
agree
with
you,
it's
got
to
be
all
out
in
the
open,
but
does
that
make
it
comply
with
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
understand
your
policy
reasons
for
saying
grievance...
it's
important
that
the
grievers
be
paid,
but
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
statute,
i
don't
see
the
distinction
between
the
grievance
person
and
the
negotiator.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
terms
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
much
easier
to
negotiate
with
somebody
who
knows
the
business,
familiar
with
the
history,
all
of
the
informal
rules
that
have
developed
over
the
years,
than
it
is
with
a
total
stranger
who
just
happens
to
be
a
lawyer
or
something
like
that.
