ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
first
address
the
relationship
between
section
302(c)(1)
and
section
8(a)(2).
the
payments
by
reason
of
service
as
an
employee
that
are
excepted
from
the
criminal
provision
of
302(a)
are
not
limited
to
the
section
8(a)(2)
proviso
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
when
the
board
has
upheld
no-docking
practices,
it's
not
because
the
board
has
held
that
it
fits
inside
that
proviso.
it's
because
the
board
has
held
that
it
doesn't
violate
the
general
prohibition
or
unfair
labor
practices
of
8(a)(2).
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
we
think
that
there
is
a
three-step
inquiry
here
that
demonstrates
that
they
are
by
reason
of.
first
of
all,
these
are
payments
that
were
bargained
for
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
that
defines
terms
of
payment.
second
of
all,
it
is
a
but-for
causation.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
it
talks
about
payments
for
services,
your
honor,
and
the
quintessential
location
where
one
looks
in
a
labor
environment
to
find
out
what
services
and
payment
are
due
is
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
second
thing
is
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--no,
we
don't,
your
honor,
and
that
is
a
necessary
predicate.
it's
certainly
an
indication
that
it's
by
reason
of.
it's--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
another...
well,
there
are
two.
another
thing
is
that
it's
a
but-for
cause.
union
officers
who
may
be
involved
in
the
grievance
process
who
are
not
employees
or
former
employees
are
not
paid
this.
the
third
step
is
the
close
nexus
between
the
grievance
chairman's
prior
service
as
an
employee
and
the
payments
he's
getting,
in
this
case
for
adjusting
grievances.
the
grievance
system
that's
structured
in
this
industrial
setting
is
a
four-step
process.
at
each
step
the
employee
with
the
complaint
is
represented
by
another
employee
from
that
production
unit,
the
steward
at
the
first
level,
then
a
committeeman,
and
then
the
grievance
chairman.
it
is
because
of
that
service
as
an
employee,
as
a
production
worker,
that
these
people
both
in
the
nodocking
situation
and
in
this
situation--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
would
be
a
very
different
inquiry
in
different
circumstances,
your
honor.
we
think
this
is
a
clear
case
not
only
because
of
this
close...
because
of
this
close
nexus
we
do
think
that.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
mm-hmm.
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
certainly
think
that
closer
inquiry
would
have
to
be
looked
at,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
there
is
the
section
8(a)(2)
proviso
that
prohibits
domination
interference.
this
is
a
criminal
prohibition,
and
when
we
look
to
enforce
this--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--those
are
several
things...
no.
those
are
several
things...
we
prosecute
sham
compensation,
corrupt
transaction--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it's
certainly
one...
we
would
be
looking
at
that.
one
thing
that
we
would
look
at,
for
example,
is
industry
acceptance
of
whether
or
not
that
is
something
that
an
employer
bargains
to
pay
for,
which
in
the
grievance
context
the
answer
is
yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
i'm--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
certainly--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--it
certainly
makes
it
clear
in
this
case.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
because
it's
not
a
sham.
because
it's
not
some
kind
of
corrupt
transaction.
the
questions
that
would
raise
suspicion,
for
example,
is
incommensurate
pay,
the
kind
of
situation
that
occurred
in
the
phillips
case
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
retroactive
negotiating,
secret
deals.
those
are
the
kinds
of
factors
that--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--look
at
as
criminal--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--i
think
that
in
this
case
it
would
not
be
so
unrelated.
you'd
have
to
again
look
at
industry
practice.
these
are
longstanding--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--well,
the
relationship
to
the
services
to
the
employee
is
not
as
clear,
your
honor.
the
grievance
adjustment
process
is
part
of
the
production--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
think--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--when
you're
interpreting
the
words
by
reason
of,
your
honor,
we
think
that
it
is
something
more
than
a
but-for
clause.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
the
fact
is,
your
honor,
experience
shows
that
there's
far
less
reason
to
believe
that
that
is
by
reason
of
their
service.
in
this
case,
there's
every
reason
to
believe
it.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
well,
your
honor,
certainly
not
only
is
it
because
of
production,
i
think
it's
also
because
it's
just
so
part
and
parcel
of
the
no-docking
provision
that
the
courts
have
all
upheld--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--we
certainly
think
that
in
a
criminal
prosecution
one
would
still
have
to
look
at
the
industry
accepted
practices
and
all,
but
i
think
that
certainly
is
an
indication
that
it
may
not
be
by
reason
of.
to
the
contrary,
another
example--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--yes.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
no,
to
activities
directly
related
to
its
office,
and
its
office
was
defined
in
conjunction
with
the
grievance
system.
and
this
is
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
your
honor,
to...
so
it's
looking
forward
to
declare
whether
or
not
these
are
per
se
invalid
and
petitioner's
not
entitled
to
that
judgment.
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor,
when
we
looked
at
the
case
on
caterpillar
petitioner
had
not
requested
a
remand
at
that
point,
and
we
don't...
we
believe
that
those
would
be
additional
factors
that
could
be
looked
into
to
see
if
there
was
some
kind
of
sham
compensation
or
corrupt
transaction.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
evidence
in
this
record
of
that,
but
it
could
be
appropriate
to
remand
it,
your
honor,
for
the
lower
courts
to--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--my
understanding
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
that
was
not
to
be
paid
for.
the
terms
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
omitted
paying
for
negotiation
of
vacation,
things
that
were
not
directly
related
to
its
office,
so
the
way
in
which
this
case
comes
to
the
court,
i
believe
it's
a
declaratory
judgment
action,
that
payments
under
that
collective
bargaining
agreement
are
per
se
a
violation
of
302(c).
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
your
honor--
ms.
beth
s.
brinkmann
--your
honor,
we
don't
believe
so.
again,
there
is
this...
302(c)
was
enacted
against
this
whole
backdrop
of
the
national
labor
relations
act
which
had
already
been
enacted
and
was
amended
at
the
same
time,
and
now
provides
for
unfair
labor
practices
civil
penalties,
not
criminal
sanctions.
302(a)
is
a
broad
criminal
prohibition
against
employers
paying
union
officials.
302(c)(1)
is
the
first
exception,
carving
out
an
exception
recognizing
that
employers
and
employees
have
a
different
relationship.
