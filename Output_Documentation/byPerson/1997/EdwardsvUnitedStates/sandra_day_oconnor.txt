mr.
shobat,
does
your
argument
depend
on
finding
that
both
the
type
and
the
quantity
of
drugs
are
elements
of
the
section
846
conspiracy?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
the
jury
perhaps
has
to
determine
is
that
it
was
a
controlled
substance,
but
not
a
specific
type
or
amount.
i
mean,
that's
possible
under
the
structure
of
the
statutes,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
means
that
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
statute,
and
then
perhaps
the
punishment
is
up
to
the
sentencing
authority,
the
judge.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
regardless,
wouldn't
evidence,
if
there
was
such,
showing
there
was
some
involvement
with
cocaine
base,
be
factored
in
as
relevant
conduct
under
the
guidelines?
i
don't
see
how
the
sentences
would
change
in
any
event.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
offense
was
a
conspiracy
to
possess
and/or
distribute
a
controlled
substance.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
if
it
did
make
a
difference,
that's
the
point.
the
government--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
if
it's
not
a
conspiracy
case
and
it
makes
a
huge
difference,
you
want
to
say
you're
not
going
to
say.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
were
all
these
sentences
within
the
range
of
the
powered
cocaine
range?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
government
says
it's
calculated
them
all
and
the
answer
is
yes.
