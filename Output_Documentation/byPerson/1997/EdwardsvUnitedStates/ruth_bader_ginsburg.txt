but
why
not
an
amount
as
well,
since
there's
such
a--
--right.
so
much
turns
on
amount.
why
does
it
turn
on
the
type
of
drug
more
or
less
than
the
amount
of
the
drug?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
saying
that
a
special
verdict
would
have
been
compatible
with
your
view
of
this
case?
that
is,
the
judge
says,

under
your
theory

the
government
to
charge
two
separate
conspiracies,
one
for
powdered
cocaine,
the
other
for
crack,
and
then
for
the
punishments
to
be
consecutive?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
may
i
ask
first
if
you
agree
with
judge
easterbrook
that
it
would
be
sufficient
if
the
indictment
simply
alleged
controlled
substance,
without
any
identification?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
the
defendant
has

know
enough

the
case
