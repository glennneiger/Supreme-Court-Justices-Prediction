g.

you're
saying,
type
of
drug
is
an
element
of
the
offense,
but
amount
of
drug
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
are
you...
well,
what
is
the
argument?
is
the
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--well,
i--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--you
believe
that
amount
is
as
well?
so
in
other
words,
we
have
a
big
list
in
841(b)
of
penalties,
and
the
penalties
vary,
sometimes
dramatically,
depending
upon
the
amount
of
the
drug
and
depending
upon
what
kind
of
drug
and,
as
you
said
recidivism,
which
is
treated
specially.
all
right.
now,
your
point
is
that
jury
has
to
find
type
and
probably
amount.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
difficulty
with
doing
that
is,
why
does
it
have
to
find
it,
because
congress
intended
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
would
congress
have
intended
the
following:
a
person
is
accused,
for
example,
of
possessing
with
intent
to
distribute
more
than
one...
more
than...
between
5
and
10
kilograms
of
heroin,
let's
say,
and
the
person's
defense
is,
i
wasn't
there.
i
was
in
chicago.
is
he
supposed
to
make
the
alternative
defense,
oh,
by
the
way,
if
i
was
there,
it
was
only
1/2
a
kilo?
i
mean,
why
would
we
ask
a
jury
to
decide
that
kind
of
thing?
why
would
we
want
to
put
a
defendant
in
that
kind
of
position?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
that's
why
i
would
think
that
841(b)
includes
punishment
factors,
and
if
it
is
supposed
to
be
punishment
factors
there's
no
problem
for
the
defendant,
and
if
it's
supposed
to
be
punishment
factors
in
respect
to
amounts,
i
don't
see
how
you
could
distinguish
why
it
shouldn't
be
punishment
factors
in
respect
to
type.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no.
that's
true
of
every
instance
of
guideline
sentencing,
and
it's
true
of
every
instance
in
which
congress
has
passed
a
statute
that
increases
maximum
penalties
for
what
is
called
a
sentencing
factor.
am
i
right
that
you
must
be
complaining
about
one
or
about
the
other?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
then
i'm
not
sure
what
your
argument--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that's
true
of
every
instance
in
which
congress
increases
a
penalty
for
what
they
call
a
sentencing
factor.
am
i
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
sometimes
congress
passes
a
statute...
drugs,
immigration...
you
know,
where
they
say,
if
you've
done
x
in
committing
the
crime,
the
maximum
goes
from
2
years
to
20
years,
or
from...
so
you're
complaining
about
all
those,
is
that
right,
or
is
there
something
special
here?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that
changes...
in
another
case
we've
been
involved
in
this,
but
the...
if
that
changes,
because
it's
not
just
guideline
but
also
statutory
addons...
let's
call
them
sentencing
factors.
if
you
think
that
changes
the
fact
that
it's
a
statutory
sentencing
factor
that
increases
a
penalty,
if
you
think
that
makes
a
difference
in
your
favor
here,
what
do
you
do
with
the
earlier
supreme
court
cases,
mcmillian
and
so
forth,
that
we've
been
looking
into,
which
say
that
where
you
have
a
sentencing
factor
such
as
possession
of
a
gun,
which
increases
the
maximum
penalty,
that
can
be
a
determination
to
be
made
by
a
judge.
it
needn't
be
charged
in
the
indictment,
and
it
needn't...
in
fact,
in
mcmillian
i
think
we
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
so
how
do
you
deal
with
those
cases
and
also
win
your
case?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
because?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
why
isn't
that
worse?
why
aren't
mandatory
minimum
penalties
from
a
defendant's
point
of
view
actually
a
lot
worse
than
an
increase
in
the
maximum?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
the
commission
could
deal
with
that
as
it
wishes,
couldn't
it?
i
mean,
if
the
commission
said,
look,
what
we
think
you
have
to
do
is
sentence
the
person
to
10
years
if
he
has
5
grams
of
crack,
and
you
have
to
sentence
him
to
2
years
if
it's
5
grams
of
cocaine,
and
you,
the
sentencing
judge,
are
to
take
as
a...
an
assumption
of
what
the
amounts
are
that
which
is
found
by
the
jury
and
if
there
is
no
jury
finding
you
will
assume,
blah,
blah,
blah.
they
could
write
a
guideline
like
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
if
they
don't
like
the
way
the
judges
are
doing
it,
they
can
write
the
opposite
guideline.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
if
the
courts
that
find
the
way
you
think
is
wrong
are
finding
that
way
because
they
think
the
guidelines
require
them
to
do
so,
then
the
answer
would
be
that
the
commission
could
make
clear
that
that
isn't--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
the
guidelines
require.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
there's
nothing
for
us
to
decide--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
are
several...
i
mean,
are
you
talking...
which
question?
i
mean,
there's
a
question
reserved
in
watts,
i
take
it.
the
question
reserved
in
watts
is
whether
a
sentencing
factor
can
be
decided
by
a
judge
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
or
whether
the
judge
might
decide
it
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
that's
one
question
which
we
haven't
decided,
i
guess.
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
a
separate
question
is
who
has
to
decide.
another
question
might
be
whether
you
had
to
get
notice
in
an
indictment,
and
whether
it's
called
an
element
or
something.
i
mean,
there
are
a
bunch
of
questions
there.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
do
we
have
to
decide
here?
