justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
with
just
one
question
to
be
sure...
what
if,
in
this
case,
instead
of
a
general
verdict
you
have
a
special
verdict
and
the
jury...
a
whole
stream
of
different
alternatives,
and
the
jury
found
not
guilty
as
to
9
out
of
the
10,
but
on
one
they
said
he
was
guilty
of
conspiring
to
distribute
5
grams
of
powder,
and
that's
all.
under
your
view,
could
the
judge
nevertheless
sentence...
the
judge
has
a
different
view
of
the
evidence.
he
thinks
he
really
committed
100
kilograms
of
crack.
that's
the
judge's
view.
the
judge
could
nevertheless
sentence
on
the
basis
of
his
view
of
the
evidence
even
in
the
conspiracy
context.
justice
john
paul
stevens
with
specific
findings.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
the
government's
view,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
refresh
my
recollection
on--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--on
one
minor
point.
had
we
decided
that
the
judge
in
the
sentencing
proceeding
can
rely
on
illegally
seized
evidence
in
making
this
determination?
you
just
suggested
he
might
know
about
it
through
a
suppression
motion,
for
example.
have
we
said
that's
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
position
is,
it's
permissible?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
that's
your
example
you
happened
to
pick
to
explain
what
the
judge
could
see
that
the
jury
might
not
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
he
can...
he
only
has
to
do
it
by
a
preponderance.
he
can
do
it
even
if
the
jury
finds
him
not
guilty,
and
even
if
he
relies
on
illegally
seized
evidence.
it's
a
pretty
extreme
position.
well,
we
decided
the
issue
if
it's
a
not
guilty
finding,
haven't
we?
