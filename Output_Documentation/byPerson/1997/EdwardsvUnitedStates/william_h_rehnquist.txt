chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
this
afternoon
in
number
96-8732,
vincent
edwards,
et
al.,
v.
united
states.
mr.
shobat.
am
i
pronouncing
your
name
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
finding
you're
not
talking
about
a
special
verdict,
you're
just
talking
about
a
finding
in
its
deliberative
process
that
results
in
a
verdict
of
guilty.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
ordinarily
a
finding
in
terms
of
the
statute
is
perfectly
sufficient,
isn't
it?
here
841
says,
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
knowingly
or
intentionally
to
manufacture,
dispute
or...
distribute
or
possess
a
controlled
substance.
so
isn't
it...
one
would
think
that
a
verdict
that
says,
guilty
of
841,
or
guilty
of
possessing
or
conspiring
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance,
would
be
sufficient
for
the
guilt
element.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
think
it
would
have
been
okay
if
the
government
just
charged
a
controlled
substance
generally
and
left
itself
free
to
prove
any
number
of
other
things?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
request
an
instruction
that
the
jury
be
required
to
specify
amounts
or
choose
as
between
cocaine
and
cocaine
base?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
didn't
object
to
that
instruction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
agree,
don't
you,
mr.
shobat,
that
if
there
had
not
been
this
ambiguity
in
the
jury
verdict,
nonetheless
a
sentencing
judge
could
have
taken
into
consideration
a
wide
number
of
things
in
deciding
what
to
sentence
your
clients
to,
a
prior
offense,
prior
indictment,
prior
conduct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
mr.
shobat.
mr.
dumont,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
watts.
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
object
of
the
conspiracy
was
either
to
distribute
or
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
they
still
have
bills
of
particulars?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
dumont.
mr.
shobat,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
shobat.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
