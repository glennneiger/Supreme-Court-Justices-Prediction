justice
antonin
scalia
well,
surely
there's
an
attempt
to
buy
a
particular...
i
mean,
are
these
drug
dealers
that
stupid
that
they
don't
contract
to
buy
a
particular
substance?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
would
be
the
conspiracy
then,
wouldn't
it,
in
substance?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
the
difference
in
the
maximum
sentence
that
could
be
imposed
under
the
one
or
under
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
you're
saying
is,
if
it
was
powder
cocaine
it
was...
the
maximum
was
20,
and
if
it
was
crack,
the
maximum
was
100?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
can't.
they
haven't
gone
far
enough
in
the
negotiations.
i
assume
then
he
would
have
to
use
whatever
the
minimum
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
most
he
can
say
is
that
there
was
some
transaction,
but
i
can't
say
that
there's
enough
to
kick
it
over
into
any
punishment
higher
than
the
minimum.
isn't
that
your
position?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
don't
know,
the
minimum
is
what
governs.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
thing.
if
you
don't
know,
you
assume
it's
the
one
that's
punished
the
least
severely.
is
your
argument...
it
can't
be
about...
the
indictment
says
these
particular
people
conspired
to
distribute,
to
possess
with
intent
to
distribute
cocaine,
and
they
also
conspired
with
intent...
possessed
with
intent
to
distribute
cocaine
base...
crack.
there's
26
very
specific
paragraphs,
and
it
says
that
violated
846
and
841.
so
the
person,
to
get
the
penalty,
would
look
up
846
and
look
up
841,
and
he'll
see
the
big
list,
and
there's
a
big
list
of
maximums.
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
not
complaining
about
the
jury's
finding
your
clients
guilty.
you're
saying
you're
willing
to
accept
that
verdict,
but
you're
saying
the
way
it
went
to
the
jury,
all
you
can
punish
them
for
is
the
least
of
what
was
charged.
justice
antonin
scalia
under
the
guidelines,
or
under
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
the
guidelines
control
what
statutory
maximum
is
available?
i
don't
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
statutory
maximum
and
minimum
cannot
be
clear
if
you
don't
know
what
the
substance
is,
can
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
wouldn't
be
similarly
inconsequential
as
far
as
the
guidelines
are
concerned,
they're
only
inconsequential
as
to
the
statutory
grades?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
would
the
guidelines
treat
differently
two
substances
that
are
treated
the
same
in
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
it
can't
define
the
offense
if,
indeed,
as
you
just
read,
you
are
to
be
punished
with
the
same
penalties
as
those
prescribed
for
the
offense.
there
are
no
penalties
prescribed
for
841(a).
when
you
read
841(a)
you
have
no
idea
what
the
penalties
are,
so
that
cannot
be
the
offense--
justice
antonin
scalia
--referred
to
in
846.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
and
if
all
i
had
before
me
was
841,
i
would
agree.
but
you
have
before
you
846,
which
you
just
read,
which
says
any
person
who
attempts
or
conspires
to
commit
any
offense
defined
in
this
chapter
shall
be
subject
to
the
same
penalties
as
those
prescribed
for
the
offense.
there
are
no
penalties
prescribed
for
the
offense
of
violating
841(a).
justice
antonin
scalia
i
can
read
you
841(a)
and
you
can't
tell
me
what
penalty
is
prescribed
for
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
go
down
to
(b)
to
figure
it
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
fine.
i'm
willing
to
accept
(b).
then
(b)
becomes
part
of
the
offense.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
fine.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
apply
the
minimum.
i
think
that's
an
easy
answer,
isn't
it?
it's
up
to
the
government
to
prove
whatever
is
necessary
to
prove
in
order
to
impose
a
penalty
and
if
you
can't
figure
out
what
it
was,
the
most
you
can
impose
is
the
minimum,
i
would
assume.
what's
hard
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me
it's
the
only
answer.
the
burden's
on
the
government
to
establish
what
needs
to
be
established
to
impose
the
penalty,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
your
position
that
as
with
the
guidelines
those
sentencing
factors
only
require
judgment
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
the
judge,
so
the
judge
makes
the
decision
that
it's
more
likely
than
not,
by
a
hair,
that
this
was
crack
rather
than
powdered,
and
therefore
you
get
40
more
years,
or
20
more
years,
by
a
preponderance.
gee,
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i'm
talking
about
the
maximum,
that
the
statutory
maximum
i
could
have
given
you
if
it
was
one,
you
know,
if
it
was
powdered,
is,
say,
20,
and
the
statutory
maximum
i
can
give
you
if
it
was
crack
is
40,
or
60.
there's
a
big
difference
depending
on
the
quantity,
i
guess.
and
all
the
judge
has
to
say
is,
well,
it's
a
close
question,
but
by
a
hair
i
think
it's
more
likely
that
it
was
crack
than
powder
and
therefore
i'm
going
to
give
you
60
years
instead
of
20.
that
doesn't
seem
to
you,
something
wrong
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
dumont,
would
you
explain
again,
because
i
don't
understand
it,
how
it's
possible
that
you
can
come
out
with
one
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
where
it's
a
conspiracy
charge
but
a
different
response
where
you're
being
prosecuted
for
simple
distribution?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me,
if
your
answer
is
in
simple
distribution
we're
not
going
to
let
the
judge
do
it,
i
don't
see
why
it...
why
you
can
let
the
judge
do
it
in
the
conspiracy
thing,
since
the
conspiracy
statute
refers
to
the
distribution
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
guess
what
i'm
saying,
i
don't
see
how
that's
rational.
i
mean,
if
it
refers
to
the
offense
in
841,
and
if
you're
treating
841
as
consisting
not
of
one
offense
in
(a)
but
of
each
one
being
a
separate
offense
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy
and
everything
else,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
treat
it
any
differently
for
purposes
of
846,
which
refers
to
the
offense
in
841.
but
i
understand
your
position.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's...
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
just
before
you
go
on,
that's
quite
correct
unless
you
accept
your
colleague's
view
of
what
846
requires.
i
mean,
if
you
acknowledge
that
846
does
require
you
to
charge
something
other
than
an
intent
to
distribute
some
controlled
substance,
and
if
you
acknowledged
his
view
that
it
requires
you
to
specify
a
controlled
substance,
then
it
would
be
a
dual
object,
under
his
view
of
the
world.
