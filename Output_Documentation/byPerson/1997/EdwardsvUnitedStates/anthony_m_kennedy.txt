well,
of
course,
i
guess
conspiracy
is
a
completed
offense
even
before
the
drugs
are
actually
purchased.
suppose
the
conspiracy
is...
the
conspirators
are
apprehended
before
they
effected
the
buy.
how
does
the
judge
determine
the
sentence
in
that
case?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
my
hypothetical
is,
they're
not
sure.
they
want
to
just
acquire
some...
how
much
do
you
have
+/?
and
then
they're
apprehended.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
if
you
commit
the
offense
of
conspiracy
you
perhaps
under
one
view
would
simply
be
subject
to
the
risk
of
being
sentenced
based
on
what
the
conspiracy
turned
up
and
the
judge
says,
it's
5
grams,
or
10
grams,
or
whatever.
