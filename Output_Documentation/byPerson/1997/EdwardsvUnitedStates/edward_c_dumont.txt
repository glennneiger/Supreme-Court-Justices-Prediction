mr.
edward
c.
dumont
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
there
is
one
issue
that's
rather
straightforward
that
is
genuinely
presented
on
the
facts
of
this
case
and,
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
address
that
just
for
a
moment
first.
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
when
a
drug
conspiracy
verdict
does
not
reveal
exactly
what
drug
the
jury
may
have
concluded
was
involved,
or
more
than
one
drug,
that
under
the
guidelines
the
court
is
limited
to
sentencing
only
on
the
basis
of
the
drug
that
will
produce
the
lower
penalty.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
under
the
guidelines.
there
are
at
least
three--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--in
our
view
they
don't
control
that
at
all,
but
three
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have
held
that
even
if
you're
talking
about
a
case
where
the
statutory
maximum
and
minimum
are
clear,
that
in
terms
of
applying
the
guidelines
the
district
court
at
sentencing
must
apply...
must
take
into
account
only
the
drug
that
will
produce
the
lower
guidelines
sentence.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i'm
not
sure
that's
true
now,
because
you
could
have
a
couple
of
possibilities,
both
of
which
would
put
you
into,
say,
the
minimum
category,
the
zero
to
20
category,
but
one
of
which
would
put
you
at
19
years
under
the
guidelines,
and
one
of
which
would
put
you
at
5
years,
so
it
can
make
quite
a
difference.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
my
only
point
is--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--the
guidelines
are
much
more
specific
about
what...
how
you
do
the
quantity
calculations
and
how
you
take
things
into
account,
but
my
point
is
only
that
even
in
cases
where
there
is
no
controversy
about
what
the
statutory
range
is,
the
guidelines
range
can
differ
quite
a
bit,
depending
on
whether
you
take
into
account
some
crack
or
don't
take
into
account
some
crack.
and
some
of
the
courts
of
appeals
have,
in
fact,
held
that
in
a
case
like
this,
if
you
accepted
the
verdict
was
ambiguous,
the
judge
would
be
limited
to
taking
into
account
only
the
powdered
cocaine
that
was
involved.
now,
we
think
that
those
cases
are...
that
issue
is
presented
here
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
it
would
make
a
big
difference
to
these
petitioners
whether
they
are
sentenced
for
powder
or
for
crack,
but
we
think
that
those
cases
that
would
limit
the
court
to
powder
under
the
guidelines
are
flatly
inconsistent
with
this
court's
sentencing
jurisprudence,
most
recently,
obviously,
the
decision
last
term
in
watts
and
the
court's
decision
in
witte.
we
know
from
watts
that
even
if
they
had
been
charged,
as
petitioners
say
they
could
have
been,
with
two
separate
conspiracies
and
the
jury
had
acquitted
on
the
crack
conduct,
that
the
crack
cocaine
could
have
been
taken
into
account
at
sentencing
by
the
judge,
and
it
cannot
be
true
that
that
is
permissible
but
then
it's
not
permissible
to
do
so
here,
where--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
there
may
be
some
question
about
whether
the
commission
would
have
power
to
do
anything
that
would
seem
to
trench
on
what
this
court
said
in
watts
and
required
by--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--oh--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--yes,
absolutely.
that's
true.
if--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--if
the
courts
feel
they
are
being
bound
by
the
guidelines.
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
acquiescence
in
this
case,
there
is
no
indication...
the
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
held
that
the
district
judge
is
limited
in
sentencing
to
the
lesser
drug
not
only
don't
address
that
issue,
they
don't
even
mention
the
guidelines.
i
mean,
it's
one
of
our
quarrels
with
them.
they
seem
to
be
innocent
of
the
developments
in
the
sentencing
law
under
the
guidelines.
so
we
would
submit
that
those
cases
are
flatly
wrong,
and
that's
what
this
case
is
really
about.
it's
what's
presented
on
the
facts
here,
and
the
decision
on
that
issue
ought
to
be
clear.
now,
it
is
true,
as
petitioners
argue,
that
statutory
maxima
and
minima
trump
whatever
is
in
the
guidelines,
and
it
is
therefore
relevant
to
ask
what
the
verdict
ambiguity
does
or
should
or
might
have
to
do
with
setting
the
statutory
minimum
and
maximum.
now,
the
short
answer,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
in
this
case
is
no
effect,
because
if
you
calculate...
and
we
did
do
the
math,
and
it's
been...
petitioners
have
not
demonstrated
that
there's
anything
wrong
with
our
math...
that
if
you
calculate
the
statutory
ranges
in
this
case
based
purely
on
the
district
judge's
powder
cocaine
findings,
you
will
find
that
the
sentences
actually
imposed
in
every
case
fall
within
permissible
statutory
range,
so
our
submission
would
be
there's
no
issue
on
the
facts
of
this
case
under
the
statute.
but
should
the
court
wish
to
proceed
and
consider
that
issue,
we
think
it's
plain
from
the
structure
and
language
of
the
relevant
statutes
here,
sections
846
and
841,
that
the
answer
to
that
is
that
these
are
sentencing
factors
for
the
trial
judge.
now,
section
846,
which
is
on
pages
1
and
2
of
the
appendix
in
the
blue
brief,
says
any
person
who
attempts
or
conspires
to
commit
any
offense
defined
in
this
sub
chapter
shall
be
subject
to
the
same
penalties,
and
so
on.
the
offenses
are
defined
by
the
other
sections
in
that
portion
of
the
united
states
code.
if
you
then
look
at
841,
which
is
the
object
defense
here,
841(a)
defines
the
offense,
and
the
offense
is
either
possession
or...
with
the
intent
to
distribute,
or
distribution--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
with
respect,
we
would
obviously
disagree
with
that.
what
you
know
from
846
is
that
you're
looking
for
an
object
offense.
the
object
offense
is
defined
in
841(a),
which
says,
unlawful
acts,
except
as
authorized
and
so
on
you
may
not
distribute,
or
possess--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--with
intent
to
distribute
controlled
substances.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
with
respect--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--with
respect,
i
can,
because
what
i'll
say
is,
you
look
down
to
(b),
which
prescribes
the
penalties
for
the
offense
defined
in
(a).
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
disagree
about
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
disagree
about
that,
obviously,
and
our
analysis
is
that
841(a)
defines
an
offense
which
is
complete
once
the
jury
finds
that
you
have
distributed
or
manufactured
or
possessed
with
the
intent
a
controlled
substance,
and
it's
true
they...
in
a
substantive
count,
then
in
the
nature
of
things
they
will
have
to
find
a
controlled
substance
involved.
i
would
point
out,
as
came
out
from
some
of
the
questions,
in
a
conspiracy
offense
that's
not
at
all
clear.
there
are
certainly
conspiracies
for
which
you
could
be
charged
and
which
you
could
be
found
guilty
where
you
would
have
no
idea
what
the
type
of
substance
involved
was.
now,
i
grant
you,
that
will
give
rise,
in
those
cases,
if
they
actually
happen,
to
strange
sentencing
issues
under
both
841(b)
and
under
the
guidelines,
because
it's
not
clear
what
you
do
with
something
where
you
really
don't
know
even
what
type
of
drug
was
involved,
but
the
fact
is
the
conviction
would--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
a
potential
answer
to
that
question.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
for
present
purposes
my
point
would
be,
we
would
establish
that
at
sentencing
to
the
judge,
and
the
conviction
would
be
valid.
even
if
it
were
true
that
we
could
not
impose
a
term
of
imprisonment,
the
conviction,
the
special
assessment
and
the
record
and
so
on
would
reflect
a
conviction
for
a
felony,
and
that
felony
would
be
defined
by
841(a).
it
would
have
nothing
to
do
with
841(b).
841(b)
has
to
do
with
prescribing
the
penalties
that
are
appropriate
under
particular
circumstances
for
violations
of
841(a).
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
absolutely
right,
and
our
point
here
is,
when
you
move
into
the
realm
of
conspiracy...
now,
846
obviously
covers
a
wide
range
of
different
target
statutes
and
so
on,
and
in
this
particular
case
we're
dealing
with
846,
referring
to
841
as
the
object
statute.
we
think
it's
fairly
clear
that
what
congress
would
have
intended
here
is
when
you
are
convicted
of
conspiracy
to
violate
841
what
happens
is
the
judge
at
sentencing
looks
at
the
complex
of
offense
conduct
involved
in
that
conspiracy
under
very
traditional
pinkerton
type
conspiracy
vicarious--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
would
say
particularly
in
the
conspiracy
context...
in
the
conspiracy
context,
the
answer
is
clearly
yes,
because
as
long
as
the
conviction
is
valid,
everything
else
is
a
sentencing
factor
and,
as
the
court
pointed
out
in
watts,
the
difference
in
standard
of
proof
makes
a
huge
difference
there,
because
all
the
jury
has
said
by
declining
to
convict
on
the
other
counts
is
they
weren't
convinced
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
but
there's
a
big
range
there
between
that
and
preponderance
of
the
evidence
where
the
court
can
operate.
now,
what
i
will
say
is,
it's
a
harder
case
if
you
have
a
substantive...
a
set
of
substantive
distribution
counts
and
the
jury
acquits
on
several
but
convicts
on
only
one,
because
in
that
case
there's
a...
i
think
a
substantial
statutory
interpretation
question
that
arises
about
what
841(b)
means
when
it
says,
in
the
case
of
a
violation
of
subsection
(a),
involving.
now,
the
circuits
are
split
on
that
issue
and
it's
certainly
not
presented
here,
but
it
would
not
be
unreasonable
for
a
court
to
hold,
and
several
courts
of
appeals
have
taken
this
route,
that
in
a
substantive
distribution
case
you
are
limited
in
terms
of
your
statutory
maximum
by
the
offense
conduct
that
would
be
dealt
with
in
that
one
substantive
distribution
count.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
we
haven't
taken
a
position
in
this
court
on
that
question,
and
i
hesitate
to
concede
it
in
this
case
because
it's
not
presented,
but
it
would
certainly
be
a
plausible...
a
plausible
statutory
outcome.
the
tenth
circuit
has
gone
the
other
way
on
that
question
and
has
said
that
no,
all
of
these
things
are
sentencing
factors
to
be
dealt
with
by
the
judge,
even
under
the
statute.
i
think...
so
we
think
that...
just
to
refer
back
to
that
language
that
i
was
just
quoting,
again,
if
we're
talking
about
what
is
an
element
here
and
what
is
a
sentencing
factor,
we
think
that
the
language
of
841
is
pretty
clear
on
that.
it's
about
as
clear
as
you
get.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
that's
right.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
subject
to
statutory
minimum
and
maximum
that
might
supervene,
and--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--well,
if
we're
talking
about
the
simple
distribution
offense,
and
we're...
if
the
question
is,
under
841(b),
are
all
of
those
always
just
at
the
decision
of
the
judge,
i
think
that
is
a
difficult
question,
and
we
will
certainly
address
it
in
the
cases
it
arises
in--
it
doesn't
arise
in
this
case,
partly
because
this
is
a
conspiracy
case.
in
a
conspiracy
case
we
think
what
happens
is
what
happened
here,
which
is
the
judge
goes
through
all
the
evidence
very
carefully...
i
commend
to
you
the
very,
very
detailed
sentencing
findings
that
the
judge
made
in
this
case,
and
he
goes
through
all
the
evidence,
sifts
it
and
decides
in
this
case,
not
very
favorably
to
the
government,
i
would
add,
what
the
quantities
of
drugs
are,
what
types
of
drugs
are
involved,
and
what
quantities
can
be
properly
attributed
to
any
given
defendant.
and
in
this
case
it
makes
no
difference
under
the
statute
because
whatever...
all
of
his
findings
that
he
made
for
purposes
of
the
guidelines
put
these
defendants
in
the
right
statutory
minimum
and
maximum
range,
or
the
same
range,
depending
on
how
you
calculate
it.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
it
did
make
a
difference.
i
think
in
a
conspiracy
case
the
result
would
be
the
same,
because
even
the
courts
that
have
held...
even
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
held
that
you
need
to
be
limited
by
the
offense
of
conviction
have
said
well,
of
course,
in
a
conspiracy
case,
when
you're
talking
about
defining
what
was
involved
in
the
offense
of
conviction
for
841(b)
purposes
you
pick
up
pinkerton
principles,
and
principles
of
vicarious
liability.
so
that
ends
up
being
either
indistinguishable
from
or
very,
very
close
to
the
relevant
conduct
inquiry
under
the
guidelines,
so
in
a
conspiracy
case
we
really
think
there
is
no
substantial
issue
about
that,
that
your
statutory
maximum
and
minimum
are
going
to
set
by
the
same
process
as
your
guidelines
sentence,
and
there's
really
nothing
wrong
with
that.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
our
position
for
purposes
of
argument
in
this
case
is
that
the
judge
has
the
authority
to
decide
that,
but
i
acknowledge
that
it's
a
very
difficult--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
correct.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
there
are--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--there
are
any
number
of
questions
that
you
don't
have
to
decide
here,
and
we
would
urge
the
court
to
stick
generally
to
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
i
think
that's
useful
and
i
think
the
facts
of
this
case
are
typical.
but
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
i
understood
that
to
be
about
the
limited
question
of,
in
a
simple
distribution
case
where
there
is
a
certain
amount
of...
there's
one
distribution,
for
instance,
at
issue,
and
the
question
is
then
does
the
judge
get
to
decide
what
is
involved
in
that
distribution.
and
i
would
submit
the
following
intermediate
position,
which
is,
there
may
be
circumstances
where
all
that
is
proved
to
the
jury
might
be
a
small
amount
of
one
drug,
for
instance,
but
that
on
particular
facts
the
judge
might
be
able
to
conclude
that
because
of
a
suppression
motion
or
for
some
other
reason
the
jury
didn't
see
all
of
the
conduct
that
was
involved
in
that
particular
distribution,
and
we
would
say
certainly
in
that
case
that
it
is
a
sentencing
decision
for
the
judge
to
make
about
what
was
involved
with
that
particular
offense.
but
it's
a
substantially
difficult
question.
i
can't
honestly
tell
you
what
the
government's
position
would
be
in
this
court
on
the
question
of,
when
it
was
perfectly
clear
what
was
involved
in
that
distribution,
perfectly
clear
that
was
the
only
conviction,
and
then
there
was--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--other
conduct
that
was
sought
to
be
taken
into
account.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
i
don't
think
this
court
has
said--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--i
think
that
under
the
statutes--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--it's
another
question
that's
not
presented,
but
yes,
i
think
under
the
statutes
that
say
that
anything
can
come
under
sentencing--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--in
watts.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
yes,
absolutely.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
well,
it's
not
a
constitutional
question.
it's
a
statutory
question.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
the
point
is,
the
statutory
analysis
proceeds
as
follows.
18...
841(a)
defines
an
offense,
unlawful
acts,
then
(b)
says
as
to
penalties
any
person
who
violates
subsection
(a)
shall
be
sentenced
as
follows.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
then
the
form
of
the
following
phrase
is,
in
the
case
of
a
violation
of
subsection
(a)
involving.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
now,
it's
always
been
the
government's
position,
as
my
colleague
points
out,
that
for
distribution,
simple
distribution,
each
possession
or
distribution
of
each
drug
is
a
separate
offense,
and
it
is
consistent
with
that
to
say
that
if
you're
convicted
of
only
one
substantive
count,
then
when
you
get
to
(b)
what
you
have
to
look
at
is,
what
is
involved
in
that
substantive
count.
what's
different
about
conspiracy
is
that
when
you
come
to
apply
846
in
the
841
context
you're
told
by
846,
okay,
if
they've
conspired
to
commit
an
841
offense
you
need
to...
they'll
be
subject
to
the
same
penalties
as
those
for
841.
the
same...
we
interpret
that
language,
as
have
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
looked
at
this,
to
say,
well,
what
you
are
liable
for
in
the
conspiracy
context
under
pinkerton
and
all
the
vicarious
liability
cases
is
your
conduct
and
the
conduct
of
your
coconspirators
in
furtherance
of
the
conspiracy,
and
so
that
is
the
universe
of
what
you're
liable
for.
you
take
all
of
that,
making
those
findings,
and
then
you
come
up
with
a
number
of
drugs
and
a
quantity
of
drugs,
and
then
you
apply
the
statutory
guidelines
in
effect
that
congress
has
provided
in
841(b).
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
you
understand
our
position,
and
i--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--and
i
would
point
out
that
the
court
reviewed
in
chapman
the
history
of
the
drug
statute.
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
and
one
thing
i
would
point
out
about
that
is,
when
congress
enacted
the
current
form
of
841(b)
in
1986,
what
it
had
in
mind
was
setting
three
broad
categories,
which
were
king
pin
distributors,
serious
street
level
distributors,
and
then
regular
distributors.
and
we
think
it
would
be
odd
if
what
congress
accomplished
through
all
of
this
was
to
say
that
in
a
conspiracy
case,
where
every
normal
principle
of
construction
tells
us
that
when
you're
found
guilty
of
the
conspiracy
you
are
then
liable
for
all
the
conduct
involving
the
conspiracy,
it
would
be
a
passing
odd
result
to
find
that
when
you
apply
that
under
the
statutory
structure
you
end
up
with
something
different.
so
that
if
you
have
somebody
who
has
participated
in
a
long
term,
broad
scale
wide
distribution
conspiracy,
that
suddenly
you
are
limited
at
sentencing
to
taking
into
account
something
other
than
that
conduct.
i
think...
i'd
just
like
to
clear
up
two
persistent
sources
of
misconception,
i
think,
in
this
case.
one--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--for
the
purposes
we
are
centrally
controlled
with
here,
yes,
it
would
be
sufficient.
now,
it
raises
another
set
of
questions,
and
i
think
the
courts
have
consistently
said
that.
they've
said,
well,
an
indictment
is
sufficient
if
it
charges
in
terms
of
the
statute,
and
the
statute
says--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--but...
of
course.
there
are
notice
principles
that
come
in
both
under
the
rules,
under
practice,
and
under
the
constitution
that
require
the
defendant
have
adequate
notice
of
what
he's
being
charged
with
both
for
purposes
of
defense
at
trial
and
for
purposes
of
pleading
and
bar,
and
i
would
point
out
that
there
is
a
whole
body
of
cases
in
the
courts
of
appeals
about
how
you
distinguish
one
conspiracy
from
another
for
purposes
of
double
jeopardy,
and
i
think
that
would
be,
for
instance,
relevant
in
that
context.
if
i
might
just
point
out
that
there's
a
lot
of
talk
about
dual
object
conspiracies
here,
and
it's
a
source
of
a
lot
of
confusion
in
the
briefs
and
i
think,
with
respect,
in
my
colleague's
argument.
the
indictment
here
charged
a
dual
object
conspiracy
in
the
sense
that
it
charged
both
possession
with
intent
and
distribution,
each
of
which
is
a
separate
offense
under
841.
now,
they
happen
to
be
in
this
case
offenses
that
violate
the
same
substantive
statute.
it
did
not
charge
a
dual
object
conspiracy
by
charging
that
there
was
both
cocaine
and
crack
cocaine
involved
in
this
conspiracy.
those
are
means
of
satisfying
the
same
element
of
either
the
distribution
offense
or
the
possession
offense.
they
are
not
objects
of
the
conspiracy,
and
i
think
it's
quite
important,
actually,
conceptually
to
keep
that
in
mind.
the
offense
of
conviction--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--that's
correct,
and
we
know
from
griffin
that
if
there
was
sufficient
evidence
to
convict
on
either
one
of
those,
and
there
clearly
was,
they
conceded
there
was,
the
convictions
are
perfectly
valid.
but
it
is
false
and
misleading
to
say,
oh,
well,
this
is
dual
objects
because
one
object
was
crack
and
one
object
was
powder.
that's
just
not
the
way
it
works.
the
other
thing
is,
the
offense
of
conviction,
which
we
talk
about
both
in
terms
of
841
as
a
statute--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--under
his
view
of
the
world
i
think
that's
right,
and
there
would
be...
there
would
be
more
serious
problems
than
figuring
out
the
sentence,
frankly,
because
i
think
there
would
be
problems
with
convictions,
although
they've
never
stood
up
to
the
plate
on
that
one.
again,
in
view
of
the
offense
of
conviction,
which
is
important,
is
a
conspiracy
to
distribute
controlled
substances,
and
i
think
if
we
look,
as
my
colleague
was
suggesting,
at
the
indictment
and
at
the
statute,
he
said,
well,
if
you
didn't
specify
quantity,
the
maximum
statutory
sentence
would
be
20
years,
and
we
would
quite
strongly
disagree
with
that.
if
you
get
an
indictment
that
charges
you
with
participating
in
a
drug
conspiracy
and
no
quantity
is
specified,
when
you
look
at
the
statute
you
ought
to
be
on
notice...
you
are
on
notice
that
the
maximum
penalty
is
life
in
prison.
it
depends
on
the
quantity,
which
is
something
that
hasn't
been
specified.
now,
you
may
want
to
seek
clarification
of
that
in
one
way
or
another,
but
it
is
not--
mr.
edward
c.
dumont
--they
absolutely
do,
your
honor.
it
is
not
true
that
you
somehow
know
from
that
indictment
that
your
exposure
is
limited
to
20
years.
so
i
might
just
return
to
the
fact
that
there
is
one
real
and
straightforward
issue
in
this
case,
and
the
other...
and
that
is
the
guidelines
issue
that
i
was
dealing
with
earlier,
and
the
circuits
are
in
conflict
on
that
issue,
and
the
court
ought
to
resolve
it
in
the
way
that
we
think
is
plainly
correct
under
watts
and
witte.
the
other
questions
we've
been
considering
are
very
interesting,
and
they
may,
in
fact,
be
difficult
in
some
future
case
that
presents
them,
but
this
case,
when
we
return
to
our
sheet,
is
really
a
very
simple
one,
and
the
judgment
below
ought
to
be
affirmed.
thank
you.
