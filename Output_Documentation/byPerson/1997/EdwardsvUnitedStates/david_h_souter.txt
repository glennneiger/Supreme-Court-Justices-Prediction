justice
david
h.
souter
you
say
by
placing
it
in
851
rather
than
as
one
of
the
subsections
of
841,
you
say?
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
have
851
in
your
appendix?
i
don't
think
you
do,
do
you?
justice
david
h.
souter
okay.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
don't
understand
what
you
just
said.
do
you
want
to
say
it
again?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
of
course,
it
made
no
finding
whatsoever
on
quantity,
so
you
don't
know
that,
either--
justice
david
h.
souter
--as
far
as
the
jury
is
concerned.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
didn't
do
the
math,
but
i...
is
it
correct
that
if
you
draw
this
distinction
between
type
of
drug
and
quantity
of
drug,
and
you
win
your
argument,
and
the
court
says
yes,
the
jury
must
make
the
determination
on
type
of
drug,
is
it
necessarily
the
case
that
all
of
these
sentences
would,
in
fact,
have
to
be...
have
to
be
vacated,
given
the
fact
that
you
let
the
judge
make
the
quantity
determination?
i
guess
my
question
is,
did
the
judge
make
a
quantity
determination
even
with
respect
to
the
lesser
of
the
two
drugs
that
would
support
the
sentences,
or
the
ranges
within
which
he's
sentenced?
justice
david
h.
souter
some
but
not
all?
