mr.
steven
shobat
yes.
mr.
steven
shobat
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
ambiguous
general
verdicts
returned
in
this
case
cannot
support
the
sentencing
court's
finding
that
the
conspiracy
embraced
both
objectives
charged
in
this
dual
object
conspiracy,
the
two
objectives
being
the
distribution
of
powder
cocaine
and
the
distribution
of
crack
cocaine,
and
they
cannot
be
for
four
reasons.
first,
congress
required
the
jury
to
determine
the
type
of
drug
involved
in
the
drug
conspiracy
before
sentence
could
be
imposed
upon
that
object.
second,
the
fifth
and
sixth
amendment
rights
to
a
jury
determination
of
all
the
essential
elements
of
a
conspiracy
requires
the
jury
to
determine
what
the
object
of
the
offense
was,
and
particular
to
the
type
of
drug.
third,
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
permit
punishment
to
be
imposed
in
excess
of
the
statutory
maximum
provided
by
congress
and,
finally,
nothing
in
the
sentencing
guidelines,
to
the
extent
that
they
ever
could,
undermines
these
principles.
with
respect
to
what
congress
intended,
it's
clear
that
in
enacting
section
846
congress
wanted
to
fix
the
maximum
punishment
available
to
a
person
convicted
of
that
section
to
the
offense,
the
object
of
which
the
conspiracy
was
intending
to
accomplish.
mr.
steven
shobat
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
it's
clear
that
congress,
in
listing
the
various
different
factors
in
section
841(b),
intended
that
some
of
them
be
elements
of
the
offense
and
some
of
them
not
be.
congress
made
it
explicitly
clear
in
enacting
section
851
that
the
existence
of
a
prior
conviction
was
one
of
the
factors
listed
in
841(b)
that
should
not
be
considered
by
the
jury,
and
it
did
so
by
removing
it
from
the
jury's
consideration,
placing
it
in
a
separate
statutory
provision,
and
saying
that
the
judge
should
make
that
determination.
it
is
also
clear
that,
in
considering
whether
or
not--
mr.
steven
shobat
--section
851,
your
honor?
section
851--
mr.
steven
shobat
--yes.
by
removing
it
from
the
subsection
of
841(b)
and
placing
it
in
a
separate
statutory
provision,
and
then
having
the
judge,
not
the
jury,
determine...
and
interestingly,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
whether
the--
mr.
steven
shobat
--i'm...
i
don't...
i'm
not
sure
that
it
is
in
the
appendix,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
shobat
but
it
did
remove
that
consideration
from
the
jury.
what
it
did
not
remove
were
the
type
of
drugs
and
the
quantity,
but
it
is
not
necessary
that
those
be
treated
identically
for
purposes
of
an
846
conspiracy,
and
there
are
several
reasons
for
that.
first,
congress
could
well
have
intended
that
a
conspiracy
to
commit
a
specific
objective,
which
is
an
inchoate
offense
which
does
not
require
the
completion
of
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
and
has
separate
elements
from
an
841(a)
conspiracy
to
embrace
a
more
specific
object
than
would,
say,
an
ordinary
841(a)(1)
violation
of
possession,
or
a
distribution.
in
addition--
mr.
steven
shobat
--yes,
your
honor.
a
conspiracy
offense
under
846
is
an
inchoate
offense
and
therefore
the
only
two
elements
that
the
government
need
satisfy
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
for
an
846
offense
is
that
a
conspiracy
with
a
particular
objective
exists
and
that
a
particular
defendant
that
was
being
considered
by
the
jury
be
a
member
of
that
conspiracy.
in
many
conspiracies
there
are
no
actual
drugs
involved,
very
typically,
in
the
case
in
which
the
agents
pose
as
the
sellers
of
drugs
and
they
engage
in
negotiations
and
discussions
with
respective
buyers
and
then
a
seizure
or
a
bust
takes
place,
an
arrest
at
a
planned
exchange
of
drugs
for
money,
and
there
is,
in
fact
no
actual
controlled
substance.
in
that
case--
mr.
steven
shobat
--not
at
all.
not
at
all,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
shobat
absolutely,
it
would
be
a
conspiracy
conviction,
but
now
the
question
becomes,
what
maximum
penalty
did
congress
provide
for
that
conspiracy,
and
the
answer
to
that
question
is,
what
was
their
conspiratorial
objective.
that's
what
congress
expressly
says
in
section
846,
punish
persons
who
agree
to
commit
a
very
specific
object
as
if
they
had
committed
that
object,
and
in
the
case
of
the
type
of
drug,
that
specific...
excuse
me.
in
the
case
of
a
distribution
offense,
that
specific
offense
is
only
knowable
by
reference
to
the
specific
type
of
drug.
mr.
steven
shobat
your
honor,
it
can
be
and,
in
fact,
it's
not
squarely
raised
in
this
case,
but
we
would
submit
that
quantity
could
be
considered
an
element
by
congress.
congress
could
have
intended
it
to
be
an
element,
but
it
isn't
necessarily
the
case.
that
question
isn't
squarely
presented,
we
believe--
mr.
steven
shobat
--justice
breyer,
we're
not
saying
definitively
that
it
is
not
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
steven
shobat
the
argument
is
that
it
might
be
an
element
of
the
offence.
mr.
steven
shobat
we
believe
that
it
is.
however--
mr.
steven
shobat
--yes.
yes.
mr.
steven
shobat
because
congress
intended
it.
mr.
steven
shobat
your
honor,
i
suppose
there
are
two
answers
to
that
question.
the
first
is,
the
question
becomes,
what
is
the
appropriate
punishment
for
an
individual
like
that
who
had
that
agreement?
mr.
steven
shobat
one
of
the
ways
that
we
attempt
to
distinguish
it,
justice
breyer,
is
to
note
that
as
part
of
the
841(a)(1)
elements
the
jury
is
asked
to
conclude
that
the
substance
being
agreed
to
be
distributed
or
manufactured
under
an
841(a)(1)
and
846
offense,
the
jury
is
going
down
the
road
of
determining
and
must
determine
that
the
agreement
impacted
a
controlled
substance.
now,
not
every
substance
is
a
controlled
substance,
so
the
jury
must
make
a
decision,
a
finding,
that
the
particular
substance
contemplated
in
846
was
one
of
the
substances
listed
in
section
(a)(12).
mr.
steven
shobat
that's
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
they
are
asking
themselves,
was
there
an
agreement
to
distribute
a
controlled
substance?
to
know
that,
that
this
is
not
salt
or
sugar,
they
must
come
to
the
view
that
it's
one
of
those
substances
under
(a)(12),
at
least
that
that
was
contemplated
in
this
conspiracy.
that
means
that
the
jury
is
already
going
down
that
road
in
determining
what
the
substance
is.
we
think
that's
distinguishable--
mr.
steven
shobat
--that's
possible
justice
o'connor,
but
in
concluding
that
it
is
a
controlled
substance,
they
are
concluding
that
it
is
one
of
the
substances
identified
in
section
(a)(12),
which
lists
all
the
controlled
substances
there
can
be,
and
so
they're
making
that
finding.
they
may
not
come
out
and
say,
we
find
it
was
cocaine,
or
we
find
it
was
heroin,
but
they
are
saying
we
find
it
was
a
controlled
substance,
and
therefore--
mr.
steven
shobat
--we
submit,
your
honor,
that
the
jury
going
down
that
road
to
make
that
finding,
congress
made
clear
that
that's
the
kind
of
finding
that
the
jury
should
make,
and
that
the
jury
must
make,
and
not
leave
it
solely
to
the
sentencing--
mr.
steven
shobat
--mr.
chief
justice,
we
don't
believe
that
that
is
sufficient,
that
particularly
in
a
case
such
as
this,
where
the
government
charges
not
just
any
controlled
substance
but
a
very
specific
controlled
substance,
that--
mr.
steven
shobat
--i
think
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
government
to
have
charged
simply
a
controlled
substance,
but
i
think
it
would
have
additional
problems
of
its
own.
that
is
to
say,
i
think
there
might
be
a
case
in
which
it's
not
exactly
clear
whether
which
of
the
controlled
substances
a
particular
defendant
conspired
to,
and
in
that
case
the
government
might
not
want
to
commit
that
it
was
particularly
heroin,
or
a
jury
might
be
able
to
conclude,
well,
i
think
it
was
heroin,
or
i
believe
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
it
was
heroin,
i
believe
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
it
was
cocaine,
i'm
not
sure
whether
it
was
marijuana.
under
the
instructions
that
the
judge
gives
me,
i
must
find
this
individual
guilty.
so
that
in
this
case,
the
jurors
could
have
decided
that
these
individuals
conspired
to
distribute
crack
cocaine,
or
they
might
have
decided
that
they
distributed
powder
cocaine.
mr.
steven
shobat
justice
o'connor,
they
would
change
in
the...
for
a
number
of
significant
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
statutory
penalty
is
not
based
on
a
consideration
of
the
guidelines
or
relevant
conduct,
but
it's
based
on
what
was
the
agreement,
what
was
the
offense
of
conviction,
so
that
if
the
offense
of
conviction
were--
mr.
steven
shobat
--that's
not
the
offense
that
was
charged
in
this
case,
and
we
would
submit
that
to
know
what
the
statutory
maximum
penalty
is,
that
there
needs
to
be
a
determination
as
to
the
type
of
drug.
after
all,
the
differential
in
the
punishment
between
the
two
objects
was
100
to
1.
100
grams
of
powder
cocaine
is
treated
equivalently
under
the
guidelines...
excuse
me,
under
the
statutory
penalty
as
the
same
as
1
gram
of
crack
cocaine,
and
that
was
why
the
particular
problem
that
arises
in
this
case
is
especially
important,
depending
on
which
objective--
mr.
steven
shobat
--that's
a
very
difficult
question
to
answer,
justice
scalia,
because
the
indictment
in
this
case
charged
no
specific
threshold
quantity
in
terms
of
giving
us
notice
as
to
the
particular
drug.
under
the
indictment...
the
government
suggests
in
its
brief
that
we
should
just
simply
look
at
the
indictment
and
look
at
the
statute,
and
that's
how
we
know
our
maximum
penalty.
if
that's
in
fact
the
standard,
looking
at
this
indictment,
in
which
there's
no
specific
quantity
or
threshold
quantity
even
alleged,
no
reference
to
any
subsection
under
841(b),
the
maximum
penalty
is
20
years
for
that
type
of
offense
and
when
there's
a
schedule
1
or
schedule
2
narcotic
involved,
so
the
maximum
penalty
would
be
20
years.
but
what
happened
in
this
case
is
that
at
sentencing
the
judge
made
some
findings
with
regard
to
a
different
sort
of
conspiracy,
that
is,
one
which
embraced
both
the
crack
cocaine
and
the
powder
cocaine,
made
specific
findings
about
exact
amounts,
of
type
of
drug,
and
quantity,
and
determined
that
with
respect
to
some
of
the
petitioners
the
maximum
was
life
imprisonment,
but
with
respect
to
other
petitioners
the
maximum
was
40
years.
mr.
steven
shobat
well,
if
it
was
crack
the
maximum
would
also
be
20
if
the
sole
basis
for
determining
the
maximum
punishment
is
to
look
at
the
indictment
and
to
read
the
statute.
that's
what
the
government
says
you
should
do,
but
in
reality,
what
the
district
court
did
was
not
simply
look
at
the
indictment.
what
the
district
court
said
is,
quantity
determinations
are
mine
to
make,
and
so
once
i
make
these
quantity
determinations,
that
alters
the
maximum
penalties.
mr.
steven
shobat
what
the
judge
must
do
in
that
case
is
first
determine
what
the
statutory
penalty
is.
it
first
must
say
to
itself,
what
was
the
offense
of
conviction,
and
once
it
determines
that...
let's
say
there
were
negotiations,
recorded
conversations,
and
it
appeared
that
the
person
was
trying
to
acquire
5
kilograms
of
crack.
mr.
steven
shobat
in
that
case,
the
only
way
that
a
sentencing
judge
could
determine
what
the
maximum
penalty
would
be,
first
under
the
statute
is
to
make
a
finding
as
to
what
the
amount
was,
or
at
least
what
the
threshold
amount
was.
that
is,
was
it
more
than
50--
mr.
steven
shobat
--was
it
more
than
5
kilos--
mr.
steven
shobat
--in
the
event
the--
mr.
steven
shobat
--in--
mr.
steven
shobat
--exactly,
and
it
also
depends,
then,
on
the
type
of
drug,
and
if
he
doesn't
know
the
type
of
drug,
then
there
is
absolutely--
mr.
steven
shobat
--well,
there's
nothing
wrong
with
that
if
he
knows
what
the
threshold
quantity
is.
mr.
steven
shobat
i
don't
believe--
mr.
steven
shobat
--that
you're
exactly
correct,
because
in
this
statute,
under
this
specific
statute
the
statutory
maximum
changes
based
on
not
only
the
type
of
drug
but
the
threshold
quantity
of
drugs
involved
in
the
offense.
mr.
steven
shobat
that
the
possible...
generally
most
of
them
fall
within
a
statutory
maximum.
mr.
steven
shobat
we're
complaining
about
that,
but
we're
also
complaining
about
the
particular
charge
in
this
case
and
the
way
the
jury
was
instructed,
because
what
we
don't
know
is
what
the
offense
of
conviction
was.
we
don't
know
whether
this
jury
determined...
because
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
could
find
either
powder
cocaine
or
crack
cocaine
as
an
objective
and,
given
that
instruction,
we
don't
know
whether
the
jury
found
that
this
was
a
powder
cocaine
conspiracy,
a
crack
cocaine
conspiracy,
or
perhaps
both.
mr.
steven
shobat
we
don't
know
that.
mr.
steven
shobat
we
don't
know
that.
all
the
findings
that
happened
that
fixed
the
sentencing
occurred
right
on
the
eve
of
sentencing,
during
the
sentencing
process.
mr.
steven
shobat
i
think
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
yes,
that
it
would
necessarily
affect
some
of
the
petitioners.
each
of
the
five
petitioners--
mr.
steven
shobat
--some
but
not
all,
and
it
would
necessarily
affect
all
of
them
in
determining
first
what
the
statutory
maximum
penalty
is.
remember
that
the
sentencing
judge
utilized
the
sentencing
guidelines
and
said,
here's
what
i
conclude
everybody
is
held
accountable
for.
considering
that
the
offensive
conviction
embraced
both
objectives,
his
findings
as
to
what
was
relevant
conduct
or
what
amounts
should
be
attributable
would
be
vastly
different
if
he
were
to
analyze
this
from
the
question
of
what...
if
the
conviction
was
merely
a
powder
cocaine
conspiracy.
mr.
steven
shobat
no,
your
honor.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
it
could
find
the
defendants
guilty
if
they
found
either
cocaine
or
powdered--
mr.
steven
shobat
--there
was
no
objection
to
that.
it's
our
position,
however,
your
honor,
that
since
the
government
brought
the
dual
object
conspiracy,
and
since
the
government
wanted
to
seek
punishment
on
the
higher
objective...
that
is,
the
objective
carrying
the
higher
penalty...
that
it
was
incumbent
upon
them
to
seek
such...
either
a
special--
mr.
steven
shobat
--that's
correct,
and
the
only
way
we
would
complain
about
what
the
jury
determine...
excuse
me,
about
what
happened
at
trial
is
if
the
government
tried
to
take
what
resulted
and
say,
but
we...
the
judge
concludes
that
what
you
were
convicted
of
was
a
crack
conspiracy
conviction.
that,
we
say,
is
completely
impermissible,
particularly
when
the
statutory
penalties
for
powder
cocaine
are
significantly
less
than
those
for
crack
cocaine.
mr.
steven
shobat
under
the
sentencing
guidelines
that's
absolutely
correct.
that
is...
that...
it
would
not
be
true,
however,
in
fixing
the
statutory
penalty,
but
we
acknowledge
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
witte
and
watts,
that
the
juge
is
free
to
consider
a
wide
range
and
not
just
simply
say,
well,
i
thought
about
it,
but
actually
to
make
the
findings
required
under
the
sentencing
guidelines...
but
that
is,
again,
a
guideline
determination.
in
this
case,
there
were
no
statutory
maximum
penalty
determinations
made.
what
the
judge
did
is
just
do
the
guideline
analysis
and
then
say,
based
on
these
guideline
results,
i'm
now
determining
what
the
statutory
maximum
was.
mr.
steven
shobat
mcmillan
supports
our
position,
your
honor
because--
mr.
steven
shobat
--in
mcmillan
there
was
no
increase
in
the
statutory
maximum
penalty.
the
only
increase
was
in
a
mandatory
minimum
so
that
the
visible
possession
of
a
firearm
in
mcmillan
caused
there
to
be
a
minimum
of
5
years
imposed
but
did
not
in
any
way
increase
the
statutory
maximum.
mr.
steven
shobat
we
think
that
they're
bad,
but
the
reason
they're
not
worse
in
part,
i
think,
lies
in
the
power
of
a
sentencing
judge
to
grant
an
upward
departure.
the
statutory
maximum
provides
protection
to
a
defendant
to
prevent
a
sentencing
court
from
going
beyond
the
statutory
maximum.
in
this
case,
had
there
been
a
reason
to
grant
an
upward
departure,
for
example,
with
respect
to
petitioners
joiner
or
edwards,
who
received
a
10-year
sentence,
they
might
have
gotten
a
20-year
sentence
if
that
were
the
statutory
maximum
for
them.
if
they
had
been
considered
to
have
the
same
statutory
maximum
as
petitioner
fort,
who
had
a
life
maximum,
then
it
would
be
very
significant
to
know
that,
even
if
there
was
an
upward
departure
granted
in
this
case,
it
would
not
exceed
20
years
and
risk,
you
know,
possibly
a
life
sentence.
and
so
under
mcmillan,
the
reason...
one
of
the
reasons
we
say
that
this
is
an
essential
element
of
the
offense
is
because
it
not
only
alters
the
range,
but
it
alters
the
statutory
maximum
penalty.
mr.
chief
justice--
mr.
steven
shobat
--yes,
your
honor.
the
jury--
mr.
steven
shobat
--the
jury
could
have
been
instructed
as
it
was
that
you
could
find
either
or,
but
then,
in
addition,
the
jury
should
have
been
asked
which
do
you
find,
either
powder,
crack,
or
perhaps
both.
mr.
steven
shobat
yes,
and
then
there
would
be
a
jury
determination
as
to
what
the
object
of
the
conspiracy
was.
mr.
steven
shobat
it...
yes,
your
honor.
it
is
the
logic
of
our
position
that
the
government
is
free
to
do
that
and,
in
fact,
they
are
doing
that
every
day
with
respect
to
distributions.
in
fact,
the
government
in
response
to
defense
arguments
that
you
can't
do
that,
that
violates
double
jeopardy,
crack
and
cocaine
are
the
same
thing,
the
government
has
said
no,
crack
cocaine
and
powered
cocaine
are
different
substances.
they
can't
be
punished
consecutively,
or
cumulatively,
and
now
in
this
case
the
government
is
saying,
oh,
no,
it's
really
just
a
controlled
substance.
and
so
we
think
that's
a
significantly
inconsistent
position
that
the
government
is
taking,
we
acknowledge
that
that
is
possible
to
be
done.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
i
have.
mr.
steven
shobat
mr.
chief
justice,
the
issue
that
is
not
before
the
court
is
the
guideline
issue.
quite
frankly,
this
case
doesn't
raise
the
concerns
of
the
guidelines.
it
raises
the
question
of
the
statutory
maximum
and
the
offense
of
conviction,
and
that's
the
starting
point.
even
before
the
district
court
could
proceed
to
the
question
of
the
sentencing
guidelines,
it
had
to
know
what
the
offense
of
conviction
was,
and
it
had
to
know
what
the
statutory
maximums--
mr.
steven
shobat
--the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
mr.
steven
shobat
it's
really,
we
don't
know,
but
it's
very
likely
that
it
is
no.
mr.
steven
shobat
well,
what
the
government
has
relied
upon,
your
honor,
is
the
findings
of
the
court
after
having
considered
the
defendants
of
being...
of
having
been
convicted
of
a
conspiracy
that
we
don't
know
that
they
were
convicted
of,
and
so
now,
after
the
fact,
we
have
a
determination
by
the
sentencing
court.
if
the
judge
were
to
look
at
this
anew
and
say
the
conspiracy
of
which
they
were
convicted
was
powdered
cocaine
distribution,
then
the
court
might
say,
well,
i
think
the
amount
of
powdered
cocaine
is
less
than
i
previously
attributed
to
this
conspiracy
because
then
i
thought
the
conspiracy
embraced
both
crack
cocaine
and
powder
cocaine.
after
all,
in
this
conspiracy
there
were
quantities
of
powder
cocaine
that
were
converted
into
crack
cocaine
and,
for
example,
with
respect
to
petitioner
wintersmith,
he
was
held
accountable
for
540
grams
of
powder
cocaine.
if
just
40
grams
of
that
substance
were
attributable
to
the
crack
conspiracy...
that
is,
that
part
of
the
conspiracy
that
had
to
do
with
converting
the
powder
to
crack
and
selling
it
out
of
a
drug
house...
just
diminution
of
that
40
grams
would
mean
that
his
maximum
penalty
was
20
years.
now,
he
received
a
sentence
of
21
years,
less
than
the
40-year
maximum
that
would
have
been
applied
at
a
500-gram
level,
and
so
we
think
that
the
similar
analysis
applies
to
each
of
the
petitioners
in
varying
degrees.
certainly
with
regard
to
some
of
the
petitioners
there
was
more
evidence,
there
was
a
greater
involvement
in
the
conspiracy,
and
that
is
the
central
problem
with
these
dual
object
conspiracies.
the
government
could
potentially
bring
a
case
which
has
very
strong
evidence--
