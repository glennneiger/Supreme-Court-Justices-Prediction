mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
given
the
presentation
in
the
first
half-an-hour
i'm
not
sure
i'm
going
to
gild
this
lily
at
great
length,
but
a
couple
of
points
seem
to
me
to
warrant
attention
at
this
stage.
first,
justice
breyer,
in
response
to
your
question,
the
industry
amicus
brief
talks
about
the
problems
that
arise
in
the
bankruptcy
setting
and
the
fact
that
there
are
lots
of
lenders
who
end
up
not
being
able
to
recover
anywhere
near
the
full
amount
of
the
outstanding
loan
in
the
rescission
context,
so
that's
some
evidence
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--as
i
under...
because
the
principal
of
the
loan
is
essentially
an
unsecured
debt--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
question
is
going
to
be
then,
as
a
matter
of
equity,
whether
the
tender-back
rule
has
to
be
applied
in
the
first
instance
or
whether
the
bankruptcy
protections
ought
to
apply
in
the
first
instance,
and
i
think
a
lower
court's
probably
divided
with
respect
to
that
particular
question--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
we
know
in
the
bothelo
case--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
but
the
bothelo
case
was
the
one
case
in
which
that
actually
happened
and
they
did,
in
fact,
eliminate
the
tender-back
requirement
in
its
full
measure.
that's
the
only
one
i
know
about
that's
cited
in
the
briefs
and
that's
a
bankruptcy
case,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
where
their
case
stands
at
this
point,
we
begin
with
the
language
of
the
statute
and
section
1635
says
as
plainly
as
it
can
that
the
right
that
the
petitioners
seek
to
assert
here
expired,
and
it
expired
in
1989,
and
they
came
in
1991
and
they
sought
to
raise
it
again.
and
what
they
were
able
to
do
in
1991,
that
they
were
able
to
do
specifically
because
of
section
1640,
is
they
were
able
to
get
actual
compensatory
damages
and
they
were
able
to
get
statutory
damages,
in
point
of
fact,
even
though
the
statute
of
limitations
on
violations
of
tila
had
already
run,
and
that's
because
congress
was
very
careful
in
devising
the
remedial
scheme
that
it
adopted
here.
it
recognized
that
that
was
an
equitable
response
that
frankly
tracked
this
court's
decisions
in
bull
and
reiter
v.
cooper
and
western
pacific.
congress
recognized
that
that
was
equitable
to
allow
the
borrower
under
those
circumstances
to
come
in
and
to
assert
that
particular
right,
and
they
received
that,
and
the
question
which
justice
o'connor
began
the
argument
with
i
think
is
really
the
one
that
we
have
to
focus
on.
under
these
circumstances,
where
you've
received
full
recompense,
what
sense
does
it
make
for
congress
to
go
further
and
ask
you
to
grant
a
right
of
rescission,
and
the
petitioners
say
that
we
have
to
find
something
in
the
statute
that
says
you
cannot
have
a
right
of
rescission,
and
we
submit
to
you
that
the
more
reasonable
assessment
of
the
equities
of
the
relationship
between
the
parties
is,
we
ought
to
be
looking
in
this
statute
for
some
evidence
that
a
right
of
rescission
in
recoupment
should
exist
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
justice
breyer,
i
can't
improve
on
your
characterization
of
what
probably
happened
in
congress,
which
is
that
somebody
identified
the
possibility
of
a
state
law
right
in
rescission
and
recoupment
and
the
congress
quite
rightly
reacted
negatively
and
said,
wait
a
second,
in
this
subsection
we
certainly
don't
mean
to
withdraw
any
of
those
kinds
of
state
remedies.
remember,
this
is
a
statute
that
is
very
solicitous
of
state
law
in
general,
and
all
of
these--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
it
would
have
made
more
sense
if
they
had
simply
said
state
law
rescission
and
recoupment.
again,
i
think
all
they
wanted
to
make
clear
of
was
that
state
law
would
be
protected.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
there
is
a
reference
to
that
language
in
one
of
the...
actually,
one
of
the
earlier
florida
cases,
where...
it's
not
actually
that
language,
but
there
is
recoupment
action,
and
they
do
talk
about
rescission,
but
you
know,
our
footnote
6
in
our
brief
goes
to
great
lengths...
we
looked
in
vain
for
this
to
try
to
figure
out
where
congress
came
up
with
this
particular
animal
and
frankly
couldn't
find
it.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
always
reluctant
to
press
that
as
the
basis
for
interpretation,
your
honor.
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
[laughter]
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
rescission
or
recoupment
under
state
law?
it
depends
on
whether
state
law
applies
to
both.
you
see,
i
think
it's
clear--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
still
think
that
congress
would
have
meant
for
state
law
to
apply
to
both,
so
it
wouldn't
have
made
a
difference.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
i'm
not
arguing
it
would
be
preempted,
but
i
do
think
it's
important
in
that
regard,
a
la
justice
scalia's
question
about
a
remand
in
this
case,
is
that
the
first
half
of
the
florida
supreme
court's
opinion
analyzes
the
federal
statutory
issue.
the
second
half
of
it
analyzes
it
as
a
matter
of
state
recoupment
law
and
conclusively
says
that
in
our
judgment
this
kind
of
a
statute
is
not
the
kind
of
a
statute
in
which
we
would
exercise
recoupment
and
therefore,
as
a
matter
of
state
law,
there's
no
basis
for
recovery.
that's
over
and
above
the
fact
that
they've
never
asked
for
recovery
under
state
law
at
any
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
never
asserted
itself,
to
this
day.
i
mean,
there
is
a
single
sentence
in
the
reply
brief
in
which
they
make
reference
to
seeking
rescission
under
state
law.
there's
no
support
for
it
in
the
citations
in
the
reply
brief
and
there's
nothing
in
the
record
and
actually
i
heard
counsel
for
petitioner
today
to
effectively
concede
that
the
complaint
clearly
says
nothing
about
state
law,
and
nothing
else
arose
throughout
this
litigation
in--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--absolutely.
absolutely,
because
at
the
end
of
the--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--that's
correct,
justice
o'connor,
because
the
question
that
was
certified
to
the
florida
supreme
court
was
whether
or
not
there
was
this
kind
of
a
right
under
state
law,
and
if
you
look
at
the
joint
appendix
on
164
to
165,
the
last
line
of
164
says,
after
analyzing
all
of
the
traditional
grounds
for
statutory
interpretation
as
to
why
this
provision
doesn't
grant
a
federal
right
it
says,
but
that
does
not
end
our
inquiry,
and
then
it
turns,
in
florida,
and
i
take
the
rest
of
that
analysis
really--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
see
anything
in
the
court's
opinion
that
remotely
suggested
that
to
be
the
case,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i...
no
question
about
it,
mr.
chief
justice,
it
doesn't
include
that
question,
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right.
yes,
justice
stevens.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
right,
but
the
bottom
line
is,
in
terms
of
i
think
what
is
before
this
court,
is
simply
a
question
of
federal
law
and
i
think,
based
on
all
that's
happened
today,
the
question...
the
federal
question
of
law
is
unmistakable.
that
is,
the
right
expired.
there
is
nothing
in
this
statute
that
remotely
revives
that
right
and
certainly
nothing
in
(i)(3),
which
as
i
think
we've
discussed
now
at
sufficient
length,
which
simply
retains
certain
protection
for
state
law.
it
was
a
peculiar
way,
if
all
you're
trying
to
do
is...
if
what
you
were
really
trying
to
do
was
to
revive
a
federal
right
that
you
categorically
declare
to
be
expired,
this
is
not
the
way
you'd
do
it,
and
therefore
i
don't
think
that's
a
fair
interpretation
of
that
language
of
the
statute.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'll
waive
back
the
rest
of
my
time.
