unknown
speaker
is
right
of
rescission
in
recoupment,
is
that
a
term
peculiar
to
florida
law,
or
is
that
how
we
speak
of
it
generally?
i
always
thought
it...
recoupment
as
simply
being
offset
to
damages,
but
rescission
is
an
action
of
an
equitable
nature.
i
don't...
and
your
brief
talks
in
the
same
way.
you
seem
to
conflate
the
two
terms.
unknown
speaker
well,
can't
we
say
that
without
coupling
it
with
the
term
of
recoupment,
or
does
that
somehow
help
your
case
to
talk
about
recoupment?
unknown
speaker
the
statute
itself
talks
about
rescission
in
recoupment?
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
under
the
statute
i
guess,
regardless
of
the
timing
of
the
discovery
of
a
failure
to
comply
with
tila,
that
the
homeowner,
your
client,
in
effect,
could
in
any
event
obtain
damages
that
result
from
whatever
failure
to
disclose
was
involved,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
without
any
time
limit
on
that.
you
can
get
actual
damages.
unknown
speaker
and
also
twice
the
amount
of
any
finance
charge.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
available
without
time
limit.
unknown
speaker
but
your
client
asserts
in
addition
a
right
to
rescind
and
recover
all
of
the
interest
paid
for
the
period
of
time
that
the
mortgage
was
in
effect
and
payments
were
made
on
it,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
yes.
i
mean,
it
could
have
been
20
years
of
payment
under
the
mortgage,
presumably--
unknown
speaker
--when
you
discover
there's
some
$7
deficiency
here.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
that
would
be
enough,
wouldn't
it--
unknown
speaker
--under
your
theory?
unknown
speaker
well,
no
matter
how
small
the
failing,
and
this
was
pretty
small,
and
no
matter
how
much
time
has
elapsed,
it's
your
position
that
there's
this
indefinite
right
of
rescission
to
get
back
all
of
the
interest
paid,
in
addition
to
the
damages
and
in
addition
to
the
statutory
penalty,
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
what
we're
here
to
decide.
i'm
not
a
bit
sure
that's
what
they
said,
but
that's
your
position.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
can
i
ask
just
one
other
detailed
practical
question?
you
do
have
to
tender
back
the
amount
of
the
loan
to
principal,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
and
your
client
is
here
in
forma
pauperis,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
does
he
have
the
money
to
do
that?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
you
are
so
stressing
the
word
rescission...
you
say
that's
used
over
repeatedly,
and
yet
congress
used
such
distinctly
different
language
in
dealing
with
the
1-year
time
limit
for
damages.
it
says
no
action
should
be
brought,
traditional
statute
of
limitations.
here,
it
talks
about
the
right
to
rescind
shall
expire.
one
sounds
like
it's
simply
a
typical
statute
of
limitations
and
you
can
raise...
and
defensively
you
can
recoup.
the
other,
it
sounds
like
expire,
dead,
over,
after
3
years
it's
gone,
and
you
make...
how
do
you
explain
that
congress
picked
this
word
expire
to
describe
the
right
of
rescission,
and
then
talking
about
the
1-year
limitation,
used
traditional
statute
of
limitations
language?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
so,
but
what
is
there
in
the
statute
that
indicates
that,
and
anything
that
indicates
that
it's
only...
the
same
thing...
what
you're
saying
is,
it
is
the
same
thing
as
the
extension
of
the
statute
of
limitations,
which
doesn't
count
if
you're
seeking
only
to
recoup.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
can
i
ask
you
about
that?
do
you
want
us
to
determine
what
florida
law
says?
i
mean,
let's
assume
we
agree
with
you
as
to
the
meaning
of
(i)(3),
should
we
determine
that
there
is
such
a
right
of
rescission
in
recoupment
under
florida
law?
unknown
speaker
you
would
want
us
to
remand--
unknown
speaker
--to
let
the
florida
supreme
court
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
so
is
that
the
most
you're
asking
for?
unknown
speaker
a
right
to
remand
to
let
the
florida
court
decide
whether,
under
florida
law,
there
is
such
a
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
wait,
wait,
wait.
that's
not
what
it
says.
it
says,
under
state
law,
affects
a
consumer's
right
of
rescission
and
recoupment
under
state
law.
unknown
speaker
but
i
mean,
florida
may
decide
that
this
is
a
peculiar
sort
of
an
action,
this
rescission
action,
for
which
it
will
not
allow
recoupment.
is
that
not
within
the
realm
of
permissibility?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
it
say
under
state
law,
then?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
it's
a
matter
of
federal
law
they
could
have
left
out
the
phrase
in
(i)(3)
nothing...
it
could
have
just
said,
nothing
in
this
subsection
affects
a
consumer's
right
of
rescission
and
recoupment,
period.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
care
about
the
caption.
i'm
talking
about
the
text.
we
don't
go
by
captions.
we
go
by
the
text.
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
they
say
that
under
federal
law
there
can
be
no
state
law
of...
right
of
rescission,
and
you
say
that's
wrong,
but
can't
we...
if
we
send
it
back,
couldn't
they
still
find
that
under
state
law,
regardless
of
what
the
federal
law
said,
we
don't
think
this
is
the
kind
of
matter
on
which
there
should
be
recoupment?
unknown
speaker
okay--
mr.
rogow--
--but
it's
a
question
of
florida
law.
unknown
speaker
and
what
you
say
is
neutral
principles
of
florida
law
may
not
be
what
the
florida
supreme
court
thinks
are
neutral
principles.
unknown
speaker
may
i
clarify
one
thing,
mr.
rogow,
because
i
think
we
lost
a
piece
of
this
that's
essential.
i
think...
you
said
at
the
very
beginning
that
the
bank
agrees
there
is
a
right
to
rescission
in
recoupment,
whatever
you--
unknown
speaker
--but
solely
under
state
law.
that
is,
as
justice
scalia
asked
the
question,
the...
there
is
a
concession,
whatever,
that
whatever
florida
law
would
be
apart
from
tila,
tila
doesn't
exist,
if
there's
a
right
to
rescission
under
state
law
that
would
apply
here,
but
i
think
you're
urging
the
double...
the
two
things.
that
is,
you
must
get
tila
into
it,
otherwise
there's
no
difference
in
your
position.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you're
right
about
tila
having
this
right
of
rescission
in
recoupment,
then
why
do
you
need
the
provision
that
talks
about
state
law?
you've
got...
you
say
that
under
tila
in
3
years
or
10
years,
it
doesn't
matter,
you
can
rescind
if
you're
sued.
now,
what
extra
does
this
add?
if
you
have
your
right
under
federal
law,
then
what
does
the
addition
of
the
state
law--
unknown
speaker
--it's
not
a
matter
of
preemption.
it's
a
matter
of
ultimate
source.
you're
saying,
i
think,
that
the
obligation
to
make
these
disclosures
and
to
make
these
calculations
correctly
arises
under
federal
law.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
for
that
federal
law
congress
has
provided
a
remedy
for
breach,
rescission,
but
it
says
it
can
only
be
for
3
years.
unknown
speaker
so
it
seems
to
me,
as
justice
ginsburg
is
indicating,
you're
trying
to
have
it
both
ways,
but
that's
quite
different
from
saying
that
there
is
simply
a
state
law
cause
of
action.
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
section...
subsection,
or
double
subsection
(3)
of
1635(i),
which
says
nothing
in
this
subsection
affects
a
consumer's
right
of
rescission
in
recoupment...
that
does
not
give
any
federal
right.
unknown
speaker
it
leaves...
well,
it
leaves
open
the
possibility
that
the
state
may
give
you
a
right.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
your
federal
right
of
rescission
goes
when
it
says
an
obligor's
right
of
rescission
shall
expire
3
years
after
the
date
of
consummation.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
that
is
your
right
of
rescission
under
this
statute.
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
mean,
affirmatively
rescind?
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
affirmatively
rescind.
unknown
speaker
and
that's
a
state
law
right.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rogow,
did
the
petitioner
ask
for
a
rescission
remedy
as
a
matter
of
state
law
in
the
proceedings
below?
unknown
speaker
but
not
state
law--
unknown
speaker
--rescission.
that
was
not
raised.
unknown
speaker
why
is--
--may
i...
no,
please.
may
i
go
back,
though,
to
an
earlier
question.
leaving
aside
the
fact
that
the
word
affirmative
does
not
appear
in
1635(f),
how
do
you
explain
the
distinction
between
the
shall-not-be-brought
language
with
respect
to
the
damages
remedy,
which
sounds
like
a
normal
statute
of
limitations,
and
the
shall-expire
language
with
respect
to
this
rescission
right?
what
is
the
reason,
in
effect,
that
i
think
you're
telling
us
we
should
ignore
that
distinction?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
my
question
is,
why
shouldn't
it
make
some
difference?
the
shall...
the
shall
not
be
brought
is
standard
limitation
language.
shall
expire
is
not,
and
on
its
face
it
suggests
that
in
fact
a
distinction
is
being
made,
and
i
don't
know
why
we
should
ignore
that
distinction
in
language
and
find
it
of
no
significance,
and
i
don't
think
you've
answered
that.
unknown
speaker
well,
(i)(3)
doesn't
have
to
be
read
that
way.
cannot
(i)(3)
refer
to
state
law
recoupment
permissions
that
do
not
rely
upon
this
federal
statute?
that
is
to
say,
if
the
same
failure
to
provide
information
under
this
federal
statute
also
constitutes
a
fraud
under
state
law,
this
provision
can
be
read
to
say,
recoupment
and
rescission
for
that
fraud
is
not
affected
by
our
3-dyear
termination
of
the
rescission
for
violation
of
this
act.
unknown
speaker
violation
of
the
act
is
also
a
fraud.
unknown
speaker
no,
it
need
not
only
be
read
that
way.
i'm
saying,
when
you
put
that
together
with
the
indication
that
justice
souter
was
just
referring
to,
the
indication
that
they
use
language
different
from
the
statute
of
limitations,
those
two
go
together
very
nicely.
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
rogow
why
isn't
the
word
expire
here?
i
mean,
i
dimly
recall
learning
in
law
school
that
there
were
two
kinds
of
time
bars.
one
extinguished
the
remedy,
and
that's
no
action
shall
be
brought,
and
one
was
supposed
to
extinguish
the
right,
and
that
was
the
right
terminates,
not
just
the
remedy.
now,
that's
what
the
difference
in
language
triggered
in
my
mind
immediately,
that
expire
sounds
like
the
one
you've
got
no
more
right,
and
the
other
is,
well,
too
bad
you
can't
sue
on
it.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
your
argument,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
reason
(i)
revives
it
is
that
(i),
in
effect...
or
state
law
looks
to...
would
look
to
federal
law,
and
specifically
this
act,
but
when
federal...
when
state
law
does
look
to
federal
law
under
this
act,
what
it
sees
is
what
justice
ginsburg
just
described.
it
sees
language
that
seems
to
say,
with
respect
to
the
1635
right,
it
expires,
so
whether
(i)
is
there
or
whether
(i)
isn't
there,
you've
got
to
deal
with
the
expire
language
and
i
do
not
see
that
the
formulaic
incorpora...
or
reservation
of
state
law
has
any
bearing
one
way
or
the
other
on
the
significance
of
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
did
they
take
a
vote
on
that,
the
whole
congress
said
we
do
not
want
these
statutes?
unknown
speaker
just
a
committee,
right?
unknown
speaker
did
the
whole
congress
reject
the
bill?
unknown
speaker
those
bills
were
never
presented
to
the
whole
congress,
were
they?
unknown
speaker
but
it
says
in
so
many
words
that
it
shall
expire.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
affirmative,
mr.
rogow.
you've
been
putting
that
word
in
front
of
rescission
all
during
this
argument
and
the
statute
simply
doesn't
say
it.
unknown
speaker
is
the...
i'm
back
with
justice
kennedy.
that
is,
this
seems
like
such
an
odd
legal
animal,
rescission
in
recoupment.
i
don't
understand
what
it
is,
that...
is
there
any
other
place
it
exists
in
the
law?
my
understanding
is
that
if
you
give
me
$2,000...
suppose
you
gave
me
$2,000,
and
i
was
supposed
to
give
it
back
to
you.
i
never
did,
and
you
forgot
about
it.
20
years
later,
i
sue
you
for
$10,000
on
something
else,
and
even
though
there's
a
statute
of
limitations
you
could
say,
wait,
breyer
has
my
$2,000.
deduct
it
from
the
10.
that's
recoupment,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
well,
by
analogy
that
would
here
permit
the
borrower,
the
homeowner
to
deduct,
when
20
years
later
they
try
to
foreclose
on
the
mortgage,
the
bank
tries
to
get
its
money
back,
it
would
permit
him
to
deduct
however
much
he
was
hurt
by
a
failure
to
disclose,
but
everybody
concedes
he
gets
that.
now
what
he
wants
is
something
more.
he
wants
something
he
never
gave
me.
he
wants
me
not
to
collect
any
interest
over
20
years,
so
that
doesn't
sound
like
anything
to
do
with
recoupment,
and
it's
something
else.
it's
like
a
penalty
or
something.
so
is
there...
if
tila
never
existed,
if
you
look
across
all
state
law,
is
there
any
other
instance
you
came
across
where
something
like
that
sounded
as
if
it
was
part
of
recoupment?
it
just
doesn't
sound
like
recoupment.
everybody's
saying,
rescission
in
recoupment.
i
know
it's
written
in
a
statute,
but
i
want
to
know,
is
this
like
a
normal
legal
animal,
or
is
it
something
they
invented
out
of
tila,
or
where
did
it
ever
come
from?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
if
it's
nowhere
else
in
the
law,
and
if
it
starts
out
by
saying,
nothing
in
this
subchapter
shall,
you
know,
have
any
effect
on
something
called
rescission
and
recoupment,
then
it
sounds
like,
if
nothing
in
this
subchapter,
then,
forget
it,
it's
gone,
because
there
is
no
such
thing.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it's
possible...
you
know,
you
go
to
congress,
people
get
all
mixed
up
and
somebody
comes
and
tells
them
there's
something
called
rescission
in
recoupment
under
state
law,
and
everybody
says
well,
we
don't
want
to
touch
that.
i
mean--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you
just
to
comment
on
one
thing
before
you
sit
down,
mr.
rogow?
it's
a
point
that
i
came
across
and
i
thought
i
answered
it,
and
then
it
occurred
to
me,
maybe
i
didn't.
you've
mentioned
1635(i)(3).
what
i
have
in
mind
is
the
significance
of
1635
(i)(1).
i
could
read
it,
but
you
probably
know
it.
does
that
have
any
significance
for
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
it's
referring
to
the
right
which
occurs
at
the
time
of
foreclosure.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
a
defensive...
i
assume
it's
a
defensive
right
which
functionally
is
being
employed
in
the
same
way
that
you're
arguing
the
general
rescission
right
should
be
employed.
unknown
speaker
okay--
unknown
speaker
--i
have
a
technical
question.
if
they
do
rescind
30
years
later,
the
borrower,
does
he
actually
have
to
tender
the
value
of
the
money,
or
is
it
that
the
bank
simply
has
a
legal
claim
to
the
value
of
the
principal?
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say...
in
other
words,
is
it
possible
that
30
years
later
the
homeowner
comes
back
and
says,
yes,
you
are
entitled,
bank,
to
my
original
principal,
$100,000.
by
the
way,
i'm
in
bankruptcy,
and
you
don't
have
any
security.
good
luck.
i
mean,
has
that
happened?
is
that
possible,
in
your
interpretation
that
would
happen?
unknown
speaker
no,
ever
in
the
country?
i
mean,
i'm
trying
to
figure
out--
unknown
speaker
--so
they'd
actually
have
to
have
the
$100,000
and
give
it
back
to
the
bank,
otherwise
they
couldn't
do
the
rescission.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
reason
why
a
borrower
would
act
within
3
years
instead
of
just
sitting
back,
once
he
knows
there's
been
a
mistake
in
the
original
transaction,
and
waiting
for
foreclosure?
meanwhile,
he's
using
the
money
interest-free.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
the
court
could
also
take
into
consideration
the
fact
that
there's
a
provision
in
here
that
mere
computational
errors
in
fact
do
not
support
any
rescission
right
at
all.
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
that
surprises
me
about
this
case
is
what
is
described
as
the
error
here
sounds
like
somebody's
adding
machine
mistake
to
me,
and
i
presume
that
if
the
bank
comes
forward
and
affirmatively
shows
that
that's
the
case,
this
whole
discussion
is
academic,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
phillips,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
why
would
that
be?
i
mean,
that's...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
legally
why
would
that
be?
if,
in
order
to
rescind,
the
homeowner
has
to
tender
back
the
principal
of
the
loan,
why
would
the
bank
not
get
the
principal
of
the
loan?
that's
what
was
confusing
me.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
tendering
back,
i
take
it,
means
like
you
have
a
certified
check
and
you
hand
it
to
the
bank,
and--
unknown
speaker
--that's
what
i
found
out.
it
sounds
to
me
this
is
an
empirical
question
that
should
have
an
answer--
unknown
speaker
--and
it
doesn't
sound
to
me
as
if
people
know,
particularly.
unknown
speaker
his
argument
i
think
was,
look
at
the
language.
it
says
nothing
in
this
subsection
affects
a
consumer's
right
of
rescission
in
recoupment
under
state
law.
he
says,
that's
an
odd
legal
animal.
the
only
thing
he's
ever
found
that
that
exists
is
this
kind
of
a
case,
so
congress
must
have
had
something
in
mind,
and
if
they
didn't
have
this
thing
in
mind,
which
distinguishes
between
affirmative
rescissions
and
rescissions
later
on
in
recoupment,
what
could
they
have
had
in
mind,
so
it's
either
meaningless,
or
what
he
says.
that's
what
i
take--
unknown
speaker
--florida--
--do
you
think
there's
any
possibility
that
congress
meant
rescission
or
recoupment?
rescission
in
recoupment
just
sounds
crazy
to
me
and
it
would--
unknown
speaker
--make
perfect
sense
if
it
said
rescission
or
recoupment.
unknown
speaker
but
is
there
such
an
animal
in
state
law
as
rescission
in
recoupment?
unknown
speaker
nobody
thought
of
the
possibility
of
a
scrivener's
error?
unknown
speaker
if
it
said
or--
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
--how
would
the
case
come
out
if
it
said
or?
unknown
speaker
and
what's
the
answer
to
that?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
phillips,
as
i
understand
your
position,
you're
just
saying
there's
no
federal
right
here,
but
i
don't
think
you
take
the
position
that
if
florida
said
we're
going
to
treat
even
a
trivial
violation
of
tila
as
a
ground
for
state
law
rescission,
you
aren't
saying
that
it
would
be
preempted--
unknown
speaker
--well,
that's
the
other
point
i
was
going
to
ask
is,
when
did
their
claim
for
a
state
law
recoupment
first
assert
itself?
i
didn't
find
it
in
the
early
opinion.
unknown
speaker
but
you
think
that
nonetheless,
as
you
read
the
opinion
of
the
florida
supreme
court,
it
rejected
any
state
law
recovery,
right?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it
wasn't
requested.
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
think
that
the
florida
court
thought
that
it
was
simply
not
at
liberty
to
confer
some
state
law
right
of
rescission
on
the
theory
that
tila
had
preempted
state
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
question
presented
here
is,
may
an
action
for
the
statutory
right
of
rescission
provided
by
tila
be
revived
as
a
defense
in
recoupment
beyond
the
3-year
limit
on
the
right
of
rescission
set
forth
in
section
13...
1635(f).
i'm
not
sure
that
even
includes
that
question.
unknown
speaker
that
certainly
wasn't...
that
wasn't
the
question
framed
in
the
petition.
unknown
speaker
we
rewrote
the
question.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
not
what
they
present...
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
mr.
rogow,
you
have
1
minute
remaining.
