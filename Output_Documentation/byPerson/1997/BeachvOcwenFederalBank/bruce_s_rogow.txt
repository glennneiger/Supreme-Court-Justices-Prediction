mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ocwen
bank
agrees
that
there
is
a
right
of
rescission
in
recoupment
after
3
years.
ocwen,
however,
says
that
that
right
in
recoupment
is
a
state
safety
net,
that
one
can
rescind
in
recoupment
only
if
there
is
fraud
or
duress
or
coercion
under
state
law
principles.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
kennedy,
rescission
in
this
situation
is
statutory
rescission,
and
i
think
it's
important
to
note,
too,
that
the
right
to
rescind
within
3
years
is
not
an
action
in
rescission
under
the
truth-in-lending
law.
it
is
merely
sending
a
notice
of
rescission
within
the
3
years.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
helps
our
case
to
talk
about
recoupment
and,
indeed,
1635(i)(3)
talks
about
rescission
in
recoupment,
a
statute
that
the
supreme
court
of
florida
absolutely
ignored
in
this
analysis.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
under
state
law,
but
the
caption
of
(i)(3)
is
the
right
to
recoupment
under
state
law,
and
then
the
statute
says,
nothing
in
this
section
shall
affect
the
right
to
rescission
in
recoupment
under
state
law.
ocwen
suggests
that
that
only
means
state
law
rescission
for
fraud,
duress,
or
coercion,
and
our
position
is,
is
it
means
more
than
that.
it
means
the
federal
truth-in-lending
act
right
to
rescission,
and
several
reasons
support
our
position.
the
first
is
the
notion
that,
when
one
looks
at
this
statute,
the
word
rescission
used
throughout
the
statute
is
federal
tila
rescission,
and
this
court's
decision
last
week
in
national
credit
union
reasserted
a
principle
that,
when
one
looks
at
statutes
and
the
same
words
are
used
throughout
the
statute,
then
the
word
has
the
same
meaning,
and
here
the
word
rescission
is
used
throughout
section
1635
and
it
is
referring
to
tila
rescission,
truth-in-lending
act
rescission,
so
under
that--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--that
is--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--you
can
get
actual
damages,
justice
o'connor,
and
statutory--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--a
statutory
penalty
with
a
maximum...
in
this
case
it
was
$1,000,
and
there
was
$1,000,
in
effect
a
penalty
under
1640,
plus
the
overcharge,
and
plus
another
amount
of--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--that
is
available.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
right,
justice
o'connor,
recover
the
interest
paid,
on
the
other
hand
have
to
pay
back
the
principal.
the
rescission--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
could
be--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
a
$7
deficiency--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--no,
it
would
not--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
wouldn't
be
enough,
justice
o'connor,
because
under
congress'
construct
it
would
have
to
be
more,
but
i
think
the
answer
to
this
is...
because
i
understand--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
because
congress
has
said
that
is
right,
because
the
remedy--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--that
is
our
position,
justice
o'connor,
but
we
think
it's
informed
by
how
one
construes
these
statutes.
beginning
with
the
first
point
that
i
make,
congress
certainly
has
said
rescission
in
recoupment,
nothing
in
this
section,
which
would
be--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
at
this
moment,
of
course,
he
doesn't
have
the
money
to
do
that
and
what
happens
in
these
cases
generally
is,
is
that
if
the
right
to
rescission
is
invoked,
then
the
borrower
is
entitled
to
the
return
of
the
interest,
but
the
borrower
has
to
pay
the
principal
back.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
and
in
some
situations,
indeed,
if
one's
house
has
appreciated
in
value,
you
can
then
refinance
your
house
and
pay
back
the
principal.
but
i
think
the
important
thing
here,
justice
stevens,
is
is
that
whatever
the
remedy
is,
is
a
remedy
that
congress
has
constructed
not
as
a
penalty
to
the
lender,
but
to
force
the
lender
to
conform
to
the
truth-in-lending
law.
the
truth-in-lending
law,
its
purpose
is
to
protect
consumers.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
two
ways,
justice
ginsburg.
the
first
is
the
right
that
expires
is
the
right
to
affirmatively
rescind.
that
right
that
they're
talking
about
is
the
right
within
3
years
to
say
to
the
lender,
i
am
rescinding
this
transaction.
that
is
the
right
that
expires.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
ginsburg,
(i)(3)
says
the
right
to
rescission
in
recoupment
shall
not
be
affected
and
is
available
under
state
law,
so
even
if
one
looks
at
1635(f),
the
shall
expire
language,
that
is
revived
by
(i)(3).
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no,
justice
scalia.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes,
because--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
is.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
to
let
the
florida
court
decide
whether
or
not,
under
florida
law
properly
applying
federal
law.
the
difficulty
with
the
supreme
court
of
florida
decision
was--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
says
the
right
to...
the
caption
of
it
says,
the
right
to
recoupment
under
state
law.
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
florida
permits
recoupment
under
state
law
and
whether
or
not
it
would
permit
rescission.
florida,
in--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
is
not
if
it
misapplies
federal
law.
the
supreme
court
of
florida--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
because--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--in
(i)(3),
the
caption,
i
come
back,
that
says
the
right
of
recoupment
under
state
law--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
the
right
of
rescission,
justice
scalia,
is
the
right
of
rescission...
tila
rescission
and
state
law
rescission.
what
ocwen
is...
ocwen
agrees
there
is
a
right
of
rescission.
they're
claiming
that
that
right
of
rescission
is
strictly
a
state
law
right
of
rescission,
and
when
one
reads
a
supreme
court
of
florida
opinion,
it
is
driven
by
its
view
that
congress
has
said
that
there
shall
be
no
right
of
rescission
under
federal
law.
that's
the
heart
of
our
argument,
that
was
a
mistake.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
not
if
they
applied
neutral
principles
of
florida
law,
because
florida
law
permits
rescission
in
recoupment--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it's
an
ultimate
question
of
florida
law
applying--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
they
would
not
be
if
the
florida
supreme
court
properly
addressed
1635(f).
by
misconstruing
1635(f)
and
1635(i)(3)
the
supreme
court
of
florida
came
to
the
conclusion
really
on
two
foundations,
1)
that
1635(f)
is
a
statute
of
repose.
the
right
shall
expire.
it
failed
to
address...
indeed,
it
said
that
(i)(3)
is
not
even
relevant
to
this
inquiry,
and
clearly--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
exactly
right.
our
position
is,
is
that
1635
(i)(3)
embraces
tila
rescission
and
state
law
rescission.
it
leaves
the
door
open--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
makes
it
clear
that
federal
law
is
not
preempting
the
field,
but
rescission
in
recoupment
under
state
law
would
also
be
available
for
fraud,
duress,
or
coercion.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
does,
justice
kennedy.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
says
it
can
only
be--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
what
we're
saying,
justice
kennedy,
is...
and
the
supreme
court
of
florida
came
to
the
conclusion
that
there
is
no
federal
right
to
rescission
after
3
years.
if
they
are
wrong
about
that,
then
their
decision
is
not
properly
informed,
and
that's
what
we're
arguing,
that
they
are
wrong
about
that.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
leaves
open
the
door
to
the
federal
right.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
certainly
leaves
open
the
state
giving
you
a
right,
but
it
does
not
preclude,
and
i
think
that's
the
key
to
this
case,
is
it
does
not
preclude
the
use
of
the
federal
right.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that's
1635(f).
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is
your
right
to
affirmatively--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--by--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--when
one
reads
1635(a)
and
1635(b)
in
that
section,
they're
talking
about
sending
a
notice
of
rescission
within
3
years,
affirmatively
rescinding.
we
are
talking
about
rescinding
in
recoupment,
something
that
happens
after
3
years
when
one
has
been
sued
in
foreclosure.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is,
if
state
law
permits
recoupment,
then
there
is
a
right
to
rescission
and
the
question
is,
which
right
to
rescission,
state
law
rescission,
or
state
law
rescission
and
the
federal
tila
rescission?
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
as
a...
the
petitioner
raised
1635
rescission,
which
was
federal
rescission.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
at
the...
that's
right.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
was
not,
and
at
the
time
(i)(3)
was
not
in
existence
when
the
petitioner
filed
his...
his
and
her
affirmative
defenses,
so
they
were
relying
upon
the
right
to
rescission,
which
every
court
that
had
addressed
this
since
1984
found
that
there
was
a
right
to
rescission
in
recoupment
after
3
years.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
the
cases,
bull,
reiter,
western
pacific,
clearly
make
it
plain
that
congress...
only
the
clearest
congressional
language
would
prevent
a
statute
of
limitations
from
being
used
in
recoupment,
and
the
language
here,
shall
expire,
is
being
read
now
as
something
other
than
a
statute
of
limitations.
i
don't
think
the
nomenclature
makes
any
difference
in
this
situation.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i
think,
justice
souter,
that
the
answer
lies
in
(i)(3),
that
if
one
views,
as
is
right,
as
having
expired,
then
(i)(3)
revived
it
by
its
language
that
leaves
open
the
notion
that
there
can
be
rescission
in
recoupment.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
but
the
question--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--but
the
question,
justice
scalia,
is
whether
or
not
it
can
only
be
read
that
way.
congress
had
the
opportunity--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--but
the
supreme
court
of
florida
said
it
can
only
be
read
one
way,
and
that,
we
think,
is
their
error.
it
can
be
read...
unless
there's
clear
language
that
says
there
is
no
rescission
in
recoupment
under
reiter,
bull,
and
western
pacific,
then
the
court
should
conclude
that--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
(i)(3)
addresses
that
when
it
says
that
nothing
in
this
section,
which
includes
the
3-year
limitation
which
is
referred
to
in
section
(i),
shall
affect
the
right
to
rescission
in
recoupment
under
state
law,
so
while
that...
your
reading
would
be
the
usual
reading,
the
fact
that
(i)(3)
is
added
to
this
changes
this
from
being
that
kind
of
statute
of
repose
where
the
right
has
expired,
died
as
often
is
suggested,
into
something
that
now
has
been
revived.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
justice
souter,
congress
had
the
opportunity
to
make
it
specific
that
there
will
be
no
rescission
in
recoupment.
the
aarp
brief
has
in
its
appendix
the
four
different
bills,
i
think
it
was,
that
were
offered
to
accomplish
what
ocwen
is
now
asking
this
court.
congress
rejected
that.
congress
did
not
include
that
language
that
made
it
clear
that
this
right
shall--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--no,
but
by--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--but
by
rejecting
the
bill,
justice
scalia,
by
rejecting
the
bill--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
in
terms
of
how
congress
voted,
obviously
the
end
result
was
(i)(3).
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
they
did
not
come
out
of
committee,
but
in
this
legislative
process
there
has
been
no
showing
by
congress
that
this
is
what
it
intended,
that
this
right
shall
expire.
i
think
it's--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--it
does
for
the
affirmative
right
to
rescind--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--justice...
chief
justice
rehnquist,
by
talking
about
that
right
in
that
section
they
are
dealing
specifically
with
that
affirmative
right
to
rescind
within
3
years.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
the
lender
controls
everything
here.
if
the
lender
conforms
to
federal
law,
then
there
is
no
potential
for
rescission.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
that
is,
justice
breyer.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i'm
not
aware
of
it
anywhere
else,
justice
breyer,
but--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
then
i
think
those
words
would
be
meaningless,
the
(i)(3)
language
would
be
meaningless.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
well,
this
was
considered
and
it
was
rejected,
and
i
think
two
points
i
want
to
make
before
i
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
is,
is
that
not
only
do
the
lenders
have
the
right
to
cure
this
defect,
because
they
can
cure
it
and
therefore
render
them
not
liable
in
rescission
in
recoupment,
but
they
can
conform
to
the
law.
and
i
think
the
beginning
point
of
this
is,
this
is
a
unique
statute.
it
is
a
consumer
protection
statute.
it's
to
inform
and
project
the
consumer,
and
rescission
is
not
a
penalty.
it
puts
the
parties
back
in
their
original
position.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
no.
those
provisions
in
1635(i)
give
the
consumer
a
right
to
rescind
within
3
years
in
certain
conditions
and
the
1995
amendments
actually
limited
the
right
to
rescission.
this
made
clear
that
there
was
a
right
to
rescind
within
those
3
years
for
those
reasons.
a
mortgage
broker
fee
was
not
disclosed,
those
kinds
of
things.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
yes.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
it
is,
within
3
years,
but
that
doesn't
address
recoupment,
and
recoupment
is
addressed
in
(i)(3)--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--and
(i)(4)
makes
it--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--well,
there
are
equitable
principles
here,
and
the
court
could
adjust
the--
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
--there
is
no
record
of
that
happening.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
i'm
not
aware
of
any,
justice
breyer.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
the
rescission
requires
a
give-and-take.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
because
if
that
were
a
strategic
default,
then
under
equitable
recoupment
principles
and
even,
indeed,
under
the
rescission
principles,
the
court
could
take
into
consideration
if
there
were
some
bad
faith
in
the
way
the
borrower
had
addressed
this.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
you
would
only
have
the
right
to
rescind
if
there
have
been
material
disclosure
errors
that
the
court
found
were
in
clear
violation
of
tila,
yes,
justice
souter.
mr.
bruce
s.
rogow
several
things.
the
florida
supreme
court
opinion
clearly
is
premised
on
its
view
that
under
1635
there
is
no
right
to
rescission,
and
that
informed
its
view
of
state
law
also,
and
that's
at
page
171
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
courts
that
have
looked
at
this...
dawes,
colorado,
massachusetts,
new
york,
new
jersey,
illinois...
have
all
decided
that
there
is
a
right
to
rescission
in
recoupment
consistent
with
the
federal
tila
right
that
could
be
asserted
affirmatively
within
the
first
3
years.
this
court
has
talked

an
equitable

and
throughout
the
life
of
the

ability
to

without
clear
congressional
language
saying
there
shall
be
no
recoupment,
there
is
recoupment
in
rescission,
and
florida
permits
rescission
in
recoupment
and
it
should
have
permitted
it
in
this
case
under
federal
law.
