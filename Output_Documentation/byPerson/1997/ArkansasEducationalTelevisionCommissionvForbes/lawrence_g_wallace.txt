mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
governmental
entity
puts
on
a
law
day
program
utilizing
invited
speakers
who
are
not
themselves
government
officials
or
employees,
no
one
would
think
that
advocates
of
terrorism
or
anarchy
could
not
be
excluded
from
participation
as
speakers.
viewpoint
neutrality
is
not
required,
because
forum
analysis
does
not
apply
to
the
government's
own
expressive
presentations
to
the
public.
forum
analysis
is
instead
designed
to
address
situations
where
the
government...
where
government
property
or
facilities
are
dedicated
to
use
for
private
speech
and
the
government
is
acting--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
mere
fact
that
non-government
participants
are
invited
to
participate
in
the
government's
expressive
activities
does
not,
i
would
argue,
turn
that
into
a
forum
where
the
government
is
acting
only
in
a
regulatory
capacity
with
respect
to
private
speech
to
which
it's
dedicated
its
facilities.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
the
government...
the
communications
act
prohibits--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
an
incumbent
running
for
reelection
can
espouse
his
own
political
cause.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
he
may
work
that
into
his
official
statement.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
that
is
our
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
as
far
as
protecting
speech,
it's
hard
to
see
why
that
would
violate
the
first
amendment
when
a
government
official
is
speaking.
it
may
be
something
we
would
consider
improper--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--not
at
all.
the
last
section
of
our
brief
shows
why
that
standard
is
met
here
in
light
of
the
special
verdicts
of
the
jury
exception,
but
we
happen
to
think
that
that
is
the
correct
analysis.
it
is
commonplace
for
non-government
participants
to
enrich
government
expressive
presentations.
common
examples
are
the
commencement
speaker
at
a
state
university,
a
visiting
exhibition
at
the
state
art
museum,
the
authors'
works
that
are
published
by
the
state
university
press,
a
lecture
series
that's
given
at
the
state
museum--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--those
are
not
forums
at
all.
those
are
government
presentations.
they're
a
form
of
publishing
by
the
government.
they
don't
give
rise
to
a
right
of
access
under
the
first
amendment
by
other
people
who
would
like
to
use--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
obviously
views
will
be
stated
that
are
the
individual's
own
views,
but
the
speaker
has
been
selected
to
contribute
to
the
government
program,
and
the...
it's
the
difference
between
government
regulation
or
suppression
of
speech
whether
the
government
is
required
to
publish
speech
by
those
who
would
like
to
use
the
government's
way
of
publishing
in
one
way
or
another
and
participate
in
the
same
way,
and
the
same
principles
apply
where
a
television
station
happens
to
be
licensed
to
a
government
entity,
that
they
are...
under
the
communications
act
a
broadcast
licensee
is
a
trustee
responsible
for
selecting
programs
that
will
meet
the
needs
of
the
community
it
is
licensed
to
serve,
and
it
will
fulfill
that
obligation
by
selecting
programming
that
may
originate
with
a
private
entity
that
gives
the
program--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
the...
if
you
once
start
applying
forum
analysis
that...
it
gives
access
rights
to
a
government
publication
and
their
speech.
if
the
station
is
carrying
the
metropolitan
opera
broadcast
does
that
mean
a
composer
has
some
enhanced
right,
if
his
opera's
not
being
broadcast
on...
at
the
met,
to
have
access
to
the
station,
to
use
the
station's
facilities
to
have
his
opera
heard?
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
but
we
think
that
the
principles
that
apply
in
news
broadcasting
are
doing
the
same
thing.
if
there
is
an
interview
on
the
evening
news
hour
of
private
commentators
to
comment
on
a
terrorist
act
that
occurred
that
killed
people,
it
isn't
necessary
to
include
a
spokesman
for
the
terrorist
group
among
those
asked
to
be
commentators.
this
is
part
of
the
government's
own
presentation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
think
that
would
be
a
closer
case,
because
we
don't
have
the
same
obligation
of
the
licensee
who's
entrusted
to
use
this
frequency
to
serve
the
needs
of
the
community
to
exercise
the
control
over
the
programming
presented.
it's
a
much
more...
it's
a
much
closer
case.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
the
licensee
is
responsible,
in
using
the
frequency,
to
select
the
programming
that
it
determines
will
serve
the
needs
of
that
community.
that
is
the
scheme
of
the
act
under
which
it's
operating,
and
it
can
decide
that
broadcasting
news
excerpts
from
the
campaign
speeches
of
major
candidates
is
something
worthwhile
to
do.
it
can
make
the
same
judgment
about
how
a
debate--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there
are
rules
that
apply
under
the
communications--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--as
long
as
it's
a
government
program,
it's
clear
that
this
is
something
that
the
government
is
putting
on
for
the
benefit
of
the
public,
the
government
can
choose
who
shall
be
participants,
what
private
person
shall
be
a
participant,
what
private
person
shall
not
be.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
has
to
meet
equal
protection
standards.
it
cannot
engage
in
invidious
or
irrational
discrimination.
