unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
not
necessarily.
it
all
depends
on
the
analysis
that
we
follow,
and
you
have
to
ask
whether
this
is
closer
to
a
situation
of
the
state
speaking,
as
such,
or
a
situation
of
letting
candidates
speak.
i
mean,
it
may
fall
on
one
or
the
other
side
of
the
line.
unknown
speaker
i
assume
here
that
the
station
was
intending
to
let
the
candidates
speak.
the
station
wasn't
trying
to
put
words
in
their
mouths.
unknown
speaker
no,
and
did
the
station
set
in
advance
here
the
rules
that
it
eventually
came
up
with
when
there
was
a
third
candidate?
unknown
speaker
when
it
opened...
when
it
first
decided
to
have
the
debate,
as
i
understand
it,
it
just
said
we're
going
to
let
the
candidates
for
this
office
come
here
and
have
a
debate.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
occurred
after
this
third
party
candidate
appeared
and
said,
i
want
to
talk,
too.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
thought
that
was
what
emerged
eventually
in
response
to
the
request
of
mr.
forbes
to
participate,
but
was
that
laid
out
in
all
its
complexity
at
the
outset?
unknown
speaker
no.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
assume
that
this
decision
was
parallel
to
what
a
private
network
would
do
with
a
similar
debate
in
a
similar
format.
is
that
in
the
record,
or
do
i
just
judicially
know
that,
or
is
that
important
for
the
case,
or--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
mean,
other
stations,
privately
owned
stations
can
surely
do
things
that
your
station
is
not
allowed
to.
could
your
station
endorse
a
candidate?
unknown
speaker
let's
assume
that's
not
there.
as
a
constitutional
matter,
would
your
station
be
able
to
endorse
a
particular
candidate
for
public
office?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
thought
it
was.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i
know
it's
not
this
case.
i'm
asking
you,
if
399
were
not
there,
would
your...
would
a
publicly
owned
station
as
a
constitutional
matter
be
able
to
endorse
a
political
candidate?
unknown
speaker
under
forum...
i'm
not
talking
about
creating
a
forum.
i'm
just
talking
about
a
publicly
owned
station
that
comes
out
and
says
we
endorse,
you
know,
the
republican
or
the
democratic
candidate
for
this
district.
now,
a
private
broadcaster
can
certainly
do
that,
can
he
not?
unknown
speaker
but
is...
do
you
think
a
public
broadcaster--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
would
be
interested
in
hearing
you
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
which
you
haven't
done
yet.
if
the
station
wished
to
endorse
a
candidate,
could
it
have
done
so
under
the
constitution,
without
regard
to
any
statutory
provision?
unknown
speaker
under
the...
some
equal--
unknown
speaker
--protection
doctrine,
or
the
first
amendment?
that
they
couldn't
do
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
to
tie
that
in
to
where
we
were
before
i
asked
the
question,
the
mere
fact
that
you're
using
standards
that
a
private
broadcaster
would
use,
and
that
you're
doing
nothing
more
than
what
a,
you
know,
a
private
station
would
do,
you're
not
behaving
in
a
politically
biased
manner,
you're
just
behaving
like
a
good
broadcaster,
that
doesn't
help
your
case,
because
there
are
some
things
that
private
broadcasters
can
do
that
you
can't
do,
and
maybe
this
is
one
of
them.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that...
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
but
can
your
answer
be,
and
could
we
look
at
this
case
as
saying
that
we
look
at
different
programs
to
determine
what
the
first
amendment
rules
are,
and
we
look
on
a
program
by
program
basis,
or
do
the
same
rules
have
to
apply
to
every
part
of
the
station's
ownership,
management,
and
control
in
broadcasting,
i.e.,
hypothetical
about
endorsement,
hypothetical
whether
you
can
hire
all
democrats
or
all
republicans
for
the
editorial
board
and
so
forth?
we
look
at
the
precise
function
that's
in
question,
i.e.,
the
conduct
of
debate.
is...
would
that
be
a
way
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question,
and
would
that
be
an
adequate...
is
there
adequate
precedent
for
us
to
decide
this
case
on
that
sort
of
analysis?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
private
broadcasters
might
think
those
elements
were
desirable,
or--
unknown
speaker
--being
responsible
wouldn't
allow
you
to
endorse
one
of
the
candidates
for
the
office
even
if
you
had
criteria,
we
will
not
endorse
any
candidate
unless,
and
you
set
out
the
criteria.
it
may
be
very
responsible.
it
may
be
very
objective,
even,
but
that
doesn't
prove
that
the
government
can
do
it,
the
mere
fact
that
it's
objective
and
responsible.
you
wouldn't
allow
an
endorsement
of
a
candidate
to
proceed
on
that
basis.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
on
the
record
in
this
case,
could
they...
just
to
take
the
other
side
of
justice
scalia's
question,
could
they
announce
that
we
don't
want
you
to
vote
for
forbes?
don't
waste
your
time
listening
to
him,
or
voting
for
him,
concentrate
on
the
two
major
candidates?
in
other
words,
a
reverse--
unknown
speaker
--a
disendorsement
of
him.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
it
an
invidious
discrimination
for
state-owned
agents
to
say,
we
just
think
this
guy
is
off
the
wall,
we
don't
think
you
should
waste
your
time
with
him,
and
if
all
that
is
true,
it's
invidious
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
why
isn't
what
you
did
viewpoint
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
because
you
had
a
lot
of
neutral
rules
out
there
that
are
not
in
writing
anywhere,
but
governed
exactly
how
you'd
handle
the
debate.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
they
don't
tell
us
whether
he
would
have
been
permitted
to
debate
if
he
could
have
gotten
12
percent
of
the
vote
instead
of
2
percent,
do
they?
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
simply
a
way
of
saying
that
the
distinctly
minority
candidate
always
loses?
because
i
presume
newsworthiness
is
a
measure
of
the
interest
of
the
public
in
the
candidate,
and
if
the
judgment
is
made
by
the
station
that
this
candidate
is
a
loser,
is
never
going
to
garner
anything
but
a
small
minority,
and
therefore
is
not
newsworthy,
then
the
minority
candidate
always
loses,
and
why
isn't
that
a
pretty
darned
good
surrogate
for
viewpoint
discrimination?
the
viewpoint
is
unpopular.
unknown
speaker
isn't
it
true
that
you
put
both
party,
major
party
candidates
on
even
though
one
has
a
tiny
percent
and
so
is
not
of
much
interest
to
the
public?
unknown
speaker
may
i
return
to
justice
o'connor's
question
about
what
these
standards
of
newsworthiness
were?
there
was
nothing
written
down
in
advance,
and
so
why
isn't
this
like
the
legions
of
cases
that
have
come
up
with
a
government
official
allowing,
say,
a
permit
for
a
parade
with
no
standards
at
all,
and
then
after
a
request
is
made,
may
be
coming
up
with
a
set
of
reasons?
generally
in
this
area,
hasn't
the
court
required
at
least
that
there
be
clear
standards
written
down
going
in?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know
about
the
league
of
women
voters,
but
we
are
talking
about
whatever
else
they
are,
they
are
government
actors.
unknown
speaker
if
you
have
integrity,
you're
not
a
state
actor?
is
that
the
principle
that
you're
trying
to--
[laughter]
could
she
refuse
to
allow
someone
on
account
of
their
race--
unknown
speaker
--clearly
she's
a
state
actor
in
that
sense.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
the
question
is
what's
permissible
for
a
state
actor,
not
whether
or
not
she
is
or
is
not
a
state
actor.
unknown
speaker
well,
who
said
it
was
a
nonpublic
forum?
i
thought
that
was
what
we
had
to
decide,
and
here
the
station
chose
to
open
up
a
debate
to
selected
candidates.
i
mean,
that
sounds
a
lot
like
a
limited
public
forum
to
me,
not
a
nonpublic
forum.
i
guess
we
have
to
resolve
that,
don't
we?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
selectivity
alone
means
that
it
can't
be
a
limited
public
forum?
unknown
speaker
i
hadn't
thought
so.
what
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
want
to
know
whether
this
was,
as
we
would
characterize
it,
in
some
of
the
cases
from
this
court,
a
limited
public
forum,
or
is
it
a
nonpublic
forum,
and
do
we
determine
that
based
solely
on
the
fact
that
candidates
were
selected
by
the
station
to
participate?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
must
say,
although
i
played
a
part
in
cornelius,
i
think
that
can
be
cited
for
both
sides,
because
it
certainly
doesn't
determine
this
case,
i'm
afraid.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
we
can't
hear
very
well
right
now.
i--
--you're
speaking
quite
clearly
but
i
think
it's
the
microphone.
i
think
the
microphone
isn't
working.
it's
not
your
problem.
it's
not
working.
so
you'll
have
to
speak
up,
i'm
afraid.
unknown
speaker
yes,
very
well.
very
well.
unknown
speaker
well,
when
you
say
intent,
mr.
marks,
you
mean,
what
was
the
intent
of
the
person
planning
the
program?
did
they
simply
mean
to
turn
it
over
to
the
candidates,
or
did
they
mean
to
plan
something
that
was
more
like
a
debate
where
they
had
more
control
over
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
marks,
maybe
i
misapprehend
this,
so
tell
me
if
i
do,
but
my
notion
of
a
nonpublic
forum
was
a
closed
circuit
like
the
teachers
in
the
school,
like
the
federal
employees
who
are
being
solicited,
that
that...
but
this,
whatever
else
it
is,
it
is
for
the
public.
the
debates
are
for
the
public,
not
for
a
group
of
schoolteachers,
not
for
a
group
of
public
employees,
so
i
was
thinking
that
whatever
it
is,
it
isn't
a
nonpublic
forum.
unknown
speaker
can
i
just
ask,
what
was
[inaudible]
reporters
in
advance
decided
what
the
subjects
are,
decided
what
the
questions
will
be,
and
they
asked
the
questions
to
the
candidates
in
a
very
narrow
area.
what
was
the
nature
of
this
debate?
unknown
speaker
but
i've
looked
at
that,
of
course,
and
i
can't
figure
it
out
just
on
the
basis
of
that.
unknown
speaker
so
far
in
looking
through
the
record
i've
not
been
able
to
find
out
what
the
debate
[inaudible]
a
matter
of
public
record
was
the
broadcast,
what
was
the
format?
unknown
speaker
and
how
many
journalists
were
there
and
how
did
they
work
out
their
questions?
unknown
speaker
mr.
marks--
--thank
you,
mr.
marks.
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
a
candidate
debate
is
sort
of
exactly
that.
the
station
says
we
want
the
candidates
for
this
office
to
come
out
and
have
a
debate
so
the
public
gets
to
hear
them
and
communicate
with
them
on
their
views.
i
mean,
why
isn't
that
a
public
forum?
of
course
a
university
or
a
station
can
have
programs
and
teach
what
it
wants,
but
when
they
choose
to
set
a
candidate's
forum
that's
highly
expressive
and
communicative
with
the
public,
why
isn't
that
different?
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
i'm
not
sure
i
even
agree
with
your
premise
that
if
this
were
not
a
forum,
that
if
the
government
were
just
speaking
on
its
own,
at
least
where
it's
speaking
in
the
realm
of
partisan
politics,
do
you
think
the
government
could
come
in
and
say,
you
know,
we
want
you
folks
to
consider
the
republican
party
and
the
democratic
party.
this
other
party
is
an
irresponsible
party.
you
think
a
government
station
can
do
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
we're
not
talking
about
the
communications
act,
mr.
wallace,
you
know.
we're
talking
about
the
constitution.
as
i
understood
your
position,
you
think
it
is
constitutional
so
long
as
the
government
is
making
its
proposal
itself
for
the
government
to
come
and
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
you
know,
consider
the
republican
candidate
and
the
democratic
candidate.
this
other
party
is
irresponsible.
you
think
the
government
can
do
that?
i
don't.
unknown
speaker
oh,
he's
not
speaking
as
a
government
official
when
he
does
that.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
suppose
the
president
is
regarded
to
be
viewpoint
neutral
or
anything
like
that,
when
he
speaks,
and
certainly
he's
the
top
government
official.
unknown
speaker
but
the
attorney
general
can
do
it?
you
think
the
attorney
general
can
come
out
and
say,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
i
want
you
to
consider
voting
republican.
you
know,
the
government's
paying
for
the
radio
time,
and
the
attorney
general
can
come
out
and
say
that?
i
find
that
astounding.
unknown
speaker
do
you
lose
this
case
if
this
is
a
designated
public
forum?
unknown
speaker
none
of
those
are
nonpublic
forum?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it's
rather
dangerous
to
say
that
at
a
commencement
address
the
government
is
the
speaker.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can
reach
that
conclusion
without
saying
the
licensed
entity
is
a
government
speaker.
unknown
speaker
probably
not,
but
nonpublic
forum
analysis
is
quite
capable
of
making
that
distinction.
unknown
speaker
mr.
wallace,
suppose
we
had
a
town
hall
that's
devoted
to
debates,
and
we
have
a
debate
there
among
candidates,
and
the
town
leaders
say,
we
want
the
debate
to
exclude
all
third
party
candidates,
is
there
any...
is
that
okay,
too?
are
you
talking
about
anything
that's
peculiar
to
radio/television?
unknown
speaker
why?
you
just
said
that
there's
less
control
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
public
interest
in
the
hall
than
in
the
radio/tv
setting.
unknown
speaker
but
let's
just
talk
about
debates,
because
to...
i
thought
that
chief
judge
arnold
made
it
pretty
clear
he
was
talking
about
debates
and
nothing
else,
so
we
have
the
debate
in
the
town
hall
and
the
debate
on
the
government
station,
and
you
say
there
are
different
rules
that
would
apply
to
each?
unknown
speaker
no.
let's
stay
with
the
constitution,
and
my
question
is
particularly,
in
either
case
would
you
need
rules
going
in
so
you
could
check
on
the
integrity
of
the
government
official?
unknown
speaker
and
it
doesn't
need
any
kind
of
reasons,
even
post
hoc--
unknown
speaker
--thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
shackelford,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
shackelford,
one
of
the
suggestions
that's
been
raised
is
that
if
in
fact
the
state
is
limited
in
what
it
can
do
here,
the
state
will
be
limited
in
what
it
can
do
almost
universally
throughout
its
broadcasting,
including
news
broadcasts
and
so
on.
what's
your
answer
to
this
slippery
slope?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
news...
i...
all
right.
you
get
your
list
out.
then
i
have
a
question.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
interrupt
with
this
one
question?
wouldn't
all
those
considerations
also
apply
to
a
policy
of
interviewing
people
on
a
sunday
news
program
where
you
want
to
ask
them
what
they
think
of
the
latest
bombing
over
in
some
place?
unknown
speaker
no,
right
before
the
election
the
only
people
they
want
to
interview,
what
do
the
candidates...
what
do
these
two
leading
candidates
think
about
this
national
issue
that's
just
suddenly
hit
the
headlines?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
certainly
would
run
to
the
station
just
for
that
very
reason.
they'd
want
people
to
look
at
them
and
hear
what
they
have
to
say
about
this,
because
they
want
to
get
votes.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
the
purpose
here
was
not
just
a
wide-open
debate,
as
i
understand
it.
it
was
a
very
structured
thing.
the
candidate...
each
candidate
wasn't
given
just
15
minutes
to
do
what
you
want
to,
but
the
questions
asked
by
reporters,
the
time
for
opening
was
limited,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
but
one
of
the
problems
in
applying
that
kind
of
forum
analysis
here
is
this.
if
we're
dealing
with...
take
the
easy
example,
the
traditional
public
forum,
the
street
corner
where
the
soap
boxes
are,
basically
it's
a
matter
of
no
concern
whatever
to
the
process
whether
one
person
shows
up
with
a
soap
box
or
200
show
up
with
a
soap
box
and
just
sort
of
shout
at
each
other
in
a
cacophony,
but
that
does
legitimately
matter
if
we're
talking
about
a
tv
debate,
and
i
guess
i
have
two
questions.
number
1
is,
is
it...
are
you
going
to
take
the
position,
to
be
consistent,
that
there
can
be
no
limitation
on
the
number
of
candidates,
and
if
the
answer
to
that
is
no,
then
what
is
your
criterion
for
selection?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
about
a
state
where
the
write-in
procedure
is
very
simple,
and
someone
who
is
perhaps
defeated
in
a
primary
is
going
to
run
as
a
write-in,
and
his
name
is
willy
wacko,
and
he's
regarded
as
a
total
loser
by
all
political
observers.
do
they
have
to
give
him
access?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
want
something
more
than--
--you're
saying
that
the
same
standard
applies
when
you're
talking
about
ballots,
state
regulation
of
ballots,
as
applies
in
this
situation
where
you're
talking
about
a
state-operated--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
shackelford,
with
respect,
you
want
something
more
than
objectivity.
it
would
be
quite
objective
to
say
the
two
parties
that
got
the
most
votes
in
the
last
election
will
be
the
candidates
that
we'll
interview.
will
that
satisfy
you?
unknown
speaker
ah,
but
it's
only
the
latter
that
we're
talking
about
here.
i
mean,
let--
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
fine,
but
what
do
you
want
besides
objectivity?
it's
not
objectivity
alone.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
arguing
for
a
standard.
you
want
us
to
police
these
things
and
determine
who
has
a
modicum
of
support.
that's
your
test.
unknown
speaker
in
buckley
v.
valeo
the
court
upheld
part
of
the
act
of
congress
that
gave
special
benefits
to
the
republican
and
democratic
parties
and
not
to
anybody
else.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--well,
but
they--
--well,
what
if
the
station
had
said
in
advance,
we're
going
to
have
a
debate,
we're
not
including
all
candidates,
we're
going
to
limit
it
to
the
selected
candidates
of
the
republican
and
the
democratic
parties,
and
this
is
spelled
out
in
advance?
unknown
speaker
like
the
ones
who
qualifies
to
get
public
money
for
campaigns?
that's
going
to
leave
out
some
minority
candidates.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--what
about,
you
know,
you
have
to
be
the
candidate
of
a
party
that
was
one
of
the
first
two
parties
in
the
last
election?
that's
objective.
it
doesn't
name
the
republicans
or
the
democrats,
and
it
would
bump
your
candidate,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
no,
we
don't
care
which
one
it
is.
it
just
has
to
be
one
of
the
first
two
parties
in
the
last
election.
it
could
be
the
bull
moose
party
as
far
as
we're
concerned.
[laughter]
that's
the
problem
with
the
standard.
it
is
difficult
to
form
a
standard.
what
about
following
the
standard
that
congress
and
the
federal
communications
commission
have
adopted
after
thinking
about
this
very
problem
in
trying
to
come
up
with
a
standard
that
would
prevent
unreasonable
tests?
unknown
speaker
well,
all
right.
if
in
fact,
would
that
be
a
possible
standard?
we're
concerned
about
this,
the
way
the
court
would
be
able
to...
is
to
look
to
the
very
standard
that
congress
and
the
fcc
had
developed
in
order
to
deal
with
the
problem
that
is
under...
existed
in
arkansas.
unknown
speaker
no,
obviously
not.
the
constitutional
problem
here
is
to
find
a
standard.
what's
the
objection
to
going
to
congress
and
having
them
define
a
possible
standard
that
as
long
as
it
seemed
within
the
realm
of
reason
would
work
with
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
if,
in
fact,
we
follow
the
congress
and
the
congressional
fcc
standard
in
the
area,
how
does
that
affect
your
model?
unknown
speaker
i'm
not...
what
i'm
driving
at
is,
i
thought
that
congress
perhaps
considered
the
problems
of
the
national
tabloids
having
debates,
and
how
could
we
have
a
debate,
because
if
they
had
to
talk
to
everybody,
no
matter
what,
there
would
be
too
many
people
and
they
couldn't
do
it.
i
thought
they
came
up
with
legislation
designed
to
deal
with
this?
isn't
there
a
law
or
an
fcc
rule
that
deals
with
this
in
the
case
of
national
television
debates?
unknown
speaker
that's
one
of
the
standards.
we
have
a
whole
universe
of
choices,
i
suppose,
based
on
our
interpretation
of
the
constitution.
one
standard
is
editorial
discretion.
another
standard
is
an
elaborate,
case-by-case
jurisprudence
for
us
to
determine
what
public
broadcasting
stations
must
do,
and
it
seems
to
me
the
former
might
be
the
better.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
unfettered.
i
think
that's
unfair
on
your
part.
they've
tried
to
set
out
some
guidelines,
and
i
think
you're
speaking
a
little
too
broadly
when
you
say
it's
unfettered.
unknown
speaker
what
does
the
word
subjective
mean
as
you're
using
it
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
else
would
you
plan
a
broadcast?
unknown
speaker
well,
but,
you
know,
you're
saying
that
the
public
broadcasting
stations
could
do
this,
and
perhaps
they
could,
but
does
the
constitution
require
them
to
do
it
just
to
make
it
easier
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
avoid
combing
through
the
record?
unknown
speaker
well,
okay,
but
if
this
is
like
a
licensing
case
we
get
entirely
apart
from
the
election,
then,
what
about
the
university
of
virginia
planning
a
lecture
series
on
political
philosophy?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
you
once
get
away
from
your
election
context
to
a
license
for
a
speech,
which
is
what
you're
talking
about
now,
that,
too,
is
in
a
much
different
context
than
broadcasting.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
what's
wrong
with
what
the
government
says,
and
there
may
be
a
lot
wrong,
but
they
say
they
may
not
invidiously
discriminate?
now,
that
takes
some
of
the
subjectivity
out
of
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
assume
that
we
think
the
station
is
a
state
actor,
all
right?
let's
make
that
assumption.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
southeastern
promotions
was
more
of
a
procedural
case
than
a
substantive--
unknown
speaker
--but
i
take
it--
--mr.
shackelford,
i
understand
that
you're
not
asking
this
court
to
come
up
with
a
code.
what
you
are
saying,
i
thought,
was
that
there
must
be
a
set
of
rules
in
place,
as
they
are
for
public
financing
of
campaigns,
as
there
are
for
standards
of
who
will
have
access
to
the
town
hall,
but
those
standards
must
be
there
not
for
the
court
to
invent,
but
for
the
court
to
review
for
adequacy
once
they're
put
in
place
by--
unknown
speaker
--okay,
but
if
it
had
defined
public
interest,
or
here,
if
it
had
defined
viability,
or...
i
forget
what
the
alternative
criterion
was
here...
would
any
definition
do
as
long
as
we
know
it
in
advance?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
what's
the
second
step?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
that's
the
question.
what
are
the
constitutional
safeguards
it's
got
to
meet?
what
is
the
substance
of
the
second
step?
unknown
speaker
you
use
ballot
access
and
it
varies
widely
from
state
to
state,
because
in
some
states
it's
very
easy
to
get
on
the
ballot
and
in
other
states
it's
harder
to
get
on
the
ballot.
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
really
saying
that
if
you
have
a
public...
if
you
have
a
ballot
access
law,
that
is
a
good
indication
of
what
an
objective
standard
would
be,
and
if
you
vary
from
that,
you're
not
perhaps
necessarily
treading
into
unconstitutionality,
but
you're
certainly
raising
a
serious
question.
is
that
as
far
as
you
go?
unknown
speaker
--that
is
not
the
reference
that
i
was
thinking
of.
i'm
thinking
of
pages
5
and
6
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief.
i'm
thinking
of
the
probable
problems
that
arise
with
the
private
stations
and
the
equal
opportunity
requirement.
i'm
thinking
of
the
fcc's
effort
to
deal
with
that
identical
problem
in
that
statutory
contest
in
the
private
sector,
and
they've
come
up
with
a
set
of
workable
rules,
i
take
it,
for
the
identical
problem
which
is
described
here
as,
if
you'll
recognize
an
exemption,
i.e.,
for
the
comparable...
only
your
broadcasting
decisions
rest
on
a
reasonably
good
faith
journalistic
effort.
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
what
i
want
to
know
is,
why
wouldn't
that
work?
unknown
speaker
well
obviously
you
won't
even
have
that
fcc
effort
to
deal
with
this
very
problem,
why
is
that
effort
not
constitutional,
moving
it
into
our
constitutional
province?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
the
fact
too
that
the
fcc
isn't
authorize
to
fill
in
blanks
in
the
constitution.
well,
they
have
a
comparable
problem.
they
have
a
statute
which
imposes
the
same
kind
of
obligation
on
a
private
person
as
the
constitution
imposes
on
a
public
person.
to
deal
with
that
problem
they
come
up
with
workable
standards.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
saying
that
if
the
fcc
rules
in
a
public
contest
it's
a
constitutional--
unknown
speaker
--but
i'm
concerned
that
what
you're
asking
in
this
case
is
for
us
to
confine
editorial
discretion
in
a
corporate
broadcasting
station,
and
i
suppose
you'd
be
quite
satisfied,
because
you
could
win
your
case,
if
we
said
that
we
will
confine
that
discretion
when
elections
are
involved.
unknown
speaker
but
i'm
not
sure
if
there
is
a
principled
line
in
our
precedent
that
will
allow
us
to
make
that
conclusion,
or
you
to
make
that
argument.
unknown
speaker
and
yet
in
one
sense
editorial
discretion
is
most
important
when
we
are
involved
with
elections.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
except
that
i
think
at
the
same
time
you
are
agreeing
that
if
the
government
station
decides
instead
of
having
a
debate
simply
to
have
an
interview
by
its
political
news
anchor,
it
can
choose
to
interview
anyone
it
wants
to.
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
but
what's
the
answer
to
my
question?
on
your
theory,
is
that
allowed?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
facts
would
be
significant?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you're
really
saying
is,
the
government
up
to
a
point
sets
its
own
terms.
if
the
government
says,
we're
going
to
bring
people
before
you
so
that
you
can
hear
them,
then
they
are
bound
by
something
like
forum
analysis.
if
they
don't
say
that,
and
they
say,
in
essence,
we're
going
to
bring
people
before
you
whom
we
like,
we
endorse,
it's
not
bound
by
forum
analysis?
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
fair
characterization
of
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
mr.
shackelford,
suppose
the
court
were
to
determine
that
the
standards
that
ms...
whatever,
that
those
were
all
okay
standards,
the
problem
was
that
she
made
them
up,
or
came
up
with
them
after,
and
that
under
those
standards
your
candidate
would
flunk,
so
you're
in
this
at
this
point
for
the
money
because
the
election
is
long
over,
would
you
be
entitled
to
any
relief
if
the
standards
that
she
announced
are
okay,
the
only
problem
with
them
was
that
they
weren't
in
place
when
your
candidate
asked
to
be
part
of
the
debate?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
shackelford.
mr.
marks,
you
have
2
minutes
remaining.
unknown
speaker
how
about
standards
like
for
public
financing?
unknown
speaker
is
editorial
discretion...
can
it
be
subject
to
objective
standards?
unknown
speaker
but
don't
you
think
that
there's
a
guarantee
present
when
you
see
the
list,
and
you
say,
okay,
i
have
to
meet
this
list,
then
when
there
is
no
list,
and
then
after
they
turn
you
down
they
say,
these
are
the
reasons?
