ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
going
to
take
about
30
seconds
and
put
this
in
context.
in
1990,
ralph
forbes
running
for
lieutenant
governor
received
47
percent
of
the
state-wide
vote
in
the
republican
primary.
that
vote
included
carrying
15
of
16
counties
which
comprised
the
third
congressional
district.
so,
2
years
later,
he
ran
for
the
third
congressional
district.
he
obtained
thousands
of
signatures
and
met
the
state's
standard
for
a
candidate's
seriousness
and
qualified
as
one
of
three
candidates
on
the
ballot.
days
later,
an
unelected
government
official
summarily
declared
him
a
frivolous
candidate
and
banned
him
from
its
debate
for
that
very
seat.
the
government
therefore
today
asks
this
court
to
give
it
unfettered
discretion
to
pick
and
choose
amongst
candidates,
and
confer
powerful
government
benefits
on
those
it
chooses,
to
the
detriment
of
their
opponents.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
i
think
it's
completely
inaccurate.
i
understand
the
government's
attempt
to
widen
this
to
all
programs,
but
a
debate,
a
candidate
debate
sponsored
by
the
government
is
a
particularized
and
very
unique
event.
it
has
aspects
which
really
do
not
apply
to
any
other
forum.
for
instance,
number
1,
it
involves
not
just
speech,
but
core
political
speech
that
this
court
has
said
is
the
apex
of
protection
under
the
first
amendment.
secondly--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--second--
[laughter]
--it
involves...
this
is
i
think
one
of
the
most
important.
it
involves
more
than
speech.
in
this
context
a
candidate
debate
involves
the
idea
that
the
government
can...
that
government
can
interpose
itself
in
an
election
process,
possibly
skewing
the
debate
and
possibly
affecting
the
outcome
of
the
election,
and
third,
it
is
made
by
its
very
nature
for
candidates,
it's
intending
to
present
them
to
the
public
without
going
through
the
normal
sieve
of
editorial
control
of
media
or
third
parties.
and
then
lastly,
it
is
a
contest,
and
the
reason
you
will
watch
these
debates
is
because
of
the
face-to-face
synergy
and
dynamics
of
the
debates.
there
are
a
number
of
factors--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--i
don't
think
so.
number
1,
we
would
not
be
talking
about
the
election
process.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
i
think
that's
certainly
different,
because
it
wouldn't
be
the
situation
with
the
candidate
debates,
where
the
purpose
is
actually
for
them
to
present
themselves
to
the
public
and
essentially--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--but
the
purpose
of...
assuming
this
is
a
government
station,
the
purpose
of
the
station
would
be
to
create
a
debate
where
candidates
are
presenting
themselves
and
trying
to
influence
the
voters'
viewpoint.
the
purpose
of
the
government
station
in
that
limited
part
of
the
program
would
simply
be--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--yes,
but
for
instance
the
candidates
were
given
an
open
microphone
at
the
beginning
and
the
end
to
express
their
views.
after
each
question,
they
were
given
full
rein
to
answer
those
questions.
there
was
no
editing
of
the
words
as
they
came
out
of
their
mouths
by
the
government.
this
was
really
not
just
a
forum,
it
was
actually
part
of
the
definition
that
this
court's
given
for
what
a
forum
is.
in
cornelius
and
perry
and
a
number
of
cases,
this
court
in
describing
what
a
forum
is,
has
said
it's
public
property,
open
quote,
for
assembly
or
debate.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
we
have
not
taken
that
position.
the
position
we
have
taken
is
that
the
government
cannot
subjectively
pick
and
choose
amongst
the
candidates.
we
agree
that
objective
and
constitutional
criteria,
such
as
the
ballot
access
laws,
are
appropriate,
and
therefore
we're
not
saying
that
no
standards
would
be
allowed.
they
could
even,
for
instance,
simply
draw
the
names
out
of
a
hat.
for
that
at
least
would
be
government
neutrality.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
no,
your...
mr.
chief
justice,
i
don't
think
they
do.
again,
you
have
an
objective
standard,
set
in
place
beforehand,
a
ballot
access
law.
that's
perfectly
allowed,
but
this
court's
ballot
access
decisions,
what
the
court
has
said
is,
it's
okay
to
ensure
a
modicum
of
support.
however,
the
court
has
never
said
that
the
government
can
subjectively
pick
and
choose--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--certainly
the
dangers
are
very
similar,
in
that
we
have
government,
if
they're
allowed
to
subjectively
interpose
themselves
into
the
election
process,
whether
it's
affecting
the
debate
and
what
personal
issues
can
be
discussed
by
the
candidates,
or
whether
it
is
affecting,
you
know,
the
ballot,
it
has
serious
consequences.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
your
honor,
there
has
to
be
two
criterias.
there
has
to
be
first
objectivity
and
the
second
has
to
be
constitutional.
now,
if--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--i
think
they're
both
a
part
of
the
constitution,
number
1,
is
the
analysis
issue,
if
it's
subjective
unfettered
discretion,
that
is
unconstitutional.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
i...
certainly
the
standard
laid
out,
again,
because
we're
dealing
with
sort
of
a
hybrid
first
amendment
as
well
as
election
issues.
what
this
court
has
set
out
saying...
under
the
ballot
access
cases
saying
that
a
modicum
of
support
is
all
right,
but
what
you
can't
do
is
simply
pick
a
particular
party
and
attempt,
as
the
government,
to
entrench
those
parties
and
throw
out--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--well,
the
ballot
access...
the
ballot
access--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--mr.
chief
justice,
you're
correct,
but
they
did
so
not
on
a
subjective
basis,
on
the
basis
of
objective
standards
laid
out
ahead
of
time
with
regard
to
candidates.
certainly
they
weren't--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--certainly
they
weren't
allowing
government
officials
to
simply
look
and
say
we'll
give
this
party
this--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--then
i
think
that
you
have
a
problem
under
williams
v.
rhodes
and
others,
where
the
government
can't
pick
particular
parties.
they
can
use
objective
criteria
that
might
favor
individual
parties--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--right.
in
this
case,
for
instance,
if
an
objective
standard
was
used
like
how
many
votes
you
got
for
the
past
elections,
mr.
forbes
would
qualify.
one
of
his
opponents
wouldn't
but
mr.
forbes
would
have,
but
instead
of
giving
him
an
objective
standard
he
can
meet,
the
only
objective
standard
that
was
there,
he
did
meet.
they
simply
won't
wish
that--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--that's
why
they
ask
the
court
today
for
unfettered
discretion
to
simply
pick
and
choose.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
i
think
this
court's
ballot
access
cases
invoke
the
theory
that
guarantees
the
parties
some
sort
of--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--well,
the
standard
that
the
government
has
actually
chosen
under
the
fec
is
actually
that
of
preestablished
subjective
criteria.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
well,
obviously
we
don't
think
that
the
constitution
is
somehow
overridden
by
the
fcc--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--well,
i
think
the
court
contemplates
whatever
it
wishes
to
come
out
with
its
standard,
whatever
it
determines
or
interprets
to
be
necessary
to
be
constitutional--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--well,
if
we're
talking
about
the
fcc,
i
assume
there
is
no
standard.
they...
what
both
government
agencies,
the
federal
and
state
said
today
is
they
think
have
unfettered--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--not
that
i'm
aware
of...
that
deals
with
any
fcc
criteria
of
how
to
pick
their
candidates.
i
think
they
are
seeking
unfettered
editorial
discretion
of
the
stations.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
well,
i
think
that
an
argument
of
editorial
discretion
is
simply
saying
at
their
discretion,
and
we're
saying
whatever
standard
this
court
comes
up
with,
certainly
unfettered
discretion
over
the
type
of
constitutional--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--let
me
explain
what
i
mean,
justice
o'connor.
number
1,
they
conceded
in
their
own
brief,
and
they
certainly
know
this,
that
their
decision
was
a
subjective
one.
number
2--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--it
means
that
they
were
appraising
facts,
using
discretion,
coming
to
conclusions--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--you
could
set
clearly
tangible
criteria
that...
that
where
courts
of
appeals
could
simply
look
and
see
uniform
application
of
a
rule
whether
the
candidate
met
the
criteria
instead
of
having
to
comb
through
the
record--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--no.
i
think
the
constitution
does
require
them
to
do
it
under...
a
number
of...
even
under
its
licensing
cases
the
court
has
said
that
it
cannot
vest
unfettered
discretion
in
a
government
official
over
speech
and
this
is
more
critical--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--well,
obviously
we
have
a
number
of
different
aspects
that--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--we're
talking
about
two
different
things,
i
think,
probably.
number
1,
what
we're
saying
is
in
a
particular
and
unique
forum
of
candidate
debates
standardless
discretion
is
not
allowed
in
government.
but
second,
if
we
go
to
the
forum
analysis,
which
is
what,
mr.
chief
justice,
you
were
referring
to,
under
a
forum
analysis,
again,
as
this
court
has
said,
not
only
is
the
debate
a
forum,
it
is
what
this
court
has
used
to
describe
what
a
forum
is.
the
only
question
therefore
really
is
the
limitations
of
the
forum,
and
i
apologize,
this
is
not
in
the
brief.
i
just
finally
understood
this
last
night.
what
the
government
is
actually
doing
here
is,
they
are
putting
as
their
limit
to
a
limited
forum
a
subjective
determination.
that
allows
them
to
create
a
forum
and
then
later
when
particular
speakers
arise
to
enter
the
forum,
they
use
their
subjective
decisionmaking
to
exclude
them.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
well,
number
1,
i
don't
know
how
they
can
actually
say
that.
aetn
is
working
as
a
state
actor.
if
they're
a
state
actor,
they're
not
bound...
i
mean,
they're
saying
they're
a
private
actor.
if
they're
a
private
actor
they're
not
bound
by
the
constitution,
they
can
engage
in
viewpoint
discrimination,
they
can
endorse
candidates--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--then
if
they're
a
state
actor
what
we
have
is
a
case
that
almost
exactly
fits
this
court's
case
in
southeastern
productions
in
which
chattanooga
created
a
forum
of
a
theatre.
in
this
case,
they
created...
the
government
created
a
forum
for
the
debate.
then,
the
speakers
were
placed
in
that
theatre.
in
this
case
there
was...
it
was
candidates
in
this
debate.
then
what
happened
is,
when
hair
was
drawn
in,
they
said,
well,
our
forum
is
limited,
however.
it's
limited
to
plays
which
are
in
the
best
interests
of
the
community.
in
this
case,
in
the
reply
brief,
the
petitioner
says
our
standard
was,
was
it
in
the
best
interest
of
the
community?
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
it's
just
a
forum
analysis,
and
what
they
do
is,
once
you
realize
you're
in
a
real
forum,
which
you
are
here,
the
government
cannot
come
up
with
this
type
of
discretionless
standard
that
at
best,
again,
unfettered
discretion
of
government
officials,
subjective...
what
they
say
is
subjective
determination.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
that's
what
we're
saying.
at
the
very
first
level
we
know
that
the
government
cannot
engage
in
a
subjective
determination,
picking
and
choosing
amongst
the
candidates--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--no.
i
think
it
was
a
twostep
analysis.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
the
first
step
is
objective
criteria,
and
the
second
step
is
it
has
to
meet
the
constitutional
safeguards--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--i
think
with
the
ballot
access.
it's
probably
the
closest
thing
that
we
have
that
deals
with
the
election
process,
and
the
standards
that
i
see
in
there
are
not
necessarily
bright
lines
the
court
has
said,
but
it's
okay
to
require
a
modicum
of
support.
it's
not
okay
to
simply
entrench
the
major
parties
and
throw
out
the
minority.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
i
think
the
interesting
thing
about
ballot
access
is
it's
respectful
of
the
people's
wishes.
they
have
put
forward
in
their
legislature
this
is
what
we
consider
a
serious
candidate,
and
to
allow
another
government
agency
in
that
state
to
say,
we
don't
care
what
you
think
is
a
serious
candidate,
we're
going
to
exclude
your
candidate
from
the
debate
and
confer
powerful
government
benefits
to
his
opponents--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--certainly
ballot
access
would
be
sufficient,
and
in
fact
that
was
the
only
objective
standard
laid
out
in
this
case,
and
mr.
forbes
met
it.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
your
honor--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--number
1,
the
fcc
standards
are
there
in
private
and
public
broadcasting,
so
it
wouldn't
be
something...
it
wouldn't
be--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--number
1,
because
the
idea
that
an
individual
can
exercise
their
first
amendment
rights
in
a
different
place
at
a
different
time
has
never
been
held
as
a
sufficient
basis
for
denying
their
rights
and
ignoring
the
law.
for
instance,
that
argument,
if
it
were
used
in
brown
versus
board
of
education,
would
tell
african-american
parents
they
can
go
to
a
private
school.
in
this
case,
the
forum
was
a
debate.
the
speaker
cannot
be
excluded
on
the
basis
that
they
could
speak
at
some
other
time,
some
other
place.
it's
certainly
not
sufficient
under
the
constitution.
southeastern
productions
says
this--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--they
might
be
workable,
but
we
say
they're
certainly
not
constitutional--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--right.
certainly
what
they
have
here
is
not
sufficient
for
government
broadcasting.
the
fcc
has
made
clear
its
approach
is
to
give
unfettered
discretion
to
all
of
its
broadcasters,
and
so
essentially
what
we
have
in
the
question
is...
and
i
think
the
context
we
have
is,
a
broadcasting
industry
is
a
government
monopoly
which
is
run
by
the
fcc.
two-thirds
of
the
licenses
given
out
are
given
out
to
government
licensees.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
i
think--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--i
think
there
is,
in
that
there
are
aspects
in
this
particularized
forum
that
do
not
exist
in
any
other
forum,
and
therefore
it
has
to
extrapolate
from
this
type
of
forum
to
a
forum
that
does
involve
elections,
that
does
involve
candidates.
we
would
be
in
a
completely
different
analysis...
it
may
involve
speech
elements,
but
it
wouldn't
involve
other
voter's
rights
elements.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
well,
certainly
not
in
government
editorial
discretion,
in
the
way
it
interposes
itself
into
the
election
process,
possibly
skews
the
debates.
for
instance,
excluding
minority
candidates
has
more
than
one
effect.
maybe
that
minority
candidate
is
going
to
be
our
congressman
in
2
months.
maybe
they're
going
to
change
the
election
as
well
for
some
of
the
other
candidates,
or
i
think
the
most
important,
maybe
the
ideas
they
express
are
going
to
be
the
ones
around
which
the
entire
campaign
is
focused.
so
if
we
allow
this
type
of
discretion
in
excluding
minority
candidates,
it
will
be
a
direct
attack
on
the
whole
idea
of--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--it's
certainly
a
far
step
away
from
our
case.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
facts.
if
what
we
have--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--i
think
number
1,
whether
there's
a
case
for
a
face-to-face
candidate
discussion
going
on,
that
will
bring
out
that
answer--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--well,
i
don't
know
whether
bound
by--
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
--what
i'm
saying
is,
there's
a
line,
and
i
don't
know
that
i
can
draw
the
line
exactly
between
when
it
leaves
government
speech
and
becomes
a
nonpublic
forum.
i
think
when
they
begin
to
involve
private
speakers,
that
is
the
first
time
the
first
amendment
might
begin
to
come
into
play,
but
certainly
when
they
get
as
far
across
the
line
as
they
are
in
the
current
case,
with
a
candidate-government
debate,
it
is
very
clearly
a
limited
public
forum,
and
i
don't
think
there
will
be
any
question
about
that.
ms.
kelly
j.
shackelford
i
think
we
would
still
be
entitled
to
relief.
because,
a
good
example
was
the
southeastern
productions
case.
in
that
case,
the
play
had
already
been
declared
obscene
in
a
criminal
action,
and
so,
but
then
the
court
didn't
even
get
to
that
issue.
what
they
said
was,
use
of
unfettered
discretion
itself
is
enough
of
a
constitutional
violation.
