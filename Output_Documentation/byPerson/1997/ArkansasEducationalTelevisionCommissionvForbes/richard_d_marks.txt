mr.
richard
d.
marks
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
state
of
arkansas
may
establish
the
arkansas
educational
television
network
as
an
institution
of
the
press,
insulated
by
policy,
structure,
and
tradition
from
state
political
pressure.
the
issue
is
important
to
viewers
across
the
country
who
depend
on
public
television
to
select
and
deliver
information,
particularly
so
in
political
elections
but,
of
course,
at
other
times,
too,
and
this
case
does
not
extend
just
to
political
debates,
because
if
the
decision
below
stands,
its
rationale
will
not
only
result
in
fewer
debates
and
less
coverage
of
politics,
but
it
will
extend
to
other
programs
of
a
controversial
nature
where
the
trustworthiness
of
public
television
editors
will
be
questioned
because
they
are
employees
of
the
state.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
your
honor,
i
agree
that
the
rationale
that
the
court
uses
will,
of
course,
affect
the
scope
of
the
decision,
but
i
think
that
it's
clear
from
the
record
whether
we
deal
with
a
public
forum
doctrine
rationale
or
whether
we
deal
with
a
structural
rationale
based
on
league
of
women
voters.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
this
case
we
are
not
talking
about
state
speech.
we
are--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--your
honor,
the
rules--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--not
exactly,
your
honor.
in
fact,
i
think
that
that
is
not
a
full
enough
characterization
of
the
record.
what
the
state
decided
here
was
to
hold
a
debate
that
would
best
serve
the
interests
of
its
viewers,
and
the
record
reflects
that
the
editors
went
through
an
elaborate
analysis.
ms.
oliver
did
an
elaborate
investigation
and
reported
to
ms.
howarth,
the
editor-in-chief
of
the
arkansas
network,
about
those
candidates
who
were
newsworthy,
and
it
is--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--no,
your
honor.
in
fact,
when
the
debate
discussion
started,
which
was
sometime
in
the
spring
of
1992,
there
was
a
discussion,
and
it's
reflected
in
the
testimony
that
we
had
at
trial,
about
how
the
debates
would
be
structured
and
about
their
rationale,
and
the
purpose
from
the
beginning
was
to
provide
the
citizens
of
arkansas
with
a...
an
opportunity
to
hear
the
views
of
those
candidates
who
were
going
to
be
the
ones
they
were
going
to
be
voting
for,
who
had,
in
the
words
of
the
witnesses,
a
serious
chance,
who
were
demonstrating
popular
support
by
virtue
of
any
number
of
factors.
now,
certainly--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--not
in
all
its--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--complexity,
no,
your
honor,
but
what...
but
the
early
discussions
between
amy
oliver
and
bill
simmons,
the
chief
of
the
associated
press
in
arkansas,
concentrated
on
whom
to
invite.
now,
when
they
issued
the
invitations
the
only
candidates
who
were
on
the
list
to
be
invited
were
ballot-qualified
candidates,
and
they
were
in
each
district
the
republican
and
the
democratic
candidates,
so
when
the
original
decision
was
made,
the
only
candidates
who
could
be
invited
were
the
major
party
candidates.
mr.
forbes
qualified
on
august
17
of
1992,
and
his
letter
was
august
24,
but
even
before
that,
your
honor,
the
policies
that
aetn
has
adopted,
the
policy
on
editorial
integrity,
the
programming
policy
which
incorporates
the
principles
of
editorial
integrity,
set
out
for
ms.
howarth
what
would
be
her
basis
for
decision.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
are
enough
cases...
the
chisolm
case,
the
henry
geller
decision
at
the
fcc...
so
that
in
fact
from
those
cases
the
court
can
take
judicial
notice
that
this
is
a
typical
structure
for
debates.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
no,
your
honor,
because
of
section
399
of
the
communications
act.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
well,
your
honor,
of
course
that
is
very
much
not
this
case,
and
i
think
under--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--not
without
399,
your
honor,
because
the--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--under
forum
doctrine
the
answer
is
no,
because
i
think
to
do
that--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--a
private
broadcaster
can.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
i
think
this
public
broadcaster
under
these
policies,
the
principles
of
editorial
integrity
and
aetn's
programming
policy,
this
public
broadcaster
could
not
do
that
and
stay
within
the
bounds
of
the
policy--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
the
answer
to
justice
scalia's
question
would
depend
on
whether
that
would
be
considered
invidious
discrimination,
and
i
don't
think
there's
any
precedent
on
it,
but
my
belief
is
that
it
would
be.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
sure,
under
an
equal
protection
theory.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
could
not.
could
not,
because
i
think
that
the...
i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
there
are
limits
on
what
a
state-owned
broadcaster
can
do.
i
think
those
bounds
are
set
by
invidious
discrimination--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--i
think,
your
honor,
that
there's
a
great
difference
between
endorsing
a
candidate
and
having
the
state
come
down
that
way.
i
think
it's
an
equal
protection
issue
at
the
very
least.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
the
answer
to
the
second
question
is
yes,
and
the
answer
to
the
first
question
is
yes.
each
one
of
these
situations,
each
one
of
these
questions
about
whether
a
particular
program
satisfies
this
court's
precedent,
is
a
two-level
analysis.
first
you've
got
to
analyze
the
intent
of
aetc
in
delegating
to
ms.
howarth
the
editorial
discretion
within
the
bounds
of
these
policies,
and
justice
scalia,
these
policies
do
bound
her
in
a
way
that
a
private
broadcaster
is
not
bound,
because
they
require
her
to
consider
credibility
and
fairness
and
balance
and
accuracy
and
objectivity,
and
a
private
broadcaster
is
not
bound
that
way.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
i
think
most
broadcasters
would
find
them
desirable
and,
indeed,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
intent
of
adopting
the
principles
of
editorial
integrity
was
to
allow
the
public
broadcaster
to
walk
this
very
difficult
line
of
needing
to
satisfy
the
requirements
of
the
first
amendment
as
the
foundation
requirement,
but
at
the
same
time
being
able
to
satisfy
the
requirement
in
the
communications
act
that
it
control
all
its
programming,
because
they're--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--well,
your
honor,
in
this
case...
i
understand
that
the
question
is
a,
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
a
polar
question
for
analytical
purposes,
but
this
case
has
a
record,
and
there
are
distinct
policies
here,
and
there
is
elaborate
testimony--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--with--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--with
section
399
not
there,
your
honor?
mr.
richard
d.
marks
with
the
prohibition
not
there?
i
still
believe
that
there's
an
equal
protection
boundary
for
a
state-owned
broadcaster
in
that
area.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
well,
i
think
that
is
viewpoint
discrimination,
as
i
understand
your
question,
that's
certainly
prohibited
under
the
rationale
of
the
forum
doctrine
cases,
because--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--because
in--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--the
guiding
principles
are
certainly
in
writing,
and
there
are
two
levels,
the
guidelines--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--that's
right,
your
honor.
what
ms.
howarth
is
obligated
to
do
is
to
apply
the
principles
of
mainstream
journalism
and,
under
those
principles,
she
made
a
decision
based
on
newsworthiness.
now,
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--there
are
two
reasons,
justice
souter.
first,
as
mr.
perot's
experiences
in
1992
and
1996
illustrate,
there
can
be
a
different
conclusion
based
on
newsworthiness,
and
the
distinctly
minority
candidate
does
not
always
lose.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
yes,
your
honor,
and
the
reason,
as
reflected
in
the
record
in
the
testimony
of
ms.
howarth
and
ms.
oliver,
is
that
a
major
party
nomination
carries
with
it
a
degree
of
public
support
that
news
people
usually
don't
ignore,
and
they
didn't
ignore
in
this
case.
they
felt
it
was--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--not
in
a
nonpublic
forum,
your
honor,
and
certainly
not
under
a
league
of
women
voters
structural
analysis.
if
you...
i
don't
think
that
we
require
that...
i
don't
think
this
court's
cases
require--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--let's...
let
me
address
that
in
terms
of
polk
county.
there's
no
question
that
there's
state
action
here,
but
ms.
howarth
is
not
acting,
in
our
view,
as
we
have
said
in
our
brief,
under
color
of
state
law.
she
is
exercising
independent
professional
judgment.
this
is
essentially
a
private
press
function.
she's
not
dependent
on
the
state's
coercive
power
here.
she's
not
doing
this
out
of
loyalty
to
the
state.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
no,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
if
she
crossed...
first
of
all,
that
would
be
outside
these
policies
that
guide
her,
and
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
and
justice
ginsburg's
question,
theses
policies
do
provide
some
guidance.
it's
not
as
if
the...
not
as
if
she's
out
there
on
a
chartless
sea.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
and
if
that's
the
case,
your
honor,
just
on
pure
forum
doctrine
terms,
when
you're
dealing,
justice
ginsburg,
with
a
nonpublic
forum,
then
the
rules
there
need
not
be--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
you
do,
but
i
think
as
you
phrased
it
the
key
word
is
selected
candidates,
because
the
intent
of
ms.
howarth
from
the
start
was
clear
that
she
was
not
opening
up
this
debate
to
candidates
who
were
not
newsworthy.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
i
think
that
in--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--well,
i'm...
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--we
determine
it
based
on
cornelius,
which
set
the
starting
point--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--i
think
what
we
need
to
do
is
look
at
ms.
howarth's
intent,
and
i
think
we
need
to
look
also
at
the
equity
aetc's
intent
in
establishing
a
network
to
control
all
of
its
programming
and
exercise
editorial
judgment
over
all
of
its
programming.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
i
can
do
that.
can
you
hear
me
now?
mr.
richard
d.
marks
justice
o'connor,
the
answer
to
the
cornelius
question
is,
what
was
ms.
howart's
intent?
what
was
the
aetn's
intent?
the
intent
is
key
in
both
the
structural
analysis
of
the
reading
of
the
league
of
women
voters,
and
on
the--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--that's
exactly
correct,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
the
key
is
whether
ms.
howarth
intended
to
open
up
the
debate
only
to
newsworthy
candidates,
or
whether
she
intended
to
allow
the
debate
to
be
open
on
a
nonselective
basis
to
anybody
who
was
ballot-qualified.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
ms.
howarth's
contention
is
that
it
is
a
nonpublic
forum
because
it
was
ms.
howarth's
intention
in
providing
for
participation
she
was
not
opening
it
up
to
all
ballot
qualified
candidates,
but
only
to
those
candidates
that
were
newsworthy,
and
mr.
forbes
was
not
newsworthy.
he
was
an
ineffective
candidate.
his
efforts
to
fit
a
place
in
the
market
space
were
feeble,
he
was
not
generating
public
support,
and
for
that
reason
ms.
howarth
concluded
that
his
appearance
would
not
serve
her
audience,
and
for
that
reason
it
was
her
position
that
he
did
not
fit
the
criteria
to
be
included.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--your
honor,
you
will
find
a
discussion
of
the
debate
in
the
motion
for
summary
judgment
that
was
filed.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
in
mr.
simmons
affidavit--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--it
was
an
hour,
actually
it
was
53
minutes
time
for
the
candidates.
the
candidates
began
with
a
2
minute
opening
statement
and
concluded
with
a
closing
statement,
and
between
that
each
candidate
had
a
minute
to
answer
each
question
posed
by
the
panel
of
journalists,
and
then
ms.
howarth
testified
that
there
were
opening
and
closing
credits
and
other
material.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
they
were
selected
from
associated
press
groups
of
editors
and
reporters
who
asked
their
own
questions.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
ballot
qualification
is,
is
an
arbitrary
standard.
it's
both
over-and
under-inclusive,
and
it
simply
wouldn't
work.
that's
why
editorial
judgment
is
an
essential
element
in
this
enterprise.
you
can't
run
a
news
organization
without
engaging
in
editorial
discretion.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
i
think,
your
honor,
that
the
public
financing
standards
that
the
fc,
the
fec,
federal
elections
commission
has
asked
for,
even
though
their
objectives
are--
mr.
richard
d.
marks
--no,
your
honor,
it
can't.
it
has
to...
the
problem,
justice
ginsburg
with
your...
with
relying
on
federal
election
commission
standards,
because
any
time
there's
a
list
of
standards,
there's
going
to
be
a
weighing
and
balancing,
and
it
will
be
subject
to
some
subjectivity
in
that
mix.
mr.
richard
d.
marks
no,
your
honor,
i
don't.
this
is
not
an
algorithm,
and
using
the
newsworthiness
standard
there's
always
an
opportunity,
if
somebody
doesn't
want
to
use
the
newsworthiness
standard,
wants
to
discriminate,
there's
always
opportunity
to
manipulate
those
factors.
in
fact,
in
answer
to
justice
breyer's
question
about
the
fcc's
standards
that
have
been
quoted
here,
because
those
standards
in
fact
in
the
second
prong
of
the
test
for
an
exemption
forbid
viewpoint
discrimination.
