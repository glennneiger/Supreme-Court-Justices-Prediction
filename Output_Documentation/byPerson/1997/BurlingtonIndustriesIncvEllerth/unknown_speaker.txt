unknown
speaker
mr.
casey.
unknown
speaker
it
sounds
to
me
like
you're
asking
question
2
of
the
questions
presented
on
petition
for
certiorari,
which
is
whether
strict
liability
is
the
proper
standard.
now,
i
thought
the
court
didn't
grant
certiorari
on
question
2.
i
thought
we
granted
certiorari
on
question
1.
unknown
speaker
most
of
your
brief
addresses
question
2.
i
mean,
are
we
going
to
talk
about
question
1,
on
which
cert
was
granted?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
doesn't
address
strict
liability
actually.
it
says
whether
a
claim
of
quid
pro
quo
sexual
harassment
may
be
stated
under
title
vii,
when
the
plaintiff
has
neither
submitted
to
the
sexual
advances
nor
suffered
any
tangible
effects.
that's
the
question.
unknown
speaker
it...
it
doesn't
refer
to
strict
liability.
unknown
speaker
well,
there...
there's
really
no
other
reason
to
have
the
quid
pro
quo
category,
is
there?
unknown
speaker
except
to
establish
a
different
standard
of
liability.
unknown
speaker
the
statute
doesn't...
doesn't
establish
different
kinds
of
sexual
harassment...
quid
pro
quo
and...
and
environmental
harassment.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
in
the
statute,
is
it?
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
vii,
you
are
just
asserting
that
there
is
a
different
standard
for
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
so
everybody
agrees
that
this
kind
of
claim
is
stated
under
title
vii?
unknown
speaker
and
then
how
did
we
come
to
this
distinction,
then?
because
the
statute
doesn't
say
a
word
about
quid
pro
quo
and
it
doesn't
say
a
word
about
hostile
environment.
it
says:
same
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
period.
unknown
speaker
do
we
have
a
race
or
national
origin
case
where
there's
a
negligence,
as
opposed
to
vicarious
liability?
unknown
speaker
so
suppose
this
supervisor...
let's
use
race
as
an
example...
suppose
a
supervisor
says,
i'm
not
going
to
promote
you
because
you're
asian,
hispanic,
whatever,
and
a
week
later
does
promote
the
person.
and
the
person
is
no
longer
even
working
for
that
supervisor...
promoted
out
of
the
department.
is
there
a
violation
there?
unknown
speaker
there
is?
unknown
speaker
there
is
not.
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
analogize
what
happened
here
to
the
hypothetical
that
i...
i
gave
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
in
the
case
that
i...
that
i
put
the
promotion...
the
case
where
i
put
it
was...
that
she
was
promoted
the
next
week.
unknown
speaker
suppose
in
the
race
hypothetical
the
promotion
isn't
going
to
come
up
for
a
year,
but
the
supervisor
has
said
that.
could
the
employee
bring
a
cause
of
action
injunction?
or
is
there
just
no...
it's
just
kind
of
a
violation
in
the
air,
with
no
damage?
unknown
speaker
despite...
despite
the
insult
and
the
personal
hurt,
et
cetera,
et
cetera?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if...
what
if
you
have
a
situation
of
a
supervisor
for
a
large
corporate
employer
who
routinely
orders
a
female
employee
under
his
supervision
to
go
to
a
certain
isolated
place,
where
the
supervisor
can
be
alone
with
this
employee
and
repeatedly
then
tries
to
use
that
opportunity
for
sexual
gratification...
repeatedly?
no...
no
change
in
promotion
status
or
discharge.
is...
is
there
vicarious
liability
there
for
the
employer
or
only
if
the
employer
is,
as
you
put
it,
negligent?
unknown
speaker
no.
i...
i
left
that
out
of
the
assumption.
unknown
speaker
that
the
supervisor
uses
his
supervisor...
supervisory
authority
to
place
the
employee
in...
in
this
situation,
where
he
can
then
take
advantage
of
her.
unknown
speaker
and
does
so
repeatedly.
unknown
speaker
but
the
employer
is
not
negligent,
the
employer
tells
all
their
supervisors
to
be
careful,
don't
do
this.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
then
why
not,
in...
in
one
instance
alone...
let...
let's
take
justice
o'connor's
example,
but
change
it
in
this
respect.
let's
assume
the
supervisor
orders
the...
the
employee
into
his
office.
and
instead
of
being
subtle
about
it
or
comparatively
so,
he
is
very
explicit
about
it.
he
said:
you
are
going
nowhere
with
this
company.
you
are
not
going
to
get
your
promotion
12
months
hence
unless
in
the
meantime
you
grant
sexual
favors
to
me.
isn't
that
sufficient
to
create
at
least
the
hostile
environment?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
what
could
be
more
hostile
than
that?
unknown
speaker
oh,
quite.
but...
but
the...
the
point
of
the
single
incident
cases,
as
i
understand
them,
is
that
there's
a
certain
amount
of...
of
necessary
rough
give
and
take
in
life.
and
the
fact
that
there
may
be
one
or
two
employees
in
a
company
who
occasionally
make
a
remark...
the
one-incident
case
to
be
literal
about
it...
does
not
suffice
to
modify
the
entire
environment
to
the
point
where
a
discrimination
can
be
inferred.
but
when
one
is
talking
about
a
supervisor,
with
the
undoubted
authority,
in
effect,
to...
to
change
the
entire
future
of
a
given
employee
in
that
company,
and
that
supervisor
is
explicit
about
it,
nothing
is
left
to
chance,
it
seems
to
me
that
the...
that
the...
the
very
power
of
the
employer,
the
explicitness
of
what
he
does
in...
in
this
hypothetical
should...
should
be
enough,
whereas
one
remark
from
a
fellow
employee
wouldn't
be
enough.
unknown
speaker
but
why...
why
not?
why,
if...
if
in
a
series
of
cases
the
employer
is
going
to
be
liable
because
the
supervisor
has
been
authorized,
has
been
given
a
particular
power
and
repeatedly
abuses
it,
so
that
the
abuse
is
clear,
why
shouldn't
the
employer,
by
a
parity
of
reasoning,
be
liable
when
the
abuse
is
equally
clear
when
it
is
made
very
explicitly
clear
in...
in
one
instance?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he
has
done
nothing
in
justice
o'connor's
hypo
except
speak
words,
except
that
he
has
done
so
somewhat
less
explicitly
than
he
does
in
my
case.
so
it
may
take
a
while
to
make
it
very
clear
that
he
means
what
he
says.
but
in...
in
my
case,
the...
the
same
inference
can
be
drawn
after
the
first
instance.
unknown
speaker
but
she
resisted.
she
resisted
every
time.
it
was
awful
for
her,
but
she
resisted.
what...
where
do
you
put
that
case?
i
assume
that
if
she
succumbs
in
order
to
get
the
promotion,
then
you
would
say
we
don't
have
to
prove
negligence;
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now
she
reasonably...
she
reasonably
believes
that
it's
going
to
be
very
hard
to
put
up
resistance,
but
she's
going
to
do
it.
she
reasonably
believes
that
she's
got
to
resist
this.
and
she
does.
and
in
those
two
cases,
as
far
as
the
employer
is
concerned,
there's
no
more
likelihood
that
the
employer
will
know
about
one
situation
than
the
other,
is
there?
but
you
told
me
that
if
she
succumbs,
then
there's
liability.
and
if
she
doesn't,
then
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's...
that
would
all
be
for
a
trial
if
there
were
a
trial.
but
this...
that's...
this
was
decided
only
on
summary
judgment.
unknown
speaker
so
we
don't
know
anything
about
what
employees...
we
know
that
there
was
a
policy.
we
don't
know
anything
about
how
effective
it
was,
how
other
employees
reacted
to
it.
so
all
we
know
at
this
stage
in
the
game
is
that
there
was
a
policy.
unknown
speaker
we...
we
know...
we
know
two
things:
that
there
was
a
policy
and
she
didn't
use
it.
we
don't
know
any...
anything
about
why.
it
may
be
that
she
thought
it
would...
was
a
totally
ineffective
policy.
but
we
really
can't
go
beyond
the
summary
judgment
record.
and
we
don't
know
any
of
these
things,
other
than
the
fact
that
there
was
a
policy
and
the
fact
that
she
didn't
use
it.
unknown
speaker
where
is
that?
what
are
you
referring
to?
what
testimony?
unknown
speaker
what...
what
is
the
relationship
between
your
reasonably
believe
standard
and
the
standard
either
of
employer
negligence
or,
for
that
matter,
employer
strict
liability?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
understood
you
to
say
a
moment
ago,
in
response
to
justice
ginsburg's
variant
on
the
question,
that
if
the
employee
reasonably
believed
that
he
could
carry
out...
that
the
employer
could
carry
out
threats,
even
though
those
threats
had
not
at
that
point
been
carried
out,
that
there
would
be
a
hostile
environment.
and
i...
i
was
going
to
say,
what
is
the
relationship
between
that
standard
and
the
standard
of
employer
negligence?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
if
she
reasonably
believed
it
and
did
not
submit,
even
on
a
claim
of
hostile
work
environment,
there
would
be
no
liability,
period?
there
could
be
no
liability;
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
a
question
on
that
point?
supposing
in
the
chicago
office
you
had
conditions
that
clearly
amounted
to
a
hostile
work
environment,
much...
much
worse
facts
than
you
have
here.
everybody
is
being
very,
very
rude
to
the
female
employees.
and
the
only
person
outside
of
that
office
who
knows
about
it
is
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
sales
in
new
york...
this
particular
individual.
would
that
be
notice
to
the
company
of
the
hostile
work
environment?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it's
open
only
in
chicago.
and
the
only
higher
executive
who
knows
about
it
is
this
particular
individual,
mr.
slowik.
would
that
be
sufficient
notice
to
the
company?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
had
exactly
the
duties
he
has
in
this
case.
he's
the
vice
president
in
charge
of
the
sales
in
a
large
part
of
the
country.
is
that--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
he's
aware
of
it.
that's
my--
unknown
speaker
--well,
then
why
isn't
it
notice
to
the
company
when
he
does
it
himself?
unknown
speaker
what
if
he
told
the
president
about...
about
the
case,
the
president
of
the
company.
would
she
then
have...
have
a
case?
he
told
the
president
everything
that
she's
put
in
the
record
here.
unknown
speaker
the
question...
part
of
the
question
is,
a,
is
there
a
violation?
and,
b,
if
so,
is
the
company
responsible
for
it?
and
i'm
trying
to
assume
that...
that
what
he
said
would
be
a
violation.
maybe
that's
where
we...
we
part
company.
i
don't
know.
but
if
the
things
that
happened
here
were
not
only
known
by
mr.
slowik,
but
by
the
board
of
directors
of
the
company,
would
there
be
liability?
unknown
speaker
so...
so
it
isn't
a
question
of
whether
we
hold
the
company
responsible.
the
question,
in
your
view,
is
whether
there
was
a
violation
at
all?
unknown
speaker
right.
i
thought
you
said
earlier
that...
that,
in
your
view,
the
acts
were
not
repeated
enough
to
constitute
a
hostile
work
environment.
was
i
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
so
that's
the
reason,
if
there
were
notice
to
the
company--
unknown
speaker
--can...
can
i
ask
you
something
about
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
you
said
that
where...
where
the
company
officer
takes
the
woman
aside
to
an
isolated
place
where
he
can
make
his
sexual
advances,
that
that
would...
that
would
be
automatic
liability
on
the
part
of
the
employer?
unknown
speaker
that
would
be
a
quid
pro
quo
case?
is
that
why...
why...
because
he's
using
his
power
as
an
officer
to
take
her
aside
to
the--
unknown
speaker
--what
would
you
call
that?
would
you
call
that
quid
pro
quo?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
he
tells
her
to
come
over
to
the
water
cooler?
i
mean,
boy,
you've
expanded
quid
pro
quo
an
enormous
amount
if
you
accept
that.
what
if
he
tells
her,
you
know,
come
on
over
to
the
water
cooler,
i
want
to
tell
you
something,
and
she
goes
over
to
the
water
cooler?
unknown
speaker
i
had
thought
the
quid
pro
quo
was
just
those...
those
company
actions
which,
in
themselves,
amount
to
an
alteration
of
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment,
like
firing,
promotion
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
willing
to
say
quid
pro
quo
is...
is
what,
any...
any
action
that...
that
an
officer
of
the
company
has
authority
to
tell
somebody
to
do?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
isn't
constant
isolation,
as
i
understood
her
hypothetical.
he
just
took
her
aside
to
an
isolated
place
to
make
his
proposition.
i
mean
if
he
assigned
her
to
a...
you
know,
to
timbuktu
or
something,
yes,
then--
unknown
speaker
--then
i
could
see
a
quid
pro
quo.
unknown
speaker
but
he
just
pulled
her
aside
to
make
his
proposition.
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
so
she's
working...
you...
you
understood
her
question
to
mean
that
she's
working
in
an
isolated
part
of
the
factory?
unknown
speaker
all
by
herself
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
casey--
--well,
that
wasn't
the
question.
[laughter]
but
you're
altering
it
to
suit
your
needs
now.
mr.
casey,
would
you
explain
this
to
me?
in
the...
i
take
it
it's
common
ground
here
with
you
and
everybody
else
that
in
a
hostile
environment
claim
there
does
not
have
to
be
any
change
in
conditions
beyond
those
conditions
which
are
constituted
by
the
hostility
of
the
environment?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now--
unknown
speaker
--right.
if
the
environmental
hostility
is
created
by
threats
of
personnel
action,
threats
of
a
quid
pro
quo
nature
in
other
words,
which
are
not
carried
out,
why
isn't
the
hostility
of
the
environment
just
as
clear,
even
though
there
are
no
other
changes
in
condition,
as...
as
may
be
the
case
in
a
non-unfulfilled
quid
pro
quo
hostile
environment
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
i'm
leaving
aside
the...
and
maybe...
maybe
i'm
isolating
the
question
too
much
for...
for...
for
your
tastes...
but
i'm...
i'm
suggesting
for
a
minute
let's
leave
aside
the
standard
for
imputing
liability
to
the
employer.
let's
just
look
at
whether
there's
been
a
violation.
and...
and
forget
whether
it's
negligence
or
whether
it's
strict
liability
for
the
moment.
and
i
take
it
your
answer
is
yes,
there
can
be
a
hostile
environment
by
unfulfilled
quid
pro
quo
kinds
of
threats?
unknown
speaker
and
your...
your
only
point
of
difference
then,
i
guess,
with
your
opponents
on
that
isolated
point
is
that
you
say
there's
got
to
be
more
than
one
threat,
just
as
there
has
got
to
be
more
than
one
hostile
remark,
if
you
will,
in
order
to
create
the
environment?
unknown
speaker
one...
one
instance--
unknown
speaker
--and
you're
saying
that
the
fact
that
the
hostile
environment
and
the
unfulfilled
quid
pro
quo
situation
is
created
by
a
supervisor,
with
more
authority
than
let's
say
just
a
fellow
employee,
that
doesn't
make
any
difference
in
the
calculus
of
how
many
instances
there
have
got
to
be
before
we
can
conclude
that
the
environment
has
in
fact
become
hostile;
you're
saying
that
really
is
not
relevant?
unknown
speaker
okay.
mr.
casey,
you...
you
formulated
this
question,
a
claim
of
quid
pro
quo
sexual
harassment.
now,
what...
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
term
"quid
pro
quo
sexual
harassment"?
unknown
speaker
simply
where
it's
proposed
or
where
it
happens?
unknown
speaker
where
it
happens?
unknown
speaker
you
mean--
--where
it
happens?
unknown
speaker
yes.
but...
and--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
but
it's
curious,
because
you
say
that
where...
where
the
woman
says,
okay,
i
will
sleep
with
you,
and
he
does
promote
her,
so
that
there
is
a
quid
and
there
is
quo
for
the
quid,
that
is
not
quid
pro
quo.
but
where
she
refuses,
she
does
not
give
the
quid,
and
therefore
does
not
get
the
quo,
that
is
quid
pro
quo?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
it's
an
interesting
theory.
unknown
speaker
and
in
the
case
where
it
is...
in
the
case
where
it
is
the
violation,
he
makes
the
proposition,
it's
refused,
and
she
is
not
promoted,
and
the
person
who
did
it
is
the
vice
president
of
the
company,
why
doesn't
the
company
know
about
it?
he
knows
about
it.
he's
the
vice
president.
he
is
the
company.
so
why
isn't
the
company
the
actor?
why
does
he--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
so
then
you're
just
using
the
same
arguments
that
were
in
this
other
case.
there's
nothing
new
here?
i
guess
it
puzzles
me
that--
--is
that
right?
--if
she
does
acquiesce,
the
law
gives
her
a
remedy.
if
she
doesn't,
it
doesn't
give
her
a
remedy.
so
the
law
favors
submission,
as
i
understand
it.
unknown
speaker
but
if
we're
talking--
--i'm
assuming
he's
bluffing
in
both
cases.
in
both
cases
he's
bluffing.
unknown
speaker
but
in
your
view,
there...
in
your
view...
this
is
what
i
was
trying
to
get
at...
there
is
nothing
in
this
case
in
respect
to
authority,
apparent
authority,
agency...
all
the
things
that
we
discussed
in
previous
cases
that
were
recently
argue...
in
that
area,
there
is
nothing
different
here;
the
only
thing
that
is
different
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
the
quid
pro
quo
is
in
fact
substantively
irrespective,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
but
i
know
that
you...
i'm
trying
to
figure
out,
is
there
anything
in
the
question
that
we
are
being
asked
to
decide
that
is
different
from
the
question
in
the
two
cases
that
were
recently
argued
here?
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
one
thing
that
seemed
different.
we're
asked...
which
is
what
i
thought
the
question
meant...
whether
there
is
a
substantive
violation
of
the
statute,
nothing
to
do
with
vicarious
liability.
unknown
speaker
and
now,
other
than
that,
is
there
anything
different?
unknown
speaker
and
what
is
that?
unknown
speaker
so
if
i
believe
it's
strict
liability,
there's
nothing
different?
if
i--
unknown
speaker
--but
that...
that's
what
we
didn't
grant
certiorari
on.
that's
the
second
question.
unknown
speaker
mr.
casey,
how
did
all
this
come
up?
it
really
is
mystifying,
with
a
statute
that
doesn't
use
any
of
these
terms.
it
just
says
no...
thou
shall
not
discriminate
in
hiring,
firing
or
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
unknown
speaker
why...
why
should
that
be?
why
should
there
be
a
distinction
between
quid
pro
quo
and
hostile
work
environment?
what
is
the
law
trying
to
achieve
by
adopting
that
category...
by
adopting
that
dichotomy?
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
casey.
mr.
rossiello,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rossiello--
--well,
why
does
quid...
i'm
sorry,
go
ahead.
i'd
like
to
ask
you,
in...
in
a
situation
like
this,
where
we
take
it
that
the
supervisor
doesn't
follow
through
on
any
threat,
actual
or
implied,
of
failure
to
promote
or
something,
some
employment
action,
where
the
employer
does
not
follow
through
on
that,
the
harm
to
the
employee
seems
to
be
very
much
the
same
as
that
under
hostile
environment
claims.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
i...
i
don't
see
a
lot
of
difference
here
than
there
would
be
to
simply
a
hostile
environment
situation,
where...
where
the
threat
is...
is
not
carried
out.
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
just
don't
see
much
difference
now.
and
in
that
regard,
what
role
does
the
existence
of
an
employer
policy
and
method
for
handling
complaints
of
this
type
play?
does
it
go
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
employee's
belief
or
does
it
go
to
the
amount
of
damages
if
there's
liability?
what
role
does
that
play?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
suppose
it's
a
fabulous
policy
and
very
effective.
unknown
speaker
now,
what
role
does
it
play?
unknown
speaker
what
role
should
it
play,
if
it's
a
perfect
policy?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
might
it
go
to
the
reasonableness
of
the
employee's
understanding
when
some
comment
is
made?
i
mean
if
she
knows
perfectly
well,
look,
this
company
has
a...
a
good
policy,
and
if
i
say
something
higher
up
the
ladder,
it's
going
to
be
taken
care
of.
then
is
it
reasonable
to...
for
her
to
believe
that
there
is
some
serious
threat
out
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
we've
already
explored
the
possibility
that
this
is
very
much
like
hostile
environment
if
the
threat
isn't
carried
out.
you're...
you're
back
to
hostile
environment.
well,
it's
sort
of
a
hybrid.
if--
--well,
mr.
rossiello,
a
hybrid
of
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
wrong
with
that
belief?
unknown
speaker
could
i
follow
up
on
that?
unknown
speaker
you...
you
agree
that
where...
where
either
she
complies
and...
and
the
job
action...
threatened
job
action
isn't
taken
or
she
doesn't
comply
and
the
job
action
still
isn't
taken,
it's
like
hostile
work
environment.
isn't
it
also
true
that
where
she
doesn't
comply
and
the
job
action
is
taken...
she's
not
given
the
promotion
or
she's
fired...
is
anything
added
to
the
title
vii
analysis
by
saying
it
was
quid
pro
quo?
that
is
to
say,
suppose
the...
the
officer
of
the
company,
without
making
a
quid
pro
quo
proposition,
you
know,
didn't
say,
you
know,
unless
you
sleep
with
me,
you
won't
get
the
promotion,
but
simply
asked
the
woman
to
sleep
with
him,
she
didn't,
and
he
fired
her
for
that
reason.
without
having
made
any
quid
pro
quo
proposal,
would...
would
the
case
come
out
any
differently
if
that
could
be
established
than
it
would
if
he
had
made
the
proposal?
in
other
words,
isn't
the...
isn't
the
proposal
simply
evidence
of
the
fact
that
the
reason
she
was
fired
or
the
reason
she
didn't
get
the
promotion
was
sexual
discrimination?
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
you
don't
even
need
a
threat.
i
mean
if...
if--
unknown
speaker
--if
he
just
makes
a
sexual
advancement,
she
doesn't
comply,
she
is
fired
thereafter,
and
if
you
can
show
that
the
reason
for
the
firing
was
that
she
was
not
compliant,
you...
you've
established
a
case,
haven't
you?
unknown
speaker
whether
there's
been
the
threat
or
not.
the
threat
only
serves
as
evidence
of
the
reason
for
the
job
action.
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
in
a...
in
a
situation
in...
in
which
the
threat
is
not
carried
out,
then
i
take
it
quid
pro
quo...
the
quid
pro
quo
distinction
makes
a
difference
in
this
sense...
and
tell
me
whether
you
think
i'm
right.
as
i
understand
the
way
we've
been
using
the
term,
a
quid
pro
quo
threat
is,
by
definition,
a
threat
that
only
a
supervisor
can
make,
because
only
the
supervisor
has
got
the
power
to
do
whatever
is
threatened.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
that
a
supervisor's
threat,
simply
because
it
is
that
of
a
supervisor,
may
have
more
force,
may
be
more
powerful
in
creating
a
hostile
work
environment,
even
if
it's
only
made
once,
than
would
one
off-color
remark
or
one
proposition
by
a
fellow
employee
without
such
power.
do
you
agree
that
in
the
unfulfilled
quid
pro
quo
situation
there
might
be
that
difference?
unknown
speaker
which
is
essentially
an
evidentiary
difference.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
with
respect
to
that,
if
you've
got
a
supervisor
who
just
loves
to...
never
makes
kind
of
a
thing,
"if
you
don't,
then
i
will.
"
but
just
likes
to
make
the
atmosphere
fun
for
the
guys
and
dreadful
for
the...
for
the
women,
doesn't
ask
for
any
favors,
there's
just
all
of
these
remarks,
light
touching,
just
makes
it...
do
you
remember
way
back
in
the
beginning
of
the
world,
there
was
a
case
called
bundy,
and
there
were
secretaries
who
said,
we
don't
want
a
promotion,
and
nobody
is
threatening
to
fire
us,
but
this
is
awful
to
live
under
these
conditions.
so,
court,
don't
give
us
money,
just
tell
them
to
stop.
now,
where
does
that
kind
of
case
fit
in
this
picture?
unknown
speaker
but
nobody
ever
suggested
in
those
days
that
there
was
something
different
between
quid
pro
quo
and
a
hostile
environment
and...
and
vicarious
liability
on
the
one
hand
versus
knew
or
should
have
known
on
the
other.
it
seemed
to
be
all
one...
it
was
under
title
vii
and
there
was
one
standard.
unknown
speaker
well,
let
me
ask
you
this.
suppose
it
were
a
given...
suppose
we
would
hold
that
in
a
hostile
work
environment
case
there
is
liability
only
if
the
employer
is
negligent.
suppose
that
were
our
holding.
would
the
quid
pro
quo
distinction
then
be
important
to
you?
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
and
in
fact,
i
noticed
that
in
answering
justice
o'connor's
question
you
said,
but
in
a
quid
pro
quo
case.
and
now,
see,
you
attack
this
distinction
and
yet
you
use
it.
unknown
speaker
or
at
least
you
want
to
hold
it
in
reserve.
unknown
speaker
and
we
didn't
start
it,
mr.
rossiello,
lest...
lest
silence
indicate
consent.
[laughter]
when
we
used
the...
the
expression
in...
in
meritor,
we
were
referring
to
by...
what
was
by
then
a
well-established
body
of...
of
court
of
appeals
law.
i
mean
don't...
don't
put
it
on
us.
we
were
just--
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
why
it's
a
problem.
why
is
it
a
problem,
but
for
the
circumstance
that
you
have
here,
where
there
is
a
proposition
that
is
refused
and
no
punishment?
in
any
other
situation,
isn't
it
perfectly
useful,
or
is
it?
unknown
speaker
instructive.
but
i
mean
more,
doesn't
it
happen,
propositions,
every
day
of
the
week?
unknown
speaker
and
they're
sometimes
are
followed
by
punishment.
and
they're
also
sometimes
accepted
and
followed
by
the
lack
thereof.
unknown
speaker
so
there
is
actually...
but
if
there
is...
if...
to
go
back
to
our
case,
where...
where
there's
a
proposition
turned
down
and
no
punishment,
if
it
were
true
in
that
subset,
in
that
subset
of
quid
pro
quo,
that
it
is
not
a
violation
unless
it
is
a
hostile
work
environment,
which
depends
upon
circumstance
and
a
lot
more
than
just
the
bare
facts
i
stated,
how
can
you
win?
because
what
i'm
interested
in
your
answering
is,
in
the
opinions
below,
i
have
some
kind
of
impression
that
you
either
waive
that
or
they
said
that
that
isn't
in
the
case
or...
what...
can
you
explain
to
me
what
i'm...
what...
it
may
be
a
hostile
work
environment,
but
it
requires
further
factual
exploration,
and
there
is
a
seventh
circuit
opinion
that
suggests
this
whole
matter
was
waived
or
something.
unknown
speaker
could
you
respond
to
my...
what
i'm
worried
about?
unknown
speaker
what
are
we
supposed
to
do
if...
if...
or
what
am
i
supposed
to
do
if
i
thought
that
might
still
be
there,
in
light
of
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
hold,
not
what
they
should
have
hold...
held?
and...
and
in
light
of
the
fact
that
your
cross-petition,
i
take
it,
is
not
before
us?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
what
are...
what
would
i
do
in
this
case
if
i...
on
the
assumption...
i'm
not
saying
i
really
think
that...
but
on
the
assumptions
that
i
gave
you?
unknown
speaker
he
should
regret
that
we
did
not
accept
your
cross-petition,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
we
didn't
accept
it.
i
mean
that's
the
fact.
unknown
speaker
mr.
rossiello,
as
i
understood
what...
what
happened,
was
that
you
didn't
surrender
a
hostile
environment
case,
but
you
did
surrender
a
simple
negligence.
so,
in
other
words,
what
you
said
is
hostile
environment,
quid
pro...
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
there's
vicarious
liability
here.
so
i
think
what
the
majority
of
the
seventh
circuit
judges
said
you
gave
up
was
hostile
environment,
simple
negligence,
not
that
you
gave
up
hostile
environment
and
the
standard
is
vicarious
liability.
is
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
so
that
in
the
next
round
of
this...
let's
assume
you
win
this
round...
in
the
next
round,
if
it
is
determined
that
in
fact
when
a
supervisor
is
involved
and
the
action
involves
a
threat
of
using
the
authority
that
the
supervisor
has
been
given
by
the
company,
negligence
is
not
required.
a
stricter
standard
of
vicarious
liability
applies.
then
you're
home
free?
unknown
speaker
right.
but
the...
the
point
that
i
was
making
is
the
only
thing
that
you
have
conceded
out
is
company
liability
on
a
negligence
theory?
unknown
speaker
yes,
okay.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't...
i
just
don't
understand
your
response
about
his
using
authority
that
the
company
has
given
him.
the
company
hasn't
given
him
authority
to...
to
make
a
sexual
proposition
to
any
of
the
employees,
has
it?
unknown
speaker
and
i
assume
the
company
also
hasn't
given
him
authority
to
fire
a
woman
for
her
failure
to
comply
with
his
sexual
proposition.
unknown
speaker
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--where
it
occurs,
you
can
say
the
employer
has
acted.
i
don't
care
whether
this
officer
was
involved
or
not,
the
employer
has
acted,
where
the
firing
has
occurred.
but
where
the
firing
hasn't
occurred,
where
there's
been
no
employer
action,
i...
i
find
it...
i
find
it
much
more
difficult
to
leap
to
employer
responsibility
on
a
theory
that
the
supervisor
was
using
authority
employment...
the
employer
gave
him.
the
employer
didn't
give
him
any
authority
to
fire
somebody
for
failure
to
comply
with
his
sexual
advances.
unknown
speaker
you
can
finish
your
answer
briefly
to
justice
scalia's
question.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
rossiello.
ms.
underwood,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
even
when
the
employer's
policy,
which
the
woman
knew
about,
specifically
prohibits
this,
how...
how
could
you
possibly
say
that
the
employer
was...
was
changing
her
terms
and
conditions
of
employment?
the...
the
supervisor
was
violating
an
employer
policy
that
she
knew
about.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
in...
but
in...
but
in
that
instance,
the...
the
company
is
acting...
the
company
has
acted.
so
it
is
within
the
scope
of
employment.
but
if
it's
just
a
threat,
there's
no
action
within
the
scope
of
employment
for
agency
principles.
unknown
speaker
and
we'll...
we'll
leave
aside
hostile
environment
and
repeated
acts
and
pervasive
discrimination
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
could
say
that,
but
it's
not
true.
in
fact,
that
power
does
not
reside
in
that
officer.
it
has
explicitly
been
taken
away
from
him
by
the
company.
what
more
can
the
company
do
than
to...
you
know,
than
to
make
that
the
company
policy?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
that's...
that's--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
the
difference.
suppose
you
have
a
model
employer,
with...
with
policies,
with
grievance
procedures
and
so
forth.
then
you
have
a
threat
that
is
not
carried
out.
under
agency
principles,
there's...
the
scope
of
employment
doesn't
come
into
play,
because
nothing
has
happened
other
than
an
environment,
which
we
can
take
care
of
under
a
different
analysis.
unknown
speaker
but...
but
that's
never...
that's
never...
never
carried
out.
and
she
knows
that's
not
true.
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
then
she
also
learns
that
it's
not
carried
out
because
she
doesn't
acquiesce
and
nothing
happens.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
there...
there...
my
sense
of
the
thing,
if...
if
that
is
true,
is
that
there
simply
isn't
any
liability.
unknown
speaker
sure.
unknown
speaker
and
suppose
they
don't
discharge
the
person.
he
says,
i'll
discharge
you;
are
you
discharged?
unknown
speaker
he's
wanting
you
to
go
collect
unemployment
insurance.
i
don't
think
they'll
give
it
to
you.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and
this
doesn't
penalize
an
attempt
to
discharge.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
so
it...
it...
if
it's
say
you
can't
discharge,
you
can't
hire,
you
can't
discriminate
on
terms
of
employment.
so
why,
if
in
fact
you
don't
discharge
the
person
but
say
you're
going
to
but
you
don't,
if
that
doesn't
violate
the
statute,
why
would
it
violate
it
to
say,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
a
promotion,
and
then
you
do?
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
it
is,
i'm
going
to
make
you
work
in
timbuktu,
or,
i'm
going
to
make
you
do
some
other
thing
terrible,
but
you
don't.
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
has...
if
it
has...
if
it
has
the
bad
effect,
if
they
do
something
bad,
she's
hurt.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
saying
the
simple
statement
of
saying
it...
so
if
you
say
something
that
never
happens,
because
the
person
is
a
woman
and
it
doesn't
create
a
hostile
environment,
it
still
is
actionable?
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood,
supposing
this
supervisor
had
two
employees,
one
a
man
and
one
a
woman.
and
he
says
to
the
man,
i
can
make
your
life
a
lot
easier
here
if
you
let
me...
you
let
me
use
your
beach
place
every
weekend,
and
he
says
to
the
woman
what
was
said
here.
now,
is
a
case
of
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
sex
made
out
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
he's...
he's
asking
favors
from
both
males
and
females.
unknown
speaker
i
see.
so...
so
your
answer
might
be
different
if
he
hadn't
asked
the
male
employee
to
lend
him
his
beach
place,
but
rather
made
a
sexual
overture
to
the
male
employee.
then
he
would
have
been
making
sexual
overtures
indiscriminately,
and
there
would
have
been
no
sexual
discrimination
towards
either
party;
is
that
your--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
it
is.
it's
an
impossible
case,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
ms.
underwood--
unknown
speaker
--no,
finish...
i
thought
you
were
finished.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
and...
and
then
the
next...
and
the
next
day,
a
new
supervisor
comes
in
and
says,
we're
sorry
about
that;
that's
wrong.
was
there
a
violation?
they
worked
for
1
hour
under
the...
under
the
employee
who
behaved
wrongfully.
unknown
speaker
is
there
any
case
in
any
area
of
the
law...
i'll
focus
on
the
word
"discharge",
because
it
clarifies
it
conceptually.
i
want
to
take
out
of
your
thought
the
problem
of
the
bad
environment.
so
we're
not
talking
about
a
bad
environment
at
all.
is
there
any
case
in
labor
law,
law
of
contract?
you
know,
there...
there
is
lots
and
lots
of
law
where
it's
unlawful
civilly
to
discharge
someone.
and
is
there
any
instance
where
a
person
could
recover
where
he
wasn't
discharged?
it's
somebody
who
said,
i
will
discharge
you,
but
he
didn't.
i...
i
can't--
unknown
speaker
--all
right.
then--
unknown
speaker
--is
there
any
case,
then,
under
title
vii...
well,
but
it's...
you
see,
it's
in...
it's
lined
up
certain
things:
hiring,
discharge
and
discriminating
in
terms
of
conditions
of
employment.
so
the
question
would
be
the
same
for
each.
that
is,
where
there
was
no
discharge,
where
there
was
no
hiring,
where
there
was
no
discrimination
in
terms
or
conditions
of
employment,
but
simply
a
threat
to
make...
to
do
those
things
that
was
not
carried
out.
now,
is
there
any
precedent
that
would
make
the
threat
in
any
of
those
areas
equivalent
to
the
reality?
unknown
speaker
and
can
we
tell
from
just
the
first
threat...
and
this
is
the
problem,
ms.
underwood,
that
i
had
understanding
the
government's
position...
there
could
be
a
threat
and
the
company
could
have
a
very
strong
policy.
so
you
really,
looking
at
it
as
an
observer,
you
can't
tell
whether
it
would
be
reasonable
for
the
worker
to
believe
that
the
threat
is
anything
more
than
a...
a
slight
of
the
kind
that
is...
we...
we
all
have
to
accept.
so
i
can
understand
a
series
of
threats
as
making
for
a
hostile
environment.
but
i
don't
understand
just
a
single
threat.
and
you
seem
to
say
that
a
single
threat,
whether
carried
out
or
not,
it...
it
qualifies
for
liability.
unknown
speaker
but
suppose
all
you
have
is
this...
you
have
this
vice
president,
who
is
a
pest.
and
you
have
a
strong
policy.
and
you
have
only
those
two
things.
how
do
you...
how
do
you
know,
when
he
makes
his
first
threat?
unknown
speaker
why
does
the
threat...
why
does
the
threat
make
a
difference?
in
the
example
you
gave
earlier,
about
racial...
racial
discrimination
in
employment,
why...
why
is
it
any
worse...
why
does
it
affect
the
working
conditions
any
more
if
the...
if
the
officer
of
the
company
says,
because
you're
black,
i'm
going
to
make
your
work...
unless
you
work
twice
as
hard,
unless
you
black
employees
work
twice
as
hard,
you're
going
to
be
fired...
why
is
that
any
worse
than...
than
the
officer
who
says,
because
you're
black
employees,
i'm
going
to
give
you
twice
as
much
work?
now,
there...
there's--
unknown
speaker
--there
is
no
quid
pro
quo
in
the
latter
case.
unknown
speaker
they're
not
saying,
unless
you
do
this,
i'll
do
that.
they're
saying--
unknown
speaker
--right.
but
the
problem--
--so
the
threat
makes
no
difference?
unknown
speaker
what
you're
saying
is--
--but
you're
saying
it's
a
term
or
condition
even
if
the
person
is
bluffing
all
the
way
through?
you're
saying
it's
still
a
term
or
condition?
unknown
speaker
but
how
do
you
judge
that
just
on
the
basis
of
the
threat
alone?
i
mean,
we...
and
let
me
ask
you
how
you
factor
in
the
existence
of
a
policy
that
this
kind
of
thing
shouldn't
happen
and
this
is
how
you
complain
when
it
does?
unknown
speaker
but...
but
strict
liability,
which
is
what
you're
arguing
for,
will
not
encourage
that.
strict
liability
for
a
hostile
work
environment,
say,
or
for
a
quid
pro
quo,
say,
if
we
were
going
to
make
a
distinction,
does...
does
not
encourage
use
of
grievance
procedures.
it
encourages
laying
back
and
filing
a
lawsuit.
unknown
speaker
it
certainly
will
go
to
damages,
won't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
let
me...
let
me...
let
me
ask
you
this
question,
which...
which
i
think
is
behind
some
of
the
things
that
are
bothering
us.
take
an
easy
case
in
which
there's
a
company
policy,
but
there
have
been
25
threats
from
the...
from
the
particular
supervisor.
and
he
had
done
everything
that...
that
he
could
reasonably
do
to
make
it
clear
that
he's
going
to
follow
through
on
the
threat,
but
the
moment
for
doing
so
has
not
yet
occurred.
the...
the
next
job
evaluation
has
not
come
up
yet.
the
reason,
if
i
understand
your
argument,
that
those
threats...
repeatedly,
et
cetera...
changed
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment
is
the
same
reason
that
we
say
other
actions,
perhaps
even
of
co-employees,
create
hostile
environments.
it
does
create
a
hostile
environment,
and
the
hostility
is
in
fact
a
change
of
condition.
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
okay.
but
leave...
leave
aside
the
question
of
what
the
standard
of
imputed
liability
is
going
to
be.
just
go
the
question
of
violation.
and
i
take
it
on
the
question
of
violation,
the
two...
the
two
instances
are
identical
in
your
analysis?
there
are
evidentiary
differences,
but
conceptually
they're
identical;
is
that
correct?
