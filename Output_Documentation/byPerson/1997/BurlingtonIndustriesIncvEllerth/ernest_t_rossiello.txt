mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
express
language
of
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964
specifies
that
three
elements,
and
three
elements
only,
must
be
demonstrated
to
establish
a
violation
of
that
statute.
there
must
first
be
employer
action;
secondly,
posited
upon
a
discriminatory
basis;
and,
third,
the
discriminatory
conduct
must
alter
the
terms
and
conditions
of
employment.
the
only
issue
for
this
court
to
decide
is
whether
or
not
mr.
slowik's
conduct
in
this
case
was
employer
action
within
the
meaning
of
42
u.s.c.
2000e-2
(a)(1).
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
that's
correct.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
well,
the
harm
could
or
might
be
the
same.
for
purposes
of
damage...
for
purposes
of
damages
or
the
harm
inflicted,
it
could
be
the
same
for
hostile
work
environment.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
it
goes
to
the
amount
of
damages.
the
existence
of
a
policy
has
little
or
no
effect
on
the
liability
issue.
in
this
particular
case,
the
policy
we're
talking
about
is
a
single,
flimsy
sentence,
buried
amid
two
very
brief
paragraphs--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--if
we
can
find--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--excuse
me?
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
little
to
none
on
the
liability
issue.
because
the
express
language
of
title
vii
does
not
require
that
the
plaintiff
follow
a
policy
or
complain
to
the
employer
before
it
goes
to
the
eeoc--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--the
short
answer
to
that
is
yes.
the
existence
of
a
policy
does
affect
the
reasonableness
of
the
plaintiff's
conduct.
most
often
that
would
be
in
a
hostile
work
environment-type
case.
in
a
quid
pro
quo-type
case--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--well,
some
case...
if
you
look
at
judge
wood's
opinion,
the
first
one,
that
was
vacated
in
the
seventh
circuit,
she
seems
to
believe
that
quid
pro
quo
sexual
harassment
also
is
a
hostile
work
environment.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
nothing.
i
think
it's...
not...
nothing
at
all.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
sure.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
yes.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
because...
right.
the...
if
the
threat
is
discriminatory
in
nature
and
if
it
affects--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--you
don't
need
much
necessarily.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
yes,
you
have.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
yes.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
right.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
well--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--there
is.
it's
a
question
of
proof.
right.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
we're
only
on
summary
judgment
here.
the
district
court
has--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--well,
that
is
discriminatory
conduct
within
the
meaning
of
title
vii.
as
both...
both
cases,
harris
and
meritor,
stated
when
the
work
environment
is
permeated
with
intimidation--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--well,
we
believe
there
should
be
one
standard.
i
mean,
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
meritor
is
a
wonderful
opinion,
but
i
don't
think
the
court
or
the
author
of
the
opinion
intended
to
wreak
the
havoc
that
it
did
when
it
used
those
words,
"quid
pro
quo",
and
"hostile
work
environment",
in
that
opinion.
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
and
the
district
courts
have
had
a
field
day
with
those
two
expressions.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
yes,
it
would
be.
[laughter]
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
well,
it's
so
hard
to--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--you
see,
it's
so
hard
to
avoid
it.
there
is
just
such
a
large
body
of
case
law
throwing
these
two
terms
around.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
all
right.
i
promise
not
to.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
well,
it
is...
it
is
instructive.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
yes.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
in
many
cases,
yes.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
right.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
yes...
yes,
i
can.
and
that
inquiry
of
your
honor
is
treated
at
great
length
in
our
cross-petition
for
certiorari.
by
the
time
the
seventh
circuit
got
through
its
203-page
decision
below,
i
think
that
hostile
work
environment
claim
got
lost
in
the
shuffle.
we
think
there's
enough
in
the
record
that
we...
it
hasn't
been
waived.
and
if
the
court--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--no.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
well,
i
would
remand
this
case
for
reconsideration
of
the
whole
claim.
[laughter]
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
well--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--well,
it's
still
pending.
we
have
our
foot
in
the
door.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
yes,
i
believe
that's
an
accurate
characterization.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
yes.
just
as
justice
breyer
said
a
few
minutes
ago,
you
know,
when
this...
this
type
of
conduct
is
engaged
in
by
a
vice
president,
he
is
the
company
and
the
company
is
him.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
for
sure.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
if
there
are
no
more
questions--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--that's
true,
the
company
has
not.
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
no,
absolutely
not.
that's
why
the
cases
in
our
brief,
which
are
other
types
of
title
vii
cases,
where--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--where
a
firing
or
discharge
or
a
demotion
or
a
pay...
a
pay
differential
is--
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
--well,
there's
where
you...
we
get
into
the
hair
splitting.
that's
very
true.
the
employer
did
not
give
the
authority
to
sexual
harass.
no
employer
does
that
as
far
as
i
know.
in
fact,
in
the
face
of
an
explicit
policy
against
sexual
harassment,
this
type
of
conduct
still
occurs.
but
where
a
supervisor,
like
in
this
case,
mr.
slowik...
should
i
just
finish?
mr.
ernest
t.
rossiello
all
right.
but
where
a
supervisor
uses
the
authority
delegated
in
him
in
general
to
accomplish
the
sexual
harassment,
title
vii
has
been
violated.
thank
you
very
much.
