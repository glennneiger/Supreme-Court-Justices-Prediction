ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
a
supervisor
tells
an
employee
she
has
to
provide
sexual
favors
in
order
to
get
a
promotion,
he
is,
at
that
moment,
imposing
a
term
or
condition
on
her
employment
because
of
her
sex,
in
violation
of
title
vii.
that's
true
whether
she
complies
or
refuses.
and
if
she
refuses,
whether
she's
punished
immediately
or
has
to
suffer
anxiety
about
the
result.
no
matter
how
she
responds,
this
supervisor
has
used
the
power
of
the
employer--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--just
as
when
a
supervisor
fires
someone
or
demotes
someone--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--justice
kennedy,
there
is.
the
power
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
power
to
fire
or
to
hire,
to
promote
or
demote,
includes
the
power
to
state
what
the
conditions
are
for
doing
that,
to
hold
out
threats
and
promises.
in
fact,
that's
the
way
that
power
is
most
commonly
and
effectively
and
predictably
used
in
the
management
of
a
company.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
the
company
has
given
him
the
power
to
hire
and
fire,
but
not
to
do
it
for
wrongful
reasons.
and
just
so,
the
company
has
given
him
the
power
to
hold
out
the
prospect
of
hiring
and
firing,
promoting
and
demoting--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--but
not
to
do
it--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
a
great
deal
has
happened.
the
employee
has
now
been
told
that
her
work
assignment
and
the
conditions
of
her
work
are
different
and
the
terms
on
which
she
can
get
a
promotion
are
different.
just--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
she
doesn't
know
it's
not
true.
she
knows
that
the
company
has
stated
that
it's
against
company
policy.
that's
not
quite--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--if
there
are
no
damages,
then
that
would
be
a
matter
for
damages.
in
this
case--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
suppose
the
company
fires
somebody
and
she
complains
and
she
immediately
is
reinstated.
there
will
still
be
a
violation.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
there
will
be
minor
damages.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
you're
not
discharged.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
it
doesn't.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
this...
this
isn't
just,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
a
promotion.
if
it
were
just,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
a
promotion--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
what...
what
distinguishes
this
is
the...
the
coercive
effect
it
has
right
now.
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
a
promotion
because
you're
a
woman,
i
would
say,
is...
is
not
a...
is
not
now
changing
the
condition--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--right.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
not
if
they
say
because
she's
a
woman,
because
that
isn't
attempting
to
coerce
her
to
do
anything.
there's
nothing
really
she
can
do
to
stop
being
a
woman.
it's
when
the
statement
is,
i
won't
promote
you
unless
you
do
something.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
if
it's
on
the
basis
of
using
your
beach
place,
then
it's
not
on
the
basis
of
sex.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
oh,
i
see.
well,
i
think
that
if
he's
asking
female...
favors
from
females
on
the
basis
of
sex,
then
he
is
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
sex
against
them.
and
he
may
also
be
engaging
in
other
improper
conduct
with
respect
to
other
people.
but
i
think
the...
the
point--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
that...
that's
the
hardest
case
for
the
sex
discrimination
proposition.
but--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--yes.
[laughter]
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
but...
but...
yes.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
i
want...
i
wanted,
in
response
to
some
of
those
questions,
to
suggest
that,
for
instance,
if
an
employer
said
to
the
women
employees
or
to
the
black
employees
that
you
have
to
work
twice
as
hard
as
the
men
do
in
order
to
keep
your
job
or
to
get
a
promotion
or
you
have
to
do
twice
as
much
work
or
you
have
to
work
twice
as
fast
or
you
have
to
do
the...
the...
you
have
to,
in
addition
to
doing
all
the
other
aspects
of
your
job--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there's
a
violation
with
de
minimus
consequences.
you
can
always
produce
a
trivial
version
of
a
violation.
there
was
a
violation.
there
have
been
cases
in
the
lower
courts
where
there
was
a
remand
to
the
district
court
for
a
factual
inquiry
to
determine
whether
what
happened
was
so
trivial,
so
de
minimus
as
not
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--not...
not
if
the
only--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--there
is
not
the
case
that
to...
that
a
discharge
is
equivalent
to
a
promise
to
discharge.
but
title
vii
prohibits
more
than
discharges.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
would
describe
the
threat...
if...
if
you
describe
the
threat
as
altering
her
job
responsibilities,
altering
what
she
has
been
told
she
must
do
to
get
a
promotion,
then
the
answer
is
yes.
but--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--a
genuine,
credible
threat,
which
could
be
communicated,
depending
on
the
circumstances
of
the
particular
case,
by
one,
serious,
credible
statement
by
somebody
who
is
known,
for
instance,
to
have
carried
out
such
threats
in
the
past,
notwithstanding
the
wonderful
policy--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
i
think
you
have
an
issue
of
fact
about
whether
a
genuine,
credible
threat,
sufficient
to
support
liability,
has
been
made.
i
think
that
on
this
record,
more
was
alleged
than
one
statement.
and
sum...
enough
was
alleged
to
resist
summary
judgment.
what
we
have
in
this
case,
after
all,
is
the
initial
statement,
i
can
make
life
difficult
for
you;
then,
i'm
reluctant
to
promote
you;
then,
after
she's
promoted,
i
won't
give
you
permission
to
do
the...
the
job
that
you
need
to
do
for
your
customer
unless
you
comply
with
my
sexual
demands.
in
each
case,
a
coercive
statement
is
made.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i...
i...
i--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--no,
i
think
they're
the
same.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
they
are,
in
each
case,
imposing
a
new
term
or
condition
on
employment
by
reason
of
race,
in...
in
the
hypotheticals
that
you've
posed.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
no,
the
threat...
the
threat
can
be
the
mechanism
by
which
the
new
condition
is
imposed.
and
in
this
case,
and
in
other
sexual
harassment
cases,
it
sometimes
is.
but
no,
it's
not
the
only
way
a
new
term
or
condition
can
be
imposed
on
someone's
employment.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
i'm
saying
it's
a
term
or
condition
if
it
is--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
if
he
says
it
in
a...
in
a
sufficiently
credible
manner,
so
that
she
now...
and
everyone...
and
other
people
in
the
work
place
to
whom
it's
said...
anybody
to
whom
it's
said
understands
that
to
be
a
new
term
of
employment
under
which--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
in
general,
it
seems
to
me
a
good
complaint
procedure
will
serve
many
functions.
one
is
that
it
will
prevent
some
violations.
another
is
that
prompt
reporting
will
tend
to
corroborate
the
plaintiff,
and
failure
to
use
it
will
tend
to
raise
questions
about
her
credibility.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
well,
i
don't...
it's
not
so
clear
that
that's
so.
because
one
consequence
of
laying
back
and
filing
a
lawsuit
is
to
minimize,
to
reduce
the
credibility
of
the
plaintiff
who
says
that
something
happened
but
never
complained
to
anybody
about
it.
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
it
would
go
absolutely
to--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--well,
it
is
similar
to
the
hostile
environment
created
by
coworkers
in
the
way
that
you
suggest.
the
difference
is
that
when
hostile
environment
is
created
by
coworkers,
there
is
an
issue
about
whether
the
company
is
properly
responsible,
because--
ms.
barbara
d.
underwood
--the
harm...
yes,
the
harm
that's
caused
is
caused
in
the
same
way.
i
see
the
light.
