mr.
james
j.
casey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
is
an
employer
strictly
or
automatically
liable
for
job-related
threats
made
in
conjunction
with
sexual
advances
when
the
employee
has
suffered
no
tangible
job
detriment
for
the
rejection
of
those
advances...
in
other
words,
the
unfulfilled
threat?
we
submit
that
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
strict
or
automatic
liability
should
not
be
applied
in
a
situation
of
unfulfilled
threats,
but
rather
should
be
analyzed--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--yes.
mr.
james
j.
casey
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
justice,
the...
the...
the
question...
question
1
is
the
un...
is
whether
or
not
the
strict
liability
standard
ought
to
apply
in
the
unfulfilled
threat
situation,
where...
where
there
is
no
adverse
job
consequence.
mr.
james
j.
casey
yes,
justice.
under--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--under...
under
the
assumption,
justice,
that
in...
that
most
courts,
who
have
addressed
the
issue,
have
addressed
quid
pro
quo
as
a
strict
liability
issue.
and
that's
why
i
referred
to
the
strict
liability
for
the
unfulfilled
threat.
and...
and
that's
why
i
believe
it
is...
it
is
cognizable
under
question
1,
which
is
the
question
that
the
court
did
accept.
you
are
quite
correct
about
that.
but
almost
all
of
the
courts
who
have
addressed
quid
pro
quo
sexual
harassment
have
addressed
it
under
the
theory
of
strict
liability
for
the
employer,
where
there
has
been
a
adverse
job
action,
such
as
a
termination
of
employment,
a
demotion,
a
transfer
to
a
less
fulfilling
job,
a
loss
of
benefits.
these
are
all
tangible
job
detriments,
where
the
company
has
acted,
through...
through
a
supervisor.
mr.
james
j.
casey
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
casey
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and...
and--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--no,
it
does
not.
it--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--it
does
not,
your
honor.
but
the
courts
who
have
addressed
the
other
violations
of
title
vii,
for
example,
in
race
cases,
have
attached
strict
liability
to
the
employer
when
the...
the
supervisor
has
taken
an
adverse
job
action,
such
as
a
termination
of
someone
because
of
their
race,
a
refusal
to
hire
someone
because
of
their
race,
a
termination
of
someone
because
of
their
national...
their
national
origins,
because
of
their
religion.
courts
have
viewed
that
as
employer
strict
liability.
on
the
other
hand,
when...
when
in
a
race
case,
for
example,
a...
a
person
is
living
in...
in
a
hostile
racial
work
environment,
or
a
hostile
environment
to
one's
religion,
or
a
hostile
environment
because
one
happens
to
be
korean
or
indian
or...
or
english,
that
has
been
viewed
as
whether
or
not
the
company
has
been
negligent
in
permitting
that
hostile
work
environment
to
exist.
mr.
james
j.
casey
oh,
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
casey
this
is
a...
this
is
a
claim
for
discrimination
by
reason
of
one's
gender.
mr.
james
j.
casey
it...
it
does,
indeed.
this
court,
in
meritor,
acknowledged
at
least
a
distinction
between
the
hostile
work
environment
and
quid
pro
quo.
this
court,
in
the
harris
forklift
opinion,
by
noting
that
the
harris
case
was
not
a
quid
pro
quo
case,
implicitly
recognized
the
distinction.
i
think
the
same
distinction,
your
honor,
has
been
made
in
the
other...
in
the
other
type
violations
of
title
vii,
in
terms
of...
of
race
and
national
origin,
where
there
has
been
an
act.
mr.
james
j.
casey
not
from
this
court.
there
have
been...
there
are
many
circuits
who
have...
who
have
recognized
that...
that
the
hostile
environment...
the
racially
hostile
environment
is...
is
a
negligence
issue.
and...
and
the
standard
the
company
or
the
employer
is
held
to
is
whether
the...
whether
the
employer
knew
or
should
have
known
of
the...
of
the
racially
hostile
environment.
and...
and
the
same
distinction
is...
is
what
we
are
urging
the
court
to
adopt
in
the
sexual
harassment
case.
mr.
james
j.
casey
in
that
one
instance,
i
would
say
there
is
not.
mr.
james
j.
casey
there
is
not
a
violation.
mr.
james
j.
casey
if...
if
there
was
repeated...
repeated
and...
and
repeatedly
hostile
comments
made
by
the
supervisor
to
the
employee
because
of
his
national...
i
think
there
then
would
be
a
violation.
but
here--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--i
do.
i
do
exactly.
here
there
was
an
implicit
threat:
i
could
make
your
job
easier
or
harder
for
you.
that
was...
that's
the
kind
of
threat
we
talked
about.
and
it
was
at...
at
a
job
promotion
instance.
and
in
this
case--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--yes.
mr.
james
j.
casey
i
think...
i
think
there
is
no
harm.
i
think
there
is
no
harm.
although--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--well,
i
don't
think,
your
honor,
that
one
insult
is
sufficiently
severe
to
rise
to...
to
a
hostile
environment,
as...
as
bad
as
it
may--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--your
honor,
in...
in
the
example
you
just
gave,
i
believe
that
there...
there
is
very
likely
a
quid
pro
quo.
she
has
been
ordered
off--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--all
right.
the
assumption
is
that...
that
she's
ordered
to
an
isolated--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--okay.
mr.
james
j.
casey
okay.
he
has
acted.
he
has...
he
has
used
the
authority
vested
in
him
by...
by
his
employer.
he
has
then
acted
on
behalf
of
the
employer,
and
i
believe
there
may
well
then
be--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--by...
by
issuing
orders
to
isolate
an
employee,
i
believe
he
is
using
the
authority
vested
in...
in...
in...
vested
in
him
by
the...
by
the
employer.
mr.
james
j.
casey
no,
your
honor.
mr.
james
j.
casey
because
it--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--because
he...
he...
he
has
one...
well,
in
terms
of
the
hostile
environment,
your
honor,
the...
the
courts
have
routinely...
the
circuit
courts
of
appeal
have
routinely
held
that
a
single
incident--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--for
liability...
your
honor,
for
liability,
for
an
employer
to
attach
in
an
hostile
work
environment,
there
has
to
be
some...
some
indication
to
the
employer
that
he
knew...
the
employer
knew
or
should
have
known.
mr.
james
j.
casey
because,
your
honor,
in...
in
the...
in
the
example...
or
the
hypothetical
that
your
honor
posits,
the
supervisor
has
done
nothing
but
speak
words.
he
has
not
exer--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
in
justice
o'connor's
hypothetical,
as
i
understood
it,
the...
the
supervisor
repeatedly
ordered
the
employee
off
to
a
isolated
place
where...
where
he
could
then
take
advantage
of
the
employee.
and...
and
it's
the
acting--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--your
honor,
in
a...
in
a
submission
case,
i
would...
i
would
argue
that,
in
a
submission
case,
that
if
the
employee
reasonably
believed
that
submission
was
a
term
and
condition
of
employment,
i
believe
then
there
would
be
strict
liability...
if
she
reasonably
believed--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--in...
if
i
can
modify
my...
not
modify
my
answer,
but
if
i
can
clarify
my
answer
on...
on
the
submission.
i
do
not
believe
in
a
case
such
as
we
have
here,
where
there
is
a
clear
policy
against
sexual
harassment,
where
there
are
avenues
of
redress
which...
which...
in
which
you
can
avoid
the
complaint...
complaining
through
the
offending
supervisor,
as
is
this
case
here,
where...
that
no
employee
then
could
reasonably
believe
what--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--on
summary
judgment.
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
we...
we
know...
we
know
something
in
addition
to
that,
your
honor.
we
know,
one,
there
was
a
policy.
we
know,
two,
in...
in...
in
following
this
court's
guidance
in
meritor,
that
there
were
avenues
of
redress
in
which
one
could
avoid
the...
the...
the
offending
supervisor.
and,
three,
we
know
that...
that
the
respondent
in
this
case
was
aware
of
the
policy,
understood
the
policy,
and
intentionally...
intentionally
did
not
follow
the
policy.
and
in
fact
stated
the
reason
she
didn't
tell
her--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--your...
your
honor,
and...
and
i'm
not
going
beyond
the
summary
judgment
record.
what
she...
what
she
testified
to...
and
it...
and
it
is
part
of
the
summary
judgment
record...
what
she
testified
to
is
that
she
intentionally
did
not
report
it
to
her
supervisor
because,
and
i
quote,
it
would
be
his
duty
to
report
it.
and
we
do
know
that.
and
we
do--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--that's
in
the
record,
your
honor,
at...
i
will
find
it,
your
honor.
but
it
is...
it
is
clearly
in
the
record,
and
it's
quoted
directly
in
our
brief.
mr.
james
j.
casey
i...
i
don't
understand.
mr.
james
j.
casey
your
honor,
i...
i...
perhaps
i
misspoke.
what
i
said
was
if...
what
i
meant
was...
if
an
employee
reasonably
believed
that...
that
submission
was
a
term
and
condition
of
employment
and
she
did
submit,
and
the
relief
was
reasonable,
then
i
believe
there
is...
there
would
be
a...
an
adverse
tangible
job
consequence.
mr.
james
j.
casey
in
the
hostile
work
environment,
unless
there...
there
is
some
evidence
that
the
employer
knew
or
should
have
known.
mr.
james
j.
casey
your
honor,
i
think
in
this...
in
the...
in
the
situation
you
describe--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--there
would
be...
there
would
be
the
standard
of
the
company
should
have
known.
if
it
is
as
open
and
notorious
as
your
honor
describes.
mr.
james
j.
casey
and
he
was
responsible
for
this
office?
mr.
james
j.
casey
i
believe...
i
believe,
your
honor,
if
he
was
aware
of
open--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--and...
open
and
notorious
conduct,
of...
of
a
hostile
environment
for
female
employees,
it
would
be
notice
to
the
company.
i
think
so.
just--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--because,
your
honor,
he
did
not
fulfill
the
threat.
he...
he
simply
implied
a
threat,
never
carried
it
out.
she
in
fact
got
promoted.
mr.
james
j.
casey
i'm
missing
the--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--i
do
not
believe
so.
i
do
not
believe
this
is
a
hos...
i
do
not
be--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--well,
if
there's
no
liability,
there's
no...
there's
no
violation.
mr.
james
j.
casey
no,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
and...
and...
and
i
don't--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--and
i
don't
think
it
rises
to
a
hostile
work
environment.
mr.
james
j.
casey
yes,
certainly.
mr.
james
j.
casey
your
honor--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--to
order
her
to
isolated
parts
of
the...
of
the
factory.
mr.
james
j.
casey
i
would...
in...
in
that
circumstance,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
is
quid
pro
quo,
because...
because
he
is
exercising
the...
precisely
the
authority--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--i
don't...
i'm
making
the
distinction,
your
honor.
i
interpreted
justice
o'connor's
question--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--i
think--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--no.
i
think,
your...
i
think,
your
honor,
that
isolation
and
constant
isolation
on
orders
of
a
supervisor
is...
is
an
adverse
tangible
job
consequence.
mr.
james
j.
casey
justice--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--justice--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--justice
o'connor's
question
was
repeatedly...
repeatedly
ordered
her
to
an
isolated
part
of
the
factory
so
he
could
do
that.
mr.
james
j.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
that's
correct.
that's
how...
exactly
how
i
interpreted
it.
mr.
james
j.
casey
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
environmental
hostility,
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
it...
justice
souter,
it
may
well
be
a
hostile
environment.
and
if
it
is
a
hostile
environment,
then...
then
we
look
at
it
as
a...
as
a
standard
of
negligence.
did
the
employer
know
or
should
the
employer
have
known?
mr.
james
j.
casey
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
one
instance
does
not
create
a
hostile
environment.
mr.
james
j.
casey
i...
i
don't...
i
do
not
believe
that
to
be
relevant.
mr.
james
j.
casey
my
understanding,
your
honor,
is...
is
this
for
that.
you
give
me
something,
and
i
will
do
something
either
negatively
or
positively
to
you.
there's
a
quid
and
a
quo.
and...
and
i
believe--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--where
it
happens.
mr.
james
j.
casey
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
--where...
where...
where
something
is
proposed
by...
by
the...
by
the
supervisor,
but
not
necessarily
acquiesced
in
by
the
employee,
i
take
it?
sleep
with
me
or
i
won't
promote
you,
i
mean,
is
the
classic
example
that
we
all
use.
mr.
james
j.
casey
and
i
don't
promote
you.
mr.
james
j.
casey
your
honor,
if...
if
he
gets--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--no...
no,
it's...
but
that's...
but
that's
not
precisely
the
theory.
the
theory
is
if...
if
she
gets
the
promotion
for
having
slept
with
him,
she...
she
got
something
she's
not
otherwise
entitled
to.
and
i
think
that
is...
that
is
discrimination.
and
i
think
that
is
a
violation
if
she
actually
didn't
get
the
promotion.
mr.
james
j.
casey
because
he...
he...
excuse
me,
i
didn't
mean
to
interrupt
you...
because
he
didn't
act
with
the
authority
given
him
by
the
employer.
mr.
james
j.
casey
no,
i
don't...
i
don't
think
that's
actually
the
case,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
it's
safer
for
submission
in...
in
any
event.
i
don't
think
there's
a--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--if
he's
bluffing
in
both
cases
and
she
had
no
reasonable
belief,
i
think
there's
no
violation.
mr.
james
j.
casey
in
the
face...
in
the
face
of
a
clear
policy
in
the
company,
she
could
not
reasonably
believe
that
he
had
the
authority
to
do...
there
is
no
apparent
authority--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--absolutely.
mr.
james
j.
casey
the--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--yes,
your
honor,
the
difference--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--the
difference
in
this
case
is
the
standard
of
liability
to
be
applied.
is
it
strict
liability
or
is
it
a
negligence
issue?
mr.
james
j.
casey
other
than
standard
liability,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
j.
casey
your
honor,
i'm...
i'm
tying
the
strict
liability
to
the
quid
pro
quo.
if
it
is
a
quid
pro
quo
case,
this
for
that,
i
believe
the...
the
cases
are...
are
quite
uniform
that
there
is
strict
liability.
and
in--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--justice,
it
came
up
in
the
context,
really,
of
the
other
violations
of
title
vii,
in
the
race
cases.
for
example,
the
company
is
automatically
liable
if...
if
the
person
is
fired
or
demoted
or
not
promoted
because
of
his
race.
and--
mr.
james
j.
casey
--well,
this
court
has...
has
instructed
us,
in
meritor,
that
we
should
look
to
agency
