justice
stephen
g.
breyer
am
i
right
in
my
understanding
of
your
answer
to
justice
stevens
that
(1),
(2),
and
(3)
are
exceptions
from
602?
they
all
deal
with,
let's
imagine
a
human
being
who
comes
to
the
border.
that
human
being
who
comes
to
the
border
got
his
book,
for
example,
some
way
or
other.
if
the
way
he
got
that
book
was
subject
to
the
first
sale
doctrine,
then
under
your
theory
you
wouldn't
need
(1),
(2),
or
(3),
but
if
it
was
not,
you
do
need
(1),
(2),
or
(3),
and
whether
that
category,
not,
is
big
or
little
or
medium-sized
is
beside
the
point.
it's
not
the
null
set.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
that
right?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
mean,
there
might
be
a
lot
of
people
who
have
those
books
coming
to
the
border
who
didn't
buy
them.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
in
which
case
there's
no
first
sale
doctrine
under
anybody's
theory.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
where
there
are
other...
yes.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--that
makes
sense,
but
i
don't
see
how
it
helps
you.
i
mean,
they
wanted
to
say,
suppose
that
i
bring
in
some
books
from
england,
and
really
they
are
perfectly
legitimate,
but
if
i
were
to
distribute
them
in
the
shop
it
would
violate
the
distribution
right
of
the
copyright
holder.
well,
602
says,
stop
them
at
the
border.
i
mean,
nothing
in
that
theory
tells
you
whether
they
are
or
are
not
subject
to
the
first
sale
doctrine.
it
wouldn't
hurt
if
they
were,
wouldn't
hurt
if
they
weren't.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
there's
been
a
first
sale,
no
more
reason
to...
no
more
reason,
if
there's
been
a
first
sale,
to
stop
them
than
if
there's
been
a
first
sale
in
the
united
states.
it's
the
same
problem.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
do
you
want
to
apply
a
first
sale
doctrine
to
copyrighted
books
or
not?
if
the
answer
is
yes,
why
distinguish
them
where
the
first
sale
was
abroad?
if
the
answer's
no,
treat
them
all
alike.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
but
he's
been
paid
for
it,
hasn't
he?
i
mean,
if
they're
legitimate
and
not
pirated,
he's
been
paid
for
that.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they
would
like...
the
copyright
holder,
i
take
it,
would
like
to
have
a
vertically
imposed
territorial
division,
as
would
many
manufacturers.
normally
we
control
that
through
the
antitrust
laws.
sometimes
you
can
do
it,
sometimes
you
can't.
why,
to
repeat
justice
o'connor's
question,
would
this
antitrust
issue
of
vertically
imposed
territorial
restrictions
suddenly
be
brought
into
the
copyright
law
when
it
isn't
brought
into
the
trademark
law
or
most
other
laws?
i
mean,
wouldn't
you
have
to
have
a
fairly
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent
to
find
it,
rather
than
the
other
way
around?
i
mean,
that's
basically
my
underlying
question
in
this
case.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes.
that's
also
true
when
you
sell
to
california.
it's
also
true
when
you
sell
to
maine.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
you
decide
to
sell
at
a
discount,
it
would
be
nice
to
do
that
often,
and
many
manufacturers
feel
that
way.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
you
can't
sell
at
a
discount
to
maine,
and
you
won't
be
able
to
to
france.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
is
actually--
[laughter]
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
it's
on
page
2
of
the
appendix
in
the
amicus
brief
that
mr.
olson
filed.
well,
isn't
it
on
page
2
of
the
red
brief?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
should
we
look,
for
example--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--is
it
the
case...
i'm
not
certain
at
all
about
this.
i've
a
recollection,
though,
that
the
european
court
of
justices
found
a
first
sale
right,
a
similar
kind
of
thing,
through
imports
from
one
country
to
another.
are
those
relevant,
too?
am
i
supposed
to
look
at
those
cases
to
see
which
way
they
come
out?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
why
is
the
government...
normally
the
government
takes
the
position,
with
what
i
consider
here...
you
can
see
the
analogy
to
territorial
restrictions
imposed
by
a
manufacturer.
normally
the
government
wants
those
viewed
under
a
rule
of
reason
and
is
often
hostile.
why,
in
this
case,
is
the
government
willing
to
forego
the
rule
of
reason
and
just
saying,
well,
they're
okay
across
the
board?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
is
602...
can
you--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--can
you
correct
this,
which
i'm
about
to
say:
602(a)
says,
the
act
of
importing
is
an
act
of
distribution.
602(b)
says,
if
what
you're
importing
is
a
pirated
copy,
i.e.,
one
that
would
have
been
unlawful
had
the
laws
of
the
united
states
applied
there,
you
can
seize
it,
customs
person.
if
it's
not
a
piratical
copy,
you
can't
seize
it.
you
just
notify.
so
(b)
is
explicating
(a).
now,
what's
wrong
with
what
i
just
said,
if
anything?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
(a)
is
covering
both.
(b)
says,
if
at
the
border
it's
a
pirate,
you
can
seize
it.
if
not,
you
can't.
you
notify.
