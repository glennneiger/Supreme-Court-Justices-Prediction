mr.
snyder,
i--
--of
course,
one
of
the
things
they...
just
on
this
point.
one
of
the
things
they
wanted
to
make
sure
of,
perhaps,
is
that
602
was
kept
intact
as
an
independent
provision,
because
602
says,
under
their
reading,
that
it
is
an
independent
act
of
infringement
to
import
without
the
consent.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
mr.
snyder,
if
you're
right
about
that,
wouldn't
it
have
been
more
logical
to
say,
in
the
first
part
of
501(a),
exclusive
rights,
section
106
through,
including
the
right,
the
602
right,
instead
of
making
it
conjunctive,
as...
instead
of
making
it
separate?
your
argument
would
fit
very
well
if
congress
had
said
602
belongs
with
106a,
but
it
makes
it
separate,
and
in
that
light,
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
point
about
the
representations
this
nation
has
made,
the
government
isn't
making
them
in
the
air.
it
does
point
to
this
501(a),
and
if
that's
a
plausible
reading,
even
if
we
don't
owe
chevron
deference,
don't
we
owe
some...
don't
we
give
some
weight
to
the
representations
our
government
has
made
to
other
governments?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
there's
one
other
language
point
that
the
government
makes
in
addition
to
its
501
argument.
it
refers
to
the
later
provision,
the
one
in
the...
what
is
it,
the
chip,
the
905
and
906,
and
that
906
includes...
906(b)
refers
not
simply
to
otherwise
dispose,
but
includes
the
word,
import,
and
the
argument
is,
and
when
congress...
congress
knows
there's
a
difference
between
importing
and
otherwise
disposing.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
you
think
it
was?
it
was.
well,
what
were
all
those
experts
who
testified
saying
they
needed
602
for,
including
ms.
harriet
spilpellan,
horace
man--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
wallace,
since
it's
obvious
that
there
is
some
ambiguity
here,
room
for
different
views,
since
the
government
was
taking
this
position
in
its
representations
to
other
nations,
why
didn't
it
ask
congress
for
a
clarifying
amendment
so
that
there
would
be
no
doubt
about
how
the
statute
should
be
read?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
i'm
talking
about
once
this
problem
surfaced.
now,
we
have
the
ninth
circuit
with
one
opinion,
the
third
circuit
with
a
different
one,
so
that
this
particular
problem
has
been
known
for
a
while,
and
as
far
as
i
know
there
hasn't
been
any
effort
to
get
congress
to
spare
the
judiciary
this
kind
of
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
then
you're
saying
this
is
not
a
very
important
issue
for
the
government,
however
important
it
is
for
private--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--participants.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
they
do
say
that
the
foreigners
have
to
advertise
it
on
their
own,
they
have
to
service
it,
it
doesn't
come
with
a
warranty,
so
there
is--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--there's
a
justification
for
the
differential.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
wouldn't
have
any
problem
if
you
just
changed
the
label,
right?
i
mean,
you
could...
you
could
do
everything
and
not
have
any
problem
about
importing
if
you
just
made
a
different
label.
