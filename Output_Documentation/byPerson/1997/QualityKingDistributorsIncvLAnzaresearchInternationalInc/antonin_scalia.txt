justice

scalia
well,
on
your
interpretation
of
the
statute,
actually,
that
it's
sort
of
an
import
violation
rather
than
a
distribution
violation,
it
really
ought
to
be
the
customs
service
to
whom
we
might
defer
rather
than
the
copyright
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
i
don't
understand
your
argument
that
just
because
the
copyright
office
had
much
to
do
with
the
drafting
of
this
provision
we
give
them
deference.
i
mean,
we
certainly
don't
give
general
motors
deference
if
they
have
had
substantial
participation
in
the
drafting
of
a
particular
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
you
don't...
you
do
not
contend
that
we
owe
them
deference.
justice
antonin
scalia
briefly,
you
want
to
assure
that
the
americans
can
sell
cheaper
in
that
country
than
they
do
at
home,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
briefly
put.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
even
do
that
at
home.
we...
you
know,
we
generally
don't...
don't
make
sure
that
people
can
sell
in
maine
cheaper
than
they
can
sell
in
california.
why
do
we
want
to
do
it
for
tobago?
justice
antonin
scalia
we're
talking
about
shampoo
here,
aren't
we?
i
mean,
these
people
don't
care
about
the
labels.
they're
trying
to
piece
out
the
market
for
shampoo.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it's
also
going
to
apply
to
shampoo.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
emphasizes,
it
seems
to
me,
the
statement
in
(a)
that
importation
is
not
a
violation
of
any
importation
restriction.
importation
is
only
a
violation
of
the
right
to
distribute.
that
sentence
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
--doubles
up
on
that
statement.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
put
it
more
kindly.
you
could
say
they
want
foreigners
to
pay
less.
that
seems
more
generous.
[laughter]
