mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
one
very
important
component
of
the
text
of
the
statute
which
i
believe
has
been
overlooked
in
the
discussion
thus
far
is
602
itself.
what
is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
the
very
last
page,
e-3,
is
not
all
of
section
602.
it
is
section
602(a),
which
is
in
substance
the
new
part
of
section
602.
section
602
also
contains
a
subsection
(b).
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
subsection...
the
602(a)--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--is
set
forth
in
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it's
not
set
forth
in
any
of
the
briefs,
the
text
of
it.
it's
the
very--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--i
say
that
it's
been
overlooked.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
all
right.
it's
on
page
2
of
the
red
brief,
then.
i'm
sorry.
in
any
event,
the
very
first
sentence
carries
forward
what
had
been
in
existence
in
somewhat
different
words
in
the
1909
copyright
act,
that
importation
of
piratical
copies
is
prohibited,
and
the
customs
service
is
given
authority
to
stop
those
at
the
border.
that
was
always
true.
what
is
added
in
602(a)--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--piratical
copies
are
copies
that
are
not
legitimate
in
the
country
where
acquired,
and
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--my
answer
is
no.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
authority
that
has
been
given
in
602(a),
the
new
authority,
allows
the
owner
of
the
copyright
to
prevent
without...
if
it
doesn't
have
his
permission,
to
prevent
importation
of
legitimate
copies
as
well
as
piratical
copies,
but
the
piratical
copies
are
prohibited
from
entry
separately
as
well,
under
602(b).
therefore,
the
exceptions
listed
in
602(a)
cannot
be
exceptions
to
allow
the
entry
of
piratical
copies
because
their
importation
is
already
prohibited
by
the
companion
provision.
it
can...
they
can
only
be
exceptions
to
allow
the
importation
of
copies
that
were
legitimate
copies
authorized
by
the
copyright
holder
where
acquired.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
however...
but
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
of
course,
we
have--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--yes,
but
we
have
agreements
with
these
countries
so
that
there's
reciprocal
recognition
of
copyright
rights,
and
the
british
copyright
is
very
apt
to
derive
from
the
american
copyright,
or
vice
versa,
depending
on
where
the
original
copyright
is,
so
that
we're
not
really
separating
out
very
much.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there...
the
goods
are
marketed
in
these
countries,
and
our
concern
in
negotiating
these
agreements
has
been
in
protecting
the
distributors
from
gray
market
imports
that
would
undermine
the
distribution
of
the
american
made
works
in
these
other
countries.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there...
that
is
part
of
the
reason
why
we
have
been--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
are
reasons
why
we've
been
espousing
this,
because
in
order
to
market
copyrighted
works,
and
the
whole
point
of
copyright
is
to
give
incentives
to
created
copyrighted
works
and
to
protect
their...
the
ability
of
the
authors
to
market
them--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
statutory
issue
is
going
to
apply
to
motion
pictures,
sound
recordings--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--when
the
label
that
is
affixed
to
it
qualifies
for
copyrighting.
this
is
a
venerable
part
of
the
copyright
law,
but
i
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
let
that
drive
this
case,
because--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
have
not
asked
for
deference,
nor
do
we
think
deference
is
the
right
approach
to
this.
we
do
believe
that
the
court
was
entitled
to
be
informed
about
this.
we--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
because
of
the
very
reason
that
the
court
gave.
we...
just
2
years
ago
in
the
case
of
vimar
seguros...
we
quoted
on
page
25
of
our
brief
one
sentence
from
the
opinion.
the
very
next
sentence
is
what
we
think
is
pertinent
here,
and
the
very
next
sentence
starts
out--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
we
didn't
quote,
and
the
very
next
sentence
starts
off,
that
concern
counsels
against
construing
the
act
differently.
that's
all
it
does.
it
is
a
factor
to
take
into
consideration--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--as
the
court
said.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
have
not
been
brought
to
my
attention,
and
we're
talking
here
about
construing
an
act
of
congress,
and--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
there
are
trade
restraints
in
copyrighted
and
patented
materials
that
are
not
permitted
elsewhere,
and
they're
permitted
under
statutes
that
congress
has
enacted.
we
really
think
the
answer
to
this
case
is
in
the
statutes
that
congress
has
enacted--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
i'm
not
privy
to
reasons
that...
why
it
did
not.
it
took
15
years
to
do
the
revision
in
1976.
it
started
off
at
the
very
beginning
of
the
1960's
with
a
series
of
studies
by
congress
and
the
committee
and
they
heard
from
a
great
many
people.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
not
a
problem
that
arises
in
government
litigation.
it's
not
just
the
government
that
might
have
come
forward.
in
fact,
we're
talking
now
about
the
rights
between
two
non-government
parties.
we
looked
in
connection
with
another
case
pending
before
this
court
and
didn't
find
a
single
pending
case
in
which
the
united
states
has...
a
single
reported
case
in
which
the
united
states
has
sued
anyone
for
copyright
infringement.
we're
not
usually
involved
in
this
litigation,
so
we're
not
necessarily
the
ones
who
would
come
forward
with
requests
for
an
amendment
that
might
clarify
something.
we
are
faced--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
it--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--we
do
think
it's
important
because
it
bears
on
positions
we've
been
taking
in
international
negotiations.
it's
important
to
the
government
in
that
way.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it's...
it
does
describe
this
case
for
purposes
of
what
the
customs
service
is
authorized
to
do.
congress
in
section
602
did
not
expand
the
authority
of
the
customs
service
to
prevent
importations.
that
is
still
limited
to
piratical
copies.
it
added
602(a)
to
give
the
copyright
owner
ability
to
move
against
copies
that
were
legitimate
in
the
country
in
which
they
were
acquired,
but
that
would
be
too
difficult
for
the
customs
service
to
try
to
distinguish
between
goods
that
may
or
may
not
be
violating
contractual
restrictions
on
their
distribution,
so
the
customs
service
still
has
the
same
authority
in
substance
that
it
had
before.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
right--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
right
to
distribute
is
covered
in
section
106b,
a
separate
section
in
a
separate
chapter
of
this
provision,
and
something
was
added
here
to
stand
alone
in
a
different
chapter,
and
there
are
a
series
of
exceptions
listed
which
the
petitioner
in
substance
is
saying
can
be
explained
because
they
would
allow
piratical
copies
in,
but
they
would
not
allow
piratical
copies
in.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
that--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--but
that
limits
very...
most
of
these
importations
that
are
listed
here
as
exceptions
would
have
been
ones
where
a
first
sale
of
a
legitimate
copy
occurred.
it
would
not
be...
would
not--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there's
nothing
in
the
copyright
law
that
allows
a
piratical
copy
to
be
brought
in.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
point
i've
been--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
point
i've
been
trying
to
make,
and
perhaps
i
haven't
explained
it,
is
that
602(b)
separately
prohibits
that.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
prohibits
the
import
of
any
piratical
copy.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
because
(a),
(a)
has--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
doesn't...
what
is
wrong
for
a
starter
is
that
602(a)
says
that
importation
is
an
infringement
of
the
exclusive
right
to
distribute.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
doesn't
say
it's
a
distribution.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
what
is
a
distribution
is
in
106(3),
and
importation
is
treated
separately
from
distribution
in
provision
after
provision
of
the
act,
as
we've
set
out
in
our
brief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you
very
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
it's
been
a
great
privilege.
