mr.
allen
r.
snyder
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
members
of
congress
in
1976
who
enacted
the
copyright
law
of
1976
would
be
quite
surprised
to
learn
from
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
below
that
congress
allegedly
intended
section
602
of
that
law
to
override
the
longstanding
and
fundamental
principle
in
copyright
law
known
as
the
first
sale
doctrine
and
thus
to
allow
a
manufacturer
to
control
the
import
and
the
subsequent
resale
of
particular
copies
of
goods
that
the
manufacturer
itself
had
already
sold.
this
ninth
circuit
decision
is
inconsistent
not
only
with
the
statutory
language
but
also
with
the
legislative
history
and,
indeed,
congress
simply
has
not
addressed
either
in
the
copyright
law
or
elsewhere
respondent's
efforts
to
curtail
parallel
imports--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--justice
o'connor,
i
believe
the
issue
before
the
court
is
what
did
congress
say
and
what
did
congress
intend
in
a
statute.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
believe
that
the
government
has
shown
that
in
several
bilateral
trade
agreements
that
were
never
submitted
to
congress
either
for
consideration
or
for
action,
the
government
has
asserted
the
position
in
dealing
with
the
governments
of
cambodia,
trinidad
and
tobago,
and
several
other
countries,
that
it
is
the
executive
branch's
position
that
parallel
imports
of
the
kind
at
issue
here
should
be
curtailed.
we
believe
that,
to
the
extent
the
government
is
relying
on
copyright
law
for
that
position,
that
it
is
up
to
congress
to
pass
the
law
and
set
the
policy,
and
it
is
up
to
this
court
to
interpret
that
position
of
congress
and
what
congress
said
and
meant.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
believe
not,
justice
o'connor.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
government
has
even
alleged
chevron
deference.
this
is
not
a
case
where
the
government
has
been
assigned
by
congress
any
duty
under
602(a).
there
are
no
regulations.
there
is
no
role
for
the
copyright
office
or
any
other
agency
of
the
executive
branch
to
administer
602(a).
it
is
solely
a
private
right
of
action,
and
under
those
circumstances
we
think
there
is
no
deference
to
be
accorded.
the
executive
branch
is
free
to
take
whatever
position
it
wishes
in
bilateral
negotiations,
but
if
their
positions
conflict
with
the
position
of
congress,
we
submit
they
should
go
to
congress
for
a
change
in
the
law.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
think
it's
correct
that
that
particular
language
could
have
been
omitted.
however,
it
would
have
raised
questions
where,
in...
for
courts
to
interpret
the
language,
since
section
106
obviously
deals
with
distribution
to
the
extent
we're
discussing
it
here,
and
we
all
agree
that
importation
is
not
literally
the
same
thing
as
distribution,
congress
chose
to
make
importation
part
of
the
distribution
right.
had
section
501
not
specifically
referred
to
importation,
someone
could
have
argued
that
the
reference
there
to
distribution
or
to
section
106
didn't
necessarily
cover
things
that
were
actually
dealt
with
in
602
but
not
literally
in
106.
i
think
it
was
a
situation
where
congress
appropriately
tried
to
be
sure
that
their
intention
was
crystal
clear.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
it
is
an
act
of
infringement.
however,
i
think
it's
not
totally
independent
in
the
sense
that
the
language
of
602
specifically
made
importation
a
violation
of
the
distribution
right
under
106,
so
as
we
interpret
the
language,
congress
was
saying
that
we
wish
to
make
importation
a
separate
type
of
violation
of
the
distribution
right.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
first
of
all,
justice
ginsburg,
501
obviously
is
not
the
section
that
specifically
was
dealing
with
either
the
distribution
right
or
the
importation
issue,
and
i
think
to
determine
congress'
intent,
the
first
place
that
i
would
urge
the
court
to
look
would
be
the
statutes
directly
on
point,
including
109,
but
i
take
your
point
that
it
could
have
been
phrased
in
a
different
way.
however,
i
would
suggest
respectfully
to
the
court
that
by
referring
in
602
to
the
rights
under
106,
congress
was
doing
something
that
really
made
quite
a
bit
of
sense,
and
that
is
that
all
of
the
panoply
of
conditions
and
exceptions
to
distribution
rights
that
are
contained
within
106
and
its
cross-referenced
sections
thereby
were
applied
here.
section
106
begins
by
saying,
subject
to
sections
107
through
120,
quote-unquote,
there
will
be
certain
exclusive
rights,
including
the
distribution
right.
those
exceptions
include
such
things
as
the
fair
use
doctrine,
which
is
a
quite
fundamental
element
of
american
copyright
law.
by...
by
making
602
a
part
of
the
106
right
and
cross-referencing
it
the
way
congress
did,
it
included
the
fair
use
doctrine,
the
first
sale
doctrine,
the
other
exceptions,
into
the
importation
rules
just
as
they're
in
all
the
other
parts
of
the
copyright
law.
section
501
simply
provides
for
the
enforcement
mechanism
for
all
of
the
rights,
and
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that,
because
it
lists
importation
as
an
additional
word
in
501,
it
really
doesn't
negate,
i
don't
believe,
the
intent
of
congress
in
the
operative
sections.
and
obviously
one
of
the
key
operative
sections
here
is
section
109,
and
109,
which
is
the
current
codification
of
the
first
sale
doctrine,
which
is
a
doctrine
that
goes
back
well
over
100
years
in
copyright
law,
section
109
says
that
if
someone
is
the
owner
of
a
particular
copy
that
was
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
that
that
owner
can
sell
or
otherwise
dispose
of
that
copy.
and
we
believe
that
that
is
about
as
broad
language
as
congress
could
use
and
in
fact
follows
a...
quite
a
lengthy
history
of
broad
language
in
the
statutes,
the
predecessor
statutes,
and
in
the
legislative
history,
all
of
which
have
made
clear
that
congress
intended
to
say
that
once
a
particular
copy
that's
lawfully
made
under
the
u.s.
copyright
law
has
been
sold,
the
copyright
owner's
rights
cease,
and
that's
the
actual
language
in
the
legislative
history
of
the
'76
act.
the
rights
cease,
of
the
u.s.
copyright
owner,
as
to
that
particular
copy.
we
think
that
the
first
sale
doctrine,
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
of
the
statute
that
suggests
that
the
first
sale
doctrine
was
being
overridden,
or
that
congress
intended
to
change
it,
there's
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
where
congress
was
talking
about
changing
the
first
sale
doctrine,
and
we
think
the
more
natural
reading
of
all
of
these
sections
together,
including
section
501,
the
more
natural
reading,
to
try
to
follow
the
congressional
intent,
not
the
policy
arguments
that
each
side
can
make,
not
the
positions
that
the
executive
branch
might
wish
to
take
as
a
matter
of
policy
or
as
a
matter
of
bilateral
negotiations,
we
think
that
the
fairer
way
to
read
the
actual
language
of
congress
is
the
way
we've
set
forth.
the
treaties...
excuse
me.
they're
not
treaties,
actually.
they're
bilateral
agreements
that
the
government
has
cited.
they
represent
positions
that
the
executive
branch
has
taken.
i
might
add
that
they've
taken
that
position
in
multilateral
negotiations
and
the
international
community
has
so
far
rejected
them,
but
trinidad
and
tobago
and
several
other
countries,
and
you
have
the
lodgings
in
front
of
you,
have
agreed
to
the
u.s.
position.
however,
there
is
no
liability
on
the
part
of
the
united
states
if
the
u.s.
position
is
wrong.
if
there's
a
violation
of
those
agreements,
there
is
an
obligation
for
consultation.
there
is
no
arbitration,
there
is
no
financial
liability,
and
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
if
the
executive
branch
wishes
to
curtail
parallel
imports
beyond
the
language
of
existing
statutes,
then
if
they
wish
to
rely
on
copyright
law
or
any
other
congressional
enactment,
they
should
go
to
congress.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
the
602
exceptions,
justice
stevens,
we
believe
apply
on
their
terms
to
very
limited
situations
where
people
are
importing
or
bringing
property
in
for
personal
use
or
for
noncommercial
use.
each
of
the
exceptions,
library
use,
government
use,
do
not
apply
to
commercial
distributions,
and
they
apply
generally
to
very
limited
numbers.
in
other
words,
you
can
bring
in
one
copy
or
bring
in
a
copy
in
your
baggage.
we
think
those
are
very
different
situations
from
the
first
sale
doctrine
that
deals
with
sales.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
justice
stevens,
they
are
not
because
the
language
of
the
602
exceptions
is
not
limited
to
copies
that
are
lawfully
made
under
this
title.
in
other
words,
one
of
the
paradigm
situations
that
the
copyright
considerations
were
looking
at
was
where
property
is
copyrighted
under
a
foreign
copyright,
and
this
happens
very
frequently.
this
is
a
quite
common
situation,
and
it
was
discussed
at
length
in
the
deliberations
leading
up
to
the
statute.
if
an
author
gives
the
british
copyright
to
his
or
her
book
to
a
british
company,
and
the
u.s.
copyright
to
his
or
her
book
to
a
u.s.
copyright
holder,
the
u.s.
copyright
holder
obviously
wishes
to
avoid
having
the
unrelated
british
copyright
holder
ship
1,000
copies
of
the
book
here
because
the
u.s.
copyright
holder
has
no
control
over
the
independent
entity,
has
not
been
paid
anything
for
those
copies,
et
cetera.
that
was
discussed
in
the
deliberations
leading
up
to
the
statute,
and
the
phrase
in
109,
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
we
submit
means
copies
that
are
made
under
the
u.s.
copyright
law
or
made
with
the
authorization
of
the
u.s.
copyright
holder,
whereas,
justice
stevens,
under
602,
if
i'm
traveling
in
britain,
and
i
pick
up
a
copy
of
a
british
book
that's
been
british-copyrighted
and
i
put
it
in
my
baggage,
i
can
come
home
with
it.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
yes,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
that's
correct.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
we
agree
with
that,
and
we
think
that
is
a
very
significant
distinction
between
the
two
statutes.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
as...
not
as
we
interpret
the
statute,
although
this
has
not
been
addressed
in
any
of
the
decisions
that
i'm
aware
of
precisely.
but
the
lawfully-made-under-this-title
language
of
the
first
sale
doctrine
in
109,
the
government
agrees
with
us
on
this
point
that
that
means
it's
made
with
the
authorization
of
the
u.s.
copyright
holder,
in
other
words,
made
under
u.s.
copyright
law.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
that's
correct.
it's
quite
common
for
property--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--that
is
our
understanding,
and
that
is
exactly
the
parallel
or
analogue
to
what
this
court
held
in
the
k
mart
case,
which
obviously
arose
under
customs
laws
and
trademark
law,
but
in
k
mart
the
solicitor
general
then
argued
that
the
first
sale
doctrine
in
the
trademark
law
should
protect
a
u.s.
mark
holder
from
competition
from
a
totally
unrelated
entity,
such
as
the
kind
we're
talking
about
now,
but
should
not
protect
the
u.s.
mark
holder
if
the
u.s.
mark
holder
is
a
parent
or
a
subsidiary
of
the
foreign
mark
holder.
that
was
the
position
the
government
took
then,
and
this
court
was
unanimous...
while
it...
the
court
split
on
several
other
of
the
various
alternative
cases
dealt
with
in
k
mart,
the
case
1
and
the
case
2a
situations
that
i've
just
referred
to,
the
court
was
unanimous
on
that.
the
position
we
are
taking
is
exactly
the
same
under
copyright
law
as
this
court
found
congress
had
authorized
under
the
trademark
law,
and
we
think
it
makes
good
sense
in
terms
of
the
interests
that
are
at
stake
and,
most
importantly,
it
follows
the
language
of
the
statute.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
we
do
not
believe
that
602
limits
the
question
of
where
you
manufacture,
and
there's
a
bmg
decision
from
the
ninth
circuit
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
that
seems
to
say
the
opposite,
but
that
decision's
been
criticized
by
a
number
of
other
courts,
including
the
ninth
circuit
in
a
later
case.
we
don't
think
the
language
of
congress
makes
anything
turn
specifically
on
where
you
manufacture.
now,
to
fully
answer
your
question,
justice
souter,
there
could
well
be
contractual
limitations.
if
the
author
divided
up
the
worldwide
rights
in
a
certain
way,
where
it's
manufactured--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
think
that's
correct,
but
i...
i'm
not
certain.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
think
that's
correct,
justice
breyer.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
there
could...
there
are
cases
i
think
where
there
could
be
some
overlap
between
the
109
protection
and
602,
but
there
are
a
great
number
of
cases
where
there's
not
overlap.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
correct.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
if
they
don't
own
them--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--if
they
don't
own
them,
there
might
not...
there
wouldn't
be
a
first
sale
doctrine.
you
actually...
you
don't
have
to
have
bought
them,
i
believe.
it
could
have
been
a
gift
or
other
situation.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
there
also
could
be
situations
where
the
property
wasn't...
was
made
under
u.s.
law
or
wasn't
made
under
u.s.
law.
there
could
be
cases
where
the
traveler
took
it
with
him
or
her
when
they
went
abroad
and
then
brought
it
back.
so
there
are
a
variety
of
hypotheticals.
i
agree
with
you
they're
not
totally
separate.
the
two
statutes
have
some
overlapping
situations,
i
agree.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well,
justice
ginsburg,
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
this
statute,
as
many
other
congressional
enactments,
probably
could
have
been
phrased
in
different
ways,
some
of
which
would
have
made
our
job
easier.
but,
for
example,
106a,
which
we
cite,
is
a
statute
that
specifically
says
that
that
provision
is
an
exception,
is...
that
the
first
sale
doctrine,
the
other
exceptions
don't
apply
to
that
one.
in
other
words,
in
106a
congress
made
it
very
clear
they
were
enacting
a
provision
that
wasn't
going
to
include
the
exceptions
in
106
that
we've
relied
on,
so
you
know,
we've
made
the
assertion
that
if...
that
congress
knows
how
to
make
it
clear
that
something
is
not
subject
to
the
exceptions.
they
did
it
in
106a.
i
think
you're
correct,
the
government
is
correct
that
there
are
other
ways
that
congress
could
have
phrased
several
of
these
provisions
that
probably
would
have
made
them
a
little
bit
clearer,
but
i
don't
think
there's
anything
in
the
sections
that
you
just
cited,
justice
ginsburg,
that's
inconsistent
with
our
position.
they
simply
made
that
section
a
little
clearer
than
they
made
602
and
106.
i
think
it's
undisputed
by
everyone
that
there
is
no
specific
reference
in
the
legislative
history
to
the
interplay
between
106...
i'm
sorry,
between
602
and
109.
in
other
words,
no
congress
member
ever
addressed
how
these
two
should
go
together.
we
believe
that
the
best
way
to
deal
with
that,
given
the
language
that's
in
the
statutes
at
issue
here,
the
most
relevant
statutes,
602
and
109,
is
to
say
congress
just
hasn't
addressed
the
matter.
congress
obviously
is
free
to
address
it,
and
the
government
can
either
submit
the
bilateral
agreements
that
it's
negotiated
to
congress
for
review,
or
it
can
go
in
with
a
statute
on
parallel
imports.
there
actually
have
been
quite
a
number
of
proposed
bills
to
curtail
parallel
imports.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
i
think
the
predecessor
statute
only
applied
to
pirated
goods,
justice
kennedy,
and
the
government
and
the
respondent
have
both
made
the...
have
both
referred
to
the
fact
that
the
new
statute
in
'76
was
clearly
intended
to
cover
more
than
just
pirated
goods,
but
so-called
lawfully
made
goods
as
well.
we
agree
with
that,
and
that's
exactly
the
case
that
i
referred
to
that's
analogous
to
the
k
mart
situation.
in
other
words,
goods
that
are
lawfully
made
under
foreign
copyright
laws
but
not
under
the
u.s.
law
we
think
are
covered
by
602,
and
the
fact
that
109
is
limited
to
lawfully
made
goods
under
this
title
we
think
draws
the
line
between
goods
made
under
u.s.
copyright
law
and
goods
made
under
foreign
copyright
law,
and
we've
laid
out
in
our
brief
quite
a
number
of
situations
where
the
new
602
does
have
meaning,
because
it
applies,
for
example,
in
the
case
where
an
unrelated
foreign
copyright
holder
has
produced
the
good,
it
applies
to
many
other
cases.
basically,
our
position
is
that
109
applies
in
the
importation
situation
just
as
it
applies
to
all
other
aspects
of
the
distribution
right,
and
109
limits
the
distribution
right
to
some
extent,
and
we
think
the
importation
rules
in
602
have
become
part
of
the
distribution
right,
and
109
applies
to
those
as
well.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
no.
i
do
not
believe
it
is
literally
a
form
of
distribution.
if
it
were,
there
would
be
no
need
for
the
602
statute.
but
congress,
we
believe,
intended
to
subsume
602
within
the
distribution
right.
we
think
that's
what
it
meant
by
saying
that
an
unauthorized
importation
is
a
violation
of
the
right
under
106,
that
congress
was
simply
declaring
it
to
be
a...
for
legal
purposes
a
form
of
distribution,
even
though
linguistically
it
may
not
be
precisely
that.
if
i
may,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
wallace
said
at
one
point
that
we
are
"talking
here
about
interpreting
an
act
of
congress.
"
we
agree
with
that,
and
we
think
that's
the
key
issue
before
the
court,
and
in
our
view
the
position
of
the
u.s.
government
in
bilateral
negotiations
or
bilateral
agreements
doesn't
by
itself
change
what
congress
intended.
and
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
that
in
one
of
the
lodgings
that
the
solicitor
general
has
provided
the
court
is
a
1990
telegram
that
includes
the
government's
legal
position
and
argument
before
most
of
these
bilateral
agreements
were
negotiated.
in
that
memorandum
the
government
lawyer
cites
the
sebastian
decision
from
the
third
circuit,
which
was
at
the
time
the
only
court
of
appeals
decision
on
this
issue
anywhere.
the
government
was
aware
that
the
law,
as
set
forth
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
contrary
to
their
position.
we
believe
they
could
have
come
to
congress
for
a
clarifying
change.
they
still
can.
there
is
no
reason
why
the
government
can't
ask
congress
to
change
the
law,
but
we
believe
there
has
been
nothing
cited
today
or
otherwise
that
suggests
that
congress
in
the
copyright
statute
was
making
the
kind
of
broad,
antiparallel
imports
rule
that
the
congress...
that
the
respondents
and
their
amici
are
now
suggesting.
all
of
the
amici
for
respondents,
including
the
solicitor
general,
have
been
really
quite
candid
in
saying
that
a
big
part
of
what's
at
issue
here
is
that
many
manufacturers
do
charge
more
for
u.s.
made
goods
in
the
united
states
than
those
u.s.
manufacturers
charge
for
the
same
u.s.
made
goods
in
foreign
countries.
the
solicitor
general
has
argued
that
somehow
that's
good
for
our
economy.
that's
a
policy
argument
we
don't
agree
with,
but
we
do
not
think
that
that
is
an
issue
for
this
court
to
decide
or
for
us
to
opine
on.
if
the
congress
wishes
for
u.s.
consumers
to
pay
more
for
u.s.
goods
than
foreign
consumers,
that
is
a
legitimate
issue
for
congress
to
deal
with
as
a
matter
of
policy,
parallel
import--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--i
will
accept
that,
justice
scalia,
although
i
don't
agree
with
the
ultimate
decision.
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
well--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--they
do
say
that,
justice
ginsburg.
i
would
point
out
that,
in
the
recording
industry
amicus
brief
that
they
filed
here,
they
pointed
out
that
videotapes
cost
as
much
as
six
times
more
in
the
united
states
than
the
same
u.s.
videotape
is
sold
for
in
certain
foreign
countries.
i
don't
think
anyone
contends
that
the
marketing
cost
is
600
percent
of
the
price.
the
government
has
been
quite
candid
in
saying
that
they
believe
there
are
certain
foreign
policy
values
in
promoting
underdeveloped
countries,
some
other
economic
issues.
there
may
be
antitrust
issues
at
stake.
whatever
those
considerations
are,
we
don't
think
in
the
copyright
law
congress
addressed
them,
and
while
i
agree,
justice
stevens,
that
copyrights
can
apply
to
labels
sometimes,
i
think
the
tail
is
wagging
the
dog
here,
and
that
congress
certainly
didn't
intend
the
result
that's
at
issue
here.
we
would
also
point
out
that
the
respondent--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--there
might
be
some
issues
of
tampering
with
goods
if
we
were
to
take
off
the
label
of
someone
else's
product,
but
i'm
not
prepared
to
say
what
the
state
law
issues
there
are.
certainly,
the
copyright
law
itself
wouldn't,
i
think,
address
that,
i
agree,
but
there
may
be
some
other
tort
issues
that
might
come
into
play.
the
respondent
has
acknowledged
that
under
his
theory
the
fair
use
doctrine
of
section
107
doesn't
apply
to
imported
goods.
we
think
that
is
an
extremely
important
point,
because
the
logic
of
their
position
is
that
none
of
these
exceptions
apply,
including
fair
use.
when
the
owner
of
the
london
times
gives
authority
to
import
multiple
copies
of
the
london
times
to
sell
in
the
united
states,
under
the
respondent's
theory
the
owner
of
the
london
times
copyright
cannot
bring
in
his
own
newspaper
if
there
is
a
book
review
in
the
london
times
that
quotes
from
someone
else's
book
in
what
normally
would
be
considered
fair
use,
because
the
fair
use
doctrine
that
allows
scholarly
books,
treatises,
book
reviews
to
quote
someone
else's
work,
it
only
allows
that
under
107.
under
their
theory,
107
is
simply
inapplicable
to
imports.
it
would
be
a
quite
major
change
in
the
law
of
this
united
states.
we
think
their
entire
argument,
getting
rid
of
the
first
sale
doctrine,
also
is
a
major
change.
we
have
in
our
country--
mr.
allen
r.
snyder
--thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
