argument
first
this
morning
in

quality
king
distributors
v.
l'anza
research
international.
mr.
snyder.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
snyder.
mr.
goettsch,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
goettsch,
you
don't
question
the
contention
of
petitioners
that
there
is
no
need
to
give
any
deference
to
the
negotiation...
negotiating
position
of
the
united
states
in
trade
agreements?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
you
say
that
there
is
some...
i
thought
you
just
said
that
we
just
pay
attention
to
the
language
used
by
congress,
but
you're
saying,
though,
that
that
language
should
be
interpreted
through
the
prism
of
the
executive
branch
deference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
has
no
duties
under
this
section,
does
it?
i
mean,
it
doesn't
administer
this
act.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
goettsch.
i
think
you've
answered
the
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
it
your
position
that
in
construing
the
statutory
language
we
should
give
some
sort
of
deference
to
the
position
that
our
government
has
taken
in
negotiating
with
trinidad
and
tobago?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
there's
no
deference,
why...
i'm
sure
we're
entitled
to
be
informed
about
it,
but
why
do
you
take
up
your
time
informing
us
about
it?
[laughter]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
sentence
that
you
didn't
quote?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
mr.
wallace,

records

that
this

w.
davis,

behalf
of
the
court
