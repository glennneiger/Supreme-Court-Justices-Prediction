justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
snyder,
the
government
has
come
in
and
urged
us
to
rely
on
the
section
that...
602,
dealing
with
infringing
importation
of
goods,
and
they
tell
us
that
the
united
states
has
entered
into
treaties
on
the
assumption
that
that
provision
governs.
what
do
we
do
with
that
argument
made
by
the
government?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
i
think
so,
but
i
would
be
very
interested
to
know
how
you
evaluate
the
extent
to
which
this
country
has
relied
on
some
other
interpretation,
as
the
government
argues.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
owe
deference
to
any
government
agency
in
interpreting
these
laws
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
you
one
more
question,
since
i
have
you
interrupted,
and
then
i'll
leave
it
alone.
section
501,
dealing
with
infringement
of
copyright,
says
anyone
who
violates
any
of
the
exclusive
rights
of
the
copyright
owner
covered
by
sections
106
through
118,
or
who
imports
copies
into
the
united
states
in
violation
of
section
602,
is
an
infringer.
under
your
theory,
that
section
wouldn't
be
needed,
i
suppose,
insofar
as
it
refers
to
section
602.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
or,
if
you're
traveling
in
some
other
country
and
you
pick
up
a
totally
unauthorized
copy
of
a
phonograph,
a
cd
or
some...
or
a
book,
totally
unauthorized,
you'd
be
protected
as
a
traveler
if
you
bought
it
and
brought
it
back
in--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--under
the
602
exceptions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
would
not
be
protected
under
106,
presumably.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
to
prevail,
do
we
have
to
think
that
importation
is
a
form
of
distribution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but,
of
course,
the
argument
on
the
other
side
is,
there's
no
infringement,
obviously,
if
there's
been
a
first
sale,
because
109
applies.
i
mean,
that's
the
argument,
and
i
don't...
it's
kind
of
odd
that
you're
here
arguing,
all
you
have
to
do
is
look
at
the
statute,
it's
so
clear.
the
other
side
is
saying
the
same
thing.
frankly,
i
think
the
other
side
has
the
better
argument
on
looking
at
the
statute
and
seeing
what
it
means,
so
i'm
concerned
about
what,
if
any,
deference
is
owed
to
anybody
here.
what
about
the
government's
position
on
these
bilateral
trade
agreements?
how
much
does
that
concern
us?
is
this
something
congress
can
fix,
if
they're
worried
about
it?
is
it
not
odd
that
we
would
find
in
the
middle
of
the
copyright
statute
some
effort
to
control
importation
of
some
kind
of
goods?
i
mean,
it
just
doesn't
fit
comfortably
under
the
copyright
law,
does
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
of
course,
that
gets
us
to
the
issue.
may
i
ask
this,
do
you
agree
that
there
was
a
distinction
which...
and
again,
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
this
by
any
means,
but
is
there
a
distinction
between
piratical
goods
on
the
one
hand
and
goods
lawfully
manufactured
pursuant
to
a
british
licensee
of
an
american
author?
isn't
it...
he
relies
heavily
on
that
distinction.
is
there
such
a
distinction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
you
want
us
to
be
reading?
what
brief,
and
what
page?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
you're
referring
us
to
something
else.
where
do
we
find
the
something
else?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
about
the
personal
right
of
a
traveler
in
their
baggage.
you
can
bring
in
anything,
piratical
or
otherwise,
if
it's
in
your
luggage.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
602(a)
now
has
a
specific
little
provision
for
somebody
arriving
at
customs
with
an
illicit
book--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
their
baggage.
