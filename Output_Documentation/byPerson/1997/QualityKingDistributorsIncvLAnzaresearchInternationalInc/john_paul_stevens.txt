mr.
snyder,
can
i
ask
you
another
question.
i
haven't
quite
figured
out
the
answer.
if
your
position
is
correct,
what
is
the
function
of
the
three
exceptions
to
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
those
exceptions
already
be
protected
by
the
first
sale
doctrine
if
it
applied?
that's
what
i'm
not
quite
clear.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
i'll
reveal
my
ignorance
about
that.
i
just
want
to
be
sure
i
understand.
in
other
words,
if
the
author
gave
the
british
copyrights
to
a
separate
company
from
the
publisher,
the
american
publisher,
the
british
company
then
sells
to
some
person
in
britain,
abroad,
a
bunch
of
copies,
those
are
not
protected
by
the
first
sale
doctrine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
u.s.
copyright...
oh,
i
see.
the
u.s.
copyright
holder
could
be
a
licensee
of
the
author,
and
you
have
a
different
copyright
holder
who's
also
a
licensee
in
britain.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
british
copies
would
not
be
lawfully
made
under
this
title,
within
the
meaning
of
109,
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
since
you've
cited
the
sony
case,
which
dealt
in
part
with
fair
use,
how,
under
your
reading
of
the
statute,
does
the
fair
use
doctrine
protect
the
importation
of
foreign-made
goods?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
so
your
view
is
there
is
no
fair
use
defense
in
this...
for
imported
goods.
justice
john
paul
stevens
will
you...
just
concentrating
on
the
language
for
a
minute,
will
you
explain
how
you
get
out
of
the
box
that
the
right
that's
been
infringed
is
the
exclusive
right
to
distribute
copies
under
section
106,
a
right
which
is
otherwise
qualified
as
a
first
sale
doctrine,
fair
use
doctrine
and
others.
why,
if
it's
the
right
granted
by
106,
why
isn't
that
right
qualified
by
the
other
provisions
between
107
and
119?
i
don't
quite
understand
your
answer
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand.
as...
you're
saying...
i
understand
that
argument,
but
initially,
if
it's
just
the
106
right,
which
has
already
been
curtailed
by
the
first
sale
doctrine,
how
can
you
say
it's
more...
i
don't
understand.
you
say
the
106
right
has
two
different
scopes,
one
for
most
infringement
cases,
and
then
a
broader
right
under
602(a),
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
subject
to
107
through
120,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
importation
right
is
treated
as
though
it
were
an
infringing
sale,
and
to
be
an
infringing
sale,
it
has
to
get
by
all
the
things
like
the
fair
use
doctrine,
the
first
sale
doctrine,
and
so
forth.
maybe
i
just
don't
quite--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
say
that
the
piratical
goods
encompass
lawfully
made
goods
pursuant
to
a
license
from
the
original
author--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--in
the
other...
the
british
copyright.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask...
just
to
comment
very
briefly
on
one
aspect
of
the
case
that
i
just
can't
quite
get
out
of
my
head,
it's
easy
to
follow
the
arguments
when
you're
talking
about
books
and
records
and
so
forth,
but
when
you're
talking
about
the
label
on
a
product
that
is
not
itself
patented
or
copyrighted,
the
label
is
controlling
the
distribution
of
the
product,
is
that
relevant
at
all
in
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
a
label.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
yet
it's
the
most
important
part
of
the
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
right
there,
mr.
wallace...
it's
quite
important
to
me...
did
that
section
cover
copies
made
pursuant
to
the...
an
authorized
british
copyright?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you're
answer
is
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
his
response
to
the
argument
you're
developing
as
well,
this...
the
big
change
in
this
statute
was,
it
covers
that
universe.
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
by
the
british
copyright,
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
have
permitted
those.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
want
to
be
sure
we
understand
what
it
does
apply
to.
there
are
three
categories
of
goods,
piratical
goods,
stuff
made
pursuant
to
the
british
copyright,
and
stuff
made
pursuant
to
the
american
copyright.
it
picks
up
the
middle
category.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
agree
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
a
substantial
reduction
of
copyrighted
goods,
pursuant
to
copyrights
in
trinidad
and
these
other
countries,
that
these
agreements
are
made
with?
tobago...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
not
piratical
copies,
legitimate
copies
made
under
a
different
copyright,
under
a
different
licensee.
that's...
he
says
that
takes
care
of
the
british
copyright
situation.
i
don't
think
you've
responded
to
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
keep
referring
to
piratical.
