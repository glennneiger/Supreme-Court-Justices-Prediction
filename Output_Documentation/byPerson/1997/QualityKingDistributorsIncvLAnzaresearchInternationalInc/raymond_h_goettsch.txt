mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
important
at
the
outset
to
note
that
we
believe
that
the
k
mart
v.
cartier
case
is
not
apposite
to
this
case
at
all.
in
that
case,
the
court
addressed
section
526
of
the
tariff
act
of
1930,
and
under
section
526,
a
u.s.
entity
can
record
its
u.s.
trademark
with
the
customs
service
to
prevent
unauthorized
importation
of
goods,
even
those
with
a
genuine
trademark.
the
protection,
however,
extends
only
to
goods
of
foreign
manufacture,
and
the
issue
before
the
court
was
whether
the
customs
service's
regulations
were
based
upon
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
that
statute,
and
a
majority
of
the
court
found
the
phrase,
foreign
manufacture,
to
be
ambiguous
and
then
as
a
result
found
that
some
of
the
regulations
of
the
customs
service
were
reasonable.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
k
mart
case
dealt
with
trademark
law,
it's
important
to
remember
that,
as
this
court
recognized
in
the
sony
v.
universal
studios
case,
the...
there's
a
difference
between
the
scope
and
scheme
and
purpose
of
the
trademark
law
as
opposed
to
the
copyright
law,
and
the
courts
are
not
to
take
principles
or
doctrines
from
trademark
law
and
extend
them
to
copyright
law.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
well,
i
think
that
in
enacting
section
602(a)
congress
made
a
decision
that
the
limitations
under
chapter
1
of
the
copyright
act,
which
would
include
the
fair
use
under
section
107
as
well
as
the
first
sale
defense
under
section
109(a),
did
not
apply
to
section
602(a).
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
yes,
except
to
the
extent
that
we
think
that
the
three
exceptions
that
congress
did
set
out
expressly
to
section
602(a)
do
have
a
fair
use
element
to
them.
the
question,
of
course,
before
this
court
is
whether
section
109(a)
of
the
copyright
act
is
a
defense
to
copyright
infringement
under
section
602(a)
for
unauthorized
importation
of
copies
acquired
outside
the
united
states.
the
answer
to
this
question
should
be
purely
a
product
of
statutory
interpretation.
prior
to
the
enactment--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well,
i
don't...
no,
we
do
not
agree
with
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that.
what
i'm
saying
is
that...
first
of
all,
i
don't
think
that
the
court
needs
to
reach
that
issue
to
interpret
this
statute.
i
think
the
statute
is
unambiguous
on
its
face.
however,
if
the
court
were
to
consider
legislative
intent,
since
the
copyright
office
was
very
much
involved
in
the
writing
of
the
1976
copyright
act,
then
i
would
simply
say
that
its
interpretation
of
that
act
corroborates--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--no.
unlike
602(b),
where
customs
is
required
to
prohibit
or
bar
the
import
of
piratical
copies,
under
section
602(a)
it's
up
to
the
copyright
holder
to
enforce
the
bar
to
entry
of
unauthorized
importation.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
well,
that
could
be.
the--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well,
i
think
what
i
meant
by
deference,
and
probably
my
choice
of
words
was
not
particularly
apt,
what
i
meant
was
that
if
the
court
is
going
to
look
at
legislative
intent,
which
i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
do,
that
the
copyright
office's
role
in
the
writing
of
the
statute
is
corroborated...
is
evidence
of
intent,
and
its
current
interpretation
corroborates
the
legislative
intent.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
not
in
that
sense,
just
in
the
sense
that
this
is
corroborative
evidence
of
legislative
intent
if
the
court
needs
to
reach
that.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
well,
there
are
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
if
section
109(a),
the
first
sale
defense,
applied
to
section
602(a),
then
the
three
exceptions
that
congress
expressly
identified--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well,
section
106,
subparagraph
(3),
which
provides
for
the
copyright
holder--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--right,
but
that
gives
the
copyright
holder
the
right
to
control
the
exclusive
distribution
of
a
copy,
is
not
exhausted
unless
there
is
a
sale,
and
importation
does
not
denote
a
sale,
so
the
distribution
right
under
section
106
is
complementary
but
separate
from
the
importation
right
under
section
602(a).
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
no,
i
don't
think
it
is
justice
stevens,
i
don't
think
it
is
treated
as
an
infringing
sale.
the
importation,
the
act
of
unauthorized
importation
of
copies
acquired
outside
of
the
united
states
itself
is
copyright
infringement,
as
recognized
separately
in
section
501(a)
of
the
act.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
well,
i
don't
agree,
justice
o'connor,
because
prior
to
the
enactment
of
the
1976
copyright
act
section
602
prohibited
the
importation
of
piratical
goods,
meaning
unauthorized
copies,
and
congress...
by
enacting
section
602(a),
congress
intended
to
extend
that
protection
to
the
copyright
holder
beyond
piratical
goods
to
the
unauthorized
importation
of
authentic
copies.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
well--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--justice
stevens,
if
you're
asking,
prior
to
the
enactment
of
section
602(a)
was
the
provision
with
respect
to
piratical
goods
applicable
to
that
situation,
then
i
think
it
was.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
well,
it
wasn't...
there
was
no
case
law
that
expressly
said
that,
and
i
think
that
congress,
by
enacting
section
602(a),
wanted
to
make
it
very
clear
that
the
unauthorized
importation
of
authentic
copies
was
copyright
infringement.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
well--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well,
of
course--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well,
because
the
first
sale
is
intended
to
reflect
the
fact
that
the
copyright
holder
has
exhausted
its
exclusive
distribution
right
and
has
received
the
full
value
of
its
copyright,
and
a
sale
abroad,
a
sale
outside
the
united
states,
since
the
copyright
act
operates
territorially,
the
sale
outside
of
the
united
states
does
not
exhaust--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
which
is
true
in
many
situations
where
copyright
holders
sell
the
copyright
goods
abroad,
they're
sold
at
a
discount,
a
significant
discount.
if
those
copies
are
allowed
to
come
back
into
the
united
states
and
compete
with
the
copies--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well,
the
concern
is
that
if
the
copies
acquired
outside
the
united
states
at
a
discount
come
back
into
this
country,
then
they
compete
with
the
copyright
holders--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--no--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--well,
if
the
sale
were
in
the
united
states,
then
the
copyright
holder
would
have
exhausted
the
right
under
106(3)
to
control
the
exclusive
distribution,
and
then
section
109(a)
would
apply,
but
if
the
sale
is
outside
of
the
united
states,
then
the
right
to
control
distribution
has
not
been
exhausted.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
no,
because
the
copyright
act
does
not
recognize
classes
of
copyrights.
there's
no
first
class
copyright
for
a
book
or
play
and
a
second
class
copyright
for--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--a
product
label
or
a
product
design.
if--
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
--thank
you.
mr.
raymond
h.
goettsch
yes.
