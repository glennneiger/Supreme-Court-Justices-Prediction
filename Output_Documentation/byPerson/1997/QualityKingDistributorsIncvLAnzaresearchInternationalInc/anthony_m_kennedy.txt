justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
what
is
your
response
to
the
argument...
i
recall
it
was
part
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion...
that
the
predecessor
of
602
was
worded
in
a
way
which
would
cover
many
of
the
examples
you
gave,
and
yet
they
added
the
terms,
acquired
outside
the
united
states,
so
it
seems
that
your
arguments
give
very
little
weight
or
significance
to
the
changes
between
the
two...
between
the
predecessor
statute
and
602
as
now
written.

mr.
wallace,
i've
been
reading
subsection
(b)
and
i'm
curious,
could
you
just
help
me
with
the
second
sentence?
the
first
sentence,
the
one
you
pointed
to,
repeats
the
prohibition
against
pirated...
piratical
works.
the
second
sentence
says,
in
a
case
where
copies
were
lawfully
made
the
customs
service
has
no
authority
to
prevent
their
importation
unless
the
provisions
of
601
are
applicable,
and
601
has
to
do
with
english
literary
works
or
something.
what
do
i
do
with--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--why
doesn't
the
second
sentence
describe
this
case?
