justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
court
hasn't
said
that,
certainly.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
court
has
never
said
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
fact
it
is
quite
extraordinary
that
a
court
would
take
this
rather
simple
language
and
derive
some
other
meaning
from
it,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
we
have
plenty
of
cases
from
this
court
precedent
saying
the
first
thing
we
do
is
look
at
the
language
of
the
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
didn't
say
that.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
said
it's
not
appropriate
to
charge
a
section
1001
violation
where
a
suspect
during
an
investigation
merely
denies
his
guilt
in
response
to
questioning
by
the
government.
i
had
read
that
as
not
saying
the
statute
is
inapplicable,
but
as
a
policy
matter
the
government...
the
justice
department
didn't
want
them
to
charge
it.
now,
is
that
how
you
read
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yet
it
was
charged
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you...
can
you
tell
us
how
often
it
is
used,
and
that
charges
are
brought?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
the
government
in
this
case,
and
reject
the
doctrine,
is
it
likely
that
the
justice
department
would
alter
its
guidelines?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
presumably
you
have
some
voice
in
what
goes
on
over
there.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
it
now
says
what
on
the
cdrom?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
under
your
view,
i
take
it
that
an
average
motorist
who
is
driving
down
the
street,
comes
to
a
stop
sign,
makes
a
rolling
california
stop--
[laughter]
the
police
officer
is
parked
on
the
corner
behind
a
bush
and
comes
around
with
the
red
light,
stops
the
motorist,
says,
sir,
did
you
stop
at
that
stop
sign
back
there
on
the
corner?
yes,
says
the
motorist,
yes,
i
did.
now,
the
officer
can
charge
him
with
a
felony
under
1001.
all
the
elements
are
there,
i
assume.
material?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
