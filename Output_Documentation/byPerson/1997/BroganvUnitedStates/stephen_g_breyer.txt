justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--could
i
ask
you
a
question,
please,
counsel?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if...
on
the
government's
interpretation,
what
is
the
most
abusive,
unfair,
or
otherwise
improper
result
that
you
could
conceive
of,
because
you've
several
times
said
it
would
produce
unfair
results.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
or
could
be
used
abusively,
and--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
it...
i
mean,
one...
i...
well,
i
don't
see...
assuming
i
don't
think
it's
terrible
to
make
it
a
separate
crime
to
lie
to
somebody
about
what
you've
done
before--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--but
what...
i'm
not...
what
is
your...
in
your
view--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--what
is
the
most
abusive,
unfair,
or
inappropriate
result?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
they'll
say
it's
because
he
committed
a
new
crime.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
know
you
want
to
get
back
to
that,
but
i
do
want
to
be
certain
i
have
in
my
mind
a
list
of
any
of
the
things
that
in
your
view
are
abusive
or
unfair
that
could
result
from
the
government's
interpretation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
no,
okay.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
that's
so,
then
let
me
go
back
to
where
i
think
is...
what
i
think
is...
at
least
convinced
me
is
the
strongest
argument
against
you,
which
i'm
not
saying
i'm
accepting.
but
what
about
a
perjury
case?
does
the
government
prosecute
perjury
where
all
that's
happened
is,
the
defendant's
taken
the
stand,
answered
every
question
truthfully
but
one.
the
one
was,
are
you
guilty
of
this
crime?
no.
does
the
government
prosecute
such
cases?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
i
think
perhaps
this
doctrine
of
the
exculpatory
no
arose
out
of
such
cases.
i'm
not
clear
as
to
precisely
what
the
history
of
the
doctrine
is,
but
i
think
it's
pretty
well
established,
and
i
think
it
arose
out
of
the
problem
of
prosecuting
a
person
for
precisely
that
kind
of
perjury,
you
know,
that...
in...
i
don't
think
it
happens.
i
just
don't
think
it
happens,
and
i
think
the
reason--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
this
was...
a
plea
of
not
guilty
would
not
fall
within
it.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
right.
all
right.
so...
but
now
let
me--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--i
agree.
now,
let
me
extrapolate
a
little.
once
you
accept
that,
like
most
statutes,
this
statute
won't
be
taken
with
complete
literalness.
then
the
next
part
of
the
argument,
i
take
it,
is,
let's
look
to
where
this
statute...
what
it
was
aimed
at.
it
was
aimed
at
procurement,
getting
money
from
the
government,
and
then
harold
ickes
said,
let's
extend
it
to
all
regulatory
programs,
and
then
no
one
thought
at
the
time,
apparently,
that
one
function
of
one
government
agency
is
to
investigate
crime,
and
therefore,
by
happenstance,
it
makes
every
statement
made
to
a
criminal
investigator
a
separate
crime.
i'm
not
saying
it
doesn't
do
that,
but
it
could
have
been
happenstance.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
that
being
so,
it
wouldn't
be
so
surprising
to
exempt
from
that
statute
which
makes
making
statements
not
under
oath
the
same
evil
as
making
perjury
under
oath,
under
amazingly
strict
conditions.
and
now
we
write
a
little
exception
into
that
statute
which
is
the
same
in
the
statute
as
the
fairly
wellknown
prosecutorial
exception
for
the
exculpatory
no
is
in
respect
to
perjury.
in
other
words,
carry
it
over,
all
done
sub
silentio,
without
a
word
in
the
statute.
now,
i
take
it
that
that's
what
the
courts
of
appeals
were
doing,
and
it
isn't
totally
without
support,
is
it?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
there
are
some
exceptions
implicitly.
there
are
some
exceptions
implicitly
in
every
statute.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
so
i
take
it
your
strongest
case
here
would
be
to
say,
take
the
prosecutorial
history
of
the
perjury
statutes,
note
the
problem
of
abuse
with
the
exculpatory
no
there,
and
sub
silentio
bring
it
in
here
in
a
statute
that
really,
just
by
happenstance,
covers
all
crimes
being
investigated
as
opposed
to
what
harold
ickes
thought.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
was
an
exception
in
the--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--there
was
an
exception
in
the
sentencing
guidelines
for
the
exculpatory
no
for
the
instance
where
the
person
gets
on
the
stand
and
might
otherwise
tell
a
long
story
that
would
subject
him
to
an
increase
in
the
punishment.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
there
were
also...
now,
i'm
not
saying
what
the
statute
is.
i'm
just
saying,
it's...
there
is
a
long
history,
it
seems
to
me,
of
exculpatory
no
that's
relevant
here.
it's
not
just
a
doctrine
that
was
made
up
by
six
courts
of
appeals.
