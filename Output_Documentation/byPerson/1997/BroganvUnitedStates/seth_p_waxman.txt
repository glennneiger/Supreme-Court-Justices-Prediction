mr.
seth
p.
waxman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court--
section
1001
makes
it
a
crime
for
anyone
knowingly
and
wilfully
to
make
any
materially
false
statements
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
agency.
that
language,
by
its
terms,
applies
to
mr.
brogan's
statements
to
investigative
agents
in
this
case.
whatever
policy
justifications
one
might
proffer
for
an
exculpatory
no
exception,
there
is
no
support
for
it
in
the
statute
or,
for
that
matter,
in
its
legislative
history.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
that's
a
pretty
broad
question,
and
i'll
try
and
give
as
many
answers
to
it
as
i
can.
as
to
why
it
hasn't
come
up
before
this
court
more
often,
i
think
one
reason
may
be
that
the
government
frequently,
in
exercising
its
prosecutorial
discretion
about
which
crimes
to
devote
its
prosecutorial
resources
to,
frequently
prosecutes,
tends
to
concentrate
its
resources
on
criminal
behavior
where
something
more
than
a
mere
exculpatory
no
was
involved.
but
even
in
cases
where
we
prosecute
a
mere
exculpatory
no...
for
example,
the
bryson
case
in
this
court,
the
woodward
case
in
this
court...
the
doctrine
of
exculpatory
no
is
so
obscure
and,
notwithstanding
the
representation
that
there
is
some
wall
of
authority
out
there
by
the
court
of
appeals
recognizing
it,
which
in
our
view
more
resembles
a
rubble
than
a
wall,
it
simply
is
not
a
doctrine
that
has
stood
as
a
major
impediment
to
the
kinds
of
prosecutions
that
the
government
chooses
to
bring.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
justice
scalia,
our
policy
statement
is
just
that.
it
is
not...
does
not
purport
to
be
an
interpretation
of
what
the
law
requires.
the
justice
department
has
never
taken
the
position
in
any
court
that
the
exculpatory
no
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--with
all
due
respect,
i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--no,
it--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--that
is
not
only
how
we
read
it,
but
it
is
what
we
appended
to
our
brief
in
reply
to
the
petition
for
certiorari
in
this
case,
and
the
language,
the
exact
language
is
found
at
page
4a.
now,
the
language
of
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
was
charged
here,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--our
experience,
and
i
think
this
is
reflected
in
pages
8
and
9
of
our
brief
at
the
petition
stage,
is
that
in
light
of
this
policy,
which
in
one
form
or
another
has
been
outstanding
for
several
decades,
there...
it
is
relatively
infrequent
for
the
government
to
charge
a
defendant
where
there
is
nothing
more
than
a
simple
exculpatory
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i...
i'm
not
in
charge
of
writing
the
guidelines.
i
would
suggest
that
the
answer
is
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
it
were
my
decision,
and
i
think
i
do
have
a
voice,
i
would
say
that
we
might
alter
the
language
of
the
guideline
a
little
bit.
i
don't
like
the
use
of
the
word
appropriate
in
the
guideline,
but
the
u.s.
attorney's
manual
is
full
of
policies
that
represent
just
that,
determinations
by
the
attorney
general
about
how
to
allocate
what
are,
after
all,
scarce
prosecutorial
resources.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
that
motivated
our
policy
was
that
in
the
broad
scheme...
realm
of
possible
federal
crimes
a
simple
exculpatory
no,
or
a
false
statement
to
an
agent,
is
not
up
in
the
pantheon,
along
with
many
of
the
other
things
that
we
have
to
deal
with,
but
another
reason--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--the
current
man...
the
manual
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
the
petition
was
filed
was...
is
reprinted
at
pages
3a
and
4a
of
our
brief
in
reply
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
the
manual
is
frequently
changed.
in
fact,
i
only
learned
last
week
that
in
the
new
updated
online
cdrom
version
of
the
manual,
which
came
out
2
weeks
ago,
there
in
fact
has
been
a
further
change
in
this
particular
provision,
in
that
it
deletes
the
words,
that
it
is,
and
the
word
appropriate.
now...
but
the
point
is
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
now
says
that
it's
the
department's
policy
to...
it
is
the
department's
policy
not
to
charge
a
section
1001
violation
where
a
suspect
during
an
investigation
merely
denies
his
guilt
in
response
to
questioning
by
the
government,
and
then
it
just
goes
on
as
it's
recited
on
page
4a.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
this
is
purely
an
instruction
to
our
prosecutors
in
the
field
about
how
to
allocate
prosecutorial
resources,
and
the
manual--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
first
of
all
i'm
not...
i
don't
want
to
suggest
that
an
exculpatory
no,
or,
just
to
take
it
out
of
the
jargon,
false
statements
knowingly
and
wilfully
given
to
investigative
agents
is
not
a
serious
crime
and,
in
fact,
in
certain
circumstances
it
may
be
a
very
serious
crime--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--depending
on
what
the
agents
are
doing,
but--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
here...
if
i
can
just
respond,
here
what
the
record
shows
is
not
that
the
agent,
or
the
agency,
or
the
prosecutor
had
determined
that
mr.
brogan
had
committed
a
crime.
the
agents
came
to
his
door,
and
this
is
reflected
in
the
relevant
pages
that
are
attached
in
the
joint
appendix,
came
to
his
door
and
said,
we
are
agents
of
the
internal
revenue
service
and
the
department
of
labor,
we're
investigating
possible
misconduct
with
respect
to
a
company
you
used
to
work
for
and
a
union,
may
we
come
in
and
talk
to
you.
if
you'...
he
said
yes.
they
said,
if
you
would
like
to
cooperate
with
us
you
should
get
an
attorney,
or
we'll
get
an
attorney
for
you
and
you
can
come
down
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office,
would
you
mind
if
we
ask
you
a
few
questions,
he
said
no,
and
they
didn't
ask
him,
are
you
guilty
of
bribery.
they
asked
him
whether
he'd
ever
received
any
money.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
it
may
be
about
things
other
than
an
allocation
of
resources,
and
i'll
address
that
in
a
moment,
but
it
is
not
about
prosecutorial
misconduct.
we
have--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
the
answer
to
your
first
question
is
no,
it's
not
about
prosecutorial
abuse
in
any
fashion.
now,
whether
the
government
could
prove
that
statement
as
a
false
statement
would
depend
on
our
being
able
to
establish
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--this
statute
could...
i
mean,
i
suppose
if
you
wanted
to
try
and
find
dangers,
it
could
escalate
completely
innocent
conduct
into
a
felony.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that's
correct,
and
one
of
the
reasons
why
a
lot
of--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--one
of
the
reasons
why
a
lot
of
policy
concerns
that
seem
to
revolve
around
the
exculpatory...
the
champions
of
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine
are
really
quite
irrelevant
to
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine
itself
and
why,
among
those
courts
of
appeals
that
at
one
time
or
another
have
adopted
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine
or
genuflected
in
the
direction
of
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine,
have
come
up
with
so
many
different
formulations
and
tests,
even
among
the
seven
circuits
that--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--oh,
sure.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
false
statements...
i'm
sorry,
by
the
agents--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
the
suspect?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
sure--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
it's
a
statement
that
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
the
statement
is
material--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
it's
made--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
it's
made
knowingly--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--if
it's
made
knowingly,
wilfully,
and
in
a
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
a
federal
agency,
and
it
is
material
to
the
matter
that
the
agency
is
investigating,
it's
an
offense.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
in
other
words--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i
don't
know
whether
a...
i
think
it
would
be
quite
arguable
whether
a
ruse
or
a
misrepresentation,
a
false
statement
by
an
undercover
agent,
could
ever
be
deemed
to
be
material
for
purposes
of
the
investigation.
in
other
words,
the
very
purpose
of
the
undercover
operation,
and
the
very
purpose
of
the
misrepresentation,
is
to
facilitate
the
investigation
that
the
agency
is
engaging
in.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
if
it
were
deemed
not
material,
but
i
mean,
i'm
confident
that
this
statute
can
be
and
has
been
applied
to
federal
agents
who
are
abusing
their
authority
and
making
knowing
and
wilful
material
misstatements
of
fact.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
i
mean,
we
prosecute
federal
agents
just
as
we
prosecute
people
who
aren't
federal
agents.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
that
is
true,
and
this
case,
of
course,
was
prosecuted
and
the
jury
was
instructed
after,
although
it
was
just
after
this
court
rendered
its
decision
in
gaudin.
the
jury
was
instructed
that
materiality
was
an
element
of
the
offense,
and...
you
know,
on
our
request,
and
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury
as
an
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it's
interesting,
at
the
time
that
this
court
decided
gaudin,
all
of
the
circuits,
except
coincidentally
the
second
circuit,
had
agreed
that
materiality
was
an
element
of
the
false
statement
prong
of
the
statute
as
it
had
previously
existed.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
the
word
material
does
appear
in
the
text
even
as
it
existed
at
the
time.
the
only
question
is--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
says,
whoever,
in
any
matter
within
the
jurisdiction
of
any
department
or
agency
of
the
united
states
knowingly
and
wilfully
falsifies,
conceals,
or
covers
up
by
any
trick,
scheme,
or
device
a
material
fact,
or
makes
any
false--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--and
the
question,
and
it
was
a
good
question--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
doesn't,
and
that's
why
there
was
a
question,
which
i
think
this
court
actually
didn't
resolve
in
gaudin,
as
to
whether
in
fact
materiality
was
an
element
of
the
next
phrase.
i
mean,
the
court
did
assume,
had
to
have
assumed
that
it
was
an
element,
because
it
found
that
in
a
false
statement
prosecution,
which
is
what
was
at
issue
in
gaudin,
the
jury
had
to
be
instructed
on
it,
but
as--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
was
the
government...
the
government
has
always
maintained
that
materiality
is
an
element...
although
it
appears
before
the
comma,
it
is
an
element
of
all
three,
probably
because
at
common
law,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
it
was
an
element
of
perjury,
but
i...
you
know,
even
if--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--absolutely,
and
the
lower
courts
are
uniformly
concluded
that.
the
reason
is
that
the
decisionmaker
for
purposes
of
the
materiality
test
articulated
in
kungis
and
gaudin
is
the
decisionmaking
agency,
it's
not
the
individual
agent,
and
the
cases
are
legion--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--we
think...
that's
far
from
this
case,
but
we
think
it
would.
even
if
the
agent
was
bound
and
determined
to
charge
mr.
brogan
with
receiving
improper
payments
under
the
labor
management
relations
act,
and
just
decided
to
swing
by
his
house
on
the
way
to
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
to
ask
for
an
indictment
to
be
returned,
and
asked
him
the
question
knowing
that
the
answer
would
be...
well,
i
mean,
knowing
that
he
had
done
it,
i
think
it
is
material.
it
may
very
well,
you
know,
alter
the
judgment
of
the
agency
itself
in
deciding
whether
to
recommend,
the
prosecutor
in
deciding
whether
this
is
a
case
that's
worth
prosecuting
and,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out
in
response
to
my
colleague's
questions,
his
response
to
that
question,
even
assuming
that
the
agent...
agents
in
this
case
believed
that
he
had
taken
bribes,
or
taken
payments
prohibited
by
the
labor
management
relations
act,
his
response,
no,
did...
was
capable
of
influencing,
and--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
it
wouldn't
be
a
false
statement
because
it's
not
responsive.
in
other
words,
we
have
to
prove...
there
is
the
literally
true
doctrine
that
this
court
recognized
in
bronsten,
and
presumably
a...
an
answer
which
amounts
to
a
non
sequitur
can't
be
prosecuted
as
a
false
statement.
we
have
to
prove
that
it
was
false,
and
that
it
was
knowingly
and
wilfully
so
when
he
said--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
assuming
that
the
officer
was
in
fact...
that
this
happened,
for
example,
on
the
gw
parkway,
within
the
jurisdiction--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--of
the
park
police,
you...
if
you
could
prove...
and
this,
i
think,
would
require
some
proof.
you
would
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
in
the
case
knew
that
he
or
she
did
not
come
to
a
complete
stop.
it
would
be
an--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--it
would
be
an
extraordinary,
i
would
submit,
abuse
of
the
government's
resources,
and
i'm
not
aware,
in
terms
of
these
parade
of
horribles--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--where
the
government
has
ever
actually
done
that.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
absolutely
not.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
we
don't
prosecute...
i'm
not
aware
that
the
government
has
ever
prosecuted--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i'm
only
aware
of
one
instance.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
one
decided
case.
it's
a
case
called
the
united
states
v.
endo,
i
think
in
the
fourth
circuit,
where
the
question
arose
whether
a
plea
of
not
guilty--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--but
the
question
you're
raising
is,
in
fact,
akin
to
it.
i
mean,
the
plea
of
not
guilty
is
the
means
by
which
our
adversarial
criminal
justice
system
uses--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
essentially
invoke
the
defendant's
right.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i
think...
i'm
not...
i
don't,
actually
don't
think
that
is
what
many
of
the
courts
of
appeals
were
doing,
and
i
think
it
is
totally
without
support.
if
you
say,
we
could
just
write
a
little
exception
in,
if
you're
referring
to
we,
congress--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--i--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
if
congress
wanted
to
create
an
exculpatory
no
exception
of
some
sort
limited
to...
i
mean,
a
guilty
plea
or
a
statement
i'm
not
guilty
is
not
really
a
statement
of
fact,
it's
a
statement
that
you
can't
prove
my
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
or
i
challenge
you
to--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--to
the
contrary.
we
not
only
prosecute
them
if
it's--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--in
grayson
and
dunnegin
this
court
has
upheld
the
government's
efforts
to
require
or
encourage
judges
to
consider
enhancement
of
sentences
if
perjury
was
established--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--even
if
perjury
is
not
charged.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth

--i
think
what's
interesting,
justice
breyer,
is,
if
you
look
at
the
perjury
cases
there
is
no
exculpatory
no
doctrine
under
the
perjury
statutes.
it's
not
something
that
has
arisen
under
the
perjury
statutes,
and
the
government
feels
perfectly
free,
where
it
can
prove
a
knowing,
false
statement
under
oath
in
a
judicial
matter,
and
it's
something
that
comes
within
1621
or
1623,
to
charge
it.
the--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--well,
i'm
happy,
personally
happy
to
see
that
the
word
is
gone,
but
in
any
event,
you
know,
it's
interesting,
your
pointing
out
a
distinction
that
is
between
a
false
denial
that's
deliberative,
as
opposed
to
one
that's
not
quite
deliberative.
that's
a
distinct...
the
various
courts
of
appeals
that
have
recognized
some
form
of
this
"doctrine"
have
come
up
with
an
amazing
number
of
distinctions,
but
to
my
knowledge
that's
not
one
of
them.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
that,
of
course,
is
not
the
law
in
almost
any
of
the
circuits
that
have
adopted
this
doctrine,
and
it's
also
one
that
would
be
totally
artificial.
i
mean,
what
will
we
do,
just
train
government
agents
to
ask
the
followup
question?
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well,
it's
what...
insofar
as
what
the
judge
allowed
into
the
record
it's
what
happened
in
this
case.
that
is
not
what
happened
in
this
case,
and
it's
also
why
this
prosecution
was
not
even
in
fact
inconsistent
with
this
policy,
but
the
judge
excluded
from
evidence
the
conversation
that
followed
the
socalled
"exculpatory
no"
in
this
case.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
there
is
not
a...
an
absolute,
a
priori
distinction,
but
there
is
a...
there...
the
following
distinction
does
exist.
the
latter
question
is
a
pure
question
of
fact.
the
former
question
is
a
mixed
question
of
fact
and
law,
and
in
order
for
the
government
to
convict
somebody
with
respect
to
a
false
no
in
response
to
the
former
question,
presumably
we
would
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
the
elements
of
the
crime
of
bribery.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
i
think
that
we
could
prosecute
it
if
we
could
carry
that
heavy
burden.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
yes.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
no,
and
it
would
be
an
incredible
waste
of
resources.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
well--
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
--absolutely
not.
i
mean,
this
court
so
held
in
yermian.
mr.
seth
p.
waxman
but
there...
i
mean,
in
response
to
your
point
about
abuse
with
respect
to
this
statute,
i
mean,
there...
if
there
are
unscrupulous
agents
and
unscrupulous
prosecutors,
there
are...
there
is
an
entire
volume,
title
18,
that
can
be
used
in
improper
fashions,
and
we
have
mechanisms
within
the
justice
department,
the
bar
has
mechanisms,
both
using
the
criminal
law
and
under
our
professional
ethics
standards
for
dealing
with
that.
this
is
a
statute
which
i
think
the
record
shows
has
been
applied
by
the
government
over
the
years
in
a
very
responsible
fashion.
i
mean,
the
fact
that,
notwithstanding
all
the
years
that
this
has
been
in
effect,
the
petitioner
is
not
able
to
come
up
with,
even
hypothetically,
let
alone
a
real
decided
case
in
which
the
government
has
abused
its
authority
speaks
volumes.
thank
you.
