justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
mr.
holtzman--
--well,
i
think
it
would
be
rather
an
extraordinary
proposition
for
this
court
to
say
that
when
you
see
a
uniformed
officer
we
have
a
preference
to
lying
than
to
say
nothing
at
all.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
that's
all
the
more
reason
for
him
to
tell
the
truth.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
yes,
but
that
was
in
the
context
of
rejecting
a
narrowing
construction,
much
of
the
kind
that
you're
offering
to
us
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
is
one
of
those
things
that
it
can
elevate
a
misdemeanor
into
a
felony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
mean,
if
i
tell
the
policeman
on
the
gw
parkway,
oh,
i
was
only
going
40,
i
guess
that's
a
felony
if
i
was
going
45,
so
i
get
the
ticket
plus
the
felony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
i
mean,
that's
a
danger
in
this
statute,
is
it
not,
that
it
can
escalate
a
misdemeanor
to
a
felony?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
of
course,
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine
wouldn't
solve
that
problem
on
the
gw
parkway.
i
mean,
you...
the
policeman
would
have
to
go
up
and
say,
were
you
going
over
40?
i
mean,
he
wouldn't
have
to
say,
you
were
going
over
40.
he
would
have
to
ask
the
question.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
well,
even
in
california
they
prove
that
all
the
time.
[laughter]
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
the
new
statute
excludes
that
anyway.
parties
to
judicial
proceedings
are
excluded
from
the
amended
statute.
general
waxman,
i
hope
you're
not
conceding
the
point
that
the
government
will
not
prosecute
even
a
criminal
defendant
who
chooses
to
take
the
stand
and
perjures
himself.
