justice
ruth
bader

mr.
holtzman,
may
i
clarify
what
your
point
is?
it's
not
that
you're
saying
it
isn't
a
false
statement.
are
you
saying
it
isn't...
it
can't
be
material?
is
that--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--so
if
it's
in
the
words,
makes
any
false
statement...
but
there's
materially
before
that,
so
i
was
supposing
maybe
that's
what
you
meant.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
make
any
false
statement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
still,
it's...
the
words
you're
dealing
with
is
any
false
statement.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
your
argument,
then,
is
based
on
legislative
history
that,
as
you
said,
no
is
a
false
statement,
and
nonetheless
it
doesn't
come
under
the
words,
any
false
statement
because?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
there
any
words
in
the
statute
that
you--
--well
now,
it
seems
to
me--
--i
mean,
do
you
put
any
weight
on
wilfully
or
knowingly
at
all,
or--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
are
you
relying
at
all,
mr.
holtzman,
on
what
might
have
happened
if
he
were
taken
in
custody
and
asked
a
question,
and
then
he
would
have
gotten
miranda
warning
and
could
have
had
a
lawyer
there?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
it
sounded
to
me
that
what
you
were
developing
was
close
to
an
entrapment
kind
of
argument
that
the
government...
you
used
the
word
corners,
i
think.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
yet
you
take...
every
word
that...
you
put
no
weight
at
all
on
any
of
the
words
of
the
statute.
so
far
you've
relied
just
on
this,
an
interpretation
of
one
case.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
i
would
say
to
you--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--what
would
happen,
mr.
holtzman,
if
the
question
had
been
asked,
and
no
answer
given,
and
then
there
wasn't
the
warning
to
your
client
that,
do
you
know
that
it's
a
crime
to
make
a
false
statement
to
an
agent
of
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
here
your
client
can
say
he
didn't
know.
the
statute
has
a
requirement
that
he
act
knowingly
and
wilfully.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
and
the
agent
tells
him,
after
he
said
no.
i'm
asking
you,
do
you...
would
it
have
made
any
difference
if
he...
do
you
put
any
weight
on
his
having
been
told,
after
he
says
no,
do
you
know
it's
a
crime?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
is
it
relevant
that
he
wasn't
told
before
he
said
no?
that's--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
waxman,
may
i
ask
if
it's
simply
a
question
that
it's
not
a
big
deal,
so
we
want
to
aim
at
larger
crimes,
or
is
it
some
reflection
of
the
abuse
that
mr.
holtzman
was
addressing?
for
example,
the
statute
of
limitations
runs
on
a
crime,
you
go
to
the
suspect's
house
and
you
say,
did
you
do
it,
and
he
says
no,
so
you
get
him
for
a
false
statement.
is
there
any
such
thing?
it
doesn't
fit
the
definition
of
entrapment,
but
you
have
been
saying
so
far
it's
not
a
very
serious
crime,
but
is
there
also
some
concern
with
abusive
use
of
this
question?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
in
a
situation
like--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--here,
as
i
understand
it,
the
agent
knew,
had
evidence
before
the
question
was
asked,
that
a
bribe
had
been
taken
by
this
defendant,
so...
well--
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--my
only
question
was,
is
it
there...
here
is
a
policy.
you
read
it
to
us.
you
gave
one
reason
that
there
are
bigger
fish
to
fry.
my
other
question
is,
is
there
anything
behind
this
that
has
to
do
with
good
prosecutorial
conduct,
or
is
it
simply
a
question,
as
you
said,
about
allocation
of
resources?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
--general
waxman
on
materiality,
suppose
it's
crystal
clear
that
the
agent
knows
the
answer,
has
proof
positive
of
the
crime
that
he's
asking
about,
did
you
take
a
bribe,
and
the
agent
has
the
sworn
statement
of
the
briber,
and
then
there's
the
exculpatory
no,
is
that
material
if
the
agent
already
knows
the
answer?
would
that
meet
the
materiality
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
don't
we
attribute
the
agent's
knowledge...
he
made
a
report
to
the
agency.
he
says,
the
employer
said
that
these
union
representatives
took
bribes,
gave
a
list.
now
it's
in
the
records
of
the
agency.
would
it
still
be...
meet
the
materiality
requirement?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
suppose
his
response
had
been,
not
guilty,
instead
of
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
general
waxman,
perjury
is
a
statement
under
oath,
and
i
was
thinking
in
the
noncommunist
affidavit
case,
when
you
have
to
write
out
your
signature,
and
you
affirm
that
this
is
true,
there's
a
more
deliberate
quality
to
that
than
just
blurting
out
no.
so
the
cases
that
you
were
asked
about
that
involved
an
oath,
it
seems
to
me
that
there
is
more
of
a
deliberation
involved
on
the
defendant's
part,
and
that's
why
i
thought
you
had
the
statement
in
the
manual
that
it's
not
appropriate.
i
didn't
think
that
that
was...
it
didn't
sound
to
me
like
it
was
simply
a
resource
allocation
decision.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
well,
suppose
the
rule
were,
when
you
just
say
no,
that's
an
exculpatory
no.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
it
is
what's
happened
in
this
case,
is
it
not?
