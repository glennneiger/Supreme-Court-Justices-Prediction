chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1579,
james
brogan
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
holtzman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
part
of
the
text
of
the
act
do
you
rely
on
for
the
exculpatory
no?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
would
be
absurd
about
the
result
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
gilliland
gives
this
court's
opinion
as
to
what
congress'
intent
was,
but
that
simply
doesn't
prevail
over
the
language
of
the
statute,
which,
as
justice
ginsburg
points
out,
your
client's
answer
is
clearly
within
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
why
we
granted
certiorari,
because
there's
a
conflict
between
the
second
circuit
and
the
other
circuits.
that's
why
we're
here,
to
resolve
that
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there's
no
requirement
in
the
statute
that
it
pervert
the
governmental
function.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
the
bryson
case
we
said
our
legal
system
provides
methods
for
challenging
the
government's
right
to
ask
questions,
but
lying
isn't
one
of
them.
now,
what's
your
response
to
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
he
can
just
be
quiet,
can't
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
what
bryson
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't...
i
agree
with
justice
kennedy.
i
think
your
reading
of
gilliland
is,
i
believe,
mistaken.
i
see
only
one
sentence
in
there
that...
in
the
opinion
that
talks
about
the
perversion,
and
it
says
the
amendment
indicated
the
congressional
intent
to
protect
the
authorized
functions
of
governmental
departments
and
agencies
from
the
perversion
which
might
result
from
the
deceptive
practices
described.
now,
it
doesn't
say
that
was
the
only
intent
of
congress.
it
says
that
is
one
of
the
intents
of
congress,
and
i
have
great
difficulty
seeing
how
you
can
draw
out
of
that
one
sentence,
one
statement,
in
fact
how
the
courts
of
appeals
have
drawn
out
of
that
one
statement--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think
you've
answered
the
question,
mr.
holtzman.
your
time
has
expired.
mr....
general
waxman,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
waxman.
the
case
is
submitted.
