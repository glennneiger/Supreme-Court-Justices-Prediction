justice
antonin
scalia
well,
didn't
your
client
have--
justice
antonin
scalia
--your
client
did
not
have
the
opportunity
to
litigate
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
reason
to
believe
they
would
have
won
the
litigation
in
those
other
two
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
is
not
my
recollection,
and
not
my
belief.
what...
why
do
you
say,
assuming
that
it's
part
of
the
basis
for
this
statute,
and
a
necessary
element
for
conviction
under
this
statute,
that
government
functioning
have
been
impaired?
why
isn't
the
conduct
of
an
investigation
concerning
bribery
and
corruption
within
a
government
agency,
why
isn't
that
investigation
part
of
the
government's
function?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
he
told
the
truth,
it
would
have
certainly
facilitated
the
function,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
is
the
alternative
that
i
have
to
compare
it
with
his
remaining
silent?
why
isn't
the
alternative
his
telling
the
truth?
he
chose
not
to
remain
silent.
justice
antonin
scalia
since
he
did,
he
had
two
options,
to
tell
the
truth
or
to
lie.
by
telling
the
truth,
he
would
have
facilitated
the
investigation.
by
lying,
he
prevented
that
facilitation
from
occurring.
why
does
that
not
impede
the
investigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
people
that
ask
questions,
if
they
would
incriminate
themselves
have
no
obligation
to
answer.
that's
fine.
but
if
they
choose
to
answer,
they
have
to
tell
the
truth,
and
if
they
don't
tell
the
truth,
they
are
impeding
the
investigation.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
limit
statutes
on
the
basis
of
the
particular
evil
that
congress
was
trying
to
remedy.
i
mean,
many
statutes
go
beyond
the
narrow
evil
that
congress
was
immediately
concerned
with.
their
language
is
a
bit
broader,
and
it
includes
some
stuff
on
the
fringes,
and
that's
simply
the
case
here.
there
is
nothing
whatever
in
the
statute
about
impeding
the
investigation.
that's
a
substantial
limitation
on
the
statute,
and
you
want
us
to
read
it
in
even
though
it's
not
expressed?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
any
other
laws
we
do
that
to?
we
say,
well,
the
law
doesn't
say
anything
about
this,
but
really...
really,
what
congress
was
really
worried
about
was
not
what
it
expressed
so
expansively.
it
was
really
worried
about
something
more
narrow,
so
we're
going
to
just
read
the
statute
that
way.
that's
an
extraordinary
way
to
read
statutes.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you
get
congress'
intention
from,
except
the
statute
itself?
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
gilliland--
--did
congress
write
gilliland?
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
maybe
that's
wrong.
nobody
would
have
standing
to
sue
to
make
the
government
do
it
differently,
would
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
to
me--
--it
is
significant.
i
would
worry
about
it.
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
reading
gilliland
for
far
too
much.
the
question
in
that
case
was
whether
or
not
the
statute
should
be
confined
to
property
loss,
or...
to
the
government,
and
the
court
said,
oh,
no.
this
statute
was
designed
to
prevent
perverting
the
function
of
the
government,
it
applies
to
all
agencies
with
all
jurisdiction
of
the
government,
and
that
ended
it.
it
was
basically
a
way
to
reject
a
narrowing
construction.
it
was
not
itself
a
narrowing
construction,
or
am
i
misreading
gilliland?
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
a
fair
point,
mr.
holtzman.
they
ought
to
be
here
with
you.
that's--
[laughter]
could
i
ask
you
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
general
waxman,
can
i
just...
this
was
not
on
your
watch,
i'm
sure,
but
i'm
just
curious
as
to
why
it
took
so
long
for
this
issue
to
come
before
this
court,
and
that
there
are
so
many
circuit
courts
that
have
adopted
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine
over
what,
20
years,
more
than
that,
and
the
justice
department
itself
has
provided
in
its
manual
to
united
states
attorneys
that
where
the
statement
takes
the
form
of
an
exculpatory
no,
18
u.s.c.
section
1001
does
not
apply
regardless
of
who
asks
the
question.
how
did
all
this
happen?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
your
manual
for
united
states
attorneys
recites
it.
where
the
statement
takes
the
form
of
an
exculp...
frankly,
i
wouldn't
have
known
what
an
exculpatory
no
was
until
this
case
came
up,
but
your
manual--
[laughter]
you
know,
where
the
statement
takes
the
form
of
an
exculpatory
no,
1001
does
not
apply.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
does
purport
to
be
that.
it
doesn't
say,
where
the
statement
takes
the
form
of
an
exculpatory
no,
leave
the
fellow
alone.
it
doesn't
say
that.
it
says,
where
it
takes
the
form
of
an
exculpatory
no,
1001
does
not
apply.
i
mean,
so
it
does
purport
to
be
an
interpretation
of
the
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
general
waxman,
just
to
make
clear
i
was
not
making
this
up,
i
was
quoting
the
description
of
the
manual
in
petitioner's
brief
at
page
20.
now,
that
was
the
1988
manual.
maybe
it's
been
revised
since
then,
but
at
least
in
the
1988
manual
it
did
say
that
1001
does
not
apply,
so--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
that's
been
changed.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
tell
me
the
current
manual
does
not
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
always
a...
it
was
always
an
element
of
perjury
offenses
at
common
law
anyway,
and
would
have
been
read
into
the
statute
even
though
it
wasn't
expressed.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
does
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
does
it
shock
you?
i...
it
doesn't
shock...
i...
the
only
difference
is,
i
suppose,
that
a
lot
of
us,
it
is
thought,
don't
always
come
to
a
full
stop,
whereas
very
few
of
us
take
bribes,
but
the
principle--
[laughter]
but
the
principle
is
the
same.
you
shouldn't
lie.
well,
there
may
be
requirements
there.
there
may
be
requirements
in
respect
to
what
you
have
to
tell
the
person,
mightn't
there
be,
that
the
policeman
has
to
say,
i'm
warning
you,
as
the
person
did
here,
there
is
a
statute
that
makes
it
a
crime
for
you
to
answer
the
following
question
falsely,
and
if
you
do,
et
cetera...
is
there
some
requirement
like
that
built
into
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
assume
that's
why
we
have
perjury
laws,
to
stop
people
from
doing
this.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
waxman,
in
addition
to
prosecutorial
discretion
which
you've
been
assuring
us
about,
this
is
a
felony,
and
you're
entitled
to
a
jury
trial,
am
i
not
right
about
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
would
you
want
to
prosecute
somebody
for
rolling
through
a
stop
sign
and
making
the
exculpatory
no?
you
think
it
would
enhance
your
record
as
a
winning
prosecutor?
[laughter]
