may
i
interrupt
you
with
a
question--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--about
the
text,
mr.
waxman.
generally,
the
basic
argument,
you
ought
to
read
this
statute
for
what
it
says.
does
it,
in
your
view,
cover
false
statements
by
the
agents
during
an
investigation?
its
plain
language
clearly
would.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
the
agents--
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
a
false
statement
by
the
agent
who
posed
as
a
narcotics
vendor
would
violate
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it's
material.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
says,
i'm
not
a...
don't
shoot
me,
i'm
not
a
police
officer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
he
not--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
undercover
agents
routinely
violate
this
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
an
undercover
agent,
by
posing
as
not
being
officers,
routinely
violate
this
statute,
in
your
view.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
the
agent
can
lie
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
and
not
be
covered
by
the
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
although
material
doesn't
apply
in
the
next
part.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there
are
prosecutors
who
have
brought
prosecutions
for
motives
that
are
not
entirely
honorable.
that's
part
of
the
problem
with
a
statute
like
this.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not...
you're
of
course
conscious
of
that.
this
case...
this
statute,
by
the
way,
does
not
require
knowledge
that
the
person
who
asked
the
question
was
a
government
agent,
does
it?
