justice
david
h.
souter
well,
does
that
mean
that
in
every
case
in
which
the
officer
who
hears
the
false
statement
knows
that
it
is
false,
that
the
false
statement
is
therefore
outside
the
statute?
justice
david
h.
souter
yes.
i
assume
if
your
client
had
given
a
truthful
answer,
the
answer
would
have
been
used
and
admitted
against
him,
wouldn't
it?
justice
david
h.
souter
so
i
assume
it's
a
good
reason
to
ask
the
question.
justice
david
h.
souter
it's
not
merely
an
investigatory
technique.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
any
case,
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
statutory
violation
is
a
function
of
the
governmental
agent's
state
of
mind.
justice
david
h.
souter
oh,
i
thought
it
was,
because
i
thought
you
said
that
if
the
governmental
agent
who
hears
the
false
answer
knows
it's
false,
that
it
therefore
does
not
fall
within
the
violation--
justice
david
h.
souter
--so
i
assume
the
state
of
mind
of
the
governmental
agent,
therefore,
is
the
touchstone.
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
mr.
holtzman--
justice
david
h.
souter
but
in
the...
under
the
law--
justice
david
h.
souter
--but
under
the
statute
as
it
existed
in
this
case,
there
was
no
express
materiality
requirement.
justice
david
h.
souter
but
if
that
is
so,
and
if
the
government's
position
is
that
that
was
appropriate,
then
how
can
the
government
take
the
position
here
that
the
only
thing
we're
concerned
with
in
this
statute
is
just
what
is
plainly
in
the
text?
you're
agreeing
that
materiality
comes
in.
why
doesn't
the
likelihood
of
perversion
come
in,
too?
justice
david
h.
souter
where
is...
where...
i
didn't
know--
--no.
justice
david
h.
souter
i
beg
your
pardon.
you're
right.
justice
david
h.
souter
that
was
also
the
government's
position?
i
mean--
justice
david
h.
souter
do
you
think
there's
a--
--general...
go
ahead.
do
you
think
there's
a
distinction
under
the
statute
between
no
answer
to
an
investigator's
question,
have
you
ever
committed
the
crime
of
bribery,
as
distinct
from
the
investigator's
question,
did
you
ever
receive
money
from
this
company?
justice
david
h.
souter
knew
law
as
well
as
fact,
right.
right.
yes.
