mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
mr.
chief
justice,
your
honors,
may
it
please
the
court--
the
narrow
issue
presented
by
this
case
is
whether
or
not
a
simple
exculpatory
no,
unelaborated
upon
in
any
way,
is
actionable
under
18
united
states
code
1001.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no.
it
was
never
the
intention
of
congress
that
it
should
be,
and
congress'
intention
is
manifested
by
the
1934
incarnation
of
the
statute,
which
is
basically
the
one
that
we're
dealing
with
here.
and
i
base
my
conclusions
on
the
fact
that
in
united
states
v.
gilliland,
a
1941
decision
of
this
court,
the
court
held
that
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
congress'
intention
in
passing
it,
was
to
protect
the
authorized
functions
of
governmental
departments
and
agencies
from
the
perversion
which
might
result
from
deceptive
practices
which
are
described
in
the
act
itself.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well,
the
portion
of
the...
the
text
itself
does
not
have
a
provision
excluding
from
its
coverage
the
exculpatory
no.
however,
it's
my
position
that
you
cannot
divorce
the
meaning
of
the
statute
from
what
it
was
that
congress
intended
the
function...
the
statute
to
serve
and,
as
i
say,
the
court
in
gilliland
recognized
that,
and
most
recently
in
united
states
v.
woodward
the
court
again
indicated
that
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
statute
and
the
intention
with
which
the
statute
was
passed
by
the
congress.
and,
indeed,
i
might
also
add
that
united
states
v.
lambert,
which
is
a
circuit
court
of
appeals
case,
the
perversion
of
governmental
function
was
characterized
as
the
hallmark
of
a
1001
violation.
it's
the
petitioner's
position
that
a
simple
exculpatory
no
made
in
response
to
a
federal
agent's
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individual
committed
a
particular
crime
cannot
have
the
effect
of
perverting
governmental
functioning
and,
indeed,
following
gilliland
there
ensued
a
landscape
of
jurisdiction
which
came
to
be
conveniently
called
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine
which
began
in
the
1950's
in
the
district
courts
and
then
the
fifth
circuit
in
united
states
v.
paternostro
in
the
early
1960's----
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--no.
my
point
is
that...
my
point
is
that
the
statement
is
false,
or
the
statement
can
be
false--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--no,
i
think
that's
the
new
statute,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
as
opposed
to
the
one
that's
the
subject--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--yes.
the
statute
that
we're
talking
about
is
basically
the
1934
incarnation
of
the
statute,
which
had
some
subsequent
changes
but
not
of
any
significance
in
connection
with
the
issues
involved
in
this
case.
in
1948,
for
example,
the
statute
which,
prior
thereto,
included
false
claims
as
well
as
false
statements
got
divided
up
into
two
separate
sections
of
the
code.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
yes.
in
fact,
actually
the
statute,
your
honor,
says
false...
when
it
refers
to
oral
utterances
refers
to
statements
in
the
plural,
and
i'd
like
to
reserve
a
little
time
to
address
that
very
directly,
if
i
may.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well,
the
courts
have
interpreted
statement
to
mean
those
statements
which
are
capable
of
perverting
governmental
functioning,
and
therefore
the
use
of
the
term
statement
in
the
statute
cannot
refer
to
the
type
of
statement
that
we're
talking
about,
namely,
the
exculpatory
no.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
pardon
me?
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
this
court
has
not
said
that
specifically,
but
in--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--i'm
not
disagreeing
with
that
proposition
as
a
general
matter.
what
i
am
saying,
however,
is
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
that
where
the
application
of
the
statute,
plain
meaning
application
of
the
statute
would
pervert
or
thwart
congress'
intent
or
produce
absurd
results,
then
there
is
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--well,
the
absurd
result
that
would
ensue
here
is
the
fact
that,
as
gilliland
indicated,
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
or
the
intention
of
the
congress
was
to
prevent
the
perversion
of
governmental
functioning.
the
kind
of--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--no...
well,
i
respectfully
disagree
on
this
ground.
as
i
say,
at
one
time
as
many
as
eight
circuits
took
the
position
that
i'm
articulating,
to
wit
that
you
had
to
look
to
gilliland
to
find
out
what
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--yes,
i
understand
that.
i
understand
that
very
well.
the
point
that
i
was
trying
to
make
was
that
the
exculpatory
no,
in
the
context
that
we're
talking
about,
is
incapable
of,
as
a
matter
of
law,
and
so
the
circuits
have
held,
of
perverting
governmental
functioning.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
no,
but
this
court,
as
i
say,
has
held
in
gilliland
that
that
is
what
the
statute
is
about,
that
the
statute
was
passed
with
the
intention
of
preventing
and
punishing
those
false
statements
the
effect
of
which
is
to
pervert
governmental
functioning,
and
the
juris...
this...
the
juris...
excuse
me,
the
jurisprudence
that
has
grown
up
surrounding
this
has
pointed
directly
to
that.
in
other
words,
that
the
reference
to
the
term
statement
does
not
embrace
a
statement
that
does
not
have
the
potency,
the
power
to
undermine
governmental
functioning
in
this
particular--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--in
substance,
yes,
it
does,
because
as
the
lower
courts
have
indicated,
that
an
experienced
federal
agent,
when
he
hears
the
exculpatory
no,
especially
in
this
case...
this
presents
perhaps
a
wonderful
context
in
which
to
view
it...
didn't
ask
the
question,
and
doesn't
normally
ask
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
individual
has
committed
the
crime
in
order
to
evaluate
the
truth
or
the
falsity
of
the
statement.
instead,
it's
generally
a...
an
investigative
technique,
and
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--indeed,
i
believe
it
would,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
it
is
a
good
reason,
but
on
the
other
hand
in
the
circumstance--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--well,
it
is
an
investigatory
technique
in
the
sense
that,
certainly
in
this
case,
this
was
a
prelude,
so
to
speak,
to
induce
the
cooperation
of
the
petitioner
to
perhaps
testify
against
other
individuals
that
the
government
had
evidence
against
were
culpable
in
connection
with
this
acceptance
either
of
bribes
or
gratuities.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
no,
it's
not
a
function
of
the
governmental--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--well,
certainly
under
those
circumstances
it
does
not
fall
within
them.
that's
one
circumstance.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well,
the
touchstone
is
whether
or
not
the
response
is
going
to
send
the
government
off
on
a
wild
goose
chase
or,
in
the
alternative,
is
the
exculpatory
no
response,
nothing
different
than,
really,
silence,
and
just
sends
the
government
agent
back
to
his
office
to
continue
doing--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--the
investigative
work
that
he
normally
does.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well,
my
response
to
that
is,
first
of
all
i
don't
take
the
position
that
lies
are
protected
as
a
general
proposition.
i
think
that
the
government
took
the
view
that
the
fifth
amendment
does
not
protect
lies.
i
might
say
that
the
exculpatory
no
jurisprudence,
in
addition
to
articulating
the
considerations
from
gilliland,
have
also
expressed
a
solicitude
for
the
fifth
amendment,
although
they've
never...
no
court
that
i
know
of
has
indicated
that
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
occurs
as
a
result
of
cornering
a
suspect
into
either,
on
the
one
hand
incriminating
himself,
which
is
somewhat
incompatible
with
the
accusatorial
nature
of
our
system
of
justice
or,
on
the
other
hand,
committing
a
1001
violation.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--well,
in
bryson
there's
a
distinction
because
of
the
fact
that...
as
i
recall
the
facts
in
bryson...
i
think
we're
talking
also
perhaps
about
knox
as
well...
there
was
the
opportunity
by
the
individuals
in
those
cases
to
contest
the
questions
that
they
wound
up
answering
falsely.
in
other
words,
in
bryson,
if
i
remember
correctly,
it
was
a
situation
in
which
the
individual
had
to
file
an
affidavit
with
the
nlrb
indicating
that
he
was
not
a
communist.
in
knox
it
was
a
case
involving
the
filing
of
tax
forms
with
respect
to
gambling
earnings
and
employees,
et
cetera.
and
in
each
of
those
cases
certainly
there's
a
distinguishing
factor
in
that
each
of
those
individuals
had
the
opportunity,
by
the
process
of
litigation,
if
you
will,
rather
than
being
confronted
by
agents
in
their
house,
of
litigating
the
propriety
of
the
questions
being
posed
to
them
and
whether
or
not--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--there
was
a
selfincrimination
factor.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well,
the
circumstances
were
such
here--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--i
don't
know.
i
think
in
one
of
those
cases--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--i
don't...
i
think
in
one
of
those
cases
there
was
an
indication,
and
perhaps
in
both
of
them
that
there
was
an
indication
that
subsequent
case
law
indicated
that
the
individuals
in
those
cases
would
ultimately
have
prevailed
had
they
taken
that
course.
that
is
my
recollection
of
those
cases.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
it
is
part
of
the
government's
function,
but
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
false
exculpatory
no
response
perverts
that
function,
and
i
suppose
that
one
way
in
which
i
can
dramatically
illustrate
it
is
the
rogers
case.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
it
would
have
facilitated
it.
i
don't
deny
that
for
a
moment.
but
on
the
other
hand,
the
question
is,
did
it
pervert
it?
did
the
government
do
anything
different
than
they
would
have
done
had
he
simply
remained
silent
and,
indeed,
i
might
point
out
to
you
that
there
was
not
a
scintilla
of
evidence
at
this
trial
that
after
the
response
from
grogan
the
government
went
off
and
did
anything
that
they
wouldn't
otherwise
have
done
had
he
remained
silent.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
there
was
not
offered
any
evidence.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
correct.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
it
doesn't
pervert
the
investigation.
perhaps
we're
talking
semantics
between
impeding.
the
government
investigative
agent's
job
is
to
go
out
and
investigate
the
commission
of
crimes
so
as
to
bring
them
to
prosecution.
if
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--well,
when
you
say
choose
to
answer,
with
all
due
respect
to
your
honor,
perhaps
that
something
of...
and
i
say
with
all
due
respect
to
you,
perhaps
a
somewhat
simplistic
way
to
look
at
this,
in
the
sense
that
the
jurisprudence
that
is
emanated
on
this
subject,
and
when
i
refer
to
the
subject
i'm
talking
about
the
mind
set
of
the
individual
confronted
by
a
police
officer
in
uniform,
or
an
individual
who
appears
at
your
house
and
displays
a
badge
indicating
that
he's
an
fbi
agent,
and
we've
cited
a
series
of
cases
in
our
brief,
one
doesn't
have
the
feeling
that
they
are
volunteering
responses
to
questions.
one
has
the
feeling
that
the
questions
posed
demand
an
answer,
as
opposed
to,
would
you
like
to
answer
or
would
you
like
not
to
answer,
so
it's
not
as--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--well,
i'm
not
saying--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--no,
no,
i'm
not
asking
the
court
to
hold
that,
by
the
way.
i'd
like
to
make
that
clear.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
certainly
there
are
fifth
amendment
implications
in
this,
as
recognized
by
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals
over
the
course
of
30
years
and
while,
as
i
said
moments
ago,
no
court
of
appeals
has
said
that
this
practice
violates
the
fifth
amendment,
certainly
the
courts
have
said
that
it
comes
uncomfortably
close
to
doing
that.
and
i
don't
know
that
the
opinions
of
all
of
these
courts
of
appeals
on
that
subject,
namely
the
notion
of
coming
uncomfortably
close,
that
the
government
is
going
to
corner
you
and
either
force
you
in
effect
to
incriminate
yourself
or,
alternatively,
violate
another
criminal
statute,
especially
where
there's
an
opportunity,
if
the
statute
were
to
be
so
interpreted
as
to
permit
that,
where
you
can
have
all
kinds
of
absurd
results.
for
example,
in
this
case
the
very
offenses
with
respect
to
which
the
questioning
occurred
were
ones,
with
one
exception,
one
payment,
the
statute
of
limitations
had
passed.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well,
i
might
say
to
your
honor
that
if
he
had
been
advised
of
that,
that
might
be
all
the
more
reason
to
tell
the
truth.
the
government,
of
course,
i
might
say
had
a
theory
about
this
case,
namely
that
it
was
a
continuing
offense,
and
that
therefore
the
statute
of
limitations
hadn't
passed,
although
the
district
court
ultimately
ruled
that
it
had.
but
what
i'm
suggesting
to
your
honor
is
that
if
this
statute
is
permitted
to
be
wielded
in
this
way,
in
disregard,
in
effect,
of
what
the
intention
of
congress
was
in
enacting
it,
then
you
have
a
situation
in
which
it
is
subject
to
tremendous
abuse,
and
i
might
also
mention--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--yes,
i
do,
because
of
the
reasons
that
i
indicated,
namely
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--your
honor,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
that
it
would
be
an
extraordinary
way,
because
it
would
divorce,
in
effect,
the
intention
with
which
congress
passed
the
statute
from
the
way
in
which
it's
being
applied.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
right
from
gilliland,
your
honor.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
right
from
gilliland.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
no,
no.
this
court
interpreted
the
statute
in
gilliland.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
no.
i
cannot...
i
can't...
and
i
cannot
place
any
emphasis
on
any
particular
words
in
the
statute.
as
i
say,
the
exculpatory
no
jurisprudence
evolved
as
a
result
of
this
court's
decision
in
gilliland
and
the
circuit
courts
of
appeals'
understanding
as
to
how
this
statute
was
to
operate,
and
one
of
the
ways
it
was
not
to
operate,
and
one
of
the
things
that
congress
did
not
intend,
was
for
this
statute
to
be
used
in
the
fashion
that
it
has
been
used.
and
even
the
government,
i
might
say,
in
its
policy
statement
has
eschewed
the
use
of
the
statute
in
this
very
way.
if
you
look
at
the
government's
policy
statement
with
respect
to
prosecutions
under
1001,
the
government
says
that
such
prosecutions
should
not
ensue
where
there's
just
a
simple
exculpatory
no
response,
unadorned,
unelaborated
upon.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
no,
but
i
would
suggest
to
your
honor
that
it's
of
some
significance
that
the
government's
own
view,
the
agency
that
is
in
charge
of
prosecutions
of
the
federal
law,
has
adopted
this
policy,
and--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--no.
my
understanding
is
the
enactment
prior
to
1934,
which
was
interpreted
in
cohn,
or
the
statute
was
interpreted
in
cohn,
the
incarnation
prior
to
1934,
indicated
it
was
directed
only
at
pecuniary
losses.
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
in
order
to
aid
enforcement
of
new
deal
legislation,
went
to
congress
in
view
of
the
cohn
decision
and
apparently
urged
that
there
be
a
statute
that
would
protect
the
government
against
something
beyond
or
in
addition
to
pecuniary
interests,
and
gilliland
indeed
indicated
that
the
statute,
which
was
the
'34
enactment,
was
calculated
to
prevent
and
the
intention
of
the
congress
was
to
prevent
the
perversion
of
governmental
functioning,
and
it's
from
that
point
of
departure--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--no,
no.
it
may
have
been...
it
may
have
been...
it
may
well
have
been
in
that
context,
but
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
gilliland
certainly
was
interpreted
for
40
years
in
the
way
in
which
i'm
indicating.
namely,
the
exculpatory
no
doctrine
found
its
origin
in
the
1950's,
and
by
the
1960's,
and
i'm
talking
about
district
courts
in
the
fifties,
but
by
1960
paternostro,
the
fifth
circuit,
based
upon
exactly
what
i'm
referring
to,
namely
the
language
of
the
gilliland
decision,
interpreted
the
statute
as
not
being
applicable
to
this
type
of
situation.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
i
was
about
to
say,
i...
thankfully
i'm
not
alone
in
this
interpretation.
there
have
been
eight
courts
of
appeals
which
have
taken
the
same
view
that
i
have
taken,
or
that
i'm
advocating
at
this
point,
and
it's
based,
certainly,
on
the
gilliland
decision
coming
from
this
august
body.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
if
your
honor
would
permit
me
i'd
like
to
go
out,
perhaps,
and
make
a
few
phone
calls.
maybe
that's
what's
appropriate
at
this
juncture.
[laughter]
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--number
1--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--no,
but
you
can
use--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--well--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--the
most
abusive
is
to
take
a
situation,
for
example,
such
as
existed
in
this
case,
in
which
ultimately
judge
bryant
in
the
district
court
held
that
the
statute
of
limitations
had
passed
with
respect
to
these
various
payments,
go
to
the
guy's
house,
and
in
effect
revive
these
offenses
with
respect
to
which
the
statute
of
limitations
had
passed.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
you
could
say
that,
but
on
the
other
hand,
you
can
also
see
that
there
is
a
widespread
opportunity
for
abuse
if
the
statute
is
permitted
to
be
used
in
this
fashion
and,
as
i
say,
it
was
not
congress'
intention,
and
it
may
be
that
there
is
only
one
sentence
in
gilliland,
but
the
sentence,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
there,
and--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--you
could
take
a
situation,
for
example,
in
which
the
government
suspects
or
strongly
suspects
that
an
individual
has
committed
a
crime
but
for
one
reason
or
another
cannot
prove,
for
example,
a
particular
element
of
that
crime.
a
convenient
way
to
get
that
person,
so
to
speak,
is
to
go
and
see
him
and
ask
whether
or
not
he
committed
the
crime
under
circumstances
analogous
to
the
ones
i'm
talking
about
here.
i'm
not
talking
about
calling
someone
in
front
of
a
grand
jury,
where
they
get
an
appointment,
et
cetera.
i'm
talking
about
knocking
on
the
person's
door
and
asking
this
question
directly
in
an
atmosphere
that's
fraught--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--well,
indeed
that
would
present
a
different
situation,
obviously,
but
i
won't
take
the
position--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--yes,
and
i
think
that
there
is
an
element
of
that,
undoubtedly,
just
as
there
is
an
element
of...
as
the
circuit
courts
have
articulated,
of
coming
uncomfortably
close
to
a
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment,
but
i
won't
take
the
position
and
i
don't
take
the
position
that
it's
simply
a
question
of
cornering.
my
position
is
that
it's
a
question
of
whether
or
not
this
statute
embraces
this
type
of
conduct,
notwithstanding
its
expansive
language,
and
i
say
that
because
of
the--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--a
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
case,
your
honor,
upon
which,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out...
not
pointed
out,
but
agreed
with
me
that
numerous
other
circuit
courts
of
appeals
have
also
taken
that
position.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
to
say
that
that's
frivolous
in
the
face
of
the
exculpatory
no
jurisdiction,
i
would
respectfully
submit
is
inappropriate.
it
may
be
that
this
court
will
disagree
with
those--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
ginsburg.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
yes.
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
well,
having
been
told
after
he
says
no
is
utterly
irrelevant
as
far
as
i'm
concerned,
because
even
if
one
were
to
contend,
or
were
the
court
to
hold
that--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--your
honor,
i
submit
that
it's
not,
because
it's
a
question
of
statutory
interpretation
rather
than
giving
warnings.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
second
circuit
did
comment
on
the
fact
that
he
was
told
that
it
was
a
crime
to
lie
to
federal
agents,
but,
of
course--
mr.
stuart
a.
holtzman
--thank
you.
