justice
o'connor
well,
i
have
trouble
with
your
present
articulation
of
the
question,
too.
you
seem
to
be
shoe-horning
it
into
an
incomplete
verdict
argument,
but
i
thought
the
question
presented
related
to
the
failure
of
the
court
to
give
an
instruction,
and
all
of
a
sudden
we're
hearing
some
new
articulation.
i
don't
know
why
you're
doing
that.
is
it
to
try
to
get
it
into
some
other
case
or
something?
justice
o'connor
what
happened
here
was,
there
isn't
an
instruction
on
one
element.
now,
what
is
that
element?
that
he
knew
it
was
a
silencer?
justice
o'connor
and
what's
the
specific
crime
that
we're
talking
about
here,
the
possession
of
a
silencer?
justice
o'connor
uh-huh.
justice
o'connor
and
you
say
that
that
can
never
be
a
harmless
error,
the
failure
to
instruct?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
if
it's
clear
from
the
evidence
that
the
defendant
says,
yeah,
i
had
a
silencer.
i
knew
it
was
a
silencer.
justice
o'connor
harmless
error
possible?
justice
o'connor
could
we
look
at
the
instructions
so
that
i
see
specifically
what
you're
finding
fault
with?
i
think
they're
in
the
appendix
on
pages
104
and
105.
justice
o'connor
joint
appendix.
justice
o'connor
but
over
on
the
next
page,
in
105,
the
court
instructed
that
the
firearm,
the
term
firearm
includes
a
silencer.
the
defendant
can
be
found
guilty
of
that
offense
only
if
all
the
following
facts
are
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
first,
that
the
defendant
at
the
time
and
place
charged
in
the
indictment
knowingly
possessed
a
firearm
as
defined
above.
justice
o'connor
in
staples,
but
in
staples,
now
we
had
a
situation
where
a
machine
gun...
it
wasn't
clear
whether
it
was
a
machine
gun
or
a
rifle.
it
could
have
been
either.
now,
a
silencer
is
a
silencer
is
a
silencer.
justice
o'connor
we
don't
have
the
same
problem
with
a
silencer,
do
we?
justice
o'connor
why?
justice
o'connor
well,
why
isn't
there
some
difference
there?
i
mean,
i
can
understand
where
there's
some
reason
not
to
understand
that
a
particular
weapon
could
be
a
machine
gun
if
it
had
certain
characteristics,
otherwise
it
was
a
rifle,
but
what's
the
difference
of
a
silencer?
justice
o'connor
mr.
nuechterlein,
what
is
it
that
the
government
concedes
was
error
in
the
instruction
here
that
we're
talking
about
on
the
silencer?
justice
o'connor
well,
be
more
specific.
what
is
it
that
the
judge
should
have
said
that
he
didn't
say?
justice
o'connor
i've
never
heard...
look--
--i
mean,
he
did...
an
instruction
was
given
that
the
jury
had
to
find
the
defendant
at
the
time
and
place
knowingly
possessed
a
firearm
as
described
above,
and
described
above
includes
a
silencer.
now,
they
were
told
that.
justice
o'connor
and
that's
not
correct?
justice
o'connor
i
just
am
trying
to
find
out
what
it
is
the
government
says
that's
missing,
instead
of
just
being
ambiguous.
mr.
nuechterlein,
isn't
it
true
that
the
instruction
that
justice
o'connor
and
justice
breyer
focus
on
related
to
count
3,
and
there
wasn't
a
similar
description
with
respect
to--
--count
2.
count
2.
