justice
kennedy
i
take
it
that
interstate
commerce,
which
is
a
jurisdictional
requisite
to
many
federal
crimes,
and
i
think
can
be
called
an
element
of
the
offense,
has
to
be
charged
and
considered
by
the
jury
in
every
case,
even
though
it
was
obvious
that
interstate
commerce
is
involved.
justice
kennedy
and
defenses,
the
same
thing?
defenses
to
the
mens
rea
that's
necessary
for
a
crime,
those
are
also
included
in
your
rule?
justice
kennedy
suppose
there
are
two
counts,
as
there
were
in
this
case,
submitted
to
the
jury
and
under
the
law
each
count
requires
knowing
that
it's
a
silencer,
but
as
to
count
1
the
judge
instructs
that
that's
not
an
issue,
and
as
to
count
2...
but
then
he's
convicted
on
both
counts.
can
you
go
back
and
sustain
the
conviction
on
both
counts?
justice
kennedy
well,
they--
justice
kennedy
--suppose
they
found
there
was
a
silencer
on
one
count
which
was
rather
minor
so
far
as
the
sentence
is
concerned,
but
then
as
to
the
major
count
the
judge
instructs
knowledge
is
not...
this
is
not
for
you
to
consider,
what
result
there?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
they
haven't
considered
the
whole
crime,
pursuant
to
your
earlier
discussion.
they
haven't
had
this
dynamic
of
facing
the
whole
crime,
which
you
describe
in
your
reply
brief.
justice
kennedy
well,
they
actually
stipulated
that
the
machine
gun
count
was
reversible
for
this
same
flaw,
did
it
not?
justice
kennedy
the
moats
case,
which
you
cite
at
the
outset
of
your
brief,
i
think
somewhat
unfairly,
you
later
explain
i
think
quite
accurately.
i
don't
think
it
really
supports
your
position.
moats
is
not
an
elements
case.
moats
is
easily
distinguishable
by
the
petitioner,
is
it
not?
justice
kennedy
well,
but
it's
not
an
element,
it's
not
instructional
error.
it's
just
not
this
case.
if
we
rule
for
the
petitioner,
do
we
have
to
overrule
any
of
our
cases?
justice
kennedy
is
that
because
the
element
was
admitted,
or
because
the
element
is
somehow
trivial
compared
to
the
other
elements?
justice
kennedy
admitted.
justice
kennedy
so
that
you
could
direct
a
criminal...
a
verdict
of
guilty
if
the
defendant
admits
all
the
essentials
of
the
crime.
justice
kennedy
mr.
nuechterlein--
--and
how
does
the
fact
of
the
defendant's
admitting
the
element
bear
on
your
centrality
analysis?
your
test
that
you
offer
is
us
whether
or
not
the
jury
played
a
central
role
in
the
proceeding.
i
hope
i'm
not
misinterpreting...
that's
the
way
i
understand
your
position.
justice
kennedy
what
does
the
defendant's
having
admitted
the
element
as
opposed,
say,
to
10
witnesses
having
testified
to
it,
have
to
do
with
that?
