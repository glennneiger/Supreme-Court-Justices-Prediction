justice
scalia
i
was
surprised
to
hear
you
concede
the
point
that
a...
that
justice
souter
began
with
that
a
trial
is
held,
in
criminal
cases
at
least,
only
to
resolve
those
issues
that
are
joined.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
suppose
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
i
am
pleading
not
guilty,
your
honor,
but
of
course
i
committed
the
crime,
does
that
mean
you
don't
need
a
trial?
justice
scalia
you
still
need
a
trial.
you
need
a
jury...
a
jury
verdict
that
he
committed
it.
justice
scalia
--mr.
rubinstein,
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
a
district
court's
failure
to
instruct
on
an
element
of
an
offense
is
harmless
error
where
at
trial
the
defendant
admitted
that
element.
did
the
government
contend
that
this
question
is
not
involved
in
the
case--
justice
scalia
--in
its
opposition
to
the
petition
for
certiorari?
did
it
say
that
there
was
no
ambiguity...
that
there
was
ambiguity
in
the
charge,
and
that
the
element
was
included?
had
it
said
that,
we
wouldn't
have
taken
the
case.
justice
scalia
and
you
might
add
in
there
that
he
asked
for
the
instruction
to
be
given
and
it
was
denied.
he
did
object
to
its
not
being
given.
justice
scalia
okay.
and
the
issue
is,
you
say
he's
entitled
to
have
them
all
given,
and
even
when
he
objects
when
one
is
not
given,
the
issue
is
whether
it
makes
any
difference,
whether
there's
any
remedy
for
it.
justice
scalia
that
depends
on
whether
you
consider
it
to
be
an
ipso
facto
unfairness
not
to
have
a
jury
pronouncement
that
you
committed
all
the
elements
of
this
crime.
i
don't
think
it's
unfair,
procedurally
unfair
to
say
to
somebody
who
comes
in
and
says
yes,
i
did
all
of
the
things
that
constitute
the
element
of
the
crime,
but
i
want
to
plead
not
guilty,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
procedurally
unfair
for
the
judge
to
say,
get
out
of
here,
you
admitted
it
all.
you've
admitted
you're
guilty.
go
to
jail.
that's
not
procedurally
unfair.
but
unfortunately,
the
man
has
a
right
to
a
jury
trial,
and
even
though
he's
admitted
it,
you
have
to
have
a
jury
say
he
did
it.
that's
what's
at
issue
here,
and
i
don't
think
it
characterizes
it
fairly
to
say
that
what
you're
talking
about
is
procedural
fairness.
there
is
a
requirement
of
a
jury
trial
that
may
not
have
anything
to
do
with
fairness.
justice
scalia
sullivan
differs
from
this
case
in
that
there
was
a
jury
finding
of
the
element.
the
question
is
whether
the
jury
finding
was
tainted
by
the
presumption
that
the
judge
told
the
jury
to...
that
it
had
to
make,
but
the
jury
did
have
a
finding
there,
didn't
it?
justice
scalia
maybe
a
federal
bank
is
a
better
example.
if
the
crime
is
that
you
must
knowingly
rob
a
federal
bank,
when
you
say
knowingly
rob,
does
it
mean
that
your
knowledge
just
has
to
extend
to
the
robbing,
or
does
it
also
have
to
extend
to
the
fact
that
it's
a
federal
bank,
and
i
think
it
is
ambiguous
here.
justice
scalia
at
least
ambiguous,
and
maybe
less
than
that.
justice
scalia
rightly
so,
in
my
view.
justice
scalia
nine-tenths,
9
out
of
10
elements
you
can
direct
a
verdict
on,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
you
know,
how
close
do
we
slice
this?
justice
scalia
i
see--
justice
scalia
when
there's
a
mandatory
conclusive
presumption,
the
jury
comes
in
with
a
finding
that
that
element
was
met
pursuant
to
the
presumption,
and
when
you
say
certain
conditions
are
met,
the
conditions
are
that
that...
either
some
other
finding
would
have
inevitably
led
to
that,
or
that
it
have
been
admitted,
but
the
jury
would
have
come
in
with
a
finding,
nonetheless.
justice
scalia
mr.
nuechterlein,
can
i
ask
about
the
sworn
testimony
here.
did
he
really
admit
in
open
court
that
he
knew
that
a
silencer
was
a
silencer
at
the
time
that
he
possessed
it?
did
he
make
that
admission,
or
did...
was
it
very
clear
from
his
testimony
that
generally
speaking
he
now
knows
what
silencers
are.
justice
scalia
he
was
shown
a
silencer.
he
says,
sure
i
know
what
that
is.
how
do
you
know?
i've
used
them
in
vietnam.
you
knew
exactly
what
the
silencer
were
the
moment
they
were
shown
to
you
at
trial.
yes,
absolutely,
sir.
when
you
depend
for
your
life
on
silencers,
you
know
how
to
take
them
apart.
so
it
was
conclusively
shown
at
trial
that
this
is
a
person
who
now
knows
very
well
what
silencers
are,
but
he
never
really
got
up
at
trial
and
said,
at
the
time
that
i
had
this
silencer
in
the
car
i
knew
what
it
was.
in
fact,
he
denied
he
ever
had
it
in
the
car,
so
he
couldn't
have
made
such
an
admission.
justice
scalia
ah,
so
we
now
do
not
have
a
precise
admission
of
the
very
element
that
has
to
be
proven.
justice
scalia
but
something
which
makes
it
almost
incredible
that
that
element
didn't
exist,
but
nonetheless
not
a
precise
admission
of
that
element.
justice
scalia
i
knew
it
when?
not
at
the
time
the
crime
was
committed.
i
knew
it
when
it
was
shown
to
me
at
trial,
because
he
claimed
he
didn't
have
it--
justice
scalia
--right
after
his
arrest.
