justice
souter
mr.
rubinstein,
what
if
the
defendant
at
his
arraignment
said...
the
judge
said,
well,
how
do
you
plead,
and
he
said,
i
plead
not
guilty,
except
that
i
perfectly
well
knew
that
this
object
that
they're
talking
about
was
a
silencer.
would
he
have
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
on
that
element
then?
justice
souter
well,
the...
i
mean,
i
guess
it's
obvious
the
theory
is
that
the
trial
is
held
to
resolve
issues
which
are
joined,
and
that
issue
is
not
joined
in
the
hypothesis
that
i
give,
so
i
would
suppose
there
was
a
pretty
good
argument
there
for
the
propriety
of
removing
that
from
the
jury's
consideration.
justice
souter
then
the
same
thing
would
be
true
here,
i
suppose,
if
he
stands
up
at
a
later
point
and
says,
look,
i
know
about
that.
that...
there's
no
question
about
that
element.
and
i
take
it
what
your
argument
would
boil
down
to
then
would
be
that
the
failure
here
is
the
failure
to
conduct
a
kind
of
waiver
hearing.
in
other
words,
if
the
judge
had
said,
now,
wait
a
minute,
you
can
admit
that
if
you
want
to,
and
we'll
take
it
away
from
the
jury
if
you
understand
that
you
are
waiving
your
jury
trial
right
and
there's
a
burden
of
proof
and
so
on,
the
kind
of
boykin
thing.
so
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
if
they'd
gone
through
a
boykin
analysis
on
this
element
it
would
be
perfectly
permissible
to
take
it
from
the
jury.
is
that
true?
justice
souter
yes,
but
mr....
i'm
sorry.
finish
your
answer.
justice
souter
in
the
normal
question
when
we
apply
a
harmless
error
analysis,
we
ask,
can
it
be
found
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
the
error
did
not
contribute
to
the
verdict.
what
we
are
asking
is,
did
they
return
a
verdict
on
the
necessary
elements
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
an
error,
and
sometimes
the
answer
is,
sure,
because
we
can
tell
from
what
they
found,
assuming
they
followed
the
rest
of
the
instructions,
that
they
must
have
covered
this
point
as
to
which
specifically
the
instruction
was
inadequate.
but
we
can't
do
that
in
the
case
that
at
least
we're
assuming
we
have
here
in
which
there
was
a
complete
omission
of
any
reference
to
the
element,
and
it
is
not
claimed
that
in
finding
some
other
element,
or
some
other
subsidiary
fact,
they
must
have
found
this
element.
so
the
harmless
error
analysis
is
functioning,
if
it
is
applied
here,
i
think,
in
an
essentially
different
way
from
the
way
it
functions
in
the
normal
case.
do
you
agree
with
that
proposition?
justice
souter
--essential
as
to
what?
we
normally
define
essentiality
with
reference
to
elements,
and
if
that
essential
jury
function
is
missing
on
one,
why,
even
on
your
premise,
is
there
not
an
essential
denial
or
failure
of
the
jury
role?
justice
souter
mr.
nuechterlein,
i
don't...
taking
those
two
central
elements
of
fairness
and
substantial
activity
by
the
jury
in
reaching
the
verdict
it
does
render,
i
don't
know
why
we
shouldn't...
if
those
are
of
such
significance
i
don't
know
why
we
shouldn't
change
our
standard
for
harmless
error
review
in
a
very
essential
respect.
because
we
say
now,
however
overwhelming
the
evidence
may
have
been,
however
adequate
the
evidence
may
have
been
to
convict,
despite
the
fact
that
the
jury
certainly,
let's
say,
considered
9
out
of
the
10
elements
clearly,
and
the
instructional
error
only
goes
to
one
element,
despite
the
overwhelming
power
of
the
evidence
on
that
element,
if
we
cannot
say
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
effect
that
the
jury
did
find
what
was
necessary,
we
reverse.
it's
not
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test.
why
shouldn't
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test
be
appropriate
so
long
as
the
evidence
is
so
overwhelming
that
there's
no
unfairness
in
sending
someone
away
with
a
record
like
that,
and
number
2,
in
reaching
whatever
verdict
the
jury
did
reach,
it
certainly
engaged
in
a
substantial
amount
of
fact-finding,
even
if
there
was
an
error
with
respect
to
one
element.
why
doesn't
each
of
your
central
conditions
get
satisfied
on,
we'll
say,
a
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
test,
whereas
in
normal
harmless
error
review
that
isn't
enough?
justice
souter
it's
not
in
a
case
in
which
a
stipulation
is
involved,
and
yet
if
a
stipulation
of
fact
is
involved
and
nothing
more,
we
don't
say
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
is
enough.
