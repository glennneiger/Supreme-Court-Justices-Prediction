justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you...
you're
saying
where
the
essence
of
the
right
to
a
jury
trial
is
denied
and,
of
course,
the
principal
purpose
of
the
jury
is
to
resolve
disputed
issues
of
fact,
and
is
it
equally
important
to
have
the
jury
pass
on
an
undisputed
issue
of
fact,
where
everybody
agrees
what
the
facts
are?
justice
stevens
and
why?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
it's
not
merely
an
admission
which,
sometimes
admissions
are
more
probative
than
others,
but
it's
also
the...
as
counsel
agreed
that
the
facts...
as
i
remember
the
record
here,
that
the
facts
are
that
he
in
fact
knew
that
it
was
a
silencer.
justice
stevens
no,
but
that's
on
the
same
count.
he's
introduced
a
second
count,
and
there's
no
reason...
juries
may
return
inconsistent
verdicts.
justice
stevens
see,
pope,
it
was
all
one
count.
justice
stevens
that
wouldn't
impeach
the
verdict.
you
can
have
inconsistent
verdicts.
justice
stevens
it
explicitly
says
that
you
don't
have
to
know
it
was
a
firearm
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
and
that's
the
instructions
he
wanted,
but
that
is
not
the
instruction
that
staples
requires.
staples
merely
requires
knowledge
that
it
was
a
silencer,
and
he
did
not
request
the
instruction
that
staples
requires,
did
he?
justice
stevens
you
made
a
lot
of
assumptions
in
order
to
have
us
decide
a
very
important
question.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
mr.
nuechterlein,
can
i
ask
you
to
comment
on
a
rather
broad
point
that
is
troubling
me
about
this
case.
it's
been
apparent
from
some
of
the
questioning
by
justice
thomas
and
justice
breyer
in
particular
that
the
government
elected
not
to
make
what
was
a
fairly
strong
argument
that
the
issue
really
isn't
presented
in
this
case,
and
this
is
a
terribly
important
constitutional
question
affecting
state
trials
all
over
the
country,
and
this
court,
too,
and
our
normal
practice
is
not
to
address
constitutional
questions
unless
absolutely
necessary
to
resolve
the
case,
and
you
failed
in
your
opposition
to
the
cert
petition
to
tell
us,
to
even
make
the
argument
that
this...
we
didn't
have
to
reach
this
question
to
decide
this
case.
did
you
do
that
because
you
thought
you
might
win
a
huge
victory
that
would
cover
all
these
cases?
justice
stevens
you
thought
it
was
so
clear
that
even
though
some
of
us
are
troubled
by
the
instruction
you
didn't
even
want
to
point
it
out
to
us.
