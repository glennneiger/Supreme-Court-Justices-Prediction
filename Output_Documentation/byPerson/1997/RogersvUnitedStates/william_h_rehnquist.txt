chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
now
in
number
96-1279,
george
c.
rogers
v.
the
united
states.
mr.
rubinstein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
when
you
say
an
incomplete
verdict,
you
don't
mean
that
the
verdict
formed
was
incomplete,
do
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
let's
take
a
look
and...
are
you
saying
that
the
form
of
the
jury
verdict
didn't
comply
with
law?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that
isn't
in
the
form
of
a
jury...
that
isn't
in
an
ordinary
jury
verdict,
that
they
find
every
element
of
the
offense,
is
it?
they
simply
find
a
person
guilty
or
not
guilty.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
that
was
done
here,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
yes,
but
that's
a
little
different
than
saying
the
jury
rendered
a
flawed
verdict
in
the
sense
of
some
defect
in
the
form
of
the
verdict.
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
sullivan
the
failure
wasn't
to
give
an
instruction
about
reasonable
doubt,
was
it
not?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
there,
one
could
say
that
the
jury
had
not
found
anything
the
way
it
should
have.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
plain
error
doctrine
as
enunciated
in
olano
refers
back
to
the
atkinson
case
and
says
you
don't
reverse
if
the
reversal
would
seriously...
unless
it
would
seriously
affect
the
fairness
and
integrity
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
how
do
you
think
a
reversal
here
would
affect
the
public
perception
of
judicial
proceedings
where
your
client
admitted
the
element
that
you
say
is
missing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
know,
that's
what
harmless
error's
all
about,
is
technical
things
like
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
rule
would
carry
over
to
the
states,
too,
i
suppose,
so
that
any
failure
on
the
part
of
a
state
court
to
charge
on
some
element
of
a
crime
would
be
federal
constitutional
error.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
ordinarily
juries
don't
find
special
verdicts.
they
find
general
verdicts.
so
it
goes
back
to
the
question
of
what
a...
what
was
charged.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
is
your
answer
to
my
question?
would
this
affect
all
failures
to
charge
on
an
element
in
all
state
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you're
not
answering
my
question.
my
question
is,
would
this
affect
failures
to
charge,
the
failure
of
a
judge
to
charge
on
an
element
of
the
crime
in
all
state
cases?
chief
justice
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
rubinstein.
mr.
nuechterlein,
we'll
hear
from
you.
do
you
pronounce
your
name
nuechterlein
or
nuechterlein?
chief
justice
rehnquist
nuechterlein.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
nuechterlein,
when
i
practiced,
and
perhaps
things
have
changed,
when
a
judge
directed
a
verdict
he
sat
up
there
on
the
bench
and
told
the
jury,
now,
stand
up,
i'm
going
to...
you
know,
this
is
not
for
you
to
deliberate,
i'm
going
to
direct
you
how
to
return,
so
either
the
jury
was
handed
a
piece
of
paper
and
they
handed
it
back
and
did
exactly
what
the
judge...
that,
to
me,
was
the
judge
directing
a
verdict,
not
omitting
an
element
in
the
chart.
no
such
directed
verdict
took
place
here,
did
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
part
of
your
discussion
with
justice
breyer
i
think
is
fairly
academic.
i
mean,
if
there's
an
omission
of
a
central
part
of
the
charge,
whether
you
say
it's
never
subject
to
harmless
error
review
or
whether
you
say
it's
never
harmless
under
a
harmless
error
review
may
be
a
nice
question
for
academic
discussion,
but
it
comes
out
the
same
way.
chief
justice
rehnquist
we
have
an
interesting
little
colloquy
here,
because
it
seems
that
several
colleagues
of
mine
have
different
points
of
view
on
the
question
presented,
first
whether
there
was
really
error
here,
and
second
whether
it
was
really
an
admission
and,
of
course,
the
question
presented
is
whether
a
district
court's
failure
to
instruct
the
jury
on
an
element
of
an
offense
is
harmless
error
where
at
trial
the
defendant
admitted
that
element.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nuechterlein.
mr.
rubinstein,
you
have
about
a
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rubinstein.
the
case
is
submitted.
