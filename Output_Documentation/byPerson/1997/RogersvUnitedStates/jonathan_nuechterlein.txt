mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
it's
nuechterlein,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
in
this
case
is
not
whether
a
criminal
defendant
is
entitled
to
a
jury
instruction
on
every
element
of
his
offense.
he
is.
the
question
is
whether
a
defendant
is
entitled
to
an
appellate
remedy
if
the
district
court
erroneously
failed
to
instruct
the
jury
on
an
element
that
the
defendant
admitted
in
open
court.
in
this
case,
the
question
is,
at
bottom,
whether
petitioner
is
entitled
to
reversal
on
the
ground
that
the
jury
was
deprived
of
an
opportunity
to
find
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth
when
he
testified
under
oath
that
he
knew
that
a
silencer
was
a
silencer.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
he
did.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
the
question
is
ultimately
whether
he
was
subjected
to
some
kind
of
procedural
unfairness.
that
is
the
foundational
principle
of
the
court's
harmless
error
jurisprudence.
and
it's
one
thing
for
a
defendant
to
claim
that
he
has
been
subjected
to
procedural
unfairness
at
his
trial
if
the
jury
hasn't
been
given
an
adequate
opportunity
to
test
the
credibility
of
the
government's
evidence
on
some
issue,
but
it's
quite
another
thing
for
a
defendant
to
claim
that
his
trial
was
unfair
if
the
jury
wasn't
given
an
opportunity--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--well,
i
think
there
is
an
important
distinction,
justice
scalia,
between
a
total
and
a
partial
deprivation
of
any
constitutional
right.
for
example,
it
is
categorically
unfair
and
reversible
per
se
to
deny
someone
counsel
at
his
trial,
but
if
counsel's
appointed,
and
that
counsel
sleeps
through
nine-tenths
of
the
trial,
the
inquiry
then
becomes
whether
there's
been
some
particularized
unfairness
of
the
trial
as
a
result
of
the
counsel's
failure.
and
the
same
principle
is
applicable
here.
the
court
has
distinguished
between
total
deprivations
of
sixth
amendment
rights
and
partial
deprivations.
sullivan
itself
is
an
example
of
that.
in
sullivan,
it
was
held
to
be
categorically
reversible
if
there
is
no...
if
there's
no
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
on
any
of
the
elements,
but
by
contrast,
in
the
cases
where
this
court
has
addressed
burden
of
proof
errors
that
relate
only
to
individual
elements,
it
has
held
that
harmless
error
analysis
is
applicable.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
that
is
one
distinction,
but
there
is
also
another,
which
is
that
in
sullivan
the
error
spanned
the
entire
trial
and
affected
the
entire
jury
deliberations,
and
the
court
does
distinguish
between
total
and
partial
deprivations
of
a
sixth
amendment
right.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
the
failure
to
give
the
jury
an
instruction
on
the
staples
element.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
the
judge
should
have
said
that
you
must
find
that
the
defendant
knew
that
his
silencer
was
a
silencer.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
it
is
true
that--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--there
is
some
ambiguity
in
this
instruction.
we
have
proceeded
on
the
assumption
that
when
this
court
granted
cert
in
this
case
it
wanted
the
parties
to
brief
the
issues
on
the
question
presented,
which
is
whether,
if
there
is
an
omission
of
an
element
in
the
jury
instructions,
whether
that--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--well,
there
actually
was
similar
language
in
count
2
also,
but
the
difference
is
that
in
count
2
the
district
court
also
explicitly
said...
let
me
get
the
exact
language.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
right.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
think
we
have
assumed
for
the
purposes
of
this
case
that
he
did
request
that
instruction.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
no,
i
think
we
have
addressed
this
issue
by
giving
petitioner
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
this
was
an
ambiguous
instruction,
and
he
did...
if
you
read
through
the
colloquy
he
did
ask
for
what
appeared
to
be
the
staples
element,
and
the
district
court
did
deny
that
request.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
it
is
possible
to
construe
that
assumption...
it's
possible
to
construe
that
instruction
as
telling
the
jury
that
it
had
to
find
that
he
possessed
the
item
and
that
he
knew
that
he
possessed
the
item,
but
it
is
also
possible
for
the
jury,
given
his
subsequent
instruction,
to
find
that
he
was
telling
them
that
he
might
have
thought
that
the
item
was
a
pipe.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i'm
not
following
your
question.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--i
think
it
is
ambiguous,
and
we
have
briefed
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
he
was
denied
the
right
that
this
court--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--thought
he
was
denied
when
the
court
granted
certiorari.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
moats
was
not
an
instructional
error,
but
it
does
support
the
general
principle
that
a
defendant
is
uniquely
ill-positioned
to
claim
on
appeal
that
he
was
denied--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--i
don't
think
you
have
to
overrule
them,
but
what
you
do
have
to
do
is,
at
least
in
this
context,
curtail
the
principle
that
there
is
some
important
relationship
between
harmless
error
analysis
and
the
underlying
fairness
of
the
defendant's
trial.
again,
i
think
moats
does
support
the
general
point
that
a
defendant
is
uniquely
ill-positioned
to
be
claiming
on
appeal
that
his
trial
was
unfair
because
the
jury
was
given
an
inadequate
opportunity
to
find
that
he
was
lying
about
some
issue,
and
that's--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--that
was
my
answer.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
don't
think
i
do
agree
with
that
proposition.
i
think...
it
is
true
that
in
the
context
of
instructional
errors
in
a
typical
case,
it
is
the
appropriate
rule.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
the
error
had
an
effect
on
the
jury's
deliberations,
but
those
cases
all
dealt
with
contested
issues,
and
the
defendant's
claim
was
that
the
jury
wasn't
given
an
adequate
opportunity
to
assess
the
credibility
of
the
government's
evidence.
we
have
a
quite
different
case
here,
where
the
defendant's
claim
is
that
the
jury
wasn't
given
an
adequate
opportunity
to
find
that
he
had
lied,
in
effect,
about
the
element
that
he
admitted
under
oath.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
don't
think
that
this
case
would
be
different
if
there
had
been
a
directed
verdict
on
this
element
so
long
as
the
jury
was
able
to
assess
all
the
other
elements
that
he
did
not
admit
under
oath,
and
so
long
as
the
jury
played
an
essential
role,
but
the
important
point
is
this.
this
is
not--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--it
is
because
the
element
was
admitted,
and
i
think
the
important
point
is--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--admitted,
and
i
think
the
important
point
is
that
this
is--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--no.
i
think
that
that
is
different,
because
that
is
a
total
deprivation
of
his
right
to
a
jury
trial.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
think--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--so
long
as
the
jury
plays
an
essential
role
in
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--and
so
long
as
the
jury--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--i
think
the
public
perceives
that
the
jury
has
a
very
important
role
to
play.
if
he
admits
every
element
under
oath
and
the
jury
is
then
instructed
to
resolve
the
remaining
elements
that
he
has
not
admitted
under
oath,
it
is
error
not
to
let
the
jury
address
all
of
the
elements,
but
that
is
not
the
question
here.
the
question
is
whether
he
is
entitled
to
an
appellate
remedy
on
the
premise
that
the
jury
wasn't
given
an
opportunity
to
find
that
he
had
lied
under
oath--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--that
is
correct.
actually,
the...
there
have
been
directed
verdict
cases
where
this
court
has
upheld
convictions.
last
term's
johnson
decision
was
such
a
case.
but
even
in
the
harmless
error
context,
this
court
has
held
that
mandatory
conclusive
presumptions
can
be
harmless
error
if
certain
conditions
are
met.
there
is
no
substantive
difference
from
a
juror's
perspective
between
an
omission
of
an
element
and
a
mandatory
conclusive
presumption.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
but
i
think
that
that
finding,
justice
scalia,
is
an
empty
formalism,
because
the
jury
has
been
told
that
it
must
conclude
that
that
element
has
been
satisfied
if
it
finds
that
the
predicate
element
has
been
satisfied,
so
there
is...
from
a
juror's
perspective
there
is
absolutely
no
distinction
between
a
mandatory
conclusive
presumption
and
the
omission
that
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
that
is
not
it
at
all.
in
fact,
we
looked
at
the
instructions
very
carefully
and
we
made
the
determination
that
in
fact
the
element
was
not
instructed,
and
we
did
that
because
we
resolved
that
issue
and
there--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--no,
we
didn't
think
it
was
clear,
but
where
there
is
a
deep
ambiguity
and
the
jury
can
reasonably
construe
that
ambiguity
against
the
need
to
find
the
element,
we
thought
that
this
case
was
an
appropriate
vehicle
for
addressing
the
question
presented
the
petitioner
raised.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
in
the
ordinary
case
also
the
defendant
doesn't
admit
that
element.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
right.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
think
the
standard
is--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--if
the
defendant
admits
the
element
under
oath
then
the
jury
is
not
instructed
on
that
element.
that
is
not
structural
error.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
well,
i
think
that,
you
know,
justice
breyer,
is
a
total
deprivation
of
his
right
to
a
jury
trial,
and
again
i
think
that
is
distinct
from
the
sort
of
case
that
you
have
here.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--centrality
is
not
an
important
part
of
our
test.
what
is
important
is
that
the
jury
have...
play
a
role
in
the
determination
of
guilt
or
innocence,
and
if
the
jury
does
do
that
and
finds
every
element
of
the
offense
correctly
described
under
the
appropriate
burden
of
proof,
then
the
district
court's
failure
to
instruct
the
jury
on
an
element
that
the
defendant
admitted
under
oath
can
be
harmless
error.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
think
it
does,
and
the...
it
is
also
the
case
that
where
the
jury
has
not
addressed
an
issue
like
that
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
error
is
not
harmless.
in
fact,
i
would
imagine
that
is
the
case
in
almost
all
the
circumstances,
but
that's
not
what
we
have
here.
what
we
have
here
is
a
defendant
who
asked
the
jury
to
accept
his
statement
of
fact
with
respect
to
his
own
state
of
mind,
and
then,
on
appeal,
has
predicated
his
claim
for
reversal
on
the
premise
that
he
may
have
been
lying
when
he
told
the
jury
what
he
told
them.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
that
is
the
limiting
principle
on
our
general
theory
of
this
case,
but
that's--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--i...
again,
i
think
it
comes
down
to
your
question
of
procedural
fairness,
which
is
what
the
harmless
error
doctrine
is
all
about.
it's
one
thing
for
a
defendant
to
argue
that
his
trial
was
unfair
because
the
district
court
didn't
give
the
jury
enough
of
an
opportunity
to
assess
the
credibility
of
the
government's
evidence,
no
matter
how
compelling
that
evidence
may
seem
on
appeal,
but
it's
quite
another
thing
for
a
defendant
to
claim
that
his
trial
wasn't
fair
because
the
jury
didn't
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
find
that
his
trial
testimony,
an
issue
within
his
knowledge,
was
false.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
think
that
the
difference
is
with
respect
to
the
first
of
those
that
you
identified.
there
is
an
extremely
important
qualitative
difference
between
a
claim
that
the
jury
should
have
been
interposed
between
the
government's
proof
on
some
element
and
the
defendant.
that
is
very
different
from
the
circumstance
that
we
have
here,
where
the
defendant's
claim
is
that
the
district
court
should
have
interposed
a
jury
between
the
defendant
and
his
own
unequivocal
testimony.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
actually
think
that
a
defendant's
sworn
testimony
on
an
issue
within
his
peculiar
knowledge
should
be
more
binding
on
appeal
than
a
stipulation
would
be.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
what
he--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--his
account
of
why
he
knew
that
silencer
was
a
silencer
is
inconsistent
with
a
rational
jury's
determination
that--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--no,
we
do,
and
in
fact--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--it
is
a
precise
admission
of
that
element,
because
no
rational
juror...
and
one--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--the
defendant
did
admit
this
element.
the
fact
is,
what
he
told
the
jury
was,
i
knew
this
was
a
silencer
because
i
was
in
vietnam
and
i
depended
for
my
life
on
silencers.
i
knew
it
from
the
moment
that
i
saw
it,
which
was
in
his
claim
2
hours--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--no.
no,
he
claimed
he
knew
what
it
was
when
it
was
shown
to
him
right
after
his
arrest.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
yes.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
well,
i...
i
mean,
i
think
that
it
is
always
the
role
of
a
reviewing
court
to
determine
what
the
facts
of
the
case
are,
and
there
is
no
particular
impediment
in
determining
that
he
testified
about
some...
about
his
own
state
of
mind,
which
is
an
issue
within
his
peculiar
knowledge,
and
that
he
did
so
under
circumstances
where
there
was
no
question
about
whether
he
was
telling
the
truth.
in
other
words,
this
is
a
case
where,
if
his
admission
was
false,
it
was
knowingly
false.
if
it
was
false,
it
was
because
he
lied
on
the
stand
at
trial.
i
think
it's
also...
i
mean,
it's
significant
to
think
about
what
would
happen
if
this
trial
were...
if
in
fact
his
conviction
were
reversed
and
a
new
trial
ordered.
the
new
trial
would
not
be
about
this
element
at
all,
because
the
testimony
of
his
admission
here
would
be
introduced,
and
presumably
he
wouldn't
contest
it.
in
fact,
in
his
reply
brief,
he
alleges
that
this
is
an
essential
element
of
his
defense.
what
he
wants
is
a
new
trial
so
that
he
can
have
an...
a
second
bite
of
the
apple
on
all
of
the
elements
that
he
did
not
admit
under
oath
at
his
first
trial
and
that
the
jury
resolved
against
him
at
his
first
trial.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
does
the
government
concede--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--i
don't
think
that's
the
error.
no,
i
don't.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
i
had
understood
the
court
of
appeals
to
find
that
the
error
in
this
case
was
that
he
did
not
find...
that
the
district
court
did
not
instruct
the
jury
that
it
must
find
that
the
firearm
possessed
the
characteristics
that
made
it
a
firearm
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
yes,
that
he
knew
that.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
that
is--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--yes.
i...
is
your
question
whether
or
not
staples
applies
to
silencers
as
well
as--
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein
--the
error
in
this

the
district

the
jury
that
it
had
to
find...
i
guess
i'm
just
not
understanding
your
question.
it

that
the
silencer
was
a
silencer,
that
he
knew
the
silencer
possessed
the
characteristics
that
made
it
a
firearm
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
mr.
jonathan
e.
nuechterlein

how
i
understood
the
court
of
appeals
opinion.
