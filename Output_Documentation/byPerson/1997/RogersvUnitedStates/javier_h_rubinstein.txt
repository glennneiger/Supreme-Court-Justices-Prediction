mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
the
removal
of
an
element
by
the
trial
court
of
an
essential
element
of
the
crime
with
which
a
defendant
is
charged
from
the
jury's
consideration
is
the
type
of
error
that
can
be
subject
to
harmless
error
scrutiny
even
if
the
defendant
admitted
the
element
by
his
testimony.
we
urge
this
court
to
hold
that
it
is
not.
in
this
case,
it
is
undisputed
that
the
trial
court
completely
removed
from
the
jury's
consideration
an
element
of
the
offenses
with
which
petitioner
was
charged.
although
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
that
there
was
an
incomplete
verdict,
it
nonetheless
held
that
the
error
was
subject
to
harmless
error
scrutiny
because
the
trial
court
removed
only
one
element
of
the
offense.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
what
we
mean
is
that
the
jury...
what
the
jury
found,
the
elements
that
the
jury
found
do
not
constitute
a
crime,
that
the
jury
did
not
render
a
verdict
on
every
element.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
well,
in
the
sense
that
every
element
of
the
offense
charged
was
not
included.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that
is
true.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
yes,
except
that
it
was
done
in
the
context
of
jury
instructions
that
did
not
instruct
the
jury--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--our
contention
is
not
with
respect
to
the
actual
form.
it
is
with
respect
to
the
fact
that,
as
this
court
held
in
gaudin,
a
verdict
of
guilty
necessarily
means
a
verdict
that
the
defendant
is
guilty
of
every
element
of
the
crime
with
which
he
is
charged,
and
in
this
case
it
is
undisputed
that
the...
one
of
the
elements
of
that
crime
was
explicitly
removed
by
the
trial
court
from
the
jury's
consideration.
it
is
in
that
respect,
and
as
this
court
explained
in
gaudin,
without
an
element...
without
a
jury
finding
on
each
element
of
the
crime
with
which
the
defendant
is
charged,
there
is
no
verdict
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment,
and
if
there
is
no
verdict
within
the
meaning
of
the
sixth
amendment,
as
this
court
held
in
sullivan
there
is
no
object
upon
which
the
harmless
error
doctrine--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--yes,
it
was.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
actually,
in
our
view
the
error
in
this
case
provides
an
even
clearer
example
of
the
type
of
error
that
cannot
be
subject
to
harmless
error
scrutiny
than
was
present
in
sullivan.
as
the
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
sullivan,
at
least
in
that
case
the
jury,
there
could
be
room
for
some
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
the
defective
reasonable
doubt
instruction
impacted
the
jury's
deliberations,
whereas...
and
in
the
concurring
opinion,
your
honor
drew
a
distinction
with
the
case
in
which
an
element
is
explicitly
removed.
in
the
case
of
an
element
that
is
taken
away
from
the
jury,
there
is
no
room
for
speculation,
because
it
is
clear
that
the
jury
did
not,
in
fact,
render
a
complete
verdict
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
no,
no.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
yes.
it
is
the
element
of
mens
rea
that
this
court
required
in
staples
v.
united
states.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
of
an
unregistered
silencer.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
and
in
particular,
what
staples
would
require
in
combination
with
the
knowing
possession
requirement
is
that
the
defendant
must
knowingly
possess
an
object,
and
at
the
time
that
the
defendant
knowingly
possesses
it--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--if
the
trial
court
fails
to
instruct
the
jury
on
an
element
of
the
crime,
and
the
jury's
findings
on
the
other
elements
do
not
necessarily
encompass
the
element
that
was
omitted--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--in
that
particular--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--it
would
depend.
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
earlier
this
year
in
johnson
v.
united
states,
there
would
have
to
be
a
timely
objection
to
the
instruction.
in
other
words,
the
instructional
error
would
have
to
be
preserved
for
appellate
review
in
order
for
the
harmless
error
doctrine
to
even
be
potentially
applicable,
otherwise
the
plain
error
doctrine
would
apply
and,
as
this
court
held
in
johnson,
under
those
circumstances
the
analysis
would
be
quite
different,
so
in
our--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i
would
like
to
answer
your
question,
mr.
chief
justice,
in
two
ways.
first,
olano
presented
a
circumstance
in
which
there
was
no
objection
and
so
therefore,
as
this
court
held
in
johnson,
the
constitutional
objection
is
forfeit.
in
other
words,
the
analysis
is
entirely
governed
by
rule
52.
and
as
far
as
the
second
part
of
your
question,
though,
as
far
as
the
public
perception,
the
reason
why
reversal
is
required
when
an
element
is
omitted
from
the
trial
court's
instructions
and
where
there
is
a
contemporaneous
objection
to
the
instructional
error
is
because
it
is
the
right
to
the
jury
trial
itself
that
is
at
stake.
when
the...
and
in
addition
to
that,
what
is
also
at
stake
when
a
trial
court
removes
an
element
of
the
offense
charged,
as
occurred
in
this
case,
effectively
what
is
happening
is
that
the
trial
court
is
directing
a
verdict
in
favor
of
the
state
as
to
that
element.
it
is
taking
the
element
away
from
the
jury.
and
when
the
appellate
court,
as
occurred
in
this
case,
is
faced
with
the
removal
of
an
element,
and
decides
that
to
look
at
the
evidence
and
make
its
own
finding
as
to
whether
the
element
was
established
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
the
problem,
as
this
court
explained
in
sullivan,
is
that
the
wrong
entity
is
judging
the
defendant
guilty.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
if
the
jury
does
not
find
the
element
that
was
omitted--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--it
is
certainly
true
that
a
jury
generally
will
enter
a
general
verdict,
but
it
is
a
general
verdict
that
is
predicated
upon
the
jury's
instructions
that
tell
the
jury
what
the
elements
are.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
it
would
affect
state
cases,
but
it
would
only
do
so
if
the
jury
does
not
find
that
element.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
it
would
not.
it
would
only
apply
where
the
failure
is
a
complete
one,
where
the
jury's
findings
on
other
elements
do
not
embrace
the
element
that
was
omitted,
and
where
there
is
a
contemporaneous--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i'm
not.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
in
addition
to
the
type
of
error
that
we
are
dealing
with
in
this
case?
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
essentially
it
would
be
a
situation
where
the
right
to
the
jury
trial
itself
has
been
denied.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
as
far
as
i
am...
i
am
only
prepared
in
this
case
to
suggest
that...
and
i
realize
that
the
category
of
errors
that
this
court
has
regarded
as
essentially
being
immune
from
harmless
error
scrutiny
are
limited,
and
we
accept
that.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
yes,
it
is.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
and
the
reason
is
that
as
this
court
indicated,
for
instance,
in
estelle
v.
mcguire,
where
a
defendant
concedes
an
element,
the
prosecution's
burden
of
proof
remains
the
same,
and
where
a
defendant
admits
an
element
through
testimony
the
weight
of
that
testimony
is
for
the
jury
to
decide.
ultimately,
what--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--yes.
ultimately,
as
this
court
explained
in
duncan,
the
purpose
of
the
jury
trial
and
the
purpose...
is
to
ultimately
have
the
jury
pass
upon
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
i
would
say
the
answer
is
yes,
assuming
that
the
defendant
objects
to...
assuming
that
there
is
a
failure
to
instruct
on
the
interstate
commerce
element,
it
would
only
be
subject
to
the
rule
that
we
are
talking
about
if
the
defendant
timely
objects
to
the
trial
court's
failure
to
instruct
on
that
element,
and--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i
would
think
so.
to
give
an
example
of
entrapment,
the
burden
of
production
that
would
be
necessary
on
the
part
of
the
defendant
to
trigger
the
defendant's
entitlement
to
a
defense
instruction
like
entrapment
would
be
subject
to
appellate
review.
but
if
an
appellate
court
concludes
that
the
burden
of
production
was
satisfied
and
that
the
defendant
did
have
a
right
to
have
the
instruction
given
to
the
jury,
it
would
not
be
within
the
power
of
the
appellate
court
to
declare
the
omission
of
that
instruction
harmless
because
the
appellate
court
has
reviewed
the
evidence
and
decided
that,
in
fact,
no
reasonable
jury
would
have
found
that
entrapment
existed.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
that
apparently
is
an
open
question
within
the
circuits,
and
i
know
that
there
is...
it
is
a
conflict
right
now
as
to
whether
or
not
a
defendant
can
partially
plead
guilty.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
if
it
were
permissible
to
plead
to
an
element
in
accordance
with
rule
11,
and
all
of
the
normal
safeguards
are
provided
to
the
defendant,
that
the
defendant
is
waiving
his
or
her
right
to
a
jury
trial
as
to
that
element,
and
if
such
a
plea
were
permissible,
i
think
that
since
we
are
talking
about
it--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways.
first
of
all,
this
court
has
said
that
even
where
an
open
concession
is
made
on
an
element,
that
that
does
not
reduce
the
prosecution's
burden
of
proof.
in
fact,
even
where
a
defendant
stipulates--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--absolutely
not,
and
i
did
not
mean
to
concede--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--absolutely,
and
it
is
our
position
that
if
the
defendant
pleads
not
guilty,
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
defendant
concedes
an
element.
it
would
make
no
difference
if
the
defendant
openly
confessed
on
the
stand
that
he
or
she
committed
the
crime.
the
government
concedes
in
its
brief
that
if
a
defendant
were
to
break
down
on
the
stand
and
openly
concede
guilt
of
the
crime
it
would
not
be
harmless
for
the
judge
to
discharge
the
jury
and
enter
a
judgment
of
conviction.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
it
would
depend...
if
the
jury
could
not
have
found
the
elements
of...
on
one
count
without
also
finding--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--let
me
rephrase
that.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
in
that
case
the
jury
will
have
found
that
the
defendant
knowingly
possessed
an
item
that
he
knew
to
be
a
silencer.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
in
that
context,
and
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
pope
is
instructive
on
that,
that
if
the
jury
could
not...
if
the
jury
actually
did
make
the
finding
of
fact
that
would
be
necessary
to
establish
guilt
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--right.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
yes,
i
understand
that,
but
if
no
rational
jury
could
have
found
what
they
did
find
as
to
count
2
and
not
find
it
at
the
same
time
as
to
count
1--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--yes.
well,
in
that
particular
instance,
at
the
very
least
the
court
would
have...
the
appellate
court
would
have
actual
jury
findings
that
it
can
rely
on,
and
it
would...
at
least
will
have
the
confidence
of
knowing
that
the
jury
had
to
decide
whether
the
defendant...
and
all
of
the
elements,
whether
the
defendant
knowingly
possessed
an
item
that
he
knew
to
be
a
silencer.
here,
we
have
no
such
finding,
because--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the
particular
jury
instruction
that
was
given
is
at
page
104,
and
it
is
the
instruction
from
the
trial
court
that
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
item
described
in
the
indictment
was
a
firearm,
which
the
law
requires.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
what
that
instruction
means
is
that
the
defendant
must
knowingly
possess
an
object
which
the
law
defines
as
a
firearm.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
defendant
has
to
know
the
characteristics
of
the
item
that
make
it
a
firearm.
that
was
the
basis
for
this
court's
holding
in
staples.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
actually--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--i
think
you
do,
and--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--all
of
the
circuits
that
have
considered
the
question
have
held
that
staples
does
apply
to
silencer
possession
offenses,
the
seventh
circuit
and
the
ninth
circuit
both.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
i'll
give
you
an
example.
the...
a
silencer
as
i
understand
it
looks
very
similar
to
a
flash
suppressor,
which
is
also
an
item
that
is
attached
to
a
gun.
a
flash
suppressor
is
not
subject
to
registration
requirements.
it
is
not
defined
as
a
firearm,
and
the
two
objects
can
look
highly
similar.
and
so
it
is
possible,
and
particularly
when
the
silencer
is
not
attached
to
the
weapon
itself
it
is
not
necessarily
clear
that
someone
will
know
that
the
cylinder
that
they
have
is
a
silencer.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
let
me
answer
your
question,
justice
breyer,
in
two
steps.
first,
with
respect
to
the
instructions
themselves
it
was
conceded
by
the
government
in
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
element
required
by
staples
was
explicitly
removed.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
what
they
conceded
was
that
it
was
removed.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
i
would
take
issue
that
it
is
ambiguous.
in
my
reading
of
the
instruction
the
trial
court
told
the
jury
that
it
didn't...
that
the
government
did
not
have
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
the
characteristics
of
the
item
that
made
it
a
firearm--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--under
the
law.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
at
page...
at
page
104
the
government...
i
mean,
sorry,
the
judge
said,
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
that
the
item
described
in
the
indictment
was
a
firearm
which
the
law
requires
to
be
registered.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
and
when
the
defendant's
counsel
objected,
he
objected
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove,
otherwise
the
counsel
was
concerned
that
the
element,
without
that
element,
that
a
jury
might
be
inclined
to
believe,
as
this
court
was
concerned
in
staples,
that
simply
knowing
possession
of
the
object
itself
was
enough
to
convict.
ultimately...
and
the
court
of
appeals
also
held
that
the
element
was
explicitly
removed
and
ultimately,
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
every
conviction
involving
an
ambiguous
instruction
would
be
subject
to
reversal,
ultimately
it
will
be
for
the
court
to
decide
whether
or
not,
based
on
the
review
of
the
instructions
themselves,
whether
the
element
in
fact
was
omitted
or
not
and,
in
light
of
this
court's
decision
in
johnson,
it
would
be
incumbent
upon
defense
counsel
to
object
on
the
grounds
that--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--it
had
been
omitted.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
to
answer
your
question,
i
believe
that
the
fact
that
petitioner's
counsel
is...
or
the
defense
counsel
is
obligated
to
object,
and
that
ultimately
it
is
for
the
appellate
court
to
decide
whether
the
element
has
been
omitted,
provides
the
safeguard
that
would
prevent
all
ambiguous
instructions
from
being
subject.
it
does
provide
the
appellate
court
with
a
way
of
knowing
that
the
omission
was
perceived
at
the
trial
court
level
and
was
brought
to
the
trial
court's
attention,
and
the
trial
court
passed
upon
the
objection,
but--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the
government
never--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--the
government
has
not
taken
that
position.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
government
stated
explicitly
at
page
10
of
its
appellate
brief
that
the
element
required
by
staples
was
explicit--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--they
also
confessed
error
with
respect
to
the
machine
gun
count
as
well,
and
ultimately,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
the
question
presented
assumes
that
in
fact
the
element
was
omitted.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
and
it
is
not
our
contention
that
it
would
never
be
harmless
error.
it
would
only
be
where
the
omission
is
a
true
one,
and
where
the
jury's
findings
on
other
elements
do
not
necessarily
embrace
the
omitted
element
and,
finally,
where
there
is
a
contemporaneous
objection
and
where
it
is
brought
to
the
trial
court's
attention
and
the
trial
court
has
an
opportunity
to
consider
whether
the
element
has
been
omitted
or
not.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
what
we
have...
what
we
believe
to
be
the
case
is
that
he
did
admit
that
when
he
was
shown
the
object
he
could
identify
it
as
a
silencer.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
we're
not
suggesting
that
he...
that
petitioner
had
to
know
it
had
to
be
registered.
that
is
not
our
contention.
and
ultimately,
based
upon
the
way
the
question
presented--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--right.
we...
we
have
accepted
the
court's
premise
in
adopting
the
government's
question
that
he
admitted...
that
his
admission
was
coextensive
with
the
element.
with
the
court's
permission,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
yes.
what
that
charge
was
that...
it
charged
knowing
possession
as
an
element.
it
did
not
charge
that
the
defendant
had
to
know
at
the
time
of
possession
the
characteristics
of
the
item
that
made
it
a
firearm,
which
is
what
this
court
held
is
also
required.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
correct,
and
in
this
case--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--right.
you
have
to
know
the
characteristics
that
make
it
a
firearm.
in
this
case,
all
that
would
have
to
be
proven--
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
--all
right,
and
in
this
case
what
that
would...
staples
would
require
is
that
the
person
knew
it
was,
in
fact,
a
silencer.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
what
i
believe
the
instruction
states
at
the
bottom
of
page
4
is
that
the
defendant
knowingly
possessed
the
item
charged,
which
is
described,
and
then
that
it
was
a
firearm.
he
does
not
have
to
find...
and
ultimately
the
judge
removed
from
the
jury's
consideration
the
element
that
the
defendant
had
to
know
the
characteristics,
or
in
this
particular
case
that
the
defendant
had
to
know
it
was
a
silencer.
mr.
javier
h.
rubinstein
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
pointing
to
the
same
passage
that
justice
thomas
just
read
from,
the
court
of
appeals
did
find,
as
a
predicate
to
its
opinion,
that
the
element
in
this
case
was
omitted
from
the
trial
court's
instructions.
and
at
page
10
of
the
government's
brief
in
the
court
of
appeals
it
said
that
the
instruction
did
not
pass
post
staples
muster
insofar
as
it
explicitly
withdrew
from
the
jury's
consideration
the
issue
of
appellant's
knowledge
that
the
firearm
he
possessed
fell
within
the
statutory
definition.
