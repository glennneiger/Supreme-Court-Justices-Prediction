justice
breyer
well,
you
might
think
it's
a
grenade
launcher.
[laughter]
right?
but
if
that's
so,
i
don't
understand...
i
really
don't
understand
this.
as
i
read
these
instructions
it
seemed
to
me
that
they
did
instruct
the
jury
that
the
jury
is
supposed
to
find
exactly
what
staples
says
they're
supposed
to
find.
at
most,
it's
ambiguous.
what
the
first
thing
is,
jury,
you
have
to
find
that
the
defendant
knowingly
possessed
a
firearm
as
defined
above.
well,
that's
right.
that's
what
we
said
in
staples.
you
have
to
know
that
the
machine
gun
is
that
kind
of
thing
which
the
statute
is
talking
about,
not
a
soap
box
derby
racer.
it's
a
thing
that
looks
like
this,
that
has...
et
cetera,
and
the
defendant
has
to
know
that,
and
they
just
said
you
have
to
know
it.
and
then,
on
the
other
instruction,
it
says
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
prove
that
the
defendant
knew
the
item
described
in
the
indictment
was
a
firearm
which
the
law
requires
to
be
registered.
in
other
words,
that's
ambiguous,
but
it's
certainly
able...
and
my
natural
reading
is,
defendant,
you
don't
have
to
know
that
that
thing,
which
you
do
know
is
the
very
thing
described
in
section
5845,
you
do
not
have
to
know
the
fact
that
there's
a
statute
called
5845
which
makes
it
illegal
to
possess
it.
now,
that's
a
natural
meaning
of
that.
now,
given
that,
what
we
have
here
is
not
an
omission.
what
we
have
is
an
instruction
that
is
ambiguous
as
to
whether
or
not
it
does
or
does
not
tell
the
jury
what
we
said
in
staples
was
an
element.
therefore,
if
you
are
right,
every
ambiguous
instruction
ever
given
by
any
judge
in
the
united
states
legal
system
is
suddenly
going
to
be
absolutely
unreviewable
for
harmless
error,
and
that,
of
course,
seems
like
quite
a
far-reaching
proposition.
justice
breyer
did
not
concede
that
it
was
not
ambiguous.
justice
breyer
fine,
and
i
say,
you
can
say
that
if
you're
prepared
to
say
that
the
reason
it
was
removed
is
because
the
instruction
was
capable
of
two
possible
understandings.
justice
breyer
what
are
the
words
that
do
that?
justice
breyer
what
are
the
words
that
do
that?
justice
breyer
which
the
law
requires
to
be
registered.
justice
breyer
that's...
that's
the
very--
justice
breyer
--you've
now
put
your
finger
on
just
the
point
that's
bothering
me.
this
is
exactly
difficult
to
understand
what
those
words
mean.
as
i
read
them
first
i
thought
they
just
meant
the
jury
doesn't
have
to
decide
whether
the
defendant
knew
there's
a
statute
that
makes
it
illegal.
as
you
read
it,
you
thought
it
meant
something
different,
namely
that
the
element's
missing,
and
what
worries
me
is
if
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
says
in
respect
to
that
kind
of
instruction
it
can
never
be
harmless
error,
then
aren't
we
saying
it
virtually
in
respect
to
all
instructions,
or
thousands,
or
tens
of
thousands,
and
courts
all
over
the
place
will
have
to
start
reviewing.
that's--
--mr.
rubinstein,
i
didn't
think
this
question
was
in
this
case.
let
him
answer
justice
breyer's
question.
then
you--
justice
breyer
still,
if
that...
i
mean,
i'd
worry
about
lawyers
reading
an
opinion
that
upheld
you
in
light
of
the
instruction
that
was
actually
given,
and
even
if
that
weren't
so,
i'm
still
worried
about
my
basic
problem,
finding
something
in
the
constitution
that
says
that
this
kind
of
ambiguity,
or
something
a
little
less
ambiguous,
could
never
be
harmless
error.
that's...
why
would
the
constitution
say
that?
that's--
justice
breyer
but
that
might
be
redundant,
and
certainly
what
justice
thomas
just
read
doesn't
even
seem
ambiguous.
he
says,
what
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
that
the
defendant
knowingly
possessed...
knowingly
possessed
the
item
as
charged.
what
was
charged
is
that
he
possessed
a
9-inch
by
1-3/4
silencer.
therefore,
he
told
the
jury,
jury,
you
must
find
the
defendant
knowingly
possessed
a
9-inch
by
1-3/4
silencer.
that's
what
he
told
them.
now,
what
else
was
he
supposed
to
say,
other
than
that?
justice
breyer
so
in
other
words,
if
you
charge
the
defendant
with
robbing
a
federally
insured
bank,
or
with
robbing
a
bank,
you
also
have
to
instruct
and
by
the
way,
you
know
that
a
bank
is
a
bank.
he
had
to
know
that
it
was
a
bank.
you
have
to
tell
the
jury
he
didn't
think
it
was
a
grocery
store.
justice
breyer
mr.
nuechterlein--
--can
i
ask--
--no.
well,
if
we
go
to
the
merits
of
it;
and
say
totally...
which
i'm
not
sure,
you
know.
i
mean,
this
ambiguity
is
a
slight
problem,
but
the
question,
the
sort
of
deep...
the
question
i
have
on
the
merits
is,
imagine
that
you
do
fail
to
charge
on
an
element.
you
fail
to
let
the
jury
decide
whether
the
person
who
is
the
bank
robber
used
a
threat,
or
force.
well,
i
would
think
in
such
a
case
it
couldn't
be
harmless,
that
the
guts
of
the
crime
weren't...
don't
you
agree
with
that?
justice
breyer
so
if
you
have
a
murder
case
and
you
forget
to
say
that
they
have
to
find
that
there
was
a
victim,
you
see,
i
mean,
that
would
seem
a
serious
problem.
justice
breyer
so
you
agree
in
that
case.
all
right.
then
there
are
only
three
possibilities.
one
is,
you
don't
agree
and
it's
never...
you
always
look
for
harmless
error.
the
second
possibility
is
that
if
it's
an
element
of
the
offense
that's
omitted,
it's
never
harmless
error,
and
the
third
possibility
is
something
in
between,
where
you
don't
think
the
first
two,
so
you
must
think
something
in
between,
and
as
to
when
the
omission
of
the
element
is,
per
se,
bad,
no
matter
if
it's
harmless,
and
when
it
isn't.
now,
the
only
standard
that
i've
been
able
to
find
that
might
do
it
is,
you'd
look
to
olano,
which
is
a
different
context,
and
you'd
say,
it
is
harm...
you
can't
look
for
harmless
error.
it's
per
se
harmful.
it's
structural...
if
it
seriously
affects
the
fairness,
integrity,
or
public
reputation
of
judicial
proceedings.
otherwise,
you
look
to
see
if
it's
harmless.
i
don't
know
if
that's
a
good
standard.
i
know
we
need
some
standard
if
we're
not
going
to
take
either
extreme,
and
so
i'm
asking
you
what
the
standard
is.
justice
breyer
that
one
or
some
other.
justice
breyer
well,
even
if
he...
in
other
words,
if
he
admits,
under
oath,
i
murdered
the
victim,
and
what
the
judge
does
is
walk
in
and
say
to
the
jury,
jury,
is
the
defendant
guilty
or
not
guilty,
and
the
jury
says,
of
what,
they
think
to
themselves.
huh,
i
won't
tell
you.
[laughter]
justice
breyer
but
then
you're
not
agreeing
with
proposition
1
that...
you're
saying
that...
you're
saying
there
is
no
omission,
no
omission
of
an
element.
justice
breyer
that
wouldn't
be
subject
to
harmless
error
no
matter
how
central
the
element
if
a
person
admits
it.
justice
breyer
i
think
he
knew
that.
