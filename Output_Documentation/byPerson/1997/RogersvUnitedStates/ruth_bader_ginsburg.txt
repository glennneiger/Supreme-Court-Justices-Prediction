justice
ginsburg
mr.
rubinstein,
you're
not
making
any
distinction
between
federal
trials
and
state
trials.
justice
ginsburg
so
whatever
the
rule
is
for
the
federal
trials
you're
saying,
whatever
you're
arguing
here
in
the
federal
trial
would
apply
to
the
state
trial
as
well.
you
mentioned
that
this
is
an
example
of
a
type
of
error
that
is
incurable,
and
the
standard
categories,
the
person
who
is
without
counsel,
the
biased
judge,
and
now
you
say
the
failure
to
instruct
on
an
element
when
there's
a
request
for
the
instruction.
what
else
belongs
in
that
category
of
incurable
errors?
justice
ginsburg
yes.
justice
ginsburg
yes,
well,
if
you
could
be
specific
about
that,
and
i
gave
the
two
standard
ones
and
added
the
one
you're
urging.
is
there
anything
else,
or
is
that
it?
justice
ginsburg
--mr.
rubinstein,
on
the
admission,
i
wasn't
clear
whether
you
were
saying
the
admission
wasn't
even
a
flat
out
admission.
were
you
suggesting
that
he
said,
yes,
yes,
it's
a
silencer,
i
know
it's
a
silencer,
but
not
saying
that
he
knew
a
silencer
was
a
firearm
that
federal
law
prohibited?
justice
ginsburg
i
mean,
you
could
say
about
a
gun,
but
a
silencer
is...
you
might
think,
oh,
yeah,
there's
a
gun
registration
law,
guns
have
to
be
registered,
but
you
wouldn't
automatically
say
that
about
an
accoutrement.
justice
ginsburg
well,
what
did
he...
what
are
you
contending
he
did
have
to
know?
in
other
words,
you
are
conceding
that
what
he
said
he
knew
is
all
that
is
required
to...
for
the
government
to
prove
that
he
knew.
the
only
thing
is,
the
element
didn't
go
to
the
jury.
justice
ginsburg
that
it
was
a
directed
verdict,
i
mean,
that's
the
strongest...
to
put
their
case
in
the
strongest
terms,
you
can't
direct
a
verdict
in
a
criminal
case,
and
the
way
you
have
agreed
that
this
case
is
shaped
presents
that
question.
you
said
yes,
there
was
a
missing
instruction
on
an
essential
element,
but
he
admitted
that
element,
not
at
a
plea
hearing
or
anything
like
that,
and
so
pro
tanto
there
is
a
directed
verdict.
now,
that's
the
case
that
you
agreed
is
presented
here.
i
think
maybe
from
the
charge
it...
you
should
not
have
made
that
agreement,
but
you
did,
so
can
a
trial
judge
direct
a
verdict
on
an
element
in
a
criminal
case
on
the
basis
that
the
defendant
has
admitted
it
but
hasn't
waived
his
right
to
a
jury
trial?
justice
ginsburg
you're
saying
his
admission
was,
if
i
had
that,
i
knew
what
it
was.
it
was
a
lawyer's
admission,
wasn't
it?
[laughter]
mr.
nuechterlein,
before
you
conclude,
you
say
admission,
and
there
are
admissions
and
admissions.
this
one
looked
like
it
was
very
forthright
and
repeated,
but
sometimes
a
defendant
can
admit
something
when
he's
testifying
from
the
stand.
when
he
finishes
he
says,
oh
my
gosh,
i
never
should
have
admitted
that.
so
the
admission
comes
in
many
sizes
and
shapes,
and
how,
if
we
adopt
your
rule,
do
we
guard
against
the
possibility
that
a
defendant
will
be
trapped
by
an
inadvertent
admission?
