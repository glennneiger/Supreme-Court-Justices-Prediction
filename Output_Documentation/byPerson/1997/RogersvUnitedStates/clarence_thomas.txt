justice
thomas
--mr.
rubinstein.
let's
go
back
to
page
104
of
the
joint
appendix.
i'm
having
a
similar
problem,
a
problem
similar
to
justice
breyer.
it
says
here
at
the
bottom,
what
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
that
the
defendant
knowingly
possessed
the
item
as
charged.
now,
what
was
that
item,
as
charged?
justice
thomas
that's
not
what
we
held
in
staples.
what
we
held
in
staples
is
that
he
had
to
know
that
the
machine
gun,
or
the
gun
that
he
had
could
be
converted...
had
the
characteristics
of
a
machine
gun.
justice
thomas
not
that
it
was
a
firearm.
justice
thomas
no,
no,
the
characteristics
that
make
it
a
machine
gun.
justice
thomas
well,
the
item
as
charged,
what
i
don't
understand
is
that,
what
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
that
the
defendant
knowingly
possessed
the
item
as
charged.
the
item
as
charged
was
that...
is
that
a
9-inch
by
1/3/4
inch
silencer?
justice
thomas
mr.
nuechterlein,
just
a
couple
of
clarifications.
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion,
the
court
of
appeals
says,
as
discussed
above
the
district
court,
over
defense
objection,
refused
to
inform
the
jury
that
the
government
had
the
burden
of
showing
rogers
knew
the
item
in
questions
were
firearms
under
the
act.
in
the
question
presented
in
this
case,
in
the
cert
petition,
the
petitioner
says
that
the
trial
court,
over
the
objection
of
the
defense
counsel,
the
timely
objection
of
defense
counsel,
refused
to
instruct
the
jury
that
the
government
as
an
element
of
the
offense
charged
was
required
to
prove
that
petitioner
knew
the
item
in
question
was
a
firearm
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
now,
does
the
government
concede
that
the
failure
to
object
that
the
silencer
was
a
firearm
is
an
error?
justice
thomas
that
the
failure
to
instruct
that
the
silencer
was
a
firearm
is
an
error?
justice
thomas
that's
the
error
that
the
court
of
appeals
found.
justice
thomas
so
your
answer
is,
the
government
does
not
concede
that
the
failure
to
give
a
particular
instruction
was
in
error.
justice
thomas
that
that
was--
--no,
that's...
my
question
is...
this
is
from
the
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
you...
that
the...
as
discussed
above,
the
district
court,
over
defense
objection,
refused
to
inform
the
jury
that
the
government
had
the
burden
of
showing
rogers
knew
the
items
in
question
were
firearms
under
the
act.
with
the
benefit
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion
is
staples,
we
can
now
indubitably
state
that
the
district
court's
action
effectively
omitted
the
instruction
an...
from
the
instruction
an
essential
element
of
the
crime.
justice
thomas
no,
whether
staples
requires
that
there
be
an
instruction
that
the
silencer
was
a...
that
he
knowingly
possessed
a
firearm
under
the
act.
not
a
silencer,
a
firearm.
justice
thomas
and
you
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
says
that
in
this
opinion?
