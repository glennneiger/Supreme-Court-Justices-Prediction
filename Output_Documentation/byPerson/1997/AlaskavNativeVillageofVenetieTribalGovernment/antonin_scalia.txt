might
gaming
be
a
big
matter
that's
up
for
grabs
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
gaming
in
justice
o'connor's
sense.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
did...
it
seems
to
me
you
should
not
concede
that
it
created
the
status
quo
ante,
because
the
status
quo
ante
was
that
the
government
owned
those
lands.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
there's
no
way...
and
they
tried
to
get
it
back
to
the
government,
didn't
they?
they
tried
to
get
the
interior
department
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--to
accept
it
in
trust
for
the
indians,
and
the
interior
department
refused.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
roberts,
is
there
any
other
indian
country
where
the
land
in
question
is
owned
by
the
indians
and
not
held
in
trust
by
the
government?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
kendall,
what
do
you
do
with
section
1601(b),
in
which
ancsa
said
that
it's
purpose
was
to
convey
the
land
to
the
indian
people
with
maximum
participation
by
natives
in
decisions
affecting
their
rights
and
property
without
establishing
any
permanently
racially
defined
institutions,
rights,
privileges,
or
obligations,
and
without
creating
a
reservation
system
or
lengthy
wardship
or
trusteeship?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
say
to
get
them
out
of
their
control.
that's
the
whole
definition
of
what's
indian
country,
whether
they're
within
the
control,
wardship,
and
trusteeship
of
the
government.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
quite
in...
it
seems
to
me
incompatible
to
say
that
you
want
to
get
them
out
of
the
control
and
yet
you
still
want
it
to
be
indian
country.
justice
antonin
scalia
dependency.
dependency
to
the
federal
government,
which
is
what
you're
just
telling
me
they
were
trying
to
eliminate.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
buy
the
pueblo
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what...
it
can...
can
it
enact
legislation
pertaining
to
those
lands
any
more...
any
more...
what
should
i
say,
intrusively
than
it
can
legislation
pertaining
to
state
lands?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
can
displace
state
law--
justice
antonin
scalia
--despite
what's
said
in
the
act,
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
how
is
it
in
a
politically
dependent
relationship?
what
does
the
federal
government
do
with
regard
to
the
inhabitants
of
venetie
that
it
could
not
do
with
respect
to
the
inhabitants
of
peoria?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
aside
from
giving
benefits,
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
was
talking
about
dependence.
in
what
ways
are...
is
venetie
dependent
upon
the
federal
government,
subservient
to
the
federal
government
to
a
degree
that
the
citizens
of
peoria
are
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
just
means
it
gets
benefits
that
peoria
don't
get.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
dependency.
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
kendall,
could
i...
look
on
page
17a
of
your
appendix.
i
asked
you
earlier
about
1601(b),
and
you...
which
says,
without
establishing
any
permanent
racially
defined
institutions,
rights,
privileges,
or
any
lengthy
wardship,
and
you
explained
that
by
saying,
well,
that
just
says
we
weren't
creating
any.
it
doesn't
say
they
were
not
preserving
any.
but
turn
the
page
and
look
at
18a,
subsection
(c),
which
is
sort
of
a
proviso,
you
know,
what
isn't
changed.
no
provision
of
this
chapter
shall
replace
or
diminish.
you
would
expect
to
be
in
there,
you
know,
any
dependency
status
of
any
indian
tribes.
it
has
nothing
like
that.
it
says,
shall
diminish
any
right,
privilege,
or
obligation
of
natives,
as
citizens
of
the
united
states,
or
as
of...
or
of
alaska,
or
relieve,
replace,
or
diminish
obligation
of
the
state
of
alaska
to
protect
the
rights
or
welfare
of
the
natives
as
citizens
of
the
united
states
and
alaska.
the
whole
thing
just
reeks
with
the
very
opposite
philosophy
from
the
one
that
you're
espousing,
that
the
government
wanted
to
preserve
native
identity.
justice
antonin
scalia
--thought
it
would
have
been
in
this
preservation
provision
if
it
was
intended
to
be
preserved.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
need
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
need
to
be
there,
but
one
would
expect
to
find
it
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
could
it
footnote
that
if
it
wasn't
published?
that's
not
very
useful,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
sort
of
been
smuggled
out.
[laughter]
