justice
david
h.
souter
so
isn't
the
really
crucial
point
that
there
is
no
control?
i
mean,
i
suppose
that
within
the
meaning
of
the
formula
that
we
used
that
you've
been
quoting,
the
validly-set-aside-subject-to-superintendence,
and
so
on,
that
i
suppose
if
the
statute
had
said,
and
if
any
of
this
land
is
reconveyed
by
these
corporations
to
the
tribes
that
originally
owned
them,
they
will
be
subject
to
the
same
superintendence
which
we
have
traditionally
been
able
to
exercise.
i
suppose--
justice
david
h.
souter
--there
would
be
a
fair
argument
then
to
say,
okay,
it
has
reverted
to
indian
country
status,
but
that's
not
the
case
here.
justice
david
h.
souter
is
there
a
third
possibility?
is
there
any
way
that
congress
at
this
point
could
designate
certain
areas
as
a
reservation?
justice
david
h.
souter
right.
they're
subject...
and
they're
subject,
presumably,
on
your
theory
to
state
jurisdiction.
can
congress
take
that
back?
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
let's
assume
the
landowners
were
willing.
as
against
the
state,
could
congress
take
that
back?
justice
david
h.
souter
and
impose
reservation
status.
i--
justice
david
h.
souter
well,
but
wasn't
something
more
accomplished,
and
that
was,
once
the
title
had
changed,
as
i
understand
it
there
was
no
limitation
on
what
the
then
titleholder
could
do.
as
you
answered,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
the
titleholder
could
have
conveyed
it
to
me,
in
which
case
it
would
no
longer,
as
you've
conceded,
been
indian
country.
now,
isn't
it
true
that
the
titleholder
had
completely
free
rein
once
title
was
received?
justice
david
h.
souter
--let
me
go
back
to,
i
think
an
earlier
point,
and
that
is,
i
had
been
reading
the
requirement
of
subsection
(b),
or
i'm
reading
subsection
(b)
as
intending
to
codify
that
definition
of
the
indian
country
which
has
been
referred
to
already.
i...
we
used
it
in
citizen
band
potawatomi,
but
i
think
it
goes
back
to
1914,
the
definition
validly
set
apart
for
the
use
if
indians
as
such
under
superintendence
of
the
government,
and
the
difficulty
that
i'm
having
with
your
position,
if
i
am
correct
that
these
should
be
read
in
the
light
of
that
traditional
definition,
is
that
even
conceding
that
there
may
have
been
some
protection
provided
on
a
continuing
basis,
the
fact
that
the
land
was
so
readily
alienable,
unconditionally
alienable,
seems
to
me
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
superintendence
requirement
which
i
am
assuming
is
part
of
(b).
am
i
right
that
it
is
inconsistent
with
the
superintendence
requirement,
and
am
i
right
that
(b)
should
be
read
in
the
light
of
this
traditional
definition?
justice
david
h.
souter
if
that's
a
valid
way
to
read
(b)...
i
guess
you're
telling
me
it's
not
a
valid
way
to
read--
justice
david
h.
souter
--it's
not
an
express
requirement,
is
that--
justice
david
h.
souter
--is
that
right?
but
if
it
was
intended
to
codify
the
language
we've
used
in
our
cases,
then
it
would
include
superintendence.
are
you
saying
it
wasn't
intended
to
codify
the
language
in
our
cases?
justice
david
h.
souter
now,
what
does
the
superintendence
consist
of,
then?
if
superintendence
does
not
imply
a
right
to
preclude
alienation,
what
does
the
superintendence
consist
of
traditionally,
and
what
does
it
consist
of
in
this
case?
justice
david
h.
souter
--oh,
but
indian
land,
as
well
as
indian
affairs?
justice
david
h.
souter
i
mean,
what's
bothering
me
is,
what
does
fee
ownership
mean,
then?
justice
david
h.
souter
protections
and
restrictions?
in
other
words--
justice
david
h.
souter
--in
other
words,
are
the
holders,
the
native
alaskan
holders,
or
the
tribal
holders
of
that
land,
subject
to
restrictions
on
what
they
can
do
with
it
while
they
keep
it
which
would
not
be
restrictions
imposable
upon
a
non-native
owner?
justice
david
h.
souter
but
doesn't
superintendence
imply
control
as
well,
perhaps,
as
protection?
justice
david
h.
souter
could
the
federal
government
come
along
today,
pass
a...
could
congress
pass
a
statute
and
say
today,
binding
upon
this
tribe,
saying
you
shall
take
no
muskrat
upon
your
land?
