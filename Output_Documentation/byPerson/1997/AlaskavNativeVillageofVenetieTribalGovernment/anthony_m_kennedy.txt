but
most
of
the
land
that
was
conveyed
was
not
indian
country
under
the
then-prevailing
jurisprudence.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
is
your
principal
argument
based
on
the
fact
that
there's
no
community,
or
that
there's
no
dependent
community,
because
that's
the
phrase.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
does
that...
the
dependent
community
status
remain
if
the
tribe
moves
to
a
different
area,
so
they
bring
that
indian
country
designation
to
a
new
area
if
they
choose
to
move?
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
ms.
kendall--
--so
you...
so...
just
to
follow
this...
so
you
do
submit
that
there
is
a
territorial
aspect
to
the
jurisdiction
that's
in
question
here.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
this
is
necessarily
part
of
the
dependent
indian--
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
--community
definition.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
and
yet
that
seems
somewhat
inconsistent
with
the
theory
of
the
act,
which
was
to
change
territorial
designation.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
oh,
estates.
i
thought
you
said
states.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
i
think
that's
the
problem.
yes.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
it
remains
a
recognized
tribe.
justice
anthony
m.
kennedy
do
you
agree
that
dependency
means,
dependent
on
the
government
for
protection
of
your
tribal
status?
