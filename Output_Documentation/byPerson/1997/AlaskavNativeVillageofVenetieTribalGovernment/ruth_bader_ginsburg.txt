can
you
give
us
an
example
of
what
other
comparable
population
villages
can
do,
non-indian
villages,
in
the
way
of
taxing
power,
because
it
would
be
kind
of
an
academic
exercise
to
bring
this
case
all
the
way
here
if
their
claim
to
this
tax
didn't
depend
on
their
sovereignty
claim,
unlike
other
cities
or
villages.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
it's
useful
to
know,
and
i
certainly
would
like
to
know
what
that
means.
the
label,
indian
country,
apparently,
if
it's
proper,
would
allow
this
tax,
so
what
else
is
gained
by
having
the
label,
indian
country?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
at
least
some
of
the
friends
of
the
court
told
us
not
to
worry
because
in
fact
alaska,
even
if
this
village
is
indian
country,
can
regulate
hunting
and
fishing,
and
that
actually
there
would
not
be
these
large
consequences.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
would
you
just
explain
to
me
what
benefit
a
tribe
would
have,
then,
from
making
the
1618(b)
election,
where
they
don't
get
any
money,
and
they
just...
just
give
us
the
reservation
that
we
had
before?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
you
mentioned
the
department
of
interior.
we
don't
have...
that
has...
the
report
didn't
become
an
official
report,
or
the
1993
report.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
do
we
have
a...
any
statement
in
this
case
of
the
current
views
of
the
united
states?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
mr.
roberts,
this
is
the
first
time
that
i
participated
in
a
case
involving
tribal
lands
where
we
haven't
heard
from
the
united
states,
and
i
thought
that
that
was
extraordinary,
but
maybe
they
sometimes
appear
and
sometimes
don't.
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
the
ninth
circuit
ruling
is
quite
broad.
we
have
at
least
one
of
your
friends
that
tells
us,
this
should
be
restricted
to
the...
what,
is
it
six
tribes
that
are
like
the
venetie,
the...
who
made
the
1618(b)
election,
and
it
doesn't...
the
coverage
of
the
entire
ancsa,
is
that
what
you
call
the
legislation,
that's
wrong.
one
of
the
briefs
took
that
position.
what
is
your
view
on
that?
justice
ruth
bader
ginsburg
but
you
are
saying
that
whether
it's
1618(a)
or
(b),
your
argument
is
it's
still
all...
it
all
can
be
indian
country.
