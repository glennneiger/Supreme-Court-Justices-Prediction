but
it
is
true,
isn't
it,
that
no
matter...
if
we
mix
it
up
and
get
it
all
wrong,
congress
can
always
straighten
it
all
out,
either
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
of
course
the
statute
did
settle
a
huge
dispute
over
aboriginal
title,
didn't
it?
it
put
an
end
to
that
whole
controversy
of
who
owned
the
lands.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
can
make
sense
out
of
the
statute
even
if
you
don't
think
it
went
quite
as
far
as
you
think
it
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
gave
them
away
in
exchange
for
a
total
surrender
of
any
aboriginal
claims.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
it's
not
exactly
a...
totally...
you
know,
not
a
total
gift.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
interrupt
you.
i
can
understand
your
point
about
the...
from
the
point
of
view
of
the
tribe,
a
vast
difference
between
being
part
of
the
state
government
at
a
municipal
level
and
being
an
independent
tribe,
but
would
you
help
me
on
this
one
point.
if
you're
correct
that
when
they
terminated
the
reservation
they
remained
indian
country
and
therefore
have
all
the
prerogatives
of
running
their
own
affairs,
what
is
the
significant
difference
between
that
and
still
being
a
reservation?
in
other
words,
what
did
congress
accomplish
by
making
this
change
in
status?
justice
john
paul
stevens
could
they
not
have
done
that
and
allowed
the
reservation
to
survive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
could
they
not
have
accomplished
all
the
other
objectives
and
not
terminated
the
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
see,
the
thing
that
runs
through
my
mind,
and
it
may
not
be
correct,
that
they
must
have
had
a
reason
for
terminating
the
reservation.
it
seems
to
me
whatever
that
reason
was
might
equally
apply
to
their
decision
that
you
should
not
retain
indian
country
status.
