ms.

venetie.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
venetie
was
indian
country
in
1971,
and
nothing
in
ancsa
changed
that.
the
petitioner
here
argues
otherwise.
the
question
here
is
not
whether
congress
created
indian
country
in
1971,
but
whether
congress
clearly
terminated
venetie's
existing
indian
country
status,
and
we
submit
that
it
did
not,
for
nothing
in
ancsa
refers
to
indian
country,
to
dependent
indian
communities,
or
even
cites
to
the
indian
country
statute.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
that
is
correct.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
your
honor,
1151(b)
includes
three
categories
of
indian
country,
reservations,
dependent
indian
communities,
and
allotments,
and
although
it
is
true
that
ancsa
eliminated
venetie's
reservation
status--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--as
a
basis
for
indian
country--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--under
1151(b),
ancsa
expressly
left
in
place
indian
country
in
the
form
of
over
10,000
native
allotments
under
section
1617,
and
native
allotments
are
per
se
indian
country
under
1151(c),
so
congress
clearly
did
not
abolish
all
forms
of
indian
country
through
that
particular
provision.
1618(a)
must
be
read
in
context
with
1618(b).
1618's
revocation
of
the
venetie
reservation
was
done
to
be
able
to
convey
full
fee
title
of
those
very
same
lands
to
the
venetie
tribe
under
1618(b).
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
yes,
justice
scalia.
that
particular
provision
speaks
to
the
creation
of
a
wardship,
but
it
doesn't
speak
to
the
ongoing
relationship
that
existed,
and
it
is
true
that
congress,
through
that
particular
provision,
announced
in
its
policy
that
it
was
going
to
adopt
a
new
approach
to
indian
affairs
through
ancsa,
and
that
was
one
that
would
disavow
the
reservation
system.
the
reservation
system
is
one
in
which
the
federal
government
owns
the
lands,
and
has
ultimate
control
over
the
decisions
with
respect
to
development
of
those
lands.
keep
in
mind
at
the
time
that
ancsa
was
passed
the
average
income
of
alaska
natives
was
less
than
1,200
dollars
per
year.
they
lived
in
dire
poverty,
and
it
was
viewed
to
be
necessary
to
be
able
to
develop
some
kind
of
economic
vehicle
to
help
the
native
people
come
into
the
mainstream,
economic
mainstream.
that
was
the
purpose,
to
get
the
villages
out
from
underneath
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs'
control.
oftentimes
on
reservations,
when
resources
are
developed,
the
money
goes
into
a
trust
fund
for
the
native
beneficiaries,
and
they
never
see
that
money.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
i
disagree.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
your
honor,
section
16...
i
mean,
1151(b),
the
category
that
covers
the
indian
communities,
that
particular
category
does
not
turn
on
lands
being
in
federal
ownership.
it
turns
on
a
community
that
is
under
the
protection
and
guardianship
of
the
federal
government,
and
that's
what
we
have
today
with
respect
to
venetie.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
not
the
dependency,
the
bia
control
over
development
issues
of
their
land.
the
dependency
relationship
stayed
intact
and
in
fact
was
confirmed
by
the
congress
in
the
1994
federally
recognized
tribal
list
act,
where
congress
expressly
reaffirmed
its
ongoing
relationship
to
all
federally
recognized
tribes,
including
venetie,
and
that
fact
fundamentally
undermines
all
of
petitioner's
arguments,
because
from
that
flows
two
important
points,
the
first
that
the
continuing
guardianship
means
that
congress
as
a
trustee
cannot
terminate
something
as
important
as
rights
that
venetie
possessed
before
1971
without
expressly
saying
so.
second,
the
guardianship
relationship
goes
to
two
of
the
important
components
necessary
to
establish
venetie's
character
as
a
dependent
indian
community.
you
need
both
a
tribe
that's
under
federal
protection,
and
you
need
an
area
that
is
occupied
by
a
dependent...
by
a
tribe
under
federal
guardianship.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
it's
not
our
position,
justice
kennedy,
that
a
tribe
can
unilaterally
create
indian
country,
but
if
a...
the
federal
government
treats
with
and
recognizes
and
deals
with
a
particular
indian
community
as
indian
country,
as
being
under
its
federal
guardianship
and
protection,
then
that
area
has
been
found
to
be
a
dependent
indian
community.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
i
agree,
your
honor,
that
1151
focuses
on
land
and
on
territory,
areas
that
are
occupied,
but
1151(b)--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--indian
community--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
that
congress--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--it
did
not
change
territorial
designation.
what
it...
congress
did
do
was
it
extinguished
aboriginal
claims.
those
claims
were
based
upon
much
broader
areas
than
what,
in
fact,
the
villages
did
receive,
and
in
venetie's
case,
although
petitioner
suggests
that
they
received
something
less,
what
they
received
was
their
full
fee
title
to
the
very
lands
that
they
had
occupied
prior,
and
that
had
been
set
aside
for
them
prior
to
1971.
nothing
changed
except
for
a
change
in
title.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
no,
i
do
not
think
that
federal
recognition
in
just
services
is
sufficient.
federal
recognition
does
supply
the
dependent
relationship
that's
necessary
for
the
tribal
relationship.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
they
likewise
have
to--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--treat
the
area
that
the
tribe
occupies
as
being
an
area
that
is
the
residence
of
tribal
indians
under
federal
protection,
and
that
is
present
with
venetie.
although
petitioner
argues
that
there
are
no
controls
over
these
particular
lands,
there
are
certainly
many
federal
protections.
ancsa
through
section
6--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--well,
i
would
submit--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--that
would
be
a
fact
that
is
not
present
here,
but--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--i
would
submit
that
that,
depending
on
the
nature
of
the
case
and
the
facts
involved
there,
that
that
would
likely
not
qualify
as
indian
country,
but
here,
where
you
have
a
case
like
venetie,
who
owns
the
total,
the
land
base
that
it
occupied
prior
to--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--congressional
intent,
yes.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
that
is
true.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
that
is
true.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
if
i
may,
your
honor,
congress
fully
knew
that
it
was
conveying
the
lands
to
the
venetie
residents
even
if
it
was
doing
so
through
the
corporation.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
under
the
act,
it
was
the
villages
that
were
found
eligible
and
entitled
to
receive
lands.
only
after
the
villages
were
found
entitled
by
the
secretary
to
receive
lands,
then
were
the
corporations
established
to
hold
and
manage
those
lands
for
and
on
behalf
of
the
villages.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
yes,
they
were.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
but
if
i
can
direct
your
attention
to
1618(b)
in
our
brief,
in
appendix
63a,
that
provision
says--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--63a
in
our
appendix.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
if
you
look
up
on
the
top
of
the
page
at
63a,
it
says,
estates
in
any
reserve
set
aside
for
the
use
or
benefit
of
its
stockholders
or
members--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--63a
of
the
appendix.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
63a.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
excuse
me.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
estates
in
any
reserve
set
aside
for
the
use
or
benefit
of
its
stockholders
or
members
prior
to
december
18,
1971.
now,
one
more
provision,
if
you
will,
please,
on
page
105a
of
our
appendix.
that
is
provision
1641(b)(3).
if
you
go
down
towards,
lower
than
the
middle
of
the
paragraph,
it
says,
again,
estates
in
a
reserve
as
such
reserve
existed
on
december
18,
1971,
which
was
set
aside
for
the
use
or
benefit
of
the
stockholders
or
members
of
such
corporation
before
december
18,
1971.
now,
i
think
the
only
fair
reading
of
those
two
provisions
is
that
congress
clearly
understood
that
the
very
lands
that
they
were
conveying
to
a
corporation
were
the
same
lands
that
had
been
conveyed
and
are
set
aside
for
the
venetie
residence
before
that
date.
all
that
was
occurring
here
was
a
change
in
title
to
the
corporations
which
were
identical
to
the
tribal
residence.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
the
titleholder
does
have
free
rein
in
terms
of
the
alienability
aspect
of
the
land,
but
until
those
lands
leave
indian
ownership
they
are
treated
by
congress
as
being
under
federal
protections
for
purposes
against
state
taxation,
against
foreclosure,
against
a
judgment,
creditors,
against
even
the
involuntary
dissolution--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--of
the
corporations.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
no.
if
i
can
take
the
(b)
question
first,
what
you
refer
to,
a
reference
to
land
set-aside
under
superintendence
of
indians,
that
particular
term
has
been
used
in
the
context
primarily
of
cases
that
examine
lands
that
are
or
continue
to
be
held
in
federal
ownership
or
trust
status.
that
hasn't
been
the
touchstone
for
determining
cases
that
have
been
treated
as
indian
country,
for
instance
in
the
sandoval
case.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
i'm
saying
that
under
the
statutory
test
it's
not
one
of
the
requirements
based
on
just
a
plain
reading--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--it's
not
express
requirement.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
no,
it
was,
and
i
am
saying
that
superintendence
is
an
important
element,
and
let
me
just
back
up
and
say,
alienability
does
not
eliminate
federal
superintendence.
petitioner
was
wrong
in
saying
sandoval
in
the
pueblo
lands
were
subject
to,
or
didn't
have
any
restrictions
other
than
those
imposed
by
congress.
sandoval's
lands,
i
mean,
the
pueblo
lands
are
alienable,
as
this
court
held
in
1987
in
the
case,
mountain
states
telephone
company
v.
pueblo
santa
ana.
in
that
case,
this
court
upheld
the
alienability
of
the
pueblo
lands,
so
alienability
in
and
of
itself
is
not
sufficient
to--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--that's
correct,
without
the
consent
of
the
united
states.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
the
key
to
understanding
superintendence
is
that
the
federal
government
retains
its
plenary
authority
to
enact
protective
legislation
over
indian
lands.
that's
superintendence,
and
that
is
present
in
spades
here,
because
congress
has
retained
the
authority
to
enact
protective
legislation
over
ancsa
lands
and
has
repeatedly
come
back,
in
the
course
of
over
29
amendments,
to
strengthen
the
nature
and--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--absolutely,
your
honor.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
yes,
it
can.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
yes,
it
can,
your
honor.
congress
has
plenary
authority
over
indian
affairs,
and
based
upon
that
plenary
authority--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--indian
land.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
fee
ownership
means
that
congress
has
allowed
natives
to
make
a
determination
for
themselves
when
and
if
to
alienate
their
lands,
but
until
that
land
is
out,
removed
out
of
native
ownership,
it
continues
to
retain
the
protections
that
federal
government
has
imposed
upon
them.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
and--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--they
are
not
subject
to
restrictions.
they
are
subject
to
protections,
and
federal
protections
that
have
protected
those
lands
from
loss
to
third
parties
and
to
the
state.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
i
don't
believe
so,
justice
souter.
but
again,
superintendence
refers
to
congress'
retained
plenary
authority
to
enact
protective
legislation
over
the
lands.
it
does
not
refer
to
control,
and
there
is
nothing
in
section
1151(b)
that
has
that
requirement.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
well,
that
is
true
and,
in
fact,
that's
what
we
have
here.
venetie
is
a
federally
recognized
tribe.
it
is
in
a
politically
dependent
relationship
with
the
federal
government,
and
the
federal
government
has
emphasized
its
authority
to
enact
legislation
pertaining
to
venetie's
lands.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
very
much,
your
honor.
federal
recognition
refers
to
the
fact--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--it
refers
to
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
recognized
the
venetie
tribal
government
as
being
a
tribal
government,
one
that
has
all
inherent
powers
that
have
not
been
expressly
terminated
by
congress.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
the
venetie
as
a
federally
recognized
tribe
is
dependent
because
it
can
depend
on
the
federal
government
to
protect
its
interests.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
it's
much,
much
more
than
that.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
it
has
all
the
privileges
and
immunities
as
federally
recognized
tribes.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
that's...
that
is
true,
and
that--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--it
could
do
so
if
it
were
to
choose
to
do
so,
but
that
would
be--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--it
would
indeed.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
but
that
would
be
an
act
of
assimilation.
venetie
is
a
federally
recognized
tribe,
and
it
has
been
governing
its
own
community
and
its
own
affairs
since
time
immemorial.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
it
would
give
up
its
culture.
it
would
be
assimilated
into
the
state,
and
it
would
for...
it
would
relinquish...
it
would
be
forced
to
relinquish
its
viable
native
governing
entity
that
it
has
utilized,
and
is
an
entity
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
federal
government
as
existing,
and
that
is
entitled
to
all
the
same
benefits
and
protections
as
other
federally
recognized
tribes.
a
municipal
government
is
not
one
that
is
necessarily
compatible
with
decisionmaking
of
tribal
governments.
the
venetie
people
make
their
decisions
by
consensus,
by
looking
to
their
tribal
elders,
by
sitting
down
together
and
conferring
upon
the
problems.
a
municipal
government
has
a
code
that's
300
pages
long,
that
they
have
to
nominate
people
to
sit
on
the
board,
and
it's
a
totally
alien
form
of
government.
the
venetie
tribal
government
is
one
that
has
been
recognized
by
the
united
states.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
none,
your
honor.
what
they
accomplished
was
conveyance
of
faulty
title
to
the
venetie
residents.
what
venetie
had
prior
to
then
was
unrecognized
title.
they
possessed...
this
reservation
had
been
set
aside
for
their
exclusive
use
and
benefit,
but
this
reservation,
as
the
secretarial
reservation,
was
not
one
that
had
recognized
title,
so
their
aboriginal
title
was
still
unprotected.
what
congress
accomplished
was
to
recognize
their
aboriginal
title
and
vest
full
fee
in
the
tribe
itself.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
and
allow...
and
that...
well,
what
they
did
is,
they
allowed
indian
country
to
survive
as--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--they
could
have
made
a
policy
choice
not
to
revoke
reservations,
but
it
was--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--well,
your
honor,
again
i
think
that
within
the
legislative
history,
to
the
extent
that
you
want
to
look
there,
what
you
will
find
is
a
lot
of
discussion
about
how
the
reservation
system
was
viewed
as
being
a
failure
by
both
the
congress
and
the
indians
themselves.
the
indians
did
not
want
to
be
under
a
system
in
which
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
was
to
make
day-to-day
decisions
over
how
to
run
their
lives.
they
wanted
to
be
able
to
make
those
decisions
for
themselves.
the
act
itself
was
passed
during...
as
the
era
of
self-determination
without
termination,
the
current
policy
period
of
which
we
still
are
in,
and
this
era
of
self-determination
without
termination,
congress
has
enacted
other
statutes
like
ancsa,
like
the
indian
self-determination
act,
in
which
they
are
basically
telling
the
tribes,
take
control
of
the
bia.
we're
going
to
dismantle
it
all
together,
and
you
control
the
bia.
you
provide
whatever
governing
services
that
the
bia
otherwise
did,
but
we
will
not
consider
that
as
a
termination
of
your
tribal
status.

one
change.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
there's
only
one
change,
and
that
is
that
the
lands
are
not
held
in
trust
by
the
federal
government,
but
that
is
not
a
requirement
under
1151(b).
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
no
change.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
no,
change,
absolutely
no
change.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
the
guardianship
role,
federal
protections,
everything
still--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--it's
the
federal
government
and
the
indian
tribe,
the
venetie
indian
tribe
that
does
all
that,
that
carries
out
governmental
functions
within
its
community.
it
did
before,
and
it
has
continued
to
do
so
afterwards.
your
honors--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--what
you
don't
find
here
is
language
of
termination.
you
find
nothing
that
says,
we
are
terminating
your
rights
as
indian
people
or
federally
recognized
tribes.
there
is
nothing
here
in
that
language
that
says
that.
what
you
see
here
is
language
that
says--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--it
doesn't
need
to
be
in
preservation.
the
statutory--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--the
requirement
is
that
termination
must
be
by
clear
and
express
language
of
congressional
intent,
and
that's
not
what
you
find
in
ancsa.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
let
me
ask
you,
your
honor--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
--excuse
me.
[laughter]
let
me--
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
my
view
is
that
to
the
extent
that
they
have
similar
facts
to
venetie
i
think
that
they
probably
have
the
stronger
claim,
because
of
the
express
language
in
the
statute
that
i
pointed
out
that
says
lands
set
aside
for
the
corporation.
as
justice
o'connor
said
in
sac
and
fox,
indian
country
consists
of
lands
that
had
been
set
aside
by
any
means
for
the
benefit
of
indians
under
federal
protection.
ms.
heather
r.
kendall
it...
well,
it
would
depend
on
the
facts
of
the
particular
community,
i
would
submit,
and
in...
as
far
as
venetie
is
going,
evidence
was
presented
at
trial
by
both
sides
of
the
case,
and
the
district
court
found,
based
upon
these
uncontested
findings,
that
venetie
was
a
dependent
indian
community
as
of
1971,
and
nothing
in
ancsa
changed
that,
and
we
ask
this
court
not
to
read
into
ancsa's
silence
an
intent
that
was
not
there.
congress,
in
passing
that
statute,
attempted
to
construct
a
fair
and
honorable
settlement,
and
it
would
not
be
fair
or
honorable
to
read
into
the
statute--
