mr.
john
g.

venetie,
venetie.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1971
congress
settled
native
alaskan
land
claims
by
passing
the
alaska
native
claims
settlement
act.
that
act
revoked
all
reservations
in
alaska
save
one,
and
extinguished
all
claims
based
on
aboriginal
title.
in
exchange,
it
conveyed
to
state-chartered
corporations
owned
by
individual
native
shareholders
1
billion
dollars
and
44
million
acres
of
land
in
fee
simple,
land
which
because
a
freely
alienable
asset
of
the
corporations
to
do
with
as
they
see
fit.
the
ninth
circuit
nonetheless
held
that
the
settlement
lands
at
issue
in
this
case
were
indian
country,
a
jurisdictional
concept
epitomized
by
the
reservation
and
characterized
by
land
held
in
trust
or
otherwise
controlled
by
the
federal
government.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
it's
often
the
case
that--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
because
congress
in
1971
had
no
reason
to
suppose
that
there
was
any
such
indian
country
in
alaska.
that
had
been
the
nearly
uniform
decision
of
alaskan
courts
that
had
looked
at
the
question,
and
at
the
time,
yes,
there
were
a
handful
of
reservations
that
were--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--there
were
reservations,
and
they
were
revoked,
so
to
the
extent
there
was
indian
country
that
they
would
be
aware
of,
they
took
action
very
expressly
to
extinguish
it.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
that's
correct
and,
in
fact,
it
was
not
indian
country
under
the
accepted
concept
as
it
had
developed
in
the
lower
48.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
in
fact
many--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--venetie
has
not
done
so.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
could,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
would
have
the
same
authority.
there
is,
in
fact,
a
restriction
in
the
alaska
constitution
that
says
the
only
local
entities
who
may
tax
are
cities
and
boroughs.
that's
one
reason
the
indian
country
determination
is
so
important,
because
in
the
absence
of
indian
country
that
constitutional
provision
would
apply,
and
in--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no.
if
it
were--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--incorporated
as
a
borough--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--or
as
a
city
it
would
be
eligible.
if
it
were
not--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
would
have
the
same
taxing
powers
as
other
villages.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
there
may...
i
think
there
are
other
restrictions.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
other
municipalities.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
there
are
restrictions
on
the
extent
to
which
they
can
tax,
but
their
powers
would
be
the
same.
now--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
think
their
authority
to
tax
does
depend
on
their
sovereignty.
now,
of
course,
the
question
that
was
decided
below,
and
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari,
was
not
directly
the
validity
or
nonvalidity
of
the
tax.
it
was...
the
case
is
here
in
an
interlocutory
posture.
it's
the
ruling
on
indian
country,
which
is
very
pertinent
in
assessing
whether
or
not
the
tax
is
valid.
that
was
the
way
the
case
has
been
litigated
throughout,
and
the
question
that
was
presented.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
it
has
broad
jurisdictional
significance.
if
land
is
indian
country,
we
start
with
the
presumption
that
tribal
and
federal
jurisdiction
controls,
and
that
state
jurisdiction
is
generally
displaced.
if
land
is
not
indian
country,
state
jurisdiction
applies
as
it
does
in
other
areas,
so
it
has
significance
not
only
with
respect
to
taxes
but
to
environmental
regulation,
hunting
and
fishing,
gaming
regulation,
health
and
safety
regulation,
a
broad
range
of
day-to-day
regulation.
it
answers
the
basic
question,
who
is
in
charge?
if
it's
indian
country,
characterized
throughout
the
country
by
the
reservation,
you
know
that
the
tribal
government
has
sovereign
authority
and
the
federal
government
also
has
sovereign
authority.
if
it's
not
indian
country,
state
law
applies
as
it
does
generally
throughout.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
i
think
that's...
certainly
on
a
case-by-case
basis
whether
a
particular
regulation
can
be
applied
in
indian
country
or
not
is
a
determination
that
would
have
to
be
made
on
the
particular
facts,
but
if
you
take
a
case
like
new
mexico
v.
the
mescalero
tribe,
there
the
court
held
that
state
gaming
laws
did
not
apply
in
that
indian
country.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
yes,
hunting--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
appreciate
that.
yes,
i...
hunting
and
fishing,
but,
of
course,
the
same
with
respect
to
gambling,
and
the
reason
you
have
that
is
because
the
normal
state
rules
do
not
apply
in
indian
country.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
hunting
and
fishing--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--hunting
and
fishing
is.
gaming,
it
could
be,
although
it
doesn't
look
like
an
attractive
location
for
a
big
casino.
[laughter]
but
other
basic
elements
like
environmental
regulation,
what
type
of
development
can
take
place,
the
broad
question
of
state
regulation,
a
determination
of
whether
it's
indian
country
establishes
who,
at
least
as
an
initial
matter,
is
in
charge.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yes.
congress
has
plenary
authority
over
indian
country,
and
we
think
when
it
exercised
authority
in
ancsa
to
settle
aboriginal
claims,
it
took
a
course
of
action
fundamentally
inconsistent
with
indian
country.
the
reservation
is
the
prototypical--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
then
it
has
the
power
it
has
over
other
lands,
because
the
key
fact
of
ancsa
is
that
these
settlement
lands
were
given
away
free
and
clear,
in
fee
simple.
they
were
made
freely
alienable
property
of
the
corporations
to
which
they
were
given.
the
federal
government
did
not
retain
control.
that
is
the
defining
characteristic
that
makes
it
clear
that
this
is
not
indian
country.
this
is
not...
the
test
that
this
court
has
articulated
is
that
indian
country
is
land
set
apart
for
the
use
of
the
indians
as
such,
under
the
superintendence
of
the
federal
government.
these
lands
were
not
set
aside
for
anyone's
use.
they
were
given...
we're
done
with
it,
free
and
clear.
the
corporations
can
do
with
them
as
they
see
fit,
and
have.
they've
transferred
the
lands,
they've
sold
the
lands,
developed
it
in
different
ways.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
we
think
that
it...
in
giving
the
lands
away
free
and
clear
congress
intended
somehow
to
also
set
them
aside--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
no,
it
wasn't
a...
it
wasn't
a
gift
at
all,
but
my
point
was
they
retained
no
control
over
the
land,
and
in
every
case
in
which
this
court
has
found
indian
country
the
lands
have
either
been
within
the
boundaries
of
a
reservation,
or
otherwise
subject
to
federal
control.
this
would
be
the
first
instance
in
which
the
court
has
found
indian
country
where
the
federal
government
retained
no
control,
and
if
you
think
about
it,
the
concept
of
indian
country
is
inconsistent
with
the
relinquishment
of
control,
under
the
superintendence
of
the
federal
government,
how--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that,
of
course,
is
mcgowan.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
yes,
but
not
simply
because
they
revoked
the
reservations
but
because,
for
example,--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--other
reasons.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
you're
referring
to
the
reconveyance--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
reconveyance
of
the
land--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--the
reason
is
that
the
decision
to
create
indian
country
is
up
to
congress.
it's
not
up,
as
in
this
case,
to
the
two
ancsa
corporations
that
received
the
land
under--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
and
that's--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--that's
the
critical
point.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
and
it
is
also
the
clearest
evidence
that
the
federal
government
had
relinquished
its
control
and
had
no
control
over
the
decision
of
the
ancsa
corporations
that
received
the
lands
that
used
to
be
the
venetie
reservation.
they
elected
of
their
own
free
will
to
turn
it
back,
6
years
later,
to
the
tribal
government.
that
is
not
the
act
of
the
federal
government
establishing
indian
country,
and,
of
course,
it
doesn't
incorporate
any
notion
of
retained
federal
control.
it's
a
unilateral--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
that's
right,
as
did
the
reservation--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--what
they
did--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--because
it
would
have
been,
they
explained,
inconsistent
with
ancsa.
they
actually--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
they
could--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it's
not
the
case.
the
government
doesn't
retain
control,
and
the
government
didn't
participate
in
the
process.
this
was
a
particular
finding
by
the
district
court
and
also
by
the
department
of
interior
in
its
opinion
on
this
subject,
that
this
was
a
unilateral
act
of
the
corporations
not
approved
and
not
joined
in
in
any
way
by
the
government.
it
doesn't
reestablish
federal
control
that
existed
when
the
reservation
was
in
place.
and
it's
not
just
the
revocation
of
the
reservation
that
makes
it
clear
that
ancsa
is
inconsistent
with
indian
country.
there
are
other
provisions
throughout.
congress
said
that
it
wanted
to
settle
claims
without
creating...
without
adding
to
the
categories
of
property
entitled
to
special
tax
privileges.
indian
country
is
entitled
to
special
tax
privileges.
it's
generally
exempt
from
state
taxes.
congress--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
they
get
a
lot
more
land.
there
are
two
ways
that
venetie
could
have
elected
to
receive
benefits
under
the
act
the
way
most
other
villages
did,
which
gives...
has
a
formula
based
on
population
that
says
you
get
so
many
acres
or,
under
1618(b),
they
could
take
title
to
the
former
reservation
and
get
the
1.8
million
acres,
and
they
get
both
the
surface
and
the
subsurface.
if
they'd
elected
the
other
option
they
would
have
title
just
to
the
surface,
and
the
regional
corporation
under
ancsa
would
have
title
to
the
subsurface,
so
they
got
a
great
deal
more
by
pursuing
that
option
and,
as
was
explained
by
the
department
of
the
interior,
when
they
refused
to
take
the
land
back
in
trust,
that
this
was
simply
another
way
to
calculate
your
benefits.
it
is
not
a
way,
as
the
ninth
circuit
viewed
it,
to
opt
out
of
the
act,
and
it
doesn't
have
a
consequence
of
reestablishing
indian
country.
now,
venetie
wanted
to
avoid
this
from
the
beginning.
when
ancsa
was
being
deliberated
they
had
a
proposal,
let
us
keep
the
reservation.
it
was
not
enacted.
the
only
reservation
that
was
kept
was
metlakatla,
which
was
a
special
historical
situation,
and
then,
as
indicated,
in
1978,
i
believe,
they
came
back
and
said,
all
right,
we've
got
this
land.
we
want
you,
the
government,
to
take
it
back
and
hold
it
in
trust,
and
the
interior
department
refused.
they
said
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
ancsa.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
the
answer
is
yes
and
no.
yes,
in
a
technical
sense.
sandoval,
which
involved
the
pueblos.
the
pueblos
owned
the
land
in
fee.
however,
in
the
beginning,
when
the
united
states
took
jurisdiction
from
the
king
of
spain,
that
title
has
been
circumscribed.
the
statute
specified
that
that
land
was
under
the
absolute
jurisdiction
and
control
of
the
congress
of
the
united
states,
so
while
they
technically
have
fee
title,
congress
retains
control,
and
that's
the
critical
element
in
the
establishment
of
indian
country.
i'm
aware
of
no
other
case,
no
case
where
the
government
doesn't
have
control
over
the
land,
which
is
necessary
if
they're
going
to
assume
the
obligation
of
superintendence
with
the
displacement
of
state
authority,
and
that's
why
the
court
has
emphasized
that
it's
critical
to
focus
on
the
intent
of
congress.
when
indian
country
is
established,
the
most
typical
way
is
by
establishing
a
reservation
providing
for
allotments.
congress
specifically
designates
the
area
that's
to
be
covered.
that
is
also
true
with
respect
to
the
only
two
cases
outside
of
the
reservation
or
allotment
categories
where
this
court
has
found
indian
country,
sandoval
and
mcgowan.
in
sandoval,
the
court,
this
court
did
not
consider
a
range
of
factors
to
see
if
they
added
up
to
some
abstract
concept
of
indian
country.
congress
said
in
the
statute,
this
land
is
indian
country,
land
owned
by
the
pueblos,
and
so,
too,
in
mcgowan,
the
colony
case
that
justice
breyer
was
mentioning.
there,
congress
set
it
up
owned
by
the
federal
government,
in
trust
for
specific
indians
from
throughout
nevada.
the
respondents
would
shift
to
a
much
more
amorphous
and
more
expansive
concept
of
indian
country.
they
ask
whether
the
area
has
a
uniquely
indian
character,
whether
it
is
a
distinctly
indian
community.
they
don't
quite
bring
themselves
to
adopt
the
ninth
circuit's
test,
which
is
six
factors
to
be
weighed
in
an
amorphous
way
to
come
to
that
conclusion.
those
tests,
that
approach
would
effectively
shift
the
responsibility
for
defining
and
designating
indian
country
from
congress
to
the
courts.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
the
areas
that
would
be
likely
candidates,
i
suppose,
have
been
given
away
as
part
of
the
settlement.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not,
probably,
without
paying
the
landowners
in
the
first
place,
because
it's
privately
held
land.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
i
think
they--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--could
if...
again,
that
was
the
issue
in
sandoval.
could
congress
designate
this
area
as
indian
country.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
no.
i
think
as
with
respect
to
the
private
landowners
they
would
have
to
do
that
by
arrangement
with
the
state
if
the
state
agreed
to
it,
and
if
compensation--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
still
think
the
state's
rights
with
respect
to
jurisdiction
over
what
is...
once
it's
no
longer
indian
country,
regular
state
land,
would
prevent
congress
from--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it's
state--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--i
think
not.
when
i
said,
state
land,
i
didn't
mean
state-owned
land,
but
land
over
which
the
state
exercises
jurisdiction.
it
had
not
been
reserved
from
state
jurisdiction,
not
public
lands.
it's
private
land,
like
land
anyone
else
would
own,
and
i
think
that
the
federal
government
doesn't
have--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--only
the
metlakatla
reservation.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
yes,
and
that
is--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
and
that
is
not
at
all
inconsistent
with
the
history
of
alaska
up
to
that
point.
most
of
the
cases
that
have
addressed
the
question
have
said
that
there
isn't
indian
country
in
alaska
in
the
first
place.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
is
the
phrase,
and
we
agree
with
the
department
of
interior,
which
has
concluded
that
that
is
the
term
of
art.
it's
a
term
of
art
as
the
revisers
to
18
u.s.c.
1151(b)
said
meant
to
codify
this
court's
decisions
in
sandoval
and
mcgowan.
that's
what
we
think
it
means.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
oh,
it--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
not...
i
think
the
current
view
of
the
united
states
is
in
the
1993
opinion,
which
has
not
been
withdrawn.
it
is
as
final
as
any
of
these
opinions
get.
it
is
not
final
in
the
sense
it
can
always
be
revoked,
but
it
hasn't
been
withdrawn
in
any
way.
it's
been
under
review
for
almost
5
years
now,
but
hasn't
been
withdrawn.
it
represents
the
last
statement
of--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--it
was
signed
by
the
acting
secretary.
it
hasn't
been
published.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it
hasn't
been
published,
but
it
is
the
final
statement
of
the
agency
charged
with
the
responsibility
for
implementing
ancsa,
charged
with
responsibility
for
indian
affairs
in
general,
and
charged
with
responsibility
for--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
it's--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
i
think
it's
entitled
to
significant
weight
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
it
hasn't
been
included
in
the
published
volumes
of
solicitor
opinions,
but
it's
been
signed
by
the
acting...
was
signed
by
the
acting
secretary.
it
represents,
as
far
as
we
know...
it
hasn't
been
withdrawn...
the
views
of
the
agency
charged
with
responsibility
in
this
area.
it's
also
consistent
with
prior
department
of
the
interior
interpretations
both,
for
example,
when
venetie
brought
the
lands
back
and
said,
take
it
in
trust,
interior
said
no,
we
can't.
later,
it
had
an
oil
and
gas
lease
it
wanted
to
have
approved,
and
interior
said,
basically,
we're
not
in
the
business
of
approving
things
now.
you're
on
your
own.
that
was
the
departure
from
prior
indian
policy
that
ancsa
represented.
in
the
lower
48,
the
history
had
been,
in
settling
native
land
claims
in
conflict
with
white
settlers,
setting
the
natives
apart
on
reservations,
which
also
had
the
effect
of
setting
them
apart
from
the
state
government.
alaska
provided
an
opportunity
for
a
fresh
start,
and
congress
seized
it
in
ancsa.
it
said,
we
are
not
going
to
set
this
land
aside
for
your
use
under
our
superintendence.
it's...
to
settle
these
claims,
these
serious
claims,
this
is
your
land,
and
you
can
do
with
it
as
you
see
fit.
the
ancsa
set
the
natives
free
to
manage
their
own
property
without
the
federal
government
looking
over
their
shoulder,
subject,
like
all
property
owners
in
alaska
are,
to
state
law,
but
not
subject
to
any
federal
superintendence,
and
that's
what
makes
the
settlement
lands
incapable
of
constituting
indian
country,
because
indian
country--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--well,
obviously
it
would
be
speculation,
but
we
do
have
a
thorough
exposition
of
the
department
of
the
interior's
views,
which
hasn't
been
withdrawn,
and
i
do
note
that
in
the
three
other
cases
so
far
this
term
where
the
solicitor
general
has
appeared,
it
has
been
on
the
side
of
the
indians.
the
fact
that
he
hasn't
appeared
in
this
case
suggests
to
me
that
he
didn't
think
that
that
position
could
be
taken.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
thank
you,
your
honor.
respondents'
position
confuses
the
question
of
tribal
status
and
the
question
of
indian
country.
they
are
two
separate
questions.
the
department
of
interior
made
that
clear
in
1993
when
it
published
for
the
first
time
the
list
of
federally
recognized
tribes
in
alaska.
it
said
inclusion
on
the
list
does
not
resolve
the
scope
of
powers
of
any
particular
tribe
over
land
and
nonmembers,
and
it
footnoted
the
solicitor
opinion
that
we
have
referenced
in
our
briefs.
nothing
about
the
state's
position
calls
into
question
venetie's
status
as
a
tribe.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
it's
not
technically
been
published
in
the
collected
volumes,
but
it's
not
a
secret.
it's
been
made
public.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
not
smuggled,
but
certainly
made
public.
the
respondent
has
said
that
nothing
changed
when
they
transferred
the
lands
to
the
reservation.
look
at
what
changed.
when
it
was
a
reservation,
the
federal
government
had
control
over
the
land.
it
owned
it.
afterward,
when
the
corporations
had
unilaterally
reconveyed
it
to
the
tribe,
the
federal
government
had
no
ownership
and
no
control,
a
significant
change.
second,
when
the
reservation
was
set
up,
it
was
set
up
by
the
federal
government,
set
apart
for
the
use
of
the
indians
under
federal
superintendence.
this
action
of
reconveying
to
the
tribe
was
not
an
action
of
the
federal
government
at
all,
nor
was
it
approved
by
the
federal
government.
finally,
when
it
was
a
reservation--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--oh,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
reason
to
anticipate
that
the
ancsa
corporations
would
reconvey
the
land
and
dissolve,
not
at
all.
congress
viewed
the
corporations
as
central
to
their
structure,
and
the
notion
that
they
would
dissolve
and
reconvey
the
land
was
not
anticipated.
it
was
anticipated
that
they
would,
because
the
land
was
freely
alienable,
sell
it,
develop
it,
swap
it,
as
ancsa
corporations
have
done.
finally
there
was,
when
it
was
a
reservation,
pervasive
federal
superintendence.
now,
under
the
new
system,
where
the
land
had
been
transferred
back,
there
is
no
federal
superintendence
in
the
sense
there
is
in
a
reservation,
the
viewing
the
community
as
a
dependent
community
that
needs
federal
supervision
and
superintendence.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
absolutely,
and
nothing
in
the
state's
position
is
inconsistent
with
that.
the
issue
is
simply
jurisdiction
over
the
land
and
nonmembers.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
if
you
look
at
it
in
two
ways,
either...
the
most
significant
one
is
control
over
the
decisions.
if
the
tribe
wants
to
sell
the
land
tomorrow,
develop
it
in
a
particular
way,
the
federal
government
has
no
say
about
that,
as
it
did
when
it
was
a
reservation.
in
fact,
when
the
tribe
in
1980
submitted
an
oil
and
gas
lease
for
department
if
interior
approval,
the
department
of
interior
said,
we're
not
in
that
business
any
more.
it's
your
land
to
manage
according
to
your
own
lights.
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
well,
again,
we
think
it
is
a
part
of
the
term
of
art.
it
means,
dependent
indian
community
means,
a
community
like
the
community
in
sandoval,
like
the
community
in
mcgowan,
and
we
don't
think
it
can
be
parsed
any
more
finely
than
that.
it's
also--
mr.
john
g.
roberts,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
because
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
ancsa,
which
gave
to
them
jurisdiction
and
control
over
the
land.
the
state
could,
because
it
is
land
subject
to
state
jurisdiction,
like
everyone
else's
land.
if
it
were
indian
country,
the
state
couldn't,
and
then
either
tribal
or
federal
regulations
of
hunting
and
fishing
would
control.
now,
with
respect
to
the
activities,
that
superintendence
is
going
to
be
viewed
more
broadly,
keep
in
mind
that
this
case
arose
because
the
state
was
building
a
school
in
venetie.
i
think
my
friend
mentioned
that
that
was
a
federal
and
tribal
function.
the
state
provides
the
education.
the
state
has
provided
health
care
services.
the
state
has
provided
electricity
and
water,
public
utilities.
i
don't
think
the
indian
country
determination
hinges
on
who
provides
more
services.
it
hinges
on
the
intent
of
congress,
and
congress'
intent
in
ancsa
was
to
convey
this
land
free
and
clear,
not
to
retain
control,
not
to
continue
to
exercise
superintendence
in
the
terms
it's
been
used
in
this
court's
indian
country
cases.
thank
you.
