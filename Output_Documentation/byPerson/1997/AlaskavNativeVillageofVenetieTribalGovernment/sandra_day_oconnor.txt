mr.
roberts,
why
do
you
suppose
congress
didn't
just
mention
somewhere
in
this
settlement
act
section
1151's
dependent
indian
community
notion?
i
mean,
it
would
have
been
so
easy--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
include
a
little
phrase
there
somewhere
about
that.
why
do
you
think
that
didn't
happen?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
were
some
reservations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
have
some...
i
have
another
just
kind
of
basic
question
here
that
you
can
help
me
with.
what
is
sought
here
by
the
venetie
village
is
the
ability
to
levy
a
certain
kind
of
tax,
in
this
instance
on
construction
of
a
school
building.
now,
can
the
village
be
incorporated,
if
you
will,
as
a
municipality
under
alaska
law
so
that
the
village
would
have
all
the
powers
of
any
incorporated
municipality
in
alaska?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
it
done
so,
to
your
knowledge?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
could.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
if
it
did
that,
could
it
impose
taxes
like
any
other
municipality
in
alaska?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
does
it
apply?
would
it
prevent
this
village
from
becoming--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--a
municipality?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
it
would
have
taxing
powers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
other
municipalities.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
gaming.
you
mean
game
and
fish
laws.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now
we
talk
about
gaming
as
referring
to
gambling.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
say
they
have
plenary
power
over
indian
country.
suppose
this
court
were
to
say
it
isn't
indian
country,
what
power
does
congress
have
then?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--did
the
federal
government
give
this
back?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
the--
--no.
the
corporation
did.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
where
the
landowner
is
the
tribe,
or
the
village,
not
the
state,
then
what
power
would
congress
have
in
the
future
to
treat
it
differently?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
no,
it
isn't
state
land
any
more.
my--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--my
question
relates
to
land
which
is
now
owned,
surface
and
subsurface,
by
the
village
of
venetie.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
congress
decide
subsequently,
by
congressional
enactment,
we
want
to
treat
this
as
a
reservation
or
as
indian
country?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
they
had
a
different
decision
originally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i'm
not
sure
the
answer
is
self-evident
to
that.
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that
was
an
easy
thing
to
answer.
under
your
approach,
is
there
any
indian
country
in
alaska
at
all,
following
the
enactment
of
this
ancsa
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
is
the
one
reservation,
but
that's
a
reservation.
it
isn't
indian
country.
it's
a
reservation
under
a
different
subsection.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
asking
you
whether,
under
your
theory,
there
is
any
indian
country
left
in
alaska.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it's
never
been
issued,
either.
i
mean,
it
just
was
put
in
limbo.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no,
it
hasn't.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
give
any
weight
to
that,
when
the
department
of
interior
and
the
bia
has
never
let
it
be
published,
and
it's
just
sitting
there.
i
mean,
it
makes
interesting
reading.
you
can
understand
it's
logic,
but
i
don't
know
that
we're
entitled
to--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--give
any
weight
to
it
at
all.
it's
like
marbury
v.
madison.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
ms.
kendall,
i
thought
venetie
had
a
reservation
actually,
originally.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
a
reservation.
it
wasn't
what
we
would
call
indian
country.
it
fell
under
a
different
subsection.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
thought
that
the
statute
that
was
passed
did
abolish
the
reservation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
say
that
the
federal
government
recognizes
venetie
as
a
tribe
and...
and
it
offers
some
accompanying
benefits
to
the
tribe.
now,
do
those
facts
alone
mean
that
the
land
is
indian
country,
the
land
we're
talking
about
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
else
is
it
that
you
say
is
necessary
to
create
indian
country
here,
other
than
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
recognizes
the
tribe
and
offers
these--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--aids
and
benefits?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
corporation,
which
is
the
one
that
conveyed
the
land
back
to
the...
to
venetie
village,
what
if
the
corporation
had
sold
some
land
to
some
non-indians
before
it
did
that.
what
about
that
land?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
would
that
be?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
is
the
touchstone
congressional
intent?
is
that
what
we
look
at?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
isn't
that
the
touchstone
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
whether
there's
indian
country?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
here,
congress
provided
that
the
land
title
would
go
to
these
state-chartered
corporations,
not
to
venetie.
that
happened
later.
when
the
corporation
then
conveyed
land
to
venetie
and
didn't
pay
the
fees
and
was
dissolved.
now,
isn't
that
the
way
it
happened?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
gee,
i
thought
it...
i
thought
what
was
done
was
that
pursuant
to
the
congressional
act
the
lands
were
conveyed
to
these
state-chartered
corporations,
not
only
in
the
venetie
area
but
other
areas
in
alaska.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
title
conveyed
to
the
corporations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i'm
having
trouble
seeing
this.
i
can't--
--we're
having--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that's
what
i'm
looking
at.
at
the
top
of
the
page?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
haven't...
hasn't
this
court
found
in
some
circumstances
that
there
is
a
federally
recognized
tribe
that
no
longer
has
a
reservation
or
is
indian
country?
you
can
have
a
federally
recognized
tribe
without
either
of
those
things,
and
the
members
of
the
tribe
can
continue
to
receive
benefits,
isn't
that
true?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
isn't...
i
don't
think
that
answers
the
question.
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
is
it
possible
that
venetie
village
could
seek
status
as
a
municipality
under
alaska
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
if
it
did,
would
it
have
certain
taxing
powers
like
every
other
municipality
in
alaska?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
by
becoming
a
municipality
under
state
law
would
it
give
up
control,
or
wouldn't
it
continue
to
exercise
control?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
was
anticipated
by
it.
you
can
certainly
say
that.
