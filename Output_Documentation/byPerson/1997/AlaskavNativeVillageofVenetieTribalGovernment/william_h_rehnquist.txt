h.

how
do
they
get
that
out
of
v-e-n-e-t-i-e?
may
i

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
could
congress...
supposing...
take
the
case
of
ohio,
which
was
the
case
argued
before,
after

is
admitted
to
the
union,
can

take
back
a
part
of

is
federally

chief

william
h.

very
well,
mr.

ms.
kendall,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
again
is
that,
ms--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--thank
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
certainly
not
the
ordinary
meaning
of
superintendence.
you
know,
you
say...
you're
equating
it
kind
of
with
protections,
the...
but
superintendence
means
some
sort
of
a...
some
sort
of
supervision,
which,
of
course,
doesn't
perhaps
solve
the
problem
very
well.
it
means
something
more
than
just
protecting,
it
seems
to
me.
it's
just
a
kind
of
a
dependent
situation
on
the
part
of
the
people
who
are
being
superintended.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
kendall,

don't
ask
questions
of
the
court.
chief

thank
you,
ms.
kendall.
mr.
roberts,
you
have
5
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
roberts.
the
case
is
submitted.
