justice
stephen
g.
breyer
if
i
could
just
ask
you
right
there,
it's
your
view,
i
take
it,
that
if
you
have
an
area
of
land
that
is
an
absolutely
typical
reservation,
absolutely
typical
in
every
way,
but
somebody
used
the
word
colony
instead
of
the
word
reservation,
then
it
would
fall
within
(b)
and
not
(a).
it
would
fall
within--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--yes,
all
right,
so
that's
precise.
and
then
you
look
at
618(a),
which
revokes
the
reservation.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
you
say,
although
they
didn't
use
the
word,
dependent
community,
they
must
have
intended
to
revoke
that,
too.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
for
that
and
other
reasons.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
but
now,
whatever
those
other
reasons
are,
that
and
other
reasons,
however
strong
they
get
you
to
your
conclusion
in
(a),
why
don't
they
force
the
opposite
conclusion
because
of
(b),
where
a
reservation
goes
back,
revokes
all
the
privileges
it
might
have
gotten
under
this
act,
gives
the
land
back
to
the
tribe,
and
behaves
in
respect
to
the
tribe
exactly
as
it
behaved
before
the
act,
with
land
in
trust?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
yes,
they
reconvey.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what
they
do
is
they
say,
okay,
what
we're
going
to
do
is,
we're
going
to
give
up
everything
we
have
under
this
act,
we're
going
to
take
the
land
just
as
it
was,
call
it
a
reservation,
even,
behave
exactly
the
same
way
in
respect
to
it,
take
it
in,
funnel
it
back,
and
now
what
we
have
after
these
two
events
is
just
what
we
had
before.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
i
agree,
but
my
question
really
is,
if
you're
reading
(a)
non...
(a)
and
other
things
nonliterally
because,
indeed,
the
purpose
must
be
the
same,
since
reservation,
colony,
who
cares,
why
wouldn't
you
read
(b)
the
same
way?
you
see...
why
wouldn't
you
also
read
somewhat
nonliterally
the
giving
back--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--and
therefore,
just
as
when
you
take
it
away,
of
course--
--well,
the
federal--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
well,
in
respect
to
that,
i'm
thinking
just
possibly
that
whatever
reason
they
had
for
revoking
reservation
status
might
equally
well
have
applied
to
whether...
indian...
dependent
indian
community,
just
as
justice
stevens
said.
but
now
i
want
to
explore
the
possibility
that
whatever
reason
they
had
for
giving
back
the
land
to
the
tribe
is
sufficient
to
give
back
the
dependent
status,
and
in
respect
to
that...
that's
under
(b).
you
see
where...
are
you
following?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
all
right.
in
respect
to
that,
i
want
to
know
what
particular
differences
there
are
between...
in
respect
to
superintendency,
dependence,
or
all
those
things
relevant
to
making
a
bit
of
land
a
reservation
or
a
dependent
community.
i
want
to
know
how
that
changed
between
the
time
before
(a)
went
into
effect,
before
ancsa
went
into
effect,
and
the
time
after
the
corporation
took
the
title
and
gave
it
back
to
the
tribe,
i.e.,
the
status
quo.
is
there
zero
change,
or
is
there
some
change?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
what?
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
but
as
far
as
superintendency,
or--
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
--practically,
as
well
as
theoretical.
practically.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
there
is
no
change
whatsoever.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
and
in
terms
of
whether
they
run
a
school,
or
send
letters,
or...
any
practical
thing.
justice
stephen
g.
breyer
superintendence
being...
what
do
you
pin
that
last
statement
on,
there's
now
no
superintendence,
before
there
was?
