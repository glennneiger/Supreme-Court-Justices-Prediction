unknown
speaker
it
was
removed,
in
effect,
by
the
state.
unknown
speaker
right.
now,
if
you're
right
that
the
official
capacity
claims
and
the
claims
against
the
state
involve
defendants
who
aren't
persons
under
section
1983,
why
didn't
the
state
just
waive
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
i
mean,
you're
perfectly
safe.
claims
weren't
going
to
go
forward
under
1983.
did
the
state
consider
waiving
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
if
you're
right,
i
just
don't
see
why
the
state
didn't
do
it.
i
don't...
it
doesn't
make
sense
to
me.
unknown
speaker
well,
would
you
answer
my
question?
unknown
speaker
did
the
state
waive
its
immunity?
unknown
speaker
but
your
position
is
those
claims
against...
the
official
capacity
claims
and
the
claims
against
the
state
cannot
proceed
under
1983
because
the
state
isn't
a
person.
unknown
speaker
okay.
so
why
not
waive
it?
why
not
end
this
thing?
i
just...
it's
the
strangest
posture.
unknown
speaker
and
as
to
that
you
wanted
it
tried
in
federal
court,
not
state
court.
unknown
speaker
so
why
not
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity?
unknown
speaker
well,
maybe
it
should
be.
if
we
could
start
all
over,
it
would
seem
to
me
to
make
some
sense
that
if
the
state
removes,
that
is
a
waiver
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
it
seems
rather
odd
that
you
want
to
go
to
a
court
and
then
say
i
don't
want
to
be
in
the
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
have
to
consent,
as
you
indicate.
you
have
to
consent
to
the
removal.
you
had
the
option
to
keep
it
in
state
court,
but
you
consented
to
be
removed
to
a
federal
court.
he
removed
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
moriarty,
i
remember
asking
the
counsel
in
the
chicago
case
that
we
heard,
one
thinks
of
federal
courts
as
being
a
place
where
you
can
get
away
from
local
prejudice
and
that
sort
of
thing,
but
one
would
think
that
the
state
of
wisconsin
would
be
perfectly
happy
to
be
in
the
state
court.
i
gather
that
isn't
always
the
case.
unknown
speaker
what
difference
does
it
make,
so
long
as
you're
going
to
stand
on
the
eleventh
amendment?
all
this
knowledge
that
the
federal
courts
have
about
federal
law
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned
is
irrelevant,
and
as
to
that,
the
last
piece
of
this...
i
mean,
you
say
we
have
a
right
to
remand
because
the
eleventh
amendment
is
in
the
nature
of
a
defense.
it's
not
like
the
existence
of
federal
question,
jurisdiction
or
diversity.
the
end
of
the
road
as
far
as
the
state
is
concerned,
as
distinguished
from
the
individuals,
you...
do
you
concede
that
the
federal
court
entertaining
your
eleventh
amendment
plea
should
remand
rather
than
dismiss?
unknown
speaker
but
then
i
don't
understand,
because
what
you're
saying
by
your
eleventh
amendment
plea,
the
eleventh
amendment
not
applying
in
the
state
court
whatever
state
immunity
applies,
that
you
cannot
be
sued
any
place,
that
you
are
just
totally
immune,
because
you
do
this,
you
go
over
to
the
federal
court
and
say,
federal
court,
you
can't
touch
it
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
dismiss
the
case,
and
then
no
one
can
touch
it.
unknown
speaker
but
then
you
do
this
over
and
over
again.
it's
without
prejudice.
yes.
then
you
begin
again
in
the
state
court,
and
then
you
remove
it,
and
you
could
do
that
over
and
over
again.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
a
different
issue.
you
don't
want...
you're
saying,
we're
the
state,
you
can't
touch
us,
so
we
don't
get
to
the
question
of
whether
you're
a
person
under
1983,
whether
you're
barred.
that's...
i
could
understand
your
argument
better
if
you
said,
what
we
were
really
trying
to
do
was
to
get
those
officers,
with
their
individual
capacity
complaints,
over
into
the
federal
court.
of
course
we're
not
going
to
say
we
can
manipulate
the
process
by
immunizing
the
state
from
having
any
court--
unknown
speaker
--so
what...
i'm
not
certain.
please
correct
me
if
i--
unknown
speaker
--don't
understand
the
posture
of
this,
but
i
thought
that
these...
that
the
plaintiff
has
sued
the
state,
i.e.
the
official
capacity
ones,
and
also
a
number
of
individuals,
and
then
the
whole
case
is
removed
to
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
and
everybody
wins,
the
defendants
won.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
the
seventh
circuit
sent
the
whole
case
back
to
the
state
court,
and
that
was
the
problem.
why
should
it
send
back
the
part
against
the
individuals?
isn't
that
what
was
bothering
everybody?
i
mean,
the
part
about
the
state,
i
would
think
of
course
they
should
send
back
that
claim.
i
mean,
that
claim,
you've
asserted
the
eleventh
amendment,
has
no
business
in
federal
court,
it's
pendant
to
the
others,
or
it's
one
claim
out
of
many,
and
you
go
back
to
state
court
and
try
it
out
in
the
state
court.
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
i'm
trying
to
find
out
what
the
issue
is
here.
i
mean,
is
anyone
saying...
i
thought
there
is
a
pretty
clear
mistake.
the
clear
mistake
was
in
sending
all
these
other
claims,
the
ones
not
involving
the
state,
back
to
the
state
court.
am
i
right
about
that?
unknown
speaker
good.
all
right.
then
explain
what
i'm
missing.
unknown
speaker
maybe
there's
no
way
of
straightening
me
out.
i'm
trying
to
figure
out
what
happened
in
the
individual
case.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
there
are
actions
against
the
state
and
there
are
actions
against
people
that
aren't
the
state,
and
i
thought
the
seventh
circuit
sent
the
whole
kit
and
caboodle
back
to
state
court.
unknown
speaker
now,
that's
wrong,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
is
there
anything
wrong
about
their
sending
back
the
action
against
the
state
to
state
court?
unknown
speaker
why?
unknown
speaker
ah.
unknown
speaker
right,
so
they
should
have
used
a
different
reason.
the
normal
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
say,
well,
we
decide
all
the
other
claims,
but
the
one
about
the
state
itself
on
official
capacity,
that's
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
so
we
send
that
one
back
like
a
pendant
claim.
that's
your
view
of
how
it
should
have
worked.
unknown
speaker
so
you're
going
to
end
up--
unknown
speaker
--yes,
and
so
you're
going
to
end
up
in
the
state
court
anyway.
unknown
speaker
then
you're
changing
the
answer
to
the
question.
originally
you
said,
no,
no,
we're
saying
federal
court.
the
only
thing
you
can
do
with
the
state
is
dismiss
it,
not
remand,
and
now
i
think
in
response
to
justice
breyer's
question,
you're
kind
of
saying,
well,
maybe
not.
maybe
there's
discretion
to
remand.
but
you
have
no
discretion
unless
you
have
authority
in
the
first
place.
unknown
speaker
well,
may
i
interrupt
you
on
that
point?
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
that
there
are
two
different
jurisdictional
issues
involved
here.
1441
talks,
i
think
quite
plainly,
about
constitutional
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
that's
what
you're
assuming
and
i
agree
with
you.
but
1447(c)
talks
simply
about
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
not
original
jurisdiction
but
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
and
it
may
well
be
that,
given
the
way
this
court
has
construed
the
eleventh
amendment,
that
there
was
federal
question
jurisdiction
for
1441
purposes
so
that
the
case
was
properly
removed,
but
once
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
was
raised,
the
court
no
longer
had
subject
matter
jurisdiction
within
the
meaning
of
1447(c),
and
therefore
was
obligated
to
remand
for
that
purpose.
would
that
be
a
possibility?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
the...
but
isn't
that
a
matter
of
semantics?
i
mean,
it's
an
action
insofar
as
it's
against
the
state,
and
insofar
as
it's
against
state
officers
in
official
capacity.
that's
the
case
against
them,
and
so
far
as
the
case
against
them
is
concerned,
isn't
subject
matter
jurisdiction
lost
once
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
is
raised?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
just
agreed...
i
thought
you
just
agreed
with
justice
breyer
that
they
could
be
parceled
out
in
that
fashion,
because
we
can
split
the
claims
against
the
individuals,
the
individual
responsibility
claims
from
the
government
claims,
so
you're
parceling
them
out.
unknown
speaker
why
can
it
be
parceled
when
the
court
is
acting
on
the
discretionary
power
but
not
be
parceled
when
the
court
is
considering
whether
it
has
a
mandate?
unknown
speaker
but
surely
it's
not
your
position,
mr.
moriarty,
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
bar
to
the
claims
against
the
individual
defendants.
unknown
speaker
and
those,
then,
would
be
litigated
in
the
district
court
under
a
correct
ruling?
unknown
speaker
but
now,
let's
put
the...
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
that
you
pleaded
in
your
view
requires
dismissal
of
the
action
as
against
the
state
and
the
official
capacity
defendant.
unknown
speaker
but
it
does
not
require
dismissal
as
to
the
individual
defendants.
unknown
speaker
so
the
district
court
could
properly
adjudicate
those
claims.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
this:
under
wisconsin
law,
can
the
attorney
general,
by
his
or
her
own
determination,
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
in
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
so
only
the
legislature
can
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
by
special
statute?
unknown
speaker
who
do
you--
--may
i
ask
why
1441(c)
is
relevant
at
all?
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
1441(c)
didn't
envision
the
reason
for
non-federal
jurisdiction,
which
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
ah,
okay.
no,
i
thought
there
was
some
discussion
about
remanding
the
portions
of
the
cause
of
action
which
do
not
consist
of
federal
claims
to
the
state
court.
unknown
speaker
well,
isn't
(c)
relevant
to
the
extent
that
it
establishes
the
fact
that
the
district
judge
could
have
sent
back...
could
have
remanded
the
claims
against
the
state,
the
official
capacity
claims?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
we
have
a
case,
the
coville
case
which
says
that
the
statute
does
not
preclude
a
remand
that
isn't
covered
by
the
precise...
that
these...
the
statute
covers
must
remands.
it
doesn't
necessarily
cover
may
remands.
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
just
clarify
one
thing
in
your
position?
do
you
agree
the
district
court
could
have
remanded
and
should
have
remanded
the
claims
against
the
state
that
are
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
in
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
who
do
you
represent?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
you
represent
them,
too.
unknown
speaker
fine.
then
i
took
from
your
cert
position
your
basic
point...
maybe
you're
being
too
subtle
about
it
here,
but
i
took
your
basic
point
to
be
from
the
cert
petition
that
at
least
the
seventh
amendment
was
mistaken
in
ordering
the
personal
claims
sent
back,
that
they
shouldn't...
even
if
they're
right
about
having
the
eleventh
amendment
claims
sent
back,
that's
just
one
claim,
or
one
set
of
claims--
unknown
speaker
--in
a
multiclaim
suit,
and
they
can't
say
you
have
to
send
them
all
back.
wasn't
that
your
basic
claim
before
you
even
get
into
this?
unknown
speaker
okay.
now,
once
you'd
say
we
win
on
that
we
have
a
separate
argument,
and
the
separate
argument
is,
they
shouldn't
have
even
sent
back
the
state
claim,
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
if
they'd
looked
at
it
for
3
minutes
they
would
have
seen
that
the
eleventh
amendment
part
is
irrelevant,
because
you
can't
assert
the
eleventh
amendment
in
defense
to
a
claim
that
doesn't
exist,
and
the
claim
doesn't
exist
because
of
your
interpretation
of
1983.
now,
is
that
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
it's
unnecessary.
there's
an
alternative
ground.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
unknown
speaker
but
your
first
argument
is
the
main
argument,
and
your
second...
i
mean,
and
don't
tell
me
i'm
right
if
i'm
not.
i
want
to
be
certain
i'm
understanding
this.
is
that...
have
i
now
stated
what
your
argument
is,
basically?
unknown
speaker
the
first
part
is,
they
shouldn't
have
sent
the
whole
thing
back.
unknown
speaker
the
second
part
is,
if
we
win
on
that
one,
they
shouldn't
have
even
sent
the
state
part
back.
unknown
speaker
okay.
well,
but
now,
if
you
have
two
grounds,
one
is
the
eleventh
amendment
and
another
is
a
ground
of
statutory
construction,
one
is,
we've
said,
quasi-jurisdictional
and
the
other
is
simply
an
argument
on
the
law.
i
would
think
that
the
eleventh
amendment
argument
would
prevail
over
the
statutory
construction
argument.
unknown
speaker
was
this
post-steel
co.,
not--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
well,
i
thought
steel
co.
was
our
last
word.
unknown
speaker
and
i
thought
we
said
you
address,
unsurprisingly,
jurisdictional
issues
first.
unknown
speaker
and
in
this
one,
if
you
take
the
words
of
the
constitution
it
says
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
shall
not
extend
to
any
suit,
so
that
sounds...
there
is
no
power
over
such
a
suit.
how
you
would
get
to
the
1983
person
question
if
there
is
no
power
to
do
anything
is
a
bit
of
a
mystery.
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
the
same
question.
unknown
speaker
you
can
answer...
look
at
either
one
of
us.
i
don't
care.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
yes,
because
you
could
waive
it.
unknown
speaker
we
don't
know
whether
it's
that
kind
of
bar
until
the
state
doesn't
waive
it,
correct?
unknown
speaker
by
failing
to
raise
the
eleventh
amendment
as
a
defense,
the...
it
may
not
be
the
same
thing
as
a
waiver,
where
you
expressly
renounce
reliance
on
it,
but
by,
if
you
fail
to
raise
the
defense
at
any
time
during
the
proceedings,
the
proceedings
stand.
unknown
speaker
it's
not
like
a
case
where
there
simply
was
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
here
you
did
raise
it.
unknown
speaker
one
part
of
this
before
you
finish
that
i
don't
quite
understand.
since
you're
so
clear
on
the
1983,
not
a
person
argument,
why
didn't
you,
over
in
the
wisconsin
state
court,
say,
wisconsin
state
court,
get
the
state
out
of
it,
we're
not
a
1983
person?
then
you'd
have
a
clean
suit
that
the
individuals...
that
the
defendants
being
sued
in
their
individual
capacity
could
remove.
unknown
speaker
so
you
say...
are
you
saying
that
the
individuals
would
have
been
untimely
if
they
didn't
petition
to
remove
until
after
the
state
was
dismissed?
unknown
speaker
you
made
the
right
litigation
decision,
we'll
assume.
you
removed...
now
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
is
raised,
why...
tell
me...
explain
at
that
point
why
the
court
is
not
bound
to
remand.
unknown
speaker
but
it
no
longer
has...
if
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
is
correct,
it
no
longer
would
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
oh,
look,
over
the
state
and
the
official
capacity
defendants.
it
would
no
longer
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
them,
would
it?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
these--
--but
the
point
is...
the
point
is,
removal
was
allowable,
initially.
unknown
speaker
and
once
the
state
in
federal
court
says,
wait
a
minute,
eleventh
amendment
as
to
state
claims,
then
those
claims
could
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
and
you
can
go
deal
with
it
back
in
state
court,
leave
the
individual
capacity
claims
in
the
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
adequate?
i
mean,
doesn't
that
take
care
of
everything?
unknown
speaker
you
can
go
back
to
state
court
and
make
your
pitch
on
person.
unknown
speaker
and
why
shouldn't
that
be
done?
unknown
speaker
in
other
words,
why
shouldn't
it
be
done?
unknown
speaker
stand
back
from
it--
--yes.
yes.
--and
our
colloquy
before.
you
are
saying,
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment,
no
court
can
deal
with
a
1983
person.
we
just
get
out.
we
just
get
out
at
the
threshold.
we
take
it
out
of
the
state
court,
put
it
into
the
federal
court,
and
then
say,
federal
court,
you
dismiss,
and
then
we're
not
subject
to
having
that
question
decided
by
any
court,
ever,
and
that's
a
very
hard
argument
to
make.
unknown
speaker
but
you're
asking
for
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
out,
at
least
after
his
recent
decision
that
would
come
first,
before
you
deal
with
the
merits.
unknown
speaker
would
you
say
it's
not
jurisdiction,
since
it
could
be
waived?
you
say
it's
not
jurisdictional.
is
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
mm-hmm.
but
it's
not
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
then.
unknown
speaker
over
the
person.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
you're
back...
i
mean,
your
argument
now
is
back
to
saying,
you
cannot
split
them
up.
you're
back
to
saying
you
cannot
deal
with
the
official
action
differently
from
the
way
you
deal
with
the
individual
action.
that's
the
premise
of
your
answer
that
you
just
gave,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
then
i
don't
understand.
unknown
speaker
right,
and
this
is
unlike
city
of
chicago
because
once
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
is
raised,
you
don't
have...
the
federal
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
adjudicate
the
state
and
the
official
capacity
claims,
so
chicago
doesn't
cover
this.
unknown
speaker
and
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
you,
that
with
respect
to
the
state
and
the
official
capacity
claims,
it
was
error
to
remand.
why
was
it
error
to
remand?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
should
they
not
have
done
the
same
thing
on
the
basis
of
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction,
not
article
iii
jurisdiction,
maybe,
but
at
least
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
moriarty.
mr.
lasker,
we'll
hear
from
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
couldn't
the
federal
court
retain
the
action
and
decide
the
individual
capacity
claims,
remand
the
claims
against
the
state,
and
there
you
are?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
matter
with
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
does
entirely,
and
the
case
was
removable
in
the
first
instance,
but
once
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
is
asserted,
then
the
federal
court
can
remand
so
much
of
the
case
as
deals
with
the
eleventh
amendment
claims
and
keep
the
rest.
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that
was
where
the
seventh
circuit's
decision
appears
questionable.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
it
fits.
i
mean,
as
long
as...
if
we
don't
know
if
the
state
is
going
to
assert
an
eleventh
amendment
defense,
and
certainly
the
suit
originally
filed
included
section
1983
claims
against
individuals
in
their
individual
capacity,
so
the
whole
thing
could
have
been
filed
in
federal
district
court
as
an
original
proposition.
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
where
i
disagree.
it
certainly
had
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
against
the
individuals
in
their
individual
capacity.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
i
think
mr.
moriarty
pointed
out
that
the
individuals
might
have
been
told
you're
too
late
to
remove,
because
the
case
was
removable
earlier.
unknown
speaker
is
it
your
position
that
the
state
could
have
moved,
or
the
circuit
court
of
dane
county,
they
could
have
moved
in
that
court
to
dismiss
claims
that
would
have
been
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
in
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
certainly
not
on
the
grounds
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
that's
not
binding
on
the
state--
unknown
speaker
--but
that's
saying
that
you
have
to
do
what
litigating
you
can
in
the
state
court.
i
don't
know
if
that's
faithful
to
the
removal
statute.
unknown
speaker
it
couldn't
have
been
so
clear,
because
you
missed
it.
you
never...
you
didn't
resist
the
remand.
nobody
ever
thought
of
it
till
it
got
to
the
seventh
circuit,
right?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand.
i
mean,
i
must
be
maybe
missing
something
obvious.
forget
state
court.
suppose
i,
a
plaintiff,
feel
my
civil
rights
were
infringed,
and
i
want
to
sue
a
lot
of
people,
so
i
march
into
the
door
of
the
federal
district
court
and
i
sue
four
policemen
and
the
municipality,
and
i
throw
in
a
state
official,
and
i
add,
in
his
official
capacity,
so
i
have
seven
suits,
seven
claims
in
this
suit.
unknown
speaker
i
would
have
thought...
is
there
any
law,
any
case,
anything
that
says
that
i
can't
bring
that
lawsuit
in
a
federal
district
court?
i
thought
that's
garden
variety.
i
thought
it
happens
every
day
of
the
week
that
people
bring
suits
like
that
in
the
federal
district
court
and
then,
if
the
state
happens
to
assert
eleventh
amendment
as
to
its
claim,
at
that
point,
maybe
we
dismiss
that
claim,
but
am
i
wrong
about
my
garden
variety,
and
way
this
civil
rights
law
works,
because
you
do
know
a
lot
about
that.
unknown
speaker
forgetting...
yes.
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
now,
is
there
any
precedent
anywhere
where
a
judge
didn't
accept
such
a
case?
unknown
speaker
so
as
far
as
we
know,
no;
this
would
be
historical
to
say
that
they
can't
have
cases
like
that
in
federal
district
court,
and
your
reason
for
saying
that
is?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
lasker,
what
about
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
which
says
that
you
can
add
and
drop
parties
any
time,
so
you
were
wrong
about
naming
a
state
or
a
state
officer.
you
just
drop
that
party.
that--
unknown
speaker
--well,
mr.
lasker,
i
thought
city
of
chicago
was
relevant
in
one
respect
in
this
case.
it
made
clear
that
the
existence
of
some
properly
stated
federal
claims
suffices
to
make
actions,
civil
actions
within
the
original
jurisdiction
of
the
district
courts
for
purposes
of
removal.
some
federal
claims.
i
thought
city
of
chicago
spoke
to
that,
and
so
your
argument
rings
hollow
to
my
ear--
unknown
speaker
--on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
it
did
not
involve
claims
which
would
be
potentially
subject
to
an
eleventh
amendment
immunity
defense.
unknown
speaker
it
did
not.
but
in
principle
it's
the
same
because
unless
and
until
the
eleventh
amendment
is
raised,
it's
okay.
unknown
speaker
but
you
deal
with
it
by
remanding
the
claims
in
which
the
eleventh
amendment
would
cover
it
and
go
on
with
what's
left.
unknown
speaker
that's...
on
reading
that...
that
that's
all.
i...
shall
be
remanded
says,
when
you
fit
this,
then
it
must
be
remanded.
it
doesn't
say
that
nothing
else
can
be
remanded,
and
the
notion
that
somehow
this
case
is...
doesn't
belong
in
federal
court,
even
though
city
of
chicago
does,
is
staggering,
because
here
there's
nothing
but
federal
law,
is
all.
there's
no
claim
made
under
any
law
other
than
federal
law,
as
i
understand
this
complaint.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
there's
no
exclusive
venue.
i
mean,
if
you...
you
can
say
yes,
sometimes
congress
lets
people
sue
in
state
court
if
they
want
to,
like
the
fela.
there's
nothing
like
that
here.
unknown
speaker
you
can
bring
a
1983
action
in
state
court,
can
you
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
defendants
in
1983
actions
can
remove
them
to
federal
court,
as
defendants
in
fela
cases
could
not,
because
there
congress
says,
not
only
can
you
bring
it
in
state
court,
but
it
can't
be
removed
if
you
bring
it
there.
unknown
speaker
and
i
take
it
that
as
part
of
this
clarification
you
are
going
to
stick
with
your
answer
that
you
gave
to
justice
breyer.
he
said,
forget
state
court,
you
go
into
federal
court
with
all
of
these
claims,
one
of
them,
which
is
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment,
six
of
which
are
good
federal
claims.
as
i
understood
your
answer
to
the
question
you
said
the
entire
case
must
be
dismissed,
and
then
justice
ginsburg
said,
well,
what
about
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure,
and
you
said,
well,
what
the
state
court
does
is
to
sort
things
out,
but
that
was
avoiding
the
hypothetical.
the
hypothetical
was,
just
the
federal
court,
so
it
seemed
to
me
that
you
didn't
answer
correctly
when
you
responded
to
justice
ginsburg's
suggestion,
and
i
want
to
know
if
as
part
of
this
overall
clarification
you're
suggesting
that
we
say,
if
there's
one
cause
of
action
over
which
the
federal
court...
forget
the
state
court.
this
is,
initially
you
file
it
in
the
united
states
district
court.
if
there's
one
cause
of
action
over
which
there's
an
eleventh
amendment
jurisdictional
problem,
eleventh
amendment
jurisdictional
bar,
the
entire
case
must
be
dismissed.
unknown
speaker
that
is...
you
have
absolutely
no
authority
for
that
proposition.
unknown
speaker
and
the
federal
rules
of
civil
procedure
are
against
you.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
these
cases
happen
all
the
time...
all
the
time.
it's
just
because
of
the
rather
unusual
step
taken
by
the
seventh
circuit
that
we
have
it
here.
unknown
speaker
i
can
understand
that
part
of
it,
and
that's
what
this
case
is.
this
is
a
removal
case.
but
the
case
that
i
put
to
you,
and
justice
kennedy
just
recalled,
of
an
initial
proceeding
in
federal
court
with
some
defendants,
why
would
it
be
any
different
than
if
you
filed
a
diversity
suit
and
you
had
one
nondiverse
defendant,
and
there
was
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
lack
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction?
you'd
say,
fine,
i
drop
the
nondiverse
defendant.
why
is
this
any
different
as
an
initial
matter?
unknown
speaker
forget
removal.
unknown
speaker
we're
in
federal
court
with
a
complaint
that
includes
the
state
and
individuals.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
a
motion
to
dismiss
the
state
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds.
isn't
that
all
that
would
be
dismissed?
if
in
other
words,
you
have
this
case
originally
in
federal
court.
the
state
gets
out
when
it
moves
to
dismiss
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds.
the
other
defendants
don't.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well
then,
your
argument
should
address
why
it
should
be
different
on
removal
than
it
would
have
been
if
the
case
were
originally
filed
in
federal
court,
and--
unknown
speaker
--perhaps
pointing
to
some
statutory
language.
unknown
speaker
some
statutory
language
that
somehow
overrules
the
extant
statutory
language
that
says
that
any
civil
action
brought
in
a
state
court
of
which
the
district
courts
of
the
united
states
have
original
jurisdiction
may
be
removed,
so
we
need
a
statute
that
somehow
undoes
that,
but
you've
conceded
it
could
have
been
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court.
unknown
speaker
it's
critical
to
your
position,
as
i
understand
it,
that
if
there
is
an
eleventh
amendment
defense
potentially
available
to
one
of
the
defendants,
that
the
court
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
and
that
we
have
not
yet
held.
unknown
speaker
and
that
would
be
true
in
an
original
filing
under
federal...
in
federal
court,
surely,
just
as
true
as
if
the
action
were
removed
from
state
court.
unknown
speaker
you're
changing
your
answer,
then.
i
mean,
i
think
if
you
give
away
that...
the
answer
to
justice
ginsburg's
and
justice
breyer's
question
of
what
would
have
happened
had
this
suit
been
originally
brought
in
district
court,
i
think
your
case
is
gone.
you
have
to
defend
the
position
that
this
action
would
not
have
been
originally
bringable
in
a
federal
court.
unknown
speaker
all
right,
can
i
say...
i'm
trying
to
find
some
authority
for
you.
i
mean,
here
you
got
another
shot
at
this
from
the
seventh
circuit,
so
i
don't
blame
you
at
all
for
defending
this,
but
i'm
trying
to
think
of
the
authority
that
might
support
you.
is
there
any
authority
in
the
following
proposition?
i
now
go
to
the
federal
district
court
and
i
file
my
claim,
which
i
have
my
four
defendants,
lots
of
federal
law,
and
one
of
my
19
claims...
one
of
them...
there
is
no
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over,
for
whatever
set
of
reasons.
forget
the
eleventh
amendment.
is
there
any
authority,
when
that
situation
arises...
i
would
have
thought
all
that
happens
is,
they
dismiss
that
claim
and
proceed
with
the
rest.
but
is
there
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
you
have
to
dismiss
the
whole
thing?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
now,
to
take
them...
is
there
any
authority
for
the
proposition
that
when
you
remove
such
a
case
from
the
state
court
to
the
federal
court
you
have
to
dismiss
the
whole
thing,
i.e.,
you
couldn't
remove
it?
unknown
speaker
then
i
think
you're
on
a
tough
ground.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
i
wouldn't
because
i
mean,
you
say,
well,
this
will
be
quite
simple.
i'm
not
sure
it
would
be
simple.
there
are
a
lot
of
cases,
you
know,
where
you
don't
quite
know
whether
this
is
a
state
official,
not
a
state
official,
official
capacity,
not
official
capacity,
everybody
gets
mixed
up
and
they
have
huge
arguments,
and
the
whole
case
would
have
to
be
sent
back
to
another
court.
that's
worrying
me.
i
suppose
one
of
the
things
that's
wrong
is
that
the
state,
by
quite
a
sensible
rule,
it
seems
to
me,
should
be
deemed
to
have
waived
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity
the
minute
it
consents
to
the
removal,
but
that's
not
our
law,
either.
unknown
speaker
mr.
lasker,
you
have
a
statement
in
your
brief
that
the
state
was
not
immune
from
suit
in
state
court.
isn't
there
a
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
that's
applicable
in
the
state
court?
i
mean--
unknown
speaker
--on
the
top
of
page
9
you
say
that
the
seventh
circuit
held
the
district
court
lacked
original
jurisdiction
because
petitioners
were
immune
from
suit
in
the
federal
court,
and
then
you
add,
although
they
were
not
immune
from
suit
in
the
state
court.
of
course,
they
don't
have
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
but--
unknown
speaker
--most
states
have
their
own
sovereign
immunity
doctrine,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
there
isn't
something
like
a
wisconsin
tort
claims
act
that
would
allow
a
wrongful
discharge
case
to
be
brought
against
the
state?
unknown
speaker
is
your...
are
the
circuit
courts
in
wisconsin
courts
of
general
jurisdiction?
unknown
speaker
where
you
don't
have
limitations
of
subject
matter
the
way
you
do
in
the
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
mr.
lasker,
what
prevents
us
from
holding
that
when
a
state
removes
or
consents
to
removal
of
a
case
into
federal
court
it
waives
its
eleventh
amendment
objection?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
mean,
isn't
it
clear
that
when
you
say,
i
want
to
be
in
federal
court,
you
mean
i
want
to
be
in
federal
court?
unknown
speaker
we
wouldn't
have
any
of
these
troubles
if
that
were
the
rule.
unknown
speaker
if
it
were,
then
maybe
mr.
moriarty
could
not
have
removed
the
case,
because
he
said
that
under
state
law
they
have
no
authority,
the
state
ag
has
no
authority
to
waive
the
eleventh
amendment.
unknown
speaker
it
follows
from
that,
doesn't
it,
that
if
that's
true,
then
it
was
clear
even
before
the
removal,
because
of
the
state
law
situation,
that
there
would
never
have
been
jurisdiction
in
the
federal
court
over
part
of
the
case,
because
the...
because
it's
foreordained
that
it's
not
optional,
as
your
opponent
suggests,
that
they
may
or
may
not
waive
it.
the
law
of
wisconsin
required
him
to
assist...
assert
his
eleventh
amendment
jurisdiction
and,
therefore,
following
the
reasoning
of
the
seventh
circuit,
they
had
to
send
the
whole
case
back.
they
could
not
accept
the
removal
because
there
was
a
jurisdictional
bar.

you
don't
know
which
side
i'm
on
here.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
because
as
a
matter
of
wisconsin
law,
it's
clear
that
the
federal
court
never
had...
could
have
taken
jurisdiction
of
the
claim
against
the
state,
as
a
matter
of
wisconsin
law,
which
they
would
have
to
honor,
that
they
could
not
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
defense.
unknown
speaker
of
course,
the
federal
court
would
have
had
jurisdiction
if
the
state
had
simply
processed
its
removal
and
made
no
objection
on
eleventh
amendment
grounds.
it
doesn't
have
to
waive
in
the
sense
of
affirmatively
renouncing.
it
can
simply
do
nothing
and
the
eleventh
amendment
defense
is
waived.
