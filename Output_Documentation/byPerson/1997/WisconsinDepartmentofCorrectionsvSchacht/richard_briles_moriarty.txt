mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
action
substantial
federal
questions
were
presented
by
the
individual
capacity
claims
respondent
chose
to
make
against
warden
catherine
farrey
and
the
other
wisconsin
employees
who
are
defendants
in
this
action.
he
sued
them
personally
under
a
federal
statute,
section
1983,
alleging
violations
of
the
federal
constitution.
substantial
federal
questions
were
presented.
had
this
action
proceeded
in
district
court
on
an
initial
complaint,
the
district
court
would
unquestionably
have
had
original
jurisdiction
because
substantial
federal
questions
were
presented.
the
potential,
had
this
commenced
in
district
court,
the
potential
that
those
claims
could
have
been
barred
by
a
sovereign
immunity
defense
or
any
of
those
claims
could
have
been
barred
by
a
sovereign
immunity
defense
would
not
have
affected
original
jurisdiction
of
the
court.
this
case
instead
was
removed.
it
arrived
by
removal
rather
than
an
initial
complaint.
the
analysis--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--it
was
removed
by
the
state
and
the
employees
of
the
state
sued
both
personally
and
officially.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
your
honor,
there
are--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--we
return
back
to
the
decision
on
whether
to
remove.
the
claims
as
to
which
sovereign
immunity
applied
were
really
irrelevant
because,
whether
this
case
was
prosecuted
in
federal
court
or
state
court,
they
would
have
been
barred.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
i'm--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--it
did
not
waive
its
immunity.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
that's
correct.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
we
are
now
looking
back,
your
honor,
at...
from
the
perspective
of
the
seventh
circuit
decision
at
the
initial
removal
decision.
at
the
time
of
removal,
the
claims
made
against
the
state
were
clearly
barred
either
under
will...
in
both
state
and
federal
court
either
under
will,
because
it
wasn't
within
the
definition
of
a
person,
or
based
on
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
or
sovereign
immunity
in
state
court.
the
real
crux
of
the
case
was
the
individual
capacity
claims
made
against
the
individual.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
that's--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--because
that's
not
a
price
of
admission
to
the
federal
court,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
by
joining
with
the
officials
sued
personally
in
removing,
which
is
required
by
the
removal
statutes,
the
state
is
not
saying
we
want
to
be
in...
we
don't
want
to
be
in
court.
obviously,
they're
in
court.
the
question
is--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--certainly
it
was
a
litigation
decision
by
all
of
the
defendants
joining
together,
but
the
sovereign...
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
defense.
it
is
not
part
of
the
initial
threshold
jurisdictional
question.
is
there
a
substantial
federal
question?
of
course
there
is.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
it
isn't
always
the
case
in
individual
cases.
for
example,
we
have
strictly
federal
constitutional
claims
here.
a
body
of
federal
constitutional
law
that
has
developed,
particularly
in
the
seventh
circuit,
where
there's
binding
precedent
on
the
district
courts.
there
would
not
be
that
binding
precedent
on
the
state
courts.
if,
as
a
litigator--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--answering
the
second
question
first,
i
do
not
concede
that.
the
federal
court
had
federal
question
jurisdiction.
it
had
it...
it
would
have
had
it
had
an
initial
complaint
been
filed.
it
had
it
on
removal.
it
is
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
remand
claims
that
are
properly
before
it
and
that
were
properly
dismissed
by
the
district
court
through
that...
through
the
full
litigation
that
occurred.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
right.
the...
when
the
eleventh
amendment
applies,
generally
it's
dismissal
without
prejudice,
such
that
if
it--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--we
had
here,
however,
claims
under
section
1983
that
were
barred
in
any
court
regardless.
the
state
court,
the
federal
court
would
have
barred--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--that's
precisely
what
we
were
trying
to
do,
your
honor.
the
claims
as
to
the
state,
the
official
capacity
claims
and
the
claims
against
the
state
agency,
were
irrelevant
to
the
removal
decision.
the
point
was,
we
were
going
to
have
litigation
on
the
individual
capacity
claims.
those
are
the
ones
that
the
district
court
spent
time
on.
the
district
court
spent
a
paragraph
on
the
official
capacity
claims.
so
did
we
in
our
briefs,
essentially.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
yes.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
correct.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
correct.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
it
could
be
tried,
certainly,
in
the
state
court.
however,
your
honor--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--i
don't
believe
you're
right.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
the
issue
that
i
see
is
the
broader
issue
of
what
kind
of
a
system
are
we
going
to
have
that
is
simple
and
effective
for
removal,
that
is
simple
and
effective
for
determining
jurisdictional
questions,
that
is
simple
and
effective
for
determining
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
what
happens
in
this
individual
case
is
actually
irrelevant--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--fine.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
it
did.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
it
was
wrong
in
doing
that.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction,
yes.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
it
may
not
have
been.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
they
turned
on
jurisdiction
and
said,
there
was
not
removal
jurisdiction
at
the
threshold
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
yes.
if,
in
fact,
there
is
authority
to
do
that--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--as
a
matter
of
discretion.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
we
might.
the
result
might
be
the
same,
but
as
a
matter
of
discretion,
leaving
intact
the
vital
differences
between
jurisdictional
analysis,
discretionary
analysis,
eleventh
amendment
immunity
analysis.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
that's
correct,
justice
ginsburg,
and
it
is
precisely
the
point,
and
i
thank
you
for
tightening
that.
on
the
issue
of
jurisdiction,
do
we...
did
the
district
court
have
jurisdiction?
must
the
appellate
court
remand
one
or
more
of
these
claims
as
a
matter
of
jurisdiction?
must
they?
no.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
yes.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
i
don't
believe
it
would
fall
within
the
1447
issue
because
i
do
believe
subject
matter
jurisdiction
in
1447(c)
goes
to
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
action,
not
over
a
particular
claim.
here,
unquestionably
throughout
the
case--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
claims
within
an
action
are
not
parceled
out
in
that
fashion.
i
believe
the--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--when
we
get
to
the
discretionary
issue,
far
from
the
jurisdictional
issue.
in
other
words,
when
we're
looking
at
jurisdiction
to
begin
with--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--based
on
this
court's
decisions
that,
for
example,
in
city
of
chicago
the
court
had
original...
had
federal
question
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
action,
over
all
the
claims
in
the
action
because
of
the
federal
claims.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
certainly
not.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
the...
those
claims...
the
district
court
had
federal
question
jurisdiction
on
removal.
therefore,
it
could
dispose
of
the
eleventh
amendment
barred
claims
on...
it
could
dispose...
the
claims
against
the
state,
either
based
on
the
definition
in
1983
or
based
on
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
correct.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
correct.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
the...
certainly
the
individual
capacity
claims,
yes.
the--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--no.
that's
been...
it's
in
the
statutes
and
it's
also
been
litigated.
the
attorney
general
does
not
have
authority
to
waive
eleventh...
sovereign
immunity.
under
the
wisconsin
constitution
only
the
legislature
has
the
authority
to--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--right,
either
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
or
sovereign
immunity,
correct.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
i'm
sorry
if
i
misspoke.
i
meant
1447(c).
i
think
that's
what
we're
referring
to.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
correct.
1441(c)
i
did
not
see
as
relevant
either
and
did
not
put
in
my
brief.
pages
5
and
6
cite
the
portions
of
1441(a)
and
(b)
and
1447(c),
which
i
believe
to
be
relevant.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
i
believe
that
the
1441(c)
addresses
an
entirely
different
situation,
and
involves
when
there's
a
separable
controversy,
when
there's
not,
that
type
of
thing,
whereas
in
this
case
it's
clear
we
have
one
single
controversy,
the
firing
of
the
respondent.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
that's
the
central
point
i'm
trying
to
make,
that
the...
this
decision
by
the
seventh
circuit
was
wrong
because
it
looked
at
what
must
occur
as
a
matter
of
threshold
jurisdiction,
mixed
together
the
discretionary
issues,
mixed
together
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
jurisdictional
issues,
and--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--i
do
not
believe
they
should
have
remanded
it.
i
think
what
they
should
have
done,
if
they
had
jurisdictional
questions,
which
they
surely
did,
looked
at
the
issue,
looked
immediately
at
the
1983
definition
and
said,
we
don't
have
anything
here
against
the
state,
and
moved
to
the
merits
of
the
appeal.
if
they
wanted
to
look
at
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
then
they
could
have
said,
well,
that's
fine,
but
that
comes
later
in
the
jurisdictional
analysis.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
we
represent
the
wisconsin
agency,
the
officials
in
their
official
capacity,
but
the
primary
motivation
on
removal
was
the
officials
in
their
individual
capacity.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
absolutely.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
right.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
that
is
absolutely
fundamental
ground
floor--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--with
this
variation.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
eleventh
amendment
can
bar
those
claims.
it's
simply
unnecessary.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
exactly.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
and
the
point
is--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--i--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--yes.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
correct.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
that
would
be
the
case
except
for
this
court's
decisions
in
ngirainga
v.
sanchez,
in
which
it
took
up
that
definitional
issue
first,
over
the
strenuous
objections
of
the
dissent,
and
that
wanted
the
immunity
issues
addressed
first
in
ngiraingas.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
it
was
not
post-steel--
[laughter]
last
month.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
indeed.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
correct.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
which--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--okay.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
in
the
idaho
case
the
court
looked
at
the
words,
in
particular
the
word
extends
in
article
iii
and
looked
at
the
word
extends
in
the
eleventh
amendment
and
said,
they
seem
similar,
yes,
it
must
be
the
same
thing.
it's
not.
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
has
never
been
held
to
be
a
bar
to
jurisdiction
over
an
action
at
the
threshold,
and
that's
what
we're
dealing
with
here.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
we
could
waive
it.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
and
also
it
is
a
defense.
it's...
it
can
be
waived.
very
difficult
to
waive
it.
it
can
be
waived,
and
also
it
is
a
defense,
and
in
the
removal
setting
particularly,
as
just
noted
in
rivet,
a
defense,
removal
jurisdiction
is
not
determined
based
on
a
defense.
it's
based
on--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--that's--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--absolutely
correct,
chief
justice,
and--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--we
did
raise
it.
we
raised
it
again
throughout,
as
is
the
case
in
most
eleventh
amendment
cases
where
the
court
has
addressed
the
issues.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
because
the
removal
decision
must
be
made
very
promptly.
the
statute
requires
that
it
be
made
within,
i
believe
it's
20
or
30
days
after
you
first
learn
of
the
lawsuit.
you
don't
have
time
to
litigate
in
front
of
the
state
court,
get
rid
of
claims.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
yes.
if
the
case
was
not
removable
at
the
time,
then
it
might
have
been
deferred,
but
to
risk
the
fact
that
it
was
"not
removable"
by
failing
to
remove
at
that
time
would
have
been
a
poor
litigation
decision.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
because
the
court
had
federal
question
jurisdiction
over
all
of
the
claims
under--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--over
one
or
two
of
the
claims
made
in
the
case,
but
certainly--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--we...
it
would
have...
no
longer
have
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
claims
made
against
the
state.
however,
that's
because
of
a
defense
that's
been
interposed.
the
issue
of
original
jurisdiction,
the
issue
of
removal
jurisdiction
goes
to
the
entire
action.
that's
what
city
of
chicago
was
talking
about.
the
state
law
claims
certainly
weren't
within
the
original
jurisdiction.
it
was
only
when
we
had
the--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--mm-hmm.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
certainly--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--in
this
particular
case,
it's
not
going
to
make
much
difference.
we
can
do
it.
we
can
go
back
to
court.
we
can
handle
that,
but--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--and
we'll
prevail.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
i
know
we'll--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--why
shouldn't
it
be
done?
because
it
mixes
together
the
essential
issues
of
jurisdiction
removal
and
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
if,
in
fact,
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--i
don't
believe
that's
the
result.
we
are
asking
that
a
federal
court
look
at
those
issues
and
resolve
them.
if,
in
fact,
it's
a
dismissal
without
prejudice--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--and
if
eleventh
amendment
immunity
went
to
the
jurisdiction
of
the
court
over
an
action,
under
steel
company
it
would
always
have
to
be
addressed
first,
always.
the
court
would
never--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--i'm
not...
it
is
a
jurisdictional
issue.
jurisdictional
is
a
word
of
many,
too
many
meanings.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
it
doesn't
go
to
jurisdiction
over
the
action.
it
goes
to
jurisdiction
over
the--
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
--particular
claim.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
the...
i
don't
believe
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
jurisdiction
over
the
action
is
the
first
question.
is
this
properly
within
the
courthouse
door?
second
question.
let's
look
at
the
claims
we
have
and
the
defenses
and
see
what
happens
to
those
claims.
in
city
of
chicago
we
have
federal
claims.
therefore,
we
have
the
case
properly
within
the
courthouse
door.
next
question.
what
do
we
have
there?
we
have
some
state
law
claims
as
well.
well,
as
long
as
we've
got
federal
question
jurisdiction,
we
can
look
at
those
state
law
claims
under
pendant
and
ancillary
jurisdiction.
we
couldn't
have
if
there
weren't
any
federal
questions.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
it
does
not.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
it
was
error
to
remand
because
the
seventh
circuit
did
it
on
a
basis
of
lack
of
original
jurisdiction,
lack
of
removal
jurisdiction.
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
under
1447(c)?
mr.
richard
briles
moriarty
that
replies
again,
as
i
read
the
cases,
to
jurisdiction
over
the
action.
you've
lost
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
action
before
the
case
is
completed.
