mr.
david
e.
lasker
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
justice
souter,
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
your
concern,
because
i
do
believe
that
this
case
clearly
was
handled
correctly
by
the
seventh
circuit,
because
once
removed
to
federal
court
the
state
did
immediately
assert
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity,
and
there
certainly
the
court
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i
don't
think--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--i
think
the
problem
with
that,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
it
doesn't
pay
respect
to
the
statutes
enacted
by
congress
that
govern
this
matter.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
your
honor,
i--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--well,
your
honor,
i
do
not
agree
that
the
case
was
properly
removed
to
begin
with.
i
think
that
the
court
lacked
original
jurisdiction
under
1441(a).
i
think
we
have
a
very
unique
circumstance
here
which,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
really
hasn't
been
contemplated
by
the
explicit
language
of
any
one
of
these
statutory
provisions.
this
is
a
situation--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--i
believe
that
it
could
have
been
filed
there
only
to
give
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
to
determine
that
it
lacked
jurisdiction
because
of
the
eleventh
amendment
problem
extant
in
the
case
as
originally
filed.
of
course,
the
case
was
not
filed
in
federal
court,
and
that's
essential
to
the
case
at
bar,
but
had
the
case
been
filed
in
federal
court,
i
believe
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
would
have
only
been
to
the
extent
of
determining
under
steel
company
that
it
didn't
have
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
justice
ginsburg
was
correct
in
saying
that
what
the
state
should
have
done
in
this
situation,
or
which
would
have
been
the
simple
way
out
of
the
woods
for
this
difficult
problem
that's
presented
here,
would
have
been
for
them
to
move
to
dismiss
the
claims
that
were
supposedly
improper
claims
which
were
the
only
claims
that
presented
the
eleventh
amendment
problem.
then
they
would
have
been
able
to
remove
under
144--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--perhaps
that
would
be
true,
justice
ginsburg,
prior
to
the
decision
in
this
case,
but
this
court
will
now
reach
a
decision
which
will
speak
to
all
lawyers
and
judges
and
clarify
this
difficult
situation
where
we
have
federal
claims
that
are
eleventh
amendment-barred.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
no,
on--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--on
the
grounds
of
their
argument
that
we
failed
to
state
a
claim
under
section
1983,
but
once
they
had
established
that
we'd
failed
to
state
a
claim
against
the
state,
or
the
state
defendants
in
their
official
capacities,
they
could
have
removed.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i
believe
it's
exactly
what
congress
intended,
your
honor.
i
think
that
congress
clearly
intended
that
the
sorting
out
of
these
matters
be
done
in
state
court.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
that's
true,
your
honor,
and
i'm
quite
an
expert
on
the
eleventh
amendment
since
the
cert
petition
was
granted,
but
i
can't
say
that
i
was
beforehand.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
yes.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
well,
now
that
i've
become
an
expert
on
that
eleventh
amendment,
i
do--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--i
do
believe
that
the
case
you
cite
should
not
be
accepted
in
the
federal
court.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i
think
this
would
have
to
become
the
case,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
my
reason
for
saying
that
is
that
the
eleventh
amendment,
your
honor,
is
in
the
constitution
at
all
times,
and
it
is
in
the
nature
of
a
jurisdiction
bar,
as
this
court
said
in--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--if
that
party
is
dropped
out,
then
the
bar
to
federal
jurisdiction
would
be
gone,
and
then
under
1446(b)
it
could
be
removed
to
federal
court.
if
removal
to
federal
court--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--thank
you--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--thank
you,
because
i
really
think
that
it's
important
to
underscore
that
city
of
chicago
involved
state
claims
that
were
attached
under
the
court's
pendant
or
supplemental
jurisdiction.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
correct.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
well,
your
honor,
the
difference
between
state
claims,
state
law
claims
and
federal
claims
that
may
be
barred
under
the
eleventh
amendment
is
a
distinction
that
i
think
is
important
here,
and...
but
certainly--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--that
does
not
pay
homage,
your
honor,
to
the
language
of
1447(c),
which
says
that
when
the
court
lacks
subject
matter
jurisdiction
the
case
shall
be
remanded.
there's
not
authority
to
remand
individual
claims,
and--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--but
this
contains
claims
of
federal
law,
justice
ginsburg,
some
of
which
may
not
be
brought
in
federal
court
but
all
of
which
may
be
brought
in
state
court,
and--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--the...
i
guess
i--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--of
course,
yes,
and
this
entire
action
was
properly
brought
in
state
court.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
your
honor,
i
think
what
i'm
recommending
to
this
court
is
that
you
announce
a
doctrine
in
handling
this
case
that
is
true
to
the
unambiguous
language
of
the
statutes,
that
is...
that
honors
the
principles
of
federalism
under
the
eleventh
amendment
and
article
iii,
and
that
applies
a
doctrine
that
is
efficient
and
simple
to
understand
for
lawyers
and
judges,
and
that,
i
submit
to
you,
is
exactly
what
the
seventh
circuit
did
in
this
case.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
well,
i
think--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--i
don't
have
a
case
to
cite
for
that
proposition,
and
this
case
does
not
raise
those
facts,
of
course,
but--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--your
honor,
the
fact
is
that
we're
dealing
here
with
a
hybrid
type
of
case
that
is
not...
has
not
been
addressed
foursquare
before
in
any
situation
that
i'm
aware
of,
and
that
is
a
case
where
you
have
federal
claims
that
are
not
barred
by
the
eleventh
amendment
coupled
with
federal
claims
that
are
barred
by
the--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
on
behalf
of
my
client
i
had
a
right
as
the
plaintiff's
counsel
to
file
this
case
in
state
court,
which
is
how
this
question
comes
here
from
the
seventh
circuit,
and--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--because
i
don't
think
that
congress
intended
to
bifurcate
the
litigation
in
that
fashion.
i
think
that
piecemeal
removal--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--all
right.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
yes.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i
suppose
the
answer
to
that
question
would
be
yes,
and
that
does--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--then
draw
the
importance
of
the
fact
that
this
case
arises
out
of
my
choice
to
sue
in
state
court
and
then
the
defendant's
procedural
maneuver
that
was
disapproved
of
in
this
case
and
that
was
of
concern
to
the
seventh
circuit
in
frances
j.,
that
the
defendants
remove
a
case
of
that
sort
from
state
court
to
federal
court
really
for
the
purpose
of
separating
the
prospective
relief
claims
from
the--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--okay.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
well--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--well,
the
statute
that
disposes
of
this
case
is
1447(c).
mr.
david
e.
lasker
that's
my
position,
justice
stevens.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i
believe
it
would,
but
i
think
that
that
would
deal
with
the
kind
of
case
that
we've
got
here
in
the
most
efficient
way--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--i
do
assert
that
it
should
not
have
been
accepted
under
the
court's
original
jurisdiction,
and
i
say
that
whether
i'm
right
about
that
or
not,
justice
scalia,
certainly
when
the
state
asserted
its
eleventh
amendment
defenses
in
federal
court,
then
clearly
under
1447(c)
the
federal
court
lacked
subject
matter
jurisdiction
and
was
right
to
send
the
entire
case
back,
not
just
the--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--no,
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
no,
there
isn't,
but--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--that's...
my
answer
to
you
is
correct,
but
i
again
have
to
ask
you
not
to
hang
me
on
my
answer
to
that
question--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--no,
it
doesn't
seem
to
be,
your
honor,
so
that's
the
situation
we're
stuck
with.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
well,
it...
there
is
a
sovereign
immunity
statute
in
the
state
court
for
state
claims.
i'm
not
sure
exactly
where
in
my
brief
you're
referring,
but--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--that's
what
i
was
referring
to.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
they
do,
but
i
was...
but
the
state
immunity
is,
i
believe,
abrogated
by
section
1983,
although
a
state
is
not
a
person
under
section
1983
since
will.
what
i
was
talking
about,
however,
is
that
the
action
as
it
was
brought
would
have
been
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
state
court
and
was
not
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
court
for
the
reason
of
the
existence
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i
do
have
a
theory,
your
honor,
that
i
seek
to
assert
in
the
state
court
upon
remand,
that
we
do
have
a
claim
under
the
wisconsin
constitution
that
would
not
be
barred
by
the
state
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
yes,
sir.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
that's
correct.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i
just...
i
don't
know
that
anything
stands
in
the
way
of
that
except
stare
decisis.
i
think
that
the
finney
case
and
other
cases
that
are
cited
in
the
brief
do
stand
for
the
proposition
that
the
waiver
has
to
be
an
explicit
act
of
the
sovereign
state
and
not
just
something
that
happens
because
of
the
strategic
decision
by
an
assistant
attorney
general,
for
example.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
well,
it
would
seem
clear
to
me,
your
honor,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
ever
been
considered
to
be
a
proper
waiver
of
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
perhaps
not.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i'm
not
an
authority
on
that.
i--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--i'd
say
that--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--well,
i
do
say
that--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--that
the
case
should
not
have
been
accepted
into
federal
court
until
the
state
court--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--had
sorted
out
the
claims--
mr.
david
e.
lasker
--well,
i
don't
know
that
wisconsin
law
is
as
mr.
moriarty
asserts.
i'm
going
to
accept
his
word
on
that,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
be
difficult
for
the
state
to
waive
and
get
a
statute
enacted
by
the
legislature.
mr.
david
e.
lasker
i
think
that's
at
least
clear
in
determining
the
application
of
1447(c)
to
the
facts
in
this
case.
however,
i
am
arguing
that
i
think
the
problem
exists
in
the
case
of
whether
the
court
has
original
jurisdiction
under
1441(a),
and
that
the
best
rule
would
be
to
require
that
the
state
court
dismiss
any
claims
that
would
otherwise
be
barred
in
the
eleventh
amendment
before
removal
could
occur.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
then
i'll
sit
down.
thank
you
very
much.
