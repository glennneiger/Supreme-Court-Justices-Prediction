the
other
case
85-1589,
iowa
mutual
insurance
company
against
laplante.
a
blackfeet
indian
sued
his
employer
in
tribal
court.
the
employer's
insurer
sought
a
declaration
from
the
federal
district
court
that
the
insurance
policy
did
not
cover
this
play.
the
district
court
dismissed
for
the
lack
of
subject-matter
jurisdiction
and
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
affirmed.
while
we
agree
with
much
of
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning,
we
reverse
its
judgment
in
so
far
as
it
affirmed
the
district
court's
dismissal
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
justice
stevens
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
dissenting
part.
