justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
davis,
just
to
clarify,
maybe
it
is
covered
in
your
briefs,
but
in
your
view
what
jurisdiction's
substantive
law
governs
the
decision
of
the
coverage
question?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
montana.
your
opponent
presumably
would
agree.
and
what
substantive
rule
of
law
governs
the
negligence
action?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
it
not
be
possible
that
the
tribe
could
decide
as
a
matter
of
its
own
law
that
the
failure
to
get
workman's
compensation
somehow
establishes
liability
as
a
matter
of
tribal
law
or
something
like
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
at
least
their
complaint
does.
whether
the
tribal
court
would
do
that
we
still
don't
know.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
on
your
suggestion
that
we
start
from
scratch,
in
effect,
and
redefine
the
jurisdictional
boundary,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
boundaries
are
mutually
exclusive,
that
you
are
in
the
indian
camp,
you
can't
come
in
state
court,
and
vice
versa?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
would
say
that
if
there
is
jurisdiction
in
the
tribal
court
under
your
new
definition
of
the
boundary
there
would
be
no
jurisdiction
in
either
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
exclusive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bottomly,
let
me
stop
you
right
there,
because
is
this
the
identical
dispute?
in
the
tribal
court
you
have
a
negligence
claim.
here
you
have
a
coverage
claim.
aren't
they
quite
different,
and
isn't
your
opponent
right
that
that
frequently
is...
those
two
claims
are
adjudicated
in
different
courts?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
aspect
of
it
overlaps,
but
the
negligence
aspect
doesn't
overlap.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
the
requirement
that
people
who
practice
before
tribal
court
be
lawyers?
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
the
bar,
you
don't
mean
the
bar
of
montana,
you
mean
the
tribal
bar?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
one
question
that
runs
through
my
mind
as
i
listen
to
your
argument?
i
believe
i
am
correct
in
assuming
that
it
the
basic
negligence
action
were
in
a
state
court
rather
than
a
tribal
court
it
would
be
permissible
to
bring
a
federal
diversity
case
to
decide
the
coverage
question.
i
don't
think
you
challenge
that,
do
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
what
you
are
in
effect
saying
is
that
the
tribal
court
has
kind
of
a
greater
immunity
from
interference
with
its
own
procedures
than
a
state
court
would
have.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
a
way
it
has
sort
of
a
greater
degree
of
sovereignty,
you
might
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
not
suggesting
congress
has
addressed
this
precise
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
can't
do
it
in...
they
may
not
be
able
to
do
it
in
state
court
because
it
doesn't
have
diversity...
well,
there
is
always
distinction
in
any
diversity
case.
the
plaintiff
has
a
right
that
a
resident
plaintiff
would
not
have.
you
have
that
differential
always.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
except
on
the
coverage
question
i
suppose
in
the
future
the
insurance
companies
may
write
in
a
clause
in
their
contracts
deciding
what
law
applies,
and
i
suppose
the
tribes
would
honor
it.
i
am
not
sure.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
just
one
other
question?
am
i
correct
in
assuming
that
if
this
happens,
say
the
tribal
court
reviewed
the
matter
and
said,
we
think
we
have
jurisdiction
to
decide
coverage
questions
like
this
but
we
decide
as
a
matter
of
discretion
that
we
would
rather
have
an
experienced
federal
judge
address
this
complicated
question
of
interpreting
insurance
policies,
so
we
will
decline
to
exercise
our
jurisdiction
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
i
take
it
the
federal
court
would
then
have
jurisdiction.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
springing
use,
to
use
the
chief
justice's
phrase,
for
federal
jurisdiction
would
depend
on
either
of
two
things,
one,
that
the
tribal
court
had
no
jurisdiction,
or
secondly,
it
declined
to
exercise
it
as
a
matter
of
discretion.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that
is
precisely
the
risk
they
take
if
there
was
a
pending
state
proceeding,
the
risk
of
conflicting
jurisdictions.
