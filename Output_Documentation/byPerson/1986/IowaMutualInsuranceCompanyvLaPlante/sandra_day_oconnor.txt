mr.
bottomly,
do
you
think
that
the
federal
district
court
actually
had
jurisdiction
but
just
as
a
matter
of
comity
it
should
or
did
dismiss
or
abstain
from
hearing
it
pending
the
resolution
of
the
issue
in
the
tribal
court?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
you
suppose
the
district
court
actually
had
jurisdiction?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
certainly
isn't
the
view
expressed
by
the
solicitor
general,
is
it?
