justice

what
is
the
good
news,
mr.
davis?
justice
antonin
scalia
workable
framework
that
you
would
be
able
to
bring
suit
in
federal
court
if
you
are
an
out
of
state
insurance
company,
but
if
you
are
an
in-state
insurance
company
you
can't
bring
suit
in
state
court
nor
in
federal
court,
of
course,
because
there
is
no
diversity.
is
that
workable?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
line
between
this
case
and
allowing
the
person
who
opens
a
trading
post
on
an
indian
reservation
to
sue
in
state
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
asserting
that
so
long
as
one
of
the
parties
is
a
non-indian
it
doesn't
go
to
tribal
courts.
that
is
the
line
you
want
to
draw.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
the
non-indian...
even
in
williams,
even
if
it
were
a
case
where
the
non-indian
is
running
a
trading
post
on
the
reservation.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
davis,
let's
assume
we
don't
accept
that
broad
invitation
of
yours,
and
we
adhere
to
the
proposition
that
the
tribal
court
would
have
jurisdiction
or
at
least
arguably
would
have
jurisdiction
here.
you
have
another
string
to
your
bow,
i
gather.
you
would
say
even
in
that
event
the
mere
fact
that
they
might
have
jurisdiction
does
not
preclude
our
accepting
jurisdiction
under
the
federal
diversity
provision.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
tell
me
why
that
ought
to
be
so,
not
just
in
light
of
the
national
farmers
home
case,
but
also
in
light
of
the
fact
that
federal
courts
will
often
refrain
from
exercising
diversity
jurisdiction
when
state
courts
are
entertaining
the
same
suit.
even
with
respect
to
state
courts
we
will
sometimes
stay
our
hand,
although
we
technically
have
diversity
jurisdiction.
why
should
we
treat
tribal
courts
in
a
more
unfavorable
fashion
than
we
would
treat
state
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
we
should
have
accepted
this
case
if
it
had
walked
in
without
any
prior
proceeding
in
the
tribal
courts,
but
here
you
have
a
proceeding
already
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
that
suit
had
been
in
state
court
and
then
this
same
diversity
suit
were
attempted.
do
you
think
the
federal
court
would
go
ahead
with
a
separate
diversity
action
duplicating
the
state
court
action.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
allow
the
indian--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
williams
to
bring
that
suit
in
state
court
if
he
wanted
to?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
the
indian.
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
the
indian
was
suing
the
store
owners.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
the
tribal
court
finds
that
it
doesn't
have
jurisdiction?
justice
antonin
scalia
does
not.
is
that
reviewable
in
federal
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
up
to
the
tribal
court.
they
can
take
jurisdiction.
they
can
just
decline
jurisdiction
where
they
sort
of
parcel
it
out
to
the
federal
courts,
we
don't
want
this
one.
it
is
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
is
not
quite
exactly,
because
the
typical
state
long
arm
statute
has
the
effect
of
extending
that
state's
or
restricting
that
state's
jurisdiction
but
it
does
not
simultaneously
affect
the
jurisdiction
of
other
states,
much
less
of
the
federal
government,
but
here
you
are
asserting
that
the
tribal
court
not
only
can
determine
its
own
jurisdiction
but
in
that
very
act
can
determine
the
jurisdiction
of
the
federal
government
and
of
other
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
but
that
is
a
strange...
that
is
a
whole
lot
of
power
to
give
to
the
tribal
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
self-government
doesn't
necessarily
include
the
exclusion
of
jurisdiction
by
other
sovereigns
over
matters
arising
there.
i
mean,
states
have
self-government
and
yet
there
are
transitory
causes
of
action
that
are
tried
in
other
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
guess
the
difference
is
that
the
transitory
cause
of
action
from
one
state
to
another,
it
is
still
the
first
state's
law
that
would
continue
to
follow
it,
assuming
anybody
could
agree
on
choice
of
law
rules--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whereas
you
say
when
you
oust
the
tribal
council
of
adjudicative
authority
you
are
also
ousting
the
tribe's
substantive
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
magic
language
that
determines
whether
mr.
davis's
argument
about
the
tribal
court
should
only
have
jurisdiction
between
indians
and
between
an
indian
and
someone
else
resident
on
the
reservation?
what
statutory
language
governs
the
scope
of
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
just
all
it
says,
arise
on
the
reservation?
