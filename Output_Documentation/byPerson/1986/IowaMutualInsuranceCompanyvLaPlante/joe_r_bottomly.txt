mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
ninth
circuit
and
the
district
court
were
correct
in
the
dismissing
of
this
case
because
to
take
diversity
jurisdiction
when
there
is
a
pending
action
in
tribal
court
which
involves
the
identical
issues
and
disputes
would
contradict
the
firm
federal
policy
to
promote
tribal
self-government--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--they
are
identical
claims
because
iowa
mutual
as
an
affirmative
defense
raised
the
coverage
question.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
right,
but
the
part
of
the
declaratory
in
federal
court
that
they
want
determined,
that
is
the
insurance
contract
issues.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
they
are
pending
in
tribal
court
in
a
motion
for
summary
judgment.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
we
moved
for
summary
judgment
on--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--yes.
iowa
mutual--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--there
are
two
actions.
there
is
a
negligence
auto
accident
which
involves
the
indian
defendant,
indian
plaintiff,
and
there
is
a
bad
faith
insurance
adjusting
action
which
involves
iowa
mutual
and
their
insurance
adjustor,
midland
claims,
so
there
are
two
counts
in
tribal
court.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
the
tribal
court
determined
it
had
jurisdiction
because
iowa
mutual
came
on
the
reservation
and
did
business
with
the
wellmans.
now,
it
is
true
their
office
is
located
off,
but
their
activities
include
actions
on
the
reservation
including
coming
on
and
cataloguing
this
ranching
business.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that
is
right.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
they
did
move
their
tribal
court
to
dismiss,
but
the
tribal
court
has
determined
that
it
does
have
jurisdiction.
the
basis
of
the--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
right.
the
tribal
court
at
the
trial
level
has
determined
it
does
have
jurisdiction
over
iowa
mutual
based
on
the
montana
case.
now,
the
appeals
council
in
the
blackfeet
tribe
hasn't
had
an
opportunity
to
look
at
that
yet.
and
they
won't
have
the
opportunity
until
a
final
judgment
on
the
merits
is
reached
in
the
tribal
court.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
well,
the
way
that
arose,
at
the
time
we
filed
this
action
the
montana
supreme
court
appeared
to
say
that
you
could
do
that,
you
could
bring
an
action,
a
bad
faith
action
at
the
same
time.
but
subsequent
to
that
the
montana
supreme
court
has
made
it
clear
you
can't.
so
iowa
mutual
has
made
a
motion
in
blackfeet
tribe
to
sever,
and
that
is
pending
in
blackfeet
court.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
well,
we
don't
know
exactly.
the
code
says
this.
the
code
says
it
follows
the
federal
government,
and
then
tribal
custom
and
law,
and
then...
which
isn't
in
conflict
with
federal
law,
and
then
it
can
look
to
the
state
law.
it
doesn't
have
to
follow
the
state
law
but
it
can
look
to
it.
so
when
we
are
drafting
our
complaint
we
often
use
state
law
because
we
don't
find
it
in
the
tribal
codes
or
we
don't
know
what
the
common
law
of
the
tribe
is
at
that
point.
actually,
any
reservation
or
state
that
has
a
small
population
and
doesn't
have
a
big
common
law
has
the
same
problem.
you
don't
know
exactly
what
the
common
law
is
going
to
be
until
they
rule.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
the
appeals
council
or
the
trial
level?
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
the
trial
court
acts
very
much
like
a
state
court.
it
has
one
judge
and
then
it
has
a
jury.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
he
is
appointed.
in
this
case,
he
is
a
special
judge
coming
over
from
another
reservation.
he
is
actually
a
judge
coming
from
the
cootney
salick
tribe.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
yes,
although
he
doesn't
have
to
be
lawyer.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
well,
they
take
a
training
course.
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act,
in
fact,
it
provides
for
the
training
of
judges.
but
they
don't
have
to
be
a
lawyer.
but
they
do
receive
some
training.
in
fact,
in
montana
the
justice
of
the
peaces--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--i
believe
five.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
i
am
not
sure.
they
have
to
be
members
of
the
bar
unless
they
have
an
associate
who
is
a
member
of
the
bar,
and
you
have
to
take
a
bar
exam.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
right.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
no,
i
am
not.
i
was
associated
because
one
of
the
persons
on
this
case
is
a
member
of
the
bar,
so
i
was
privileged
to
be
able
to
practice
with
her
through
association.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
yes.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
by
taking
the
bar
exam.
mr.
davis
is
a
member.
it
is
important
to
note
the
evolution
of
tribal
law
has
gone
beyond
the
mere
recognition
of
tribal
sovereignty,
which
has
been
recognized,
of
course,
since
the
mid-1800s,
and
has
now,
both
congress
and
the
common
law
has
actively
promoted
tribal
sovereignty
on
the
one
hand
and
tribal
development
of
institutions,
and
also
offered
some
measure
of
protection
for
these
fledgling
institutions
to
develop,
and
this
steps
from
the
realization
that
tribal
institutions
have
to
participate
in
order
to
develop,
and
that
there
has
to
be
some
recognition
of
the
distinct
cultural
and
political
situation
they
are
in,
they
are
isolated
units.
congress
has
shown
this
promotion
by
a
number
of
statutes
like
the
indian
jurisdiction
act,
the
indian
financing
act,
the
indian
self-determination
and
education
act,
all
of
which
takes
lets
the
tribes
take
the
lead
in
developing
their
own
policy
and
implementing,
and
have
offered
some
measure
of
protection
by
the
indian
civil
rights
act
which
requires
the
consent
of
the
tribes
before
the
states
can
take
jurisdiction
over
actions
which
arise
on
the
reservation.
now,
the
courts
have
followed
that
and
implemented
that
policy
and
it
has
two
results.
one
is
a
preemption
of
the
states
from
exercising
intrusive
jurisdiction
in
those
areas
which
are
properly
within
the
traditional
retained
sovereignty
of
the
tribes,
and
secondly,
there
has
been
a
limitation
of
federal
courts
as
a
matter
of
common
law
to
exercise
intrusive
jurisdiction
unless
congress
has
made
it
clear
that
it
intended
that
to
occur.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
well,
that's
the...
it
is
difficult
to
tell.
certainly
the
ninth
circuit
talked
about
jurisdiction.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
my
view
is
that
they
did
not--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--our
view
is
that
they
did
not
have
jurisdiction,
but
if
the
tribal
court
is
determined
not
to
have
jurisdiction,
that
they
would.
in
other
words,
we
take
the
view
that
woods
versus
interstate
would
preclude
the
tribal
court
from...
i
mean,
the
district
court
from
jurisdiction.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
no,
it
isn't.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
result
but
for
different
reasons.
we
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
result
in
that
we
agree
that
the
district
court
would
have
jurisdiction
but
for
different
reasons.
we
would
agree
with
the
ninth
circuit
that
the
interference
doctrine
would
be
the
doctrine
which
would
come
into
play,
and
if
the
tribal
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction
probably
the
state
court
would
at
that
point
and
so
the
district
court,
federal
court
would,
too.
we
would
part
company
at
that
point
with
the
tribal's
amici.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
right.
that's
our
view,
because
i
think
that
is
the
only
way
you
can
make
a
symmetrical
result
between
the
ability
of
the
citizen
of
montana
to
use...
go
into
tribal
court...
he
would
have
to
go
into
tribal
court.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
right,
there's
no
question.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
well,
it
is
reviewable
under
28.1331,
under
national
farmers
union,
after
the
remedies
in
trial
court.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
right.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
federal
question.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
true.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
it
is
a
little
strange,
but
the
reason
why
it
would
have
diversity
jurisdiction
at
that
point
is
because
the
tribal
court
didn't.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
does
not?
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
no,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
i
think
the
review
that
the
federal
court
would
have
is
the
outer
boundaries
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction.
tribal
courts,
like
state
courts,
would
be
the
final
arbiters
within
that
boundary.
they
would
be
able
to
be
the
final
arbiters
of
whether
or
not
in
fact
they
had
jurisdiction
or
what
their
codes
say
or
what
their
constitution
says,
but
the
federal
court
can
determine
the
outer
boundary,
did
they
exceed
their
jurisdiction
as
a
tribe.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
exactly,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
to
some
extent,
although
it
is
only
the
outer
boundaries.
in
other
words,
if
the--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--the
reason
why
we
disagree
with
the
solicitor
general
on
the
reasoning
is
because
if
it
wasn't
so
it
would
have
a
lot
of
can
of
worms
in
the
conflict
of
law
and
equal
protection
area.
as
a
general
matter,
in
other
words,
if
a
citizen
of
montana
has
to
go
into
tribal
court
and
apply
tribal
law,
whereas
a
citizen
who
isn't
a
citizen
of
montana,
like
iowa
mutual,
can
take
advantage
of
diversity
and
apparently
apply
montana
state
law.
so
to
have
some
sort
of
uniformity
the
ninth
circuit's
argument
seems
to
us
to
be
the
most
realistic,
and
it
also
brings
in
the
interference
doctrine,
which
we
think
is
the
touchstone
for
the
jurisdiction
issue.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
i
think
that's
right,
although
as
justice--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--it
does,
because--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--not
a
greater
degree
of
sovereignty,
but
congress
has
intended
it
to
have
a
greater
degree
of
protection
from
more
developed
institutions
that
might
usurp
that
power.
and
the
reason
why
is,
they
wanted
them
to
develop,
so
it
doesn't
necessarily
have
more
sovereignty.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
no,
it
hasn't
but
its
policy
and
the
other
statutes
has
indicated
that
it
doesn't
want
actions
which
arise
on
the
reservation
to
be
brought
in
state
court,
and
here
is
nothing
in
the
statute
or
common
law
or
surrounding
circumstance
which
indicates
congress
intended
for
the
petitioner
to
go
through
federal
court
and
do
what
it
can't
do
in
state
court,
and
that
is
circumvent
the
tribal
court.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that
is
right.
the
difference,
though,
in
this
case
would
be
at
least
in
diversity
cases,
erie
versus
tompkins
and
the
rules
of
decision
act
would
make
the
state
law
of
the
state
applicable.
there
is
no
analogous
statute
which
would
make
the
tribal
court
law
applicable
in
federal
district
court,
so
not
only
are
you
interfering
with
actual
proceedings
but
you
may
have
completely
different
results
because
tribal
law
may
be
different
from
the
state
law
and
the
out
of
state
resident
can
take
advantage
of
that.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that
may
be
true.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
true,
but
the
statute
was--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--well,
the
diversity
statute
was
written
in
1789,
long
before
indians
were
citizens
of
the
united
states.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
not
necessarily,
no.
the
reason
why
it
would
be
here
is
because
of
the
unique
relationship
between
tribal
courts
or
tribes
and
the
federal
government,
and
congress's
intent
to
provide
some
measure
of
protection
for
the
tribal
courts
to
develop,
so
there
is
a
difference
between
tribal
courts.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
well,
in
the
acts
like
the
indian
jurisdiction
act,
the
self-determination
act,
the
indian
financing
act,
they
expressly
state
they
want
to
promote
tribal
self-government.
they
expressly
indicate
they
want
the
tribes
to
take
the
lead,
and
in
the
indian
civil
rights
act
they
expressly
prohibit
the
states
from
taking
those
actions,
so
yes,
the
diversity
statute
doesn't
address
that
but
the
other
policy
statutes
seem
to
talk
about
that
issue.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
true,
but
congress
in
public
law
280
excluded
states
from
taking
causes
of
action
which
arise
on
the
reservation.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
right.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
right.
you
don't
have
the
rules
of
decision
act,
at
least
in
federal
court,
although
the
general
conflict
of
laws
would
seem
to
indicate
that
the
tribal
laws
should
apply.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
well,
public
law
280
talks
about
causes
of
action
which
arise
on
the
reservation.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
arise
on
the
reservation.
and
so
it
is
like
a
long
arm
statute.
if
iowa
mutual
comes
on
the
reservation
and
has
voluntary
commercial
transactions
there
or
if
it
does
other
things
that
directly
affect
the
tribal
council
itself
or
tribal
members,
then
maybe
the
tribe
would
have
jurisdiction
if
it
arose
there.
now,
admittedly,
though
this
court
doesn't
have
to
address
this
here,
if
the
tribal
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction,
we
would
say
that
the
federal
court
could
because
there
would
be
no
interference,
in
this
case
there
are
some
jurisdictional
actions
which
take
place
off
the
reservation.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
right.
the
federal
court
at
that
time
would
have
to--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--that
is
true.
at
that
point
we
would
have
to
have
the
federal
court
determine
where
did
this
action
arise,
and
if
it
arose
on
the
reservation,
then
they
would
stay
the
proceeding
or
they
would
dismiss
until
that
was
determined
in
the
tribal
court,
whether
the
tribal
court
had
jurisdiction.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
in
this
case
i
would
say
yes.
kennerly
might
indicate
and
the
fisher
cases
might
indicate
that
there
are
some
types
of
issues
which
are
so
intrinsically
bound
up
into
tribal
issues
that
the
state
court
or
the
federal
court
wouldn't
take
jurisdiction,
but
in
this
case--
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
--yes,
that
is
at
least
what
the
three
affiliated
tribes
case
tells
me,
that
if
the
tribal
court
doesn't
exercise
its
jurisdiction
in
that
area,
there
isn't
interference
with
the
tribal
court
to
bring
it
in
state
or
federal
court.
even
if
we
assume
there
is
technical
diversity
jurisdiction,
national
farmers
union
versus
crow
tribe
seems
to
tell
us
that
we
should
defer
to
the
tribal
court
at
least
in
the
first
instance
to
determine
the
issues
and
its
own
jurisdiction.
now,
iowa
mutual
hasn't
directly
attacked
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction
in
this
action,
although
they
have
in
another
action.
that
issue,
as
iowa
mutual
admits
in
its
brief,
is
bound
up
because
if
the
federal
district
court
takes
the
issue
it
has
got
to
to
do
one
of
two
things.
it
has
either
got
to
take
the
issue
away
from
the
tribal
court
and
in
that
case
undermine
its
authority
by
taking
the
issue
away,
or
it
has
got
to
create
a
risk
of
conflicting
adjudications
between
the
federal
court
and
the
tribal
court,
and
that
would
also
tend
to
undermine
the
authority
of
the
tribal
court
because
there
would
be
some
difficulty
in
enforcing
the
judgment.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
yes.
and
also
to
accept
diversity
jurisdiction
would
undermine
the
lawmaking
authority
of
the
tribe
because
you
apply
state
law,
unlike
state
courts,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
or
the
surrounding
circumstances
that
say
congress
intended
that
to
be
so.
they
have
been
uniformly
silent
with
regard
to
their
intent
on
the
diversity
statute,
and
the
implication
from
silence
can
be
seen
in
many
cases
by
this
court,
and
that
is
that
when
congress
is
silent
the
tribal
sovereignty
or
the
tribal
jurisdiction
remains
intact,
as
it
said
in
merrion
versus
jicarilla
apache
tribe.
mr.
joe
r.
bottomly
that's
true,
but
santa
clara
pueblo
versus
martinez
tells
us
that
even
when
there
is
a
statute
which
talks
about
indian
civil
rights
in
that
case,
that
federal
courts
will
hesitate
to
imply
an
action
there.
that
was
a
declaratory
action
for
equal
protection.
and
that
they
will
hold
back
unless
it
is
clear
that
congress
intended
it
to
be
so,
but
citizenship
has
never
been
a
factor
or
criteria
by
which
the
extent
of
sovereignty
or
the
abrogation
of
sovereignty
of
tribes
has
been
judged.
in
fact,
in
u.s.
versus
neece,
which
was
an
early
case,
1916,
that
involved
u.s.
citizenship
earlier
than
the
1924
statute.
the
court
said,
"citizenship
doesn't
abrogate
the
unique
relationship
between
the
tribes
and
the
federal
government
which
give
rise
to
the
rules
of
statutory
construction
involving
tribal
court
jurisdiction.
"
further
evidence
of
congress's
lack
of
intent
to
circumvent
the
tribal
court
through
diversity
is,
of
course,
the
conflict
of
laws
problem
which
we
discussed
and
the
equal
protection
problems
between
the
citizen
of
montana
and
the
citizen
of
another
state
that
we
talked
about.
and
finally,
of
course,
while
it
is
not
binding
on
this
court,
it
should
be
noted
that
the
basis
of
the
petitioner's
writ
of
certiorari,
that
is,
the
conflict
between
the
eighth
and
ninth
circuit,
has
evaporated
if
not
completely,
to
a
great
extent
because
the
eighth
circuit
subsequent
to
the
grant
of
writ
of
certiorari
has
adopted
the
ninth
circuit's
reasoning
in
r.j.
williams.
that
is,
the
interference
doctrine
limiting
courts,
non-indian
courts
from
intruding
on
tribal
jurisdiction,
applies
to
both
federal
courts
and
state
courts.
and
so
there
does
not
appear
to
be
a
conflict
there
as
there
was
at
least
when
this
cert
was
granted.
that
is
all
i
have.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
sit
down.
