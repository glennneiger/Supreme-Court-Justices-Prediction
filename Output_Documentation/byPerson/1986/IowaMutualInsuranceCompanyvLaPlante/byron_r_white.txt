what
about
the
school
district
last
year?
justice
byron
r.
white
well
i
know,
but
you
would
say
that
state
courts
have
jurisdiction
even
if
the
person
who
resides
off
the
reservation
still
resides
in
the
state.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
the
school
district?
justice
byron
r.
white
school
district
resides
on
a
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
the
school
district
exists
off
the
reservation
and
goes
on
the
reservation
to
pick
up
indian
children
and
there
gets
to
be
a
dispute
about
that--
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
agree
that
the
tribal
court
would
be
the
proper
forum
to
try
out
the
argument
between
the
laplantes
and
the
wellmans?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
is
just
that
the
wellmans
had
some
insurance.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
they
had
gotten
through
a
broker
off
the
reservation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
your
client
provided
the
insurance.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
tribal
court
have
ever
gotten
jurisdiction
over
the
insurance
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
insurance
company
has
no
existence
on
the
reservation
but
it
does
have
offices
off
the
reservation
and
within
the
state.
the
tribal
court
still
can't
get
jurisdiction
over
them,
can
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
ninth
circuit
dismissed
the
case,
ordered
the
case
dismissed,
completely
dismissed.
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
it
held
that
since
the
state
courts
wouldn't
have
jurisdiction,
that
there
wasn't
any
diversity
jurisdiction
either.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
ordered
the
case
dismissed.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
iowa,
the
insurance
company
a
party
to
the
tribal
court
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
you
get
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
how
did
you
get
jurisdiction
over
the
insurance
company?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
is
sort
of
a
long-arm
jurisdiction?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
iowa
and
the
insurance
company
came
in
and
didn't
object
to
jurisdiction,
i
guess.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
they
didn't
object
to
personal
jurisdiction.
justice
byron
r.
white
subject
matter.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
if
the
state
courts
don't
have
jurisdiction
there
is
no
diversity
jurisdiction.
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
tribal
court
decides
it
has
jurisdiction.
that
decision
is
reviewable,
isn't
it,
in
the
federal
court
somewhere?
justice
byron
r.
white
where?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
federal
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
a
diversity
case.
or
is
that
a
federal
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
congress
has
expressed
its
intent
pretty
clearly
with
respect
to
diversity
jurisdiction.
you
say
congress
hasn't
addressed
a
specific
question
but
it
has
in
the
sense
that
it
has
provided
for
diversity
jurisdiction
in
federal
courts.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
the
tribal
courts,
as
justice
stevens
asked,
get
more
deference
than
state
courts?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
this
diversity
action...
ordinarily
a
diversity
action
in
a
federal
court
isn't
stayed
until
you
exhaust
your
remedies
in
a
state
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
where
do
you
find
that.
you
said
it
hadn't
really
addressed
this
question
expressly.
justice
byron
r.
white
even
if
there
wasn't
the
second
lawsuit
pending
in
the
tribal
court,
that
if
the
insurance
company
brings
this
action
in
the
federal
court
that
you
should
be
able
to
go
in
and
say
please
dismiss
or
stay
until
i
can
bring
a
suit
and
exhaust
my
remedies
before
the
tribal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
you
could
never
get
done
if
it
were...
if
you
were
talking
about
just
a
state
court.

well,
now,
did
i
understand
your
opponent
to
say
that
this
bad
faith
action
cannot
go
forward
in
montana
courts
any
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
that's
what
i
mean.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
i
understand.
