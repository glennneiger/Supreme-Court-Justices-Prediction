mr.
maxon
r.
davis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court,
we
have
today
another
indian
case
from
montana.
the
last
time
that
you
had
an
opportunity
to
hear
a
case
from
our
jurisdiction
was
another
indian
case,
national
farmers
union
insurance
company
versus
the
crow
tribe
of
indians.
that
was
way
back
in
1985.
at
that
time
justice
stevens,
speaking
for
a
unanimous
court,
described
the
case
as
a
kind
of
procedural
nightmare.
of
course,
that
was
a
federal
question
case
under
section
1331
of
title
28.
in
the
intervening
12
or
13
months
you
have
also
had
an
opportunity
to
decide
the
three
affiliated
tribes
versus
wold
case
from
north
dakota,
which,
of
course,
was
a
public
law
280
case,
and
the
interesting
feature
of
that
case
was
that
it
was
kind
of
a
jurisdictional
yo-yo.
you
had
it,
i
believe,
two
times,
and
now
iowa
mutual's
case
comes
before
this
court,
a
diversity
case
involving
indians.
it
presents
the
problem
of
reconciling
what
we
view
as
an
unequivocal
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction
under
section
1332,
constitutional
in
origin,
reconciling
that
grant
with
the
perceived
limitations
of
federal
indian
policy.
the
solution
suggested
by
the
ninth
circuit,
go
ask
the
tribal
court.
we
do
not
feel
that
it
is
appropriate
to
go
ask
the
tribal
court
the
extent
of
your
jurisdiction,
nor
is
it
necessary.
by
placing
this
particular
case,
the
one
that
we
are
arguing
about
this
morning,
in
this
limited
historical
context,
i
am
simply
trying
to
reinforce
a
conclusion
that
i
guess
i
had
been
dealing
with
implicitly
for
the
ten
odd
years
that
i
have
been
practicing
law
in
montana,
and
that
this
case
has
served
to
crystallize,
and
the
conclusion
is
this,
quite
simply.
federal
indian
law
as
it
exists
primarily
based
on
court
decisions
from
this
tribunal
for
the
most
part
it
doesn't
work.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
it
is
bad
news.
it
is
bad
news
for
litigants
like
iowa
mutual
or
national
farmers
union
insurance
company
but
it
is
also
bad
news
for
the
reservation
indians
to
whom
the
federal
government
and
certainly
this
court
has
shown
so
much
solicitude.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
the
good
news,
justice
scalia,
is
that
you
have
an
opportunity
to
fix
it,
and
i
hope
to...
we
can
take
some
small
steps
today
towards
fixing
it,
and
i
guess
the
point
i
want
to
stress
is
that
certainly
in
dealing
with
theory
and
with
concepts
like
federal
preemption
and
the
retained
sovereignty
of
indian
tribes
with
which
this
court
grapples,
it
is
necessary
to
keep
in
mind
that
we
foot
soldiers
like
mr.
bottomly
and
i
out
in
the
trenches
in
great
falls
or
wherever,
in
browning,
montana,
have
to
apply
these
concepts
in
a
workable
framework.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
i
don't
think
so,
justice,
and
the
solution
i
hasten
to
characterize
is
that
i
stumbled
upon
and
that
i
have
ultimately
reached
and
i
have
suggested
in
the
reply
brief
that
i
have
filed
with
this
court
is
that
it
is
necessary
to
avoid
these
kinds
of
jurisdiction...
these
legalistic
gymnastics,
it
is
necessary
to
go
back
to
the
beginning
and
start
rethinking
these
jurisdictional
concepts
and
rework
them,
i
think,
from
williams
versus
lee
forward.
and
the
conclusion
i
reached,
and
it
is
one
i
find
that
certainly
isn't
foreclosed
by
any
of
the
decisions
from
this
court,
but
certainly
may
have
been
assumed
to
be
foreclosed,
is
that
the
tribal
courts
do
not
have
jurisdiction
over
disputes
between
reservation
members
and
outsiders,
that
that
is
not...
it
is
a
conclusion
that
i
think
everyone
else
has
reached,
that
if
a
lawsuit
involves
a
reservation
indian
and
some
other
party
off
the
reservation,
that
state
court
jurisdiction
is
automatically
foreclosed.
and
i
look
for
the
origin
of
that
concept,
and
it
is
one
that
i
had
assumed
existed,
and
you
go
back
to
the
williams
case,
to
the
kennerly
case,
maybe
the
santa
clara
pueblo
versus
martinez
case,
and
none
of
them
say
that.
i
guess
you
have
to
keep
in
mind
the
facts
of
each
particular
case.
of
course,
the
williams
case
involved,
i
believe,
either
mr.
williams
or
mr.
lee
was
running
a
trading
post
on
the
navajo
reservation,
and
the
other
party
had
a
bill
they
didn't
pay,
and
the
proprietor
of
that
trading
post
wanted
to
collect
it,
and
he
went
to
arizona
state
court,
and
he
was
told
ultimately
no,
you
proprietor
of
a
trading
post
on
the
reservation,
you
have
to
go
to
the
tribal
court
back
in
1959.
and
from
that
principle,
which
is...
and
i
am
not
challenging
the
inherent
equity
or
rightness
of
that
principle.
that
the
man
who
was
operating
the
trading
post
on
the
reservation
has
to
go
to
tribal
court
stems
from
this
whole
indian
jurisprudence
that
any
civil
litigation
involving
a
reservation
indian
must
at
least
in
the
first
instance
go
to
tribal
court.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
i
don't
understand
your
question.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
i
think
so.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
no,
i
misunderstood
you.
no,
the
line
i
would
draw,
justice
scalia,
is
if
it
is
between
a
reservation
indian
on
a
reservation
where
public
law
280
procedures
have
not
been
followed
so
that
the
state
courts
would
have
jurisdiction
anyways,
if
we
are
dealing
with
that
situation,
such
as
on
the
blackfeet
indian
reservation
in
montana,
if
it
is
a
dispute
between
an
indian
resident
of
that
reservation
and
someone
who
resides
off
the
reservation,
outside
the
reservation,
then
no,
the
tribal
court
should
not
have
jurisdiction
over
that
matter.
if
it
is
a
matter
that,
as
williams
versus
lee,
involved
a
dispute
between
a
reservation
member
on
the
reservation
and
someone
else
who
is
residing
or
conducting
a
business
that
is
located
on
that
reservation,
fine,
and
we
haven't
gone
through
the
public
law
280
formalities
so
the
state-can
assume
jurisdiction
over
that
dispute.
that
is
where
i
would
draw
the
line.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
well,
fortunately
it
wasn't
a
diversity
case
so
i
can't
answer
that
particular--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--yes,
the
state
court
would
have
jurisdiction,
justice
white,
if--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--the
school
district
was
located
on
the
crow
reservation.
i
am
aware
of
that.
and
the
question
is,
and
the
one
that
this
court
avoided
at
that
time
deciding,
is
whether
the--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--well,
it
is
physically
located
there.
it
is
a
public
entity
in
the
state
of
montana.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
i
would
say
that
that
type
of
dispute
belongs
in
state
court
or
if
diversity
exists
it
belongs
in
federal
court,
and
i
am
hard
pressed
to
find
any
decision
from
this
court
that
says
otherwise,
that
says...
and
i
think
the
important
point
in
the
crow
tribe
case,
you
refrained
from
deciding
that
very
pointedly.
you
said
we
will
save
that
one
for
a
later
date.
but
if
you
go
to
williams,
to
kennerly,
to
any
of
these
cases,
what
this
court
has
said
is
that
for
internal
matters
affecting
the
relations
of
the
tribe
themselves,
the
tribal
courts
have
jurisdiction,
but
this
court
has
never
said
in
terms
of
the
relationships
between
tribal
members
and
persons,
firms,
or
corporations
located
off
the
reservations,
that
the
tribal
court
is
the
appropriate
forum
for
the
resolution
of
those
sorts
of
disputes.
it
has
gone
on.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
oh,
i
agree,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
i
think
the
first
critical
distinction
is
the
nature
of
the
case
that
came
before
you
in
the
crow
tribe
case.
the
national
farmers
case
was
a
direct
challenge
to
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction,
and
your
determination
as
to
whether
that
presented
a
federal
question.
here
we
are
talking
about
the
federal
court's
own
jurisdiction
over
a
controversy.
it
is
jurisdiction
very
easily
trace
its
origin
back
to
the
united
states--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--yes,
i
can.
i
can
say
exactly
that,
chief
justice,
because
of
the
nature
of
the
different
types
of
cases.
the
national
farmers
crow
tribe
case
was
an
inquiry
into
the
nature
and
extent
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction,
and
of
course
you
ultimately
said
that
was
a
federal
question
and
we
do
have
the
right
to
determine
that.
it
was
the
matter
of
how
to
go
about
doing
that
but
you
certainly
haven't
foreclosed
the
ultimate
review
by
this
tribunal,
or
go
back,
start
in
judge
batton's
court
in
billings,
and
perhaps
go
back
up
the
line
again.
you
said
that
is
a
federal
question,
but
we
want
to
wait
and
see
what
you
do
with
the
tribal
court.
i
think
that
is
greatly
different
from
the
situation
we
have
here
where
we
have
come
into
federal
court,
instituted
an
action
that
would
appear
to
me
fits
all
the
parameters
of
the
statute,
and
what
the
court
of
appeals
has
said
is,
first,
you,
comparable
to
national
farmers
union,
will
apply
the
same
procedure,
will
go
to
the
tribal
court
and
let
it
determine
whether
it...
i
think
the
language
used
by
the
court
of
appeals
is
to
see
if
the
tribe
would
manifest
any
interest
in
this
case.
and
in
effect
the
tribal
court
is
determining
the
federal
court's
jurisdiction
rather
than
the
federal
court
determining
the
tribal
court's
jurisdiction.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
i
have
no
argument
with
that
at
all,
apart
from
any
limitations
imposed
by
the
tribe
itself
on--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--yes.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
well,
yes.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
that
is
correct
judge.
i
am
not
arguing,
justice
white,
that
the
dispute
between
the
laplantes
and
the
wellmans
appears
on
its
face
to
be
one
that
is
properly
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
black
feet
tribal
court.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
i
suppose
if
they
were
going
to
relocate
from
dewitt,
iowa,
to
browning,
montana,
and
set
up
shop
there,
i
would
concede
in
those
circumstances,
yes,
but
short
of
that
state
of
affairs,
that
their
place
of
business
was
on
the
reservation,
no,
and
i
don't
think
the
necessary...
the
corollary
to
that
is,
we
start
applying
loss--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--i
would
agree
not,
that
they
should
not
be
allowed
to.
i
think
what
has
happened
up
to
now
is
that
such
jurisdiction
has
been
presumed
again
by
the
montana
supreme
court.
the
most
recent
example
we
cited
was
the
millbank
mutual
versus
eagleman
case
that
arose
on
the
fort
peck
indian
reservation,
the
federal
courts,
the
courts
of
appeal.
but
again,
it
is
one
that
i
find
lacking
in
any
substance
from
the
decisions
of
this
court
to
say
that
those
type
of
disputes
necessarily
have
to
go
to
tribal
court.
there
doesn't
seem
to
be
any
justification
for
it,
and
one
can
only
go
back
to
the
rationale
that
the
tribal
court
itself
has
espoused
in
this
case,
and
that
opinion
and
the
underlying
laplante
versus
wellman
and
iowa
mutual
lawsuit
appears
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
the
tribal
judge
there
went
on
at
some
length,
he
wrote
a
very
lengthy
opinion
explaining
why
iowa
mutual
and
midland
claims,
the
adjusting
firm,
should
not
be
dismissed
from
the
case
even
though
there
was
no
bad
faith
insurance
law
in
the
blackfeet
indian
reservation
or
any
comparable
type
of
substantive
law
that
would
apply
to
the
laplantes'
claims.
the
rationale
espoused
was
that
people
like
the
wellmans,
blackfeet
indians
who
reside
on
the
reservation,
do
purchase
insurance
and
have
an
interest
in
having
those
disputes
adjudicated.
and
therefore
there
is
an
interest
in
the
blackfeet
tribal
court
system
to
have
those
type
of
disputes
litigated
in
blackfeet
tribal
court.
that
is
an
invitation
for
general
jurisdiction
over
just
about
any
sort
of
claim.
you
could
that
if
a
blackfeet
indian
has
purchased
an
ibm
typewriter
and
thinks
he
has
been
overcharged,
the
blackfeet
tribal
court
has
an
interest
in
pursuing
antitrust
claims
against
international
business
machines
corporation.
it
becomes
kind
of
a
bootstrapping
argument,
and
that
is,
i
think,
one
of
the
major
defects
in
the
ninth
circuit's
approach
when
they
did
say,
and
i
have
found
the
quotation,
that
the
parties
are
to
find
out
whether
the
tribe
has
not
itself
manifested
an
interest
in
adjudicating
the
dispute.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
well,
it
is
a
dismissal...
i
have
to
read
it
as
comparable
to
national
farmers,
a
dismissal
without
prejudice.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
that's
correct.
i'm
sorry,
you're
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
well,
they
have,
but
you
go
back
to
the
r.j.
williams
case
and
i
guess
there
is
that
ultimate
question,
to
see...
if,
as
i
understand
their
rationale,
if
we
ultimately
determined
that
the
blackfeet
tribal
court
doesn't
have
jurisdiction
over
this
type
of
controversy,
ipso
facto
the
state
court
would
be
vested
with
jurisdiction
perhaps
and
therefore
the
diversity
jurisdiction
would
exist
because
we
then
get
over
the
woods
versus
interstate
realty
hurdle.
as
i
have
suggested,
i
think
the
more
logical
way
over
the
woods
versus
interstate
realty
hurdle,
and
i
think
this
case
does
boil
down
as
the
government
in
its
amicus
brief
suggested,
it
boils
down
to
an
erie
railroad-tompkins
problem
of
reconciling
this,
is
to
redefine
or
i
should
say
more
precisely
define
the
limits
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction,
and
if
one
does
define
those
limits
in
the
manner
i
have
suggested,
that
internal
tribal
disputes,
matters
arising
on
the
reservation
between
persons
residing
there
go
to
tribal
court,
and
matters
between
tribal
members
on
the
reservation
and
those
persons,
firms;
or
corporations
located
off
the
reservation
don't
belong
in
tribal
court
but
rather
in
state
or
federal
court,
depending
upon
the
existence
of
diversity
or
such
other
matters
such
as
a
federal
question
that
would
grant
jurisdiction,
then
the
erie
railroad
versus
tompkins
problem
and
the
woods
versus
interstate
reality
doorclosing
type
problem
evaporates.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
yes.
that
is
the
way
i
originally
approached
the
case,
justice
scalia.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
first
of
all
because
they
aren't
state
courts.
and
i
think
we
do
an
injustice
to
the
litigants
when
we
treat
them
as
the
equal
of
state
courts.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
we
have
a
different...
we
have
the
underlying
tort
claims
proceeding
in
tribal
courts.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
to
that
extent
it
is
no
different
from
any
other,
a
typical
declaratory
judgment
action
for
which,
of
course,
there
is
an
express
grant
of
federal
jurisdiction.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
well,
i
hope
so.
i
have
done
it
a
number
of
times
myself,
justice.
yes,
if
there
is
an
underlying
tort
claim
in
state
district
court,
it
is
something
that
is
frequently
done,
at
least
out
in
the
district
of
montana,
if
there
is
a
legitimate
coverage
questions,
to
institute
a
separate
action
either
in
state
or
federal
court
to
determine
those
coverage
questions,
and
i
think
it
is
a
type
of
procedure
that
is
frequently
employed
throughout
the
country,
so
i
don't
have
any
problem
with
that.
i
think
you
do
ultimately,
if
you
are
not
going
to
buy
my
argument
to
redraw
or
more
precisely
to
find
the
jurisdictional
arguments,
we
do
get
back
to
that
erie
railroad
versus
tompkins
problem
as
alluded
to,
that
if
it
is
a
nondiverse
party
they
be
precluded
from
going
into
state
court
perhaps,
and
that
action
would
have
to
proceed
in
tribal
court,
and
gosh,
the
tribal
court
is
going
to
be
applying
tribal
customs
and
practices,
or
it
has
the
right
to,
whereas
in
federal
court,
the
federal
court,
at
least,
if
we
go
by
the
rules
of
decision
act
and
erie
railroad
versus
tompkins,
that
federal
court
will
be
applying
state
law,
or
should
be,
and
so
we
have
the
prospect
of
different
rules
being
applied
to
adjudicate
basically
the
same
controversy.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
i
don't
think
there
is
any
practical
dispute
that
it
is
montana
law.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
well,
again,
that
is
an
interesting
matter,
but
again
it
is
montana
law.
i
am
amused
and
i
will
point
you
to
this,
and
maybe
mr.
bottomly
since
he
is
here
can
answer
this,
but
if
you
go
back
and
read
the
amended
complaint
that
is
in...
i
think
it
is
at
page
29
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
amended
complaint
filed
by
the
laplantes
in
blackfeet
tribal
court
in
that
they
hold
the
wellmans
to
be
liable
for
mr.
laplante's
injuries
because
of
the
wellmans'
failure
to
comply
with
montana's
workers'
compensation
law
and
failing
to
have
workers'
compensation
coverage
for
him
and
therefore...
and
they
cite
in
the
complaint,
the
amended
complaint
section
3971.509
of
montana's
workers
compensation
law
and
say
that
because
of
that
it
is
kind
of
a
strict
liability
situation.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
i
suppose
it
could,
but
again,
they
are
just
adopting
montana
law.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
we
don't
know
at
all
what
the
tribal
court
is
going
to
do.
that
is
one
of
the
great
uncertainties
that
litigants
have,
and
that,
i
guess,
leads
me
to
what
i
think
is
the
ultimate
point
and
why
i
believe
it
is
important
for
this
court
to
redefine
or
more
precisely
define
the
jurisdictional
boundaries,
because
i
think
ultimately
it
defeats
the
interests
of
both--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--are
you
asking
what
type
of
litigant?
no,
i
don't
think
the
state
courts
of
montana
or
the
federal
court
in
the
district
of
montana
from
that
point
of
view
has
ever
been
closed
to
indian
litigants
who
want
to
institute
litigation
there.
i
read,
you
know,
you
go
back
to
whatever
analysis
you
want
to--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--if
we
have
a
williams
type
lee
dispute,
yes,
i
would
say
that
the
tribal
court
jurisdiction,
the
matters
that
belong
in
tribal
court--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--yes.
okay,
and
matters
that--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--no,
no,
i
am--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--well
that
was
the
store
owner.
that
was
the
store
owner.
but
let's
switch
things
around.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
the
indian--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--yes,
and
i
think
that
exists
now,
and
i
apologize
for
the
confusion.
i
was
trying
to
make
that
point
with
justice
stevens,
that
the
the
indian
litigants,
reservation
members
in
montana,
any
of
the
indian
reservations,
i
believe,
have
the
right
and
have
practiced
it,
and
in
my
experience
come
into
state
district
court,
into
federal
district
court
and
pursue
their
rights,
it
is
a
one-way
street.
we
can't
turn
around
or
my
clients
as
nonreservation
members
cannot
go
into
state
or
federal
court
and
as
matters
now
sit
pursue
those
claims.
so
that
is
how...
i
guess
it
is
a
one-way
type
operation,
but
the
point
that
i
want
to
leave
you
with
is,
i
think
it
is
ultimately
to
all
the
litigants'
best
interests
that
you
redefine
this
jurisdiction,
because
i
think
that
both
the
indians
and
the
non-indian
parties,
citizens
are
ill-served
by
the
present
state
of
affairs,
and
it
is
one
i
can
relate
to
in
my
own
personal
experience,
because
it
happens
to
me
and
it
happens
to
me
on
a
frequent
basis,
that
people
come
in
and
they
want
to
talk
to
me
about
a
prospective
commercial
or
business
dealing
on
the
indian
reservations
in
montana.
my
experience
in
dealing
with
indians
is
not
limited
to
this
case.
and
my
advice
to
them
is
comparable
to
the
advice
that
many
of
my
colleagues
in
montana
give
to
such
persons.
don't,
because
we
can't
help
you,
because
we
don't
know
what
the
rules
are
and
the
risks
involved
are
too
great.
you
are
going
to
be
in
tribal
court
if
a
dispute
arises,
and
i
can't
advise
you
as
to
what
your
ultimate
rights
or
remedies
are,
and
the
net
effect
is
that
all
too
often
those
types
of
commercial
and
social
interactions
are
discouraged
because
of
the
uncertainty
over
the
present
state
of
affairs,
and
if
we
take
this
court's
admonitions
or
advice
at
face
value
in
both
williams
and
in
the
wold
case,
one
of
the
rules
of
federal
indian
policy
is
to
further
the
assimilation
of
reservation
indians
into
the
mainstream
of
american
life.
the
extension
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction
i
think
almost
by
default
ill
serves
that
goal,
and
i
think
if
commercial
and
social
interaction
is
to
be
encouraged
it
will
be
much
more
encouraged
if
the
jurisdictional
lines
are
drawn
as
i
have
suggested
this
morning.
i
will
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
yes,
chief
justice.
thank
you.
replying
directly
to
the
question
posed
by
justice
white,
iowa
mutual
did
contest
the
jurisdiction,
contested
the
jurisdiction
over
the
person,
over
the
res,
and
contested
jurisdiction
based
on
insufficiency
of
service
of
process
in
the
tribal
court
proceedings.
interestingly,
and
i
think
it
bears
on
this--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--yes.
they
were
denied,
except
for
the
motion
for
insufficiency
of
service
of
process,
they
were
directed
to
replead
and
reserve.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
the
tribal
judge
has
said
so.
it
has
not
gone
up
to
this
appellate
court,
that
issue,
so
we
are
in
this
crow
tribe
type
of
framework.
we
haven't
exhausted
our
tribal
court
remedies
to
contest,
as
was
done
in
the
national
farmers
case.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
in
montana
state
court.
what
happened
was--
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
--well,
it
can
go
forward,
but
it
has
to
await
the
resolution
of
the
underlying
tort
claim.
in
1982
the
montana
supreme
court
decided
a
case
called
clout
versus
flink.
mr.
maxon
r.
davis
all
right.
there
is
only
one
action
in
tribal
court.
there
are
different
aspects
and
different
defendants,
but
there
is
only
that
one
case
there.
that
should
be
clarified.
iowa
mutual,
midland
claims,
and
the
wellmans
are
all
defendants
in
one
proceeding
in
tribal
court.
as
of
yet
it
has
not
been
bifurcated.
i
could
spend
all
afternoon
talking
about
that
kind
of
lawsuit
but
it
is
not
before
this
court.
about
mr.
bottomly's
suggestion
that
congress
does
not
want
actions
like
this
one
brought
in
state
court,
i
disagree
wholeheartedly
with
that
because
i
think
public
law
280
exists
and
this
court
has
recognized
public
law
280
as
a
procedure,
as
an
expression
of
congress's
desire
that
such
actions
be
assumed
by
state
courts.
in
kennerly
this
court
admonished
the
states
that
the
formalities
of
public
law
280
have
to
be
adhered
to.
however,
it
didn't
abrogate
public
law
280.
that
exists
as
an
expression
that
the
states
should
ultimately
assume
jurisdiction
over
all
matter
of
actions
that
otherwise
would
be
within
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
courts,
and
to
respond
particularly
to
justice
scalia's
comment,
public
law
280
does
not
define
the
nature
or
extent
of
that
tribal
court
jurisdiction.
it
merely
says
for
those
types
of
actions
the
states
can
do
this
to
assume
it,
but
it
hasn't
said
that
williams
versus
lee
is
an
appropriate
expression
of
tribal
court
jurisdiction
or
what
the
ninth
circuit
views
it
to
be
in
this
case
or
anyone
else's.
my
understanding
of
what
public
law
280,
it
can
easily
be
reconciled
to
the
proposition
which
i
have
advanced
this
morning
that
for
those
limited
matters
the
procedure
exists
for
the
states
to
assume
jurisdiction
over
them,
but
ipso
facto
it
does
not
mean
that
all
these
other
matters
that
in
this
gray
area
where
tribal
courts
have
assumed
jurisdiction
by
default
that
those
can
do
so.
