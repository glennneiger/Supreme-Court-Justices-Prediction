chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
85-1598,
iowa
mutual
insurance
company
versus
edward
m.
laplante.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
davis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
sounds
like
bad
news.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--it
is
hard,
isn't
it,
to
distinguish
some
of
what
we
said
in
the
farmer's
union
case
two
terms
ago
from
something
very
much
like
that.
there
didn't
we
say
that
the
tribal
court
should
be
the
first
to
pass
on
its
own
jurisdiction?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
certainly
federal
question
jurisdiction,
although
perhaps...
it
must
be
based
in
the
constitution
in
some
way,
though
not
granted
until
much
later
than
diversity
jurisdiction
to
the
lower
federal
courts,
but
if
federal
question
jurisdiction
such
as
the
jurisdiction
of
the
tribal
court,
if
that
sort
of
a
case
filed
in
the
district
court
must
be
first
referred
to
the
tribal
court
can't
you
say
that
a
diversity
case
should
be
no
different?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
davis.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
bottomly.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
montana
law,
mr.
bottomly,
can
a
plaintiff
sue
a
defendant
and
the
sue
a
defendant
for
personal
injury
and
at
the
same
time
before
that
suit
is
terminated
sue
the
insurance
company
for
bad
faith
refusal
to
settle?
the
first
action
doesn't
have
to
be
determined
before
you
can
sue
the
insurance
company?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
blackfoot
tribal
court
given
any
indication,
does
it
follow
montana
law
on
these
sorts
of
issues?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
then
if
the
federal
district
court
on
that
sort
of
national
farmers
union
review
were
to
decide
that
the
tribal
court
didn't
have
jurisdiction,
all
of
a
sudden
you
have
kind
of
a
springing
use.
it
turns
out
that
he
district
court
did
have
diversity
jurisdiction.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
kind
of
weird.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
kind
of
like
a
long
arm
statute
that
the
federal
constitution
says
you
can
go
so
far
and
the
federal
court
can
say
that
with
respect
to
the
indian
tribe,
but
an
indian
tribe
might
say,
well,
we
don't
think
our
own
statute
authorizes
us
to
go
as
far
as
the
federal
constitution
would
allow
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
of
course
that
was
tribal
sovereignty
as
opposed
to
a
state,
i
think.
you
are
in
little
bit
different
ball
park
when
you
are
talking
about
tribal
sovereignty
versus
a
federal
court
that
has
also
received
a
grant
of
jurisdiction
from
congress.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bottomly.
mr.
davis,
would
you
like
to
say
something
more?
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
davis.
the
case
is
submitted.
we'll
resume
there
at
one
o'clock.
