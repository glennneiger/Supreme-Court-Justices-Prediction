justice
antonin
scalia
now,
he
could
have
done
that
whether
or
not
he
was
later
appointed
by
the
court,
right?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
can
have
a
freelance
private
stinger
if
he
wants
to
go
out
and
set
it
up.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right,
except
for
the...
well,
but
all
of
this
was
done
before
any
appointment
by
the
court;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
you've
just
referred
to,
the
beginning
of
the
sting
operation.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
of
that
could
have
been
done
whether...
whether
or
not
he
was
later
appointed
by
the
court,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay.
and
he
could
have
taken
all
that
information
and
brought
it
to
the
court--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
brought
it
to
the
u.s.
attorney?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
doesn't
matter,
as
far
as
the
sting
is
concerned.
you've
acknowledge
he
could
have
done
it
privately
and
then
handed
over
the
results
of
it
to
the
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
doesn't
matter
during
the
sting
stage
whether
he's
acting
in
his
own
interest
or
in
the
government's
interest
or
in
his
client's
interest.
it
doesn't
matter,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
some
reason
why
misrepresentation
and
deceit
by
a
lawyer
is
okay
so
long
as
he's
a
united
states
attorney?
how
does
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--is
that
in
the
canons
of
ethics?
i
mean,
is
there
a
distinction
in
the
canons
on
that?
i
mean--
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
had
only
one
client
during
the
sting
here.
he
wasn't
representing
the
united
states
yet.
justice
antonin
scalia
prior
to
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
had
just
one
client?
you
say
the
sting
began
before
he
became
a
special
prosecutor?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
it's
not
sure
to
be
there
next
year.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
the
extent
that
the
court
has
to
rely
on
that
fund
to
any
attorney
that
it
appoints,
the
court's
in
not
much
better
shape
than
it
is
in
having
to
rely
on
the
united
states
attorney?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
at
the
mercy
of
another
branch,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
could
i
ask
about
number
two?
where
does
the
court
get
authority
to
appoint
a
special
prosecutor?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
doesn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--go
ahead.
doesn't
that
contravene
the
constitution,
which
requires
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--isn't
this
person
an
officer?
an
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
a
regular
prosecutor
not
an
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
united
states
attorney
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--he
is
an
officer?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
this
individual
who
does
the
same
thing
is
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
glad
you
haven't
made
the
argument
that
your
brief
made.
i
have
real
troubles
if
he
is
an
officer,
because
you
handled
that...
the
government
handled
that
quite
readily
in
the
brief
by
simply
saying
that
the
constitution
authorizes
the
appointment
of
officers
by
the
courts.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
rule
43(b)
i
don't
think
helps
you,
because
rules
43(b)
was
never
passed
by
the
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
constitution
requires
that
the
congress
may
by
law
vest
appointment
in
the
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
rules
43(b)
has
never
been
enacted
by
the
congress.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
argument's
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
argument's
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bryson,
what's
the
oldest
case
you
have
that
gives
the
courts
authorities
to
cite
for
criminal
contempt
without
a
statute
and
on...
with
their
own
appointment
of
a
prosecutor
for
violation
of
one
of
their
orders,
as
opposed
to
for,
you
know,
contempt
that
occurs
in
front
of
them,
an
insult
to
their
dignity,
an
obstruction
of
their
processes,
but
just
disobeying
one
of
their
judgments?
what's
the
oldest
case
you
have
that
allows
the
court
some
inherent
power
to
punish
for
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
congress
enforce
its
orders?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
long
have
we
consistently
held
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
older
than
the
thirties?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bainton--
justice
antonin
scalia
--let's
take
a
very
important
and
massive
court
decree,
like
the
old
at&t
decree,
which
was
essentially
the
structure
for
our
telecommunications
industry
for
decades.
do
you
think
the
court
could
have
just
been,
in
effect,
legislature,
judge
and
jury
by
enforcing
that
decree
through
appointing
its
own
prosecutors
to
investigate
whether
at&t
was
abiding
by
all
the
constraints?
doesn't
that
trouble
you
as
far
as
separation
of
powers
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
that's
right.
it
could
have
been
brought
by
a
private
party,
and
you
could
have
had
a
massive
decree
like
that.
isn't
there
some
problem
about...
i
mean,
it's
fine
to
have
judicial
independence.
but
i
thought
that
there
were
checks
and
balances,
and
that
all
of
the
branches
sort
of
depend
on
one
another
to
a
degree.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
we
have
the
right
to
make
the
judgment
and
to
enforce
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
bainton.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
like
the
notion
that
we
have
the
power
not
just
to
render
judgments
but
to
enforce
them
as
well.
what
happens
when,
after
your
appointment,
you
come
in
try
the
case,
and
we
say,
six
years?
all
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
judges.
justice
antonin
scalia
a
federal
court.
it
gives
the...
on
the
contempt
citation,
it
gives
the
defendant
six
years,
or
whatever.
and
nobody
arrests
him.
the
u.s.
attorney
just
says,
you
know,
it's
too
much.
or
i'm
too
busy.
my
people
are
out
doing
other
things.
nothing
happens.
now,
do
we
have
authority
to
appoint
somebody
to
arrest
and
incarcerate
him
as
well?
i
mean,
wouldn't
that
follow
from
your
notion
that
somehow
we
have
to
be
self-contained;
otherwise
we're
not
real
judges?
aren't
we
ultimately
dependent
on
the
executive
anyway?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
notion
that
somehow
the
effectiveness
of
the
courts,
the
notion
that
somehow
it's
dependent
upon
the
other
branches
is
not
inconceivable,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
that's
because--
justice
antonin
scalia
--maybe
that's
because
the
united
states
attorney
thinks
that
of
all
the
violations
of
law
out
there,
the
flouting
of
this
particular
court
order
is
not
the
most
serious
that
should
engage
the
time
of
either
his
people
or
the
courts.
now,
why
do
our
matters
have
to
go
to
the
top
of
the
prosecutorial
agenda
necessarily?
what
isn't
that
violation
of
law
one
that
ought
to
be
put
on
the
list
for
the
united
states
attorney
like
all
the
other
ones?
it's
a
violation
of
law.
