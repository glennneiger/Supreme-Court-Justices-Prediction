we
will
hear
argument
now
in
no.
85-1329,
young
versus
united
states,
consolidated
with
85-6207,
klayminc
against
the
united
states,
et
cetera.
mr.
cohen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
can
see
that's
a
factual
difference.
why
does
it
make
any
legal
difference?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--i
think,
as
a
matter
of
original
inquiry,
that
perhaps
the
standards
would
be
higher
for
a
public
prosecutor
than
for
a
private
attorney?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
cohen,
let
me
read
you,
if
i
may,
a
sentence
from
the
second
circuit
opinion,
and
ask
you
if
that
describes...
judge
lombard's
opinion
says:
the
fact
that
sol
klayminc
had
brought
suit
against
bainton
and
the
new
york
courts
alleging
harassment
and
other
acts
is
entitled
to
no
weight
as
the
suit
was
clearly
frivolous.
it
was
never
pressed,
and
was
finally
dismissed
by
consent.
is
that
the
suit
you're
referring
to?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
appoint
a
private
attorney
who's
not
representing
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
how
does
the
attorney
get
paid?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
a
matter
of
course?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice

h.
rehnquist
xxx
addressed
to
this
situation,
mr.
bryson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he's
in
the
aba,
or
the
aba
has
an
interest
in
the
outcome;
that's
what
that
sounds
like.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
bryson,
what
you
say
i
don't
doubt
makes
a
good
deal
of
sense
in
the
abstract.
but
if
we
adopt
your
position
that
people
with
a
conflict
of
interest
can't
be
appointed
special
prosecutors,
that
it
first
have
to
go
to
the
united
states
attorney,
the
court
is
left
without
any
realistic
way
of
enforcing
an
injunction
or
prosecuting
a
contemner,
unless
the
u.s.
attorney
approves.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
bainton,
we'll
hear
from
you
now.
chief
justice

was
the
way
crimes
were
prosecuted
at
the
time
of
the
constitution.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
weren't
a
lot
of
u.s.
attorneys
around.
the
typical
prosecution
was
by
the
victim's
attorney.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bainton.
mr.
cohen,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
