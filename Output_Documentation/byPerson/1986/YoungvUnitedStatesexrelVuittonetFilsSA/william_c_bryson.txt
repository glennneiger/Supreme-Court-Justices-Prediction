mr.
william
c.
bryson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
am
representing
one
of
the
two
parties
which
is
calling
itself
the
government
in
this
case.
for
clarification,
of
course,
mr.
bainton
is
the
special
prosecutor.
i'll
refer
to
him
as
the
special
prosecutor,
and
i'll
refer
to
the
positions
that
the
department
of
justice
is
arguing
before
the
court
as
the
government's
position.
now,
the
government's
position
in
this
case
is
a
little
different
from
the
position
taken
by
either
of
the
other
two
parties.
basically,
it
can
be
summarized
in
four
propositions.
first,
that
ordinarily
it
is
the
united
states
attorney
who
should
prosecute
serious
contempts.
second,
that
in
some
special
cases...
and
we
think
that
for
practical
reasons,
this
is
going
to
be
a
very
limited
class...
but
in
some
special
cases,
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
appoint
a
private
attorney
to
prosecute
a
criminal
contempt.
third,
that
that
should
be
done,
if
at
all,
only
after
the
united
states
attorney
has
been
given
the
case
for
consideration
and
has
declined
the
prosecution.
and
fourth...
excuse
me...
that
the
attorney
for
the
opposing
party
in
a
civil
case
should
never
be
the
party
who
is
appointed
to
prosecute
a
criminal...
a
serious
criminal
contempt.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that,
your
honor.
first,
rule
42(b)
does
contain
a
reference...
it's
a
very
cryptic
reference,
to
be
sure.
but
it
is
a
reference
to
the
notion
that
either
the
u.s.
attorney
or
an
attorney
appointed
by
the
court
can
handle
criminal
contempts.
it
does
not
specify
what
that
attorney
is
to
do,
other
than
to
take
part
in
the
notice-taking
process.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
but
in
any
event,
contemplates
the
participation
of
a
private
attorney
in
some
respect.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
our
second
answer...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
don't
think
so,
because
my
second
answer
is
that
i
think
criminal
contempt
is
a
different
animal
in
some
important
respects
from
the
typical
criminal
offense.
and
we
believe
that
it
is
inherent,
even
if
there
were
no
rule
42(b),
it
is
inherent
in
the
power
of
the
courts
to
enforce
their
judgments
that
they
are
not
wholly
dependent
on
the
executive
branch
to
enforce
those
judgments.
they
have--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--we
don't
believe
he
is
an
officer.
we
believe
he
would
fall
in
the
buckley
v.
valeo
sense,
more
in
the
category
of
an
employee.
but
even...
excuse
me...
if
he
were--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
we
believe
he
is
not
an
officer
but
an
employee.
that
is
to
say,
his
task,
his
responsibilities
here,
are
not
so
broad.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i'm
sorry.
and
united
states
attorney,
yes.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
right.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
he
does,
your
honor,
i
think
do
the
same
thing,
because
he
is
limited
in
several
very
important
respects.
first
of
all,
he
doesn't
have
the
breadth
of
responsibility
for
deciding
who
is
to
be
prosecuted.
he
has
been
given
an
assignment
to
pursue
a
particular
case.
in
this
sense,
he's
more
like
an
assistant
united
states
attorney.
and
second,
he
is
only
given
one
case.
he
is
not
given
the
task
of
deciding
throughout
the
world
of
potential
criminal
offenses,
which
ones
to
pursue.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
that,
i
think,
your
honor,
would
only
be
so
if
we
accept
that
rule
42(b)
is
a
legislative
delegation
to
the
courts
of
the
authority
to--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
that's
right.
and
that's
one
of
the--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--that's
correct,
and
that's
one
of
the
problems.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
that's
correct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
pardon?
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the...
there
is
some
force
to
the
argument.
and
i
think...
i
recognize
your
point.
i
think
there
is
some
force
to
the
argument
that
the
appointments
clause
does
not
get
in
the
way
of...
show
a
constitutional
disposition
against...
this
kind
of
appointment.
because
if
congress
had,
for
example,
more
specifically
designated
the
special
prosecutor
as
being
someone
who
could
be
appointed,
then
we
would
be
beyond
appointments
clause
problem.
so...
excuse
me...
it's
not
a
constitutional
problem.
at
most,
it's
a
question
of
the
degree
of
the
specificity
of
the
authorizing
statute.
but
beyond
that,
i
think
it's
important
to
point
out
some
of
the
practical
problems
that
this
kind
of
conflict
of
interest
creates.
we
point
out
in
the
brief
that
the
statutes
and
regulations
which
congress
has
imposed
on
regular
department
of
justice
employees
establish
a
federal
policy
against
just
this
kind
of
conflict
of
interest.
we
think
it's
a
general
policy.
we
think
it's
a
policy
that
this
court
ought
to
apply
to
this
kind
of
conflicting
representation
where
the
united
states
and
a
private
party
are
both
being
represented
by
the
same
attorney.
section
208(a)
was
pointed
out.
section
528
of
title
xxviii
states
that
conflicts
of
interest
will
not
be
permitted
in
cases
in
which
the
united
states...
an
assistant
united
states
attorney
is
carrying
forward
a
prosecution.
and
that
statute
directs
the
government
to
pass
particular
regulations
dealing
with
conflicts
of
interest.
and
among
those
regulations
is
one
that
would
apply
directly
in
this
case,
section
735-4,
stating
that
if
an
organization
has
a
substantial
interest
in
the
outcome
of
a
case,
and
that
organization
is
one
with
which
the
attorney
is
allied
in
the
personal...
in
some
personal
sense,
that
the
attorney
is
disqualified
from
proceeding
with
the
prosecution
or
investigation.
now,
the
practical
problems
here
are
very
real.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
i
think
it
would
be
addressed,
your
honor,
to
a
situation
where,
for
example--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
it
would
clearly
apply,
your
honor,
to
a
case
where,
for
example,
if
i
continued
to
represent
a
private
party,
and
that
private
party
had
an
interest
in
the
outcome
of
a
lawsuit
in
which
i
was
the
prosecutor,
that
would
clearly
be
covered.
now,
there
might
be
closer
questions
dealing
with
organizations
such
as
the
aba,
but
clearly,
in
a
case
like
this,
that
regulation
would
cover
a
prosecutor,
and
the
prosecutor
would
be
disqualified
from
proceeding
with
the
investigation
or
prosecution.
now,
as
a
practical
matter,
there
are
special
problems
in
this
kind
of
case,
one
of
which
is,
for
example,
mention
was
made
of
mr.
young.
mr.
young
is
one
of
the
defendants
who
apparently
had
some
assets,
and
he
had
a
$750,000
judgment
which
was
subject
to
execution
if
he
were
convicted.
well,
that
is
an
enormous
incentive
to
choose
mr.
young
as
one
of
the
defendants
to
prosecute,
as
opposed
to,
for
example,
using
mr.
young
as
a
witness
against
some
of
the
other
defendants.
similarly,
in
current
times,
when
there
is
a
specific
federal
statute
prohibiting
trademark
infringement,
the
section
402
of
the
contempt
statutes
comes
into
play,
and
that
statute
provides
that
a
fine
can
either
go
to
the...
the
victim
or
to
the
united
states.
obviously,
the
attorney
for
the
victim
is
going
to
have
an
interest
to
see
to
it,
to
urge
the
court,
to
have
the
fine
paid
to
the
victim
as
opposed
to
the
united
states.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
well,
your
honor,
i
have
a
couple
of
answers.
first
of
all,
i
think
almost
invariably
the
united
states
attorney
will
prosecute
such
cases.
that's
the
policy
of
the
justice
department
as
set
out
in
the
section
of
the
u.s.
attorney's
manual
that
we
have...
we
have
quoted
in
the
brief.
second,
there
is
a
fallback
in
the
availability
of
administrative
office
funds.
and
third...
and
i
think
this
is
not
an
insignificant
factor...
there
are
law
firms
that
are
willing
to
offer
services
on
a
pro
bono
basis,
which
happens
on
a
regular...
regular...
from
time
to
time,
in
cases
in
which,
for
example,
a
mandamus
action
is
brought
against
a
judge,
and
none
of
the
parties
is
prepared
to
defend
the
judge.
the
judge
can
be
defended
on
a
pro
bono
basis
by
a
law
firm
that
the
judge
selects.
so--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
the
mccann
case
would
fall
into
that
category.
most
of
the
cases...
the
problem
is,
most
of
these
cases
have
involved
very
small
contempts.
and
the
degree
to
which
somebody
is
participating
as
a
special
prosecutor
is
on
a
very
limited
basis.
in
mccann,
it
may
not
have
gone
much
beyond
simply
the
notice
stage,
which
was
authorized...
was
subsequently
authorized
by
rule
42(b).
but
certainly
mccann
and
some
of
the
other
cases
of
about
that
age
that
are
cited
in
mr.
bainton's
brief
would
fall
generally
into
that
category.
and
that's
from
the
middle
thirties.
thank
you.
