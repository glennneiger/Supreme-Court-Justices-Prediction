mr.
james
a.
cohen
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
person
charged
with
a
serious
criminal
contempt
has
a
right
to
be
investigated
and
prosecuted
by
a
disinterested
prosecutor;
more
specifically,
a
prosecutor
who
is
not
concurrently
representing
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
the
interests
of
a
private
party.
in
1978
vuitton
sued
the
claimants,
who
are
among
the
petitioners
here,
for
trademark
infringement.
in
july
of
1970...
excuse
me,
in
july
of
1982,
that
matter
was
settled
with
a
promise
on
the
part
of
the
defendants
in
the
action
to
pay
$100,000,
and
the
issuance
of
an
injunction
which
was
designed
to
protect
vuitton's
trademark
rights.
that
injunction
prohibited,
among
other
things,
the
manufacture
or
sale,
offering
to
sell,
and
aiding
and
abetting
such
an
offer.
the
issue...
the
injunction
was
issued
in
july
of
1982.
and
in
december
of
1982,
sol
klayminc
sued
mr.
bainton,
joseph
bainton,
who
was
the
lawyer
for
vuitton
in
the
underlying
trademark
infringement
injunction,
for
defamation.
the
source
of
the
alleged
defamation
was
an
article
which
was
published
in
the
wall
street
journal
in
december
of
1982,
and
at
the
same
time
that
the
suit
began,
or
approximately
the
same
time,
payment
on
the
$100,000
settlement
was
stopped.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
the
defamation
action
was
discontinued
subsequent
to
the
convictions
in
this
case.
in
february
of
1983,
the
sting
in
this
matter
began.
the
sting
covered
a
wide
number
of
topics,
and
by
the
end
of
march,
mr.
bainton
felt,
apparently,
that
he
had
sufficient
information
to
apply
to
the
court
to
be
appointed
as
special
prosecutor
pursuant
to
rule
42(b),
as
well
as
applied
to
the
court
for
some
extraordinary
authority
to
conduct
the
sting.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
i
think
the
answer--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--well,
except
that
it
was
apparently
mr.
bainton's
intention
to
supervise
that.
and
ethical
prohibitions
would
prohibit
him
from
taping
meetings
without
the
consent
of
all
the
parties.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
all
of
which
was
done?
mr.
james
a.
cohen
yes,
the
sting
had
begun,
and
there
was
no
taping
prior
to
the
application--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--to
be
appointed
as
special
prosecutor.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
without
taping,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
yes.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
that's
correct,
he
could
have.
absolutely.
however,
no
effort
was
made
to
take
this
matter
to
the
united
states
attorney
when
the
information
first
came
into
the
special
prosecutor's,
or
bainton's...
mr.
bainton's
possession
at
that
time.
the
only
time
that
any
contact
was--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--there
were
videotapes
and
audio
tapes.
none...
as
far
as
we
know,
i
have
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
taping
occurred
prior
to
the
time
that
mr.
bainton
was
appointed.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
not
in
new
york,
where
most
of
them
took
place.
they
would
have
violated
california
law.
and
the
only
way
that
it
was
permitted
in
california
was
by
virtue
of
mr.
bainton's
status
as
a
special
prosecutor.
indeed,
he
contacted
a
member
of
the
los
angeles
county
district
attorney's
office
in
effect
to
notify
them
and
to
receive,
i
suppose,
advance...
advance
approval.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
because...
i
don't...
i
don't
know
that
it...
i
think
that
the
answer
is
that
the
california
authorities
treated
mr.
bainton
as
an
assistant
united
states
attorney.
the
state
law
of
california
prohibiting
taping
things
would
not
apply
to
a
federal
prosecutor.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
i
think
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
united
states
attorneys
in
california
are
permitted
to
do--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
no,
it's
surveillance-type
taping.
in
a
hotel
room,
they
were
done.
and
audio
taping
on
telephones.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
that's
among
the
ethical
concerns,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
that
happened
in
this
case
too.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
for
a
lawyer
who's
representing
the
two
clients,
yes.
for
a
lawyer
who
simultaneously
represents,
or
purports
to
represent
the...
represent
the
interests
of
the
united
states
and
at
the
same
time
represents
a
private
party;
i
think
that's
improper.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
no,
i
don't
have
a
serious
problem
with
that
if--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--if
it's
done
under
proper
circumstances.
we
discuss
stings--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--well,
i
think
that
it
has
to
do
this
with
it.
in
a
sting,
the
government,
in
effect,
participates
in
the
crime
itself.
and
it's
been--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--pardon
me?
mr.
james
a.
cohen
no,
i
understand
that,
justice
rehnquist.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
this
court
should...
should
in
anyway
eliminate
it
from
the
repertoire
of
tools
that
law
enforcement
personnel
use.
it
is
a
much
different
thing,
though,
when
it's
used
by
a
private
attorney
who's
simply
been
given
a
label,
who
has
no
training
and
no
accountability
to
anyone.
so
i
think
that's
the
difference.
and
i
think
that
there
are
also
intrinsic
problems
within
it.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
why
does
the
fact
that
a
private
attorney
did
it--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--who
had
the
conflicting
obligations?
because
you
can't
tell
how
those
conflicting
interests
influence
the
investigation
and
prosecution.
there's
no
way
that
we
can
sort
through
this
record
and
say,
well,
at
this
point
in
time,
mr.
bainton
was
acting
properly
in
the
interests
of
the
united
states.
and
at
this
point
in
time,
it
seemed
that
he
was
really
acting
for
vuitton.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
the
difference--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--well,
it
does
matter
if
you're
permitting
this
person
to
do
things
that
he
wouldn't
otherwise
be
able
to
do.
and
that's
exactly
what
happened
here.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
he
wouldn't
have
been
able
to
tape,
for
example.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
because
of
the
ethical
prohibitions
which
exist
in
our
profession.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
i'm
sorry,
justice
stevens.
i
thought
you
were
positing
an
example
where
someone
goes
out
and
pretends
to
be
someone
else.
that's
not
the
taping.
there
are
ethical
prohibitions
against
misrepresentation
and
deceit.
that
would
arguably
cover
that
kind
of
conduct.
but
commonly,
these
things
are
done
not
by
the
lawyers
but
by
the
investigative
agencies.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
you
have
a
little
more
than
that
here,
your
honor.
you
have
mr.
bainton
and
his
associate,
mr.
devlin,
playing
a
very
active
role
at
every
point
in
the
proceedings
here.
this
isn't
simply,
give
us
a
monthly
report
and
a
monthly
bill.
this
is
an
active
role
in
every
single
step
of
these
proceedings.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
yes,
there
is,
i
think.
the
answer
to
that
question
is
that
when
it's...
i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
there's
not
a
distinction
in
the
canons.
but
when
it's
done
by
the
government,
we
believe,
at
least,
that
the
government
is
doing
it
for
one
reason
and
one
reason
only,
in
the
interest
of
the
public
to
ferret
out
crime.
when
it's
done
by
someone
who
has
two
interests,
we
can't
be
sure
why
it's
being
done.
we
can't
be
sure,
in
effect,
how
it's
being
done.
the
decisions
of
this
court
and
other
courts
which
permit
stings
and
other
investigative
techniques,
which
have
at
times
been
said
to
create
problems
or
concerns
about
defendants'
rights,
and
the
integrity
of
the
system,
have
all
been
involved
with
a
public
prosecutor,
who
was
trained,
who
was
accountable,
to
higher
ups
in
the
u.s.
attorney's
office
and
in
the
justice
department.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
you
might.
except
that
we
are
not
concerned,
i
think,
rightfully,
that
as
a
general
matter
public
prosecutors
will
misuse
their
office
in
defense
of
some
other
client;
because
there
is
no
other
client.
in
this
case,
when
you
have
the
attorney
purporting
to
represent
the
interests
of
the
united
states,
and
at
the
same
time,
representing
that
second
client
who
has
a
very
serious
interest
in
the
united
states'
case,
we
just
can't
tell.
we
can't
be
confident.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
no,
that's
not
true,
your
honor.
he
was
appointed
as
a
special
prosecutor
on
march
31st
of
1983.
at
that
point
in
time,
the
formal
investigation
began.
prior
to
that--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--there
had
just
been
conversations--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--yes,
the
sting
did
begin.
the
evidence
that
was
introduced
at
trial,
though,
didn't...
was
created
under
the
special
prosecutor's
mandate.
and
that
all...
and
that
was
at
a
point
in
time
when
he
was
representing
the
united
states
and
representing
vuitton.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
that's
caused
some
confusion,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--that
has
caused
some
confusion,
your
honor.
as
you
obviously
know,
the
government
has
submitted
amicus
briefs
supporting
the
notion
that
the
prosecutor
should
be
disinterested.
i
don't
think
that
the
mere
labelling
someone
as
a
special
prosecutor,
as
a
united
states
attorney,
ought
to
dispose
of
this
case.
it's
just...
and
this
case
really
illustrates,
i
think,
why
not.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
i
meant
that
i
understand
that's
a
fact.
i
have
some
problems
with
it
as
well.
speaking
of
the
u.s.
attorney,
judge
brieant,
who
i
think
was
initially
sensitive
to
the
possibility
that
some
problems
would
exist,
and
also
to
the
alleged
magnitude
of
the
case,
as
it
was
explained
to
him,
directed
mr.
brieant...
mr.
brieant;
mr.
bainton,
on
april
6th
to...
which
is
about
five
days
into
the...
into
the
taped
portion
of
the
sting,
and
about
five
days
after
he
was
appointed
special
prosecutor...
to,
quote,
fully
debrief
the
united
states
attorney.
well,
he...
he...
i
think,
your
honor,
and
i
have
to
go
back
to
the
transcript
to
be
sure,
he
directed
mr.
bainton
to
fully
debrief
the
u.s.
attorney,
and
said
that
he
wasn't
requiring
the
united
states
attorney
to
come
in;
that
it
was
simply
a
suggestion.
in
any
event,
i
don't
think
it's
important
to
quarrel
over
whether
he
was
directed
or
whether
it
was
suggested.
the
full
debriefing
never
occurred.
mr.
bainton
sent
a
short,
two
paragraph
letter,
which
is
in
the
appendix,
to
mr.
pedowitz,
who
was
at
that
point,
was
chief
of
the
criminal
division.
and
apparently
never
receiving
a
reply,
contacted
him
sometime
later,
and
the
reply
was
apparently
"good
luck".
the
u.s.
attorney
was
never
fully
offered
this
case.
the
matter
was
never
referred
to
the
united
states
attorney
by
the
district
court.
in
short,
the
procedure
suggested
by
the
government,
that
is,
the
solicitor
general's
office,
in
their
brief,
were
never
complied
with
in
this
case.
the
tapes
and
the
conversations
that
occurred
during
the
investigation
covered
a
wide
variety
of
topics.
they
first
discussed
the
defamation
action.
and
there
was
an
apparent
attempt
on
the
tapes
by
mr.
weinberg
to
elicit
an
admission
from
sol
klayminc
that
in
fact
the
defamation
action
was
frivolous.
there
was
an
attempt
to
discover
the
financial
assets
of
sol
klayminc.
it
also
discussed,
in
fact...
discussed
mostly
plans
to
manufacture
counterfeit
bags
in
haiti.
also
discussed
in
the
tapes,
or
stated
on
the
tapes,
were
suggestions
by
weinberg
in
response
to
inquiries
from
one
or
more
of
the
defendants
in
this
case
that
in
fact
the
proposed
plan
to
manufacture
bags
in
haiti
and
distribute
them
elsewhere
was
not
illegal.
and
i
just
would
wish
to
emphasize
that
those
kinds
of
lulling
statements
occur,
not
in
the
context
of
a
heroin
conspiracy
or
a
cocaine
conspiracy,
something
that
it
is
beyond
any
doubt
at
all
is
wrong,
and
you
don't
need
to
be
told
that
it
is
not,
this
occurs
in
the
context
of
an
injunction
which
had
very
specific,
proper
business
purposes,
to
protect
vuitton's
trademark
rights.
in
that
context,
suggesting
to
someone,
as
weinberg
did
time
and
time
again,
that
the
plan
that
they
were
discussing,
and
the
scheme,
if
you
will,
that
was
afoot,
would
not
violate
the
injunction
is
particularly
offensive.
the
interests
that
the
special
prosecutor
labored
under
here
were
not
only
the
duty
to
vuitton.
in
fact,
there
was
another
client,
fendi,
who
was
also
apparently
a
very
expensive
trademark,
because
mr....
mr.
bainton
also
represented
fendi.
and
in
fact,
in
discharging
mr.
rochman,
who
was
originally
a
defendant
in
this
case,
from
his
civil
obligations
for
vuitton
as
attorney
for
fendi,
mr.
bainton
discharged
mr.
rochman
as
well.
and
that's
contained
in
a
letter
that
is
also
in
the
appendix.
there's
the
$100,000
judgment
against
sol
klayminc
and
the
family
companies,
including
barry
klayminc.
that
was...
as
i
say,
payment
was
stopped
on
that
with
about
$81,000
left
to
pay.
there's
a
$750,000
judgment
against
petitioner
young.
petitioner
young
was
involved
in
a
case
in
california
in
1981,
in
which
he
agreed
to
an
injunction
prohibiting
him
from
manufacturing,
selling,
offering
to
sell,
counterfeit
louis
vuitton
bags.
as
a
part
of
that
agreement,
there
was
a
liquidated
damages
provision
of
$750,000
that
would
only
become
due
and
owing
if
young
violated
that
injunction.
in
addition
to
that,
there's
a
personal
interest
the
special
prosecutor
had,
because
he
was
a
defendant
in
a
defamation
action
which
was
begun
before
the
sting.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
that
is
the
suit,
your
honor.
and
the
fact
that
it
was
frivolous...
and
i'm
not
qualified
to
say
whether
it
was
frivolous,
and
with
all
due
respect
to
judge
lombard,
i
don't
think
that
he
is
either...
there
is...
there
is
nothing...
there
is
nothing
that
prevents
or
has
been
explored,
mr.
bainton
from
being
concerned
about
that.
the
suit
was
for
two
a
quarter
million
dollars.
somebody
hired
a
lawyer
to
represent
him.
the
matter
was
discontinued
after
a
claim
of
prosecutorial
immunity.
now,
whether
or
not
it
was
frivolous
is
really
not
the
point.
what
we're
really
talking
about
here
is
an
appearance
of
a
conflict
of
interest.
and
i
think
it
clearly
existed
when
the
prosecutor
is
a
defendant
in
a
suit
such
as
that
brought
before
any
prosecution.
his
law
firm
was
also
defendant
in
that
action.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
yes,
your
honor,
that's
correct.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
we've
taken
a
couple
of
different
positions
in
the
brief.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
the
answer
is
that
except
in
a
serious
contempt,
the
answer
is
yes.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
no.
for
a
serious
criminal
contempt,
the
private
attorney
for
an
underlying
party
should
never
be
appointed.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
oh,
no,
no,
no.
we
don't...
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
misunderstood
your
question.
we
do
agree
with
the
solicitor
general's
position
that
it
would
be
permissible
under
rule
42(b)
to
appoint
a
private,
disinterested
attorney.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
on
the
contrary,
your
honor,
there's
lot
of
former
prosecutors
out--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--a
private,
disinterested
attorney,
yes.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
no,
we
happen
to
agree
that
the
proper
procedure
of
considering
separation
of
powers
concept
should
be
to
at
least
refer
it
to
the
executive
branch.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well,
your
honor,
the
administrative
office
of
the
united
states
court
has
a
fund
which
has
been
used
to
pay
disinterested
private
attorneys
before
on
a
few
occasions.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
apparently,
yes,
your
honor.
there's
the
lodging
that
mr.
bainton
put
in,
a
letter
that
he
sent
to
the
administrative
office
of
the
courts;
and
there
are
conversations
that
the
solicitor
general
office...
solicitor
general's
office
has
had
with
the
general
counsel
of
that
unit.
and
apparently,
there
is
a
fund
from
which
to
pay.
now,
the
fund
is
not
overwhelming
in
amount.
and
it
hasn't
been
tapped
that
frequently.
but
it
has
been
tapped
in
at
least
three
occasions
that
we
know
of.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
no,
but
nor
are
lots
of
other
funds,
justice
scalia.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
well--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--i
think
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
but
to
the
extent
that
the
courts
will
always
have
to
depend
on
another
branch's
muscle,
if
you
will,
they're
always
at
that
mercy.
the
u.s.
attorney's
manual,
for
example,
and
the
justice
department,
by
their
very
presence
here,
i
think,
demonstrates
the
proper
respect
due
to
courts.
and
i
think
that
those
kinds
of
concerns,
whereas
i
don't
say
that
they're
completely
frivolous,
i
just
think
they're
not
very
real.
the
interesting
part
of
this
case
is
that
if
mr.
bainton
had
been
a
real
assistant
united
states
attorney
he
would
be
subject
to
prosecution
under
18
u.s.c.
208(a),
which
is
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
that
congress
has
passed
in
order
to
prevent
just
this
sort
of
thing.
if
i
may,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
james
a.
cohen
thank
you.
i'll
speak
quickly.
first
of
all,
with
all
due
respect,
justice
rehnquist,
the
system
in
this
country
at
the
time
of
the
constitution
was
a
system
of
public
prosecution.
not
only
that,
for
the
past
100,
150
years,
the
system
in
england
has
been
a
system
of
public
prosecution
at
least
as
it
would
apply
to
this
kind
of
case.
in
england,
the
police,
not
the
victim,
hire
the
private
attorney
to
manage...
to
prosecute
the
case.
second
of
all,
it
is
simply
not
true
that
mr.
bainton
went
to
the
u.s.
attorney
a
few
hours
after
the
appointment.
he
was
appointed
on
march
31st,
and
the
tapes
began
to
run.
and
they
ran
from
march
31st
until
april
6th.
that's
when
the
letter
went
out
to
the
united
states
attorney.
thirdly,
if
you
examine
the
appendix
at
pages
103
to
106,
you'll
see
letters
in
which
the
hats,
as
you
said,
justice
marshall,
kept
changing
between
the
special
prosecutor
hat
and
vuitton's
hat,
in
terms
of
making
deals
with
rochman,
and
then
the
lodging,
which
we
filed
with
the
clerk
of
the
court,
at
pages
l36
and
l39,
the
same
hat
sort
of
switched...
i
should
say;
well,
it
doesn't
matter...
with
respect
to
mr.
pariseault,
who
was
also
bargained
with,
depending
on
whose
interests
were
at
stake
at
that
particular
time.
finally--
mr.
james
a.
cohen
--thank
you.
