justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
major...
you
rely
chiefly
on
the
conflict
on
the
prosecutor
having
another
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
do...
do
you
argue
in
brief
that
a
private
attorney
should
never
be
appointed,
no
matter
who
he
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
the
answer
to
my
question,
yes
or
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
well,
do
you
abandon
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no,
but
how
about
any
private
attorney?
justice
byron
r.
white
whether
he's
ever
had...
been
in
a
criminal
court
in
his
whole
life?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i
know.
but
so
your
answer
is
that
the
court
may
appoint
a
private
attorney.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
need
not
refer
it
to
the
u.s.
attorney
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
in
your
view
would
be
the
objection
to
saying,
the
private
attorney
should
not
be
appointed,
especially
for
one
of
the
parties,
unless
the
united
states
attorney
refuses
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
it
should
first
be
presented
to
the
united
states--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
you
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--so
the
united
states
attorney,
you
think,
in
effect
if
not
expressly,
in
effect
declined
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
prior
to
your
appointment?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
it
ever
offered
to
him
prior
to
your
appointment?
justice
byron
r.
white
on
the
day.
by
whom?
justice
byron
r.
white
had
you
already
been
appointed?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
have
no
objection
if
the
judge
had
said,
well,
i...
we
should
give
the
u.s.
attorney
first
crack
before
you're
even
appointed?
