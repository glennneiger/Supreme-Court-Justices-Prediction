justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen,
help
me
out
on
one
other...
mr.
cohen,
the
thing
on
the
sting.
there
was
taping
with
a
videotape,
is
that
what
it
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
but
could
those
tapes...
forget
for
a
moment
ethical
obligation...
did
that
taping
violate
any
state
law
or
federal
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
does
his
status
as
a
special
prosecutor
exempt
him
from
california
state
law?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
regardless
of
whether
he
had
the
court
approval?
just
flatly--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
apart
from
the
california
incident,
you
don't
claim
there's
any
violation
of
law?
just
a
violation
of
ethical
responsibilities
for
a
lawyer
to
supervise
this
kind
of
an
operation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
ethical
concern
is
that
lawyers
aren't
supposed
to
lie;
is
that
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
other...
because
they
often,
i
know
in
these
trademark
infringement
situations,
they
often
employ
private
investigators
who
take
on
a
role
of
someone
whom
they
really
aren't,
and
tell
a
lot
of
falsehoods.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
that...
you
think
all
of
those
activities
are
ethically
improper
for
a
lawyer
to
permit
people
working
on
his
side
of
the
case
to
engage
in?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
that...
i
understand
your
conflict
of
interest
argument.
but
apart
from
that,
you
think
that
it's
wrong
for
a
lawyer
in
a
trademark
infringement,
or
one
of
these
cases,
to
employ
private
investigators
who
use
a
cover
story
and
a
lot
of
falsehoods?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
really,
my
bottom
line
is,
i'm
just
not
quite
clear
on
why
the
sting
has
much
to
do
with
your
basic
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
isn't
a
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
my
point
is,
it
isn't
even
a
crime.
0
xxx.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
point
is,
he
would
otherwise
be
able
to
do
it,
as
a
purely
private
lawyer.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
could
hire
a
detective
firm...
why
couldn't
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
think
you
just...
well,
i
don't.
i
thought
you
just
said
to
me
it
was
common
in
enforcement
of
this
kind
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--sure,
but
under
the
supervision
of
a
lawyer.
and
that's
what
you've
got
here.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bainton,
with
your
very
good
example
of
blackacre,
wasn't
the
remedy
one
of
ejectment,
which
was
enforceable
by
an
executive
officer?
he
didn't
have
to
go
back
to
court
to
enforce
an
ejectment
order.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bainton,
would
the
case
be
different
if
your
client
had
both
a
claim
for
damages,
because
of
a
lot
of
trademark
infringement
and
the
like,
which
would
be
enforceable
by
a
civil
contempt,
as
well
as
the
criminal
proceeding?
would
then
there
be
a
conflict?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
that
case,
if
you
represented
both
the
court's
interest
in
enforcement
and
your
client's
interest
in
obtaining
money,
would
it
be
proper
for
you
to
agree
to
dismiss
the
criminal
charges
if
there
were
full
payment
of
all
damage
claims?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
agreed,
maybe...
enter
into
an
agreement
by
which
you,
in
exchange
for
the
payment
of
whatever
the
amount
the
damages
were
or
alleged
to
be,
you
agreed
to
recommend
to
the
court
that
they
would
be...
the
criminal
charges
would
be
dismissed.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
change
the
example
a
little
bit.
supposing
the
settlement
was,
in
addition
to
not
recommending,
you
also
agree
that
you
will
not
offer
in
evidence
the
results
of
the
sting
operation.
you
just
wouldn't
call
that
to
the
court's
attention.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
would
be
a
conflict
of
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
you
have
an
obligation
to
the
judge
to
disclose
all
evidence
that
you
have
in
your
possession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
your
client
said,
i
really
think
you're
being
too
hard
on
this
particular
adversary.
i
really
don't
think
it's
in
our
best
business
interest
in
the
long
run
to
go
forward
with
these
kinds
of
contempts
because
of
customer
relations,
one
thing
or
another.
what
would
you
do
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question,
if
i
may.
what
would
you
ethical
obligation
be
if
your
private
client
went
bankrupt
and
there
just
weren't
funds
to
pay
your
privately?
then
what
would
you
do
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bainton,
may
i--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
if
you
had
a
different
kind
of
crime,
shortage
of
u.s.
attorneys
to
prosecute,
and
the
prosecutor
tells
a
victim,
we
just
don't
have
enough
lawyers
to
keep
this
case
on
the
docket.
and
the
victim
says,
well,
i've
got
a
lawyer
and
i'll
pay
him
if
he
can
handle
the
prosecution.
would
there
be
any
problem
with
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
stick
with
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
stick
with
my
hypothetical.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
stick
with
my
hypothetical
for
a
minute.
what
would
be
wrong,
if
anything,
with
just
doing
that?
would
there
be
any
ethical
problems?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
either
the
judge
or
the
u.s.
attorney
says,
we
don't
have
enough
lawyers
to
go
around.
we
will
designate
you
attorney
for
the
government
for
the
purpose
of
this
case,
even
though
we
know
you
are
the
attorney
for
the
victim,
and
your
particular
interest
in
it
is
remedying
the
wrong
of
the
victim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
assuming
power,
would
there
be
any
ethical
objection
to
such
an
arrangement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
seems
to
me
it's
quite
a
close
parallel.
because
you
have
the
same
relationship
with
the
victim
of
this
wrongdoing
as
in
my
hypothesis
the
lawyer
would
have
with
the
victim
of
the
ordinary
street
crime?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
put
it
differently.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
if
congress
passed
a
law
and
said,
we
think
this
is
a
good
way
to
get
a
lot
of
backlog
out.
we
would
recommend
a
procedure.
this
would
be
done
on
a
routine
basis.
i
think
you'd
suggest
that's
a
good
idea.
