mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
chief
justice's
last
question
indicates
to
me
that
the
court
is
focussing
on
the
real
issue
presented
by
this
case,
and
that
is,
how
are
the
federal
courts
going
to
enforce
their
orders?
this
court,
in
its
decision,
among
others,
in
gompers
and
debs
has
long
recognized...
we
agree,
petitioners
agree,
and
the
solicitor
general
agrees...
that
if
the
judiciary
is
to
maintain
its
status
as
a
coequal
branch
of
government,
it
has
to
have
the
ability
to
enforce
its
orders.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
through
the
executive
branch,
your
honor.
but
that...
your
honor,
that
is
not...
that
is
not
what
this
court
held
in
gompers.
that's
not
what
this
court
held
in
mccann...
excuse
me,
in
in
re
debs.
i
think
that
if
a
federal
court
is
going
to
be
able
to
maintain
its
status
as
an
equal
branch
of
government,
it
simply
has
to
be
able
to
enforce
its
orders.
this
court
has
consistently
held
that,
and
no
one
has
contended
to
the
contrary.
so
i
suggest
that
the
real
issue
is,
how
do
you
do
that?
and
the
only...
and
the
historical
answer
to
that
question,
and
the
oldest--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--1911,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
1911
is
the
oldest
i
have,
which
is
gompers,
your
honor.
the
first
appointment
is
in
re
debs,
which
was
decided
by
this
court
in
1895.
the
rule
42(b)
was
enacted
in
1946.
now,
in
professor
orfields...
who
was
the
reporter
to
the
advisory
committee
on
the
federal
rules
treatise...
he
indicated
that
the
advisory
committee
and
therefore
presumptively
this
court,
in
enacting
rule
42(b),
meant
to
codify
prior
existing
practice.
and
the
prior
existing
practice
was
described
in
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
mccann
v.
new
york
stock
exchange.
in
that
case,
the
second
circuit
held
that
it
was
not
only
allowable,
but
the
preferred
practice,
in
cases
such
as
this
one,
for
the
court
to
specially
appoint
the
attorney
for
the
civil
litigant
aggrieved
by
the
disobedience
of
the
federal
court
order.
now
rule
57
of
the
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
also
comes
into
play
to
the
extent
that
it
says,
in
substance,
any...
that...
excuse
me,
as
it
says
in
substance
that
all
prior
practice
is
not
excluded.
to
the
extent
that
the
court
does
not
find
adequate
authority
to
do
what
it
did
within
rule
42(b),
which
is
what
the
district
court
found
in
both
opinions
and
the
second
circuit,
we
suggest
that
the
power
question
can
be
resolved
ultimately
by
reference
to
the
all
writs
act.
so
i
don't
think
that
there
is
a
serious
question
as
to
whether
the
court
has
the
power
to
do
what
it
did
in
this
and
other
cases.
of
course,
it
can't
exercise
this
power
in
a
way
that
deprives
a
defendant
of
his
due
process
rights.
and
that
is
the
question
that
is
really
presented
by
this
case.
what
has...
what
this
court
i
think
has
to
do
is
balance
the
interests
of
an
independent
judiciary
against
the
risk
that
this
process
might
somehow
compromise
the
rights
of
a
defendant.
in
that
balancing
process,
i
think
the
most
important
factor
for
the
court
to
take
into
account
is
the
very
special
role
that
the
district
court
judge
plays
in
these
cases.
as
mr.
bryson
pointed
out,
the
decision
to
prosecute,
to
continue
the
prosecution,
is
not
reposed
with
the
district...
excuse
me,
with
the
civil
litigant's
lawyer.
the
decision
in
this
case,
and
musidor
and
mccann
and
the
others,
confers
no
right
on
a
civil
litigant.
as
a
result
of
the
second
circuit's
opinion,
no
civil
litigant
can
go
to
a
district
court
judge
and
say,
i
have
a
trademark,
i
have
an
injunction,
and
i
have
what
i
think
is
evidence
of
probable
cause
of
a
violation
of
that
injunction.
i
want
a
criminal
prosecution.
that
decision
rests
completely
within
the
discretion
of
the
district
court
judge.
and
that's
important.
and
i
think
that
answers
most,
if
not
all,
of
the
arguments
raised
both
by
the
petitioners
and
the
solicitor
general.
there
exists
within
our
system
of
justice
a
series
of
systemic
safeguards
that
we
think
adequately
protect
any
possible
compromise
of
the
defendant's
right
to
a
fair
trial;
not
a
perfect
trial,
a
fair
trial.
as
this
court
held
in
marshall
v.
jerrico,
there
is
not
a
constitutional
right
to
a
completely
unbiased
prosecutor.
in
that
case,
the
court
used
the
phrase,
too
remote
and
insubstantial.
and
that's
what
i
most
respectfully
suggest
the
complaint's
about
this
practice
are,
too
remote
and
insubstantial.
there
has
been
no
claim
that
anything
that
occurred
in
this
case,
or
any
other
case
to
my
knowledge,
was
improper,
was
different
than
the
u.s.
attorney
under
different
circumstances
might
have
done.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
your
honor,
if
i'm
not
mistaken,
i
believe
that
case
was
brought
by
the
justice
department,
wasn't
it?
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
what
you're
saying
is,
by
analogy,
if
a
private
party
had
sought
the
same
sort
of
relief,
and
obtained
it?
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
your
honor,
i
don't
know
that--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
is
your
job
to
decide
what
your
judgment
means.
and
if
you...
and
having
done
that,
you
have
to
enforce
that.
let
me
give
you
an
example,
if
i
may,
going
to
the
old
law
school
example
of
blackacre.
the
federal
district
court
judge
says,
mr.
bainton,
you
can
have
possession
of
blackacre.
i
go
to
blackacre,
and
the
person
there
is
standing
there
with
a
shotgun
and
says,
if
you
step
across
that
border,
i'm
going
to
blow
your
brains
out.
i
go
back
to
the
district
court
judge.
he
sends
me
to
the
u.s.
attorney.
the
u.s.
attorney
says,
you
know,
that's
terrible.
the
judge
said
you're
entitled
to
have
possession
of
blackacre.
but
i'm
very
busy.
we
have
a
big
cocaine
trial
in
this
district.
i
don't
have
anybody
to
help
you.
i
go
back
to
the
district
court
judge
and
say,
judge,
i
haven't
got
possession
of
blackacre.
what
are
you
going
to
do
about
it?
the
judge
says,
well,
can't
help
you.
the
u.s.
attorney
can't...
the
u.s.
attorney
has
to
act
as
a
check
and
balance.
and
although
my
order
is
plain
and
clear
and
in
no
way
ambiguous,
it
won't
be
enforced.
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
courts
have
to
enforce
their
orders.
they
have
to
have
the
ability
to
enforce
their
orders.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
your
honor...
your
honor,
when...
when
the
executive
branch
declines
to
enforce
a
court
order,
rightfully
or
wrongfully,
a
court
must
be
able
to
see
that
that
order
is
given
force
and
effect.
what
happens
when...
i'll
give
you
another
example...
what
happens
when
someone
subpoenas
some
tapes
from
the
white
house,
and
the
subpoena
is
not
complied
with.
and
the...
and
the
attorney
general
says,
we're
not
going
to
seek
to
enforce
that
order.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
surely
the
district
court
must
be
able
to
compel
the
production
of
those
tapes
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
the
attorney
general
could
have,
your
honor,
yes.
not
the
u.s.
attorney.
the
attorney
general.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
oh,
i'm
sorry,
i
see
your
question.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
i
don't
think,
your
honor--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--no,
i
don't
agree,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
your
honor...
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the...
that
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest.
the
interests
of
the
civil
litigant
in
this
case
were
coterminous,
no
more
and
no
less,
than
that
of
the
district
court;
and
that
is,
that
the
court's
order
be
enforced.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
i'm
sorry,
i
didn't
hear
you.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
yes,
but
the--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--we're
talking
about
interests,
though,
justice
marshall.
and
the
interests--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--i
had
one
interest,
and
that
is
that
the
court
order
be
obeyed.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
pardon
me,
sir?
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
no,
that
is
not
correct,
sir.
that
is
not
correct.
my
client...
the
court's
interests,
and
my
interests,
are
simply
that
court
orders
be
obeyed.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
no,
your
honor,
i--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--your
honor,
there
is
no
question--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--as
to
which
hat
i'm
wearing.
and
the
record
in
this
case
is
pristine
in
the
sense
that
i
have,
rightly
or
wrongly,
represented
the
united
states
of
america
from
the
time
of
my
appointment.
the--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--your
honor,
as
to
who
i
appeared
for,
i'm
sorry,
i
respectfully
disagree;
that
is
the
word
i
chose
to
use.
there
has
been
no
question
at
any
stage
in
this
proceeding
that
it
was
other
than
a
criminal
proceeding.
which
is
required,
at
least
under
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
mccann.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
no,
sir.
that's
true
in
every
case,
and
there's
no
practical
conflict.
and
let
me
explain
why
if
i
may.
the
burden
of
proof
in
any
criminal
case
is
obviously
proof
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
in
a
civil
case,
it's--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--your
honor,
i
couldn't
agree
to
do
that.
that
is
not
within
the
special
prosecutor's
power.
and
that's
the
point
i
made
earlier.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
you're
saying,
would
that
create...
potentially
create
a
conflict
of
interest?
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
yes.
it
would
potentially
create
a
conflict
of
interest.
i
suppose.
i
think
i
can't
say
that
it
doesn't.
but
i
think
that
what
you've
got
to
do
in
deciding
this
case
is,
again,
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
risk
that
the
entitlement
to
the
defendant
of
a
fair
trial
will
be
compromised.
and
whether
or
not
this
case
is
going
to
be...
whether
my
recommendation
would
be
accepted
or
rejected
by
the
district
court
rests
in
its
discretion.
and
i
think
it's
fair
to
say
that
in
these
cases
the
district
courts
generally
look
at
recommendations
of
special
prosecutors
with
respect
to
the
disposition
of
a
criminal
matter,
including
its
commencement.
some
look
differently--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--i
couldn't
do
that.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
that
would
be
unethical.
when--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--i
think
i
have
an...
had
and
continue
to
have
an
unqualified
obligation
to
the
united
states
of
america
to
give
it
the
best
representation
of
which
i
am
capable.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
well,
then,
i'd
have
to
make
a
decision.
i'd
have
to
ask
whether
or
not
to
be
relieved
from
the
prosecution
because
there
was
no
fund
left
to
pay
me.
that's
what
i'd
have
to
do.
i
could
not
abandon
my
ethical
obligation
to
my
client
because
i
was
no
longer
getting
paid.
i
could
asked
to
be
relieved.
if
i
was
relieved,
then
i
suppose
one
of
these
other
solutions,
if
they
were
possible,
would
come
into
play.
but
i
don't
think
i
could
throw
the
case,
if
you
will.
the...
there
is
an
analogy,
i
think,
in
civil
practice,
everyday
of
the
week,
because
lawyers
take
oaths
to
obey
the
law,
they
produce
documents
in
civil
litigation
that
are
terribly
prejudicial
to
their
client.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
your
honor,
once
accepting
the
engagement,
i
think
i'm
bound
to
see
it
through
to
its
conclusion
unless
excused
by
the
district
court
judge.
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that.
and
that's
no
different
than
appearing
in
any
federal
action.
once
you
appear
on
behalf
of
a
party,
you're
in
the
lawsuit
unless,
in
the
exercise
of
its
discretion,
the
district
court
judge
lets
you
out.
i
don't
think
is
any
different
from
any
other
case
in
that
respect.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
i
have
no...
utterly
no
problem
with
that,
sir.
in
this
case--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--as
a
matter
of
good
practice,
not
necessarily
of
constitutional
law.
i
don't
think
the
constitution
requires
that.
i
think
that
good
practice
suggests
it.
it
occurred
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
point
out,
not
once
but
twice.
mr.
cohen,
in
his
remarks,
suggested
that
the
debriefing
never
occurred.
that,
the
record
demonstrates,
is
utterly
untrue.
i
produced
to
the
united
states
attorney
every
scintilla
of
information--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--i
had
at
the
time--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--no,
sir,
i
think
he
expressly
declined
the
prosecution
not
once
but
twice.
judge
brieant,
as
the
record
shows,
on
the
eve
of
trial,
again
called
the
united
states
attorney's
office,
and
again
offered
them...
not
ordered
them,
but
offered
them...
the
opportunity
to
try
the
case,
and
they
declined.
so
the
u.s.
attorney
expressly
declined
to
prosecute
this
case
not
once
but
twice.
now,
in--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--no,
sir.
no,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
no,
sir,
it
was
offered
to
him
on
the
day
of
my
appointment;
literally
on
the
day.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
at
judge
brieant's
request,
i
delivered
to
the
u.s.
attorney
the
affidavit
submitted
in
support
of
my...
in
support
of
the
application
for
my
appointment.
and
your
honor,
that
affidavit
contained
every
bit
of
information
about
this
case
that
i
then
knew.
and
when
the
u.s.
attorney
had
that
affidavit--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--yes,
sir,
i
had.
by...
by...
for
a
duration
of
a
number
of
hours.
and
as
the...
as
mr.
cohen
correctly
stated--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--yes,
sir.
but
contrary
to
what
the
solicitor
general
said,
i
know
of
my
own
personal
knowledge
of
four
cases,
three
in
the
central
district
of
california
and
one
in
the
southern
district
of
new
york,
within
the
last
eight
to
ten
months,
when
the
u.s.
attorney
has,
on
each
occasion,
been
offered
this
opportunity,
and
has
declined,
and
i
have
been
appointed.
so
the
statement
by
the
solicitor
general
that
this
court
can
assume
that
the
justice
department
will
regularly
prosecute
this
case
is
at
least
inconsistent
with
my
personal
experience.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
i
gave
them
to
the
head
of
the
criminal
division
of
the
u.s.
attorney's
office.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
which
i
thought
was
the
appropriate.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
no,
that's
correct,
justice
marshall.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
that's
correct.
i
gave
it
to
the
head
of
the
criminal
division;
not
to
the
u.s.
attorney
himself.
you're
correct.
i
apologize
for
the
misstatement.
assuming--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
who's
we?
this
court
or
the
district
court?
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
okay.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
in
that
example,
i
think
as
a
practical
matter,
you're
absolutely
correct.
but
i
think
there
is
a
qualitative,
justice
scalia,
between
setting
up
a
court
order...
an
entirely
court-maintained
prison
system
and
enforcing
a
court's
order.
federal
courts,
certainly
in
the
desegregation
cases,
have
run
school
districts.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
so...
so,
you
know,
but
it's--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--but
your
example,
sir,
i
most
respectfully
suggest,
is
largely
speculative.
the
likelihood
of
the
marshall
service
declining
to
incarcerate
someone,
i
most
respectfully
submit,
is
slim
or
none.
the
likelihood
of
an
already
overburdened
u.s.
attorney's
office
to
say,
i
haven't
got
the
personnel
to
prosecute
this
case
is
a
real
problem.
that
is
a
problem
that
has
prompted
this
rule
of
law.
and,
while
conceptually
you're
right,
justice
scalia,--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--i
think
the
real
problem
you've
got
to
deal
with
is
the
one
that
was
dealt
with
by
the
second
circuit.
and
i'd
most
respectfully
suggest,
the
one
you
pose
is
never
going
to
occur.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
because
the
interests
of
the
judiciary,
and
the
enforcement
of
its
orders,
are
different,
justice
scalia,
than
the
legitimate
and
proper
interests
of
the
justice...
of
the
executive
branch.
this
court
cannot
compel
the
executive
branch
to
prosecute
any
criminal
regardless
of
how
heinous
his
conduct.
that's
implicit
in
the
notion
of
separation
of
powers.
but
if
this
is
going
to
be
a
coequal
branch,
it
has
to
support
its
orders.
and
to
answer
the
question
i
posed,
why
is
the
agenda
different,
as
the
district
court
found
in
this
case,
orders
of
this
type
are
routinely
ignored.
as
a
result,
the
case
load
of
the
district
court,
which
it
has
to
deal
with...
there
is
no
way
that
the
district
court
can
prevent
trademark
owners
from
filing
lawsuits
such
as
the
civil
lawsuit
from
which
this
case
arises...
they
want
to
stop
the
flood
of
cases.
they
want
their
orders
respected.
because
when
federal
court
orders
are
obeyed,
then
unnecessary
civil
contempt
proceedings
won't
occur.
the
interest
of
the
district
court
is
in
people
obeying
the
order.
and
the
order
is
no
magic.
the
order
says,
defendant,
thou
shalt
do
what
congress
has
already
told
you
to
do
under
the
trademark
act.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
yes,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
yes,
if
the
judge
is
going
to
appoint
him.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
i
think
that...
i
think
that
the...
and
there
is
provision,
happens
all
the
time
in
securities
fraud
cases
when
representatives
of
the
sec
are
specially
appointed
by
the
attorney
general
to
prosecute
criminal
securities
cases
or
criminal
anti-trust
cases.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
so
that
provision
is
there.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
it's
never
been
used
in
the
way
you
suggest,
sir,
but
it
could
be.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
who
is
doing
it?
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
well,
the
answer
to
the
question
really
depends...
depends
in
large
part
on
who
does
it.
the
court
doesn't
have
the
power
to
do
it,
under
separation
of
powers.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
if
the
attorney
general
were
to
do
it.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
i
think...
i
think
under
the
statute
cited
by
the
attorney
general
there
might...
it
would
be
unlawful
for
the
attorney
general
to
make
such
an
appointment--
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
--because
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
the...
the...
there
are
two
parts
to
the
answer
to
that
question,
sir.
the
first
part
is,
the
only
person
who
could
make
such
an
appointment
is
the
attorney
general
of
the
united
states.
secondly,
the
conflict
of
interest
statute
cited
by
the
solicitor
general
would
make
such
an
appointment
as
a
proposition
of
statutory
law
by
the
attorney
general
unlawful
and
therefore
improper.
now,
the
next
question,
i
suppose,
is,
suppose
that
statute
didn't
exist,
that
statute
was
not
a
bar
to
such
action
by
the
attorney
general,
would
there
be
an
ethical
problem?
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
that's
correct,
sir.
mr.
j.
joseph
bainton
that's
correct.
i'm
running
out
of
time.
i
would
like
to
talk
briefly
about
the
request
that
this
court
exercise
its
supervisory
powers
to
change
the
practice
under
rule
42(b).
we
think
that
that
is
very
ill-advised,
because
this
court
writes
the
criminal
rules
of
procedure.
this...
an
advisory
committee
exists,
and
neither
the
petitioner
nor
the
solicitor
general
has
offered
any
reason
to
depart
from
the
usual
practice
under
18
u.s.c.
section
3771.
in
other
words,
if
you
conclude
that
this
practice
doesn't
violate
the
due
process
rights
of
defendants,
generally,
or
more
particularly,
the
defendants
in
this
case,
but
you
nonetheless
say,
maybe
this...
maybe
there's
a
better
way.
and
i'm
an
optimist.
i'd
always
like
to
think
there's
a
better
way.
i
most
respectfully
suggest
that
neither
petitioners
nor
the
solicitor
general
have
offered
you
one,
and
i
personally
don't
know
of
one.
but
perhaps
it
exists.
then
there's
a
procedure
so
this
court
can
draw
upon
the
collective
wisdom
of
scholars,
of
practicing
lawyers,
of
u.s.
attorneys
and
of
lower
federal
judges.
and
i
think
that
practice
should
be
followed
by
this
court,
if
it's
so
inclined,
and
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
exercise
its
supervisory
powers
in
the
context
of
this
case.
i
believe
two
other
points
and
i'm
done.
i
believe
justice
blackmun
asked
mr.
cohen
about
the
state
law
of
california
with
respect
to
the
taping.
in
the
district
court's
opinion
at
592-748,
it
discusses
a
line
of
ninth
circuit
cases
which
say
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
for
the
state
of
california
to
proscribe
the
manner
in
which
federal
law
enforcement
officers
can
conduct
an
investigation.
and
therefore,
it
would
be
improper
for
california
to
tell
the
fbi
or
any
other
federal
law
enforcement
officer
that
it
cannot
engage
in
one-way
electronic
eavesdropping.
in
its
opinion
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
that
construction
of
the
statute
was
ridiculous,
and
therefore
rejected
it.
and
finally,
i'd
like
to
emphasize
that
justice
scalia's
point
about
the
investigation,
the
remarks
about...
the
remarks
by
petitioners
about
the...
about
the
impropriety
of
the
investigation,
i
think,
are
the
largest
red
herring
in
this
case.
justice
scalia,
i
believe
you're
absolutely
right
when
you
say
that
this
is
what
happens
in
investigations
of
trademark
counterfeiting
everyday
of
the
week.
the
only
thing
that
judge
lasker's
order
changed
from
what
would
occur
on
a
garden
variety
case
is,
we
have
videotapes
and
audio
tapes
of
what
was
said.
we
have,
i
most
respectfully
submit,
the
best
evidence
of
what
occurred
on
those
occasions.
and
that
can
do
nothing
but
to
protect
the
legitimate
interests
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
thank
you.
