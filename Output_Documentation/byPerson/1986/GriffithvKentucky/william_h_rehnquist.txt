chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
85-5221,
griffith
against
kentucky.
mr.
aprile,
we
will
hear
from
you
first.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
aprile,
does
your
submission
embrace
what
is
referred
to
as
justice
harlan's
view
on
the
subject,
where
i
believe
he
said
that
all
cases
on
direct
review
not
final
should
get
the
benefit
of
the
new
rule,
but
none
on
habeas
corpus
should
get
the
benefit?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
do
you
conceive
the
pre-linkletter
law,
as
you
refer
to
it,
to
be
with
respect
to
cases
that
had
become
final
and
were
on
habeas
corpus
review
or
some
sort
of
collateral
attack?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
you
know,
if
you're
talking
about
the
desirability
of
a
rule
that
everyone
will
know
it's
in
effect
the
minute
a
decision
comes
down,
isn't
there
also
a
good
claim
for
a
bright
line
rule
in
the
collateral
attack
that
it
does
not
get
retroactivity?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
you're
getting
into
kind
of
the
weighing
of
factors
and
so
forth,
certainly
the
reliance
element
militates
against
you
here,
it
seems
to
me.
obviously,
there
were
people
who
did
rely
on
the
validity
of
the
swain
decision
at
the
time
cases
were
tried,
even
though
they
hadn't
become
final.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
aprile.
we'll
hear
next
from
you,
mr.
richwalsky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
richwalsky.
do
you
have
anything
more,
mr.
aprile?
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
aprile.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-5731,
willie
davis
brown,
aka
will
brown,
petitioner,
versus
the
united
states.
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
haddad.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
problem
with
getting
the
court
to
ever
adopt
the
harlan
approach
is
that
we
seldom
have
a
case
here
in
which
both
sides
of
the
thing
are
involved.
that
is,
it
would
take
an
opinion
of
the
court,
say,
a
holding
in
the
technical
sense
that
on
habeas
corpus
there
is
no
retroactivity
perhaps
with
minor
exceptions;
on
direct
review
there
is
always
retroactivity.
but
we
tend
to
get
our
cases,
it
is
either
a
direct
review
or
a
habeas
corpus,
and
so
it
is
hard
to
get
the
court
to
coalesce
around
a
proposition
that
would
apply
to
both
situations.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
robinson
against
neil
was
an
application
of
the
stovail
against
denno
test,
not
an
application
of
justice
harlan's
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
think
it
is
a
very
poor
example
of
what
you
are
talking
about,
is
what
i
am
trying
to
say.
but
you
are
entitled,
obviously,
to
convince
my
eight
colleagues
that
you
are
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
would
bode
ill
for
your
case
if
the
language
that
justice
brennan
just
read
to
you
were
controlling
in
this
case
in
view
of
our
decision
last
spring
in
allen
against
hardy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
haddad.
we
will
hear
next
from
you,
mr.
bryson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
mean
batson?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
whether
batson
constituted
a
change?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bryson.
mr.
haddad,
do
you
have
something
further?
you
have
17
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
