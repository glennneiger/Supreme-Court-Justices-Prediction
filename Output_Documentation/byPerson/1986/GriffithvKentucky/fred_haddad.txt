mr.
fred
haddad
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
if
i
may,
the
court
has
already
heard
argument
somewhat
on
this
issue.
i
would
like
to
address
the
facts
momentarily
in
the
case
in
that
i
think
it
may
have
a
bearing
on
what
i
would
argue
in
response
to
what
justice
blackmun
asked
at
the
initial
opening
argument
in
griffith.
in
this
case
the
defendant,
a
black
man,
was
charged
with
a
co-defendant,
another
black
man,
with
violations
of
the
conspiracy
narcotics
laws,
and
was
put
to
trial
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
western
district
of
oklahoma.
five
black
people
were
called
for
the
jury,
three
of
which
were
excused
for
cause
by
the
court,
two
of
whom
were
excused
by
the
prosecutor
peremptorily,
and
there
was
an
objection
made,
and
the
defendants
or
petitioner
sought
to...
a
request
of
the
trial
judge
for
the...
and
a
couple
of
additional
challenges
in
an
effort
to
seek
some
black
members
of
the
venire
that
were
still
available
as
well
as
an
objection
to
the
prosecutor's
employment
of
his
challenges
to
exclude
black
people
who
responded
on
voir
dire
in
a
manner
sufficient
to
indicate
that
they
could
be
fair
in
the
case.
as
it
turned
out
during
the
second
day
of
jury
deliberation
counsel
were
made
aware
that
during
a
break
between
the
first
venire
and
the
second
venire
the
united
states
attorney
or
assistant
united
states
attorney,
mr.
richardson,
had
made
a
telephone
call
to
the
jury
clerk
asking
her
the
composition
of
those
who
would
be
calling
or
coming
and
asking
her
not
to
bring
any
jurors,
as
he
recalled
it,
or
don't
get
any
blacks
on
the
jury,
as
she
recalled
it.
a
hearing
was
then
had
during
the...
excuse
me.
we
had
a
hearing
while
the
jury
was
deliberating,
and
at
that
hearing
mr.
richardson
attested
to
the
fact
that
he
took
into
consideration
that
the
defendants
were
black
and
that
their
lawyer
was
black,
and
that
their
lawyer
was
a
prominent
black
member
of
the
oklahoma
state
senate,
and
he
intended
to
strike
from
the
jury
panel
any
person
who
indicated
whether
or
not
they...
whether
they
knew
mr.
porter,
who
was
my
co-counsel
at
the
time,
and
that
was...
i
asked
the
question,
did
not
that
person
that
you
excluded
admit
that
she
would
be
fair,
not
influenced
by
senator
porter
and
so
forth,
and
the
answer
was
yes.
that
brings
us,
i
think,
to
the
question
that
justice
blackmun
asked
regarding
the
clear
break.
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
in
my
review
of
discrimination
cases
the
only
persons
who
have
ever
been
afforded
a
presumption
of
validity
on
their
conduct
has
been
attorneys.
i
think
the
court
offered
to
prosecutors
both
of
the
united
states
government
and
of
the
state
court
that
they,
being
lawyers,
and
being
sworn
to
uphold
the
constitution,
would
not
employ
their
peremptory
challenges
in
a
manner
that
was
different
that
that
which
was
set
out
in
swain
versus
alabama.
that
is
that
any
peremptory
challenge
would
be
directed
to
matters
related
to
trial
as
opposed
to
race.
and
i
think
that
is
a
distinction
in
this
case
that
takes
it
out
of
the
ambit
of
the
rest
of
the
retroactivity
cases.
i
would
note
in
many
of
these
retroactivity
cases
the
good
faith
of
the
persons
involved
comes
to
mind,
particularly
in
united
states
against
peltier
or
peltier.
the
fact
that
the
law
may
have
not
been...
may
have
been
overruled
and
alameda
sanchez
may
not
have
been
the
proper
law,
people
relied
upon
this
law
in
good
faith.
i
think
what
batson
recognizes
is
that
in
swain
versus
alabama
the
court
recognized,
the
lawyers,
people
who
are
sworn,
and
i
don't
mean
to
be
melodramatic,
to
uphold
the
constitution
would
in
fact
act
in
conformance
with
their
oath.
after
20
years
or
21
years
of
the
evolution
of
trials,
i
think
the
court
in
batson
realized
that
perhaps
this
is
not
the
case
in
certain
circumstances.
the
court
in
batson
just
said,
if
the
appearance
is
there,
we
are
not
saying
grant
a
new
trial,
we
are
not
saying
to
anyone
that
you
have
to
indulge
in
all
these
acts.
what
we
are
saying
is,
if
the
appearance
of
impropriety
is
there
by
articulable
reasons
offered
by
the
defense
counsel
which
the
trial
judge
as
the
listener
to
voir
dire
can
take
unto
himself,
then
he
can
request
that
the
prosecutor
offer
a
neutral
basis
or
a
monochromatic
basis
for
the
exercise
of
his
challenges.
i
think
that
was
a
decision
that
surely
ought
to
have
effect
to
cases
pending
on
direct
appeal.
i
don't
think,
it
was...
granted,
it
was
a
break
in
the
rules,
it
was
a
clear
break
more
than
likely,
but
i
think
it
was
bottomed
on
a
conception
that
that
which
should
be
right
would
have
been
done,
and
i
think
the
facts
in
the
case
before
the
court
in
brown
illustrate
that
at
least
in
times
it
has
not
been
done.
the
arguments
in
support
of
retroactivity
as
in
the
harlan
approach
have
been
offered
to
the
court
already.
i
don't
want
to
repeat
them
and
just
unduly
talk
too
much,
but
they
have
been
set
forth,
and
i
think
and
i
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
the
harlan
approach
is
the
approach
that
ought
to
be
taken
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
in
shea,
and
just
draw
a
bright
line
and
say,
cases
pending
on
direct
appeal
receive
the
benefit
of
the
case...
of
the
law
at
the
time
the
case
is
decided.
mr.
fred
haddad
i
understand
that,
your
honor.
i
would
think
that,
as
justice
harlan
said,
taking
the
scope
of
the
great
writ,
as
he
called
it,
it
is
to
determine
if
a
person
is
lawfully
in
custody
by
those
factors
or
those
rules
in
effect
at
the
time
conviction
became
final,
with
certain
limited
exceptions.
one
would
think
of
matters
that
go
to
jurisdiction,
double
jeopardy
or
as
the
court
has
applied
gideon
versus
wainwright
and
those
cases.
mr.
fred
haddad
for
a
writ?
mr.
fred
haddad
waller
versus...
robinson
versus
neil
held...
it
wasn't
waller,
and
i
am
just
trying
to
give
the
court
an
example.
if
a
person...
i
don't
think
we
have
that
any
more
after
waller
and
ash
versus
swenson,
but
trying
to
give
the
court
an
idea
of
what...
a
response
to
your
question.
mr.
fred
haddad
yes,
sir.
i
agree,
but
i
am
just
trying
to
give
it
as
an
example
of
what
i
am
talking
about.
when
you
are
talking
about--
mr.
fred
haddad
--it
is
just
that
that
is
the
example
that
i
think
i
could
give,
where
it
went
to
the
essence
of
the
truthfinding
factor
on
collateral
review
or
something
where
the
court
has
previously
held
that
it
was
of
such
a
critical
nature
that
it
ought
to
be
applied
retroactively
on
collateral
review.
mr.
fred
haddad
i
would
think
so.
yes,
sir,
i
would
think
it
would
be
a
failure
to
follow
the
law
in
existence
at
the
time.
it
would
be...
and
i
hope,
mr.
chief
justice,
this
isn't
a
bad
example
again,
but
i
would
think
it
would
be
in
the
nature
of
a
failure
to
afford
a
full
and
fair
hearing
under
stone
versus
powell
and
the
fourth
amendment
issue.
mr.
fred
haddad
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
i
do,
so
that
i
just
say
that
in
conformance
and
conjunction
with...
yes,
sir?
mr.
fred
haddad
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
haddad
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
haddad
do
i
still
think
it
is
still
law?
mr.
fred
haddad
i
think
the
court
has
gotten
away
from
that.
i
think
justice
harlan,
and
i
hope
the
macke
decision
came
afterwards,
said
that
those
cases
came
along
because
of
this
court's
many--
mr.
fred
haddad
--i
am
sorry?
this
court's
decisions--
mr.
fred
haddad
--i
am
sorry.
i
meant
dissenting
opinion
in
macke
or
concurring
opinion
in
macke
dissenting
and
the
cases
with
it
noted,
i
believe,
that
this
court
had
taken
this
almost
as
a
policy
approach
because
of
its
numerous
decisions
in
the
criminal
law
field,
and
that
the
court
was
taking
certain
cases
and
holding
them
one
way
on
collateral
and
one
way
on
direct
and
then
not
of
benefit
to
anybody,
as
in
morrissey
versus
brewer,
or
certain
chance
beneficiaries,
and
that
is
what
brought
about
his
decision,
i
think,
or
his
opinion.
mr.
fred
haddad
yes,
sir.
mr.
fred
haddad
i
think
justice
brennan
wrote
that,
too.
mr.
fred
haddad
i
think
your
honor
wrote
that,
too,
as
i
recall.
mr.
fred
haddad
i
understand
that
justice--
mr.
fred
haddad
--i
think
there
has
been
a
break
away
from
that
with
johnson
and
shea.
let
me
say
that.
i
think
there
has
been
a
trend
away
from
it
with
johnson
and
shea.
mr.
fred
haddad
it
certainly
would,
sir,
yes.
i
don't
deny
that.
if
i
may,
if
i
have
any
other
time
left,
i
would
like
to
reserve
it.
thank
you
very
much.
mr.
fred
haddad
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
