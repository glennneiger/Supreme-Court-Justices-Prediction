mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
the
21
years
and
four
months
since
linkletter
that
mr.
aprile
referred
to,
there
have
been
in
our
opinion
or
in
our
view
two
bodies
or
two
schools
of
law
that
you
have
handed
down
with
regard
to
the
question,
the
very
narrow
question,
of
the
retroactive
application
to
cases
on
direct
appeal.
and
we
feel
under
either
school
of
law
or
either
body
of
thought
the
rule
that
you
have
handed
down,
the
new
rule
of
constitutional
criminal
procedure
of
april
the
30th
of
this
year
in
batson
versus
kentucky,
requires
prospective
application
only.
in
the
first
instance,
batson
was
a
clear
break
case.
it
was
a
classic
clear
break
case.
obviously,
on
this
point
petitioner
and
respondent
disagree.
the
1982
case
of
united
states
versus
johnson
set
out
the
standard
test
for
clear
break
cases,
and
in
effect
you
said
that
if
there
was
a
clear
break
case
prospectivity
is
preordained.
batson
meets
two
of
the
three
criteria:
it
explicitly
overruled
a
past
precedent;
that
being
swain
versus
alabama;
and
it
disapproved
a
practice
which
this
court
arguably
has
sanctioned
in
the
past.
batson,
we
make
this
claim
that
it
was
a
clear
break
because
not
only
are
there
some
similarities
between
swain
and
batson
if
you
put
them
side
by
side,
especially
with
regard
to
the
dictates
of
this
court
in
the
area
of
equal
protection,
but
more
importantly
where
we
come
with
the
clear
break
argument
is
that
you
effectively
changed
the
nature
of
peremptory
challenges,
especially
the
use
and
purpose
to
which
prosecutors
or
any
litigant
could
avail
himself
in
this
particular
case
to
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges
in
a
particular
case.
this
court
specifically
stated
that,
to
the
extent
that
swain
is
inconsistent,
it
is
overruled.
thus,
we
feel
the
argument
can
be
made
that
batson
was
precisely
the
type
of
clear
break--
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
i
believe
it
is
in
a
footnote,
your
honor.
but
again,
when
you
look
at
the
language
in
swain,
justice
white
went
into
great
detail
about
the
history
and
the
system
of
peremptory
challenges,
that
they
would
not
be...
that
the
use
of
a
peremptory
challenge
to
strike
a
black
individual
in
a
particular
case
is
not
a
denial
of
equal
protection.
batson,
20
years
later,
said
it
was,
and
that
all
of
a
sudden
the
unfettered,
unchallenged
right
of
a
prosecutor
to
use
a
peremptory
challenge,
as
handed
down
and
as
dictated
by
swain,
completely
changed
180
degrees
on
april
the
30th
of
this
year,
when
now
hearings
have
been
indicated,
reasons
have
to
be
propounded
in
order
to
justify
such
a
use
of
a
peremptory
challenge.
so
we
believe
that
classically
this
was
a
clear
break
case.
thirdly,
as
mr.
aprile
referred
to,
under
allen
versus
hardy,
two
months
to
the
day
after
batson,
this
court
said
batson
was
an
explicit
and
substantial
break
with
prior
precedent.
now,
obviously
you
did
not
use
the
words
or
the
magic
words
it
was
a
clear
break.
but
i
would
submit
that
it's
a
very
fine
line
between
a
clear
break
and
an
explicit
and
substantial
break.
again,
the
third
point
being
that
batson
was
a
clear
break
and
deserves
prospective
application
only.
as
one
attempts
to
study
this
body
of
law,
an
issue
or
an
element
that
consistently
comes
up
is
the
question
of
whether
or
not
it
was
foreshadowed.
was
batson,
was
the
demise
of
swain
foreshadowed?
it's
interesting,
i
think,
to
point
out
that
not
even
batson
himself
attacked
swain
as
the
basis
for
overturning
his
particular
conviction
or
the
error
that
he
raised
in
his
particular
case.
no
case
on
the
basis
of
federal
law
claimed
that
swain
no
longer
controlled.
in
the
states...
there
are
two
states
you
asked
about
the
effect,
i
believe,
justice
blackmunn,
that
this
might
have.
there
are
48
states
similarly
situated
who
rest
on
your
decision
on
the
retroactivity
question
of
griffith
and
batson.
the
two
states
that
went
their
own
way,
if
you
will,
cited
the
continued
vitality
of
swain
and
the
continued
application,
and
grounded
their
new
approach
on
reasons
particular
to
their
own
particular
state
constitution.
the
fact
that
swain
was
criticized--
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
--no,
justice
stevens.
massachusetts
and
california
are
the
two
that
have
gone
their
own
way,
so
they
have...
and
they
founded
that
on
reasons
of
their
own
constitution
and
they
founded
in
on
fair
cross-section
and
impartiality
grounds.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
no.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
exactly.
the
point
being
that
swain
wasn't
foreshadowed,
and
everybody
up
until
april
the
30th
of
this
year,
every
state
and
every
federal,
every
trial
and
every
appellate
court
in
this
country,
recognized
swain
to
be
the
law
and
the
tenets
of
swain
to
be
the
law.
so
again,
the
argument
that
i'm
trying
to
proffer
to
the
court
is
that
when
batson
came
out
it
was
a
clear
break
and
a
dramatic
clear
break.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
i
do
not
believe
that
it
does.
and
with
all
due
respect
to
justices
brennan
and
marshall,
who
indicated
their
concern
and
who
perhaps
foreordained
the
demise
of
swain,
that
is
not
enough,
because
up
until
actual
precedent
is
overruled
the
authorities
have
every
reason
to
rely
upon
that.
and
i
think
the
dissent
in
the
mccray
case--
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
--that
i'm
not
familiar
with,
your
honor.
even
should
a
prosecutor
have
had
reason
to
think
that
swain
was
foreshadowed,
there
was
no
standard
upon
which
he
could
rely
in
attempting
to
anticipate
what
this
court
would
require
concerning
the
eventual
demise
of
the
swain
decision.
we
believe
for
those
reasons
or
for
these
reasons
just
articulated
that
again,
that
we
think
it's
without
question
that
batson
was
a
clear
break
case
and
is
entitled
to
prospective
application
only.
but
if,
for
whatever
reason,
this
court
does
not
feel
that
batson
was
a
clear
break,
then
i
would
submit
to
you
the
traditional
development
of
precedent
that
this
court
has
handed
down
under
stovall
and
we
believe
under
that
test
as
well
batson
requires
prospective
application.
that
test
can
be
broken
down,
obviously,
as
questions
have
already
been
directed,
to
purpose,
reliance,
and
effect.
and
as
also
some
of
the
questioning
has
gone
this
afternoon,
those
cases
which
indicate
that
if
it's
an
impact
on
truth-finding
then
retroactivity
is
called
for,
but
if
not
then
prospectivity
is
the
order
of
the
day.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
exactly,
your
honor,
justice
marshall.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
no,
but
i
mean--
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
--exactly,
and
it
proves
a
point
of
reliance,
that
no
court
wished
to
go
beyond
the
tenets
of
this
court
in
what
you
said
in
swain
up
until
april
the
30th.
and
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
in
this
particular
case
was
the
same
prosecutor
in
the
batson
case
i
think
is
of
no
moment,
because
in
theory
it
could
have
come
from
the
same
prosecutor's
office.
we
have
a
lot
of
one-man
prosecutor's
offices
in
kentucky,
and
it
could
have
come
from
that
jurisdiction
itself.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
but
it
didn't.
but
again,
that
prosecutor,
regardless
of
who
the
prosecutor
was,
was
still
entitled
to
rely
upon
what
the
court
said
in
swain,
unchallenged,
unfettered
use
of
peremptory
challenges,
for
whatever
reason,
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
i
hired
that
prosecutor.
i
was
the
district
attorney
in
louisville
at
the
time.
mr.
paul
w.
richwalsky,
jr.
no,
i
do
not
believe
that
he
was.
under
the
traditional
retroactivity
principles
when
we
get
to
purpose
and
the
reason,
if
it
can
be
anticipated
why
this
court
handed
down
the
batson
decision,
i
would
make
the
analogy
to
what
this
court
has
said
in
the
fourth
amendment
type
of
cases
and
the
development
in
that
area.
you
saw
a
wrong
that
after
20
years
you
decide
to
address
specifically
in
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges.
all
the
earlier
cases
talk
about
the
governmental
action
in
discrimination
with
regard
to
the
venire,
with
regard
to
jury
service,
with
regard
to
actual
participation
on
petit
juries.
and
now
finally
again,
why
batson
was
such
a
clean
break
is
you
address
the
right
of
a
litigant,
the
right
of
the
government,
to
use
that
peremptory
challenge.
and
in
effect
what
we
hear
you
say
is:
trial
courts,
prosecutors,
we're
going
to
change
the
rules,
we're
going
to
change
the
rules
with
regard
to
the
use
of
peremptory
challenges,
and
in
the
future
go
out
and,
if
you
will,
sin
no
more;
go
out
and
follow
our
dictates
in
the
future,
just
like
you
told
the
police
officers
in
the
sixties
and
in
the
seventies
when
a
new
embodiment
of
search
and
seizure
law
was
handed
down.
it
didn't
affect...
it
wasn't
retroactive
to
everybody
else
that
was
waiting
in
the
wings,
but
you
said,
in
the
future
go
out
and
make
this
correction.
we
feel
that
was
the
purpose
of
the
swain...
or
the
batson
decision.
the
truth-finding,
again
citing
this
court
in
allen
versus
hardy,
in
june
of
this
year
you
said
there
may
be,
or
that
batson
may
have
some
impact
on
truth-finding.
but
you
went
on
to
say,
as
we
believe
and
as
we
heard
you,
that
this
wasn't
the
sole
purpose,
and
you
talked
about
to
ensure
that
the
government
does
not
discriminate
against
citizens
who
are
called
for
jury
service
and
to
strengthen
public
confidence
in
our
administration.
so
the
rule
in
batson
we
submit
serves
multiple
ends,
and
only
the
first
of
which
may
have
some
impact
on
truth-finding.
your
cases,
your
decisions,
have
held
that
the
impairment
to
truth-finding
must
be
substantial
and
not
merely
incidental
in
order
to
be
considered
for
retroactive
application.
the
other
tests
under
the
traditional
rules
of
reliance
and
effect
i
think
that
we
have
attempted
to
cover,
that
the
reliance
was
universally
viewed
and
upheld.
it's
been
great
by
every
court.
and
again,
the
thing
to
keep
in
mind,
we
would
submit,
is
when
you
address
us
on
this
particular
point
you're
not
just
talking
to
prosecutors;
you're
talking
to
trial
and
appellate
courts,
too,
who
took
you
at
your
word
in
swain
and
what
you
held,
and
the
reluctance
that
any
of
those
courts
had
to
overturn
you
until
april
the
30th.
the
effect,
we
think,
would
be
significant.
it's
impossible,
very
difficult
to
know
how
many
cases
are
involved
out
there.
i
agree
with
mr.
aprile
that
the
reduction...
or
your
language
in
allen
versus
hardy
with
regard
to
the
collateral
matters,
that
effectively
removed
many
from
consideration.
but
we
still
feel
that
the
numbers
are
significant,
and
the
difficulties
and
the
burden
on
the
courts
that
would
be
called
into
play
should
you
hold
batson
retroactive
we
would
submit
to
you
calls
for
prospective
relief
only.
so
again,
under
either
embodiment
of
law
and
principle
as
we
interpret
your
decisions
of
the
past
21
years,
under
the
clear
break
test
or
under
the
traditional
test,
either
application
we
feel
calls
for
the
prospective
relief
only
of
batson
versus
kentucky.
i'd
be
happy
to
attempt
to
answer
any
questions
should
the
court
have
any.
