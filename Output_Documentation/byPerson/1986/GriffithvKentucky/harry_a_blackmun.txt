what
is
the
justification
for
the
exception
having
to
do
with
a
clear
break
in
the
past?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
confining
it
to
cases
on
direct
review,
what
is
the
justification
for
the
exception?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
on
that
justification,
then
the
case
that
is
taken
should
be
made
prospective
only
and
not
affect
that
individual?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
but
i'm
groping
for
the
justification
and
i
haven't
really
seen
very
much
yet.
i'm
not
blaming
you
for
it.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no,
i'm
not
blaming
you.
you're
doing
the
best
you
can
to
justify
the
rule.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
wouldn't
mind
doing
away
with
the
exception,
i
take
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--mr.
aprile,
how
widespread
is
this
random
selection
business
that
you
have?
it's
not
in
effect
in
most
states,
i
think.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
know,
that's
the
cleaner
way
of
handling
it.
you
don't
have
to
explain.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
in
a
footnote,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
that's
of
no
significance,
but
it's
in
a
footnote.
