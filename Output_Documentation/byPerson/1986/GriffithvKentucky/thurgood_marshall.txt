marshall
and
it
was
only
one
month
between
the
convictions.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
your
kentucky
courts
didn't
discuss
any
of
that.
they
just
said
swain
is
it.
that's
all
it
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
the
rest
of
that
is
not
in
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
we've
got
in
this
case
is
a
prosecutor
who
was
the
same
prosecutor
in
the
batson
case,
swain
is
it,
and
the
supreme
court
of
kentucky
said,
we
agree,
swain
is
it,
period.
that's
this
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
think
that
that
prosecutor
was
prejudiced?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
read
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
ask
you
to
take
the
blame
for
it.
i
asked
you
to
admit
it,
to
admit
the
truth.
