mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
of
griffith
versus
kentucky
presents
a
single
issue,
and
that
is
in
cases
pending
on
direct
appeal
should
the
holding
in
batson
versus
kentucky
be
given
retroactive
effect.
as
a
result
of
this
court's
holding
in
allen
versus
hardy,
there
is
no
question
before
this
court
that
batson
will
not
be
given
retroactive
effect
in
cases
that
were
final
when
batson
was
decided.
you
have
ruled
batson
will
not
apply
retroactively
to
those
cases.
so
it
is
in
this
context
that
griffith
versus
kentucky
and
the
following
case,
brown
versus
united
states,
present
you
the
opportunity
to
take
one
step
further
than
you
did
in
shea
versus
louisiana
and
embrace
the
rule
that
you
had
prior
to
linkletter
versus
walker,
and
that
is
that
you
would
return
to
decision
that
holds
that
all
constitutional
rules
that
are
announced
will
be
applied
retroactively
to
all
cases
on
direct
appeal.
you
have
had
21
years
of
experimentation
since
linkletter
versus
walker
and,
as
many
of
you
have
expressed
in
various
opinions
and
past
members
of
the
court
have
indicated,
the
difficulty
with
retroactivity
that
has
been
generated
by
the
attempt
to
draw
bright
lines,
particularly
in
the
area
of
the
question
of
direct
review.
we
would
submit
that
the
easiest
solution
and
perhaps
one
that
would
accommodate
factors
you
have
utilized
in
other
contexts
would
be
to
go
back
to
the
pre-linkletter
versus
walker
situation
and,
even
though
not
constitutionally
mandated,
embrace
the
concept
that
those
cases
that
have
raised
the
same
issue
that
are
not
final
would
be
entitled
to
the
benefit
of
the
new
constitutional
principle
announced.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
your
honor,
it
is
obvious
from
the
context
of
the
situation
we
are
put
in
by
the
ruling
in
allen
versus
hardy
that
takes
away
the
question
of
collateral
relief
in
the
batson
case,
i
am
obviously
not
in
a
position
to
strongly
advocate,
as
someone
who
has
a
client
who's
involved
in
that
situation,
for
the
adoption
of
the
second
part
of
justice
harlan's
approach.
but
i
do
feel
that
you
have
ideally
set
the
situation
and
the
table
here
to
embrace
it
in
the
context
of
batson.
i
think
it's
very
interesting
that
if
we
look
at
what
you
decided
in
shea
versus
louisiana,
in
the
footnote
you
pointed
out
that
cases
such
as
brown
versus
the
united
states
and
griffith
versus
kentucky
were
not
even
decided
on
the
basis
of
shea
versus
louisiana.
but
those
cases
that
were
pending
in
this
court
on
writ
of
certiorari
when
edwards
versus
united
states
came
down
were
granted
automatic
remands.
they
were
given
retroactive
application.
and
in
your
most
recent
case,
shea
versus
louisiana,
you
only
addressed
the
question
of
those
that
were
really
on
direct
review
in
state
and
federal
courts
and
not
pending
before
this
court.
it's
very
difficult
to
say
that
there
has
been
a
good
strong
rationale
for
applying
the
different
doctrines
of
retroactivity
in
cases
on
direct
appeal.
if
i
could
perhaps
subvert
for
a
second,
the
two
concepts
that
you've
often
used
in
the
context
of
retroactivity,
reliance
and
effect
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice.
i
submit
to
you
that
as
you
decide
a
case
and
announce
a
new
constitutional
rule
and
allow
the
question
of
retroactivity
on
direct
appeal
to
swing
and
sway
in
the
breeze,
the
lower
courts
then
go
on
and
make
their
decisions.
some
will
opt
that
the
decision
will
be
retroactive,
some
will
opt
that
it
will
not
be
retroactive.
that
generates
much
litigation
by
people
on
both
sides
of
this
podium,
because
if
we
lose
we're
going
to
come
to
you
on
petition
for
cert
and
ask
that
you
hold
that
the
case
be
retroactively
applied.
if
it
goes
the
other
way,
they
will
come
and
ask
the
opposite.
so
as
far
as
impact
on
the
administration
of
criminal
justice
and
reliance
by
the
courts
below,
it
would
seem
that
a
rule
that
went
back
to
pre-linkletter
and
said
there
will
be
a
presumption
that
when
the
case
is
on
direct
review,
it
is
not
final,
it
will
get
the
benefit
of
the
constitutional
ruling.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
i
may
be
wrong
in
this,
but
it
was
my
basic
understanding
that
in
that
regard,
in
that
mode,
that
they
oftentimes
were
granted
complete
retroactivity.
i
have
no
quibble
with
the
need
in
instances
in
dealing
with
full
and
complete
retroactivity
focusing
on
final
decisions
that
perhaps
it
would
be
good
for
you
to
utilize
tests
such
as
the
reliance
and
impact.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
again,
your
honor,
obviously
there
are
arguments
that
could
be
made
for
that
purpose.
i
think
that
some
of
the
exceptions
that
you
have
carved
out
on
both
sides
of
the
scale
would
have
application
there.
for
example,
when
a
case...
when
a
decision
announced
by
this
court
significantly
impacts
on
the
truth-finding
process,
it
may
very
well
be
that
that
is
the
type
of
exception
that
you
will
provide
full
retroactive
relief
on
collateral
situations.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
i
think
that
we
can
look
at
that
in
two
ways.
i
think
that
the
particular
case
that
you
have
before
you
today
is
different
from
many
of
the
cases
that
you
have
decided
retroactivity
on.
number
one,
the
relief
that
you
gave
in
batson
was
not
to
reverse
and
grant
a
new
trial,
but
it
was
remanded
for
a
simple
inquiry,
an
inquiry
that
involves,
first
of
all,
determining
whether
or
not,
usually
from
official
court
records,
blacks
were
struck
by
the
prosecutor
in
a
large
number;
secondly,
if
that
were
true,
the
defendant
showing
he
was
a
member
of
a
cognizable
racial
groups;
and
then
putting
the
prosecutor
to
the
test
of
stating
trial-related
reasons
why
he
made
those
strikes
as
opposed
to
racially
biased
reasons;
and
the
court
then
deciding
whether
or
not
the
prosecutor
had
overcome
a
prima
facie
showing
of
discrimination
made,
as
you
pointed
out,
could
be
now
made
under
batson.
what
reliance
was
there
in
the
past?
the
reliance
not
to
hold
a
hearing
is
all
that
we
had.
as
members
of
this
court
pointed
out
in
the
batson
decision,
certainly
no
prosecutor
should
have
believed
that
he
had
the
right
to
rely
on
swain
for
the
proposition
that
he
could
challenge
people,
blacks
and
other
minorities,
on
the
basis
of
race
with
no
trial-related
basis.
the
only
thing
he
had
a
right
to
rely
on
was
that
the
courts
probably
were
not
going
to
utilize
the
evolving
equal
protection
test
in
other
contexts
to
require
that
the
prosecutor
respond
to
an
allegation
of
racial
prejudice
in
the
context
of
one
limited
case.
any
prosecutor
who
had
read
even
swain
would
have
thought
to
know
that
when
this
challenge
was
raised
against
him,
the
possibility
that
later
he
would
be
called
on
the
carpet
for
his
conduct
in
many
cases
and
would
have
kept
some
sort
of
trial
notebook,
some
sort
of
file,
that
would
have
allowed
him
to
respond
in
these
situations.
as
this
court
stated
in
solem
versus
stumes,
unjustified
reliance
is
no
reliance
at
all.
now,
if
there
is
a
price
to
be
paid
by
conducting
hearings
after
the
fact
on
this
limited
issue,
it
is
certainly
a
price
that
we
should
pay
for
guaranteeing
the
right
of
participation
of
blacks
in
our
jury
system
and
secondly
the
right
of
a
defendant
not
to
have
excluded
from
his
particular
jury
people
of
his
same
race
simply
because
the
prosecution
has
a
racially
biased
motive
for
excluding
them.
so
i
think
when
we
look
at
reliance,
it's
certainly...
if
you
want
to
go
back
to
the
other
standards
and
tests
that
this
court
has
utilized
in
dealing
with
retroactivity,
this
client,
this
petitioner,
mr.
griffith,
is
not
afraid
to
be
judged
under
those
standards.
as
we
pointed
out
in
the
brief,
we
think
we
succeed.
we
do
not
think
that
this
case
is
a
clear
break
that
mandates
retroactivity.
you
have
said
in
the
context
of
allen
versus
hardy
that
it
is
an
explicit
and
substantial
break.
but
indeed,
in
allen
versus
hardy
you
did
not
stop
there.
this
court
did
not
say
this
is
an
explicit...
this
is
not
a
clearcut
break.
you
did
not
use
the
magic
language,
so
to
speak.
i
find
that
not
to
be
a
conclusion
of
law
finding
by
this
court.
but
secondly,
you
went
on
and
went
through
the
reliance
and
the
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice
analysis
for
collateral
review.
i
think
by
the
very
nature
of
the
steps
taken
by
this
court,
it
was
clear
that
the
majority
opinion
did
not
embrace
the
concept
that
this
was
a
clear
break
in
the
law.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
in
all
fairness...
and
it's
very
difficult
for
me
to
anchor
in,
but
i
certainly
can
refer
to
other
cases
where
in
the
course
of
this
21
years
this
court
has
looked
at
things
and
said,
if
it
is
a
clear
break
in
the
law,
non-retroactivity
will
be
mandated.
there
are
a
number
of
cases
in
the
last
21
years
where
this
court--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
--well,
i
would
beg
to
differ
with
you
in
this
regard,
that
if
you
look
at
a
number
of
the
retroactivity
cases
over
that
period
of
time
there
has
often
been
the
statement
made
that
this
court
sees
no
distinction
in
this
case
between
full
and
complete
retroactivity
or
limited
retroactivity
to
those
cases
on
direct
review.
i
would
hope,
and
i
would
like
to
agree
with
you,
that
if
the
decision
in
solem
versus
stumes
and
shea
versus
louisiana
create
two
different
standards
and
embraces
johnson
from
the
fourth
amendment
and
says,
from
now
on
on
direct
review
this
is
what
we
do,
if
shea
versus
louisiana
is
the
controlling
precept,
then
i
have
no
trouble
accepting
that
and
saying,
fine.
then
we
will
put
aside
that
finding
in
allen
versus
hardy,
as
you
wish
to
do,
and
say
that
you
didn't
have
to
reach
that
question
because
you
used
a
different
test
of
retroactivity
on
collateral
review.
i'm
willing
to
accept
that,
because
i
think
if
we
use
shea
versus
louisiana's
test
we
are
in
much
the
same
situation
as
petitioner
shea
was
in,
because
again,
while
there
was
a
change
of
rules,
there
was
no
clearcut
break
in
precedent.
and
in
that
situation,
what
you
did
in
shea
versus
louisiana
was
to
look
at
the
harlan
approach.
and
when
you
looked
at
the
harlan
approach,
what
did
you
say?
you
said,
if
we
utilize
application
of
retroactivity
of
the
edwards
decision
to
cases
on
direct
review,
we
will
provide
fairness
to
each
litigant
that
was
before
the
court
on
direct
review,
because
each
of
them
will
be
judged
on
the
merits
of
their
own
case,
not
on
the
chance
that
their
case
was
not
the
one
selected
to
be
the
one
in
which
you
announced
the
rule.
it's
ironic
that
i
stand
before
you
today
asking
for
equal
treatment
for
griffith
in
this
case,
when
his
substantive
complaint
is
that
he
was
denied
equal
protection
by
the
action
of
the
prosecutor
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
ironic
that
i
stand
before
you
today
and
ask
that
you
give
him
retroactive
relief
on
direct
review
because
of
the
chances
that
were
involved.
the
same
prosecutor
that
utilized
his
peremptory
strikes
in
the
way
that
he
did
in
batson
versus
kentucky
is
the
same
prosecutor
in
this
case.
it
occurred
in
the
same
circuit
court.
the
only
difference
is
the
division
and
some
difference
in
time.
as
this
court
has
frequently
pointed
out,
litigants
such
as
mr.
griffith
usually
have
no
control
over
the
speed
at
which
their
case
reaches
this
court,
and
it
was
only
chance--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
--that's
right,
your
honor.
and
it
is
very,
very
difficulty
to
go
back
and
say,
for
purposes
of
your
equal
protection
claim,
yours
cannot
be
considered
because
yours
was
not
the
one
selected
at
random.
that
was
justice
harlan's
entire
point
in
looking
particularly
at
direct
review.
how
can
we
justify
as
a
system
of
law
built
on
precedent
giving
only
prospective
application,
with
one
exception,
and
that
is
to
the
case
which
you
select
for
the
particular
purpose
of
announcing
a
rule?
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
really
believe
that
the
clear
break
rule
is
justified
under
the
test
of
reliance
and
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
when
you
carry
it
all
the
way
out
through
the
full
and
complete
retroactivity
that
embraces
not
only
those
cases
on
direct
review,
but
those
cases
which
would
be...
that
have
already
become
final
and
would
be
able
to
get
relief
only
through
collateral
action.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
the
justification
would
be
very
simply
that
the
people
that
administer
whatever
the
particular
rule
was,
in
this
case
prosecutors
and
trial
judges,
would
have
the
right
to
rely
on
an
existing
precedent
that
so
clearly
spells
out
what
their
conduct
should
be.
i
find
it
very
interesting
that
both
the
state
of
kentucky
and
the
united
states
government
in
brown
versus
united
states
take
the
position
that
there
are
so
many
people
that
would
be
affected
by
this
on
direct,
if
you
granted
retroactivity
on
direct
review.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
your
honor,
i
certainly,
as
a
person
who
represents
individuals
before
a
court,
would
hate
to
see
that
this
court
would
embrace
as
a
general
rule
only
prospective
application
of
decisions.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
apologize
for
that.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
think
that
your
question
does
introduce
a
factor.
maybe
i
misunderstood
your
question.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
no.
in
fact,
i
feel
that,
as
was
pointed
out
in
the
dissent
in
shea
versus
louisiana,
the
position
you
took
in
shea
versus
louisiana
simply
doesn't
clarify
the
problem
because
we
still
have
all
the
courts
below
you
speculating
on
what
is
a
clear
break
in
the
law.
i
think
that
if
you
were
asking...
and
perhaps
i'm--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
--well,
i
think
that
confusion
is
acceptable
for
the
purpose
that
other
people,
justices
on
this
court,
have
spoken
to
that
issue
in
various
contexts,
both
in
dissents
and
in
majority
opinions,
and
have
pointed
out
that
there
is
some
reason
for
embracing
a
line
that
is
based
on
finality.
it's
true
in
this
case
that
finality,
being
that
the
time
for
petitioning
the
case
to
this
court
for
certiorari
had
elapsed,
in
that
situation
then
we
move
over
and
talk
about
the
question
of
clear
break.
yes,
it
will
still
work
unequal
application
of
the
law
in
certain
situations,
and
perhaps
some
of
the
exceptions
that
you
have
carved
out
in
collateral
review,
such
as
impact
on
the
truth-finding
process,
would
help
to
make
sure
that
that
type
of
unequal
application
would
not
fall
in
situations
such
as
where
you
dealt
with
in
hankerson
versus
north
carolina,
the
retroactivity
of
the--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
--i
feel
at
a
real
loss
to
urge
that
position
before
this
court
today.
this
court
by
its
action
in
allen
versus
hardy
took
that
issue
away
in
the
context
of
batson.
it's
very
difficult
for
someone
in
my
position
to
become
an
advocate
for
a
rule
that
has
no
impact
on
his
client
or
the
class
of
client
that
he
would
represent.
i
am
not
in
a
position...
certainly
i
could
say,
yes,
your
honor,
i
want
you
to
embrace
that
rule.
but
it
would
be
sort
of
hypocritical,
wouldn't
it,
under
the
circumstances?
i
am
not
representing
anybody
who
will
be
benefited
or
harmed
by
that
rule.
so
what
i
am
saying
is,
you
granted
the
writ
of
cert
under
these
circumstances
and
you
decided
that
batson
would
not
be
retroactive
in
allen
versus
hardy.
i
have
no
quibble
with
that,
but
it
puts
me
in
a
position
that
that
is
now
a
moot
question.
i
don't
think
i
am
the
person
to
advocate
with
an
interest
for
a
client
i
don't
have
in
that
situation.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
i
certainly
am.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
i
think
that
it
would
be--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
--i
think
that
basically
the
answer
to
this
is
simply
this,
that
under
justice
harlan's
view,
if
you
move
it
into
the
collateral
area,
he
would
have
a
general
principle
or
presumption
that
those
cases...
that
there
would
not
be
retroactive
application
to
cases
that
were
final,
but
he
would
leave
certain
exceptions.
i
am
not
here
to
say
that
is
a
good
rule
or
a
bad
rule.
it's
certainly
something
you
could
do.
i
wouldn't
imagine
you
would
do
it
in
the
context
of
this
case.
but
i
suspect
that
this
case
offers
you
the
ideal
opportunity
to
remove
one
aspect
of
this,
and
that
is
a
bright
line
for
direct
appeals.
in
a
following
case,
you
could
then
deal
with
those
cases
where
finality
is
involved,
knowing
that
you
had
carved
out
a
bright
line
in
this
situation.
i
think
it's
very
important
that
i
point
out
to
you
that
in
looking
at
allen
versus
hardy
i
was
concerned
about
the
question
of
whether
the
impact
of
the
process
that's
involved
here,
the
new
constitutional
rule
on
the
truth-finding
process.
i
think
that
my
case
and
mr.
brown's
case,
the
whole
batson
concept,
is
more
akin
to
the
decision
on
retroactivity
in
brown
versus
louisiana
applying
burch
louisiana,
and
i
think
it
for
this
reason.
if
we
look
at
what
happened
in
burch
versus
louisiana,
this
court
said
that
a
six
man
jury
had
to
be
unanimous,
and
when
it
was
a
vote
of
five
to
one
that
that
was
unconstitutional.
and
that
you
said
when
you
addressed
that
question
in
retroactivity
language
in
brown
versus
louisiana
was
how
this
impeded
and
impaired
the
truth-finding
function
of
a
trial.
and
although
it
may
not
be
immediately
apparent,
i
think
that
what
we
have
in
batson
is
a
very
similar
situation.
if
you
realize
under
the
facts
of
the
situation,
each
of
the
jurors
who
were
struck
by
the
prosecutor,
those
jurors
who
were
black,
under
the
rules
of
procedure
in
kentucky
had
survived
every
test
that
could
be
put
to
them.
there
was
only
one
way
that
they
would
not
serve
on
the
jury,
and
that
is
if
random
selection
eliminated
them.
in
many
ways,
they
were
like
the
sixth
juror
in
burch
versus
louisiana.
they
were
going
to
be
on
that
jury
but
for
one
of
two
things:
the
prosecutor's
improper
peremptory
challenge
or
random
selection.
so
in
fact,
they
were
pulled
away
at
the
very
last
minute
from
being
able
to
participate
in
that
jury,
in
much
the
same
way
the
louisiana
rule
nullified
the
one
vote
by
not
having
a
non-unanimous
verdict
when
you
had
a
six-man
jury.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
well,
your
honor,
i'm
not
really
in
a
position
to
say
that.
but
normally
i
would
say
this,
that
in
most
instances...
and
i've
only
tried
cases
in
the
military
and
in
kentucky,
to
be
quite
frank
with
you...
in
most
cases
i
would
feel
that
peremptory
challenges
would
only
be
exercised
once
you
had
reached
the
situation
that
people
had
gotten
through
all
challenges
for
cause.
and
whether
or
not
there
would
be
any
requirement
then
of
random
selection
or
they
would
have
just
come
up
with
the
number
to
try
the
case,
12,
13,
14,
depending
on
the
number
of
alternates,
the
point
is
still
the
same.
i
used
kentucky
because
that's
the
facts
of
the
case.
the
only
way
those
people
were
stopped
from
sitting
on
the
jury
if
there
was
no
random
selection
was
by
the
action
of
the
prosecutor.
and
he
effectively
deprived
the
defendants
in
those
cases--
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
--and
so
the
point
that
i'm
trying
to
make
here
is
very
simply
this:
you
looked
in
brown
versus
louisiana
and
said
the
integrity
of
the
fact-finding
process
was
so
affected
by
what
was
done
there,
and
that
was
done
by
a
racially
neutral
statute
or
rule.
it
didn't
know
which
juror
would
be
come
the
one
vote
who
didn't
get
counted,
who
didn't
have
to
be
there
for
a
unanimous
verdict.
but
here
we
have,
at
least
on
a
prima
facie
showing
we
will
have,
that
the
action
that
deprived
that
juror
of
participating
was
done
by
a
racially
motivated
action
by
a
state
employee,
a
prosecutor,
when
he
knew
under
the
statement
made
by
this
court
in
swain
versus
alabama
that
it
would
be
improper
to
do
that.
i
say
on
that
basis
we
make
a
very
strong
showing
that
what
occurred
in
batson
versus
kentucky,
the
rule
that
you
announced
there,
does
have
incredible
impact
on
the
truth-finding
function.
and
on
that
basis
alone,
we
should
be
entitled
to
retroactive
application
of
batson
to
cases
on
direct
review.
if
we
were
to
go
to
the
stovall
criteria,
the
linkletter
versus
walker
criteria,
i
believe
that
we
can
meet
that,
too.
i
believe
we
can
meet
that
for
showing
this:
number
one,
you
have
effectively
removed
a
large
number
of
cases
that
could
cause
impact
on
the
judicial
administrations
of
the
state
and
federal
courts
by
holding
in
allen
versus
hardy
that
this
will
not,
batson
will
not
have
collateral
retroactivity.
now
we
are
only
dealing
with
the
cases
that
are
on
direct
review.
it
stands
to
reason
that
the
relief
that
you
granted
in
batson
will
require
some
going
back,
some
jogging
of
old
memories
and
looking
at
court
records.
but
we
have
put
not
a
clear-cut,
finite
time
line
on
this,
but
we
know
that
most
of
the
cases
that
will
be
on
direct
review
will
be
those
within
a
reasonable
amount
of
time.
so
consequently,
it
doesn't
appear
that
there
will
be
a
large
number
of
cases,
nothing
like
there
would
have
been
had
you
granted
full
retroactive
application
of
batson,
particularly
to
those
cases
on
collateral
review.
and
secondly,
with
regard
to
reliance,
i
think
i've
addressed
that
already
by
discussing,
prosecutors
and
judges
really
didn't
have
a
right
to
rely
on
swain
if
it
was
to
say
prosecutors
had
the
right
to
hide
behind
swain
in
makin
peremptory
challenges
based
solely
on
race
and
not
on
trial-related
conditions.
if
there
are
no
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
vincent
aprile,
ii
thank
you,
your
honor.
i
would
like
to
begin
by
addressing
the
statement
that
was
made
by
the
attorney
general,
that
being
that
only
two
states
have
dealt
with
this
issue.
in
pages
34
and
35
of
the
brief
for
the
petitioner,
we
point
out
a
large
number
of
states
that
have
dealt
with
this
particular
question
under
their
state
constitutions
or
federal
courts
which
have
dealt
with
it
under
their
supervisory
power
or,
like
the
sixth
circuit
and
the
second
circuit,
dealing
with
it
under
a
sixth
amendment
analysis.
all
of
those
particular
analyses
would
reduce
the
number
of
cases
that
direct...
retroactivity
on
direct
review
would
approach.
for
example,
the
attorney
general
tells
us
that
only,
i
believe
it
was,
california
and
massachusetts
had
addressed
this
under
their
state
constitution.
new
jersey
and
florida
have
both
addressed
it
and,
for
example,
florida
held
under
their
state
constitution
this
type
of
situation
to
require
retroactive
relief
to
all
cases
on
direct
review.
but
i
won't
burden
you
any
longer
with
that,
only
to
state
that
it
substantially
reduces
the
number
of
cases
that
would
be
affected
by
a
grant
of
direct
review
retroactivity,
because
a
lot
of
these
cases
have
been
decided
in
the
state
courts
on
different
grounds
and
accomplished
the
same
purpose.
so
they
would
not...
this
would
not
be
a
problem
for
many
of
those
states.
it
seems
to
me
as
the
proponent
that
if
there
will
be
a
large
impact
on
the
administration
of
justice
it
is
the
obligation
of
the
attorney
general
representing
kentucky
to
come
forward
and
demonstrate
to
you
this
large
number
of
cases.
i
believe
it
was
in
shea
versus
louisiana
you
looked
at
it
and
said
that
there
has
not
been
any
showing
by
anyone
that
there
would
be
this
severe
impact.
i
would
also
point
out
that
the
reliance
that
has
been
placed
on
this
particular
decision
should
always
be
construed
in
the
light
that
a
prosecutor
knew
that
at
any
time
some
litigant
could
come
forward
and
attempt
to
raise
the
question
of
the
office's
or
that
particular
prosecutor's
repeated
use
under
swain
versus
alabama
of
peremptory
challenges
in
case
after
case.
it
would
seem
to
me
that
the
prosecutors'
like
criminal
defense
attorneys,
had
an
obligation
also
to
keep
aware
of
the
changes
in
the
law
with
regard
to
equal
protection
violations.
this
court
in
batson
emphasized
that
the
standards
of
proof
continued
to
change
from
swain
up
until
batson
in
the
context
of
other
equal
protection
violations.
what
the
representatives
of
the
state
of
kentucky
say
to
you
today
is:
we
did
not
have
any
obligation
to
see
the
changes
that
were
occurring
with
regard
to
equal
protection
violations
in
any
other
context;
we
had
the
right
to
rely
solely
upon
what
was
said
in
swain.
and
yet,
they
did
not
wish
to
rely
on
the
broad
teaching,
the
actual
bright
rule
of
swain
that
was
never
changed,
and
that
is
that
prosecutors
could
not
use
peremptory
challenges
in
a
way
that
would
use
race
as
a
basis
for
disqualifying
blacks
from
participating
in
juries.
so
i
don't
believe
that
they
have
a
good
faith
argument
with
regard
to
reliance.
i
believe
we
have
demonstrated
the
need
for
a
clear
bright
line
test
on
direct
appeal
for
retroactive
application.
i
believe
that
the
experience
of
this
court
up
until
1965
demonstrates
that
that
can
be
accomplished
without
significant
harm
to
the
administration
of
justice.
and
i
think
that
in
the
right
case,
were
you
to
find
that
you
needed
not
to
give
retroactive
application
on
direct
review,
it
may
be
the
case
in
which
you
would
give
solely
prospective
application.
and
i
would
suggest
that,
even
if
we
go
to
the
shea
versus
louisiana
test
or
the
stovall
v.
denno
test,
that
we
have
demonstrated
that
mr.
griffith
is
entitled,
because
his
case
was
on
direct
review,
to
have
retroactive
application
of
batson.
