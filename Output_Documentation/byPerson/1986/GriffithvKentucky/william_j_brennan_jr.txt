i
think
you
or
at
least
others
have
cited
stovall.
do
you
recall
when
the
stovall
opinion,
which
was,
of
course,
a
collateral
case,
where
retroactivity
was
involved,
we
held
that
the
rules
should
not
be
made...
those
were
the
wade
and
gilbert
rules--
justice
william
j.
brennan,

--should
not
be
made
retro.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
then
we
went
on
to
say,
"we
also
conclude
for
these
purposes
no
distinction
is
justified
between
convictions
now
final,
as
in
the
instant
case,
and
convictions
at
various
stages
of
trial
and
direct
review.
"
"we
regard
the
factors
of
alliance
and
burden
and
the
administration
of
justice
as
entitled
to
such
overriding
significance
as
to
make
that
distinction
unsupportable.
"
and
then
went
on
to
say
that
it
is
just
too
bad
for
the...
that
only
those
whose
cases
were
actually
taken
had
the
constitutional
question
decided
in
their
favor,
this
on
the
ground
that
"we
regard
the
fact
that
the
parties
involved
are
chance
beneficiaries
as
an
insignificant
cost
for
adherence
to
sound
principles
of
decision-making.
"
do
you
think
that
is
still
law?

harlan's
view
was
usually
expressed
either
in
dissent
or
in
concurrence.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
this
opinion
went
on
to
recognize
that
inequity
arguably
results
from
according
the
benefit
of
a
new
rule
to
the
parties
in
the
case
in
which
it
is
announced
but
not
to
other
litigants
similarly
situated
in
the
trial
or
appellate
process
but
raise
the
same
issue.
justice
william
j.
brennan,

nevertheless
what
we
said
there
was
that
there
is
no
retroactivity.
justice

him--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--that's
right.
why
else
do
you
think
he
is
reading
it?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
i
just
wondered.
is
that
no
longer
law?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
well,
i
gather,
mr.
bryson,
you
don't
think
that
what
i
read
earlier
from
stovall
controls
this
case
without
more?
