justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
about
the
48
states?
aren't
there
some
states,
such
as
california,
that
had
actually
made
this
kind
of
decision
before
we
decided
batson?
so
would
they
be
among
the
48?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
weren't
really
retroactivity
decisions.
they
just
decided--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
merits
of
the
issue
before
we
did.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
about
new
york
and
the
mccray
case?
did
that
have
any
impact
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
actually
was
referring
to
the
second
circuit
opinion
after
it
was
here
the
first
time.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
haddad,
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
a
batson
claim
and
a
trial
that
arises
in
the
future,
say
someone
is
tried
tomorrow
and
a
batson
claim
is
made
and
it
is
denied
on
direct
review,
that
that
claim
could
be
raised
on
collateral
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
am
assuming
that
they
had
a
full
and
fair
hearing
in
the
state
system
that
would
satisfy
stone
against
powell
and
that
it
was
appealed
but
just
was
denied
on
the
merits,
but
there
was,
you
know,
an
arguable
basis
for
the
claim.
under
those
facts
do
you
think
it
would
be
raisable
on
collateral
review?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
bryson,
could
i
interrupt
you
for
a
minute,
because
there
are
two
aspects
about
this
case
i
would
like
you
to
comment
on.
first,
as
i
remember
it,
this
is
a
case
in
which
the
clerk
testified
that
the
prosecutor
had
requested
that
as
few
blacks
as
possible
be
put
on
the
venire,
and
apparently
the
court
of
appeals
accepted
that
testimony
and
thought
the
conduct
was
reprehensible
but
it
didn't
affect
the
outcome,
and
so
it
didn't
matter.
and
the
question
i
am
wondering
about
is,
if
you
have
facts
which
seem
clearer
than
they
are
on
some
records
there
may
have
been
a
deliberate
intent
to
minimize
the
number
of
blacks
on
the
jury
just
for
racial
reasons
alone,
is
it
as
clear
in
this
case
as
it
may
be
in
some
of
the
others
that
the
prosecutor
was
justified
in
assuming
that
his
or
her
conduct
was
entirely
proper,
and
should
we
not
since
it
is
a
federal
case
rather
than
a
state
case,
do
we
not
have
some
obligation
to
consider
our
supervisory
power
with
respect
to
the
conduct
of
federal
prosecutors
in
federal
trials?
is
it
precisely
the
same
issue
as
in
the
other
case,
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
to
add
on
other
thought,
do
you
think
that
the
federal
government
should
be
judged
by
precisely
the
same
standards
as
states
when
evaluating
the
significance
of
reliance
on
swain
and
the
prior
rule?
