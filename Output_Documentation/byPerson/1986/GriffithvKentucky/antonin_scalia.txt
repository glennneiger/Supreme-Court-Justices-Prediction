well,
that's
only
because
we
use
a
different
test
for
collateral
review.
i
mean,
we
went
through
those
additional
steps
because
those
are
the
additional
steps
we
use
for
collateral
review.
we
don't
use
them
for
direct
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
going
back
21
years,
you
can
find
a
lot
of
different
approaches,
i'm
sure.
i'm
talking
about
the
approach
that
we
were
following
at
the
time
of
allen.
we
have
followed
one
set
of
tests
for
collateral
review
and
a
different
set
for
direct
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
mind
that
in
collateral
review,
though?
you
think
that's
fair
game
there?
and
there
are
probably,
you
know,
more
cases
that
come
up
through
habeas
that
are
going
to
raise
the
same
issue
than
are
on
direct
appeal.
that
confusion
is
acceptable
in
that
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
missing
my
point.
i
think
my
point
is
the
same
as
the
chief
justice's
earlier.
that
is
to
say,
that
you're
urging
us
to
do
is
to
adopt
a
bright
line
rule
that
will
eliminate
confusion
in
the
law,
but
the
rule
you're
proposing
is
one
that
will
only
eliminate
confusion
in
the
direct
review
situation.
and
you're
not
willing
to
say,
adopt
a
similar
view
in
the
collateral
review
situation.
and
the
fact
is
that
there
are
probably
more
cases
that
are
going
to
be
coming
up
on
collateral
review
than
on
direct
review.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
trying
to
sell
us
a
new
view.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you're
not
giving
us
a
whole
view.
you're
just
giving
us
a
half
of
it.
and
i'm
saying
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
as
a
half.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think
there's
any
hypocrisy
about
it.
it's
just--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
why
is
this?
federal
officers
are
smarter
than
state
officers?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
take
a
different
oath
to
support
the
federal
constitution?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
what
is
the
basis
for
treating
the
one
different
from
the
other?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
if
it
was
apparent
to
federal
prosecutors,
it
should
have
been
apparent
to
state
prosecutors.
