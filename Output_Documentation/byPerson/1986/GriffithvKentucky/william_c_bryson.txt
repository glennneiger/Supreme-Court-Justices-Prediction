mr.
william
c.
bryson
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
summarize
briefly
what
our
position
is
in
this
case.
it
has
been
laid
out
well,
i
think,
by
the
attorney
general
from
kentucky,
but
in
essence
what
it
is
is
simply
this,
that
batson
was
a
clear
break
with
the
past.
that
the
johnson
case,
while
holding
that
ordinarily
case
new
decisions
will
be
given
retroactive
effect
on
direct
appeal,
made
an
exception
for
cases
that
it
referred
to
as
clear
break
cases,
and
that
in
allen
against
hardy
this
court
found
that
the
stovall
against
denno
factors
cut
against
full
retroactivity
for
batson.
we
put
those
three
propositions
together
and
we
submit
that
that
compels
a
finding
that
batson
should
not
be
held
retroactive
on
direct
appeal
in
this
case.
now,
justice
blackmun
asked
a
question,
i
believe,
in
the
first
argument
about
whether
this
clear
break
exception
to
the
johnson
rule
should
be
preserved,
whether
it
has
any
justification,
and
that
ties
in,
i
think,
with
the
question
of
what
the
status
of
stovall
is
with
respect
to
direct
appeal
cases
at
this
point.
as
we
read
the
court's
opinion
in
johnson,
what
the
court
was
saying
was,
yes,
we
are
adopting
to
an
extent
justice
harlan's
rule
that
the
new
decisions
would
be
applied
retroactively
on
direct
appeal,
but
we
are
not
willing
to
go
so
far
as
to
overturn
settled
precedent
in
this
area,
particularly
with
respect
to
that
area
of
settled
precedent
in
which
the
stovall
against
denno
factors
are
the
most
compelling,
and
that
is
the
definition
of
the
clear
break
area.
now,
in
the
clear
break
area,
as
this
court
recognized
in
johnson,
that
is
the
very
area
where
the
stovall
against
denno
factors
operate
very
strongly,
particularly
the
factors
of
reliance
by
prosecutors,
trial
courts,
and
courts
of
appeals,
and
the
administration
of
justice,
because
in
that
area,
that
is
the
area
in
which,
because
decisions
are
clear
breaks
from
the
past,
clear
breaks
from
prior
precedent,
and
particularly
when
they
constitute
square
overrulings
of
prior
precedent,
that
is
the
area
in
which
it
is
the
least
likely
that
lower
courts
and
law
enforcement
officers
and
prosecutors
will
have
anticipated
a
change
in
the
law,
and
as
a
result
that
is
the
area
in
which
you
will
have
the
most
number
of
cases
which
will
be
affected
by
the
change
and
in
which
you
will
have
had
reliance,
justifiable
reliance
by
people
who
read
the
law
and
attempt
to
follow
it.
so,
i
think
what
the
court
has
done
in
johnson
is
essentially
to
reach
a
compromise
between
stovall
against
denno
and
justice
harlan's
views
as
expressed
in
the
number
of
dissents.
the
court
has
preserved
that
area
of
the
stovall
analysis
that
is
the
area
in
which
it
is
the
most
telling,
and
has
otherwise
adopted
justice
harlan's
views.
now,
we
have
argued
in
the
past
for
a
straight
application
of
stovall
against
denno
to
not
only
collateral
attack
but
also
direct
review,
but
if
the
court
is
not
prepared
to
go
back
to
the
stovall
against
denno
across
the
board
rationale,
then
we
submit
that
johnson--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
i
think
in
light
of
johnson,
your
honor,
we
would
say
that
it
does
control
this
case
to
the
extent
that
the
court
concludes
that
this
is
a
clear
break
case.
now,
of
course,
if
the
court
concludes
that
it
is
not
a
clear
break
case,
then
stovall
under
the
analysis
of
johnson
doesn't
have
any
applicability,
and
the
court
would
then
go
to
the
harlan
rule
which
would
be
simply
flat-out
applicable...
retroactivity
as
applied
to
direct
review.
so
the
answer
is
yes,
but
it
is
yes
because
we
believe
this
is
a
clear
break
case,
and
that
is
a
condition
precedent
for
stovall
applying
as
we
read
johnson.
now,
that
brings
me
to
the
question,
is
this
a
clear
break
case,
and
there
is
a
lot
of
argument
in
the
briefs,
and
there
has
been
argument
this
morning
about
whether
it
is.
we
would
rely,
of
course,
very
heavily
on
both
johnson,
in
which
a
clear
break
was
defined
as
either
a
straight
overruling
or
the
court
disapproving
a
well
established
prior
practice,
we
rely
on
that;
we
would
also
rely
on
allen
against
hardy,
in
which
the
court
specifically
said
this
was
an
explicit,
that
was
an
explicit
and
substantial
break
with
the
past.
now,
i
don't,
as
i
think
general
richwalsky
said
before,
i
don't
see
any
difference
between
a
clear
break
and
an
explicit
and
substantial
break.
i
cannot
imagine
that
the
court
had
in
mind
to
draw
a
line
between
those
two
concepts,
but
in
any
event
between
johnson
and
allen
against
hardy
it
is
clear
to
us
that
this
was
a
sufficiently
new
rule
that
it
is
one
that
would
fall
within
the
court's
characterization
of
clear
break
cases.
now,
the
petitioner
and
amicus
in
this
case
have
provided
two
proposed
answers
for
the
argument
that
this
is
a
clear
break
case
one,
they
say,
well,
yes,
it
was
a
break
but
it
was
a
break
with
respect
to
burden
of
proof
question
only,
not
with
respect
to
the
underlying
standard
of
conduct,
and
second,
they
say,
well,
it
is
really
no
break,
or
to
the
extent
that
it
was
a
break
it
was
a
break
that
was
so
completely
foreshadowed
by
prior
events
that
no
one
had
the
right
to
rely
on
it.
now,
as
to
the
first,
first,
again,
going
back
to
allen
against
hardy,
the
court
in
allen
pointed
out
that
the
question
of
whether
this
was
a
break
with
regard
to
burden
of
proof
or
whether
this
was
a
break
with
regard
to
standards
of
conduct
is
of
no
moment
in
determining
whether
it
is
a
clear
break
case
for
the
simple
reason
that
courts,
prosecutors,
and
appellate
courts
were
relying
on
the
entire
rule,
not
just
the
standards
of
conduct
that
were
prescribed
in
swain,
but
also
the
principles
of
reviewability
in
swain.
that
is
why
in
case
after
case
prosecutors
declined
and
trial
courts
did
not
require
them
to
make
a
record
as
to
the
reasons
for
their
peremptory
strike
simply
because
swain
did
not
require
such
a
record
be
kept.
that
is
the
reason
that
this
reliance
by
the
prosecutors
in
trial
courts
and
appellate
courts
would
be
so
expensive
to
overturn,
because
you
would
be
sending
cases
back
for
determination
on
hearings
in
case
after
case
for
determination
of
whether
the
prosecutor
had
had
a
particular
intention
with
respect
to
strikes
as
to
which
almost
certainly
he
or
she
would
have
no
recollection
and
almost
certainly--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
think
the
court
could
conceivably
view
this
case
differently
from
the
typical
case,
and
it
is
really
not
just
because
of
the
telephone
call,
as
a
matter
of
fact.
there
are
two
features
to
this
case
that
i
think
frankly
distinguish
it
from
the
average
case
in
which...
such
as
griffith,
in
which
the
prosecutor
simply
says,
i
don't
have
to
give
an
explanation,
swain
does
not
require
me
to
give
an
explanation.
it
is
not
just
the
telephone
call.
it
is
also
that
in
fact
the
prosecutor
did
give
an
explanation
on
the
record
in
this
case.
now,
there
was
no
finding
by
the
trial
court
as
to
whether
that
explanation
was
candid
or
correct,
but
he
said
that,
yes,
i
struck
two
blacks,
and
the
reason
i
struck
them
is
because
the
defense
lawyer
for
the
co-defendant
is
a
very
imposing
and
impressive
lawyer
who
has
in
my
view
a
very
substantial
effect
on
black
jurors.
now,
with
respect
to
the
telephone
call
first,
there
is
no
question
that
the
call
was
completely
improper.
it
was
a
deplorable
incident,
and
we
are
obviously
not
defending
it
on
the
merits.
however,
to
the
extent
that
anything
in
mitigation
can
be
said,
and
i
think
something
can
be
said,
the
telephone
call,
as
the
prosecutor
explained,
was
intended
to
find
out
information
about
how
many
blacks
were
coming,
and
he
did
not
intend
to
direct
the
jury
clerk
to
strike
sub
silentio
the
blacks
who
were
on
that
incoming
panel.
now,
she
remembered
the
conversation
as
giving
her
the
impression
that
he
was
asking
her
to
strike
them.
his
impression
of
what
he
said
was,
we
are
looking
for
a
jury
which
does
not
have
many
blacks
on
it,
that
is
to
say,
i
am
hoping
not
to
have
many
blacks
on
this
jury,
not,
please,
ms.
jury
clerk,
take
those
black
jurors
off
this
jury.
now,
in
other
words,
my
point
is
that
however
unwise
his
conduct
in
making
the
call,
it
did
not
reflect
an
intent
to
skew
the
jury
in
an
improper
way.
at
most
it
reflects
something
that
he
admitted
later,
which
was
that
in
this
particular
case
he
was
looking
for
a
jury
that
had
as
few
black
members
as
possible.
that
brings
me
to
the
second
point.
what
is
the
legitimacy
of
his
having
struck
jurors
on
the
ground
that
he
claimed
that
he
did?
well,
that
goes
right
back
to
swain,
and
what
swain
said.
swain
in
fact
had
a
passage
which
it
seems
to
me
is
very
pertinent
here,
and
that
is
that
a
place
in
which
swain
quoted
the
prosecutor
as
having
said
that
he
struck
differently
depending
on
the
race
of
the
defendant
and
the
race
of
the
victim,
and
the
court
said,
well,
that
is
all
right
because
that
shows
that
he
was
not
striking
blacks
in
every
case.
and
in
this
case
this
prosecutor
indicated
on
the
record
he
did
not
strike
blacks
in
every
case.
in
fact,
he
had
no
objection
to
having
blacks
on
his
jury.
but
in
this
particular
case,
with
this
particular
lawyer
who
in
his
view
had
such
an
impressive...
had
such
a
way
of
speaking
effectively
to
black
members
of
the
jury,
he
feared,
having
black
members
on
the
jury,
he
feared
frankly
that
he
was
going
to
be
beaten.
now,
in
answer
to
your
question,
i
think
that
the
supervisory
power
would
not
be
appropriate
here
principally
because
the
jury
clerk,
as
she
testified,
was
not
in
any
way
affected
by
the
telephone
call.
it
didn't
affect
her
conduct,
and
the
telephone
call
was,
while
improper,
was
not
designed
to
have
an
effect
on
her
conduct.
the
most
it
does
is,
it
reflects
that
which
he
had
already
indicated
he
was
going
to
do,
which
is
to
strike
the
black
jurors,
and
the
second
part
of
the
answer
is
that
under
swain
we
submit
that
however
wrong
the
court
may
now
think
that
to
have
been,
it
was
permissible
under
swain,
as
we
read
swain.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--well,
in
williams
this
court
said
precisely
that.
the
williams
case,
one
of
the
series
of
retroactivity
cases,
the
court
said
that
there
is
no
basis
for
drawing
a
line
between
the
federal
government
and
the
state
governments.
now,
that
is,
i
think,
only
a
partial
answer
to
your
question
because
i
think
you
are
asking
more
about
whether
the
federal
government
has
a
greater
burden
to
anticipate
a
change
in
an
equal
protection
subject
such
as
this
one.
i
think
there
were
a
number
of
offices,
frankly,
in
which
swain
was
in
a
sense
anticipated...
i
mean
the
overruling
of
swain
was
anticipated
because
i
think
prosecutors
stopped
using
strikes
on
blacks
for
race
related
reasons
but--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--no,
i
am
just--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--not
at
all.
not
at
all.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
don't
think--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--i
don't
think
there
is
any
basis
for
treating
them
differently.
i
am
simply
saying
that
the
number
of
cases
may
be
smaller.
there
may
be
a
lesser
effect
on
the
administration
of
justice,
in
part
because
there
may
have
been...
it
is
conceivable
that
there
may
have
been
more
anticipation
of
the
overruling
of
swain.
on
the
other
hand,
unlike
in
the
state
system,
there
was
no
federal
court
at
the
time
this
case
was
tried,
no
federal
court
at
all
which
had
questioned
the
validity
of
swain,
continuing
validity
of
swain.
the
two
court
of
appeals
decisions
which
came
down
after
this
case
was
tried
in
this
area
did
question
the
validity
of
swain
in
a
sense,
but
those
were
after
this
case
was
tried.
there
were
some
state
court
cases,
i
think,
four
of
them.
four
states
had
held
that
swain
would
not
be
applied
under
state
law.
i
see
no
real
distinction
between
the
two
except,
one
could
argue,
in
the
extent
that
there
is
a
smaller
number
of
federal
cases
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
now,
the
second
question
is
one
which
i
have
already
touched
on,
which
is
the
degree
to
which
the
overruling
of
swain
was
foreshadowed,
and
therefore
any
reliance
on
swain
was
unjustified.
first
of
all,
as
i
have
noted,
there
was
very
little
contrary
law
prior
to
batson.
this
court
had
in
the
dissents
from
denial
in
the
mccray
case
and
two
subsequent
cases
had
indicated
that
swain
might
be
subject
to
reconsideration,
but
other
than
that
there
were
only
the
two
court
of
appeals
cases
going
off
on
different
grounds,
on
sixth
amendment
grounds,
and
a
handful
of
state
cases
going
off
principally
on
state
law
grounds.
but
even
if...
i
would
add
this
case
is
not
like
a
case
such
as
the
brown
case,
the
brown
against
louisiana,
which
held
the
burch
decision
retroactive,
in
which
there
was
no
case
out
there
to
be
overruled,
and
in
which
this
court's
own
decisions,
prior
decisions
had
given
a
clear
indication
that
the
burch
decision
was
on
the
way.
this
case
is
one
in
which
there
would
have
to
be
an
overruling
of
swain
and
in
which
there
were
no
prior
decisions
of
this
court
that
gave
any
indication
that
an
overruling
of
swain
was
coming.
but
beyond
that
a
mere
foreshadowing,
this
court
has
held,
is
not
enough
to
undercut
reliance
or
reader
a
case
not
a
clear
break
with
the
past.
in
the
desist
case,
this
court
dealt
with
the
question
of
whether
the
katz
overruling
of
olmstead
should
be
given
retroactive
effect,
and
the
court
said
no
even
though
there
has
probably
been
no
case
in
the...
no
constitutional
case
in
the
history
of
this
court
in
which
the
overruling
of
the
prior
decision
was
as
clearly
foreshadowed
as
it
was
in
the
case
of
olmstead.
similarly,
in
the
williams
case,
the
same
result.
this
court
said
that
chimell
should
not
be
applied
retroactively
even
though
chimell
was
clearly
foreshadowed
by
developments
in
this
court
and
in
the
lower
courts,
and
perhaps
most
pointedly,
the
case
which
we
think
supports
us
most
directly...
excuse
me...
is
the
daniels
case,
which
held
that
taylor
against
louisiana
should
not
be
applied
retroactively.
in
taylor
the
court
had
held
that
the
exclusion
of
women
from
juries
was
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment.
nonetheless,
even
though
the
court
said
the
judgment
may
appear
a
foregone
conclusion
from
the
pattern
of
this
court's
cases
over
the
past
30
years,
and
even
though
the
unmistakable
import
of
this
court's
opinions
since
1940
suggested
the
result
that
the
court
was
about
to
reach
in
taylor,
nonetheless
the
court
said
the
taylor
opinion
would
not
be
applied
retroactively
either
on
direct
review
or
on
collateral
attack
because
it
was
necessary
to
reverse
a
prior
decision
which
had
approved
the
practice.
at
minimum,
at
worst
this
case
falls
within
the
pattern
of
taylor,
and
we
submit
that
it
in
fact
is
a
such
less
extreme
case
than
taylor,
and
therefore
calls
for
the
application
of
the
clear
break
test.
now,
the
court
has
already
dealt
with,
in
allen
against
hardy,
the
question
of
the
application
of
the
stovall
factors
to
this
case,
and
i
will
not
go
through
them
at
length
except
to
point
out
very
briefly
that
as
far
as
the
most
important
of
the
stovall
factors,
which
is
the
effect
on
the
truthfinding
process,
the
court
acknowledged
in
allen
that,
yes,
the
batson
case
does
have
some
effect
on
the
truthfinding
process,
some
effect,
but
that
it
serves
multiple
purposes,
and
it
is
not
like
those
cases
in
which
the
new
rule
has
had
a
direct
and
emphatic
effect
on
the
truthfinding
process.
the
language
that
the
court
has
used
in
this
area
it
seems
to
me
is
very
instructive.
the
court
has
said,
for
example,
that
a
case
affects
truthfinding
if
there
is
a
clear
danger
of
convicting
the
innocent,
a
serious
risk
that
guilt
or
innocence
was
not
reliably
determined.
it
is
likely
that
many
trial
results
are
factually
inaccurate.
that's
the
kind
of
language
that
is
simply
inapplicable
here
because
in
this
cases,
while
the
new
rule
serves
important
and
laudable
purposes
of
reducing
discrimination
and
increasing
the
confidence
of
the
public
in
the
administration
of
justice,
it
does
not
have
a
substantial
impact
on
the
truthfinding
process
because
what
is
going
on
when
you
say
that
prosecutors
cannot
strike
blacks
on
the
ground
of
race
is
that...
not
that
you
are
allowing
on
to
a
jury
someone
who
is
biased,
as
is
the
case,
for
example,
in
a
case
such
as
turner
against
murray,
but
it
it
simply
saying
that
you
are
removing
from
the
jury
someone
who
is
unbiased,
the
black
juror,
and
you
are
replacing
that
juror
with
someone
else
who
is
presumably
also
unbiased.
now,
it
may
be
entirely
an
offensive
practice.
it
may
be...
it
has
been
declared
by
this
court
to
be
an
illegal
practice,
but
what
it
does
not
do
is
to
substantially
impact
on
the
truthfinding
process
because
of
the
nature
of
the
replacement
that
occurs.
now,
as
to
reliance.
i
have
already
spoken
at
some
length
on
the
reliance
factor,
and
i
would
only
point
out
that
to
the
extent
that
the...
to
the
extent
that
the
courts
and
commentators
have
construed
swain
on
the
question
of
whether
it
constituted
a
change
in
burden
of
proof
or
whether
it
constituted
a
change
in
the
nature
of
the
rule
affecting
substantive
conduct.
mr.
william
c.
bryson
i
am
sorry.
what
i
meant
was
that--
mr.
william
c.
bryson
--yes,
whether
batson
constituted
a
change
in
what
swain
had
said.
that's
right.
the
courts
and
commentators
talking
about
swain
have
repeatedly
held
and
repeatedly
said
that
the
swain
rule
permitted
the
use
of
race
in
making
peremptory
challenges.
the
petitioners
and
the
amici
say
that,
well,
no,
swain
didn't
really
permit
that,
but
regardless
of
whether
swain
permitted
it
or
not,
virtually
every
commentator
and
virtually
every
court
that
has
analyzed
swain
has
come
to
that
conclusion,
and
therefore
even
if
the
reliance
by
the
courts
and
by
the
prosecutors
and
by
the
appellate
courts
has
been
in
retrospect
incorrect,
it
was
certainly
not
unreasonable.
based
on
that
reasonable
reliance,
the
lack
of
effect
on
the
truthfinding
function
and
the
continuing
effect
of
a
change
in
the
administration
of
justice
we
suggest
that
the
court
should
follow
the
johnson
case
and
hold
that
this
is
a
clear
break
case
which
should
not
be
given
retroactive
effect
on
direct
appeal.
thank
you.
