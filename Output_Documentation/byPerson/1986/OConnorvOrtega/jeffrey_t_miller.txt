mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
is
a
federal
civil
rights
action
for
damages
under
42
usc
section
1983
brought
by
respondent
ortega
against
petitioners
herein.
the
suit
seeks
$250,000
in
compensatory
damages
and
$500,000
in
punitive
damages.
when
this
case
arose
in
1981,
petitioners
were
hospital
administrators
at
napa
state
hospital
in
california.
respondent
was
a
full-time
state
employed
psychiatrist
who
was
chief
of
professional
education
at
that
institution.
he
had
training
and
supervision
responsibilities
over
all
psychiatric
residents
of
the
hospital.
in
the
course
of
an
administrative
investigation
into
charges
of
work-related
wrongdoing
on
his
part,
two
of
the
petitioners
authorized
the
entry
of
respondent's
government-assigned
office
and
an
inventory
of
its
contents.
thereafter
this
suit
was
filed
in
united
states
district
court
for
the
northern
district
of
california
alleging
that
the
activity
constituted
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure
in
violation
of
respondent's
fourth
amendment
rights.
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
were
filed
by
all
parties.
the
district
court
ruled
in
favor
of
petitioners,
holding
the
activity
did
not
constitute
an
unreasonable
search
and
seizure.
the
district
court
concluded
that
there
was
a
public
necessity
to
secure
the
office,
that
the
search
was
efficacious,
and
that
the
degree
of
intrusion
was
minimal.
respondent
appealed
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
thereafter,
which
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
lower
court.
the
ninth
circuit
held
that
respondent
had
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
which
society
was
prepared
to
recognize
as
reasonable.
the
matter
was
thereafter
remanded
on
the
issue
of
damages
only.
this
court
granted
petitioner's
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
on
the
single
issue--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--yes,
they
did,
justice
brennan.
in
the
course
of
the
inventory
they
removed
three
personal
items.
and
i
will
get
to
that--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--that
belonged
to
the
respondent,
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
the
record
is
somewhat
unclear
as
to
whether
or
not
any
government
property
was
taken
from
the
office.
there
was
government
property
in
the
office.
mr.
friday,
who
is
the
hospital
administrator,
testified
that
shortly
after
the
entry
and
inventory
was
made
he
went
in
himself
to
see
how
the
progress
was
going.
in
the
process
he
saw
boxes
of
materials,
personal
items
boxed
and
on
the
floor
at
that
point,
and
he
indicated
that
he
opened
up
the
right
file
drawer.
in
the
record
itself
it
doesn't
say
whether
it
was
a
file
drawer
to
a
desk
or
to
a
filing
cabinet,
for
the
purpose
of
securing
residents'
files.
in
fact,
there
were
residents'
files
there,
and
in
addition
to
that
there
may
have
been
other
state
material
there.
the
secretary
to
dr.
ortega,
ms.
sirallo,
testified
or
gave
a
declaration
to
the
effect
that
the
respondent
often
took
residents'
files
into
his
office--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--yes,
they
were
government
files,
your
honor,
and
he
kept
correspondence
there,
too,
that
on
occasion
she
had
to
go
into
the
office
and
remove
correspondence.
the
court
granted
the
petition
for
certiorari
on
the
single
issue
of
whether
or
not
it
is
a
violation
of
a
public
employee's
fourth
amendment
rights
for
the
employer
to
make
an
inventory
of
government
papers
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
into
work-related
wrongdoing.
in
terms
of
the
factual
context,
this
case
comes
before
the
court
on
the
basis
of
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment
and
the
record
is
not
extended,
and
the
basic
facts
are
not
in
dispute.
dr.
o'connor--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--justice
scalia--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--well,
certainly
the
court
would
have
the
power
to
do
that.
if
the
question
is
whether
or
not
there
is
a
separate
seizure
element
here,
however,
that
the
court
should
address
itself
to,
we
would
submit
that
there
was
no
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
connection
with
the
types
of
repositories
that
were
searched
in
this
particular
case,
and
that
a
seizure
within
the
fourth
amendment
term
must
implicate
an
unreasonable
invasion
of
some
privacy
interest
that
is
recognized
under
the
fourth
amendment,
and
we
submit
that
that
is
not
the
case
here.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
a
desk
is
a
desk.
it
is
a
common
repository.
it
is
foreseeable
that
a
number
of
different
people
working
for
government,
from
clerical
staff
to
supervisors
to
colleagues,
will
move
into
an
office,
that
is,
enter
an
office,
open
a
desk
for
a
variety
of
reasons.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
and
the
file
is
where,
now,
in
the
desk?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
well,
it
would
depend.
in
the
abstract
it
is
very,
very
difficult
for
me
to
answer
that
question.
i
think
it
would
depend
upon
the
necessity
to
access
the
desk
to
begin
with.
if
it
is
a...
for
example,
if
we
are
dealing
with
a--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--that
is
certainly--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--it
comes
closer
to
the
line,
justice
scalia.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
it
was
usually
locked
in
his
absence.
he
had
a
key
to
the
office,
justice
marshall.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
the
hospital
administrator
had
a
key
to
the
office.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
yes,
it's
in
the
record.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
he
assumed
no
one
else
had
a
key.
he
had
a
subjective--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--it
is
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy,
your
honor.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
well,
the
two
pronged
test
of
katz
holds
that
in
order
for
the
fourth
amendment
to
apply
you
must
deal
with
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy
which
society
is
prepared
to
recognize
as
reasonable
or
legitimate,
and
that
is
a
separate
inquiry.
the
reasonableness
of
an
expectation
of
privacy
is
a
separate
inquiry,
obviously,
from
the
subjective
expectation,
and
in
this
case
there
is
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
a
subjective
expectation
of
privacy,
but
that
begs
the
issue
as
to
whether
or
not
the
expectation
of
privacy
was
reasonable
in
this
case.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
justice
o'connor,
we
are
talking
about
two
different
things
right
now.
we
are
talking
about
an
office
and
a
desk.
in
the
office
context
there
may
be
repositories
in
the
office
to
which
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
would
attach
in
the
private
sector.
however,
that
doesn't
involve,
obviously,
a
constitutional
issue,
because
once
again
we
are
in
the
private
sector
and
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply
to
that
kind
of
activity.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
obviously,
your
honor,
if
we
are
dealing
with
a
desk
of
a
supreme
court
justice,
we
have
to
put
that
in
context,
and
although
i
am
not,
certainly
not
privy
to
the
practices
of
your
honors
in
maintaining
the
security
of
your
office
and
any
expectations
you
may
have
vis-a-vis
your
colleagues...
certainly
you
don't
have
any
supervisors.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
in
their
desk
per
se
we
submit
not.
in
the
office,
once
again,
justice
o'connor,
it
depends
upon
the
types
of
repositories
that
we
are
talking
about.
if
it
is
a
repository
that
is
clearly
personal
in
nature,
for
example,
if
we
have
a
jacket
hanging
behind
a
door,
if
we
have
a
knapsack
that
is
situated
somewhere
in
the
office,
we
feel
under
those
circumstances,
once
again
in
the
abstract,
without
specific
details
attaching,
that
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
would
attach.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
no,
your
honor,
we
don't
feel
it
does.
we
feel
that
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
is
determined
upon
many
things,
the
scope
of
the
search,
the
purpose
of
the
search.
for
example--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
address
myself
to.
for
example,
if
we
have
a
public
employee
who
has
an
office,
i
think
that
public
employee
has
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
vis-a-vis
a
search
by
officers,
police
officers
in
the
traditional
context
of
the
fourth
amendment,
but
does
not
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
for
example,
that
a
supervisor
or
a
colleague
or
a
secretary
will
never
walk
into
that
office
and
open
up
a
desk
drawer
or
a
file
cabinet
or
any
other
common
repository
in
the
office
for
any
one
of
a
number
of
reasons,
legitimate
reasons
such
as
to
retrieve
property,
to
inventory
property,
to
check
on
work
performance.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
well,
there
are
many
cases,
your
honor,
where
we
would
submit
that
the
notice
requirement
may
clearly
frustrate
the
need
to
inspect.
for
example,
if
we
are
talking
about
the
context
of--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--that
was
one
purpose
of
one
of
the
petitioners.
actually,
the
individual,
justice
stevens,
in
charge
of
the
inventory
in
this
case
was
mr.
friday,
and
his
purpose
or
purposes
were
to
enter
the
office,
see
what
was
there
in
terms
of
government
property,
secure
the
government
property--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--he
chose
not
to.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
it
may
very
well
have.
i
don't
think
we
will
ever
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
notice
presupposes
participation.
notice
in
and
of
itself
doesn't
really
protect
any
expectation
of
privacy.
notice
is
only
relevant
or
useful
if
participation
or
some
involvement
is
concerned,
and
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
i
submit,
have
their--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--your
honor,
there
were
several
purposes
for
entering
that
office
and
inventorying
the
contents.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
the
computer
was
an
element
of
concern
for
petitioner
o'connor
only,
and
not--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--if
that
had
been
the
only
purpose
of
entering
and
inventorying
in
the
office
that
could
have
been
an
alternative,
but
as
this
court
has
said,
the
question
is
not
what
might
have
been,
whether
or
not
there
was
a
less
intrusive
alternative
available
to
the
actor
at
the
time.
the
question
is,
what
was
done--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--i'm
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
our
ultimate
inquiry
or
our
initial
inquiry
at
this
point,
we
submit,
is
whether
or
not
the
fourth
amendment
even
applies
to
this
kind
of
an
activity,
and
we
submit
that
at
the
threshold
it
does
not
apply.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
i
didn't
concede
that,
justice
o'connor.
i
meant
to
say
that
in
some
cases
there
can
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
given
the
context
of
what
the
search
is,
who
is
doing
the
search,
and
what
the
purpose
of
the
search
is.
in
this
kind
of
a
context
we
submit
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply,
and
in
response
to
your
question
the
facts
are
fairly
clear
as
to
what
the
motivation
was
in
this
case
and
what
was
done.
i
will
grant
you
it
is
a
short
record,
but
the
facts
are
basically
undisputed.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
that's
correct,
there
is
language
against
us
in
tlo
on
that
point,
but
at
least
tlo,
mr.
chief
justice,
made
the
initial
inquiry
into
whether
or
not
the
fourth
amendment
was
applicable,
and
in
wyman
versus
james
and
hudson
versus
palmer
this
court
held
that
in
the
context
of
those
particular
cases
the
search
or
whatever
the
activity
consisted
of,
the
contact,
as
it
was
termed
in
wymam
versus
james,
was
not
a
search
within
the
traditional
meaning
of
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence.
now,
it
is
not
our
intention
to
equate
a
prison
cell
with
a
place
of
government
employment.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
no,
the
fourth
amendment
in
the
abstract
applies
everywhere.
it
applies
to
the
world.
but
our
initial
submission
is
that
the
activity
that
took
place
in
this
case
did
not
constitute
a
search
within
fourth
amendment
jurisprudence,
and
we
base
that
on
several
different
factors.
as
we
have
already
indicated,
the
purpose
of
this
action.
secondly,
the
social--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--finding
the
computer
was
not--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--finding
the
computer
was
not
per
se
a
purpose
of
the
search,
justice
o'connor.
the
executive
director
of
the
hospital,
dr.
o'connor,
testified
that
after
he
learned
on
august
17,
1981,
the
start
time
of
the...
of
placing
respondent
ortega
on
administrative
leave,
that
the
computer
had
been
removed
by
dr.
ortega.
that
was
an
additional
concern
in
his
mind.
however,
he
commissioned
mr.
friday,
the
business
manager
of
the
hospital,
to
do
the
entry
and
the
inventory,
and
mr.
friday
testified
in
his
deposition
that
his
purposes
were
to
inventory
the
property,
to
see
what
was
there
by
way
of
state
property,
to
secure
that,
to
remove
all
property
from
the
office,
and
to
make
it
available
for
further
use
while
still
making
dr.
ortega's
property
available
to
him
for
pickup,
which
in
fact
they
did.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
yes,
justice
stevens.
there
had
been
a
claim
that
the
respondent
had
mismanaged
his
department,
that
he
had
coerced
other
medical
residents
into
making
contributions
for
the
computer,
that
he
had
misrepresented
to
the
executive
director
of
the
hospital
circumstances
surrounding
the
computer,
and
that
he
had
improperly
placed
another
medical
resident
on
administrative
leave
in
violation
of
the
rules
and
regulations
of
the
state
of
california.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
no,
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
in
this
case
is
not
adequate
to
give
you
the
facts
in
the
sense
that
the
court
of
appeals
stated
that
the
prime
motivation
for
the
search
appeared
to
be,
in
conclusionary
language,
a
motivation
to
secure
evidence
for
the
ongoing
personnel
investigation
when
in
fact
the
district
court
had
concluded
that
the
purpose
of
the
search
was
to
inventory
property
and
to
secure
the
office,
and
that
was--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--well,
we
would
submit,
justice
scalia,
that
the
district
court
made
its
findings
on
the
evidence
that
was
presented
to
the
court.
that
is
at
page
23,
justice
stevens,
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
findings
of
the
district
court.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
that
we
don't
know
at
this
point,
justice
marshall.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
no,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
why
they
could
not
have
done
it
in
his
presence.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
indicating
why
they
did
it
in
his
absence.
we
can
only
speculate
at
this
point.
finally,
we
submit
that--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--no,
your
honor,
we
don't
feel
it
is.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
yes,
the
timing
of
the
day
doesn't
make
any
difference.
if
we
are--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--it
may
not
look
good,
but
once
again
that
is
not
a
constitutional
requirement
in
this
particular
context.
we
are
looking
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
what
the
purpose
of
the
search--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
feel
there
is.
i
don't
feel
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
that
supervisors
or
colleagues
or
clerical
people
will
not
be
going
into
that
office
for
any
purpose.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
that
is
very
possible.
i
am
not
saying
in
this
particular
case
dr.
ortega
would
have
destroyed--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--i
am
at
a
loss
at
this
point
to
indicate
to
you
any
evidence
that
may
have
existed
in
that
office
relating
to
charges
of
sexual
harassment.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
there
could
be
all
kinds
of
possible--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--some
kind
of
a
document,
for
example,
containing
a
statement
that
in
fact
sexual
harassing
statements
had
been
made.
in
the
abstract
there
is
a
multitude
of
possibilities,
but
i
would
stress,
justice
marshall,
that--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--no,
we
are
not,
really,
because
in
this
case
the
stated
purpose
of
entering
the
office
was
to
inventory
the
office
to
secure
state
property--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--the
computer
was
not
relevant
to
the
inventory,
and
that
is
in
the
deposition
testimony
of
mr.
friday.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
justice
scalia,
i
would
be
happy
to
have
the
court
decide
the
case
on
the
basis
of
the
record
before
the
district
court.
no
facts.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
we
have
contentions
with
regard
to
the
record.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
the
purpose
of
the
investigation
was
to
inventory.
that
was
the
primary
purpose
of
the
investigation,
as
per
the
testimony
of
mr.
friday.
at
one
point
in
the
testimony
of
dr.
o'connor
he
states
that
he
felt
it
would
be
appropriate
for
these
people
to
look
around
the
office
to
see
if
they
can
find
any
evidence
relevant
to
the
ongoing
work-related
charges
of
wrongdoing.
now,
he
was
surmising
at
that
point.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
he
ever
communicated
that
to
mr.
friday
or
that
was
ever
communicated
to
the
people
who
did
the
inventory.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
yes.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
a
sorting
through
of
the
property.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
for
the
purpose
of
discriminating
which
was
personal
property
and
which
was
state
property.
that
was
the
charge
given
by
mr.
friday
to
mr.
stratton,
the
hospital
security
officer
who
was
actually
doing
the
inventory.
he
was
told
to
inventory
the
property
at
inception.
that
proved
to
be
a
practical
impossibility.
there
is
testimony
that
after
an
hour
or
two
it
turned
out
to
be
a
hopeless
task
for
mr.
stratton,
who
thereafter
gave
up
and
went
back
to
mr.
friday
and
indicated
what
his
finding
was
in
that
regard.
at
that
point,
mr.
friday
told
mr.
stratton
to
go
ahead
and
box
up
the
materials
as
best
he
could,
sort
through
the
property,
identify
what
was
state,
maintain
that,
secure
that,
put
the
personal
property
in
boxes,
and
put
that
in
a
stored
secured
area
some
place,
and
that
is
what
was
done.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
notion
on
the
part
of
whom,
justice
brennan?
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
specifically,
no.
if
we
are
looking
at
the
testimony
of
mr.
friday,
whose
responsibility
it
was
to
oversee
the
entry
and
inventory,
and
mr.
stratton,
who
actually
did
the
inventory,
the
only
individual
who
ever
voiced
any
concern
about
removing
property
or
looking
at
property
in
terms
of
securing
evidence
for
the
ongoing
personnel
investigation
was
dr.
o'connor,
but
there
was
no
chain
of
communication
from
dr.
o'connor
to
either
mr.
friday
or
mr.
stratton
in
that
case,
so
we
are
left,
i
think,
with
the
clear
inference
that
the
purpose
of
the
entry
and
the
inventory
was
to
do
just
as
i
indicated
to
the
chief
justice,
and
that
was
to
sort
out
the
property,
identify
which
was
personal,
identify
which
was
state,
and
to
secure
the
state--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--no,
the
district
court
did
not
use
the
word
"inventory".
it
uses
the
word
"to
secure
state
property".
obviously
that
comes
after
the--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--no,
there
is
nothing--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--well,
the
computer
had
been
removed.
that
was
a
concern
of
dr.
o'connor.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
it
appears
as
though
that
is
an
afterthought
of
the
district
court
in
that
regard,
your
honor,
because--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--the
court
indicated
that
the
purpose
was
to
secure
the
office
and
to
make
it
available
for
further
use,
i
believe,
at
some
point.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
that's
correct,
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--there
was
no
regular
policy
in
the
form
of--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
that's
correct.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
we
assume
there
are
going
to
be--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--that
wouldn't
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment,
if
in
fact--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--those
were
the
circumstances.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
yes,
because
when
we
are
talking
about
the
kinds
of
repositories
that
were
inventoried
in
this
case,
a
desk,
a
file
cabinet,
i
believe
a
bookcase.
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
in
a
constitutional
sense--
mr.
jeffrey
t.
miller
--that
would
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
it
may
give
rise
to
work
grievances,
to
state
and
common
law
tort
remedies,
justice
white,
but
it
would
not
violate
the
fourth
amendment
in
our
view.
we
also
submit
that
if
in
fact
a
fourth
amendment
interest
is
going
to
be
found
by
the
court
in
this
context,
that
the
appropriate
standard
of
protection
should
be
a
reasonableness
under
all
the
circumstances
standard
utilized
by
the
court
in
new
jersey
versus
tlo.
we
feel
that
a
warrant
requirement
would
be
unsuited
to
this
kind
of
a
context.
thank
you.
