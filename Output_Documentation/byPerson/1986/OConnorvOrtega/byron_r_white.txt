the
doctor
hadn't
been
discharged,
had
he?
he
had
just
been
placed
on
leave.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
court
of
appeals
said
there
was
no
regular
policy
of
inventorying
offices
for
people
who
were
just
on
leave.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
there
wasn't
a
policy
of
that
kind,
then
i
take
it
your
suggestion
is
that
any
time
this
particular
employer
wanted
to
enter
an
office
to
see
if
there
is
some
state
property
there
they
can
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
any
time.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
reason
to
suspect
that
there
is
or
there
isn't.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
would
apply
under
your
argument,
i
take
it,
to
any
employee,
any
regular
employee
who
isn't
on
leave,
he
is
working.
they
just
go
around
and
they
have
an
inspector
general
who
just
every
now
and
then
drops
in
on
offices
to
see
if
employees
have
their
own
things
in
their
office.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
any
time
the
public
employer
should
be
able
to
come
in
and
say,
the
employee
is
sitting
at
his
desk,
and
they
say,
please
get
up
and
leave,
we
want
to
search
your
desk,
any
time,
day
or
night.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
clean
his
office
and
gave
them
a
key
to
get
in.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
is
probably
very
likely,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
put
aside
the
desk.
i
thought
the
desk
you
said
was
a
different
matter
from
the
locked
door.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
there
more
of
an
expectation
in
the
desk
than
in
the
locked
door?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
take...
in
paragraph
8
of
the
complaint,
is
that
the
list?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
those
the
ones...
is
that
the
list
you
say
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
--is
that
what
the
evidence
bears
out,
too?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
ever
an
answer
to
this
complaint?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
what
private
papers
were
introduced,
what
papers
you
call
private
were
introduced
in
his
personnel
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
introduced
at
his
termination
hearing?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
he
terminated?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
introduced
these
for
purposes
of
impeachment,
you
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
personnel
investigation
going
on
when
the
search
was
made?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
is
the
personnel
investigation
that
ultimately
resulted
in
his
discharge?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
don't
think
this
particular
entry
had
anything
to
do
with
that
investigation.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
if
it
is
that
work-related,
all
that
means
is
that
you
should
have
a
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
they
might
have
looked
at
it
to
see
what
it
is,
but
then
they
should
have
put
it
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
shouldn't
have
seized
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
wouldn't
be
strange
if
a
private
employer
went
into
a
desk
and
seized
some
private
property
and
refused
to
give
it
back
that
he
might
get
sued
for
it.
