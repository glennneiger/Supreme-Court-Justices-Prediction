mr.
joel
i.
klein
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
our
argument
rests
on
three
propositions:
first,
that
it
is
both
customary
and
reasonable
for
a
public
employee
to
keep
personal
papers
and
effects
in
his
work
office
and
to
expect
that
the
privacy
of
such
materials
will
be
protected
against
arbitrary
searches
or
seizures
by
his
employer;
second,
that
the
application
of
the
fourth
amendment
to
office
searches
is
not
incompatible
with
the
government's
responsibilities
as
an
employer.
an
employer
rarely
needs
to
search
the
contents
of
his
employees'
offices
and
on
those
occasions
when
he
does,
the
fourth
amendment
standard
of
reasonableness
is
sufficiently
flexible
to
accommodate
legitimate
employment
interests.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
not,
your
honor,
no,
and
i
think...
the
reason
is,
i
think
those
facts
are
different
from
this
case,
but
i
do
think
that
in
many
employment
circumstances,
including
the
one
you
just
described,
justice
scalia,
that
the
expectation
is
that
employers
will
enter
the
office,
and
that
they
will
indeed,
if
the
employee
has
gone
home,
be
able
to
look
for
a
file.
that
is
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
that,
i
submit
to
you,
is
the
routine
employment
situation.
one
of
the
differences
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
that
it
was
a
locked
door,
which
i
think
tells
you
something,
and
second
of
all,
that
in
17
years
that
never
occurred.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it
makes
a
difference
in
the
following
sense,
that
i
think
it
confers
an
expectation
and
tells
the
employee
something.
this
employee,
justice
rehnquist,
was
a
psychiatrist.
he
was
also
a
professor.
and
i
think
in
that
capacity
there
was
a
recognized
need
for
the
confidentiality
of
his
office.
they
didn't
want
people
wandering
in.
indeed,
in
a
way,
when
justice
o'connor
raised
the
question
about
a
supreme
court
justice's
office.
now,
i
am
not
suggesting
that
this
was
analogous,
but
there
are
different
needs
for
confidentiality.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
in
those
circumstances,
if
the
situation
is
that
there
is
an
expectation
that
over
the
years
that
hasn't
occurred,
that
other
employees
with
locked
offices,
it
doesn't
occur,
then
i
think
the
government
can
still
enter.
the
question
is
whether
it
is
reasonable.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
not
necessarily
a
couple
of
times.
i
think
that
is
a
fact
question,
yes,
and
at
some
point
i
think
an
individual's
expectation
changes.
now,
i
don't
think
that
applies
to
his
desk
or
other
items
in
the
office.
i
think
that
in
other
words
it
is
possible
to
me,
it
seems
to
me
that
an
office
generally,
as
justice
scalia
describes,
our
expectation
is,
in
the
evenings,
when
people
go
home,
others
may
on
the
basis
of
need
enter.
and
i
think
that
is
perfectly
reasonable,
whether
you
view
that
as
part
of
the
common
understanding,
just
as
when
we
are
in
a
hotel
room
we
understand
that
there
will
be
charge
services
provided,
but
the
court
uniformly
in
its
cases--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--right
through
locked
doors.
that's
exactly
right.
but
that
doesn't
destroy
one's
expectation
of
privacy,
as
this
court
has
uniformly
held
in
various
cases.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
if
it
is
a
locked
door,
how
do
they
get
in?
they
have
a
key.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
in
this
case
the
claim
is
that
there
was
a
key.
now,
mind
you,
in
17
years
they
don't
claim
they
ever
previously--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--was
his
office
cleaned
in
17
years?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
actually,
i
assume
it
was
cleaned
in
17
years.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
who
did
he
think
had
cleaned
it?
it
is
not
clear
when
it
was
cleaned.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
it
is
not
clear
when
it
was
cleaned.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
apparently...
the
record
is
absolutely
silent,
so
we
are
speculating,
but
for
whatever
it
is
worth
he
did
spend
many,
many
hours
in
the
office,
and
so
it
is
possible,
but
more
important
than
that,
that
is
very
different
from
saying
his
employer
came
in
and
searched
his
desk
even
for
a
file.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
perfectly
plausible,
although
the
record
doesn't--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
that's
right,
but
that
would
say
nothing
about
what
the
legitimacy
of
his
expectation
was
inside
of
his
desk
and
file
cabinets.
he
certainly
didn't
expect
that
the
cleaning
people
were
going
to
go
inside
his
desk,
look
for
books
of
poetry--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
his
expectation
vis-a-vis--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
do
believe
the
desk
is
a
greater
expectation,
yes,
sir,
and
i
think
in
this
case
it
is
critical
to
point
out
that
even
if
there
is
this
common
understanding
that
people
may
enter
from
time
to
time,
i
think
a
desk
is
a
very
different
matter,
and
this
desk
was
thoroughly
and
comprehensively
searched.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
if
they
went
into
the
desk?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
question
of
whether
that
is
a
state
actor,
i
am
not
sure
about
the
answer
to
that.
i
don't
think
they
would
be
exercising
government
authority
in
that
situation.
i
think
cleaning
crews
are
instructed
not
to
presumably
enter
desks,
open
files,
so
i
think
it
would
not
rise
to
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
nevertheless,
it
would
be
an
intrusion
on
privacy,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
think
that
is
reasonable.
i
think
that
is
different
from
this
case,
justice
o'connor.
they
go
in...
in
other
words,
you
have
an
employee
who
has
a
deadline
to
do
a
product
a
week
from
now
and
you
want
to
see
how
they
are
progressing.
i
assume
the
normal
way
that
is
done
is,
we
ask
the
employee,
we
ask
to
see
a
draft,
or
a
whole
host
of
very
reasonable
ways
to
address
that
concern.
i
don't
think
it
is
reasonable
to
wait
until
the
employee
goes
home,
take
a
passkey,
go
into
his
office
and
check
his
desk.
no,
i
don't
think
that
is
reasonable.
in
any
case,
i
do
think
that
is
very
different
from
what
happened
here
because
what
they
went
on
to
do
here
is
search
at
length
personal
property
and
materials,
so
i
would
say
that
under
any
view
of
it
the
facts
of
this
case
are
much,
much
stronger
and
more
intrusive.
now,
that
leads
me
to
the
basic
questions.
it
seems
to
me
the
way
this
case--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--there
are
two
things
that
happened,
justice
rehnquist.
they
took
several
pieces
of
personal
material
and
actually
investigated
and
used
it.
some
of
it
they
introduced
at
his
employment
termination
hearing,
and
that
was
used
as
evidence
against
him.
one
piece
regarding
the
billing
of
a
private
psychiatric
patient,
not
a
hospital
patient,
the
record
says
they
investigated
that
and
took
no
further
action
on
it.
the
other
material,
and
this
is
important,
personal
material,
according
to
the
testimony,
they
boxed
it
up.
it
took
them
approximately...
there's
about
a
two-month
period
here
before
they
even
made
that
available,
so
this
respondent
was
denied
his
personal
material
for
this
two-month
period.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that's
right,
although
the
seizing
of
the
book
of
poetry
and
the
other
things,
i
think
there
is
also
a
search
issue
that
justice
scalia
touched
on,
and
that
is,
i
think
if
their
purpose,
which
it
seems
to
me
to
be
so
implausible
as
not
to
need
really
a
factual
hearing,
if
their
purpose
was
to
separate
state
and
private
property,
the
first
question
is,
why
were
they
doing
it
for
somebody
who
is
not
about
to
leave?
this
is
somebody
simply
under
investigation.
second,
when
you
do
that,
if
you
pick
up
a
book
of
poetry
you
don't
have
to
open
that
book
to
find
out
who
sent
it
to
him.
the
answer
to
that
is
apparent
on
the
face
of
the
book.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
if
that
is
what
the
law
required,
then
this
case,
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
that's
right.
now,
i
think
the
law
requires
somewhat
more
than
that
because
of
the
legitimate
expectations
of
privacy
that
employees
have
in
this
situation,
and
i
think
those
are
important.
that
is,
i
think
it
is
just
like
in
the
tlo
case.
now,
employees
are
at
work
all
day
long.
and
we
are
saying
that
their
desk
in
particular
is
an
area
that
is
right
in
their
immediate
dominion.
it
is
an
area
where
we
all
know
and
understand
people
put
personal
papers,
and--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--the
other
items
they
took...
now,
mind
you,
they
took
everything
for
a
couple
of
months,
justice
brennan,
but
the
items
they
used
and
investigated
on
this
record
were
a
picture
of
a
former
psychiatric
resident,
that
is,
a
doctor
in
study
with
dr.
ortega,
some
poetry
that
this
resident
had
sent
to
him,
as
well
as
a
book
of
poems.
then
they
took
the
file
of
a
psychiatric
patient
of
his
that
was
a
private
patient,
and
they
have
evidently
investigated
that,
although
it
is
not
clear
for
what
purpose,
because
they
subsequently
did
not
use
it,
and
that
is
what
the
record
shows
on
those
matters.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
those
are
the
materials
that
the
respondent
alleges
were
in
his
office
and
seized
for
some
period
of
time.
they
are
still
there.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
those
are
the
materials
that
were
taken
out
of
the
office.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
they
are
uncontradicted
allegations,
justice
white.
that
is,
they
don't
dispute--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--there
is
an
answer
to
this
complaint,
but
at
the
summary
judgment
stage
they
did
not
dispute
that
those
were
the
materials.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
papers
that
i
call
private
or
personal,
which
are
papers
they
admit
to
be
personal,
were
this
valentine,
there
was
a
book
of
poetry
sent
to
him,
and--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--they
introduced
it
to
impeach
the
doctor
who
testified
for
him.
in
other
words--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--yes,
he
was
terminated.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
he
had
a
former
resident
of
his
who
had
sent
him
this
material,
and
when
she
testified
for
him
at
the
hearing,
they
tried
to
impeach
her
showing,
i
guess,
that
she
was
infatuated.
in
other
words,
it
went
to
her
motive,
i
assume,
justice
white.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
absolutely,
and
they
acknowledge
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
if
i
didn't,
let
me
correct
myself.
those
were
his
papers,
personal
papers
that
they
acknowledge
were
his.
there
is
no
dispute,
and
respondents
have
repeatedly...
petitioners
have
repeatedly
conceded
that.
now,
i
want
to,
if
i
might,
go
back,
because
i
think
it
is
important
in
analyzing
the
case
to
realize
that
we
do
have
expectations
with
respect
to
our
office,
and
they
are
expectations
that
extend
to
our
employers,
and
those
are
not
different,
nor
indeed
are
they
any
less
important
than
the
expectations
that
school
children
have
in
the
case
of
tlo,
and
i
think
it
is
a
common
understanding
and
a
common
practice
that
all
of
us
share
that
when
we
go
home
a
night,
that
our
employers
will
not
come
in
and
rifle
our
desks.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
that's
correct,
but
i
also
think
it
goes
beyond
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
at
least
with
respect
to
his
desk,
yes,
sir.
that
is
correct.
and
in
other
words
i
think...
i
am
arguing
in
the
alternative
here,
justice
scalia,
because
i
think
it
is
important
that
the
more
common
understanding
which
are
not
the
facts
of
this
case,
is
that
there
will
be
some
kind
of
entries
when
employees
are
not
around,
but
i
think
even
those
are
appropriately
limited,
and
i
think
we
understand
that
and
have
a
shared
perception.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no,
i
don't
think
that's
right,
but
i
think,
that
is,
i
think
you
have
to
analyze
it
stepwise.
my
view
is
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
not
apply
in
most
situations
to
a
routine
office
entry.
that
is,
if
an
employer
or
co-worker
walks
into
your
office
looking
for
a
paperclip,
i
don't
think
that
is
a
fourth
amendment
issue.
now--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it
does
if
you
are
talking
about
a
search.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
it
does.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and
i
think
that
has
been
held
by
this
court
in
numerous
cases
that
an
office
is
one
of
those
areas
that
are
within
the
protection
of
the
fourth
amendment.
yes,
sir.
and
i
think
when
they
search
an
office,
which
i
define
to
be
the
kind
of
activity
they
did
here,
that
is,
comprehensive,
going
through
the
desk,
the
file
drawers,
its
contents,
when
they
do
that,
that
raises
a
fourth
amendment
issue
and
the
question
is
under
the
constitution
whether
it
was
reasonable.
my
view
is,
here
it
was
unreasonable
under
any
plausible
standard.
i
take
the
view
that
given
the
facts
here,
his
expectations,
and
the
purpose
of
the
search,
which
was
to
secure
evidence,
personal
evidence,
private
evidence
to
use
against
him,
that
the
appropriate
constitutional
standard
is
a
warranty,
and
i
say
that
because
this
is
somebody
who
was
singled
out,
was
under
investigation,
and
had
his
personal
material
being
seized
to
use
against
him,
and
i
think
that
is
an
appropriate
time
to
require
a
warrant.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no,
i
agree
with
you,
justice
o'connor.
the
point
as
i
understand
it
is
that
a
supervisor
can
walk
in
and
if
there
is
contraband
or
other
items
in
plain
view,
that
that
would
not
be
a
fourth
amendment
violation.
i
am
absolutely
in
agreement
with
that.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
if
it
is
in
plain
view,
so
to
speak,
yes.
now,
if
the
supervisor
goes
in
and
conducts
a
search,
then
no,
i
think
that
is
a
fourth
amendment
violation,
and
if
he
wants
that
authority
in
this
situation
where
he
goes
in
after
somebody
has
been
sent
home,
enters
through
a
passkey,
and
wants
the
authority
to
search
the
contents
in
order
to
find
evidence
knowing
full
well
that
people
keep
personal
items
there,
then
my
argument
is,
he
needs
a
warrant,
because
the
individual
interests
are
very
great
in
that
situation.
people
have
expected
that
they
will
be
allowed
to
keep
private
items
in
their
desks,
and
they
rely
on
that.
indeed,
one
option
in
an
appropriate
circumstance,
if
the
government
has
a
need
for
routine
entries
and
detailed
searches,
it
can
pass
a
regulation.
the
mint
has
that.
the
national
security
agency
has
that.
there
is
none
of
that
here.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
think
that
a
universal
regulation
that
like
that
would
hold
up,
much
as
i
don't
think
that
you
could
reverse
the
court's
decision
in
tlo
by
simply
saying
anybody
who
comes
into
a
school
can
have
their
purse
searched.
no,
i
think
there
are
standards,
and
i
think
they
grow
out
of
the
court's
inventory
cases,
that
the
government
has
to
show
a
reasonable
need
for
such
a
regulation,
and
there
are
instances.
i
mean,
the
mint
is
an
obvious
one,
the
post
office,
national
security,
but
i
don't
think
that
is
generally
the
case,
and
one
of
the
facts
that
i
think
is
important
is,
it
is
very,
very
rare
for
employers
to
conduct
this
kind
of
general
search
that
really
goes
through
everything,
and
their
needs
are
very,
very
diminished.
virtually
everything
they
need
to
accomplish
to
determine
whether
people
are
doing
their
work,
to
get
back
their
property,
they
can
do
fully
consistent
with
the
interests
of
the
fourth
amendment
and
respect
the
privacy
of
their
people.
indeed,
if
there
is
a
concern
about
whether
or
not
people
should
search
desks
because
they
are
going
to
come
in
after
hours,
one
thing
the
government
can
certainly
do
is
say,
don't
keep
business
files
in
a
desk,
that
the
desk
is,
it
is
your
dominion,
you
need
a
certain
area
for
privacy,
keep
your
private
materials
in
that
desk,
but
business
files
keep
some
place
else.
but
what
has
happened
here,
and
that
is
what
is
so
troubling,
is
the
expectation
for
17
years
was
one
way,
and
then
all
of
a
sudden
when
this
person
was
out,
for
reasons
that
even
today
we
can't
be
told,
everything
was
gone
through,
studied,
detailed
in
the
most
personal--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
led
to
his
termination.
that's
correct.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
my
view
is,
it
had
a
lot
to
do
with
that
investigation,
that
indeed
it
was
intended
to
further
the
investigation,
that
they
had
singled
him
out
and
were
searching
for
evidence
against
him,
and
that
is
precisely,
justice
white,
why
i
think
we
ought
to
have
a
warrant
in
this
case.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
think
on
those
facts,
yes,
sir,
because
they
are
claiming
the
right
to
search
for
personal
information,
but
let
me
conclude
on
this
point
that
even
if
the
warrant
standard,
and
i
think
on
the
facts
here
that
is
the
right
approach,
because
let
me
just
say
that
i
think
that
they
were
looking
for
information
to
use
against
him
to
take
his
job
away
from
him.
he
had
been
singled
out.
this
was
not
a
stop
case
like
in
prowse
or
an
administrative
search
where
people
routinely
were
told
their
offices
would
be
looked
at.
he
had
been
singled
out,
but
even
if
you
take
the
tlo
standard,
it
is
inconceivable
that
we
could
have
a
lower
standard
at
the
work
place
than
we
have
at
the
school
given
the
interests
of
employees
and
their
adult
age.
under
tlo
there
has
to
be
reasonable
suspicion
when
you
go
in
to
do
the
search
that
you
will
uncover
evidence.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
agree
with
that,
justice--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--well,
i
think
if
they
had
a
warrant
or
if
they
satisfied
the
fourth
amendment
standard.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
no,
it
doesn't...
i
am
saying
under...
i
am
not...
i
haven't
here
disputed
that
under
an
appropriate
standard
they
couldn't
seize
that
material.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
much
as
the
same
point
i
would
make,
by
the
way.
employees
often
take
materials,
work
materials
home.
that
is
something
that
people
know
about
all
the
time.
just
because
it
is
the--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--he
evidently
did.
yes,
sir.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
that
is
what
the
ninth
circuit
found.
yes,
sir.
but
the
point
being
there,
too,
of
course,
the
mere
fact
that
even
if
it
is
work
materials
involved,
employees
take
those
home,
that
obviously
doesn't
give
an
employer
the
right
to
go
search.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
what
was...
excused
me?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
what
was
searched?
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
purse.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes,
sir,
i
am.
i
think
for
fourth
amendment
purposes
i
think
that
is
absolutely
clear.
indeed,
i
do
think
that
if--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--i
think
a
student's
desk
is
different
from
an
employee's
desk.
and
i
really
haven't
analyzed
the
facts,
but
i
think
it
is
probably
less
of
an
expectation
for
a
student's
desk
than
an
employee's
desk.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
well,
i
mean,
i
guess
that
is
sort
of...
i
have
thought
about
this
in
these
terms.
that
is
what
would
it
be
worth
to
me
if
they
took
away
the
privacy
of
my
desk,
and
i
think
that
is
a
very
significant
loss.
now,
i
don't
carry
a
purse
so
i
haven't
been
able
to
make
the
comparison,
but
nevertheless...
with
the
holes
in
my
pocket
a
desk
is
an
easy
case
for
me,
but
the
point
being
here
is,
even
under
the
analysis
is,
one,
whether
there
is
an
expectation,
and
i
think
that
is
clear
on
the
facts,
and
second
of
all,
even
under
tlo
when
asked
why
they
went
in
there,
what
they
were
looking
for,
even
today
the
state
is
not
clear
what
evidence
they
were
looking
for,
and
second
of
all...
so
they
had
no
reasonable
suspicion,
and
they
never
argued
they
did,
and
second
of
all,
and
this
seems
to
me
the
unanswerable
question
remains
unanswered,
is
if
everything
else
fails,
this
scope
exceeded
its
purpose.
the
scope
of
this
search
exceeded
its
purpose.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
the
purpose
that
they
allege,
justice
rehnquist,
was
to
separate
state
and
personal
property.
that
is
what
they
have
written
in
their
brief.
if
that
is
the
purpose,
then
it
seems
to
me
clear
that
when
you
get
to
a
book
of
poetry
it
is
very
easy
to
tell
what
pile
that
book
goes
in,
so
the
scope
had
to
be
excessive.
if
it
was
an
investigative
search
i
agree
with
you
that
it
is
possible
that
they
would
have
had
a
basis
for
retrieving
that
evidence,
but
they
had
no
suspicion
that
that
evidence
would
be
there.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
yes.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
they
shouldn't
have
seized
it,
and
they
shouldn't
have
gone
so
far
as
to
read
it
to
find
out
who
sent
it
to
them.
you
pick
up
a
book
of
poetry.
on
the
cover
it
says
by
walt
whitman,
leaves
of
grass.
at
that
point
you
know
that
it
is
his.
you
put
it
in
a
box.
what
did
they
do?
they
opened
it
up,
found
out
who
sent
it
to
him.
then
they
seized
it--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--it
is
possible
that
he--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--even
if
he
does,
it
is
his
personal
papers,
and
much
of
what
he
uses--
mr.
joel
i.
klein
--the
book
of
poetry
could
be
work
related.
no,
the
question...
they
are
not
saying
whether
it
was
worked
related.
they
said
they
were
separating
personal
and
business
property.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
and
they
have
made
no
claim
that
they
issue
poetry
in
california
to
psychiatrists.
thank
you.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
i
don't
know
of
any
such
case.
i
do
know
of
one
case
in
the
third
circuit,
justice
scalia,
about
an
employee,
a
private
employer
who
opened
a...
a
private
employer
opened
an
employee's
mail
at
the
office.
in
that
case
it
was
a
tort
action.
in
this
case,
of
course,
respondent
did
allege
privacy
violations
under
state
law
which,
if
he
had
proved
up
would
have
been
equally
true
to
a
private
employer
as
well.
thank
you.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
oh,
i
think
if
he
did
what
was
done
in
this
case,
i
think
there
would
clearly
be
a
tort
action
available
for
retrieving
the
property.
i
thought
the
question
was
simply
whether
he
had
gone
into
the
desk,
not
whether
he
had
seized
the
property.
mr.
joel
i.
klein
okay.
