mr.
miller,
do
you
agree
that
in
some
circumstances
employees
in
the
private
sector
might
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
their
office
or
their
desk?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
if
there
are
such
that
there
can
be
circumstances
in
the
public
sector
when
there
is
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy?
what
about
the
desks
of
a
supreme
court
justice?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
we
won't
debate
the
subjective
element.
objectively,
are
there
public
officers
or
employees
who
in
your
view
can
ever
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
their
desk
or
their
office?

justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is...
this
case
was
decided
on
summary
judgment,
and
i
thought
you
conceded
that
there
are
some
circumstances
when
a
public
employee
might
have
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
the
office.
i
thought
you
conceded
that.
now,
if
that
is
the
case,
how
do
you
decide
this
on
summary
judgment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
don't
know
that
i
have
ever
heard
you
say
what
all
the
purposes
were.
you
said
that
finding
the
computer
was
one
of
many
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
a
general
investigatory
search?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
klein,
is
it
reasonable
for
a
supervisor
to
enter
an
employee's
desk
to
discover
whatever
might
be
appropriate
for
work-related
wrongdoing
of
some
kind?
suppose
there
is
a
deadline
to
get
out
certain
work,
and
the
supervisor
is
charged
with
making
sure
that
employees
get
the
work
out,
and
it
is
wrongdoing
on
the
part
of
the
employee
not
to
meet
that
schedule
and
get
the
work
out,
and
when
the
employee
goes
home
the
supervisor
goes
in
and
checks
the
desk
to
see
how
the
work
has
progressed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
klein,
in
the
ordinary
office
situation
if
it
is
an
office
of
public...
a
public
office,
public
employee,
public
employer,
can
the
supervisor
not
enter
that
office
in
most
instances
any
time
and
see
what
is
in
plain
view?
do
you
take
the
position
that
a
given
public
office
could
give
rise
to
a
fourth
amendment
violation
if
a
supervisor
enters
it
but
not
if
the
government-paid
janitor
enters
it
and
sees
what
is
in
plain
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
the
supervisor
walks
in
and
in
his
or
her
heart
hopes
to
find
some
obvious
evidence
of
wrongdoing
that
is
work-related?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
government
had
a
universal
regulation
saying
to
all
of
its
employees,
when
you
work
for
the
government
you
have
to
understand
that
we
have
a
right
to
make
an
inventory
search
at
any
time.
then
is
it
all
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-530,
o'connor
against
ortega
will
be
announced
by
justice
o'connor.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
this
case
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
respondent,
psychiatrist,
was
an
employee
of
a
state
hospital
in
california,
and
had
primary
responsibility
for
training
positions
in
the
psychiatric
residency
program.
hospital
officials
became
concerned
about
possible
improprieties
in
his
management
of
the
program.
particularly
with
respect
to
his
acquisition
of
a
computer
and
charges
against
him
concerning
sexual
harassment
of
female
hospital
employees
and
inappropriate
disciplinary
action
against
the
resident.
while
he
was
on
the
administrative
leave
pending
investigation
of
the
charges,
hospital
officials
allegedly,
in
order
to
inventory
and
secure
state
property,
searched
his
office
and
seized
his
personal
items
from
his
desk
and
file
cabinets
that
were
used
then
in
administrative
proceedings
resulting
in
his
discharge.
respondent
filed
an
action
against
the
hospital
officials
in
federal
district
court
under
section
1983
alleging
that
the
search
of
his
office
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
the
hospital
officials,
concluding
that
the
search
was
proper
because
there
was
a
need
to
secure
state
property
in
the
office.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
in
part
concluding
that
the
respondent
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
office,
and
that
the
search
violated
the
fourth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
for
determination
of
damages.
in
an
opinion
file
today,
we
reverse
the
partial
summary
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
and
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
we
recognize
that
searches
and
seizures
by
government
employers
or
supervisors
of
the
private
property
of
their
employees
are
subject
to
fourth
amendment
restraints.
majority
of
the
court
finds
on
the
facts
of
this
case
that
dr.
ortega
had
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
in
his
office.
that
does
not
end
the
inquiry
however,
because
it
still
must
be
determined
by
the
courts
below
whether
the
search
at
issue
complied
with
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
we
hold
that
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
the
context
of
a
search
by
a
government
employer
of
an
employee's
office
desk
or
file
cabinet
for
a
work
related
purpose,
is
one
of
reasonable
most
under
all
of
the
circumstances.
we
reject
the
application
of
a
warrant
requirement
or
a
probable
cause
standard
in
this
context.
the
opinion
is
joined
by
only
four
members
of
the
court.
justice
scalia
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
blackman
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan,
marshall
and
stevens
have
joined.
