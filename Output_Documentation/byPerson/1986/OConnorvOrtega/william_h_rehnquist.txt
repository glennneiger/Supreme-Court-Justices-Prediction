chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
85-530,
dennis
m.
o'connor,
et
al.,
versus
magno
j.
ortega.
mr.
miller,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
you
just
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply,
mr.
miller?
i
take
it
you
are
saying
not
just
what
the
court
said
in
tlo,
that
the
fourth
amendment
does
apply
to
schools,
but
in
a
much
reduced
form,
but
you
are
saying
it
doesn't
apply
at
all.
it
seems
to
me
there
is
certainly
language
in
tlo
that
is
against
you
on
that
point.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
a
search
is
not...
that
an
investigation
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
is
not
a
search
within
the
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
but
it
is
another
thing
to
say
that
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply.
i
thought
from
your
statement
you
meant
that
the
fourth
amendment
just
has
no
application
to
relations
between
superiors
and
inferiors
and
government
employment.
you
are
not
saying
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
well,
mr.
miller,
when
you
say
to
make
an
inventory
there
are
all
sorts
of
different
kinds
of
inventory.
i
mean,
you
may
make
one
in
a
hardware
store
every
six
months
without
any
thought
that
there
has
been
anything
missing
or
misplaced,
but
just
to
keep
track
of
goods.
now,
i
gather
something
more
was
meant
by
inventory
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
for
what
purpose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
miller.
we
will
hear
next
from
you,
mr.
klein.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
does
a
locked
door
make
any
difference,
mr.
klein?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
we
have
an
employee
who
was
neither
a
psychiatrist
nor
a
supreme
court
justice,
and
he
has
a
key
to
his
door,
and
locks
it
at
night
when
he
goes
home.
can
his
government
superior...
this
is
an
office
in
a
government
building...
not
enter
that
office
by
using
their
key
to
look
for
government
property?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
then
all
we
need
to
change
your
conclusion,
i
take
it,
is
if
the
government
does
in
fact
enter
a
couple
of
times,
and
then
the
expectation
is
destroyed
because
the
government
has
entered?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
klein,
let
me
ask
you
one
question
in
light
of
your
comment
there.
what
did
they
do
with
the
personal
materials
that
they
came
across?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
is
more
or
less
of
a
seizure,
i
take
it,
rather
than
a
search.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
one
could
agree
with
you
and
still
feel
that
in
a
search
like
this
or
inventory,
whatever
you
want
to
call
it,
you
are
going
to
come
across
things
that
you
realize
are
personal
at
some
stage
or
another.
there
is
no
way
of
just
automatically
staying
six
feet
away
from
them.
it
seems
to
me
that
one
can
certainly
make
an
argument
that
the
law
would
require
no
more
than
when
you
realize
something
is
personal
you
set
it
aside
and
return
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
of
course
the
evidence
you
may
uncover,
i
take
it,
may
be
personal
material.
there
is
nothing
in
the
fourth
amendment
that
prevents
a
seizure
of
personal
material
if
it
is
relevant
to
some
government
purpose.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
to
say
these
people
took
personal
material
from
the
desk
is
not
a
complete
putdown
of
the
state's
case
here.
if
the
state
were
able
to
show
that
the
material
they
took
was
relevant
to
the
personnel
investigation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
would
go
to
relevancy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
it
was
material
that
you
classify
as
personal
and
other
people
would,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
purpose
was?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
klein.
the
case
is
submitted.
