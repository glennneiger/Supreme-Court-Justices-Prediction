justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
reason,
mr.
miller,
in
such
circumstances
why
the
supervisor
can't
give
the
employee
notice
of
what
he
plans
to
do?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
looking
for
a
computer,
for
example,
as
you
were
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it.
couldn't
you
say
we
want
to
look
through
your
office
and
see
if
you've
got
the
computer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
couldn't
he
ask
the
doctor,
say,
i
would
like
to
see
what
you've
got
in
your
office
that
belongs
to
the
government?
go
through
your
papers
with
me,
and
we
will
identify
what
is
yours
and
what
is
ours.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
is
there
any
reason
why...
would
it
have
frustrated
the
purpose
of
the
search
at
all
to
give
him
adequate
notice?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
in
this
case
if
you
had
given
them
notice
you
would
have
said
the
computer
is
in
the
next
office,
and
you
would
walk
in
and
get
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
computer
was
one
of
them,
was
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
at
least
as
to
petitioner
o'connor,
wouldn't
his
purpose
have
been
served
if
he
had
given
them
notice
and
the
doctor
had
said
you
get
it
in
the
next
office?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
isn't
your
ultimate
inquiry
whether
this
is
a
reasonable
way
to
handle
the
problem?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
your
ultimate
inquiry
one
of
reasonableness,
and
aren't
there
a
lot
of
factors
that
might
affect
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
miller,
the
court
of
appeals
said
the
investigation
that
gave
rise
to
this
concern,
the
propriety
of
the
acquisition
of
a
computer,
that
was
one
thing,
and
sexual
harassment
charges.
were
there
other
reasons
for
the
investigation
besides
those
two
things?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now,
again,
you
say
the
facts
are
undisputed,
and
i
am
sure
you
are
stating
them
accurately,
but
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
recite
those,
and
the
district
court
made
no
findings,
so
how
do
we
get...
aren't
the
key
facts...
is
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
adequate
to
give
us
the
key
facts,
or
is
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
miller,
the
district
court
doesn't
say
that
either.
neither
the
court
of
appeals
nor
the
district
court.
the
district
court
just
says
they
wanted
to
secure
the
property
because
he
had
apparently
taken
something
out
and
they
didn't
want
it
to
happen
again.
that
is
the
only
reason...
as
i
read
the
page
you
just
called
my
attention
to,
it
doesn't
even
use
the
word
"inventory".
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
one...
they
thought
one...
apparently
the
computer
had
been
taken
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
infer
computer
but
they
do
say
particularly
when
something
already
has
been
removed.
what
was
it
that
they
thought
had
been
removed,
apart
from
the
computer?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
is
the
only
concern
the
district
judge
mentions
except
the
fact
they
might
put
somebody
else
in
after
he
got
fired.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
isn't
an
afterthought
because
he
says
the
strength
of
the
public
necessity
is
the
major
thing
he
has
got
to
look
at,
and
this
is
the
only
public
necessity
factor
he
mentions.
if
that
is
an
afterthought,
i
don't
know
what
the
primary
thought
was.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe
he
reads
poetry
to
his
patients.
justice
john
paul
stevens
read
poetry
to
his
patients.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it
could
be
work-related
is
what
i
am
suggesting.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
