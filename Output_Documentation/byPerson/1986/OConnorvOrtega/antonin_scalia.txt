justice

scalia
excuse
me.
with
respect
to
the
issue
that
we
agreed
to
take
cert
on,
what
if
we
found
that
there
was
an
ability
to
take
an
inventory
in
such
an
office,
but
that
this
activity
went
too
far,
that
you
can
take
an
inventory
but
not
take
away
personal
property?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
rummage
through
some
materials
that
on
their
face
upon
initial
examination
are
immediately
seen
to
be
personal.
justice
antonin
scalia
because
a
desk
is
a
desk,
and
anything
in
the
desk
is
open
to
the
employer?
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
but
what
if
i
have
a
file
in
here
that
says
"personal,
photographs
of
last
summer's
family
trip?
"
it
says
that
right
on
the
surface
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
in
the
desk.
justice
antonin
scalia
same
kind
of
investigation,
but
in
the
course
of
doing
it
they
encounter
a
file
in
the
desk
that
is
labeled
personal--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
then
they
look
into
the
file.
would
that
be
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
privacy
mean?
does
it
mean
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy
against
the
whole
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
am
just
talking
about
the
persons
against
whom
you
expect
you
have
a
right
of
privacy.
justice
antonin
scalia
which
do
you
say
it
was?
or
all
of
the
above?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
because
i
am
still
not
clear
on
your--
--if
they
have
a
right,
the
government
has
a
right,
wouldn't
that
right
be
limited
to
time
and
place
restrictions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
still
not
clear
on
how
you
want
us
to
judge
this
case.
your
contention
is
that
we
should
judge
the
validity
or
the
invalidity
of
the
search
on
the
assumption
which
the
district
court
found
that
the
purpose
of
it
was
to
inventory
and
secure
the
office,
right,
and
all
this
investigation
stuff
is
irrelevant
as
far
as
you
are
concerned.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
no
contentions
with
regard
to
that
record.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
your
contention?
do
you
assert
that
the
purpose
was
both
an
investigation
and
an
inventory,
or
just
an
inventory,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
in
determining
the
validity
of
this
entry
we
should
assume
that
the
purpose
was
to
make
an
inventory
and
secure
the
office.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
klein,
let's
assume
this
is
a
true
story.
i
am
working
on
a
case,
and
i
need
a
piece
of
paper
or
file
or
something
like
that,
as
frequently
happens,
and
my
law
clerk
has
it,
who
is
a
government
employee.
it
is
on
his
desk.
he
has
gone
home
for
the
evening
or
something.
i
go
to
his
desk
and
look
around
the
top
of
the
desk
and
i
see
it,
and
i
take
it
back
and
work
on
it.
now,
have
i
conducted
a
fourth
amendment
search
and
seizure,
and
i
am
only
immune
from
a
1983
suit
because
it
was
reasonable?
is
that
your
analysis
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
did
he
think
had
cleaned
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
a
very
strange
fact
of
the
case.
it
really
is.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
was
cleaned
during...
the
cleaning
crew
came
in
during
his
business
hours
maybe.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
if
one
of
the
cleaning
crew
went
into
the
desk
and
that
cleaning
person
was
an
employee
of
the
united
states,
that
would
have
been
a
fourth
amendment
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
keep
shifting
back
and
forth.
i
thought
we
went
around
this
before
and
you
said
the
distinctive
feature
of
this
case
was
that
it
was
a
locked
office
that
he
had
the
key
to,
he
thought
he
had
the
only
key
to,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
if
those
factors
didn't
exist
you
think
there--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
then,
if
that
is
the
approach
you
take,
that
where
there
is
not
an
expectation
of
privacy,
you
know
that
there
will
be
some
intrusions.
the
fourth
amendment
still
applies
with
regard
to
any
intrusions
beyond
that.
then
is
there
any
area
where
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply?
i
had
thought
that
typical
fourth
amendment
analysis
was
to
say
is
there
an
expectation
of
privacy,
and
if
not,
if
you
think
that
some
people
at
least
can
intrude
upon
the
area
the
fourth
amendment
doesn't
apply,
but
now
you
are
telling
me,
no,
it
continues
to
apply.
it
is
only
those
people
whom
you
expect
to
intrude
who
don't
violate
it,
and
only
to
the
extent
that
their
intrusion
is
lawful.
so
the
fourth
amendment
always
applies
everywhere.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
talking
about
an
entry.
i
am
talking
about
an
office.
is
an
office...
does
that
question
make
any
sense
to
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--whether
an
office
has
any
fourth
amendment
protections.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
was
searched
in
tlo?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
tlo.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
what
was
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
purse.
are
you
equating
a
purse
to
a
desk
as
far
as
the
expectation
of
privacy
is
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
think
a
student
would
have
as
much
expectation
that
the
student's
desk
wouldn't
be
looked
at
by
school
personnel
in
the
evenings
as
a
student
would
have
that
the
student's
purse
wouldn't
be
rummaged
through?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
personally
a
purse
is
more
different
from
a
desk
than
a
student's
desk
is
different
from
an
employee's
desk.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
klein,
you
have
got
a
couple
of
minutes.
0
[generallaughter.]
it
is
not
invariable,
but
often
when
you
have
a
right
of
privacy
against
the
government
in
a
particular
territory
or
area
such
as
a
desk
or
purse
or
what
not,
you
would
also
have
rights
against
private
individuals.
do
you
know
of
any
civil
cases,
civil
suits
against
private
employers
for
trespassing
upon
the
desk
of
invasion
of
desk
privacy
or
anything
of
that
sort?
