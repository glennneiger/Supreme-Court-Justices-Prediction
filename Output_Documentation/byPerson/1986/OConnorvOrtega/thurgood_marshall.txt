in
this
case
the
office
was
locked,

it?
wasn't
it
usually
locked
in
his
absence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
who
else
had
a
key
to
that
office?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
that
the
only
thing
in
the
record
was
that
he
had
the
key
and
he
assumed
no
one
else
had
a
key.
justice
thurgood
marshall
all
right.
well,
is
that
an
expectation
of
privacy?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
do
you
need
subjective
for?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
any
reason
why
this
couldn't
have
been
done
in
this
man's
presence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
it
say
anything...
did
it
say
why
they
couldn't
have
done
it
in
his
presence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
did
they
do
it
in

absence?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
would
have
been
all
right
to
go
in
there
in
the
middle
of
the
night?
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
it
suspicious?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
a
reasonable
expectation
that
you
won't
go
into
his
office
when
he
is
not
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
he
going
to
do,
destroy
the
records
or
something?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
were
you
going
to
find...
what
evidence
would
you
find
of
"sexual
harassment"?
justice

tell
me,
what
could
you
possibly
find
that

bear
on
sexual
