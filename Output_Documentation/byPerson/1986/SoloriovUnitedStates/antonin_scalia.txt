justice

scalia
mr.
bruce,
could
you
give
me
another
example,
the
one
that
you
would
consider
the
closest,
where
a
threshold
question
of
whether
the
court
has
jurisdiction
over
the
matter
is
to
be
determined
on
the
basis
of,
what
do
we
have,
21
factors,
and
i
assume
that
they're
not
exhausted?
is
there
a
comparable
area
of
the
law
where
we've
gotten
ourselves
into
that
kind
of
a
fix,
that
you
don't
even
know
what
court
is
supposed
to
dispose
of
the
matter
until
you
engage
in
the
kind
of
balancing
test
that
you're
talking
about?
justice

divided
up
argument
with
the
amicus,
but
is
either
you
or
the
amicus
going
to
address
the
portion
of
the
solicitor
general's
brief
that
urges
that
if
we
agree
with
you,
that
the
factors
in
relford
were
not
met,
that
we
should
overrule
relford
and
o'callahan?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
if
the
amicus
is
not
going
to
address
that,
i'd
like
to
talk
to
you
about
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
fidell,
you
say
that
it
hasn't
created
any
decision
problems.
the
briefs
all
address
the
problem
of
drug
offenses.
and
i
gather
than
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
taken
the
position
that
drug
offenses
are
automatically
related,
wherever
they
occur,
and
so
forth;
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
at
the
moment,
but
it
has
been?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
here's
my
problem
with
it.
o'callahan
and
relford
being
constitutional
decisions,
every
case
has
to
decide
the
jurisdictional
question
on
the
basis
of
a
rational
line,
is
it...
does
it
so
much
affect
the
military
and
so
forth.
that's
a
very
difficult
process,
and
it's
very
fact
bound.
now,
if
we
said
that
it
isn't
a
matter
of
constitutional
law,
that
it's
up
to
the
congress,
if
congress
doesn't
want
all
of
this
stuff
in
the
military
courts,
they
can
take
it
out
and
they
can
adopt
a
clear
line
that
says,
all
drug
offenses
will
be
tried...
by
military
personnel
will
be
tried
in
military
courts.
one
cannot
arrive
at
any
clear
lines
by
constitutional
interpretation
on
a
question
of
jurisdiction
that,
to
the
extent
possible,
ought
to
be
clear.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
couldn't
take
it
in
hand,
once
we
tell...
once
we
tell
them
it's
a
constitutional
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
i
would
do
with
a
particular
drug
offense.
and
i
think
it
to
be
very
difficult
to
say,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
whether
all
drug
offenses
are
in
or
out.
it
seems
to
me
a
hard
point.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
could
restate
the
law
of
torts
in,
you
know,
a
couple
of
lines.
[laughter]
that
doesn't
make
it
clear,
does
it?
justice
antonin

anything
that
a
reasonable
man
wouldn't
do.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
on
base
in
alaska?
justice
antonin
scalia
off
base
in
alaska;
on
base
in
new
york.
justice
antonin
scalia
general
fried,
before
you
go
further
on
the
constitutional
point,
let's
assume
we
stand
by
relford.
i
don't
understand
why
you
think
it
affects
military
discipline
or
morale
if...
let's
say
i'm
an
officer
on
a
base,
and
i
learn
that
another
officer
or
enlisted
man
for
that
matter
is
a
child
molester.
now
i
can
understand
how
that
might
affect
military
discipline
or
morale.
but
i
don't
know
why
it
would
affect
it
any
more
if
i
found
out
that,
moreover
the
child
that
this
officer
or
enlisted
man
molested,
was
a
military
child;
not
on
the
base...
somewhere
else.
why
would
that
have
any
incremental
affect
whatever
upon
the
morale
of
the
unit?
i
mean,
the
fact
that
you
have
a
child
molester
in
the
unit,
i
can
understand.
but
what
difference
does
it
make
that
the
child
is
the
child
of
another
serviceman?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
he's
a
thief,
but
he
doesn't
steal
from
his
comrades.
that's
enough?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
they
change
back?
do
we
then
change
our
constitutional
interpretation
once
again,
and
go
back
to
o'callahan?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
good
policy
argument,
but
that
can
be
made
to
the
congress.
we
wouldn't
be
saying,
you
know,
that
it
must
be
done
this
way;
we'd
just
be
saying
that
it
can
be,
as
a
constitutional
matter,
it's
permissible.
now
if
congress
agrees
with
you
that
the
military
should
expend
its
energies
on
something
else,
it
takes
a
stroke
of
the
pen.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
argument
you're
making
isn't
a
constitutional
one.
you
mean
as
a
constitutional
matter,
the
military
should
spend
most
of
its
energies
fighting
war?
