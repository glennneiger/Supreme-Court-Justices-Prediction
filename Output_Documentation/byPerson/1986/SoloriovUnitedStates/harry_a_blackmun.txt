speaking
only
now
of
the
alleged
alaska
offense,
are
we
not?
justice
harry

blackmun
not
the
new

ones.
justice
harry

had
the
alaska
authorities
indicated
any
interest
in
prosecution?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
these
particular
victims
and
their
fathers
are
no
longer
there?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
military
judge,
however,
found
otherwise?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
new
york
offenses
are
not
at
issue
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
want
to
go
back,
then,
to
the
old

argument?

and
with
it
relford,
of
course.
