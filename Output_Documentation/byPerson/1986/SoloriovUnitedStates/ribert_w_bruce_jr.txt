mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
the
offenses
committed
by
the
petitioner,
off
base
and
off
duty
in
juno,
alaska,
are
subject
to
court
martial
jurisdiction.
the
court
of
military
appeals
decision
in
this
case
should
be
reversed
for
two
reasons,
which
i'd
like
to
discuss.
first,
the
facts
of
this
case
do
not
establish
a
service
connection.
second,
the
court
of
military
appeals
found
that
there
was
court
martial
jurisdiction
in
this
case
because
it
employed
an
erroneous
and
deficient
service
connection
test.
this
court
has
recognized
that
the
special
needs
of
the
military
justify
a
unique
military
justice
system.
but
it
has
also
recognized
that
court
martial
jurisdiction
should
be
limited
to
the
least
possible
power
adequate
to
the
end
proposed.
in
this
court's
o'callahan
and
relford
decisions
it
has
limited
court
martial
jurisdiction
by
requiring
that
a
service
connection
be
established
before
a
service
member
can
be
tried
for
civilian
type
offenses
committed
off
base.
this
purpose
of
this
service
connection
requirement
is
to
balance
the
interests
of
the
service
member
in
the
greater
protections
of
a
civilian
trial
against
the
military
interest
in
trying
the
case
at
a
court
martial.
the
criteria--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--that's
correct,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
not
the
new
york
offense.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
the
alaska...
the
alaska
authorities
have
given
a
tentative
deferral
of
the
prosecution
to
the
coast
guard.
but
there
were
also
indications
of
interest
on
the
part
of
alaska
in
the
record.
in
the
record
it
indicated
that
alaska
was
continuing
to
investigate
allegations
of
charges
against
others
daughters
of
civilians
in
the
community
there.
and
there
was
also
a
message
from
the
coast
guard
that
indicated
that
the
state
of
alaska
had
previously,
and
fairly
recently
previously,
prosecuted
coast
guardsmen
for
similar
offenses.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
that's
correct,
justice
blackmun.
the
criteria
that
are
relevant
to
the
balancing
test
have
been
limited
so
that
the
infinite
permutations
of
possibly
relevant
factors
will
not
cause
confusion
about
the
proper
limits
of
court
martial
jurisdiction.
and
the
outcome
of
the
balancing
tests
depends
on
the
facts
in
each
case.
in
this
case
there's
no
military
interest
that
outweighs
the
petitioner's
interest
in
the
greater
protections
of
a
civilian
trial.
now
the
limits
on
court
martial
jurisdiction
are
not
based
solely
on
the
facts,
the
fact
that
court
martials
do
not
give
service
members
all
of
the
protections
they
would
receive
in
a
civilian
trial.
the
military
justice
system
was
created
to
serve
a
fundamentally
different
purpose
than
the
purpose
of
civilian
courts.
the
military
justice
system
is
a
tool
for
maintaining
discipline
in
the
military.
and
another
reason
for
limiting
court
martial
jurisdiction
is
the
historic
disapproval
of
trying
ordinary
crimes
at
court
martial.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
well,
the
o'callahan
decision
basically
goes
through
the
history,
especially
at
the
time
of
the
founding
of
this
country,
and
also
the
history
of
our
english
ancestors,
and
basically
states
that
there
has
been
a
disapproval
of
generally
trying
civilian
type
offenses
by
court
martial.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
well,
that...
it
did
perhaps
impliedly
overturn
these
decisions.
but
it
was
part
of
a--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--well,
even
after
the
founding
of
this
country,
o'callahan
seems
to
indicate
that
there
was
a
period
of
time
when
in
this
country
most
ordinary
offenses
were
not
tried
by
court
martial.
and
certain
for
a
court
martial...
to
try
to
court
martial
a
dependent
or
a
military
contractor
for
an
ordinary
type
of
crime
would
be
disapproved.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
well,
it
would
be
disapproved
by
this
court.
this
court
has
decided--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--as
i
say,
i
believe
that
the
founding
fathers
had
a...
and
the
history
of
our
ancestors
in
england
indicate--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--i
don't
think
the
early
decisions
of
this
court
directly
addressed
this
particular
issue.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
well,
it
was
an
extension,
i
believe,
of
some
cases
that
had
started
to
limit
jurisdiction
over
people
like
military
contractors
and
dependents.
the
court
of
military
appeals
did
not
apply
this
court's
relford
service
connection
analysis
in
this
case.
it
totally
ignored,
or
unjustifiable
minimized
petitioner's
interest
in
the
greater
protections
of
a
civilian
trial.
but
even
so,
if
the
court
of
military
appeals
had
applied
the
relford
criteria,
it
would
have
found
that
the
service
connection
question
here
isn't
even
close.
the
facts
of
this
case
simply
do
not
show
significant
impact
from
these
offenses
on
the
coast
guard.
the
petitioner
in
this
case
is
an
enlisted
man
in
the
coast
guard.
at
a
court
martial
convened
at
the
coast
guard
base
on
governor's
island,
he
was
charged
with
21
specifications
alleging
sexual
molestation
of
four
girls.
fourteen
of
the
specifications
alleged
offenses
against
two
of
the
victims
committed
off
base
and
off
duty
in
juno,
alaska.
these
are
the
offenses
that
the
trial
judge
dismissed
for
lack
of
a
service
connection.
the
seven
remaining
specifications
alleged
offenses
against
two
different
victims
on
base
at
governor's
island.
jurisdiction
over
these
offenses
has
never
been
contested.
all
of
the
victims
are
the
daughters
of
coast
guardsmen.
the
government
has
tried
to
establish
a
service
connection
in
this
case
by
asserting
every
imaginable
impact
on
the
coast
guard
that
could
possibly
result
from
the
effect
of
these
offenses
on
the
victims
and
their
fathers.
factually,
however,
the
government
was
unable
to
prove
any
significant
or
direct
impact
on
the
coast
guard
at
trial.
as
the
trial
judge
properly
found,
any
impact
was
remote
or
indirect,
and
any
military
interest
in
these
offenses
could
be
adequately
vindicated
in
a
civilian
trial.
when
make-weight
arguments
concerning
nondispositive
factors
are
stripped
away
from
the
court
of
military
appeals'
decision,
it's
clear
that
it's
based
entirely
on
the
dependent
status
of
the
victims.
the
court
of
military
appeals
did
discuss
two
other
factors
that
are
unrelated
to
the
dependent
status
of
the
victims,
that
is,
the
pendency
of
other
court
martial
charges,
and
the
difficulties
that
the
state
of
alaska
might
face
in
prosecuting
the
petitioner.
these
are
simply
make-weight
arguments,
however.
they
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
impact
of
these
offenses
on
the
coast
guard.
and
factors
such
as
these
are
too
easily
manipulated
and
too
far
removed
from
the
real
interests
that
should
be
balanced
to
be
helpful
in
setting
clear
limits
on
court
martial
jurisdiction.
because
of
the
dependent
status
of
the
victims,
the
court
of
military
appeals
also
discussed
the
nature
of
the
offenses
and
the
age
of
the
victims.
it
found
that
these
offenses
made
the
fathers
less
effective
and
unwilling
to
serve
with
the
petitioner
in
the
future.
from
this
it
inferred
that
their
units
would
suffer
some
less
of
morale.
this
overstated
and
rather
unlikely
loss
of
morale
is
really
the
only
direct...
arguably
direct
impact
on
the
coast
guard
that
the
court
of
military
appeals
discussed.
other
impacts--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--offhand,
justice
scalia,
i
can't
think
of
one.
but
that
doesn't
mean
that
there
aren't
others.
another
problem
with
this
inference
that...
based
on
the
impact
of
these
offenses
on
the
victims
and
the
fathers,
is
that
these
kind
of
inferences
can
be
drawn
from
any
serious
offense
against
a
dependent
victim.
therefore,
holding
that
these
kind
of
factors
are
significant
is
tantamount
to
holding
that
the
dependent
status
of
the
victim
by
itself
is
sufficient
to
establish
a
service
connection.
but
basically,
whether
or
not
the
court
of
military
appeals'
decision
is
viewed
as
resting
entirely
on
the
dependent
status
of
the
victims,
or
other
factors,
it
should
be
reversed
because
it
relied
on
an
erroneous
service
connection
test
that
did
not
require
proof
of
a
military
interest,
or
that
that
military
interest
outweighed
the
petitioner's
interest
in
a
civilian
trial.
the
court
of
military
appeals'
decision
glossed
over
the
fact
that
the
trial
judge
applied
all
of
the
relford
criteria
in
this
case,
and
didn't
find
a
single
one
that
supported
service
connection.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
well,
i
think
o'callahan
and
relford,
and
also
this
court's
schlesinger
decision,
all
imply
that
there's
a
balancing
here
between
the
military's
interest
in
prosecuting
a
case,
and
the
service
member's
interest
in
trial
at
a
civilian
court.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
justice
white,
that's
my
reading
of
the
cases.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
no.
sir,
i
think
the
closest--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--i
think
the
closest
that
comes
to
that
is
perhaps
language
in
schlesinger
that
basically
summarizes
the
service
connection
test,
when
it
indicates
that
there
should
be
a
unique
military
interest
that
can't
be
adequately
vindicated
in
a
civilian
court.
now,
admittedly,
that's
just
a
summarization.
it's
a
kind
of
a
shorthand,
and
doesn't
take
in
all
of
the
factors
that
have
to
go
into
the
test.
but
i
think
it
indicates
that
that's
where
the
good...
the
crisis
comes.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
i
think
that's
one
of
the
main
justifications--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--well,
the
other
one
would
be
something
that
affected
a--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--no,
sir.
the
other
thing
that
would--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
the
other
thing
that
would
trigger
it
would
be
an
impact
on
the
mission
of
the
military.
i
think
something
that
affected
discipline
or
the
mission
of
the
military
would
justify
court
martial
jurisdiction.
the--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--i
intended
it
to
be
just
a
restatement
of
the
language
in
o'callahan.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
i
believe
that
under
the
relford
decision,
if
they
had
occurred
on
a
military
base,
there
would
be
court
martial
jurisdiction.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
i
think
that
the
relford
decision
has
indicated
that
a
crime
of
violence
or
that
violates
property
on
a
military
base
may
be
sufficient
to
justify
service
connection.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
is,
excuse
me,
justice
white.
the
service
connection
analysis
applied
by
the
court
of
military
appeals
is
not
bound
by
the
result
that
this
court's
service
connection...
this
court's
relford
service
connection
analysis
requires.
rather,
it
seems
that
any
military
interest
is
sufficient
to
outweight
the
petitioner's
interest
in
a
civilian
trial.
the
court
of
military
appeals
seems
to
have
embraced
the
position
of
one
writer
who
suggested
that
the
imagination
of
the
prosecutor
was
the
only
limitation
on
court
martial
jurisdiction
now.
the
court
of
military
appeals
service
connection
analysis
is
so
flexible,
it's
meaningless.
it
permits
military
courts
to
base
jurisdiction
on
any
single
factor
or
combination
of
factors,
tangible
or
intangible,
proven
or
presumed.
it
invites
the
confusion
that
this
court
has
eliminated
by
its
remarkably
clear
relford
decision.
the
court
of
military
appeals
analysis
doesn't
set
any
limits--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
justice
scalia,
i
believe
mr.
fidell
is
going
to
address
that
point.
the
court
of
military
appeals
analysis
doesn't
set
any
limits
on
the
factors
that
can
be
considered.
it
sets
the
law
of
service
connection
back
to
the
time
before
the
relford
decision
when
there
was
concern
that
the
infinite
permutations
of
possibly
relevant
factors
would
cause
confusion
about
the
proper
limits
of
court
martial
jurisdiction.
this
court's
relford
decision
is
especially
clear
and
helpful.
it
sets
out
an
analytic
framework
based
on
definite
criteria.
those
relford
criteria
should
be
the
touchstone
for
any
service
connection
analysis.
even
accepting
for
argument's
sake
that
those
criteria
are
not
exhaustive,
that
doesn't
justify
the
court
of
military
appeals
ignoring
the
relford
criteria
and
deciding
the
service
connection
question
in
this
case
solely
on
the
basis
of
a
few
other
factors.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
first
of
all,
i'd
like
to
address
the
suggestion
that
there
should
be
a
per
se
rule,
that
any
offense
against
a
dependent
should
be
service
connected.
i
believe
it
was
in
the
case
of
toth
v.
quarles
that
this
court
pointed
out
that
the
purpose
of
the
military
is
to
fight
wars,
and
that
other
things
that
it
does
tend
to
detract
from
that.
and
i
would
say
that
if
all
of
the
offenses
against
dependents
are
held
to
be
service
connected,
that's
going
to
seriously
detract
from
the
military's
primary
purpose
of
fighting
wars.
i
mean,
you
can
obviously
think
of
cases
that
are
even
further
removed
from
military
interest
and
discipline,
or
its
military--
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
--well,
justice
scalia,
i
think
it's
really
a
constitutional
issue.
i
mean,
obviously,
there
are
limits
on
congress'
authority
to
expand
court
martial
jurisdiction.
mr.
ribert
w.
bruce,
jr.
that's
correct.
but
there
are
constitutional
arguments
to
be
made.
and
i
believe
that
this
court
would
be
evading
its
duty
if
it
deferred
to
the
military
courts
when
they
exceed
court
martial
jurisdiction
in
a
particular
case.
thank
you
very
much.
