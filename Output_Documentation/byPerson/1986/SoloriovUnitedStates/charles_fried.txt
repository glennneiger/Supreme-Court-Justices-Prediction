mr.
charles
fried
in
this
case...
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case,
petitioner
was
convicted
of
preying
sexually
on
the
young
daughters
of
fellow
servicemen,
on
and
off
base
in
alaska
and
new
york.
the
coast
guard
court
of
military
review
and
the
court
of
military
appeals
found
that
such
charges
were
sufficiently
service
connected
to
justify
trial
by
the
military
authorities.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
charles
fried
in
alaska
it
was
off
base--
mr.
charles
fried
--in
new
york,
the
offenses
were
on
base.
mr.
charles
fried
they
are
not
at
issue
here.
they
are
relevant
to
our
consideration,
justice
blackmun,
because
one
of
the
reasons
that
it
is
appropriate
to
have...
to
have
military
trial
here
is
so
that
the
whole
set...
the
whole
set
of
offenses
can
be
disposed
of
in
one
proceeding.
the
power
of
congress
to
prohibit
and
to
provide
for
court
martial
jurisdiction
of
such
offenses
is
the
power
in
the
constitution
to
make
rules
for
the
government
and
regulation
of
the
law
and
naval
forces.
the
exception,
in
the
fifth
amendment
grand
jury
clause,
for
cases
arising
in
the
land
or
naval
forces,
is
not
so
much
a
grant
of
authority
as
an
acknowledgement
that
that
congressional
authority
was
there
in
article
i
of
the
constitution.
until
o'callahan,
it
was
quite
clear,
and
was
restated
many
times...
in
the
reid
v.
covert
case,
in
toth
v.
quarles,
in
kinsella
v.
singleton...
that,
and
i
quote
here
from
singleton,
the
test
for
jurisdiction
is
one
of
status,
whether
the
accused
can
be
regarded
as
falling
within
the
term,
land
or
naval
forces.
that
is
the
language
of
article
i.
o'callahan
added
to
this
test
an
additional
requirement:
the
the
crime
be
service
connected,
in
what
this
court
characterized
as
a
clear
break
with
the
past.
taking
this
case
at
its
narrowest,
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
that
the
tendency
of
such
crimes
is
sufficiently
poisonous
of
military
morale,
and
for
the
indispensable
relations
of
trust
which
should
obtain
between
service
members,
that
they
satisfy
the
o'callahan
test,
and
are
indeed
service
connected.
we
submit
that
taking
the
paraphrase,
the
expansion
of
o'callahan,
in
councilman
in
the
1974
term,
gauging
the
impact
of
an
offense
on
miliary
discipline
and
effectiveness,
that
the
o'callahan
test
is
amply
satisfied
here.
the
argumentation
by
petitioner
and
amici
have
taken
us
far
afield
from
this
simple
truth
about
this
case.
particularly,
they
make
rather
heavy
weather
of
the
relford
decision
and
its
21
criteria.
and
i
think
they
miss
the
point
about
what
relford
represented
in
the
law
when
relford
came
along
after
the
shock
to
the
system
which
o'callahan
represented.
relford
was
decided
two
terms
after
o'callahan,
and
performed
the
signal
and
the
clarifying
service
of
laying
down
a
categorical
per
se
rule:
all
offenses
by
service
members
on
base,
the
serious
offenses,
are
subject
to
court
martial
jurisdiction.
so
what
you
had
there
was
a
per
se
categorical
rule.
that's
the
principal
effect
of
relford.
now
in
order
to
justify
and
to
explain
that
rule,
and
further
to
give
guidance
because
the
relford
court
said
that
that
per
se
rule
marked
an
area,
perhaps
not
the
limit,
in
order
to
give
further
guidance,
the
court
did
lay
dawn,
in
addition,
21
factors.
what
petitioner
and
amici
due
is
to
overlook
the
fact
that
relford
laid
down
a
categorical
per
se
rule
of
the
sort
we
seek
here.
and
to
suggest
that
each
case
requires
the
courts
to
solve
a
system
of
equations
in
21
unknowns
before
they
have
jurisdiction,
that
it
seems
to
me
turns
relford
on
its
head.
we
urge,
first
of
all,
that
on
its
individual
facts,
and
second,
as
a
categorical
matter,
that
this
case
and
cases
like
it,
which
involve
serious
depradations
against
military
defendants
by
members
of
the
armed
services
be
admitted
within
the
limits
set
out
by
relford,
and
that
this
be
done
by
a
per
se
rule
such
as
relford
itself
set
out.
first
of
all,
it
should
be
noted
that
in
relford
the
status
of
the
victims
as
persons
connected
to
the
armed
forces...
there
was
a
military
defendant
there...
was
specifically
mentioned
by
the
court.
second,
it
would
be,
we
think,
an
anomaly
to
be
concerned
for
the
integrity
of
the
topographical
limits
of
the
command,
and
to
overlook
the
fact
that
the
integrity
of
a
command
is
after
all
an
integrity
of
an
organization
of
people.
but
there
is,
as
justice
scalia
has
pointed
during
the
petitioner's
argument,
the
looming
problem
of
off
base
drug
offenses.
this
is
not
a
drug
case,
to
be
sure.
but
the
issue
is,
has
the
court
of
military
appeals
trottier
decision
in
1980,
which
creates
again
a
categorical
rule
for
off
base
drug
offenses,
with
very
little
exception,
is
that
an
improper
understanding
of
this
court's
jurisprudence?
if
it
is,
then
the
very
successful
approach
to
drug
offenses
which
the
military
has
had
is
cast
in
doubt
by
the
kind
of
procedure,
by
this
complex
eschewing
of
any
kind
of
categorical
approach
which
the
petitioners
urge
on
the
court
today.
finally,
we
urge
that
the
court
fulfill
the
work
of
relford
by
returning
the
law
to
what
it
was
when
it
was
announced
in
such
landmark
decisions
as
reid
v.
covert,
toth
v.
quarles,
kinsella
against
singleton,
and
throughout
the
whole
history
of
our
constitution,
which
is
that
service...
that
membership
in
the
service
was
a
sufficient
condition
for
court
martial
jurisdiction.
mr.
charles
fried
we
do
indeed,
justice
blackmun.
we
think
that
returning
to
the
status
argument
as
it
was
announced
in
cases
like
reid
and
toth
and
kinsella,
which
were,
after
all,
greatly
concerned
with
the
civil
liberties
issues
which
concern
the
petitioners,
going
back
to
that
rule
would
be
no
violent
unsettling
of
the
law
at
all.
it
was
o'callahan--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
would
overrule
o'callahan.
relford
started
a
process
of
narrowing
o'callahan,
and
it
did
so
in
a
very
substantial
way.
because
it
set
down
that
per
se
categorical
rule
for
all
on
base
offenses
by
service
members.
and
the
point
about
o'callahan
is
that
if
we
pull
this
one
thread,
which
we
think
is
a
bad
thread
in
the
fabric,
it
would
require
no
unravelling
of
the
fabric
of
the
law.
there
has
been
only
one
decision
since
o'callahan
in
which
this
court
once
again
considered
the
service
connection
decision,
and
that
was
relford,
which
was
a
considerable
narrowing...
i
would
say
taming...
of
o'callahan
itself.
and
indeed--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
seems
to
me,
justice
scalia,
to
make
an
enormous
difference.
because
we
are
talking
about
the
esprit
and
the
sense
of
comradeship
which
is
supposed
to
obtain
within
the
military
services.
so
preying
upon
dependents
of
your
fellow
service
members,
in
addition
to
being
a
pretty
deplorable
offense,
is
an
offense
to
the
relation
of
trust
and
comradeship
which
is
supposed
to
obtain
within
the
military
services,
and
is
an
indispensable
condition
of
the
kind
of
morale
and
trust
which
is
supposed
to
obtain
among
people
who
serve
on
ships
together,
whose
lives
depend
on
the
exact
performance
of
duty.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
comradeship
is
an
important
factor;
not
an
irrelevance.
and
was
so
judge
to
be
by
the
court
of
military
appeals.
that's
the
best
answer
i
can
offer
to
you.
it
was
thought
to
be
a
powerful
one
by
the
courts
below.
mr.
charles
fried
stealing
from
his
comrades
does
aggravate
the
offense,
and
does
indeed
implicate
the
concerns
of
the
military,
is
the
argument
we
are
submitting;
that
is
correct,
justice
scalia.
it
should
be
noted,
and
it's
a
matter
of
very
great
importance,
that
the
o'callahan
decision,
on
its
own
terms,
is
by
now
at
least
obsolete.
o'callahan
was
tried...
although
the
case
was
decided
in
the
'59...
'68
term,
o'callahan
had
been
tried
in
1956
under
the
1950
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
that
code
has
been
twice
revised
since
o'callahan
was
tried,
and
important
changes
have
occurred
in
1969
and
again,
in
1983.
the
most
important
of
these
changes
were,
first
of
all,
to
remove,
both
organizationally
and
in
terms
of
evaluation,
the
military
judge
and
the
defense
counsel
from
the
command
and
from
the
designation
by
them
convening
authority.
they
no...
the
convening
authority
no
longer
picks
the
military
judge,
as
he
did
in
o'callahan's
time;
no
longer
picks
the
defense
counsel.
that
has
been
taken
out
of
their
hands.
furthermore--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
would
think
not.
i
would
think
not.
however,
the...
what
o'callahan
did
indeed
depend
on
was
a
description
of
the
military
justice
system
which
simply
is
not
a
correct
description
of
the
military
justice
system
as
it
now
obtains.
it
may
be,
justice
scalia,
that
if
the
rule
we
propose,
which
is
the
pre-o'callahan
rule,
of
status
only,
were
to
be
reinstated,
aspects
of
the
military
justice
system
would
be
subject
to
review,
not
on
jurisdictional
grounds,
but
on
due
process
grounds.
indeed,
the
question
of
command
influence,
which
has
been
very
significantly
address
by
both
congress
and
regulation
since
o'callahan
has
been
tried,
are
issues
which
have
been
brought
to
this
court,
and
which
as
recently
as
yesterday,
the
court
denied
certiorari
in
cases
raising
that
issue.
so
it's
not
as
if
the
o'callahan
concerns
might
not
be
addressed.
we
suggest
that
they
are
not
appropriately
addressed
in
terms
of
a
jurisdictional
line.
in
fact,
the
very
best
example,
the
very
best
testimony
for
the
current
state
of
military
justice,
the
independence
and
the
zeal
of
the
defense
function,
has
been
the
defense
of
this
case
in
the
courts
below
and
in
this
court,
both
in
the
oral
and
written
presentations.
it
seems
to
us
that
a
system
which
nurtures
such
a
system
of
advocacy
against
the
extensions
of
its
own
authority
cannot
be
fairly
described,
in
justice
douglass'
mysterious
term,
as
responding
to
the
age-old
manifest
destiny
of
retributive
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
we
have
seen
exemplified
here
is
a
system
of
justice
pure
and
simple,
and
that
the
congressional
determination
of
what
the
jurisdiction
of
that
system
of
justice
is,
the
congressional
determination
and
the
determination
of
this
court,
up
until
o'callahan,
should
be
the
determination
that
spells
the
limit
of
when
that
system
of
justice
has
power
over
a
member
of
the
armed
forces.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
thank
the
court.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
the
ex
post
facto
argument
troubles
us
a
great
deal,
because
it
does
not
seem
to
us
to
be
properly
here.
the
court
of
military...
coast
guard
court
of
military
review
determined
that
there
was
service
connection
in
this
case,
and
did
so
according
to
what
i
would
call
the
intermediate
ground
which
we
ask
from
this
court;
that
is
to
say,
the
categorical
rule
of
dependency
status.
there
was
no
ex
post
facto
objection
raised
in
the
court
of
military
appeal
from
that
objection,
and
therefore,
it
seems
to
us
that
the
issue
is
not
properly
here;
it
was
waived.
and
we
have
not
been
able
to
discover
in
the
petitioner's
argumentation
any
response
to
this
point.
thank
you.
