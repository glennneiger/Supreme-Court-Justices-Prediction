mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first,
if
i
may
respond
briefly
to
a
question
that
justice
blackmun
raised
during
commander
bruce's
presentation.
on
page
57
of
the
joint
appendix
there
is
a
stipulation
that
indicates
that
if
the
coast
guard
were
to
determine
that
the
court
martial
were
without
jurisdiction
to
prosecute
the
alaska
offenses,
the
district
attorney's
office
would
reconsider
its
decision
not
to
prosecute.
so
that
there's
no
sense
in
this
case
that
the
state
has
washed
its
hands
of
the
matter.
it's
simply
waiting
to
see
the
outcome.
there
are,
we
submit,
no
reasons
to
reconsider
the
o'callahan
and
relford
cases.
there
are
three
possibilities
that
might
lead
the
court,
as
a
conceptual
matter,
to
reconsider
one
of
its
prior
decisions.
one
would
be,
for
example,
if
it
proved
that
the
historic
data
on
which
an
earlier
decision
had
been
predicated
were
incorrect
or
incomplete.
the
government
has
pointed
to
nothing
in
this
case
that
cast
doubts
on
the
historical
materials
that
were
presented
earlier.
and
we
know
of
nothing
we
can
add
to
what
was
before
the
court
when
o'callahan
was
decided.
a
second
factor
that
might
lead
the
court
to
reconsider
a
prior
determination
would
be
if
the
test
had
proved
to
be
unworkable.
but
that
also
is
not
the
case
with
respect
to
the
o'callahan
and
relford
decisions.
the
o'callahan
and
relford
decisions,
though
they've
generated
some
decisions,
some
decisional
law,
in
the
military,
and
in
the
article
iii
courts,
have
not
presented
a
substantial
problem.
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
that
question
obviously
is
always
on
the
table,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
yet
i
would
submit
that
the
decision
is
not
wrong,
and
certainly
not
so
clearly
wrong
that
it
would
lead
the
court
to
overturn
a
precedent
that
has--
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
--i
think
it
should
be
very
clearly
wrong.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
don't
think
this
is
clearly
wrong.
i
don't
think
it
was
wrong
at
all,
in
fact.
i
think
the
court
was
on
good
ground.
and
i
frankly
think
that
subsequent
history
has
proven
the
court's
judgment
to
have
been
a
profoundly
wise
matter.
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
not
quite,
justice
scalia.
the
position
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
with
respect
to
drug
offenses...
which
obviously
are
not
this
case;
there's
nothing
in
the
record
about
drug
offenses,
effect
of
drug
use
on
the
performance
of
duty
and
so
on,
so
it's
not
really
an
appropriate
vehicle
to
get
into
that,
and
i
think
there
will
be
an
appropriate
vehicle.
but
the
position
of
the
court
of
military
appeals
has
varied
over
the
years,
basically,
as
i
read
the
precedents,
as
the
membership
of
the
court
has
changed.
for
some
time
there
was
a
per
se
rule
in
the
beaker
case,
and
that
was
overruled
in
1976.
there
was
a
subsequent
rule.
at
the
moment
the
rule
is
not
a
100
percent
any
drug
case,
there's
a
service
connection.
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
for
awhile,
but
that
was
departed
from--
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
--well,
if
congress
had
taken
the
matter
in
hand,
it
might
be
a
different
question.
but
they
haven't
taken
it
in
hand,
and
it
wasn't
appropriate
in
fact...
it's
not
appropriate,
i
think--
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
--yes,
that's
correct.
but
i
would
quarrel
with
the
assumption
that
there
has
been
a
substantial
problem
in
terms
of
understanding
the
parameters
of
what
the
o'callahan
decision
and
the
relford
decision
say.
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
well,
but
it's
a
point
that
the
court
of
military
appeals,
and
the
other
military
courts,
have
been
grappling
with.
the
law
grows.
the
military
courts
are
in
this
sense
no
different
from
any
other
court
under
the
constitution,
that
it
grows
as
a
decisional
matter,
and
with
increasing
experience,
and
as
more
is
learned,
for
example,
about
the
science
and
the
toxicological
aspects
of
drug
use...
all
of
which
i
feel
somewhat
uncomfortable
about
discussing
in
this
case,
because
this
is
not
a
drug
case,
and
i
don't
think
this
should
be...
okay,
i
think
we
understand
one
another.
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
you're
think,
i
think,
justice
white,
of
the
lockwood
case.
and
the
problem
with
the
lockwood
was,
a
chain
of
events
that
began
on
case,
and
had
to
do
with
the
larceny
of
a
wallet
on
base,
and
the
larceny
and
use
of
a
government
identification
card.
so
far,
we
have
no
problem
with
what
the
court
of
military
appeals
did
in
that
case.
it's
what
they
said
in
that
case
that
gives
us
a
lot
of
trouble.
and
that,
i
think,
was
where
the
train
went
off
the
tracks
in
terms
of
the
o'callahan
and
relford
analysis.
that
was
the
beginning
of
the
substantial
confusion
as
to
what
o'callahan
and
relford
said.
indeed,
i
don't
think
there
was
confusion,
and
i
don't
think
there's
confusion
now.
it
takes
only
a
page
and
a
half,
in
the
manual
for
courts
martial,
for
the
president
to
furnish
a
restatement
of
the
law
of
service
connection.
it's
not
a
confusing
area.
it
was
pretty
much
established
by
1970,
particularly
as
regards
the
specific
narrow
issue
in
this
case,
which
is,
is
it
enough
that
the
victim
happened
to
be
a
dependent.
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
i'd
need
more
time.
[laughter]
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
but
the
problem...
the
problem,
justice
scalia,
it
might
be
my
last
clear
chance.
[laughter]
i'd
like
to
point
cut
that
there
are
some
anomalies
that
flow
from
the
decision
of
the
court
of
military
appeals.
for
example,
how
can
it
be...
and
i'm
referring
here
to
the
notion
of
the
nonbase
base...
how
can
it
be
that
the
less
base
the
coast
guard
has
in
juno,
the
greater
the
district
commander's
responsibility
for
his
personnel?
that's
an
irrational
outcome.
or
why
should
it
make
a
difference
to
look,
for
example,
at
the
danger
to
morale,
why
should
it
make
a
difference
for
purposes
of
military
jurisdiction,
whether
or
not
the
victim
is
a
dependent
of
a
member
of
the
coast
guard
or
a
dependent
of
a
member
of
the
navy?
many
towns
are
both
navy
towns
and
coast
guard
towns.
or
why
should
it
make
a
difference
if
the
victim
was
a
dependent
of
a
member
of
the
coast
guard,
but
assigned
to
some
other
unit
where
the
morale
issue
wouldn't
take
place.
and
indeed,
i'd
like
to
draw
the
court's
attention
to
another
point
in
the
joint
appendix.
there
was
testimony
on
page
101:
would
the
reputation
of
the
coast
guard
be
enhanced
if
the
coast
guard
turned
the
individual
who
is
charged
over
to
the
alaska
state
authorities?
and
the
answer
from
a
government
witness
was,
i
think
it
would,
yes.
and
that's
the
answer
to
the
problem.
if
you
have
a
concern
that
people
in
the
coast
guard
are
going
to
feel
angry
that
their...
let's
call
them
shipmates,
even
though
they
work
in
a
federal
building...
are
going
to
escape
punishment,
that
would
be
one
thing.
but
there's
no
issue
of
that
here.
what
people,
according
to
that
witness,
want,
is
they
want
to
make
sure
that
the
coast
guard
is
going
to
assist
the
local
authorities
who
have
primarily
jurisdiction
for
law
and
order
in
the
community.
that's
where
these
offenses
in
juno
took
place.
and
the
only
problem
was
that
if
somebody
misled
the
district
attorney
in
thinking
there
might
be
court
martial
jurisdiction
here
and
that
maybe
he
wouldn't
have
to
prosecute
this
case,
a
disservice
was
done
to
that
district
attorney.
and
it's
a
disservice
that's
easily
remedied.
i
would
like
to,
if
i
have
a
moment,
comment
briefly
on
the
bouie
and
marks
issue,
only
to
suggest
that
solorio
was
deprived
of
two
things
of
value
by
the
decision
of
the
court
of
military
appeals.
number
one,
he
was
deprived
of
a
complete
defense
to
the
court
martial,
because
the
court
of
military
appeals
changed
the
rules
on
him.
number
two,
because
the
u.s.
and
alaska
are
separate
sovereigns,
the
punishment
is
additive;
it
is
cumulative.
the
consequence
is
that
the
net
punishment
for
which
solorio
was
exposed...
is
exposed...
has
been
increased
on
him.
and
that
is
a
black
letter
violation
of
ex
post
facto
analysis.
i
would
also
comment
that
there's
no
notion
here
about
reliance
interests
being
frustrated.
reliance
plays
no
role,
in
our
submission,
on
this
issue.
suppose,
for
example,
an
accused
was
ignorant...
subjectively
ignorant...
of
what
the
punishment
was
for
a
particular
offense.
mr.
eugene
r.
fidell
thank
you,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
and
then
his
offense
was
committed,
and
thereafter
the
legislature
changed
the
penalty.
can
there
be
any
question
but
that
that
violates
the
ex
post
facto
clause?
thank
you.
