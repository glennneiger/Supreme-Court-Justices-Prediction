chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-1581,
solorio
against
the
united
states.
mr.
bruce,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
historic
disapproval.
i
mean,
o'callahan,
decided,
what,
'68,
'69,
was
a
departure
from
virtually
a
century
of
precedent.
there
was
no
disapproval
prior
to
o'callahan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
not
in
this
country.
look
at
all
the
cases
that
o'callahan
impliedly
overruled
from
this
court.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
where
do
you
get
your
historic
disapproval
from
in
this
country?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
disapproved
by
whom
and
when?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
before
o'callahan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
then
the
early
cases
from
this
court
didn't
properly
reflect
this
view
of
the
founding
fathers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
your
statement,
there's
a
historic
disapproval
in
this
country,
simply
isn't
supported
by
those
early
cases.
i
mean,
o'callahan
was
a
sharp
departure
from
the
precedents
of
this
court,
i
think.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
is
that
just
a
restatement
of
the
service
connected
language
in
o'callahan,
or
is
that
a
narrowing
or
a
broadening
of
o'callahan?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you
mr.
bruce.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
fidell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
reason
to
reconsider
o'callahan
would
be
if
we
simply
felt
it
was
wrong
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
law.
and
of
course
those
questions
are
open.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
has
to
be
clearly
wrong,
rather
than
just
wrong,
before
we
overrule
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
now
using
up
your
colleague's
rebuttal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fidell.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
general
fried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
mr.
bruce,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bruce.
the
case
is
submitted.
