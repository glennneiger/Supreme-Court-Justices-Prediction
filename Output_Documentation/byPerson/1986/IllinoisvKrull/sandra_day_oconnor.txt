mr.
angarola,
what
do
you
make
of
footnote
8
in
leon
dealing
with
this
particular
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
your
review
require
us
to
take
a
different
view
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
than
the
illinois
supreme
court
did?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
apparently
it
is
important
in
distinguishing
footnote
8
in
leon.
that
is
my
confusion,
i
guess.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
larkin,
when
would,
in
your
view,
the
officer's
action
not
be
taken
in
good
faith?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
there
were
an
unconstitutional
statute.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
there
is
a
single
trial
court
decision
in
the
jurisdiction
holding
it
unconstitutional
would
that
then
bind
all
police
officers
or
would
we
make
an
inquiry
into
whether
the
officer
knew
of
the
trial
court
decision?
or
do
we
wait
until
it
is
appealed,
or
what?
how
do
you
apply
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
miquelon,
is
it
your
view
then
that
there
is
more
to
fear
from
a
legislature's
departure
from
fourth
amendment
requirements
than
a
magistrate's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
your
position?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
separation
of
powers
concerns
enter
into
how
we
should
treat
the
exclusionary
rule
vis-a-vis
a
legislative
body's
departure
from
the
fourth
amendment
as
compared
to
a
magistrate's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
should
a
court
be
more
reluctant
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
when
the
legislative
body
has
departed
than
when
one
of
its
own
magistrates
has
departed
from
the
fourth
amendment--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
of
course,
it
has
the
right
to
make
its
own
determination
initially
on
constitutionality.
