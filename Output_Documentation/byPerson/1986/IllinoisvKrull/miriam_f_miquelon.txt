ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
police
officers
entered
the
premises
of
action
iron
and
metal
for
the
ostensible
purpose
of
executing
a
search
pursuant
to
a
procedural
statute
which
by
its
own
terms
directly
authorized
a
search
under
circumstances
which
did
not
satisfy
the
traditional
warrant
and
probable
cause
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment.
the
officer
had
no
search
warrant
and
had
no
probable
cause.
it
was
at
the
point
of
this
initial
unlawful
intrusion
that
the
police
officer
exceeded
the
scope
of
the
procedural
statute
and
engaged
in
the
sort
of
widespread
administrative
abuses
commented
upon
by
the
federal
district
court
in
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional.
the
statute
required
this
officer
to
engage
in
a
two-step
process,
first,
to
request
the
records
from
the
licensee,
and
then
to
engage
in
a
verification
limited
specifically
to
the
verification
of
the
records.
the
trial
court
in
this
case
explicitly
held
that
the
officer
would
have
been
within
his
statutory
authority
had
he
followed
the
two-step
process.
however,
the
trial
court
stated,
"now,
he
didn't
do
that.
"
instead,
the
officer
said
to
respondent
lucas,
can
i
go
in
and
just
look
around?
the
statute
did
not
authorize
the
officer
to
do
this,
and
he
did
not
have
a
warrant
or
probable
cause.
mr.
lucas
replied,
under
the
duress
of
the
statute,
sure.
the
trial
court
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
both
rejected
respondent's
contention
that
this
was
a
good
faith
search.
now,
the
respondent...
and
let
me
explain--
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
--i
think
they
did,
your
honor,
and
let
me
explain
how
they
did
it.
you
must
understand
that
the
petitioner
in
this
case
made
a
different
argument
in
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
their
briefs
when
they
argued
good
faith
to
the
court
at
that
time.
they
argued
that
it
was
good
faith
because
it
was
a
consent
search.
that
was
the
argument
they
made
in
their
brief.
indeed,
when
they
filed
their
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
in
this
court
they
originally
started
with
the
argument
that
it
was
a
consent
search.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
your
honor,
they
admitted
in
the
supreme
court
that
judge
hogan
determined
it
went
beyond
the
scope
of
the
statute.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
having
conceded
it
in
the
supreme
court
the
supreme
court
didn't
reverse
on
that
point.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
yes,
because
the
state
said
that
it
was
on
an
independent
basis
that
they
could
do
this,
which
was
consent,
and
in
response
to
that
the
supreme
court
said,
well,
there
was
no
consent,
and
that
is
how
they
framed
their
argument
there.
the
court...
and
i
would
say
former
chief
justice
burger
stated
in
michigan
versus
defillippo
a
clear
proponent
of
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
again,
justice
white
in
the
leon
decision
in
footnote
8
stated
that
the
exclusionary
rule
requests
suppression
of
evidence
where
obtained
pursuant
to
a
statute
not
yet
declared
unconstitutional
which
purports
to
authorize
a
search
that
doesn't
satisfy
the
traditional
requirements
of
a
warranted
probable
cause.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
i
think
you
have
to--
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
--well,
i
think
they
do,
and
i
think
defillippo
does.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
in
defillippo
the
court
specifically
states
that
a
procedural
search
statute,
unlike
a
substantive
criminal
statute,
directly
authorizes
a
search
that
is
in
violation
of
the
constitution,
whereas
a
substantive
criminal
statute
defines
some
conduct
and
the
officer--
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
--well,
i
think
then
that--
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
--because
you
are
talking
about
a
situation
where
the
sovereign
has
acted
beyond
its
lawful
discretion.
it
has
in
essence
abrogated
the
requirements
of
a
warrant
and
probable
cause.
it
has
abrogated
the
requirements
of
the
fourth
amendment
completely.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
i
would
respectfully
submit,
your
honor,
that
that
was
not
the
analysis
made
by
the
court
in
defillippo.
the
defillippo
court
specifically
found
that
it
was
by
virtue
of
completely
abrogating
the
operation
of
a
constitutional...
the
amendment,
the
fourth
amendment,
and
that
a
substantive
criminal
statute
does
not
do
that.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
in
my
view,
i
mean,
i
feel
that
where
the
sovereign
abrogates
the
bill
of
rights
and
the
constitution,
i
agree
that
the
evidence
should
be
excluded.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
because
this
court
says
that
the
search
and
the
arrest
based
on
a
substantive
unconstitutional
statute
in
and
of
themselves
are
not
unconstitutional
because
the
officer
has
probable
cause
based
on
the
statute
to
make
the
arrest
and
then
the
search
is
incident
to
the
lawful
arrest.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
i
think
there
is
another
point.
when
you
abrogate
the
probable
cause
and
warrant
requirements,
every
time
a
statute
is
conducted...
a
search
is
conducted
under
the
statute
it
is
a
violation
of
the
constitution,
which
leads
to
a
widespread
and
continuous
violation
of
the
statute.
it
is
not
the
same
thing
where
a
magistrate
makes
a
bad
judgment
call
on
a
probable
cause
determination
under
a
warrant,
but
every
time
in
a
circumstance
where
the
unconstitutional
statutory
search
is
repeated
there
is
a
violation,
and
indeed
in
this
case
the
federal
district
court
held
evidentiary
hearings
where
it
determined
that
the
administrative
abuses
under
this
statute
were
so
widespread
that
it
says
while
administrative
abuses
aren't
the
only
logic
to
declare
a
statute
unconstitutional,
they
are
so
widespread
and
so
pervasive
here
that
it
is
a
major
point
in
declaring
the
statute
unconstitutional.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
yes.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
yes,
it
is.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
i
think
that
there
is
a
separation
of
powers
issue,
and
in
our
brief
we
sort
of
quote
all
the
way
back
to
alexander
hamilton,
who
points
out
that
very
fact.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
i
think
it
should
be
more
willing
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
because
the
court
has
put
the
legislature
on
notice
as
to
what
constitutional
yardstick
is
required
when
you
abrogate
the
fourth
amendment
and
you
want
to
substitute
your
own
regulatory
scheme.
we
are
going
to
permit
you
to
do
that,
says
this
court,
but
only
when
you
do
it
in
a
constitutional
fashion
and
you
reach
a
constitutional
destination,
and
if
you
don't
do
that
then
the
sovereign
has
acted
beyond
its
lawful
discretion.
the
sovereign
has
no
right
to
empower
its
agents
to
act
in--
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
--that's
true,
and
that
was
done
in
this
case.
the
illinois
supreme
court
and
the
trial
court
determined
the
statute
was
unconstitutional.
i
would
also
say
that
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
as
articulated
by
this
court
in
the
leon
decision
is
intrinsically
tied
to
the
warrant
and
probable
cause
requirements.
it
assumes
in
the
first
instance
that
a
magistrate
first
reviews
the
affidavit
containing
the
officer's
statement
of
probable
cause,
makes
a
probable
cause
determination,
and
then
issues
the
warrant,
and
as
a
caveat
to
that,
the
court
says,
you
must
act
within
the
confines
of
the
warrant,
which
in
this
case
the
officer
didn't
even
act
within
the
confines
of
the
regulatory
scheme.
so
by
its
own
definition
the
good
faith
exclusion
doesn't
really
extend
beyond
the
warrant
context.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
i
think
if
it
directly
contravenes
the
fourth
amendment,
i
think
the
court
has
held
that
the
exclusionary
rule
would
suppress
the
evidence,
yes.
as
the
law
stands
currently
today
the
exclusionary
rule
would
apply,
and
also
the
notion
of
exigent
circumstances,
once
again,
your
honor,
particularly
in
the
search
context,
is
again
tied
directly
into
the
notion
of
the
warrant
and
probable
cause
requirement.
you
may
only
search
without
a
warrant
when
you
have
exigent
circumstances
and
probable
cause.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
no,
and
in
fact
this...
if
this
court
says
that
there
is
a
constitutional
roadmap
to
follow
when
you
are
defining
exigent
circumstances,
and
you
have
followed
our
roadmap
as
you
did
in...
you
provided
colonnada
and
biswell
and
donovan,
then
if
the
legislature
follows
that
roadmap
and
reaches
their
constitutional
destination
there
is
no
problem,
but
it
is
when
they
fail
to
do
that
that
the
court
cannot
sanction
the
sovereign
acting
beyond
its
lawful
discretion.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
when
we
say
the
slightest
mistake,
i
think
that
that
is
a
question
of
interpretation.
in
this
case
both
the
federal
district
court,
the
trial
court,
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
find
there
was
a
slight
mistake.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
i
have
to
say
that
is
true,
your
honor,
because
to
the...
now,
that
doesn't
mean
in
your
example
that
we
have
to
find
the
whole
statute
unconstitutional.
we
can
say
this
portion
of
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
you
can
continue
to
operate
under
the
rest
of
the
statute.
and
then
all
the
legislature
has
to
do,
mr.
justice,
is
to
reenact
that
portion
of
the
statute
and
make
it
constitutional,
and
then
the
issue
disappears.
i
would
reemphasize
that
there
can
be
no
objective
good
faith
reliance
on
a
procedural
statute
which
is
crafted
by
the
legislature
to
violate
the
fourth
amendment.
and
when
a
police
officer
acts
beyond
the
limited
authority
of
the
regulatory
inspection
scheme
on
his
frolic
and
detour
he
is
relying
on
no
statute
whatsoever,
and
the
issue
of
good
faith
is
inapposite.
the
officer
is
merely
acting
indiscriminately,
and
that
perhaps
is
the
best
reason
why
the
court
should
not
reach
the
constitutional
issue
in
this
case,
because
this
officer
was
indeed
acting
indiscriminately.
he
was
not
acting
within
good
faith
because
he
did
not
comply
with
the
requirements
even
of
the
unconstitutional
regulatory
scheme.
also,
again,
i
would
point
out
that
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
has
only
been
defined
within
the
context
of
a
warrant.
for
the
court
to
extend
it
beyond
the
context
of
a
warrant
would,
i
think,
take
it
out
of
the
context
in
which
it
is
currently
defined.
and
therefore
i
would
conclude
by
stating
to
the
court--
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
--well,
in
defillippo
the
court
did
not
apply
this
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
even
to
a
substantive
statute
because
this
good
faith
exception
is
defined
in
terms
of
the
warrant
requirement.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
no,
i
don't...
once
again,
i
don't
agree
with
that
respectfully,
justice
scalia.
i
believe
that
the...
what
the
court
has
said
is
that
the
officer
under
those
circumstances
has
done
everything
that
he
has
to
do
under
the
law.
he
has
applied
for
a
warrant.
he
has
filed
an
affidavit
for
probable
cause.
but
in
the
current--
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
--that
is
not
the
only
thing
wrong
with
it.
it
directly
authorizes
a
search
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
ms.
miriam
f.
miquelon
well,
that's
correct.
but
again,
this
results
in
widespread
abuses
whereas
that
situation
i
think
the
court
recognizes
that
a
magistrate
may
make
an
error
in
judgment
as
to
a
probable
cause
determination
but
that
it
the
warrant
is
still
required,
the
exercise
of
determining
probable
cause
is
still
required,
and
in
our
circumstance
we
have
abrogated
those
requirements.
you
are
in
essence
saying
that
if
the
state
enacts
an
unconstitutional
statute
and
authorizes
a
warrantless
search
which
this
court
has
determined
is
per
se
unreasonable,
the
evidence
must
be
excluded
when
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
thank
you
very
much,
your
honors.
