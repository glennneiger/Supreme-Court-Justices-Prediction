mr.
michael
j.
angarola
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
should
be
applied
to
a
warrantless
search
conducted
pursuant
to
a
presumptively
valid
statute
later
declared
unconstitutional.
petitioners'
position
is
that
the
illinois
supreme
court
erred
when
it
required
suppression
of
evidence
seized
in
the
search
of
a
junkyard,
thus
rejecting
the
state's
position
that
the
exclusionary
rule
should
not
be
applied
where
the
search
was
made
in
good
faith
reliance
of
a
presumptively
valid
statute.
the
illinois
statute
is
a
comprehensive
scheme
regulating
used
auto
parts
and
auto
metal
dealers.
that
statute
required
that
books
and
records
be
kept
on
the
premises
and
that
the
premises
of
the
yard,
the
junkyard,
be
available
for
inspection
in
order
to
determine
the
accuracy
of
the
books
and
records
of
those
kinds
of
businesses.
the
illinois
statute
has
been
in
existence
in
one
form
or
another
since
1933.
the
illinois
supreme
court
has
not
previously
ruled
on
the
statute
but
it
has
ruled
on
recordkeeping
aspects
of
the
statute.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
as
follows.
on
july
5th,
1981,
a
chicago
police
officer
went
to
the
action
iron
and
metal
junkyard
and
there
observed
a
towtruck
bringing
cars
onto
the
premises
and
leaving
without
cars.
he
entered
the
premises
and
identified
himself
to
respondent
lucas.
he
asked
lucas
if
the
yard
was
open
for
business.
the
chicago
police
officer
asked
to
see
the
books
and
records,
and
he
asked
to
see
the
license
of
the
premises.
lucas
said
he
could
not
locate
them.
lucas
showed
mcnally,
however,
a
yellow
pad
of
paper
that
contained
a
list
of
approximately
five
vehicles.
the
chicago
police
officer
asked
if
he
could
go
onto
the
yard.
lucas
said
go
right
ahead.
the
chicago
police
officer
then
recorded
while
on
the
yard
vehicle
identification
numbers
of
cars
on
the
yard.
he
checked
with
the
computer
in
the
squad
car
and
determined
that
three
of
the
vehicles
that
he
observed
in
the
yard
were
listed
as
stolen.
those
three
vehicles
were
taken
from
the
lot.
a
fourth
vehicle
which
did
not
have
any
vehicle
identification
number
on
it
was
also
taken
from
the
lot.
thus
the
police
officer's
conduct
was
objectively
reasonable
in
regard
to
his
time
of
entry,
the
manner
of
entry,
the
fact
that
he
identified
himself,
the
fact
that
he
asked
if
the
business
was
open
for
business,
the
fact
that
he
asked
to
see
the
records,
and
the
fact
that
he
asked
to
go
out
onto
the
premises
of
the
yard.
on
july
6th,
the
day
after
the
search
in
this
matter,
1981,
in
a
case
unrelated
to
the
instant
search,
the
united
states
district
court
held
the
illinois
statute
unconstitutional
because
it
did
not
sufficiently
limit
the
discretion
of
police
officers
who
had
the
authority
to
enforce
the
statute.
on
september
25th,
1981,
respondents
filed
a
motion
to
suppress
which
was
sustained.
the
illinois
supreme
court
affirmed
the
trial
court's
holding.
in
affirming
the
trial
court
the
illinois
supreme
court
erroneously
applied
the
court's
case
of
michigan
versus
defillippo
cited
at
443
us,
a
1979
case.
defillippo
is
distinguishable
from
the
instant
case
because
the
defillippo
case
involved
the
question
of
whether
a
detroit
ordinance
later
found
unconstitutional,
could
form
the
basis
of
probable
cause
to
arrest.
secondly--
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
--the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
no.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
that's
correct.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
my
apologies,
your
honor.
of
course
it
did
rule
on
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
it
found
the
statute
unconstitutional.
my
apology.
our
position
is
that
that
is
insignificant.
i
should
not
say
insignificant.
but
it
is
not
controlling
as
to
our
position
here
in
court.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
yes,
sir.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
yes,
sir.
the
search
that
occurred
in
the
defillippo
case
was
a
search
incident
to
an
arrest,
and
the
search
presently
before
the
court
involves
a
warrantless
entry
onto
the
premises
of
a
closely
regulated
business.
the
exclusionary
rule
is
meant
to
further
a
logical
public
policy.
that
public
policy
is
to
deter
police
misconduct
by
applying
the
exclusionary
rule.
you
can't
deter
police
misconduct
by
applying
the
exclusionary
rule
to
possible
mistakes
by
the
legislature.
united
states
versus
leon
allowed
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
where
a
search
which
was
later
found
defective
was
executed
and
evidence
was
seized
where
the
officers
acted
in
good
faith
reliance
on
the
search
warrant
and
that
court
determined
that
the
standard
of
reasonableness
was
an
objective
standard.
the
statute
of
the
sort
here
where
the
warrantless
entry
onto
the
premises
of
a
closely
regulated
business
is
allowed,
the
statute
stands
in
the
place
of
a
warrant,
but
the
leon
court
said
that
where
some
limitations
on
the
officer's
good
faith
reliance...
excuse
me,
that
there
were
some
limitations
on
the
officer's
good
faith
reliance
on
a
search
warrant,
and
leon
listed
three
examples
of
those
limitations,
that
when
affidavits
for
a
search
warrant
contain
reckless
falsities
or
when
a
magistrate
abandons
his
neutral
role,
or
when
the
affidavits
do
not
provide
a
substantial
basis
for
the
existence
of
probable
cause.
thus
this
court
recognized
some
limitations
to
those
search
warrants.
those
three
factors
articulated
in
leon
state
a
reasonableness
standard,
and
such
a
standard
could
be
applied
to
situations
where
a
statute
stands
in
the
place
of
a
warrant.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
footnote
8,
dealing
with
the
defillippo
or
the
cases
of
ubara,
torres?
your
honor,
those
cases
deal
with
statutes
that
provided
that
there
either
was
no
need
for
probable
cause
or
there
was
no
need
for
aspects
of
a
search
warrant.
here
our
situation
is
distinguishable
because
we
are
dealing
with
a
closely
regulated
type
business
or
a
pervasively
regulated
type
business,
a
category
of
businesses
that
this
court
has
recognized
as
to
allowing
statutes
to
stand
in
the
place
of
search
warrants.
so
i
think
that
the
situations
here
are
different
than
the
torres
case,
which
was,
of
course,
a
statute
that
required
people
traveling
from
the
united
states
into
puerto
rico
to
have
their
luggage
searched.
there
was
no
requirement
of
probable
cause
in
that
case,
and
there
was
no
establishment
or
need
for
a
warrant.
the
legislature
there
was
attempting
to
enact
a
provision
which
would
eliminate
the
need
for
a
search
warrant.
it
is
not
in
this
pervasively
regulated
businesses.
therefore
it
was
something
improper.
in
ubara,
the
state
of
illinois
had
a
statute
which
provided
for
the
search
of
all
persons
present
at
a
location
where
a
search
warrant
was
executed.
there
again,
this
court
found
that
because
the
illinois
legislature
in
this
case
was
attempting
to
enact
the
provision
that
eliminated
probable
cause,
that
those
were
improper
statutes,
and
those
statutes
were
unconstitutional.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
the
point
is
that
the
officers
acting
in
good
faith
and
having
good
faith
reliance
on
a
statute
is
the
significant
controlling
fact,
and
the
fact
whether
the
statute
is
constitutional
or
not
is
not
important
to
our
position
here.
in
other
words,
it
of
course
should
be
considered.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
well,
as
i
said,
your
honor,
leon
deals
with
a
situation
where
there
was
an
attempt
to
eliminate
the
need
of
a
search
warrant
in
all
the
cases
cited
there.
here,
in
this
instance,
because
we
are
discussing
these
pervasively
regulated
businesses,
closely
regulated
businesses,
an
area
where
this
court
has
allowed
statutes
to
stand
in
the
place
of
warrants,
i
think
that
those
cases
are
distinguishable.
i
think
the
substantive
effect
of
what
this
court
did
in
ubara
and
torres
would
remain
the
same.
if
this
court
were
to
consider
a
good
faith
exception
where
police
officers
act
in
reliance
upon
a
statute,
a
presumptively
valid
statute,
the
result
might
change,
but
the
substantive
holding
of
those
cases
would
remain
the
same.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
the
state
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
officers
were
acting
in
good
faith,
that
what
would
ordinarily
happen,
your
honor,
is
that
on
a
motion
to
suppress
there
would
be
allegations
requiring
or
alleging
certain
facts,
and
the
state
would
have
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
police
officer
acted
in
good
faith.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
no,
your
honor,
there
are
not.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
well,
your
honor,
the
trial
judge
in
this
matter
did
not
make
a
determination
regarding
good
faith
because
he
felt
it
did
not
apply.
the
trial
court
was
given
instructions
from
the
illinois
appellate
court
to
consider
the
possible
application
of
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule.
when
the
trial
court
examined
those
facts,
he
determined
that
on
the
basis
of
gates
there
was
not
a
reason
to
examine
the
good
faith
exception,
that
it
did
not
apply,
so
he
did
not
make
a
determination
regarding
good
faith.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
this
statute
or
its
predecessor,
since
1933.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
no,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
the
objective
factors
regarding
the
entry,
the
identification,
all
the
circumstances
involving
the
warrantless
entry
here
are
factors
which
would
go
to
show
the
good
faith
of
the
police
officer.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
think
the
record
is
confused
in
that
area.
i
think
when
you
look
at
judge
hogan's
ruling
it
is
that
he
determined
that
because
respondent
lucas
did
not
show
books
and
records
at
the
time
that
the
police
officer
asked
for
it,
that
he
could
not
go
on
to
that
second
stage,
but
i
think
that
is
incorrect,
because
i
think
that
when
respondent
lucas
shows
the
police
officer
a
yellow
pad
of
paper
containing
a
list
of
vehicles,
that
those
are
the
kind
of
information
that
the
illinois
statute
was
speaking
to,
and
he
could
in
fact
go
onto
the
premises,
but
there
is
no
specific
rule.
i
think
the
ruling
is
confused
in
that
area.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
no,
it
did
not.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
that's
right.
the
illinois
supreme
court
did
not
address
itself
to
the
scope
of
the
officer's
activities,
but
we
believe
that
implicit
in
what
the
supreme
court
did
because
it
went
on
to
consider
the
constitutionality
is
a
determination
that
the
police
officer
was
acting
in
the
scope.
in
other
words,
the
illinois
supreme
court
could
have
made
a
determination
that
the
police
officer
was
not
acting
within
the
scope
of
his
authority,
but
there
is,
your
honor,
there
is
no
specific
holding
such
as
that
in
the
illinois
supreme
court.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
well,
your
honor,
because
i
believe
that
the
facts
and
circumstances
here
indicate
that
the
police
officer
did
in
fact
act
within
the
scope
of
the
authority.
i
think
the
judge's
interpretation
that
he
had
an
obligation
to
actually
see
books
and
records,
in
the
transcript
the
judge
seems
to
think
that
there
is
a
need
for
the
respondent
lucas
to
show
the
police
officer
books
and
records
before
the
police
officer
could
go
onto
the
premises,
and
i
think
that's--
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
--yes.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
illinois
is
entitled
to
have
a
silly
law,
but
your
honor,
i
would
suggest
that
that
interpretation
would
give
the
statute
no
meaning
whatsoever.
that
would
mean
that
a
respondent
or
someone
in
the
auto
parts
business
could
prevent
the
second
stage,
the
inspection
of
the
premises
for
determining
the
accuracy
of
the
books
and
records
by
merely
not
having
the
books
and
records
on
the
premises,
and
that
would
mean
that
the
statute
would
have
no
meaning.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
well,
your
honor,
in
terms
of
the
purpose
of
the
statute,
which
is
to
have
recordkeeping,
and
i
think
that
if
the
statute
could
be
avoided
by
simply
not
having
books
and
records
there,
that
that
is
avoiding--
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
--pardon
me?
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
no,
no.
no,
your
honor,
it
is
not
a
silly
sanction,
but
i
believe
that
the
purpose
and
intent
of
the
statute
could
not
be
avoided
by
merely
not
having
books
and
records,
and
i
also
believe,
your
honor,
and
i
submit
that
that
yellow
pad
of
paper
is
the
kind
of
information
the
statute
speaks
of,
and
when
the
officer
looked
at
that
yellow
pad
of
paper
he
then
had
the
authority
to
go
onto
the
premises.
in
fact,
he
didn't
do
much
more
than
a
private
citizen
would
have
a
right
to
do
under
any
circumstances.
he
went
in
and
identified
himself.
he
asked
if
he
could
go
onto
the
premises.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
that
was
found
to
be
consensual
because
it
was
not,
but
he
asked
to
go
on.
it
certainly
wasn't
forcible
entry.
and
under
those
circumstances
he
went
onto
the
yard.
okay?
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
the
legislature's
judgment
should
be
entitled
to
deference
just
as
a
judge's
judgment
regarding
the
execution
of
search
warrants
should
be
given
deference.
there
is
no
reason
that
this
court
should
desire
a
public
policy
that
would
require
police
to
be
timid
in
their
execution
of
search
warrants.
this
court,
of
course,
has
dealt
with
a
public
policy
called
the
exclusionary
rule
for
some
time.
the
question
is
is
whether
that
public
policy
should
be
such
so
that
police
officers
acting
in
good
faith
reliance
upon
the
existence
of
a
statute
should
have
evidence
that
is
seized
suppressed
in
court,
and
the
question
is
whether
that
public
policy
should
be
greater
than
a
public
policy
of,
for
example,
requiring
police
officers
to
enforce
statutes
as
they
know
them
to
be.
trial
courts
are
capable
of
answering
questions
which
arise
regarding
good
faith
reliance
on
statutes.
such
questions
as
whether
the
police
officer's
conduct
was
objectively
reasonable,
or
what
information
regarding
judicial
determinations
of
statutes
has
been
communicated
to
a
reasonably
well
trained
police
officer,
or
whether
a
police
officer
has
exceeded
the
scope
of
his
authority
granted
by
the
statute,
or
whether
the
statute--
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
he
said
that
he
did
not
feel
that
a
determination
regarding
good
faith
was
appropriate
because
he
felt
that
there
was
no
need
to
determine
whether
the
officer
was
acting
in
good
faith.
mr.
michael
j.
angarola
that's
correct.
yes,
your
honor.
no
finding
whatsoever.
citizens
have
greater
protections
against
constitutionally
defective
statutes
than
against
detective
warrants.
if
a
statute
is
enacted
that
may
be
unconstitutional,
an
injunction
can
be
obtained.
if
criminal
charges
occur
there
can
be
judicial
review
in
the
form
of
a
motion
to
suppress,
and
that
judicial
review
should
be
the
same,
i
would
think,
to
respond
to
justice
o'connor's
question,
whether
it
is
a
motion
to
suppress
that
is
filed
pursuant
to
a
search
that
occurred
regarding
a
statute
or
whether
that
is
regarding
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
citizens
can
express
their
views
to
legislatures.
proposed
legislation
can
be
reviewed
by
legislative
bodies
themselves.
they
can
be
reviewed
by
bar
association
committees.
they
can
be
viewed
by
the
governor
of
the
state,
and
in
illinois
the
governor
has
the
authority
to
mandatorily
veto
statutes.
thus
there
is
a
significant
amount
of
degree
of
review
of
proposed
legislation.
so
citizens
in
fact
have
more
avenue
of
redress
and
more
avenues
to
express
their
views
regarding
statutes
than
they
do
regarding
the
execution
of
a
search
warrant.
thus
we
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
opinion
of
the
illinois
supreme
court.
