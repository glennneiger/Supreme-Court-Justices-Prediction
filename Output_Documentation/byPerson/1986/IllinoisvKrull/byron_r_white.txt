justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
that
there
could
be
developments
in
constitutional
law
that
should
put
people
on
notice
that
a
particular
state
statute
is
a
very
questionable
piece
of
legislation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
there
had
been,
say,
a
decision
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
striking
down
a
very
similar
statute
in
wisconsin
i
would
think
maybe
the
police
ought
to
take
notice
of
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
think
we
should
just
disavow
footnote
8
in
leon,
or
do
you
think
we
have
to--
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
construction
of
footnote
8?
