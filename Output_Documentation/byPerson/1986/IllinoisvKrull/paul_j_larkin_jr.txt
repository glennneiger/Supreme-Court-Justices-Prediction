mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
outset
i
would
like
to
respond
to
some
questions
asked
by
justices
scalia
and
stevens.
there
were
no
findings
made
in
this
case
whether
or
not
detective
mcnally's
conduct
was
objectively
reasonable.
the
reason
was
both
the
trial
court
and
the
illinois
supreme
court
believed
they
were
not
allowed
to
make
those
types
of
findings
because
both
courts
concluded
that
the
good
faith
exception
that
this
court
adopted
in
leon
should
not
be
extended
to
this
context.
so,
since
they
decided
the
threshold
question
against
the
state
there
was
no
need
or
reason
for
them
to
go
on
and
make
these
types
of
findings,
but
they
wouldn't
have
to
be
findings
as
to
the
officer's
subjective
intent.
the
factors
that
go
into
the
determination
of
whether
something
is
reasonable
does
include
factors
such
as
the
length
of
time
the
statute
has
been
on
the
books,
the
number
and
types
of
challenges
that
have
been
brought
against
the
statute,
the
different
types
of
decisions
within
a
particular
state,
for
example,
or
within
a
particular--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--yes,
he
would,
your
honor,
because
whether
or
not
the
good
faith
exception
should
be
applied
in
an
individual
case--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--if
it
was
clear
that
it
was
objectively
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
be
acting
in
this
fashion,
there
would
be
less
of
a
likelihood
that
he
would
bring
a
suppression
motion.
however--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--no,
because
the
benefits
of
bringing
a
suppression
motion,
as
the
court
recognized
in
leon,
are
the
termination
of
the
case.
so
even
if
viewed
outside
the
judicial
system,
it
would
be
clear
that
a
judge
should
rule
in
the
government's
favor.
the
defense
counsel
is
not
going
to
be
certain
of
that
and
he
will
still
bring
his
motion,
but
in
addition,
in
statutes
like
this
you
have
the
possibility
of
challenging
the
statute
in
ways
that
you
don't
have
in
a
criminal
case.
for
example,
a
declaratory
judgment
proceeding
can
be
brought,
and
that
can
be
brought
early
on
and
before
the
searches
are
executed,
so
it
is
possible
to
have
the
substantive
rules
of
fourth
amendment
law
in
a
case
where
there
is
a
statute
rather
than
a
warrant
authorizing
the
conduct
to
be
clearly
defined
perhaps
even
before
any
search
occurs.
so
in
that
case
if
the
decision
is
clearly
settled
that
it
is
permissible
or
not,
then
you
have
an
entirely
different
type
of
calculus
that
goes
into
play.
the
two
substantive...
the
two
central
principles
that
this
court
adopted
in
leon
we
believe
control
this
case.
the
first
is
that
the
purpose
of
the
exclusionary
rule
is
to
deter
police
misconduct,
and
the
second
and
related
one
is
that
the
exclusionary
rule
will
not
serve
that
purpose
where
a
police
officer
acts
in
an
objectively
reasonable
fashion.
in
those
circumstances
the
officer
acts
as
any
other
officer
would,
and
imposing
the
remedy
of
exclusion
penalizes
the
officer
and
the
government
without
producing
any
corresponding
benefit
to
the
privacy
interest
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
although
the
question
in
this
case
involves
the
application
of
those
principles
that
were
adopted
in
leon
to
a
slightly
different
factual
situation,
we
believe
those
principles
are
fully
controlling
here.
that,
i
believe,
is
clear
when
you
look
at
the
question
from
the
perspective
of
the
officer
attempting
to
execute
the
search.
an
officer
in
making
the
decision
whether
an
arrest
or
a
search
is
lawful
is
concerned
about
the
substantive
rules
defining
his
conduct,
what
he
is
permitted
to
do
and
what
he
is
not
permitted
to
do.
he
is
not
as
concerned
about
who
authorizes
him
to
take
certain
actions.
in
this
respect
the
officer
will
be
indifferent
as
to
whether
it
is
a
magistrate
that
has
authorized
him
to
enter
this
business
or
whether
it
is
the
legislature
that
has.
he
will--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--there
are--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--there
are
circumstances
where
a
statute
is
clearly
unconstitutional
and
no
reasonable
person
should
believe
that
any
court
would
rule
otherwise.
a
specific
example,
i
suppose,
might
be
the
statute
in
the
torres
case,
but
where
a
legislature
has
made
a
reasonable
judgment,
and
the
legislature
is
required
to
make
an
independent
judgment
as
to
the
constitutionality
of
its
statutes,
if
it
is
reasonable
the
purposes
served
by
the
exclusionary
rule
will
not
be
served
by
suppressing
the
evidence
in
that
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
there
are
several
different
responses
that
i
can
give
to
that
question.
first,
in
terms
of
whether
the
officer
knows
about
it,
i
think
the
officer
should
be
deemed
to
know
of
a
decision
from
the
day
it
comes
down.
it
would
be
difficult
otherwise
to
define
any
particular
rule.
i
think
it
would
be
arbitrary
to
say
that
the
officer
is
entitled
to
30
days'
notice
before
his
actions
are
unlawful
or
otherwise.
but
whether
or
not
one
particular
decision
should
eliminate
any
argument
that
the
state
could
make
that
the
good
faith
exception
should
be
applicable
may
vary
from
case
to
case.
there
are
circumstances
where
there
may
be
a
variety
of
decisions
that
have
addressed
this
subject.
if
several
courts
have
invalidated
the
statute
and
several
courts
have
upheld
the
statute
it
may
be
reasonable
in
that
context.
this
is
the
same
type
of
inquiry
the
court
will
have
to
make
in
the
harlow
qualified
immunity
area
just
under
a
different
heading
whether
a
particular
constitutional
right
is
clearly
established.
so
that
type
of
factual
inquiry
can
vary,
but
here,
in
this
case
the
determination
of
unconstitutionality
was
made
not
until
after
the
search
was
conducted,
so
this
is
an
easy
case
for
the
application
of
the
good
faith--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
sort
of
circumstance
should
be
factored
into
the
second
half
of
the
inquiry
that
would
have
to
be
followed
in
this
case,
that
is,
whether
this
police
officer
acted
in
an
objectively
reasonable
manner,
but
the
threshold
question
of
whether
leon
should
at
all
be
applied
in
this
circumstance
we
believe
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
state.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
i
think
what
the
court
said
in
leon
was
that
in
undertaking
the
good
faith
exception,
in
adopting
the
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule
the
courts
were
adding
a
second
step
into
the
process
of
deciding
whether
evidence
should
be
suppressed.
under
the
court's
decisions
in
the
torres
case,
for
example,
since
the
statute
authorized
search
on
less
than
probable
cause
and
was
found
invalid
the
substantive
fourth
amendment
rule
in
that
case
is
that
that
type
of
search
cannot
go
forward,
but
if
the
good
faith
exception
is
applied
to
statutes,
as
we
submit
it
should,
the
next
inquiry
is
whether
or
not
the
police
officer
acted
reasonably
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
any
statute
that
said
the
latter,
your
honor,
should
be
held
unconstitutional
by
any
court.
but
i
would
not
say
that
our
argument
is
limited
just
to
administrative
search
inspections.
it
would
be
easier,
i
believe,
in
an
individual
case
to
establish
good
faith
where
the
statute
was
one
that
fit
into
the
administrative
search
exception,
but
our
argument
would
allow
the
prosecution
to
argue
that
reliance
on
any
type
of
statute
would
be
valid.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
as
we
construe
footnote
8
in
leon,
the
court
there
said
that
its
substantive
fourth
amendment
rulings
in
its
earlier
cases
were
not
affected
by
adoption
of
the
good
faith
exception,
but
that
the
good
faith
exception
would
require
the
courts
if
this
good
faith
were
applied
to
a
statutory
search
to
make
the
inquiry
whether
a
particular
search
was
reasonable.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is
because
they
all
preceded
this
court's
decision
in
leon
and
therefore
even
including
the
defillippo
case,
the
court
didn't
have
before
it
the
question
whether
or
not
if
a
good
faith
exception
should
be
adopted
it
should
be
applied
outside
the
context
of
a
search
warrant
in
the
context
of
a
search
authorized
by
a
statute.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
no,
i
wasn't
suggesting
the
court
wasn't
aware
of
this
type
of
problem,
but
it
is
just
that
until
the
court
decided
leon
the
court
didn't
have
the
opportunity
to
decide
how
this
type
of
exception
should
be
applied
outside
the
context
of
a
search
warrant.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
a
case--
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
--as
i
remember
the
facts
of
that
case
there
probably
wasn't
a
majority
to
hold
it
unconstitutional,
even
though
there
was
some
indication
that
it
probably
would
have
been
held
unconstitutional
because
there
was
a
majority
of
the
judges
sitting
on
the
case.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
so
i
think
it
is
a
case
where
the
good
faith
exception
would
not
have
applied,
but
i
think
this
is
a
case
where
the
good
faith
exception
should
reasonably
be
applied.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
well,
i
am
not
sure
what
number
of
cases...
how
great
that
number
of
cases
might
be.
the
same
sort
of
problem,
for
example,
is
going
to
arise
in
the
question
of
qualified
immunity,
and
so
if
a
police
officer
conducts
a
search
under
a
statute
and
is
thereafter
sued
for
damages,
the
same
sort
of
problem
would
arise.
mr.
paul
j.
larkin,
jr.
it
is
not
necessarily
double
it.
it
is
a
different
type
of
inquiry,
but
i
don't
know
if
it
is
necessarily
going
to
increase
the
burdens
on
the
courts,
but
even
if
it
does,
i
think
there
are
reasonable
benefits
to
the
prosecution
from
allowing
this
type
of
inquiry.
