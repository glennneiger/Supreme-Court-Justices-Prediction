justice
antonin
scalia
how
would
you
go
about
demonstrating
good
faith?
wouldn't
you
assert
that
you
would
carry
your
burden
simply
by
showing
that
the
officer
was
acting
pursuant
to
a
statute
that
was
on
the
books
and
that
had
not
been
stricken
down,
that
had
been
on
the
books
in
illinois
since
when,
1933?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
what
more
would
you
want
to
show
good
faith,
that
nobody
had
told
him
it
was
unconstitutional?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
illinois
supreme
court
speak
to
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
rested
entirely
on
the
fact
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
and
therefore
the
search,
even
if
it
was
within
the
scope,
was
no
good.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
court
below
had
found
that
he
wasn't
within
his
scope,
wrongfully,
you
say,
but
that's
what
it
had
found.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
can
we
find
that
it
was,
that
it
was
within
the
scope
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
seems
silly
to
me--
justice
antonin
scalia
--and
it
may
seem
silly
to
you,
but
surely
that
is
a
matter
of
illinois
law,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
illinois
is
entitled
to
have
a
silly
law
if
it
wants.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
giving
us
a
lot
more
litigation
in
all
of
this,
aren't
you?
i
mean,
we
are
going
to
have
to
decide
in
every
case
not
only
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional
now
but
how
badly
unconstitutional
is
it.
is
it
so
badly
unconstitutional
that
everybody
should
know
it?
i
mean,
the
first
call
is
hard
enough.
we
are
going
to
have
to
make
a
double
one
all
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
i
am
not
particularly
happy
about
that.
you
are
just
saying
let's
double
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
illinois
supreme
court
reject
the
contention
that
he
went
beyond
the
scope
of...
that
he
was
within
the
scope
of
the
search
that
the
statute
allowed?
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
didn't
address
that
at
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
asking
whether
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
rejected
the
notion
that
it
was
a
consent
search.
that
is
not
it.
it
is
whether,
assuming
that
it
wasn't
a
consent
search,
did
it
nonetheless
go
beyond
the
scope
of
what
the
statute
would
have
allowed
without
consent.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
asking
whether
they
admitted
that
the
lower
court
had
decided
it.
i
am
asking
whether
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
said
anything
about
it.
did
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
decide
that
point?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
didn't
say
anything
about
that
point.
they
didn't
find
it
necessary
to
reach
it,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
both
of
those
cases
draw
the
distinction.
does
either
of
them
give
a
reason
for
the
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
note
that
we
allow
this
good
faith
exception
where
you
have
a
substantive
statute
that
is
later
found
unconstitutional
and
the
search
is
in
order
to
enforce
the
substantive
statute
you
can
have
a
good
faith
exception,
they
say,
but
that
is
not
the
same
thing
as
a
statute
which
is
not
a
substantive
statute
but
a
search
statute.
now,
that
is
a
nice
distinction.
did
they
give
any
reason
for
the
distinction?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
another
distinction.
that
is
not
a
reason
why
in
the
one
case
it
makes
sense
to
apply
a
good
faith
exclusionary
rule,
a
good
faith
exception
to
the
exclusionary
rule,
and
the
other
one
there
isn't.
you
are
just
giving
me
another
distinction.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
what
is
the
reason
why
that
distinction
should
have
some
bearing
upon
whether
you
allow
a
good
faith
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
done
so
in
the
other
case,
too,
where
it
has
a
substantive
statute
that
is
beyond
its
power,
and
it
is
having
its
law
officers
enforce
a
statute
that
it
has
no
authority
to
enforce,
a
substantive
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
a
distinction.
what
i
am
asking,
what
i
am
trying
to
find
is
a
reason
why
that
distinction
should
make
a
difference
as
to
whether
a
good
faith
exception
should
be
applied.
it
is
just
like
saying
one
is
black
and
the
other
one
is
blue.
well,
that
is
fine,
but
why
should
that
have
any
bearing
upon
whether
you
allow
a
good
faith
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
abrogates
the
constitution
every
time
it
passes
an
unconstitutional
law,
whether
it
is
substantively
unconstitutional
or
an
unconstitutional
search
law.
both
of
them
are
bad.
both
of
them
are
wicked,
if
you
will,
but
why
does
that
have
any
bearing
upon
whether
you
allow
a
good
faith
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
probable
cause
because
the
statute
seems
to
him
to
be
constitutional,
even
though
it
really
isn't.
you
can
say
the
same
in
the
other
situation
where
he
is
proceeding
under
a
statute
that
authorizes
a
search.
there
is
probable
cause
to
believe
that
is
constitutional,
too.
is
there
something
in
the
function
of
the
good
faith
exception
that
makes
it
more
dangerous
to
apply
it
in
one
situation
than
in
the
other?
that
is
what
i
am
looking
for.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it
has
also
been
applied
in
the
context
of
a
substantive
statute
where
the
substantive
statute
under
which
the
officer
is
operating
is
found
to
be
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
difference
would
it
make?
you
mean
so
long
as
the
mistake
about
the
statute
is
made
by
a
magistrate
before
it
is
made
by
the
officer
it
is
all
right
even
though
the
underlying
mistake
is
not
the
mistake
of
the
magistrate
but
of
the
legislature?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
statute
is
unconstitutional.
that
is
the
only
thing
wrong
with
it,
right?
the
statute
under
which
he
is
acting
is
unconstitutional.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
this
one,
the
other
situation,
the
defillippo
type
situation.
