justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
a
question
about
the
illinois
supreme
court's
action
in
this
case?
is
it
not
correct
that
by
the
time
the
case
reached
the
illinois
supreme
court
judge
schader's
order
in
the
federal
court
had
already
been
vacated
and
set
aside,
and
so
the
supreme
court
of
illinois
had
to
make
its
own
determination
of
the
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute.
it
didn't
just
rely
on
the
federal
decision,
but
it
was
in
this
very
case
that
the
statute
was
held
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
didn't?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
its
opinion
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
was
it
doing
at
pages
10
to
17
of
its
opinion?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
is
controlling
that
the
decision
that
caused
this
statute
to
be
held
unconstitutional
was
made
by
the
illinois
supreme
court
in
this
very
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
the
question,
what
you
are
really
asking
us
to
do
is
to
say
not
to
apply
the
exclusionary
rule
in
the
case
in
which
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
itself
is
challenged
and
found
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
there
any
findings
on
that
issue
on
this
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
you
didn't
discharge
your
burden
of
proof.
isn't
that
the
end
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
as
i
understand
it,
your
opponent
takes
the
position
that
the
search
went
beyond
that
authorized
by
the
statute,
and
you
would
at
least,
it
seems
to
me,
have
to
have
findings
that
the
search
was
that
which
would
have
been
authorized
pursuant
to
this
statute,
and
there
is
no
such
finding.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
very
silly.
that
is
not
right
at
all.
all
they
would
have
to
do,
i
suppose,
is
go
get
a
warrant
once
they
found
they
didn't
have
the
records
the
statute
required,
and
they
also
are
in
violation
of
the
statute
by
not
having
the
records.
that
is
not
so
silly,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
isn't
there
some
sanction
for
not
having
the
books
and
records?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
the
statute
contain
a
sanction
for
not
having
the
required
books
and
records?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
not
a
silly
sanction,
is
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mentioning
the
challenges,
mr.
larkin,
if
you
prevail
in
this
case
would
a
defendant
in
a
case
like
this
ever
have
any
motive
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
assuming
the
facts
clearly
show
good
faith
on
the
part
of
the
officer,
then
he
would
have
no
motive
to
challenge
the
statute,
would
he?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
really
be
no
point
in
it,
would
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
at
the
time
that
footnote
was
written
the
subject
of
the
good
faith
exception
had
been
before
the
court
in
various
ways
for
two
or
three
years
at
least
by
1983.
we
hadn't
actually
decided
until
leon,
but
it
had
been
raised
several
times,
but
not
squarely
presented
and
therefore
decided,
so
it
wasn't
as
though
it
wasn't
something
we
would
think
about.
justice
john
paul
stevens
going
back
for
a
minute
to
the
torres
case,
were
you
saying
that
is
a
case
where
it
was
so
obvious
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
that
the
police
officer
should
have
known
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
even
though
the
puerto
rico
supreme
court
had
held
it
constitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
