chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-608,
illinois
versus
krull.
mr.
angarola,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
angarola.
we
will
hear
now
from
your
mr.
larkin.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so
your
distinction
is
between
a
statute
which,
a
colonnada
type
statute
which
authorizes
inspection
and
search
of
a
heavily
regulated
business
on
the
one
hand
and
a
statute
which
simply
says,
from
now
on
you
can
search
without
probable
cause?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
larkin.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
miquelon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
miquelon,
what
if
a
state
enacted
a
statute
providing
that
the
following
circumstances
shall
constitute
exigent
circumstances
for
purposes
of
making
arrests
or
searching,
and
then
defined
a
number
of
situations
which,
you
know,
probably
a
lot
of
them
would
qualify
as
exigent
circumstances
under
decided
cases,
but
there
was
one
in
there
that
a
court
held
this
just
doesn't
qualify
as
an
exigent
circumstance
under
the
fourth
amendment.
now,
do
you
think
the
good
faith
rule
would
be
out
with
that
kind
of
a
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
do
you
think
it
is
beyond
the
capacity
of
congress
or
the
illinois
legislature
to
say
these
shall
be
exigent
circumstances?
do
you
think
courts
should
pay
no
attention
to
a
statute
like
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
even
though
this
court
has
recognized
a
class
of
situations,
heavily
regulated,
licensed
businesses
which
can
be
examined
and
perhaps
searched
without
a
warrant,
if
a
legislature
makes
the
slightest
mistake
under
our
cases
in
saying
this
is
a
heavily
regulated
business,
the
good
faith
rule
doesn't
apply?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
under
your
analysis
i
understood
it
was
kind
of
a
black
and
white
thing.
it
doesn't
depend
on
the
law
being
slightly
unconstitutional
or
very
unconstitutional.
if
it
is
unconstitutional,
period,
the
good
faith
exception
can't
be
applied.
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
miquelon.
mr.
angarola,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
angarola.
the
case
is
submitted.
