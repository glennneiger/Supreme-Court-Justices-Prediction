doesn't
colorado
or
california's
efforts
here
go
beyond
protecting
or
preventing
the
indians
from
offering
this
service
or
marketing
this
gambling
to
non-indians?
you
want
them
to
quit
entirely?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
california
want
to
do
to
these
bingo
games?
they
want
to
stop
them
unless
they
are
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
the
indians
said,
all
we
want
to
do
is
have
a
bingo
game
for
indians.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
were
still
insisting
that
you
had
the
right
to
regulate
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
california
law
on
its
face
would
prevent
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
argument
is,
well,
really,
this
is
just
indians
dealing
with
a
non-indian
situation,
and
if
you
can
keep
them
from
selling
cigarettes
to
non-indians
you
ought
to
be
able
to
keep
the
non-indians
out
of
their
bingo
game.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
doesn't
that
law
say
unless
the
state
permits
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
else
would
there
be
gambling
in
any
state
with
these
devices?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask
you,
does
this
tribe...
is
this
tribe
required
to
submit
any
of
its
ordinances
or
laws,
tribal
laws
to
the
secretary?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
were
approved
pursuant
to
an
authority
the
secretary
has,
expressly
has?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
your
management
contract
required
to
be
presented
to
the
secretary?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
your
ordinance
wasn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
if
the
secretary
withdrew
his
approval
of
your
management
contract
in
order
to
get
around
that
you
would
have
to
get
his
decision
overturned
in
court,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
which
event
you
would
have
to
present
another
management
contract,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
state
know
you
were
submitting
to
the
secretary
those
ordinances
and
the
management
contract
for
approval?
did
they
oppose
it,
or
did
they
even
know
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
i
wanted
the
best
place
i
would
suppose
that
they
might
have
opposed
this
administrative
decision
to
permit
it,
but
they
didn't,
anyway.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
they
say
there
is
a
real
danger.
that
is
what
they
say.
justice
byron
r.
white
they
didn't
say
there
was
no
danger,
did
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
they
say
there
was
no
danger?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
ninth
circuit.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
didn't
say
there
was
any
danger.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
is
the
state's
whole
point.
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
district
courts
or
all
in
the
ninth
circuit
or
the
fifth?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
state
had
an
age
limitation
that
nobody
under
16
may
gamble
at
bingo?
could
they
enforce
that
on
the
reservation?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
be...
the
tribe
would
be
the...
if
they
said
18
and
the
state
16,
it
would
be
the
tribal
rule
that
would
govern.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
everybody
that
the
bingo
game
hires
is
subject
to
fbi
approval?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no
management
agreement.
as
justice
stevens
says,
they
just
hire
him
week
by
week.
they
say
come
on
and
come
to
work
for
us,
just
like
a
waitress
or
anything
else.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
the
attorney
general's
office
or
the...
who
enforces
this
law,
this
lottery
law,
california
lottery
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
they've
got
a
lot
to
do.
who...
it
must
be
that
people
complain
to
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
whom
does
it
make
any
difference
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
whom
do
you
think...
you
must
have
some
idea
who
is
complaining
about
these
indian
lotteries.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
just
an
energetic
local
prosecutor
in
riverside
county?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
the
tribal
games.
justice
byron
r.
white
who
is
complaining
about
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
but
they
just
don't
do
it
on
their
own,
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
must...
a
lot
of
them
are
elected,
aren't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
part
of
his
constituency
is
complaining?
charities?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
really--
justice
byron
r.
white
--there
is
competition.
there
is
real
competition,
isn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
wouldn't
think
a
local
prosecutor
would
get
so
excited
unless
there
might
be
a
question
of
votes
or
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
from
the
charities.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
cabazon
case
which
is
here
from
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
we
affirm
the
judgment
of
that
court
and
remand
the
case.
justice
stevens
has
filed
the
dissenting
opinion;
justices
o'connor
and
scalia
have
joined
that
opinion.
