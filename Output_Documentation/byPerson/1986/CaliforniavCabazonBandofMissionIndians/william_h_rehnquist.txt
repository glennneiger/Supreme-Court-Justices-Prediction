chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
85-1708,
california
versus
cabazon
band
of
mission
indians.
mr.
walston,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
the
record
show
how
many
participants
there
are
in
a
game
where
there's
a
$100,000
prize?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
don't
the
tribes
claim
that
they
regulate
the
games?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
true...
if
you
think
of
tribal
sovereignty
as
compared
to
state
sovereignty,
california
wouldn't
regulate
the
same
way
that
arizona
does.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
the
government
filed
a
brief
on
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--the
ninth
circuit,
perhaps
not
on
the
most
strong
evidence
in
the
world,
said
that
there
had
been
a
tradition
of
indian
gambling
for
a
long
time,
didn't
they,
in
their
opinion?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
one
reason
the
state
approves
and
regulates
horseracing
is
that
it
gets
a
lot
of
revenue.
now,
is
that
true
of
its
regulation
of
bingo,
too?
does
it
get
any
revenue
from
bingo
games
that
are
conducted
in
compliance
with
its
laws?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walston.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
feldman.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
the
case
of
the
tribe
with
only
nine
adult
members
i
suppose
the
tribe
also
has
an
interest
in
opening
it
to
the
general
public.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
really
get
into
some
hairsplitting
about,
you
know,
whether
something
is
prohibited
or
whether
it
is
regulated.
witness
some
of
justice
holmes'
comments
in
the
common
law.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
people
drive
70
or
80
miles
then
to
play
this
game
if
they
do
that
when
they
could
just
drive
a
couple
miles
to
a
charitable
game
closer
to
home?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
on
what
legislation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
didn't
pass?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
for
whatever
reason
it
didn't
pass.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
all
bryan
held
was
that
a
tax
statute
couldn't
be
applied
in
itasca
county.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
california
prohibits
the
intentional
taking
of
a
human
life
but
allows
it
in
the
case
of
self-defense.
does
that
mean
intentional
killing
is
prohibited
or
regulated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
good.

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
feldman.
mr.
walston,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
walston.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
on
no.
85-1708,
california
versus
cabazon
band
of
mission
indians,
and
no.
85-6461,
martin
against
ohio
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
