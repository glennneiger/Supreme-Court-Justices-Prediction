justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
a
question--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--mr.
walston?
i
understood
you
to
say
that
you
didn't
think
the
department
of
interior
supported
the
indians'
position,
but--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--how
do
you
read
the
affidavit
by
mr.
krenzke,
page
219
of
the
joint
appendix?
this
gentleman
says
he
is
the
director
of
indian
services,
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
department
of
the
interior.
you
have
seen
the
affidavit,
of
course.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
think
that
does
not
represent
the
view
of
the
department
of
the
interior?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
just
ask
this
question?
you
mentioned
and
your
brief
also
mentions
organized
crime
and
the
danger
of
infiltration.
is
there
any
evidence
that
organized
crime
has
infiltrated
the
bingo
operations
of
the
tribes
that
are
before
us?
any
evidence
in
this
record?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
maybe
i
had
better
withdraw
the
question
then,
but
you
argue
in
your
brief
that
that
is
a
concern
of
the
state
of
california.
