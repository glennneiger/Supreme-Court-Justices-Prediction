mr.
walston,
is
the
prevention
of
organized
crime
infiltration
the
only
state
interest
in
controlling
gambling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
do
you
allege
there
is
any
other
state
interest
in
placing
limits
on
the
games
as
you
have
no
more
than
$250
in
a
bingo
game
and
a
lot
of
other
things
that
are
illegal
gambling?
is
there
any
state
interest
in
those
laws
that
is
implicated
other
than
trying
to
prevent
organized
crime
from
coming
into
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
to
keep
organized
crime
out?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
historically
that
has
been
the
only
basis
for
state
prohibition
or
regulation
of
gambling,
is
to
keep
organized
crime
out
of
the
business?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
has
been
a
long
time
that
gambling
was
considered
contrary
to
public
policy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
just
happened
to
think
of
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
mr.
feldman,
is
that
fair...
if
you
just
put
a
$250
limit
on
the
game
they
wouldn't
want
to
shut
you
down,
would
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
who
are
allowed?
who
are
those
who
are
allowed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
that
is
sort
of
hypothetical
anyway,
because
i
don't
imagine
the
tribes
would
want
games
unless
they
could
attract
non-indians
onto
the
reservation,
would
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
with
reference
to
recreational
services
on
the
reservation,
what
if
the
services
were
the
opportunity
to
consume
drugs
on
the
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
the
activity
of
bingo
at
more
than
250
jackpots
prohibited
by
the
state?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
it
hold
that?
mr.
feldman,
supposing
a
state
authorized
prostitution
subject
to
certain
regulation.
if
they
regulated
it,
then
it
would
be...
you
could
have
it
on
an
indian
reservation
unregulated
under
your
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
i
am
just
assuming
the
only...
that
there
is
a
state
regulation
of
the
activity,
not
a
total
prohibition,
as
i
presume
there
is
in
nevada,
that
in
that
state
the
indian
tribes
could
operate
unregulated
under
your
theory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
didn't
say
local
option.
i
said
they
permit
it
throughout
the
state
but
they
regulate
it.
they
have
certain
health
regulations
and
one
thing
and
another.
but
you
would
say
on
the
tribe
it
could
go
forward
unregulated.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
analogy
to
the
bingo...
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
let
me
ask
you
this
then.
supposing
we
had
a
change
of
administration.
you
got
a
different
secretary
of
interior
who
thought
gambling
was
morally
wrong
and
prohibited
it.
would
you
no
longer
have
a
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
no
longer
be
able
to
operate
if
the
secretary
of
interior
had
a
different
view
about
the
propriety
of
gambling?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--do
you
think
the
state
has
an
interest
in
regulating
the
kind
of
disclosure
that
is
made
to
prospective
customers?
0
[generallaughter.]
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
feldman,
you
said
the
fbi
could
come
in
if
there
was
any
organized
crime
problem,
but
what
if
a
tribe
hired
a
person
that
the
fbi
thought
was
affiliated
with
organized
crime
to
manage
the
bingo
game?
what
could
the
fbi
do
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
an
oral
contracts.
they
don't
write
anything
out,
they
just
hire
him
to
run
the
game
and
hire
and
fire
personnel.
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
the
security
people
that
were
to
protect
the
customers
from
robbery
and
the
like
were
all
employed
and
the
fbi
thought
they
were
all
persons
associated
with
organized
crime.
could
they
do
anything
about
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
the
tribe
could
decide
whether
or
not
to
follow
their
advice.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
am
just...
you
indicated
earlier,
i
thought,
that
the
fbi
had
the
power
to
take...
to
solve
this
problem,
and
i
think
all
they
could
do
is
recommend,
if
i
understand
you
correctly.
