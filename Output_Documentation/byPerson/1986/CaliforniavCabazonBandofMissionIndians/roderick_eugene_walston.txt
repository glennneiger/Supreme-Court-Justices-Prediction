mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
state
laws
prohibiting
high
stakes
gambling
are
applicable
to
tribal
gambling
operations,
most
of
which
feature
bingo.
the
question
as
we
see
it
breaks
down
into
two
major
questions:
first,
whether
state
gambling
laws
are
applicable
under
the
balancing
test
that
this
court
has
established
in
past
indian
law
cases,
which
has
often
been
referred
to
as
a
form
of
federal
common
law.
the
second
question
is
whether
state
gambling
laws
are
applicable
here
under
public
law
280,
which
of
course
is
a
federal
statute.
before
beginning
my
argument
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
our
main
argument
before
the
court.
our
view
is
that
four
major
factors
support
state
jurisdiction
here
as
those
factors
are
relevant
under
the
balancing
test,
and
i
would
like
to
briefly
mention
them.
first,
in
our
view
the
tribal
games
here
are
successful
primarily
because
they
are
illegal
under
california
law
in
that
they
allow
non-indians
to
play
high
stakes
bingo
in
circumvention
of
state
law,
and
therefore
the
value
of
the
games
essentially
derives
from
restrictions
that
the
state
places
against
its
own
non-indian
citizens.
second,
the
states,
not
indian
tribes,
have
traditionally
regulated
gambling.
therefore
the
activity
in
this
case
falls
within
the
traditional
province
of
states,
not
indian
tribes,
and
therefore
as
we
view
it
the
principal
of
tribal
sovereignty
is
not
implicated
in
this
case.
third,
the
federal
government
does
not
in
any
way
regulate
or
supervise
these
games.
they
are
wholly
unregulated.
fourth,
because
of
the
high
stakes
and
lack
of
regulation
the
tribal
games
create
in
our
view
a
serious
risk
of
infiltration
by
organized
criminal
elements.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
high
stakes
is,
under
california
law
is
anything
that
exceeds
$250.
under
california
law
charitable
bingo
operations
can
be
conducted
on
a
low
stakes
basis,
and
low
stakes
are
defined
as
anything
not
exceeding
$250.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
think
that...
i
would
imagine
that
that
is
still
fairly
low
stakes,
certainly
considering
the
type
of
tribal
stakes
that
are
involved
here.
for
example,
one
of
the
tribes
has
maximum
stakes
of
$15,000.
another
tribe
in
california
has
a
maximum
stake--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
per
game.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
one
tribal
bingo
game
featuring
one
card,
and
the
prizes,
of
course,
vary
from
reservation
to
reservation,
but
some
tribes...
in
this
case--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--yes,
that
is
correct.
there
is
a
$15,000
maximum
prize
under
the
marango
games.
another
tribe
in
california,
and
this
is
in
the
record,
has
a
maximum
stake
of
$100,000.
so
the
prizes
here
are
very
high,
and
yet
when
you
compare
that
with
the
$250
limit
of
charitable
bingo
that
is
authorized
under
state
law
you
see
the
disparity
between
the
games
that
are
authorized
and
the
games
that
are
not.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
it
doesn't
show
that
with
respect
to
the
$100,000,
but
we
do
know
that
the
bingo
parlor
conducted
by
the
cabazon
band
has
a
seating
capacity
of
500
people.
a
state
investigator
visiting
the
bingo
parlor
on
one
occasion
in
1984
observed
approximately
300
people.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
we
don't
have
that
information
but
i
do
think
the
record
shows
that
the
average
player
in
one
of
the
bingo
games
in
southern
california
spends
on
the
average
$84
per
person.
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
that
is
the
average
amount
of
outlay
per
player
for
one
night
at
that
particular
operation.
our
conclusion
from
the
four
factors
that
if
these
games
are
legalized
they
should
be
regulated
and
therefore
the
conclusion
as
we
view
it
is
that
if
there
is
to
be
bingo
by
the
indian
tribes
here
the
authorization
must
come
from
congress.
congress
has
the
power
to
impose
regulations
upon
these
games.
until
congress
does
that
we
think
it
is
impermissible
for
this
court
to
uphold
the
games
in
their
present
form.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
tribes
claim
that
but
in
actuality
we
feel
that
there
is
no
regulation
at
all.
each
tribe
makes
its
own
decision
in
terms
of
how
the
games
are
operated.
there
is
no
uniform
federal
standard
that
applies.
the
secretary
of
interior
does
not
regulate
the
games.
there
is
no
uniform
intertribal
standard
that
applies.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that's
true.
we
don't
view
indian
tribes
as
having
the
same
relation
to
the
state
as
other
states
do.
certainly
the
sovereignty
of
the
states
is
spelled
out
in
the
tenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
this
court,
on
the
other
hand,
has
held
that
tribal
sovereignty
depends
upon
a
balance
of
competing
interests,
the
balance
of
competing
tribal,
federal,
and
state
interests.
therefore
we
don't
view
the
situations
as
analogous.
one
of
the
tribes
in
this
case,
for
example,
has
only
25
members,
and
it
is
difficult
for
us
to
imagine
that
an
indian
tribe
with
25
members
can
be
equated
with,
say,
the
sovereign
state
of
california
or,
for
that
matter,
any
other
sovereign
state.
they
just
don't
have
the
ingredients
of
law
enforcement
techniques
that
the
states
have
in
trying
to
prevent
the
intrusion
of
organized
crime.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
don't
believe
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
our
understanding
is
that
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
guidelines
for
the
approval
of
management
contracts.
in
other
words,
if
an
indian
tribe
signs
a
contract
with
a
non-indian
operator,
and
if
the
tribe
voluntarily
submits
the
contract
to
the
secretary
for
his
approval,
then
under
those
circumstances
the
secretary
does
apply
the
guidelines,
but
of
course--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--i
am
not
entirely
sure
that
that
is
true,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
is
a
pronounced--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
we
don't.
i
think
there
is
a
pronounced
ambivalence
in
the
federal
attitude
with
respect
to
the
tribal
games
here.
certainly
there
are
elements
in
the
federal
government
that
basically
support
the
tribal
games
but
they
don't
regulate
the
games.
they
provide
support
in
the
sense
that
they
will
approve
tribal
ordinances
that
are
submitted
to
them
for
approval
but
otherwise
there
is
no
regulation,
and
other
agencies
of
the
federal
government
i
understand
are
much
less
sympathetic
to
the
type
of
tribal
activity
here.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
there
was
an
indian
bingo
bill
or
an
indian
gambling
bill
that
passed
the
house
and
then
passed
a
senate
select
committee,
but
it
was
not
approved
on
the
floor
of
the
house
and
as
far
as
we
understand--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
yes,
but
there
was
more
to
it
than
that.
i
understand
that
there
was
strong
opposition
on
the
floor
of
the
senate
to
the
bill
and
also--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--yes,
it
would
have.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
it
would
have
provided
both
for
authorization
and
for
regulation.
in
fact,
i
should
add,
your
honor,
that
the
department
of
justice
commented
on
the
bill
and
stated
that
the
bill
did
not
go
far
enough
n
establishing
regulatory
safeguards.
in
fact,
it
called
the
bill
an
anti-law
enforcement
device
that
failed
to
adequately
protect
against
the
intrusion
of
organized
crime
on
indian
reservations.
so,
it
appears,
as
i
say,
that
there
is
an
ambivalence--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--no,
the
federal
government
has
not,
and
i
think
that
the
failure
of
the
federal
government
to
file
a
brief
in
this
case
speaks
volumes
concerning
the
ambivalence
of
the
federal
position
in
this
case.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
did...
i
am
sorry.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
i
understand
that
the
interior
department
supported
the
bill.
the
justice
department
opposed
it,
and
the
views
of
the
president,
i
understand,
were
closer
to
those
of
the
justice
department
than
interior,
but
the
important
thing
is
that
the
bill,
regardless
of
what
form
it
came
out
of
congress
in,
would
have
provided
for
the
kind
of
regulation
and
control
that
is
not
present
with
respect
to
the
tribal
games
here,
and
that
is
the
key
points.
our
view
all
along
has
been
that
there
is
an
argument
to
be
made
for
tribal
bingo,
but
the
games
should
not
be
legalized
unless
they
are
adequately
regulated,
and
we
don't
have
the
adequate
regulatory
controls
at
this
time.
therefore,
for
that
reason--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--pardon?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
i
think
i
said
the
opposite.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
i
am
familiar
with
the
affidavit.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
i...
perhaps
your
honor
misunderstood
me
or
perhaps
i
misspoke,
but
i
thought
what
i
said
was
that
interior
basically
supported
the
indian
gambling
bill
and
supported
the
tribal
activities
here
but
the
justice
department
apparently
as
far
as
we
know
feels
differently,
so
the
ambivalence
in
the
federal
position
is
between
interior
and
justice.
that
was
the
point
i
meant
to
make.
justice
blackmun?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that's...
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement.
i
think
that
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
tribal
games
here
do
indeed
provide
for
large
revenues
for
a
number
of
tribal
programs,
and
we
certainly
concede
that.
there
are
some
responses
to
that.
first,
the
tribes
have
an
interest
only
in
the
revenue,
but
they
don't
have
an
interest
in
the
activity
involved
here.
they
don't
have
an
interest,
a
sovereign
tribal
interest
in
the
subject
of
high
stakes
gambling.
high
stakes
gambling
has
never
played
a
part
of
indian
historical
development.
it
is
not
indigenous
to
tribal
culture
or
custom.
it
is
not
a
traditional
indian
practice.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
the
ninth
circuit
didn't
say
that,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
the
ninth
circuit
said
that
the
tribes
had
a
sovereign
interest
in
raising
revenue
and
that
that
was
a
traditional
government
function,
and
that
therefore
the
tribes
as
we...
as
i
understand
it
the
tribes
should
therefore
be
allowed
to
raise
revenue
by
any
type
of
activity
at
all,
and
therein
lies
the
difference,
one
of
the
major
differences
between
the
ninth
circuit
and
us.
our
view
is
that
although
the
tribes
do
indeed
have
an
economic
interest
it
is
crucial
that
this
court
focus
upon
the
activity
that
provides
that
revenue,
for
this
court
has
always
looked
to
the
activity
of
indian
tribes,
not
their
revenue
raising
interest,
in
determining
whether
the
principle
of
tribal
sovereignty
applies.
and
indeed
the
court
did
this
very
recently
in
the
case
of
rice
versus
rehner.
yes?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
not
in
the
record.
to
fully
answer
your
question,
justice
powell,
i
would
have
to
go
outside
the
record,
and
i
am
reluctant
to
do
that.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
the
possibility
that
the
bingo
operations
may
be
taken
over
by
organized
crime
is
a
very
serious
concern
to
the
state
of
california.
we
did,
by
the
way,
concede
below
that
we
do
not
allege...
"we
do
not
allege"
the
existence
of
organized
crime
in
this
cases.
we
have
never
conceded
that
organized
crime
may
or
may
not
be
involved
in
this
case.
but
our
view
is
that
california
law
is
intended
to
prevent
organized
criminal
infiltration
before
it
takes
place
rather
than
simply
eradicate
a
criminal
operation
after
it
has
actually
occurred.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
since
1983,
march,
1983.
essentially
most
of
the
tribal
bingo
operations
that
are
proliferating
nationally
have
taken
place
as
a
result
of
a
1982
decision
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
seminole
tribes
case.
so
the
phenomenon
before
this
court
is
a
fairly
recent
one,
but
going
back
to
the
organized
crime
question,
the
president's
commission
on
organized
crime
recently
noted
that
gambling,
second
only
to
drugs,
is
a
major
source
of
income
for
organized
crime.
the
national
gambling
review
commission,
which
was
established
by
congress
to
study
the
links
between
gambling
and
organized
crime
concluded
that
high
stakes
bingo
does
indeed
attract
organized
crime
because
of
the
large
amounts
of
cash
that
are
involved.
and
that
commission,
a
congressionally
established
commission,
recommended
that
the
only
effective
way
to
prevent
organized
criminal
infiltration
with
respect
to
bingo
games
is
for
the
states
to
provide
for
adequate
regulation
and
control
of
the
games.
the
california
attorney
general
task
force
issued
a
report
in
1971
in
the
same
vein,
and
the
attorney
general
task
force
noted
the
experience
of
new
york.
new
york
in
the
late
1950s
legalized
bingo.
the
games
were
quickly
taken
over
by
organized
criminal
elements
and
new
york
was
able
to
regain
control
only
by
establishing
and
enforcing
stringent
limitations.
therefore
our
view
is
that
state
regulation
of
gambling
is
the
main
bulwark
against
organized
criminal
infiltration,
but
under
the
view
being
asserted
by
the
tribes
today
that
bulwark
is
not
present
with
respect
to
the
tribal
games
here.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
that
is
true,
justice
o'connor.
if
interior
adopted
regulations
presumably
the
regulations
would
be
effective
in
resolving
or
at
least
reducing
the
organized
crime
problem,
and
to
the
extent
that
the
regulations
would
have
that
effect,
than
many
of
the
concerns
that
i
have
expressed
today
would
be
mitigated.
to
date
congress
has
not
acted.
congress
has
not
acted.
the
secretary
of
the
interior
has
not
acted.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
has
california?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
california
has
indeed
recommended
passage
of
on
of
the
indian
gambling
bills
subject
to
stringent
regulations,
and
i
should
add
that
california
did
not
recommend
adoption
of
the
bill
that
passed
the
house
and
that
passed
the
senate
select
committee
because
california
felt,
as
does
the
department
of
justice,
that
that
bill
does
not
go
far
enough
to
prevent
organized
criminal
infiltration.
california
instead
recommended
a
bill
which
had
been
propounded
by
the
administration
that
went
much
further
in
that
direction.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
the
other
interest,
justice
stevens,
is
that
the
success
of
the
tribal
games,
as
i
mentioned
at
the
outset,
depends
upon
their
illegality
under
california
law,
and
that
they
allow
non-indians
to
play
bingo,
high
stakes
bingo
in
violation
of
state
law.
and
thus
the
very
raison
d'etre
of
the
games
is
to
attract
non-indians
to
come
on
the
reservations
to
play
the
games,
in
circumvention
of
state
law,
and
thus
in
our
view
the
games
themselves
have
no
truly
intrinsic
value.
rather,
their
value
derives
from
restrictions
that
the
state
places
against
its
own
non-indian
citizens.
the
state,
as
it
were,
has
created
the
market
that
the
tribes
are
trying
to
exploit,
and
the
tribes
are
taking
commercial
advantage
of
california
law
by
marketing
to
non-indians
the
very
high
stakes
gambling
that
california
law
prohibits.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
that
is
the
major
interest
that
california
has
in
placing
limits
on
charitable
bingo.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
our
view
is
that
if
the
low
stakes
limits
were
eliminated
and
if
charitable
organizations
were
allowed
to
hire
outside
operators
rather
than
conduct
the
games
themselves,
then
under
those
circumstances
organized
crime
may
well
take
control
of
charitable
bingo
operations
in
california,
but
as
i
said,
the
stakes
are
kept
low
and
under
california
law--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
i
suppose--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--i
suppose
there
is
another
element--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--and
i
suspect
that
what
you
are
leading
to
is
the
possibility
that
the
state
may
have
some
moral
objections
to
unregulated
gambling.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
pardon
me?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes,
that
is
true.
i
think
the
entire
question
here
is--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
california
allows
a
state
lottery.
it
allows
in
addition...
and
also,
of
course,
low
stakes
bingo,
and
then
finally
horseracing,
horseracing
betting.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
right,
so
i
do
not...
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question,
i
am
not--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--i
have
deliberately
not
tried
to
advance
a
moral
argument
before
this
court.
i
think
that
perhaps
in
its
inception
the
states
did
indeed
regulate
gambling
for
primarily
moral
reasons,
and
that
is
probably
the
way
that
state
regulation
of
gambling
arose,
but
with
the
recent
adoption
of
the
state
lottery
and
other
types
of
state-authorized
gambling
activities,
i
think
that
the
state's
moral
objections
to
gambling
have
diminished.
i
suppose
that
they
are
there.
i
suppose
that
many
people
in
california
support
california's
anti-gambling
laws
primarily
on
moral
grounds,
but
as
i
say,
that
is
not
the
argument
that
we
address
before
this
court
today.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
i
don't
quite
understand
your
question.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
unless
they
are
compliant
with
california
law.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
oh,
for
indians.
okay.
i
think
that--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--i
think
that
the
factors,
the
elements,
and
the
dynamics
of
the
case
would
be
vastly
different
if
indians
were
playing
bingo
on
the
reservation
with
other
indians.
one
of
the
strong
factors
that
supports
state
jurisdiction
here
is
the
fact
that
the
games
are
intended
to
attract
non-indians
to
come
on
the
reservation
to
play
the
games.
where
indians
engage
in
a
purely
internal
activity
on
the
reservation
i
think
a
stronger
argument
can
be
made
by
the
tribes
that
they
have
a
sovereign
right
to
engage
in
that
kind
of
activity.
i
notice
in
the
rice
case--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--that
is
true,
but
still
the
balance
of
interest
we
think
might
indeed
support
that
kind
of
tribal
operation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
that's
true.
california
law,
the
situation
before
the
court
is
not
one
where
indians
are
playing
bingo
amongst
themselves.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
one
of
the
tribes
here
has
only
25
members,
and
i
think
perhaps
only
nine
adult
members.
and
therefore
it
is
hard
to
imagine--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--i
think
that
is
essentially
much
of
our
argument.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
the
fact
that
the
court
did
hold
in
coleville
that
indian
tribes
do
not
have
a
vested
right
to
sell-products
to
non-indians.
i
think
that
is
a
very
important
factor
in
this
case.
i
think
that
the
element
there
was
that
the
tribes
were
engaged
in
activity
with
non-indians,
not
simply
engaged
in
activity
on
the
reservation
involving
only
themselves.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
no,
california
gets
money
from
the
state
lottery
and
the
state
horseracing
act,
but
it
does
not
get
money
from
charitable
bingo.
the
money
from
charitable
bingo,
of
course,
goes
just
for
charitable
purposes.
i
should
add
that
part
of
the
moneys
from
the
state
lottery
do
indeed
innure
to
the
benefit
of
indians
themselves.
to
date
the
state
lottery
has
generated
about
$850
million
for
education
of
california
school
children,
and
given
the
percentage
of
indian
enrollment
in
the
public
schools
in
california
about
$6.5
million
of
state
lottery
funds
heretofore
have
been
expended
just
for
the
education
of
indian
children.
so
the
indian
children
themselves
receive
the
benefits
of
california's
state
lottery,
and
it
is
therefore
difficult
for
us
to
understand
the
tribal
argument
that
somehow
the
existence
of
the
state
lottery
militates
against
the
state
position
here.
another
major
factor
in
this
case,
we
think,
is
the
existence
of
the
organized
crime
control
act.
this
is
an
act
that
was
passed
by
congress
in
1970,
and
it
prohibits
gambling
operations
in
violation
of
both
state
and
local
law.
on
its
face
the
act
might
make
california
gambling
laws
directly
applicable
on
indian
reservations.
but
whether
or
not
that
is
so,
our
view
is
that
the
organized
crime
control
act
at
least
expresses
a
federal
policy,
a
federal
policy
that
supports
the
state
position
here.
it
expresses
a
federal
policy
we
think
in
favor
of
state
regulation
of
gambling
and
against
unregulated
gambling,
and
therefore
as
we
view
it
federal
policy
in
this
case
is
high
congruent
with
the
purposes
of
california
law,
and
also,
as
i
mentioned
earlier,
the
states,
not
indian
tribes,
have
traditionally
regulated
gambling.
gambling
has
not
been
traditionally
regulated
by
the
federal
government.
a
fortiori,
it
has
not
been
traditionally
regulated
by
indian
tribes.
it
is
a
traditional
function
of
the
states
that,
as
justice
stevens
pointed
out,
goes
back
some
time
in
history.
it
is
very
analogous
to
the
type
of
liquor
regulation
that
was
involved
in
the
rice
case,
where
the
court
held
that
indian
tribes
have
not
traditionally
engaged
in
the
regulation
of
liquor
sales.
i
think
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
just
a
few
comments,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
the
plaintiffs
have
stated
that
under
california
law
the
indian
tribes
in
this
case
cannot
conduct
charitable
bingo.
we
differ
very
strongly
with
that
statement.
the
california
penal
code
defines
a
charity
as
an
entity
that
is
exempt
from
state
taxation
under
the
state
revenue
and
taxation
code,
and
section
23701(f)
of
the
state's
revenue
and
taxation
code
provides
an
exemption
for
a
not-for-profit
entity
that
is
engaged
in
promoting
the
social
welfare,
and
our
view
is
that
indian
tribes
can
qualify
as
charitable
organizations
within
the
meaning
of
that
section
and
therefore
can
conduct
charitable
bingo
on
the
same
terms
as
other
charitable
organizations
in
california.
the
plaintiffs
also
stated
that
the
coleville
case
was
not
applicable
in
this
case
because
the
incidence
of
state
regulation
there
fell
on
non-indians.
there
are
two
responses.
first,
the
court
in
coleville
seemed
to
regard
the
incident
of
state
regulation
as
irrelevant,
and
instead
it
held
that
indian
tribes
could
not
gain
a
commercial
advantage
over
non-indian
businesses
by
marketing
products
free
of
the
limitations
that
may
apply
to
those
non-indian
businesses.
the
second
response
is
that
the
incidence
of
state
regulation
here
falls...
does
indeed
fall
on
non-indians.
it
falls
both
on
the
tribes
and
on
the
non-indian
patrons.
california
law
specifically
prohibits
both
the
operation
of
and
the
participation
in
a
lottery,
a
prohibition
that
is
found
in
section
320
of
the
california
penal
code.
therefore
it
is
illegal
for
non-indians
to
participate
in
these
games.
the
plaintiffs
also
argue
that
the
tribes
are
required,
are
required
to
submit
their
management
contracts
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
his
approval.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
at
a
lottery
that
is
not
authorized
by
law.
charitable
bingo
is
authorized
by
law.
therefore
it
is
not
illegal
under
california
law
to
participate
in
an
authorized
charitable
games.
in
other
words,
charitable
games
are
legal
under
california
law.
therefore
the
charity
that
runs
the
game
can
lawfully
operate
the
game,
and
the
people
who
play
the
games
can
lawfully
participate
in
them,
but
lotteries
that
are
not
permissible
under
california
law
impose
the
sanctions
both
against
the
operator
and
the
participant.
the
tribes
also
made
the
statement
that
the
tribes
are
required
to
submit
their
management
contracts
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
his
approval,
and
that
is
simply
not
true.
there
is
no
requirement
in
federal
law
that
requires
these
management
contracts
to
be
submitted
to
the
secretary
for
his
approval,
and
indeed
the
cabazon
tribe
in
this
case
commenced
its
bingo
operation
in
march,
1983,
and
didn't
submit
its
management
contracts
for
approval
until
september,
1986,
after
this
court
granted
review
of
the
case.
so
it
ran
the
operation
for
three
years
without
submitting
he
management
contract
for
approval,
and
apparently
got
around
to
doing
that
primarily
to
improve
its
position
in
this
litigation.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
mainly
local
law
enforcement
agencies,
local
sheriffs
and
police
departments.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
well,
when
there
is
a
potential
violation,
yes,
people
do
indeed
complain,
and--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
i
suppose
the--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--actually,
there
are
very
few
complaints
about
charitable
bingo.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
are
you
talking
now
about
the
tribal
games
or
the
charitable
games?
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
oh,
the
tribal
games
are--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--are
opposed
by
a
wide
number
of
law
enforcement
agencies
in
california.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
they
feel
very
strongly
about
it,
your
honor.
in
fact,
the
last--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
they
are,
and
when
the
new
fellow
gets
elected
he
comes
in
and
complains
it,
too.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
the
charities
themselves
are--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--yes.
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
yes.
that
is
actually
correct.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
i
recall
the
situation
in
arizona--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--well,
i...
no,
there
is
a
vast
opposition
to
charitable...
tribal
bingo
in
california,
and
much
of
the
opposition--
mr.
roderick
eugene
walston
--does
indeed
come
from
charities.
in
fact,
i
am
familiar
with
the
situation
in
arizona
involving
the
st.
keno
learning
school
that
was
dependent
strictly
upon
charitable...
or
i
should...
yes,
charitable
bingo
proceeds,
and
it
was
forced
to
shut
down
simply
because
of
the
competition
from
the
tribal
games
in
arizona.
the
tribes
have
also
made
the
argument
that
the
tribes
need
high
stakes
bingo
in
order
to
effectively
survive
and
obtain
revenue
for
tribal
purposes
and
that
they
have
no
real
options
other
than
tribal
bingo.
well,
president
reagan's
policy
statement
on
which
the
tribes
have
relied
so
heavily
in
this
case
indicates
that
a
number
of
other
types
of
options
are
available
to
the
tribes
to
generate
revenues
for
tribal
purposes,
and
these
purposes
are
listed
at
pages
226
and
227
of
the
joint
appendix,
and
they
are
as
follows:
manufacturing,
agri-business,
and
modern
technology;
second...
i
am
sorry,
my
time
is
up.
