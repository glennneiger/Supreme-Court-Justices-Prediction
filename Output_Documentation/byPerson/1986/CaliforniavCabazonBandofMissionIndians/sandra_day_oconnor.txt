mr.
walston--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--the
interior
department
does
have
certain
guidelines
for
these
bingo
games,
doesn't
it?
it
requires
fbi
checks
and
periodic
audits
and
what
have
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
there
is
certainly
no
question
but
that
the
federal
government
has
supported
and
encouraged
the
tribes
to
engage
in
these
bingo
operations.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
concede
that?

you
don't
concede
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
suppose
nothing
would
prevent
the
department
of
interior
from
adopting
some
kind
of
further
regulation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
feldman,
i
guess
the
most
obvious
concern
about
your
position
in
the
case
is
the
concern
we
would
have
that
the
tribes
are
marketing
an
exemption
from
state
law
and
the
analogy
to
the
cigarette
tax
situation
as
in
coleville.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
the
tribes
could
open
casino
gambling
on
the
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
what
if
we
in
applying
the
balancing
test
thought
that
that
was
the
factor
that
tipped
the
scale,
and
then
if,
as
justice
stevens
suggests,
a
new
secretary
of
the
interior
had
a
different
view,
the
situation
would
change.
