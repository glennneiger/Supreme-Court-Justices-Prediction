mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
think
we
have
seen
a
bit
of
equivocation
on
the
part
of
the
state
here
this
afternoon.
let
there
be
no
mistake
that
what
the
state
is
asking
for
here
is
full
jurisdiction
over
these
tribal
activities
to
shut
them
down
and
put
them
out
of
business.
that
is
what
this
case
has
been
about
since
day
one.
so
we
are
not
here
talking
about
some
minimal
amount
of
intrusion
on
a
tribal
activity.
the
state
is
asking--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
under
california
law
a
great
number
of
organizations
can
sponsor
charitable
bingo,
but
indian
tribes
are
not
among
those
groups,
so
under
california
law
indian
tribes
are
not
able
to
sponsor
even
charitable
bingo
in
california.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
it
is
defined
in
terms
of
the
state
tax
code
if
you
are
subject
or
not
subject
to
certain
aspects
of
california
state
taxes,
but
specific
ones,
and
they
detail
the
organizations.
it
is
little
leagues,
mobile
home
parks,
non-profit
cemetery
associations.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
the
other
point
that
is
important
here
is
this.
the
question
is,
well,
could
they
or
should
they
restrict
the
games
to
tribal
members.
a
crucial
fact
in
this
case
is
that
under
california
law
the
law...
california's
bingo
law
affirmatively
requires
that
the
bingo
games
must
be
open
to
the
general
public,
and
the
games
cannot
be
restricted
solely
to
members
of
the
authorized
organization.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
certainly
the
tribal
interest
is
congruent
with
the
state
interest
here,
but
my
point
is
that
if
the
tribes
were
to
limit
their
games
only
to
tribal
members,
regardless
of
how
large
or
how
small,
they
would
be
in
violation
of
california
state
law.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
your
honor,
we
think
the
situation
here
is
considerably
different
than
that
presented
in
coleville.
i
would
note
at
the
outset
that
in
the
cigarette
tax
case
that
the
incidence
of
the
tax
at
issue
there
was
on
non-indians.
in
this
case
the
incidence
of
the
state's
jurisdictional
scheme
is
directly
on
the
tribes
themselves.
so
the
question
of
whether
the
state
has
jurisdiction
to
regulate
these
activities
is
a
considerably
different
one.
there
it
was
the
non-indians
who
were
being
regulated.
here
the
incidence
of
california's
regulatory
scheme
is
solely
on
the
operators.
non-indians
who
come
onto
the
reservation
to
play
the
games
are
violating
no
state
law.
they
are
evading
no
state
obligation
by
doing
so,
so
california's
interests
are
simply
not
implicated.
in
the
coleville
case
the
cigarette
purchasers
were
evading
a
legal
obligation
to
pay
washington
state
sales...
cigarette
taxes.
here
there
is
no
similar
situation.
in
this
case,
as
a
further
distinction,
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
what
the
indians
were
marketing,
what
the
tribes
were
marketing
there,
the
sellers,
was
really
an
exemption
from
state
tax
laws.
and
they
said
there
was
no
value,
no
tribally
generated
value
that
was
being
presented
or
being
provided.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
the
answer
to
that
is
clearly
no.
under
11...
under
15
usc
section
1175
the
use
or
possession
of
certain
mechanical
gambling
devices
is
a
federal
offense.
that
relates
primarily
to
slot
machines,
roulette
wheels,
wheels,
of
fortune.
so
in
no
instance
could
those
activities
take
place
on
an
indian
reservation.
they
would
be
immediately
in
violation
of
federal
law.
in
addition--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--there
may
be...
there
might
be--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--this
applies
only
on
indian
reservations,
on
federal
reservations.
section
1175
is
a
prohibition
against
mechanical
gambling
devices
on
federal
reservations,
which
includes
indian
reservations.
there
is
a
specific
federal
law
that
deals
with
that.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
getting
back
to
the
question
of
marketing
an
exemption,
the
key
element
there,
i
think,
was
that
the
tribes
were
not
providing
what
was
called
value
generated
on
the
reservation.
here
the
situation
is
quite
different.
there
you
had
people
coming
onto
the
reservation,
buying
cigarettes
which
had
been
imported
from
elsewhere,
and
then
taking
the
cigarettes
off
and
evading
the
state,
the
obligation
to
pay
state
taxes.
what
the
tribes
are
offering
here
are
recreational
services,
plain
and
simple.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
neither
the
cabazon
or
marango
bands
are
required
to.
in
this
instance
they
both
have
submitted
their
bingo
ordinances
and
those
ordinances
have
been
approved
by
the
secretary.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
yes.
in
addition,
in
the
case
of
the
marango
band,
they
have
a
management
agreement,
and
that
management
agreement
has
been
submitted
to
the
secretary,
again
has
gone
through
the
entire
review
process,
background,
fbi
checks,
and
that
agreement
has
been--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--well,
our
position
is
really
pretty
straightforward,
that
if
the
activity
is
prohibited
by
the
state,
then
under
public
law
280
that
prohibition
applies
equally
on
the
reservation.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
no,
the
question
is
what
activity
is
involved,
and
in
this
case
bingo
is
permitted
but
regulated
under
california
law.
that
was
the--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--i
cannot
deny
that
the
test
isn't
going
to
result
in
absolute
clarity
in
every
instance,
but
the
test
that
has
been
developed
and
been
applied
by
every
federal
court
that
has
considered...
every
lower
federal
court
that
has
considered
this
question
has
allowed
them...
first
of
all,
it
is
consistent
with
this
court's
holding
in
bryan.
in
bryan,
this
court...
bryan
versus
itasca
county,
this
court
unanimously
held
that
states
had
no
civil
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
tribal
government.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
there
may
be
a
federal
law
that
would
cover
that.
i
don't
know.
certainly
federal
prohibitions
would
apply
on
reservations.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
if
the
state
permits
local
option
on
prostitution,
then
yes,
our
view
is
that
a
tribal
government
is
equivalent
to
a
city
or
state
or
county
government.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
it
could
go
forward
subject
to
federal
and
tribal
regulation.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
i
think
there
has
got
to
be
an
element
of
common
sense
provided
here.
indian
tribes
are
under
the
direct
control
and
supervision
of
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
and
the
secretary
is
not
going
to
allow
outrageous
activities
on
the
reservation.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
would
we
no
longer
nave
what?
i
am
sorry.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
not
necessarily.
i
think
that
the
secretary's
view
here
and
the
support
of
the
federal
government
is
an
important
aspect
of
this
case.
it
is
not
determinative
necessarily.
it
provides
the
federal
gloss
here,
if
you
will.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
administrations
do
change,
and
federal
policies
towards
indians
change.
today
the
policy
is
in
favor
of
tribal
self-government
and
economic
development.
that
has
not
always
been
the
case.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
yes,
under
25
usc
section
81,
contracts
of
this
type
must
be
approved.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
that's
correct,
ordinances
are
not
mandatorily--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--or
get
rid
of
the
management
company.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
no,
not
necessarily.
the
trend
today
is
to
get
away
from
management
companies.
now
that
tribes
have
had
experience
in
this
activity,
and
i
should
note
that
tribal
bingo
has
been
going
on
in
some
reservations
for
as
long
as
12
years,
and
on
many
reservations
for
six
or
seven
years.
so
tribes
have
now
begun
to
develop
the
managerial
skills
that
they
didn't
have
at
the
outset,
and
today
the
trend
is
away
from
management
contracts
and
towards
internally
operated,
tribally
operated,
wholly
tribally
operated
activities.
i
would
like
to
address--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--i
don't
think
that's
a
matter
of
the
state's
concern.
that
is
a
matter
between
the
tribes
and
the
secretary
to--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--no,
not
that
i'm
aware
of.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
i
certainly
don't
know
what
communication
there
may
have
been,
but
i
am
not
aware
of
any
such
communication.
let
me
make
a
couple
of
points
here
that
i
think
need
to
be
made.
first,
indian
tribes
are
governments,
and
like
all
governments
they
have
to
have
a
source
of
revenue
in
order
to
function.
now,
most
tribes
do
not
have
a
natural
resource
base.
the
cabazon
and
marango
bands
have
reservations
out
in
the
middle
of
the
desert,
and
until
there
is
a
commercial
market
for
sand
or
sagebrush
they
do
not
have
any
sort
of
natural
resources
to
generate
tribal
income.
as
a
result
they
nave
turned
to
bingo
along
with
more
than
120
other
tribes
around
the
country.
in
doing
this
they
have
been
acting
very
much
like
the
28
states,
including
california,
that
have
established
state
lotteries.
the
purpose
is
the
same,
to
provide
governmental
revenues
for
public
purposes.
this
is
in
essence
a
form
of
voluntary
taxation.
now,
the
federal--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--there
is
certainly
nothing
in
the
record
to
support
that,
your
honor.
the
only
information
in
the
record,
which
has
to
do
with
the
size
of
prizes
actually
awarded
here,
is
that
for
a
representative
four-month
period
during
1984
the
average
jackpot
on
the
cabazon
reservation
for
their
bingo
games
was
$184.89,
well
below
the
state
maximum
limit.
now,
that
is
not
to
say
that
in
some
games
they
don't
offer
larger
prizes.
they
do.
we
have
conceded
that.
but
most
games,
and
in
fact
the
state's
under
cover
agent
who
went
in
and
observed
the
activity
and
then
submitted
declaration
makes
it
very
clear
that
while
he
was
there,
yes,
there
were
signs
up
that
said,
$25
to
$300.
so
the
amount
of
money
that
is
actually
being
awarded
here
is
considerably
less
than
what
the
big
letters
say
on
the
sign
outside,
in
the
same
way
that
the
d.c.
lottery
doesn't
award
$20
million
every
week.
it
is
something
that
is
designed
to
improve
the
number
of
people--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--i
think
that
we
haven't
reached
that
issue.
i
think
that
the
advertising
is
legitimate,
and
they
do
in
some
instances
give
away
large
prizes
as
promotional
activities.
but
the
run
of
the
mill
jackpot,
they
are
playing
bingo
out
there
for
$25
in
some
games,
many
games.
so
let's
not
be...
let's
not
be
misled
by
what
the
large
signs
say.
the
reality
is
here,
that
these
games
are
run
and
operated
very
much
like
charitable
bingo.
in
fact,
they
are
consistent
with
every
aspect
of
california's
bingo
law
with
just
three
exceptions.
they
are
operating
the
games
and
they
are
not
an
authorized
organization
under
california's
law.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
there
is
nothing
that
indicates
how
far
people
come
from.
these,
both
cabazon
and
marango
are
within
reasonably
close
distance
to
a
number
of
small
communities,
so
there
is
no
evidence
that
people
are
driving
long
distances
here,
but
more
importantly
we
think
that
what
we
are
providing
are
better
services,
frankly.
we
are
providing...
bingo
players
don't
require
very
much.
bingo
players
want
a
chair
with
a
little
padding
and
smoke-eaters
that
will
clear
the
air
and
get
the
cigarette
smoke
out.
and
if
you
can
provide
that
better
than
the
guy
down
the
street,
then
you
are
going
to
attract
more
people
to
your
bingo.
i
am
being
serious.
that
is
what
these
games
are
offering.
the
tribes
have
built
larger
modern,
clean,
well-lit
facilities,
and
they
provide
a
chance
for--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--no,
this
is
my
argument.
0
[generallaughter.]
but
what
we
are
providing
are
recreational
services
here,
and
there
is
no
indication
why
people
go
to
one
bingo
as
opposed
to
the
other,
but
the
creature
comforts
certainly
have
something
to
do
with
it.
let
me
turn
for
a
moment
to
this
question
of
organized
crime.
what
we
are
dealing
here
on
the
part
of
the
state
of
california
is
at
most
a
hypothetical
concern.
they
have
stipulated
to
the
fact
that
there
is
no
organized
crime
involvement
on
either
the
cabazon
or
marango
reservation.
now,
they
draw
some
distinction
between
whether
they
are
alleging
that
it
is
or
isn't.
i
suspect--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--well,
they
said
thy
hadn't
alleged
it.
my
question
is,
if
i
was
representing
the
state
and
i
knew
of
some,
i
don't
think
i
would
keep
it
a
secret.
i
think
i
would
get
it
out
before
the
court.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
they
say
there
is
a
real
danger
but
the
evidence
points
directly
in
the
opposite
direction.
the
ninth
circuit
concluded
that
there
was
no
evidence
of
organized
crime,
and
more
importantly,
congress
has
studied
this
issue,
but
the
senate
and
the
house.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
i
am
sorry.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
who
is
that?
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
they
said
there
was
no
evidence
of
any
organized
crime.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
they
didn't
address
the
danger
question.
that's
correct.
congress--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--well,
i
suppose
at
some
point
you
have
to
determine
how
realistic,
how
credible
is
the
danger.
here
congress
has
studied
the
issue
extensively
over
the
last
two
years.
they
have
conducted
field
hearings
around
the
country,
including
california,
and
both
the
senate
and
the
house
reports
on
this
legislation
conclude
with
no
qualifications
that
there
is
no
organized
crime
involvement
anywhere.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
h.r.
1920,
the
indian
game
and
regulatory
act,
the--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--that
did
not
pass.
it
passed
the
house
and
was
approved
by
the
senate
select
committee
on
indian
affairs.
it
did
get
caught
in
a
scheduling
crunch
at
the
end
of
the
session.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
it
did
not
pass.
that's
correct.
our
belief
is,
based
on
some
information,
that
the
legislation
is
going
to
be
reintroduced
immediately
upon
congress
coming
back
into
session
and
we
have
some
reason
to
think
that
it
will
perhaps
be
more
successful
this
time.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
no,
it
is
illegal
under--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--15
usc
1175
and
it
is
prohibited
under
pl...
it
would
be
a
criminal
offense
under
pl-280.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
the
difference
between--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--california
permits
but
regulates
the
playing
of
bingo.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
the
question
is,
are
you
focusing
on
the
penal
sanction
or
are
you
focusing
on
the
total
regulatory
scheme?
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
because
california
has
to
demonstrate
that
it
has
some
authority--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--but
that
isn't
what
the
state
is
after.
the
state
is
out
to
prohibit
tribes
from
playing
bingo
under
any
circumstances.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
no,
certainly
not.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
there
has
to
be
some
reasoned
basis
upon
which
california
can
exercise
jurisdiction
over
these
activities.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
if
they
have
a--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--but
the
issue
isn't
bingo
for
more
than
$250.
the
issue
is
what
is
being
regulated
here,
and
it
is
bingo,
bingo
as
opposed
to
slot
machines
or
roulette
wheels.
bingo
is
treated
differently.
the
whole
concept
under
california
law
is
that
bingo
is
going
to
be
widely
permitted
throughout
the
state.
the
state...
that
is
the
difference.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
the
question
becomes
this.
does
the
inclusion
of
a
penal
sanction
in
their
regulatory
scheme
give
them
jurisdiction
over
these
tribal
activities?
that
is
the
question
you
are
asking.
if
the
inclusion
of
that
penal
sanction,
which
establishes
the
outside
limit
of
their
regulatory
scheme,
does
that
give
them
jurisdiction?
our
answer
to
that
under
bryan
is
absolutely
not.
if
that
were
the
law,
bryan
would
be
gutted.
bryan
says
states
were
not
authorized
to
exercise
general
regulatory
jurisdiction
over
indians.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
that
was
the
issue,
but
the
court
used
the
phrase
"civil
regulatory
jurisdiction,
including
taxation.
"
four
times.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
it
is
prohibited--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--right.
exactly.
certainly
all
regulation
involves
some
aspect
of
prohibition.
no
one
disputes
that.
and
this
test
requires
some
judgment
to
be
made
as
to
which
is
the
more
important
aspect
of
the
statute.
at
one
end,
if
they
absolutely
prohibit
it
to
everybody
it
is
clearly
prohibitory.
at
the
other
end,
if
it
is
not
dealt
with
under
state
law,
then
it
is
clearly
not
applicable
on
the
reservation.
there
are
going
to
be
gradations
in
between.
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
the
test
that
has
been
developed
and
the
test
that
has
been
applied
has
been
effective
in
allowing
federal
courts
to
determine
the
extent
of
state
jurisdiction.
that
is
the
question.
has
this
test
been
a
meaningful
way
in
which
courts
can
protect
tribal
self-government
from
unauthorized
assertions
of
state
jurisdiction?
we
think
it
has.
we
think
the
fact
that
every
single
federal
court
that
has
considered
the
question,
and
there
are
now
ten
decisions
over
the
last
five
years,
every
single
federal
court
has
concluded
in
this
manner.
we
think
there
must
be
something
to
those
decisions.
the
test
must
be
workable
or
all
these
federal
courts
wouldn't
have
decided
to
adopt
them.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
i
am
sorry?
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
four
circuit
courts,
six
district
courts.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
two
each
in
the
fifth
and
the
ninth.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
four
different
decisions.
in
any
event
the--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--no,
they
are
scattered
all
over
the
country.
i
think
there
are
six
different
courts.
there
have
been
two
out
of
oklahoma.
other
than
that
they
have
been
all
over
the
country.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
for
bingo
gambling?
no.
no,
that
is
part
of...
bingo
is
civilly
regulated
under
california
law.
and
the
tribe--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--that
would
be
a
matter
for
tribal
regulation.
the
tribes
in
fact
do
have
age
limitations
on
their...
both
of
them
have
them
in
their
bingo
statutes,
18.
if
you
are
under
18
you
can't--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--that's
correct.
in
our
view
this
activity
is
subject
to
federal
and
tribal
jurisdiction
and
not
state
authority.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
first
of
all,
as
part
of
that
management
agreement
it
would
require--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--section
81
isn't
restricted
to
written
agreements,
your
honor.
i
think
that
that
would
also
require
secretarial
review
and
approval
and
an
fbi
background
investigation.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
no,
under
management
agreements.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
oh,
if
it
is
simply
a
terminable
employee,
no,
that
would
not
be...
that
would
not
fall
under
section
81.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
yes,
they
would
come
to
the
tribe
and
they
would
come
to
the
secretary
and
advise
them.
the
state
seems
to
be
operating
under
the
assumption
that--
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
--that
the
tribe
isn't
interested
in
organized
crime.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
well,
if
those
individuals
engage
in
illegal
activities,
the
fbi
does
have
clear
criminal
jurisdiction.
if
they
are
involved
in
stealing
from
the
tribe,
for
example,
embezzling
funds,
it
is
a
federal
offense.
but
more
importantly,
the
tribes
are
governments,
and
they
have
an
interest
in
seeing
that
these
games
are
run
as
effectively
and
as
efficiently
and
as
honestly
as
they
can.
they
have
the
most
to
lose.
so
there
is
no
reason
why
a
tribe
would
knowingly
employ
or
continue
to
employ
somebody
who
is
going
to
provide
trouble
for
them.
now,
the
tribes
have
been
very
effective
in
regulating
these
activities.
their
ordinances
are
very
clear
as
to
what
is
and
what
isn't
permitted.
they
have
employed
security
personnel
to
avoid
any
problems,
and
even
the
smallest
tribe,
even
the
smallest
tribes
have
the
ability
to
regulate
their
games.
they
can
bar
access
to
the
reservation
to
any
non-indian
whom
they
choose.
they
can
seek
judicial
relief
if
there
is
a
problem.
and
finally,
they
can
close
the
games
entirely
until
the
matter
is
resolved,
so
the
tribes...
this
question
arose
in
new
mexico
versus
mescalero
a
couple
of
years
ago
where
the
state
said,
well,
the
tribes
don't
have
an
enforcement
mechanism.
they
can't
do
anything
about
it,
and
the
court
rejected
that
argument
for
much
the
same
reasons
that
i
have
indicated.
now,
we
have
talked...
the
question
was
raised
earlier
about
the
extent
of
federal
support
and
involvement
for
these
activities.
i
think
we
need
to
talk
about
that
just
for
a
moment
because
what
we
have
here
is
a
very
clear
shared
understanding
among
all
three
branches
of
the
federal
government
that
these
activities
are
a
legitimate
means
by
which
tribes
can
raise
revenues.
we
have
got
an
unbroken
line
of
federal
authority
which
support
these
activities
against
state
and
local
jurisdiction.
congress
has
not
completed
action
and
didn't
pass
a
bill
but
clearly
took
many
steps
which
indicate
what
is
likely
to
happen.
it
issued
reports,
for
example,
which
provide
a
pretty
clear
factual
record
as
to
the
benefits
that
bingo
is
providing
to
these
tribes.
they
are
using
their
revenues
for
governmental
services.
they
are
providing
programs
on
the
reservation
that
have
never
been
provided
for.
they
are
doing
this
without
relying
on
federal
funds,
and
that
is
the
whole
idea
of
what
tribal
self-sufficiency
is
supposed
to
be
about.
don't
rely
on
the
federal
government.
go
out
and
raise
the
money
yourselves
and
then
provide
services
to
your
members,
just
like
any
government.
that
is
what
we
have
been
telling
the
indian
tribes
for
100
years,
and
they
have
never
been
able
to
do
it
until
now.
bingo
is
providing
100
or
more
tribes
around
the
country
with
that
ability.
it
is
not
a
nefarious
activity.
it
is
not
threatening.
these
are
games
that
are
being
subject
to
close
scrutiny
by
the
secretary
of
the
interior,
by
his
personnel,
and
the
federal
government
is
strongly
supportive
of
these
activities.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
they
exceed
state
limits.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
the
third
is
that
they
employ...
they
employ
tribal
members
as
employees
in
the
games
as
part
of
the
reason...
in
order
to
provide
employment
opportunities
on
the
reservation.
mr.
glenn
m.
feldman
thank
you
very
much.
