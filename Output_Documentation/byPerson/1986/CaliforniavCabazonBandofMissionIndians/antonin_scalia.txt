california
allows
other
sorts
of
gambling,
doesn't
it?

such
as
what?

horseracing?
justice

it
is
sort
of
hard
to
get
moral
when
you
hit
bingo.

even
though
that
might
attract
criminal
elements
just
as
well.
if
you
have
enough
indians
on
the
reservation
you
can
have
a
pretty
big
bingo
game,
and
organized
crime
might
be
attracted
to
it.
justice

california
is
saying
that
bingo
would
be
like
sand
and
sagebrush
but
for
the
fact
that
california
doesn't
allow
it,
that
it
is
only--
justice
antonin
scalia
i
didn't
understand
them
to
stipulate
that
there
wasn't
any.
they
just
said
they
haven't
alleged
any
to
be
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
california
doesn't
allow
roulette
wheel
gambling.
would
the
reservations
be
able
to
have
roulette
wheel
gambling?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
illegal.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
the
difference
between
roulette
wheels
and
bingo
cards
more
significant
as
to
whether
it
constitutes
a
prohibition
as
opposed
to
merely
a
regulation
than
the
difference
between
bingo
for
under
$250
and
bingo
for
$1
million.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
is
more
important,
that
distinction
is
more
important?
in
other
words,
i
am
asking,
are
you
sure
that
this
is
just
a
regulation
and
not
a
prohibition?
california
prohibits
bingo
for
more
than
$250.
it
is
just
like
prohibiting
roulette
wheels.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
for
over
$250.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
focusing
on
the
activity.
why
isn't
it
realistic
here
in
light
of
the
interest
involved
to
consider
the
activity
to
be
bingo
for
more
than
$250,
and
that
is
absolutely
prohibited
in
california.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
this
wouldn't
hurt
your
clients
a
whole
lot
because
from
what
you
tell
us
they
don't
have
many
games
over
$250
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
wouldn't
have
to
hold
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
we
could
just
hold
that
the
state
could
prohibit
over
$250
and
therefore
they
clearly
win
here,
and
if
the
tribes
want
to
limit
it
to
under
$250
that
will
be
another
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
they
can
if
they
have
a
prohibition
throughout
the
state,
and
as
i
understand
what
has
been
said--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
have
a
prohibition
on
bingo
for
more
than
$250.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
you
know
gamblers
better
than
i
do,
but
i
think
a
real
gambler
would
probably
consider
the
difference
between
a
$250
roulette
game
and
a
$250
bingo
game
as
less
significant
than
the
difference
between
a
$1
million
bingo
game
and
a
$250
bingo
game.
i
think
california
is
prohibiting
high
stakes
bingo
and
the
tribes
are
offering
high
stakes
bingo.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
feldman,
you
started
to
tell
us
earlier
the
only
three
ways
in
which
these
games
don't
comply
with
california
law.
you
got
out
the
first,
which
is
that
tribes
are
not
allowed
to
do
it
under
california
law.
i
assume
the
second
is
the
stake
limit.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
what
is
the
third?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
it
comes
under
the
prohibition
to
participate
in
a
lottery?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
doesn't
that
statute
cover
their
attendance
at
charitable
bingo
within
the
state
of
california?
