we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
86-231,
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation
versus
yahn
and
mcdonnell,
inc.,
et
al,
and
related
case.
mr.
ford,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
not
too
long
ago
sat
en
banc
all
the
time,
didn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
bill
supposed
to
represent,
mr.
ford?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
how
is
that
measured?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
does
that
differ
from
simply
having
to
prove
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
your
own
view
of
the
matter
is
correct?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
a
plaintiff
in
an
ordinary
civil
case
doesn't
get
any
burden
of
proof
assigned
to
him
just
because
he
made
a
particular
choice.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
that
still
gives
me
some
problem.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
a
fairly
manageable
standard,
if
you
say
the
burden
is
on
the
employer
to
establish
by
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
his
view
of
the
facts
are
correct.
but
when
you
say
it
is
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
to
prove
that
the
trustees'
view
is
unreasonable,
that
just
melds,
as
you
say,
questions
of
fact
and
questions
of
law.
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay,
but
then
the...
to
say
that
the
burden
is
on
the
employer
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
determination
was
clearly
erroneous,
i
mean,
that
isn't
the
easiest
thing
when
you
start
parsing
it
down.
is
that
any
different
than
saying
the
burden
is
on
the
employer
to
prove
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
employer's
view
is
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ford.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
taylor.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course...
but
you
can
only
challenge
facially
things
that
apply
to
your
clients.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
the
santosky
case
certainly
didn't
purport
to
restate
settled
principles
as
i
understood
them
that
outside
of
the
area
of
the
first
amendment
there
is
no
such
thing
as
overbreadth.
you
challenge
what
is
applicable
to
your
people
and
you
let
somebody
else
challenge
things
that
aren't
applicable
to
your--
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
are
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
trustees
decide
in
your
client's
case?
what
kind
of
decisions
would
they
make?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
those
disputed
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
either
of
those
disputed
here,
when
and
whether
there
has
been
withdrawal?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
cite
to
1401(a)(3)(a).
what
page
is
that
on?
i
am
having...
65a?
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
it
reads
"for
purposes
of
any
proceeding
under
this
section,
any
determination
by
the
plaintiff?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
okay.
obviously
the
(3)(b)
does
not
cover
this
kind
of
issue.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
doesn't
go
to
arbitration
at
all?
chief
justice
rehnquist
