justice
scalia
how
come
it
is
ripe?
i
mean,
he
is
saying
these
procedures
that
you
are
about
to
subject
me
to
deny
me
due
process,
but
you
don't
know.
justice
scalia
had
he
gone
through
them,
he
might
have
come
up
with
something
that
was
totally
satisfactory.
justice
scalia
oh,
that's
nice.
what
is
the
second
reason?
justice
scalia
it
is
only
prudential?
why
is
it
only
prudential?
justice
scalia
was
that
the
same
situation
as
you
have
here
where
the
only
thing
being
objected
to
is
not
the
taking
of
any
property
but
the
procedure?
the
procedure
is
the
gravamen
of
the
claim?
justice
scalia
xxx
you
say
achieves
that
now?
justice
scalia
after
the
fact?
have
we
done
that?
i
mean,
after
the
insurance
contract
was
entered
into?
i
have
much
less
difficulty
with
these
things
if
the
government
is
just
saying
these
are
the
rules
that
are
going
to
apply
to
these
contracts
that
you
enter
into
in
the
future.
justice
scalia
withdrew--
justice
scalia
--but
had
he
joined
after
it
was
passed?
justice
scalia
well,
that
is
just
like
saying,
you
know,
the
government
can
change
the
attributes
of
insurance
policies
and
say
it
is
fair
enough
so
long
as
you
die
after
the
law
is
passed.
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
the
relevant
moment
is
the
moment
you
bought
the
policy,
not
when
you
died.
justice
scalia
would
you
tell
me
again
how
do
you
want
us
to
read
1401(a)(3)(a)?
what
do
you
want
us
to...
i
mean,
what
does
it
really
say
when
it
says:
shows
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
determination
was
unreasonable
or
clearly
erroneous?
what
does
it
mean?
justice
scalia
you
are
saying
the
word
"clearly"
is
just...
less
than
superfluous,
you
are
just
saying
it
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
justice
scalia
xxx
writing
it
down
facially,
but
it
is
not
a
justification
for
allowing
a
challenge
where
there
has
not
yet
been
any
harm
from
the
process.
justice
scalia
hadn't
the
license
been
denied
or
suspended
then,
and
the
proceeding
was
whether
to
reinstate
it?
are
you
sure
there
had
been
no
harm
suffered?
justice
scalia
no,
but
it
seems
to
me
still
true
that
if
your
broad
reading
of
(3)(a)
is
correct
everything
in
(3)(b)
would
already
have
been
included
within
(3)(a)
because
the
actuarial
assumptions
and
the
rest
are
determinations
made
by
the
plan
sponsor.
justice
scalia
may
i
ask
this,
mr.
taylor?
justice
scalia
would
you
still
be
complaining
if
you
had
entered
this
plan
after
the
statute
was
passed
so
that
you
knew,
every
employer
knew
when
he
went
in
if
i
am
the
first
one
out
this
is
what
is
going
to
happen?
it
seems
to
me,
you
know,
that
is
a
contractual
risk
you
have
taken,
just
as
if
you
went
into
a
private
contract
in
which
there
were
some
provision
that
penalized
in
one
way
or
another
the
first
member
of
the
contract
to
depart.
justice
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean
when
you
say
you
are
not
trying
to
get
the
benefits
of
it.
justice
scalia
well,
but
you
know,
people
always
enter
contracts
for
reasons
of
economic
necessity.
that
is
why
people
enter
contracts.
justice
scalia
it
is
a
statutory
description
of
what
happens
if
you
enter
a
certain
kind
of
contract,
and
if
you
choose
to
enter
that
kind
of
contract,
it
seems
to
me
it
is
no
worse
having
what
you
consider
unjust
procedures
attached
to
your
departure
than
it
would
be
to
have,
let's
say,
a
penalty
attached
to
your
departure,
and
when
you
go
into
the
contract
you
say,
well,
that
is
bad
for
me
if
i
am
the
first
out,
but
it
is
good
for
me
if
i
am
the
last
out,
and
you
know,
i
will
take
it.
justice
scalia
well,
this
pertains
to
your
facial
challenge.
you
are
asking
us
to
strike
the
whole
thing
down.
maybe
it
is
valid
as
to
those
who
entered
into
these
agreements
after
the
statute
was
passed
but
not
invalid
as
to
everybody
else.
justice
scalia
oh.
justice
scalia
all
provisions
you
enter
into
under
coercion
of
strike
threat
are
adhesion
contracts?
justice
scalia
wow.
justice
scalia
no,
but
it
is
a
contract.
i
mean,
whether
there
is
a
benefit
or
not,
the
government
said,
look,
in
the
future,
when
you
enter
into
this
kind
of
a
contract,
this
is
what
happens,
and
you
have
fair
notice,
and
you
chose
to
enter
into
that
kind
of
a
contract.
justice
scalia
clear
and
unmistakable.
