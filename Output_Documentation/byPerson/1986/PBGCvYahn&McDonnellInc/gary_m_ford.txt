mr.
gary
m.
ford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
odds
with
the
decisions
of
five
other
courts
of
appeals,
including
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
first
circuit
sitting
en
banc
for
the
second
time
in
its
history,
a
divided
panel
of
the
third
circuit
has
struck
down
a
rebuttable
presumption
enacted
by
congress--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--i
understand
this
was
the
second
time...
well,
that
is
true,
your
honor.
a
small
court.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
right.
the
question
here
is
whether
in
striking
down
the
rebuttable
presumption
the
congress
enacted
for
use
in
withdrawal
liability
arbitrations
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
third
circuit
in
a
divided
panel
decision
committed
error.
now,
when
congress
enacted
withdrawal
liability
in
1980
it
knew
that
there
are
literally
thousands
of
withdrawals
from
the
thousands
of
multiemployer
pension
plans
in
the
united
states
every
year,
and
that
it
would
be
difficult
if
not
impossible
to
set
up
a
federal
bureaucracy
to
assess
and
collect
these
amounts,
so
it
assigned
to
the
trustees
of
the
pension
plans
the
practical
task
of
formulating
the
initial
claims
for
this
liability.
briefly,
the
trustees
take
the
value
of
unfunded
vested
benefits
in
the
plan,
certified
by
the
enrolled
actuary
of
the
plan,
and
divide
it
up
using
a
statutory
formula
or
a
formula
approved
by
the
pension
benefit
guaranty
corporation.
they
then
send
out
a
bill
after
determining
if
any
of
the
exemption
or
forgiveness
provisions
in
the
statute
apply.
if
the
employer
disputes
the
bill,
the
plan
and
the
employer
are
required
to
try
to
resolve
that
dispute
without
litigation,
but
if
they
can't--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--it
represents
an
initial
claim
of
the
pension
plan
for
liability
for
the
employer's
withdrawal.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
the
statute
starts
out
with
the
amount
of
benefits
that
the
plan
is
legally
bound
to
pay
but
which
are
unfunded
as
of
a
date
before
the
employer's
withdrawal
and
then
the
statute
has
four
detailed
rules
which
the
plan
may
choose
among
for
dividing
up
that
unfunded
vested
benefit
amount
based
generally,
mr.
chief
justice,
on
the
level
of
the
employer's
prior
participation
in
the
plan.
so
the
employer
gets
a
share
that
is
based
generally
upon
what
he
contributed
when
he
was
a
contributing
employer
under
the
pension
plan.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
this
is
a
facial
challenge.
that's
correct,
mr.
justice
blackmun.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
yes,
sir.
now--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--that's
right.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
it
is
possible
that
he
could
have
had
this
case
mooted
had
he
gone
through
the
procedures.
two
responses,
justice
scalia.
first,
the
parties
themselves,
before
we
were
a
part
of
this
action,
agreed
to
proceed
under
the
ruling
of
the
third
circuit
at
that
time
and
circumvent
arbitration
to
bring
the
facial
challenge
to
the
court.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
this
court
in
thomas
against
union
carbide
held
that
where
the
procedures
themselves
are
objected
to
is
fundamentally
unconstitutional,
that
ripeness
is
a
prudential
matter
in
essence,
and
here
the
third
circuit
having
struck
down
a
provision
of
law
enacted
by
congress,
the
appeal
being
mandatory
to
this
court,
and
there
being
considerable
uncertainty
among
the
courts
and
the
arbitrators
who
are
dealing
with
these
disputes,
we
would
suggest
to
the
court
that
it
exercise
its
prudential
judgment
to
decide
this
matter.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
because
there
is
an
objection
to
the
fundamental
fairness
on
the
part
of
the
appellees
and
perhaps
counsel
would
address
that
as
well,
as
to
the
procedures
that
they
are
being
asked
to
go
through.
now...
so
i--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--i
am
hesitant
to
characterize
the
appellees'
position
on
that,
but
i
think
it
would
be
as
follows,
that
the
procedures
themselves
inculcate
or
perpetuate
a
bias
that
predated
the
arbitration
hearing,
so
they
are
being
asked
to
go
through
a
biased
proceeding,
and
the
court
has
held
in
other
contexts...
another
would
be
gibson
against
berryhill...
that
a
party
need
not
do
that.
obviously,
if
the
court--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--that's
correct,
and
again--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--that
is
how
i
understand
the
argument.
yes,
justice
o'connor.
now,
once
the
trustees
have
sent
the
bill
and
they
have
failed
to
resolve
it
amicably
if
there
is
a
dispute,
they
proceed
to
what
we
consider
the
first
adjudication
in
this
case,
and
that
is
arbitration.
it
is
mandatory
under
the
statute,
and
it
is
worth
noting
how
it
works
in
practice.
it
is
a
plenary
proceeding.
there
is
full
prehearing
discovery.
there
is
the
first
occasion
on
which
there
is
the
calling
and
cross
examination
of
witnesses,
the
first
occasion
on
which
a
record
is
made.
it
is
before
a
neutral
arbitrator
chosen
by
the
parties
or
appointed
by
a
federal
district
judge.
and
it
is
the
first
occasion
in
which
a
written
decision
is
entered.
it
is
the
first
adjudication.
congress
chose
arbitration
as
the
forum
for
these
disputes
because
it
is
inexpensive,
quick,
and
therefore
accessible,
unusually
accessible
even
to
small
employers
that
have
a
substantial
disagreement
with
the
claim
of
the
pension
plan.
congress
was
not
seeking
to
foreclose
substantial
challenges
and
it
chose
to
enact
rebuttable
presumptions
for
use
in
the
arbitration
for
three
equally
sound
reasons.
in
both
the
house
and
the
senate
congress
noted
that
its
judgment
was
that
it
would
be
unworkable
and
an
invitation
to
abuse
to
assign
the
burden
of
proof
in
the
arbitration
to
the
pension
plan.
why?
because
the
plan's
calculation
involves
a
large
number
of
steps,
and
the
plan
would
have
to
come
forward
and
establish
the
reasonableness
of
every
actuarial
assumption,
the
accuracy
of
every
underlying
data,
and
inapplicability
of
every
exemption
provision
set
forth
in
the
statute.
congress
was
concerned
that
that
would
be
an
invitation
to
employers
to
lodge
vague
or
nominal
challenges
or
general
challenges
just
to
put
the
plan
through
the
many
days,
perhaps
even
weeks
of
expensive
testimony,
documentary
evidence,
and
the
like
that
would
be
necessary
to
establish
the
reasonableness
of
the
original
claim.
congress
decided
it
would
make
more
sense
to
have
the
claim
serve
essentially
as
a
target
at
which
the
employer
could
take
aim
at
those
issues
which
we
had
a
substantial
disagreement,
and
i
should
note
that
in
the
arbitration
proceeding
there
is
no
limitation
on
the
issues
the
employer
can
raise,
no
limitation
on
the
facts
he
may
adduce.
it
is
a
plenary
proceeding
where
the
employer
comes
forward
with
a
substantial
challenge.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
yes,
it
is.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
justice
o'connor,
let
me
state
at
the
outset
my
agreement
that
the
language
is
at
least
curious.
it
is
ambiguous
in
our
view
and
internally
inconsistent,
and
not
merely
for
the
reason
that
you
refer
to,
but
also
because
the
language,
and
this
is
at
page
65a
of
our
jurisdictional
statement,
melds
a
trial
type
standard,
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
which
is
generally
understood
to
mean
greater
weight
of
the
evidence
or
more
probable
than
not,
with
words
which
appear
in
rule
52,
an
appellate
standard,
clearly
erroneous,
which
is
generally
understood
again
to
this
court's
decisions
in
anderson
against
the
city
of
bessemer
and
so
on,
to
mean
that
the
appellate
court
has
a
firm
and
definite
conviction
that
error
has
been
committed.
now,
we
consider,
first
of
all,
the
melding
of
the
trial
type
standard
with
the
appellate
standard
to
be
an
inconsistency
in
itself,
and
second,
the
preponderance
standard,
to
show
that
something
is
more
likely
than
not,
is
a
somewhat
lower
standard
in
suggesting
that
the
appellate
court
had
a
firm
and
definite
conviction
that
error
has
been
committed.
we
suggest
in
view
of
the
legislative
history,
also
in
view
of
the
related
provisions
of
the
statute
which
this
must
be
interpreted
alongside,
and
in
view
of
the
possibility
of
avoiding
a
somewhat
more
difficult
constitutional
question,
that
the
court
construe
that
language
to
require
the
employer
to
establish
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
the
plan's
determination
was
unreasonable
or
incorrect,
in
other
words,
that
it
not
give
the
clearly
erroneous
language,
the
strict
rule
52
gloss.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
that
is
essentially
what
it
stands
for,
or
that
the
plan
was
unreasonable.
let
me,
if
i
may,
note
how
we
got
there.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
no,
your
honor,
they
are
not.
they
are
a
mixture
of
decisions
that
congress
required
the
trustees
to
perform.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
right.
that's
correct.
in
fact,
we
believe
that
this
presumption
goes
to
factual
determinations
only,
and
that
the
trustees'
determinations
of
law
or
interpretations
of
law,
which
after
all
they
are
not
necessarily
expert
on,
reside
where
they
have
always
resided,
the
authority
for
making
those,
in
the
federal
courts,
and
if
one
looks
at
the
next
provision,
related
provision
in
66(a),
which
is
section
1401(c),
that
is
the
standard
for
the
trial
court's
review
of
what
the
arbitrator
did,
and
it
provides
that
there
shall
be
a
presumption,
rebuttable
only
by
a
clear
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
that
the
findings
of
fact
made
by
the
arbitrator
were
correct.
now,
two
important
things
there.
one,
it
makes
clear
what
we
are
talking
about
are
factual
determinations,
not
legal
determinations,
and
in
fact
the
pbgc's
regulations
enjoin
the
arbitrator
to
apply
all
controlling
precedent,
the
regulations,
opinions,
and
so
on
in
reaching
its
determination
on
issues
of
law.
the
other
thing
that
is
important
there--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--it
suggests...
i
think
that
is
correct.
it
says
the
burden
is
a
clear
preponderance,
which
again
is
a
less
than
clear
choice
of
words
on
congress's
part.
this
is
a
confused
set
of
legislative
drafting.
there
is
no
way
around
it.
what
makes
sense
about
interpreting
the
preceding
provision
to
require
a
more
preponderance
showing
by
the
employer
of
error
is
that
the
district
court
in
1401(c)
is
reviewing
for
whether
something
is
correct
or
not
and
it
would
make
no
sense
to
have
the
district
court
look
for
mere
error
if
the
arbitrator
is
applying
a
clearly
erroneous
standard,
which
is
a
much
narrower
scope
of
review.
your
scope
of
review
on
appeal
would
be
expanding
instead
of
decreasing,
and
that
makes
no
sense
to
us.
now,
there
were
two
other
policy
reasons
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
it
enacted
these
presumptions
besides
the
preventing
abuse.
the
second
was,
as
it
noted
in
the
legislative
history,
on
these
exemption
provisions
which
were
made
much
of
in
the
papers.
it
is
the
employer
that
has
the
evidence.
the
facts
are
in
the
employer's
control.
this
court
has
noted
in
other
decisions
when
you
claim
an
exemption
from
the
statutory
provision
it
is
traditional
that
you
have
the
burden
of
proof
and
it
makes
a
lot
of
practical
sense
if
the
employer
has
the
evidence
that
is
relevant
to
that
exemption.
and
finally,
congress
wanted
at
least
modestly
to
encourage
uniform
treatment
of
similarly
situated
employers.
these
pension
plans
are
amalgamations
of
a
lot
of
different
employers
who
may
many
of
them
be
competitors,
and
the
glue
that
holds
them
together
is
the
sense
that
everyone
in
the
plan
is
being
treated
the
same,
evenhandedly,
and
the
presumption,
while
not
guaranteeing
that
in
every
case,
goes
some
distance
in
discouraging
arbitrators
from
issuing
inconsistent
compromise
awards
that
could
undo
the
basic
cohesion
of
the
multiemployer
pension
plan.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
the
presumption
in
the
arbitration
that
assigns
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
employer
discourages
the
arbitrator
from
essentially
allowing
an
employer
to
slip
a
marginal
case
by
and
discourages
employers
from
feeling
they
can
succumb
to
that
temptation.
if
the
employer
is
right
on
the
law
or
the
facts
or
the
combination
he
ought
to
win,
but
the
arbitrators
ought
not
to
do
what
congress
was
concerned
in
some
other
areas
they
do,
which
is
enter
compromise
awards
just
to
get
along
and
get
to
the
next
case.
they
wanted
them
to
act
more
like
judges.
and
so
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
burden
encourages
them
to
do
so.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
let
me
note
at
the
outset,
justice
stevens,
that
normal
civil
litigants
to
whom
burdens
of
proof
are
assigned,
both
defendants
and
plaintiffs...
for
example,
fraud
is
provable
by
defendants
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence...
are
by
their
nature
biased
in
their
own
interests,
so
even
if
one
accepted
the
argument
of
the
appellees
here
that
trustees
are
biased
doesn't
change
our
conclusion
about
how
fairly
this
statute
works,
but...
and
we
don't
accept
that
argument,
but--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--simply
to
accomplish
the
several
important
practical
policy
goals
that
i
have
enumerated,
preventing
abuse,
making
the
party
with
the
evidence
come
forward,
encouraging
uniformity,
and
second,
looking
at
the
same
factors
that
courts
look
at
when
they
order
the
burden
and
weight
of
evidence,
order
and
weight
of
evidence
in
judicial
proceedings
at
common
law,
who
is
changing
the
status
quo?
in
this
case
the
employer
is
leaving
the
pension
plan.
he
has
had
an
ongoing
relationship
with
the
plan.
it
is
the
employer
who
is
changing
the
status
quo.
where
is
it
more
convenient
to
have
the
burden?
well,
again,
the
facts.
there
are
at
least
partially
in
the
possession
of
the
employer.
courts
often
say
let's
assign
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
parties
seeking
to
prove
the
less
likely
proposition.
congress
could
very
reasonably
have
concluded
that
the
plan
with
its
expertise,
including
an
ongoing
actuarial
consultant,
may
be
the
more
likely
to
prevail
and
assign
the
burden
of
proof
on
that
basis.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
we
don't
believe
that
they
are
biased
or
that
they
are
decisionmakers
in
the
constitutional
sense.
they
bring
a
claim
to
the
arbitration.
they--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--they
do
make
decisions
about
the
application
of
the
law
to
specific
facts,
but
we
would
submit,
your
honor,
that
it
proves
far
too
much
to
say
that
any
time
a
party
in
a
proceeding
makes
those
kinds
of
decisions
he
becomes
an
adjudicator.
every
plaintiff
under
rule
11
in
the
federal
courts
makes
the
same
sort
of
decision
about
the
application
of
the
law
to
the
facts.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
it
may
depend,
your
honor.
in
tax
cases
the
burden
is
on
the
taxpayer.
this
court
has
upheld
statutes
such
as
in
new
york,
dick
against
new
york
life,
where
there
were
state
laws
that
had
the
effect
of
assigning
the
burden
of
proof
to
the
insurance
company
on
whether
a
death
was
accidental
or
suicide.
there
is
nothing
exotic
about
assigning
a
burden
of
proof--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--this
employer
withdrew
after
this
law
was
passed,
over
a
year
later.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
that's
correct.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
he
joined
well
before
that.
that's
correct.
but
he
made
a
decision
to
withdraw
in
november,
i
believe
it
was,
of
1981,
a
year
and
two
months
after
the
statute--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
that
the
court
has
grappled
with
already
the
question
of
an
even
more...
an
overt
form
of
retroactivity
in
its
decision
in
the
r.a.
gray
case,
and
upheld
the
original
version
of
the
statute
which
imposed
liability
for
withdrawal
events
that
occurred
before
september
26th,
1980,
when
the
statute
was
enacted.
congress
has
since
repealed
that
express
retroactive
feature.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
we
would
suggest
that
the
court
read
it
to
assign
to
the
employer
the
burden
of
proof
of
showing
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence
that
a
determination
was
unreasonable
or
erroneous
or
read
the
words
"clearly
erroneous"
to
be
satisfied
where
he
preponderance
of
the
evidence
establishes
it,
and
i
would--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--the
unreasonable
standard,
i
would
note
that
the
language
is
disjunctive,
going
back
to
justice
o'connor's
earlier
question.
the
employer
may
choose...
prove
either
error
or
unreasonableness.
the
unreasonableness
presumably
was
included
by
congress--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--i
think
it
is
not.
what
we
are
suggesting,
in
other
words,
is
that
the
strict
rule
52
gloss
on
the
words
"clearly
erroneous"
not
be
adopted
in
this
context
because
it
simply
in
our
view
doesn't
work.
for
one
thing,
this
is
not
an
appellate
proceeding.
it
is
the
first
trial.
why
have
an
appellate
standard?
i
would
refer
the
court
to
a
case
which
we
found
after
we
filed
our
briefs
but
i
notified
opposing
counsel
of,
and
that
is
the
court's
decision
in
united
states
against
first
city
national
bank,
386
us
361,
where
the
court
was
faced
with
some
other
language
about
the
word
"clearly"
and
noted
that
it
could
fairly
be
construed
to
be
consistent
with
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
burden,
and
there
are
a
couple
of
other
points
in
that
case
that
are
helpful
here
as
well.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
in
reading
this
language
and
rationalizing
it,
one
must
either
deemphasize
preponderance
of
the
evidence
which
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
legislative
history,
with
1401(c)
on
the
next
page,
and
would
present
the
court
with
a
more
difficult
question,
or
it
must
deemphasize
the
word
1401(c).
mr.
gary
m.
ford
no
dispute
here.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
that's
correct.
there's
no
dispute
in
this
case
as
to
whether
there
was
withdrawal.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
there
was
raised,
prior
to
arbitration,
claims
by
the
company
for
treatment
under
certain
exception
provisions.
they
did
not
press
those
claims
in
their
arguments
either
to
the
district
court
or
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
in
our
view
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
as
a
matter
of
prudence
relied
on
those
exception
provisions
in
reaching
its
decision
given
that
they
weren't
briefed
to
it,
and
we
see
no
reason
for
this
court
to
reach
the
exception
issue
either.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
yes,
it
does,
and
the
definition
of
a
withdrawal
is
an
employer's
permanent
cessation
either
of
the
obligation
to
contribute
or
of
covered
operations
under
the
plan.
in
most
cases
that
is
the
same
thing,
obligation
to
contribute--
mr.
gary
m.
ford
--that
is
in
29
usc
1383.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
now,
the
conclusion
that...
the
importance
of
the
whole
entire
discussion
of
the
operation
of
the
presumption
is
that
the
third
circuit
concluded
that
it
insulates
the
decision
of
the
trustees
made
in
formulating
a
claim,
a
civil
claim
from
effective
review
by
the
arbitrator.
we
respectfully
submit
it
does
nothing
of
the
sort,
and
that
that
indispensable...
that
it
merely
allocates
a
burden
of
proof,
and
that
that
indispensable
element
in
the
third
circuit's
decision
was
in
error,
and
that
the
decision
was
therefore
in
error.
we
submit
further
that
the
third
circuit
erred
when
it
concluded
that
the
trustees
prior
to
this
arbitration,
which
proceeds
very
promptly,
are
functioning
as
adjudicators
merely
because
they
formulate
a
claim.
they
don't
decide
a
dispute
between
two
parties.
they
are
one
of
the
parties
and
they
bring
a
claim,
and
that
is
all
they
do.
and
finally,
that
they
erred
when
they
concluded
that
the
same
congress
that
they
believed
appointed
the
trustees
as
adjudicators
required
them
to
be
biased
in
the
exercise
of
that
function.
congress,
the
simplest
refutation
of
that
argument
is
that
congress
itself
said
in
the
legislative
history
it
was
requiring
no
such
thing.
i
would
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
gary
m.
ford
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
let
me
note
at
the
outset
an
important
concession
that
counsel
made,
and
that
is
that
one
of
the
three
fundamental
bases
of
the
third
circuit's
decision,
that
is,
that
the
allocation
method
selection
by
the
trustees
was
an
adjudicative
decision,
was
incorrect,
and
the
appellees
agree
with
the
pbgc
that
it
is
not
an
adjudicative
decision.
also,
the
appellees
have
largely
conceded
the
actuarial
matter.
they
have
noted
that
the
standard,
the
substantive
standard
enacted
by
congress
was
reasonable.
they
have
noted
further
that
in
answer
to
a
question
that
there
may
be
a
case
by
case
determination
of
the
actuarial
interest
rate.
we
respectfully
disagree.
this
case
does
not
present
those
facts.
we
are
aware
of
no
plan
in
which
the
actuarial
work
has
been
anything
other
than
planwide
and
applied
evenhandedly
to
all
withdrawn
employers.
and
the
statute
itself
says
that
they
may
use
the
same
assumptions
for
withdrawn
employers
as
they
use
for
ongoing
employers,
and
the
controller
general's
report
states
that
about
two-thirds
of
them
do
just
that.
now,
as
to
the
application
of
exemption
provisions
in
formulating
the
initial
claim
of
the
plan
we
would
respectfully
suggest
that
this
case
involves
much
more
limited
discretion
on
the
part
of
the
trustees
than,
for
example,
the
administrator
in
marshall
against
jericho,
who
applied
broad
standards
in
formulating,
determining
whether
there
had
been
a
violation
of
the
child
labor
laws
in
formulating
claims
under
the
child
labor
laws.
there
are
detailed
provisions
set
forth
in
what
the
court
has
called
before
this
comprehensive
and
reticulated
statute,
and
the
suggestion
that
in
merely
formulating
a
civil
claim,
not
deciding
one,
but
formulating
one,
that
they
are
transformed
into
judges
or
like
judges,
would
surprise
both
the
trustees
and
most
of
the
parties
to
these
plans
as
well
as
the
agency.
now,
finally,
as
to
bias,
there
is
no
full
funding
requirement
for
these
plans.
there
is
a
mechanical
rule
set
forth
in
section
412
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
if
they
meet
that
mechanical
rule
or
if
they
obtain
a
waiver
from
the
rule
from
the
irs,
they
have
satisfied
the
basic
funding
requirements
for
a
pension
plan.
so
standing
alone,
full
funding
is
not
a
requirement
for
a
fiduciary
under
one
of
these
plans
and
therefore
there
is
not...
that
may
explain
why
in
all
the
life
of
the
statute
there
has
not
been
a
single
suit
brought
challenging
the
decisions
of
the
trustees
and
formulating
these
withdrawal
liability
claims.
the
notion
that
they
are
somehow
exposed
to
suit
as
fiduciaries
for
funding
or
other
reasons
in
formulating
a
withdrawal
liability
claim
is
something
that
occurs
entirely
in
the
realm
of
theory.
now,
they
have
no
pecuniary
or
personal
interest
of
the
sort
this
court
has
found
offensive
in
the
past.
they
receive
salaries
if
they
are
paid
at
all
that
are
not
contingent
upon
their
performance
in
collecting
withdrawal
liability
claims.
withdrawal
liability
is
typically
a
very
small
percentage
of
the
revenues
of
the
plan.
they
have
an
interest
and
bias,
if
you
will,
in
carrying
out
faithfully
the
provisions
of
law
that
congress
has
assigned
them
to
carry
out.
no
different
from
the
school
board
in
the
hortonville
school
district
case,
and
no
different
from
the
optometric
board
in
freeman
against
rogers,
where
this
court
has
upheld
the
choice
of
the
state
legislatures
in
assigning
that
task
to
people
who
believe
in
that
law
and
will
faithfully
carry
it
out.
and
the
suggestion
that
they
bring
to
their
job
as
trustees,
as
fiduciaries,
personal
interests
as
employers
or
as
unions
is
unsubstantiated
on
this
record,
and
reads
into
oblivion
this
court's
decision
in
the
amax
coal
case,
which
in
fact
trustees
generally
truly
endeavor
to
follow.
