well
they
are
claiming
a
biased
decisionmaker,
in
effect.
justice
o'connor
and
they
argue
that
in
every
case
the
decisionmaker,
as
structured
here,
is
inherently
biased.
justice
o'connor
under
1401(a)(3)(a),
which
is
the
section
dealing
with
things
like
determination
when
the
withdrawal
takes
place
and
whether
it
falls
within
an
exception
and
so
forth.
the
language
is
a
little
curious.
it
says
that
the
determination
by
the
trustees
is
presumed
correct
unless
the
party
contesting
it
shows
by
a
preponderance
that
the
determination
was
unreasonable
or
clearly
erroneous.
justice
o'connor
which
one,
and
why
is
it
phrased
that
way,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
the
things
that
are
covered
under
1401(a)(3)(a)
are
not
simply
policy
determinations,
are
they,
like
the
decisions
under
(a)(3)(b)?
justice
o'connor
they
might
be
matters
of
historical
fact.
justice
o'connor
is
that
any
different
from
saying
the
burden
shall
be
upon
the
party
who
brings
the
action
in
the
district
court
to
prove
his
case?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
one
did,
why
should
there
be
a
presumption
of
correctness
for
their
factual
determinations?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
just
looks
like
there
are
different
categories
of
things,
though,
under
the
statute,
and
as
to
things
like
the
actuarial
assumptions
and
which
method
of
allocation
is
going
to
be
used,
that
perhaps
that
isn't
even
an
adjudicative
decision.
but
when
you
get
to
the
things
covered
by
the
first
subsection,
and
purely
factual
questions,
i
just
wonder
how
much
sense
it
makes
to
give
a
biased
decisionmaker
a
presumption
of
correctness
for
that
kind
of
thing.
justice
o'connor
no,
but
aren't
they
for
some
historical
facts
on
questions
of
when
the
withdrawal
took
place
and
whether
the
exceptions
are
called
into
play,
and
so
forth?
justice
o'connor
or
whether
an
exception
applies?
justice
o'connor
--but
as
to
what?
as
to
things
under
(a)(3)(b)
only?
what
are
you
really
concerned
about?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
doesn't
look
like
there's
anything
that
your
client
has
raised
under
(a)(3)(a),
is
there?
justice
o'connor
is
there
a
dispute
about
the
date
of
withdrawal?
justice
o'connor
and
you
don't
really
quarrel
with
the
approach
then
in
(3)(b)
for
actuarial
assumptions?
we
don't
quarrel
with
the
words
"reasonable
in
the
aggregate".
and
the
burden
can
be
placed
on
withdrawing
employer
as
far
as
you
are
concerned
in
arbitration
then
to
prove--
justice
o'connor
--but
that
is
so
different
from
an
historical
fact.
how...
what
standards
could
the
arbitrators
or
a
court
possibly
employ--
justice
o'connor
--to
determine
whether
the
actuarial
assumptions
are
valid
other
than--
justice
o'connor
mr.
taylor,
even
if
you
are
right
on
the
bias
question,
explain
to
me
again
if
you
would
why
it
is
unconstitutional
for
congress
under
1401(a)(3)(b)
to
place
the
burden
of
proof
on
the
withdrawing
employer
on
the
unreasonableness
of
actuarial
assumptions--
justice
o'connor
--before
the
arbitrators.
justice
o'connor
yes,
but
i
don't
understand
why
congress
couldn't
place
the
burden
of
proof
of
unreasonableness
on
the
withdrawing
employer.
now,
i
can
understand
your
argument
under
(a)(3)(a)
if
there
is
some
fact
issue
being
decided
by
a
biased
decisionmaker,
but
i
frankly
don't
understand
it
under
b
as
to
the
actuarial
assumptions.
