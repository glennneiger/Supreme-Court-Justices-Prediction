mr.
carl
l.
taylor
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
first
to
address
the
question
why
is
this
case
ripe,
because
it
seems
to
me
that
should
be
addressed
at
the
outset.
there
are
three
answers
in
sequence.
the
first
is
that
this
challenge
is
facial
and
systemic.
the
second
is
that
because
it
involves
a
standard
of
proof,
santosky
v.
kramer,
decided
by
this
court
in
1982,
applies,
where
this
court
said,
"respective
case
by
case
review
cannot
preserve
fundamental
fairness
when
a
class
of
proceedings
is
governed
by
a
constitutionally
defective
evidentiary
standard.
"
that
is
at
page
1397
of
102
supreme
court.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
what
i
read
that
as
saying,
your
honor,
is
that
the...
how
the
statute
works
in
one
particular
case
cannot
inform
us
when
we
are
looking
at
a
constitutionally
defective
evidentiary
standard.
the
rare
case,
the
exceptional
case,
as
the
santosky
decision
goes
on
to
point
out
in
a
footnote,
cannot
decide
the
constitutionality
of
an
evidentiary
standard.
we
must
look
at
the
statute,
and
we
must
look
at
the
statute
in
a
facial
way,
much
as
this
court
has
looked
at
this
statute
before
in
determining
the
substantive
due
process
constitutionality
of
this
statute
in
a
facial
context
both
in
gray
and
in
connelly.
we
must
look
at
it
here
in
a
facial
way
to
determine
the
constitutionality
of
this
presumption
from
a
procedural
due
process
point
of
view,
and
i
might
add
that
where
the
claim
is
lack
of
an
an
impartial
decisionmaker,
where
that
is
the
procedural
due
process
violation,
that
is
precisely
what
this
court
has
done
in
cases
like
gibson
versus
berryhill,
where
the
court
upheld
a
federal
district
court
enjoining
the
proceedings
of
the
state
board
of
optometry
before
those
proceedings
had
concluded,
before
any
decision
was
rendered
on
the
ground
that
the
members
of
that
board
were
inherently
biased
because
they
were
competitors
and
had
a
pecuniary
interest
and
therefore
the
proceedings
shouldn't
even
start.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
i
don't
recall
that
that
was
the
case,
your
honor.
i
think
the
proceeding
was
to
determine
whether
the
optometrists
who
were
on
trial,
as
it
were,
should
be
disbarred,
if
you
want
to
use
that
phrase,
for
being
employees
of
a
corporation
practicing
optometry.
i
think
that
was
the
context
in
which
that
arose.
and
they
sued
in
district
court
to
enjoin
the
proceedings.
now,
in
a
facial
challenge
you
must
look
at
the
language
of
the
entire
statute,
we
suggest,
which
gets
to
the
next
preliminary
question
of
can
we
look
at
exceptions;
can
we
look
at
decisions,
at
determinations
made
by
trustees
that
may
not
specifically
apply
to
this
employer?
and
the
answer
is,
if
this
is
a
facial
challenge,
of
course
we
can,
just
as
in
gray
and--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--your
honor,
i
suggest
that
again
under
the
standard
in
the
santosky
case
that
that...
that
restricts
this
court
too
much.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
perhaps
the
court
misunderstood
me
or
i
misunderstood
the
court.
we
are
only
challenging
the
presumption
of
correctness
in
arbitration.
that
is
all
we
are
challenging.
but
to
see
how
that
presumption
works--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--under
both
(a)(3)(a)
and
(a)(3)(b),
your
honor.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
our
client
did
in
fact
raise--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--our
client
did
in
fact
raise
a
contest
under
1405
of
the
statute,
29
us
code
1405,
as
to
whether
as
a
liquidating
employer
it
was
entitled
to
a
reduction.
it
also
raised
the
point
that
its
net
liquidation
value
would
be
essentially
zero
so
that
it
was
entitled
also
to
a
reduction
under
29
us
code
section
1405(b).
the
pbgc
points
out
that
those
were
not
pressed
in
district
court.
the
pbgc's
brief,
its
reply
brief
concedes
that
particular
exceptions
don't
need
to
be
pressed
even
in
review,
even
in
requesting
plan
review
in
order
to
be
raised
in
arbitration.
the
pbgc
says
expressly,
clearly,
succinctly
in
its
reply
brief
that
you
can...
that
an
employer
can
raise
in
arbitration
things
that
it
has
not
previously
raised,
so
that
to
return
to
where
i
was,
i
do
suggest
to
this
court
that
in
determining
how
this
presumption
works,
the
court
needs
to
look
at
the
provisions
of
the
statute
to
which
it
applies,
and
the
kinds
of
decisions,
the
kinds
of
determinations
that
the
trustees
must
make,
and
it
needs
to
look
at
those
also
to
see
why
the
trustees
have
a
conflict
of
interest
and
how
that
conflict
of
interest
translates
through
into
the
presumption.
now,
this
case
essentially
involves
the
constitutionality
of
ex
parte
adjudicative
determinations
made
by
the
trustees
with
a
conflicting
legal,
financial,
and
personal
interest,
without
a
de
novo
review
of
any
sort.
now
the
thing
that
blocks
that
de
novo
review
is
this
presumption.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
the
trustees
would
decide,
first
of
all,
the
facts
producing
the
liability.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes,
they
are.
among
the
disputes
in
terms
of
what
this
employer
specifically
raised
below
are
whether
it
is
a
liquidating
employer
and
what
its
not
liquidation
value
is
and
whether,
as
the
plan
replied,
it
is
not
entitled
to
those
because
there
are
other
employers
in
the
control
group
who
are...
who
have
assets.
now,
to
go
beyond
that
and
look
at
the
kinds
of
things
that
the
plan
has
the
authority
to
determine
in
determining
whether
liability
should
be
assessed,
there
are
questions
of
whether
the
employer
has
withdrawn,
when
it
has
withdrawn.
as
was
pointed
out
earlier
in
this
argument,
those
are
historic
facts.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
not
that
i
am
aware
of,
your
honor.
the
date
is
not
a
critical
date...
is
not
a
critical
question
here,
and
the
whether
as
i
understand
it
is
not
an
issue
either.
it
is
the
how
and
whether
some
of
these,
these
ameliorating
provisions
apply.
now,
if
i
might
take
one
of
the
ameliorating
provisions
as
an
example,
the
plan
says
or
the
pbgc
says
that
these
are
really
just
exceptions,
and
therefore
the
employer
should
have
the
burden
on
them
because
people
that
are
trying
to
take
advantage
of
an
exception
usually
have
the
burden
on
that
anyway.
one
of
the
provisions
of
the
statute,
29
us
code
section
1398,
says
that
notwithstanding
any
other
provision
of
this
part,
an
employer
shall
not
be
considered
to
have
withdrawn
because
he
is
in
a
labor
dispute.
now,
that
language,
it
seems
to
me,
clearly
enjoins
the
plan
from
assessing
if
there
is
a
labor
dispute,
and
therefore
that
the
plan
has
to
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
there
is
no
labor
dispute.
now,
another
provision,
29
us
code
section
1398.1,
enjoins
the
plan
from
making
an
assessment
because
of
a
change
in
corporate
form
such
as
where
a
parent
company
sells
the
stock
of
a
subsidiary
and
the
subsidiary
continues
for
a
while
and
then
fails.
the
plan
says
that
is
all
very
fine
but
we
allege
alter
ego.
we
allege
that
you
really
continued
to
control
that
company
after
you
sold
the
stock
of
it.
that's
the
sort
of
an
allegation--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--yes,
sir.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes,
your
honor,
in
1401.
in
the
presumption
itself
in
1401(a)(3)(a),
it
says
that
any
determination
made
by
the
plan
sponsor
under
sections
1381
through
1399
must
be
determined
in
arbitration,
and
that
this
presumption
applies
to
those.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
it
is
the...
i
was
citing
the
statute,
your
honor,
the
us
code
section.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
in
the
jurisdictional
statement.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
that's
it,
your
honor.
that's
it.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
(3)(b)
is
a
particular
subset.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
well,
i
think
that
decisions
under
(3)(a),
because
they
deal
with
historical
facts,
are
either
correct
or
not
correct.
you
know,
they
are
either
true
or
not
true.
the
withdrawal
is
either
one
date
or
another
date.
there
is
not
a
range
of
reasonable
dates.
when
you
come
to
things
like
actuarial
assumptions
there
can
be
a
range
of
reasonable
dates
as
it
were,
so
that--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--i
think
the
difference
is
the
word
"reasonable
in
the
aggregate".
we
don't
quarrel
with
those
words.
the
effect
of
vacating
the
presumption
here
would
simply
be--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--in
(3)(b).
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
it's
a
difference--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--it's
a
difference,
not--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--no,
your
honor,
i
would
distinguish
between
the
words
"reasonable
in
the
aggregate"
and
who
has
the
burden
of
proving
that.
and
i
would
suggest
that
for
the
same
reasons
that
the
(3)(a)
must
fall,
the
(3)(b)
must
fall
as
well,
which
leaves--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--the
only
difference,
your
honor--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--the
only
difference,
your
honor,
would
be
that
the
plan
must
prove
that
the
assumptions
are
reasonable
in
the
aggregate
rather
than
the
employer
having
to
prove
that
they
are
unreasonable
in
the
aggregate
because
29
us
code
section
1393
independently
says
that
the
assumptions
must
be
reasonable
in
the
aggregate.
we
are
not
contending
that
there
is
a
right
or
wrong
answer
when
it
comes
to
actuarial
assumptions,
and
that
suggestion
on
the
part
of
the
plan,
on
the
part
of
the
pbgc
is
erroneous.
now,
when
we
get
to
the
second
kind
of
question
that
the
plan
has
to
determine
ex
parte
it
is
the
amount
of
the
liability,
and
among
the
key
ingredients
there
are
things
like
what
is
the
interest
rate
going
to
be
for
return
on
investments
in
the
future.
now,
these
are
arbitrable
assumptions.
these
are
arbitrable
matters
and
not
legislative
matters
and
not
policy
matters
because
congress
has
made
them
arbitrable
under
the
statute.
that
is
the
short
and
simple
answer.
it
is
clear
under
1401
that
these
matters
go
to
arbitration.
that
is
why
we
have
a
presumption
on
it.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
if
the
court
would
turn
to
page
9a
of
the
appellee's
brief,
we
have
set
forth
in
the
appendix
the
actual
assessment
made
by
this
plan
to
this
employer.
page
9a
under
subparagraph
7a,
the
court
will
see
that
current
assets
are
valued
at
market
value.
if
the
court
will
then
look
at
subparagraph
(c)(1)
the
court
will
see
that
the
interest
assumption
for
the
future
is
6
percent.
now,
to
the
extent,
for
example,
that
the
present
assets
are
held
in
let's
say
30-year
government
bonds
at
14
percent,
bought
back
in
1982
with
good
foresight,
those
bonds
are
already...
their
current
market
value
takes
into
account
that
14
percent,
and
we
suggest
it
is
nonsense
to
assume
that
the
future
income
stream
on
those
is
going
to
be
6
percent,
but
that
is
precisely
what
this
plan
is
doing
when
it
says
that
the
blanket
assumption
on
the
return
on
all
investments
is
6
percent,
which
is
the
lowest
you
could
possibly
get
and
still
stay
within
the
range
of
reason.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
if
the
circumstances
call
for
a
difference,
your
honor,
then
the
law
requires
a
difference.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
now,
there
is
an
issue
in
the
brief
as
to...
by
the
way,
before
i
leave
that,
we
do
concede,
we
agree
with
the
pgbc
that
the
allocation
method,
the
presumptive
or
one
of
the
other
three
or
four
methods
for
determining
how
the
unfunded
vested
liability
is
going
to
be
allocated
is
not
an
arbitrable
matter.
congress
has
not
provided
for
that
to
go
to
arbitration.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
that
doesn't
go
to
arbitration
at
all.
that
simply
determines
what
formula
they
are
going
to
use
to
divide
up
whatever
liability
they
come
up
with,
and
that
does
not
go
to
arbitration.
now,
i
would
like
to
turn
to
why
the
trustees
have
a
conflict
of
interest.
first
of
all,
they
have
an
adverse
legal
duty.
the
plan,
the
plan
involved
in
this
case
concedes
that
the
trustees
are
biased.
it
says
at
page
30
of
its
main
brief
that
"the
bias
of
the
trustees
is
permissible
because
the
trustees
are
obligated
by
congress
to
be
biased
in
favor
of
pension
plans.
"
now,
that
may
be...
that
may
be
all
to
the
good,
but
the
plan
concedes
that
they
are
biased,
but
the
plan
goes
on
to
say
at
the
same
page,
page
30
of
their
main
brief,
"by
its
very
nature
an
assessment
of
withdrawal
liability
is
intended
to
benefit
the
interests
of
the
plan
over
those
of
a
withdrawing
employer.
"
what
that
amounts
to
is
nothing
more
than
this
court
has
said
in
amax
coal,
which
is
that
the
trustees
owe
an
exclusive
duty
to
the
beneficiaries,
which
excludes
any
consideration
of
anyone
else,
including
employers.
now,
the
trustees
also
have
a
duty
to
ensure
full
funding,
and
while
it
is
quite
true,
as
the
pbgc
points
out,
that
they
may
not
get
sued
in
any
individual
withdrawal
liability
case
for
having
failed
to
collect
the
maximum,
if
they
don't
perform
their
duty
over
a
period
of
time
to
ensure
full
funding
they
have
got
a
risk,
and
they
have
got
a
risk
of
personal
fiduciary
liability.
that
is
what
they
are
there
for,
is
to
protect
the
beneficiaries
by
ensuring
full
funding.
and
in
that
sense
this
case
is
just
like
ward
versus
monroeville,
were
the
mayor
had
executive
responsibility
for
the
finances
of
a
town.
these
trustees
have
executive
responsibility
for
the
finances
of
the
plan.
now,
second,
the
employer
trustees
have
an
adverse
financial
interest,
and
the
pbgc
concedes
that.
the
pbgc
at
page...
at...
i
am
sorry,
it
is
not
in
its
brief,
it
is
in
a
federal
regulation
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
at
page
14,
it
is
50
federal
register
34680,
pbgc
says,
"interests
of
employers
that
will
withdraw
in
the
future
are
materially
different
from
those
of
employers
who
will
not
withdraw.
"
now,
it
is
not
hard
to
see
why.
the
more
that
the
staying
employers
can
assess
from
the
leaving
employers,
the
less
the
staying
employers
are
going
to
have
to
pay
of
that
liability.
there
is
100
percent
of
the
liability.
if
they
can
collect
a
greater
percentage
of
it
from
the
leavers
then
they
will
have
less
to
pay
in
the
future.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
precisely
because--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--precisely
because,
your
honor,
the
determination
of
those
assumptions
is
made
ex
parte
by
individuals
who
lack
impartiality.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
your
honor,
i
will
agree
with
the
court's
suggestion
that
the
harm
under
b
is
less
than
the
harm
under
a.
that
certainly
is
a
permissible
view
of
it.
but
the
harm
is
still
there.
and
the
harm
is
that...
the
harm
is
less
because
of
this
range
of
reasonableness
which
certainly
is
reasonable
for
congress
to
have
imposed.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
your
honor,
i
think
that
analysis
applies.
the
answer
is,
yes,
i
would
still
be
complaining,
and
i
think
the
reason
is
that
that
analysis
applies
only
if
you
can
say
that
we
are
trying
to
get
the
benefits
of
this
statute
and
therefore
must
take
its
burdens
as
well,
as
in,
for
example,
arnette
v.
kennedy,
involving
civil
service
dismissal.
we
would
be
happy
not
to
have
the
statute
at
all.
we
are
not
trying
to
claim
the
benefits
of
it,
and
we
would
not
be
trying
to
claim
the
benefits
of
it
even
if
we
had
joined
it
after
the
effective
date,
which
we
did
not.
we
were
predecessor...
we
were...
this
employer
was
part
of
this
plan
before
this
statute
was
enacted,
and
renewed
its
contract,
by
the
way,
in
december
of
1980,
but
that
makes
no
difference
because
it
couldn't
have
withdrawn
without
getting
the
liability.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
we
are
not
trying
to
get...
no
employer
is
trying
to
get
the
benefits
of
this
statute.
if
an
employer
joins
one
of
these
plans
he
joins
it
because
the
union
insists
and
he
faces
a
strike
if
he
doesn't.
in
other
words,
it
is
something
that
comes
out
of--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--yes,
but
what
i
am
suggesting,
your
honor,
is
that
this
is
not
a
contractual
liability.
it
is
a
statutory
liability.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
i
think
what
the
court
is
suggesting
is
either
a
consent
or
a
waiver
argument,
and
i
would
invite--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--this
court's
opinions,
overmeyer
v.
freckam
and
others,
say
that
a
waiver
of
procedural
due
process
rights
must
be
clear
and
unmistakable.
it
must
appear
on
the
face
of
the
contract.
it
must
not
be
a
contract
of
adhesion.
the
court
said
that
in
fuentes
v.
chevon.
if
this
is
consent
at
all,
if
this
is
waiver
at
all,
it
is
a
waiver
of
adhesion.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
it
is
not
a
knowingly--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--exactly.
exactly.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
exactly.
this
is
not
a
clear...
there
is
no
clear
and
unmistakable
waiver
that
you
can
apply
to
all
employers
who
first
enter
a
plan
after
the
statute
was
passed,
i
suggest,
unless
they
say
that
more
explicitly
than
simply
signing
a
union
contract
that
calls
for
contributions
to
a
pension
plan.
again,
this
is
not
like
arnette
v.
kennedy,
which
describes
a
very
narrow
exception,
that
you
waive
your
procedural
due
process
rights
to
have
your
liability
fairly
determined
and
impartially
determined
when
you
take
the
benefit
of
a
government
job.
this
is
not
like
that
at
all.
there
is
no
benefit
to
the
employer
in
this
statute.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
i
would
respectfully
suggest
the
clear
and
unmistakable
waiver
analogy
ought
to
apply
here.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
yes,
and
also
the
contract
of
adhesion
is
important
in
fuentes
and
in
overmeyer
v.
shick.
just
briefly,
the
union
has
an
adverse...
the
union
trustees
have
an
adverse
personal
interest
because
they
have
very
often
been
embroiled
in
the
underlying
controversy
that
has
led
to
the
withdrawal,
such
as
a
strike
or
a
decertification
of
the
union
by
the
employees.
and
therefore
they
are
like
the
judge
in
aetna
v.
lavoie
decided
here
last
year.
now,
under
those
circumstances
there
is
no
need
for
a
special
showing
of
bias.
as
aetna
said,
you
don't
need
to
decide
whether
in
fact
someone
is
biased;
whether
in
fact
there
is
a
conflict
of
interest,
but
only
whether
there
is
a
possible
temptation
by
the
average
person.
withrow
v.
larkin
said
that
bias
or
conflict
of
interest
is
systemic
where
experience
teaches
that
probability
is
too
high.
now,
let
me
suggest
that
labels
do
not
save
this
presumption.
the
critical
defect
in
this
presumption
is
ex
parte
determination
by
a
person
who
is
not
impartial
without
any
de
novo
review.
an
ex
parte
bias
is
not
a
substitute
for
evidence,
no
matter
what
sort
of
a
presumption
label
you
put
on
it.
if
you
say
that
it
simply
establishes
a
prima
facie
case,
it
is
still
a
biased
or
conflict
of
evidence
prima
facie
case.
if
you
simply
say
it
shifts
the
burden
of
persuasion,
it
shifts
it
because
of
bias
or
conflict
of
interest,
and
that
is
not
permissible
either.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
your
honor,
that
is
a
different
case.
the
irs
is
collecting
tax
for
the
government
as
a
whole,
not
for
the
irs,
so
it
is
not
like
jericho,
marshall
v.
jericho.
the
agents,
the
irs
agents
by
irs
regulation
are
not
evaluated
on
results.
that
is
prohibited.
and
finally,
finally--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--well,
your
honor,
the
irs
is
one
agency.
the
distinction
that
this
court
made
in
marshall
v.
jericho
was
that
even
though
the
money
was
going
to
the
agency,
it
was
not
going
in
any
particular
proportion
to
results.
here
the
money
isn't
even
going
to
the
agency.
in
marshall
v.
jericho
the
court
found
that
distinction
to
be
important.
i
am
suggesting
here
that
jericho
certainly
solves
the
tax
case.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
i
think
it
would.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
i
certainly
think
it
would.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
unless
congress
adjudicatively
determines
some
particular
presumption,
such
as
in
usery
v.
turner
elkhorn--
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
--where
fact
a
can
be
presumed
from
fact
b.
here
congress
has
determined
nothing
in
particular.
congress
has
not
exercised
a
legislative
policy
judgment
at
all
that
any
particular
fact
flows
from
any
particular
other
fact.
it
is
whatever
the
trustees
of
this
plan
decide
to
determine,
that
is
presumed
correct.
that
is
all
that
congress
has
said
here.
congress
has
not
looked
at
any
particular
fact
situation.
now,
to
get
back
to
the
tax
question,
the
final
distinction
there
is
that
the
irs
regs
provide
for
an
impartial
internal
appeal
to
the
office
of
appeals
which
is
managed
completely
separate
from
the
field
agents.
they
are
an
entirely
different
chain
of
command,
and
by
regulation
says
it
must
be
impartial.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
if
they
didn't
have
that?
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
in
order
to
finish
going
through
a
couple
more
points
i
would
like
to
say
that
since
they
have
it
and
since
that
reg
itself
points
out,
i
think
maybe
the
best
answer
is
the
reg
itself.
i
am
looking
at
26
cfr,
section
601.106,
rule
1,
which
says,
"an
exaction
by
the
united
states
government
which
is
not
based
on
law,
statutory
or
otherwise,
is
a
taking
of
property
without
due
process
of
law
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
united
states
constitution.
"
"accordingly
you
must
be
scrupulously
careful
to
be
impartial.
"
i
think
the
irs
regs
suggest
that
it
would
otherwise
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
carl
l.
taylor
thank
you.
