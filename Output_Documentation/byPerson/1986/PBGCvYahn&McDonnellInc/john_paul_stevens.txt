justice
stevens
they
got
all
four
judges
in
one
room?
justice
stevens
mr.
ford,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
are
pointing
out
that
their
competitors,
that
the
trustees
may
be
employed
by
competitors
of
the
withdrawing
employer
makes
the
bias
argument
greater
rather
than
lesser.
justice
stevens
mr.
ford,
can
i
ask
you
a
question?
you
may
have
answered
it,
but
i
am
a
little
lost
in
the
case.
one
of
the
questions
i
suppose
that
can
come
up
is
whether
there
was
actually
a
withdrawal,
and
in
this
case
is
there
any
dispute
as
to
whether
there
was
a
withdrawal?
justice
stevens
so
that
really
is
a
question
that
may
not
have
to
be
faced
up
to?
justice
stevens
does
the
statute
contain
a
definition
of
when
a
withdrawal
occurs?
justice
stevens
what
section
is
that
definition
in?
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
taylor--
justice
stevens
--is
it
clear
the
presumption
applies
to
those
issues?
justice
stevens
i
know
courts
have
held
that,
but
i
don't
think
the
statutory
language
is
all
that
clear.
justice
stevens
it
is
65a.
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
why
you
needed
(3)(b)
if
you
read
(3)(a)
correctly.
justice
stevens
where
are
the
words
"reasonable
in
the
aggregate"?
justice
stevens
i
must
say
i
dismiss
them.
justice
stevens
oh,
i
see,
reasonable...
all
right.
justice
stevens
--yes,
but
in
these
matters
isn't
it
a
fact
that
if
the
actuary
makes
an
interest
assumption
for
purposes
of
computing
unfunded
liability
and
the
rest
they
are
going
to
make
the
same
assumptions
for
purposes
of
filing
their
reports
and
for
purposes
of
making
claims
like
this
and
all
the
rest.
there
isn't
much
chance
to
juggle
that
kind
of
an
assumption.
justice
stevens
well,
do
you
think
that
in
a
withdrawal
proceeding
they
could
come
up
with
one
interest
assumption
and
then
use
entirely
different
assumptions
in
running
the
plan
and
computing
their
annual
unfunded
liability
and
the
like?
justice
stevens
i
am
glad
i
am
not
a
trustee
of
one
of
those
plans.

justice
stevens
is
it
unconstitutional
for
the
revenue
code
to
give
the
government
a
presumption
that
assessments
are
valid?
justice
stevens
no,
but
their
client
has
the
same
interest
as
the
trustee's
client
has
here.
the
client
wants
the
money.
he
wants
a
presumption
to
shift
the
burden
to
the
other
side.
justice
stevens
yes,
out
supposing
you
had
a
statue
that
said
in
big
stores
like?
woodward
and
lothrop
when
they
send
out
their
bill
we
will
presume
it
is
correct
but
the
customer
has
to
pay
it
unless
he
can
prove
it
is
wrong.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
you
do?
justice
stevens
you
think
the
burden
must
fall...
the
constitution
requires
in
all
civil
litigation
the
burden
must
be
on
the
plaintiff?
justice
stevens
or
in
here
they
say--
justice
stevens
--but
if
it
didn't
have
that
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
justice
stevens
yes.
is
that
your
position?
