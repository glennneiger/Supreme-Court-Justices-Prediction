mr.
robert
k.
best
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue
of
the
scope
of
protection
under
the
just
compensation
clause,
where
the
right
of
the
nollan
family
to
exclude
others
from
the
property
surrounding
their
family
home
on
the
coast
of
california.
the
case
comes
to
you
on
an
appeal
from
a
decision
by
the
california
court
of
appeal
which
overturned
favorable
judgments
for
the
nollans.
the
trial
court
had
ruled,
after
a
review
of
the
facts
of
the
case,
that
the
nollans
intended
action
to
replace
one
single
family
residential
structure
with
a
new,
larger
family
home
would
have
no
effect
on
the
public's
access
to
and
around
the
beach
in
the
area
of
their
home;
and
therefore,
could
not
justify
the
imposition
on
the
nollans
of
the
requirement
placed
by
the
california
coastal
commission
that
they
dedicate
an
accessway
covering
approximately
one-third
of
their
property,
for
public
use.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
issue
was
never
raised
below,
justice
o'connor,
so
it
was
not
decided
by
the
courts
below
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
k.
best
yes.
the
house
was
constructed
without
the
permit.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
construction
was
going
on
during
the
time
this
case
was
on
appeal.
and
our
point
here,
on
that
particular
argument,
is
that
the
presentation
by
the
attorney
general
and
our
response
to
that
in
our...
our
response
to
the
second
motion
to
dismiss
is,
that
that
is
not
california
law;
that
what
california
law
provides--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--no,
i
don't
believe
it's
necessary
to
decide
that
question
here,
because
i
think
california
law
on
the
point
is
very
clear.
mr.
robert
k.
best
i
don't
believe
so.
i
guess
to
the
extent,
if
this
court
believes
there
is
a
question
as
to
whether
or
not
a
waiver
of
a
right
to
follow
a
judicial
proceeding
has
occurred.
our
point
is
that
the
courts
below
have
already
decided
that
point,
and
the
courts
have
said
that
mandamus
is
always
available.
there
was
a
recent
california
supreme
court
decision
in
the
candid
enterprises
case,
which
is
cited
in
our
response,
where
the
court
essentially
dealt
with
the
same
issue
and
expressly
said
that,
although
a
waiver
may
occur
as
to
past
expenditures,
as
to
damages
that
had
occurred,
preceding...
in
reliance...
not
challenging
the
permit,
that
the
remedy
of
mandamus
is
always
available.
and
that
has
been
california's
proceeding
all
along
the
line.
otherwise,
without
the
remedy,
you
put
the
permit
applicant
in
essentially
this
problem
of
having
to
swallow
an
unconstitutional
provision.
and
one
of
the
things
that
were
very...
concerning
us,
in
terms
of
the
argument
that
is
being
made
by
the
attorney
general
here,
is
to
suggest
that
the
permit
processes
may
be
used
as
an
exaction
mechanism
without
regard
to
the
facts
of
the
case,
because
it
shifts
the
whole
burden
onto
the
property
owner.
whenever
the
government
wants
a
piece
of
property,
if
they're
lucky
enough
to
have
jurisdiction
over
the
owner
for
any
reason
where
a
regulatory
permit
is
involved--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--absolutely,
your
honor.
he
must...
if
this
case...
if
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeal
is
not
reversed,
the
nollans
are
obligated
to
make
the
dedication
of
the
property
for
the
public
right
of
way.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that's
correct--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--no,
it
is
not
an
access
from
the
road
to
the
beach.
it
is
an
access
along
the
beach.
the
commission--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--and
the
seawall.
mr.
robert
k.
best
there's
some
dispute
as
to
how
far
it
is.
but
according
to
the
property
records
that
exist
at
this
time,
we're
talking
about
approximately
35
feet.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
nollans
have
title
to
that.
mr.
robert
k.
best
no.
the
dedication
provision
is
for
pass
and
repass
rights,
which
means
the
public
can
walk
back
and
forth
and
use
the
beach
for
tide
pooling,
for
getting...
if
they're
surfing,
to
take
their
surfboards
along,
and
so
forth.
but
it
would
not
allow
them,
for
example,
to
engage
in
recreational
activity.
mr.
robert
k.
best
in
theory,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
if
the
public
has
access,
your
ability
to
go
out
and
say,
well,
sure
you
can
walk
up
and
down,
but
you
can't
stand
and
talk,
the
nollans
feel
that
once
the
door
is
opened,
the
ability
to
interject
any
sort
of
effective
control
is
going
to
be
lost.
mr.
robert
k.
best
surf,
justice
scalia?
mr.
robert
k.
best
yes,
sir,
they
do
surf
there
now.
they
can
surf
there
without
the
accessway,
and
this
is
a
popular
surfing
area.
mr.
robert
k.
best
well,
surfers...
as
a
surfer,
they
go
in
at
the...
at
the
open
public
access
areas
that
exist
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
north,
and
a
few
hundred
yards
to
the
south
of
the
nollans'
property.
and
then,
of
course,
they
can
paddle
their
surfboards
around
any
place,
and
surf
where
they
can
surf.
and
if
they
surf
in,
they
turn
around
and
go
back
out
again.
so
it
doesn't
really
have
a
significant
impact
currently.
this
is
a
very
active
surfing
beach
even
without
the
access
provision
that's
there,
is
the
point
i'm
trying
to
make.
mr.
robert
k.
best
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
k.
best
we
think
there's
a
very
important
distinction
with
this
case,
is
that
it
is
not
a
regulation
of
use,
as
the
prohibition
on
building
anything
would
be
a
regulation
on
use.
mr.
robert
k.
best
it's
different
in
a
practical
effect
because
what
is
happening
is,
you
are
actually
transferring
a
property
to
the
government,
and
other
people
are
obtaining
an
interest
in
your
property.
mr.
robert
k.
best
it's
a
difference
in
practical
effect
specifically
in
they
have
no...
they
lose
their
ability
to
go
out
and
ask
people
not
to
be
there.
in
other
words--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--that's
true,
but
if
the
fences
aren't
there--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
correct.
which
of
course--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--no,
i
think
it's
the
opposite
of
a
fence.
in
other
words,
if
they
were
denied
the
ability
to
put
up
a
fence,
then
they
would
not
have
a
physical
barrier,
but
they
could
still
go
out
and
say,
don't
cross,
you
know...
don't
cross
the
beach.
mr.
robert
k.
best
well,
you
couldn't
put
up
a
fence
without
a
coastal
development
permit.
and
there's
clear
that
they're
not
going
to
approve
that.
and
again,
you
see,
that
would
be
a
regulation
of
use.
mr.
robert
k.
best
justice
scalia,
we
have
both
kinds
in
california.
some
people
do
not
trespass
without
a
fence;
other
people
do.
and
that's
part
of
the
problem.
this
is
an
open
access
for
anybody.
mr.
robert
k.
best
if
you
have
a
coastal
development
permit,
you
can
put
up
a
sign.
mr.
robert
k.
best
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
it
would
be
approved.
mr.
robert
k.
best
but
again,
you
see,
that's
a
regulation
on
use.
mr.
robert
k.
best
not
without
a
coastal
development
permit.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that's
correct.
and,
again,
you...
again,
the
nollans
are
not
disputing
that.
and
justice
stevens,
i
want
to
go
back
to
that
and
emphasize,
the
nollans
feel
there
is
a
big
difference
between
being
told...
their
being
told
not
to
do
something
on
their
property,
and
being
told
to
allow
somebody
else
to
do
something
on
their
property.
and
whether
that
is
being
told
not
to
put
up
a
fence,
or
not
to
put
up
a
sign,
that...
or
being
told
not
to
build
on
the
beach
area,
they
concede
that
the
state
has
that
authority.
mr.
robert
k.
best
well,
let's
look
at
in
a
practical
sense.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
could
be
hired...
that
could
be
done
without
a
permit.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that's
correct.
a
man
can
come
in
on
the
surf,
and
he
can...
because
the
tidelands
are
public.
in
other
words,
the
lands
up
to
the
mean
high
tide
are
public,
and
surfers
are
free
to
ride
in
and
turn
around
and
go
back
out
again
without
regard
to
this
particular
accessway.
but
i...
let
me
explain
to
you
why
this
is
important
to
the
nollans.
i
think
it's
important
to
recognize
this.
faria
beach
is
a
variable
beach.
the
sand
washes
in
and
the
sand
washes
out.
and
there
are
admittedly
times
when
it
is
not
particular
important
to
the
nollans
to
be
able
to
exclude
the
public;
times
when,
as
some
of
the
briefs
have
said,
you
have
a
rocky,
relatively
inhospitable
area
separated
by
a
high
seawall.
but
when
the
sand
comes
in,
and
there
are
pictures
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
261
and
265,
that
shows
you
have
a
broad
sandy
beach
with
a
relatively
low
seawall.
and
when
you
have
that
kind
of
a
circumstance,
then
it
isn't
so
much
of
a
concern
of
the
people
who
are
walking
across
the...
the
foot
33,
34
and
35,
right
along
the
surf.
the
nollans
have
no
interest
in
excluding
people
from
normal
use
of
the
beach.
but
this
dedication
is
not
just
a
few
feet
along
the
side
of
the
tidelands.
it
goes
all
the
way
up
to
the
seawall.
and
at
times
like
that,
people
can
walk
along
just
a
few
feet
from
the
nollans'
house.
they
can
see
over
the
seawall
directly
into
their
living
area.
they
can
reach
over
the
seawall
into
the
very
small
area
that
is
left
between
their
house.
now,
as
any
parents
of
small
children,
that
concerns
them.
mr.
robert
k.
best
i
cannot
believe
they
made
that
argument,
your
honor.
again,
in
our
reply
brief,
we
point
out
that
the
constitutional
provision
has
been...
has
been
interpreted
several
times
by
the
california
supreme
court
and
by
several
courts
of
of
appeal,
and
it
has
never
been
interpreted...
in
fact,
the
attorney
general's
own
opinion
on
this
matter
says
that
these...
that
provision
has
never
been
interpreted
to
allow
the
public
a
right
of
access
across
private
lands.
i
simply...
and
the
case
they
cited
in
their
brief
do
not
stand
for
that
proposition.
in
fact,
those
very
cases
reinforce
that
private
land
is
private
land.
the
nollans'
fee
title
is
no
less
than
anybody
else's
fee
title.
mr.
robert
k.
best
and
you
would
think
there
would
be
no
need
for
even
asking
for
the
exaction
in
the
first
place,
because
the
right
would
already
exist.
the
commission
had
never
believed
that
they
had
this
right
without
this.
the
commission
made
reference
to
maybe
there
are
prescriptive
rights,
or
maybe
there
was
an
implied
dedication,
although
none
of
those
matters
were
ever
decided
either
by
the
commission
or
the
courts
below,
but
never
referred
to
the
fact
that
we
have
an
absolute
right
under
the
california
constitution
for
access.
i
simply
don't
know
where
that
argument
came
from.
now,
on
this
case,
we
would
like
to
emphasize
that
since
it
is
not
a
regulation
abuse,
since
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
not
a
prohibition
on
the
nollans,
and
this
property
is
stringently
regulated.
i
mean,
recognize
this.
you
have
a
very
small
piece
of
property
that
is
only
allowed
for
single
family
residential
use,
and
it
is
very
stringently
regulated
in
terms
of
health
and
safety
standards
as
to
what
you
can
build
there.
and
the
nollans
are
complying
with
all
of
that,
and
not
challenging
any
of
that.
this
is
not
really
a
land
use
issue,
in
the
sense
that
nobody's
asked
to
change
the
approved
land
use,
a
land
use
which
has
been
in
effect
for
over
half
a
century.
what
the
question
here
is,
in
essence,
the
coastal
development
permit
is
another
building
permit,
a
second
level
building
permit,
in
addition
to
the
one
the
nollans
had
to
acquire
from
the
county
and
local
governments.
so
the
controlling
factor
in
a
takings
analysis
when
applied
to
this
type
of
case
is
the
character
of
the
governmental
action
being
involved
here;
the
fact
that,
indeed,
what
we
have
here
is
the
government
engaged
in
an
acquisition
program.
there
is
an
established
state
program
to
develop
a
roadway
along
the
beach.
it's
set
forth
preliminary
in
the
statute,
and
then
the
commission,
in
its
policy
guidelines,
adopted
for
the
whole
state,
expressly
says
they're
going
to
take
this
kind
of
an
accessway
from
any
kind
of
development,
without
regard
to
what
it
is,
as
long
as
it's
not
expressly
exempted
in
the
statute.
the
guidelines
go
so
far
as
to
say,
look
at
the
need
for
access,
and
look
at
the
property's
ability
to
give
that
access,
and
don't...
don't
look
at
what
the
property
owner
is
doing
when
you
decide
to
take
that
access.
in
the
staff
report,
in
making
the
decision,
the
commission
refers
to
the
comprehensive
program
right
at
faria
beach
itself
to
obtain
this
kind
of
an
accessway.
mr.
robert
k.
best
yes,
sir.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that
is
within
the
power
of
the
commission.
that's
a
regulation
of
use.
mr.
robert
k.
best
and
that
case
is
not
this
case,
your
honor.
the
commission
has
the
power
to
deny
that.
and
if
they
denied
the
rebuilding
of
it,
then
we
would
be
here
on
a
traditional
regulatory
takings
case,
if
this
court
had
ever
been
interested
in
taking
another
traditional
takings
case.
but
that
would
be
a
denial
of
use.
and
this
case
does
not
dispute
either
the
authority
of
the
state
to
obtain
an
accessway
along
the
coast
if
they
want
one,
or
the
ability
of
the
commission
to
restrict
use.
what
this
case
disputes
is
the
ability
of
the
state
to
obtain
the
accessway
without
condemning
it
by
attaching
the
requirement
that
the
accessway
be
given
to
them
on
a
regulatory
permit
to
which
they're
otherwise
eligible.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
accessway
that
they
have
now
is
what
is
called
vertical
access,
in
other
words,
north
of
the
nollans
and
south
of
the
nollans
a
few
hundred
yards
in
each
direction,
there,
one,
is
a
public
beach
area
where
they
get
all
the
way
to
the
coast.
mr.
robert
k.
best
if
we
lose
here--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--then
the
nollans
will
have
to
dedicate
across
approximately--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--that
will
give
a
square
of
beach
in
the
middle
of
private
beach--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--which
some
people
are
using
right
now.
mr.
robert
k.
best
some
members
of
the
public
are
using
it
right
now,
with
the
permission
of
the
nollans.
but
the
nollans
currently
have
the
ability,
if
there's
something
going
on
there
they
don't
like,
or
if
they
don't
want
the
people
crossing
within
a
few
feet
of
their
window,
to
go
out
and
ask
them
to
cross
down
by
the
waterway
and
stay
away
from
their
private
residence,
for
example,
if
their
small
children
are
playing
in
the
backyard.
they
lose
that
under
this
access
provision.
mr.
robert
k.
best
they
lose
basically
the
ability
to
control
who
comes
on
their
property.
mr.
robert
k.
best
i
didn't
hear
that
last--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--no,
your
honor,
it's
much
more
than
the
feelings
are
hurt.
as
parents
of
small
children,
you're
talking
about
the
backyard
of
their
home.
this
is,
in
effect,
one
big
sandbox
in
the
backyard
of
their
home,
and
they
would
like
to
retain
some
ability
to
control--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--that's
correct.
but
the
swimming
pool
isn't
there.
the
swimming
pool
belongs
to
the
public.
and
so
does
the
sand
right
adjacent
to
the
swimming
pool
belong
to
the
public.
then
there's
a
sand
that
belongs
to
the
nollans.
and
again,
one
of
the
most
difficult
aspects
about
this
particular
effect,
and
why
the
nollans
are
upset
about
it,
is,
the
commission
didn't
just
say,
let's
take
a
little
strip
of
sand
along
towards
the
water.
the
commission
said,
we
want
all
this
beach,
all
the
way
up
to
the
seawall,
which
means,
people
could
wander
back
and
forth
right
next
to
their
windows.
mr.
robert
k.
best
the
seawall,
justice
stevens,
varies
in
height
depending
on
the
season
and
how
much
sand
is
there.
and
the
pictures
in
the
record
will
demonstrate
that.
mr.
robert
k.
best
your
honor,
it
can
be
as
high
as
eight
feet
high.
at
other
times,
it
is
as
low
as...
as
three
or
four
feet.
mr.
robert
k.
best
no,
it's
the
other
way
around.
when
the
sand
comes
in,
the
water
retreats,
and
you
have
a
very,
very
broad...
it's
when
the
sand
washes
out
that
the
water
comes
all
the
way
into
the
seawall.
mr.
nollan's
declaration
said
from
his
measurements,
at
the
time
when
the
sand
has
accreted
on
the
beach,
that
the
mean
high
tideland
stops
ten
feet
beyond
his
property;
ten
feet
beyond
his
property
line;
there's
ten
feet
of
sandy
beach
area
above
the
mean
high
tide
line
before
his
property
line
begins.
mr.
robert
k.
best
oh,
they
can
use
that
ten
feet.
mr.
robert
k.
best
it's
only
where
mr.
nollan's
property
line
ends.
mr.
robert
k.
best
well,
the
beach
is
useable
for
one
reason--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--if
there's
no
sand,
what
you
have
is
a
lot
of
rocks
with
some
sand
in
between
the
rocks.
and
then
the
beach
is
useable
for
tide
pooling
or
for,
you
know,
there's
a
lot
of
things
people
do
at
the
beach
besides
play
volleyball.
and
when
the
sand
comes
in,
you
have
more
recreational
opportunities.
but
the
beach
is
definitely
useable
except
in
those
situations
where
the
storm
tides
are
in
and
the
water
is
really
pounding
against
the
seawalls
and
in
unusually
high
tides.
mr.
robert
k.
best
not
as
long
as
the
seawalls
hold.
they
will
be
damaged
by
extremely
high
weather,
by
the
water
coming
over
the
seawalls
and
hitting
the
house.
but
they're
been
there...
been
there
many,
many
years,
and
the
damage
has
not
been
irreparable,
or
sufficient
to
get
people
not
to
rebuild.
mr.
robert
k.
best
i
think
that,
again,
when
you're
having
a
prohibition,
a
regulation
on
use,
that
the
only
way
we
can
evaluate
that
is
with
what
effect
that
has
on
the
value
of
the
property
and
so
forth.
there
they're
not
acquiring
property
for
themselves.
they're
saying,
don't
do
something
to
disturb
the
property.
the
question
is,
maybe
that
would
make
that
property
totally
worthless.
mr.
robert
k.
best
and
might
be
a
taking.
mr.
robert
k.
best
if
it
doesn't
make
it
worthless,
and
there's
still...
the
property
is
still
of
value
to
the
owner,
then
it
would
not
appear
to
be
a
taking,
unless
you
came
under
one
of
the
other
factors
in
the
penn
central
analysis.
mr.
robert
k.
best
well,
it's
exceedingly
different
from
our
case.
let
me
emphasize
that
again.
we
have
one
lot,
replacing
the
same
use
on
the
same
lot.
in
a
subdivision
case,
you're
normally
talking
about
multiple
lots.
frequently
a
change
in
use
from
undeveloped
property
to
developed
property.
and
you
have
a
different
factual
context.
and
i
think
what
we
are
supporting--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--under
out
view--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--yes,
your
honor.
under
our--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--roads?
yes,
your
honor.
under
our
view
of
the
takings
clause,
it's
an
ad
hoc
factual
inquiry
based
on
that
case.
and
the
case
presents
different
factors.
now
this
case
is
not...
this
court
has
not
decided
specific
case
of
this
type
before.
and
that's
why
we
have
analogized
to
the
assessment
cases
in
our
opening
brief,
and
suggested
that
one
of
the
ways
you
can
distinguish
between
the
minimal
type
cases
where...
where
the...
have
a
minimal
effect,
and
it
would
be
a
taking
to
impose
an
exaction,
and
the
other
types
of
cases
is,
by
analyzing
whether
the
property
owner
is
creating
a
burden
or
not,
and
the
exaction
is
solely
for
the
purpose
of
relieving
that
burden.
here
we
have
two
problems.
one
is,
it's
clear
on
the
record,
nobody
really
denies
that
what
the
commission
is
doing
is
taking
the
property.
they
want
the
property
for
a
totally
different
purpose;
nothing
to
do
with
what
they're
building
there.
mr.
robert
k.
best
that's
correct,
your
honor.
if
they--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--it's
not
the
same
objective,
and
it's
not
the
same
result,
and
i
think
that's
where
you
and
i
are
having
trouble
communicating.
what
we
are
saying
is,
they're
free
to
regulate
this
sandy
beach
area,
allow
nothing
to
be
done
on
it,
for
the
purpose
of
keeping
an
open
coastal
area
for
asesthetic
and
environmental
reasons.
mr.
robert
k.
best
nothing
that
will
physically
prevent.
they
can't
put
anything
on
it.
mr.
robert
k.
best
now,
there
we
would
draw
the
line.
when
you
get
beyond
the
signs,
when
you're
talking
about
the
physical
development
and
then
saying,
and
you
cannot
stop
people...
in
other
words,
and
in
effect,
you
must
give
them
a
right
of
way.
mr.
robert
k.
best
you
can't
sue
somebody.
you
can't
enforce--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--you
can't
force...
you
can't
throw
them
off.
you
can't
call
the
cops
and
say
they're
trespassing.
as
long
as
the
government
is
saying,
don't
build
a
fence.
don't
put
a
barrier
out
there
of
any
kind,
that's
fine.
but
when
they
get
to
the
point
and
say,
and,
you
lose
your
legal
right
to
tell
somebody
to
leave
your
property,
no
matter
how
obnoxious
or
how
distasteful
you
find
their
presence,
or
threatening
to
your
family
you
may
find
their
presence,
that's
where
the
line
has
to
be
drawn.
in
effect,
here,
there's
just
no
dispute.
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
a
right
of
way,
a
right
of
way
for
the
public
to
walk
back
and
forth
across
this
property;
and
we
are
dealing
with
a
program
that
takes
a
very
important
concern...
this
is
a
private
residence,
a
family
with
small
children...
away
from
this
family
to
serve
a
program,
a
statewide
program.
and
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes
for
rebuttal
if
there
are
no
other
questions.
mr.
robert
k.
best
i'll
be
brief,
your
honor.
i'd
like
to
address
quickly
two
concessions
made
by
counsel
in
her
presentation,
conceding
that
there
must
be
the
reasonable
relationship
test
applied
in
this
case,
and
also
earlier,
a
concession
that
if
the
case
is
limited
to
an
evaluation
of
the
facts
of
the
nollans,
she
would
concede
that
they
were
in
trouble.
so
in
essence
what
their
argument
is
is
that
there
must
be
a
reasonable
relationship
test,
but
the
reasonable
relationship
is
between
their
legislative
findings,
or
their
statewide
program,
and
what
they
are
doing,
and
not
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
and
that's
our
fundamental
concern
here,
is
that
this
taking
analysis
should
be
performed
on
the
facts
of
the
case.
mr.
robert
k.
best
i
think
you
could
try
to
do
it
on
a
general
basis.
you're
doing
a
facial
challenge
based
on
a
taking
and--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--that
would
be
our
position,
your
honor,
that
they
would
have
to
have
that
exemption
because
of
the
takings
clause.
we
can
justify
it
in
a
police
powers
sense,
and
having
a
rational
basis
for
what
they're
doing.
but
if
the
effect
of
that
is
to
take
the
property,
each
individual
property
owner
is
entitled
to
show
on
the
facts
of
his
or
her
case
that
that
would
be
the
result.
when
you
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
they're
relying
on
this
visual
access
concept.
you
know,
quite
frankly,
that's
strictly
a
made-up
proposition.
in
other
words,
they
decided
to
take
this
access
before
it
was
remanded
to
them.
and
when
it
was
remanded
to
them,
they
had
to
come
up
with
a
reason.
but
if
you
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case,
if
you
look
at
the
picture
on
page
267
of
the
joint
appendix,
you
have
a
picture
taken
from
the
road
across
a
one-story
house
almost...
very
similar
to
what
used
to
exist
on
the
nollans'
property,
toward
the
ocean,
and
what
do
you
see?
you
see
no
beach.
you
see
no
surf.
you
see
no
ocean.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
here,
from
the
roadway,
if
you
look
at
the
beach,
anything
that
is
more
than
about
six
feet
high,
if
that's
how
tall
you
are,
blocks
your
view.
there
was
no
visual
access
with
the
old
development
on
the
property.
mr.
nollan
submitted
pictures
in
the
record,
and
a
declaration
in
which
he
described
the
pictures,
and
says,
look
it,
i've
stood
at
all
these
points
and
looked
at
the
ocean
and
you
can't
see
anything.
it's
just
simply
the
commission's
legislative
finding
that
anytime
you
build
a
bigger
house
you're
going
to
block
visual
access
which
they're
relying
on.
they
won't
look
at
the
facts
of
the
case.
they
won't
look
at
what
is
happening
to
the
nollans.
and
i
think
that's
a
particular
concern
when
we're
dealing
with
a
question
of
is
there
sufficient
information
in
the
record
to
make
a
decision
in
this
case.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
relatively
simple,
and
they're
all
clearly
in
the
record.
you
had
a
house
that
was
there.
it
was
being
used
for
single
family
usage.
it
blocked
all
view
of
the
ocean.
the
only
thing
the
nollans
did
was
to
build
a
bigger
house.
they
had
to
go
above
the
10
percent,
because
as
the
trial
court
said
in
its
original
findings,
10
percent
on
the
old
house
wasn't
enough
to
add
a
decent
closet
to
the
house;
and
it
would
still
be
a
house
that
was
not
acceptable
for
a
family
dwelling.
and
so
the
nollans
were
caught.
they
were
caught
in
a
situation
where
they
were
a
member
of
a
trust
before
this
permit
process
ever--
mr.
robert
k.
best
--justice
white,
the
house
is
bigger
in
all
ways.
it's
wider,
it's
deeper,
and
it's
taller.
the
reason
it
doesn't
block
view,
though,
is
because
in
the
older
house
there
were
fences
that
went
out
from
the
house
to
the
property
lines
which
blocked
the
view.
and
you
couldn't
see
the
beach,
the
sand,
the
surf
or
the
ocean
over
the
fences,
either.
and
so,
again,
the
point
is,
on
the
facts
of
this
case,
we
have
a
taking.
thank
you.
