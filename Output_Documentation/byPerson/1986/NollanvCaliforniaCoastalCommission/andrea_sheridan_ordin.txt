ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
contrary
to
the
argument,
we
do
believe
that
this
is
another
traditional
regulatory
taking
case
before
this
court.
before
you
is
a
fairly
unremarkable
condition
which
is
allowed...
which
has
been
placed
by
the
coastal
commission
on
the
granting
of
a
permit
for
new
development,
granting
really
a
sidewalk
by
the
sea,
allowing
persons
to
pass
and
repass
in
that
perhaps
10-foot
area
between
the
high
mean
tide
and
the
tow
of
the
seawall.
the
record
is
not
entirely
clear
how
tall
that
seawall
is.
eight
feet
appears
in
the
solicitor
general's
record.
different
figures
appear
in
declarations.
the
pictures
at
the
back
of
your
appendix,
i
think,
make
it
very
clear
that
in
great
part,
all
seawalls
tend
to
be
above
the
heads
of
all
who
walk
along
there.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
that's
exactly
right,
and
how
much
water
there
happens
to
be,
as
you
recognize
from
those
pictures
also.
it
is
an
inhospitable,
rocky
shore,
much
of
the
time,
with
the
water
lapping
or
crashing
against
that
seawall.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
yes,
it
is.
faria
trust
beach.
and
was
once
a...
a
larger
trust
which
has
now
been
broken
into
these
smaller
parcels
and
lots,
each
with
single
family
dwellings
or
vacation
homes.
but
here
it
was
a
permit
by
the
coastal
commission
which
was
granted
to
build
new
development.
the
coastal
commission
didn't
say,
no,
you
may
not
build
a
house
that
is
three
times
as
large
as
the
one
that
was
there
before.
the
coastal
commission
did
not
say,
you
may
not
have
a
two-story
house
here
which
will
block
visual
access,
which
will
cause
the
types
of
burdens
that
we
sere
in
the
record
below.
the
coastal
commission
after
taking
evidence,
and
of
course
with
some
help
from
the
trial
court
who
sent
it
back
to
the
coastal
commission
to
take
some
more
evidence,
did
then
decide
that
they
would
impose
the
least
restrictive
of
all
permit
conditions;
and
that
is,
the...
the
pass
and
repass
conditions.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
yes,
the
coastal
commission
does.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
yes.
the
individual
house,
perhaps
in
and
of
itself,
would
not
be
sufficient
to
cause
that
type
of
burden.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
the...
oh,
the
burden
on
the
visual
access
to
the
coast.
as
you
can
see
in
the
administrative
record,
there
are
studies,
and
there
are...
studies
not
only
of
this
tract
but
other...
other
tracts
which
show
that
one
of
the
purposes
behind
the
coastal
act
was
to
allow
the
public
to
have
access
to
its
own
public
lands.
and
one
of
the
most
important
areas
has
been
the
area
to
see
that
land;
to
know
that
your
public
beach
is
there;
and
be
able
to
get
there.
and
so--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--yes,
a
house.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
we
believe
that
that
house,
which
was
originally
521
square
feet,
and
then
is
in
excess
of
1,600
square
feet
and
two
stories
with
adjacent
garages,
is
a
very
different
house,
and
therefore,
a
new
development.
but
certainly,
if
it
were
only
that
house,
and
that
house
alone,
i'm
afraid
we
might
have
to
concede
that.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
but
it
is
all
the
other
houses.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
because
they
are
a
part
of
this
wall
of
houses
along
the
thousand
miles
of
the
coast
which
are
creating
a
wall
between
the
people
and
their
public
beaches.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
yes,
we
have.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
the
way
the
pacific
coast
highway
passes
this
area,
the
visions
for
the
persons
in
their
buses
and
in
their
cars
and
walking
along
is
obstructed
by
those
houses,
which
are
much
higher--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--it
is
one
of
the
burdens
that
this
house,
along
with
others,
has
place
on
the...
on
the
rights
of
the
public.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
our
position
is
that
there
are
a
variety
of
burdens
that
are
placed
by
this
construction
and
other
construction;
and
there
are
a
variety
of
purposes
that
are
served.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
it
is
a...
it's
the
other
side
of
that
coin
of
the
burden
on
access.
and
i
think
this
court
has
said
as
recently
as
in
footnote
21
of
keystone
that
the
actual
match
of
the
burden
and
what
the
individual
property
owner
gives
us
does
not
have
to
be
precise
or
exact.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
well,
i
think
it's
much
more
specific
than
that,
justice
scalia.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
the
logic
of
our
position
is
that
we
could
have
required
vertical
access.
this
is
not
a
vertical--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--in
this
particular
case,
where
we
have
a
specific
statute
which
is
grounded
in
the
california
constitutional
provision,
which
demands
that
we
give
maximum
access
to
the
public--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--but
it
isn't
a
payment
case.
it
is
a
case
that
says,
there
have
been
burdens
placed
on
the
public
based
on
your
development
of
new
development.
as
a
legislative
finding,
as
a
constitutional
finding,
california
has
said,
in
its
wisdom,
that
that
is
a
burden.
and
that
burden
must
be
paid
for
incrementally,
s
xx
ally,
sometimes
by
moderate...
moderate
losses
to
the
property
owner.
here
the
property
owner
gains
from
this,
also.
there
are
incremental
benefits
that
sometimes
arise
here.
this
property
owner,
who
may
have
lost
very
little...
a
right
to
exclude
people;
the
right
of
use
in
this
pass
and
repass...
is
gaining
from
that
very
same
condition--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--that
is
imposed
by
the
coastal
commission
on
all
similar
situated--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--he
too
is
gaining
that
right
to
walk
along
the
beach,
as
he--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--oh,
i'm
sorry,
justice
marshall.
of
course
he
had
the
right
to
walk
along
his
own
beach.
but
he
may
wish
to
go
further
than
in
front
of
his
own
private
home.
and
he
may
wish
not
to
pass
down
from
the
seawall,
and
to
walk
half
a
mile
up
to
a
public
beach,
or
a
half
a
mile
down.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
there
was
no
right
to
have
dune
buggies
running
around
there.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
well,
the
state
would
feel
very
strongly
about
the
damage
to
the
coast
from
dune
buggies
riding
along
there.
so--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--could
not
have
buses,
because
based
on
this
record--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--because
based
upon
this
record
the
state
took
evidence
showing
the...
the
fragile
nature
of
this
environment;
and
the
state
would
not
require
anything
but
this
very
minimal
intrusion
of
passing
and
repassing
right
next
to
the
public
beach,
and
perhaps
on
the
public
beach.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
they
are
passing
there
now.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
well,
but
this--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--well,
one
of
the
reasons
that
was
in
the
record
was
that
this
is
now
a
big
house
that's
going
to
last
a
long
time,
and
although
the
nollans--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--the
nollans
are
the
ones
who
are
giving
permission
at
this
time
to
let
people
pass.
the
nollans
are
doing
that--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--the
nollans
cannot
stop
them
well,
can
stop
them
now
if
this...
if
we
do
not
win
this
case.
but
the...
the
successors
in
interest
from
the
nollans
might
very
well
say,
we
don't
want
the
public
to
pass.
there
are
many
questions
about
the
ownership
of
this
property,
there
is
no
question
about
it,
in
terms
of
whether
it's
even
been
impliedly
dedicated
already.
but
the
coastal
commission
took
no
position
on
those
areas,
and
instead,
it
merely
wishes--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--no,
we
are
going
to
allow
the
public
to
walk
along
a
small
area--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--in
california,
sometimes
too
much.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
we
are
asking
a
property
owner
who
has--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--we
are
asking...
or
we
would
not
be
here...
we
are
asking
the
property
owner--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--well,
that's
a
legislative
judgment.
i
believe
under
our
california
constitutional
provision,
a
statute
such
as
you
suggest
might
very
well
not
only
pass,
but
pass
constitutional
muster
here
and
in
california.
but
the
legislature
made
a
different
judgment.
and
the
legislature
said
that
it
is
that
type
of
new
development
that
we
will
impose
this
type
of
a
condition.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
well,
the
guidelines
in
those
statutes
are,
any
development
which
is
in
excess
of
10
percent
of
the
footage.
however
if
you
see--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--it
compares
square
footage.
so
here,
of
course,
we
are
far
over
the
10
percent
figure;
it
is
not
even
close.
but
the
coastal
commission
has
the
power
to
define
new
development
within
that
statute;
and
it
has
that
guideline
that
anything
over
10
percent
shall
be
new
development.
if
i
may
then,
the...
to
return
to
my
point
that
i
do
believe
this
is
a
traditional
regulatory
permit
case,
i
do
believe
that
in
this
case,
the
intrusion
here,
contrary
to
some
of
the
arguments,
is...
is
extraordinarily
minimal.
and
there
are
the
questions
of
what
the
underlying
right
is
for
a
property
owner
to
exclude
in
such
a
case.
but
in
any
case,
this
very
small
passage
and
repassage
certainly
does
not
in
anyway
impose
anything
that
looks
like
a
loretto
type
taking
for
the
purposes
of
this
court.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
on
two
points.
the
same
person
passing
back
and
front
in
front
of
the
house
causes
and
raises
and
heightens
a
kind
of
concern
about
that
which
i
think
certainly
the
nollans
could
take
different
action--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--well,
you
may
not
wish
to...
the
nollans
may
not
wish
to,
but
they
may
indeed
wish
to
call
someone,
if
they
feel
threatened
or
in
fear,
if
that
is
the
allegation.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
but
as
to--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--unless
there
were
facts
to
show
that
this
was
a
harrassing
or
other--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--it
may
be
nicer,
but
if
you
have
built
new
development,
it
may
indeed
be
that
you
are
going
to
have
to
make
different
judgments.
the
coastal
commission
also
has
the
power
to
arrange
for
privacy
buffers.
the
statutory
scheme
is
quite
discretionary.
it
does
not
extend
as
far
as
the
constitutional
would
allow
us.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
well,
i'm
not
sure.
because
that
gets
to
his
reasonable
expectations.
and
here
we
have
had
a
coastal
commission
act.
we
have
had
a
california
constitution.
and
we
have
had
these
regulations.
and
when
he
actually
bought
this
house
in
1952,
all
of
them
were
in
place,
and
was
fully
aware
of
all
of
those
conditions.
so
i
am
not
sure
that
he
had
any
reasonable
expectation
of
anything
other
than
reasonable,
rational
regulation
by
the
coastal
commission.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
the
mere
announcement
does
not
make
what
was...
or
is
not...
does
not
make
it
constitutional.
under
these
facts
here,
the
nollans,
if
they
were
making
a
traditional
takings
argument,
i
think
are
ousted
from
that
argument
because
of
their
recognition
of
this
regulatory
scheme.
and
again,
what
we
would
say
is
a
regulatory
scheme
that
has
a
great
deal
of
discretion,
and
allows
the
property
owner
much
flexibility,
and
does
not
even
extend
as
far
as
the
state
constitution
and
the
united
states
constitution
would
allow
it
to
go.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
yes.
certainly
this
court
has
said
it
in
kaiser
aetna,
and
has
said
it
often.
and
of
course
it
is--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--that
it
is
an
important
aspect
of
the
property--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--i
will
say
it
was
of
central
importance.
i
would
say
in
kaiser
aetna,
the
reason
that
that
case
was
decided
differently
than
i
would
have
this
court
decide
this
case
is
a
situation
where
government,
unlike
government
here,
which
has
made
its
will
known
very
clearly,
government
and
the
corps
of
engineers
in
that
case
allowed
the
property
owner
to
spend
millions
of
dollars
to
develop
a
navigational
servitude,
and
once
that
navigational
servitude
existed,
government
came
in
years
later
and
said,
now
you
must
have
public
access.
so
that,
though
i
certainly
agree
as
a
general
proposition
of
the
importance
of
the
right
to
exclude,
the
decision
in
kaiser
versus
aetna
does
not
assist,
i
believe,
in
deciding
this
case.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
i
do
concede
that.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
i
concede
that
it
not
only--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--the
crux...
i
do
believe
it
may
be
two-part
analysis.
but
the
very
first
analysis
is
exactly
as
your
honor
suggests;
that
indeed,
we
look
to
see
if
theta
has
been
a
rational
and
reasonable
relationship
or
nexus
between
the
harm
being
sought
to
be
obviated
and
the
nature
of
the
action.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
that's
right.
because,
again,
reasonable
and
rational
does
not
mean
exactitude.
and
here,
we
are
looking
at
all
of
the
burdens
on
access.
and
one
of
the
access,
because
it
happens
to
be
visual,
is
the
burden,
access
along
the
beachfront
and
the
walking
is
a
way
of
compensating.
there
could
have
been
other
ways.
he
could
have--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--that
might
be
an
analysis
that
the
legislation
would
have...
would
have
determined.
our
legislature
did
not.
and
in
fact,
that
kind
of
analysis
might
lead--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--yes.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
absolutely.
great
deference,
clearly
to
the
legislative
body;
but
absolutely,
that
is
right.
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
time...
not
time
and
place,
but
size
and
place
of
the
structure
might
very
well
be
a
much
more
substantial
taking
in
the
generic
sense
than
anything
like
walking
along
the
beach.
if
in
fact
we
had
denied
the
permit
altogether,
or
if
in
fact
we
said,
you
may
not
build
a
second
story,
certainly
many,
many
homeowners
would
say
that
that
was
much
more
obstructive
and
much
more
intrusive
into
their
private
rights.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
access,
we
say,
and
have
said
through
the
statutes
and
through
the
regulations,
is
a
term
which
includes
ability
to
enjoy
the
beach.
and
there
are
many
ways
that
you
are
forbidden
from
enjoying
that
beach.
congrestion,
lack
of
parking
lots,
the
inability
to
see
the
beach,
private
dwellings;
a
whole
variety
of
areas.
so
it
is
the
larger
picture
of
access
that
we
are
trying
to
fix.
and
we
have
made
that
judgment
that
insofar
as
access,
the
visual
access,
has
been
cut
off,
and
other
burdens
that
this
house
may
place
on
the...
on
the
public,
that
we
look
to
ways
to
compensate.
and
you
can
compensate
it
by
vertical
access
is
good.
no,
i...
i--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--well,
we
are
not
talking
about
big
gain
or
small
gain
or
good
or
bad.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
what
we
are
talking
about
is
the
upholding
of
a
regulatory
scheme
which
is
designed
to
make
gains,
and
has
done
it
very
slowly,
and
very
ponderously.
and
here
we're
hopeful
that
the
conditions
will
be
held
to
be
a
reasonable
exercise
of
the
police
power.
the...
whether
the
half
a
mile
away
a
bus
stop
would
be
reasonable
would
differ
among...
among
various
municipalities.
certainly
in
many
dedication
cases,
there
are
in
lieu
fees.
some
of
the
state
cases
that
we
talk
about
in
our
brief,
remmenga
is
a
payment
in
lieu,
and
then
payment
is
mae
somewhere
else.
that
has
traditionally
been
upheld
by
this
court
as
a
rational,
reasonable
relationship.
and
so
it
might
very
well
apply
here.
one
of
the
arguments,
of
course,
that
has
been
made
in
the
briefs
is
that
there
isn't
sufficient
information
on
tie
taking
issue
in
this...
in
this
record
for
this
court
to
make
a
final
decision.
i
would
only
submit
to
this
court
that
in
fact,
there
is
sufficient
information.
the
court
of
appeal
record
here
is
definitely
brief;
there
is
no
question
about
that.
but
i
think
we
have
to
recognize
that
the
court
of
appeal,
when
it
did
its
taking
analysis,
came
at
the
end
of
three
other
california
cases,
three
of
which
this
court
had
not
granted
hearing.
and
therefore,
the
short
analysis
in
the
court
of
appeal
of
what
the
requirements
of
the
federal
constitution
and
the
state
constitution
more
than
suffices
to
show
that
an
adequate
examination
of
this
court's
cases
in
loretto,
this
court's
cases
in
penn
central,
were
analyzed
and
found
not
to
be
a
taking.
if
there
are
no
further
questions--
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
--yes?
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
no,
there
is
not.
and
of
course
it
is
california's
position
that
that
was
the
burden
of
the
nollans.
the
nollans
had
the
opportunity
and
the
ability
to
put
some...
some
information
into
the
record
on
the
diminution
of
value,
if
any.
it
is
our
position,
of
course,
that
that
diminution
would
be
minimal,
and
certainly,
in
no
way,
reduces
their
reasonable
expectations.
they
have
value
given
to
them
by
this
permit.
the
ability
to
increase
the
value
of
their
lot
and
their
house
by
the
structure;
and
whatever
value
might
be
put
on
it
at
some
later
time
and
some
later
place
of
this
right
to
access,
there
is
no
showing
that
in
any
way
they
have
been
damaged
financially.
ms.
andrea
sheridan
ordin
thank
you.
