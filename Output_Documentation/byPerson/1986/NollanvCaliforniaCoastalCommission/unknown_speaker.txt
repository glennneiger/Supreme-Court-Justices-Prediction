unknown
speaker
mr.
best,
may
i
ask
you
to
address
a
preliminary
question
that
is
troubling
me.
the
allegation
of
california
is
that
the
nollans
went
ahead
during
the
litigation
and
rebuilt
the
house,
and
that
under
california
law,
that
amounts
to
a
waiver
of
their
right
to
challenge
the
constitutionality
of
the
permit.
how
is
that
dealt
with
below?
and
what
is
your
response
to
that
problem?
unknown
speaker
was
the
construction...
is
it
a
fact
that
the
construction
was
carried
out
pending
this
litigation?
unknown
speaker
was
that
after
the
matter
was
heard
by
the
court
of
appeal
in
the
california
courts?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
do
you
expect
us
to
do?
to
decide
the
california
law
question
here?
unknown
speaker
well,
we'd
have
to
decide
that
then.
unknown
speaker
you
would
agree,
wouldn't
you,
mr.
best,
that
your
client
proceeds
at
his
peril
in
this
respect;
that
if
he
loses
here,
he's
then
bound
by
the
california
coastal
commission
requirement?
unknown
speaker
could
you
tell
me
precisely
what
the
access
right
would
be?
is
it
just
across
the
rear
of
your
property?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
through...
from
outside
your
property
down
to
the
beach?
unknown
speaker
it's
between
the
high
water
mark
and
what?
unknown
speaker
and
how
far
is
that?
unknown
speaker
and
that
is...
and
you
have
title
to
that?
unknown
speaker
and
if...
if...
if
you
lose
the
case,
then
people
may
not
only
cross...
cross
that
piece,
but
they
could
just
use
it?
unknown
speaker
they
couldn't
set
up
their
beach
chair
there,
and
sit
in
it?
unknown
speaker
they
could
surf
there,
too,
i
assume?
that
would
be
passing
and
repassing?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
not
when
it's
at
high
tide.
what
happens
when--
unknown
speaker
--may
i
ask,
mr.
best,
would
it
be
a
taking
under
your
view
of
the
case
if
they
insisted
on...
if
the
regulation
was
not
in
the
form
it
is,
but
said,
you
may
not
build
a
fence
along
the
side
to
interrupt
with
the
passage?
unknown
speaker
that
would
not
be--
unknown
speaker
--why
is
it
different
in
practical
effect
from
a
prohibition
against
putting
up
a
fence?
unknown
speaker
well,
that's
a
difference
in
legal
effect.
but
what's
the
difference
in
practical
effect,
for
a
person
living
there?
unknown
speaker
not
to
pass
through;
not
to
pass
through.
unknown
speaker
they
don't
lose
their
ability
to
ask
people
not
to
be
there.
if
the
people
stop,
as
i
understand
it,
they
can
ask
them
to
please
move
on.
unknown
speaker
but
the
thing
they
can't
do
is
interrupt
their
passage.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
that's
the
practical
equivalent
of
a
fence.
that's
all
a
fence
does.
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
win
this
case,
can't
you
put
up
a
fence?
unknown
speaker
most
people
don't
trespass
even
without
a
fence,
i
take
it?
you
have
fairly
law
abiding
people
in
california,
don't
you?
you
really
need
fences
to
stop
them
from
trespassing?
unknown
speaker
can
you
put
a...
if
you
win
this
case,
can
you
put
up
a
sign,
private
beach?
unknown
speaker
will
you
get
one?
can
you
get
one,
if
you
lose
this
case?
unknown
speaker
hold
your
breath.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
just
putting
a
line
on
the
seawall:
no
trespassing
from
point
a
to
point
b?
unknown
speaker
you
couldn't
even
do
that?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
win
this
case,
you
could
have
a...
you
could
hire
two
people,
one
in
one
chair
at
one
end
of
the
private
property,
and
one
in
the
other
end,
and
say,
sorry,
don't
go
beyond
this
point?
unknown
speaker
i
mean
that
wouldn't
require
a
permit?
unknown
speaker
what
would
you
do
about
the
surfboard
that
came
in?
if
you
do
assign...
put
somebody
on
each
end,
you
can't
stop
that
man
from
coming
in?
unknown
speaker
mr.
best,
the...
the
other
side,
california
also
argues
that
the
state
already
effectively
holds
an
easement
by
virtue
of
the
california
constitution.
unknown
speaker
well,
one
would
think
that
if
that
were
the
constitution
of
california,
the
court
of
appeal
would
have
said
something
about
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what...
could
the...
suppose
you
had
applied
for
this
right
to
rebuild
this
house,
and
you
are
making
it
larger?
unknown
speaker
and
the
commission
just
said,
sorry,
no.
unknown
speaker
we
just
don't
want
a
house
built
there...
or
that
we
don't
want
it
rebuilt
there?
unknown
speaker
mr.
best,
what
is
the
accessway
that
they
have
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
going
to
happen
when
you
lose
here?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
and
what
will
that
mean?
unknown
speaker
which
everybody
is
using
right
now?
unknown
speaker
right
now.
well,
they're
the
public,
aren't
they?
unknown
speaker
what
else
do
they
lose?
unknown
speaker
their
feelings
are
hurt.
unknown
speaker
their
feelings
are
hurt?
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
unknown
speaker
how
high
is
the
seawall?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
it
was
about
eight
feet
high.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
when
the
water
is
adjacent
to
it,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
so
that
people,
even
under
your
view,
could
use
that
ten
feet--
unknown
speaker
--but
they
can't
come
across
that--
unknown
speaker
--the...
how
often
is
your
beach
useable
at
all?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
isn't
it
rocky,
sometimes?
if
there's
no
sand,
what's
there?
unknown
speaker
is
this
house
at
risk
from
being
undermined
by
the
sea?
unknown
speaker
mr.
best,
supposing
that
the
seawall
had
not
been
built
on
this
property,
and
your
clients
applied
for
permission
to
build
a
new
house
with...
and
construct
a
seawall
that
was
going
to
be
perhaps
eight
or
ten
feet
high.
and
the
commission
says,
we're
not
going
to
let
you...
we're
not
going
to
let
you
build
the
seawall
because
that's
going
to
cut
off
people's
view
from
the
road.
do
you
think
there's
anything
wrong
with
that
sort
of
a
condition?
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--supposing
it
doesn't
make
it
worthless.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
about
typical
zoning...
or
zoning
requirements
that,
if
there's
going
to
be
a
new
subdivision
developed,
that
the
owners
have
to
dedicate
land
for
public
streets
and
rights
of
way?
is
that
similar
to
your
case?
do
you
think
that
government
can
extract
that
kind
of
a
dedication?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
going
to
be
all
right
under
your
view
of
the
constitutional
requirements
under
the
takings
clause?
does
the
balance...
can
the
balance
come
but
differently
and
be
constitutional?
unknown
speaker
can
the
city,
for
instance,
in
one
of
these
developments,
require
a
dedication
of
land
for
a
school
or
a
park
because
of
the
population
that's
going
to
be
using
this
new
subdivision?
unknown
speaker
and
roads?
unknown
speaker
mr.
best,
could
i
interrupt
you
just
a
second.
do
i
correctly...
i
don't
want
to
misstate
your
argument.
if
i
understand
you,
you're
saying
that
if
they
had
a
regulation
of
use
which,
in
substance,
said
to
the
nollans
you
may
not
use
this
property
in
anyway
that
will
interfere
with
the
public's
walking
past
without
loitering
or
stopping,
that
would
be
permissible.
you
can't
put
up
a
fence
or
a
sign
or
you
can't
put
a
guard
out.
the
regulation
of
use
would
be
permissible.
unknown
speaker
but
what's
wrong
is,
precisely
the
same
objective
is
accomplished
because
there's
a
dedication?
unknown
speaker
well,
specifically,
nothing
that
will
prevent
a
member
of
the
public
from
walking
from
point
a
to
point
b;
that's
the
use.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
regulation
was
use,
you
may
not
put
up
signs
or
have
anyone
out
there
orally
advising
them
not
to
do
it?
unknown
speaker
you
can't
sue
somebody
for--
unknown
speaker
--that's
where
you
draw
the
line.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
has
to
depend
on
how
much
sand
there
happens
to
be
in,
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
where...
is
it
ventura
county?
unknown
speaker
ms.
ordin,
does
the
coastal
commission
contend
here
that
the
pass
and
repass
easement
is
necessitated
in
anyway
by
the
change
in
the
house
that's
going
to
be
on
the
property?
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
explain
how
that
goes?
unknown
speaker
to
cause
what
type
of
burden?
unknown
speaker
well,
there
was
already
a
house
there,
though?
unknown
speaker
so
i
don't
see
how
that's
much
of
a
burden.
there
was
a...
it's
a
replacement
of
one
house
for
another,
so
your
argument
there
seems
quite
weak
frankly.
unknown
speaker
well--
unknown
speaker
--what's
that
got
to
do
with--
--why
should
the
nollans
be
held
responsible
for
all
the
other
houses?
unknown
speaker
well,
it's
a
visual
wall
you've
been
talking
about.
unknown
speaker
but
what...
i
would
suppose
the
coastal
commission
could
solve
the
public's
right
to
be
able
to
see
the
ocean
without
requiring
a
property
owner
to
allow
access
across
the
rear
of
his
property.
what's
that
got
to
do
with
vision?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
agree...
i
agree
with
that.
but
what's
that
lot
to
do
with
the
right
of
way
across
the
rear
of
the
property?
unknown
speaker
but
how
does
the
easement
alleviate
that
burden?
it
doesn't
enable
anyone
to
see
better
from
the
bus?
unknown
speaker
well,
before
the
house...
before
the
property
owner...
before
this
property
wanted
to
be
expanded,
before
the
owner
wanted
to
expand
it,
there
was
the
same
restriction
across
the
back
of
his
property.
why
did
expanding
the
house
increase
or
decrease
the
burden
on
the
public
access
along
the
beach?
unknown
speaker
well,
this
is
nowhere
near...
we're
not
arguing
whether
it's
precise
and
exact.
what
you
seem
to
be
arguing
is
that
if
you
do
anything
that's
going
to
harm
the
public
somehow,
we
can
make
you
cough
up
something
in
return
that'll
help
the
public,
whether
it's
related
or
not.
unknown
speaker
what
about
a
vertical
right
of
access?
i
assume
that
the
logic
of
your
position
is
that
you
could
have
required
vertical
access
here,
too?
unknown
speaker
so
everybody
along
that
coast
could
be
required
to
let
the
public
pass
from
the
road
with
an
easement
across
their
land
without
any
compensation
by
the
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
can
pay
for
it
and
comply
with
the
constitution,
i
mean,
right?
unknown
speaker
what?
unknown
speaker
what
is
he
gaining?
unknown
speaker
well,
didn't
he...
the
owner
didn't
have
the
right
to
walk
along
the
beach?
his
own
beach?
unknown
speaker
well,
that
doesn't...
did
this
fellow
had
dune
buggies
running
around
there?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
to
stop
the
state
from
giving
him
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
could
they
have
buses?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
do
they
need
to
take...
they're
passing
there
now,
right?
unknown
speaker
why
give
them
the
right
to
pass
when
they're
already
passing?
unknown
speaker
there
must
be
some
other
reason.
there
must
be
another
reason.
unknown
speaker
i'm
not
talking
about
the
house;
i'm
talking
about
the
beach.
what
changed
the
beach,
now?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
are
they
going
to
stop
them?
unknown
speaker
you
just
walked
in
and
said,
we're
going
to
have
a
highway
in
front
of
your
house.
unknown
speaker
well,
does
the
public
usually
walk
along
a
highway?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
do.
so
that's
what
they're
going...
they're
going
to
open
this
up,
what
is
now
a
private
highway,
and
make
it
a
public
highway.
unknown
speaker
[inaudible]
unknown
speaker
well,
please
don't
ask
me...
if
that's
what--
--i
don't
see
why
you
tie
it
to
the,
you
know,
to
the
alteration
in
the
house.
this
is
an
important
state
interest,
i
suppose.
why
don't
you
just
do
the
same
for
all
houses,
whether
they...
you
know,
the
person
who
is
lucky
enough
to
have
modernized
their
house
a
couple
of
years
before
the
california
coastal
act
went
into
effect
doesn't
have
to
give
you
an
easement,
i...
you
have
to
pay
for
that
one
from
that
other
person
who's
already
modernized
his
house?
but
this
person,
since
he
wants
to
modernize
the
house,
has
to
give
it
to
you
for
free.
that
doesn't
seem
fair,
somehow.
unknown
speaker
what
type
of
new
development?
it
sounds
like
all
types
of
new
development.
unknown
speaker
square...
square
footage?
it's
a
comparison
of
square
footage
or
lineal
footage?
unknown
speaker
how
far
is
the
seawall
from
the
back
of
this
house
here?
let's
assume
that
there...
that
whoever
lives
in
the
house
has
little
children,
or
even,
they
don't
have
little
children.
they
have
a
back
window
there
overlooking
the
sea,
which
they
normally
want
to
have
open.
now,
i
wouldn't
consider
it
a
minimal
intrusion
at
all
if
your
backyard
is,
what,
seven
feet,
and
then
there's
the
seawall.
and
when
the
sand's
all
the
way
up
there,
the
seawall
is,
let's
say,
four
feet
high.
and
let's
assume
there's
a
person
down
the
street
that
i
think...
i
don't
trust
him.
i
mean,
he
just
looks
shifty
eyed.
and
he
takes
to
walking
back
and
forth
seven
feet
away
from
my
back
window,
back
and
forth;
back
and
forth.
i
can't
stop
him,
so
long
as
he
keeps
going
back
and
forth,
right?
gooking
into
my
house
and--
unknown
speaker
--what
different
action?
i
can't
stop
them.
the
person
hasn't
done
anything.
unknown
speaker
no,
they
just
don't
like
the
fellow
walking
back
and
forth
and
looking
into
their
house
constantly.
it
makes
them--
unknown
speaker
--they
couldn't
stop
that,
could
they,
unless
there
were
some--
unknown
speaker
--i'd
much
rather
have
another
15
feet
beyond
my
property
to
keep
them
that
much
further
off.
wouldn't
that
be
nicer?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
nollan
thought
he
bought
a
privacy
buffer.
i
mean,
that's
the
point.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
so
long
as
the
things
that
california
couldn't
do
previous...
to
existing
landowners,
they
can
do
in
the
future
by
just
saying,
in
the
future
we
are...
we
want
you
all
to
be
on
notice,
we
can
take
easements
over
your
land.
and
although
prior
to
their
saying
that,
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional,
the
mere
fact
that
they
have
disrupted
investor
expectations
by
announcing
that
in
the
future,
though
it's
unconstitutional,
that
they're
going
to
do
it,
that
that
changes
thing's?
unknown
speaker
ms.
ordin?
yes.
didn't
the
case
we
had
in
kaiser
aetna
say
that
the
right
to
exclude
is
of
central
importance
to
a
property
owner?
unknown
speaker
and
do
you
agree?
unknown
speaker
of
central
importance
to
the
property
owner.
unknown
speaker
you
concede
that
there
has
to
be
a
reasonable
relationship
between
the
contemplated
use
of
the
land
and
the
condition
that
government
extracts--
unknown
speaker
--in
exchange
for
the
permit?
unknown
speaker
so
this
case
then
turns
on
whether
such
a
reasonable
relationship
exists?
is
that
the
crux
of
this
case,
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
and
so
some
might
think
that
the
state
is
limited
in
its
concern
about
the
visual
burden
to
regulations
that
limit
the
height
of
the
structure
or
the
size
of
it.
but
you
say
it
goes
beyond
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
i...
i
might
be
inclined
to
think
that
the
reasonable
nexus
would
be
limited
to
regulations
of
the
size,
location
and
so
forth
of
the
structure
itself.
unknown
speaker
but
if
that...
if
the
reasonable
relationship
or
the
nexus
is
part
of
the
constitutional
balance,
then
that's
something
the
court
has
to
be
concerned
about
as
well.
unknown
speaker
it
isn't
totally
left
up
to
the
legislative
body,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but,
ms.
ordin,
may
i
follow
up
on
justice
o'connor's
question?
the
burden
here
is
on
visual
access
of
the
beautiful
ocean
and
the
shore.
it
seems
to
me
you've
alleviated
that
harm.
it
seems
to
me
you
might
argue,
had
you
given...
required
vertical
access,
you
might
say,
well,
they
can
park
the
bus
and
get
out
and
walk
to
the
beach
and
therefore
see
what
they
otherwise
couldn't
see.
that
might
be
related.
but
how
does
horizontal
access
respond
to
the
particular
burden
you've
described?
unknown
speaker
because
this
serves
entirely
different
people.
that
is,
the
people
who
drive
by
in
the
bus
still
can't
see
the
shore,
but
at
least
there'll
be
some
other
people,
surfers
or
whoever,
who
can
walk
a
long
the
wall
and
look
into
this
fellow's
house.
of
course
it
may
be,
there
won't
be
anybody.
it
may
be
that
his
two
neighbors
aren't
subject
to
this
passage
requirement.
and
so
nobody
can
cross
their
property,
and
hence,
nobody
can
cross
this
fellow's
except
his
two
neighbors.
big
gain.
unknown
speaker
we
certainly
aren't,
you're
right.
unknown
speaker
i
have
just
one.
unknown
speaker
is
there
anything
in
the
record
to
tell
us
what
the
market
value
of
this
particular
dispute
is?
unknown
speaker
but
mr.
best,
let
me
just
ask
you
right
there.
suppose
well
in
advance
of
this
conveyance
they
had
passed
a
law
that
said,
there
shall
be
no
further
development
of
property
that
improves...
increases
the
interruption
of
visibility
unless
this
action
is
granted.
just
a
flat
rule
across
the
board.
would
you
then
say
that
each
time
a
piece
was
granted,
you
have
to
test
the
particular
property?
or
could
you
test
it
on
a
general
basis?
i
don't
know
is
that
question
is
clear
or
not.
unknown
speaker
no,
no,
my
question
is,
if
they
can
justify
it
as
a
whole,
would
that
mean
that
any
particular
property
owner
could
get
in
effect
an
exemption
from
it
by
saying,
yes,
but
the
reason
for
the
rule
really
doesn't
apply
to
my
property,
because
i'm
only
slightly
enlarging
the
house?
unknown
speaker
was
the
house
longer
from
side
to
side
that
it
was?
