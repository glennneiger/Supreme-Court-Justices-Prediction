mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
i
think
it
very
clearly
does,
justice
white,
because
it
defines
the
deemer
clause,
not
a
clause
which
is
necessarily
self
evident
on
its
meaning
on
first
reading.
but
the
court
in
metropolitan
said
that
the
deemer
clause
takes
out
of
the
saving
clause
state
insurance
laws
when
they
apply
directly
to
employee
benefit
plans.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
for
us
to
prevail,
no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't.
i
think
that
the
case
is
great
for
us
because
it
does
define
the
deemer
clause.
it
says,
the
court
says,
we
aren't
going
to
limit
the
deemer
clause
any
further
than
congress
has
limited
it
in
the
clause
itself,
and
that's,
the
court
says,
we're
not
going
to
limit
the
insurance
saving
clause
any
more
than
congress
has
limited
it
in
the
clause
itself
and
in
the
deemer
clause,
and
that's
good
enough
for
us.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
says
that
this
is
a
case
in
which
congressional
intent
is
to
be
discerned,
and
i
agree.
fortunately
and
rarely
in
this
particular
case,
congress
has
expressly
stated
in
the
saving
clause
itself,
its
intent,
its
intent
to
save
from
preemption
state
laws
which
regulate
insurance.
we
don't
have
to
look
anywhere
else.
and,
indeed,
it
says
it
in
the
language
of
statutory
construction.
it
says,
don't
construe
any
other
provision
in
this
whole
erisa
as
exempting
or
relieving
any
person
from
state
laws.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
from
the
law
of
any
state,
you're
right,
which
regulates
insurance.
now,
the
distinction
between
the
law
of
any
state
and
state
laws,
i
think,
is
one
that
was
made
in
petitioner's
brief,
but
which
was
rejected
as
not
significant
in
the
brief
of
the
united
states.
this
court
used
the
term
"state
law"
in
describing
the
preemptive
effect
in
the
metropolitan
life
decision.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
no,
sir.
but,
the
legislative
history
also
says
it,
and
it
uses
the
term
"state
law",
and
indeed,
of
course,
the
presumption
is
against
preemption.
and
indeed,
section
514(b)(2)
says
nothing
in
erisa
shall
be
construed.
that
includes
514(c),
which
has
the
definition
and
which
the
slight
change
in
language
is
present.
so--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
it
certainly
would
be.
and--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
that's
certainly
true
and
the
important
thing
about
that
is,
that's
the
distinction
that
the
deemer
clause
makes.
if
the,
if
that
same
regulation
purported
to
regulate
plans
by
calling
plans
insurance
companies--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--it
wouldn't
work.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
absolutely,
if
it's
an
insured
plan.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
and,
that's
the
distinction.
the
distinction
is
between
insured
and
self-insured
plans.
and,
the
reason
is--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--absolutely.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
your
honor,
that's
certainly
the
argument
the
petitioner
is
making.
in
doing
so,
petitioner
is
failing
to
look
at
the
precise
language
of
the
deemer
clause
which
says
expressly,
that
no
plan
or
trustee
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
insurance
company
or
in
the
business
of
insurance.
in
other
words,
the
deemer
clause
comes
in
to
limit
the
savings
clause.
the
savings
clause
says--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--yes.
yes,
your
honor.
but,
the
deemer
clause
only
limits
the
savings
clause
and
the
distinction
has
been
made
by
this
court
in
the
metropolitan
life
decision
between
direct
and
indirect
regulation
of
plans.
this
court
has
said
that
regulating
an
insurance
company
and
an
insurance-funded
plan
may
in
fact
cause
some
consequences
on
the
plan.
but,
that's
okay,
because
congress
has
said
so
and
we're
not
in
the
position
to
decide
congress
was
wrong.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
metropolitan
life
case,
i
think
you
absolutely
do
have
to
cut
back
on
the
language
if
you
don't
find
for
us.
what
the
insurance
companies
want
in
this
case,
of
course,
is
no
regulation
at
all.
they
choose
state
regulation
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act,
because
federal
regulation
is
serious
on
the
antitrust
laws.
they
now
see
that
state
regulation
in
the
developing
common
law
of
bad
faith
is
serious
and
they
will
have
to
do
what
they
promised
to
do
and
pay
claims
that
they
owe
and
not
cheat
their
insured's,
so
they
say,
wait
a
minute,
erisa's
designed
to
take
care
of
this.
i
submit
that
congress
has
made
this
intent
clear
and
if
the
insurance
companies
want
to
take
this
up
with
somebody
they
ought
to
take
it
up
with
congress.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
in
the
case
of
insured
plans,
i
do,
because
congress
says
so
in
the
saving
clause.
it
saves
insurance
regulations.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
i
don't
think
they
backed
out
of
it
under
the
deemer
clause.
in
the
deemer
clause,
all
that's
said
is
you
cannot
sneakily
regulate
a
plan
by
calling
it
insurance.
we're
not
calling
it
insurance.
now,
there's
a
difference
that
ought
to
be
drawn
and
notice
here
between
administrative
services.
an
insurance
company
can
wear
two
different
hats.
it
can
simply
come
in
and
perform
administrative
services
and
that's
all
it
does.
if
it
does
that
it's
not
an
insured
plan.
and,
if
it's
not
an
insured
plan,
all
of
erisa,
including
the
specific
enforcement
remedies,
applies.
if
on
the
other
hand,
it
wore
only
the
hat
of
insurance
company
selling
a
policy
to
an
insured
then
it
would
be
clear.
we
wouldn't
have
that
problem
of
civil
enforcement.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--first
of
all,
the
insurance
companies
don't
usually
act
as
trustees;
they
act
as
plan
administrators.
but
there's
still
a
serious
disadvantage
on
that
point.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
and
the,
but
the
disadvantage
does
not
apply
if
that's
all
they
act
as.
in
other
words,
the
only
disadvantage
applies
if
they
sell
insurance
policies.
and
that's
because
state
law
controls
that.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
xxx...
control
it.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
first
of
all,
some
of...
if
they
only
act
as
administrators
there's
no
problem.
it's
only
when
they
sell
insurance.
you're
exactly
right,
mr.
justice.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
well,
they
may
be
insurance
companies
for
other
purposes,
but
plenty
of
them
perform
administrative
services
only
now.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
no,
sir.
and
the
reason
is
the
metropolitan
life
case
makes
clear
that
in
the
case
of
self-insured
plans,
self-funded
plans,
the
savings
clause
does
not
apply
because
the
deemer
clause
eats
it
up.
but
in
the
case
of
insured
plan--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--would
not
apply.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
the
difference...
and
this
distinction
is
made
in
the
metropolitan
decision.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
no,
ma'am.
there
are
statistics
that
are
offered
by
the
petitioner
in
the
united
states
in
their
brief.
obviously
it's
a
lot
of
them
because
of
the
interest
that's
been
drawn
by
the
insurance
industry.
i
do
think
that
it
will
have
a
consequence.
the
consequence
will
be
that
the
beneficiaries
of
these
plans,
the
small
plans,
will
get
state
law
protection
when
that
state
has
decided
that
it's
important
to
have
claims
paid.
erisa
after
all
was
not
drafted
to
protect
insurance
industries.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
the
conflicting
policies
which
this
court
recognized
in
metropolitan
life,
it
said,
leave
it
to
congress.
congress
drafted
the
statute
in
which
these
two
policies
go
different
directions.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
will--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--i
have
a
bunch
of
cases
like
that.
penrod
does
it,
for
example.
they
use
life
insurance
company
of
the
southwest
to
perform
administrative
services
only.
bordens
uses
metropolitan
to
perform
administrative
services
only,
and
i've
experienced
that.
as
to
the
cost,
i
don't
understand
exactly
why
insurance
companies
say,
if
we're
forced
to
pay
punitive
damages
when
we
cheat
our
insureds,
we're
going
to
have
raise
rates.
that's
what
bad
faith
is
about.
that's
like
las
vegas
saying
that
if
we,
if
we're
going
to
have
to
have
a
square
table--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
if
they
choose
to
do
so,
let
them
come
to
congress
and
get
an
amendment
to
this
statute
and
provide
the
information.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
they
refuse
to
do
that.
across
the
board
they
refuse
to
provide
information
about
these
losses
they
claim.
if
they
want
it,
let
them
come
to
congress
instead
of
this
court,
which
is
not
a
body
that's
specifically
designed
to
take
care
of
this.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
well,
i'm
not
sure
what
congress
contemplated,
except
i
know
what
congress
said,
and
congress
said
that
insurance
regulation
is
saved
and
said
it
broadly
and
this
court
has
agreed
and
read
the
statute
and
refused
to
limit
it
beyond
what
congress
has
done.
and
congress
has
had
an
opportunity
to
change
that
as
this
court
pointed
out
in
metropolitan,
and
yet
it's
not
done
so.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
i'm
sure
those
figures
were
accurate
at
the
time.
it
was
about
1980.
and,
my
personal
experience
has
been
that
insurance
companies
are
already
changing
over
to
administrative
services
only,
at
least
in
the
large
companies
and
that
may
have
changed
somewhat.
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and,
of
course,
if
this
court
decided,
which
it
has
not
clearly
decided,
the
question
of
punitive
damages
under
erisa,
in
the
russell
case,
of
course,
it's
been
pointed
out
that
that
was
reserved,
and,
while
there's
been
a
suggestion
made
that
courts
of
equity
may
not
award
punitive
damages,
in
mississippi
they
may.
and
i
think
in,
generally
they
may,
although
i'm
not
sure
they
would
reward
them
for
breach
of
trust
quite
in
this
context.
but,
if
this
court
decided
to
allow
punitive
damages
to
protect
the
plan
beneficiaries,
the
people
erisa
was
designed
to
protect,
then
insurance
companies
would
all
of
a
sudden
be
reading
the
savings
clause
very
differently.
because
that's
what
this
is
about...
the
question
of
whether
insurance
companies
are
going
to
be
made
to
pay
what
they've
already
promised
to
pay
in
the
first
place,
or
whether
they're
going
to
be
able
to
be
outside
the
law
altogether.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
want
them
to
pay
what
they
owe
before
somebody
sues
them.
i
want
them
to
know
that
if
they
don't
go
ahead
and
pay
and
live
up
to
their
obligations
they
will
have
to
pay
more
later.
if
the
most
they
will
have
to
pay
is
what
they
owed
anyway,
and
if
a
litigant
has
got
to
hire
an
attorney...
and
by
the
way,
attorney's
fees
are
not
automatic
under
erisa;
it's
within
the
judge's
discretion
whether
the
plaintiff's
attorney
even
gets
attorney's
fees...
i
want
them
to
have
to
treat
their
insureds
fairly
from
the
beginning.
mississippi
bad
faith
law--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
agree
with
you.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
although
that
statute
has...
i
think
some
of
this
court's
decisions
have
suggested
that
that
includes
at
least
administrative
regulation
in
addition
to
legislation.
and,
of
course,
the
erisa
provision
very--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--the
court
has
not
expressly
said
that.
it
hasn't
expressly
not
said
it.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
it
may
cover
decisional
law,
but
i
don't
think
that
that's
important
for
this
case.
i
think
this
case
has
erisa
which
very
expressly
deals
with
the
problem
and
makes
clear
in
the
statute
itself
the
decisional
law
is
included.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
no,
sir.
i
think
in
both
cases
congress--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--i'm
not
sure
they
have
exactly
the
same
scope.
i
think
in
both
cases
congress
was
trying
its
best
to
allow
insurance
companies
to
avoid
federal
regulation
and
to
live
where
they
were
happy
to
live
in
the
various
states.
now
the
insurance
companies
aren't
happy
there
because
of
bad
faith
and
they're
trying
to
come
back
under
the
umbrella
of
erisa.
now,
i
do
think
that
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
the
saving,
and
the
regulation
of
insurance
question
is
certainly
related,
as
this
court
has
said
in
metropolitan
life,
to
the
questions
here
in
erisa.
but,
i
think
it
comes
down
the
same
way,
as
this
court
said
in
the--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--well,
there's
a--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
so
because
there's
a
presumption
against
preemption.
and,
to
use
the
strained
distinction
between
any
law
of
any
state
and
state
law
then
i
believe
there
is
a
presumption
against.
you
all
said
in
metropolitan
life
that
there
was
a
presumption
against
preemption
and
apply,
and
use
that
language
in
interpreting
the
savings
clause.
and
i
think
that
if
any
presumption
against
preemption
is
applied
certainly
this
kind
of
what
i
would
view
as
restrained
construction,
this
distinction
should
not
be
drawn.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
know.
this--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--as
far
as
i
know
it
was
not.
i
don't
know.
i
don't
think
that's
part
of
the
record
anywhere.
this
case
was
brought
at
a
time
when
nobody
much
knew
erisa
was
around,
neither
the
plaintiff
nor
the
defendant.
the
defendant
found
out
about
it
a
couple
of
years
later
and
amended
its
answer,
and
i'm
not
sure
about
that.
well,
mississippi
bad
faith
law
and
indeed
any
common
law
of
general
application,
although
mississippi
bad
faith
law
specifically
focuses
on
insurance
and
thus
does
not
fall
within
that
argument
that's
made,
an
argument
that
i
don't
accept
by
the
petitioners.
certainly,
it's
designed
to
focus
upon
the
insurance
industry.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
to
force
the
insurance
industry
to
do
what
it
ought
to
do
and
to
protect
the
people
that
erisa
is
designed
to
protect.
happily
it
does
that
as
well.
since
it
is
a
state
law
which
regulates
insurance,
since
this
court
has
said
that
that's
where
the
inquiry
stops,
since
in
its
reply
brief
the
petitioner
has
almost
admitted
that
even
if
it
is
a
state
law
which
regulates
insurance
they
still
win,
the
language
in
the
metropolitan
case,
correctly
decided
in
my
view,
of
course,
is
that
that's
where
the
inquiry
stops.
there's
a
state
law
which
regulates
insurance.
it
is
therefore
saved
from
preemption.
this
is
an
insured
rather
than
a
non-insured
plan.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
to
regulate
it.
of
course,
as
dean
keaton
has
said,
and
as
his
footnote
in
the
u.s.
brief
points
out,
that's
the
way
insurance
is
basically
regulated,
through
court
decision
which
interprets
meanings
of
policies--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--i
think
first
of
all,
the
mississippi
statute
of
frauds
might
not
relate
to
the
plan
in
the
first
place.
in
other
words,
it
might
not
fit
under
514(a)
in
the
beginning.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
since...
if
some
special
wrinkle
developed
to
deal
with
insurance
policies,
i
would
say
it
did.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
well,
you're
asking
me
makes
some
assumptions
that
are
not
correct,
but
for
purposes
of
argument
i
would
say
that
a
law
of
general
application,
first
of
all,
if
it's
that
general,
is
not
going
to
be,
is
not
going
to
relate
to
the
plan.
secondly,
assuming--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--because
it's
got
to
focus
on
the
plan
in
some
way,
some
manner
to
relate
to
the
plan.
i
mean,
i'm
not
really
prepared--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--no,
sir.
to
fit
under
514(a)
it
doesn't
take
too
much.
and,
of
course,
since
that's
not
the
issue
in
this
case,
since
we've
admitted
that
what
we've
got
fits
under
514(a),
i
can't
point
out
the
nuances
to
you.
but,
a
law
of
general
application
that
applies
equally,
then
perhaps
there's
no
reason
to
view
it
as
insurance
regulation.
but,
a
law
of
general
application,
to
simply
use
that
phrase,
"general
application",
when
in
fact
it
is
applied
to
the
insurance
industry
or
insurance
contracts,
or
insurance
claims
handling
in
a
specific
way,
then
that
regulates
insurance.
and,
all
insurance
teachers
agree
that
it
regulates
insurance.
and,
all
insurance
industry
agrees
as
well
that
it
regulates
insurance
xxx--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--first
of
all,
let
me
make
clear
that
respondent's,
i
mean
petitioner's
argument
in
his
reply
brief
that
any
intentional
refusal
to
pay
a
contract
justifies
punitive
damages,
is
clearly
contrary
to
mississippi
law,
contrary
to
cliver
wendell
holmes,
contrary
to
the
restatement
second
of
contracts,
section
355,
so
that's
not
the
general
law.
but,
assuming
that
it
were,
the...
if
it
is
not
applied
directly
or
in
any
way
more
significantly
toward
insurance
companies
than
anything
else,
then
i
don't
think
xxx--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--well,
let's
put
it
this
way,
we
do
have
a
rule
that
says
any
debtor
is
supposed
to
pay
his
debts.
all
right?
and,
if
he
doesn't
he's
got
to
pay
damages.
and
that's
the
general
contract
rule
that
was
modified
in
the
beall
case
in
which
the
court
applied
it
in
mississippi
law
for
insurance
companies.
that's
not
a
law
which
specifically
focuses
on
insurance.
it
has
not
been
applied
more
directly
toward
insurance
than
anything
else
as
far
as
i
can
tell
based
on
that
narrow
hypothesis.
and,
i
don't
think
that
it's,
that
it
would
be
saved;
frankly,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
necessary
for
it
to
be
saved.
the--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--it
says
"insurance
regulation".
in
other
words,
it
says
state
laws
which
regulate
insurance.
the
word
"regulate"
probably
means
something
and
the
question
is
what
precisely
does
it
mean.
it
clearly
includes
a
state
law
that's
designed
to
force
insurance
companies
to
pay
legitimate
claims.
the
question
is
does
it
include--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--it
certainly
may
xxx--
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
--it
certainly
may
do
that.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
no,
sir.
absolutely
not.
it
doesn't
seem
absurd
to
me.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
the
reason
i'm
having
difficulty,
i
believe,
is
because
the
hypothesis
is
one
that
i
think
will
be
taken
care
of
by
never
even
coming
up
because
of
it
not
relating
sufficiently
to
the
plan
in
the
first
place
under
514(a).
but
assuming
that
it
does,
i
agree
with
you,
there
is
no
reason
in
principle
to
draw
a
distinction
if
it
has
the
effect
of
regulating
and
if
that's
the
decision
that
this
court
wants
to...
wants
to
make,
if
it
has
the
effect
of
regulating,
fine.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
this
case
involves
state
law
regulating
insurance.
it
involves
state
law
that
was
expressly,
clearly
preserved
by
congress
in
the
statute
itself.
the
5th
circuit
correctly
construed
this
court's
opinion
in
metropolitan
life
and
recognizing
that
such
state
law
was
safe
from
preemption,
we
request
the
court
to
affirm
the
5th
circuit.
mr.
william
c.
walker,
jr.
no
further
questions?
