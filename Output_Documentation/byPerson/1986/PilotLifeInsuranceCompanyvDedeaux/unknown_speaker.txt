unknown
speaker
you
argued
that
case?
unknown
speaker
twice.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
only
if
they're
insurance
companies?
unknown
speaker
yes.
what
i'm
saying,
is
there
any
indication
that
congress
for
some
reason
didn't
want
insurance
companies
to
act
as
administrators,
because
that's
going
to
be
the
result
of
what
you're
saying.
and,
nobody
in
his
right
mind
is
going
to
have
an
insurance
company
act
as
administrator.
the
fees
are
going
to
go
up
so
much
that
it
will
make
it
impossible.
but,
other
companies
are,
just
can't
be
self-insurers;
they
can't
handle
it.
so
the
disadvantage
is
going
to
devolve
on
the
smaller
companies
who
either
buy
insurance
or
they
won't
have
their
plan.
unknown
speaker
why
do
you
say
that?
they're
not
insurance
companies
if
they
don't
sell
insurance,
right?
unknown
speaker
what
about...
i
don't
understand
your
position.
if
you
have
an
insurance
company
that
administers
a
plan
for
say,
general
motors
which
self-insures
the
payments
and
liability--
unknown
speaker
--would
not
your...
wouldn't
you
have
your
state
law
cause
of
action
in
that
case?
unknown
speaker
even
if
the
state
law
required
an
insurance
company
which
administers
all
sorts
of
insurance
to
avoid
bad
faith
denials
of
benefits
and
all
the
rest?
unknown
speaker
would
not
apply.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
walker,
do
you
happen
to
know
what
percentage
of
all
employees
covered
by
erisa
plans
are
covered
by
insurance
company
benefits
as
opposed
to
self-insured?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
it
was
partly
drafted
to
encourage
small
companies
to
have
such
plans
and
maybe
some
will
decide
it's
too
expensive.
and,
also
to
have
some
uniformity
in
the
administration
of
these
plans,
which
a
lot
of
them
cross
several
state
lines.
and
you
have
just
a
great
confusion
of
state
law.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walker,
do
you
know
of
any
company
that's
big
enough
to
be
a
self-insurer
and
yet
calls
in
an
insurance
company
just
to
administer
the
plan?
unknown
speaker
are
there
some
that
do
that?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
great
argument
in
theory,
but
if
the
insurance
company
has
lost
money
on
its
erisa
business
for
the
last
two
or
three
years,
i
can't
believe
that
they
aren't
going
to
raise
their
rates.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
certainly
is
an
argument.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
question
we're
considering
now
is
whether
congress,
in
enacting
erisa
with
the
various
preemption
savings
clause,
contemplating
the
sort
of
system
that
you're
urging
it
did.
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
have
any
reason
to
dispute
the
government's
figures
in
the
department
of
labor's
study
that
91
percent
of
health
plans
covering
fewer
than
a
hundred
employees
are
insured
plans
and
that
83
percent
of
those
with
over
a
hundred
employees
are
insured
plans?
unknown
speaker
that
would
certainly
be
the
trend.
unknown
speaker
if
you
win.
unknown
speaker
well,
under
erisa
you
can
sue
an
insurance
company
and
make
it
pay
what
it
promised
to
pay
in
the
first
place.
what
you
want
it
to
pay
is
a
lot
of
consequential
damages
that
might
of
resulted
from
its
failure
to
pay
what
it
promised
to
pay.
xxx.
unknown
speaker
mr.
walker,--
unknown
speaker
--you
say
insurance
companies
are
saved.
insurance
companies
were
also
saved
in
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
unknown
speaker
but,
congress
did
not
save
anything
except
legislation
governing
insurance
companies
there,
right?
unknown
speaker
now,
what--
unknown
speaker
--but
not,
but
surely
not
decisional
law.
unknown
speaker
oh,
you
think
the
mccarran-ferguson
may
cover
decisional?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
think
congress's
concern
for
state
authority
over
insurance
in
one
act
is
totally
unrelated
to
congress's
concern
for
state
authority
over
insurance
in
another
one?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
think
they
both
have
the
same
scope?
unknown
speaker
but,
the
language
here
is
ambiguous
if
you
assume
that
the
definition
of
a
law
of
any
state
is
not
necessarily
the
same
as
the
definition
contained
in
the
act
of
state
laws.
and
it's
not
the
same
phrase,
so
in
this
act,
it's
at
least
ambiguous
and
in
mccarran-ferguson
it's
pretty
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
that
it
doesn't
cover
decisional
law,
because
it
refers
there
to
any
law
enacted
by
any
state.
and,
it
says,
"unless
such
act
specifically
relates".
unknown
speaker
xxx
under
mccarran-ferguson
that
it
relates
to
legislation
and
perhaps
implementing
regulations,
so
if
the
two
have
to
be
construed
in
pari
materia,
i
think
you're
going
to
lose
on
that
point.
unknown
speaker
is
this
a
negotiated
plan?
unknown
speaker
well,
a
lot
of
plans
are
in
fact
the
result
of
collective
bargaining?
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
well,
any
state
law
of
general
applicability
regulates
insurance,
right?
unknown
speaker
if
we
apply
your
first
principle
of
presumption
against
preemption
then
i
guess
we
would
have
to
say
that
all
state
laws
of
general
applicability
continue
to
apply.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
they're
being
applied
to
insurance
companies.
unknown
speaker
what
about
the
mississippi
statute
of
frauds;
would
that
apply?
would
that
be
something
that
wasn't
pre-empted?
unknown
speaker
well,
what,
but
what
if
it
did?
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
it's
just
a
general
statute
of
frauds
that
doesn't
have
any
provision
in
it
about
insurance,
but
it
just
applies
to
all
written
contracts.
the
argument
is,
this
is
a
written
contract.
in
this
case,
it
regulates
an
insurance
company,
because
the
insurance
company
is
one
of
the
parties.
unknown
speaker
why?
i
don't
understand
why.
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
by
its
terms,
about
the
law,
by
its
terms
has
to
refer
to
plans?
unknown
speaker
what
if
mississippi
law
didn't
focus
particularly
on
an
insurance
company's
duty
to
pay,
but
just
say
that
any
debtor's
duty
to
pay,
you
could
have
a
breach
of
good
faith
and
recover
punitive
damages
for
the
failure
of
a
debt
to
pay
the,
debtor
to
pay
the
debt
on
time.
unknown
speaker
it
applies
to
them
more
often
than
anybody
else
probably
just
because
they
happen
to
pay
more
claims
than
anybody
else,
or
to
be
liable
to
pay
more
claims
than
anybody
else.
xxx
even
though
that
were
true,
by
terms
the
doctrine
applied
to
any
debtor.
unknown
speaker
where
do
you
get
that
limitation
out
of
the
statute,
that
it
has
to
relate
more
narrowly
to
insurance
companies?
unknown
speaker
sure,
but
a
general
state
law
saying
everybody
shall
pay
his
debts
applies
to
insurance
companies.
surely
that
regulates
insurance
companies.
unknown
speaker
it
regulates
them
and
everybody
else.
unknown
speaker
but,
you're
giving
it
a
narrower
interpretation
because
it
would
frankly
seem
somewhat
absurd
to
give
it
a
fuller--
unknown
speaker
--well,
then
your
general
principle
of
construe
everything
to
avoid
preemption,
i
would
have
thought
you
would
have
answered
the
chief
justice's
question
entirely
differently
saying,
yes,
it
covers
all
state
laws.
i
don't
know
how
else
your
principle
would
play
out
in
this
case.
or
otherwise
you're
not
being
loyal
to
your
principle
and,
you
know,
once
you
acknowledge
that
then
we
have
to
start
drawing
lines
and
i
don't
know
why
we
should
draw
the
line
where
you
want
us
to
between
somehow
applying
specially
to
insurance
companies
and
not
applying
specially.
why
we
should
draw
it
there
rather
than
between,
as
mccarran-ferguson
did,
between
statutory
regulation
and
non-statutory
regulation
or
some
other
fashion?
unknown
speaker
i
think
that's
a
more,
what
should
i
say,
consistent
position.
unknown
speaker
well,
it
might
have;
it
also
might
be
that
silence
may
run
the
other
way.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
might
have
expected
somebody
to
say
that
the
state
causes
of
action
are
preempted.
unknown
speaker
mr.
nolan,
where
do
you
draw
the
line
that
i
was
just
discussing
with
mr.
walker?
you
don't
draw
it
between
statute
and
non-statute.
how
do
we
know
when
its
a
law
regulating
insurance?
unknown
speaker
well,
then
the
insurance
company
doesn't
have
to
keep
a
certain
reserve?
unknown
speaker
no,
but
as
far
as,
as
far
as
his
erisa
function
is
concerned,
he's
insuring
under
erisa.
doesn't
he
have
to
comply
with
the
state
law
requiring
insurance
companies--
