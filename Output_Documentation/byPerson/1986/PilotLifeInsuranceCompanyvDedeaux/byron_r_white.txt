what
was
was
the
insurance
company's
fiduciary
duty
or
position
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sold
insurance,
it
sold
insurance
to
the
plan,
i
take
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
it
wasn't
a
trustee
of
the
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
is
the
named
fiduciary?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
under
erisa
how
do
you
get
at
a
claimed
breach
of
fiduciary
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
your
claim
is
denied,
why
you
can
contest
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
if
you
think
its
just
too
slow?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
the
insurance
company
under
this
plan,
or
under
the
statute
required
to
act
within
a
certain
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
and
what
is
the
civil
enforcement
proceeding
in
a
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
let's
assume
you
go
to
civil
enforcement
proceeding
and
you
win
and
the
insurance
company
has
breached
its
fiduciary
duty
to
act
in
time,
or
in
some
other
way.
then
what
happens?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
get
your
claim
paid.
justice
byron
r.
white
with
interest,
i
suppose.
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
you
get
no
remedy
against
the
trustee,
against
the
insurance
company.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
but
you
get
no
other
remedy.
you
just
make
pilot
life
do
what
it
should
have
done.
justice
byron
r.
white
plus
attorneys'
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
what
can,
what
else
can
you
get?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
can
you
get
any--
justice
byron
r.
white
--but
no
consequential
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
your
not
getting
your
money
on
time
has
caused
you
to
lose
some
money,
or
to
cost
you
some
money,
you
can't
have
any
remedy
for
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
can
you
get
any
money?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
can
you
get
any
money,
mr.
nolan?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what
form?
justice
byron
r.
white
but,
if
there's
a
cause
of
action
that's
applied
to
all
insurance
companies
in
the
state
that
says
that
bad
faith
or
refusal
to
honor
a
claim
is
remediable
by
some
damages
or
by
punitive
damages,
that
state
law
is
inapplicable
in
erisa
context?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever
been--
justice
byron
r.
white
--has
there
ever
been
a
case
where
they,
under
erisa...
and
it's
been
around
for
a
while
now...
where
some
insurance
company
has
had
to
pay
a
disappointed
claimant
some
money
on
review?
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
really
what
this
case
is
all
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
punitive
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
mr.
nolan,
why
isn't
it
a
regulation
of
insurance
if
there
is
a
state
law
that
says
insurance
companies
must
act
promptly
on
claims
and
if
they
don't
there's...
then
the
insureds
have
remedies?
now,
if
an
insurance
company
is
stuck
in
violation
of
that
law,
if
it
has
to
pay
some
money,
it
comes
out
of
its
pocket,
doesn't
it?
why
is
that
a
regulation
of
a
plan?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
that
may
be
so,
but
you
think
this,
why
should
a
state
be
preempted
from
providing
a
further
remedy
for
a
violation
of
a
federal
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
perhaps
you
could
say
he
has
to
exhaust
those
remedies
before
he
can
have
an
independent
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
it
would
also
raise
insurance
premiums
substantially.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
you
think
metropolitan
life
really
supports
you
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx...
state
law
that
said
that
insurance
companies
will
act
on
a
claim
within
a
week,
seven
days,
and
that
would
end.
the
state
said
this
includes
insurance
companies
who
insure
erisa
plans;
that
that
would
be
the
controlling
time
limit.
justice
byron
r.
white
despite
what
the
plan
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
no,
no.
justice
byron
r.
white
no.
on
the
state
says
the
insurance
company
shall
have
thirty
days
to
act
and
the
plan
says
fifteen
days.
the
state
law
would
control.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
yes,
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
it
wouldn't
make
a
bit
of
difference
what
the
plan
said
in
terms
of
the
time
or
the
procedure.
justice
byron
r.
white
and,
the
state
law
could
say,
if
you
don't
act
within
thirty
days,
you're
in
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't,
you
can
disregard
all
of
the
appellate
procedures
the
plan
might
provide?
