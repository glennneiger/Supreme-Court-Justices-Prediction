mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
issue
of
federal
preemption
of
state
common
law
claims
of
general
application
in
the
context
of
erisa.
the
real
significance
of
the
case
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
system
of
regulation
of
employee
benefit
plans,
as
governed
by
erisa,
will
now
be
largely
supplanted
by
the
varying
state
laws
that
congress
intended
erisa
to
replace.
congress
believed,
and
believes,
that
there
are
great
advantages
to
erisa,
that
those
advantages
admittedly
do
not
include
jury
trials,
punitive
damages,
consequential
damages,
de
novo
review
of
claims,
decisions
and
other
features
that
may
be
available
from
time
to
time
under
state
law.
if
such
state
remedies
are
available,
as
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
holds,
then
erisa
will
effectively
be
nullified
for
all
insured
plans.
now,
this
is
more
than
80
percent
of
the
health
benefit
plans
in
the
united
states,
the
vast
majority
of
them.
we
argue
that
congress
could
never
have
intended
this
result
and
expressly
provided
against
it
in
erisa.
the
focus
of
this
case
is
an
employee
benefit
plan
governed
by
erisa
in
its
claims
procedure
as
provided
in
section
503
of
erisa.
pilot
life,
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
is
the
named
fiduciary
for
that
plan
as
provided
in
erisa
and
as
designated
in
the
plan
itself,
and
pilot
life
has
full
responsibility
for
all
claims
decisions
and
claims
administration.
mr.
dedeaux,
the
respondent
here
is
a
participant
in
that
plan
and
his
claim
for
benefits
was
denied
by
pilot
life.
when
it
was
denied,
mr.
dedeaux
did
not
avail
himself
of
the
statutorily-mandated
claims
review
procedure
in
erisa,
in
section
503.
instead,
he
filed
suit
in
a
federal
district
court
in
mississippi,
diversity
jurisdiction.
he
claimed
tortious
breach
of
contract,
fraud,
and
breach
of
fiduciary
relationship.
he
sought
disability
benefits,
consequential
damages
for
mental
and
emotional
distress
in
the
amount
of
$250,000,
and
punitive
damages
in
the
amount
of
$500,000.
there
was
a
demand
of
jury
trial,
no
mention
of
erisa
in
the
case.
the
district
court
granted
summary
judgment
for
defendant.
it
held
that
erisa
provided
the
exclusive
remedy.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
5th
circuit
reversed,
holding
that
mr.
dedeaux's
state
common
law
claims
of
general
application
were
preserved
by
the
so-called
insurance
saving
clause
of
erisa
which
keeps
from
preemption
the
state
laws
that
regulate
insurance.
now
we
say
that
that
decision
is
wrong.
the
congress
in
enacting
erisa
sought
to
preempt
all
of
the
state
law
that
came
within
the
sphere
of
the
statute,
that
the
saving
clause
is
not
applicable
to
state
laws
like
this
because
they
don't
regulate
insurance
and
that,
in
any
event,
it
was
plain
that
congress
sought
to
prevent
the
direct
application
of
any
state
law
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
in
cases
like
this
which
involve
federal
preemption
of
state
law,
this
court
has
said,
as
it
did
most
recently
in
california
federal
v.
garrett,
decided
last
week,
that
its
sole
task
is
to
ascertain
the
intent
of
congress,
and
to
do
that
it
looks
at
the
language
and
the
legislative
history,
and
the
structure
and
purpose
of
the
statute.
the
key
language
here
is
found
in
section
514
of
erisa,
it's
entitled,
"effect
on
other
laws".
section
514(a),
is
a
sweeping,
express
provision
for
preemption.
it
says
that
erisa
supersedes
any
and
all
state
laws
that
may
now,
or
hereafter,
relate
to
any
employee
benefit
plans.
it's
followed
in
514(b),
by
the
so-called
saving
clause,
which
provides
that
nothing
in
erisa
shall
exempt
any
person
from
any
law
of
any
state
that
regulates
insurance.
and
that
clause
is
immediately
followed
and
modified
by
the
so-called
"deemer
clause"
which
provides
that
no
employee
benefit
plan
shall
be
deemed
to
be
an
insurance
company
or
engaged
in
insurance
for
purposes
of
any
state
law
purporting
to
regulate
insurance.
now
there
are
two
things
to
notice
about
the
language
in
514.
the
first
is
that
when
congress
uses
the
term,
"state
law
that
regulates
insurance",
it
is
using
a
term
of
art
and
in
this
instance
one
that
has
acquired
very
specific
meaning
through
years
of
interpretation
under
the
mccarran-ferguson
act.
the
second
is
that
congress
very
plainly
showed
its
purpose
to
prevent
any
direct
regulation
of
employee
benefit
plans
by
state
laws.
that
was
the
finding
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
metropolitan
life
v.
massachusetts,
decided
a
couple
of
years
ago,
where
the
court
said
that
the
purpose
of
the
deemer
clause
is
to
take
out
of
the
operation
of
the
saving
clause
any
state
laws
that
apply
directly
to
an
employee
benefit
plan.
these
state
common
law
claims
not
only
apply
directly
to
the
employee
benefit
plan,
but
they
clash
directly
with
the
key
provision
of
erisa
with
the
provisions
dealing
with
fiduciary
responsibility,
claims
review,
civil
enforcement
remedies.
these
are
the
core
functions
of
erisa.
they
go
to
the
very
heart
of
erisa
regulation
and
that's
why
congress
provided
that
they
couldn't
be
regulated
by
state
law.
the
legislative
history
of
erisa
plainly
confirms
the
intent
of
congress,
that
the
fiduciary
standards
of
erisa,
govern
the
entire
claims
administration
process.
that
was
the
finding
of
this
court
in
mass.
mutual
v.
russell,
decided
also
a
couple
of
years
ago.
it's
in
the
opinion
of
the
court
and
it's
very
expressly
in
justice
brennan's
concurring
opinion
as
well.
congress
intended
that
erisa
provide
a
uniform
source
of
law
for
evaluating
fiduciary
standards,
that
that
law
would
apply
all
over
the
united
states,
and
that
it
would
provide
standards
for
fiduciary
and
that
the
federal
courts
would
be
used
exclusively
for
cases
of--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--in
this
case,
justice
white,
the
insurance
company
had
the
responsibility
for
claims
administration.
it
also
had
the
insurance
policy
on...
it
funded
the
plan.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
it
sold
insurance
to
entex
and--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--it
was
acting
for
the
trustee
and
that's
really
the
key
to
the
case.
it
was
performing
the
erisa
function
that
otherwise
would
have
been
provided
by
the
trustee
of
the
plan.
it
was
acting
in
place
of,
and
standing
in
the
shoes
of
the
trustee.
it
is
the
named
fiduciary
under
erisa
and
it
was
provided--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--it
is
the
named
fiduciary
under
erisa.
to
it
was
delegated
the
authority
to
make
the
decisions
involved
in
claims
administration;
to
confirm
or
deny
claims
submitted
to
it.
that's
the
discretion
and
that's
the
function
of
the
named
fiduciary.
so,
it's
playing
the
key
role.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
at
erisa...
under
erisa
you,
if
you
have
a
case
like
this,
first
you
go
to
the
claims
review
procedure
provided
in
503.
when
you
finish
that
you
go
to
502
which
provides
what
this
court
has
referred
to
before
as
the
six
very
carefully--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--if
your
claims
is
denied,
you
can
contest
it
through
the
procedures
provided
expressly
in
the
statute.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
we...
our
position
is
that
this
is
the
law
that
congress
provided.
i
suppose
that
from
time
to
time--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--yes,
it
is.
and
if
the
claims
review
procedure,
for
example,
is
required
to
be
finished
in
sixty
days
and
then
there
may
be
an
additional
sixty
days.
if
there
has
not
been
action
at
the
end
of
that
time
then
the
claim
is
deemed
to
be
denied
under
regulations
provided
by
the
department
of
labor,
and
then
you
go
into
the
civil
enforcement
proceedings.
it's
a
very
carefully--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--the
civil
enforcement
proceeding
is
in
a
court,
yes.
state
or
federal
court;
for
some
types
of
actions
only
federal
court.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
then
you
get
whatever--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--you
get
your
claim
paid.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
possibly.
you
get
attorney's
fees,
you
get
other
types
of
equitable
relief.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
in
this
instance,
justice
white,
the
insurance
company,
pilot
life,
is
in
effect
the
trustee.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
it
is
correct.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
it
is
correct
that
you
make
pilot
life
do
what
it
should
have
done.
you
are
not
necessarily
limited
to
that
remedy.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well
you
can
get
all
of
the
civil
enforcement
rights
provided
in
section
502.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
you
can
recover
benefits
under
the
plan.
you
can
enforce,
or
clarify
your
rights.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
no
consequential
damages.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
you
can
sue
to
obtain
equitable
relief
specifically
under
the
statute.
you
can
sue
to
enjoin
the
fiduciary.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
you
can
have
the
fiduciary
removed.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
yes,
you
can
get
money.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
in
whatever
form
the
court
to
which
the
application
for
equitable
relief
is
made
finds
appropriate.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
i
said
that
you
could
get
money
in
the
context
of
seeking
to
obtain
equitable
relief
from
the
court.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
you
can
enjoin
the
trustee,
you
can
remove
the
trustee.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
i
did
not
say
damages,
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
meant
that
an
application
for
equitable
relief
to
the
court,
pursuant
to
the
specific
provisions
of
section
502,
can
take
whatever
form
the
court,
in
that
instance,
might
find
appropriate.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
there
have
been
a
variety
of--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--well,
i
think
that,
generally
speaking,
punitive
and
consequential
damages
have
not
been
allowed
in
erisa
cases
by
this
court
or,
by
and
large,
by
other
courts.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that
is
what
this
case
is
all
about.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that's
correct.
the
court
on
equity
never
does.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
think
that's
right
and
i
think
that's
the
key
distinction
between
state
law
and
federal
law
here.
this
was
to
be
achieved
by
section
514,
the
effect
on
other
laws
provision,
the
preemption
of
state
law
to
allow
the
federal
system
to
control
employee
benefit
plan
regulations.
that
section
is
referred
to--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--well,
i
don't
know--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--i
don't
know
of
a
general
equitable
power
to
give
money.
i
know
that...
i
know
that
this
court
in
mass.
mutual
v.
russell,
the
case
that
was
before
it
two
years
ago,
reserved
its
judgment
about
anything
more
than
the
specific
sections
that
were
involved
in
that
case.
and,
that
was
the
thrust
of
the
concurring
opinion.
i
know
that--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--i
argued
that
case,
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
it,
i
know
also
that
the,
that
the
law
provides
for
equitable
relief
and
i
just
can't
presume
to
say
that
that
could
never
include
the
concept
of
making
someone
whole.
i
think
it
very
plainly
did
not
include
damages.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that
is
correct.
but,
there
is
equitable
relief
under
section
502.
and
i
don't
know
what
form
that
would
take.
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
it
would
not
take
the
form
of
damages,
punitive
or
consequential.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
in,
where
a
plan
exists,
as
it
does
in
this
case,
the
claims
administration
is
provided
by
the
named
fiduciary.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
this
court
has
recognized
that
that
whole
function
is
controlled,
governed
by
federal
law
under
erisa
and
the
fiduciary
standards
of
that
law
are
applicable.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
i
guess
the...
i
guess
the
clearest
answer
to
that,
justice
white,
is
shown
by
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
i
believe
that
it
is
accurate
to
say,
beyond
question,
that
if
punitive
damages
are
available
under
state
remedies,
no
participant,
no
beneficiary,
not
mr.
dedeaux
nor
anyone
else,
will
utilize
the
provisions
of
section
503
of
erisa
which
provides
for
claims
review.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
you
could,
but
his
remedies
there
i
guess
would
be
viewed
as
never
adequate
if
he
had
a
shot
at
punitive
damages
in
a
state
court.
it
isn't
just
that
mr.
dedeaux
did
this.
i
think
it
unmistakably
clear
that
every
litigant
similarly
situated
would
do
it.
if
that
happens,
that
reduces
503
to
a
dead
letter.
it
repeals
it
in
effect.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
i
think
that,
i
think
that
in
erisa
congress
had
that
concern,
justice
white.
i
think
that
it
was...
these
plans
are
voluntary,
nobody
has
to
set
them
up.
this
is
a
law
to
provide
for
a
voluntary
system
that
companies
will
take
on
individually.
so
it
was
intended
to
be
run
efficiently
and
effectively,
and
at
low
cost.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
it
requires
that
there
be
a
trustee.
the
trustee
does
not
have
to
be
independent.
entex
could
have
done
it.
entex
is
the
plan's
sponsor
and
administrator,
but
has
delegated
to
pilot
life
this
key
fiduciary
role.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
think
that
it
varies
quite
a
bit.
generally
speaking,
i
think
that
larger
companies
do
more
of
it
themselves.
i
think
that
the
insurance
companies
are
most
important
for
medium-sized
and
small
companies
where
the
kind
of
catastrophic
losses
that
may
be
available
in
the
plan
would
be
too
much
for
their
resources.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that's
correct.
and
there
isn't.
there
are
a
myriad
of
variations.
in
other
words,
there
are
insurance
companies
that
only
insure,
they
fund
the
plan;
but
an
independent
agency,
another
insurance
company,
a
claims
administrator,
the
plan
sponsor,
someone
else
administers
the
claim
and
makes
the
claims
decisions.
there
are
other
cases
where
the
insurance
company
takes
on
all
of
the
administration,
including
all
of
the
claims
part
of
it,
but
does
not
fund
the
plan.
and
so
there
are
all
of
these
varieties.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
that's
the...
that
is
actually
the
key
question,
justice
scalia,
and
i
think
that
the
clearest,
most
concise
statement
of
that
is
found
in
a
report
of
the
house
labor
committee,
it's
dated
january,
1977.
it
was
referred
to
and
relied
on
by
this
court
in
the
metropolitan
life
case
and
it
goes
directly
to
that
point
and
the
report
says
on
the
one
hand
it
was
clear
that
the
plans
subject
to
erisa
needed
to
be
freed
of
the
possibility
of
state
regulation.
on
the
other,
it
was
important
to
limit
the
effect
of
pre-emption
in
order
to
avoid
disrupting
state
efforts
to
regulate
the
conduct
of
other
financial
entities
not
subject
to
the
federal
act.
so,
i
think
that
that
really
says
it
about
as
clearly
as
it
can
be
said.
congress--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--excuse
me?
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
guess
it
could
have
been--
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
i
think
you're
right,
justice,
that
it
could
have
been
done
either
way
and
perhaps
the
reason
that
it
was
done
this
way
in
this
instance
is
the
mccarran-ferguson
act
and
the
tradition
of
insurance
regulations
that
follows
from
it
and
congress's
awareness
of
that.
but,
as
far
as
the
purpose
of
congress
is
concerned
there
isn't
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
paragraph
that
i
just
read
from
the
report.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
i
guess
the...
i'm
not
sure
metropolitan
life
satisfied,
satisfies
that,
but
i
think
it
probably
comes
pretty
close
to
it.
any
of,
any
of
those...
metropolitan
life
was
a
case
that
involved
a
mandated
benefits
law
of
the
state
of
massachusetts
and
it's
exemplary,
i
think,
of
the
principle,
what
we're
talking
about
here.
anything
that
the
state
says,
you
have
to
put
that
in
your
policy,
all
of
the
regulation
of
insurance
companies.
i've
read
several
law
review
articles
in
this
subject
in
the
course
of
preparing
for
this
case,
and
the
emphasis
on
insurance
regulation
is
a
thousand
different
regulatory
features
having
to
do
with
financial
soundness
and
licensing
and
the
selling
of
insurance
and
what
the
content
of
the
policy
is,
and
so
on.
you
don't
get
to
a
question
like
this
until
you
get
into
the
operation
of
erisa,
in
this
instance
until
you
get
into
the
claims
approval
procedure.
so,
all
of
those
cases
in
point
of
time
back
of
where
we
are
would
be
regulated
by
state
insurance
law.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
just
a
few
points,
if
the
court
please.
first,
to
respond
to
the
chief
justice's
comment
about
what
did
congress
contemplate,
i
think
that's
very
important.
i
think
that's
really
what
we're
doing
here.
what
congress
contemplated
is
repeated
over
and
over
and
over
again
in
the
legislative
history.
they
contemplated
a
uniform
system
of
federal
regulation
of
employee
benefit
plans.
there
is
by
stark
contrast
not
a
single
reference
anyplace
in
the
legislative
history
to
preservation
of
any
kind
of
a
state
cause
of
action
like
this.
that's
very
significant.
the
legislative
history
of
erisa
runs
15
volumes.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
i
think
the
silence,
justice
white,
runs
toward
the
uniformity
that
you
commented
on
earlier
and
that's
what
congress
was
thinking
of.
it's
inconceivable
that
congress,
in
a
legislative
history
that
extensive,
could
make
a
major
exception
to
what
it
was
providing
in
the
statute
and
make
no
reference
to
it.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
well,
there
are
references
to
state
causes
of
action
in
a
lot
of
other
statutes
as
you
know,
justice
white,
from
the
silkwood
case,
as
this
court
knows,
from
title
vii
and
so
on.
there
are
a
lot
of
different
ways
to
do
it,
but
none
of
those
ways
took
place
here.
the
definition
of
the
employee
benefit
plan
very
specifically
includes
plans
funded
through
the
purchase
of
insurance
or
otherwise.
that's
definitional
in
the
statute.
it
isn't
that
congress
provided
one
statute
for
insured
plans
and
another
for
self-insured
plans.
employee
benefit
plans
are
defined
as
plans
that
provide
benefits
through
the
purchase
of
insurance
or
otherwise.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
we
would
draw
the
line,
justice
scalia,
on
the
function
and
we
think
what
function
is
the
actor,
insurance
company
in
this
instance,
performing?
if
it
is
performing
a
compulsorily,
an
erisa-mandated
function,
in
this
instance
claims
administration,
we
would
say
that
that
was
erisa
and
preemption
applied.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
all
of
that
is
regulated
by
state
law.
that
doesn't
really
rise
to
the
level
of
an
erisa.
mr.
john
e.
nolan,
jr.
he
does.
insurance
companies
for
all
of
those
kinds
of
considerations
comply
with
state
law.
you
don't
get
to
an
issue
like
this
until
you
get
into
the
administration
of
an
employee
benefit
plan.
and
this
function
reaches
into
the
very
vitals
of
that
administration.
