mr.
nolan,
what
was
the
insurance
exception
meant
to
cover?
i
mean,
you
painted
for
us
this
picture
of
pristeen
uniformity,
but
we
have
in
the
statute
an
exception
that
seems
to
indicate
that
there
are
some
instances
where
the
uniformity
will
be
disrupted
or
otherwise
you
wouldn't
need
the
exception.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
the
exception
cover
where
without
it
you'd
get
a
different
result?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
need
an
exception
for
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
you
need
an
exception
for
that?
i
mean,
what
kind
of
thing
that
arguably
would
have
been
covered
by
the
statute
has
been
excepted
from
it
by
this
provision,
or
is
it
just
a,
you
know,
better
make
doubly
sure
kind
of
an
exception?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
tend
to
think
exceptions
are
in
there
because
without
them
something
different
would
happen.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
different
would
happen
if
this
exception
weren't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
all
i'm
asking
for
is
an
example
of
a
case
that
would
come
out
differently
had
the
exception
not
been
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
from
the
law
of
the
state
actually,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
walker,
if
what
you
say
is
true,
if
that
interpretation
is
correct,
there
is
a
severe
disadvantage
in
having
an
insurance
company
act
as
trustee
under
the
plan.
right?
i
mean,--
justice
antonin
scalia
--an
enormous
disadvantage.
is
there
any
indication
in
the
legislative
history
or
any
reason
why
congress
would
have
wanted
to
create
that
disadvantage?
