h.
rehnquist
mr.
nolan,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nolan,
you
said
that
in
the
equitable
side
of
the
thing
you
could
get
money.
did
i
understand
that
correctly?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
be
more
specific.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
you
can
get
the
amount
of
the
claim
plus
attorney's
fees
on
the
law's
side
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
say
you
could
remove
the
trustee
in
equity.
what
sort
of--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
now
i
want
to
know,
because
i
thought
you
said
that
the
equity
side
could
award
you
some
sort
of
money
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
did
you
mean?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
certainly
a
court
on
equity
never
awards
punitive
damages.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
there
is
no
prospect
of
recovery
of
punitive
damages
if
the
state
law
is
preempted?
isn't
that
correct?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
erisa,
mr.
nolan,
require
that
there
be
an
independent
trustee
of
some
sort
to
administer
the
plan?
entex
in
this
case
couldn't
do
it
itself?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
any,
do
you
have
any
way
of
knowing
what
percentage
of
the
administrators
of
erisa
plans
are
insurance
companies?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
suppose
if
an
employer
were
a
self-insurer
there
would
be
no
question
of
the
plan
coming
under
the
insurance
savings
clause.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
nolan.
now
we'll
hear
from
you,
mr.
walker.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
walker.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
nolan,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nolan.
the
case
is
submitted.
