justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
nolan,
i
really
was
puzzled,
as
the
chief
justice
was,
about
your
notion
of
some
other
money.
maybe
there
isn't
all
as
much
difference
between
the
federal
scheme
and
the
state
scheme,
if
there's
some
general
equitable
power
to
give
money.
i
don't
know
about
that
myself.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
section
are
you
referring
to
when
you
say
that?
