well,
what
could
it
be
other
than
restitution?
i
just
think
this
argument
strikes
me
as
very
strange
and
almost
misleading.
i
understood
that
if
the
federal
law
preempts
then
there
are
no
consequential
damages
available.
there
are
no
punitive
damages
available.
there's
no
jury
trial
available
and
so
on.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
nolan,
don't
you
think
we'd
have
to
cut
back
a
bit
on
some
of
the
language
in
that
metropolitan
life
case
for
you
to
prevail
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
walker,
i
think
that
we
have
to
focus
on
the
deemer
clause,
because
whatever
is
covered
by
the
deemer
clause
is
removed
from
the
savings
clause,
if
you
will,
that
you're
relying
on.
so,
we
have
to
know
whether
the
deemer
clause
extends
to
a
trust
established
under
a
plan,
whether
or
not
the
trustee
is
the
insurance
company
that
happens
to
be
serving
to
insure
that
erisa
plan.
and
if
anything
at
all
seems
clear
from
the
history,
the
congressional
and
legislative
history,
of
erisa,
it
would
seem
to
be
that
remedies
provided
for
employees
covered
by
an
erisa
plan,
whether
insured
or
not,
are
limited
to
those
spelled
out
in
the
legislation.
and
so
i
think
there
a
very
logical
argument
can
be
made
and
is
being
made
that
the
deemer
clause
backs
out
of
the
savings
clause
at
least
the
remedies
provided
for
an
insured
employee.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
says,
"for
purposes
of
any
law
of
any
state
purporting
to
regulate
insurance
companies.
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's
why
i
asked
mr.
nolan
if
he
didn't
think
you
had
to
cut
back
on
some
of
the
language
in
that
russell
case.
he
thought
not,
but
i
think
there's
some
difficulties.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
really
think
that
congress
intended
to
allow
the
very
detailed
civil
enforcement
procedures
for
an
employee
covered
by
an
erisa
plan
to
be
completely
bypassed
at
the
plaintiff's
option?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but,
it
may
have
backed
out
of
that
in
the
deemer
clause,
that's
the
problem.
