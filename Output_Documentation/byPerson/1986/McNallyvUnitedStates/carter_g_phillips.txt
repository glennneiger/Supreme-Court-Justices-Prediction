mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
--this
case
involves
the
proper
interpretation
of
18
u.s.c.
section
1341,
the
federal
mail
fraud
statute.
the
primary
issue
presented
is
whether
it
is
fraud
within
the
meaning
of
that
statute
for
a
political
party
leader
to
fail
to
disclose
to
state
officials
a
potential
conflict
of
interest
in
his
handling
of
the
state's
patronage
system.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
a
conviction
under
this
so-called
intangible
rights
theory
is
proper
and
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse.
the
basic
facts
were
as
follows:
the
petitioners
and
the
third
individual,
howard
hunt,
were
politically
active
in
the
democratic
party,
in
the
state
of
kentucky,
during
the
1970s.
in
part
because
of
their
hard
work
on
behalf
of
governor
carroll,
who
was
elected
in
1974,
petitioner
gray
was
appointed
to
a
cabinet
position
in
1976
and
mr.
hunt
was
named
head
of
the
democratic
party.
hunt
as
the
head
of
the
democratic
party
was
invested
with
substantial
patronage
powers
by
the
governor,
which
is
not
an
uncommon
practice,
i
think,
in
any
state.
what
may
be
somewhat
less
common
is
the
decades
long
tradition
in
kentucky
that
certain
state
insurance
commissions
are
treated
as
part
of
the
patronage
system.
thus,
the
agent
for
the
state
in
procuring
insurance
was
asked
to
share
commissions
with
other
individuals
holding
insurance
licenses.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
don't
know
that
it
is
worse
than
ordinary
party
patronage.
i
think
it's
just
somewhat
less
common
than
any
other
party
patronage.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
as
far
as
the
government's
concerned.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
i
think
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
suspect
the
government
would
say
so.
yes,
your
honor.
those
receiving
shared
commissions
were
not
required
to
perform
any
services
or
to
be
engaged
in
the
insurance
business
at
the
time
that
they
received
those
commissions.
all
that
was
required
was
that
a
licensed
agent
be
available.
and
it
was
not
uncommon
frankly
for
relatives
of
public
officials
to
receive
some
of
those
commissions.
for
instance,
the
state
insurance
commission--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
absolutely
not
a
violation
of
state
law
to
receive
commissions
for
doing
no
work.
there
is
no
obligation
that
you
do
any
work.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
state
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
at
the
time
that
all
the
commissions
were
received,
the
individuals
receiving
them
were
licensed
agents,
or
had
a
licensed
agent
affiliated
with
the
company
involved,
or
the
recipient
of
the
commission.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
i
would
say
two
things
about
that,
justice
o'connor.
first,
that's
correct.
no
state
law
was
violated.
two,
even
if
state
law
had
been
violated
there
was
no
instruction
to
the
jury
asking
the
jury
to
find
that
state
law
had
been
violated.
so
that
it's
not,
you
know,
whether
there
was
a
violation
of
state
law
in
this
case
is
simply
not
relevant
to
what
the
jury
decided.
as
i
was
suggesting.
it
was
not
uncommon
for
public
officials,
or
the
relatives
of
public
officials
themselves
to
receive
shared
commissions
under
the
patronage
scheme.
the
insurance
commissioner
himself
testified
that
his
son
was
receiving
insurance
commissions
as
a
part
of
this
practice.
he
knew
about
it
and
never
doubted
that
it
was
a
lawful
practice.
in
this
case
the
government
has
however,
challenged
mr.
hunt's
recommendation
to
the
insurance
commissioner
to
appoint
the
wombwell
insurance
agency
as
the
agent
of
the
state
for
worker's
compensation
and
his
directions
as
to
how
to
share
those
commissions.
because
the
government
in
its
brief,
in
this
court
on
the
merits,
has
for
the
first
time
suggested
that
this
case
is
not
really
an
intangible
rights
case,
i
think
that
it
is
terribly
important
that
the
court
understand
clearly,
precisely
how
the
case
was
submitted
to
the
jury.
the
government
has
reproduced
the
relevant
instructions
in
its
brief
at
pages
nine
to
ten
and
footnote
eight.
in
reading
them
as
a
whole,
i
submit,
reveals
quite
clearly
that
the
district
court
told
the
jury,
at
the
government's
request
that
it
could
conclude
that
petitioners
"devised
such
a
scheme",
describing
the
scheme
in
the
indictment
as
read
in
relevant
portion
to
the
jury,
if
the
jury
found
five
facts
basically.
one,
that
there
was
control
over
the
naming
of
an
insurance
agency
by
mr.
hunt.
two,
that
mr.
hunt
had
something
to
do
with
the
selection
of
wombwell.
three,
that
he
directed
wombwell
to
share
those
commissions
in
a
particular
way,
four,
that
he
held
an
ownership
interest
in
seton
investments.
and
five,
that
he
failed
to
disclose
debt
interest
to
the
state
government.
with
respect
to
the
petitioners
then,
they
are
charged
solely
with
aiding
and
abetting
that
basic
claim.
our
position
is
that
however
you
analyze
those
facts
as
required
to
be
found
by
the
jury,
there
is
no
fraud
in
this
case.
and
that
the
jury
was
clearly
instructed
that
it
could
find
on
that
theory
as
an
alternative
basis
for
holding
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
has
been
violated
and
that
the
jury,
and
therefore
the
government
must
justify
its
extension
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
to
the
situation
involving
hunt.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
first
part,
the
government
is
clearly,
i
mean,
the
government
is
clearly
making
that
argument
and
there
is
a
statement
in
re-reading--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
the
indictment
was
read
to
the
jury
and
that
is
in
the
indictment.
but
if
you
read
the
paragraphs
before
the
indictment
and
the
paragraphs
after
the
indictment,
the
reliance
on
obtaining
money
or
property
by
false
pretenses
is
irrelevant.
it
is
a
scheme
to
defraud
as
described
at
the
beginning.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
couldn't
say
it
better
myself.
because
the
government
in
it's
brief
on
the
merits
in
this
court
has
taken,
excuse
me,
to
the
place
the
government's
theory
then
into
perspective,
the
court
must
realize,
one,
the
jury
was
not
asked
to
find
that
the
state
of
kentucky
or
any
of
its
citizens
lost
any
money
as
a
consequence
of
this
scheme.
and
two,
the
jury
was
not
asked
to
find
that
hunt,
gray,
or
mcnally
frankly
received
one
cent
from
the
patronage
arrangement.
the
theory
is
merely
one
of
non-disclosure.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that's
absolutely
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
commissions,
the
size
of
the
commissions
were
outside
of
the
state's
control.
that
money
went
to
wombwell.
so
that
the
government's
repeated
reference
to
this
as
a
matter
of
public
funds,
simply
inaccurate.
they
were
not
public
funds.
they
were
wombwell's
funds
and
wombwell
willingly
parted
with
them.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it
is
paid
by
the
underwriter.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
it's
a
commission
paid
back
by
the
underwriter.
but
the
amount
of
money
that
kentucky
had
to
pay
to--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--have
insurance
was
set.
it
couldn't
be
modified
in
any
way.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
there
were
two
underwriters
and
they're
just
large
insurance
companies.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
xxx.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
it's
just
the
method
of
recompense
for
the
activities
of
the
agent
and
so--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
absolutely.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
that
is
precisely
our
position,
mr.
chief
justice.
as
far
as
we're
concerned
the
term--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--might
of
been
willing
to
charge
less.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
except
that
there's--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no
evidence
to
that
effect
in
the
record
in
this
case.
and
no
effort
by
the
government
to
try
to
prove
that--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
mean,
my
guess
is
that
wombwell
would
prefer
to
share
it
with
other
insurance
agents
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
develop
good
will.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
yes,
it
was
a
patronage
device.
it
was
to
generate
good
will
both
with
the
state
of
kentucky
and
with
other
insurance
agencies.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no
one
ever
suggested
that
anything
could
be
granted
back
to
the
state.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
that
would
be
sort
of
anti-patronage,
i
suppose.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
in
light
of
the
jury
instructions
in
this
case,
it
seems
to
us
quite
remarkable
that
the
government
has
all,
i
think,
but
conceded
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
as
applied
to
a
political
party
leader
is
wholly
inapplicable.
it's
sole
defense
on
this
issue
in
the
brief
appears
in
a
single
paragraph
on
page
32.
and
the
government
tells
the
court,
quote,
it
is
at
least
clear
that
those
individuals,
referring
to
party
leaders
given
the
power
to
carry
on
the
state's
business,
have
a
duty
not
to
use
that
governmental
party
to
criminally
profit
themselves
or
their
friends.
the
problem
with
that
statement
and
it's
the
sole
defense
of
the
government's
case
here,
is
that
it
again
ignores
the
jury
instructions.
there
was
no
criminal
profit.
there
was
no
profit
at
all,
in
terms
of
what
the
jury
was
asked
to
find.
the
sole
theory
in
this
case
involves
a
matter
of
non-disclosure.
that's
what
the
jury
was
instructed
on
and
that's
what
the
jury
found.
the
fact
the
jury
found
that
however
is
unfortunate
for
the
government
because
this
is
not
mail
fraud.
it's
not
fraud
of
any
sort.
because
as
this
court
said
in
schiarella,
in
order
for
there
to
be
fraud,
there
must
be
a
duty
to
disclose
and
what
is
utterly
missing
in
anything,
in
either
the
government's
brief
or
anything
at
the
trial
in
this
case
is
any
indication
of
where
a
duty
to
disclose
exists
and
extends
to
a
political
party
leader.
and
because
of
that,
the
government's
case
necessarily
fails
as
a
matter
of
law.
mr.
gray
was
a
political
official,
but
as
the
jury--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--yes,
he
was
a
state
official.
but
as
the
jury
instruction
quite
clearly
specifies--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--he
was
found
guilty
under
the
government's
theory
of
aiding
and
abetting
hunt.
but,
not
as
a
government
official.
there's
nothing
in
the
instruction
with
respect
to
aiding
and
abetting
that
required
mr.
gray
to
be
a
government
official.
and
in
the
closing
arguments--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
believe
he
would
of
had
a
duty
to
disclose,
although
the
jury
wasn't
required
to
find
that
he
would.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
was
a
state
official.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
would
be
in
a
different
position
and
this
case
would
be
somewhat
different
if
the
jury
had
been
instructed
only
that
it
had
to
find
the
mr.
gray
had
violated
his
duties.
but
that
was
not
the
way
the
jury
was
instructed.
the
jury
was
instructed--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
mr.
gray
did
not
receive
any
money.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
the
government
attempted
to
prove
that
he
may
of
gained
some
benefit,
but
the
jury
was
not
asked
to
make
any
findings
as
to
whether
he
had
gained
any
benefit.
and
there
is
clearly
no
evidence
as
to
receipt
of
any
money.
whether
he
gained
a
benefit
is
unclear
but--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i
don't
believe
that
mr.
gray
violated
any
state
law
as
a
consequence
of
his
conduct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i'm
not
frankly
completely
familiar
with
bribery
laws
in
the
state
of
kentucky,
but
my
sense
is
that
those
benefits
are
so
far
removed
from
any
public
actions
that
mr.
gray
would
have
undertaken
that
i
doubt
seriously
there
would
have
been
a
violation
of
state
law.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
no,
no.
he
wasn't
the
insurance
commissioner.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
was
the
secretary
of
the
cabinet.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
i
hesitate
to
speak
on
it,
for
mr.
hunt,
but
i
think
the
answer
is
they
were
friends
and
i
don't
think
it
is
a
scheme,
frankly.
they
were
friends
and
they
happened
to
have
an
inter-relationship.
but
i
don't
know
that
from
our
perspective
and
given
that
the
jury
wasn't
required
to
make
any
findings,
i
hesitate
to
say
that
he
was
involved
in
that
particular
scheme.
but
i
think
the
important
point
to
remember,
justice
white,
is
that
the
jury
was
instructed
on
that
point
in
the
alternative
and
therefore,
whether
or
not,
and
i
don't
think
the
gray
theory
would
hold
water
either,
but
whether
or
not
it
would
is
irrelevant
to
this
case.
the
government
still
has
to
demonstrate
that
mr.
hunt
violated
the
law
in
the
ways
that
he
did
and
that
the
petitioners
aided
and
abetted
that
violation.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
mr.
hunt
was
the
head
of
the
democratic
party.
he
was
the
executive
chairman
of
the
democratic
party
of
the
state
of
kentucky.
never
held
public
office
within
the
state
of
kentucky.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
was
placed
in
charge
of
basic
patronage
recommendations.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
the
jury
instruction
didn't
ask
for
that.
all
the
jury
was
asked
to
find
was
that
he
had
control
over
those
decisions
and
so,
and
the
evidence
was
that
he
made
recommendations
and
those
recommendations
were
followed.
to
say
that
he
had
defacto
control
in
that
sense
strikes
me
as
not
any
different
than
any
other
party
leader
making
recommendations
to
his
own
party
leaders
who
happened
to
hold
public
offices.
so,
in
a
sense
sure,
he
had
defacto
control,
but
our
position
is
that
jury
instruction
is
so
far
removed
from
anything
that
would
make
him
a
public
official,
that
there
is
simply
no
basis
for
creating
a
duty,
certainly
if
the
government
has
cited
nothing--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--on
the
basis
for
creating
that
duty.
and
that
is
a
federally
created
duty.
it
does
not
exist
in
state
law.
and,--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
on
that
issue,
just
on
that
one
issue
as
to
whether
they're
might
be
a
state
law
duty
to
disclose
the
issue
would
be
different.
on
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
there's
any
pecuniary
gain,
and
whether
pecuniary
gain
is
a
necessary
requirement
of
the
mail
fraud
statute,
i'd
say
that's
a
separate
and
open
issue.
i
think
we
would
also
have
made
some
additional
arguments
if
this
case
turned
on
mr.
gray's
status
in
terms
of
when
does
a
duty
trigger.
it
is
one
thing
to
say
that
public
officials
have
some
duties
to
disclose,
but
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
every,
that
you
know,
in
this
case
the
government
says,
mr.
gray
had
a
duty
to
disclose
basically
because
he
saw
some
wrong
doing
going
on.
not
that
he
necessarily
benefitted
from
it.
so,
it's
not
at
all
clear
to
me
that
he
would
of
had
a
duty
to
disclose
in
this
case.
but
again,
we
run
far
afield
from
anything
the
jury
was
asked
to
decide
in
this
particular
case.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
this
court's
decisions
in
both
fasulo
and
hammerschmidt
state
that
what
is
involved
with
respect
to
fraud
is
injury
and
injury
defined
in
terms
of
property.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
okay.
oh
no,
that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
mean
to
imply
that.
throughout
our
brief
we
argue
that
what's
missing
here
is
any
injury,
any
economic
injury
to
the
victim
of
a
fraud,
which
is
the
state
of
kentucky,
and
what
is
also
missing
is
any
pecuniary
gain
to
the
defendants.
but
that
was
only
in
response
to
justice
stevens'
question.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
you
know,
our
position
remains
that
injury
to
money
or
property
is
a
condition
required
for
mail
fraud.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
well,
no
decisions--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
none
of
those
decisions
were
by
this
court
and
the
government
freely
concedes
that
this
court
has
never
decided
the
validity
of
the
intangible
rights
theory.
and
as
we
indicate--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--i'm
sorry?
justice
stevens,
i'm--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
i
think
the
evidence
is
slightly
different
in
that
case
because
there
really
was
bribery
and--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--and
closeness,
the
nexus
in
terms
of
the
duty
and
the
creation
of
duty--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--no,
on
that
issue
it's
the
same.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
but,--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--well,
there
was
more
to
kerner
actually
than
simply
a
duty
to
disclose.
there
were
intangible
rights
underlying
it
and
that's
certainly
a
part
of
that
case.
there
was
also,
you
know,
a
certain
amount
of--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--just
on
the
mail
fraud.
but,
you
know,
as
we
suggested
in
our
reply
brief,
that
wasn't
all
he
was
convicted
of.
so
that
even
if
the
court
had
taken
up
the
mail
fraud
issue,
would
not
have
required
reversal
of
all
the
convictions
against
him.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
which
i
think--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--right.
yes,
i
understood
that
to
be
justice
stevens
point.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
sure,
he
was
clearly
a
public
official.
nobody
disputes
that.
and,
none
of
the
petitioners
are,
i
mean,
hunt
does
not.
in
sum,
the
government
today
asks
this
court
to
sign
what
is
basically
a
prosecutorial
blank
check
to
rid
the
mails
of
any
political
act
that
a
united
states
attorney
finds
unacceptable.
what
makes
this
request
most
dangerous
we
think,
is
the
fact
that
even
an
indictment
in
the
context
of
political
officials
or
public,
or
it's
going
to
be
party
leaders,
can
be
devastating
to
their
public
careers.
and
thus,
the
government
is
asking
this
court
not
only
to
sign
a
blank
check,
but
a
check
that
is
of
enormous
consequence.
this
court
cannot
sign
that
check.
only
congress
can
because
only
congress
can
declare
conduct
to
be
illegal.
and
congress
has
not
declared
anything
that
the
petitioners
have
done
in
this
case,
as
presented
to
the
jury,
to
be
against
the
law.
now,
what
the
government--
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
--the
petitioners
are
mcnally
and
gray,
yes,
justice
white.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
gray's
offense,
under
the
instructions
to
the
jury
was
aiding
and
abetting
hunt.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
he
was
charged
in
the
alternative
as
a
principal.
the
instruction
is
quite
clear
at
footnote
a,
the
district
court's
instruction
to
the
jury
says,
in
order
to
find
this
scheme,
you
must
find
one
of
the
following:
either
that
hunt
engaged
in
certain
activities
and
was
aided
and
abetted
by
the
two
petitioners,
or
that
mr.
gray
engaged
in
certain
activities
and
was
aided
and
abetted
by
petitioner
mcnally.
it
is
clearly
in
the
alternative
and
therefore,
the
government
is
obliged
to
justify
both
of
those
theories.
with
respect,
unless
there
are
further
questions
on
the
mail
fraud
count,
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy
issue
and
the
failure
of
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider
petitioner's
contention
that
the
government
failed
to
prove
the
tax
object
of
the
conspiracy,
we
explained
in
both
our
opening
brief
and
our
reply
brief,
why
the
government's
request
for
a
rule
of
per
se
harmless
error
seems
to
us
unwarranted.
in
light
of
the
government's
concession;
however,
that
if
it
loses
on
the
mail
fraud
issue
that
the
conspiracy
count
must
necessarily
be
reversed.
i
would
rest
on
the
briefs
unless
the
court
has
questions
and
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
carter
g.
phillips
thank
you
mr.
chief
justice.
i
would
like
to
make
simply
three
points.
i
hate
to
drag
you
back
into
the
jury
instructions,
but
i
think
they're
fairly
important
in
this
context.
the
first
statement
that
mr.
ayer
made
with
respect
to
the
instruction,
i
think,
requires
some
clarification
was
his
suggestion
that
mr.
gray
and
his
aiding
and
abetting
must
have
been
a
public
official,
that
the
jury
must
have
found
that.
aside
from
the
point
that
i
believe
justice
stevens
made,
which
is
that
there
was
no
requirement
in
the
jury
instruction
that
that
be
found.
the
truth
is
that
at
the
closing
argument,
the
united
states
attorneys,
the
assistant
u.s.
attorney
told
the
jury
that
the
aiding
and
abetting
was
in
setting
up
seton.
and
it
is
undisputed
that
when
seton
was
set
up
by
mr.
gray
he
was
not
a
public
official.
so,
it's
both
contrary
to
the
instruction
and
contrary
to
the
facts
of
the
case.
second,
with
the
respect
to
the
false
pretenses,
i
guess
i
would
just
like
to
repeat
what
justice
stevens
said,
this
whole
notion
of
a
phony
business
and
the
various
ways
that
that
may
have
operated
is
an
interesting
theory.
it
is
not
the
theory
that
was
presented
to
the
jury
in
this
case
and
i
take
that
as
the
best
evidence
that
the
reference
to
false
pretenses
was
not
regarded
as
somehow
a
separate
item
in
this
case
at
all,
either
to
the
court,
or
to
the
jury.
and
the
court
made
it
quite
clear
what
it
thought
the
appropriate
theory
for
conviction
was
in
this
case.
and
that
set
out
in
the
portion
that
describes
the
scheme
underwritten
in
the
indictment.
and
finally,
with
respect
to
the
government's
eleventh
hour
effort
to
find
some
limiting
principles
for
its
mail
fraud,
i
took
it
as
quite
interesting
that
in
describing
that
there
must
first
be
a
duty,
mr.
ayer
suggests
that
he
wouldn't
put
primary
emphasis
on
that
point
and
it's
quite
clear
to
me
why
he
wouldn't
do
that
in
this
case
because
wherever
you
look
there
is
simply
no
duty.
and
i
think
ultimately
what
it
came
down
to
was
that
the
duty
that
exists
in
this
case
is
a
federal
duty.
but
that's
not
what
the
mail
fraud
statute
requires.
this
court
made
quite
clear
in
parr
that
you
look
to
other
sources
to
determine
what
is
fraud,
and
the
fraud
in
this
case
is
based
on
a
duty.
you
must
look
to
those
sources
to
find
out
where
that
duty
exists.
there
are
none
accordingly
and
the
petitioner's
conviction
should
be
reversed.
