justice
white
you
mean
a
state
official,
you
mean?
justice
white
he
was
part
of
the
scheme?
justice
white
did
he
have
any
duty
to
disclose?
justice
white
but,
he
was
a
state
official.
justice
white
he
certainly
is
in
a
different
position
than
hunt.
justice
white
did
mr.
gray
get
any
money?
justice
white
did
mr.
gray
get
any
money?
justice
white
he
didn't
get
any
benefit?
justice
white
you
answered
while
ago
that
this
scheme
didn't
involve
any
violation
of
state
law.
i
take
it
means
that
mr.
gray
didn't
violate
state
law
either?
justice
white
well,
he
was
the
insurance
commissioner,
wasn't
he?
justice
white
yeah,
that's
right.
and
why
did
mr.
hunt
want
him
in
the
scheme?
justice
white
--xxx
the
two
parties
here
are
mcnally
and
gray?
justice
white
and
what
was
gray's
offense?
justice
white
and
he
wasn't
charged
as
a
principal?
justice
white
[laughter]
you
mean
if
you
would
have
thought
of
it.
justice
white
xxx.
justice
white
i
mean,
the
court
shouldn't
have
said
you
had
to
find
both.
under
your
theory
it
would
be
a
scheme
to
defraud
if
they
just
found
number
two.
justice
white
so,
the
and
is
really
not
right.
take
advantage
of
it,
so
it's
exactly
right.
justice
white
xxx
one
of
those,
you
proved
the
scheme
described
above.
justice
white
xxx
making
this
argument
to
show
that
the
state
of
kentucky
lost
some
money?
justice
white
is
that
fraud?
you
aren't
arguing
the
state
was
done
out
of
anything?
justice
white
i
thought
you
were
arguing
that
it
wasn't
necessary
at
all
for
kentucky
to
be
cheated
out
of
any
money.
justice
white
it's
just
that
somebody
was
receiving
money
under
false
pretenses
and--
justice
white
--by
concealment
and
things
like
that,
which
is
mail
fraud.
justice
white
so
whoever
would
have
gotten
the
insurance
commissions
were
done
out
of
them?
i
mean,
because
these
two
people
got
them
and
they
weren't
entitled
to
them,
whoever
was
paying
it
to
them
would
have
kept
them.
justice
white
someone
else
would
have
kept
the
money.
someone
else
would
have
got
the
money
xxx.
justice
white
do
you
think
these
instructions
covered
those
elements
insofar
as
this
theory
of
deprivation
is
concerned.
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
instructions
that
suggest
that
these
people
had
any
duty
to,
unless
you
say
that
the
court
must
of
thought
there
was
a
duty
or
they
wouldn't
have
given
this
kind
of
an
instruction
about
disclosure.
justice
white
yes,
i
understand
that.
i
understand.
justice
white
without
disclosing?
justice
white
wouldn't
that
be
a
jury
question,
whether
they
had
the
duty,
or
not?
or
was
that
legal,
some
instruction
the
court
ought
to
give?
justice
white
because
i
don't
see
anything
about
a
duty
to
disclose.
as
far
as
these
instructions
are
concerned,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
whether
there
was
a
duty
to
disclose,
or
not.
justice
white
there
was
a
failure
to
disclose.
justice
white
yes.
yes,
but
it
doesn't
say
that
he
had
a
duty,
or
it
doesn't
ask
the
jury
to
find
it.
if
he
didn't
disclose
it
that
was
all
the
jury
was
interested
in.
justice
white
xxx
did
say
that
the
failure
to
disclose,
if
there
was
a
failure
to
disclose
it
had
to
influence,
if
there
had
been
a
disclosure,
the
conduct
of
other
government
officials
would
have
been
different.
justice
white
well,
if
there
had
been
a--
--xxx
and
if
gray
had
an
ownership
interest,
that
he
failed
to
disclose
that
interest
to
persons
in
state
government
whose
actions
or
deliberations
could
have
been
affected
by
such
action.
justice
white
a
jury
xxx
find
that.
and
so
non-disclosure
with
that
kind
of
a
consequence.
mr.
ayer,
before
you
get
through,
you've
given
us
the
three
parts
of
your
theory
and
the
first
of
which
is
the
duty
that's
enforceable.
what,
at
least
with
regard
to
hunt,
what
is
the
duty
you're
talking
about?
justice
white
yeah.
