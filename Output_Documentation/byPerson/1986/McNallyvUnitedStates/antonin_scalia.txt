justice
scalia
why
is
that
worse
than
ordinary
party
patronage?
i
don't
understand.
justice
scalia
all
of
it
is
fraud
as
far
as
you're
concerned?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
the
theory
being
these
commissions
would
have
been
paid
to
somebody
anyway.
justice
scalia
so--
justice
scalia
although
i
suppose
you
can
say
if
wombwell's
willing
to
split
it
with
other
people,
wombwell
would
also
be
willing
to
charge
less.
justice
scalia
which
would
mean
that
the
state
would
probably
be
able
to
buy
its
insurance
for
less.
justice

xxx.
justice
scalia
well,
but
that's
common
sense
isn't
it?
i
mean,
what
does
wombwell
care.
wombwell's
not
getting
the
money.
they
would
as
soon
give
it
back
to
the
state
as
give
it
to
some
third
party.
justice
scalia
well,
you
say
that
case
is
the
same
as
this
only
insofar
as
your
broader
argument
is
concerned.
that
is
your
attack
on
the
intangible
rights
theory.
justice
scalia
but,
even
we
reject
that
argument,
you
would
still
say
that
kerner
was
a
public
official--
justice
scalia
why
didn't
you
tell
us
that
when
we
were
entertaining
petition
for
cert?
yeah.
justice
scalia
surely
would
have
been
better
for
us
and
maybe
better
for
you.
justice
scalia
it
certainly
isn't
clearly
because
the
court
then
goes
on
to
say
to
find
that
the
defendants,
or
either
of
them,
devise
such
a
scheme,
referring
back
to
the
beginning
of
the
preceding
paragraph.
a
scheme
or
artifice
too.
one
and
two,
which
you
just
quoted.
to
find
that
either
of
them
devise
such
a
scheme
you
must
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
one
of
the
following,
and
then
it
has
one
or
two.
justice
scalia
well,
now,
wait
a
minute.
how
do
you
find
any
obtaining
of
property
in
number
two?
where
is
the,
or,
you
know--
justice
scalia
--yes,
but
you're
still
left
with
whatever
defect
in
hears
in
that
number
two.
and
that,--
justice
scalia
right.
if
it
said
aided
or
abetted,
in
his
official
capacity,
yes.
but
it
doesn't,
it
just
says
aided
or
abetted.
he
could
have
aided
and
abetted
him
as
a
private
citizen.

receiving
commissions.
justice
scalia
still
waiting
to
see
who's
been
done
out
of
money,
you
know?
justice
scalia
here
is
the
analogy
that
i'm,
patronage
systems
were
never
considered
illegal.
i
mean,
that's
why
we
had
to
have
a
law
to
have
the
civil
service.
and
the
theory
was,
somebody
has
to
have
the
job,
you're
going
to
give
the
job
to
somebody,
why
not
give
it
to
our
guys?
that
was
never
thought
unlawful,
or
it
certainly
wasn't
considered
fraud.
now
it
seems
to
me,
you
would
have
to
persuade
me
that
this
is
something
any
different
from
that
to
convince
me
that
it's
fraud.
and
so
far,
you
haven't.
i
don't
see
how
anybody
has
been
done
out
of
any
money.
just,
the
money
has
to
go
to
somebody.
it
might
as
well
go
to
our
guys.
justice
scalia
doesn't
the
false
pretense
have
to
be
a
pretense
to
get
the
property?
that
but
for
that
pretense,
the
property
would
not
have
been
given?
justice
scalia
you
don't
say
i
defraud
somebody
if
i
go
up
and
say,
i'll
buy
your
car
for
$500
and
i
give
him
my
wrong
name.
you
wouldn't
say
that
i
defrauded
him
of
the
car
so
long
as
i
give
him
the
$500.
justice
scalia
xxx
right
it.
it
really
does
you're
telling,
cover
the
case
where
i
go
up
and
buy
a
car
for
$500,
give
my
wrong
name.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
i
have
to
add
a
fact
then.
justice
scalia
this
automobile
dealer
does
not
sell
cars
to
government
employees.
and
i
walk
up
and
i
say,
you
know,
my
name
jones
and
i
am
not
a
government
employee.
he
sells
me
a
car
for
$500.
i

justice
scalia
that's
a
good
old
concept,
intangible
property.
it's
a
little
different
from
intangible
rights
in
that
it
doesn't
include
the
right

for
example.
justice

category.

traditional

category
as
rights
in
stock

so
forth

are
intangibles.
justice
scalia
the
right
to
good
government
is--
justice
scalia
--an
intangible
right
of
which
one
can
be
defrauded.
justice
scalia
you
don't
even
need
standing
to
be
able
to
enforce
that,
do
you.
justice
scalia
i
assume
i
have
no
right
to
sue
for
good
government,
right?
it's
a
right
i
have,
but
it's
not
a
right
i'm
able
to
sue
for.
justice

i
can
sue
somebody
for
defrauding
me
of
it?
