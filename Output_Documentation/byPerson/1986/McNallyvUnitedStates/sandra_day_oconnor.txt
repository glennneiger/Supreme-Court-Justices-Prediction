justice
o'connor
was
there
no
violation
of
state
law
for
these
people
to
get
commissions
for
having
done
no
work?
justice
o'connor
how
about
if
you're
not
a
licensed
agent?
justice
o'connor
and
that
was
involved
here
as
well,
wasn't
it?
justice
o'connor
so,
it's
your
position
that
at
no
time
was
any
kentucky
state
law
violated
here
by
either
of
your
clients?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
phillips,
i
thought
the
government
is
now
telling
us
that
the
jury
was
instructed
that
for
mail
fraud,
the
government
had
to
prove
a
scheme
to
defraud
the
citizens
of
their
right
to
honest
performance
of
public
business
and
to
obtain
money
or
property
by
false
pretenses.
and
that
the
jury
clearly
had
to
find
both
present.
justice
o'connor
and
there
is
such
an
instruction?
justice
o'connor
so
you
think,
the
position
you
take
is
that
the
instructions
as
a
whole
do
not
bear
out
that
argument.
justice
o'connor
even
if
he
did
in
fact
receive
benefits
in
the
form
of
condominium
usage
and
vehicle
usage
and
so
forth
and
so
on
in
florida
and
elsewhere?
justice
o'connor
but,
he
was
empowered
by
the
governor
to
direct
the
receipt
of
these
insurance
commissions?
justice
o'connor
he
was
given
some
kind
of
defacto
duty
to
perform
on
behalf
of
the
state.
justice
o'connor
mr.
phillips,
i
don't
think
our
cases
are
at
common
law
that
it
was
ever
an
element
of
fraud
that
you
had
to
prove
pecuniary
gain
to
the
defendant.
justice
o'connor
maybe
economic
injury
to
the
victim,
but
never
a
requirement
of
gain
to
the
perpetrator.
justice
o'connor
and
that's
what
you
keep
arguing--
justice
o'connor
--is
missing.
and
i
just
don't
see
that
as
an
element
at
all.
justice
o'connor
that
just
isn't
an
element.
yeah.
justice
o'connor
well,
there's
been
a
lot
of
cases
haven't
there
in
which
that
has
not
been
required
under
this
mail
fraud
statute.
you're
looking
at
a
number
of
public
officials
in
other
states
who
have
been
convicted
by
the
use
of
this
statute.
justice
o'connor
without
proof
of
some
kind
of,
much
more
than
an
intangible
right
kind
of
an
argument.
justice
o'connor
what
page
and
what
document?
