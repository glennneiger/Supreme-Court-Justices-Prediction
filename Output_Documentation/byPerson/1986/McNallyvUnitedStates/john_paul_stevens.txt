mr.--
justice
stevens
--mr.
phillips,
may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
something?
is
it
your
position
on
this
the
fact
there
are
no
pecuniary
benefit
and
nothing
but
a
violation
of
an
alleged
duty
to
disclose,
which
you
deny
existed?
would
you
say
the
case
would
be
different
if
he
were
a
state
official?
if
mr.
hunt
were
a
state
official?
justice
stevens
but
your
position
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
the
kerner
case,
or
isaacs
case
rather,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
i
know
it's
not
been
decided
by
this
court,
but
the
decision
governor
kerner's
case,
you
would
require
that
one,
your
position
is
inconsistent
with
the
holding
in
that
case.
justice
stevens
but
no
injury
to
the--
justice
stevens
--i
don't
think
there
was
any
injury,
any
pecuniary
injury
to
the
state
of
illinois.
justice
stevens
it's
the
same.
justice
stevens
but,
then
where
did
the
duty
to
disclose
come
from
there?
cause
the
status
of
a
public
official,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
in
other
accounts,
but
just
on
the
mail
fraud
is
all
i'm
talking--
justice
stevens
--i
understand.
justice
stevens
--oh
yes,
but
not
under
one.
because
under
one
he's
charged
as
an
aider
and
abetter
and
for
that
to
be
wrong,
the
principal,
namely
hunt,
has
to
be
doing
something
wrong.
i
don't
think
you
can
rely
on
gray's
capacity
as
a
public
official
to
satisfy
the
paragraph
one.
justice
stevens
but
that's
not
because
an
aider/abetter
is
it?
i
man,
as
an
aider
and
abetter,
he
has
to
be
aiding
hunt
to
do
what
is
charged
in
that
paragraph.
justice
stevens
that's
mainly
what
the
court
of
appeals
relied
on
as
i
remember
their
opinion.
justice
stevens
xxx
you
said
there's
sufficient
evidence
as
to
the
hunt
charge,
but
they
didn't
really
reach
the
other,
so
we'd
have
to
send
it
back
to
find
out.
justice
stevens
what
is
the
criminal
act,
you
mean
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
stevens
well,
this
kind
of
xxx.
justice
stevens
the
duty
is
a
duty
not
to
violate
the
mail
fraud
statute.
justice
stevens
if
you
prove
a
violation
of
the
mail
fraud
statute
by
proving
you
violated
the
xxx.
justice
stevens
i
have
difficulty
following
that.
justice
stevens
of
course,
the
jury
was
not
required
to
find
they
were
phony
companies,
as
i
read
the
instructions.
they
were
required
that
they
had
a
secret
interest
in
it,
but
they
could
have
had
a
secret
interest
in
a
legitimate
brokerage
firm.
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
the
false
pretenses
are
not
disclosing
the
ownership
interest.
that's
what
the
instruction
says.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
you
argued
at
some
length
the
fact
that
seton
was
a
sort
of
a
shell.
justice
stevens
but
the
jury
wasn't
instructed
to
find
that.
justice
stevens
so,
then
don't
we
have
to
assume
the
case
would
be
the
same
for
legal
purposes
even
if
seton
were
not
a
shell?
cause
we
don't
know
the
jury
thought
it
was.
but
there
still,
you're
not
necessarily
out
of,
totally
lost
because
you
still
then
would
claim
the
failure
to
disclose
the
ownership
interest,
i
guess,
is
enough.
maybe
you
don't
want
to
go
that
far.
but
then
we're
back
to
my
just
giving
the
wrong
name.
and
not
even
saying
that
i'm
not
a
government
employee.
justice
stevens
but
you're
not
saying
that's
the
duty
to
disclose.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
find
out
for--
justice
stevens
--the
duty
to
this
breach
is
the
duty
not
to
violate
the
mail
fraud
statute.
