mr.
donald
b.
ayer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
agrees,
i
think,
with
one
general
proposition
that
is
made
by
the
petitioners
in
this
case.
and
that's
the
point
that
there
is
a
substantial
amount
of
confusion
concerning
this
intangible
rights
mail
fraud
theory.
and
we
would
further
agree
that
there
is
in
some
opinions
of
various
courts
of
appeals,
what
i
would
describe
as
extravagant
language,
talking
in
terms
of
standards
of
moral
uprightness,
fundamental
honesty,
fair
play
and
right
dealing.
but
that's,
i
think,
where
our
agreement
ends
because
first
of
all,
in
terms
of
this
case,
which
is
before
this
court,
that
language
i
think
is
completely
irrelevant.
also,
as
to
the
very
cases
in
which
that
language
appears,
i
think
one
is
hard-pressed
to
find
even
one
where
the
language
itself
is
necessary
to
the
holding
of
the
case
and
indeed
where
the
outcome,
the
decision
and
indeed
the
reasoning,
if
you
read
the
opinion
further,
isn't
well
supported
on
a
much
sounder
and
narrower
theory
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
but
before
we
get
to
that
question
of
intangible
rights,
i
want
to
address
the
first
proposition
made
in
our
brief,
which
is
the
point
that
this
intangible
rights
theory
need
not
and
indeed
i
think,
should
not
be
addressed
in
order
to
resolve
this
case.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
if
we
had
known
it,
we
would
have
told
you.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
yes.
[laughter]
if
we
had
focused
on
the
jury
instructions,
at
the
time
that
we
filed
our
opposition,
which
we
file
i
think
700
or
so
a
year,
indeed
it
would
have
been
much
better
had
we
done
that
for
all
of
us,
i
guess,
but
we
didn't
and
thus
we
didn't
make
the
point.
but
having
discovered
it
when
we
discovered
it
we
felt
like
it
was
only
right
to
bring
it
up
as
soon
as
we
figured
it
out.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we'll
find
out
i
guess.
[laughter]
the
reason
why
i
think
that
the
issue
is
not
presented
comes
from
a
simple
reading
of
the
instructions,
i
wouldn't
represent
that
the
instructions
themselves
are
simple--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
the
government's
brief
at
page
11
indicates
in
footnote
eight.
what
must
be
proved
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
is
that
the
defendant's
knowingly
and
willfully
devised,
or
intended
to
devise
a
scheme
to
defraud
as
described
in
instruction
11.
i
don't
know
why
the
reference
to
instruction
11
because
the
precise
language
of
instruction
11
appears
in
this
instruction
15.
but,
in
any
event,
repeated
twice
is
the
description
of
the
scheme.
repeated
in
instruction
11
and
in
instruction
15.
if
you
look
at
page
nine
at
the
beginning
of
footnote
eight
back
where
it
first
indents,
is
the
reference
to
the
scheme
to
defraud
the
citizens
of
their
right
to
have
the
business
and
it's
affairs
conducted
honestly,
etcetera.
and
then
immediately
following,
the
same
scheme
to
obtain
directly
and
indirectly
money
and
other
things
of
value
by
means
of
false
and
fraudulent
pretenses,
representations
and
promises
and
the
concealment
of
facts.
there
is
no
instruction
as
is
typical
in
situations
where
you
have
multiple
ways
of
violating
a
particular
statute.
there
is
no
instruction
that
says
the
jury
must
agree
unanimously.
i
have
at
least
one
of
these
ways
of
violating
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
exactly
right,
your
honor.
that's
exactly
our
point
is
that
the
jury
was
told
that
they
had
to
find
a
scheme
to
do
both,
or
they
couldn't
convict
and
indeed
they
did
find
a
scheme
to
do
both.
they
found
a
scheme
to
obtain
property
by
false
pretenses
and
having
done
that,
and
we
knowing
that
they
have
done
that
there
is
no
occasion
to
go
further
and
ask
whether
the
theory
and
the
evidence
would
support
the
other
theory
as
well.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think,
if
both--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
correct.
and
i
must
say
when
i
first--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--exactly
right.
yeah.
we
will
take
advantage
of
it
and
i
think
it
is
in
fact,
clearly
what
the
jury
was
told
to
do
and
it's
got
to
be
what
the
jury
xxx.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
and
the
one
or
two,
those
are
references
to
the
roles
played
by
hunt
and
gray.
in
each
of
those
paragraphs,
you
find
discussion
of
the
channeling
of
commissions.
that
is
the
appropriation,
the
obtaining
of
property.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct
and
that
language
plus
the
additional
language
that
says
you
must
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
they
knowingly
devised
the
scheme
above.
xxx.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yeah,
i
do.
it
was
a
matter
under
the
supervisory
authority
of
the
defendant
gray,
a
secretary
of
public
protection
of
regulation
or
secretary
of
the
governor's
cabinet
at
the
time
that
seton
investment
inc.
received
commissions
from
that
insurance
policy.
and
then
they
talk
about
the
ownership
interest
that
gray
had.
so,
there
must
have
been
a
receiving
of
commissions
by
seton.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
will
address
that
now,
your
honor,
as
you
brought
it
up.
that
the
first,
that
is
paragraph
one
requires
in
order
to
convict
mr.
gray
that
he
had
aided
and
abetted
mr.
hunt.
mr.
gray
was
at
all
times
relevant
either
or
both
the
secretary
to
the
cabinet,
or
the
secretary
of
public
protection
in
regulation.
and
in
both
of
those
positions,
in
the
second
position
of
protection
and
regulation,
he
directly
oversaw
the
entire
state
insurance
program.
and
as
secretary
to
the
cabinet,
he
was
one
step
and
oversaw
among
others
the
secretary
of
regulation.
our
theory
is
that
in
order
to
have
found
one,
in
order
to
have
convicted
under
one,
and
who
to
have
convicted
gray
as
the
jury
did,
they
must
have
found
that
gray
aided
and
abetted
hunt.
and
for
gray
in
his
public
position
to
have
been
essentially
turn,
at
least
turning
his
head
to
the
diversion
of
this
money
in
ways
which
in
a
minute
i
will
show
to
have
been
quite
improper.
that
in
itself
constitutes
the
breach
of
a
public
duty.
that
is
his
duty
as
a
public
official.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
we
think
we
can,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
we
do
is
that
there
is
no
dispute
as
to
his
occupying
a
public
position
at
all
times
relevant.
and
the
public
position--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
the
fact
that
most
have
been
found
is
that
gray
aided
and
abetted
the
scheme
that
hunt
was
carrying
out.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
what
might
be
helpful
in
answering
this
question
in
a
slightly,
maybe
circuitous
way,
but
nonetheless
it
may
be
useful
to
refer
to
the
facts
in
the
case
and
in
order
to
that
in
a
brief
way,
i
have
submitted
through
the
clerk,
copies
of
exhibits
that
were
used
at
trial.
and
what
they
do,
i'm
not
going
to
go
through
them
line
by
line,
but
they
were
indeed
used
in
trial
to
demonstrate
the
evidence
in
the
case
in
a
fairly
brief
and
concise
way.
exhibits
one
and
two
are
essentially
flow
charts
of
the
way
the
money
flowed
from
the
commonwealth
of
kentucky
to,
in
premium
payments,
to
two
different
insurance
companies
and
then
the
commission's
coming
back
from
the
carriers
to
the
wombwell
agency.
the
wombwell
agency
being
the
broker
who
got
the
business
and
agreed
to
handle
this
workman's
compensation
business
for
$50,000
a
year
and
then
at
hunt's
request
agreed,
take
that
$50,000
and
i,
hunt,
as
head
of
the
democratic
party
will
tell
you
where
to
send
the
rest
of
the
commissions
that
you
get
back.
the
key
part
of
these
diagrams.
number
one
covers
the
period
of
1976,
i
guess
'76
through
the
middle
of
'77
and
then
other
one
covers
the
period
'77
through
'79.
is
what
happens
with
the
money,
the
premium,
i'm
sorry
the
commission
payments
once
hey
come
back
to
the
wombwell
agency
and
what
these,
the
little
boxes
over
on
the
right
hand
side
show,
are
the
channeling
of
the
checks
to
two
different
places.
one
is
to
seton
investments.
now
seton
investments
as
we've
indicated
in
our
brief
is
an
entity
which
was
created
by
hunt
and
gray.
it
was
set
up
as
a
real
estate
investment
company,
but
in
fact,
transacted
no
real
estate
business
except
the
purchase
of
two
condominiums,
which
the
evidence
showed
was
for
the
personal
use
of
gray
and
hunt.
it
purported
to
be
for
purposes
of
this
scheme
because
it
had
to
be
under
state
law
an
insurance
brokerage
entity.
in
fact,
it
transacted
and
the
evidence
showed
it
transacted
no
insurance
business
whatsoever.
it
did
not
have
an
insurance
license.
it
put
on
forms
which
were
submitted
to
the
wombwell
agency
as
proof.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that
was
the
business
it
was
in,
justice
white.
and
that
is
illegal
under
state
law.
it
is
illegal
under
the
provision
of
state
law,
under
kentucky
revised
statute
34.9-100,
which
we've
cited
in
our
brief,
says
that
it
is
not
a
proper
purpose
of
an
insurance
license
to
have
it
for
the
purpose
and
solely
for
the
purpose
of
enabling
the
licensee
to
receive
rebates
or
premiums.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
they
probably
foresaw
situations
like
it,
given
the
existence
of
this
kind
of
a
patronage
system
in
kentucky,
and
given
the
acceptability
under
another
provision,
of
splitting
of
commissions.
they
wanted
to
make
clear
that
this
kind
of
situation
is
not
acceptable.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
who
has
been
done
out
of
money,
number
one,
we
would
dispute
and
there
is
evidence
i
think
in
the
record
that
supports
the
dispute
that
there
was
simply
no
way
for
kentucky
to
do
anything
other
than
pay
the
money
that
it
paid
and
to
have
the
premiums
that
were
paid,
i'm
sorry,
the
commissions
that
were
paid
back
to
wombwell
paid
in
a
certain
amount.
it
is
true
that
there's
a
regional
commission
that
is
set
up.
i
think
it's
basically
part
of
the
insurance
industry
that
studies
and
decides
what
a
reasonable
commission
is
on
a
certain
kind
of
policy.
it
is
always
possible
to
renegotiate
something
like
that
and
indeed
there
is
testimony
in
the
record
that
there,
that
that
is
a
possibility.
it
was
never
done
here--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no,
i
am
not.
i'm
trying
to
answer
justice
scalia's
question
as
to
who
was
done
out
of
money.
it
is
indeed
the
case
that
had
people
been
public
watchdogs,
looking
for
where
the
money's
going,
it
would
have
come
out
differently.
that's
not
the
point.
that's
not
the
reason
why
this
is
illegal.
this
is
illegal,
what
i'd
like
to
do
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no.
we
are
not
and
we
did
not
at
trial.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it's
different.
i
am
not
sure
how
much
we
can
make
of
that
given
the
premise
that
we
all
start
from
that
this
patronage
scheme
is
legal
and
therefore,
it's
perfectly
legal
for
someone
out
dole
out
money
to
his
friends.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct.
what
has
been
done
here,
what
i'd
like
to
do
is
start
with
the
proposition
that,
hypothetically
speaking,
let's
forget
that
these
people
are
in
fact,
public
officials.
let's
leave
that
out
of
it.
as
i
think
we
have
demonstrated
in
our
brief,
what
was
done
was
a,
what
was
shown
was
a
complete
scheme
for
obtaining
property
by
false
pretenses.
the
false
pretenses
are
the
setting
up
a
phony
insurance
brokerage
outfit
for
the
purpose
of
making
it
appear
acceptable
to
channel
this
commission
money
to
them.
under
state
law
it
is
illegal
to
split
commissions
with
anyone
other
than
an
insurance
broker
or
agency.
and
so
what
they
did
was
to
create
this
entity
as
an
independent
company,
disassociate
themselves,
that
is
gray
and
hunt,
from
it
by
bringing
in
at
least
at
a
late
date,
mcnally,
to
serve
as
its
president
and
act
like
this
is
an
independent
entity
that
mcnally
is
in
charge
of.
and
indeed
at
trial
the
argument
was
that
mcnally
owns
this.
this
is
all
his,
we
don't
own
it,
that
is
gray
and
hunt
don't
own
it,
mcnally
owns
it.
that
scheme,
just
leaving
out
the
element
of
public
official
and
public
obligation
is
in
and
of
itself,
that
deception
to
allow
the
channeling
of
money
to
seton,
which
indeed
then
goes
essentially
to
the
use,
as
is
indicated
on
our
exhibit
three,
to
the
use
of
these
individuals
in
the
form
of
condominiums.
that
is
itself
a
complete
mail
fraud
scheme.
a
scheme
for
obtaining
property
by
false
pretenses
and
we
believe
that
that
is
the
first
and
easiest
way
to
resolve
the
case.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--it
wouldn't
have
been
possible
for,
even
if
they
weren't
public
officials,
it
wouldn't
have
been
possible
for
either
gray
or
hunt
to
walk
up
and
say
give
me
commissions.
even
if
they
were
politically
influential
because
they
are
not
insurance
brokers.
and
they
do
not
have
the
requisite
license
to
make
it
legal
under
state
law
to
participate
in
this
particular
form
of
patronage.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think,
well
the
whole
idea
was
to
take
this
pot
full
of
money
which
amounted
$850,000
over
four
years
and
spread
it
around.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
someone
else
would
have
gotten
it,
but
i
don't
think
it
would
have
been
somebody
who
could
of
claimed
he
had
a
right
to
it.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
someone
else
would
in
all
likelihood
of
been,
some
other
insurance
brokerage,
i
should
say
some
insurance
brokerage
outfit
in
the
state
of
kentucky
who
had
been
supportive
of
the
governor
and
the
administration.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
our
theory
is
that,
well,
i
don't
think
it's
just
our
theory.
it's
very
clear
as
to
this
first
cut,
leaving
out
the
public
official
and
the
public
intangible
right
element.
it's
very
clear
that
what
was
proven
on
this
first
level
was
a
scheme
to
obtain
property
by
false
pretenses.
the
false
pretenses
being
the
creation
of
this
seton
outfit
which
is
phony.
never
does
any
business
and
just
is
there
to
receive
money
and
channel
it
to
gray
and
hunt.
that,
in
and
of
itself,
the
obtaining
of
that
property,
forgetting
about
who
is
hurt,
there
is
no
requirement
in
the
law
that
someone
be
harmed
as
a
result--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
is
emphatically
clear--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
it's
emphatically
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
that
is
true.
because
the
statute
has
three
different
clauses.
the
first
one
is
for
creating,
or
putting
into
effect
a
scheme
to
defraud,
or
for
obtaining
money
or
property
by
false
pretenses.
that
is
exactly
what
was
done
here,
was
the
obtaining
of
money
or--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
i
don't
think
so,
because
i
think
you're
giving
your
wrong
name
is
no
part
of
inducing
the
obtaining
of
money
or
property.
he
wasn't
relying
on
the
fact
that
you
gave
a
wrong
name.
whereas
here,
they
very
much
are
relying
on
the
fact
that
seton
is
supposed
to
be,
and
indeed
to
illustrate
that,
the
wombwell
agency,
mr.
tabeling
specifically
asked
more
than
once
for
assurance
that
seton
was
in
fact,
a
legitimate
insurance
agency.
and
so
what
he
was
given--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--was
the
insurance
license
number
of--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
that
as
a
technical
matter
you
may
well
have.
if
it
is
material
and
if
you
have
a
duty
not
to
lie
to
him,
which
i
think
is
fair
to
say
you
do.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
what
we
would
suggest
as
a
description
of
what
must
be
shown,
as
a
set
of
requirements
under
this
intangible,
first
of
all,
let
me
say,
i
think
it
makes
very
little
sense
to
conclude
that
somehow
the
mail
fraud
statute
doesn't
cover
schemes
to
defraud
of
intangible
rights.
if
you
define
an
intangible
right
as
any
right
other
than
the
physical
possession
of
something.
you
talk
about
a
right
to
a
stream
of
income
under
a
contract.
or,
you
talk
about
a
right
to
purchase
a
piece
of
property.
you
talk
about
almost
any
right
in
our
society.
very
few
people
walk
around
with
gold
bars
in
their
pocket.
most
people
rely
on
intangible
rights.
and
so,
as
an
opening
proposition,
we've
got
to
be
all
assuming
that
the
mail
fraud
statute
can
reach
some--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--intangible
property.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i'm
not
sure
i
know
where
it
begins
and
ends.
if
i
have
expectations
that
have
value,
is
that
intangible
property?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
do
i
think
what
is?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
in
the
following,
when
you
meet
the
following
set
of
requirements
the
answer
would
be
yes.
and
this
is
what
we
would
be
suggesting
as
a
substitute
for
what
i
referred
to
earlier
as
the
extravagant
language
of
some
opinions.
number
one,
that
there
must
be
the
duty
that
you're
talking
about
has
got
to
be
an
enforceable
duty
of
some
kind.
the
thing
you're
being
defrauded
out
of
is
not
just
a
moral
aspiration.
it's
got
to
be
a
real
duty.
it
can
arise
from
the
criminal
law.
it
can
arise
from
the
civil
law.
it
can
rise
from
a
statute,
or
the
common
law.
and
we
would
suggest
it
can
arise
from
contract.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no,
xxx.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
the
state
in
dealing
with--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
the
state
can
sue,
or
can
bring
a
criminal
action
for
defrauding
it
of
the
right
to
honest
services
of
its
employees.
or
the
honest
services
of
people
who
have
been
given
trusted,
trusted
with
responsibilities.
but,
that's
only
the
first
part.
that's
the
first
step.
the
second
step
is
that
there
must
be
a
causal
relationship
between
the
breach
of
that
duty
and
either
the
appropriation
or
the
deprivation
of
a
thing
of
value.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
simply
the
abstract
non-performance
of
a
duty
is
a
sufficient
basis
to
bring
a
criminal
action.
we
think
that
it
is
quite
appropriate
to
require
that
the
breach
of
the
duty
have
some
kind
of
a
consequence
and
in
this
case
the
consequence,
well
let
me
skip
over
this
case
for
a
minute.
the
third
element
would
be
an
element
of
deception.
which
is
a
traditional
element
of
the
mail
fraud
statute.
that
there
must
be
some
effort
to
cover
up
the
scheme
to
deceive,
to
essentially
hide
what's
going
on.
and
when
you
put
those
three
things
together,
i
would
submit
what
you
have
is
really
only
another
way
of
saying
what
is
going
on
in
a
more
traditional
property
oriented
male
fraud
case.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
we,
just
to
repeat
briefly,
we
think
first
that
the
case
should
be
resolved
as
one
for
obtaining
property
xxx
pretenses.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
leaving
that
aside
i
think
the
instructions
in
their
references
to
the
directing
of
commissions
and
to
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
and
to
the
positions,
there's
two
different
things
we
have
to
talk
about.
one
is
the
position
of
gray
and
whether
is
position
and
the
duties
that
he
owed
were
sufficient.
and
we
think
that
that
can
be
a
basis
for
deciding
the
case
under
either
xxx.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--what,
the
discussion--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--the
discussion
that
does
exist
is
the
discussion
of
gray's
position
as
secretary
and
the
positions
that
he
held.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
there's
two
different
things
going
on
here.
one
is
the
duty
to
disclose.
and
we
would
not
put
primary
emphasis
on
that.
what
i
would
suggest
is
that
starting
with
the
premise
that
there
was
an
obtaining
of
property
by
false
pretenses,
how
was
it
done?
it
was
done
by
these
two
individuals
setting
up
the
scheme
and
it
happens
that
hunt
was
imbued
with
official
power,
that
is,
the
governor
told
him
that
he
had
the
power
to
pick
the
insurance
companies
and
to
direct
the
commissions.
and
secondly,
gray
was
in
a
position
overseeing
all
of
this
and
a
lot
of
other
activity.
what
had
to
happen
was
the,
by
hunt,
the
misuse
of
his
position
and
of
his
authority.
he
had
to
misuse
state
governmental
power
to
direct
this
money
to
himself.
that's
the
first
thing
that
had
to
happen.
and,
gray
had
to,
in
his
position,
essentially
at
a
minimum,
look
the
other
way
and
happily
receive
the
money
at
the
other
end.
and
we
think
the
use
of
state
governmental
power
essentially
to
commit
a
federal
mail
fraud
and
that's
going
back
to
the
first
step.
that
is
apart
from
their
state
governmental
authority,
they
committed
a
mail
fraud.
the
use
of
power
to
do
that
is
a
separate
abuse
of
authority,
that
is,
an
abuse
of
the
governmental
authority.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
know
if
that's
in
here,
your
honor.
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--okay.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
with
regard
to
hunt?
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
with
regard
to
hunt,
if
you
have
to
reach
that,
and
we
submit
you
don't,--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
that's
right.
but,
it's
usual
i
think,
not
to
decide
cases
where
they
are
not
going
to
affect
the
outcome.
but
the
duties--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--right.
the
duty
was
a
duty
not
to
misuse
the
governmental
authority
which
was
given
to
him
to
commit
what
is
apart
from
his
duties
as
a
governmental
official,
a
criminal
act.
that
is
the
scheme
for
obtaining
property
by
false
pretenses.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
yes.
he--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that
the
whole,
as
i
indicated
before,
the
whole
scheme--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--that's
right.
that
he
as
a--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--okay.
well,
what
we
tried
to
show
is
that
the
initial,
the
scheme
to
obtain
property
by
using
seton,
a
phony
shell
company
as
a
recipient
for
money.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
they
were
required
to
find
a
scheme
for
obtaining
property
by
false
pretenses.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
there's
got
to
be
some
false
pretenses.
if
there's
no
false
pretenses
then
xxx--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well
they
certainly
could
also
be
the,
and
the
bulk
of
the
evidence
in
the
case
certainly
dealt
with
the
channeling
of
money
to
seton.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
what
the
case
was
about.
that's
what
the
time
in
court
was
spent
on
was
showing
this
money,
check
after
check
after
check
going
to
seton.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
right.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
don't
believe
that
there's
anything
in
the
jury
instructions
that
says
the
jury
had
to
find
specifically
that
seton
was
a
shell.
they
had
to
find
a
scheme
to
defraud
by
obtaining
property.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
what
is
critical
is
that
there
be
a
linkage
between
the
duty
that's
breached,
which
we
are
arguing
is--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
there
is
a
duty
to
disclose.
the
only
reason
i
am
hesitant
to
rely
primarily
on
that
is
that
i
frankly
think
the
basic
scheme
to
defraud,
that
is
to
get
the
money,
by
using
seton
is
a
more
persuasive
fraud.
there
is
indeed
a
duty,
on
the
part
of
a
public
official
to
disclose
and
i
think,
i
would
argue
if
we
had
say
it
to
get,
you
know,
to
resolve
the
case
which
i
think
we
don't
for
at
least
two
other
reasons.
that
there's
a
duty
on
the
part
of
hunt
to
disclose
based
on
his
use
of
governmental
authority.
i
see
my
time
is
expired.
thank
you.
