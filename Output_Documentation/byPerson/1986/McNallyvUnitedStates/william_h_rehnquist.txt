chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
phillips,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--the
theory
is
that
so
much
commission
was
going
to
be
paid
to
wombwell,
what
by
the
company
or
by
the
kentucky
government?
chief
justice
rehnquist
by
the
under--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--when
you
say
xxx.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
you
say
it's
a
commission
paid
back
by
the
underwriter,
who
is
the
underwriter
in
this
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
they're--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--it's
basically
a
discount?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
they're
paying
the
agent
for
having
gotten
the
business?
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
way
other
insurance
commissioners
would.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
they
were
going
to
pay
a
specified
amount
to
wombwell
and
these
people's
theory
is
if
wombwell
wanted
to
split
it
up
with
other
people
that
was
a
private
arrangement.
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx.
chief
justice
rehnquist
who
again
was
mr.
hunt?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
we'll
hear
now
from
you
mr.
ayer.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
mr.
ayer,
that
instruction
does
charge
that,
devised
a
scheme
or
artifice
to
and
then
it's
a
conjunctive
not
a
disjunctive
that
links
one
or
two
which
suggests
that
the
scheme
or
artifice
embodied
both
(a)(1)
and
(2).
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
they
foresaw
this
situation?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
certainly
isn't
a
crime
to
fail
to
get
the
lowest
possible
price
you
can
for
the
state
in
dealing
with
insurance
people,
or
auto
people,
or
anything
else.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
take
it
you
are
arguing
that
simply
receiving
premium
payments
in
the
mail
is
different
from
getting
paid
for
a
job
that
you
perform.
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
so
that's
the
person
who
is
economically
injured?
someone
else
who
is
waiting
in
line
and
didn't
get
there
in
time.
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you
said,
justice
o'connor
made
the
point
a
while
ago
that
fraud
doesn't
ordinarily
require
that
the
defendant
may
have
gained,
but
i
had
thought
at
least
fraud
required
that
there
had
been
some
economic
injury
to
someone.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say,
not
only
need
their
be
no
gain,
but
there
not
need
be
any
harm.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
is
it
prohibited?
[laughter]
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
that
were
the
only
permissible
interpretation
of
a
federal
criminal
statute,
i
would
think
a
court
would
be
fairly
loathe
to
reach
that.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ayer.
mr.
phillips,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
phillips.
the
case
is
submitted.
