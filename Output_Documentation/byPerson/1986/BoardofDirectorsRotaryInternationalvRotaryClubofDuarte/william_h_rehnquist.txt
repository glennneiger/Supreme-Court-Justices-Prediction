we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
86-421,
board
of
directors
of
rotary
international
against
rotary
club
of
duarte.
mr.
sutter,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist

if
international
doesn't
have
any
members
of
its
own,
it's
hard
to
frame
a
constitutional
argument
on
the
right
of
association
for
the
international,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
do
we
get
to
that
question
in
the
case
of
the
duarte
club,
which
wanted
to
admit
women?
i
mean,
its
conduct
doesn't
violate
the
unruh
act
in
the
eyes
of
the
california
court,
does
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sutter.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
resnik.
chief
justice
rehnquist

challenge
then
the
right...
their
right
to...
your
opponents'
right
to
bring
their
case
here
by
way
of
appeal.
you
just
say
that
the
appeal
should
have
been
dismissed
for
want
a
substantial
federal
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
resnik.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
johnston.
