justice
jr.
ms.
johnston,
before
you
start,
would
you
identify
the
federal
question
that's
presented
by
this
case?
justice
jr.
was
that
question
raised
in
the
complaint?
justice
jr.
but
was
there
any
allegation
of
a
federal
right
involved
in
the
complaint?
justice
jr.
did
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
california
decide
any
federal
question?
justice
jr.
the
only
federal
case
it
cited,
if
i
remember
correctly,
was
roberts.
but
it
did
not
expressly
conclude
that
there
was
any
violation
of
the
federal
constitution
that
i
recall.
justice
jr.
but
did
it
make
any
decision
under
the
federal
constitution?
justice
jr.
well,
i
don't
want
to
interrupt
your
short
argument.
but
i'll
look
more
carefully
at
the
opinion.
i
don't
recall
seeing
any
discussion,
any
specific
discussion,
of
a
federal
right.
