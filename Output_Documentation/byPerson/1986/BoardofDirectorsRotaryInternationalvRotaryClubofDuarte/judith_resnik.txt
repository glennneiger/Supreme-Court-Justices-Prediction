ms.
judith
resnik
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court.
duarte,
which
is
a
local
rotary
club,
and
the
state
of
california,
agree
that
it's
absolutely
essential
for
women
to
be
able
to
participate
in
the
rotary
international
organization,
and
in
the
rotary
clubs
of
california.
rotary
is
a
service
and
business
organization.
to
be
selected
to
be
a
member
of
rotary,
one
has
to
be
a
leader
in
the
professional,
crafts
or
business
communities.
and
the
point
of
rotary
is
to
render
service
to
those
communities
to
alter
business
practices
for
the
better.
the
harm
to
women
by
its
being
excluded
is
enormous,
because
the
communication
to
us
is
that
we're
second
class
citizens,
that
we
aren't
business
leaders;
that
one
could
have
a
club
that
is
a
true
cross-section
of
the
business
community
and
exclude
us.
and
california
has
a
strong,
important
interest
in
the
ending
of
discrimination
against
women
and
other
minorities.
this
court
has
reserved
the
question
of
jurisdiction
until
this
time.
the
jurisdictional
question,
either
by
appeal
or
certiorari,
depends
upon
the
existence
of
a
substantial
federal
question.
it
is
our
view,
both
the
state
of
california
and
myself
on
behalf
of
duarte,
that
there...
that
there
is
no
substantial
federal
question,
because
this
case
is
governed
by,
and
the
outcome
is
the
same
as,
the
jaycees
case.
however,
there
are
a
couple
of
distinctions
that
arguably
could
be
drawn.
first,
the
state
of
california...
or
actually,
second,
the
state
of
california
will
be
discussing
the
differences
in
the
california
statute;
its
version
of
a
public
accommodations
law,
and
how
it
differs
from
that
at
issue.
ms.
judith
resnik
well,
we
have
challenged...
as
we
believe
they
started
out,
this
case
was
not
appropriate
for
appeal,
although
by
the
time
they
worked
it
to
this
court,
there
may
be
grounds
for
appeal.
many
commentators,
members
of
this
court
as
well
as
others,
have
suggested
that
the
distinctions
between
appeal
and
certiorari
have
made
life
difficult
for
all
of
us,
and
have
urged
that
this
court
no
longer
have
a
mandatory
jurisdiction.
if
it's
here
either
under
appeal
or
certiorari,
it's
because
there
is
a
substantial
federal
question.
we
do
continue
to
suggest
that
appeal
is
inappropriate,
but
on
the
certiorari
side,
the
question
would
be
whether
or
not
there
is
this
issue
of
national
significance.
and
that
gets
me
immediately
to
the
procedural
posture
of
this
case.
the
procedural
posture
is
that
a
local
club
admitted
women,
and
the
international
expelled
it.
the
california
court
of
appeals
held
and
enjoined
the
international
from
expelling
a
local
that
wanted
to
admit
women.
it
is
true
that
in
passing
the
california
court
of
appeals
did
discuss
that
the
local
duarte
might
be
subject...
or
was
subject
to
the
unruh
act,
but
that
wasn't
essential
to
its
holding.
there
are
two
reasons
why
the
court
ought
not
to
reach
beyond
the
holding
in
this
case.
the
first
is
the
practical
point
that
not
only
is
it
that
that's
not
the
case
here,
that's
not
even
the
case
coming
down
the
pike.
to
my
knowledge,
there
are
no
cases
pending...
and
i
think
here
i
agree
with
my
adversary...
not
only
in
terms
of
rotary
but
in
terms
of
similar
clubs
like
kiwannis
and
lions.
none
of
these
cases--
ms.
judith
resnik
--i
am
agreeing
with
the
thrust
of
some
of
the
comments
that
the--
ms.
judith
resnik
--i'm
sorry.
i...
i
am
saying
that
the
international
is
subject
to
the
unruh
act,
and
may
not
exclude
the
local.
ms.
judith
resnik
even
if
the
local
could
legally
exclude
women.
however,
the
court
of
appeals
here
found
that
this
local
could
not
legally
exclude
women
as
well.
but
i'm
suggesting--
ms.
judith
resnik
--yes,
the
court
of
appeals--
ms.
judith
resnik
--the
court
of
appeals
found
that
both
the
international
and
the
local,
in
dicta,
was
a
businesslike
organization;
and
therefore,
under
california's
interpretation
of
its
statute,
that
both
of
these
organizations
had
sufficient
businesslike
attributes
so
as
to
be
regulated
by
the
state
of
california's
antidiscrimination
laws.
but
the
reason
not
to
move
beyond
is
that
although...
i
guess
i
disagree
with
the
notion
that
either
women
or
members
of
other
minorities
have
been
shy
in
bringing
lawsuits
claiming
their
rights
of
admission.
around
the
country
locals
of
rotary,
kiwannis,
and
lions
have
been
admitting
women;
and
it's
the
international
or
national
organizations
that
are
saying,
no,
you
can't.
so
that
the
rights
at
stake
here
are
the
rights
of
the
international
to
be
subject
to
california
law.
and
here,
the
international,
with
its
350-person
staff,
with
a
publishing
wing
with
a
multimillion
dollar
budget,
is
clearly
a
kind
of
businesslike
organization
that
is
legally
subject
both
under
the
statutory
interpretation
under
california
law,
and
constitutionally
subject
to
california
law
as
well.
ms.
judith
resnik
sorry,
talking
too
fast.
ms.
judith
resnik
i'm
saying
that
i
don't
want
to--
ms.
judith
resnik
--certainly.
ms.
judith
resnik
it
certainly
is
violating
the
california
laws
and
it's
constitutional
for
california
to
enforce
its
law
against
them.
i
don't
want
to
seem
to
be
ducking
the
question
of
the
local
clubs
in
any
way,
however.
and
i
do
want
to--
ms.
judith
resnik
--yes.
ms.
judith
resnik
well,
not
to
echo
too
much
your
comments
in
the
earlier
portion
of
this
argument,
california
can
only
enforce
its
law
in
california;
and
the
choice
is
of
course
open
to
rotary,
should
it
choose
to
withdraw
from
the
state
of
california,
and
thereby
continue
its
all-male
status,
if
that
would
be
permitted
in
other
states.
california
can't
tell
an
iowa
club
what
to
do.
it
can
only
tell
clubs
operating
in
california
that
they
are
bound
by
california
law.
ms.
judith
resnik
the
order
says
that
rotary
is
forbidden
from
expelling
this
club,
that's
correct.
presumably,
and
i'm
a
little
reluctant
to
speak
for
the
court
of
appeals
were
they
faced
with
that
question,
presumably
what
would
happen
if
rotary
said
we
hereby...
rotary
international
said,
we
hereby
withdraw
from
california,
i
would
be
amazed
if
the
california
court
of
appeals
would
say,
we
enjoin
you
from
withdrawing
from
california.
ms.
judith
resnik
no,
i
would
disagree.
they
can
withdraw
totally
from
the
state.
they
can't
be
in
the
state
of
california,
operating
under
california
law.
and
presumably
we
have
a
strong
tradition
among
the
50
states,
not
only
in
their
public
accommodations
law,
which
vary,
but
in
many
other
state
laws
that
vary
from
state
to
state.
multistate
corporations
and
multistate
organizations
are
often
subject
to
different
laws
in
different
states,
and
we
all
live
with
that
as
one
of
the
joys
or
sorrows
of
the
federal
system.
the...
i
think
it's
very
important
to
understand--
ms.
judith
resnik
--unless
they
choose
to
withdraw.
ms.
judith
resnik
and
it
is...
it
is--
ms.
judith
resnik
--it
is
certainly
my
interpretation
of
the
california
court
of
appeals,
that
the
california
court
of
appeals
did
not
say,
we
enjoin
you
from
withdrawing
from
the
state
of
california.
the
california
court
of
appeals
said,
we
enjoin
you
from
expelling
duarte
while
you're...
implicitly...
while
you're
here.
and
if
you
choose
to
leave,
of
course,
i
do
not
believe
the
state
of
california
could
do
anything
about
that.
but
to
return
again
to
this
question.
practically,
there's
no
case
coming
down
the
pike
that
involves
an
individual
knocking
on
a
door
and
a
local
saying
no.
and
jurisprudentially,
there's
a
real
reason
to
pause,
which
goes
to
the
question
of,
what
are
the
nature
of
the
rights
here
at
the
stake?
international
says
that
essentially,
under
the
jaycees'
rubric,
it
has
two
kinds
of
rights:
expressive
freedoms
and
associational
freedoms
of
intimacy.
the
court
in
the
jaycees
opinion
explained
the
two
kinds
of
rights
that
are
available.
on
the
expressive
side
this
court
discussed
the
ability
of
a
group
to
come
together
to
advocate
political,
social,
religious
interests,
and
to
come
together.
and
the
question
in
the
test
was,
would
the
inclusion
of
any
of
these
out-group
members
in
any
way
impair
or
impede
the
original
members
coming
together
and
advocating
their
rights?
if
anything,
the
rotary
international
presents
an
easier
example
than
did
the
jaycees.
rotary
is
avowedly
apolitical
and
a
religious.
unlike
the
jaycees,
where
there
was
both
the
creed
and
the
organization
did
from
time
to
time
take
political
positions,
rotary
is
forbidden,
the
international
and
the
local
clubs,
from
taking
any
kinds
of
positions
on
any
political
or
controversial
matters
whatsoever.
further,
rotary
says,
we
have
three
expressed
purposes:
humanitarian
service,
worldwide
peace,
and
improving
the
ethical
standards
in
the
business
communities.
and
in
order
to
do
that,
we're
going
to
take
a
cross-section
of
business
leaders
from
a
community
to
do
service
in
the
business
world.
there
is
absolutely
nothing
about
the
admission
of
women
that
will
distort,
capture
the
agenda,
or
in
anyway
co-opt
rotary
from
doing
what
it
wanted
to
do.
in
fact,
duarte
admitted
women
because
it
said,
in
our
community
a
third
of
the
business
leaders
are
women,
and
the
only
way
we
can
be
a
cross
section
and
influence
our
community
for
the
good
is
to
include
women.
moreover,
rotary
international
permits
the
inclusion
of
women
in
many
of
its
activities.
it
runs
programs
for
14
to
18-year-olds,
and
for
18
to
28-year-olds;
women
and
men,
girls
and
boys,
are
full
participants
in
those
organizations
as
well.
rotary
invites
women
as
speakers.
women
are
invited
as
guests,
as...
awards
have
been
given
to
women.
so
it's...
so
that
there's
not
a
hint
or
a
whisper
that
including
women
will
in
any
way
do
any
kind
of
harm
to
the
expressive
interests.
on
the
intimacy
side,
the
international
is
an
association
of
clubs;
not
an
association
of
members.
in
the
jaycees'
case,
the
members
were
members
of
the
national
organization.
in
the
international
rotary,
clubs
are
members
of
the
international
organization.
there
is
unquestionably
some
difference
in
the
way
one
became
a
jaycee
and
the
way
one
becomes
a
rotarian.
jaycees
between
the
ages
of
18
and
35,
submitting
an
application
and
paying
some
dues,
if
you
were
male,
you
became
a
jaycee.
to
become
a
rotarian,
there
is
some
selectivity,
and
that's
not
disputed,
although
there
is
a
dispute
about
how
selective
it
is.
but
the
court
of
appeals
and
rotary
of
duarte,
as
well
as
seattle
and
san
francisco
and
the
other
clubs
that
have
admitted
women,
have
presented
arguments
that
it
is,
in
fact,
quite
easy
to
become
a
rotarian.
but
it's
undisputed
that
there's
some
degree
of
selectivity.
there's
selectivity
in
businesses
as
well.
the
fact
of
selectivity
alone
is
not
a
trump
card
that
prevents
a
state
from
imposing
its
statute,
constitutionally,
in
an
organization.
just
as
a
business
is
subject
to
title
vii,
so
may
organizations
that
have
some
degree
of
selectivity
be
subject
to
states'
antidiscrimination
laws.
one
has
to
not
just
say
selectivity.
one
has
to
say
selectivity
for
what.
this
court
has
defined
the
right
of
intimate
association,
in
the
constitutional
sense,
as
a
term
of
art;
a
constitutional
term.
it
is
a
very
limited
right.
parental
decisions
vis-a-vis
children.
decisions
about
marriage.
family
relations
and
family-type
associations.
this
court
has
never
extended
that
right
beyond
to
the
kind
of
large
collections
that
a
rotary
club
by
definition
is.
a
local
rotary
club
cannot
start
unless
there
are
at
least
20
members
fitting
20
different
business
classifications.
and
then
there
have
to
be
another
20
potential
classifications.
we
know
from
the
record
that
the
clubs
range
in
size
from
20
to
over
900
people.
furthermore,
every
local
rotary
club
must,
as
a
matter
of
international
practice,
admit
any
of
the
other
roughly
one
million
rotary...
rotarians
from
around
the
world
to
their
meetings.
and
further,
local
rotary
club
members
are
encouraged
to
invite
students,
members
of
the
media,
salespersons,
employees,
various
guests
to
come
and
come
to
the
meetings.
so
the
meetings
are
not
collections
of
intimates
who
spend
unending
numbers
of
hours
one
with
another.
the
meetings
are
collections
of
loosely-knit
group
of
people
who've
come
together
for
the
betterment
of
all
of
us,
for
the
community
and
for
the
business
and
professional
life.
that's
not
the
kind
of
intimacy
that
this
court
has
announced
is
protected.
really,
what
rotary
international
is
saying
here
is,
develop
a
new
constitutional
right
on
behalf
of
us.
and
precisely
because
it's
this
expansion
of
a
right
that
would
function
to
stop
a
legitimate
state
statute,
it
would
be
tremendously
important
to
have
an
example
of
a
real,
live
club
that
might
prompt
such
a
right;
a
seven-person
poker
club;
a
children's
club.
there
may
be
examples
of
collections
of
people
that
this
court
might
want
to
think
about
developing
some
form
of
a
new
right,
but
surely
not
on
this
record,
with
rotary
telling
us
that
the
heart
of
rotary
is
not
even
its
clubs,
but
rather,
its
service
to
the
community.
mr.
pigman,
the
general
secretary
of
rotary,
testified
that,
after
he
explained
what
a
rotary
meeting
was
like
in
terms
of
that
time,
he
went
on
to
testify:
but
you
know
the
heart
of
rotary
isn't
really
the
clubs.
to
really
understand
rotary,
you've
got
to
go
out
into
the
community,
because
rotary
is
engaged
in
service
activities
in
the
community.
and
in
those
service
activities,
rotary
joins
together
with
many
other
groups
in
the
community;
with
groups
that
admit
women
as
well
as
with
groups
that
don't,
in
doing
better
for
the
professional
and
business
world.
i
do
want
to
just
also,
i
guess,
reinforce
the
notion
that
the
fact
that
there
be
some
chemistry
or
some...
mr.
pigman
testified
that
it
might
feel
different
in
terms
of
the
rotary
international
rubric,
is
something
that
is...
it
may
be
true,
but
it
is
not
that
from
which
new
constitutional
rights
emerge.
presumably
innkeepers
20
years
ago,
when
faced
with
public
accommodation
laws,
said,
it's
going
to
feel
different
to
have
blacks
in
inns
or
swimming
pools
or
parks.
but
this
court
did
not
say,
that's
a
trump;
that's
the
barrier
that
prevents
constitutionally
a
law
from
being
applied
to
groups
of
people.
in
sum,
it
is...
it
is
completely
constitutional
for
a
state
such
as
california
to
exercise
its
sovereign
right
to
limit
the...
a
businesslike
organization,
such
as
rotary
international,
and
indeed,
if
any
rotary
club
followed
the
rules
of...
a
local
rotary
club
as
well,
and
require
it,
as
a
businesslike
organization,
to
follow
the
california
statute.
the
deputy
attorney
general
from
the
state
of
california
will
discuss
more
of
the
california's
interest.
thank
you.
