justice
scalia
but
it
really
doesn't
involve
the
local
clubs,
does
it?
it...
it
involves
the
international
affiliation.
this
particular
local
club
wanted
to
admit
women?
justice
scalia
no,
no,
no,
it
doesn't
follow.
you
can
find
that
a
local
club
has
constitutional
protection
with
regard
to
its
local
association
of
the
46
members,
one
with
another,
without
necessarily
being
drawn
to
the
conclusion
that
it
has
constitutional
protection
with
regard
to
all
of
its
associations,
including
its
decision
to
affiliate
with
an
international
of,
what,
a
million...
a
million
people.
those
are
two
quite
different
questions,
aren't
they?
and
we
don't
have
to
answer
them
both
the
same
way.
justice
scalia
why...
now
you
say,
jurisdiction
over
the
international
is
only
achieved
through
the
local
club?
justice
scalia
yes,
but
you
may
be
mixing
up
the
statutory
and
the
constitutional
questions.
maybe
they
violate
the
unruh
act
by
what
they
do.
but
your
answer
would
be,
well,
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
associate,
so
the
unruh
act
cannot
prevent
them
from
making
them
that
decision.
and
it
may
well
be
the
international
violates
the
unruh
act
by
cancelling
their
franchises.
but
does
it
necessarily
follow
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
cancel
their
franchise?
it
seems
to
me
those
are
two
separate
questions.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
your
point.
they
have
a
constitutional
right
to
cancel
this
franchise
if
it
has
women
in
it.
justice
scalia
but
not
on
behalf
of
the
individual
members
of
the
duarte
club.
justice
scalia
california's
saying
sort
of
the
same
thing,
that
rotary
international
is
entitled
to
affiliate
only
with
organizations
that
don't
admit
women,
but
not
in
california.
justice
scalia
so
that,
you
know,
that's
fair
too.
justice
scalia
had
they
met
those
tests,
we
would
then
had
to
have
proceeded
to
see
whether
the
international
organization
or
the
interstate
organization
meets
that
test.
i
mean,
you're
right
that
that
one
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
local...
of
the
local
units.
but
it
could
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
the
local
units.
had
we
decided
there
with
respect
to
the
local
units
what
you
want
us
to
decide
here,
that
is,
that
the
local
units
themselves
are
insulated
against
this
kind
of
a
state
command,
we
would
then,
in
roberts,
have
had
to
proceeded
and
say,
well,
given
that,
what
about
the
whole
affiliated
organization?
why
isn't
that
the
case?
justice
scalia
that
is
a
question
of
california
law.
if
california
has
misinterpreted
its
statute
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
rotary
international
is
providing
goods
or
services,
i
mean,
that
may
be
a
very
foolish
interpretation
of
the
statute,
but
it
seems
to
me
that's
up
to
the
california
courts.
justice
scalia
likewise,
if
california
wants
to
say
that
the
furnishing
of
goods
and
services
by
a
local
club
under
its
statute
is
sufficient
to
attribute
the
sale
of
goods
and
services
to
the
international,
once
again,
that's
a
question
of
california
law.
it
seems
to
me
our
only
problem
is
whether
california
has
the
power
to
exclude
association
in
the
international
group,
regardless
of
how
they
get
there.
that's
the
only
federal
constitutional
result
that
we're
looking
at,
it
seems
to
me.
you
may
be
right
that
they
got
there
by
a
very...
very
devious
process.
but
that's--
justice
scalia
--and
it
is.
and
it
is,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law.
justice
scalia
but
the
only
constitutional
issue
we
have
before
us
is
that
not
that,
but
rather,
the
application
to
the
international.
so
that
may
be
quite
correct
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law,
and
that's
not
the
constitutional
issue.
yes,
but
what
if...
isn't
it
your
submission
that
the
local
club
could
not
constitutionally
be
required
to
comply
with
the
law?
justice
scalia
and
suppose
you
were
right.
suppose
you
were
right.
then
i
suppose
you
would
say
that...
then
the
case
is
over,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
"we"
being
the
individual
clubs.
justice
scalia
what
do
you
interpret
you
have
to
do
to
comply
with
the
court's
order
here?
could...
could
you
comply
with
the
order
by
simply
saying,
we
will
not
affiliate
with
any
chicago
clubs?
see,
i
have
some
problem
about
whether
california
can
dictate
its
policy
nationwide,
so
that
even
if
other
states
have
no
problems
with
mens-only
clubs,
those
clubs
in
other
states
cannot
join
rotary
international
as
an
all-male
group.
justice
scalia
so
you
have
to
make
them
affiliate
with
your
club
in
iowa,
assuming
iowa
has
no
law
like
this,
even
though
iowa
would
have
no
problem
about--
justice
scalia
ms.
resnik--
justice
scalia
--let
me
ask
you
this.
you
know,
there
are
obviously
various
important
interests
in
conflict
here.
one
is
the
interest
in
association.
california
has
come
to
the
judgment
that
its
interest
against
discrimination
against
women
overcomes
that.
that's
fine
for
california.
but
what
about
iowa
that
comes
to
a
different
conclusion,
and
they
say,
yes,
there
is
the
interest
against
discrimination,
but
there's
also...
people
ought
to
be
able
to
associate
with
whom
they
wish,
and
not
with
whom
they
don't
wish?
how
can
this
california
order
compel
a
nationwide
organization,
indeed,
an
international
organization
like
rotary...
rotary,
to
alter
its
character,
so
that
even
if
all
of
the
clubs
in
iowa
who
are
impeded
by
no
iowa
law,
and
all
of
the
clubs
in
let's
say
49
other
states
want
to
join
in
an
organization
that
is
male-only,
they
can't
do
so,
just
because
of
california
law?
justice
scalia
well,
then,
this
order
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
because
this
order
says
that
rotary
international
must
admit
this
club.
justice
scalia
unless
they
choose
to
withdraw.
justice
scalia
and
if
they
withdraw,
they
don't
have
to
worry
about
it.
justice
scalia
i'm
saying,
are
you
sure
that
this
doesn't
prevent
them
from
withdrawing?
justice
scalia
general
johnston,
can
you
tell
us
how
rotary
international
can
comply
with
this
court
order,
if
it
wishes,
in
those
states
that
do
not
feel
the
way
california
does,
to
continue
as
an
all-male
organization?
justice
scalia
but
you
are
affecting
states
other
than
california,
then.
because
if
you
apply
this
injunction,
literally,
it
means
that
even
though
rotary
clubs
in
all
the
49
other
states
that
don't
have
a
law
like
the
unruh
law,
assuming,
even
though
all
those
clubs
want
to
have
an
affiliation
in
an
all-male
national
organization,
california
alone
can
prevent
that.
justice
scalia
it's
not
just
the
clubs
operating
in
the
other
states.
it's
that
those
clubs
want
to
have
a
national
organization,
and
they
want
to
affiliate
with
one
another.
they
want
to
have
the
kind
of
visitation
privileges
that
rotary
international
provides.
if
you're
a
member
of
rotary,
you
can
go
into
any
club
in
that
town.
and
they
want
to
be
able
to
go
to
an
all-male
club.
justice
scalia
you
acknowledge,
then,
that
as
this...
that...
that
this
injunction
prevents
rotary
from
doing
that;
that
rotary
cannot
get
out
of
california
and
just
say,
we'll
operate
in
the
other
49
states?
justice
scalia
how
can
it
do
that?
i
thought
that
the
only
way
it
now
does
business
in
california
is
through
its
affiliates,
that
is,
the
local
rotary
clubs.
and
this
injunction
prevents
it
from
expelling
this
local
rotary
club.
justice
scalia
how
can
it
do
that
and
comply
with
this
injunction?
justice
scalia
and
doing
business
in
california
consists
of
no
more
than
having
a
local
rotary
club
in
california.
and
this
injunction
prevents
it
from
terminating
a
local
rotary
club
in
california.
justice
scalia
suppose...
how
can
they
withdraw
from...
can
they
withdraw
from
california
if
they
just
say,
we
will
no
longer
have
any
california
local
rotary
clubs?
can
they
do
that?
justice
scalia
and
that
would
comply
with
this
injunction?
justice
scalia
is
it
theoretically
possible
that
all
of
them
are
like
that?
just
sort
of
theoretically
possible--
justice
scalia
--that
all
of
them
are
like
that,
and
the
law
would
still
apply
to
the
international,
in
your
view.
