saying
that
this
club
could
not
be
compelled
to
admit
women.
justice
white
so
they
could
expel
women
or
keep
them
out
without
violating
the
law?
justice
white
and
you
say
international
could
insist
that
they
do
just
that?
justice
white
so
what's
your
argument,
that
the
local
club
doesn't
have
to
live
up
to
california
law?
justice
white
are
you
suggesting
that
even
if
duarte
would
not
violate
the
california
law
if
it
excluded
women,
that
when
it
does...
when
it
does
have
women
in
it
voluntarily,
rotary,
as
a
vast
international
organization,
may
not
exclude
it?
justice
white
well,
just
answer
my
question.
justice
white
even
if
the
local
could
legally
under
california
law
exclude
women?
justice
white
because
of
the
unruh
act?
justice
white
and
they
thought
that
would
be
constitutional,
also,
the
unruh
act
as
applied
to
this
club?
justice
white
so
you're
saying--
justice
white
--let's
assume
for
that
for
some
reason
or
another,
this
particular
local
duarte
club
was
not
subject
to
the
unruh.
justice
white
let's
assume
it
wasn't.
justice
white
just
assume
it
wasn't.
i
take
it
you
think
that's
immaterial,
that
it's
got
women
in
it,
and
if
the
international
club
expels
that
club
because
it's
got
women
in
it,
the
international
club
is
violating
your
act?
justice
white
well,
that's
what
they
did.
they
can't
withdraw
as
long
as
they
have
to
admit
this
club.
justice
white
and
wouldn't
you
say
that...
that
under
this
injunction,
or
one
that
would
undoubtedly
be
forthcoming,
that
rotary
international
could
not
exclude
women
delegates
who
are
members
of
local
california
rotary
clubs?
justice
white
so
they
would
have
to,
at
the
international
meeting,
unless
rotary
wanted
to
withdraw
entirely
from
california,
rotary
would
have
to
admit
the
california
lady
delegates
into
their
convention?
justice
white
suppose
one
of
these
clubs,
some
other
club
in
california,
refused
to
admit
women,
and
a
suit
was
brought,
and
it
was
held
that
the
club
had
to
admit
women,
under
unruh.
justice
white
is
it
possible
that
it
could
be
held
under
unruh
that
it
didn't
need
to
admit
women?
justice
white
but
there
isn't
any
rotary...
local
rotary
club
that
could
be
of
that
nature,
i
gather?
justice
white
even
if
one
of
them...
even
if
one
of
them...
even
if
one
of
them,
even
though
it
didn't
have
to,
admitted
women
voluntarily,
and
rotary
threw
them
out
for
it,
rotary
as
an
organization
nevertheless
could
not
do
that?
