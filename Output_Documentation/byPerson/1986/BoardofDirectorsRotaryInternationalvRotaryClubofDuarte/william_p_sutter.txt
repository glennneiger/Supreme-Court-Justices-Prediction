mr.
william
p.
sutter
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
has
postponed
consideration
of
jurisdiction
in
this
case
to
this
hearing,
so
i
will
briefly
talk
about
that
before
i
get
into
the
merits.
the
contention
is
made
by
the
appellees
that
the
constitutional
issue
was
not
properly
raised
in
the
courts
below.
and
that's
been
briefed
heavily
by
both
sides.
what
the
appellants
said
in
their
trial
brief,
and
what
was
dealt
with
by
the
court,
both
the
trial
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
california,
was
the
question
of
whether
application
of
the
unruh
act
to
rotary
would
violate
rotarians
constitutional
right
to
freedom
of
expression,
freedom
of
association.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
unruh
act
did
apply,
and
that
it
did
not
violate
the
first
amendment.
that,
i
submit,
makes
this
an
appealable
case.
i
refer
the
court
to
the
pruneyard
case,
decided
only
a
few
years
ago,
when
the
court
said,
and
i'm
quoting:
"the
california
supreme
court
rejected
appellant's
claim
that
recognition
of
such
a
right
violated
appellant's
right
to
exclude
others,
which
is
a
fundamental
component
of
their
federally
protected
property
rights.
"
"appeal
is
thus
the
proper
method
of
relief.
"
that
could
be
precisely
applied
to
this
case
if
you
changed
instead
of,
"which
is
a
fundamental
component
of
their
federally
protected
property
rights.
"
to
"their
federally
protected
first
amendment
rights.
"
in
either
case,
the
california
supreme
court
held
that
the
application
of
the
law
did
not
violate
their
constitutional
rights.
appeal,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
proper
procedure.
however,
if
it
isn't
the
proper
procedure,
it
is
of
course
within
the
power
of
this
court
to
treat
the
jurisdictional
statement
as
a
petition
for
certiorari,
and
to
grant
certiorari.
and
in
that
event,
i
would
hope
that
this
case,
which
has
attracted
nationwide
attention,
which
is
the
first
of
cases
arising
on
the
same
issue
in
six,
or
eight,
or
ten
other
jurisdictions,
all
involving
male-only
organizations,
such
as
the
kiwannis,
the
lions,
the
boy
scouts,
that
the
court
would
see
fit
to
take
this
case
on
certiorari,
if
it
isn't
a
direct
appeal,
and
utilize
this
opportunity
hopefully
to
re-express
its
devotion
and
adherence
to
the
first
amendment;
but
in
any
event,
to
put
to
rest
a
very
serious
question
involving
the
rights
of
male-only
or
sex-only...
there
are
female-only
organizations
as
well
that
are
interested,
and
they
filed
amicus
briefs
in
this
case...
their
rights
to
exclude
members
of
another
sex
from
what
might
be
termed
a
private
club,
a
social
organization,
or
a
service
club
as
in
the
case
of
rotary.
turning
to
the
merits,
the
case
involves
the
right
of
individual
rotarians,
joined
together
in
local
rotary
clubs,
which
are
social
clubs,
in
which
all
the
courts
have
found
that
fellowship,
camaraderie,
the
desire
to
do
good
for
society,
both
in
the
community
and
in
the
world
at
large,
are
predominant
motives
and
purposes.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
that
is...
this
particular
club
did,
your
honor.
but
i
think
it
inherently
must
involve
the
local
club.
the
court
of
appeals
felt
that
it
must
involve
the
local
club,
because
it
said
that
in
deciding
the
case
against
international,
it
must
look
at
and
decide
whether
the
local
club
was
itself
subject
to
the
unruh
act.
and
i
submit
that's
necessary
for
the
following
reasons.
if
a
local
rotary
club
is
regarded
as
a
truly
private
club,
and
if
it
is
the
decision
of
this
court
that
a
truly
private
club
is
not
subject
to
unruh
act
type...
because
of
its
first
amendment
intimate
or
expressive
associational
rights,
then
a
local
rotary
club
couldn't
be
found
to
violate
the
unruh
act.
what
has
happened
here
is
that
all
local
rotary
clubs,
which
have
voluntarily
adopted
the
rule
that
women
may
not
be
members,
have
joined
together
in
an
international
confederation
known
as
rotary
international.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
i
think
we
have
to
decide
what
the
unruh
act
applies
to.
and
the
california
court
of
appeal,
reading
the
unruh
act,
which
says
that
every
person
has
the
right
to
obtain
goods
and
advantages,
held
that
membership
in
the
local
club
was
a
good
or
an
advantage;
and
therefore,
it
was
subject
to
the
unruh
act.
now
it
can
only
reach
that
decision
if
the
local
club,
which
is
the
only
organization
which
makes
available
membership,
which
is
the
good
or
advantage
that
the
court
is
talking
about,
is
itself
subject
to
the
unruh
act.
now
if
the
club
is
not
subject
to
the
unruh
act,
then
i
submit
that
the
international,
which
does
not
do
business
in
california,
is
not
registered
there,
cannot
be
held
to
violate
the
unruh
act,
because
it
says
to
a
club
which
can
legally
discriminate
against
women,
we
want
you
to
legally
discriminate
against
women.
if
the
local
club
is
subject
to
the
unruh
act,
then
so
is
international
for
compelling
it
to
violate
that
act.
but
i
think
it
is
necessary,
it
is
essential,
to
the
decision
in
this
case
that
the
court
find
that
a
local
club
is
subject
to
the
unruh
act
and
that
the
members
don't
have
first
amendment
rights.
now
if
they
don't--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that
precisely.
i'm
saying
that
if
the
local
clubs...
every
local
club
in
california
is
entitled
to
exclude
women,
and
it's
only
the
local
club
that
women
or
anyone
else
can
belong
to,
because
there
are
no
individual
members
of
international,
if
it
is
only
the
local
club
to
which
they
can
belong,
and
if
each
of
those
clubs
independently
can
exclude
women,
then
the
fact
that
the
international
says,
great,
we
want
you
to
exclude
women;
you
must
exclude
women
if
you
are
to
call
yourself
rotary...
now
you
can
admit
women;
you
can
be
a
local
service
club;
you
can
do
any
of
those
things
on
your
own...
but
it
is
only
local
clubs
which
have
voluntarily
agreed
not
to
admit
women
that
can
call
themselves
rotary
because
they
have
made
that
agreement
among
themselves.
now,
i
don't
think
that
their
making
that
agreement
can
cause
the
international
to
be
violative
of
the
unruh
act
if
they
are
not
violative
of
the
unruh
act.
now
if
they
are,
then
it
is.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
i
don't
think
that
the
international
has
a
constitutional
right
of
association,
because
the--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--they're
asserting
this
right
on
behalf
of
the
individual
members
of
rotary,
your
honor,
really.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
no,
not
on
behalf
of
the
individual
members
of
the
duarte
club.
the
individual
members
of
the
duarte
club
are
entirely
free--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--individual
rotarians
in
individual
local
rotary
clubs.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
not
all
other
than
duarte.
the
san
francisco
club
has
admitted
women.
and
if
we
win
this
case,
presumably
the
san
francisco
club
will
either
have
to
expel
the
women
or,
we
believe,
be
removed
from
rotary.
no
local
club,
no
local
service
club,
is
compelled
to
admit
women,
or
exclude
women,
if
they
don't
want
to
be
a
member
of
rotary
international.
they
can
be
a
service
club,
rotary
duarte,
with
the
x
sign
that
they
have
painted,
continues
to
exist.
it
continues
to
do
good
work.
it
is
a
service
club,
and
it
admits
women.
that
is
a
laudable
result.
but
they
are
not
entitled
to
belong
to
an
association
of
clubs
which
have
concluded
not
to
admit
women.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
well,
that's--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--that
isn't
quite
fair.
well,
it
may
be
fair,
but
the
question
is,
is
it
constitutional.
everything
that
is
constitutional
is
not
fair,
and
everything
that
is
fair
is
not
constitutional,
i
submit.
if...
if
the
international
cannot
compel
a
club...
let's
take
a
club
other
than
duarte.
some
other
club
doesn't
admit
women.
doesn't
want
to
admit
women.
wants
to
adhere
to
the
compact
that
they
have
all
entered
into,
and
which
they
could
all
change
by
appropriate
vote,
which
but
which
have
refused
to
do
on
six
separate
and
distinct
occasions.
i
submit
that
this
case,
as
the
statute
of
california
was
construed
by
the
court
of
appeal...
now
the
statute
could
have
been
written
differently,
perhaps,
or
could
have
been
construed
differently.
but
the
court
of
appeal
felt
that
in
order
to
find
international
violative
of
the
statute,
it
had
also
to
find,
and
it
did
find,
duarte
violative
of
the
statute.
in
doing
that,
i
submit
that
it
found
that
all
california
clubs
would
violate
the
statute
if
they
didn't...
if
they
adhered
voluntarily
to
the
international
provision
that
they
must
exclude
women.
if
international
can't
enforce
it
against
duarte,
how
can
they
voluntarily
sustain
it
vis-a-vis
the
rotary
club
of
orange
county?
mr.
william
p.
sutter
yes.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
they
also
held
that
duarte
did,
or
they
also
held
that
duarte
was
subject
to
the
unruh
act
and
could
not
exclude
women.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
i
say
that
it
does...
that
the
right
of
the
international
turns
on
the
nature
of
the
california
clubs.
that's
all
i'm
saying.
if
the
california
clubs
themselves
have
the
right
to
violate
the
statute
because
they
aren't
subject
to
it,
then
international
has
a
right
to
violate
the
statute
because
it
is
a
compact
of
those
clubs.
it
has
no
separate
membership.
there's
no
statutory
right
of
anybody
to
belong
to
international.
the
statute
doesn't
address
the
subject
of
clubs
belonging
to
an
international
federation.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
it
has
held
that.
yes,
it
has
held
that.
but
i
say
that
it
has
held
that...
and
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
it
held
that...
based
on
the
character
of
the
local
club.
all
i'm
saying
is
that
the
character
of
the
local
club
is
integral
to
a
decision
as
to
the
international.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
i'm
attempting
to
frame
an
argument
on
behalf
of
the
members
of
the
local
clubs,
because
what
i
say
is
that
this
decision
inherently
carries
with
it...
it's
not
an
express
holding
in
this
case...
inherently
carries
with
it
the
decision
that
no
other
california
rotary
club
may
properly
exclude
women.
if
it
doesn't
hold
that,
or
if
that
isn't
inherent
in
it,
it
is
clearly
then
inherent
in,
by
overbreadth
argument,
which
i
didn't
want
to
come
to
here,
and
i
really
didn't
want
to
come
to
at
all
because
it's
a
latter
argument,
this
statute
then
is
so
broad
that
the
language
of
the
court
that
said
duarte
is
a
business,
that
duarte
may
not
exclude
women,
that
applies
under
the
unruh
act,
which
applies
to
all
arbitrary
acts,
to
all
arbitrary
discriminations.
and
every
other
club
in
california
is
going
to
think
that
it
applies
to
them.
the
right
of
free
expression
is
going
in
fact
to
be
chilled.
but
i
submit
that
that's
not
necessary
to
get
to
that
kind
of
a
point,
because
really,
the
california
court
of
appeals
said
that
in
looking
at
the
issue
of
international,
we
must
look
at
the
character
of
rotary...
i
mean
duarte
and
local
clubs;
it
didn't
say
just
duarte.
"and
local
clubs".
mr.
william
p.
sutter
what's
wrong
with
that?
mr.
william
p.
sutter
nothing.
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
local
clubs.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the
local
clubs,
and
then
find
out--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--no.
no,
that
is
not
all
right
with
me.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
no,
my
point
is
not
whether
all
california
clubs
should
admit
women
or
should
not,
clearly.
it
might
be
a
very
good
thing
if
they
all
did.
my
point
is
whether
the
duarte
case,
this
case,
and
the
california
court
of
appeals
decision,
compels
them
to
admit
women.
under
the
unruh
act,
applying
the
unruh
act,
it
is
my
contention
that
they
must
admit
women.
but
it
is
also
my
contention
that
applying
the
unruh
act
to
the
local
california
clubs
would
be
violative
of
their
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
this
case
was
voluntary.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
the
roberts
case,
which
is
the
case
that
everybody
talks
about
as
either
being
controlling
on
the
law
or
controlling
on
the
facts...
we
say
it's
controlling
on
our
side
because
of
the
law;
appellees
say
it's
controlling
because
they
think
the
facts
are
the
same.
that
was
the
jaycees'
case
decided
only
a
few
years
ago.
what's
involved
in
exactly
the
same
posture
as
this
case,
in
that
case
a
minnesota
jaycees
organization
admitted
women.
the
international
said
it
had
to
throw
them
out
or
be
thrown
out
of
jaycees
itself.
that
case
went
back
and
forth.
ultimately
the
eighth
circuit
held
that,
no,
they
did
not
have
to
throw
them
out,
because
of
the
first
amendment
associational
rights,
not
of
jaycees
international,
but
because
of
the
first
amendment
associational
rights
of
the
members
of
the
jaycees.
that
was
reversed
by
this
court.
it
was
not
reversed
because
this
court
said
or
the
minnesota
supreme
court
said,
we're
only
looking
at
jaycees
international;
we
don't
have
to
worry
about
that.
they
said,
we're
reversing
this
decision
because
the
jaycees
don't
meet
the
tests,
the
local
jaycees
don't
meet
the
test,
for
first
amendment
rights.
they
are
large
clubs.
they
are
unselective
clubs.
they
admit
women
as
associate
members.
they
do
all
of
these
things,
none
of
which--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--well,
your
honor,
every
case
that
there
is,
that
i'm
aware
of,
pending
or
past,
has
involved
this
type
of
situation
where
an
organization,
a
dissident
group,
a
dissident
member
of
the
organization
has
concluded
to
admit
women,
and
then
the
organization
has
attempted
to
enforce
the
compact.
and
why
is
that?
because
if
a
local
club,
which
has
discretion
as
to
whom
to
admit,
and
which
has
selective
grounds
for
admission,
votes
a
woman
down,
how
can
she
sue
and
demonstrate
that
she
was
excluded
because
she
was
a
woman?
that's
the
only
case
that
could
bring
directly
the
right
of
the
local
club
into
issue.
there
are
none
of
those
cases
around
the
country.
the
cases
around
the
country
are
all
cases
where
the
local
club,
kiwannis
or
somebody,
did
admit
a
woman,
and
the
enforcement
of
the
aggregation's
rules,
the
association's
rules,
has
then
caused
that
club
to
be
either
suspended
or
to
have
to
remove
the
woman
from
membership.
and
i
submit
that
in
every
one
of
those
cases,
the
issue
is,
is
the
enforcement
of
the
rule
adopted
by
an
aggregation
of
local
clubs,
is
that
enforcement
legal?
and
the
question
of
whether
it
is
legal
turns
on
whether
the
local
clubs
actually
have
the
right
by
themselves
to
make
such
a
rule,
and
then
to
band
together
and
say,
all
of
us
are
going
to
abide
by
the
same
rule.
at
that
point,
it
turns
into
a
trademark,
service
mark,
type
of
case.
the
recent
kiwannis
case
in
the
third
circuit
which
has
gone
back...
well,
it's
on
motion
for
rehearing
in
the
third
circuit,
but
which
was
sent
back
to
the
district
court...
didn't
get
to
the
constitutional
issue
because
the
third
circuit
concluded,
contrary
to
the
federal
district
court,
that
the
new
jersey
statute
simply
didn't
apply
to
things
like
kiwannis.
but
in
deciding
that,
it
did
not
look
at
the
international.
it
looked,
as
it
properly
had
to,
at
the
local
club.
again,
what
are
the
attributes
of
the
local
club?
does
it
qualify
as
a
private
club?
if
it
does,
then
this
suit,
which
was
against
international,
is
gone.
they
didn't
look
at
the
attributes
of
the
international
to
decide
that
the
suit
was
gone;
they
looked
at
the
attributes
of
the
local
club
to
decide
that
the
suit
was
gone.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
yes,
but
i
think
the
same...
the
same
result
applies
whether
you're
construing
the
statute
or
the
constitution.
it
is
the
rights
of
the
application
to
the
local
group
that
has
to
determine
whether
there
is
or
is
not
a
public
accommodations
law
which
has
been
violated
in
the
first
place;
and
secondly,
if
the
law
has
been
violated,
whether
that
violates
in
turn
the
rights
of
the
members
of
the
association,
because
those
are
the
only
people
who
are
affected.
there
aren't
any
members,
again--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--they
didn't,
actually.
they
determined
that
the
local
club
was
furnishing
the
goods
and
services.
they
held
that
membership
was
the
goods
and
services.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
i
don't
think
they
got
there
that
way.
i
think
they
got
there
the
way
i'm
saying
they
had
to
get
there.
i
think
they
got
there
because
they
held
that
the
local
club
was
itself
subject
to
the
unruh
act.
if
they
hadn't
held
that,
i
do
not
think
they
would
have
gotten
there.
and
if
they
hadn't
gotten
there,
we
wouldn't
have
this
case.
but
we
did
get...
they
did
get
there.
i
submit
that
they
got
there
because
they
said
the
local
club
was
subject
to
the
unruh
act,
and
that
it
didn't
have
first
amendment
rights.
or
they
didn't
maybe
come
to
that,
but
they
said
it
was
subject
to
it.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
and
it
is,
as
a
matter
of
statutory
law.
we
can't
quarrel
with
the
california
construction
of
the
facts,
that's--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
my
view
is
that
if
the
local
club
cannot
constitutionally
be
compelled
to
comply
with
the
unruh
act,
then
international
cannot
be
compelled
not
to
enforce
its
provision,
which
permits
the
local
club
to
do
just
that
very
thing,
or
which
requires
the
local
club
to
do
that
very
thing.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
it
was
found
to
be
subject
to
the
unruh
act.
and
i
submit
that
it
had
to
be
found
subject
to
the
unruh
act.
they
found
it
didn't
violate
it,
of
course,
because
it
let
women
in.
but
they
found
that
it
was
subject
to
the
act.
that
was
a
necessary
predicate
to
their
finding
that
the
international
was
subject
to
the
unruh
act
and
violated
it,
because
the
international
was
telling
a
club
which
couldn't
discriminate
against
women,
because
it
violated...
because
it
was
subject
to
the
unruh
act,
it
couldn't
tell
that
club,
you
must
discriminate.
because
that
would
be
compelling
the
local
club
to
violate
the
law.
and
that
was
the
violation
of
which
international
was
guilty.
now
if
telling
that
club
to
comply
with
the
law
would
not
be
a
violation
on
the
part
of
international.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
no,
your
honor,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
to
show
that.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
no,
i
don't
believe
that's
what
i'm
saying.
i'm
saying
that...
i'm
saying
that
there's
no...
compelling
a
person
to
do
something
lawful
is
not
itself
unlawful.
and--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--because
of
the
great
difference
between
rotary
clubs
and
jaycees
organizations,
yes.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
that
is
correct.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
as
long
as
that's
lawful
for
them
to
do,
international
could
insist
that
they
do
it
without
international's
violating
the
law.
and
if
international
can't
enforce
that,
that
to
me
is
saying
that
they
can't
do
it,
and
that
is
the
constitutional
right
of
the
members
that
i'm
complaining
about.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
well,
i
submit
that's
based
on
a
great
number
of
facts
which
distinguish
this
case
from
the
jaycees
case.
a.,
we
have
selectivity
in
membership.
b.,
it
is
a
fellowship
organization.
it
does
not...
and
there
was
no
finding
by
either
the
trial
court
or
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
was
any
sale
of
memberships
or
any
sale
of
goods
and
services
to
the
general
public.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
the
court
of
appeal
held
that
even
its
decision
didn't
require
rotary
clubs
to
open
their
membership
to
the
general
public.
so
it's
a
quite
different
factual
situation
in
that
regard
from
the
jaycees
case
where
memberships
were
sold,
and
the
membership
was
a
product
or
a
service,
because
the
membership
was
for
the
sole
purpose
of
becoming
a
member
of
an
organization
which
was
the
advancement
of
its
members.
that
was
sold
widely
without
selectivity.
advertisements
were
made
for
membership.
and
the
only
people
who
couldn't
just
step
up
and
buy
one
for
a
buck,
or
whatever
the
price
was,
were
women.
in
our
case,
you
must
be
proposed
for
membership.
there's
an
elaborate
membership
admissions
policy,
followed
by
virtually
all
clubs
the
testimony
will
indicate.
and
we
are
like
the
indian
hill
club
or
the
jonesboro
athletic
club
or
whatever
it
might
be.
now
it
may
be--
mr.
william
p.
sutter
--"we"
meaning
the
individual
rotary
club.
it
may
be
that
california
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
avoiding
or
eliminating
sex
discrimination.
i
don't
question
that
there's
a
legitimate
interest
there.
i
simply
say
that
it
is
not
a
compelling
interest
if
we
don't
have
this
public
service...
sale
of
service
to
the
public
aspect.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
i
interpret
the
court's
order
here
as
saying
we
can't
throw
the
duarte
club
out;
we
have
to
give
them
their
charter
back.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
an
absolutely
necessary
flowage
from
that
that
we
can't
compel
them
to
call
themselves
the
sort-of
rotary
club
of
duarte,
or
the
women-admitting
rotary
club
of
duarte;
that
they
have
to
be
a
full
rotary
club.
mr.
william
p.
sutter
about
having
men-only
clubs?
yes,
i
think
we
have
to
do
that.
more
than
that,
i
think
if
the
orange
county
club
in
california,
if
we
say,
you,
orange
county
club,
you
don't
have
any
women
now.
don't
let
them
in.
i
submit
that
that
is
violative
of
the
law.
but
i
don't
think
it
should
be
violative
of
the
law,
if
the
orange
county
club
doesn't
want
to
have
women
and
isn't
violating
the
law
by
not
having.
and
that,
i
think,
is
the
crux
of
this
case.
i
think
this
case
is
not
restricted
to
duarte.
i
think
it
compels
rotary
international
to
permit
each
and
every
club
in
california
to
admit
women;
and
if
any
club
in
california
chooses
not
to
admit
women,
i
think
that
club
is
in
violation
of
the
unruh
act,
because
the
local
club
has
been
held
to
be
subject
to
the
unruh
act,
and
this
court
says...
this
case
says
that
if
you're
subject
to
it,
keeping
women
out
violates
it.
now,
i
don't
know
whether
keeping
women
out
necessarily
violates
it.
california
says
that...
my
time
is
up.
