the
only
federal
question
in
this
case
is
whether
there
is
any
provision
in
the
united
states
constitution
that
forbids
california,
acting
in
its
sovereign
power
to
protect
the
welfare
of
its
people,
from
forbidding
the
type
of
sex
discrimination--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--the
complaint
was
filed
by
rotary
club
of
duarte
against
rotary
international,
alleging
that
rotary
international
violated
the
unruh
civil
rights
act.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
no,
your
honor.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
only
to
the
extent
that
it
found
that
the
application
of
unruh
to
rotary
international
was
not
unconstitutional.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
no,
it
concluded
quite
the
contrary
that
applying
unruh
to
rotary
international
did
not
violate
any
constitutional
rights.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
only
that
the
application
was
not
unconstitutional.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
i
believe
it
did
refer
to
the
fact
that
there
were
no
violations
either
of
the
rights
of
intimate
association
or
expressive
association.
and
as
this
court
has
reminded
us
on
numerous
occasions,
there
may
be
a
desire
to
discriminate
by
many
groups,
but
invidious
private
discrimination
has
never
been
accorded
affirmative
constitutional
protection.
and
without
having
some
specific
federal
prohibition
on
what
california
has
done,
then
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
california
is
committed
to
the
eradication
of
sex
discrimination.
and
this
commitment
is
equal
to
its
commitment
to
eliminating
race
discrimination,
not
just
in
the
unruh
civil
rights
act,
but
as
a
constitutional
matter,
in
the
other
civil
rights
statutes,
and
in
california's
common
law
history,
race
and
sex
discrimination
are
equally
invidious.
and
i
think
it's
undisputed
that
being
able
to
call
oneself
a
rotarian
is
valuable.
it's
valuable
in
the
business
community.
rotary
is
respected
as
being
a
cross-section
of
the
business
community.
and
it's
true--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--i
would
certainly
agree
with
counsel
for
duarte
that
the
state
of
california
has
no
intent
to
try
and
enforce
its
law
outside
the
state
of
california.
all
that
we
are
requiring
is
that
rotary
international
not
expel
local
clubs
such
as
duarte
who
choose
to
admit
women.
if
they
are
expelled,
then
they
no
longer
enjoy
the
advantage
of
being
able
to
identify
themselves--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--we
are
not
preventing
those
clubs
operating
in
other
states,
if
that
is
not
unlawful
in
those
other
states.
not
it
may
affect
those
other
states--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--well,
in
that
sense,
your
honor,
it's
no
different
than
saying
that
rotary
international
doesn't
discriminate
on
the
basis
of
race,
even
though
it's
operating
in
communities
where
race
discrimination
may
be
permitted.
rotary--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--oh,
no,
it
could
certainly
leave
california,
if
it
is
no
longer
a
business
establishment
operating
in
california,
then
it
wouldn't
be
subject
to
california's
law.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
and
i
assume
that
rotary
would
not
want
to
leave
california
because
of
the
number
of
members
that
it
has.
but
it
certainly
could
decide
it
is
no
longer
going
to
charter
or
recognizes
clubs
in
california.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
i
don't
think
this
injunction
provides
anything
further
than,
if
it
is
in
the
business,
doing
business
in
california,
that
it
has
to
do
so
in
a
nondiscriminatory
manner.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
that's
true.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
that's
correct.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
they
would
certainly
have
to
treat
women
rotarians
from
california
the
same
as
they
treat
men
rotarians
from
california.
that's
the
purpose
of
the
unruh
civil
rights
act.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
they
can
do
that,
your
honor.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
that
would
comply
with
the
california
law,
because
they
would
no
longer
be
operating
in
california,
so
they
wouldn't
be
violating
california
law.
but
california's
message
which
it
gives
to
business
establishments
in
california
is
that
you
do
have
to
treat
women
as
equals,
and
you
cannot
treat
them
as
second
class
citizens.
turning
to
the
overbreadth
issue
which
counsel
for
rotary
international
alluded
to;
it
is
true
that
the
unruh
civil
rights
act
is
broad.
it
was
deliberately
broad.
california
formerly
had
a
statute
similar
to
that
in
many
other
states,
which
referred
to
places
of
public
accommodation.
it
decided
that
that
language
was
too
narrow,
and
that
there
were
too
many
groups
being
excluded
from
coverage
that
california
wished
to
prevent
from
discriminating.
so
it
decided
to
enact
a
statute
which
used
very
broad
language.
it
used
language
of
"all",
of
every
kind
whatsoever,
to
signify
its
intent
to
prohibit
a
broad
range
of
discrimination.
but
the
fact
that
it's
broad
does
not
mean
that
it's
unconstitutionally
overbroad,
because
there
is
no
substantial
danger
that
the
unruh
civil
rights
act
will
be
misapplied
to
intrude
upon
constitutionally
protected
activities.
now
two
possible
areas
have
been
raised,
either
dealing
with
intimate
association
rights
or
expressive
rights.
any
time
there
has
been
any
hint
that
unruh
might
be
misapplied
to
those
types
of
situations,
california
courts
have
made
it
very
clear
that
they
will
not
permit
that
to
happen.
in
the
case
dealing
with
the
christian
yellow
pages,
where
a
sales
director
was
selling
solicitation
ads,
it
said,
although
we
will
regulate
your
discriminatory
business
practices,
we
will
not
regulate
your
first
amendment
rights,
your
expressive
rights.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
not
under
unruh.
it's
possible
that
there
would
be
constitutional
problems
which
would
prevent
unruh
from
being
applied.
california
courts
have
made
it
very
clear,
using
language
very
similar
to
this
court's
language
in
the
jaycees
case,
that
unruh
does
not
govern
truly
private
groups;
groups
that
are
purely
social,
continuous,
and
personal;
groups
that
operate
outside
of
public
view.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
i
don't
believe
so,
if
it
were
operating
as
rotary
international
tells
us
that
rotary
local
clubs
are
supposed
to
operate.
it's
conceivable
that
there
is
a
group
somewhere
calling
itself
rotary
that
would
fall
within
the
constitutionally
protected
zone
of
privacy.
and
if
that's
true,
they
would
certainly
be
both
protected
as
a
constitutional
matter,
but
also,
i
believe
that
the
california
courts
would
find
that
they
are
not
covered
by
the
unruh
civil
rights
act.
because
again,
the
california
courts
have
construed
unruh
not
to
cover
truly
private
clubs.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
it's
certainly
theoretically
possible
that
there
are
rotary...
groups
calling
themselves
rotary
that
are
constitutionally
protected.
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
and
there
clearly
are
many
associations
which
are
constitutionally
protected.
i
just
doubt
whether--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--theoretically
possible--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--that's
correct,
because
unruh
requires--
ms.
marian
m.
johnston
--because
it
is
depriving
women
of
the
opportunity
to
call
themselves
rotarians,
and
denying
them
all
the
benefits
that
that
engenders.
in
sum,
california
prohibits
only
arbitrary
and
invidious
discrimination.
it
does
not
prevent
selectivity
which
is
legitimate
in
terms
of
a
group's
purposes;
it
does
not
prohibit
all
invidious
discrimination
if
a
substantial
justification
can
be
shown;
and
it
doesn't
cover
groups
protected
by
any
intimate
association
rights.
but
since
the
unruh
civil
rights
act,
as
interpreted
and
as
applied
by
the
california
courts,
does
not
intrude
upon
any
federally
constitutionally
protected
rights,
then
i
think
the
sovereign
power
of
the
state
to
enact
legislation
and
to
apply
that
legislation
for
the
public
welfare
of
the
citizens
of
that
state
should
be
upheld,
and
the
decision
below
should
be
affirmed.
