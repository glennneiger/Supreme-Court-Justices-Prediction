whose
freedom
of...
whose
constitutional
right
to
associate
together
is
it
that
you
say
protects
the
international's
right
to
cancel
this
franchise?
justice
stevens
all,
other
than
duarte?
justice
stevens
but
mr.
sutter,
maybe
that's
correct
as
a
matter
of
logic,
but
i'm
not
sure
that's
this
case.
because
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
the
california
courts
held
that
the
international
violated
the
california
statute.
what
they
did
was
a
statutory
violation.
justice
stevens
and
you're
arguing--
justice
stevens
--well,
that
may
be,
but
that's
dicta,
because
they're
not
excluding
women.
that's
not
this
case,
because
they
voluntarily
admitted
women.
what
they
held
was
a
violation
of
the
statute,
as
i
understand,
insofar
as
the
judgment
has
any
effect,
is
what
the
international
did.
it
seems
to
me
you
have
to
be
able
to
argue
that
the
international
had
a
constitutional
right
to
violate
the
california
statute
in
the
way
that
it
did.
justice
stevens
well,
yes
it
does,
because
california
has
held
it
does.
i
mean,
maybe
it
doesn't
on
its
face
as
you
read
it,
but
it
has
held
that
the
international
does
not
have
the
right
to
expel
this
particular
club.
justice
stevens
but
that
was
in
construing
the
statute.
justice
stevens
but
therefore,
are
you
saying
at
least
it's
theoretically
possible...
i
suppose
you
would
argue
the
contrary...
that
the
international
rotary
is
a
business
organization
covered
by
the
statute
even
though
the
local
might
be
constitutionally
protected?
justice
stevens
that
are
associations
that
could
elect
to
restrict
their
membership.
