justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question
on
standing,
mr.
ayer.
does
he
allege
at
any
time
that
the
statute
adversely
affects
the
number
of
people
who
will
see
the
films
that
he
wants
to
exhibit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
all
they're
really
complaining
about
is
the
reputational
harm?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
ayer,
i
think
that
goes
to
the
merits
rather
than
the
standing
question.
confining
it
for
the
moment
to
the
standing
issue,
supposing
they
use
the
word
obscenity
or
obscene
or
pornographic
or
something
like
that
to
classify
a
certain
category
of
motion
picture,
and
it
was
an
overly
broad
description,
it
covered
wearing
your
shirt
sleeves
or
something
like
that.
could
an
exhibitor
object
to
that
on
the
ground
that
it
adversely
affected
his
reputation
to
be
described
as
a
person
showing
obscene
films
when
he
didn't
think
they
really
were
obscene?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
comes
in
and
alleges,
a
lot
of
people
say
you're
a
bad
man
because
you
show
obscene
films.
he
makes
sort
of
a
general
affidavit
that
it
harms
his
ability
to
get
elected
to
be
a
state
senator,
the
same
sort
of
affidavit
you
have
here,
in
other
words.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whether
he's
have
standing
to
object
to
that
kind
of
a
definition
in
a
federal
statute.
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
other
words,
it
seems
to
me
that
whether
the
definition
is
a
good
one
or
not
goes
to...
you
say
that
determines
the
standing
as
well
as
the
merits?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
in
my
obscenity
example
it
would
depend
on
how
good,
how
accurate
the
definition
was?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
alleges
in
his
complaint
that
the
definition
is
an
inaccurate
one,
as
i
guess
this...
here
he
concedes
that
the
definition
of
"propaganda"
is
a
neutral
definition,
does
he?
the
judge
found
that,
i
know,
but
did
the
plaintiff
also
concede
that?
he
doesn't
object
to
the
definition
of
"propaganda"?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
in
my
hypothetical
he's
challenging
the
accuracy
of
the
definition
of
obscenity
and
he
also
says
that
it
harms
his
reputation
because
he
wants
to
show
some
films
that
would
fit
within
the
definition.
you'd
say
that
he'd
have
no
standing
to
object?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
even
if
it
can't,
that
again
would
be
a
merits
answer,
wouldn't
it?
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
no
one
would
ever
have
standing
to
challenge
it?
it
may
be
that
the
government
has
an
absolute
right
to
say
what
it
wants
to,
but
are
you
suggesting
that
no
matter
how
harmful
the
speech
might
be,
calling
a
person
vile
names
and
all,
that
there
would
be
no
standing
to
challenge
that?
that's
pretty
extreme.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i'm
only
inquiring
about
the
standing
at
this
point.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
could
change
the
hypothetical
to
say
it
is
a
general
regulation
of
obscene
materials,
and
they
have
one
chapter
in
the
statute
that
does
just
like...
that's
a
counterpart
to
this
one
on
progapanda.
i
don't
see
that
that
really
changes
the
analysis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
this
case
involves
the
constituniality
of
a
provision
in
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
of
1938.
the
statute
requires
all
agents
of
foreign
principals
to
file
detailed
registration
statements,
describing
the
nature
of
their
business
and
their
political
activities.
the
requirement
applies
to
agents
of
both
friendly
and
unfriendly
governments.
pursuant
to
this
requirement
the
new
york
office
of
the
national
film
board
of
canada
has
been
registered
as
a
foreign
agent
since
1947,
because
it
is
an
agency
of
the
canadian
government.
films
produced
by
the
canadian
film
board
are
classified
under
that
statute
as
political
propaganda
if
they
contain
material
intended
to
influence
the
foreign
policies
of
the
united
states.
when
a
foreign
agent
distributes
such
materials
in
interstate
commerce
in
the
united
states
here
she
is
required
to
provide
the
attorney
general
with
a
copy
of
the
material
and
to
file
a
report
describing
the
extent
of
the
dissemination.
in
addition,
the
agent
must
provide
the
recipient
of
the
material
with
the
disclosure
statement
identifying
the
source
of
the
film
and
the
fact
that
a
copy
has
been
filed
with
the
attorney
general.
the
member
of
the
california
state
legislature
who
wanted
to
exhibit
three
canadian
films,
two
of
which
deal
with
the
subject
of
acid
rain
and
the
third
dealing
with
the
nuclear
war,
challenged
the
application
of
the
statute
to
these
three
films.
the
challenge
in
the
district
court
did
not
attack
the
provisions
of
the
act
concerning
disclosure,
registration,
and
filing.
it
concerned
the
provision
of
the
act
that
defines
the
regulated
category
by
using
the
term
propaganda
to
describe
the
materials
it
must
comply
with
these
various
provisions
of
the
statute.
the
district
court
held
that
the
california
legislator
had
standing
to
bring
the
action
and
that
invalidated
that
provision
of
the
statute.
we
noted
probable
jurisdiction.
as
a
case
comes
to
us,
it
does
not
raise
any
question,
concerning
the
registration,
disclosure,
and
filing
requirements
of
the
act.
we
agree
with
the
district
court
that
the
legislator
had
the
standing
to
bring
the
action,
but
we
reverse
the
decision
in
so
far
as
the
court
concluded,
that
it
was
unconstitutional
for
congress
to
use
the
term
"propaganda"
to
define
the
category
of
regulated
materials.
since
the
statute
neither
interferes
with
the
appellee's
access
to
the
films
nor
prohibits
edits
or
restrains
the
distribution
materials
to
which
the
term
political
propaganda
applies,
but
merely
requires
the
distributors
of
the
material
to
make
additional
disclosures
to
better
enable
the
public
to
evaluate
the
material,
we
find
no
violation
of
the
first
amendment.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
brennan
and
justice
marshall
have
joined.
justice
scalia
took
no
part
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
