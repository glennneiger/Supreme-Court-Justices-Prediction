mr.
donald
b.
ayer
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
the
power
of
federal
courts
to
edit
an
act
of
congress
at
the
behest
of
one
who
is
not
directly
restricted
or
obligated
under
the
statute,
but
who
rather
quarrels
with
the
indirect
impact
of
the
particular
words
that
congress
has
chosen.
the
appellee
is
a
california
state
senator
who
brought
suit
in
1983
to
enjoin
the
application
of
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
to
three
films
distributed
by
the
national
film
board
of
canada.
he
said
that
he
was
deterred
from
showing
publicly
those
films
by
the
act's
use
of
the
term
"political
propaganda"
to
apply
to
the
material
as
to
which
the
act
imposes
labeling
and
reporting
requirements.
the
foreign
agents
registration
act
as
enacted
in
1938
and
amended
several
times
since
then
sets
up
a
scheme
of
registration
and
reporting
by
agents
of
foreign
principals.
the
agents
under
the
act
are
required
to
first
register
and
provide
information
concerning
themselves
and
concerning
their
foreign
principals,
also
to
provide
information
in
separate
reports
about
the
dissemination
of
political
advocacy
material,
which
is
referred
to
under
the
statute
by
the
term
"political
propaganda".
finally,
the
agents
are
required
to
label
any
such
political
propaganda
or
foreign
political
advocacy
material
as
defined
in
the
statute
with
a
label
setting
forth
certain
information,
including
their
identities
and
the
identities
of
their
procedure
principals
and
a
number
of
other
matters
as
well.
the
label
itself
which
is
required
to
be
attached
to
the
material
does
not
use
the
words
"political
propaganda".
the
district
court
in
this
case
noted
in
its
rather
lengthy
opinion
that
the
definition
of
"political
propaganda"
as
set
forth
in
the
statute
is
in
fact
neutral
and
in
no
way
carries
negative
connotations.
notwithstanding
that
and
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
this
statute
by
its
direct
requirements
and
restrictions
in
no
way
touches
upon
this
defendant,
who
is
not
a
foreign
agent,
who
is
not
an
agent
of
a
foreign
principal,
who
is
not
a
foreign
principal,
and
who
is
not
required
to
file
any
report
under
the
statute,
and
indeed
is
not
even
barred
from
removing
or
omitting
to
show
a
label
attached
to
any
material
which
he
does
have
which
comes
within
the
statute,
the
district
court
nonetheless
found:
first,
that
the
appellee
had
standing,
on
the
ground
that
he
was
a
person
whose
reputation
would
be
impaired
by
association
with
material
that
had
been
classified
as
political
propaganda;--
and
secondly,
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
found
that
the
negative
impact
on
the
reputation
of
anyone
associated
with
the
material
was
such
as
to
amount
to
a
first
amendment
violation;
and
indeed,
went
on
to
say
that
congress
in
enacting
the
statute
deliberately
set
forth
to
suppress
speech,
that
is
the
category
of
speech
covered
by
the
terms
"political
propaganda".
and
on
that
basis
the
district
court
enjoined
the
enforcement
of
four
sections
of
the
statute
which
apply
with
reference
to
political
propaganda.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
they're
section
611(j),
which
is
the
definition
of
614(a),
(b),
and
(c),
which
pertain
to
the
dissemination
report
requirements
and
the
labeling
requirements.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct.
that's
section
(c).
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
believe
that's
section
(c),
your
honor,
and
that
is
correct,
yes.
we
think
that
the
character
of
the
challenge
which
was
brought
here...
that
is,
a
challenge
to
terminology
rather
than
a
challenge
to
the
substantive
requirements
of
the
statute...
is
very
important
to
both
the
standing
and
merits
issues
that
are
presented.
because
it
is
that
sort
of
narrow
challenge
to
the
precise
use
of
words
by
congress,
any
analysis
both
for
standing
purposes
and
for
merits
purposes
must
go
forward
with
the
idea
in
mind
that
the
substantive
scheme,
leaving
aside
the
words
"political
propaganda",
is
itself
valid.
it
has
not
been
challenged.
it
has
not
been
challenged
here
and
it's
not
been
questioned
seriously
before.
so
that
in
determining
what
effect
the
words
have,
the
words
"political
propaganda",
we
must
keep
in
mind
that
we
have
in
effect
a
registration
requirement
for
foreign
agents,
an
updating
requirement
as
to
that
registration
requirement.
a
great
deal
of
material
is
required
by
those
requirements:
the
singling
out
of
political
advocacy
material
by
whatever
definition
or
set
of
words
one
wants
to
describe
it,
nonetheless
the
same
mechanism
is
in
place
by
different
words,
if
not
by
the
words
4
of
our
brief
and
the
filing
of
dissemination
reports
with
regard
to
the
material
that
is
defined
as
political
propaganda,
or
by
whatever
term
you
would
use.
so
that
what
is
at
issue
here
is
not
the
power
of
the
congress
or
the
government
to
in
the
abstract
single
out
certain
material
and
simply
refer
to
it
by
the
words
"political
propaganda".
it
is
rather
whether
congress
can
use
the
words
"political
propaganda"
as
an
internal
legislative
classification
device,
defined
in
the
statute
in
a
non-pejorative
way
consistent
with
at
least
one
meaning,
one
common
usage
meaning
of
the
word
"propaganda",
and
in
a
statute
whose
clear
purpose
is
to
disclose
and
to
require
disclosure
of
information,
rather
than
to
suppress
or
in
any
way
restrict
the
flow
of
material.
we
think
the
narrow
character
of
that
challenge
is
relevant,
first
of
all,
on
the
question
of
standing.
just
as
the
appellee
here
had
no
standing,
i
think,
clearly
to
challenge
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
statute,
because
he
is
not
affected
by
them
in
any
way,
we
think
that
he
had
no
standing
to
nitpick
about
the
particular
terminology
that
congress
chose
to
use.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
when
one
looks
at
the
declarations
that
were
filed
in
this
case,
declarations
in
particular
by
mr.
bistrin
and
mr.
freed
and
mr.
peterson,
at
least
two
of
those,
bistrin
and
peterson,
deal
with
the
re-election
campaign
problem.
i
think
what
one
sees
is
a
primary
concern
with
resentments
in
the
district
toward
foreign
influences,
particularly
foreign
competition.
there's
discussion
about
a
high
unemployment
rate,
people
are
anxious
and
concerned
about
anybody
who
would
be
involved
with--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
in
a
sense
yes,
your
honor.
but
what
is
important
is
that
those
consequences
must
be
measured.
what
you
must
be
measuring,
since
the
challenge
is
only
to
the
words
"political
propaganda",
we
must
be
looking
at
how
the
words
"political
propaganda"
make
more
severe
or
distinct
or
aggravate
a
harm
which
i
think
is
clearly
implicit
to
some
degree
in
the
statute
itself.
we're
talking
about
a
statute
that
registers
and
discloses
information
about
foreign...
dissemination
of
foreign
information.
and
what
we're
having
to
analyze
here
for
standing
purposes
is
the
incremental
harm,
if
any,
that
results
within
that
statute
from
the
particular
selection
of
the
words
"political
propaganda".
and
my
point
in
looking
at
these
affidavits
is
that
the
resentments
to
foreign
competition,
the
anxiety
or
concern
that
would
be
expressed
by
the
people
on
what
they
describe
as
large
naval
and
military
bases
within
the
district
toward
foreign
sources,
those
kinds
of
concerns
are
not
alleviated
significantly
by
changing
the
words
"political
propaganda"
to
something
else.
taking
the
conventional
approach
of
analyzing
standing
in
terms
of
the--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--no,
he
does
not.
in
fact,
i
think
in,
i
think
it's
footnote
14
of
their
brief,
they
specifically
indicate
that
they
do
not
make
that
allegation.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
that's
correct,
yes.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
certainly
as
the
case
ended
up
before
the
district
court
at
the
cross-motions
for
summary
judgment,
it
is
completely
clear
from
both
the
words
of
the
appellee's
attorney
and
from
the
words
of
the
district
court
that
the
only
issue
is
the
use
of
the
words
"political
propaganda".
now,
we
don't
think,
therefore,
that...
for
the
reasons
that
i
gave
in
answer
to
justice
o'connor,
we
don't
think
that
a
distinct
and
palpable
injury
can
be
said
to
be
fairly
traceable
to
the
words,
as
distinct
from
the
requirements
of
the
statute.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
a
couple
of
points
on
that.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
at
one
point
in
the
case
an
effort
was
made
to
complain
about
that.
the
district
court
found
at
the
initial
preliminary
injunction
hearing
that
there
was
no
standing
to
complain
about
the
label.
i
think
that's
at
pages
54
and
55
of
the
joint
appendix...
i'm
sorry,
of
the
appendix
to
the
jurisdictional
statement.
but
more
importantly...
well,
i
suppose
not
more
importantly,
but
in
addition
to
that,
it
is
clear
also
from
the
district
court
and
from
the
law
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
showing
the
label;
that
when
he
shows
the
film
he
may
physically
remove
the
label,
if
indeed
it's
on
the
film,
or
he
may
advance
the
film
to
the
point
where
the
label
isn't
visible.
we
think
that,
for
the
same
reasons
that
there
is
no
distinct
and
palpable
injury
fairly
traceable
to
the
words
"political
propaganda",
the
removal
of
those
words
or
the
substitution
of
other
words
for
those
words
would
not
remedy
the
injury
that's
alleged.
the
films
would
still
possess
the
same
label.
the
appellee
would
still
be
associated
with
foreign
source
political
advocacy
material.
and
most
of
the
problems
that
are
cited
in
the
affidavits
would
still
exist.
now,
there
is
the
remaining
factor
of
the
affidavits
of
mr.
newman
and
mr.
doob,
which
relate
to
the
actual
connotations
of
the
words
"political
propaganda".
and
a
couple
of,
i
think,
points
need
to
be
made
from
the
statute
itself.
one
is
that
the
words
themselves
are
defined
in
the
statute
in
a
neutral
way,
and
so
we
have
to
assume
that
people
are
going
to
learn
about
the
words,
which
do
not
appear
on
the
label,
but
not
learn
about
how
they're
defined
in
the
statute
and
not
try
to
find
out,
and
jump
to
the
conclusion
based
on
common
connotations
which
people
do
sometimes
draw
from
those
words
that
the
material
is
somehow
to
be
viewed
in
a
negative
way
and,
furthermore,
that
people
associated
with
it,
who
show
it,
giving
whatever
introduction
they
may
want
to
give,
that
they
too
suffer
from
whatever
the
negative
connotations
are
of
the
material.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
in
lamont
that
the
main
distinction
that
was
drawn
by
the
court
was
the
requirement
of
some
affirmative
action,
which
i
take
to
mean
something
more
than
private
affirmative
action
like
snipping
the
label
off
of
a
film.
the
affirmative
action
required
was
the
actual
request
to
the
post
office
to
deliver
what
had
been
described
under
the
statute
as
"communist
political
propaganda".
so
that
one
has
to
go
essentially
on
some
sort
of
public
record
saving
that
one
wants
that
material
delivered
to
one's
house.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
it
would
be
a
different
case,
but
i
think
the
outcome
would
be
the
same.
the
different
case
because
attaching
the
word
"communist"
would
accentuate
the
negative
connotations
and
perhaps
increase
the
argument
for
a
genuine
cognizable,
recognizable
injury.
but
i
think
that
the
outcome
would
be
the
same,
primarily
because
the
congress
ought
to
be
free,
within
some
fairly
wide
parameters,
to
define
its
terminology
and
use
it
in
a
way
that
it
desires
to.
and
i
think
the
important
point
here
is
that
congress
has
not
made
up
a
definition
that's
completely
unrelated
to
the
word.
it
has
taken
one
of
the
main
line
conventional
meanings
of
the
word
"propaganda"
and
applied
it
to
the
word,
to
the
word.
and
it
has
done
it
in
a
way
that
the
district
court
itself
found
to
be
completely
neutral
and
without
negative
connotations.
to
suggest
that
congress
can't
take
a
word
and
select
one
of
its
definitions
and
say,
now,
we
don't
want
any
mistake,
this
is
what
we
mean,
i
think
is
to
say
that
courts
are
ready
to
invade
very
far
into
the
scope
of
congress'
authority--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
it
would
require
an
analysis
of
the
extent
of
the
harm
that
might
result.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
and
your
question
is
whether
that
would--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
if
the
word
was
defined
in
a
way
that
was
consistent
with
a
conventional
meaning
such
that
congress
was
not
making
it
up--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
in
standing
what
we're
trying
to
look
at
is
the
nature
of
the
injury,
and
we're
trying
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
cognizable
injury,
whether
it
rises
to
a
sufficient
level
that
it's
recognizable.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
think
that
would
be
a
factor.
i
think
you
would
have
to
at
least
consider
whether
congress
had
taken
a
word
which
has--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--i
don't
know
whether
the...
i
think
the
plaintiff
may
not
concede
that
it's
a
neutral
definition.
i
believe
that's
true.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
i
can't
answer
that
without
going
to
another
question,
which
i
think
ultimately
the
court
doesn't
have
to
resolve
here,
and
that
is
the
question
of
whether
government
speech
in
pursuit
of
any
goal
that
government,
congress,
whatever,
has
the
power
constitutionally
to
pursue,
whether
that
speech
may
ever
be
attacked
on
first
amendment
grounds.
and
i
think...
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
but--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i'm
not
saying
that
there
would
never
be
standing.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
guess
my
answer...
maybe
it's
not
at
all
a
complete
one,
but
my
answer
is
that
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
particular
case,
at
the
nature
of
the
harm
that
is
being
alleged.
and
where
you
have
a
statute
such
as
the
one
you're
describing,
justice
stevens,
which
is
solely
government
speaking,
it
is
not,
as
i
understand
it,
government
regulating
in
any
way
other
than
its
announcement--
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
--well,
i
think
you
would
have
to
analyze
the
nature
of
the
harm,
and
in
that
case
i
think,
assuming
a
power
in
congress
or
in
the
legislature
you're
talking
about
to
regulate
obscenity,
i
think
the
government
would
have
the
power
to
do
that.
and
if
the
harms
that
were...
i
guess
i'm
not
answering
the
standing
question.
the
standing
question
is
based
on
the
nature
of
the
harms,
and
i
think
if
a
sufficient
challenge
to
reputation
or
some
other
interest
that's
cognizable
is
alleged,
then
you
would
have
standing
to
raise
it.
but
i
do
think
you
would
have
to
look
at
precisely
how
the
term
is
being
characterized
to
determine
whether
that
kind
of
a
cognizable
interest
is
involved.
again,
i
think
the
analogy
to
this
case
is
a
good
one,
in
that
if
the
statute
which
otherwise
regulates
the
material
does
in
itself
cast
some
sort
of
a
light
over
someone,
but
nonetheless
it's
within
the
power
of
regulation,
then
the
incremental
effect
of
the
terminology
may
well
be
such
that
you
would
not
have
standing
to
challenge
just
the
terminology
when
you
lack
standing
to
challenge
the
statute
as
a
whole.
and
that's
the
situation
that
we
have
here.
we
have
a
person
who
lacks
standing
to
challenge
the
statutory
scheme
and
claims
to
have
standing
to
challenge
a
particular
term.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
would
think
that
a
person
might
be
able
to
put
together
affidavits
that
would
give
him
standing
to
come
in
and
make
that
kind
of
an
argument.
i'm
not
saying
in
this
case,
but
in
some
kind
of
a
case
that
might
be
possible
to
do.
that
has
not
been
done
here
in
terms
of
showing
harm
to
reputation.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
i
think
the
answer
to
that
is
basically
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
problem
with
the
material
that's
been
submitted
is
the
one
i
alluded
to
earlier,
that
it
is
not
in
any
sense
comparative
or
relative.
it
is
simply
looking
at
the
effects
of
public
awareness
of
the
words
"political
propaganda"
associated
with
the
film
that
this
appellee
shows.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
no,
your
honor,
we
don't,
and
we
think
it
supports
the
position
that
we
are
taking
here
that
there
is
no
standing.
the
reason
we
believe
that
is
that
there
were
three
aspects
in
block
to
the
standing
issue.
the
first
was
a
challenge
to
the
words
mr.
block's
customers
who
said,
we
will
not
buy
these
films
from
mr.
block
and
maybe
indeed
other
films
from
mr.
block,
if
they
are
classified
as
political
propaganda.
on
that
basis,
mr.
block
was
found
to
have
standing
to
come
in
and
say:
my
business
is
hurt.
i
think
that's
a
different
case
than
this
one.
the
part
of
that
case
that
is
similar
to
this
one
is
that
judge
scalia
in
that
opinion
said
that
there
is
no
standing
by
mr.
block,
on
the
part
of
mr.
block,
to
come
in
and
challenge
the
part
of
the
statute
that
requires
his
name
to
be
reported
on
a
dissemination
report
as
a
person
who
receives
more
than
100
copies.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
would
like
to,
your
honor.
on
the
merits
of
the
case,
we
think
first
of
all
that
the
merits
can
be
resolved
without
deciding
the
extent
of
the
first
amendment
protection
of
government
speech
as
speech,
that
is
government
simply
speaking
and
stating
its
view.
we
think
the
issue
here
is
simply
whether
congress
in
carrying
out
on
unchallenged
legislative
scheme,
which
is
what
we
have,
may
for
internal
classification
purposes
only
utilize
terminology
which
it
defines
in
a
clear
and
non-derogatory
way
consistent
with
one
of
several
accepted
common
meanings
of
those
words.
or
on
the
other
side,
taking
the
other
view,
congress
can
be
barred
from
doing
that
because
some
terms
that
it
uses
and
defines
neutrally
may
be
misunderstood
as
having
negative
connotations,
which
in
everyday
usage
at
times
at
least
it
may
have.
we
think
this
falls
plainly
on
the
permissible
side
of
the
first
amendment
line,
first
of
all
because
it
is,
in
terms
of
sorting
different
kinds
of
speech,
it
is
viewpoint
neutral.
now,
i
wouldn't
say
and
i
wouldn't
allege
that
it
is
applied
completely
without
regard
to
any
reference
to
content.
it
applies
with
regard
to
a
certain
category
of
speech,
like
the
contribution
reporting
requirements
in
buckley
versus
valeo.
it
applies
to
the
category
of
foreign
source
political
advocacy.
and
we
think,
given
the
interest
that
congress
had
in
mind
when
they
adopted
the
statute,
that
that
certainly
is
a
suitable
categorization
to
rely
on.
we
think
it's
particularly
important
on
the
merits
to
look
to
the
minimal
nature
of
the
harm
that
we're
talking
about.
and
again,
it's
the
incremental
harm.
it's
the
harm
from
the
words
"political
propaganda"
over
and
above
whatever
effect
on
reputation
results
from
the
statute,
which
is
unchallenged,
because
the
only
challenge
here
is
to
the
words
"political
propaganda".
we're
not
litigating
the
underlying
statute.
the
closest
cases
i
think
that
the
appellees
have
come
up
with
are
the
compelled
disclosure
of
affiliation
cases,
naacp
versus
alabama
and
that
line
of
cases.
and
there
are
several
distinctions
to
be
made.
i
think
one
is
that
there
is
no
affirmative
disclosure
required
here
at
all,
as
there
is
in
that
case.
another
is
that
i
think
the
governmental
interest
here
is
more
substantial.
and
finally,
even
if
you
accept
that
those
cases
apply
and
you
apply
the
test
which
was
invoked
in
those
cases
for
creating
an
exception
to
the
disclosure
requirement,
the
test
is
whether
they
have
made
a
reasonable
showing
of
likely
threats,
harassment,
or
reprisals,
and
i
think
it's
clear
that
no
such
showing
has
been
made
here.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
i
think
if
there
were
no
definition
there
would
be
a
stronger
argument
that
congress
intended
to
state
a
negative
view
by
relying
on
the
negative
connotations.
here
congress
has
explicitly
adjured
any
such
negative
connotations.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
well,
it
would
result
from
the
entire...
the
incremental
effect
would,
that's
correct,
yes.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
time.
mr.
donald
b.
ayer
mr.
donhoff
indicated
that
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
determine
these
issues
piece
by
piece
in
this
instance
by
singling
out
the
words
"political
propaganda"
and
taking
them
in
isolation.
i
would
like
to
agree
with
that
and
go
a
step
further
with
the
standing
argument
which
i
made
earlier,
focusing
on
the
injury,
the
palpable
injury,
and
the
redressability
of
the
injury.
and
i'd
like
to
suggest
that
perhaps
this
case
is
much
like
other
cases
that
this
court
has
decided,
where
it
has
found
no
justiciable
claim
to
exist,
where
the
claim
is
of
incidental
effects,
but
there
is
no
direct
regulation,
proscription,
compulsion,
or
any
other
kind
of
direct
adverse
treatment
involved.
allen
versus
wright
and
laird
v.
tatum
i
think
are
to
such
cases.
and
the
reason
i
suggest
that
is
i
think
that's
the
only
way
that
one
is
going
to
avoid
the
kind
of
piecemeal
litigation
that
mr.
donhoff
agrees
ought
to
be
avoided.
if
we're
going
to
let
people
come
in
and
pick
at
words
because
they
are
arguably
affected
in
some
remote
and
incidental
way,
we're
going
to
end
up
with
litigation
focusing
on
pieces
of
statutes,
rather
than
going
to
the
main
crux
of
what
someone
is
arguing
about.
i
think
that's
particularly
important
here,
where
the
issue
is
whether
congress
can
choose
words
and
indeed
also,
because
this
is
a
case
involving
foreign
policy,
where
i
think
if
any
case
is
proper
to
congress'
choice
of
words
and
congress'
judgment
this
is
one.
thank
you
very
much.
