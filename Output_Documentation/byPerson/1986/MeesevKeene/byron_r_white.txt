i
gather
that
there
wouldn't
have
been
this
case
if
all
that
was
required
was
that
this
label
be
put
on
and
with
respect
to
some
material
that
was
otherwise
described?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about...
you
don't
think
the
label
itself
is
what
was
annoying
the
plaintiff?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
identified
him
with
some
foreign
source,
wasn't
that
what
he
was
complaining
about?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
a
pollster
took
a
poll
in
the
community
and
said:
when
you
see
a
label,
when
you
see
the
following
label
do
you
know
what
it
means,
and
suppose
half
the
people
in
the
community
said:
yes,
we
know
that
when
we
see
that
label
that
there's
a
foreign
source,
we
know
the
attorney
general
has
classified
it
as
political
propaganda.
would
that
make
any
difference?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
it
make
any
difference
if
there
was
no
definition
of
"political
propaganda"
in
the
statute?
it
just
said
label
this
"political
propaganda"?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
incremental
effect
would
just
be,
would
just
result
from
people
who
knew
it
was
labeled
"political
propaganda"
but
didn't
know
what
the
definition
was?
