mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
unlike
the
characterization
of
mr.
ayer,
my
opponent,
about
the
issue
in
this
case,
i'd
like
to
begin
with
what
we
think
is
the
issue
and
the
district
court
felt
was
the
issue,
too.
this
case
is
about
a
regulatory
scheme
that
so
denigrates
the
material
within
its
scope
that
it
imperils
the
good
name
and
standing
within
the
community
of
those
who
associate
themselves
with
it
by
its
use.
it
classifies
speech
as
the
political
propaganda
of
a
foreign
power
on
the
basis
of
no
more
substantial
determination
of
what
that
speech
contains
than
that
it
does
contain
political
material
that
either
is
intended
to
influence
the
foreign
policies
of
the
united
states
or
may
reasonably
be
adapted
to
be
so
used,
without
referring
to
whether
or
not
that
reasonably
adaptation
should
be
seen
to
be
on
the
part
of
the
foreign
agent
or
the
foreign
government,
but
in
fact
if
any
material
spoken,
produced,
and
disseminated
by
any
registered
foreign
agent,
without
regard
to
their
interests
or
furthering
their
foreign
policy
interests
or
domestic
policy
interests
or
trying
to
influence
anybody
here
in
this
country,
but
simply
is
the
result
of
a
nonprofit
educational
association
producing
material
of
high
quality
journalistic
standards
for
dissemination.
if
that
kind
of
material
is
produced
without
any
intent
to
influence
the
american
public,
if
somebody
in
this
country
who
wishes
to
receive
that
material
may
so
reasonably
adapt
that
material
to
influence
this
country's
public
policies,
persons
connected
with
those
public
policies,
then
that
material
too
may
be
classified
as
political
propaganda
under
the
act.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
it
would
make
enough
of
a
difference
so
that
this
case
wouldn't
have
been
brought,
except
for
two
matters.
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
denominating
objective
journalism
or
any
other
kind
of
speech,
but
singling
it
out
from
the
stream
of
commerce
and
classifying
it
as
foreign
political
advocacy
would
be
any
less
harmful
to
senator
keene's
reputation
or
any
more
harmful
to
senator
keene's
reputation,
or
is
at
all
on
a
par
with
the
harm
that
arises
from
the
"political
propaganda"
classification,
about
which
evidence
is
replete
in
the
record
with
regard
to
that
harm.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
i
think
some
other
plaintiff,
some
other
time,
perhaps
might
have
some
question
regarding
that
particular
characterization.
we
have
not
argued
that
political
advocacy
is
something
in
and
of
itself
a
term
that
we
have
a
problem
with.
after
all,
senator
keene
is
a
professional
politician
who
advocates
all
the
time
political
points
of
view.
however,
one
must
look
at
the
classification
scheme
itself.
(a),
(b),
and
(c)
of
section
614
were
enjoined
by
the
district
court,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
they
each
use
the
term
"political
propaganda"
and
refer
to
the
material
classified
as
"political
propaganda",
and
thus
could
not
be
enforced
with
regard
to
these
particular
films
because
the
department
was
enjoined
from
classifying
these
films
in
a
pejorative
manner.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
do
not,
nor
do
i
think
this
suit
would
have
been
brought
in
the
first
place.
certainly
the
gravamen
of
the
injury
here
is
the
pejorative
classification
which
springs
from
the
statute
when
a
classification
uses
the
terminology
"political
propaganda".
when
everything
else
that
is
required
with
regard
to
that
speech
flows
from
that
initial
determination
that,
by
a
neutral
arm
of
the
government
exercising
the
power
and
authority
of
the
internal
security
section
of
the
criminal
division
of
the
department
of
justice,
this
material
is
foreign
political
propaganda,
that's
the
gravamen
of
the
injury,
with
one
small
caveat
or
footnote.
and
that
would
be
that
with
regard
to
the
label,
particularly
in
respect
to
mr.
justice
white's
question,
that
is
not
a
neutral
label
and
we've
never
conceded
that
it
was.
nor
is
the
definition
neutral.
but
sticking
with
the
label
for
a
moment,
i
would
think
that
some
of
the
same
issues
would
arise
if
congress
substituted
614
otherwise
unchanged
and
the
government
was
therefore
able
to
continue
to
require
source
identification
to
be
affixed
to
those
films
or
any
other
political
speech
subject
to
the
act--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--in
the
same
terms.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
yes,
it
is,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
well,
we
complained
of
it.
the
district
court,
because
of
a
stance
taken
by
the
department
of
justice
in
response
to
our
lawsuits,
found
that
we
had
no
standing
to
complain
of
it,
and
that
was
based
upon
the
court's
finding,
which
we
did
not
strenuously
argue
against,
that
was
based
upon
the
court's
finding
that
in
fact
if
we
had
the
freedom,
as
the
justice
department
said
we
did,
to
remove
the
label,
well
then
why
are
we
harmed
by
the
label?
we
have,
however,
come
to
this
court
under
elum-yaretsky
with
all
the
arguments
we
can
bring
to
bear
with
respect
to
the
unconstitutionality
of
this
particular
statutory
scheme.
one
of
those
arguments
is
that
appending
this
particular
source
identification
label
is
not
just
simply
source
disclosure,
which
we
don't
complain
of.
at
least
we
don't
have
any
standing...
we
haven't
reached
the
issue
of
whether,
you
know,
if
i
were
a
foreign
agent
whether
i
would
object
to
having
my
speech
burdened
to
the
extent
of
being
required
to
truthfully
represent
in
a
speech
who
the
source
of
it
is.
what
we
do
complain
of
is
that
that
label
is
a
red
flag.
it
doesn't
simply
say
this
is
made
by
the
government
of
canada,
let
alone
this
is
made
by
a
non-political
arm
of
the
government
of
canada.
it
goes
on
with
regard
to
statutory
language
that
is
to
the
ordinary
viewer
intimidating
and
ends
with
the
statement,
after
saying
that
this
material
is
being
distributed
by
a
registered
foreign
agent
and
all
of
these
records
are
on
file
with
the
department
of
justice,
public
records,
anybody
can
go
look
at
them,
as
if
ordinarily
we
examine
speakers
that
way
or
the
government
requires
speakers
to
be
on
record
that
way,
but
it
ends
by
saying
that
the
government,
by
allowing
the
film
to
be
shown
or
the
material
to
be
distributed,
does
not
approve
the
contents
therein.
we
do
not
have
a
system
whereby
the
government
ordinarily
stands
astride
the
stream
of
commerce
in
the
marketplace
of
ideas,
in
the
stream
of
ideas
in
speech
and
debate,
and
assumes
the
power
to
approve
or
disapprove
speech,
foreign
or
domestic.
if
this
particular
label
were
required
to
be
affixed
to
material
produced
here
by
domestic
speakers
and
classified
on
the
same
basis,
that
it
spoke
to
the
foreign
policies
of
this
nation,
i
don't
think
this
court
would
find
it
to
be
constitutional.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
oh,
yes.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
well,
yes,
it
is,
assuming
that
we
either
take
it
off,
black
it
out,
or,
as
the
government
suggest--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--advance
the
film.
but
there's
a
further
problem.
now
what
we've
done
is
hide
something
from
the
american
public,
which
the
government
has
contended
all
along
is
the
whole
reason
for
section
614's
disclosure
requirement
in
the
first
place.
that
is,
to
let
sunshine
shine
where
darkness
otherwise
was,
to
inform
the
american
public
of
the
source
so
they
could
better
appraise--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--the
district
court
found...
i
think
that's
correct.
the
district
court
found
that
it
is
a
surprised
reader
who
would
read
that
statute
and
find
that
he
could
remove
the
label.
but
indeed,
the
justice
department
says
they
interpret
the
statute
as
not
requiring
recipients
to
affix
the
label
or
use
the
label
or
show
the
label,
and
i
think
the
district
court
was
right
in
accepting
the
government's
characterization.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
yes,
ma'am,
i
do.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
i
do.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
i
have
no
doubt
that
that's
entirely
incorrect.
and
the
reason
is
because
individuals
who
come
to
government
to
become
public
officials
were
private
individuals
with
first
amendment
rights
before
they
came
to
their
government
posts
and
don't
lose
those
rights
when
they
assume
them.
there
are
certain
responsibilities
in
the
exercise
of
governmental
authority,
however,
which
they
are
now
uniquely
qualified
to
do
because
they
are
no
longer
private
citizens,
but
do
have
a
public
responsibility,
which
must
be
constrained
by
constitutional
restraints,
one
of
which
is
the
first
amendment.
if
the
government
chooses
to
denounce
the
ku
klux
klan
or
those
in
the
ku
klux
klan--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--and
follows
due
process
in
doing
so--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--that
is
not
our
position
at
all.
that
is
the
government's
characterization
of
our
position
and
a
misreading
of
the
district
court
below
and
a
disregard
of
all
of
the
argument
and
evidence
with
respect
to
this
issue
that
was
presented
in
the
district
court.
we
are
challenging
a
regulatory
act
on
the
part
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
an
exercise
of
authority,
not
an
expression
of
opinion.
we
don't
care
what
mr.
clarkson
thinks
or
feels
about
these
films.
but
as
head
of
the
registration
unit,
if
he
decides
that
they
are
political
propaganda
and
classifies
them
as
such
and
requires
them
to
be
regulated
as
such,
that
removes
those
films
from
the
universe
of
all
the
speech
that
my
client,
the
appellee
here,
can
use
to
speak
to
his
constituents
or
inform
himself.
i
think
that's--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--all
right.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
the
disclosure--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--of
course
it's
a
truthful
statement,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
it's
also
a
truthful
statement
to
make
a
witness
say,
no,
i
stopped
beating
my
wife
last...
i
don't
know
when
i
stopped
beating
my
wife
last.
it's
a
statement,
truthful
though
it
may
be,
that
raises
and
begs
the
question.
it
raises
the
hackles
of
suspicion
in
the
audience.
it's
intended
to
do
so.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
if
source
disclosure
here
was
narrowly
crafted
to
appraise
the
audience
of
the
source
of
film,
we
would
not
be
here
today.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
i
recommend
to
you
the
actual
language
of
that
label,
which
i'm
sure
you've
examined.
that
label
to
an
audience
doesn't
say
this
is
the
source
of
the
film.
it
says
also
the
source
of
the
film
is
a
registered
foreign
agent--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--whose
records
are
on
file
in
the
department
of
justice.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
oh,
no
question.
i'm
assuming
all
of
this
is
true,
and
in
fact
we've
taken
the
position
and
posture
here
that
these
films
are
correctly
classified.
so
there's
no
question
of
the
construction
of
the
statute,
as
to
whether
they
should
be
applied
to
these
particular
films.
the
label
is
true,
but
it
raises
the
hackles
of
suspicion
on
the
part
of
the
audience
and
is
intended
to
do
so.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
well,
why--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--all
right.
perhaps
the
source
of
the
problem
is
in
the
discrimination
inherent
in
using
that
particular
way
of,
in
effect,
setting
up
an
ad
hominem
argument
to
whatever
the
speech
might
actually
have
to
say
on
the
merits
and
raising
the
ad
hominem
argument
on
the
basis
of
the
foreign
source.
all
it
requires
to
be
classified
under
614
is
that
it's
distributed
by
a
foreign
agent.
there's
no
showing
that
the
foreign
agent
is
lying,
misleading,
intending
to
further
his
own
interests
at
the
expense
of
the
audience,
or
in
any
way
even
furthering
his
own
interests.
for
example,
justice
stevens,
should
the
national
film
board
of
canada
decide
to
do
a
documentary
on
the
problems
of
clearing
the
brazilian
rain
forest
and
in
that
documentary
mention
that
american
foreign
aid
money
goes
to
help
finance
some
of
the
clearing,
the
canadian
government
probably
doesn't
even
know
about
the
film,
let
alone
feel
that
it's
in
its
own
interests
to
produce
it
and
disseminate
it.
but
the
film
board
through
its
policies
and
practices
may
wish
to
do
so,
and
distribute
the
material
into
this
country.
and
at
that
point
that
material,
because
it
mentions
a
foreign
policy
of
the
united
states
and
could,
not
intended
to
but
could
reasonably
be
adapted
to
by
someone
in
this
country
affect
those
foreign
policies,
now
is
going
to
be
designated
as
political
propaganda
and,
further,
must
have
affixed
to
it
this
red
flag
of
a
warning
label
that
the
government
doesn't
approve
the
contents
of
this
material.
i
think
that
it
is
a
mistake
to
take
this
case
piece
by
piece,
without
reference
to
the
other
portions
of
the
statute.
primarily
what
we're
looking
at
is
the
political
propaganda
designation,
and
that
then
impregnates
the
rest
of
the
statute.
as
the
government
concedes--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--oh,
i
think
so.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
i
don't
think
that's
a
neutral
definition,
your
honor.
that's
the
other
thing
we
have
not
conceded.
in
fact,
the
district
court
assumed
really
that
the
definition
was
neutral,
because
the
argument
was
with
regards
to
the
ordinary
principles
of
statutory
construction.
you
read
that
statute
and
you
find
a
clause
here
and
a
clause
here
and
a
clause
there
that
seem
to
come
up
with
an
objective
standard,
you
ignore
all
the
rest
of
it.
now,
this
court
has
in
a
number
of
cases
indicated
that
you
don't
read
statutes
that
way.
i
think
in
mcgrath
at
least
one
of
the
opinions--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
no,
sir.
i'm
sorry,
i
misspoke.
all
the
sections
of
614
that
were
enjoined
by
the
court,
(a),
(b),
and
(c).
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
with
respect
to
these
films?
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
with
respect
to
these
films?
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
what
the
district
court
did
in
may
of
1983
is
enjoin
the
classification
of
these
films
or
the
regulation
of
them
as
political
propaganda.
so
no
dissemination
reports
have
been
filed,
no--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--as
a
purveyor
of
or
exhibitor
of
these
films?
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
no,
sir,
because
we
didn't
show
them
or
arrange
to
receive
them
so
that
we
could
show
them
prior
to
getting
the
injunction.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
prior
to
bringing
the
suit
and
getting
the
injunction,
no.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
well,
i
think
i
have
to
agree
with
mr.
ayer
to
a
certain
extent,
and
that
is
that
one
must
look,
rather
than
for
absolute
principles,
for
particular
injuries
under
particular
circumstances.
the
labor
organizer's
or
disorganizer's,
as
the
case
may
be,
status
as
defined
by
a
statute
to
the
extent
that
it
harms
his
reputation,
if
he
quarrels
with
that
status,
may
indeed
give
him
standing.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
i'll
go
this
far,
i
think,
in
meeting
the
government's
objection
with
regard
to
the
camel's
nose
under
the
tent
argument.
that
is,
at
least
when
we're
dealing
with
the
expression
of
pure
political
core
value
protected
speech
and
nothing
else,
that
the
government
is
constrained
from
so
classifying
the
material,
irrespective
of
the
regulations
that
they
may
otherwise
be
justified
in
imposing.
but
so
classifying
the
material
as
to
impair
the
usefulness
of
that
material
to
citizens
of
this
country
or
those
within
its
borders
and
expressing
themselves
in
public
debate.
to
the
extent
that
labor
organizing
or
disorganizing
also
is
a
matter
of
activity
which
may
be
illegal
or
made
illegal
or
otherwise
regulated
that
is
not
pure
expression,
then
maybe
the
standard
would
be
lesser.
however,
when
you're
dealing
with
pure
speech
one
must
ask,
what's
the
reason
for
this
designation.
i
think
we
can
start,
certainly,
with
talking
about
standing
and
the
harm,
and
i
intend
to
get
to--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--no,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
we're
not
a
commercial
exhibitor.
we
don't
measure
our
harm
by
box
offices.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
because
we
can't
use
it.
that's
the
simple
answer.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
and
then
we
get
back
to
the
original
question
you
asked--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--we
use
it
and
it
harms
our
reputation,
it's
that
simple.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
that's
happened
in
the
past.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
no,
sir.
but
the
government
didn't
classify
the
foreign
cars
as
the
agent
of
foreign
subversion
either.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
they
may,
but
here's
the
difference.
if
they
call
my
client
a
propagandist,
a
foreign
political
propagandist--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--they
can
do
that
no
matter
what.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
but
if
the
government
classifies
these
materials
to
be
such,
it
makes
reasonable
the
inference
my
client
is
a
purveyor
of
such
material.
we
have
no
standing
then
under
new
york
times-sullivan
to
complain
in
a
plain
state
law
action,
a
tort
action
for
defamation,
should
we
wish
to
do
that
rather
than,
as
is
the
normal
case,
take
the
slings
and
arrows
of
political
debate.
in
other
words,
irrespective
of
what
the
government's
intent
was
with
regard
to
these
particular
films.
thes
scheme
itself
serves
to
segregate
out
some
speech
from
all
the
rest
of
the
speech
and
impose
a
penalty
or
a
risk
created
or
connected
with
it,
depending
upon
who
you
are.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
no,
sir.
the
penalty
is
associating
somebody
who
would
speak
with
that
speech,
through
that
speech,
to
express
his
own
views
and
the
purveyor
of
political
propaganda.
i
believe
that
the
phrase
and
the
likelihood
of
the
injury
is
established
by
competent
and
substantial
evidence
in
the
record.
but
if
you
want
to
look
at
the
evidence,
we
had
a
poll
designed
by
a
very
competent
poll
designer
and
then
taken
by
the
gallup
organization
throughout
the
country,
which
showed
that
if
you
told
people
that
a
legislator
showed
films
that
the
justice
department
had
classified
as
foreign
political
propaganda
they
would
be
as
disinclined
to
vote
for
that
individual,
thus
harming
his
reputation,
one
measure
of
harming
his
reputation,
as
they
would
be
if
he
had
lied
about
his
academic
credentials
or
a
juvenile
conviction
for
robbery.
i
mean,
this
is
not
a
quibble
over
terminology.
we
have
clearly
a
derogatory,
pejorative
term
that
makes
people
shy
off
as
if
it
were
a
land
mine
and
avoid
that
speech.
depending
upon
who
you
are,
how
much
public
opinion
means
to
you,
that
i
think
is
the
gravamen
of
our
injury.
if
it
does
not
appear
to
be
sufficient
to
this
court
that
is
the
gravamen
of
our
injury,
then
we
would
lose.
but
i
think
it's
very,
very
important
that
the
reputations
of
persons
who
wish
to
speak
do
not
get
threatened,
not
by
the
slings
and
arrows
of
political
debate
and
opponents
drawing
conclusions
or
editorial
writers
drawing
conclusions,
but
by
the
neutral
exercise
of
governmental
authority
designating
materials.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
it's
in
the
appendix
under
the
declaration
of
leonard
wood,
78
et
seq.
,
and
i
think
very
close
to
78.
the
question
asked
is...
well,
it
appears
on
80
and
81
of
the
joint
appendix.
i
think
perhaps
this
would
be
an
appropriate
time
to
mention
a
couple
of
points
on
standing.
this
is
not
a
laird-tatum
case.
we're
not
speculating
about
what
happens
to
us.
we
have
introduced
competent
and
substantial
evidence
to
show
what
the
public's
reaction
to
public
officials
who
disseminate
the
political
propaganda
of
foreign
powers
is
in
this
country,
and
we're
concerned
about
our
reputation
if
we
use
the
films
and-or
if
we
don't
get
the
injunction
or
the
injunction
is
listed
we
can't
use
the
films.
there
is
a
myriad
of
things
that
occur
in
the
political
process
that
is
a
basis
for
calling
in
analogies,
even
with
lamont's
very
narrow
constrictions
that
you
have
to
have
some
affirmative
act
to
show
impairment.
and
that
would
be
that,
should
be
show
the
films
without
the
injunction,
they're
classified,
we
have
to
both
take
steps
to
hide
the
label
because
it's
a
warning
flag--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--it's
a
facial
challenge
to
the
section,
yes,
it
is,
sir.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
yes,
i
can
say
that
with
some
confidence.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
no,
sir,
it's
not
partially
overbreadth.
it's
that
classifying
any
protected
speech
as
political
propaganda
is
unconstitutional.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
there's
no
application
of
this
statute
that
would
be
valid,
that's
true.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
it
does
for
standing,
sir,
as
i
understand
it.
we
have
to
show
a
palpable
and
distinct
injury
fairly
traceable
to
the
statute
that
is
redressable
by
the
court
before
we
can
even
come
into
court
to
complain
that
this
is
an
unconstitutional
statute.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
i
will
accept
that
as
a
proposition.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
all
right.
i
think
we
still
have
to
complain
of...
the
overbreadth
doctrine
is
like
an
accordian
at
times,
as
i
read
the
cases.
we
are
not
talking
about
overbreadth
in
the
standard
sense
of,
say,
an
obscenity
case,
where
we
may
be
obscene
but
some
other
person
wouldn't
because
of
the
definitions
in
the
statute
or
the
way
it's
enforced.
what
we
are
talking
about,
though,
is
a
statute
that
on
its
face
is
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
any
speech,
not
just
these
three
films,
although
the
injunction
was
narrowed
to
the
three
films.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
to
the
three
films.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
no,
the
declaratory...
the
declaration
was
that
the
statute
was
unconstitutional
on
its
face
because
of
the
use
of
the
term
"political
propaganda".
i
would
go
further
and
say
because
of
the
way
the
source
disclosure
is
required.
i
don't
assume
that
simply
because
we
have
standing
because
we
have
some
palpable
injury
that
we
need
not
show
any
further
first
amendment
injury.
at
least
i
haven't
assumed
it
throughout
litigating
this
case.
what
we
do
show
is
harm
sufficient
to
impair
us
or
keep
us
from
availing
ourselves
of
using
this
speech
or,
if
we
don't
get
an
injunction,
we
are
going
to
be
penalized
or
must
take
some
affirmative
acts
to
forestall
the
public
reaction
that's
going
to
result
should
we
be
identified
as
a
purveyor
of
political
propaganda.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
we
have
alleged,
yes,
sir,
in
the
record
that
we...
i
would
think
probably
some
time
next
year.
there
are
no
specified
times,
but
yes.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
no,
it
was
not
stayed.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
we
have
shown
the
films.
after
we
received
the
preliminary
injunction,
we
showed
them
almost
immediately
after
receiving
the
injunction,
before
the
opinion
came
out,
and
then
again
some
months
later.
a
couple
of
years
have
passed
now
since
the
last
time
they
were
shown.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
well--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--but
they
haven't
been
allowed
to
be,
or
at
least--
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
--oh,
certainly.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
anybody
can
lie,
justice
stevens.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
and
we
have
the
rebuttal
that
the
court
found
that
the
government
was
wrong
in
so
classifying.
mr.
john
g.
donhoff,
jr.
the
label
was
not
affixed
to
them,
sir.
