unknown
speaker
would
it
make
any
difference
in
your
argument,
mr.
donhoff,
if
instead
of
political
propaganda
congress
had
used
the
term
"foreign
advocacy",
so
that
you
had
to
say
it
was
a
foreign
advocacy
film?
unknown
speaker
so
you
would
regard
it
as
something
for
another
evidentiary
inquiry,
really?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
get
at
is
how
far
the
district
court's
pejorative
manner
ruling
goes.
supposing
that
the
statute
had
just
said,
this
is
classified
as
a
foreign
film.
unknown
speaker
now,
do
you
think
the
district
court,
if
you
had
presented
a
poll
saying
that
a
lot
of
people
don't
like
the
idea
of
legislators
looking
at
foreign
films,
would
then
have
enjoined
that
sort
of
a
classification?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
label--
unknown
speaker
--the
label
isn't
at
issue
here,
i
take
it?
unknown
speaker
how
is
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
true
that
the
terms
"political
propaganda"
are
not
part
of
the
label--
unknown
speaker
--to
the
film?
unknown
speaker
and
is
it
also
true
that
senator
keene
can
show
the
film
without
showing
the
label?
unknown
speaker
or
just
not
run
that
part
of
the
film?
unknown
speaker
but
the
statute
at
least
does
not
require
your
client
to
show
that
label,
isn't
that
so?
unknown
speaker
mr.
donhoff,
do
you
think
that
the
government
as
such
and
government
officials
have
any
leeway
for
free
speech--
unknown
speaker
--of
their
own?
unknown
speaker
and
almost
any
official
government
pronouncement
on
any
subject,
for
instance
denouncing
the
ku
klux
klan,
might
in
some
sense
suppress
free
expression
by
somebody.
unknown
speaker
it's
your
position
that
the
legislative
body--
unknown
speaker
--cannot
use
its
collective
voice
to
characterize
certain
actions
in
a
certain
way?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
understand
that
argument.
why
does
it
remove
it?
why
can't
he
show
the
film
with
the
label
on
it?
he
gets
the
message
across
he
wants
to
get
across.
he
just
has
to
disclose
a
fact
he'd
prefer
to
omit.
unknown
speaker
the
label
is
truthful,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
take
the
case
for
the
moment
that
it's
impractical
to
take
the
label
off.
what
is
wrong
with
requiring
the
label
on
the
film
even
if
they
did?
it's
a
truthful
statement,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
any
different
from
saying
you've
got
to
put
a
copyright
statement
on
the
film?
unknown
speaker
it's
intended
to
advise
the
audience
of
the
source
of
the
film,
and
what's
so
wrong
about
that?
unknown
speaker
why
isn't
it
crafted
just
to
do
precisely
that?
unknown
speaker
which
is
true.
unknown
speaker
which
is
true.
unknown
speaker
by
pointing
out
that
the
speaker
might
be
biased
by
the
interest
that
is
reflected
in
the
label.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
your
case
is
an
attractive
one
because
it's
a
canadian
film,
but
supposing
at
the
time
the
statute
was
first
drafted
it
was
a
german
film
or
something
like
that.
the
audience
would
be
particularly
interested
in
the
source
and
so
forth.
why
doesn't
the
same
consideration
apply?
maybe
i
just
missed
something
obvious.
unknown
speaker
you
spoke
of
the
pejorative
impact
of
those
words.
suppose
somebody
saw
the
label
and
he
accepted
the
invitation
to
look
at
what
was
all
behind
this
and
said,
this
is
political
propaganda
under
the
statute
and
i
read
the
definition.
now,
would
the
impact
on
that
person
be
pejorative
in
your
mind?
unknown
speaker
he's
read
the
definition.
unknown
speaker
counsel--
unknown
speaker
--i
think
in
one
of
your
responses
to
justice
white
you
said
that
the
use
of
the
term
"political
propaganda"
impregnates
the
whole
statute.
is
it
your
position
the
entire
statute
is
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
you
are
challenging
only
the
sections
that
the
district
court
in
its
revision
of
its
final
order
enjoined?
unknown
speaker
while
i
have
you
interrupted,
is
your
client's
name
on
any
published
list
anywhere?
unknown
speaker
sir?
unknown
speaker
yes.
any
published
list?
unknown
speaker
but
prior
to
the
bringing
of
this
suit,
was
your
client's
name
on
any
published
list
with
respect
to--
unknown
speaker
--yes.
unknown
speaker
was
his
name
on
any
published
list
as
a
recipient
of
them?
unknown
speaker
mr.
donhoff,
supposing
that
congress
in
its
labor
statute
decides
that
it
wants
to
regulate
certain
activities
which
it
calls
strike-breaking
activities,
and
among
the
forms
of
regulation
it
adopts
it
says
that
people
engaging
in
the
following
activities
have
to
register
as
a
strike-breaker.
and
your
client
in
this
new
case
is
not
the
state
senator
from
california;
he's
a
labor
organizer
who
falls
within
that
definition.
do
you
think
he
can
challenge
the
definition
because
he
says
that's
not
a
neutral
definition
of
strike-breaker?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
fairly
broad
principle,
isn't
it,
if
you
can
look
at
congressional
classifications
which
involve
any
sort
of
registration
or
that
sort
of
thing
and
say,
it's
not
a
fair
description
of
what
i'm
doing?
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
interrupt
with
one
question.
you
said
impair
the
usefulness
of
the
speech.
have
you
in
connection
with
your
standing
argument
alleged
or
contended
that
the
number
of
people
who
will
see
the
film
is
lessened
by
this?
unknown
speaker
well
then,
how
does
it
impair
the
usefulness
of
the
speech?
unknown
speaker
but
if
you
have
the
same
audience,
as
big
an
audience
as
you
otherwise
would
have,
why
is
the
speech
less
useful?
unknown
speaker
why
can't
you?
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you
can't
use
it
because
somebody
might
say
you're
a
purveyor
of
foreign
propaganda?
unknown
speaker
but
the
affidavits
say
people
will...
your
political
opponents
and
the
like
will
say
you
drive
foreign
cars
and
you
have
foreign
sympathies,
and
so
forth.
unknown
speaker
but
you
can't
really
totally
prevent
that
kind
of
rather
irresponsible
criticism.
unknown
speaker
no,
but
even
if
they
changed
the
name
from
"political
propaganda"
to
"political
advocacy"
or
just
foreign
source
material,
these
critics
can
still
make
precisely
the
same
criticism
of
your
candidate.
unknown
speaker
they
can
do
that
no
matter
what
the
government
label
says.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
the
penalty
is
just
telling
the
truth
about
the
source
of
the
speech.
unknown
speaker
where
in
the
record
is
the
question
that
the
poll
takers
asked
to
get
this?
unknown
speaker
your
challenge
is
a
facial
one
to
the
section,
isn't
it?
are
you
just
challenging
it
as
applied
to
your
client?
unknown
speaker
and
would
you
say
that
you
can
think
of
no
circumstance
in
which
it
would
be
valid
as
applied?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
to?
unknown
speaker
don't
you
have
to
make
that
allegation,
or
don't
you
have
to
make
that
claim?
or
is
your
claim
partially
overbreadth,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
well,
so
you're
saying
that
there
is
no
application
of
the
statute
that
would
be
valid?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
spite
of
then
all
the
material
about
the
particular
aspects
of
your
client
being
a
state
legislator
and
what
people
think
about
state
legislators
really
doesn't
make
any
difference?
unknown
speaker
but
then
it
makes
no
difference
on
the
merits,
because
the
statute
is
invalid
even
as
applied
to
someone
who
has
none
of
his
specific
problems?
unknown
speaker
well,
i'm
not
peddling
it.
i
just
want
to
know
your
view.
[laughter]
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
you
mean,
is
the
judgment
only...
i
thought
there
was
an
injunction
against
applying
the
statute
at
all?
unknown
speaker
but
how
about
the
declaratory
relief?
unknown
speaker
are
the
films
still
available?
do
you
still
want
to
show
them?
unknown
speaker
has
the
judgment
been
stayed?
was
it
stayed?
unknown
speaker
well,
have
you
shown
the
films?
unknown
speaker
could
you
explain
one
thing
to
me.
if
you
have
shown
the
films
and
the
statute's
still
on
the
books,
why
isn't
your
client
getting
the
same
terrible
criticism
that
he
would
have
gotten
without
the
injunction?
unknown
speaker
couldn't
a
critic
of
your
client
say,
he
has
shown
three
films
that
were
classified
by
the
united
states
department
of
justice
as
foreign
propaganda?
unknown
speaker
the
third
party
can't
make
that
statement?
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
all
the
people
that
might
harm
his
reputation
can
still
say
exactly
what
you
said
they
might.
unknown
speaker
but
it's
not
a
lie.
they
were
in
fact
classified
as
political
propaganda.
unknown
speaker
well,
and
that's
the
difference,
and
that
protects
you
from
this
grievous
harm?
when
you
showed
them,
did
you
take
the
label
off
or
not?
unknown
speaker
i
see.
