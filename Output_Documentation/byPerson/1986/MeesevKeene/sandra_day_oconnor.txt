mr.
ayer,
in
that
regard
i
guess
senator
keene
submitted
uncontroverted
affidavits
that
exhibiting
the
films
would
harm
his
re-election
efforts.
could
that
give
him
sufficient
injury
to
give
him
standing,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
he
submitted
affidavits
showing
third
party
resentment
or
consequences
to
him
if
he
exhibited
the
films,
isn't
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
would
you
distinguish
the
lamont
versus
the
postmaster
general
case?
that
certainly
discusses
the
coercive
effect
of
labeling
for
standing
purposes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
this
be
a
different
case
if
we
were
dealing
with
something
that
the
congress
had
labeled
communist
political
propaganda
on
these
films?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
wasn't
there
a
gallup
poll
in
this
case
and
affidavits
of
even
republicans
as
well
as
democratic
campaign
managers
going
to
the
effect
on
this
particular
respondent's
campaign?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
disagree
with
the
standing
analysis
that
justice
scalia,
when
he
was
serving
as
judge
scalia
on
the
court
of
appeals,
wrote
in
block
against
meese?
