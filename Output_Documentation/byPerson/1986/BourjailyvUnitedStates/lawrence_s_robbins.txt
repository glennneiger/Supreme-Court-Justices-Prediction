mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
rule
of
evidence
that
the
government
in
its
brief
has
characterized
as
the
bootstrapping
rule,
substantially
and
unjustifiably,
we
believe,
skews
the
decision
making
process,
the
admissibility
of
co-conspirator
statements.
a
brief
example
illustrates
how
bad
the
rule
can
work.
suppose
some
fbi
agents
secure
a
wiretap
and
in
that
wiretap
is
a
conversation
between
mr.
seller,
the
declarant,
and
mr.
buyer,
a
known
confederate
in
the
stolen
car
business.
in
that
conversation
mr.
seller
says
that
he
met
the
day
before
with
the
defendant
at
clark's
garage
and
he
says
that
he
received
from
the
defendant
a
stolen
green
bmw,
which
he
drove
away
with,
for
$1,000.
he
says
to
the
seller,
you
ought
to
contact
the
defendant
and
he
can
give
you
all
the
stolen
cars
you
want.
and
it
turns
out
the
agents
also
secure
the
following
two
pieces
of
so-called
independent
evidence;
one,
surveillance
that
establishes
that
the
seller
and
the
defendant
did
indeed
meet
at
clark's
garage
and
that
the
seller
drove
away
in
a
green
bmw;
and
second,
a
single
slip
of
paper
bearing
the
defendant's
handwriting
and
found
in
the
trash
can
at
clark's
garage
that
has
the
notation,
1,000>
["]
on
it.
now,
a
trial
judge
faced
with
just
that
information,
and
it's
information
like
that
that
comes
up
daily
in
federal
criminal
trials,
a
trial
judge
with
that
information
would
in
all
likelihood
conclude
the
following:
one,
the
statement
clearly
took
place.
it's
on
a
wiretap.
two,
it
was
amply
corroborated
by
the
so-called
independent
evidence.
three,
it
was
made
to
a
long-time
confederate
and
was
substantially
against
the
declarant's
penal
interest.
in
short,
applying
the
factors
that
this
court
identified
in
the
matlock
case
the
judge
would
in
all
likelihood
conclude
that
the
declarant's
statement
was
highly
probative,
almost
assuredly
true,
and
certainly
the
least
equivocal
evidence
there
would
be
that
the
seller
and
the
defendant
were
members
of
fine
same
conspiracy.
yet,
because
of
the
bootstrapping
rule,
the
seller's
statement
could
not
be
used
to
establish
the
existence
of
a
conspiracy
between
the
seller
and
the
defendant.
that
is
because
the
so-called
independent
evidence
standing
alone
might
very
well
not
satisfy
preponderance
standard.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
precisely.
that's
the
way
the
courts
have
applied
this
rule,
uniformly.
what
they
do
is
they
take
the
statement...
some
courts
nave
been
sophisticated
enough
to
recognize
that
you
can
look
at
the
co-conspirator
statements'
non-hearsay
aspects.
but
a
number
of
courts
are
reading
the
bootstrapping
language
in
glasser
quite...
we
think
overreading
it,
have
taken
the
co-conspirator
statements,
put
it
sort
of
under
a
box
and
looked
at
everything
else
in
the
case.
and
in
the
hypothetical
that
i've
given
i
think
it's
quite
clear
that
looking
at
that
independent
evidence
by
itself,
a
court
would
probably
conclude
that
there
was
no
conspiracy.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
think,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
answer
is,
"it
depends".
it
could
in
a
case
in
which
a
trial
judge
found
by
a
preponderant
standard
that
because
of
the
context
in
which
the
statement
was
made,
the
extent
to
which
it
might
be
against
the
declarant's
penal
interest,
or
the
person
to
whom
it
was
given,
the
stage
of
the
conspiracy
in
which
it
was
made;
a
statement
standing
alone
could...
could
in
the
judge's
discretion
be
enough
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
we
say
that.
that
doesn't
mean...
i
mean,
our
position
has
been
sort
of
extravagantly
construed
in
petitioner's
reply
brief
to
suggest
that
we
will
be
inevitably
opening
a
floodgate
of
unreliable
evidence.
all
we
are
contending
for
is
that
the
trial
judge
doesn't
have
to
put
on
blinders
and
ignore
highly
probative,
highly
reliable
evidence.
there
may
be
cases
in
which
the
statement
standing
alone
meets
that
standard
but
it
won't
necessarily
be
the
case.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes,
of
course
he
can.
his
finding
would
be
that,
"i've
looked
at
the
statement."
"i've
considered
it
in
the
context
of
the
case."
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
doesn't.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
it's
not
excluded.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
it
will
not
be
sufficient
to
make
the
predicate
finding
of
conspiracy
necessary
to
admit
co-conspirator
statements
under
rule
801(d)(2)(e).
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
yes.
he
could
conclude--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--precisely.
it's
important
to
see
that
rule
104
made
a
fundamental
change
in
the
way
these
decisions
were
made.
the
old
rule
was,
petitioner's
representations
this
afternoon
notwithstanding,
the
old
rule
was
that
the
final
word
on
the
admissibility
of
co-conspirator
statements
was
the
jury's,
and
you
don't
have
to
look
any
further
than
the
1977
edition
of
devitt
and
blackmore
to
find
that
they
recommend
a
charge
that
leaves
in
the
jury's
hand--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
my
impression
is
that
there
was
not
a
prior
word
by
the
judge
but
the
important
thing
is
that--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--it's
not
my--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--no.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
agree
that
trial
judges
may
well
have
done
some
kind
of
screening.
the
important
thing--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
no.
justice
stevens,
we're
not
suggesting
that
trial
courts
have
somehow
capitulated
on
determinations
of
hearsay.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
it
was
the
standard
practice,
routinely
given
in
trial
courts.
the
cases
that
we
have
cited
in
the
brief
are
for
the
most
part
actual
jury
charges
given
in
the
first
half
of
the
20th
century.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
and
we're
not
saying
that
there
was
no
preliminary
screening.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
the
final
word,
the
final
determination
as
to
how--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
we
think
it
makes
a
good
deal
of
difference
for
purposes
of
explaining
how
it
came
to
be
that
the
rule
against
bootstrapping
hearsay
evidence
emerged.
the
fact
is
that
at
the
time
glasser
was
decided,
and
for
the
next
33
years
it
remained
the
case
that
juries
were
sent
co-conspirator
statements
and
told
that,
"you
are
free
to
use
it
or
not
use
it,
but
you
may
only
use
it
if
you
first
make
your
own
determination
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt."
the
concern,
i
think,
was
that
as
long
as
juries
were
making
that
final
determination,
they
might
well
be
relying
on
incompetent
evidence
that
they
ought
not
rely
on.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
we
think
it
is
changed
by
the
rule
because
the
rule
says
that
the
judge
can
consider
all
evidence,
and
it's
quite
clear,
all
other
evidence
is
non-privileged.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
we
would
prefer,
actually,
not
to
look
behind
the
plain
language
of
the
rule.
we
think
the
rule
says
what
it
says.
it
says
the
judge
is
not
bound
by
the
rules
of
evidence.
it
is
quite
clear
that
when
this
court
decided
the
glasser
case,
the
rationale
of
the
bootstrapping
rule
was
that
if
you
didn't
have
such
a
rule,
hearsay
would
be
raised
to
the
level
of
competent
evidence.
the
concern
was
about
hearsay.
rule
104(a)
tosses
that
concern
out
for
good.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i'm
sorry,
mr.
justice
white?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
would
take
that
statement
to
be
that
the
rules
of
evidence
are
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
that
he
is
not
bound
by,
part
of
which
is
the
rule
against
hearsay
of
which
the
bootstrapping
rule
is
one
aspect.
the
bootstrapping
rule
is
a
rule
about
hearsay.
you
go
back
to
read
glasser
anti
it's
quite
clear
that
mr.
justice
black
in
describing
and
defending
the
rule
to
the
extent
it
was
defended
in
that
opinion
stated
that,
"our
concern
is
that
hearsay
will
be
elevated
to
a
level
that
it
doesn't
deserve."
it's
quite
clear
from
rule
104(a)
and
from
the
advisory
committee
notes
which
talked
about
the
fact
that
quite
often
you'll
have
to
use
the
statement
itself
before
it's
admitted--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--i
am
familiar,
justice
marshall,
with
judge
friendly's
opinion.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
unless
i
am
wrong,
gainey
is
a
pre-rules
decision
in
the
second
circuit,
and
although
it
has
been
followed
by
the
second
circuit
in
two
of
the
second
circuit's
most
recent
decisions,
united
states
against
chakali
and
united
states
against
de
jesus,
judge
winner
has
had
occasion
to
suggest...
and
it
is
no
more
than
a
suggestion,
i
acknowledge...
that
the
continuing
vitality
of
gainey
may
be
a
bit
up
for
grabs
in
light
of
rule
104(a).
our
contention
is
that
it
is
not
up
for
grabs;
that
congress
enacted
a
rule.
the
rule
has
a
plain
meaning.
the
advisory
committee
notes
confirm
that
plain
meaning.
and
courts,
although
they
nave
felt
constrained
to
follow
the
rule
in
glasser
because
it's
still
on
the
books,
nevertheless
are
obliged
under
rule
104(a)
to
give
the
judge
the
freedom
to
take
off
blinders
and
make
a
rational
decision
in
light
of
all
the
non-privileged
evidence.
i
realize
gainey
is
still
on
the
books
but
we
think
if
has
been
superceded
by
congress.
now,
there
have
been
some
defenses
of
the
rule
against
bootstrapping,
the
defense
that
it
comes
from
an
agency
rationale,
the
defense
that
it
provides
additional
reliability.
our
view
is
that
additional
objection
was
in
fact
sustained.
at
other
times,
objections
were
overruled
based
upon
a
relevancy
determination.
but
none
of
these
were
raised
in
the
context
of
the
sentencing.
they
were
raised
in
the
context
of
the
trial
phase
itself.
but
of
course,
defense
counsel
did
not
limit
the
jury's
consideration
of
these
factors
at
sentencing
to
only
those
he
presented.
he
simply
used
hitchcock's
brother
to
present
the
icing
on
the
cake,
then
referred
back
to
all
of
the
other
factors
that
had
been
brought
out.
and
as
conceded
by
the
petitioner,
if
you
look
at
those
factors
you're
not
going
to
be
able
to
place
them
within
any
of
the
statutory
circumstances.
they
are
in
fact
non-statutory
mitigating
factors.
they
are
pleas
that
this
man
can
be
rehabilitated,
that
there
are
other
circumstances
that
you
don't
know
about:
he
came
from
a
poor
sharecropper's
family.
all
of
these
other
things
are
of
no
consequence
under
florida's
statutory
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstance
scheme.
they
are
surely
non-statutory
factors,
and
the
jury
was
made
aware
of
them
and
the
defense
counsel
specifically
argued
to
them:
listen,
you've
got
to
look
at
the
whole
picture...
assumption
in
their
minds
in
drafting
the
rules,
do
you
think,
whether
you
term
it
as
a
form
of
reliability
inquiry
or
whatever?
there
is
nothing
that
i
would
call
legislative
debates
that
enlighten
the
question
beyond
what
the
framers
of
the
rule
decided
in
the
final
analysis
to
enact
as
the
rule.
and
therefore,
we
are
unable
to
move
away
from
what
the
final
rule
said.
the
only
evidence--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--the
only
explanation
they
give
is
an
explanation
in
the
advisory
committee
notes
that
i
think
is
a
hypothetical
right
out
of
this
case
wherein
they
say
that
there
would
be
certain
kinds
of
decisions
by
the
trial
judge
that
will
require
him
to
consider
the
statement
itself
to
assess
its
own
admissibility.
in
the
advisory
committee
notes,
of
course
they
don't
use
the
co-conspirator
exception.
they
use,
i
believe,
a
declaration
against
interest.
the
analysis,
however,
is
exactly
the
same.
there
are
simply
going
to
be
occasions
when
the
trial
judge
will
need
to
be
free
to
look
at
the
statement
itself
to
assess
is
own
admissibility.
the
only
evidence
there
is,
is
the
plain
meaning
of
the
rule
and
the
accompanying
advisory
committee
notes.
the
petitioner's
contention,
it
seems
to
me,
is
that
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
debates
of
an
affirmative
decision
to
abandon
a
particular
logic.
and
our
view,
i
guess,
is
simply
that
the
absence
of
any
legislative
debate
is
not
a
very
persuasive
reason
to
gainsay
the
plain
meaning
of
the
language
and
the
accompanying
advisory
committee
notes.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well,
there
is
no
question
that
the
more
evidence
you
have,
the
greater
your
confidence
that
it
is
good
evidence.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
sure.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
the
judge
ought
to
have
the
opportunity
to
look
at
the
statement
itself
as
part
of
all
the
evidence
in
the
case.
he
shouldn't
put
it
behind
door
number
3,
and
only
look
at
door
number
1.
we
are
not
contending
that
it's,
you
know,
a
good
idea
to
only
look
at
the
statement
itself
or
even
principally
the
statement
itself.
all
we
are
saying
is
that
it
is
a
bad
idea
to
ignore
the
statement
itself.
before
turning
to
the
confrontation
clause
issues,
i
would
like
to
make
one
further
point
about
the
rule
against
bootstrapping
and
that
is
this:
should
the
court
ultimately
decide
in
resolving
the
issues
in
this
case,
to
retain
the
language
in
glasser,
we
think
it
is
important
particularly
for
the
disposition
of
this
case
that
the
scope
of
the
glasser
rule
be
clarified.
there
is
in
the
lower
courts,
we
believe
today,
a
significant
degree
of
over-reading
of
the
rule
against
glasser.
some
courts
believe
that
the
rule
in
glasser
tells
you
that
you
take
the
statement
and
ignore
it
regardless
of
whether
it's
hearsay,
non-hearsay
or
subject
to
a
hearsay
exception,
and
that
is
not
the
rule.
this
court
in
deciding,
for
example
anderson
against
the
united
states,
recognized
that
very
often
co-conspirator
statements
have
non-hearsay
aspects.
and
our
contention
is
that
should
the
rule
in
glasser
be
reaffirmed
in
this
case
the
court,
in
deciding
this
case,
ought
at
a
minimum
to
clarify
the
scope
of
the
rule
to
make
clear
that
it
does
not
preclude
a
district
judge
from
considering
co-conspirator
statements
in
making
the
rule
801(d)(2)(e)
finding,
from
considering
those
statements
to
the
extent
that
they
are
non-hearsay
or
subject
to
a
hearsay
exception.
that
is
particularly
important
in
this
case
because
as
we
contend
in
our
brief,
virtually
every
statement
but
one
that
we
could
locate
in
the
case
that
was
urged
to
the
trial
judge
as
a
basis
for
making
his
finding
by
the
government,
only
one
statement
was
hearsay.
the
others
were
either
state-of-mind
evidence
or
not
offered
for
their
truth
or
in
the
nature
of
a
command
or,
in
one
respect
or
another,
non-hearsay.
so,
we
would
just
ask
that
the
rule,
if
it
is
to
be
retained,
be
clarified
to
that
extent.
we
believe
beyond
that,
of
course,
that
rule
104(a)
abolishes
the
rule
altogether.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
justice
stevens,
i
can
assure
you
that
it's
a
real
world
hypothetical
because--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--we
had
to
drop
some
cases
that
looked
a
lot
like
this
one.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
no,
they--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--they
tend
to
be
more,
you
know,
not
quite
as
spare
as
this
one,
but
that
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
there
is
evidence
that
is
lost
at
the
trial
court
level
that
doesn't
sort
of
percolate
up
through
the
system
and
find
its
way
into
f.
2d.
the
fact
remains
though
that
i
think
this
hypothetical
puts
sparely,
and
in
sort
of,
in
relief
the
kind
of
problem
that
in
perhaps
less
extravagant
ways
is
met
by
district
judges.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
suggest
that
i
could
have
deleted
the
"well-known
confederate"
characterization.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
i
am
advised...
reminded
by
my
colleague
that
one
of
the
reasons
you
might
not
find
cases
like
this
one
is
that
when
we
lose
them
we
can't
appeal.
the
fact
remains
that
this
hypothetical,
i
think
while
taking
a
strong...
you
know,
putting
the
issue
squarely,
nevertheless
enlightens
cases
that
are
different
from
it.
now,
i
have
spent,
i
notice,
a
good
portion
of
my
time
this
afternoon
devoted
to
issue
one,
and
that
is
because
it's
by
far
the
most
contested
issue
of
the
three
in
the
case.
i
should
not
wish,
however,
that
that
decision
about,
allocating
time,
to
suggest
that
the
government
believes
in
any
respect
that
issue
three,
this
independent
reliability
test,
is
somehow
less
important
to
the
day
to
day
practice
of
criminal
trials
because
nothing
could
be
further
from
the
truth.
our
view
is
that
opening
the
window
even
a
little
to
the
kind
of
separate
reliability
inquiry
that
petitioner
urges
in
this
case
would
impose
substantial
burdens
on
the
practice
of
criminal
law
while
promoting
almost
no
legitimate
aspects
that
are
intended
to
be
promoted
by
the
confrontation
clause.
our
contention
is
basically
this,
in
a
nutshell:
in
ohio
v.
roberts
this
court
said
that
a
statement
that
falls
within
a
firmly
rooted
hearsay
exception
is
reliable
without
more,
and
these
statements
are.
they
are
that
for
two
different
reasons:
first,
because
the
rule
801(d)(2)(e)
codifies
the
co-conspirator
exception
in
its
most
ancient
form.
it
is
in
fact
the
version
of
the
co-conspirator
exception
that
was
on
the
books
at
the
time
the
sixth
amendment
was
framed
and
ratified.
it
was
adopted
by
the
state
of
new
jersey,
for
example
in
the
very
year
that
the
sixth
amendment
was
ratified.
it
is
in
the
same
form
that
would
be
as
familiar
to
greenleaf
and
wigmore
as
it
is
to
professor
louisell
and
chief
judge
weinstein.
it
is
the
same
form
as
it
appeared
in
this
court's
gooding
decision,
the
first
decision
by
this
court
by
mr.
justice
story
adopting
the
co-conspirator
exception.
since,
as
this
court
noted
in
the
salinger
case,
the
confrontation
clause
is
intended
to
incorporate
the
common-law
meaning
of
confrontation,
together
with
all
its
historical
exceptions.
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
at
this
late
date,
exceptions
that
have
been
around
this
long
must
nevertheless
be
subject
to
an
independent
reliability
scrutiny.
there
is
a
second
reason,
however,
why
we
believe
the
co-conspirator
statements
admitted
under
the
rules
of
evidence
are
also
firmly
rooted,
and
that
is
because
the
requirements
of
the
rule
by
themselves
ensure
sufficient
reliability
to
send
the
statements
to
the
jury.
we
describe
in
our
brief
how
the
pendency
requirement,
the
in
furtherance
requirement,
the
proof
to
a
preponderance
standard
that
the
defendant
and
the
declarant
were
members
of
the
same
conspiracy,
all
tend
to
insure
reliability
to
a
sufficient
threshold
to
allow
the
jury
to
do
its
job
of
assessing
the
weight
of
that
evidence
which,
after
all,
is
the
jury's
function
and
not
the
trial
judge's
function.
now,
the
empirical
proof,
we
think,
that
rule
801(d)(2)(e)
is
doing
its
job
is
that
when
you
take
a
look
at
all
the
courts
of
appeals
that
insist
on
this
independent
reliability
inquiry,
not
a
one
of
them,
not
once,
has
been
able
to
conclude
that
a
statement
otherwise
admissible
under
rule
801(c)(2)(e)
is
nevertheless
not
sufficiently
reliable
to
meet
the
confrontation
clause
standard.
now,
we
put
that
challenge
to
petitioner
in
our
brief,
and
they
came
back
in
their
reply
brief
with
two
ninth
circuit
cases
that
they
say
go
the
other
way.
those
are
the
ordonez
case
and
the
mussin
case,
decided
by
the
ninth
circuit.
those
are
striking
counterexamples
because
in
point
of
fact,
in
both
cases
what
the
ninth
circuit
held
was
that
the
statement
did
not
satisfy
rule
801(a)(2)(e)
and
also
did
not
satisfy
the
confrontation
clause
and
that
shouldn't
surprise
anybody
because
the
exact,
same
analysis
that
accounts
for
the
failure
to
satisfy
the
rule
turns
out
to
be
the
same
analysis
that
accounts
for
not
passing
the
confrontation
clause.
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
the
third
question
presented?
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
well--
mr.
lawrence
s.
robbins
--well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
this
case
the
sixth
circuit
held
that
no
independent
reliability
inquiry
was
required
in
light
of
the
statements
falling
within
the
ohio
v.
roberts
language,
and
so
wee
believe
that
the
question
is
presented...
we
think
that
whether
the
confrontation
clause
does
or
does
not
require
it,
these
statements
met
the
test.
the
point
is,
they
always
meet
the
test
and
the
only
time
they
don't
meet
the
test
is
when
they
also
don't
meet
the
rule,
and
that's
the
empirical
evidence
from
the
circuits
that
have
grappled
with
this
test.
and
of
course,
grappling
with
the
test
is
one
of
the
problems
with
the
test
itself
because
the
fact
of
the
matter
is,
as
this
court
noted
in
inadi,
in
rejecting
the
independent
availability
tests
that
what
it
does
is,
it
overlays
the
system
with
yet
another
round
of
appellate
inquiry
and
trial
court
inquiry.
it
turns
out
that
this
independent
reliability
test
imposes
these
costs
at
no
apparent
gain
to
defendants
because
defendants
keep
losing
them.
the
reason
they
keep
losing
them
is
that
it
just
reformulates
801(d)(2)(e)
with
a
confrontation
clause
label.
there
is
no
reason
to
indulge
in
this
kind
of
wheel
spinning
with
so
little
apparent
gain.
there
is
also
no
reason
to
think
that
this
can
be
cabined
as
narrowly
as
petitioner
believes.
if
the
rule
is
that
it
can
only
come
up
when
the
defense
lawyer
makes
the
objection,
says
the
statements
are
crucial
and
unreliable,
it
is
a
safe
bet
it
will
happen
every
day
and
given
that
there
is
no
apparent
benefit
from
it
to
defendants,
it
can't
be
that
the
confrontation
clause
requires
the
system
to
absorb
it.
in
conclusion,
it
seems
to
us
that
one
overarching
principle
has
guided
the
framers
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
and
that
principle
is
stated
in
402:
all
relevant
evidence
is
admissible.
in
urging
this
court
this
afternoon
to
reject
the
bootstrapping
rule
and
to
reject
an
independent
reliability
test
for
admissible
co-conspirator
statements,
we
believe
that
we
are
being
most
faithful
to
that
presumption
of
admissibility.
we
free
the
trial
judge
to
look
at
all
non-privileged
items
and
by
so
doing
allow
him
to
send
relevant
evidence
to
the
jury
without
the
encumbrance
of
an
exclusionary
rule
that
is
no
longer
fit
to
this
system.
by
rejecting
a
redundant
test
for
the
reliability
of
otherwise
admissible
statements
we
leave
to
the
jury
its
traditional
function
of
examining
all
relevant
evidence
and
separating
for
itself
the
wheat
from
the
chaff.
we
believe
that
when
judge
and
jury
perform
their
assigned
functions,
the
rules
of
evidence
function
as
they
were
expected
to
by
their
framers.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
