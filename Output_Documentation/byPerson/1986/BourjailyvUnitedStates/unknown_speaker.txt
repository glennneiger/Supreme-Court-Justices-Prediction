unknown
speaker
the
parties
agree
on
the
second
issue,
don't
they?
unknown
speaker
i
suggest
that
is
a
good
idea.
unknown
speaker
well,
that
may
have
been
the
universal
rule
with
respect
to
proving
agency,
but
what
was
the
basis
for
the
rule?
unknown
speaker
is
it
usually
an
agent
suing
a
principal
and
you
didn't
want
to
rely
on
just
the
agent's
statement,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
because
they
thought
what,
that
the
agent,
wasn't
reliable,
or
what?
unknown
speaker
but
there
were
changes
in
the
whole
system
wrought
by
these
rules,
weren't
there,
the
confiding
to
the
judge
of
the
primary
responsibility
for
making
the
factual
findings
that,
would
support
admission?
unknown
speaker
and
that
he
had
to
find,
himself,
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence...
i
didn't
realize
it
was
that
clearly
spelled
out
at
all
in
the
evidence
cases.
unknown
speaker
the
government
says...
government
seems
to
indicate
that
under
the
prior
rule
admissibility
was
left
to
the
jury?
unknown
speaker
but
wasn't
it
true
that
in
many
cases
before
the
rules,
a
trial
judge
thought
with
guidance
from
appellant
opinion
so
that...
that
all
he
had
to
say
was,
"there's
enough
evidence
here
to
support
a
finding."
he
didn't
have
to
make
a
finding
himself.
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you...
actually
i
have
two
questions,
mr.
salzburg.
first,
does
it
make
any
difference
in
your
view
whether
the
statement
that
is
being
challenged
was
made
in
the
presence
of
the
defendant
who
is
objecting
to
its
use?
there
is
some
language
in
the
case
that
seems
to
make
that
important
in
some
situations.
justice
stevens,
let
me
answer
that.
it
might
indeed
make
a
difference
in
at
least
two
ways,
and
i
think
there
is
not
a
disagreement
among
the
parties
about
this,
although
it
might
appear
that
there
is.
first,
if
a
statement
were
made
within
the
hearing
of
a
defendant,
the
statement
were
made
by
a
co-defendant,
that
fact
itself
would
be
not
hearsay
for
purposes
of
evaluating
what
was
going
on,
what
the
defendant
knew
or
should
have
known,
and
would
be
independent
evidence.
the
fact
that
such
a
statement
were
made
and
heard,
independent
of
the
truth,
if
it
involved
any
kind
of
accusation
of
wrongdoing,
an
independent
rules
of
evidence,
the
adoptive
admission
rule
which
is
codified
as
rule
801(d)(2)(b),
might
come
into
play
too
and
might
provide
an
independent
basis
for
admitting
such
a
statement
against
the
non-speaking
defendant.
i
think
there
is
no
disagreement
about
that.
to
go
further,
we
do
not
contend
that
in
evaluating
the
independent
evidence,
the
trial
judge
may
not
consider
other
hearsay.
he
may.
the
independent
evidence
requirement--
--on
that
point,
that
is
really
the
second
thing
i
was
going
to
ask
you.
is
there
not
a
distinction
in
some
of
the
cases
at
least
between
the
statement
that,
"there
must
be
independent
evidence
of
the
relationship."
or
you
say,
"the
independent
evidence
itself
must
be
the
only
evidence
that
can
be
used
to
meet
the
preponderance
test?"
in
other
words,
one
might,
say,
"the
independent
evidence
plus
the
declarations
themselves
have
to
establish
a
preponderance."
or
one
could
say,
"the
preponderance
has
to
apply
only
to
the
independent
evidence."
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question
since
i
have
interrupted
you
so
much
already.
it
seems
to
me
that
to
use
the
preponderance
standard
is
a
little
bit
misleading
anyway
because
you're
looking
at
the
evidence
that
has
been
offered
by
the
prosecution.
i
take
it
the
judge
makes
his
ruling
when
the
government
resist
at
which
time
the
defense
has
not
yet
put
any
evidence
in.
so,
it
would
seem
to
me
that
in
almost
every
case
whatever
evidence
is
in
the
record
is
going
to
outweigh
nothing
and
therefore
you
will
always
meet
the
preponderance
standard.
it's
not
really,
in
practical
effect,
much
different
than
sufficient
evidence
to
make
out
a
prima
facie
case.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
you
won't
have
a
full
hearing
on
whether
there
was
a
conspiracy.
unknown
speaker
mr.
saltzburg,
you
haven't
yet
told
us
what
you
think
the
language
of
the
rule
means
in
making
its
determination,
"its"
referring
to
the
court,
"it
is
not
bound
by
the
rules
of
evidence
except
those
with
respect
to
privileges."
unknown
speaker
we
didn't
say
that
the
rules
don't
mean
what
they
say
either,
in
that
case.
unknown
speaker
but
this
says,
you
know,
it
says...
the
whole
rule
says,
preliminary
questions
about
the
admissibility
of
evidence.
it's
quite
sweeping,
and
in
making
the
determination
as
to
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
the
court
isn't
bound
by
the
rules
of
evidence.
unknown
speaker
how
much
do
you
really
lose
if
that
point
is
decided
against
you?
i
mean,
a
trial
judge
can
still
say
that
a
lot
of
these
unsupported
declarations
are
not
trustworthy,
and
he
can
reject
them
for
that
reason.
unknown
speaker
as
the
government
asked
in
its
brief,
mr.
saltzburg,
can
you
imagine
any
counsel
for
criminal
defendant
who
wouldn't
make
that
argument
with
regard
to
any
testimony
by
a
co-conspirator?
unknown
speaker
the
rule
would
have
been
against
them.
i
mean,
they
would
lose
that
under
the
existing
law?
unknown
speaker
exactly.
unknown
speaker
only
relatively
recently.
unknown
speaker
i
guess
i
am
getting
old.
dutton
isn't
so
old.
unknown
speaker
when
you
say
the
bootstrap
rules
contended
for
by
petitioners,
as
you
understand,
is
that
the
independent
evidence
has
to
satisfy
the
preponderance
standing
by
itself?
unknown
speaker
under
existing
law
do
you
think
the
tape
without
the
corroborative
evidence
could
come
in?
unknown
speaker
you
are
saying,
then
there
need
not
be
any
independent
corroborative
evidence?
unknown
speaker
the
judge,
can
he
ever
exclude
it?
unknown
speaker
then
it
doesn't
prove
a
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
so,
it's
what,
excluded?
unknown
speaker
it
is
excluded
for
proving
a
conspiracy?
unknown
speaker
but
now,
can
the
trial
judge,
listening
to
that
tape
say,
"i
know
the
seller
said
that
but
i
simply
don't
believe
the
seller?"
unknown
speaker
now,
under
the
old
rules
i'm
sure
that
the
trial
judge
had
to
accept
the
prima
facie
case
analysis.
in
other
words,
he
couldn't
find
credibility
but
you
say
now
that
it's
entirely
up
to
the
judge,
the
judge
can
make
a
credibility
finding
just
on
a
tape?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
think
that's
inconsistent
with
anything
that
mr.
saltzburg
said.
he
didn't
deny
that
the
jury's
was
the
final
word.
he
asserted
that
there
was
a
prior
word
by
the
judge,
however.
unknown
speaker
and
it's
just
your
impression?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
mean
to
say
that
the
judge
would
just
willy-nilly
let
everything
in
and
then
instruct
the
jury
on
what
to
disregard?
unknown
speaker
he
certainly
screened
some
of
the
evidence
in
conspiracy
trials;
you
agree
to
that,
don't
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
they
were
required
to,
weren't
they?
if
it
was
perfectly
obvious
that
a
statement
was
hearsay,
it
couldn't...
you'd
just
leave
it
up
to
the
jury?
i'm
sorry.
you
go
ahead
and
make
your
argument.
unknown
speaker
that
doesn't
mean
there
was
no
preliminary
screening
by
the
trial
judge.
unknown
speaker
but
that
doesn't
make
a
lot
of
difference,
really,
if
the
judge
let's
it
in
and
just,
you
know,
in
charge
number
26
in
a
long
list
of
items,
the
jury
is
told
they
can
use
it
or
not
use
it,
the
chances
are
the
jury
is
going
to
use
it.
i
mean,
a
defendant
would
much
rather
have
it
kept
out
by
the
judge
than
submitted
to
the
jury,
i
think.
unknown
speaker
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense.
i
can
entirely
understand
how
that
could
be
a
good
explanation
of
bootstrapping
that
would
render
it
inapplicable
to
the
new
situation
with
the
new
rule.
but
what
the
other
side
says
is
that
in
fact
it
wasn't
only
the
jury
making
the
determination.
it
was
the
judge
making
a
determination
and
the
judge
also
was
applying
the
rule
of
the
necessity
of
extrinsic
evidence.
that
can't
explain...
that
wouldn't
be
changed
by
the
new
rule.
unknown
speaker
all
right.
but
now,
you
are
just
relying
on
the
language
of
the
rule
and
you
are
not
relying
upon
a
rationale
as
to
why
things
should
change.
your
rationale
was,
took
the
rule
has
taken
the
call
away
from
the
jury
and
given
it
to
the
judge.
that
explains
why
the
clear
words
of
the
rule
mean
what
they
say.
but
once
you
concede...
which
you
haven't
conceded,
but
if
it
is
conceded
that
the
judge
used
to
make
that
determination
himself,
then
you
are
just
left
with
no
explanation
for
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
other
than
the
plain
language.
now,
maybe
that
is
enough,
but
it
would
help
to
have
an
explanation
for
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
rules...
isn't
the
judge
to
be
bound
by
the
rules
of
evidence?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
judge,
you
say,
isn't
bound
by
the
rules
of
evidence.
what
rules
of
evidence,
the
printed
rules
of
evidence,
the
code
of
evidence,
the
code
of
which
rule
104
is
part?
unknown
speaker
mr.
robbins,
are
you
going
to
get
to
judge
friendly's
opinion
in
u.s.
against
gainey,
or
whatever
that
name
is?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
have
any
trouble
with
it?
unknown
speaker
would
we
expect
to
see
in
the
explanation
of
the
rule
an
indication
of
change
if
they
had
intended
a
change?
unknown
speaker
in
some
cases
would
you
concede
that
evidence
of...
independent
evidence
of
the
existence
of
the
conspiracy
would
enhance
reliability?
unknown
speaker
you
would
concede
more
than
that,
i
hope.
i
hope
you
concede
that
in
some
cases
you
couldn't
get
it
in
unless
there
were
independent
evidence
because
on
its
own
race
it's
just
not
enough?
unknown
speaker
may
i
ask
you,
going
back
to
your
original
hypothetical,
you
started
out
with
a
constructed
hypothetical.
are
there
any
recorded
cases
that
you
could
cite
to
me
that
contain
as
persuasive
a
hypothetical
as
you
are
able
to
imagine,
because
i
am
wondering
if
we
are
in
the
real
world
or
are
we
in
a
classroom
where
you
use
a
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
then
the
71--
unknown
speaker
--i
see.
unknown
speaker
you
can't
cite
me
any
litigated
cases?
unknown
speaker
because
your
hypothetical
included
things
like,
he
was
a
well
known
associate
and
so
forth,
which
i
suppose
had
to
be
established
by
independent
evidence,
you
had
a
little
independent
evidence
that
itself
was
fairly
persuasive
in
your
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
and
then
made
it
even
harder
to
find
the
case
in
the
reported
decisions.
it
would
be
like...
i
am
just
saying,
if
the
answer
is
no
you
can't
give
me
a
citation
of
one
just
like
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
robbins,
can
we
rule
with
you
without
getting
into
that
at
all?
i
mean,
you
are
challenging
the
answer.
we
don't
need
that,
do
we,
for
your
argument?
unknown
speaker
yes.
do
we
need
it?
unknown
speaker
if
you
say
so,
go
ahead.
unknown
speaker
maybe
that's
wrong.
