mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
william
bourjaily
was
arrested
by
the
fbi
on
may
25th,
1984,
approximately
a
kilogram
of
cocaine
was
found
in
his
car
along
with
a
large
quantity
of
money.
the
united
states
subsequently
filed
charges
against
mr.
bourjaily,
a
co-defendant,
angelo
lonarco,
and
mr.
bourjaily
was
convicted
of
conspiracy
and
of
possession
of
cocaine
with
the
intent
to
distribute
in
federal
district
court.
on
appeal
his
conviction
was
affirmed,
the
court
of
appeals
holding,
according
to
the
authority
of
the
sixth
circuit,
that
the
trial
judge
properly
admitted
co-conspirator
statements
by
lonardo
against
bourjaily.
this
court
subsequently
granted
petition
for
certiorari
limited
to
three
questions:
one,
is
it
required
by
federal
rules
of
evidence
that
a
trial
judge
determine,
on
the
basis
of
independent
evidence,
that
there
was
a
conspiracy
that
existed
that
included
both
a
declarant
and
a
co-defendant
against
whom
conspirator
statements
are
offered.
two,
assuming
that
such
a
finding
must
be
made,
what
quantum
of
evidence
is
required
to
support
the
finding;
and
three,
is
there
a
requirement
that
the
trial
judge
make
an
independent
evaluation
of
reliability,
an
issue
that
the
parties
in
this
case
have
treated
as
raising
a
confrontation
question.
the
first
two
issues
upon
which
the
court
has
granted
review
involve,
of
course,
not
the
constitution,
at
least
not
directly.
those
issues
involve
the
interpretation
of
a
statute.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
yes,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
do.
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence...
and
it
was
my
intent
not
to
argue
that
unless
the
court
had
questions
about
it.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
thank
you.
the
first
issue
in
the
case,
whether
or
not
there
must
be
independent
evidence
of
conspiracy
and
of
participation
by
the
declarant
and
the
defendant
is
an
issue
that
involves
a
statute,
as
i
have
said,
a
statute
because
congress
affirmatively
enacted
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
into
law,
signed
by
the
president,
after
they
were
submitted
by
this
court.
the
third
question
in
the
case,
the
reliability
question,
involves
not
the
statute
but
a
question
of
whether
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
imposes
an
obligation
in
addition
to
any
that
this
court
might
find
imposed
by
the
federal
rules
of
evidence.
the
key
provisions,
and
the
parties
agree
on
this,
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
are
two:
rules
104(a).
a
rule
which
talks
about
the
trial
judge's
determining
the
admissibility
of
evidence,
and
rule
1101(d)(1)
which
again
has
similar
language
about
what
the
trial
judge
does
when
making
preliminary
determinations
of
fact.
it
is
without
doubt
because
it
is
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
that...
of
both
rules,
excuse
me...
that
both
indicate
that
in
making
determinations
on
evidence
questions
the
trial
judge
is
not
bound
by
the
rules
of
evidence.
thus,
the
first
issue
is
whether
that
means
that
there
is
no
requirement
of
independent
evidence
to
support
the
admissibility
of
co-conspirator
statements.
it
is
important,
we
feel,
for
the
court
to
examine
the
state
of
the
law
prior
to
and
during
this
court's
consideration
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
the
drafts,
and
the
congress's
evaluation
of
those
rules.
prior
to
1972,
november,
when
this
court
approved
a
version
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
it
was
unanimously
agreed
throughout
the
united
states
in
federal
courts
and
in
state
courts
that
independent
evidence,
proof
aliunde,
in
the
words
of
this
court
in
glasser,
was
one
of
the
fundamental
requirements
for
introducing
co-conspirator
statements,
or
for
that
matter,
vicarious
statements
generally
in
both
civil
and
criminal
cases.
the
principle
that
the
courts
had
adopted
was
that
these
statements,
when
admitted,
rely
more
on
an
agency
analysis
than
on
a
liability
analysis,
and
that
traditional
agency
law
said
agency
may
not
be
proved
from
the
mouth
of
the
agent.
independent
or
other
evidence,
as
the
american
law
institute
said
in
its
second
version
of
the
restatement
of
the
law
of
agency,
other
evidence
must
be
provided.
during
the
time
this
court
considered
the
proposed
federal
rules
of
evidence...
excuse
me,
mr.
justice.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i
believe--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--in
some
cases
that
would
be
true.
in
other
cases,
i
think
the
vast
bulk
of
the
cases,
involve
third
parties
suing
employers,
and
involved
in
the
criminal
area,
suits
against
or
prosecutions
against
persons
other
than
persons
who
made
statements,
and
in
both
sets
of
cases
the
courts
adopted
a
principle
that
it
would
be
too
easy
to
have
agents
essentially
create
liability
for
others
by
making
statements
that
others
were
responsible
for
what
the
agents
did.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i
think
that
in
part,
justice
white,
that's
exactly
right,
that
people
generally
have
incentives
in
a
number
of
situations
to
claim
to
be
acting
on
behalf
of
or
in
conjunction
with
others,
and
that
when
the
others
are
called
upon
to
account
there
ought
to
be
some
better
basis,
at
least
a
minimal
basis,
that
is,
some
independent
evidence
sufficient
to
give
us
confidence
that
the
statement
by
the
agent
ought
indeed
be
used
to
impose
liability
upon
the
principal.
that,
i
believe
is
the
basis...
i
think
in
the
criminal
cases
there
was,
of
course,
always
lurking
in
the
background
a
sense
that
maybe
the
constitution
itself
eight
have
something
to
say
about
that.
that
question
did
not
have
to
be
a
directly
addressed
very
often
because
the
courts
were
in
fact
unanimous
on
the
independent
evidence
requirement.
during
the
entire
period
this
court
considered
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
or
more
accurately
the
judicial
conference
did,
and
submitted
them
to
this
court
and
during
the
three
years
between
1972
and
1975,
from
the
time
they
were
submitted
by
chief
justice
burger
on
behalf
of
the
court
to
the
congress,
no
one
at
any
point
suggested,
in
legal
literature,
in
letters
to
the
judicial
conference,
in
testimony
concerning
the
rules,
in
any
way,
shape
or
form
that
the
proposed
federal
rule
104(a)
in
conjunction
with
the
conspirators'
rule
which
is
rule
801(d)(2)(e),
was
intended
to
change
what
had
been
viewed
as
a
standard
part
of
american
law.
indeed,
the
assumption
was
to
the
contrary.
while
it
is
fair
to
say
that
the
rule
did
not...
that
the
co-conspirators
exception
itself
did
not
receive
great
consideration
by
the
congress,
each
time
it
was
mentioned
the
mentioners
indicated
their
assumption
that
it
remained
unchanged
by
the
federal
rules.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
chief
justice
rehnquist,
in
fact
the
rule
104(a)
was
deemed
by
the
advisory
committee
when
it
submitted
to
this
court
to
be
a
codification
of
the
orthodox,
traditional,
well-understood
view
that
the
trial
judge
made
the
rulings
and
the
findings
on
evidence
questions.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i
have
confidence
in
this
statement,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
in
fact
the
cases
were
clear
that
the
function
was
the
trial
judge's
to
determine
the
admissibility
of
the
evidence,
but
there
was
in
fact
some
confusion
as
to
whether
the
judge
had
to
say
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
whether
he
could
say,
"i
have
reviewed
the
independent
evidence
and
i
find
that
it
satisfies
a
prima
facie
standard."
the
confusion
was--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--justice
white,
if
the
government
is
correct
about
that,
i
am
wrong
and
i
am
wrong
in
a
fundamental
way.
the
cases
do
not
support
it
and
there
is
no
citation
of
authority
in
the
government's
brief
that
will
support
that.
indeed
the
cases,
the
key
cases,
the
one
most
often
cited
again
and
again,
judge
hand's
opinion
in
dennis
and
the
carbo
case,
say
the
opposite.
it
is
true,
and
this
has
been
well
understood
that
in
a
number
of
areas
trial
judges
resubmitted
the
issue
to
jury.
they
were
concerned
so
much
about
the
danger
of
this
testimony.
they
gave
the
defendant
a
second
bite.
that
second
bite
as
read
by
the
government
is
to
be
taken
away
under
its
approach
along
with
the
traditional
rule
that
the
judge
is
a
screener.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
there
were
cases
in
which
trial
judges
said
that,
"i've
iooked
at
the
evidence;
there's
enough
independent
evidence
here
so
i
will
let
it
in."
"then
i'll
instruct
the
jury."
they
usually
gave
that
instruction
to
the
jury
about
finding
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
that
they
believed
the
conspiracy
existed
and
that
the
people
were
members...
before
relying
on
the
statements.
there
were
a
number
of
appellate
decisions
saying
that
was
simply
wrong
but
that
it
may
have
provided
the
defendant
with
more
protection
than
the
preponderance
standard
would
have.
judge
friendly
in
an
oft-cited
case
once
wrote
that
if
the
trial
judge
is
essentially
saying,
"i've
got
to
be
satisfied,
you
could
find
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
here."
that
may
be
higher
and
more
protection.
but
until
this
case
the
suggestion
was
never
made
that
you
would
do
away
with
that
protection
and
at
the
same
time
do
away
with
the
independent
evidence
rule.
the
cases
before,
during
and
after,
with
the
exception
of
two
circuits,
the
adoption
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
unanimously
agreed
that
independent
evidence
was
basically
at
the
heart
of
the
offering
of
one
person's
statements
against
the
other.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
the
traditional
rule,
justice
stevens,
was
the
independent
evidence
had
to
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
the
trial
judge
that
the
co-conspirator
statement
should
be
admitted.
the
first
exception
to
that
was
the
first
circuit's
opinion
which
is
cited
in
the
briefs
in
united
states
versus
martorano.
i
would
note
that
the
first
circuit
made
its
suggestion
that
maybe
rule
104(a)
changed
things,
in
a
single
paragraph.
it
did
not
examine
the
legislative
history.
it
is
not
even
clear
whether
the
issue
was
an
aside
or
whether
it
was
fully
briefed
by
the
parties.
no
other
court
picked
up
on
that
but
the
sixth
circuit
in
a
decision
in
the
first
case
where
it
looked
at
the
issue,
united
states
versus
enright,
in
which
the
issue
was
not
before
it
but
in
dictum,
in
a
footnote
number
4,
the
court
added,
"we
note
that
the
first
circuit
has
said
rule
104(a)
appears
to
change
things."
"it
might,
but
we
don't
decide
it."
the
next
time
the
sixth
circuit
took
up
the
issue
in
vincent,
the
very
next
case,
it
decided
that
it
had
indeed
determined
in
the
footnote
that
it
was
bound
to
read
rule
104(a)
as
the
first
circuit
had.
since
then
no
other
circuit
has
since
read
the
rule
104(a)
as
the
first
circuit
had.
indeed,
the
first
circuit
was...
in
that
one
paragraph
said,
"we
don't
like
this."
"we
feel
bound
by
104(a)."
"you
look
at
it."
"it
seems
to
bind
us."
and
because
of
this
court's
opinion
in
glasser
the
court
said,
"we
basically
tell
trial
judges
you
shouldn't
give
hardly
any
weight
to
the
contents
of
the
statements
but
we
feel
constrained
to
say
they
shouldn't
be
excluded
altogether."
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
if
i
could
respond
to
that,
i
think
that
is
not
quite
correct.
could
i
tell
you
what
i
think
the
courts
are
actually
doing,
almost
unanimously
on
that?
prior
to
the
federal
rules,
and
indeed
after
they
were
adopted,
it
was
well
understood
that
it
someone
objected
to
any
kind
of
hearsay
coming
in,
declaration
against
interest,
the
co-conspirator
statement,
that
in
theory
the
objecting
party
was
entitled
before
the
judge
ruled
to
both
have
the
party
who
offered
the
evidence
to
put
on
evidence
to
say
it
satisfied
the
rule
and
the
objecting
party
put
on
evidence
to
show
that
it
didn't
satisfy
the
rule.
indeed,
that
is
exactly
what
is
done
in
some
cases.
that
is
what
is
done
when
confessions,
of
course,
are
offered
and
motions
to
suppress
are
made,
and
there
are
factual
disputes.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
that
is
what
i
was
about
to
say.
the
court
said
that
would
involve
perhaps
trying
the
case
within
a
case.
what
the
courts
have
done
in
this,
i
think
is
perfectly
consistent
with
the
prior
practice.
they
have
said
the
trial
judge
shall
make
a
preliminary
ruling
at
the
end
of
the
government's
case,
just
as
you
have
indicated.
is
the
trial
judge
persuaded
at
this
point
by
a
preponderance
of
the
evidence,
and
indeed
often
will
entertain
offers
of
proof
by
the
defendant,
offers
to
decide
whether
or
not
some
kind
of
a
hearing
ought
to
be
held
even
before
the
trial
goes
on.
the
defendant
will
then
have
a
chance
to
put
on
evidence
and
is
entitled
to
ask
the
trial
judge
to
reconsider
the
preponderance
ruling
in
the
close
of
the
evidence,
and
indeed
the
circuits
are
in
agreement
that
indeed
the
trial
judge
must
at
that
point
reconsider
because
that
would
be
the
only
chance
of
giving
the
defense
a
fair
opportunity
to
be
heard
on
the
evidence
question.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
i
think
that
if
there
were
no
history
and
no
background
to
this
rule
and
we
looked
at
that,
i
would
say
that
there
is
no
independent
evidence
requirement.
i
would
note,
however,
that
this
court
has
already
acknowledged
in
the
case...
i
think
you,
in
fact
wrote
the
case.
it
was
called
united
states
versus
able
that
involved
biased
impeachment,
decided
in
september
of
1984,
that
the
federal
rules
of
evidence
didn't
include...
it
wasn't
like
an
internal
revenue
code,
it
didn't
include
all
of
the
rules.
indeed,
it
is
clear
from
the
background
that
certain
interstitial
aspects
of
the
rules
were
going
to
have
to
be
filled
out.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
no,
i
think
there
is
a
reading,
and
we
have
tried
to
supply
it
in
the
brief,
of
rule
801(d)(2)(e)
which...
it
assumes,
we
believe,
that
the
judge
will
have
found
conspiracy
and
it
doesn't
say
how.
indeed,
none
of
the
rules
of
evidence
speak
to
what
standard
the
trial
judge
should
use,
preponderance
or
any
other,
for
making
any
evidence
ruling.
apparently
the
drafters
assume
that
would
be
carried
forward
under
prior
law,
and
our
argument
is
everyone
assumes,
and
indeed
that
was
going
to
be
the
case
with
co-conspirator
statements.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
it
is
very
broad
language
and,
mr.
chief
justice,
we
urge
upon
this
court
a
very
small
point
which
is
that
it
certainly
is
reasonable
to
assume
that
the
drafters
may
have
in
fact
viewed
the
conspiracy,
the
independent
proof
requirement,
as
a
basic
agency
principle,
almost
a
substantive
principle.
--indeed,
that's
what
it
is
in
many
civil
cases...
and
didn't
take
the
time
to
look
and
never
considered
the
point.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
i'd
like
to
say
that
we...
and
mr.
bourjaily
because
"we"
in
this
case
is
every
defendant
who
will
subsequently
go
on
trial.
we
believe
it
is
so
important
that
it
would
be
better
for
this
court
to
hold
that
as
long
as
the
independent
evidence
requirement
is
strictly
enforced,
and
as
long
as
the
preponderance
of
the
evidence
standard
is
used,
that
no
confrontation
clause
analysis
ought
to
be
employed.
it
is
that
important
for,
if
i
may
give
an
example,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
that
there
is
certain
circumstantial
evidence
that
is
highly
incriminating
against
mr.
bourjaily,
he
is
found
with
a
kilo
of
cocaine
in
his
car
in
a
parking
lot.
but
there
is
also
no
doubt
that
the
bulk
of
the
evidence
in
this
case
involved
taped
conversations
that
didn't
include
him,
that
didn't
mention
him,
that
simply
made
reference
to
vague
"others".
had,
in
this
case...
had
mr.
bourjaily
pulled
into
that
parking
lot
and
seen
his
friend
lonardo
truly
in
an
innocent,
fashion
anti
gone
up
and
embraced
lonardo,
very
well
might
have
been
enough
for
a
trial
judge
to
say,
"we'll
let
in
the
statements".
now,
you
may
fairly
say
to
me,
"do
we
know
that
a
trial
judge
would
do
that?"
and
my
answer,
fairly,
is
"no".
i
do
not
know
that
a
trial
judge
would
but
i
do
know
from
the
decided
opinions
if
a
trial
judge
did,
the
court
of
appeals
would
view
that
as
within
the
permissible
range
of
fact
finding
by
the
court.
it
is
that
important.
that
is
why,
at
the
risk
of
losing
time
on
the
confrontation
argument,
i
stand
here
and
say
that
in
the
view
of
many
this
issue
of
whether
the
independent
evidence
requirement
will
be
removed
is
of
such
substance
that
it
is
not
conceivable
it
would
have
been
decided
by
silence
in
the
course
of
an
amendment
process
where
all
assumed
the
opposite
to
be
true.
but
i
would
move
to
the
confrontation
clause
issue
next
unless
the
court
has
further
questions
on
the
evidence
issue.
an
amicus
brief
has
been
filed
before
this
court
by
the
national
association
of
criminal
defense
lawyers,
and
it
urges
that
in
all
cases,
because
agency
law
doesn't
involve
reliability,
but
in
all
cases
in
which
conspirator
statements
are
offered
the
trial
judge
should
engage
in
an
independent
inquiry
into
reliability.
the
government
says
in
no
cases,
ever,
under
any
circumstances
no
matter
what
the
case
may
look
like,
should
a
trial
judge
be
permitted
to
engage
in
a
confrontation
inquiry.
in
the
brief
filed
last
term
by
the
government
in
the
inadi
case,
the
government
didn't
say
that
the
rule
should
be
never.
the
government
referred
to
a
presumption
of
constitutionality
for
long
standing,
well
established,
firmly
rooted,
one
of
those
terms,
hearsay
exceptions.
this
court
used
similar
language
to
that
in
ohio
v.
roberts,
and
indeed
i
think
it's
not
unfair
to
say
that
some
of
justice
stewart's
plurality
opinion
for
the
court
in
dutton
v.
evans,
used
similar
language
in
saying
that
there
must
be
some
point
at
which
you
stop
repeating
every
evidence
argument
in
the
form
of
a
constitutional
debate.
that,
to
us,
is
persuasive.
indeed,
the
cases
show
that
where
defendants
do
no
more
than
say,
"this
is
a
co-conspirator
statement;
should
therefore
violate
the
confrontation
clause."
the
courts
have
paid
little
heed
to
such
claims.
it
is
our
position
that
they
should
continue
to
basically
treat
such
claims
as
being
frivolous.
but
we
believe
that
dutton
v.
evans,
the
case
in
which
this
court
addressed
the
georgia
rule,
signifies
something
important
which
is,
the
co-conspirators
rule
has
changed
over
time.
the
rule
the
government
describes
as
originating
in
england
in
the
1600's
to
this
court
in
inadi
is
not
the
rule
that
is
used
day
in,
day
out
by
state
and
federal
courts
that
have
the
federal
rules
or
similar
rules.
the
co-conspirators
rule,
and
the
very
doctrine
of
conspiracy
even
in
the
way
in
which
it
may
not
in
some
instances
even
require
overt
act
proof,
is
very
different
now
than
it
once
was
and
it
may
continue
to
change.
our
position
is
that
indeed,
presumptively,
any
statement
which
would
be
supported
by
independent
evidence
so
that
a
trial
judge
finds
by
a
preponderance
of
independent
evidence
there
was
a
conspiracy,
the
declarant
was
a
member,
the
defendant
against
whom
it
was
offered
was
a
member,
should
be
admitted
and
the
confrontation
clause
would
not
be
violated.
but
that
a
defendant
who
was
prepared
with
specificity,
with
clarity
to
say
to
a
district
judge
or
to
a
state
trial
judge,
this
evidence
is
critical
in
this
case,
it
is
a
rare
kind
of
evidence
in
which
most
of
the
assumptions
that
have
been
made
about
co-conspirator
statements
like
this
court
discussed
in
inadi,
recent
memory,
it's
a
statement
that
goes
back
in
time
and
distance
by
a
co-defendant
who
has
perhaps
a
motive
because
he
knew
the
government
was
investigating,
who
is
out
to
shift
blame.
that
at
some
point
to
say
that,
no
matter
how
bad
the
circumstances
are,
that
the
judge
wouldn't
look,
is
wrong.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
justice
scalia,
a
fair
answer
to
that
is...
i
have
examined
the
cases
aria
many
are
cited
to
this
court.
very
few
criminal
defense
lawyers,
no
matter
how
able,
have
been
able
to
say
very
much
about
co-conspirator
statements
in
the
vast
run
of
cases
other
than,
they
don't
like
them
because
they're
out
of
court
statements
by
co-conspirators.
they
have
not
sought,
nor
do
i
believe
they
could
in
the
typical
conspiracy
case,
seek
to
make
the
kind
of
foundation
that
i
have
just
described.
now,
if
you
says
but
won't
they
strain...
i
am
sorry,
justice
white?
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
if
they
had
tried
in
some
of
the
circuits,
no
mariner
what
they
said
they
were
basically
out
of
luck.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
that
is
true.
in
other
circuits
the
courts
said,
we
don't
think
the
case--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--well,
we
would
quarrel
with
the
government
on
that,
justice
white.
after
dutton,
most
courts
assumed
because
this
court
entertained
the
confrontation
attack
in
dutton.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
there
was
a
long
hiatus
between
dutton
and
this
court
in
ohio
versus
roberts,
and
during
that
decade
many
courts
assumed
that
when
this
court
looked
at
the
confrontation
analysis
in
dutton,
it
should
look...
i
think
that
justice
blackmun's
opinion
in
ohio
versus
roberts
when
talking
about
firmly
rooted
exceptions
did
cause
some
courts
to
say,
"we
need
not
look
as
hard."
that
is
our
position.
it
is
simply,
to
borrow
a
phrase
from
a
movie,
never
say
never,
and
that's
not
a
lot
to
leave
open,
we
submit.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
two
points,
if
it
please
the
court.
number
one,
justice
o'connor,
you
asked
a
question
about
how
this
court
should
go
about
interpreting
rules
when
there
is
silence
and
i
would
address,
if
i
might,
there
are
three
examples
of
cases
i
would
like
to
cite
that
are
not
in
the
briefs
but
i
think
it
would,
if
i
may
make
reference
to
them,
might
enlighten
the
answer
to
your
question.
the
government,
the
united
states,
has
argued
that,
let
the
relevant
evidence
come
in,
let
silence
be
disregarded,
when
it
came
to
interpreting
the
twin
of
rule
801(d)(2)(e)
the
twin
is
(d)(2)(d).
that
covers
agents'
statements
generally,
not
just
co-conspirators
as
argued
to
the
courts
of
appeals,
that
the
pre-rules
approach
should
be
taken,
that
even
though
rule
801(d)(2)(d)
draws
no
distinction
between
the
government
and
a
defendant,
between
the
government
and
a
corporation,
that
pre-rules
decisions
did
and
that
the
silence...
it
was
so
important
in
the
pre-rules
decisions,
the
silence
should
be
taken
as
determinative.
a
good
example
is
the
case,
united
states
versus
kempiles,
609
fed.
2d
1233,
seventh
circuit,
1979
in
which
this
court
denied
review.
no
rule
was
thought
clearer--
mr.
stephen
allan
saltzburg
--justice
scalia,
it
could
be
but
i
think
that
in
other
cases
the
united
states
has
indicated
it
too
understood
that
silence
might
be
meaningful
when
it
came
to
a
process
like
the
rules
of
evidence
which
are,
i
think
on
their
face,
not
meant
to
be
complete
unto
themselves.
but
a
second
case
where
it
is
the
best
example
of
the
plain
meaning
you
could
have
is
rule
410.
rule
410,
which
has
been
amended
a
couple
of
times
when
it
was
adopted,
covers
statements
by
a
defendant
in
plea
bargaining
and
offers
to
plead.
it
only
says,
"by
the
defendant",
and
it
says,
"these
statements
are
not
admissible
against
the
defendant."
the
government
argued
immediately
after
the
rule
took
effect,
although
it
said,
"statements
by
the
defendant
and
offers
by
the
defendant,
the
rule
must
apply
to
the
government."
because
it
did
before,
rejecting
the
plain
meaning
aria
persuading
indeed
the
eighth
circuit
in
the
united
states
versus
verduren
at
528
fed.
2d
103.
in
a
series
of
cases,
in
a
series
of
cases
involving
rule
8038(b)
which
says
that,
"observations
by
law
enforcement
officers
should
not
be
admissible
in
criminal
cases."
the
government
has
persuaded
a
series
of
appellate
courts
that
the
rule
should
not
be
read
as
it
seems
to
be
written.
that
is,
that
is
too
broad
an
exclusion.
the
united
states
would
suffer
too
much.
the
silence,
we
submit...
point
number
one
is
that
silence
can
be
meaningful.
point
number
two
is
that...
what
came
through
from
both
sides
of
this
argument
is
an
indication
as
to
how
important
the
independent
evidence
rule
was
prior
to
and
during
the
debates
on
these
rules.
that
is
why
the
fight
was
waged
the
way
it
was
before
this
court.
it
would
be,
in
our
judgment,
a
great
injustice
to
have
this
court
overturn
a
principle
of
such
long
standing
by
holding
that
no
one
paid
attention
to
it
and
therefore
it
is
gone.
i
submit
to
you
that
if
the
united
states
sought
to
amend
these
rules
by
doing
away
with
the
independent
evidence
requirement
following
a
decision
by
this
court
that
that
requirement
still
exists,
it
could
not
get
the
congress
to
be
interested.
it
could
not
get
the
committees
that
supervise
the
rules
to
be
interested,
and
it
could
not
persuade
this
court.
what
it
could
not
do
directly
in
the
sun,
it
should
not
be
permitted
to
do
in
the
shade,
which
is
what
it
asks
this
court
to
hold.
thank
you.
