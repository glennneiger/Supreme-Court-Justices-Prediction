but
what
did
the
statue
mean
by
"white
persons"?
who
were
white
persons?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
"white
persons"
meant
white
anglo-saxon
protestants?
what?
what
did
it
mean?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
stop
for
just
a
minute.
did
"white
person"
mean
anglo-saxon?
is
that
the
short
definition?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
isn't
that
what
at
the
bottom
of
it
all
your
test
amounts
to?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
can
discrimination
against
arabs
because
they
are
arabs
rather
than
caucasians
be
anything
but
a
national
origin
sort
of
a
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
it
looks
like
a
national
origin
test
and
sounds
like
a
national
origin
test,
is
that
what
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
then
what
do
we
do
with
jones,
which
says
that
doesn't
get
covered
under
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
that
is
why
you
want
to
avoid
calling
it
a
national
origin
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
even
though
it
looks
like
a
national
origin
test.
okay.
