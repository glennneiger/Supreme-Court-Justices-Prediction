mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
issues
similar
to
that
present
in
the
prior
discussion,
and
started
by
the
filing
of
three
complaints
in
the
western
district
of
pennsylvania
by
plaintiff
dr.
al-khazraji
charging
various
offenses
under
the
civil
rights
laws
of
the
united
states.
i
go
into
the
detail
only
because
there
is
some
question
as
to
what
the
pleadings
here
actually
raise,
and
therefore
you
have
the
question
as
to
the
kind
of
charges
that
were
in
fact
made.
my
brief
sets
forth
the
allegations
in
the
various
complaints
here,
and
i
would
note
that
the
operative
complaint
as
viewed
by
the
district
court
did
not
charge
any
racial
discrimination
but
charged
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
national
origin
and
religion,
and
that
therefore
the
question
then
becomes
whether
or
not
an
arab
under
the
facts
here
would
be
treated
as
falling
within
the
scope
of
section
1981
of
title
42
in
a
situation
when
in
fact
there
was
not
a
racial
allegation
made.
now,
i
should
say
in
all
fairness
that
district
judge
zigler
who
had
handled
the
case
before
it
was
reassigned
to
judge
menser
had
read
the
case
or
had
read
the
various
pleadings
more
broadly
than
judge
menser
did
and
more
broadly
apparently...
and
as
broadly
apparently
as
the
third
circuit
did
in
this
particular
situation.
but
the
fact
remains
that
the
operative
complaint
as
i
think
it
was
read
by
both
judge
zigler
and
judge
menser
was
really
the
second
complaint,
the
one
filed
by
prior
counsel
for
the
plaintiff
here,
and
that
complaint
basically
restricted
itself
to
a
national
origin
and
a
religion
complaint,
not
a
racial
one.
however,
the
issue
here
seems
to
be
premised
on
the
notion
that
in
fact
a
racial
complaint
at
least
could
arguably
be
read
into
the
complaint.
that
seems
to
be
the
basis
upon
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
in
this
case,
and
therefore
other
than
mentioning
the
limitations
on
the
actual
pleadings,
which
is
a
fact
that
the
court
might
take
into
consideration,
i
will
then
deal
with
the
argument
as
to
whether
or
not
arabs
do
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
1981
of
the--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
held
here
that
arabs
do
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
1981.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
oh,
yes,
indeed,
it
was.
i
mean,
the
least
the
way
the
third
circuit
interpreted
the
factual
situation.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
well,
your
honor,
the
point
about
getting
into
the
pleading
history
and
what
have
you
is
that
the
various
pleadings
are
some
indication
that
from
the
beginning
the
plaintiff
here
has
been
viewing
this
as
a
national
origin
claim
and
that
arab
at
least
initially
and
to
some
extent
has
been
characterized
as
being
in
the
national
origin
category.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
yes,
but
i
am
discussing
this
in
terms
of,
to
use
the
phrases
that
were
used
previously,
the--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--yes,
i
am...
yes,
i
will,
your
honor.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
my
position
is
really
a
rather
simple
one
in
this
case.
the
statute
basically
talks
in
terms
of
white
citizens
and
it
seems
fairly
well
admitted
by
the
plaintiff
himself
in
the
deposition
that
he
gave
that
he
qualifies
as
a
caucasian,
i.e.,
that
he
is
in
fact
racially
white.
the
charges
of
discrimination
are
presumably
that
he
was
discriminated
against
in
relation
to
other
people
who
are
racially
white,
and
our
position
very
simply
is
that
in
that
kind
of
a
factual
situation
a
claim
under
section
1981
is
not
made.
and
it
really
comes
down
to
that.
he
has
admitted
in
the
deposition
that
he
does
qualify
as
a
caucasian,
i.e.,
a
person
who
is
racially
white.
the
statute
has
been
construed
by
this
court
to
apply
on
a
racial
basis,
not
on
a
national
origin
basis,
not
on
a
religion
basis,
not
on
a
sex
basis,
and
therefore
once
the
plaintiff
in
essence
admits
that
he
is
a
caucasian,
and
when
his
purported
complaint
is
that
he
was
discriminated
against
in
denial
of
tenure
in
relation
to
other
caucasians,
that
a
claim
is
not
made
under
the
statute.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
absolutely.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
to
my
knowledge,
your
honor,
that
there
is
any
racial
animus
at
all
in
terms
of
the
decision
that
was
made.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
my
recollection
of
the
record
is
that
there
is
absolutely
no
evidence
in
the
record
at
all
to
indicate
that.
now,
i
will
say
in
all
fairness
that
there
was
very
limited
discovery
in
the
matter.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
that
is
correct
that
is
basically
what
we
end
up
having
here
because
the
presumed
discrimination
was
in
relation--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--your
honor,
all
i
can
do
is
read
the
way
the
court
of
appeals
dealt
with
the
racial
issue
and
defined
it
as
being
membership
in
a
group
that
is
ethnically
and
physiognomically
distinctive,
and
that
presumably
would
ignore
the
admission
of
the
plaintiff
that
he
in
fact
was
a
caucasian
and
was
presumably
discriminated
against
in
relation
to
other
caucasians.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
i
would
submit
it
is,
your
honor.
in
going
back
to
the
discussion
in
the
earlier--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--i
would
suggest
that
it
did,
your
honor,
yes,
that
the
language
used
in
the
statute
talks
about
white-citizens.
it
does
not
talk
about
various
ethnic
groups,
and
therefore
i
would
submit
that
ethnic
group
or
national
origin
claims
are
not
within
the
scope
of
section
1981,
and
that
essentially
is
what
the
plaintiff
is
arguing
in
this
case.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
your
honor,
i
have
read
the
references
to
the
congressional
globe
debates
that
are
cited--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--your
honor,
i
would
submit
that
that
is
irrelevant,
that
the
critical
thing
is
that
the
statute
is
in
terms
of
white
citizens,
and
the
contrast
therefore
to
have
a
discrimination
claim
under
1981
has
to
be
in
reference
to
white,
which
is
a
racial
characterization,
and
that
you
cannot
contrast
that
and
treat
germans
or
english
or
greeks
or
italians
as
being
people
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
if
the
court
please,
i
do
not
think
that
the
legislative
history
is
anywhere
near
clear
enough
to
indicate
that
that
in
fact
is
what
the
39th
congress
had
in
mind
whenever
they
were
going
through
the
debates
on
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866.
i
mean,
i
do
not
dispute
that
there
were
a
number
of
references
in
the
legislative
history
where
what
we
now
call
ethnic
groups
were
characterized
as
races,
but
there
is
no
real
indication
as
i
read
that
history
that
in
fact
there
was
a
clear
intent
that
those
people
be
included.
actually,
if
you
look
at--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--justice
scalia,
even
if
that
is
so--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--justice...
i
am
sorry.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
well,
i--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--color
in
the
racial
sense
at
least.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
because
otherwise
we
start
getting
into
the
situation
that
we
then
start
looking
for
1981
purposes
at
the
individual
shades
of
the
purported
plaintiffs
and
then
starting
deciding
what
degree
of
darkness
or
lightness,
depending
on
a
particular
situation,
we
are
going
to
say
is
sufficiently
distinctive
so
that
we
are
going
to
get
involved
in
saying
that
we
are
making
out
a
section
1981
claim
because
the
purported
favored
group
is
dark
and
the
purported
aggrieved
group
is
light
or
vice
versa.
and
i
would
suggest
that
the
characterization
in
the
statute,
because
of
the
use
of
the
term
white
does
not
include
ethnic
groups
even
though
there
were
some
discussions
during
the
legislative
history
and
even
though
the
dictionary
definitions
indicate
that
the
term
race
may
have
had
some
meaning
beyond
or
was
used
in
other
than
the
racial
sense
in
which
we
use
it
today.
the
fact
is
that
the
statute
was
not
written
that
way,
and
i
would
submit
that
if
congress
had
in
mind
the
notion
that
all
these
various
ethnic
groups
were
to
be
covered,
there
would
be
some...
much
broader
language
could
have
been
used
than
was
used
in
the
actual
statute.
i
mean,
actually,
the
interesting
thing
is,
if
you
look
at
the
legislative
history,
when
they
start
talking
about
the
different
kind
of
ethnic
groups
and
they
are
described
as
race,
it
so
often
comes
up
in
the
question
of
they
are
really
talking
about
the
legislatures
having
power
to
discriminate
by
saying
the
germans,
for
example,
are
not
allowed
to
own
property
and
things
of
that
sort.
in
some
ways
we
go
back
to
the
earlier
discussions
that
the
court
had
as
to
whether
the
statute
in
fact
covers
private
claims
of
action,
and
the
decisions
of
the
court
have
determined,
of
course,
that
it
does,
so
we
have
to
operate
on
that
premise.
and
you
also
run
into
the
generalized
disagreement
that
the
court
has
had
over
the
years
whether
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
and
the
reenactment
in
1870
were
in
fact
designed
to
deal
solely
with
the
freed
slaves
and
the
people
in
the
south
rather
than
the
broadened
scope
that
has
since
been
given
so
that
it
now
apparently
covers
discrimination
against
whites,
at
least
vis-a-vis
people
of
other
races.
but
those
decisions
have
been
reached.
unless
the
court
is
prepared
to
find
exceptions
to
those
or
overrule
those
earlier
lines
of
cases,
we
have
to
face
the
fact
that
this
court
has
already
decided
that
the
scope
of
the
statute
goes
beyond
the
mere
protection
of
blacks
which
was
one
of
the
earlier
positions
that
was
taken.
but
in
light
of
the
history,
i
would
suggest
that
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
the
court
to
go
beyond
the
broad
categorizations
and
extend
the
reach
of
the
statue
to
in
essence
start
covering
ethnic
groups
or
nationality
groups
or
nation
origin
groups,
which
is
the
suggestion
that
is
being
made
here.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
that,
too,
would
be
correct
under
mcdonald.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
well,
the
only
thing
we
have
in
the
record
at
this
point
is
that
the
only
other
person
granted
tenure--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--was
the
plaintiff's
wife,
and
she
was
granted
tenure
two
years
after
he
was
turned
down
for
tenure.
i
mean,
the
record
other
than
that
has
no
evidence
in
it
as
to
what
occurred
as
far
as
the
granting
of
tenure
is
concerned.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
the
way
the
third
circuit
apparently
has--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
his
claim
essentially
is
that
he
was
discriminated
against
on
the
basis
that
he
is
an
arab
who
was
born
in
iraq.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
justice
stevens,
that
is
correct
as
far
as
the
third
circuit
is
concerned.
that
is
not
necessarily
part
of
the
complaint
of
the
plaintiff.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
i
think
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
yes,
if
you
treat
that
as
a...
i
always
get
confused...
as
an
"and"
rather
then
as
an
"or"
in
terms
of
the
requirement
that
both
be
present,
that
would--
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
--if
the
reading
that
justice
scalia
is
giving
it
is
the
appropriate,
one,
then
i
think
what
you
say
does
follow.
i
don't
see
how
the
answer
could
be
anything
other
than
an
affirmative.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
i
suppose
that
might
be
true,
your
honor.
i
am
not
totally
sure.
but
if
you
read
it
as
requiring
that
both...
that
both
be
present,
that
it
be
genetically
part
of
an
ethnically
and
physiognomically
distinctive
subgrouping,
then
presumably
you
would
need
both
to
be
able
to
make
a
claim
out.
now,
how
you
end
up
making
it
out
and
the
kind
of
proofs
that
would
be
required
and
what
you
would
end
up
charging
a
jury
or
the
standard
that
the
district
judge
would
use
in
terms
of
factfinding,
i
would
not
be
presume
to
be
able
to
tell
you.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
it
might.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
i
suppose
it
might
decide
or
a
factfinder
could
decide
that
german
is
an
ethnic
group,
and
that
there
are
some
physical
characteristics
that
are
uniquely
enough
belonging
to
germans
that
one
could
end
up
saying
they
have
been
discriminated
against
under
this
particular
test.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
same
thing
with
irish,
i
mean,
presumably
every
ethnic
group
in
one
way
or
another,
at
least
one
way
or
another
someone
could
end
up
saying
they
have
physiognomically
distinctive
characteristics
that
fit
within
the
stereotype
of
a
particular
ethnic
group.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
i
mean
essentially
without
rehashing
what
was
said
during
the
first
argument,
that
essentially
is
our
position,
that
there
are
really
no
precedents
of
the
court
that
would
include
the
plaintiff
here
within
section
1981
that
the
statute
itself
should
be
read
the
way
i
have
suggested
that
it
should,
that
a
claim
here
which
is
essentially
a
national
origin
claim
does
not
fall
within
the
scope
of
the
statute.
if
the
court
has
no
other
questions,
i
would
be
prepared
to
go
on
and
discuss
the
retroactivity
issue.
again,
the
position
on
the
retroactivity
issue
is
really
a
rather
simple
one.
this
court
decided
in
wilson
versus
garcia
that
in
section
1983
cases
the
personal
injury
statute
of
the
various
states
would
be
used
to
decide
the
scope
of
the
statute
of
limitations
for
section
1983
cases.
the
third
circuit
concluded
in
the
goodman
case
that
the
two-year
statute
would
be
applied,
and
that
it
is
being
applied
in
section
1981
cases,
which
is
what
is
present
here.
the
question
before
us
is
how
we
would
apply
the
retroactivity
standards
of
chevron
oil
versus
hughson.
as
i
read
the
recent
decision
of
this
court
in
the
criminal
retroactivity
case
that
came
down
not
too
long
ago
there
is
specific
language
indicating
that
that
case
is
limited
to
criminal
cases
and
not
to
civil
cases
and
that
chevron
is
still
the
standard
to
be
applied
in
civil
retroactivity
cases,
which
is
what
we
have
here.
again,
i
really
have
two
simple
arguments
in
regard
to
the
retroactivity.
one,
that
the
proper
scope
is
not
necessarily
the
degree
of
certainty
within
a
particular
circuit,
but
that
considering
the
wide
ranging
divergence
of
views
as
to
statutes
that
were
to
be
followed
in
the
various
circuits
through
the
united
states
in
the
application
of
statute
of
limitations
under
the
federal
civil
rights
acts,
that
no
person
could
reasonably
have
relied
on
any
particular
statute
of
limitations
and
that
therefore
the
onus
was
on
plaintiffs
to
in
essence
go
for
the
shortest
potential
statute
in
a
particular
jurisdiction.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
your
honor,
obviously
if
the
court
concludes
that
it
is
permissible,
then
it
can
be.
my
suggestion
is
that
it
really
should
be
done
on
a
national
basis.
if
you
do
it
on
a
circuit
by
circuit
basis,
then
i
would
suggest
that
as
of
the
time
of
the
accrual
of
the
cause
of
action
here
for
the
reasons
basically
set
forth
in
the
brief
when
i
discussed
the
davis
case
and
the
way
the
pennypacker
case
had
been
decided
previously,
that
it
was
nowhere
clear
that
a
six-year
statute
of
limitations
rather
than
a
shorter
statute
of
limitations
was
going
to
be...
was
going
to
be
applied,
that
those
cases
if
you
read
them
carefully
simply
were
not
clearcut
enough
so
that
one
could
say
that
in
all
1981
cases
regardless
of
which
of
the
particular
subdivisions
of
1981
was
going
to
be
applied
and
regardless
of
the
type
of
case
involved,
that
there
was
going
to
be
a
six-year
statute
applied
rather
than
a
two-year
statute.
therefore
without
getting
into
the
convenience
factor
and
the
notion
that
full
retroactivity
here
gives
a
much
greater
degree
of
certainty
than
attempting
to
go
through
the
procedure
that
has
been
happening
since
wilson
versus
garcia
came
down
with
this
myriad
of
cases
in
the
circuits
trying
to
decide
how
much
certainty
was
there
and
how
much
certainty
was
there
not,
that
the
certainty
aspect
would
in
fact
be
enhanced
by
a
determination
that
full
retroactivity
is
appropriate.
but
in
any
case,
if
you
go
through
the
pennsylvania
cases,
that
is
the
third
circuit
cases
interpreting
the
status
of
its
decisions
on
how
the
statute
of
limitations
was
to
be
applied
in
section
1983
cases,
i
suggest
to
you
that
there
was
no
certainty
upon
which
anyone
could
have
relied,
and
that
in
any
case
the
1978
amendments
to
the
pennsylvania
statute
of
limitations
statutory
scheme
completely
reopened
the
door
anyway,
and
that
the
third
circuit
in
its
own
cases
basically
indicated
that
the
1978
amendments
cast
substantial
doubt
on
the
statute
of
limitations
aspect
of
davis.
davis
is
specifically
mentioned
by
the
third
circuit,
end
yet
in
our
case
the
the
third
circuit
relies
on
davis
as
indicating
certainty
was
present
as
far
as
the
retroactivity
is
concerned.
i
will
reserve
any
further
time
i
have,
unless
the
court
has
any
questions.
mr.
nick
s.
fisfis
if
the
court
please,
i
am
just
going
to
take
about
30
seconds
only
to
reply
to
the
last
matter
on
the
remand,
and
may
i
suggest
that
if
the
court
looks
at
the
chronology
of
events
the
discharge
of
the
plaintiff
was
in
may
of
1979,
well
before
the
statute
of
limitations...
the
two-year
pennsylvania
statute
of
limitations
would
have
run
if
that
one
is
the...
if
the
court
treats
it
as
retroactive,
and
therefore
anything
that
anybody
may
have
said
to
the
plaintiff
about
not
doing
anything
and
going
through
internal
processes
would
not
really
have
made
any
difference,
because
he
still
had
plenty
of
time
to
file
within
the
two-year
period,
so
there
is
no
basis
for
equitable
estoppel
in
this
situation,
even
if
you
believe
the
allegations
in
his
affidavit
that
certain
statements
were
made.
thank
you.
