ms.
caroline
mitchell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
this
court,
we
are
asking
this
court
today
to
decide
whether
section
1981
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1866
covers
those
of
arab
ancestry.
we
premise
our
argument
on
two
very
important
points.
first,
the
meaning
of
the
word
1987
is
not
the
same
as
those
legislators
used
it
in
1866.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
we
look
at
the
term
1866
act
was
passed
was
that
in
the
1830s
there
was
an
influx
of
irish
and
german.
these
waves
of
immigrants
created
some
severe
problems
for
persons
in
states
such
as
ohio
who
believed
as
advocates
of
the
american
nativist
movement
that
the
irish
and
the
germans
were
not
fit
to
live
with
those
of
the
anglo-saxon
race.
a
prominent
know-nothing
tract
published
in
1854
indicated
that
irish
and
germans
were
not
of
the
type
of
quality
of
persons
that
we
would
want
dwelling
with
those
of
the
anglo-saxon
race,
and
openly
advocated
discrimination
against
those
people.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
legislation--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
senator
trumble,
who
was
the
author
of
the
1866
legislation,
spoke
to
the
purposes
of
the
1866
legislation
and
in
that
legislative
history
indicated
that
one
of
his
objectives
was
to
make
sure
that
persons
of
all
races
and
colors
and
previous
conditions
of
servitude
had
equal
rights
under
the
law.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
no,
that
is
not
all,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
the
concept
of
race
was
a
generally
understood
term
for
the
legislatures
in
those
days
to
use
in
the
sense
that
we
now
use
the
word
"ancestry".
to
the
legislators
in
1866
"race"
meant
"ancestry".
senator
merrill
in
the
case
indicates--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
it
is
relevant
because
this
court
has
indicated
in
several
decisions
that
as
a
racial
character
of
rights
that
1981
was
intended
to
protect.
we
look
back
at
the
1866
act
to
see
what
the
meaning
of
1866,
and
it
was
a
far
different
definition.
those
legislators
believed
that
by
covering
various
races
they
were
covering
the
swiss,
the
german,
those
of
the
scandinavian
race,
those
moors
and
turks,
and
some
immigrants
who
were
yet
to
come
to
the
shores.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
no,
your
honor.
there
are--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is
correct.
i
believe
that
your
later
decisions
looked
at
the
1866
act
to
see
what
was
meant
by
the
term
"race"
which
to
this
day
has
not--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
we
look
at
the
decisions
of
this
court.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
this
court
has
never
addressed
the
issue.
this
court
has
never
defined
"race"
for
us.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
well,
your
honor,
if
this
court
has
held
that
1981
is
intended
to
protect
against
racially
motivated
deprivals
of
the
right
to
contract--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--are
intended
to
enjoy
equal
rights
under
the
law.
yes,
that
is
correct.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
if
we
go
from
that
sentence--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
the
word
1966.
anglo-saxon
was
the
term
of
preference.
the
legislators
were
unanimously
anglo-saxon.
they
intended
in
their
definitions
in
1866
to
characterize
the
anglo-saxon
race
as
the
one
to
which
all
other
races
aspired.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
the
term
1865
legislators,
and
it
as
this
exact
problem,
the
problem
created
by
the
know-nothing
party
that
certain
legislators
intended
to
correct
under
the
1866
act.
they
said
that
if
ohio
shall
pass
an
act
which
denies
to
a
german
citizen
the
right
to
contract--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--in
1866,
i
believe
that
it
was,
for
the
additional
reason
that
in
1866
immigration
into
this
country
was
very
severely
limited
to
only
races
such
as
the
germans
and
the
irish
in
the
east
and
the
chinese
in
the
west.
one
of
the
problems
facing
the
legislators
of
1866
was
that
there
would
be
discrimination
against
chinese,
there
was
discrimination
against
irish,
there
was
discrimination
against
germans,
and
the
1866
act
was
intended
to
give
to
all
men
equal
protection--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--i
am
partially
defending
it
in
the
sense
that
they
indicate--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--i
am
not
defending
their
definition,
your
honor,
for
this
reason.
i
believe
that
ancestry
in
the
minds
of
the
1866
legislators
meant
race.
i
believe
that
the
1866
act
is
intended
to
protect
those
of
different
ancestries.
the
third
circuit
held
that
an
arab,
an
ethic
arab
of
arabian
and
iraqi
ancestry
could
pursue
a
claim
under
section
1981.
we
agree
with
their
findings,
but
we
believe
that
the
test
that
the
third
circuit
used
has
some
very
severe
problems
for
this
court--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--their
test
is
that
one
who
is
ethnically
and
physiognomically
different
may
maintain
a
claim
under
1981.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
we
suggest
that
the
proper
test
is
that
one
who
is
of
an
ancestry
viewed
as
different
may
maintain
a
claim
under
1981.
we
believe
that
if
you
were
to
use
the
ethnical
and
physiognomical
test
you
would
get
the
federal
district
courts
into
looking
at
the
physiognomical
characteristics
of
people--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--pardon
me?
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
no,
your
honor,
because
they
are
not
of
a
distinct
ancestral
group.
our
definition--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
then
you
are
into
the
subjective
type
of
discrimination
issue.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
no,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
well,
i
am
not,
and
you
are
probably
not.
the
ancestral
test,
your
honor,
is
an
objective
test.
it
looks
at
whether
the
ancestry
of
a
certain
people
is
one
which
has
been
viewed
as
distinct.
for
instance--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--the
jews
have
a
certain
ancestry.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
absolutely,
your
honor.
the
point
is
that
if
you
are
discriminated
against
because
your
ancestry
is
norwegian,
you
have
a
cause
of
action
under
section
1981,
regardless
of
whether
the
perpetrator
is--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
that
makes
no
difference
to
us,
and
the
reason
is
that
country
of
origin
is
not
a
good
test
for
that
exact
reason.
if
this--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
if
there
is
discrimination
because
of
the
ancestry
of
the
person,
if
a
college
refuses
to
tenure
germans
believing
for
whatever
reason
that
they
don't
deserve
to
be
tenured
because
of
an
ancestral--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
that
is
not
ancestral
discrimination,
in
our
opinion.
ancestral
discrimination
as
defined
by
the
ethnologists
in
the
20th
century
relates
to
the
culture
from
which
your
forebears
came.
there
is
in
fact
a
jewish
culture,
a
scandinavian
culture,
an
irish
culture,
a
german
culture.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
ancestry
takes
into
account
your
state
as
being
one
of
the
covered
categories.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
because
the
common
perception
is
that
rhode
island
people
are
not
of
different
ancestry
than
pennsylvanians.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
that
that
is
the
type
of
ancestral
discrimination
that
we
want
to
cover
under
our
test
nor
was
it
the
type
of
ancestral
discrimination
that
the
1866
act--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
the
ancestral
theory
relates
back
to
what
was
in
the
minds
of
the
legislators
in
1866.
the
legislators
in
1866
clearly
considered
race
as
meaning
ancestry.
the
fact
that
we
use
the
term
"race"
today
to
mean
the
five
divisions
of
mankind
as
proposed
by
modern
ethnologists
does
not
make
any
difference.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
i
am
trying
to
avoid
a
country
of
origin
definition
because
i
think
country
of
origin
is
a
very
difficult
thing.
i
think
that
you
can
be
traditionally
viewed
as
irish
whether
your
ancestors
are
the
irish
free
state
or
whether
they
were
born
in
betfast.
i
think
that
this
court
does
not
need
to
address
that
precise
issue.
the
ancestral
definition
that
we
propose
looks
to
whether
your
forebears
are
of
a
different
subgroup
or--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--but
they
are
not
of
the
type
of
people
that
the
1866
act
was
intended
to
protect.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
the
second--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is
certainly
one
workable
definition,
your
honor,
but
then
we
get
to
the--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--we
can
look
to
the
1866
congress
usage
of
the
term
"race"
to
see
what
they
meant.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
the
test
that
we
are
proposing.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
i
think
that
there
is
enough
language
in
the
1866
act
to
suggest
that
those
legislatures
did
view
as
separate
races
those
coming
from
those
discrete
geographic
areas
which
are
perhaps
now
known
as
countries
and
perhaps
not.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
no,
that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
your
honor,
my
client
and
his
physiognomy
would
be
viewed
by
the
third
circuit
as
the
type
of
physiognomy
entitling
him
to
maintain--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--well,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
this
court
can
refine
this
notion
of
physiognomy.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
i
reject
it
in
part.
insofar
as
the
court
of
appeals
test
suggests
that
ancestry
or
ethnic
origin
is
part
of
the
foundation
for
proving
your
1981
claim,
that
is
certainly
a
workable
and
usable
definition
that
these
courts
can
utilize.
i
am
not
in
favor
of
a
test
which
would
require
a
federal
district
court
to
look
at
the
physiognomy
of
a
person
who
comes
in
and
indicate
that
if
you
have
slanted
eyes
then
you
are
entitled
to
pursue
your
claim
because
you
are
probably
oriental,
but
if
your
eyes
are
not
slanted
enough
then
how
can
we
conclude
that
you
are
entitled
to
sue?
what
would
happen
to
mr.
justice
marhsall's
father
if
we
use
a
physiognomy
test
as
part
of
the
ethnic
origin
or
ancestry
test.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
precisely
the
issue.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
under
the
modern
day
classifications
of
race
residents
of
south
africa
are
not
classified
at
all.
the
modern
day
definition
of
race
adopted
by
the
eeoc--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
0
[generallaughter.]
there
are
vast
groups
of
people
who
do
not
fall
within--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
the
people
from
nigeria
are
caucasian,
because
there
is
a
portion
of
caucasia--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is
precisely...
that
is
the
point,
your
honor.
the
point
is
that
if
we
use
a
dictionary
definition
of
caucasian
we
have
middle
east
caucasians
who
are
arab--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
the
original
definition
in
1854
was
that
it
was
a
resident
of
the
caucuses
mountains
between
the
black
sea
and
the
caspian
sea.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
not
from
any
right
now.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
beg
pardon,
your
honor?
ms.
caroline
mitchell
i
am
what
the
eeoc
has
called
the
white
european
subdivision
of
the
caucasian
race.
we
also
have
north
african
persons
who
are
usually
black,
residents
of
libya
who
may
in
fact
be
jews.
we
also
have
the
hispanic
caucasians
who
are
mexican.
if
you
believe
the
petitioner's
argument
here
hispanic
caucasians
cannot
sue
because
they
are
caucasian.
arabs
who
are
middle
east
caucasian
cannot
sue
because
they
are
also
caucasian.
they
may
have
a
different
skin
color.
they
may
be
ethnically
and
physiognomically
different
under
the
third
circuit's
test.
they
are
certainly
ancestrally
different
under
our
test
which
we
propose
to
this
court
today.
but
the
fact
that
they
are
caucasian
under
some
modern
ethnological
theory
thus
means
that
they
are
not
entitled
to
sue
under
section
1981.
we
cannot
believe
that
this
court
should
use
that
as
a
definition.
we
cannot
believe
that
the
federal
district
courts
here
should
look
at
one
of
50
dictionaries
to
see
whether
a
syrian
is
a
caucasian
or
is--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--if
you
choose
to
affirm
the
third
circuit,
your
honor,
my
client
would
be
very
happy,
but
that
is
not
our
theory
of
this
case.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
absolutely,
your
honor.
that
is
exactly
true.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
my
particular
concern
with
the
third
circuit--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--yes,
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
well,
your
honor,
what
i
am
attempting
to
do
is
to--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--you
do
not
have
to
reach
that.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
well,
the
issue,
your
honor,
i
think--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
i
believe--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--i
believe
that
the
theory
that
we
have
suggested
to
this
court,
the
ancestry
theory
is
one
which
is
much
more
workable
in
the
federal
district
courts
as
a
threshold
question
for
persons
advancing
a
1981
claim.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
part
of
it
is,
your
honor.
that
is
correct.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
the
national
origin
question
is
a
very
difficult
one
that
we
need
not
address,
first
of
all.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
i
believe
not.
and
i
believe
that
if
a
person,
for
instance,
who
is
armenian
of
ancestry
is
denied
a
right
to
contract
because
they
believe
he
might
be
a
terrorist,
that
if
we
use
a
national
origin
test
he
loses
because
armenia
is
not
a
country.
if
we
use
an
ancestral
test--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--your
honor,
we
believe
that
it
is
a
test
that
most
properly
focuses
on
the
fact
that
those
of
arab
ancestry
are,
for
instance,
traditionally
disadvantaged,
viewed
as
different,
of
a
different
culture--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--it
may
be
a
national
origin
test.
the
problem--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
that
it
would
be--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is
correct.
that
is
precisely
our
point.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
in
art
it
looks
like
national
origin.
but
our
position
is
that
if
the
court
looks
to
the
ancestry
of
the
person
as
the
1866
act
suggested,
that
in
fact
not
only
is
our
client
an
arab
able
to
maintain
suit
under
1981,
the
jewish
members
of
shaare
tefila
synagogue
will
win
their
case
because
ancestrally
they
were
perceived
to
be
a
different
group.
whether
or
not
they
believed
themselves
to
be
a
different
group
is
not
a
issue.
the
issue
is
that
ancestrally
jews
were
discriminated
against
because
of
their
culture
and
because
of
their
ethnicity,
not
because
they
were
or
were
not
advocates
of
a
certain
religious
tenet.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
correct,
your
honor.

mitchell

not
a

definition
and

definition,

mitchell
your
honor,
i
suggest
that
looking
to
any
dictionary
is
going
to
give
you
50
different
answers
to
the
same
question.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
in
1866
the
answer
is
very
clear.
in
1987
the
answer
may
not
be
so
clear.
but
if
one
uses
the
ancestral
theory
of
discrimination
swedes
are
of
a
separate
ancestry.
if
they
are
discriminated
against
because
of
that
ancestry
then
they
have
a
right
under
1981
to
redress.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
that
is
correct,
i
was.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
my
answer
to
that
question
is
that
if
a
group
such
as
jews
is
discriminated
against
because
of
their
ancestral
characteristics
and
beliefs,
they
have
a
right
under
1982.
it
is
not
founded
on
their
religious
beliefs.
it
is
not
a
measure
of
whether
subjectively
the
neonazis
believe
that
the
jews
because
of
their
religion
deserve
to
be
discriminated
against.
our
test--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--then
i
will
sue
you
under
section
1982
and
under
section
1981.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
i
believe
that--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--you
have
discriminated,
and
it
is
covered
under
section
1981.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
your
honor,
whether
the
belief
is
mistaken
is
not
at
issue.
whether
they
were
right
or
wrong
in
believing
a
certain
ancestry
to
be--
ms.
caroline
mitchell
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
we
cannot
use
the
subjective
intent
of
the
parties
as
our
touchstones
of
whether
there
has
been
discrimination
if
we
have
a
smart
neonazi
party
they
say,
oh,
we
don't
view
jews
as
a
separate
race
and
we
are
discriminating
against
them
because
of
their
religion
and
therefore
we
are
not
going
to
suffer
an
award
in
the
federal
district
court
of
attorney
fees
and
punitive
damages.
we
are
going
to
have
our
state
remedy.
ms.
caroline
mitchell
well,
it
would
be
covered
by
1981
or
1982
if
the
belief
was
an
ancestral
belief
that
arabs
are
terrorists
or
that
jews
are
inferior.
it
is
not
directed
at
them
because
of
their
moslem
faith
or
their
jewish
faith.
it
is
directed
at
them
because
of
what
society
perceives
to
be
a
difference
between
their
culture
and
the
cultures
of
other
people.
i
would
like
to
address
one
question
that
justice
stevens
raised
in
the
shaare
tefila
argument.
you
asked,
did
the
people
who
passed
1982
think
jews
were
a
separate
race.
our
answer
to
the
questions
is
yes,
they
did
believe
that
jews
and
swedes
and
irish
and
germans
were
a
separate
race,
and
we
advocate
here
today
that
the
1866
act
was
intended
to
cover
that
perception,
that
ancestral
use
of
the
term.
with
the
court's
permission,
i
would
like
to
move
to
the
chevron
aspect
of
my
argument.
my
argument
there
is,
first
of
all,
that
the
third
circuit
was
correct
in
holding
that
under
chevron
considerations,
the
claim
under
1981
was
timely
filed.
i
will
call
to
the
court's
attention
one
fact.
the
author
of
the
decision
in
the
third
circuit,
judge
stapleton,
was
also
the
author
of
a
1977
case,
davis,
which
was
the
case
relied
upon
by
litigants
to
believe
that
there
was
a
six-year
statute
in
the
third
circuit.
we
believe
that
judge
stapleton
correctly
interprets
the
law
of
the
circuit
in
that
regard.
should,
however,
this
court
find
that
it
would
be
appropriate
to
apply
a
two-year
statute
of
limitations
to
1981
under
wilson,
we
ask
that
this
court,
remand
our
case
to
the
district
for
consideration
of
the
equitable
estoppel
arguments.
these
arguments
were
raised
both
before
the
district
court
and
before
the
circuit,
but
need
not
have
been
reached
by
either
of
those
courts
in
reaching
their
determination.
thank
you.
