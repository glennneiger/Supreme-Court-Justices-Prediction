yes,
but
may
i
ask,
he
doesn't
just
limit
it
to
ethnic
differences,
but
at
least
the
court
of
appeals
ethnically
and
physiognomically
distinctive.
in
other
words,
one
of
the
two
elements
of
their
test,
as
i
understand
it,
is
some
kind
of
inherited
characteristic
that
is
visible
physically,
that
you
can
see.
people
are
maybe
eight
feet
tall
or
something,
and
also
from
a
particular
country.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
in
order
to
prevail
under
the
third
circuit's
theory,
which
we
are
reviewing,
he
would
have
to
prove,
as
i
understand
it,
that
he
was
in
a
separate
ethnic
group
and
a
separate
group
that
was
physiognomically
distinctive
from
the
general
population.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
mean
there
are
two
ingredients
that
are
part
of
their
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
would
therefore
fit
into
the
point
that
justice
scalia
was
suggesting
earlier,
that
a
given
stock
is
subject
to...
if
you
are
of
a
particular
national
origin
which
also
has
particular
physical
characteristics
that
make
you
identifiable,
and
then
that
group
as
a
whole
is
subjected
to
discrimination,
you
fit
this
test.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
see,
it
wouldn't
necessarily
cover
every
national
origin
claim.
you
might
have
two
countries
in
south
american
where
the
people
are
not
physiognomically
distinctive,
but
yet
they
might
be
different
from
the
population
at
large
in
the
united
states.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
have
to
know
who
the
real
mccoy
is.
0
[generallaughter.]
that
is
right.
that
is
what
i
was
leading
up
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
is
the
test
you
are
proposing?
and
then
you
have
to
prove
that
they
thought
about
the
persians
as
a
separate
rate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
get
one
thing
clear
in
my
mind.
you
are
not
defending
the
court
of
appeals'
second
element,
physiognomically
distinctive.
you
want
us
to
change
that
definition,
and
you
did
not
file
a
cross-petition
for
cert.--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
you
want
us
to
in
effect
broaden
the
definition
that
they
applied
because
i
suspect
maybe
you
have
concern
about
whether
your
client
can
satisfy
that
element
of
the
test.
