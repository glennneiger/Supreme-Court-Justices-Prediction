saint
francis
college
versus
mahid
ghaidan
al-khazraji,
etcetera.
mr.
fisfis,
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
think
it
is
permissible,
mr.
fisfis,
to
go
circuit
by
circuit
on
this
retroactivity
business?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fisfis.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
mitchell.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist

do
you
get
around
that?

chief

william
h.
rehnquist
how--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
easy
does
that
ancestry
word
make
it
much
easier?
you
have
referred
to
the
scandinavians
as
of
one
ancestry.
now,
could
a
person
of
norwegian
extraction
bring
an
action
against
someone
of
swedish
extraction
for
discrimination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
norway
and
sweden
were
one
country
up
until
1905?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
about
someone
of
bavarian
extraction
suing
someone
of
some
other
german
area?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
i
don't
like
people
who
were
born
in
rhode
island,
or
the
rhode
island
culture?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
can
take
into
account
someone
born
in
bavaria,
why
can't
it
take
into
account
someone
born
in
rhode
island?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
just
answers
the
question
by
defining
it.
how
about
somebody
born
in
new
england
as
compared
with
somebody
born
in
the
deep
south?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ancestry
means
forebears,
and
all
of
these
questions
that
have
been
put
to
you
say
what
about
this
kind
of
forebears.
and
you
speak
as
though
you
have
in
mind
something
much
narrower
than
just
forebears
when
you
use
the
term
"ancestry".
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
mitchell.
mr.
fisfis,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
fisfis.
the
case
is
submitted.
we
will
resume
at
1:00
o'clock.
