you
say
ethnicity
is
different
from
race.
it
is
nowadays,
but
it
was
not
in
1866,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
never
mind
that.
the
dictionary
definitions
that
are
set
forth
extensively
in
the
briefs.
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
they
thought
they
were
doing
something
about
race
in
the
sense
that
they
understood
race
at
that
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
it
is
clear
that
what
they
meant
by
race
is
something
quite
different
from
what
we
mean
by
race.
i
think
that
is
absolutely
clear.
not
just
from
the
legislative
debates,
but
from
the
dictionary
definitions
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
meant
a
stock,
a
stock
of
people,
whether
it
was
ethnically
distinct
or
not,
but
i--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
think
the
other
point
you
are
making
i
think
is
worth
pursuing,
and
that
is,
does
white
person
imply
only
color,
or
does
it
mean
race?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
it
means
just
color.
justice
antonin
scalia
color
in
the
racial
sense
at
least.
justice
antonin
scalia
[inaudible]
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
you
tell
me
how
you
get
the
word
"race"
to
be
relevant
to
the
meaning
of
"white
person".
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
now,
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
i
believe
all
of
that,
but
the
way
to
combat
that
would
have
been
to
use
the
word
"race"
in
the
statute.
now,
they
did
not
use
the
word
"race"
in
the
statute,
did
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
dictionary
definitions
you
should
have
given
us
were
the
dictionary
definitions
of
"white"
instead
of
the
dictionary
definitions
of
"race".
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
is
the
only
thing
you
are
going
to
rely
on
to
get
us
to
believe
that
the
word--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that
the
word
"white
person"
in
the
statute
means
"race"?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
mitchell,
i
don't
think
you
are
understanding
me.
i
believe
all
that.
i
am
with
you
on
that
point.
but
the
word
"race"
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
of
what
relevance
is
it
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
only
evidence
that
"white
person"
in
the
statute
means
"race"
was
the
one
snippet
of
legislative
history
you
just
quoted.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
say
later
decisions
of
ours,
which
say
it
is--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
term
1866
act.
justice
antonin
scalia
viewed
by
whom?
by
the
defendant?
i
mean,
suppose
i
don't
like
the
mccoys.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
a
hatfield,
and
i
don't
like
the
mccoys.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
i
view
all
mccoys
as
bad.
i
don't
care
where
they
are.
if
they
have
the
name
mccoy,
they
are
bad.
now,
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--who
decides
who
is
a
distinct
ancestral...
i
think
they
are
a
distinct
ancestral
group.
i
think
all
mccoys
are
mccoys.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at.
is
it
subjective:
if
it
is
not
subjective--
justice
antonin
scalia
you
didn't
like
mccoys
either,
and
you
know,
that
is
why
i
picked
mccoys,
because
they
are
all
of
the
common
ancestor.
they
all
have
the
same
name.
they
are
all
from
the
same--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
that
is
your
second
qualification.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
has
to
be
an
ancestral
group
that
the
congress
in
1866
would
have
identified
as
a
race.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
what
does
that
mean?
is
that
what
you
are
proposing,
that
it
has
to
be,
number
one,
an
ancestral
group,
and
number
two,
a
group
that
the
1866
congress
would
have
said
is
a
race?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
we
can.
are
you
going
to
answer
my
question?
is
that
the
test
you
are
proposing,
number
one,
ancestor,
and
number
two,
it
is
a
group
that
the
1866
congress
would
have
considered
to
be
a
race?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
you
think
the
third
circuit's
test
is
so
implausible
that
we
are
so
unlikely
to
adopt
it
that
you
are
trying
to
suggest
one
that
would
win
for
your
client
that
is
plausible.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
that
is
what
you
are
trying
to
do.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
say
were
perceived
to
be,
you
don't
mean
by
the
people
who
committed
the
acts.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
by
society.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
have
us
look
to
modern
dictionaries
to
figure
out
what
is
a
race.
you
would
have
us
look
to
old
dictionaries.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
we
find
out
whether
society
at
large
considered...
i
mean
i
think
jews
is
probably
an
easy
question,
but
i
don't
know.
swedes.
how
do
i
figure
out
whether
society
at
large
considered
them
a
separate
race
in
your
sense?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
your
question
regarding
justice
marshall's
father
leads
me
to
believe
you
were
here
during
the
earlier
argument.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
would
your
answer
have
been
to
the
questions
i
was
asking
about
whether
the
intent
to
discriminate
has
to
be
specifically
directed
to
a
dislike
of
the
race
as
opposed
to
a
dislike
of
some
characteristic
which
one
thinks
people
that
race
or
of
that
whatever
you
want
to
call
the
group
happen
to
share?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
question
i
asked
whether
if
i
think
italians
or
french
or
you
pick
the
racial
group,
i
think
they
are
sloppy
and
therefore
i
don't
want
to...
i
will
not
rent
an
apartment.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
not
that
i
hate
the
french.
i
have
nothing
against
the
race.
i
just
don't
think
they
make
good
tenants.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
enough.
