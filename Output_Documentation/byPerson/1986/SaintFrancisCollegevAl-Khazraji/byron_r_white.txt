justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
race
issue
was...
rather
than
national
original
was
before
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
we
are
reviewing
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals,
so
i
am
not
sure
the
pleadings
have
got
much
to
do--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
court
of
appeals
said...
went
on
a
racial
ground,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
will
discuss
it
on
a
racial
ground.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
doesn't
have
in
his
allegations
or
in
his
proof
things
that
are
in
the
prior
case
that
was
argued--
justice
byron
r.
white
--namely,
that
he
was
discriminated
on
the
grounds
of
race
because
that
was
the
intent
of
the
people
who
fired
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
that
the
decision
was
made
because
they
thought
that
he
was
of
different
race.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
his
argument,
you
say,
is
that
he
claims
to
have
been
discriminated
on
the
grounds
of
race
but
concedes
he
is
not
of
a
different
race?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
did
the
court
of
appeals
come
to
such
a...
make
such
an
error
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
ethnicity,
that
may
be
different
from
race,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
applied
the
statute
too
broadly
if
it
applied
it
just
to
ethnic
groups.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
this
person
was
denied
tenure
to
make
room
for
an
asian,
say,
he
could
stake
a
good
claim
under
mcdonald.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
to
make
room
for
a
negro.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
we
know
what
the
facts
are
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
a
white
person.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
his
claim
is
that
he
was
discriminated
against
because
he
was
ethnically
different.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
his
claim
must
include
discrimination
based
on
ethnicity,
on
his
different
ethnic
character,
because
he
concedes
he
is
not
different
racially.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
third
circuit
wouldn't
protect
germans
on
that
basis.
justice
byron
r.
white
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--or
irish.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
swiss.
they
model.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
1866
act
[inaudible]
all
citizens,
all
persons
born
here
are
declared
to
be
citizens,
and
such
citizens
of
every
race
and
color--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
the
word
"race"
is
in
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
defending
the
court
of
appeals
judgement
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
you
are
not
defending
it
totally?
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
test
was
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
and
you
don't
agree
with
that
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
discriminating
against
somebody
he
is
a
son
or
because
she
is
a
daughter
of
a
felon?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
may
make
a
lot
more
sense
than,
say,
swedes
and
norwegians.
there
is
a
lot
of
discrimination
against
yankees
in
the
south,
and
probably
against
southerners
in
the
north.
why
wouldn't
that
be
covered?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
am
wondering
if
you
want
to
win
the
case.
you
say
the
court
of
appeals
was
just
wrong
in
its
test,
although
you
won
under
the
test.
you
say
please
don't
adopt
that
test,
use
this
one,
so
if
we
agree
with
you
about
the
court
of
appeals
but
disagree
with
you
on
your
test,
your
client
is
going
to
lose.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
isn't
much
of
a
refining.
you
just
reject
the
court
of
appeals
test.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
wouldn't
mind
us
saying
that,
i
suppose,
as
far
as
the
third
circuit
went
it
was
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
certainly
don't
argue
that
if
a
person
is
ethnically
identifiable
and
has
these
physical
characteristics,
that
you
shouldn't
discrimination
against
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
just
want
to
argue
some
other
case.
that
is
all.
you
just
object
to
the
fact
that
the
third
circuit
seems
to
have
limited
the
coverage
to
those
characteristics.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
that
right,
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
want
to
argue
somebody
else's
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
be
very
happy,
i
suppose,
if
you
said
we
just
don't
reach
the
question
of
whether
the
statute
is
any
broader
than
that.
we
know
we
were
urged
to
do
so
by
counsel,
but
we
just
don't
reach
it.
we
don't
have
to.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
just
leave
it
open,
just
leave
it
open.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
ought
to
be
happy
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
ms.
mitchell,
i--
--i
think
the
third
circuit's
test
is
subsumed
in
yours.
justice
byron
r.
white
part
of
it?
ms.
mitchell,
aren't
you
really
suggesting
a
sort
of
national
origin
test?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
would
give
a
remedy
to
some
person
who
discriminated
against
someone
because
he
was
from
sweden
but
the
person
says,
well,
i
know
the
swedes
are
not
of
a
different
race
at
all.
i
haven't
any
racial
animus
against
them.
i
just
don't
like
swedes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
would
go
back
and
say,
well,
just...
you
would
say
that,
well,
if
that
plaintiff
was
well
advised
he
would
know
that
he
really
is
discriminating
on
a
racial
basis
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
it
could
be
that
there
is
racial
retaliation
or
religious,
violent
religious
conflict.
that
could
be,
but
that
wouldn't
be
covered
by
1982.
