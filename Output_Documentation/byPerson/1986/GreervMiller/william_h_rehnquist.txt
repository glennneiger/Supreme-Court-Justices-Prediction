chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-2064,
greer
against
miller.
mr.
rotert,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
any
doyle
violation,
i
mean,
has
to
be
based
on
some
constitutional
shortcoming,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
are
you
saying
that
here
there
was
no
constitutional
shortcoming?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
then...
concomitantly,
that
means
there
was
no,
"doyle"
violation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
sometimes
it
isn't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
does
the
constitution
say
about
breach
of
promise?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
in
effect
that
if
the
state
courts
have
concluded
there's
a
constitutional
violation
but
it
was
harmless
under
chapman,
and
the
federal
court
agrees
as
to
what
the
constitutional
violation
was,
it
may
not
then
reexamine
the
chapman
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
said
it
may
not;
you
say
it
should
not.
is
there
any
difference
between
those
two?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you're
saying
it's
a
question
of
fact
under
the
section
of
the
habeas
statute
that
says
you
have
to
defer...
the
federal
court
has
to
defer
to
state
court
factual
determinations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
even
a
fact
question
can
be
reviewed
by
the
federal
court,
given
unusual
circumstances.
you're
putting
the
harmless
error
determination
even
further
from
review
than
a
fact
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
there
is
duplication
of
constitutional
inquiry
in
almost
every
area
of
constitutional
law
and
habeas
corpus.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rotert.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
peterson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
he
was...
but
the
witness
was
not
allowed
to
answer,
was
he?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
if
the
comment
is
only
in
the
form
of
a
question
to
the
witness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
says
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
wasn't
there
argument
in
doyle
to
the
jury?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
constitutional
violation,
which
kind
of
fundamental
unfairness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
mean,
you
just
described
two
different
kinds
of
fundamental
unfairness.
which
is
the
constitutional
kind?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it
doesn't
take
a
whole
lot
of
reworking
of
those
cases
to
say
that
perhaps
there
isn't
a
constitutional
violation
until
there's
prejudice.
especially
when
prejudice
was
so
obvious
in
doyle.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
mean,
it
doesn't
take
a
whole
lot
of
revisionist
approach
to
doyle
to
say
that
not
every
so-called
"doyle"
quote
violation
is
constitutional?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
peterson.
mr.
rotert,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rotert.
the
case
is
submitted.
