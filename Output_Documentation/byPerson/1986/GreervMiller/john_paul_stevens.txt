justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
interrupt
with
one
question?
does
this
argument
that
you're
now
making
apply
equally
whether
the
challenge
is
made
on
direct
review
or
on
collateral
attack?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
peterson,
i
suppose
your
best
example
would
be
if
there
was
fundamental
unfairness
by
asking
the
question
and
the
jury
acquitted
him;
there'd
be
no
prejudice
there,
but
you'd
have
your
fundamental
unfairness.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
peterson,
could
i
interrupt
there?
if
you
agree
that
harmless
error
analysis,
even
under
a
chapman
standard,
is
appropriate
for
a
federal
judge,
necessarily
doesn't
that
entail
some
inquiry
into
credibility
of
witnesses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
i
think
in...
i
think
in
most
harmless
error
cases,
i
think
of
the
hastings
case
which
came
up
from
the
seventh
circuit
too,
there
were
a
lot
of
witnesses
who
testified
to
the
guilt
of
the
defendants,
but
in
finding
the
error
harmless,
the
court
must
have
decided
their
testimony
was
worthy
of
belief.
generally,
you
know,
there
weren't
photographs
taken
of
what
happened.
they
were
oral
descriptions.
justice
john
paul
stevens
whenever
there's
overwhelming
evidence,
a
lot
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
is
oral
testimony.
and
i
suppose
if
you
believe
the
prosecution's
witness
here,
you
could
find
the
evidence
overwhelming.
