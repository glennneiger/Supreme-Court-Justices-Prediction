justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
obviously,
it
was
in
doyle,
because
of
the
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
had
no
occasion
to
say
whether
prejudice
was
essential.
justice
byron
r.
white
which
one
of
your
two
arguments
would
you
rather
have
us
adopt?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
on
your
chapman
on
habeas
argument,
you'd
never
got
to
your
first
question.
because
i
suppose
you
would
argue
that
even
under
your
standard,
which
would
involve
a
prejudice
component
before
there's
a
due
process
violation,
once
a
state
court
has
determined
that
there...
that
there
isn't
any
prejudice
and
no
violation,
that
wouldn't
be
reviewable
under
federal
habeas?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
do
you
do
about
jackson.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
is
federal
judges
saying
that
no
reasonable
jury
could
have
found...
could
have
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty
in
this
case,
and
disagreeing
flatly
with
the
state
courts.
that's
what
jackson
authorizes
federal
courts
to
do.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
say
federal
judges
shouldn't
upset...
differ
with
the
factual
conclusions
of
state
court
judges.
justice
byron
r.
white
what...
what
do
you...
what
do
you
think
the
difference
is
between
you
and
your
opponent
with
respect
to
the
standard?
you
say
a
harmless
error
would
save
the
conviction.
your
opponent
says,
well,
there
has
to
be
a
prejudice
component
before
there's
even
a
constitutional
error.
you
think
the
latter
would
just
save
many
more
convictions
that
your
standard?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
have
standards
like
that
with
respect
to
some
constitutional
violations,
don't
we?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
wouldn't
it
be
appropriate
in
this
context?
justice
byron
r.
white
pretty
fundamental
right
at
stake
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that's
true,
you
wouldn't...
i
don't
know
why
you
would
be
so
worried
if
we
said
there
was
a
prejudice
component
to
a
constitutional
violation,
because
you
say
it
would
always
be
there.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
by
fundamental
unfairness,
i
take
it
you
mean
something
that
has...
makes
a
difference
about
the
outcome?
