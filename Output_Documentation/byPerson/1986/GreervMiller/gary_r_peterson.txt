mr.
gary
r.
peterson
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
has
suggested
that
this
court
adopt
a
broad
presumption
in
favor
of
harmless
error
in
doyle
cases.
in
so
doing,
the
state
has
not
mentioned
what
occurred
at
trial
in
this
case.
i
believe
an
examination
of
what
occurred
at
trial
will
reveal
why
such
a
broad
presumption
should
not
be
imposed.
at
trial
in
this
case
the
prosecutor
characterized
the
evidence
as
a
credibility
contest
between
the
state's
accomplice
witness,
randy
williams,
and
the
defendant,
charles
miller.
during
his
closing
argument
to
the
jury,
the
prosecutor
stated,
what
it
really
boils
down
to
here
is,
who
told
you
the
story
and
who
told
you
the
truth.
you
either
believe
randy
williams
or
you
believe
charles
miller.
it's
as
simple
as
that.
recognizing
that
the
outcome
of
this
case
was
dependent
upon
the
jury's
assessment
of
the
defendant's
credibility,
the
prosecutor
commenced
his
cross-examination
by
asking,
why
didn't
you
tell
that
story
to
the
police
at
the
time
you
were
arrested?
the
prosecutor's
comment
was
in
blatant
violation
of
this
court's
decision
in
doyle
v.
ohio,
and
it
was
extremely
prejudicial.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
the
doyle
violation
is
complete
when
the
prosecutor
comments
on
the
fact
that
the
defendant
remained
silent
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
such
comments
suggest--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--that
is
correct,
because
such
comment--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--doyle
itself
says
that.
in
fact--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--yes,
there
was.
but
i
think
the
court
indicated
in
doyle
that
the
attempt
of
impeachment
with
post
arrest
silence...
impeachment
doesn't
have
to
be
completed.
we
have
one
doyle
violation
here.
and
of
course,
if
the
prosecutor
reiterated
that
comment
to
the
jury,
we'd
have
more
than
one
violation;
we'd
have
more
than
one
comment
on
post
miranda
warning
silence.
in
this
case,
the
suggestion
of
the
fact,
or
the
comment
that
the
defendant
did
not
tell
his
story
at
the
time
of
his
arrest,
suggested
to
the
jury
that
if
the
defendant
were
innocent,
and
if
his
story
were
true,
he
would
have
told
it
at
the
time
of
his
arrest.
and
since
this
case
was
a
credibility
contest,
that
comment
was
extremely
prejudicial.
with
respect
to
the
doyle
issue
presented
by
the
state,
and
with
respect
to
the
harmless
error
application
to
that
doyle
violation,
i
think
it's
clear
that
the
due
process
clause
recognizes
not
only
fundamental
fairness
in
the
trial
as
a
whole,
but
fundamental
fairness
in
the
prosecutor's
relations
and
actions
within
the
criminal
justice
system.
doyle
held
it
is
fundamentally
unfair
for
the
police
to
implicitly
promise
the
defendant,
at
the
time
he
is
given
miranda
warnings,
that
his
silence
will
not
be
used
against
him,
and
then
for
the
prosecutor
to
come
back
at
trial
and
in
fact
use
that
silence
against
him
to
impeach
his
testimony.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
no,
we
are
willing
to
concede,
your
honor,
that
doyle
is
the
type
of
trial
violation
which
in
terms
of
looking
at
its
effect
on
a
trial
as
a
whole
may
sometimes
be
harmless.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
no,
fundamental--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--i
disagree.
it
violates
the
constitution,
because
it's
fundamentally
unfair.
but
this
court
has
recognized
that
constitutional
errors
may
be
subject
to
harmless
error
analysis.
in
this
case--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--the
harmless
error
analysis
goes
to
show
if
a
trial
as
a
whole
is
fundamentally
unfair.
the
doyle
violation
goes
to
the
question
of
whether
the
prosecutor's
conduct,
in
relation
to
the
defendant,
is
fundamentally
unfair.
certainly,
if
the
defendant's
conduct
in
relation
to
the
defendant,
is
fundamentally
unfair,
in
this
case
as
in
doyle,
and
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
that
that
error
contributed
to
the
conviction,
then
the
trial
as
a
whole
is
fundamentally
unfair.
but
i'm
willing
to
concede
that
where
the
state's
case
is
overwhelming
or
the
defendant's
story
is
implausible,
that
under
those
circumstances,
the
doyle
error
would
not
contribute
to
the
conviction.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
would
not
be
fundamentally
unfair.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
it
would
not
be
fundamentally
unfair
in
terms
of
the
trial
as
a
whole.
it
would
still
be
fundamentally
unfair,
the
fact
that
the
prosecutor
tricked
and
deceived
this
witness.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
fundamental
unfairness
in
this
case--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--they're
both
constitutional,
your
honor.
due
process
clause
established
fundamental
unfairness.
and
i
would
cite
this
court
the
cases
that
deal
with
coerced
confessions,
the
santobello
cases,
that
fundamental
fairness
is
no
different
in
this
case.
in
coerced
confessions,
the
prosecutor
tricks
or
the
state
and
the
authorities
trick
or
deceive
defendant
into
giving
a
confession.
that's
a
violation
of
due
process,
because
trickery
and
deception
are
fundamentally
unfair.
in
the
santabello
v.
new
york
situation,
where
the
prosecutor
enters
into
a
plea
bargain
with
the
defendant,
and
he
promises
him
he'll
recommend
a
specific
sentence,
and
when
the
defendant
is
then
induced
into
giving
a
certain
plea,
the
prosecutor
comes
back
and
recommends
a
greater
sentence
to
the
judge.
that
is
fundamentally
unfair.
and
i
would
submit
in
that
case
the
error
could
also
be
harmless.
because
the
defendant
comes
back,
let's
say
you
have
a
situation
where
the
prosecutor
agrees
to
recommend
the
minimum
two-year
sentence
in
exchange
for
the
defendant's
guilty
plea.
the
defendant
pleads
guilty.
the
prosecutor
then
recommends
a
six
year
sentence,
but
the
judge
gives
him
a
two-year
sentence.
in
that
case
the
fundamental
unfairness
would
be
harmless;
but
it
would
still
be
a
constitutional
violation.
the
question
is
whether
that
constitutional
violation
was
harmless--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--that's
true,
your
honor.
in
that
case,
there
would
be
harmless
error.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
well,
that
question
in
itself
suggests
to
the
jury
that
if
the
defendant's
story
were
true--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--i
think
that's
why
harmless
error
analysis
is
appropriate,
your
honor.
if
the...
if
the
prosecutor
asked
that,
it's
certainly
a
constitutional
violation--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--no,
i
disagree.
every
doyle
error
is
a
constitutional
violation,
but
that
error
may
not
be
prejudicial
in
terms
of
its
effect
on
the
trial
as
a
whole.
in
that
case,
it
would
be
harmless
error.
that's
not
the
case
in
this
case
where
the
trial
is
a
credibility
contest
between
the
defendant
and
the
state's
accomplice
witness.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
i
think
the
latter
standard,
the
standard
suggested
by
the
state,
is
virtually
impossible
to
show
in
terms
of
harmless
error
analysis.
the
standard
suggested
by
the
state,
that
the
error
probably
would
affect
the
outcome,
and
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
the
error
would
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
certainly,
judge...
justice
white.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
with
respect
to
cases
such
as
strickland
v.
washington--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--it
certainly
is,
and
united
states
v.
bagley
is
another
situation.
in
those
cases,
there
is
no
constitutional
violation
until
the
prejudice
has
been
established.
in
this
case,
it's
clear
from
this
court's
decision
that
a
constitutional
violation
has
occurred.
now--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
well,
perhaps
not.
but
i...
such
a
revision
would
violate
the
constitution.
because
every
doyle
violation
violates
fundamental
unfairness
in
terms
of--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--the
deprivation
here
is
the
deprivation
of
the
defendant's
right
to
have
a
fair
trial.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
there's
a
denial
of...
if
he's...
if
he's
found
guilty
based
upon
a
fundamentally
unfair
conduct
of
the
prosecutor,
and
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
that
that
conduct
contributed
to
his
conviction.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
i'm
sure
that
can
be
said
with
regard
to
all
constitutional
errors,
if
it's--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--well,
in
every
doyle
case,
there
is
going
to
be
an
effect.
because
there
is
the
suggestion
that
the
defendant,
if
he
was
innocent
and
if
his
story
were
true,
that
he
would
have
told
that
story.
there
is
going
to
be
a
prejudicial
effect
in
every
case.
however,
i
have
conceded
that
that
effect
may
be
harmless
in
some
situations.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
prejudicial
effect
will
always
be
there,
that's
correct.
but
the
state
is
arguing
that
a
different
standard
should
be
applied,
and
that
makes
a
substantial
difference.
i
don't
think
it
makes
a
difference
in
this
case,
because
we
have
pointed
out
that
even
if
the
state's
standard
is
adopted
in
this
cases,
the
defendant
would
still
prevail.
in
this
case
we
have
the
benefit
of
the
trial
judge's
comments
upon
the
evidence.
the
trial
judge
stated
at
the
close,
or
following
the
trial
in
this
case,
that
this
case
was
a
swearing
match
between
mr.
williams
and
mr.
miller.
the
trial
judge
stated,
fortunately
for
the
state,
they
believe
mr.
williams;
unfortunately
for
the
defendant,
they
believe
mr.
williams.
the
trial
judge
also
stated
that
it
could
have
gone
just
the
other
way.
and
he
was
commenting
on
the
weight
of
the
evidence
when
he
said
that.
under
those
circumstances,
where
the
trial
could
have
gone
either
way,
it's
the
word
of
one
man
against
another.
the
doyle
violation,
and
the
prejudicial
effect
of
that
violation,
shifts
the
weight
of
that
evidence.
so
it's
more
likely
than
not
that
the
defendant...
that
it
did
affect
the
outcome
of
the
trial.
and
i
point
out
that
not
only...
well,
let
me
say
this.
the
state
has
argued
that
to
establish
the
standard,
it
would
probably
would
have
been
different.
you
have
to
look
at
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses,
and
the
defendant
has
to
show
that
the
jury
probably
would
have
believed
his
rather
than
the
state's
witness.
this
standard
is
simply
impossible
to
administer.
because
this
court
has
recognized
that
it's
not
the
duty
nor
the
function
of
the
federal
habeas
court
to
examine
the
credibility
and
weigh
the
credibility
of
witnesses.
that's
the
function
of
the
trial
court.
he's
the
only
person
in
a
position
to
observe
the
demeanor
of
witnesses.
fortunately,
in
this
case,
you
have
the
benefit
of
the
trial
judge--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--no.
as
in
a
case
like
this,
as
the
state
indicates,
in
order
to
establish
harmless
error,
they
must
show
the
evidence
is
overwhelming.
here
we
say
it's
a
credibility
contest.
but
for
us
to
prevail
in
this
type
of
situation,
the
state
says
we
have
to
show
the
jury
probably
would
have
believed
one
witness
rather
than
another.
we're
not
resolving
credibility
in
the
harmless
error
case.
under
the
state's
standard,
you
have
to
resolve
credibility
to
show
that
the
defendant
probably
would
have
been
acquitted.
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
certainly,
and
i
think--
mr.
gary
r.
peterson
--well,
it's
one
thing
to
say
that
when
you
have
a
presumption
of
constitutional
error,
the
error
occurred
in
this,
you
can
show
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
there
if
the
evidence
is
close,
if
the
evidence
is
conflicting,
then
it's
not
harmless.
and
that's
the
case
we
have
here.
the
evidence
is
conflicting,
and
under
the
state's
theory,
you
have
to
resolve
that
conflicting
evidence.
it
requires
the
federal
district
judge
to
go
into
the
record
and
attempt
to
resolve
the
conflicts
in
the
evidence,
assess
the
credibility
of
witnesses;
and
he's
not
able
to
do
that,
because
he
hasn't
observed
the
demeanor
of
those
witnesses.
now,
although
i've
indicated
it's
almost
impossible
to
meet
this
standard,
i
would
say
the
standard
has
been
met
in
this
case,
because
not
only
was
this
one
man's
word
against
another,
but
there
were
substantial
reasons
for
disbelieving
randy
williams.
as
the
trial
court
stated
during
defendant's
motion
on
a
directed
verdict,
the
trial
court
stated
that
mr.
williams'
testimony
is
not
necessarily
credible;
and
in
fact,
williams
was
an
accomplice
witness.
and
as
this
court
has
indicated,
accomplice
witness
testimony
is
suspect,
because
of
a
motive
to
shift
the
blame
to
someone
else.
and
the
jury
in
this
case
was
instructed
accordingly.
they
were
instructed
that
williams'
testimony
should
be
subject
to
suspicion,
and
should
be
scrutinized
with
care.
it
would
also
indicate
that
mr.
williams'
testimony
with
regard
to
the
defendant's
involvement
in
this
crime,
was
implausible.
williams
testified
that
he,
his
brother
rick,
and
butch
armstrong
left
a
jacksonville,
illinois
tavern
at
1:30
one
february
morning
in
the
company
of
the
victim.
williams
and
his
cohorts
had
been
drinking
for
12
hours
prior
to
this,
and
they
had
recently
ingested
a
narcotic
substance
known
as
mda.
according
to
williams,
they
all
got
into
the
car,
they
drove
over
to
his
brother
rick's
house
and
left
rick
off.
he
continued
to
drive
around
until
armstrong
and
gorsuch,
the
victim,
were
in
the
back
seat.
during
that
time,
armstrong
administered
a
severe
beating
to
the
victim.
and
they
put
randy
williams'
stocking
hat
over
the
victim's
head
so
the
victim
could
not
see
where
they
were
taking
him.
they
took
him
to
randy
williams'
residence.
there,
they
obtained
randy
williams
shotgun.
they
loaded
that
shotgun.
they
obtained
his.32
caliber
revolver,
which
was
also
loaded,
and
while
at
the
residence,
according
to
williams,
armstrong
struck
the
victim
over
the
head
with
the
butt
of
the
shotgun.
there
was
so
much
blood,
williams
was
unable
to
clean
it
up
with
the
towel.
he
went
back,
the
victim
still
hooded,
they
went
back
in
the
car,
drove
around
some
more,
and
according
to
williams,
they
finally
came
to
the
defendant's
residence.
doesn't
know
what
time
this
is,
and
the
testimony
is
very
vague,
but
it's
still
dark
out.
according
to
williams,
armstrong
went
in.
he
awoke
mr.
miller
up
from
a
sound
sleep,
and
miller
comes
out
to
the
car.
according
to
williams,
they
then
drive
off
to
a
bridge
and
take
turns
shooting
the
victim
in
the
head
with
the
shotgun.
i
submit
that
it
is
difficult
to
believe
that
an
individual
who
has
absolutely
no
motive
to
kill
the
victim
would
be
awakened
from
a
sound
sleep
in
the
middle
of
a
cold
february
night
and
that
within
a
few
minutes
be
out
on
a
bridge
shooting
someone.
on
the
other
hand,
mr.
miller's
story
was
not
implausible.
he
stated
that
they
came
to
his
residence
after
they
killed
gorsuch,
and
there
was
really
no
reason
to
disbelieve
him,
except
for
the
state's
suggestion
that
if
he
were
innocent
and
if
his
story
were
true,
he
would
have
told
that
story
when
he
was
arrested.
in
addition,
as
the
opinions
of
the
lower
courts
indicate,
williams
testimony
was
impeached
in
substantial
respects.
for
instance,
he
stated
in
a
post
arrest
statement
that
while
they
were
riding
around,
prior
to...
actually
he
stated
in
a
post
arrest
statement
that
after
they
picked
up...
that
armstrong
had
fired
a
revolver
into
the
backseat
of
the
car.
in
the
post
arrest
statement,
he
said
that
this
had
occurred
after
they
had
picked
up
miller.
but
if
that
was
true,
according
to
gorsuch,
the
gun
would
either
hit
miller
or
it
would
hit
the
victim.
he
changed
his
testimony
at
trial
to
say
the
revolver
was
fired
before
they
picked
up
the
defendant.
williams'
testimony
was
also
contradicted.
he
testified
that
the
evidence
indicated
that
the
victim
might
not
have
been
shot
at
the
bridge;
that
he
might
have
been
killed
by
a
pair
of
nunchakus.
there
were
nunchakus
hanging
on
the
wall
at
williams'
residence.
and
although
he
denied
using
them
to
beat
the
victim,
the
evidence
established
that
the
cause
of
death...
or
indicated
that
the
cause
of
death
could
have
resulted
from
a
blow
to
the
head
from
those
nunchakus.
for
these
reasons,
even
if
the
state's
standard
is
accepted,
i
would
urge
this
court
to
affirm
the
court
of
appeals.
thank
you.
