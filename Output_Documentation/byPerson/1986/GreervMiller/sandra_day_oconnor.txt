mr.
rotert,
i
didn't
see
that
this
was
the
question
presented
for
review,
what
you're
telling
us
this
afternoon.
i
think
i'm
understanding
you
to
say,
we
shouldn't
treat
a
doyle
error
as
a
determination
in
and
of
itself
that
there
has
been
any
error
of
a
constitutional
nature.
you
are
asking
us
to
reexamine
doyle
in
a
sense.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
thought
the
questions
presented
asked
us
to
reexamine
the
remedy
for
a
doyle
error,
to
wit,
whether
we
apply
the
chapman
standard
upon
this
error.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
strikes
me
that
might
be
a
better
idea
than
to
set
up
some
new
standard,
other
than
chapman,
if
you
find
there
has
been
a
violation
of
due
process.
i'm
just
trying
to
understand
what
it
is
you're
arguing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
is
your
argument
that
in
this
case
there
was
no
violation
of
due
process
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
on
federal
habeas
or
on
direct
review.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
shouldn't
we
ask
in
a
case
like
this
the
initial
question
of
whether
it's
fundamentally
unfair,
what
happened
here?
and
why
should
we
have
to
presume
it
in
every
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
shouldn't
we
at
least
ask
the
question?
you
can
argue
that
asking
the
question
was
somehow
prejudicial
to
the
defendant,
but
shouldn't
we
at
least
ask
that
in
every
instance?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
not
every
doyle
error,
then,
you
concede,
is
a
constitutional
violation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
i
understood
the
state's
attorney,
he's
taking
quite
a
different
view
and
saying
that
not
every
doyle
error
is
a
constitutional
error?
