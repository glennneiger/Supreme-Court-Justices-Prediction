why
is
that
any
less
logically
absurd?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean
isn't...
isn't...
you've
just
told
us,
once
you
find
a
doyle
violation,
that's
the
end
of
it.
and
once
you
find
that
there
has
been
a
lack
of
fundamental
unfairness,
there's
been
a
lack
of
fundamental
unfairness.
it
seems
to
me
the
logic
of
your
position
is
that
you
don't
make
any
kind
of
a
harmless
error
inquiry.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well
no,
i
didn't
understand
that.
so
every
doyle
violation
is
not
a
doyle
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
every
time
you
make
that
kind
of
a
statement
you
haven't
violated
doyle?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
every
doyle
case
involves
a
harmless
error
inquiry
before
you
even
find
a
doyle
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
are
you
saying
there
is
no
sort
of
harmless
error
analysis
in
doyle,
then,
under
no
standard
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
consistent
with
what
you
just
said.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
meant
it's
either
in
and
of
itself
fundamental,
or
it's
in
and
of
itself
not
fundamental;
now,
which
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
where
the
harmless
error
goes
to
showing
that
it
hasn't
been
fundamentally
unfair.
because
that
just
undoes
the
very
constitutional
violation
you
begin
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
so,
not
be
fundamentally
unfair?
justice
antonin
scalia
even
though
it
was
fundamentally
unfair?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
deprivation,
if
it
has
not
effect?
what
is
the
deprivation
of
life,
liberty
or
property?
i
mean,
that's
what
we're
talking
about,
right?
without
due
process
of
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
if
it's
had
no
effect.
he's
been
deprived
of...
he's
deprived...
you
mean
you
can
be
deprived
of
a
due...
of
a
trial
without
being
deprived
of
any
life,
liberty
or
property?
if
he's
acquitted,
you
acknowledge
there's
no
constitutional
violation,
right?
even
if
he's
acquitted
after
an
unfair
trial,
there's
no
constitutional
violation,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
if
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
that
it
contributed
to
the
conviction,
then
there's
a
reasonable
possibility
there
was
a
constitutional
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
only
those
which
hang
on
the
due
process
clause,
which
in
and
of
itself
requires
a
deprivation,
to
deprive
somebody
of
due
process,
of
life,
liberty
or
property,
you
have
to
show
that
whatever
happened
affected
a
deprivation,
which
puts
in
a
causality
element,
it
seems
to
me.
other
constitutional
violations
don't
have
any
causality
element;
they
just
say,
you're
entitled
to
an
attorney.
you're
entitled
to
confront
the
witnesses
against
you.
no
causality
required.
but
every
due
process
violation
has
causality
built
in,
doesn't
it?
so
it's
really
the
burden
of
the
defendant
to
show
that
there
was
some
effect
of
the
doyle
violation.
