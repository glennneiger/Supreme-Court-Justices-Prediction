mr.
mark
l.
rotert
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
your
honors,
the
petitioners
have
raised
three
issues
for
consideration
by
the
court
in
their
briefs,
but
today
i'm
only
going
to
discuss
the
first
and
the
second
issue,
and
i'd
like
to
divide
my
time
roughly
equally
between
the
two
issues.
first,
today,
i'd
like
to
discuss
the
first
issue
in
the
brief,
and
that
question
is
whether
or
not
it
is
always
inappropriate
to
attempt
to
apply
the
standards
of
chapman
v.
california
to
an
asserted
violation
of
due
process
of
law
that
arose
under
the
rule
of
doyle
v.
ohio.
and
the
petitioner's
position
in
this
regard
may
be
very
succinctly
stated.
we
believe
that
it
is
an
oxymoron,
and
an
inherently
contradictory
statement,
to
say
on
the
one
end
that
error
occurred
which
was
so
serious
that
it
rose
to
the
level
of
a
deprivation
of
due
process
of
law,
that
is,
it
rendered
the
trial
fundamentally
unfair,
but
then
on
the
other
hand
to
say,
we're
now
going
to
analyze
that
error
and
determine
whether
it
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
it
would
appear
that
the
use
of
terminology
that
an
error
rose
to
the
level
of
creating
fundamental
unfairness
answers
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
conviction
may
stand.
the
conviction
may
not
stand
in
the
face
of
such
fundamental
unfairness.
now,
there
are,
in
light
of
that
conclusion,
two
possible
results
that
can
obtain
when
there's
been
a
violation
of
the
rule
in
doyle
v.
ohio.
i
think
the
first
potential
result
was
that
apparently
accepted
by
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
of
the
en
banc,
and
also
appears
to
have
been
accepted
by
the
respondents
in
this
case.
that
theory
seems
to
operate
on
the
premise
that
once
a
prosecutor
utters
the
language
that
is
condemned
under
doyle,
that
is
in
this
case,
once
the
prosecutor
said,
why
didn't
you
tell
anyone
this
story
when
you
got
arrested,
the
deprivation
of
due
process
is
complete.
the
violation
of
fundamental
fairness
is
apparent,
and
there's
no
more
analysis
to
be
had
in
the
case.
well,
if
that
were
in
fact
the
rule,
it
would
be
an
unusually
harsh
rule.
it
would
read
more
facts
into
doyle
than
doyle
itself
contains.
it
would
create
a
rule
that
was
disproportionate
to
the
harm
suffered
by
the
defendant.
and
it
would
violate
this
court's
tradition
that
due
process
clause
cases
are
not
designed
to
deter
prosecutorial
misconduct.
therefore,
we
submit
that
the
more
appropriate
analysis
in
this
case
is
to
examine
a
violation
of
the
doyle
rule,
and
to
treat
that
examination
in
what
we
might
refer
to
as
the
traditional
due
process
model.
this
would
require
that
a
defendant
would
bear
the
burden
of
showing
that
when
the
doyle
violation
is
assessed
in
the
context
of
the
entirety
of
the
trial,
that
but
for
the
doyle
error,
the
results
of
that
proceeding
would
probably
have
been
different.
if
a
defendant
makes
such
a
showing
under
doyle
v.
ohio--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--well,
it's
very
similar
to--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--well,
i
don't
equate
the
violation
of
doyle
rules
with
a
violation
of
due
process
such
as
creates
a
fundamental
unfairness.
i
believe
if
doyle
is
read
as
a
case
that
was
decided
on
the
basis
of
its
own
unique
facts,
doyle
makes
some
implicit
assumptions.
one
of
the
implicit
assumptions
in
doyle
is
that
post-miranda
warning
silence
were
used
by
the
jury
to
draw
negative
inferences
about
defendant
doyle's
credibility;
that
resulted
in
a
breach
of
the
implicit
promise
of
miranda,
and
rendered
the
trial
fundamentally
unfair.
but
by
describing
doyle
in
that
fashion,
justice
scalla,
i
hope
i
have
demonstrated
that
there
are
more
elements
to
doyle
than
merely
looking
to
see
whether
the
prosecutor
commented,
in
the
presence
of
the
jury,
on
post-miranda
warning
silence.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
every
doyle--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--you
may
violate
the
rule
of
the
doyle
case,
but
that
does
not
end
the
inquiry
of
whether
or
not
you
have
violated
due
process
of
law
by
creating
a
fundamentally
unfair
proceeding.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
no,
it's
not
precisely
a
harmless
error
inquiry.
i
would
analogize
it
to
the
strickland
v.
washington
inquiry.
before
you
determine
whether
there
is
a
violation,
you
must
assess
prejudice.
prejudice
is
a
necessary
component
of
declaring
that
there
has
been
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law.
now
i
think
that
this...
this
proposition
that
i
proffered
to
the
court
this
afternoon
is
reflected
by
a
comparison
of
the
facts
of
doyle
with
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
it
does,
justice
stevens,
and
i
appreciate
that.
my
first
argument
says
that
doyle
violations
have
a
prejudice
requirement
no
matter
what
the
context
in
which
they're
raised.
my
second
argument
talks
about
the
specific
application
of
chapman
v.
california,
in
the
context
of
habeas
review.
it's
an
assuming
arguendo.
if
the
court
doesn't
believe
me
when
i
say
that
there's
a
prejudice
component
to
doyle,
if
the
court
agrees
with
the
majority,
in
fact,
the
unanimous
weight
of
the
federal
circuits,
that
chapman
applies
to
doyle,
then
i
think
we
have
to
take
a
look
at
whether
or
not
chapman
serves
a
utilitarian
function
in
habeas
corpus,
and
we'd
like
to--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--i'm
asking--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--well,
i
think
that
it...
the
question
presented
for
review
in
the
cert
petition,
if
i
may,
was,
whether,
when
considering
violations
of
doyle
in
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings,
which
takes
me
to
the
second
point,
the
standard
of
review
should
be
whether
the
error
substantially
affected
the
course
of
the
trial,
rather
than
whether
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
my
position
this
afternoon,
justice
o'connor,
is
that
the
question
should
be
answered
that
the
error
must
substantially
affect
the
course
of
the
trial.
please
understand,
i'm
not
requiring
or
even
requesting
that
the
court
reexamine
doyle
in
its
rationale.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
don't
believe
we're
looking
for
a
new
standard.
i
believe
we're
looking
for...
at
faithful
adherence
to
doyle,
but
i
don't
believe
that
doyle
was
a
case
in
which
this
court
had
an
opportunity
to
discuss
both
what
elements
constitute
a
violation
and
what
remedial
steps
are
required
if
there's
been
a
violation.
i
think
that
the
case
is
one
that
was
decided
on
its
own
facts,
and
including
in
those
facts,
i
would
remind
the
court,
the
state
of
ohio
expressly
declined
to
ask
the
court
for
a
remedial
determination,
a
determination
of
what
remedy
should
obtain
if
there
is
a
deprivation
of
constitutional
rights.
so
in
that
sense,
we're
not
asking
for
a
reanalysis
of
doyle.
we're
not
asking...
or
attacking
the
fundamental
premise
of
doyle.
we're
saying
that
doyle
is
subject
to
misconstruction
because
of
the
facts
and
circumstances
it
raised.
those
facts
and
circumstances
made
a
complete
deprivation
of
due
process.
what
happened
in
doyle
was
that
the
defendant
was
cross-examined
at
some
length
about
his
post
warning
silence.
and
as
justice
stevens
once
noted,
he
gave
a
jumble
of
answers.
he
got
hurt
on
cross-examination
because
of
his
post
warning
silence.
in
the
context
of
that
case,
it
should
also
be
noted,
that
the
prosecutor
argued
that
issue
frequently
on
closing
arguments.
he
directed
to
the
jury
the
inference
that
they
should
draw,
he
said,
was
that
there
was
a
concocted
or
fabricated
story.
i
think
that
the
court
in
doyle
had
no
occasion
to
stop
and
consider
when,
if
at
all--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--it
is
that,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
that
is
correct,
justice
o'connor.
yes,
my
argument
is
that
there
is...
there
is
an
attempt
by
the
prosecutor
to
violate
the
rule
of
doyle.
undisputed.
but
there
was
not
a
deprivation
of
due
process,
because
mr.
respondent's
trial
was
not
fundamentally
unfair.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
not
all
of
judge
easterbrook's
interesting
dissent
found
its
way
into
our
brief,
justice
blackmun,
that's
fair
to
say.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
not
on
this
particular
regard.
on
the
second
regard,
when
judge
easterbrook
questions
the
applicability
of
chapman
to
habeas
corpus
cases,
we
do
adopt
substantially
much
of
his
rationale.
we
take
a
different
approach
to
the
essential
doyle
question
itself.
now,
i
think
that--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--yes,
it
does,
justice.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
that's
correct,
because
there
wasn't
an
error
that
deprived
the
trial
of
its
fundamental
fairness.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
there
was
a
doyle
violation.
but
is...
the
question
i
would
present
is,
is
a
violation
of
the
rule
in
doyle
necessarily
and
always
a
violation
of
due
process
of
law
in
that
it
deprives
fundamental
fairness.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
precisely.
and
i
think
this
case
is--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--that's
correct.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
that's
exactly
right,
justice
white.
that's
exactly
what
i'm
saying.
and
here's
one
of
the
best
ways
to
illustrate
the
dichotomy
between
the
two
cases.
doyle
talks
about
the
offensive
constitutional
problems
that
come
up
when
there
is
a
breach
of
a
promise.
that's
very
suggestive
language
used
by
the
court
that
almost
calls
us
back
to
contract
principles.
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
breach
of
the
promise
possible
merely
by
virtue
of
the
unilateral
conduct
of
the
prosecutor.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
well,
there
is
a
position
that
can
be
taken
that
doyle
is
not
directly
rooted
in
any
specific
constitutional
principle.
it's
rooted
in
what
judge
easterbrook
called
the
bushwhack
theory.
you
shouldn't
tell
a
guy
that
he
should
be
able
to
remain
silent,
and
then
hurt
him
with
his
silence
later.
that
kind
of
fundamental
unfairness
is
perceived
as
undermining
our
confidence
in
the
accuracy
of
the
verdict.
but
the
point
that
i'm
drawing
is
that
unless
this
court
has
reason
to
conclude
that
the
jury
actually
inferred
negative
things
about
this
respondent's
post
warning
silence,
there
is
no
reason
on
which
you
could
conclude
that
there
was
a
breach
of
the
promise
implicit
in
miranda.
here
what
happened
was,
the
question
was
asked,
and
an
objection
was
immediately
sustained.
now,
admittedly,
the
judge
didn't
use
iron
clad
language.
he
said,
ladies
and
gentlemen
of
the
jury,
you
are
to
ignore
that
last
question
for
the
time
being.
but
the
record
also
demonstrates
that
later
that
very
same
day,
in
a
written
set
of
instructions,
of
which
this
instruction
was
on
the
first
page,
the
jury
was
told,
ladies
and
gentlemen,
you
are
to
ignore
questions
or
comments
or
evidence
as
to
which
i
sustained
objections.
this
jury
was
told
directly
twice
in
the
same
day,
once
orally
and
once
in
written
form,
don't
pay
any
attention
to
the
prosecutor's
attempt
to
talk
about
post
warning
silence.
there
is
no
basis
on
which
this
court
should
conclude
that
the
jury
drew
a
negative
inference
from
his
post
warning
silence.
there's
been
no
breach
of
the--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--no,
he
did
tell
them
in
a
written
instruction
later.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
not
on
that
particular
point.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
well,
justice
marshall,
that
point
might
be
well
taken
if
the
judge
had
said,
i
don't
know
what
to
do
about
this
objection,
i'll
tell
you
later.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
what
he
said
was
the
objection
is
sustained.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
well,
i
dispute
that
reading
of
the
record.
i
think
that
he
did
indicate
to
the
jury
that
they
shouldn't
consider
the
question.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
but
i
think
we
have
to
indulge
in
the
natural
assumption
the
jurors
in
this
case,
as
in
every
other
case,
followed
the
instructions
given
them
by
the
judge.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
beg
your
pardon?
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
your
honors,
the
second
issue
that
the
petitioners
have
briefed,
and
that
i
would
like
to
discuss
this
afternoon
is
whether,
assuming,
as
we
are
willing
to
assume
for
the
second
argument,
that
a
doyle
violation
gets
chapman
analysis,
we
submit
that
there
are
significant
policy
reasons
why
the
chapman
v.
california
stringent
standards,
to
demonstrate
that
error
is
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
do
not
provide
adequate
utility
in
collateral
review
to
justify
their
application.
now,
your
honors,
it's
fair
to
say
that
over
the
last
three
or
four
decades,
two
general
theories
have
obtained
in
this
court
concerning
the
essential
focus
of
the
purpose
of
habeas
corpus.
on
the
one
hand
there
has
been
the
theory
expressed
that
habeas
corpus
is
necessary
to
keep
the
state
courts
in
line,
to
make
sure
that
they
honor
the
principles
and
precedents
that
are
issued
by
this
court
on
the
federal
constitution.
a
second
theory
that's
been
noted
by
the
court
in
various
cases
more
recently
says
that,
no,
the
essential
purpose
of
habeas
corpus
is
to
see
to
it
that
there
are
no
fundamentally
unjust
convictions
obtained
in
the
state
courts
in
individual
cases.
we
believe
we
are
demonstrating
a
proposition
to
the
court
this
afternoon
that
materially
advances
both
of
those
interests.
now,
your
honors,
we
state
it
as
follows:
there
should
be
a
rule
from
this
court,
based
upon
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
states,
where
a
state
court
identifies
correctly
the
underlying
constitutional
principle
that's
at
issue
in
a
criminal
trial,
where
it
applies
the
governing
precedent
that's
on
point
as
issued
by
this
court,
and
if
it
determines
the
constitutional
error
arose,
it
then
determines
that
the
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
under
chapman
v.
california,
then
when
that
same
case
comes
to
the
federal
habeas
corpus
court
and
the
federal
judge
agrees
about
the
underlying
principle
having
been
correctly
identified,
agrees
that
the
governing
principle
or
precedent
was
applied
by
the
state
court,
the
only
question
then
remaining
for
the
federal
district
court
judge
is
whether
or
not
the
petitioner
in
that
habeas
corpus
case
can
demonstrate,
on
his
burden,
that
absent
the
error
the
results
of
the
proceeding
would
probably
have
been
different.
and
even
if
it
were
a
violation
of
griffin
v.
california,
the
kind
of
case
that
initially
gave
rise
to
chapman
v.
california,
if
the
state
court
had
afforded
a
chapman
analysis
on
direct
review,
no
useful
purpose
is
served
by
permitting
or
requiring
a
federal
court
to
indulge
in
that
analysis
on
collateral
review.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
believe
that
it
should
not
then
reexamine
the
question,
and
i
believe
that
this
court
should
fashion
a
rule
to
that
effect.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
yes,
because
this
court
has
reaffirmed
only
last
week
that
the
scope
of
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction,
as
a
matter
of
potential
power,
is
extraordinarily
broad.
but
that
power
being
as
broad
as
it
is
does
not
mean
that
this
court
will
give
the
habeas
corpus
jurisdiction
its
widest
possible
scope.
this
court
in
any
number
of
contexts
has
said,
even
though
we
have
the
jurisdictional
power
to
act,
we
will
act
according
to
our
assessment
of
what
it
means
under
the
interests
of
finality
and
under
the
interests
of
comity.
so
while
you
would
have
the
power
to
require
federal
courts
to
give
us
a
chapman
analysis
on
habeas,
you
also
have
the
power
to
say
we
shall
not
exercise
that
jurisdiction.
now
i
want
to
emphasize
that
there's
a
misconception
on
the
part
of
the
opponents
in
the
briefs.
we
do
not
assert,
by
the
argument
we
raise
to
that
court
today,
that
any
change
should
be
made
in
those
constitutional
cases
which
would
now
result
in
a
per
se
reversal.
for
example,
if
someone
had
no
attorney
under
the
gideon
case,
that's
a
per
se
reversal
case.
and
if
under
some
unfortunate
circumstance,
that
escaped
the
notice
of
the
state
court,
on
federal
court
per
se
reversal
rules
would
remain
viable
for
application.
but
what
we're
talking
about
are
the
applications
of
chapman
v.
california
to
habeas
corpus
cases
where
the
state
court
has
already
made
that
subjective,
fact-rooted
factual
determination.
now
the
reason--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--well,
no,
i
recognize
that
the
chapman
analysis
is
essentially
a
federal
question.
and
i
recognize
that
what
is
involved
springs
from
an
alleged
or
proven
violation
of
constitutional
principles.
but
i
do
assert
that
the
reason
in
this
case
that
this
conviction
has
been
vacated
and
a
new
trial
has
been
ordered
is
not
because
the
state
of
illinois
differs
in
its
view
of
the
constitution
from
the
federal
judiciary.
the
difference
in
the
two
opinions,
the
illinois
supreme
court
saying
it
was
no
problem,
or
at
least
not
reversible
error,
and
the
opinion
of
the
en
banc
seventh
circuit
saying
you've
got
to
give
mr.
miller
a
new
trial,
is
not
born
of
any
friction
between
the
courts
on
the
constitution.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
no,
i
don't
believe
i
am.
because
what
i'm
doing
is
saying
that
that
federal
question,
although
it
is
fact
based,
having
been
analyzed
once
in
the
state
court,
that
has
met
the
needs
that
are
found,
that
are
supposed
to
be
balanced
under
chapman
itself.
and
the
duplication
of
that
effort
is
not
materially
advancing
the
development
of
constitutional
law.
it
doesn't
provide
significantly
greater
constitutional
protections.
but
it
does
create
the
kind
of
situation
we
see
here.
there
are
no
2254(d)
problems
with
the
seventh
circuit's
opinion.
they
did
not
misstate
historical
facts,
and
they
did
not
accuse
the
illinois
court
of
misstating
historical
facts.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
but
the
duplication
of
effort
relates
to
the
meaning
and
the
extent
of
constitutional
rights
and
principles.
when
a
state
court
says,
we
don't
think
this
was
an
indirect
comment
on
his
right
to
silence,
and
so
griffin
doesn't
apply,
and
a
federal
court
comes
to
precisely
the
opposite
conclusion,
that
is
a
distinction
or
a
dispute
between
the
courts
on
the
meaning
of
federal
constitutional
principles.
the
dispute
and
the
distinction
that
arose
in
this
case
has
to
do
with
the
meaning
of
facts.
do
you
think
that
randy
williams
was
or
was
not
believable?
do
you
think
that
mr.
miller
was
or
was
not
believable?
i
believe
that
chapman
v.
california
expressly
says,
we
are
setting
up
a
balance.
on
one
side
we're
going
to
balance
the
interest
in
fundamental
fairness
in
the
trial
and
society's
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
fundamentally
fair
convictions
are
upheld,
and
against
that
we're
going
to
balance
the
surpassing
importance
of
the
constitutional
principles
we
see
in
the
fourth
and
fifth
amendment.
by
definition,
if
chapman
were
only
concerned
with
the
accuracy
of
the
trial's
result,
they
wouldn't
have
balanced
that
accuracy
factor
against
those
surpassing
importance
interests.
chapman
serves
a
broad
societal
spectrum.
it
is
intended
on
direct
review
as
a
judicial
remedy,
and
it
was
a
case
that
came
through
on
direct
review,
but
it
is
intended
to
strike
a
balance
that
is
appropriate
on
direct
review.
that
balance
must
be
recalibrated
when
we
get
to
collateral
review.
and
the
interests
that
chapman
serves
in
the
societal
function
are
not
the
same
interests
that
the
habeas
corpus
statute
serves
under
either
of
the
schools
of
thought
that
i've
identified
to
this
court.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
oh,
a
win
is
a
win,
justice
white.
i'll
be
happy
to
see--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--that's
correct.
mr.
justice
white,
of
the
two
arguments,
i
think
that
the
problems
associated
with
application
of
chapman
on
habeas
corpus
are
more
significant
to
the
various
50
states
than
the
problems
associated
with
a
rather
inaccurate
reading
of
what
doyle
v.
ohio
purports
to
say
about
the
due
process
clause.
now,
one
of
the
things
that's
noteworthy
about
the
chapman
standard
is,
according
to
this
court
and
according
to
the
lower
courts,
is,
that
if
a
state
in
this
case
wants
to
show
that
error
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
we
have
to
show
mr.
miller's
guilt
by
virtue
of
overwhelming
evidence,
a
quotation
taken
directly
from
any
number
of
decisions
by
this
court.
if
we're
going
to
apply
that
overwhelming
evidence
standard
on
collateral
review,
it
should
be
because
the
need
to
enforce
chapman
on
collateral
review
outweighs
the
costs
that
are
associated
with
that
enforcement
of
chapman.
but
in
point
of
fact,
that's
not
true.
the
benefits
of
applying
chapman
on
collateral
review
are
illusory.
there
is
no
dispute
here
between
the
illinois
appellate
court,
the
illinois
trial
court,
and
the
illinois
supreme
court,
all
three
of
which
said
doyle
error
occurred,
and
the
seventh
circuit,
either
en
banc
or
in
panel.
nobody
has
ever
disputed
the
presence
of
a
doyle
error.
all
we've
ever
done
is
quibble
back
and
forth
about
the
facts
of
this
case
and
the
meaning
to
be
drawn
from
those
facts.
if
it
is
true,
as
this
court
has
noted,
that
some
tension
arises
under
our
notion
of
a
federal
system,
by
virtue
of
a
fact...
by
virtue
of
a
federal
court
vacating
a
conviction
because
it
disagrees
with
a
state
court
on
the
constitution,
how
much
more
pronounced
is
that
friction
between
the
two
jurisdictions
when
the
vacation
of
the
conviction
arises
because
fair-minded
judges
in
the
federal
judiciary
read
facts
and
draw
different
conclusions
than
the
fair-minded
judges
of
the
state
judiciary.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
versus
virginia?
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
well,
i
don't
know
that
there
is
any
chapman--
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
--yes,
sir.
but
unfortunately,
jackson
v.
virginia
as
a
due
process
case
would
never
result
in
application
of
chapman
on
collateral
review
anyway,
so
it
doesn't
fit
into
the
analysis
i'm
talking
about.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
well,
to
the
extent
that
any
case
can't
exist
in
a
vacuum,
every
case
that
creates
a
constitutional
error
for
review
by
any
jurisdictional
court
has
to
be
decided
on
the
basis
of
its
facts.
but
when
we
don't
dispute
what
the
constitutional
rules
are,
or
ought
to
be,
and
we
merely
dispute
what
the
meaning
of
the
facts
are
under
those
rules,
then
i
think
it's
not
that
i'm
saying
that
chapman
has
absolutely
no
place.
i'm
saying
that
the
costs
of
the
application
of
chapman
are
pretty
significantly
higher
than
the
incremental
benefits
we
get
from
applying
chapman
on
collateral
review.
and
that
in
light
of
that
disbalance,
this
court,
as
it
did
in
other
contexts,
most
specifically,
stone
v.
powell,
should
reconsider
whether
or
not
that
application
is
warranted
in
the
future.
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
comments
this
afternoon
for
my
rebuttal.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
i
say
that
view
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
ruling
last
term
in
wainwright
v.
greenfield,
where
it
reestablished
the
constitutional
importance
of
doyle,
and
reestablished
that
due
process
is
violated,
that
fundamental
fairness
is
violated,
where
the
prosecutor
asks
the
defendant...
or
when
the
prosecutor
attempts
to
impeach
the
defendant
with
his
post
miranda
warning
silence.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
your
honors,
if
i
might
say
with
all
due
respect,
i
doubt
seriously
if
the
court
is
interested
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
verdict
in
this
particular
case
is
one
that
any
of
the
nine
members
of
this
court
would
have
voted
for
if
they
had
been
jurors
in
this
trial.
i
think
that
it's
sufficient
for
me
to
say
here
that
there
are
significant
problems
with
a
determination
that
randy
williams'
credibility
was
not
good
enough
to
support
this
conviction.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
for
randy
williams
to
implicate
chuck
miller
in
this
murder
would
have
been
suicidal
if
in
fact
chuck
miller
were
innocent,
because
all
that
randy
williams
could
hope
to
do
by
that
is
create
an
enemy
to
whom
he
had
recently
confessed
that
he
was
a
murderer.
so
i
think
without
belaboring
the
point
to
the
court,
a
fair
analysis
of
the
facts
suggests
that
this
is
what
judge
easterbrook
called
it,
a
close
case.
i'm
not
going
to
dispute
the
respondent's
assertion
that
this
is
a
credibility
contest.
many
criminal
trials
are.
but
i
doubt
very
seriously
that
the
court
wants
to
look
at
this
case
for
its
credibility
aspects.
your
honors,
i
think
that
one
point
that
might
help
understanding
the
petitioner's
position
is
that
there
is
a
difference
in
law
between
unfairness
and
fundamental
unfairness.
it
was
unfair
for
this
prosecutor
to
get
up
and
say
what
he
said
before
that
objection
was
sustained,
just
like
it
was
unfair
for
the
prosecutor
in
darden
to
call
the
defendant
an
animal;
just
like
it
would
be
unfair
for
a
prosecutor
to
have
exculpatory
material
in
his
file
and
not
turn
it
over;
just
like
any
number
of
instances
involving
unfairness
by
the
prosecutor
which
are
assessed
under
a
due
process
model
to
see
if
prejudice
resulted.
fundamental
unfairness
is
a
constitutionally
significant
term,
and
it
does
not
apply
to
the
circumstances
present
here.
and
i
think
to
the
extent
that
fundamental
unfairness
was
found
in
doyle
v.
ohio,
much
of
the
problem
that
lower
courts
have
had
is
in
mixing
or
confusing
unfairness
with
fundamental
unfairness.
mr.
mark
l.
rotert
that's
precisely
correct.
now
i
would
like
to
point
out
briefly.
doyle
is
a
case
which
has
had
a
tremendous
impact
on
the
trial
courts
in
the
states.
but
for
one
of
those
types
of
constitutional
criminal
procedure
cases,
it
hasn't
received
extensive
treatment
on
its
facts
from
this
court.
there's
doyle,
and
in
essence,
the
only
other
case
that's
directly
in
the
same
realm
as
doyle
is
wainwright.
but
i
want
the
court
to
be
very
cautious,
because
wainwright
is
a
case
involving
substantive
use
of
post
warning
silence,
a
situation
which
creates
unfairness
potential
that
is
significantly
different
from
what
is
seen
here.
finally,
to
the
extent
that
the
respondent
describes
our
standard
as
being
one
that
is
virtually
impossible
and
unworkable
for
that
reason,
that
must
be
distressing
news
to
this
court,
because
we
got
that
standard
from
this
court's
majority
opinion
in
strickland
v.
washington;
we
incorporated
it
wholesale.
so
to
the
extent
that
it's
attacked
for
not
being
feasible
or
realistic,
we
would
assert
to
the
court
that
the
circumstances
of
sixth
amendment
litigation
in
this
country
don't
bear
that
claim
out.
for
all
of
the
reasons
advanced
by
the
petitioners
this
afternoon,
we
urge
that
the
court
reverse
the
decision
of
the
en
banc
seventh
circuit
ordering
a
new
trial
for
this
respondent.
