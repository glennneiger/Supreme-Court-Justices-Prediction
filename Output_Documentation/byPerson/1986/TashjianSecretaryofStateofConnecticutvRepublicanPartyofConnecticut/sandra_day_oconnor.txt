oh,
i
see--
--you
mean
the
person
has
to
elect
a
party
affiliation
at
that
time
in
order
to
vote
in
the
primary
of
that
party.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
have
to
say,
i
am
a
republican
and
i
want
to
vote
in
the
republican
primary,
for
example.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gerson,
do
you
concede
that
a
political
party
does
have
a
protected
first
amendment
right
to
define
its
own
membership?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
reject
the
concept
that
there
is
any
first
amendment
right
at
stake
here
at
all?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
i
guess
the
party
is
taking
the
position
that
they
want
to
have
the
votes
counted
of
people
who
are
interested
enough
to
at
least
cast
their
vote
with
the
party
in
the
selection
of
candidates.
is
that
a
right
protected
by
the
first
amendment,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
court
were
to
determine
there
is
some
first
amendment
right
to
be
protected
here,
what
standard
or
test
do
you
think
we
would
have
to
employ?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gerson,
i
am
still
concerned
about
the
extent
to
which
there
may
be
a
first
amendment
interest.
in
the
democratic
party
case
i
guess
the
court
held
that
the
inclusion
of
people
unaffiliated
with
a
political
party
may
seriously
distort
its
collective
decisions
and
therefore
it
has
a
first
amendment
associational
right
at
stake.
now,
isn't
the
converse
true
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
certainly
there
is
language
in
the
opinion
to
the
effect
that
democratic
party
implicitly
assumes
that
freedom
of
association
creates
a
presumption
that
it
may
participate
in
deciding
who
votes
in
a
primary.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gerson,
it
seems
to
me
that
you
denigrate
unnecessarily,
perhaps,
in
your
argument
the
strong
interest
that
a
political
party
may
have
in
allowing
independents
in
this
case
to
vote
in
the
primary
because
they
are
sufficiently
aligned
with
the
party
to
permit
them
to
play
a
role
in
the
party's
decision-making
process,
and
it
would
seem
to
me
that
that
is
an
arguable
position
for
the
party
to
take.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
there
may
be
countervailing
state
purposes
here
that
can
outweigh
it,
but
i
just
wonder
whether
you
aren't
giving
too
little
credence
to
the
interests
at
stake.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
they
want
them
to
be
involved
in
the
most
important
function
of
all,
which
is
nominating
candidates.
