unknown
speaker
but
there
again
you
call
classic
a
white
primary.
unknown
speaker
okay.
unknown
speaker
how
does
it
invalidate
it?
unknown
speaker
so
there
would
be
a
different
problem
if
the
connecticut
law
applied
to
all
offices?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
gerson,
if
we
were
to
agree
with
that
submission
i
take
it
we
wouldn't
have
to
address
the
other
questions.
unknown
speaker
how
can
a
republican
party
rule
be
unconstitutional?
unknown
speaker
what
you
are
saying
is,
the
state
has
the
authority
to
foreclose
the
application
of
any
rule?
unknown
speaker
you
are
just
insisting...
you
would
just
be
insisting
that
there
be...
that
people
shouldn't...
can't
vote
who
are
ineligible.
unknown
speaker
the
constitution,
you
think,
requires
that
certain
people
be
allowed
to
vote
and
certain
people
not
be
allowed
to
vote,
and
you
are
enforcing
that
rule?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
republican
party
just
invited
to
their
state
convention
independents
and
put
in
the
primary
anyone
who
got
20
percent,
and
decided
only
to...
we
are
going
to...
we
are
not
going
to
have...
we
won't
need
a
primary,
we
are
only
going
to...
we
are
just
going
to
put
in
the
general
election
the
person
who
gets
the
most
votes
at
the
state
convention,
may
it
do
that?
unknown
speaker
all
right,
they
are
just
going
to
put
up
one
candidate
then,
and
we
have
a
primary
election.
everybody
votes
for
one
candidate.
unknown
speaker
well,
suppose
they
by
their
own
rule
just
nominate
one
candidate.
unknown
speaker
okay.
