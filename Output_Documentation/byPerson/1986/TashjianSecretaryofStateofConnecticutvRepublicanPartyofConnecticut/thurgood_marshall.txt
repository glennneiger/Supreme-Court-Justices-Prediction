--mr.
gerson,
do
you
agree
that
the
primary
is
an
integral
part
of
the
election?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
then,
the
state
has
the
same
right
over
that
that
it
has
over
the
general
election.
justice
thurgood
marshall
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
the
convention
is
not
a
primary.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
is
there
in
a
state
primary
that
the
state
cannot
regulate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
united
states
against
classic?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
classic
stands
on
its
own.
you
don't
have
to
compare
it
with
anybody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
said
that
the
primary
is
an
integral
part
of
the
election
machinery,
period.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no
qualifications
at
all.
justice
thurgood
marshall
smith
and
allwright
and
classic
were
two
different
cases.
justice
thurgood
marshall
one
was
racial
and
the
other
was
not.
justice
thurgood
marshall
please
don't
ask
me
to
do
it.
