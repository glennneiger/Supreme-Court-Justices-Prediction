mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
involves
a
conflict
between
section
9-431
of
the
connecticut
general
statutes
which
requires
that
persons
be
enrolled
members
of
a
political
party
when
they
vote
in
that
party's
primary
election,
and
a
rule
adopted
by
the
republican
party
of
the
state
of
connecticut
that
would,
contrary
to
that
state
law,
allow
unaffiliated
voters
to
vote
in
republican
primaries
for
united
states
senate,
united
states
house
of
representatives,
governor,
and
certain
other
state
executive
offices.
the
rule
would
not,
however,
apply
to
other
elective
offices
in
the
state,
including
state
house
and
state
senate.
the
issues
in
this
appeal
are
whether
this
law,
which
sets
voter
qualifications
in
a
major
party
state
primary
is
unconstitutional
simply
because
a
state
party
adopts
a
conflicting
rule,
and
whether
the
particular
rule
adopted
by
the
appellee
party
in
this
case
is
itself
violative
of
article
1,
section
2,
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
to
the
constitution.
when
connecticut
enacted
its
primary
electoral
scheme,
which
has
now
been
in
effect
for
greater
than
30
years,
the
legislature
thoroughly
debated
the
implications
of
the
various
electoral
codes
that
had
already
been
adopted
in
the
various
states.
connecticut,
in
fact,
was
one
of
the
last
states
to
adopt
a
primary.
the
legislature
selected
a
system
that
recognized
the
important
role
played
by
major
political
parties
in
the
electoral
and
governmental
process.
the
legislature
sought,
while
opening
up
the
process
to
the
party
rank
and
file,
to
at
the
same
time
maintain
party
responsibility
and
accountability
by
limiting
participation
in
primary
voting
to
party
members.
the
legislature
thus
struck
a
balance
between
a
convention
system
and
a
wide
open
direct
primary.
simply
stated,
the
law
in
this
case
allows
a
candidate
of
a
major
party
in
connecticut
who
obtains
20
percent
of
a
roll
call
vote
at
a
party
convention
to
wage
a
primary
in
which
all
party
members
may
participate.
connecticut
law
further
provides
for
automatic
and
preferential
ballot
access
for
major
parties.
the
primaries
in
connecticut
are
financed
by
the
state
and
its
towns
and
administered
by
the
state
and
its
towns,
and
enrollment
is
a
very
simple
process
involving
completion
of
a
short
form
up
to
noon
the
last
business
day
before
the
primary.
the
basic
point--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--it
is
synonymous
with
participation
in
a
party
primary.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
it
is
enrollment
for
purposes
of
the
primary.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
no,
it
does
not.
there
is
registration
to
vote
as
an
elector
in
the
general
elections,
but
enrollment
refers
to
enrollment
in
a
party
which
allows
one
to
participate
in
the
party
primary.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
that's
correct.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
justice
o'connor,
a
simple
form
simply
requires
statement
of
name
and
address
and
a
desire
to
enroll
in
that
party
for
purposes
of
that
primary.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
yes,
mr.
chief
justice.
enrollment
is
enrollment
in
a
party
list
which
allows
one
to
vote
in
a
party
primary.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
you
have
to
be
a
registered
voter
to
enroll
in
a
party
primary,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
you
may
be
a
republican
or
a
democrat
or
unaffiliated
voter.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
when
you
enroll
in
a
primary
you
are
then
listed
as
a
republican
or
as
a
democrat
or
as
an
unaffiliated
voter
for
purposes
of
any
other
election
unless
one
elects
to
disaffiliate
from
that
party,
which
is
also
a
very
simple
process.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
the
basic
points
i
wish
to
discuss
today
may
be
simply
stated.
first,
that
this
case
does
not
involve
the
merely
internal
affairs
of
a
private
association,
but
rather
the
public
electoral
functions
of
a
major
political
party,
that
the
state
has
a
real
and
substantial
interest
in
assuring
the
accountability
and
responsibility
of
the
major
political
parties
in
view
of
the
party's
major
governmental
and
electoral
roles,
that
the
decision
of
the
court
of
appeals
and
particularly
the
analysis
and
the
test
that
it
employs
have
profound
implications
for
the
electoral
codes
of
connecticut
and
all
the
other
states,
and
we
also
wish
to
demonstrate
in
the
particular
context
of
the
rule
adopted
in
this
state
the
significant
administrative
burdens
that
would
be
imposed
on
connecticut's
electoral
officials
if
this
rule
were
in
fact
implemented.
fourth,
that
there
is
no
real
showing
of
any
injury
to
the
constitutional
right
of
appellees
that
this
statute
has
caused.
the
state
is
merely
regulating
appellees'
interaction
with
people
who
do
not
want
to
join
them
in
membership.
and
finally,
we
will
argue
that
the
rule
itself
in
this
case
is
unconstitutional
as
violative
of
article
1,
section
2
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
of
the
constitution.
first,
we
wish
to
stress
that
this
case
does
not
involve
the
merely
internal
affairs
of
a
private
association
or
a
private
debating
society,
but
rather
the
public
electoral
function
of
a
major
political
party.
major
political
parties
dominate
the
electoral
process,
dominate
the
government.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
choices
that
voters
will
have
as
to
who
will
govern
them
are
made
when
the
major
parties
nominate
their
candidates.
accordingly,
people
have
a
right
to
say
through
their
elected
representatives
how
those
people
are
selected
and
what
electoral
system
best
promotes
governmental
goals.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
yes,
justice
scalla,
this
case
would
be
a
different
case
were
a
minor
party
or
petitioning
party
involved.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
no,
your
honor,
different
laws
apply
to
minor
parties
and
petitioning
parties.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
the
test
of
a
minor
party
is
whether
or
not
the
candidate
in
a
previous
election
has
received
1
percent
of
the
vote
for
that
office.
a
minor
party--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--that's
correct.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
thank
you.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
mr.
chief
justice,
just
to
further
elaborate
on
justice
scalla's
point
about
minor
parties,
as
i
stated,
a
party
qualifies
as
a
minor
party
by
receiving
1
percent
of
the
vote
for
an
office,
but
remains
a
minor
party
generally
until
that
party
receives
20
percent
of
the
vote
in
a
gubernatorial
election.
the
state
in
no
way
regulates
the
nominating
process
of
those
minor
parties.
as
i
was
indicating
before
the
recess,
this
case
does
not
involve
the
merely
internal
affairs
of
a
private
association
but
the
public
electoral
functions
of
major
political
parties.
when
a
major
party
is
participating
in
a
state
primary
election
it
is
performing
a
function
that
the
state
has
delegated
to
it,
and
the
state
then
adopts
that
party's
choice
by
automatically
and
preferentially
placing
the
nominee
of
that
party
on
the
general
election
ballot.
the
duties
assigned
to
major
parties
do
not
become
matters
of
private
law
simply
because
they
are
performed
by
a
political
party.
in
addition
to
the--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--justice
o'connor,
it
does
have
such
a
right
to
define
its
own
membership,
but
membership
in
a
political
party
is
not
equivalent
to
qualification
for
voting
in
a
party
primary.
what
is
involved
in
this
case
is
the
state
determination
about
who
may
participate
in
a
state
election.
membership
relates
to
the
internal
affairs
of
a
political
party.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
your
honor,
a
party
certainly
has
first
amendment
associational
rights
with
respect
to
its
internal
affairs.
the
party
is
free
to
determine
whatever
ideology
it
chooses,
whatever
platform
it
desires,
but
in
this
particular
case
the
associational
rights
of
the
party
are
not
implemented.
the
burden
on
the
party
here
is
at
most
an
incidental
one.
they
are
desiring
to
affiliate
with
people
who
by
their
own
voluntary
choice
are
indicating
they
do
not
want
to
be
members
of
that
party,
so
the
membership
question
in
this
case
is
not
one
that
directly
implicates
those
rights.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
think
it
is.
to
the
degree
it
is,
it
certainly
cannot
supplant
the
state's
major
interests
in
regulating
the
electoral
process.
the
state,
aside
from
its
electoral
responsibilities,
has
a
substantial
interest
in
ensuring
the
accountability
and
responsibility
of
major
political
parties
in
light
of
their
elective
role.
the
state--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--justice
o'connor,
in
the
context
of
a
challenge
to
an
election
statute,
a
state
statute
such
as
this,
the
appropriate
test
would
be
that
the
state
may
adopt
a
neutral,
nondiscriminatory
restriction,
and
such
a
restriction
is
constitutional
as
long
as
the
state
has
a
reasonable
regulatory
interest
with
the
burden
being
on
the
challenger.
the
test
adopted
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
context
of
associational
interests
of
private
associations
with
their
own
membership
really
has
no
applicability
to
the
public
electoral
function
in
this
case.
if
it
did,
it
would
invalidate
many
election
codes
across
the
country.
the
test
is
implicit
in
cases
of
this
court
such
as
anderson
against
celebreeze
where
this
court
recognized
that
election
codes
inevitably
affect
the
associational
rights
of
political
parties
or
candidates
or
voters
to
some
degree,
but
nonetheless
subjected
the
state
statute
to
a
much
lower
level
of
scrutiny,
indicating
that
the
state's
regulatory
interests
are
generally
sufficient
to
override
such
associational
claims.
the
issue
in
this
case,
unlike
the
way
in
which
the
court
of
appeals
framed
it,
which
was
asserting
that
the
state
was
arguing
that
closed
primaries
are
to
be
preferred
to
open
primaries,
is
not
that
at
all,
but
it
is
rather
who
makes
the
choice
as
to
whether
a
state's
primarily
electoral
system
will
be
an
open
system
or
a
closed
system
or
a
blanket
system
or
any
other
kind
of
system.
that
decision
has
implications
for
the
public
and
for
the
polity
at
large.
it
is
a
decision
that
does
not
go
only
to
the
internal
affairs
of
a
political
party.
indeed,
the
appellees
concede,
and
in
the
court
of
appeals
the
democratic
party
of
connecticut
stated
in
its
brief
that
if
the
republican
party
in
this
case
adopted
this
rule,
that
the
democratic
party
would
necessarily
follow
suit.
the
reasons
that
date
back
to
charles
evans
hughes'
original
recommendation
that
states
adopt
closed
primaries,
reflected
also
in
the
american
political
science
association
committee
on
political
parties
in
1950
advocated
closed
primaries,
was
not
because
those...
that...
charles
evans
hughes
or
the
apsa
believed
that
closed
primaries
improved
the
internal
operations
of
a
political
party,
but
rather
that
the
implications
of
a
closed
system
affect
the
state
at
large,
and
the
state
has
a
legitimate
if
not
compelling
interest
in
determining
what
kind
of
election
scheme
there
is
going
to
be.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
a
number
of
them,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
they
believed
that
a
closed
primary
is
more
compatible
with
a
responsible
party
system,
that
a
closed
primary
retains
membership,
the
incentive
for
membership,
and
therefore
is
very
important
in
leading
to
responsible
and
accountable
elected
officials.
without
party
membership,
there
is
a
much
looser
link
between
elected
officials
and
voters.
again,
though,
it
is
important
to
state,
and
the
legislative
history
in
1955
as
well
as
in
1985
reflect
the
judgments
of
connecticut
legislators
that
the
basic
decision
as
to
how
the
candidates
of
major
parties
are
to
be
selected
have
implications
far
beyond
that
narrow
party.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
absolutely,
justice
rehnquist,
but
then
again,
given
the
role
of
major
parties
in
our
states,
there
is
an
important
interest
in
the
state
ensuring
that
a
candidate
of
a
political
party
is
the
representative
of
that
party
for
a
citizen
or
for
a
voter
to
be
able
to
go
to
that
party
about
the
accountability
of
that
particular
elected
official.
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
making
these
kinds
of
determinations.
we
are
not
in
any
way
indicating
that
this
is
a
decision
that
is
appropriate
for
all
states.
other
states
in
light
of
their
own
interests
may
determine
for
different
reasons
that
an
open
primary
is
preferable
or
a
blanket
primary
is
preferable,
but
the
decisions
have
implications
well
beyond
a
party,
and
accordingly
that
decision
should
be
made
by
a
body
that
is
accountable
to
all
the
people
in
a
state
and
not
a
decision
that
is
just
made
by
a
political
party.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
an
independent
candidate
can
get
on
the
ballot
by--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--petitioning.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
again,
the
state
is
not
attempting
in
any
way
to
regulate
the
nominating
process
of
independent
candidates,
petitioning
candidates,
or
minor
parties.
it
is
because
of
the
fundamental
public
electoral
role
and
the
important
governmental
role
played
by
the
major
parties
that
the
state
has
a
legitimate
interest
if
not
a
compelling
interest
in
determining
how
that
system
shall
operate,
beyond
the
very
decision
as
to
what
kind
of
system
should
be
in
place.
if
the
decision
as
to
what
kind
of
elective
system
there
is
going
to
be
is
left
to
the
political
parties,
the
implications
for
the
electoral
administration
in
all
the
states
are
profound,
which
is
undoubtedly
one
reason--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--no,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
believe
it
is.
the
democratic
party
case
involved
the
extraterritorial
application
of
a
state
law
on
a
national
party.
there
was
never
any
question
in
that
case
whether
the
state
of
wisconsin
could
regulate
its
own
state
parties
and
its
own
state
elective
system,
and
similarly,
that
case
relied
on
the
cousins
case,
where
again
this
court
applied
strict
scrutiny
in
the
context
of
an
intrusion
into
the
internal
affairs
of
a
political
party.
that
is
not
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
justice
o'connor,
that
is
correct,
and
i
think
it
is
also
one
reason
why
this
court
has
repeatedly
recognized
in
election
cases
that
any
election
code
is
going
to
inevitably
affect
the
associational
interests
or
at
least
the
asserted
associational
interests
of
a
political
party,
and
if
the
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeals
were
adopted
by
this
court,
political
parties
would
essentially
have
a
veto
over
matters
that
are
now
the
sovereign
responsibility
of
the
state
with
respect
to
election
regulation.
the
state
of
new
york
in
its
amicus
brief
on
support
of
16
states
with
radically
differing
kinds
of
primary
election
systems,
closed
primary
and
blanket,
indicated
that
the
court
of
appeals
decision
had
the
prospect
of
undoing
100
years
of
election
law
reform.
under
the
logic
of
that
opinion
the
political
primary,
just
as
in
this
case,
it
is
arguing
that
it
is
somehow
opening
the
process,
could
just
as
easily
close
that
process
down.
there
would
be
nothing
to
stop
the
republican
party
or
the
democratic
party
or
any
other
major
party
from
saying
to
the
state
of
connecticut,
we
do
not
want
a
primary
at
all,
we
want
simply
a
convention.
or
we
do
not
want
a
20
percent
rule
in
the
challenge
primary,
we
want--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--the
only
thing
in
the
record
that
relates
to
the
administrative
burden
is
the
comment
by...
in
the
legislature
by
the
elections
attorney
for
the
state
that
this
system
would
be
workable.
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
in
any
way
that
the
system
would
not
have
enormous
problems
or
be
difficult
or
would
be
costly.
i
mean,
counting
ballots
by
hand
would
be
workable.
the
point,
though,
is,
regardless
of
the
administrative
burdens
imposed
by
this
particular
rule,
if
parties
could
dictate
what
the
qualifications
are
for
voting
in
primaries
elections,
electoral
regulation
would
become
characterized
as
a
form
of
regulation
that
a
state
engages
in
of
perennial
instability.
every
party,
every
election
could
adopt
different
determinations
as
to
who
may
vote
in
its
primaries.
it
would
be
one
thing,
although
the
administrative
burden
would
still
be
enormous,
if
what
was
involved
really
related
only
to
the
internal
affairs
of
that
political
party,
but
when,
as
here,
it
goes
to
how
the
basic
elective
system
is
going
to
operate,
which
has
implications
well
beyond
the
political
party,
it
seems
to
us
that
such
a
burden
clearly
outweighs
any
putative
associational
interests
in
this
case.
and
if
i
may
just
explore
what
the
associational
interests
are
in
this
case,
the
court
of
appeals
initially
indicates
that
the
burden
is
indirect
and
that
it
affects
the
rights
of
the
republican
party
to
some
limited
extent,
yet
somehow
transforms
that
indirect
limited
burden
into
a
massive
intrusion
into
their
rights.
yet
we
would
submit
that
by
any
reasonable
standard
the
burden
here
is
really
no
more
than
a
minimal
inconvenience
to
the
party
that
is
well
within
the
state's
article
1,
section
4
authority
to
regulate
the
time,
place,
and
manner
of
elections.
the
fact
that
voters
take
the
very
simple
step
of
enrolling
a
day
before
hardly
leaves
the
republican
party
of
connecticut
powerless
to
attract
voters
to
its
cause,
and
we
also
have
a
difficult
time
understanding
the
nature
of
the
interest.
absent
a
willingness
to
profess
an
interest
in
affiliation,
where
is
the
right?
without
a
commonality
of
interest,
where
is
the
association?
this
statute
does
no
more
than
regulate
the
parties'
interaction
with
people
who
do
not
want
to
be
members
of
the
party
for
purposes
of
voting.
the
state
is
not
preventing
unaffiliated
voters
from
voting.
there
is
no
disenfranchisement
involved
in
this--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--that's
correct,
justice
rehnquist,
but
we
would
have
to
say
it
is
just
by
hypothesis.
there
is
no
indication
in
this
record
that
there
are
unaffiliated
voters
who
are
clamoring
for
participation
in
the
republican
parties
in
connecticut.
quite
the
contrary.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
absolutely,
justice
scalia.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
the
state
in
no
way
is
questioning
the
sincerity
of
the
republican
party's
desire
to
open
up
its
primaries.
the
state
is
merely
asserting
that
the
decision
as
to
what
kind
of
primary
elective
scheme
a
state
is
going
to
adopt
is
a
decision
that
must
be
left
to
the
elected
representatives
of
all
the
people
of
the
state,
and
not
just
the
members
of
a
particular
political
faction
in
the
state.
the
implications--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--justice
o'connor,
again,
we
agree
that
the
republican
party
sincerely
and
conscientiously
is
arguing
its
position
that
it
desires
this
affiliation
that
it
is
now
not
allowed
by
the
state
party,
by
the
state
law.
nonetheless,
we
would
argue
that
there
is
nothing
preventing
the
republican
party
of
connecticut
from
involving
unaffiliated
voters
in
many
of
its
internal
affairs,
taking
their--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--justice
o'connor,
precisely,
but
that
most
important
function
of
all
is
a
state
function
performed
by
a
major
political
party.
it
is
not
a
matter
that
goes
just
to
the
internal
affairs
of
that
political
party.
mr.
chief
justice,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
will
be
brief.
i
would
first
like
to
comment
on
justice
stevens'
question
about
article
1,
section
2,
which
we
believe
does
clearly
invalidate
the
rule
that
the
republican
party
would
supplant
the
state
statute
with.
appellee
referred
to
oregon
against
mitchell
as
somehow
inconsistent
with
our
position.
the
holding
in
oregon
against
mitchell
relied
on
congress's
power
under
article
1
to
override
a
determination
by
the
state.
the
pertinent
opinion
in
oregon
against
mitchell
that
relates
to
the
state's
position
here
is
justice
stewart's
opinion
that
was
joined
by
justice
blackmun
and
chief
justice
burger
which
stated
very
clearly
that
the
states
are
not
free
to
prescribe
qualifications
for
voters
in
federal
elections
which
differ
from
those
prescribed
for
the
more
numerous
branch.
in
this
case
the
qualifications
differ.
article
1,
section
2,
and
the
seventeenth
amendment
invalidate
it.
if
there
is
any
point.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
it
invalidates
it
very
simply
because
many
voters
in
republican
primaries
in
connecticut
for
senate
and
house
of
representatives
would
lack
the
qualifications
for
voting
in
republican
primaries
for
the
connecticut
state
house
of
representatives.
electors
without
qualifications
to
vote
in
state
primaries
would
have
qualifications
to
vote
in
federal
primaries.
the
constitutional
language
of
article
1,
section
2
forbids
just
such
a
discrimination.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
if
the
rule
adopted
by
the
republican
party
in
this
case
applied
to
all--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--republican
offices,
then
article
1,
section
2
would
not
be
invalidated.
the
reason
it
is
invalidated
is
because
it
discriminates
among
offices,
and
that
is
a
very
good
illustration
of
how
constitutional
protections
begin
to
unravel
when
the
sovereign
authority
of
the
state
over
primary
elections
is
granted
to
political
parties.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
the
republican
party
rule
itself
would
be
unconstitutional
and
there
would
not
be
a
dispute
before
you.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
because
the
rule
itself
would
apply
in
a
state
election.
the
republican
party--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--of
an
unconstitutional
rule,
if
in
fact
that
rule
dictates--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--yes,
justice
white.
the
republican
party
rule--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--article
1,
section
2
says
the
qualifications
shall
be
the
same,
and
under
the
republican
party
rule
if
it
could
supplant
the
state
statute
they
would
not.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
no,
justice
white.
if
the
state
decides
there
is
going
to
be
a
primary
election,
that
is
a--
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
--i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question,
justice
white.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
by
their
party
convention.
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
and
if
they
did?
mr.
elliot
f.
gerson
under
current
connecticut
law
they
would
not
be
able
to
have
unaffiliated
voters
in
their
state
convention,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
before
the
court.
