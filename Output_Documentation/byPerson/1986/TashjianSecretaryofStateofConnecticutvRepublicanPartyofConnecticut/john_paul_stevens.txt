may
i
ask
if
under
your
view
the
republicans
could
invite
17-year-olds
to
vote?
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
the
theory,
as
judge
kaufman
explained
it,
part
of
it
was
to
get
the
ideology
of
the
party
reaching
out
and
getting
other
views
that's
necessary
to
vote
to
get,
i
don't
know
why
that
theory
wouldn't
apply
to
aliens
and
other
unregistered
voters.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
go...
anyway,
you
don't
go
that
far.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
golub,
all
they
have
to
do
is
publicly
enroll.
but
even
under
your
system
wouldn't
they
have
to
publicly
ask
for
a
republican
ballot?
and
there
are
watchers
at
the
polls.
they
have
to
identify
themselves
as
participating
in
the
primary
even
under
what
you
want.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
the
difference
between
publicly
doing
it
that
way
and
publicly
signing
an
enrollment
form
the
day
before.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
golub,
i
would
like
to
ask
you
another,
more
basic
question
that
we
haven't
touched
on
yet.
you
said
earlier
but
i
know
it
was
in
a
different
context,
that
the
primary
is
part
of
the
general
election
process,
and
if
you
make
that
assumption
for
purposes
of
reading
article
1,
section
2
of
the
constitution,
which
i
know
you
might
not,
accept,
but
just
make
it
for
a
moment,
is
it
not
correct
that
the
qualifications
requisite
for
electors
of
the
most
numerous
branch
of
the
connecticut
legislature
in
the
primary
include
party
membership?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
that
is
true,
and
if
the
primary
is
a
part
of
the
process,
why
doesn't
the
plain
language
of
article
1,
section
2
answer
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
yes.
