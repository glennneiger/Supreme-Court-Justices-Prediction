in

85-766,
julia
h.
tashjian,
secretary
of
state
of
connecticut,
versus
republican
party
of
connecticut,
et
al.--
mr.
gerson,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
say
enrollment,
is
that
synonymous
with
registration?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
is
enrollment
for
the
convention,
not
for
primary
voting?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
does
it
differ
in
some
way
from
what
in
other
states
would
be
called
registration
to
vote
in
the
primary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
under
connecticut
terminology
you
register
to
vote
in
a
general
election
but
you
enroll
to
vote
in
the
primary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
have
to
be
already
registered
to
vote
in
the
general
election
to
enroll
and
successfully
vote
in
the
primary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
gerson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
resume,
mr.
gerson.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
benefits,
mr.
gerson,
did
charies
evans
hughes
and
the
american
political
science
association
think
flowed
from
the
closed
primary?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
your
general
election
you
certainly
want
the
votes
of
the
people
not
unless
they
registered
in
the
primary,
so
anyone
who
becomes
an
elected
official
is
almost
surely
going
to
become
the
elected
official
by
virtue
of
votes
other
than
from
members
of
the
party.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gerson,
i
think
perhaps
your
opponents
might
argue
that
if
the
parties
were
to
take
that
drastic
a
position
there
might
be
much
more
serious
administrative
or
regulatory
consequences
to
the
state.
here
it
was
either
the
second
circuit
or
the
district
judge
found
that
the
administrative
burden
on
the
state
from
administering
the
kind
of
a
primary
that
the
republican
party...
would
not
be
great.
do
you
question
that
finding?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
by
hypothesis
don't
we
have
to
assume
that
some
people
are
going
to
vote
in
the
open
primary
that
didn't
vote
in
the
closed
primary?
otherwise
it
is
just
much
ado
about
nothing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gerson.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
golub.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
gerson,
some
of
your
answers
suggest
to
me
that
one
might
fairly
say
that
you
are
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
to
me
at
any
rate
the
horse
would
appear
to
be
the
general
election
where
the
state
provides
for
the
election
of
people
who
are
going
to
hold
public
office
in
connecticut,
and
the
parties
are
more
or
less
a
means
to
that
end.
but
some
of
your
answers
give
me
the
impression
that
you
think
that
these
kind
of
election
functions
are
kind
of
subordinate
to
the
functioning
of
the
party.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
wouldn't
agree
that
you
were,
but--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
golub,
then
you
would
say
in
a
state
like
wisconsin
where
the
state
mandates
an
open
primary
the
republican
party
could
come
up
and
say,
no,
we
want
a
closed
primary,
and
the
state
could
not
impose
an
open
primary
on
that
party.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
do,
too.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
does
it
differ
from
the
question
that
is
posed
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
so
good
about
that,
other
than
its
appeal?
0
[generallaughter.]
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
we
affirm
this
judgment,
and
the
republican
party
plan
is
therefore
put
into
effect
in
connecticut,
but
the
republicans
still
don't
elect
any
candidates
to
statewide
office,
so
the
party
at
its
next
convention
says,
instead
of
having
just
our
primary
open
to
independents
we
want
only
independents
in
it,
because
we
think
republican
voters
are
skewing
us
away
from
where
the
electors
are.
0
[generallaughter.]
would
that
be
all
right?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
golub.
do
you
have
anything
further,
mr.
gerson?
you
have
four
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
gerson.
the
case
is
submitted.
