if
you
have...
to
register
to
vote
in
the
general
election,
may
you
say
you
are
a
republican
or
a
democrat?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
an
independent.
but
your
enrollment
for
the
primary
purposes
does
not
change
your
designation
in
your
registration.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
have
registered
as
a
republican
for
the
general
election,
in
the
last
election,
then
your
registration
is
still
good?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
choose
to
vote
in
the
democratic
primary
it
doesn't
change
that
registration.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
you...
how
do
independents
get
on
the
ballot
in
connecticut,
or
do
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
petitioning?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
he
doesn't
need
to
belong
to
a
political
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
can
get
on
the
ballot
and
be
voted
for
or
against
without
ever
being...
belonging
to
a
party?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
golub,
if
the
state
law
said
to
each
party,
well,
you
may
have
an
open
primary
for
your
party,
or
you
may
invite
independents
to
vote
and
they
may
vote
in
your
primary,
but
provided
they
do
their
enrolling
the
day
before?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know.
justice
byron
r.
white
what's
wrong
with
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
any
more.
they
don't
have
to...
they
don't
have
to
do
anything
more
than
what
they
do
on
a...
what
the
party
wants
them
to
do
on
election
day.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
they
enroll.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
isn't
my
hypothetical.
i
say
he
doesn't...
they
say
independents
may
stay
independents
and
vote
in
the
republican
primary
if
they
just
enroll,
just
sign
up
the
day
before
and
say,
i
am
going
to
vote
in
the
primary.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
didn't
ask...
do
you
have
a
solid
answer
for
that
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
it
be
all
right?
would
it
be
alright
for
the
state
to
say,
go
ahead
and
vote
in
the
republican
primary
as
long
as
you
just
enroll
the
day
before?
you
stay
independent
but
you
just
let
the
party
know
or
let
us
know
also
that
you
are
going
to
vote.
justice
byron
r.
white
use
any
other
word
you
want,
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
no
problems
with
that
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
real...
the
real
problem
then
is
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
he
isn't...
in
my
example
they
are
not
insisting
on
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there's
a
law
that
says,
go
ahead
and
vote,
but
you
have
to
sign
up
to
do
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
suppose
you
would
sustain
a
state
law
that
said
you
can't
cross
over
or
that
republicans
can't
vote
in
a
democratic
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
party
said,
we
don't
care.
can
the
state
still
say
democrats
can't
vote
in
the
republican
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
guess
you
have
to.
i
guess
you
have
to
to
in
terms
of
your
position.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
the
republicans
choose
the
people
who
stand
for
election
at
the
primary?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
also
had
independents
sitting
in
their
state
convention.
