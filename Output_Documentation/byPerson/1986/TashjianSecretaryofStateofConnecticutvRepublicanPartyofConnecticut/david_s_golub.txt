mr.
david
s.
golub
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
there
are
two
fundamental
disagreements
between
the
parties
on
the
issues
in
this
lawsuit,
and
one
is
involved
with
the
questions
that
justice
o'connor
was
just
asking
mr.
gerson
about
the
nature
of
the
freedom
of
association
issue
in
this
case.
and
the
state
in
its
argument
today
has
characterized
it
as
one
based
on
membership,
that
it
is
an
attempt
to
force
people
who
don't
want
to
become
members
to
participate
without
assuming
the
mantle
of
membership.
that
is
not
the
freedom
of
association
issue
that
we
rely
on
solely.
it
is
true
we
want
them
to
participate.
it
is
true
that
the
republican
party
has
adopted
this
rule
in
the
ultimate
hope
that
independent
voters
will
become
members
of
the
party
in
the
future.
but
the
reason
the
rule
is
adopted
goes
beyond
that.
the
reason
the
rule
was
adopted
is
because
whether
or
not
independent
voters
become
members
of
the
party,
their
numbers
are
so
great
in
the
state
of
connecticut
they
outnumber
the
number
of
republicans
significantly.
the
present
numbers
are
700,000
democrats,
600,000
independents,
and
475,000
republicans.
whether
or
not
those
independent
voters
become
members
of
the
party,
their
participation,
whether
through
a
formal
affiliation
or
an
informal
affiliation
in
party
affairs,
their
participation
in
supporting
party
candidates
at
an
early
stage,
their
participation
in
helping
the
party
select
candidates
with
enough
popular
support
to
win
general
elections
by
getting
other
independent
support
or
even
support
from
other
groups,
those
kinds
of
feelings
were
what
prompted
the
republican
party
to
adopt
this
rule.
mr.
david
s.
golub
that's
right.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
think--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
think
that
is
the
critical
question
in
this
case,
because
whether
you
take
this
case
at
the
primary
level,
whether
you
take
it
at
the
convention
level,
whether
you
take
it
back
to
the
town
caucus
level
where
no
convention
is
necessary,
the
issue
is
what
degree
of
involvement
can
the
state
have
in
the
party's
determination
of
the
philosophy
of
its
candidates.
mr.
david
s.
golub
let
me
respond
directly
to
that,
because
i
think
the
state's
authority
to
act
is
limited
to
ensuring
a
fair
nominating
system
and
a
representative
nominating
system,
and
i
say
those
two
words
because
they
are
a
little
different.
we
have
to
back
in
history
to
how
the
state
first
developed
the
authority
to
even
insist
upon
primaries.
before
the
1900s
it
is
well
established
there
were
no
primaries.
but
the
reason
that
states
were
allowed
to
say
you
must
have
a
primary,
whether
it
is
a
direct
primary
or
a
challenge
primary,
was
because
party
bosses
were
preventing
a
fair
and
representative
decision
by
the
party
and
because
corruption
and
fraud
was
preventing
it.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
do,
and
i
say
that
knowing
that
it
involves
what
seems
on
its
face
to
be
an
incredible
position,
and
i
do
that
because
the
party's
right
to
pick
its
candidate,
pick
its
candidates,
and
the
method
of
picking
its
candidates
has
to
be
paramount
to
the
state's
rights
to
insist
that
a
candidate
reflect
a
certain
philosophy,
and
taking
that
a
step
further,
if
the--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--if
the
party
wants
to
abdicate,
if
the
party
chooses
to
put
up
no
nominee,
if
the
party
chooses,
as
the
party
does
in
new
york
from
time
to
time--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
am
sorry?
mr.
david
s.
golub
if
the
party
in
the
state
of...
if
any
party
in...
if
a
major
party
in
the
state
of
connecticut
said
at
its
convention,
we
unanimously
endorse
the
democratic
candidate,
the
state
would
have
no
requirement
of
insisting
upon
a
primary.
mr.
david
s.
golub
if
the
party
decides
that
that
is
the
best
way
for
it
to
get
into
power,
if
the
party
decides
that
that
is
the
best
way
for
it
to
attain
is
goals,
the
party
may
be
100
percent
wrong,
the
party
may
be
adopting
a
self-destructive
course,
but
it
is
not
for
the
state
to
come
and
say
we
won't
let
you
do
that.
mr.
david
s.
golub
what
the
party
has
done
in
this
case
is
open
up
its
system
to
make
it
more
representative.
we
recognize
that
the
party
is
limited
by
the
state's
authority
to
ensure
a
representative
nominating
process
or
a
fair
and
orderly
representing...
nominating
process.
and
in
a
sense
what
your
question
really
suggests
is,
supposing
the
party
adopted
a
rule
that
eliminated
a
representative
quality
to
its
candidate
selection
process.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
our
position--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--well,
i
certainly
agree
with
number
one,
fair,
and
number
two,
representative,
and
i
respectfully
have
to
maintain
the
position
that
if
the
party
wants
to
abdicate
or
make
a
mistake,
that
is
why
we
have
voluntary
private
parties,
so
that
other
parties
can
grow
up,
so
that
other
parties
will
develop,
so
that
a
majority
of
the
people
in
the
republican
party
who
agree
or
don't
agree
with
that
particular
course
have
the
option
of
saying,
okay,
we
will
do
that--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--well,
i
think
that
that
is
the
second
disagreement
between
the
parties
in
this
case,
parties
with
a
small
p.>
["]
and
i
think
that
what
the
state
has
asserted
within
the
rubric
of
"public
electoral
function"
is
a
right
to
impact
not
only
on
the
fairness,
the
orderliness
of
the
primary
procedure,
but
on
the
decisions
as
to
who
can
participate
in
the
primary
procedure.
we
agree
that
article
1,
section
4
confers
upon
the
state
a
right
to
regulate
elections,
and
i
think
we
also
agree...
this
has
not
been
articulated
exactly
this
way,
but
that
the
granting
of
ballot
access
to
the
republican
party
gives
the
state
a
right
to
go
beyond
that
back
a
step
to
before
the
general
ballot
is
implemented
to
the
nominating
system.
we
don't
agree
that
the
state
can
do
more
than
ensure
a
fair
and
representative
party
decision,
and
to
that
extent
i
am
putting
the
cart
before
the
horse.
i
wouldn't
put
it
that
way,
of
course.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
put
the
state's
cart
before
my
horse,
or
whatever
it
is.
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
agree
that
it
is,
and
i
agree
that--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
don't
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
we
agree
that
for
the
purposes
of
state
action
determinations
the
primary
is
such
an
important...
can
be
such
an
important
part
of
a
general
election
that
the
protections
of
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendments
apply,
but
we
don't
think
that
the
state
can
bootstrap
its
way
into
saying,
we
have
the
right
to
regulate
you,
we
force
you
or
we
require
you
to
participate
in
a
primary,
and
now
that
we
require
you
to
participate
in
a
primary,
since
that
is
a
"public
electoral
function",
we
can
now
insist
upon
your
participating
substantively
in
the
primary
with
the
members
or
the
voters
that
we
think
are
appropriate.
i
don't
think
anybody
would
say
that
the
state
could
regulate
the
people
who
attend
the
convention
or
the
people
who
attend
the
town
committee
caucuses.
mr.
david
s.
golub
that's
right,
and
we
don't
contend
it
is,
but
it
is
part
of
the
same
nominating
system
that--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--the
state
cannot
regulate
who
may
participate
in
the
primary
as
the
party
wishes.
mr.
david
s.
golub
no.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
that
the
state
has
a
right
to
establish
minimum
voter
qualifications,
which
have
traditionally
included
age
and
residency
and
other
similar
kinds
of
things.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
i
don't
go
as
far
as
the
second
circuit
opinion
went
in
that
regard.
mr.
david
s.
golub
the
rationale
that
i
would
use,
and
i
think
it
is
an
important
rationale
for
the
argument
i
am
advancing,
is,
going
back
to
the
representativeness
of
the
decision,
what
the
state
has
the
right
to
insist
upon
is
that
whatever
decision
the
party
ultimately
makes
through
its
primary
is
a
representative
decision
of
the
wishes
of
its
members.
if
the
members
say,
only
members
can
participate,
at
that
point
the
vote
in
the
primary
will
be
representative
based
upon
the
votes
of
the
members
in
the
primary.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
that
is
a
difficult
question.
mr.
david
s.
golub
fortunately,
it
is
not
posed
in
this
case.
but
i
have
an
answer
to
it.
mr.
david
s.
golub
it
differs
in
a
fundamental
respect.
our
rule
is
supportive
of
opening
up
the
system
of
participatory
democracy.
if
the
state--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
have
a
flag
in
my
pocket
to
wave.
we
think
the
state
can
make
determinations
about
what
is
necessary
to
ensure
the
representative
nature
of
its
parties'
decisions,
and
if
a
state
such
as
wisconsin
said,
in
order
to
ensure
a
representative
decision
we
have
to
have
open
primaries,
we
think
that
could
be
upheld
as
expanding
rather
than
restricting
the
party
functions.
there
is
no
case
in
this
court
that
has
ever
held
that
a
state
has
the
authority
to
restrict
a
party's
attempt
to
expand
associations,
memberships,
or
participation
in
its
processes.
that
includes
the
white
primary
cases,
which
of
course
dealt
with
the
parties'
attempts
to
exclude
voters,
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendment.
that
includes
the
disaffiliation
cases,
rosario
and
cusper,
which
dealt
with
an
individual's
attempt
outside
the
party
to
force
his
way
into
the
party.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
that
is,
to
an
extent,
part
of
what
is
involved
in
this
case.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
want
to
clarify
one
answer
that
was
given--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--what
we
think
is
wrong
with
it
is,
it
requires
independent
voters
to
make
a
public
affiliation.
in
the
context--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--no--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--the
answer
that
was
given
to
you
earlier
on
in
this
argument
i
don't
think
went
far
enough.
let
me
explain
to
you
my
understanding
of
the
relevant
statute.
statute
956
of
the
connecticut
general
statute
says
a
person
may
enroll
in
a
party,
an
unaffiliated
voter
may
enroll
in
a
party
at
any
time.
if
he
enrolls
in
a
primary
up
until
the
day
before...
noon
before
the
day
of
the...
the
day
of
a
primary...
i'm
sorry,
if
he
enrolls
in
a
party
up
until
noon
before
the
day
of
a
primary
he
may
in
addition
to
all
of
the
other
accoutrements
of
party
membership
vote
in
the
primary.
mr.
david
s.
golub
but
he
is
a
full
member
of
the
party.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
we
think
that
would
be
a
least
restrictive
alternative
that
might
be
applicable
if
the
court
finds
that
the
state
has
other
compelling
interests.
we
say
that--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--yes.
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
mean
to
avoid
the
question.
let
me
try--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--well,
i
have
trouble
with
the
word
"enrolling"
in
that
context.
if
it
is
only
announcing--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--okay.
if
it
is
only
announcing
an
intention
to
vote--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--which
could
be
for
administrative
reasons,
to
know
how
many
machines
to
have--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
have
no
problem
with
that.
mr.
david
s.
golub
the
problem
in
connecticut
is
that
there
is
a
traditionally
historical--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--the
problem
is
that
the
state
is
insisting
on
a
public
act
of
affiliation,
leaving
the
independent
status,
joining
the
republican
party
as
a
condition
of
this
association.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes,
i
am
sorry,
but
in
the
example--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
mean,
i
think
your
example,
if
it
was
necessary
to
administer
the
open
primary--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--yes,
as
long
as
the
state
showed
it
was
necessary
for
the
administration
of
the
primary
i
think
that
could
be
acceptable.
what
is
not
acceptable
is
forcing
voters
to
give
up
their
independent
status,
because
they
won't
do
it,
because
they
haven't
done
it,
whether
it
is
because
they
are
afraid
of--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--that's
correct.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
that
there
is
a
major
difference
philosophically
between
affiliating
with
a
party
formally
and
going
into
a
polling
booth
and
saying,
i
need
a
republican
ballot,
and
i
think
that
that
is
a
difference
not
only...
i
mean,
it
is...
i
mean,
there
are--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i,
of
course,
am
a
registered
democrat,
so--
0
[generallaughter.]
mr.
david
s.
golub
well--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
think
the
state...
the
state
could
view
it
that
way
if
it
wanted
to,
but
i
think
it
has
no
right,
and
this
is
where
i
fundamentally
part
with
the
state's
analysis
of
the
case.
the
state
sees
it
as
an
interference
with
states'
rights.
we
see
it
as
the
state
attempting
to
assert
authority
in
an
area
that
it
is
not
given
authority
by
the
constitution.
article
1,
section
4
does
permit
the
state...
does
authorize
the
state--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--it
may
be
that
my
definition
of...
i
need
to
define
my
definition
of
representative,
and
let
me
define
that
so
that
my
quibble
can
take
on
a
more
substantial
status.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
think
that
representative
in
the
context
of
the
private
rights
of
the
association
means
that
whatever
decision
is
voted
upon
is
voted
upon
with
the...
as
a
result
of
the
approval
of
the
majority
of
the
party
members,
and
if
a
majority
of
the
party
members
say
we
are
going
to
allow
this
kind
of
input,
that
is
still
a
representative
decision,
and
i
do
take
it
a
step
farther,
going
back
to
where
i
got--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--well,
that
is
the
difference
between
a
legislature
and
a
political
party.
a
political
party
could
say,
we
are
not
going
to
nominate
anybody
this
time.
a
political
party
could
say,
we
are
going
to
nominate
somebody
this
time
who
we
know
is
going
to
lose
because
in
the
future
that
race
will
help
us.
a
political
party
could
say,
we
want
to
build
something
now
so
that
in
the
future
we
will
be
a
different...
a
different
number,
or
a
different
philosophy.
the
party
has
the
right
to
do
all
that.
mr.
david
s.
golub
well,
at
that
point,
going
back
to
the
issue
of
representativeness,
the
party
votes
are
not...
i
mean,
the
party
members
have
no
longer
a
voice
in
the
party
primary
system.
mr.
david
s.
golub
yes,
but
the
party
has
determined
that
it
wants
the
input
from
independents.
mr.
david
s.
golub
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
though,
eliminates
any
party
participation
at
all
in
the
primary,
and
i
concede
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
require
a
primary.
mr.
david
s.
golub
no.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
go
farther
than
that,
and
i
think
that
there
is...
there
can
be
discrimination
through
dilution,
and
i
think
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
make
sure
that
there
is
no...
that
the
party
members
have
an
equal
right
to
participate
in
the
primary.
that
is
what...
there
is
no
claim
here
that
the
party
is
not
allowing
its
members
to
participate
in
the
primary,
is
not
allowing
its
members
a
full
vote
in
all
of
the
party
processes.
the
claim
by
the
state
is
that
the
party
can't
elicit
additional
support
from
groups
outside
the
party.
and
the
reason
we
think
that
that
is
so
fundamental
is,
if
you
have
a
minority
party,
and
not
just
in
connecticut
but
in
a
democracy,
the
way
a
minority
party
displaces
the
ruling
majority
is
by
forming
coalitions
with
other
groups,
whether
it
is
formal
coalition
so
that
the
party
grows,
whether
it
is
an
informal
coalition
of
two
groups
that
maintain
their
identity.
unless
you
allow
the
party
to
make
its
own
decision
about
who
it
can
associate
with
you
can't
displace
the
ruling
majority.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
would
sustain
a
state
law
that
intruded
upon
the
party's
decision
as
to
who
can
vote
in
its
process.
if
the
party
said
we
don't
want
democrats
to
vote
here,
only
independents
can
vote--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--well,
i
take
the
position
that
the
state
can't
say
that.
i
take
the
position
that
the...
and
i
have
to
do
that--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--to
be
consistent.
that
is
not
the
issue
before
this
court
right
now,
and
i
should
say
before
i
run
out
of
my
argument
that
whether
or
not
this
absolute
position
i
am
advocating
here,
and
it
is
an
absolute
rule
that
i
am
advocating
in
a
sense,
the
rule
that
in
the
absence
of
invidious
discrimination
a
party's
decisions
about
who
it
will
participate
with
is
absolute.
whether
or
not
that
rule
is
adopted
by
the
court
there
still
was
the
inquiry
performed
by
the
two
lower
courts
where
there
was
an
inquiry
into
the
sufficiency
of
the
reasons
the
state
adopted
under
the
familiar
compelling
state
interest
test
that
had
been
set
forth
by
this
court.
and
i
rely
on
that
as
an
alternative
basis
wholly
for
the
decisions
below.
but
answering
justice
white's
question,
my
answer
is,
the
party
has
the
right
to
associate
with
independents.
the
party
has
the
right
to
associate
with
democrats.
the
party
has
the
right
to
associate
with
any
qualified
voter,
so
long
as
it
is
not
done
to
discriminate
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendments.
mr.
david
s.
golub
all
right.
mr.
david
s.
golub
all
right.
first
of
all,
i
don't
agree
that
the
word
1,
section
2
applies
to
primary
elections.
mr.
david
s.
golub
okay.
and
that
is
set
forth.
and
i
think
that
this
court
has
held
that
that
is
the
law
also,
because
otherwise
oregon
versus
mitchell
was
wrongly
decided.
in
oregon
versus
mitchell
the
court
approved
18-year-old
voting
for
federal
elections,
federal
senate
and
house
elections,
and
21-year-old
voting
in
state
representative
elections.
and
if
that
language
in
article
1,
section
2
means
as
you
have
just
hypothesized
to
me,
that
decision
couldn't
stand,
because
that
would
be
a
different
qualifications
requisite
for
the
electors.
our
position
is
that
if
you
are
right...
if
the
state
is
right
that
electors
means
primary
elections
as
well,
that
the
purposes
of
that
were
to
ensure
that
there
was
no
restriction
of
the
right
to
vote
in
federal
elections,
not
just
to
require
straight
symmetry
of
the
qualifications,
and
that
is
satisfied
by
a
rule
that
expands
the
right
to
vote
in
federal
primary
elections
beyond
that--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--united
states
versus
classic
said,
as
i
read
that
decision,
primaries
are
an
integral
part
of
the
election
system.
therefore,
in
order
to
protect
the
right
to
vote
established
in
article
1,
section
2,
we
must
reach
out
and
allow
federal
control
over
primary
elections.
classic
did
not
say
that
article
1,
section
2's
reference
to
electors
includes
primary
elections.
what
it
said
was,
if
we
don't
protect
primaries
from
fraud
and
corruption,
then
the
right
to
vote
in
that
first
phrase
of
article
1,
section
2
has
no...
can
be
diluted.
and
that's
what...
if
you
compare
classic
with
ray
versus
blair,
in
ray
versus
blair
a
state...
the
republican
party
had--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
am
not
asking
the
court
to
impair
the
holding
of
classic
at
all,
but--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--and
i
agree
with
that,
but
i--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--i
agree
with
that
and
i
think
it
goes
beyond
that
to
say
that
because
the
right
to
vote
is
guaranteed
by
article
1,
section
2,
federal
control
of
the
primaries
is
sanctioned
under
the
aegis
of
article
1,
section
2,
but
no
one
has
ever
said
that
all
of
the
election
provisions
in
the
constitution
apply
to
primary
elections.
and
if
article
1,
section
2
through
classic
meant
that
there
would
have
been...
i
mean,
then
classic
would
have...
then
ray
versus
blair,
which
said
that
the
loyalty
pledge
that
violated
the
twelfth
amendment
of
electors
to
the
electoral
college,
that
ray
versus
blair
would
also
have
to
be
decided,
and
ray
versus
blair
specifically
addressed
this
issue
about
how
far
does
classic
go
and
how
far
does
smith
versus
allwright
go,
and
what
it
said
was,
those
cases
indicate
that
if
there
is
a
secured
right
being
violated,
as
there
was
in
smith
versus
allwright,
the
secured
right
under
the
fourteenth
or
fifteenth
amendments--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--yes.
i
agree
to
that
also.
mr.
david
s.
golub
we
are
not
asking
this
court
to
adopt
any
rule
that
in
any
way
impinges
the
law
of
classic
or
smith
versus
allwright.
mr.
david
s.
golub
i
am
not
asking
you
to.
i
say
that
in
all
seriousness,
because
the
position
we
have
taken
in
our
brief
is
that,
first
of
all
that
they
were
properly
and
rightly
decided,
and
second
of
all,
they
are
the
limits
on
what
the
party
can
do.
just
as
smith
versus
allwright
said
that
a
party
cannot
exclude
on
the
basis
of
impermissible
discrimination
voters
from
a
primary
system,
we
say
that's
the
limit.
we
can't
exclude.
what
the
state
here
is
doing,
and
i
say
this
respectfully,
is
using
the
white
primary
cases
for
the
flip
side,
which
they
don't
stand
for.
the
white
primary
cases
have
never
been
held
to
say
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
prevent
a
party
from
expanding.
mr.
david
s.
golub
not,
i
am
saying
smith
versus
allwright
and
terry
versus
adams--
mr.
david
s.
golub
--on
this
point.
the
state
is
saying
those
cases
allowed
the
court
to
restrict
a
party's
attempts
to
expand,
and
those
cases
said
just
the
opposite.
they
said
a
party
may
not...
it
said
the
state
may
restrict
a
party's
attempts
to
exclude.
that
goes
back
to,
in
a
sense,
where
we
started
with
the
argument,
that
what
the
party
is
trying
to
do
here
is
expand,
and
it
is
trying
to
do
that
in
a
manner
which
it
believes
is
representative
and
which
the
state
has
not
shown
to
be
unrepresentative.
i
recognize
that
the
state
has
discretion
in
making
judgments,
but
in
terms
of
deciding
where
it
can
interfere
with
a
party's
private
affairs
of
candidate
selection,
i
don't
think
that
there
is
deference
to
the
state's
judgments
when
they
interfere
with
what
are
fundamental
associations
of
who
and
how
people
may
participate
in
the
candidate
selection.
