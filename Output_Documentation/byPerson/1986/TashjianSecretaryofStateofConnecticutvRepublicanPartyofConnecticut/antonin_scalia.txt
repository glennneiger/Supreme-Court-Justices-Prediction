justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
this
weren't
a
major
party.
are
you
arguing
that
we
should
regard
this
provision
as
different
in
its
application
to
major
and
minor
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
does
the
law
apply
equivalently
to
minor
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
test
of
minor?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
very
major.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
republican
party
thinks
it
is
worth
a
lawsuit
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
have
to
believe
that
they
think
it
is
important.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
golub,
you
don't
contest
the...
indeed,
you
welcome
the
action
of
the
state
of
connecticut
in
giving
political
parties
a
prominent
role
in
their
electoral
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
political
parties
are
folded
into
the
electoral
process.
i
mean,
conceivably
they
could
run
it
without
political
parties.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
isn't
it
reasonable
for
the
state
once
it
has
let
political
parties
in
to
assure
that
they
are
functioning
as
political
parties?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
the
republican
party
decided
that
the
way
it
wanted
to
have
its
candidates
nominated
to
be
sure
of
winning
in
a
state
that
is
overwhelmingly
democratic
or
independent
is
simply
to
endorse
each
year
whatever
candidate
the
democratic
party
endorses?
all
right?
and
the
republican
party
by
convention
says
we
will
endorse
whatever
party...
whatever
candidate
the
democratic
party
endorses.
would
the
state
have
to
accept
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
doesn't
that
make
the
whole
party
system
a
charade?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
i
am
suggesting
is,
the
only
involvement
it
is
asserting
here
is,
all
we
want
to
be
sure
of
is
that
this
candidate
is
really
the
party's
candidate,
because
we
are
running
a
party
system,
and
what
you,
republican
party,
are
telling
us
is
that
you
don't
want
a
party's
candidate,
you
want
whatever
candidate
the
independent
voters
out
there
want
because
basically
you
want
to
win.
now,
the
state
is
saying
that
is
not
a
party
candidate.
the
only
thing
we
are
imposing
upon
you
is
that
you
be
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
first
hypothetical,
which
you
rejected,
was
fair
and
representative.
all
of
the
republican
party
unanimously
in
their
convention
say,
we
will
nominate
every
year
whatever
candidate
the
democratic
party
nominates.
you
tell
me
that
the
state
of
connecticut
has
to
accept
that
and
run
its
primary
system
on
that
basis?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
isn't
a
matter
of
reflecting
a
philosophy.
it
is
just
a
matter
of
insisting
that
the
party
not
abdicate,
that
the
party
function
as
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it
should
leave
the
primary
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
then
it
should
leave
the
primary
system.
the
state
of
connecticut
is
saying
our
primary
system
is
for
parties
and
we
want
candidates
who
are
nominated
by
the
party.
if
they
don't
want
to
nominate
anyone,
if
they
want
to
leave
it
up
to
another
party
or
to
independents,
well,
they
can
still
participate
in
the
election
but
not
as
a
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
my
hypothetical.
my
hypothetical
is,
we
don't
know
who
the
democratic
candidate
is
going
to
be,
but
we
will
beforehand
announce
that
we
will
endorse
whoever
the
democratic
party
endorses.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
not
concerned
about
its
being
self-destructive.
i
am
concerned
about
its
being
destructive
of
the
whole
purpose
of
a
party
primary
system,
which
is
what
the
state
is
trying
to
run.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
this
is
thoroughly
representative.
all
of
the
party
members
thoroughly
vote
that
we
want
to
abdicate,
basically,
we
will
endorse
whoever
the
democrats
endorse.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
i
am
saying
is
that
maybe
connecticut
has
a
right
to
ensure
that
it
be,
number
one,
fair,
number
two,
representative,
and
number
three,
a
genuine
party
choice
and
not
an
abdication
by
the
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
more
you
describe
the
difference,
the
less
i
like
it,
because
you
are
saying
that
is
it,
people
who
really
have
no
affiliation
with
the
republican
party
at
all,
in
fact,
they
are
deep
in
their
hearts
democrats,
they
can
come
in
and
they
will
cheerfully
select
the
republican
candidate.
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
my
problem
is
that
your
notion
of
what
it
means
for
the
state
to
assure
that
the
selection
by
the
party
is
a
representative
selection
is
a
strange
description
of
what
is
representative.
for
example,
under
the
federal
doctrine
that
congress
has
to
make
legislative
judgments,
we
don't
say
that
congress
is
making
the
legislative
judgment
it
has
to.
if
it
passes
a
law
saying
we
have
decided
that
the
executive
can
do
whatever
it
wants
in
this
field,
that
would
be
invalid
as
a
delegation
of
legislative
authority.
but
you
are
telling
me
that
this
is
not
a
delegation
of
the
parties'
responsibility
to
select
its
own
candidate.
if
the
party
says,
we
have
decided
not
who
our
candidate
is,
but
we
have
decided
that
independents
are
going
to
select
our
candidate,
that
is
not
a
representative
selection
by
a
party.
it
is
an
abdication
of
selection
by
the
party.
or
at
least
the
state
can
reasonably
view
it
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
acknowledge
that
the
state
has
the
right
to
assure
that
the
party
selection
be
a
representative
selection,
so
all
we
are
quibbling
about
is
whether
it
constitutes
a
representative
selection
to
say,
i
am
not
going
to
select,
i
am
going
to
let
somebody
else
select.
you
say
that
that
constitutes
a
representative
selection.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
applied
that
to
the
doctrine
of
unconstitutional
delegation,
we
would
have
a
quite
different
system
that
we
would
be
living
under
now.
you
wouldn't
think
that
the
congress
was
exercising
its
responsibility
to
represent
the
people
if
it
did
something
like
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
don't
know
that
they
have
a
majority
vote
under
the
present
system.
we
don't
know
how
many
independents
are
going
to
come
crowding
in.
the
way
you
describe
it
there
are
a
lot
more
independents
out
there
than
there
are
republicans.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
have
determined
under
the
chief
justice's
hypothetical,
too.
they
have
determined
that
they
want
the
independents,
just
to
be
sure
they
are
going
to
win,
they
want
the
independents
to
make
the
pick.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
has
to
be
at
least
a
minority
participation
of
the
political
party--
justice
antonin
scalia
--in
the
selection
of
its
nominee.
