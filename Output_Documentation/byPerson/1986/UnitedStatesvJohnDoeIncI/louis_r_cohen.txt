mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
first
question
presented
in
this
case
is
the
question
reserved
in
footnote
15
in
the
sells
engineering
case:
whether
attorneys,
in
this
case
in
the
antitrust
division
of
the
department
of
justice,
who
had
conducted
a
grand
jury
investigation
into
possible
bid-rigging
and
price-fixing
and
who
were
thereafter
instructed
to
consider
and
ultimately
to
bring
a
civil
action
for
injunctive
relief
and
damages
to
the
united
states
could
review
their
own
memoranda,
the
grand
jury
transcripts
committed
to
their
custody
under
criminal
rule
6(e)(1),
and
other
documents
properly
in
their
possession,
without
obtaining
a
court
order
under
rule
6(e).
when
respondents
were
notified
that
the
antitrust
division
had
decided
to
bring
a
civil
suit,
they
sought
a
protective
order
prohibiting
the
filing
of
the
complaint
on
the
ground
that
it
would
improperly
disclose
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
and
also
prohibiting
these
same
attorneys
from
referring
to
grand
jury
material
in
preparing,
filing,
or
litigating
the
civil
case.
the
district
court
denied
the
protective
order.
the
court
of
appeals
agreed
with
the
district
court
as
to
the
complaint,
finding
that
it
did
not
"quote
from
or
refer
to
any
grand
jury
transcripts
or
documents
subpoenaed
by
the
grand
jury,
and
does
not
mention
any
witnesses
before
the
grand
jury
or
even
refer
to
the
existence
of
a
grand
jury."
but
the
court
prohibited
any
further
access
to
grand
jury
materials
by
these
attorneys
without
a
rule
6(e)
order.
we
think
the
latter
ruling
was
error
and
that
government
attorneys
who
have
conducted
a
grand
jury
proceeding
and
who
have
been
directed
to
conduct
a
civil
phase
of
the
dispute
need
not
obtain
what
we
have
called
a
threshold
6(e)
order
before
they
may
review
grand
jury
materials
properly
in
their
possession.
to
begin
with,
the
plain
language
of
the
rule
prohibits
government
attorneys
from
disclosing
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
without
a
6(e)
order.
disclosure
occurs
when
information
is
revealed
to
at
least
one
new
person
and
not,
we
think,
when
the
same
people
review
their
own
memoranda
and
other
familiar
materials.
the
plain
language
we
think
is
well
chosen.
the
prohibition
of
disclosure
to
new
people
is
what
is
needed
to
serve
the
repeatedly
stated
traditional
purposes
of
grand
jury
secrecy:
to
shield
witnesses
and
the
grand
jurors
themselves
from
tampering,
to
prevent
flight,
to
protect
the
innocent.
that's
a
list
of
grand
jury
purposes
that
the
court
has
stated
repeatedly,
and
none
of
them,
we
think,
suggests
any
reason
why,
when
department
attorneys
who
conducted
a
attorney
investigation
are
available
to
bring
a
civil
case,
to
collect
money
owed
to
the
united
states
on
account
of
the
same
conduct,
and
they
can
do
so
without
disclosing
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
to
any
other
person,
why
in
that
situation
the
government
should
nevertheless
have
to
start
a
civil
investigation
from
scratch.
one
comment
the
court
of
appeals
made
on
this
was
to
echo,
but
really
extend,
a
point
that
this
court
made
in
sells,
the
concern
that
civil
use
of
grand
jury
materials
might
inhibit
witnesses
appearing
before
the
grand
jury
from
testifying
fully
and
candidly.
and
i
want
to
comment
on
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
that
can't
be
right
in
this
context.
in
the
first
place,
i
find
it
hard
to
imagine
a
grand
jury
witness
who
is
not
inhibited
by
the
threat
of
criminal
prosecution
and
is
not
inhibited
by
the
other
possibilities
for
disclosure
of
his
testimony
being
inhibited
by
the
fact
that
he
may
be
sued
civilly.
but
if
he
is,
it
seems
to
me
that
it
cannot
be
the
purpose
of
rule
6(e)
to
give
such
a
witness
the
false
impression
that
if
he
testifies
in
a
way
that
suggests
he
may
have
some
liability
to
the
united
states
that
won't
be
followed
up
and
the
united
states
won't
attempt
to
collect.
for
example,
in
this
case
the
assistant
attorney
general
in
charge
of
the
antitrust
division
received
at
the
end
of
the
grand
jury
investigation
extensive
memoranda
summarizing
the
investigation
and
making
recommendations
about
the
future
prosecution
of
the
case.
he
decided
on
the
basis
of
that
memorandum
that
a
criminal
prosecution
should
not
be
brought,
but
that
the
possibility
of
a
civil
case
should
be
further
explored,
and
that
civil
case
was
ultimately
authorized.
unless
we
are
to
have...
and
i
don't
think
the
respondents
are
asking
for
and
i
see
no
possible
warrant
in
rule
6(e)
for...
a
rule
that
the
grand
jury
proceedings
are
to
be
entirely
sealed
off
and
no
information
from
them
is
ever,
even
in
this
sense,
to
reach
anyone
who
might
consider
a
civil
case,
in
other
words
unless
we're
to
have
a
rule
that
says
the
assistant
attorney
general
who
decides
whether
or
not
to
bring
a
criminal
prosecution
may
not
thereafter
decide
whether
to
bring
a
civil
case,
there
simply
is
no
realistic
possibility
of
assuring
grand
jury
witnesses
that
what
they
say
may
not
be
used
against
them
civilly.
now,
the
respondents
we
think
would
like
to
go
beyond
the
traditional
purposes
of
grand
jury
secrecy
and
to
make
of
rule
6(e)
an
exclusionary
rule.
the
nub
of
the
problem,
it
seems
to
me,
is
right
there.
a
bona
fide
grand
jury
investigation
is
not
an
unconstitutional
search,
and
rule
6(e)
is
not
an
exclusionary
rule.
respondents
of
course
object
that
the
grand
jury
investigation
may
not
be
bona
fide,
that
allowing
grand
jury
attorneys
to
review
civil...
to
review
grand
jury
materials
during
the
civil
phase
may
lead
to
the
misuse
of
the
grand
jury
to
gather
evidence
for
civil
cases.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
argument
here,
finding
no
reason
to
think
that
the
attorneys
had
misused
the
grand
jury
in
this
case
and
no
incentive
for
misuse
in
any
antitrust
case,
in
view
of
the
division's
civil
discovery
powers.
and
i
can
add
that
i
think
such
misuse
is
rare
or
nonexistent.
but
in
any
event,
a
threshold
6(e)
order,
a
threshold
6(e)
proceeding
to
determine
whether
the
same
attorneys
can
participate
at
all
and
can
review
materials
properly
in
their
own
possession,
is
not,
i
suggest,
the
way
to
deal
with
any
such
misuse.
where
the
attorneys
who
conducted
the
grand
jury
are
also
conducting
civil
discovery
and
trial,
the
proper
moment
to
deal
with
a
claim
that
the
grand
jury
gathered
evidence
that
had
no
bona
fide
criminal
investigative
purpose
is
when
the
defendant
makes
such
a
claim
in
the
civil
proceedings.
defense
counsel,
who
frequently
will
have
lived
through
the
grand
jury
investigation
too,
will
not
be
slow
to
claim
that
the
grand
jury
gathered
evidence
that
was
not
relevant
to
a
proper
criminal
charge,
and
the
court,
having
the
same
attorneys
before
it,
can
immediately
inquire
into
such
a
claim
and,
if
it
proves
well
founded,
impose
an
appropriate
remedy.
the
alternative
implicitly
suggested
by
the
respondents
is
that
the
grand
jury
attorneys
should
be
required
to
go
to
court
for
a
threshold
6(e)
hearing,
which
would
presumably
be
ex
parte,
and
seek
to
demonstrate
that
the
grand
jury
proceedings
were
conducted
in
good
faith
and
did
not
gather
any
evidence
that
was
not
properly
part
of
a
criminal
investigation.
after
demonstrating
that,
presumably
they
could
review
the
materials
in
their
own
possession.
but
that
approach,
a
sort
of
presumption
of
irregularity,
is
not
called
for
by
6(e),
is
not,
we
suggest,
an
efficient
way
to
get
at
the
truth...
ex
parte
hearings
to
prove
a
negative
rarely
are...
and
will
not
dispose
of
the
matter,
because
the
defendant
will
still
have
the
right
to
make
his
claim
of
misuse.
respondents
also
object--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--we
think
that
6(e)
provides
that
those
persons
who
properly
have
access
to
grand
jury
materials
may
not
disclose
them
to
other
people
without
a
court
order.
that's
what
this
case
is
about.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
the
court
order
would
require
a
showing
of
particularized
need
under
this
court's
decision
in
sells.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
the
question
is
whether
any
purpose
is
served
and
whether
the
rule
requires
this
threshold
hearing.
respondents
argue
that
attorneys
on
the
prosecution
team
will
inevitably
disclose
the
workings
of
the
grand
jury
to
other
people
during
discovery
or
trial
of
a
civil
case.
that
objection,
i
note,
really
speaks
not
to
whether
such
attorneys
should
be
allowed
to
review
their
materials,
but
to
a
contention
that
they
are
not...
that
they
are
not
making,
whether
such
attorneys
may
participate
in
the
civil
case
at
all.
but
we
think
it
is
wrong,
for
two
reasons:
first,
they
greatly
exaggerate
the
likelihood
of
such
public
disclosure
by
misapprehending
what
it
is
that
is
required
to
be
kept
secret.
facts
about
persons'
conduct
do
not
become
privileged
merely
because
the
grand
jury
has
investigated
it.
what
is
secret
is
the
workings
of
the
grand
jury,
and
it
is
perfectly
possible
to
draft
a
complaint,
as
we
did
here,
that
does
not
tell
anyone
about
the
grand
jury,
and
to
conduct
discovery
and
trial
without
doing
so.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
and
that
is
not
what
i
meant.
thank
you
for
giving
me
an
opportunity
to
clarify
that.
by
the
workings
of
the
grand
jury,
i
mean
the
particular
activities
of
the
particular
grand
jury,
including
what
witnesses
it
heard,
what
those
witnesses
testified
to,
when
it
met,
what
documents
it
reviewed.
but
the
activities
of
the
grand
jury
as
such...
to
take
an
example,
a
pre-existing
document
which
is
subpoenaed
by
the
grand
jury
does
not
become
immune
from
later
disclosure
merely
because
it
was
subpoenaed
by
the
grand
jury,
unless
its
later
disclosure
would
disclose
something
about
what
the
grand
jury's
activities
were.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean
by
"go
out
and
say".
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
that
the
fact
that
a
particular
contract
was
subpoenaed
by
the
grand
jury
makes
that
contract
privileged
from
future
disclosure
in
circumstances
where
the
disclosure
would
not
reveal
what
the
grand
jury's
activities
were.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
on
the
other
hand,
the
same
testimony
can
be
elicited
in
discovery
or
in
trial
in
a
context
in
which
it
does
not
reveal
the
workings
of
a
grand
jury.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
again,
that
complaint
does
not
disclose
anything
about
the
activities
of
the
grand
jury.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
that's
of
course
not
the
case
here.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
now,
we
have
to
prove
our
case,
and
we
have
to
prove
our
case
by
admissible
evidence,
and
we
have
to
prove
it
by
disclosable
evidence.
but
such
a
complaint
could
be
filed,
and
to
the
extent
necessary
civil
discovery
could
then
be
conducted.
and
the
whole
case
could,
as
indeed
this
case
could--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--again,
i
think
the
answer
is
usually
yes,
they
could,
because
it
ought
to
be
possible
to
frame
an
answer
to
that
question
that
does
not
identify
the
grand
jury
proceedings
as
the
source
of
that
information.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
but
it
doesn't
identify
him
as
a
witness.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
we
don't--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it's
our
position
that
if
we
need
to
bring
in
another
lawyer
with
litigating
responsibility
and
that
lawyer
has
to
learn
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury,
we
need
a
6(e)
order
to
do
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
something
a
little
different
from
that
happened
in
this
case.
at
the
end
of
the
grand
jury...
excuse
me.
at
the
end
of
the
civil
investigation,
a
memorandum
prepared
by
the
two
attorneys
who
had
conducted
the
grand
jury
and
who
also
conducted
the
civil
investigation
was
forwarded
to
the
various
personnel
in
the
department
who
had
supervisory
responsibility
for
these
two
people
and
this
litigation.
most
of
those
personnel
were
the
same
people
occupying
the
same
positions
as
they
had
occupied
during
the
criminal
phase,
and
they
had
been
within
the
circle,
so
to
speak,
during
the
grand
jury
investigation
stage
of
the
proceedings.
two
of
those
people
were
new
replacement
people.
the
antitrust
division
considered
whether
it
needed
a
6(e)
order
for
disclosure
to
those
people
and
concluded
that
it
did
not,
the
theory
being
that
when
the
litigating
attorneys
have
proper
access
to
grand
jury
materials
they
should
be
able
to
report
to
the
senior
supervisory
personnel
in
the
department,
who
have
no
litigating
responsibility
but
reviewing
responsibility
for
lots
of
cases,
without
obtaining
a
6(e)
order,
because
otherwise
every
time
we
change
attorney
generals
or
assistant
attorneys
general
we'll
have
to
go
to
court
and
get
a
whole
lot
of
what
should
then
be
routine
6(e)
orders.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
it
raises
a
special
question
that
the
court
need
not
reach
in
this
case.
the
question
that
we
brought
before
the
court
is
whether
the
same
people,
the
litigating
attorneys,
may
continue
to
have
access
to
the
grand
jury
materials.
in
this
case,
there
were
two
further
disclosures,
which
were
not
considered
by
the
court
below.
i
might
add
that
i
think
that
they
were
palpably
harmless
both
to
the
public
interest
and
to
the
defendants.
but
i
suggest
that,
if
there
is
to
be
a
challenge
to
those
two
further
disclosures,
it
ought
to
be
initiated
below.
if
the
court
were
to
rule
that
we
can't
make
those
further
disclosures
to
senior
supervisory
personnel,
we
will
live
with
that.
that's
not
a
terribly
important
problem
for
us.
i
might
come
back
to
the
subject
of
documents
and
just
make
clear
one
thing.
after
the
grand
jury
investigation
was
terminated
in
this
case,
the
antitrust
division
issued
proper
civil
investigative
demands
under
the
antitrust
civil
process
act.
the
respondents
reserved
all
their
rights,
but
told
us,
one
formally
and
two
informally,
that
we
already
had
the
documents
under
the
civil
investigative
demands.
we
believe
that
we
now
hold
all
of
the
documents
that
we
hold
pursuant
to
proper
cid's
and
not
pursuant
to
grand
jury
subpoena
at
all.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
all
three
said,
we
have
previously
supplied
all
of
the
documents
covered
by
the
cid.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
we
accepted
it
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--we
issued
cid's
that
we
considered
were
valid.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
we
issued
them
saying
to
the
respondents,
you
may
respond
by
indicating
that
you
have
previously
supplied
documents
that
are
covered
by
this
cid.
and
all
three
of
the
respondents
did
that,
and
i
believe
that
we
wrote
them
back
acknowledging
that.
one
of
the
respondents
did
it
formally,
saying,
we
are
complying
and
what
we
understand
is
happening
is
that,
instead
of
your
shipping
our
documents
back
to
us
at
the
end
of
the
grand
jury
and
our
making
them
available
a
second
time,
we
are
simply
leaving
them
with
you.
the
other
two
interposed
various--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--argumentation,
but
then
said,
you
have
all
the
documents.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
not
a
phone
call.
we
are
entitled...
we
are
entitled
to
a
certificate.
we
in
this
instance
accepted
letters.
we
got
a
certificate
from
one
and
accepted
letters
from
the
other
two
saying,
you
have
all
the
documents
that
you've
asked
for.
the
other
point
i
wanted
to
make
under
this
head
is
that
the
problems
that
could
arise
during
discovery
and
trial
are,
we
suggest,
problems
that
not
only
may,
but
must,
be
left
to
be
dealt
with
in
particularized
6(e)
proceedings
or
other
appropriate
proceedings
in
the
court
where
the
civil
case
is
pending.
they
cannot
be
solved
by
requiring
the
government
attorneys
to
obtain
a
threshold
6(e)
order
giving
them
access
to
their
own
materials,
because
that
order
would
not
in
any
event
authorize
them
to
make
disclosure
to
any
other
person.
let
me
spend
a
moment
in
the
second
question
in
this
case.
we
did
seek
and
obtain
a
6(e)
order
for
purposes
of
conferring
with
the
civil
division
about
whether
it
would
be
appropriate
to
bring
a
6(e)...
excuse
me...
to
bring
a
false
claims
act
case
here.
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
that
order
on
the
ground
that
we
could
not
possibly
show
particularized
need
because
we
had
the
antitrust
civil
process
act
and,
although
it
might
be
hard
to
do
so,
we
could
duplicate
all
that
testimony.
it
said
that
may
be
expensive
and
it
may
take
some
time,
but
the
supreme
court
has
told
us
in
sells
that
time
and
expense
can
play
no
part
in
our
analysis.
we
think
that
was
just
a
straightforward
and
obvious
error.
we
accept
the
proposition
that
we
may
not
have
a
6(e)
order
solely
in
order
to
save
time
and
expense.
but
that's
quite
a
different
proposition
from
saying
that
time
and
expense
drop
entirely
out
of
the
equation,
so
that,
even
in
a
situation
where,
as
here,
the
time
and
expense
are
prohibitive
in
relation
to
the
use
that
we
want
to
put
the
materials,
we
are
denied
a
6(e)
order
and
therefore
the
ability
to
consult.
i'd
like
to
save
my
remaining
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
a
couple
of
points,
mr.
chief
justice.
first,
it
would,
we
believe,
have
been
possible
to
bring
and
try
a
civil
case
in
this
matter
without
public
disclosure
that
there
had
ever
been
a
grand
jury
investigation
of
this
conduct.
that's
true
notwithstanding
the
proceedings
on
the
issues
that
are
now
before
us.
there
was
no
disclosure
of
the
subject
matter
considered
by
the
grand
jury,
and
it
is
very
possible
that
no
reference
to
the
grand
jury
need
ever
have
been
made.
the
respondents
made
that
a
little
more
difficult,
because
they
filed
a
brief
in
the
second
circuit
which
identified
the
industry
and
the
foreign
country
involved,
but
that
was
the
first
and
only
public
disclosure
of
those
two
facts.
and
without
that,
it
would
have
been
possible
to
avoid
any
connection
between
this
case
and
the
grand
jury
at
all.
second,
the
problem...
substantially
all
of
the
problems
to
which
mr.
grand
refers
are,
as
was
suggested,
problems
that
would
arise
whenever
a
prosecutor
who
has
memory
of
a
grand
jury
is
allowed
to
participate
in
a
civil
case.
we
don't
think
the
problems
are
real,
but
in
any
event
they
go
to
a
point
that
he
neither
makes
nor
could
find
support
for
in
rule
6(e),
which
is
the
question
of
disqualification.
conversely,
as
i
said
before,
they
are
problems
that
would
not
be
solved
by
the
kind
of
threshold
6(e)
order
that
is
at
issue
here,
which
would
not
in
any
event
permit
such
disclosure.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
it
should
be.
for
31
years
when
the
rule
referred
only
to
disclosure
to
attorneys
for
the
government,
i
think
it
was
assumed
that
the
attorneys
for
the
government
would
occasionally
have
to
get
their
memoranda
summarizing
a
grand
jury
typed,
and
that
the
secretary
operating
under
the
supervision
of
the
lawyer
was
an
extension
of
the
lawyer.
i
want
to
respnd
to
the
assertion
that
there
was
no
showing
of
particularized
need
with
respect
to
the...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
doesn't
embrace
disclosure
by
attorneys
to
other
people
who
are
assisting
them,
such
as
economists
and
accountants.
and
the
court
in
sells
summarized
the
reason
why
3(a)(2)
was
added
to
the
statute,
and
it
was
not
to
cover
secretaries,
but
to
cover
other
kinds
of
personnel.
