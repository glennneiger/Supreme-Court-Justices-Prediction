justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
john
doe
case,
we
are
presented
with
two
questions
involving
the
federal
rules
and
civil
procedure
that
govern
the
secrecy
of
grand
jury
material.
after
the
grand
jury
had
completed
its
investigation
of
a
possible
antitrust
violation
and
had
not
returned
any
indictments,
the
government
attorneys
in
charge
of
the
investigation
thought
it
would
be
appropriate
to
bring
a
civil
case,
and
they
obtained
a
permission
from
the
district
judge
to
disclose
some
of
the
materials
to
lawyers
in
the
civil
division.
one
of
the
questions
whether
it
was
sufficient
particularized
need
for
that
disclosure
or
should
they
have
gone
through
civil
discovery
procedures.
the
second
question
is
whether
a
lawyer
who
participated
in
the
criminal
investigation
and
later
is
going
to
work
in
a
civil
case,
is
in
effect
making
an
un-permitted
disclosure
when
he
continues
to
use
the
materials
that
he
already
had
in
his
capacity
before
the
grand
jury,
and
the
district
court,
as
i
say,
allowed
the
disclosure
to
the
civil
division
and
also
did
not
find
any
disclosure
violation.
the
court
of
appeals
however
reversed
considering
that
the
continued
use
later
on
was
tantamount
to
the
disclosure
and
there
was
not
particularized
need.
we,
in
turn,
reverse
the
court
of
appeals
holding
that
the
showing
was
adequate
and
that
continued
use
does
not
come
within
the
language
of
the
rule
prohibiting
to
disclosure.
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissent
joined
by
justice
marshall
and
justice
blackmun.
justice
white
did
not
participate
in
the
consideration
or
decision
of
the
case.
