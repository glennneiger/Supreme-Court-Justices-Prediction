unknown
speaker
what
is
your
idea
of
what
6(e)
means?
unknown
speaker
would
the
court
order
be
routine?
unknown
speaker
there
would
be
a
hearing
on
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
i
find
the
phrase
"the
workings
of
the
grand
jury."
less
than
totally
clear
as
to
just
what
we're
talking
about.
you
know,
certainly
if
one
were
to
say
it
takes
23
people
to
be
a
grand
jury,
it
has
to
be
an
indictment
by
a
majority,
you
would
say
that's
the
workings
of
the
grand
jury.
yet
obviously
that
isn't
prohibited
from
disclosure.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
the
government
subpoenaed
a
whole
bunch
of
documents
from
a
particular
witness
before
the
grand
jury.
the
government
didn't
know
of
any
specific
document
in
this
group
before,
and
all
of
these
documents
were
examined
by
the
grand
jury.
now,
could
a
government
attorney
then
go
out
and
say,
well,
look,
contract
such-and-such
provided
such-and-such?
unknown
speaker
well,
tell
it
to
someone
to
whom
disclosure
is
not
authorized.
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
a
witness
is
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury
and
the
witness
says:
on
february
5th
i
met
with
joe
jones.
can
the
attorney
then
go
out,
the
government
attorney,
and
disclose
to
another
person
that
witness
x
said
on
february
5th
he
met
with
joe
jones?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
may
i
just
follow
up
with
the
chief
justice's
question.
supposing
they
were
drafting
a
civil
complaint
and
the
key
allegation
was
there
was
a
meeting
between
two
persons
agreeing
on
prices
at
a
specific
time,
date,
and
place;
and
that
the
only
evidence
the
government
had
of
that
was
a
written
document
that
had
been
subpoenaed
before
the
grand
jury.
could
they
file
such
a
complaint
without
a
6(e)
order?
unknown
speaker
even
though
at
least
some
people
within
the
government,
knowing
the
full
scope
of
the
government's
civil
investigation,
some
people
would
know
that
the
only
place
that
information
could
have
come
from
was
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
no,
that
was
no
question.
the
specific
person
who
drafted
the
complaint
had
no
other
source
of
information
except
the
grand
jury
transcript
or
grand
jury
document.
could
he
file
such
a
complaint?
you
say
yes.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just
follow
up.
supposing
in
the
pretrial
discovery
in
the
civil
case
the
defendant
asks
the
government
in
substance,
what
is
the
source
of...
what
is
the
evidence
supporting
that
allegation
or
something.
could
they
answer
that
interrogatory
without
a
court
order?
identify
the
witnesses
who
can
so
testify
or
the
documents
which
will
support
that
allegation?
unknown
speaker
just
identifies
the
name
of
the
person
who
happened
to
be
a
witness
and
the
government
had
never
talked
to
except
in
that--
unknown
speaker
--i
assume
that
the
civil
division
lawyer
or
the
criminal
division
lawyer
assigned
to
the
civil
division
who's
working
with
someone
else
in
that
division.
how
could
he
possibly
not
be
disclosing
to
the
person
that
he's
working
with
that
he
has
all
sorts
of
information
that
this
person
must
assume
came
from
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
he
says
witness
x
will
say
thus
and
such,
right.
so
his
colleague
says,
how
do
you
know
that?
he
says,
well,
you
shouldn't
ask.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
that
happened
in
this
case,
as
i
understand
it,
according
to
a
letter
to
the
clerk
of
this
court,
without
a
court
order.
unknown
speaker
do
you
defend
that
position
here
in
the
face
of
sells
engineering?
unknown
speaker
but
did
they
formally
respond
by
identifying
the
documents
in
response
to
the
cid?
at
least
two
of
them
i
think
did
not.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
that's
an
adequate
response
to
the
statutory
demand?
unknown
speaker
formally,
on
the
record?
unknown
speaker
does
the
record
disclose
there's
been
full
compliance
with
the
cid's,
in
other
words,
full
responses
to
them?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
unknown
speaker
what
i
have
in
mind--
unknown
speaker
--i
don't
remember
the
terms
of
the
statute
well
enough,
but
say
you
serve
an
interrogatory,
you're
entitled
to
a
sworn
answer
that
so
and
so
is
the
case.
when
you
serve
a
cid,
aren't
you
entitled
to
some
kind
of
a
sworn
response
that
there's
been
a
complete
delivery
of
everything
demanded?
and
do
you
accept
a
phone
call
from
a
lawyer
saying,
you've
got
it
all,
as
sufficient?
unknown
speaker
mr.
grand,
i
have
not
yet
seen
that
letter.
could
you
just
very
briefly
summarize
it?
unknown
speaker
what
materials
was
it
that
you
say
were
disclosed?
unknown
speaker
thank
you.
unknown
speaker
well
it
might
increase
the
risk,
but
certainly
studying
it
by
itself
does
not
amount
to
to
disclosure,
does
it?
unknown
speaker
well,
okay,
let's
stop.
in
drafting
a
complaint,
you
don't
ordinarily
set
out
with
great
specificity
facts
and
exhibits.
i
mean,
you
plead
generally.
i
don't
see
why
it
isn't
possible
to
draft
a
complaint
without
disclosing
grand
jury
materials
whatever
that
phrase
may
mean.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
the
complaint
alleges
that
some
time
during
the
year
1985
the
defendants
met
and
conspired
to
fix
prices,
and
actually
there
was
testimony
before
the
grand
jury
that
on
particular
dates
particular
defendants
met
at
a
particular
place.
the
complaint
doesn't
go
into
that
detail.
is
that
"disclosing"
what
went
on
before
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
what
does
that
phrase
mean?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
fact--
unknown
speaker
--the
fact
that
a
conspiracy
took
place
on
a
certain
date
is
not
a
matter
occurring
before
the
grand
jury.
the
matter
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
is
the
fact
that
someone
testified
that
the
conspiracy
took
place
on
a
certain
date.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
that's
correct
then
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice
was
wrong.
unknown
speaker
i
understand,
but
you're
going
to
answer
my
question?
i
still
don't
understand
how
it
is
a
matter
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
that
a
conspiracy
took
place
on
a
certain
date.
unknown
speaker
the
fact
that
that
was
brought
to
the
attention
of
the
grand
jury,
right?
unknown
speaker
so
you
can
use
those
facts
as
much
as
you
like,
so
long
as
you
don't
disclose
that
those
facts
were
presented
to
the
grand
jury,
isn't
that
correct?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
think
it
was
a
jump.
it's
a
jump.
it's
a
question
of
who's
making
the
jump.
unknown
speaker
the
only
reason
that
would
not
be
permissible
is
that,
given
that
manner
of
disclosure,
it
is
evident
that...
it
is
evident
that
what
is
being
disclosed
is
not
merely
the
fact
of
the
conspiracy,
but
that
the
grand
jury
was
told
about
the
fact
of
that
conspiracy.
it
is
in
essence
the
disclosure
of
the
fact
that
it
was
given
to
the
grand
jury
that's
the
nub
of
the
matter,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
your
trouble
is
he's
no
longer
"prosecutor"
in
the
civil
case.
what
you
are
saying
is
that
if
a
lawyer
is
in
the
grand
jury
qua
prosecutor
and
then
he
comes
out
as
a
lawyer
qua
civil
attorney,
he
must
forget
everything
that
happened
in
the
grand
jury.
isn't
that
what
you're
saying?
unknown
speaker
i
hope
not.
unknown
speaker
well,
how
can
he
forget
that
the
conspiracy
happened
on
such
a
date?
he
can't
ever
forget
that.
but
don't
you
want
him
to
forget
it?
unknown
speaker
that
the
conspiracy
occurred
in
may
of
'84?
unknown
speaker
well,
he
must
forget
that?
unknown
speaker
he
must
forget
that?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
you
can
get
behind
it.
unknown
speaker
you
are
in
trouble
with
another
point.
the
antitrust
lawyer
handles
civil
and
criminal
cases,
isn't
that
true?
unknown
speaker
that's
your
real
problem.
unknown
speaker
because
he
is
not...
as
an
antitrust
lawyer,
he
is
not
automatically
a
prosecutor.
unknown
speaker
mr.
grand,
can
i
interrupt
with,
maybe
it's
a
stupid
question.
i'm
sorry.
on
the
issue
of
what
is
a
matter,
disclosing
a
matter
occurring
before
the
grand
jury,
supposing
there
is
an
elaborate
investigation
and
all
of
the
evidence
supporting
the
conclusions
that
the
government
lawyers
draw
are
derived
from
the
grand
jury
proceeding,
and
they
return
an
indictment
which
spells
out
the
charges
in
detail.
is
the
indictment
a
disclosure
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute?
and
if
not,
why
is
a
civil
complaint
a
disclosure
if
they're
word
for
word
the
same?
they
used
to
return
them
at
the
same
time
frequently.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
they
return
the
two
pleadings
simultaneously,
they
file
an
indictment
and
a
civil
complaint
simultaneously,
are
both
permitted
disclosures
or
are
both...
or
is
it
true
that
neither
of
them
is
a
disclosure
within
the
meaning
of
the
rule?
or
do
you
say
one
is
a
disclosure
and
the
other
is
not?
they're
word
for
word
the
same
in
the
charging
paragraphs.
unknown
speaker
and
one
is
permitted
and
one
is
not.
unknown
speaker
i
suppose
under
your
view
of
the
situation
it
might
be
an
unauthorized
disclosure
if
the
government
attorneys
tried
to
duplicate
getting
the
information
in
the
civil
case,
because
they
would
have
to
rely
on
information
disclosed
before
the
grand
jury
to
show
who
to
subpoena
and
what
evidence
to
request.
would
your
argument
take
you
that
far?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
certainly
sounds
like
your
argument
would
lead
you
to
that
result.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
just
leads
to
the
inevitable
conclusion
that
the
justice
department
has
no
choice.
they
have
to
proceed
first
in
a
civil
case.
i
mean,
that's
the
sum
and
substance
of
where
it
would
lead.
unknown
speaker
well,
if
your
argument
is
right,
then
the
court
of
appeals
was
clearly
wrong
when
it
said
there
is
no
particularized
need
here
for
the
government,
because
they
can
go
out
and
duplicate
the
discovery
on
their
own,
because
under
your
view
they
couldn't.
so
if
you're
right
on
the
first
argument,
then
the
court
was
certainly
wrong
in
saying
there
was
no
particularized
need,
wasn't
it?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
you
can
have
it
both
ways.
unknown
speaker
it
would
not
make
any
difference
to
your
analysis,
mr.
grand,
i
take
it,
that
the
prosecutor
may
have
known
completely
about
what
a
witness
was
to
testify
to
and
having
gone
over
the
testimony
word
for
word
before
the
witness
ever
testified
before
the
grand
jury?
unknown
speaker
so
what
you're
really--
unknown
speaker
--what
you're
really
arguing
for
is
not
just
non-disclosure.
you're
arguing
for
immunity.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
see
how.
unknown
speaker
i
don't
see
how
you
can
escape
that
if
the
prosecutor
knew
about
it
without
recourse
to
the
grand
jury
and
before
the
grand
jury
ever
sat.
unknown
speaker
you
agree
then
that
if
the
prosecutor
knew
of
a
particular
piece
of
testimony
or
of
a
document
without
recourse
to
grand
jury
subpoena,
then
it
would
not
be
disclosure
for
him
to
talk
about
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
grand,
about
your
proposition
that
it
doesn't
really
inhibit
the
government
very
much
to
have
to
conduct
a
separate
civil
proceeding.
you
say
the
sec,
for
example,
is
not
inhibited
by
the
fact
that
it
has
no
criminal
authority,
it
just
proceeds
separately.
isn't
it
the
case...
it
used
to
be
and
i
assume
it
still
is...
that
once
a
criminal
investigation
is
afoot,
a
civil
investigation
by
the
sec
or
by
anybody
else
stops
unto
the
criminal
investigation
is
completed?
doesn't
it?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
still
the
case?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
what
about
disclosure
to
secretaries
and
such?
is
that
at
issue
here?
unknown
speaker
i'm
sorry,
i
know
you
want
to
go
on.
but
let
me
press
on.
3(a)(1)
says
3(a)(2)
says
"such
government
personnel
as
are
deemed
necessary
to
assist
an
attorney
for
the
government
in
the
performance."
the
rule
seems
to
envision
attorneys
being
different
from
those
who
are
necessary
to
assist
the
attorney.
so
permitted
disclosure
to
an
attorney
would
seem
not
automatically
to
embrace
disclosure
by
the
attorney
to
a
secretary.
