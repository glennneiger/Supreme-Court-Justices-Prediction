mr.
paul
r.
grand
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
government
has
today
argued
to
the
court,
as
they
did
in
their
reply
brief,
an
issue
which
is
not
presented
in
this
case.
the
question
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari
is
not
whether
a
prosecutor
may
simply
sit
in
his
office
and
review
grand
jury
materials
in
the
abstract.
at
issue
before
this
court
is
whether
the
prosecutor
who
conducted
the
grand
jury
investigation
may
use
the
grand
jury's
secret
materials
to
prepare
and
litigate
a
civil
case
without
first
obtaining
a
rule
6(e)
order.
every
time
the
civil
use
of
grand
jury
materials
has
come
before
this
court,
from
procter
&
gamble
through
douglas
oil,
baggett,
and
sells,
this
court
has
limited
disclosure
in
order
to
preserve
grand
jury
secrecy.
it
has
done
so
because
the
grand
jury's
purposes
and
functions
can
only
be
carried
out
if
the
grand
jury
is
protected
by
secrecy.
there
are
affirmative
mischiefs,
three
particular
affirmative
mischiefs,
that
this
court
noted
in
united
states
versus
sells,
which
mischiefs
have
been
previously
noted
in
prior
cases,
all
of
which
will
come
to
pass
in
this
case,
some
of
which
have
already
come
to
pass.
for
example,
unauthorized
disclosure
of
grand
jury
material
we
say
will
necessarily
occur
if
a
prosecutor
is
permitted
to
use
the
grand
jury's
materials
wholesale
to
bring
a
civil
case.
in
fact,
as
we
learned
last
friday
with
the
letter
from
the
solicitor
general
to
your
honors,
such
disclosures
have
already
taken
place.
well
after
the
conclusion
of
the
grand
jury
investigation,
grand
jury
materials
were
improperly
disclosed
to
attorneys
in
the
justice
department
who
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
criminal
investigation.
this
kind
of
improper
disclosure,
we
submit,
is
inevitable
if
the
determinative
question
is
going
to
be
who
you
are,
rather
than
the
use
you
are
making
of
the
materials.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
can't,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
can't
answer
that.
this
is
a
letter
from
the
solicitor
general
to
your
honors
in
which
it
acknowledges
that
after
the
termination
of
the
criminal
phase
of
this
case
there
were
unauthorized
disclosures
within
the
department
of
justice
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury.
i
do
not
know
what
those
were.
they
are
concededly
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
and
if
you
don't
have
a
copy,
your
honor,
i'll
be
happy
to
hand
you.
indeed,
it
was
the
risk
of
just
this
kind
of
improper
disclosure
that
led
the
second
circuit
when
it
ruled
in
this
case
to
rule
that
grand
jury
materials
should
not
be
automatically
available
to
a
prosecutor
for
use
in
civil
litigation.
the
second
circuit
noted
that
there
were
additional
risks,
risks
to
disclosure
to
paralegals
and
to
secretaries,
to
new
co-counsel
who
may
come
onto
the
case
to
assist
the
prosecutor
in
the
civil
phase.
and
finally,
it
seems
to
me
no
one
could
seriously
argue
that
the
prosecutor's
study
of
each
witness'
grand
jury
testimony
the
night
before
the
prosecutor
intends
to
take
the
civil
deposition
of
that
witness
will
not
increase
the
risk
of
improper
disclosures
during
the
questioning
of
those
witnesses.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
agree
with
your
honor
that
the
mere
abstract
study
in
the
office
does
not
increase
the
risk
of
disclosure.
but
that
is
not
the
issue
in
this
case.
those
are
not
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
this
case,
from
the
district
court
through
the
second
circuit
to
here
the
government
has
readily
conceded
that
it
has
used
grand
jury
materials
so
far
to
frame
and
draft
each
paragraph
of
the
complaint.
they
will
have
to
use
those
same
grand
jury
materials
in
order
to
respond
to
interrogatories
that
we
will
ask.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
think,
your
honor,
you've
just
hit
on
the
key
point.
yes,
it
is
certainly
possible
to
draft
a
complaint
without
quoting
from
grand
jury
transcripts
and
it
is
possible
to
draft
a
civil
complaint
without
naming
the
grand
jury
as
its
source.
but
i
don't
think
anyone
would
argue
with
the
proposition
that
a
complaint
that
follows
a
grand
jury
investigation
such
as
this
one
is
a
summary
of
the
substance
of
what
took
place
in
that
grand
jury.
now,
if
the
disclosure
of
a
summary
of
the
grand
jury's
investigation
is
not
a
disclosure
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury,
then
what
we
have
succeeded
in
doing
is
totally
redefining
what
is
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
think
it
is
unquestionably
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
let
me
address
that.
if
you
look
at
the
rule
itself,
the
rule
itself
uses
that
phrase.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
it
forbids
disclosure
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury.
if
the
phrase
meant
only
that
it
is
impermissible
to
disclose
transcripts
or
to
disclose
"material",
first
of
all,
the
rule
could
have
said
as
much;
and
secondly,
there
would
have
been
no
reason
for
a
prohibition
or
to
impose
secrecy
on
interpreters
or
grand
jurors,
because
they
don't
have
transcripts
anyway.
secondly,
if
what
the
rule
was
only
intended
to
guard
against
was
the
disclosure
that
the
grand
jury
was
the
source,
the
rule
could
have
said
that.
but
instead,
the
rule
as
drafted
by
congress
i
believe
was
drafted
in
as
broad
a
frame
as
possible:
"matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury."
and
the
reason
for
that
was
to
incorporate
the
whole
substance
of
what
goes
on
before
the
grand
jury--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--for
the
simple
reason
of
protecting
the
function
of
the
grand
jury.
i'm
sorry.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
that
is
correct.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
don't
think
so.
the
only
source
of
that
information
in
the
hands
of
the
government
is
the
grand
jury.
there
could
be
other
sources
of
that
information
to
the
government.
the
government
had
other
sources
available
to
it
here,
for
example
the
acpa.
but...
and
so
that
the
record
should
be
clear
in
this
court,
there
has
been
no
attempt
on
the
part
of
my
clients
in
any
way
to
suppress
the
facts.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
what
is
a
matter
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
is
the
fact
of
the
investigation
of
that,
the
determination
that
that
took
place.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
yes.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
think
it's
that
last
jump--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--well,
if
it
is
not
disclosing
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury
to
paint
with
a
broad
brush,
to
summarize
the
facts
learned
by
the
grand
jury,
then
it
will
be
equally
permissible
for
the
government
midway
through
a
grand
jury
investigation
to
issue
a
press
release
that
simply
says
there
was
a
conspiracy
going
on,
to
use
your
words,
justice
scalia.
or
it
would
be
permissible
for
a
grand
juror
to
lean
over
the
fence
and
tell
his
neighbor,
look
what
i
know.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
suggest
to
your
honor
that
when
the
prosecutor
is
the
person
who
is
disclosing
the
matter
in
a
civil
complaint,
you
have
exactly
the
same
inference
that
flows,
particularly
when
all
of
the
witnesses
and
all
of
those
subpoenaed
to
produce
documents
know
that
they've
only
been
subpoenaed
by
the
people
who
were
running
the
grand
jury.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
think
that
the
question...
i
think
that,
first
let
me
say
that
the
question
of
disqualification
i
don't
think
is
before
the
court
in
this
matter.
however,
it
seems
to
me--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--if
i
may,
i
believe,
your
honor,
that
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
prosecutor
in
a
particular
case
should
be
disqualified
will
be
a
function
of
how
much
that
prosecutor
learned
in
the
grand
jury,
what
his
participation
was,
the
relatedness
of
the
civil
case
to
the
criminal
case,
the
remoteness
in
time,
all
of
which
are
questions
more
properly
addressed
to
a
district
court,
but
none
of
which
exist
in
this
case,
where
the
issue
presented
is
can
the
prosecutor
use,
not
simply
remember
in
his
head,
but
can
the
prosecutor
use
grand
jury
materials,
testimony
from
several
dozens
of
witnesses,
i
think
is
the
phrase,
and
documents
to
prepare
and
litigate
this
case.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
believe
he
cannot
use
the
fact
that
the
conspiracy
occurred--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--in
may
of
'84--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--i
mean,
if
you're
asking
me
am
i
arguing
about
whether
he
can
use
his
own
memory,
i'm
not
arguing
that.
i
will
be
happy
to
if
you'd
like
me
to.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
in
this
case,
this
case
that's
before
the
court,
i
don't
think
the
question
of
the
prosecutor's
memory
has
arisen.
however,
however,
if
this
case
is
to
go
forward,
if
the
two
prosecutors
are
still
in
the
antitrust
division,
if
those
two
prosecutors
are
assigned
to
this
case,
then
in
light
of
the
concessions
that
have
been
made
in
this
and
in
the
lower
courts
that
grand
jury
materials
were
used
by
them,
then
i
think
they
would
have
to
be
disqualified.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
that
is
true.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
well,
your
honor--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--the
matter,
this
case,
was
referred
by
the
aid
agency
to
the
antitrust
division
in
1981.
a
choice
was
made
then
to
present
the
matter
to
the
grand
jury,
even
though
subject
matter
jurisdiction
over
the
whole
question
of
the
sale
of
this
commodity
that
is
sold
nowhere
in
the
united
states
was
raised
at
the
outset.
the
acpa,
the
antitrust
civil
process
act,
was
just
as
available
in
1981,
indeed
passed
after
procter
&
gamble.
the
acpa
was
passed,
and
the
legislative
history
of
that
statute
suggests
it
is
to
be
used
in
cases
where
it
is
not
clear
that
a
criminal
violation
has
taken
place.
so
i
agree
with
you
that
the
antitrust
division
has
this
dual
function,
but
they
have
more
than
one
set
of
tools
with
which
to
perform
that
function.
and
what
we
are
suggesting
is
that
when
they
are
using...
when
they're
preparing
a
civil
case,
then
they
have
to
rely
on
civil
materials.
when
they're
preparing
a
criminal
case,
they
have
to
rely
on--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--i
believe
that
there's
no
question
that
an
indictment
surely
is
a
disclosure
of
matters
occurring
before
the
grand
jury.
however,
that
is
a
permitted
disclosure
because
it
is
part
of
the
attorney
for
the
government's
performance
of
his
duties
to
enforce
the
criminal
law
and
therefore
it
is
a
permitted
use
and
disclosure.
i
think
your
question
raises
another
interesting
point,
your
honor,
and
that
is
this.
this
case
is
unusual
in
the
sense
that
there
was
a
grand
jury
investigation
that
resulted
in
no
indictment.
most
cases
that
are
investigated
by
the
grand
jury
result
in
indictments.
when
there
is
an
indictment,
then
the
indictment
exists
from
which
a
civil
complaint
can
be
framed.
if
there
is
a
trial
thereafter,
the
trial
material
exists
and
grand
jury
secrecy
does
not
have
to
be--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--to
me
they
would
both
be
disclosures,
there's
no
question
about
it.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
one
is
permitted
and
one
is
not.
now,
one
can
avoid
that
dilemma
by
having
the
complaint
drafted
from
the
indictment
after
the
indictment
is
published.
but
it
is
clear
that
the
disclosure
of
the
indictment
is
a
permitted
disclosure
because
it
is
in
furtherance
of
the
attorney's
fulfillment
of
his
duties
to
enforce
the
criminal
law.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
we
have
not...
we
do
not
feel
that
the
issues
in
this
case
require
us
to
go
that
far.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
certainly
other
attorneys
could
do
that,
and
in
this
case,
as
long
ago
as
1981,
the
justice
department
could
have
made
the
choice
based
on
the
reference
from
the
aid
agency,
to
look
into
the
matter
on
a
civil
basis.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor,
for
the
following
reasons.
as
i
was
saying
to
justice
stevens,
this
situation
that
we
have
before
the
court
today
arises
relatively
rarely.
it
arises
only
in
the
case
where
there
has
not
been
an
indictment.
in
that
situation,
the
government
cannot
in
our
view
use
grand
jury
materials
to
bring
a
civil
case.
but
it
is
only
in
that
situation.
now,
there
are
many
instances
where
the
government
of
the
united
states
functions
very
effectively...
indeed,
one
might
say
that
the
securities
and
exchange
commission
with
its
parallel
system
of
investigations
is
having
a
very
good
year.
they
are
not
inhibited
by
the
fact
that
they
are
unable
to
use
grand
jury
materials
to
conduct
their
own
civil
investigations.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
well,
there
was
no
attempt
in
november
of
1984,
when
the
government
sought
a
6(e)
order
ex
parte,
there
was
no
attempt
by
the
government
to
make
any
showing
of
particularized
need
to
reveal
grand
jury
materials.
instead,
what
they
went
into
the
district
court
and
said
is
they
wanted
to
disclose
all
of
the
grand
jury
materials
in
order
to
seek
the
advice
of
the
civil
division.
for
that,
the
second
circuit
said
they
had
not
shown
particularized
need.
and
under
the
decisions
of
this
court,
they
clearly
had
not.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
not
in
this
case,
in
light
of
the
way
the
issues
have
been
framed
and
the
concessions
made.
i
might,
your
honor,
point
to--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--excuse
me.
in
baggett,
which--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--no,
i'm
not.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
most
respectfully,
i'm
not.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
then
i
agree
with
you.
i
thought
you
were
addressing
a
different
point.
you
see,
in
baggett
one
of
the
issues
in
the
baggett
case
was
whether
or
not
an
interview
conducted
by
a
prosecutor
pursuant
to
a
grand
jury
subpoena
was
grand
jury
materials.
and
the
seventh
circuit
held
it
was
and
those
are
part
of
the
materials
for
which
there
was
a
failure
to
show
that--
mr.
paul
r.
grand
--my
understanding
is
that
that
accurately
states
the
broad
status
of
the
law
on
that
subject.
if
the
prosecutor
comes
by
information
independent
of
the
grand
jury,
it's
not
covered
by
grand
jury
secrecy.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
i'm
smiling
only
because
i
wish
it
was
still
the
case.
mr.
paul
r.
grand
it's
not
still
the
case,
and
we
have
a
number
of
clients
who
are
suffering
because
of
it.
the
sec
goes
right
on
doing
its
investigation
without
any
regard
to
what's
happening
in
the
grand
jury.
i
might
also
point
out
something
else,
your
honor,
and
that
is
in
december
the
acpa,
the
antitrust
civil
process
act,
was
amended
in
order
to
make
it
available
for
investigation
of
false
claims.
rule
6(e)
on
its
face
is
a
general
rule
of
secrecy.
the
exceptions
are
for
limited
and
specific
purposes.
grand
jury
materials
have
never
been
freely
available
for
civil
litigation
because
secrecy
is
so
essential
to
the
functioning
of
the
grand
jury.
the
rule
does
not
single
out
attorneys
for
the
government
for
any
special
mention
except
in
connection
with
their
duty
to
assist
the
grand
jury
in
enforcing
the
criminal
law.
when
the
phrase
"attorney
for
the
government"
appears
in
the
rule,
it
is
either
in
connection
with
that
specific
duty
or
the
attorneys
for
the
government
are
treated
exactly
the
same
as
stenographers,
interpreters,
and
the
grand
jurors
themselves.
the
rule
binds
all
present
to
secrecy.
it
has
no
provision
for
general
civil
use.
as
this
court
held
in
united
states
against
sells
engineering,
congress
intended
(a)(1)
to
have
the
same
limitations
on
use
that
are
explicit
in
(a)(2),
and
(a)(2)
specifically
prohibits
government
personnel
from
using
grand
jury
material
in
civil
litigation.
but
since
a
prosecutor
will
need
assistance
in
the
civil
phase
of
a
complex
case,
the
government
now
finds
it
necessary
to
totally
rewrite
the
language
of
(a)(1).
as
a
consequence,
the
government
is
now
arguing
in
this
court
that
an
attorney
for
the
government
in
(a)(1)
means
not
only
attorneys
who
participated
in
the
criminal
investigation,
but
also
secretaries
and
also
paralegals,
whether
or
not
those
people
had
been
hired
or
assigned
or
had
anything
to
do
with
the
criminal
investigation.
i
respectfully
submit
that
if
congress
had
intended
secretaries
and
paralegals
to
be
included
in
(a)(1),
it
would
have
been
easy
enough
to
draft
them
into
the
provision.
to
me,
the
danger
of
what
is
threatened
here
is
a
kind
of
dual
danger.
the
government
is
arguing
that
review
is
not
use,
and
then
they
are
also
arguing
that
so
long
as
they
disclose
only
a
summary,
without
quotation
marks
and
without
naming
the
grand
jury
as
the
source,
they
have
made
no
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials.
if
that
were
the
case,
then
the
grand
jury...
the
government
alone
would
be
able
to
determine
what
constitutes
disclosure
of
grand
jury
materials
and
we
will
have
established
a
very
dangerous
precedent,
which
i
fear
will
effectively
end
grand
jury
secrecy
and
the
effective
functioning
of
the
grand
jury.
i
want
to
close
on
one
note,
and
that
is
that
if
this
court
permits
prosecutors
to
use
grand
jury
materials
to
litigate
civil
cases
without
a
court
order,
then
the
government
will
overrule
this
court's
decision
in
sells
merely
by
the
way
it
assigns
its
attorneys.
thank
you.
