chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-1940,
united
states
versus
cherokee
nation
of
oklahoma.
mr.
minear,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
wilcoxen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
may
be
true,
mr.
wilcoxen,
but
your
opponent
suggests
that
our
cases
are
virtually
larded
with
statements
that
the
exercise
of
the
navigational
servitude
is
not
a
taking
of
property
even
from
people
because
they
had
no
compensable
interest.
it
was
always
subject
to
this
servitude.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
should
it
be
different
in
this
one
case
of
a
patent
to
the
cherokee
nation
as
opposed
to
all
of
the
streambeds
that
have
gone
to
the
states
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
countless
streambeds
have
gone
to
the
states
of
the
union
upon
their
admission
on
the
basis
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
so
that
there
are
numerous
states
that
are
situated
similarly
to
the
cherokee
tribe
here.
why
should
the
cherokee
tribe
be
unique
as
opposed
to
the
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
suggesting
it
did,
but
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
our
cases
have
held,
give
the
states
fee
title
to
land
underlying
riverbeds
certainly
every
bit
as
much
as
the
cherokee
got.
so
why
shouldn't
they
be
treated
the
same
for
purposes
of
the
navigational
servitude?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
not
talking
about
a
riparian
owner.
a
riparian
owner
is
a
person
who
owns
land
along
the
bed
of
the
banks
of
a
stream.
i
am
talking
about
states
which
own
the
bed
of
a
stream,
just
as
the
cherokees
do
here.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
is
one
thing,
though,
for
the
cherokee
nation
to
be
able
to
exclude
traders
and
people
like
that.
it
is
another
thing
to
be
able
to
exclude
the
united
states.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
is
true
in
any
number
of
the
other
navigational
servitude
cases.
you
know,
valuable
rights
were
taken
in
chandler,
dunbar
and
willow
river,
in
lewis
bluepoint
oyster,
and
it
was
held
they
weren't
compensable.
there
was
no
question
that
the
damages
were
substantial
if
they
could
have
been
allowed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
everybody
takes
with
the
expectation
that
the
government
will
exercise
its
navigational
servitude.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
our
cases
have
said
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
logic
coming
the
other
way
is
that
if
the
cherokee
nation
is
subject
to
eminent
domain,
it
is
subject
to
the
navigational
servitude.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it
isn't
unique
at
all.
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
by
the
very
act
of
admitting
states
to
the
union,
they
get
precisely
the
fee
simple
title
to
the
bed
of
a
river
that
you
are
talking
about.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
is
it
intended
there
and
not
in
this
case?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
i
dare
say
everyone
who
gets
a
patent
from
the
united
states
thinks
and
does
get
fee
simple,
if
that
is
what
the
patent
says,
with
all
the
bundle
of
rights
that
includes
and
yet
every
other
patent
is
subject
to
the
navigational
servitude,
and
you
are
insisting
that
this
somehow
stands
by
itself.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
expelling
or
keeping
the
settlers
out
the
tribe
had
the
support
of
the
united
states,
did
it
not?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
now,
here
the
united
states
is
on
the
other
side,
and
so
the
question
is,
how
much
of
that
muscle
was
the
tribe's
and
how
much
of
it
was
the
united
states'.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
united
states
had
wanted
to
march
a
troop
of
cavalry
through
the
reservation.
do
you
think
the
cherokee
tribe
could
have
kept
them
out?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
am
sure
it
would
be.
i
think
the
former
question
and
not
the
latter
is
the
one
that
is
relevant
to
your
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wilcoxen.
mr.
minear,
do
you
have
something
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
minear.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
opinion
of
the
court
to
announce
the
no.
85-1940,
united
states
against
cherokee
nation,
a
case
that
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
in
1970,
this
court
found
the
treaties
between
the
united
states
and
certain
indian
tribes
including
the
respondent
here,
granted
to
the
tribes,
fee
simple
interest
in
portions
of
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river.
these
interests
were
damaged
by
navigational
improvement
made
by
the
united
states
to
the
arkansas
river
as
a
part
of
the
mcclellan-kerr
project
and
the
tribe
sought
compensation
for
this
damage
under
the
fifth
amendment.
the
united
states
claimed
that
it
acted
pursuant
to
its
navigational
servitude
in
making
improvements
to
the
arkansas
river
but
the
court
of
appeals
decided
that
the
government
must
compensate
that
tribe
for
the
damage.
in
a
unanimous
opinion
filed
with
the
clerk
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
our
cases
established
that
the
exercise
of
the
navigational
servitude
is
not
an
invasion
of
private
property
rights
but
rather
an
exercise
of
a
power
to
which
river
bed
interests
have
always
been
subject
and
accordingly
no
compensation
is
due.
