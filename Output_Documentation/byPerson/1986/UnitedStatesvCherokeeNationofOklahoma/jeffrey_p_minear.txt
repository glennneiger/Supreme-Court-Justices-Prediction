mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
1970,
this
court
decided
the
case
of
choctaw
nation
versus
oklahoma.
that
decision
effectively
held
that
the
cherokee
nation
owns
an
87-mile
portion
of
the
bed
of
the
arkansas
river.
the
cherokee
nation
has
since
sued
the
united
states,
claiming
that
the
federal
government's
navigational
improvements
on
the
arkansas
river
have
damaged
the
tribe's
riverbed
properties.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
tribe's
claims
are
barred
by
the
united
states
navigational
servitude
which
permits
the
government
to
improve
navigable
waters
free
from
demands
for
just
compensation.
the
government's
brief
describes
the
long
history
of
federal
navigation
improvements
on
the
arkansas
river
and
the
genesis
of
the
present
dispute.
turning
directly
to
the
legal
question
at
issue,
i
will
first
address
the
characteristics
of
the
navigational
servitude
and
then
explain
why
the
servitude
is
fully
applicable
in
this
case.
it
has
been
well
settled
since
this
court's
historic
decision
in
gibbons
v.
ogden
that
the
commerce
clause
gives
congress
broad
power
to
regulate
and
improve
navigable
water
for
the
public
benefit.
this
court,
construing
that
authority
in
light
of
history
and
the
needs
of
interstate
commerce,
has
developed
the
concept
of
the
navigational
servitude.
this
concept
has
played
a
vital
role
in
the
commercial
unification
of
the
country.
the
navigational
servitude
expresses
a
general
understanding
that
the
determination
whether
federal
navigation
improvements
have
taken
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
must
take
into
account
the
overarching
public
interest
in
free
navigation.
it
recognizes
the
historic
fact
that
navigable
waters
are
especially
valuable
as
a
conduit
for
trade,
and
that
for
this
purpose
they
should
be
treated
as
public
property
of
the
nation,
to
be
used
for
the
common
benefit
of
all
of
the
nation's
constituents,
and
of
particular
relevance
in
the
present
case,
the
navigational
servitude
lays
down
a
firm
rule
that
the
united
states
is
not
required
to
pay
compensation
for
damage
to
in-stream
property
resulting
from
federal
navigation
improvements
to
naturally
navigable
rivers.
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
the
owner
of
land
beneath
navigable
waters
has
a
qualified
title,
not
at
its
absolute
disposal,
but
to
be
held
at
all
times
subordinate
to
such
use
as
may
be
consistent
with
or
demanded
by
the
public
right
of
navigation.
this
court
has
recognized
that
principle
in
a
number
of
cases,
but
perhaps
the
best
example
is
lewis
bluepoint
oyster
company
versus
briggs.
in
lewis
the
plaintiff
cultivated
oysters
on
land
beneath
new
york's
great
south
bay
that
was
originally
conveyed
into
private
hands
through
a
royal
patent
during
the
colonial
period.
the
united
states
dredged
the
bay
to
improve
navigation,
destroying
the
plaintiff's
oyster
beds.
this
court
rejected
the
plaintiff's
demand
for
compensation
stating
that
by
necessary
implication
from
the
dominant
right
of
navigation,
title
to
submerged
land
is
acquired
and
held
subject
to
the
power
of
congress
to
deepen
the
water
over
such
lands
or
to
use
them
for
any
structure
which
the
interest
of
navigation
may
require.
as
lewis
indicates,
it
has
long
been
settled
that
the
united
states
is
not
constitutionally
obligated
to
pay
compensation
when
federal
navigation
improvements
impair
property
within
the
bed
of
a
naturally
navigable
body
of
water.
the
same
principle
is
applicable
here.
indeed,
when
this
court
confirmed
the
cherokee
nation's
riverbed
rights
in
the
choctaw
nation
decision,
it
specifically
recognized
the
tribe
was
subject
to
the
united
states
navigational
servitude.
the
cherokee
nation
nevertheless
contends
that
it
should
be
exempt
from
the
servitude,
but
there
is
no
basis
for
creating
such
an
exemption.
the
tribe
is
a
part
of
the
united
states
and
is
subject
just
like
any
of
the
nation's
other
constituents
to
the
national
government's
commerce
clause
powers.
the
cherokee
nation
argued
in
the
district
court
that
the
tribe's
quasi-sovereign
status
provides
a
basis
for
an
exemption.
we
disagree.
even
the
states
which
exercise
the
full
measure
of
sovereignty
allowable
under
the
constitution
are
subject
to
the
servitude.
indian
tribes,
which
have
only
limited
sovereignty
but
the
sufferance
of
congress,
are
not
entitled
to
broader
rights
than
the
states
possess.
the
cherokee
national
also
claims
an
exemption
on
the
ground
that
it
received
its
title
through
a
treaty
with
and
patent
from
the
united
states.
however,
that
fact
does
not
provide
the
basis
for
an
exemption.
the
tribe,
like
any
owner
of
land
beneath
navigable
waters,
took
its
riverbed
interest
subject
to
the
federal
government's
dominant
power
under
the
commerce
clause
to
regulate
and
promote
navigation.
the
united
states
did
not
waive
its
navigational
servitude
in
the
treaty
or
patent,
nor
was
it
obligated
to
make
an
express
reservation
of
that
sovereign
power.
the
retention
of
sovereign
authority
is
implicit
in
all
government
agreements
unless
surrendered
in
unmistakable
terms.
indeed,
as
the
lewis
case
demonstrates,
even
persons
who
hold
property
rights
that
predate
the
union
are
subject
to
the
servitude.
the
tribe
suggests
that
it
should
be
exempt
from
the
servitude
because
it
received
fee
simple
title
to
the
riverbed.
however,
the
court's
confirmation
of
the
tribe's
title
in
choctaw
nation
was
premised
in
part
on
the
fact
that
the
united
states
implicitly
retained
a
navigational
servitude,
and
in
any
event
this
court
has
specifically
rejected
the
contention
that
fee
interests
are
exempt
from
the
government's
long-standing
power
over
navigable
waters.
the
tribe
also
claims
an
exemption
from
the
servitude
based
on
the
united
states
trust
obligations
to
the
tribe.
the
tribe's
right
to
compensation,
however,
depends
on
whether
it
has
a
compensable
property
right
in
the
bed
of
a
naturally
navigable
body
of
water.
it
is
well
settled
under
this
court's
precedents
that
no
such
rights
can
exist
here.
as
this
court
has
stated,
the
application
of
the
navigational
servitude
is
not
an
invasion
of
any
private
property
rights
in
the
streams
or
the
lands
underlying
it
for
the
damage
sustained
does
not
result
from
the
taking
of
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
fifth
amendment
but
from
the
lawful
exercise
of
a
power
to
which
the
interests
of
the
property
owners
have
always
been
subject.
the
united
states
trust
responsibility
may
in
some
circumstances
create
an
obligation
to
administer
whatever
property
rights
that
tribe
might
possess
but
it
cannot
create
a
property
right
where
none
would
otherwise
exist.
at
bottom
we
are
dealing
here
with
a
doctrine
that
is
clear
and
well
settled.
the
united
states
owes
no
compensation
to
any
party
when
the
government's
navigational
improvements
impair
the
private
use
of
lands
within
the
bed
of
a
naturally
navigable
river.
that
doctrine
imposes
a
common
burden
on
all
of
the
nation's
constituents
for
the
common
good.
it
cannot
admit
a
special
exception
for
the
cherokee
tribe.
there
is
no
plausible
ground
for
exempting
the
tribe
uniquely
among
all
of
the
elements
that
comprise
a
national
union
from
an
otherwise
uniform
and
unifying
national
rule.
there
are
many
good
reasons
why
the
tribes'
request
for
an
exemption
should
be
denied.
the
tribe's
demand
for
compensation,
if
allowed,
could
amount
to
a
multi-million
dollar
toll
on
commerce
along
the
arkansas
river,
providing
a
windfall
to
the
tribe
at
the
public
expense.
furthermore,
the
recognition
of
an
exception
here
would
be
truly
remarkable
because
the
cherokee
nations
have
been
among
the
historic
beneficiaries
of
navigation
improvements
on
the
arkansas
river.
perhaps
most
troubling,
the
creation
of
an
exception
in
this
case
may
encourage
other
parties
to
sue
the
government,
demanding
compensation
for
in-stream
damages
that
were
previously
considered
noncompensable.
this
court
should
be
reluctant
to
disturb
a
long-settled
constitutional
doctrine
that
has
engendered
a
century
of
investment-backed
reliance.
that
is
particularly
true
here
where
congress
itself
has
examined
the
tribe's
claim
and
declined
to
provide
special
compensation.
for
all
of
these
reasons
we
suggest
that
the
decision
below
should
be
reversed.
thank
you,
your
honors.
mr.
jeffrey
p.
minear
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
believe
this
case
can
be
reduced
to
one
essential
question,
and
that
is
whether
the
tribe
is
a
part
of
the
national
union.
we
submit
that
it
is,
and
that
the
decision
below
should
therefore
be
reversed.
thank
you,
your
honor.
