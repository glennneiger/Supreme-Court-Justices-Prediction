mr.
james
wilcoxen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
when
the
united
states
argues
that
the
navigational
servitude
and
its
general
rule
of
no
compensation
prevents
the
cherokee
nation
from
having
a
compensable
interest
in
the
arkansas
riverbed
it
is
limited
to
previous
cases
which
have
no
relation
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
in
this
present
unique
case.
when
the
treaties
and
patent
granting
the
cherokee
nation
fee
simple
title
to
over
14
million
acres
of
land
in
what
is
now
the
state
of
oklahoma,
i
believe
that
congress
intended
to
give
the
cherokees
everything
it
had
to
give.
there
is
no
limitation
in
words
granting
fee
simple
title
to
a
permanent
home
forever
that
shall
in
no
future
time
without
their
consent
be
included
within
the
territorial
limits
or
jurisdiction
of
any
state
or
territory.
of
course,
this
is
not
to
say
that
the
cherokees
were
no
longer
subject
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states
but
it
is
to
say
that
whatever
rights
were
created
must
be
determined
from
the
unique
historical
circumstances
of
this
case
and
no
other.
more
precisely,
while
the
cherokee
nation
is
subject
to
the
broad
commerce
clause
power
to
regulate
navigation,
the
question
of
whether
the
exercise
of
that
power
affects
a
taking
of
property
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment
is
another
matters.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
the
cases
relied
upon
by
the
united
states
are
cases
where
riparian
owners
have
acquired
whatever
rights
that
the
states
got
and
it
was
intended
in
those
situations
and
always
was
intended
that
those
grants
be
subject
to
the
public
right
of
passage.
i
think
that
congress's
intent
in
this
case
was
when
it
gave
a
direct
patent
to
the
cherokee
nation
was
that
this
be
the
private
domain
of
the
cherokee
nation
and
that
there
was
no
public
right
of
passage--
mr.
james
wilcoxen
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor?
mr.
james
wilcoxen
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
the
equal
footing
doctrine
would
not
apply
as
a
limitation
to
the
cherokee
nation.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
because
i
think
it
was
clearly
intended
as
this
country
grew
westward
that
those
navigable
lands
be
and
remain
public
highways,
and
i
think
that
the
intent
in
the
grant,
the
patent
to
the
cherokee
nation
was
that
it
be
a
private
domain
for
the
cherokee
people
and
was
not
intended
to
be
a
technical
title.
the
cases
mention
a
bare
technical
title
that
a
riparian
owner
might
acquire
from
the
state.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
well,
that
is
a
good
question,
your
honor.
my
answer
would
be
that
i
believe
that
congress
intended
in
this
particular
case
when
it
uniquely
granted
fee
simple
title
to
the
bed
and
banks
of
the
navigable
waterway
that
it
be
and
remain
a
public...
i
mean,
i
am
sorry,
a
private
domain
for
the
cherokee
nation,
and
that
when,
to
further
answer
your
question,
and
that
when
oklahoma
statehood
took
place
that
property
passed
into
trust
with
the
specific
provision
that
the
lands
would
not
become
public
lands
nor
property
of
the
united
states,
but
would
be
held
in
trust
for
the
use
and
benefits
of
the
indians.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
well,
justice
o'connor,
i
don't
see
how--
mr.
james
wilcoxen
--to
me
i
don't
see
how
the
united
states
can
maintain
its
trust
responsibility
to
the
tribe
especially
in
the
face
of
an
express
provision
of
trust
and
take
and
use
this
property
for
a
very
public
purpose,
and
that
is
to
build
a
navigation
way
in
the
face
of
the
plain
provisions
of
the
act
of
1906.
congress
intended
to
move
the
cherokees
so
far
west
as
to
eliminate
the
conflict
between
white
settlers
and
the
tribe.
the
tribe,
reluctant
to
move,
demanded
fee
title.
it
was
the
first
and
one
of
few
to
get
it.
in
1838,
the
cherokees'
absolute
ownership
rights
to
the
entire
tract,
including
the
riverbed,
vested.
as
the
court
of
appeals
recognized,
vested
property
rights
secured
by
a
treaty
are
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment.
the
plain
purposes
of
the
treaties
and
patent
was
to
remove
and
exclude
the
cherokees
from
the
ruinous
effects
of
the
intruding
public.
they
were
specifically
promised
protection
against
interruption
and
intrusion
from
citizens
of
the
united
states
who
might
attempt
to
settle
within
the
cherokee
nation
without
their
consent.
they
would
be
removed
by
order
of
the
president.
the
treaties
also
recognized
the
sovereign
right
of
the
cherokee
nation
to
make
and
enact
all
laws
deeded
necessary
for
the
protection
of
their
persons
and
property.
cherokee
law
did
prohibit
travel
in
or
settlement
by
intruders
and
provided
for
the
forfeiture
of
all
improvements
made
by
intruders
unlawfully
residing
in
the
cherokee
domain.
lists
of
names
of
intruders
were
routinely
submitted
to
the
chief
so
that
they
could
in
turn
be
submitted
to
federal
officials
for
their
expulsion.
no
traders
could
come
into
the
cherokee
nation
without
a
federal
license.
the
trade
and
intercourse
acts
of
the
time
provided
for
the
removal
and
forfeiture
of
all
merchandise
of
unlicensed
traders.
cherokee
law
likewise
prohibited
traders
from
coming
into
the
cherokee
nation
without
a
license.
my
point
here
is
that
clearly
the
cherokee
nation
was
a
private
nation
within
a
nation,
and
it
was
not
open
to
the
public
right
of
passage.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
your
honor,
i
am
not
trying
to
say
that
the
cherokee
nation
is
excluding
the
united
states.
what
i
am
saying
is
that
when
the
united
states
exercises
its
power
to
regulate
navigation
in
such
a
way
that
it
takes
property
vested
in
the
cherokee
nation,
that
it
can
create
a
situation
where
there
has
been
a
compensable
taking.
the
navigational
servitude
has
generally
been
applied
without
compensation
to
those
cases
involving
riparian
owners
who
have
acquired
title
from
the
state
pursuant
to
local
rules
of
property
construction.
there
is
no
question
that
where
the
equal
footing
doctrine
reserved
title
for
a
future
state,
that
navigational
servitude
applies.
in
this
case,
however,
the
cherokee
nation
was
uniquely
conveyed
title
to
a
great
tract
of
land
of
which
the
bed
and
banks
of
the
arkansas
are
only
a
fraction.
the
united
states
states
that
there
is
nothing
unusual
with
respect
to
the
navigational
servitude
about
fee
simple
ownership
of
riverbed
interests,
citing
cases
where
states
or
individuals
through
states
acquired
title.
first
of
all,
it
is
very
unusual
that
the
cherokee
nation
was
granted
fee
title
to
navigable
lands.
second,
i
think
this
ignores
the
intent
behind
the
grant.
state
lands
were
always
intended
to
be
public
and
individual
owners
took
accordingly.
cherokee
land
was
intended
to
be
private.
the
cherokee
nation
was
not
a
mere
riparian
owner
but
a
sovereign
nation
in
many
respects.
it
was
promised
freedom
from
state
or
territorial
jurisdiction
and
the
right
of
self-government.
the
cherokee
title
as
granted
was
not
a
qualified
one
certainly
when
viewed
from
the
plain
meaning
of
the
treaties
and
patent.
these
private
rights
were
created
without
any
place
for
public
intervention.
no
state
was
contemplated
in
1838.
the
entire
area
within
the
cherokee
domain
including
the
riverbed
constituted
the
private
property
of
the
cherokee
nation.
the
right
to
develop
their
property
is
a
vested
property
right.
as
this
court
has
already
recognized,
neither
congress
intended
nor
the
cherokees
understood
that
they
be
precluded
from
developing
their
mineral
rights.
after
repeated
betrayals,
a
forced
removal,
and
a
unique
fee
patent
to
their
new
private
home,
i
would
submit
that
the
cherokees
have
a
reasonable
investment-backed
expectation
to
use
their
property
free
from
public
interference.
congress
intended
to
preserve
a
way
of
life.
in
their
eastern
lands
the
cherokees
used
the
streams
and
rivers
as
avenues
of
transportation
for
food,
for
irrigation,
and
other
purposes.
they
were
not
nomadic
but
settled
in
towns
and
villages
along
the
rivers.
also
it
is
clear
that
the
cherokees
made
money
from
the
use
of
the
rivers.
in
both
the
eastern
and
western
homes,
the
cherokees
regulated
public
ferries
crossing
the
many
streams
and
rivers.
cherokee
law
provided
for
taxation,
licensing,
and
manner
of
use.
the
united
states
argues
that
this
court
has
never
deviated
from
the
fundamental
constitutional
principle
that
the
united
states
owes
no
compensation
when
the
government's
navigational
improvements
impair
private
interest
in
navigable
waters.
the
united
states
cites
a
long
line
of
cases
where
the
noncompensable
loss
was
related
either
directly
or
indirectly
to
the
riparian
owner's
access
to
or
use
of
navigable
waters.
as
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
held,
a
determination
of
what
is
compensable
or
not
compensable
should
have
nothing
to
do
with
the
use
of
navigable
waters.
it
is
the
character
of
the
invasion
that
is
determinative.
in
this
case
there
is
not
a
mere
insubstantial
evaluation,
but
millions
of
tons
of
sand
and
gravel
have
been
dredged
away
or
rendered
inaccessible
by
rivetment
constructions--
three
dam
sites
have
been
taken,
two
of
which
are
generating
electricity
with
no
benefit
to
the
tribe.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
but
i
think
in
those
cases,
your
honor,
those
individuals
took
with
the
expectation
that
their
property
would
be
shared
with
the
public
right.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
i
don't
think--
mr.
james
wilcoxen
--that
is
correct,
your
honor,
but
this
is
a
unique
case
where
the
cherokees
had
a
separate
domain,
and
i
don't
think
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
that
their
lands
be
shared
with
the
public.
the
takings
clause
requires
an
examination
of
whether
the
restriction
on
private
property
forces
some
people
alone
to
bear
public
burdens
which
in
all
justice
and
fairness
should
be
borne
by
the
public
at
large.
the
cherokee
nation's
private
property
should
not
be
destroyed
and
used
by
the
united
states
for
public
purposes
without
compensation.
they
should
not
have
to
bear
the
public
burden
of
sacrificing
private
property
solemnly
guaranteed
forever.
upon
extinguishment
of
their
national
title
at
oklahoma
statehood
congress
again
promised
that
their
land
would
not
become
public
land
nor
property
of
the
united
states.
i
would
submit
that
the
cherokee
property
does
have
the
force
of
law
behind
it
to
the
extent
that
this
court
can
compel
the
united
states
to
keep
from
using
its
property
without
making
compensation.
the
reasonable
investment-backed
expectation
of
private
use
in
this
cherokee
case
cannot
be
measured
in
terms
of
dollars.
the
cherokees
lost
over
4,000
lives
and
their
property
in
the
east
during
the
forced
removal
to
gain
their
privacy
in
the
west.
in
this
case
the
trust
relationship
must
also
be
considered.
from
the
earliest
cherokee
decision
this
court
has
recognized
the
special
relationship
between
the
united
states
and
indian
tribes.
in
the
face
of
this
duty,
the
united
states
now
argues
that
the
fiduciary
relationship
is
not
relevant
to
this
controversy
and
that
the
cases
cited
by
the
cherokee
nation
were
decided
on
traditional
legal
standards
notwithstanding
the
trust
powers
of
the
united
states.
the
cherokee
nation
believes
the
united
states'
emphasis
is
misplaced.
cherokee
property
rights
were
established
long
ago
by
treaty
and
patents.
the
trust
relationship
does
establish
an
independent
standard
of
responsibility
requiring
that
treaties
and
agreements
between
a
nation
and
its
dependent
subjects
be
enforced
with
greater
rigor
than
those
with
foreign
nations
or
private
parties
unprotected
by
a
special
guardianship
relationship.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
that
would
be
our
position,
justice
white.
yes.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
i
am
not
saying
that
the
tribe
could
prevent
the
corps
of
engineers
from
using
the
property.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
that's
correct.
i
am
saying
that
if
the
corps
of
engineers
takes
and
uses
this
vested
property
in
such
a
way
that
it
destroys
valuable
deposits,
then
it
must
pay
for
it.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
well,
in
the
past
this
court
has
held
that
the
cherokee
nation
is
subject
to
this
country's
power
of
eminent
domain.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
the
court,
recognizing
cherokee--
mr.
james
wilcoxen
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
in
answer
to
that
that
it
would
not
be
fair
in
the
face
of
the
plain
promises
made
in
the
treaties
and
the
way
the
indians
would
have
understood
them
to
invoke
the
servitude
in
such
a
way
that
it
takes
property
from
the
tribes
without
compensation.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
yes,
your
honor,
it
was
stated
in
the
choctaw
nation
case
that
the
united
states
had
all
it
was
concerned
with
in
retaining
its
navigational
easement
pursuant
to
its
constitutional
power
to
regulate
navigation.
your
honor,
we
are
not
attempting
to
deny
the
united
states
the
power
to
regulate
navigation
but
it
is
the
effect
of
the
exercise
of
that
power--
mr.
james
wilcoxen
--excuse
me?
mr.
james
wilcoxen
well--
mr.
james
wilcoxen
--i
am
saying
that
to
the
extent
that
it
would
divest
property
interests
of
the
cherokee
nation
that
they
thought
that
they
had,
that
compensation
is
due.
the
court
of
appeals,
recognizing
that
cherokee
property
rights
are
constitutionally
protected,
directed
its
opinion
to
this
court's
decision
in
united
states
versus
creek
nation.
while
congress
is
vested
with
the
power
to
manage
and
control
tribal
property
that
power
does
not
extend
so
far
as
to
allow
the
government
to
give
tribal
lands
to
others
or
use
it
for
its
own
purposes
without
rendering
or
assuming
an
obligation
to
render
just
compensation.
to
do
otherwise
would
not
be
an
active
management
but
one
of
confiscation.
congress's
power
to
manage
and
control
tribal
trust
property
is
not
absolute
but
is
subject
to
pertinent
constitutional
restrictions,
including
the
fifth
amendment.
furthermore,
the
duty
to
manage
and
control
cannot
be
preempted
and
subsumed
by
the
navigational
servitude.
congress's
fiduciary
responsibility
to
protect
tribal
property
rights
is
no
less
compelling
in
the
face
of
the
navigational
servitude.
the
power
to
regulate
tribal
affairs
and
the
navigational
servitude
spring
from
the
same
commerce
clause.
regulation
does
not
include
confiscation.
congress
cannot
completely
ignore
one
duty
on
the
one
hand
to
advance
another.
likewise,
it
cannot
simultaneously
act
as
trustee
for
the
benefit
of
the
cherokee
nation
and
promote
and
protect
its
property
interests
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
invoke
its
power
to
regulate
navigation
when
to
do
so
would
take
tribal
property
and
use
it
for
a
public
purpose.
in
any
given
situation
in
which
congress
has
acted
it
must
act
in
one
capacity
or
the
other.
it
is
the
good
faith
effort
on
the
part
of
congress
to
give
the
indians
the
full
value
of
their
land
that
identifies
the
exercise
by
congress
of
its
authority
to
manage
property
of
the
indian
wards
for
their
benefit.
without
that
effort,
congress
could
exercise
sovereign
power
to
regulate
navigation,
thereby
destroying
tribal
property
and
using
it
for
its
own
purposes
without
assuming
an
obligation
to
compensate
the
tribe.
in
this
case,
congress
cannot
be
presumed
to
have
exercised
its
navigational
servitude
with
no
intent
to
compensate
the
cherokees.
the
court
of
appeals
noted
that
special
circumstances
surrounding
the
grant
to
the
cherokee
nation,
particularly
the
series
of
broken
treaties
culminating
in
a
new
set
of
treaties
and
patent
uniquely
granting
fee
title
to
the
cherokee
nations,
to
their
lands
in
the
west,
and
promising
freedom
from
state
and
territorial
jurisdiction.
in
the
face
of
these
circumstances,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
it
must
adhere
to
the
principle
that
treaty
rights
will
not
be
deemed
abrogated
or
modified
absent
a
clear
expression
of
congressional
purpose.
the
intention
to
abrogate
or
modify
a
treaty
is
not
to
be
lightly
imputed
to
congress.
in
neither
the
flood
control
act
of
1944
nor
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
of
1946
was
any
provision
made
for
the
payment
of
compensation
to
the
cherokee
nation
for
the
loss
of
its
property,
but
more
importantly,
the
acts
of
congress
do
not
express
an
intent
to
deprive
the
cherokee
nation
of
its
trust
property
without
compensation.
in
1906,
this
riverbed
property,
remaining
unallotted,
passed
into
trust
with
the
provision
that
it
shall
not
become
public
land
nor
property
of
the
united
states
but
shall
be
held
in
trust
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
indians.
after
oklahoma
statehood,
the
secretary
of
interior
and
the
oklahoma
state
supreme
court
erroneously
concluded
that
the
property
had
passed
to
the
state
of
oklahoma,
and
this
misbelief
persisted
until
this
court's
decision
in
choctaw
nation
versus
u.s.,
397
us
620,
in
1970.
when
congress
authorized
construction
of
the
navigation
project
it
made
no
authorization
to
take
tribal
property.
congressional
intent
should
not
be
implied
to
the
detriment
of
the
cherokee
nation.
when
the
united
states
took
this
property
for
the
mcclellan-kerr
project
without
payment,
it
violated
the
terms
of
its
trust
provision
to
hold
the
property
for
the
use
and
benefit
of
the
tribe.
there
is
nothing
in
the
navigational
servitude
which
absolutely
binds
congress
to
an
intent
to
take
property
without
compensation.
it
is
clearly
not
a
blanket
exception
to
the
fifth
amendment.
the
navigational
servitude
is
not
absolute.
absent
a
clear
expression
of
congressional
intent
to
take
tribal
trust
property
without
compensation,
i
would
say
there
is
a
well-founded
doubt
that
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
tribe.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
that
is
correct,
justice
scalla.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
but
this
truly
is
a
unique
case
that
they
granted
an
indian
tribe
fee
simple
title
to
navigable
lands,
to
lands
below
a
navigable
river.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
that
is
correct,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
but
it
is
clearly
intended
under
those
circumstances
that
those
be
and
remain
public
highways.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
because
the
cherokee
nation
was
set
aside
in
a
separate
domain.
they
had
just
suffered
the
ruinous
effects
of
intrusion
from
white
settlers.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
well,
i
am
saying,
your
honor,
that
there
are
circumstances
in
which
there
can
be
created
compensable
property
rights,
and
i
think
that
the
cherokee
nation
in
the
face
of
its
history
has
a
compensable
property
interest
in
the
riverbed.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
there
were
some
appropriations
to
study
the
river
and
to
remove
snags
in
the
river,
but
i
must
say,
your
honor,
that
that
primarily
took
place
below
fort
smith,
while
some
of
that
did
come
into
this
area,
but
i
don't
think
that
the
removal
of
those
snags
for
the
primary
purpose
of
allowing
navigation
to
fort
gibson
to
supply
the
fort
and
even
to
allow
trading
with
the
cherokee
nation
obviates
the
fact
that
there
was
clearly
intended
to
set
aside
a
private
domain
for
the
cherokee
nation.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
sufficient
an
expression
of
intent
to
open
up
a
public
highway.
otherwise,
settlers
could
have
just
simply
come
up
the
river
with
no
impunity,
and
that
was
not
the
case.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
yes,
your
honor,
it
does.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
well,
both
entities
had
their
own
provisions
to
keep
the
intruders
out.
to
the
extent
that
that
was
divided,
i
can't
say.
but
both
tribal
law
and
the
trade
and
intercourse
acts
prohibited
traders
from
coming
into
the
cherokee
nation.
tribal
law
clearly
prohibited
anybody
from
coming
into
the
cherokee
nation,
and
the
treaty
itself,
the
treaty
of
1835,
clearly
provides
that
settlers
will
be
removed
by
order
of
the
president
of
the
united
states.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
well,
whether
or
not
the
united
states
marched
cavalry
through
the
cherokee
nation,
i
think
that
would
be
an
entirely
separate
situation
than
if
200
american
citizens
just
simply
wanted
to
come
and
sojourn
on
the
cherokee
nation.
mr.
james
wilcoxen
we
think
that
congress
intended
that
the
cherokees
have
every
reasonable
beneficial
economic
value
which
can
be
derived
from
the
riverbed,
including
water
power.
the
value
in
the
flow
of
the
stream
can
be
granted
or
retained
as
the
government
chooses.
as
recognized
by
chief
justice
harlan
stone,
then
attorney
general,
in
34
attorney
general
opinion
171,
as
a
practical
matter
property
rights
include
any
right
to
hidden
or
latent
resources
of
the
land,
such
as
minerals
or
water
power,
even
though
the
indians
had
no
knowledge
of
this
in
their
natural
state.
finally,
it
must
be
understood
that
the
cherokee
nation
does
not
intend
to
debilitate
the
united
states
or
to
prevent
the
united
states
from
the
exercise
of
its
power
to
regulate
navigation,
but
as
this
court
noted
in
the
kaiser
aetna
decision,
444
us,
the
regulation
of
navigation
and
whether
or
not
that
regulation
constitutes
a
fifth
amendment
taking
are
two
entirely
separate
questions.
thank
you.
