why
isn't
the
logic
of
your
argument
that
there
should
be
no
power
in
the
federal
government
to
alter
these
streams
to
improve
navigation
at
all?
a
deal
is
a
deal.
we
gave
these
streams
to
the
cherokee,
and
the
corps
of
engineers
shouldn't
be
able
to
go
in
at
all.
why
doesn't
that
follow?
why
should
it
be
subject
to
eminent
domain?
i
mean,
you
know,
the
cherokees
say,
our
deal
was,
we
wanted
new
lands
that
were
our
lands.
justice
antonin
scalia
now
all
of
a
sudden
you
are
changing
this
treaty
and
you
are
making
it,
you
know,
money
instead
of
lands.
we
didn't
want
money.
we
wanted
lands.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know
we
have,
but
that...
i
am
talking
about
the
logic
of
your
argument.
isn't
the
logic
of
your
argument
not
just
that
the
government
must
pay
for
the
exercise
of
its
navigational
authority,
but
that
it
has
no
navigational
authority
whatever?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
really.
you
are
just
saying
it
is
an
illogical
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
question
is
really
whether
there
is
property
to
be
taken.
i
mean,
it
isn't
whether
they
are
taking
it
without
compensation.
it
is
whether
there
is
property
to
be
taken
in
the
first
place.
did
the
tribe
ever
get
the
right
to
have
the
beds
free
from
the
federal
government's
navigational
interest
which
applies
everywhere
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
problem
you
confront
is
that
in
all
other
instances
it
is...
in
all
other
instance
it
is
assumed
that
when
the
federal
government
conveys
property,
even
when
it
conveys
fee
title,
it
does
not
convey
that
little
bit
that
consists
of
its
right
to
deepen
the
bed
of
the
stream
or
otherwise
improve
navigation.
why
should
one
feel
differently
in
this
case?
you
can't
cite
a
single
other
case
where
the
united
states
has
conveyed
land
where
it
has
not
implicitly,
without
saying
so,
reserved
that
particular
right
so
that
that
piece
of
property
is
not
conveyed.
why
should
we
think
it
has
been
conveyed
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
way
there
is
even
less
reason
to
think
that
the
federal
government
was
giving
it
all
away
here,
that
navigational
servitude
that
it
holds.
if
i
am
correct
the
plans
for
making
improvements
on
the
river
were
in
existence.
the
corps
of
engineers
was
already
looking
jealously
at
this
particular
river
before
the
treaty
was
entered
into.
isn't
that
so?
