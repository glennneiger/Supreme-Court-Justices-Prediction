mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
constitutional
principle
that
governs
this
case
has
been
well
established
by
the
court.
the
court
has
decided
at
least
a
dozen
protected
liberty
interest
cases
and
in
every
case
the
court
used
the
very
same
analysis
to
determine
whether
a
protected
liberty
interest
exists.
in
essence,
that
analysis
requires
the
asking
of
a
single
question:
is
agency
discretion
limited
by
a
mandatory
standard,
or
is
agency
discretion
unlimited.
in
every
case
in
which
agency
discretion
was
limited
by
a
mandatory
standard,
this
court
has
voted
nine
to
nothing
that
the
state
therefore
had
created
a
protected
liberty
interest.
greenholtz,
enomoto,
hewitt,
morrissey,
wolff,
were
all
unanimous
decisions
on
that
point.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
justice
white,
that's
essentially
the
dumschat
case,
and
this
court
held
that
there
was
no
protected
interest.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
the
statute
in
dumschat,
your
honor,
was
essentially
that,
that
the
connecticut
board
of
pardons
shall
have
the
power
to
grant
parole.
there
were
no
criteria
and
no
standards
set
forth.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
that
would
be--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
your
honor,
essentially
your
hypothetical
is
very
similar
to
the
way
that
the
statute
was
in--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--that's
a
standard.
in
fact,
the
securities
act
authorizes
the
sec
to
act
and
to
decide
instances
in
the
public
interest.
that,
like
th
montana
parole
bord--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--that
would
be
a
less
favorable
case
than
our
case
here.
our
statute
says,
you
shall
grant
parole,
and
justice
scalia
mentioned
some
very
key
language
there,
subject
to--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--and
as
i
understand
your
question,
the
only
criteria
is
that--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--when
you
feel
like
it.
i
would
say
probably
not,
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
yes,
i
would
analogize
that
to
the
dumschat
case.
in
dumschat
the
statute
was,
you
shall
have
the
power
to
grant
parole,
and
this
court
held
that
merely
having
the
power
to
do
something,
unfettered,
without
any
standards
to
guide
the
decision
maker.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
that's
correct.
well,
actually--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--the
statute
is,
as
you
read
it,
justice
scalia,
starts
out
by
saying,
"subject
to
the
following
restrictions
the
board
shall
grant
parole.
"
and
then
the
statute
proceeds
to
list
three
restrictions
on
that
power.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
that's
the
second
restriction.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
and
each
of
them
has
to
be
satisfied.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
no,
that
would
be
a
liberty
interest.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
no.
for
example,
the
parole
statute
that
montana
had
initially
would
not.
that
parole
statute
said
that
the
board
may
grant
parole
subject
to
the
conditions
it
deemed
expedient.
montana
1955
drastically
eliminated...
or
revised
that
and
imposed
three
restrictions
on
the
board.
the
legislature
obviously
intended
to
restrict
their
power
and
they
are
refusing
to
recognize
that
fact.
there
is
a
vast
difference--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--under
this
court's
decision,
particularly
hewitt
versus
helms
which
the
chief
justice
wrote
for
the
court,
the
court
has
established
the
principle
that
where
you
have
mandatory
language
ordering
an
agency
that
it
shall
or
must
do
something,
combined
with
a
standard,
a
limitation
that
creates
a
federal
protected
liberty
interest.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
your
honor,
there
were
two
standards
that
this
court
cited
in
hewitt.
one
was
the
need
for
control
and
the
other
was
a
serious
threat
to
institutional
security.
i
believe
that
those
were
the
two
standards.
i
don't
feel
that
those
standards
are
any
more
specific
than
my
standards.
however,
the
critical
point
in
this
is
not
how
broad
the
standards
are
but
whether
there
are
any
standards.
there
is
an
enormous
constitutional
distinction
between
having
broad
standards
and
having
no
standards.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
not
under
the
rulings
of
this
court.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
meaning
it
is
a
control
over
discretion.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
what
i
am
saying
is
that
under
the
rulings
of
this
court,
it
is
clear
that
as
soon
as
you
impose
that
kind
of
standard
on
an
administrative
agency
and
they
must
come
to
a
finding
that--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--yes,
it
would
have.
what
this
court
has
stated
in--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--what
this
court
has
required
in
administrative
law
is
an
intelligible
principle.
for
example,
what
is
restraint
of
trade?
what
is
unfair
competition?
legislatures
make
these
kinds
of
delegations
to
quasi-administrative
agencies
all
the
time.
this
is
exactly
what
has
occurred
here.
the
montana
legislature
has
decided
to
confer
on
this
administrative
agency
the
power
and
the
duty
to
grant
parole
and
it
has
set
forth
three
restrictions
on
that
power.
as
soon
as
it
has
limited
the
discretion
of
the
agency
under
federal
law,
that
creates
a
protected
liberty
interest.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
justice
o'connor,
i
would
agree
with
that,
and
the
word
that
i
used
is
a
word
that
i
borrowed
from
supreme
court
decisions,
that
there
has
to
be
an
intelligible
principle.
however,
this
court
for
very
obvious
and
good
reasons
has
not
delved
into
whether
a
restriction
is
a
massive
restriction
or
a
less
massive
restriction
because
essentially,
what
that
boils
down
to
is
an
interpretation
of
state
law.
for
example,
finishing
a
question
that
justice
scalia
had
asked
me,
is
that
in
this
case,
because
montana...
the
montana
legislature
has
decided
to
use
this
particular
language
it
is
up
to
the
montana
courts
to
decide
what
is
in
the
public
interest
in
montana.
it
is
up
to
the
montana
courts
to
decide
when
the
release
of
a
prisoner
would
be
to
the
detriment
of
the
prisoner
or
the
community.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
for
the
same
reason
that
this
court
went
ahead
in
greenholtz,
because
all
that
is
necessary
is
to
determine
if
there
is
a
limitation
and
not
how
massive
that
limitation
is,
because
that
would
immediately
get
this
court
into
interpreting
state
law.
the
court's
duty
ends,
and
responsibility
to
interpret
these
statutes,
begins
and
ends
with
determining
whether
the
state
has
placed
a
limitation
on
agency
discretion.
this
is
what
this
court
decided
in
lowdermill
also.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
no,
i
would
agree
with
your
honor.
any
meaningful
limitation,
in
other
words,
not
a
limitation,
"whenever
you
feel
like
it".
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
that
also
would
be
a
more
difficult
case
than
we
have
here.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
yes,
i
would
agree
with
you,
it
is.
in
other
words
they
would
have
to
explain
to
the
inmate
why
he
or
she
did
not
deserve
it.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
not
unless
there
is
a
protected
liberty
interest.
then,
under
greenholtz...
greenholtz
did
decide
the
question
of
what
processes
do,
a
question
that
is
not
reached
in
this
case.
the
chief
justice
asked
my
opponent
about
that.
we
have
not--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--i
would
say
that
that
created
a
protected
liberty
interest.
it
would
not
be
as
clear
as
in
this
case,
however.
there
are
two
points
that
are
very
compelling
here.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
i
would
also
say
it
is
a
liberty
interest.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
especially
if
you
tagged
on
something
that's
very--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--in
which
you
have
to
explain
because
that
tells
the
agency
that
there
is
a
requirement.
like
here,
the
montana
legislature
has
authorized
judicial
review.
that
indicates
that
the
montana
legislature
obviously
anticipated
that
there
would
be
findings
that
there
are
meaningful
restrictions.
otherwise,
judicial
review
would
make
no
sense.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
no.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
and
this
court
has
rejected
that.
it
is
not
sufficient
to
trigger
the
due
process
clause
that
a
state
simply
establish
procedures,
and
i
am
not
arguing
that.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
yes,
we
can.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
that's
right,
and
that
is
appendixed
to
the
greenholtz
decision.
those
were
the
same
factors
that
are
contained
in
the
model
penal
code
that
nebraska
adopted
and
this
court,
nine
to
nothing,
held
that
those
criteria
were
adequate
to
establish
a
protected
liberty
interest.
that
is
one
of
my
arguments.
in
other
words,
the
montana
board
has
gone
ahead
on
its
own
and
given
substance
to
this
as
administrative
agencies
must,
and
they
have
adopted
the
same
standards
that
nebraska
did
that
were
reviewed
by
this
court
in
greenholtz.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
no,
but
the
critical
distinction,
justice
scalia,
is
this:
the
board
is
allowed
under
this
to
consider
everything
it
considers
relevant,
but
once
it
reaches
an
opinion
its
discretion
ends.
if
it
reaches
an
opinion
that
the
release
of
prisoner
"x"
would
be
a
detriment
to
the
community,
it
must
deny
parole.
its
discretion
does
not
extend
further
than
that.
on
the
other
hand,
if
it
reaches
the
opinion
that
the
release
of
prisoner
"x"
would
not
be
a
detriment
to
the
community
or
to
prisoner
"x"
it
must
grant
parole.
it
is
allowed
to
consider
whatever
it
feels
necessary
to
reach
that
opinion.
the
legislative
history
here
is
exceedingly
important
and
it
offers
irresistible
proof
that
the
montana
legislature
wanted
to
impose
restrictions
on
this
board.
it
took
a
statute
in
existence
in
that
state
for
over
40
years
that
was
filled
with
unfettered
discretion,
and
it
replaced
it
with
a
statute
that
has
the
word
"shall"
and
three
specific
restrictions.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
i
was
aware
at
the
time
that
i
filed
this
lawsuit
about
a
previous
decision
from
the
montana
federal
district
court,
the
campbell
decision
which
was
a
one-paragraph
decision.
it
was
brought
pro
se
by
a
prisoner
and
the
federal
district
court
there
held
that
the
montana
statute
created
no
protected
interest.
i
knew
that
i
was
against
that
decision
and
i
filed--
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
--no...
well,
the
issue
here
is
a
federal
issue.
mr.
stephen
l.
pevar
yes,
i
believe
that
if
i
brought
this
in
montana
i
would
get
the
same
relief
that
i
am
hoping
to
get
here.
what
i
am
asking
for
here
is
nothing
more
than
what
the
supreme
court
gave
to
the
prisoners
in
nebraska,
and
i
do
believe
the
nebraska
statute
and
the
montana
statute
are
legally
indistinguishable.
this
lawsuit
does
not
seek
the
release
of
anyone,
nor
does
it
seek
to
restrict
the
paroling
policies
of
the
state
of
montana.
it
seeks
only
to
ensure
that
the
standards
that
the
montana
legislature
wanted
to
impose
on
this
administrative
agency
are
actually
implemented.
the
standards
that
are
set
forth,
the
restrictions
that
are
set
forth
in
the
statute
and
the
statute...
let
me
back
up
a
second.
in
the
1955
act
the
title
begins
that,
we
are
now
conferring
the
power
on
the
parole
board
to
grant
parole
within
restrictions.
that
same
crucial
word
"restrictions"
is
then
carried
forth
into
this
parole
statute.
and
the
parole
statute
begins,
"subject
to
the
following
restrictions,
the
parole
board
shall
grant
parole.
"
and
then
it
lists
three
restrictions.
those
restrictions
are
certainly
not
any
less
broad
than
the
restrictions
and
that
the
limitations
that
this
court
has
in
five
nine-to-nothing
decisions
recognized,
that
they
create
a
protected
liberty
interest.
the
standards
in
vitek,
for
example,
were
that
placing...
or
transferring
an
inmate
to
a
mental
hospital,
first
of
all
the
statute
there
said
"may",
and
then
the
only
criteria
was
that
it
will
endanger
the
public
safety.
and
the
court
said
that
that
created
a
protected
liberty
interest.
what
is
crucial
here
is
that
their
hands
are
tied.
there
is
a
limit
to
the
outer
reaches
of
their
discretion.
they
cannot
deny
parole
for
any
reason
that
they
want
to,
and
they
must
grant
parole
in
a
certain
situation.
indeed,
counsel
conceded
that
crucial
point.
he
conceded
when
he
was
up
here
that
if
the
board
finds
that
a,
b,
and
c,
the
three
restrictions
set
forth
in
the
statute,
are
met
the
prisoner
must
be
granted
parole.
that
is
our
case.
that
is
all
we
are
asking
this
court
to
find.
because
under
this
court's
decisions
those
prisoners,
therefore,
have
a
legitimate
expectation
of
release
and
that
is
what
this
court
found
in
greenholtz.
unless
there
are
further
questions,
i
have
completed
my
presentation.
