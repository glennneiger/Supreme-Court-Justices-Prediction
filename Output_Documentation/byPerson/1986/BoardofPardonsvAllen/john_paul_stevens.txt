justice
stevens
general
smith,
may
i
just
ask,
the
statute
certainly
doesn't
give
them
that
right
because
it
says
they
can't
be
released
unless
they
meet
the
time
requirement,
but
it
says
they
shall
be
released
when,
in
the
opinion
of
the
board,
there
is
reasonable
probability
the
prisoner
can
be
released
without
detriment
to
the
prisoner
or
to
the
community.
is
it
your
view
they
don't
have
a
duty
to
release
him
even
when
they
make
that
finding?
justice
stevens
so,
he
has
a
right
to
release
if
those
conditions
are
met?
justice
stevens
--may
i
just
be
sure
i
understand
your
position,
general
smith.
if
there
is
no
liberty
interest
at
all,
does
that
mean
in
your
view
that
the
parole
board
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
at
least,
could
whenever
a
prisoner
served
the
requisite
time
and
he
files
an
application
for
parole,
reciting
what
the
statute
says,
and
he
says
that
he
thinks
he
can
behave
in
the
community
and
so
forth,
that
the
parole
board
could
simply
say,
"we're
just
not
going
to
look
at
your
application
because
we're
busy
doing
other
things.
"
"we
will
arbitrarily
deny
it
for
the
next
six
months.
"
could
they
do
that,
consistently
with
the
constitution?
do
they
have
any
obligation
to
decide
whether
he
is
entitled
to
parole
or
not?
justice
stevens
well,
i
don't
think
that
answers
my
question.
my
question
is,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
is
it
your
position
that
the
board
could
simply
say,
"we
will
not
even
review
your
application.
"
"you
have
no
liberty
interest;
therefore
we
have
no
obligation
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
to
even
take
a
look
at
the
darned
thing?
"
that
is
what
your
position
is,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
well,
what
is
at
stake
here?
i
don't
quite
understand
what
the
dispute
is
all
about.
i
thought
that
was
your
position
too.
i
don't
see
how--
justice
stevens
--and
your
answer
is
no,
there
are
none.
therefore
you
can
just,
as
a
matter
of
federal
law,
you
can
say,
"we're
sorry,
we're
not
going
to
open
or
even
read
your
application.
"
justice
stevens
but
you
do
have
some
duties
as
a
matter
of
state
law
but
you
say
they
are
not
sufficient
to
impose
any
duties
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
justice
stevens
is
that,
and
any
relevant
reason
may
be
used
to
deny
or
to
grant
parole?
justice
stevens
because
i
thought
you
said,
it
may
grant
parole
for
any
of
the
following
reasons,
"a"
to
"m"
and
then
it
added,
"for
any
relevant
other
reason".
justice
stevens
are
the
"a"
to
"m"
reasons
for
granting
or
reasons
for
denying?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
just
this,
general
smith.
in
your
view
did
the
1055
statute
change
the
law
in
any
respect,
or
was
it
just
precatory?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
increased
or
decreased
the
amount
of
discretion
in
the
parole
board?
justice
stevens
you
earlier
said
you
thought
it
was
a
substantial
change
in
the
law.
now,
you
say
it
was
really
no
change.
justice
stevens
purely
procedure,
no
change
in
the
substantive
criteria,
though?
