justice
white
doesn't
he
expect
it
be
decided
in
his
favor?
justice
white
well,
is
it
your
position
that...
i
guess
the
complaint
here
is
that
the
board
not
only
didn't
grant
parole
but
it
didn't
say
why.
justice
white
and
it
doesn't
make
findings.
do
you
say
that
because
there
is
not
a
liberty
interest
there
is
just
no
constitutional
imperative
that
the
board
make
the
findings
the
statute
states,
or
deals
with?
justice
white
doesn't
require
them
to
write
it
down
or
to
say
anything
to
the
applicant?
justice
white
and
the
court
of
appeals,
i
take
it
would,
finding
a
liberty
interest,
does
it
dictate
or
did
it
dictate
that
there
should
be
a
hearing
or--
justice
white
--this
lawsuit
seeks
to
compel
the
board
of
pardons
to
use
proper
criteria
in
determining
a
prisoner's
eligibility
and
also
when
it
denies
parole
to
explain
its
reasons?
justice
white
what
if
the
parole
statute
just
says,
"you
shall"...
to
the
board...
"you
shall
parole
whenever
you
feel
like
granting
a
parole?
"
justice
white
and
even
though
the
statute
purports
to
order
the
board
to
either
feel
like
it
or
not
to
feel
like
it?
justice
white
well,
in
my
example
there
is,
it's
when
you
feel
like
it.
justice
white
a
mandatory
standard.
justice
white
isn't
that
a
mandatory
standard,
you
have
to
decide
you
don't
feel
like
it?
justice
white
how
about
if
the
statute
says
that
you
grant
parole
whenever
you
feel
it's
in
the
public
interest?
justice
white
the
statute
says,
whenever
in
your
uncontrolled
discretion
you
decide
that
it's
in
the
public
interest.
justice
white
what
if
the
statute
says,
within
two
months
after
the
filing
of
an
application
for
parole
you
shall
decide
whether
you
feel
like
it
or
not
and
the
board
just
never...
just
never
does
anything.
there
the
application
lies.
there
has
never
been
an
action
on
it.
is
there
a
liberty
interest
to
the
extent
that
you
may
require
the
board
to
act,
under
federal
law?
justice
white
when
you
feel
like
it?
justice
white
no
liberty
interest
even
though
the
statute
says,
you
have
to
decide
whether
or
not
to
grant
within
two
months?
justice
white
and
each
of
them
as
to
be
satisfied?
justice
white
--well,
what
about
whenever
you
think
the
applicant
deserves
it?
justice
white
i
know,
but
is
it
a
liberty
interest
or
not?
is
there
any...
that's
just
any...
that
is
a
standard,
isn't
it?
justice
white
all
they
have
to
do,
though,
is...
they
don't
need
to
explain
it
to
them.
they
just
say,
"we
don't
think
you
deserve
it.
"
justice
white
a
statute
that
just
doesn't
give
any
standards
other
than
"deserves".
if
you
feel
he
deserves
it,
do
it.
if
you
don't,
don't
do
it.
justice
white
do
you
think
a
statute
says,
parole
a
fellow
whenever
you
feel
like
it,
but
within
two
months
you
have
to
tell
him
that
you've
denied
it
and
you
must
explain
why
you
feel
that
you
are
not
going
to
grant
parole.
now,
is
that
a
liberty
interest?
justice
white
even
though
the
only
standard
is
whether
you
feel
like
it
or
not?
justice
white
yes,
i
did,
exactly.
