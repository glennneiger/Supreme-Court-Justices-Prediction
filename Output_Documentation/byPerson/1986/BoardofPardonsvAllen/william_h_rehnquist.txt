chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
86-461,
the
board
of
pardons
and
henry
burgess
versus
george
allen
and
dale
jacobsen.
mr.
smith,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
did
the
court
of
appeals
say
here,
that
there
was
an
expectation
but
they
didn't
prescribe
any
procedures,
did
they?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
your
contention
is
that
because
the
second
criteria
is
because
it
requires
the
opinion
of
the
board
as
to
reasonable
probability
that
the
prisoner
can
be
released
without
detriment
to
the
community,
that
is
sufficiently
subjective
so
there
is
no
reasonable
expectation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
one
of
the
difficulties
for
me
with
this
case
is
the
very
abstract
proposition
that's
presented.
the
idea,
is
there
a
protected
liberty
interest
kind
of
floating
up
there
in
the
air
and
we
don't
have
any
idea
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
were
the
procedures
that
federal
law
required
to
implement
that
interest.
that's
not
your
fault,
i
realize.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
did
the
plaintiffs
ask
for
in
their
complaint?
what
sort
of
procedures
that
weren't
being
provided
by
the
montana
parole
board
did
they
claim
they
were
entitled
to
as
a
matter
of
federal
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
pevar.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so,
it's
really
just
a
question
of
how
the
statute
is
phrased,
in
a
sense.
if
these
weren't
phrased
as
restrictions
but
it
simply
said,
"the
board
shall
grant
parole
when
it
finds
that
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
society,
that
is
no
liberty
interest?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
then
any
parole
statute
in
the
real
world
is
going
to
confer
a
liberty
interest?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
of
course
the
place
to
litigate
that
would
be
in
the
state
court,
whether
they
are
failing
to
follow
the
commands
of
the
state
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
language
in
hewitt
against
helms
is
a
good
deal
different
than
the
language
here.
it
was
a
good
deal
more
precise,
don't
you
think?
there
was
nothing
about
the
public
interest
or
the
interest
of
society.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
pever,
if
you
are
that
confident
about
montana
law,
why
didn't
you
bring
this
action
in
the
state
court
where
you
could
have
gotten
a
decision
of
the
montana
supreme
court,
probably
in
your
favor
from
what
you
have
said?
chief
justice
rehnquist
would
the
supreme
court
of
montana
have
been
bound
by
the
federal
district
court?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
what
you
want
is
certain
procedures
or
benefits
for
people
who
were
denied
parole,
and
from
what
you
say
the
montana
statute
would
give
these,
quite
obviously.
so,
wouldn't
the
supreme
court
of
montana
have
ruled
in
your...
given
you
as
much
as
you
could
get
from
a
federal
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
pevar.
mr.
smith,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
smith.
the
case
is
submitted.
