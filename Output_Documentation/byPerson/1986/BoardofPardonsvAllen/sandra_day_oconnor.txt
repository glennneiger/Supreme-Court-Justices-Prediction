justice
o'connor
mr.
smith,
do
you
take
the
position
that
montana
state
law
requires
the
state
to
do
exactly
what
greenholtz
would
say
are
the
minimum
requirements
in
any
event
if
it
were
a
matter
of
federal
law;
namely,
an
opportunity
to
be
heard
by
the
prisoner
and
to
give
some
reasons
for
denial?
justice
o'connor
are
they
consistent
with
the
requirements
espoused
in
the
greenholtz
case?
does
montana
state
law
comply
with
what
this
court
said
in
the
majority
opinion
in
greenholtz
was
required
under
the
nebraska
statute?
justice
o'connor
so,
what's
at
stake
here
is
not
any
change
whatever
in
montana's
procedure.
it's
just
the
point
you
are
hoping
we
will
make
that
whatever
montana
requires
is
not
a
federal
requirement?
justice
o'connor
it
wouldn't
alter
your
handling
of
the
cases
at
all?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought
there
might...
the
issue
might
turn
on
the
degree
to
which
discretion
is
limited,
and
your
interpretation
goes
to
the
outer
limits
of
that
and
says
that
virtually
any
language
at
all
constitutes
enough
limit
on
discretion
to
trigger
constitutional
rights
and
it
certainly
would
be
reasonable
to
take
a
different
view
of
that
and
say
there
has
to
be
some
meaningful
limit
to
discretion
before
a
liberty
interest
is
triggered.
justice
o'connor
well,
then
maybe
we
ought
to
have
a
pullman
abstention
here,
or
a
certification
back
to
the
montana
courts.
why
are
we
involved
in
it?
justice
o'connor
not
a
meaningful
limitation
on
discretion,
just
any--
