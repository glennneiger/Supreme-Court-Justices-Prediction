mr.
clay
riggs
smith
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
today
is
straightforward:
does
section
46-23-201
of
the
montana
code
annotated
create
a
liberty
interest
in
parole
release
protected
under
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
facts
giving
rise
to
this
case
are
equally
straightforward.
in
may
1984
the
respondents,
on
behalf
of
themselves
and
all
present
and
future
inmates
at
the
montana
state
prison
initiated
an
action
in
the
united
states
district
court
for
the
district
of
montana
alleging
in
relevant
part
that
the
petitioners,
who
are
the
montana
board
of
pardons
and
its
chairman
had
denied
their
parole
release
application
without
an
appropriately
worded
individual
determination.
attached
to
the
complaint
were
communications
from
the
petitioners
to
the
respondents
stating
that
the
respondents'
parole
applications
had
been
denied
because
of
the
nature
of
their
offenses,
and
further
recommending
that
the
respondents
commence,
or
continue
participation
in
psychological
therapy
programs.
in
january
of
1985
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
relying
on
this
court's
1979
decision
in
greenholtz
versus
inmates
of
the
nebraska
correctional
and
penal
institute.
the
respondents
appealed
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit,
raising
as
the
only
question
that
presented
before
the
court
today.
in
june
of
last
year
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
the
district
court's
judgment,
finding
that
the
montana
statute
did
create
a
protected
interest.
in
relevant
part
the
montana
law
provides
that
the
board
of
pardons
shall
release
on
parole
any
inmate
who
otherwise
satisfies
certain
specified
minimum
time
of
incarceration
requirements.
when
in
the
board's
opinion
there
is
reasonable
probability
that
the
inmates
may
be
released
without
detriment
to
themselves
or
to
the
community.
the
statute
further
provides
that
the
board
may
release
on
parole
prisoners
only
when
the
board
determines
that
such
release
is
in
the
best
interest
of
society
and
only
when
the
board
concludes
that
the
prisoner
is
able
and
willing
to
fulfill
the
obligations
of
a
law-abiding
citizen.
the
montana
supreme
court
in
a
series
of
cases
commencing
in
the
early
1960's
has
construed
parole
under
our
statute
as
creating
only
a
privilege
or
an
act
of
grace
and
not
a
right.
in
1962
in
the
case
of
goff
versus
state,
the
court
held
in
the
context
of
an
initial
parole
decision
denial
that,
"because
of
the
discretion
vested
our
board
under
our
statute,
such
decisions
were
not
reviewable
by
state
courts.
"
several
years
later
in
another
case,
in
re
frost,
our
court
held
that
merely
because
an
inmate
satisfied
the
minimum
time
of
incarceration
requirement,
that
parole
was
not
automatically
required
under
the
statute.
the
issue
before
the
court
today
must
in
the
petitioner's
view
be
resolved
by
answering
a
single
question:
does
the
montana
law
convey
to
an
inmate
a
reasonable
expectation
of
favorable
action
upon
his
parole
application
simply
by
virtue
of
the
inmate's
having
satisfied
the
minimum
time
of
incarceration
requirements
which
under
the
law
are
a
condition
precedent
to
the
right
to
even
submit
an
application
for
parole
release.
this
is
question
which,
we
respectfully
submit,
was
not
straightforwardly
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals
below,
nor
has
it
been
addressed
directly
by
the
respondents
in
their
briefs
before
this
court
in
this
case.
it
is
a
question
which
the
petitioners
believe
must
be
answered
negatively.
in
resolving
this
question--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--your
honor,
under
our
statute
once
the
board
of
pardons
determines
that
the
facts
underlying
a
particular
parole
application
are
such
that
the
release
can
occur
consistently
with
the
three
criteria
the
statute
specifies,
then
under
our
law
the
board
is
required
to
order
release.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
if
the
board
determines
in
its
discretion
that
those
conditions
are
met,
that
is
correct,
sir.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
three
conditions
are
as
follows:
in
subsection
1
of
36-23-201
the
statute
states
that
a
prisoner
shall
be
released
on
parole
when
in
the
board's
opinion
such
release
can
be
effected
without
detriment
to
the
prisoner
or
to
the
community.
in
subsection
2
of
that
provision
it
states
that
release
shall
only
be
ordered
if
the
best
interests
of
society
will
be
furthered
and
only
when
the
board
concludes
that
the
prisoner
is
able
and
willing
to
fulfill
the
obligations
of
a
law-abiding
citizen.
as
a
consequence,
in
the
petitioner's
view,
the
statute
sets
forth
three
general
criteria
which
govern
its
decision
making.
in
resolving
the
question
before
the
court
today,
the
court
has
substantial
guidance
from
its
previous
prisoner
entitlement
decisions
involving
rights
alleged
or
held
to
arise
under
state
law.
of
particular
importance
today,
of
course,
is
the
greenholtz
decision.
there
the
court
initially
held
that
the
existence
of
the
mere
possibility
of
parole,
at
least
under
a
state
statute,
did
not
give
rise
to
a
protected
interest.
the
rationale
for
the
court's
decision
in
greenholtz
is
especially
pertinent
to
our
case.
because
parole
decisions
depend,
as
the
court
stated
in
greenholtz,
upon
an
amalgam
of
factors
some
of
which
are
objective
but
many
of
which
are
purely
subjective
evaluations
by
board
members
based
upon
their
expertise
or
experience
in
the
difficult
and
sensitive
task
of
evaluating
the
advisability
of
parole
release,
there
is
no
set
of
facts
which
have
shown
mandates
a
favorable
decision
to
the
inmate.
stated
another
way,
under
a
typically
worded
parole
statute
in
this
country
an
inmate
has
no
legitimate
expectation
at
the
outset
of
the
parole
application
process
that
a
board
will
rule
favorably
upon
his
application
because
the
nature
of
the
decision
making
that
goes
into
that
determination
is
so
general
and
so
subjective.
thus,
as
the
court
further
noted
in
greenholtz,
a
prisoner
has
at
most
a
unilateral
hope
that
the
benefit
sought
will
be
obtained,
but
not
a
reasonable
expectation
of
affirmative
relief
from
the
involved
decision
maker.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
directly
address
the
question
of
whether
a
reasonable
expectation
of
parole
release
arises
simply
by
virtue
of
a
prisoner
satisfying
certain
time
of
incarceration
requirements.
the
court
of
appeals
instead
apparently
stated
that,
"because
our
statute
requires
release
when
the
board
determines
that
the
three
general
criteria
that
i
referred
to
before
are
satisfied,
that
the
construct
of
the
statute
is
such
as
to
create
a
reasonable
expectation...
excuse
me,
to
create
a
liberty
interest.
"
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
petitioner's
view
of
the
statute
is
that
it
sets
forth
three
general
criteria.
the
criteria
that
the
chief
justice
just
referred
to
is
the
first
that
appears
in
subsection
1.
there
are
two
others
in
subsection
2.
it
is
the
petitioner's
position
that
because
those
criteria,
taken
in
the
aggregate,
impose
such
general
release
considerations
that
an
inmate
can
have
no
reasonable
expectation
that
his
set
of
facts
will
be
deemed
by
the
board
to
warrant
favorable
action
on
his
parole
or
release
application.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that
is
correct.
stated
another
way,
your
honor,
the
board
must
conclude
that
the
facts
underlying
a
particular
parole
release
application
are
such
that
its
action
to
effect
parole
is
not
constrained
or
inconsistent
by
any
of
the
three
criteria.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--the
statute
does
not
require
the
board
to
make
specific
findings
with
respect
to
a
particular
parole
release
application.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
second
claim
for
relief
in
the
complaint
states
that
the
due
process
clause
was
violated,
or
is
being
violated,
by
the
absence
of
an
appropriate
hearing
process.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
no,
your
honor,
it
did
not.
the
only
question
before
the
court
below
was
that
upon
which
the
complaint
in
the
district
court
had
been
dismissed,
namely
whether
our
statute
in
the
first
instance
creates
a
protected
liberty
interest.
there
was
no
issue
of
whether...
if
it
did
create
a
protected
liberty
interest,
the
hearing
processes
accorded
the
respondents
sufficed
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
i
believe
that
question
must
be
answered
with
reference
to
the
statute
itself.
it
states
that
within
two
months
of
a
prisoner's
eligibility
date
for
initial
consideration,
in
other
words
within
two
months
of
that
date
upon
which
he
has
served
the
minimum
time
of
incarceration
required
in
the
statute
for
consideration,
the
board
must
review
his
files.
there
is
no
requirement
in
that
provision
for
hearing
unless
it
grants
a
parole
release
application.
however,
a
later
provision
states
that
any
person
who
wishes
to
appear
before
the
board
shall
be
allowed
to
appear
before
the
board.
so,
if
an
inmate
submitted
a
parole
release
application,
and
not
all
do
at
such
time
they
become
eligible
to
submit
an
application,
but
if
an
inmate
does
submit
an
application
and
does
wish
to
appear
before
the
board,
then
the
board
will
schedule
an
interview.
typically
the
board
does
that
even
without
a
request.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that
is
not
our
position,
your
honor.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
what
is
at
stake
here,
petitioners
believe,
is
whether
any
constraints
are
imposed
upon
its
decision
making
process
by
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that
is
correct,
but
as
a
matter
of
state
law
there
may
be
certain
enforceable--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--no.
as
the
court
held
in
hewitt
versus
helms
and
in
olin
versus
wakinekona,
the
mere
existence
of
mandated
procedures
in
a
penal
system
setting
does
not
in
itself
give
rise
to
a
protected
liberty
interest
or
warrant
protection
in
and
of
itself
under
the
due
process
clause.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
it
is
our
position
that
the
current
procedures
being
utilized
by
the
board
are
consistent
with
due
process
requirements,
but
again
that
is
an
issue
which
has
not
been
litigated.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
i
believe
it
does.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
well,
what
i
would
state
is
that
the
respondents
might
disagree
with
my
contention,
and
it
might
be
a
matter
of
substantial
litigation
below
at
the
district
court
level,
or
a
protected
interest
to
be
held
created
by
the
statute.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
case,
of
course,
went
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
dismissal
of
complaint
for
failure
to
state
a
claim,
and
since
it
was
a
singular
discrete
issue
presented
and
that
issue
was
the
only
question
addressed
by
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--well,
the
complaint
is
particularly
skeletal
in
nature
and
did
not
set
forth
the
precise
kinds
of
procedures
that
the
respondents
believed
would
be
appropriate
under
the
due
process
clause.
they
suggested
in
their
first
claim
for
relief
that
parole
applications
were
being
denied
inconsistently
with
the
criteria
in
the
statute.
they
suggested
in
the
second
claim
for
relief
that
the
parole
release
applications
were
being
denied
without
an
appropriate
hearing.
there
was
a
third
claim
based
on
the
eighth
amendment
that
is
not
relevant
to
our
case
today.
so,
to
answer
your
question,
the
complaint
is
not
of
much
assistance
in
what
respondents
believe
is
appropriate
in
this
case.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
that's
right.
but
again,
i
would
suggest
that
for
this
case
to
be
litigated
on
the
merits
of
what
amount
of
process
is
due,
the
issue
would
expand
beyond
a
mere
explanation
and
greater
detail
of
the
reason.
there
may
be
other
hearings,
for
example,
access
to
files
or
perhaps
whether
or
not
notice
of
hearings
is
timely
given,
matters
of
those
kinds
that
are
not
directly
mentioned
or
referred
to
in
the
complaint
but
which
nonetheless
might
well
become
an
issue
before
the
district
court.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
your
honor,
the
statutory
construct
in
the
nebraska
statute
in
greenholtz
stated
that
a
prisoner
shall
be
released
unless
the
nebraska
board
of
parole
determined
that
one
of
four
statutory
criteria
for
deferral
existed.
there
was,
therefore,
a
presumptive
right
absent
an
affirmative
finding
by
the
nebraska
board
to
parole
release.
under
our
statute
there
is
no
presumptive
right
to
parole
release
because
at
all
times
the
inmate
is
required
to
justify
his
eligibility
for
release
consistently
with
the
criteria
under
the
statute.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
principal
difference
is
a
difference
which
the
court
of
appeals
has
noted,
is
that
there
is
under
the
nebraska
statute,
again
a
presumptive
right
to
release
simply
upon
fulfilling
certain
minimum
eligibility
requirements
under
nebraska
law.
those
requirements
also
relate
to
time
of
incarceration.
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
the
difference
between
the
nebraska
law
and
not
only
the
montana
statute
but
virtually
every...
a
large
majority
of
parole
statutes
in
this
country
which
contain
release
criteria
comparable
or
almost
identical
to
those
in
the
montana
law,
lies
not
in
the
amount
of
discretion
which
is
given
to
the
parole
decision
makers,
but
in
the
unique...
as
the
court
put
it
in
greenholtz...
structure
and
language
of
the
nebraska
statute
which
in
essence
created
a
presumptive
right
subject
to
the
feasance
in
favor
of
parole
release.
i
would
further
note
that
there
was
an
absence
in
the
greenholtz
case,
and
it
was
noted
in
the
majority
opinion,
of
any
relevant
state
decisional
authority
construing
the
scope
of
an
inmate's
entitlement
or
interest
under
the
nebraska
statute.
none
was
cited
in
the
briefs
before
the
court
and
none,
of
course,
was
cited
in
the
court's
opinion
itself.
montana,
on
the
other
hand,
has
through
the
series
of
decisions
that
i
have
made
reference
to,
consistently
construed
parole
release
under
our
statute
as
a
matter
of
grace
or
privilege
and
not
of
right.
so,
there
are
both
technical
differences
in
the
construct
of
the
language
between
the
statutes
and
existing
state
authority
construing
the
scope
of
the
right
under
that
statute
that
distinguish
this
case
meaningfully,
we
believe,
from
greenholtz.
in
conclusion
i
would
simply
note
that
because
the
question
which
we
believe
must
be
answered
in
this
case
is
whether
our
statute
creates
a
reasonable
expectation
of
parole
release.
the
respondents'
suggestion
that
any
statute
which
imposes
substantial
limitations
on
a
decision
maker's
discretion
would
essentially
eviscerate
the
first
holding
in
greenholtz
which
was
that
the
mere
existence
of
a
right
to
parole
release
does
not
give
rise
to
a
protected
interest.
it
seems
quite
obvious
that
the
respondents
are
uncomfortable
with
the
well-established
standard
and
that
as
a
consequence
they
have
been
forced
into
the
position
of
arguing
the
creation
of
a
new
standard.
we
believe
that
standard
is
inappropriate
in
a
prison
system
setting
and
we
urge
that
the
court
of
appeals'
judgment
be
reversed.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
there
are
just
three
points
i
would
like
to
cover
in
my
reply
argument.
first,
as
justice
scalia
pointed
out,
through
its
regulations,
specifically
in
section
20.25.505,
the
montana
board
has
adopted
many
of
the
criteria,
in
fact
all
the
criteria
contained
in
the
model
penal
code
with
respect
to
determining
parole
release
applications.
there
are,
however,
two
critical
differences.
in
the
introductory
paragraph
in
that
section
the
word
"shall"
has
been
changed
to
"may"
so
that,
the
board
may
order
parole
unless
it
determines
that
one
of
the
reasons
for
deferral
does
not
exist.
then
secondly,
it
has
added
subsection
"m",
any
other
relevant
reason,
which
does
not
appear
in
the
model
penal
code.
it
did,
however,
appear
in
the
nebraska
statute.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
presumably
both.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
the
administrative
regulation
states
that
the
board
may
grant
parole
unless
it
determines
that
one
of
four
reasons
for--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--well,
in
the
second
section
of
that
portion,
it
lists
various
factors
which
may
be
considered
by
the
board
in
determining
whether
to
defer
or
to
grant
release
and
the
last
of
those
factors
is
factor
"m"
and
it
states,
"any
other
relevant
reason".
in
conclusion,
i
would
simply
note
that
the
proposed
standard
suggested
for
resolving
this
case
by
the
respondents
is
in
fact
no
standard
whatsoever.
it
is
a
standard
which
essentially
repudiates
the
reasoning
of
the
court's
prisoner
entitlement
cases
beginning
with
the
1974
decision
in
wolff
versus
mcdonald.
it
leaves
state
decision
makers,
if
adopted,
in
the
quandary
of
determining
at
best
fine
and
at
worst
almost
metaphysical
questions
concerning
the
degree
of
discretion
that
exists
under
a
particular
state
statute.
it
is
a
standard
which
is
not
workable.
it
is
a
standard
which
bears
no
support
from
previous
decisions
of
this
court
and
it
is
a
standard
which
we
respectfully
submit
should
not
be
adopted.
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
i
think
the
'55
law
changed
the
procedures
and
the
substantive
law
significantly.
i
would
simply
note
that
the
term,
"subject
to
restrictions",
works
both
ways
and
for
example--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--i
believe
it
had
no
measurable
impact
on
the
discretion
of
the
parole
board
since
presumably
it
will
make
its
decision
based
on
the
facts
and
the
criteria
are
so
broad
as
to
allow
it
to
make
its
decision
on
any
factor
it
deems--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--it
was
a
substantial
change
in
the
law
because
it
imposed
various
procedures
and
it
set
forth--
mr.
clay
riggs
smith
--well,
to
the
extent
that
it
required
the
board
to
determine
that,
for
example,
a
prisoner's
release
was
in
the
best
interests
of
society,
i
suppose
under
prior
law
it
could
have
determined
that
a
release
was
not
in
the
best
interests
of
society
but
the
prison
was
too
overcrowded
so
it
was
going
to
release
the
prisoner
anyway.
under
the
new
law,
of
course,
that
discretion
is
minimized,
so
there
may
have
been
some
incremental
change
in
discretion
but
it
certainly
bears
no
logical
relationship
to
whether
the
statute
creates
a
reasonable
expectation
of
release.
that,
we
believe,
is
the
controlling
standard
in
this
case,
your
honor.
thank
you.
