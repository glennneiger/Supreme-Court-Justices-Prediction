what
are
the
three
conditions?
justice
scalia
general
smith,
would
you
tell
me
precisely
why
you
think
that
the
discretion
conferred
upon
your
prison
officials
is
greater
and
therefore
the
expectation
of
release
is
less
in
this
case
than
it
was
in
greenholtz?
i
mean,
greenholtz
had
some
pretty
flabby
language
too.
it
said
the
board
of
paroles
shall
order
release
unless
it
is
of
the
opinion
that
release
should
be
deferred
because
a,
substantial
risk
he
shall
not
conform
to
the
conditions
of
parole.
well,
that's
not
too
bad.
b,
his
release
would
depreciate
the
seriousness
of
his
crime
or
promote
disrespect
for
the
law.
well,
you
know,
that's
not
a
very
tight
condition.
or,
c,
his
release
would
have
a
substantially
adverse
effect
on
institutional
discipline.
or,
d,
his
continued
correctional
treatment
will
substantially
enhance
his
capacity
to
lead
a
law-abiding
life
when
released
at
a
later
date.
you
could
drive
a
truck
through
those
things,
couldn't
you?
does
somebody
really
say
he
could
count
on
being
released
in
greenholtz,
and
why
is
your
system
conferring
any
more
discretion
than
that
did?
justice
scalia
why
is
that,
because
of
the
"unless"?
i
mean,
instead
of
using
"unless"
all
your
statute
does
is
use
"subject
to".
in
nebraska
it
said,
"he
shall
be
released
unless".
your
statute
says,
"subject
to
the
following
restrictions
the
board
shall
release.
"
i
don't
see
a
whole
lot
of
difference
between
saying,
"you
shall
do
it
unless",
or
"subject
to
these
restrictions
you
shall
do
it.
"
it
seems
to
me
to
be
the
same
thing.
justice
scalia
and
you
are
hinging
your
case
upon
the
clear
distinction
between
that,
and
that
is
do
it
when
you
feel
like
it,
and
do
it
only
when
it's
in
the
best
interests
of
society?
justice
scalia
that's
a
real
limitation
upon
somebody's
discretion?
justice
scalia
"parole
shall
be
ordered
only
for
the
best
interests
of
society.
"
justice
scalia
do
you
remember
the
schecter
case,
the
only
case
in
which
this
court
has
ever
struck
down
a
delegation
to
executive
authority
on
the
basis
that
it
was
delegation
of
legislative
powers?
do
you
think
that...
i
forget
what
the
language
of
the
delegation
was
there.
it
essentially
let
the
president
do
whatever
he
wanted
with
the
economy,
but
it
might
have
said
the
president
can
do
whatever
he
wants
to
the
economy
but
only
if
it
is
in
the
best
interests
of
society.
do
you
think
that
that
would
have
been
enough
to
save
schecter
if
it
said
that?
justice
scalia
which
would
mean
it
really
is
not
any
control
over
discretion
at
all
simply
to
say,
"the
best
interests
of
society"?
justice
scalia
you
think
schechter
would
have
come
out
the
other
way
if
it
had
only
said
that
the
president
has
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
society?
justice
scalia
and
schechter
would
have
come
out
the
other
way?
i
am
asking
about
schechter.
if
shechter
had
had
that
standard
that
would
have
been
enough
to
do
the
trick?
justice
scalia
i
thought
the
president
had
taken
an
oath
under
the
constitution
to
act
in
the
best
interests
of
society
anyway,
more
or
less.
justice
scalia
you
are
creating
a
quite
different
theory
of
law.
you
are
saying
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
have
bee
deprived
of
any
liberty
or
property
within
the
meaning
of
the
constitution.
if
you
are
given
a
procedural
right
by
statute
you
have
an
entitlement
to
that
procedural
right.
that's
basically
what
you're
arguing;
it
doesn't
matter
whether
you
have
really
been
deprived
of
liberty
or
not.
whatever
procedural
rights
the
statute
gives
you,
you
are
entitled
to?
justice
scalia
no?
justice
scalia
we
should
consult
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
as
to
how
much
discretion
there
is.
couldn't
we
consult
the
regulations
that
have
been
issued?
justice
scalia
the
regulations
say,
section
20.25.505,
criteria
for
parole
grant
decisions:
"in
making
its
determination
regarding
the
committed
offender's
release
the
board
shall
take
into
account
each
of
the
following
factors.
"
then
it
lists
however
many
down
to
"n"
is,
and
"n"
is
"any
other
factors
the
board
determines
to
be
relevant.
"
any
other
factors?
justice
scalia
how
could
they
have
gone
further
than
to
say,
any
other
factors?
i
mean,
make
believe
you
are
charged
and
they
say,
you
know...
the
attorney
general
calls
you
in
and
says,
"pevar,
get
me
the
broadest
discretion
i
can.
"
could
you
do
any
better
than
to
say,
"any
other
factors
you
consider
relevant?
"
