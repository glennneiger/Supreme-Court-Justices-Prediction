mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
initially,
i'm
going
to
go
through
a
brief
background
of
the
case
and
the
facts.
i
will
then
proceed
to
the
correspondence
issue,
and
then
discuss
the
marriage
issue.
at
present,
unless
there's
questions
concerning
the
findings
of
facts
and
conclusions
of
law,
i'll
leave
those
for
the
argument
on
the
briefs.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
prisons;
specifically,
about
the
level
of
deference
that
is
going
to
be
given
to
prison
officials
to
act
upon...
to
act
upon
legitimate
security...
their
legitimate
security
interests
concerning
the
regulation
of
inmate-to-inmate
correspondence
and
inmate
marriages.
this
is
a
class
action
that
was
brought
pursuant
to
42
u.s.c.
1983,
which
challenged
the
missouri
department
of
corrections
regulations
that...
regulations
concerning
the
inmate-to-inmate
correspondence
and
inmate
marriage
problems.
the
district
court
and...
the
district
court
found
that
those
regulations
were
far
more
restrictive
than
necessary...
for
necessariness,
and
held
them
unconstitutional--
this
holding
was
affirmed
by
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
the
visit...
the
challenges
to
the
missouri
visitation
regulation,
and
a
damage
issue,
were
found
in
favor
of
the
defendants,
and
were
not
appealed.
the
renz
correctional
center
is
a
complex
prison.
what
i
mean
to...
what
i
mean
to
say
when
i
say
a
complex
prison
is
that
it's
a
co-correctional,
multilevel
security
institution.
at
the
renz
correctional
center,
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
we
had
male
and
female
inmates;
we
had
female
maximum
security
inmates
and
medium
security
inmates;
and
male
minimum
security
inmates.
the...
the
renz
correctional
center
was
also
used
to
hide
inmates
within
the
system.
for
example,
if
somebody
was
concerned
about
their
life
or
something
along
those
lines,
the
renz
center
would
be
used
to
hide
them,
because
the
minimum
security
men
were
located
there.
at
the
present
time,
we
have
undergone
some
changes.
the
renz
correctional
center
medium
security
women
have
been
moved
to
another
institution,
along
with
a
number
of
the
maximum
security.
eventually
there
will
be
a
maximum
security
unit
for
women
at
another
location,
and
we
will
move
the
rest
of
the
women
who
are
now
housed
at
renz
to
that
institution.
however,
renz
will
always
be
a
place
where
we
will
have
some
women
for
medical
care
and
for
special
security
problems.
but
they'll
never
have
the
number
of
women
that
it
had
at
the
time
of
this
trial,
which
was
approximately
250.
the
regulations
at
issue
are
as
follows.
the
correspondence
issue
in
effect
at
the...
at
that
time
did
not
permit
correspondence
between
inmates
in
different
institutions,
whether
it
was
in-state
or
out-of-state,
unless
the
adjustment
classification
team,
which
was
a
team
of
case
workers
who
reviewed
their
files
before
they
permitted
anyone
to
correspond,
to
correspond
with
any
other
inmate
in
another
institution,
unless
it
was
in
their
best
interests.
in
addition,
they
were
permitted
to
correspond
with
relatives
who
are
also
incarcerated
within...
within
the
system.
the
marriage
regulation
did
not
prohibit...
did
not
permit
the
marriage
of...
the
marriage
of
inmates
unless
the
superintendent
determined
there
was
a
compelling
reason.
in
other
words,
the
burden
was
on
the
inmate
to
come
forward
to
the
superintendent
and
present
him
with
a
compelling
reason.
the
eighth
circuit
court
of
appeals...
and
i
believe
the
evidence
would
sustain
that...
is
that
basically
it
was
a
rather
narrow
interpretation;
it
was
only
going
to
be
on
the
basis
that
there
was
a
child
involved,
or
through
a
previous
relationship
before
they
were
incarcerated
that
the
prison
official
or
the
superintendent
would
permit
the
marriage
while
it
was...
while
they
were
in...
in
prison.
the
appellant...
the
appellants
in
this
case
request...
or
the
petitioner
in
this
case
requests
the
court
permit
deference
to
the
prison
officials,
and
that
the
court
require
that
inmates
prove
that
the
prison
officials
have
exaggerated
their
response
to
the
penological
interest
before
they
determine
that
the
regulation
is
overbroad
or
that
it's
unconstitutional.
the
respondents,
on
the
other
hand,
would
burden
the
prison
official
to
demonstrate
a
pattern
of
security
concerns
before
the
regulation
could
be
upheld.
then
there
would
be
a
determination
of
whether
the
exercise
of
the
right
involved,
the
inmate
exercise,
is
in
someway
inherently
dangerous,
or
presumptively
dangerous.
and
then
the
court
would
pick
between
competing
reasonable
alternatives,
or
least
restrictive
alternatives,
to
determine
which
alternative
achieved
this
goal.
there
is
no
debate,
even...
i
don't
believe
there's
any
debate
among
the
parties...
that
even
a
core
right
that
the
respondents
have
argued
deserves
a
strict
scrutiny,
can
be
restricted
in
some
manner
by
the
fact
of
incarceration.
the
question
is,
to
what
extent
can
we
restrict
the
rights
of
inmates
while
they
are
incarcerated.
this
court,
in
previous
first
amendment
cases
and
prison
cases,
has
used
an
analysis...
i'm
using,
to
be
precise,
procunier
v.
martinez...
has
used
an
analysis
which
presented
the
least
restrictive
alternative...
which
presented
the
rational
relation
test.
by
this
examination,
the
court
required
that
the
decision
of
the
correctional
official
be
demonstrated
to
be
an
exaggeration,
an
exaggerated
response
to
a
legitimate
penological
interest
demonstrated
by
substantial
evidence
on
the
record.
in
determining
whether
the
response
has
been
exaggerated,
this
court
has
examined
a
number
of...
a
number
of
factors.
they
first
examined...
identified
the
penological
interest
involved,
whether
it
was
a
security
interest,
rehabilitation
of
inmates,
whether
it
was
deterrence
of
crime
or
the
maintenance
of
internal
order,
the
court
would
always
identify.
in
the
present
case,
the
petitioners
presented
the...
the
security
interest
as
the
predominant
interest
in
upholding
of
the...
in
the
upholding
of
our
regulation
between
inmate-and-inmate
correspondence.
we
also
had
some
rehabilitation
interest,
but
predominantly
it
was
a
security
interest.
we
decided
that
this
was
an
important
issue,
because
we
feel
that
the
control
of
communication
between
inmates
in
institutions
is
critical
to
our
control
of
not
only
inmate...
inmate
violence,
but
inmate
gang
control
and
various
other...
various
other
security
interests
that
we
would
have
in
isolating
inmates
between
institutions
in
missouri.
for
example,
in
missouri,
we
do
have
13
institutions,
and
we
have
the
ability
to
move
them
around.
the
second
interest,
and
the
most
interest
that
this
court
has
examined,
is
whether
the...
the
regulation
itself
was
content-neutral.
and
in
the
present
case,
this
regulation
is
content-neutral.
once
the
regulation
is
approved...
once
the
inmate
is
approved,
and
this
was
a
prior
approval,
the
inmate
was
then
permitted
to
correspond.
we
did
not
in
any
way
censor
any
of
his
correspondence,
or
in
any
way
try
to...
try
to
confine
him
to
what
he
could
write
about
the
institution
in
anyway.
finally,
the
regulation
that
court
has
always...
has
examined
as
a
relevant
factor,
whether
alternative
means
of
communication
between...
alternative
ways
of
achieving
the
communication.
in
this
present
situation,
as
to
that
individual
inmate,
if
an
inmate
is
prohibited
from
corresponding
with
another
inmate,
there
will
be
no
alternative
means
of
communicating
with
that
particular
inmate.
however,
there
will
be
alternative
means
of
communication.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
yes.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
we...
as
there
is
evidence
at
the
trial,
we
stopped
it
by
attempting
to
return
the
mail
after
we
identified
that
this
was
a
prison
letter
between
the
civilian
and
the
insider.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
we
would
not
censor
the
letter.
we
return
the
letter.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
we
were
permitted
by
regulations
to
scan
mail
coming
into
our
institutions,
and
we
would
scan
the
mail.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
no,
no
difference
between
scanning
and
looking
at
it.
but
we'd
have
to
look
at
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
we
were...
they
were
circumventing
the
mail
rule.
because
the
whole
point
of
this
was
to
control
the
correspondence
between
inmates.
and
if
we
couldn't
control
that,
then
they
could
always
get
around
us.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
we
would...
we
would
scan
it
whenever
we
felt
there
was
a
problem.
frankly,
the
number
of
letters
coming
in
to
the
institutions
prohibit
us
from
scanning
every
piece
of
mail,
just
as
this
regulation
makes
it
almost
impossible...
makes
it
impossible
for
us
to
scan
all
the
letters
between
the
individual
institutions.
at
the
present
time
we
are
under
a
regulation--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--the
present
case,
under
probable
cause,
yes.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
by
the
regulation.
we
determine
that...
well,
you
mean,
where
do
we
determine
whether
there's
probable
case?
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
all
right.
well,
we
determine
that
by
either
determining
through
the
informant
system
in
the
prison,
determining
whether
something
seemed
irregular
about
the
letter
itself,
from
the
envelope,
determining
whether
or
not
we
have
identified
a
person
as
a
gang
member.
those
kind
of
things
are
the
things
that
we
assess
before
you
would
scan
a
letter
to
determine
whether
or
not
you
need
to
review
it.
at
the
present
time,
we
have
the
right,
as
i
said,
to
examine
the
letters
and
review
the
mail,
but
we
found
that
it's
very
difficult
because
for
every
message
we
catch,
or
every
indication
of
a
problem
we
catch,
we're
concerned
that
we're
missing
some.
for
example,
the
texas
people
indicated
that
they
have
problem
with
codes.
we--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--yes.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
okay,
the
chief--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--his
testimony...
mr.
engelbrecht's
testimony
was
that
25
percent
of
requests
were
approved.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
were
approved.
he
said
that
of
that
number,
or
of
that
group,
he
could
review
those
letters
in
a
period
of
about
an
hour
a
day.
what
we
argue...
and
that
was
used
in
the
circuit
court
opinion,
the
eighth
circuit
court
opinion,
to
say,
well
this
was...
you
could
easily
take
care
of
reviewing
the
mail.
actually,
our
testimony
was
that
we
could
review
this
mail,
but
if
you
permitted
every
inmate
in
the...
in
all
the
institutions
to
correspond,
we
would
find
that
very
difficult
to
handle,
and
in
fact,
we
have
found
some
difficulty
in
it.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
we
could
only
speculate
on
what
it
would
be
at
that
time,
since
we
had
never--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--it
only
tells
you
that
of
the
mail
that
was
approved
by
the...
by
the
individual
team
classification
groups,
that
for
example,
at
renz,
with
a
population
of
350
inmates,
that
it
took
them
about
an
hour
to
approve
the
mail
that
had
been
approved.
now,
not
every
inmate--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--an
hour
everyday.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
no.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
no,
it
doesn't
tell
you.
he
reviewed
it
on
the
basis
of,
you
know,
when
they
found
something
suspicious,
or
they
found
a
letter
that
was
going
to
an
inmate
that
was
not
on
the
approval
list,
he
would
examine
it
to
determine
whether
or
not
it
was...
whether
or
not
there
was--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--the
difficulty
with
our
position
in
the
case
is,
since
we
had
never
permitted
it,
we
didn't
have
an
idea
except
to
say
that...
you
know,
except
that
we
had
8,000
inmates,
and
we
figured
that
they
would
write.
and
that's
the
only
kind
of--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--that's
the
only
think
we
could
speculate
on
at
that
time.
now,
kansas...
sally
halford...
chandler
of
kansas
testified
that
they
had
an
open
correspondence
program,
and
that
they
could
not
review
all
the
mail;
and
they
did
not
review
all
the
mail,
because
they
felt
they
couldn't
handle
it.
and
i
believe
that's
a
fair
assessment
of
her
testimony.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
no.
and
in
dealing
with
an
alternative
means
of
communication,
we
would,
as
i
said,
prohibit--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--it's
too
much
trouble
not
because
we
couldn't
hire
the
people
to
do
it,
because
that's...
you
can
always
hire
more
people.
i
mean,
it
takes
your
resources
away
from
something
else,
but
you
can
hire
more
people.
our
problem
is
that
we
feel
that
the
difficulty
in
reviewing
each
piece
of
mail,
in
light
of
possible
codes,
in
light
of
the
increasing
gang
problem
in
the
state
of
missouri,
would
leave
us
open
to
having
mistakes
being
made
that
would
result
in
tragedy.
in
this
situation,
if
we
catch
a
piece
of
mail,
we
solved
the
problem.
but
every
one
piece
of
mail
we
catch,
we
may
miss
one.
and
if
we
miss
one,
we
have
concerted
activity--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--you'd
have
a
better
chance--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--well,
it's
a
little
bit
different
in
the
sense
that
you
can
begin
to
identify,
by
the
patterns
of
letters
coming
in,
what
letters
are
going
in
to
the
same
inmate
from
the
same
civilian.
for
example,
if
a
civilian
starts
to
write
five
or
six
different
inmates,
you
begin
to
get
the
idea
that
maybe
they're
using
her
as
a
conduit
or
being
used
as
a
conduit.
that
situation
is
slightly
more
specific,
although
a
problem.
i
mean,
we...
this
may
not
be--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--yes,
we
believe
it
be
easier,
because
we
believe
it
be
less...
basically,
most
civilians
won't
get
involved
in
that
kind
of
a
thing.
i
mean,
we're...
we're
basically...
you're
asking
a
civilian
there
to
commit
an
act
in
violation
of...
in
violation
of
a
regulation,
in
violation...
that
could
conceivably
take
away
her
privileges
or
his
privileges
in
dealing
with
the
prison
system
ever
again.
i
mean,
if
you
violate
a
regulation
as
a
civilian,
you
don't
have
a
right
back
in
prison.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
except
it's
so
much
easier
using
the
third...
it's
so
much
easier--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--they're
going
to
have
to
get
a
third
person
involved
in
the
thing,
in
the
scheme.
and
it's
going
to
have
be
a
civilian.
and
there's
an
assumption...
there
would
be
an
assumption
there,
i
would
assume
that
most
civilians
would
not
necessarily
get
involved
in
that
thing;
and
that
if
you
do
have
a
group
of
civilians
who
would
get--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--correct.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
correct.
but
the
system...
the
system
is
not
perfect.
we
cannot
develop
a
perfect
system
without
stopping
all
communication
between
outsiders
and
insiders.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
right,
we're
making
it
as
difficult
as
possible.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
right.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
right.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
and
very
importantly--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--no.
what
we're
also
very
concerned
about
is
the
concerted
action...
for
example,
the
court
in
the
eight
circuit
said,
you're
talking
about
correspondence
that
is
not
as
presumptively
dangerous
as
the
assembly
discussed
in
jones
v.
north
carolina,
or
the
solicitation.
and
they
said,
it
wasn't
as
dangerous
because
you
have
separated
prisons.
our
argument
is
that
it's
more
dangerous
because
we
have
separated
prisons.
the
danger
of
the
assembly
of
inmates
in
jones
versus
north
carolina
was
not
that
they
assembled
but
because
they
could
perform
and
have
concerted
action;
that
they
in
some
way
could
cause
a
disturbance
that
we
could
not
handle.
permitting
inmate-to-inmate
correspondence
between
institutions
permit
them
now
to
have
concerted
action
in
more
than
one
institution.
and
we
would
then
have
to
react,
stretch
our
resources,
into
more
than
one
place.
now,
granted,
we
haven't
had
a
situation
like
that.
but
we
are
predicting,
we
are
attempting
to
anticipate
problems.
if
we
don't
anticipate
problems
in
a
prison
situation,
and
react
to
a
problem
in
a
prison
situation,
we
are
not
going
to
successfully
take
care
of
it.
we
are
going
to
have
tragedy.
and
that's
how
prison
officials...
that's
how
prison
officials
deal
with
it.
if
we
go
to
a
least
restrictive
alternative
analysis--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--yes.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
we
hope
with
our--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--right.
it's
exactly--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--and
hopefully
we
have
chosen
the
people
who
are
going
to
be
the
least
risk.
and
the
difficulty
with
having
free
communication
is
that
basically
we
are
going
to
have
to
deal
with
bad
people
or
people
who
are
dangerous
to
us,
but
people
who
are
going
to
attempt
to
get
around
any
sort
of
inspection.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
when
you
say,
correspondence--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--at
this
time,
the
same...
the
best
interest
standard
was
applied.
now,
certain
institutions
permitted
correspondence
more
regularly.
renz
was
a
minimum
perimeter
prison
with
maximum
security
inmates
and
minimum
security
inmates
in
it,
whereas
the
missouri
state
penitentiary--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--was
the
same.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
right.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
more
restrictively.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
it's
inmates-to-inmates,
it's
prohibited
correspondence
unless...
and
they
meet
three
or
four
different
criteria,
and
i've
forgotten
the
exact
criteria.
but
i
remember
reading
it
last
night,
and
i
just
can't
think
of
the
exact
words.
but
it's
based
on
whether...
there
are
certain
penological
statements
of
benefit
that
would
result
from
the
correspondence
between
the
inmates.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
yes.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
before
you
would
be
the
december
1st,
1983
one,
the
one
that
was
in
effect
at
trial.
that
rule--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--that
was
the
second
one.
i
believe
that
was
the
one
in
front
of
you,
the
one
the
court
struck
down
as
being
overly
restrictive.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
and
i
believe...
and
that
is
my...
after...
i
don't
believe
the
other
one
is
before
you,
because
the
only
issue
there
would
have
been
damages,
that
he
somehow
exceeded
his
authority
and
he
found
no
damages
against
us.
i
mean,
he
found
us
to
have
acted
in
good
faith,
or
at
least
arguably
in
good
faith.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
no.
inmate
marriages--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--i
wasn't
clear
on
that.
although
the
eighth
circuit
found
that
the
evidence
showed
that
it
was
only
used
against
inmates,
its...
its
stretch
was
toward
everybody.
it
could
affect
civilians,
and
would
affect
civilians.
it
was
not
intended
to
not
affect
civilians.
i
don't
think--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--well,
of
course
not.
civilians
who
wanted
to
come
in
marry
inmates.
that
would
be
a
little
beyond
our--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--i
would
say
that...
the
issue
before
the
eighth
circuit
was
inmate-to-inmate
marriages.
but
in
my
brief,
i
point
out
that
it
did
have...
it
could
conceivably...
it
could
have
been
applied
to
civilians.
and
so
i
didn't
want
to
mislead
anybody
on
it.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
yes.
we
were
under
order
to
negotiate
or
submit
separate
rules.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
there
was
an
initial
stay
filed
concerning
when
the
initial
order
came
down.
we
then
negotiated
the
order.
the
court
place--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--right.
we're
working
under
the
new--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--okay.
the
case
isn't
moot
because
given
the
opportunity,
we
would
go
back
to
the
other
rule
if--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--we
put
them
in
under
compulsion,
and
on
the
basis
of
administrative...
well,
there
were
some
tactical
concerns
for
our
administration
of
our
prisons.
because
this
was
our
first
regulation
ever
struck
down.
and
we
were...
we
had
some
administrative
problems
that
we
felt
would
cause
us
to
have
more
difficulty
later
in
the
implementation
than
to
just
appeal
it
and
fight
it.
we
were
under
compulsion.
we
would
go
back
immediately
to
prior
approval.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
we
basically,
unless
the...
we
can...
we
have
a
right
to
counsel
inmates.
the
superintendent
can
counsel
them
not
to
get
married.
but
we
cannot
stop
the
marriage,
unless
the
ceremony
would
in
some
way
interfere
with
the
security
of
the
institution.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
thirty
days...
right,
on
the
ceremony.
on
the
ceremony.
we
couldn't
stop
the
decision
itself.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
right.
the
rule
before
was
that
we
could
actually
stop
a
person
from
getting...
from
making
the
decision
to
get
married.
and
if
i
might,
since
we're
on
the
subject,
i
might
go
into
that
a
little
bit.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
no,
they're
not.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
okay.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
well,
the
court
found
it.
we
contended
that
we
did
have
a
security
reason
for
it.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
we
have
challenged
them
as
clearly
erroneous.
we
believe
it
came
from
a
misconception
of
the
law,
although
this
one
wouldn't
have
come
from
it
because
it
was
a
strict
finding
of
fact.
you're
in
a
difficult
position
when
you
take
findings
of
fact.
i
mean,
he
found
that
we
did
not
do
the
kind
of
inquiry
that
he
expected
us
to
do.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
and
in
fact,
the
testimony
was,
we
did
it.
i
think
the
sticking
point
with
the
district
court
is
that
they
didn't
refer
to
the
file
each
time.
i
mean,
we
explained
that
the
theory
was
that
you
go
to
the
file
and
talk
to
the--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--if
we're
not
required
to
do
that.
now,
we
felt
at
the
district
court
level,
that
that's
what
we
intended
to
do.
and
they
did
it
by
not
necessarily
reference
to
the
file
everytime,
but
they
tried
to
make
a
case-by-case
basis,
because
that's
the
way
the
system
would
work
better.
i
would
agree
that
this
was
an
incorrect...
that
it
was...
we
weren't
required
to
do
that
under
our...
under
constitutional
law
at
this
point.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
could
hurt
the
state
of
missouri?
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
there
is
no
harm
in
marriage
unless
it
affects
a
fundamental
interest,
a
legitimate
penological
interest--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--like
for
example
security.
there
is
evidence--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--okay.
security
in
prison.
you're
dealing
with
a
prison
here.
it's
a
kind
of
unreal
world.
you're
dealing
with
people
who
do
not
develop
relationships;
who
have
had
histories
of
abuse,
especially
in
the
women's
prison;
and
have
had
usually
abusive
situation
with
men.
the
situation
is
that
the
fact
that
they
will
get
married
develops
love
triangles,
develop...
develop
the
sorts
of--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--the
competing...
the
competing
affection...
the
whole
point
that
most
of
these
people
meet,
from,
say
missouri
state
penitentiary
and
at
renz,
which
are
30
miles
distant.
and
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
don't
live
together.
but
somebody
else
can
still
want
to
correspond
with
the
same
woman.
then
we
have
an
extra
problem
over
at
msp
to
keep
these
people
controlled.
or,
for
example,
the
woman
may
change
her
mind.
when
a
woman
would,
for
example,
say
she
was
going
to
marry
one,
decides
she's
going
to
marry
another
man,
we
then
have
a
problem
between
those
two
men.
the
decision
to
get
married
in
this
situation,
granted,
is
a
decision
that's
done
in
the
abstract.
because
all
the
other
instances
of
marriage
are
not
permitted,
or
not
permitted,
but
are
restricted,
really,
by
the
fact
of
incarceration;
the
family
decisions.
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
no.
we
permit
contact
visits.
not
between
inmates,
but
contact
visits
between
civilians
and
inmates.
at
renz,
we
permit
contact
visits.
did
i
answer
your
question?
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
all
right,
let
me
explain
it
this
other
way.
in
zablocki
v.
redhail,
we
had...
the
decision
was
that
you
had...
a
decision
to
be
married
was
an
important
right
and
a
fundamental
right.
and
that
was
because
all
the
other
instances
of
marriage
had
been...
were
permitted,
and
it
seemed...
it
seemed
silly
not
to
permit
the
decision
itself,
or
protect
the
decision
itself.
in
this
situation,
you
have
a
mirror...
the
mirror
image
of
it.
in
this
situation,
we
will...
we
have
to
restrict
by
the
fact
of
incarceration
most
of
he
instances
of
marriage;
and
that
fact
that
they
can't
cohabitate;
the
fact
that
their
decisions
about
marriages
are
changed.
all
we
want
to
restrict
in
the
decision
to
be
married
is,
if
it
affects
our
security
interest
or
if
it
affects
our
rehabilitation
interests.
however,
the
district
court
did
not
accept
our
rehabilitative
interest
in
this.
we
still
believe
that
we
can
have
a
fundamentally
good
impact
on
women
by,
at
times,
restricting
their
decision
to
get
married
in
the
renz
correctional
center.
and
we're
not
dealing
with
the
missouri
state
penitentiary
or
any
other
place.
we're
dealing
with
the
renz
correctional
center,
because
that
was
at
issue,
although
the
regulation
would
have...
systemwide.
but
the
testimony
was
about
mr.
turner's
decisions.
he
felt
that
he
was
assisting
women
to
gain
self-initiative
because
they
were
in
a
particularly
special
condition.
they
were
from
abused
situations.
they
lacked
education
in
most
cases.
and
that
we
acknowledged
that
they
had
had
a
derogatory...
i
mean,
that
they
had
had
a
life
that
was
a
result
of
a
sexist
existence.
and
that
was
what
he
was
attempting
to
recognize,
not
that
he
was
attempting
to
be
sexist
in
his
approach.
now
the
court
found--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--we
would
be
making
the
same...
we
probably
wouldn't...
it's
hard
to
say...
to
decide
whether
or
not
mr.
turner
would
have
said
the
same
thing
about
men.
because
he
might
have
had
men
in
different
situations.
but
women
who
are
in
prison
are
different--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--and
i
tried...
i
hope
i
didn't
make
that
clear...
it
be...
be
the
same,
it's
clear.
and
we
would...
we
would
feel
that
we
could
stop
a
man's
decision
to
be
married
on
the
same
basis,
that
it
affected
the
security
interests,
whether...
in
that
situation,
it
might
be
a
scam.
it
might
be
a
setup
to
set
some
sort
of
a
deal
up
between
them,
even
with
a
civilian,
on
a
drug
scheme
to
get
money
into
the
prison.
and
because
a
woman...
a
married
woman--
mr.
henry
thomas
herschel
--okay,
thank
you
very
much.
