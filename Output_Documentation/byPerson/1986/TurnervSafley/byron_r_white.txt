white
couldn't
we
take
it
as
the
eighth
circuit
construed
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask,
have
your
rules
been
changed
to
conform
to
this
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
there
was
no
stay
or
anything?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
the
rules
now
in
effect
aren't
the
rules
that
were
invalidated?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
the
case
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
operated...
you
put
them
in
under
compulsion?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
there
are
some
applications
of
the
rule
that
would
surely
be
valid.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
vagueness,
for
it
to
be
invalid
for
vagueness
would
require
that
there
are
no
applications
that
you
could
understand.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
are
arguing
that
there
is
a
fundamental
right
of
prisoners
to
correspond
with
one
another?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
martinez
the
closest
case
for
you
or
not?
