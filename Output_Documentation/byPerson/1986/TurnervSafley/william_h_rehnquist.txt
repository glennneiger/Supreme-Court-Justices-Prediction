chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-1384,
william
r.
turner
v.
leonard
safley.
mr.
herschel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
not
two
civilians
who
wanted
to
get
married?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now
that's
the
rule
that
you
put
in
under
compulsion,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
he
asking...
i
read
that
as
requiring
a
case-by-case
inquiry.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
as
a
matter
of
law
you're
not
required
to
make
a
case-by-case
determination
to
apply
those...
this
finding
of
fact
is
meaningless.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
herschel,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
finch.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
court
of
appeals
gave
you
relief,
is
it?
they
said
that
the
regulations
were
bad
on
their
face.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
what's
the
fact
that
he
may
have
violated
his
own
internal
regulations
got
to
do
with
the
issues
that
are
before
us?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
so
you
say
this
case
comes
up
in
a
totally
different
posture
than
identical
regulations
from,
say,
kansas,
because
there
you
might
have
had
an
administrator
who
didn't
violate
his
own
regulations?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
eight
circuit
certainly
didn't
treat
it
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
you're
then
insisting
on
a
case-by-case
and
almost
letter-by-letter
analysis,
which
the
department
says
we
just
don't
have
the
personnel
to
do.
do
our
cases
suggest
that
there
has
be
a
case-by-case
determination
and
a
letter-by-letter?
certainly
the
opinion
in
jones
suggested
you
could
adopt
a
prophylactic
rule
if
you
perceived
a
danger.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
saying
that
it
is
a
fundamental
right
established
by
our
cases
that
prisoners
have
to
correspond
with
other
prisoners?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
don't
think
it
has
either.
well,
then
why...
then
what's
the
basis
for
your
insisting
on
strict
scrutiny?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
the
state
let--
--the
state
is
challenging
the
whole
basis
on
which
the
regulations
were
imposed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
would
think
perhaps
if
they
lose
here,
then
would
be
the
opportunity
to
go
back
to
the
district
court.
but
until
then,
i
would
think
their
basic
approach
is
that
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
were
wrong
in
imposing
the
regulations
they
did.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
finch.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
