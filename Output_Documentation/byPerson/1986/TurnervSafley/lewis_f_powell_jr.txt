justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question
along
the
lines
of
your
argument?
does
the
record
show
that
in
fact
any
mail
was
being
permitted
between
the
inmates?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
it
indicate
the
extent
of
that
mail
that
was
approved?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
it
indicate
whether
there
was
a
dozen
letters
approved
in
a
week,
or
a
dozen
in
a
year?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
were
approved?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
before
you
move
to
that,
i'm
looking
at
some
of
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
district
court.
they're
not
very
favorable
to
you.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
and
they
were
not
found
to
be
clearly
erroneous
by
the
court
of
appeals.
the
one
i
want
to
ask
you
about
is
no.

i
think
i
can...
it's
just
a
couple
of
sentences:
the
renz
rule
against
inmate-to-inmate
correspondence
is
enforced
without
a
determination
that
the
security
or
order
of
renz,
or
the
rehabilitation
of
the
inmates,
would
be
harmed.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
do
you
say
to
that
finding
of
fact?
in
other
words,
the
indication
is
that
the
courts
below
concluded
that
the
rules
were
enforced
without
any
reason
whatever.
