mr.
herschel,
is
the
same
correspondence
rule
applied
in
all
of
missouri's
prisons?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
same
rule
applied
in
all
of
missouri's
prisons
as
in
the
renz
institution?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
general
regulation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--applied
to
all.
it
was
administered
differently--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--at
the
renz
institution;
is
that
it?
more
restrictively?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
know
what
the
federal
correspondence
rule
is
for
inmates-to-inmates?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
the
marriage
rule
now
in
effect?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
have...
you
take
the
position
that
you
can
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
on
any
marriage
ceremony.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
isn't
jones
a
more
appropriate
standard
in
this
case
for
inmate-to-inmate
correspondence,
just
as
it
was
for
inmate-to-inmate
meetings?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
martinez
had
to
do
with
the
rights
of
noninmates,
really.
and
i
wonder
whether
jones
doesn't
provide
the
appropriate
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
court
has
accepted,
of
course,
the
fact
that
a
convicted
felon
can
be
deprived
of
his
liberty,
and
his
opportunity
to
live
with
his
family.
and
these
are
very
fundamental
rights.
and
yet
you
think
the
right
to
correspond
with
another
inmate
is
more
fundamental
than
that,
apparently?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
is
a
remarkable
proposition,
i
think.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
rule
itself
says
that
a
prison...
a
prisoner
may
be
granted
leave
for
inmate-to-inmate
correspondence
if
it's
determined
to
be
in
his
best
interests,
or
hers.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
we're
talking
about
the
validity
of
the
rule
facially.
and
what's
the
matter
with
that
rule,
facially.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
under
your
theory.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
facial
challenge
boils
down
to
a
vagueness
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
which
version
of
the
rule
do
we
have
before
us
on
the
no
marriage?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
is
before
this
court,
do
you
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
there
are
three
different
versions,
and
i'm
not
quite
clear
which
one
we're
addressing.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
the
one
we
have
to
deal
with?
