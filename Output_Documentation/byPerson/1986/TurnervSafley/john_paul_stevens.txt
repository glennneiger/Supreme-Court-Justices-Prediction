mr.
herschel,
does
the
record
tell
us
what
the
volume
of
this
inmate-to-inmate
mail
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
it
tell
us
what...
what
it
has
been
at
any
point
in
time,
attempts
to
mail?
justice
john
paul
stevens
an
hour
everyday?
or
an
hour
a
week?
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
an
hour
everyday.
so
that
must
be...
that
doesn't
tell
us
how
many
letters
there
were--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--whether
they
read
it
closely
or
scan
it
or
what?
justice
john
paul
stevens
one
of
the
things
that
puzzles
me
about
the
case
is,
i
can't
get
a
feel
for
how
much
work
is
really
involved
here.
i
know
in
service
during
the
war
they
could
go
through
an
awful
lot
of
mail
in
a
fairly
brief
period
of
time
when
they
were
looking
for
important
stuff.
but
they
really
don't
know
what
the
volume
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
might
not
be
writing
to
inmates
in
other
institutions,
regularly,
at
least.
i
suppose
they
primarily
write
to
their
family
and
so
forth.
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
her
testimony
tell
us
how
much
there
was
in
kansas?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
other
question.
in
your
principal
argument,
why
you
must
just
say,
no
mail,
unless
you
get
advance
permission,
is,
it'd
be
too
much
trouble
to
review
the
volume
that
would
take
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
have
precisely
the
same
risk
that
justice
marshall
identified,
don't
you,
in
the
mail...
sending
it
to
a
civilian
who
in
turn
would
pass
the
same
message
along
to
the
inmate
in
the
other
institution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
only
way
to
catch
that
is
to
go
through
all
mail,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
that's
easier
to
handle
than
just
looking
at
the
direct
inmate
correspondence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
most
of
your
danger
of
some
kind
of
illegal
activity
between
an
inmate...
two
inmates,
one
in
one
institution
and
one
in
another,
planning
some
kind
of
escape
or
something,
wouldn't
they
almost
always
have
to
use
a
third
party
to
help
them
with
their
plans?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
there's
a
third
party
involved,
they
just
write
to
the
third
party,
who
in
turns
writes
to
them.
i
mean,
i
just...
i
have
trouble--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--yes,
but
if
you
have
a
potential
escape
with
a
third
person
civilian,
obviously,
this
is
not
an
honorable
civilian.
justice
john
paul
stevens
by
hypothesis.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you,
then,
do
not
contend
that
the
constitution
restricts
the
warden
to...
the
only
permissible
way
to
do
it
would
be
item-by-item
censoring
of
the
mail.
you
would
agree,
i
take
it,
from
your
most
recent
argument,
that
if
they
identify
gang
members
and
disperse
them
among
different
institutions
because
they
represent
a
threat,
they
could
ban
all
mail
between
those
people
without
bothering
to
look
at
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
they
have
some
reasonable
basis
for
identifying
a
person
as
a
particularly
dangerous
inmate,
they
can
say,
nobody
can
correspond
with
him
if
he's
in
a
different
institution?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
would
you
agree
that
the
prison...
the
warden
would
have
a
fairly
broad
discretion
in
deciding
who
belongs
in
the
7
percent
class
as
opposed
to
the
93
percent
class?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
reason,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
do
you
think
you
have
to
wait
until
you
find
something
in
the
mail?
or
what
about...
say
you
have
a
gang
form
in
institution
a,
and
they
decide
to
disperse
them
to
five
different
institutions,
just
for
general
security
reasons,
but
they've
never
gotten
any
correspondence.
could
they
right
away
impose
a
ban
on
those
people
writing
to
one
another?
