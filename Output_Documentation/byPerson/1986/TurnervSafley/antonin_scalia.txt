you
can
make
it
harder,
is
what
you're
saying,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
stop
it
entirely,
but
you
can
make
it
harder.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
they
have
to...
and
moreover,
it
isn't
just
escape
you're
worried
about,
is
it?
you're
also
worried
about
prison
gangs.
justice
antonin
scalia
assassinations
in
one
prison
being
directed
from
another.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
doesn't
require
a
civilian
at
all,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
mail
rules
aren't
just
intended
to
decrease
the
volume.
they
do
decrease
the
volume
of
mail
that
you
have
to
review--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
they
also
decrease
what
you
might
say
the
risk
of
the
mail
that
has
to
be
reviewed.
that
is,
even
though
it
may
only
be
25
percent,
the
amount
of
mail,
it's
much
less
than
25
percent
the
amount
of
attention
the
amount
of
attention
you
have
to
devote
to
that
mail,
isn't
that
so,
because
it's
not
coming
from
the
most
dangerous
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
the
objective
of
the
system,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
isn't
just
a
reduction
in
volume.
it
also
makes
it
easier
for
you
to
review
what
reduced
volume
is
produced?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
content
of
that
rule?
you
described
that
rule
in
your
opening
remarks
as
one
that
prevented
marriages
between
inmates...
inmates.
is
that
its
limitation,
or
does
it--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
that
important?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
the
rules
are
good
or
bad.
it's
a
different
case
if
you're
bringing
a
suit
about
their
abuse
of
discretion.
it
seems
to
me
the
rules
are
good
or
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
see
what
relevance
it
has
that
this...
that
they
may
have
abused
discretion
in
the
past.
i
thought
it
was
common
practice
to
place
conditions
upon
parolees,
for
example,
that
they
not
maintain
contact
with
other
convicted
felons
during
the
term
of
their
parole.
is
that
not
a
fairly
common
condition
upon
parole?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now,
if
that
can
be
placed
on
a
parolee,
why
is
correspondence
with
other
convicted
criminals
while
he's
in
the
prison
so
clearly
a
violation
of
a
fundamental
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
would
agree,
then,
that
agreeing
with
you
on
this
would
cast
doubt
on
the
validity
of
restrictions
upon
parolees
being
in
contact
with
convicted
felons?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
there's
no
such
thing
as
good
or
bad
regulations
in
and
of
themselves.
you
really
have
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
but
what
if
the
state
agrees
to
replace
the
administrator?
do
we
know
that
they're
going
to
have
the
same
administrator?
justice
antonin
scalia
did...
was
the
lower
court's
determination
limited
to
this
rule
as
applied
by
this
administrator?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
it
say
that
the
state
could
adopt
the
rules
as
long
as
it
put
in
a
new
administrator,
or
when
it
got
a
new
administrator?
justice
antonin
scalia
then,
evidently,
it
didn't
rule
what
you
said
it
ruled.
the
administrator
seems
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
its
decision.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
finch,
i
still
don't
understand
how
this
argument
goes
to
whether
the
rule
is
valid.
what
you're
telling
me
was
that
the
rule
was
not
being
applied
fairly.
it
was
not
being
applied
in
such
a
way
that
you
are
allowed
to
correspond,
as
the
rule
said
you
would
and
as
we've
been
told
was
the
purpose,
as
long
as
there
was
no
security
problem.
but
that
means
that
the
administration
of
it
was
bad.
and
as
i
read
the
opinion
that
we're
reviewing
here,
it
says
the
rule
is
bad,
even
if
it
were
honestly
applied.
and
isn't
that
what
you're
arguing,
that
the
rule
is
bad?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
doesn't
just
relate
to
the
letter.
as
we've
been
told,
it
may
relate
to
the
inmate
from
whom
it
came.
maybe
he
was
a
troublemaker.
i
mean,
what
the
prison
is
trying
to
do
is
to
say,
we
don't
want
to
have
to
review
all
of
this
mail
so
intensively.
so
we
just...
we
can't
possibly
catch
all
of
the
things
that
might
be
in
it.
so
we're
simply
going
to
eliminate
the
correspondence
between
bad
actors.
now,
for
all
we
know,
the
examples
you
give,
although
the
particular
letter
was
quite
harmless,
that
letter
may
have
come
from
a
very
bad
actor,
from
a
gang
head
in
another
prison.
isn't
that
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
finch,
what
if
this
were
not
just
a
prison
rule,
but
what
if
it
was
a
statute
enacted
by
the
legislature
that
said,
we're
adding
to
all
the
punishments
that
we
now
have
on
the
books
in
addition
to
twenty
years
or
whatnot,
anyone
who's
convicted
of
a
crime
will
not
be
able
to
correspond
with
other
inmates
of
penal
institutions?
i
mean,
avowedly
making
it
part
of
the
punishment.
would
that
be
bad?
is
there
any
difference
between
that
and
this
situation?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
take
a
man
out
of
his
home,
out
of
his
family,
prevent
him
from
contact
visits
with
his
family,
even,
all
of
the
other
fundamental
liberties
can
be
taken
away
as
a
punishment
for
crime,
but
the
ability
to
correspond
with
other
felons
who
are
in
prison
is
so
fundamental
that
that
can't
be
imposed?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
seems
very
strange.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
your
problem
with
this
one
is
not
that
it's
vague,
or
is
it?
your
attack
on
this
is
a
bit
different
from
your
attack
on
the
other
one,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
compelling
reason
is
less
vague,
certainly,
than
the
conditions
for
allowing
prison
mail,
which
were
unspecified.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
might
ask
the
nine
of
us
what
constitutes
a
least
onerous
alternative,
and
we
might
all
come
up
with
different
answers
to
that.
but
it's
a
standard,
anyway,
just
as
compelling
reason
is
a
standard.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
finch,
is
it
clear...
you
know,
we've
said
that
the
right
to
get
married
is
a
fundamental
right.
but
the
ordinary
marriage
has
a
lot
of
attributes
to
it
that
this
marriage
here
would
not.
i
mean,
what
is
left
of
the
associations
of
marriage?
not
the
right
to
cohabit.
not
the
right
to
beget
and
rear
children
in
the
prison
context,
right?
so
it's
basically
just
a
demonstration
of
commitment
to
someone,
which
might
be
made
in
other
ways,
right?
and
i
suppose
there
are
inheritance
effects
if
the
two
people
get
married.
what
other...
what
other
attributes
of
the
normal
marital
relation
continue
to
exist
in
the
prison
context?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
don't.
i
mean,
in
fact,
they
don't
share
their
life
with
one
another.
they
still
live
apart.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
couldn't
they
make
that
commitment
just
as
well
by
sending
them
a
fraternity
ring?
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
the
prison
stop
them
from
getting
engaged?
