mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
what
we
have
in
this
case
today
involves
the
prison's
denial
of
a
recognized
fundamental
right
that
at
least
applies
to
the
free
world
which
is
not
inconsistent
with
incarceration.
both
marriage
and
correspondence
were
denied
at
renz
correctional
center
under
a
vague,
best
interests
standard.
if
the
court
reverses
this
case
outright,
then
effectively
what
happens
is
that
mr.
turner
and
the
officials
at
renz
correctional
center,
who
arrogate
to
themselves
the
right
to
decide
which
of
their
charges
will
be
married,
and
who
can
write
letters
to
each
other,
will
effectively
have
no
review,
no
judicial
review,
of
their
conduct.
they
will
be
effectively
the
final
arbiters
of
these
important
decisions
that
are
well
recognized
in
the
jurisprudence
of
this
country.
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
we
have
here
a
prison
administration
at
renz
with
a
history
of
abuse
of
the
discretion
that
it's
been
given.
as
the
court
below
pointed
out--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--because,
justice
scalia,
in
this
particular
case
we
have
one
institution
that
was
violating
the
department-wide
rules.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
in
fact,
your
honor--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
think
that
is.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
know,
i'm
not
aware,
of
any
supreme
court
case
recognizing
that
as
an
appropriate
decision
that
will
stand
up.
so
this
is
the
first
time
that
this
court
will
have
an
opportunity
to
rule
on
the
decisions
of
two
persons
to
remain
in
contact,
either
inmates
or
parolees.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir.
to
answer
your
earlier
question,
sir,
about
why
the
facts
of
this
particular
case
are
important,
we
had
here
a
prison
administrator
who
was
violating
the
rules
of
the
department
of
corrections.
he
had
his
own
little
fiefdom.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
the
state
is
arguing
that
the
entire
findings
of
fact
of
the
district
court
should
be
thrown
out
because
the
prison
administrator
should
have
discretion.
and
the
chief
justice's
question
about
whether
the
factual
findings
of
the
court
below
are
even
relevant,
i'd
point
out
that
what
happened,
and
the
ability
of
this
particular
prison
administrator
to
exercise
his
discretion,
is
relevant
to
the
decision
of
this
court.
if
you've
got
somebody
who's
violating
his
own
rules,
who
in
this
case
actually
was
violating
the
procunier
v.
martinez
case
by
stopping
the
correspondence
of
inmates
with
outsiders,
totally
innocent
correspondence,
then
you've
got
someone
who
i
contend
cannot
be
trusted
to
enforce
the
rules
fairly.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
it
was
argued
that...
those
points
were
argued
to
them
as
well,
sir.
you
see,
there
was
a
finding...
excuse
me,
there
was
a
conclusion
of
law
by
the
court
below
that
the
regulations
were
arbitrarily
and
capriciously
applied
here,
and
that
finding
was
not
appealed.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
no,
sir,
i'm
not...
i'm
sorry,
sir,
i'm
not
arguing
that
at
all.
what
i
am
arguing
is
that
when
you
look
at
the
application
of
the
rules
in
this
case,
it's
a
reason
not
to
trust
this
administrator
with
that
much
discretion.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
no,
we
don't.
and
we
don't
know
that
we're
going
to
have
the
same
problem.
justice
scalia--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
was
not.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
focussed
on
the
rule
itself.
but
my
only
point
was
that
the
district
court
also
had
a
separate
finding,
a
conclusion
of
law,
which
was
not
appealed
that
this
particular
administrator
acted
arbitrarily.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
in
response
to
questions,
justice
marshall.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
i
made
a
mistake
then.
in
this
particular
case,
we
found
that
there
was
very
little
evidence
to
support
the
arguments
of
the
state
of
missouri.
in
regard
to
correspondence,
for
example,
there
was
a
contention
made
that
we
promulgated
this
rule
because
of
security.
but
in
fact
the
evidence
at
trial
was
that
none
of
the
letters
which
were
stopped
were
stopped
for
a
reason
having
anything
to
do
with
security.
in
fact,
when
inmates
asked
to
correspond,
there
was
no
discussion,
no
going
back
and
reviewing
the
file
about
whether
or
not
this
particular
inmate
might
pose
a
threat
to
the
inmate
he's
corresponding
with
or
someone
else.
the
flat
rule
that
was
stated
in
the
renz
correctional
center
handbook
is:
inmates
may
not
correspond
with
anybody
who
is
not
a
family
member.
so
we
had
in
this
case
a
flat
denial
of
correspondence
between
particular
inmates
who
had
no
desire
to
correspond
about
anything
other
than
simple
friendship.
in
fact,
justice
marshall,
your
point
was
well
taken
about
the
state's
concession,
that
there
was
no
alternative
means
of
communication
between
these
inmates.
that,
in
fact,
was
the
case.
if
an
inmate
wanted
to
write
to
a
friend
he
knew
on
the
outside,
for
example,
at
renz,
the
rule
as
applied
would
not
let
that
inmate
correspond.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes
sir,
i
am,
because
you
give
too
much...
you
give
too
much
vagueness
when
you
put
in
a
standard
of
best
interests.
there
is
no
standard
to
guide
the
prison
administrator.
they
have
other
rules
which
allow
the
prison
administration
to
stop
correspondence
which,
say,
is
writing
about
escape
attempts
or
a
fraud
of
some
kind.
all
of
those
things
are
covered.
but
the
vague
best
interests
standard
allows
the
prison
administrator
to
do
anything
he
darn
well
pleases
in
regard
to
the
correspondence
of
inmates.
and
we
had
testimony--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--your
honor--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--well,
justice
white,
if
there
is
a
circumstance
where
you
could
stop...
validly
stop
two
inmates
from
writing
because
of
their
best
interest,
there's
no
evidence
of
it
in
the
record
below.
none
of
the
letters
that
were
stopped
had
anything
having
to
do
with
security
or
an
escape
attempt.
and
we
reproduce
some
of
them
in
the
brief.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
justice
scalia,
i'm
afraid
there's
no
evidence
of
that
in
the
record
of
this
case.
the
state
never
presented
testimony
that
the
particular
correspondent
was
a
member
of
a
gang
or
had
any
reason
to
cause
any
harm
to
the
security
of
either
institution.
these
were
simply
letters
of
friendship,
many
of
them
simply
love
letters
between
a
female
inmate
at
renz
and
a
male
inmate
someplace
else.
and
i
stress,
this
is
the
only
institution
where
you
have
this
problem.
if
a
male
inmate
at
the
missouri
state
prison
wanted
to
write
to
a
male
inmate
at
moberly,
that
sort
of
correspondence
was
routinely
allowed.
now,
perhaps
the
state
could
impose
restrictions
on
gang
members.
but
the
department
of
justice
study
which
was
cited
in
the
briefs
in
this
case
points
out
that
97...
93
percent
of
the
missouri
inmates
are
not
members
of
gangs.
so
the
effect
of
this
rule
is,
you
stop
most
of
the
prisoners
in
missouri
who
don't
cause
any
problems
from
corresponding,
because
you
don't
want
to
read
their
mail,
because
some
of
them
might
be
gang
members.
and
i
would
suggest
that
if
the
state's
been
able
to
quantify
that
7...
i
believe
it's
6.7
percent
of
their
members
are
gang
members,
they
must
know
pretty
well
who
they
are,
and
they
can
limit
their
correspondence.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
your
honor--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--yes,
justice
stevens,
to
put
it
in
the
terms
of
the
court,
of
the
strict
scrutiny
test,
i
think
the
state
would
have
a
compelling
state
interest,
and
there
may
be
no
least
restrictive
alternative
way
of
stopping
the
correspondence
which
may
be
harmful
between
the
prison...
the
gang
member
at
msp
and
the
gang
member
at
moberly.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
i
think
you're
going--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--there
has
to
be
some
kind
of
reason.
and
frankly,
your
honor,
i
suggest
the
best
reason
is
an
example
of
conduct
that
you
don't
want
to
have
occurring
in
the
mail,
an
instruction
or
perhaps...
an
instruction
to
kill
an
inmate,
or
perhaps
even
just
an
instruction...
the
use
of
a
code
by
one
inmate.
this
court
recognizes--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--i
think
they
could,
justice
stevens.
and
then
the
question
would
be,
what
if
an
inmate
at
msp
wants
to
write
to
someone
else,
and
he
wants
to
write
a
totally
innocent
letter?
i
think
under
those
circumstances,
if
the
prison
administrator
can
read
the
letter
and
say,
gee,
we
don't
see
anything
here
that's
wrong
with
this
letter,
then
that
inmate
should
be
allowed
to
send
it
to
someone
who's
not
a
gang
member.
but
the
rule
you
suggest,
allowing
all
correspondence
to
be
denied
for
particular
inmates,
would
still
suffer
from
that
vice.
and
perhaps
the
inmate's
got
a
cousin
who
would
not
fit
within
the
missouri
rules
as
to
who
is
an
immediate
family
member,
and
he'd
like
to
write
to
his
cousin
about
his
sister's
birth
of
a
child.
there's
no
reason
that
that
letter
should
be
stopped,
merely
because
of
the
speculation
that
on
some
other
occasions,
this
same
inmate
might
write
something
that
would
harm
the
security
of
the
institution.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
mr.
chief
justice,
but
the
opinion
in
jones
also
recognized
that
inmates
do
retain
those
certain
fundamental
rights.
and
if
you
adopt
a
prophylactic
rule
that
says,
none
of
the
residents
of
msp
are
going
to
be
allowed
to
correspond
with
anyone
else,
in
the
absence
of
any
evidence
that
any
resident
of
renz
correctional
center
is
a
member
of
a
gang,
then
you're
violating
everybody's
rights,
because--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--no,
sir,
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
reached
that.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
because,
justice
white,
i
believe
that
the
fundamental
right
should
be
recognized
in
this
case,
that
prison
authorities--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--yes,
that's
what
i
think
the
court
should
adopt
in
this
case,
that
there
are
certain
core
rights,
such
as
the
right
of
a
written
word--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
it
is;
martinez
is
clearly
the
closest.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
there
are...
there
is
some--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--that
is
the
state's
argument,
justice
o'connor.
but
in
jones,
there
was
a
specific
discussion
of
the
first
amendment
rights
to
inmates
to
solicit
one
another
for
membership
in
a
prison.
and
what
this
court
said
was,
we're
not
going...
we
don't
have...
the
state...
excuse
me,
the
prison
officials
do
not
have
to
allow
mass
mailings.
but
the
court
recognized
that's
because
there
can
still
be
individual
mailings.
that
channel
of
communication
is
not
cut
off.
and
we
view
that
as
authority
for
the
position
we're
arguing
in
this
case.
when
leonard
safley,
one
of
the
named
plaintiffs,
wanted
to
write
a
letter
to
his
fiancee,
p.j.
watson,
it
didn't
do
any
good
to
tell
him
he
might
be
able
to
write
to
somebody
else,
because
he
had
a
particular
target
of
that
correspondence.
and
jones
recognizes
that
that
existence
of
no
other
alternative
is
what's
important.
the
court
did
use
a
least
restrictive
analysis
in
jones
as
regards
to
the
first
amendment
issue.
and
i'd
also
point
out
that
the
court
said,
first
amendment
rights
are
barely
at
issue
in
this
case.
well,
back
in
pell,
this
court
held
that
the
inmates
do
have
some
first
amendment
rights
which
are
not
inconsistent
with
incarceration.
and
the
state's
conceded
that
they
let
at
least
25
percent
of
the
inmates
write.
so
it's
clear
that
the
mere
fact
of
correspondence
is
not
inconsistent
with
incarceration.
it's
what
in
the
letter
itself.
and
the
only
way
you
determine
what's
in
the
letter
is
by
reading
it.
i
would
suggest
that
there's
no
real
evidence
that
the
state
of
missouri
can't
handle
whatever
security
problems
that
it
thinks
may
exist.
after
all,
these
rules
have
been
in
effect
for
30
months.
there's
been
no
effort
to
go
back
to
the
district
court
in
this
case
and
say,
judge
sacks,
we
can't
handle
this
problem.
we
can't
deal
with
the
security
concerns.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
that's
right,
chief
justice...
mr.
chief
justice.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
and
in
fact,
perhaps
they
may
do
it
at
that
point,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
the
problem
is,
at
the
present
time,
they
have
not
encountered
such
a
serious
problem
that
they
did
go
back
and
try
to
get
a
change
of
the
rule
in
the
district
court.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir.
many
people
have
been
married.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
i
don't
know.
at
least
ten
that
i
am
aware
of.
but
i
have
not
tried
to
keep
track
of
all
the
marriages
that
have
occurred
in
missouri
prisons.
now--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--well,
certainly
there's
a
difference,
in
that
you've
got
a
legislative
enactment
and
not
simply
a
particular
prison
administrator
at
one
point.
but,
judge,
i...
excuse
me,
justice
scalia,
i
don't
think
there's
any
substantive
difference.
i
would
argue
that
that
statute
would
also
be
unconstitutional,
because
of
what
i
believe
is
an
inmate's
right--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
would
say--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--there
are
certain
things,
such
as
communication,
the
ability
to
keep
open
lines,
the
ability
to
practice
one's
central
religious
beliefs,
is
something
that
could
not
be
taken
away
by
state
statute.
and
the
ability
of
a
person
to
marry
the
person
of
his
choice
also
should
not
be
taken
away
by
state
statute.
so
long
as
this
court
recognizes
in
its
opinions
that
inmates
retain
certain
rights,
then
the
question
becomes,
what
rights
are
they
and
how
can
they
be
protected?
if
the
court
were
to
simply
say
as
a
final
matter,
well,
inmates
have
no
rights
and,
in
this
case,
they
have
no
correspondence
rights,
they
have
no
marriage
rights,
and
in
the
shabazz
case
that's
coming
up
before
this
court,
they
have
no
religious
rights,
then
we
can
all
go
home,
and
there
won't
be
nearly
as
much
prison
litigation.
but
of
course
the
court
has
never
accepted
such
a
broad
proposition.
what
we
have--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--i
guess
i'll
have
to
answer
yes.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
the
prison
system
of
this
country
recognizes
the
importance
of
this
communication
for
rehabilitation
of
an
inmate.
the
regulations
that
were
in
effect
in
this
case,
in
their
preamble
clauses,
always
said
that
communication
is
important
because
it
gives
the
inmate
something
to
look
forward
to.
as
i
mentioned,
many
of
these
letters--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--yes,
that's
right.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
because
it
is
unduly
vague.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
ma'am,
under
my...
excuse
me,
justice
o'connor,
under
my
theory,
it's
wrong
because
it
gives
too
much
discretion
to
prison
authorities
to
deny
a
letter
solely
because
they
don't
like
the
content.
and
in
fact,
there
was
one
letter
which
was
stopped
because
the
prison
administrators
did
not
like
the
content
of
what
was
said.
there
was
other
correspondence
that
was
stopped
because
a
former
inmate
who'd
been
released
from
prison
was
a
quote
writ
writer,
unquote,
and
the
prison
authorities
didn't
want
her
writing
back
in
to
her
inmates.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir...
excuse
me,
yes,
ma'am.
i
apologize.
the
other
issue,
of
course,
in
this
case
is
the
right
of
prison
officials
to
stop
inmates
from
marrying
one
another.
the
state
has
correctly
pointed
out
that
there
are
inmates
under
the
prior
rule
and
under
the
current...
well,
i
guess
there
have
been
three
rules
in
effect.
the
first
rule
was
a
rule
that
said
inmates...
basically
said
inmates
can
get
married
as
soon
as
the
prison
officials
work
out
the
arrangements.
now,
ironically,
in
this
particular
case,
justice...
excuse
me,
superintendent
turner
took
it
upon
himself
to
stop
inmates,
even
though
there
was
a
rule
that
allowed
inmates
to
be
married.
he
stopped
certain
inmates
from
getting
married,
because
in
his
opinion
the
marriage
was
not
a
good
idea.
then
about
a
month
before
the
trial
was
scheduled,
and
three
months
before
the
trial
actually
occurred,
they...
the
state
of
missouri
set
up
a
new
system
where
an
inmate
had
to
come
up
with
some
compelling
reason
for
allowing
him
to
get
married.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
the
current
rule--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--the
last--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--justice
o'connor,
the
last
rule
before
the
court...
before
the
trial
was
a
rule
that
said,
an
inmate
can
only
be
married
if
he
comes
up
with
a
compelling
reason
that
the
marriage
should
be
allowed.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
the
rule
that
was
written
by
the
missouri
division
of
corrections
after
the
case
went
to
trial
and
the
judgment
was
rendered,
allows
inmates
to
be
married
basically
at
the
convenience
of
the
prison
administration.
they
file
a
request,
and
they
are
allowed
to
be
married
when
it
is
convenient,
and
under
certain
restrictions,
restrictions
as
to
the
number
of
inmates
who
may
attend,
the
visitors,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
it
is
vague--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
i
would
agree
that
it
is
vague.
i
do
no
suggest
that
it
is...
that
there
is
a
common
method
of
understanding.
we
asked
the
various
prison
administrators
who
testified
what
their
definition
was,
and
they
did
not
come
down
to
exactly
the
same
thing.
for
example,
a
defendant
blackwell
testified
that
financial
considerations
would
be
good
enough
to
allow
two
inmates
to
get
married.
but
superintendent...
or
warden
wirick
testified
that
the
only
reason
he'd
allow
two
people
to
get
married
is
if
they
already
had
an
illegitimate
child
and
to
give
the
baby
a
name.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is.
and
i
return
to
the
proposition
that
i
don't
think
that
prison
authorities
should
have
the
power,
in
the
absence
of
some
compelling
reason
that
they
advance,
in
the
absence
of
showing
there's
no
other
way
around
the
problem,
a
least
restrictive
alternatives
analysis,
to
stop
two
consenting
adults,
who
satisfy
the
statutes
of
missouri,
from
getting
married.
justice
powell
pointed
out
earlier
that
the
findings
of
fact
in
this
case,
particularly
findings
of
fact
no.
7,
do
not
support
the
argument
of
the
state
in
this
case,
and
that
is
a
matter
which
i
would
like
to
deal
with.
as
you
pointed
out,
sir,
the
district
court
heard
testimony
over
five
days
from
30-some
different
witnesses,
and
had
the
opportunity
to
listen
to
mr.
turner
explain
why
he
denied
marriages;
had
the
opportunity
to
hear
defendant
engelbrecht
testify
about
the
way
he
handled
correspondence.
and
under
those
circumstances,
his
findings
of
fact
are
entitled
to
great
weight.
those
were
then
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals.
and
the
state,
even
though
it's
just
arguing
in
its
brief,
still
contends
that
this
court
should
go
back
and
reverse
all
the
findings
of
fact
by
the
trial
court,
and
presumably
enter
its
own
findings
at
this
level.
i
would
suggest
that
the
findings
of
fact
are
entitled
to
particular
deference
in
this
case.
when
we
had
defendant
turner
on
the
stand
in
the
court
itself
to
cross-examine
this
man
about
why
he
was
denying
marriage
and
the
standards
used
for
denying
correspondence.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
justice
scalia,
if
you
asked
the
inmates
here
why
they
want
to
get
married,
they
give,
in
my
opinion,
a
compelling
response.
because
they
want
to
share
their
life
with
someone,
even
if
it's
only
by
mail.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
well,
for
one
thing,
your
honor--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--i
don't
think
that
the
religious
attributes
of
a
marriage
ceremony
can
be
fairly
equated
with
a
fraternity
ring.
it
seems
to
me,
sir,
that
we
must
also
recall
that
these
inmates
are
not,
in
most
cases,
at
least,
in
prison
for
life.
leonard
safley,
one
of
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case,
was
in
the
kansas
city
honor
center,
and
had
the
opportunity
to
come
down
and
visit
his
wife
in
renz
correctional
center,
and
he
did
that
on
a
regular
basis.
now,
admittedly,
their
marriage
at
that
time
may
have
been
limited
to
letters,
sitting
together
in
the
visiting
room,
and
holding
hands
and
an
occasional
kiss
when
the
guard
wasn't
looking,
but
that
does
not
mean
that
that
marriage
was
any
less
important
or
sacred.
there
are
many
people
who
marry,
perhaps
in
their
60's
or
70's,
who
may
not
have
a
sexual
relationship,
but
still
have
care
for
the
person
that
they've
chosen
to
spend
the
rest
of
their
life
with.
and
it
may
be,
as
the
district
court
recognized,
that
these
marriages
may
not
all
work
out.
but
that
fact
is
constitutionally
irrelevant,
i
would
submit.
because
free
people
make
mistakes,
and
inmates
make
mistakes,
as
the
state
points
out,
or
they
wouldn't
be
in
there.
but
at
least
they've
got
a
right
to
try
to
make
a
better
life
for
themselves.
we
had
expert
testimony
that
the
important
thing
about
the
marriage
decision
is
that
the
inmate
is
standing
up
and
saying,
hey,
while
i
may
be
incarcerated,
i've
got
a
right
to
look
forward
to
a
better
life.
i've
got
a
right
to
plan
on
something
after
this
institution.
and
the
evidence
we
had
in
this
case
is
that
the
inmates
who
did
get
married,
despite
the
prison
officials'
objections,
ended
up
becoming
better
prisoners.
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge,
there
was
not
something
like
that.
although,
justice
scalia,
there
was
something
like
that
that
happened
at
renz,
where
both
men
and
women
prisoners
were
located.
as
soon
as
prison
administrators
noticed
any
sort
of
friendship
more
serious
than
very
platonic,
they
would
immediately
move
the
man
to
another
institution.
so
they
were
trying
to
break
up
any
relationship
from
developing
between
inmates
of
the
two
sexes
at
that
particular
institution.
so
yes,
if...
there
was
no
allowance
of
allowing
two
inmates
at
renz
to
get
engaged.
in
fact,
leonard
safley
in
this
case,
as
soon
as
the
prison
administrators
became
aware
that
there
was
a
friendship
between
he
and
his
ultimate
fiancee,
they
moved
him
to
another
institution.
even
when
he
was
gone,
however,
they
wouldn't
let
the
two
inmates
correspond.
and
so
mr.
safley
didn't
now
until
he
came
to
judge
sacks'
courtroom
about...
in
1982...
whether
she
would
actually
consent
to
marry
him.
and
that's
when,
in
the
courtroom,
is
when
we
found
out
her
answer.
i
think
that
the
prison
administration
in
the
state
of
missouri
can
balance
the
interests
of
the
inmates
in
correspondence
and
marriage
with
their
own
security
needs.
as
i've
suggested,
they
have
been
able
to
do
so.
all
it
takes
is
a
little
prodding
from
the
courts.
but
if
this
court
takes
away
that
prodding
by
granting
too
much
deference
to
prison
administrators,
then
we're
going
to
have
a
series
of
cases,
i
would
suggest,
around
the
country
where--
mr.
floyd
r.
finch,
jr.
--thank
you,
sir.
