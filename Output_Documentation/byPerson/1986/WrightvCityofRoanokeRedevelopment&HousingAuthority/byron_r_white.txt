justice
byron
r.
white
where
there
is
a
state
involved.
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
the
class
of
cases
that
1983
applies
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
it's
only
if
there
is
some
identifiable
federal
legal
right
involved?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
opponent
certainly
challenges
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
your
opponent
thinks
that
the
right
ought
to
appear
in
the
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you
have
to
rely
on
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
you
have
to
rely
on
the
regulations?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
regulation
was
consistent
with
the
statute,
it
had
the
force
of
law,
didn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
there
been
any
claim
that
the
regulation
is
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
i
suppose
you
would,
or
do
you...
if
you
say
that
the
statute
itself
requires
the
inclusion
of
utilities,
hud
would
not
be
free
to
say
that
it
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
don't
think,
you
don't
think
hud
would
have
the
authority
to
take
a
contrary
position
under
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
it
isn't
fatal
to
your
case,
i
don't
suppose,
for
you
to
answer
the
way,
if
you
answered
the
other
way
and
said
that
hud
could
interpret
the
statute
either
way.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
think
a
contrary
regulation
would
very
well
be
invalid?
justice
byron
r.
white
has
hud
taken
a
position
whether
or
not
1983
is
available
to
your
client?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
say
that
they
don't
have
much
authority
themselves
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
hence,
the
congress
could
never
have
intended
their
regime
to
displace
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
but
if
hud
has
that
limited
an
authority,
you
would
say
therefore
congress
couldn't
have
intended
to
preempt
1983?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
state
was
obligated
to
follow
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
answer
is
yes,
you
were
obligated
to
follow
the
regulation
and
you
did?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
you're
following
the
regulation?
you
are
bound
to
follow
the
regulation?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
regulation
is
consistent
with
the
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
has
the
force
of
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
justice
byron
r.
white
part
of
your
argument,
as
i
understand
your
brief,
is
that
the
state
has
never
understood
its
obligation
under
the
contract
or
under
the
law
or
under
the
regulations
to
make
it
liable
to
cover
utilities.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you've
never
understood
your
obligation
to
be
any
more
than
what
you
say
it
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
you
in
effect
say
there
really
isn't
any
clearly
enough
expressed
right
under
the
statute
or
regulations
to
found
a
1983
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
there
was
either
a
provision
of
the
statute
or
the
regulation
that
was
perfectly
clear
and
the
housing
authority
had
just
been
ignoring
it.
just
suppose
that.
i
know
you
have
an
argument
that
there
are
utilities
and
then
there
are
utilities.
but
let's
just
suppose
that
it
was
perfectly
clear.
do
you
suppose
a
1983
action
would
be
available
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
maine
against
thiboutot?
wasn't
there
a
holding
that
1983
is
available
to
enforce
statutory
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
would
suppose
you'd
make
the
same
argument
in
any
of
these
spending
power
grant
programs.
justice
byron
r.
white
straighten
up.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
way
to
invoke
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
thought
you
said
you
could
sue
them.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
now
you've
answered
the
question
three
ways.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
haven't
given
it
back.
