mr.
henry
l.
woodward
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioning
public
housing
tenants
in
this
case
and
the
roanoke
housing
authority
agree
on
one
critical
point
of
the
case:
where
a
section
1983
plaintiff
has
a
substantive
right
under
federal
law,
we
are
in
agreement
that
there
arises
a
presumption
that
congress
intended
for
a
private
enforcement
action
to
be
possible
rather
than
precluded.
the
major
issue
before
the
court
is
how
that
presumption
operates.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
we
believe
that
it
is,
your
honor.
it
has
some
elements
in
common,
but
i
believe
that
the
experience
of
the
fourth
circuit
in
trying
to
address
the
preclusion
inquiry
here
shows
that
the
traditional
cort
versus
ash
four-step
approach
is
not
really
going
to
serve
the
express
congressional
purposes
of
1983
adequately.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
looking
specifically
at
the
pieces
of
the
cort
versus
ash
test,
some
of
them
just
don't
seem
to
fit
very
well.
the
first,
which
has
to
do
with
identifying
a
substantive
right
really,
is
in
the
1983
context
presumed,
if
we've
gotten
that
far,
by
the
pennhurst
sort
of
analysis.
if
there
is
no
substantive
right,
then
we
don't
get
to
the
preclusion
question.
so
that
part
of
the
traditional
four-part
test
for
the
implied
right
is
not
directly
a
part
of
the
preclusion
inquiry
for
1983.
the
other
piece
that
just
doesn't
fit
very
well
with
the
nature
and
purpose
of
1983
is
perhaps
the
fourth
step
of
the
cort
versus
ash
test,
that
which
would
have
us
look
to
whether
the
matter
is
one
in
which
state
law
has
something
to
say.
and
that
doesn't
fit
very
well
because
of
the
traditional
federalism
concerns
of
section
1983.
it
has
traditionally
been
viewed
by
this
court
as
a
supplemental
remedy
to
whatever
the
state
may
provide.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
there
is
some
awkwardness.
on
the
other
hand,
unless
some
specific
method
is
found
of
addressing
the
particular
nature
of
section
1983,
then
the
demands
of
that
statute
and
the
intent
of
congress
expressed
in
that
statute
are
just
not
likely
to
be
recognized.
now,
we
concede
that
there
is
some
similarity
in
sort
of
the
middle
and
the
core
tests
of
the
implied
rights
inquiry,
that
is
the
inquiry
into
congressional
intent,
and
the
section
1983
inquiry
about
preclusion.
but
there
is
a
difference
of
where
they're
coming
from
as
well.
the
implied
rights
inquiry
is
really
traditionally
applied
in
the
context
of
a
plaintiff
trying
to
meet
a
burden
of
establishing
congressional
intent,
from
whatever
evidence
is
available.
in
the
1983
context,
the
congressional
intent
that
you
start
with
is
the
expressed
intent,
express
intent
in
1983
itself.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
where
a
state
or
a
state
actor
is
involved,
yes.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that
is
correct.
it
is
defendant-specific,
in
that
sense,
and
it
is
only
in
that
context
that
this
area
of
examination
of
congressional
intent
would
be
different
from
the
implied
rights
inquiry.
the
nature
of
section
1983
is
such
that
the
sort
of
evidence
that
will
suffice
to
justify
preclusion
has
to
be
substantially
greater
than
that
which
would
defeat
a
plaintiff
attempting
to
establish
an
implied
right
of
action.
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that
there
is,
after
all,
in
1983
that
express
intent
that
private
parties
have
that
remedy
against
that
certain
class
of
defendants.
and
so
it
should
not
be,
that
express
grant
of
authority
to
proceed,
should
not
be
really
impeachable,
except
by
equally
strong
evidence.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
would
concede
that
you
have
to
identify
a
right
secured
by
the
constitution
and
laws,
as
section
1983
requires.
but
i
think
that
the
chief
problem
in
this
case
was
not
the
identification
of
a
right.
the
fourth
circuit
may
have
been
a
little
reluctant
about
it
and
they
never
really
examined
the
brooke
amendment,
but
they
seem
to
concede
that
there
was
a
right
involved
there
and
to
focus
instead
on
the
enforceability.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
i
think
in
some
respects
he
does.
he
challenges
only
whether
the
right
extends
to
the
reasonable
allowance
of
utilities,
as
we
say
that
it
does.
he
doesn't
appear
to
challenge
that
the
brooke
amendment
itself
establishes
some
rights
in
tenants.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
i
think
it
does,
your
honor.
it
doesn't
appear
expressly
in
the
brooke
amendment,
but
the
brooke
amendment
does
limit
the
portion
of
tenant
income
that
can
be
applied
to
rent.
what
you
have
to
do,
since
that
doesn't
say
what
you
get
for
your
rent,
it
only
says
how
much
rent
you
pay,
you
have
to
look
elsewhere
in
the
statute
to
see
what
you
get
for
the
rent.
and
the
elsewhere
that
we
would
recommend
is
the
definitional
part
of
what
was
originally
1437(a),
that
says--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--pardon?
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
we
don't
have
any
reservations
about
reading
that
together
with
the
statute,
but
we
think
that
there
is
adequate
strength
in
the
statute
itself
if
we
had
to
do
that.
this
is
not
a
case
where
we
have
to
separate
the
regulation
and
the
statute,
because
they
are
closely
tied.
but
i'm
trying
to
point
out
that
there
is
in
1437(a)
a
definition
of
low
income
housing
that
includes
not
only
the
dwelling,
but
also
embracing
the
necessary
appurtenances
thereto.
now,
both
before
and
after
congress
passed
the
brooke
amendment
hud's
regulations
interpreted
specifically
or
prescribed
specifically
what
tenants
were
supposed
to
get
for
their
rent.
and
in
those
regulations,
hud
said
not
only
the
dwelling,
but
also
the
equipment
that's
included
in
the
dwelling,
necessary
services,
and
reasonable
amounts
of
utilities.
that
was
the
standard
before
and
after
the
brooke
amendment
was
adopted,
and
that
was
the
standard
that
the
housing
authority
and
the
tenants
and
hud
and
everybody
agreed
on.
so
that
when
the
brooke
amendment
was
adopted,
that
limitation
of
25
percent,
now
up
to
30
percent,
of
family
income
that
could
be
charged
was
to
include
those
things
which
the
housing
act
had
previously
and
was
in
the
future
to
contemplate
being
provided
in
exchange
for
rent.
it
should
be
no
mystery
that
the
brooke
amendment
itself
doesn't
say
utilities.
the
brooke
amendment
doesn't
attempt
to
say
what's
covered.
it
only
says
what
the
tenant
pays,
and
what
he
gets
is
clear
from
the
other
part
of
the
statute
and
from
the
regulations.
now,
it
was
only
in
1980
that
hud
went
beyond
its
previous
approach
of
non-mandatory
guidelines
to
establish
a
firm
and
binding
and
mandatory
regulation
that
explained
how
utilities
allowances
were
to
be
calculated.
and
it
did
so
in
no
uncertain
terms,
and
it
made
a...
it
mandated
that
the
housing
authorities
receiving
public
housing
subsidies
begin
to
implement
that
regulation
immediately,
and
set
an
outside
deadline
of
120
days
for
doing
so.
the
regulation
provided
both
procedural
steps
to
be
followed
in
calculating
the
allowances
and
it
set
a
substantive
standard,
the
intent
being
that
not
more
than
ten
percent
of
the
tenants
in
a
given
size
of
housing
unit
should
have
to
pay
anything
more
than
their
25
percent
maximum
of
income
rent
in
order
to
enjoy
the
utilities
allowance
established.
when
that
happened,
the
housing
authority
was
duly
notified
by
hud,
as
the
record
shows,
and
told
to
implement
it
not
later
than
120
days
from
the
date
of
promulgation,
and
the
housing
authority
simply
refused
to
do
it.
the
housing
authority
continued
to
use
an
allowance
of
utilities
which
was
so
low
that
they
could
no
longer
explain
how
it
was
calculated.
and
instead
of
it
providing
adequately
for
90
percent
of
the
tenants,
it
seems
to
have
resulted
in
the
charging
of
additional
surcharges
to
90
to
100
percent
of
the
tenants
in
most
of
the
sizes
of
apartments,
for
most
of
the
quarters.
this
state
of
affairs
continued
even
after
the
120
day
deadline
had
passed,
even
after
tenant
demands
had
been
made
for
recalculation,
even
after
the
filing
of
this
suit.
so
there
is
simply
no
question
that
the
housing
authority
in
this
case
simply
refused
to
follow
the
mandate
of
hud.
now,
the
tenants
complained
in
the
district
court
that
this
was
illegal
and
they
sued
to
get
their
money
back
that
had
been
collected
in
excess
of
their
maximum
brooke
rent
during
the
period
in
which
these
surcharges
were
in
effect.
they
sued
under
both
1983
and
under
their
leases
with
the
authority.
the
fourth
circuit,
focusing
chiefly
on
the
1983
question,
found
that
congress
had
intended
to
preclude
such
private
actions
for
enforcement,
notwithstanding
the
specificity
with
which
the
brooke
amendment
identifies
the
tenants
as
the
beneficiaries,
in
fact
the
sole
beneficiaries,
of
the
rent
limit
in
that
statute.
and
the
way
in
which
the
question
was
approached
i
think
suggests
the
weakness
of
trying
to
apply
uniformly
a
cort
versus
ash
sort
of
inquiry,
because
it
led
to
what
is
definitely
a
wrong
conclusion.
despite
the
fact
that
in
this
context
there
is
no
congressional
express
preclusion
of
private
suits...
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute,
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
says
private
parties
may
not
sue...
and
despite
the
absence
of
any
express
private
remedy
effective
in
these
circumstances,
such
as
was
present
in
the
middlesex
county
sewerage
authority
versus
national
sea
clammers
case,
the
fourth
circuit
reached
out
to
find
from
the
very,
very
modest
evidence
of
the
granting
of
administrative
authority
to
hud
over
this
program
that
that
represented
congressional
intent
to
preclude
a
section
1983
remedy.
now,
when
you
examine
that
evidence
you
have
to
conclude
that
this
is
fairly
modest
administrative
authority
even
relative
to
other
federal
grant
programs,
such
as
the
afdc
program
for
instance.
it
does
not
extend,
according
to
hud
itself
and
to
the
wording
of
the
statute,
to
withdrawal
of
operating
subsidies
from
a
noncomplying
housing
authority,
except
in
very
narrow
circumstances.
the
administrative
authority
of
hud
operates
only
through
the
annual
contributions
contract,
and
that
section
of
the
united
states
housing
act
which
specifies
what
is
to
be
enforced
through
the
annual
contributions
contract
does
not
even
specify
the
brooke
amendment.
the
brooke
amendment
occurs
in
a
different
portion
of
the
act,
suggesting
that
that's
not
one
of
the
explicit
things
to
which
the
contributions
contract
must
be
addressed.
it
is
also
the
case
that
hud
itself
apparently
does
not
believe
it
has
the
enforcement
authority
that
the
fourth
circuit
ascribes
to
it
here.
while
we
believe
that
hud
may
be
overreading
the
extent
of
its
lack
of
power
here,
hud
has
taken
the
position
in
several
cases
which
are
cited
in
our
brief
that
it
itself
has
no
authority
to
enforce
the
brooke
amendment.
that
may
be
extreme,
but
it
certainly
appears
to
be
the
case
that
it
was
not
given
anywhere
in
the
act
or
in
its
administrative
authority
over
housing
authorities
an
exclusive
sort
of
right
to
enforce
the
act.
the
degree
to
which
the
fourth
circuit
went
astray
here
suggests
to
us
the
importance
of
returning
to
a
more
demanding
standard
for
when
a
section
1983
remedy
may
be
precluded.
it
is
simply
too
great
a
derogation
of
section
1983
to
accept
evidence
so
far
afield
as
that
in
this
case
of
hud's
authority
as
evidence
of
intent
to
preclude.
where
congress
has
expressly
established
in
1983
a
right
for
individuals
to
vindicate
their
federal
rights,
then
we
think
it
should
take
at
least
an
equally
clear
expression
in
the
program
statute
that
invests
the
substantive
right
to
bar
the
beneficiaries
of
that
substantive
program
right
from
exercising
the
1983
remedy.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that
is
quite
correct,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
brooke
amendment
itself,
the
statutory
enactment
of
1969,
ties
in
the
right
that
we're
talking
about
here.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
we
don't
rely
solely
upon
them.
what
we
think
is
happening
here
is
the
statutory
creation
of
a
right,
which
is
refined,
as
it
necessarily
must
be
in
the
fine
detail,
by
the
regulations.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that's
correct.
well,
what
we
are--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--well,
it
was
for
a
four-year
period,
your
honor,
during
which
there
was
discussion
about
whether
to
change
them,
during
which
at
any
time
hud
had
the
authority
to
waive
these
regulations
as
applied
to
this
particular
housing
authority
or
as
to
housing
authority
generally...
housing
authorities
generally...
and
did
not
do
so.
so
it
is
for
a
rather
extended
period
of
time,
actually.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that
is
our
position,
your
honor.
it
had
the
force
of
law
because
it
was
entirely
consistent
with
the
statute.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
there
has
been
no
claim
whatsoever
of
that,
your
honor.
the
housing
authority
has
suggested
in
various
ways
that
the
regulation
was
not
a
great
idea,
but
it
has
at
no
time
challenged
its
validity.
it
has
simply
said
that
it
could
have
thought
of
a
better
regulation,
and
it
also
contends
that
hud
eventually
did.
and
we
don't
challenge
the
decision
of
19--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
i
think
that
is
so,
your
honor,
because
of
the
nature
and
purpose
of
the
brooke
amendment.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
it
may
not
be
fatal
to
our
case
because
they
have
not
done
so,
of
course.
but
i
think
that
the
purpose
of
the
brooke
amendment
may
create
some
problems
for
hud
if
it
sought
to
do
so.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
and
the
reason
is
that
the
legislative
history
contemporaneous--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--i
believe
that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
the
absence
of
any
regulation,
there
is
the
legislative
purpose,
really,
of
assuring
that
only
25
percent
of
a
low
income
family's
meager
income
is
allocated
for
the
purpose
of
shelter.
that's
repeatedly
in
the
legislative
history,
and
that
purpose
of
shelter
includes
obviously
more
than
just
a
roof
over
your
head.
it
includes
all
those
things
which
housing
authorities
traditionally
had
provided.
that
i
think
is
what
we
are
trying
to
show
at
page
24
of
our
brief,
where
we
relate
the
brooke
amendment
itself,
justice
o'connor,
to
the
traditional
hud
interpretation
of
what
a
tenant
was
to
get
for
rent.
it
is
that
combination
of
the
amendment
with
the
regulations
of
hud
explaining
what
you
get
for
your
rent
that
we
think
imports
the
utilities
allowance
to
the
brooke
amendment.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
i'm
not
sure
of
that,
your
honor.
there
is
a
recognized
mechanism
in
hud
regulations
for
an
adjustment
to
be
sought
or
for
special
funding
to
be
sought
from
hud.
it
is
not
entirely
clear
to
us
at
this
point
that
we
or
the
housing
authority
would
have
the--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--that's
correct.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that
is
probably
the
case,
your
honor.
it
is
not
entirely
clear
whether
we
get
it,
but
that's
the
likely
source.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
pardon?
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
certainly
not,
and
they're
hardly
a
trustee
as
to
the
tenants'
own
money,
which
is
really
what's
at
issue
here.
we're
not
talking
about
some
tax,
state
tax
base
money.
we're
not
talking
about
something
the
federal
government
paid
or
didn't
pay.
what
we're
talking
about
is
tenant
money
in
excess
of
what
the
brooke
amendment
permits
being
returned
to
the
tenants.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
believe
that
wasn't
necessary
as
far
as
getting
an
understanding
of
what
the
regulations
mean,
because
the
regulations
really
quite
clearly
say
what
they
mean.
it
might
be
a
more
difficult
case
if
the
housing
authority
had
attempted
compliance
with
the
regulations
and
could
show,
other
than
by
some
ingenious
speculation
on
the
part
of
their
counsel,
what
the
difficulties
might
be
in
implementing
the
regulations.
but
that
is
not
the
case
here.
we
don't
have--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--i
don't
know
that
they
have
taken
a
position
specifically
with
regard
to
this
issue,
your
honor.
what
they
have
done
that's
very
important
is--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--that's
it.
and
they
also
said
in
comments
upon
the
1984
promulgation--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--well,
we
would
prefer
not
to
be
held
accountable
for
the
extent
of
their
authority,
but
only
for
the
extent
of
our
clients'--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--that
certainly
points
in
that
direction,
your
honor.
it
would
require
more
than
the
very
limited
authority
shown
here,
certainly.
the
implications
of
the
way
the
fourth
circuit
has
treated
this,
of
course,
are
substantial.
if
with
this
very
modest
grant
of
administrative
authority,
whether
you
read
it
as
the
statute
says
or
the
way
hud
reads
it...
either
way,
it's
a
fairly
modest
grant
of
administrative
authority
and
what
we
believe
is
a
very
clearly
vested
sort
of
right
in
the
individual.
if
that
combination
in
this
case
presents
preclusion
problems,
then
there
will
be
preclusion
problems
or
perhaps
an
insurmountable
preclusion
barrier
in
virtually
any
case
in
which
an
individual
tries
to
vindicate
their
individual
rights
in
a
grant
program,
without
regard
to
how
specifically,
how
concretely,
or
how
strongly
congress
in
the
program
statute
vested
the
individual
rights.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that
is
a
legitimate
question,
your
honor.
we
think
it
is
not
hard
to
find
the
individual
right
that
the
pennhurst
inquiry
calls
for
here,
because
of
the
specificity
of
the
brooke
amendment
itself,
which
both
in
its
legislative
history
and
in
its
original
wording
talks
about
the
family's
income,
the
fact
that
nobody
else
benefits
from
that
limit...
while
it
may
operate
as
a
standard
for
what
hud
pays,
it's
only
the
tenants
that
benefit
from
that
limit...
and
from
the
fact
that
the
regulations
that
tie
into
the
statute
are
themselves
phrased
in
terms
of
the
shalls
and
the
mandatory
elements
of
a
right
and
focus
very
specifically,
again,
on
what
the
tenant
is
to
get
for
his
rent.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
now,
i
believe
that
ultimately
it
is
tied
into
that,
but
my
recollection
of
the
regulation
is
that
it
does
give
absolute
sort
of
legislative
commands
to
the
housing
authority
about
how
it
must
perform
its
duties.
and
again,
we're
not
talking
here
about
an
ambiguous
performance
of
a
duty
or
a
discretionary
performance.
we're
talking
about
no
performance
at
all.
this
in
that
sense
is
the
classic
core
application
of
1983,
where
federal
statutory
provisions
for
the
benefit
of
an
individual
have
been
absolutely
defied.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that
would
be
a
very
broad
assumption,
justice
powell.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
i
don't
think
we
need
to
go
that
far.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
and
the
reason
is
this.
i
think
we're
tied
in
this
case
to
the
very
specific
grant
of
substantive
right
which
the
brooke
amendment
represents.
now,
the
fourth
circuit
at
least
has
held
that
other
provisions
of
the
housing
authority...
i
mean,
i'm
sorry,
of
the
housing
act...
don't
go
so
far
and
don't
grant
a
substantive
right.
without
conceding
that
those
decisions
are
correct,
we
recognize
that
the
case...
the
issue
must
be
addressed
in
each
case.
it
will
not
follow
from
a
holding
that
the
tenants
may
vindicate
their
brooke
amendment
rights
that
any
tenant
may
vindicate
any
right
that
he
asserts
against
a
housing
authority.
it
still
must
be
specifically
tied
into
some
provision
of
the
housing
act
which
grants
a
substantive
right.
another
important
point
about
that--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--well,
i'm
not
going
to
assume
that
they
might
not,
your
honor.
i
think
that
what
i'm
saying
is
only
that,
as
far
as
the
regulation
goes,
it
doesn't...
that
we're
relying
upon,
it
doesn't
address
that.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
if
they
don't
work.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
if
in
that
case
it
can
equally
be
shown
that
that's
tied...
and
i
think
it
probably
can,
to
follow
the
implication
of
your
question...
that
it
is
tied
to
a
right,
then
in
fact
we
may
have
an
enforcement
problem.
but
i
think
it's
important
to
note
that
we
have
had
that
perhaps
all
along.
since
the
brooke
amendment
was
passed
in
1969,
it
has
widely
been
assumed
that
tenants
may
sue
under
the
brooke
amendment
to
enforce
the
rental
limitation
in
that
amendment.
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
precluding
any
suit
under
the
united
states
housing
act
is
really
an
aberration
in
terms
of
what
has
happened
in
the
last
15
years.
it
has
been
assumed
that
tenants
could
sue.
in
fact,
as
the
cases
cited
in
our
brief
show,
they
have
sued.
they
have
not
sued
in
such
overwhelming
numbers
as
to
flood
the
courts,
but
the
assumption
that
they
had
suit
available
has
been
operative,
and
they
have
used
those
suits.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
it
is
my
understanding
state
courts
have
an
obligation
to
entertain
any
federal
claim.
the
real
question
here
is
whether
the
federal
courts
also
must
entertain
the
claim.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we
don't
think
that
that
addresses
the
question,
though,
of
the
problem
that
1983
poses
here,
of
course.
if
there
is
a
right
to
bring
a
1983
claim,
then
it
is
also
true
that
it
can
be
brought
in
federal
court.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
it
just
wouldn't
work
in
this
particular
context,
your
honor.
perhaps
in
some
it
might,
but
in
the
courts
of
virginia
the
court
that
would
have
jurisdiction
over
amounts
of
$200
and
$300,
such
as
is
the
case
here,
is
the
very
lowest
level
of
the
courts
and
not
of
record.
and
since
there
is
no
class
action
provision
in
virginia,
we'd
be
talking
about
1100
individual
tenant
suits
in
that
court
to
try
to
vindicate
this
right
and
get
these
damages
back.
totally
impractical.
in
other
circumstances,
in
other
courts,
it
might
be
possible.
but
where
section
1983
permits
this
sort
of
suit
in
federal
court
and
where
the
remedies
are
appropriate,
we
believe
the
fourth
circuit
should
have
addressed
that.
i'll
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
i
do,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
if
i
may
accept
the
invitation
of
justice
stevens
to
expand
a
little
bit
beyond
the
record
with
regard
to
the
screen
door
cases,
i
would
like
to
say
that
if
those
cases
are
brought
with
regard
to
the
housing
authority
in
roanoke
we
would
probably
be
bringing
them,
and
in
fact
there
are
very
few.
what
happens
in
fact
is
that
the
grievance
mechanism
does
work
in
individual
cases
to
some
extent.
it's
not
a
marvelous
thing,
but
if
the
problem
of
the
tenant
is
with
the
question
of
who
kicked
in
the
screen
door
and
who
should
pay
for
it,
the
grievance
mechanism
is
a
way
to
address
that.
what
the
grievance
mechanism
is
specifically
not
available
for,
according
to
hud
and
in
the
regulations
it
promulgated
to
implement
it,
is
for
challenges
to
the
policy
of
the
housing
authority.
and
that
makes
some
sense.
if
the
problem
is
a
project-wide
or
authority-wide
policy
problem
with
the
housing
authority,
then
taking
it
to
a
panel
is
not
only
impractical
but
it's
specifically
contrary
to
the
regulations.
and
it
certainly
never
gets
beyond
the
panel
in
that
mechanism
to
hud
itself.
so
in
fact,
some
matters
are
specifically
appropriate
for
grievance
mechanisms
and
some
aren't.
what
makes
this
case
particularly
a
federal
case
is
that
the
brooke
amendment,
as
the
sixth
circuit
has
recognized,
is
the
backbone
of
the
public
housing
program.
it
just
isn't
right
for
a
state
court
to
be
making
critical
determinations
of
what
the
brooke
amendment
means
and
how
it
affects
1100
families
in
public
housing
in
roanoke
as
a
matter
of
policy.
and
that
is
i
think
the
ultimate
reason
this
is
a
federal
case.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
for
non-enforcement
or
for--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--damages?
i
think
it
probably
would.
i
think
in
trying
to
decide
where
to
sue,
though,
you
try
to
identify
where
the
breach
is
clearest.
and
i
think
in
this
case
we
need
not
get
beyond
the
non-compliance
with
the
regulations
to
find
out
where
the
real,
the
ultimate
fault
lies.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
in
our
case,
our
complaint
is
clearly
non-compliance
by
the
pha.
hud
has
done
what
it
could
to
say
what
the
housing
authority
should
do.
that
it
didn't
do
it,
there
may
be
some
remedy
that
somebody
can
come
up
with
from
hud,
but
we
have
no
way
to
invoke
it.
there
is
no
mechanism
for
us
to
invoke
that
remedy.
what
we
can
do
is
we
can
exercise--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--to
invoke
a
remedy
from
hud.
i
mean,
perhaps
we
can
sue
hud.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
it's
always
possible
to
sue,
but
winning
is
another
question.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
i
think
the
enforcement
question
does
leave
an
avenue
open.
we're
not
there
yet.
but
i
think
that
under--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--underlying
the
question,
though,
is
the...
i
mean,
underlying
the
pursuit
is
the
question
of
whether
these
folks
have
done
something
wrong
in
the
first
place.
and
i
think
it's
putting
first
things
first
to
establish
that.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
pardon?
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
they
have
received
the
benefit
of
our
money
as
well.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
well,
it's
not
clear,
frankly,
at
this
point
whether
they
still
have
it
or
not,
your
honor.
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
we
paid
it,
we
know
that.
we
know
that.
and
over
a
period
of--
mr.
henry
l.
woodward
--they
certainly
haven't
given
it
back.
a
question
was
asked
earlier,
what
hud's
position
is
with
regard
to
the
private
remedy
of
1983
in
these
situations.
i
failed
to
recollect
that
in
a
couple
of
cases,
the
stone
case
in
the
district
of
columbia
circuit
and
the
brown
case
in
the
eleventh
circuit,
hud
has
taken
the
position
in
briefing
that
the
individual
tenants
may
assert
the
1983
remedy
to
redress
utilities
problems.
