you
mean
these
tenants
have
a
right
to
get
the
utilities
paid
for,
but
they
don't
necessarily
have
a
right
to
have
the
utilities
working?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
a
very
appealing
argument
in
the
next
case.
i
mean,
if
we
find
a
right
here,
won't
you
be
arguing
in
the
next
case
that,
you
know,
what's
the
use
of
having
utilities
paid
for--

--if
they
don't
work?

state
court
if
you
simply
did
not
execute
a
proper
lease.
if
the
amount
specified
in
the
lease
is
below
the
amount...
is
above
the
amount
that
the
federal
law
allows,
you
would
have
neither
a
right
in
the
state
court
nor
a
right
in
the
federal
court.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know,
that's
the
way
it's
supposed
to
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
you
have
a
housing
authority
that
executes
different
leases,
there
would
be
no
remedy
for
that
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
individual
lessee
would
have
no
remedy,
either
in
state
court
nor
in
federal
court,
so
long
as
the
defect
is
that
the
form
of
lease
that
the
authority
uses
does
not
comply
with
what
federal
law
requires,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
have
any
doubt
that
a
suit
against

would
lie?

well,
i

but
didn't
justice

ask
you--
--i
meant
sue
and
win.
i
know
you
could
sue
them.
[laughter]
i'll
have
to
be
more
careful.
