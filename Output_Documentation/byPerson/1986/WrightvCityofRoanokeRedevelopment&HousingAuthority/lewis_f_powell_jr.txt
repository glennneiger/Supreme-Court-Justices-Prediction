mr.
woodward,
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you,
but
i'd
like
to
ask
whether,
is
your
position
that
any
individual
tenant
could
bring
a
section
1983
action
about
any
complaint
he
had?
let's
say
the
tenant
felt
the
heat
was
inadequate
or
the
maintenance
was
inadequate
or
the
air
conditioning
wasn't
working.
could
the
individual
go
to
federal
court
and
bring
a
suit
in
1983?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
but
i
want
to
know
where
the
limits
of
your
argument
lead
us.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
would
you
summarize
the
grievance
procedure?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let's
take
an
individual
tenant
and
he
or
she
has
this
complaint.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what's
the
first
step?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
in
roanoke?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right.
carry
on
from
there.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
a
tenant
ever
get
to
hud
in
washington?
