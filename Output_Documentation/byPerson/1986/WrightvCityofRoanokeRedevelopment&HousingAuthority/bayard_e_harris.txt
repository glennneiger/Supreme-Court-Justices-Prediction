mr.
bayard
e.
harris
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
perhaps
if
i
might
begin
at
a
place
that
is
an
uncommon
beginning,
at
the
end.
the
end
of
the
case
as
presented
to
this
court
is
an
end
that
we
do
not
believe
was
anticipated
by
congress
in
1937,
nor
was
it
anticipated
through
the
course
of
the
legislative
history
of
this
statute.
mr.
justice
powell
has
noted
the
question
of
whether
or
not
an
individual
tenant
can
bring
a
complaint
over
other
things.
justice
scalia
has
rightly
questioned
whether
the
utilities
might
not
be
working
and
you
might
have
a
right
to
the
money
but
not
the
utility
to
work.
we
would
submit
to
you
that
the
regulations
of
hud
in
this
instance
are
identical
to
the
brooke
amendment
utility
regulations,
whether
you
view
them
from
the
question
of
maintenance
and
repair
of
the
facilities,
the
ventilation,
the
plumbing,
the
heating,
the
electrical,
or
whether
you
view
then
merely
from
the
narrow
attempt
of
petitioners
to
achieve
utilities
in
the
form
of
electricity.
please
allow
me
to
be
more
specific.
24
cfr
966
had
a
precursor
at
24
cfr
866
and
had
a
precursor
at
the
hud
handbook.
in
each
and
every
one
of
those
instances,
hud
has
uniformly
held
that
housing
authorities,
in
order
to
be
able
to
operate
under
the
scheme
envisioned
by
congress
in
1937,
a
scheme
envisioning
a
lease
and
a
relationship
of
landlord-tenant
sorts
of
things,
that
under
those
provisions
the
pha
could
charge
maintenance
for
everything
over
ordinary
wear
and
tear.
that
is
by
regulation.
moreover,
they
may
charge
late
charges,
they
may
charge
for
security
deposits,
they
may
also,
incidentally...
and
this
is
true
prior
to
the
brooke
amendment...
charge
for
excess
utilities,
particularly
where
those
utilities
are
incurred
through
the
use
of
major
tenant-supplied
appliances.
congress
has
embodied
those
regulations
in
the
very
same
statute
upon
which
petitioners
rely
in
this
instance.
petitioners
rely
under
what
is
commonly
known
now
as
the
brooke
amendment,
found
at
section
1437a(a)
of
the
act,
previously
found
at
section
1402,
and
embodied
in
the
housing
act
in
one
form
or
another
as
a
definition
of
low
rent
housing,
which
i
might
transfer
into
a
definition
of
what
you
get
for
your
dollar,
ever
since
1937.
in
1983
the
congress,
realizing
that
hud
was
about
to
repeal
its
regulations
pertaining
to
the
maintenance
of
the
lease
action,
amended
the
act
at
1437l.
and
interestingly
and
curiously
enough,
l
happens
to
coincide
with
"lease".
1437l
of
the
act
says
that
every
pha
lease
shall
have
a
reasonable
term,
shall
provide
for
decent,
safe,
and
sanitary
housing,
shall
provide
for
a
time
for
eviction
and
notice
of
cause
for
eviction,
things
which
hud
had
before
regulated.
now
congress,
recognizing
that
they
were
an
essential
part
of
that
program
enacted
in
1937
and
amended
in
1947,
'49,
'59,
'69,
'74,
and
through
the
course
then
of
the
eighties
in
'81
and
'83,
congress
had
linched
its
entire
scheme
of
landlord-tenant
proceedings
on
a
lease,
a
lease
which
they
had
now,
realizing
that
hud
might
back
away
from
the
regulations,
congress
enacted
an
amendment
which
said,
no,
you
may
not
do
it.
and
so
if
it
can
be
said
that
the
brooke
amendment
limit
to
rent
under
1437a(a)
and
the
regulations
under
24
cfr
865,
now
965,
if
these
rise
to
a
right
or
to
a
remedy,
then
so
does
every
term
of
every
lease
in
every
pha,
for
every
one
of
millions
of
families
in
this
country.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
there
is
a
substantive
right
under
the
lease,
if
it
please,
justice
stevens,
to
the
extent
that
that
relationship
landlord-tenant,
gives
rise
to
a
lease
right.
the
lease
in
this
case,
for
an
example,
gives
rise
to
a
utility
right.
the
hud
regulations
give
rise
to
the
same
regulated
utilities.
but
that
action
under
the
congressional
scheme
was
a
lease,
a
lease
between
the
landlord
and
tenant,
that
ensured
that
the
tenant
would
have
no
lesser
rights
in
public
housing
in
this
country
than
would
tenants
in
any
housing
in
this
country,
nor,
concomitantly,
would
they
have
greater
rights.
and
depending
upon
how
we
might
view
the
federal
judiciary,
the
remedy
of
the
federal
forum
differs
only.
but
if
you
look
at
congress'
intent
in
1937,
it
was
a
lease
arrangement.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
the
statute
does
that--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--your
honor.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
no,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
the
lease
provides
the
amount
of
rent,
and
that
section
5,
i
believe,
of
the
lease,
which
is
found
in
the
record,
it
also
provides
for
redeterminations
of
that.
and
there
has
been
perhaps
confusion
in
the
courts
over
that
very
issue,
and
hence
the
many
cases
cited,
never
to
reach
this
court
as
yet,
over
that
very
issue.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
the
lease,
your
honor,
would
i
believe
provide
for
a
fixed
amount
of
rent,
which
by
statute
can
be
no
more
nor
no
less
than
30
percent
of
income.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
the
remedy
in
that
instance
would
be
the
remedy
of
hud's
enforcement
of
the
annual
contribution
contract,
through
which
the
other
side
of
this
tripartite
arrangement
between
the
tenant
and
the
pha
and
hud
are
regulated.
and
indeed,
when
the
brooke
amendment
was
passed--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--yes.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
i
haven't
figured
out
the
answer
to
that
one,
justice
stevens,
and
would
that
i
could,
because
i
at
one
time
had
decided,
as
i
had
argued
and
moved
in
this
case
originally,
that
it
ought
be
dismissed
since
hud
was
an
indispensable
party
and
had
not
been
joined.
and
subsequent
to
my
having
the
bonus
of
making
that
motion,
the
decision
of
this
court
in
heckler
was
rendered
and
there
became
some
serious
question
as
to
the
wisdom
of
my
motion
at
that
moment.
the
district
court
having
taken
it
under
advisement,
i
was
never
forced
to
belabor
it
greater,
although
i
had
some
concern
because
as
a
practical
matter
under
the
annual
contribution
contract
it's
what
i
would
describe
to
this
court
as
my
mother
ship.
if
you
can
see
the
mother
ship
and
its
auditors
and
its
control
and
the
fact
that
the
pha
indeed
exists
by
reason
of
its
relationships
on
a
daily
basis
with
hud,
and
so
it
would
be
tough.
next
year
i'd
have
to
go
to
the
subsidy
meetings
and
say:
gosh,
i've
lost
all
this
money
and
i've
got
to
pay
all
these
folks,
and
what
are
we
going
to
do
about
it,
hud?
and
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
except
to
pose
it
back.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
i
don't
know,
your
honor,
that
he
would
have
a
right
even
in
federal
court--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--to
revise
a
lease.
i
believe
that--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--no,
sir,
i
believe
that
transcends
the
intent
of
congress
in
that
instance,
and
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
up
to
hud,
realizing
that
they
had
a
derelict
pha
on
their
hands,
to
exercise
section
1404
of
the
act,
which
explicitly
gives
hud
the
right
to
sue
and,
interestingly
enough,
also
gives
the
right
to
sue
hud.
and
whether
or
not
that
would
get
me
out
of
the
heckler
dilemma
or
not,
i
would
not
want
to
land
flat-footed
on
that
in
this
court.
i
think
i
might
wind
up
back
on
my
heels
a
bit.
but
i
do
wonder
whether
1404a
would
give
me
a
right
to
sue
hud.
it
certainly
gives
hud
the
right
to
sue
me,
and
i
have
very
little
doubt
that
they
would
come
round
to
me
and
say...
if
they
allocated
the
conflicting
interests
in
that
manner,
then
i
believe
they
would
come
round
to
me
and
say:
you
know,
get
in
line,
pha;
get
in
line
now;
and
if
you
don't
want
to
get
in
line,
we
want
to
meet
with
your
board
of
commissioners,
because
they'll
get
you
in
line,
mr.
executive
director
or
mr.
staff
member.
the
practical
reality
of
the
relationship
is
very
tight,
your
honor.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
that
the
housing
authority
was
obligated
to
follow
the
regulation?
i
think
the
housing
authority
followed
the
regulation,
your
honor.
and
i
believe
that
they
had
an
obligation
under
the
vcc--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--yes,
sir.
but
our
obligation
is
under
the
annual
contribution
contract.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
the
interesting
analysis
of
the
conflicting
interests
which
was
suggested
by
my
answer
to
justice
stevens'
question
brings
to
mind
a
point
that
i
think
is
particularly
interesting
and
is
not
treated
in
the
briefs.
if
i
might
share
it
briefly
with
this
court.
the
hud
regulations
at
24
cfr
865
et
seq.
,
and
at
965
in
their
current
form
are
a
little
different.
but
the
ones
at
issue
in
this
instance
are
a
consumption
set
of
regs.
they
are
based
on,
the
more
you
use
the
more
you
get,
if
you
adopt
the
petitioners'
view.
and
in
response
to
my
question
to
you,
justice
white,
i'm
not
sure
that
i
agree
with
petitioners'
view
of
what
these
regs
may
mean
in
terms
of
whether
or
not
all
of
these
very
nice
steps
on
the...
in
fact,
the
interrogatory
answers
say,
as
i'm
sure
the
court
is
aware,
that
we
deemed
our
compliance
in
compliance
with
the
regs.
but
nevertheless--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--provide
utilities,
free
utilities
in
a
reasonable
amount,
to
the
tenants
of
the
pha
in
this
instance.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
no,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
that
is
correct,
sir,
although
i
am
troubled
somewhat
by
going
back,
as
mr.
woodward
has
pointed
out,
that
i
somehow
have
said
that
there
might
be
some
sort
of
right.
the
question
in
this
instance
is
how
much
utilities,
and
when
you
get
into
the
regs
and
you
start
finding
things
like
wasteful,
individual
circumstance,
higher
use
by
reason
of
tenant-supplied
appliances,
when
you
get
into
the
new
regs
which
speak
of
luxuries
versus
necessities,
when
indeed
as
you
get
to
the
conflicting
allocation,
which
i
was
about
to
mention.
the
regs
also
provide
that
in
fiscal
year
1981
and
1982,
if
the
pha
does
not
effectuate
a
five
percent...
a
reduction,
excuse
me...
a
reduction
in
energy
use,
then
it
will
be
penalized
five
percent
of
its
operating
subsidy
in
the
subsequent
year.
this
is
at
section
990
of
the
regs
as
subsection
116.
the
contradictory
reality
is
that
at
the
same
times
those
regs
were
in
force
the
other
regs
were
saying
the
more
the
tenant...
if
you
believe
petitioners'
arguments,
and
i
do
not
subscribe
to
that,
your
honor.
but
if
you
adopt
it,
the
more
you
use
the
more
you
get,
but
if
you
give
away
more
we're
going
to
take
five
percent
of
your
money.
now,
this
was
hud
speaking
out
of
all
of
its
regulations
simultaneously.
and
it
illustrated
to
me
that
hud
has
got
responsibility
under
this
scheme
to
render
its
discretionary
judgment
over
the
conflicting
interests
that
have
got
to
be
reconciled
in
order
to
deal
with
how
do
you
allocate
the
moneys
available
and
how
do
you
provide
for
tenant
housing.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
it
is...
the
regulatory...
the
part
of
the
regulations
that
a
tenant
may
sue
for
is
that
part
which
is
embodied
in
the
lease,
which
ironically
is
regulated
in
itself
in
all
of
its
detail.
and
yet,
there
are
myriad
other
regulations
pertaining
to
housing
that
do
not
have
any
relationship
perforce
with
the
tenant,
but
have
an
indirect
impact
in
that
the
pha
and
hud
also
have
an
annual
contribution
contract
which
says
in
small
part
in
section
5
that
the
pha
will
abide
by
the
law.
and
that
gives
yet
another
part
of
this
tripartite
relationship
of
hud,
pha,
and
tenant.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
no,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
because
i
believe
that
the
remedy
at
that
point,
given
the
tripartite
scheme,
would
be
for
hud
to
come
in
and
say
either,
as
a
practical
matter
let's
get
together
because
next
year
we've
got
to
renew
your
subsidy
and
we
may
not,
or
to--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--yes,
sir.
and
i
can't
read
maine
without
also
reading
the
decisions
of
the
court
subsequent,
particularly
the
sea
clammers
case,
in
which
if
it
has
found
that
by
the
congressional
scheme
there
was
evidence
of
a
congressional
intent
to
foreclose...
and
congress
when
it
set
up
the
lease
arrangement
in
1937
certainly
did
not
envision
a
federal
remedy,
as
one
certainly
did
not
exist
in
1937.
when
the
brooke
amendment
was
passed
in
1969,
congress
certainly,
i
would
submit,
did
not
envision
a
federal
remedy
at
that
juncture.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
i
have
difficulty
with
that
for
one
reason,
your
honor,
and
that
is
simply
because
some
of
the
language
in
some
of
the
opinions
which
has
reference
to
the
fact
that
if
you
can't
forfeit
the
money
there
isn't
a
right.
and
quite
frankly,
i
think
it
is
not
a
pragmatic
response
for
any
pha
to
come
into
this
court
and
say
that,
as
a
practical
matter
we
built
these
projects
30
years
ago
and
now
we're
going
to
forfeit
that
money
and
leave
the
state
with
1100
low
income
tenants
sitting
in
these
30
year
old
buildings
that
are
going
to
fall
down
if
there
isn't
money
to
take
care
of
them.
and
i'm
very
reluctant
to
try
to
come
in
here
with
that
kind
of
argument.
i
think
it
is
much
more
the
pragmatic
response
to
say
that
there's
not
going
to
be
anything
of
that
sort
to
happen.
quite
the
contrary,
hud's
going
to
come
down
and
it's
going
to
say:
look
guys,
we've
got--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--yes,
or
i
can
freeze
your
money,
i
can
sue
you.
but
more
importantly,
i
own
you.
i've
owned
you
ever
since
your
inception.
and
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
an
active,
aggressive
hud
can
solve
that
problem,
has
full
legal
remedy
to
do
so,
and
i
believe
would
do
so.
but
to
get
into...
one
of
the
things
that's
bothered
me,
i
think,
most
of
all
about
this
case,
is
i've
wondered
a
little
bit
why
i'm
here.
the
real
complaint
these
petitioners
have
is
not
with
the
pha.
the
real
complaint
they
have
is
with
hud,
hud
that
they
contend
did
not
enforce
the
regulation.
moreover,
they
admit,
as
i
believe
was
pointed
out
earlier
by
question,
that
if
i
lose
hud
is
going
to
pay
the
bill.
i
don't
know
that's
true.
would
that
i
knew
it
was
true.
i'm
sure
that
i
could
reassure
my
client,
who
is
a
little
bit
more
local
and
a
little
bit
more
removed.
but
nevertheless,
that's
the
petitioners'
point,
that
they'll
get
the
money
from
hud;
that
if
i
win
i'll
just
get
less
subsidy
or
less
money
from
the
tenant...
or
more
money
from
the
tenant
and
less
subsidy.
i
have
no
interest
therefore
in
winning.
i
would
be
just
as
well
off
to
lose.
and
i
think
the
truth
of
the
matter
is
that
the
petitioners
have
revealed
their
hand
by
suggesting
to
this
court
that,
while
they
cannot
under
heckler
perhaps
sue
hud,
notwithstanding
my
attempt
to
stand
in
quicksand
of
1404a
and
maybe
get
around
heckler...
and
i
reserve
that
for
another
day
on
the
ill-begotten
chance
that
you
may
remand
me
and
i
have
to
try,
and
i
don't
really
want
to
come
back,
as
much
as
i've
enjoyed
it--
[laughter]
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
interpreting
a
regulation,
i
believe
they
would.
i'm
afraid
that
they
would
style
it
or
that
hud
would
try
to
restyle
it
as
a
failure
to
enforce
the
regulation
pertaining
to
utilities.
if
they
did
that
and
they
walked
full
into
the
teeth
of
heckler,
i
can
only
imagine
that
i
have
had
difficulty
distinguishing
the
two
cases,
although,
as
i've
indicated,
i've
left
myself,
on
the
chance
that
this
is
transcribed
and
i'm
back
in
the
district
court,
room
to
run,
because
i
certainly
want
to
talk
to
hud
about
it
in
that
event.
my
concern
is
that
if
my
hypothesis
is
correct
and
if
indeed
the
complaint
is
directed
toward
hud,
then
petitioners
do
the
heckler
case
an
injustice
by
suing
me
and
attempting
to
get
money
from
hud.
and
that
bothers
me
a
little
bit
about
this
case
on
just
a
very
basic
level.
i
think
that,
most
importantly,
one
of
the
things
that
we
have
said
throughout
is
that
the
idea
of
jurisdictional
kinds
of
claims
of
this
sort
or
remedies
of
this
sort
is
something
that
i
have
referred
to
before
and
would
leave
with
this
court
for
its
consideration
as
what
i
call
screen
door
jurisdiction.
screen
door
jurisdiction
is
not
the
flood
and
the
torrent,
the
flood
gate
of
1983
cases,
and
that's
where
the
idea
came
to
mind.
i'm
not
sure
that
even
petitioners
would
bring
us
a
floodgate
of
major
litigation.
but
they
would
certainly
bring
us
litigation
on
every
screen
door
kicked
in
in
every
housing
authority
across
this
country,
because
the
right
to
collect
for
that
maintenance
over
ordinary
wear
and
tear
is
the
very
self-same
right
that
they
urge
to
you
as
supports
the
claim
for
free
electricity
in
a
specific
amount.
screen
door
jurisdiction
might
be
lightbulbs
in
hallways,
it
might
be
failure
to
cut
lawns.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that's
the
prototypical
place
that
they
ought
to
go
and
do
on
numerous
occasions.
i'm
uncertain
of
my
breadth
of
knowledge,
but
i
feel
comfortable
to
say
that
most,
if
not
all,
of
the
50
states
have
passed
extensive
landlord-tenant
statutes.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
most
of
it...
to
answer
your
question,
it
is
no
more
than
ordinary
litigation
in
any
landlord-tenant,
your
honor,
and
not
that
many
cases.
most
of
them--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--i
don't
know
how
many.
i
do
know
that
most
of
these
cases
are
handled
under
the
tenant
grievance
mechanism,
which
is
also
mandated
by
hud
and
is
provided
for
as
a
part
of
the
lease,
under
section
13
of
the
lease
in
this
particular
instance
and
as
a
part
of
the
prototype
lease
required
by
1437k
of
the
act.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
no,
sir.
i
do
not
believe
a
federal
remedy
is
available,
but
i
do
believe
they
would
use
the
grievance
mechanism.
i
believe
that
if
a
federal
remedy
were
available,
that
that's
where
they
would
go,
because
it
does
have
class
action
impact
and
because
every
screen
door
and
every
broken
light
bulb
is
a
part
of
what
someone
has
once
referred
to
me
as
the
typical
seething
undercurrent
of
discontent
that
you
might
find
among
tenants
generally.
and
i
do
not
mean
to
characterize
any
particular
sort
of
tenancy,
but
i
am
comfortable
to
believe
that
people
who
don't
own
their
own
property
sometimes
get
unhappy
with
the
people
who
do.
and
they'll
take
the
best
and
shortest
route
to
take
on
that
landlord
they
can.
unfortunately,
if
that
landlord
right
is
not
in
the
forum
where
it
really
belongs,
where
it
can
be
processed
expeditiously
and
by
people
with
that
kind
of
expertise,
if...
they
will,
in
the
words
of
some
friend
of
mine,
who
said
don't
make
a
federal
case
cut
of
it,
they
will,
given
that
right
or
given
that
remedy.
and
i
think
that
that's
outside
of
the
ambit
of
what
the
congress
intended
when
it
set
up
a
virtually
unique
situation
50
years
ago
with
a
lease
arrangement
with
a
landlord-tenant
relationship,
recognizing
that
they
were
dealing
in
leaseholds.
the
principle
that
we
suggest
with
regard
to
the
cases
is
really
quite
simple.
there's
no
need
to
make
a
federal
case
of
this.
there
is
a
grievance
mechanism,
there
is
a
leasehold
remedy
in
state
court,
and
most
importantly,
taken
as
a
whole
under
the
sea
clammers
tests,
that
that
is
the
remedy
anticipated.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
it
is
processed
through
ultimately
to
a
panel,
which
is--
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
--the
first
step
is
to
lodge
a
complaint
with
the
housing
authority.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
yes,
sir.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
that
ultimately
goes
through
two
levels,
i
believe,
and
perhaps
three,
of
management
within
the
staff
of
the
housing
authority.
at
that
point
a
panel
is
appointed,
and
i
frankly
can't
recall
right
now
how
it
is
constituted.
but
it
encompasses
not
only
management
representatives,
but
tenant
representatives.
there
are
due
process
rights
attached
to
that.
there
is
opportunity
to
be
heard,
to
be
represented
by
counsel.
indeed,
that
has
happened
as
recently
as
a
few
weeks
ago
over
a
twelve
dollar
claim
with
which
i
am
familiar.
and
those
panel
members
sit
and
hear
a
full-fledged
discussion
of
whether
or
not
something
has
happened
according
to
the
way
it
ought,
according
to
the
lease,
according
to
the
other
regulations
of
the
housing
authority.
it
terminates
at
that
point,
although
it
is
enforceable
in
my
view
in
state
court
because
the
grievance
procedure
itself
is
a
part
of
that
same
lease
at
section
13.
so
i
believe
they
have
a
lease
entitlement
to
the
grievance
remedy,
as
well
as
to
the
hud
regulatory
remedy.
and
consequently,
while
none
that
i
know
of
have
gone
to
state
court,
i
believe
were
you
to
say
you
had
been
denied
the
grievance
mechanism
you
could
seek
declaratory
relief
in
the
state
forum.
mr.
bayard
e.
harris
not
to
my
knowledge.
i
don't
know
that
he
sought
that.
the
lease
demonstrating
this
adequate
remedy
i
think
brings
you
squarely
to
the
simple
question
of,
why
make
a
federal
case
of
this
if
you
have
the
potential
of
what
i
have
referred
to
as
screen
door
jurisdiction
and
where
you
have
an
adequate
remedy
at
state
law.
the
lease
demonstrates
this
congressional
intent,
coupled
with
the
administrative
regulation.
if
there
are
no
other
questions
from
the
court,
i
would
ask
you
to
affirm.
