justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
woodward,
if
you...
you're
suing
for
money
as
i
understand
it
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
prevail
in
this
case,
would
your
opponent
have
a
claim
over
against
hud?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
not
suggesting
you
would.
but
it
seemed
to
me,
as
i
understood
the
picture,
what
your
clients
don't
pay
hud
has
to
pay
the
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
you
get
a
little
more
money
out
of
your
opponents,
it
seems
to
me
they
have
to
get
that
money
from
hud.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
they're
not
the
typical
trustee
in
this
situation
then,
are
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they're
not
a
typical
disinterested
trustee
insofar
as
they
might
have
views
on
what
should
be
done?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
hud
has
never
actually
tried
to
take
a
formal
position
in
this
litigation,
have
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
"sue".
now,
of
course
your
claim
could
be
asserted
in
state
court,
if
i
understand
you,
could
it
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
as
i
understood
the
fourth
circuit,
it
assumed
that,
a,
there
was
a
substantive
right
and,
b,
it
was
enforceable
in
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
harris,
let
me
just
interrupt
you
with
a
question.
do
you
agree
that
these
people
have
a
remedy
in
the
state
courts
for
the
very
thing
they're
claiming
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
a
substantive
right
involved,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
put
a
little
different
question.
do
the
regulations
regulate
the
amount
of
the
rent?
get
away
from
all
these
fringe
things
like
the
utilities
and
the
heat
and
so
forth.
but
they
do
impose
a
limit
on
the
amount
of
rent
that
can
be
charged
based
on
the
person's
income,
is
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
statute
does
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
the
housing
authority
should
charge
more
than
the
permitted
statutory
rent,
would
there
be
a
remedy
in
federal
court
for
that
kind
of
thing?
justice
john
paul
stevens
there
would
not,
even
if
it's
a
very
simple,
flagrant
case?
you'd
have
to
go
to
state
court,
would
be
your
view?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
hud
were
to
sue,
it
would
have
to
pay
for
whatever
it
recovered
on
behalf?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
one
other
question,
following
up
on
justice
scalia's.
supposing
you
had
a
form
lease
that
you
used
that
did
contravene
the
statute,
so
that
we
have
an
argument
then
about
whether
the
tenant
could
sue
for
the
excess
rent.
would
he
have
a
forum
in
which
he
could
get
equitable
relief
to
have
a
different
lease
executed
to
conform
to
the
statute,
and
if
so
could
he
do
that
in
federal
court,
as
he
did
i
guess
here?
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
equitable
relief.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
to
compel
the
authority
to
comply
with
the
federal
regulations,
would
be
the
way
to
phrase
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
harris,
do
you
have
a
lot
of
screen
door
litigation
in
state
courts
in
these
projects?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i'm
not
talking
about
just
general
landlord-tenant
litigation.
of
course
there's
a
lot
of
that.
but
in
these
housing
projects,
is
there
a
great
deal
of
litigation
brought
by
tenants
against
your
client
in
state
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
much
of
a
burden
is
it?
i
mean,
is
there
hundreds
of
these
cases
every
year?
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
suggesting
that
if
a
federal
remedy
were
available,
the
tenants
would
no
longer
use
this
grievance
procedure
that
the
regulations
provide
for?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
don't
they
have
your
money,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
they
have
your
money,
too?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
they
actually
have
the
money,
don't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
but
you
paid
it.
