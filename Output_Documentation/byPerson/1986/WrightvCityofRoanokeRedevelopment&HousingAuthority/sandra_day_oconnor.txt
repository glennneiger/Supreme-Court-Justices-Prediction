justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
woodward,
that's
assuming
that
there
is
a
substantive
right
enforceable
by
these
plaintiffs
at
all,
isn't
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
are
we
really
locking
here
only
at
an
alleged
right
that
hud
itself
created
with
regulations
in
1980
and
then
withdrew
in
1984?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
don't
rely,
then,
on
the
hud
regulations
for
the
creation
of
this
so-called
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
certainly
isn't
anything
in
the
brooke
amendment
very
specifically
about
these
utility
costs,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
we
really
have
to
focus
on
the
regulations,
and
that
was
for
a
very
short
span
of
time,
wasn't
it?
