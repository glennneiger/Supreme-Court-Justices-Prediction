chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
arguments
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
85-5915,
brenda
e.
wright
et
al.
versus
the
city
of
roanoke
redevelopment
and
housing
authority.
you
may
proceed,
mr.
woodward.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
woodward,
from
what
you
say
i
gather
that's
a
somewhat
different
test
than
the
test
for
an
implied
cause
of
action
under
a
federal
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
why
do
you
say
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
it
is
as
a
practical
matter
kind
of
awkward
to
have
two
different
tests
for
such
closely
related
things,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
one
of
the
questions
here
is
whether
there
is
a
vested
individual
right,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
phrased
in
terms
of
what
hud
will
contribute
to
the
local
housing
authority,
not
in
terms
of
just
an
across
the
regulation,
across
the
board
regulation,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
the
preference
for
federal
court
over
state
court
here?
why
not
bring
an
ordinary
landlord-tenant
action
in
state
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
woodward.
we
will
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
harris.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
draw
the
line
essentially,
mr.
harris,
as
to
what
the
tenants
can
sue
for
and
what
is
left
to
these
considerations
you're
just
mentioning,
what's
in
the
lease
the
tenants
can
sue
the
pha
for
if
it's
not
furnished,
but
the
section
you
just
mentioned
is
left
to
some
sort
of
other
kind
of
adjustment
between
the
pha
and
hud?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
harris,
if
you're
correct
in
saying
that
the
tenants'
real
complaint
is
with
hud,
i
suppose
they
might
have
some
sort
of
an
action
similar
to
that
which
we
recognized
last
term
in
brook
versus
united
auto
workers,
to
sue
hud
over
some
interpretation
of
the
regulation
they
claim
was
wrong
but
hud
was
adhering
to.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
harris.
mr.
woodward,
do
you
have
anything
more
to
say?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
have
about
four
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
complaint
the
non-compliance
by
the
pha
or
the
non-compliance
by
hud?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
woodward.
thank
you.
the
case
is
submitted.
