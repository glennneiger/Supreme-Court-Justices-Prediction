justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brooks,
you're
at
pains
not
to
require
the
employer
to
come
in
and
confess
that
he's
been
discriminating
in
the
past,
but
i
just
wonder
how
secure
your
assurance
is.
he
doesn't
have
to
come
in
and
say:
i've
been
guilty
of
discrimination
in
the
past.
but
in
order
to
defend
against
a
suit
by
the
non-minority
employee
who
hasn't
been
promoted
he's
going
to
say:
well,
you
know,
i'm
not
saying
i
was,
but
i
may
have
been.
right?
he
has
to
come
in
and
put
in
that
evidence,
leaving
himself
open
to
later
suits
by
people
who
say:
well,
he
didn't
say
he
was,
but
he
said
he
may
have
been,
and
to
prove
that
he
may
have
been
he
confessed
this,
this,
and
this,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
just
that
he
may
have
been
discriminating.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
no
employer's
going
to
like
to
do
that.
i
mean,
you're
just
developing
evidence
for
somebody
else
to
use
in
a
later
suit
against
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
seem
to
me
to
put
the
employer
between
a
rock
and
a
hard
place.
in
order
to
validate
his
plan,
he
has
to
show
that
there
is,
what,
a
likelihood,
a
potentiality,
what,
something
that
he's
discriminated
in
the
past.
justice
antonin
scalia
was
that
the
goal
that
was
applied
when
mr.
johnson
was
denied
his
promotion?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
at
that
time
they
were
using
the
countywide
pool?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
the
case
we're
trying,
right?
we're
not
trying
somebody
else
who
came
up
after
there
was
a
three
out
of
55
requirement,
somebody
who
came
up
when
there
was
a
what,
30
percent
requirement?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it
seems
to
me
your
response
to
justice
o'connor
is
utterly
irrelevant
to
this
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
mr.
johnson's
case,
i
thought,
and
he's
complaining
about
being
denied
a
promotion.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
you're
saying
he
was
not
applying
a
30
percent
quota?
justice
antonin
scalia
when
mr.
johnson's
case
came
up
for
promotion,
was
the
agency
applying
a
30
percent
goal
or
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
goal.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
mean
it
is
statistically
reasonable
to
expect
as
many
women
to
be
working
on
road
crews
and
to
believe
that
if
there
aren't
that
proportion
there
must
be
discrimination,
as
there
are
to
think
that
there
are
women
working
in--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
is
that
based
on?
human
experience
or
some
governmental
policy?
justice
antonin
scalia
on
human
experience?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
this
country?
justice
antonin
scalia
without
even
considering
at
all
whether
you
can
bring
forward
any
patently
valid
justification
for
the
statistical
discrepancy,
for
instance
the
relevant
pool
is
not
all
women
working
in
the
county,
but
rather
women
working
in
this
particular
craft
or
this
particular
area?
without
even
considering
that,
you're
entitled
to
say,
oh,
we're
at
risk
for
a
discrimination
suit,
and
we
can
immediately
begin
discriminating
on
the
basis
of
race
or
sex
in
our
promotion
and
hiring?
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me
make
sure
i
understand
the
sweep
of
your
argument,
mr.
woodside.
if
i
understood
your
answer
to
justice
white
correctly,
you're
asserting
that
a
government
always
has
the
right
to
institute
a
plan
that
permits
discrimination
in
hiring
and
in
promotion
on
the
basis
of
race
or
sex
whenever
its
work
force
does
not
contain
the
same
proportion
of
race,
minority
race
or
that
sex,
as
the
work
force
at
large?
is
that
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
that
alone
is
enough
to
show,
that
statistical
disparity
is
enough
to
justify
an
affirmative
action
plan,
that
is
to
say
discrimination
by
the
government
on
the
basis
of
race?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
you're
hedging
it.
i
mean,
i
was
bringing
in
statistical
significance
in
my
earlier
question,
that
the
mere
fact
that
the
work
pool
in
general
contains
30
percent
women
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
this
particular
craft
or
trade
or
occupation
should
have
30
percent
women.
and
you
rejected
that.
you
said
it's
enough
if
working
women
constitute
30
percent
of
the
work
force.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
now
you
sound
like
the
other
side.
now
you're
saying
that
it
isn't
enough
to
just
have
a
statistical
disparity,
that
the
employer
has
to
have
some
reason
to
believe
that
the
statistical
disparity
is
the
result
of
discrimination.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
justify
immediate
implementation
of
an
affirmative
action
action
plan?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
they're
trying
to
prove
that
here
and
you're
saying
it's
irrelevant.
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
saying
that
your
client
was
authorized
to
institute
the
affirmative
action
plan
because
of
the
statistical
imbalance.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
not
no
women,
just
not
necessarily
to
impose
30
percent
women.
that's
what
your
plan
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
she
didn't
get
it
because
she
was
better
qualified.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
percentage
did
women
then
make
up
of
the
particular
category
of
jobs,
after
her
promotion?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
johnson,
who
had
had
his
eye
on
this
job
for
some
time,
apparently,
and
had
taken
a
demotion
and
worked
in
a
lower
paying
job
for
several
years
in
order
to
obtain
better
qualification
in
order
to
get
this
promotion,
he
competed
head
to
head
with
the
woman
who
ultimately
got
the
job.
he
was
selected
and
would
have
gotten
the
job
but
for
the
fact
of
the
affirmative
action
program.
she
had
been
rated
less
qualified
and
was
given
the
job
in
preference
to
him,
solely
by
reason
of
the
affirmative
action
plan.
isn't
that
the
facts
of
the
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
served
in
the
job?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
had
served
in
the
job
previously,
hadn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right,
serving
above
his
grade,
but
on
an
acting
basis.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
concern,
mr.
woodside,
is
not
about
preventing
employers
from
doing
what
they
think
is
best
for
the
work
force.
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
that,
to
go
back
to
the
rock
and
the
hard
place
analogy,
the
employer
is
faced
with
the
possibility,
and
state
employers
in
particular,
of
getting
caught
with
affirmative
action
suits.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
one
way
to
avoid
being
between
the
rock
and
the
hard
place
is
to
put
mr.
johnson
between
you
and
the
rock.
and
that's
the
risk.
that's
the
risk
that
occurs
here.
in
order
to
avoid
all
possibility
of
an
affirmative
action
suit,
it's
very
easy
for
an
employer
to
say:
well,
why
should
i
worry
about
my
skin;
i'll
just
adopt
an
affirmative
action
program,
discriminate
against
mr.
johnson
or
anybody
else
on
hiring,
and
that's
perfectly
lawful,
and
simply
appeal
to
statistical
disparity.
i'm
not
worried
about
his
doing
it
for
the
good
of
the
work
force.
he'll
do
it
for
the
good
of
the
employer.
i
mean,
that's
the
way
people
are
normally
motivated.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
defense
to
the
prima
facie
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
has
a
prima
facie
case,
and
i
thought
you
had
been
saying
that
so
long
as
there
is
a
prima
facie
case
he
can
institute
an
affirmative
action
plan.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
maybe
you
should
have
given
a
different
answer
to
justice
stevens.
justice
antonin
scalia
me,
too.
i
should
have
asked
justice
scalia.
[laughter]
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
brooks,
can
you
explain
one
thing
to
me?
i'm
a
little...
what
difference
does
it
make
whether
the
proper
proportion
in
this
particular
labor
pool,
if
we're
playing
statistics,
was
30
percent
or
5?
what
difference
does
it
make?
inasmuch
as
there
were
no
women
in
this
job
category
at
the
time
anyway,
even
if
the
percentage
were,
the
proper
percentage
were
5
percent
instead
of
30
percent,
presumably
in
implementing
the
affirmative
action
plan
the
employer
would
have
been
justified
in
preferring
this
woman.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
believe
there's
a
harmless
error
rule?
that
is,
that
even
if
the
employer
had
used
the
right
percentages,
an
affirmative
action
plan
based
on
that
would
have
justified
preference
to
this--
