justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
you
another
question
here.
supposing
the
plan...
it
doesn't
quite
say
this.
it's
kind
of
vague
and
general,
but
supposing
there
was
a
provision
in
the
plan
that
said
if
there
are
any
substantial
work
pools,
such
as
238
skilled
craft
positions,
and
they
had
described
10
or
15
of
them,
in
which
there
is
absolutely...
representation
for
women,
that
it
shall
be
an
objective
of
the
plan
to
hire
the
first
qualified
woman
that
applies
for
that
job,
just
to
break
the
line
and
get
some
representation,
and
that
was
the
sole
reason
given.
would
that
also
be
equally
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
saying
promotions
always
have
to
be
made
on
merit,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
agree
it's
appropriate.
do
you
think
the
statute
requires
that
all
promotions
be
made
on
merit?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
absence
of
any
proof
of
past
discrimination.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
would
the
past
discrimination
change
the
picture?
i
understand
that
the
judicial
decree
really
doesn't
have
any
broader
power
than
the
employer
would
have
just
adopting
a
new
rule?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
weber,
the
weber
case,
requires
proof
of
past
discrimination?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
ask
again.
really,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
under
your
view
of
the
law
that
it
makes
any
difference
what
the
plan
is,
because
your
client
was
better
qualified
than
the
woman
and
that's
the
end
of
the
case.
and
there's
no
past
discrimination
and
we
don't
have
to
know
anything
else.
why
do
we
even
have
to
look
at
the
plan?
justice
john
paul
stevens
based
on
statistics,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
woodside,
i'm
puzzled
when
you
say
that
this
was
not
a
case
of
an
automatic
preference
for
a
woman.
but
that's
the
only
reason
she
got
the
job.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean
it's
the
only
reason
he
didn't
get
it,
the
other
way
around.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
that's
not
what
happened.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
until
she
registered
a
complaint
with
the
affirmative
action
section
she
was
out,
isn't
that
correct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
know.
maybe...
i
just
don't
understand
how
you
can
say
this
is
not
an
automatic
preference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
be
a
violation
of
the
statute
if
the
county
said,
in
departments
where
there
are
238
men
and
you
get
a
qualified
woman
that
comes
in,
let's
automatically
give
her
some
favored,
better
consideration
than
we
would
give
a
man?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you're
just
saying
that's
not
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
ask
one
more
question.
i've
still
been
trying
to
figure
out
the
answer
to
the
one
justice
o'connor
asked
you
a
while
ago.
you
have
an
employer
that
employs
238
people.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
has
no
women
in
the
work
force
at
all.
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
knows
that
no
woman
has
ever
applied.
he's
never
discriminated.
he
knows
that
to
be
a
fact.
under
your
interpretation,
he
cannot
decide
that
he
would
like
to
hire
a
few
women
in
order
to
minimize
the
risk
of
suit
or
just
because
he
thinks
it's
a
healthy
thing
to
do,
whereas
somebody
who
knows
he
has
discriminated
in
the
past
can
take
and
can
adopt
an
affirmative
action
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
hypothesis
is,
whatever
facts
are
relevant,
he
knows
there
just
has
never
been
any
discrimination
here,
whatever
the
reasons
might
be.
but
i
gather
on
your
view
he
could
not
adopt
an
affirmative
action
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
did
all
the
hiring
himself
and
he
knows
he
never
had
any
applications.
