ms.
constance
e.
brooks
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
governed
by
the
principles
that
were
established
by
this
court
in
wygant
versus
jackson
board
of
education,
that
before
embarking
upon
a
voluntary
affirmative
action
program
a
public
employer
must
have
convincing
evidence
that
remedial
action
is
warranted
and,
finding
that
convincing
evidence,
develop
a
remedy
which
is
narrowly
tailored.
in
this
case,
we
have
neither
convincing
evidence
that
there
was
a
remedial
purpose
nor
was
this
remedy
narrowly
tailored
when
the
santa
clara
county
transportation
agency
deprived
petitioner
paul
johnson
of
a
well-earned
promotion.
first,
again,
in
the
ideal
world,
before
developing
a
program
an
employer
would
look
at
his
work
force
statistics,
compare
them
with
the
relevant
labor
market,
consider
if
there
was
other
probative
evidence
of
discrimination,
and
finally,
as
a
third
step,
eliminate
explanations
other
than
discrimination,
and
these
are
the
kind
of
explanations
that
an
employer
would
ordinarily
consider
in
rebutting
a
title
7
case.
but
even
if
the
employer
doesn't
do
this
at
the
outset,
the
employer
could
certainly
do
that
when
the
program
and
an
employment
action
taken
under
it
is
challenged.
the
agency
neither
went
through
the
process
at
the
beginning
nor
was
the
agency
able
to
come
forward
with
convincing
evidence
of
remedial
purpose.
the
district
court
heard
the
corroborating
testimony
of
discrimination.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
your
honor,
they
can
only
remedy
that
imbalance
if
in
fact
it
is
the
result
of
discrimination.
first
of
all--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--i
don't
believe
that
it
should,
and
let
me
explain
why.
on
one
hand,
we
know
that
before
you
embark
on
an
affirmative
action
program
just
good
intentions
are
not
enough.
on
the
other
hand,
we
know
that
we
shouldn't
require
an
employer
to
confess
liability
under
title
7.
somewhere
in
between
lies
the
test,
and
we
don't
necessarily
have
the
written
rule
as
to
what
should
be
sufficient.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
i
beg
your
pardon?
specifically?
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
this
court
took
judicial
notice
that
you
had
had
other
findings
of
discrimination
against
the
same
employer
and
the
same
union,
and
again
it
found
that
the
plan
itself
was
sufficiently
narrow
to
justify
it.
but
that
was
the
remedial
purpose.
here,
your
honor--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--this
court...
yes,
your
honor.
in
this
case,
however,
the
job
for
road
dispatcher
was
not
underrepresented
with
women,
and
the
fact
that
the
agency
relied
on
the
fact
that
there
were
no
women
in
the
skilled
craft
worker
category
should
have
no
bearing
whatsoever
on
this
promotion.
there
were--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--yes,
your
honor.
but
i
would
equate
that
firm
basis
with
convincing
evidence.
and
what
we
would
require,
and
which
i
think
is
what
was
the
problem
here,
is
that
the
employer
in
developing
that
firm
basis
needs
to
consider
why
its
statistics
are
what
they
are.
and
there
were
a
number
of
explanations
raised.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
yes.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
238.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
yes.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
yes.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
in
this
case
no,
because,
first
of
all,
on
the
face
of
the
plan
and
the
testimony
in
the
trial,
it
was
conceded
that
the
reason
you
had
zero
there
was
societal
and
attitudinal,
and
net
necessarily
discrimination.
and
specifically,
this
agency
had
had
an
affirmative
action
program
in
place
for
about
five
years.
they
had
been
aggressively
recruiting
and
hiring
women
throughout
the
work
force.
they
had
been
doing
the
same
with
minorities.
and
they
had
made
substantial
increases
in
the
numbers.
and
to
infer,
again
by
1980,
that
you
had
discrimination
in
the
skilled
craft
worker
category
that
required
an
employment
goal
by
promotion
was
simply
not
correct.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
your
honor,
when
the
agency
developed
its
program
and
when
this
case
was
tried
there
was
no
evidence
of
what
the
relevant
labor
pool
was.
and
in
fact,
the
agency
relied
entirely
on
the
countywide
working
force
for
women,
not
the
labor
pool.
we
offered
a
petitioner's
lodging
showing
that
roughly
seven
percent
of
the
women
in
this
county
at
that
time
were
in
the
skilled
craft
labor
jobs.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
no,
your
honor.
the
goal
set
at
the
time
the
petitioner
was
denied
the
promotion
was
36.4
percent.
they
didn't
institute
those
short
term
goals
until
after
petitioner
filed
suit
against
the
agency.
at
the
time
petitioner
lost
his
promotion,
the
goal
was
36.4
percent.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
certainly
with
respect
to
what
happened
to
the
petitioner,
there's
no
question
they
didn't
have
any
short
term
goals.
if
this
court
is
going
to
go
forward
with
some
guidelines,
i
think
that
the
relevant
labor
market
is
the
appropriate
test.
that
has
to
be
part
of
the
convincing
evidence
standard
that
the
court
should
look
at.
but
the
court...
but
the
agency
needed
to
go
behind
those
statistics
and
consider
whether
that
number
zero
had
sources
other
than
affirmative
actual
discrimination
by
the
employer.
we
had
testimony
in
the
trial
that
it
was
attitudinal.
the
plan
itself
states
that
women
were
"traditionally
not
employed
in
the
job.
"
the
plan
doesn't
suggest
that
the
tradition
had
anything
to
do
with
the
agency's
misdeeds.
and
even...
and
perhaps
more
important,
we
find
that
the
agency
had
been
actively
recruiting
and
bringing
women
in.
and
because
the
agency
never
kept
applicant
flow
data,
we
have
no
idea
how
many
women
ever
applied
for
this
job.
but
i
think
that
the
factors
of
the
effective
affirmative
action
program,
the
testimony
that
they
were
having
trouble
recruiting
women,
necessarily
means
that
no
women
were
applying
for
this
specific
job
and
at
this
specific
time.
and
before
we
leave
this
subject,
i
think
it's
very
important
to
point
out
that
in
the
road
dispatcher
position
specifically
and
dispatchers
in
general
25
percent
of
the
agency's
employees
were
women.
we
were
not
in...
and
the
relevant
labor
market
at
that
time
was
about
22
percent.
so
in
the
narrow
focus
of
what
happened
to
the
petitioner
and
what
the
agency
was
doing,
there
was
no
remedial
purpose
whatsoever,
and
the
plan
should
never
have
applied
to
that
particular
aspect.
i
think
it's
also
clear
that
this
plan
was
never
narrowly
tailored
in
an
important
sense.
first
of
all,
we're
in
the
promotion
situation,
not
in
terms
of
hiring,
promotions.
and
the
burden
of
this
plan
applied
entirely
upon
the
petitioner.
we
know
from
the
record
that
the
job
of
road
dispatcher
did
not
come
open
very
often.
petitioner
had
worked
for
the
agency
for
13
years
and
this
job
came
open
only
twice.
the
goals
applied
throughout
the
work
force.
the
goals
were
not
limited
to
the
lower
echelon
positions.
the
goals
applied
whenever
an
employer
was
going
to
make
a
decision.
and
this
goes
into
what
clearly
barred
any
non-minority
employee
when
he
was
going
up
for
a
promotion
and
was
going
head
to
head
with
an
employee
that
was
deemed
to
be
protected
under
the
plan.
in
this
situation,
the
plan
requires
that
the
agency
give
the
protected
employee
special
consideration.
and
again,
this
applies
throughout
the
job
force.
the
plan
imposes
substantial
and
coercive
measures
on
the
agency
to
be
sure
and
meet
his
affirmative
action
goals.
if
there
is
an
individual
manager,
at
the
end
of
the
year
he'll
be
evaluated
on
whether
he
met
those
goals.
and
finally,
there
is
no
provision
anywhere
in
the
agency
policy
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
unprotected
employees.
and
the
whole
attitude,
the
focus
was:
we're
going
to
give
women
and
minorities
special
consideration.
there
was
no
countervailing
balance
to
say:
well,
wait
a
minute;
you
have
other
employees
with
this
agency
with
civil
rights
and
they're
entitled
to
protection
also.
and
as
a
result,
whenever...
and
again,
we
don't
have
applicant
flow
data,
but
it
is
clear
that
as
a
matter
of
course
when
an
unprotected
employee
goes
up
for
promotion
with
a
protected
employee,
the
unprotected
employee
is
going
to
lose.
this
is
not
narrowly
tailoring.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
your
honor,
on
these
facts
i'd
have
to
say
yes,
because
already
we
have
women
actively
in
the
work
force.
they'll
be
in
line
for
promotions
in
a
relatively
short
period
of
time.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
i
think
that
once
you've
opened
the
doors
and
provided
for
equal
opportunity,
it's
appropriate
to
have
these
employees
moving
up
through
the
work
force
based
on
the
merit
system.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
in
the
absence
of--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--convincing
evidence,
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
your
honor,
i
think
that
the
reason
that
it
would
make
a
different
to
have
past
discrimination
is
because
we're
trying
to
achieve
a
reconciliation
between
the
protection
that
title
7
provides
for
individual
rights
and
the
recognized
need
to
promote
voluntary
compliance
and
to
achieve
the
purposes
of
title
7,
which
is
equal
opportunity,
and
to
make
people
whole
if
they
have
suffered
discrimination.
and
we
require
past
discrimination--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--the
weber
case...
yes,
the
weber
case
had
evidence
of
past
discrimination.
and
in
this
case
we
had
no
evidence,
and
indeed
an
admission
in
the
plan
that
any
statistical
imbalances
were
attributed
to
societal
attitudes
and
to
traditional
norms.
and
it's
probably
not
a
good
thing
in
terms
of
society,
and
if
we
were
congress
perhaps
we
would
want
to
change
that.
but
again,
in
terms
of
bringing
women
into
the
work
force,
you
can't
force
them
into
the
non-traditional
jobs,
and
if
they
want
those
jobs
they
can
compete
on
merit,
especially
because
the
agency
has
made
effective
efforts
to
recruit
them
and
bring
them
into
the
work
force,
and
that
have
been
very
effective
in
the
first
five
years.
we
were
in
the
second
half
of
the
agency's
affirmative
action
program.
we
were
in
a
second
plan.
they
already
had
it
in
place
for
three
years
and
they
rewrote
it
at
the
time
that
the
petitioner
went
up
for
the
promotion.
i
think
that
there
are
a
lot
of
other
narrower
tailoring
aspects
to
the
plan
that
are
troublesome,
and
this
really
focuses
on
the
fact
that
we're
dealing
with
a
promotion
rather
than
hiring.
that
is,
the
plan
applied
employment
goals
and
doesn't
take
into
account
that
there
might
be
other,
less
intrusive
measures
to
bring
women
into
the
work
force.
we
already
know
from
the
plan...
and
indeed
we're
not
challenging
many
aspects
of
this
plan
that
had
good
affirmative
action
programs.
we
are
challenging
the
application
of
an
employment
goal
that
applied
throughout
the
work
force.
and
i
think
there
are
some
aspects
of
the
plan
that
illustrate
how
difficult
it
was.
it's
a
broad
plan.
it
seeks
to
achieve
racial
and
sexual
parity
in
each
job
classification.
and
it
goes
into
substantial
detail
in
order
to
achieve
this
balance
for
every
ethnic
group,
by
filipinos
and
by
hispanics
and
by
asians.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
well,
your
honor,
this
is
just
in
case
you
were
to
find
that
there
was
an
adequate
remedial
purpose
based
solely
on
these
statistics.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
and
again,
we
think
that
that
should
not
be
enough,
and
especially
upon
the
facts
of
this
case.
there's
another
aspect
to
this.
if
this
court
were
to
find
that
mere
statistical
imbalance
justified
affirmative
action
employment
goals,
then
it
would
be
very
easy
for
an
employer
to
adopt
affirmative
action
without
having
any
incentive
to
protect
the
rights
of
the
other
employees.
and
this
basically
repeats
a
prima
facie
test
which
this
court
has
applied
for
title
7
plaintiffs
as
opposed
to
title
7
defendants.
because
the
employer
has
the
information
and
because
the
employer
has
a
dual
responsibility,
to
both
his
non-minority
and
his
minority
employees,
i
think
it
is
appropriate
to
require
more
of
the
employer.
but
we're
not
going
to
require
that
he
confess
liability.
it
has
to
be
somewhere
in
the
middle.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
no.
the
answer
is
yes,
he
may,
but
only
when
he
has
convincing
evidence
that
there's
a
remedial
purpose
and
he's
determined
that
an
employment
goal--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--yes,
but
i
think
that
the
latter
aspect
goes
to
the
tailoring
aspect.
when
you're
in
a
hiring
situation,
you're
able
to
diffuse
the
burden
that
you're
applying.
you
know,
you
have
a
pool
of
applicants
and
you're
looking
for--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--that's
absolutely
correct.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
no,
it
shouldn't
be.
we
need
more,
and
this
is
because
title
7
protects
all
employees
from
discrimination
in
employment
by
race
and
sex.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
the
first
answer...
there
are
a
number
of
answers.
i
think
the
first
is
this
court
limited
weber
to
public
employers.
but
that
really
begs
your
question.
i
think
the
second
answer
is
because
we're
not
able
to
diffuse--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--pardon?
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
oh,
i'm
sorry.
i
meant
weber
applied
only
to
private
and
we're
a
public
employer.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
well,
i
think
it
begs
your
question
because
you
can
always
extend
weber
to
a
public
employer.
[laughter]
i
think
that
there
are...
i
didn't
mean
to
make
a
joke.
that's
within
your
power.
but
i
think
there's
a
more
important
distinction,
because
in
weber
you
were
able
to
diffuse
the
burdens.
weber
dealt
with
a
new
training
program
that
benefited
both
black
and
white
employees,
and
everyone
was
going
to
have
something
new
and
you
didn't
have
the
kind
of
expectations
that
have
been
developed
in
the
work
force.
whereas
in
this
case
you
had
a
relatively
small
county
work
force.
you
had
low
turnover,
which
is
in
the
face
of
the
plan.
you
had
employees
with
certain
promotion
expectations,
that
if
they
worked
hard
they'd
be
judged
on
merit.
and
again,
to
apply
affirmative
action
in
this
case
without
being
sure
that
you
have
convincing
evidence
of
a
remedial
purpose
and
that
you
can
narrowly
limit
your
application,
you
simply
can't
do
that.
here
it
would
fall
entirely
on
the
petitioner's
shoulders,
and
it
did.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
answers
to
that.
first,
in
undergoing
a
process
before
adopting
the
affirmative
action
program,
the
employer
is
able
to
have
evidence,
a
process
that
he
went
through
and
to
be
able
to
come
forward.
so
it
immediately
takes
him
off
the
really
dangerous
point
in
the
tightrope.
he's
got
some
protection.
but
in
doing
the
evidentiary
process
to
develop
a
basis
for
your
plan,
the
employer
is
not
necessarily
required
to
prove
to
a
certainly
that
he's
discriminated.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
exactly.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
but
i
think
that
that's
necessary.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
well,
your
honor,
no
person
may
not
be
able
to
do
it,
but
title
7
says
that
you
cannot
discriminate
against
your
employees.
and
you
have
to
have
some
kind
of
credible
basis.
that
was
the
holding
in
wygant.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
the
kind
of
evidence
that
we're
talking
about...
and
again,
this
is
only
some
ideas...
would
be
to
look
at
the
statistics
and
give
a
careful
scrutiny
to
the
statistics.
in
this
case,
the
agency
used
the
wrong
relevant
labor
market.
as
justice
o'connor
pointed
out,
they
never
even
looked
at
the
real
relevant
labor
market.
and
in
fact,
it's
very
interesting,
because
this
issue
came
up
when
they
rewrote
their
plan
in
1978
and
the
director
testified
at
trial.
well,
someone
raised
it,
but
we
really
never
got
too
far.
so
first
of
all,
what
we're
asking
for
is
a
statistical
scrutiny,
which
by
itself
should
not
expose
the
employer.
second,
he
looks
for
some
kind
of
explanation
for
these
statistics
other
than
discrimination.
this
is
a
process
that
he
would
ordinarily
go
through
in
defending
a
title
7
case.
i
think
it's
an
appropriate
process
just
as
an
employer.
it's
not
burdensome,
and
if
he
finds
that
there's
discrimination
and
he
looks
for
other
corroborative
evidence
it
doesn't
have
to
be
specific
acts.
but
we're
talking
about
sort
of
a
minimal
effort
to
ensure
that
when
you've
got
a
plan,
you've
got
a
good
basis
for
that
plan.
and
by
even
doing
this
minimal
effort,
you're
in
a
much
better
position
to
identify
what
you
need
to
remedy
and
how
to
remedy
it.
it's
a
process.
it
has
an
underlying
substance.
but
i
don't
think
that
employers
would
necessarily
be
discouraged
from
doing
that.
and
it's
got...
and
again,
in
order
to
protect
people
like
petitioner,
who
otherwise
do
have
their
rights
lost,
the
employer
has
to
do
something
more
than
just
throw
out
statistics.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
i
think
if
you're
a
title
7
case...
title
7
plaintiff,
excuse
me,
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
that
that
is
a
prima
facie
case.
but
again,
and
i
think
this
is
a
question--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--okay.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
the
prevailing
law
is--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--then
that
would
be
denied,
your
honor,
because
statistical
imbalances,
if
there's
no
explanation,
do
establish
a
case.
and
that
really
was,
i
believe,
judge
wallace's
dissent.
and
we
think
that
it
was
a
very
good
point,
which
is
when
an
employer
has
developed
an
affirmative
action
plan
and
is
going
forward
to
discriminate
against
non-minority
employees
pursuant
to
that
plan,
he's
not
asserting
a
non-discriminatory
reason.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
the
employer
can
come
forward
with
a
number
of
explanations,
and
particularly
i
believe
this
court
held
in
the
cooper
case
that
you
can
explain
the
statistical
imbalance
my
reasons
other
than
no
discrimination.
again,
in
wygant
this
court
held
that
mere
past
history
of
racial
discrimination
is
not
enough.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
yes,
and
that's
precisely--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--oh,
i'm
sorry.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
and
that's
exactly
why
having
the
employer
consider
statistical
imbalances
and
look
for
explanations
and
then
take
a
remedy
before
he
gets
sued
would
solve
the
problem.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
no,
i
don't
think
we
gave
away
our
case
at
all,
because
here
the
agency
never
did
that
kind
of
a
process.
the
agency
never
considered
other
explanations,
and
we
raised
those
other
explanations
in
the
trial.
we
showed
that
women
were
not
applying--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--the
agency
has
claimed
that
they
would.
i
don't
think
that
they
would
on
these
facts,
because
the
plan
shows
that
the
lack
of
women
was
attitudinal
and
that
the
agency
was
affirmatively
hiring.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
i
just
have
a
few
points
to
respond
to.
i
think
that
the
facts
of
this
case
show
why
we
would
suggest
that
an
employer
has
to
show
more
than
a
prima
facie
case
before
he
adopts
a
voluntary
affirmative
action
plan.
and
by
a
prima
facie
case,
i'm
talking
about
a
naked
statistical
balance,
because
here
the
agency
clearly
never
went
behind
and
considered
whether
no
women
had
ever
applied.
it's
not
quite
correct
to
say
that
petitioner
didn't
ask
for
applicant
flow
data.
it
was
requested
during
discovery
and
we
were
told
it
wasn't
available
because
the
county
never
got
the
computer
program.
that's
really
not
here
or
there,
but
i
do
want
to
make
it
clear
that
we
did
look
for
applicant
flow
data
and
were
told
it
just
wasn't
available.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
we
don't
agree
that
the
employer
would
have
been
justified
in
preferring
the
woman,
because
if
you
look
at
the
road
dispatcher
job
you
had
20
percent
of
the
employees,
3
out
of
18,
were
already
women
at
the
time.
so
the
plan
should
never
have
applied.
but
if
you
look
at
the
plan
in
general,
the
fact
that
they
never
looked
for
a
relevant
labor
market
goes
to
the
overall
crudity
of
the
affirmative
action
plan.
you
don't
have
an
employer
here
who
made
a
good
faith
effort
to
develop
a
plan.
you
have
an
employer
who
basically
looked
at
the
overall
population,
slapped
some
number
in,
and
then
went
forward,
again
without
taking
into
account
the
rights
of
the
other
employees.
that's
why
it's
relevant,
because
this
plan
is
facially
discriminatory
with
respect
to
all
of
the
unprotected
employees.
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
not
in
this
case,
because
there
are
other
explanations
for
the
statistical
disparity.
and
in
fact,
you
find
these
in
the
county's
own
documents.
they
admit
that
they
attribute
the
lack
of
women
here
not
to
"past
discrimination";
they
attribute
it
to
societal
attitudes.
and
i
don't
think
that
this
court
has
ever
held
that
women
will
necessarily
occupy
the
same
jobs
in
direct
proportion
to
their
representation
in
the
working
force.
i
think
it's
rather
obvious
that
women
and
men
prefer
things
differently.
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
always
good,
but
attitudes
based
on
sex
are
different.
and
i
think
it's
an
important
factor
here
that
you
have
women
applying
for
non-traditional
jobs
in
the
transit
agency
and
getting
them.
you
had
extensive
hiring
in
terms
of
women
bus
drivers
and
women
utility
workers,
which
was
the
position
below
becoming
a
mechanic.
i
think
what
you
have
here
is
an
explained
statistical
disparity
in
that
women
were
going
into
other
jobs
and
choosing
not
to
work
for
the
roads
division,
where
you
had
fewer
openings
and
less
future
opportunity
for
advancement.
but
we
don't
know,
because
this
agency
never
looked
and
never
considered
other
alternatives
than
their
assumption
that
they
discriminated.
and
we
say
that's
wrong
and
that's
why
you
should
have
more
than
just
a
prima
facie
case
when
we
talk
about
convincing
evidence
that
it
is
appropriate
to
go
into
a
voluntary
affirmative
action
plan.
i
think
there's
another
factor
here--
ms.
constance
e.
brooks
--thank
you
very
much.
