justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
this
case
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit.
the
question
for
decision
is
the
validity
of
an
affirmative
action
plan
adopted
by
an
agency
of
santa
clara
county,
california,
respondents,
santa
clara
county
transportation
agency.
the
plan
provides,
among
many
other
things,
in
making
promotions
to
positions
within
a
traditionally
segregated
job
classification,
in
which
women
have
been
significantly
under
represented,
the
agency
has
authorized
to
consider
as
one
factor
the
sex
of
a
qualified
applicant.
the
plan
is
intended
to
achieve
or
statistically
measurable
year
to
work
improvement
in
hiring
and
promoting
minorities
and
women.
job
classification
were
they
are
under
represented.
the
long
term
goal
is
to
attain
a
work
force
whose
accomplization
reflects
the
proportion
of
the
minorities
and
women
in
the
area
labor
force.
the
plan
sets
aside
no
specific
number
of
positions
for
minorities
or
women,
but
requires
that
short-range
goals
be
established
and
annually
adjusted
to
serve
as
the
most
realistic
guide
for
actual
employment
decisions.
when
the
agency
announced
the
vacancy
for
the
promotional
position
of
road
dispatcher,
none
of
the
238
positions
in
the
pertinent
skilled
craft
worker
job
classification
which
included
the
dispatcher
position
was
held
by
a
woman.
the
qualified
applicants
for
the
positions
were
interviewed
and
the
agency,
pursuant
to
the
plan,
ultimately
passed
over
petitioner
a
male
employee
and
promoted
a
female,
diane
joyce,
both
of
the
whom
were
rated
as
well
qualified
for
the
job.
after
receiving
a
right
to
sue
letter
from
the
euqal
employment
opportunity
commission,
petitioner
files
suit
in
federal
district
court,
which
held
that
the
agency
plan
violated
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964.
the
court
found
that
joyce's
sex
was
a
determining
factor
in
her
selection
and
that
the
agency's
plan
was
invalid
under
the
criterion
announced
in
our
decision
in
steelworkers
versus
weber
that
the
plan
be
temporary.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
ninth
circuit
reversed
the
district
court,
and
we
intern
agreeing
with
the
court
of
appeals
affirm
its
judgment.
we
hold
that
the
agent
appropriately
took
into
our
account
joyce's
sex
as
one
factor
in
determining
that
she
should
be
promoted.
the
agency's
plan
represents
a
moderate,
flexible,
case-by-case
approach
effecting
a
gradual
improvement
in
the
representation
of
minorities
and
women
in
the
agency's
work
force,
and
is
therefore
fully
consistent
with
title
vii.
assessment
of
the
legality
of
the
agency's
plan
must
be
guided
by
the
decisions
in
steelworkers
versus
weber.
an
employer
seeking
to
justify
the
adoption
of
an
affirmative
action
plan
need
not
point
to
its
own
prior
discriminatory
practices
but
need
point
only
to
our
conspicuous
imbalance
in
traditionally
segregated
job
categories.
voluntary
employer
action
can
play
a
crucial
role
in
furthering
title
vii's
purpose
of
eliminating
the
effects
of
discrimination
in
the
workplace
and
title
vii
should
not
be
read
to
thwart
such
efforts.
the
employment
decision
here
was
made
pursuant
to
a
plan
prompted
by
concerns
similar
to
those
of
the
employer
in
webber,
consideration
of
the
sex
of
applicants
for
skilled
craft
jobs
was
justified
by
the
existence
of
a
manifest
imbalance
that
reflected
under
representation
of
women,
in
traditionally
segregated
job
categories.
