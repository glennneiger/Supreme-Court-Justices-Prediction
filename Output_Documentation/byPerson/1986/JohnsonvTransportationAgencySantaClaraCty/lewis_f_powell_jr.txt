justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--i
was
under
the
impression
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
had
never
been
any
discrimination
against
women
by
the
agency
and
that
none
was
occurring
at
the
time
of
trial.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
did
make
that
finding?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
court
of
appeals
hold
it
clearly
erroneous?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
you
rely
solely
on
the
statistics?
