do
you
agree
that
if
the
employer
has
a
firm
basis
for
believing
remedial
action
is
necessary,
because
otherwise
the
employer
is
likely
to
be
subject
to
some
action
against
the
employer
under
title
7,
that
that
justifies
or
can
justify
taking
affirmative
action?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
here
there
was
a
category
of
skilled
positions.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
totaling
what,
278
or
so?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
238.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
none
of
which
were
occupied
by
women.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
that
is
not
enough
for
the
employer
to
think
that
there
might
be
a
firm
basis
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
evidence...
or
what
is
the
evidence
in
the
record
as
to
the
percentage
of
qualified
women
in
the
labor
pool
for
these
positions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
goal
that
the
employer
set
was
only
five
percent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
the
goal
on
which
we
have
to
test
this
case?
we
have
to
compare
it
with
the
36
percent
or
with
the
5
percent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
employer
knows
that
no
woman
has
ever
applied
for
any
of
these
jobs,
that
it's
just
the
kind
of
job
that
for
some
reason
women
in
that
area
have
not
applied
for?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
something
the
employer
must
weigh
in
addition
to
statistics?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
who's
going
to
know
if
the
employer
doesn't?
presumably,
the
employer
is
the
one
that
receives
job
applications.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
don't
we
have
to
accept
the
findings
as
they
come
to
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
you
clarify
for
me
what
the
affirmative
action
plan
consisted
of?
was
it
a
plan
to
be
geared
to
the
percentage
of
women
in
the
countywide
work
force
for
every
kind
of
position?
or
was
it
geared
to
the
number
of
women
qualified
for
these
technical
jobs
in
this
particular
category?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
concede,
then,
that
this
employer
affirmative
action
plan
was
not
geared
to
the
number
of
qualified
women
in
the
pool
of
labor?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
we
find
that?
i
confess
that
it
was
difficult
for
me
in
these
opinions
to
know
what
it
was
that
the
affirmative
action
plan
really
consisted
of
in
that
regard
as
applied
to
these
jobs.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
in
the
appendix
someplace?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
would
i
find
it?
is
it
in
the
appendix?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
don't
take
your
argument
time.
i
want
to
know
where
i
can
find
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
brooks,
is
it
your
position
that
the
county
as
an
employer
can
set
an
affirmative
action
plan
goal
that
is
geared
to
the
number
of
women
in
the
labor
force
in
the
county
generally,
as
opposed
to
the
number
of
qualified
women
in
the
available
pool?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
an
affirmative
action
plan
geared
to
the
larger
percentage
is
valid?
