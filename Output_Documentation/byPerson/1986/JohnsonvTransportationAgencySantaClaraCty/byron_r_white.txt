justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
a
statistical
imbalance
in
the
work
force
is
evident
and
the
adopt
an
affirmative
action
plan,
isn't
it
apparent
on
its
face
that
its
remedial
in
the
sense
they're
trying
to
remedy
the
imbalance?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
say
just
statistical
imbalance
will
never
justify
by
itself
an
affirmative
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
else
was
there
in
weber?
justice
byron
r.
white
beyond
an
imbalance?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
in
weber
the
plan
adopted
was
to
remedy
past
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
a
promotion
is
involved
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
hire?
do
you
think
an
employer
may
adopt
a
race
conscious
hiring
policy,
establish
a
goal
of
three
to
one
or
two
to
one--
justice
byron
r.
white
--just
because
he
wants
to?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would
make
the
same
argument
with
respect
to
a
hiring
goal?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
nevertheless
would
say
that
just
because
the
employer
wants
to
isn't
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
just
because
there's
a
racial
imbalance
isn't
enough.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
would
you
say
the
prevailing
law
is
or
was
in
the
lower
courts
with
respect
to
whether
racial
imbalance
alone
would
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
under
title
7?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
if
you're
just
a
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
not
the
plaintiff
but
what
about--
justice
byron
r.
white
--the
plaintiff
gets
through
with
his
case
or
her
case
and
the
only
proof
is
racial
imbalance,
and
there's
a
motion
to
dismiss.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
that
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case
in
a
title
7
case,
just
racial
imbalance,
what's
the
employer
then...
how
can
he
win
the
case?
by
proving
there
isn't
racial
imbalance
or
proving
that,
what,
there
is
no
racial
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
employer
who
has
a
racially
imbalanced
work
force
asks
his
attorney,
if
i
am
sued...
he
says
there's
a
racially
imbalanced
work
force
and
it
would
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
a
title
7
suit.
should
i
do
something
about
it
or
should
i--
justice
byron
r.
white
--no,
wait
a
minute.
justice
byron
r.
white
should
i
also
ask
you
what
are
the
chances
of
the
plaintiff
winning?
you
look
around
and
do
you
think
that
i
might
lose
a
title
7
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
just
give
away
your
case
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
it
never
asked,
might
i
lose
a
title
7
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
now
you're
putting
some
other
facts
in
the
question.
let's
just
stick
to
a
racial
imbalance.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
think
that
just
regularly
in
the
district
courts
that
evidence
would
survive?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
it
would
not
mean
that
the
employer
would
necessarily
lose
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
but
you
think
the
employer
should
not
only...
shouldn't
adopt
a
policy
just
based
on
racial
imbalance,
but
that
he
should
say,
have
i
got
a
good
chance
of
actually
losing
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
means
just
racial
imbalance.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
needn't
go
on
and
say,
well,
i
think
i
can
still
win
because
i
have
a
neutral
explanation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
forget
these
facts.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
employer
need
not
go
on
and
say
that
i
do
or
i
don't
have
a
neutral
explanation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
not
only
considered
it;
he
did
promote
a
less
qualified
woman
over
a
better
qualified
man.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
the
case
we're...
that's
the
case
that's
now
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
could
i
ask
you
what
you
think
that
our
cases
last
term
held
with
respect
to
what
circumstances
justify
giving
relief
to
a
non-victim?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
our
cases
said
that
the
circumstances
must
evidence
particularly
egregious
instances
of
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
wouldn't
suggest
that
there
was
any
evidence
here
of
egregious
discrimination,
would
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
lady
who,
the
woman
who
was
promoted,
was
not
a
victim
of
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
course,
if
that
were
the
case
none
of
you
would
really
be
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
sounds
like
you're
saying
that
any
time
an
employer
wants
to
adopt
a
race
conscious
hiring
or
promotion
policy,
that
should
be
permitted?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
thinks
it's
fair;
that's
what
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
thinks
it
would
be
in
his
best
interest;
that's
what
you
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you're
adding
something
in
the
balance
besides
a
racial
imbalance.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
i
ask,
did
you
say
that
some
goals
have
been
refined
to
say
five
or
six
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
what,
these
skilled
category
jobs?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
that
prior
to
the
adoption
of
your
plan
you
had
looked
around
and
you
had
said,
well,
there's
30
percent
of
women
in
the
work
force
in
the
county,
but
we
only
have
six
percent
in
these
jobs.
there's
really
a
statistically
significant
imbalance.
now,
under
your
argument
i
take
it
they
could
have
adopted
this
affirmative
action
plan
and
carried
it
out,
except
that
one
of
these
days
you
really
discover
that
you
made
a
mistake,
it
should
have
only
been...
five
or
six
percent
is
plenty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
even
though
that
would
make
out
a
prima
facie
case
of
employment
discrimination?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
no.
under
your
view
of
the
law,
the
plaintiff,
all
he
would
have
to
do
is
to
show
that
imbalance,
and
that
would
survive
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
then
the
employer
would
have
to
prove
no
discrimination.
