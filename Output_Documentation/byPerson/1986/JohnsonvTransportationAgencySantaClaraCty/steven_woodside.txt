mr.
steven
woodside
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
answering
the
questions
that
justice
white
just
posed
and
to
tell
you
what
my
advice
to
my
clients
would
have
been
under
these
circumstances.
with
no
women
out
of
238
skilled
craft
workers,
with
only
one
woman
working
on
the
road
crews,
with
evidence
of
practices...
the
job
descriptions
were
male-oriented
only
and
specifically
stated
that
these
jobs--
mr.
steven
woodside
--very
well,
your
honor.
with
those
statistics
of
no
women
in
the
skilled
craft
work
force
and
only
one
woman
out
of
110
road
workers,
i
think
there
would
clearly
be
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
steven
woodside
a
motion
to
dismiss?
absolutely,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
woodside
it
would
not
mean
that
the
employer
would
necessarily
lose.
we
would
have
to...
we
would
have
then
the
burden
of
articulating
non-discriminatory
reasons
for
this
particular
imbalance.
and
i
think
on
the
facts
of
this
case
which
are
in
this
record,
we
would
have
not
been
able
to
meet
that
burden.
mr.
steven
woodside
no,
i
believe
that
if
there
is
evidence
of
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
that
that's
enough
for
an
employer
to
consider.
mr.
steven
woodside
that
means
racial
imbalance,
that's
right.
mr.
steven
woodside
well,
as
i
tried
to
make
clear
with
the
facts
of
this
case--
mr.
steven
woodside
--right.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
think
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
is
that
these
kinds
of
statistical
imbalances
put
the
employer
between
the
rock
and
the
hard
place
that
justice
scalia
referred
to
earlier.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
think
that
would
be
a--
mr.
steven
woodside
--i
don't
think
it's
required
that
the
employer
must
weigh
that.
but
your
question
suggests
that
if
the
employer
knew
that
factor;
i
think
that
would
make
it
a
much
closer
case.
that
factor
is
not
present
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
woodside
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
given
the
liberal
rules
of
discovery,
in
this
case
had
the
petitioner
sought
to
pursue
that
line
of
inquiry
it
could,
petitioner
could
have
done
so.
it
was
not
pursued,
and
indeed
the
question
of--
mr.
steven
woodside
--i
think
that's
correct,
given
those
limited
facts
and
the
limited
hypothetical
that
justice
o'connor
has--
mr.
steven
woodside
--yes.
mr.
steven
woodside
that,
your
honor,
was
not
a
litigated
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
steven
woodside
the
district
court
judge
did
make
that
finding.
mr.
steven
woodside
no,
the
court
of
appeals
did
not
hold
that
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
rely
on
the
statistics,
as
well
as
evidence
of
other
practices.
and
i
think
that
finding
of
no
discrimination
was
the
wrong
finding
to
be
entered
in
such
a
case.
the
relevant
inquiry,
it
seems
to
me,
should
be
whether
or
not
the
employer
believed
and
had
a
firm
basis
to
conclude
that
it
may
have
discriminated
against
women,
based
on
its
own
knowledge
of
the
statistics.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
your
honor,
you
do.
and
i'm
not
suggesting
that
that
finding
be
reversed
as
clearly
erroneous.
but
i
think
it
was
not
one
which
was
litigated.
there
was
nobody
at
the
trial
court
pointing
the
finger
at
the
transportation
agency
and
saying:
you
in
fact
discriminated
against
women.
that
was
not
litigated.
i
certainly
was
not
going
to
stand
up
and
concede
discrimination
against
women.
mr.
steven
woodside
it
actually
has
elements
of
both,
your
honor.
there
was
a
general
overall
goal
set
forth
in
the
1978
plan
that
for
each
job
and
each
job
category
the
goal
would
be
that
all
job
categories
would
be
comprised
of
women,
minorities,
and
others
approximately
in
proportion
to
their
numbers
in
the
county
labor
pool.
mr.
steven
woodside
no,
your
honor,
i
don't
concede
that,
because
the
next
step
and
probably
the
most
important
step
in
our
plan,
is
that
after
those
overall
goals
were
set
the
plan
further
requires
that
specific
goals
be
thereafter
set
for
individual
jobs,
such
as
skilled
crafts.
and
your
honor
correctly
pointed
out
that
there
was
a
goal
set
for
skilled
crafts
of
only
three
women
out
of
55
expected
new
hires
in
1983.
mr.
steven
woodside
the
agency's
goal
is
contained
in
the
1982
plan.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
it
is.
mr.
steven
woodside
it
is
in
the
joint
appendix
and
it
is
cited.
the
specific
reference
is
cited
in
our
brief,
your
honor.
that
specific
goal
of
three
out
of
55
was
the
goal
for
the
skilled
craft
jobs.
mr.
steven
woodside
there
was
at
that
time
no
specific
goal
for
skilled
crafts.
mr.
steven
woodside
they
were
using
the
countywide
pool
as
a
reference--
mr.
steven
woodside
--the
long
term
goal
was
36.4
percent.
mr.
steven
woodside
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor,
because
i--
mr.
steven
woodside
--he
is,
your
honor.
but
the
plan
does
more
than
simply
state
there
shall
be
a
fixed
number
of
women
in
any
particular
job.
the
plan
sets
absolutely
no
quota.
the
plan
establishes
no
fixed
preference.
it
simply
says,
given
those
numbers,
the
director
of
the
agency
should
give
consideration
to
that
disparity,
the
absence
of
women
for
example,
in
making
hiring
and
promotion
decisions.
mr.
steven
woodside
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
that
is
the
long
term
goal,
that
is
the
long
term
goal.
mr.
steven
woodside
quota?
no,
there
was
no
quota.
mr.
steven
woodside
long
term
goal,
yes.
i
think
it's
important,
your
honor,
that
the
long
term
goal,
which
was
later
refined
to
be
more
specific
for
women
in
skilled
crafts,
that
long
term
goal
did
not
require
any
fixed
preference
to
be
given.
indeed,
everyone
who
wished
a
promotion
could
compete
for
a
promotion.
unlike
what
the
petitioner's
counsel
has
just
said
earlier,
there
is
no
evidence
to
indicate
that
in
every
case
women
would
get
the
promotion.
indeed,
the
facts
are
to
the
contrary.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
your
honor.
now,
in
this
case
i
think
the
reason
why
that
is
valid
is
that
under
the
case
law
decided
by
this
court
one
would
ordinarily
expect
in
jobs
throughout
an
agency
that
they
would
be
comprised,
absent
discrimination,
of
roughly
their
numbers
that
exist
in
the
general
labor
pool.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
think
that
there
would
be
an
inference
of
discrimination
drawn
from
that
factor
alone.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
think
it
is
based
on
both
human
experience
and
governmental
policy.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
women
do
seek
these
jobs--
mr.
steven
woodside
--yes.
if
i
may,
your
honor,
the
suggestion
that's
made
by
the
petitioner's
counsel,
for
the
first
time
in
this
case,
is
that
the
relevant
labor
pool
was
seven
percent
or
five
percent
as
she
stated
in
the
reply
brief.
if
that
is
the
case...
and
it's
too
bad
that
that
was
not
litigated
at
trial
or
not
even
mentioned
at
the
court
of
appeals.
but
if
that
is
the
case,
then
it's
clear
from
those
numbers
alone
that
there
would
have
been
a
case
of
discrimination
against
the
agency.
the
difference
between
zero,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
and
five
percent
or
seven
percent
or
any
of
the
higher
figures
makes
us
vulnerable
to
a
charge
of
discrimination
and
gives
us
good
cause,
it
seems
to
me,
to
take
remedial
action.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
don't
think
i
would
say
you
can
immediately
begin
to
discriminate.
the
plan
says
that
that
fact
should
be
considered
in
the
hiring
and
promotion
decisions.
it
should
be
considered.
it's
not
necessarily
determinative.
and
at
the
time
of
this
decision,
there
were
absolutely
no
women
in
the
skilled
craft
jobs.
those
were
the
facts
known
to
the
agency
director
at
the
time,
and
that
was
the
basis
upon
which
he
made
his
decision.
mr.
steven
woodside
well,
the
district
court
did
make
that
finding
with
respect
to
qualification.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
your
honor.
but
i
would
point
out
that
the
agency
director
testified
that
in
his
view
they
were
equally
qualified.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
think
that
your
cases
held
that
in
the
context
of
the
problem
that
we
have
here
is
that
where
there
is
a
firm
basis
upon
which
an
employer
can
infer
that
its
own
practices
may
have
been
discriminatory,
then
the
employer
can
voluntarily
take
affirmative
action
which
is
not
victim-specific.
and
i
would
cite
primarily
the
wygant
case
for
that
proposition.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
don't
think
the
case
law
says
it
has
to
be
particularly
egregious.
i
think
the
case
law
suggests
that
where
there
are
facts
that
suggest
there
would
be
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination,
the
employer
can
voluntarily
embark
on
an
affirmative
action
course.
mr.
steven
woodside
there
was
no
such
finding,
your
honor.
but
there
was...
and
i
think
it's
important
to
remember
that
the
statistics
were
buttressed
at
trial
by
evidence
of
the
agency's
own
practices.
mr.
steven
woodside
well,
the
district
court
made
one
finding
that's
interesting.
he
suggested
that
one
of
the
interview
panelists
may
have
had
discriminatory
intent
against
her
because
she
was
a
woman,
but
that
that
by
itself
did
not
justify
the
action
taken.
so
i
think
even
the
district
court
judge
conceded
that
under
the
facts
presented
here
there
was
evidence
that
she
may
have
been
deterred
and
in
fact--
mr.
steven
woodside
--if
the
district
judge
had
made
the
finding
that
she
had
in
fact
been
discriminated
against,
yes,
i
think
you're
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
think
that--
mr.
steven
woodside
--if
those
differences
that
you
describe
are
statistically
significant,
in
other
words
if
the
difference
between--
mr.
steven
woodside
--i
think
that
raises
the
question
as
to
whether
or
not
the
practices
in
the
agency
itself
have
been
fair
toward
women.
and
under
our
practice--
mr.
steven
woodside
--i
understood
your
earlier
question
to
mean
that
any
time
there
is
a
disparity
between
the
work
force
and
the
labor
market
generally,
would
that
constitute
a
prima
facie
case
of
discrimination?
my
answer
to
that
is
yes.
mr.
steven
woodside
that's
right,
and
it
would
be
up
to
the
petitioner
to
prove
that
there
is
an
alternative
explanation
for
those
statistical
imbalances.
mr.
steven
woodside
no,
they--
mr.
steven
woodside
--but
against
the
challenge,
it
would
be
up
to
the
petitioner
to
prove
that
it
would
be
reasonable
to
have
no
women
in
the
skilled
craft
category.
and
there
was
not
a
shred
of
evidence--
mr.
steven
woodside
--the
plan
set
a
long
term
goal.
i
want
to
emphasize
that.
it
set
a
long
term
goal.
the
factors
that
the
agency
director
cited
when
he
made
the
decision
was
the
absence
of
women
in
the
skilled
craft
category.
that's
really
the
salient
fact
in
this
case.
we
don't
have
before
the
court
the
case
where
there
were
several
women
in
the
job
and
it
was
another
promotion
down
the
line
that
was
at
issue.
the
strong
point
in
the
agency's
plan
here
is
that
calls
for
a
case
by
case
review
in
hiring
and
promotion
to
look
at
the
statistics
as
you
find
them
at
that
point
in
time.
and
to
me
the
very
important
factor
in
this
case
is
that
this
was
the
first
time
a
woman
got
a
skilled
craft
job,
and
she
didn't
get
it
because
there
was
a
quota.
she
got
it
because
there
was--
mr.
steven
woodside
--she
was
certainly
well
qualified
and,
as
the
district
court
judge
found--
mr.
steven
woodside
--after
her
promotion?
i
can
cite
to
you
some
record
statistics
that
between
1978
and
1982
there
was
an
increase
of
111
skilled
craft
workers,
and
of
those
111
additional
jobs
6
were
women.
so
she
was
the
first
and
there
were
five
more
out
of
another
110.
so
this
was
not
the
kind
of
plan
where
the
agency
gave,
as
has
been
suggested,
an
automatic
preference
for
women.
it
simply
did
not
occur
here.
the
agency's
action
was
moderate
and
it
was
handled
on
a
case
by
case
basis,
given
the
facts
known
at
the
time
of
each
decision.
and
that's
a
fluid
situation,
i
would
submit,
because
as
we
learned
more
about
this
job
and
looked
at
it
more
closely
the
goal
for
the
job
was
refined
to,
incidentally,
between
five
and
six
percent
women
to
be
hired
for
the
expected
new
openings.
mr.
steven
woodside
oh,
it's
not
the
only
reason,
your
honor.
she
was--
mr.
steven
woodside
--that
became
the
decisive
factor.
if
i
can
explain,
the
county's
rules
require
that
hiring
or
promotion
decisions
be
made
from
a
list,
a
civil
service
list,
of
the
top
seven
applicants
for
the
job.
she
was
one
of
those
top
seven
applicants.
and
if
there
was
nothing
said
about
sex
in
this
case,
any
of
those
top
seven
could
have
been
appointed.
and
i
would
submit,
if
the
agency
director
had
just
simply
said,
i
liked
her
better,
and
appointed
her,
that
would
probably
be
the
end
of
it.
but
it
is
clear--
mr.
steven
woodside
--well,
he
did
state
that
that
became
a
factor
in
the
decisionmaking
process.
mr.
steven
woodside
apparently
she
was
out
even
before
the
second
round
of
interviews,
according
to
her
testimony.
mr.
johnson
apparently
had
the
inside
track.
mr.
steven
woodside
well,
what
i'm
trying
to
say,
your
honor,
is
that
there
is
no
automatic
preference
to
be
accorded
women.
these
cases
are
to
be--
mr.
steven
woodside
--on
these
facts,
i
do
not
think
that
would
be
a
violation.
i'm
trying
to
illustrate--
mr.
steven
woodside
--that's
correct,
and
i
think
this
case
is
more
subtle.
i
think
this
case
involves,
as
i
stated
earlier,
a
case
by
case
review
of
employment
decisions.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
think
you
could
summarize
it
that
way,
your
honor.
but
i
would
not
want
to
omit
the
fact
that
ms.
joyce
also
competed
for
this
job.
ms.
joyce
in
1974
applied
for
the
road
dispatcher
job.
she
was
told
at
the
time
that
she
was
not
qualified.
she
then
went
and
worked
on
the
road
crews
themselves
for
five
years,
which
incidentally
was
twice
as
long
as
mr.
johnson
did.
so
that
by
1980,
when
they
were
competing
head
to
head,
as
you
put
it,
both
of
them
were
well
qualified
to
perform
the
work.
and
the
scores
that
were
arrived
at
in
this
case
based
on
an
interview
alone,
without
a
test
of
formal
procedure,
show
them
to
be
but
two
points
apart.
mr.
steven
woodside
pardon?
mr.
steven
woodside
without
competing
with
anyone
else.
mr.
steven
woodside
on
an
acting
basis,
without
competing
with
anyone
for
that
job.
there's
no
question
but
that
there
are
competing
interests
here,
and
it
would
seem
to
be
that
this
court
would
want
to
allow
appointing
authorities
and
employers
throughout
the
country
to
make
decisions
which
they
believe
are
in
their
best
interests
and
are
fair
as
can
possibly
by
made
to
all
concerned.
in
this
case
a--
mr.
steven
woodside
--no,
i'm
not
saying
that,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
woodside
no.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
think
because
of
the
statistics
that
were
in
this
case
and
because
of
the
evidence
of
practices
that
women
had
been
excluded
from
training
opportunities
in
the
past,
that
the
agency
had
refused
to
hire
pregnant
women
and
the
like,
given
those
facts,
that
it's
permissible
to
engage
in--
mr.
steven
woodside
--yes,
but
i
believe
those
are
the
facts
here,
and
i
tried...
i
endeavored
to
answer
your
question
if
we
were
only
dealing
with
racial...
or
sex
imbalance.
but
i
think
there
is
more
in
this
case.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes.
mr.
steven
woodside
well,
i
think
it
was
done
for
the
good
of
the
work
force.
and
also,
there
was
an
effort
made
to
be
fair
in
the
way
this
plan
was
designed.
this
plan
was
not
designed
to
make...
to
have,
for
example,
as
was
discussed
in
the
case
earlier
this
morning,
a
one
for
one
hiring
quota.
it's
not
like
the
weber
plan,
which
stated
that
there
shall
be
a
50
percent
set-aside
for
black
workers
in
the
kaiser
plant.
this
case
called
for
a
case
by
case
consideration,
and
as
applied
it
meant
that
there
were
very
few
women
who
actually
benefited
from
the
affirmative
action
plan,
but
a
few
did.
and
we
think
that
that's
the
type
of
moderate,
sensible
approach
that
this
court
should
endorse.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
steven
woodside
i
understand,
and
that
would
be
a
harder,
much
closer
case,
your
honor.
but
i
think
the
facts
here
cannot
be
emphasized
any
greater
than
that
there
were
zero
women.
that's
the
real
important
factor
in
this
case.
i
think
this
case
illustrates
well
the
difficulty
that
employers,
public
or
private
alike,
have
in
meeting
their
obligations
under
title
7
to
both
prohibit
discriminatory
practices
on
the
one
hand
and
on
the
other
hand
to
really
try
to
effectuate
and
provide
remedies
where
lawyers
believe
discrimination
may
have
occurred.
i
think
we
have
the
facts
there
that
discrimination
may
have
occurred.
that
statement
was
made
in
the
1978
affirmative
action
plan,
and
i
think
the
agency
should
be
entitled
to
take
the
modest
steps
that
it
has
done.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes.
mr.
steven
woodside
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
in
the
question
that
you
have
asked,
the
absence
of
any
women
and
the
absence
of
women
applicants
may
not
answer
the
question
whether
or
not
there
has
been
discrimination.
it
may
be
that
the
employer's
own--
mr.
steven
woodside
--well,
if
it
were
shown
that
he
knew
there
was
absolutely
no
discrimination,
that
he
the
employer
knew
that--
mr.
steven
woodside
--i
don't
think
he
could--
mr.
steven
woodside
--well,
that's
the
difficulty.
under
the
hypothetical
that
justice
stevens
has
asked,
he's
suggesting
there
is
no
prima
facie
case
because--
mr.
steven
woodside
--then
he's
suggesting
further
that
the
explanation
for
that
imbalance
is
no
women
have
ever
applied.
and
what
i'm
saying--
mr.
steven
woodside
--yes.
mr.
steven
woodside
yes,
and
i
tried
to--
mr.
steven
woodside
--i'm
sorry.
[laughter]
the
closer--
mr.
steven
woodside
--i
have
nothing
further
to
add.
thank
you.
