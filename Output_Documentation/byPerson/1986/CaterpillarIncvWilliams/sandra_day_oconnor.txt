justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
skoning,
it
seems
to
me
that
you're
contending
that
this
contract
claim
is
preempted
because
it
violates
some
federal
labor
principle
of
exclusive
representation.
and
if
so,
that
may
be
raising
a
garmin
type
preemption
argument,
not
a
section
301
preemption.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
our
cases
such
as
j.i.
case
or
belknap
indicate
that
what
was
pleaded
here
is
necessarily
a
complaint
that
falls
under
section
301.
maybe
at
the
end
of
the
day
it
is
preempted
by
some
federal
labor
policy.
i
don't
know.
but
that
doesn't
maybe
answer
the
jurisdiction
question,
and
i'd
like
you
to
address
that.
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
you
missed
the
point
of
my
question.
i'm
not
sure
that
this
falls
within
301.
it
seems
to
me
the
thrust
of
your
argument
is
another
type
of
preemption.
justice
o'connor
mr.
wollett,
do
you
defend
the
ninth
circuit's
view
or
test
of
removability
as
being
kind
of
a
two-step
inquiry,
and
you
look
to
see
whether
there
is
a
federal
remedy
which
supplants?
