justice
white
what
was
the
allegation
about
the
promise?
was
it
that
they
were
promised
permanent
employment
as
salaried
employees?
justice
white
you
wouldn't
really
say
that...
suppose...
suppose
while
they
were...
before
the
plant
shut
down,
these
people
were
just
let
go;
they
were...
their
salaried
jobs
were
terminated,
and
they
were
just
let
go.
they
were
out
of
work.
and
they
brought
a
suit
in
the
state
court
suing
on
this
alleged
contract
for
permanent
employment.
you
certainly
wouldn't
say
that
their
rights
as
supervisors
were
governed
by
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
white
well,
how
does
the
fact
that
they
were
demoted
to
the...
to
the
bargaining
unit,
and
then
terminated,
how
do
those
facts
change
the
basis
for
their
claim?
justice
white
so?
justice
white
you're
arguing
that...
you're
arguing,
i
take
it,
that
the...
after
they
returned
to
the
bargaining
unit,
there
was
a
new
contract
negotiated.
and
your
argument
is
that...
that
their
rights
that
they
may
have
acquired
when
they
were
supervisory
employees
are
just
merged
into
the
collective
bargaining
contract;
is
that
it?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
you
say
in
this
case,
though,
that
the
rights
they
obtained
as
supervisory
are
governed
by
a
collective
bargaining
contract
executed
after
they
became
members
of
the
bargaining
unit?
justice
white
well,
it
does
involve
a
judgment
here
before
this
301
preemption
and
removability,
there
does
have
to
be
some
judgment
as
to
whether
or
not
these
claims
are
independent
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract
or
sufficiently
involved
in
it
that
there
is
preemption.
justice
white
then
that's--
justice
white
well,
i
think
we
judge
the
case
on
the
ground
that
the
promise
really
was
made.
they
were
promised
permanent
employment
as
salaried
employees.
justice
white
let's
just
accept
that.
justice
white
and
you
say...
and
i
suppose
then
that
when
they
were
returned
to
the
bargaining
unit,
and...
the
breach
occurred
then.
justice
white
what
if
there
had
been
no
attempt
to
remove,
but
the
company
had
just
moved
to
dismiss
the
case
in
the
state
court
on
the
same
ground
that
it
moved
to
dismiss
in
the
federal
court,
saying
that
this
is
governed
by
the
collective
bargaining
contract,
or
at
least
it's
arguably
covered
by
it,
and
it
should
be
decided
by
an
arbitrator,
and
you
really
haven't
satisfied
the
time
requirements?
what
would
have
been
your
response?
justice
white
well,
but
would
you
concede
that
if
your
contract
arguably
was
covered
by
the
bargaining
agreement,
that
your
claim
was
arguably
covered
by
the
bargaining
agreement,
that
it
should
be
decided
by
the
arbitrator,
whose
job
it
is
to
construe
a
contract?
justice
white
well,
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
no,
is
plain
no.
justice
white
you
sort
of
say
that
the
court
itself
should
construe
the
contract,
should
construe
the
collective
bargaining
contract?
justice
white
in
the
state
court
in
my
example,
because
if
the
state
court
construed
the
contract
to
cover
this
kind
of
a
claim,
you
would
be
out
of
court.
justice
white
because
then
it
would
be
completely
governed
by
federal
law,
and
the
provisions
of
the
contract
would
be
enforced
in
accordance
with
its
terms.
justice
white
not
federal
preemption.
it
just
says
that,
say...
well,
they
would
make
the
claim
that
this
is
governed
by
federal
law,
and
they
say
the
collective
bargaining
contract
governs
this
claim.
and
if
the
state
court
agreed
with
them,
you
would
be
out
of
court,
i
suppose.
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
well,
the
argument
is
here
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
did
cover
this
kind
of
a
claim,
even
a
claim
that
a
promise
to
a
supervisory
employee
had
been
breached.
justice
white
well,
that's
an
argument
about
the
meaning
and
reach
of
the
collective
bargaining
contract.
justice
white
well,
it
can
only
occur
if
it's
plain
enough
that
it
does.
