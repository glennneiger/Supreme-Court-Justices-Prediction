chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-526,
caterpillar
and
others
against
cecil
williams.
mr.
skoning,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
complaint
here,
mr.
skoning,
disavows
any
reliance
on
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
that
certainly
distinguishes
it
from
a
case
like
avco,
don't
you
think?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
about
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine?
chief
justice
rehnquist
has
any
case
of
ours
said
what
you
just
said
in
so
many
words?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
that's
a
new
proposition
you're
urging
on
us?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
he
says
he's
not
suing
for
any
of
that
in
his
complaint.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you
simply
reject
the
doctrines
of
this
court
that
the
plaintiff
is
master
of
his
own
complaint.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
you're
saying
that
they
haven't
pleaded
the
full
contract
that's
in
existence
between
the
parties?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
isn't
something
that
you...
that
you
can
raise
to
remove
a
case.
that's
clearly
a
matter
of
defense.
you
set
forth
the
contract
you
think
is
in
existence.
the
defendant
comes
in
and
says,
well,
no,
that's
not
the
contract;
there
were
a
lot
of
other
things
here.
but
that's
a
matter
of
defense,
which
isn't
considerable
on
removal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
skoning.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
wollett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wollett.
mr.
skoning,
you
have
five
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
skoning.
the
case
is
submitted.
