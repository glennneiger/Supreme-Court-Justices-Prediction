justice
stevens
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
they
were
alleging
that
the
side
agreement
that
was
made
when
they
were
in
management
capacity
specified
that
at
the
time
of
termination
that
each
of
you
would
receive
500
shares
of
stock,
something
that
would
normally
not
be
part
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
that's
all
they
allege.
and
then
you
had
the
same
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
rest.
you
say
that
would
also
be
merged
into
the--
justice
stevens
--what's
the
difference,
really?
they
claim
that
they
had
an
independent
promise,
independent
agreement.
is
it
the
nature
of
what
they
were
promised
that
makes
a
difference?
justice
stevens
they
get
something.
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
gives
them
something
at
the
time
of
termination,
but
they
say
it's
not
what
they
were
independently
promised.
why
can't
they
make
a
side
agreement
like
that
when
they're
in
a
management
capacity?
justice
stevens
you'd
say
that
the
stock
option
agreement
would
be
preempted
under
federal
law,
too?
justice
stevens
i
don't
mean
stock
option;
stock
promise
to
give
500
shares
when
he
retired.
they
just
can't
do
that
through
a
management
person
and
make
it
binding
if
the
management
person
later
joins
a
bargaining
unit,
is
your
position,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
i
think
it
is.
justice
stevens
time
of
severance,
right.
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
if
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
says,
this
supersedes
all
side
agreements
of
every
kind?
justice
stevens
well,
what
if
there's
language
in
the
agreement
that
says,
this
does
not
supersede
any
side
agreements?
then
it
clearly
wouldn't,
would
it?
justice
stevens
i
don't
think
they
argue
quite
that
broadly,
do
they?
don't
they
say
that,
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
alleged
state
law
contracts
dealt
with
the
same
subject
matter
as
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
namely
what
happens
on
severance
and
whether
you
have
a
right
to
stay
on?
i
don't
think
they
would
say
if
you
had
rented
a
house
from
them
or
something
like
that
during
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
that
would
be
preempted.
justice
stevens
i
just
thought
you
stated
their
position
much
more
broadly
than
they
did.
that's
all
i
was
suggesting.
