justice
scalia
--it's
purely
a
defensive
matter,
of
course.
your
defense
to
the...
to
the
individual
contract
claim
is
that
all
of
this
merged
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
that
is
indeed
a
federal
question.
but
i
thought
our
doctrine
was
quite
clear
that
the
mere
fact
that
you
have
a
federal
defense
doesn't
make
the
case
removable.
now
can
you
conceive
of
any
situation
in
which
there
would
be
a
section
301
preemption
defense
in
which
the
suit
would
not
be
removable?
if
this
one
is,
why
is
a
suit
not
always
removable
whenever
there
is
a
section
301
defense?
justice
scalia
excuse
me,
before
you
go
on.
justice
scalia
their
claim
does
not
depend
on
301
at
all.
they
are
claiming
that
they
have
a
state
ground
that's
quite
separate
from
301.
it's
your
defense
that
hangs
on
301.
justice
scalia
well,
you
may
be
right,
but
that's
a
defense.
they're
coming
in
saying,
i
have
a
state
cause
of
action.
you're
saying,
no
you
don't;
it's
been
preempted
by
301.
justice
scalia
you
may
be
right.
but
it's
still
a
defense,
and
it's
not
their
cause
of
action.
justice
scalia
even
if
they
had
said
in
their
complaint,
we
expressly
disavow
any
federal
cause
of
action.
we
are
simply
suing
for...
on
these
state
grounds.
there
are
no
federal
grounds
in
this
complaint.
justice
scalia
you
can't
bring
the
state
cause
of
action.
you're
just
not
able
to.
justice
scalia
how
do
we
decide
this?
why...
why
would
the
collective
bargaining
agent
be
bargaining
about
issues
they
probably
didn't
even
know
about?
and
especially
when
the
breach,
if
a
breach
occurred
at
all,
it
seems
to
me
is
when
they
were
returned
to
the
bargaining
unit
as
nonsalaried
employees
when
they
had
been
promised
permanent
employment,
they
claim,
as
salaried
employees?
why
would
that
be
implicated...
why
is
it
even
arguably
implicated
in
the
collective
bargaining
agreement?
justice
scalia
but
how
do
we
know
that
on
the
face
of
it?
i
mean,
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine.
what
troubles
me
about
your
response
to
justice
stevens,
is
that
you
really...
we
really
can't
tell
until
the
trial
proceeds
or
there's
something
further
than
the
complaint
at
least,
whether
or
not
the
stock
agreement
was
superseded
by
the
bargaining
agreement;
whether
the
bargaining
agreement
had
terms;
or
if
the
terms
weren't
expressed,
whether
it
was
understood
that
it
would
supersede
everything.
in
many
cases,
you
have
to
get
into
the
trial
to
figure
out
that.
and
you
have
to
determine
removal
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint.
how
can
we
tell
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint
whether
these
factors
are
met
or
not?
justice
scalia
not
necessarily.
all
we're
arguing
about
at
this
stage
is
where
these
questions
are
going
to
be
decided,
not
how
they're
going
to
be
decided,
but
simply
whether
the
state
court
will
get
the
first
shot
at
it.
justice
scalia
that's
always
the
case
where
you
have
a
federal
defense.
you
always
have
the
state
court
passing
on
a
question
which
it
is
appropriate
for
a
federal
court
to
decide.
