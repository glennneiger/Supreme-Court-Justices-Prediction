mr.
fritz
wollett
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
wanted
to
respond
to
justice
blackmun's
question
at
the
start
of
the
questioning
of
the
petitioners'
attorney.
the
answer
to
the
question
as
to
how
long
the
respondents
were
employed
in
management
positions
or
positions
outside
the
bargaining
unit
is
set
forth
in
note
3
of
respondents'
brief,
and
that
is
varying
periods
of
time
ranging
from
three
to
15
years.
mr.
fritz
wollett
that
is
in
the
record,
yes,
your
honor.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
respondents'
claims,
which
are
based
solely
on
contracts
entered
into
by
the
parties
while
the
respondents
were
employed
in
positions
outside
the
collective
bargaining
unit,
are
removable
under
the
doctrine
of
complete
preemption,
solely
because
after
the
respondents
entered
into
these
contracts
of
employment
they
were
downgraded
into
positions
covered
by
the
collective
bargaining
unit.
this
case
is
not
about
the
merits
of
any
substantive
preemption
defense,
but
it
is
about
the
form
in
which
those
questions
should
be
decided.
this
is
not
a
case
which
raises
a
question
of
whether
we
are
right
or
wrong
in
our
view
that
our
claims
are
not
preempted
by
federal
labor
law,
but
rather
a
basic
question
as
to
whether
or
not
this
complaint
is
removable.
our
contention
is
that
the
unusual
facts
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint
in
this
case
do
not
fall
within
the
doctrine
of
complete
preemption,
because
the
cause
of
action
we
have
alleged
is
not
covered
by
section
301
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
cause
of
action
that
we
are
claiming
does
not
require
the
resolution
of
any
question
of
federal
law.
the
facts
in
this
case,
which
have
already
been
discussed,
show
that
our
contract
claims
were
entered
into
while
the
respondents
were
solely...
were
employed
solely
in
positions
outside
the
collective
bargaining
unit,
and
that
thereafter
they
were
downgraded
into
the
bargaining
unit
and
then
terminated.
however,
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
fred
chambers,
was...
let
me
start
again.
the
complaint
was
removed
to
the
federal
court
after...
we
sued
in
state
court
alleging
a
violation
of
the
contract
claims
which
were
entered
into
while
my
clients
were
outside
the
bargaining
unit.
the
case
was
removed
to
federal
court.
it
was
thereafter
dismissed
on
the
grounds
that
it
was
preempted
by
section
301.
the
claims
of
one
of
the
plaintiffs,
fred
chambers,
were
remanded
to
state
court.
the
reason
that
his
claims
were
remanded,
unlike
the
claims
of
any
of
the
other
respondents
who
are
here
today,
was
that
mr.
chambers
never
was
downgraded
into
a
collective
bargaining
unit
position
after
he
entered
into
the
same
contracts
that
the
respondents
here
today
allegedly
entered
into.
we
believe
that
the
test
for
removability
in
this
case
should
be
determined
by
looking
to
the
source
or
the
basis
of
the
rights
which
have
been
claimed
to
be
violated.
in
the
avco
case,
the
source
of
the
alleged
state
cause
of
action
was
a
no-strike
provision
in
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
in
the
lueck
case,
the
source
of
the
preemption
defense
in
the
finding
that
section
301
preempted
that
state
action
was
a
collective
bargaining
provision
providing
for
the
payment
of
disability
benefits.
in
the
taylor
case,
the
source
of
the
contract
right
was
a
federally
covered
erisa
plan.
mr.
fritz
wollett
no,
your
honor,
we
specifically
stated
in
footnote
13
of
our
brief
that
we
did
not
believe
the
court
would
have
to
adopt
that
test
in
order
to
affirm
this
result.
we
do
not
defend
that
portion
of
the
ninth
circuit's
opinion,
which
seems
to
suggest
that
removal
should
rely
on
the
question
of
whether
a
remedy
is
available.
we
do
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
is
defensible
insofar
as
it
bases
its
test
of
removability
on
the
question
of
whether
or
not
the
plaintiff's
claims
fall
within
a
federal
cause
of
action.
and
our
position
is,
of
course,
that
there
is
no
federal
cause
of
action
into
which
the
plaintiffs'
claims
fall
here.
mr.
fritz
wollett
well,
our
response
would
be
that
our
claims
were
based
upon
contracts
which
were
outside
the
bargaining
agreement
and
therefore--
mr.
fritz
wollett
--we
would
only
make
that
concession,
justice
white,
if
two
facts
were
present:
number
one,
an
agreement
by
both
the
parties
to
the
original
contract,
the
employer
and
the
employes,
that
the
original
contract
could
be
merged
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement;
and
secondly,
an
agreement
by
the
union,
as
the
party
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
that
the
contracts
should
be
merged
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
absent
that
evidence,
we
would
not
agree
with
that,
no,
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
wollett
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
wollett
are
you
talking
about
the
state
court,
your
honor?
mr.
fritz
wollett
i
think
the
state--
mr.
fritz
wollett
--certainly,
justice
white,
i
think
that
the
state
court
would
have
the
obligation,
if
the
federal
preemption
defense
was
raised
in
the
state
court,
to
examine
that
defense.
mr.
fritz
wollett
i
would
agree
with
that,
justice
white.
i
still
think
it's
all
defensive,
but
i
agree
that
a
state
court
would
have
the
right
to
make
that
judgment.
mr.
fritz
wollett
in
support
of
its
argument
that
section
301
accomplishes
complete
preemption,
caterpillar
rejects
the
applicability
of
what
it
characterizes
as
national
labor
relations
act
defensive
preemption.
that
is
irrelevant,
caterpillar
says,
in
complete
preemption
cases
arising
under
section
301.
however,
the
principle
caterpillar
relies
upon
to
establish
the
preemptive
impact
of
section
301
is
derived
from
a
case
involving
national
labor
relations
act
preemption,
the
j.i.
case
case.
petitioners
argue
that
j.i.
case
means
that
whether
the
employees
antecedently
created
contracts
of
employment
survived
the
subsequently
negotiated
collective
bargaining
agreements
or
were
surperseded
and
extinguished
thereby
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
petitioners
are
right.
this
is
a
question
of
federal
law.
but
the
principle
of
exclusivity
and
the
primacy
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
derive
not
from
section
301
and
not
from
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
itself,
but
rather
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
as
the
afl-cio's
amicus
brief
points
out,
the
substantive
rule
upon
which
petitioners
rely
for
their
argument
that
the
state
cause
of
action
has
been
eradicated,
like
any
other
federal
labor
law
preemption
defense,
is
derived
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
thus,
in
response
to
a
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
earlier,
we
believe
that
if
a
federal
preemption
defense
based
upon
labor
law
is
applicable
at
all
to
this
case,
it
is
a
garmon
balancing
test,
it
is
not
a
section
301
test.
not
only
is
the
question
of
federal
preemption
clearly
defensive,
it
is
a
question
for
courts,
not
for
arbitrators.
arbitrators
deal
with
questions
of
interpretation
and
application
of
provisions
in
collective
bargaining
agreements
where
claim
is
made
that
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
has
been
violated.
arbitrators
do
not
deal
with
defenses
raised
by
defendants
in
response
to
claims
being
made
of
violation
of
some
other
kind
of
agreement.
mr.
fritz
wollett
that
is
the
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
fritz
wollett
it
is
that,
your
honor,
but
i
believe
it's
a
defensive
argument.
the
question
of
the
impact
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
upon
the
individual
contracts
of
employment
can
only
be
a
defensive
claim.
the
only
way
that
this
cause
of
action
is
removable
is
if
it
falls
within
the
complete
doctrine
of...
complete
preemption
doctrine
of
section
301.
that
can
only
occur
if
our
claims
are
based
upon
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
fritz
wollett
if
it's
plain
enough
or
there
is
some
basis
for
the
court
to
characterize
our
claims
as
falling
within
the
scope
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
caterpillar
urges
the
court
to
hold
that
arising
under
jurisdiction
exists
because
the
individual
contracts
in
question
were
automatically
merged
into
and
superseded
by
the
bargaining
agreement.
petitioners'
unique
and
unprecedented
request
should
be
rejected
for
two
reasons:
first
of
all,
it
is
defensive;--
and
secondly,
it
is
far
from
clear
that
any
merger
of
the
individual
contracts
into
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
actually
occurred.
for
literally
a
full
century,
this
court,
consistent
with
the
express
intent
of
congress,
has
held
that
claims
of
federal
preemption
raised
in
a
defensive
manner
do
not
provide
removal
jurisdiction.
as
illustrated
before,
the
situation
with
fred
chambers,
the
plaintiff
who
was
not
in
the
bargaining
unit
at
the
time
he
was
terminated,
he
was
permitted
to
take
his
case
back
to
the
state
court.
the
remaining
respondents
were
dismissed.
the
only
difference
between
chambers
and
the
remaining
respondents
is
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
thus,
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
is
defensive.
in
addition
to
the
defensive
nature
of
the
petitioners'
preemption
claim,
it
is
of
course
far
from
clear
that
the
respondents'
claims
are
preempted.
we
know
of
no
proposition
of
federal
law
that
requires
merger
per
se
of
the
individual
contracts
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
unless
there
can
be
a
showing
that
the
parties
to
the
first
contract,
the
employee
and
the
employer,
agreed
to
such
a
merger
and
that
the
collective
bargaining
agent
for
the
employees,
the
union,
agreed
to
that
merger.
this
court
specifically
acknowledged
in
j.i.
case
the
possibility
that
individual
contracts
of
employment
could
coexist
simultaneously
with
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
moreover,
j.i.
case
specifically
stated
that
any
discontinuance
of
the
individual
contracts
as
a
result
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
was
without
prejudice
to
the
right
of
any
employee
to
pursue
damages
under
that
contract
or
any
defense
by
the
employer
thereto.
we
believe
also,
as
previously
noted,
that
the
belknap
case
supports
our
notion
that,
if
this
case...
if
preemption
is
involved
at
all
in
this
case,
it
is
defensive
preemption.
in
that
particular
case,
collective
bargaining...
employees
were
hired
during
a
strike
and
were
allegedly
promised
permanent
employment.
the
strike
was
settled
and
those
employees
were
terminated.
the
settlement,
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargained
strike
settlement,
required
the
employer
to
rehire
the
strikers.
pursuant
to
that,
the
employer
laid
off
the
employees
hired
during
the
strike.
this
court
held
on
the
merits
of
the
preemption
claim
in
that
case
that
the
claims
were
not
preempted,
even
though
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
required
the
reinstatement
of
the
strikers
to
collective
bargaining
unit
positions
which
had
previously
been
occupied
by
the
strikers.
how,
given
the
belknap
decision
on
the
merits
of
the
preemption
claim,
can
petitioners
seriously
contend
that
this
case
is
removable
under
the
doctrine
of
complete
preemption?
finally,
application
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint
rule
will
permit
the
state
court
to
take
evidence
on
the
question
of
the
preemption
defense
and
to
determine
what,
if
any,
impact
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
had
on
the
individual
preexisting
contracts
of
employment
which
are
alleged
to
exist
by
our
complaint.
allowing
this
case
to
be
remanded
to
the
state
court
will
permit
the
case
to
possibly
be
resolved
without
reference
to
any
federal
defense.
the
result
that
petitioners
seek
here
is
essentially
a
ruling
that
any
time
an
employee
is
in
a
collective
bargaining
unit
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
his
claims
are
preempted,
regardless
if
he
attempts
to
allege
a
claim
under
state
law
and
regardless
of
the
source
of
those
claims.
that
argument
would
take
the
scope
of
section
301
and
its
preemptive
impact
far
beyond
the
scope
of
the
national
labor
relations
act.
mr.
fritz
wollett
i
didn't
hear
the
last?
mr.
fritz
wollett
okay.
well,
that's
fair.
i
think
that
they
are
looking
for
a
very
broad
result
from
the
complete
preemption
doctrine.
my
point
is
merely,
justice
stevens,
that
that
would
take...
the
result
they
seek
would
take
the
notion
of
preemption
under
section
301
far
beyond
preemption
that's
found
in
the
underlying
statute,
the
national
labor
relations
act.
surely
congress
did
not
intend
such
a
result.
unless
there
are
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
have
completed
my
argument.
thank
you.
