mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
interrelated
issues.
first,
whether
the
ninth
circuit's
decision
that
a
state
action
can
be
removed
to
federal
court
under
the
complete
preemption
doctrine
only
when
a
superseding
federal
remedy
exists
can
be
squared
with
this
court's
decisions
in
franchise
tax
board,
avco,
and
the
recent
decision
in
metropolitan
life
v.
taylor.
and
second,
whether
a
state
contract
claims,
based
upon
allegedly
independent
employment
contracts
of
individuals
covered
by
a
union
contract,
were
within
the
scope
of
section
301
of
the
labor-management
relations
act,
and
therefore
properly
removed
to
federal
court,
and
dismissed
for
failure
to
exhaust
contractual
grievance
procedures.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
really
quite
simple
and
commonplace
in
the
industrial
setting.
respondents
are
former
employees
of
caterpillar
who
were
laid
off
from
their
bargaining
unit
jobs
pursuant
with
the
company's
contract
with
local
284
of
the
international
association
of
machinists
when
the
company
shut
down
its
plant
in
san
leandro,
california.
at
the
time
of
their
layoff,
all
respondents
were
union
members
whose
employment
was
governed
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
entered
into
with
their
union.
in
fact,
although
respondents
had
worked
at
jobs
outside
of
the
bargaining
unit
for
varying
periods
of
time,
all
except
two
had
returned
to
the
bargaining
unit
prior
to
may
of
1983,
when
caterpillar
and
the
respondents'
union
negotiated
their
most
recent
master
labor
agreement.
and
all
respondents
were
working
at
bargaining
unit
jobs,
covered
by
their
union
contract,
when
the
company
and
the
iam
negotiated
the
package
of
letters
of
agreement
culminating
with
the
agreement
of
june
27,
1984,
providing
each
of
the
respondents
expensive
additional
benefits
because
of
the
plant
shutdown--
respondent--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--for
varying
periods
of
time
that
are
not
fully
established
in
the
record,
but
for
varying
times,
justice
blackmun.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
the
downgrades
occurred
as
the
plant
began
to
shut
down,
and
the
respondents
were
offered
these
positions
back
in
the
bargaining
unit
to
protect
their
employment.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
i'm
not
sure
that's
clear
from
the
record,
justice
blackmun,
but
leave
it
at
this.
the
times
were
not
good
as
far
as
this
plant
was
concerned,
and
there
was
an
effort
to
cut
back
on
the
labor
force
which
resulted
in
the
reduction
in
jobs
in
the
plant.
whether
or
not
they
knew
at
a
given
time
that
the
plant
would
ultimately
be
shut
down
i
don't
think
is
clear
from
the
record,
and
i
really
would
respectfully
submit
that
it
isn't
entirely
relevant
to
the
resolution
of
the
issues
in
this
case.
respondents'
1983
contract
covered
the
usual
wages,
hours
and
working
conditions,
and
also
expressly
covered
employee
rights
in
the
event
of
a
shut
down
of
the
plant.
it
covered
such
matters
as
exercise
of
seniority
in
a
downgrade;
severance
pay;
continuation
of
medical
and
dental
benefit
coverage;
and
even
transfer
rights
to
other
caterpillar
plants.
these
supplemental
letters
of
agreement
were
the
product
of
legally
required
effects
bargaining
required
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
between
the
company
and
the
union.
now
respondents
sued
caterpillar
and
several
management
employees
in
state
court
in
december,
1984,
claiming
that
their
layoff
breached
state
law
contracts,
independent
of
their
collective
bargaining
agreement.
more
specifically
in
their
complaint,
respondents
contended
that
while
they
were
working
in
salaried
jobs
outside
their
union
contract,
petitioners
promised
that
they
would
have
lasting
permanent
employment,
and
that
they
would
be
provided
other
jobs
if
the
company
shut
down
the
plant.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
yes,
your
honor.
respondents
further
alleged
in
their
complaint
that
similar
promises
were
made
to
them
after
they
returned
to
their
bargaining
unit
jobs
prior
to
the
shutdown
of
the
plant.
the
district
court
ruled
that
respondents'
complaint
was
properly
removed
to
federal
court,
since
the
complaint
stated
federal
claims
arising
under
section
301.
the
court
then
dismissed
the
complaint
because
respondents
had
failed
to
exhaust
the
applicable
grievance
procedures
under
their
union
contract.
respondents
elected
not
to
amend
their
complaint
and
appeal.
the
ninth
circuit
reversed,
ruling
that
the
case
was
not
properly
removed,
and
this
court
granted
a
writ
of
certiorari.
our
argument
can
be
summarized
briefly
as
follows.
first,
this
court
has
clearly
ruled
that,
contrary
to
the
ninth
circuit,
federal
removal
jurisdiction
cannot
be
conditioned
on
the
existence
of
a
superseding
federal
remedy.
this
court
has
reaffirmed
as
recently
as
its
april
6th
unanimous
decision
in
taylor
that
removal
jurisdiction
is
proper
if
a
purported
state
claim
falls
within
the
broad
preemptive
reach
of
section
301.
thus,
the
second
and
critical
issue
is
whether
the
state
claims
asserted
here
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
301.
quite
simply,
these
claims
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
301
since,
in
the
words
of
allis-chalmers
v.
lueck,
they
are
inextricably
intertwined
with
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
the
first
issue,
the
removal
issue
raised
by
this
case,
is
a
question
of
federal
jurisdiction.
it
is
an
issue
separate
and
entirely
distinct
from
the
issue
of
remedy
mistakenly
identified
by
the
ninth
circuit
as
the
basis
for
its
decision
that
this
case
should
be
remanded
to
state
court.
this
court's
decisions
in
franchise
tax
board
and
avco
and
its
recent
decision
in
taylor
established
the
indisputable
proposition
that
the
issue
of
whether
or
not
plaintiffs
would
obtain
a
remedy
is
entirely
irrelevant
to
the
courts'
removal
jurisdiction.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
i
would
respectfully
submit
that
it
doesn't,
your
honor,
for
the
reason
that
what
the
plaintiffs
have
alleged
in
their
complaint
is
really
quite
irrelevant
to
the
question
of
the
court's
jurisdiction
under
section
301
of
the
labor-management
relations
act.
what
they
say
in
their
complaint
is
not
the
important
factor.
the
important
factor
is
what
congress
has
said,
and
what
this
court
has
interpreted.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
is
still
fully
applicable
to
cases
other
than
section
301.
we
respectfully
submit
that
in
light
of
the
court's
line
of
cases
under
301,
and
the
complete
preemption
doctrine
that's
been
announced
by
this
court's
decision,
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
really
has
no
validity
with
respect
to
301
cases
because
of
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
not
precisely.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
correct,
your
honor.
but
it
isn't
necessary
to
reach
that
proposition
for
this
case.
because
in
this
case,
even
assuming
the
well-pleaded
complaint
doctrine
were
applied
fully
in
the
context
of
a
301
case,
on
the
face
of
plaintiffs'
complaint,
they
have
identified
the
facts
that
all
respondents
were
union
members,
that
all
respondents
were
in
their
bargaining
unit
jobs
covered
by
a
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
they've
acknowledged
the
existence
of
that
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
justice
o'connor,
we
submit
that
the
line
of
cases
involving
garmin,
machinists,
and
belknap,
are
really
irrelevant
in
the
context
of
a
301
case.
this
court
has
stated
that
really
301
cases
are
not
governed
by
the
courts--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--the
thrust
of
our
argument
is
that
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
falls
squarely
within
301,
because
it
falls
squarely
within
rights
and
obligations
governed
by
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
that,
simply
put,
is
the
position
we're
taking.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
not
at
all,
justice
white.
and
in
fact,
under
those
hypothetical
facts,
we
would
concede
that
they
would
in
fact
have--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--these
respondents
were
returned
to
the
bargaining
unit
well
prior
to
the
negotiation
of
the
1983
collective
bargaining
agreement?
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
and
presumably,
an
arbitrator,
if
this
case
were
ultimately
to
reach
arbitration,
could
discover
that
in
fact
those
very
rights
that
they
allege
existed
when
they
were
salaried
employees
were
part
of
the
package
of
give
and
take
at
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
respondent
williams
was
in
the
bargaining
unit
for
over
four
years
prior
to
the
action
that
was
taken
here.
he
received
full
benefits
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
full--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--it's
our
contention
that
what
he
says
in
his
complaint
is
not
the
important
factor.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
no,
we
don't
reject
that.
we
suggest
that
the
doctrine
of
the
well-pleaded
complaint,
and
the
doctrine
that
the
plaintiff
is
the
master
of
his
complaint
has
less
validity
within
the
scope
of
301
cases
such
as
this.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
that's
not
our
contention...
in
this
case,
that
is
our
contention.
that's
not
our
contention
generally
that
all--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--that's
correct,
justice
white.
the
contention
is
that
these
are
private
consensual
agreements
that
they
are
relying
on,
the
independent
contracts
that
they
rely
on.
and
as
private
consensual
agreements,
they
can
be
negotiated.
contrary
to
respondent's
contention
that
somehow
you
look
at
these...
these
agreements
in
a
vacuum,
these--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--that
is
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
that's
the
judgment
that
we
submit
the
district
court
properly
made
on
the
basis
of
the
complaint,
and
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
our
contention
is
that
if
the
respondents,
if
the
plaintiffs
in
a
case
brought
in
state
court
are
covered
under
the
terms
and
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
and
their
claims
do
not
assert
nonwaivable
state
rights...
nonwaivable
state
rights,
as
opposed
to
the
private
consensual
agreements
that
we
have
here...
that
that
case
is
removable
as
a
matter
of
law
under
section
301
in
this
court's
decisions.
and
it
doesn't
turn...
this
court
in
the
taylor
case...
respondents
have
argued
that
it
depends
on
the
clarity
of
the
issue
of
301
preemption.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
yes,
sir?
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
our...
our
position
is
that
301
governs
this
case,
and
therefore--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--this
court
has
said
that
under
section
301
preemption
is
complete.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
they
have
specifically
alleged
the
facts
that
these
respondents
were
in
the
bargaining
unit
at
the
time
they
were
laid
off.
and
their
contention
is
that
the
layoff
was
improper
as
a
result
of
the
promises
that
they
had
before
they
returned
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement...
to
coverage
under
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
it's
our
contention
that
the
question
of
whether
it
is
clearly
pleaded
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
or
not
clearly
pleaded
in
the
plaintiffs'
complaint
is
really
entirely
irrelevant.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
they
have
attempted
to
say
just
that
in
this
complaint.
they
have
stated
in
their
complaint
that
these
promises
were
continually
and
repeatedly
made
to
plaintiffs
while
they
were
management
and
weekly
salaried
employees,
and
thereby
constituted
a
total
agreement,
wholly
independent
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
pertaining
to
the
hourly
employees,--
it's
our
contention
as
i
said
earlier--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--that
you
cannot
bring
it
as
a
state
cause
of
action
because
these
employees
were
in
the
bargaining
unit;
they'd
been
in
the
bargaining
unit
for
years;
and
the
bargaining
unit
expressly
covered
the
matters
that
they
contend
were
covered
independent
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
needless
to
say,
that's
not
a
situation
covered
by
this
agreement.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
i
think
to
the
extent
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
rights
and
remedies
afforded
to
the
plaintiffs
are
intertwined
with
the
stock
issue--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--that's
a
matter
that
is
covered
under
federal
law,
and
that
is
complete
preemption
under--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--the
stock
option
agreement--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--obviously,
the
answer
to
that
question
isn't
dispositive
in
this
case.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
trying
to
answer
the
question
directly,
it's
our
position
that
if
that
agreement
to
give
them
stock
at
the
time
of
plant
shutdown--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--were
in
some
manner
intertwined
with
the
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement,
it
would
be
preempted
under
section
301.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
if
there
were
language
of
that
sort,
of
if
there
were
other--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--if
they
had
bargained
over
and
expressly
excluded
that
matter,
expressly
excluded
it
under
the
court's
decision
in
at&t,
then
i
think
that
would
be
actionable
in
state
courts.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
justice
white,
the
crucial
fact
is
that
these
suits...
this
suit
was
brought
well
after
the
time
they
returned
to
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
and
on
this
record,
i'll
concede,
we
don't
know
what
was
bargained
across
the
bargaining
table
in
1983,
because
that's
a
matter--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--and
justice
white--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--i
accept
that.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
we
don't
contend
that
those
promises
are
no
longer
valid.
our
contention
is
that
those
promises
must
be
reconciled
with
the
express
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
and
the
side
letters
of
agreement
which
dealt
with
plant
shutdown.
because
those
contractual
terms
deal...
deal
precisely
with
the
same
issues
that
they
allege
their
independent
value.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
well,
that
in
fact
is
the
case.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
our
contention
is
that
the
issues
raised
in
a
301
removal
situation
are,
whether
or
not
those
plaintiffs
were
covered
under
the
terms
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement,
first
of
all.
and
secondly,
whether
or
not
those
claims
asserted
by
those
plaintiffs
were
private
consensual
agreements,
or
whether
they
were
under
the
provisions
of
this
court's
decisions
in
lueck,
nonwaivable
state
rights.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
justice
scalia,
i
think
that
this
court's
decision
in
the
taylor
case
really
bears
directly
on
the
question
that
you've
raised.
the
court
there
dealt
with
preemption
under
erisa,
of
course.
but
under
erisa,
the
erisa
provisions
were
closely
tailored
to
the
complete
preemption
notion
of
preemption
announced
in
301.
the
court
said,
the
touchstone
of
a
federal
district
court's
removal
jurisdiction
is
not
the
obviousness
of
the
preemption
defense,
but
the
intent
of
congress.
we
must
honor
that
intent,
whether
preemption
was
obvious
or
not,
at
the
time
this
suit
was
filed.
so
the
contention
made
by
respondents
that
this
court
may
look
nowhere
beyond
the
face
of
its
complaint,
in
a
301
context,
we
submit,
is
not
a
proper
construction
of
this
court's
decision.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
first
of
all,
i
would
like
to
deal
with
the
respondents'
argument
that
garmon
machinists
and
belknap
balancing
type
of
preemption
governs
this
case.
i
think
this
court's
decision
in
the
lueck
case,
the
unanimous
decision
in
that
case,
has
rejected
the
use
of
balancing
preemption
in
the
context
of
a
case
arising
under
section
301.
the
court
stated:
"the
balancing
of
federal
and
state
interests
required
by
garmon
preemption
is
irrelevant,
since
congress,
acting
within
its
power
under
the
commerce
clause,
has
provided
that
federal
law
must
prevail.
"
and
it's
our
contention
that
that
is
precisely
the
scope
of
the
district
court's
examination
of
the
case
upon
removal
to
federal
court:
does
it
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
301.
finally,
national
labor
policy
is
founded
on
the
congressional
mandate
that
claims
relating
to
collective
bargaining
agreements
are
to
be
resolved
under
uniform
principles
of
federal
law.
respondents
urge
this
court
to
retreat
from
those
principles
and
allow
plaintiffs
to
define
the
scope
of
301
and
state
courts,
based
on
their
own
notions
of
the
importance
of
state
interests--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--that's
correct.
but
in
any
event,
their
contention
is
that
the
state
court
would
then
balance
the
interests,
the
state
interest
against
the
federal
interest.
and
under
the
circumstances
we
have
before
this
court,
it's
our
contention
that
that's
a
proper
role
for
the
federal
court
to
decide.
why?
because
the
petitioner
here--
mr.
gerald
d.
skoning
--that's
correct.
and
we
don't
contend
that
the
state
court
does
not
have
the
power
to
evaluate
those
federal
issues.
our
contention
is
in
fact
that
there
is
concurrent
jurisdiction
between
the
state
and
the
federal
courts
under
301,
and
the
fact
of
concurrent
jurisdiction
reveals
that
it
is
a
federal
claim
in
nature
under
301.
it
is
recharacterized
as
a
301
claim
and
therefore
properly
removed
to
federal
court
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
such
a
retreat,
we
submit,
would
generate
conflicting
results
in
interpreting
collective
bargaining
agreements
based
on
the
variety
of
state
laws
of
implied
contract,
covenants
of
good
faith
and
fair
dealing,
employment
at
will,
and
the
like.
conflicts
such
as
these
are
inconsistent
with
our
basic
labor
law
principles.
we
urge
this
court
to
reconfirm
these
basic
principles
and
reverse
the
judgment
of
the
ninth
circuit.
thank
you.
