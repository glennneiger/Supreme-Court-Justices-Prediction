if
you
are
right
about
that,
doesn't
it
mean,
i
mean
a
clear
and
convincing
standard
surely
doesn't
require
18
to
1
odds?
doesn't
it
mean
you
would
win
no
matter
what
the
standard
is
if
this
is
a
typical
case?
if
this
is
a
typical
case
i
wonder
if
the
standard
really
make
much
difference.
justice
stevens
no,
you
would
be
saying
if
you
are
going
to
win
anyway
once
you
have
told
the
child
that
we
had
a
trial
on
this
father,
we
didn't...
we
don't
think
there
is
just
a
51
percent
chance
this
is
your
father.
the
evidence
was
clear
and
convincing
that
this
really
your
father.
justice
stevens
i
understand.
you
have
the
other
evidence.
and
of
course
i
doubt
if
you
ever
have
any
of
these
cases
where
you
have
nothing
but
blood
test
evidence.
don't
you
always
prove
access?

ms.
barton,
i
probably
shouldn't
interrupt
you
because
i
have
another
mathematical
question.
you
argue
from
the
fact
that
the
interests
are
equal
and
therefore
you
should
have
a
51
percent
standard.
supposing
i
thought
the
interests
of
the
child
were
greater,
therefore
i
suppose
less
than
preponderance
would
be
enough
to
justify
prevailing
because
you
want
the
child
to
win
in
as
many
cases
as
possible.
