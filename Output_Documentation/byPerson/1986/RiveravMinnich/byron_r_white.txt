i
would
think
you
would
be...
on
reasonable
doubt
standard
if
it
is...
19
to
1,
you
say?
justice

eighteen
to

justice

so
should
the
jury
be
told
that
under
your
standard
clear
and
convincing,
and
that
means
that
proof
that
it
is
18
to
1
that
he
is
the
father
isn't
good
enough?
justice
white
what
did
the
blood
test
show?
justice
white
i
may
not
have...
go
ahead.
justice
white
that
he
was
the
father.
justice

one
chance
out
of
18?
no,
18--
justice
white
--yes,
but
the
odds
were
18
to
one
that
he
was
the
father?
justice
white
that
he
was
the
father.
justice

do
you
think
these
blood
tests
showed
that
the
odds
were
18
to
1
that
this
particular
person
was
the
parent?
if
not,
what
does
the
18
to
1
mean?
justice
white
you
have
said
the
blood
test
reduces
the
risk
of
error
terrifically
and
it
does...
if
they
exclude
him,
why,
he
is
excluded.
is
that
the
only
way
that
it
reduces
the
risk
of
error?
does
it
just
show
that
he
could
be
the
father?
or
does
it
make
it
more
likely
than
not
that
he
is
the
father?
justice
white
well,
were
they?
is
that
what
these
blood
tests
showed?
justice
white
i
should
say--
justice
white
--that
is
the
only
direct
evidence
there
was
here
anyway.
justice
white
we
are
not
passing
on
that.
we
are
just
passing
on
the
standard
of
proof.
but
do
you
think
that
the
blood
tests
showed
that
the
odds
were
18
to
1
that
this
particular
defendant
was
the
father?
