justice
scalia
you
don't
really...
you
are
putting
it
too
strongly.
i
wouldn't
want
someone
to
make
me
a
parent
without
my
consent,
but
you
are
just
saying
you
bear
some
of
the
consequences
of
parenthood.
if
this
individual
is
not
in
fact
the
father
he
still
knows
he
is
not
the
father
and
he
feels
none
of
the
moral
obligation
of
fatherhood.
it
is
not
making
somebody
a
father
against
his
consent.
it
is
just
subjecting
him
to
some
of
the
economic
consequences
that
he
would
be
subjected
to
if
he
were
a
father.
so
it
is
still
money
you
are
talking
about.
justice
scalia
can
society
enforce
that
upon
him
except
financially?
justice
scalia
now,
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
i
don't
know
how
this
cuts
either
way.
do
you
think
you
are
likely
to
get
a
more
accurate
determination
as
far
as
the
child
is
concerned
by
requiring
a
higher
burden
of
proof?
justice
scalia
that
means
that
unless
you
prove
beyond
a
mere
preponderance
that
this
individual
is
the
father,
although
he
may
be
the
father,
you
come
out
with
a
verdict
by
a
court
that
he
is
not
the
father,
right?
justice
scalia
even
though
he
is
and
you
know,
if
you
went
on
a
preponderance
he
would
have
been
found
to
be.
justice
scalia
the
risk
is
greater
when
you
require
more
of
a
preponderance.
justice
scalia
it
doesn't
tell
the
factfinder
to
proceed
more
cautiously.
it
tells
the
factfinder
even
though
you
believe
that
this
person
is
the
child's
father,
you
should
come
back
with
a
verdict
that
he
is
not
the
father.
justice
scalia
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
as
a
practical
matter
what
you
are
talking
about
is
shifting
the
risk
from
the
man
to
the
state,
no?
i
mean
what
most
of
these
cases
involve
are
whether
the
state
is
going
to
get
reimbursed
for
some
payments
that
the
states
had
to
make?
justice
scalia
isn't
that
generally
what
is
going
on?
justice
scalia
you
did
mistake
my
question.
as
a
practical
matter,
the
money
that
is
collected
is
that
likely
to
go
to
the
child
or
is
it
likely
to
go
to
the
state
to
reimburse
the
state
for
support
payments?
justice
scalia
and
what
percentage
of
these
cases
in
your
experience
involve
that
situation
where
the
real
party
in
interest
is
the
state?
justice
scalia
probably
the
vast
majority
of
them,
though,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
i
didn't
understand
that
that
is
how
the
18
to
1
works.
i
thought
what
it
was,
that
if
this
young
woman
had
36
people
that
she
had
had
contact
with
two
could
possibly
have
qualified.
that
is
not
it?
justice
scalia
that
is
something
quite
different
from
saying
that
the
odds
are
18
to
1
that
this
was
the
father.
justice
scalia
i
am
not
sure
it
has
anything
to
do
with
math.
i
just
think
it
isn't
18
to
1
that
that
person
was
the
father.
it
is
just
out
of
any
random
group
of
36
people,
or
maybe
it
is
out
of
36
hispanics.
i
don't
know
how
the
test
was
done.
two
would
qualify.
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
18
to
1
this
was
the
father.
only
two
would
qualify
out
of
36?
i
thought
it
was
just
the
reverse.
justice
scalia
well,
you
have
to,
because
blood
test
evidence
is
just
not
that
strong.
all
it
means
is
that
if
there
are
18
million
hispanics,
1
million
hispanics
could
have
been
the
father.
that
is
not
an
18
to
1
shot
that
this
individual
is
the
father.
it
is
a
good
deal
away
from
an
18
to
1
shot,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
that
is
not
the
right
response.
the
response
is,
justice
stevens,
that
is
precisely
what
my
opponent
is
arguing.
since
the
interest
of
the
father
is
so
great,
he
wants
the
father
to
win
with
less
than
a
preponderance,
in
a
way.
