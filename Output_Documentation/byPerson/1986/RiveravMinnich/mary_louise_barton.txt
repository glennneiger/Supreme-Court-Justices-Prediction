ms.
mary
louise
barton
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
interest
of
the
states
in
family
matters
has
well
been
respected
by
the
court
in
both
theory
and
precedent.
as
to
the
evidentiary
standard
in
a
paternity
proceeding
<forty-one>
[=
41]
states
have
seen
fit
to
choose
the
preponderant
standard
of
evidence
to
prove
paternity.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
forty-one,
mr.
chief
justice.
this
court
is
required
to
correct
clear
constitutional
violations
in
state
statutes
in
order
to
ensure
constitutional
fairness.
an
analysis
of
the
due
process
clause
as
it
relates
to
the
preponderant
standard
of
proof
in
a
paternity
proceeding
demonstrates
that
there
is
no
clear
constitutional
violation
in
the
state's
choice
of
this
particular
evidentiary
standard.
furthermore,
the
preponderance
standard
of
the
evidence
in
this
context
assures
fairness
to
all
the
parties.
appellant's
main
contention
is
that
his
rights
are
the
same
as
the
parents
in
santosky
versus
kramer.
appellant
argues
that
his
lack
of
parental
ties
are
as
deserving
of
the
sane
constitutional
protection
at
those
parents
who
had
formed
a
parent-child
relationship
with
their
children.
this
is
incorrect
as
a
general
proposition,
fully
developed
familial
relationships
involving
the
assumption
of
parental
duties
with
mutual
love
and
affection
are
entitled
to
a
significantly
greater
level
of
due
process
protection
than
the
inchoate
relationship
at
issue
in
this
case.
no
court
can
impose
a
parent-child
relationship.
the
only
thing
a
court
can
impose
is
a
support
order,
and
that
would
mean
monetary
support.
practically,
the
interests
at
stake
in
a
paternity
suit
are
economic
on
the
parts
of
all
the
parties.
to
distinguish
santosky
from
the
case
at
bar,
in
santosky
the
court
was
clearly
speaking
about,
as
i
have
already
stated,
an
already
established
familial
relationship
with
mutual
love
and
affection
and
a
day
to
day
caretaking
role
on
the
part
of
the
parents
with
their
children.
in
santosky
the
state
was
pitted
against
the
parents.
the
state
came
in
with
both
feet
upon
those
parents,
i
will
grant
you
that,
in
this
case,
i
submit
that
these
interests
deal
with
private
parties.
the
state
is
there
to
facilitate.
the
state
is
there
to
give
a
mother
an
attorney
should
she
need
one,
if
she
is
on
welfare.
the
state
in
pennsylvania
is
also
there
to
give
an
indigent
father
an
attorney
via
the
public
defender
system,
as
far
as
the
hla
blood
tests,
no
one
any
more
since
little
versus
streeter
is
denied
that
opportunity
to
be
heard.
anyone
in
the
united
states
can
get
hla
blood
tests
regardless
of
their
financial
or
their
economic
status.
the
liberty
interest
at
stake
in
santosky,
as
this
court
said,
could
be
extinguished
forever
as
a
result
of
this
termination
proceeding.
here
there
is
no
liberty
interest
at
stake.
here
there
are
no
familial
ties.
the
only
interests
at
stake
are
economic.
in
santosky
the
court
said
the
child
will
lose
the
right
of
support
and
maintenance
from
their
parents
forever
upon
the
termination
of
parental
rights.
so
what
the
court
did
was,
they
raised
the
standard
in
order
to
prevent
this,
in
order
to
protect
the
child's
interests.
what
the
appellant
is
asking
you
to
do
here,
they
are
asking
for
the
child
to
lose
the
rights
to
support
and
maintenance
forever,
and
they
are
asking
you
to
raise
the
standard
to
cause
this
result.
i
submit
to
you
that
that
result
would
be
unfair
and
inapposite
to
what
santosky
holds.
in
santosky
the
court
balances
the
parents'
and
the
child's
interests
against
the
state.
it
decided
that
the
parents'
and
the
child's
interests
were
served
by
a
higher
standard.
in
this
case
the
parents,
the
father
in
particular,
comes
in
as
an
adversary
to
the
child.
the
court
is
asked
to
balance
these
interests
as
adversaries.
in
santosky
for
the
majority
of
the
court
the
issue
was
familial
bonds.
for
the
dissent
in
santosky,
the
issue
was
the
safety
of
the
child.
i
submit
that
the
concerns
of
both
the
majority
and
the
dissent
in
santosky
were
for
the
child.
i
would
ask
this
court
to
take
this
case
on
those
terms
as
well
and
to
consider
the
child's
interests
as
you
did
in
santosky.
the
issue
in
this
case,
i
will
repeat,
is
the
monetary
support.
in
santoksy
the
issue
was
imprecise
substantive
standards
which
left
determinations
open
to
the
subjective
values
of
one
particular
judge.
in
santosky
you
mentioned
the
issues
of
cultural
bias
because
most
of
these
parents
happened
to
come
from
poor
economic
statuses.
you
mentioned
the
issue
of...
there
were
other
issues
that
you
mentioned,
the
state
being
able
to
form
the
case
from
the
very
beginning
against
the
parents
and
how
you
as
a
court
felt
that
was
unfair.
in
this
case
the
decision
is
left
to
either
one
judge
or
to
a
jury
of
12.
in
this
particular
case
the
decision
was
left
to
a
jury
of
12.
it
as
civil
proceeding.
we
did
not
need
to
have
a
unanimous
decision.
however,
we
did.
the
hlas
were
provided.
that
is
not
an
imprecise
substantive
standard,
that
is
empirical
medical
evidence
which
is
based
on
the
evidence
as
it
comes
into
the
case.
another
important
issue
in
santosky
was
this
court's
concern
that
the
significant
prospect
of
an
erroneous
termination
existed.
i
submit
that
in
this
case
there
is
a
small
prospect
of
an
erroneous
decision
due
to
the
medical
advancements
that
we
have
made
in
genetic
testing,
and
one
of
those
tests
happens
to
be
the
hlas.
i
would
also
like
to
distinguish
little
versus
streeter
because
i
feel
that
is
a
very
important
case
when
it
comes
to
our
case
here.
you
used
the
word,
this
court
used
the
word
"compelling
interests"
of
both
the
father
and
the
child
in
little
versus
streeter,
and
i
believe
that
the
interests
were
in
the
accuracy
of
the
determination.
i
submit
that
your
decision
to
allow
the
hlas
to
have
them
accessible
to
everyone
involved
cleared
up
the
problem,
and
i
submit
it
is
just
one
piece
of
the
problem
in
this
case.
the
hlas
provide
empirical
scientific
evidence
they
reduce
an
erroneous
determination
greatly.
there
is
no
longer
one
person's
word
against
another.
if
the
red
blood
cell
tests
are
run
and
the
man
is
excluded,
the
state
does
not
even
bring
any
kind
of
a
paternity
suit.
no
suit
is
filed.
if
the
hlas
are
then
run,
if
the
man
is
not
excluded
by
the
red
blood
cell
tests
an
hla
test
is
run
and
then
the
father
would
be
included
to
a
greater
percent.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
your
honor,
i
hesitate
to
answer
that
question.
i
have
seen
them
based
on
different
genetic
factors
to
be
very
high
if
the
parties
involved
have
very
rare
genetic
characteristics.
in
this
case
evidently
the
genetic
characteristics
were
not
all
that
rare.
i
also
understand
that
because
the
mother
was
a
white
caucasian
and
the
father
was
of
hispanic
dissent
that
the
statistical
tables
that
were
used
did
not
allow
the
phds
that
figure
out
the
statistical
results
to
come
up
with
as
high
perhaps
a
standard
as
they
might
have
had
there
been
two
white
people
involved
or
two
black
people
involved
or
something
like
that,
your
honor.
in
little
versus
streeter
i
submit
that
the
father,
the
putative
father
was
denied
due
process.
i
think
it
was
a
horrendous
denial
of
due
process.
the
odds
were
stacked
against
that
father.
that
is
not
the
facts
here,
i
submit.
the
facts
here,
as
far
as
fairness
in
procedure,
this
father
as
well
as
the
mother
and
child
were
given
the
right
to
a
hearing
before
a
domestic
relations
hearing
officer
at
which
time
paternity
could
be
acknowledged
or
denied
if
paternity
was
denied
the
hla
blood
tests
become
a
standard
procedure
then.
they
are
automatically
ordered.
the
parties
appear
for
hla
blood
tests.
after
the
hla
blood
tests
are
returned
the
father
has
another
hearing
before
a
domestic
relations
hearing
officer,
an
officer
of
the
court.
at
that
time
once
again
he
may
deny
or
acknowledge.
if
he
continues
to
deny
after
the
hla
blood
tests
have
included
him
to
a
large
percentage
he
has
the
choice
of
a
jury
trial
or
a
bench
trial.
that
choice
may
be
made
by
the
mother
as
well.
she
could
have
opted
for
a
jury
or
bench
trial
as
well.
also
at
that
time,
of
course,
the
public
defender
system
exists
for
the
father
to
use,
and
i
represent
the
district
attorney's
office.
the
district
attorney's
office
exists
for
the
mother
to
use.
i
submit
that
as
far
as
fairness
of
procedure
both
sides
are
given
exactly
the
same
procedural
safeguards.
i
will
restate
it.
the
issue
in
streeter
was
accuracy,
and
i
believe
that
your
decision
was
absolutely
correct.
i
also
believe
that
the
burden
of
proof
as
justice
scalia
mentioned
earlier
does
not
make
a
decision
more
accurate.
i
believe
what
it
does,
it
shifts
the
risks
of
an
erroneous
decision.
in
this
case
the
appellant
asks
you
to
shift
the
risk
to
the
child.
i
submit
that
that
is
fundamentally
unfair
to
the
children.
the
issue
then
is
whether
the
preponderant
standard
fairly
allocates
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
factfinding
between
the
parties.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
that's
correct.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
justice
scalia,
in
my...
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
when
the
fundamental
liberty
interests,
of
course,
are
at
stake
then
it
is
a
private
party
versus
the
state
and
then,
of
course,
in
all
fairness
the
risk
should
be
shifted
more
towards
the
state
so
that
an
individual
cannot
be
deprived
of
what
is
a
fundamental
liberty
interest.
in
this
case
i
submit
that
the
risk
will
be
shifted
to
the
child,
and
that
is
illogical
and
unjust.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
i
am
sorry,
i
did
misunderstand
your
question.
if
the
mother
and
the
child
are
on
welfare,
justice
scalia,
then
the
money
goes
into
the
state
coffers.
if
the
child
is
not
on
welfare,
then
the
money
goes
directly
to
the
mother
and
the
child.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
since
i
only
get
involved
in
those
interests
where
the
state
is
involved
i
can't
answer
that
question
fairly.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
i
believe
that's
correct,
because
i
believe
the
women,
the
mothers
that
are
not
on
welfare
are
then
of
the
next
socioeconomic
level
where
they
cannot
afford
to
have
an
attorney.
therefore
paternity
suits
on
behalf
of
their
children
are
never
brought.
i
believe
that
as
the
economic
scale
goes
up
that
more
paternity
suits
would
be
brought,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
i
believe--
ms.
mary
louise
barton
--if
the
odds
would
be
18
to
1?
ms.
mary
louise
barton
i
believe
they
did,
your
honor.
the
other
factor
that
has
to
be
factored
in
here
is
access,
and
of
course
that
comes
in
as
part
of
the
other
evidence.
of
course,
if--
ms.
mary
louise
barton
--yes,
and
if
only
one
person
had
access,
and
that
person
happened
to
be
a
person
with
an
18
to
1
probability
of
paternity--
ms.
mary
louise
barton
--well,
that's
correct.
there
was
only
one
person
with
access.
this
young
woman
was
15
years
of
age,
your
honor,
and
that
is
an
extremely
important
part
of
a
case.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
in
all
honesty
i
understand
that
that
is
how
it
is
done,
and
as
i
tried
to
explain
earlier,
i
believe
the
statistical
tables
that
are
used
at
this
time
when
it
comes
to
parents
of
two
different
nationalities
are
not
as
highly
refined
as
they
may
be
once
more
of
these
kind
of
relationships
come
forward
and
we
are
able
to
do
statistical
tables
based
on
more
of
these
kind
of
relationships
as
far
as
genetic
markers
go,
your
honor.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
well,
really,
in
all
fairness,
i--
ms.
mary
louise
barton
--to
me
what
you
have
said
would
be
the
same
as
18
to
1,
but
that
is
why
i
was
not
a
mathematics
major
in
college.
0
[generallaughter.]
ms.
mary
louise
barton
no,
that
would
be
correct,
but
you
know,
in
my
brief
i
have
cited
several
forensic
medical
articles
that
deal
with
hlas
and
how
the
statistical...
it
is
all
based
on
mendel's
theory
of
probability
and
mendel's
theory
of
genetics,
and
in
those
articles
it
is
much
better
explained
by
medical
people
who
know
what
they
are
talking
about
and
in
all
honesty
when
it
comes
to
these
statistical
theories
i
am
not
the
person
to
ask.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
well,
justice
stevens,
i
believe
that
it
does
because
i
believe
that
when
you
go
into
a
suit
just
because
one
side
has
better
evidence
or
more
evidence
than
another,
we
don't
automatically
raise
the
ante
on
them,
and
that
is
what
you
would
be
doing
here.
you
would
be
saying
to
the
child,
since
you
have
very
good
scientific
evidence,
therefore
we
require
you--
ms.
mary
louise
barton
--well,
i
believe
that
one
could
say
that.
however,
i
don't
believe,
as
i
said
before,
that
is
how
the
standard
of
proof
should
be
decided.
i
also
think,
as
the
other
evidence
is
just
as
important,
and
we
would
never
base
our
whole
case
on
one
piece
of
evidence.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
absolutely.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
yes.
i
do
know
if
this
will
help
at
all
that
when
they
do
transplants,
kidney
transplants,
that
they
rely
on
these
hla
tests,
so
i
do
know
that
they
are
very
reliable
as
far
as
genetic
markers
go.
as
far
as
the
probability
of
paternity
goes
i
can't
explain
that
to
you.
i
apologize.
the
issue
then
is
whether
the
preponderance
standard
fairly
allocates
the
risk
of
an
erroneous
factfinding
between
the
parties.
the
answer
is
yes.
the
interests
of
the
father
are
economic.
the
interests
of
the
child
are
economic.
the
interests
of
the
mother
are
economic.
the
interests
are
therefore
of
equivalent
constitutional
significance.
the
mandate
for
placing
a
greater
burden
on
one
party
stems
from
the
recognition
that
the
other
party
has
a
constitutionally
protected
interest
of
greater
import
at
stake.
the
mandate
therefore
is
negated.
the
interests
are
of
equal
significance
and
are
the
same.
since
the
interests
are
the
same
how
would
the
due
process
clause
have
the
risk
of
error
allocated?
a
higher
burden
of
proof
serves
no
useful
constitutional
purpose.
any
advantage
accorded
to
one
party
by
changing
the
standard
of
proof
imposes
a
corresponding
disadvantage
on
the
other
parties,
in
this
case
the
child
and
the
mother
and
the
state
somewhat.
this
would
accomplish
only
this.
it
will
visit
the
condemnation
of
the
parent--
ms.
mary
louise
barton
--correct,
but
i
also
want
the
decision
to
be
fair
in
as
many
cases
as
possible.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
and
if
i
may
borrow
a
quote
from
one
of
this
court's
cases,
if
you
would
shift
the
risk
to
the
child,
all
it
would
accomplish
would
be
to
visit
the
condemnation
of
the
parents'
irresponsible
liaison
upon
the
child.
this
result
is
illogical
and
unjust.
moreover,
placing
this
standard
of
proof
disability
upon
the
child
is
contrary
to
the
basic
concept
of
our
system
that
legal
burdens
should
bear
some
relationship
to
the
individual
responsibility
for
wrongdoing.
ms.
mary
louise
barton
i
think
webber.
webber.
there
is
no
principle
basis
for
contending
that
the
child
is
better
served
by
decreasing
the
risk
of
erroneous
findings
of
paternity
at
the
cost
of
increasing
the
risk
of
erroneous
findings
of
nonpaternity.
i
will
go
through
again,
the
appellant
has
been
afforded
generous
process
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania,
and
i
went
through
those
before.
i
think
they
are
important
enough
that
perhaps
i
should
reiterate.
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
require
that
appellant
receive
proper
notice
upon
the
filing
of
a
paternity
suit.
he
is
afforded
a
hearing.
he
is
afforded
the
right
to
counsel.
he
is
afforded
the
right
to
a
public
defender
should
he
be
indigent.
he
is
afforded
the
right
to
blood
tests.
he
is
afforded
the
right
to
a
bench
or
a
jury
trial
and
then
12
of
his
peers
would
sit
to
hear
the
evidence.
he
is
afforded
full
appellate
review
as
this
case
well
demonstrates.
appellant
therefore
is
afforded
the
essence
of
due
process,
the
opportunity
to
be
heard
at
a
meaningful
time
and
in
a
meaningful
way.
the
suit
is
comparable
to
a
negligence
suit.
the
bottom
line
is
monetary.
the
parties
here
are
more
private
that
state.
in
fact,
not
all
paternity
suits
have
state
involvement.
only
those
in
which
the
child
is
on
welfare
have
state
involvement.
some
would
argue,
as
appellant
has,
that
the
state
is
putting
pressure
on
the
mother
to
put
the
finger
on
someone.
perhaps
that
is
how
some
people
view
it.
i
submit,
however,
a
fairer
way
to
view
it
is,
the
state
is
watching
out
for
the
child's
best
interests.
in
some
instances
the
child
and
mother
may
assume
somewhat
of
an
adversarial
role.
the
mother
may
still
care
for
the
father
and
not
wish
to
jeopardize
that
relationship.
the
father
may
be
paying
some
voluntary
support
and
the
mother
may
not
wish
to
jeopardize
that
support.
the
mother
may
be
very
young
and
intimidated
by
the
legal
proceeding
or
the
legal
system,
precluding
her
from
taking
any
steps
to
establish
the
civil
legal
relationship
between
the
child
and
the
father.
furthermore,
the
state
does
have
a
responsibility
to
the
taxpayers
of
the
state
to
recoup
some
of
the
money
that
is
being
used
to
support
a
child
that
is
born
out
of
wedlock.
i
would
therefore
ask
that
for
the
state
of
pennsylvania
that
this
court
affirm
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
and
hold
that
the
preponderance
of
evidence
standard
of
proof
chosen
by
pennsylvania
and
41
other
states
to
be
used
in
paternity
suits
does
not
violate
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution.
