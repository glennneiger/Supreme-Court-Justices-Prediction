mr.
william
watt
campbell
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
man
can
be
determined
to
be
the
father
of
an
illegitimate
child
with
the
associated
stigma
and
impact
on
himself
and
his
family
by
the
same
quality
of
proof
as
is
used
in
the
ordinary
civil
case.
the
paternity
case
is
not
like
an
ordinary
civil
case
about
money,
as
my
opponents
would
have
you
believe.
a
paternity
case
is
not
like
a
collection
case
or
a
slip
and
fall
case.
if
you
look
at
the
effects
of
the
judgment
entered
and
the
parties
involved,
you
will
see
the
difference.
first
of
all,
this
judgment
is
enforced
by
jail.
this
is
not
a
judgment
which
is
enforced
just
against
the
debtor's
property,
but
it
is
enforced
against
him.
once
the
order
is
entered,
the
court
monitors
his
address
and
his
employment
for
the
remainder
of
the
effect
of
that
order.
there
is
a
wage
attachment
provision,
and
this
is
a
provision
that
does
not
exist
in
any
other
civil
judgments
in
pennsylvania.
week
to
week,
paycheck
to
paycheck,
the
effect
of
this
judgment
is
felt.
there
is
no
relief
in
bankruptcy.
the
defendant
loses
the
freedom
to
change
his
employment
based
on
a
court's
perception
of
his
earning
capacity.
he
can't
go
from
a
salaried
position
to
self-employment.
he
can't
bankrupt
out
of
this
judgment,
but
none
of
these
deal
with
the
most
important
effect
of
this
judgment.
this
judgment
makes
a
permanent
decision
as
to
who
is
the
father
of
this
child.
the
parties
involved...
i
will
get
back
to
that.
the
parties
involved
are
entirely
different.
plaintiff's
interest,
as
my
opponents
concede,
is
purely
economic,
getting
money.
but
the
child
has
what
has
been
termed
in
little
versus
streeter
as
a
compelling
interest
in
the
accuracy
of
the
determination
and
so
does
the
defendant.
the
government
weighs
in
heavily
on
the
side
of
the
plaintiff
in
every
support
and
paternity
case,
not
just
the
welfare
cases,
as
here,
but
through
the
4d
program,
this
plaintiff
and
all
plaintiffs
in
support
actions
have
been
afforded
postponed
and
reduced
filing
fees,
streamlined
pleading
systems,
subsidized
costs
of
prosecution,
and
there
are
two
examples
in
this
case
which
are
of
particular
interest.
in
this
case
the
government
provided
the
plaintiff
with
an
attorney
and
the
government
flew
in
the
blood
test
expert
for
the
trial
at
no
cost
to
the
plaintiff.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
chief
justice
rehnquist,
the
4d
program
is
the
popular
name
for
the
provision
of
the
social
security
act
through
which
the
federal
government
funds
the
child
support
enforcement
programs
in
the
50
states.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
it
is
a
title
of
the
statute,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
no.
no,
sir.
and
finally,
with
reference
to
the
difference
in
the
nature
of
the
parties
in
a
civil
action,
the
child,
who
is
the
one
who
is
supposed
to
be
the
beneficiary
of
the
money,
and
the
one
who
bears
the
effect
of
the
decision
of
paternity,
is
not
even
a
party.
this
welfare
support
case
was
begun
under
government
compulsion.
jean
marie
minnich
was
required
to
name
a
father
and
cooperate
in
a
prosecution
of
someone
in
order
to
get
welfare
benefits,
so
these
cases
aren't
just
like
the
ordinary
money
case.
it
may
start
as
a
case
seeking
money,
but
where
paternity
is
at
issue
the
defendant's
freedom
of
personal
choice
in
family
matters
is
implicated.
now,
this
court
has
dealt
with
this
freedom
of
choice
most
usually
in
terms
of
an
existing
family
unit,
but
for
two
reasons,
logically
and
otherwise,
that
freedom
must
include
the
freedom
not
to
become
a
parent
by
a
judicial
determination.
furthermore,
whatever
the
merits
of
the
ultimate
issue
of
abortion,
in
roe
versus
wade
this
court
recognized
the
freedom
of
someone,
in
that
case
a
pregnant
woman,
not
to
continue
to
term,
not
to
become
a
parent
because--
mr.
william
watt
campbell
--justice
scalia,
i
would
respectfully
disagree
with
that.
there
is
the
harm
of
the
unwanted
relationship.
our
society
does
not
take
the
label
of
father
lightly.
we
do
not
want
to
assume
that
in
every
case
where
someone
is
determined
to
be
the
father
you
pay
the
money,
you
don't
have
to
do
anything
else,
society
does
expect
people
who
are
named
as
fathers
to
be
fathers.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
justice
scalia,
it
is
correct
that
a
lot
of
those
expectations
cannot
be
enforced,
but
legally
enforceable
expectations
aren't
the
only
considerations
that
have
been
taken
into
account.
in
santosky
versus
kramer,
the
court
considered
many
interests
of
parents
which
are
not
judicially
enforceable.
you
cannot
make
a
parent
raise
their
children
morally
or
make
sure
they
go
to
school
after
high
school
if
that
is
appropriate
for
them,
but
still
the
court
considered
the
role
of
a
parent
as
our
society,
as
our
society
expects,
and
not...
the
court
doesn't
just
look
to
money.
the
other
family
matters
which
are
implicated
in
a
paternity
case
are,
as
i
have
said,
the
harm
of
an
unwanted
relationship,
and
the
harm
of
this
judicially
determined
relationship
on
an
existing
family.
in
this
case
my
client
is
married
and
has
a
child
of
that
marriage.
through
this
determination
he
can
be
labeled
as
an
adulterer.
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
in
considering
the
state
law
noted
that
he
would
have
a
responsibility
for
the
health,
wealth,
and
education
of
the
child,
which
may
go
beyond
legally
enforceable
money
considerations.
most
important,
perhaps,
is
that
this
is
a
final
and
irreversible
determination
of
who
this
child's
father
is,
and
for
the
child
there
are
interests
in
terms
of
determining
what
is
the
heritage
of
the
child,
what
is
the
medical
and
genetic
history,
and
finally
the
emotional
and
psychological
impact.
it
defies
common
sense
and
common
experience
to
try
to
tell
this
court
that
saying
someone
is
the
father
will
only
result
in
the
payment
of
money.
that
child
is
going
to
have
someone
identified
to
them
as
the
father.
that
is
why
the
child
has
that
compelling
interest
in
the
accuracy.
it
will
have
lifelong
consequences
far
beyond
any
$20
per
week.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
yes,
i
do.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
it
is
true--
mr.
william
watt
campbell
--it
is
true
that
there
are
risks
of
error
in
either
direction,
but
a
child
will
be
harmed
by
an
erroneous...
a
child
will
be
harmed
either
way,
but
when--
mr.
william
watt
campbell
--the
kind
of
evidence
the
plaintiff
must
use
to
prove
their
case
calls
for
an
increased
burden
of
proof
in
order
to
instruct
the
factfinder
to
proceed
more
cautiously
so
that
we
may
have
more
confidence
in
the
decision.
the
three
kinds
of
evidence
i
am
about
to
discuss
were
all
used
in
this
case,
because
if
the
plaintiff
loses
they
lose
money
if
the
defendant
loses,
there
are
lifelong
ramifications.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
absolutely
not,
justice
scalia.
the
preponderance
standard
says
that
if
you
look
at
the
evidence
and
you
decide
that
the
plaintiff
has
proved
her
claim
more
likely
than
not
by
weight
to
the
slightest
degree
then
you
must
find
in
favor
of
the
plaintiff.
you
have
said
they
would
find
against
even
though
they
believed
it.
that
is
not
right.
the
clear
and
convincing
standard
would
tell
them
you
may
find
him
to
be
the
father
if
you
are
clearly
convinced
of
the
truth
of
her
claim,
and
let's
look
at
the
kinds
of
evidence
that
is
used
in
paternity
cases
to
make
this
claim.
the
blood
tests.
in
this
case
the
blood
test
results
were
18
to
1,
94.6
percent.
now,
what
this
means
is
that
if
i
walked
out
of
the
lancaster
county
courthouse,
turned
down
duke
street,
and
picked
up
19
hispanic
males
at
random,
one
of
them
could
be
the
father,
and
if
i
went
further
and
picked
up
38,
there
could
be
two
of
them.
in
a
group
of
57
hispanic
males
just
in
that
town
alone
there
could
be
three
biologically
possible
fathers.
this
statistical
evidence
is
very
difficult
to
understand
for
lawyers.
i
suggest
it
is
much
more
difficult
for
juries.
that
is
why,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
mills,
the
traditional
evidence
becomes
more
important.
when
we
look
at
that
evidence,
that--
mr.
william
watt
campbell
--no,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
believe
that
may
be
the
practice
in
some
states,
but
in
pennsylvania
these
probability
results
in
the
hla
blood
test
are
admissible
in
any
case.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
eighteen
to
one,
that's
right.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
well,
the
reason
i
have
not
asked
for
the
beyond
the
reasonable
doubt
standard,
i
think
there
is
some
language
in
addington
versus
texas
which
would
explain
why
it
would
not
be
appropriate
for
me
to
do
that
because
of
the
use
of
scientific
evidence.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
well,
all
the
probability,
all
the
probability
results
do
is
supposedly
help
the
jury
consider
the
rest
of
the
evidence.
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
mills,
once
you
get
into
cases
where
there
is
a
probability
where
the
man
is
not
excluded,
you
are
in
trial,
and
you
look--
mr.
william
watt
campbell
--the
blood
tests
results
were
expressed
in
two
fashions.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
an
18
to
1
odds
that
he
was
the
father.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
right.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
one
out
of
19.
there
was
one
out
of
every
group
of
19
hispanic
males
capable
of
impregnating
a
woman,
one
of
them
could
be
the
father
based
on
blood
samples
taken
from
the
three
parties.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
eighteen
to
one....
mr.
william
watt
campbell
not
that
he
was
the
father,
but
that
a
person
with
his
blood
characteristics
was
the
father.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
therefore
you
go
over
into
the
traditional
evidence,
who
did
what
to
whom
and
what
happened
nine
months
later,
and
i
think
it
is
a
statement
that
has
been
often
repeated,
it
is
a
statement
that
is
about
30
years
old,
but
it
is
very
accurate.
there
are
not
eye
witnesses
in
paternity
cases,
and
that
statement
is
that
social
pressures
conspire
to
produce
silence
or
deliberate
falsity
in
these
kinds
of
cases.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
94.6
percent,
which
only
means
that
94.6
percent
of
hispanic
males
aren't
the
father,
5.4
percent
could
biologically
be
the
father,
and
as
this
ama-aba
report
that
everybody
talks
about,
all
the
opinions
of
this
court
discussing
blood
tests
have
cited
this,
as
they
point
out,
there
are
a
lot
of
statistical
assumptions
in
this
case
which
raise
possible
due
process
issues,
and
i
submit
that
this
is
one
such
issue.
the
third
kind
of
evidence,
something
that
was
done
in
this
case
and
something
that
according
to
my
research
can
be
done
around
the
country,
the
plaintiff
was
permitted
to
bring
my
client
up
in
front
of
the
jury,
put
the
baby
and
the
mother
next
to
him,
and
ask
the
jury
to
look
to
see
if
they
could
see
a
resemblance.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
justice
marshall,
that
is
not
required
by
pennsylvania
law.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
well,
it
is
not
permitted...
it
is
not
done
any
more.
these
three
kinds
of
evidence
each
contain
opportunities
to
snow
the
jury,
to
confuse
the
jury.
what
is
the
best
way
to
tell
the
jury
to
proceed
with
caution?
the
best
way
is
to
set
the
basic
rule,
and
the
basic
rule
should
be
contained
in
the
burden
of
proof.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
no,
i
have
not.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
i
think
it
is.
whenever
there
is...
a
burden
of
proof
can...
a
burden
of
proof
may
be
set
by
the
legislature
but
as
each
of
the
burden
of
proof
cases
here
have
said,
only
within
the
confines
of
the
due
process
clause.
i
suggest
they
didn't
think
about
it
when
they
took
it
from
a
criminal
prosecution
to
a
civil
prosecution
and
i
was
unable
to
locate
any
legislative
history
whatsoever
on
the
point.
now,
my
opponents
say
that
this
case
just
reduces
to
money
and
urge
the
court
only
to
see
the
dollar
sign
in
this
paternity
order.
they
distinguish
santosky
as
protecting
a
family
unit,
and
that
this
just
concerns
one
person.
constitutionally
there
is
just
as
much
at
stake
here
as
there
was
in
santosky
because
santosky
was
not
written
to
protect
ozzie
and
harriet.
santosky
was
written
to
protect
john
and
annie
santosky,
who
were
two
people
whose
children
had
already
been
taken
away
from
them
based
on
allegations
and
some
preliminary
findings
of
abuse
and
neglect.
what
this
court
protected
was
general
concept
of
parenting,
what
it
is
to
be
a
parent,
and
what
it
is
to
be
a
parent
is
just
as
much
at
stake
in
a
paternity
case
as
it
is
in
a
termination
case.
to
say
otherwise
would
diminish
society's
expectation
of
what
is
it
to
be
a
father.
i
ask
this
court
to
caution
the
factfinder
to
proceed
in
these
cases
with
great
deliberation
and
to
use
the
clear
and
convincing
standard.
i
will
reserve
my
remaining
time.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
a
few
brief
remarks
in
rebuttal.
first
of
all,
the
quote
from
webber
was
very
nice,
but
what
is
at
question
here
is
not
an
irresponsible
liaison.
the
question
is,
did
it
ever
happen,
and
did
it
result
in
a
parent.
so
those
cases
have
nothing
to
do
with
this
case.
those
cases
and
the
adoption
cases
involve
people
who
say
they
are
the
father
and
the
children's
rights
and
the
fathers'
rights.
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
determining
whether
or
not
someone
actually
is
the
father
of
a
child.
chief
justice
rehnquist,
you
asked
whether
an
18
to
1
odds
was
a
low
likelihood
or
a
high
likelihood
or
what
could
it
be,
and
as
i
pointed
out
there
is
no
statute
saying
below
a
certain
result
you
can't
admit
the
results,
but
in
the
ama-aba
study
which
i
believe
this
court
is
familiar
with
due
to
the
numerous
times
it
has
been
cited
there
is
a
table
showing
degrees
of
likelihood,
and
starting
with
practically
proved,
extremely
likely,
very
likely,
and
in
the
90
to
95
percent
range,
which
is
where
the
18
to
1
falls,
it
says
likely.
i
think
the
court
should
be
aware
of
that.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
that's
right,
but
in
this
case,
just
another
example
of
why
there
is
tough
evidence
in
this
case,
in
this
case
i
tried
to
show
that
gregg's,
my
client's
brother,
had
opportunity
and
access
to
have
sex...
this
was
one
of
the
contentions
we
were
trying
to
show...
that
he
had
sex
with
her,
so
he
could
be
the
father,
and
as
indicated
in
the
reporter
cases
and
could
have
been
in
this
case,
blood
test
results
don't
mean
anything
else
if
somebody
else
had
sex
with
the
woman
who
was
related.
mr.
william
watt
campbell
excuse
me?
mr.
william
watt
campbell
yes,
the
jury
rejected
it
but--
mr.
william
watt
campbell
--that's
right,
and
by
a
preponderance--
mr.
william
watt
campbell
--that's
correct.
just
to
make
absolutely
sure--
mr.
william
watt
campbell
--i
am
sorry,
justice
marshall?
mr.
william
watt
campbell
that
is
why
i
am
here,
justice
marshall.
the
18
to
1
again,
that
only
means
that
out
of
19
randomly
selected
hispanic
males
one
could
be
the
father.
it
means
nothing
more.
finally,
as
to
the
state's
involvement
in
nonwelfare
cases,
although
this
is
a
welfare
case,
i
want
to
point
out
again
the
state
is
heavily
involved
in
each
and
every
support
case
as
the
ama-aba
guidelines
point
out.
thank
you.
