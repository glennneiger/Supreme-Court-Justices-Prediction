we
will
hear
arguments
next

jean
marie
minnich.
mr.
campbell,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
do
the
four
d's
stand
for,
mr.
campbell?
chief
justice
rehnquist
oh,
it
refers
to
a
section
of
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
it
is
not
like
4r?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
the
blood
test
evidence
that
you
have
just
described,
is
that
admissible
no
matter
how
little
probative
it
may
be
of
the
defendant's
paternity?
i
mean,
is
it
like
a
drunken
driving
statute
where
you
have
to
have
a
certain
minimum
before
it
is
admissible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
campbell.

will
hear
now

many
states,
ms.
barton?
chief
justice

in
this
18

19
to
1
findings,
is
that
considered
a
high
probability
as
these
things
run,
or
medium,
or
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
barton.
mr.
campbell,
you
have
14
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
you
are
at
94.6,
so
you
are
fairly
close
to
95.

justice

h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
campbell.

case
is
