justice
scalia
mrs.
christian,
what
does
it
mean
to
say,
as
you
just
have,
that
the
statute
does
not
require
any
particular
valuation
methodology
so
long
as
it
produces
real
market
value.
what
does
that
mean?
i
mean,
if
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
decide
this
uniformly
presumably
they're
going
to
have
to
use
one
methodology.
the
reason
you
use
different
methodologies
is
that
they
tend
to
produce
different
results.
now
there's
a
broad
range
of
results
which
you
might
say
are
fair
even
though
the
methodologies
come
up
with
different
outcomes,
you
can
say
well,
they're
different
but
it's
arguable
that
any
one
of
them
is
the
fair
market
value.
but
when
the
federal
courts
are
going
to
have
to
review
it
to
determine
whether
it
is
in
fact
the
fair
market
value,
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
uniform
federal
methodology.
aren't
we
getting
the
federal
courts
involved
in
federal
railroad
rate
making
and
in
order
to
do
that
doesn't
there
have
to
be
some
standard
federal
methodology
if
your
case
is
correct?
justice
scalia
which
one
produces
the
fair
market
value?
when
they
come
out
with
different
results
we
have
a
statute
that
says
fair
market
value.
you
tell
us
that
federal
courts
have
to
determine
what
is
fair
market
value.
we
have
three
different
methodologies.
each
of
them
produce
significantly
different
figures.
which
is,
will
the
true
fair
market
value
please
stand
up.
how
do
you
know
which
one
of
them
is
the
true?
justice
scalia
so
you
concede
then
that
all
the
federal
court
would
have
to
do
is
use
whatever
methodology
the
state
used,
assuming
that
was
a
reasonable
methodology?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
--would
the
federal
court
give
any
deference
to
the
state's
judgment
on
those
matters,
or,
in
other
words,
would
the
federal
court
be
reviewing
the
state's
rate
making
or
assessments
similar
more
or
less
the
way
it
would
review
a
rate
making
by
the
icc,
giving
the
agency
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
or,
does
the
federal
court
have
to
de
novo
make
those
determinations?
justice
scalia
it's
a
lot
of
work.
justice
scalia
how
do
you
square
that
with
your
concession
that
you
have
to
accept
whatever
method
of
valuation
the
state
uses.
justice
scalia
how
about
within
the
range
of
reasonable
ones
you
have,
you
say
we
have
to,
the
federal
court
has
to
accept
the
methodology
that
the
state
chooses.
why
wouldn't
you
by
similar
logic
have
to
say
that
within
the
possible,
reasonable,
factual
outcomes
you
have
to
accept
whatever
factual
outcome
the
state
chooses.
justice
scalia
and
i
think
they
will
lead
to
the
result,
the
same
results
system
wide.
but
if
you
have
a
railroad
system
that's
going
through
several
states
the
result
that
they
might
produce
in
a
particular
state
could
vary
significantly,
couldn't
it?
justice
scalia
or--
justice
scalia
--well,
i'm
including
that
in
the
methodology
though.
i
mean,
you
say
on
the
basis
of
track
miles
or
some
other
technique.
isn't
that
part
of
the
whole
methodology?
how
much
you
allocate
to
the
state.
justice
scalia
oh.
justice
scalia
i
see.
well
what
about
that?
does
the
federal
court
have
to
accept
the
method
of
allocation
that
the
state
uses?
justice
scalia
what
if
it's...
but
there,
but
you
know,
i
mean
there
are
a
lot
of
different
reasonable
ways
of
allocating.
i
really
want
to
know
what
the
railroads
expect
the
federal
courts
xxx.
justice
scalia
there
normally
will
be
over
the
allocation.
justice
scalia
the
thing
doesn't
really
work
if
you
read
it
literally
and
if
you
assess
the
property
higher
but
tax
it
at
a
lower
rate.
you
follow
me?
justice
scalia
there
would
not
be
any
discrimination
against
the
railroad
if
although
you
violated
subsection
a
by
assessing
the
property
too
high.
nonetheless,
you
tax
it
at
a
lower
rate.
justice
scalia
you
taxed
it
at
a
lower
rate,
the
railroad
property
at
a
lower
rate.
you
assess
it
higher,
but
tax
it
lower.
justice
scalia
it
would
still
violate
a
wouldn't
it,
even
though
the
railroad
isn't
being
discriminated
against.
justice
scalia
one
would
hope
not.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
mr.
lauber--
justice
scalia
--do
you
agree
with
mrs.
christian
as
to
what
has
to
be
accepted?
that
the
federal
court
has
to
accept
any
manner
of
assessment
adopted
by
state,
methodology
adopted
by
the
state
if
it's
a
reasonable
one?
justice
scalia
i
understand.
but
more
in
the
range
of
reasonable-ones,
the
federal
court
has
to
accept
whatever
the
state
applies?
justice
scalia
and
what
about
the
factual
determinations
under
each
of
those?
you
don't
give
any
deference
to
the
state
on
those,
but
you
do
on
which
methodology?
justice
scalia
whatever.
justice
scalia
any
deference
to
the
state?
justice
scalia
any
deference
to
the
state
if
there
are
various
reasonable
positions
that
could
be
taken.
justice
scalia
well,
that
isn't
what
she
said.
she
didn't
say
that
there
wouldn't
be
disagreement,
she
said
that
the
difference
in
the
methodologies
would
not
necessarily
produce
great
disagreement.
justice
scalia
i
think
you're
right.
it
doesn't
make
much
sense
to
me.
isn't
it
true
that
it's
rather
strange
to
have
a
statute
which
says
you
can't
discriminate
intentionally
beyond
doing
so
for
five
percent?
that's
a
very
strange
statute.
i
mean,
that
five
percent
requirement
doesn't
seem
to
me
to
go
along
at
all
with
the
notion
that
intentional
discrimination
is
the
only
thing
that
it's
directed
at.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
i
can
see
two
different
statutes.
statute
one
says,
no
intentional
discrimination.
i
can
see
another
one
that
says,
doesn't
matter
whether
the
discrimination
is
intentional
or
not,
just
so
long
as
it's
no
more
than
five
percent.
but
here
you're
telling
us,
or
the
10th
circuit
was
telling
us
that
you
have
a
statute
which
says
you
can't
intentionally
discriminate
beyond
five
percent.
you
can
intentionally
discriminate
five
percent,
that's
okay.
why
would
you
write
a
statute
like
that?
that's
very
strange.
justice
scalia
why
would
it
make
any
sense
to
conduct
the
inquiry
of
fair
market
valuation
of
non-railroad
property,
if
you
don't
have
the
authority
to
conduct
fair
market
valuation
of
railroad
property?
justice
scalia
well
what
difference
does
that
make?
the
fact
that
you
prescribe
a
means
by
which
it
is
to
be
done,
does
not
show
why
it
is
at
all
useful
to
do
it,
if
you
don't
do
it
for
the
railroad
property
as
well.
justice
scalia
because
the
ratio
depends
upon
the
comparison
of
the
one
to
the
other.
and
you're
telling
us
the
federal
courts
can
inquire
into
the
valuation
of
the
non-railroad
property
and
it
doesn't
matter
what
that
valuation
ends
up
as
because
we're
only
looking
for
a
ratio.
it's
only
a
ratio
that's
important
not
an
absolute.
but
then
you
tell
us
we
can
look
into
the
fair
market
valuation
of
the
railroad
property.
so
then
what's
achieved
doing
fair
market
valuation
of
this
other
property?
nothing.
justice
scalia
i
know
it's
easy,
but
what's
the
purpose
of
doing
it?
justice
scalia
i
see
what
you
mean.
justice
scalia
but
generally--
justice
scalia
[laughter]
justice
scalia
not
working
for
the
railroads
now,
is
he?
[laughter]
president
of
the
railroad.
mr.
lee,
i
don't
understand.
i
guess
we
probably
ought
to
have
the
10th
circuit
here.
nobody
likes
the
10th
circuit's
position,
right?
justice
scalia
i
understand.
[laughter]
if
i
understand
your
case
correctly,
you...
you
acknowledge
that
federal
courts
have
to
get
into
the
evaluation
of
commercial
and
industrial
property,
there
is
no
way
to
avoid
that
under
your
interpretation
of
the
statute?
justice
scalia
well,
they
told
them
how
to
do
it,
but
sometimes
that
doesn't
work.
and
then
they
have
to
conduct
a
full
fledged
investigation
into
the
value
of
commercial
and
industrial
property,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
whatever,
i
mean.
justice
antonin
scalia
but,
i'm
sure
you
can
evaluate
railroad
property
by
a
ratio
study
or
by
some
other
study.
i
mean
you're
just
talking
about
the
methodology
of
valuation.
but
the
fact
is
that
the
interpretation
you're
urging
on
us
tells
us
that
federal
courts
were
under
this
statute
given
the
authority
to
come
to
their
own
decision
about
the
value
of
non-railroad
property,
but
they
are
to
close
their
eyes
to
the
valuation
of
railroad
property.
that
just
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
result
when
what
you're
worried
about
is
discrimination
against
the
railroads.
justice
scalia
now
how
do
you
explain
the
burden
of
proof
provision?
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
true
market
value
shall
be
that
declared
by
the
applicant.
that
only
applies
to
true
market
value
of
other
commercial
and
industrial
property,
is
that--
justice
scalia
--no,
i'm
not
sure
you
answered
my
question.
you
assert
that
that
burden
of
proof
provision
only
applies,
the
reason
it's
in
there
is
because
you
have
to
determine
the
true
market
value
of
non-railroad
property.
