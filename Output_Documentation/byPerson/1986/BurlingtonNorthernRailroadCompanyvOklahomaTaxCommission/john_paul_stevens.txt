justice
stevens
may
i
ask
before
you
leave
the
methodology
point.
what's
wrong
with
the
methodology
in
this
case?
justice
stevens
in
other
words,
both
methodologies
were
permissible
but
they
were
misapplied
in
this
particular
case
for
the
reason--
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
general
lee
on
that,
you
mentioned
the
other
states'
cooperation.
when
you
have
the
initial
valuation
of
the
railroad
which
has
multi-state
operations
and
you
all,
as
i
understand
the
procedure,
you
start
with
the
total
value
and
then
you
apportion
a
part
to
the
taxing--
justice
stevens
--jurisdiction.
do
the
states
have
some
common
agency
for
determining
what
the
value
is
and
do
they
all
start
with
the
same
figure
or
does
each
state
go
about
it
separately?
justice
stevens
it
does?
justice
stevens
you
don't
use
a
multi-state
tax
commission
approach
of
any
kind?
justice
stevens
isn't
it
true
that
most
states
start
with
a
system-wide
value
figure
and
then
work
back
from
that?
justice
stevens
so
if
we
got
a
case
involving
this
particular
railroad
from
kansas
or
missouri,
we
might
find
a
dramatically
different
figure
as
the
starting
point?
justice
stevens
--what
you're
saying,
if
i
understand
you
is
that
in,
i'm
thinking
in
terms
of
burden
on
the
courts
and
the
like,
that
it
would
be
permissible
for
the
railroad
to
come
in
and
say
that
the
state
has
to
follow
the
general
policy
of
undervaluing
all
other
commercial
and
industrial
property,
and
that's
how
they
get
a
10.87
ratio,
because
they're
really
undervalued
it
all.
and
so
they
could
prove,
they
could
try
to
prove
what
you've
done
in
all
other
types
of
property
to
show
that
your
level
was
generally
lower
than
it
should
have
been.
justice
stevens
i
thought
that
was
what
you
just
said?
justice
stevens
didn't
you
say
that
it
is,
the
issue
of
the
valuation
of
non-railroad
commercial
property
can
be
addressed
by
a
federal
court?
justice
stevens
and
the
reason
for
doing
it
would
be
to
show
that
that
property
was
all
undervalued?
is
that
not
correct?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
but
it's
35
percent
of
x,
of
true
market
value.
but
if
they
proved
that
your
true
market
value
people
went
out
and
regularly
used
out
of
date
figures
or
didn't
take
obsolescence
into
account,
and
consistently
came
up
with
a
lower
figure
than
the
experts
would
say
was
appropriate
that
would
be
the
converse
of
what
they're
alleging
here?
justice
stevens
as
i
understand,
you're
saying
that
would
be
permissible.
justice
stevens
i
thought
all
she
said
was
that
there
are
three
general
methodologies
that
are
used
and
both
the
states
and
the
railroads
all
agree
that
any
one
of
the
three
is
generally
acceptable.
they
may
be
misapplied
in
particular
cases
and--
justice
stevens
--i
suppose
once
he's
decided
it
for
1982,
it
probably
wouldn't
be
as
hard
to
do
it
in
1983.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
i
mean
you've
got
some
basic
disagreements
that
probably
would
be
ironed
out
after
a
few
years,
i
would
think.
justice
stevens
it
is
correct,
is
it
not
that
your
1982
value
was
a
great
deal
higher
than
your
1981
system
value,
a
$2
billion
to
$3.5
billion--
justice
stevens
--however
he
arrived
at
it,
that
was
the
final
figure
that
the
tax
was
based
on,
wasn't
it?
justice
stevens
absent
the
negotiation
it
would
have
been
$3.6.
justice
stevens
did
he
retain
his
position
after...--
[laughter]
