mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
10th
circuit
invented
its
intentional
discrimination
test
in
order
to
solve
what
it
perceived
to
be
a
problem
with
the
statute.
the
problem
it
perceived
was
that
letting
federal
courts
inquire
into
the
true
market
value
of
railroad
property
would
unduly
interfere
with
state
taxing
prerogatives
and
would
burden
the
federal
courts,
both
by
increasing
their
work
load
and
by
requiring
them
to
undertake
difficult
or
inappropriate
tasks.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well
i
hope
to
show
that
they
are
not
both
true.
i
think
that
mrs.
christian
has
shown
that
the
intentional
test
was
a
wrong
solution
and
i
hope
to
show
there
was
really
no
problem
to
begin
with.
in
fact,
section
306
is
a
limited
measure
that
congress
carefully
designed
to
avoid
intruding
on
state
tax
prerogatives
to
the
greatest
possible
extent
consistent
with
achieving
the
objective
of
eradicating
discrimination
against
railroads.
first
of
all,
congress
enacted
a
three
year
delay
in
the
effective
date
of
the
statute
to
avoid
any
kind
of
shock
effect
on
the
states
and
to
give
them
plenty
of
time
to
bring
their
law
into
compliance
with
the
statute.
secondly,
congress
adopted
in
the
statute
the
state's
rules
governing
burden
of
proof
as
to
true
market
value
and
that
means
the
railroad
is
going
to
have
to
shoulder
whatever
difficulties
are
inherent
in
proving
true
market
value.
thirdly,
the
statue
only
bars
discriminatory
overvaluation
of
railroad
property.
thus,
the
railroad
can't
come
into
federal
court
as
if
it
were
a
home
owner
and
simply
argue
that
my
property
has
been
assessed
too
high
in
absolute
terms.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
of
the
discrimination?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
it
comes
from
the
fact
that
you
have
these
two
fractions,
the
two
assessment
ratios
that
have
to
either
be
equivalent
or
not.
the
railroad
has
got
to
show
that
its
property
has
been
over-valued
vis-a-vis
non-railroad
property.
that
is
the
test
for
discrimination.
this
mathematical
disparity
of
the
two
fractions.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right.
when
congress
defined
discrimination
in
objective
terms
as
a
disparity
in
these
two
assessment
ratio
fractions.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
exactly
right.
so
a
mere
overvaluation
per
se
is
not
a
cause
of
action.
we
must
have
relative
over-valuation.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well
assessed
value--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--at
a
higher
ratio.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
xxx
assess
it,
it
means,
yes
the
value--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well
what
the
two
fractions
represent
is
perfect
equalization.
you
have
these
two
fractions
of
assessed
value
over
fair
market
value
for
railroads
and
everybody
else.
and
the
statute
says
those
must
be
equal.
that
is
equalization.
and
we
think
the
court
has
got
to
look
at
both
denominators
of
each
fraction,
to
figure
out
if
those
fractions
are
equal
or
not,
if
there
is
equalization.
and,
getting
the
value
right
for
both
the
railroads
and
everybody
else
is
a
necessary
step
in
getting
the
fractions
right
and
seeing
if
they're
equal
or
not.
and
that's
what
the
federal
court,
we
think,
has
got
to
do.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well,
taxing
at
a
higher
rate--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
rate
disparity
is
a
separate
offense
xxx.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
it
could
be--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
could
be
a
railroad
might,
a
railroad
might
be
able
to
defend,
the
state
might,
be
able
to
defend
on
the
ground
that
any
over-assessment
was
cured.
any
relative
over-assessment
was
cured
by
a
rate
disparity,
but
frankly
that
was
not
the
problem
congress
had.
i
mean,
there
was
never
a
case
in
history
where
railroads
were
taxed
at
a
lower
rate
than
everybody
else.
it
simply,
historically
was
not
the
problem
we
were
dealing
with.
furthermore,
even
after--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--even
after
a
railroad
proves
discrimination
in
objective
terms,
the
court
cannot
grant
relief
unless
the
railroad
proves
that
the
disparity
in
the
two
assessment
ratios
is
greater
than
five
percent.
this
five
percent
tolerance
factor
was
plainly
designed
by
congress
to
keep
out
trivial
or
de
minimis
disputes
about
overvaluation
and
to
keep
the
federal
court
jurisdiction
confined
to
relatively
egregious
cases
of
discrimination.
now
as
far,
fifthly,
the
statute
grants
the
court
jurisdiction
only
to
enjoin
the
discriminatory
portion
of
the
tax,
not
the
entire
tax.
and
that
means
that
the
state
can
then
go
on
to
assess
and
collect
the
balance
of
the
tax
so
there
will
be
no
interruption
of
its
main
revenue
flow.
now
as
to
the
burden
on
the
federal
courts
there
have
been
only
about
three
dozen
cases
brought
under
section
306
as
a
whole
in
the
eight
years
since
the
statute
became
effective.
whereover
only
about
ten
of
those
have
involved
overvaluation
claims
of
the
kind
involved
here.
that
is
so
even
though
only
the
10th
circuit
has
imposed
a
threshold
intent
test
as
a
means
of
discouraging
the
bringing
of
overvaluation
claims.
we
don't
think
ten
lawsuits
in
eight
years
is
particularly
burdensome
on
the
federal
courts.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
the
statute
would
permit
that.
i
mean,
it
doesn't
speak
to
it.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
oh,
so
you're
saying
if
state
law
itself
imposed
a
clear
and
convincing
burden
of
proof
that
would
be--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--incorporated
into
federal
law.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
don't
think
that
was
the
intent
of
the
statute.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well
i
would
read
that,
the
words
"with
respect
to
the
determination
of.
"
simply
to
refer
to
who
has
the
burden
of
proof,
not
to
the
manner
in
which
you
must
discharge
your
burden
of
proof.
i
don't
know
if
congress,
and
like
i
said,
history
discussed
this
question,
but
the
thrust
of
the
statute
was
to
have
the
federal
court
undertake
de
novo
review
of
this
because
congress
was
convinced
that
the
deck
was
stacked
against--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--well,
the
problem
is
that
the
state
could
then
have
it
be
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
and
kind
of
get
at
the
railroads
that
way.
and
that
would
completely
defeat
the
purpose
of
the
statute.
i
mean,
congress
thought,
the
reason
they
let
the
federal
courts
take
on
these
cases
is
because
they
thought
the
deck
was
stacked
against
the
railroads
in
the
states
and
that
the
state
assessment
boards
didn't
give
them
a
fair
shake
and
they
state
courts
rubber
stamped
what
the
assessment
boards
did.
and
if
you
let
the
state
gin
up
an
impossible
burden
of
proof
standard
and
then
bring
it
into
federal
court
it
would
be
quite
a
nugatory
remedy
that
congress
can't
really
have
intended.
so
i
would
read
this
as
referring
to
simply
who
has
the
burden
of
proof.
let
me
make
one
other
point
about
what
i
think
is
a
fundamental
flaw
in
the
other
side's
position.
they
would
agree
that
if
a
railroad
had
an
undervaluation
claim,
that
is
that
its
property
was
valued
okay
but
everybody
else's
was
too
low
that
it
can
bring
that
claim
to
federal
court.
now
it
could--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--it
could
very
well
be
that
the
state
would
respond
by
saying
yes.
well
in
fact,
we
have
undervalued
other
people's
property,
but
we've
also
undervalued
your
property.
we
think
we
made
mistakes
in
assessing
your
property
originally
and
we
would
like
to
prove
that
we
undervalued
your
property
by
an
equal
degree
and
therefore
you
have
not
proven
discrimination.
we
think
that
a
state
could
surely
do
that.
the
state,
we
think,
could
definitely
interject
the
true
market
value
of
railroad
property
into
litigation
as
a
defense
to
an
undervaluation
claim.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
if
that
is
right,
it
would
be
crazy
if
the
railroad
couldn't
do
the
same
thing.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
would
agree
that
there
are
probably
some
methodologies
like
underappreciated
book
cost,
that
simply
would
be
ridiculous.
but
i
think
there
is
xxx--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--i
would
say
it
ought
to
accept
it.
it
should
listen
to
arguments
that
they're
out
of
line,
but
ought
to
normally
accept
the
state's
methodology.
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
well
generally
speaking,
you
won't
really
have
a
lot
of
factual
determinations
about
how
much
is
that
hopper
car
worth.
it'll
be
more
accounting
questions.
should
you
be
given
an
obsolescence
allowance?
what's
the
proper
capitalization
rate?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
under
those
questions
the
court
would
hear
expert
testimony
about
what
the
icc
would
require,
the
federal
tax
law
would
require--
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
--pardon
me?
mr.
albert
g.
lauber,
jr.
i
would
think
there
would
be
no
deference
to
the
state
on
the
subsidiary
questions.
