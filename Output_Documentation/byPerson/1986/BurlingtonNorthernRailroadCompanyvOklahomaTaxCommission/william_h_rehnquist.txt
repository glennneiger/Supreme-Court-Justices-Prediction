chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i'll
proceed
with
the
arguments
in
burlington
northern
v.
oklahoma
tax
commission.
mrs.
christian.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mrs.
christian,
there
is
a
pretty
well
recognized
distinction
in
state
property
tax
law
isn't
there
between
valuation
relief
or
valuation
and
equalization?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
why
do
you
think
they're
misleading
and
confusing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
had
thought
that
valuation
was
the
determining
what
the
fair
market
value
of
the
property
was
and
that
equalization
meant
the
desire
to
assess
at
the
same
percentage
of
fair
market
value
all
classes
of
property.
do
you
think
that's
wrong?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
why
do
you
think--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--why
do
you
think
the
terms
are
misleading
then?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
as
you
have
used
the
term
and
perhaps
as,
i
think
i
have
used
it
the
same,
do
you
find
that
confusing?
chief
justice
rehnquist
your
claim
here
is
that
306
section
28(a)
was
violated.
chief
justice
rehnquist
1(a).
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mrs.
christian.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lauber.
chief
justice
rehnquist
where
do
you
find
this
requirement
in
the
statute,
mr.
lauber?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
then
you're
not
using
discrimination
in
any
intentional
sense
at
all.
chief
justice
rehnquist
a
disparity
is
what
you're--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--so
your
point
is
if
all
the
property
in
the
state
is
valued
wrong,
but
it's
not
done
in
any
way
that
discriminates
against
the
railroad
that
would
not
be
an
object
of
xxx.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
did
you
read
the
word
assessment,
the
second
word
in
subsection
(a)
as
being
the
same
as
valuation?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
it
doesn't
say
assessed
value.
it
says
assessment
of
transportation
property.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why
doesn't
that
refer
to
the
equalization
process
rather
than
the
valuation
process?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lauber.
mr.
lee,
we'll
hear
now
from
you.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
does
the
federal
judge
when
he
hears
all
these
experts,
simply
sit
as
a
finder
of
fact
and
decide
what
he
thinks
the
right
value
is?
chief
justice
rehnquist
clearly
the
statute
rules
that
out,
doesn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
wouldn't
the
14th,
or
wouldn't
the
equal
protection
clause
give
the
railroads
some
constitutional
claim
in
the
event
of
intentional
discrimination
and
without
the
4-r
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
even
in
a
showing
of
intentional
discrimination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
86-337,
burlington
northern
railroad
company
vs.
oklahoma
tax
commission
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
