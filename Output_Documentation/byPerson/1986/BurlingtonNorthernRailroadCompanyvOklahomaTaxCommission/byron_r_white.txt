justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
i
take
it
that
the
earlier
burlington
case
in
kansas,
with
respect
to
kansas--
justice
white
--i
thought
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
this
kind
of
a
suit
would
be
entertained
if
the
railroad
could
make
out
a
decent
claim
of
intentional
and
purposeful
overvaluation?
justice
white
well,
isn't
it
almost
inherent
in
your
claim
that
it
was
intentional.
justice
white
well,--
justice
white
--was
there
a
finding
about
intentional
discrimination
in
this
case?
justice
white
so
they
said
with
discriminatory--
justice
white
--and
so,
both
courts
seemed
to
say
that
even
if
there
was
overvaluation
it
wasn't
discriminatory,
intentionally
discriminatory?
justice
white
and
promptly
raised
the
valuation.
[laughter]
justice
white
you
didn't,
you
mean
you
raised
it,
but
not
immediately.
justice
white
then
why
are
the
railroads
complaining?
justice
white
do
you
agree
that
if
the
railroad
made
a
decent
case
out
of
the
fact
that
there
was
an
intentional
overvaluation
of
their
property
that
you
could
really
inquire
into
the
reasonableness
of
the
valuation?
justice
white
well,
yes
or
no.
do
you--
justice
white
--i
would
think
you're
argument
would
say
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
what
they
allege.
they
have
to
allege
a
difference
in
the
assessment
ratio
or
they're
out
of
court.
justice
white
so
you
don't
defend
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
10th
circuit
then
in
that
respect?
justice
white
well
that
sounds
like
what
they
mean.
justice
white
i
would
think
you
really
take
this
10th
circuit
seriously
in
saying
that
it's
open
to
proof
whether
there
was
an
intentional
overvaluation,
intentional
discriminatory
overvaluation.
i
would
think
that
part
of
the
evidence
would
be
what
the
valuation
was.
because
if
it
was
gross
enough
you
certainly
could
infer
an
intent.
justice
white
and
so
i,
so
i
just
don't
understand
the
10th
circuit--
justice
white
--saying
that
you
can't
get
into
valuation,
but
you
can
get
into
intent.
