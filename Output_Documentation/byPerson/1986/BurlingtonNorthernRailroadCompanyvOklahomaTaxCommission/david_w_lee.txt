mr.
david
w.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
petitioner
in
this
case,
burlington
northern
has
filed
this
federal
lawsuit
asking
a
federal
district
court
to
enjoin
the
oklahoma
tax
commission
and
the
oklahoma
state
equalization
board
from
assessing
ad
valorem
tax
based
on
what
burlington
northern
claimed
was
an
overvaluation
of
its
property
for
the
year
1982.
the
federal
district
court
dismissed
this
case
finding
after
reviewing
affidavits
and
interrogatories
and
depositions
submitted
by
the
railroad
and
the
state
that
the
only
dispute
was
over
the
value
that
the
state
was
placing
on
the
railroad's
property.
the
10th
circuit
affirmed
that
ruling
holding
that
section
306
of
the
4-r
act
which
clearly
gives
the
federal
district
court
the
authority
to
equalize
assessment
ratios
and
tax
rates
that
are
being
applied
to
railroad
property
does
not
give
a
federal
court
the
right
to
revalue
the
railroad's
property
and
become
what
the
10th
circuit
has
previously
referred
to
as
state
assessment
boards.
it
is
our
contention
that
congress,
in
fact,
never
did
intend
for
a
federal
court
to
become
a
state
assessment
board,
a
fact
that
is
supported
by
the
language
of
the
act
and
by
its
legislative
history.
of
course,
i
speak
not
only
for
oklahoma
in
this
regard
but
also
on
behalf
of
23
other
states
who
ask
this
court
to
reject
the
petitioner's
interpretation
of
section
306
which
would
cause
massive
federal
court
intrusion
into
their
state
revenue
gathering
processes.
i
agree
with--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
lee
the
valuation
of
a
railroad
varies
from
state
to
state.
mr.
david
w.
lee
and
also--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--no,
there
is
tremendous
disagreement
with
the
methodology
that
should
be
applied
and
i--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
start
with
the
unit
appraisal
method
which
has
been
noticed
by
this
court
previously
in
the
rowley
case
in
1934.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
i
think
it
so.
and
i
disagree
with
what
mrs.
christian
said
that
there
would
be
a
close
agreement
on
what
the
true
market
value
would
be
with
regard
to
the
experts.
there
has
been
a
tremendous
disagreement
between
experts
in
this
present
case
as
to
what
the
true
market
value
of
the
railroad
would
be.
the
railroad's
expert
filed
an
affidavit
saying
that
the
true
market
value
of
the
railroad
would
be
$1.4
billion.
we
filed
an
affidavit
by
an
outside
appraiser,
mr.
goodwin,
who
has
done
appraisal
for
kansas
that
said
the
true
market
value
of
the
railroad
would
be
$3.4
billion.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
our
methodology
that
we
used
in
1981,
we
attributed
25
percent
to
the
income,
kevlaw's
income
method.
the
next
year
we
moved
up
to
40
percent.
they
filed
an
affidavit
saying
they
disagreed
with
that.
now
we're
up
to
giving
60
to
90
percent
to
the
capitalized
income.
i
disagree
with
her
when
she
says
that
there
is
not
much
disagreement
about
methodology.
and,
of
course,
that's
why
we
feel
like
that
it's
our
contention
that
a
federal
court
should
not
make
these
decisions.
and
we
think
that
congress
never
intended
for
a
federal
court
to
make
that
decision.
i
agree
with
mrs.
christian,
that
the
critical
portion
of
this
statute
is
the
subsection
(1),
subparagraphs
(a)
and
(b)
by
my
reading
make
it
unlawful
to
apply
a
different
assessment
ratio
to
railroad
property
than
is
applied
to
similar
commercial
and
industrial
property
in
that
jurisdiction
and
to
collect
a
tax
based
on
that
unequal
assessment.
subparagraph
three
prohibits
a
state
from
applying
a
different
ad
valorem
tax
rate
to
railroad
property.
subparagraph
(d)
is
a
catch
all
provision
prohibiting
unspecified
and
un-named
taxes
from
being
discriminatorily
applied
to
railroad
property.
and
i
agree
with
mrs.
christian
that
their
dispute,
their
contention
falls
within
subparagraph
(a).
they're
claiming
that
their
overvaluation
can
be
interpreted
from
subsection
(a),
section
306.
however,
we
contend
that
nowhere
in
section
306
and
in
particularly
in
subsection
(a)
does
the
law
give
a
federal
court
the
authority
to
revalue
the
value,
redetermine
the
value
of
a
railroad
property
for
ad
valorem
tax
purposes.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
david
w.
lee
we
think
that--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--we
think
that
they
meant
the
inquiry
into
true
market
value
is
to
be
made
only
with
regard
to
a
determination
of
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study.
they
set
forth
a
specific
means
of
determining
what
the
appropriate
assessment
ratio
that
is
being
used
and
being
applied
to
non-railroad
property
is
in
that
jurisdiction.
and
they
specified
the
specific
manner
of
making
that
determination,
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study.
that's
a
means
of
determining
the
value
of
property
by
looking
at
a
sampling
of
sales
that
have
taken
place
in
a
county
and
comparing
it
with
the
assessed
value.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes.
congress
specifically
said
that
if
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study
is
not
adequate
then
the
court
can
conduct
its
own
study,
or
adopt
whatever
study
it
thinks
is
appropriate.
mr.
david
w.
lee
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
that's--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
we
think
that
this
is
not
a
plain
meaning
case.
we
think
that
the
statute
is
not
clear
as
to
what
exactly
it
means.
there
was
tremendous
confusion
all
15
years
in
congress
as
to
what
these
various
bills
would
mean.
we
think
there's
a
particularly,
early
on
in
the
legislation
there's
a
letter
from
then
deputy
attorney
general
warren
christopher--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--if
you
take
that
single
sentence
out
of
context.
but
this
court
in
the
kelly
v.
robinson
case
with
regard
to
interpretation
of
federal
bankruptcy
laws
with
regard
to
their
impact
on
criminal
justice
systems
said
that
in
interpreting
a
statute
like
this
you
don't
take
a
single
sentence
out
of
the
context
of
the
statute,
you
look
at
the
entire
statute
and
its
object
and
its
policy.
we
think
that
looking
at
subsection
(a)
in
conjunction
with
the
rest
of
the
statute
which--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--we
think
the
congress
was
advised
that
there
were
only
two
problems
with
the
way
that
railroads
were
being
treated.
one
with
the
regard
to
the
assessment
ratio
that
was
being
applied
to
railroad
property
and
the
other
was
with
the
unequal
taxation
rights.
that
was
the
entire
testimony
given
throughout
the
15
years.
i
disagree
with
mrs.
christian
when
she
said
that
mr.
lanier
wrote
a
letter
later
on
saying
that
this,
that
it
meant
to
cover
valuation.
that's
mentioned
on
page
11
of
her
reply
brief,
but
you
read
the
entire
letter
and
he
also
says
in
that
letter
that
the
legislation
would
not
mean
to
change
the
judicial
review
that
is
being
applied
to
state
taxation
systems.
so
we
think
that
congress
was
confronted
with
two
problems,
they
crafted
a
statute
which
deals
with
these
problems
and
set
forth
the
specific
means
for
dealing
with
equalizing
assessment
ratios.
and
we
think
that
the
fact
that
they
were
silent
when
they
had
gone
into
such
detail
about
prescribing
the
means
of
determining
the
assessment
ratio,
that
their
silence
and
the
fact
that
they
didn't
even
talk
about
what
proper
methodology
is
to
be
used
by
a
federal
court
in
determining
the
value
of
the
railroad
is
very
significant.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
i
think
that's
the
concern
of
the
10th
circuit
and
why
they
said
what
they
did
with
regard
to
their
rule.
that
there
is
a
showing
of
purposeful
discrimination
with
intent.
they
meant
to
insure
if
they
intentionally
retaliated
against
a
railroad
because
of
earlier
success
with
regard
to
4-r
legislation
that
they
wouldn't--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well
we,
kansas
spoke
to
this
in
detail
in
their
amicus
brief
and
they
felt,
their
contention
was,
and
we
agree
with
it,
that
a
federal
court
sits
as
a
court
of
equity
and
if
there
has
been
a
blatant
or
an
egregious
retaliation
or
circumvention
of
the
assessment
ratio
equalization
requirements
that
a
federal
court
should
not
cover
its
eyes
to
that
and
can
act
to
prevent
a
state
from
doing
that.
and
we
think
that's
what
the
10th
circuit
was
doing.
we
have
problems
with
that
rule
though
because
we
fear
that
it
would
allow
the
railroad
in
every
case
to
delve
into
the
subjective
intentions
of
our
taxing
authorities.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
and
we
think--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
we
think
that
the
five
percent
provision
of
the
statute
refers
strictly
to
equalization
of
the
assessment
ratio.
and
we
agree
that
equalization
is
a
common
legal
term.
it
has
a
meaning
in
our
state
under
our
state
law
with
regard
to
our
county
assessors
and
our
state
equalization
board.
we
think
that
the
five
percent
gives
the
states
five
percent
flexibility
in
equalizing
the
assessment
ratio
of
commercial
property
with
that
of
the
railroad.
that
give
in
the
statute,
we
think
it
applies
strictly
to
equalizing
assessment
ratios
and
has
nothing
to
do
with
overvaluation.
we
think
that
was
congress's
intention
and
we
think
that
the
legislative
history
supports
our
rating.
and
what
i've
said
here,
i
think
is
a
reasonable
explanation
of
the
statute
which
is
squares
and
is
supported
by
the
fifteen
years
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
act.
and--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
because
they
prescribe
the
means
by
which
that
the
inquiry
into
the
true
market
value
of
non-railroad
property
is
to
be
made.
the
sales
assessment
ratio's
study
which
is
done
by
sampling.
the--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study
is
a
sampling.
it's
a
very
easy
way
to
determine
what
is
the
uniform
assessment
ratio
that
has
been
established
for
non-railroad
property.
mr.
david
w.
lee
because
that
sets
the
standard
that
the
federal
court
is
to
look
at
in
equalizing
the
ratio
that
is
to
be
applied
to
non-railroad
property
with
that
of
railroad.
they
said,
here
is
what
the
federal
judge
is
to
do.
he's
supposed
to
conduct
a
trial
on
what
is
the
proper
sales
assessment
ratio
study
and
there
has
been
litigation
about
what
components
comprise
that.
do
you
include
personal
property
into
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study?
do
you
include
centrally
assessed
property
in
it?
do
you
use
the
weighted
means,
or
the
median,
or
the
mean
in
conducting
it.
once
you
have
a
trial
on
that
the
federal
judge
either
adopts
what
the
state
has
done,
and
in
oklahoma
we
do
one
every
year.
and
in
this
case
there
is
no
disagreement
with
our
sales
assessment
ratio
study
and
what
came
out
with
as
10.7
percent.
and
once
that's
been
established
then
the
federal
judge
just
simply
looks
to
the
assessment
ratio
that's
being
applied
to
railroad
property
and
equalized
and
that
is,
there
is
a
lot
of
discussion
in
congressional
history
about
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study.
it's
of
no
value
whatsoever
with
regard
to
valuation
of
a
railroad
because
railroads
don't
sell.
and
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study
is
a
good
indicator
of
true
market
value
because
you
look
at
the
selling
price
of
a
random,
of
pieces
of
property
in
the
counties
and
that's
what
true
market
value
is.
and
then
you
compare
that
with--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--the
assessed
value
and
you
come
out
with
a
ratio.
mr.
david
w.
lee
and
our
state
wide
ratio
is
10.87
percent.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
i
don't
think
they
can.
i
don't
think
we
said
that
in
our
brief.
mr.
david
w.
lee
no.
mr.
david
w.
lee
that's
correct.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
i
guess
if
you
mean
assessment
value
as
being
undervaluation--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--you're
correct.
assessed
value
by
our
state
law,
our
state
constitution,
you
cannot
assess
property
in
excess
of
35
percent.
mr.
david
w.
lee
so
all
properties
under--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
a
trial--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
a
trial
on
the
validity
and
the
proper
ratio
as
determined
by
a
sales
assessment
ratio
study
has
not
been
a
problem
and
there
has
been
some
litigation
about
it,
but
it's
just
not
anything
compared
to
what
would
follow
if
the
federal
courts
were
allowed
to
look
at
the
entire
methodology
that
a
state
has
applied.
and
i
disagree
with
mrs.
christian
when
she
said
that
they're
going
to
defer
to
what
the
state
has
done
generally
with
regard
to
the
methodology.
that
has
not
been
done
at
all.
they
affidavits
submitted--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well
there
have
been
disagreements
about
how
much
weight
to
accord
each
one
of
them
within
the
different
methodologies
and
income
value
indicators
there's
enormous
disagreement,
tremendous
disagreement.
and
this
court
has
recognized
itself
as
recently
as
the
norfolk
case
in
1968,
this
is
just
an
estimation
of
value.
and
in
our
case
the
total
bottom
line
has
disagreed,
there's
been
enormous
disagreement
about.
the
same
way
in
the
9th
circuit
and
the
same
way
with
the
8th
circuit.
all
the
litigation
that's
taken
place
so
far
with
regard
to
valuation
methodology
and
valuation
litigation
has
been
extremely
complex.
it
amounts
to
a
federal
judge
just
listening
to
expert
witnesses
testify
about
incredibly
complex
methodology
for
the
railroad
and
then
listening
to
the
outside
appraisers
on
behalf
of
the
state
testifying.
and
then
the
judge
having
to
make
a
decision
based
on
things
that
are
tremendously
complex
and
are--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
that
depends.
i
mean
value
on
all
property
differs
from
year
to
year.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
in
this
particular
case
the
railroad
said
that,
they
said
that
we
disagree
with
what
they're
saying
about
our
valuation
of
the
property.
they're
saying
that
we've
valued
it
at
$2.1
billion.
we're
saying
that
the
valuation
was
$3.6
billion.
mr.
david
w.
lee
that's
what
they
want.
and
that's
what
we
think
is
one
of
the
great
problems
with
this
and
we
think
that
congress,
when
they
asked
mr.
lanier
and
mr.
ogden
about
this
they
said,
no
that's
not
what
would
happen.
we
only
want
equalization
of
assessment
ratios.
we
only
want
equalization
of
tax
rates.
and,
of
course,
this
practice
has
gone
on
because
the
supreme
court
in
1940
in
the
nashville
v
browning
case
said
it
was
okay
for
states
to
classify,
to
give
different
assessment
ratios
to
different
classification
of
property
xxx.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes.
there
is
no
question.
we
agree
and
we've
done
that.
we
lowered
our
assessment
ratio
that
was
being
applied
to
railroads
from--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--no,
we
didn't
do
that.
we
didn't
do
that.
our
full
system
valuation,
and
i
know
there's
a
dispute
about
what
the
record
reveals--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--no,
we
didn't.
no.
[laughter]
it
has
gradually
gone
down,
our
valuation
has
gradually
evolved
in
the
direction
that
they
wanted,
the
railroads
want
more
weight
to
be
given
to
the
capitalized
income
indicator
of
value.
we
started
at
25
percent
in
1981
and
we've
slowly
evolved
in
the
direction
they
want
it
because
it
lowers
the
full
system
value
of
their
railroad.
and
every
year,
'81,
'82,
our
full
system
value
and
assessed
value
and
taxes
imposed
on
the
railroad
have
gone
down.
so
the
4-r
act
has
worked
with
regard
to
lowering
the
tax
burden
on
states,
on
railroads.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
because
they
want
more.
they
made
their
agreement
with
congress
and
now
they're
trying
to
get
considerably
more
out
of
the
courts.
and
what
they're
arguing
now
is
completely
different
than
what
they
told
congress
for
years.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
we
think
there's
a
real
problem
with
that.
in
this
case--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--no,
we
don't.
mr.
david
w.
lee
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
we've
had
a
real
problem
and
this
particular
case
demonstrates
what
could
happen.
in
this
case
all
of
three
of
our
tax
commissioners
were
deposed,
had
lengthy
depositions
about
the
methodology
that
was
used.
mr.
david
w.
lee
if
it's
interpreted
in
such
a
way
which
would
allow
them
every
year
to
delve
into
the
intention
of
our
tax
commissioners
or
our
ad
valorem
division
director--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
we
can
live
with
the
lennen
rule
if
it's
properly
applied
and
if
the
same
protections
with
regard
to
summary
judgment
are
given
to
our
tax
officials
that
are
given
to
public
employees
generally--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--i
don't
think
so.
i
think
the
browning
case
in
1940
eliminated
an
equal
protection
clause,
a
challenge
with
regard
to
that.
mr.
david
w.
lee
i,
your
honor,
i
really
think
that
and
the
fair
assessment
case
in
1982
mean
that
they
really
can't
do
that.
that
the
only
relief
they
can
get
is
from
section
306.
it's
more
relief
than
other
taxpayers
have.
we
have
a
number
of
other
taxpayers
in
oklahoma,
public
utilities
that
are
taxed
on
the
unit
system
valuation
who
go
through
our
state
system
and
go
through
our
state
procedures.
and
the
10th
circuit
noted
that
there
was
no
claim
in
this
particular
case
that
our
state
procedures
were
inadequate.
what
they,
they
got
back
their
valuation
and
they
went
directly
and
filed
a
federal
lawsuit
against
us.
mr.
david
w.
lee
yes.
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well
we
think
that--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--yes.
we
think
that
there
would
be
a
situation
that
overvaluation
would
be
such
that
it
would
meet
the
test
in
the
norfolk
case
in
1986
that
if
the
state
is
shown
to
be
grossly
over-reaching,
or
if
there
is
not
a
rational
basis
for
what
they've
done.
but
in
this
case
the
valuation
that
we
did
was
under
the
book
value
of
the
railroad.
and
just
because
they
want
to
use
a
methodology
which
would
give
them
a
lower
value
for
the
railroad,
we
don't
think
that
they
should
be
able
to
go
to
federal
court
and
get
a
federal
judge
to
agree
with
them.
mr.
david
w.
lee
that's
where
we
have
a
disagreement.
they
have
used
the
figure
$2.1
billion
which
we
don't
think
they
should
be
using.
what
happened
was
that
was
a
negotiated
figure.
the
original
valuation
that
was
sent
out
to
the
railroad
was
based
on
a
$3.6
billion
figure
which
the
appraisers
had
done.
burlington
northern
asked
for
a
negotiation
conference
with
mr.
barr,
who
was
the
ad
valorem
tax
division
director
at
that
time.
they
had
a
conference
and
he
just
got
the
book
value
of
the
railroad
which
was
$4.2
billion
and
during
the
process
of
the
negotiations,
wrote
off
50
percent
for
obsolescence.
just
gave
them
a
50
percent
break
on
obsolescence
and
moved
the
assessment
ratio--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--yes,
but--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--well,
he
said
even
in
his
deposition
that
the
valuation
of
that
railroad
is
$3.6
billion.
he
said
that
the
$2.1
billion
is,
and
they
get
that
only
from
his
handwritten
notes,
computations
he
made
during
this
negotiation
conference.
mr.
david
w.
lee
no.
the
deposition
of
mr.
nance
makes
clear
that
that
was
one
of
the
reasons
why
mr.
barr
is
no
longer
the
head
of
the
ad
valorem
division--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--is
because
he
was
engaging
in
these
and
they--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--we
like
it
better
than
the
8th
and
the
9th.
mr.
david
w.
lee
but
congress
told
them
how
to
do
that.
mr.
david
w.
lee
well,
or
they
could
adopt
another
ratio
study.
i
mean,
they
might--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--appoint
their
own
appraiser
to
conduct
a
ratio
study.
mr.
david
w.
lee
it's
consistent
with
the,
with
what
congress
intended.
because
there
were
discussions
in
congress
about
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study
and
how
that's
conducted
and
of
how
that
cannot
be
done
with
regard
to
railroads,
because
railroads
don't
sell.
they
don't
sell
like
regular
commercial
and
industrial
property.
so
it's
very
easy
to
do
a
sales
assessment
ratio
study
and
set
the
standard
and
then
equalize
the
assessment
ratio
that
is
to
be
applied
to
railroads
with
that
that
the
ratio
study
that
are
previously
being
conducted.
if
the
federal
court
doesn't
think
that
it's
a
good
ratio
study
it
can
adopt
its
own,
or
listen
to
experts
that
might
have
a
better
one.
but,
like
i
say,
in
our
case
there
was
no
disagreement
with
it.
our
assessment
ratio
was
10.8
percent.
it's
relatively
low.
the
railroads
have
never
challenged
that
as
the
assessment
ratio.
and
it's
resulted
in
decreasing
assessment
values
and
taxes
every
year.
and
we
are
changing
our
methodology
in
accordance
with
what
they
want.
we're
giving
more
weight
to
the
capitalized
income
method.
they
didn't
like
the
fact
and
we
got
sued
because
we
didn't
give
them
this
enormous
break
for
obsolescence
that
they
got
from
mr.
barr
for
that
one
year.
that's
why
they--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--but
the
next
sentence
says
that
if
the
correct
ratio
cannot
be
established
by
using
the
sales
assessment
ratio
study
then
the
federal
court
is
to
be
left
on
its
own.
the
clinchfield
case
out
of
the
fourth
circuit--
mr.
david
w.
lee
--that's
correct.
and
it's
who
has
the
burden
of
proof
under
state
law.
and
as
i
was
saying,
the
clinchfield
decision
out
of
the
fourth
circuit
has
a
very
good
discussion
of,
under
north
carolina
law
in
that
case,
they
said
that
the
taxpayer
has
the
burden
of
showing
the
proper
assessment
ratio
which
is
to
be
used.
