ms.
betty
jo
christian
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
interpretation
of
section
306
of
the
railroad
revitalization
and
regulatory
reform
act
of
1976.
this
act
was
passed
by
congress
in
response
to
a
major
financial
crisis
in
the
railroad
industry.
in
addition
to
providing
an
immediate
infusion
of
federal
funds,
the
act
took
the
first
steps
toward
deregulation
at
the
federal
level
and
placed
restrictions
on
the
powers
of
the
states
with
respect
to
the
railroads.
in
section
306,
congress
declared
state
tax
discrimination
against
railroads
to
be
an
undue
burden
on
interstate
commerce
and
in
an
express
exception
to
the
tax
injunction
act,
granted
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
to
remedy
any
violations.
the
key
substantive
provision
is
section
306(1),
which
appears
at
page
20-a
to
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
certiorari.
subsection
1
declares
that
it
is
unlawful
for
the
states
to
engage
in
any
of
a
series
of
prohibited
acts.
subsection
a
and
b
are
directed
to
the
assessment
of
railroad
property
at
a
percentage
of
that
property's
true
market
value
which
is
higher
than
the
percentage
of
assessed
value
to
true
market
value
of
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
subsection
c
is
directed
to
and
prohibits
tax
rights
which
are
higher
for
railroads
than
for
non-railroad
property
and
subsection
d
prohibits
any
other
tax
which
results
in
discriminatory
treatment
of
a
railroad.
the
specific
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
section
306
gives
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
a
claim
of
tax
discrimination
resulting
from
the
overvaluation
of
a
railroad's
property.
in
its
complaint
in
this
case,
burlington
northern
alleged
that
in
1982
the
state
of
oklahoma
had
over-valued
its
property.
and
that
as
a
result
of
that
overvaluation,
its
property
had
been
assessed
at
a
percentage
of
assessed
value
to
true
market
value
which
was
higher
than
the
percentage
of
assessed
value
to
true
market
value
for
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
the
district
court
dismissed
the
complaint
for
lack
of
jurisdiction.
the
10th
circuit,
relying
on
its
own
prior
decision
in
the
lennen
case
upheld
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
holding
that
generally
section
306
does
not
grant
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
state
tax
discrimination
which
results
from
overvaluation
of
a
railroad's
property.
it
carved
out
one
exception
holding
that
the
federal
courts
would
have
jurisdiction
if
the
railroad
could
make
a
strong
showing
prior
to
trial
of
purposeful
overvaluation
with
discriminatory
intent
and
upheld
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
burlington
northern's
affidavits
have
failed
to
make
such
a
showing.
the
same
issue
has
been
considered
by
two
other
circuits.
both
the
8th
circuit
and
the
9th
circuit
have
held
that
section
306
grants
the
federal
courts
jurisdiction
over
all
claims
of
state
tax
discrimination,
specifically
including
discrimination
resulting
from
the
overvaluation
of
a
railroad's
property
and
that
no
showing
of
discriminatory
intent
is
required.
before
i
turn
to
the
text
of
the
statute
i
believe
it
is
important
to
emphasize
one
point
and
that
is
that
it
is
clear
from
the
reports
of
congress
that
its
goal
in
enacting
this
statute
was
to
put
an
end
to
state
tax
discrimination
against
railroads.
as
a
practical
matter,
discrimination
can
result
just
as
readily
from
the
overvaluation
of
the
railroad's
property
as
it
can
from
undervaluation
of
other
commercial
and
industrial
property
or
from
higher
tax
rates.
thus
if
section
306
does
not
encompass
discrimination
which
results
from
overvaluation
of
the
railroad's
property
the
statute
will
be
left
with
a
gaping
hole
and
will
not
accomplish
its
purpose.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
believe
that
those
terms
are
misleading
and
confusing,
mr.
chief
justice.
because
we--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--equalization
essentially
refers
to
equalizing
the
percentages
of
assessed
value
to
true
market
value.
now,
the
need
for
equalization
can
arise
either
from
the
undervaluation
of
commercial
and
industrial
property
or
the
overvaluation
of
the
railroad's
property.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
no,
it
is
directed
to
the
desire
to
assess
at
the
same
percentage
of
true
market
value--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--all
classes
of
property
but--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--the
petitioners,
the
respondents
in
this
case
have
used
the
term
equalization
as
synonymous
with
undervaluation.
we
believe
that
equalization
refers
to
the
process
of
reaching
the
same
percentage
of
assessed
value
to
true
market
value
for
all
classes
of
property.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
no,
not
as
we
have
used
the
term
here.
turning
now
to
the
text
of
the
statute,
we
believe
that
the
section
30c
on
its
face
encompasses
federal
court
jurisdiction
over
discriminatory
assessments
which
result
from
overvaluation
of
railroad
property.
subsection
1(a),
on
its
face
prohibits
the
assessment
of
transportation
property
at
a
value
which
bears
a
higher
ratio
to
the
true
market
value
of
that
property
than
the
ratio
of
assessed
value
to
true
market
value
of
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
the
only
way
that
the
district
court
can
determine
whether
that
requirement
has
been
met
is
to
make
a
determination
as
to
what
is
the
assessed
value
and
what
is
the
true
market
value
of
both
railroad
property
and
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
this
is
the
only
way
that
the
district
court
can
determine
the
percentages
to
make
the
mathematical
comparison
required
by
the
statute.
and
indeed,
in
subsection
2(d)
of
the
statute
it
goes
on
to
provide
that
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
both
assessed
value
and
true
market
value
shall
be
that
declared
by
applicable
state
law.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
to
indicate
that
this
does
not
apply
to
a
determination
of
the
true
market
value
of
the
railroad
property
as
well
as
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
the
only
textual
support
offered
by
the
10th
circuit
for
its
conclusion
that
the
district
court
must
accept
the
true
market
value
found
by
the
state
as
determinative
and
may
not
make
its
own
inquiry
into
the
facts,
is
the
fact
that
there
is
a
proviso
to
subsection
2(e)
that
prescribes
a
particular
sampling
technique
for
use
in
the
valuation
of
other
commercial
and
industrial
property.
but
that
carries
no
connotation
that
the
true
market
value
of
railroad
property
is
not
to
be
determined
at
all
and
indeed
that
the
very
proviso
of
subsection
2(e)
goes
on
to
provide
that
in
the
event
the
true
market
value
of
the
other
commercial
and
industrial
property
cannot
be
decided,
be
determined
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
court
through
the
sales
assessment
ratio,
the
sampling
technique,
then
the
comparison
should
be
made
to
the
true
market
value
of
all
other
property.
and
just
as
in
the
case
of
the
railroad
property
there
is
no
direction
as
to
how
that
determination
should
be
made.
we
believe
that
the--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--subsection
1(a),
that
is
correct.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
is
correct,
mr.
chief
justice.
we
believe
that
the
language
of
the
statute--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--we
do
not
believe
that
that
is
a
correct
characterization
of
what
the
railroad
witnesses
actually
said,
justice
o'connor.
what
the
railroad
witnesses
who
were
quoting,
quoted
by
respondents
actually
were
saying
is
that
the
statute
does
not
require
any
uniform
valuation
methodology.
this
is
an
entirely
different
matter
from
saying
that
the
court
cannot
inquire
into
true
market
value.
and
indeed
the
statute
does
not
prescribe
a
particular
methodology
of
valuation.
states
are
free
to
use
any
methodology
they
choose
as
long
as
it
results
in
true
market
value.
in
particular
the
witness
most
frequently
cited
by
respondents,--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--mr.
lanier,
expressly
stated
in
written
testimony
subsequent
to
the
oral
exchanges
recited
by
respondents
that
in
his
view
the
valuation
of
railroad
property
would
be
an
issue.
this
same
opinion
was
expressed
by
the
interstate
commerce
commission
and
by
various
congressional
sponsors
of
the
bill.
beyond
this,
justice
o'connor,
it
is
apparent
that
the
states
themselves
did
not
interpret
mr.
lanier
and
other
railroads'
testimony
at
the
time,
as
constituting
any
promise
that
railroad
valuation
would
not
be
an
issue
because
subsequent
to
those
remarks
the
states
continued
to
vehemently
oppose
enactment
of
this
legislation,
stating
as
one
of
their
principal
reasons
the
fact
that
it
would
require
the
federal
courts
to
become
involved
with
state
railroad
property
valuation.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
i
see
no
reason
why
that
would
necessarily
be
the
result,
justice
scalia.
in
valuing
railroads
virtually
all
states
use
what
is
called
the
unitary
method.
that
is
they
determine
a
value
for
the
system
wide
property
of
the
railroad.
and
there
are
generally
three
methodologies
which
are
in
common
use
by
virtually
all
states.
the
original
cost
depreciated
method,
capitalized
income
and
the
stock
and
bond
method.
now
the
burlington
northern
and
the
railroads
generally
have
never
taken
the
position
that
any
one
of
these
is
the
only
appropriate
methodology.
indeed
most
states
adopt
a
weighting
of
two
or
sometimes
three.
the
state
of
oklahoma
uses
a
weighting
average
of
original
cost
depreciated
and
the
capitalized
income
methodologies.
now,--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--first,
justice
scalia,
if
properly
applied
all
of
these
methodologies
will
yield
results
that
are
very
close
together.
not
identical
perhaps,
but
there
should
not
be
any
wide
range
if
they
are
applied
properly
and
the
appropriate
adjustments
are
made
to
take
into
account
the
facts
of
the
particular
situation.
what
the
district
court
would
do
would
be
to
hear
expert
testimony,
witnesses
produced
by
both
the
state
and
the
railroad
with
respect
to
the
application
of
the
various
methodologies
to
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
before
him
and
then
make
a
determination
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
in
that
particular
case
what
the
true
market
value
has
been
shown
to
be
with
the
burden
of
proof
as
imposed
by
state
law
which
would
normally
be
with
the
railroad
carrying
the
burden
of
proof.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
we
think
the
door
would
have
to
be
open
for
the
railroad
to
challenge
a
particular
methodology
as
not
being
a
reasonable
methodology.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
but
given
that
caveat,
yes
his
role
would
be
to
determine
on
the
basis
of
the
evidence
before
him,
which
would
include
the
evidence
of
the
state's
expert
and
the
railroad's
expert
as
to
whether
these
methodologies
have
been
properly
applied.
it
would
not
necessarily
result
in
any
uniform
methodology
of
revolving.
i
would
like
to
turn
now
very
briefly
to
the--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--in
this
case,
burlington
northern
would
be
raising
two
contentions.
first
with
respect
to
the
capitalized
income
of
methodology
as
applied
by
the
state
of
oklahoma.
it
is
burlington
northern's
contention
that
the
capitalization
rate
chosen
by
the
state
was
improper
because
it
does
not
accurately
reflect
the
actual
experience
of
cost
of
capital
for
the
railroads
in
this
time
period.
with
respect
to
original
cost
depreciated,
burlington
northern's
position
is
that
the
state
of
oklahoma
in
1982
erred
by
refusing
to
apply
a
deduction
to
take
account
of
the
fact
that
much
of
its
property
is
now
obsolete
because
it
was
built
decades
ago
for
other
traffic,
despite
the
fact
that
it
had
granted
such
a
deduction
for
obsolescence
in
past
years.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
in
this
particular
case,
burlington
northern
is
claiming
that
they
were
misapplied.
very
briefly
before
you--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--the
federal
court
has
to
de
novo
make
those
determinations.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
it
would
of
course
determine
on
the
basis
of
the
experience
and
expertise
of
the
individual
expert
witnesses
what
degree
of
deference
should
be
given
to
each
witness
but
it
would
not
give
deference
to
the
state
merely
because
it
was
the
state.
indeed,
one
of
the
principal
bases
for
congress'
enactment
of
this
legislation
was
stated
to
be
its
perception
of
the
inadequacies
of
state
remedies.
and
one
of
those
inadequacies
to
which
it
specifically
pointed
was
the
fact
that
the
states
determination
was
generally
accorded
a
presumption
of
validity
xxx--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--justice
scalia,
we
certainly
remain
free
to
challenge
a
particular
valuation
as
totally
unreasonable.
but
there--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--justice
scalia,
i
apologize
if
i
said
the
state
would
have,
the
court
would
have
to
accept
the
methodology.
certainly
the
railroad's
witnesses
would
be
free
to
state
that
they
believe
other
methodologies
were
preferable.
but
generally,
in
most
cases,
the
methodologies
used
by
the
state
and
by
the
railroads
are
essentially
one
of
the
three
that
we
have
just
discussed
and
if
properly
applied
they
will
essentially
lead
to
the
same,
to
the
result
of
true
market
value.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
the
states,
justice
scalia,
do
the
valuation
of
the
railroad
property
on
a
system
wide
basis
and
then
they
allocate
a
portion
of
that
to
the
state
on
the
basis
of
track
miles,
or
some
other
technique.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
so
that
the
valuation
of
each
state
is--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--that
is
not
normally
considered
a
part
of
the
methodology.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
would
be
considered
something
separate.
the
allocation.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
in
this
particular
case,
justice
scalia,
there
is
no
challenge
as
to
the
allocation
factor
and
that
is
true
of
all
of
the
cases
i'm
familiar
with.
but
i
would
think
the
railroad
would
have
to
be
free
to
challenge
the
allocation
if
it
is
unreasonable.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
the
railroads
expect
the
federal
courts
to
engage
in
a
de
novo
determination
of
whether
the
true
market
value
has
been
properly
determined.
now
in
this
there
normally
will
not
be
a
serious
dispute
over
the
methodology
provided
that
the
states
have
used
one
of
the
recognized
systems,
there
could
be
in
individual
cases.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
thus
far,
in
the
cases
litigated
to
date,
justice
scalia,
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
none
of
the
cases
has
involved
a
dispute
over
the
allocation
to
the
state.
but
that
certainly
could
arise.
at
this
juncture,
i
would
like
to
turn
my
time
over
to,
yes
justice--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--yes.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
that
is
correct,
justice
white.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
we
think
that
it
was
and
that
we
made
that
showing.
but
fundamentally,
justice
white,
the
basic
issue
in
the
case
is
whether
the
courts
have
jurisdiction
over
discrimination
resulting
from
overvaluation
at
all.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
we
certainly--
ms.
betty
jo
christian
--in
this
case,
justice
white,
the
district
court
received
affidavits
but
did
not
conduct
a
hearing,
and
concluded
on
the
basis
of
those
affidavits
that
burlington
northern
had
not
made
a
strong
showing
of
overvaluation
with
discriminatory
intent.
that
was
upheld
by
the
10th
circuit.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
purposeful
overvaluation
with
discriminatory
intent.
the
district
court
held
that
burlington
northern's
affidavits
did
not
constitute
such
a
showing.
that
was
upheld
by
the
10th
circuit.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
both
courts
upheld
that,
justice
white.
ms.
betty
jo
christian
we
believe
that
intent
is
not
a
relevant
element
at
all,
justice
o'connor.
the
statute
itself
on
its
face,
speaks
in
terms
of
acts
and
results,
and
in
particular
subsection
1(a),
which
we
believe
covers
this
case
does
not
even
use
the
term
discrimination.
it
simply
declares
it
unlawful
for
the
state
to
assess
railroad
property
at
a
percentage
of
fair
market
value
higher
than
that
for
other
property
and
defines
it
in
terms
of
a
mathematical
percentage.
we
believe
there
is
nothing
in
either
the
statute
or
the
legislative
history
to
