justice
o'connor
mrs.
christian,
there
is
certainly
some
indication
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
representatives
of
the
railroad
industry
seeking
this
legislation
did
not
expect
it
to
be
applied
as
you
would
have
us
apply
it
today.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lanier.
justice
o'connor
mrs.
christian
do
you
defend,
or
support,
or
agree
with
the
requirement
of
intentional
discrimination
as
being
an
element.
justice
o'connor
both
those
things
are
likely
to
be
true
of
course,
aren't
they,
mr.
lauber.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
do
you
think
the
statute
would
permit
states
to
impose
a
burden
of
proof
by
clear
and
convincing
evidence
on
the
railroads
in
these
cases?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
doesn't
it
say
that
the
burden
of
proof
will
be
as
determined
by
the
applicable
state
law?
justice
o'connor
on
the
railroads.
justice
o'connor
right.
justice
o'connor
well,
now
why
doesn't
the
statute
provide
exactly
that
in
subsection
2(d):
the
burden
of
proof
with
respect
to
the
determination
of
assessed
value
and
true
market
value
shall
be
that
declared
by
the
applicable
state
law.
justice
o'connor
i
think
i
might
be
inclined
to
give
it
its
ordinary
meaning
and
say
it
would
encompass
the
level
of
the
burden.
justice
o'connor
mr.
lauber,
oh
i'm
sorry,
go
on.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lee,
part
of
the
equation
referred
to
in
subsection
(a)
is
the
ratio
in
relation
to
true
market
value
isn't
it?
justice
o'connor
i
mean,
that's
part
of
the
equation.
justice
o'connor
and
then
when
you
come
down
to
part
2(d)
of
this
section
where
it
deals
with
burden
of
proof,
it
does
refer
to
burden
of
proof
of
true
market
value,
so
apparently
congress
did
envision
some
inquiry
into
true
market
value--
justice
o'connor
--as
part
of
the
assessment
equation.
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
that
it's
open
to
the
federal
court
to
inquire
into
the
true
market
value
of
the
commercial
and
industrial
property
in
the
tax
jurisdiction?
justice
o'connor
so
as
part
of
the
inquiry
into
subsection
(1)(a),
the
court
can
examine
the
true
market
value
by
the
sampling
technique
of
the
commercial
and
industrial
property?
justice
o'connor
but
where
in
the
statute
do
you
see
that
the
court
is
prohibited
from
making
the
same
inquiry
as
to
the
railroad's
true
market
value?
justice
o'connor
well
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
could
at
least
support
the
reading
given
it
by
the
railroad
and
the
solicitor
general,
could
it
not?
justice
o'connor
if
its
overall
object
is
to
prevent
singling
out
the
railroads
unfairly
in
the
ad
valorem
property
tax
structure
of
the
various
jurisdictions
then
it
wouldn't
necessarily
support
you,
would
it?
justice
o'connor
well
if
you
are
right
about
the
interpretation
it
certainly
leaves
it
open
to
the
states
to
recoup
all
the
money
they
otherwise
would
lose
by
jacking
up
the
value
of
the
railroad
property.
justice
o'connor
do
you
support
the
requirement
of
finding
intentional
discrimination
and
if
so
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
statute?
