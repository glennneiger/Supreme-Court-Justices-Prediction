justice
thurgood
marshall
in
this
case
which
comes
to
us
on
certiorari
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit,
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
railroad
revitalization
and
regulatory
reform
act
of
1976
does
not
permit
railroads
to
challenge
in
federal
courts
allegedly
discriminatory
state
taxation
based
upon
overevaluation
of
railroad
property.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
an
opinion
today,
we
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
