mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
when
the
court
last
examined
the
constitution's
veto
provision,
in
the
wright
case,
it
said
that
those
provisions
should
be
interpreted
to
further
two
equal
purposes:
one,
protecting
the
president's
ability
to
veto
messages;
and
two,
protecting
congress'
ability
to
override
vetoes.
the
pocket
veto
that
was
used
in
this
case
damaged
the
framers'
plan
for
allocating
the
lawmaking
responsibility
by
extinguishing
congress'
opportunity
to
override
a
veto,
without
it
being
necessary
for
the
president
to
accomplish
the
veto.
notwithstanding
this
inappropriate
use
of
the
pocket
veto,
the
executives
claim
that
plaintiffs
lack
standing
and
thereby,
that
the
court
is
prohibited
from
granting
relief
in
this
lawsuit.
i'd
like
to
begin
by
addressing
their
standing
point
and
then
move
to
the
merits
and
address
the
mootness
point
as
well.
plaintiffs,
the
houses
and
members
of
congress,
sued
two
executive
officers,
the
acting
archivist
of
the
united
states,
and
the
executive
clerk
of
the
white
house,
because
those
officers
failed
to
perform
duties,
required
by
statute,
to
publish
all
duly
enacted
laws.
the
reasons
for
congress'
existence
is
to
enact
laws.
its
members
seek
office
in
order
to
exercise
the
lawmaking
authority
committed
to
the
congress
by
the
constitution.
by
the
failure
of
the
archivist
and
the
executive
clerk
to
publish
this
statute,
those
officers
nullified
congress'
enactment
of
the
law,
thereby
injuring
the
members
and
the
houses
of
congress
by
depriving
them
of
the
efficacy
of
their
exercise
of
official--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--not
generally
to
enforce
laws
that
congress
has
passed,
but
to
enforce
the
very
particular
statute
that
requires
the
executive
to
record
the
enactment
of
laws.
this
suit
is
not
a
suit
to
enforce
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
bill
that
was
pocketed.
and
we
do
not--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--to
do
that,
yes.
at
least,
we
have
not
asserted
it.
it
has
never
been
a
basis
of
the
standing
in
this
lawsuit.
but
in
distinction,
a
member
of
congress
does
have
standing
to
vindicate
the
effectiveness
of
his
vote
when
his
vote
has
succeeded
in
enacting
a
law.
and
that
is
what
this
court
decided
in
the
coleman
case.
it
found
in
the
coleman
case
that
a
bloc
of
kansas
legislators
had
standing
because
they
had
a
plain,
direct
and
adequate
interest
in
maintaining
the
effectiveness
of
their
votes.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
yes,
they
did.
plain,
direct,
and
adequate
interest
in
maintaining
the
effectiveness
of
their
votes
was
the
language.
and
what
those
plaintiffs
were
seeking
is
very
similar
to
what
we
are
seeking.
they
were
seeking
authentication
and
certification
of
their
action.
they
wanted
erasure
of
a
signature
that
a
constitutional
amendment
had
been
ratified.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
one
of
the
issues...
there
were
several
issues...
one
is
whether
the
lieutenant
governor
should
be
permitted
to
break
the
tie
vote.
and
it
was
a
20-20
vote,
and
he
had
broken
it
in
favor,
and
those
who
were
on
the
losing
end
maintained
that
he
was
not
permitted
to
vote
on
ratification
and
that
therefore
their
votes
had
succeeded
in
defeating
the
amendment.
they
also
had
a
claim
that
because
the
legislature
had
previously
rejected
a
vote,
that
that
rejection
was
binding,
and
that
the
legislature
lacked
power
subsequently
to
enact.
finally,
they
claimed
that
too
long
had...
that
too
long
a
period
of
time
had
passed,
and
that
the
amendment
had
failed.
each
of
these
claims
was
a
claim
that
they
had
succeeded
in
defeating
the
ratification,
and
that
the
actions,
the
ministerial
actions,
of
officers
of
the
government
had
nullified
their
votes;
and
they
should
relief.
and
the
court
found
that
they
had
standing
because
they
had
had
a
concrete
injury
infringed.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
there
had
to
be...
the
court
had
to
have
found
that
there
was
jurisdiction
to
go
on
and
reach
the
justiciability.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
it's
unclear...
there
must
have
been
five
on
the
standing
issue
in
order
to
have
gone
on
and
decided
the
others.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
that's
correct.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
well,
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
those
cases
involved
claims
of
citizens
trying
to
bring
what
the
court
described
as
a
generalized
grievance
to
bring
about
what
their
view
was
required
for
conformity
of
the
law.
but
there
they
had
difficulty
demonstrating
a
concrete
injury
in
fact.
here
there
has
been
a
direct
nullification
of
the
exercise
of--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--but
whether
those
votes
were
successful
in
enacting
a
law
is--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--well,
there
was
not
question
was
the
vote
count
was
in
the
coleman
case.
the
question
was
whether
kansas
had
ratified
or
had
not
ratified.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
that's
right.
but
the
reason
they...
those...
that
bloc
of
the
legislature
had
standing
was
because
their
claim...
if
they
were
right
on
that
claim
on
the
merits,
then
they
had
defeated
the
attempt
to
ratify
the
amendment;
and
therefore,
what
they
were
seeking
was
recordation
of
the
result.
it
was
clear
that
there
were
20
votes.
the
question
was,
had
those
votes
succeeded
in
defeating
ratification
in
that
branch
of
the
kansas
legislature.
and
they
sought
a
recordation
of
that
fact.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
they
were
recorded
in
each
house.
the
bill
was
signed...
certified
as
having
been
approved
by
each
house,
and
was
presented
to
the
president
where...
and
it...
and
the
till
currently
languishes
in
the
office
of
the
president.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
it
was
published,
but
the
bill
hasn't
been
published.
and
maintaining
the
effectiveness
of
that
vote
has
to
mean
recording
the
result
of
that
vote.
and
the
way,
under
statute--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--the
votes
were,
but--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--the
votes
were
recorded.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
it
was
publicly
known.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
but
that's
where
congress--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--it's
been...
it's
been
understood
since
the
very
first
congress,
and
the
statute
they
passed
in
1789,
that
the
completion
of
the
lawmaking
process
includes
the
requirement
that
the
executive
branch
record
laws
that
have
been
enacted.
and
that
certification
requirement
is
now
carried
forward
by
the
statute
that
the
executive
preserve
and
publish
statutes.
and
it's
that...
it
is
only
that
act
that
will
given
congress
the
effectiveness
of
their
votes
which
succeeded
in
enacting
the
statute.
the
court
found
as
early
as
marbury
v.
madison
that
marbury
had
standing
to
seek
the
performance
of
a
ministerial
duty,
the
delivery
of
a
commission,
necessary
to
give
him
the
right
to
exercise
official
power,
in
that
case
as
an
appointed
officer
of
the
government,
that
he
claimed
he
had
the
right
to.
it
was
a
constitutional
claim
that
he
had
been
appointed,
and
he
sought
the
performance
of
the
ministerial
act
that
would
vindicate
his
right.
and
the
court
found
that
the
delivery
of
the
commission
would
vindicate
that
right.
similarly,
the
court
has
held
in
a
number
of
other
cases
that
institutions
of
government
or
officers
of
government
have
standing
to
adjudicate
infringements
of
their
official
power.
and
it's
found
that
in
cases
brought
by
state
governments
against
the
federal
government;
in
cases
brought
by
one
entity
of
the
federal
government.
the
executive's
attempt
is
a
novel
attempt
to
write
an
absolute
rule
that
bars
all
infringements
to
official
power,
and
render
all
of
those
automatically
noncognizable
under
the
separation
of
powers.
but
the
cases
that
the
court...
the
cases
in
which
the
court
has
adjudicated
infringements
demonstrate
that
there
can
be
no
such
per
se
rule.
the
reason
why
the
standing
argument
implicates
the
separation
of
powers
is
because
the
separation
of
powers
maintains
the
limited
the
role
of
the
courts,
reserving
to
the
political
branches
those
disputes
that
are
appropriately
addressed
by
elected
officials...
political
matters.
this
adjudication,
however,
will
enhance,
not
impair,
the
democratic
system.
therefore,
respect
for
the
separation
of
powers
not
only
permits,
but
compels,
this
adjudication.
this
suit
seeks
to
resolve
what
justice
powell
called,
in
goldwater
v.
carter,
a
constitutional
impasse
between
the
branches.
both
houses
of
congress
have
voted
to
enact
the
law
and
presented
it
to
the
president
for
approval
or
veto.
by
these
actions
congress
completed
the
steps
available
for
the
enactment
of
legislation.
the
executive
announced
that
it
was
exercising
a
pocket
veto.
then
the
senate
adopted
a
resolution
asserting
its
view
that
this
bill
had
became
law,
and
directing
intervention
in
this
lawsuit
to
press
that
view.
as
the
court
of
appeals
found,
there
could
be
no
clearer
instance
of
a
constitutional
impasse
between
the
executive
and
the
legislative
branches
than
is
presented
by
this
case.
the
fact
that
this
controversy
resulted
from
congress'
enactment
of
a
law
distinguishes
it
from
other
kinds
of
disputes
that
are
appropriately
resolved
by
political
processes.
first,
it
demonstrates
that
all
of
congress,
not
just
a
part
of
congress,
was
injured.
it
demonstrates
further
that
the
injury
is
entirely
at
the
hands
of
another
branch;
in
this
case,
the
executive.
thus,
this
kind
of
controversy
is
sharply
distinguished
for
an
intramural
dispute
where
one
element
of
congress
is
seeking
relief
that
could
be
provided
by
all
of
congress
if
congress
shared
the
plaintiffs'
view.
second,
we
know
here
that
a
confrontation
has
occurred.
this
does
not
present
a
case
of
an
incipient
controversy,
so--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--yes,
congress
publishes...
the
executive
publishes
by
statute
all
laws
that
have
become
law,
and
that
includes...
if
it's
a
two-day
continuing
resolution
to
keep
the
government
funded
for
the
first
couple
of
days
of
the
fiscal
year,
that's
expired
before
it's
ever
published,
but
it's
published.
all
laws--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--the
basis
for
our
standing
was
only
the
infringement
to
our
vote.
it
wasn't
an
attempt
to
enforce
the
law.
we
didn't...
congress
did
not
sue
executive
officials
who
had
substantive
duties
under
this
law.
therefore
the
very
injury
that
underlies
the
standing...
basis
for
our
standing,
which
is
the
nullification
of
the
votes
that
results
from
the
failure
to
publish,
continues
to
exist.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
that's
right.
but
that
is
a
law--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--there
is
a
question.
but
that's
a
very
different
and
a
much
more
narrow
question.
that's
a
question
of
whether
congress
has
standing
to
get
the
executive
branch
to
comply
with
the
single
law,
or
a
couple
of
provisions,
that
enforce
their
votes.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
well,
that
would
be
a...
that
would
be
a
more
difficult
case.
it
would
not--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--well,
there
might
be
other
barriers.
the
statute
that
requires
publication
also
say,
the
statutes
at
large
shall
be
legal
evidence
of
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
shouldn't
be.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
but
it
might
be
that
there's
a
point
at
which
it's
gone
too
far.
but
that
hasn't...
that
isn't
the
case
where
the
executive,
in
a
difference
with
congress
over
a
constitutional
power,
has
nullified
the
congress'
enactment
authority.
that's
the
kind
of
correction...
congress
makes
mistake
in
rolling
bills
and
presenting
them.
and
those
aren't
solved
by
congress...
someone
suing
another
part
of
the
congress.
those
are
dealt
with
in
clerical
ways
if
they
can,
and
by
technical
corrections,
if
necessary.
but
here,
the
decision
not
to
publish
this
law
was
a
deliberate
decision
by
the
executive
branch
not
to
recognize
that
this
bill
became
a
law.
and
that
nullified...
that
act
nullified
congress'
votes
in
favor
of
the
law.
in
addition,
we
pointed
out,
in
our
brief,
that
there
are
accounting
consequences
in
the
government
as
to
whether
this
bill
is
a
law
or
not,
and
that
those
transcend
the
particular
fiscal
year.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
well,
we
haven't
asserted
it.
it
does...
it
is
true
that
one
of
there
statutes
requires
whenever
there's
been
a
violation
of
a
spending
restriction,
requires
the
executive
to
report
to
the
congress
on
what
steps
it
has
taken.
it's--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--that's
right.
and
all...
we
only
point
to
those
consequences,
not
because
they
give
us
an
independent
basis
for
standing,
but
because
that
demonstrates
that
the
mootness
claim
that's
been
raised
is
really
identical
to
the
standing
claim.
because
those
show
that
there
are
consequences
to
the
law
after
the
end
of
the
fiscal
year
as
there
were
during.
it
doesn't
change
the
fact
that
our
lawsuit
is
not
a
suit
to
obtain
substantive
relief
under
the
provisions,
and
we've
not
claimed
standing
to
do
so.
instead,
it
is
merely
the
requirement
by
statute,
from
the
first
days,
that
the
executive
branch
recognize
and
certify
congress'
enactments.
and
then,
whatever
processes
there
are,
will
take
over.
in
this
case,
they
will
lead
to
some
further
actions
in
a
report
to
congress.
but
our
basis
for
standing
is
identical
now
to
what
it
was
the
day
the
lawsuit
was
filed.
and
it's
very
similar
to
the
basis
in
coleman
and
in
marbury
and
in
every
other
time
that
there
has
been
a
lawsuit
for
the
performance
of
a
duty
that's
owed
to
a
governmental
entity
in
order
to
vindicate
its
exercise
of
power.
i'd
like
to
turn
now
to
the
merits.
the
invalidity
of
this
pocket
veto
is
clear
from
the
plain
text
of
the
constitution,
the
intent
of
the
framers,
and
the
practical
significance
of
the
clause's
application.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
congress
could
do
something
like
that.
presumably,
the
executive's
argument
relying
on
the
dictum
in
the
pocket
veto
case
is
that
congress
must
be
in
session,
and
that
the
president's
clerk
must
have
the
opportunity
of
delivering
the
bill
to
the
house
in
full
session.
so
what
that
kind
of
rule
would
require
is
not
that
congress
would
call
its
adjournment
by
a
different
name,
but
that
it
change
its
schedule
and
remain
in
session
for
a
period
of
10
days
or
more,
because
it
takes
awhile
for
bills
to
be
presented
to
the
president,
in
order
to
ensure
that
the
president
will
return
a
bill
to
it.
and
the
constitution
simply
does
not
require
the
congress
to
take
various
strategic
and
evasive
actions
in
order
to
implement
the
plan
that
was
the
purpose
behind
these
provisions.
the
constitution
provides
language
adequate
to
face
the
need
of
the
president,
to
be
able
to
ensure
that
he
can
veto
a
bill;
and
the
right
of
congress,
as
long
as
they've
given
that
opportunity,
to
determine
whether
to
override
by
two-thirds
vote.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
as
long
as
it's--
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
--we
only
go
as
far
as
the
procedures,
the
constitutional
procedures,
which
establish
the
lawmaking
process.
and
that's
what
the
court
reached
in
chadha,
and
found
that
it's
the
court's
proper
role
to
determine
and
settle,
interpret,
the
procedures
governing
the
lawmaking
process,
and
to
settle
controversies
between
the
branches
over
those.
and
as
the
executive
has
acknowledged,
the
substance
of
this
lawsuit
is
not
a
political
question.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
we
believe
as
the
courts
recognize
that
establishing
the
groundrules
for
the
use
of
the
pocket
veto
is
the
proper
role
of
the
court
where
there
is
a
concrete
case
of
injury,
as
there
is
here.
and
is
is
a
very
narrow
holding.
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
that
don't
agree
that
there's
injury
here?
mr.
morgan
j.
frankel
i
don't
believe
so.
the
executive
disputes
that
fact.
but
i
believe
the
court
cases
and
the
separation
of
powers
values
underlying
demonstrate
that
there
is
cognizable
injury
in
an
infringement
such
as
this.
turning
then
to
the
merits,
the
constitution
says,
article
i,
section
7,
clause
2,
that
"if
any
bill
shall
not
be
return
by
the
president
within
ten
days.
"
then
the
bill
shall
be
a
law
in
the
same
manner
as
if
he
had
signed
it,
"unless
the
congress
by
their
adjournment
prevent
its
return,
in
which
case
it
shall
not
be
a
law.
"
the
only
thing
stopping
a
bill
from
becoming
a
law,
according
to
the
text,
is
if,
by
adjourning,
congress
prevents
the
bill's
return.
and
then
the
president
can
pocket
it.
the
plain
words
of
the
clause
shoe
that
this
bill
became
a
law
because
the
president
could
have
returned
the
bill
to
the
originating
house
and
he
didn't.
the
fact
that
congress
was
in
an
adjournment
at
the
time
is
irrelevant
is
long
as
the
adjournment
is
not
on
that
prevents
return
of
the
bill.
this
textual
reading
of
the
clause
is
confirmed
by
an
examination
of
the
purpose
of
the
pocket
veto
provision
in
the
constitution.
the
pocket
veto
implements
the
framers
fundamental
decision
about
the
placement
of
legislative
responsibility;
and
that
was
the
determination
to
give
the
president
only
the
qualified
power
to
arrest
the
enactment
of
laws
by
returning
them
to
congress.
the
framers
determined
that
the
president
would
have
the
power
to
return
unacceptable
bills,
but
that
congress
must
have
the
power
to
override
the
president's
objections
if
two-thirds
of
its
members
were
not
persuaded
by
them.
the
pocket
veto
was
adopted
solely
to
guarantee
adherence
to
this
distribution
of
the
lawmaking
power,
by
ensuring
that
congress
could
not
provide
the
president
of
the
opportunity
to
exercise
a
veto.
if
congress
were
to
adjourn
out
from
under
the
president,
depriving
him
of
the
chance
of
vetoing,
he
could
simply
pocket
the
bill.
thus
the
pocket
veto
was
intended
as
a
defensive
mechanism
solely
to
guarantee
that
the
president
would
retain
the
ability
to
effect
the
veto.
the
attempt
to
pocket
veto
this
bill
during
an
interim
adjournment
of
the
congress
failed
to
respect
the
purpose
of
the
provision
and
the
plan
of
the
framers.
during
this
adjournment,
each
house
had
assigned
to
an
officer
the
duty
to
accept
veto
messages
from
the
president.
the
purpose
of
doing
that
was
precisely
to
assure
that
by
adjourning
congress
would
not
prevent
the
president
from
returning
a
till.
thus,
the
decision
to
pocket
this
bill
was
a
decision
to
use
a
pocket
veto
in
lieu
of
a
constitutionally
available
alternative
of
a
return
veto.
by
so
doing,
the
congress
was
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
repass
the
bill,
while
the
executive
in
no
way
needed
to
use
the
pocket
veto
to
maintain
its
ability
to
veto
the
bill.
the
executive
argues,
in
defense
of
this
use
of
the
pocket
veto,
that
the
constitution
bars
congress
from
using
officers
to
receive
vetoes
whenever
it
is
adjourned
for
longer
than
three
days.
they
call
three
days
the
constitutionally
prescribed
dividing
line,
identifying
those
adjournments
that
prevent
return.
but
the
constitution
does
not
say
that
a
bill
becomes
law
unless
congress
has
adjourned,
or
unless
congress
has
adjourned
for
more
than
three
days.
the
framers
could
have
adopted
either
of
those
formulations.
but
instead,
they
provided
that
a
bill
that
the
president
has
not
acted
upon
becomes
law
unless
the
congress,
by
their
adjournment,
prevent
the
bill's
return.
with
this
language,
the
framers
understood
that
some
adjournments
would
prevent
return,
and
that
others
would
not.
and
they
declined
to
set
up
rigid
categories
to
attempt
to
control
in
advance
which
adjournments
would
be
deemed
to
prevent
return.
instead
of
such
a
fixed
rule,
like
the
one
that
the
executive
argues
for
here,
the
framers
wrote
into
the
constitution
a
conditional
rule,
using
the
word
"prevent",
so
that
their
rule
could
adapt
as
congress'
practices
developed.
this
understanding
is
consistent
with
the
court's
decision
in
the
pocket
veto
case.
in
that
case,
the
court
decided
that
an
adjournment
during
the
69th
congress
did
prevent
the
president
from
returning
a
bill
because,
at
the
time,
there
was
no
practice
of
congress
appointing
officers;
no
practice
of
accepting
bills
from
the
president,
vetoed
bills
from
the
president,
during
an
adjournment.
but
practices
since
then
have
changed.
the
congress
now
meets
much
longer
during
the
year;
takes
a
number
of
short
breaks
throughout
its
meetings.
in
keeping
with
this
contemporary
development,
the
congress
now
arranges
for
the
receipt
of
messages
from
the
president
while
it
is
not
sitting.
the
executive
relies
on
dictum
in
the
pocket
veto
case
that
said
that
constitution
was
not
permitted...
does
not
permit
congress
to
use
agents
to
accept
veto
messages.
but
the
executive
ignores
that
several
years
later,
in
the
wright
case,
this
court
expressly
disapproved
that
language,
and
said
that
the
constitution
does
not
define
what
shall
constitute
a
return
of
a
bill,
or
deny
the
use
of
appropriate
agencies
in
effecting
the
return.
the
court
noted
in
wright
that
both
the
congress
and
the
president
use
agents
to
perform
their
duties
in
the
lawmaking
process.
the
congress
does
not
troop
down
to
the
white
house
en
masse
to
present
bills
to
the
president.
it
uses
an
agent
to
do
that.
the
president,
for
his
part,
does
not
accept
bills
personally,
even
though
the
constitution
says
bills
must
be
presented
to
the
president.
rather,
the
executive
clerk
of
the
white
house
accepts
bills
on
the
president's
behalf.
on
the
bill's
return
trip
up
capitol
hill
as
well,
the
text
of
the
constitution,
he,
the
president,
shall
return
bills.
but
the
president
doesn't
return
bills
personally.
he
gives
them
to
his
executive
clerk,
and
the
clerk
delivers
them
to
the
congress.
there's
no
reason
in
the
constitution
why
the
clerk
of
the
president
should
be
barred
constitutionally
from
delivering
vetoed
bills
to
the
clerk
of
the
house
of
representatives.
the
court
of
appeals
properly
performed
its
task
of
integrating
this
court's
decisions
in
the
pocket
veto
case
and
in
wright,
and
in
determining
that
during
this
adjournment,
there
was
no
problem
with
the
president
using
the
available
means
to
return
a
bill
to
the
congress.
as
judge
mcgowan
wrote
for
the
court,
there
was
no
problem
that
there
would
be
uncertainty
if
the
president
were
to
use
this
vehicle
as
to
whether
or
not
he
had
vetoed
a
bill;
and
there
was
no
problem
of
undue
delay
before
congress
could
have
determined
whether
it
wished
to
override
the
veto.
the
executive
maintains
that
this
adjournment
was...
prevented
return
of
a
bill
because
congress
couldn't
consider
the
president's
objections
and
whether
to
override
until
after
it
returned
several
weeks
later.
but
the
constitution
does
not
say
that
congress
must
immediately
reconsider
a
bill.
it
says
it
shall
proceed
to
reconsider.
as
the
court
of
appeals
noted,
the
constitution
sets
no
time
limit
on
congress'
exercise
of
its
power
to
override
a
return
veto.
there
is
no
basis
in
the
constitution
for
the
executive's
attempt
to
elevate
the
value
of
rapid
return
and
reconsideration
in
override
of
a
bill
over
the
fundamental
goal
of
the
constitution
to
ensure
that
congress
would
have
an
opportunity
to
override
by
a
vote
of
two-thirds
on
its
own
schedule,
if
it
wished
to
do
so.
the
executive
position
would
argue
for
a
vast
reallocation
of
the
lawmaking
power.
by
setting
the
rule
at
three
days,
the
executive
maintains
that
every
adjournment
of
four
or
five
days,
for
example,
for
a
long
holiday
weekend,
precludes
the
congress
constitutionally
from
accepting
return
of
a
bill,
and
accordingly,
prohibits
use
of
a
return
veto
with
the
possibility
of
an
override.
the
executive
makes
this
argument
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
in
recent
years,
presidents,
including
president
reagan,
have
returned
a
number
of
bills
to
congress
during
adjournments
by
delivering
to
agents.
president
reagan
has
returned
more
than
one-third
of
his
bills
in
precisely
that
fashion.
the
executive's
argument
would
require
the
finding
that
the
constitution
in
fact
required
that
all
of
those
bills
be
pocketed
instead,
and
that
congress
be
deprived
of
the
opportunity
to
override
vetoes
by
a
two-thirds
vote
whenever
it
has
adjourned
for
more
than
three
days.
the
executive
is
essentially
taking
the
constitutional
framework
intended
to
distribute
power
between
the
branches
and
reading
it
as
a
technical
manual
of
administrative
procedures.
in
the
course
of
that,
the
executive
is
perfectly
willing
to
sacrifice
the
plan
of
mutual
checks
that
is...
was
the
dominant
purpose
behind
these
provisions
of
the
constitution.
thank
you,
mr.
frankel.
do
you
have
something
more,
mr.
willard?
you
have
ten
minutes
left.
