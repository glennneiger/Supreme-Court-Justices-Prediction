chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
burke
against
barnes.
mr.
willard,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yet
in
our
doremus
case
in
the
early
fifties
we
said,
apparently
contrary
to
your
view
of
coleman
v.
miller,
that
the
same
standards
govern
adjudication
of
federal
questions
raised
in
state
courts
as
govern
federal
questions
adjudicated
in
federal
courts.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
would
think
it
would.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
willard.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
frankle.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
they
didn't...
did
they
say
that
in
so
many
words?
did
the
coleman
majority
use
the
language
that
you're
just
referred
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
was
a
dispute
over
the
actual
counting
of
the
votes,
wasn't
there,
in
the
kansas
legislature?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
wonder
how
consistent
that
ruling
is
with
later
cases
from
this
court,
like
schlesinger
v.
reservists
and
united
states
v.
richardson?
it
seemed
to
me
in
those
cases
a
narrower
view
was
taken
of
an
official
right
to
bring
an
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
wonder
if
there
has.
there's
no
question
that
these
people's
votes
were
counted
at
the
the
time
the
senate
voted
on
the
thing.
i
mean,
you
see
a
nullification
of
the
vote.
it
certainly...
there
was
no
dispute
as
to
how
the
vote
was
counted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
that's
not
the
same
thing,
i
don't
think.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
one
of
the
questions
was
whether
the
lieutenant
governor
could
break
a
tie,
which
was
a
question
about
the
vote
count.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
hasn't
the
controversy
somewhat
been
dispelled
by
the
fact
that
the
law
expired?
so
i
mean,
do
you
ordinarily
publish
laws
that
have
expired
by
their
terms?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
what
do
members
of
congress
gain
in
the
sense
that
would
give
them
standing
by
having
a
law
that
is
expired
published?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
willard.
the
case
is
submitted.
