mr.
willard,
if
we
grant
you
relief,
how
do
we
explain
that
we
are
not
legislating?
you
know,
we're
always
accused
of
that.
and
aren't
you
asking
us
to
do
just
that?
justice
marshall
you
don't
want
us
to
reach
the
merits?

justice
marshall
and
that's
all
you
want
decided?
justice
marshall
in
this
case,
were
these
votes
recorded
in
the
congressional
record?
justice
marshall
but
you
say
it
didn't
have
their
votes,
that
their
complaint
was
that
it
wasn't
fair
to
their
vote.
the
vote
was
published.
justice
marshall
well,
wasn't
it
recorded
in
the
congressional
record?
justice
marshall
you
use
the
word,
record.
wasn't
it
recorded
in
the
congressional
record?
justice
marshall
wasn't
it
also
recorded
in
the
new
york
times--
justice
marshall
--and
all
around
the
world.
but
it
wasn't
in
this
one
particular--
justice
marshall
--and
that
wrecks
everybody.
justice
marshall
xxx
run
into
political?
justice
marshall
i'm
just
wondering.
the
further
you
go,
i
mean--
justice
marshall
--but
when
you
take
a
case
that
there
are
people
who
consider
to
be
absolutely
moot,
and
inject
life
into
it,
don't
you
get
over
into
the
political
side?
justice
marshall
well,
aren't
there
quite
a
few
who
don't
agree
that
there's
injury?
justice
marshall
yes.
