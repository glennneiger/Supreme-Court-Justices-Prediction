justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
you
on
that,
what
about
the
argument
they
make
about
some
auditing
consequences
about
whether
compliance
with
the
bill
would
have
had
fiscal
consequences?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
your
argument...
and
you
may
be
right,
of
course...
that
your
argument
on
mootness
really
merges
with
your
argument
on
standing,
and
that
if
you're
right
on
mootness,
it's
because
you're
right
on
standing.
justice
stevens
and
then...
and
what
is
your
distinction
with
coleman
v.
miller?
is
that
because
the
state
legislature,
or--
justice
stevens
--they're
not
standing
questions?
justice
stevens
just
let
me
get
this
thought
up,
then
i
want
you
to
complete
your
answer.
but
directing
you
just
to
the
question
of
whether
there's
injury
in
fact
as
a
result
of
the
nullification
of
the
vote,
which
is
sort
of
the
threshold
on...
the
case
in
controversy
standing.
wasn't
there
injury
in
fact
as
to
the
20
legislators
in
the
kansas
legislature
who
voted
in
favor
of
ratification?
justice
stevens
well,
let's
confine
ourselves
to
the
five,
counting
chief
justice
hughes.
justice
stevens
but
you're
not
suggesting
the
state
court
can
create
injury
in
fact?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
frankel,
they
did
sue
to
enforce
the
publishing
law.
justice
stevens
isn't
there
a
question
whether
they
have
standing
to
do
that?
justice
stevens
supposing
there
was
a
misprint
in
the
statutes
at
large,
and
there
are
sometimes,
could
congress
sue
the
president
and
say,
i
want
you
reprint
the
volume?
justice
stevens
why?
isn't
that
precisely
what
this
case
is?
as
far
as,
you
have
to
have
an
argument
about
whether
it's
really
a
misprint,
that's
what
they
intended
or
not.
justice
stevens
that
strengthens
my
case.
we
shouldn't
have
misprints
as
legal
evidence.
justice
stevens
no.
justice
stevens
well,
but
again,
respond
to
your
opponent's
argument
on
that:
does
congress
have
standing
to
enforce
these
accounting
requirements?
justice
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
this
record
does
not
tell
us
whether
there
has
even
been
a
violation
of
the
terms
of
the
bill,
whether
it
was
a
law
or
not?
justice
stevens
mr.
frankel,
can
i
just
give
you
one
question
before
you
get
into
the
argument?
your
opponent
suggests
that
you
have
the
solution
to
this
problem
within
your
own
hands.
couldn't
you
do
something
like
what
this
court
did
a
few
years
ago,
just
not
be
adjourned
during
the
summer
months,
but
stay
in
session
continuously.
so
that
during
your...
between
two
sessions,
instead
of
adjourning,
as
you
do
know,
just
put
a
different
name
it;
call
it
a
recess
or
a
vacation
or
something...
you
know,
a
campaign
period
or
something...
and
then
have
the
effective
date
of
adjournment
be
15
days
after
they
cease
their
active
work.
so
that
literally
you
wouldn't
have
an
adjournment
for
that
15-day
period,
and
then
the
president
could
never
exercise
a
pocket
veto.
