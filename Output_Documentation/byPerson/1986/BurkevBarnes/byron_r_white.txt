justice

you
think...
then
the...
what
controls
when
a
bill
is
printed
up
as
a
public
act?
justice
white
and
so
i
take
it
that
congress
couldn't
ever
insist
that
their
public
laws
be...
that
the
public
laws
be
printed?
justice
white
by
a
suit?
justice
white
you
say,
no,
the
executive
would
just
say,
i
know
i'm
supposed
to
get
these
public
acts
printed
up,
but
it
costs
too
much
money.
justice
white
well,
what
about
a
joint
resolution
by
congress
saying,
we
want
to
sue?
justice
white
so
it
just
isn't
an
individual
congressman
or
a
senator
or
one
house.
it's
just
that
congress
itself,
by
a
joint
resolution,
couldn't
authorize
a
suit?
justice
white
that
may
be
so.
but
the
question
is
whether
they
have
standing
to
insist
that
public
laws
be
printed.
justice
white
so
we
just
leave
these
cases
to
political
settlement?
justice
white
yes,
but
congress
can't
do
anything
about
it?
justice
white
but
not
much
stronger?
justice
white
was
held.
whether
they
held
that
or
not,
they
said
that
in
this
case,
there
was
a
case
for
controversy.
justice
white
well,
why
would
it...
why
would
it
be
a
jurisdictional
question?
why
shouldn't
it
just
be
a...
why
shouldn't
a
cause
of...
a
motion
to
dismiss
just
be
sustained
for
failure
to
state
a
cause
of
action?
justice
white
but
why
is
it
a
jurisdictional
question
at
all?
i
mean,
why...
i
would
suppose...
you
say
you
cannot
make
the
executive
enforce
the
laws,
congress
can't?
justice
white
well--
justice
white
--but
all
you're
saying
is
that
you
really...
there
is
just
not
cause
of
action.
it's
a
separation
of
powers
matter?
justice
white
but
is
that
a
jurisdictional
question?
justice
white
you
say
it
is.
but
i
don't
know
why
it
isn't
just
a
cause
of
action
issue.
you
win
anyway,
but--
