mr.
richard
k.
willard
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
this
court
recognized
in
its
unanimous
opinion
the
pocket
veto
case,
the
term
"pocket
veto"
is
something
is
a
misnomer
because
it
implies
an
affirmative
act
on
the
part
of
the
president.
in
fact,
the
pocket
veto
arises
from
presidential
inaction.
if
the
president
neither
signs
a
bill
nor
returns
it
to
congress
with
his
objections
within
10
days,
sundays
excepted,
followed
presentment,
the
last
sentence
of
article
i,
section
7,
clause
2,
spells
out
what
happens.
it
says,
"the
same
shall
be
a
law,
in
like
manner
as
if
he
had
signed
it,
unless
the
congress
by
their
adjournment
prevent
its
return,
in
which
case
it
shall
not
be
a
law.
"
on
november
18,
1983,
congress
did
two
things.
it
presented
h.
r.
4042,
an
enrolled
bill,
to
the
president.
and
it
adjourned
its
first
session
sine
die.
h.r.
4042
was
met
with
presidential
inaction.
the
president
neither
signed
it
nor
returned
it
to
congress
with
his
objections.
this
suit
was
brought
by
the
congressional
respondents
to
obtain
a
declaratory
judgment
that
by
operation
of
article
i,
section
7,
clause
2,
h.r.
4042
became
a
law
just
as
if
the
president
had
signed
it.
now,
it's
important
to
recognize
at
the
very
outset
that
h.r.
4042
would
have
expired
by
its
own
terms
on
september
30th,
1984,
one
month
after
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
was
entered
in
this
case,
and
more
than
six
months
before
their
opinions
were
filed.
the
question
of
mootness
ties
in
to
the
question
of
whether
the
congressional
respondents
have
standing
on
any
theory
to
maintain
this
suit
for
declaratory
relief.
i
should
point
out,
however,
that
we
have
no
doubt
of
the
power
of
the
courts
to
decide
the
meaning
of
the
pocket
veto
clause
in
a
real
case
or
controversy.
a
person
with
legal
rights
under
h.r.
4042
could
sue
to
enforce
those
rights,
and
in
the
process,
obtain
a
judicial
determination
as
to
whether
or
not
4042
is
or
is
not
a
law.
such
were
the
claims
of
the
plaintiff
indian
tribes
in
the
pocket
veto
case,
or
the
individual
claimant
in
wright
v.
united
states.
here,
however,
we
have
a
completely
different
basis
for
standing
asserted
by
the
congressional
respondents.
they
claim
no
substantive
rights
under
h.r.
4042.
instead,
their
claim
is
that
the
failure
of
the
executive
branch
to
regard
h.r.
4042
as
a
law
has
nullified
their
votes,
thus
creating
judicially
cognizable
injury.
now
there
are
two
different
ways
that
this
injury
of
nullification
has
been
explained.
the
original
theory
of
the
case
was
that
the
president
nullified
the
votes
of
the
congressional
respondents
when
he
failed
to
carry
out
the
substantive
revisions
of
h.r.
4042,
when
he
provided
military
aid
to
el
salvador
without
filing
the
requisite
certifications
about
progress
on
human
rights.
now
it's
certainly
clear
that
that
theory
of
standing
is
completely
moot,
because
h.r.
4042
has
expired,
and
the
law
governing
military
aid
to
el
salvador
is
completely
different,
and
is
not
affected
by
whether
or
not
h.r.
4042
did
or
did
not
become
a
law.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
justice
stevens,
it's
our
view
that
these
collateral
consequences,
or
asserted
collateral
consequences,
do
not
involve
the
parties
before
the
court
in
this
case,
and
thus,
do
not
provide
a
basis
for
avoiding
mootness;
that
the
dispute
would
involve
the
secretary
of
state,
allegedly,
or
the
controller
general,
neither
of
whom
are
parties
here.
and
there's
no
indication
that
the
congressional
respondents
would
be
proper
parties
in
that
kind
of
a
case.
in
any
event,
that
kind
of
a
collateral
lawsuit,
which
we
don't
think
is
a
basis
for
the...
for
a
case
here,
would
be
one
in
which
congress
would
not
have
standing
as
well,
because
it
would
be
a
dispute
over
execution
of
the
law.
that's
the
problem,
of
course,
with
their
broad
theory
as
well.
that
is,
they
assert
that
members
of
congress
have
a
judicially
cognizable
interest
in
whether
or
not
laws
are
faithfully
executed
after
they
pass
them.
and--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--i
think
there
is
much
truth
to
that,
justice
stevens.
and
that's
why
in
our
reply
brief
we
merge
the
two
arguments
together
to
talk
about
them.
i
think
there
is
an
aspect
in
which
they
interrelate.
but
setting
aside
the
mootness
issue,
even
if
h.r.
4042
did
not
have
a
sunset
provision
and
were
still
ongoing,
their
broad
theory
of
standing,
that
members
of
congress
can
sue
because
laws
are
not
being
executed
and
thus,
their
votes
are
being
nullified,
is
one
which
would
be
quite
novel
for
this
court
to
recognize,
and,
we
think,
inconsistent
with
the
courts
teaching
in
chadha
and
synar.
and
that
is,
that
congress
has
an
interest
in
the
lawmaking
process
that
ends
once
laws
are
made,
and
that
they
do
not
have
an
ongoing
power
to
supervise
the
execution
of
the
laws
through
some
kind
of
extraconstitutional--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that's
one
of
four
distinctions,
justice
stevens.
it
did
involve
state
legislatures,
and
that
of
course
doesn't
raise
the
same
kind
of
separation
of
powers
questions
as
we
have
when
we
have
congress,
the
u.s.
courts,
and
the
president
involved.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
in
addition
there's
the
different
kind
of
standing
involved
there.
the
legislators
were
dealing
with
an
issue
of
whether
their
votes
were
being
counted
properly
within
the
legislative
process.
this
case
involves
something
different.
and
that
is,
once
the
legislative
process
has
come
to
an
end,
once
they've
passed
a
bill,
whether
or
not
the
bill
is
being
correct
effect.
i
think
the
distinction
that
the
court
drew
in
the
bender
case,
in
footnote
6,
i
believe
it
was...
footnote
7...
distinguishing
coleman
in
that
case
is
apt
here
as
well.
and
that
is
that
in
bender
you
had
a
situation
where
an
individual
board
member
was
trying
to
pursue
a
cause
of
action.
but
it
wasn't
about
whether
or
not
his
vote
had
been
counted
by
the
board.
it
was
whether
or
not
the
board's
action
should
be
given
validity.
and
that's
the
same
kind
of
situation
we
have
here.
it's
not
like
powell
v.
mccormack,
where
someone
is
claiming
a
right
to
sit
in
congress.
it's
where
the
congressional
respondents
are
claiming
some
power
once
they
passed
a
bill
to
have
the
executive
act
in
some
way
with
regard
to
it.
and
that,
we
think,
in
addition
distinguishes
coleman.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
this
is
a
statutory
matter,
justice
white.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
presumably--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--by
a
suit.
that's
our
position.
that's
the
narrower
theory.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
presumably
if
congress
wanted
to
hire
its
own
printer,
that
would
be
another
matter.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
it's
our
position
that
would
not
be
effective
in
creating
standing.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
in
this
kind
of
a
situation,
over
execution
of
the
laws.
now,
the
business
about
printing
of
the
laws
is
of
course
the
narrower
theory
of
standing
that
the
respondents
seem
to
be
relying
on
mostly
here.
it's
our
position
that
whether
or
not
a
law
is
printed
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
or
not
it's
a
law.
in,
for
example,
the
pocket
veto
case,
and
in
the
wright
case,
the
court
did
not
treat
publication
as
dispositive.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
understand,
justice
white.
but
that's
not
the
same
as
standing...
that's
not
a
nullification
of
their
vote
on
h.r.
4042.
4042
can
take
effect.
someone
who
has
legal
rights
under
it
can
sue
to
protect
those
legal
rights,
whether
or
not
it's
printed.
and
so
the
failure
to
print
a
law
does
not
nullify
the
vote
on
whether
or
not
it
became
a
law.
that's
a...
it's
a
separate--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--no,
justice
white,
not
at
all.
if
a
party
has
a
legal
right,
if
a
party's
adversely
affected
one
way
or
another
by
a
bill
that
is
asserted
to
have
become
a
law,
they
can
sue
as
in
the
pocket
veto
case
and
get
a
judicial
determination.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
not
by
filing
a
lawsuit,
justice
white.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
there
certainly
could
be,
justice
o'connor.
and
we
have
always
recognized
that
there
is
a
stronger
case
for
standing
on
the
part
of
congress
as
an
institution
than
individual
members
who
are
off
on
their
own
agenda.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
but
we
have
decided
it's
still
not
strong
enough.
our
position
is
that
congress
as
an
institution
cannot--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
as
i
indicated
to
justice
stevens,
i
think
coleman
dealt
with
a
different
kind
of
question,
one
that
involved
a
state
rather
than
the
federal
congress,
and
that
the
separation
of
powers
are
different.
for
example,
in
the--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
it's
unclear,
justice
stevens.
the
court,
in
coleman,
was
closely
divided
on
the
standing
issue.
justice
frankfurter,
black,
douglas
and
roberts
dissented.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
and
what
they
said
in
coleman
was,
they
said
that
state
senators
have
an
interest
in
the
controversy
which,
treated
by
the
state
court,
is
a
basis
for
entertaining
and
deciding
the
federal
questions,
is
sufficient
to
give
this
court
jurisdiction
to
review
that
decision.
they
did
not
say--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--that
is
what
the
coleman
majority
suggested.
and--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--sufficient.
they
did
not
hold
that
there
would
have
been
a
sufficient
injury
in
fact
for
these
individuals
to
have
sued
in
federal
court.
and
in
fact
justice
frankfurter
in
his
dissenting
opinion...
or
his
concurring
opinion...
said
that
clearly
they
would
not
have
had
standing
to
sue
in
federal
court.
so
there
is
a
question,
i
think,
as
to
whether
or
not
there
would
be
sufficient
injury
in
fact
in
the
coleman
situation.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
i
understand,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
that
may
case
some
doubt
on
the
coleman
decision
itself--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--as
to
whether
it's
correct
or
not
in
this
case.
but
i
think
that
whether
or
not
coleman
is
correct,
that
it's
also
distinguishable
by
the
difference
between
the
federal
relationship
and
the
federal-state
relationship.
in
cillock,
for
example,
this
court
said
that
state
legislators
did
not
have
a
speech
or
debate
clause
immunity
the
way
federal
legislators
do.
so
they
could
be
prosecuted
for
legislative
acts,
even
though
federal
legislators
could
not
be.
so
i
think
that
the
separation
of
powers
concerns
that
would
prevent
a
member
of
the
federal
congress
from
being
injured
by
vote
nullification
would
not
necessarily
apply
in
the
same
way
when
you
have
a
state
legislature.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
no,
justice
marshall,
actually
what
we're
asking
you
to
do
is
to
simply
vacate
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
as
moot,
or
to
find
that
there
is
no
standing
here,
and
not
to
reach
the
merits
of
this
case.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
no,
we
don't,
justice
marshall.
in
an
abstract
sense,
of
course,
it's
an
important
issue
on
the
merits
that
we
would
like
to
see
resolved.
but
we
think
it
has
to
await
resolution
in
a
traditional
case
or
controversy,
and
that
just
because
congress
and
the
president
are
ready,
willing
and
able,
as
we
are
today,
debate
the
merits
of
the
issue--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--we
do
believe
it
is
moot.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
we
think
that
would
be
sufficient
to
dispose
of
the
case.
alternatively,
we
think
there's
no
standing,
and
that
would
be
sufficient
to
dispose
of
it.
the...
if
i
could
just
return
to
the
point
about
publication
briefly
before
turning
to
the
merits,
the
publication
statutes,
if
they
are
not
being
carried
out
faithfully
by
the
executive,
involves
the
same
kind
of
question
of
nonexecution
of
the
law
as
h.r.
4042
generally.
and
that
is
that
if
in
fact
the
president
is
not
complying
with
the
bill
publication
statutes,
a
suit
to
compel
him
to
publish
a
bill
would
be
like
a
suit
to
compel
him
to
comply
with
h.r.
4042
and
cut
off
aid
to
el
salvador;
a
suit
over
whether
or
not
the
laws
are
being
properly
executed.
and
so
we
think
in
any
event--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--well,
we
do
suggest
that
there
would
be
a
lack
of
a
cause
of
action.
but
we
also
believe
that
even
if
congress
tried
to
give
itself
one--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--not
by
bringing
a
lawsuit.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
this
court
in--
mr.
richard
k.
willard
--we
think...
we
think
that
there
is
no
cause
of
action
under
the
bill
publication
statutes,
because
one
was
not
intended
among
other
things.
but
even
if
congress
tried
to
give
itself
a
cause
of
action,
we
would
contend
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
it
can
be
jurisdictional.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
well,
justice
white,
we're
happy
to
win
however
we
do.
but
it's
a...
we
think
it
can
be
considered
in
either
terms.
if
i
could
turn
briefly,
though,
to
the
merits
in
the
event
the
court
reaches
those
merits,
of
our
interpretation
of
the
pocket
veto
clause,
the
respondents
repeatedly
accuse
us
of
advocating
a
formalistic
interpretation
of
the
pocket
veto
clause.
and
i
want
to
say
that
i
am
happy
to
embrace
that
label.
i
can
think
of
no
other
provision
in
the
constitution
that
deserves
a
wooden,
mechanical,
formalistic
construction,
other
than
article
i,
section
7.
this
is
a
provision
of
the
constitution
that
cries
out
for
clarity
and
certainty
of
application,
as
opposed
to
a
judicial
construction
that
flexibly
applies
the
underlying
values
of
the
framers
to
the
changing
conditions
that
may
apply
at
any
given
time.
congress
and
the
president
need
to
know
what
the
rules
are.
they
need
to
know
how
this
provision
of
the
constitution
works.
and
then
each
can
conduct
themselves
accordingly.
respondents
have
suggested
that
the
pocket
vet
is
a
weapon
that
can
be
used
by
the
president
to
change
the
balance
of
power
with
congress,
but
this
is
not
true.
whenever
a
bill
is
pocket
vetoed,
congress
has
suffered
a
self-inflicted
wound.
because
congress
controls
the
timing
of
the
presentment
of
bills
to
the
president.
and
congress
controls
the
timing
of
its
adjournments.
and
for
those
reasons,
congress
need
never
allow
the
pocket
veto
to
apply.
as
this
court
observed
in
the
pocket
veto
case,
pocket
vetoes
are
not
the
president's
fault,
but
instead,
are
attributable
solely
to
the
action
of
congress
in
adjourning
before
the
time
allowed
the
president
for
returning
the
bill.
now,
much
has
been
made
of
the
fact
that
many
bills
are
in
fact
presented
to
the
president
shortly
before
an
adjournment
in
the
modern
practice
of
congress,
and
that
therefore,
allowing
the
president's
pocket
veto
power
to
be
exercised
would
give...
would
allow
a
lot
of
these
bills
to
be
absolutely
vetoed.
but
that's
really
a
static-state
analysis.
that's
assuming
that
congress
would
handle
its
adjournment
and
bill
presentment
practices
exactly
the
same
without
regard
to
how
the
pocket
veto
clause
is
construed.
congress
has
the
power,
under
existing
practices,
to
control
the
presentment
of
bills,
and
to
control
adjournments,
so
if
it
doesn't
want
to
allow
the
pocket
veto
clause
to
apply,
it
can
avoid
it.
moreover,
even
if
a
bill
is
pocket
vetoed,
it's
not
that
drastic,
because
it
can
be
reenacted.
if
in
fact
two-thirds
of
each
house
is
interested
in
overriding
a
presidential
veto,
then
obtaining
reenactment
by
a
simple
majority
in
each
house,
and
representment
to
the
president
when
they
reconvene,
should
not
be
that
much
of
a
problem.
the
main...
the
position
of
the
respondents
about
how
the
pocket
veto
should
operate
is,
that
the
president
should
be
required,
when
congress
has
adjourned
between
or
within
sessions,
to
return
a
bill
with
his
objections
to
an
agent
who
will
hold
the
president's
message,
and
then
present
it
to
the
originating
house
of
congress
when
it
returns
and
reconvenes.
we
have
no
doubt
that
this
kind
of
a
rule
could
work,
or
that
it
would
not
drastically
alter
the
balance
of
power
in
the
government.
but
it's
a
rule
that
has
been
repeatedly
rejected
by
the
framers
of
the
constitution,
by
presidents
and
congresses
since
the
administration
of
james
madison,
and
by
this
court,
unanimously,
in
the
pocket
veto
case.
turning
first
to
the
framers,
the
court
on
several
occasions
has
recognized
that
the
new
york
constitution
of
1777
provided
the
model
for
what
turned
out
to
be
article
i,
section
7,
the
process
of
enacting
legislation.
the
first
draft
of
this
article,
like
the
constitution
of
new
york
of
1777,
provided
that
if
the
legislature
by
adjourning
prevented
a
return
veto,
that
the
bill
should
be
returned
on
the
first-day
of
the
next
meeting
of
the
legislature.
in
practice,
essentially
the
rule
the
respondents
argue
for
in
this
case.
and
yet,
for
whatever
reason,
the
committee
of
detail
rejected
this
approach,
and
instead,
provided
that
when
a
bill
could
not
be
returned
to
congress
because
of
adjournment,
that
it
would
not
become
law,
rather
than
being
held
over
and
presented
to
congress...
returned
to
congress
when
it
reconvened.
this
is
the
construction
that's
been
given
to
this
clause
by
presidents
throughout
our
history,
going
back
to
james
madison.
a
total
of
272
bills
have
been
pocket
vetoed
after
sine
die
adjournments
of
congress
in
our
country's
history.
only
three
have
ever
been
returned
to
congress
after
sine
die
adjournments
prior
to
the
court
of
appeals'
decision
in
this
case,
two
by
president
ford
and
one
by
president
carter.
finally,
this
court's
decision
in
the
pocket
veto
case,
where
the
court
unanimously
adopted
the
construction
of
the
pocket
veto
clause
that
we're
urging
today.
given
this
long
history
of
a
settled
interpretation
of
the
pocket
veto
clause,
and
the
evidence
of
the
drafting
history
it
went
through,
it's
our
contention
that
the
application
made
by
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
is
an
unjustified
departure
from
a
well
settled
rule
for
determining
this
kind
of
a
situation.
unless
there
are
any
further
questions
from
the
court,
i'll
conclude
my
argument
for
now.
mr.
richard
k.
willard
mr.
chief
justice,
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
make
was
on
the
question
about
return
to
an
agent,
which
i
think
is
something
of
a
red
herring.
it
is
not
at
all
our
position
that
the
president
has
to
personally
traipse
up
capitol
hill,
bill
in
hand,
and
hand
it
to
congress
while
they're
all
sitting
in
session
to
receive
it.
our
point
is,
though,
that
the
constitution
when
it
provides
for
the
return
of
bills
to
congress
with
objections
has
something
in
mind
other
than...
this
is
what
the
pocket
veto
court
had...
giving
it
to
an
agent
who
can
hold
it
for
weeks
or
months
and
then
present
it
to
congress
when
they
return.
the
constitution
in
article
i,
section
7...
describes
how
a
president
should
return
a
bill.
it
says
he
shall
return
it
with
his
objections
to
that
house
in
which
it
shall
have
originated
who
shall
enter
the
objections
at
large
on
their
journal
and
proceed
to
reconsider
it.
now,
we
have
no
quarrel
with
the
practice
of
handing
it
to
an
agent,
as
the
wright
court
said,
during
a
brief,
three
day
or
less
recess,
because
then
congress
can
immediately...
or
within
a
short
period
of
time...
enter
it
on
their
journal
and
proceed
to
reconsider
it.
what
the
pocket
veto
court
held,
and
what
the
wright
court
did
not
overrule,
was
that
allowing
a
bill
to
remain
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation...
and
that
was
the
court's
language
in
both
pocket
veto
and
wright...
for
days
or
weeks
or
months
during
an
adjournment
is
not
what
the
constitution
had
in
mind.
that's
what
the
new
york
constitution
of
1777
provided
for,
but
the
framers
deliberately
rejected
that
kind
of
model,
and
instead,
provided
for
a
different
set
of
rules
to
govern
the
process.
so
our
position,
then,
is
not
to
be
confused
with
the
question
about
whether
or
not
agents
can
be
used,
but
about
whether
or
not,
when
congress
has
adjourned
for
a
period
of
days
or
weeks
or
months,
whether
or
not
a
return
veto
must
be
attempted
and
then
held
in
a
state
of
suspended
animation
until
they
return,
or
whether
in
fact
the
pocket
veto
clause
indicates
the
legislative
process
has
to
start
over
from
scratch
at
that
point.
that
was
the
only
point
i
wanted
to
make,
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
an
additional
question.
