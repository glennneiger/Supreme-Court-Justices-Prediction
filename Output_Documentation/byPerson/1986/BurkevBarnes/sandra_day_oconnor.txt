justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
willard,
certainly
coleman
v.
miller
may
have
a
bearing
on
that
insofar
as
the
senate,
as
a
body,
or
the
house,
as
a
body,
is
concerned.
and
there
may
be
some
difference
between
a
suit
by
a
house
or
body
of
congress
as
opposed
to
an
individual
member,
might
there
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
what
about
coleman?
justice
o'connor
mr.
frankel,
would
you
think
that
an
individual
member
of
congress
would
always
have
standing
to
sue
a
member
of
the
executive
branch
to
get
that
member
to
enforce
some
law
that
congress
has
passed?
justice
o'connor
well,
you...
you
think
that
a
member
would
lack
standing
to
do
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
i
guess
only
three
members
of
the
court
joined
the
discussion
of
the
opinion
on
standing.
justice
o'connor
but
only
three
people
joined
the
part
that
discussed
standing,
didn't
they?
justice
o'connor
i
guess
the
dissenters
must
have
implicitly
though
there
was
standing,
but
they
did
not
join
the
court's
opinion
on
it.
