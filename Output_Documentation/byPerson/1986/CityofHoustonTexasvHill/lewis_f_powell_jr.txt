justice
jr.
professor
wright,
i
think,
obviously
you
would
agree
that
the
part
of
the
ordinance
that
deals
with
physical
interruption,
if
that
were
all
that
were
before
us,
would
be
perfectly
lawful.
justice
jr.
physical
interruption
rather
than
speech?
the
pedestrian--
justice
jr.
--preemption,
right.
so
that
leaves
a
speech
component
of
this
ordinance.
are
you
suggesting
you
can't
imagine
any
situation
where
speech
alone
could
interrupt
an
officer
in
the
discharge
of
his
duty?
justice
jr.
the
problem
is
one
that
justice
scalia
raised
on
how
do
you
write
that
out?
justice
jr.
may
i
put
a
very
simple
example
to
you?
let's
assume
a
motorist,
at
a
very
busy
intersection
with
a
traffic
officer
in
the
center
of
the
intersection
directing
traffic
concluded
that
the
officer
had
made
a
dreadful
mistake
and
had
directed
him
or
her
to
move,
or
not
to
move
at
the
right
time.
the
individual
gets
out
of
the
automobile,
goes
over
to
the
officer
and
engages
in
extended
conversation.
heavy
traffic,
the
officer
has
to
try
to
direct
the
traffic
and
the
person
is
interrupting
his
efforts
to
conduct
his
duties.
don't
you
think
that
would
be
unlawful?
justice
jr.
and
the
problem
i
come
back
to
and
this
is
one
you
have
addressed
is
now
one
draws
an
ordinance
that
would
cover
a
situation
like
that
and
yet
not
be
overbroad.
justice
jr.
sometimes
it
involves
language
as
it
occurred
here
that
isn't
just
directed
to
the
policeman,
but
it
stirs
up
a
crowd
as
well
and
the
policeman
worries
about
that.
now
does
he
have
to
wait
until
the
crowd
is
actually
moved
to
violence?
i'm
not
talking
about
expressly
saying
to
the
crowd,
let's
assault
the
policemen,
but
violent
protests
saying,
you
know,
you're
only
doing
this
because
you're
picking
on
someone
and
the
person
was
innocent
and
what
not.
does
the
policeman
really
have
to
wait
until
the
crowd
gets
violent
before
he--
