justice
white
right.
and
he
says,
i
may
do
it
again,
and
so
i
want
to
challenge
the
ordinance.
justice
white
and
said
he
had
standing
to
raise
the
issue.
justice
white
how
do
we
know
that?
justice
white
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
here
say
that
the
conduct
that
was
involved
here
could
constitutionally
be
forbidden?
justice
white
said
this
was
a,
this
was
a
proper,
this
was
a
constitutional
application
of
the
ordinance
but
that
didn't
cure
the
overbreadth
problem.
justice
white
that
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
the
conduct
involved
here
was
subject
to
sanction.
justice
white
it
isn't?
justice
white
so
it
wouldn't,
so
it
didn't
make
any
difference
to
him
whether
it
was
proscribable
or
not?
justice
white
right.
justice
white
why
did
you
take
a
cross
appeal?
justice
white
why
did
you
take
a
cross
appeal?
justice
white
but
you
don't,
you
weren't
appealing
against
any
claim
that
the
ordinance
was
constitutionally
applied
in
this
case?
justice
white
xxx
standing?
justice
white
different
from
o'shea
and
rizzo
and
lyons,
those
cases?
justice
white
that's
what
the
court
of
appeals
thought
too,
i
guess.
justice
white
could
you
think
of
some
valid
applications
of
the
statute
if
there
weren't
this
texas
preemption
doctrine.
justice
white
yes,
a
lot
of
them.
there
are
a
lot
of
them.
there
would
be
a
lot
of
them.
justice
white
absent
the
preemption
doctrine
would
it
be
substantially
overbroad?
justice
white
what
is
your
understanding
of
the
relationship
between
the
overbreadth
doctrine
and
the
ability
to
limit
an
ordinance
in
one
city?
suppose
an
ordinance
covers
a
and
b,
and
a
may
validly
be,
unconstitutionally
be
prohibited.
b
may
not.
and
the
defendant
is
accused
of
a.
but
he
says
that
you
can't
convict
me
as
long
as
this
statute
meets
b,
reaches
b.
i
suppose,
even
though
a
state
court
might
easily
narrow
the
statute
to
constitutional
proportions
that
this
defendant
can't
be
convicted.
justice
white
just
because
he's
done
a.
justice
white
xxx
this
is
in
the
federal
court.
this
is
in
the
federal
court.
justice
white
what
if
there
was?
justice
white
you
couldn't
uphold
the
conviction
though.
you
would
have
to,
without
sending
it
to
the
state
court.
justice
white
i
mean,
you
wouldn't
uphold
the
ordinance.
you
would
say
the
ordinance
is
invalid
until
and
unless
there
is
a
limiting
instruction.
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
that
isn't
what
it
says
at
all,
is
it?
