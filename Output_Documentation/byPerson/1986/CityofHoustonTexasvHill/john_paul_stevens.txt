justice
stevens
why
not?
if
he
inter...,
if
he
was
doing
something
else
at
the
time
why
wouldn't
that
be
a
plain
and
flagrant
case
of
interruption?
if
he
was
directing
traffic
and
you
walked
up
to
him
and
said,
please
tell
me
how
to
find
the
city
hall.
justice
stevens
it
was
done
intentionally.
he
wanted
to
interrupt
so
he
could
find
out
where
the
city
hall
is.
that's
a
plain
violation,
i
think.
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
it
also
says
in
the
execution
of
his
duty
as
i
thought
it,
unless
the
abuser
interrupt
any
policeman
in
the
execution
of
his
duty.
and
i
have
a
traffic
officer
executing,
telling
people
to
stop
and
to
start
and
so
forth.
why
isn't
that
executing
his
duty?
justice
stevens
mr.
collins,
do
you,
i
just
want
to
be
sure
of
one
thing.
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
statistics
that
the,
there
are
about
a
thousand
arrests
every
year
under
this
ordinance?
justice
stevens
and
about
how
many
convictions
under
the
ordinance?
justice
stevens
mr.
collins,
if
that's
the
case
when
they've
repealed
it
and
they're
putting
it
back
in
the
code,
why
don't
they
re-write
it
in
that
fashion?
cause
it
surely,
on
its
face,
it's
much
broader
than
that.
you
would
agree
to
that.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
just
the
very
change
of
the
words
from
execution
of
his
duty
to
during
an
investigation
which
carve
out
a
big
chunk
of
this
ordinance.
and
i
don't
know
why
the
prosecutor
doesn't
tell
the
city
counsel
that
when
they've
got
the
thing
on
the
shelf
over
there.
