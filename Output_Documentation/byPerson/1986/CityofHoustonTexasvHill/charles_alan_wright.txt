mr.
charles
alan
wright
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
if
the
court
please
i'd
like
to
begin,
i
suffer
from
the
disadvantage
that
mr.
collins
does
that
i
was
not
present
at
the
trial
in
municipal
court,
but
i
think
on
the
basis
of
what
is
in
the
record
that
several
of
the
answers
that
he
gave
were
not
wholly
accurate.
we
have
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
three,
the
judgment
as
signed
by
the
state
judge
on
that
day
in
april
1982
and
it
says:
"this
day
this
cause
was
called
for
trial
and
both
parties
appeared,
announced
ready
for
trial
and
the
defendant
pleaded
not
guilty
and
the
court
having
heard
the
evidence
is
of
the
opinion
that
the
defendant
is
not
guilty
it
as
charged.
"
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--it
is
certainly
inconsistent,
mr.
chief
justice,
with
his
answer
to
you
that
the
defendant
was
not
tried.
the
defendant
was
surely
tried.
it
was
not
a
dismissal
on
some
legal
reason,
it
is
an
entry
of
the
judgment
that
he
is
not
guilty
and
to
me
that
amounts
to
an
acquittal.
in
response
to
a
question
from
justice
o'connor
about
the
status
of
the
ordinance,
mr.
collins
said
that
in
an
early
stage
in
the
code
revision
process,
the
thought
was
that
possibly
the
ordinance
should
be
repealed.
if
you
will
look
at
the
footnote
at
the
bottom
of
page
eleven
of
our
brief,
we
state
the
fact
that
the
city,
the
houston
city
council
unanimously
passed
motion
number
811303
on
april
7th,
1981,
approving
the
city
legal
department's
recommendation
to
omit
the
ordinance
from
what
ultimately
became
the
revised
1985
code
of
ordinances.
so
that
it
was
not
merely
a
thought
that
possibly
we
will
repeal
the
ordinance.
it
was
an
act
by
the
city
council
saying
in
the
new
code
of
ordinances
this
is
not
to
appear--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--that's
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
would
have
been
had
the
city
attorney
not
in
the
request
for
council
action
in
1985
said,
do
not
include
section
3411a
in
the
new
code
but
do
not
repeal
it
also
because
we
are
currently
involved
in
a
lawsuit.
we
might
have
to
pay
substantial
attorney's
fees
if
we
repealed
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
is
not
repealed,
no.
no,
it
is
still
on
the
books.
but
it
is
on
the
books
as
the
record,
as
the
actions
of
the
houston
city
council
clearly
show
only
because
of
the
pendency
of
this
lawsuit.
getting
to
the
constitutional
issue
itself,
it
seems
to
me
common
ground
here
that
this
ordinance
has
unconstitutional
applications.
in
its
jurisdictional
statement
at
page
seven,
the
city
said,
"on
its
face
the
ordinance
can
be
applied
to
a
wide
variety
of
activities,
some
of
which
concededly
cannot
constitutionally
be
punished.
"
and
again
at
page
eleven
of
that
document,
"since
the
state
courts
may
yet
limit
the
ordinance's
application
to
proscribable
conduct.
"
and,
judge
higginbotham
speaking
for
the
seven
dissenting
justices,
judges
in
the
court
of
appeals,
"because
the
houston
ordinance
is
undeniably
susceptible
to
applications
that
would
impermissibly
regulate
or
proscribe
protected
speech.
"
xxx.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
sir.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
it
is
not.
judge
higginbotham
in
his
dissent
says
that
we
are
all
agreed
that
the
ordinance
was
unconstitutionally
applied.
judge
ruben
in
the
majority
opinion
does
not
speak
to
that
issue.
in
his
majority
opinion
in
the
panel
he
specifically
said
we
are
not
deciding
that
issue.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
no,
on
the
view
that
he
took
of
the
case
he
found
it
invalid
for
overbreadth--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--did
not,
as
we
read
the
opinion,
reach
the
issue
of
as
applied.
that
is
the
subject
of
a
cross
appeal--
--that
we
took
and
on
which
this
court
has
not
yet
ruled.
because
[inaudible]--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--pardon?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
to
collect
damages
since
he
held
that
we
were
not
entitled
to
damages
and
also
that
for
reasons
that
we
did
not
fathom
that
we're
not
entitled
to
have
expunged
record
of
mr.
hill's
arrest.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
we
are
taking
a
cross
appeal
from
the
failure
to
award
us
remedies
to
which
we
believe
that
we
are
entitled.
the
question
was
the
ordinance
constitutionally
applied
in
this
case
hardly
can
arise,
justice
white,
because
the
ordinance
does
not
apply
to
this
case.
raymond
hill
was
acquitted.
the
conduct
that
was
the
centerpiece
of
all
the
discussion
here
was
found
by
the
state
court
not
to
be
a
violation
of
the
ordinance.
the
cases
here,
in
response
to
justice
marshall's
question
because
raymond
hill,
having
been
arrested
four
times
for
violation
of
this
ordinance,
never
having
been
convicted,
has
what
all
of
the
judges
below
thought
was
reason
to
believe
that
this
is
a
significant
threat
that
it
may
happen
to
him
in
the
future
and--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--that's
what
gives
him
standing,
right.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i,
the
judges
below
thought
so
and
i
submit
so,
yes.
that
this,
this
is
a
much
stronger
case
for
standing
than
for
example
steffel
where
there
has
never
even
been
one
arrest,
but
in
which
the
person
sees
that
his
companion
is
arrested
and
so
he
brings
the
action
for
a
declaratory
judgment
that--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--that,
that,
that
seems
to
me
a
fair
statement,
justice
marshall.
[laughter]
mr.
charles
alan
wright
yes,
i
think
so.
but
we
have
an
ordinance
that
everyone
agrees
reaches
some
forms
of
speech
that
are
constitutionally
protected.
on
the
other
side,
the
argument
then
really
is
not
is
this
ordinance
overbroad,
of
course
it
is.
the
question
has
to
be
in
the
terms
in
which
this
court
formulates
it,
is
it
substantially
overbroad?
and
there,
our
submission
is
that
it
is
hard
even
to
think
of
a
valid
application
of
the
ordinance
given
the
texas
preemption
doctrine.
the
texas
preemption
doctrine
has
been
something
that
is,
something
that
is
very
hard
to
persuade
the
city
to
acknowledge
the
reality
of.
they
know
about
it.
the
city
attorney's
memorandum
to
the,
to
the
city
council
on
why
he
recommended
in
1981
that
the
ordinance
be
repealed
says
because
it's
all
covered
by
the
texas
penal
code.
the
issue
of
preemption
has
been
raised
by
my
colleague,
mr.
maness
at
every
stage
in
this
case
and
yet
it
is
not
until
the
city's
reply
brief
in
this
court
that
it
mentions
for
the
first
time
that
there
is
even
a
doctrine
that
city
ordinances
cannot
work
in
the
same
field
in
which
there
are
state
statutes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i,
can't
recall
the
case
either,
but
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--no,
it
may
well
be
out
on
principle
that
has
to
be
the
result
i
submit,
mr.
chief
justice,
that
the
reason
for
broderick
v.
oklahoma
and
for
the
substantial
overbreadth
is
that
if
a
statute
in
most
of
its
applications
is
valid
then
we're
not
going
to
strike
it
even
though
there
is
some
imprecision
and
the
stretch
is
too
far
at
the
outside.
but
if
it
turns
out
that
the
statute,
though
making
a
pretty
verbal
display
of
covering
a
lot
of
conduct
that
validly
can
be
prohibited,
in
fact
doesn't,
and
i
don't
think
it's
a
question
of
30
percent,
i
would
be
very
hard
put
and
be
happy
to
hear
mr.
collins
help
us
with
a
single
instance
in
which
the
ordinance
can
validly
be
applied
today
as
a
matter
of
texas
law
to
conduct
that
is
not
constitutionally
protected.
he
gave
examples
in
his
opening
argument
that,
i
think
he
discounts
the
full
range
of
texas
statutes.
article
38.05,
for
example,--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--well
sure.
assaulting
a
policeman.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
would
be
a
lot
of
them.
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
becomes
a
very
close
question
because
i
think
there
are
so
many
impermissible
applications
and
it
is
used
in
practice
so
often
in
an
impermissible
way.
but
i
think,
given
the
preemption
doctrine
that
there...
i
have
not
yet
been
able
to
think
of
a
single
valid
application
of
the
statute
to
something
that
would
not
be
constitutionally
protected.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
there
is
a
great
deal,
justice
scalia,
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
as
this
court
seems
to
have
formulated
it,
that
i
find
very
strange
indeed.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
would
do
well
as
it
twice
has
in
justice
blackmun's
opinion
in
munson
and
in
justice
white's
opinion
in
ferber
to
read
professor
monahan's
article
in
the
1981
supreme
court
review,
i
think
it
offers
analytically
sound
approach
to
all
of
this
that
gets
you
out
of
a
lot
of
the
verbal
traps
of
the
sort
that
you
have
just
instanced.
but
the
real
issue
is
not
how
do
we
count
up
the
number
of
valid
and
invalid
things,
it's
really
a
less
restrictive
means
approach.
is
there
a
way
that
the
state
can
accomplish
its
legitimate
purpose
of
protecting
the
police
without
sweeping
into
interference
with
people's
rights
to
express
themselves.
that,
i
think,
is
the
way
you
ought
to
come
to
overbreadth
problems.
but
here,
i
submit,
there
really
is
very
little,
if
anything,
that
is
a
valid
application
of
this
statute.
and
i
was
especially
pleased
to
hear
my
friend,
mr.
collins,
refer
the
court
to
page
77
of
the
joint
appendix,
officer
kelley's
testimony
that
it's
only
in
the
course
of
an
investigation
you
do
this.
because
i
was
re-reading
the
joint
appendix
this
week-end
and
something
struck
me
that
somehow
i'd
missed
the
significance
of
it
in
all
my
other
preparation
of
the
case.
on
that
very
page,
officer
kelley
says
that
in
the
course
of
my
investigations
i
have
been
interrupted
thousands
of
times
without
making
an
arrest.
and
the
court
intervenes;
judge
deanda
says:
how
often
have
you
made
an
arrest
for
violation
of
this
ordinance?
and
officer
kelley
says:
twice,
this
case
and
one
other
that's
referred
to.
it
seems
to
me
the
danger
in
an
ordinance
where
an
officer
feels
that
i've
been
interrupted
thousands
of
times
and
he
only
makes
an
arrest
twice
suggests
that
the
real
flaw
in
this
ordinance
is
that
it
does
give
such
wide
discretion
to
the
arresting
officer
to
decide
what
is
an
interruption
and
what
is
not.
but,
even
if
the
person
he
arrests
is
acquitted,
as
raymond
hill
was,
to
be
arrested
and
to
spend
18
hours
in
jail
is
not
insignificant.
the
probability,
i
hardly
need
remind
this
court
is
that
sweeping
statutes
of
this
kind
are
not
likely
to
be
used
against
people
who
wear
three-pieced
suits.
they
are
likely
to
be
used
against
those
who
are
not
at
the
top
of
the
ladder
socially.
i
well
remember
in
1967,
the
night
before
the
texas/oklahoma
game,
i
was
in
dallas
and
observing
what
i
observed,
what
i
thought
to
be
improper
police
force
in
arresting
a
young
man
for
allegedly
jaywalking,
my
friend
and
i
went
to
every
police
officer
in
sight
and
said:
officer,
i
want
to
get
your
name
and
badge
number
for
the
1983
action
i
am
bringing
monday
morning.
and
the
officers
were
all
very
cooperative
and
indeed
we
didn't
have
a
pen
so
we'd
have
to
say,
would
you
please
lend
us
your
pen
and
they
would.
now
i
am
glad
that
the
game
was
played
in
dallas
and
not
in
houston
because
i
take
it
that
i
would
have
violated
the
ordinance,
although
it
seems
to
me
highly
unlikely
that
i
would
have
been
prosecuted
for
violating
it.
i'd
like
to
change
slightly,
it
i
may,
an
example
that
was
discussed
during
mr.
collins'
argument
and
put
it
in
the
terms
that
the
american
civil
liberties
union
did
in
its
amicus
brief.
let
us
suppose
that
we
have
a
police
officer
who
is
actually
writing
a
ticket
and
someone
comes
up
to
him
and
says,
excuse
me
officer,
a
man
was
shot
in
the
next
block.
i
do
not
see
any
way
one
can
read
that
ordinance
without
concluding
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
ordinance
even
though
it
is
hard
to
see
how
you
protect
the
police
or
what
social
value
there
is
in
purporting
to--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--it's
awfully
hard,
mr.
chief
justice,
when
you
have
an
ordinance
that
says,
"in
any
manner
interrupt".
now
there's
been
talk
here
of
getting
a
limiting
construction
or
perhaps
belatedly
after
five
years
of
litigation
sending
the
case
over
to
see
if
the
state
court
will
tell
us
what
it
means.
i
do
not
see
how
a
state
court
can
put
a
limiting
construction
on
it
in
the
sense
of
any
valid
interpretative
process
clear
where
there
is
no
legislative
history
of
what
the
houston
city
council
meant
in
1886
when
it
originally
adopted
the
ordinance
of
the
words
themselves,
"in
any
manner
interrupt".
those
are
very
broad
words.
it
is
hard
to
say
as
a
matter
of
interpretation
they
apply
only
to
physical
conduct
or
things
of
that
sort.
if
there
is
a
need
in
houston
that
is
not
covered
by
the
state
statutes
and
i
commend
particularly
to
the
court
the
statement
we
quoted,
pages
17
and
18
of
our
brief,
from
the
committee
that
drew
up
the
texas
penal
code
in
1974.
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
sensitive,
thoughtful
statement
of
why
we
aren't
legislating
more
broadly
than
we
are
in
this
murky
constitutional
waters
of
disorderly
conducts.
but
if
there
is
a
need
that
is
met
here,
the
way
to
achieve
that
need
is
not
to
ask
some
court
to
pretend
that
we
are
interpreting
the
intention
of
the
houston
city
council.
it
is
for
the
houston
city
council
to
adopt
an
ordinance
that
will
address
itself
to
the
things
it's
concerned
about
that
are
not
already
adequately
protected
against
by
state
legislation.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
of
course
i
would.
but
i
would
go
on,
justice
scalia,
to
say
that
that's
something,
that
what
is
needed
is
a
narrowly
drawn,
regulatory
statute
rather
than
trying
to
breathe
validity
into
obsolete
meanings
of
the
word
in
a
century
old
ordinance.
just
have
the
state
court
interpret
it,
to
put
in
a
modern
word
for
what
the
old
one
was,
right?
well
is
that
a
valid
part
of
the
interpretive
process?
i
would
wonder
about
that.
and
i
wonder
even
whether
there
is
anyway
to
get
a
state
court
interpretation
of
it.
we
now
have
a,
have
had
since
january
1st
a
certification
procedure
in
texas.
but
whether
a
texas
court,
given
their
historic
reluctance
in
these
matters,
is
likely
in
fact
to
answer
some
general
question
about
the
meaning
of
the
ordinance
seems
to
me
quite
unlikely.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--i
think
that
it
would,
depends
on
how
the
case
comes
to
you.
if
the
case
has
come
up
through
a
state
court,
you--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--in
that
case
you
would
consider
whether
there
is
a
realistic
possibility
of
a
limiting
construction
from
the
state
court.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
if
there
is
a
realistic
possibility
then
abstention
becomes
possible--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--in
federal
court,
you
wouldn't
be
upholding
a
conviction
i
wouldn't
think.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
you
would
either
say
it's
invalid
or
if
there
seemed
a
reasonable,
a
real
possibility
of
getting
an
answer
by
abstention
from
the
state
court,
you
might
abstain.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
it
seems
to
that
justice
o'connor
in
the
hawaiian
housing
case
to
which
we
heard
reference
early
today
made
the
very
important
point
that
there
are
always
possibilities.
possibilities
are
not
enough
for
abstention,
that
the
test
be
something
that
is
realistically
likely
to
happen.
and
i
think
that
anyone
who
studies
the
practices
of
the
texas
courts
in
matters
of
this
sort
plus
the
problems
in
trying
to
put
a
construction
on
this
ordinance
would
have
to
say
that
it
is
not
realistically
likely
to
happen.
i
would
have--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--well
you
can
if
mr.
hill
wants
to
be
a
guinea
pig
i
suppose
we'll
have
to
test
the
certification
procedure.
but
i
wonder,
justice
o'connor,
what
question
it
is
that
you
would
put
to
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
other
than,
can
you
think
of
a
constitutional
meaning
for
this
ordinance
and
if
all
the
texas
court
of
criminal
appeals
can
say
is,
well
it
would
be
unconstitutional
if
it
applied
merely
to
speech
so
we
will
say
that
it
only
applies
to
physical
conduct,
then
in
effect
what
you
have
done
is
simply
given
the
state
court
the
first
opportunity
to
decide
that
you
can't
apply
it
because
of
the
federal
constitution
contrary
to
what
wisconsin
v.
constantineau
indicates
is
the
appropriate
practice.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
would
have
considerable
difficulty
still--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--i
would
have,
not
at
all,
justice
scalia,
and
i
am
glad
that
you
addressed
that
point
because
it
seems
to
me
that
these
ordinances
that
are
contained
in
the
reply
brief
are
a
remarkably
unhelpful
collection
of
things,
many
of
them
on
their
face,
have
no
possible
application.
the
very
first
one,
page
1-a,
the
federal
statute,
whoever
forcibly
assaults.
page
2-a,
the
alabama
and
alaska
statutes
both
are
resisting
or
interfering
with
arrest
and
the
alaskan
one
requires
force,
risk
of
physical
injury
to
any
person.
that
is
true
of
many
of
those.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
but
that
doesn't
help
us.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
with
respect,
i
don't
think,
i
do
not
agree
that
it
is.
they
make
rather
fun
in
their
brief,
of
the
fact
that
we
say
the
texas
disorderly
conduct
statute,
42.01,
covers
much
of
the
ground
that
34.11
does
and
yet,
the
texas
disorderly
conduct
statute
is
not
the
ancient,
vague
sorts
of
disorderly
conduct
statute
that
this
court
has
worried
with
in
the
past.
it
bears
a
clear
ancestry
from
the
model
penal
code
and
seems
to
me
a
remarkably
careful
statute.
i'm
not
saying
that
i
couldn't
imagine
some
constitutional
problems
with
it,
but
that
on
the
whole
i
would
have
no
difficulty
with
it.
but
even
with
regard
to
those
statutes
and
ordinances
here
that
use
words
that
on
their
face
might
appear
to
reach
the
kind
of
situation
we
are
talking
about,
we
don't
know
anything
until
we
know,
(a)
how
is
that
statute
or
ordinance
interpreted,
if
it
has
been
in
the
state,
and
(b)
how
in
fact
is
it
used
in
practice?
for
example,
they
we
here
in
their
appendix
at
page
23,
a
utah
statute.
and
then
they
also
have
a
salt
lake
city
ordinance
at
page
34-a.
in
our
brief,
in
the
footnote
on
page
22,
we
have
cited
to
you
a
utah
case
in
which
the
court
says:
we
cannot
believe
that
the
legislature
intended
to
make
it
an
offense
merely
to
interrupt
or
distract
a
policeman.
and
so,
despite
the
breadth
of
language
in
the
utah
statute
and
the
salt
lake
city
ordinance,
what
mr.
hill
was
arrested
for
could
not
have
been
a
criminal
offense
in
utah.
and
i
suspect
that
if
we
were
to
make
an
examination
that
we
would
find
that
either
by
court
interpretation
or
by
administrative
implementation
that
very
few
if
any
places
in
the
country
would
hold
that
the
police
can
arrest
for
matters
as
insignificant
as
the
houston
police
arrest
people
for
by
the
thousands.
in
my
view,
the
court
below
properly
held
the
houston
ordinance
unconstitutional
and
we
urge
you
affirm
it.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
would
be
what,
sir?
mr.
charles
alan
wright
that
would
raise
no
first
amendment
problem.
they
concede
however,
page
ten
of
their
reply
brief
that
that
portion
of
the
ordinance
is
no
longer
enforceable
because
of
the
state
preemption
law.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
oh,
no.
no,
i'm
not
suggesting
that
at
all.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
that
they
can
if
they
need
too.
i
really
doubt
that
they
need
to.
i
think,
for
example,
section
38.05
of
the
state
statutes
on
hindering
an
investigation
is
a
very
good
statute
and
other
portions.
we
have
said
throughout
in
our
brief,
justice
powell,
that
of
course
there
are
times
when
even
words
constitutionally
are
proscribable.
contrary
to
what
is
suggested
in
reply
brief
we
have
never
argued
that
pure
speech
is
all
that's
left.
that
is
if
words
in
themselves
are
a
threat
of
imminent
violence,
you
can
arrest.
if
the
words
are
reasonably
likely
to
incite
others
to
imminent
violence
that
also
can
be
made
criminal.
those
are
the
general,
normal
bounds
that
the
first
amendment
puts
on
the
situation
in
which
words
by
themselves
can
be
regarded
as
closely
enough
brigaded
with
actions
so
that
one
is
inseparable
from
the
other
to
use
justice
douglas's
phrase.
we
think
that
you
can
draw,
if
it
is
needed,
an
ordinance
that
will
reach
those
situations
where
the
city
has
a
valid
concern.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
think
yes.
mr.
charles
alan
wright
i
repeat
that
i
think
it
can
be
done,
but
i
would
take
my
stand
with
the
draftsmen
of
the
texas
penal
code
and
that
portion
of
the
report
at
page
18
of
our
brief
that
in
case
of
doubt
it
is
better
to
under
penalize
than
to
over
penalize.
that
this
is
the
lesson
taught
us
by
our
regard
for
liberty.
that
if
we
have
to
err,
it
is
better
to
err
in
the
direction
of
having
the
policeman
hear
too
much
talk
than
of
arresting
people
for
talking.
you
yourself,
justice
powell,
in
your
concurring
opinions
twice
in
lewis
pointed
out
that
we
should
expect
the
police
to
be
trained
and
to
be
better
able
to
resist
words
that
are
directed
at
them
than
our
populous
generally.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
is
right
and
that
a
policeman
carrying
as
they
normally
do
a
gun
and
with
a
badge
of
authority
that
i
think
they're
going
to
be
able
to
take
care
of
themselves.
i
think--
mr.
charles
alan
wright
--i
think,
justice
scalia,
the
statute
for
example
that
was
upheld
in
colten
v.
kentucky
and
that
seems
to
me
to
address
itself
to
that
kind
of
a
problem
in
a
much
more
effective
way.
the
elements
in
that
statute,
as
the
court
will
remember
are
first,
the
crime
was
not
merely
speaking.
the
crime
was
refusal
to
disperse
in
response
to
a
lawful
order
by
a
law
enforcement
officer
to
do
so.
so
you
had
to
first
be
given
the
order
to
disperse.
it
has
to
be
lawful
or
it
will
fail.
it
must
be
with
intent
to
cause
public
inconvenience,
annoyance,
or
alarm
and
the
kentucky
court
of
appeals
had
put
a
limiting
construction
on
it
that
this
ordinance,
this
statute
does
not
apply
to
thing
that
are
not
predominately
speech,
but
only
to
those
in
which
speech
is
an
incidental
element
of
a
dangerous
situation.
and
this
court
accepted
that
limiting
construction.
i
think
those
show
the
kinds
of
possibilities
there
are
of
protecting
these
perfectly
legitimate
situations
without
allowing
the
police
unfettered
discretion
to
make
arrests
where
it
is
not
legitimate
to
do
so.
