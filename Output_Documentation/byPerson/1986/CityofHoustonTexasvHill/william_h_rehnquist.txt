chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
collins,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
it
go
to
trial?
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx.
and
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
his
challenge
to
the
ordinance.
chief
justice
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
wright.
chief
justice
rehnquist
said
that
could
be
a
form,
mr.
wright,
that
isn't
inconsistent
with
counsel's
oral
statement
here.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
mr.
wright,
perhaps
i
didn't
follow
you
just
then.
i
understood
the
resolution
to
say
it
would
be
omitted
from
the
code
of
ordinances.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
saying
that
inexorably
means
that
it
was
repealed?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it
isn't
repealed.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well
is
that
necessarily
relevant
to
the
constitutional
analysis,
mr.
wright?
supposing
that
we
were
to
conclude
by
some
mathematical
calculation
of
which
you
were
capable
that
this
ordinance
is
capable
of
70
percent
constitutional
application,
30
percent
unconstitutional
application.
if
it
covered,
if
it
could
apply
in
every
situation
which
by
its
terms
it
applied
to.
and,
and
this
court
would
say
under
those
circumstances
it
is
not
substantially
overbroad
this
is
all
hypothetical.
but
then
you
come
in
and
say,
well
yes
but
in
70,
in
half
of
that
70
percent
it
can't
apply
because
of
the
texas
preemptious,
preemption
doctrine.
is
there
a
case
from
this
court
saying
that
if
a,
if
an
ordinance
is
preempted
by
state
law
it,
it
is
not
applicable
for
overbreadth
purposes?
i
can't
recall
any.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
don't
think
there
is
one.
chief
justice
rehnquist
--don't
you
think
the
texas
courts
might
take
that
into
consideration
in
construing
the
ordinance?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--thank
you,
mr.
wright.
mr.
collins,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
collins.
the
case
is
submitted.
