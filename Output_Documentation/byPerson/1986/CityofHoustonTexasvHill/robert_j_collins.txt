mr.
robert
j.
collins
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
raises
serious
questions
about
whether
a
city
can
prohibit
the
intentional
interruption
of
a
police
officer
during
an
investigation
without
infringing
constitutional
rights
protected
under
the
first
amendment.
the
answer
to
this
question
is
of
vital
importance
to
both
the
city
of
houston
and
many
other
cities
and
states
in
this
country.
there
are
three
principle
legal
issues
that
must
be
addressed
by
the
court.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
it
has
not,
your
honor.
in
19--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--that
is
not
correct,
your
honor.
in
1981,
the
city
of
houston
started
out
on
a
code
recodification
process.
that
process
took
approximately
four
years.
our
initial,
one
of
our
initial
recommendations
regarding
this
statute
was
to
possibly
repeal
it.
after
the
hill
suit
came
around
the
city
of
houston
city
council
has
reconsidered
that
recommendation
at
this
point.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
it
is
already
a
permanent
part
of
the
city
of
houston
city
code.
the
fact
that
it
is
not
codified
does
not
affect
its
enforceability
at
all.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
it
was
not
put
in
the
codification
because
at
the
time
of
codification
the
panel
decision
in
the
hill
case
by
the
fifth
circuit
had
been
decided
two
to
one
and
we
were
concerned
that
if
we
did
put
it
in,
it
would
be
inadvertently
be
enforced.
so
if
it's
not
codified
we're
not
enforcing
it
at
the
current
time.
the
legal
issues
before
the
court
center
around
the
application
of
the
overbreadth
doctrine
to
a
core
criminal
conduct
statute.
it's
the
city's
contention
that
the
appellee,
mr.
hill,
was
involved
in
activities
that
were
well
within
the
constitutionally
prescribable
realm
of
core
criminal
conduct,
and
as
such
he
should
not
be
able
to
assert
the
rights
of
other
individuals
not
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
think
the
question
is:
do
the
police
officers
have
probable
cause
to
arrest
somebody
for
violation
of
this
statute?
i
don't
think
we
can
hold
a
statute
unconstitutional
because
an
individual
who
raises
it
was
acquitted.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
he
interfered
intentionally
with
a
police
officer
during
an
investigation.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
there
was
no
jury--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--in
that
case.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
not
correct
either.
the
case
was
dismissed.
it's
not
in
the
record
as
to
why
the
case
was
dismissed.
the
court
reporter
apparently
had
lost
the
notes.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
there
are
a
lot
of
speculative
reasons.
there
could
of
been
a
situation
where
the
judge
felt
that
he
had
made
a
statement
that
prejudged
the
case
and
therefore
that
for
technical
reasons
it
could
nave
been
dismissed.
there
are
a
number
of
reasons,
but
it
is
not
in
the
record
before
this
court
as
to
why
it
was.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
it
did
not
go
to
trial
to
my
knowledge,
no.
the
second
legal
issue
that
we
have
here
is
if
indeed
mr.
hill
is
allowed
to
raise
the
constitutional
rights
of
others
not
before
the
court
and
if
he
can
assert
those
rights,
is
the
ordinances
overbreadth
both
real
and
substantial.
and
again,
in
a
subsidiary
issue
is
a
narrowing
construction
of
the
ordinance
available?
late
one
evening,
early
in
the
morning,
in
1982,
officer
james
kelley
of
the
houston
police
department
and
his
partner
were
on
patrol
in
a
high
crime
area
of
the
city
of
houston.
while
they
were
stopped
and
while
officer
kelley's
partner
was
issuing
a
traffic
citation,
officer
kelley
observed
an
individual
standing
in
the
middle
of
a
street
stopping
traffic.
he
had
stopped
a
city
bus
and
a
number
of
cars.
officer
kelley
approached
the
man
and
directed
the
man
to
the
sidewalk
in
order
to
insure
his
safety
and
attempt
to
unblock
the
traffic
in
the
street.
as
part
of
his
investigation,
officer
kelley
had
been
talking
to
the
man.
as
he
became
more
involved
in
the
investigation,
the
individual
became
erratic
in
his
actions
and
started
to
walk
away
from
officer
kelley.
at
that
point
in
time,
officer
kelley
told
the
man
to
stop,
approached
the
man,
touched
him
on
the
shoulder
to
turn
him
around.
at
that
point
in
time,
officer
kelley
heard
a
voice
from
the
sidewalk
where
a
crowd
was
gathering.
that
voice
was
the
voice
of
the
appellee
in
this
case,
ray
hill.
mr.
hill
yelled
at
officer
kelley,
told
him
to
leave
the
man
alone;
he
hadn't
done
anything
wrong.
officer
kelley
continued
to
speak
to
the
man.
he
continued
with
his
investigation.
ray
hill
also
continued.
he
continued
to
yell
at
officer
kelley
in
a
loud
and
boisterous
voice,
"leave
him
alone,
why
don't
you
pick
on
somebody
your
own
size.
"
mr.
hill
yelled.
officer
kelley
then
asked
hill
if
he
was
interrupting
him
in
his
capacity
as
a
police
officer.
mr.
hill
replied,
"yes,
why
don't
you
pick
on
somebody
my
size.
"
at
that
point
in
time,
officer
kelley,
being
concerned
with
the
gathering
crowd,
concerned
about
the
possibility
of
violence
and
feeling
that
ray
hill
was
baiting
him,
and
challenging
him,
and
interrupting
him
in
his
investigation,
arrested
mr.
hill
and
charged
him
with
the
violation
of
the
ordinance
at
issue
here.
the
precise
wording
of
the
ordinance
at
issue
here
is:
"it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
person
to
assault,
strike,
or
in
any
manner
oppose,
molest,
abuse
or
interrupt
any
policeman
in
the
execution
of
his
duty,
or
any
person
summoned
to
aid
in
making
an
arrest.
"
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
believe
that
your
question,
justice
scalia,
was,
was
he
acquitted?
he
was
found
not
guilty.
yes,
that
is
a
true
statement.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
what
happened,
well
it's
outside
the
record,
but
he
was
not,
the
trial
was
interrupted
in
the
middle.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
the
fact
that
the
trial,
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
judge--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--right.
the
fact
that
the
trial
court
judge
announced
that,
made
a
statement
in
front
of
counsel
for
mr.
hill
that
he
felt
mr.
hill
was
guilty,
statement
was
in
front
of
the
jury,
he
felt
that
he
had
pre-judged
the
case
and
so
he
found
him
not
guilty
at
that
point
in
time.
that
is
my
recollection
of
what
happened.
that
is
not
in
the
record;
however,
before
this
court.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no,
i
was
not.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that's
correct,
there
was.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
distinguish
it
from
acquittal
because
i
took
the
word
acquittal
to
mean
that
it
was
submitted
to
the
jury,
the
jury
deliberated
and
found
that
he
was
not
guilty.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
he
was
not
convicted,
no.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
robert
j.
collins
because
the
individual
has
raised
the
argument
that
the
city
of
houston
is
unconstitutional,
unconstitutionally
denying
him
the
right
to
exercise
his
rights
of
free
speech
in
the
area
and
at
the
scene
of
arrest
in
the
city
of
houston.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
he
has
not
been
convicted
under
the
ordinance.
he's
been
arrested
four
times
under
it.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that's
precise,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
the
fifth
circuit
sustained
his
challenge
to
the
ordinance--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--said
he
had
standing
to
raise
the
issue,
found
the
ordinance
over
broad.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
they
took
it
under
en
banc
consideration
and
held
eight
to
seven
that
mr.
hill
had
standing
and
that
the
ordinance
was
over
broad.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
don't
think
so,
justice
marshall.
[laughter]
i
think
that
there
is
a
legitimate
interest
that
a
city
has
in
protecting
its
police
officers
while
they
are
involved
in
investigations,
interference,
and
interruption.
the
ordinance
itself
does
not
contain
a
scienter
requirement.
but
the
scienter
requirement
is
added
by
state
law.
state
law
in
texas
requires
that
all
ordinances
have
a
scienter
requirement.
therefore
in
this
case
an
individual
cannot
be
convicted
under
this
ordinance
unless
he
knowingly
interferes
with
a
police
officer
in
the
performance
of
his
duties.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
scienter
requires
that
you
have
an
intent
to
interrupt
the
officer.
if
you
do
not
have--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--if
you
do
not
have
an
intent
to
interfere
with
an
officer--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--interfere
with
the
officer
means
to
interrupt
him
during
the
course
of
his
duties.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
the
scienter
requirement
does
not
require
that.
scienter
requirement
would--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--allow
you
to
have
probable
cause.
a
police
officer
would
not
go
out
and
arrest
somebody
under
a
statute
on
the
basis
that
they
walked
up
to
them
and
asked
them,
could
you
please
tell
me
how
to
get
to
the
police
office
downtown.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
unless
the,
it
was
done
intentionally--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--i
don't
think
it
is.
first
of
all
i'm
not
sure
whether
or
not
in
the
particular
instance
that
we're
discussing
that
the
officer
would
be
involved
in
an
investigation
and
the
record
is
clear
that
the
only
time
that
this
ordinance
is
enforced
is
during
an
investigation.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
the
term
execution
of
his
duties
is
limited
by
the
fact
that
officers
only
arrest
people
for
interrupting
them
during
investigations.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
in
the
record.
joint
appendix,
page
77,
where
officer
kelley
testified
that
that
was
his
view
of
the
law.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
but
on
the
other
hand
if
the
statute
doesn't
cover
those
areas
then
what
you're
saying
the
overbreadth
doctrine
is
there
for
is
to
prevent
the
city--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--no,
we
do
not.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
think
that
it
makes
it
less
overbroad
in
the
fact
that
if
we
looking
at
whether
the
statute
is
overbroad,
we
have
to
look
at
whether
it's
real
and
substantial
overbreath.
and,
if
indeed,
the
only
enforcement
ambit
of
the
statute
is
intentional
interference
during
an
arrest,
there
are
not
too
many
types
of
protected
speech
that
could
be
alleged
to
be
used
in
that
circumstance.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
would
also
refer
you,
justice
scalia,
to
the
complaint
which
is
on
page
two
of
the
joint
appendix
which
states
that
people
are
charged
for
interrupting,
willfully,
intentionally
interrupting
a
police
officer
during
an
investigation.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
there
are
three
texas
statutes
that
would
cover
assault.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes,
they
do
to
that
extent.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes.
i
think
that
the
instances
in
the
record
are
prime
examples
of
it.
the
cameramen
who
were
involved
on
the
crime
scene,
interfering
with
the
officers
in
two
cases.
the
individual
who
attempted
to
hold
back
the
officers
that
were
making
a
vice
investigation
into
a
club.
those
instances
have
been
characterized
by
the
counsel
in
the
lower
court
in
this
case
as
being
representative
of
the
way
the
ordinance
is
enforced.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
think
that
the
ordinance's
legitimate
scope
should
be
limited
to
intentional
acts
during
an
investigation
where
an
individual
attempts
to
interfere
or
interrupt
a
police
officer.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
think
it
did,
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that's
correct.
that
was
the
holding
of
the
fifth
circuit
en
banc.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
lewis
was
a
case
where
the
statute
was
directly
aimed
at
speech.
lewis
prohibited
opprobrious
language.
our
statute
does
not
prohibit
words,
it
prohibits
conduct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes
you
can,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
that
is
correct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
distinguish
lewis
because
lewis
on
its
face
dealt
with
words,
there
was,
it
was
an
overbroad
statute.
it
simply
said
you
could
not
speak
opprobrious
words
to
anyone.
i
think
we
have
a
statute
here
that
is
entirely
different.
here
we're
talking
about
you
cannot
interrupt
a
police
officer
intentionally
during
an
investigation.
the
only
other
instance--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--if
you
touched
him
or
caused
bodily
injury
it
would
be
covered
by
assault
statute.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
but
if
you
walked
into
the
middle
of
the
investigation,
stood
next
to
the
arresting
officer
and
the
suspect
and
began
talking
in
a
loud
voice
while
he
was
reading
the
miranda
warning
to
the
suspect--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--that's
certainly
is
misconduct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
it's
also
speech
with
action.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no,
it
will
also
apply
to
conduct.
it
can
apply
to
somebody
who
walks
into
the
middle
of
an
investigation.
let's
say
they
were
holding
a
sign
on
the
side
and
the
officer
is
doing
an
investigation
of
somebody
and
they
walk
out
in
the
street
and
while
the
officer
is
interrogating
the
individual
they
take
the
sign
and
they
put
it
right
in
front
of
the
officer
and
the
individual.
they
interfere
with
his--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--i
don't
think
it's
relevant
whether
the
sign
would
say
anything
on
it,
or
not.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
it
would
be,
it
would
be
speech
but
it
would
also
be
conduct.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes,
it
was
directed
at,
only
at
language.
it
was
directed
at
nothing
else.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
directed
at
the
police.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
have
a
whole
area
of
conduct.
i
have
situations
where
somebody
may
drive
a
car
into
the
middle
of
an
investigation
and
park
it
there.
i
have
instances--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--no,
i
am
not
saying
that.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
yes.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
distinguish
lewis
on
the
basis
that
lewis,
the
statute
in
lewis
was
a
statute
that
could
not
apply
to
conduct.
it
was
limited
by
its
words
to
speech.
the
other
thing
that
needs
to
be
made,
as
far
as
the
ordinance
goes,
the
other
point
that
needs
to
be
made
is
that
in
many
instances
this
ordinance
is
violated
by
an
individual
who
refuses
to
obey
an
officer.
in
some
respects
the
ordinance
can
be
characterized
as
a
refusal
to
move
on
ordinance.
the
other
important
factor
to
remember
about
the
ordinance
is
the
ordinance
itself
does
not
include
trivial
and
insignificant
interruptions
within
it's
ambit.
there's
testimony
in
the
record
by
the
city's
chief
prosecutor
that
these
are
not
considered
to
be
violations
under
the
ordinance.
so
what
you
have
is
an
ordinance
that
regulates
and
prohibits.
and
what
it
prohibits
is
within
a
narrow
range.
it
prohibits
conduct
intentionally
done
with
the
view
to
interrupt
and
interfere
with
a
police
officer
at
the
time
that
they're
making
their
investigation.
there
are
a
number
of
statutes
contained
in
the
appendix
to
the
city's
reply
brief
that
use
similar
words
to
the
city's
ordinance.
they
would
use
words
like
hinders,
obstruct.
most
of
them
have
scienter
requirements.
some
of
them
are
a
little
different
in
that
they
do
apply
to
language
by
their
own
terms.
we
feel
that
the
city
ordinance
is
valid
and
these
ordinances
are
also
valid.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
in
response
to
the
argument
about
the
unfettered
discretion
of
the
houston
police
department,
i
think
that
the
testimony
of
officer
kelley
in
the
record
is
a
perfect
example
of
the
fact
that
this
discretion
is
not
abused.
over
a
thousand
instances
of
interruptions
and
only
two
of
them
did
he
feel
qualified
under
the
terms
of
the
ordinance.
in
regards
to
the
fact
that
the
city
of
houston
may
be
able
to
write
a
more
precise
ordinance,
i
feel
we
have
a
precise
ordinance.
it
applies
in
a
very
narrow
band
of
circumstances.
there
are
cases
that
this
court
has
held
before--
mr.
robert
j.
collins
--yes,
we
agree
with
it.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
do
not
know,
your
honor.
insofar
as
the
language
and
what
we
are
prohibiting,
we
are
simply
prohibiting
utterances
intentionally
directed
at
disturbing
a
legitimate
governmental
function.
i
think
this
case
is
very
similar
to
the
situation
that
existed
in
the
grayned
case
where
the
speech,
whether
it
was
violent
or
non-violent,
was
not
allowed
where
it
would
tend
to
disturb
a
school
in
session.
i
think
we
have
the
same
type
of
situation
here.
if
we
have
a
situation
where
the
substantial
reach
of
the
ordinance
covers
situations
that
the
city
has
a
legitimate
interest
in
preventing
and
i
think
in
determining
substantiality
of
overbreadth
that
one
needs
to
weigh
the
substantial
interest
that
the
city
has
against
the
potential
effect
on
speech.
especially
the
potential
chilling
effect
on
speech.
nowhere
today
have
we
heard
anything
about
anyone
who
this
ordinance
has
prevented
them
from
complaining
about
the
incidents
that
mr.
hill
wished
to
complain
about.
those
incidents
can
be
complained
about
in
many
places
and
at
many
times
other
than
at
the
scene
of
an
arrest.
they
can
be
complained
at
city
council.
they
can
be
complained
at
by
picketing
the
police
department,
but
the
fact
that
we
are
involved
in
a
situation
that
is
a
highly
delicate
situation,
that
of
an
investigation,
detention
and
arrest,
makes
it
an
inappropriate
place
to
allow
the
unfettered
exercise
of
freedom
of
speech.
most
of
the
examples
that
we've
talked
about
today
have
been
examples
of
an
officer
walking
up
to,
or
an
officer
writing
a
ticket
and
the
man
comes
up
and
says
he
was
shot
in
the
back
and
he
can
be
arrested.
well,
i
don't
think
he
would
be
arrested
under
that
ordinance.
i
think
a
police
officer
would
turn
around
and
say
where.
part
of
a
police
officer's
job
is
communicating
with
citizens.
but
that's
not
what
we're
dealing
here.
it's
not
an
ordinance
that
says
you
cannot
talk
to
a
police
officer.
it's
not
an
ordinance
that
says
you
cannot
annoy
a
police
officer.
it's
an
ordinance
that
says
you
cannot
obstruct
a
police
officer
who
is
involved
in
an
investigation.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
it
has
a
scienter
requirement
and
the
fact
is
that
the
city
has
applied
it
only
in
investigations.
the
record
is
clear
as
to
the
police
officer
saying
that
that's
what
they
have
to
have,
intent.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
would
agree
on
its
face
it
is,
but
i
also
think
that
this
court
has
in
the
past
taken
cognizance
of
administrative
determinations
and
administrative
constructions
placed
on
it.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
again,
if
we
go
back
and
look
at
what
people
are
charged
with
and
what
they're
tried
for
in
the
appendix,
it
is
willfully,
intentionally
interrupting
an
officer
during
an
investigation.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
no,
it
was
not,
justice
marshall.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
he
was
attempting
to
find
out
why
the
man
was
standing
in
the
middle
of
the
street,
blocking
traffic.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
not
at
this
point
in
time.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
j.
collins
i
believe
the
reason
that
was
given,
and
it's
in
the
record,
is
that
the
individual
wanted
to
stop
traffic
so
he
could
back
a
truck
out
into
the
street.
in
conclusion,
what
i
would
like
to
say
is
that
this
ordinance
is
a
constitutional
regulation
and
it
protects
police
officers
in
the
performance
of
their
duties
without
impinging
and
is
not
on
a
great
deal
protected
free
speech.
