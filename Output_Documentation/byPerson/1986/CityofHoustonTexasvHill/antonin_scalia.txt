justice
scalia
well,
how
can
we
possibly
agree
with
you
on
that
if
the
man
was
acquitted?
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand.
you
said
that
the
actions
committed
by
this
individual
were
plainly
within
what
the
constitution
would
permit
to
be
acted
upon
by
the
police.
justice
scalia
but
that's
not
what
the
jury
found.
justice
scalia
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
scalia
it
was
tried
before
a
judge.
a
judge
found
that
he
hadn't.
justice
scalia
well
is
there
any
other
possible
reason
why
it
would
have
been
dismissed?
justice
scalia
mr.
collins,
can
i
get
something
squared
away?
i
didn't,
in
our
earlier,
i
didn't,
i
understood
your
answer
to
the
chief
justice's
question,
but
it
didn't
comport
with
my
recollection.
you
said
in
your
brief
that
hill
was
later
tried
and
found
not
guilty
of
the
offense.
and
likewise,
the
appellee's
brief
says
the
same
thing.
hill
subsequently
was
found,
not
guilty
of
violating
the
ordinance,
following
a
non-jury
trial
before
a
houston
municipal
court.
now,
was
he
tried
and
found
not
guilty,
or
not?
justice
scalia
well,
i
had
asked
you
whether
he
was
tried
and
i
thought
you
said
he
wasn't
tried.
justice
scalia
by
what?
justice
scalia
found
him
not
guilty.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
were
you
[inaudible]?
justice
scalia
but
the
fact
is
he
was
found
not
guilty.
we
have
to
assume
that
he
was
not,
i
mean,
there's
a,
there
was
a
record
finding
of
not
guilty
whatever
the
reason
for
it
was.
justice
scalia
and
you
distinguish
that
from
an
acquittal?
justice
scalia
what
does
knowingly
interferes
mean?
that
is
your,
whatever
you
say
is
not
involuntary.
you're
not
sleepwalking
or
something
of
that
sort,
but
you
don't
necessarily
have
to
know
that
what
you're
doing
is
a
violation
of
the
law.
scienter
doesn't
require
that.
justice
scalia
whatever
that
means.
justice
scalia
whatever
interfere
with
the
officer
means.
justice
scalia
yes,
whatever
a
court
later
finds
to
constitute
an
interruption.
but
you
certainly,
by
reason
of
the
state's
scienter
requirement,
you
do
not
have
to
know
that
you
are
violating
the
law,
do
you?
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
well
does
that
show
that
the
statute
is
not
overbroad
simply
because
you
don't
use
it
in
those
areas
which
it
shouldn't
properly,
which
it
shouldn't
apply
to?
that
doesn't
prove
that
the
statute
isn't
overbroad.
it
just
proves
that
their
not
using
it
in
the
overbroad
areas.
justice
scalia
but
the
statute
does
cover
it.
all
you're
saying
is
the
enforcement
doesn't
cover
it.
an
overbroad
statute
is
a
statute
whose
statutory
scope,
you
don't
have
a
court
decision
do
you
that
says
it
can't
be
enforced
in
this
other
area.
justice
scalia
so
you're
just
saying
we're
not
enforcing
it
in
the
overbroad
areas,
but
that
doesn't
make
it
any
less
overbroad
it
seems
to
me.
justice
scalia
i
think
that
would
be
a
good
argument
if
you
had
a
court
decision
that
said
this
statute
only
applies
to
arrests,
but
you
don't.
you
told
me
it
applies
to
what
justice
stevens
described.
you're
just
saying,
we
won't
use
it
in
that
situation.
justice
scalia
what,
what,
excuse
me,
what
is
left
other
than
speech
that
isn't
preempted
by
the
other
state
laws?
i
mean,
you
say
interrupt
an
investigation.
how
do
you
do
it
other
than
by
speech
unless
you
physically
stop
the
officer.
that
would
be
covered
by
the
assaulting
an
officer
statute.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
that's
speech.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
does
this
sign
say
something
on
it?
xxx.
justice
scalia
it
isn't?
you
don't
think
it
would
be
speech
if
it
said
something
on
it?
justice
scalia
mr.
wright,
is
it
clear
that
whether
overbroadness
is,
overbreadth
is
substantial
overbreadth
is
determined
on
the
basis
of
proportionality?
what
the
statute
covers
versus
what
the
statute,
properly
covers
versus
what
the
statute
improperly
covers?
because
that
seems
to
me
a
very
strange
doctrine
that
the
same
statute
can
be
valid
or
invalid
depending
upon
whether
its
latched
on
to
another
statute
that
has
a
lot
of
valid
stuff
in
it,
or
not.
this
same
ordinance
could
be
perfectly
all
right
if
it
were
elevated
to
the
state
level
and
put
together
with
the
state
statutes
that
nave
preempted
the
valid
portion
of
it,
or
arguably
that--
justice
scalia
mr.
wright,
the
seconds,
this
is
a
hundred
year
old
ordinance
and
just
for
fun,
i
looked
up
interrupt
in
the
second
webster's
international
and
it
gives
an
obsolete
meaning
of
the
word.
it
says
obsolete,
but
a
hundred
years
is
old
enough
to
obsolesce
i
suppose,
and
the
obsolete
meaning
is
about
the
same
obstruct,
prevent,
something
like
that.
now,
you
know,
if
the
state
court
said
that's
what
it
means,
obstruct
or
prevent,
would
that
be
close
enough
to
validate
it?
i
mean
there
ought
to
be
something
that
covers
actions
including
speech,
i
suppose,
where
an
officer
is
trying
to
make
an
arrest
and
he
gets
a
lot
of
verbal
abuse
from
someone
or
someone
trying
to
excite
a
crowd
against
the
officer.
if
you
would
acknowledge
that
that's
a
legitimate
subject
now.
justice
scalia
suppose
it
just
said,
interrupt
means
obstruct?
justice
scalia
then
you
would
have
considerable
difficulty
with,
not
just
this
ordinance,
but
the
whole
mess
of
ordinances
that
are
included
as
an
appendix
to
the
reply
brief
of
the
state.
justice
scalia
others
that
say
for
example,
any
person
who
shall
in
any
way
or
manner
hinder,
obstruct,
molest,
resist
or
otherwise
interfere
with
any
city
officer.
justice
scalia
it's
very
hard
to
get
more
precise
language
to
prevent
what
they're
trying
to
prevent.
