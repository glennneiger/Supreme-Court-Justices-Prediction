justice
o'connor
mr.
collins,
let
me
inquire
about
that
statement,
that
it's
of
vital
importance
to
houston.
i
thought
that
the
ordinance
there
had
been
repealed
by
the
city
council.
justice
o'connor
and
then
reinstated
just
for
purposes
of
this
litigation.
justice
o'connor
well,
so
what
is
the
status?
it's
going
to
become
a
permanent
part
of
the
houston
city
code
if
you
win
this
lawsuit?
justice
o'connor
well
why
wasn't
it
put
in
the
codification?
justice
o'connor
xxx.
justice
o'connor
how
do
you
distinguish
the
lewis
case
from
this--
justice
o'connor
--well,
but
could
not
the
statute
under
your
interpretation
of
its
legitimate
scope
fall
squarely
under
lewis?
can't
you
interrupt,
can't
you
intend
to
interrupt
an
investigation
or
arrest
by
speech
alone?
justice
o'connor
and
so
in
your
view,
it
would
be
legitimate
to
apply
the
ordinance
to
that.
justice
o'connor
so
how
do
you
distinguish
lewis?
justice
o'connor
so
what's
the
action?
so,
in
your
view,
it
only
applies
to
speech?
justice
o'connor
well
didn't
the
ordinance--
--it
would
be
conduct?
--in
the
lewis
case,
wasn't
it
directed
only
to
obscene
or
opprobrious
language
with
reference
to
the
police
while
in
the
actual
performance
of
their
duty?
isn't
that
what
the
statute
or
ordinance
in
lewis
involved?
justice
o'connor
at
the
police.
directed
at
the
police--
justice
o'connor
--in
the
performance
of
their
duty.
and
the
court
said
that's
invalid.
now
what
do
you
have
left
here
that
isn't
covered
by
lewis?
justice
o'connor
well
are
you
now
saying
that
it
could
not
apply
then
to
interruption
by
speech?
justice
o'connor
you
think
it
could
apply
to
the
speech,
the
interrupt?
justice
o'connor
and
how
do
you
distinguish
lewis?
justice
o'connor
well,
we
could
test
out
the
certification
procedure,
i
guess.
