mr.
lee,
are
you...
are
your
clients
complaining
only
about
parcels
as
to
which
they
have
acquired
the
support
estate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
nothing
else
is
at
issue
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
as
to
such
parcels,
do
you
think
that
under
the
regulatory
power
of
government,
that
there's
any
leeway
for
the
state
of
pennsylvania
to
prevent
and
prohibit
the
taking
of
any
portion
of
the
coal
to
prevent
contamination
of
water,
underground
water,
or
to
prevent
destruction
of
utility
lines?
is
that
beyond
the
regulatory
power
of
the
state?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
it
was
part
of
it.
i
thought
this
act
dealt
in
part
with
underground
water
aquifers
and
utility
lines.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
applying
that
to
protection
of
aquifers
and
utility
lines:
what
is
your
view?
i'm
not
clear.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
as
i
understand
it,
the
state
requires
only
a
small
percentage
of
the
coal
to
be
left
in
place,
from
one
to
nine
percent?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
record
really
tell
us
how
much
has
to
be
left
in
place?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
therefore,
is
this
right
for
our
decision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
acquired
the
support
rights.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
a
support
estate
in
every
piece
of
the
land
affected
by
this
that
you're
bringing
before
us?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
lee,
what
if
the
state
here
had
simply
passed
a
law
allowing
owners
of
the
surface
estate
to
compel
your
clients
to
convey
to
them
for
a
fair
price
the
support
structure
estate.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
as
much
as
50
percent
under
a
particular
structure?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
gordon,
the
pennsylvania
statute
deals
in
part
with
taking
support
estate
rights
under
publicly
owned
buildings,
does
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
doesn't
that
fall
just
squarely
within
one
of
the
concerns
if
pennsylvania
coal,
where
the
state
takes
land
or
an
interest
in
land
for
its
own
use?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
to
that
extent,
it's
awfully
hard
for
me,
anyway,
to
distinguish
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
gordon,
wouldn't
it
be
more
fair
in
your
view
for
pennsylvania
to
tell
the
coal
companies
that
they
would
have
to
sell
back
the
support
estate
to
a
surface
owner
if
there
were
a
structure
on
it
that
required
protection?
isn't
that
a
fair
way
to
approach
the
problem?
