mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
as
mr.
lee
mentioned,
this
appeal
raises
questions
under
the
takings
clause
and
the
contract
clause.
i'd
like
to
address
my
remarks
this
morning
primarily
to
the
taking
clause
issue.
if
my
time
permits,
or
if
the
court
has
questions,
i'll
address
the
contract
clause
issue
as
well.
the
coal
companies,
it
seems
to
me,
have
conceded
a
great
deal
in
this
case.
first
of
all,
they
do
not
contest
the
fact
that
pennsylvania's
subsidence
program
is
a
land
conservation
measure;
that
it
is
designed
to
promote
land
development,
to
protect
the
municipal
tax
base,
and
generally,
to
preserve
the
health,
safety
and
welfare
of
the
commonwealth
citizens.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
it
certainly
has
a
far
broader
focus.
it
is
intended
to
accomplish
a
great
deal.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
difference
in
itself,
and
we
don't
argue
that
that
difference
in
itself,
makes
the
case
distinguishable
from
pennsylvania
coal.
there
are
other
factors
which
i
will
elaborate
on
in
a
few
moments.
the
coal
companies
do
not
contest
the
fact,
as
well,
that
this
program
accomplishes
these
broad
purposes.
the
coal
companies
admit
that
the
government
may
regulate
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
property,
even
though
the
regulation
in
particular
cases
may
affect
property
values
adversely,
and
sometimes
substantially.
they
admit
as
well
that
the
effect
of
these
regulations
on
their
coal
mining
operations
is
relatively
small.
as
the
court
noted
in
the
chart
we
that
we
have
prepared
as
part
of
the
joint
appendix,
as
little
as
four-hundreths
of
one
percent
of
a
coal
mine
is
involved
in
this
particular
case.
and
the
percentage
varies.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
it
goes
up
to
nine
percent,
that's
correct.
and
of
course,
focussing
more
broadly--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--that's
right,
that's
correct.
focussing
even
more
broadly
than
that,
the
contracts
and
the
arrangements
that
are
involved
that
make
up
these
coal
mines,
that
these
coal
companies
purchase,
involve
more
than
the
purchase
of
coal.
they
purchase
many
other
rights
along
with
it.
they're
outlined
in
the
deeds
that
are
in
the
record.
but
many
rights:
the
right
to
sink
shafts,
to
erect
buildings
on
the
surface;
a
whole
variety
of
other
rights
were
purchased
along
with
the
coal.
so
we're
talking
about
a
small
aspect,
really,
as
far
as
this
record
shows,
of
what
they
have
and
what
they
control.
and
finally,
the
companies
do
not
contest
the
fact
that
since
this
program
was
initiated
back
in
1966,
that
they
have
operated
their
mines,
they
have
operated
them
at
a
profit.
and
in
fact,
as
recently
as
1980
and
'81,
in
the
face
of
these
regulatory
requirements,
and
federal
regulatory
requirements,
which
are
to
some
extent
similar,
consolidation
coal
company,
one
of
the
petitioners
here,
purchased
vast
new
mining
properties;
began
to
plan
a
new
complex
of
mines--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--if
they
went...
if
the
mined
the
coal--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--well,
obviously,
as
i
will
elaborate
on
more
in
the
rest
of
my
argument,
the
character
of
the
government
action
makes
a
difference.
and
certainly
that
would
make
a--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--well,
but
the
question
here,
of
course,
is:
is
there
a
taking.
and
what
that...
and
what--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--it
does
in
the...
when
you're
talking
about
a
regulatory
taking
that
affects
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
property,
it
makes
a
big
difference
what
the
economic
impact
and
the
relative
impact
is.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
if
pennsylvania
coal
establishes
that
there
is
a
taking
here,
then
obviously,
we
don't
prevail.
but
what
our
argument
is
that
you
can't
read
it
that
simply;
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
question
of
regulatory
takings
in
its
proper
perspective.
through
the
years
in
the
court's...
sometimes
its
struggle
to
come
up
with
guidelines
to
judge
takings
clause
claims--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--we
might
have
a
slight
difference
on
the
amount.
but
as
i
read
the
charts
in
the
appendix,
it's
upwards
of--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--yes,
somewhere
in
that
amount.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
my
understanding
is,
like
most
industries
which
are
capital
intensive
like
the
coal
industry
is,
it's
becoming
more
and
more
large
companies.
it's
possible;
i
don't
know.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
i
don't
know.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
it
could
be.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
i'm
not
sure...
would
be
no
compensation?
owner
all
of
the
economically
viable
use,
or
almost
all
taking.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
am
able
to
say
that
90
percent,
95
percent,
98
percent,
where
that
line
is;
and
i
don't
think
the
court
has
ever
said
where
that
line
is.
there
are
cases,
though,
that
certainly
have
found
no
taking
where
there
was
a
diminution
of
upwards
of
90
percent.
so
i'm
not
sure
where
that
line
is.
but
it's
possible,
as
applied
to
a
particular
coal
mine
and
a
particular
miner,
that
there
could
be
a
taking.
we
don't
dispute
that.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
i'm
not
sure
that
we
ascribe
the
features
to
it
that
the
petitioners
do.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
my
understanding
of
the
effect
of
the
support
estate,
or
a
waiver
of
liability,
whether
it's
in
pennsylvania
or
in
most
coal
mining
states
is,
it's
pretty
much
the
same.
what
it
is,
is
a
waiver
of
liability
for
damages
caused
by
coal
mining
to
the
surface.
or
if
it's
owned
by
the
surface
owner,
it's
a
protection
against
damage,
and
a
right
to
be
compensated
irrespective
of
fault.
what
happened
in
pennsylvania
was--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--well,
i
don't
know
that
it
would
eliminate
the
takings
argument
entirely,
really,
for
two
reasons.
one
is,
they
are
claiming
not
so
much
that
we
are
taking
their
support
right,
but
we're
taking
their
coal.
they
can't
take
the
coal
out,
so
we've
taken
it.
that's
point
one.
point
two
is,
of
course
a
contract
right
can
be
the
subject
of
a
takings
claim
as
well.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
they're
really
saying
both.
as
i
read
their
main
brief,
what
they
say
is:
we
have
to
leave
our
coal
in
the
ground.
we
can't
use
it.
you're
taking
it.
we
bought
the
support
right.
we
can't
get
the
benefit
of
it.
so
you're
taking
it.
i
read
their
reply
brief,
and
i
don't
really
the
support
estate
talked
about
very
much
at
all;
they're
concentrating
on
the
coal.
so
i
think
it's
a
little
bit
of
both.
but
our
argument
really
doesn't
change
based
upon
the
focus.
because
the
focus
is,
in
a
case
like
this,
on
the
overall
economic
impact.
this
is
not
a
case
that
falls
into
one
of
the
areas
where
the
court
has
seen
fit
to
adopt
a
per
se
rule.
this
is
not
a
case
like
a
physical
appropriate
case,
or
a
physical
invasion
case,
where
in
almost
every
instance,
regulation
will
be
found
to
be
a
taking.
in
the
absence
of
invasion
or
appropriation,
the
court's
approach
has
been
less
structured
and,
frankly,
more
lenient
towards
regulation.
and
there
are
good
reasons
for
this.
the
police
power
on
which
regulatory
actions
like
this
one
is
based...
are
based...
is
an
essential
component
of
an
organized
society.
and
this
power,
as
this
court
has
recognized
time
and
again,
can't
be
overly
restrained
without
doing
damage
to
the
state's
and
the
government's
ability
to
protect
the
citizens.
in
theory,
of
course,
compensation
could
be
paid
every
time
regulation
diminished
property
values
at
all.
but
the
court
has
recognized
in
many
cases
that
this
is
an
unworkable
solution.
and
frankly,
property
and
all
property
values
are
not
entirely
sacrosanct.
to
a
degree,
they
may
be
limited.
they
may
be
regulated.
sometimes
in
return
for...
really,
for
nothing
more
than
the
owner's
right
to
live
and
do
business
in
an
organized
society.
police
power
regulation
of
this
sort
is
especially
important
in
the
area
of
land
use,
which
is
what
we
are
dealing
with
here.
the
zoning
cases
have
recognized
through
the
years
that
land
use
is
interdependent;
that
my
use
of
my
land
has
spillover
effects
beyond
the
borders
of
my
property,
in
fact,
beyond
the
borders
of
my
neighbor's
property
as
well.
in
order
to
deal
with
this
competition
between,
on
the
one
hand,
the
right
of
property
owners
to
use
and
enjoy
their
property,
and
on
the
other
hand,
the
government's
need
to
regulate
the
use
and
enjoyment
of
property
in
the
spillover
effects,
to
deal
with
this
competition
the
court
has
adopted
the
practice
of
looking
broadly
at
what
an
owner
has,
and
assessing
against
that
baseline
the
overall
effect
of
regulation
on
the
owner's
economic
interest.
and
this
has
been
an
evolutionary
process.
pennsylvania
coal
was
the
first
step.
in
that
case,
the
court
made
the
general
statement
that
regulation,
if
it
goes
too
far,
can
amount
to
a
taking.
this
was
carried
forward
in
the
later
cases,
particularly
goldblatt,
penn
central,
and
hodel.
and
what
these
later
cases
make
abundantly
clear
is
that
the
effect
of
regulation
must
be
judged
against
the
entire
package
of
rights
which
the
owner
controls;
not
by
isolating
a
particular
segment
which
may
be
most
clearly
affected
by
the
regulation,
and
just
looking
at
the
effect
on
that
segment.
to
do
otherwise,
quite
simply,
is
unrealistic.
property
is
not
purchased,
it
is
not
valued
or
viewed
in
legally
discrete
components.
it
is
purchased
and
acquired
and
viewed
in
legally
recognized
bundles.
so
in
this
case
we
have
coal
companies
who
operate
coal
mines.
they
operate
them
as
economic
units.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
no,
we
certainly
don't
say
that.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
our
argument
goes
that
you
take
a
look
at
what
the
owner
has.
you
take
a--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--the
value
is
the
coal
mine,
an
operating,
a
profitable
coal
mine.
that
is--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--that
is
the
economic
unit
under
which
coal
miners
operate.
it
is
the
way
we
all...
we,
being
the
regulators
as
well
as
the
industry...
views
what
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
i
think
in
each
case
you
have
to
take
a
look
at
the
overall
regulatory
scheme,
at
the
complete
package
of
property
rights
which
the
owner
controls,
and
assess
the
economic
impact
of
that
regulation.
and
if,
for
example...
in
your
example,
the
result
would
be,
ultimately,
that
there
would
be
a
taking,
then
the
state,
i
suppose,
would
be
put
to
the
choice
of
deciding
whether
it
wanted
to
go
that
far.
and
if
it
did,
it
would
have
to
pay
compensation.
if
it
wanted
to
go
to
the
point
where
it
denied
the
owner
economically
valuable
use
of
his
property,
then
it
would
have
to
pay
compensation.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
absolutely.
and
under
the
case
law,
for
example,
the
regulation...
i
believe
they
could
be
categorized
as
zoning
cases...
but
the
regulation
of
the
brickyard,
or
the
regulation
of
the
sand
and
gravel
quarry,
took
away
a
substantial
use;
no
doubt
the
best
use,
the
most
profitable
use,
of
that
property,
and
was
nevertheless
not
found
by
the
court
to
be
a
taking
because--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--yes.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
yes.
all
states
do,
as
far
as
i
know.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
it
does.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
let
me
say
this--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--what
pennsylvania
law
says
is,
that
there
is
a
support
right.
you
have
it
if
you
own
the
surface,
and
you
can
waive
it.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
okay.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
that
is
correct.
out
of
many
millions,
i
think
billions
of
tons,
as
the
record
reflects,
which
lie
in
these
coal
mines.
it
is
really
no
different
than
if
you
say,
well,
we
have
a
building
setback
ordinance.
and
you
can't
really
use
certain
portions
of
your
parcel.
now,
maybe
you
can't
use
the
full
air
rights
that
you
have.
you
can't
build
as
high
as
you
want.
if
you're
still
permitted
economically
viable
use
of
that
property,
it's
not
a
taking.
and
the
same
rationale
applies
here.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
yes,
you
are
bound
to
respect
state
law
with
respect
to
the
definition
of
property.
no,
the
totality
of
that
right
has
not
been
taken
here,
and
let
me
tell
you
why.
both
courts
below
recognized,
in
taking
a
look
at
pennsylvania
law,
and
a
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case,
a
couple
of
very
important
points.
first
of
all,
the
support
right,
the
support
estate,
it
may
have
been
given
the
label
of
an
estate
in
land;
and
we
don't
dispute
that.
but
it
has
no
value,
it
has
no
economic
value,
separate
and
apart
from
other
property
interests.
that's
the
first
part.
it
has
to
be
combined
with
the
surface
right,
it
has
to
be
combined
with
the
mineral
rights,
to
have
any
value.
second
point,
what
we
have
here--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--i
think
that's
precisely
our
point.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
let's
take
your
example,
the
right
to
cultivate.
what
if
we
say,
here
is
land,
we'll
assume
it's
a
good
public
purpose,
you
can't
have
a
farm
there,
because
of
erosion
problems
or
whatever.
you
can
do
whatever
else
you
want
with
it.
you
can
build
an
apartment
building.
the
judgment
is,
well,
that's
certainly
an
economically
viable
use
of
that
land.
and
the
result
is,
no
taking.
that's
exactly
right.
it's
consistent
with
our
position.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
that
gets
me
to
point
two,
which
is,
if
you
look
at
the
record
in
this
case,
we
haven't
completely
destroyed
the
support
right.
even
if
you
isolate
it
away
from
the
coal,
all
the
other
interests
that
were
purchased
as
a
part
of
this
single
contract
of
which
the
support
estate
is
a
part.
because
what
we've
said
is,
here
you
have
a
limited
class
of
structures,
and
certain
environmental
features.
and
under
those
particular
features
and
structures,
we
don't
want
you
to
mine
coal
because
of
subsidence.
the
rest
of
your
mines,
the
other
thousands
and
thousands
of
acres,
covered
by
this
same
transaction,
the
same
support
right
that
you
purchased
from
the
surface
owner,
you
can
use
that.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
again,
the
question
is,
if
we
are
restricting
your
use...
the
use
of
your
land,
that'll
get
back
to
my
example
with
the
setback
regulations
or
the
height
restrictions.
we
certainly
restricted
the
property
owner's
use
of
a
portion
of
his
parcel,
or
maybe
a
separate
property
right,
like
air
rights.
and
nevertheless--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--well,
justice
white
was
asking
mr.
lee
a
little
bit
about
the
support
estate
and
how
it
came
about
and
what
does
it
all
mean,
and
maybe
this
will
help
a
little
bit.
there's
a
law
review
article
which
is
cited
in
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
at
page
15a
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition.
and
that
article
is
a
fairly
comprehensive
review
of
the
case
law
having
to
do
with
the
support
estate
and
how
this
concept
came
about.
and
it
didn't
come
about
because
coal
mining
is
such
an
important
industry
to
pennsylvania,
although
obviously,
it
is.
it
came
about
because
of
some
rather
strange
conveyancing
problems
that
arose
in
a
couple
of
isolated
transactions
where
you
had,
in
one
situation,
the
surface
conveyed
without
the
right
to
support,
and
then
the
coal
conveyed
without
a
waiver
as
well...
without
a
conveyance
of
the
support
estate.
and
you
had
a
situation
where
subsidence
occurred.
and
here
comes
the
case.
and
the
owner
of
the
surface
says,
you
didn't
have
a
waiver,
you
have
to
repair
it.
and
the
court
said,
well,
no,
you
didn't
own
the
surface
either.
the
coal
miner
didn't
own
it.
but
you
didn't
own
it
either.
so
you
can't
enforce
that.
it
didn't
come
about
because
of
some
overwhelming
need
to
have
this
concept
for
the
purpose
of
advancing
coal
mining
or
the
interests
of
coal
mining.
it
arose
in
a
rather
strange
set
of
circumstances.
and
that's
really
where
it's
remained.
there
hasn't
been
anything
since
those
cases
at
the
turn
of
the
century
that
have
really
amplified
it.
and
as
both
courts
below
found,
after
examining
state
law,
and
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
really
does
not
make
sense,
realistically,
without...
without
in
any
way
tampering
with
pennsylvania
law
and
the
definition
of
this
property
interest,
to
view
it
in
isolation.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
i
take
it
in
your
hypothetical
you
mean
to
restrict
the
use
of
it
as
opposed
to
physically
occupying
it.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
it
is
our
view,
based
on
the
state
law,
that
if
the
state
takes
and
occupies
any
of
your
land,
however
small,
that
that
is
a
taking
under
loretto.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
that's
an
important
factor;
it
is.
now,
in
the
face
of
these
developments
which
i
mentioned
a
few
minutes
ago,
namely,
the
principle
that
you
look
at
the
entire
package--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--we're
making
one
of
the
arguments
that
he
made
in
dissent.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
i
will
assume
it
was
rejected
since
it
wasn't
accepted
and
he
mentioned
it
in
his
dissent.
the
court
didn't
say
anything
about
it.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
i
think
that's
a
fair
inference.
but
let
me
say
this--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--the
state
would
have
to
pay
for
the
same
reason
that
payment
was
required
in
loretto,
because
no
matter
how
small
the
area
that's
involved,
when
there
is
an
authorization
for
a
physical
invasion,
that
is
a
different
case.
that
is
a
special
case
that
involves
essentially...
at
least
in
most
cases,
with
the
exception
of
a
case
like
prune
yard,
for
example...
of
a
per
se
rule.
but
that's
not
this
case.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
that's
right.
a
more
sophisticated
inquiry
is
required.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
it
is
value.
although
i
would
say
that
in
the
record,
there
were
allegations
in
affidavits
in
support
of
the
summary
judgment
motion
that
the
coal
in
the
ground
was
valueless,
and
we
didn't
directly
dispute
that.
so
we
are
assuming
for
at
least
the
purposes--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--no,
i'm
not.
it's
certainly
valuable
to
the
owner.
and
it's
valuable
to
the
community
generally,
as
is
reflected
in
the
statute.
i
was
just
pointing
out
that
the
specific
allegation
was
that
it
was
valueless
as
coal.
you're
right;
it's
value
in
support.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
that's
right.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
yes,
public
buildings
are
one
of
the
categories.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
it
was
one
of
the
concerns
expressed
in
the
pennsylvania
coal
opinion.
what
you
have
to
do
here,
i
think,
is
to
not
abstract
one
small
feature
of
this
regulatory
program,
and
look
at
it
in--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--well,
let
me
say
this
about
the
comment
earlier
about
justice
brandeis'
dissent.
interestingly
enough,
this
idea
that
you
look
at
the
whole
package
seemingly
had
its
source
in
justice
brandeis'
dissent.
it
wasn't
cited
in
the
later
cases,
but
it
seems
remarkably
close.
and
really
it
is
this
principle,
and
this
principle
alone,
it
seems
to
me,
that
explains
the
more
recent
results
in
cases
such
as
goldblatt
and
penn
central.
there...
pennsylvania
coal,
quite
frankly,
if
it
ever...
if
it
ever
did,
no
longer
stands
for
the
proposition
that
an
owner
has
a
constitutionally
protected
right
in
the
full
use
of
every
segment
of
his
property.
that
is
the
development
since
pennsylvania
coal,
and
that's
what
commands
the
result
that
we
urge
here.
i
think
we
lose
sight
of
the
fact
that
what
we
are
talking
about...
or
we
risk
losing
sight
of
the
fact
that
what
we
are
talking
about
in
a
case
like
this
is
the
regulation
of
business
and
the
use
of
this
property
in
the
operation
of
a
business.
and
of
course
the
primary...
the
primary
concern
of
businessmen
are
profits.
and
yet
all
that
they've
shown
here,
all
that
the
coal
companies
have
shown
here,
is
that
they
have
lost
the
opportunity
to
sell
at
a
profit
some
small
portion
of
their
coal.
yet
the
curtailment
of
maximum
profit
opportunities
never
has
been
viewed
by
the
court,
nor
should
it,
as
standing
alone,
a
basis
on
which
to
rest
a
takings
claim.
the
court
has
endeavored
through
the
years
to
apply
what
it
has
termed
rules
of
judgment,
common
sense,
and
fairness.
the
hypertechnical
distinctions,
it
seems
to
me,
which
the
coal
companies
ask
the
court
to
draw
here,
namely
that,
well,
in
a
case
like
penn
central,
for
example,
or
goldblatt,
you
can't
draw
lines
between
the
air
rights,
the
surface
rights,
the
subsurface
rights,
and
just
look
at
the
effect
on
one
of
those
segments.
but
in
a
case
such
as
this,
what
they
would
like
the
court
to
do
is
draw
the
lines
at
the
boundaries
of
this
protected
building;
take
a
look
at
the
coal
under
there;
and
just
assess
the
effect
on
that
segment
of
their
property.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
of
course,
the
way
this
program
is
set
up,
we've
done
that
to
a
certain
extent.
with
respect
to
some
structures,
that
really
is
the
only
right
that's
available.
but
frankly
the
concern
here,
although
there
was
concern
with
the
people
who
lived
above
these
mines,
it's
a
far
broader
concern.
it's
a
community-wide
concern
in...
for
the
interests
of
land
development,
for
the
preservation
of
the
tax
base.
and
that's
what
makes
it
fair,
in
our
view.
that,
combined
with
really
the
minimal
effect.
not
only
is
there--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--yes,
in
1980
the
statute
was
amended
to
provide
for
a
waiver
under
limited
circumstances.
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
well,
except
there
are
two
reasons
why
it
doesn't
go
quite
that
far.
first
of
all,
let
me
say
that
in
experience
the
waiver
provision
is
not
something
that's
widely
used.
and
in
fact
the
protections
of
the
act
have
been
widespread.
but
second
of
all,
if
you
a
look--
mr.
andrew
s.
gordon
--i
think
you
need
to
also
note,
with
respect
to
the
waiver
provision,
that
it
only
applies
if
the
miner
has
the
consent
of
the
present
owner.
and
what
that
means
is,
if
the
miner
gets
consent,
and
for
some
reason
the
land
is
sold,
the
consent
isn't
binding
on
the
successor.
the
point
is
this--
