justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--does
any
other
state
have
a
law
like
pennsylvania?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
say
it's
unique?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
general,
before
you
move
on,
do
you
agree
with
mr.
lee
that
perhaps
up
to,
what,
30
million
tons
of
coal
will
have
to
be
left
in
the
ground
with
no
economic
value
under
this
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
could
be
27
to
30?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
is
it
possible
that
that
could
be...
i
don't
know
too
much
about
the
particular
petitioners
here...
but
is
it
possible
that
there
could
be
a
very
small
owner
of
coal
that
substantially
all
of
which
could
be
taken
under
this
act?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
i
would
agree
with
that.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
let's
assume,
for
example,
you
own
a
hundred
or
a
thousand
acres,
and
you
leased
it
to
a
coal
company.
and
it
so
happened
that
because
of
the
effect
of
this
act,
you
had
a
lease
depending
upon
the
percentage
of
the
coal
drawn
from
the
ground.
if
you
just
happened
to
have
it
where
the
act
was
applied,
you'd
lose
90
percent
of
your
rent.
would
that
be
a
taking?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
it
would
be,
wouldn't
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
gordon,
over
here.
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you
when
you
were
just
going
to
start
on
another
subject.
but
i'd
like
to
follow
up
on
the
chief
justice's
question.
let's
assume
that
you
owned
a
profitable
farm.
and
it
was
necessary
in
the
interests
of
public
safety
for
a
highway
that
adjoined
your
farm
to
be
substantially
widened,
to
take
a
substantial...
well,
to
take
a
fraction
of
your
property.
you
draw
the
distinction
between
regulation
and
taking.
there
you
would
have
the
interests
of
the
state
in
public
safety.
would
the
state
not
have
to
pay
for
whatever
part
of
your
property
it
took,
even
though
the
property
remained
economically
viable,
and
even
though
the
state
had
a
legitimate
public
interest?
would
the
state
have
to
pay
or
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
here
there's
no
taking
because
the
coal
remains
in
the
ground,
even
though
it
has
no
value?
