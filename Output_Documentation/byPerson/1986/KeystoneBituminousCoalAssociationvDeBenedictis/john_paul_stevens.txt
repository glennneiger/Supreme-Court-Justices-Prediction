let
me
just
follow
up
on
that
for
a
second.
supposing
you
have
a
house
on
a
big
farm.
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
you're
saying
is,
50
percent
of
the
coal
under
the
house
has
to
be
retained.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
rest
of
it
on
the
farm
wouldn't.
and
you're
mainly
concerned
about
mining
under
urban
areas,
is
that
what
the
problem
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
just
the
structures
out
in
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
well,
but
if
you're
just
concerned
about
50
percent
of,
say,
a
40-foot
square
parcel
in
a
20-acre
farm,
it
doesn't
sound...
50
percent
is
a
little
bit
misleading,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
the
record
tell
us
what
proportion
of
the
given
coal
fields
have
structures
on
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
does
the
50
percent
reduce
to
in
terms
of
the
total
field,
in
other
words?
justice
john
paul
stevens
except
insofar
as
the
exhibit
on
page
284
indicates
it's
about
nine
percent.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lee,
how
much
of
that
do
you
think
you
have
a
constitutional
right
to
remove?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
have
a
right
to
remove
all
of
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--it
is
correct,
is
it
not,
that
your...
that
pennsylvania
law
differs
from,
say,
west
virginia,
indiana,
and
illinois
with
regard
to
this
underground
support
estate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
so
that
your...
there
at
least
would
be
a
different
takings
argument
in
the
rest
of
the
country,
basically?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
one
other
question
about
the
three
estates?
does
the
record
give
us
any
indication
of
the
relative
costs
of
the
three...
just
of
the
two
estates?
how
much
extra
for
underground
coal
do
they
have
to
pay
to
get
the
support
as
well?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
gordon--
--do
you
concede
that
the
coal
has
no
value
when
it's
in
the
ground?
doesn't
it
perform
the
function
of
supporting
the
surface,
and
isn't
that
value?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
assuming
that
the
support
estate,
even
when
owned
by
the
owner,
is
totally
valueless?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
valueless
as
part
of
the
mineral
estate.
but
the
mineral
estate
is
something
else.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
lee,
doesn't
that
cut
against
you,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
that
demonstrate...
cut
against
you?
because
doesn't
that
demonstrate
that
the
coal
in
place
has
economic
value
apart
from
being
mined
and
taken
out
of
there?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
support
estate,
as
i
understand,
to
be
a
bunch
of
pillars
of
coal
or
solid
coal
underground.
there
is
some
value
in
not
having
the
surface
collapse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
suppose
if
you
didn't
have
a
waiver
of
surface
subsidence,
it
would
also
protect
you
against
liability.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
suppose
that
instead
of
going
about
it
the
way
they
did,
pennsylvania
had
passed
a
statute
saying:
when
you
remove
all
of
the
pillars
underground,
they
must
be
replaced
with
steel
structures.
would
that
be
constitutional?
it'd
be
a
lot
more
expensive,
i
know.
