mr.
rex
e.
lee
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
two
constitutional
provisions,
the
takings
clause
and
the
contract
clause.
the
principle
that
controls
the
takings
issue
is
simple
and
well
established.
sixty-four
years
ago
this
court
held
in
pennsylvania
coal
v.
mahon
that
regulation
which
goes
too
far
amounts
to
an
unconstitutional
taking.
and
specifically,
it
held
that
the
state
of
pennsylvania
went
too
far
when
it
required
anthracite
coal
owners
to
leave
certain
coal
in
the
ground
in
order
to
serve
a
public
purpose.
there
is,
very
simply,
no
meaningful
distinction
between
section
4,
which
is
one
of
the
two
sections
of
the
statute
at
issue
today,
and
the
kohler
act,
which
held...
which
pennsylvania
coal
held
unconstitutional.
indeed,
the
parallels
between
the
two
statutes
are
remarkable.
the
operative
language
in
the
kohler
act
was
as
follows:
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
owner
so
to
mine
anthracite
coal
as
to
cause
subsidence.
whereas
its
modern
day
counterpart,
section
4,
states
that
no
owner
shall
mine
bituminous
coal
so
as
to
cause
damage
from
subsidence.
the
one
deals
with
anthracite,
and
the
other,
bituminous.
but
that's
the
only
real
difference.
if
pennsylvania
coal
is
still
good
law,
as
this
court
has
stated
on
many
occasions
that
it
is,
the
then
third
circuit's
judgment
in
this
case
must
be
reversed.
the
controversy
arises
out
of
the
following
circumstances.
pennsylvania
law
recognizes
three
separate
property
interests,
or
estates
in
land:
the
mineral
estate;
the
surface
estate;
and
the
support
estate.
my
clients'
constitutional
rights
are
based
on
the
right
that
as
to
most
of
their
properties,
they
have
acquired
two
of
these
three
estates.
and
it's
important
to
understand
why
it
is
that
they
acquired
the
support
estate
in
addition
to
the
coal.
most
of
pennsylvania's
bituminous
coal,
which
is
located
in
the
western
part
of
the
state,
lies
hundreds
of
feet
below
the
ground
and
is
extracted
by
underground
mining.
when
that
happens,
the
surface
will
subside.
in
some
cases,
the
subsidence
will
cause
damage,
and
in
other
cases,
it
doesn't.
and
it
is
impossible
to
predict
in
advance
which
parcels
will
be
damaged
by
subsidence,
and
which
will
not.
two
facts,
then,
bring
the
interests
of
the
coal
owners
on
the
one
hand
and
the
surface
owners
on
the
other
into
an
obvious
conflict.
on
the
one
hand,
coal
in
the
ground
has
no
value
unless
it
can
be
mined.
it's
worthless
unless
it
can
be
mined.
yet
on
the
other
hand,
the
underground
mining
of
any
coal
in
any
quantity
creates
some
risk
of
subsidence.
so
that
if
it
isn't
mined,
it's
valueless.
and
if
it
is
mined,
there
will
be
subsidence,
and
there
may
be
some
damage.
in
the
case
of
about
90
percent
of
the
bituminous
parcels
in
pennsylvania,
these
competing
interests
have
been
accommodated,
and
the
relevant
burdens
and
risks
have
been
shifted
by
contract.
between
about--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
the
coal
owners--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--those
are...
i
think
it
is
not
totally
beyond
the
regulatory
power
of
the
state,
justice
o'connor.
i
want
to
stress
at
the
outset
that
that's
outside
what
we're
talking
about
in
this
instance.
but--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
insofar
as...
and
let
me
draw
the
distinction.
in
the
pennsylvania
coal
case,
there
was
a
case
that
the
majority...
that
the
court
distinguished.
it
was
called
the
plymouth
coal
case,
which
dealt
with
the
requirements
for
mine
safety.
i
think
that
when
the
coal
miners
engage
in
a
certain
kind
of
activity,
then
the
state
has
the
right
to
regulate
that
activity
in
such
a
way
as
to
make
it
safe.
but
when
they
go
beyond
that,
and
attempt
to
take
property
in
such
a
way
as
to...
as
to
protect
other
property,
then
that's
the
point
at
which
it
goes
too
far.
and
that,
we
submit,
is
the
necessary
holding
of
pennsylvania
coal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
our
view
is...
now,
of
course,
aquifers
and
utility
lines
is
different
factually
from
what
happened
in
pennsylvania
coal.
but
we
don't
think
that
it's
a
different...
there's
a
difference
in
concept,
and
we
don't
think
that
the
legal
rule
is
different
insofar
as
aquifers
and
utility
are
concerned.
it's
not
private
property;
public
property
in
a
sense.
but
it
involves
the
same
principle,
that
if
pennsylvania
wants
to
accomplish
its
purposes...
and
certainly
those
are
proper
purposes...
that
there
comes
a
point
at
which
regulation
goes
too
far,
if
it
takes
too
much,
if
it
regulates
too
much,
then
it
goes
too
far.
and
the
necessary
holding
of
pennsylvania
coal
is
that
when
coal
has
only
one
value,
unlike
the
situation
in
penn
central,
where
there
were
other
values,
and
unlike
all
of
the
other
cases,
when
it
only
has
one
value,
then
if
pennsylvania
eliminates
that
value,
it
has
gone
too
far.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
that
is
not
correct.
let
me
clarify
the
answer
to
that.
and
let
me
compare
it
in
that
respect,
to
the
kohler
act.
note
the
parallels
in
the
language.
both
simply
said
you
can't...
you
can't
mine
anthracite
or
bituminous
in
such
a
way
as
to
cause
subsidence.
neither
statute
said
you
have
to
leave
so
much
in
the
ground.
it
was
assumed
however
in
the
pennsylvania
coal
case
that
the
amount
that
would
be
required
to
be
left
in
the
ground
was
about
a
third.
and
that's
in
the
opinion,
mostly
in
the
argument
portion
of
the
opinion,
in
pennsylvania
coal.
in
the
case
of
the
modern
day
counterpart
to
the
kohler
act,
in
the
case
of
section
4,
the
state
of
pennsylvania
in
1982
adopted
regulations
which
require
that
50
percent
of
the
coal
underlying
certain
designated
surface
structures
be
left
in
the
ground.
now,
the
one
percent
to
nine
percent
that
they're
talking
about
is
the
percentage
of
the
coal
that
has
to
be
left
in
the
ground,
that
is,
the
50
percent
under
surface
structure;
the
percentage
that
that
is
to
the
total
coal
holdings
of
the
company.
but
they're
the
same.
the
only
difference
in
that
respect
is
that
where
it
was
assumed
in
pennsylvania...
and
apparently
correctly,
because
that's
what
the
lower
court
said
as
well...
was
that
you
had
to
leave
30
percent
of
the
anthracite.
we
are
required
to
leave
50
percent
of
the
bituminous.
so
that
these
contractual
arrangements
that
were
made
mostly
between
the
years
1890
and
1920,
carefully
shifting
the
burdens
between
the
parties,
among
the
parties
that
are
affected,
have
been
rearranged
by
the
state
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
it
is
indeed
right.
the
state
of
pennsylvania's
own
exhibit,
which
appears,
justice
o'connor,
at
page
284
of
the
joint
appendix,
shows
in
excess
of
26
million
tons
that
have
been
left.
part
of
the
record,
though
it
hasn't
been
sent
here
to
the
clerk's
office,
are
maps
that
show
exactly
where
those
parcels
are;
where
they
are
in
the
mining
plans;
and
which
parts
are
going
to
have
to
be...
and
which
parts
are
going
to
have
to
be
left.
this
cases
contrasts,
in
that
respect,
with
other
cases
in
which
in
recent
years
the
court
has
not
reached
the
takings
issue
in
land
use
cases
because
of
ripeness
problems.
and
i'd
like
to
contrast
in
that
respect
with
yolo
county.
in
yolo
county
the
court
had
to--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
the
coal
underlying
the
particular
structures
that
are
protected
by
section
4.
what
the
statute,
as
implemented
by
the
regulations,
requires
is
this:
you
have
a
designated
structure.
you
move
out
15
feet
from
each
side
of
that
structure.
and
then
you
go
down
at
an
angle
of
15
degrees
from
a
perpendicular
to
the
point
where
the
coal
seam
lies.
and
then
within
that
circumscribed
area,
you
have
to
leave
50
percent
of
the
coal
that
is
within
that
area.
it's
exactly
the
same
as
you
had
in
pennsylvania
coal.
and
the
amount
that
was
left
under
the
man's
home
in
pennsylvania
coal
was
an
even
smaller
percentage
of
the
total
pennsylvania
coal
holdings.
now,
let
me
just
complete--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
it
really
isn't.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
coal
reserves
in
this
area
just
aren't
in
urban
areas.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
would
that
that
were
the
case,
justice
stevens.
by
the
time--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--the
record
tells
us--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--what
the
record
tells
us...
it
doesn't
tell
us
what
it
reduces
to
in
terms
of
the
total
field.
but
it
does
tell
us
this--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
it's
about
nine...
that's
right,
it's
about
nine
percent
of
the
total
coal
fields.
but
a
couple
of
things
need
to
be
said.
would
that
it
were
only
40
feet
by
the
time
it
gets
down
to
the
seam.
by
the
time
you
extent
that
down
at
a
15
degree
angle
for
800
feet,
it
amounts
to
acres
by
the
time
you
actually
reach
the
point
where
the
coal
is.
but
the
important
thing
is
that
there
is
no
question
that
it
amounts
somewhere
between
their
figure
of
26
million
tons,
and
30
million
tons.
and
that
is
the
amount
that
is
have
to
be
left...
that
has
had
to
be
left
in
the
ground
underneath
these
structures
solely
because
of
this
statute.
and
it
is
indistinguishable,
for
those
purposes,
from
pennsylvania
coal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
all
of
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
that
is
the
thrust
of
pennsylvania
coal,
that...
because
from
1890
to
1920
we
acquired
those
rights.
the
question
is
who--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--support
estate.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
those
parcels
as
to
which
we
acquired
the
support
estate.
i
refer
you
back
to
my
earlier
comment
that
they're
in
irreconcilable
conflict
with
each
other.
the
coal
is
worthless
unless
you
can
mine
it.
on
the
other
hand,
if
you
do
mine
it,
there
is
going
to
be
subsidence,
and
in
some
instances,
there
will
be
damages.
now
the
way
that
that
is
accommodated
is,
that
someone
has
the
support
right.
which
can
only
be
used
valuably
in
connection
with
either
one
of
the
other
two
estates.
if
it
belongs
to
the
surface
owner,
then
you
can't
mine.
if
it
belongs
to
the
coal
owner,
then
you
can
mine.
and
what
pennsylvania
has
done
is
to
redistribute
these
property
rights
and
contract
rights
that
the
parties
have
acquired
as
between
themselves.
and
that
is
pennsylvania
coal.
now
coming
to
ripeness,
and
let
me
just
finish
it
up.
there
is
identifiable,
recognizable
coal
in
identifiable
amounts
that
has
been
left
under
the
ground
in
order
to
accomplish
a
public
purpose.
in
yolo
county,
the
court
properly
observed
that
it
had...
well,
let
me
say,
the
court
had
two
tasks.
it
had
to
determine,
first,
how
much
of
a
land...
how
much
land
use
regulation
amounted
to
a
taking;
that
had
never
been
determined.
and
then
it
had
to
determine
whether
the
particular...
particular
case
did
or
did
not
meet
that
measure.
but
as
the
court
said,
a
court
cannot
determine
whether
a
regulation
has
gone
too
far
unless
it
first
knows
how
far
the
regulation
goes.
there,
there
was
no
indication
whether
some
less
dense
development
was
possible,
and
therefore,
how
badly
the
surface
owners
had
been
hurt.
and
until
you
could
know
that,
you
could
not
know
whether
the
regulation
went
too
far.
here
it
has
been
established
how
far
is
too
far.
and
here
we
know
that
30
million
tons
of
identifiable
coal
have
been
left.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
wouldn't
have
any.
we
wouldn't
be
here.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
because
the
state
of
pennsylvania
then
wouldn't
be
taking
anything,
because
then
they
would
just
be
adjusting
something
that
the
parties
themselves
unadjusted.
i
supposed
there
might
be
an
argument.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it's
the
same
thing.
then
we
would
be
here,
because
that's--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--then
it
would
be
the
contract
clause.
then
i
would
be
talking
to
you
about
my
section
6
rather
than
section
4.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
pennsylvania
law.
there's
the
captline
case
that
you
might
want
to
look
at,
justice
white,
cited
in
our
brief.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
but
it
is
measured
by
the
value
of
the
25
million
tons.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
it
is,
because
the
support...
pennsylvania
is
unique
in
this
respects.
you
could
accomplish
the
same
thing
in
west
virginia
by
getting
the
waiver.
put
it
is
conceptually
cleaner--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
arguably
correct,
though
i
think--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
arguably.
arguably.
i
think
you
could
still
make
a
takings
argument
under
those
circumstance.
but
i
will
save
that
for
the
case
if
it
ever
comes
up.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it's
unique
in
that
respect.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
identical.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
statement
is
a
correct
one.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
really
doesn't,
justice
powell.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it's
unique.
pennsylvania...
oh,
excuse
me
pennsylvania
is
unique
both
in
recognizing
the
support
estate.
it
is
also
unique
in
that
it
is
the
only
state
that
has
ever
found
it
necessary
to
go
as
far
as
pennsylvania
has
gone
both
in
1921
and
then
almost
half
a
century
later
in
this
particular
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
captline?
it's
cited
in
our
brief,
and
i'm
sure
in
the
state's
as
well.
and
it
is
459
a.
2nd
1298.
on
the
merit--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
really
doesn't.
there
are
a
number
of
deeds,
and
i'm
told
that
you
can
reconstruct
from
the
information
on
the
deeds.
but
they
bought
the
whole
package,
as
a
single
package.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
get
your
question.
the
state
in
fact
did
that,
at
section
15
of
the
same
statute,
and
we're
not
challenging
it.
on
the
merits,
the
respondents
make
two
arguments.
the
first
is
an
attempt
to
distinguish
pennsylvania
coal,
and
the
second,
we
contend,
amounts
to
an
attempt
to
overrule
it.
we
are
told--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
of
course
not.
of
course
not.
but
it's
about...
it's
a
good
discussion
of
the
general
rule,
is
all
i'm
saying,
justice
white.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
it
has
both
common
law
and
ancient
statutory
roots.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
ancient...
ancient
for...
i
don't...
yes,
ancient
for
pennsylvania.
let
me
revise
that
statement.
it
has
both
common
law
and
long-standing
statutory
roots.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
i
think
there's
little
question
why
it
came
to
pass.
it's
because
pennsylvania
is
an
importing
coal
mining
state,
and
there
was
a
need
to
accommodate
these
obviously
competing
interests.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
really
not
sure,
but
i've
always
assumed
that
it
was
because
of
something
more
than
an
action
for
damages.
that
it
was,
whether
there
was
or
was
not
a
duty
to
support.
the
state
suggests
that
this
is
not
like
the
kohler
act,
and
they
suggest
only
one
difference.
and
that
difference
is
that,
whereas
the
kohler
act
was
designed
to
protect
personal
safety,
that
the
purpose
of
the
subsidence
act
is
to
promote
land
development
and
preserve
the
tax
basis.
that
argument
is
insufficient
for
two
reasons.
the
first
is
that
the
constitution
guarantees
against
takings
without
compensation.
it
does
not
permit
takings
without
compensation
for
some
purposes
but
not
others.
once
it's
determined
that
the
state
has
gone
too
far,
then
the
state
has
only
two
options:
they
either
stop
the
restriction
or
pay
for
the
property
taking.
it
makes
no
difference
in
a
particular
case
that
a
state
may
or
may
not
have
a
very
good
reason
for
taking.
if
the
reason
is
good
enough,
then
it
can
take.
but
if
it
takes
it
has
to
pay.
and
if
it
doesn't
pay,
then
it
must
stop
the
taking.
here
it
is
beyond
dispute
that
the
state
has
gone
too
far,
because
pennsylvania
coal
holds
that
requiring
coal
to
be
left
in
the
ground
is
a
taking.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
those
are
extensive.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
indeed
we
do.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mostly...
there
can
be
artificial
supports;
it's
a
combination
of
both.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
reason
that
they
don't...
let
me
give
you
a
twofold
answer.
the
first
is
just
a
precedent
answer,
that
that
really
is
the
plymouth
coal
case,
which
a
few
years
prior
to
pennsylvania
coal,
had
involved
the
requirement
that
coal
be
left
in
the
ground
for
support
purposes...
excuse
me,
for
safety
purposes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
for
safety
purposes.
and
this
court,
in
its
decision
in
pennsylvania
coal,
distinguished
that
case
on
two
grounds,
as
i
read
the
opinion.
one
is
that
it
was
related
to
a
purpose
that
is
attributable
to
what
the
mining
companies
themselves
were
doing,
that
if
they're
going
to
mine,
that
the
state
does
have
an
interest
in
controlling
that
activity.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
the
second
is,
that
it
was
only
temporary;
that
whereas...
it
was
only
temporary
during
the
period
of
time
that
the
coal
is
in
the
ground.
you
see,
for
the
miners
own
purposes...
that
is,
for
the
company's
own
purposes,
they
can
never
get
it
all
out.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
yes.
let
me
answer
that
question,
and
the
answer
to
that
one
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
we
would
have
a
claim.
and
here
is
the
answer.
and
the
factual
support
for
this
is,
incidentally,
is
in
the
record.
it's
contained
in
the
joint
appendix.
there
are
certain
parts
of
a
coal
mine
that
the
companies,
from
time
immemorial,
would
leave
only...
actually
more
than
50
percent
of
the
coal
in
the
ground
for
their
own
purposes:
for
safety
for
their
own
miners;
for
access;
and
for
ventilation.
and
those
are
sometimes
referred
to
as
the
mains,
the
submains,
the
development
entries,
and
so
forth.
those
are
the
parts
of
the
mine
that
for
the
miners'
own
purposes,
you
have
to
leave
substantial
amounts
of
coal
in
the
ground.
in
between
those
areas
are
what
are
called
the
mining
panels,
or
the
development
panels.
and
within
that
area
you
try...
the
effort
is
to
get
just
as
much
of
the
coal
out
as
you
possible
can.
now,
it
is
possible
in
many
instances,
and
the
record
bears
this
out,
that
in
setting
out
the
mining
plan,
it
is
possible
to
locate
these
areas
where
the
mining
companies
would
in
any
event
leave
underneath
the
protected
structures.
but
you
can't
do
it
in
all
instances.
and
what
happens
is,
that
there
are
3,000
structures
that
belong
to
my
clients,
and
this
is
also
in
the
record--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that's
right,
and
we
do.
and
we
do.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
of
course.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
no,
no,
no.
well,
we
have
made
the
effort.
because
it's
to
our
advantage
to
do
so.
some
of
the
mines,
of
course,
were
already
set
up
and
operating
prior
to
the
time...
prior
to
the
time...
that
the
act
came
into
effect.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
yes,
we
think
we
have.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
not
only
have
not
been
able
to
demonstrate
it,
justice
white...
the
answer
to
that
question
is
no,
we've
never
been
able
to
demonstrate
it.
and
we
alleged
in
the
complaint
that
we
could
not.
and
the
answer
to
the
complaint
was...
or
the
answer
to
that
allegation
was,
that
we
were
right.
let
me
say
just
one
word
about
the
contract
clause,
then
i
do
want
to
save
just
a
little
bit
for
rebuttal.
simple...
our
contract
clause
argument
is
this
simple.
the
contract
clause
is
there.
it
is
one
of
the
most
specific
provisions
in
the
constitution.
it
is
the
only...
it
is
one
of
the
few
in
the
original
1787
document
that
particularly
applies
to
the
states.
it
has
to
mean
something.
it
has
to
protect
some
contracts.
and
this
court
said
in
spannaus
that
the
height
of
the
impairment...
that
the
nature
of
the
impairment
measures
the
height
of
the
hurdle
that
the
state
must
clear.
if
the
contract
clause
does
not
apply
to
protect
this
particular
contract
in
this
case,
then
it
is
hard
to
see
that
the
contract
clause
has
any
value
at
all.
because
unlike
spannaus,
where,
as
this
court
said,
there
was
one
provision
that
was
modified,
this
case
does
not
involve
just
a
modification
of
a
provision;
it
involves
a
complete
rewriting
of
the
entire
contract.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i'm
really
not
saying
that.
well,
yes,
i'm
saying
that,
but
i'm
saying
one
other
thing.
i'm
saying
also
that
there
is
a
separate
ground
that
is
particularly
applicable
to
section
6.
but
we
do
think
we
can
win
on
both
grounds.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
mr.
chief
justice,
unless
the
court
has
questions.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
mister--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
and
only...
the
only--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i'm
not
sure
i
understand
the
question.
that
it
would
be
uneconomical--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well...
i
understand
the
question.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
is
economical
to
mine
the
other
50
percent.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
but
it's
the
30
million
tons
that
have
to
be
left.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
and
that
is
what
this
case
really
comes
down
to.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we're
arguing
both.
we
would
have
the
same
argument
for
the
support
estate.
but
it
is
made
theoretically
much
cleaner,
much
easier.
and
also,
the
case
on
which
we
rely,
and
the
case
which
has
not
been
distinguished
through
briefs
or
oral
argument,
also
happened
to
involve
pennsylvania
law
with
the
same
support
estate.
and
in
that
respect,
justice
scalia,
under
pennsylvania
law,
in
1970.17,
pennsylvania
supreme
court
case,
that
support
estate
can
be
owned
by
a
third
person
other
than
the
owner
of
the
surface
or
the
coal.
the
case
is
found
at
256
pennsylvania
416.
it's
cited
on
the
first
page
in
the
first
footnote
of
our
petition
for
certiorari.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
excuse
me?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
what
it
shows
is
that
the
support
estate--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--it
does
have
some
value
if
you
can
use
it
in
connection
with
supporting
your
mining
operations.
and
by
hypothesis,
as
i
mentioned
earlier--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
that
is
correct.
but
these
30
million
tons
that
we're
talking
about
are
what
we
can't
use
for
any
other
purpose.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
clearly
would
not
be
constitutional.
indeed,
go
back
and
look
at
john
w.
davis'
argument
in
pennsylvania
coal.
and
that
is
the
premise
from
which
he
started,
from
which
i
think
everyone
in
the
courtroom
that
day
started,
that
it
would
be
unconstitutional
to
require
concrete
pillars.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
would
not
be
a
taking.
it
would
be
a
different...
well,
i
think
it
would
be...
i
think
it
would
be
a
taking
in
the
same
sense
that
pennsylvania
coal
is
a
taking,
but
it's
regulation
that
goes
too
far.
but
it's
a
different
kind
of
"too
far"
concept--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--from
the
one
that's
here,
which
under
pennsylvania
coal,
clearly
does
go
too
far.
