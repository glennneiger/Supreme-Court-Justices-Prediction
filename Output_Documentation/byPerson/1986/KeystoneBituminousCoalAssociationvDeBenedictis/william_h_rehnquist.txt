we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
keystone
bituminous
coal
association
against
nicholar
debenedictis.
mr.
lee,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
let
me
get
back
just
a
minute
to
the
question
justice
o'connor
asked
you.
you
don't
really
dispute
the
9.4
percent
in
this
table
on
page
284,
but
you
just
say,
that's
applied
to
the
total
amount
of
coal
holdings.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
as
much
as
50
percent
can
be
required
to
support
a
particular
building.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
now,
50
percent
of
what?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
gordon.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
makes
it
difference
from
the
kohler
act
in
mahon?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
as
much
as
nine
percent?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
go
ahead.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
could
you
take
5
percent
per
year,
and
over
20
years
you
would
take
the
entire
thing;
but
so
long
as
you
do
it
in
5
percent
increments,
is
that
permissible?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
it's
only
economically
viable
use
of
the
property.
you
could
take...
to
take
away
a
good
many
uses,
i
take
it,
and
still
not
have
a
taking
under
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
gordon,
let
me
ask
you
something
about
one
of
your
responses
to
justice
scalia's
question.
is
it
your
position
that
a
takings
inquiry
would
be
different
if
the
state
comes
and
takes
one
acre
out
of
one
thousand
acres
as
opposed
to
taking
one
acre
out
of
ten
acres?
does
it
depend
on
how
much
you
own
and
what
percentage
is
taken
as
to
whether
there's
a
takings
clause
problem?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
let's
say,
simply,
the
state
wants
one
of
your
ten
thousand
acres.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
regulatory...
but
so-called
regulatory
takings,
which
you
say
involve
something
less
than
a
complete
taking,
are
to
be
judged
by
the
percentage
of
the
estate
that
is
disabled
or
impaired?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
fair
inference.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
think
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
gordon.
mr.
lee,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
