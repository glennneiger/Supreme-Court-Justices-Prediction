mr.
lee,
suppose
you
hadn't
taken
what
you
think
you've
taken
in
the
transaction,
namely,
the
support
estate;
that
you
bought
the
mineral
right...
mineral
rights,
but
you
didn't
take
the
support
estate.
what
would
your
argument
be
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
because?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
in
the
contract
the
surface
owners
just
waived
any
right
to
any
damage?
justice
byron
r.
white
then
it
would
just
be
a
contract?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
where
did
the
support
estate...
is
that
pennsylvania
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
have
you...
you're
really
saying,
then,
that
what
they've
taken
here
is
not
25
million
tons
of
coal
directly.
they're
just
taken
the
support
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that's
what
was
taken
in
the
pennsylvania
coal
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
you
would
just
be
a
contract
claimant.
it
wouldn't
be
a
takings
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
arguably?
or
i
thought
you
said
it
was--
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
same
contract
argument
that
you're
making
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
it
wouldn't
be
any
good
in
those
other
cases,
it
wouldn't
be
any
good
here.
i'm
not
saying
it
isn't
any
good,
but--
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what's
the
citation
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
has
pennsylvania
ever
recognize
a
support
estate?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
that
a
common
law
rule
in
pennsylvania
or
is
that
statutory?
justice
byron
r.
white
ancient
statutory
roots
in
pennsylvania?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
is
there
any
notion
of
why
such
an
estate
came
to
pass?
justice
byron
r.
white
some
reason
other
than
just
an
action
for
damages
or
a
duty
to
support
or--
justice
byron
r.
white
--mr.
lee,
what
precautions
are
taken
in
pennsylvania,
or
required
in
pennsylvania,
under
federal
law,
when
you
mine
coal
for
the
safety
of
miners
to
keep
the
mine
from
collapsing?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
leave
pillars
of
coal?
justice
byron
r.
white
or
do
you
put
in
steel
supports,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
would
you
suppose
that...
why
aren't
those
precautions...
why
wouldn't
those
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
any
requirement
for
support
and
to
prevent
damage
to
the
surface
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
safety.
justice
byron
r.
white
sure.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
i
really
want
to
know,
as
you
well
know,
is
why
do
you...
why
is
it
so
impossible
that
you
couldn't
satisfy
the
act,
this
act's
requirements,
by
saying,
well,
if
we're
going
to
mine,
we
can
easily
supply
the
support
in
another
way?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
that
were
true,
that
you
could
prove
that,
would
you
have
any
kind
of
a
claim?
it
might
cost
you
a
lot
of
money,
but
would
you
have
some
claim
against
somebody?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
act
does
say
that...
provide
a
mechanism
whereby
you
can
at
least
try
to
get--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
have
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
in
all
of
these
areas?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
any
statutory
remedies
you've
had
you've
exhausted?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you've
never
been
able
to
prove
up,
or
to
demonstrate,
that
there's
some
other
way
of
doing
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
really...
i
take
it
you're
really
submitting
that
even
though
you
lose
on
the
takings
clause,
you
should
win
on
the
contracts
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
i
don't
suppose
you
would
contend
that
if
during
these
years
instead
of
doing
what
the
state
did,
the
state
said,
by
the
way,
we
would
like
to
have
50
percent
of
your
coal
under
these
structures
and
we're
going
to
mine
it,
and
they
just
went
and
mined
it;
they
would
have
to
pay
for
it,
i
suppose?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
the
state
just
mined
the
coal
and
said,
you
can
make
plenty
of
profit
without
this
coal;
we
just
want
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
be
in
much
better
shape
if
pennsylvania
had
never
recognized
the
support
estate,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
might
address
that.
because
as
i
understand
it,
mr.
lee
said
that
he
would
be
in
tough
trouble
if
they
hadn't
acquired
the
support
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
that
would
eliminate
the
takings
argument.
it
wouldn't
eliminate
the
contracts
argument.
if
it
were
just
a
waiver.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
sounds
to
me
like
your
argument
there
would
take
you
to
saying
that
they...
by
regulation
you
could
reduce
the
value
of
a
piece
of
property
to
zero,
and
deny
the
owner
any
economic
value
of
it,
without
effecting
a
taking.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
where
your
argument
goes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
value
is
left
to
the
owner
of
this
25
million
tons
of
coal?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
pennsylvania
has
a
mineral
right,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
mean,
it
recognizes
the
rights
to
minerals
as
a
separate
piece
of
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
also
says
that
there
is
a
support
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least,
this
takes
a
piece...
or
this
reduces
the
economic
value
to
zero
of
a
piece
of
the
mineral
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
a
pennsylvania
law;
it's
a
piece
of
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
but
just
think
of
the
mineral
estate.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
there's
25
million
tons
of
that
mineral
estate
whose
value
is
reduced
to
zero.
justice
byron
r.
white
don't
you
think
that
you're
making
the
very
arguments
that
justice
brandeis
made
in
dissent
in
the
mahon
case,
and
that
were
rejected
by
the
majority?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
rejected
by
the
majority?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
25
million
tons,
that's
just
what's
involved
in
the
50
percent
of--
justice
byron
r.
white
--now,
i
take
it,
then...
i
take
it,
then,
that
you
do
not
contend
that
it
would
be
uneconomical
to
mine
the
other
50
percent?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
statute
says
you
can't
mine
any
more
than
50
percent.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
it
be
economical
to
mine
the
other
50?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
under
every
underground
acre
of
mineral
estate,
you
can
take
out
half
the
coal,
and
do
it
economically?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
would
that
be?
it
wouldn't
be
a
taking,
would
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
not
a
taking?
