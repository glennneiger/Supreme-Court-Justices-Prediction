justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you're
arguing
that
the
quantity
of
it
makes
a
difference.
and
i
think
the
import
of
justice
white's
question
is:
does
it?
if
there's
a
taking,
if
there
is
a
taking
of
property,
does
it
make
any
difference
that
you're
only
taking
a
little
bit
of
the
property?
or
if
you
leave
the
other
fellow
with
a
lot
of
his
property.
if
i
have
$200
million,
is
it
okay
for
you
to
come
and
take
$1
million
just
because
it's
not...
it's
not
very
much
of
the
total?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
what
proportion
you're
taking?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
it
does
if
you
haven't
established
that
there's
a
taking.
but
if
pennsylvania
coal
says
that
there's
a
taking,
then
what
difference
does
it
make
that
there's
less
of
a
taking
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
think,
unless
i
mistake
their
argument,
i
think
they're
saying
you're
taking
the
support
estate,
whose
value
is
measured
by
the
coal.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
we...
the
crucial
word
in
all
of
this
discussion
is
property.
and
you
want
us
to
look
upon
the
property
in
question
as
being
the
coal,
or
the
right
to
get
the
coal.
but
isn't
what
is
property
or
what
is
not
property
dependent
on
what
the
state
chooses
to
define
as
property?
some
states
will
give
you
property
rights
in
water,
and
if
you
take
that
away,
you're
taking
properties,
ferae
naturae.
i
suppose
different
states
have
different
rules
on
that.
here
pennsylvania
has
chosen
to
define
as
property,
as
a
separate
estate,
the
support
estate.
now,
aren't
we
bound
to
recognize
that
as
a
property
right.
and
hasn't
the
totality...
the
totality...
of
that
piece
of
property
been
taken
by
this
regulation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
excuse
me,
you
could
say
about
any
estate
in
land.
you
could
say
that
about
the
surface
right,
too.
it
has
no
economic
value
apart
from
the
ability
to
cultivate
it,
or
to
build
a
structure
upon
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
can
take
the
surface
right,
too,
without
any
consequences.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
you've
reversed
what
happened.
the
state,
in
your
hypothetical,
has
said
you
still
have...
you
still
have...
the
surface
right.
whereas
in
this
case
the
state
is
saying,
you
do
not
have
the
support
estate
any
more.
it
isn't
just
saying,
you
can't
take
the
coal
out.
it's
saying,
you
do
not
have
the
support
estate.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
just
like
saying,
if
you
take
only
one
of
my
hundred
acres
of
surface
estate,
it's
not
a
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
haven't
restricted.
you've
taken
away
entirely
so
many
acres
of
surface
estate.
now,
you
know,
it
wouldn't
occur
to
me
to
create
an
estate
like
that.
but
if
pennsylvania
has
chosen
to
create
a
property
interest
in
what
is
called
a
surface
estate,
you've
taken
so
many
acres
of
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
can't
the
owners
waive
it?
doesn't
that
take
away
some
of
the
very
appealing
public
interest
argument
that
you're
making?
the
owner
of
the
surface
land
can
waive
the
application
of
the
statute,
can't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
it's
for
the
benefit
of
the
surface
owner,
and
not
for
the
polity
at
large.
if
the
surface
wants
to
give
all
of
this
good
stuff
away,
he
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
that's
because
nobody's
willing
to
buy
the
waiver,
since
that
might
be
taken
away
by
some
later
statute.
i
mean,
they
already
bought
it
once.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lee,
could
you
settle
the
theoretical
quandry
that
was
raised?
are
you
arguing
that
there
is
a
taking
of
the
support
estate--
justice
antonin
scalia
--or
that
there
is
a
taking
of
the
coal?
