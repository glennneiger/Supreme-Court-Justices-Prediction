mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
tenth
circuit.
it
is
an
equal
footing
doctrine
case
and
involves
the
ownership
of
the
bed
of
utah
lake.
utah
lake
is
the
largest
fresh
water
lake
in
the
state
of
utah;
has
a
surface
area
of
approximately
150
square
miles;
is
located
in
utah
county,
which
is
roughly
40
miles
south
of
salt
lake
city.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
not
right
adjacent,
but
within
a
few
miles,
your
honor.
utah
bases
its
claim
of
title
on
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
one
aspect
of
that
doctrine
is
that
states
when
they
enter
the
union
receive
the
beds
of
the
navigable
bodies
of
water
within
the
states.
these
lands
are
held
in
trust
by
the
united
states
pending
statehood.
thus,
utah
asserts
that
when
it
entered
the
union
on
january
4,
1896,
it
acquired
the
title
to
the
bed.
the
united
states,
on
the
other
hand,
while
conceding
navigability
and
admitting
that
ordinarily
utah
would
have
received
title
at
statehood,
asserts
that
it,
in
fact,
retained
title
when
some
seven
years
prior
to
statehood
the
bed
was
withdrawn
and
reserved
as
a
reservoir
site
by
the
united
geologic
survey.
the
court
below
held
for
the
united
states
and
ruled
that
title
did
not
pass
to
utah
at
statehood.
the
authority
asserted
for
the
1889
withdrawal
of
the
lake
bed
is
an
act
of
congress
which
was
enacted
in
1888.
that
act
authorized
the
united
states
geologic
survey
to
investigate
the
arid
region
of
the
united
states
to
determine
the
extent
to
which
it
could
be
redeemed
by
irrigation.
u.s.g.s.
was
authorized
to
select
reservoir
sites
and
segregate
irrigable
land
in
this
arid
region.
the
act
provides
that
all
lands
selected
as
reservoir
sites,
canals,
ditches,
as
well
as
the
lands
made
susceptible
of
irrigation
by
such
reservoirs,
canals,
or
ditches
were
reserved
as
property
of
the
united
states
and
not
subject
to
entry,
settlement,
or
occupation.
it
is
utah's
position
that
that
act
did
not
fall
within
the
exception
that
this
court
has
recognized
in
order
to
defeat
utah's
title.
as
recently
as
1981
in
montana
v.
united
states,
this
court
summarized
the
rules
that
govern
the
exception;
held
that
the
united
states
may
sometimes
convey
the
bed
of
a
navigable
body
of
water
prior
to
statehood
if
it
is
necessary
to
perform
an
international
obligation
or
to
satisfy
a
public
exigency.
however,
that
intention
to
convey
must
be
clearly
and
plainly
expressed.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
i
do,
your
honor,
in
the
sense
that
in
order
to
defeat
state
title,
an
exigency
must
be...
must
exist.
i
think
that--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--no.
our
position
that
it...
that
it
requires
more
in
order
to
defeat
the
constitutional
entitlement
that
any
appropriate
public
purpose
is
not
enough,
that
it--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--it
is
not
in
the
constitution,
itself.
it
is
in
this
court's
analysis
of
the
constitutional
requirements
for
the
exception.
in
other
words,
in
montana,
the
court
noted
that
an
indian
reservation,
for
example,
may
be
an
appropriate
public
purpose.
but
unless
it
rises
to
the
level
of
an
exigency,
that
alone
is
not
sufficient
to
defeat
state
title.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes,
i
do,
your
honor.
the...
again,
the
exception
that
has
been
recognized
is
for
the
conveyance
in
the
situation
where
the
united
states
no
longer
has
title
at
the
date
of
statehood,
and
this,
then,
keys
off
the
trust
that
the
united
states
is
holding
that
land
in
trust
for
the
states.
and
if
it
has
it
at
statehood,
it
cannot
just
simply
say,
"we
think
we
have
a
better
use
for
it;
we're
going
to
withhold
it
from
you.
"
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
not
as
we
interpret
this
court's
decisions,
there
must
be
a
conveyance.
we
take
an
additional
position
that
even
if
the--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--we
think
the
court
has.
in
montana,
in
choctaw
v.
oklahoma,
and
in
the
holt
state
bank
case,
each
of
those
cases
involved
land...
navigable
waters
that
were
within
the
boundaries
of
an
indian
reservation.
and
in
each
of
those
cases
the
court
did
not
allow
the
analysis
to
stop
at
the
reservation
stage.
it
moved
on
to
see
if
there
had
been
a
conveyance.
and
if
there
had
not
been
the
conveyance,
then
state
title
vested.
the
only...
in
holt
state
bank
and
in
montana,
the
reservation
clearly
included
the
bed
or
clearly
included
the
stream.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
it
certainly
was
not
nearly
as
direct
as
it
is
here,
your
honor.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
we...
we
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
that
they
could
not.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
no.
beyond
the
analogies
to
the
cases.
and
you
say...
they're
not...
they're
not
a
square
fit.
but--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--that's
right.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
right.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
that's
right.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
we're
not...
we're
not
reaching
other
public
lands.
we
realize
that
the
united
states
has
those
and
can
do
with
them
as
it--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--no.
we
think
it
could
not.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
it
could
not
do
that.
and
in
response
to
justice
scalia's
case,
no.
we
think
it
we
could
avoid
it
because
the
capitol
is
not
on
the
bed
of
a
navigable
river.
certainly
as
to
the
land
within
d.c.,
they
could...
the
united
states
can
do
as
it
sees
fit.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
well--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--okay.
the--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--the
court
in
montana
stated
that
the
reason,
at
least
one
reason,
is
that
because
the
control
of
property
underlying
navigable
waters
is
so
strongly
identified
with
sovereign
power
of
government,
then
it
will
only
be
held
that
it
will
be
conveyed
for
the
exigency
situation.
and
i
think
that
then
goes
back
to
the
original
concept
that
the
thirteen
colonies
acquired
the
beds
of
navigable
streams
as
part
of
their
entitlement
under
the
revolution.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
the...
as
we
understand
the
law
there,
those
lands
were
held
in
trust
for
the
public
for
public
purposes:
navigation,
boating,
fishing,
and
related
type
uses.
and
that--
so,
no,
the
crown
could
not
have
just
simply
given
it
to
his...
could
not
have
given
it
to
his
friend.
that
was
a...
held
in
public
trust.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
that's
right.
and
so
when
the
states
succeeded
to
that
title,
they,
likewise,
not
only
got
the
land,
but
they
got
the
responsibility
under
the
public
trust.
and
the
states
are
limited
in
what
they
can
do
with
those
lands.
they
can
do
some
things,
but
they're
still
impressed
with
the
public
trust.
and
that
is
why,
i
think,
this
court
has
been
very
cautious
in
the
situations
where
it
has
allowed
the
state
title
to
be
defeated
because
it
is
so
identified
with
the
sovereign
power
of
state
government.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes.
in--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--in
the
choctaw
case,
the
court
concluded
that
there
had,
in
fact,
been
a
conveyance
for
the
benefit
of
a
third
party,
namely
the
indian
tribe,
not
just
a
reservation,
but
the
tribe
ended
up
with
a
title
interest
in
the
property,
and,
likewise,
concluded
that
in
that
circumstance,
there
was
a
exigency
that
needed
to
be
satisfied.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
the...
the
reason
is,
again
as
we
see
it,
simply
goes
back
to
the
constitutional
nature
of
the
doctrine:
that
the
state
is
entitled
to
it
as
part
of
its
sovereignty;
that
the
opportunity
to
defeat
that
should
be
very
narrow
and
very
limited.
and
that
is
why
the
court
has
characterized
the
ownership
by
the
united
states
as
"in
trust".
and
if
the
united
states
is
able
within
a
fairly
wide
spectrum
to
say,
"well,
we
don't
see
why
utah
needs
the
bed
of
this
stream
or
this
lake.
"
"we
think
we
have
a
better
purpose
for
it.
"
then
the
trust
really
loses
its
sanctity
and,
in
the
end,
the
equal
footing
doctrine...
states
that
are
coming
in
under
the
new
and
defined
doctrine
would
be
somewhat
less
than
the
states
that
are
already
in.
i
mean,
obviously,
the
state
would
prefer
no
exception.
but
we
realize
there
is
one.
we
believe
here
that
the
united
states
is
arguing
for
a
much
more
expanded
exception
because,
not
only
do
we
have
the
problem
with
the
ability
to
do
it,
we
say
that
even
if
the
court
were
to
allow
this...
were
to
allow
the
united
states
to
do
this
conceptually,
this
reservation
doesn't
satisfy
the
criteria
that
the
court
has
staked
out.
in
other
words,
the
act
here,
it
was
broad,
general.
it
referred
to
the
arid
region
of
the
united
states.
there
was
no
reference
to
utah
lake
specifically,
no
reference
to
sovereign
lands
generally,
certainly
no
conveyance
in
the
act
and
none
authorized.
we
submit
that,
in
this
situation,
even
if
the
court
were
to
consider
expanding
the
rule,
that
this
reservation
falls
way
short
of
what
should
be
required.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes.
the...
not
in
the
act.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
yes.
the
united
states
geologic
survey
designated
the
act,
or
designated
the--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--the
act
states
that
"all
lands
made
susceptible
of
irrigation
by
the
reservoirs,
and
the
reservoirs
are
hereby
reserved
from
sale.
"
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
that's...
i
assume
that
when
the
designation
is
made
that
it
is
then
reserved.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
it
doesn't
say.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
the
united
states
says
the
congress
later
ratified
it,
but
after
the
u.s.g.s.
reserved
it
by
the
administrative
act.
and
we
don't
deny
that
they
specifically
focused
on
utah
lake.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
we
don't
think
they
legally
did
it,
but
factually--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--yes,
there
is.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
it's
in
the
joint
appendix,
yes.
it
is
a--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--no.
what
they
did
is
they...
the
u.s.g.s.
director
sent
a
letter
to
the
department
of
interior
saying,
"i
think
utah
lake
would
be
a
good
reservoir
site;
i
think
you
ought
to
withdraw
it
and
reserve
it.
"
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
okay.
then
what
happened
is
u.s.g.s.
filed
its
annual
reports
with
congress
after
that.
and
the
1888
act
was
repealed
in
1890.
but
the
repealer
preserved
the
reservoir
sites
already
withdrawn.
and
the
respondents
argue
that
by
filing
that
report,
those
reports,
and
the
fact
that
congress,
even
though
it
repeated
the
act,
preserved
the
existing
sites,
that
that
is
a
congressional
ratification
that
is
sufficient
to
take
them
the
rest
of
the
way.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
no.
well,
excuse
me,
your
honor.
i...
i
think,
again,
for
the...
for
the
states'
constitutional
entitlement
to
be
defeated,
that
it
requires
more
than
just
the
filing
of
the
reports
with
congress
and
no
further
expression.
the
1890
act
did
not
say
a
word
about
utah
lake.
it
did
not
say
a
word
about
sovereign
lands.
in
fact,
it--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--no.
well--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--that's
right.
and,
of
course,
we
argue
if
they
had...
if
the
respondents
had
no
power
in
first
instance
to
do
it,
the
fact
that
they
did
it
and
reported
it
to
congress--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--that's
right.
that
that
was
not
sufficient
to--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--doesn't
make
it
clear
enough;
that
we're
entitled
to
more;
that
we
ought
to
have...
we
ought
to
know
when
those
sovereign
entitlements
are
defeated;
and
that
this
three-step
process
the
united
states
argues
is
not
enough
to
do
that.
and
finally,
although
we've
touched
on
the
exigency,
we
feel
and
submit
that
there
was
no
exigency
involving
utah
lake.
the
lower
court
found
the
facilitation
of
irrigation
a
public
purpose
motivated
by
a
public
exigency.
the
respondents
argue
that
even
less
is
required,
that
all
that
is
necessary
is
a
appropriate
public
purpose.
but
again,
as
i
have
stated,
this
court
in
montana
said
that
"no.
"
"you
must
have
the
exigency
or
you
cannot
defeat
state
title.
"
the...
we
believe
the
legislative
history
of
the
1888
act
demonstrates
that
the
problem
that
congress
was
addressing
was
a
problem
on
the
public
domain;
that
the
public
land
law
such
as
desert
land
act
being
abused
by
speculators
who
were
acquiring
these
reservoir
sites
and
irrigable
lands
and,
thereby,
thwarting
the
the
settlement
of
the
west
as
congress
had
originally
intended.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
there
is
some
language
in
utah's
enabling
act
dealing
with
federal
reservations,
your
honor,
that...
there's
nothing
in
there
that
addresses--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--i--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--i
apologize.
i
simply--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--that
is
essentially
what
it
is,
your
honor.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
that
is...
that
is
true,
but
again,
i
think
that
addressed
the
typical
type
reservation,
the
indian
reservation,
the
military
reservation.
it
did
not
address
an
administrative
withdrawal
of
the
lake
bed,
that
the...
the
taking
of
the
lake
bed
was
done
by
the
simple
administrative
withdrawal.
and
we
don't
think
it
falls
within
the
parameters
of
that...
that
document,
the
enabling
act.
further,
with
respect
to
the
exigency,
we
submit
that,
as
far
as
any
of
the
public
land
law
abuses
that
were
occurring,
utah
lake
could
not
have
been
part
of
that
problem.
utah
lake
was
not
subject
to
settlement,
entry,
or
occupation
under
the
public
land
laws.
it
was
being
held
in
trust
for
the
state.
the
united
states
had
recognized
as
much
when
it
segregated
the
lake
by
survey
of
the
seander
at
the
lake
starting
in
1856
and
ending,
essentially,
in
1878,
ten
years
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1888
act.
further,
the
bed
was,
or...
was,
and
is
water-covered.
settlers
could
not
simply
have
gotten
in
to
settle
it,
enter
it,
or
occupy
it.
and
finally,
if
it
is
true
that
the
purpose
of
the
1888
act
was
to
facilitate
irrigation,
water
development
in
the
west,
utah
lake
was
already
fulfilling--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--no,
not
in
our
view,
your
honor.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
they
could
not
have
done
that
because
of
the
trust.
thank
you.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
a
few
brief
remarks,
your
honor.
with
respect
to
the
federal
concern
about
potential
settlers
crowding
down
around
the
edge
of
utah
lake,
we
do
not
think
that
was
a
problem.
the
lake
bed
was
being
held
in
trust.
and,
in
fact,
it
could
not
have
been...
was
not
opened
to
settlement
and
entry
under
the
public
land
laws.
and
ten
years
prior
to
the
1888
act,
the
united
states
recognized
the
navigability
of
the
lake.
it
surveyed
it,
segregated
it
from
the
public
domain,
so
that
all
of
the
sales
of
property
were
down
to
the
surveyed
meander
line.
and
i
think
that
simply
is
not
a
justifiable
argument
that
the
settlers
would
encroach
upon
the
lake
bed.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
well,
yes.
it
had
already
been--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--that's
right.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
well,
that's
right
as
it
purports
to
withdraw
the
bed,
or
reserve
the
bed
to
the
federal
government.
it
had
already
been
reserved
for
utah.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
okay.
first
of
all,
it's
reserved
by
the
public
trust.
in
other
words,
they
hold
it
for
the
state
as
part
of
the
public
trust
obligation.
now,
we
take
the
position
they
wouldn't
have
had
to
survey
it
in
order
to
satisfy
and
make
sure
we
got
it.
but
what
we
say
is
that
one
of
the
things
the
federal
government
does,
and
did
at
that
time
throughout
the
west,
is
when
they...
when
there
was
these
navigable
bodies
of
water,
in
order
to
preserve
them,
they
were
surveyed.
that
survey
is
a
line
that
approximates
the
ordinary
high-water
mark
which
is
the
boundary
of
the
bed
and
the
upland
owner.
and
then
when
the
federal
government
sells
the
unoccupied
public
domain,
those
sales
come
down
to
that
surveyed
meander
line,
so
that
the
person
that
buys,
he
gets
a
metes
and
bounds
description,
but
he
doesn't
get
anything
below
that.
and
so
what
we
say
is
that
by
surveying
it
ten
years
prior
to
the
1888
act,
they
had
already
recognized
its
navigability,
its...
that
utah
was
entitled
to
it,
and
they
defined
the
boundaries.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
that's
right.
and...
but--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--to
a
limited
extent.
and
that
would
be
that
our
obligation
is
to
maintain
the
bed
in
such
a
way
that
the
public
trust
is
not
impaired.
we
believe
that
we
could--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--i
question
that.
we
think
that
we
could--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--and
some
of
them
are
being
sued
over
it.
we
think
we
can
issue
permits,
say
for
a
dock
or
a
wharf,
that
sort
of
thing--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--and
if
it
doesn't
impair
the
public
trust,
but
we
could
not
just
turn
around
and
sell
the
bed
of
utah
lake
willy-nilly
just
to,
you
know,
refurbish
the
state
coffers.
we
do
not
believe
that
we
can
do
that.
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
no,
because
of
the...
that
the
state
holds
it
in
trust,
not
because
of--
mr.
dallin
w.
jensen
--our
own
trust,
and
maybe
we've
made
that
a
little
confusing.
but
the
state
holds
it
in
trust,
once
we
get
it.
it
is
not
like
the
rest
of
our
land;
it
is
a
special
category.
and
it
is
impressed
with
the
public
trust.
just
a
word
about
montana
as
it
relates
to
the
specificity
that
has
been
talked
about
here
and
the
1888
act.
we
submit
that
if
the
united
states
could
not
defeat
montana's
title
under
those
facts,
that
the
1888
act
should
not
be
allowed
to
defeat
utah's
here.
my
time
is
up.
