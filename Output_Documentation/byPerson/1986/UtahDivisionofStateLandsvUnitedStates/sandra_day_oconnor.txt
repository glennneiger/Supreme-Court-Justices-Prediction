mr.
jensen,
do
you
think
the
public
exigency
requirement
is
anything
more
than
a
congressional
policy?
do
you
think
that's
a
constitutional
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
would
have
thought,
perhaps,
the
only
thing
the
constitution,
itself,
would
require
is
a
public
purpose
appropriate
to
the
territory
for
the
federal
government
to
retain
land
as
against
the
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
constitution,
the
public
exigency
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
there
is
any
difference
at
all
when
the
federal
government
wants
to
keep
it
for
itself
as
opposed
to
conveying
it
to
a
third
party?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
in
your
view,
there
is
no
mechanism
by
which
the
federal
government
could
retain
land
that,
otherwise,
would
pass
to
the
states
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
have
we
ever
had
an
occasion
to
address
the
situation
before,
if
when
the
federal
government
wants
to
keep
something
for
itself?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
counsel,
doesn't
it
say
in
the
utah
enabling
act
that
it
excepts
out
other
reservations
of
any
character?
isn't
that
the
language?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
government
argues
this
is
a
reservation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
congress,
itself,
has
to
take
a
look
at
it
and
say,
"yes,
we
really
do
mean
to
keep
title
in
ourselves
to
this
property.
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it,
otherwise,
would
go
to
the
state.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
many
other
sites
were
selected
while
that
act
was
in
effect,
and
in
how
many
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
how
many
states?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
kneedler,
in
most
instances,
wouldn't
the
federal
government
in
any
event
retain
its
navigation
servitude?
