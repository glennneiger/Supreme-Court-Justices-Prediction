justice
john
paul
stevens
but
general
jensen,
all
three
of
those
cases
involved
the
question
of
whether
a
conveyance
to
a
third
party
was
valid.
they
didn't
involve
this
question.
there's
no
third
party
involved
here
whereas
there
was
in
all
three
of
those
cases.
so
i
don't
think
you've
really
responded
to
justice
o'connor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
a
different
situation.
there
it's
a
question
in
each
of
those
cases
is
whether
there
had
been
a
conveyance.
the
problem
we've
got
here
is
when
there
is
not
claim
of
a
conveyance
to
a
third
party,
is
there
a
mechanism
by
which
the
united
states
can
reserve
property
for
its
own
use
that
will,
in
effect,
survive
the
creation
of
a
new
state,
and
which
i
don't
think
we
have
addressed
before,
have
we?
for
example,
is...
say
they
wanted
to
keep
property
in
a
military
reservation;
could
they
do
this,
or
whether
the
united
states
could
do
that:
west
point
and
the
hudson
river
or
something
or...
could
they
possibly
have
done
that
consistently
with
equal
footing
doctrine?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
think
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
there's...
you
have
no
authority
for
that
proposition?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
question
is
whether,
say
they
have
a
naval
base
an
the
anacostia
river
or
something
like
that,
could
the
united
states
reserve
title
to
the
anacostia
river,
if
it
created
a
state
for
the
d.c.,
assuming
the
river
is
within
the
boundary
of
the
district.
i
don't
know
whether
it
is
or
not.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
general
jensen,
supposing
we
go
back
to
the
beginning
and
ask
what,
say
massachusetts
joining
the
union,
and
supposing
one
of
the
beds
of
the
river
had
been
conveyed
by
a
monarch,
an
english
monarch
before
when
they
set
up
the
colony,
would
he
have
had
to
do
it
for
any
special
reason
or
maybe
just
gave
it
to
a
friend
because
he
wanted
to
give
him
a
little
patronage?
could
he
have
taken
that
out
of
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--the
lands
in
the
colonies
were?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question,
mr.
jensen?
supposing
that
before
utah
became
a
state,
the
united
states
realized
there
would
be
vast
mineral
resources
under
this
lake
or
other
riverbeds
and
decided
to
lease
them
out
to
private
developers
or
convey
them...
to
sell
them
to
private
developers,
would
it
be
your
position
that...
and
there's
no
public
exigency;
they
just
thought
it
would
be
a
good
way
to
make
some
money...
would
that
conveyance
be
valid
or
invalid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
could
not
have
done
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
how
do
you
distinguish
an
indian
reservation,
reservation
of
lands
to
be
used
by
indians
for
federal
purposes?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
reserve
for
the
indian
uses
just
as
you
reserved
in
this
case
for
reservoir
uses--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--and
in
one
case,
you
would
concede
that
that
reservation
wouldn't
defeat
the
state's
title
since
montana
holds
that,
i
guess.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
there
was
no
conveyance
to
the
indians.
but
it's
certainly
clear
there
was
an
indian
reservation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
nevertheless,
the
title
was
in
the
state.
why
wasn't
the
title
in
the
federal
government--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
key
to
your
case
is
a
specific
identification
of
the
bed
of
the
lake
as
having
been
reserved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
may
we
ask
you.
assume
that
we
agree
with
you
on
the
specificity
that
they
clearly
intended
to
reserve
it
for
this
particular
purpose,
what...
how
would
the
purpose,
the
federal
purpose
be
compromised
or
deviated
by
adopting
the
fundamental
argument
your
opponent
makes
that
it
just
simply
passes
to
the
state,
and
if
the
government,
the
federal
government
needs
it
back,
they've
got
to
condemn
it?
how
would
that
have
hurt
the
federal
purpose
underlying
this
whole
program?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
all
that
goes
to
that's
why
you
needed
the
reservation
and
needed
to
be
able...
needed
to
be
able
to
keep
settlers
off.
but
i
don't
understand
how
that
really
responds
to
the
constitutional
argument
your
opponent
makes
that
that
could
still
all
be
accomplished
by
having
the
title
to
the
bed
of
lake
vested
in
the
state
at
the
time
that
it
became
a
state.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
what
i'm
asking
is,
supposing
it
did
pass
to
the
state,
how
would
that
defeat
the
program
that
motivated
the
reservation
in
the
first
place?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
why
is
it
different
from
an
indian
reservation?
i'm
asking
in
terms
of
the
equal
footing.
why
really
do
you
need
a
different
analysis
than
in
the
indian
reservation
case
just
because
they're
more
specific
here?
why
can't
the
federal
government,
even
though
the
title
to
the
montana
river,
or
whatever
it
is,
is
in
the
state,
it
still,
the
federal
government
can
still
control
all
the...
what
happens
in
the
indian
reservation,
why
couldn't...
can't
they
still
control
what
happens
in
utah
lake
even
if
the
state
owns
the
bed
of
the
lake?
that's
what
i
don't
quite
follow.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
wanted
to
prevent
other
people...
well,
i'm
sorry.
justice
john
paul
stevens
maybe...
maybe
i'm
very
dense
here,
but
i
still
don't
understand
why
if
they
want
to
keep
private
development
out
of
the
lake,
why
can't
they
do
that,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
title
to
the
bed
of
the
lake
might
be
in
the
state?
i
don't
understand
why
there's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
they
don't...
all
they
want
to
do
is
do
is
prevent
private
owners
from
developing
the
land,
and
their
power
over
the
navigable
lake
is
sufficient
to
enable
them
to
do
that
even
though
the
state
owns
the
bed
of
the
lake.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
it's
clear
now,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
like
the
conveying
away
the
bed
of
a
river
on
an
indian
reservation.
i
would
think
the...
the
party
acquiring
title
would
realize
it's
an
unusual
piece
of
property
as
to
which
there
would
be
some
federal
interest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
of
the
federal
reservation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see,
you're...
because
of
your
own
trust
obligation?
