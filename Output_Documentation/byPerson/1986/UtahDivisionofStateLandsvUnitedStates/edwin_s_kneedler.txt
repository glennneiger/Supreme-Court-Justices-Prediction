mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
utah
lake
was
formally
selected
as
a
reservoir
site
in
1889
by
john
wesley
powell
who
was
then
the
director
of
the
united
states
geological
survey.
and
that
selection
was
made
to
the...
pursuant
to
the
sundry
appropriations
act
of
1888,
which
mr.
jensen
has
discussed,
which
responded
to
a
perception
by
congress
that
there
was
a
serious
threat
pending
to
the
future
irrigation
of
the
lands
in
the
arid
region.
the
record
is
this
case
unequivocally
establishes
that
the
geological
survey
selection
of
utah
lake
included
the
lake
bed.
the
tenth
annual
report
of
the
geological
survey,
which
was
formally
transmitted
to
congress,
said
that
the
reservation
included
the
lands
covered
or
overflowed
by
the
lake
as
well
as
those
bordering
on
it.
and
the
eleventh
annual
report
referred
to
the
selection
as
including
not
only
the
bed,
but
the
lowlands
around
it,
and
described
that
selection
by
sections
that
specifically
included
the
bed
of
the
lake.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
there
was...
the
general
concern
was
that
there
would...
that
there
would
be
impediments
to
development
of
reservoir
sites
for
reclamation.
those
included--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
not...
not
necessarily,
not
necessarily.
there
could--
for
instance,
in
this
particular
case,
although
that...
that
was...
that
was
certainly
part
of
it.
but
it
this
particular
case,
it...
it
soon
became
apparent
immediately
after
this
lake
bed
was
selected
that
rather
than
raising
the
lake
which
would
be
typically
true
of
the
natural
reservoir,
the
best
thing
to
do
would
be
to
lower
it
because
so
much
water
was
being
lost
to
evaporation.
so
the
lowering
of
the
lake
would...
would
expose
some
of
the
lake
bed
in
this
case,
and
that
would
invite
settlers
onto
the
exposed
lake
bed
which,
of
course,
could
implicate
the
very
purposes
of...
of
the
specific
purpose
that
you're
mentioning,
under
the
preventing
of
monopolization
or
impediments
to
the
development
by
having
private
entries
on
the
land.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
but--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
we
describe
in
our...
in
our
brief
in
this
case
that
even
though
the
lake
was
to
be
lowered
for
its
average
or
normal
level,
there
would
be
flood
periods
during
which
the
level
of
the
lake
would
rise,
not
only
to
its
average
level,
but
would
rise
above
that.
and
if
that
was
a
part
of
the
normal
operation
of
the
reservoir
for
irrigation
purposes,
it
would
flood
out
some
of
the
lands
on
which
settlers
had
entered.
that
would
require,
perhaps,
the
payment
of
compensation
to
the
settlers
who
had
moved
onto
the
land
and
established
farms
there,
just
like
the
maintenance
of
any
other
reservoir
system
that
periodically
floods
a
landowner's
property
would
create
problems
for
the
government
and
require
the
payment
of
compensation.
and
it
was
avoiding...
avoiding
the
payment
of
compensation
was
one
of
the
specific
purposes,
not
just
monopolization,
but
preventing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes.
there
was
a
proposal
to...
partly--
subsequently,
its
development...
the
plans
that
provided
for
diking
off
portions
of
utah
lake,
provo
bay
north
of
utah
and
goshen
bay
in
the
southern
portion
of
the
lake,
would
be
diked
off
so
that
that
land
would
be
essentially
drained
which,
again,
would
expose
both
of
those
areas
to
possible
settlement
and
monopolization
and
the
other
impediments
that
applied
anywhere
else
in
the
reclamation
project.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
the
lake
would
never
be--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
but
it--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
at
the
time...
at
the
time
that
the...
at
the
time
the
act
was
passed,
congress
was
acting
against
an
urgent
situation.
it
didn't
know
the
details
at
every
particular
reservoir
site.
mr.
jensen,
i
think,
is
not
correct
to
say
that
this
was
an
administrative
withdrawal.
congress,
itself,
mandated
the
withdrawal
in
the
act
itself.
congress
said
all
suitable
sites
for
reservoirs
are
hereby
henceforth
reserved.
and
that
was
interpreted
by
the
attorney
general
to
mean
as
of
the
date
of
passage.
that
suggests
that
congress
perceived
a
serious
problem
that
if
it
postponed
the
study
of
each
individual
reservoir
to
find
out
precisely
how
much
land
was
needed,
it
could
all
be
gone.
so
congress
thought
it
was
imperative
to
reserve
the
land
now
and
not
wait
for
the
delay
of
possible
administrative--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
congress
could
not
practicably
identify
each
potential
reservoir
site
in
the
west,
and,
therefore,
if
relied
on
the
geological
survey
to
identify
the
sites
for
it.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
those
entries
were
invalid,
and
that
was
the
interpretation
of
the
act
given
by
the
attorney
general,
given
by
the
implementing
instructions
of
the...
of
the
general
land
office.
and
the
memorandum
explaining
those
instructions
is
included
in
the
debates
on
the
1890
act.
congress
was
aware
of
that
interpretation
of
the
1890
act.
the
purpose
was
to
put
everyone
on
notice
as
of
the
date
of
the
passage
to
the
act
that
if
you
going
to
enter
onto
an
area
that
might
be
used
for
a
reservoir
that
you're
being...
it's
subject
to
being
overridden
by
the
selection
of
the
area
for
a
reservoir
site.
i
would
also--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--we
have
not
gone
to
that
extent.
what
we
do
believe
is
that...
that,
at
the
most,
all
that
would
be
necessary
is...
is
this
test
to
which
justice
o'connor
just
referred,
that
there
has...
that
there
would
be...
as
long
as
the
reservation
is
for
a
public
purpose
appropriate
to
the
purposes
for
which
the
united
states
holds
the
territory,
which
is
the
test
the
court
described
in
shively
versus
bowlby
and
is
repeated
in
the...
in
the,
i
think,
everyone
of
its
equal
footing
doctrine
cases
since
then.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
would...
it
would...
i
think
it...
there
has
to
be
a
specific
federal
purpose
for
it.
i
think
what
congress
cannot
do
is
say,
we...
just
a
bare
desire
to
defeat
the
passage
of
the
land
to
the
state
is
not
sufficient.
but
the...
but
the
origins
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine
suggest
this
distinction.
what...
what
the
court
was
saying
in
pollard's
lessee,
which
is
the
case
in
which
the
court
first
announced
this,
is
that
what
the
united
states
has
held
to
hold
in
trust
for
the
states
is
the
municipal
sovereignty
over
the
lands,
not
the
federal
sovereignty.
so
when
a
new
state
is
created,
what
passes
to
the
state
is
the
municipal
sovereignty,
the
ability
to
deal
with
that
land--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
a
state.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
no,
i
understand
that,
but...
but
title...
the
title
to
the
land
is
an
aspect
of
the...
of
the
state
sovereignty
because
of
the
public
trust
doctrine
that
mr.
jensen
referred
to.
the...
the
use
devoting
navigable
waters
to
public
purposes
is
an
essential
aspect
of
the
public
trust
for
the
lands.
and
that
is
deemed
to
be
so
central
that
the
lands
are
not
ordinarily
held
to
have
been
conveyed
to
private
parties.
and
the
united
states
is
held
not
to
have
to
be
able
to
act
like
a
state
in
a
state,
that
that's
up
to
the
state
to
decide
how
those
lands
shall
be
used
to
the
extent
that
that's
within
the
power
of
the
state
to
do
so.
but
there
is
in
pollard's
lessee,
itself,
the
court
made
clear
that
all
of
these
states'
right
acquired
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine
are
subordinate
in
certain
or...
in
appropriate
circumstances
to
where
congress
acts
pursuant
to
its
enumerated
powers
under
the...
under
the
constitution.
and
one
of
those
enumerated
powers
is
the
power
to
acquire
property
for
a
federal
purpose.
that
can
be
done
in
the
state,
not
just
in
a
territory.
i
think
this
is
an
important--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it's
done...
it's
done
by
condemnation.
all
that
is
necessary
in
those
circumstances
is
for
there
to
be
a
public
use
to
which
the
property
will
be
devoted.
and
this
court
in
hawaii
housing
authority
said
the
public
use
standard
is
essentially
co-terminous
with
the
government's
police
powers.
and
as
long
as
the
acquisition
of
the
property
is
necessary
to
furnish
further
an
appropriate
governmental
purpose,
that
that
satisfies
the
public
use
requirement.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
for
a
federal
purpose,
not
simply...
not
simply
to
keep
bare
title
and
defeat
the
state's
title.
it
has
to
be
for
a
specific
federal
governmental
purpose
pursuant
to
congress'
enumerated
powers.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
yes,
assuming
that
what...
assuming
that
that
or
anything
else
would
be
within
the
scope
of
congress's...
congress's
enumerated
powers.
and
i...
i'd
like
to
point
out
that
in...
in
pollard's
lessee,
itself,
at
two
places,
on
page
221
and
224,
the
court
made
clear
that
it
was
referring
to
lands
that
were
not
reserved
or
appropriated
to
another
purpose.
the
lands
that
were
being
discussed
in
that
case
were
unappropriated
lands,
the
public
domain,
the
sort
of
lands
that
the...
that
the
court
held
congress
was
holding...
the
united
states
was
holding
in
trust
to
turn
over
to
the
state
as
part
of
that
state's
receipt
of
sovereignty.
but
it
was
not...
it
was
not
discussing
lands
that
had
been
previously
reserved
or
appropriated
for
other
purposes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
is
something
of
a
hybrid.
it
can
be
viewed
as
a
conveyance
of
the...
of
the
beneficial
titles.
but
it's
also
a
reservation
in
the
normal
sense--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--that's
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
no.
montana...
what
montana...
all
montana
holds
is
that
there
was...
that
the
document
setting
aside
the
land
did
not
specifically
refer
to
the...
to
the
riverbed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
there
was
never
a
reservation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
way
the
court
described
it
in
montana
the
same
way
that
it
described
it
in
holt
state
bank,
that
there
was
a
reservation
in
a
general
sort
of
way--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--to
allow
the
indians
to
continue
to
occupy
the
land
that
they
had
always
occupied.
there
was
no
specific
mention,
unlike
here,
of
the
bed
of
the
navigable
water.
and
what
the...
what
the
court
held
in
montana
is
what...
what
the
court
relied
upon
was
the
absence
of
a
specific
designation
of
the
riverbed
as
withholding
the...
or
as
reserving
that
bed
to
the
united
states
in
trust
for
the
tribe.
it
wasn't
just
that
there
wasn't
a
conveyance.
the
vehicle
of
conveyance
was
the
reservation.
so
there
was
not
a
specific
reservation
of
the
lake
bed.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
and
that
is
exactly
what
the
court
said,
i
think,
in
montana:
that
it
is
necessary
for
it
to
appear
in
clear
and
special
words,
the
intent
has
to
be
clear.
but
where
the
intent
is
clear,
and
here
it
is,
then...
then
this
is
just
like
the
choctaw
case.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
as...
as
a
suitable...
as
a
suitable
reservoir
site,
i
may...
i
may
well
have.
it
was
well
known
at
the
time
that
natural
reservoirs
were...
were...
would
be
one
of
the
important
sources
of
irrigation
under
the
reclamation
project.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the...
this...
this
is
a
standard
problem
of
delegation
is,
is
john
wesley
powell's
selection
within
the
scope
of
the
statutory--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--do
you
mean
more
in
the
nature
of
specificity?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
here,
i
think--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
assuming
that
that
is
necessary,
i
think
that
is
met
here
by
virtue
of
the
subsequent
actions.
first...
first,
i'd
like
to
point
out
though
that
prior...
prior
to
the
passage
of
the
1888
act,
john
wesley
powell
had
prepared
his
famous
report
on
the...
on
the
lands
of
the
arid
region
in
which
he
specifically
proposed
utah
lake
as
a
reservoir
site
and
suggested,
for
the
first
time,
that
reservoir
sites
be
selected
and
set
aside
to
prevent
inhibitions
to
development.
so
when
congress
passed
the
1888
act
which
was
drafted
by
john
wesley
powell,
it
had
every
reason
to
expect
that
he
was
going
to
select
utah
lake,
and,
in
fact,
he
did
it
right
away.
so
this
is
about
as
close
a
nexus
with
respect
to
the
selection
of--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
interior
department
does
not
have
complete
figures
on
this.
the...
the...
what
happened
is
the
selections
were
filed
in
the
land
offices
in
the
various
states,
and
there
is...
there
is,
as
far
as
i've
been
able
to
ascertain,
no
comprehensive
list
of
how
many
were
selected.
as
of
now,
i
am
informed
that
they
have
records
of
approximately
40
selections.
but
we
don't
know
whether
any
of
them
involve
lands
under
navigable
waters.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
was
five.
several
of
those
were
clearly
in
states
admitted
to
the
union
before
1888:
california...
there
were
a
number
in
california;
there
were
a
number
in
colorado.
so
the
category
of
cases
affected
by
the
precise
issue
in
this
case
under
this
act
is
quite
small.
and
we
don't
know
of...
now
of
another
case.
but
i
would
like
to
continue
with
the
statutory--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--they
were
reserved
if...
whatever
was
designated--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
the
primary
source
for
what
was
designated,
and
there
could
have
been
others,
but
if
we
confine
it
to
the
category
that...
that
the
geological
survey
selected
and
formally
reported
to
congress,
that
is
a
matter
of
public
record,
not
just
in
the
land
office.
the
geological
survey
reported
to
congress
what
land
had
been
selected
by
section
by
section
in
the
case
of
utah
lake.
the
congress
then
in
1890
held
extensive
hearings,
oversight
hearings,
on
the
selection
of
irrigation
sites.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
brief,
there
were
sessions
in
utah
at
which
the
use
of
utah
lake
as
a
reservoir
site
was
specifically
discussed.
and
we
point
out
one
of
them
in
footnote
16
of
our
brief
at
which
the
chairman
of
the
senate
committee
responsible
for
those
hearings
specifically
referred
to
the
reservation
of
utah
lake
and
specifically
did
so
with
addressing
the
problems
of
the
1888
act.
it
was
pointed
out
that...
it
was
pointed
during
these
hearings
before
congress,
before
the
1890
act
was
passed,
that
the
level
of
the
lake
was
receding,
that
people
were
moving
onto
the
land;
and
that
this
had
created
some
problems.
and
the
chairman
says:
"within
the
last
year,
there
has
been
a
reservation
of
any
land
needed
for
that
purpose.
"
"and
the
government
will
survey
such
land
and
set
it
apart;
otherwise,
there
will
not
be
a
disposition
to
crowd
upon
and
settle
on
the
land.
"
he
was
responding
specifically
to
that
problem
in
saying,
"we've
taken
care
of
that
by
reserving
that.
"
but
also...
we
also
cite
in
our
brief
a
passage
during
the
floor
debates
on
the
1890
act
when
senator...
this
is
at
page
9146
of
21
congressional
record...
senator
sanders
said:
"i
hold
it
my
hand
the
tenth
annual
report
of
the
united
states
geological
survey
to
the
secretary
of
the
interior
for
1888
and
1889,
which
contains,
i
believe,
all
of
the
information
of
a
public
character
with
reference
to
reservoir
and
canal
sites
heretofore
selected
or
surveyed.
"
that
tenth
annual
report
includes
the
bed
of
utah
lake.
so
this
is
an...
and
then
congress
passed
the
1890
act
and
said:
"any
reservoir
sites
heretofore
selected
are
retained
as
property
of
the
united
states
until
otherwise
provided
by
law.
"
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
might
have
been
some.
as
far
as
we
know,
the
geological
survey
reported
to
congress
all
of
the
selections
during
any
particular
year.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
up
until
1890.
so
at
least,
with
respect
to
reservoir
sites
prior
to
1890,
in
response--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
act...
the
authorization
for
selection
of
arid
lands
was
repealed
in
1890.
there
was
still
authority
to
select
reservoir
sites,
as
i
read
the
1890
act
because
it
does
refer
to
reservoir
sites
"hereafter
selected".
but
with
respect
to
the
ones
previously
selected,
it's
clear
that
congress
had
the
information
before
it
and
ratified
those.
so
although
congress
didn't
say
utah
lake
in
the
statute,
it
did
say
"reservoir
sites
heretofore
selected".
it
knew
specifically
that
utah
lake
was
such
a
site.
and
it
held
several
days
of
hearings
in
salt
lake
city
with
witnesses
who
drew
irrigation
water
from
utah
lake,
and
it
knew
quite
well
what
the
situation
was
there.
and
congress
then
revisited
the
1888
act
in
1891
and
1897
as
we
explain
in
our
brief,
again
tailoring
the
operation
of
that
act
to
make
sure
that
the
reservoir
sites
selected
did
not
overreach.
but
it
never
rescinded
by
law,
as
it
was
required,
these
reservation
sites.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
that
was
one
of
the
specific
purposes
underlying
the
1888
act,
was
to
put
the
federal
government
in
a
position
where
it
was
going
to
have
to
condemn
land
in
order
to
carry
out
the
reclamation
project.
what
it
was
afraid
of
was
that
settlers
would
move
on
there,
and
in
order...
if
you
had
to
flood
the
land,
you'd
have
to
buy
out
the
settler,
or
if
you
had
to
put
in
a
canal
or
a
dam.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
in
this
case,
it's
important
to
distinguish
the
powers
of
the
united
states
after
statehood
and
prior
to
statehood.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
there's
no
doubt
that
after
statehood,
it
could
condemn
the
land
if
it
had
passed
to
the
state.
here
we're
talking
about
whether
the
land
passed
to
the
state
at
all,
and--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--at
the
time
that
this--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
congress
could
acquire
the
land.
but
again,
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
reservation
was
to
avoid
having
to
pay
for
the
land.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
they
might
be
able...
they
might
be
able
to
build
a
project.
the
congress
made
a
judgment
that
it
wanted
to
retain
in
federal
ownership
and
control
these
projects.
it
didn't
know--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
didn't
know
quite
how
it
was
going
to
develop
these
lands.
it
didn't
know
if
it
was
going
to
develop...
if
congress
was
going
to
provide
for
the
united
states
to
develop
them,
which
is,
in
fact,
what
happened
under
the
reclamation
act
of
1902,
or
whether
it
would
open
them
to
private...
private
development.
and
in
the
1897
act,
congress
overturned...
that
we
discuss
in
our
brief...
congress
overturned
an
administrative
interpretation
and
opened
up
all
of
these
reservoir
sites
to
private
individuals
and
corporations.
and,
at
the
same
time,
said
a
state
can
come
in
and
occupy
one
of
those
sites,
too.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
private
development...
there
could
be
two
problems.
one
of
them,
if
the
federal
government
needed
to
acquire
the
land
from
the
state,
it
would
have
to
pay
the
state.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
it
may
not
have
been
so
clear.
first
of
all,
the
state
could
have
granted--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
it
is...
i
think
it
is
clear
now
under
the
marsh
case
that
was
cited
in
the...
that
we
cite
in
our
brief
where
the
tenth
circuit
sustained
the
power
of
the
corps
of
engineers
to
regulate
dredge
and
fill
operations.
but
there
could
be
constitutional
problems
there,
too.
if
the
state
conveyed
away
the
bed
of
the
lake
to
a
private
person,
which
it
could
do
if
it
got
title
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine,
you
would
then
have
a
private
person
who
owns
land
in
the
bed
of
the
lake,
if
the
lake
bed
was
exposed,
we
would--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--it
may
be.
but
in
this
particular
case,
it
may
not
be
so
unusual
if
the
lake
bed
receded
and
the
state-owned
land
was
exposed.
the
state
could
turn
it
over
to
private
parties.
it
may
not
be
subject
to
entry
under
the
federal
laws,
but
the
state
could
turn
it
over
to
private
parties
who
could
then
enter
upon
it
and
create
problems.
i
should
point
out
that
disputes
over
the
ownership
of
bordering
lands
were...
was
also
a
serious
problem
at
utah
lake.
john
wesley
powell
testified
at
these
hearings
in
1890,
and
we
cited
in
a
footnote
in
our
brief
in
the
eleventh
annual
report.
he
said
that
there
had
been
a
dispute
between
those
who
wanted
to
raise
the
lake
and
lower
the
lake
because
of
the
people
who
had
moved
onto
the
boundary
area.
and
the
mormon
church
moved
in
and
settled
the
dispute,
worked
out
the
dispute
between
the
two
groups
of
landowners.
so
here
we
have
a...
already
previous
experience
with
respect
to
the
problems
that
can
be
created
by
private
ownership
of
land
in
an
area
where
the
water
recedes
and
then
is
raised
and
is
lowered.
and
that's
precisely
the
sort
of
inhibitions
to
development
that
congress
was
concerned
about
in
the
1888
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
would
retain
its
navigation
servitude,
but
i...
but
that...
it's
not
clear
how
far
that
would
go
with
respect
to
the
operation
of
a
reclamation
project.
and
it's
also...
this
is
also
an
entirely
intrastate
navigable
body
of
water.
it's
not
clear
that
congress's
navigational
servitude
would
give
it
the
authority
in
this...
in
this
situation.
but
i
think
the
point
to
recognize
is
that
at
the
time
congress
decided
to
first
freeze
property
in
federal
ownership
and
retain
it
there
for
development
and
irrigation
of
the
arid
west,
it
had
complete
sovereignty--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
it
depends.
it...
it...
i
think
i'm...
i...
i
take
that
back.
i
think
i'm
thinking
of
constructions
of
the
rivers
and
harbors
act
rather
than
the...
rather
than
the
constitutional
limitation.
under
the
commerce
power,
congress
could
control
the
water,
but
it
would
not
necessarily
give
it
the
authority
to
control
the
land.
and
that
is...
that
was
what
congress
was
focusing
on
when
it
reserved
the
reservoir
sites
in
this
situation.
going
back
to
the
point
of
congress's
power
to
do
this,
because
i
think
the
statutory
authorization
is
clear,
we
submit
it
would
be
anomalous
for
congress
to
be
able
to
provide
for
the
disposition
of
land
underlying
navigable
waters
to
a
private
party
as
the
states
concedes
congress
can
do
and
as
the
court
held
in
the
choctaw
case
and
has
said
in
shively
versus
bowlby
and
other
cases.
in
that
situation...
and
not
to
be
able
to
retain
the
land
in
public
ownership
because
when
land
is
granted
to
a
public
party,
it
is
separated
from
sovereignty
in
the
words
of
this
court.
and
both
the
state
and
the
federal
government
lose
whatever
power
they
have
to
control
the
use
of
that
land
to
the
extent
that
power
derives
from
ownership
of
the
bed.
by
contrast
where
the
land
is
retained
in
federal
ownership,
the
federal
government
can
act
both
with
reference
to
the
special
federal
purpose
that
gave
rise
to
the
reservation
in
the
first
place
and
protect
the
interest
in
the
use
of
the
navigable
waters
in
the
same
way
as
a
public
trust.
so
the
reasons
for
presuming
against
a
conveyance
to
a
private
party
of
land
underlying
navigable
waters
apply
with
far
less
force
in
the
situation
where
congress
has
reserved
the
lands
to
a
public
use.
congress
can
condemn
lands
in
a
state.
but
at
the
time
it
acquired
this
land,
there
wasn't
a
state.
it
owned
the
property.
the
united
states
owned
the
property.
it
could
acquire
it.
it
was
essentially
acquiring
it
from
itself.
it
was
disposing
of
the
land
to
the
extent
it
owned
it
as
a
public
domain
and
acquiring
it.
it
doesn't
have
to
condemn
land
it
already
owns.
it
doesn't
have
to
pay
for
lands
it
already
owns.
and
so
it
acquired
it
at
that
time
as
federal
property.
and
because
it
was
federal
property
under
the
supremacy
clause
and
as
reflected
in
section
6
of
the
utah
enabling
act
that
justice
o'connor
referred
to,
that
land
was
reserved
in
federal
ownership
and
was
not
among
the
corpus
of
unappropriated
lands
on
which
the
equal
footing
doctrine
operates.
equal
footing--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
there
can
be...
there
can
be
withdrawals;
there
can
be
reservations.
sometimes
a
withdrawal
as
in
midwest
oil
may
just
be
preventing
someone
from
settling
upon
it.
but
you
can
also
have
a
reservation
devoted
toward
a
particular
federal
purpose.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
i
was
explaining
to
justice
stevens,
i
think
the
purposes
of
the
act
require
that
it
be
applied
to
the...
it's
a
lot
like
block
versus
north
dakota
in
this
sense.
the
purposes
of
the
comprehensive
act
require
that
it
be
applied
to
potential
claims
by
the
state
and
people
claiming
through
the
state.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
correct.
and
the
one
guide
we
do
know
in
the
utah
enabling
act,
congress
made
clear
that
lands
that
were
included
within
any
reservation
of
whatever
nature,
which
would
include
these
reservations,
were
not
subject
to
the
grants
of
school
sections
and
indemnity
selections
under
the
utah
enabling
act.
and
the
equal
footing
transfer
of
unappropriated
lands
to
a
state
is
a
grant;
it's
a
constitutional
grant.
but
it...
but
so
we
think
it's
consistent
with
the
relationship
of
the
states
upon
entry
into
the
union
that
what
they
succeed
to
are
unappropriated
lands
under
the...
under
the
navigable
waters,
but
they
don't
succeed
to
lands
that
have
been
taken
into
federal
ownership
any
more
than
they
would
the
united
states
capital
building
that
had
been
taken
into
federal
ownership.
thank
you.
