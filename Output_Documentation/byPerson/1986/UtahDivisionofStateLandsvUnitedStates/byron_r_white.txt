justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the...
there...
the...
there
was
designation
of
utah
lake,
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
no,
i
understand,
but
there
was
a
designation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
the
act
say,
and
when
did
the
act
say
that
it
would
be
reserved?
when
there
was
a
designation
which
was
reported
to
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
when?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
do
they
make
the
designation?
reporting
it
to
congress?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
was
there
later
congressional
action?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
do
you
know
they
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
there
some
record
that
they
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
have
you
ever
seen
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
they
just
got
it
in
their
own
files;
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
the
claimed
later--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
don't
you
think
that
congress
knew
which
ones
had
been
designated?
justice
byron
r.
white
this
is
your
alternative
argument
because
under
your
first
argument,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
congress
had--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
had
specifically
purported
to
reserve
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
you
say
there
wasn't
really
a
reservation
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
make
it
clear
enough?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
statehood
act
indicate
that
the
state
wasn't
going
to
get
any
title...
any
title
to
lands
that
had
been
reserved
by
the
federal
government?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
does
it
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well
then,
if
there
some
sites
that
are
unknown,
it
was
selections
after
that
report
was
filed?
justice
byron
r.
white
up
until
that
date?
justice
byron
r.
white
when
was
the
act
repealed?
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
kneedler,
i
suppose...
i
suppose
that
normally
when
there's
a
reservation
from
the
public
domain,
it
really
just
is
withdrawing
it
from
settlement
or
development
or
withdraws
it
from
the
operation
of
the
homestead
act--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
how
do
we
know...
how
do
we
know
that
the
reservation
that
was...
that
congress
authorized
here
was
meant
to
be
a
reservation
as
against
the
equal
footing
doctrine...
as
against
state
claims,
to
withdraw
it
from
the
operation
of
the
equal
footing
doctrine--
justice
byron
r.
white
--rather
than
just
what
the
normal
meaning
of
reservation
would
be?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
state
ownership
of
the
lake
bottom
might
be
inconsistent
with
this
development--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
a
reclamation
project?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
saying
the...
it
was
already
being
reserved?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
this
reservation
couldn't
possibly
have
applied
to
utah
lake?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
so
it's
no
reservation
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
then
the
united
states
says
that
after
that,
it
was...
it
was
taken
out
of
the
trust
essentially
by
the...
by
the
united
states
itself.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
some
states...
some
states
have
given
to
the
landowners
on
each
side
of
the...
of
the
navigable
river
title
to
the
riverbed
that
they
got
under
the
equal
footing
doctrine.
justice
byron
r.
white
or
oil
lease?
