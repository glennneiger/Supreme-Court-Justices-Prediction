that's
a
real
problem
for
d.c.
statehood
then,
isn't
it?
i
mean,
the
united
states
could
not
reserve
sovereignty
over
the
capitol
if
d.c.
should
become
a
state?
why
is
that?
well,
all
you're
talking
about,
mr.
jensen,
is
the
bed
of
navigable
rivers,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
reserving
sovereignty,
as
opposed
to
just
title
over
the
bed
of
a
navigable
river
be
any
different
from
reserving
sovereignty
over
any
other
chunk
of
land
as
far
as
the
equal
footing
doctrine
is
concerned
in
principle.
i
mean,
if
there's
some
constitutional
obstacle
to
the
government's
doing
that,
then
why
would--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i
don't
understand
what's
magic
about
the
bed
of
a
river--
justice
antonin
scalia
--as
opposed
to
the
capitol,
for
example.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we
have
allowed
it
to
be
defeated
in
one
instance?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
what
makes
that
different?
justice
antonin
scalia
now
why
does
that
have
anything
to
do
with
the...
with
the
rationale
for
the
constitutional
prohibition
that
you
just
described?
i
mean,
given
the
reason
for
the
constitutional
prohibition,
why
should
it
make
any
difference
whether
you've
conveyed
it
to
a
third
party,
or
you
want
to
keep
it
for
the
united
states?
in
fact,
i
would
think
you're
better
off
keeping
it
for
the
federal
sovereign
than
giving
it
to
some
selfishly
interested
third
party.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
this
was
responding
to...
to
the
concern
that
the
irrigation
needs
of
the
area
would
not
be
met.
that
concern
was
not
that
water
from
the
lake
was
going
to
be
used,
was
it?
that
concern
was
simply
that
dry
land
which
was
available
for
reservoirs
was
being
bought
up
by
land
speculators?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
of
the
homestead
laws
that
allowed
people
to
acquire...
to
acquire
land;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
wait.
i
don't
understand
that.
once
you
say
you
want
to
lower
the
lake
bed,
then
you're
saying
you
don't
need
the
lake
bed
as
a
reservoir.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
why
do
you
care
if
people
settle
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
would
the
lake
ever
be
completely
empty?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you
wouldn't
have
had
to
reserve
the
whole
thing
for
that
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
--you'd
just,
at
least,--
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about...
what
about
settlers
who
occupied
some
later
designated
sites
after
the
statute
was
passed
but
before
the
designation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it's
clear
only
after
john
wesley
powell's
designation;
right?
you
know,
you
just
spread
a
map
of
the
western
united
states
in
front
of
me
and
the
1888
statute,
i
wouldn't
have
picked
out
utah
lake,
would
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
say
i
find
it
less
than
clear.
would...
does
it
become
clear
with
john
wesley
powell's
designation
the
next
year?
justice
antonin
scalia
unless
you're
absolutely...
unless
there's
been
a
court
test,
and
you
know
that
he
hasn't
gone
beyond
the...
what
are
appropriate
reservoir
sites?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
right.
and
i'm
saying
when...
when
the
specification
that
you
acknowledge
must
be
made
is
made
by
delegated
authority,
can
it
ever
clear
enough
to
overcome
the
equal
footing
doctrine?
well,
i
don't
think
the
constitution
requires
that
congress
specify
in
an
act,
itself,
rather
that
addressing
a
general
category
in
delegating
it
to
the...
to
executive
officials
as
it
does
any
other
responsibility
to
make
appropriate
reservations.
this
is...
this
is
typically
necessary
with
respect
to
the
administration
of
public
lands.
congress
cannot
act
like
the
landlord
with
respect
to
decisions
about
all
the
land
that
is
in
federal
ownership.
it
has
to
turn
this
over
to
the
expert
agencies.
and
in
this
case,
it
was...
it
was
turning
it
over
to
the
person
it
knew
to
be
the
premier
expert
with
respect
to
irrigation
of
arid
land.
well,
i
guess
the
question
is
whether
something
more
should
be
required
if
it's
to
defeat
the
state's
acquisition
of
this
title
which
normally
is
expected
to
transfer
to
the
state
at
statehood.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
those
other
designations
that
we
don't
know
even
about
that
are
floating
out
there
in
land
offices
somewhere?
were
they
designated
with
sufficient
specificity,
too,
by
the
1888
act?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose...
suppose
we
have
another
case
that
comes
up
involving
one
of
those
other
sites
that
you
don't
even
know
about
yet
that's
out
there
in
some
land
office;
has
that
been
designated
specifically
enough
by
congress
to...
to
overcome
the
usual
application
of
the...
the
equal
footing
doctrine?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
that.
run
that
by
again,
will
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
jensen,
do
you
take
the
position
that
the
state
could
convey
good
title
to
land
within
the
boundary?
justice
antonin
scalia
could
you
sell
it
to
somebody
who
wanted
to
dig
a
mine
on
it
specifically?
