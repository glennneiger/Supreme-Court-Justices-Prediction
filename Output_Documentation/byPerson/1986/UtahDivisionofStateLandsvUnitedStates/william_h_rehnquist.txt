chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-1772,
utah
division
of
lands
against
the
united
states,
et
al.--
mr.
jensen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
which...
that's
what
the
equal
footing
doctrine--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--applies
to,
not
to
lands--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--in
general.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jensen.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
kneedler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
lowering
of
the
level
of
the
lake
and
raising
were
to
be
accomplished
by
dams?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
no
particular
reservoir
site
was
withdrawn
by
the
act
of
congress.
it
remained
for...
to
be
designated
by
the
secretary.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
it
your
position,
mr.
kneedler,
that
the
government
doesn't
need
any
particular
reason
to
reserve
land
in
the
territory,
that
if
it
wants
to
reserve
it,
that's...
that's
its
privilege?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
supposing
that
when
minnesota
was
admitted
to
the
union,
the
united
states
decided
that
it
probably
had
some
good
use
for
the
bed
of
the
mississippi
river
as
it
flowed
through
minnesota,
and
so
it
reserved
that
bed.
now,
so
long
as
there
is
a
related
government
purpose,
is
that
a
good
reservation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--now
pollard's
lessee
says
a
lot
more
than
that.
let
me
read
you
a
section
from
it
that
says:
"then
to
alabama
belong
the
navigable
waters
and
soils
under
them
in
controversy
in
this
case,
subject
to
rights
surrendered
by
the
constitution
to
the
united
states;
and
no
compact
that
might
be
made
between
her
and
the
united
states
could
diminish
or
enlarge
these
rights.
"
that's
not
just
talking
about
sovereignty.
that's
talking
about
land--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
it
could
be...
it's
done
by
condemnation.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
united
states
could
then,
if
it
felt
it
had
a
use
for
the
land
under
the
mississippi
river
in
minnesota,
reserve
that
at
the
time
of
statehood?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
it
wants
to
grow
hydroponic
vegetables
in
the
mississippi
river,
it
can
do
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
suggestion
is
that
for
the
government's
navigational
servitude
to
apply,
the
navigable
water
has
to
move
from
one
state
to
another?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
mr.
jensen,
do
you
have
anything
more?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jensen.
the
case
is
submitted.
