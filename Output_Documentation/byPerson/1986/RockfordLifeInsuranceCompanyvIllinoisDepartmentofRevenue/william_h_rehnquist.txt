86-251,
rockford
life
insurance
company
against
illinois
department
of
revenue,
et
al.--
mr.
griswold,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
mr.
griswold,
who
is
the
obligor
on
these
bonds?
chief
justice
rehnquist
there
isn't
any
intermediary
between
the
holder
or
the
payee
of
the
bond
and
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
there
it
says
at
the
beginning
on
page
56,
"the
issuer,
named
below".
now,
is
that
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
here
it
says,
"the
issuer,
named
below,
promises
to
pay
to
the
order
of.
"
that
is
certainly
some
form
of
a
promise
of
payment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
griswold.
we'll
hear
now
from
you
ms.
rosen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
not
liable
to
the
holder?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
liable
to
ginnie
mae?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
i
thought
the
reason
it
might
be
important
that
there
was
an
obligor
to
respond
to
any
complaints
on
the
part
of
the
holder,
other
than
a
government
corporation,
was
part
of
the
language
in
smith
against
davis,
where
it
says
that
one
of
the
characteristics
of
the
obligation
of
the
united
states
is
a
binding
promise
by
the
united
states
to
pay
specified
sums
and
specified
dates.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
primary
obligor
is
the--
chief
justice
rehnquist
--who
is?
chief
justice
rehnquist
that's
almost...
it
sounds
like
a
little
bit
of
gobbledy-gook
because
on
page
57
it
says,--
"however
the
issuer
shall
pay
to
the
holder,
whether
or
not
collected
by
the
issuer,
and
shall
remit
as
set
forth
below,
monthly
payments....
"
et
cetera.
now,
i
would
think
that
would
help
you
in
your
case
it
that
meant
what
it
says
but
you
are
saying,
in
effect,
it
doesn't
mean
what
it
says.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
says
you
shall
pay
to
the
holder
but
it
can't
be
enforced
by
the
holder.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
he
must
pay
to
the
holder;
is
that
what
you're
saying?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
the
holder
can't
enforce
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
rosen.
mr
griswold,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
griswold.
the
case
is
submitted.
