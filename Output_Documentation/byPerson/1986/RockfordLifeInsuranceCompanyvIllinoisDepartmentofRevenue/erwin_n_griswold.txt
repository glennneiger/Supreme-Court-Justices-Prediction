mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
the
question,
summarily
stated,
is
whether
certificates
of
the
government
national
mortgage
association,
popularly
known
as
ginnie
mae
and
i
shall
refer
to
it
as
ginnie
mae
in
the
argument,
guaranteed
as
to
interest
and
principal
by
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states,
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress,
are
subject
to
an
ad
valorem
property
tax
of
the
state
of
illinois.
i
will
seek
to
show
that
the
bonds
are
exempt
from
taxation.
first,
under
general
constitutional
principles,
including
the
supremacy
clause,
since
the
unqualified
government
guarantee
which
they
contain
is
the
key
and
essential
element
in
carrying
out
an
important
policy
deliberately
adopted
by
the
government
of
the
united
states
under
the
commerce
clause
and
in
providing
for
the
general
welfare.
and,
second,
pursuant
to
the
express
terms
of
section
742
of
title
31
of
the
united
states
code,
in
which
the
congress
has
long
provided,
since
the
civil
war,
that,
and
i
quote:
"all
stocks,
bonds
and
other
obligations
of
the
united
states
shall
be
exempt
from
state
taxation.
"
rockford
life
insurance
company
bought
the
bonds
involved
here
in
1977
at
a
time
when
illinois
did
not
impose
its
property
tax
on
ginnie
mae
bonds.
however,
on
december
31,
1978,
the
illinois
department
of
local
government
changed
its
rule
and
imposed
the
tax
for
1978.
that
led
to
administrative
and
court
proceedings,
as
a
result
of
which
the
tax
was
sustained
by
the
supreme
court
of
illinois.
rockford
then
brought
the
case
here
and
this
court
noted
probable
jurisdiction
on
november
10th.
in
considering
both
the
constitutional
and
the
statutory
questions,
it
is
important
to
have
a
clear
picture
of
the
history
of
the
government
national
mortgage
association
and
the
role
which
it
plays
in
the
housing
policy
of
the
united
states.
the
origins
go
back
more
than
50
years,
to
1934.
some
of
us
remember
and
others
have
learned
that
real
estate
markets
then
were
moribund.
housing
starts
had
dropped
from
937,000
units
in
1925
to
93,000
in
1933.
foreclosures
were
at
epidemic
levels,
as
this
court's
decision
in
home
building
and
loan
association
against
blaisdell
clearly
records.
before
that
time,
many
efforts
had
been
made
by
insurance
companies
and
others
to
insure
mortgage
debt
but
the
experience
was
disastrous.
it
was
in
this
situation
that
president
roosevelt
established
a
commission
to
explore
housing
finance
and
out
of
its
report
came
the
first
national
housing
act,
enacted
in
1934.
one
of
the
proposals
embodied
in
that
act
was
the
grant
of
authority
for
the
creation
of
federally
chartered,
privately
owned
national
mortgage
associations
with
power
to
buy
and
sell
mortgages
and
issue
bonds
against
them
to
the
general
public.
several
national
policy
objectives
were
expressed.
one,
to
provide
new
sources
of
mortgage
funds.
two,
to
provide
liquidity
for
mortgage
lenders.
that
is,
marketability
and
i
suggest
that
is
a
very
key
element
here.
three,
to
lower
the
cost
of
mortgage
funds
by
increasing
the
supply
of
funds.
and
four...
and
this
is
another
important
one...
to
move
mortgage
funds
from
localities
where
funds
were
available
to
areas
where
credit
was
in
shorter
supply.
despite
the
authorization
and
the
hopes
that
lay
behind
it,
the
program
under
the
1934
act
was
a
complete
failure.
no
private
mortgage
association
was
ever
established
under
the
program
and
in
1948,
fourteen
years
later,
the
program
was
repealed.
in
1938
the
federal
national
mortgage
association,
sometimes
called
fannie
mae,
was
chartered.
one
of
its
purposes
was
to
create
a
secondary
market
for
mortgages,
thereby
channeling
federal
credit
to
the
housing
industry
but
fannie
mae
did
not
issue
mortgage
backed
securities.
in
1954
it
was
reorganized
under
a
new
charter
as
a
mixed
ownership
government
corporation.
it's
secondary
market
function
was
to
be
financed
by
bonds,
by
funds
borrowed
in
the
private
market
and
these
obligations
were
not
secured
by
the
united
states.
it
was
a
number
of
years
later,
in
1968,
thirty-four
years
after
the
beginning
of
only
meagerly
successful
efforts
in
this
area,
that
fannie
mae
was
divided
into
two
corporations.
one
of
these,
ginnie
mae,
government
national
mortgage
association,
was
established
as
a
wholly-owned
government
corporation.
the
other
corporation
retained
the
fannie
mae
name
and
government
ownership
in
it
was
terminated
on
september
30,
1968.
by
the
terms
of
the
statute,
ginnie
mae
is,
and
i
quote
section
1717(a)(2)(a)
of
title
12
of
the
u.s.
code:
"ginnie
mae
is
in
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development.
"
"it
has
no
board
of
directors
and
its
powers
are,
by
statute,
exercised
by
the
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development.
"
"it
has
a
president
who
is
nominated
by
the
president
and
confirmed
by
the
senate.
"
"its
other
officers
are
appointed
by
the
secretary
of
housing
and
urban
development.
"
thus
ginnie
mae
is
unquestionably
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
and
its
obligations
are
clearly,
in
the
normal
sense,
obligations
of
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
the
only
obligor
on
these
bonds
is
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
there
is
an
understructure
but
the
only
obligation
is
the
united
states.
the
joint
appendix
at
pages
56
to
the
end,
has
in
bold
type
the
text
of
the
bond.
i
have
lodged
with
the
clerk
one
of
the
exhibits
which
shows
what
they
look
like.
actually,
the
original
is
a
little
more
impressive.
it's
got
a
green
background
and
a
brown
border
and
this
is
the
seal
of
the
united
states
in
the
center
of
it.
but
the
language
is
on
page
58.
it's
also
on
the
bond
or
the
certificate,
a
copy
of
which
has
been
given
to
you.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no.
that
is
the
entrepreneur
who
assembles
the
package
and
takes
the
lot
to
the
government
national
mortgage
association.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but,
mr.
chief
justice,
let
me
just
point
a
little
further
in
it.
page
58
of
the
joint
appendix,
the
upper
righthand
corner
of
the
certificate:
"except
as
hereafter
undertaken,
this
certificate
does
not
constitute
a
liability
of
nor
evidence
any
recourse
against
the
issuer.
"
and
then
the
things
which
are
hereafter
undertaken
is
that
the
issuer
promises
that
these
are
true
and
valid
bonds
and
properly
handled
but
no
promise
to
pay
and
then,
at
the
bottom
of
page
58
appears
the
guaranty.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
what
it
says,
mr.
justice,
but
also
it
says
on
page
58:
"except
as
hereafter
undertaken,
this
certificate
does
not
constitute
a
liability
of
nor
evidence
any
recourse
against
the
issuer.
"
and
it
is
perfectly
clear,
i
submit,
that
the
holder
of
this
certificate
could
not
sue
the
issuer
and
get
a
judgment.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
nobody
contends
that
that
is
the
case.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
the
government
agrees
in
its
amicus
brief.
the
issuer
is
an
agent.
he
remains
an
agent
for
ginnie
mae.
he
collects
a
service
fee.
he
makes
what
he
gets
on
the
original
sale
of
the
bonds
but
he
carries
no
liability
to
the
holder
of
this
instrument,
despite
what
it
says
in
the
first,
because
that's
taken
back.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
all
depends
upon
what
actually
happens
along
the
way.
in
normal
course,
i
suppose
it's
the
mortgagor
who
pays.
he
pays
in
wherever
he
is
supposed
to
pay,
which
has
been
arranged
by
the
issuer
to
accumulate
the
funds
and
the
issuer
then
makes
the
payment,
if
he
has
the
funds
and
is
able
and
hasn't
gone
bankrupt
and
various
other
things,
to
the
holder
of
the
certificate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
no,
on
the
contrary.
the
issuer
has
obligations,
as
stated
here,
to
collect
the
amounts
and
to
account
for
them
and
to
remit
them
as
they
are
collected
but
he
has
no
obligation
to
the
holder
of
the
certificate.
his
obligation
is
to
ginnie
mae.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that's
because
that's
the
nature
of
the
arrangement.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
his
promise
is
effectively
to
ginnie
mae
as
the
underlying
guarantee
to
help
ginnie
mae
to
be
in
the
position
to
carry
out
its
unqualified
guarantee
of
the
payment
of
interest
and
principal.
i
think
we
cannot
overlook
that
language
which
is
printed
on
page
58,
which
is
clear
and
straight.
the
only
obligation,
suable
obligation
on
this
bond
is
that
undertaken
by
ginnie
mae,
pledging
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
of
that
he
is,
but
he
is
the
direct
promisee
of
the
unqualified
pledge
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states
made
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress
by
the
government
national
mortgage
association
and
that
is
the
heart
of
the
case
and
it
is
because
of
that
unqualified
guarantee
that
these
things
have
worked.
contrary
to
the
prior
experience,
where
mortgage
financing
was
not
very
successful,
ginnie
mae
bonds
are
now
approaching
a
120
billion
dollars.
not
million
but
billion.
as
senator
dirksen
used
to
say,
"after
a
while
it
adds
up
to
quite
a
lot
of
money.
"
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
language
says
that
and
that
calls
upon
the
issuer
to
perform
under
an
obligation
to
ginnie
mae
but
the
only
obligation
on
this
certificate,
as
clearly
stated
at
the
top
of
page
58,
is
by
ginnie
mae
and
it
does
not
constitute
a
liability
of
nor
evidence
any
recourse
against
the
issuer.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
my
view
that
there
is
nothing
that
the
holder
could
do
except
to
sue
ginnie
mae
and,
incidentally,
it
would
clearly
have
a
good
case
in
the
now
united
states
claims
court
because
of
a
contractual
obligation
of
the
united
states
to
the
holder
of
the
certificate.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
ginnie
mae
could
do
things;
yes.
ginnie
mae
can
remove
the
issuer.
it
can
require
the
transfer,
not
only
of
the
custody
of
the
mortgages
but
their
title.
it
can
deal
with
them.
it
can
do
all
kinds
of
things
but
the
only
obligation
to
the
holder,
is
that
of
ginnie
mae.
now,
ginnie
mae
is
unquestionably
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states.
its
obligations
are
clearly,
in
the
normal
sense,
obligations
of
the
united
states.
the
congressional
reports
leading
up
to
this
suggested
the
creation
of
a
mortgage-backed
securities
program
and
the
desirability
of
federal
government
guarantee
of
such
securities.
congress
adopted
such
a
program,
including
for
the
first
time
the
federal
guarantee.
the
program
has
been
a
great
success
and
it
is
quite
clear
that
making
the
federal
government's
credit
available
through
the
guarantee
has
been
the
key
to
that
success.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
well,
that
is
a
point
made
in
our
brief,
that
the
only
signer
of
this
is
ginnie
mae.
the
only
obligation
expressed
on
it
with
a
signature
is
ginnie
mae
and
the
terms
of
the
document
are
that
the
only
liability
which
is
carried
by
the
instrument
is
that
of
ginnie
mae.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
but
i
think
it
is
irrelevant
in
view
of
that
language,
"except
as
hereinafter
undertaken".
it
could
hardly
be
clearer
and
was
intended.
there's
an
aspect
of
the
1968
reorganization
which
seems
of
special
significance.
two
corporations
were
established
by
that
act.
one
of
these,
fannie
mae,
is
privately
owned
and
congress
expressly
provided,
twice
in
the
federal
housing
act,
now
found
in
section
17/19
of
title
12:
"the
corporation
#"--
that
is
fannie
mae.
"#
shall
insert
appropriate
language
in
all
of
its
obligations
issued
under
this
sub-section,
clearly
indicating
that
such
obligations,
together
with
the
interest
thereon,
are
not
guaranteed
by
the
united
states
and
do
not
constitute
a
debt
or
obligation
of
the
united
states
or
of
any
agency
or
instrumentality
thereof,
other
than
the
corporation.
"
and
the
contrast
with
the
powers
granted
to
ginnie
mae,
just
two
sections
later,
is
very
great.
i
may
add
that
ginnie
mae
issues
are
quoted
daily
in
the
wall
street
journal.
this
is
the
current
column...
it's
not
all
ginnie
mae...
ginnie
mae
is
down
here
under
the
heading
government
agency
issues.
ginnie
mae
futures
are
quoted
in
the
new
york
times
daily.
baron's,
which
is
a
widely-used
financial
sheet
under
the
heading
bonds,
government,
has
two
places
where
ginnie
maes
are
quoted.
one
of
futures.
mortgage
securities
dealers
make
primary
and
secondary
cash
markets
in
these
securities,
providing
for
both
immediate
and
future
transfer.
there
are
futures
markets
in
ginnie
maes
and
on
major
exchanges,
and
exchange-based
ginnie
mae
options
have
been
authorized
by
the
securities
and
exchange
commission.
any
broker
can
get
current
quotations
on
ginnie
mae
bonds
by
ticker.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
all
of
these
mortgages
have
to
be
guaranteed
by
the
veterans
administration,
the
federal
housing
authority
and
one
or
two
other--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--they
precede
it
and
that
is
the
explanation
of
why,
as
appears
in
the
briefs,
for
the
two
state
briefs,
that
ginnie
mae
has
only
paid
a
nominal
sum
under
its
guarantee.
the
underlying
guarantee
has
ginnie
mae
protected
by
the
fact
that
it--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--very
likely
not.
and
this
is
one
reason
why
i
have
been
stressing
this
marketability
quoted,
treated
like
bonds.
the
veterans
administration
undertaking
is
mortgage-by-mortgage.
you're
still
responsible
if
you
have
the
mortgage,
if
they
don't
pay,
you've
got
to
go
out
and
find
them
and
it
there
has
to
be
foreclosure,
you
have
to
do
it.
the
federal
housing
administration
is
an
insurance
program
and
there
are
a
number
of
limitations,
including
the
fact
that
the
interest
isn't
insured.
the
thing
that
has
made
these
things
marketable
and
which
has
attracted
large
sums
of
money
into
it,
is
this
unqualified
promise
of
the
united
states,
pursuant
to
an
act
of
congress,
pledging
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
yes,
i
think
i
do.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
is
certified
that
this
certificate
is
legal
and
regular
in
all
respects.
if
kissell
has
forged
them
in
some
way
or
has
not
complied
with
the
law,
they
would
still
be
liable
and,--
"it
is
duly
and
validly
issued,
pursuant
to
title
3
of
the
national
housing
act
and
that
no
rule,
regulation
or
other
like
issuance
and
no
contract
or
other
agreement
of
either
the
government
national
mortgage
association
or
the
issuer,
or
both,
adversely
affects
the
rights.
"
that
is
really
a
guarantee
of
regularity.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
now,
there
is
a
good
deal
of
talk
in
the
other
side's
briefs
about
the
case
of
smith
and
davis.
that
is
dealt
with
extensively
in
our
brief
and
in
our
reply
brief
and
i
think
i
will
leave
it
to
that
now.
the
introduction
of
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states
in
the
ginnie
mae
certificate
opened
the
floodgates.
thereafter,
the
financing
of
home
mortgages
was
like
traffic
on
a
four-lane
highway,
with
the
money
flowing
freely
to
a
total
now
approaching,
as
i've
said,
120
billion
dollars.
prior
to
that,
without
the
guarantee,
mortgages
were
not
effectively
marketable.
in
those
pre-ginnie
mae
days
it
was
like
a
winding
country
road
with
speed
blocks
and
the
money
only
trickled,
and
this
serves,
as
i
have
said,
to
distinguish
the
ginnie
mae
certificates
from
veterans
administration
guarantees
or
from
fha
insurance.
congress
has
spoken
in
broad
and
unqualified
terms
in
section
742.
within
both
the
ordinary
and
the
technical
meaning
of
the
language,
the
certificates
clearly
state
an
obligation
involving
the
full
faith
and
credit
of
the
united
states.
there
is
no
reason
to
give
that
language
an
artificial
construction.
whether
the
language
is
too
broad
is
essentially
a
political
question.
the
statute
can
be
changed
by
congress
where
the
many
competing
factors
can
be
appropriately
considered
and
i
would
call
attention
to
the
state's
brief,
page
33/34
where
they
say
essentially
that.
the
statutory
language
seems
unusually
clear
and
applicable
and
it
should
not
be
rewritten
by
this
court.
the
judgment
below
should
be
reversed.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
ms.
rosen's
final
argument
simply
ignores
section
742,
which
is
the
whole
basis
of
our
claim
for
exemption.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
that
question
isn't
here.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
i
have
thought
about
it
and
i
can
see
arguments
on
both
sides
of
it.
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
it
says
"income"
but
the
question
is
whether
the
income
is
actually
paid
by
the
united
states
or
is
paid
by
the
mortgagees
through
the
issuer
to
the
holder.
that
is
a
real
problem.
it
is
not
here
and--
mr.
erwin
n.
griswold
--in
any
event,
states
have
been
taxing
the
income.
on
the
other
hand,
states
generally
did
not
impose
property
taxes.
there
are
only
four
states
which
now
impose
property
taxes.
they
came
to
it
lately,
particularly
after
there
was
an
illinois
decision
sustaining
it
and
now
illinois
has
abandoned
the
property
tax.
it
is
perfectly
clear
that
the
key
to
the
success
of
this
program
is
the
government
guarantee.
using
patent
language,
"that
was
a
stroke
of
genius.
"
it
changed
things
from
one
level
to
a
wholly
higher
level.
as
one
of
the
witnesses
in
this
record,
joint
appendix
on
page
54,
said:
"but
rather
than
taxpayer
money
for
it,
the
ginnie
mae
was
one
of
the
real
beautiful
devices
that
has
come
along
to
attract
private
capital
but
you
use
the
government's
credit
in
order
to
make
it
credit
worthy.
"
and
this
is
a
situation
where
the
government
has
wisely
and
successfully
used
its
credit
but
it
is
the
government's
credit
which
is
being
used
through
an
instrumentality
of
the
united
states
and
that
should
make
it
not
subject
to
state
property
taxes.
