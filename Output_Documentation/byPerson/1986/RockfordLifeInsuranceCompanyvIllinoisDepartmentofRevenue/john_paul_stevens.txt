justice
stevens
mr.
griswold,
may
i
interrupt
mr.
griswold.
the
joint
appendix
at
56
reads
this
way:
"the
issuer,
named
below,
promises
to
pay
to
the
order
of
rockford
life
insurance
company.
"
and
the
issuer
named
below
is
the
kissell
company.
doesn't
that
make
the
kissell
company--
justice
stevens
mr.
griswold,
who
does
make
the
payments?
who
does
pay
to
the
rockford
life
insurance
company
the
money
that's--
justice
stevens
mr.
griswold,
can
i
interrupt
you
again?
toward
the
bottom
of
page
57,
there's
a
sentence:
"the
issuer
shall
remit
to
the
holder
all
such
monthly
payments
required
under
this
certificate
by
the
fifteenth,
15th,
day
of
each
calendar
month.
"
does
not
that
mean
that
pursuant
to
this
instrument,
the
kissell
company
has
a
duty
to
pay
over
to
the
rockford
life
insurance
company
the
monthly
payments?
justice
stevens
is
it
your
view
that
it
the
kissell
company
just
kept
the
monthly
payments
and
took
them
to
south
america
with
them
and
just
turn
them
over,
they
would
not
be
liable
to
rockford
life
insurance
company?
justice
stevens
mr.
griswold,
can
i
ask
you
another
question?
some
of
these
underlying
mortgages,
as
i
understand
the
record
here,
are
also
guaranteed
by
the
federal
housing
authority
or
the
veterans
administration.
justice
stevens
do
those
guarantees
precede
the
liability
of
ginnie
mae?
justice
stevens
if
they
were
already
guaranteed
by
one
or
two
other
government
agencies,
would
there
have
been
obligations
by
the
united
states
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute,
even
if
they
didn't
have
the
ginnie
mae
guarantee?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
another
question
about
the
intervening
layers
here?
justice
stevens
supposing
somebody
defaults
on
a
mortgage.
it
is
guaranteed
by
the
veterans
administration.
justice
stevens
and
eventually
the
veterans
administration
makes
good
on
the
mortgage
and
so
forth,
what
happens
in
the
interim?
now,
the
issuer
here
must
continue
to
make
the
monthly
payments
and
it
eventually
reimburses
itself
from
the
veterans
administration;
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
so
that
in
a
normal
default
situation,
ginnie
mae
doesn't
have
to
become
involved
at
all?
