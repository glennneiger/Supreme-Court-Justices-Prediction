ms.
patricia
rosen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court.
i
would
like
to
first
talk
for
a
moment,
if
i
might,
about
the
ginnie
mae
certificates
themselves
and
who
is
obligated
on
the
face
of
the
certificates.
as
the
court
pointed
out,
the
certificate
itself
states
that
the
issuer,
who
is
named
on
the
face
of
the
certificate,
undertakes
to
promise
to
pay
to
rockford
life
insurance
company
payments
of
both
principal
and
interest
on
the
certificate.
in
addition,
i
would
like
to
point
out
that
as
the
appellate
court
noted
in
its
opinion,
the
certificates
involved
in
this
case
are
what
is
generically
known
as
modified
pass-through
certificates.
that
is,
the
issuer
undertakes
to
pay
both
principal
and
interest,
not
only
as
a
straight
pass-through,
that
is,
as
those
payments
are
received
by
the
mortgagor...
paid
in
by
the
mortgagor,
but
whether
or
not
those
payments
are
received.
specifically,
i
would
like
to
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
57,
in
the
center
of
the
second
paragraph.
the
line
i'm
referring
to
reads:
"however,
the
issuer
shall
pay
to
holder,
whether
or
not
collected
by
the
issuer,
and
shall
remit
as
set
forth
below,
monthly
payment
on
both
principal
and
interest.
"
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor,
i
agree
that
the
holder
of
the
certificate
has
no
recourse
against
the
issuer.
however,
counsel
for
the
taxpayer
here
tries
to
make
that
the
determinative
factor
in
the
case
and
we
strongly
disagree
with
such
excessive
reliance
on
simple
enforceability
by
the
holder
of
the
certificate.
there
are
other
agreements,
as
pointed
out
by
both
the
appellate
court
and
the
supreme
court,
in
rejecting
this
argument
of
the
taxpayer.
the
issuer
has
promised,
not
only
on
the
face
of
the
certificate
but
also
in
the
guarantee
agreement
which
is
signed
with
ginnie
mae
and,
as
pointed
out
by
the
court
in
the
opening
argument,
ginnie
mae
is
the
one
who
enforces
this
obligation
of
this
issuer.
it
is
not
the
holder
of
the
certificate
but
it
is
ginnie
mae.
but
certainly
the
issuer,
in
this
case
the
kissell
company,
is
liable
on
these
certificates
and
that
liability
is
enforced.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that's
correct.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that's
correct.
as
to
the
nature
of
the
constitutional
and
statutory
immunity
which
is
being
discussed
in
this
case,--
ms.
patricia
rosen
--but
i
believe
what
the
court
was
referring
to
in
smith
versus
davis
is
that
the
promise
should
not
be,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
only
activated
in
the
event
of
the
default
on
the
basis
of
the
primary
obligor,
but
it
should
be
a
binding
promise
from
the
beginning.
in
other
words,
a
bond,
a
stock,
something
where
the
united
states
is
obligated
to--
ms.
patricia
rosen
--yes.
and
here,
the
united
states
is
not
the
primary
obligor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
the
kissell
company,
in
this
instance
that
we
are
discussing.
the
primary
obligor--
ms.
patricia
rosen
--it's
obligated
to
make
payments
of
principal
and
interest,
in
this
case,
whether
or
not
it
receives
those
payments.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
we
do
as
the
appellate
and
the
supreme
court
disagree
with
mr.
griswold
that
the
kissell
company
is
not
the
primary
obligor
in
the
certificates.
ms.
patricia
rosen
it
can
only
be
sued
by
ginnie
mae
to
enforce
its
obligations.
it
cannot
be
sued
by
the
holder
of
the
certificate.
it's
not
that
the
obligation
is
unenforceable.
the
obligation,
number
one,
is
there.
it's
printed
on
the
face
of
the
certificate.
it
is
in
the
guarantee
agreement,
so
it
is
obligated.
ms.
patricia
rosen
ginnie
mae
does
sue.
ms.
patricia
rosen
kissell
company.
yes,
they
can.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor,
under
the
language--
ms.
patricia
rosen
--yes,
your
honor.
under
the
language
which
i
just
read
to
you,
which
i
quoted
to
you,
that's
the
difference
between
a
straight
pass-through
certificate
and
a
modified
pass-through.
under
a
straight
pass-through
the
mortgagor
is
the
primary
obligor.
under
a
modified
pass-through,
which
is
what
we
have
here,
the
kissell
company
itself
undertook--
ms.
patricia
rosen
--let
me
understand
what
you're
disagreeing
with
me
on.
ms.
patricia
rosen
if
you
agree
that
ginnie
mae
is
the
one
who
has
the
primary
obligation
here...
is
that
what
you
are--
ms.
patricia
rosen
--it
is
obligated
under
the
terms
of
the
certificate
to
pay
the
amounts
to
the
holder.
that
obligation
cannot
be
enforced
by
the
holder.
it
can
only
be
enforced
by
ginnie
mae.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes.
ms.
patricia
rosen
i'm
saying
it
does
mean
what
it...
i
don't
understand
why...
it
means
what
it
says
but
that
obligation
cannot
be
enforced
by
the
person
holding
the
certificate.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes.
the
holder
has
no
recourse
against
the
person
issuing
the
certificate.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that's
correct.
ms.
patricia
rosen
because
that's
the
nature
of
the
modified
pass-through
program,
is
that
the
issuer
must
pay
whether
or
not
he
collects
from
the
mortgagor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes.
ms.
patricia
rosen
but
it's
enforceable
by
ginnie
mae,
not
the
holder.
essentially,
the
language
which
is
relied
upon
by
the
taxpayer
in
this
case,
is
simply
the
language
of
the
federal
guarantee
itself
and
that
is,
that
in
the
event
of
a
default...
and
only
in
the
event
of
a
default...
the
liability
of
the
united
states,
under
the
terms
of
its
guarantee,
is
triggered
and
in
the
event
of
a
default...
and
when
i
say
default,
i'm
referring
to
the
default
of
the
issuer
or
the
primary
obligor
on
the
certificate.
in
the
event
of
a
default,
then
the
holder
of
the
certificate
turns
to
ginnie
mae.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that's
correct.
under
the
circumstances
which,
hopefully,
i
have
just
described
to
you,
the
question
involved
in
this
case
concerns
the
ability
of
the
states,
in
particular
illinois
here,
to
impose
a
tax
on
these
mortgage-backed
securities
which
are
guaranteed
by
ginnie
mae.
more
broadly,
it
involves
a
question
of
the
doctrine
of
intergovernmental
tax
immunity,
which
unquestionably
provides
that
both
the
state
governments
themselves,
and
the
federal
government,
the
property
of
those
governments,
their
instrumentalities
and
their
obligations
must
be
free
from
taxation
by
the
other
government.
the
purpose
of
this
doctrine
is
to
allow
both
governments,
both
at
the
state
and
federal
level,
to
coexist
without
undue
interference
by
the
other
government,
through
the
exercise
of
its
taxing
power.
it
is
important,
when
deciding
any
question
under
this
doctrine,
however,
to
recognize
that
the
power
to
raise
revenue
by
taxation
is,
itself,
essential
to
the
operation
of
any
sovereign
government,
because
it
is
the
only
way
through
which
that
government
is
able
to
raise
the
funds
necessary
to
its
operation
and,
therefore,
this
court
has
always
been
unwilling
to
broadly
interpret
either
the
constitutional
or
the
statutory
immunity
from
taxation.
ms.
patricia
rosen
no.
that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
i
believe
because,
under
an
earlier
interpretation
by
the
department
of
local
government
affairs,
they
didn't
think
they
were
able
to
impose
the
tax.
there
was
a
question
raised
at
the
appellate
court
and
supreme
court
level
of
estoppel,
relying
on
a
previous
interpretation
of
the
department,
which
was
later
changed.
it
is
unquestionably
true
that
any
securities
which
are
issued
directly
to
raise
money
for
the
operation
of
a
government
cannot
be
taxed.
and
examples
of
those
securities
would
be
stocks,
bonds,
certificates
of
indebtedness,
treasury
bills
and
the
like.
however,
we
submit
that
this
immunity
should
not
be
extended
to
cover
obligations
which
are
issued
by
private
institutions
merely
because
they
are
federally
guaranteed
and
the
investor
has
no
recourse
against
the
private
issuer,
in
the
event
the
issuer
defaults.
the
taxpayer
in
this
case
wants
the
court
to
focus
upon
this
investment
transaction
from
the
perspective
of
the
private
investor
in
a
default
situation
and
we
submit
that
this
is
an
inappropriate
focus
for
the
court,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
it
gives
a
distorted
view
of
the
program
and
does
not
take
into
consideration
the
primary
focus
of
the
court
should
be
on
the
degree
of
interference
caused
with
the
operation
of
the
federal
government
and
the
operation
of
the
program
itself.
as
pointed
out
by
amicus
on
national
governors
association
and
the
like
in
their
brief,
38
states
and
the
district
of
columbia,
impose
not
property
taxes
but
income
taxes,
which
would
also
be
barred
under
the
interpretation
which
is
being
advanced
by
the
taxpayer
in
this
case,
since
neither
the
obligations
themselves,
nor
the
income
from
those
obligations
could
be
subject
to
state
taxation,
if
you
adopt
the
view
proposed
by
the
private
taxpayer
here.
ms.
patricia
rosen
very
few
impose
a
property
tax.
in
fact,
illinois
no
longer
imposes
the
tax
which
is
at
issue
in
this
case.
only
four
states
were
listed
as
imposing
a
property
tax
on
ginnie
mae
bonds
but
38
and
the
district
of
columbia
tax
the
income
from
the
bonds.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
there
were
a
number
of
replacement
taxes
issued.
under
the
illinois
constitution,
all
taxation
of
intangible
personal
property
was
repealed
and
the
state
legislature
was
required
to
enact
replacement
taxes,
to
cover
the
income
which
would
be
lost
by
abolishing
those
taxes.
ms.
patricia
rosen
i
believe
it
was
a
wide
variety
and
i
can't
specifically
name
a
particular...
they
were
state-wide
taxes,
called
replacement
taxes
but
the
tax
itself
was
not
abolished
having
anything
to
do
with
the
issues
which
are
presented
by
this
court.
it
was
abolished
along
with
all
other
property
taxes
on
intangibles.
and
as
i
pointed
out
previously,
focusing
on
the
recourse
by
a
private
investor
in
the
event
of
a
default,
is
inappropriate
because
it
gives
a
distorted
view
of
the
ginnie
mae
program.
default,
as
pointed
out
by
the
statistics
which
are
reproduced
in
several
of
the
briefs,
are
quite
rare
and,
therefore,
it
has
not
been
shown
that
the
state
taxation
imposes
any
real
impediment
to
the
success
of
the
federal
program
or
interferes
in
any
significant
way
with
the
operation
of
the
program.
as
of
fiscal
1984,
as
the
briefs
point
out,
the
cumulative
total
of
the
securities
issued
by
ginnie
mae
was
in
excess
of
215
billion
dollars.
contingent
liability
as
of
that
year
was
175
1/2
billion
dollars
a
actual
liability
amounted
to
$98,532.
to
require
the
states
to
refrain
from
taxing
a
program
in
excess
of
215
billion
dollars
on
the
basis
of
liability
somewhat
less
than
$100,000,
is
not
a
sensible
construction
of
constitutional
or
statutory
tax
immunity.
furthermore,
the
task
which
the
taxpayer
proposes
in
this
case
completely
ignores
the
real
consideration
whenever
this
court
seeks
to
determine
whether
securities
should
be
exempted
from
state
taxation.
the
focus
here
should
be
exclusively
on
the
degree
of
interference
with
the
federal
government's
program
and
such
interference
has
not
been
shown
here.
in
this
case,
the
immunity
which
the
taxpayer
seeks,
would
primarily
serve
to
shield
private
investments
from
state
taxation.
so
that
immunity
is
not
mandated
either
by
the
constitution
or
by
the
statute.
unlike
stocks,
bonds
or
treasury
bills,
ginnie
mae
certificates
are
issued
by
private
banking
institutions,
not
the
government
and
those
private
institutions
are
primarily
liable
on
these
certificates.
the
government's
liability
is
contingent
and
unliquidated.
the
issuance
if
ginnie
maes
does
not
increase
the
public
debt,
nor
does
it
secure
funds
for
the
operation
of
the
federal
government
and
these
were
essentially
the
tasks
which
this
court
stressed
in
the
smith
case.
in
smith
the
court
looked
to
several
factors,
but
the
factors
which
essentially
we
would
ask
the
court
to
consider
here
are,
first
of
all,
there
is
no
credit
instrument
or
instrument
which
is
utilized
by
the
federal
government
in
order
to
raise
revenue.
this
is
the
most
important
factor
because,
essentially,
what
this
court
is
doing
when
it
says
the
state
cannot
impose
a
tax
on
these
obligations,
it
is
excluding
an
entire
area
from
the
ability
of
the
states
to
impose
taxes.
where
the
area
relates
to
the
ability
of
the
federal
government
to
raise
revenue,
certainly
the
function
involved
is
an
essential
one
to
the
operation
of--
ms.
patricia
rosen
--well,
these
instruments,
as
i
pointed
out,
at
least
the
income
on
the
instruments
is
already
taxed
and,
so,
i
don't--
ms.
patricia
rosen
--no.
to
date
neither
the
department
of
housing
and
urban
development,
nor
ginnie
mae
itself,
nor
any
branch
of
the
federal
government,
has
ever...
nor
any
case
has
ever
found
that
these
instruments
were
federally
tax
exempt,
so
they
are
taxed
in
most
states.
ms.
patricia
rosen
i
don't
know
that
there
would
be
a
direct
economic
impact.
ms.
patricia
rosen
well,
in
this
case,
rockford
life.
we
pay
the
tax.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that
is
the
argument
which
is
advanced
by
the
taxpayer
in
attempting
to
argue
that
there
is
an
interference
with
the
federal
program.
ms.
patricia
rosen
well,
your
honor,
i
would
point
out
first
of
all,
that
there
has...
since
tax
is
imposed,
at
least
on
the
income
on
these
certificates
in
most
states,
there
hasn't
been
shown
to
be
any
serious
adverse
impact
on
the
operation
of
the
program.
ginnie
mae
started
issuing
these
certificates
in
1970.
by
approximately
1980
the
cumulative
total
issued
was
something
like
82
billion
and
by
1984
it
was
215
billion.
ms.
patricia
rosen
ginnie
mae
has
not
complained
and
certainly
under
those
statistics,
should
not
complain.
this
program
has
been
phenomenally
successful
without
any
declaration
that
these
securities
are
tax
exempt.
ms.
patricia
rosen
no,
your
honor,
that
is
correct
and
that
is
the
point
i'm
attempting
to
make,
is
that
these
are
taxed
and
there
has
been
no
adverse
impact
on
the
program
to
date
and,
therefore,
i
don't
see
that
there
would
be
any
additional
impact
if
you
sustain
this
tax,
your
honor.
ms.
patricia
rosen
that's
correct.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor,
they
have.
as
i
pointed
out
a
little
bit
earlier
when
i
went
through
the
statistics
for
1984,
it's
about
one
thousandth
of
one
percent
per
year
and
that
statistic
has
held
valid.
i
checked
six
years
and,
basically,
it's
been
less
than
one
thousandth
of
one
per
cent
of
the
total
outstanding
liability
each
year
that
i
checked.
ms.
patricia
rosen
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
correct.
that
is
part
of
the
initial
agreements
which
are
entered
into.
when
a
mortgage
lending
institution
wants
to
become
an
issuer
of
ginnie
maes,
they
assemble
a
pool
of
mortgages
generally
in
excess
of
a
million
dollars
and
then
they
apply
to
become
an
issuer
and,
in
doing
that,
their
financial
situation
is
scrutinized
and
also
they
must
supply
fidelity
bonds
to
guarantee
performance.
essentially,
what
the
taxpayer
seeks
to
do
in
this
case
is
to
expand
the
doctrine
of
federal
tax
immunity
to
cover
a
federally
guaranteed,
private
investment
transaction.
such
immunity
should
not
be
conferred
in
the
absence
of
a
decision
that
it
is
necessary
to
the
success
of
the
federal
program
and
we
submit
that
decision
is
one
which
should
be
made
by
congress--
here
congress
has
never
indicated
either
in
the
statute
creating
ginnie
mae,
that
these
bonds...
that
it
intended
to,
in
the
language
itself
nor
in
the
legislative
history,
is
there
any
indication
that
it
intended,
when
it
authorized
ginnie
mae
to
guarantee
these
obligations,
that
it
intended
to
confer
immunity
from
state
taxation
and
this
court
has
many,
many
times
indicated
that
the
question
of
whether
the
constitutional
and
statutory
immunity
should
be
expanded
is
one
which
is
best
left
to
congress,
because
it
is
a
question
which
is
essentially
legislative
in
nature.
congress
here
has
not
indicated
that
immunity
from
state
taxation
is
necessary
to
the
success
of
this
program.
the
program
has
been
phenomenally
successful
without
immunity
from
state
taxation
and
we
would
ask
this
court
to
agree
with
the
decisions
of
the
illinois
appellate
and
supreme
courts
and
to
hold
that
ginnie
mae
securities
are
not
obligations
of
the
federal
government
and
they
are
not
entitled
to
either
statutory
or
constitutional
immunity.
thank
you.
