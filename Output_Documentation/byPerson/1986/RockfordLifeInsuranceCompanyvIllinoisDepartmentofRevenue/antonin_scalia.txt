justice
scalia
--well,
wouldn't
the
issuer's
stockholders
object
to
that
and
sue
the
issuer,
if
the
issuer
doesn't
have
any
obligation
to
make
those
payments?
i
mean,
you're
telling
us
that
the
issuer
has
no
obligations.
justice
scalia
but
he's
paying
the
money
to
the
holder
of
the
certificate.
justice
scalia
it's
because
somewhere
there
must
be
a
promise
to
do
it,
because
otherwise
he
would
be
sued
to
death
by
his
stockholders.
justice
scalia
is
there
another...
you're
saying
that
the
holder
of
the
bond
is
a
third-party
beneficiary
of
an
agreement
between
the
issuer
and
ginnie
mae?
justice
scalia
you
wouldn't
need
a
signature
to
have
liability
on
it.
i
mean,
you
can
type
your
name
and
be
rendered
liable.
there's
nothing
in
the
law
that
requires
you
to
have
a
signature.
it
looks
nicer.
but
you
could
type
in
the
kissell
company
and
that's
enough
to
make
you
liable.
justice
scalia
mr.
griswold,
this
has
troubled
me
from
the
outset
in
this
case.
do
you
have
any
notion
as
to
what
the
phrase,
"except
as
hereinafter
undertaken"
means
in
that
magic
paragraph?
justice
scalia
i
keep
reading
it
and
reading
it
and
i
can't
find
anything
that's
hereinafter
undertaken.
it
says,
"except
as
hereinafter
undertaken".
justice
scalia
that
much
is
a
commitment
of
the
kissell
company
and
nothing
else.
i
see.
justice
scalia
if
i
understand
it,
you
say
it
is
the
obligor
but
can't
be
sued
to
enforce
its
obligations?
