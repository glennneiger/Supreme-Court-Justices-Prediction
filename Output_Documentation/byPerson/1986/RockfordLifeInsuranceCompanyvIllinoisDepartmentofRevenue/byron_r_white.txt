justice
white
--and
nobody
contends
in
this
case
that
is
the
case;
do
they?
justice
white
including
the
government?
justice
white
but
ginnie
mae
can
do
some
things
to
it;
can't
it?
justice
white
what
obligations
does
it
have?
justice
white
so
you
just
disagree
with
mr.
griswold
about
its
obligations?
justice
white
if
it
doesn't
collect
from
the
people
who
signed
the
mortgages.
justice
white
i
know,
but
ginnie
mae
can't
sue
this
company.
justice
white
suppose
all
the
mortgagees
default...
all
the
mortgagors
default?
the
mortgagors
just
default.
they
don't
pay.
justice
white
now,
is
the
kissell
company
independently
liable
to
ginnie
mae--
justice
white
--for
the
amount
that
is
not
paid
to
it?
justice
white
if
we
disagree
with
you
on
that,
what
if
we
agree
with
mr.
griswold,
then
do
you
lose
the
case?
justice
white
the
extent
of
the
obligation
of
the
kissell
company.
justice
white
if
we
agree
with
mr.
griswold
that
this
company,
the
issuer,
has
no
obligation
except
to
ginnie
mae.
it
has
no
obligation
to
the
holder
of
the
certificate,
does
it?
justice
white
so
it
has
no
obligation
to
the
holder?
justice
white
what
will
be
the
economic
result
of
permitting
taxation?
it
will
probably
require
the
interest
rate
to
be
raised
on
the
instruments
or
what?
justice
white
so
this
would
be
an
additional
tax?
justice
white
what
will
be
the
economic
effect
of
the
tax,
if
any?
justice
white
who
pays
this
tax?
justice
white
do
you
think
if
it
knows
it
is
going
to
have
to
pay
the
tax,
that
it
would
be
as
eager
to
buy
these
certificates
in
the
future
or
not?
at
that
interest
rate.
justice
white
if
it
would
force
the
interest
rate
to
rise,
it
will
certainly
increase
the
potential
liability
of
ginnie
mae.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
ginnie
mae
isn't
complaining?
justice
white
if
you
win,
would
state
income
taxes
on
the
interest
earned
be
immune?
justice
white
well,
i'm
asking.
justice
white
under
the
section
you
rely
on,
doesn't
it
say
interest?
justice
white
in
any
event,
states
have
been
taxing
the
income?
