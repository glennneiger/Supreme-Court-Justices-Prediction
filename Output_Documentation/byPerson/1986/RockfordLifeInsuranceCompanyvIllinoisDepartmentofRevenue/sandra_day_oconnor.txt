justice
o'connor
ms.
rosen,
do
you
agree,
however,
that
the
liability
of
the
issuer
is
without
recourse?
justice
o'connor
it's
an
obligation
to
the
holder,
without
recourse?
justice
o'connor
that's
what
it
is.
justice
o'connor
it's
an
obligation
without
recourse.
but
what
does
it
mean,
"whether
or
not
collected
by
the
issuer?
"
that
sounds
the
very
opposite
of
a
non-recourse
obligation.
justice
o'connor
how
many
states
impose
a
tax
like
illinois?
justice
o'connor
well
ms.
rosen,
i
understood
the
solicitor
general's
position
to
be
that
they
are
subject
to
tax
and
that
the
interest
rates
and
costs
of
these
certificates
have
already
taken
that
into
effect.
am
i
wrong?
justice
o'connor
the
issuers
are
required
to
furnish
bonds
to
guarantee,
fidelity
bonds
and
bonds
to
guarantee
the
payments
that
they
undertake
to
make?
