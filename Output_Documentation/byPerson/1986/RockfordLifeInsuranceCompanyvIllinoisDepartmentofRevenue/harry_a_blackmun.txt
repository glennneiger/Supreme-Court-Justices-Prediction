justice
blackmun
mr.
griswold,
one
thing
strikes
me
rather
peculiarly
on
the
instrument
you've
given
us,
and
that's
in
the
joint
appendix,
the
kissell
company
is
named
but
there
isn't
anyone
who
purports
to
sign
on
behalf
of
the
kissell
company,
in
contrast
to
immediately
below,
ginnie
mae's
secretary
and
president
both
attest.
is
there
any
significance
in
that?
justice
blackmun
of
course,
illinois
has
not
always
taxed
these;
have
they?
justice
blackmun
all
right.
justice
blackmun
was
there
a
replacement
tax
of
some
kind?
why
did
they
repeal
this?
justice
blackmun
what
kind
of
taxes?
