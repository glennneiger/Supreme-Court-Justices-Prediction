mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
first
i'll
address
myself
to
petitioner's
claims
of
a
violation
of
the
sixth
amendment
rights,
and
then
i'll
address
myself
to
the
correctness
of
the
trial
court's
charge.
in
this
case
petitioner
claims
that
his
trial
counsel
labored
under
a
conflict
of
interest,
and
that
this
conflict
manifested
itself
in
two
respects...
only
two
respects
identified
by
this
petitioner
from
the
record.
and
that
is,
the
alleged
shortcomings
of
trial
counsel
in
not
offering
this
petitioner's
testimony
against
his
co-indictee
in
exchange
for
a
sentence
less
than
death;
and
trial
counsel's
alleged
failure,
because
of
this
conflict
of
interest,
not
arguing
alleged
lesser
culpability
on
direct
appeal.
one
thing
i'd
like
to
make
clear
to
this
court
before
i
proceed
further
is
the
respondent's
position
with
reference
to
this
conflict
of
interest
claim.
and
the
respondent's
position
is,
as
found
by
the
district
court...
and
the
district
court
in
this
case
was
the
fact-finder;
the
evidentiary
development
was
in
that
federal
court,
not
in
a
state
court...
the
district
court
found,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
no
joint
representation,
no
conflict
of
interest,
and
no
adverse
affect
on
counsel's
representation.
now
moving
directly
to
those
only
two
respects
in
which
this
petitioner
contends
that
this
conflict
manifested
itself
in
adverse
effects
on
counsel's
representation,
though
counsel
here
would
have
you
to
believe
that
because
of
a
conflict
of
interest,
mr.
leaphart
did
not
offer
christopher
burger's
testimony
against
his
co-indictee,
the
actual
facts
reveal
that
mr.
leaphart
at
all
times,
prior
to
trial,
and
in
that
interim
period
of
time
between
the
decision
on
direct
appeal
which
reversed
the
first
death
sentence,
and
the
trial...
the
retrial
on
sentencing,
mr.
leaphart
attempted
to
engage
in
plea
negotiations.
now
mr.
leaphart
was
experienced
trial
counsel.
he
had
litigated
in
this
area
for
some
15
years;
had
tried
10
to
12
death
penalty
cases;
and
had
been
litigating
against
the
same
district
attorney
for
eight
years.
this
district
attorney--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--it
is
not
uncommon,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
it
is
not
uncommon.
i
would
not
go
so
far
as
to
say
it
is
common.
but
what
is
important
here
is
that
mr.
leaphart
and
mr.
smith
were
experienced
criminal
lawyers.
this
was
a
death
penalty
case,
an
extremely
heinous
death
penalty
case.
and
that
trial
judge
appointed
the
most
experienced
attorneys
that
he
could.
he
appointed
mr.
smith
and
mr.
leaphart.
and
mr.
leaphart
attempted
to
engage
in
plea
negotiations
with
glen
thomas,
this
district
attorney.
but
the
unrefuted
testimony
in
the
record...
unrefuted...
is
that
the
district
attorney
flatly
refused
to
open
any
avenues
for
plea
negotiations;
thus
plea
negotiations
were
never
engaged
in;
and
mr.
leaphart
never
had
the
opportunity
to
make
any
type
of
offer,
however
characterized
by
this
petitioner.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
yes,
he
has
the
conviction
in
his
pocket.
but
trial
counsel...
it
is
not
uncommon.
this
is
a
south
georgia
community.
and
counsel
who
routinely
represent
death
row
inmates,
as
does
my
opponent
here
at
the
bar
who
i've
litigated
against
for
some
10
years,
one
of
the
things
you
consider
is
that
in
a
small
community
like
this
that's
usually
rural
in
nature,
death
penalty
cases
cost
money.
and
after
reversal
on
the
first
appeal,
maybe
you
can
incline
the
district
attorney
to
take
a
plea
to
a
life
sentence.
mr.
leaphart
tried
to
do
this
in
this
case.
but
the
district
attorney
refused
to
even
discuss
it.
so
the
facts
in
this
record
reflect
that
there
was
no
offer
of
a
plea
not
because
of
some
conflict
of
interest,
but
because
the
district
attorney
opened
no
channels
for
communication.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
there
was--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--he
could
have
offered
it.
but
the
district
attorney
never
gave
him
an
opportunity
to,
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
why
would
he
want
it?
you've
got
a
detailed
confession
from
christopher
burger,
not
only
signed
but
sworn
to;
and
that
after
making
this
confession,
christopher
burger
took
the
authorities
to
the
area
where
this
burrow
pit
filled
with
water,
where
the
car
was
located.
why
would
he
want
testimony.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
it
was
not.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
stevens
had
also
confessed
in
intricate
detail
to
all
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
crime,
including
the
oral
and
anal
sexual
assault
of
this
fellow
soldier
who
they
killed.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
mr.
leaphart
testified
that
after
his
reversal
on
appeal,
and
his
billing
records
to
the
county
reflect,
he
had
further
conferences
with
the
mother,
with
christopher
burger,
and
even
as...
mr.
leaphart
testified
to
and
the
record
reflects
that
the
jury
was
out
for
a
period
of
time
before
returning
the
original
sentence
of
death.
and
they
came
back
and
asked
for
another
charge
on
the
possibility
of
parole.
mr.
leaphart
after
the
original
trial
did
not
doubt
his
strategy,
but
having
to
try
this
case
again
before
a
new
jury,
and
after
having
found
no
additional
information
favorable
to
mr.
burger,
had
no
reason
to
depart
from
his
strategy.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
he
supplemented
and
amplified
his
strategy
by
use
of
a
graph
at
the
second
retrial
in
which
he
listed
the
disparities
in
age
and
criminal
actions
accomplished
by
both
this
petitioner
and
his
co-indictee.
and
what
is
important
is
that
it
was
some
six
years
after
retrial
when
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
was
had,
and
present
counsel
before
this
court
still
has
not
come
up
with
any
additional
information
of
substance
that
mr.
leaphart
could
not
find
in
that
period
of
time
between
the
reversal
of
the
original
death
sentence
and
the
retrial
on
sentencing.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
he
consulted
again
with
his
client,
with
his
client's
mother,
and
those
were
the
only
two
individuals--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--he
consulted
with
his
client,
his
client's
mother,
the
only
two
individuals
known
to
him.
he
perused
the
trial
transcript.
he
rethought
his
strategy.
he
supplemented
his
strategy.
and
he
retried
the
case.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
mr.
leaphart
testified
that
he
was
never
given
any
information
by
his
client
or
his
client's
mother
on
which
to
move.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
that
is
not
my
answer.
my
answer
is--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--he
reevaluated
the
case
in
consultation
with
his
client.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
he
reevaluated
the
case
after
consultation
with
his
client
and
his
client's
mother,
the
only
two
individuals
known
to
him.
he
had
no
new
evidence.
and
even
at
this
point
present
counsel
has
not
shown
this
court
any
new
evidence.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
mr.
leaphart--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--i'm
trying
to
answer
the
court's
question,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
prior
to
trial.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
prior
to
trial,
your
honor.
mr.
leaphart
retained
a
psychologist
to
examine
christopher
burger.
this
psychologist
retained
by
trial
counsel
evaluated
the
defendant
and
informed
mr.
leaphart
that
mr.
burger
had
an
iq
of
82,
and
that
mr.
burger
could
distinguish
right
from
wrong
at
the
time
of
the
offense;
that
mr.
burger
was
a
sociopath;
that
mr.
burger,
to
quote
the
psychologist's
language,
was
as
compelled
to
do
evil
as
a
minister
was
to
do
good,
that
mr.
burger
was
prone
to
hurt
people.
mr.
leaphart
knew
this
to
be
the
testimony
of
the
psychologist
that
he
had
retained,
and
this
testimony
was
previewed
at
the
jackson
denno
hearing.
and
mr.
leaphart
made
the
decision
that
that
type
testimony,
though
favorable
to
his
client
with
reference
to
his
iq,
was
too
detrimental
in
other
respects,
especially
if
the
psychologist
was
going
to
be
subjected
to
a
thorough
and
sifting
cross-examination
by
the
district
attorney,
which
under
georgia
law,
is
not
limited
to
issues
delved
in
on
direct.
so
prior
to
trial,
mr.
leaphart
knew
his
client's
iq,
as
a
result
of
his
investigation
in
preparing
for
trial.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
i'll
be
honest
with
you,
i
cannot
remember
that
specifically
from
the
record.
but
i'm
sure
the
record
will
reflect
it.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
the
only
other
respect
in
which
counsel
contends,
or
petitioner
contends,
that
trial
counsel
representation
was
adversely
affected
by
this
conflict
of
interest
was
counsel's
alleged
failure,
because
of
the
conflict,
not
to
argue
lesser
culpability
on
appeal.
now
what
the
record
evidence
reflects
is
that
mr.
leaphart
testified...
keeping
in
mind
that
mr.
leaphart
was
the
attorney
who
got
the
original
death
vacated...
he
testified
at
the
conclusion
of
the
retrial
on
sentencing,
he
perused
the
transcript
and
the
record,
and
he
raised
every
meritorious
issue
on
appeal
he
could
identify.
he
specifically
testified
that
while
in
his
judgment
an
argument
of
less
culpability
under
the
facts
of
this
case
was
palatable
when
presented
to
a
jury
and
in
the
imaginative
form
in
which
he
did,
when
the
facts
actually
reflected
that
his
client
was
the
killer,
the
actual
killer,
it
would
have
been
frivolous
to
argue
lesser
culpability
to
the
georgia
supreme
court.
he
testified
that
was
his
reason
for
not
raising
that
allegation,
which
relieves
this
court
of
any
necessity
to
speculate
as
to
some
conflict
of
interest.
that
testimony
is
unrefuted
in
the
record.
what
the
facts
in
this
case
reveal
is
that
this
petitioner
was
afforded
an
opportunity
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
to
present
facts
in
support
of
his
claims
of
a
conflict
of
interest.
he
has
not
done
that.
the
facts
in
this
record,
nor
prevailing
constitutional
principles,
would
afford
him
relief
on
this
claim,
and
the
district
court
and
the
circuit
court
so
held.
secondly,
this
petitioner
contends
that
trial
counsel
was
ineffective
for
not
presenting
potentially
damaging
character
evidence
on
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial.
now
this
is
not
a
case
in
which
trial
counsel
did
not
present
mitigating
evidence.
from
the
very
presentation
of
the
first
witness
of
any
substance
by
the
prosecution,
mr.
leaphart
began
developing
mitigating
evidence
on
behalf
of
christopher
burger.
on
cross-examining
mr.
botsford,
he
brought
out
the
fact
that
mr.
burger
was
17
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
and
his
co-indictee
was
20.
on
the
cross-examination
of
the
officers
who
took
the
confession,
he
brought
out
the
fact
that
christopher
burger
stated,
in
his
confession,
that
thomas
stevens
told
him
to
drive
the
car
in
the
pond.
on
cross-examination
botsford,
who
was
present
at
all
those
acts
preceding
the
murder,
mr.
leaphart
brought
out
the
fact
that
botsford
characterized
this
petitioner's
involvement
as
following
the
directions
of
thomas
stevens.
so
it
would
be
incorrect
to
characterize
this
case
as
one
in
which
no
mitigating
evidence
was
presented.
what
this
court
is
called
upon
to
do,
in
this
situation,
is
to
examine
the
totality
of
the
circumstances,
all
those
facts
as
they
existed
and
were
known
to
counsel
at
the
time
of
trial,
to
determine
whether
mr.
leaphart's
decision
not
to
present
that
potentially
damaging
character
evidence
that
was
available
to
him
at
the
time
of
trial
was
a
reasonable
decision.
mr.
leaphart
testified,
unrefuted,
and
this
petitioner
was
present
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing,
did
not
take
the
witness
stand
and
testify
contrary.
mr.
leaphart
testified
that
his
client
provided
him
the
names
of
no
individuals
that
he
could
talk
to
or
use
as
potential
witnesses;
no
one.
mr.
leaphart
testified
that
notwithstanding
that
failing
of
his
client,
he
spoke
to
the
petitioner's
mother
and
had
consultations
with
her.
now
petitioner's
mother
testified
that
leaphart
never
made
any
efforts
to
contact
her,
and
that
she
only
talk
to
him
because
she
came--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
he
was.
mr.
leaphart
testified
that
after
mr....
dr.
o'hare
examined
the
petitioner...
now
dr.
o'hare
had
been
used
on
numerous
occasions
by
mr.
leaphart
in
the
past...
mr.
leaphart
discussed
in
great
detail
the
petitioner's
testimony
with
dr.
o'hare.
now
what
is
curious,
too,
is
that
in
his
consultations
with
dr.
o'hare,
this
petitioner
told
dr.
o'hare,
and
it
was
the
basis
for
his
evaluation
and
determinations
of
his
iq,
that
he
had
been
struck
in
the
head
some
five
times
between
the
ages
of
nine
and
16,
severe
blows
to
the
head,
and
this
was
the
possible
source
of
his
brain
damage;
that
his
mother
was
dead,
which
was
not
true
because
his
mother
was
at
trial
and
testified
at
the
evidentiary
hearing.
mr.
leaphart
consulted
with
dr.
o'hare,
went
over
his
evaluation
and
diagnosis,
and
decided
that
this
testimony
would
not
be
favorable.
but
he
used
it
on
the
jackson
denno
hearing
in
an
effort
to
show
that
christopher
burger
lacked
the
requisite
intellectual
capacity
to
intelligently
waive
his
fifth
amendment
rights
under
miranda.
now
that
testimony
is
available
to
this
court
because
it's
in
the
jackson
denno
hearing
of
the
trial
transcript.
after
having
actually
heard
his
witness
testify,
after
being
subjected
to
cross-examination
by
the
prosecution,
mr.
leaphart
made
a
strategic
trial
decision.
and
strategic
decisions,
once
made
after
reasonable
investigation
of
the
law
and
facts,
are
virtually
unchallengeable,
to
use
this
court's
language.
he
decided
it
would
not
be
beneficial
to
his
client
to
use
that
testimony.
in
addition,
mr.
leaphart
review
with
this
psychologist
psychologists'
reports
from
indiana.
he
consulted
with
an
attorney
in
indiana
who
had
served
as
a
big
brother.
mr.
leaphart
testified
that
after
that
telephone
consultation
that
he
and
that
attorney
both
agreed
that
that
attorney
could
present
no
testimony
favorable
to
mr.
burger.
well,
i
understand
that
the
psychologist
couldn't
have,
or
the
attorney,
but
the
argument
your
opponent
makes,
and
i
just
want
to
be
sure
you
respond
to
it
properly,
was
that
the
way
in
which
mr.
leaphart
questioned
the
mother
and
presumably
also
the
psychologist
did
not
let
them
know
the
kind
of
information
that
was
readily
available
about
his
bouncing
back
and
forth
between
his
father
and
mother
and
all
the
difficulty
he
had
as
a
young
child.
now,
certainly
the
sources
of
that
information
were
available
if
he'd
asked
the
right
questions.
your
honor,
with
all
due
respect,
i
think
that
opposing
counsel's
characterization
of
the
record
is
not
a
fair
characterization.
mr.
leaphart
testified
that
he
consulted
with
the
mother
and
with
christopher
burger.
he
testified
that
he
told
chris...
in
response
to
a
question
from
counsel
for
the
petitioner...
that
mitigating
evidence
was
basically
anything...
you
can
put
up
anything
in
mitigation
under
georgia
statute;
anything
at
all.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
he
said,
anything
good
about
you.
but
in
addition,
mr.
leaphart
also
testified
that
he
was
aware
of
christopher
burger's
background,
and
obviously
he
acquired
this
information
from
questioning
of
christopher
burger,
the
attorney
in
indiana,
his
psychologist,
and
the
mother.
now
the
distinction
in
the
point
that
counsel
for
petitioner
makes
here
today
is
that
he
contends
that
mr.
leaphart
did
not
make
it
clear
to
the
mother
what
it
was
he
needed.
counsel
does
not
contend
that
mr.
leaphart
did
not
get
from
the
mother
the
information
he
needed
upon
his
questioning
of
her.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
the
record
reflects
that
what
mr.
leaphart
had
is
the
information
i
have
been
detailing
to
the
court.
the
only
information
that--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
and
mr.
leaphart
specifically
testified
that
the
only
way
he
could
get
that
information
across
to
that
jury
was
either
to
put
the
petitioner
on
the
witness
stand,
which
he
did
not
because
of
the
petitioner's
sadistic
attitude
and
his
gloating
attitude
in
describing
the
facts
and
the
circumstances
surround
the
kidnapping,
the
sexual
assault
and
the
murder.
he
was
afraid
he
would
alienate
the
jury,
number
one.
number
two,
he
couldn't
control
what
his
client
would
say.
because
he
had
told
him
not
to
talk
to
authorities,
but
christopher
burger
continued
to
talk
to
anyone
who
would
listen.
and
number
three,
he
was
afraid
of
what
the
district
attorney
would
do
with
christopher
burger
on
cross-examination
in
front
of
a
jury.
he
testified
that
he
did
not
use
the
mother,
because
the
mother,
subjected
to
cross-examination,
would
undercut
his
argument
and
his
entire
strategy
to
the
jury,
which
is
apparent
from
the
first
inception
of
cross-examination
of
the
first
witness
through
the
conclusion
of
closing
argument,
which
was
that
christopher
burger
was
the
less
culpable
of
the
two
defendants,
and
because
there
are
two
punishments
in
georgia
for
murder,
life
or
death
by
electrocution,
my
client
ought
to
get
the
least
harsh
punishment.
if
the
mother
had
taken
the
witness
stand,
she
would
have
testified
to
the
troubled
background,
but
also,
the
involvement
with
marijuana,
the
fact
that
he
had
been
in
trouble
before
in
the
past.
mr.
leaphart
testified
about
prior
assaultive
encounters
that
mr.
burger
had
had.
and
though
the
record
is
not
extremely
extensive
on
that
point,
it
does
show
that
mr.
leaphart
had
reasonable
strategic
decisions
for
not
using
the
mother.
and
the
only
two
people
available
was
the
mother
and
christopher
burger.
counsel
now
only
belatedly
some
six
years
after
trial
has
been
able
to
find
affidavits
from
seven
people;
only
seven
people.
and
while
those
seven
individuals
attest
to
the
troubled
background
of
christopher
burger,
they
also
carry
with
them
in
their
affidavits,
which
i
assume
were
drawn
more
favorably
to
this
petitioner,
extremely
damaging
testimony.
the
grandmother
testified
that
christopher
burger
was
a
very
bright
child,
which
is
contrary
to
the
representation--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--swore
in
the
affidavit
that
christopher
burger
was
a
bright
child;
totally
contrary
to
the
representations
made
by
counsel
here
today.
the
uncle
testified
that
at
one
moment
christopher
burger
would
be
a
nice,
normal
guy,
and
that
the
next
moment
he
would
flip
out
and
become
violent.
the
girl
friend
testified
that
christopher
burger
had
a
hair
trigger
temper,
and
that
on
one
occasion
he
had
gotten
so
mad
he
had
broken
his
knuckles
slamming
his
fist
through
the
wall.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
it
is
not...
it
is
not
impossible
that
a
jury
could
conclude
that.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
but
it
is
also
reasonable
for
mr.
leaphart
to
have
decided,
if
that
testimony
had
been
made
available
to
him,
which
his
testimony,
unrefuted,
was
that
he
did
not
have
it;
but
if
it
had
been
made
available
it
would
not
have
been
unreasonable
for
mr.
leapart
to
adhere
to
his
original
strategy.
but
in
using
this
belated
affidavit
testimony,
in
this
analysis,
the
proper
question
is,
whether
if
you
inject
this
lukewarm
but
still
extremely
potentially
damaging
character
evidence,
does
it
render
the
sentence
imposed...
does
it
create
a
situation
where
it
was
reasonably
likely
that
a
different
sentence
would
have
been
reached
by
this
sentencer.
in
light
of
the
overwhelming
evidence
of
the
sadistic
and
heinous
nature
of
this
crime,
then
the
only
reasonable
answer
is
no.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
he
did,
and
he's
presently
under
the
death
sentence.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
he
is.
and
we're
conducting
evidentiary
proceedings
in
the
district
court
at
this
time.
your
honor,
what
this
court
must
do
is
evaluate
those
circumstances
as
known
to
mr.
leaphart
at
the
time
of
trial.
at
the
time
of
trial,
mr.
leaphart
only
had
this
petitioner
and
his
mother.
and
the
testimony
i
have
detailed
from
the
psychologist
and
the
psychological
evaluations.
mr.
leaphart
travelled
to
hindsville,
where
this
petitioner
was
stationed
at
ft
stewart,
and
he
ascertained
no
favorable
testimony.
which
is
not
unreasonable
when
a
soldier
and
a
fellow
soldier
kidnap,
armed
rob,
sexually
sodomize
and
assault,
and
then
murder
another
soldier.
mr.
leaphart
testified
that
the
only
way
to
get
any
character
evidence
as
far
as
background
was
through
the
petitioner
or
the
petitioner's
mother,
but
it
carried
with
it
substantial
risks
that
outweighed
the
nature
of
that
character
testimony;
which
was
not
an
unreasonable
decision
under
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
this
case.
the
district
court
so
opined,
and
the
eleventh
circuit
so
found,
and
we
ask
that
this
court
concur
in
that
judgment.
in
my
remaining
time,
i'd
like
to
address
the
trial
court's
charge
on
intent.
what
this
petitioner
advocates
before
this
court
is
that
on
reviewing
a
trial
court's
charge,
a
state
trial
court's
charge
for
burden-shifting
effect,
mere
identification
anywhere
in
that
trial
court's
charge
of
the
franklin
language
constitutes
constitutional
error
without
more.
no
consideration
to
the
charge
as
a
whole;
no
consideration
as
to
how
a
reasonable
juror,
hearing
this
charge
in
this
sequence,
the
words
actually
spoken,
in
the
context
of
this
case,
would
have
understood
this
charge.
now,
this
charge
is
different
from
and
constitutionally
distinguishable
from
the
charge
reviewed
in
franklin,
which,
frankly,
it
is
our
contention,
is
a
case
that
should
be
limited
to
its
facts.
it
is
a
fact-specific
application
of
those
principles
enunciated
in
in
re
winship,
and
talked
about
in
sandstrom
v.
montana.
this
jury,
in
a
case
in
which
physical
acts
were
not
at
issue...
there
was
no
contention
here,
because
there
was
a
confession...
this
jury
was
told
that
while
an
individual
can
be
presumed
to
mean...
to
intend
to
do
what
he
usually
does,
under
our
law,
in
order
to
have
a
crime,
there
must
be
a
union
of
act
and
intent.
and
in
this
case,
criminal
intent
is
an
element
that
rests
upon
the
state
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
they
were
told
that
intent
can
never
be
presumed.
it
is
always
a
question
of
fact
to
be
ascertained
by
the
jury.
they
were
told
that
in
resolving
the
issue
of
the
existence
or
nonexistence
of
intent,
you
may
look
to
the
facts
and
circumstances
of
the
case,
including
the
conduct
and
actions
of
the
defendant,
and
from
those
facts,
proven
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
by
the
prosecution,
you
may
infer
intent.
but
they
were
never
told
that
you
had
to
presume
intent
to
kill.
this
jury,
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
knew
that
in
looking
at
the
conduct
of
this
defendant,
christopher
burger,
who
was
the
actual
murderer,
who
shortly
before
the
murder
opened
the
trunk,
asked
the
victim,
hey
man,
you
all
right,
closed
the
trunk,
and
immediately
drove
that
car
into
that
burrow
pit
filled
with
water
after
having
first
wiped
his
fingerprints
to
further
secret
his
identity.
they
were
told
that
from
those
facts,
you
may
infer
that
christopher
burger
had
the
subjective
mens
rea,
the
criminal
intent
to
kill;
but
they
were
never
told
that
you
had
to
presume
it.
so
this
charge
does
not
suffer
from
the
defects
found
to
exist
in
the
case
of
raymond
lee
franklin.
your
honor,
the
position
of
the
respondent
in
this
case
is
that
this
petitioner,
who
was
afforded
ample
opportunity
in
the
district
court
to
make
out
facts
in
support
of
his
constitutional
claims,
never
carried
his
burden.
under
prevailing
constitutional
principles,
he
is
not
entitled
to
federal
habeas
corpus
relief.
those
conclusions
were
reached
by
the
district
court
and
affirmed
by
the
circuit
court.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
this
case
was
remanded
to
the
circuit
court.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
the
circuit
court
at
that
time
had
before
it
the
decision
in
franklin,
not
yet
rose
v.
clark.
the
circuit
court
said,
pretermitting
the
question
of
burden
shifting,
we
will
not
answer
that.
but
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
it
is
apparent
that
this
charge,
if
burden-shifting,
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
your
honor,
i'll
agree,
that
these
facts...
if
this
is
not
a
harmless
error
case,
your
honor,
there
doesn't
exist
one.
i
agree
with
that.
but
i
have
to
also
urge
before
this
court
that
this
charge,
though
the
circuit
court--
mr.
william
b.
hill,
jr.
--yes,
that's
right,
your
honor.
it
is
not
a
burden-shifting
charge.
and
so
we
ask
that
this
court
affirm
the
denial
of
habeas
corpus
relief
to
this
petitioner.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
that
concludes
my
presentation,
your
honors.
thank
you.
