mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
time
of
the
offense
chris
burger
and
his
older
co-indictee
were
privates
in
the
united
states
army
stationed
at
ft
stewart,
georgia.
they
were
drinking
heavily
at
a
club
on
base,
and
when
they
ran
out
of
money,
the
co-indictee
devised
a
plan
where
they
would
rob
a
cab
driver
to
obtain
some
more
money.
the
cab
was
called
out
to
the
base,
and
after
riding
with
the
cab
driver
for
awhile,
on
a
prearranged
signal,
the
robbery
was
accomplished.
after
the
robbery
was
accomplished,
the
co-indictee
forced
the
cab
driver
into
the
back
seat
of
the
cab
where
he
sexually
assaulted
him,
and
the
cab
driver
was
forced
by
the
co-indictee
into
the
trunk
of
the
cab.
chris
and
the
co-indictee
continued
driving
to
the
savannah,
georgia
airport,
where
they
went
to
pick
up
a
fellow
soldier
who
was
flying
home...
was
flying
back
to
the
base
from
his
home.
this
fellow
soldier
is
the
only
uninvolved
eye
witness
to
any
of
the
incidents
which
occurred
that
night.
this
fellow
soldier
testified
that
during
the
ride
from
the
savannah,
georgia
airport
back
to
the
base,
the
co-indictee
was
essentially
gloating
and
bragging
about
the
crime,
while
chris
essentially
was
driving
the
cab
silently,
occasionally
agreeing
with
some
of
the
statements
that
the
co-indictee
was
making.
when
the
co-indictee
during
the
drive
suggested
that
they
should
kill
the
cab
driver,
chris
argued
against
this
and
said
that
they
should
just
release
the
cab
driver
and
get
rid
of
the
cab.
after
the...
after
the
fellow
soldier
was
dropped
off
at
the
base,
they
continued
riding
in
the
cab
for
a
period
of
time,
and
then
the
co-indictee
directed
chris
to
drive
the
cab
to
an
area
in
the
woods
in
rural
wayne
county,
georgia,
that
both
he
and
chris
were
familiar
with.
the
cab
was
parked
at
a
pond
at...
in
the
woods.
the
co-indictee
then
removed
the
cb
radio
from
the
front
of
the
cab,
and
taking
the
cb
radio
to
dispose
of
it
in
some
bushes.
during
this
time,
chris
opened
up
the
trunk
of
the
cab
and
asked
the
cab
driver
if
he
was
all
right.
after
receiving
an
affirmative
reply,
he
closed
the
trunk
of
the
cab.
by
this
time,
the
co-indictee
had
returned
to
the
cab
and
chris
began
to
walk
away,
and
the
co-indictee
asked
him,
where
are
you
going?
and
chris
said,
we're
leaving
now,
aren't
we?
and
the
co-indictee
said,
no,
we've
got
to
get
rid
of
the
cab,
and
directed
chris
to
drive
the
cab
into
the
water,
which
he
did,
resulting
in
the
death
of
the
cab
driver.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
he...
as
chris
was
starting
to
walk
away,
the
co-indictee
said,
we
have
to
get
rid
of
the
cab.
and
he
told
chris,
you
drive
the
cab
into
the
lake,
which
he
did.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
he
was
an
older
person.
they
were
both
privates
in
the
army.
the
order
in
which
i'd
like
to
address
the
issues
before
this
court
is
the
failure
of
chris'
trial
counsel
to
conduct
reasonable
investigation,
a
reasonable
inquiry
for
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial;
then
the
pervasive
conflict
of
interest
that
existed
in
this
case;
and
then
the
burden-shifting
jury
instruction
on
malice
and
intent
that
was
given
at
the
guilt-innocence
phase
of
the
trial.
the
most
important
consideration
in
the
death
sentence
which
chris
received
in
this
case
is
that
this
death
sentence
is
not
reliable
as
society's
reasoned
moral
response
to
chris'
individualized
background.
chris
was
twice
tried
in
wayne
county,
georgia.
after
the
first
trial,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
affirmed
the
conviction
but
reversed
the
death
sentence,
sending
the
case
back
for
retrial
solely
on
the
issue
of
sentencing,
and
he
was
again
sentenced
to
death.
at
both
of
these
trials,
the
jury
had
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
the
individualized
characteristics
of
chris
or
his
background
other
than
the
state's
version
of
the
crime
for
which
he
was
convicted.
they
knew
only
the
crime
that
was
committed
they
did
not
know
the
person
they
were
sentencing.
in
making
what
this
court
has
referred
to
as
the
unique,
difficult,
individualized,
subjective
decision
which
the
jury
must
make
at
sentencing,
this
difficult
decision
was
rendered
impossible
by
the
fact
that
they
had
absolutely
no
knowledge
of
the
background
of
the
person
they
were
sentencing.
there's
a
wealth
of
information
that
a
reasonably
informed
attorney
would
want
to
have
presented
before
the
jury.
there's
a
wealth
of
information
that
a
reasonably
informed
attorney
would
have
wanted
to
consider
as
potential
mitigating
circumstances
to
be
presented
at
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial.
some
of
these
potential
mitigating
circumstances,
which
a
reasonably
informed
attorney
would
have
wanted
to
have
presented,
were
established
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
in
this
case.
chris
had
absolutely
no
prior
record.
he
was
17
years
old
at
the
time
of
the
offense.
but
more
than
just
his
chronological
age,
he
had
an
iq
in
the
lower
10
percent
of
the
population.
he
was
suffering
from
brain
damage,
most
probably
caused
by
blows
to
his
head
when
he
was
young.
he
was
functioning
at
the
mental
level
of
a
12-year-old
child.
chris
was
the
offspring
of
a
teenage
marriage--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--yes.
he
was
the
offspring
of
a
teenage
marriage,
and
his
family...
and
his
parents
were
divorced
when
he
was
very
young.
he
spent
the
rest
of
his
youth
being
kicked
back
and
forth
between
two
parents
who
wanted
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
him.
his
father
would
not
want
him
to
live
with
him.
he'd
throw
him
out
of
the
house,
send
him
to
live
with
his
mother,
who
also
wanted
to
have
nothing
to
do
with
him.
and
as
soon
as
the
opportunity
arose,
she'd
kick
him
out
of
the
house
and
send
him
back
to
live
with
his
natural
father.
he
was
physically
and
psychologically
abused
by
his
natural
father,
and
when
he
came
back
to
living
with
his
mother
and
with
a
stepfather,
this
stepfather
introduced
him
to
drug
abuse
and
alcohol
abuse
at
the
age
of
11.
he
was
physically
beaten
by
this
stepfather,
and
his
mother
was
also
physically
beaten
by
the
stepfather.
when
he
tried
to
intervene
in
the
beatings
that
his
mother
was
receiving
at
the
hands
of
his
stepfather,
he
would
be
beaten
for
trying
to
intervene.
chris
was
then
sent
back
to
live
with
his
natural
father.
and
because
of
the
physical
abuse
he
was
suffering
there,
he
ran
away
from
home,
trying
to
hitchhike
to
florida
to
live
with
his
mother
who
had
moved
to
florida.
after
hitchhiking
from
indiana
to
florida
and
arriving
in
florida
broke
at
his
mother's
home,
she
told
him
he
wasn't
wanted
and
threw
him
out
of
the
house
and
sent
his
back
again
to
live
with
his
natural
father,
who
also
locked
him
out
of
the
house.
so
for
the
last
few
months
before
his
enlistment
in
the
army,
he
was
forced
to
live
with
a
neighbor
who
took
him
in
because
he
had
nowhere
else
to
go.
not
one
word
of
this
individualized
background
of
chris
was
heard
by
either
one
of
the
juries
that
sentenced
him
to
death.
under
the...
the
death
penalty
scheme
in
georgia,
only
one
juror
is
required
to
impose
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
if
one
juror
had
been
persuaded
by
the
mitigating
evidence
in
this
case,
chris
would
have
received...
if
one
reasonable
fact-finder
on
that
jury
had
been
persuaded...
chris
would
have
received
a
sentence
of
life
imprisonment.
this
is
not
a
case
of
second
guessing
some
strategic
or
tactical
decision
that
was
made
by
his
trial
attorney.
this
is,
rather,
a
case
where
the
trial
attorney
made
absolutely
no
effort
to
become
reasonably
informed
about
chris'
background.
the
trial
attorney
in
his--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
justice
powell,
at
the
time
that
he
was
enlisted
into
the
army,
this
was
in
the
early
years
of
the
all-volunteer
army.
and
i
think
it's
pretty
well
known
that
they
were
fudging
a
lot
on
their
enlistment
quotas,
because
of
the...
the
enlistment
quotas
they
had,
they
were
fudging
a
lot
on
the
qualifications
of
the
people
they
were
accepting.
he
was
a
10th
grade
dropout
with
an
iq
of
82.
i
don't
understand
how
he
could
have
been
allowed
into
the
army.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
they
knew
that
he
was
17.
they
did
not
know
anything
about
his
mental
impairment,
and
they
didn't
know
that
he
had
an
iq
of
only
82.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
the
counsel
at
trial
never
made
that
argument,
either
at
trial
or
on
appeal.
the
post-conviction
in
this
case...
the
state
post-conviction
in
this
case
was
handled
by
an
attorney
who
was
recruited
by
a
lay
person
from
the
aclu
in
georgia.
this
attorney...
the
state
of
georgia
provides
absolutely
no
provision
for
the
appointment
of
counsel
in
state
post-conviction.
this
attorney
had
just
passed
the
georgia
bar
exam,
and
had
not
even
established
an
office;
was
basically
operating
out
of
his
home,
and
knew
nothing
of
the
constitutional
jurisprudence
before
this
court,
and
did
not
raise
it
in
state
habeas
corpus,
so
it's
never
been
exhausted
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
no.
it
was
not
exhausted
in
the
state
courts
and
was-not
raised.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
that's
correct,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that's
what
i
can
only
best
refer
to
as
the
monster
in
the
closet
theory
that
the
attorney
used
in
trying
this
case.
he
kept
at
the
federal
evidentiary
hearing
inking
vague
references
to
trouble
that
christopher
burger
had
been
in,
that
there
was
some
sort
of
trouble
in
his
background
that
would
come
out
before
the
jury
if
he
attempted
to
put
in
this
evidence
of
his
background.
the
only
trouble
chris
has
ever
been
in
is
that
he
was
adjudicated
a
delinquent
for
the
status
offense
of
being
a
runaway
and
for
being
truant
at
school,
which
certainly
under
the
facts
of
his
background,
is
more
mitigating
than
aggravating
in
the
cases
far
more
mitigating.
there
is
nothing
in
terms
of
criminal
convictions
or
anything
else
like
that
in
his
background
that
would
have
been
presented
had
this
evidence
put
on.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
there's
nothing
to
indicate
that.
and
he...
the
lawyer
testified
about
the
investigation
he
did
for
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial.
and
to
begin
with,
he
never
even
contacted
chris'
mother.
she
had
to
contact
him.
and
the
only
way
she
found
out
that
her
son
was
charged
with
murder
and
was
about
to
face
trial
in
georgia
was
that
she
got
a
phone
call
from
a
relative
in
indiana
who
read
about
it
in
an
indianapolis
newspaper.
and
she
went
to
wayne
county,
georgia.
and
this
was
just
three
days
before
the
trial
was
scheduled.
the
lawyer
was
perfectly
willing
to
go
to
trial
at
that
time
without
ever
even
spoken
to
anyone
about
chris'
background.
and
then
when
he
finally
did
get
around
to
speaking
with
her,
he
testified
that
he
never
explained
the
penalty
phase
of
trial
to
her,
and
never
told
her
what
type
of
evidence
could
be
presented
in
mitigation.
he
had
no
way
of
drawing
from
her
this
information
about
the
background--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--a
total
of
about
five,
if
the
time
records
are
to
be
accepted.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
this
is
very
significant.
he
testified
that
he
spoke
with
chris
about
the
penalty
phase
of
trial.
but
when
he
was
asked,
what
did
you
tell
chris
about
the
penalty
phase
of
trial,
he
said,
i
told
him
that
we
could
present
evidence
of,
quote,
something
good
about
you.
now,
a
lay
person
would
not
understand
something
good
about
you
means
that
you
have
an
iq
of
82,
that
you're
brain
damaged,
that
you
came
from
this
horrible
background
of
child
abuse
and
neglect.
certainly
the
average
lay
person
wouldn't
understand
that
to
mean,
something
good.
a
17-year-old
of
very
low
mentality
couldn't
be
expected
to
understand
when
he
was
asked,
tell
me
something
good
about
you,
that
that
meant
all
of
this
terrible
information
that's
in
chris'
background.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
he
apparently
didn't
know.
i
don't
even
think
the
word
"apparently"
would
be
correct.
he
didn't
know
it,
because
he
testified
at
the
habeas
hearing,
all
i
could
see
to
put
on
would
be
to
put
on
a
mother
expressing
her
love
for
her
child,
and
i
couldn't
see
any
good
in
presenting
that.
and
what
could
he
say,
that
he
was
a
quote
good
boy
who
went
to
church?
if
he
had
known
anything
about
the
background,
he'd
know
that
that
wasn't
the
type
of
mitigation
that
we're
talking
about,
a
quote
good
boy
who
went
to
church.
but
we're
talking
about
this
terrible
background
of
child
abuse
and
mental-deficiency
from
which
chris
came.
an
important
factor
of
this
is
that
after
the
original
death
sentence
was
reversed
by
the
supreme
court
of
georgia,
the
case
was
remanded
for
retrial,
solely
on
the
issue
of
sentencing.
and
it
was
remanded
in
september,
and
the
case
was
not
retried
until
july
of
the
following
year.
so
the
attorney,
knowing
that
all
considerations
of
guilt-innocence
were
gone
now,
the
supreme
court
of
georgia
had
affirmed
the
conviction,
and
knowing
the
case
was
coming
back
solely
on
the
issue
of
sentencing,
and
having
nine
months
to
prepare
for
it,
he
testified
that
during
that
nine
months
he
conducted
no
investigation
for
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial;
that
during
that
nine
months
he
interviewed
no
witnesses
for
the
sentencing
phase
of
trial;
he
testified
that
he
simply
opened
up
his
file,
reviewed
the
file,
and
decided
to
try
the
case
the
same
way
he
had
before,
which
he
knew
had
failed
the
first
time
he'd
tried
it.
exacerbating
this
problem
of
the
failure
of
the
counsel
to
conduct
any
sort
of
reasonable
inquiry
for
sentencing
in
this
case
is
the
pervasive
conflict
of
interest
that
existed
in
this
case.
the
law
firm
of...
the
two-partner
law
firm,
the
law
partner
leaphart
and
the
law
partner
smith,
were
appointed
to
represent
the
two
co-indictees
in
the
case.
although
the
formal
appointment
was,
law
partner
leaphart
to
represent
chris,
and
law
partner
smith
to
represent
the
co-indictee,
in
reality
they
took
it
as
a
law
firm
effort.
they
both...
both
law
partners
conducted
attorney-client
interviews
with
both
of
the
clients.
the
law
partners
researched
the
law
together.
they
made
preparations
for
the
case
together.
they
discussed
the
strategies
of
the
case
together.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
okay.
chris'
guilt-innocence
trial
was
tried
first,
and
then
the
co-indictee's
guilt-innocence
trial.
they
were
reversed
on
appeal,
and
when
it
came
back
to
wayne
county,
chris'
penalty
trial
was
tried
first,
and
the
co-indictee's
penalty
trial
was
tried
second.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
that's
correct.
i
think...
i
think
something's
very
significant
about
that
is
that
these
cases-were
tried
in
a
very
small
tightly-knit
rural
community
in
southeast
georgia,
wayne
county,
a
community
of
slightly
over
17,000
persons.
and
the
attorney
testified
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
everybody
in
the
county
knows
what
everyone
else
is
doing.
he
testified
that
these
cases
were
well
publicized,
well
known,
in
this
community;
and
that
there's
no
way
you
could
keep
a
secret.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
there
are
two
different...
two
important
factors
about
that.
the
first
is
that
in
this
small
community,
an
attorney's
integrity
and
credibility
in
a
small
community
is
extremely
important,
much
more
important
than,
say,
an
attorney
in
a
large
community
who
can
be
anonymous
before
a
jury.
especially
by
the
time
of
the
second
set
of
trials,
there's
no
way
that
this
community
wouldn't...
couldn't
know
that
the
law
partners
were
representing
the
two
co-indictees,
and
representing
them
on
exactly
opposite
defenses.
and
the
defenses
were
exactly
opposite.
chris'
defense,
which
was
supported
by
the
testimony
of
the
eyewitness
who
rode
with
them
in
the
cab
for
awhile,
was
that
he
was
the
less
culpable
party,
and
that
the
co-indictee
was
the
one
taking
the
dominant
role
in
this.
the
co-indictee's
defense
was
the
exact
opposite.
his
defense
was
that
he
did
not
know
that
chris
was
going
to
drive
the
cab
into
the
pond,
and
that
he
tried
to
stop...
that
he
tried
to
talk
chris
out
of
doing
it.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
he
put
on
the
defense,
to
an
extent,
but
he
would
have
no
credibility
in
this
small
town.
he
testified
the
reason
he
didn't
move
for
a
change
of
venue--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--but
at
the
second
trial...
it
came
first,
but
that
doesn't
mean
the
community
didn't
know
that's
what
the
defenses
were
at
the
first
trial.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
but
certainly
by
the
second
trial.
because
this
was
a
very
well
known
event
in
that
community.
he
testified
the
reason
he
didn't
move
for
a
change
of
venue
is
because
if
he
moved
for
a
change
of
venue,
he
knew
there
was
no
way
he
could
have
kept
it
secret
from
the
community
because
everybody
knows
everything
there,
and
that
they
would
have
held
it
against
him
for
moving
for
one.
and
then
certainly
by
the
second
trial,
everybody
in
the
community
by
that
time,
he
testified
there
was
general
knowledge
in
the
community
that
the
case
was
being
retried.
everybody
would
have
known
what
was
going...
what
had
gone
on
the
first
time.
and
the
second
factor
is
that
although
the
lawyer
testified
that
he
attempted
to
plea
bargain
the
case,
and
approached
the
district
attorney
more
than
once
attempting
to
plea
bargain
the
case.
he
never
offered
the
most
important
thing
he
had
to
offer
in
the
plea
bargain.
he
never
offered
the
testimony
of
his
client
against
the
co-indictee
in
exchange
for
a
life
sentence.
and
he
couldn't
do
that
because
they
were...
because
he
had
some
duty
to
protect
the
co-indictee
at
the
same
time
with
his
law
partner.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
i
think
the
prosecutor
would
not
have
had
any
trouble
accepting
a
deal
for
a
17-year-old.
that
would
not
be
a
problem.
and
i
don't
know
any
district
attorney
who
doesn't
want
to
present
a
case
with
that...
without
an
eyewitness
there.
he
had
to
present
both
cases
without
eyewitness
testimony
of
what
actually
happened.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
up
until
the
point
where--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--yes.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
i'm
certainly
not
going
to
argue--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--i'm
certainly
not
going
to
argue,
justice
scalia,
that
it's
not
a
strong
case.
i
just
think--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--most
capital
cases
are
plea
bargained,
and
it
generally
doesn't
have
a
whole
lot
to
do
with
the
strength
of
the
case.
and
it
would
have...
and
i
don't
know
a
district
attorney
who
doesn't
want
to
have
an
eyewitness
anyway,
no
matter
how
strong
the
case,
who
doesn't
want
to
have
an
eyewitness
at
the
time
of
the
commission
of
the
crime.
and
the
most
important
thing
is,
he
never
offered
it.
he
never
offered
it,
and
he
couldn't
offer
it
because
he
and
his
law
partner
had
an
obligation
to
the
co-indictee
too
which
created
this
conflict
of
interest.
in
the--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--he
made
those
conclusory
statements
in
his
testimony,
that
yes,
i
would
have
crucified
stevens
had
i
had
the
opportunity
to
do
so.
i
think
as
this
court
noted
in
wood
v.
georgia,
an
attorney
suffering
under
a
conflict
of
interest
is
not
going
to
concede
that
he
acted
improperly.
i
think
his
actions
speak
louder
than
his
testimony.
and
his
action
was,
he
never
offered
the
one
thing
he
had...
the
most...
the
strongest
point
he
had
to
offer
in
terms
of
plea
bargain,
which
was
his
client's
testimony
against
the
co-indictee.
and
it's
important
that
chris
was
never
informed
about
this
conflict
of
interest.
the
circumstances
of
the
appointment
weren't
that
he
was
brought
into
court
formally
and
appointed
the
counsel.
and
like
what
happens
under
rule
44(c)
in
the
federal
procedures,
he
was
informed
of
the
possibility
of
the
conflict.
the
way
the
appointment
occurred
in
this
case
is
that
the...
is
that
the
appointing
judge
called
up
the
clerk
of
court
in
an
ex
parte
communication...
conversation,
and
told
the
clerk
of
court
to
call
the
law
partners
and
tell
them
they
had
been
appointed.
so
the
clerk
of
court
then
called
the
law
partners,
telling
them
they
had
been
appointed,
and
at
no
time
was
chris
brought
into
this
process,
or
any
inquiry
was
made
of
him
whether
there
was
a
problem
with
this
for
him,
or
whether
it...
it
wasn't
told--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--i'm
not
arguing
that
it's
constitutionally
required
to
have
consultation
with
the
client
before
the
appointment
of
counsel
is
made.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
circumstances
of
this
appointment
made
it
impossible
for
the
court
to
inquire
as
to
the
problem
with
the
conflict
of
interest.
there
was
no
inquiry
made,
and
more
importantly,
there
was
no
telling
chris
that
there
might
have
been
a
problem
of
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
in
a
capital
case--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--i
don't
think
the
court
needs
to
go
that
far
in
this
case,
but
yes,
i
believe
there
should
be
a
flat
rule
against
appointing
law
partners
in
a--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--they
couldn't
work
together,
because
the
interest
was
so
divergent
in
the
two
cases.
they
had
the
greatest
adversity
of
interest
you
could
ever
possibly
have
in
a
criminal
case,
each
blaming
the
other.
there's
no
way.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
that
potential
is
almost
always
there,
but--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--that
potential
is
almost
always
there,
but
that
doesn't
actually
occur
in
every
case.
and
in
this
case,
it
actually
occurred,
and
it
was
known
very
early
that
it
actually
occurred.
and
there's
the
problem
that
this
court
address
in
tyler
v.
sullivan
that
a
trial
judge
is
supposed
to
make
inquiry
when
it
becomes
obvious
to
him
that
there
may
be
a
conflict
of
interest.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
the
fact--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--he
made...
he
made--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--he
made
that
argument,
but
he
couldn't
have
made
that
argument
with
any
credibility.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
because
at
the
time
of
the
second
sentencing
trial,
of
the
36
jurors
that
the
record
reflects
responses
for,
23
answered
that
they
knew
about
this
case.
and
he
conducted
no
further
voir
dire
of
them
to
find
out
if
they
knew...
what
they
knew
about
the
case
was
that
they
had
conflicting
defenses;
that
they
knew
the
law
partners
were
representing
the
two
opposite
clients;
none
of
this
was
done.
and
this
is
in
a--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--yes,
i
think--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--if
they
think
it's
two
unrelated
lawyers,
they
can
sit
there
and
judge
out,
now
which
one
do
we
believe
from
the
evidence
we've
heard.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
when
there's
two
law
partners--
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
--pardon?
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
that's
right.
but
when
you're
dealing
with
two
law
partners,
they
have
to
conclude
the
law
firm
is
pulling
a
charade
on
us.
the
law
firm
is
just...
just,
you
know,
making
a
joke
out
of
this.
they're
going
in
and
arguing,
whoever
is
not
on
trial
happens
to
be
the
most
culpable
person.
mr.
joseph
m.
nursey
i
think
if
they
knew
that
it
was
people
who
were
related
and
working
together,
they'd
look
at
as,
the
law
firm
is
lying
to
us.
further
unreliability
in
the
fact-finding
process
was
created
by
the
jury
instruction,
the
burden-shifting
jury
instruction
on
the
essential
elements
of
malice
and
intent.
this
is
the
virtually
identical
instruction
to
the
one
that
was
condemned
by
this
court
in
francis
v.
franklin.
the
essence
of
the
defense
being
lesser
culpability,
and
that
chris
was
under
the
direction
and
domination
of
his
co-indictee.
the
important
thing
that
the
jury
had
to
decide
in
making
a
decision
whether
the
requisite
malice
and
intent
existed
was
not
determining
whether
the
intent
was
formulated
by
some
30-year-old
adult,
but
whether
or
not
the
intent...
the...
the
requisite
intent
was
formulated
by
a
17-year-old
operating
at
the
thought
processes
of
a
12-year-old.
and
this
decision
about
chris'
formulation
of
intent
was
taken
away
from
the
jury
by
an
instruction
that
told
them
that
they
are
to
presume
that
malice
and
intent
exists
from
the
natural
and
probable
consequences
of
any
life-threatening
acts
which
chris
may
have
committed.
after
furman
v.
georgia,
the
georgia
legislature
enacted
a
bifurcated
system
for
capital
trials,
establishing
a
sentencing
phase
where
a
complete
portrait
of
the
person
to
be
sentenced
is
presented.
especially
in
the
case
of
a
17-year-old,
we
want
to
be
certain
that
the
fact-finders
on
the
jury
make
the
sentencing
determination
with
adequate
knowledge.
chris
was
alive
about
6,000
days
at
the
time
of
this
offense;
had
lived
about
6,000
days
at
the
time
of
this
offense.
but
the
jury's
entire
knowledge
of
his
background,
their
entire
knowledge
of
his
background
consisted
of
the
state's
version
of
a
few
hours
of
one
day
of
this
life.
and
the
reason
that
was
the
state's
entire
knowledge
of
his
background
was
because
he
was
not
provided
with
the
counsel
which
our
constitution
requires.
the
death
sentence
in
this
case
is
not
reliable.
we
cannot
be...
we
cannot
feel
comfortable
saying
that
it
reflects
the
reasoned
moral
judgment
of
the
people
of
wayne
county
under
the
circumstances
under
which
it
occurred.
and
for
that
reason,
the
death
sentence
in
this
case
should
be
vacated.
