mr.
nursey?
justice
scalia
how
would
this
information
have
gotten
to
the
jury?
i
mean,
what
witnesses
would
have
had
to
be
put
on?
i
gather
than
one
of
the
arguments
made
by
the
attorney
was
that
his
reason
for
not
putting
it
on,
at
least
that
portion
of
it
that
he
knew,
was
that
he
was
worried
that
the
cross-examination
would
do
more
harm
than
the
direct
testimony
would
do
good.
now,
how
would
he
gotten
it
on?
he
would
have
put
the
mother
on--
justice
scalia
--are
was
sure
about
that?
i
mean,
is
that
the
only
thing
that
the
lawyer
had
in
mind?
i
mean,
might
there
have
been
some
other
testimony
that
he
expected
from
the
mother
that
we
don't
know
about?
justice
scalia
well,
he
had
talked
to
chris
about
it
for,
what,
about
six
hours
in
all?
justice
scalia
and
was
all
of
this
information
volunteered
by
your
client?
did
the
lawyer
have
reason
to
know?
justice
scalia
so
we
don't
know
that
the
lawyer
knew
all
of
this
that
you're
telling
us
and
didn't
put
it
on?
justice
scalia
how
were
they
tried?
what
order
were
they
tried
in?
who
was
tried
first?
justice
scalia
so
both
for
the
guilt
phase
and
the
penalty
phase,
your
client
came
first?
justice
scalia
well,
you
have
to
rely
on
that,
don't
you?
because
there's
nothing
that
could
have
been
said,
so
long
as
they're
not
being
tried
together,
there's
no
reason
why
one
lawyer
wouldn't
put
on
everything
in
your
client's
defense
that
he
had
available.
because
it
couldn't
possibly...
it
couldn't
possibly
hurt
the
other
defendant;
he's
not
being
tried
at
the
same
time.
be
a
totally
different
jury.
justice
scalia
well,
doesn't
that
cut
against
your
argument?
i
mean,
i
could
understand
your
argument
that
a
conflict
of
interest
had
affected
the
case
if
that
defense
hadn't
been
put
on.
but
in
fact
you're
telling
me
that
he
put
on
the
defense
which
you...
which
you
now
argue
conflict
of
interest
would
have
induced
him
not
to
put
on?
justice
scalia
he
came
first.
it
didn't
matter.
justice
scalia
how
could
they
know
it?
justice
scalia
well,
now
wait,
he
had
an
eyewitness
who
was
riding
in
the
car.
justice
scalia
right.
justice
scalia
that's
right.
an
eyewitness,
the
fellow
they
picked
up
at
the
airport
who
knew
the
fellow
was
in
the
trunk.
they
told
him
that
the
fellow
was
in
the
trunk.
in
fact,
they
called
back
to
him,
how
you're
doing,
while
he
was
in
the
car.
and
later
that
same
car
is
found
in
the
bottom
of
a
pond.
and
you
think
that
isn't
a
strong
case?
justice
scalia
with
the
fellow
still
in
the
trunk.
justice
scalia
do
you
think
there
was
any
chance
that
you'd
take
a
plea
bargain
in
order
to
get
additional...
additional
evidence
of
whether
they
committed
the
crime
or
not?
justice
scalia
that
is
to
say,
this
lawyer
relied
on
the
fact
that
his
client
had
not
done
as
much
as
the
other
defendant,
which
you
would
think
the
conflict
of
interest,
if
that's
what
he
was
worried
about,
he
wouldn't
have
made
that
argument.
he
would
have
tried
to
rely
on
the
other
things
that
you
tell
us
he
should
have
relied
on,
namely
this--
justice
scalia
--fellow
came
from
a
bad
background
and
all
of
that.
justice
scalia
i
don't
understand
why
you
say
that.
that
i
don't
understand.
he
couldn't
have
made
it
with
any
credibility?
justice
scalia
you
think
it'd
make
a
difference
to
the
jury
that
they
knew
it
was
two
partners
in
the
same
firm
who
were
making
inconsistent
arguments,
as
opposed
to
two
different
lawyers?
justice
scalia
suppose
they
had
known
that--
justice
scalia
--right.
justice
scalia
they'd
still
have
to
say
one
of
them's
lying.
justice
scalia
i
mean,
they'd
still
have
to
conclude,
one
of
them
is
wrong,
or
one
of
them
is
lying.
justice
scalia
yes,
but
insofar
as
your
client
is
concerned,
the
only
conclusion
that
is
relevant
is
that
one
of
them
is
lying,
and
that's
the
same
conclusion
that
the
jury
would
draw,
whether
they
were
partners
from
the
same
firm
or
not.
justice
scalia
well,
it
would
have
been...
you
say
he
tried
to
engage
in
plea
negotiations
after
the...
after
the
overturning
of
the
first
death
sentence.
justice
scalia
but
by
that
time
the
district
attorney
has
the
conviction
in
his
pocket.
justice
scalia
were
both
death
sentences
reversed
on
appeal?
justice
scalia
so
he
could
have
offered
his
testimony
on
the
penalty
phase?
could
he
have
offered
his
testimony?
justice
scalia
xxx
burger's
confession
introduced
against
the
other
defendant?
justice
scalia
so
that's
why
he'd
want
it.
