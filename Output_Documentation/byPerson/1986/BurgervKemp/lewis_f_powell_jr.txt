counsel,
may
i
ask
this
question?
justice
jr.
how
did
your
client,
mr.
burger,
get
into
the
united
states
army
if
his
mental
capacity
was
that
of
a
12-year-old
child?
justice
jr.
did
the
jury
at
the
sentencing
hearing
know
the
age
of
the
defendant?
justice
jr.
did
counsel
argue
at
that
time,
or
has
it
been
argued
at
anytime
since,
that
it's
unconstitutional
to
impose
a
death
sentence
on
a
minor?
justice
jr.
so
it's
never
been
raised?
