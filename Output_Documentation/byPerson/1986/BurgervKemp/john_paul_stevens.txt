justice
stevens
you
say
he
couldn't
have
offered
it,
but
he
testified
to
the
contrary,
didn't
he?
the
lawyer
testified,
if
crucifying
stevens
would
have
helped
burger,
would
you
have
done
it?
yes,
sir.
so
he...
he...
his
testimony
indicated
he
was
not...
did
not
feel
himself
under
any
inhibition
by
reason
of
the
conflict.
justice
stevens
but
mr.
nursey,
do
you
think
there's
a
flat
rule
against
appointing
two
law
partners
to
represent
co-defendants
in
a
case
like
this?
justice
stevens
i
mean,
are
you
asking
us...
maybe
that's
what
you
want
us
to
do
in
this
case,
is
hold
there
is
a
per
se
rule.
justice
stevens
because
if
you
don't
have
a
flat
rule,
i
don't
know
what
good
it
would
do
to
talk
to
this
not
very
intelligent
young
man
about
whether
he
sees
any
problems
of
conflict
of
interest
in
appointing
two
law
partners.
i
think
he
might
well
think
that
they'd
probably
be
able
to
work
together
and
save
some
time
on
the
law
and
it
might
work
out
better.
i
mean,
i
don't
know
how
he
could
judge
that
very
well.
justice
stevens
but
isn't
that
potential
almost
always
there
where
you
have
two
accomplices
in
this
kind
of
a
transaction?
i
mean--
justice
stevens
--it's
fairly
obvious
that
one
is
going
to
say,
the
other
was
more
to
blame
than
i,
or
something
like
that.
justice
stevens
but
in
fact
what
you're
complaining
about
is
that
that
defense
was
made
which
is
precisely
the
defense
that
you
claim
a
conflict
of
interest
would
induce
not
to
be
made;
and
that
that
defense
was
not
made
which
a
conflict
of
interest
would
have
caused
to
be
used
instead.
justice
stevens
mr.
hill,
can
i
interrupt
you
for
just
a
second?
maybe
neither
the
petitioner
nor
his
mother
had
the
names,
but
there
was
this
psychologist
who...
or
psychiatrist
who
interviewed
the
petitioner
at
some
length.
surely
some
of
this
background
must
have
been
discussed
there,
and
wasn't
he
a
potential
source
of
information?
justice
stevens
but
did
he
use
the
words,
"anything
good
about
you"?
justice
stevens
so
your
position
is
that
leaphart
had
all
this
information
and
elected
not
to
use
it.
your
opponent
seems
to
suggest
he
didn't
even
have
the
information.
justice
stevens
well,
did
he
have
information
that
your
opponent
opened
his
argument...
he
spent
about
three
or
four
minutes
describing
his
very
difficult
background
as
a
young
man.
justice
stevens
was
that
information
known
to
leaphart?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
just...
did
his
co-indictee
also
get
the
death
penalty
on
the
retrial?
