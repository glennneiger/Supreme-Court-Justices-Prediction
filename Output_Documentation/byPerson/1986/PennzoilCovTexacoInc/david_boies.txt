mr.
david
boies
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
with
just
a
few
moments
of
the
facts
of
how
we
got
here.
a
judgment
was
entered
in
the
texas
court
for
$10.5
billion.
at
the
time
that
judgment
was
entered,
at
the
time
that
we
had
the
proceeding
in
federal
court,
and
indeed
today,
i
think
it
is
common
ground
that,
as
the
court
of
appeals
said,
there
is
no
serious
dispute
that,
should
texaco
be
required
to
liquidate
its
substantial
assets,
it
would
be
able
to
pay
pennzoil's
judgment
in
full.
that
was
not
only
the
conclusion
of
the
courts
below;
it
is
what
pennzoil
has
said,
and
said
repeatedly.
as
supplemental
finding
137
of
the
district
court's
findings
indicates,
pennzoil
has
repeatedly
said
two
things:
one,
that
texaco's
net
assets
are
approximately
twice
the
amount
necessary
to
satisfy
the
pennzoil
judgment;
and
second,
that
pennzoil
itself,
as
is
set
forth
in
pennzoil's
own
words
in
supplemental
finding
137,
does
not
have
any
doubt
that
if
that
judgment
is
ultimately
affirmed
it
will
be
collectible
from
texaco.
and
indeed,
as
is
indicated
in
the
briefs,
pennzoil
in
the
texas
courts
as
late
as
last
july,
when
we
were
arguing
the
appeal
from
the
texas
trial
court
judgment,
again
said
that
texaco's
assets
were
more
than
enough
to
satisfy
the
judgment.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
it
does.
yes,
it
does,
justice
white.
this
is
part
of
the
basis
for
the
lower
court's
conclusion
that
there
was
at
least
fair
grounds
to
litigate,
since
it
was
the
preliminary
injunction
standard
that
was
applied,
that
there
was
a
due
process
problem.
mr.
david
boies
justice
o'connor,
i
think
it
does
answer
the
priority
issue,
because
under
texas
law
the
reason
for
the
priority
is
to
assure
collectibility.
that
is,
a
judgment
winner
deserves
priority
in
order
to
assure
that
he
will
be
able
to
collect
that
judgment
ahead
of
other
potential
creditors.
here
there
are
two
points
that
i'd
urge
the
court
to
keep
in
mind.
the
first
is
that
as
long
as
it
is
clear,
as
the
amount
of
assets
and
pennzoil's
own
statements
indicate
is
the
case,
that
there
is
enough
money
there
for
it
to
be
collectible,
priority
is
not
really
a
consideration.
second,
in
this
particular
case,
because
if
the
judgment
was
executed
on
or
if
the
lien
were
to
be
attached
it
would
be
the
case,
as
the
district
court
found,
that
texaco
would
be
placed
into
bankruptcy,
though
priority
wouldn't
occur
because
texaco
would
just
be
an
unsecured
creditor,
the
only
assumption
that
you
could
have
for
priority
would
be
somehow
texaco
and
texaco's
other
creditors
would
allow
those
liens
to
be
attached
or
allow
the
judgment
to
be
executed
without
going
into
chapter
11.
and
as
the
court
below
found,
that
simply
wasn't
in
accord
with
the
facts.
so
that
there
is
no
priority,
no
meaningful
priority,
that
could
be
achieved
or
was
needed
to
be
achieved
in
order
to
achieve
the
purpose
of
the
texas
statutes
of
bond
and
liens,
which
is
protecting
the
collectibility
of
the
judgment.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor.
if
you
have
a
situation
in
which
there
were
multiple
$10
billion
judgments
against
texaco,
there
would
come
a
point
when
texaco's
assets
would
not
be
sufficient
to
satisfy
them.
that
point
was
never
raised
or
the
possibility
of
that
point
was
never
raised
in
the
court
below.
mr.
david
boies
but
i
would
urge
the
court
to
consider
two
facts
in
this
particular
context,
your
honor.
first,
the
amount
of
the
difference
between
the
judgment
and
the
total
net
assets
is
such
that
it
is
at
a
minimum
very
unlikely
that
priority
would
become
a
factor.
and
second,
that
no
priority
as
a
practical
matter
was
going
to
be
achieved
through
the
bond
and
lien
provisions,
because,
unless
you
make
the
wholly
irrational
assumption
that
texaco
and
texaco's
other
creditors
would
simply
stand
by
while
these
liens
and
bonds--
mr.
david
boies
--this
goes
as
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
consideration
that
there
was
fair
ground
to
litigate
the
issue
of
the
due
process.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
it
is
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
there
is
at
least
fair
grounds
to
litigate
that,
where
you
have
a
bond
that
is
unnecessary
and
impossible
to
achieve,
for
all
the
reasons
both
the
district
court
and
the
court
of
appeals
indicate,
and
would
have
the
kind
of
effect
that
this
bond
would
have,
it
can
be
enjoined
on
an
as-applied
basis.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
the
argument
if
it
were
just
impossible,
justice
white,
would
not
be
nearly
as
strong
as
where
it
is
both
impossible
and
unnecessary.
mr.
david
boies
well,
the
impossibility--
mr.
david
boies
--i
think
the
impossibility
was
an
important
part
of
the
court
of
appeals'
decision.
at
page
1155
of
the
federal
reporter
opinion,
the
court
emphasizes
again
and
again
that
there
is
no
serious
dispute
that,
should
texaco
be
required
to
liquidate
its
assets,
the
judgment
will
be
collectible.
so
that
i
think
that
the
court
of
appeals
does
rest
its
conclusion
on
both
of
those
assets.
mr.
david
boies
justice
marshall,
i
think
that
that's
a
question
i
clearly
want
to
address.
mr.
david
boies
under
1983,
under
section
1983,
if
there
is
state
action
certainly
there
was
jurisdiction
for
the
court
to
entertain
this
claim.
we
believe
that
lugar,
rather
than
flagg
brothers,
is
the
right
analogy.
in
lugar,
just
as
here,
there
was
a
requirement
that
what
happened
was
that
the
attachment
be
taken
to
a
state
official,
that
that
state
official--
mr.
david
boies
--could
this
case
have
been
filed
in
anchorage?
mr.
david
boies
i
think--
mr.
david
boies
--i
don't
think
so,
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
boies
well,
one
of
the
differences
was,
your
honor,
of
course,
new
york
was
the
home
of--
mr.
david
boies
--we
don't,
your
honor.
new
york
was
the
place
where
the
bankruptcy
petition,
because
it's
the
principal
place
of
business
of
texaco,
was
going
to
be
filed.
one
of
two
things
was
going
to
happen:
either
these
bond
and
lien
provisions
were
going
to
be
enjoined
or
the
company
was
going
to
go
into
bankruptcy.
both
of
those
petitions
were
prepared
and
both
were
available
to
the
court.
if
we
had
not
gotten
the
relief
that
we
seek,
the
company
would
have
gone
into
chapter
11.
it
would
have
gone
in
in
the
federal
court
in
new
york.
and
that
was
a
very
important
reason
for
choosing
that
forum.
we
weren't
going
to
go
shopping--
mr.
david
boies
--what?
yes,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
is
in
the
record.
mr.
david
boies
no,
but
where
the
injury
occurred
typically
is,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
well,
new
york
was
the
situs
where
all
of
the
transactions
took
place,
and
indeed
the
texas
court
was
applying
new
york
law
to
this
case.
mr.
david
boies
and
the
injury
would
certainly
have
occurred
in
texas,
your
honor,
i
agree
with
that.
it
would
also
have
included
new
york
and
probably
some
other
states
where
texaco
has
its
substantial
assets.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
it
is
conceivable
under
the
venue
statutes
that
other
places
could
have
been
chosen.
i
don't
think
it's
anywhere
in
the
country.
but
as
a
practical
matter,
texaco
was
going
to
choose
the
place,
in
new
york,
that
made
logical
sense,
because
that
was
the
place
that,
in
the
absence
of
success
in
this
motion,
would
have
been
the
situs
of
the
bankruptcy
petition.
mr.
david
boies
i
do
not
believe
that
the
size
of
the
company
has
anything
to
do
with
it.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
that
where
you
have
the
combination
of
impossibility
and
lack
of
need,
that
is
true.
mr.
david
boies
assuming
that
he
makes
out
a
prima
facie
case.
mr.
david
boies
and
if
the
same
allegations
could
be
made--
mr.
david
boies
--entitled
to
go
into
court.
mr.
david
boies
it's
a
little
more
than
that,
your
honor,
because
although
the
size
of
the
company
doesn't
i
think
determine
the
rule
of
law,
the
size
and
the
amount
of
judgment
here
does
have
something
to
do
with
the
impossibility.
mr.
david
boies
there
are
two
elements
to
impossibility.
one
is
the
size
of
the
judgment
relative
to
the
size
of
the
company.
mr.
david
boies
the
other
is
the
size
of
the
judgment
relative
to
the
worldwide
bonding
capacity.
as
the
district
court
found--
mr.
david
boies
--right,
and
i
think
that
if
you
have
just
the
situation
where
you
have
a
bonding
company
that
doesn't
want
to
do
business
with
this
farm
or
small
business,
you
may
not
have
the
lack
of
need
that
you
do
in
a
case
such
as
this.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
that
there's
a
strong
argument
that
many
of
the
same
policies
that
underlie
the
court
of
appeals
decision
would
apply
there.
the
one
that
doesn't
is
the
absolute
impossibility,
which
comes
not
because
the
bonding
company
decides
it
doesn't
want
to
do
business,
but
because
of
the
unprecedented
size--
mr.
david
boies
--then
he's
got
to
prove
it,
yes.
and
then
it's
up
to
the
court
to
make,
obviously,
to
make
a
decision
whether
there's
any
substance
behind
the
mere
allegations.
i
do
want
to
deal
with
the...
go
back
to
the
1983
point
because
i
think
it
is
important
to
the
question
of
jurisdiction.
here
it
is
not
merely
a
question,
as
pennzoil
suggests,
that
they
wanted
to
record
their
judgment.
their
judgment
is
recorded.
what
they
now
want
to
do
with
that
judgment
is
take
a
copy
of
that
judgment
and,
just
as
was
done
in
lugar,
take
it
to
state
officials
who
then
will
use
it
either
to
execute
in
case
no
bond
is
posed
or
to
attach
liens
under
the
lien
statute.
and
this
is
exactly
what
happened
in
lugar.
now,
in
lugar,
lugar
was
a
pre-judgment--
mr.
david
boies
--but
when
they
try
to--
mr.
david
boies
--under
texas--
mr.
david
boies
--well,
under
texas
law
there
is
no
opportunity
to
litigate
it
unless
you
bring
in
state
court
what
we
did
in
federal
court,
an
independent
action
to
try
to
stop
them
from
doing
that.
mr.
david
boies
we
chose,
your
honor,
the
federal
forum.
mr.
david
boies
yes,
your
honor,
we
did.
and
we
seriously
considered
whether
the
case
be
brought
in
texas
or
in
new
york.
those
are
the
only
two
forums
that
we
considered.
we
didn't
consider
anchorage.
but
we
did,
though,
however,
decide
that
we
wanted
to
be
in
the
place
where
texaco
had
its
principal
place
of
business.
a
fundamental
part
of
that
decision
was
the
fact
that
that's
where
the
bankruptcy
petition
was
going
to
be
filed.
we
were
not
going
to
file
the
bankruptcy
petition
someplace
other
than
the
principal
place
of
business
of
texaco.
so
if
we
were
in
a
situation
where
we
were
going
to
federal
court,
we
decided
choosing
between,
as
the
venue
statutes
clearly
gave
us
the
right
to
do,
between
going
into
new
york
and
going
to
texas.
mr.
david
boies
no.
but
your
honor,
it
was
certainly
our
belief...
and
this
was
not
challenged
by
pennzoil
below...
that
we
had
the
right
under
the
venue
statute--
mr.
david
boies
--the
general
venue
statute,
to
choose
whether
we
came
into
new
york
or
texas.
that
obviously
didn't
give
us
necessarily
jurisdiction
without
proving
the
1983
claim.
mr.
david
boies
but
if
you
assume
that
we
had
a
1983
claim--
mr.
david
boies
--no,
your
honor,
i
don't
believe
we
can.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
we
get
under
it,
your
honor,
as
they
did
in
lugar,
by
demonstrating
that
what
you
have
is
state
action
in
terms
of
the
attachment
under
the
bond,
either
the
execution
under
the
bond
provision
or
the
attachment
under
the
lien.
mr.
david
boies
your
honor,
i
think
1983
was
passed
to
protect
important
civil
rights,
and
i
believe
that
those
important
civil
rights,
as
this
court
has
repeatedly
held,
include
rights
of
property
as
well
as
other
civil
rights.
mr.
david
boies
no,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
no,
your
honor,
we're
not
arguing
that
and
if
i
have
made
that
argument
i
apologize.
the
argument
that
i
am
making
is
an
argument
that
i
think
ought
to
apply
to
all
companies
that
come
into
court
and
all
individuals
that
come
into
court
with
a
valid
1983
action.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
there
are
two
aspects
of
it.
one
is
the
1983
bar
and
one
is
the
substantive
bar,
that
is
whether
you
can
make
out
a
due
process
claim.
with
respect
to
the
1983
bar,
i
think
you
have
to
show
that
what
you're
attacking
is
not
the
merits
of
the
judgment.
that
is,
you're
not
in
court
just
because
you
lost.
mr.
david
boies
because
i
think
that
if
what
you
are
attacking,
if
what
you're
trying
to
do
is
attack
the
underlying
merits
of
the
judgment
and
in
effect
do
what
pennzoil
counsel
says
we're
trying
to
do,
which
is
sidetrack
and
stop
the
state
proceeding,
your
honor--
mr.
david
boies
--yes,
although
even
our
original
complaint,
your
honor,
only
asked
for
an
injunction
on
the
timing
of
enforcement.
we
never
asked
the
district
court
to
do
anything
to
interfere
with
the
normal
appellate
processes.
those
appellate
processes
are
going
forward.
we've
argued
the
case
in
the
court
of
appeals
down
in
texas.
there's
been
no
attempt
at
any
point
ever
to
suggest
that
we
wanted
any
court
other
than
the
normal
appellate
route
in
texas
and
ultimately
to
this
court,
if
necessary,
to
decide
the
merits
of
the
case.
there
is
no
attempt
to
take
those
merits
issues
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
tort
and
how
much
damage
ought
to
be--
mr.
david
boies
--the
second
safeguard
is
the
fact
that
we
think
it
is
going
to
be
an
unusual
case
where
you
are
going
to
have
a
clear
case
that
the
bond
is
not
necessary
and
a
clear
case
where
the
bond
would
be
truly
impossible
to
post
and,
third,
a
case
where
execution
or
putting
on
liens
would
have
such
great
difficulty
and
cause
such
irreparable
injury.
mr.
david
boies
it
would,
your
honor,
in
relationship,
certainly,
the
size
of
the
pocket
to
the
size
of
the
judgment.
and
i
do
take--
mr.
david
boies
--it
does
not.
i
think
that
to
the
extent
that's
relevant
at
all,
it
only
gets
relevant
when
you
begin
to
talk
about
lack
of
need.
mr.
david
boies
precisely,
precisely
right,
your
honor.
and
i
think
that
that...
if
you
had
a
shallow
pocket,
if
you
had
a
situation
where
pennzoil
really
needed
this
security,
contrary
to
what
they
have
said,
contrary
to
what
the
court
of
appeals
said,
you
would
have
a
different
and
much
more
difficult
situation.
mr.
david
boies
that
sometimes
happens.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
that's
right,
your
honor.
i
think
that
there
are
occasions,
many
occasions,
where
companies
will,
under
at
least
the
current
law,
be
forced
to
that
choice.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
it
does--
mr.
david
boies
--i
think
it
does
raise
issues,
your
honor.
it
is,
i
think,
a
more
difficult
case
than
the
case
we're
confronted
with,
where
you
have
both
impossibility
and
lack
of
need.
i
think
it
does
raise
problems,
but
i
think
those
problems
are
not
nearly
as
severe
as
the
problems
we
have
in
this
particular
case.
i
want
to
try
to
address
the
question
of
remedies,
because
there's
some
implication
texaco
just
jumped
into
federal
court,
apparently
without
any
reason
other
than
preferring
the
federal
court
to
a
state
court.
as
the
supplemental
findings
of
the
court,
the
district
court
below,
findings
82
through
91,
demonstrate,
there
was
an
attempt
to
get
a
hearing
down
in
texas
with
the
court
before
whom
the
matter
was
pending
to
see
whether
there
was
any
possibility
of
resolving
this
under
texas
procedure.
on
december
13,
texas
counsel
for
texaco
wrote
the
court
outlining
the
problems
and
asking
for
a
hearing.
this
was
after
the
judgment
had
been
entered.
pennzoil
opposed
such
a
hearing.
pennzoil
now
says
there
were
lots
of
remedies.
mr.
david
boies
we
did
not
expressly
assert
the
constitutional--
mr.
david
boies
--well,
we
raised
the
question
that
we
were
going
to,
unless
some
relief
was
granted,
be
driven
into
bankruptcy,
and
that
the
security
was
not
needed.
we
did
not
identify
the
constitutional
issues,
your
honor.
we
were
trying
at
the
outset
to
just
get
a
hearing
at
which
we
could
raise
the
issues.
pennzoil,
who
has
taken
the
position
before
this
court
that
there
were
any
remedies
for
us
down
in
texas,
took
the
position
down
in
texas
at
that
time...
and
this
again
is
reflected
in
the
court's
findings...
that
the
only
thing
the
court
had
the
jurisdiction
to
do
then
was
deal
with
a
new
trial
motion
under
349(b)
of
the
texas
rules
of
civil
procedure.
mr.
david
boies
your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
it
would
be
a
younger
case
because,
as
this
court
in
middlesex
points
out,
there
are
three
steps
that
you
have
to
go
through
to
determine
whether
or
not
younger
is
applicable.
first
you
have
to
determine
that
there
is
a
proceeding.
mr.
david
boies
well,
i
think
that
footnote
9
in
the
trainor
case
suggests
that
this
is
not
a
proceeding.
mr.
david
boies
right.
second,
there
has
to
be
a
vital
or
important
state
interest.
mr.
david
boies
and
we
really
say
that
there
is
no
vital
or
important
state
interest.
mr.
tribe
says
that--
mr.
david
boies
--there
is
state
action
to
trigger
1983,
but
the
state
interest--
mr.
david
boies
--has
to
be
in
the
proceeding.
mr.
david
boies
mr.
tribe
properly
identifies
what
that
proceeding
is.
he
says
it's
the
underlying
proceeding,
the
proceeding
that's
going
on
down
in
texas
courts.
mr.
david
boies
yes.
but
that
interest
would
exist
in
every
case.
that
would
mean
that
every
case
under
1983,
contrary
to
certainly
the
implication
of
mitchum
v.
foster--
mr.
david
boies
--would
be
a
younger
abstention
case.
mr.
david
boies
no,
justice
marshall.
mr.
david
boies
the
state
action
would
be
the
action
of
the
sheriffs
and
the
abstract
personnel.
mr.
david
boies
no,
they're
not,
your
honor.
what
we
have
done
is
we
have
sued,
as
was
done
in
lugar,
we
have
sued
the
private
individuals
who,
as
they
did
under
lugar,
have
the
power--
mr.
david
boies
--well,
i
wouldn't
say
that
we
were
lost.
i
would
say
that
if
lugar
had...
if
lugar
were
reversed,
our
argument
would
be
very
much
more
difficult.
mr.
david
boies
i
don't
think
we
would
be
lost,
your
honor.
mr.
david
boies
it
would
depend
on
how
it
was
distinguished.
mr.
david
boies
i
think
what
we
would
have
if
lugar
were
distinguished
is
that
we
would
have
the
fact
of
the
state
action.
that
would
exist
whether
or
not--
mr.
david
boies
--i
would
say
state
action
would
include
something
even
if
it
were
not
directly
appealable.
mr.
david
boies
i
think,
with
respect,
justice
marshall,
that's
not
right.
the
lecroy
case
which
pennzoil
counsel
relies
on,
where
relief
came
not
a
week
after
the
complaint
was
filed,
but
two
months
after
the
complaint
was
filed.
it
came
a
week
after
the
hearing,
but
it
took
two
months
to
get
the
hearing.
in
the
lecroy
case,
that
was
not
an
appeal.
that
was
a
case
where
they
brought
an
original
action.
the
texas
attorney
general
who
appeared
before
the
second
circuit
has
not
appeared
here,
but
did
appear
before
the
second
circuit,
said
that
the
only
remedy
was
to
bring
an
original
action
either
in
the
appellate
court
or
the
supreme
court.
he
conceded
at
pages
9
and
10
of
his
reply
brief
before
the
court
of
appeals
that
bringing
it
in
the
appellate
court
would
have
waived
some
important
appeal
rights
of
texaco.
so
the
practical
remedy
that
the
attorney
general
of
texas
said
we
had,
and
the
only
one,
was
to
bring
an
original
action
in
the
state
of
texas
supreme
court.
mr.
david
boies
excuse
me?
mr.
david
boies
the
judgment
on
the
merits
ultimately
will
be
appealable
here,
your
honor.
the
state
action
on
the
bond
and
lien
provisions...
if
we
had
brought
an
original
action,
i
think
we
could
have
brought
an
original
action
in
the
state
of
texas,
as
opposed
to
bringing
it
in
the
federal
courts
in
new
york.
but
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
that
this
court's
decisions
have
held
is
that
when
you
are
talking
about
bringing
an
original
action,
if
you've
got
1983
jurisdiction
there's
no...
and
you're
not
talking
about
enjoining
a
criminal
proceeding
or
other
proceeding
where
there's
an
important
state
interest...
you
do
have
the
ability
and
the
choice
to
choose
a
federal
forum
to
vindicate
that
federal
right.
and
while
i'm
not
at
all
suggesting
that
the
federal
rights
of
large
corporations
are
more
important
than
the
federal
rights
of
individuals
or
the
federal
rights
of
small
corporations,
i
think
when
we
begin
to
divide
federal
rights
and
when
we
begin
to
treat
the
enforcement
of
the
federal
rights
of
citizenship
that
all
people
and
all
companies
ought
to
enjoy
under
the
constitution,
i
think
we
endanger
those
rights
for
everybody,
because
i
think
that
the
principle
that
where
you
have
a
federal
right
you
have,
absent
some
special
circumstances,
the
right
to
have
that
cause
of
action
adjudicated
in
a
federal
forum
is
something
that
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
to
be
of
critical
significance.
and
here
we
believe
that
under
younger,
which
would
be
the
appropriate
issue
if
you
had
a
1983
action,
you
do
not
have
that
important
vital
state
interest.
and
even
if
you
did,
we
believe
you'd
come
under
one
of
the
exceptions
to
younger
in
the
sense
that
you
do
not
have
an
adequate
remedy
or,
as
the
court
in
gibson
against
berryhill
indicated,
an
adequate
opportunity
to
raise
and
have
timely
decided,
411
u.s.
577,
your
constitutional
claims.
it's
not
merely
the
opportunity
to
raise;
it
is
the
opportunity
to
have
timely
decided.
and
the
importance
of
that
timeliness
aspect
was
reinforced
in
the
middlesex
case
mr.
tribe
refers
to,
where
they
did
say,
where
the
court
did
say,
you've
got
to
have
a
plainly
inadequate
remedy.
but
they
then
went
on
to
quote
the
gibson
against
berryhill
language
to
show
that
if
your
remedy
is
untimely
it
is
inadequate.
mr.
david
boies
thank
you.
