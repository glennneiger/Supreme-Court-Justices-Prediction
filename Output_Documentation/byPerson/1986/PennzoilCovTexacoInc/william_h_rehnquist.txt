h.
rehnquist
it
makes
some
difference
in
answering
justice
o'connor's
question
rally
on
whom
the
burden
is
to
show
that
there
was
or
was
not
a
state
remedy.
i
mean,
i
think
that
that
might
be
controlling
here
on
this
issue.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
mr.
boies,
we'll
hear
from
you.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
other
people,
after
pennzoil
got
its
judgment,
got
similar
judgments
against
texaco?
there
would
have
come
a
point
when
texaco
couldn't
have
satisfied
all
those
judgments,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
it
may
not
have
been
raised,
but
that's
what
most
priority
statutes
are
for.
you
don't
have
to
show
that
there's
a
present
inability
to
meet
the
demand.
you
get
a
priority
because
later
judgments
may
come
along
that
would
force
bankruptcy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
this
is
an
argument
directed
to
the
merits,
i
take
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
the
view
of
the
court
of
appeals
then
that
a
bond
statute
that
may
be
perfectly
fair
in
99
percent
of
the
cases
can
be
enjoined
in
the
rare
case
where
it
feels
it's
unfair?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
factors
like
that
mentioned
in
the
venue
statute?
i
mean,
ordinarily
the
reasons
the
plaintiff
has,
it
isn't
a
very
discretionary
thing
as
to
whether
you
can
or
cannot
lay
venue
in
a
particular
place.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
say
the
injury
occurred
in
new
york,
rather
than
texas?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
the
injury
your
client
suffered
was
the
refusal
of
a
texas
court
to
relieve
the
bond
requirement
under
texas
law,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
so
you
say
you
could
file
this
action
wherever
you
could
find
pennzoil
doing
business?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
general
venue
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
to
a
certain
extent,
the
shallower
the
pocket
the
more
need
for
a
bond.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
boies.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
tribe,
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
really
the
rooker-feldman
line
of
cases,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
i
wonder
if
your
point
under
the
rooker-feldman
act
isn't
perhaps
stronger
than
your
1983
state
action.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tribe.
the
case
is
submitted.
