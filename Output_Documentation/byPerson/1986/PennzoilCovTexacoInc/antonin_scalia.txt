mr.
tribe,
let
me
ask
you
where
this
goes.
if
we
go
along
with
you
and
assume
that
the
private
party
who's
reducing
the
judgment
to
effect
a
collection
is
not
a
state
actor,
what
about
these
functionaries
who
are
assisting
him?
are
they
state
actors?
is
the
problem
here
simply
that
the
wrong
party
was
sued
and
that
you
could
have
sued
someone
else
in
federal
court
in
massachusetts
and
achieved
this
result?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i'm
sorry.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
you're
not
saying...
your
basic
argument
is
not
that
this
is
not
a
state
actor,
but
that
there
is
no
state
action
here?
