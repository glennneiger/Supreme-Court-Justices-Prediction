justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
let
me
just
interrupt
you
right
there.
i'm
interested
in
whether
there
is
a
limiting
principle
to
your
argument
with
respect
to
the
applicabilty
of
section
1983.
may
every
defeated
litigant
who,
for
whatever
reason,
can't
get
bond
automatically
become
entitled
to
go
into
federal
court
under
1983?
if
not,
why
not?

why
not?
justice

--wouldn't
the
ability
to
post
the
bond
depend
to
some
extent
on
whether
or
not
the
party
had
a
deep
pocket?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
does
1983
jurisdiction
depend
on
the
size
of
the
pocket?
