justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
tribe,
are
you
really
arguing
for
a
younger
abstention?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
i
understand
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
what
is
the
state
interest
that's
meant
to
be
protected?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
his
premise
is
it
really
is
a
major
piece
of
state
action.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
in
enforcing
its
judgments.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
they've
got
these
remedies,
but
suppose
they
had
resorted
to
them
and
they
had
been
denied.
justice
byron
r.
white
they're
supposed
to
come
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
wouldn't
justify
the
federal
court
doing
anything.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
isn't
a
question
of
exhaustion;
it's
a
question
of
availability.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
tribe,
i
take
it
your
last
argument
is
that
there
is
just
no
denial
of
due
process
anyway?
justice
byron
r.
white
is
this
a
preliminary
injunction?
justice
byron
r.
white
does
this
argument
go
to
the
fact
that
there
would
have
been
or
was
a
due
process
violation
by
requiring
this
bond?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
why
you
put
the
"unnecessary"
in
there.
you'd
make
the
same
argument
if
it
was
just
impossible.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you'd
still
be
making
it.
and
i
would
suppose
the
court
of
appeals
really
went
on
the
impossibility
side
of
it,
didn't
it,
that
texaco
just
couldn't
satisfy
this
bond?
justice
byron
r.
white
without
going...
and
that
it
would
precipitate
bankruptcy.
justice
byron
r.
white
at
least
the
district
court
judge
must
have
agreed
with
something.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
is
your
second
safeguard,
in
answer
to
justice--
justice
byron
r.
white
you'd
put
them
right
into
bankruptcy
in
the
effort
of
collecting
your
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
without
any
1983
problem
at
all?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it
certainly
in
your
mind
doesn't
raise
any
due
process
problem
if
the
size
of
the
bond
that
the
state
law
requires
is
impossible
to
meet
by
the
defendant?
justice
byron
r.
white
unless
you
have
this
other
aspect
to
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
submit
in
that
letter
or
in
any
filing
down
there
any
constitutional
issues?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
or
impliedly?
justice
byron
r.
white
can
i
ask
you,
mr.
boies,
suppose
there
just
weren't
any
remedies
there.
do
you
think
that
this
would
be
a
younger
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
there
was.
there
was,
wasn't
there?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
assume
there
is
a
proceeding
going
on
down
there.
if
there
isn't
you
don't
have
too
much
to
worry
about.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that's
what
you
really--
justice
byron
r.
white
--although
enough
to
trigger
1983.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
interest
is
to
enforce
the
judgment,
he
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
would
be
a
younger
abstention
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
mr.
boies,
i
take
it
that
if
you
win
in
this
case
you
won't
be
back
in
court
on
1988?
[laughter]
justice
byron
r.
white
it
would
be
a
younger
case
any
time
you
went
into
federal
court
to
try
to
block
the
enforcement
of
a
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
right
across
the
board.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
if
you
accept
that.
but
you
have
to
accept
that
before
you
get
to
younger.
