mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
now,
that
concept
must
stop
short
of
private
litigants
who
merely
ask
the
state
courts
for
relief
win
at
trial
and
then
ask
that
the
judgments
in
their
favor
be
duly
recorded,
because
if
the
state
action
concept
reached
that
far
then
every
state
court
proceeding
would
automatically
become
a
target
for
a
federal
injunction
and
the
1983
exception
would
then
utterly
swallow
the
anti-injunction
rule.
and
indeed,
quite
apart
from
the
impact
on
the
anti-injunction
act,
if
the
state
action
concept
engulfed
all
who
invoked
judicial
process
and,
with
the
help
of
court
functionaries,
record
the
judgments
that
they
win,
the
distinction
between
private
and
public
action
so
fundamental
to
this
court's
jurisprudence
would
be
obliterated.
now,
texaco
i
think
sees
the
threat
here,
but
it
says
there's
no
problem
because
pennzoil
is
not
like
an
ordinary
private
plaintiff.
why
not?
well,
the
reason,
you
see,
is
that
the
state
of
texas
abdicated
to
pennzoil
what
they
call
a
judicially
unsupervised
power
to
control
disputed
property
and
to
decide
whether
texaco
will
have
to
post
full
security
to
stay
the
judgment.
that
theory
about
texas
law
is
a
complete
fantasy.
it
was
not
even
adopted
by
the
second
circuit,
which
was
content
to
observe
that
in
order
to
enforce
its
judgment
pennzoil
would,
as
a
judgment
winner
must
in
every
state,
act
together
with
various
functionaries
in
getting
the
judgment
recorded
and
in
the
process
of
execution.
i
want
to
examine--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
i
think
they
would
have
preferred
new
york.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
whoever
they
sued,
i
think
there
is
a
more
fundamental
problem.
it's
not
just
who
you
denominate
as
the
actor,
it's
the
concept
of
state
action.
the
mere
identification
of
functionaries
would
not
solve
the
problem,
because
one
could
then
always
sidetrack
a
state
proceeding
by
identifying
the
clerk
with
whom
a
complaint
was
filed
or
some
other
functionary.
the
real
question
is
whether
there
is
any
problematic
state
action
that
can
be
adjudicated
in
this
particular
lawsuit.
of
course,
they
didn't
sue--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
in
the
background
of
the
case,
in
enacting
its
laws
texas
acted.
but
that
was
true
also
in
flagg
brothers,
and
it's
always
true.
we're
saying
that
no
state
action
is
properly
challenged
in
this
lawsuit,
not
that
the
state
of
texas
has
never
acted.
indeed,
the
government
of
texas
acted
in
a
four
and
a
half
month
trial
to
adjudicate
the
liability
between
these
parties,
and
in
doing
so
it
rendered
a
judgment
that
is
final
and
claim
preclusive
under
texas
law.
it
is
that
fact,
the
adjudication
of
that
judgment,
which
is
simply
recorded
in
the
form
of
a
lien
if
the
lien
statute
comes
into
operation
in
this
case.
they
try
to
present
the
picture
that
somehow
pennzoil
is
the
repository
of
an
abdication
of
state
responsibility,
that
the
courts
of
texas
are
somehow
not
supervising
the
power
pennzoil
is
wielding,
and
that
it
is
for
this
reason
that
the
1983
exception
suddenly
opens
the
door
to
a
federal
flanking
maneuver
that
otherwise
would
be
unavailable.
indeed,
justice
scalia--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--justice
o'connor--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--it's
a
distant
relative
of
lugar,
i
think,
justice
o'connor,
because
in
justice
white's
majority
opinion
in
lugar
care
was
taken--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--in
the
opinion
for
the
court
in
lugar,
great
care
was
taken--
[laughter]
great
care
was
taken
to
distinguish
the
case
of
an
ex
parte
pre-judgment
attachment
where
the
state
was
abdicating
power
to
a
private
party.
there
is
all
the
difference
in
the
world
between
allowing
private
parties
to
go
around
deciding,
let's
see,
we'll
seize
this
oil
company
or
we'll
take
that
asset,
and
simply
enforcing
a
judgment.
and
with
respect
to
the
lien
statute,
all
that's
being
done,
it's
like
recording
a
mortgage,
or
in
an
example
justice
stevens
once
gave,
recording
a
car
transaction.
it's
simply
recording
your
place
in
line.
now,
there
is
of
course
also
the
bond
provision
but
the
bond
provision
does
not
delegate
power
to
pennzoil.
if
anything,
it
delegates
some
power
to
texaco.
that
is,
if
they
can
post
a
full
bond
then
automatically
they're
entitled
to
stay
the
judgment.
it
also
leaves
power
in
the
hands
of
the
courts
of
texas,
quite
obviously.
the
trial
court
in
this
very
case
entered
a
stay
unsecured
preventing
any
enforcement
action
for
a
full
three
and
a
half
months,
as
paragraph
7
of
the
judgment.
and
if
texaco
had
bothered
to
ask
for
an
extended
standstill,
if
they
wanted
to
have
an
unsecured
judgment
for
a
longer
time,
it
would
be
not
texaco,
but
the
courts
of
texas,
that
would
decide
whether
they
were
entitled
under
texas
law
and
under
federal
law
to
that
relief.
it
seems
to
us
that,
despite
the
attempt
to
make
this
look
like
an
abdication
of
state
power,
what
we
really
have
is
a
distant
relative
of
lugar,
but
a
distant
relative
separated
by
a
vast
chasm,
because
unlike
lugar,
in
this
case
all
we
have
is
a
winning
plaintiff.
and
a
1983
that
becomes
an
excuse
whenever
you
have
a
constitutional
complaint
that
you
can
make,
that
becomes
an
excuse
for
sideswiping
state
proceedings
and
engaging
in
federal
flanking
maneuvers,
isn't
just
an
express
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act;
it
ends
the
meaningful
operation
of
that
act.
and
one
of
the
answers
texaco
gives
i
just
want
to
spend
a
moment
with,
and
that
is
they
suggest,
in
line
i
think
with
your
question,
justice
scalia:
oh,
come
on;
there's
really
no
impact
on
the
act;
if
you
want
to
have
us
do
it
over
again,
we'll
sue
some
state
functionaries.
but
of
course,
they
concede
in
their
brief
in
this
court
that
a
suit
against
state
functionaries
where
discretion
is
exercised,
as
it
would
be
here,
would
be
premature
in
a
case
like
this.
they're
simply
speculating
that
the
functionaries
of
texas
will
effectively
destroy
them
without
giving
them
a
meaningful
opportunity.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
would
think
then,
justice
stevens,
the
proper
way
to
challenge
what
the
state
had
done
would
be
to
ask
the
state,
as
texaco
has
never
done,
to
obliterate
that
distinction,
to
make
a
proper
motion,
and
on
denial
in
review
in
this
court
there
would
be
state
action,
just
like
shelly
v.
kramer.
that
is,
when
the
state
courts--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--no,
if
you
merely
sued
the
private
party,
and
you
couldn't
sue
the
legislature--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
regardless
of
whom
you
sue,
you
would
not
be
suing
the
responsible
state
actors,
in
that
case
those
who
crafted
an
impermissible
rule
of
law.
there
was
in
flagg
brothers
state
action
lurking
in
the
background,
but
there
was
not
state
action
that
was
properly
brought
before
a
federal
court.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
i
think
they
could
go
shopping
anywhere
where
they
could
find
a
federal
judge
and
bring
a
flanking
maneuver
anywhere.
forum
shopping
is
open
season.
now,
it
seems
to
us
that
in
a
sense
that
ends
the
case.
that
is,
if
there
is
no
1983
exception
the
anti-injunction
act
is
not
a
vague,
fuzzy
doctrine;
it's
a
flat
bar.
but
just
in
case
the
court
is
not
persuaded,
i
do
think
it's
important
to
recognize
that
there
is
far
more
wrong
with
what
the
courts
below
did
than
that.
that
is,
even
if
section
1983
were
available
on
some
theory,
the
second
circuit
nonetheless
impermissibly
separated
the
sword
of
section
1983
from
the
abstention
shield
that
this
court
in
mitchum
v.
foster
carefully
assured
would
serve
as
a
backstop
to
protect
state
proceedings
precisely
when
the
1983
sword
was
available
to
create
an
exception
to
1983.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
an
exception
to
the
anti-injunction
act,
sorry,
to
2283,
the
anti-injunction
act.
the
entire
architecture
of
the
mitchum
doctrine
was
designed
to
assure
that
there
would
be
no
gap
within
which
state
proceedings
would
be
left
utterly
unprotected,
either
by
the
absolute
barrier
of
the
anti-injunction
act
or
by
the
rather
more
porous
shield
of
the
abstention
doctrine.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
justice
o'connor,
the
trial
and
the
appeal
were
the
proceeding
in
which
the
complaints
that
they
had
ought
to
have
been
raised.
the
injunction
was
against
invoking
any
state
procedure
for
enforcing
this
judgment
or
for
dealing
with
the
problem
of
security.
but
just
as
this
court
in
trainor
v.
hernandez,
where
there
was
a
clear
bifurcation
between
the
attachment
procedures
of
the
state
and
the
substantive
action
against
the
alleged
welfare
cheaters,
just
as
in
that
case
the
court
said
that
it
would
not
allow
a
kind
of
baloney-slicing
approach
to
be
taken
by
litigants
who
want
to
engage
in
flanking
maneuvers,
so
here
the
fact
that
they
choose
to
focus
on
whatever
procedures
might
surround
the
issue
of
the
bond
and
the
security
should
not
take
this
court's
attention
from
the
fact
that
texaco
was
not
a
litigant
in
aimless
search
of
a
court
in
which
to
appear.
they
were
before
a
trial
court
of
plenary
jurisdiction,
the
very
court
that
gave
them
a
three
and
a
half
month
fully
unsecured
stay,
during
which
it
is
clear
that
any
respect
for
the
courts
of
texas
would
have
led
them,
not
to
a
federal
court
in
white
plains
or
anchorage
or
hawaii,
but
right
back
into
the
court
where
they
were
litigating.
and
as
we
point
out
in
our
reply
brief,
there
were
at
least
five
avenues
of
procedural
relief
manifestly
available
to
them.
the
plenary
power
of
the
trial
court
to
supervise
its
own
judgments
plainly
here...
as
the
district
court
itself
expressly
found,
the
trial
court
had
the
power
and
the
duty
to
entertain
their
request
to
reduce
the
bond
on
federal
constitutional
grounds.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
think
not,
justice
o'connor.
the
reason
is
that,
as
this
court
recognized
in
moore
versus
sims,
one
of
the
purposes
of
younger
abstention
is
to
allow
questions
of
state
law
that
may
be
ambiguous
to
be
resolved
in
the
state
courts
where
the
case
is
already
pending.
if
this
case
had
not
originated
in
the
courts
of
texas,
if
they
were
not
before
a
trial
judge
with
plenary
jurisdiction,
if
it
had
originated
in
the
federal
courts
and
then
they
brought
a
complaint
raising
doubtful
questions
about
state
law,
then
a
pullman
type
abstention
might
make
sense.
but
nothing
could
make
less
sense
than
to
bounce
back
and
forth
from
the
courts
of
texas
to
the
federal
courts,
back
to
texas
again,
while
the
question
they
could
easily
have
resolved
by
asking
the
court
for
relief
could
have
been
resolved
there.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
chief
justice
rehnquist,
as
this
court
repeatedly
has
said,
unless
it
plainly
appears
that
there
was
no
remedy,
one
can't
simply
indulge
a
negative
and
hostile
presumption.
and
in
that
sense,
what
the
court
said
in
middlesex
and
juidice
suggests
that
the
burden
would
be
controlling.
but
we
don't
think
there's
even
any
genuine
doubt
here.
that
is,
there
are
numerous
cases...
we've
cited
them
in
the
reply
brief
and
elsewhere...
in
which
the
texas
courts
in
the
exercise
of
their
plenary
jurisdiction
have
suspended
judgments,
even
money
judgments,
without
bonds;
the
fairbanks
case,
for
example,
and
there
others.
we
think
they
are
conjuring
doubts
where
doubts
don't
exist.
there
are
in
addition
the
stay
of
judgment
statute
clearly
available
in
the
trial
court,
65.013.
there
is
mandamus
from
the
court
to
the
clerk
to
reduce
the
bond.
in
the
lecroy
case,
which
we
have
discussed
throughout
this
proceeding,
in
the
lecroy
case,
which
texaco
does
not
respond
to,
there
was
a
clearcut
state
rule
in
texas
that
said
you
couldn't
file
a
complaint
unless
you
paid
an
additional
$75.
no
ambiguity
about
it
at
all.
but
texas
has
an
unusually
generous
open
court
procedure.
a
writ
of
mandamus
was
sought
from
the
trial
court
to
the
clerk.
mandamus
was
issued
within
a
week.
the
supreme
court
of
texas
affirmed.
that
is,
the
state
law
here
is
not
really
unclear.
all
the
way
from
1890
in
the
dillingham
case
to
1986
in
the
lecroy
case,
the
courts
of
texas
have
been
extraordinarily
generous
in
eliminating
alleged
obstacles
to
meaningful
access
to
the
judicial
process.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
absolutely.
we
initially
say
the
anti-injunction
act
is
a
bar.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
falling
back
from
that,
we
say
that
younger
abstention
was
required
under
trainor.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
the
interest,
as
in
juidice,
in
ensuring
the
enforceability
of
state
judgments.
it
seems
to
us
very
bizarre
to
say
that
there
is
a
state
interest
in
conducting
trials,
but
no
interest
in
seeing
to
it
that
the
results
of
those
trials
are
worth
more
than
the
paper
they
are
written
on.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
the
state
acts
in
conducting
the
trial,
that
we
don't
deny,
as
i
suggested
to
justice
stevens.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
and
in
making
sure
its
judgments
are
enforced.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
we
say
that
1983
does
not
apply,
and
therefore
you
don't
even
need
to
reach
younger.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
we
don't
believe
that
the
federal
district
court
in
white
plains
had
any
jurisdiction
in
the
premises
whatever.
and
we
believe
that
among
the
reasons
was
that,
apart
from
the
remedies
available
in
the
trial
courts,
there
are
two
important
remedies
that
continue
to
be
available
in
the
appellate
courts
of
texas,
which
they
have
made
no
effort
whatever
to
exhaust.
there
is
the
request
under
365(b)
to
reduce
a
bond
if
it's
deemed
excessive
and,
most
important,
there
are
the
parallel
to
the
all
writs
statutes
in
texas,
giving
an
appellate
court
the
power
that
was
exercised
in
pace
v.
mcewen.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
then
they'd
have
come
straight
here.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
exactly.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
exactly.
it
was
the
wrong
federal
court.
that
is,
there
is
a
federal
court
with
appellate
concern
and
appellate
jurisdiction
to
protect,
and
i'm
looking
at
it.
this
is
the
relevant
federal
court.
in
nebraska
press
and
in--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
i
think
it's
a
multi-faceted
prism,
justice
white.
and
we
think
that
we
win
regardless
of
which
facet
one
looks
through.
in
fact,
let
me
focus
on
the
question
of
the
right
or
the
wrong
court
in
just
a
moment,
after
i
come
back
to
chief
justice
rehnquist's
question
of
the
burden.
you
see,
i
do
think
they're
arguing
that
the
usual
burdens
should
be
reversed
here,
because
even
though
the
texas
parents
involved
in
moore
versus
sims
were
not
allowed
to
speculate
that
texas
remedies
might
not
be
adequate...
this
court
said
such
hostile
speculations
and
predictions
of
futility
will
not
do...
and
even
though
the
virginia
prisoner
in
smith
v.
murray
was
not
allowed
to
speculate,
and
even
though
the
ohio
school
teachers
in
the
dayton
christian
schools
case
were
told
that
forecasts
of
frustration
will
not
do,
they
have
an
argument
which
in
essence
says
that:
for
us
uncertainty
was
terrifying,
because
we
had
no
way
of
knowing
what
would
happen
in
the
texas
courts;
there's
this
three
and
a
half
month
grace
period,
but
for
all
we
know
those
texas
judges
will
interpret
it
in
a
nasty
way,
or
for
all
we
know,
even
though
in
its
own
terms
that
grace
period
can
only
expire
after
a
complete
adversary
hearing,
it
will
be
unreasonably
cut
short.
therefore,
our
bankers
and
our
financiers
are
nervous.
therefore
we
need
instant
relief,
and
nothing
less
will
do.
it's
a
kind
of
fortune
500
exception
for
federalism.
everybody
else
has
to
take
the
rule
as
they
find
it,
but
we
are
now
told
that
if
you
are
rich
enough
and
big
enough
to
project
your
fears
onto
the
stock
exchange
display
board
then
you've
got
a
better
deal.
i
do
want
to
reserve
time
for
rebuttal,
but
i
want
to
suggest
how
important
it
is
that
this
is
the
right
court.
this
court
would
have
required
exhaustion,
as
it
did
even
in
volkswagenwerk
in
michigan.
they
had
requested
relief
from
the
michigan
supreme
court,
even
though
that
court
had
not
acted.
but
what
the
district
court
in
this
case
did
was
create
an
analogy
to
monroe
and
patsy.
it
said
that
because
the
section
1983
plaintiff
has
a
choice
of
forum
and
may
as
an
original
matter
choose
to
go
to
federal
court,
we'll
simply
extend
it
a
little
to
the
defendant
in
a
pending
state
proceeding.
that
makes
all
the
difference
in
the
world,
because
what
they
got
was
a
stay
in
aid
of
appellate
jurisdiction,
and
the
one
court
that
could
have
been
asked
for
it,
this
court,
if
the
courts
below
had
denied
relief,
instead
gets
the
case
through
the
back
door,
through
an
avenue
of
relief
that
completely
disorients
the
structure
of
federalism
in
place
since
the
anti-injunction
act
of
1793.
thank
you.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
that's
correct.
if
you
were
to
reach
the
merits,
we
think
that
it's
clear
that
security
was
needed,
as
the
district
court
found,
although
i
should
say
that
if
this
case
goes
back
to
the
texas
courts
that
in
those
courts
i
can
formally
represent
on
behalf
of
pennzoil
that
what
we
want
is
a
flexible
security
arrangement.
if
the
injunction
is
reversed,
we
are
going
to
take
no
action
whatever
to
enforce
it,
as
long
as
they
promptly
ask
the
texas
courts
for
some
suitable
form
of
relief.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
it
is
preliminary
in
name,
but
final
in
effect,
since
no
further
proceedings
need
to
be
conducted.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
on
the
merits
it
is
there,
on
the
merits
it
is
there.
they've
sideswiped
the
jurisdictional
issue.
thank
you.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
that
this
case
as
it
has
now
emerged
is
all
about
the
question
of
limiting
principles
and
whether
there
are
any,
whether
instead
we're
being
asked
for
a
railroad
ticket
good
for
one
company
only,
which
will
then
come
back
to
haunt
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court
and
the
faith
of
this
country
in
the
rule
of
law.
i
think
justice
powell's
question
was
critical
about
the
question
of
limiting
principles
for
this
extraordinary
theory
about
state
action
that
has
been
advanced
in
this
court.
the
theory
basically
is
you
invoke
the
courts
of
the
state,
and
if
you
ever
dare
to
do
anything
as
radical
as
trying
to
enforce
the
judgment
there
is
enough
state
action
to
provide
a
1983
lawsuit
anywhere
where
venue
can
be
found.
the
limiting
principle
suggested
is
primarily
a
theory
about
the
substantive
argument
here,
about
due
process.
that
was
mr.
boies'
answer
to
justice
powell.
it
was
we'll
rarely
have
as
strong
a
due
process
argument
as
we
have
here.
arguments
on
the
merits
are
hardly
limiting
principles
for
threshold
doctrines
like
state
action.
it
would
be
like
saying
the
anti-injunction
act
means
that
you
can
never
get
an
injunction
to
stay
proceedings
in
any
state
court,
unless
of
course
you
happen
to
have
a
valid
claim
on
the
merits.
essentially,
that
removes
the
shield
of
the
anti-injunction
act
absolutely.
that
can't
be
a
limiting
principle,
and
we
have
yet
to
hear
one.
it
seems
to
me
that
if
one
accepts
their
point
of
view,
it
means
that
there
is
a
1983
action
whenever
you
have
any
constitutional
argument
you'd
like
to
make
arising
out
of
a
state
proceeding;
you
don't
really
have
to
make
it
in
the
ordinary
course
and
on
review,
and
on
review
here.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
there
is
a
relationship,
mr.
chief
justice.
but
even
quite
apart
from
rooker-feldman,
that
is,
it
is
true
that
part
of
the
limit
that
they
derive
is
that
if
you
really
seek
to
review
the
merits
of
the
judgment,
rather
than
something
that
you
can
carve
out,
then
rooker-feldman
will
stand
in
the
way.
they
did,
of
course,
try
to
review
the
merits
of
the
judgment.
they
asked
the
district
court
to
retain
jurisdiction
over
the
entire
matter.
but
that
is
not
sufficient
protection
for
a
doctrine
that
would
essentially
make
every
private
litigant
a
state
actor,
because
that
problem
will
arise
even
outside
the
anti-injunction
act
context.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
we
think
it's
certainly
as
strong,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i
mean,
under
the
rooker-feldman
point
it's
not
just
those
two
decisions;
it's
the
very
fundamental
point
that
the
kind
of
relief
they
got
is
quintessentially
appellate,
a
stay
in
aid
of
jurisdiction.
the
second
circuit
i
think
may
have
been
confused
here.
it
cited
the
nebraska
press
opinion
of
justice
blackmun
in
chambers,
saying
that
it's
not
enough
to
be
able
to
come
straight
up
because
when
the
state's
highest
court
drags
its
feet,
as
they
keep
saying
they
fear
the
courts
of
texas
would
do,
there
is
no
way
to
get
relief
here.
but
that
isn't
true.
i
mean,
on
the
very
facts
of
nebraska
press,
when
the
state
supreme
court
delayed,
as
when
the
michigan
supreme
court
delayed,
there
was
relief
here.
and
we
don't
think
congress
has
ever
conferred
the
kind
of
pseudo-original,
pseudo-appellate
jurisdiction
to
win
stays
in
aid
of
appeal
without
any
exhaustion,
by
analogy
to
monroe
v.
pape
and
patsy
v.
board
of
regents.
now,
one
of
the
reasons
that
the
limiting
principle
question
is
so
fundamental
goes
to
justice
white's
question
about
younger,
the
question
of
how
far
our
theory
of
the
younger
case
carries
you.
are
we
committed
to
the
view
that
in
every
civil
proceeding
you
might
have
a
younger
problem?
it
really
depends
on
the
lawsuit.
certainly
if,
as
in
juidice,
which
was
an
ordinary
private
debt
matter,
you
sue
a
state
official,
which
they
carefully
chose
not
to
do
to
avoid
younger,
the
fact
that
the
underlying
proceeding
was
purely
civil
does
not
deprive
the
state,
new
york
in
that
case,
of
a
fundamental
interest
in
enforcing
its
judgment.
but
the
reason
you
don't
get
to
the
younger
issue,
justice
white--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--if
you're
trying
to
block
the
enforcement
of
a
judgment,
we
think
that's
right.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
but
ordinarily
you
wouldn't
get
the
federal
court
to
reach
the
younger
issue,
because
2283
would
be
a
bar.
that
is,
unless
you
accept
their
absolutely
all-engulfing
state
action
theory.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
that's
true.
but
it
seems
to
us
that
the
fundamental
reason
that
younger
does
not
begin
to
consume
the
universe,
even
on
our
view
of
the
matter,
is
that
in
most
ordinary
civil
litigation
2283
is
a
bar
to
injunctive
interference,
but
there
is
no
bar
and
no
1983
entre.
let
me
quickly
turn
to
the
other
area
where
i
don't
think
they
have
provided
a
limiting
principle,
and
that
is
on
the
merits.
we
did
stipulate
in
the
texas
courts,
and
we
repeat
it
now,
that
we
are
happy
to
live
with
flexible
arrangements
analogous
to
those
under
rule
62.
we
don't
demand
in
this
case
the
full
security
to
which
we
think
we
might
be
entitled.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
well,
because
it's
not
in
our
interest
to
see
them
driven
into
bankruptcy,
justice
stevens.
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
we
want
to
get
paid,
but
we
don't
want
to
have
the
world
come
crashing
down.
and
even
though
bankruptcy
isn't
a
boogeyman,
we're
interested
in
a
reasonable
accommodation.
but
what
they
did
was
go
to
a
set
of
courts
that
couldn't--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--i
think
efforts...
i'm
told
efforts
have
been
made
about
that.
but
the
point
really
is
that
their
theory
says
that
if
you're
solvent...
and
they're
quite
solvent,
as
they
point
out...
if
you
are
solvent,
then
no
security
is
needed.
well,
that
doesn't
answer
the
priority
question
justice
o'connor
asked,
and
it
doesn't
answer
justice
rehnquist's
question
when
the
chief
justice
said,
what
about
later
creditors.
that
was
what
the
district
court
said
was
the
real
problem
here,
other
creditors
could
come
in.
now,
mr.
boies
seems
to
have
a
crystal
ball.
he
says
no
real
problem.
the
only
courts
in
a
position
to
assess
that
are
the
courts
of
texas,
where
this
case
clearly
belongs.
now,
justice
white
says,
isn't
impossibility
a
limiting
principle?
you
know,
when
something
is
impossible
it
hardly
matters
if
it's
relatively
impossible
or
absolutely
impossible.
if
you're
just
a
poor
farmer
who
can't
make
liquid
assets
out
of
that
land
in
iowa,
it's
just
as
impossible
for
you
as
it
is
for
texaco.
we
do
not
argue--
mr.
laurence
h.
tribe
--well,
it's
only
impossible
in
a
metaphysical
sense.
but
the
impossibility
that
counts
constitutionally
is
whether
you
can
put
the
money
together,
and
they've
never
really
answered
that.
it
seems
to
us
we're
not
arguing
that
the
due
process
clause
shouldn't
apply
to
huge
corporations,
but
we
are
arguing
that
a
kind
of
dow-jones
due
process,
where
only
huge
corporations
can
take
advantage
of
the
principle
by
escalating
to
absolute
impossibility,
is
untenable.
so
that
neither
jurisdictionally
nor
substantively
do
they
offer
this
court
any
way
to
rule
for
them
without
setting
a
terrible
precedent.
this
case
is
colorful
today
because
of
the
dollar
figures,
but
it
will
long
be
remembered
for
a
different
reason.
the
question
will
be:
were
fundamental
principles
of
federalism
and
due
process
bent
and
twisted
to
make
a
special
deal
for
huge
corporations?
we
don't
think
they
should
be.
