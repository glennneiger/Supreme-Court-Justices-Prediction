justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
this
is
very
close,
though,
to
lugar
versus
edmondson
oil,
isn't
it,
in
terms
of
asking
what's
under
color
of
state
law?
i
didn't
happen
to
support
that
judgment,
but--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--it
seems
to
me
that
this
is
a
pretty
close
relative
of
lugar.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
it
isn't
altogether
clear
what
proceeding
was
enjoined
by
the
district
court,
is
it?
i
mean,
there
wasn't
a
proceeding
going
on,
was
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
tribe,
it
isn't
all
that
clear
to
me
at
least
what
might
have
been
available
in
texas.
do
you
think
a
pullman
type
abstention
might
have
been
available
or
appropriate
for
a
federal
district
court
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
boies,
i
guess
that
doesn't
answer
their
priority
argument,
though,
does
it?
that
the
purpose...
the
filing
of
the
post-judgment
request
put
their
priorities
in
place.
