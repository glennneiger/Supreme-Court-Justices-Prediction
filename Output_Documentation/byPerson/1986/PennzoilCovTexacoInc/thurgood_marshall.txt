justice
thurgood
marshall
under
this
case,
could
you
go
shopping
in
hawaii
and
anchorage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
--under
1983.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
they
don't
have
jurisdiction
under
1983,
what
do
they
have
jurisdiction
under?
justice
thurgood
marshall
mr.
tribe,
you
said
if
this
case
goes
back
to
the
texas
courts.
isn't
it
still
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
where
do
you
get
jurisdiction
in
white
plains?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
so.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
could
you
have
filed
it
in
anchorage?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yes,
sir.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
then
go
from
there
to
honolulu
while
you're
at
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what's
the
difference?
why
is
new
york
so
peculiar?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
admit
you're
shopping?
you
admit
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
the
record?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
litigate.
when
they
try
to
enforce
it,
you
litigate
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
isn't
that
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
or
are
you
just
going
to
pay
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
you
do
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
didn't
you
use
the
federal
forum
in
texas?
you
knew
they
have
district
courts
down
there.
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
venue
statute
on
injunctions
clearly
gave
you
that
right?
what
venue
statute?
the
bankruptcy
venue
statute
doesn't
apply
to
an
injunction
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
can
you
survive
here
without
the
1983
claim?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
how
do
you
get
under
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
really
think
1983
was
passed
to
protect
multi-million
dollar,
billion
dollar
corporations?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
it
only
applies
to
a
multi-billion
dollar
corporation.
well,
you
have
said
it
several
times.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
said
that's
the
basis,
because
it's
so
much
money
involved.
now,
there's
no
statute
on
that.
there's
no
statute
that
says
a
fat
cat
wins
and
a
small
cat
loses.
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
your
state
action
the
action
of
the
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
is
it?
what
is
the
state
action
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
they're
not
before
your
court.
they're
not
in
white
plains.
justice
thurgood
marshall
without
lugar
are
you
lost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
suppose
lugar
was
distinguished.
would
you
be
lost?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
else
would
you
have.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
else
would
you
have?
justice
thurgood
marshall
your
state
action
is
an
appealable
order,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
it
is
in
this
case,
it
is
an
appealable
order?
well,
i'll
finish
my
sentence.
and
instead
of
appealing
it,
you
go
to
white
plains.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
an
action
of
a
state
court
is
not
appealable
to
any
court
in
the
state,
right?
justice
thurgood
marshall
because
if
not,
it's
appealable
here.
