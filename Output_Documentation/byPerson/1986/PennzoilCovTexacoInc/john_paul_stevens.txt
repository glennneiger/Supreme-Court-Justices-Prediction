justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
tribe,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
on
state
action.
supposing
that
texas
had
the
procedure
that
it
has
for
corporations
that
are
owned
by
yankees,
but
all
other
corporations
and
southerners
have
a
right
to
appeal
without
posting
any
bond
at
all.
would
there
be
state
action
that
you
could
challenge
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
that
really
isn't
my
question.
that's
really
a
different
answer...
i
mean,
a
different
line
of
argument.
would
there
have
been
state
action
if
you
brought
a
1983
challenge
against
the
procedure
on
those
facts?
i
think
your
answer
would
be
no.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
think
you
said
earlier
to
justice
scalia,
even
if
you
sued
the
right
functionaries
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
boies,
can
i
ask
you
a
question,
if
your
three
elements,
your
necessity,
impossibility,
and
so
forth,
justify
this
extraordinary
relief.
it
seems
to
me
that
those
basic
allegations
could
be
made
in
quite
a
number
of
cases
involving
smaller
companies
having
difficulty
getting
the
security
for
an
appeal,
but
might
go
into
bankruptcy
just
meeting
the
timing
problem.
that's
not
unique
to
this
situation.
do
you
think
that
the
size
of
the
company
has
anything
to
do
with
the
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
any
time
a
litigant
who
is
having
a
great
deal
of
difficulty
posting
appropriate
security
could
make
comparable
allegations,
it
has
a
1983
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
could
make
the
allegations
an
is
entitled
to
a
hearing
on
those
allegations,
that's
what
i
really
should
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
word
for
word
the
same
as
yours,
except
we're
a
grocery
store
and
we
own
some
vacant
land
out
in
iowa.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
will
go
into
bankruptcy
if
we
have
to
pay
this
judgment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
we
can't
sell
the
farm
that
fast.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
size
relative
to
the
amount
of
assets
you
can
readily
accumulate.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
in
my
hypothetical
i
just
have
bonding
companies
don't
particularly
want
to
do
business
with
us
based
on
just
this
iowa
asset.
there
are
a
lot
of
situations
where
it's
hard
to
get
a
bond.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
they
say
in
due
course
we
can
liquidate
this
assets,
we
go
into
bankruptcy
and
there'll
be
plenty
of
money
to
pay
the
judgment.
you
have
to
have
that,
too,
i
assume.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
plaintiff
alleges
absolute
impossibility
in
each
case
and
then
he's
got
to
prove.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not?
justice
john
paul
stevens
don't
you
just
want
to
get
paid?
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you're
that
reasonable,
maybe
you
could
have
settled
this
dispute
and
not
taken
our
time.
[laughter]
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
says
it's
only
impossible
if
the
judgment
exceeds
the
bonding
capacity
of
the
whole
world.
