mr.
ira
drogin
mr.
chief
justice,
and
say
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
issue
of
whether
and
under
what
circumstances
an
employer,
purchasing
the
assets
of
a
defunct
business
enterprise,
must
recognize
a
labor
union
which
represented
the
employees
of
its
predecessor,
the
former
assets
owner.
it
is
to
be
distinguished
immediately
from
those
cases
in
which
a
going
business
was
purchased,
substantially
intact
and
operational,
and
in
which
the
new
owner
retained
or
quickly
employed
a
majority
of
the
employees
of
the
former
assets
owner.
this
court
must
decide--
mr.
ira
drogin
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
eventually
that
occurred.
that
occurred
at
two
different
time
periods
and
i
am
going
to
get
to
that
if
i
may.
this
court
must
decide
whether
fall
river
should
be
considered
a
successor
for
the
purposes
of
collective
bargaining
when
the
employees
of
its
predecessor
constituted
a
minority
of
all
of
the
employees
of
fall
river
at
the
full
complement
date,
but
also
when
the
employees
of
the
predecessor
constituted
a
majority
at
an
earlier
date,
the
substantial
complement
date.
we
have
some
guidance
from
this
court
in
how
to
approach
this
particular
issue,
and
if
i
may
quote
very
briefly
from
the
opinion
of
this
court
in
howard
johnson:
this
court
held
that
the
real
question
in
each
of
these
successorship
cases
is
on
the
particular
facts,
what
are
the
legal
obligations
of
the
new
employer
to
the
employees
of
the
former
owner
or
their
representative.
the
answer
to
this,
according
to
this
court,
requires
an
analysis
of
the
interests
of
the
new
employer
and
the
employees,
and
of
the
policies
of
the
labor
laws
in
light
of
the
facts
of
each
case
and
the
particular
legal
obligation
which
is
at
issue,
whether
it
be
the
duty
to
recognize
and
bargain
with
the
union,
the
duty
to
remedy
unfair
labor
practices,
et
cetera.
mr.
ira
drogin
i
certainly
do,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
drogin
i
am,
indeed,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
substantial
and--
mr.
ira
drogin
--i
think
the
answer
is
both.
i
think
that
there
is
no
rational
basis
for
the
decision
of
the
board
here,
and
i
am
also--
mr.
ira
drogin
--that
is
right.
i
think
that
there
is--
mr.
ira
drogin
--yes,
i
am,
your
honor.
i
am
asking
that.
i
think
that
the
legal
issues
deal
with
the
interplay
of
three
specific
propositions.
they
are
the
fact
that
the
board
here
has
applied
the
substantial
and
representative
complement
test,
completely
ignoring
what
this
court
said
in
burns,
that
there
may
be
situations
at
which
the
time
for
determining
the
majority
status
of
the
employees
involved
in
the
successor
may
not
be
available,
or
may
not
be
appropriate
until
a
full
complement
of
employees
has
been
hired.
in
this
situation,
we
had--
mr.
ira
drogin
--yes,
in
a
slow
build-up
situation.
most
of
the
cases
that
this
court
has
had
before
it,
wiley,
burns,
howard
johnson,
involve
situations
where
the
unit
was
taken
over
virtually
intact
with
virtually
all
of
the
employees,
and
there
was
no
hiatus
involved.
this
case
differs
substantially,
factually--
mr.
ira
drogin
--i
would
think
that
you
have
to
determine
at
the
outset
what
the
employer's
plans
are
and
when
the
full
complement--
mr.
ira
drogin
--in
a
situation
where
there
is
a
slow
buildup,
and
particularly,
your
honor,
in
a
situation
such
as
here
where
there
is
no
rational
or
factual
basis
for
the
underlying
presumption
that
the--
mr.
ira
drogin
--unless,
your
honor,
the
takeover
is
a
takeover
of
a
going
business--
mr.
ira
drogin
--virtually
intact,
virtually
the
entire
labor
force,
but
not
in
a
slow
buildup
situation
where
there
is
an
assets
purchase.
mr.
ira
drogin
well,
that's
an
assumption.
that
assumes
that
if
that
75
percent--
mr.
ira
drogin
--certainly
not.
but
you
have
to
accept
an
assumption--
mr.
ira
drogin
--that
is
correct.
it
is
possible.
the
problem
in
this
case
is
that
there
is
an
underlying
assumption
here
that
at
the
time
of
the
demand,
at
the
time
that
the
demand
was
made
at
this
case,
and
the
time
that
the
measuring
period
was
applied,
in
this
case
by
the
board,
the
substantial
complement
date
which
was
seven
months
at
least
from
the
time
of
the
closing
of
this
plant
and
the
laying
off
of
150
employees,
that
representation
wishes
of
the
former
employees
of
sterlingwale
had
not
changed
and
that
is
completely
unsupported
by
the
record.
this
court
has
always
been
concerned
with
the
paramount
principle
of
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
that
is
the
policy
of
majority
representation.
it
has
been
concerned
that
employees
are
not
bound
by
a
representative,
a
majority
of
them,
by
a
representative
not
of
their
own
choosing.
and
in
this
situation,
quite
different
than
burns,
there
was
no
recent
certification.
in
the
burns
case
there
was
a
certification
of
the
bargaining
representative
only
three
months
before
the
takeover.
here,
not
only
was
there
no
certification
but
over
a
bargaining
history
of
more
than
20
years,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
record
that
there
was
recognition
based
on
any
showing
of
majority
support.
the
assumption,
or
presumption
that
we
start
with
a
majority
in
this
time
carryover
rests
entirely
on
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
which
has
a
union
security
provision
which
requires
all
employees
to
be
members
of
the
union
30
days
after
their
employment.
mr.
ira
drogin
certainly
not.
i
think,
however,
that
one
of
the
concerns
of
burns
was
the
implicit
assumption
with
regard
to
representation.
that
there
is
a
carryover
that
every
employee
in
the
predecessor
employer's
employ
who
was
a
member
of
the
union
still
wants
to
be
represented
by
that
union
seven
months,
ten
months,
11
months,
however
many
months
afterwards
in
this
type
at
situation
that
person
is
employed?
mr.
ira
drogin
within
a
year
before--
mr.
ira
drogin
--not
the
transfer.
mr.
ira
drogin
before
the
full
complement,
your
honor.
i
would
think
that
the
full
complement
date
in
a
slow
buildup
situation
is
the
appropriate
date.
i
think
that's
what
this
court
had
in
mind
in
burns
when
it
said
that
there
may
be
situations
and
circumstances
in
which
it's
not
evident
until
a
full
complement
has
been
employed,
that
the
union
does
have
majority--
mr.
ira
drogin
--well,
certainly,
your
honor.
the
union
is
protected
by
certain
presumptions
that,
for
example,
one
year...
there
are
no
representation
petitions
to
be
filed
one
year
after
its
certification.
its
contract
protects
it
for
a
period
of
time
afterwards,
and
there
is
a
continuing
presumption--
mr.
ira
drogin
--yes,
and
that
is
quite
interesting,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
drogin
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
burns.
mr.
ira
drogin
i
think
that
that's
the
proper
rule.
mr.
ira
drogin
no,
not
every
year,
your
honor.
mr.
ira
drogin
well,
it's
not
a
question
of
the
union
protecting
itself.
that's
not
the
interest
that
we
are
seeking
to
protect.
the
interest
that
the
statute
has
us
protect
is
the
right
of
employees
to
be
represented
by
a
union
of
their
choice.
mr.
ira
drogin
well,
here,
your
honor,
we
have
a
very
unusual
situation.
mr.
ira
drogin
because
the
union,
for
all
intents
and
purposes,
was
gone
from
the
picture.
after
its
contract
expired
in
april
of
1982--
mr.
ira
drogin
--pardon
me,
your
honor?
mr.
ira
drogin
i'm
not
going
behind--
mr.
ira
drogin
--that
is
a
factual
statement.
that
is
correct.
the
contract
expired
on
april
1st,
1982
and
there
was
no
attempt
to
renew
it
by
the
union
because
the
employer,
sterlingwale,
was
being
liquidated.
it
was
defunct.
it
was
selling
off
its
assets.
it
was
a
dead,
moribund
company
and
that
is
the
distinguishing
point
between
this
case
and
burns
and
wiley
and
howard
johnson
and
golden
state.
in
those
situations
there
was
at
least
an
expectation,
an
immediate
expectation
on
the
part
of
the
employees
of
the
former
employer
that
there
would
be
some
kind
of
carryover
of
bargaining
representative.
mr.
ira
drogin
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
correct,
and
in
this
particular
case
that
was
not
hard
to
determine
because
the
employer
had
immediate
plans.
his
plans
worked.
he
stuck
with
those
plans.
the
job
required
that
two
shifts
be
put
on
as
the
business
increased.
the
employer
projected
an
april
full
complement
date.
that
is
exactly
the
way
that
it
worked,
with
a
slow
and
gradual
buildup.
now,
it
is
argued
that
the
union
doesn't
know,
or
how
can
the
union
know.
the
answer
to
that
is,
all
they
have
to
do
is
ask
and
there
is
nothing
that
prevents
the
employer
from
giving
this
information
to
the
union.
if
they
refuse,
if
the
employer
refuses,
which
would
not
be
the
case
in
this
situation,
then
certainly
the
union
can
file
a
representation
petition
with
the
national
labor
relations
board
and
in
the
board's
investigation
and
procedures,
that
information
is
going
to
be
forthcoming.
so,
there
is
no
prejudice
to
the
union.
mr.
ira
drogin
including
the
parent
company
of
fall
river,
slightly
more
than
50
percent.
excluding
the
parent
company,
it
is
about
30
percent.
however,
there
is
no
real
way
of
determining
how
much
of
that
was
finishing
customers
and
how
much
of
that
was
converting
customers.
mr.
ira
drogin
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
the
new
company
is
strictly
a
finishing
company,
does
no
converting
work
at
all.
the
old
company
was
doing
approximately
70
percent
converting
work,
approximately
30
percent
finishing
work.
the
new
company
made
no
attempt
to
acquire
any
of
the
customers,
the
finishing
customers,
that
30
percent
of
the
old
employer,
didn't
ask
for
any
customers
list,
didn't
take
over
any
trade
name,
did
nothing
other
than
purchase
the
physical
plant
and
machinery.
it
made
no
attempt
whatsoever
to
continue
the
business
of
sterlingwale.
mr.
ira
drogin
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
i
have
to
tell
you.
mr.
ira
drogin
under
the
massachusetts
law,
i
would
assume
that
it
was.
however,
your
question
poses
a
very
interesting
secondary
question.
in
addition
to
the
sale
of
the
secured
interests,
which
was
the
real
estate,
the
plant
and
the
equipment,
there
was
also
a
sale
of
the
remaining
unencumbered
assets
of
sterlingwale
and
in
that
situation
there
were
outside
bidders,
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
fall
river
acquired
only
about
one-third
of
those
assets.
mr.
ira
drogin
i
disagree
with
that,
your
honor.
that
is
what
the
board
argues,
that
it
was
formed
for
that--
mr.
ira
drogin
--pardon
me?
mr.
ira
drogin
the
board
argued
it,
that
it
was
formed.
they
argued
it
in
their
briefs.
i
don't
believe--
mr.
ira
drogin
--that's
not
my
recollection,
that
it
was
formed
for
that
purpose.
mr.
ira
drogin
that's
correct.
what
happened
is
uncontroverted,
and
that
is
that
the
principal,
mr.
friedman
of
fall
river,
had
nothing
to
do
with
sterlingwale
other
than
being
a
customer
himself
until
the
end
of
august
1982
when
he
was
approached
by
the
attorneys
and
other
persons
who
held
the
security
interest
in
the
assets.
mr.
ira
drogin
that
is
correct.
mr.
ira
drogin
he
did,
but
at
the
time
in
late
august
1982--
mr.
ira
drogin
--well,
i
think
that's
a
bit
of
an
overstatement,
when
you
say
that
they
formed
the
company.
mr.
friedman
actually
formed
the
company.
he
is
the
sole
shareholder.
mr.
chase
at
that
time
had
been
working
in
new
york
for
a
competitor,
a
competitor
of
sterlingwale.
sterlingwale
was
defunct.
the
record
shows
that
the
company
was
formed,
i
believe
on
august
31st.
that
is
when
the
certificate
of
incorporation
was
filed.
all
of
these
things
happened
simultaneously,
and
the
documents
in
the
record
indicate...
it's
a
rather
complex
situation
there...
that
fall
river
had
the
right
to
acquire
these
assets
at
a
particular
price.
and
what
we
have
here,
really,
is
an
assets
purchaser,
not
interested
in
the
employees
as
employees.
fall
river
made
no
attempt
to
go
after
the
employees
of
sterlingwale.
it
didn't
obtain
their
personnel
records.
it
didn't
obtain
any
lists
of
where
to
locate
them.
when
it
needed
employees
it
advertised
in
the
newspaper
and
that's
where
it
got
its
employees.
it
also
hired
employees
of
other
finishing
companies
in
the
fall
river
area.
and
this
distinguishes
this
case
very,
very
much
from
cases
such
as
howard
johnson
and
burns.
here,
after
employees,
150
production
employees
being
out
of
work
with
no
real
anticipation
of
ever
being
rehired,
they
see
a
newspaper
ad
from
a
completely
new
employer
and
that's
how
they
became
part
of
the
personnel
of
fall
river.
i
think
i
would
like
to
make
a
point
here
about
the
representation
wishes
of
the
former
sterlingwale
employees,
because
again
this
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
act.
what
happened
in
this
situation
was
that
when
sterlingwale
went
out
of
business
it
owed
premiums
for
life
insurance
and
health
insurance
for
the
bargaining
unit
employees.
it
hadn't
paid
them,
and
any
of
those
employees
who
wanted
to
continue
that
coverage
had
to
pay
it
for
themselves.
it
also
didn't
pay
severance
pay.
it
also
didn't
pay
vacation
pay.
in
the
interim,
in
the
several
months
while
fall
river
was...
excuse
me,
while
sterlingwale
was
in
control,
money
came
in.
the
sterlingwale
company
was
undergoing
a
slow
liquidation
and
the
money
was
used
to
pay
taxes
and
other
creditors,
and
even
when
the
assets
were
sold
at
the
end,
the
unencumbered
assets
at
the
end
of
august
of
1982,
none
of
that
money
went
towards
paying
the
employee
benefits.
so,
in
the
following
year
when
the
national
labor
relations
board
hearings
were
coming
up
the
employees,
the
former
employees
of
sterlingwale
heard
about
this
and
they
repudiated
the
union.
factually,
without
any
presumptions
being
used,
they
repudiated
the
union
one
they
had
the
former
secretary...
i
shouldn't
say
the
former...
the
secretary
of
the
union
circulate
two
petitions,
one
to
former
sterlingwale
employees
and
one
to
new
employees
who
were
non-sterlingwale
employees.
those
petitions
are
part
of
the
record,
and
they
say
clearly
that
those
employees
do
not
want
to
be
represented
by
sterlingwale...
pardon
me,
by
the
union.
and
the
reason
is
very
clear
from
the
record.
the
reason
is
that
the
union
did
not
get
the
employees
the
benefits
that
be
longed
to
them
under
the
contract.
that
is
a
very
good
reason
for
repudiating
a
union,
and
that
right
is
guaranteed.
that's
the
policy
of
the
statute,
that
employees
have
the
right--
mr.
ira
drogin
--well,
the
labor
board-apparently
unfair
labor
practice
charges
were
filed
with
regard
to
these
defaults
in
payment,
and
those
charges
were
dismissed
because
it
was
not
a
repudiation,
i
think
is
the
test
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
uses.
unless
there
is
a
repudiation
of
the
contract,
the
labor
board
won't
issue
a
complaint
with
regard
to
failure
to
pay
insurance
benefits
or
contributions
to
employee
benefit
funds.
that's
their
present
policy.
so,
they
were
dismissed
but
they
were
never
pursued
to
arbitration
and
there
was
money
there.
there
would
have
been
money
available
had
the
union
acted
promptly
and
the
employees--
mr.
ira
drogin
--the
proposition
that
i
am
addressing
this
to,
your
honor,
is
that
the
fundamental
policy
of
the
act
is
the
protection
of
employees'
rights
to
be
represented
by
a
union
of
their
choice.
in
this
situation
we
have
a
noncertified
union.
we
have
no
showing--
mr.
ira
drogin
--that
is
correct.
mr.
ira
drogin
well,
that's
the
whole
question,
whether
fall
river
is
required
under
these
circumstances
to
bargain
with
this
union
under
the
successorship
theory.
their
bargaining
demands,
the
union's
bargaining
demands,
is
concededly
an
unlawful
demand,
because
it
was
based
on
the
old
contract.
this
court
clearly
said
in
burns
that
even
if
there
is
a
successorship
finding,
that
the
successor
employer
is
not
bound
by
the
old
contract.
nevertheless,
that's
what
happened
here.
mr.
ira
drogin
i
don't
know
if
they
made
that
as
a
factual
finding.
mr.
ira
drogin
well,
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it's
second-guessing
them
on
a
credibility
finding.
i
think
it's
evidence,
and
there
was
record
evidence
from
the
secretary
of
the
union
at
the
hearing
with
regard
to
the
changed
sentiments
of
the
members
of
that
bargaining
unit.
mr.
ira
drogin
i
think
the
reason
that
was
applied,
your
honor,
and
this
was
approved
by
the
court
of
appeals,
was
that
the
timing
of
the
petition
would
not
allow...
or
the
petitions,
rejection
petitions,
would
not
allow...
was
improper
because
the
board
and
the
court
said
that
the
petitions
had
to
have
come
to
the
attention
of
the
employer
before
the
substantial
complement
date
and
because
they
arrived
after
that,
yet
before
the
full
complement
date,
that
they
were
irrelevant
and
had
no
bearing
on
the
issue.
i
think
that
was
the
basis
for
rejection
of
that
evidence.
mr.
ira
drogin
well,
i
think
that,
your
honor,
the
harm
that's
done
is
that
the
employer
is
found
to
have
violated
the
national
labor
relations
act,
which
we
consider
a
violation
to
be
a
very
serious
thing.
mr.
ira
drogin
well,
there
is
no
monetary
fine,
of
course,
that
can
be
considered
by
the
board
in
further
unfair
labor
practice
proceedings
with
regard
to
the
remedy
that
may
be
applied.
should
fall
river
be
found
to
be
a
violator
of
the
act,
again
the
prior
record
is
important.
your
honor,
we
don't
want
a
suspended
sentence,
so
to
speak.
it
is
our
contention
that
we
didn't
violate
the
law
and
we
shouldn't
be
placed
in
a
position
where
because
of
the
uncertainty
of
the
substantial
complement
test
we
don't
know
what
to
do
on
a
day
to
day
basis.
the
board
itself
says
that
there
are
no
hard
and
fast
rules
for
determining
when
a
substantial
complement
has
been
employed.
the
board
admits
this
in
its
brief.
how
is
an
employer
to
organize
its
business
affairs
under
these
circumstances?
this
imposes
a
very
unfair
burden
on
an
employer,
particularly
one
who
is
an
assets
purchaser
simply
trying
to
operate
a
new
business.
i
would
like
to
reserve
some
time
for
rebuttal,
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time.
mr.
ira
drogin
thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
justice
scalla
has
put
his
finger
on
the
problem
from
the
employer's
interests
in
this
case,
and
that
is
that
we
come
to
a
completely
unrealistic
approach
and
result,
particularly
with
regard
to
the
continuing
demand
situation.
we
find
a
demand
initially
made
which
would
have
been
unlawful
for
the
employer
to
accept
because
at
the
time
that
it
was
made,
the
employer
did
not
have
in
its
employ
a
substantial
and
representative
complement,
whatever
that
may
mean.
the
demand
continued
to
be
an
illegal
demand
at
the
time
that
the
union
filed
unfair
labor
practice
charges.
it
also
continued
to
be
an
illegal
demand
at
the
time
that
the
national
labor
relations
board
issued
its
complaint
in
december
of
1982.
the
only
time
that
the
demand
became
legal,
according
to
the
continuing
demand
theory,
was
a
year
and
a
half
afterwards
when
the
administrative
law
judge
decided
that
in
january
1983
the
employer
had
reached
representative
complement.
now,
this--
