mr.
louis
r.
cohen
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
union
selected
by
the
members
of
an
appropriate
bargaining
unit
is
ordinarily
presumed
to
continue
to
represent
the
unit
unless
and
until
there
is
either
an
employee
petition
to
the
board
for
a
change
or
the
employer
can
demonstrate
by
objective
considerations
that
it
has
some
reasonable
grounds
for
believing
that
the
union
has
last
its
majority
status.
the
reason
for
this
indefinitely
continuing
presumption,
as
the
court
re-emphasized
last
term
in
the
financial
institution
employees
case,
is
that
after
the
initial
selection
the
law
greatly
prefers
stable
and
continuous
collective
bargaining
to
management
electioneering,
and
that
it
therefore
generally
bars
re-visiting
the
representation
issue
unless
and
until
there
is
affirmative
reason
to
believe
that
the
union
no
longer
commands
majority
support.
the
question,
whether
changes
in
ownership
of
the
employing
enterprise
affect
the
presumption
of
continuing
representation
was
answered
in
general
terms
a
long
time
ago.
under
a
well-established
board
rule
approved
by
this
court
in
burns,
a
change
of
ownership
does
not
affect
the
presumption
if
there
is
substantial
continuity
in
the
employing
enterprise
and
the
definition
of
the
bargaining
unit
remains
substantially
the
same,
and
a
majority
of
the
successor's
employees
in
the
unit
came
from
the
predecessor.
the
opinion
in
burns
does
refer
more
than
once
to
the
fact
that
there
had
recently
been
an
election
in
the
predecessor
unit,
but
i
think
that
none
of
the
weight
of
the
burns
decision
can
rest
on
that
fact.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
the
board's
test
for
substantial
and
representative
complement
is
whether
the
operation
is
in
substantially
normal...
the
enterprise
is
in
substantially
normal
operation
and
the
positions
have
been
filled,
and
the
board
says
that
it
also
takes
into
account
the
number
of
employees--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--and
the
likelihood
at
expansion.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
i
do.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
first,
i
think
the
board
did
properly
take
the
facts
into
account
here.
let
me
start
with
the
numbers.
on
january
15,
1983
when
the
board
determined
that
there
was
a
substantial
and
representative
complement,
36
out
of
55
employees
had
come
from
sterlingwale.
as
of
april
22
when
the
petitioner
says
that
it
had
completed
its
hiring,
by
my
count
based
on
exhibit
gc-8,
52
or
53
out
of
107
employees
in
the
unit
had
come
from
sterlingwale.
the
board
concluded
that
petitioner,
having
started
up
in
september
and
having
had
at
all
times
thereafter
until
late
in
march
an
absolute
majority
of
employees
who
had
come
from
sterlingwale,
and
being...
and
this
is
a
finding
of
fact...
in
normal
operation
of
a
full
shift,
and
saying
that
it
was
starting
a
second,
but
here
is
mr.
chase's
direct
testimony
on
that
point.
he
says
at
page
208
of
the
joint
appendix:
"our
plan
was
to
have
one
full
shift
operation
of
55
to
60
employees
and
after
we
reached
that
goal
then
we'd
see
how
business
would
be
and
then
we
had
planned
that
by
the
end
of
march,
april,
we
should
be
in
a
full
two...
shift
operation.
"
the
board
said:
"looking
at
the
problem
from
the
perspective
of
january
15,
the
employees
were
entitled
to
be
represented
on
that
date
when
the
business
was
up
and
running.
"
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no.
i'm
saying
that
the
board
didn't
have
to
treat
the
plan
as
firmer
than
mr.
chase
testified
that
it
was.
the
notion
that
there
is
a
neat
objective,
defined
in
advance,
that
the
petitioner
was
always
aiming
at
and
which
it
had
only
achieved
part
of
in
january,
is
largely
an
afterthought,
rather,
as
in
most
of
these
situations
in
real
time,
the
employer
is--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no.
the
hearing
was
at
the
beginning
of
may.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
they
were
looking
at,
first,
the
fact
that
there
was
at
all
times
very
substantial
continuity
in
the
bargaining
unit...
even
as
of
may
2nd
there
was,
as
i
say
by
my
count
they
were
only
a
half
a
sterlingwale
employee
short...
but
also
at
the
fact
that
as
a
successor
employer
starts
up,
its
ultimate
objection,
and
whether
it
will
get
there
may
not
be
clear
and
the
operative
rule
for
employers
and
for
unions
ought
to
be
that
when
the
enterprise
has
reached
substantially
normal
operation
the
employees
are
entitled
at
that
point
to
a
determination
of
their
right
to
be
represented.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
board's
rule
is
that
it
looks
for
a
majority
of
a
substantial
and
representative
complement
and
on
april
22,
as
i
says
there
was
slightly
less
than
a
majority.
but
let
me
also--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that
may
be.
i'm
not
sure
that
that
is
true,
that
that
is
true
in
this
case.
but
i
also
think
that
this
is--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
don't
think
that
the
employer
is,
in
fact,
in
any
such
puzzlement.
he
knows
that
he
has
taken
over
a
predecessor
employer
and
he
knows
that
he
has
so
far
hired
a
substantial...
a
majority
of
his
employees
from
the
predecessor's
rank
and
file,
and
he
knows
that
he
is
in--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--and
he
knows
that
he
is
in
substantially
normal
operation
and
he
knows
that
he
has
filled--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
was
going
to
say,
he
knows
that
he
has
filled
the
various
positions,
staff
positions
that
he
has.
"representative"
means
having
some
employees
in
each...
or
substantially
all
employee
categories.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
such
as
cutter
versus
finisher
versus...
not
supervisor
versus
non-supervisor,
but
the
categories
of
rank
and
file
employees
here,
people
who
work
on
different
machines,
work
on
different
parts
of
the
process.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
this
is--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--you
might
not.
you
might--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--this
is--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--converting.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
this
was
an
employer
who,
but
mid-january,
was
engaged
in
one
full
shift
of
what
he
wanted
to
do,
a
finishing
and
dyeing
operation.
he
had
hired
employees
in
all
the
categories
of
work
that
needed
to
be
done
in
that
shift,
and
the
employer
had
reason
to
knew
that
he
was
in
business.
it
is
true
that
he
was
going
to
see
how
business
would
be,
and
had
plans
to
add
a
second
shift.
but
it
this
had
been
an
initial
representation
situation,
i
think
the
board
under
well
and
long
established
board
cases,
would
have
said
it
is
appropriate
for
the
employees
who
are
working
on
this
first
shift
to
be
entitled
to
have
a
representation
determination
now
and
not
wait
until
the
employer
says
that
he
has
hired--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
that
might
depend
on
how
long
it
would
take
and
how
certain
it
was,
which
isn't--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
that
the
board,
in
weighing
the
right
of
employees
to
be
represented
during
a
critical
point,
in
staffing
up
against
whatever
considerations
favor
waiting
for
the
ultimate
electorate
to
be
formed,
might
well
say
employees
have
the
right
to
be
represented
on
the
way
up,
even
it
it
clear--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--in
this
case--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
that
the
employer
may,
in
your
case
or
in
this
case,
when
presented
with
concrete
evidence
that
the
union
no
longer
commands
majority
support,
seek
to
have
the--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes,
if
he
bargained
with
the
union....
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--at
an
earlier
stage,
and
he
will
get
it
if
he
can
present
to
the
board
concrete
evidence
of
a
loss
of
support.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
our
position
is
that
there
is
a
presumption,
and
that
the
presumption
carries
over
to
the
new
employer
in
a
situation
like
this,
but
that
where
there
is
no
recent
election
as
there
had
been
in
burns
the
employer
may
immediately
rebut
the
presumption
after...
whenever
it
appears
that
there
is
no
longer
majority
support
in
the
bargaining
unit
for
the
union.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
i
think
that
under
the
burns
case,
that
is
essentially...
that
the
burns
case
covers
that
and
that
the
burns
case
tells
us
that
there
is
sufficient
continuity
there.
but
that
is
not
this
case.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
the
board
has
a
seven-factor
test
and
as
to
each
of
the
seven
factors
which
have
been
endorsed
by
this
court,
there
was
either
total
or
very
substantial
continuity
here.
here
the
continuity
was
deliberate.
fall
river
was
founded
by
a
major
customer
and
a
vice
president
of
sterlingwale.
they
bought
the
production
facility
and
the
machinery
in
it
in
a
single
contract
and
not
on
the
open
market
and
not
via
foreclosure,
except
that
there
was
a
foreclosure
sale
to
see
whether
there
would
be
a
higher
bidder
for
the
equipment.
but
there
is
a
contract
which
appears
at
page
238
of
the
joint
appendix
among
the
founders
of
fall
river
dyeing
and
mrs.
anson,
the
widow
of
the
founder
of
sterlingwale
and
the
creditor
who
held
the
mortgage
on
the
production
building
and
the
creditor
who
held
the
mortgage
on
the
machinery
and
equipment
in
that
building,
and
by
contract
they
bought
it
all.
then
they
hired
12
supervisors,
11
of
whom
had
been
sterlingwale
employees,
and
they
hired
them
by
calling
them
on
the
telephone,
according
to
mr.
chase.
those
supervisors
then
selected
rank
and
file,
and
mr.
chase
said
each
department
supervisor
basically
knew
the
workers
or
knew
the
operation,
and
on
their
recommendation
we
did
the
employing.
this
was
a
deliberate
replacement
of
the
sterlingwale
commission
finishing
operation,
not
its
converting
goods
for
its
own
account
operation,
but
everyone
including
mr.
anson
testified
that
as
far
as
production
was
concerned
there
was
no
difference
between
the
two.
it
was
a
deliberate
continuation
of
the
earlier
operation
with
employees--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
that
the
result
is
not
different
if
you
end
up
with
all
the
pieces
together
the
way
they
are
here,
even
if
it
is
by
accident,
in
part
because
the
theory
is
not
that
the
successor
employer
inherits
obligations
of
its
predecessor
because
of
some
relationship
it
has
to
the
predecessor.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
or
the
board
could
and
the
court
of
appeals
could
determine
that
the
board's
finding
of
continuity
here
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
it
could
well
be
a
different
case
because
it
might
not
be
a
representative
complement
of
employees.
if,
on
the
other
hand...
if
on
the
other
hand
it
was
agreed
as
it
was
agreed
here
that
the
operation--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--was
more
of
the
same
and
that
the
same
bargaining
unit
definition
stipulated
that
the
same
bargaining
unit
definition
was
appropriate
for
the
successor
employer
here
as
for
the
predecessor--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
am
sorry,
i
tried
to
answer
before.
it
means
representative
of
the
various
jobs
that
are
within
the
bargaining
unit
definition,
so
that
you
have
some
employees
who
are
doing
each
of
the
things
that
the
bargaining
unit
will...
is
expected
to
do.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
well,
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
question.
well,
you
might
have
a
number
of
quite
different
jobs
in
the
same
bargaining
unit,
may
you
not?
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
this
case
would
be
quite
different
if
there
were
any
question
whatever
about
the
appropriateness
of
the
definition
of
the
bargaining
unit,
but
there
isn't.
in
this
case
it's
agreed
that
it's
the
same
definition
as
had
applied
before,
and
the
question
question
is,
do
we
have
enough
people
in
the
unit
and
are
they
sufficiently
representative,
and
is
the
operation
in
sufficiently
normal
status
on
january
15th
so
that
it
becomes
appropriate
to
say,
are
the
employees
entitled
to
representation
today
or
not.
the
question
would
be
essentially
the
same,
whether
the
determination
is
made
by
counting
the
number
of
employees
who
carry
over
from
the
predecessor,
or
is
made
by
an
election,
and
the
importance
of
ordering
bargaining
to
begin
at
about
that
point
is
that
the
employees'
rights
to
be
represented
at
all
would
otherwise
be
postponed
through
what
is
a
critical
period
in
the
enterprise
until
the
employer
says,
yes,
indeed,
i
have
now
finally
hired
my
last
employee,
now
let's
count.
let
me
say
just
a
word
on
the
issue
of
the
continuing
demand.
actually,
before
i
do
that
i
want
to
say
a
word
about
the
employee
petitions
here.
the
petitions
which
were
put
together
on
april
29,
three
days
before
this
hearing,
were
quite
clearly
identified
in
the
testimony
as
having
been
produced
by
a
fear
that
this
very
proceeding
would
take
three
years
and
that
the
employees
would
not
get
a
raise
until
it
was
over.
in
addition
the
alj
properly
rejected
those
petitions
on
the
ground
that
petitions
signed
on
april
29
did
not
have
a
bearing
on
the
issue
that
was
before
him,
which
was
the
obligation
to
bargain
as
of
january
15th.
the
board's
treatment
of
the
union's
demand
as
a
continuing
one,
and
as
therefore
outstanding
on
january
15
was,
i
think,
correct
as
a
matter
of
fact
in
law.
there
is
no
doubt
in
anyone's
mind,
was
no
doubt
on
january
15th
that
the
union
was
in
fact
still
demanding
recognition.
there
is
no
reason
to
require
a
union
to
keep
sending
demands
as
the
employer
staffs
up.
and
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
the
board's
sanctioning
a
procedure
under
which
the
union
makes
a
demand
when
the
employer
starts
operations,
and
that
demand,
if
not
ripe
at
the
outset,
attaches
whenever
the
employer
who
is
in
the
best
position
to
determine
the
facts
has
achieved
the
requisite
complement
of
employees,
if
the
requisite
continuity
of
both
the
enterprise
and
the
bargaining
unit
are
then
present.
the
employer
can,
i
repeat,
and
is
in
the
best
position
to
determine
when
he
is
in
substantially
normal
operation
and
has
a
representative
complement
as
it
has
been
defined.
the
suggestion
in
the
briefs
that
he
has
to
worry
about
jumping
the
gun
in
that
situation
seems
to
me
to
be...
and
suffering
an
8-a-2
violation
seems
to
me
to
be
farfetched
and
there
never
has
been
an
8-a-2
charge
in
any
such
situation,
recognizing
the
union
that
had
represented
the
employees
of
his
predecessor
and
there
is
a
majority
in
the
unit
at
that
time.
and
there
is,
with
the
tolerable
certainty
that
is
the
best
we
can
expect
in
any
such
situation,
i
think,
a
workable
ability
to
determine
when
a
substantial
and
representative
complement
has
been
achieved.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
if
i
may,
we
are
not
assuming
that.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
because
the
rule
of
law
here
is
that
there
is
a
presumption
of
continuity
until
there
is
a
contrary
showing,
and
the
dissent
in
burns
was
obviously
correct,
that
you
couldn't
tell
from
the
arithmetic
in
burns
whether
any
of
the
employees
had
in
fact
voted
in
favor
of
the
union.
nevertheless,
it
didn't
trouble
the
court
because
the
court
wasn't
making
a
new
affirmative
determination
by
proxy
of
actual
union
sentiment.
it
was
applying
a
continuing
presumption--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes.
thank
you.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's
correct.
we
didn't
know
until
the
administrative
law
judge
a
year
and
a
half
later,
in
1984,
told
us
that
we
should
have
recognized
the
union
and
bargained
with
them
in
january
of--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that's
correct,
but
how
are
we
supposed
to
comply
with
the
law
under
those
circumstances,
and
how--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--that
it
was
a
continuing
demand?
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
not
because
under
linden
lumber,
under
those
circumstances
if
the
employer
refuses
to
recognize
the
union...
excuse
me,
if
the
employer
refuses
to
recognize
the
union,
the
employer
has
no
obligation
to
go
to
the
national
labor
relations
board
to
file
a
representation
petition.
the
next
step
is
up
to
the
union.
if
it
thinks
it
has
the
30
percent
showing
of
interest
that's
necessary
to
get
its
foot
in
the
door,
then
it's
the
union's
obligation
to
go...
and
there
is
no
finding
of
violation,
there's
no
finding
of
violation
of
the
law
on
the
part
of
the
employer,
and
we
are
not
talking
about
a
successor
situation
now,
your
honor.
we
are
talking
about
an
ordinary
situation
where
the
union
comes
in
and
makes
a
demand,
and
here
to
compound
the
situation
the
demand
was
based
not
on
the
claim
that
they
were
a
successor
under
the
law
but
they
were
a
successor
under
the
terms
of
an
expired
contract
that
fall
river
had
nothing
to
do
with.
