what's
the
cutoff
mate
for...
you
would
abandon
this
argument
if
there
had
been
a
union
certification
election
within
a
year,
within
a
year
before
what--
justice
antonin
scalia
--a
year
before
the
transfer
of
ownership,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--within
a
year
before
the
full
complement?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
drogin,
i
have
been
thinking
about
your
answer
to
my
previous
question.
i
don't
see
how
it
can
work.
you
want
the
year
to
be
measured
from
the
full
complement
date,
but
you
don't
know
when
the
employer
is
going
to
reach
a
full
complement
until
he
finally
reaches
it.
so,
what
do
you
do
in
the
interim?
you
are
in
absolute
indecision.
you
don't
know
whether
you
have
to
deal
with
the
union
or
not.
it
can't
be...
it
surely
can't
be
the
full
complement
date.
you
must
mean
the
anticipated
full
complement
date.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
i
recall
correctly,
fall
river
was
formed
for
the
very
purpose
of
buying
these
assets,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
board
found.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
board
found.
did
the
board
argue
that,
or
did
the
board
find
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
was
not
part
of
the
findings
of
the
board
below?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
was
part
of
the
findings,
of
course
we'd
have
to
defer
to
it
unless
there
was
no
substantial
evidence.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
there
was
an
officer
of
the
defunct
company,
who
also
went
in
it
with
him,
isn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--the
vice
president?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
two
of
them
formed
this
new
company,
is
the
way
the
board
describes
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
drogin,
didn't
the
board
consider
the
expression
of
displeasure
with
the
union
that
you
are
referring
to,
and
didn't
the
board
think
that
that
could
be
explained
on
a
quite
different
basis;
to
wit,
that
these
people
weren't
approached
until
quite
late
on
and
they
thought
that
if
the
old
union
were
certified
and
went
ahead
with
its
unfair
labor
practice
complaint,
they
wouldn't
be
able
to
get
a
wage
increase
for
the
next
few
months?
didn't
the
board
consider
that
and
didn't
it
make
that
factual
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
this
is
a
credibility
point,
isn't
it?
how
can
we
second-guess
the
board
on
credibility?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
chose
not
to
believe
them,
and
they
thought
that
the
explanation
for
all
the
signatures
disapproving
the
union
that
they
got
was
was
simply
that
the
people
thought
if
they
approved
the
union
they
wouldn't
get
a
wage
increase
because
an
unfair
labor
practice
complaint
would
be
in
the
works.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
made
the
point
in
your
main
brief
that
it's
very
important
to
have
some
certitude
for
the
employer
as
to
when
the
test
of
majority
favoring
the
union
or
not
is
to
be
applied.
the
board
responded,
you
don't
need
certainty
because
there
is
really
no
harm
done.
if
the
employer
makes
a
mistake
he
won't
get
hit
with
a
penalty
anyway.
what
harm
is
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
there
is
no
penalty
imposed,
are
there
any
other
legal
effects
of
that
finding?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
agree
with
you,
mr.
cohen,
that
there
ought
to
be
a
clear
rule,
that
the
employer
ought
to
know
and
the
board
ought
to
know.
aren't
there
consequences
beyond
the
were
moral
opprobrium
of
being
cited
for
an
unfair
labor
practice
if
the
employer
doesn't
know
whether
he
yet
has
a
substantial
and
representative
complement?
for
one
thing,
isn't
it
the
case
that
if
he
fails
to
bargain
with
the
union
wrongfully
at
that
ineffable
moment,
whatever
it
is,
he
won't
be
able
to
have
an
election
for
the
next...
what
is
it,
the
next
year,
because
he
will
be
deemed
to
have
interfered
with
the
normal
process?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
we're
not
sure
about
it,
then
you
know,
your
brief
says
no
big
deal,
if
the
employer
makes
a
mistake
as
to
when
that
magic
moment
of
a
substantial
and
representative
complement
arrives,
nothing
happens
except
he
is
cited
for
an
unfair
labor
practice.
now,
you
say
it
may
well
be
that
in
addition
to
that
he
will
not
be
able
to
have
an
election
in
that
year,
for
another
year
because
of
his
good
faith
failure
to
realize
when
the
magic
moment
has
come.
that's
pretty
substantial.
justice
antonin
scalia
do
you
know
as
of
what
time
that
is
being
measured?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
substantially
normal
operation...
what
does
"substantial"
ad
"representative
complement"
mean?
representative
of
what?
representative
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--such
categories
as
what,
supervisor
versus
non-supervisor,
or--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
mean,
if
it
wasn't
just
a
separate...
another
shift
of
the
same
operation
that
was
going
to
be
added
here
but
rather
a
whole
separate
operation?
justice
antonin
scalia
then
you
wouldn't
have
had
a
substantial
representative
complement?
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes
or
no,
would
that
alone
have
been
enough
to
make
it
clear
that
it
was
not
a
representative
complement?
the
fact
that
the
other
half
of
the
business
he
was
going
to
add
was
a
totally
different
element
of
the
business,
it
wasn't
finishing...
what
was
the
opposite
of
finishing,
finishing
and
whatever
the
other
one
was.
justice
antonin
scalia
converting,
whatever
it
is,
would
that
have
prevented
it
from
being
a
representative
complement?
the
thing
is,
i
have
no
idea
what
the
board
means
by
a
representative
complement,
and
if
i
don't,
i
don't
know
how
an
employer
does.
if
he
doesn't,
i
think
he
is
put
at
a
very
unfair
risk.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
what
"representative"
means,
representative
of
the
various
bargaining...
see,
"representative"
means
nothing
to
me
unless
i
know
what
it's
representative
of,
representative
of
the
age
that
all
the
employees
are
going
to
be,
or
their
races
or
of
their
skills,
or
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
whether
or
not
the
jobs
are
all
in
the
same
classification
as
far
as
representational
obligations
are
concerned?
justice
antonin
scalia
okay,
so,
it
doesn't
hinge
on,
representative
of
the
various--
justice
antonin
scalia
--mr.
cohen,
why
shouldn't
we
give
some
weight
to
the
dictum
in
burns
where
we
did
stress
the
fact
that
there
had
been
an
election
within
the
prior
year?
i
mean,
what
we
have
here
is
one
hypothesis
heaped
upon
another
until
the
result
you
get
is
quite
unrealistic.
that
is
to
say,
we
are
assuming
that
it's
the
same
employment
unit,
and
there
are
a
lot
of
factors
that
go
into
that
so
we
give
the
board
the
benefit
of
the
doubt.
we
also
assume
if
you
hire
a
majority
of
the
employees
of
the
former
company
you
will
happen
to
hire
the
same
majority
who
favor
the
union
in
that
company,
that
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
not?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
began...
a
fair
description,
they
said
it
became
legal
when
it
reached
a
representative
complement,
now,
you
didn't
know
that
until
a
year
and
a
half
later.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
became
a
legal
demand
when
it
became
a
legal
demand
whether
or
not
you
knew
it
at
the
time.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
that
any
different
from
what
an
employer
who
is
starting
up
a
new
business
confronts?
let's
assume
that
you
hadn't
bought
this
business
from
anybody
and
you
were
just
beginning
to
build
up
your
worker
force,
and
a
union
came
in
when
you
were
just...
the
same
things
happened
as
here.
wouldn't
you
have
confronted
the
same
problems?
isn't
that
problem
unavoidable?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
no.
never
mind
the
continuing
demand.
wouldn't
you
be
at
risk
when
a
union
asked
to
be
represented
to
determine
whether
you
yet
have
a
representative
working
force?
wouldn't
you
be
at
your
own
risk?
