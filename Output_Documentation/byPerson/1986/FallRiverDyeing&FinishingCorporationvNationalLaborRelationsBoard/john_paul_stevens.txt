justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
just
so
i
understand
your
position,
assume
you
have
a
takeover
of
the
assets
and
no
employees,
and
you
add
20
employees
a
month
until
you
get
up
to
the
full
complement.
and
when
you've
got,
say
75
percent
of
the
employees,
say
it's
perfectly
clear
that
they're
all
union
members
and
they're
all
former
employees,
would
you
say
there
is
no
duty
to
bargain
until
you
have
the
full
complement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
would
assume
the
plans
are
to
keep
hiring
until
you
get
the
full
complement,
but
you
won't
have
that
done
for
another
three
or
four
months.
are
you
saying
there
is
no
duty
to
bargain
until
that
three
or
four
month
period?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
a
separate
question.
i
was
just
trying
to
isolate
the
question
about
the
point
at
which
you
measure
the
right
to
have...
the
union's
right
to
have
the
employer
bargain
with
it.
and
you
say,
you
just
done,
even
begin
to
have
a
duty
to
bargain
until
there
is
a
full
complement,
even
if
they
are
all
former
union
employees
and
former
employees
of
the
prior
owner?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
did
the
labor
board
deal
with
this
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i'm
just
a
little
puzzled
as
to
what
the
proposition
this
argument
is
directed
to...
what
proposition
of
the
law
does
this
support?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
had
been
recognized
for
20
or
30
years,
hadn't
they,
as
the
bargaining
agent
of
these
employees?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
give
them
a
different
a
lesser
right
to
bargain
on
behalf
of
the
employees
than
if
they
had
been
certified
just
more
recently?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen,
i
understand
you
are
saying
this
case
is
not
the
same
as
justice
powell's
hypothetical,
but
how
did
you
answer
his
hypothetical
if
the
employees
had
come
in,
in
response
to
newspaper
ads
but
you
got
60
percent
of
them,
were
former
employees?
would
the
result
be
different?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
for
this
purpose
we
can
just
look
at
the
numbers
and
we
don't
have
to
get
into
the
details
of
how
they
happened
to
get
hired?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
fact
that
in...
i
get
the
dates
a
little
mixed
up...
in
january
they
knew
they
were
going
to
the
full
complement
in
april.
did
you
answer
just
ice
scalia's
hypothetical
about,
instead
of
just
having
more
people
doing
the
same
thing,
they
were
going
to
add...
instead
of
finishing
and
dyeing
they
wanted
to
go
to
converting
or
whatever
the
other...
go
from
one
kind
of
fabric
to
corduroy,
but
the
addition
was
of
a
different
character
than
what
they
had
at
the
time.
would
that
be
a
different
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
just
more
of
the
same?
