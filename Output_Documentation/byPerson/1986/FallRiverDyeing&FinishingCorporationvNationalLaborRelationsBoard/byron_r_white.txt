--heard
enough
of
the
employees
of
the
former
owner,
that
a
majority
of
his
present
employees
are
those?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
if
he's
75
percent...
he
has
75
percent
of
his
complement
and
all
of
them
are
prior
employees,
when
he
gets
to
be
a
full
complement
there
is
still
going
to
be
a
majority
of
the
former
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean,
he's
not
going
to
fire
anybody?
he's
not
going
to
fire
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
in
this
case,
in
this
case
it
was
possible
but
not
in
the
example
i
just
gave.
in
this
case
it
was
possible
that
when
it
reached
the
full
complement
there
would
not
be
a
majority.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
would
you
say
that
either
in
this
case
or
in
an
initial
representation
case,
if
no
one
disputed
that
the
employer
was
going
to
add
a
second
shift?
let's
assume
the
board
found
he
was
going
to
add
a
second
shift
but
nevertheless
we
order
bargaining
because
a
majority
of
the
first
shift
are
old
employees.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
i'll
just
add
another
fact.
by
april
there
is
going
to
be
a
second
shifty
or
by
march
there
is
going
to
be
a
second
shift.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
that
is
your
position,
the
board's
position,
i
can't
imagine
that
if
it
so
turns
out,
when
the
second
shift
is
completed,
that
these
old
employees
are
a
distinct
minority,
can't
imagine
that
the
employer
would
be
foreclosed
from
asking
for
an
election.
justice
byron
r.
white
just
take
my
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
no
bar,
no
bar,
no
time
bar
on
it.
when
he
gets
his
second
shift
completed
it's
perfectly
clear
that,
to
him
at
least,
that
a
majority
of
the
employees
are
not
from
the
old
employer
and
a
majority
of
the
employees,
as
far
as
he
can
tell,
don't
want
a
union.
now,
can
he
then,
right
then,
even
though
he
has...
even
though
the
board
has
ordered
him
to
bargain
with
the
union
at
that
earlier
stage,
can
he
then
immediately
ask
for
an
election?
justice
byron
r.
white
will
he
he
get
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
different
than
an
assumption?
