mr.
drogin,
i
take
it
that
in
general
we
have
concluded
that
nlrb
findings
of
fact
are
going
to
be
treated
as
conclusive
unless
they
are
not
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
do
you
agree
with
that
as
a
general
principle?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
now,
what
are
the
legal
issues
if
any
that
you
think
are
in
this
case?
are
you
asking
us
to
change
some
legal
standard
that
the
board
employs,
the
substantial
and
representative
complement
test
or
anything
of
that
kind?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
isn't
clear
to
me
from
your
petition
and
the
statement
of
questions
whether
we
are
being
asked
to
review
the
case
to
find
out
if
there
is
substantial
evidence,
or
if
you
are
asking
us
to
employ
a
new
legal
test
or
standard
in
these
cases.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean,
there
is
no
substantial
evidence?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
you
are
asking
us
to
make
a
factual
determination?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well
you
think
we
should
adopt
a
rule
that
you
only...
you
time
the
inquiry
when
there
is
a
full
complement
of
employees
rather
than
a
substantial
and
representative
complement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
isn't
the
expectation
of
an
imminent
expansion
in
the
number
of
employees
a
factor
to
be
taken
into
consideration
in
applying
the
board's
substantial
and
representative
complement
approach?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
shouldn't
it
be
a
factor,
if
it
is
known
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
significant
expansion
in
the
number
of
employees?
isn't
that
something
the
board
should
take
into
consideration
in
applying
the
test,
when
you
have
one
of
these
successor
employer
situations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
all
right.
let
me
tell
you
what
troubles
me
about
the
board's
action
in
this
case,
because
i
would
appreciate
your
discussion
of
it.
fall
river
expected,
and
it
was
known
that
it
expected
to
double
the
number
of
its
employees
from
about
january
until
april,
it
planned
to
go
to
a
double
shift.
now,
the
board
seemed
to
look
at
this
situation
as
though
it
were
frozen
in
time
about
the
end
of
january,
and
given
the
fact
that
it
is
known
that
within
quite
a
short
time
they
expected
to
double
it,
do
you
think
the
board
really
took
that
factor
into
consideration
the
way
it
should
have?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
these
are
troublesome
cases,
and
the
reason
they
are
troublesome
is
because
the
employer
is
in
a
dilemma
here
about
the
timing
of
when
he
is
forced...
or
when
the
employing
unit
is
forced
to
look
at
the
situation
of
a
representative
and
substantial
complement.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
are
you
just
saying
the
board
didn't
have
to
give
credence
to
the
fact
that
they
planned
a
second
shift,
that
the
board's
decision
can
be
supported
on
the
ground
that
they
didn't
have
to
accord
credibility
to
the
plan
of
a
double
shift?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
when
was
the
board
looking
at...
the
board
wasn't
looking
at
it.
in
fact,
they
held
a
hearing
when,
long
after
this
had
happened?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
by
then
they
knew
that
a
shift,
a
second
shift
had
been
added,
so
why
weren't
they
interested
in
looking
at
what
really
happened?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
if
the
board
had
looked
at
the
situation
as
of
mid
or
late
april,
would
it
have
still
been
able
to
find
at
that
time
that
this
union
should
have
been
recognized?
