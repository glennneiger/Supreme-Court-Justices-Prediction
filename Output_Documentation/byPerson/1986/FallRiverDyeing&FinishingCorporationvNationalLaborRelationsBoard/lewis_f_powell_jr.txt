mr.
drogin,
to
change
the
subject
little
bit,
what
percentage
of
the
business
of
the
new
company
is
with
customers
of
the
old
company?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
did
the
new
company
carry
forward
both
aspects
of
the
old
company's
business?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
bankruptcy
sale.
was
the
new
company
the
only
bidder?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
would
have
to
be
the
high
bidder
under
your
law,
would
it
not?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question,
a
hypothetical
before
you
carry
on?
let's
assume,
for
example
that
when
the
old
company
went
out
of
business,
there
were
some
entrepreneurs
not
connected
with
the
old
company
who
thought,
"well,
there
are
some
customers
out
there
who
need
to
be
served.
"
"the
old
company
had
old
equipment.
"
"we
can
buy
new
equipment
and
perhaps
serve
them
more
economically.
"
the
new
company
then
advertised
in
the
newspaper
for
employees.
it
made
no
particular
pitch
for
the
employees
of
the
bankrupt
company.
what
would
be
the
situation
then
with
respect
to
the
duty
of
the
new
company
to
bargain
with
the
old,
defunct
union?
let's
assume
further
that
in
response
to
the
advertisement,
the
new
company
ended
up
with
a
majority
of
its
employees
who
were
members
of
the
old
union
and
had
worked
for
the
old
company.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
if
all
you
had
was
continuity
of
employees
that
resulted
from
public
advertising?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
is
all
you
need
continuity
of
employees
without
regard
to
any
other
facts?
