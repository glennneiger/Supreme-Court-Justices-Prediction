justice
antonin
scalia
it
didn't
say
that.
it
said
to
structure
the
distribution
system.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
quite
what
the
quote
you
read
said.
it
said
the
state's
power
to
structure
the
distribution
system,
which
is
much
more
closely
tied
to
the
importation.
one
imports
and
one
distributes.
it
is
very
easy
to
say
that
the
structure
of
the
distribution
system
has
a
very
close
tie
to
the
importation,
which
is
what
the
twenty-first
amendment
specifically
addresses.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
distribution
system.
justice
scalia
you
think
the
setting
of...
well,
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
going
to
be
arguing
later
when
you
address
the
scope
of
the
federal
government's
commerce
power
that
one
can't
stretch
things
to
infinity,
and
it
seems
to
me
you
are
arguing
a
very
broad
notion
of
what
importation
includes
and
distribution
includes.
it
includes
even
fixing
the
qualifications
for
purchasing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
have
to
say
the
same
about
the
soldier.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
does
that
tie
in
with
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
324
liquor
corporation
consistent
with
that
view?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
cohen,
apart
from
whether
it
can
contravene
the
state
law,
where
does
congress
get
the
power
to
do
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
the
the
spending
clause
case
that
you
think
is
closest
to
this
one
in
the
relationship
between
the
purpose
of
the
expenditure
and
the
condition
that
is
imposed
upon
receipt
of
the
funds?
the
purpose
of
the
expenditure
here
is
what,
improve
highways?
justice
antonin
scalia
germane
to
what?
mr.
cohen,
could
you
answer
my
question?
you
still
haven't
given
me
the
case
that
you
think
is...
i
don't
find
that
a
terribly
proximate
relationship.
we
are
building
highways
in
order...
i
guess
partly
to
increase
safety
of
travel,
and
one
of
the
things
that
impairs
the
safety
of
travel
is
kids
driving
somewhere
else
to
buy
liquor.
i
mean,
what
about
heart
attacks?
you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
heart
attacks,
so
a
condition
could
be,
the
states
have
to
have
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
congress
has
independent
powers
to
enact
civil
rights
laws.
you
don't
say
that
congress
has
independent
power
to
prescribe
drinking
age?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
has
to
do
with
the
efficient
expenditure
of
the
funds.
you
don't
want
the
funds
being
expended
by
political
hacks.
you
want
them
being
expended
by
what
the
federal
government
regards
as
responsible
civil
service.
that
is
closely
connected
to
the
use
of
the
funds.
this
condition
isn't.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
even
think
there
is
a
close
one.
justice
antonin
scalia
let
me,
since
you
can
spend
federal
funds
for
any
purpose
that
involves
the
general
welfare,
that
expands
the
federal
powers
into
anything
at
all
so
long
as
you...
the
federal
government
can
spend
money
for
art
and
suddenly
it
can
begin
conditioning
those
grants
to
get
the
states
to
do
things
in
the
field
of
art
that
it
would
have
no
independent
power
to
achieve.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
relates
to
the
expenditure
of
the
money.
obviously
any
condition
relating
to
the
expenditure
of
the
money
is
okay.
but
this
is
not
a
condition
relating
to
the
expenditure
of
the
money.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
even
condition
the
grant
on
every
state
that
adopts
a
unicameral
legislature.
that
is
not
a
personal
right,
individual
right,
so
that
is
okay,
you
can
condition
grants
on
that
so
long
as
it
is
as
germane
to
the
object
of
the
grant
as
this
one
is
germane.
justice
antonin
scalia
me,
too.
but
if
we
couldn't
it
would
be
okay.
