justice
sandra
day
o'connor
general
tellinghuisen,
would
you
explain
whether
you
think
this
case
might
be
moot
now?
south
dakota
has
changed
the
law,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
it
still
has
a
year
or
so
to
run,
a
year
to
run?
justice
o'connor
under
the
old
system.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
there
are
federal
funds
at
issue,
so
it
is
saved
from
mootness.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you
mean
provided
we
gave
the
twenty-first
amendment
the
broader
preemption
that
you
would
argue
should
be
given.
what
if
we
think
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
only
took
away
congress's
power
under
the
commerce
clause?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
disavow
the
argument
then
submitted
by
the
national
conference
of
state
legislatures
in
their
amicus
brief
to
the
effect
that
there
has
to
be
a
substantial
relationship
between
the
condition
imposed
on
a
grant
and
the
spending
of
federal
money?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
certainly
are.
you
can
say
it
is
right
or
it
is
wrong.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
you
lose
on
that,
and
this
court
is
having
to
grapple
with
it?
is
that
an
argument
you
make
or
is
it
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that
is
the
same
argument.
well,
the
argument
made
in
that
amicus
brief
is
not
one
of
coercion
at
all.
that
is
not
the
thrust
of
it.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
congress
could
bring
back
prohibition
under
your
view,
under
the
spending
power?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
i
mean,
you
think
the
states
have
no
power
derived
from
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
set
limits
on
the
age
of
drinking
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
power
under
the...
derived
from
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--to
set
drinking
ages.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
might
come
as
a
little
bit
of
a
surprise
to
the
drafters
of
the
twenty-first
amendment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
some
limit
then
on
congress
spending
power
of
a
requirement
of
germaneness
or
relatedness?
could
congress
enact
this
same
kind
of
a
grant
attached
to...
this
same
kind
of
condition
attached
to
a
grant
for
school
lunch
money,
for
example?
