mr.
louis
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
propose
to
argue
two
points.
first,
that
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
does
not
reach
this
case
at
all
because
it
does
not
say
that
congress
may
not
in
the
valid
exercise
of
its
own
powers
bar
or
encourage
states
to
bar
sales
of
alcoholic
beverages
that
a
state
might
prefer
to
permit,
and
second,
that
section
158
is
a
judicious
and
proper
use
of
the
federal
spending
power
that
does
not
violate
either
the
tenth
amendment
or,
if
it
is
applicable
at
all,
the
twenty-first
amendment.
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
prohibits
transportation
or
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages
for
delivery
or
use
in
violation
of
state
law.
it
thus
broadly
confirms
state
power
to
restrict
those
activities,
notwithstanding
obstacles
to
state
regulation
that
would
otherwise
be
imposed
by
the
commerce
clause
and
sometimes
other
provisions
of
the
constitution.
section
2
may
also
in
some
situations
prevent
congress
from
legislating
to
require
or
permit
activities
that
violate
state
law
although
in
every
actual
case...
i
think
of
crisp
and
midcal
and
324
liquor...
the
federal
statute
prevailed.
but
section
2
speaks
only
of
activities
in
violation
of
state
law.
i
suggest
that
the
words
simply
cannot
be
read
to
prohibit
congress
from
imposing
restrictions
of
its
own
or
encouraging
states
to
impose
additional
restrictions
on
alcohol
transactions.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
that
section
2
answers
that
question.
the
court
gave
a
partial
answer
to
that
question
back
in
1917
in
the
clark
distilling
case...
this
is
before
prohibition...
when
the
court
said...
this
is
242
u.s.
at
325...
"it
is
not
in
the
slightest
degree
disputed
that
if
congress
had
prohibited
the
shipment
of
all
intoxicants
in
the
channels
of
interstate
commerce
and
therefore
had
prevented
all
movement
between
the
several
states,
such
action
would
have
been
lawful
because
within
the
power
to
regulate
which
the
constitution
conferred.
"
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
it
was,
but
it
seems
to
me
that
if
you
take
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
its
two
parts,
the
passage
and
later
repeal
of
prohibition
didn't
change
that,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
the
plain
words
of
section
2
don't
change
that
either,
because
if
the
congress
were
today...
i
don't
suggest
that
it
is
politically
likely...
to
adopt
the
statute
that
was
envisioned
in
clark
distilling,
that
statute
would
not
involve
any
transportation,
importation,
delivery,
or
use
of
alcoholic
beverages
in
violation
of
state
law
and
therefore
would
not
be
prohibited
by
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
am
drawing
a
distinction
between
a
prohibition
and
a
protection
at
transactions
in
alcoholic
beverages
that
it
seems
to
me
section
2
draws.
congress
may
well
be,
although
the
court
has
never
actually
said
so,
may
well
be
prohibited
from
legislating
in
a
way
that
requires
the
state
to
accept
or
allow
alcoholic
beverages
or
alcoholic
beverage
transactions
that
the
state
chooses
to
prohibit
because
section
2--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
i
am
not
trying
to
make
just
a
wooden
plain
language
argument.
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
text
of
the
amendment
demonstrates
an
intention
to
protect
the
right
of
the
states
to
restrict
or
prohibit
or
tax
or
burden
the
delivery
or
use
of
alcoholic
beverages.
it
does
not
by
its
text,
and
i
think
it
should
not
be
interpreted
to,
bar
congress
from
imposing
additional
restrictions
that
don't
require
transactions
the
state
is
trying
to
prohibit.
the
text--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--in
this
case
what
congress
has
done
is
to
pass
a
statute
which
encourages
the
state
to
prohibit
alcoholic
beverage
transactions
that
the
state
chooses
not
to
prohibit,
sales
to
19
and
20-year-olds.
the
objection
is
that
the
state
has
some
sort
of
right
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
allow
those
transactions
to
take
place.
i
am
suggesting
that
if
you
read
section
2
it
doesn't
say
that.
i
further
suggest
that
the
source
from
which
that
text
was
drawn,
the
pre-prohibition
webb
kenyon
act,
which...
whose...
further
illustrates
the
point.
the
purpose
of
that
act,
which
was
clear
from
its
text
and
its
legislative
history
and
this
court's
explanation
of
that
act
in
the
clark
distilling
case,
was
to
withdraw
the
protection
of
the
commerce
clause
so
that
states
could
regulate
alcoholic
beverages
in
ways
that
might
be...
might
otherwise
be
objectionable
obstructions
of
commerce.
as
this
court
explained
in
craig
against
boren,
the
purpose
of
section
2
was
to
constitutionalize
that
framework.
it
was
not--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
think
so.
i
think
that
what
324
liquor
suggests
is
that
there
are
occasions
when
federal
law
may
conflict
with
state
efforts
to
restrict
or
impose
rules
on
transactions
in
alcoholic
beverages
where
federal
law
nevertheless
prevails.
but
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
properly
involved
in
the
325
liquor
case
because
you
had
a
state
activity,
namely
state
pricing
regulations
restricting
transactions
that
is
protected
by
the
amendment.
in
this
case
we
have
no
transportation,
importation,
delivery,
or
use
in
violation
of
state
law.
let
me
illustrate
with
an
example.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
that
is
not
what
i
am
saying.
first,
i
think
the
states
have
power
to
set
a
drinking
age...
police
power
to
set
a
drinking
age
wherever
they
like.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
the
states'
power--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
don't
think
the
states'
power
derives
from
the
twenty-first
amendment
at
all,
but
i
think
the
states'
power
is
protected
by
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
one
direction--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no,
because
congress
and
this
court
promptly
demonstrated
their
understanding
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
was
not
intended
to
restrict
the
otherwise
valid
exercise
of
congressional
power
to
impose
burdens
on
or
additional
restrictions
on
alcoholic
beverage
transactions
in
ways
that
do
not
require
a
violation
of
state
law.
congress
enacted
the
federal
alcohol
administration
act
in
1935
which
extensively
regulates
importation
and
manufacture
and
wholesaling
and
labeling
of
alcoholic
beverages.
that
statue
was
challenged
in
this
court
in
the
william
jameson
case
in
1939
on
the
ground
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
turned
the
whole
subject
over
to
the
states,
and
the
court
said
per
curiam,
summarily,
we
see
no
substance
in
that
contention.
i
suggest
that
what
would
have
startled
the
1935
congress
and
the
1939
court
would
have
been
a
suggestion
that
states
cannot
only
require,
say,
wholesalers
to
get
state
permits
and
apply
state-approved
labels,
but
can
also
insist
on
permitting
wholesalers
to
operate
without
federal
permits,
and
on
permitting
beverages
to
be
sold
locally
without
federal
labels.
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
the
parallel
here.
maybe
i
make
it
clearer
if
i
say
that
i
think
that
if
congress
were
attempting
to
encourage
the
states
to
lower
their
drinking
ages,
there
would
be
a
twenty-first
amendment
problem,
and
the
argument
that
i
am
now
making
would
not
be
applicable,
because
congress
would
be...
i
am
not
necessarily
suggesting
that
a
use
of
the
spending
clause
would
be
invalid
for
that
reason,
but
congress
would
be
encouraging
a
transaction
that
violates
the
state
law
as
it
now
stands.
what
we
have
here
is
something--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--yes.
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
congress
gets
the
power,
i
think,
under
the
spending
clause,
and
our
only
claim
is
that
they
have
the
power
under
the
spending
clause.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
let
me
interject,
because
i
want
to,
that
i
think
that
the...
i
think
that
that
question
is
not
before
the
court,
and
i
want
at
least
to
note
that,
although
i
am
going
to
respond,
i
am
going
to
respond
to
the
question.
the...
it
was
discussed
below,
but
the
state
didn't
raise
this
question
in
the
court
of
appeals,
and
it
is
not,
i
think,
comprehended
within
either
of
the
questions
presented,
and
i
note
that
the
state
says
in
its
brief
that
it
has
never
contended
that
the
congressional
action
was
unreasonable
or
unrelated
to
an
national
concern
in
the
absence
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
if
the
question
is
before
the
court,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
answer
is
first
that
the
expenditure
is
plainly
within
congress's
power
under
the
general
welfare
clause
and
second,
that
the
condition
attached
to
that
expenditure
is
within
congress's
power
under
the
necessary
and
proper
clause
because
it
is
sufficiently
germane
to
the
purpose
of
the
expenditure.
one
of
the
express
purposes
of
federal
highway
assistance
is
to
promote
safe
travel.
nevertheless,
one
of
the
consequences
of
this
expenditure
and
the
resulting
improvement
in
our
highway
system
is
to
exacerbate
the
problem
of
what
president
reagan
called
blood
borders
between
states.
section
158
is
a
measure
to
help
achieve
the
safety
purpose
and
combat
the
blood
borders
problem.
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
open
to
congress
to
decide
that
it
doesn't
want
to
provide
full
federal
funding
for
highways
in
states
where
those
highways
may
be
used
by
young
persons
in
lawful
quest
of
alcohol.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
the
answer
is
that
the
court
has
frequently
said
there
is
some
kind
of
a
limit
attached
to
the
spending
power,
and
to
my
knowledge
has
never
said
what
that
limit
is.
i
think
there
is
and
i
think
there
should
be
such
a
limit.
i
would
hope
congress
would
recognize
such
a
limit
on
its
own.
i
think
it
is
a
very
hard
line
to
draw.
but
i
think
it
is
appropriate
for
the
court
to
draw
a
germaneness
line.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
will
give
you
lau
against
nichols,
where
the
court...
where
congress
says
the
recipient
of
any
federal
grant
has
got
to
comply
with
the
civil
rights
laws,
and
that
ends
up
being
interpreted
to
mean
that
the
city
of
san
francisco
must
provide
some
means
for
educating
its
chinese-speaking
children.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
am
not
sure
that
it
has
an
independent
power.
i
don't
know
whether
it
would
have
had
and
it
certainly
wasn't
justified
in
that
case
on
the
basis
of
its
having
an
independent
power
to
impose
those
particular
requirements
other
than
as
a
condition
of
the
grant
of
funds,
but
i
will
give
you
oklahoma
against
civil
service
commission,
the
classic
case
in
this
area.
congress
provides
that
any
state
officer
or
employee
whose
employment
is
primarily
in
connection
with
any
project
that
is
funded
in
whole
or
in
part
by
federal
funds
must
satisfy
the
hatch
act's
requirements
with
respect
to
political
activity.
this
court--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
don't
think
that
the
connection
is
close.
there
is
no
perfect
analogy
to
this
case--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--to
this
case,
of
course,
but
in
civil
service
commission
the
court
pointed
out
that
the
united
states
has
no
power
to
regulate
the
local
political
activities
as
such
of
state
officials.
it
does
have
the
power,
said
the
court,
to
fix
the
terms
on
which
its
money
allotments
to
states
shall
be
dispersed.
there
is
no
evidence
in
that
case
that
the
particular
official
had
any
control
over
the
use
of
the
funds
or
that
the
basis
on
which
that
condition
is
sustained
is
that
it
applies
only
to
the
state...
certainly
the
statute
doesn't
say
so...
applies
only
to
the
state
officials
who
have
it.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
what
i
am
suggesting
and
this
is,
i
think,
not
a
particularly
well
developed
area
of
our
jurisprudence,
because
the
court
has
never,
i
think,
had
occasion
to
strike
down
a
condition,
but
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
the
condition
must
be
germane,
and
i
guess
i
mean
within
the
necessary
and
proper
penumbra
of
the...
germane
to
the
purpose
for
which
the
federal
funds
are
being
expended,
and
i
am
suggesting--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it
is
certainly
correct
that
the
federal
government
can
spend
money
for
art
and
that
it
can...
and
does,
and
that
it
can
do
that
in
order...
in
order,
among
other
things,
to
get
the
states
to
do
things
that
it
would
have
no
independent
power
to
achieve,
such
as
by
requiring
matching
grants,
such
as
by
requiring
that
money
provided
for
art
be
apportioned
so
that
members
of
minorities
or
handicapped
people
or
whatever
get
a
share
of
that
money.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes,
it
is.
it's
a
condition
that
says
we
don't
want
to
spend
federal
money
to
improve
highways
that
the
states
permit
to
be
used
by
teenagers
in
quest
of
alcohol,
just
as
congress
could
say
we
don't
want
to
spend
federal
money
on
a
school
district
that
doesn't
adequately
educate
one
group
of
its
children
without
regard
to
whether...
back
at
lau
against
nichols...
without
regard
to
whether
the
particular
federal
money
was
earmarked
for
that
purpose
or
indeed
whether
any
federal
money
at
all
was
being
used,
but
to
do
the
things
that
this
court
ended
up
ordering
the
san
francisco
school
district
to
do.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
oh,
certainly.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
oh,
certainly.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
there
is.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
would
agree
that
there
are
other
constitutional
restrictions,
and
that
if
the
twenty-first
amendment
is
thought
to
bar
this--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
first,
i
think
that
doing
that,
that
is,
moving--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
guess
i
don't--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
would
agree
that
that
one--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
would
agree
that
that
creates...
raises
a
twenty-first
amendment
question.
it
differs
from
this
case
because
there
the
state
is
seeking
to
prohibit
transactions
in
alcoholic
beverages.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
if
you
say
it
doesn't
violate
it,
yes,
then
you
have
an
issue.
i
don't
think
that
the
question--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--okay.
i
don't
think
that
the
question
is
the
same
as
the
question
whether
you
can
attach
a
condition
to
federal
funding
that
somebody
sacrifice
individual
rights.
i
don't
think
that
the
reserved
right--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--it
seems
to
me
that
all
of
this
court's
cases
holding
that
powers
reserved
to
the
states
under
the
tenth
amendment
may
be
waived
by
the
state
if
it
chooses
to
comply
with
the
condition
and
that
a
condition
that
may
encourage
a
state
not
to
exercise
a
power
that
it
had
under
the
tenth
amendment
is--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--i
am
suggesting
that
there
is
a
difference
between
the
protection
of
individual
rights,
as
i
think
you
have
eloquently
suggested
on
occasion,
between
the
protection
of
individual
rights
from
being
bargained
away
by
conditional
state--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the
twenty-first
amendment
protects
primarily
against
the
operation
of
other
clauses
of
the
constitution,
the
state's
power
which
it
otherwise
would
have
given
up
under
the
commerce
clause
and
so
forth,
to
restrict
transactions
in
alcoholic
beverages.
in
the
case
that
you
suppose
it
seems
to
me
that
the
position
that
the
state
is
in
is
not
dissimilar
from
the
position
the
state
is
in
exercising
a
tenth
amendment
power
which
it
has
in
which
the
federal
government
presumably
cannot
directly
constitutionally
take
away
from
it
but
which
the
federal
government
can
urge
it
to
exercise
in
a
particular
way
by
conditioning
a
federal
grant.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
would
hope
that
the
court
would
find
a
way
to
say
that
that
one
wasn't
germane.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
think
that
there
is
in
the
germaneness
test
the
possibility
of
saying,
look,
a
very
large
and
very
central
state
interest
can't
be
germane
to
a
very
small
federal
interest,
but
in
the
lead-deadwood
case,
the
court
did
at
least
observe
that
it
appeared
to
be
constitutional
for
congress
to
grant
money
on
the
condition
that
a
state
let
the
county
that
was
the
recipient
of
that
money
decide
how
to
spend
it
for
any
governmental
purpose.
in
oklahoma
civil
service
commission
the
court
did
say
we
are
entitled
to
decide
about...
say
that
congress
was
entitled
to
require
hatch
act
observance
by
state
officials.
those
are,
i
think,
federal
statutes
that
use
the
spending
power
in
a
way
that
is
at
least
as
intrusive
upon
core
state
governmental
interests
as
the
interest
that
the
state
of
south
dakota
has
in
permitting
19-year-olds
from
its
own
state
and
from
neighboring
states
to
drink
beer.
the
state
does
have--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
that
is
also
a
condition
attached
to
the
grant
of
federal
funds
for
highway
construction.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
might.
we
don't...
but
we
don't
make
any
such
argument
as
that
in
this
case.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
we
don't
argue
that
the
government
could
directly
say
that
each
state
must
adopt
a
minimum
drinking
age--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--and
that
is
what
the
government
did
do.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
would
think
that
some
power
to
police
interstate
highways
is
probably
implicit
in
the
commerce
clause,
yes.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
would
have
thought
that
should
congress
choose
to
do
so
the
court
would
sustain
that
as
a
valid
exercise
of
the
commerce
clause.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i'm
sorry?
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
no,
i
would.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
would
think
the
court
would
sustain
that
as
an
exercise
of
the
commerce--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--let
me
finish
by
saying
i
think
president
reagan
was
right
in
this
case
when
he
said
that
section
158
is
a
judicious
use
of
federal
power.
there
is
an
important
and
inherently
federal
interest
in
eliminating
the
incentive
to
drink
and
drive
that
is
created
by
differing
minimum
drinking
ages
between
states.
thank
you.
