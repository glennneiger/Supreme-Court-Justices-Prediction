mr.
cohen,
while
we
are
asking
hypotheticals,
could
congress
prescribe
the
driving
age
both
on
the
low
side
and
the
high
side
for
all
the
states?
in
other
words,
say
no
person
under
18
may
drive
on
a
federal
highway,
no
person
over
80
may
drive?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
say
you
would
not
have
thought
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
not
think
congress
had
the
power
to
do
that?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
you
would
think
so.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
congress
would
have
the
same
safety
interest
that
you--
--we
couldn't
get
a
quorum
to
hear
that
case.
