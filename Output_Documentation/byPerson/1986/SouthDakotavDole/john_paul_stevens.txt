justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
attorney
general,
could
i
go...
i
want
to
be
sure
i
understood
your
answer
correctly.
i
think
justice
white
asked
you...
maybe
this
is
a
variation
of
the
question.
you
say
congress
passed
a
statute
saying
it
shall
be
unlawful
for
any
purveyor
of
liquor,
either
in
a
bar
or
so
forth,
to
sell
liquor
to
a
uniformed
soldier.
you
say
that
would
be
unconstitutional.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
was
going
to...
let
me
give
you
another
one
that
is
similar.
supposing
they
required
all
interstate
truck-drivers
and
bus
drivers
to
wear
some
kind
of
an
identifying
cap
or
uniform
of
some
kind
and
they
said,
you
may
not
sell
liquor
to
any
of
those
drivers
of
interstate
vehicles.
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
just
say
flatly,
it
is
against
a
federal
statute
enacted
for
the
purpose
of
protecting
safety
on
the
highways
to
sell
liquor
to
any
uniformed
driver
of
a
truck
or
a
bus.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
take
it
one
step
further.
what
about
airline
pilots
in
uniform?
the
federal
government
couldn't
even
prevent
sale
of
liquor
to
them?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
cohen,
as
i
understand
your
argument,
you
would
agree,
would
you
not,
that
they
could
not
attach
an
unconstitutional
condition
to
the
acceptance
of
the
grant?
for
example,
they
couldn't
say
you
may
have
the
money
provided
you
employ
nothing
but
republican
people,
republicans
to
build
the
road,
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
there
is
a
limit
to
the
expenditure
grant
based
on
whether
the
condition
would
be
otherwise
illegal,
i
suppose.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
if
this
condition
should
violate
the
twenty-first
amendment,
you
might
be
in
trouble.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
example,
if
the
condition
in
this
grant
were
to
a
state
that
had
prohibition,
they
say,
we
will
give
you
the
money
provided
you
repeal
your
prohibition
law,
i
think
you
would
probably
say
that
was
invalid.
justice
john
paul
stevens
for
two
reasons.
one,
it
wouldn't
make
much
sense.
and
secondly,
it
would
also
fly
right
in
the
teeth
of
the
wooden
reading
of
section
2
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
get
my
hypothetical?
i
mean,
the
condition
is
that
the
state
now
has
total
prohibition.
you
can
have
the
money
if
you
repeal
your
prohibition
laws,
if
you
increase
the
drinking
age,
something
like
that.
i
think
you
would
agree
that
that
would
be--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--your
argument
at
least
would
prohibit
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand.
i
did
that
deliberately.
but
i
am
suggesting
if
you
attach
a
condition
that
does
violate
the
twenty-first
amendment,
do
you
not
have
a
serious
issue
under
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--which
would
violate
it
if
it
were
a
direct
statute,
is
what
i
am
saying.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
not.
what
is
the
difference?
both
of
them
are
unconstitutional.
both
of
them
are
things
that
the
constitution
would
prohibit
the
federal
government
from
doing
directly.
can
they
do
those
things
indirectly
by
conditioning
the
grant
of
funds
on
compliance
with
what
would
otherwise
be
an
unconstitutional
requirement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
are
switching
to
the
tenth
amendment.
you
are
switching
my...
my
argument
is,
my
hypothesis
is
the
requirement
that
is
imposed
in
order
to
accept
the
money
is
that
you
do
something
which
the
federal
government
could
not
directly
require
you
to
do,
such
as
limit
the
distribution
to
people
of
one
political
party,
or
two,
to
require
the
enactment
of
a
statute
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
prohibits
the
federal
government
from
requiring
to
be
enacted.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
have
suggested
that
in
cases
where
the
court
has
said
there
is
no
hierarchy
of
constitutional
values.
we
are
on
a
slippery
slope
when
we
start
drawing
distinctions
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
can
you
say
that
allowing
drinking
up
to
the
age
of
21
is
stricter
than
allowing
it
up
to
the
age...
i
mean
up
to
the
age
of
19
is
stricter
than
allowing
it
up
to
21?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
you
are
enforcing
stricter
laws,
but
as
i
understand
it
you
are
trying
to
defend
a
law
that
is
less
strict.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
allows
drinking
by
people
under
21.
that
is
less
strict
than--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--what
do
you
make
out
of
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
still
less
strict
to
allow
you
to
drink
3.2
beer
at
age
20
than
to
allow
you
to
drink
no
alcohol
at
age
20.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
give
you
one
other
hypothetical
i
have
been
thinking
about
in
view
of
your
reliance
on
the
states'
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment?
supposing
as
a
condition
of
a
grant
to
build
interstate
limited
access
highways
they
require
you
to
set
up
so
many
gas
stations
at
intervals
where
the
people
can
stop
without
getting
off
the
highway,
and
they
further
provide
that
no
liquor
may
be
sold
in
any
of
those.
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
was
an...
exceeded
congress's
power.
