mr.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
or
not
congress
may
condition
the
receipt
of
highway
funds
upon
a
state
having
in
effect
the
21-year-old
drinking
age.
in
1984
congress
enacted
23
usc
section
158.
section
158
of
that
act
conditions
a
receipt
of
highway
funds
upon
a
state
having
in
effect
a
21-year-old
drinking
age
for
all
alcoholic
beverages.
the
act
prohibits
or
mandates
that
the
secretary
of
transportation
shall
not
distribute
5
percent
of
a
state's
highway
funds
if
it
is
not
in
compliance
for
fiscal
year
1987,
and
it
further
mandates
that
the
secretary
will
withhold
10
percent
of
those
funds
for
each
and
every
year
thereafter
that
the
state
has
failed
to
comply.
south
dakota,
like
every
other
state
in
the
nation,
is
a
recipient
of
federal
highway
funds
under
the
programs
referred
to
in
section
158.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
what
i
would
point
out
to
the
court
is
that
in
the
last
legislative
session,
recognizing
that
south
dakota,
not
unlike
any
other
state
in
the
union,
is
dependent
upon
these
funds,
adopted
a
21-year-old
drinking
age
that
will
not
go
into
effect
until
april
1st
of
1988.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that's
correct.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
yes.
right
now
south
dakota
still
permits
19
and
20-year-olds
to
consume
low
point
beer.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that's
correct.
the
legislature
in
enacting
the
law
that
it
passed
this
legislative
session
specifically
provided
within
the
statute
itself
that
the
legislation
would
repeal
itself
upon
either
a
favorable
decision
from
this
court
or
upon
congressional
action
repealing
the
mandatory
withholding
provisions
of
section
158.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that's
correct.
for
the
past
48
years
south
dakota
has
allowed
persons
younger
than
age
21
to
consume
low
point
beer,
ever
since
south
dakota
has
adopted
an
approach
that
not
only
recognizes
the
social
concerns
over
alcohol
but
has
gradually
introduced
its
young
people
to
alcoholic
beverages.
twice
since
1939
we
have
raised
our
minimum
drinking
age
for
low
point
beer
from
18
to
19,
and
since
the
repeal
of
state
prohibition
in
1934
we
have
required
all
persons
to
be
at
least
21
years
old
before
they
would
be
allowed
to
consume
alcoholic
beverages
other
than
low
point
beer.
south
dakota
has
likewise
enacted
and
strictly
enforced
drinking
driver
statutes,
and
over
the
course
of
the
last
few
years
through
the
strict
enforcement
of
those
statutes
we
have
effectuated
a
30
percent
reduction
in
the
number
of
drinking-related
fatalities
on
our
highways.
in
september
of
1984
we
filed
a
complaint
in
district
court,
seeking
a
declaration
that
section
158
was
unconstitutional
and
further
requesting
an
injunction
prohibiting
the
secretary
of
transportation
from
enforcing
the
provisions
of
that
statute.
the
district
court
dismissed
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
on
the
basis
that
south
dakota's
complaint
failed
to
state
a
claim
upon
which
relief
can
be
granted.
just
by
procedural...
or
just
by
a
little
bit
of
history,
as
this
court
is
aware,
in
1933
this
nation
adopted
the
twenty-first
amendment,
thereby
repealing
16
years
of
national
prohibition
and
reserving
to
the
states
the
power
of
choice
as
to
whether
or
not
to
allow
the
importation
of
alcoholic
beverages
within
their
own
states.
this
court
has
also
recognized
that
a
state
has
the
absolute
power
to
prohibit
totally
the
sale
of
alcohol
within
its
own
borders
pursuant
to
the
twenty-first
amendment,
and
this
court
has
equally
recognized
that
a
state
has
broad
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
regulate
the
times,
places,
and
circumstances
under
which
alcohol
may
be
sold.
as
this
court
stated
in
new
york
state
liquor
authority
versus
balianca,
"it
is
equally
well
recognized
that
a
state
has
broad
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
regulate
the
times,
places,
and
circumstances
under
which
liquor
may
be
sold.
"
put
another
way,
this
court
stated
in
california
liquor
dealers
v.
midcal
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
grants
the
states
virtually
complete
control
over
whether
to
permit
importation
or
sale
of
liquor
and
how
to
structure
the
liquor
distribution
system.
in
resolving
conflicts
between
state
alcohol
regulations
and
federal
policies,
the
court
has
first
sought
to
determine
whether
the
state
regulation
that
was
involved
implicates
what
this
court
has
generally
characterized
as
a
section
2
core
power.
the
court
has
suggested
that
when
a
state
has
attempted
to
directly
regulate
a
section
2
core
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
that
it
will
prevail
irrespective
of
its
conflict
with
a
contrary
federal
policy.
the
state
would
submit
to
the
court,
recognizing
that
this
court
has
never
formally
offered
a
clear
delineation
of
what
constitutes
a
section
2
core
power,
that
the
ability
of
a
state
to
determine
for
its
own
inhabitants
or
for
its
own...
the
people
found
within
its
borders,
the
age
at
which
a
person
will
be
allowed
to
consume
an
alcoholic
beverage
is
central
to
the
power
reserved
to
the
states
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
this
court,
as
i
indicated
earlier,
recognized
that
a
state
has
the
absolute
power
of
prohibition--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
however,
the
constitutionally
impermissible
part
of
congress's
plan
is
that
it
forces
south
dakota
to
make
a
choice
of
whether
or
not
it
will
freely
exercise
the
powers
given
to
it
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
or
whether
it
will
suffer--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--thank
you,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
in
direct
response
to
justice
blackmun's
question
concerning
the
ability
of
the
states
to
still
have
a
choice
even
in
the
face
of
section
158,
i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
that
is
erroneous
or
that
assumption
is
in
error
for
two
reasons.
one,
it
presupposes
that
the
federal
government
has
the
ability
to
regulate
in
the
face
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
the
age
at
which
a
state
such
as
south
dakota
sets
its
minimum
drinking
age,
and
secondly,
it
is
in
direct
contradiction
to
the
legislative
history
that
surrounds
the
original
amendment
in
its
debate
over
what
was
then
contained
as
a
section
3
to
the
amendment,
which
would
have
given
congress
concurrent
power
to
regulate
or
prohibit
the
sale
of
intoxicating
liquors
where
those
liquors
were
to
be
drunk
on
the
premises
sold.
at
that
time,
unlike
the
inconsistencies
that
were
present
in
the
debate
over
section
2,
there
was
no
inconsistency
in
that
regard.
it
was
the
intent
of
congress
by
deletion
of
section
3
to
remove
the
federal
government
from
the
area
of
alcohol
regulation
within
a
state
from
which
it
had
in
the
opinion
of
congress
and
in
the
opinion
of
this
court
had
trespassed.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
yes,
i
do,
your
honor,
and
i
rely
on
this
court's
decisions
in
addressing
the
twenty-first
amendment
when
this
court
has
said
that
the
twenty-first
amendment,
while
it
is
transparently
clear
that
it
operated
as
a
limitation
upon
the
commerce
clause,
it
equally
recognized
that
the
twenty-first
amendment
gave
to
the
states
broad
powers
to
regulate
in
the
area
of
the
times
or
places
or
even
the
sale
of
liquor,
in
other
words,
the
liquor
distribution
system
within
that
state.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
well,
i
would
certainly
maintain
that,
your
honor.
i
recognize,
however,
this
court's
decisions
in
regards
to
the
commerce
clause
in
the
face
of
the
tenth
amendment,
and
that
the
tenth
amendment
does
not
in
and
of
itself
operate
as
a
limitation
on
congress's
power.
i
think
the
distinction
here
is
that
in
the
face
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
congress
intended
and
the
states
upon
ratification
of
the
amendment
assumed
that
they
were
going
to
be
given
the
power
to
first
off
determine
whether
they
would
permit
the
sale
of
alcohol
at
all,
and
if
they
chose
to,
to
enforce
the
regulations
surrounding
the
sale
of
that
alcohol.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that's
correct,
and
i
am
suggesting...
what
i
am
suggesting
to
the
court
is
that
the
presentation
of
the
choice
irrespective
of
the
amount
of
money
involved
is
what...
is
the
impermissible
derogation
of
the
state's
powers
under
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
we
are
certainly
not
unmindful
of
those
cases,
and
for
the
court
to
rule
in
the
state's
favor
on
this
case
would
not
require
this
court
to
overrule
any
of
those
prior
cases
concerning
limitations
or
claimed
limitations
on
congress's
power
under
the
spending
clause.
in
the
steward
machine
case,
for
instance--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--i
would
say,
your
honor,
that
if
the
court
were
to
find
that
the
operation
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
only
prevented
congress
from
interfering
with
a
state's
right
to
allow
into
the
state
the
importation
of
alcohol,
that
certainly
would
put
us
in
a
more
difficult
position,
but
that
is
not
what
this
court
has
recognized
in,
for
instance,
capital
cities
cable
versus
crisp.
the
court
in
that
case,
if
i
may
just
briefly
recite
from
that
opinion,
the
court
stated,
"in
contrast
to
state
regulation
governing
the
conditions
under
which
liquor
may
be
imported
or
sold
within
the
state,
the
application
of
oklahoma's
advertising
ban
to
the
importation
to
distant
signals
by
cable
television
operators
engages
only
indirectly
the
central
power
reserved
by
the
twenty-first
amendment,
that
of
exercising
control
over
whether
to
permit
importation
or
sale
of
liquor
and
how
to
structure
the
liquor
distribution
system.
"
following
that
line
of
reasoning
that
this
court
has
adopted
not
only
in
capital
cities
cable
v.
crisp
but
in
midcal
and
again
referred
to
in
this
court's
most
recent
decision
dealing
with
the
twenty-first
amendment,
324
liquor
versus
duffy.
the
states
are
given
this
broad
power
in
areas
not
only
related
exclusively
to
the
decision
of
whether
or
not
to
permit
importation
but
they
are
given
the
power
to
regulate
the
very
liquor
that
it
allows
under
its
ability
to
allow
importation.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
your
honor,
what
i
would
also--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--well,
in
effect
it
does,
your
honor.
i
guess
i
would
argue
that
point
in
that
the
distribution
system
of
alcohol
is
certainly
directly
related
to
or
is
one
and
the
same
of
determining
how
it
can
be
sold
or
distributed
within
the
state,
and
the
setting
of
a
minimum
drinking
age
is
basic
to
that
consideration.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
yes,
i
would
argue
that,
and
in
part
our
reliance,
your
honor,
is
based
upon
this
court's
decision
in
new
york
state
liquor
authority
versus
balianca,
where
the
court
stated,
"it
is
equally
well
recognized
that
a
state
has
broad
power
under
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
regulate
the
times,
places,
and
circumstances
under
which
liquor
may
be
sold.
"
the
congressional--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--no,
i
don't
believe
they
could,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
the
question
correctly.
could
the
federal
government
require
us
not
to
sell
to
a
specific
group
of
people?
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
would
say
that,
no,
it
could
not.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
would
suggest
that
that
is
the
case.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
yes,
sir.
going
back
to
the
congressional
intent
behind
the
adoption
of
the
twenty-first
amendment,
it
was
well
recognized
in
1933
as
well
as
now
the
national
prohibition,
the
national
policy
of--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--i
think
this
court's
holdings,
for
instance,
in
the
collins
v.
yosemite...
yosemite...
excuse
me...
case
would
suggest
just
that,
and
i
don't
have
a
problem
with
that.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
yes,
i
would
maintain
that.
and
the
point,
the
distinguishing
factor,
your
honor,
between
the
example
that
you
cite
and
the
premise
that
we
are
advocating
is
that
in
the
context
of
a
military
reservation
the
state
cannot
impose
its
will
upon
an
area
that
is
not
under
its
jurisdiction.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
would
concede
that.
i
would
concede
that,
and
that
brings
us
to
the
point,
the
question
has
often
been
stated
in
another
way.
could
congress
just
refuse
to
just
give
this
money
to
the
states
in
the
first
instance,
and
that
is...
the
answer
to
that
must
be
yes.
we
have
no
actual
entitlement
to
money
in
the
first
instance.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
well,
okay.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
are
we
assuming
that
congress
is
going
to
condition
the
receipt
of
money
on--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--i
would
submit
that
it
would
be
unlawful.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
yes,
because
again,
your
honor,
it
goes
to
the
every
heart
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
yes,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
no,
i
don't
believe
so,
because
our
case
that
we
are
arguing
is
much
more
narrowly
defined.
you
know,
as
this
court
has
noted
in
many
of
its
opinions
there
will
be
time
enough
to
address
those
types
of
questions.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
blanket
provision
requiring
the
states
to
adopt
a
uniform
drinking
age
in
the
face
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
takes
away
from
the
state
the
ability
to
make
those
decisions
for
itself.
and
that
was
what
congress
and
this
nation
was
addressing
when
it
adopted...
or
repealed
prohibition.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
would
have
to
steadfastly
maintain
that
they
could
not,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
am
not
going
to
go
so
far
as
to
say
that,
your
honor.
i
think
that
it
could
be
suggested
that
congress
under
its
commerce
clause
powers
could
impose
a
regulation
upon
the
states
which
it
otherwise
could
not
do
in
the
face
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
am
arguing--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--no,
i
don't.
i
suggest
in
our
brief
that
the
conditions
are
invalid
outside
the
context
of
the
twenty-first
amendment
from
the
standpoint
that
they
are
coercive.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
your
honor,
i
am
not
in
a
position
to
suggest
to
this
court
that
i
disagree
with
that
proposition.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
address
that
issue
in
light
of
the
fact
that
we
have
the
twenty-first
amendment.
i
think
it
would
be--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--it
is
from
the
standpoint
that
congress's
power
under
the
commerce
clause
is
not
without
limitations,
as
this
court
has
noted,
for
instance,
in
lawrence
county
v.
lead-deadwood
school
district.
and
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
the
tenth
amendment
would
operate
as
a
bar
upon
congress
to
impose
these
types
of
conditions
which
in
effect
are
coercive
upon
the
states,
and
that
are
being
used...
is
being
attached
for
a
purpose
not
related
to--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--the
argument
that
is
made
in
the
amicus
brief
is
one
that
the
purpose
for
which
the
condition
is
attached
is
not
proper,
and
i
guess
i
would
just
have
to
maintain
that
i
am
not
prepared
to
argue
that
particular
fine
point
at
this
time
because
we
are
not
dealing
outside
the
scope
of
the
twenty-first
amendment.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
think
that
would
certainly
be
in
keeping
with
this
court's
prior
decisions.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
it
may
not
be
a
position
that
i
like
to
advocate,
but
it
is
certainly
one
that
i
recognize.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
well,
i
guess
i
can
sum
it
up,
your
honor,
by
just
suggesting
that
if
we
lose
on
the
twenty-first
amendment
i
recognize
we
are
in
trouble
on
the
tenth
amendment.
your
honor,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time,
if
i
might,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
would
like
to
take
up
where
mr.
cohen
has
just
left
off,
and
that
is
the
federal
interest
that
has
been
in
essence
the
cornerstone
of
this
regulation
or
this
condition
that
the
congress
has
imposed
under
section
158.
the
problem
with
standing
up
and
suggesting
that
this
is
an
inherently
federal
interest
ignores
the
very
basic
realities
that
each
and
every
state
is
just
as
concerned
about
its
kids
as
the
federal
government,
but
we
in
south
dakota
have
chose
a
different
way
of
addressing
and
preserving
and
attempting
to
reduce
the
incident
of
teenage
alcohol
and
driving-related
fatalities,
and
that
is
through
the
enforcement
of
stricter
drinking
and
driving
laws,
additionally
through
education.
there
is
a
wide
variety--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that
is
true.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
that
is
absolutely
true.
two
things
i
would
like
to
point
out
very
quickly,
and
that
is,
in
south
dakota,
with
our
19-year-old
age
at
which
people
can
consume
3.2
beer,
these
establishments,
the
3.2
beer
licensed
establishments
are
separate
and
distinct
from
a
regular
alcohol
establishment.
the
other
thing
is,
though,
it
underscores--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--well,
i
just...
i
wanted
to
throw
that
out
more
for
informational
purposes
than
for...
i
just
want
to
suggest
that
we
recognize
the
special
place--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--that's
correct,
and
the
point
i
was
going
to
make
is
that
that
underscores,
however,
south
dakota's
attempt,
or
a
recognition
of
not
only
a
problem
but
making
a
sincere
attempt
at
addressing
that
problem
in
a
way
that
is
different
from
the
other
states.
we
are
suggesting
that
the
gradual
introduction
of
alcohol
in
a
person's
life
is
better
than
when
they
reach
21
just
shoving
them
through
the
door.
and
that
is
the
philosophy
that
is
underscored
by
the--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--oh,
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
i
would
say
that
the
incidence--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--well,
that
is
one
analysis
that
could
be
made,
and
in
fact
that
is
the
analysis
that--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--well,
i
just
want
to
clarify,
your
honor,
that
there
are
parts
of
that
assumption
that
don't
necessarily
follow,
and
there
are
other
parts
of
it
that
are
left
outside
of
the
consideration.
first
off--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--your
honor,
given
my
experience
as
a
state's
attorney,
i
can
assure
you
that
there
will
probably
be
more
than
ten.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
yes,
but
what
i
would
like
to
point
out,
your
honor,
is
that
if
we
impose
a
21
drinking
age
in
south
dakota,
we
could
equally
find
that
we
are
driving
18,
19,
and
20-year-olds
out
into
the
countryside
to
consume
alcoholic
beverages,
not
only
restricted
to
3.2
beer,
and
that
in
and
of
itself
puts
them
behind
the
wheel
of
a
car.
the
very
problem
that
congress
was
trying
to
circumvent
or
remove--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
no,
no.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
not
what
the
drinking
age
should
be.
the
issue
is
who
should
be
able
to
determine
for
each
individual
state
what
that
drinking
age
should
be,
and
again
i
would
just
submit
that
this
court's--
mr.
roger
a.
tellinghuisen
--yes,
sir.
i
would.
i
just
would
like
to
conclude
by
saying
that
the
history
behind
the
twenty-first
amendment
in
some
respects,
as
this
court
has
acknowledged
in
its
prior
holdings,
is
at
best
inconsistent,
but
there
is
one
consistency
that
prevails
throughout,
and
that
is
that
it
was
congress's
intent
upon
adopting
the
resolution
which
ultimately
became
the
twenty-first
amendment
to
remove
congress
from
the
local
regulation
of
what
was
considered
to
be
a
local
problem,
and
that
is
alcohol.
thank
you
very
much.
