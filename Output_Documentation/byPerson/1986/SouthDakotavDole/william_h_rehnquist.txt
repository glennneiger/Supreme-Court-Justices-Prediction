chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
south
dakota
against
elizabeth
h.
dole,
secretary,
united
states
department
of
transportation.
mr.
tellinghuisen,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
can
finish
your
answer
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
tellinghuisen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
please
proceed,
mr.
tellinghuisen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
tellinghuisen,
you
think
the
twenty-first
amendment
went
further
than
just
to
deal
with
the
commerce
power
of
congress
then?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
don't
you
think
they
would
have
had
that
just
under
traditional
reserve
power
of
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
here
you
say
that
because
congress
is
cutting
off
5
percent
of
south
dakota's
highway
fund
money,
south
dakota
is
not
able
to
do
what
it
wants?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
a
lot
of
cases
that
have
sustained
the
congress's
spending
power,
steward
machine
company,
a
long
line
of
cases.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tellinghuisen.
we
will
hear
now
from
you
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
before
the
twenty-first
amendment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
you
take
the
converse
of
that
situation?
congress
decides
it
has
been
a
bad
year
for
the
distilleries
and
therefore
it
requires
that
any
state
accept
shipments
even
though
the
state
may
be
dry
by
choice.
it
says
it
is
the
policy
of
the
federal
government
to
require
freedom
of
movement
in
interstate
commerce
of
hard
liquor.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
when
you
speak
of
the
word
"germane",
how
is
that
being
used
as
a
term?
to
what
does
the
requirement
have
to
be
germane?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
mr.
tellinghuisen,
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
tellinghuisen.
the
case
is
submitted.
