mr.
jones,
the
record
shows,
i
take
it,
that
mr.
rose
had
$7,000
accumulated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
that
the
money
was
not
itself
part
of
the
disability
payments?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
that
money
subject
to
the
same
legal
restrictions
that
the
disability
payments,
monthly
disability
payments
are
under?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
whatever
money
was
available
to
him
over
and
above
the
monthly
payments,
you
assert,
came
through
the
veterans
administration
and
is
subject
to
whatever
the
legal
requirements
are?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
if
this
were
a
similar
provision
in
a
spendthrift
trust
in
the
private
sector
rather
than
in
a
statute,
i
suppose
there
is
considerable
authority
that
the
state's
position
is
correct,
that
support
payments
can
be
ordered
and
can
be
enforced
by
contempt
proceedings
and
are
not
subject
to
the
spendthrift
trust
provisions.
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
jones,
do
you
really
think
that
some
remote,
distant
federal
institution
like
the
veterans
administration
is
in
a
better
position
as
a
practical
matter
to
consider
the
details
and
equities
of
all
these
thousands
of
cases
and
to
consider
the
real
needs
of
the
children
and
the
disabled
veteran,
than
state
courts
where
these
matters
are
traditionally
handled?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
clegg,
isn't
there
really
a
line
of
common
law
precedents
and
cases
that
distinguish
familial
obligations
from
commercial
obligations,
and
in
similar
contexts,
in
spendthrift
trust
provisions
written
just
like
this
statute,
haven't
courts
enforced
those
familial
obligations?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
other
assets
that
mr.
rose
might
have
had?
do
you
take
the
position
that
whatever
aid
he
received
to
acquire
housing
is
governed
by
precisely
the
same
statutory
language?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so,
where
would
someone
in
tennessee
have
to
go?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
va
ever
pay
more
than
$90
a
month?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
rut
that's
not...
why
do
we
have
the
$90
figure
here?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sherrod.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
apparently
mrs.
rose
never
made
application
to
the
va
for
an
apportionment
or
child
care--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--but
you
don't
take
the
position,
do
you,
that
mrs.
rose
was
somehow
precluded
by
state
law
or
otherwise
from
applying
at
the
va
for
an
apportionment?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
it
would
hardly
be
futile
if
she
could
get
money.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
she
just
chose
not
to
do
it?
