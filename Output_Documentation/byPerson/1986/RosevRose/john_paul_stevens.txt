justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
contend...
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
the
property
accumulated
from
the
pension
payments
could
have
been
used
or
could
not
have
been
used
to
satisfy
an
obligation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
supposing
instead
of
$800
a
month,
he
had
a
cadillac
or
something
he
bought
with
veterans
payments
and
the
order
had
said,
don't
pay
$800
a
month,
sell
the
cadillac
and
give
the
proceeds
of
sale
to
your
dependents.
would
that
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
follow
up
on
justice
white's
question.
does
it
mean
that
in
the...
say
a
creditor
case,
say
the
creditor
got
a
judgment
for
$1,000.
would
you
say
the
tennessee
court
couldn't
even
enter
the
judgment?
maybe
it
wouldn't
be
collectable,
but
could
they
defend
the
suit
if,
say,
he
bought
some
new
clothes
or
a
car
or
something
and
ran
up
a
bill
of
a
couple
thousand
dollars
at
a
store
and
the
store
then
sued
him
for
the
$2,000
and
he
defended
on
the
ground,
"the
only
money
i
have
i
received
from
the
veterans
administration,
ergo,
don't
enter
a
judgment
against
me.
"
could
he
do
that?
well,
they
could
get
the
judgment,
i
guess,
but--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--all
right.
so
that,
is
it,
just
by
analogy
then,
is
the
order
requiring
the
payment
of
$800
a
month
different
from
the
judgment?
maybe
the...
or
say,
"go
to
jail
or
pay
it.
"
maybe.
is
the
order
of
the
tennessee
court
itself
requiring
the
payment
contrary
to
the
federal
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
take
it,
though,
mr.
sherrod,
it's
your
position
that
if
she
had
gone,
maybe
after
a
delay
and
gotten,
say
three
or
four
hundred
dollars
a
month
from
the
direct
payment
out
of
the
veterans
administration,
you
could
then
have
gone
back
to
the
tennessee
court
and
said,
"this
isn't
enough,
we
need
an
additional
allotment?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
you
could
have
had
both,
i
suppose,
at
least
theoretically,
under
your
view
of
the
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
would
rather
get
your
money
in
that
form
and
then
pay
the
overage
back
than
have
to
fight
for
it
every
month--
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
cody,
your
argument
raised
a
question
in
my
mind
about
these
27,000
cases
over
at
the
veterans
administration.
you
suggest
that
many
of
them
may
be
voluntary
arrangements
where
there
is
not
necessarily
a
divorce
situation
but
where
there
is
a
reason
why
they
would
not
want
to
pay
the
money
directly
to
the
veteran
but
might
to
a
dependent.
i
just
notice
the
statute
authorizes
payment
to,
on
behalf
of
the
veteran,
spouse,
children
or
dependent
parents.
but
this
case
doesn't
involve
a
spouse.
it's
an
ex-spouse.
do
you
agree
that
they
actually
make
these
payments
to
former
spouses
as
well
as
spouses?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question?
is
it
your
view
that,
supposing
there
is
enough
money,
say
the
man
had
enough
money
to
pay
$700
or
$800
a
month
of
support
money,
but
the
court
fixed
that
amount
largely
on
the
basis
of
the
availability
of
the...
that
would
not
violate
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
fine.
and
you
do
say
that
the
word
3107?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
regulations--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
it
would
be
support
money
rather
than
alimony?
it
would
no
authorize
the
payment
of
the
equivalent
alimony,
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
see,
an
estranged
spouse
would
be
a
spouse
but
a
divorced
spouse
is
not
a
spouse.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
the
thing,
your
27,000
person
figure
is
a
very
persuasive
figure,
but
maybe
they
are
all
cases
in
which
the
veteran
was
perfectly
happy
to
have
all
or
any
part
of
the
compensation
paid
to
the
family
because
he
was
unable
to
write
checks
or
something
like
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
we
don't
know
how
many
of
those
are
broken
families?
