mr.
jones,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
jones.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
clegg.
mr.
clegg,
somewhere
in
your
argument
you
will
tell
me
how
this
order
affects
the
payment
of
this
disability
monthly
check,
if
it
is
monthly,
in
any
way.
it
still
goes
direct
to
the
veteran,
as
i
understand
it.
you
carry
on
and
relate
it
to
me.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you,
mr.
clegg,
and
i
think
it
has
been
gone
into
before
but
i
want
to
make
certain
i
understand.
what
actually
happened
here
is
that
the
state
court
entered
an
order
requiring
that
mr.
rose
pay
$800
a
month
for
child
support?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
there
any
effort
to
garnish?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
or
attach?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
you
answer
whether
or
not
there
was
any
effort?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
the
contempt
proceedings
where
the
court
tells
him
to
go
to
jail...
it
is
ordinarily
separate
from
the
order
requiring
him
to
pay,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
was
it
separate
here?
i
mean,
was
an
order
first
entered
requiring
him
to
pay
$800
a
month
and
then
when
he
was
unable
to
comply
he
was
held
in
contempt?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
whether
you're
willing
to
do
so
or
not,
surely
you
could
confine
your
attack
to
the
order
committing
him
for
contempt,
saying
that
the
state
court
order,
800>
["],
isn't
indicating
where
that
money
should
come
from.
it's
only
when
the
state
judge
knows
that
he
is
going
to
have
to
pay
these
veterans
administration
benefits
and
still
insists
on
sending
him
to
jail
if
he
doesn't,
that's
your
legal
or
equitable
process,
not
the
entry
of
the
order.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
clegg.
we
will
hear
next
from
you,
mr.
sherrod.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
nothing
under
tennessee
law
would
have
prevented
her
from
going
to
the
va
in
addition
to
getting
her
divorce
and
getting
custody
of
the
children,
would
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
she
might
have
been
unsuccessful
or
less
successful,
but
she
didn't
even
try
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--but
how
about
getting
away
from
the
apportionment
statute
and
getting
back
to
the
attachment,
garnishment
statute,
don't
you...
because
it's
a
pretty
strong
argument
that
an
order
committing
mr.
rose
for
contempt
for
failure
to
pay
the
child
support
payments
would
come
under
the
definition
of
attachment,
levy
or
seizure
by
any
legal
or
equitable
process
whatever?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
how
about
the
language
at
the
very
end
of
38
u.s.c.
3101
where
it
says,
"either
before
or
after
receipt
by
the
beneficiary?
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
language
i
just
read
said
that
you
can't
have
equitable
process
or
attachment
or
garnishment,
anything
like
that,
either
before
or
after
receipt
by
the
beneficiary.
so,
it
seems
to
me
it's
designed
to
do
more
than
just
not
interfere
with
the
flow
of
money
from
the
va
to
the
veteran.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
the
tennessee
court
of
appeals
had
said
he
could
have
made
these
payments
without
invading
veterans'
benefits
we
might
have
a
different
case.
but
that
isn't
what
they
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
was
thinking
the
contempt
citation
was
analogous,
or
at
least
might
be
governed
by
the
language,
"attachment,
levy
or
seizure
by
any
legal
or
equitable
process
whatever.
"
if
you
are
told,
you
know,
either
you
pay
this
money
out
of
the
$800
or
you
go
to
jail,
that
certainly
comes
pretty
close
to
any
kind
of
legal
or
equitable
process.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sherrod.
general
cody,
we
will
hear
from
you
at
this
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
cody.
mr.
clegg,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clegg.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
