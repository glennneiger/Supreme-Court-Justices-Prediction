mr.
jones,
your
basic
argument
is
that
congress
wanted
this
money
to
be
for
the
exclusive
use
of
the
veteran
and
not
to
be
allocable
to
his
dependents?
justice
antonin
scalia
how
has
the
administrator
used
his
authority
under
section
3107?
does
he
do
it
on
a
case-by-case
basis
or
is
it
just
this
$90
minimum
that
you
are
talking
about?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
supposedly,
if
this
statute
prevents
what
was
attempted
to
be
done
here
on
the
basis
of
the
"attachment,
levy,
garnishment"
language
it
would
also
prevent
this
veteran
from
being
incarcerated
for
child
support,
for
failure
to
support
his
children
when
his
wife
is
still
alive.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
state
could
not
proceed
against
him
at
all
for
failure
to
support
his
children
and
his
obligation
would
be
dependent
entirely
upon
whatever
the
va
thought
was
appropriate?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
feel
is
the
purpose
of
the
provision
that
allows
the
administrator
to
apportion?
what
is
it
there
for?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clegg,
i
hate
to
impose
on
your
one
minute,
but
really
what
do
you
do
about
the
situation
where
a
veteran
who
is
receiving
benefits,
his
wife
hasn't
left
him,
his
children
are
still
living
with
him,
and
the
state
wants
to
move
against
him
for
failure
to
support
his
children?
what
can
they
do?
can
the
state
do
anything?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
they
couldn't
put
him
in
jail
or
couldn't
punish
him
at
all
because
so
long
as
that's
all
that
he's
getting,
you
are
saying
they
can't
punish
him
for
failure
to
support
his
children,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
pretty
extreme,
isn't
it?
