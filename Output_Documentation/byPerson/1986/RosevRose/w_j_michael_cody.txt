mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
the
position
of
the
state
of
tennessee
that
congress
has
not
pre-empted
in
this
case
the
traditional
function
of
the
states
in
determining
child
support.
the
tennessee
statute
is
constitutional
on
its
face
and
is
applied
here
in
that
there
is
no
expressed
conflict
with
federal
law
and
no
major
damage
to
clear
and
substantial
federal
interest
in
this
case.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
justice,
it
is
our
view
that
3107,
which
is
the
apportionment
statute,
is
an
administrative
aid
in
child
support
enforcement.
it
is
an
alternative
and
a
parallel
proceeding
which
is
compatible
with
state
court
enforcement.
it
is
a
method
that
allows
the
government
to
make
direct
payments
to
the
children,
something
that
of
course
the
state
court
cannot
do.
it
is
available
in
addition
to
or
when
state
court
remedies
are
unavailable
or
inapplicable.
when
this
statute
was
originally
passed
in
1924
it
primarily
was
concerned
with
incompetence,
and
it
still
applies
in
that
situation.
there
might
be
a
case
where
there
was
a
separation
but
not
a
divorce,
where
the
husband
is
in
another
state
or
where
they
might
not
even
know
where
the
husband
is.
it
is
a
way
that
the
government
can
assist
in
a
direct
payment.
we
think
the
statute
is
clear
that
it
is
not
exclusive.
the
language...
the
word
"may"
is
used
twice
in
the
statute.
the
state
court
in
its
order
is
not
making
an
apportionment.
it's
not
doing
anything
akin
to
3107.
it's
not
executing
on
a
federal
interest.
and
there's
no
division
of
that
interest.
the
state
believes
that
this
court,
as
well
as
congress,
has
recognized
that
domestic
relations
including
the
protection
of
children
and
the
support
of
children
belongs
to
the
laws
of
the
state,
and
the
state
courts
provide
forums
and
have
historical
expertise
and
the
ability
to
give
a
comprehensive
review
to
support,
custody
and
visitation,
all
of
those
things
that
are
involved.
so,
there
has
developed
an
area,
i
believe,
in
the
law
which
requires
a
presumption
against
pre...
emption
in
the
field
of
domestic
relations.
congress
must
positively
require
by
direct
enactment,
before
this
pre-emption
will
be
presumed.
the
consequences
of
the
conflict,
if
they
could
be
found
in
one
of
these
three
statutes
which
we
submit
are
not
there,
those
conflicts
would
have
to
sufficiently
injure
a
federal
program
so
as
to
require
a
non-recognition.
we
believe
that
here
there
is
no
major
damage
to
any
clear
and
substantial
federal
interest.
the
purpose
here,
as
indicated
earlier,
is
that
if
a
veteran
is
disabled
that
he
and
his
dependents
will
have
a
source
of
income
to
replace
these
lost
earnings.
i
think,
as
justice
o'connor
indicated,
there
is
a
body
of
law
from
this
court
beginning
with
the
westmore
decision
in
1904,
that
says
that
children
are
not
creditors
and
child
support
is
not
a
debt;
that
this
exemption
in
3101
is
for
the
veteran
and
his
family
and
not
for
the
veteran
against
his
family.
prior
judicial
considerations
in
this
area,
we
think
overwhelmingly
show
that
the
courts...
the
d.c.
circuit,
two
decisions
there,
and
nine
states
have
held
that
child
support
is
not
within
exemptions,
and
congress
has
re-enacted
this
statute
many
times
without
significant
change.
we
believe
that
there
was
a
desire
on
the
part
of
congress
to
protect
veterans
from
creditors
and
not
to
protect
veterans
from
state
courts;
that
if
congress
had
intended
the
3107,
the
apportionment
aspect,
to
be
a
sole
recourse
rather
than
an
ancillary
and
an
assisting
resource,
then
it
could
have
said
so
clearly.
we
submit
that
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
there
has
been
no
damage
to
any
substantial
federal
interest.
it
is
suggested
by
the
solicitor
that
the
interest
here
is
that
if
a
veteran
believes
that
his
disability
benefits
might
be
awarded
to
his
children
by
a
state
court
that
somehow
he
might
conceal
his
injury.
that
does
not
seem
to
be
a
strong
purpose
because
military
pay
is
already
subject
to
garnishment
itself,
and
we
believe
it
untenable
that
congress
would
have
intended
that
this
result
would
happen.
mr.
w.
j.
michael
cody
if
the
court
please,
mr.
justice,
i
think
that
one
of
the
difficulties
that
we
have
in
this
record
is
the
way
this
case
came
up,
there
is
very
little
information
as
to
how
the
va
procedure
does
work
because
the
apportionment
situation
did
not
occur.
when
the
solicitor
mentioned
in
that
regard
that
it
could
be
20
percent
as
a
minimum
given,
under
the
regulations
that
apparently
only
applies
to
a
hardship
situation
and
not
a
regular
apportionment.
it
is
difficult
for
me
to
answer
your
question
but
i
think
that
we
would
have
to
say
that
if
the
apportionment
statute
means
anything
at
all,
that
it
would
have
to
be
available
to
a
separated
or
a
former
spouse.
but
we
believe
it
is
an
ancillary
procedure
that,
in
line
with
the
1975,
1977
and
'84
child
enforcement
support
legislation,
that
congress
recognized
that
we've
got
an
emergency
in
this
country
in
supporting
children,
in
getting
assets
available
to
them,
and
this
is
just
a
way
that
the
federal
government
assists
in
what
is
primarily
a
state,
traditional
state
function.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
