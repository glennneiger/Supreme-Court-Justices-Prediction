mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
if
it
may
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
a
veterans
case
to
start
with.
it
is
a
case
that
arose
out
of
a
divorce
in
tennessee
where
there
was
a
hearing,
where
mr.
rose
was
represented
by
an
attorney
who
declined
to
put
on
proof
in
a
divorce
case,
that
the
court,
the
tennessee
court
was
the
only
forum
that
ms.
rose
had
to
approach
because
the
state
of
tennessee
as
the
exclusive
jurisdiction
of
dissolution
of
marriage.
custody
and
support
flow
from
that.
at
the
time
that
the
court
originally
heard
the
divorce,
mr.
rose
made
$43,000
tax-free.
the
court
is
obligated
under
tennessee
law
to
make
a
decision
as
to
the
relative
abilities
to
pay
by
the
parents
of
the
children
and
then
look
at
the
needs
of
the
children,
and
then
make
an
award.
they
did
this.
they
made
an
award
of
$800
a
month.
of
the
$800
a
month
there
was
a
source
of
income
for
mr.
rose
outside
his
veterans
benefits
in
the
amount
of
$474
today.
it
was
$465
at
the
time
the
award
was
made.
the
difference
would
have
to
be
made
up.
in
the
original
divorce
they
split
the
equity
in
the
house.
mr.
rose
got
$12,000.
i
would
respectfully
suggest
that
the
federal
statutes
do
not
protect
the
property...
the
payments,
once
items
have
been
purchased,
and
that
that
money
was
available
to
make
up
the
difference
between
his
income
that
was
not
veterans
benefits
and
the
$800
awarded
by
the
court.
the
time
for
the
contempt
was
approximately
five
or
six
months
later.
at
that
point
in
time
there
was
no
way...
i
said
there
is
no
way...
there
is
no
indication
that
the
$12,000
had
been
spent.
in
fact,
mr.
rose
files
an
affidavit
that
says,
"i
have
spent
some
of
the
money
and
the
rest
of
it
i
have
set
aside
for
this
litigation
as
opposed
to
paying
my
kids'
child
support.
"
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
that
is
correct,
and
there
is
a
reason.
there
are
two
parallel
systems.
it's
like
comparing
apples
and
oranges
or
rocks.
it
has
a
tennessee
statute
which
looks
at
custody
and
awards
support
for
children
based
upon
the
ability
of
the
parents
to
pay
and
the
needs
of
the
child.
that
adjudication
is
made
based
upon
any
evidence
which
is
brought
before
the
court,
which
mr.
rose
could
have
done.
the
veterans'
apportionment
is
there
specifically
for
those
cases
where
a
veteran
might
become
incompetent
or
the
state
remedy
might
otherwise
be
inadequate
and
you
couldn't,
for
example,
get
service
of
process
over
a
veteran.
then,
a
person
could
go
to--
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
--no,
it
would
just
have
been
a
futile
act.
there
would
be
no
reason
for
her
to
go
there
because
the
state
of
tennessee
had
the
jurisdiction
to
do
what
she
wanted
to
do,
that
is,
procure--
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
--well,
it's
two
parallel
systems.
she
had
a
choice.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
nothing
would
have
prevented
her
from
asking
for
an
apportionment.
the
va
does
not
take
the
same
factors
into
account,
though,
that
the
state
court
would.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
she
did
not
try,
and
she
would
have
had
to
go
to
nashville,
tennessee
and
they
do
not
have
any
published
means
by
which
one
could
effect
this
procurement.
for
example,
under
the
veterans'
rules
and
regulations,
she
would
have
made
her
application.
if
an
objection
was
made,
it
could
have
been
up
to
a
year
before
a
decision
would
have
been
made
and
during
that
period
of
time
she
would
have
received
no
allocation.
the
veterans
administration
takes
into
consideration
such
things
as
the
meritoriousness
of
the
custodial
spouse,
which
has
nothing
to
do
with
the
rights
of
the
children.
for
example,
they
could
have
found
that
this
was
an
unfit
person
to
get
an
allocation,
"therefore,
we're
not
going
to
give
it
regardless
of
the
needs
of
the
children.
"
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
all
you
get...
you're
not
getting
the
same
thing.
what
you
get
from
the
state
of
tennessee
is
an
order
of
support.
what
you
get
from
the
veterans
administration
is
an
allotment
check
that
comes
directly
from
the
government
to
be
applied
to
the
order
of
support.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
theoretically,
i
guess,
the
veterans
administration
could
say,
we're
going
to
give
an
allotment
check
of
$1,000.
well,
when
it
comes
mr.
rose
only
owes
$800,
so
$200
would
be
immediately
refundable.
i
find
it
hard
to
fathom
that
the
veterans
administration
would
give
an
allotment
check--
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
a
question
was
asked,
too,
about
what
are
veterans'
benefits,
and
they
are
actually
an
earnings
replacement
based
upon
average
impairment
in
earning
capacity.
and
so,
given
that,
the
other
cases
like
this,
hisquierdo
and
mccarty,
talk
about
money
going
to
a
beneficiary.
in
this
particular
case
the
beneficiary
is
not
the
veteran.
the
beneficiary
is
the
veteran
and
his
family,
and
his
family
includes
his
children,
divorced
or
not
divorced,
and
under
those
circumstances
hisquierdo
and
mccarty
would
be
readily
distinguishable
because
these
are
the
same
dollars
that
the
man
was
using
to
pay
for
his
children
for
the
ten
years
he
was
married.
that
money
was
sent
to
him
as
a
replacement
for
his
income.
he
made
the
choice
to
get
married
and
have
children.
he
has
the
income
to
support
them.
now
taking
the
worst
case,
what
if
his
wife
had
died
and
now
he's
got
his
children
without
a
custody
order,
he
just
has
custody.
and
he
takes
the
position,
well,
i
don't
have
to
buy
their
clothes
any
more.
i
don't
have
to
buy
their
food.
is
he
immune
from
any
kind
of
civil
or
criminal
prosecution
because
it's
veterans
benefits
and
nobody
can
get
them?
i
think
that
would
be
a
very
untenable
position
for
the
government
to
take,
and
it's
an
extreme
example.
the
purpose
of
the
state
jurisdiction
is
not
the
same
as
the
purpose
of
the
federal
regulations.
like
what
i
just
said,
the
federal
regulations
are
basically
in
addition
to
any
state
jurisdiction
that's
available.
there
is
no
major
damage
which
we
can
see
which
we
believe
to
be
the
test.
we
do
not
believe
the
test
is
exclusivity
of
the
va
apportionment
procedure
because
if
that's
true,
they
would
not
have
provided
for
apportionees
to
receive
parts
of
the
money.
i
mean,
if
it
says
they
may
consider
upon
proper
application
whether
or
not
to
make
an
apportionment--
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
--no,
mr.
chief
justice,
because
the
order
doesn't
interfere
with
the
flow
of
money
from
the
va
to
the
veteran.
it's
not...
and
were
the
government
to
make
the
statement
that
this
protection
of
anti-attachment
follows
what
is
purchased
by
the
funds,
i
believe
that
to
be
incorrect.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
are
you
talking
about
where
there
is
a
contempt
action
that,
you
are
going
to
jail
if
you
don't
pay
this
money?
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
well,
there
is
no
specific
intent.
the
veteran
still
has
the
ability
to,
in
this
particular
case
especially,
not
to
pay...
not
to
use
va
benefits.
at
the
time
the
order
of
contempt
was
made,
he
was
in
a
position
that
he
could
have
paid
outside
the
veterans'
benefits
and
still
made
his
payments.
so,
in
this
particular
case,
factually
it
wouldn't
apply.
theoretically
i
do
not
believe...
i
think
it
is
distinguishable.
it
is
not
a...
i
think
the
words
are
"specific
attachment"
which
would
include
a
garnishment
or
process
such
as
that.
and
i
think
what
it
is,
if
a
court
doesn't
have
the
jurisdiction
to
enforce
its
orders--
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
--the
only
cases
that
benefits
don't
seem
to
address
your
point,
if
it
is
that
there
is
a
federal
interest
that
they
are
trying
to
protect
and
there
is
no
federal
interest
in
this
case
that
is
trying
to
be
protected,
because
even
if
the
veterans'
benefits
were
supposed
to
be
used
entirely
for
that
$800
and
the
court
ordered
contempt,
the
benefits
in
this
case
are
not
those
benefits
that
are
specifically
protected
by
a
federal
statute.
so,
i
would
say
that
it
would
not
be
applicable,
not
that
it
couldn't
be
called
an
equivalent
process.
i
just
think
it
would
not
be
applicable.
the
case
that
comes
to
mind
is
robison
where
there
was
a
review
of
educational
benefits
and
the
veterans
administration...
in
that
particular
case
it's
"state
jurisdiction
is
not
judicial
review.
"
and
i'm
trying
to
liken
that
the
contempt
is
not
the
equivalent...
it's
not
trying
to
place
judicial
review
or
veterans
administration
use
or
the
allocation
of
specific
veterans
funds
to
a
use
which
they
were
not
supposed
to
be
applied.
i
think
none
of
those
apply
in
this
case.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
it
seems
to
me
like
we
would
be
prostituting
the
section
3101
which
is
not
there
to
protect
the
veteran...
it's
there
to
protect
the
veteran
and
his
family
from
creditors
but
it's
not
there
to
protect
the
veteran
from
his
family
and
that's
what
they're
using
it
for
in
this
case.
i
guess
that's
what
i
am
trying
to
say.
i
would
also
say
that
our
argument
would
be
the
same
if
the
veteran
were
injured
after
or...
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
his
disability
occurred
before
or
after
he
married
and
had
children.
we
feel
that
it's
a
choice
that
he
makes.
in
a
particular
case,
had
he
married
and
had
children,
you
know...
i
think
every
person
is
chargeable
with
the
fact
that
if
you
have
children
you're
going
to
have
a
duty
to
support
them
and
i
don't
think
you
can
have
children
and
then
ignore
the
duty
of...
regardless
of
when
the
disability
comes
along.
so,
when
you
make
that--
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
would
think
that
would
be
true.
mr.
howell
h.
sherrod,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
believe
that
would
be
the
result.
i
will
also
state
we
found
no
legislative
or
congressional
intent
that
pre-empts
state
law
in
this
area.
the
only
legislative
intent
that
we
found
was
to
see
that
a
veteran
is
protected,
and
a
veteran
is
protected
under
many
of
the
statutes
but
under
this
particular
statute
the
veteran
and
his
family
is
to
be
protected.
i'd
reiterate
that.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
would
defer
to
mr.
cody.
