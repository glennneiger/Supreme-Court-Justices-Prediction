mr.
jerry
s.
jones
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
veterans'
rights
case
is
here
on
appeal
from
the
court
of
appeals
of
the
state
of
tennessee,
the
supreme
court
of
that
great
state
having
denied
application
for
permission
to
appeal,
which
is
in
the
nature
of
a
writ
of
certiorari.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
the
scheme
which
the
states
have
devised
to
circumvent
federal
law
frustrates
a
federal
purpose
and
violates
the
expressed
intent
of
congress
when
it
enacted
the
veterans'
benefits
act.
there
are
three
federal
statutes
which
are
primarily
at
issue
in
this
case.
they
are
all
found
in
the
veterans'
benefits
act,
title
38
to
the
united
states
code.
they
are
211(a),
3101,
and
3107.
the
united
states
government
has
joined
in
this
case
as
amici
and
the
government
is
in
a
better
position
to
argue
the
federal
law
than
i,
so
with
the
court's
permission
i
will
touch
on
those
statutes
but
defer
the
in-depth
discussion
to
the
united
states
government.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
that's
correct,
justice
white.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
two
hundred
dollars
per
month?
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
it
was
$800
per
month,
your
honor.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
no,
your
honor.
that
is
where
we
contend
that
there
was
an
attempted...
or
where
the
state
did
circumvent
the
expressed
intent
of
congress.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
there
would
be
no
question.
we
would
not
be
here
if
that
were
the
case.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
the
court
did
not
state
that.
but
the
facts
show
that
$500
per
month
must
come
from
veterans
disability
benefits
or
from
property
which
was
accumulated
by
the
use
of
veterans
disability
benefits.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
if
it
had
been
a
substantial
amount
so
that
he
could
have
made
his
child
support
payments,
we
would
not
be
here.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
i
am
sorry.
i
didn't
understand
the
question.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
yes,
it
would
violate
the
intent.
i
don't
think
it
would
violate
the
statute
per
se.
but
the
statute
states
that
the
veterans
benefits
are
exempt
from
levy,
attachment
or
seizure
both
before
and
after
receipt
by
the
beneficiary.
now,
the
cases
which
deal
with
that
problem
outside
the
domestic
relations
area
indicates
that
the
funds
which
are
used
to
purchase
assets,
or
the
assets
that
are
purchased
from
these
funds
are
likewise
exempt
because
congress
stated
that
the
funds
were
exempt
both
before
and
after
receipt
by
the
beneficiary.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
the
record
does
not
show
that,
justice
o'connor.
the
state
will
argue
that
there
was
some
$12,000
from
the
sale
of
the
parties'
marital
residence.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
but
the
proof
would
show
that
that
money
came
from
the
veterans
administration
from
a
grant
that
was
given
to
mr.
rose
to
help
defray
the
cost
of
a
house
that
was
designed
to
meet
his
special
needs.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
it
comes
under
the...
no,
no,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
it
comes...
the
money
that
he
received
for
the
house
comes
from
a
special
grant
from
the
veterans
administration
for
people
who
need
to
have
homes
that--
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
--justice
o'connor,
it
is
my
understanding
that
any
money
which
comes
from
the
veterans
administration
is
subject
to
the
anti-attachment
provisions
in
3101.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
and
i
might
clear
one
point
on
that.
when
i
talk
in
terms
of
money
coming
from
the
veterans
administration,
that
is
money
which
comes
to
a
disabled
veteran.
any
money
that
comes
for
other
reasons
is
not
at
issue
here,
and
i
couldn't
answer
that
with
regards
to
money
that
might
come
through
the
veterans
administration
for
a
veteran
who
is
not
disabled.
the
situation
here
is
that
we
have
a
highly
decorated
vietnam
veteran
who
received
some
15
citations
including
the
vietnam
cross
of
gallantry,
the
bronze
star
for
valor,
and
the
purple
heart
among
the
others.
mr.
rose
lost
both
of
his
legs,
his
right
hand,
and
a
portion
of
his
right
arm
in
addition
to
his
right
eye
in
combat
in
the
former
republic
of
vietnam.
as
a
result
of
those
injuries
mr.
rose
received
a
medical
discharge
from
the
united
states
army
and
was...
at
that
time
began
receiving
these
veterans
disability
benefits
which
are
at
issue
here
today.
while
he
was
recuperating
in
a
veterans
administration
hospital
he
met
mr.
rose
who
was
assigned
to
his
care.
a
courtship
followed
and
marriage
was
the
end
result
of
that
courtship
in
1973.
after
the
two
children,
and
about
ten
years
later,
mrs.
rose
filed
for
divorce,
was
granted
a
divorce
from
the
veteran,
and
was
awarded
custody
of
the
two
minor
children.
mr.
rose
was
despondent
at
that
time
to
the
point
that
he
was
probably
in
a
state
of
shock.
he
didn't
even
contest
this
at
that
time.
he
contested
none
of
this
at
that
time.
the
decision
became
final,
was
not
appealed
from.
mr.
rose
consulted
with
me
and
wanted
to
know
if
he
had
rights.
after
advising
him
that
in
my
opinion
he
may
have
rights
under
the
veterans'
benefits
act,
i
advised
him
that
if
he
did
not
pay
the
child
support
as
ordered
he
would
probably
go
to
jail.
mr.
rose
decided
to
enforce
his
federal
rights
and
stopped
making
child
support
payments
except
that
he
paid
the
sum
of
$90,
which
is
the
minimum
amount
that
is
designated
by
the
veterans
administration
for
the
benefit
of
the
children
who
are
not
living
with
the
veteran.
that
brought
it
to
a
head
real
quickly.
he
was
in
fact
incarcerated
for
a
short
period
of
time
and
we
brought
this
case
up
through
the
state
courts
and
are
now
here
asking
the
court,
this
court,
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states,
to
determine
whether
what
we
have
here
is
in
fact
a
levy,
an
attachment
or
a
seizure
of
these
veterans
disability
benefits.
the
logic
of
the
state
is
this--
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
--yes,
your
honor.
a
right
without
the
ability
to
assert
that
right
is
no
right
at
all.
in
this
case
the
states
are
saying,
"if
you
enforce
your
federal
rights
to
have
this
property,
unassignable,
then
you
lose
your
freedom.
"
"the
decision,
mr.
rose,
is
yours.
"
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
i
cannot
answer
that,
your
honor.
i
would
be
glad
to
brief
it,
if
it
would
shed
light
for
this
court.
we
think,
though,
that
the
act
of
congress
which
has
vested
jurisdiction
of
these
funds
for
child
support
matters
in
the
veterans
administration,
is
conclusive
and
controlling,
particularly
in
light
of
the
fact
that
there's
the
anti-attachment
provisions
in
the
law
which
is
very
similar
to
what
this
court
decided
in
hisquierdo
in
1979
and
mccarty
versus
mccarty
in
1981,
which
congress
re-examined
those
and
passed
new
laws
but
as
in
those
cases,
this
is
a
question
for
the
congress
to
determine
and
not
for
the
states
in
an
effort
to
override
or
circumvent
the
laws
which
congress
had
enacted.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
no,
justice
scalia.
that
is
not
what
the
law
is
at
all.
the
law
says
that...
i
think
the
purpose
or
the
intent
is
that
the
administrator
of
the
veterans
administration
is
in
a
better
position
to
weigh
the
needs
of
the
disabled
veteran
and
the
needs
of
the
family,
and
because
there
is
a
national
interest
involved
here,
raising
a
military
and
providing
for
the
military,
that
if
the
family
has
to
suffer
because
the
veteran's
needs
are
greater
than
the
family's
needs,
then
it's
because
it's
a
vital
national
interest.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
no,
your
honor.
the
veterans
administration
has
promulgated
regulations
wherein
a
custodial
parent
may
petition,
has
a
right
to
petition,
the
veterans
administration
and
then
the
benefits
will
be
apportioned
according
to
the
equities
of
the
case.
there
are
some
27,000
veterans'
former
spouses
receiving
money
through
that
procedure
at
the
present
time.
mr.
jerry
s.
jones
your
honor,
i
would
be
reluctant
to
respond
to
that.
i
think
congress
has
spoken
with
force
and
clarity
in
this
matter
and
i
think
that
they
have
made
the
decision.
i
think
that
they
have
weighed
it,
and
if
they
are
wrong
i
am
sure
they'll
re-evaluate
their
position.
