mr.
roger
clegg
i
will
address
that,
and
feel
free
to
remind
me
if
i
overlook
that.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case
is
whether
a
state
court
can
require
a
divorced
veteran
to
pay
over
part
of
his
disability
benefits
for
child
support,
or
whether
that
kind
of
apportionment
can
be
made
only
by
the
veterans
administration.
this
case
is
not
about
whether
appellees
should
get
child
support
from
mr.
rose's
benefits
or
even
about
how
much
child
support
she
should
get.
it
is
about
who
decides
these
questions,
the
state
court
or
the
veterans
administration.
mr.
roger
clegg
that
is
correct.
mr.
roger
clegg
no,
there
was
not.
mr.
roger
clegg
let
me
give
the--
mr.
roger
clegg
--no,
there
was
not.
however,
it
is
clear
from
the
proceedings
that
the
court
knew
that
the
payments
would
have
to
come
from
these
veterans
disability
benefits,
and
the
court
said...
knew
that,
and
saying
that
said
to
mr.
rose,
"pay
this
child
support
that
you
have
fallen
behind
in
or
you
will
go
to
jail.
"
mr.
roger
clegg
why
isn't
it
a
seizure?
i
think
that
our
argument
is
that
reading
38
u.s.c.
3101(a),
it
is
an
attachment
levy
or
seizure.
3101(a)
reads,
"payments
of
benefits
due
or
to
become
due
under
any
law
administered
by
the
veterans
administration
shall
be
exempt
from
taxation,
shall
be
exempt
from
the
claim
of
creditors,
and
shall
not
be
liable
to
attachment,
levy
or
seizure
by
or
under
any
legal
or
equitable
process
whatever--
"
mr.
roger
clegg
--"#
before
or
after"--
mr.
roger
clegg
--your
honor,
the--
mr.
roger
clegg
--that's
right,
and
he
would
get
it
and
if
he
was
willing
to
stay
in
jail
he
could
continue
to
receive
it.
that's
correct.
i
don't
think
that
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
3101.
i
don't
think
that--
mr.
roger
clegg
--that's
right,
and
that's
the
second
string
to
our
bow,
is
that
we
think
that
mrs.
rose
here
is
a
creditor.
if
that
is
correct,
then
the
language
of
attachment,
levy
and
seizure
need
not
be
met.
again,
though,
i
don't
think
it
is
proper
to
read
the
evidently
very
broad
language
of
section
3101
in
such
a
narrow
fashion,
and
the
court
in
the
hisquierdo
case
was
reading
an
almost
identically
worded
section
231-m
and
did
not
feel
so
constrained.
family
law--
mr.
roger
clegg
--the
judgment,
fine,
but
when
the
court
turns
to
him
and
says,
"pay
this
or
go
to
jail--
"
mr.
roger
clegg
--i
think
that
it
is
in
this
context
where,
you
know,
the
sheriff
was
there
and
the
court
turned
to
the
sheriff
and
said,
you
know,
"take
him
into
custody",
and
where
he
was
in
fact
in
custody
an
incarcerated
in
this
case.
mr.
roger
clegg
i'm
sorry?
mr.
roger
clegg
well,
i
think
that
even...
i'm
not
sure
about
that,
justice
blackmun.
i
think
that
because
in
this
case
he
was
in
fact
put
in
jail,
even
if
the
court
order
was
not
violative
of
section
3101,
that
the
judgment
of
the
tennessee
court
of
appeals
affirming
that
order
was.
mr.
roger
clegg
that's
correct,
but--
mr.
roger
clegg
--i
believe
that
the
sequence
was
that
that
order
was
entered.
there
was
a
hearing
where
mr.
rose
said,
"i
don't
believe
that
i
have
to
pay
this
until
the
veterans
administration
has
apportioned
the
amount.
"
the
court
said,
"i
don't
believe
that
that's
what
the
law
is.
"
"pay
it
or
you
will
go
to
jail.
"
they
conferred,
counsel
and
mr.
rose
conferred
and
came
back
to
the
court
and
said,
"well,
we're
going
to
stand
on
our
rights.
"
and
the
judge
said,
"fine,
you're
going
to
jail.
"
and
he
went
to
jail.
mr.
roger
clegg
that's
our
best
argument,
your
honor.
mr.
roger
clegg
well,
there
has
been
a
divergence
of
opinion
on
that,
justice
o'connor,
and
as
appellant
state
point
out,
this
law
was...
3101
was
enacted
in
these
terms
in
1935.
in
1932
there
was
an
idaho
supreme
court
decision
which
upholds
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
in
1933
there
was
the
tennessee
state
court
decision
which
upholds
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
in
1936,
the
year
afterwards,
there
was
a
new
york
state
court
opinion
upholding
the
government's
position
in
this
case.
so,
i
think
that
you
are
quite
right
that
there
is
a
line
of
authority
that
treats
alimony
and
child
support
differently,
but
i
don't
think
that
that
authority
is
so
clear
that
it
can
override
the
very
explicit
and
broad
language
in
this
statute,
which
this
court
said
in
the
porter
versus
aetna
case,
is
to
be
construed
broadly.
mr.
roger
clegg
i
believe
that
it
would
be,
justice
o'connor,
because
3101,
as
i
said,
"payments
of
benefits
due
or
to
become
due
under
any
law
administered
by
the
veterans
administration.
"
i
should
add
that
the
$7,000
that
you
brought
up,
mr.
rose
filed
an
affidavit
saying,
you
know,
before
the
tennessee
court
saying
that
that
money
was
no
longer
available
at
the
time.
so,
it
was
clear
to
the
court
that
mr.
rose
was
going
to
have
to
make
this
payment
out
of
veterans
disability
benefits
or
go
to
jail.
it's
quite
clear.
mr.
roger
clegg
that's
right.
mr.
roger
clegg
that's
right.
i
mean,
we
think
that
3101
is
sufficient
for
this
case.
but
it
is
not
our
only
argument.
there
is
the
fact
that
in
42
u.s.c.
659
and
662
where
congress
provided
explicitly
that
certain
federal
payments
could
be
subjected
to
legal
process
for
child
support,
it
exempted
any
payments
for
veterans
administration
payments.
this
is
similar
to
the
reasoning
that
the
court
used
in
the
mccarty
case.
and
as
you
say,
congress
said
in
38
u.s.c.
3107
that
the
veterans
administration
would
have
this
power.
i
should
add
that...
in
response
to
one
of
the
earlier
questions...
that
this
procedure
is
one
not
only
that
has
been
used
27,000
times
but
which
is
laid
out
in
the
regulations.
the
veterans
administration,
and
it's
a
regional
office
that
does
this,
so
it's
not
completely--
mr.
roger
clegg
--i
assume
it's
somewhere
in
tennessee.
mr.
roger
clegg
yes,
they
do,
and
in
fact
the
regulations
say
that
in
a
typical
apportionment
case
somewhere
between
20
and
50
percent
of
the
benefits
is
generally
an
equitable
amount.
in
this
case
that
would
come
out
to
$700
a
month,
almost
as
much--
mr.
roger
clegg
--that's
the
statutory
amount
that
is
automatically
given
a
veteran
when
he
has
an
additional
child
dependent.
but
the
va
is
not
limited
to
that
and
has
not
limited
themselves
to
that.
the
va
is
going
to
consider
the
same
factors
that
the
state
court
considered.
it
is
going
to
consider
the
need
of
the
veteran,
the
need
of
his
children,
their
other
income,
and
the
level
of
benefits
that
he
gets.
in
short,
i
think
that
congress
has
spoken
explicitly
to
this
question
and--
mr.
roger
clegg
--no
problem
with
that.
mr.
roger
clegg
i'm
sorry.
mr.
roger
clegg
yes.
that
$400--
mr.
roger
clegg
--yes.
mr.
roger
clegg
for
the
five
dollars,
yes.
the
court
can
consider
these
benefits
in
setting
child
support
payments.
it
can
take
all
his
other
money
away.
but
what
it
can't
do
is
touch
one
penny
of
those
veterans
benefits.
mr.
roger
clegg
that's
right.
mr.
roger
clegg
that
problem
is
avoided
if
you
go
to
veterans
administration
in
the
first
instance
and
if
you
go
to
the
state
court
in
the
first
instance
then
the
problem
is
going
to
arise
only
if
the
veteran
asserts
that
he
is
being
forced
to
pay
out
of
his
disability
benefits
and
then
the
burden
of
proof
is
going
to
be
on
him
to
show
that.
mr.
roger
clegg
yes,
justice
marshall,
and
in
this
instance
congress
set
out
a
statutory
scheme
that
provides
that
the
veterans
administration--
mr.
roger
clegg
--no,
it's
veterans
disability
benefits.
mr.
roger
clegg
yes.
mr.
roger
clegg
i
think
it
was
earned.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roger
clegg
well,
they
can
go
after
everything
except
for
the
disability.
mr.
roger
clegg
they
have
to
go
to
he
veterans
administration
in
that
situation.
mr.
roger
clegg
i
don't
think
that
that's
extreme.
that
is
the
statutory
scheme
that
congress
has.
the
veterans
administration
has
been
charged
with
the
care
of
veterans
and
overseeing
the
payment
of
their
benefits.
mr.
roger
clegg
that's
fine.
mr.
roger
clegg
yes.
the
regulation...
if
i
can
complete
this
answer--
mr.
roger
clegg
--money
can
go
directly
to
the
children
in
this
situation.
that
is
what
would
happen.
it
would
go
to
the
children
through
the
former
spouse.
mr.
roger
clegg
the
regulations
say
that
payment
can
be
made
to
estranged
spouses.
i
don't
know
if
that
includes
ex-spouses.
mr.
roger
clegg
i'm
not
sure
whether--
mr.
roger
clegg
--well,
mainly
the
27,000
figure
is
to
show
that
apportionments
are
not
something
that
are
never
made
by
the
va.
there
are--
mr.
roger
clegg
--no,
we
don't.
i
mean,
it
could
be
all
or
it
could
be
none.
mr.
roger
clegg
thank
you.
