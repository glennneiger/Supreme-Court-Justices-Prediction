mr.
jones,
let
me
straighten
myself
out
on
some
factual
matters.
the
marriage
of
these
two
people
took
place
after
his
vietnam
injuries,
i
take
it?
he
was
fully
disabled
when
they
were
married?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
the
children
came
along
also
after
the
disability?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
the
tennessee
courts
order...
do
any
more
than
to
require
that
he
pay
$800
a
month?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
eight
hundred
dollars,
whatever
the
figure
was.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
did
it
do
any
more
than
that?
it
did
not
direct
any
allocation
of
the
disability
benefits
directly?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
the
order
itself
merely
placed
on
him
an
obligation
to
pay
$800
a
month.
if
he
had
acquired
it
from
inherited
wealth,
he
could
pay
it
out
of
that,
couldn't
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
and
the
order
did
not
tell
him...
or
did
it,
that
is
what
i
am
asking...
to
use
$800
of
your
disability
payment
to
satisfy
the
support
obligation?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
suppose
he
had
inherited
some
money
in
the
meantime?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
has
to
be
your
position,
isn't
it,
that
it
equates
with
an
attachment,
or
if
you
will,
a
garnishment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
why
does
that
equate
with
an
attachment
or
a
garnishment?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
but
where
was
this--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--where
was
the
attachment
or
garnishment
or
seizure
anywhere
along
the
line?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
the
veterans
administration
still
paid
it
monthly
direct
to
the
veteran?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
the
only
position
you
can
take,
isn't
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
the
only
position
you
can
take.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
clegg,
suppose
that
he
had
$400
a
month
income
from
some
independent
source,
some
retirement.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
you
mean,
no
problem?
wouldn't
you
be
taking
the
same
position
here
because
$400
is
only
one-half
of
$800?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that
$400
would
have
to
come
out
of
his
disability
payment?
wouldn't
you
be
making
the
same
argument
here?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
suppose
it
were
$795,
and
five
dollars
that
he
had
to
use
out
of
the
disability
payment--
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
--you
still
would
be
here
for
the
$500?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so,
each
month,
then,
one
would
have
to
look
at
his
independent
income
to
see
whether
there
is
a
violation
of
the
statute,
each
month?
he
might
in
some
month
have
$805
from
independent
income?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
that's
not
a
very
good
system,
is
it?
