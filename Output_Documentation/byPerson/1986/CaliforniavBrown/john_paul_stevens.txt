mr.
bloom,
may
i
follow
up
on
a
question
that
justice
o'connor
asked
you
about
the
adequacy
of
the
instructions
to
take
into
consideration
the
mitigating
evidence,
and
i
have
in
mind
particularly
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor
at
the
joint
appendix
at
page
90
and
91
where
he
refers
to
the
fact
that
they
brought
in
a
parade
of
relatives
who
talked
about
the
background
of
the
defendant
as
a
child
and
then
argued
that
that
testimony
was
a
blatant
attempt
by
the
defense
to
inject
personal
feelings
in
the
case
to
make
the
defendant
appear
human,
to
make
you
feel
for
the
defendant
and
so
forth,
but
that
the
judge
would
in
effect
tell
you
that
you
must
not
be
swayed
by
sympathy.
doesn't
that
suggest
that
the
judge
was
in
effect
directing
the
jury
not
to
consider
that
kind
of
mitigating
evidence?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
understand
that,
but
is
there
an
instruction
in
there
that...
i
don't
think...
you
responded
to
justice
o'connor,
i
believe,
by
referring
to
the
instruction
that
says,
you
should
not...
you
may
consider
matters
that
reduce
the
character
of
the
offense
or
of
the
crime,
the
quality
of
the
crime.
but
is
there
anything
that
suggests
to
the
jury
that
they
may
consider
the
sympathetic
aspects
of
the
defendant's
personal
history?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
allows
them
to
do
it,
but
does
it
tell
them
to
do
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
none
of
those
mentioned
his
background,
his
personal
background?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but,
mr.
bloom,
on
that
point
the
state
court's
opinion
first
states
the
instruction
and
then
it
goes
on
to
say,
"the
prosecutor
made
similar
arguments
both
during
the
voir
dire
of
the
jurors
and
the
close
of
the
penalty
case.
"
"defendant
contends
that
these
admonishments.
"
--that
is,
covering
both
the
instruction
and
the
prosecutor's
argument,
and
then
it
goes
on
and
says,
"defendant
is
correct".
so,
it
seems
to
me
the
ruling
of
the
court
that
we
are
reviewing
is
one
that
relied
on
both
the
argument
and
the
instruction.
