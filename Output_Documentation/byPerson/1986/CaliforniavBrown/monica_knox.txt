ms.
monica
knox
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
1976
in
gregg
versus
georgia
this
court
noted
that
the
admission
of
relevant
mitigating
evidence
under
fair
procedural
rules
is
not
alone
sufficient
to
guarantee
that
the
information
will
be
properly
used
in
the
determination
of
punishment,
especially
if
the
sentencing
is
performed
by
a
jury.
respondent
here
was
allowed
to
put
on
all
of
his
mitigating
evidence.
the
problem
was
that
he
was
denied
the
proper
use
of
that
evidence
by
the
prosecutor's
argument
and
the
court's
instructions.
i
think
it
is
worthwhile
to
spend
a
minute
or
two
on
some
of
the
facts.
i
have
no
quarrel
with
what
mr.
bloom
has
said
about
the
facts.
i
would
just
like
to
add
a
few
comments.
respondent
put
on
a
substantial
amount
of
mitigating
evidence
at
the
penalty
phase
of
his
trial.
he
put
on
several
family
members
who
testified
that
he
was
a
quiet,
loving
youngster
and
young
man,
that
he
had
been
devastated
at
a
very
early
age
by
the
divorce
of
his
parents
and
the
separation
from
his
father,
and
that
he
cared
very
much
for
his
family
members,
keeping
up
relationships
with
them
even
while
he
was
in
prison.
in
addition,
respondent
presented
the
testimony
of
a
psychiatrist
who
indicated
that
respondent
had
severe
psychosexual
problems,
that
they
were
based
primarily
on
a
grossly
distorted
sexual
upbringing
by
his
mother.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
all
of
this
evidence
came
in
without
objection.
ms.
monica
knox
no,
he
didn't.
the
psychiatrist
further
indicated
that
respondent
was
not
a
sociopath,
that
he
was
regularly
employed.
he
valued
education.
he
kept
close
relationships
with
family
and
friends,
that
his
behavior
was
sexually
and
not
violently
motivated,
and
that
he
presented
no
danger
in
an
all-male
prison
population.
respondent
testified
on
his
own
behalf.
he
echoed
the
pleas
of
his
family
members
and
asked
the
jury
to
show
him
mercy.
at
the
end
of
all
this
evidence
the
judge
instructed
the
jury
in
the
instructions
that
mr.
bloom
has
indicated
to
this
court.
the
prosecutor
exploited
these
instructions
in
his
argument
by
emphasizing
the
duty
of
the
jury
to
follow
the
law
as
the
court
would
give
it
to
them.
he
argued
that
all
the
factors
that
the
court
would
list
for
them
to
consider
were
aggravating
factors,
that
no
mitigating
evidence
had
been
presented
on
any
of
them.
he
repeatedly
warned
the
jurors
against
personal
emotions
of
sympathy,
compassion
or
mercy.
ms.
monica
knox
respondent's
position
is
that
the
anti-sympathy
instruction
alone
is
unconstitutional
in
all
circumstances.
but
i
really
believe
that
the
issue
before
this
court
can
be
and
is
much
narrower
than
that.
that
is,
this
is
really
a
straightforward
lockett
case.
respondent
put
on
a
lot
of
mitigating
evidence
and
yet
nothing
in
the
instructions
that
were
given
to
the
jury
adequately
told
them
that
they
could
consider
that
mitigation.
in
fact,
the
instructions
really
told
them
that
they
couldn't
consider
that
mitigation.
that
was
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor,
and
if
the
prosecutor
understood
and
interpreted
that
instruction
that
way,
it
certainly
is
likely
that
at
least
one
if
not
more
of
the
jurors
understood
the
instruction
in
that
way.
ms.
monica
knox
it
certainly
does.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
i
believe
that
this
court
has
taken
this
case
to
review
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court.
that
decision
was
that
the
anti-sympathy
instruction,
together
with
the
other
restrictive
penalty
instructions,
did
not
allow
the
jury
to
properly
consider
respondent's
mitigating
evidence.
and
i
believe
that
that
is
the
decision
that
is
on
review
in
this
court,
and
that
that's
the
issue
that
this
court
is
considering.
ms.
monica
knox
what
the
order
said
was
restricted
to
the
first
question
presented
in
the
petition
for
cert.--
ms.
monica
knox
--which
was,
whether
the
giving
of
an
anti-sympathy
instruction
was
unconstitutional.
ms.
monica
knox
no,
it
doesn't,
and
i
don't
believe
that
respondent's
argument
hinges
on
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor.
i
think
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor
is
relevant
because
it
indicates
the
type
of
interpretation
that
people
schooled
in
the
law
give
to
these
instructions.
ms.
monica
knox
no,
there
was
not
an
objection
made
to
the
prosecutor's
argument.
but
this
really
is
an
instructional
case,
as
i
said.
i
don't
believe
the
argument
hinges
on
the
prosecutor's
argument.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
i
think
that
brings
up
the
issue
of
california
versus
ramos,
which
the
state
seems
to
be
relying
on
very
heavily.
in
a
footnote
in
that
opinion,
this
court
did
say
that
the
california
penal
code,
section
190.3,
was
consistent
with
lockett
principles.
what
penal
code
section
190.3
says
before
it
gets
to
the
list
of
factors
that
the
jury
is
to
be
instructed
on
is
that
the
defendant
should
be
able
to
present
evidence
on
any
matter
relevant
to
mitigation
including
evidence
of
his
character,
background,
history,
mental
condition
and
physical
condition.
that
is
quite
consistent
with
lockett.
the
problem
is
the
very
problem
that
existed
in
eddings.
eddings
was
allowed
to
introduce
all
his
evidence
without
limitation.
the
problem
was
that
the
sentencer
didn't
consider
the
evidence.
that
is
the
very
problem
that
exists
in
this
case.
respondent
clearly
was
allowed,
without
objection,
to
present
all
of
his
mitigating
evidence.
the
problem
comes
with
instructions
to
the
jury.
the
jury
was
not
told
that
they
were
to
consider
that
mitigating
evidence.
and
so
we're
left--
ms.
monica
knox
--i
think
there
are
two
answer
to
that.
one
has
to
do
with...
this
instruction
was
not
given
by
itself.
it
was
given
with
an
antisympathy
instruction
which
i'll
get
to
in
a
minute.
but
more
important
than
that,
it
seems
to
me
that
when
you
say
there
are
other
factors
that
don't
go
to
the
narrowness
of
the
crime,
there
are
two
factors
in
this
whole
list
that
don't
go
to
that
crime.
one
is
the
age
of
the
defendant
and
the
other
is
his
prior
criminal
activity.
all
the
rest
of
those
factors
listed
have
to
do
with
what
the
defendant
was
like
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
was
he
acting
under
physical
impairment?
was
he
acting
under
the
duress
of
another?
but,
it
all
has
to
do
with
what
he
was
like
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
when
you
get
to
factor
"k",
the
very
wording
of
the
instruction
restricts
it
to
a
consideration
of
what
happened
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
it
says,
"any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
even
though
it
is
not
a
legal
excuse
for
the
crime.
"
it
talks
just
like
all
the
other
factors
do
about
what
defendant
was
like
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
and
i
think
that's
the
problem.
if
you
look
at
the
opinion
of
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
easley,
they
said
that
was
the
problem.
and
now,
since
1983
and
since
the
opinion
in
easley,
what
courts
are
instructing
juries
about
penalty
is...
there's
another
sentence
that
is
added
to
factor
"k"
which
says,
"or
any
other
evidence
the
defendant
offers
as
a
basis
for
a
sentence
less
than
death.
"
that
tells
the
jury,
it's
that
language
that
tells
the
jury
that
evidence
that
isn't
connected
directly
to
the
crime--
ms.
monica
knox
--it's
now
in
the
standard
caljic
instruction.
it
was
developed
by
the
california
supreme
court
in
people
versus
easley.
ms.
monica
knox
yes.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
because
of
what
the
jury
is
supposed
to
be
doing
at
the
penalty
phase,
that
it's
clear
from
decisions
of
this
court
that
what
the
jury
does
in
the
penalty
phase
is
not
a
rigid
and
mechanical
parsing
of
statutory
factors;
that
it's
a
highly
discretionary
decision,
it
calls
for
a
highly
subjective
opinion
by
the
jurors;
that
it
calls
not
just
for
their
legal
and
factual
judgment
about
the
evidence
they
heard
but
it
calls
for
their
moral
assessment
and
their
moral
judgment
of
that
evidence
too.
i
think
that
to
classify
sympathy--
ms.
monica
knox
--well,
i
think
the--
ms.
monica
knox
--no,
i
don't
think
that's
the
next
case,
because
i
think
that...
well,
i
think
if
the
judge
were
to
instruct
the
jury
to
disregard
emotion
and
not
say
anything
further,
yes,
that
would
be
wrong.
there
are
clearly
some
types
of
emotion
such
as
prejudice,
for
example,
which
are
not
supposed
to
play
a
part
in
the
jury's
determination,
whether
at
guilt
or
at
a
penalty
trial.
but
it's
also
clear
that
there
are
many
emotions
which
validly
play
a
part
in
the
jury's
determination
at
penalty,
for
example,
retribution.
retribution
is
the
primary
justification
for
a
death
sentence.
retribution
is
clearly
an
emotion,
and
yet
it
plays
a
proper
part
in
the
jury's
determination
at
penalty.
in
gregg
versus
georgia,
this
court
said
that
the
instinct
for
retribution
is
part
of
the
nature
of
man.
the
same
thing
is
true
with
sympathy.
sympathy
is
a
natural
reaction
on
the
part
of
jurors
to
the
type
of
mitigating
evidence
that
respondent
presented
in
this
case.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
first
of
all,
i
don't
believe
it
is
a
correct
reading
of
the
instruction
because--
ms.
monica
knox
--yes,
i
think
it's
objectionable
because
it's
very
unclear
what
that
means.
i
mean,
the
state
makes...
in
its
pleading
has
made
much
of
the
idea
that
this
is
mere
sympathy,
that
what
that
means
is
that
it's
untethered
sympathy.
well,
it's
not
entirely
clear
to
me
what
untethered
sympathy
means.
if
it
means
sympathy
that's
not
based
on
evidence
but
sympathy
that
just
comes
out
of
the
sky,
then
it
seems
to
me
we
have
dealt
with
the
exclusion
of
that
by
the
witherspoon
whip
process.
we
have
gotten
rid
of
those
people
who
are
just
going
to
bring
in
some
type
of
emotion
because
they're
against
the
death
penalty,
for
example;
that
once
you've
gotten
past
that
stage
and
you're
at
the
penalty
stage
and
they've
heard
all
this
evidence,
it
seems
to
me
that
if
they
have
a
feeling
of
sympathy
and
they
have
a
sympathetic
response
to
the
evidence
and
they
want
to
exercise
mercy
for
the
defendant,
that
is
clearly
constitutionally
valid
and
to
tell
them
"mere
sympathy",
what
the
"mere"
does
is
imply
that
there's
something
wrong
with
sympathy.
it
doesn't
tell
them
there
are
different
types
of
sympathy,
some
of
which
apparent
and
some
of
which
are
not.
ms.
monica
knox
and
i
think
we
can
do
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
jury...
when
you
tell
the
jury
that
they
can't
consider
sympathy,
that
because
we
believe
that
juries
pay
attention
to
jury
instructions
and
they
follow
them,
the
jury
is
going
to
try
to
make
some
sense
of
what
that
means
in
the
context
of
the
decision
that
they're
supposed
to
be
making.
ms.
monica
knox
i
don't
think
you
need
an
instruction
for
that
because
i
think
that
just
naturally
happens.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
i
think
that
the
comments
this
court
has
made
in
cases
such
as
gregg
versus
georgia
indicate
that
you
would,
yes.
ms.
monica
knox
yes.
ms.
monica
knox
i
think
that
without
telling
the
jury
that,
though,
that
that
in
fact
does
happen,
that
that...
in
part,
that's
my
point,
that
these
are
all
very
natural
reactions.
ms.
monica
knox
let's
say
the
jury
makes
their
best
attempt
to
do
that.
then
what
good
has
respondent's
mitigating
evidence
done
him?
i
mean,
he
might
as
well
have
not
introduced
it.
if
the
jury
cannot
use
their
sympathetic
response
to
that
evidence
and
decide
whether
to
exercise
mercy
for
respondent,
or
for
a
capital
defendant,
then
the
defendant
might
as
well
not
put
on
the
mitigating
evidence.
it's
the
only
use
their
mitigating
evidence
has,
and
if
you
tell
the
jury
that
they
can't
use
it
that
way,
essentially
what
you're
doing
is
telling
the
jury
not
to
pay
any
attention
to
the
mitigation
at
all.
ms.
monica
knox
yes,
because
to
say
that
you
put
the
aggravating
evidence
on
one
side
and
the
mitigating
evidence
on
the
other
side
makes
it
sound
like
what
you're
doing
is
something
that
is
very
mechanical,
that
all
you
do
is,
you
know,
see
how
many
are
over
here
and
see
how
many
are
over
there,
and
whatever
side
has
the
most
number
wins.
well,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
said
in
barclay
versus
florida,
that
is
not
what
a
capital
sentencing
proceeding
is
about.
it
is
not
a
mechanical
parsing
out
of
statutory
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors.
ms.
monica
knox
yes,
i
think
it
is
forbidden
by
this
instruction.
i
think
that
the
sense
that
a
jury
would
make
of
this
instruction
is
that
any
feelings
of
leniency
they
have
for
the
defendant
are
totally
unacceptable
feelings,
and
that
they
cannot
act
on
them;
that
if
they
want
to
exercise
mercy
towards
the
defendant
because
of
the
mitigating
evidence
they've
heard
about
his
background,
that
they
cannot
do
it.
ms.
monica
knox
no,
i
don't
think
it
did,
but
one
of
the
factors
specifically
given
to
the
jury
as
something
they
could
consider,
the
age
of
the
defendant.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
i
think
the
factor
of
age
can
work
in
several
different
ways.
it
can
work
as
aggravating,
for
example,
and
in
many,
many
cases
in
california
it's
argued
that
way.
i
believe
that
it
can
work
as
mitigating
in
a
case,
if
you
have
a
very
young
defendant,
for
example,
i
believe
it
could
be
mitigating
to
the
jury.
ms.
monica
knox
well,
i
think
that
you
have
to
look
at
the
instruction
carefully,
though.
what
it
says
is,
any
mental
disturbance
at
the
time
of
the
crime.
it
does
not
indicate
that
a
prior
or
subsequent
mental
disturbance
is
at
all
relevant
to
the
jury
determination.
but,
see,
if
you
believe...
let's
say
that
there
was
a
mental
disturbance
at
the
time
of
the
crime,
and
that's
one
of
the
things
that
the
jury
is
specifically
told
on
their
list
of
factors
to
consider.
if
you
believe
that
they
will
consider
that
as
mitigation,
i
think
that
you're
quite
right,
justice
white,
that
the
way
they
consider
it
as
mitigation
is
if
they
have
a
sympathetic
response
to
that
evidence.
the
problem
is
when
you
give--
ms.
monica
knox
--i
believe
that
there
is
a
sympathetic
component
in
that
analysis.
ms.
monica
knox
yes,
i
believe
that's
exactly
what
the
instruction
does.
first
of
all,
the
standard
instruction
listing
the
factors
doesn't
tell
them
they
can
even
consider
that
type
of
evidence.
but
assuming
that
they
were
given
a
more
expansive
standard
instruction
telling
them
that
they
could
consider
that
type
of
evidence,
then
i
think
what
happens
when
you
then
add
on
top
of
that
an
anti-sympathy
instruction
is
that,
what
you
have
done
is
you
have
give
them
conflicting
jury
instructions.
on
the
one
hand,
you've
told
them
to
consider
it
and
to
consider
it
there
is
a
sympathetic
component
in
the
consideration,
and
on
the
other
hand
you
have
told
them
they
can't
weigh
that
sympathetic
component.
and
so,
i
think
at
the
very
least
what
you
have
done
is
hopelessly
confuse
the
jury.
ms.
monica
knox
there
is
a
word
"mere"
in
the
instruction.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
in
fact,
if
anything
i
think
that
probably
confuses
the
issue
much
more.
i
mean,
what
the
instruction
says
is
not
to
be
influenced
by
mere
sentiment,
conjecture,
sympathy,
et
cetera.
now,
if
the
"mere"
modified
"sympathy"
as
is
being
suggested,
it
modifies
every
term
in
the
instruction.
and
therefore
it
would
modify,
for
example,
"prejudice".
well,
then
what
it
means
is,
you
are
telling
the
jury
is
not
to
be
influenced
by
mere
prejudice,
suggesting
that
prejudice
is
okay
as
long
as
it
rises
above
the
level
of
"mere".
well,
it
seems
to
me
that
type
of
analysis--
ms.
monica
knox
--perhaps
it's
not,
your
honor,
but
i
think
that
we
have...
we're
dealing
with
a
decision
between
a
defendant's
life
and
death,
and
we
should
be
very
careful
what
we
tell
jurors.
maybe
we
have
to
be
more
careful
about
what
we
tell
jurors.
ms.
monica
knox
and
i'm
not
advocating
that
we
should.
i
would
like
to
correct
an
assumption
which
i
think
your
honor
has,
and
that
is
that
there
are
170
cases
that
rely
on
this.
this
instruction
has
been
against
california
law
for
many,
many
years.
this
is
only
the
third
case
that
the
california
supreme
court
has
considered
where
this
instruction
was
given
at
the
penalty
phase.
it
is
not
routinely
given,
and
there
are
nowhere
near
170
cases,
or
even
17
cases
in
california
where
this
instruction
was
given.
ms.
monica
knox
justice
lucas
was
not
referring
to
the
anti-sympathy
instruction,
your
honor.
there
is
a
second
part
of
the
brown
decision
which
is
not
before
this
court,
and
that
has
to
do
with
the
separate
penalty
instruction
which
was
give,
which
told
the
jury
that
if
they
found
aggravating
outweighed
mitigating
that
they
shall
impose
the
death
penalty.
it
is
that
instruction
that
is
routinely
given
to
penalty
juries,
and
that
is
what
justice
lucas
was
talking
about
when
he
said
that
there
were
a
lot
of
cases
which
that
instruction
was
given
in.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
there
are,
i
think,
about
seven
states
which
fairly
routinely
give
anti-sympathy
instructions
at
penalty.
ms.
monica
knox
i
don't
know.
i
know
illinois,
for
example,
is
one
of
them.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
interestingly,
florida
is
one
of
the
states
which
does
not
allow
an
anti-sympathy
instruction.
ms.
monica
knox
i'm
not
sure
about
texas,
your
honor.
ms.
monica
knox
no.
i
think
georgia
doesn't
allow
it,
because
i
did
speak
to
the
head
of
the
aclu
there.
ms.
monica
knox
i
don't
know
about
alabama.
ms.
monica
knox
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know.
ms.
monica
knox
maybe
so,
but
the
whole
penalty
decision
cannot
be
a
totally
rational,
objective
decision.
it
is
a
very
subjective,
discretionary
decision
by
its
nature.
we
cannot
make
it
totally
rational.
it's
true
that--
ms.
monica
knox
--well,
but
to
try
with
an
anti-sympathy
instruction
is
essentially
to
tilt
the
scale
towards
death
for
a
defendant.
yes,
it
is
possible
that
if
you
allow
the
jury
to
consider
sympathy,
that
some
jurors
will
have
sympathy
for
the
victim.
i
think
that
happens
whether
you
allow
the
jury
to
consider
sympathy
or
not.
but
in
the
end,
it's
all
the
capital
defendants
have
going
for
them
at
the
penalty
trial.
they
get
to
the
penalty
stage
of
the
capital
proceeding
because
they
have
been
convicted
of
a
very
serious
crime
that
is
essentially
an
unmitigated
crime,
that
as
justice
groden
in
the
brown
opinion
noted,
that
the
issue
is
not
really
between
good
and
bad,
is
this
defendant
a
good
man
or
is
he
a
bad
man,
do
we
give
him
death
or
life
based
on
that.
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
we
are
dealing
with
very
serious
offenders
who
generally
have
very
serious
criminal
backgrounds,
that
the
only
thing
that
they
have
going
for
them
in
terms
of
getting
the
jury
to
opt
for
a
decision
of
life
is
a
sympathetic
response
to
their
evidence
in
the
hope
that
they
will
exercise
mercy.
respondent
literally
staked
his
life
on
the
hope
that
the
jury
would
do
that
in
this
case,
that
they
would
listen
to
his
evidence,
that
they
would
consider
it,
that
they
would
have
a
sympathetic
response
to
it,
and
that
they
would
exercise
mercy
for
him.
and
yet,
the
instructions
given
in
the
case
which
were
clearly
aggravated
by
the
prosecutor's
argument...
but
the
instructions
given
told
the
jury
that
they
could
not
do
that.
respondent
might
as
well
have
sat
mute
at
the
penalty
phase
for
all
the
good
putting
on
all
his
evidence
did.
ms.
monica
knox
as
long
as
it's
clear
to
the
jury
that
factors
such
as
sympathy,
compassion
and
mercy
can
be
considered.
and
the
reason
i
say
that
i
would
allow
for
the
exclusion
of
emotion
is
because
there
are
some
emotions
such
as
prejudice,
for
example,
which
clearly
should
not
play
a
part
in
the
jury's
determination.
ms.
monica
knox
i
don't
think
that
we
can
constitutionally
eliminate
compassion.
it's
the
very
basis
for
a
decision
such
as
findings,
that
if
you
eliminate
compassion,
if
you
eliminate
the
types
of
things
that
we're
talking
about,
defendants
at
a
penalty
trial
have
absolutely
no
chance
at
all
of
getting
a
life
verdict
out
of
their
jury.
ms.
monica
knox
yes.
i
think
that
one
of
the
things
that
is
rather
telling
about
this
instruction
is
that
the
instruction
was
developed
for
the
guilt
phase
of
the
trial.
in
fact,
the
use
note
in
the
standard
caljic,
the
book
of
jury
instructions
in
california,
specifically
tells
judges
not
to
give
it
at
a
penalty
trial.
it
was
developed
for
a
guilt
trial
because
the
issue
there
is
much
more
of
an
objective
issue.
it
is
a
stage--
