justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that,
now?
that
the
prosecutor's
instructions...
the
prosecutor's
argument,
you
say,
are
not
before
us
and
cannot
be
considered?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
do
you
think
so?
i
mean,
in
addition
to
the
other
things
that
have
been
read,
he
said,
there
is
mitigation.
absence
of
criminal
activity,
no
mitigation,
right?
absence
of
prior
felony
conviction,
no
mitigation;
whether
or
not
the
victim
was
a
participant,
no
mitigation.
all
that's
true.
but
then
he
says,
no
mitigation,
no
mitigation,
no
mitigation.
age
of
the
defendant,
no
mitigation.
whether
or
not
the
defendant
was
accomplished,
no
mitigation.
other
circumstances,
no
mitigation.
now,
is
it
really
possible
to
say
that
there
was
no
mitigation
in
everything
that
had
been
brought
forward,
other
circumstances,
no
mitigation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
think
a
jury
could
reasonably
understand
that
polemic
language
that
way
if
the
instruction
were
clear
enough.
but
when
the
instruction
says,
"any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
"
the
gravity
of
the
crime,
you
know,
you
could
read
that
to
mean,
it
has
to
be
a
circumstance
connected
with
the
crime,
not
with
the
defendant's
prior
life.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
we
adhere
to
that
and
we
agree
that
the
instructions
alone
would
not
be
bad
but
combined
with
the
argument
would
be
bad,
what
would
we
do?
would
we
reverse
and
remand
to
the
state?
this
is
a
capital
case.
it
seems
to
me
we
want
it
to
come
out
right,
don't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
you
would
say,
then,
we
would
remand
for
separate
consideration
of
the
instruction...
of
the
argument
if
we
have
a
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
part
of
the
problem
is,
it's
not
just
the
instruction
in
this
case.
i'm
not
sure
of
the
appropriateness
of
it,
but
in
one
of
the
briefs
there
was
a
listing
of
instructions
in
other
cases
which
present
the
same
problem.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
mean
instructions.
i
mean,
arguments
by
the
prosecutor.
justice
antonin
scalia
except
it's
a
little
hard
to
hear
the
state
come
before
us
and
tell
us,
listen,
all
this
excludes
is
emotion.
it
doesn't
mean
that
you
can't
take
into
account
all
these
other
factors,
but
then
to
read
the
argument
that
the
state
has
made
to
the
jury
in
a
number
of
cases
which
seems
to
say
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sure
it's
not
your
fault,
but
it
has
to
be
the
state's
fault.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
don't
know
that
that's
so.
you
know,
the
adversary
system
does
tend
to
produce
extravagant
statements
on
both
sides,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so,
that
isn't
necessarily
true,
it
seems
to
me.
what
have
we
accepted
cert
on?
do
you
agree
with
the
statement
of
the
state
that
the
only
point
that
we've
taken
this
case
for
is
the
sympathy
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
you're
making
your
case
weaker
than
it
is.
it
was
whether
the
giving
of
that
instruction
was
all
right
where
the
defendant
has
been
permitted
unlimited
opportunity
to
present
mitigating
evidence,
and
the
instruction
merely
advised
the
tryer
of
fact
not
to
consider
matters
not
relevant
to
the
offense
or
the
offender.
it
was
introducing
some
matters
beyond
the
mere
instruction,
the
opportunity
to
introduce
evidence,
at
least.
it
doesn't
mention,
however,
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor,
does
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
knox,
how
do
you
get
that?
if
i
read
it
together
with
the
argument,
i'm...
you
know,
i'm
on
your
side.
but
apart
from
the
argument,
why
would
you
read
the
instruction
that
way?
the
last
part
of
it
is...
the
residual
clause
is,
"any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime
even
though
it
is
not
a
legal
excuse
for
the
crime.
"
now,
the
argument
you
make
in
your
brief
is
that
the
jury
would
think
that
that
has
to
be
something
that
relates
narrowly
to
the
actual
commission
of
the
crime
itself.
but,
as
was
pointed
out
by
the
state
in
its
argument,
a
jury
wouldn't
reasonably
understand
it
that
way
since
before
subsection
k
a
lot
of
the
other
subsections
specifically
mention
factors
that
have
nothing
to
do
narrowly
with
the
commission
of
the
crime,
such
as
whether
there
was
any
prior
felony
conviction,
whether...
how
old
was
he,
and
so
forth.
it
seems
to
me,
in
that
context
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
read
"k"
alone
and
again,
leaving
aside
the
prosecutor's
argument,
it
would
be
unreasonable
to
read
that
to
say
there
has
to
be
something
about
the
narrow
circumstances
of
the
crime
as
opposed
to
the
defendant's
prior
history.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
that
new
language?
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course,
even
when
that's
given
you
would
still
come
in
and
object
if
the
anti-sympathy
instruction
were
given,
i
presume?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
the
use
of
the
word
"emotion"
too,
that
they
shouldn't
put
aside
their
emotions?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
is
that
the
next
case
after
we
disapprove
sympathy...
excluding
sympathy,
would
we
be
asked
to
disapprove
the
exclusion
of
emotion?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
think
we
would
approve
an
instruction
that
says
to
the
jury,
you
may
consider
your
feelings
of
retribution
in
deciding
what
penalty
to
impose;
you
may
consider
your
thirst
for
retribution?
i
gather
that
from
your
earlier
comments.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
i
know,
but
let's
assume
california
says,
let's
do
it,
and
they
have
an
instruction
like
that.
do
you
think
we'd
approve
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
the
state
in
setting
up
a
criminal
system
can
have
retribution
as
one
of
the
purposes
of
its
penal
system.
but
we
said
that
the
jury
can
be
instructed
that...
what
about
sympathy
for
the
victim?
would
we
approve
an
instruction
that
said,
you
may
consider
your
feelings
of
sympathy
including
sympathy
for
the
15-year
old
girl
who
was
raped
and
murdered?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
would?
well,
you're
consistent,
i'll
say
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
an
imperfect
world,
and
it
may
well
be
that
the
jury
doesn't
always
follow
instructions.
but
what
the
state
is
trying
to
do
is
saying,
you
know,
as
much
as
you
can,
put
aside
emotion.
put
aside
sympathy.
you're
right,
they
may
not
do
it
100
percent.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
use
under
the
california
instructions
is
that
you
put
the
aggravating
factors
on
one
side
and
the
mitigating
factors
on
the
other
side,
and
prescinding
from
emotion
or
sympathy,
the
california
courts
say,
you
decide
which
outweighs
the
other,
making
believe
you
are
an
emotionless
judge.
that's
what
they're
telling...
it
may
be
hard
to
do,
but
is
there
anything
wrong
with
asking
them
to
try
to
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
trouble
is,
you
don't
know
which
way
the
sympathy
is
going
to
break,
for
the
victim
or
the
offender,
and
that's
part
of
the
problem.
the...
whole
thrust
of
our
jurisprudence
in
this
field
has
been
to
try
to
eliminate
the
irrationality
of
capital
punishment,
to
try
to
prevent
one
person
getting
condemned
to
death
in
a
flukey
way
where
somebody
else
didn't,
and
sympathy
is
simply
not
tied
to
reason.
what
you
sympathize
with,
i
may
not
sympathize
with.
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have
been
trying.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
forgot
what
you
answered
before.
you
would
allow
the
exclusion
of
emotion,
you
would
allow...
say,
don't
be
swayed
by
emotion?
can
you
give
that
instruction?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
if
you
just
said
emotion,
it
would
probably
eliminate
compassion,
wouldn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
we
are
just
trying
to
figure
out
how
many
standard
instructions...
and
how
many
states
eliminate
emotion.
i
mean,
you
know,
i
would
certainly
put
that
in
an
instruction
all
the
time.
and,
you
think
that
would
be
bad
because
it's
too
broad?
