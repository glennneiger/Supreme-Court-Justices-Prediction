justice

mr.
bloom,
where
in
the
instructions
was
the
jury
told
that
it
should
consider
mitigating
evidence
about
the
background
and
the
character
of
the
defendant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
it
say...
was
the
instruction,
"any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime?
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
you
think
that
that
makes
it
clear
to
the
jury
that
they
could
consider
evidence
going
to
the
background
and
character
of
the
defendant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
doing
that,
did
we
have
before
us
an
argument
or...
like
the
prosecutor
made
here,
or
the
other
statements
that
were
made
to
the
jury?
maybe
that
catchall
instruction
is
a
little
bit
ambiguous,
but
what
happens
when
it's
coupled
with
the
argument
that
was
made
to
the
jury?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
did
the
defendant's
counsel
object
to
the
prosecutor's
argument
on
this
point?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
knox,
if
in
this
case
the
judge
had
not
given
the
instruction,
the
catchall
instruction
about
relevant
mitigating
evidence
as
to
the
crime
but
had
made
it
clear
in
that
instruction
that
the
jury
could
consider
evidence
going
to
the
background
and
character
of
the
defendant,
but
nevertheless
had
given
the
sympathy
instruction
that
the
state
petitioned
on,
would
you
be
making
this
same
argument?
does
that
sympathy
instruction
alone
necessitate
a
reversal,
in
your
view,
or
is
it
the
problem
of
the
companion
instructions?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
any
objection
made
to
the
prosecutor's
argument
at
trial?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
this
instruction,
though,
one
that
is
quite
common
nationwide?
i
recall,
certainly
in
the
state
of
arizona,
it
was
part
of
the
standard
instructions
in
that
state
for
years,
and
i
had
rather
assumed
that
it
was
given
all
over
the
country.
