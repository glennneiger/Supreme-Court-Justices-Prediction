was
there
any
objection
to
that
evidence
by
anybody?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judge
certainly
didn't
say,
what's
the
purpose
of
all
this?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
order
granting
certiorari?
justice
byron
r.
white
which
was?
justice
byron
r.
white
--some
evidence
that
may
suggest
to
the
jury
that
there
is
a
reason
for
forgiving
the
defendant
for
what
he
did,
is
that
forbidden
by
this
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
let's
take
age.
why
does
the
state
permit
that
as
a
mitigating
factor,
and
how
would
it
mitigate
if
the
jury...
i
take
it
you
think
this
instruction
forbade
the
jury
to
take
into
consideration
age?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
i
know,
but...
well,
i
take
it
that...
wouldn't
the
age
just
provoke
sympathy?
or,
what
would
it
do?
would
it
help...
would
it
say,
we
ought
to
forgive
him
for
this,
or
that,
it's
easy
to
understand
how
he
might
have
committed
this
crime?
what
is
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
any
mental
disturbances
or
anything
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
here's
the
evidence,
that
this
fellow's
been
a
good
man
all
his
life.
his
relatives
and
his
friends
say,
we
think
he's
great
and
this
is
just
a
temporary
lapse,
and
trying
to
convince
the
jury
that
this
man
will
be
all
right
in
the
long
run,
we
just
shouldn't
execute
him,
shouldn't
kill
him.
now,
is
that
sympathy?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
this
instruction
forbade
the
jury
from
taking
that
into
consideration,
saying,
well,
he
just
doesn't
deserve
the
death
penalty,
he's
probably
never
going
to
do
this
again,
this
was
one
of
those
crimes
of
passion
that
will
never
happen
again?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
the
word
"mere"...
isn't
the
word
"mere"
in
the
instruction?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
that
helps
any
either?
justice
byron
r.
white
death
penalty
statutes
that
have
produced
a
lot
of
people
on
death
rows?
what
states
are
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about
florida?
justice
byron
r.

texas?
justice

georgia?
