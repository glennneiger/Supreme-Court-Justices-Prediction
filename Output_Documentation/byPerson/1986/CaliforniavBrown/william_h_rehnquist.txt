we
will
hear
argument
now
in
number
85-1563,
california
versus
brown.
mr.
bloom,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bloom.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
knox.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
ms.
knox,
let
me
go
back
just
a
minute
to
your
own
view
of
the
proper
construction
of
the
question
presented
which
we
granted
certiorari
on.
it
talks
about
the
sympathy
instruction.
it
says,
"where
the
defendant
has
been
permitted
an
unlimited
opportunity
to
present
mitigating
evidence.
"
now,
you
don't
have
any
complaint,
do
you,
here
that
the
trial
court
excluded
mitigating
evidence
that
should
have
come
in?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
counsel,
the
language
in
the
instruction
here
was
qualified
by
the
word
"mere",
"mere
sympathy".
i
have
read
that
with
perhaps
not
full
regard
for
the
ejusdem
generis
rule
which
you
suggest
all
jurors
know,
as
meaning
that
you
don't
want
to
just
go
off
on
sympathy
alone
or
emotion
alone.
now,
if
that
were
a
correct
reading
of
that
instruction,
do
you
still
think
it's
objectionable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
if
it
were,
do
you
think
it
would
be
objectionable?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
know,
if
we
were
a
commission
or
a
committee
of
the
california
bar
sitting
down
to
compose
jury
instructions,
maybe
we
wouldn't
come
up
with
this
one.
but
to
win
your
case,
it
seems
to
me
you've
got
to
show
that
this
instruction
is
not
just
a
little
bit
off
the
mark
but
that
it's
actually
unconstitutional,
that
it
doesn't
come
within
the
latitude
that
pulley
and
ramos
said
there
are
for
states
within
the
capital
system.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
there
are
an
awful
lot
of
jury
instructions
that
have
never
been
challenged
by
any
responsible
defense
lawyer
which,
if
you
treated
them
as
if
you're
parsing
provisions
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
you
could
adduce
some
doubt
about
which
adjective
modified
which.
that
isn't
the
way
we
ordinarily
go
about
parsing
jury
instructions,
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
we
also,
if
there
are
170
cases
in
california
that
depend
on
whether
or
not
this
instruction
is
unconstitutional,
we
should
also
be
very
careful
not
just
to
get
into
a
very
arcane
word
game.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
didn't
one
of
the
dissenting
judges
make
some
comment
to
that
effect?
justice
lucas,
was
he
wrong
when
he
said
there
were
170
cases?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
ms.
knox.
thank
you.
mr.
bloom,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
seven
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
bloom.
the
case
is
submitted.
