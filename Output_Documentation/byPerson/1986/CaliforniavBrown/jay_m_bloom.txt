mr.
jay
m.
bloom
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
death
penalty
case
arising
out
of
riverside
county,
california,
and
it
involves
the
giving
of
an
instruction
at
the
penalty
phase
of
that
trial.
before
getting
into
the
instruction,
i
would
like
to
lay
out
a
little
of
the
procedure,
how
the
trial
occurs
in
california.
the
california
death
penalty
process
is
a
two-step
process.
at
the
first
step
the
jury
determines
the
guilt
or
innocence
of
the
defendant
and
determines
the
truthfulness
of
the
special
circumstances
allegation.
the
special
circumstances
allegation
is
used
to
narrow
the
category
of
first
degree
murderers
who
may
receive
the
death
penalty.
once
the
jury
determines
the
truthfulness
of
the
special
circumstances
allegation,
the
case
proceeds
to
the
penalty
phase
where
the
jury
may
return
a
verdict
of
death
or
life
without
possibility
of
parole.
now,
in
this
case
the
evidence
of
the
guilt
phase
showed
that
the
defendant
had
raped
and
murdered
a
young,
15-year
old
girl
and
then
called
the
parents
to
tell...
called
the
mother
to
indicate
she
would
never
see
her
daughter
alive
again.
the
jury
returned
a
verdict
finding
defendant
guilty
of
murder
in
the
first
degree
and
rape,
and
as
a
special
finding
found
the
murder
was
premeditated.
it
also
found
as
a
special
circumstance
that
the
murder
had
occurred
during
commission
of
a
rape.
at
the
penalty
phase
the
defendant
presented
evidence
of
remorse
of
a
prior
rape
and
evidence
of
sexual
dysfunction
and
evidence
from
his
family.
the
prosecution
presented
evidence
of
a
prior
rape.
the
jury
fixed
the
punishment
at
death,
after
hearing
three
instructions.
the
first
instruction
is
the
one
that
is
at
issue
before
this
court,
and
basically
it
says,
you
must
not
be
swayed
by
mere
sentiment,
conjecture,
sympathy,
passion,
prejudice,
public
opinion
or
public
feeling.
both
the
people
and
the
defendant
have
a
right
to
expect
that
you
will
conscientiously
consider
and
weigh
the
evidence
and
apply
the
law
to
the
case,
and
that
you
will
reach
a
just
verdict
regardless
of
what
the
consequences
of
such
verdict
may
be.
the
jury
was
also
instructed
that
they
were
to
take
into
account
and
be
guided
by
various
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
contained
in
instruction
known
as
8.84.1>
["].
that
laid
out
the
various
aggravating
and
mitigating
factors
and
also
indicated
the
jury
could
consider
any
other
circumstance
which
extenuated
the
gravity
of
the
offense,
even
though
not
a
legal
excuse
for
the
crime.
the
jury
was
finally
instructed
with
caljic
8.84.2
which
indicated
the
jury
could
consider,
take
into
account,
and
be
guided
by
the
applicable
factors
of
aggravation
and
mitigation
upon
which
it
had
been
instructed.
the
jury
was
then
told,
if
the
aggravating
factors
outweighed
the
mitigating
factors,
it
shall
impose
the
death
penalty.
however,
if
the
mitigating
factors
outweighed
the
aggravating
factors,
it
was
to
impose
a
punishment
of
life
without
possibility
of
parole.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
it
is
our
position,
your
honor,
that
caljic
8.481
which
deals
with
the
various
aggravating,
mitigating
factors,
it
discusses
the
jury
is
to
consider
the
circumstances
of
the
offense,
prior
violent
conduct,
any
mental
defects
of
the
individual,
and
under
the
"k"
section,
any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
offense,
even
though
not
a
legal
excuse.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
no.
the
exact
language,
your
honor,
was
"any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime
even
though
it
is
not
a
legal
excuse
for
the
crime.
"
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
yes,
your
honor,
because
in
the
first
place
this
instruction
tracks
exactly
penal
code
190.3
which
this
court
discussed
in
california
versus
ramos,
and
in
that
decision
this
court
indicated
in
footnote
19
of
the
opinion
that
the
instruction
allowed
the
jury
to
consider
all
evidence
to
show
a
penalty
less
than
death
was
appropriate
and
met
the
standards
of
lockett
versus
ohio.
this
court
also
noted,
citing
to
190.3,
that
the
california
scheme
like
the
texas
sentencing
scheme
insures
the
jury
will
hear
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
now,
in
addition,
in
pulley
versus
harris
which
dealt
with
the
1977
california
law,
this
court
had
occasion
to
also
discuss
190.3,
which
was
substantially
the
same
language,
and
the
court
indicated
that
the
statute
and
the
california
system
was
constitutional.
so,
since
the
instruction
given
here
tracks
exactly
190.3,
which
in
essence
has
been
upheld
by
this
court
in
ramos
and
pulley
versus
harris,
to
permit
a
defendant
to
present
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
it
is
our
position
that
the
instruction
does
allow
the
jury
to
consider
all
the
relevant
evidence.
basically,
what
the
position
of
the
state
in
this
case
is,
is
the
instruction
telling
the
jury
not
to
be
swayed
by
mere
sentiment,
sympathy,
conjecture;
tells
the
jury,
the
best
it
can,
to
divorce
itself
from
emotion.
what
these
factors
are,
are
not
mitigating
factors
but
are
motions
of
the
jurors,
as
justice
mosk
indicated
below
in
his
dissent
in
the
lamphear
decision.
and,
when
followed
by
caljic
8.481,
the
jury
then
is
to
consider
all
the
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
this
court
indicated
in
gardner
versus
florida
that
a
motion
has
no
place
in
decision
to
impose
the
death
penalty.
in
addition,
the
chief
justice,
dissenting
recently
in
caldwell
versus
mississippi,
indicated,
"there
is
nothing
wrong
with
urging
a
capital
sentencing
jury
to
disregard
a
motion
and
render
a
decision
based
on
the
law
and
the
facts.
"
he
then
said,
"i
do
not
understand
the
court
to
believe
that
motions
in
favor
of
mercy
must
play
a
part
in
the
ultimate
decision
of
a
capital
sentencing
jury.
"
"indeed,
much
of
our
eighth
amendment
jurisprudence
has
been
concerned
with
eliminating
emotion
from
sentencing
decisions.
"
it
is
our
position
that
what
these
instructions
do
is,
the
instruction
telling
the
jury
not
to
be
swayed
by
sentiment,
conjecture,
sympathy,
et
cetera,
tells
the
jury,
put
aside
these
emotions.
they
have
no
place
in
determining
life
or
death.
but
what
you
are
to
do
is
to
view
the
facts
and
the
law
as
given
to
you
in
caljic
8.84.1
and
caljic
8.84.2.
in
addition,
the
emotions
dealt
with
here,
sympathy,
sentiment
and
conjecture,
aren't
necessarily
beneficial
to
the
defendant
as
respondent
alleges
here.
sentiment,
sympathy
and
conjecture
could
just
as
likely
be
engendered
for
the
victim,
or
just
as
likely
be
engendered
against
the
defendant
in
a
death
penalty
case.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
i
think
we
would
be
here
because
the
court
below
indicated
that
the
instruction
as
a
whole
is
invalid.
it
didn't
deal
just
with
sympathy.
it
also
dealt
with
the
issue
of
just
verdict
and
consequences
of
the
verdict.
so,
all
these
factors
taken
together,
the
court
indicated,
were
inappropriate
for
the
jury
to
consider.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
no,
your
honor.
what
he
was
telling
the
jury
was
to
consider
the
facts
and
the
law.
at
the
opening
of
his
argument,
for
example,
he
says,
"you
are
not
to
consider
sympathy,
sentiment
or
any
of
these
factors.
"
but
then
he
goes
on
and
says,
"you
are
to
consider
the
mitigating
factors.
"
and
he
goes
through
them
and
lists
them.
that's
the
opening
of
the
prosecutor's
argument.
now,
in
addition
he
also
notes
at
one
point
in
his
argument
that
the
jurors
are
not
to
be
swayed
by
sympathy
for
the
victims.
they
are
to
consider
the
facts
and
the
law
of
the
case.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
i
think
my
point
was
that
the
instruction
as
a
whole
allows
the
jury
to--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
yes.
it
tells
them
that
they
are
to
take
into
account
and
be
guided
by
the
following
factors,
and
then
it
lists
the
various
factors
and
some
of
the
factors,
for
example,
are
the
age
of
the
defendant,
whether
at
the
time
of
the
offense
he
had
the
capacity
to
appreciate
the
criminality
of
his
conduct
or
to
conform
his
conduct
to
the
requirements
of
the
law,
whether
he
acted
under
duress
or
under
substantial
domination
of
another
person,
whether
the
offense
was
committed
under
a
circumstance
which
the
defendant
reasonably
believed--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
the
last
one
does,
any
other
circumstance
which
extenuates
the
gravity
of
the
crime.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
even
though
it
is
not
a
legal
excuse.
now,
the
california
supreme
court
in
the
easley
case
did
indicate
that
it
felt
that
instruction
dealt
only
with
the
offense
and
not
the
offender.
however,
this
court
as
i
indicated
in
the
ramos
decision,
indicated
in
footnote
19
that
190.3
of
the
penal
code,
which
this
instruction
is
a
verbatim
statement
of
that,
does
comport
with
lockett
and
eddings
and
allows
the
jury
to
consider
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
so,
my
point
is
in
essence
that
this
court
has
already
upheld
the
validity
of
this
instruction
by
upholding
190.3
because
they
are
the
exact
same
language.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
i
think
there
are
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
i
think
as
i
understand
the
issue
before
the
court,
it
is
the
facial
validity
of
the
instruction.
now,
there
may
be
cases
where
a
prosecutor
may
go
beyond
bounds.
we're
not
saying
this
is
the
case,
but
the
issue
is
whether
the
four
corners
of
the
instruction
comport
with
the
eighth
amendment.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
i'm
saying
that
i
don't
understand
that
to
be
the
issue
before
the
court.
i
understand
the
issue
to
be
the
facial
validity
of
the
instruction
itself.
that
was
what
cert
was
granted
on.
now,
of
course
a
prosecutor
may
make
arguments
in
some
cases
that
go
beyond
the
limits
of
this
instruction.
in
addition,
in
this
case
the
prosecutor's
arguments
were
consistent
with
that
instruction.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
but
in
california
the
jury
is
instructed
that
the
arguments
of
the
prosecutor
are
not
the
law.
the
jury...
the
prosecutor
presents
his
case.
he's
saying,
the
defense
evidence
does
not
constitute
substantial
mitigation
to
determine
a
punishment
less
than
death.
the
defense
then
gets
up
and
says,
we've
put
on
all
this
evidence
of
mitigation.
it's
an
argument
between
both
sides
as
to
whether
the
evidence
is
substantial
mitigation
or
not.
it
does
not
mean
that
the
jury
is
precluded
from
considering
it.
it's
just
the
argument
of
the
prosecutor.
he's
not
saying,
you
cannot
consider
this
evidence.
he's
saying,
divorce
yourself...
first
of
all,
he
is
saying,
divorce
yourself
from
the
emotions
and
look
at
the
facts
and
the
law.
and
then
he
says,
when
you
look
at
the
facts
and
the
law,
there
is
no
mitigation
here.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
i
think
you
have
to
view
that
in
the
context,
though,
of
the
other
provisions
of
the
instruction
where
they
talk
about
the
individual.
if
"a"
through
"j"
for
example
had
been
limited
to
just
dealing
with
the
offense
itself,
it's
possible
the
jury
would
believe
that.
but
all
the
other
provisions
deal
with
the
offender
as
well
as
the
offense,
as
i
indicated,
age,
mental
defect,
duress,
things
like
that;
so
there
is
no
reason
to
suddenly
conclude
that
when
you
get
to
the
"k"
provision,
that
that's
only
limited
to
the
offense.
and
again,
i
think
that--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--i
don't
think
he
did,
your
honor.
i'm
not
quite
sure,
in
all
candor.
but
again,
i
think
that
the
issue
as
i
understand
it
is
what
the
validity
of
this
instruction
is,
and
not
if
the
prosecutor
may
have
misstated--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
but
the
question
that
was
certified...
we
filed
a
petition
for
cert,
and
as
i
understand
the
question
that
was
certified
was
question
one
of
our
petition
which
was,
whether
an
instruction
at
the
penalty
phase
on
these
issues
violates
the
eighth
amendment
where
the
defendant
has
been
permitted
unlimited
opportunity
to
present
mitigating
evidence,
and
the
instruction
merely
advised
the
tryer
of
fact
not
to
consider
matters
not
relevant
to
the
offense
or
the
offender.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
i
think
what
happens,
though,
is
the
supreme
court
of
california
viewed
the
prosecutor's
arguments
in
the
context
of
what
we
would
construe
its
misunderstanding
of
the
validity
of
the
instructions.
the
court
historically,
as
all
the
briefs
have
indicated,
has
found
that
giving
of
a
sympathy
instruction
violates
the
federal
constitution
and
previous
deferment
indicated
that
it
violated
the
state
constitution,
and
it
viewed
the
prosecutor's
arguments
in
that
context.
now,
if
this
court
were
to
adopt
our
position
and
conclude
that
the
giving
of
this
instruction
is
not
improper
in
that
it
just
tells
the
jury
to
put
aside
its
emotions
and
view
the
facts
and
law
of
the
case,
if
the
supreme
court
of
california
would
look
at
the
prosecutor's
arguments
in
that
light
it
might
reach
a
fully
different
conclusion.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
i
would
think
that
that
would
be
an
appropriate
way
to
do
it
because
again,
i
think
the
supreme
court
of
california
has
what
i
believe
is
a
misunderstanding
of
what
the
concepts
in
this
instruction
mean
versus
concepts
of
mitigation.
these
are
emotions,
which
as
i
have
indicated
the
law
of
this
court
is,
really
has
no
place
in
the
equation
of
determining
life
or
death.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
that's
true,
in
louisiana--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
again
those
arguments,
we
don't
know...
those
arguments
are
not
this
case,
obviously,
and
there
may
be
error
in
those
other
cases.
but
again,
those
cases
are
not
before
this
court,
nor
do
i
understand
it
is
the
validity
of
the
prosecutor's
arguments.
and
even
if--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
but
again--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
again
those
cases
are
not
this
case,
and
our
position
would
be
that
if
you
are
going
to
reach
the
merits
of
the
arguments
to
the
prosecutor,
that
they
are
consistent
with
what
we
are
saying
here
because
at
one
point
in
his
argument
he
tells
the
jury,
don't
consider
sympathy
for
the
victims
any
more
than
you
would
consider
sympathy
or
any
of
these
emotions
for
the
defendant.
and
at
the
beginning
of
his
argument
he
talks
about
the
fact
that,
don't
be
swayed
by
these
emotions.
you
must
consider
the
law.
and
then
he
goes
through
the
8.84.1
and
lays
them
out
one
by
one
for
the
jury.
and
of
course,
he
makes
his
argument
that
they
are
not
to...
there's
no
mitigation
as
to
these
factors
but
as
to
others.
our
point,
essentially,
here,
is
that
in
california
versus
ramos
this
court
indicated
that
within
reason
each
state
has
a
right
to
determine
what
factors
should
weigh
in
the
life
or
death
equation.
and
again,
in
skipper
versus
south
carolina,
justice
powell
in
his
concurring
opinion
noted
the
same
thing,
that
within
certain
reasonable
standards
a
state
has
a
right
to
determine
what
these
factors
should
be.
it
is
our
position
that
when
a
jury
is
allowed
to
consider
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence,
as
it
is
in
this
case,
there
is
nothing
inappropriate
about
telling
jurors
to
try
and
circumscribe
their
discretion
as
much
as
possible
and
put
aside
these
normal,
human
emotions
and
give
both
sides
a
fair
hearing
and
determine
the
case
on
the
law
and
the
facts.
again,
the
final
line
of
the
instruction
is,
"you
will
reach
a
just
verdict.
"
so,
it
tells
them
to
view
the
facts
and
the
law
and
render
a
fair
verdict
on
that
rather
than
on
emotions.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
but
again--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--we're
objecting
but--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
we're
talking
about
the
people
of
the
state
of
california.
similarly,
in
ramos
the
california
supreme
court
indicated
that
giving
the
governor's
commutation
instruction
was
inappropriate,
but
we
petitioned
for
certiorari
and
the
issue
was
whether
the
people
of
the
state
have
a
right
to
have
this
considered
as
a
factor
in
the
death
penalty
equation.
and
it
is
our
position
that--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
it
didn't
say
sympathy
for
the
defendant.
it
said,
sympathy
for
anybody.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well--
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--well,
first
of
all
as
i
indicated,
what
we
are
saying
is,
as
we
said
in
california
versus
ramos,
the
state
or
the
people
have
a
right
to
have
certain
factors
considered
in
the
death
penalty
equation.
it's...
each
state
has
a
right
to
determine
what
the
qualities
the
jury
should
consider
are.
now,
california,
this
instruction
has
existed
for
many
years
and
it
has
been
decided
that
the
jury
should
be
told
to
put
aside
their
emotions
for
anybody.
we
all
understand
that
people
when
they
are
making
a
life
or
death
determination
are
going
to
be
emotional.
you
can't
help
but
be
emotional.
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
it's
not
unreasonable
to
ask
these
jurors,
to
the
best
of
their
ability,
to
put
aside
these
emotions
and
look
at
the
facts
and
the
law
and
consider
any
factor
that's
relevant
mitigating
evidence.
for
example,
if
the
defendant
wanted
to
put
on
evidence
that
as
a
child
he
was
dropped
on
his
head
and
his
parents
beat
him
up,
that's
fine.
the
jury
may
consider
that
as
mitigating
evidence
and
it
may
evoke
some
emotions.
but,
what
we're
saying
is
that
they
should
not
decide
the
case
on
emotions
alone
but
view
the
evidence
and
determine
in
the
equation
whether
under
"k"
or
under
any
other
provision,
the
aggravating
factors
are
outweighed
by
the
mitigating.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
well,
it
says,
"you
must
not
swayed
by
mere
sentiment--
"
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
--i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
i'm
sorry.
i
don't
think
i
said
that,
but
i
may
have
misspoke
myself.
but
in
conclusion,
then,
i
think
that
what
we're
saying
here
is
that
it
is
reasonable
in
accord
with
the
ramos
decision
to
allow
the
state
to
tell
a
jury
to
put
aside
its
emotions
and
decide
a
case
fairly
on
the
facts
and
the
law,
as
this
instruction
does
do,
and
under
8.84.1,
"the
jury
may
consider
all
relevant
mitigating
evidence
relating
to
the
offense
and
the
offender.
"
for
these
reasons,
the
giving
of
the
instruction
here
was
constitutional,
and
the
decision
of
the
california
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
at
this
time
i
would
like
to
reserve
five
minutes
for
rebuttal.
mr.
jay
m.
bloom
yes,
your
honor.
thank
you.
may
it
please
the
court:
with
regard
to
the
issue
of
sympathy,
i
think
it
must
be
considered
that
at
the
penalty
phase
when
this
instruction
is
being
given,
the
defendant
has
already
presumably
been
convicted
of
murder
in
the
first
degree,
and
a
special
circumstance
of
some
sort
has
been
found.
so,
under
these
circumstances
to
believe
necessarily
that
sympathy
would
be
helpful
to
a
defendant,
i
think
is
wrong.
i
think
that
if
anything,
as
indicated
in
the
briefs,
sympathy
is
likely
to
be
engendered
the
other
way
against
the
defendant
in
favor
of
the
victim.
so,
for
this
reason
it
seems
eminently
reasonable
and
fair
to
everybody
involved
to
tell
the
jury,
put
aside
these
gut
reactions
the
best
you
can;
decide
the
case
on
the
facts
and
the
law.
now,
with
regard
to
the
prosecutor's
argument,
i
wanted
to
invite
the
court's
attention
if
i
could
to
page
6524
of
the
reporter's
transcript,
and
this
is
the
opening
of
his
argument.
he
says,
"remember,
during
the
voir
dire
i
told
you
that
the
court
would
not
leave
you
adrift
to
your
own
feelings
to
decide
which
of
the
two
punishments
should
be
imposed.
"
"the
court
would
provide
you
with
guidelines,
instructions
to
make
these
decisions,
and
indeed
this
will
happen.
"
"the
court
will
instruct
you
in
determining
the
penalty
to
be
imposed.
"
"you
shall
consider
all
the
evidence
which
has
been
received
during
any
part
of
the
trial.
"
"you
shall
consider,
take
into
account
and
be
guided
by
the
following
factors.
"
he
then
goes
through
the
various
"a"
through
"k"
factors.
so,
even
though
he
starts
out
saying,
i
want
you
to
put
aside
your
emotions
as
i
told
you,
he
then
says,
go
ahead
and
view
the
evidence,
which
is
precisely
what
he's
supposed
to
be
doing.
in
addition,
i
think
the
instruction
must
be
viewed
as
a
whole.
i
think
that
respondent's
brief
narrowed
the
court
too
much
onto
the
issue
of
sympathy.
the
other
words
are
crucial
here:
"you
must
not
be
swayed
by
mere
sentiment,
conjecture,
sympathy,
but
you
will
conscientiously
consider
and
weigh
the
evidence
and
apply
the
law
of
the
case,
and
that
you
will
reach
a
just
verdict.
"
in
other
words,
the
best
you
can,
put
everything
aside
with
regard
to
emotion,
carefully
weigh
the
facts
and
the
law,
and
render
a
just
and
fair
verdict.
we
believe
that
the
state
of
california,
consistently
with
the
ramos
decision
and
the
eighth
amendment,
may
ask
the
jury
to
render
a
just
verdict
based
on
the
facts
and
the
law,
and
for
that
reason
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
