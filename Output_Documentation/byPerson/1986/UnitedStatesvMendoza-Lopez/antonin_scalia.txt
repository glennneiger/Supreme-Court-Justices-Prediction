justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
have
conceded
that.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
it
was
fundamentally
unfair?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
want
us
in
our
decision
to
assume
it
was
fundamentally
unfair.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
does
it
mean
to
assume
that
it
is
fundamentally
unfair?
that
is
what
troubles
me.
are
you
asking
us
to
say
that
so
long
as
somebody
is
deported
no
matter
what
the
unfairness
in
the
hearing
was?
i
mean,
suppose
two
fbi
agents
just
show
up
and
say
we
are
federal
agents,
we
are
going
to
deport
you,
and
they
have
no
authority
whatever,
and
they
will
say,
we
will
give
you
a
hearing
right
now,
and
they
give
them
a
quick
hearing,
and
they
decide
they
are
going
to
deport
them.
they
take
them
to
the
border
and
deport
them.
is
that
fundamental
unfairness
embraced
in
the
kind
of
fundamental
unfairness
you
want
us
to
assume?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
amounts
to
a
deportation?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
what
if
there
was
bias
on
the
part
of
the
administrative
judge,
the
immigration
judge?
i
mean,
he
was
a
brother
of
the
worst
enemy
of
one
of
them,
and
it
was
clearly
just
a
rump
proceeding?
you
would
want
us
to
assume
that,
too?
any
kind
of
procedural
irregularity
whatever
in
the
deportation
proceeding?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
direct
appeal?
he
has
been...
if
you
assume
he
has
been
done
out
of
his
right
of
appeal
by
this
biased
judge
who
never
even
informs
him
of
his
right
of
appeal,
and
then
he
is
out
of
the
country,
there
is
really
no
way
he
can
get
the
matter
before
the
court
any
more
unless
the
attorney
general
lets
him
back
in
in
his
grace,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can
do
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
require
a
hearing
before
an
immigration
judge
of
some
sort?
justice
antonin
scalia
who
signs
an
order.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wright,
is
it
customary
for
the
service
to
allow
a
voluntary
departure
if
the
illegal
immigrant
just
says,
you
know,
you
got
me,
it
is
no
use
going
through
the
hearing?
what
do
they
usually...
because
otherwise
you
may
be
giving
away
the
store
here.
it
would
seem
to
me
to
pay
every
immigration
who
is
caught
to
say
don't
try
me,
just
let
me
go
and
i
will
depart
quietly,
and
then
he
comes
back
in
and
you
can't
apply
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see,
so
you
can
get
three
bites,
really.
that
is,
the
first
time
you
just
don't
contest
the
deportation,
say
i
will
leave
quietly,
right?
the
second
time
you
are
caught
you
do
contest
it
because
they
won't
let
you
leave
quietly
and
they
deport
you.
and
then
it
is
only
the
third
time
that
the
criminal
statute
would
apply
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
penalty
for
illegally
entering
the
united
states
unless
you
have
been
previously
deported?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
first
time
you
pick
up
an
illegal
alien
all
you
can
do
is
deport?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
would
lead
me
to
think
that
the
fbi
agent
hypothetical
would
be
covered.
i
just
don't
know
how...
you
are
willing
to
read
something
into
the
statute
but--
justice
antonin
scalia
--once
you
are
willing
to
read
something
into
it,
why
aren't
you
willing
to
read
as
much
as
the
respondent
would?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
a
lot
to
argue
about.
whether
some
other
federal
official
acting
under
color
of
law
purporting
to
be
acting
officially
puts
somebody
on
a
boat,
whether
that
is
a
deportation,
i
would
think
it
could
be
called
a
deportation.
so
you
acknowledge
that
you
are
willing
to
read
something
into
the
statute.
you
say
no,
it
is
not
anything,
it
has
to
be
pursuant
to
the
legal
formalities
before
an
immigration
law
judge,
so
you
are
not
really
as
virtuous
in
this
thing
not
reading
anything
into
the
statute
as
you
brief
makes
out.
it
is
just...
the
quarrel
is
really
over
just
how
much
you
are
going
to
read
into
it.
that
is
all.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand.
that
doesn't
mean
that
they
weren't
properly
found
to
be
illegal
aliens.
it
just
means
that
they
weren't
advised
of
the
possibility
of
their
appealing
for
a
discretionary
waiver
of
their
deportation,
right?
it
as
entirely
within
the
grace
of
the
attorney
general
whether
he
would
grant
that,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it
isn't
as
though
they
were
entitled
to
be
kept
in
the
country.
they
only
thing
that
they
weren't
told
about
was
the
possibility
of
their
asking
the
attorney
general
to
let
them
stay
in.
and
that
is
what
rendered
it
fundamentally
unfair.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
doesn't
allow
you
to
stay.
it
allows
the
attorney
general
to
allow
you
to
stay
if
he
wants
to,
doesn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
so,
i
mean,
that
is
what
i
am
having
trouble
with.
maybe
there
are
some
things
that
are
fundamentally...
that
render
a
proceeding
fundamentally
unfair.
if
something
happened
which
caused
the
judge
to
find
them
deportable
when
they
really
weren't
deportable,
that
might
be
something
else,
but
here
really
your
only
claim
is,
he
should
have
told
them
that
there
was
another
avenue
of
discretionary
relief
that
they
might
have
pursued.
maybe
he
should
have
told
them
that,
but
i
find
it
hard
to
say
that
that
renders
the
deportation
fundamentally
unfair,
and
that
is
what
you
are
arguing
here.
you
are
arguing
a
due
process
violation.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
are
arguing
that
and
the
fact
that
there
was
fundamental
unfairness.
we
wouldn't
even
have
to
reach
the
other
question
if
we
didn't
see
this
to
be
fundamental
unfairness.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
find
that
a
queer
use
of
language
to
say
that
the
ability
to
ask
for
a
favor
is
a
right.
i
mean,
you
can
call
it
you
have
a
right
to
ask
for
a
favor.
now,
if
you
want
to
call
that
a
right
you
can
call
it
a
right,
i
guess,
but
it
doesn't
sound
like
a
right
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
reversing
the
attorney
general
for
his
denial
of
relief
under
that
provision?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
was
considered
by
the
house
committee,
as
i
recall,
to
be
the
predecessor
of
it
because
in
explaining
to
the
full...
i
think
it
was
the
house,
the
full
house
what
the
changes
being
made
were.
they
published
that
statute
next
to
the
new
provision,
so
that
committee
at
least
thought
that
this
was
the
one
that
the
new
provision
was
replacing.
