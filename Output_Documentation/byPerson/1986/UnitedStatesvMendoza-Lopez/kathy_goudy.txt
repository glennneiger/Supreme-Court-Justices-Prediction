ms.
kathy
goudy
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
am
here
to
argue
that
a
deportation
order
which
has
not
been
previously
reviewed
in
a
judicial
forum
in
any
way
can
be
looked
at
by
a
court
before
it
becomes
the
predicate
for
a
criminal
conviction.
such
a
review
is
permitted
by
the
legislative
history
of
section
1326,
the
reentry
after
deportation
statute,
and
it
is
also
commensurate
with
the
overall
purpose
of
the
immigration
and
nationalization
act.
it
is
important
to
allow
some
procedure
or
format
for
such
a
review
to
determine
whether
the
prior
adjudication
was
after
a
full
and
adequate
hearing.
it
is
important
to
ensure
that
no
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
occurred
in
that
administrative
hearing.
and
the
only
way
to
ensure
that
is
to
allow
some
examination
of
whether
the
applicable
constitutional,
statutory,
and
regulatory
procedures
were
followed
by
the
administrative
judge.
ms.
kathy
goudy
in
this
particular
case
their
rights
of
appeal
ended
within
48
hours
after
the
hearing.
the
district--
ms.
kathy
goudy
--there
was
a
waiver
during
the
hearing.
in
this
case
the
facts
are
pretty
much
intermeshed
with
the
loss
of
their
due
process
rights.
the
transcript
which
was
provided
the
judge
was
unofficial.
however,
the
tapes
have
been
stipulated
in
of
that
hearing.
when
you
listen
to
them
you
will
hear
that
it
is
not
like
they
are
having
the
same
conversation
at
all.
the
judge
is
saying
one
thing,
the
people
are
asking
about
bond.
they
are
not
following
up
on
their
questions
when
they
try
to
enforce
their
rights.
they
don't--
ms.
kathy
goudy
--in
this
case
it
was
found
to
be.
ms.
kathy
goudy
when
it
goes
to
the
extreme
it
did
in
this
case,
yes.
ms.
kathy
goudy
the
have
a
right
to
collaterally
attack
to
determine
if
it
was
a
serious
violation
of
due
process.
ms.
kathy
goudy
yes.
ms.
kathy
goudy
that
was
one
of
the
findings
of
the
court
in
the
main
findings
of
a
due
process
violation
because
of
the
serious
harm
that
fell
from
that.
they
should
not
have
been
placed
over
the
border
if--
ms.
kathy
goudy
--there
is
some
language
in
the
opinion
that
the
right
to
appeal
kind
of
got
meshed
in
with
the
rest
of
the
conversation
that
was
going
on.
they
did
waive
their
right
to
appeal.
ms.
kathy
goudy
and
when
they
were
placed
across
the
border,
any
future
right
to
appeal
ended
at
that
point
under
section
1105(a).
ms.
kathy
goudy
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
because
of
the
harm
that
was
suffered
by
their
failure
to
follow
up
on
that
suspension,
yes,
because
they
were...
there
is
no
further
right
to
appeal
that
deportation.
to
reenter
the
country
they
would
have
to
get
a
visa.
they
lost
their
meaningful
time,
what
was
it,
seven
years,
to
get
the
suspension
of
deportation.
under
the
new
act
they
lost
their
chance
for
amnesty
for
the
five
years.
because
of
the
severity
of
the
harm
that
occurred,
yes,
i
do
feel
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
occurred
in
their
deportation
hearing.
what
was
filed
in
the
district
court
was
a
request
for
a
procedural
review
of
some
sort
of
the
actual
deportation
hearing.
it
was
called
alternatively
a
request
for
collateral
attack,
permission
to
bring
up
a
collateral
attack
at
the
jury
trial,
and
also
a
motion
to
suppress,
in
pursuant
to
federal
rules
of
criminal
procedure
12b.
the
thrust
behind
it
was
that
it
is
impossible
to
learn
if
there
is
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
unless
there
is
some
forum
established
to
look
at
the
facts,
and
that
the
criminal
conviction
must
rest
upon
a
lawful
and
adequate
deportation
order.
the
deportation
in
this
order
was
found
by
the
court
to
be
unreliable.
the
immigration
judge
had
acknowledged
their
eligibility
for
suspension
of
deportation
and
failed
to
act
on
their
request.
statute--
ms.
kathy
goudy
--yes,
the
attorney
general
acting,
too,
as
agent
of
the
immigration
service,
yes.
ms.
kathy
goudy
not
necessarily
entitled.
however,
congress
has
put
in
the
suspension
of
deportation
statute.
it
is
a
law
that
allows
you
if
you
have
been
here
seven
years,
even
though
you
entered
illegally,
to
remain
here
if
you
show
you
have
been
of
good
moral
character
and
that
it
would
cause
severe
harm
to--
ms.
kathy
goudy
--if
the
application
were
processed,
that
is
correct.
ms.
kathy
goudy
i
am
arguing
that
the
district
court
should
be
allowed
to
review
the
facts
of
the
deportation
to
see
if
there
is
a
fundamental
fairness.
i
am
arguing
whether
they
should
be
allowed
to
go
back
and
look
at
the
deportation
at
all.
ms.
kathy
goudy
right,
the
fundamental
unfairness
was
found
to
be
severe
in
that
they
wouldn't
have
gone
across
the
border
if
they
had
been
allowed
to
apply
for
the
discretionary
relief.
if
they
wouldn't
have
gone
across
the
border
an
appeal
could
have
been
filed
under
1105(a)
under
any
of
the
formats
available
there.
if
they
wouldn't
have
gone
across
the
border,
they
might
have
their
green
cards
today
and
be
legal
residents
of
the
united
states.
and
that
was
the
substantial
harm
that
was
found
that
made
that
fundamentally
unfair.
they
were
told
they
had
a
right
when
they
tried
to
ask
questions
in
this
mass
hearing
where
there
were
12
other
defendants.
their
questions
weren't
answered.
ms.
kathy
goudy
suspension
of
deportation
is...
it
is
a
discretionary
relief
available
if
you
can
bring
your
evidence
in
sufficiently,
but
it
is
not
a
favor.
if
there
is
enough
substantial
harm
to
an
american
citizen
that
is
a
relative
to
you,
and
if
you
have
met
jumped
through
all
the
hoops
necessary,
it
is
something
that
they
should
discretionarily
give
you.
it
is
something
you
have
earned
by
seven
years
of
good
moral
character
in
the
united
states,
regardless--
ms.
kathy
goudy
--it
is
considered
discretionary.
they
are
very
hard...
they
would
be
very
hard
to
win
it.
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
the
government's
position
appears
to
be
that
section
1326
should
be
read
as
not
reading
in
the
word
"lawful"
into
the
word
"deportation".
the
language
of
1326
when
it
uses
the
word
"deportation"
is
ambiguous
on
its
face.
deportation
as
defined
in
1252
means
a
lot
of
different
things.
deportation
is
the
order
to
show
case
you
are
served
with.
deportation
is
the
hearing
you
have
in
front
of
the
judge
in
which
suspension
of
deportation
is
a
secondary
part.
deportation
is
the
warrant
that
is
signed
after
the
hearing,
and
deportation
is
when
you
are
finally
placed
across
the
border.
it
is
entirely
conceivable
and
happens
in
many
cases
that
a
person
is
deported
and
still
here
in
the
united
states
for
many
years
on
appeal
of
that
deportation
order.
the
legislative
history
of
section
1326
offers
little
credence
to
the
government's
position
that
congress
intended
to
allow
any
deportation,
even
an
unlawful
deportation,
to
be
reviewed
for
its
factual
basis.
ms.
kathy
goudy
it
is
not
a
complete
explanation.
ms.
kathy
goudy
the
government's
isn't.
the
complete
explanation
would
be
that
there
were
about
four
statutes
all
involving
some
form
of
criminal
penalty
for
reentry
after
deportation.
there
was
one
for
reentry
of
radicals,
one
for
reentry
of
prostitutes,
one
for
reentry
of
procurers,
and
one
for
kind
of
a
general
reentry
statute.
and
they
all
got
merged.
there
was
a
1950
senate
report
which
was
about
the
only
discussion
on
this
statute
that
is
available
in
the
legislative
history,
and
in
that--
ms.
kathy
goudy
--for
one
thing,
the
statute
that
had
1326.
it
is
not
as
if
three
words
were
extracted
and
the
statutes
match
otherwise.
ms.
kathy
goudy
and
the
other
statutes
just
sort
of
disappeared.
there
is
an
earlier
report
where
they
agreed
to
merge
it
in
the
senate,
the
four
statutes,
just
to
make
it
a
more
cohesive
and
enforceable
act
of
law.
also,
the
"in
pursuance
of
law";
all
of
them
use
different
languages.
furthermore,
the
"in
pursuance
of
law"
was
not
deleted.
it
got
moved
to
section
1101(g),
which
also
has
some
explanatory
explanation
about
whether
or
not
you
are
deported
if
you
pay
to
go
across
the
border
or
if
the
government
pays
your
way
across.
ms.
kathy
goudy
it
wasn't
formerly
1326.
the
reading
of
the
statute
doesn't
match
at
all.
the
language
is
inapplicable...
it
it
not
inapplicable.
the
sense
is
the
same
in
the
section,
but
the
language
is
so
completely
different.
there
were
a
lot
of
words
that
were
deleted
from
there.
there
also
is
absolutely
no
legislative
history
of
any
kind
to
make
it...
to
show
that
congress
explicitly
meant
to
block
any
form
of
collateral
attack,
and
because
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
an
explicit
intent
to
take
away
an
individual's
right
has
to
be
found
in
the
legislative
history
before
it
can
be
interpreted.
ms.
kathy
goudy
i
am
referring
in
general
to
the
rule
of
lenity.
i
could
obtain
a
case
and
submit
it
later
if
you
wish.
ms.
kathy
goudy
no,
that
is
not
what
i
meant.
what
i
meant
was,
is
that
if
you
are
going
to
read
negative
connotations
into
a
statute,
there
has
to
be
some
intent
of
congress
to
show
that
those
individual
rights
that
are
going
to
be
taken
away,
the
right
to
have
some
form
of
judicial
review
before
being
placed
in
jail,
has
to
exist.
if
there
is
question
in
how
you
can
interpret
a
statute
and
it
can't
be
resolved
by
looking
at
the
legislative
history,
it
should
be
resolved
in
favor
of
the
defendants.
i
would
also...
in
conclusion
what
i
want
to
state
then
is
that
what
we
asked
for
and
was
granted
was
some
forum,
some
access
to
bring
this
hearing
to
the
attention
of
a
job,
because
how
are
you
going
to
know
if
there
was
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
unless
you
give
a
person
some
access
in
to
have
it
reviewed?
a
right
with
no
enforcement
provision
into
it
is
illusory.
thank
you.
