mr.
wright,
if
the
deportation
had
been
at
gunpoint
you
would
still
be
making
the
same
argument,
wouldn't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
after
a
proceeding?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
anyway
the
statute
says
how
you
deport
somebody,
doesn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
they
have
the
force
of
law,
i
suppose,
or
what?
so
you
have
to
have
an
immigration
judge
and
he
has
to
sign
a
piece
of
paper.
does
he
have
to
act
in
accordance
with
the
outlined
procedure?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
he
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
you
haven't
followed
the
procedures
that
the
statute
or
the
regulations
say
lead
to
a
valid
deportation,
it
isn't
a
deportation.
