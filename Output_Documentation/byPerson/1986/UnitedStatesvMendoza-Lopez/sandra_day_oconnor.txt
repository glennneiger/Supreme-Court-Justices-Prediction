mr.
wright,
what
would
have
happened
if
one
of
them
had
said,
yes,
i
think
i
would
like
to
appeal?
would
they
be
deported
nonetheless?
or
would
they
remain
here
pending
the
appeal?
or
what
happens?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
the
person
might
have
to
remain
in
custody
pending
the
appeal?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
you
wouldn't
think
that
even
a
so-called
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
in
the
course
of
a
1326
proceeding
could
be
raised?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
if
the
right
to
appeal
was
not
known
by
the
person
deported
and
therefore
the
waiver
of
the
appeal
was
invalid?
that
can't
be
raised?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
there
are
absolutely
no
due
process
limitations
to
the
enforcement
of
section
1326?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
wasn't
there
a
waiver,
though?
what
has
that
got
to
do
with
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
thought
we
took
this
case
on
the
assumption
that
the
defect
below
was
in
the
failure
to
adequately
explain
the
possibility
of
suspension
by
the
attorney
general
of
the
deportation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
was
my
understanding
that
their
right
to
appeal
had
been
explained,
and
that
no
appeal
was
taken
by
those
deported,
by
the
respondents
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
failure
to
explain
the
right
of...
the
possibility
of
suspension
rises
to
the
level
of
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
as
that
term
has
been
applied
by
this
court
in
earlier
cases?
