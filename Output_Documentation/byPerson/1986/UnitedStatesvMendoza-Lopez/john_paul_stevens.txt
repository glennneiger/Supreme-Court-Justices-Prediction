is
it
if
it
is
so...
i
mean,
maybe
we
are
playing
on
words.
say
it
is
so
terribly
unfair,
say
the
judge
is
biased
and
he
doesn't
let
any
witnesses
come
in,
and
when
he
enters
the
order
he
pulls
out
a
gun
and
takes
the
man
across
the
border
himself,
so
could
it
be
so
bad
that
it
would
be
void,
and
therefore
not
a
deportation?
when
is
it
a
deportation
and
when
it
is
not?
i
guess
that
is
the
issue.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
preserve
that,
then
you
have
to
ask
the
question
whether
this
was
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice,
and
i
think
you
don't
want
us
to
even
be
asking
that.
well,
i
am
happy
if
you
wanted
to
consider
that,
because
clearly
this
was
not
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice.
but
you
know,
you
just
change
the
facts
a
little,
you
didn't
tell
them
about
appeal,
they
didn't
have
a
translator
there.
i
mean,
you
can
gradually
move
along
the
line,
and
do
you
get
to
a
point
where
you
might
say
that,
well,
this
one
is
so
bad
we
would
admit
it
is
"void"
or
it
is
not
a
"deportation"
because
it
was
so
bad.
i
am
not
quite
sure
what
your--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
really
clean
rule
even
covers
the
fbi
agents
case.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
an
official
of
the
government
said
i
am
hereby
deporting
you,
and
i
am
signing
a
piece
of
paper
that
says
you
are
deported,
and
then
he
takes
him
across.
why
isn't
that
a
deportation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
procedure
must
be
regular
on
its
face
or
something
like
that?
the
procedure
must
be
regular
on
its
face?
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand
one
thing.
if
he
does
grant
voluntary
departure,
and
the
alien
returns
without
permission,
he
has
not
violated
1326?
justice
john
paul
stevens
he
hasn't
been
deported.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
imagine
there
are
some
people
if
you
asked
them
whether
an
fbi
agent
points
a
gun
at
you
and
hauls
you
across
the
border,
have
you
been
deported,
i
think
some
people
might
say
yes.
