mr.
christopher
j.
wright
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
presented
is
whether
defendants
prosecuted
under
8
usc
1326
for
reentering
the
united
states
following
a
deportation
may
collaterally
attack
the
deportation
proceeding
in
the
criminal
prosecution.
the
two
respondents
were
arrested
by
agents
of
the
immigration
and
naturalization
service
in
october,
1984,
in
nebraska.
at
an
immigration
hearing
in
denver
with
eleven
other
aliens
they
were
given
a
list
of
free
legal
services
and
advised
that
the
proceeding
could
be
delayed
if
they
wished
to
contact
counsel.
they
waived
their
right
to
counsel.
the
immigration
judge
questioned
each
alien
at
the
hearing.
respondents
both
admitted
that
they
were
citizens
of
mexico,
that
they
had
entered
the
united
states
unlawfully,
and
that
they
were
subject
to
deportation.
the
immigration
judge
advised
both
respondents
that
they
were
eligible
to
apply
for
suspension
of
deportation
because
they
had
been
in
this
country
more
than
seven
years.
the
judge
explained
that
to
qualify
for
suspension
of
deportation
an
applicant
must
show
that
he
is
of
good
moral
character
and
that
severe
harm
would
be
suffered
by
a
member
of
the
applicant's
immediate
family
if
he
were
deported.
the
judge
also
stated
that
the
respondents
could
have
five
days
to
apply
for
suspension
of
deportation.
both
respondents
decided
not
to
apply
for
suspension
of
deportation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
suspension
of
deportation
is
discretionary
matter.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
he
does,
most
commonly
if
indeed
a
spouse
of
the
alien
is
an
american
citizen.
the
immigration
judge
ordered
that
both
respondents
be
deported.
he
asked
whether
they
wanted
to
appeal
his
order,
whether
they
wanted
to
accept
his
order,
or
whether
they
wanted
to
reserve
decision.
respondents
both
accepted
the
order
and
waved
their
right
to
appeal.
they
were
deported
to
mexico
two
days
later.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
they
would
remain
here
pending
appeal.
one
of
the
respondents
asked
whether
or
not
they
would
be
released
on
bond
pending
the
appeal,
and
was
told
that
there
would
have
to
be
a
proceeding
to
determine
what
the
amount
of
the
bond
should
be.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
both
did.
six
weeks
later,
however,
both
were
arrested
in
lincoln,
nebraska.
they
were
charged
under
section
1326.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
from
el
paso,
texas,
into
mexico.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
respondents
sought
to
dismiss
the
indictments,
contending
that
their
deportation
proceeding
had
been
conducted
unlawfully.
the
district
court
first
considered
whether
respondents
could
collaterally
attack
their
deportation
proceeding,
noting
that
the
circuits
are
split
on
the
issue
and
that
this
court
has
not
decided
the
question.
it
decided
that
collateral
attack
is
permitted
at
least
to
the
extent
that
the
court
could
review
the
deportation
proceeding
prior
to
trial.
the
district
court
then
concluded
that
while
the
immigration
judge
had
complied
with
the
regulation
requiring
that
he
inform
respondents
that
they
were
eligible
to
apply
for
suspension
of
deportation,
that
respondents
were
not
in
a
position
to
evaluate
intelligently
that
option.
the
court
also
found
that
respondent's
decisions
not
to
appeal
were
not
considered
judgments.
on
that
basis,
it
concluded
that
the
hearing
was
fundamentally
unfair
and
dismissed
the
indictments.
a
divided
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
it
was.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
have.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
have
not
raised...
i
am
sorry,
we
haven't
conceded,
we
have
not
raised
the
issue
before
this
court
whether
the
hearing
was
conducted
properly.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals
sided
with
those
circuits
that
hold
"that
a
material
element
of
the
offense
prohibited
by
section
1326
is
a
lawful
deportation.
"
the
court
found
that
this
court's
decision
in
lewis,
where
the
court
held
that
a
defendant
prosecuted
for
being
a
felon
in
possession
of
a
firearm
may
not
collaterally
attack
their
felony
convictions
is
not
analogous.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--no,
in
that
case
the
elements
of
the
crime
prohibited
by
section
1326
are
reentry
after
a
deportation.
your
facts
do
not
amount
to
a
deportation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
you
have
to
go
before
an
immigration
judge,
who
signs
an
order
of
deportation
ordering
you
to
be
deported.
you
can
always
say
in
a
prosecution
under
section
1326
that
i
wasn't
deported.
an
element
of
the
crime
is
that
you
are
deported.
we
are
conceding
that
the
deportation
hearing
was
conducted
improperly,
the
specific
impropriety
found
here
was
that
suspension
of
deportation
was
not
adequately
explained
to
the
two
respondents.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
is
our
position
that
the
alien's
options
are
to
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
and
then
to
the
court
of
appeals
or
failing
that,
that
they
can
apply
to
the
attorney
general
for
permission
to
reenter
the
united
states
following
a
deportation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
correct.
it
is
our
position
that
it
can't
be
raised
there,
that
the
correct
approach
is
to
raise
it
on
appeal
or
to
apply
for
permission
to
reenter.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
of
course
that
could
be
appealed,
raised
on
appeal
to
the
board
of
immigration
appeals.
now,
your
particular
example,
of
course,
the
alien
wouldn't
raise
it
because
the
hypothetical
is
that
they
weren't
told
of
that.
it
is
our
position
that
the
alien
may
still
not
take
the
self-help
remedy
of
re-entry,
that
the
proper
course
is
to
apply
for
permission
to
reenter,
and
if
the
alien
has
an
argument
that
would
justify
suspension
of
deportation,
for
example,
he
would
have
an
argument
that
would
justify
permission
to
reenter,
and
that
is
the
proper
course.
self-help--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--that's
correct.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
don't
think
these
should
be
raised
in
1326.
these
sorts
of
terrible
hypotheticals
we
would
think
would
be
good
reason
for
a
court
of
appeals
to
reopen
the
deportation
proceeding
and
order
that
a
new
proceeding
be
held.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
certainly
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
one
would
hope
would
do
it
before
a
court
of
appeals
did
it
on
the
direct
appeal.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
it
is
more
difficult
to
appeal
from
a
foreign
country.
it
is
not
impossible.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
the
case
of
mendez
cited
in
our
brief
is
an
example
where
an
alien
did
that
and
we
would
think
that
in
these
sort
of
terrible
hypothetical
situations
that
the
proceeding
ought
to
be
reopened,
but
that
is
what
we
think
the
course
ought
to
be,
that
the
deportation
proceeding
ought
to
be
reopened
on
appeal,
or
that
permission
to
reenter
should
be
sought
from
the
attorney
general,
but
that
it
shouldn't
be
raised
following
reentry
in
a
criminal
prosecution
for
unlawful
reentry.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that
is
correct.
the
logic
of
our
position,
as
i
think
the
questions
have
brought
out,
is
that
collateral
attack
simply
isn't
authorized
in
prosecutions
under
section
1326,
however.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
am
not
sure
whether
you
would
have
a
deportation
at
gunpoint.
that
would
be
the
same
sort
of...
if
somebody
just
throws
you
across
the
border,
that
is
not
a
deportation.
that
can
be
raised.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
again,
who
signs
an
order
of
deportation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
is
a
deportation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
would...
well,
i
don't
really
think...
that
is
certainly
not
the
issue
here.
if
the
court
wanted
to
preserve
a
gross
miscarriage
of
justice
exception
as
courts
did
before
1952,
that
certainly
could
be
done.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
wouldn't
get
to
that
point,
and
i
think
the
virtues
of
a
clean
rule
that
you
can't
reenter
and
you
can't
raise
the
issue
on
reentry
have
those
obvious
virtues.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
no,
because
that
is
not
a
deportation.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
think
a
deportation
order
has
to
have
some
meaning
and
must
be
signed
by
an
immigration--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
think
there
has
to
be
a
deportation
order
signed
by
an
immigration
judge.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
i
will
settle
for...
well,
there
certainly
ought
to
be
a
proceeding.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
there
are
certainly
regulations
that
cover
that
in
some
detail.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
of
course
he
does,
and
of
course
if
he
doesn't--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--if
he
doesn't,
then
you
should
appeal
and
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
should
correct
the
error,
and
if
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
doesn't
correct
the
error,
the
court
of
appeals
should.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
that
brings
us
to
the
question
of
whether
section
1326
has
anything
to
do
with
valid
deportation.
and
it
is
our
position
that
the
language
of
the
statute
on
its
face
says
nothing
about
the
lawfulness
or
the
validity
of
the
deportation.
it
simply
says
a
deportation.
we
think
that
the
absence
of
any
requirement
on
the
face
of
section
1326
supports
our
argument,
that
is,
the
fact
of
the
deportation
and
not
its
reliability
that
congress
intends
to
be
at
issue
in
a
prosecution
under
section
1326.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
that
is
not
a
deportation.
indeed,
an
alien
who
is
granted
voluntary
departure
after
being
brought
before
an
immigration
judge
has
not
been
deported
and
is
not--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--followed
by
the
government
actually
removing
you
from
the
country.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that
hasn't
been
raised
here.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
the
trial
judge
here
only
found
that
the
suspension
of
deportation
rules
were
not
adequately
explained.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes,
that
is
the
issue,
whether--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--right,
although
we
did
not
raise
that
issue
in
our
petition.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
is
still
there.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
yes.
well,
the
alien
has
to
prove
that
he
has
either
money
or
a
ticket
to
leave
the
country.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
an
immigration
judge
won't
allow
voluntary
departure
unless
that
requirement
is
met.
and
the
immigration
judge
won't
allow
it
if
the
alien
has
done
that
before.
in
this
case,
for
instance,
there
were
13
aliens.
two
of
them
asked
for
voluntary
departure.
one
was
granted.
one
was
denied
because
he
had
been
granted
voluntary
departure
before,
and
while
he
had
ultimately
left,
he
had
only
done
it
after
he
had
been
sent
about
five
letters
saying
your
time
has
run
out.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
under
those
facts
that
is
right
i
is
not
absolutely
clear
that
an
immigration
judge
would
grant
you
voluntary
departure
the
second
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
that's
right.
he
hasn't
been
deported.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
we
think
that
section
1326
is
analogous
to
the
federal
statute
at
issue
in
lewis
and
the
federal
statute
that
prohibits
escape
from
federal
custody.
in
both
of
those
cases
it
is
the
fact
of
the
prior
proceeding
and
not
its
reliability
that
is
at
issue
in
the
prosecution
either
for
possession
of
a
firearm
or
for
escape
from
federal
custody,
and
the
courts
all
agree
that
collateral
attacks
are
not
allowed
in
those
circumstances.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
no,
that
is
what
almost
always
happens.
eight
usc
1325
makes
it
a
misdemeanor
to
enter
the
united
states
unlawfully.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
and
we
think
there
is
no
question
but
that
congress
can
prohibit
unlawful
entry
as
it
has.
accordingly
it
seems
to
make
it
even
more
clear
that
congress
can
make
criminal
entry
into
the
united
states
under
certain
circumstances,
and
that
is
all
that
congress
has
done
here.
it
has
made
criminal...
it
has
made
unlawful
entry
following
a
deportation
a
felony
subject
to
two
years
imprisonment.
it
seems
plain
to
that
congress
could
make
it
unlawful
to
enter
the
united
states
and
subject
to
a
felony
prosecution
if
you
had
polio.
that
is
really
all
we
think
that
congress
has
done
here.
the
legislative
history
of
section
1326
makes
it
even
more
clear
that
it
is
the
fact
of
the
deportation
and
not
its
reliability
that
is
at
issue.
the
predecessor
statute
contained
the
phrase
"in
pursuance
of
the
law".
when
congress
enacted
section
1326
in
1952,
it
deleted
that
phrase
from
the
statute.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
am
sorry,
i
am--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--i
am
willing
to
read
content
into
deportation,
reentry
into
the
united
states
following
a
deportation.
certainly
if
i
grabbed
someone
and
threw
him
out
of
the
country,
that
is
not
a
deportation,
and
it
seems
to
me
pretty
simple
to
agree
that
an
immigration
judge
ordering
someone
to
be
deported
following
by
an
actual
deportation
is
a
deportation,
and
that
there
is
really
not
much
to
argue
about
on
that.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
well,
i
guess
we
give
some
content
to
the
term
deportation.
we
don't
think
that
it
has
to
be
a
lawful
deportation
beyond
those
very
simple
requirements
that
i
have
stressed.
i
wish
i
had
said
that
in
the
brief.
i
mentioned
the
fact
that
congress
deleted
the
phrase
1952.
the
aclu
filed
an
amicus
brief
contending
that
although
congress
deleted
that
phrase
it
wanted
to
carry
forward
case
law
authorizing
collateral
attack.
we
showed
in
our
reply
brief
that
there
was
no
such
body
of
case
law,
but
even
if
there
were,
deleting
the
language
on
which
collateral
attack
would
be
based
seems
a
most
peculiar
way
to
signal
any
intention
to
carry
forward
such
a
rule.
the
contrary
conclusion,
that
congress
wanted
to
make
clear
that
collateral
attacks
were
not
allowed,
seems
to
me
to
be
a
much
more
reasonable
reading
of
congress's
action.
the
dissenting
judge
in
the
court
of
appeals
and
the
second
circuit
in
its
opinion
in
potrella
noted
that
section
1105(a)
makes
it
especially
clear
that
collateral
attack
is
not
authorized.
none
of
the
courts
of
appeals
that
have
allowed
collateral
attack
have
considered
this
provision.
it
was
not
clear
under
the
1952
act
whether
deportations
order
could
be
appealed.
this
court
held
in
1955
that
review
was
provided
in
the
courts
of
appeals
under
the
administrative
procedure
act.
the
lower
courts
approved
other
avenues
for
judicial
review
as
well.
congress
responded
in
1961
by
enacting
section
1105(a),
which
provides
that
appeal
from
the
board
of
immigration
appeals
to
the
courts
of
appeals
is
the
"sole
and
exclusive
procedure"
for
obtaining
judicial
review.
that
is
an
extraordinarily
clear
statement
of
congress's
intent.
and
it
ought
to
be
given
force
here.
furthermore,
congress
provided
two
exceptions
to
its
rule
that
appeal
from
the
board
to
the
courts
of
appeals
is
the
sole
and
exclusive
procedure,
and
one
of
those
exceptions,
section
1105(a)(a)(6),
which
provides
for
pretrial
review
and
criminal
prosecutions
for
failure
to
depart
from
the
united
states
following
an
order
of
deportation
makes
it
clear
that
congress
was
thinking
about
collateral
attack
in
criminal
prosecutions
when
it
enacted
section
1105(a)
and
that
it
recognized
that
absent
an
exception
section
1105(a)
would
bar
collateral
attack
on
deportation
proceedings
in
criminal
prosecutions.
but
congress
made
no
exception
for
prosecutions
under
section
1326.
therefore
we
think
there
is
no
such
exception.
i
would
like
to
note
briefly
that
we
don't
think
that
there
is
any
reason
to
construe
section
1326
contrary
to
its
plain
language
and
the
language
of
section
1105(a)
to
avoid
a
serious
constitutional
question.
we
think
that
those
concerns
were
put
to
rest
in
lewis,
where
the
court
said
that
congress
could
constitutionally
focus
on
the
fact
of
a
prior
proceeding
and
not
its
validity
in
denying
a
right
to
collateral
attack.
this
case
is
not
meaningfully
different
from
lewis
because
the
prior
proceeding
was
administrative.
collateral
attack
is
only
useful
when
the
prior
proceeding
is
flawed
in
some
way,
and
a
flawed
judicial
proceeding
is
no
better
than
a
flawed
administrative
proceeding,
we
don't
think.
in
short,
the
respondents
were
deported
and
pulled
when
they
were...
first
they
were
given
the
right
to
appeal
and
they
waived
that
right.
they
were
then
given
a
form
at
the
border
telling
them
that
they
couldn't
reenter
the
united
states
without
obtaining
the
attorney
general's
permission,
and
that
they
would
be
subject
to
a
felony
prosecution
if
they
did
return.
we
don't
think
that
there
is
anything
unfair
about
denying
them
the...
about
saying
that
they
waived
the
right
to
appeal
by
waiving.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
it
certainly
was
deleted
from
what
was
formerly
1326.
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
thank
you.
i
would
like
to
make
two
points.
one
is
that
the
immigration
judge
here
clearly
explained
to
respondents
that
they
had
the
right
to
appeal
or
to
accept
his
ruling
or
to
reserve
judgment.
the
district
court
said
that
he
thought
to
choose
not
to
appeal
was
not
a
considered
judgment,
but
the
tape
of
the
proceeding
clearly
shows
that
this
was
more
than
adequately
explained.
i
would
also
like
to
make
the
point
that
under
the
statute
at
issue
in
lewis,
a
person
would
not
be
convicted
of
a
crime
if
four
fbi
agents
hauled
him
into
a
barn
and
held
a
trial,
and
everyone
would
agree
that
that
is
not
a
conviction.
the
analogous
sort
of
deportation--
mr.
christopher
j.
wright
--we
wouldn't.
thank
you.
