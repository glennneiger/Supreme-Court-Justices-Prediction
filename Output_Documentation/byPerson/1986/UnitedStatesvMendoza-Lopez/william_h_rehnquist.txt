chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
next
in
no.
85-2067,
united
states
versus
jose
mendoza-lopez
and
angel
landeros-quinones.
mr.
wright,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
where
had
they
been
deported?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
from
el
paso.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wright,
there
is
certainly
some
authority
that
at
least
when
you
are
talking
about
a
district
court
judge,
which
i
take
it
is
every
bit
as
sacrosanct
as
an
immigration
officer
judgment,
that
if
you
would
find
actual
bias
on
the
part
of
the
judge,
that
could
be
set
aside
after
the
judgment
has
become
final.
would
you
include
these
within
the
rubric
of
what
you
are
talking
about?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
as
i
understand
the
court
of
appeals
opinion
it
was
not
based
really
on
the
finding
that
there
were
due
process
violations
in
the
hearing.
they
simply
said
you
can
collaterally
attack
this,
and
then
went
on
to
say,
we
think
the
collateral
attack
should
be
sustained
here.
they
didn't
base
it
on
any
extreme
denial
of
due
process
in
the
hearing.
they
just
say
you
can
collaterally
attack
it
for
any
number
of
reasons.
isn't
that
correct?
that's
correct,
and
while
the
district
court
said
fundamentally
unfair
here,
the
irregularity
that
he
identified
was
failure
to
explain
adequately
the
requirements
of
suspension
of
deportation.
yes,
and
really
that
is
all
we
have
to
decide
here
is
whether
on
these
facts
that
can
be
collaterally
attacked.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
an
immigration
officer
simply
picks
up
several
illegal
aliens
in
one
of
these
sweeps
or
raids
that
they
conduct
occasionally
and
simply
takes
that
person
with
that
person's
consent
to
tlajuana
or
wherever
else
on
the
border.
is
that
a
deportation?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
the
deportation
connotes
a
formal
order
directing
you
to
leave
the
country.
is
that
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
ms.
goudy.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
government
says
that
clients
like
yours
have
an
adequate
opportunity
to
make
that
sort
of
a
challenge
if
they
just
appeal
from
the
order
of
the
board
or
the
immigration
officer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
that
denial
of
due
process
to
misunderstand
the
conversation
between
a
judge
and
a
litigant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
do
you
say
it
is
in
this
court?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
even
though
they
are
given
a
right
to
appeal,
you
say
they
have
still
got
to
have
this
right
to
collaterally
attack.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
they
had
the...
they
could
have
done
that
by
appeal.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
your
response,
ms.
goudy,
to
the
government's
argument
that
congress
took
out
the
word
1326,
modifying
the
word
"deportation"?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yours
isn't
or
theirs
isn't?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
do
you
need
legislative
history
to
tell
you
what
it
means
when
the
statute
at
one
time
reads
"deportation
in
pursuance
of
law"
and
then
when
congress
gets
through
amending
it
it
no
longer
reads
"in
pursuance
of
law"?
i
would
think
that
meaning
is
pretty
clear
without
any
legislative
history.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
case
of
ours
do
you
rely
on
for
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
this
is
a
part
of
the
rule
of
lenity
that
if
congress
is
going
to
make
a
criminal
statute
more
severe
that
it
previously
had,
it
has
to
explicitly
find
that
it
it
taking
away
something
from
a
defendant
or
explicitly
say
so?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
goudy.
mr.
wright,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wright.
the
case
is
submitted.
