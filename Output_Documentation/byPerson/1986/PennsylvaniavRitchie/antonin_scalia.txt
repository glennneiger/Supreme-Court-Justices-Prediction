justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
might
if
we
thought
that
that
was
a
basis
for
saying
that
the
case
is
moot,
that
we
now
have
a
new
statute
in
front
of
us.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
don't
you
tell
us
why
it
wouldn't
be.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
basic
change
in
the
statute
as
i
understand
it
is
that
henceforth
the
prosecutor
has
access.
under
the
prior
version
even
the
prosecutor
didn't
have
access
to
it.
now
he
has
access,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
sure,
you
can
get
further
review.
the
state
can
refuse
on-remand
to
turn
over
these
records
as
the
supreme
court
has
said
it
must
do,
whereupon
either
the
conviction
will
be
set
aside
and
we
would
have
a
final
appealable
matter,
or
some
contempt
sanction
would
be
imposed
upon
the
prosecutor
or
whoever
is
in
custody
of
those
records,
and
pennsylvania
would
then
be
able
to
decide
this
question
again,
i
presume.
i
mean,
what
do
you
with
united
states
versus
ryan,
that
whole
line
of
cases?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
an
interesting
difference,
but
does
it
bear
upon
whether
the
decision
is
final
or
not?
in
ryan
you
had
an
individual
who
refused
to
turn
over
records.
the
district
court
said
you
must
turn
them
over.
the
court
of
appeals
said,
yes,
you
must.
and
we
said
that
the
court
of
appeals
should
not
have
even
entertained
the
batter
because
it
was
not
final
until
he
steadfastly
refused
to
turn
them
over
and
was
held
in
contempt.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
why
was
that
not
final
and
yet
this
is
final?
justice
antonin
scalia
have
they
been
given
to
the
attorney
for
the
other
side?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
then,
they
haven't--
justice
antonin
scalia
--they
haven't
done
what
they
have
been
ordered
to
do
yet,
nor
have
they
categorically
refused
to
do
what
they
have
been
ordered
to
do.
they
want
to
litigate
it
first
before
they
take
their
chances.
and
what
we
said
in
ryan
is,
you
have
to
take
your
chances.
go
into
contempt
and
then
we
will
see
whether
you
had
to
turn
it
over
or
not.
now,
why
should
there
be
a
different
rule
here?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
no
final
action
that
has
been
taken
against
anybody.
nobody
has
been
held
in
contempt.
no
defendant
has
been
acquitted.
nothing
final
has
happened.
justice
antonin
scalia
this
prosecution
is
still
proceeding,
isn't
it?
it
is
not
over.
justice
antonin
scalia
as
i
understand
it,
the
only
way
we
can
distinguish
the
next
case
where
a
litigant
is
ordered
to
turn
over
information
and
he
says
that
that
order
is
incorrect,
the
only
way
we
can
turn
down
an
appeal
from
that
order
without
requiring
him
to
take
his
chances
and
either
lose
the
case
or
go
into
contempt,
you
say
the
distinction
between
that
case
and
this
one
is
what,
that
here...
here
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
that
is
essentially
ryan
i
was
describing.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
here?
and
here
the
prosecution
is
absolutely
refusing
to
do
what
is
requested.
turn
them
over
to
the
counsel
for
the
other
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
sure
counsel
could
have
said
that
in
ryan,
too.
he
could
have
said,
your
honor,
my
client
is
not
going
to
take
the
chance
of
going
into
contempt.
if
you
don't
hear
this
appeal
now
he
is
going
to
turn
this
information
over,
and
we
said,
you
know,
we
are
sorry,
we
don't
sit
here
to
review
issues.
we
sit
here
to
review
final
actions,
and
there
is
no
final
action
in
this
court,
by
this
court,
so
go
away.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
and
when
it
is
set
aside
we
could
review
it
then,
right?
you
could
then
appeal
the
setting
aside
of
it
for
these
erroneous
grounds,
for
these
grounds
that
you
assert
are
erroneous.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
clark,
what
about
brady
versus
maryland?
that
is
not
really
a
compulsory
process
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
doesn't
require
a
specific
description
of
what...
in
fact
you
often
don't
know
what
the
prosecution
or
the
government
has,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
due
process
requires
that
if
you
ask
the
government
for
whatever
exculpatory
information
it
may
have
the
government
turn
that
over
it
that
would
be
material.
why
isn't
that
applicable?
justice
antonin
scalia
your
point
is
that
the
order
here
goes
beyond
brady
and
it
requires
it
all
to
be
turned
over
whether
in
fact
it
is
exculpatory
material
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
corbett,
isn't
it
true
that
the
kind
of
damage
you
are
responding
to
that
justice
white
suggested
will
always
occur
in
any
of
our
cases
such
as
ryan,
where
we
have
insisted
that
the
individual
who
asserts
a
right,
even
a
constitutional
right
not
to
disclose
information
which
the
court
requires
him
to
disclose
nonetheless
go
into
contempt
before
he
can
bring
it
up
here?
he
either
goes
into
contempt
or
else
he
turns
it
over.
if
he
turns
it
over
he
produces
exactly
the
result
which
the
constitution
assertedly
guarantees
won't
happen.
so
in
that
respect
i
would
think
your
response
would
be
the
state
is
in
no
different
situation
from
anyone
who
refuses
to
turn
material
over
or
says
he
will
refuse.
the
refusal
has
to
be
evident
before
we
intervene.
