jr.
no,
i
am
speaking
of
the

under
which

is
not--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--yes.
the
pennsylvania
statute.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
under
the

remand
would

the
amended
statute?

mr.

before
you
do--
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
--is
your
client
available
now?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
statements
in
that
file
did
you
say
included
statements
by
the
complaining
witness?
or
you
don't
know?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
was
this
anything
like
jencks
versus
united
states?
they
wanted
statements
of
the
government
witnesses,
in
order
to
cross
examine
to
show
inconsistencies
with
the
testimony?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.

of
course,
jencks
was
not
a
constitutional
decision,
though.
