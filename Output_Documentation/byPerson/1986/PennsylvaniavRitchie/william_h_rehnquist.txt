chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
now
in
no.
85-1347,
pennsylvania
against
george
f.
ritchie.
mr.
clark,
you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
we
reversed
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
in
this
case
the
result
would
be
that
the
conviction
stands
affirmed,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
certainly
that
i
would
think
would
prevent
the
case
from
being
moot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
it
seems
to
me
that
would
prevent
the
case
from
being
moot.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
a
decision
here
has
some
effect
on
the
rights
of
the
parties
before
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
you
didn't
recognize
it
at
first.
may
i
ask
on
a
somewhat
related
question,
is
the
respondent
a
fugitive?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
already
ordered
a
new
trial,
hasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clark,
you
might
be
well
advised
to
move
to
the
merits
since
you
only
have
half
an
hour.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
clark.
we
will
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
corbett.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
agree,
don't
you,
mr.
corbett,
that
one
of
the
bases
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania's
decision
was
its
perception
of
how
the
sixth
amendment
should
be
applied.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
are
you
contending,
mr.
corbett,
that
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
confrontation
confers
something
more
than
the
right
to
examine
a
witness
who
is
present
in
court
and
testifies?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
what
sixth
amendment
case
construing
the
confrontation
clause
of
ours
do
you
rely
on
for
that
proposition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
in
davis
the
effort
was
to
interrogate
the
witness
on
the
stand.
they
weren't
seeking
access
to
information
which
would
enable
them
to
interrogate
the
witness.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
the
effort
was
to
examine
the
witness
herself,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
in
davis.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean,
they
weren't...
were
they
seeking
in
davis
discovery
of
a
lot
of
allegedly
confidential
records
in
order
to
enable
them
to
prepare
to
examine
the
witness?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
certainly
our
case
of
delaware
against
fensterer
indicates
that
it
is
not
the
very
broad
view
that
you
subscribe
to
for
davis
that
is
controlling
with
us.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
your
claim
is
quite
different
than
the
one
in
van
arsdall.
in
van
arsdall
questions
were
asked
to
a
witness
on
the
stand
and
the
trial
judge
said,
no,
the
witness
is
not
required
to
answer
those
questions.
here,
no
one
prevented
you
from
asking
this
witness
any
question
you
wanted
to
on
the
stand.
your
complaint
is,
you
want
to
do
a
lot
of
discovery
work
before
you
start
asking
questions.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
corbett.
mr.
clark,
do
you
have
anything
else
you
wish
to
say?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
clark.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-1347,
pennsylvania
against
ritchie
will
be
announced
by
justice
powell.
