justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
court
already
has
the
records
that
are
to
be
opened.
is
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
does
the
trial
court
have
them
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
who
has
them
now?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
see.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
there
an
exception
in
ryan,
though,
when
privileged
information
is
in
the
hands
of
a
third
person?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
corbett,
doesn't
your
claim
fit
a
lot
more
easily
under
the
compulsory
process
clause
than
the
confrontation
clause
for
right
of
access
to
information?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
i
just
don't
see
that
you
were
denied
confrontation.
conceivably
there
is
some
compulsory
process
problem,
but
i
don't
see
that
it
fits
very
comfortably
under
the
confrontation
clause.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
have
you
made
a
plausible
showing
to
reveal
the
entire
record
as
opposed
to
just
verbatim
inconsistent
statements
of
the
witness?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
the
judge,
is
the
trial
judge
incompetent
to
make
the
determination
of
what
is
material?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
clark,
may
i
just
make
one
inquiry?
does
the
district
attorney
have
the
power
to
direct
the
child
welfare
service
not
to
turn
over
those
records?
