justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
this
case
is
here
from
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
it
presents
a
question
as
to
the
confidentiality
of
the
state's
child
abuse
records.
in
pennsylvania
there
is
a
state
agency
entitled
children
and
youth
services.
its
purpose
is
to
investigate
reports
of
child
abuse
and
state
law
provides
that
its
record
shall
be
confidential.
the
respondent
was
charged
with
sexual
abuse
of
his
daughter.
prior
to
his
trial
he
sought
access
to
the
records
pertaining
to
his
daughter
claiming
that
they
might
contain
exculpatory
information.
the
agency
refused
to
comply
with
the
subpoena
and
the
trial
judge
denied
respondent's
request
to
compel
disclosure.
respondent
was
convicted.
on
appeal
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court
disagreed
with
the
trial
court.
it
held
that
under
the
confrontation
and
the
compulsory
process
clauses
of
the
sixth
amendment
the
respondent
through
his
lawyer
was
entitled,
prior
to
trial
to
review
the
confidential
records
for
purpose
of
obtaining
information
that
might
be
relevant
to
his
defense.
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
opinion
filed
today
we
affirm
in
part
and
reverse
in
part
and
we
remand
the
case
for
further
proceedings.
respondent,
as
the
defendant
on
a
criminal
case,
is
entitled
to
have
the
trial
court
determine
whether
the
agency's
file
contains
information
material
to
his
defense,
but
we
also
find
that
respondent
is
not
entitled
to
examine
the
confidential
records.
the
commonwealth
has
a
compelling
interest
in
protecting
the
confidentiality
of
those
who
provide
information
on
child
abuse.
this
is
an
interest
that
is
shared
by
all
50
states
that
have
similar
laws.
we
think
the
respondent's
interest
in
a
fair
trial
can
be
protected
adequately
by
having
the
trial
judge
examine
the
records
in
camera
to
determine
whether
and
to
what
extent
they
contain
exculpatory
information.
justice
blackmun
has
filed
an
opinion
concurring
in
part
and
concurring
in
the
judgment;
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
has
joined;
justice
stevens
also
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justices
brennan
and
marshall
and
scalia
have
joined.
justice
stevens
and
the
justices
who
joined
him
conclude
that
the
judgment
below
was
not
filed
for
purposes
of
review.
therefore
they
did
not
reach
the
merits
of
this
case.
