mr.
edward
marcus
clark
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
before
you
today
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
the
commonwealth
has
contended
in
our
brief
that
the
intermediate
appellate
court
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
erroneously
construed
and
misapplied
two
very
important
segments
of
the
sixth
amendment
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
and
in
the
process
effectively
have
dismantled
a
very
elaborate
statutory
procedure
erected
to
encourage
more
complete
reporting
of
what
has
become
a
very
shameful
and
often
secret
crime,
the
sexual
abuse
of
children.
specifically,
the
court
below
erred,
we
contend,
in
concluding
that
the
compulsory
process
and
the
confrontation
clause
invariably
requires
that
a
criminal
defendant
in
a
sexual
offense
case
such
as
this
must
be
given
pretrial
access
to
confidential
records
compiled
by
a
child
protective
service
agency
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
the
records
were
never
used
or
employed
by
the
prosecution
at
any
stage
of
the
proceeding.
before
we
address
the
merits
of
those
contentions,
your
honors,
i
would
request
the
court's
indulgence
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
respondent
here
has
interposed
a
challenge
to
this
court's
jurisdiction
under
the
so-called
final
judgment
rule
it
title
28,
usc
section
1257.
in
view
of
that
i
would
like
to
briefly
summarize
the
factual
and
the
history
of
this
case
in
order
to
set
the
context
for
argument
on
that
issue.
respondent
was
charged
in
a
four-count
information
with
rape,
incest,
involuntary
deviant
sexual
intercourse,
and
corrupting
the
morals
of
children.
the
charging
document
alleged
a
course
of
conduct
that
spans
some
four
years.
the
specific
criminal
episode
giving
rise
to
the
charges,
however,
occurred
in
june
of
1979.
prior
to
trial,
respondent
initiated
discovery
proceedings
seeking,
among
other
things,
results
or
reports
involving
a
medical
examination
counsel
believed
had
taken
place
regarding
the
victim
in
this
case.
subsequently
he
issued
a
subpoena
to
the
children
and
youth
services
agency
of
allegheny
county
seeking
review
and
total
access
to
their
confidential
records
pertaining
to
the
victim.
the
agency
chose
not
to
surrender
those
records
to
the
respondent
based
on
that
subpoena,
and
as
a
result
respondent's
counsel,
trial
counsel
filed
a
pleading
called
a
motion
for
sanctions
and
a
hearing
was
convened
at
the
trial
court
level.
at
the
hearing,
respondent
informed
the
trial
court
that
he
had
to
have
access
to
these
medical
records
in
preparation
for
trial,
and
also
that
he
was
aware
that
there
had
been
conversations
between
the
complaining
victim
and
a
children
and
youth
services
caseworker.
in
addition
to
those
alerts,
red
flags
for
the
court
below,
respondent's
counsel
also
said
that
there
is
possible
witnesses,
witnesses
not
known
to
the
defendant.
there
could
be
witnesses
in
those
records
that
could
be
useful
in
my
defense,
matters
that
could
be
favorable
to
the
defendant.
based
on
that
presentation
the
trial
court
denied
relief,
denied
access
to
these
records,
and
characterized,
i
think
correctly,
the
assertions
or
the
offer
of
proof
by
respondent's
trial
counsel
as
too
vague
and
nonspecific.
of
course,
as
the
court
is
aware,
respondent
proceeded
to
trial,
was
convicted
by
a
jury,
and
ultimately
sentenced
to
a
term
of
imprisonment.
the
intermediate
appellate
court
of
pennsylvania,
the
superior
court,
without
having
considered
or
having
access
to
the
notes
of
testimony
from
that
pretrial
hearing,
concluded
that
the
procedures
employed
by
the
trial
court
below
failed
to
protect
the
respondent's
confrontation
rights,
his
privileges
there.
a
remand
was
ordered
and
the
trial
court
was
directed
to
review
these
records
for
purposes
of
determining
whether
or
not
there
was
a
statement
by
the
victim
pertaining
to
abuse.
so
far
so
good
as
far
as
the
commonwealth
is
concerned.
but
inexplicably
the
court
determined
that
respondent's
counsel
must
be
given
access
to
the
entire
file,
unexpurgated,
unexcised,
to
determine
whether
or
not...
in
order
to
be
able
to
present
argument
concerning
relevancy.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
i
am
sorry,
i
am
not
familiar
with
that
act.
are
you
speaking
of
the
final
judgment
rule,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
oh,
under
the
federal
rules,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
oh,
the
pennsylvania
statute,
yes,
it
was
amended
in
1982,
your
honor.
yes.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
i
presume
it
would
be
under
the
amended
statute,
your
honor.
the
commonwealth
wouldn't
have
any
problem
with
that.
the
supreme
court
reviewed
this
appellate
decision.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
well,
i
don't
believe
the
case
would
be
moot,
your
honor,
in
this
regard.
we
have--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--we
don't
think
that
the
amendments
to
the
statute
effectively
have
altered
the
basic
ruling
by
the
pennsylvania
supreme
court,
which
is
that
invariably
these
confidential
records
must
be
given
carte
blanche
to
a
criminal
defendant
in
this
case.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
the
prosecutor
has
access
to
reports
which
have
been
given
by
the
children
and
youth
agency
to
the
prosecutor.
the
prosecutor
does
not
customarily,
in
my
understanding
of
this
law,
has
not
delivered
those
files.
that
is
not
part
of
his
investigatory
tools,
your
honor.
the
regulations
governing
access
by
prosecutors
in
this
case
are
very
explicit
in
terms
of
the
kinds
of
crimes
which
require
their
disclosure,
the
forms
upon
which
the
information
that
is
given
to
the
police
department--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
understand.
your
honor
is
saying
that
this
would
moot
the
case?
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
oh,
absolutely
correct.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
absolutely,
your
honor.
absolutely.
i
thank
you
for
your
assistance
in
that
regard.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
not
to
my
understanding,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
i
believe
there
is
a
subsequent
communication
with
the
court,
your
honor,
involving,
i
believe
they
found
the
respondent
and
he
subsequently
signed
an
affidavit
attesting
to
his
pauper
status.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
he
is
not
incarcerated.
the
judgment
of
sentence
was
stayed
pending
direct
appeal
rights.
we
think
that,
not
to
belabor
the
obvious
here
in
terms
of
the
challenge
to
the
final
judgement
rule,
that
the
sixth
amendment
issues
here
have
been
finally
litigated,
certainly
in
the
highest
state
court
of
pennsylvania,
and
that
there
is
no
further
review
possible
in
our...
justice
scalia,
i
am
sorry
you
are
indicating
your
disagreement.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
i
think
in
united
states
versus
ryan,
your
honor,
those
cases
involve
the
absolute
refusal
to
divulge
and
to
deliver
certain
materials.
the
commonwealth
is
not
in
a
position
of
arguing
that
kind
of
situation.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
understand
that.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
well,
the
trial
court
here
already
had
access
to
these
records.
the
children
and
youth
services
agency
surrendered
those
records,
as
they
have
a
practice
of
doing.
in
fact,
one
of
the
subparts
of
the
confidentiality
statute
exempts
courts
of
competent
jurisdiction
precisely
to
handle
these
kinds
of
controversies
so
that
where--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--they
have
not
been
given
to
the
attorney
for
the
other
side.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
they
have
not
been
ordered--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--i
think
beforehand
it
would
be
a
requirement
of
the
respondent
here
to
request
the
state
supreme
court
to
enforce
its
mandate
before
we...
the
children
and
youth
services
is
not
in
sort
of
some
kind
of
limbo
contempt
situation
here
because
it
hasn't
delivered
these
files
yet.
we
immediately
appealed.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
a
defendant
has
been
convicted,
your
honor--
--the
court
has
said
if--
--and
a
sixth
amendment
issue
has
been
authoritatively
decided
by
a
state
court,
arguably
incorrectly,
and
as
a
result
of
that
we
have
a
situation
where
the
state
trial
courts
of
pennsylvania
are
routinely
permitting
criminal
defendants
to
scavenge.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
i
don't
think
it's
over
any
more
than
the
fact
that
as
this
court
did
in
south
dakota
versus
neville
where
the
state
supreme
court
there
had
authoritatively
adjudicated
a
federal
constitutional
issue
and
remanded
the
case
to
the
trial
court
for
further
proceedings
on
another
matter,
and
this
court
determined
that
it
still
had
jurisdiction
to
decide
the
issue
in
view
of
the
fact
that
no
matter
who
prevailed
at
the
trial
court
level,
the
issue
would
either
be
mooted
or
the
state
would
be
prevented
from
proceeding
any
further
in
the
united
states
supreme
court
by
virtue
of
the
double
jeopardy
clause.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
between
ryan
and
this
case,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
in
ryan
the
defendant
absolutely
refused
to
disclose
these,
to
surrender
his--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--the
agency
was
directed
to
surrender
those
records
initially
to
the
trial
court,
your
honor.
here,
the
order
from
the
supreme
court,
yes.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
the
supreme
court
has...
i'm
sorry.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
presumably
the
prosecution
would
be
dismissed
at
that
point.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
there
will
be
a
new
trial.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
the
supreme
court...
no,
it
has
ordered
a
remand,
your
honor,
tot
purposes
of
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
determine
whether
or
not
harmless
error
occurred.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
the
trial
court
at
one
time
had
custody
of
those
records.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
those
records
are
with
the
children
and
youth
services
agency.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
that
agency
has
not
been
ordered
by
the
court
pending
this
appeal
to
surrender
those
records.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
in
a
largely
ceremonial
sense,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
well,
as
i
understand
it
from
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
your
honor,
apparently
trial
counsel
was
to
make
that
determination,
a
rather
unusual--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--the
trial
counsel
will
second-guess
the
trial
courts,
the
appellate
courts.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
certainly,
your
honor,
they
would.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
i
should
think
so.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
it
will
never
be
raised
here
in
this
court
with
that
case,
your
honor.
there
is
another
aspect
to
this
finality
argument
that
we
have,
this
finality
theory
that
we
have
that
the
very
harm
that
we
seek
to
avoid
here,
the
disclosure
of
those
confidential
records
will
happen
as
soon
as
that
remand
takes
place.
and
in
our
view
this
is
virtually
an
irretrievable
loss
if
we
are
correct
on
our
theory
of
the
sixth
amendment
issue.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
it
is
not
final
in
the
sense,
your
honor,
that
there
are
further
proceedings
to
come.
that
is
absolutely
correct.
but
this
court's
line
of
cases
beginning
from
cox
broadcasting--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
i
am
not
sure
that
i
can
represent
that
a
refusal
to
surrender
these
records
is
what
is
going
to
happen.
those
records--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--if...
in
the
event
there
is
a
refusal?
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
is
that
what
you
are
saying,
your
honor?
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
i
believe
that
the
mandate
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
is
that
children
and
youth
services
will
surrender
their
records
to
the
trial
court.
presumably
if
the
trial
court
wants
those
records
it
will
order
them,
as
it
may
under
the
statute.
when
that
occurs
the
trial
court,
as
the
opinion
indicates,
is
expected
to
review
these
files
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
would
be
anything
in
there
that
might
have
been
helpful
to
the
respondent
in
preparing
his
defense.
then
the
court
is
to
surrender
those
records
to
the
respondent
so
that
he
may
do
his
second
guessing
evaluation
of
the
trial
court's
exercise
of
discretion.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
thank
you
very
much,
your
honor.
in
returning
to
the
merits,
the
commonwealth
would
observe
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
erred
in
three
specific
respects.
it
misconstrued
or
misapplied
the
application
of
the
confrontation
clause
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case.
it
erroneously
concluded
that
counsel's
otter
at
the
pretrial
proceeding
was
a
sufficient
preliminary
demonstration
of
materiality
so
as
to
trigger,
if
there
is
a
compulsory
process
issue
here,
that
clause,
and
it
incorrectly
concluded,
we
believe,
that
the
two
clauses
in
effect
have...
cannot
countenance
the
ex
parte
judicial
review
of
these
confidential
records
which
the
commonwealth
insists
must
occur.
the
privilege
of
confrontation
is
exclusively
a
trial
right.
the
situation
complained
of
here
involves
a
pretrial
decision
involving
pretrial
matters.
facially
the
confrontation
clause
is
not
applicable
here.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
relied
on
davis
v.
alaska
as
dispositive
of
the
issue,
falling
to
understand,
i
believe,
that
the
constitutional
error
that
this
court
found
in
davis
v.
alaska
was
the
restriction
on
the
trial
lawyer's
attempt
to
cross
examine
a
witness
concerning
his
juvenile
status,
attempting
to
coax
from
him
the
fact
that
he
might
have
suspect
motives
in
testifying.
this
is
an
inapt
analogy,
we
believe,
to
this
case.
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
compulsory
process
clause
provides
perhaps
more
expansive
privilege,
and
if
it
does
it
might
be
applicable
here.
certainly
the
compulsory
process
clause
is
available
to
a
criminal
defendant
in
a
pretrial
context.
privileges
guaranteed
under
that
clause,
we
think,
however,
require
a
respondent,
a
defendant
to
identify
with
some
particularity
the
witnesses
or
the
evidence
that
he
would
seek
to
have
the
court
compel
for
his
use
at
trial.
the
respondent's
litany
of
could
be's
does
not
meet
that
minimal
test
of
materiality
which
this
court
has
discussed
most
recently
in
united
states
versus
valenzuela
bernal.
there
the
court
determined
that
it
is
imperative
upon
the
person
seeking
access
to
what
apparently
is
information
he
cantor
possibly
know
the
contents
of
to
make
some
plausible
theory
about
how
a
witness
might
be
used,
what
that
witness
might
be
capable
or
competent
to
describe,
and
so
forth.
under
this
court's
discussion
there,
i
believe,
which
is
dispositive
of
the
compulsory
process
clause
issue
before
this
court,
it
cannot
be
doubted
that
the
offer
by
the
respondent
was
so
vague,
so
generalized,
so
undirected
that
the
trial
count
simply
had
no
information
upon
which
to
exercise
its
discretion.
i
would
hasten
to
assure
the
court
that
the
respondent
was
very
well
aware
of
the
names
of
the
caseworker
who
was
involved
in
interviewing
the
child,
the
name
of
the
doctor
who
treated
or
examined
the
victim,
and
that
he
very
well
could
have
sought
the
trial
court's
assistance
in
isolating
statements
made
by
either
one
of
those
parties
that
might
be
in
that
tile
because
those
people
would
be
competent
to
testify
about
some
aspect
presumably
of
the
criminal
defendant's
preparation
for
trial.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
no,
your
honor,
that
is
a
due
process
case.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
that's
absolutely
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
it
could
very
well
be,
your
honor,
in
this
regard.
those
files
never
having
been
in
the
possession
of
the
commonwealth,
but
having
been
in
the
possession
of
the
trial
court,
it
may
very
well
be
that
the
trial
court
could
make
that
preliminary
determination
regarding
whether
or
not
there
is
exculpatory
evidence
in
there,
and
i
am
not
here
today
to
attempt
to
say
that
where
exculpatory
evidence
exists
and
where
the
commonwealth
as
a
law
enforcement
representative
would
have
some
access
to
that
confidential
material,
that
there
wouldn't
be
any
obligation
of
someone
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
was
exculpatory
material.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
that
is
absolutely
right,
your
honor.
what
distinguishes
this
from
brady
material,
of
course,
is
that
it
was
never
in
the
possession
of
the
attorney
for
the
commonwealth,
the
prosecutor,
and
i
think
that
is
the
essence
of
the
brady
decision,
because--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--it
certainly
would,
your
honor,
and
i
am
quite...
the
commonwealth
is
quite
content
to
represent
that
we
believe
the
trial
court
is
in
a
very
excellent
position
to
make
these
discriminating
choices
between
extraneous
material
and
matter
which
is
certainly
dangerous.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
it
is
difficult
to
tell
from
reading
the
record,
your
honor,
but
it
appears
that
i
could
imagine
the
trial
judge,
knowing
him
as
i
do,
leafing
through
things.
there
is
no
way
to
demonstrate
that
from
the
record,
however.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
he
said
he
hadn't
read
all
50
pages.
i
think
the
dialogue
goes--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--i
believe
the
dialogue
goes
something
like
this,
your
honor.
respondent's
counsel
sought
medical
records.
he
says,
there's
medical
records
in
there,
i
know
there
are,
and
the
trial
court
apparently
leafed
through
some
material--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--and
said,
i
don't
see
any
medical
records
in
there,
and
he
apparently
turned
to
the
representative
of
the
child
protective
service
agency
and
said,
are
there
any
medical
records
in
here
that
were
representative?
he
said
there
were
not.
and
that
apparently
concluded
that
inquiry.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
absolutely,
your
honor,
based
on
the
proffer
made
by
respondent's
counsel.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
he
had
a
duty
to
look
in
a
file
if
he
got
a
specific
request
for
a
specific
kind
of--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--at
that
point
no,
your
honor.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
at
that
point
no.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
he
wanted
medical
records.
he
looked
for
some
evidence--
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
--there
aren't
any.
apparently
he
was
able
to
make
that
kind
of
a
discriminating
choice
by
leafing
through
how
many
ever
pages
there
were
in
that
record.
and
in
that...
i
would...
if
there
are
no
further
questions
by
the
court
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
thank
your
your
honor.
very
briefly,
i
would
like
to
address
the
figurehead
role
that
the
respondent's
counsel
seems
to
envision
for
the
trial
court.
it
is
kind
of
an
enfeebled
referee
or
arbiter,
which
this
court
has
specifically
declined
to
assign
to
the
trial
court
judge
in
situations
like
that,
and
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
mobles
this
court
clearly
indicated
its
disfavor
with
the
contention
that
the
trial
court
should
not
be
in
the
position
of
evaluating
preliminarily
these
kinds
of
determinations.
mr.
edward
marcus
clark
absolutely
no,
we
do
not
have
that
power.
i
can't
imagine
the
circumstances
under
which
we
would.
we
have
the
power
to
perhaps
seek
courts'
assistance
in
getting
material
for
ourselves
which
is
due
us
under
the
statute,
and
with
the
court's
indulgence
i
would
like
to
backtrack.
i
believe
on
a
question
that
justice
brennan
asked
regarding
whether
or
not,
if
we
went
back
on
a
remand,
whether
or
not
the
proceeding
would
be
decided
under
the
immunity
statute
or
under
the
old
statute.
i
think
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
amendments
to
the
statute
involve
the
new
access
to
prosecutors
and
the
issue
before
this
court
is
the
access
of
defendant
to
those
statutes,
that
more
appropriately
the
proceedings
should
occur
under
the
1975
act
rather
than
the
1982
amendment.
and
in
view
of
the
fact
that
the
scant
proffer
concerning
materiality
by
the
respondent,
our
lack
of
access
initially
to
those
records,
and
respondent's
failure
to
follow
up
his
request
at
the
cross
examination
stage
at
trial,
we
believe
that
the
integrity
of
the
judgment
and
conviction
here
is
best
served
by
analyzing
the
case
under
the
1975
act,
your
honor.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
from
the
court
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
would
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
judgment
of
sentence
below,
rather,
the
judgment
and
order
by
the
supreme
court,
and
in
effect
affirm
the
trial
court's
decision.
