well,
isn't
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--it
there
is
a
refusal
to
turn
them
over
won't
the
conviction
be
set
aside?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
would
suppose
it
would
because
if
they
are
turned
over
and
there
is
something
in
them
that
the
defendant
should
have
had
during
the
trial,
there
is
going
to
be
a
new
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
is
the
court
that
is
going
to
look
at
them
under
this
order.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
who
is
going
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
something
in
the
records
that
requires
a
new
trial?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
mean
the
trial
counsel
will
say,
i
found
something
in
here
that
i
think--
justice
byron
r.
white
--he
is
going
to
have
to
argue
with
the
trial
court
about
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
if
the
trial
court
agrees
with
them
there
is
going
to
be
a
new
trial.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
there
is
a
new
trial
and
he
is
acquitted,
you
will
never
be
able
to
have
this
question
raised
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
you
refuse,
the
conviction
is
going
to
be
set
aside.
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
the
trial
judge
say
he
hadn't
read
those
50
pages?
justice
byron
r.
white
of
the
nonmedical
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
said
there
wasn't
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
he
wanted
medical
records.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
judge
said,
there
aren't
any.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
seems
to
me
the
harm
that
the
state
statute
or
the
state
rule
was
designed
to
prevent,
namely,
the
disclosure
of
these
records,
will...
the
harm
will
have
been
done.
and
what
the
state
wants
to
do
is
to
prevent
access
to
these
records
insofar
as
the
constitution
will
permit,
and
if
this
case
goes
back
the
records
will
be
turned
over
to
counsel
and
harm
will
be
done,
and
that
is
precisely
what
the
state
wants
to
prevent.
it
is
sort
of
like
a
double
jeopardy
issue.
justice

xxx
require
turning
over
these
materials
to
the
defense
attorney?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
do
you
think
that
is--
justice
byron
r.
white
--do
you
think
that
has
much
to
do
with
finality,
how
great
the
harm
is?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
davis
is
the
closest
case
to
supporting
you?
