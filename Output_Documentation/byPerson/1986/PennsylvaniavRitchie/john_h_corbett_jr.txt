mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
provides
an
opportunity
for
this
court
to
reaffirm
its
concern
for
the
integrity
of
the
truthseeking
function
of
state
criminal
trials.
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
held
in
this
case
that
the
integrity
of
its
criminal
trials,
the
truthseeking
function
embodied
in
those
trials
is
paramount
to
this
privilege
statute,
a
statute
created
under
pennsylvania
law,
and
in
doing
so
it
did
not
render
that
statute
unconstitutional.
it
did
not
declare
that
statute
unconstitutional,
but
interpreted
that
statute
and
sent
the
case
back
to
the
trial
court
for
determination
of
whether
there
is
material
in
the
cws
files,
the
child
welfare
service
files
to
determine
further
if
that
material,
if
relevant
the
suppression
of
that
material
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
if
a
new
trial
was
warranted.
in
doing
so,
the
decision
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania,
we
would
state
to
this
court,
is
not
a
final
decision
under
section
1257.
certainly
it
does
not
fit
the
classic
definition
of
finality
because
there
are
a
number
of
things
for
the
trial
court
to
do
other
than
simply
to
record
a
judgment.
the
trial
court
must
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
camera
to
determine
the
relevancy
at
the
material
in
the
cws
files.
it
must
determine
if
the
suppression
of
such
evidence
was
harmless
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt,
and
if
necessary
determine
whether
a
new
trial
was
warranted.
furthermore,
this
case
does
not
present
itself
as
a
classic
example
of
those
kind
of
cases
which
this
court
identified
in
cox
broadcasting
company
as
being
a
final
judgment
for
purposes
of
appeal
to
this
court.
there
are
a
number
of
things
to
be
done
in
the
lower
court,
and
the
issue
that
the
district
attorney
of
allegheny
county
is
presenting
to
this
court
will
not
evade
review.
if
the
material
goes
back...
if
this
case
goes
back
to
the
trial
court
and
a
new
trial
is
granted
then
the
district
attorney
can
then
once
more
go
through
the
various
stages
of
appeal
and
bring
this
case
to
this
court.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
if
i
may,
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
the
first
is
that
the
district
attorney
is
bringing
a
sixth
amendment
issue
to
this
court
but
it
is
not
claiming
a
sixth
amendment
injury.
it
is
in
fact
presenting
sub
silencio
a
tenth
amendment
issue
for
this
court
to
consider.
and
that
is
that
by
interpreting
the
sixth
amendment
claim
in
this
fashion
it
is
saying
that
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
has
applied
excessive
federal
regulation
to
a
state
statute,
and
in
that
manner
is
attempting
to
bring
this
case
to
this
court
under
the
rubric
of
a
sixth
amendment
case
when
in
fact
the
district
attorney
has
not
suffered
a
sixth
amendment
injury,
and
it
is
not
the
type--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--absolutely.
absolutely,
but--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--yes,
it
did.
that
goes
to
the
second...
my
second
response
to
justice
white's
question
before,
and
that
is,
this
disclosure
of
material
in
the
cws
files
is
not
such
a
great
harm
that
this
court
should
be
concerned
with
it.
under
this
state
statute,
the
state
statute
that
was
in
effect
at
the
time
this
case
went
to
trial,
there
were
five
classes
of
individuals
who
were
entitled
to
gain
access
to
this
material--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--one
of
which--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--yes,
i
think
it
does,
whether
or
not
the
type
of
harm
that
the
district
attorney
is
propounding
is
irreparable
i
think
is
a
concern
that
this
court
must
face
here.
what
i
am
saying
here
is
that
this
state
statute
gives
access
to
five
groups
of
individuals,
which
was
later
expanded
to
eleven
groups
of
individuals,
and
under
both
statutes
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
court
order
had
access
to
this
material,
and
i
suggest
that
that
is
a
classic
subpoena
order.
secondly,
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
remanded
this
case
to
the
trial
court
with
instructions
that
this
material
be
reviewed
in
camera
and
that
appropriate
protective
orders
be
imposed
upon
counsel
for
the
dissemination
of
that
material,
so
that
this
material
is
not
going
to
be
disseminated
widely
to
the
public.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
yes.
thank
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
well,
that
brings
us
to
a
difficulty
with
this
case,
and
that
is
that
the
district
attorney
is
really
wearing
two
hats
in
bringing
this
case
to
this
court.
the
district
attorney
is
wearing
the
hat
of
the
privilege
holder
in
withholding
the
information
and
also
as
the
litigator
in
a
case
and
that
they
are
interested
in
maintaining
the
judgment
they
have
in
their
favor.
i
think
the
court
understands
my
argument
on
the
finality
issue.
i
would
like
to
then
move
on
to
the
substantive
issue
itself
dealing
with
the--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
he
is,
as
mr.
clark
pointed
out,
we
had
some
difficulty
in
locating
this
individual.
he
was
not
in
any
way
a
fugitive.
we
have
supplied
his
affidavit
to
the
court.
it
is
a
matter
of
record.
moving
on,
then,
to
the
confrontation
and
compulsory
process
issue
itself,
the
facts
in
this
case
are
extremely
important
in
order
for
the
court
to
understand
exactly
what
transpired,
both
during
the
pretrial
hearing
in
chambers
where
the
cws
records
were
discussed
and
also
during
the
trial.
the
facts
as
adduced
during
these
proceedings
indicate
that
the
complainant
was
the
13-year-old
daughter
of
my
client.
the
criminal
charges
arose
out
of
an
event
that
occurred
on
june
11th,
1979.
this
young
girl
was
the
only
witness
at
trial
to
establish
that
any
type
of
a
crime
had
ever
occurred.
there
was
no
other
type
of
direct
testimony,
no
other
type
of
circumstantial
evidence
entered
of
any
kind
whatsoever
that
any
crime
had
ever
occurred.
this
girl
indicated
that
these
events
had
occurred
three
or
four
times
a
week
for
a
period
of
four
years.
during
her
testimony
at
trial
and
also
in
the
pretrial
hearing
defense
counsel
was
able
to
point
out
that
in
september,
the
previous
september
of
1978
a
representative
of
cws
had
investigated
the
ritchie
home
and
that
no
criminal
charges
had
been
filed
at
that
tame,
no
further
action
taken.
it
is
significant
for
our
purposes
to
point
to
that
september
of
1978
to
indicate
that
we
had
in
the
home
a
representative
of
the
state
who
apparently
interviewed
the
members
of
the
family,
and
no
criminal
charges
arose
from
that
incident.
the
complainant
gave
statements
to
that
representative
of
cws,
and
yet
we
were
denied
the
opportunity
to
look
at
that
material,
to
cross
examine
the
complainant
during
the
trial.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
the
sixth
amendment
right
to
confrontation,
i
think,
gives
the
defendant
the
opportunity
to
develop
the
facts,
to
see
where
the
truth
lies,
and
does
so
by
giving
the...
by
giving
the
defense
an
effective
opportunity
to
cross
examine
the
witness.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
i
think
quite
frankly
our
strongest
case
here
is
davis
versus
alaska,
where
in
its
broadest
sense
the
case
may
be
read
to
state
that
a
state
may
not
deny
its
confrontation
claim
or
confrontation
obligations
simply
by
alleging
that
the
evidence
that
it
wishes
to
withhold
is
privileged
by...
under
state
law.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
they
were...
in
davis
they
mere
also
looking
to...
they
were
looking
to
obtain
facts
from
which
they
could
cross
examine
the
witness
during
the
trial.
those
facts
existed
in
juvenile
records.
in
this
case
we
have--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--in
this
case,
yes.
in
davis.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
yes.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
no,
they
weren't.
in
davis,
davis
dealt
with
the
possible
basis
of
bias
or
prejudice
of
the
witness
in
testifying
in
the
manner
in
which
he
did.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
that
may
be
true.
however,
in
fenster
you
had
a
situation
where
the
defense
was
able
to
bring
in
a
witness
to
present
facts
on
their
own
side
of
the
case
to
show
that
the
expert
witness
in
that
case
called
for
the
prosecution
had
no
basis
for
such
an
opinion,
that
such
an
opinion
was
not
recognized
in
the
body
of
scientific
knowledge.
in
this
case
the
only
source
that
the
defense
could
point
to
to
obtain
those
facts
were
contained
in
the
cws
files.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
we
think
they
should.
we
don't
know.
there
was--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--i
think
it
is
very
similar
to
jencks,
yes.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
well,
in
this
case
i
think
that...
i
think
that
in
order
to
cross
examine
this
witness
we
have
to
be
given
access
to
that
material.
there
is
no
other
source
for
that
kind
of
material.
certainly
if
it
were
not
for
this
state
statute
those
statements
would
be
available
to
us.
it
is
only
but
for
this
state
statute--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--no.
no,
your
honor,
it
does
not.
this
court
last
term
in
delaware
versus
van
arsdall
indicated
that
defendant
shows
a
violation
of
his
right
of
confrontation
by
showing
that
he
has
been
prohibited
from
engaging
in
otherwise
appropriate
cross
examination
designed
to
show
a
prototypical
form
of
bias
on
the
part
of
a
witness
and
thereby
to
expose
to
the
jury
facts
from
which
the
jury
could
appropriately
draw
inferences
relating
to
the
reliability
of
the
witness.
we
are
asking
the
court
that
we
have
been
denied
the
opportunity
to
look
at
those
facts,
to
bring
those
facts
before
the
trier
of
fact,
here
the
jury,
and
have
the
jury--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--well,
what
i
am
complaining
about
is
the
fact
that
as
in
davis
the
jury
may
very
veil
have
thought
that
defense
counsel's
cross
examination
of
the
victim
concerning
this
investigation
in
september
of
1978
may
have
been
a
baseless
ground
of
attack.
here
me
have
a
situation
where
the
principal
issue
at
trial
was
the
credibility
of
two
parties,
the
complainant
and
the
defendant,
and
it
may
very
well
have
tipped
the
scale
for
the
jury
to
have
heard
a
different
version
of
the
facts
that
the
complainant
gave
on
prior
occasions.
and
in
that
respect
i
am
saying
that
there
lies
the
violation
of
the
right
to
confrontation.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
i
think
this
case
presents...
i
think
both
the
confrontation
and
the
compulsory
process
issues
go
hand
in
glove.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
okay.
if
i
may
just
point
out
one
matter
concerning
that,
on
the...
whether
or
not
the
defense
has
shown
whether
they
have
made
out...
whether
the
claim
is
material,
whether
or
not
the
suppression
of
such
evidence
undermines
confidence
in
the
outcome
of
the
case
is
the
standard
of
materiality
that
this
court
must
wrestle
with.
here
we
have
more
than
a
"plausible
showing",
as
the
court
indicated
under--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--well,
we
have
the
cws
files.
the
record
indicates,
the
entire
record
indicates
that
the
cws
files
contain
facts
that
the
commonwealth
of
pennsylvania
has
gathered--
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
--no,
i
don't
think
it
is
a
matter
of
declaring
whether
or
not
a
trial
judge
is
or
is
not
incompetent.
as
we
indicated
in
our
brief
in
the
case
of
alderman
v.
united
states,
this
court
indicated
that
it
is
enough
for
judges
to
judge,
and
in
that
case
it
is
useful
to
have
the
defense,
defense
counsel
participate
in
deciding
whether
or
not
material
is
useful
to
the
defense.
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
several
steps
that
one
can
go
through
in
analyzing
whether
or
not
defense
counsel
should
participate,
one
of
which
is
whether
or
not
the
case
is
factually
complex
in
itself.
i
suggest
that
when
this
type
of
criminal
case
arises
where
you
have
claims
of
abuse
arising
in
a
family
relationship
that
is
a
quite
complex
factual
determination,
and
a
trial
judge
sitting...
the
best
trial
judge
sitting
as
objectively
as
he
possibly
can,
in
looking
at
this
material
would
or
may
very
well
overlook
something
that
would
have
great
significance
to
the
defense.
in
looking
at
the
privilege
statute
that
is
the
bone
of
contention
in
this
case,
one
of
the
classes
of
categories
of
individuals
who
have
access
to
this
information
is
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
pursuant
to
court
order.
we
argued
in
the
state
courts,
and
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania
agreed
with
us,
that
it
would
be
absurd
to
suggest
that
a
court
is
granted
access
to
this
file,
and
yet
it
is
not
free
to
use
that
material
to
assist
in
the
truthseeking
function
of
the
criminal
trials.
in
determining
which
remedy
should
be
applied
in
looking
at
this
material
contained
in
the
file,
whether
or
not
defense
counsel
should
participate,
we
have
set
forth
in
our
brief
two
alternate
lines
of
cases
looking
at
this
particular
situation.
one
was
under
the
dicta
of
this
court
in
the
case
of
united
states
versus
nixon,
where
the
court
suggested
that
the
case
would
be
remanded
back
to
the
trial
court
in
order
to
have
the
trial
judge
review
this
material
in
chambers
with
counsel
present
and
counsel
would
then...
or
the
trial
judge
would
then
have
the
benefit
of
counsel's
advice
on
determining
what
information
is
relevant
and
material
to
the
action.
the
second
line
of
cases
that
we
have
outlined
for
the
court
in
our
brief
concerns
those
cases
arising
under
the
freedom
of
information
act.
these
cases
arise
under
the
various
courts,
federal
courts
of
appeals,
and
in
those
situations
the
courts
have
required
the
party
withholding
the
information
to
prepare
affidavits
indicating
why
the
information
should
not
be
turned
over
to
the
opposing
party,
and
also
an
affidavit
to
assist
the
judge,
the
trial
judge
in
reviewing
the
material.
both
the
affidavit
and
the
material
would
then
be
sealed
and...
placed
under
seal
for
review
by
appellate
courts.
since
that
procedure
was
not
used
in
the
present
case
and...
we
would
submit
to
the
court
that
in
the
absence
of
such
a
procedure
defense
counsel
must
assist
the
trial
judge
in
determining
the
materiality
of
this
material
in
order
to
ensure
the
integrity
of
this
truthseeking
process.
with
no
further
questions,
i
would
request
the
court
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
supreme
court
of
pennsylvania.
mr.
john
h.
corbett,
jr.
i
think
davis
would
be
the
closest
case
concerning
the
confrontation
issue
and
possibly
washington
versus
texas
being
the
closest
case
on
the
compulsory
process
issue.
thank
you,
your
honors.
