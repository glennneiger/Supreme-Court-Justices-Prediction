justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
weinberg,
would
you
contest
that
the
union
would
be
guilty
of
racial
discrimination
if
it
just
absolutely
refused
to
process
any
grievances
based
on
racial
grounds,
and
they
refused
to
process
them
because
they
just
didn't
want
to
process
racial
grievances?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
the
union...
could
it
be
inferred,
could
racial
animus
be
inferred
from
the
fact
that
they
just
never
processed
a
racial
grievance;
they
just
don't
do
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
in
any
event,
i
think
from
your
recitation
of
the
facts
that
that
claim
was
found
in
your
favor
by
the
district
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
no...
was
there...
there
was
no
finding
that
the
union
refused
to
process
a
grievance
because
it
was
a
racial
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
when
there
wasn't
another
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
it
ever
file
a
racial
grievance
where
there
wasn't
any
other
ground?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
was
found...
so
found
by
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
did
the
court
of
appeals
affirm
on
the
basis
that...
that
the
district
court
used?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
racial
grievance.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
different...
isn't
that
different
than
saying
the
refusal
to
process
it
was
based
on
racial
animus?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it
you
are...
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
hold
that
the
union
has
an
affirmative
duty
to
combat
employer
discrimination
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
are
you
defending
that
statement?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
all
right
with
you,
if
we
agree...
if
we
agree
with
you,
we
nevertheless
disaffirm
what
the
court
of
appeals
said
about
an
affirmative
duty
on
the
union?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
there's
a
square
finding
or
facts
in
the
record
that
indicate
that
a
black
person
comes
to
the
union
and
says,
i
was
fired
because
i'm
black
or
wasn't
promoted
because
i'm
black
and
i
want
a
grievance;
and
the
union
says,
i
understand
your
claim,
and
i
have
no
doubt
that's
why
the
employer
did
it,
but
we're
just
not
going
to
file
a
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
we
don't
discriminate.
the
union
says,
we
don't...
we're
not
doing
it
because
of
race,
but
we
just
don't
want
to
make
the
employer
mad.
we're
just
not
going
to
file
it.
now,
are
there
findings
like
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
some...
what
kind
of
grievances
did
they
refuse
to
file
altogether
which
would
have
been
racial
grievances?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be.
well,
did
they...
did
they
actually...
are
there
some
instances
where
they
actually
refused
to
file
a
grievance--
justice
byron
r.
white
--because
it
was
a
racial
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
did
the
district
court
find
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
again,
did...
are
there...
were
there
findings
that...
that
the
union
wouldn't
file
a
grievance
at
all
because
it
was
a
racial
grievance?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
kind
there
are.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
there
specific
cases
where
the
union
refused
to
file
any
grievance
at
all
because
it
was
a
racial
grievance?
