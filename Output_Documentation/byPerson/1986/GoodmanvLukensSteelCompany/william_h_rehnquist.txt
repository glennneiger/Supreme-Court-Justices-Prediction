chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
on
two
consolidated
cases,
no.
85-1626,
goodman
against
lukens
steel,
and
no.
85-2010,
united
steelworkers
against
goodman.
mr.
weinberg,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
make
a
finding
as
to
why
the
union
had
not
raised
claims
of
racial
discrimination
on
grievances?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
if
the
district
court
here
had
found
that
the
union
failed
to
present
race
discrimination
claims
when
it
could
have,
that
it
was
not
racially...
that
it
was
not
discriminating
between
black
people
and
white
people,
that
its
reason
for
failing
to
do
that
was
simply
its
lack
of
expertise.
we're
used
to
seniority
claims;
we're
not
used
to
race
discrimination
claims.
would
that
state
a
violation
of
the
union's
duty
as
you
see
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
might
have...
from
what
you
say,
that
might
have
been
an
easier
ground
to
prove
that
the
very
complicated
job
relatedness
ground.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
weinberg.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ewing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
district
court
say
that
the
union
decision
was
motivated
by
racial
animus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
of
course,
i
take
it
it
wasn't
inadvertent
on
their
part.
they
did
intentionally
refuse
to
file
them.
but
was
the
reason
a
racially
motivated
one?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
my
earlier
question
to
you,
mr.
ewing,
was
a
factual
one
rather
than
a
legal
one.
i
was
interested
in
finding
out
exactly
what
sort
of
intent,
if
any,
the
district
found
the
union
to
have.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
i
suppose
that
would
be
obvious
just
from
the
action.
did
it
go
further
and
say
that
the
reason
that
it
had
this
policy
was
because
of
racial
animus?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
you
consciously,
knowingly
do
something,
it's
intentional
in
your
view,
without
regard
to
the
motive?
if
the
union
consciously
adopts
a
policy
of
not
processing
racial
grievances,
from
whatever
motive,
that
is
intentional
discrimination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
did
the
evidence
show
that
the
only
probationary
dischargees
were
black?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
were
any...
any
white
probationary
grievances
claims
grieved?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
contract
gave
the
probationers
no
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ewing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
weinberg,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weinberg.
the
case
is
submitted.
