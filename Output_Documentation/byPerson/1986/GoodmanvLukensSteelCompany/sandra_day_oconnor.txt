justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
weinberg,
did
the
third
circuit
deal
with
the
theory
of
liability
as
one
of
a
breach
of
a
duty
of
fair
representation--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--rather
than
a
direct
violation
of
title
vii
or
section
1981?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
we
have
to
deal
with
that
as
a
theory,
i
suppose?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
weinberg,
what
if
the
district
court
had
made
a
finding
relative
to
the
title
vii
claim
that
the
unions
method
and
practices
in
the
processing
of
employee
grievances
had
a
disparate
impact
on
blacks?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
asked,
what
if
the
trial
court
had
made
that
finding?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
that's
not
entirely
clear
to
me.
is
there
any
substantial
body
of
authority
to
support
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
district
court
here
didn't
make
a
finding
one
way
or
the
other
on
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
was
a
title
vii
claim.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
does
that...
could
that
amount
to
a
disparate
impact
finding,
in
effect--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--that
the
union
didn't
process
claims,
for
whatever
reasons,
for
probationary
employees,
and
that
failure
had
this
disparate
impact
because
so
many
of
the
probationers
being
discharged
or
let
go
were
black?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
rely
on--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--you
rely
here
on
a
disparate
treatment
theory?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
what
are
you
relying
on
here
to
support
you?
a
disparate
treatment
analysis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
there
was
no
finding
of
the
district
court,
was
there,
of
disparate
impact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
you
show
me,
tell
me,
where
in
the
record
i
would
find
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that's--
--that's
a
finding
of
disparate
impact,
in
your
view?
