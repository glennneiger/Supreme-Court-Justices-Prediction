no,
you
would
say
that...
that
even
if
in
fact
it
were
proven,
as
you
assert
it
was
not
proven
here
except
with
respect
to
probationers,
perhaps,
that
the
union
categorically
would
not
process
racial
discrimination
grievances,
and
would
not
do
so
because...
well,
never
mind...
just
categorically
would
not
do
so.
and
even
if
it
were
proven
that
the
effect
of
that
was
inordinately
to
disfavor
blacks,
that
would
not
be
a
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
you're
saying.3--
justice
antonin
scalia
--why
don't
you
start
saying
yes
or
no,
and
then
explain
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
i
was
going
to
ask
you
whether
you
think
the
probationers--
justice
antonin
scalia
we
have...
speaking
of
what
the
courts
based
their
finding
on,
the
court
of
appeals
found
that
there
was
no
proper
representative
for
the
probationers
anyway.
so
do
we
still
have
to
worry
about
the
probationer?
justice
antonin
scalia
not
for
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
were?
justice
antonin
scalia
were
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
wasn't
the
your
opponent
that
handed
you
that
note,
was
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
we've
said
that
when
a
racial
classification
of
people
is
drawn.
we've
never
said
it
to
a
racial
classification
of
arguments.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
it's
one
thing
to
discriminate
against...
against
a
race
of
people.
it's
another
thing
to
discriminate
against
a
racial
argument,
and
to
say,
i
don't
like
to
argue
on
the
basis
of
race
discrimination;
i
have
better
arguments.
that's
not
race
discrimination.
its
racial
argument
discrimination.
justice

below
a
disparate...
disparate
treatment
argument?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
never
mind
what
they
did.
did
you
seek
to
make
a
disparate
impact
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
had
filed
none
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
the
only
grievance
you
have
is
racial,
we
will
not
grieve
this
matter
at
all?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
what
i
asked
you.

justice
antonin
scalia
sorry
to
interrupt
you,
but
i
have
a
question
that
you
may
not
get
to,
and
you've
argued
this
in
your
brief.
and
this
other
question,
i
don't
think
i'll
get
it
out
of
your
brief.
you've
referred
several
times
to
the
failure
to
grieve
racial
harrassment
claims
and
to
do
anything
about
that.
now,
my
understanding
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
vacated
the
district
court's
determination
against
the
employer
with
regard
to
racial
harrassment.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
so,
why
doesn't
that
automatically
take
racial
harrassment
out
of
the
case
for
the
union
as
well?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
how
can
you
find
that
there
was
no
racial
harrassment,
but
blame
the
union
for
failing
to
grieve
racial
harrassment?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
they
admit
that
even
when
the
only
basis
for
the
claim
was
a
racial
one,
they
wouldn't
grieve
it?
i
thought
they
only
admitted
that
they
wouldn't...
that
they
wouldn't
include
that
in
the
other
matters
that
they...
that
they
grieved.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
talking
about
its
finding.
i'm
talking
about
the
admission
of
the
union
that
you
just
referred
to.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say
that
the
union
admitted
that
they
wouldn't
bring
harrassment
claims.
and
my
understanding
is
that
they
only
admitted
that
they
would
not
bring
racial
claims
when
there
were
other
claims
available
to
grieve
the
action
that
had
been
taken.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
understand
them
to
have
admitted
that
they
would
not
bring
a
harrassment
claim
if
that
was
the
only
thing
available.
