mr.
william
h.
ewing
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
let
me...
i
would
first
like
to
address
the
issues
raised
by
the
union's
cert
petition
on
their
liability,
and
then
go
on
to
the
issues
raised
by
our
cert
petition
on
the
statute
of
limitations.
and
let
me
start
off
just
by
elaborating
a
little
for
justice
scalia's
benefit
on
the
reasoning
of
the
court
of
appeals,
because
prima
facie,
it
sounds
quite
puzzling.
the
plaintiffs
had
contended
that
there
was
discrimination
in
discharges,
generally.
and
several
of
the
named
plaintiffs
had
been
discharged
by
lukens.
on
examining
the
evidence,
the
district
court
found
that
he
couldn't
find
discrimination
generally
in
discharges,
but
in
discharges
with
respect
to
probationary
employees,
he
did
find
discrimination.
and
since
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
since
the
issue
was
presented
legitimately
by
plaintiffs
who
had
the
right...
standing
to
present
the
issue
of
discrimination
in
discharges,
that
satisfied
that
standing
problem
on
that
subissue
of
probationary
discharges.
our...
our
argument
on
union
liability
has
three
basic
points.
first,
we
disagree
in
the
strongest
terms
with
the
union's
position
that
the
district
court
did
not
find
discrimination
in
the
handling
of
grievances.
the
district
court
did
find
that
the
unions
had
discriminated
on
the
ground
of
race
by
intentionally
showing
reluctance
to
file
grievances
alleging
racial
discrimination
under
the
racial
discrimination
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement;
a
reluctance
which
was
not
shown
with
respect
to
the
other
provisions
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
no.
well,
yes,
in
the
sense
that
the
district
court
want
into
a
considerable
dicussion
of
the
intent
which
was
necessary
to
find
a
violation
of
1981,
and
including
the
term
"racial
animus",
and
then
it
said
that
the
unions
had...
had
intentionally
refused
to
file
these
grievances.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
that's
right.
and
any
time...
this
court
has
held--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--well,
this
court
has
held
that
anytime
a
racial
classification
is
drawn,
that...
that
the
necessary
intent,
the
necessary
racial
animus
is
found.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
yes,
your
honor,
in
the--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--in
hunter
v.
ericson
and
washington
v.
seattle
school
district
no.
1,
this
court
held
that
racial...
classification
of
racial
issues,
racial
matters,
differently
from
other
matters
in
the
same
area
is
a
racial
classification.
there,
as
you
recall,
in
the
hunter
v.
ericson
case,
the
city
of
akron
had
passed
a
charter
amendment
that
suspended
the
fair
housing
ordinance,
and
said
that
in
order
to
adopt
a
new
fair
housing
ordinance,
there
would
have
to
be
a
plebiscite.
and
this
court
held
that
even
though
akron
wasn't
required
to
have
a
fair
housing
ordinance,
its
treating
fair
housing
as
an
issue
differently
from
other
regulation
of
real
estate
transactions
violated
the
fourteenth
amendment,
the
equal
protection
clause.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
the
district
court
found
the
union
to
have
the
intent
to
treat
violations
of
the
nondiscrimination
clause
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement
differently
from
other
clauses
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
well,
it
suggests
it.
in
the
paragraph
that
began
saying
that
the
situation
that
is
here
is
far
more
than
one
of
mere
passivity,
it
went
on
to
suggest
that
the
reason
was
either
that
it
wanted
to
avoid
antagonizing
its
white
members,
or
wanted
to
increase
its
chance
of
success
in
grievances
with
the
employer
on
other
issues.
but
it's
our
position,
and
i
feel
very
strongly
that
this
court's
decisions
uphold
it,
discrimination
is
defined
as
making
a
difference
in
treatment.
intentional
discrimination
is
making
an
intentional
difference
in
treatment.
and
if
you
draw
a
racial
classification,
and
you
treat
people
differently
on
the
basis
of
the
racial
classification,
then
that
is
intentional
discrimination
under
this
court's
decisions.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
yes,
your
honor,
just
as
in
palmore
v.
sadatti,
this
court
struck
down
a
decision
of
a
florida
court
removing
a
white
child
from
the
custody
of
her
mother
because
the
mother
had
married
a
black
man.
and
this
court
said,
we
recognize
what
the...
the
reason
the
florida
court
gave,
that
there's
a
social
stigma
attached
to
interracial
families,
but
that
doesn't
justify
creating
a
racial
classification.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
with
the
employer,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
well,
the
district
court
found
here
that
both
the
union
and
the
employer
avoided
addressing
the
discrimination
claims
of
the
employees.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
that's
true.
that's
true,
your
honor.
but
we
still
have
the
situation
here
that
they
carried
out
a
similar
course
of
conduct
which
resulted
in
perpetuating
a
discriminatory
environment
where
crosses
were
burned,
people
wore
kkk
armbands
to
work,
racially
derogatory
grafitti
appeared
throughout
the
plant.
the...
i
think...
back
to
justice
stevens'
question
about
whether
the
motive
matters,
if
a
real
estate
broker
has
black
customers,
and
in
showing
them
houses,
decides
to
avoid
certain
white
neighborhoods,
why,
because
he's
found
from
experience
that
if
shows
black
homebuyers
houses
in
those
neighborhoods,
the
houses
are
suddenly
taken
off
the
market,
or
maybe
violence
results.
and
so
he
just
doesn't
show
them
to
the
black
homebuyers.
he
finds
them
houses
in
other
neighborhoods,
integrated
neighborhoods,
black
neighborhoods,
maybe
other
white
neighborhoods
that
are
more
progressive.
the
results
for
the
customers
may
be
as
good
in
terms
of
they
find
houses
they're
satisfied
with,
but
it
seems
to
me
there's
still
been
discrimination
by
the
broker.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
no,
i
was
just--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--in
the
example
i
gave
with
the
real
estate
brokers?
mr.
william
h.
ewing
no,
i
was
only
looking
at
the
motive
question
there.
o--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--whether
the
motive
was
relevant.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
but
here
there
is
still
discrimination.
when
they
process
some
claims,
they
process
all
their
claims.
they
filed
8,000...
more
than
8,000
grievances.
that's
a
ratio
of
almost
two
a
day.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
under
(c)(1).
mr.
william
h.
ewing
that
is
discrimination.
the
union
may
not
discriminate.
here,
the
union
discriminated
between--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
the
union
treated
members
complaints
of
employer
discrimination
differently
from
the
way
it
treated
other
member
complaints.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
primarily
a
disparate
treatment
argument.
they
really
overlap.
we
show
that
the
union
treated
the
claims
differently,
the
claims
of
discrimination
differently
from
other
claims;
and
that
this
had
a
disparate
impact
also.
because
the
district
court
found
that
this
perpetuated
the
discriminatory
environment.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
not
in...
not
in
statistics,
your
honor,
at
least
is
against
the
union.
so--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--it's
hard--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--we
did
not
draw
that
distinction.
we
put
on
evidence
of--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--primarily
on
disparate
treatment,
your
honor.
i
think
that
the
government
and
the
unions
were
wrong
when
they
say
we
did
not
prove
disparate
impact.
because
we
did
prove--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
there
was,
because
the
district
court
found--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--yes,
your
honor.
on
page...
the
union
petitioner's
appendix,
page
138a,
the
district
court
stated:
the
clear
preference
of
both
the
company
and
the
unions
to
avoid
addressing
racial
issues
served
to
perpetuate
the
discriminatory
environment.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
the
court
of
appeals
said
that.
but
then
they
went
on--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--we
believe
that's
correct,
but
that
is
not
necessary
to
the
decision
of
this
case.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
because
what
the
district
court
found
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed,
both
of
them
said,
this
is...
what
we
have
here
is
something
very
different
from
mere
passivity.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
yes,
your
honor.
as
long
as
you
affirm
the
court
of
appeals
on
this
issue.
the...
on
the...
on
the
issues
of
probationary
employees
and
the
testing,
the
unions
made
a
lot
of
their
argument
that,
well,
they
grieved
testing
on
the
grounds
of
job
relatedness
rather
than
violation
of
the
discrimination
clause.
but
in
fact,
until
at
least
a
year
or
more
after
this
case
was
filed,
from
the
beginning
of
the
limitations
period,
the
union
had
filed
only
one
grievance
over
testing
on
job
relatedness
ground
either;
and
that
was
over
a
whole
battery
of
tests.
so
during
the
years,
except
for
that
one
grievance
when
they
were
manning
a
new
facility,
when
the
employer
was
manning
a
new
facility,
during
the
years
when
the
wunderlicht
test
was
in
common
use
by
the
employer,
day-to-day
use,
the
unions
did
not
grieve
that,
either
on
job
relatedness
ground
or
on
discrimination
grounds.
similarly
with
respect
to
probationary
discharges,
the
union
said,
well,
we
didn't
grieve
probationary
discharges;
that's
across
the
board.
but
the
only
ground
on
which
they
could
have
grieved
probationary
discharges
was
discrimination,
because
otherwise
the
employer
had
full
discretion
to
discharge
employees
during
the
probationary
period.
so
their
failure
to
grieve
probationary
discharges
is
seen
as
just
another
aspect
of
their
reluctance
and
almost
total
failure
to
grieve
discrimination
in
any
aspect.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
oh,
no,
about
half
of
the
people
discharged
during
the
probationary
period
were
white.
it
was...
blacks
were
over
50
percent;
whereas
they
were
about
a
third
of
those
hired,
they
were
more
than
half
of
those
discharged.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
not
that
i'm
aware
of,
your
honor.
but
the
only
ground
on
which
they
could
grieve
probationary
discharges
was
discrimination;
because
otherwise
the
employer
had--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--that's
right.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
the
contract
gave
basically
no
seniority
rights--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--and
no
rights
with
respect
to
discharge.
presumably,
if
a
probationary
employee
worked
overtime
and
wasn't
paid
overtime,
yes,
there
would
have
been
a
violation
of
the
contract
that
could
have
been
grieved
on
behalf
of
the
probationary
employee.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
the
district
court
found
that.
now,
that
was
stated
both
in
the
testimony
and
in
the
district
court's
findings,
in
the
context
of
a
question
about
grievances
over
discharges
of
probationary
employees.
but
even
aside
from
that,
the
union
claimed
to
have...
claimed
to
give
priority
to
discharges,
to
grievances
over
discharges
and
suspensions.
so
that
if...
when
probationary
employees
were
discharged,
that
was
a
different
kind
of
situation
from
whatever
other
minor
grievances
probationary
employees
might
have.
and
even
though
they
claimed
to
give
priority
to...
to
grievances
over
discharge
and
suspensions,
they
didn't
give
any
priority,
they
didn't
grieve
probationary
discharges,
which
they
could
have
only
grieved
on
account
of
race.
the
union
is
just
wrong
when
they
say
that
the
district
court
found
that
there
was
no
discrimination
in
the
grievance
handling
process.
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
once
grievances
were
filed,
and
moving
up
into
the
second,
third
step,
arbitration
and
so
on,
that
it
could
not
find
that
grievances
of
black
employees
were
treated
differently
from
grievances
of
white
employees.
but
then
it
went
on
to
say,
plaintiffs
are
on
firmer
ground,
however,
with
respect
to
their
complaint
that
the
unions
discriminated
by
failing
to
grieve
discrimination
claims.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
if...
in
the
case
of
a
discharge--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--no,
in
the
case
of
a
discharge,
the
union
would
grieve
it.
but
they
would
not
put
in,
because
of
race,
by
and
large.
there
were
a
few
cases
where
they
did
put
it
in,
but
by
and
large
it
was
admitted
they
were
reluctant.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
basically,
what
the
district
court
found
was
that
they
were
reluctant
to
file
racial
discrimination
grievances.
they
avoided
it
wherever
possible.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
yes,
there
are,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
yes.
and...
and
more
instances--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
he...
he
found
that
their--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--i
don't
know
whether...
well,
yes--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--the
district
court
found
that
because...
the
union's
position
that
it
would
grieve
on
other
grounds
where
it
could
failed
to
take
account
of
the
numerous
instances
of
racial
harrassment
where
there
were
no
other
grounds
on
which
to
grieve.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
in
a
particular
case,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
the
district
court--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--well,
i
wasn't
sure
whether
your
question--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--yes,
your
honor.
but
the
district
court
didn't
specify
those
cases
in
its
opinion,
but
they
are
in
the
record.
yes,
i
believe
there
are.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
i
beg
your
pardon,
justice
marshall?
mr.
william
h.
ewing
well,
yes
your
honor.
the
district
court
rejected
the
union's
claim
that
the
reason
they
didn't
file
discrimination
claims
was
because
they
could
get
better
results
by
other
means.
and
he
said,
i
find
this
explanation
unacceptable.
in
the
first
place,
it
overlooks
the
numerous
instances
of
harrassment
which
were
indisputably
racial
in
nature,
but
which
did
not
otherwise
plainly
violate
a
provision
of
the
collective
bargaining
agreement.
thus,
grievances
involving
no
loss
of
pay
or
permanent
disciplinary
record
were
virtually
ignored.
this
is
on
page
138a
of
the
union's
petitioners'
appendix.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
that's
a
finding.
and
then
he
says,
in
the
second
place,
it
seems
obvious
the
vigorous
pursuit
of
claims
of
racial
discrimination
would
have
focussed
attention
upon
racial
issues
and
compelled
some
change
in
racial
attitudes.
and
goes
on
to
say
that
the...
that
the
employer's
failure
to...
or
that
the
union's
failure
to
grieve
racial
discrimination
served
to
perpetuate
the
discriminatory
environment.
if
the
court
please,
i
would
like
to
go
on
to
the
statute
of
limitations
question
briefly.
wilson
v.
garcia
had
three
holdings.
first,
42
usc
section
1988
provides
that...
or
requires
that
federal
law
govern
the
characterization
of
claims
for
violations
of
civil
rights
acts
for
the
statute
of
limitations
purposes.
second,
that
under
section
1988,
instead
of
looking
at
the
allegations
in
each
individual
case,
the
court
should
look
at
the
history
and
purpose
of
the
statute
in
question
and
select
the
one
most
appropriate
characterization
for
all
actions
under
that
statute.
and
third,
following
one
and
two,
that
the
most
appropriate
characterization
for
claims
under
section
1983,
is
claims
for
personal
injury.
now
on
the
union's
claim,
let
me
just
look
at
the
issue
of
retroactivity,
because
i
suspect
i
won't
get
through--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
william
h.
ewing
well,
in
the
first
place,
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed
the
district...
all
of
the
district
court's
findings
against
the
union.
so
obviously,
they
didn't
think
that
it
had
that
effect.
mr.
william

no,
what
the...
what
the
court
of
appeals
found
was
that
on
the...
not
that
there
was
no
racial
harrassment,
but
that
on
the
evidence
remaining,
once
they
reduce
the
limitations
period,
there
was
not
sufficient
evidence
that
the
employer
tolerated
racial
harrassment.
it's
the
toleration
of
racial
harrassment
by
the
employer
which
constitutes
the
violation
of
title
vii
in
section
1981.
and
the
reason
it
found
that
was
that
when
you...
there
were...
we
proved
toleration
of
racial
harrassment
through
anecdotal
testimony
about
many
instances
where
the
employer
was...
there
were
complaints
made
to
the
employer
about
racial
harrassment,
and
they
didn't
do
anything.
or
they
even...
it
was
supervisory
employees,
and
they
even
in
a
way,
somehow,
endorsed
it.
with
respect
to
the
unions,
however,
the
complaints
were
made
to
the
unions.
the
unions
admitted
that
they
have
a
policy
of
treating
complaints
about
racial
matters
differently
from
other
complaints.
and
therefore
it
is
not
necessary
to
build
up
this
accumulation
of
instances
where
they
tolerated
racial
harrassment.
mr.

no,
there
is
no...
no
such
limitation
on
the
district
court's
finding.

--the...
the
testimony--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--the
testimony--
mr.
william
h.
ewing
--the
testimony
supports
the
district
court's
finding
that
the
union
was
reluctant
to,
and
avoided
submitting
racial
discrimination
grievances.
and
neither
the
testimony
nor
the
district
court's
finding
is
limited
to
situations
where
there
were
other
grounds
to
pin
the
grievances
on.
mr.

thank
you.
