mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
this
is
a
class
action
employment
discrimination
case
brought
pursuant
to
title
vii
of
the
civil
rights
act
of
1964,
and
42
usc
section
1981.
the
defendants
in
the
case
were
the
employer,
lukens
steel
company,
and
united
steelworkers
of
america
and
two
of
its
locals.
in
the
courts
below,
plaintiffs
prevailed
on
some
but
not
all
of
their
claims
against
the
employer,
and
on
one
of
three
claims
against
the
union.
the
unions
and
the
plaintiffs
both
petitioned
this
court.
both
petitions
were
granted.
and
they've
been
consolidated
for
this
argument.
the
question
presented
by
the
union's
petition
is
whether
either
title
vii
or
section
1981
imposes
on
unions
an
affirmative
duty
to
combat
employer
discrimination.
the
question
presented
by
the
plaintiffs'
petition
is,
what
statute
of
limitations
should
apply
to
the
1981
claims...
to
the
section
1981
claims
in
this
case.
i
plan
to
devote
my
opening
argument
to
the
issue
raised
in
the
union's
petition,
the
affirmative
duty
issue.
my
presentation
will
be
in
two
parts.
i
will
discuss
our
legal
position,
which
is
quite
straightforward.
basically,
our
position
is
that
the
only
duty
that
title
vii
imposes
on
unions
with
respect
to
employer
discrimination
is
the
duty
not
to
cause
or
attempt
to
cause
that
discrimination.
that's
the
duty
stated
in
section
703(c)(3)
of
title
vii.
that
provision
leaves
no
room
for
any
affirmative
duty
on
the
part
of
the
unions
to
combat
employer
discrimination.
likewise
as
to
section
1981,
this
court
has
already
held
in
general
building
contractors,
that
the
only
duty
that
section
1981
imposes
is
the
duty
not
to
engage
in
intention
discrimination.
section
1981
does
not
impose
a
duty
on
any
party
to
combat
discrimination
by
another
party.
to
interpret
either
of
these
statutes
to
place
the
affirmative
duty
on
unions
to
combat
employer
discrimination
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
role
of
unions
as
set
forth
under
our
system
of
labor
relations
set
up
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
before
i
elaborate
on
these
points,
i
want
to
address
another
matter.
plaintiffs
who
pleaded
and
tried
this
case
on
the
theory
of
an
affirmative
duty
to
combat
employer
discrimination;
who
argued
the
case
to
the
court
of
appeals
on
that
theory,
now
say
that
this
case
doesn't
raise
the
issue.
plaintiffs
are
wrong
about
that,
but
i
think
it's
worth
taking
a
few
minutes
to
demonstrate
why
they're
wrong,
because
in
the
process
the
legal
issues
here
will
be
focussed.
plaintiffs'
complaint
asserted
three
claims
against
the
unions.
two
of
the
claims
were
claims
that
the
unions
themselves
had
discriminated.
one
claim
was
that
the
unions
had
adopted
and
maintained
a
discriminatory
seniority
system;
the
other
was
that
the
unions
discriminated
in
processing
grievances.
the
district
court
found
for
the
union
on
both
of
those
claims.
the
third
claim
that
was
in
plaintiffs'
complaint
was
based
on
the
affirmative
duty
theory.
in
the
words
of
the
complaint,
the
unions,
quote,
failed
to
act
affirmatively
to
cause
the
employer
to
refrain
from
discriminating
against
black
employees
because
of
their
race
and
color.
it
was
on
this
theory
that
the
district
court
found
the
unions
liable.
and
in
so
finding,
the
district
court
did
not
find
that
the
unions
failed
generally
to
oppose
employer
discrimination.
the
findings
of
the
district
court
and
the
record
are
clear
that
the
unions
made
many
such
efforts,
and
many
were
successful.
the
court
below
based
the
finding
of
liability
on
this
case
on
a
narrower
failure
on
the
unions'
part,
and
that
is
the
repeated
failure
to
assert
racial
discrimination
as
a
ground
for
grievances.
it
was
that
failure
that
was
the
breach
of
the
affirmative
duty
found
by
the
district
court.
in
this
regard,
it's
very
significant
that
the
court
did
not
find
that
the
unions'
failure
was
motivated
by
racial...
was
racially
motivated.
it
did
not
find
that
the
unions
were
giving
inferior
treatment
to
black
employees
as
opposed
to
white
employees.
and
it
did
not
find
that
the
unions'
failure
to
raise
race
discrimination
as
a
ground
for
grievances
was
a
racial
classification.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
your
honor--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--the
third
circuit,
your
honor,
had
a
sentence
which
said
that
the
unions'
conduct
here
violated
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
this
case
was
not...
that
was
not
one
of
the
bases
for
the
complaint
in
this
case,
which
was
brought
only
on
title
vii
and
on
section
1981,
so
it's
not
clear
why
the
district
court
found
that.
i
think--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--your
honor,
you
don't
have
to
deal
with
it
as
a
theory.
but
i
think
it's
useful...
because
it's
not
raised
in
the
case...
but
i
think
it
is
useful
to
understand.
it's
part
of
the
general
context
for
this
case,
why
it
is
that
what
the
union
did
is
not
a
breach
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
duty
of
fair
representation
does
not
tell
unions
what
their
priority
should
be
or
what
their
tactics
should
be.
it
doesn't
dictate
any
substantive
position.
what
the
duty
of
fair
representation
says
is,
whatever
you
do
with
respect
to
your
members,
because
you
have
this
exclusive
authority
to
act
on
their
behalf,
you
have
to
do
it
without
improper
motivation.
you
cannot
be
discriminatory.
you
cannot
be
arbitrary.
and
you
cannot
act
in
bad
faith.
so
that
if
unions
are
taking
actions
which
aren't
discriminatory,
arbitrary,
or
in
bad
faith,
but
are
in
fact
based
on
some
other
ground,
the
duty
of
fair
representation
does
not
come
into
play.
and
so--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--your
honor,
i
think
it
did.
but
i
think
you've
got
to...
and
i
think
now
is
as
good
a
time
as
any
to
do
that...
i
think
you've
got
to
focus
on
the
various
practices.
because
it
in
effect
made
findings
with
respect
to
each
of
the
practices
it
found
the
unions
liable
for.
and
i
think
it's
very
helpful
in
looking
at
those
findings,
because
it
not
only
shows
that
this
case
is
in
fact
an
affirmative
duty
case,
but
it
shows
that
what
the
affirmative
duty
reduces
to
in
practice
is
judicial
second
guessing
of
unions
tactics
and
union
priorities.
i
think
the
basic
finding
that
the
union...
that
the
court,
district
court,
made
was
that
the
union,
when
there
was
another
ground
available
for
a
grievance,
would
base
the
grievance
on
that
other
ground,
and
not
on
the
ground
of
race
discrimination.
but
the
court
recognized
that
the
unions'
reluctance
to
do
that...
and
it
was
a
reluctance,
because
the
unions
did,
in
a
number
of
instances,
make
claims
of
race
discrimination
and
grievances...
but
the
court
recognized
that
the
unions'
reluctance
was
for
tactical
reasons,
not
for
racial
reasons.
for
example,
if
a
black
employee
were
laid
off,
and
a
junior
white
was
kept
on
the
same
job,
the
black
employee
would
have
a
very
solid
seniority
grievance.
the
layoff
is
out
of
order,
and
he
was
entitled
to
keep
the
job
on
a
seniority
basis.
to
add
race
discrimination,
a
claim
in
that
instance,
would
be
of
no
help
to
the
grievant.
if
he's
senior,
he'll
win;
if
he's
not
senior,
he'll
lose.
but
in
addition,
and
the
court
found
that
the
union...
this
was
the
union's
perception.
there
were...
there
may
be
disadvantages
to
the
grievant
to
raise
race
discrimination
in
a
claim
like
that.
it's
difficult
to
prove
race
discrimination
as
this
case
illustrates.
alleging
race
discrimination
when
you've
already
got
a
solid
objective
ground
like
seniority
may
well
tend
to
complicate
and
delay
resolution
of
the
grievance.
and
in
addition,
as
the
court
found,
it
was
the
union
perception
that
raising
race
discrimination
made
it
more
difficult
to
settle
individual
claims
with
the
company.
these
considerations
were
testified
to
by
black
and
white
grievance
men,
including
a
number
of
plaintiffs'
witnesses...
excuse
me...
and
the
court
accepted
these
reasons
as
the
reasons
for
the
unions'
reluctance.
indeed,
the
court
found
that
by
pursuing
this
approach,
the
unions
had
been
successful
in
combatting
employer
discrimination
in
a
number
of
areas.
i
won't
quote
it
here,
but
at
page
93a
of
the...
of
the
petition
appendix
in
85-2010,
the
court
goes
into
great
detail
about
how
pressing
grievances
on
objective
contract
ground
in
fact
successfully
combatted
employer
discrimination
in
a
number
of
areas
where
plaintiffs
had
brought
claims.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
well,
adding
the
second
factor--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--i
would
agree,
your
honor,
that
if...
well,
if
a
union
decides
not
to
process
race
discrimination
claims
for
racial
reasons,
for
racial
animus,
then
that
is
clearly
a
grievance.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
your
honor,
i
think...
i
don't
think
it
could
be
inferred
from
that
fact
alone.
certainly
in
a
case
where
the
reasons
are
apparent
why
they
didn't
do
it,
any
such
inference
would
in
any
event
be
overcome.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
the
district
court
found
that
the
union
had
not
discriminated
in
processing
grievances;
that
blacks
and
whites
were
treated
alike.
and
there
is
no
finding
anywhere
that
blacks
got
inferior
treatment.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
finding
that
in
a
number...
as
the
court
said,
in
repeated
instances,
when
a
black
grievant
came
to
the
union
with
a
complaint,
a
seniority
complaint,
an
overtime
complaint,
a
shift
differential
complaint,
and
he
said
to
the
union,
i
think
that
the
reason
i
didn't
get
what
i
should
have
gotten
is
because
of
race
discrimination,
there
is
a
finding
by
the
district
court
that
the
unions
in
that
case,
when
they
had
this
other
ground,
were
reluctant
to
allege
race
discrimination.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
your
honor,
there
is...
there
is...
there
are
a
couple
of
instances
where
there
was
not
another
ground,
and
i
think
you
have
to
deal
with
those
separately.
one
of
those
was
probationary--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
i
don't
think
the
court
found
one
way
or
the
other,
but
there
are
documents
in
the
records
which
are
grievances...
which
are
racial
grievances.
and
so
that
the
record--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--your
honor,
i
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
did
affirm
on
the
basis
that
the
district
court
used.
the
court
of
appeals
through
in
some...
some
other
references.
but
i
think
its
analysis
was
the
same.
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
gravamen
of
the
wrong
here
was
that
the
union
had
failed
to
assert
race
discrimination
as
a
basis
for
grievances.
and
the
court
of
appeals,
as
did
the
district
court,
said
that
there
was
more
than
just
a
failure,
that
it
was
an
intentional
failure,
because
the
unions
knew
that
there
was
employer
discrimination,
and
failed...
and
failed
to
raise
discrimination
in
grievances.
the
court
of
appeals
took
that
finding
and
put
some
labels
on
it
that
the
district
court
did
not
put
on
it,
but
i
think
the
issue
remains
the
same.
the
court,
for
example,
as
justice
o'connor
stated,
called
it
a
violation
of
the
duty
of
fair
representation.
the
court
said
it
was
a
violation
of
section
703(c)(1).
but
i
think
those
are
just
labels.
i
don't
think
the
court
was
seeing
the
case
differently
or
characterizing
the
case
differently
than
the
district
court
had.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
i
think
it
certainly
would
not,
your
honor.
in
fact,
one
of
the...
one
of
the
claims
in
this
case
borders
on
that...
on
that
rationale.
the
court
found
that
the
unions
did
object
to
the
company's
tests
of
all
kinds.
but
the
court
faulted
the
union
because
the
union's
grievances
against
the
company's
tests
were
not
based
on
race
discrimination,
they
were
based
on
an
independent
ground
in
the
contract,
and
that
is,
the
job
relatedness
ground.
under
the
union's
contract,
unlike
title
vii,
if
a
test
is
not
job
related,
then
it's
invalid.
the
union
had
gone
on
that
ground.
the
director
of
arbitration
for
the
union,
the
international
union,
testified
to
why
the
union
had
done
that.
it
was
already...
those
grievances
were
already
were
so
incredibly
complicated
that
they
were
processed
out
of
the
international
union
arbitration
department,
and
not
out
of
the
local
union
by
local
union
people.
proving
job
relatedness
required
all
kinds
of
expert
testimony,
and
technical
knowledge
and
expertise.
to
add
the
second
ground,
and
that
is,
which
would
not
be
necessary
if
the
union
prevailed
on
the
job
relatedness
ground,
to
add
the
second
ground
of
race
discrimination
would
add
a
whole
other
layer
of
complication.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
your
honor,
the
testimony
was
that
it
was
not.
but
there
are
a
couple
of
other
factors.
one,
it
was
absolutely
clear
that
if
it
was
not
job
related,
the
test
would
be
struck
down.
it
was
not
so
clear
if
the...
if
the
test
was...
had
a
disparate
impact
but
was
job
related
what
would
occur.
the
union
would
argue
that
in
that
event,
the
test
would
be
struck
down,
but
it's
not
clear
that
that
would
be
the
case.
but
second
of
all,
one
of
the
union's
objectives
was
to
strike
the
test
down
for
everybody.
if
the
union
won
on
the
job
relatedness
test,
then
the
test
was
struck
down
for
everyone.
it
was
not
clear
what
would
happen
if
the
union
were
successful
in
striking
the
test
down
just
on
the
racial
discrimination
grounds.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
your
honor,
there
was
no
such
finding
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
your
honor,
there
would
be
a
threshold
question,
and
that
is
that...
i
guess
there'd
be
two
threshold
questions.
the
first
is
that
703(c)(2),
which
would
be
the
disparate
impact
section,
we
believe
is
addressed
to
situations
where
you
have
a
union
that
controls
access
to
jobs,
a
hiring
hall,
or
some
other
union
that
actually
controls
job
opportunities;
and
that
that
disparate
impact
section
does
not
apply
to
the
kinds
of
union
representation
that
goes
on
in
this
kind
of
an
industrial
union
setting.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
there
is
not.
i
don't
think
the
issue
is
resolved
one
way
or
the
other.
the
second
point
is--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--no,
there
was
no
claim.
that
claim--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--no,
there's
a
title
vii
claim,
but
there
was
no
claim
that
the
unions
had...
had
violated
title
vii
by
having
a
policy
which
had
a
disparate
impact.
there
was
no
finding,
and
there
was
no
claim.
i
want
to
add,
because
i
think
this
is
very
important,
that
where
the
disparate
impact
really
results
from
the...
from
employer
discrimination,
where
you
have
a
policy
that
the
union
is
applying,
and
the...
and
it
has
an
impact
that's
negative
on
blacks,
because
in
fact
employers
are
discriminating,
and
it
doesn't
successfully
combat
that,
then
i
think
there's
no
room
for
the
disparate
impact
theory,
even
if
i
was
wrong
about
my
first
point.
and
that
is
because
i
don't
think
the
disparate
impact
was
meant
to
be
a
basis
for
holding
one
party
liable
for
another
party's
intentional
discrimination.
the
party
to
sue
for
that
discrimination
would
be
the
party
committing
it.
and
that
is
confirmed
in
the
case
of
unions
by
section
703(c)(3).
section
703(c)(3)
states
the
exclusive
ground
for
holding
a
union
liable
for
employer
discrimination.
it
says
that...
the
first
two
subsections
of
703(c)
talk
about
discriminatory
conduct
of
a
union
within
itself.
section
703(c)(3)
is
addressed
to
union
responsibility
for
employer
conduct.
and
it
says
that
a
union
can
be
held
liable
for
employer
discrimination
if
the
union
causes
or
attempts
to
cause
that
discrimination.
and
i
think
that
any
interpretation
that
would
say
that
a
union
which
somehow
or
another
has
a
policy
which
doesn't
do
a
good
enough
job
of
combatting
employer
discrimination
is
a
disparate
impact
violation
i
think
would
be
inconsistent
with
that
section.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
your
honor--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--i
am
saying
that,
but
i
want
to
rephrase
that
a
little
bit.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
okay.
the
answer,
that
would
not
be
a
violation.
that
would
not
be
a
violation.
but
i
want
to
make
it
clear
what
we're
talking
about.
it
would
disfavor
blacks
in
the
sense
that
unions
would
not
be
doing...
taking
the
actions
which
would
be...
which
would
be
most
favorable
to
their
unique
interests.
it
is
different
from
giving
some
kind
of
inferior
treatment
to
blacks,
or
treating
them
in
a
discriminatory
manner.
i
want
to
get
to
the
probationary
employees.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
the
probationary
employees
is
a
different
situation
entirely.
there
the
court
found...
court
found
that
the
employer
was
discriminating
against
blacks
in
the
discharge
of
a
probationary
employee...
employees.
it
found
that
the
union
did
not
challenge
those
discharges.
but
it
also
found
why
the
union
didn't
challenge
those
discharges.
and
the
reason
that
the
court
found
was
not
a
discriminatory
one.
the
court
found
that
the
union,
having
this
tremendous
backload
of
grievances
that
were
unresolved,
didn't
process
any
kind
of
claim
for
probationary
employees
for
any
reason;
that
includes
the
whole
gamut
of
contract
claims
that
can
be
raised
for
a
probationary
employee,
and
would
affect
whites
as
well
as
blacks.
the
only
rights
that
are
limited
under
the
contract
for
probationary
employees
are
the
rights
upon
discharge,
which
are
limited
since
1974
to
discrimination
based--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--your
honor--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--it
is
clear
that
that
was
not...
in
order...
in
order
to
know
where
there
was
a
disparate
impact
on
blacks
because
of
the
union's
policy,
you
would
have
had
to
have
proved
a
lot
of
things
that
were
not
proved
in
the
trial
court.
you
would
have
to
prove
what...
assuming
for
the
moment
that
the
disparate
impact
theory
would
apply...
you
would
have
to
know
what
were
the
grievances
that
would
have
been
processed;
who
were
the...
what
were
the
claims;
who
had
the
claims;
and
did
in
fact
that
policy
have
a
disparate
impact
on
blacks.
because
probationary
discharges
were
just
one
of
hundreds
of
possible
claims
that
probationary
employees
could
have.
there
was
no
evidence
of
that.
and
there
was
no
evidence
on
another
point,
and
that
is,
that
race
discrimination
claims,
as
we've
already
alluded
to,
are
different
from
other
kinds
of
claims
under
the
contract.
and
you're
comparing
apples
and
oranges
when
you
talk
about
a
race
discrimination
claim
and
a
wage
claim
or
a
seniority
claim.
proving,
in
this
case,
to
prove
their
probationary
discharge
claim,
the
plaintiffs
brought
in
a
mass
of
statistical
and
anecdotal
evidence.
the
unions,
if
they
had
intended...
if
they
were
going
to
process
a
similar
kind
of
claim
would
have
had
to
do
time
same
kind
of
thing.
so
you're
not...
all
those
things
would
complicate
a
disparate
impact
analysis.
but
plaintiffs
made
no
effort
to
prove
that,
and
neither
court
based
its
findings
on
that,
and
i
think
the
issue
is
just
not
here.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
no,
no,
for
the
probationers
that's
not
correct.
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
proper
representative
for
the
initial
assignment
cases.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
well,
you
know,
i
say
that.
and
i
must
confess,
your
honor,
i
don't
recall
the
court
saying
there
was
no
proper
representative
for
probationary
employees.
but
it
would
almost
follow,
one
from
the
other,
because
the
reason
the
court
found
that
there
was
no
proper
representative
for
the
initial
assignment
claim
is
that
all
of
the
named
plaintiffs
had
been
working
at
the
plant
long
before
the
statute
of
limitations
in
this
period
began.
on
that
rationale,
they
would
be
the
same.
but
i
can't
say
at
this
moment
that
i
actually
recall
language
in
the
court's
opinion
saying
that.
in
fact,
a
note
was
just
passed
to
me
that
said,
the
court
of
appeals,
notwithstanding
the
lucid
argument
i
just
made,
said
that
probationers
were
represented.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
were,
yes.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
represented.
as
i've
already--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--it
was
not.
it
was
not.
if
the
court
please,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
yes,
your
honor.
with
particular
respect
to
the
racial
harrassment
claim,
number
one,
there
was
no
evidence
whatsoever
that
the
union
admitted,
quote,
to
treating...
to
not...
to
having
a
policy
of
not
raising
race
discrimination
when
there
was
no
other
grounds.
our
brief
is
full...
i
think
we
have
every
reference
in
the
joint
appendix,
which
is
every
reference
in
the
testimony,
to
where
the
policy,
if
you
could
call
it
that,
was
stated.
it
was
stated
as
often
by
plaintiffs'
witnesses
as
by
the
union's
witnesses,
and
in
every
case,
it
was
based
on
there
being
other
grounds
for
the
grievance.
second
of
all--
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
--there
is...
there
is
no
finding
that
i...
that
the
union
refused...
there
is
no
finding
that
the
union
refused
to
process
race
discrimination
grievances.
there
is
a
finding
that
they
were
reluctant
when
there
were
other
grounds.
the
court
said
that
that
rationale
wouldn't
apply
to
the
situation
of
racial
harrassment
where
there
was
no
loss
of
pay
or
no
discipline.
but
he
didn't
make
a
finding
that
the
union
in
fact
had
that
policy.
and
in
fact,
one
of
the
issues
we
would
have...
we
did
argue
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
which
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
reach,
because
it
vacated
the
racial
harrassment
finding,
was
that
in
the
entire
12-year
period,
only
13
instances
of
racial
harrassment
were
brought
to
the
union's
attention,
and
in
10
of
those
the
union
took
action.
and
i
want
to
add
one
other
thing,
because
the
evidence
is
also
very
clear
on
this.
the
union
had
another
means
to
take
care
of
racial
discrimination
problems
that
didn't
involve
other
contract
provisions.
the
contract
provided
for
a
joint
union-company
civil
rights
committee
which
was
ideally
suited
for
that
very
purposed,
to
take
care
of
problems
that
could
not
be
handled
through
the
grievance
process,
or
weren't
particularly
well
suited
for
that.
mr.
robert
m.
weinberg
thank
you.
