justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
mr.
ewing,
you're
giving
a
statutory
issue
here.
and
is
it
your
position...
i
want
to
be
sure
court
of
appeals
opinion
which
refers
to
a
union
which
intentionally
avoids
asserting
discrimination
claims,
either
so
as
not
to
antagonize
the
employer
and
have
desire
of
the
white
membership
is
liable
under
the
statute.
and
it's
your
position,
i
take
it,
under
the
statute,
it
doesn't
make
a
bit
of
difference
what
the
union's
reason
for
intentionally
avoiding
asserting
discrimination
claims
was,
even
if
the
union
could
prove
that
in
the
long
run
this
was
wise
union
policy
and
resulted
in
success
on
many,
many
other
grievances,
you
would
say
that's
still
a
per
se
violation
of
the
statute?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
wanted
to
be
sure
i
had
your
view.
let
me
also
answer
with
respect
to
making
a
constitutional
argument
on
a
statutory
claim.
this
court
has
pointed
out
in
steele
v.
louisville
&
nashville
railroad,
in
emporium
capwell
and
in
other
cases,
that
the
situation
of
a
union
is
similar
to
that
of
a
governmental
entity
with
respect
to
its
rights
and
responsibilities
to
its
members
regarding
equal
protection.
and
that
because
the
union
has
the
exclusive
bargaining
right
for
the
members,
therefore
it
has
an
equal
obligation...
i
think
in
steele
it
said
at
least
as
strong
an
obligation...
as
a
governmental
entity
to
treat
those
members
with
discrimination.
xxx
cases
the
two
were
working
together;
the
brotherhoods
were
working
with
the
employees
to
discriminate
against
negroes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
--you
may
be
entirely
right,
mr.
ewing.
the
only
point
that
i
had...
well,
two
points,
really.
one,
for
purposes
of
addressing
your
argument,
we
can
assume
the
motive
is
the
first
of
the
two
alternatives,
improving
chance
of
success
on
other
issues,
and
it
won't
weaken
your
argument
in
the
slightest.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
don't
have
to
assume
it
was
because
of
the
perceived
desires
of
the
white
majority.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
second
point,
though,
is
that
even
the
example
you
give
comes
within
different
statutory
language.
the
statutory
language
you
must
come
within
is
the
"cause
or
attempt
to
cause"
discrimination;
is
that
not
right?
at
least
with
respect
to
the
title
vii
requirement.
i
mean,
your
title
vii
claim
is
based
on
the
language
of
the
statute--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--or
you're
talking
about
1981.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
i
understand.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
not
relevant
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
let
me
say,
assume
i
agree
with
you,
that's
discrimination.
which
subsection
of
703(c)
does
that
discrimination
violate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
that's
(1),
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
exclude
or
expel
from
its
membership,
or
otherwise
to
discriminate
against
its
membership.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say
it
comes
in
under
"otherwise
discriminate";
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
you
say
the
contract
gave
the
probationers
no
rights
at
all?
because
i
understood
your
opponent
to
say
there
were
hundreds
of
grounds
for
grievances
on
behalf
of
probationers,
and
this
was
one
of
a
large
universe,
and
they
just
didn't
enforce
any
of
them.
which
is
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
did
it
give
any
rights
at
all?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
correct
that
the
district
court
found
the
union
had
a
uniform
policy
of
not
processing
any
of
these
grievances
for
probationers?
