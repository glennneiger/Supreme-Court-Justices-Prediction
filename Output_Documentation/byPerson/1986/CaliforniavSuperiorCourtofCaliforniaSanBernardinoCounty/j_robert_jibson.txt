mr.
j.
robert
jibson
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
before
the
court
in
this
case
is
whether
an
asylum
state
court
may
block
extradition
on
the
ground
that
the
person
is
not
charged
with
a
crime
because
that
court
concludes,
based
on
extrinsic
evidence,
that
the
person
is
innocent.
on
march
9th,
1984,
real
parties
in
interest,
gerard
and
richard
smolin
took
richard
smolin's
two
minor
children
from
his
school
bus
stop
in
slidell,
louisiana,
st.
tammany
parish,
and
removed
them
to
the
state
of
california.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
these
facts
are
from
the
record
of
the
record
of
the
habeas
corpus
hearing,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct.
at
the
time
of
the
abduction,
the
children
had
been
living
with
their
mother,
in
her
custody
for
three
years
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
three
days
after
the
abduction,
the
st.
tammany
parish
prosecutor
filed
simple
kidnapping
charges
against
gerard
and
richard
smolin.
and
their
extradition
from
the
state
of
california
was
sought.
two
months
later,
in
june
of
1984,
the
louisiana
governor
sent
a
requisition
to
the
governor
of
california,
requesting
the
extradition
of
the
smolin's.
after
two
more
months,
in
august
of
1984,
the
california
governor
granted
the
extradition
request
and
issued
his
warrant
for
the
rendition
of
the
smolin's.
however,
the
courts
of
california
have
now
blocked
the
extradition
on
the
basis
that
the
smolin's
are
not
actually
charged
with
a
crime.
they
reached
this
conclusion
only
after
the
habeas
corpus
courts
in
california
took
judicial
notice
of
some
other
california
court
records
containing
a
decree
which
gave
richard
smolin
custody
of
the
children.
essentially,
the
habeas
corpus
court
found
that
since,
in
light
of
that
decree
giving
mr.
smolin
custody,
he
could
not
be
found
guilty
in
the
state
of
louisiana;
therefore,
he
and
his
father
gerard
were
not
actually
charged
with
a
crime
in
louisiana.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no,
the
state
is
not
taking
that
position,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
the
habeas
corpus
court
may
inquire
into
four
very
narrow
areas,
your
honor.
two
of
those
are
factual,
and
two
of
those
are
legal.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
they
come
from
this
court's
case
in
michigan
v.
doran
in
1978,
your
honor.
the
factual
questions
that
may
be
inquired
into
in
habeas
corpus
are
number
1:
whether
the
person
before
the
court
is,
in
fact,
the
person
wanted
by
the
demanding
state.
question
of
identity
as
the
person
charged.
secondly,
whether
in
fact
he
is
a
fugitive
and
by
that
i
mean
a
legal
term
of
art
whether
he
was
in
the
state
at
the
time
the
alleged
offense
took
place.
and
thereafter,
is
found
in
another
state.
fugitivity
if
you
will.
those
two
factual
questions.
then
the
legal
questions
are
whether
the
extradition
papers
on
their
face
are
in
order
according
to
the--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--whether
they
meet--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--that
is
actually
the
fourth
inquiry,
your
honor.
the
facial
validity
of
the
papers--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--the
extradition--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
it
may
look
at
the
extradition
papers,
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that
inquiry,
it
is
our
contention,
is
limited
to
what
is
included
in
the
extradition
papers.
whether
they,
on
their
face,
state
the
charge
of
an
offense
in
the
demanding
state.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
the
papers
must
allege
that
it
is
a
crime
in
that
state.
that's
true.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no,
that
is
not
true,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
only
need
be
shown
that
the
crime
for
which
extradition
was
sought
is
a
crime
in
the
demanding
state.
it
doesn't
even
matter
if
it
is
a
crime
in
the
asylum
state
as
a
matter
of
fact.
the
criteria
is
whether
the
person
is
charged
under
the
law
of
the
demanding
state.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well
actually,
your
honor,
that
language
"under
the
law
of
the
demanding
state.
"
is
contained
in
the
uniform
criminal
extradition
act,
which
has
been
adopted
by
both
the
states
involved
here
as
well
as
all
other
states
with
the
exception
of
two.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no,
it
doesn't
say
that
explicitly,
your
honor.
the
courts--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--well,--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--that's
true.
that's
true.
and--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--it
is
our
position
that
you
look
at
the
face
of
the
documents
to
determine
whether
there
is
a
charge
there.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
the
face
of
the
affidavit's.
that's
right.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
it
is
our
contention
that
he
is
not
permitted
to
bring
to
bring
extraneous--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--that's
correct.
in
the
context
of
the
extradition
hearing
he
is
not
to
bring
in
extraneous
facts,
other
than
what
is
contained
in
the
four
corners
of
the
extradition
papers.
that's
true.
and
that
is
our
contention.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct
insofar
as
it
bears
upon
these
questions
of
law
which
are--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
it
appeared
to.
it
purported
to,
yes.
and
the
problem
that,
maybe
i
can
give
a
little--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--if
he
had
lawful
custody,
it
would
appear
that
he
has
got
a
defense
to
the
crime.
but
the
problem
with
going
beyond
the
face
of
the
documents
when
you're
inquiring
into
this
question
of
whether
the
person
is
substantially
charged
is
because
you
just
don't
know
what
else
is
out
there.
we
do
have
these
decrees
that
were
found
in
the
california
court
file,
but
as
i've
indicated
in
the
brief,
there
are
grounds
upon
which
those
can
be
disputed.
and,
in
fact,
the
louisiana
authorities
do
dispute
the
validity
of
those.
they're
aware
of
those
orders.
they
dispute
their
validity.
and
it's
my
position
that
the
extradition--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--what
was
crystal
clear
under
federal
law
and
i
don't
want
to
transform
this
into
a
custody
case,
but
what's
clear
under
federal
law
is
that
california
retained
modification
jurisdiction
over
the
original
order
which
gave
mrs.
pope
custody
of
the
children.
that
is
not
the
same,
i
submit,
as
to
whether
that
is
the
only
court
that
can
deal
with
the
custody
issue
regarding
these
children.
as
i
said
at
the
outset,
these
children
had
been
living
with
their
mother
for
three
years
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
they
had
established
home
state
jurisdiction
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
and,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
custody
proceedings
were
pending
in
louisiana
at
the
time
of
this
abduction.
now,
as
i
said,
there
are
areas
for
dispute
as
to
whether
or
not
ultimately,
mr.
smolin
had
custody
of
the
children.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
if
i--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--to
modify
the
decree,
that's
correct.
if
i
might
i
could
quote
just
a
brief
section
of
that
federal
act,
your
honor,
and
hopefully
this
will
help
to
answer
that
particular
question.
this
is
subdivision
g
of
1738(a).
a
court
of
a
state
shall
not
exercise
jurisdiction
in
any
proceeding
for
a
custody
determination
commenced
during
the
pendency
of
a
proceeding
in
a
court
of
another
state.
or
such
court
of
that
other
state
is
exercising
jurisdiction
consistent
with
the
provisions
of
this
section
to
make
custody
determinations.
just
one
ground
as
a
possible
means
of
attacking
this
particular
decree
that
mr.
smolin
is
relying
upon
would
be
that
there
were
pending
texas
proceedings
regarding
the
custody
of
these
children
at
the
time
he
went
in
to
the
california
court
to
get
the
custody
decree
modified
in
his
favor.
he
was
aware
of
those
texas
proceedings.
those
texas
proceedings
were
being
held
in
order
to
receive
a
full
faith
and
credit
recognition
of
the
original
california
order.
there
was
no
notice
to
the
california
court
when
mr.
simolin
went
in
to
get
his
modified
decree.
the
texas
proceedings
were
already
pending;
therefore,
there
would
be
a
violation
of
this
section
of
the
federal
act.
the
point
is,
in
these
custody
disputes
and
i'd
rather
get
back
to
the
extradition
issue,
but
in
these
custody
disputes
the
key
under
both
the
federal
act
and
the
uniform
child
custody
jurisdiction
act
is
communication
where
there
might
be
problems
with
concurrent
jurisdiction,
where
more
than
one
court
might
have
jurisdiction
over
the
custody
matters
involving
these
particular
children.
communication
did
not
occur
in
this
case;
therefore,
we
have
a
result
of
conflicting
custody
orders.
so,
the
point
of
all
this
is
that
it
was
not
that
cut
and
dried
that
he
could
not
be
charged.
this
actually
goes
to
the
merits
of
the
case
in
louisiana.
and,
of
course,
this
is
my
base
line
position
that
those
have
to
be
delved
into
only
where
the
charges
are
pending
out
in
the
asylum
state.
that
is
not
part
of
the
summary
executive
proceeding
that
we
call
extradition.
this
court
has
on
numerous
occasions
recognized
that
extradition
is
intended
to
be
a
summary
executive
proceeding
in
which
the
courts
of
the
asylum
state
play
an
extremely
limited
role.
in
michigan
v.
doran,
this
court
clearly
stated
that
a
court
of
an
asylum
state
can
do
no
more
than
decide
those
four
issues
that
i
enumerated
a
little
bit
earlier.
can
do
no
more
than.
it's
a
matter
of
power
of
the
courts.
this
court
indicated
that
asylum
state
courts
are
without
power
to
go
further
than
that.
and
i
submit
that
what
occurred
in
this
case
is
that
the
california
supreme
court.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
when
i
say,
no
power
to
go
beyond
those
four
inquiries,--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--i'm
relying
on
michigan
v.
doran.
this
court's
decision
xxx.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
which
was
based
on
the
extradition
clause
in
the
constitution
and
the
federal
extradition
act.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
the
uniform
act
was
promulgated
and
enacted
by
the
various
states
under
the
auspices
of
the
extradition
clause
and
it
supplements
it.
but
i'm
not
just
relying
on
the
ucea.
no,
your
honor.
as
this
court
made
clear
in
michigan
v.
doran,
these
are
requirements
that
are
dictated
under
the
constitution
provisions
as
well
as
the
federal
act.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
yes,
they
can
take
judicial
notice
of
the
statute
in
the
demanding
state.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
they
can
look
at
court
decisions
that
amount
to
the
general
law
of
the
state,
of
the
demanding
state.
that's
true.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
that
would
again
go
to--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
the
extent
to
which
they
can
look
at
those
is
very
limited
and
it
has
to
appear
on
the
face
of
the
documents
that
the
charges
as
set
forth
in
the
charging
documents
clearly
do
not
fit
within
the
law
if,
for
example,
if
another
state--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--well,
i
wouldn't
go
to
that
extent.
it
has
to
be
so
clear
that
there
is
no
interpretation
of
the
demanding
state's
law
by
the
asylum
state.
they
can't
go
that
far.
xxx.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
right.
if
it
reasonably
fits
within
the
law
of
the
demanding
state.
if
it's
clear
on
its
face
that
it
does.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no,
no.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no.
because
that
would--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--that
goes,
no,
that
goes
to
the
question
of
an
affirmative
defense
to
the
charge
that
can
be
raised
only
in
the
demanding
state.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no,
you
cannot
look
at
that
xxx.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
then
you're
presupposing
the
other
fact
and
that
is
the
fact
that
somehow
the
papers
show
that
it--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--no,
what
you
cannot
rely
upon
is
an
asylum
state
court
interpretation
of
the
demanding
state's
law.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
not
if
it's
the
demanding
state.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
exactly.
that's
what
i'm
trying
to
say.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
that's
my
premise
that
they
are
the
judge
of
what
the
law
says.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
if
their
statute
is
included
in
the
papers
let's
say,
which
often
is
the
case
and
clearly
the
allegation
simply
does
not
state
a
crime
under
the
law
of
that
demanding
state
then
there
might
be
an
argument
to
be
made
that
he's
not
substantively
charged.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
what
actually--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--no,
what
actually
happens--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--no.
no
it
isn't,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
what
actually
happens
in
those
situations
and
believe
me
they
do
not
come
up
in
the
extradition
context
because
of
the
communication
that
goes
on
between
the
asylum
state
authorities
and
the
demanding
state
authorities.
and,
if
there
would
appear
to
be
a
question
in
the
mind
of
the
executive
people
who
are
reviewing
the
documents,
then
the
matter
is
cleared
up
as
a
matter
of
demanding
state
law.
the
demanding
state
authorities
are
the
ones
who
are
to
determine--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--that's
right.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
right,
they
are
second
guessing
the
governor.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
there
wouldn't
be
any
inquiry
in
that
particular
situation
because
it
is
lawful
to
charge
simply
in
the
language
of
the
statute,
or
even
charges--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--yes,
you
do
and
that's
why
i
say
there
wouldn't
be
an
inquiry
xxx.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
again
i
think
goes
to
the
point
that
you
don't
presume
to
know.
that's
what
louisiana
authorities--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--to
decide.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
i'd
have
to
agree
with
that.
yes,
your
honor,
because
you
don't
know
how
far
to
go
in
the
extradition
context.
it's
supposed
to
be
a
summary
proceeding.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no
reasonable
possibility--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--i'm
not
familiar--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--with
that
particular
language
in
the
drew
case.
in
fact,
i
believe
in
the
drew
case
it
held
just
the
opposite.
there
appeared
to
be
a
very--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--well,
that's
true.
if
the
reasonable
possibility
standard
would
simply
mean
that
on
the
face
of
the
documents
it
appears
that
it's
possible
that
he
is
charged
with
a
crime.
if
you
can
determine
on
the
face
of
those
documents
that
there
is
no
such
possibility
then
that
particular
factor
of
those
four
in
michigan
v.
doran
is
missing.
and
therefore,
he
might
be
entitled
to
habeas
corpus
relief
in
that
particular
situation.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
whether
the
extradition
papers
are
facially
valid?
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
yes.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no,
because
then
the
invalidity
does
not
appear
on
its
face
to
anyone
reading
the
document.
this
particular
judge
happened
to
have
outside
knowledge
which
was
irrelevant
to
that
particular
inquiry
at
the
habeas
corpus
hearing
in
the
asylum
state.
and,--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--the
asylum
state
would
not
be
helpless,
your
honor,
but
the
court
in
habeas
corpus
hearing
would
not
have
the
authority
to
go
into
that
particular
question.
again,
that's
where
you
get
into
the
executive
branch.
this
is
an
executive
proceeding.
i
want
to
emphasize
that,
that
there
in
these
cases
there
commonly
is
communication
between
two
states.
if
something
looks
amiss
upon
the
executive
branch
examination
of
these
papers,
whether
it
be
fraud,
a
false
affidavit,
any
of
those
areas
that
you
had
been
discussing,
the
communication
takes
place.
the
governor,
in
fact,
the
governor
in
this
case
took
two
months
to
issue
his
governor's
warrant
of
rendition.
and
there
was
an
inquiry
made
into
some
of
these
factors
and
communication
was
made
with
the
state
of
louisiana.
and
that
is
the
source,
the
check
where
these
types
of
frauds
and
inconsistencies
ought
to
be
brought
up--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--well--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--i'm
aware--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--i'm
aware
of
the
case
of
branstead
which
is
before
this
court.
up
till
now
it
has
at
least
been
presumed
that
what
has
grown
to
be,
or
become
known
to
be
discretion
does
lie
with
the
governor.
but
even
if
the
governor
doesn't
have
discretion
to
deny
the
extradition,
this
communication
still
takes
place
and
on
many
occasions
the
governor
can
communicate
to
the
demanding
state's
governor
and
ask
that
he
withdraw
his
request
after
giving
him
all
these
facts.
and
that's
happened.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
"substantially
charged"
i
see--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--that's
in
the
uniform
act.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
no,
but
it's
been
used--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--no.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
it's
been
used
by
this
court
in
several
cases
and
i--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--i
believe
so.
i
believe
so,
your
honor.
the
uniform
act
does
use
it.
but
it
doesn't
change
the
constitutional
requirement
in
this
way.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
it
simply
means
that
the
substance
of
a
charge
must
appear
on
the
papers
and
i
think
what
that
means
is,
we
don't
go
into
possible
pleading
defects,
whether
it's
charged
every
element
of
the
offense
or
any
of
those
things.
if
the
substance
of
an
offense
appears
on
the
papers
then
that
satisfies
the
requirement.
that's
all
substantially
xxx.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
that's
correct.
that's
right.
just
the
substance.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
well,
they
don't
change
it,
they
communicate.
they
communicate--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--to
make
sure
that--
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
--it
does
happen,
yes.
free
communication
between
the
two
executives.
i
would
like
to
reserve
whatever
time
left
i
have,
your
honor,
for
rebuttal.
mr.
j.
robert
jibson
i'd
just
like
to
make
a
couple
of
points.
first
of
all,
we
do
deem
this
a
criminal
case.
it
is
a
criminal
case.
the
charges
are
still
pending
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
what
brought
this
into
the
criminal
justice
system
was
mr.
smolin's
exercise
of
self-help,
which
is
in
itself,
one
of
the
things
that
the
parental
kidnapping
prevention
act,
by
its
very
title
is
designed
to
prevent.
and,
i
don't
want
to
get
into
the,
to
make
this
a
custody
case
but
this
court
does
not
have
to
decide
the
question
of
who's
entitled
to
custody
here.
suffice
it
to
say
as
it
was
stated
earlier,
the
louisiana
prosecutor
does
dispute
this.
and,
i've
got
some
knowledge
about
him,
but
i'm
not
going
to
go
outside
the
record
either
to
tell
you
his
reasons
for
that.
but
the
point
is,
what's
being
attempted
here
is
simply
to
come
in
through
the
back
door
with
what
you
cannot
come
in
through
the
front
door
with
and
that
is
a
defense
to
this
charge
in
louisiana.
this
analogy
to
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
i
think,
is
inappropriate
because
that
by
definition
is
restricted
to
the
pleadings
and
here
they
had
to
go
outside
the
pleadings
which
in
this
case,
are
the
extradition
documents
to
bring
in
some
extraneous
evidence
to
show
a
defense.
and,
we're
not
to
inquire
into
the
prosecutor's
motives
in
the
state
of
louisiana.
communication
has
been
had
with
authorities
in
both
states.
they
are
anxious
to
go
forward
with
this
case
and
if,
in
fact,
there
is
an
air
tight
defense
for
mr.
smolin,
then
he
is
to
bring
that
in
the
state
of
louisiana
where
these
charges
are
pending.
thank
you
very
much.
