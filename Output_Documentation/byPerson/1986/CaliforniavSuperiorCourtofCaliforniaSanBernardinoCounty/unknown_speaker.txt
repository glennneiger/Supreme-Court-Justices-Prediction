unknown
speaker
mr.
jibson
are
you
reciting
facts?
now,
from
where
are
you
getting
those
facts?
unknown
speaker
the
record
of
the
habeas
corpus
xxx.
unknown
speaker
xxx
does
the
state
argue
at
all
that
the
habeas
proceeding
should
not
have
gone
forward
at
all?
unknown
speaker
so
that
there
maybe
some
inquiry
made
by
the
habeas
court
into
what?
unknown
speaker
where
do
these
limitations
come
from.
unknown
speaker
well
now,
in
order
in
what
sense?
whether--
unknown
speaker
--whether
they're
properly
charged?
unknown
speaker
but
the
habeas
judge
could
look
at
the
habeas
papers,
all
of
the
papers--
unknown
speaker
--i
mean,
the
extradition
papers
rather.
unknown
speaker
and
determine
whether
or
not
the,
what's
his
name,
was
properly
charged,
may
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
determine
whether
properly
charged?
unknown
speaker
and
how
far
does
that
inquiry
go?
unknown
speaker
uh-huh.
xxx
also
have
to
show
that
it
is
a
crime
in
that
state
too?
unknown
speaker
in
both
states.
unknown
speaker
i'm
curious
to
know
where
that
requirement
comes
from,
because
one
would
think
that
the
louisiana
authorities
would
be
the
best
judge
of
whether
the
person
is
charged
with
a
crime
under
louisiana
law.
why
should
a
california
superior
court
look
into
the
law
of
louisiana?
unknown
speaker
and
the
uniform
extradition
act
says
that
the
court
of
the
asylum
state
may
examine
into
that
question.
unknown
speaker
then
why
should
the
court
in
california
go
that
far?
why
should
it
examine
it
where
the
state's
a
claimant
of
louisiana
law?
i
thought
your
position
was
that
you
just
looked
at
the
face
of
the
papers
and
if
those
papers
purported
to
state
a
charge
under
louisiana
law
that
was
the
end
of
it.
you're
not
supposed
to
go
to
the
statute
books
and
look
about
anything.
unknown
speaker
california
courts
don't
know
louisiana
law.
unknown
speaker
isn't
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
jibson,
suppose
xxx.
i
take
it
that
means
also
looking
at
the
face
of
the
affidavit's,
does
it
not?
the
affidavits
that
accompany
the--
unknown
speaker
--and
on
the
face,
they
do
state
a
charge.
unknown
speaker
let's
assume.
but,
let's
suppose
the
judge
knows,
personally
knows
from
previous
experience
with
the
case,
as
i
gather
was
the
case
here,
that
those
affidavits
do
not
state
the
facts
as
he
recalls
them
personally.
unknown
speaker
he
can't
do
that?
unknown
speaker
including
notice,
judicial
notice
of
lawful
judgments
and
decrees
of
the
asylum
state,
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
concede
that
the
california
custody
decree
granted
lawful
custody
of
the
children
to
mr.
smolin.
unknown
speaker
--well,
if
so,
could
the
smolin's
be
guilty
of
a
crime
in
louisiana?
of
this
crime,
if
mr.
smolin
had
lawful
custody?
unknown
speaker
xxx
federal
law
though,
it
seems
crystal
clear
that
only
california
had
jurisdiction.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
federal
parental
kidnapping
act
would
not
appear
to
give
any
state
other
than
california,
jurisdiction
to
modify
the
decree--
unknown
speaker
--as
long
as
one
of
the
parents
remained
in
california,
as
mr.
smolin
did.
unknown
speaker
let
me
just,
maybe
you've
already
answered
this,
but
xxx,
the
chief
justice's
question,
and
what
is
the
source
of
the
law
that
says
they
have
no
power
to
go
beyond
this?
what
do
you
rely
on?
do
you
rely
on
the
uniform
extradition
act,
the
federal
statute
or
the
federal
constitution
xxx?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
you
mean
you're
just
relying
on
an
opinion
of
this
court?
unknown
speaker
which
was
based
on
what?
unknown
speaker
and
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
so,
you
don't
rely
on
the
uniform
act
for
this
purpose?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
your
position,
i
want
to
be,
maybe
this
is
repetitive
and
i
don't
mean
to
do
that
but,
can
the
court
in
the
habeas
corpus
proceeding
at
least
inquire
as
to
whether
there
is
a
statute
in
louisiana
as
alleged
in
the
charging
papers?
can
it
look
at
the
statute
books?
in
your
view?
unknown
speaker
what
if
there
is
a
court
decision
in
the
demanding
state
construing
the
statute,
can
they
look
at
that?
say
there's
a
court
decision
that
says
the
prosecutor
in
a
case
like
this
has
the
burden
of
proving
that
the
alleged
kidnapper,
when
he's
a
parent,
did
not
have
custody?
unknown
speaker
for
what
purpose?
i
don't
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you're
slipping
into
a
trial
of
the
merits
once
you
start
looking
at
court
decisions.
unknown
speaker
--so
the
asylum
state
conducts
sort
of
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings
kind
of
a
call,
is
that
xxx.
unknown
speaker
so
long
as
the
requesting
state's
law
is
clear,
the
asylum
state
can
use
it,
is
that
it?
unknown
speaker
all
you
need
is
a
clear
defense
to
the
charge
and
you
can't
be
extradited?
unknown
speaker
i
thought
that's
what
you
just
said.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
don't
understand
what
you're
saying
then.
unknown
speaker
affirmative
defenses
are
not
allowed,
even
if
they're
clear?
unknown
speaker
even
if
they're
in
the
statute?
supposing
the
statute
contains
a
proviso,
provided
that
it
shall
not
constitute
the
crime
of
kidnapping
if
the
alleged
kidnapper
happens
to
be
the
father
who
has
a
decree
awarding
him
custody
of
the
child?
and
it's
all
spelled
out
in
the
statute?
we
still
couldn't
look
at
that?
is
that
your
view,
because
it's
an
affirmative
defense?
unknown
speaker
even
though
it's
perfectly
clear
on
the
face
of
the
statute
that
the
man
can
not
be
convicted
of
a
crime?
unknown
speaker
i
say
we're
relying
on
louisiana
code
provision
xyz.
you
read
it
and
it
says
in
there
if
he's
the
custodial
parent
he
cannot
be
charged
with
this
crime.
that
it's
an
affirmative
defense
in
the
statutes
and
the
proviso.
you
say
you
can't
rely
on
that
as
i
understand
your
view.
unknown
speaker
no
matter
how
clear?
unknown
speaker
even
if
there's
a
cow
case
right
on
all
fours,
you
can't
rely
on
it?
well,
then
you're
saying
in
effect--
unknown
speaker
--you're
saying
in
effect
that
the
louisiana
authorities
are
the
judge
of
whether
he's
charged
under
louisiana
law.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
you're
not
really
saying
that.
you're
saying,
unless
it's
clear.
i
mean
that's
what
i'm
trying,
i
can
understand
that.
that
a
sensible
position,
leave--
--it's
clear.
why
not
just
stick
with
the
proposition
that
the
louisiana
authorities
are
the
judge
of
what
louisiana
law
says.
unknown
speaker
but--
unknown
speaker
--so
the
asylum
state
courts
can
second
guess
the
prosecutor
who
wrote
out
the
charge.
he
made
a
charge
under
a
certain
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
the,
so
you
can
review
his,
you
can
in
effect
grant
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
charge
a
crime.
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
it
sounds
like
it.
unknown
speaker
but
that's
the
governor's
inquiry.
we're
talking
about
a
habeas
corpus.
unknown
speaker
a
court
inquiry
after
the
kind
of
second
guessing
the
governor.
unknown
speaker
well,
supposing
that
there's
an,
i
don't
know
if
louisiana
has
information
or
indictments,
but
supposing
the
charge
simply
is
that
the
county
attorney
of
st.
tammany
county
charges
that
this
defendant
violated
section
11256
of
louisiana
code.
now
what
sort
of
an
inquiry
can
be
made
by
the
asylum
state?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
do
you
know
what's
lawful
in
louisiana?
you're
a
california
lawyer.
if
that
comes
from
louisiana,
don't
you
simply
presume
it's
lawful
to
charge
that
way
in
louisiana.
unknown
speaker
well
then
you
don't
look
at
anything
but
the
paper?
right.
unknown
speaker
i
wouldn't
be
too
sure.
louisiana's
civil
law
and
the
other
states
are
common
law.
so
how
do
you
know
what
happens
in
a
civil
law
state?
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
even
look.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
look.
you
wouldn't
even
if
there,
even
if
you
went
to
the
louisiana
statute
books
and
you
find
that
there
is
no
section
11256.
it
does
not
exist,
or
it's
been
repealed.
right?
you
would
not
look
at
that?
that's
none
of
your
business.
that's
for
the
executive.
right.
unknown
speaker
well,
despite
michigan
v.
doran,
counsel,
there
are
a
few
statements
in
earlier
opinions
of
this
court
that
indicate
that
if
it's
clear
there
is
no
reasonable
possibility
that
the
fugitive
is
guilty
that
the
asylum
state
court
can
refuse
extradition.
what
do
you
do
about
that
language
in
the
strauss
case
and
the
drew
case?
unknown
speaker
xxx
valid.
unknown
speaker
that
language?
unknown
speaker
well,
drew
said
that
extradition
is
proper,
given
the
reasonable
possibility
that
the
fugitive
may
have
committed
a
crime
under
the
other
state.
unknown
speaker
as
i
understand
your
position
now,
really
the
only
inquiry
that
can
be
made
in
the
asylum
state
in
this
proceeding,
is
whether
the
extradition
papers
are
facially
valid.
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
facially
valid,
and
you
can't
make
any
inquiry
beyond
that?
now
suppose
this
judge
as
i
understand
it
had
had
considerable
experience,
at
least
some,
with
this
very
case,
had
he
not,
previously?
unknown
speaker
the
habeas
judge
had?
and
suppose
he
looks
at
these
papers
and
on
their
face
they
all
look
very
proper,
but
he
knows
because
he
was
there
that
the
affidavit
is
misleading.
doesn't
really
tell
what
actually
occurred,
as
he
remembers
how
it
occurred.
would
that
be
sufficient
basis
for
him
to
say
that
to
that
extent
the
papers
are
facially
invalid?
unknown
speaker
and
i
suppose
it
appeared
that
indeed
the
extradition
request
itself
had
been
obtained
by
fraudulent
means?
the
asylum
state
still
was
helpless
to
refuse
to
send--
unknown
speaker
--well,
i
suppose
it's
possible
though
that
the
governor
has
no
discretion
either--
unknown
speaker
--to
refuse
extradition.
unknown
speaker
i
think
you're
making
an
assumption
that
may
not
be
valid.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jibson,
your
new
position,
or
your
position,
if
it
isn't
a
new
one,
that
you
just
look
within
the
four
corners
of
the
instrument,
how
do
you
square
that
with
the
language,
"substantially
charged"?
unknown
speaker
where
is
that
language
by
the
way?
that's
in
the
uniform
act,
right?
unknown
speaker
it's
not
in
the
federal
statute.
unknown
speaker
and
in
it's
not
in
the
constitution?
unknown
speaker
so,
who
made
it
up?
unknown
speaker
before
the
uniform
act
was
adopted?
unknown
speaker
i
understand.
well,
just
tell
me
what
it
means
then
if
it
doesn't
mean
that
you--
unknown
speaker
--or,
what
you
really
mean
is
the
substance
of
an
alleged
offense?
unknown
speaker
the
governor
sometimes
by
telegram,
sometimes
by
telephone,
but
many
times
completely
informally
changed
all
of
that?
unknown
speaker
they
communicate--
unknown
speaker
--and
said
this
point
here
doesn't
appear
to
be
correct
because
the
facts
are
thus
and
so.
and
the
governor
changes
it.
that
happens
every
day.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
jibson.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
riordan.
unknown
speaker
this
is
section
1738
of
what,
the
kidnapping
act?
unknown
speaker
i
don't
know,
i
mean,
maybe
that's
right,
but
really
what
we're
talking
about
here
is
whether
that
issue
going
to
be
fought
about
in
california
or
in
louisiana.
unknown
speaker
now
why
should
it
be
fought
about
in
california?
unknown
speaker
but,
if
you
put
it
the
other
way,
you
say
you
don't
get
to
that
until
you
decide
what
issues
you
can
raise
in
california.
unknown
speaker
that
language
isn't
in
the
act.
it
isn't
in
the
federal
act
and
it
isn't
in
the
constitution.
unknown
speaker
what
the
justification
for
it?
unknown
speaker
what's
the
justification
for
the
court
having
read--
unknown
speaker
--wait
till
i
finish
my
question.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
justification
for
the
court
having
read
the
extradition
clause
that
way
in
the
first
place?
unknown
speaker
but
how
does
the
superior
court
of
california,
i
mean
it
seems
that's
a
very
wasteful
proceeding
to
have
them
trying
to
find
about
louisiana
law.
unknown
speaker
is
lewis
a
case
from
this
court?
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
know
who
the
sole
legal
custodian
is
the
defendant
just
on
the
face
of
the
papers?
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
bring
in
this
decree.
unknown
speaker
you
have
to
bring,
and
that
would
ordinarily
not
be
a
demur.
you
would
demur
to
the
pleading
or
the
charge--
unknown
speaker
--you
don't
bring
in
evidence
aliunde.
unknown
speaker
so
then
the
superior
court
in
san
bernardino
county
has
to
not
only
know
the
louisiana
statute
law,
but
it
has
to
know
what
grounds
could
be
raised
in
a
demur
in
louisiana.
that's
how
you
go
about
making
this
decision?
unknown
speaker
the
common
law
of
what
state?
unknown
speaker
the
common
law
of
what
state?
unknown
speaker
and
then
you
can
bring
in
evidence
outside
the
pleadings
is
your
theory,
i
guess.
unknown
speaker
how
do
you
get
this
california
decree
in
there?
unknown
speaker
then
you
can
bring
in
some
evidence
outside
the
pleadings?
unknown
speaker
what
if
louisiana
law
provided
otherwise?
that
not
only
can
you
not
bring
in
any
evidence,
but
you
can't
bring
any
judicial
decrees
in.
it's
just
a
traditional,
very
narrow
demur.
unknown
speaker
would
that
bind
the
california
court
under
your
view?
unknown
speaker
well,
what's
the
source
of
federal
law?
unknown
speaker
so,
you
think
this
courts
decision,
roberts,
laid
down
a
whole
guideline
to
pleading,
you
know,
what
you
could
raise
in
this
thing
and
that
sort
of
thing?
unknown
speaker
well,
yeah,
the
only
case
we
would
be
narrowing
would
be
roberts,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but,
we
don't
overrule
state
supreme
court
decision.
we
may
disapprove.
unknown
speaker
well,
in
michigan
the
claim
was
the
michigan
court
said,
"substantially
charged"
means
that
we
look
at
the
facts
to
see
it
there
was
probable
cause.
and
we
said,
no
that
isn't
what
"substantially"
means
at
all.
unknown
speaker
xxx.
unknown
speaker
mr.
riordan,
are
you
sure
that
the
existence
of
a
custody
decree
is
a
matter
of
law?
let's
say
parentage,
is
parentage
a
matter
of
law,
whether
i
am
the
father
or
not?
unknown
speaker
but
let's
assume
a
particular
indictment
would
be
absolutely
invalid
if
i
was
the
father,
and
valid
if
i
wasn't.
would
my
parentage,
my
natural
parentage
would
obviously
be
a
question
of
fact
not
of
law,
right?
but,
what
if
i
had
adopted
the
child
and
there's
an
adoption
decree.
is
that
converted
from
a
question
of
fact
in
to
a
question
of
law?
it
would
take
notice
of
an
adoption
decree?
unknown
speaker
oh,
i
see.
unknown
speaker
i
see
why
you're
going--
unknown
speaker
--would
you
lose
if
there
was
any
other
judge
but
this
judge?
unknown
speaker
the
judge
that
had
personal
knowledge.
if
you
had
a
judge
that
didn't
have
personal
knowledge
would
you
lose?
unknown
speaker
would
you
get
the
judgment
on
the
pleadings
before
a
judge
that
didn't
know
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
would
he
find
the
facts?
unknown
speaker
the
facts.
unknown
speaker
i
have
trouble
with
happenstance,
frankly.
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
mr.
riordan,
can
you
give
us
any
guidance
on
how
clear
the
law
has
to
be?
i
mean,
we
went
around
and
around
on
that
with
mr.
jibson.
unknown
speaker
and
i
guess
we
eventually
ended
up,
it
doesn't
matter
how
clear
it
is.
now
you
say
that
we
do
take
law
into
account.
unknown
speaker
you
know,
you
can
have
some
very
refined
questions
of
law
that
go
to
whether
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleading
should
be
granted
or
not.
unknown
speaker
so,
the
test
is
not
simply
whether
it's
an
issue
of
law?
the
test
is
what?
unknown
speaker
mr.
riordan,
xxx
his
father.
unknown
speaker
that
assumes
that
the
sole
legal
custodian
is
his
father.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
who
decides
that?
unknown
speaker
who
is
entitled
to
decide
that?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
it
that
it
would
be
better,
i
wondered
who
was
entitled
to
decide
it
under
the
extradition
clause?
unknown
speaker
may
i
interrupt
you
just
one
minute?
i
tried
to
interrupt
you
before.
i'd
like
to
get
back
to
a
fairly
simple-minded
question.
is
it
your
position
that
if
one
in
california
is
found
to
be
the
custodian
of
a
particular
child,
that
he
then
may
by
self-help,
wherever
he
may
find
the
child,
whatever
the
child's
condition,
he
may
kidnap
the
child?
unknown
speaker
is
that
your
position?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
is
it
then?
unknown
speaker
well,
let's
focus
on
this
case.
unknown
speaker
yes,
here
you
have
a
california
decree
that
we
assume
is
valid
and
instead
of
having
it
enforced
by
the
customary
means
of
enforcing
judicial
decrees
the
father
who
won
in
california
decides
he's
going
to
enforce
it
himself.
so,
he
goes
to
louisiana
and
he
picks
the
child
up
at
a
bus
stop.
unknown
speaker
suppose
the
child
had
been
home
in
bed,
or
in
the
back
yard?
so
you
don't
get
into
a
fourth
amendment
situation--
unknown
speaker
--perhaps.
or
suppose
a
child
had
been
in
a
hospital?
suppose
the
child
had
been
in
new
york?
unknown
speaker
he
could
go
anywhere
he
wants
and
enforce
the
california
judgment
himself.
unknown
speaker
he
committed
a
law
into
louisiana.
unknown
speaker
he
committed
a
violation
under
louisiana
law.
unknown
speaker
he
may
lawfully
do
it.
unknown
speaker
well,
the
lawyer
for
california
here
today
conceded
when
i
asked
him
that
question,
that
it
does
not
violate
louisiana
law
if
mr.
smolin
had
lawful
custody
for
him
to
take
him.
that
was
the
first
concession
he
made.
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
today.
unknown
speaker
mr.
riordan,
let
me
ask,
if
you
are
a
law
enforcement
official
who
gets
somebody
from
another
state,
you
initiate
the
process
of
extradition,
on
an
indictment
that
is
so
patently
invalid
that
it
would
be
subject
to
a
demur
as
you
put
it,
would
you
be
liable
for
any
civil
damages
for
false
arrest
or
imprisonment,
or
something
don't
you
think?
don't
you
think
it's
pretty
risky
business?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
understand.
well,
i'm
trying
to
think--
unknown
speaker
--a
good
faith
defense.
unknown
speaker
is
the
fact
that
this
particular
judge
was
personally
familiar
with
this
case,
is
that
fact
at
all
relevant
to
our
decision
of
the
case.
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
judicial
notice
of
what?
unknown
speaker
and
these
were
files,
were
they,
of
the
superior
court?
unknown
speaker
well,
hadn't
the
custody
decree
been
appealed?
and
hadn't
the
former
spouse
of
mr.
smolin
appeared
and
litigated
it
in
california?
unknown
speaker
but,
mr.
riordan,
why
if
it's
so
clear
is
louisiana
insisting
on
this?
it's
just
a
little
hard
to
understand,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
all
right
then
don't.
[laughter]
is
it
your
position
that
we
are
bound
to
take
the
louisiana
judgment
and
give
it
full
faith
and
credit
and
everything.
i
mean
the
california
one.
unknown
speaker
but
ignore
the
louisiana
one.
both
from
state
courts.
unknown
speaker
what's
this
man--
unknown
speaker
--xxx
excuse
me,
was
it
texas?
well,
why
is
texas?
what's
wrong
with
texas?
unknown
speaker
right.
unknown
speaker
the
district
attorney
who
acted
in
this
case
in
louisiana
thought
that
the
california
decree
had
been
obtained
by
misrepresentation
and
fraud.
unknown
speaker
that's
what
the
record
shows,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
he
thought,
that
maybe
totally
false
but--
unknown
speaker
--mr.
riordan,
did
your
client
take
the,
did
he
make
an
appearance
in
the
texas
court?
unknown
speaker
he
didn't
object
to
it
in
any
way?
he
couldn't
have
objected
officially
if
he
didn't
make
an
appearance,
could
he?
unknown
speaker
well,
why
didn't
the
texas
court
find
him?
unknown
speaker
what
has
happened
so
far
as
custody
was
concerned
following
the
texas
judgment?
unknown
speaker
extradition
didn't
shift
it,
the
kidnapping
did.
unknown
speaker
you
wouldn't
of
had
the
extradition.
unknown
speaker
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
riordan,
you
say
that.
does
your
opponent
agree
to
that?
unknown
speaker
well,
if
the
children,
if
the
case
had
gone
back
to
louisiana
right
away,
it
probably
would
have
been
dismissed
long
ago,
as
you
say.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say
it's
so
clear
that
nobody
could
possibly
dispute
it.
unknown
speaker
thank
you,
mr.
riordan.
unknown
speaker
mr.
jibson,
you
have
three
minutes
remaining.
