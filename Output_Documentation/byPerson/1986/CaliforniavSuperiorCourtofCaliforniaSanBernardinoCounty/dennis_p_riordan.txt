mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'd
like
to
begin
by
trying
to
clarify
what's
been
at
issue
in
this
case.
i
think
it's
gotten
a
little
muddled
because
mr.
jibson
came
here
today
looking
to
hit
a
single
and
he's
been
invited
to
hit
a
home
run.
and
i
think
his
position
in
response
to
that
has
changed.
before
we
got
here
the
following
things
were
clear.
one
the
california
decree
giving
richard
smolin
sole
custody
of
his
child
in
1981
was
valid
in
'81,
it's
valid
in
'84.
the
issue
has
been
completely
litigated
by
both
parties
in
california,
that's
a
matter
of
state
law.
he
was
the
legal
custodian
of
his
children
in
1984.
what
was
clear
before
we
came
here
today
was
that
under
federal
law,
that
decree
has
to
be
respected
in
louisiana.
it
was
clear,
one,
because
that
federal
law
holding
by
the
california
supreme
court
was
never
challenged
by
california
before
this
court,
which
it
could
have
been.
it's
also
clear
because
the
plain
language
of
28
u.s.c.
1738(a)
makes
it
absolutely
apparent
that
louisiana
will
and
must
respect
the
1981
california
decree.
furthermore,
if
you
look
at
the
case
law
in
louisiana
interpreting
1738(a),
and
i
can
cite
the
court
to
two
cases,
it's
absolutely
plain
that
they
will
hold
that
california
was
the
only
state
that
could
modify
the
decree,
that
the
'81
decree
was
valid.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no,
it's
the
federal
parental
kidnapping
prevention
act
of
1980
xx.
it's
a
full
faith
and
credit
act
which
is
found
in
28
u.s.c.,
which
was
passed
by
congress
to
make
sure
that
there
could
only
be
one
valid
custody
decree
at
any
time.
and
under
the
terms
of
that
act,
the
only
valid
custody
decree
in
1984,
when
richard
smolin
picked
up
his
children,
was
the
california
decree.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
precisely.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
the
reason
is
we
go
to
the
last
issue,
which
is,
if
he
was
the
sole
legal
custodian
can
he
have
committed
kidnapping
in
louisiana?
and
here's
what--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--right.
and
here's
where
we
get
to
the
single
rather
than
the
home
run.
the
single
is
relying
on
a
hundred
years
of
precedent.
mr.
jibson
says,
it
is
true
that
for
a
hundred
years
you've
gotten
a
common
law
demur
in
the
asylum
state.
that's
what
it
comes
down
to.
as
justice
scalia
said,
you
get
a
motion
for
judgment
on
the
pleadings.
that's
existed
since
this
court's
decision
in
roberts
v.
reilly
in
1885.
it's
existed
because
of
the
use
of
the
word,
"substantially"
in
roberts
and
in
the
act.
substantially
has
never
been
viewed
as
surplusage
if
the
act
said
you
determined
whether
there
is
a
charge
in
louisiana
and
there
always
is
in
an
extradition
case.
there's
always
a
charge
that's
been
lodged.
you
determine
if
there's
a
charge
and
that's
the
end
of
it.
"substantially"
has
always
been
interpreted
to
mean
it's
got
to
be
a
substantial
charge.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
but
it
is
in
100
years
of
precedent.
it
is
in
this
court's
decision
in
roberts
v.
reilly.
it
is
in
the
uniform
extradition
act.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
hum?
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
the--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
apologize.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i
think
the
justification
is
that
recognized
by
the
concurrence
in
michigan
v.
doran.
extradition
is
worse
than
an
ordinary
criminal
charge
because
you
have
to
be
processed
in
one
state.
you
have
to
be
forcibly
transported
to
another.
the
justification
is,
it's
not
unfair
to
a
demanding
state
to
file
an
indictment
that
passes
muster
under
their
own
law
as
a
question
of
law.
and
for
a
hundred
years
it's
worked
well
to
say,
you
get
a
demur.
that's
all
you
get.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
i
think
if
you
look
at
varona,
if
you
look
at
lewis,
which
is
cited
in
our
brief
in
new
york
case,
they
say,
hey,
we
are
not
going
to
descend
into
the
intricacies
of
louisiana
law
or
alabama
law
in
lewis.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no,
lewis
is,
almost
all
of
these
cases
with
the
exception
of
roberts
and
michigan
v.
doran
are,
these
come
up
in
state
courts
in
extradition
proceedings
and
they
are
legion.
you
make
this
demur
and
the
courts
have
said,
wait.
if
it
depends
on
an
interpretation
of
louisiana
law,
go
to
louisiana.
we're
not
the
experts
in
louisiana
law.
if
it's
a
facial,
if
the
judicial
gloss
on
the
statute
is
clear,
or
the
statute
is
clear
by
its
terms
then
you
do
have
a
right
to
a
demur
here.
and
no
one
can
suggest
under
the
louisiana
statute,
the
sole
legal
custodian
of
his
children
can
be
guilty
of
kidnapping.
louisiana--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--you
know
that--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--hum?
yes.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
that
brings
us,
let's
look
at
that,
as
an
example
let's
look
at
louisiana.
let's
pose
the
question
this
way.
if
you
were
to
demur
to
this
charge
in
louisiana
could
you
judicially
notice
the
california
decree
on
a
demur?
the
answer
is,
yes.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no,
no.
i
use
that
merely
as
analogy.
what
i'm
saying
is
that
you've
traditionally
gotten
a
common
law
demur
in
the
asylum
state.
now
the--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--hum?
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i
use
that
as
a
term
of
art.
what,
for
100
years,
what
you
have
gotten
in
every
state
of
the
union,
if
someone
seeks
extradition,
you've
been
allowed
to
say,
that
doesn't
make
it
on
the
pleadings.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
what
i
am
suggesting
is
the,
i
should
qualify
that.
it
depends
what
you're
talking
about.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
of
questions
of
law.
matters
of
law.
in
louisiana
as
an
example,
and
i
use
this
as
an
example.
if
richard
smolin
went
into
louisiana
under
section
532
of
louisiana
code
of
criminal
procedure,
he
gets
a
demur.
a
modern
equivalent
of
it.
a
motion
to
dismiss
for
failure
to
state
a
charge.
louisiana
would
say
and
does,
don't
bring
in
any
evidence
here.
don't
bring
in
evidence
of
justification
or
so
forth
and
so
on.
but
if
you
want
to
use
judicial
notice
to
bring
before
us
a
matter
of
law,
i.e.
a
california
decree,
you're
free
to
do
that.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
i
use--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--no,
i
use
louisiana
as
an
example,
because
it
isn't
a
question
of
louisiana
criminal
procedure,
it's
a
question
of
what
you've
been
allowed
under
federal
law
in
the
asylum
state.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
this
court's
decision
in
roberts
v.
reilly.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
we
cite
probably
a
dozen
cases
in
our
brief.
we
could
cite
100
that
say
for
the
last
100
years
the
fourth
exception
in
michigan
v.
doran,
was
listed
second.
that
is
you
check
to
see
whether
there
is
the
existence
of
a
charge,
has
been
interpreted
to
mean
you
check
to
see
whether
there's
a
substantial
charge?
that
is,
a
charge
that
would
withstand
a
demur?
now,
this
court
could
choose,
of
course,
to
reverse
100
years
of
precedent.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
no.
you'd
be
over-ruling
the
decisions
of
the
supreme
courts
of
probably--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
stand
clarified,
corrected.
yes,
what
you
would
be
doing
is
saying
that
the
word
"substantial"
in
roberts
and
the
word
"substantial"
in
the
uniform
extradition
act
has
always
been
interpreted
to
mean
that
you
get
a
demur.
but
we're
now
holding
that
all
it
means
is
that
you
get
to
check
and
see
whether
there's
been
an
indictment
filed.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
but
this
court
never
dealt
with--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--this
court
in
michigan
never
dealt
with
the
exception
that
we're
talking
about
here.
michigan
didn't
involve
fugitivity
and
it
didn't
involve
the
right
to
a
demur.
this
court
referred
to
the
fact
that,
the
interesting
thing
about
michigan
v.
doran
is
it
didn't
use
the
word
"substantial".
and
since
then
there
are
been,
an
argument
has
been
made
that
by
pulling
out
the
word
"substantial",
this
court
overruled
the
right
to
the
equivalent
of
a
common
law
demur
in
asylum
state.
if
it
did
that
would
be
a
very
strange
case
to
do
it
in
because
it
didn't
involve
the
scope
of
this.
and
i
use
demur
again
as
a
term
of
art,
this
judgment
on
the
pleading.
but
if
you
look
at
roberts,
if
you
look
at
all
of
the
state
cases
since
then
you
get
a
challenge
to
the
legal
sufficiency
of
the
charge
even
though
it's
in
the
asylum
state.
and
the
reasoning
has
been--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
it
is
if
two
parties
have
come
together,
litigated
an
issue
to
the
highest
court
in
the
state
and
settled
it
in
an
opinion
of
which
a
court
can
take
judicial
notice.
there's
no
more
argument.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
if,
as
in
this
case,
it's
res
judicata,
it's
been
fully
litigated
and
the
only
court
that
can
litigate
the
issue--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--and
is
no
longer
subject
to
challenge.
no
one
can
challenge
the
validity
of
richard's
'81
decree.
it's
happened.
it's
a
matter
of
california
law--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--initially
and
it's
been
fully
litigated.
and
all
california
did
in
doing
that
was
look
at
law.
it
didn't
look
at
fact.
now,
i
will
be
the
first
to
concede
that
if
this
court
decides
to
overrule
100
years
of
tradition
and
say
you
don't
get
a
common
law
demur,
you
don't
get
the
equivalent
of
a
motion
on
the
pleadings,
we
lose.
let
me
make
that
concession.
if
we
are
not
allowed
to
challenge
in
the
way
you
have
been
for
100
years,
the
louisiana
charge
in
the
sense
of
getting
a
demur
or
judgment
on
the
pleadings,
we
lose.
because
there
is
a
charge
in
louisiana.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
but
the--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--no,
we
would
win.
if
we
get
a
judgment
on
the
pleadings
conversely,
we
win.
and
we
win
before
any
judge--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--yes.
yes,
because--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--he
did
know
the
facts,
but
he
didn't
say
i
know
the
facts.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
we
would
still
win
because
the
judge
who
didn't
know
the
facts
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
california
decrees
which
were
final
and
binding.
so
the
happenstance
existed
that
this
judge
knew
the
facts
of
the
case.
but,--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--that
this
particular
judge--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--let
me
make
one
thing
clear,
your
honor.
this
was
not
the
judge
who
issued
the
child
custody
decree.
this
was
not
the
judge
who
originally
gave
custody
to
richard.
there
is
no
question
that
there
was
an
collusion
here
between
a
judge
originally
giving
custody
and
then
dealing
with
a
habeas
corpus
matter.
he
was
familiar
with
the
family
law
matter
because
he
was
the
judge
that
later
heard
the
challenge
to
the
'81
decree.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
the--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
agree,
and
i
think
if
you
look
at
a
decision
like
lewis,
where
it
was
a
new
york
court
act
and
they
said,
caution
is
called
for
in
this
situation.
we
are
not
he
authorities
on
louisiana,
in
that
case,
alabama
law.
you've
got
to
make
out
a
very
clear
case.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no.
the
courts
have
demanded
that
the
resolution
of
the
issue
of
foreign
law
be
crystal
clear.
in
this
case,
there
might
have
been
quibbling
about
the
validity
of
the
'81
california
decree.
that's
been
settled
in
a
california
court.
we
could
have
an
interesting
discussion.
perhaps
someone
once
has
a
complex
question
about
pkpa,
but
that's
a
federal
law
question
on
which
this
court,
and
louisiana
can
give
this
court
no
guidance
at
all.
this
is
the
court
that
eventually
decides
exactly
what
pkpa
means.
but
in
terms
of
the
louisiana
law
question
here,
if
anyone,
i
will
also
concede
we
should
lose
the
case
if
anyone
can
come
up
with
an
interpretation
of
the
louisiana
statute
under
which
the
sole
legal
custodian
of
his
children
could
commit
kidnapping.
it
would
be
like
saying
that
charles
lindburgh
had
he
gotten
the
kid
back
from
bruno
hauptman
could
have
been
prosecuted
under
this
statute.
it's
just
not
possible.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
hum?
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no,
i
don't
want
to
assume
that.
i'm
willing
to
demonstrate
it
as
a
proposition
xxx
the
law.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
hum?
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
we
can't
make
an
argument
that
louisiana
is
better
able
to
decide,
in
fact,
california--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--our
interpretation
of
the
extradition
clause
is
that
if
it's
simply
a
matter
of
applying
federal
law
then
california
as
the
asylum
state
is
entitled
to
apply
it.
and
i
would
suggest,
let
me
point
out
one
thing.
once
this
case
gets
to
louisiana,
federal
law--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--if--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--no.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
a
state
could
pass
a
statute
that
says
it
you
are
the
sole
legal
custodian
and
your
child
has
been
taken
by
an
interloper
or
by
a
parent
who
has
no
legal
right,
they
could
say
we'll
pass
a
statute
that
requires
you,
that
makes
it
a
civil
violation
or
criminal
violation
to
get
the
children
yourself.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
louisiana--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--uh-huh.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
uh-huh.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
uh-huh.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no.
he
might
commit
burglary
if
he
did
that.
he
might--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--no,
he
didn't,
whatever--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--no,
no.
my
position
is
just
this.
that
can
be
very
unwise
to
do
that.
it
could
even
be
illegal
to
do
it.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
he
can
lawfully
do
it
without
violating
louisiana
kidnapping
statute.
because
the
louisiana
kidnapping
statute
says
that
a
legal
custodian
can't
commit
kidnapping.
they
could
say
he
committed
trespass.
let's
say
he
took
a
buzz
saw
and
sawed
his
ex-wife's
car
in
half.
he
might
have
committed
four
felonies
by
doing
that,
but
he
won't
have
committed
kidnapping
which
is
the
only
charge--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--there
simply--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
don't
think
there's
any
question
about
that
and
i
would
just
refer
you
to
one
thing
as
well
which
is
a
case
called
snyder
v.
snyder,
474
south
2nd,
1374,
it's
a
court
of
appeals
decision
of
louisiana
in
1985.
it
involved
a
situation
where
a
father
in
utah
got
a
valid
modification
decree,
came
in
and
took
the
children
forcibly
from
the
mother.
the
louisiana
court
in
a
civil
action
said,
one,
the
utah
decree
was
valid
under
pkpa
and
we
have
to
follow
pkpa.
two,
there's
not
a
hint
in
that
opinion
that
there
was
anything
therefore
illegal
under
louisiana
law
by
him
taking
the
children
once
he
had
the
valid
decree.
i
will
be
the
first
to
say
that
if
louisiana
wanted
to
make
sure
that
you
go
into
court
to
execute
on
these,
it
could
pass
a
statute.
perhaps
it
would
make
it
a
misdemeanor
to
take
children
even
if
you
are
the
legal
custodian,
but
it's
clear
that
under
it's
kidnapping
statute
you
can't
violate
the
kidnapping
statute
if
you're
the
sole
legal
custodian,
which
mr.
smolin
is.
and
that
is
a
question
of
federal
law
that
is
better
resolved
in
california
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
once
this
case
goes
to
louisiana,
louisiana
is
barred
from
pkpa
by
1738(a),
from
questioning
the
california
decree
at
all.
if
there
had
been
any
defect
in
the
california
decree,
and
there
wasn't,
the
only
place
that
it
could
have
been
raised
collaterally
was
in
california.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i've
got
enough
trouble
with
the
questions
that
you've
thrown
at
me
about
that.
[laughter]
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i
think
it's
clear
that
any
such
officer
under
the
decisions
of
this
court
would
have
a
good
faith
defense
that
would
render
him
immune
from
any
liability.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that.
it's
in
part,
a
question
of
federal
law.
certainly
under
federal
law
i
think
there
would
be
immunity
from
any
claim
of
violation
of
a
person's
right
if
he
acted
on
a
decree
in
that
context.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
because
he
did
not
say,
i'm
familiar
with
the
facts
and
i'm
going
to
rely
on
my
personal
knowledge.
he
said
i'm
going
to
rely
on
the
device
of
judicial
notice,
which
is
the
device
that
would
have
been
available
to
any
judge.
and
he
did
not
do
other
than
take
judicial
notice--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--of
the
decrees
in
the
civil
case
which
established
that
richard
smolin
was
the
sole
legal--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--they
were
files
of
the
san
bernardino
superior
court.
might
i
point
out
this?
what
is
now
before
you
is
the
judgment
of
the
california
supreme
court.
prior
to
that
decision,
the
entire
matter
had
been
fully
litigated
up
to
a
published,
an
unpublished,
but
a
written
opinion
of
the
court
of
appeal
which
had
become
final
which
before
you
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
she
had,
i
mean,
one
of
the
things
that
really
put
a
judge
on
a
tough
spot
if
we
were
to
adopt
the
rule
that
there
couldn't
be
judicial
notice.
she
had
appeared
before
him
and
said,
i
want
to
contest
his
'81
decree.
let's
have
a
hearing
on
it.
she
had
a
hearing.
she
got
a
ruling.
she
appealed
that
ruling
and
eventually
got
partial
relief
on
appeal.
the
court
said
the
'81
decree
was
valid,
but
you're
now
free
to
obtain
joint
custody
today.
yet
then,
that
same
judge
looks
at
an
affidavit
that's
sworn
out
after
all
of
that
occurs
that
says
he
had
no
decree.
he
had
no,
i
should
correct
that.
he
had
no
legal
authority
at
the
time
he
took
the
children.
that's
pretty
tough
stuff
for
a
judge
to
say,
i've
litigated
this
matter--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--well,
your
honor,
i
was
here
on
monday
and
i
saw
in
attorney
get
in
trouble
by
making
assertions
outside
the
record.
i
think
i
can
answer
that
question,
but
i
can't
do
it
by
staying
within
the
four
corners
of
this
particular--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no,
there
is
no
louisiana
judgment.
the
two
judgments
were--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--texas.
let
me
clarify
this.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
there's
nothing
wrong
with
it
at
all.
you
could
get
a
complicated
conflicting
decree
case
but
this
isn't
it.
what
happened
is
that
the
original
decree
went
to
the
wife.
she
got
sole
custody.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
fine.
it
was
valid
when
it
was
issued.
she
went
to
get
texas
and
got
that
recognized,
full
faith
and
credit.
the
texas
judgment
merely
recognized
the
rights
in
texas
that
she
had
in
california.
there
is
no
conflict.
it
was
consonant
with
the
california
decree
and
recognized
only
such
rights
as
existed
in
california.
and
under
pkpa
that's
all
it
could
do.
so,
therefore,
when
the
california
decree
comes
down
and
give
him
sole
custody,
modifying
the
original
decree,
it
modified
the
rights
that
he
had,
she
had
in
california
and
the
rights
that
she
had
in
texas,
cause
it
simply
modified
xxx.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
think
its--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--there's
a
statement
somewhere
to
that
effect,
but
i
think
it's
not
fair
of
us
to
demand
of
our
district
attorney's
that
they
understand
anything
about
child
custody
law.
and
frequently,
they
don't.
i
mean,
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
that
the
california
decree,
it's
been
litigated
fully
on,
if
there
were
any
fraud,
any
misrepresentation,
any
unconstitutionality
in
it,
it
could
have
been
taken
to
this
court
itself.
it's
full
and
final.
it's
over.
that's
settled.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
no.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
well,
the
texas
judgment
is
a
full,
we
don't,
the
texas
judgment
is
fine.
it
gives
full
faith
and
credit--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--the
texas
judgment
gave
full
faith
and
credit
to
the
original
judgment.
and
all
we
are
saying
about
that
is,
you
can
accept
it
as
valid
at
the
time
it's
issued.
it
can,
it
did
purport
to
give
no
rights
other
than
those
in
california.
and
therefore,
when
the
rights
in
california
were
modified,
that's
the
whole
point
of
pkpa.
another
state
can
recognize
your
rights
anywhere
else.
but,
it
can't
give
you
new
rights.
it
can't
give
you
independent
rights.
the
only
state
that
can
modify
the
original
rights
is
the
state
of
the
original
decree.
so,
when
california
modified
to
give
him
custody,
it
modified
the
original
california
decree
and
the
original
texas
decree.
the
texas
decree
has
no
independent
existence.
and
this,
it
may
take
a
little,
have
taken
me
a
somewhat
secuitcus
route
to
explain
it,
but
it's
not
a
complicated
question
and
it's
a
federal
law
question
that
is
better
litigated
in
california
than
it
is
in
louisiana.
i
would
suggest
this
to
you,
that
the
whole
point
of
pkpa
was
to
make
sure
that
adjudication
stay
in
the
original
state.
here
we
have
a
situation
where
extradition
is
really
being
used
to
shift
the
focus
away
from
a
state
that
under
federal
law
should
be
the
locus
of
this
litigation,
and
that
is
california.
let
me,
perhaps
there
by--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--no,
no.
the
kidnapping
in--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--the
kidnapping--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--the
kidnapping
though,
your
honor,
justice
marshall,
brought
this
case
back
to
the
locus
where
it
always
supposed
to
be.
the
original
decree
state.
let
me
just
add
this.
and
these
are
sort
of
mundane
considerations
for
this
elevated
atmosphere.
one
thing
we
know
is
that
this
is
not
a
kidnapping
case.
richard
smolin
in
can
never
be
committed
of
kidnapping.
that
may
be
resolved
in
louisiana
rather
than
california,
depending
on
this
court's
judgment.
but
it's
just
the
case.
i
mean,
it's
not
a
criminal
case.
it
never
should
have
been
a
criminal
case.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
my
opponent
is
not
going
to
dispute
it.
he's
not
going
to
dispute
that
this
is
a
valid
california
decree
and
he's
not
going
to
dispute,
in
their
brief
they
say,
and
they
have
to,
that
the
california
decree
here
is
not
one
they
want
to
take
issue
with.
but
it's
going
to
be
a
civil
case.
it's
going
to
be
a
civil
case.
it
should
be
a
civil
case.
and
these
two
individuals
for
whom
a
lot
of
blame
can
be
attributed
to
both
of
them,
this
mother
and
father,
are
going
to
have
to
work
out
an
arrangement
so
they
both
can
have
their
children
again.
they're
going
to
have
to
finally
act
sensibly
and
settle
this.
and
it
will
be
settled,
and
it
can
be
settled
as
a
civil
case.
and
the
sooner
that
it
stops
being
a
criminal
case,
an
auspicious
criminal
case,
the
sooner
i
think
these
children
are
going
to
for
the
first
time
in
ten
years,
enjoy
the
love
that
they
should
have
from
both
of
their
parents.
and
i'd
ask
this
court
to
put
an
end
to
it.
to
declare
that
the
case,
the
extradition
is
improper
because
the
charge
is--
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
--i
would
like
to
believe
that.
i
would
like
to
believe
that.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
right.
but
the
human
cost
for
richard
smolin
of
going
to
louisiana
in
1984,
after
he
had
his
children
for
the
first
time
in
six
years,
would
have
been
very
substantial.
and
i
submit
he
did
nothing
wrong
by
challenging
the
action
in
the
courts
of
louisiana.
mr.
dennis
p.
riordan
thank
you.
