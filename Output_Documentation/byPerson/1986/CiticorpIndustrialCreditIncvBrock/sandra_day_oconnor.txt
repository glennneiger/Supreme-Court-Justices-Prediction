justice
o'connor
mr.
lee,
has
this
question
just
never
come
up
before
in
the
context
of
a
secured
creditor?
justice
o'connor
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
does
support
the
respondent's
view,
and
congress
twice,
i
guess,
has
amended
the
statute
to
take
care
of
situations
that
apparently
it
hadn't
thought
about
before.
but
it
does
not
appear
to
have
taken
care
of
this
situation.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
lee,
let
me
ask
you
one
other
question.
under
section
215
to
remove
the
taint,
if
the
sixth
circuit
view
is
correct,
would
the
secured
creditor
have
to
pay
just
the
minimum
wage
or
the
full
agreed
wage,
do
you
suppose?
justice
o'connor
well,
if
it
were
only
the
minimum
wage
to
remove
the
taint,
certainly
you
could
say
that
the
statute...
that
your
view
continued
to
operate
as
to
the
difference
between
the
minimum
wage
and
the
agreed
wage.
would
that
not
be
important--
justice
o'connor
--if
that
were
true,
then
certainly
the
statute
wouldn't
completely
have
altered
the
priority
of
claims.
there
would
still
be
something
left
to
which
traditional
bankruptcy
and
priority
would
apply.
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
rothfeld,
there
really
is
no
concrete
evidence
in
the
legislative
history,
is
there,
to
tell
us
that
congress
was
thinking
about
this
problem
of
the
bankrupt
employer?
justice
o'connor
you
have
to
fall
back
on
plain
language.
you
certainly
can't
find
it
in
the
legislative
history.
justice
o'connor
mr.
rothfeld,
what
about
the
point
mr.
lee
makes,
that
the
secretary
has
taken
a
contrary
position
in
the
past?
