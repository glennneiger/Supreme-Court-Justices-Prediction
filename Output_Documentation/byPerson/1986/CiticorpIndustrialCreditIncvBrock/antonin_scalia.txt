justice
scalia
is
that
a
general
rule
or
do
we
know
when
we
ignore
the
language
and
consult
the
spirit?
do
we
intuit
that
or
what?
justice
scalia
mr.
lee,
is
it
common
ground
that,
if
the
employer
had
not
gone
into
insolvency
and
had
simply
failed
to
pay
a
certain
amount
of
wages,
he
still
has
plenty
of
money
and
he's
still
in
business,
would
it
have
been
a
violation
of
the
labor
standards
act
to
ship
the
goods
that
was
made
by
the
labor
for
which
he
has
not
yet
paid
the
wages?
justice
scalia
it
would?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
it's
clear
that
it's
not
just
a
violation
of
you
contract
for
a
lower
wage,
it's
also
a
violation
if
you
contract
for
a
proper
wage,
but
fail
to
pay
it?
justice
scalia
are
there
any
cases?
justice
scalia
if
that
weren't
a
violation,
then
this
whole
problem--
justice
scalia
mr.
lee,
you
said
earlier
that
the
secretary
has
taken
his
current
position
only
since
the
sixties;
and
for
the
first
25
years
what
was
the
situation?
he
had
taken
the
opposite
position
or
had
taken
no
position?
justice
scalia
well,
but
that
doesn't
answer
my
question.
it
may
be
the
first
time
he
had
taken
that
position,
but
had
he
previously
taken
the
opposite
position
or
had
he
previously
taken
none?
justice
scalia
you
say
it
need
not
be,
but
all
you
appeal
to
is
this
holy
trinity,
which
says
it's
a
familiar
principle,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
although
it's
apparently
not
a
sufficiently
familiar
principle
that
counsel
can
ever
find
any
case
other
than
holy
trinity
to
cite
for
it,
because
it's
an
old
chestnut
that
comes
up
constantly
when
that
principle
is
appealed
to.
is
there
any
language,
interpretation
of
the
language,
that
you
can
give
us
that
would
lead
to
the
conclusion
that
you
want?
or
is
it
just
you're
inviting
us
to
throw
up
our
hands
and
say,
well,
it
doesn't
say
that,
but
we
appeal
to
the
spirit
of
the
laws?
justice
scalia
they
made
an
exception
for
ministers,
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
you
don't
think
they
might
have
had
some
first
amendment
concerns?
justice
scalia
did
they
say
what
besides
ministers
were
covered
by
the
spirit
of
the
law?
justice
scalia
just
ministers?
justice
scalia
well,
but
of
course.
i
mean,
secured
creditor
were
still
intended
to
have
that
preference.
but
you
know,
we're
not
talking
about
all
secured
creditors
here
at
all,
and
we're
not
talking
about
their
preferential
position.
justice
scalia
your
clients
can
sell
the
stuff
in
intrastate
commerce,
i
presume.
justice
scalia
was
that
the
interpretation
current
at
the
time
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
scalia
they
didn't
intend
to.
is
it
part
of
your
theory
that
congress
can't
make
a
mistake,
that
there
is
no
such
thing
as
a
statute
that
has
an
unanticipated
consequence,
because
whenever
that
happens
we
invoke
the
spirit
of
the
law
and
correct
it?
is
that
the
way
the
system
works?
justice
scalia
well
then,
maybe
this
was
a
mistake.
justice
scalia
is
he
interpreting
the
statute
necessarily,
or
maybe
exercising
his
own
prosecutorial
discretion?
justice
scalia
just
as
a
prosecutor
may
say,
i'm
not
going
to
prosecute
for
a
small
amount
of
marijuana,
maybe
the
secretary
thinks
that
his
prosecutorial
discretion
is
better
used
on
other
things
than
seeking
a
remedy
for
wages
that
have
been
paid
up.
justice
scalia
well,
then
maybe
goods,
you
know,
manufactured
in
violation
of
the
act
doesn't
mean
that
payment
has
to
be
made
before
they
are
manufactured;
it
just
means
that
payment
of
the
wages
has
to
be
made
at
some
point,
and
if
it's
made
at
some
point
the
goods
have
not
been
manufactured
in
violation
of
the
act.
at
least
there's
a
linguistic
way
to
get
there,
isn't
there?
justice
scalia
mr.
rothfeld,
am
i
correct
that
it
is
also
common
ground
between
you
and
mr.
lee
that
there
is
going
to
be
a
frustration
of
the
bankruptcy
laws
by
reason
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
in
a
lot
of
situations?
that
is,
whenever
you
have
an
employer
who
has
intentionally
violated
the
act
and
has
contracted
to
pay
substandard
wages
and
then
goes
into
bankruptcy,
those
employees,
you
both
agree,
have
preference
over
other
creditors
if
the
goods
are
ever
going
to
be
sold;
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
all
right.
on
the
assumption
that
it
amounts
to
priorities
in
bankruptcy,
there
are
going
to
be
a
lot
of
cases
where
that
happens,
and
we're
arguing
here
not
about
bringing
order
into
the
whole
scheme
of
things,
but
just
whether
one
little
corner
of
disorder
is
going
to
be
eliminated.
justice
scalia
the
goal
itself
is
offended
by
these--
justice
scalia
--these
wicked
goods
being
in
interstate
commerce?
it's
a
sort
of
conceptual
problem
they
have
about
evil
goods
just
being
there
in
the
stream?
you
don't
really
think
that
that--
justice
scalia
--it's
a
public
policy,
we
don't
want
these
offensive
goods
moving?
surely
there
was
some
human
objective.
justice
scalia
do
you
have
any
cases
in
which,
never
mind
bankruptcy,
but
you
just
have
had
an
employer
who
has
not
paid
his
employees?
he
contracted
with
them
to
pay
above
the
minimum
wage,
but
he
failed
to
pay
them.
and
i
asked
mr.
lee
the
same
question
and
he
said
that
he
doesn't
think
the
law
is
clear
on
it.
is
the
law
clear?
justice
scalia
if
they're
sued
for
back
pay,
why
do
you
have
to
use
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
if
he's
promised
to
pay
it
it
doesn't
matter
whether
he
is
legally
obliged
to
promise
to
pay
it.
i
don't
know
why
you'd
have
to
bring
a
suit
for
back
pay.
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
the
sg's
office
isn't
promising
not
to
cite
holy
trinity
to
us
in
the
future?
justice
scalia
mr.
lee,
you
do
acknowledge
that
you
have
got
a
problem
with
the
bankruptcy
act
in
the
case
where...
i
mean,
assuming
that
this
affects
priorities,
you
have
a
problem
where
the
employer
has
intentionally
paid
substandard
wages.
now,
why
shouldn't
we
correct
that
impingement--
justice
scalia
--oh,
you
say
that
even
where
the
employer
has
contracted,
and
not
because
of
insolvency
but
he's
been
a
bad
actor
all
along,
he's
contracted
for
substandard
wages,
if
he
later
goes
into
bankruptcy
you
think
that
even
those
goods
can
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce?
justice
scalia
once
they're
in
the
hands?
justice
scalia
i
see.
justice
scalia
okay.
i
didn't
understand
that.
justice
scalia
the
only
cases
in
200
years
in
which
you
think
congress
has
written
a
statute
that
picks
up
something
that
maybe,
had
they
thought
about
it,
they
wouldn't
have
wanted
to
pick
it
up,
and
we
caught
both
of
them?
[laughter]
all
three.
