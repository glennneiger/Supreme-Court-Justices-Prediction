chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-88,
citicorp
industrial
credit
versus
william
e.
brock.
mr.
lee,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
it
seem
to
you
like
a
bad
statement
of
the
law,
what
you
just
read?
chief
justice
rehnquist
--well,
you
say
he
was
paying
the
minimum
wage
but
went
broke.
i
take
it
you
would
add
that
a
few
weeks
before
he
went
broke
he
didn't
pay
the
minimum
wage
because
he
was
unable
to?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
you
would
put
up
a
means
test
a
defense
for
any
employer
sued
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
chief
justice
rehnquist
this
doesn't
take
away
the
property
of
the
secured
creditor.
it
just
says
he
can't
ship
it
in
interstate
commerce.
chief
justice
rehnquist
granted,
that
makes
it
largely
valueless.
but
it's
not
like
a
lien
statute
that
says
the
property
passes
from
a
to
b.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
there
is,
it
seems
to
me,
a
considerable
difference
between
some
item
that's
perhaps
made
out
of
flammable
fabrics
and
is
simply
dangerous,
branded
so
by
the
statutory
scheme,
and
say
an
automobile
that
may
have
been
manufactured
by
a
bankrupt
automobile
company,
that
the
last
couple
weeks
didn't
pay
minimum
wages.
that
automobile
is
a
source
of
value
somewhere,
and
you
certainly
want
to
find
some
way
that
you
can
cure
whatever
defect
there
was
and
get
it
back
in
commerce,
in
a
way
that
you
don't
with
a
flammable
fabric.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
certainly
we
shouldn't
strain
to
reach
a
result
that
says
congress
intended
that
these
particular
goods
simply
rot
here
because
their
defect
can't
be
cured
and
they
can't
be
shipped,
if
there's
nothing
really
inherently
wrong
with
the
goods.
if
congress
says
that's
the
result,
now
that's
what
has
to
obtain.
but
you
don't
certainly
strain
to
reach
that
result.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
was
in
the
tradition
of
a
lot
of
these
acts,
the
webb-kenyon
act,
the
asher-summers
act,
that
all
described
the
tainted
goods
interstate
commerce.
that
was
the
way
congress
got
at
them.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
do
you
feel,
if
you
had
the
choice
between
the
plain
language
and
the
legislative
history,
which
would
you
choose?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
mr.
lee,
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
