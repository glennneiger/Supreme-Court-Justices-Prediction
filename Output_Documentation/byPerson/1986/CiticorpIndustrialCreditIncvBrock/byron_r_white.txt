mr.
lee,
weren't
there
wage
priorities
in
the
1938
bankruptcy
act?
didn't
unpaid
wages
have
a
degree
of
priority?
justice
white
yes,
yes.
but
that
was
subsequent
to
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
i
take
it.
justice
white
at
least
there's
an
inconsistency,
you
say,
between
the
bankruptcy
act
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
justice
white
and
i
suppose
one
argument
is
that
the
bankruptcy
act
impliedly
repealed
it
or,
if
the
fair
labor
standards
act
came
afterwards,
it
really
didn't
intend
to
repeal
the
bankruptcy
act.
justice
white
well,
they
can't
sell
it
in
intrastate
commerce
if
they
think
the
seller
is
going
to
sell
it
in
interstate
commerce.
justice
white
or
without
paying
them
at
least,
which
gives
the
wage
earners
a
priority
in
bankruptcy.
justice
white
xxx
as
a
matter
of
law,
is
that
it,
not
just
discretion?
justice
white
that's
the
way
you
put
it,
anyway,
although
the
law
doesn't
say
that.
justice
white
he's
trying
to
help
you
a
little.
of
course,
if
you
follow
that
argument
you
might
prove
these
goods
were
not
manufactured
in
violation
of
the
act,
because
they
might
have
had
a
practice
of
shipping
the
goods
out
before
the
end
of
the
week
when
the
payroll
was
due.
justice
white
do
you
have
cases
where
the
employer
has
also
been
forbidden
to
ship
his
inventory
in
interstate
commerce,
just
because
he
hasn't
paid
wages
which
were
above
the
minimum?
justice
white
that
would
be
sort
of
self-defeating,
wouldn't
it?
you
say,
you
must
pay
your
wages
before
you
can
ship
your
goods
and
get
the
money
to
pay
them.
justice
white
of
course,
of
course.
justice
white
so
i
ask
you,
are
there
some
cases
where
the
employer
has
been
forbidden
to
ship
his
goods
in
interstate
commerce
or
to
sell
the
goods
until
he's
paid
unpaid
wages?
justice
white
would
it
be
consistent
with
the
plain
language
of
the
act
if
the
employer
produced
a
bunch
of
goods
and
put
it
in
a
warehouse
and
half
of
the
goods
in
the
warehouse
were
produced
while
he
was
paying
his
employees
and
half
of
the
goods
were
produced
when
he
wasn't;
could
he
ship
the
goods
that
were
produced
while
he
was
paying
his
wages?
