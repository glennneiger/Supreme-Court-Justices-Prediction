mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
the
competing
claims
of
creditors
to
proceeds
of
an
insolvent
debtor's
collateral.
the
question
presented
is
whether
congress
when
it
enacted
the
fair
labor
standards
act
of
1938
intended
not
only
to
prevent
employers
from
paying
unconscionably
low
wages,
but
also
to
repeal
otherwise
applicable
state
and
federal
laws
governing
the
lien
priorities
of
wage
earners
vis
a
vis
other
creditors
where
the
employer
becomes
insolvent
and
therefore
fails
to
meet
his
payroll
just
before
he
goes
out
of
business.
the
legal
issue
in
the
case
arises
out
of
the
following
facts.
the
petitioner,
citicorp
industrial
credit,
financed
the
manufacturing
operations
of
a
now
defunct
entity
known
as
the
ely
group
under
an
ordinary
secured
financing
arrangement
that
gave
petitioner
a
security
interest,
which
petitioner
properly
perfected,
in
ely's
accounts
receivable
and
inventory.
approximately
one-year
later,
ely
went
out
of
business,
defaulted
on
its
obligations
to
petitioner,
and
also
failed
to
meet
its
payrolls
in
the
last
weeks
of
its
operation.
two
district
courts
found...
and
this
is
a
quote
from
both
of
those
opinions...
that:
"both
the
employees
and
the
secured
creditor
are
innocent
parties,
the
culprit
being
the
manufacturer.
"
factually,
therefore,
the
case
fits
the
classic
insolvency
mold:
no
creditor
is
at
fault,
the
debtor's
assets
are
insufficient
to
satisfy
all
creditors,
some
will
be
paid
and
some
will
not.
so
that
the
crucial
practical
question
becomes,
how
do
you
determine
which
claims
will
be
paid,
which
will
be
paid
ahead
of
the
others,
and
what
law
governs
that
priority.
the
secretary
and
the
lower
courts
contend
that
that
question
is
answered
by
our
minimum
wage
and
hour
law,
and
that
the
flsa
resolves
this
issue
in
favor
of
the
unsecured
wage
claimants
because
the
flsa's
so-called
hot
goods
provision,
section
15(a)(1),
permits
any
person
from
shipping
goods
produced
in
violation
of
the
act.
that
view,
if
adopted
by
this
court,
is
going
to
work
some
very
large
changes
in
state
and
federal
statutes
that
specifically
deal
with
the
priorities
of
creditors'
claims
in
cases
of
insolvency,
notwithstanding
the
fact
that
even
the
government
agrees
that
there
is
no
evidence
congress
intended
that
result.
everyone
agrees
that
congress
has
never
considered
whether
the
hot
goods
provision
should
apply
to
secured
creditors.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was...
it
has
come
up
at
least
twice...
well,
several
times.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
enacted
in
1938.
so
far
as
i
can
tell...
and
the
best
authority
on
this
is
the
second
circuit's
decision
in
powell
knitting,
which
was
the
first
case
to
reach
it
in
1966...
for
the
first
quarter
of
a
century
the
secretary
did
not
take
the
position
that
he
takes
today.
and
indeed,
if
you
look
at
that
part
of
our
brief
that
deals
with
a
statement
on
how
to
insure
against
hot
goods
that
the
secretary
published
early
in
the
game,
that
was
not
his
position.
the
first
effort
to
take
this
position,
to
apply
it
against
secured
creditors,
apparently
occurred
about
a
quarter
of
a
century
after
it
was
enacted,
in
the
mid-1960's.
and
on
that
occasion
the
second
circuit
rejected
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
congress
has
amended
the
act
substantively,
has
amended
the
hot
goods
provision,
once.
that
amendment,
in
1949,
was
to
correct
an
erroneous
interpretation
by
the
administrator
as
to
its
reach.
and
i
prefer
not
to
go
into
all
the
detail
of
that
legislative
history
here,
but
as
set
forth
in
our
brief
it
is
just
quite
clear
that
what
congress
was
doing
simply
correcting
one
erroneous
interpretation
by
the
secretary.
now,
insofar
as
the
language
is
concerned,
the
strongest
argument
that
the
government
has
is
the
"any
person"
argument.
this
is
not
the
first
time,
however,
that
this
court
has
been
called
upon
to
consider
a
congressional
statute
whose
literal
language
reached
any
person
or
any
case,
and
the
court
has
held
that,
though
the
language
fit,
it
was
not
the
kind
of
case
that
congress
wanted
to
cover
with
its
statute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
there
is
a
real
difference,
justice
scalia,
between
the
kind
of
circumstance
where
congress
simply
came
up
against
the
issue
and
there
were
competing
views
on
both
sides,
neither
side
had
the
votes,
and
as
a
consequence
they
simply
dodged
it,
and
both
sides
made
a
lot
of
legislative
history
and
then
left
it
for
this
court
to
fill
in
the
details...
i
think
that's
one
circumstance.
it
is
quite
another
circumstance
where
congress,
in
order
to
achieve
one
objective,
used
some
language
that
was
maybe
a
little
bit
broader
than
it
should
have
achieved...
or
than
it
might
have
used,
and
then
later
on
there
is
a
circumstance
that
everyone
agrees
congress
has
simply
never
focused
on.
and
it
is
particularly
different
where
the
effect
of
that
interpretation
is
going
to
be
to
displace
some
state
and
federal
laws
that
have
specifically
focused
on
the
issue.
the
leading
case
on
this
issue...
and
frankly,
the
more
i
look
at
it,
the
more
i
conclude
it
is
this
case...
is
this
holy
trinity
case.
that
involved
also
a
federal
statute,
and
it
was
a
federal
statute
which
prohibited
the
importation
of
any
person,
any
person,
for
the
purpose
of
performing
labor
within
the
united
states.
and
then
it
provided
exceptions,
and
there
were
exceptions
for
actors,
lecturers,
teachers,
but
not
exceptions
for
ministers
of
the
gospel.
and
the
holy
trinity
church
brought
in
a
reverend
walpole
for
the
purpose
of
preaching
to
their
congregation,
and
the
secretary...
or,
excuse
me...
the
united
states
of
america
brought
suit,
contending
that
the
statute
was
violated.
and
they
won
in
the
lower
court.
the
argument
they
made
when
they
came
to
this
court,
argument
by
mr.
william
a.
maury,
assistant
attorney
general
of
the
united
states,
was
that:
where
the
meaning
of
a
statute
is
plain
it
is
the
duty
of
the
court
to
enforce
it
according
to
its
obvious
terms;
in
such
case,
there
is
no
necessity
for
construction.
the
case
really
comes
down
to
this,
we
submit--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--what
i
just
read,
of
course,
whether
it
is
good
or
bad,
was
the
statement
that
was
rejected
by
this
court
in
holy
trinity.
and
they
held,
in
that
very
famous
language,
that
it
may
be
within
the
technical
language,
yet
if
it
is
outside
what
congress
was
obviously
thinking
about
the
narrow
language
may
not
govern.
the
reason
that
it
is
particularly
compelling,
we
submit,
that
you
not
apply
the
literal
language
in
this
instance
is
as
follows.
it
is
agreed
on
all
sides
that
congress
has
never
squarely
dealt
with
the
question
whether
in
insolvency
wage
claims
ought
to
come
ahead
of
secured
creditors.
it
did
not
specifically
intend,
therefore,
a
change,
to
effect
a
change
in
the
state
and
federal
laws
that
specifically
deal
with
that
issue.
yet,
a
specific,
focused
congressional
intent
is
exactly
what
this
court's
cases
make
very
clear
is
required
before
state
and
federal
law
otherwise
applicable
can
be
displaced.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i'm
not
sure,
i'm
not
sure.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
and
i
would
think
it
probably
would
only
be
the
minimum
wage.
but
the
fact
is
that
either
way
the
entity
that
is
in
first
place--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--there
would
be
some
money
left,
but
insofar
as
the
theory
is
concerned
it
would
have
changed
around,
it
would
have
altered
the
priorities
that
are
otherwise
provided
for,
because
the
basic
policy
question
is
whose
lien
should
be
first,
which
claim
should
be
first,
in
those
instances
where
there
is
not
enough
money
to
go
around.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
don't
know
that
that
is
that
clear,
and
that
is
another
issue
that...
as
far
as
i
know,
that
is
an
issue
that
has
simply
never
been
decided.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
not
to
my
knowledge,
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
indeed,
one
of
our
positions
is...
you
don't
have
to
go
quite
that
far...
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
simply
never
intended
to
apply
to
instances
where
the
employer
was
paying
the
minimum
wage,
there
is
no
question
that
he
was
paying
the
$3.35
an
hour,
but
he
simply
went
out
of
business
and
went
broke,
and
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
never
intended--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
it
is
simply
another
approach,
another
view
that
we
think
supports
our
position,
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
not
intended
to
apply
to
the
insolvency
circumstance,
for
a
couple
of
reasons.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
that's
basically
the
government's
argument.
we
think
it's
insufficient,
for
a
couple
of
reasons,
because
frankly
my
client
just
doesn't
take
much
comfort
from
the
government's
assurance
that
the
sixth
circuit's
interpretation
here
does
not
create
a
lien,
because
the
reality
is
that
under
the
sixth
circuit's
rule
citicorp's
first
priority
lien
that
it
enjoys
because
of
article
9
of
the
uniform
commercial
code,
which
would
otherwise
govern
but
for
the
sixth
circuit's
ruling,
does
it
no
good
unless
it
first
pays
off
another
batch
of
unsecured
junior
creditors.
so
that
the
effect,
though
not
the
label
that
goes
on
it
and
not
the
concept...
and
that's
part
of
our
argument,
that
since
this
was
not
the
intent
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
it
shouldn't
apply
to
this
circumstance.
but
the
effect
is
not
only
to
create
a
wage
earner's
lien,
but
also
to
move
that
new
lien
ahead
of
secured
creditors.
now,
there
is
also
a
batch
of
federal
statutes
that
will
necessarily
be
affected
by
the
secretary's
interpretation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
they
include:
the
bankruptcy
act,
which,
like
the
ucc,
gives
secured
creditors
priority
over
unpaid
wage
earners;
the
federal
tax
lien
act,
under
which
either
the
secretary
of
the
treasury
or
his
delegate,
usually
the
irs
district
director,
both
of
whom
are
clearly
persons,
have
the
responsibility
of
levying
and
enforcing
federal
tax
liens;
and
two
other
federal
statutes
that
give
the
unpaid
sellers
of
livestock
and
perishable
agricultural
commodities
a
priority
over
other
creditors,
including
employees
whose
wages
have
not
been
paid.
the
government
observes,
and
correctly
so,
that
this
case
does
not
involve
bankruptcy
and
does
not
involve
any
of
those
other
statutes.
but
the
point
is
that
the
literal
interpretation
of
"any
person"
which
the
government
seeks
will
necessarily
change
a
lot
of
lien
statutes
that
would
otherwise
be
applicable
in
this
circumstance.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
think
he
had
taken
the
opposite
position.
there
is
not
a
lot
of
evidence
as
to
the
position
that
he
had
taken.
i
refer
you
to
powell
knitting,
the
second
circuit
decision
which
was
the
first
one
to
come
up
in
1966,
and
that
case
observes
that
this
is
apparently
the
first
time
the
secretary
has
taken
this
position.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
he
had
previously
in
our
view
taken
exactly
the
opposite
position.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
was
in
the
form,
justice
brennan,
of
a
statement
in
a...
the
bna
put
put
a
manual
called
a
manual
for
fair
labor
standards
act
compliance,
and
there
was
a
statement
in
that
manual
that
dealt
with
insurance
against
hot
goods.
and
in
that
manual
the
secretary
took
the
position...
it
told
you
how
you
could
get
insurance
against
hot
goods,
and
basically
where
it
came
out
was
that
you
could
get
insurance
against
hot
goods
if
you
could
show
that
you
had
acted
in
good
faith.
it
used
the
example
of
those
who
bought...
lumber
processors
who
bought
from
mills,
and
said
that
if
they
would
monitor
the
flsa
compliance
of
the
lumber
mills
then
that
would
be
insurance
against
hot
goods.
now,
under
the
provision...
under
the
position
that
the
government
takes
today,
there
is
no
insurance
against
hot
goods.
if
they
are
hot
at
one
time,
they
simply
remain
hot
and
no
amount
of
insurance...
or,
excuse
me...
no
amount
of
innocence
will
change
that.
now,
the
government
takes
the
position
that
what
that
manual
said...
or,
not
what
the
manual,
what
the
insurance
against
hot
goods
was
talking
about
was
criminal
prosecution.
and
i
simply
submit
that
there
is
no
way
that
that
particular
provision
can
be
read
that
way,
because
what
it
talks
about
is
goods
that
are
in
the
hands
of
the
creditor
and
that
he
can't
ship
them
and
how
to
avoid
that
circumstance.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
one.
it
was
the
fourth
circuit's
decision
in
a
case
called
shultz
versus
factors,
inc.--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--'71.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
'71.
and
in
that
case,
the
fourth
circuit
agreed
with
the
second,
but
added
one
additional
provision,
with
which
we
agree,
and
that
is
that
there
must
not
be
any
complicity,
any
collusion,
between
the
creditor
and
the
employer.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
you
know,
they
go
for
a
quarter
of
a
century
and
they
don't
do
anything,
and
then
they
lose
in
'66,
and
then
they
lose
again
in
'71.
i
am
not
aware...
and
there
was
one
other
one
that
they
lost,
a
district
court
decision
under
secretary
dunlop.
the
first...
they
do
not
have
any
victories
other
than
in
the
sixth
circuit
before
the
1980's.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
all
of
their
victories
have
been
sixth
circuit
victories,
and
they've
all
come
in
the
1980's.
the
other
federal
statutes
that
will
be
affected
are
these
two
that
deal
with
the
trusts
that
are
imposed
on
the
sellers
of
perishable
agricultural
commodities
and
of
livestock
by
federal
statutes.
the
point
is
that
the
wage
and
hour
law
need
not
be
interpreted
in
such
a
way
that
it
alters
lien
priorities,
and
it
should
not
be.
it's
a
point
that
is
further
underscored
by
the
government's
reliance
on
the
flammable
fabrics
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
let
me
give
you
three
brief
answers.
the
first
is,
it's
an
old
chestnut
but
a
good
one.
it's
been
around
for
a
long
time
and
it's
entitled
to
some
respect.
and
i
submit,
it
is
indistinguishable.
they
were
doing
exactly
the
same
thing.
they
were
bringing
people
here,
and
it
fairly
fit
the
statute
that
says
that
any
person...
it's
unlawful
to
import
any
person
any
alien,
for
those
purposes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no.
that
is,
the
court
did,
the
court
did.
the
statute
made
an
exception,
made
about
six
exceptions,
and
ministers
did
not
fit
any
single
one
of
those
exceptions.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
they
certainly
didn't
say
so.
it's
strictly
a
matter
of
statutory
interpretation.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
no.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
good
spirit
of
true
adjudication,
they
decided
only
that
case
that
was
before
them
at
that
particular
instance.
but
there
was
an
exception
for
lecturers,
there
was
an
exception
for
teachers,
there
was
an
exception
for
domestics,
and
several
others.
the
second
answer
is
that
that
isn't
the
only
case.
there
is
another
one
that
we
think
is
right
on
point.
unfortunately,
we
didn't
find
it
until
we
were
preparing
for
oral
argument,
though
i
have
advised
mr.
rothfeld
of
that
right
after
we
found
it.
it's
a
1975
decision
by
this
court.
i
would
pronounce
it
muniz
versus
hoffman,
and
it
also
arose
out
of
the
labor
context.
it
involved
the
question
of
jury
trial,
jury
trial
for
an
individual
who
was
convicted
of
contempt
because
of
a
violation
of
a
court's
order
pending...
for
an
injunction
pending
determination
of
that
issue
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
and
the
statute
says
that
in
any
case
involving
or
growing
out
of
a
labor
dispute
the
accused
shall
enjoy
the
right
to
a
speedy
trial.
this
court,
relying
on
holy
trinity,
said:
"it
is
not
unusual
that
exceptions
to
the
applicability
of
a
statute's
otherwise
all-inclusive
language
are
not
contained
in
the
enactment
itself,
but
are
found
in
another
statute
dealing
with
particular
situations
to
which
the
first
statute
might
otherwise
apply.
"
all
i'm
saying
is
that
there
is
good
precedent
for
not
extending
the
"any
person"
language
where
it's
going
to
have
the
kind
of
mischievous
effects
that
it's
going
to
have
here.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
junior
to
secured
creditor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
well,
there
is
a
very--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that's
exactly
right,
and
that
is
one
of
the
most
powerful
arguments
for
congress'
real
intent
that
there
is
in
this
whole
case.
it
so
happens
that
the
chandler
act,
which
re-enacted
provisions
of...
it
was
an
amendment
to
the
bankruptcy
act,
was
enacted
just
three
days
before
the
fair
labor
standards
act,
and
it
continued
in
effect
the
same
preference
that
had
existed
from
the
beginning
in
the
bankruptcy
act
of
secured
creditor
over
unpaid
wage
claims.
does
anyone
really
seriously
think
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
but
let's
go
back
for
just
a
moment
to
the
question
that
you
just
asked--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
that
is
correct.
and
given
this
court's
interpretation
of
interstate
commerce,
we're
prevented
from
selling
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
probably
not,
probably
not.
the
point
is
that,
just
as
you
referred
to
a
moment
ago,
justice
scalia,
in
connection
with
how
many
exceptions
are
carved
out,
your
ruling
in
this
case
as
to
any
person,
if
it
means
secured
creditors,
i
don't
see
how
you
can
stop
it
from
meaning
trustees
in
bankruptcy.
and
i
don't
believe
that
anyone
can
seriously
say
that
congress
three
days
after
it
passed
the
chandler
act
intended
to
reverse
those
lien
priorities
that
were
effected
there.
and
i
also
don't
think--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--i
would
not
put
it
that
way.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
would
not
put
it
that
congress
cannot
make
a
mistake.
i
would
rather
say
that
in
melding
together
the
rules
dealing
with
preemption
and
repeal
by
implication,
and
applying
both
the
muniz
case
and
also
the
holy
trinity
case,
that
in
those
instances
where
everyone
agrees
that
congress
simply
didn't
face
or
decide
these
kinds
of
issues
that
you're
not
going
to
preempt
inadvertently
nor
repeal
by
implication
inadvertently
when
there
is
another
interpretation.
mr.
chief
justice,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
one
objective
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
was
to
force
the
payment
of
minimum
wages
by
chiseling
employers,
and
it
had
one
other
objective
which
was
supportive
thereof,
and
that
was
to
take
away
the
competitive
advantage
in
interstate
commerce
that
the
substandard
employers
would
enjoy
vis
a
vis
those
who
had
paid
standard
wages.
you
do
not
get
at
that
objective
by
requiring
third
parties
whose
only
leverage
existed
because
of
something
they
did
a
year
before
the
insolvency
occurs.
mr.
rothfeld
has
conceded,
as
of
course
he
must,
that
there
is
a
conflict
between
the
substantive
provisions
of
the
bankruptcy
act,
which
deal
with
creditors'
priorities,
and
the
fair
labor
standards
act
as
it
would
be
interpreted
here.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
not
where
it's
intentionally,
but
where
there's
been
some
complicity
between
the
creditor
and
the
employer.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
once
they're
in
the
hands--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
as
they
are...
as
he
has
exercised
his
secured
lien,
unless
there
is
some
complicity,
unless
there
is
some
fault
on
the
part
of
the
secured
creditor.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
there
is
no
question
that
congress
has
the
power
to
repeal
state
and
federal
laws
dealing
with
these
lien
priorities
and
to
move
wage
creditors
to
the
head
of
the
line.
but
this
court
said
just
last
year
in
bowen
versus
american
hospital
association
that
the
implications
and
limitations
of
our
federal
system
constitute
a
major
premise
of
all
congressional
legislation
and
that
congress
will
not
be
deemed
to
have
displaced
state
law
unless
otherwise
the
purpose
of
the
act
would
be
defeated.
at
a
very
minimum,
we
submit
that
means
that
in
making
decisions
such
as
in
this
case
some
kind
of
a
comparative
balance
of
the
comparative
impact
on
state
and
federal
laws
must
be
taken
into
account.
that
does
not
mean
that
we
are
taking
the
position
that
congress
did
not
know
what
it
was
doing.
we
are
simply
saying
that
in
every
instance
that
i
am
aware
of
in
which
the
court
has
faced
the
identical
situation
in
this
case,
congress
was
aiming
at
a
particular
problem,
used
language
that
would
sweep
in
a
few
other
instances,
this
court
has
not
simply
woodenly
said,
therefore
those
other
instances
were
also
legislated
unintentionally.
the
only
cases
that
deal
with
it
so
far
as
i
am
aware
are
holy
trinity...
and
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
distinguish
holy
trinity...
this
muniz
case,
and
then
there
is
a
case
that
comes
fairly
close
to
it,
this
court's
recent
decision
in
the
jersey
shore
bank
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
but
the
point
is
that
in
every
instance
where
you
caught
it,
you
were
consistent.
you
were
consistent
in
what
you
did.
and
all
i'm
asking
is
that
you
be
consistent
for
a
fourth
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
oh,
johnson,
i
do
know
the
johnson
case,
i
do
know
the
johnson
case.
it's
an
entirely
different--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
goes
back
to
the
conversation
that
i
had
with
justice
scalia.
may
i
answer
the
question,
mr.
chief
justice?
it
goes
back
to
the
conversation
that
i
had
earlier
with
justice
scalia.
there
is
a
difference
between
the
circumstances
where
congress
was
facing
either
one
interpretation
or
the
other
and
didn't
actually
make
it
clear
which
it
was
doing.
that's
the
johnson
and
the
weber
circumstance,
at
least
as
i
read
johnson
and
weber.
this
is
a
circumstance
that
is
quite
different,
where
congress
used
language
that
no
one
contends,
no
one
contends,
was
intended
to
be
applicable.
