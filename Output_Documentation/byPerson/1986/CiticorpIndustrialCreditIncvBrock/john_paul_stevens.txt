justice
stevens
in
what
form
did
he
take
it?
justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question
about
the
history.
what
about
the
period
between
the
second
circuit
case
and
the
few
cases
recently?
was
there
any
litigation
in
the
seventies,
for
example?
justice
stevens
wasn't
that
in
the
eighties?
justice
stevens
that
was
'71.
justice
stevens
but
between
that
decision
and
this
one,
was
there
litigation
all
through
the
seventies?
i
thought
there
was
a
period
where
the
government
sort
of
threw
in
the
towel.
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
mr.
rothfeld,
does
the
statute
provide
for
that
cure?
justice
stevens
that
is
something
that
has
been
added
to
the
language
of
the
statute.
if
you
read
the
statute
literally,
that
cure
would
be
impermissible,
would
it
not?
justice
stevens
because
the
goods
were
produced
in
violation
of
the
statute.
justice
stevens
so
how...
where
does
the
secretary
get
the
authority
to
okay
a
cure
of
that
kind,
in
plain
violation
of
the
language
of
the
statute?
justice
stevens
xxx
in
any
way.
justice
stevens
well,
why
is
that
any
different
from
reading
into
the
statute
an
exception
for
a
business
that
just
goes
out
of
business
and
there's
no
ongoing
violation,
which
is
what
congress
was
obviously
really
thinking
about?
justice
stevens
no,
it
says
no
one
can
sell
goods
which
were
produced
under
these
conditions.
and
they
were
produced
in
violation
of
the
statute
under
your
view,
because
the
employees
were
not
paid.
justice
stevens
so
the
secretary
would
have
had
authority,
if
it
wanted
to,
over
these
intervening
years,
simply
not
to
enforce
this
provision
in
bankruptcy
situations?
justice
stevens
the
statute
doesn't
require
it.
it's
entirely
up
to
the
secretary
either
to
bring
cases
like
this
or
not.
justice
stevens
xxx.
justice
stevens
do
you
agree
with
your
opponent's
view
that
the
same
plain
language
argument
would
apply
to
the
bankruptcy
trustee?
justice
stevens
so
if
a
bankruptcy
trustee,
say,
comes
into
possession
of
a
large
inventory
of
goods
that
have
to
be
liquidated,
he
may
not
liquidate
them,
at
least
in
interstate
commerce,
period?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
there
are
a
lot
of
bankruptcy
situations
in
which
you
get
the
secured
creditor,
i'm
sure,
claiming
the
right
to
dispose
of
goods.
it's
not
an
unusual--
justice
stevens
--i
don't
see
why
not,
if
the
rule
is
that...
all
the
policy
reasons
supporting
the
government's
position
would
apply
equally
in
an
ordinary
bankruptcy,
without
any
secured
creditors.
justice
stevens
do
you
think,
mr.
rothfeld,
in
the
flammable
fabrics
example
that
you
have
discretion
to
permit
these
dangerous
products
to
be
shipped
in
interstate
commerce?
is
there
a
difference
between
the
flammable,
violations
of
the
flammable
fabrics
act
and
this
kind
of
"hot
goods"?
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
think
that
the
secretary
would
have
discretion
to
say,
well,
we
realize
these
are
very
dangerous,
but
we're
too
busy
to
enforce
this
statute?
justice
stevens
there
is
some
difference
between
the
two?
justice
stevens
you
say
we
all
agree.
i
don't
agree
with
that
at
all.
justice
stevens
it's
plainly
in
violation
of
the
statute
if
one's
going
to
read
it
literally.
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
maybe
you
agreed
too
readily
that
the
goods
are
manufactured
in
violation
of
the
statute,
if
the
proper
wages
are
not
paid
before
they
are
rolling
off
the
press.
i
mean,
what
if
the
wages
are
paid
in
arrears
and
goods
are
manufactured
before
the
monetary
payment
has
been
made?
does
it
never
occur
that
goods
are
shipped
in
interstate
commerce
before
the
workers
who
produced
those
goods
picked
up
their
paycheck?
justice
stevens
mr.
rothfeld,
supposing
you
got
an
accumulation
of
inventory
that
was
manufactured
without
the
payroll
being
met
for
three
or
four
weeks,
and
there
are
not
enough
assets
in
the
estate
to
make
up
the
wage
shortage
so
the
goods
could...
you
could
not
generate
enough
money
to
comply
with
the
statute.
i
take
it
under
your
view
they
could
never
be
shipped?
you'd
just
have
to
burn
them.
justice
stevens
it
depends
on
how
long
this
has
been
accumulating.
justice
stevens
they
may
have
shipped
90
percent
of
those,
but
then
the
ten
percent
that's
left
over
in
inventory
is
not
enough
to
pay
for
the
full,
you
know,
the
full
amount
of
the
arrearage.
that
could
happen.
justice
stevens
so
the
trustee
would
just
have
to
dispose
of
those
goods,
even
though
it's
highly
uneconomic?
justice
stevens
mr.
rothfeld,
in
the
normal
violation
situation
doesn't
the
employee
have
a
claim
against
his
employer
for
a
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act?
justice
stevens
but
he
doesn't
have
a
right
to
invoke
this
particular
provision?
justice
stevens
and
the
purpose
of
that
is
to
prevent
the
goods
going
into
the
market
at
depressed
prices
because
they
were
produced
at
depressed
wages,
i
suppose.
justice
stevens
but
one
of
the
things
is
unfair
competition
to
the
employers
who
pay
a
decent
wage
scale.
justice
stevens
and
of
course,
that
purpose
would
not
be
served
by
the
sale
of
these
goods
anyway,
even
after
the
wages
are
paid.
they're
going
to
be
sold
no
doubt
at
a
great
discount
because
it's
a
liquidation
of
an
inventory.
justice
stevens
so
that
purpose
isn't
served
no
matter
which
way
we
decide
this
case.
justice
stevens
of
course,
that
rhetoric
applies
to
an
ongoing
business
doing
it
month
after
month
after
month.
it
doesn't
really
apply
to
a
liquidation
of
a
bankrupt,
inventory
in
a
bankruptcy,
does
it?
justice
stevens
don't
you
get
the
same
price
whether
the
employees
were
paid
or
not?
the
rhetoric
just
doesn't
fit.
justice
stevens
within
the
period
between
1938
and
1966,
this
fact
pattern
surely
arose
many,
many
times.
justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
may
i
ask
you,
do
you
think
the
johnson
case
we
decided
the
other
day
is
such
a
case,
the
weber
case
is
such
a
case?
justice
stevens
the
language
is
pretty
clear
there,
wasn't
it?
