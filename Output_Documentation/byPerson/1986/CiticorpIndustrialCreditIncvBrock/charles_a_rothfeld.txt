mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
not
about
secret
liens
or
state
insolvency
laws
or
priorities
in
bankruptcy,
as
citicorp
has
argued
this
morning.
it
is
about
the
meaning
of
a
completely
unambiguous
statute,
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
now,
when
it
has
talked
about
the
act
at
all,
citicorp
has
painted
a
picture
that
is
a
caricature
of
what
was
and
is
a
dramatic
piece
of
legislation.
the
act
is
written
in
the
broadest
possible
terms.
it
makes
it
illegal
for
any
person
to
sell
hot
goods
in
interstate
commerce
until
those
goods
are
cured.
and
justice
o'connor,
in
response
to
your
question,
the
goods
are
cured
by
the
payment
of
the
minimum
wage,
not
all
wages
due
the
employees.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
that
has
been
the
secretary's
interpretation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
statute,
as
you
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that's
true.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
the
secretary's
interpretation
is
not
in
plain
violation
of
the
language
of
the
statute.
the
secretary
has
taken
the
position
that
the
goods
essentially
are
tainted,
are
hot,
because
they
were
produced
under
substandard
labor
conditions.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true,
justice
stevens,
the
statute
doesn't
address
that
issue
at
all.
and
the
secretary's
reasoning,
i
think,
is
that
because
the
goods
were
produced
under
substandard
conditions,
the
taint
is
cured
if
the
conditions
are
essentially
corrected.
and
the
conditions
are
corrected
by
paying,
albeit
retroactively,
what
the
employees
were
due.
i
should
add
that
citicorp--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
that's
quite
different,
justice
stevens.
let
me
preface
my
answer
by
saying
citicorp
invited
this
relief
and
it
was
granted
by
the
district
courts,
the
court
of
appeals,
over
the
secretary's
objection.
the
secretary
did
not
agree
that
it
was
appropriate
to
stay
the
lower
court
judgments.
but
i
think
that
the
secretary
is
dealing
with
an
issue
which
simply
is
not
addressed
in
the
statute
at
all,
whether
or
not
the
taint
can
be
cured.
the
issue
here
that
citicorp
is
talking
about
is
quite
explicitly
dealt
with
in
the
statute.
the
statute
says
flatly
no
one
can
sell
hot
goods
in
interstate
commerce,
period.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
as
i
say,
justice
stevens,
that's
true.
and
the
secretary's
position...
well--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
that
is
one--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
one,
i
think
one
approach
to
what
the
secretary
is
doing.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
true.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
quite
right,
justice
stevens.
section
1501
is
not
self-enforcing.
it
can
only
be
brought
into
effect,
as
it
was
in
this
case,
by
an
action
for
injunction
under
section
17.
so
if
the
secretary--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--clearly
not,
clearly
not.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
think
so,
justice
stevens.
i
should
add--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me
say
several
things
about
that,
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
as
i
said,
there
are
several
responses
to
that
point,
justice
stevens.
first
of
all,
this
case
does
not
involve
bankruptcy,
so
all
of
citicorp's
arguments
about
bankruptcy
are
entirely
hypothetical.
and
anything
the
court
says
about
the
applicability--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--no,
that
is
true,
although
the
court's
decision
here
doesn't
necessarily
have
to
reach
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
actually
that
is
quite
right,
justice
stevens.
and
there
is
no
conflict
that
we
see
between
section
1501
and
priorities
in
bankruptcy,
for
several
reasons.
first
of
all,
the
bankruptcy
code
itself
recognizes
the
distinction
that
we
have
drawn
in
our
statute
between
regulatory
statutes
and
creditor's
rights
provisions.
section
362(b)(4)
and
(b)(5),
it
explicitly
permits
the
government
to
prosecute
an
action
to
enforce
an
injunctive...
obtain
injunctive
relief
when
necessary
to
enforce
public
law
requirements.
district
courts
and
bankruptcy
courts
have
uniformly
concluded
that
the
fair
labor
standards
act
is
precisely
that
sort
of
statute.
so
if
this
were
a
bankruptcy
case,
the
code
itself
would
permit
this
very
action
to
proceed
and
the
same
relief
to
be
awarded.
second
of
all,
we
don't
think
that
the
application
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act
here
affects
priorities
in
bankruptcy
at
all,
even
apart
from
the
section
362(b)(4)
and
(b)(5)
relief.
now,
we
talked
about
this
at
length
in
our
brief,
and
what
i
would
like
to
do,
with
your
indulgence,
is
explain
how
we
think
the
statute
operates
and
what
we
think
it
means,
because
that
i
think
answers
the
question
about
whether
or
not
this
affects
priorities
in
bankruptcy.
the
short
answer
is
that
as
a
statute
like
the
flammable
fabrics
act,
for
example,
which
we
cite
in
our
brief...
if
flammable
fabrics
turned
up
in
a
bankrupt
estate,
the
trustee
certainly
couldn't
claim
that
he
had
a
right
to
sell
those
fabrics
until
they
were
conformed
to
the
requirements
of
federal
law.
precisely
the
same
thing
is
true
here.
if
goods
that
were
tainted
because
they
were
produced
under
substandard
labor
conditions
turn
up
in
a
bankrupt
estate,
the
trustee
cannot
sell
them
until
he
satisfies
the
absolute
requirements
of
federal
law,
which
is
that
the
taint
be
removed.
now,
the
taint
is
removed
by
the
payment
of
wages,
essentially
remedying
the
substandard
labor
condition.
but
that
doesn't
affect
priorities
in
bankruptcy.
and
as
i
say,
i
think
as
i
outline
how
the
operation
of
the
statute
and
what
congress
meant
to
accomplish,
that
becomes
quite
clear.
i'd
like
to
talk
about,
i
think,
two
things.
first--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
the
secretary--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--that
is
how
i
put
it,
justice.
but
i
think
however
one
approaches
it,
the
priorities
in
bankruptcy,
priorities
under
state
insolvency
law,
are
simply
not--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
would
have
to
be
an
enforcement
action
of
some
sort.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
for
an
enforcement
official
to
do
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
but
the
nature
of
the
statutes
are
identical.
both
statutes
are
public
laws
that
create
general
regulatory
prohibitions
on
the
introduction
of
certain
goods
into
interstate
commerce,
for
particular
reasons,
until
those
reasons
are
removed,
whether
or
not
it's
a
question
of
enforcement
discretion
or
it's
simply
a
straightforward
interpretation
of
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
entirely
true,
as
a
flammable
fabric
can
be
cured,
can
be
brought
into
conformity
with
the
federal
standards.
the
flammable
fabric
is
not
without
value.
it
simply
is
of
reduced
value
because
it's
defective.
and
i
think
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
let
me
answer
that
in
two
ways,
justice
rehnquist.
first,
we
don't
suggest
that
that's
the
result
which
should
obtain
in
this
case.
i
think
we
all
agree
that
if
the
employees
are
paid,
if
the
statutory
requirements
are
satisfied,
the
goods
can
be
introduced
into
interstate
commerce.
the
secretary
won't
object
to
that.
second
of
all--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
should
say--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
should
say
the
parties,
i
think,
agree.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
and
as
to
whether
the
secretary
will
enforce
the
statute
under
those
circumstances,
i
think
it
is
clear
the
regulations
would
permit
these
goods
to
be
introduced
into
interstate
commerce.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
not
at
all,
justice
scalia.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
don't
think
that
that's
true,
justice
scalia.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that's
right,
justice
stevens.
and
the
result
that
the
act
ordains
is
quite
clear.
certainly
if
goods
are
produced,
in
the
normal
course
of
business
employees
are
not
paid
until
the
week
following
the
production
of
the
goods,
those
goods
are
not
hot
goods
during
the
week
prior
to
the
payment
of
the
employees.
but
if
the
employees
are
not
paid
in
the
normal
course
of
business,
if
in
this
case
they
are
not...
as
in
this
case,
they
are
not
paid
at
all,
certainly
there
is
a
violation
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
the
statute
says
flatly
on
its
face
in
section
6
that
every
employer
shall
pay
statutory
minimum
wage,
and
it
says
flatly
on
its
face
in
section
7
that
every
employer
cannot...
no
employer
can
work
its
employees
more
than
40
hours
a
week
unless
they--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
it
will
be
an
extraordinary
situation
where
the
goods
themselves
are
worth
less
than
the
value
of
the
labor
that
went
into
them.
if
that--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if
there
were
a
case--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
if
there
were
a
case
where
it
were
impossible
to
pay
the
employees
what
they
were
owed,
the
statutory
language
is
quite
clear.
congress
provided
that
no
person
shall
ship
hot
goods
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
as
i
say,
justice
stevens,
that
is
a
situation
which
i
think
is
unlikely
and
that's
demonstrated
by
the
fact
that
it
has
never
arisen
in
the
50
years
the
act
has
been
in
operation.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
answer
is
both
yes
and
no,
justice
scalia.
i
think
that
your
characterization
of
giving
the
employees
priority
and
characterization
of
this
as
affecting
priorities
in
bankruptcy
is
not
correct.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
let
me
give
you
two
answers
to
that.
first
of
all,
accepting
your
assumption,
it
is
true
that
this
does
not
disturb
generally
priorities
in
bankruptcy.
congress
was
legislating
with
a
particular
problem
in
mind,
the
problem
of
employees
who
did
not
receive
wages,
and
that
is
dealt
with
in
this
statute
explicitly.
and
no
matter
what
any
other
provision
of
state
law
or
the
bankruptcy
code
says,
this
is
the
statute
which
deals
with
that
problem.
the
second
answer
to
the
question
again
is
that
this
does
not
affect
priorities
in
bankruptcy.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
does
not
give
employees
any
claim
in
the
goods,
does
not
give
employees
a
claim
on
the
bankrupt
estate,
does
not
create
liens,
does
not
adjust
citicorp's
property
interest
in
the
goods
themselves
vis
a
vis
anyone
else.
it
simply
provides
a
general
federal
prohibition,
a
universal
prohibition,
on
the
sale
of
tainted
goods.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
an
employee
is
given
a
right
under
section
216.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
quite
right.
this
is
something...
and
i
think
that's
an
important
point,
justice
stevens.
an
action
of
this
sort
under
section
17,
27
u.s.c.
section
217,
is
brought
in
the
public
interest
by
the
secretary.
it
is
not
brought
to
benefit
individual
employees.
it
is
brought
to
combat
generally
the
spread
of
substandard
labor
conditions
and
to
exclude
tainted
goods
from
interstate
commerce...
all
considerations
that
congress
was
very
concerned
about
when
it
passed
the
act.
i
think
the
courts
of
appeals
have
uniformly
held
that
this
should
not
be
viewed
as
an
action
on
behalf
of
the
individual
employee.
this
is
an
action
to
enforce
a
requirement
of
public
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
there
are
a
variety
of
purposes
to
be
served.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that's
quite
true,
justice.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
let
me
take
a
step
backward.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
don't
think
that's
true.
but
again,
let
me
step
back
and
talk
about
all
of
the
purposes
in
context.
first
of
all,
congress
viewed
the
exclusion
of
hot
goods
in
and
of
itself
as
a
goal
of
the
statute
and
as
an
appropriate
result.
when
congress
passed
the
act
in
1938,
it
specifically
endorsed
president
roosevelt's
characterization--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that's
right--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
all
i
can
tell
you,
justice
scalia,
is
congress
endorsed
the
description
of
the
goods
offered
by
president
roosevelt--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--oh,
yes.
there
were
a
considerable
number
of
objectives,
justice
scalia,
and
i
can
tick
them
off
for
you.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that's
quite
right,
justice
rehnquist.
there
were
two
aspects
of
this.
one
is
that
was
the
way
congress
got
at
a
problem
and
accomplished
its
purpose.
another
is
congress
viewed
these
goods
as,
as
then
assistant
attorney
general
jackson
put
it,
the
product
of
ruined
lives
and,
as
president
roosevelt
put
it,
contraband
which
should
not
be
allowed
to
pollute
the
channels
of
interstate
trade.
i
think
congress
did
in
fact
want
to
exclude
these
goods
for
its
own
sake.
but
there
were
also
other
purposes--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
again--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
there
were
a
number
of
purposes
to
be
served.
first
of
all,
the
congress
was
concerned...
citicorp
has
sort
of
raised
the
suggestion
that
congress
was
not
really
concerned
with
problems
of
insolvency
or
employers
who
just
didn't
meet
their
payroll
occasionally.
we
think
that
is
just
plainly
not
true.
congress
applied
the
act
to
every
employer.
congress
wrote
the
act
in
1938
and
it
was
aware
of
problems
of
insolvency
and
marginal
employers.
and
while
it
is
certainly
true
that
an
employer
can
chisel,
in
citicorp's
phrase,
an
employee
by
paying
him
regularly
at
half
the
minimum
rate,
it
can
chisel
him
just
as
effectively
by
skipping
half
of
its
payrolls.
there
is
no
reason
to
think
that
congress
was
unconcerned
with
that
group
of
marginal
employers
who
managed
to
operate
close
to
the
edge
and
stayed
in
business
by
bouncing
payroll
checks
that
they
had
no
real
expectations
of
ever
being
able
to
meet.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
the
clearest
evidence
of
what
congress
had
in
mind,
justice
o'connor,
is
what
it
said,
and
what
it
said
is
every
employer--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
it
does
appear
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
we've
clearly
won
on
the
plain
language,
chief
justice
rehnquist.
i'll
be
happy
to
belabor
the
obvious
and
emphasize
to
the
court
that
there
is
no
question
that
the
plain
terms
of
the
statute
say
exactly...
well,
say
precisely
that
citicorp
cannot
sell
hot
goods
in
interstate
commerce.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
we
think
it
is
clear,
justice
scalia.
we
cited
in
our
brief
on
pages
16
and
17
a
number
of
cases
in
which
employers
were
sued
for
back
pay.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
case,
and
i
believe
there
is
affirmative
indication
in
the
case,
that
the
employers
contracted
to
pay
the
regular
rate,
but
simply
didn't
pay
for
reasons
of
financial
difficulty.
and
when
they
were
sued
for
back
pay,
the
courts
of
appeals
uniformly
held
that
an
employer's
financial
difficulty
is
not
a
defense
in
the
case,
not
a
defense
to
a
suit
under
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
fair
labor
standards
act
provides
a
number
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
that
that's
not
quite
right,
justice
scalia.
the
fair
labor
standards
act
provides
a
number
of
remedies
which
are
in
addition
to
those
available
under
state
contract
law.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
it
provides
liquidated
damages
and
it
allows
the
secretary
to
sue.
and
that
is
an
important
point,
because
congress
was
very
concerned
that
the
act
was
benefiting
employees
who
were
least
able
to
protect
themselves
and
that
they
would
need
the
assistance
of
the
secretary's
enforcement.
and
the
court
emphasized
that
point
in--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i'm
not
aware
of
any
cases
in
which
the
hot
goods
clause--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
generally
speaking
an
employer
must
pay
its
employees
in
the
course
of
business.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
an
employer
can't
operate
on
the
edge.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
am
not
aware
of
any
reported
decisions,
justice
white.
the
secretary
i
know
does
bring
as
a
matter
of
practice
suits
under
both
section
15(a)(1)
and
15(a)(2),
that
combines
the
hot
goods
clause
and
a
direct
suit
against
the
employer
for
violating
the
minimum
wage
and
overtime
requirements.
so
i
think
it
is
a
common
practice
to
bring
such
suits,
and
i
think
it
is
so
clearly
accepted
that
perhaps
it
hasn't
been
discussed
generally
by
the
courts
of
appeals.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
i
think
that's
simply
not
true,
justice
o'connor.
the
secretary
first
dealt
with
this
issue
in
1966,
as
mr.
lee
suggested,
in
the
powell
mills
case,
largely
because,
i
suspect,
the
issue
didn't
arise
very
often
and
still
doesn't
arise
very
often.
we
cite
in
footnote
31
in
our
brief
all
of
the
actions
of
which
we're
aware
in
which
the
secretary
has
tried
to
enforce
the
hot
goods
clause
against
secured
creditor.
there
were
two
in
the
1970's.
there
have
been
a
number
in
the
1980's.
there
was
one
in
1966.
prior
to
1966,
this
issue
simply
wasn't
addressed.
mr.
lee
has
suggested
that
in
1949
the
secretary
took
a
contrary
position.
we
discussed
that
at
length
in
our
brief
at
pages
29
to
31,
and
we
think
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
circular
that
citicorp
relies
upon
that
the
secretary
simply
meant
to
say
that
good
faith
operators...
the
secretary
was
not
dealing
there
at
all
with
secured
creditors,
but
good
faith
operators
generally
could
protect
themselves
only
by
making
certain
that
their
suppliers
had
complied
with
the
act.
the
secretary
said
innocence
was
a
defense
simply
to
criminal
prosecution
under
section
16,
16(a).
and
i
invite
the
court's
examination
of
the
document
that
citicorp
relies
upon.
i
think
it
is
quite
clear
that
our
reading
is
correct.
the
secretary
since
1966
has
consistently
taken
the
position
in
every
case
in
which
this
issue
has
arisen--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i'm
not
sure
that's
true.
citicorp
represents,
and
i
think
it's
probably
right,
that
early
on
inventory
bank
financing
was
relatively
rare.
so
it
may
be
that
there
simply
were
not
that
many
factual
situations
like
this.
and
i
should
add
that
even
since
1966
there
have
been
relatively
few
cases.
in
order
to
prosecute
an
action
of
this
sort,
the
secretary
has
to
find
the
violation
and
obtain
an
injunction
relatively
quickly,
and
he
has
to
do
it
in
the
circumstance
in
which
he
thinks
it's
appropriate.
so
it
may
be
that
there
simply
are
not
that
many
instances
in
which
this
issue
arises.
i
should
return,
while
on
that
point,
to
the
question
of
the
act,
but
before
i
do
that
i
want
to
deal
more
directly
with
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
citicorp's
entire
argument,
i
think
as
the
court
generally
has
noted,
is
devoted
to
running
away
from
what
congress
actually
said
in
section
15.
its
entire
argument
is
based
on
cases
like
holy
trinity,
which
relies
upon
the
proposition
that
congress
here
simply
didn't
know
what
it
was
doing
when
it
wrote
section
15(a)(1).
whatever
the
propriety
of
departing
from
the
statutory
language
in
a
situation
like
that,
where
congress
specifically
intended
an
outcome
in
a
given
case,
obviously
a
claim
that
congress
didn't
know
what
it
was
doing
is
one
that
should
be
treated
with
great
skepticism.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
i
cannot
make
that
commitment
for
all
time,
justice
scalia.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
but
i
can
certainly
say
that
we
think
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
is
the
clearest
indication
of
how
the
statute
should
be
applied.
and
if
one
even
deals
with
citicorp
on
its
own
ground
and
says,
did
congress
mean
what
it
was
saying
when
it
wrote
section
15(a)(1),
i
think
there
is
no
question
that
congress
meant
precisely
what
it
said.
citicorp
never
exactly
says
precisely
what
the
term
"person"
should
mean
if
it
doesn't
mean
what
it
is
defined
to
mean
in
the
statute.
but
it
sort
of
hints
in
its
brief
that
it
means
perhaps
dealers
and
subcontractors
or
culpable
parties.
if
congress
had
wanted
to
write
those
restrictions
into
the
statute,
it
knew
how
to
do
that.
it
wrote
precisely
those
restrictions
into
other
provisions
of
the
fair
labor
standards
act.
dealers
and
manufacturers
are
dealt
with
by
the
child
labor
prohibitions
of
section
12.
willful
violators
are
dealt
with
in
the
criminal
penalty
provisions
of
section
16.
other
provisions
of
the
act
deal
only
with
employers.
but
section
15(a)(1),
alone
among
the
substantive
prohibitions
of
the
act,
deals
with
"any
person".
that
could
not
have
been
inadvertent.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
this,
section
15(a)(1)
contains
two
explicit
exemptions,
one
for
common
carriers,
which
was
added
only
because
congress
didn't
want
a
test
of
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute
to
arise
in
a
case
involving
a
carrier's
obligation
to
transport
goods;
the
other
for
certain
good
faith
purchasers
which
was
added
in
1949.
that
exemption
is
worth
looking
at
closely,
because
it
is
unusually
strict.
it
is
not
enough
that
a
purchaser
acquire
goods
for
value
and
in
good
faith.
to
benefit
from
that
exemption,
he
also
must
acquire
goods
in
reliance
on
the
producer's
written
statement
of
compliance
with
the
act.
now,
if
congress
felt
it
necessary
to
write
special
exemptions
of
that
sort
into
section
15
to
benefit
two
discrete
and
demonstrably
innocent
categories
of
people,
it
certainly
thought
that
the
act
otherwise
would
reach
everyone,
no
matter
how
innocent
or
uninvolved.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
probably,
justice
white.
the
term
3,
i
believe
it's
section
3(j),
to
include
goods
that
were
handled
by
employees
who...
both
production
and
handling.
so
if
the
goods
were
handled
by
employees
who
hadn't
been
paid,
those
goods
could
not
be
shipped
either.
if
the
goods
had
entirely
been
treated
by
employees
who
were
paid
in
compliance
with
the
act,
they
could
of
course
be
shipped.
there
would
be
no
statutory
prohibition.
our
point
is
that
the
plain
language
of
the
statute
applies
in
a
case
like
this
one,
where
there
was
the
statutory
obligation
to
pay
and
no
pay
was
made,
and
where
the
person
as
defined
in
the
statute,
and
citicorp
undoubtedly
is
a
person
as
defined
in
the
statute,
is
trying
to
introduce
those
goods
into
interstate
commerce.
section
15
says
on
its
face
that
citicorp
shouldn't
be
able
to
do
that.
applying
the
statute
here
accomplishes
precisely
what
congress
set
out
to
accomplish
when
it
wrote
section
15,
because
congress
intended
to
make
sure
that
everyone...
well,
congress
intended
to
apply
section
15
to
everyone,
so
that
no
one
would
be
able
to
deal
in
hot
goods,
so
that
everyone
would
be
aware
to
watch
out
for
hot
goods,
everyone
would
be
aware
that
they
could
not
benefit
from
an
employer's
failure
to
pay
minimum
wage.
that
is
part
of
the
entire
enforcement
scheme
of
the
act.
citicorp's
argument
to
the
contrary
simply
ignores
the
theory
on
which
the
fair
labor
standards
act
operates.
i
should
add
one
additional
thing
about
this
insolvency
and
bankruptcy
point,
which
we
think
is
a
red
herring
thrown
into
the
case
by
citicorp
to
distract
the
court
from
the
plain
language
of
the
statute.
as
i
was
suggesting
before,
the
act
essentially
creates
a
universal
prohibition
on
anyone's
ability
to
deal
with
certain
types
of
goods.
it
does
not
create
property
interests
in
those
goods,
it
does
not
create
liens.
it
simply
says
no
one
can
deal
with
those
goods
until
they
have
been
cured
in
the
meaning
of
the
statute
or
until
the
secretary
determines
not
to
bring
an
enforcement
action.
nothing
in
that
addresses
insolvency.
nothing
in
that
type
of
enactment
addresses
priorities
in
bankruptcy.
it
simply,
as
i
say,
creates
a
universal
prohibition
as
a
matter
of
public
policy,
a
familiar
type
of
prohibition
that
congress
created
many
times.
there
is
no
doubt
that
if,
for
example,
any
of
these
goods
had
been
flammable
rather
than
hot,
they
could
not
have
been
introduced
into
interstate
commerce.
and
we
think
precisely
the
same
principle
is
at
stake
in
this
case.
we
urge
the
court
to
apply
the
statute
as
it
was
written,
to
accomplish
the
purposes
congress
tried
to
accomplish.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
