mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
basic
issues
in
this
case
involve
fairly
narrow
questions
of
statutory
construction.
they
have
considerable
significance
for
the
banking
industry.
the
question
on
the
merits
is
whether
discount
brokerage
offices
that
are
operated
by
national
banks
must
be
treated
as
regular
bank
branches
that
are
subject
to
the
geographical
restrictions
on
branching
imposed
by
the
mcfadden
act.
the
other
closely
related
issue
here
is
whether
respondent
has
standing
to
try
to
enforce
those
geographical
limitations.
the
background
that
gives
rise
to
these
issues
is,
simply
stated,
in
1982
two
national
banks
applied
to
the
comptroller
of
the
currency
for
permission
to
operate
discount
brokerage
offices
interstate.
the
comptroller
granted
the
applications
after
concluding
in
a
comprehensive
written
opinion
that
bank
offices
offering
only
discount
brokerage
services
are
not
branches
within
the
meaning
of
the
mcfadden
act,
and
therefore
naturally
are
not
affected
by
that
act's
prohibition
on
interstate
branching
by
national
banks.
the
case
is
here
because
first
the
district
court
and
then
a
divided
panel
of
the
court
of
appeals
disagreed
with
the
comptroller's
reading
of
the
statute.
in
a
suit
brought
by
the
respondent,
a
trade
association
representing
underwriters
and
securities
brokers,
those
courts
correctly
found
that
the
mcfadden
act
in
12
usc
section
36c
permits
a
national
bank
to
operate
a
branch
only
in
its
home
state,
and
even
there
only
to
the
extent
that
state
banks
are
permitted
to
branch
by
state
law.
but
the
courts
went
on
to
hold
incorrectly,
in
our
view,
that
essentially
all
bank
offices
must
be
treated
as
branches
within
the
meaning
of
the
act.
as
a
result
the
courts
held
that
banks
may
offer
discount
brokerage
services
only
at
licensed
in-state
branches.
and
in
the
course
of
reaching
this
conclusion
those
courts
obviously
held
that
respondent
has
standing
to
challenge
the
location
of
bank
discount
brokerage
offices.
in
our
view,
both
of
these
holdings
on
standing
and
on
the
merits
turned
on
a
fundamental
misapplication
of
the
mcfadden
act
and
its
meaning.
on
the
substantive
branch
in
question
the
lower
courts
disregarded
both
the
plain
language
of
the
mcfadden
act
and
the
comptroller's
comprehensive
analysis
of
what
the
statute
means,
and
the
courts
granted
standing
to
a
party
that
congress
plainly
did
not
intend
to
be
one
of
the
beneficiaries
of
the
mcfadden
act's
restrictions.
because
these
issues
are
related,
because
some
background
on
the
operation
of
the
mcfadden
act
may
shed
light
on
standing
issue,
i
would
like
to
reverse
the
usual
order
and
talk
about
the
merits
of
the
case
first
before
reaching,
discussing
the
standing
question.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
much
as
we
would
like
you
to
resolve
the
banking
question,
i
think
if
the
parties
were
found
not
to
have
standing,
that
should
be
the
end
of
the
case.
on
the
substantive
banking
question,
we
think
that
the
resolution
is
straightforward,
and
that,
i
think,
lends
itself
to
a
discussion
of
the
act.
that
is
why
i
am
talking
about
it
first.
the
district
court
here
recognized
that
the
geographical
restrictions
imposed
on
bank
branches
by
section
36c
apply
only
to
bank
offices
that
are
in
fact
branches
within
the
meaning
of
the
mcfadden
act.
other
bank
offices
may
be
operated
anywhere
not
subject
to
locational
restraints.
that
means
that
this
case
can
be
resolved
simply
by
deciding
whether
bank-owned
securities
brokerage
offices
are
branches
within
the
meaning
of
the
mcfadden
act.
as
might
be
expected,
the
act
itself
contains
a
precise
definitional
provision
that
answers
this
question.
12
usc
section
36f
defines
the
term
"branch"
to
include
any
branch
bank,
branch
office,
branch
agency,
additional
office,
or
branch
place
of
business
at
which
deposits
received,
checks
paid,
or
money
lent.
this
provision
states
on
its
face
that
a
bank
office
is
a
branch
within
the
meaning
of
the
act
only
if
it
does
one
of
those
three
things,
if
it
takes
deposits,
pays
checks,
or
makes
loans.
bank
discount
brokerage
offices,
whether
or
not
owned
by
national
banks,
do
none
of
those
things,
and
that
necessarily
means
that
they
are
not
branches
within
the
meaning
of
the
act,
are
not
subject
to
the
act's
geographical
restrictions,
and
that
should
be
the
end
of
this
case.
that
is
all
that
is
necessary
to
resolve
the
merits.
if
there
is
any
doubt
about
this,
the
legislative
history
makes
it
quite
clear
congress
meant
what
it
said
in
section
36f,
in
defining
where
the
geographical
limits
apply.
during
debate
on
the
mcfadden
act,
congress
made
clear
and
stated
repeatedly
that
the
act
and
its
geographical
restrictions
were
designed
to
provide
for
competitive
equality
between
state
and
national
banks
in
the
provision
of
the
basic
banking
services
listed
in
section
36(f).
as
a
result,
it
is
not
surprising
that
all
of
the
discussion
in
congress
about
the
appropriate
scope
of
branching
restrictions
mentioned
only
bank
offices
that
did
one
of
those
three
things,
that
took
deposits,
paid
checks,
or
made
loans.
in
contrast,
during
the
entire
three
years
that
the
mcfadden
act
was
under
consideration,
there
was
no
suggestion
made
by
anyone
that
geographical
restraints
had
been
or
would
be
imposed
on
any
other
bank
officers
performing
any
other
activities.
and
this
was
a
significant
omission
by
the
drafters
of
the
mcfadden
act.
from
the
time
of
the
enactment
of
the
national
bank
act
in
1864,
national
banks
performed
incidental
services
away
from
their
main
offices.
as
long
ago
as
1870
this
court
upheld
their
authority
to
do
that
in
the
merchants
bank
decision,
and
in
the
years
following
merchants
bank
national
banks
developed
a
substantial
volume
of
that
business,
including
particularly,
as
we
demonstrate
in
our
brief,
a
very
substantial
interstate
securities
business.
now,
in
1927,
when
congress
passed
the
mcfadden
act,
it
was
well
aware
of
all
this
interstate
bank
activity.
it
made
reference
to
it
and
specifically
authorized
banks
to
continue
the
securities
business.
had
congress
wanted
to
confine
those
bank
operations
to
in-state
branches
in
the
process
overruling
merchants
bank
and
substantially
curtailing
the
existing
business
of
national
banks
it
presumably
would
have
said
something
about
that,
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
language
or
legislative
history
of
the
mcfadden
act
suggesting
that
congress
had
any
such
intention
when
it
passed
the
statute.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
you
are
referring,
justice
white,
to
section
36's
companion
provision,
12
usc
section
81--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--which
respondent
has
pointed
to
for
that.
and
i
think
there
are
a
number
of
difficulties
with
respondent's
reading
of
that
provision.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
yes,
it
was,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
the
district
court,
we
think
engaged
in
the
proper
form
of
analysis.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
correct.
the
district
court
looked,
as
we
suggest
this
court
should
look,
to
section
36(f)
in
determining
whether
or
not
the
bank
office
involved
was
defined
as
a
branch
within
those
terms,
although
respondent's
argument
was
presented
to
the
lower
court.
well,
didn't
our
plant
city
opinion
say
that
a
branch
office
might
be
a
branch
even
though
it
doesn't
perform
one
of
the
three
functions
that
you
have
described?
plant
city
expressly
declined
to
decide
whether
a
bank
office
that
does
not
perform
one
of
those
functions
every
could
be
treated
as
a
branch.
most
of
the
plant
city
opinion
then
went
on
to
decide
whether
the
bank
facilities
at
issue
in
plant
city
did
one
of
those
three
things,
and
the
court
ultimately
concluded
they
took
deposits
and
for
that
reason
were
branches.
that
is
exactly
the
analysis
we
are
asking
the
court--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--i
think
as
far
as
it
went
was
to
state
that
a
bank's
branch
includes
offices
that
perform
those
three
functions
and
may
include
more.
the
court
found
it
unnecessary
to
decide
whether
it
did
include
more,
because
the
facilities
there
took
deposits.
but
this
court
has
never
suggested
that
beyond
that
that
ambiguous
statement
leaving
the
question
open
that
a
bank
office
should
be
treated
as
a
branch
if
it
doesn't
do
one
of
those
three
things.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
that
is
our
position.
that
issue
has
been
litigated,
and
the
eighth
circuit
has
held
that
trust
businesses
are
within
the
definition
of
branch.
so
far
as
we
are
aware,
that
is
the
only
decision
by
any
court
that
has
ever
suggested
that
a
bank
office
does
not
perform
one
of
those
three
functions
should
be
treated
as
a
branch
within
the
meaning
of
the
statute.
we
think
that
that
decision
is
incorrect.
in
fact,
there
are
literally
hundreds
of
bank
offices
that
have
been
authorized
by
the
comptroller
operating
nationwide
now
that
so
long
as
they
do
not
perform
under
those
three
functions
are
not
treated
by
the
comptroller
as
branches.
one
of
the
difficulties
with
both
respondent's
broad
reading
of
section
81
and
the
district
court's
parallel
analysis
here
which
essentially
reads
the
mcfadden
act
to
mean
that
anything
that
a
bank
can
do
at
its
main
office
it
must
do
only
at
the
main
office
or
at
a
licensed
branch,
which
essentially
realistically
means
that
all
bank
operations
must
be
performed
at
one
of
those
two
locations.
really
it
is
entirely
without
support
either
in
decisions
of
the
courts
or
the
interpretation
of
the
comptroller,
who
is
entrusted
with
administering
the
statute.
in
all
the
time
that
the
mcfadden
act
has
been
on
the
books,
in
60
years
no
court
has
given
it
as
broad
a
reading
as
the
lower
courts
gave
it
here.
even
that
eighth
circuit
case
concerned
a
banking
type
function,
and
aside
from
that
case
every
decision
to
confront
a
mcfadden
act
challenge
as
well
as
every
ruling
of
the
comptroller
to
address
the
issue
has
ultimately
looked
to
whether
the
bank
office
performed
one
of
the
three
functions
enumerated
in
section
36(f).
the
sort
of
analysis
proposed
by
the
respondent
and
used
by
the
district
court
here
would
sweep
away
all
of
that
administrative
and
judicial
construction
of
the
statute,
and
it
would
sweep
away
as
well
all
of
the
interstate
business
conducted
by
national
banks
at
offices
that
don't
perform
one
of
those
three
functions.
all
that
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
reading
proposed
by
the
courts
below.
in
fact,
i
think
what
the
court...
what
congress
meant
in
section
81,
the
statute
that
respondent
is
pointing
to
and
that
justice
white
has
asked
about,
was
a
general
banking
business,
a
business
that
performs
essential
banking
functions
and
offers
essential
banking
services.
in
the
mcfadden
act
itself
congress
pointed
out
what
those
services
are,
taking
deposits,
making
loans,
and
cashing
checks.
if
a
bank
office
is
not
doing
at
least
one
of
those
things
it
is
not
offering
a
general
banking
business.
i
think
that
is
all
really
that
is
needed
to
decide
the
merits
in
this
case.
i
think
before
sitting
down
i
should
say
a
word
about
the
standing
issue
here
also,
which
requires
a
look
at
a
different
portion
of
the
legislative
history
of
the
mcfadden
act.
that
history
and
this
court's
consistent
interpretations
of
it
put
it
beyond
dispute
that
when
congress
enacted
the
act
it
had
one
goal
in
mind
and
only
one
goal.
it
wanted
to
equalize
competition
between
state
and
national
banks
in
the
provision
of
the
basic
banking
services
that
are
listed
in
section
36(f)
to
prevent
either
group
of
banks
from
getting
an
advantage
over
the
other.
respondent,
which
competes
with
both
national
and
state
banks,
obviously
doesn't
fall
into
either
group,
and
by
definition
that
means
that
respondent
cannot
satisfy
what
the
court
has
called
the
zone
of
interest
prerequisite
standard.
as
the
court
explained
last
term
in
its
pierce
county
decision,
and
as
the
lower
courts
have
uniformly
held,
plaintiff
satisfies
that
prerequisite
only
if
it
is
able
to
show
that
congress
intended
it
to
benefit
from
the
statute
that
is
at
issue
in
the
litigation.
as
professor
jaffe
asked
rhetorically
in
describing
the
values
that
are
served
by
the
zone
of
interest
requirement,
if
the
people
that
the
law
chooses
to
protect
are
satisfied
with
the
status
quo,
although
it
may
involve
an
alleged
violation
of
the
law,
why
should
a
stranger
have
a
right
to
insist
on
enforcement?
respondent
is
just
such
a
stranger
or
incidental
beneficiary
of
the
restrictions
that
are
imposed
by
the
mcfadden
act.
this
is
not
a
situation
where
there
is
any
doubt
about
whom
congress
intended
to
benefit
from
the
act
or
the
statute
was
silent
about
the
beneficiaries.
here
it
is
quite
clear
congress
intended
to
provide
for
competitive
equality
between
state
and
national
banks
so
that
neither
bank,
neither
group
would
get
an
advantage
over
the
other.
given
this,
we
think
that
then
judge
scalia
had
it
absolutely
right
in
his
dissent
in
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
where
he
noted
that
the
brokerage
houses
suing
here
are
no
more
within
the
zone
of
interest
of
the
mcfadden
act
than
would
be
a
business
competing
for
parking
spaces
with
an
unlawfully
licensed
branch.
we
think
that
such
an
incidental,
unintended
beneficiary
of
the
mcfadden
act's
restrictions,
particularly
one
who
is
trying
to
sue
under
a
statute
that
was
designed
to
preserve
competition
should
not
be
able
to
go
into
court
to
win
itself
windfall
relief
from
competition.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i
will
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
two
basic
points
on
the
merits
and
one
on
standing,
your
honor.
if
section
81
is
the
fundamental
restriction
on
the
activities
of
national
banks
that
has
been
presented
to
you,
it
is
remarkable
that
in
the
60
years
the
mcfadden
act
has
been
on
the
books
neither
the
courts
nor
the
comptroller
have
noticed
that.
as
i
suggested
before,
all--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
the
discussion
of
section
81
in
this
case
was
largely
in
response
to
the
comptroller's
argument,
which
was
not
repeated
here,
that
the
mcfadden
act
only
reaches
intrastate
and
not
extra-state
activities
of
national
banks.
i
think
a
fair
reading
of
what
the
district
court...
district
court's
analysis
which
looked
to
representative
mcfadden's
statement
in
plant
city
is
that
it
turned
largely
on
the
meaning
of
section
36,
aside
from
the
references
in
this,
which--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
did
say
that
in
response,
as
i
said,
to
the
argument
of
the
comptroller.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
well,
leaving
aside
the
district
court's
opinion
here,
which
i
think
the
preceding
discussion
in
the
district
court's
opinion--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
i
think
in
looking
at
it--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
our
reading
of--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
again,
our
reading
of
the
district
court's
opinion
is
that
it
focused
on
a
different
analysis.
but
aside
from
this
case,
in
any
event,
no
court
and
the
comptroller
have
never
pointed
to
section
81
in
deciding
whether
bank
offices
are
subject
to
geographical
restrictions.
and
i
think
there
is
a
simple
explanation
for
that.
i
think
that
the
account
that
has
been
presented
here
simply
turns
the
history
of
the
mcfadden
act
on
its
head.
from
the...
section
81
was
part
of
the
original
national
bank
act
of
1864,
and
at
the
time
it
referred
to
the
usual
business
of
the
national
bank.
the
terms
1927
when
the
current
language
was
placed
in
the
statute,
used
interchangeably
in
court
opinions
and
in
the
opinion
of
the
attorney
general
that
this
court
has
called
authoritative.
i
can't
see
that
there
was
any
distinction
between
the
two.
an
from
the
beginning
it
has
been
recognized
that
national
banks
can
perform
business,
certain
types
of
business,
away
from
their
main
offices.
this
court
recognized
that
immediately
after
the
passage
of
the
national
bank
act
in
1870
in
the
merchants
bank
case.
and
in
fact
the
language
of
the
statute
refers
not
to
the
business
of
a
bank
or
all
the
business
but
to
the
general
business.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
that's
right,
justice
white,
we
think
the
general
business...
well,
our
analysis
is
broader
than
that,
although
we
think
that
is
all
the
court
need
say
here.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
essentially
that's
right.
before
the
passage
of
the
mcfadden
act
the
only
restriction
that
section
81
was
seen
to
place
on
national
banks
essentially
was
the
ability
to...
it
restricted
their
ability
to
branch.
the
attorney
general
analyzed
the
statute
in
1911
in
an
opinion
this
court
termed
authoritative,
and
he
saw
the
distinction
as
being
between
a
branch
bank
which
performed
the
full
range
of
essential
banking
functions
and
particular
bank
officers
that
performed
individual
bank
functions
but
did
not
offer
a
general
banking
business.
that
was
the
interpretation
placed
on
section
81.
when
congress
passed
the
mcfadden
act
of
1927,
it
liberalized
that
by
essentially
removing
a
portion
of
the
one
restriction
that
was
placed
on
locational
activities
of
national
banks,
by
permitting
banks
to
branch,
although
subject
to
section
36
of
those
geographical
restrictions.
when
it
did
that
it
specifically
reenacted
section
81
as
a
part
of
the
mcfadden
act
and
amended
section
81
to
refer
to
the
branching
restrictions
imposed
by
section
36.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
not
at
all,
justice
white.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
no,
they
could
not
do
that.
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
the
powers
granted
national
banks
are
specifically
set
out
in
12
usc
section
24
7th,
and--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
congress
has
set
out
essentially
two
types
of
businesses
that
banks
engage
in,
the
business
of
banking,
and
it
lists
a
series
of
things
that
banks
can
engage
in
as
part
of
the
business
of
banking.
it
separately
authorizes
banks
to
engage
in
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
securities,
which
is
what
obviously
the
national
banks
are
trying
to
do
in
this
case.
and
congress
has
also
authorized
banks
to
engage
in--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--it
is
not
part
of
their
general
banking
business
as
that
term--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--well,
the
statute
refers
to
the
general
business
of
a
national
bank,
and
that
statutory
language
was
interpreted
by
this
court,
by
the
comptroller,
and
by
the
attorney
general,
and
again
in
an
opinion
that
was
endorsed
by
this
court
prior
to
1927
as
meaning
a
general
banking
business.
the
terms
were
used
interchangeably.
that
was
the
interpretation
placed
on
the
statute
from
its
enactment,
and
congress--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--as
part
of
their
business,
but
again,
section
81--
mr.
charles
a.
rothfeld
--section
81
doesn't
refer
to
all
business
or
the
business.
it
refers
to
the
general
business,
and
as
i
say,
since
1870
the
court
has
taken
the
position
that
the
general
business
is
a
subset
of
all
the
business
the
bank
is
authorized
to
engage
in,
the
subset
being
the
general
banking
business,
the
essential
functions
related
to
the
banking
activities
of
the
bank,
and
when
congress
reenacted
section
81
as
part
of
the
mcfadden
act
it
included
an
express
reference
to
section
36,
suggesting,
i
think,
irrefutably
that
what
congress
has
in
mind
is
the
essential
banking
functions.
those
that
could
only
be
performed
at
the
main
office
or
a
branch
are
the
functions
listed
in
section
36(f).
it
may
be
that
the
respondent's
reluctance
to
talk
about
section
36
stems
from
the
fact
that
his
reading
of
section
81...
would
read
section
36
out
of
the
statute
entirely,
because
if
all
the
bank's
business
must
be
performed
only
at
its
branches
or
at
its
main
office,
there
is
no
point
in
separately
defining
the
term
"branch"
in
terms
of
a
limited
number
of
specifically
enumerated
functions.
thank
you,
your
honors.
