mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
good
afternoon,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
respondent
stockbrokers
seek
to
exclude
national
banks
from
their
national,
nationwide
market,
not
through
fair
competition
beneficial
to
consumers
but
through
selective,
novel,
and
unfair
reading
of
statutory
language.
three
points
strongly
support
the
solicitor
general's
position
that
neither
section
36
nor
section
81
can
rationally
be
interpreted
to
render
unreasonable
the
comptroller's
ruling
that
a
national
bank
may
provide
discount
brokerage
security
services
on
a
nationwide
basis.
first,
the
legislative
history
of
the
mcfadden
act
section
2(b)
regarding
national
bank
authority
to
conduct
a
safe
deposit
business.
second,
the
consistency
of
the
comptroller's
ruling
over
70
years
of
practice
and
congressional
approval
of
such
practice.
and
third,
the
inconsistency
of
respondent's
position
with
this
court's
efforts
to
analyze
section
36
in
the
plant
city
national
bank
case.
i
would
first
like
to
turn
to
section
2(b)
of
the
mcfadden
act.
in
the
same
section
which
affirmed
the
national
bank
authority
to
engage
in
the
security
brokerage
business
also
affirmed
the
authority
to
conduct
a
safe
deposit
business.
the
provisions
in
section
2(b)
of
the
bill
dealing
with
the
safe
deposit
business
originally
provided
that
such
business
could
only
be
conducted
at
the
principal
office
of
its
branches
or
in
a
building
adjacent
thereto.
the
location
restrictions,
however,
were
deleted
during
floor
debates.
representative
seller
asked,
"does
this
mean
that
a
safe
deposit
business
can
be
conducted
a
block
away
or
a
mile
away
from
the
national
bank
association?
"
representative
mcfadden
responded
that
the
amendment
removes
limitations
on
locations.
this
fact
completely
destroys
respondent's
argument
that
anything
which
is
authorized
by
section
24
7th
must
be
done
only
at
the
principal
office
or
at
a
branch,
because
clearly
here
there
is
congressional
intent
to
show
that
something
which
is
authorized
by
24
7th
nevertheless
could
be
done
other
than
at
the
branch
or
at
the
home
office.
with
respect
to
the
discount
brokerage
business
congress
never
at
the
time
when
it
inserted
the
authority
to
do
the
security
discount
brokerage
business,
never
at
any
time
talked
about
a
limitation,
and
as
you
know,
a
distinguished
member
of
this
court
once
said
that
"a
page
of
history
is
worth
a
book
of
logic.
"
and
we
have
detailed
throughout
our
briefs
on
page
22
to
27
of
the
reply
brief,
all
the
instances
where
since
the
first
bank
act
was
established
in
1864
where
banks
have
done
things
other
than
the
core
business,
which
is
defined
in
section
36,
at
places
throughout
the
united
states.
third,
with
respect
to
the
plant
city
national
bank
case,
mr.
chief
justice,
the
issue
there
was
whether
the
activity
being
done
was
one
of
the
three
things
defined
in
that
section
36.
if
the
court
had
felt
that
section
81,
which
says
the
general
business
of
the
bank
can't
be
done
any
place
other
than
the
principal
office
or
branches,
then
there
was
no
need
to
spend
about
15
pages
trying
to
determine
whether
what
was
being
done
was
the
receipt
of
deposits.
and
there
is
nothing
in
that
case
which
in
any
way
indicates
that
when
the...
chief
justice
burger
is
talking
about
it
may
be
more,
that
he
is
not
talking
about
additional
places
rather
than
additional
activities.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
and
then
that
takes
you
back
to
the
statute,
and
here
the
judge
below
said,
based
upon
the
literal
reading
of
the
statute,
that
the
comptroller
was
correct.
it
is
also
in
the
plant
city
case
they
talk
about
this
indefiniteness.
now,
under
those
circumstances
it
seems
to
me
that
it
is
clear
that
this
court
should
say
that
since
the
comptroller
is
the
one
responsible
for
administering
the
statute,
and
if
you
have
this
clear...
if
you
have
indefiniteness,
a
vagueness,
then
that
is
the
type
of
case
where
you
have
always
said
that
you
will
affirm
the
comptroller
and
he
does
give
reason.
now,
with
respect
to
the
statute,
the
sole
reason
why
the
judge
below
said
that
the
statute
which
in
my
judgment
reads
so
clearly
nevertheless
doesn't
give
the
result
we
say
is
because
as
a
statement
by
mr.
mcfadden
made
ten
days
after
congress
has
passed
the
statute
and
also
after
presumably
the
president
has
signed
the
law,
and
that
statute
in
which
he
says
not
only
is
it
the
three
things
in
86(f)
but
in
addition
it
is
anything
you
could
do
at
your
principal
place
of
business.
there
is
not
a
word
about
that
in
the
statute.
there
is
not
a
word
in
any
of
the
legislative
history
of
that.
the
one
thing,
and
you
know,
whenever
you
talk
about
statutory
interpretation,
congressional
intent,
you
know,
some
time
it
works,
sometimes
it
doesn't,
but
the
one
thing
which
i
think
this
court
has
finally
established
and
has
to
establish
is
that
statements
made
by
a
senator
or
congressman
after
the
bill
was
passed
and
after
it
was
voted
upon
has
no
significance
whatsoever
in
determining
the
interpretation
of
the
statute,
and
once
you
get
away
from
that,
then
i
assure
you
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
legislative
history,
there
is
not
a
word
in
the
statute
which
justifies
saying
that
anything
other
than
the
activity
set
forth
in
section
36(f)
are
those
activities
that
are
restricted
to
the
principal
office
and
the
branches.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
the
answer
is,
your
honor,
no.
i
will
explain
to
you,
because
i
asked
the
same
thing.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
it
took
me
a
long
time...
i
will
tell
you
what
the
answer
is.
the
comptroller
has
to
authorize
the
setting
up
of
any
subsidiary
corporation
of
a
national
bank
regardless
of
what
that
subsidiary
is
going
to
do,
and
on
that
basis
he
authorized
this
transaction.
but
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
which
says
that
he
specifically
has
to
authorize
the
setting
up
as
it
was
in
the
case
that
mr.
justice
powell
had
when
you
were
dealing
with
the
holding
company
acquiring
a
discount
security
brokerage
business,
and
there,
because
the
holding
company
act
says
you
can
only
do
banking
and
things
which
are
closely
related
and
you
there
interpreted
section
4(c)(8)
as
saying
the
business
is
closely
related
and
therefore
that
got
the
approval.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
that's
true.
mr.
william
t.
coleman,
jr.
yes,
sir.
yes,
sir,
that's
correct.
i
have
no
other
remarks,
unless
there
are
other
questions.
