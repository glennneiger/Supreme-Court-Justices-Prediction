chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
85-971,
robert
l.
clarke,
comptroller
of
the
currency,
versus
securities
industry
association,
and
security
pacific
national
bank
versus
securities
industry
association.
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready,
mr.
rothfeld.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
isn't
there
language
in
plant
city
suggesting
that
you
could
have
a
branch
even
though
it
doesn't
do
one
of
those
three
things?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
we
will
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
coleman.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
of
course
there
is
nothing
to
indicate
to
the
contrary,
either.
the
language
could
well
mean
that
it
includes
these
three
things
but
it
might
include
something
else.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
coleman.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
weidner.
chief
justice
rehnquist
do
you
think
general
business
then
doesn't
mean
anything
more
than
just
business,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
rehnquist
any
indication
in
the
legislative
history
as
to
why
that
change
was
made?
chief
justice
rehnquist
of
course,
you
read
81
as
a
limitation.
you
read
it
as
if
it
said
the
general
business
of
each
national
banking
association
shall
be
transacted
only
in
the
place
specified
in
its
organization
certificate
and
the
branch
or
branches.
it
doesn't
say
that.
a
statute
that
said
a
bank
shall
be
open
for
business
every
day
from
9:00
a.m.
to
3:00
p.m.
monday
through
friday
would
not
necessarily
be
read
to
prohibit
a
bank
from
being
open
on
saturday.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
weidner.
mr.
rothfeld,
do
you
have
something
more?
you
have
six
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
rothfeld.
the
case
is
submitted.
