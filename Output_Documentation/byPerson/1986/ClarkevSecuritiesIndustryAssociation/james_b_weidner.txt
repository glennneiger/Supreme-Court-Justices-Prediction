mr.
james
b.
weidner
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case,
of
course,
concerns
the
locational
restrictions
of
the
national
bank
act.
the
act's
basic
restriction
in
that
respect
is
section
81.
that
statute
enacted
over
100
years
ago
provided
that
a
national
bank
was
limited
in
transacting
its
business
to
one
office.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
it
is,
as
enacted,
and
i
will
return
to
this,
it
was
its
usual
business.
as
amended
in
1927
and
now
it
is
general
business.
it
did
not
say
its
banking
business.
in
fact,
that
is
a
significant
factor
to
which--
mr.
james
b.
weidner
--correct,
justice
white.
indeed,
the
only
exception
that
congress
has
made
to
that
one
office
restriction
was
in
the
mcfadden
act
in
1927.
that
act
as
amended
permits
national
banks
to
establish
branches
within
the
state
where
their
main
office
is
located
to
the
extent
permitted
by
state
law.
in
effect,
the
comptroller's
ruling
focused
solely
on
the
branching
exception
and
ignored
completely
the
basic
locational
rule.
furthermore,
it
seemed
to
assume
that
national
banks
were
permitted
to
establish
multiple
locations
to
carry
on
their
business
unless
they
were
expressly
prohibited
from
doing
so.
in
fact,
banking
law
is
just
the
reverse.
that
logical
lapse,
we
suggest,
pervades
the
comptroller's
argument
here
both
as
to
substance--
mr.
james
b.
weidner
--in
our
argument
below,
justice
white,
there
was
some
suggestion
in
the
briefs
in
response
to
ours
that
the
section
81
argument
hadn't
been
made.
in
fact,
it
was
made.
the
district
court's
opinion
starts
with
a
quotation
to
section
81,
and
indeed,
and
if
i
may,
reading
from
the
appendix
which
is
part
of
the
petition,
25a,
the
district
court
rejected
the
comptroller's
argument
as
to
interstate
locations
because
"it
ignores
completely
the
fact
that
the
mcfadden
act
was
a
limited
extension
of
the
national
banking
act
provisions
for
the
location
of
bank
offices
which
previously
had
allowed
national
banks
only
one
central
office.
"
"never
have
national
banks
been
authorized
under
the
national
bank
act
to--
"
mr.
james
b.
weidner
--they
affirmed
basically
for
the
reasons...
the
decision
below,
justice
white.
there
was
no
separate
opinion.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
it
was,
to
the
extent...
in
this
sense.
the
comptroller's
argument
is
essentially
that
section
36
does
not
restrict
these
activities.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
therefore
they
are
permissible
countrywide.
in
our
view
that
is
not
so.
in
our
view
if
they
are
not
permitted
by
section
36,
they
remain
subject
to
81
and
therefore
are
restricted
to
the
home
office.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
i
think
it
was
the
implicit
rationale,
justice
white.
in
any
event
i
believe
it
is
the
correct
rationale,
and,
i
believe,
quite
consistent
with
the
district
court's
opinion.
section
81
is
the
basic
provision
here
and
has
been
in
the
case
since
the
beginning,
and
we
believe
this
is
a
plain
language
case
except
that
the
governing
plain
language,
we
believe,
is
that
of
section
81.
that
provision,
and
i
will
quote,
states
that
the
general
business
of
each
national
banking
association
shall
be
transacted
at
the
place
specified
in
its
organization
certificate
and
in
the
branch
or
branches,
if
any,
established
or
maintained
by
it
in
accordance
with
the
provisions
of
section
36
of
its
title.
the
statute
does
not
further
define
the
terms
used
in
section
81
thereby
leading
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
intended
the
ordinary
meaning.
the
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
"general"
is
all
encompassing
or
including
the
whole
rather
than
a
part
of
a
particular
thing.
here,
then,
under
the
plain
language
reading
of
this
provision
the
conclusion
follows
that
congress
intended
to
cover
the
whole
of
the
general
business
of
a
national
bank.
but
in
this
case
it
is
not
necessary
to
try
to
define
the
outer
parameters
of
that
since
at
a
minimum
it
certainly
must
encompass
all
those
activities
that
are
expressly
permitted
for
national
banks
by
the
national
bank
act.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
it
means
business
in
all
of
its
respects,
yes.
and
in
that
sense
it
would
encompass
the
express
powers
of
banks,
including,
it
has
been
held,
the
discount
brokerage
here
undertaken.
under
that
interpretation
therefore
the
comptroller's
ruling
which
permits
discount
brokerage
operations
at
any
location
and
not
simply
at
the
main
office
or
at
branches
is
contrary
to
law.
the
legislative
history,
however,
underscores
what
the
plain
language
to
section
81
indicates.
as
i
noted,
the
section
was
initially
passed
as
part
of
the
national
bank
act
of
1864.
as
passed,
the
statute
limited
the
usual
business
of
a
national
bank
to
one
location,
its
headquarters.
in
1927
congress
amended
the
statute
to
read
as
it
does
now,
the
general
business
of
a
national
bank
shall
be
conducted,
and
so
on.
now,
the
linguistic
change
itself,
i
suggest,
has
significance.
usual
in
its
ordinary
meaning
connotes
customary
or
traditional.
general,
i
suggest,
connotes
an
all-encompassing
intent,
a
broader
term.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
no
indication
in
the
legislative
history
one
way
or
the
other,
although
i
think
the
circumstances
make
it
fairly
plain,
and
they
are
these.
in
1927,
also
as
part
of
the
mcfadden
act,
congress
recognized
for
the
first
time
in
the
country's
history
the
authority
of
banks,
national
banks,
to
deal
in
securities.
it
had
not
theretofore
been
among
the
enumerated
powers.
so
at
the
same
time
that
congress
was
changing
the
term
in
81
from
usual,
customary,
traditional,
to
general,
all-encompassing,
it
was
adding
to
the
powers
of
banks
the
power
to
engage
in
the
business
of
dealing
in
securities.
there
was
nothing
to
suggest
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
include
that
newly
added
power
among
the
general
business
regulated
by
section
81.
indeed,
the
congressional
debates
are
full
of
statements
by
both
senators
and
representatives
that
the
securities
business
was
indeed
a
proper
part
of
the
business
of
a
bank.
in
fact,
even
in
this
case
the
comptroller
and
security
pacific
bank
argued
for
two
years
that
discount
brokerage
was
indeed
a
proper
part
of
the
business
of
banking.
if
i
may,
i
am
quoting
now
from
the
joint
appendix
before
the
court
of
appeals
in
this
case
at
a163.
security
pacific
bank
in
its
application
to
the
comptroller
to
conduct
discount
brokerage
and
to
conduct
it
on
a
nationwide
basis
said
"we
believe
that
these
facts",
the
facts
in
the
application,
"show
conclusively
that
the
purchase
and
sale
of
securities
are
part
of
the
"business
of
banking",.
"
so
we
had
the
bank,
when
it
was
trying
to
get
authorization
to
do
this
business,
arguing
that
conclusively
it
is
properly
part
of
the
business
of
banking.
now
having
gained
permission
to
do
it
we
have
the
bank
stating
that
absolutely
the
discount
brokerage
business
is
not
part
of
the
business
of
banking.
now,
i
suggest
they
can't
have
it
both
ways.
if
it
is
a
properly
authorized
bank
activity,
then
it
is
subject
to
the
locational
restrictions
on
those
activities.
i
suggest
also
that
had
congress
meant
to
limit
section
81
solely
to
the
traditional
business
of
banking,
essentially
what
the
argument
is
here
before
the
court
by
the
comptroller,
it
could
easily
have
done
so.
the
power
to
engage
in
investment
securities,
deal
in
securities
that
congress
added
in
1927
was
added
to
section
24
7th
which
sets
forth
the
powers
of
national
banks.
that
provision,
since
it
was
enacted
over
100
years
ago,
had
given
banks
all
such
incidental
powers
as
shall
be
necessary
to
carry
on
"the
business
of
banking",
so
it
is
quite
clear
that
congress
in
amending
the
statute
did
not
intend
to
use
the
same
language.
having
used
different
language
in
different
sections
of
the
same
statute,
it
is
to
be
assumed
they
meant
different
things.
"general"
is
clearly
broad
enough
to
cover
and
encompass
the
traditional
business
of
banking
and
the
business
of
buying
and
selling
in
securities
then
permitted.
let
me
then
turn,
if
i
may,
to
section
36
of
the
statute.
we
think
it
is
unnecessary
to
reach
section
36
and
the
definitional
question
because
we
believe
the
case
is
covered
by
section
81.
even,
however,
if
section
36
is
examined,
the
conclusion
is
the
same.
that
section,
as
counsel
said,
defines
the
term
"branch"
as
including
certain
geography...
to
include
certain
geography
and
at
which
deposits
are
received
or
checks
paid
or
money
lent,
and
indeed
in
the
plant
city
case
this
court
said
that
congress
intended
a
calculated
indefiniteness
about
the
term.
the
argument
under
36
here
really
is
whether
the
term
"include"
is
exclusive
or
illustrative.
that
is,
do
the
functions
listed
thereafter
simply
serve
as
illustrations,
or
are
they
in
fact
set
in
store
as
the
only
functions
permitted?
here
again,
the
legislative
history
tells
us
exactly
what
congress
meant.
the
mcfadden
bill
originated
in
the
house.
as
the
house
passed
the
bill,
section
8
of
the
mcfadden
bill
provided
that
the
general
business
of
a
bank
shall
be
carried
on
at
its
headquarters.
it
also
provided
that
for
branching
and
defined
a
branch
to
include
a
place
where
the
three
functions
are
carried
on.
it
did
not,
however,
also
provide
that
a
bank
might
carry
on
general
business
at
branches.
the
bill
then
went
to
the
senate,
which
marked
it
up,
and
in
the
markup
the
senate
changed
the
language
of
section
8
to
read
"the
general
business
of
a
national
bank
shall
be
conducted
at
headquarters
or
at
such
branches
as
may
be
established.
"
the
bill
then
went
to
conference
committee.
the
conference
accepted
the
senate
version.
the
conference
report,
the
statement
of
the
house
managers,
is
highly
significant
in
that
respect.
one
of
those
was
representative
mcfadden.
it
said
in
this
respect
the
senate
amendment
provides
that
national
banks
might
transact
general
business
not
only
at
the
place
specified
in
the
organization
certificate
but
also
at
such
branches
at
the
bank
might
lawfully
maintain
under
the
provisions
of
this
bill.
the
house
bill
contained
no
similar
provision,
and
the
house
recedes.
now,
representative
mcfadden,
who
is
one
of
the
authors
of
that
statement,
further
underscored
the
importance
of
the
change
in
the
statement
that
he
put
in
the
congressional
record.
he
said
about
section
36(f)
it
"defines
the
term
"branch"
any
place
outside
or
away
from
the
main
office
where
the
bank
carries
on
its
business
of
receiving
deposits,
paying
checks,
lending
money,
or
transacting
any
business
carried
on
at
the
main
office.
"
mr.
james
b.
weidner
section
36
does
not
specifically
state
that,
justice
white.
that
is
correct.
on
the
other
hand,
his
statement
is
directly
consistent
with
what
the
conference
committee
had
said
it
intended
to
do
in
accepting
the
senate
amendment
and
is
consistent
with
the
reading
of
the
word
"include"
as
being
illustrative.
the
fact
is,
if
we
accept
the
comptroller's
interpretation
of
section
36
we
have
a
logical
catch
22
at
least.
the
comptroller's
argument
is
that
the
three
functions
listed
in
36(f)
are
the
exclusive...
36(f)
is
limited
to
those
functions.
if
that
is
so,
remember,
36(f),
36
is
a
permissive
provision
allowing
branches,
those
three
functions
are
the
only
functions
that
could
be
conducted
in
branches.
thus
absent
a
branch
all
remaining
functions,
including
discount
brokerage,
would
remain
subject
to
the
overall
limitation
of
section
81.
mr.
james
b.
weidner
mr.
chief
justice,
however,
this
court
has
twice
held
that
indeed
the
meaning
of
section
81
is
to
limit
the
transaction
of
the
general
business
of
a
national
bank
to
one
office.
that
is
absent
section
36.
indeed,
in
1924,
the
court
addressed
the
question
of
whether
a
bank
had
power
to
multiply
the
places
at
which
it
exercises
its
powers
as
one
of
the
incidental
powers
of
banking.
the
court
concluded
it
did
not
have
such
incidental
power.
rather,
the
bank
was
limited
to
one
location
and
supported
that
conclusion,
citing
to
section
81.
the
court
reiterated
what
it
had
held
in
the
citizens
and
southern
case,
cited
in
our
brief.
in
fact,
it
was
this
court's
holding
in
january,
1924,
in
the
st.
louis
case
that
led
in
part
to
the
mcfadden
act.
mcfadden
proposed
his
bill
in
february,
1924,
to
remedy
the
problem,
in
his
view,
that
had
resulted
from
this
court's
decision
in
the
st.
louis
case.
so
as
construed
by
this
court
there
is
little
question,
i
suggest,
that
the
one
office
location
is
just
that,
is
a
one
office
location.
excuse
me,
furthermore,
not
only
do
we
think
that
there
is
a
logical
catch-22
if
the
comptroller's
interpretation
is
accepted.
there
is
a
further
problem.
banks
have
only
such
powers
as
are
expressly
granted
and
as
are
necessary
incidentally
to
carry
on
their
business.
it
is
a
fundamental
tenet
of
banking
law
so
held
by
this
court
repeatedly.
now,
in
the
st.
louis
case,
to
reiterate,
this
court
specifically
said
that
national
banks
do
not
have
the
incidental
power
to
multiply
the
places
at
which
their
powers
will
be
conducted.
therefore,
if
the
bank
has
authority,
the
power
to
multiply
the
places
at
which
it
conducts
its
business,
it
has
to
be
expressly
granted,
and
where
congress
expressly
granted
that
power
was
in
the
mcfadden
act,
section
36.
the
problem
is,
the
comptroller
has
said
that
brokerage
does
not
fall
within
provisions
of
section
36.
therefore
it
is
not
permitted
for
branches.
therefore,
because
it
does
not
have
the
incidental
power
to
multiply
where
it
will
carry
on
its
business,
the
places,
it
has
no
power
whatsoever.
so,
in
short,
we
believe
the
comptroller's
finding
was
contrary
to
the
direct
language
of
section
81
and
its
legislative
history,
is
contrary
to
section
36,
as
demonstrated
by
the
legislative
history
of
that
section,
and
furthermore
is
logically
inconsistent
or
leads
to
a
completely
illogical
conclusion,
that
is
to
say
that
either
the
business
is
limited
to
the
home
office
or
banks
have
no
power
whatsoever
to
do
what
he
has
authorized.
if
i
may,
let
me
turn
briefly
to
the
standing
question.
there
is
no
issue
here
as
to
constitutional
standing.
we
are
all
agreed
that
there
is
sufficient
adverseness
of
interest
under
article
3
to
create
a
case
or
controversy.
the
only
question
is
whether
the
prudential
zone
of
interest
rationale
should
slam
the
door
of
this
court
on
the
sia.
as
to
that
i
don't
think...
as
to
that,
that
is,
the
zone
of
interest
test,
i
don't
really
think
there
is
an
essential
dispute
between
the
sia's
position
and
that
of
the
government.
i
read
from
pages
10
and
11
of
the
government's
reply
brief.
they
agree
that
the
test
provides
that
in
the
face
of
congressional
silence
about
who
is
to
benefit
from
a
given
legislative
action
the
zone
test
is
satisfied
when
"congress
has
arguably
legislated
against
the
competition
that
the
plaintiff
seeks
to
challenge.
"
that
quote
is
from
this
court's
decision
in
investment
company
institute
v.
camp,
a
circumstance
virtually
identical
to
that
here.
in
camp
the
court
considered
the
comptroller's
ruling
permitting
national
banks
to
sell
shares
enclosed
in
investment
trust,
essentially
mutual
funds.
there
was
a
challenge
to
the
comptroller's
standing
in
that
case.
the
standing
was
upheld,
this
court's
finding.
because
congress
arguably
legislated
against
the
competitive
activity
at
issue,
sale
of
mutual
shares,
and
because
the
members
of
that
association,
much
like
the
members
of
the
sia,
were
adversely
affected
by
the
comptroller's
ruling,
and
because
there
was
no
preclusion
to
review
the
comptroller's
ruling
under
the
national
bank
act,
the
ici,
the
plaintiff
in
that
case,
had
standing.
the
court
has
made
clear
equally
in
that
case
as
well
as
the
data
processing
and
the
arnold
tours
cases,
which
preceded
it
on
the
standing
question
that
no,
it
is
not
necessary
to
show
specific
legislative
history,
that
specific
competitors
are
protected
by
congress,
nor
is
it
necessary
to
show
that
the
competition
which
is
challenged,
in
that
case
mutual
shares,
was
actually
prevented,
the
latter
simply
being
the
legal
interest
test,
which
was
rejected
in
those
three
cases,
in
essence
which
said
you
have
got
to
prove
you
could
win
your
case
before
you
could
get
into
court
to
prove
your
case.
we
are
in
the
same
circumstance
here.
the
sia
has
argued
and
we
believe
that
it
is
at
least
arguable
that
section
81
and/or
section
36,
but
certainly
section
81
limits
the
competition,
multiplication
of
offices
here
involved.
second,
admittedly
members
of
the
sia
are
adversely
affected
by
reducing
those
restrictions.
and
third,
the
court
has
already
held
that
there
is
no
preclusion
to
review
of
the
comptroller's
opinions
under
the
national
bank
act.
that
is
the
statute
which
is
involved
here.
therefore,
under
the
zone
rationale
as
articulated
by
this
court
in
camp
and
other
cases,
we
believe
the
sia
has
standing.
the
real
issue
here
is
again
what
is
the
relevant
statute?
the
comptroller
in
his
standing
analysis
as
essentially
in
his
substantive
analysis,
says
only
section
36
is
the
statute
that
is
involved,
essentially
ignoring
section
81.
well,
first,
in
our
view
that
is
to
focus
on
the
exception
and
ignore
the
rule.
the
fact
is,
81
was
put
in
the
statute
120
years
ago.
section
36
was
a
relaxation
of
the
one
office
restriction
permitting
additional
offices.
we
are
not
basing
our
case
on
the
relaxation.
we
are
basing
our
case
on
the
basic
restriction.
the
two
statutory
provisions
are
integrally
related.
we
suggest
they
both
should
be
interpreted
in
determining
standing.
section
81,
the
fundamental
locational
restriction,
is
but
one
example
of
a
policy
reflected
throughout
the
national
bank
act
that
in
light
of
the
importance
to
our
economic
society
and
the
economic
wallop
of
national
banks,
they
are
limited
both
in
where
they
can
conduct
their
business
and
what
business
they
can
conduct.
interpretations
reducing
those
boundaries
adversely
affect
competitors,
be
they
travel
agents,
be
they
mutual
funds,
be
they
data
processors,
or
be
they,
as
here,
securities
brokerage.
finally,
as
to
the
comptroller's
argument
under
section
36,
here,
too
there
is
an
anomaly.
the
argument
is
that
section
36
was
intended
solely
to
benefit...
i
believe
i
have
that
correct;
yes,
from
page

of
the
reply
brief...
state
banks,
and
because
state
banks
aren't
the
plaintiffs,
although
they
are
7,000
strong
in
amicus
on
behalf
of
the
sia
in
this
court,
because
they
are
not
technically
plaintiffs,
therefore
the
sia
has
no
standing,
it
is
not
a
state
bank,
but
the
fact
is
that
section
36
was
not
enacted
to
protect
state
banks.
recall
at
that
point
branching
was
prohibited
for
national
banks.
what
congress
intended
to
do
was
to
permit
national
banks
to
branch,
thereby
adversely
affecting
state
banks'
competitive
interests,
not
benefitting
or
protecting
them.
therefore
if
state
banks
have
standing
to
sue
and
everyone
agrees
that
they
do,
and
we
certainly
on
behalf
of
the
sia
agrees
that
they
do,
they
have
standing
because
they
are
significantly
involved
in
activities
that
are
affected
by
those
that
are
regulated,
here
the
national
banks.
that
is
essentially
simply
another
way
of
stating
this
court's
holding
in
ici

in
the

we

accordingly,
we
ask
the
court
to
affirm
the

both
as

and
as
to
