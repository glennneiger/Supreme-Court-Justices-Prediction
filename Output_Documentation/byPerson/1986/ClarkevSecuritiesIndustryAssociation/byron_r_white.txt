justice
white
i
take
it
the
argument
is,
or
at
least
one
of
the
arguments
is
that
this
kind
of
business
is
part
of
the
banking
business
and
the
statute
says
you
are
only
supposed
to
conduct
banking
business
at
your
main...
at
your
home
location
or
in
branches.
justice
white
was
that
presented
below?
justice
white
and
rejected?
justice
white
or
accepted?
it
wasn't
accepted?
justice
white
i
suppose
a
bank
could
conduct
in
non-branches
trust
business.
justice
white
does
the
comptroller
have
to
authorize
the
setting
up
of
a
bank
office
that
deals
in
securities?
justice
white
well,
he
has
been
doing...
he
has
been
doing
it--
justice
white
--so
his
approval
power
doesn't
suggest
that
what
he
is
approving
is
banking
business?
justice
white
this
is
just
that
he
has
general...
this
is
just
some
financial
concern.
justice
white
what
business,
the
banking
business?
justice
white
and
you
say
that
it
certainly
isn't
limited
to
that.
justice
white
what
happened
to
your
argument
below?
justice
white
what
happened
in
the
court
of
appeals?
justice
white
so
your
argument
here
wasn't
sustainable.
it
was
just--
justice
white
--yes.
justice
white
that
wasn't
the
rationale
of
the
district
court
or
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
white
of
course,
that
isn't
what
section
36
said.
he
added
those
words
on
the
end.
justice
white
just
competitors?
justice
white
the
court
did
in
this
case.
justice
white
well,
the
district
court
specifically
said
that
the
brokerage
business
is
part
of
the
general
business
of
the
bank.
justice
white
well,
isn't
that
the
whole
argument?
justice
white
how
can
you
leave
aside
that
opinion?
justice
white
you
say
that
no
court
has
ever
held
it.
justice
white
in
this
court
and
the
court
of
appeals,
too.
they
just
took
what
the
district
court
said.
justice
white
is
it
your
point
that
the
general
business
just
doesn't
include
brokerage?
justice
white
and
the
general
business
of
the
bank
is
the
business
that
they
perform
in
branches
or...
you
think
the
general
business
is
those
three
functions?
justice
white
may
banks
just
willy-nilly
engage
in
any
kind
of
business
they
want
to
as
long
as
it
isn't
specifically
prohibited?
justice
white
what
about,
could
they
just
set
up
a...
could
they
just
say,
well,
we
know
a
good
place
to
set
up
a
restaurant,
and
we
are
going
to
get
in
the
restaurant
business?
justice
white
why
couldn't
they
do
that?
justice
white
the
brokerage
business
is
one
of
those,
then?
justice
white
but
even
though
the
banks
are
specifically
authorized
to
buy
and
sell
securities,
it
is
not
part
of
their
general
business?
justice
white
that
isn't
what
it
says.
it
says
general
business.
justice
white
but
the
statute
permits,
specifically
permits
the
banks
to
do
this
as
part
of
their
business,
to
buy
and
sell
securities
as
part
of
their
business.
justice
white
but
that
is
not
part
of
their
general
business?
