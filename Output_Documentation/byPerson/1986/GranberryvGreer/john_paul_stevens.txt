justice
john
paul
stevens
the
second
case
involves
a
question
under
the
habeas
corpus
statute.
an
illinois
prisoner
filed
a
habeas
corpus
petition
in
the
federal
district
court
and
the
district
court
dismissed
it
on
the
merits.
in
the
court
of
appeals,
one
of
the
petitioner
appealed,
the
state,
for
the
first
time,
raised
the
defense
that
there
had
been
no
exhaustion
of
state
remedies.
the
petitioner
claimed
that
defense
had
been
waived
since
it
had
not
been
raised
in
the
district
court
but
the
court
of
appeals
thought
that
it
was
tantamount
to
a
jurisdictional
defense
although
not
strict
jurisdictional
and
thought
that
had
no
alternative
but
to
send
the
case
back
to
the
district
court
with
instructions
that
it
would
be
dismissed
so
the
petitioner
could
exhaust
the
state
remedies.
the
petitioner
has
come
here,
urging
that
that
defense
was
waived
and
we
take
the
middle
course,
we
do
not
hold
that
the
failure
to
raise
the
matter
was
jurisdictional
nor
do
we
hold
that
there
is
a
total
waiver
of
defense
by
the
state's
omission.
rather
we
hold
that
this
is
a
factor
that
the
court
of
appeals
may
take
into
consideration
in
deciding
whether
the
administration
of
justice
would
be
better
served
by
going
forward
and
addressing
the
merits
or
by
requiring
exhaustion
in
a
number
of
different
factors
would
affect
the
decisions.
so
we
send
the
case
back
to
the
seventh
circuit
to
reconsider
the
issue
in
the
light
of
our
opinion.
the
opinion
is
unanimous.
