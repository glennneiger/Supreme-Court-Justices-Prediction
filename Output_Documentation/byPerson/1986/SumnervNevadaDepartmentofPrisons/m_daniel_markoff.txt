mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue,
as
we
have
looked
at,
really
boils
down
to
something
very,
very
simple
here.
and
that's
whether
a
state
can
kill
a
person
without
at
least
giving
them
a
hearing
first
to
show
some
mitigating
factors
on
his
behalf.
as
was
previously
indicated,
every
state
in
the
united
states
has
repealed
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes
such
as
the
one
we
are
talking
about
here.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
would
suggest,
mr.
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
reason
we
had
the
mandatory
death
penalties
was
a
response
not
to
woodson
but
to
furman.
up
to
1963,
as
recognized
by
the
previous
opinions
of
this
court,
all
states
back
then
had
repealed
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes,
we
went
along,
and
then
we
had
furman
in
1971.
and
then
all
of
a
sudden,
reaction
to
that
decision,
they
passed
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes.
legislatures
pass
them.
however,
there
is
another
indicia
as
to
how
the
people
felt
at
approximately
that
time,
and
that
comes
in
the
form
of
opinion
forms
as
well,
perhaps
not
the
most
reliable
thing--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--that
people
at
that
point
in
time
did
not
favor
mandatory
death
penalty
statutes.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
this
court
has
recognized
that
there
are
several
ways
of
guaging
or
using
as
a
barometer,
how
the
people
have
felt.
the
standard
which
we
are
concerned
with
here
are
the
evolving
standards
of
human
decency
in
a
maturing
society.
and
the
court--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--well,
that's
what
i'm
leading
at.
the
legislators
have
indicated
their
feeling
on
it
by
repealing
all
these
statutes.
the
opinion
polls--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--i
would
submit
to
the
court
that
there
is
a
long
history
in
this
country
of
abhorrence
with
mandatory
death
penalties;
that
the
history
of
this
country
has
demonstrated
that,
over
the
years,
we
have...
if
the
death
penalty
is
to
be
imposed,
that
it
be
at
least
somewhat
discretionary,
and
now
it's
guided
discretion.
and
that
is
what
the
legislatures
have
done,
in
effect;
that's
what
the
court
has
approved,
this
court
has
approved.
and
i
wasn't
pulling
public
opinion
polls
out
of
my
hat.
that
was
referred
to
in
the
woodson
decision,
i
believe
it
was,
that...
just
as
another
indicia.
and
they
referred
to
a
poll
which
was
conducted
by
the
harris
survey
back
in
1974
or
'5
along
in
there.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
they
were
forecast.
my
recollection
is
that
they
were
not
approvingly
forecast;
that
they
figured
it
just
might
be
the
end
result
of
the
furman
decision.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
that
it
could
be
a
possible
result
of
furman,
and
indeed,
it
was.
so
we
had
these
things.
but
the
states,
i
submit,
were
not
comfortable
by
these
things,
as
is
indicated
by
what
has
happened.
they
have
all
disappeared,
and
we
are
left
with
this
relic
of
legislation
out
in
nevada.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
'64
or
'74?
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
woodson
came
after
furman.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
oh,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
okay.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
submit
that
we
were...
we
didn't
have
them
all
repealed
by
'63,
we
were
certainly
going
that
direction
in
having
them
all
repealed
until
the
furman
decision
came
out.
the
vast
majority
of
the
states
did
not
approve
this
type
of
a
sentencing
procedure.
so
what
we
then
have
is
the
standard
as
far
as
the
substantive
law
is
under
the
constitution,
the
eighth
amendment,
of
these
evolving
standards
of
human
decency
in
a
maturing
society.
we
have
also
submitted
to
the
court
that
the
statute
which
we
are
concerned
with
procedurally
violates
the
constitution,
and
that
such
a
mandatory
death
penalty,
because
of
its
unusual
nature,
cannot
be
imposed
in
an
arbitrary
and
capricious
fashion,
and
must
give
due
consideration
to
the
record
and
character
and
circumstances
of
the
offense.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
yes.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
that
isn't
correct,
i
submit.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
the
best
way
to
guage
the
punishment
that
mr.
shuman
is
continuing
to
suffer
at
this
point
in
time
is
by
simply
looking
at
the
case
on
which
he
was
originally
sentenced
in
1958,
where
he
was
given
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
as
the
court
has
already
noted,
our
client
was
not
the
killer
in
that
particular
case
in
1958.
the
codefendant
was.
the
codefendant
received
the
same
sentence
that
mr.
shuman
did,
which
was
life
without
parole.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
that's
precisely--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--that
is
precisely
what
i
am
referring
to,
the
codefendant
was
released
in
1977
on
parole.
he
is
no
longer
under
any
sentence
whatsoever
as
far
as
incarceration
is
concerned.
so
he's
been
free
for
10
years.
mr.
shuman,
because
of
his
actions
involved
in
this
very
case,
has
continued
to
be
in
prison
now
for
10
years,
and
in
all
likelihood,
will
be
in
prison
for
the
rest
of
his
life.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
that's
a
good
question.
perhaps
the
legislature
should
be
compelled
to
speak
english
or
something.
because
life
without
parole
does
not
mean
life
without
parole,
as
is
indicated
in
the
facts
of
this
very
case
right
here
involving
mr.
shuman's
codefendant.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
but
that's
exactly
what
the
situation
is.
the
possibility
of
parole
has
always
been
there,
and
always
has
been
for
other
defendants.
indeed,
in
the
presentence
report
for
mr.
shuman
which
was
prepared,
it
recognized...
in
the
presentence
report
that
was
prepared
in
1975
for
him
involving
this
case,
it
was
recognized
that
but
for
this
action,
he
could
have
probably
received
a
life
with
a
possibility
of
parole,
or
words
to
that
effect.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
don't
know.
i
would
submit
that
that
is
a
sentence
that
is
a
possibility.
and
of
course,
what
the
state
does
with
their
sentence
of
life
without
parole
is
up
to
the
state.
mr.
shuman
has
no
control
over
that.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
yes,
and
it
already
has
been.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
don't
believe
it
does.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
submit
that
it
is
an
important
fact,
but
it
never
came
up
in
the
lower
court
hearing.
the
district
court,
when
the
thing
was
heard
in
front
of
judge
reed--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--off
the
top
of
my
head,
sir,
i
don't
know.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
no,
it's
not.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
submit
it
is
important,
yes,
sir.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
well,
it's
a
matter
which
is
up
before
the
court.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
submit
that
it
is
a
matter...
the
sentence
which
is
imposed
upon
an
individual
remains
life
without
the
parole
until
the
parole
board
changes
it.
and
so
what
they
do
is
up
again
to
the
state.
i
can't
say--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--it's
a
western
way,
i
suppose.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
would
be
more
than
happy
to.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
because
we...
responding
to
the
state's
arguments,
what
we
saw
in
our
response
didn't
really...
or
this
particular
type
of
a
fact
or
a
matter
was
not
directly
responsive
to
what
they
were
representing.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
well,
perhaps
if
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole
meant
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
it
might
come
within
that
exception.
but
we
don't
even
have
that
situation.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
the
'75
conviction?
he
was
originally
sentenced
in
1958.
so
that's
'58
to
'73,
15
years
approximately.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
his
codefendant
was
released
in
1977,
according--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--as
far
as
i
know,
yes.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
have
no
further
facts
on
which--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--i'm
sure
there's
plenty
of
them
that
have
been.
i
can't
point
one
to
you
off
the
top
of
my
head,
but
i'm
sure
it
could
be
verified
very
quickly.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
it
is
possible.
that
could
happen.
judge
reed
in
the
lower
court,
in
the
u.s.
district
court
for
nevada,
had
sentence...
had
referred
the
matter
back
for
resentencing
in
front
of
the
state
courts.
and
then
of
course
the
state
took
their
appeal
to
the
ninth
circuit.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
it's
possible.
depending
of
course
upon
the
way
the
court
prefers
to
remand
it.
there
is
other
possibilities
that
are
available
for
this
individual
as
well.
people
who
have
been
sentenced
under
the
mandatory
statute
in
nevada
have
had
their
sentences
just
made
simply
consecutive
to
any
other
life
without
parole
that
they
were
doing.
for
instance,
if
a
person
killed
two
policemen
or
something
like
that,
under
the
old
mandatory
statute,
he
would
have
two
consecutive
life
sentences
then.
i
submit
to
the
court
also
that
there
are
a
number
of
mitigating
factors
that
could
have
been
submitted
to...
to
the
court
on
behalf...
and
i'm
talking
about
submitting
to
the
state
court
on
behalf
of
mr.
shuman
if
it
had
been
allowed.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
no.
what
i
am--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--no,
the
possible
penalty
he'd
be
subject
to
would
be
life
without
parole
consecutive
to
the
one
he's
already
doing.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
well,
the
way
it
works,
apparently--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--currently?
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
the
current
system
is
one
of
having
a
bifurcated
system
with
mitigating
factors
being
presented.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
to
the
jury,
yes,
and
they
make
the
decision.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
no,
sometimes
there's
a
three-judge
panel
that
could
be
involved
in
a
particular
case.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
normally
the
judge,
who
has
a
range
of
years
from
which
he
can
pick.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
right,
that's
correct.
as
i
was
saying,
these
mitigating
factors
that
should
be
either
examined--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--in
this
particular
case,
it
would
be
to
the
jury,
if
it
was
a
jury
trial.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
well,
that's
correct.
so
we're
looking
now
perhaps
if
it's--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--the
jury,
under
the
old
system
in
nevada,
had
nothing
to
say
but
guilty
or
innocent,
one
or
the
other.
under
the
new
system,
the
jury
has
the
ability
to
consider
mitigating
factors.
i
submit
that
the
constitution--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--no,
i'm
not.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
we
are
asking
for
something
very
minimal,
and
that's
just
the
opportunity
to
present
something
at
the
hearing.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
perhaps.
but
that
would
be
up
to
the
judge
what
he
would
feel
under
the
circumstances.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
that's
basically
it.
that's
all
the
law...
well,
unless
of
course,
the
death
penalty
still
applies,
and
they
could
resentence
and
give
him
that
again,
also.
but
to
this
day,
he
has
not
even
had
any
sort
of
a
hearing
concerning
anything
in
his
life,
which
is
interesting.
because
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
the
1958
case,
the
jury
set
the
penalty
there.
sure,
there
was
perhaps
some
mitigating
factors
that
were
introduced,
as
far
as
the
actual
defense
was
concerned
in
1958;
and
the
same
thing
could
be
said
for
'75.
but
there
was
nothing
presented
that
i
am
aware
of
concerning
this
individual's
background,
his
psychological
condition,
his
youth,
anything.
even
'58
he
never
got
the
hearing
as
far
as
those
hearings
are
concerned...
'75.
so
we
are
looking
here
at
a
man
who
is
about
to
be
killed,
perhaps,
and
nobody
has
never
heard
anything
about
his
life
in
detail
at
all.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
eighteen...
in
'73?
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
think
he
was
38.
i
believe
he
was
40
at
the
time
of
the
trial.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i'm
not
aware
whether
solitary
confinement
as
part
of
the
statutory
scheme
would
be
available.
however,
certainly
as
far
as
administrator
framework,
it
may
be
available
if
he
is
considered
that
big
of
a
danger.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
no,
but
perhaps
wardens...
they
have
what
they
often
call
administrative
segregation.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
well,
i
would
imagine
that--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--not
in
any
detail.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
all
i
know
is
from
a
general
perspective,
and
that's--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--not
in
terms
of
punishment,
perhaps.
in
terms
of
protection
for
other
inmates.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
they
might
have
a
basis
for
differentiating
between
them.
but
even
at
this
point
in
time,
if
my
memory
serves
me
correctly,
mr.
shuman
is
not
on
death
row.
he's
in
general
population.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
i
suppose
he
could.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
it
is
a
possibility.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
it
is
a
major
risk,
yes.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
because
that's
another
option
that's
available
if
a
jury
is
to
hear,
or
the
sentencer
whoever
it
may
be,
is
to
hear
mitigating
factors
on
behalf
of
this
person.
it
just
gives...
we
want
the
hearing,
if
it's
to
be
sent
back,
so
a
jury
can
or
a
sentencer
can
determine
whether
there
are
mitigating
factors
for
this
person.
it's
a
small
thing
to
ask,
but
the
consequences
for
mr.
shuman
are
very
severe.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
depending
on
the
facts
as
they
were
to
be
presented
at
a
hearing.
it's
hard
to
forecast
exactly
how
it
would
come
down
at
the
state
court
level
again.
as
perhaps--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--we
think
that
is
one
of
the
options
that
is
available
to
the
court.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
yes.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
that's
what
district
judge
reed
did
do.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
as
i
read
it,
that's
correct.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
it
is
further
ordered
that
said
ramond
wallace
shuman
is
discharged
and
released
from
confinement
on
account
of
his
sentence
pronounced
in
case
no.
33-259,
unless
the
state
within
120
days
of
this
date
orders,
initiates,
and
completes
a
lawful
resentencing
proceeding
in
accordance
with
this
order.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
no,
no,
the
death
sentence
which
had
been
imposed
at
that
time.
i
submit
some
of
the
mitigating
factors
that
the
court
would
consider
would
be
his
mental
and
emotional
condition,
his
age,
his
youth
and
background
such
as
it
was
before
he
went
to
prison,
the
fact
that
the
codefendant
was
released
in
1977,
ten
years
ago;
the
conduct
of
the
victim
as
well
in
this
case,
which
is
sometimes,
under
some
of
the
state
death
penalty
statutes,
one
of
the
mitigating
factors
to
be
considered;
as
well
as
his
record
in
the
institution,
and
whether
or
not
the
system
itself
contributed
in
anyway
to
this
whole
incident
coming
about.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
that's
certainly
a
possibility,
justice
scalia.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
uh-huh.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
we
did
not
seek
to
introduce
anything.
this
came
to
us
on
a
writ
of
habeas
corpus
to
the
federal
system.
he
was
represented
by
the
state
public
defender--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--none
was
proffered
because
it
wasn't
permitted.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
well,
the
fact
is
that
that
was
not
really
the
issue
that
was
being
litigated
at
the
time.
the
issue
was
whether
or
not
he
should
ever
even
have
a
hearing
to
present
it
in
the
state
court.
and
judge
reed
concluded
that
he
hadn't
been
given
that
opportunity,
and
he
should
be.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
well--
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
--well,
i'm
pointing
to
some
of
them
right
here,
and
the
fact
that
the
codefendant
was
released,
for
instance,
ten
years
ago;
that
life
without
parole
doesn't
mean
life
without
parole.
mr.
m.
daniel
markoff
no,
no,
it's
mitigating
evidence
as
to
why
the
death
penalty
shouldn't
be
imposed.
they
say
he's
in
this
particular
class
of
people
that
are
never,
ever
to
be
released
in
society
again.
and
yet
here
you
have
a
codefendant
in
the
same
situation
who
is
released
into
society
again.
and
certainly
a
jury
should
be
able...
or
a
sentencer
should
be
able
to
take
that
into
account
as
well.
i
submit,
however,
that
the
district
court,
the
u.s.
district
court,
was
not
concerned
with
the
actual
facts,
but
whether
there
should
be
an
opportunity
for
a
hearing
to
hear
these
mitigating
factors
in
the
state
court
before
a
sentencer.
i
submit
to
the
court,
also,
that
there
are
numerous
policy
reasons,
and
therefore,
supporting
our
position
that
the
constitution
mandates
a
mitigation
hearing
in
these
cases,
as
to
why
you
should
be
entitled
to
have
a
mitigation
hearing.
first
of
all,
the
only
person
to
lose
anything
as
a
result
of
this
sentence,
if
you
will,
is
going
to
be
mr.
shuman.
he
will
be
executed,
and
that
will
be
it
for
him.
if
you
have
a
mitigation
hearing,
the
state
doesn't
lose
anything.
they
could
still
seek
perhaps
the
same
punishment.
so
they're
not
out
of
the
ballpark,
so
to
speak.
the
state
interests
are
also
served
by
a
discretionary
death
penalty
statute,
if
you
order
having
a
mitigating
hearing.
because
they
can
still
seek
the
same
thing,
as
i
indicated.
they're
not
going
to
lose
out
on
making
their
arguments.
and
it's
also
an
interest
of
a
state,
i
submit,
that
they
hear
whether
a
life
is
worth
saving;
i
submit
that
they
cannot
close
their
ears
and
bury
their
head
in
the
sand
before
they
hear
about
a
person's
life
and
just
send
him
off
to
be
executed.
another
extremely
important
factor
is
that
no
legislature
can
ever
forecast
all
the
mitigating
factors
of
a
person's
life.
the
state,
in
effect,
has
conceded
this
by
changing
the
law
in
nevada
10
years
ago,
in
1977,
by
allowing
the
hearing
of
mitigating
factors.
the
argument
that
the
state
has
raised,
in
saying
that
these
types
of
individuals
should
never,
ever
have
the
possibility
of
being
out
in
society
again,
and
should
be
automatically
executed,
is
belied
by
the...
and
contradicted
by
the
own
conduct
of
the
state
in
providing
for
the
present
scheme
that
they
now
have.
i
submit
to
the
court,
also,
that
not
all
people
who
do
life
are
necessarily
murderers.
you
could
be
an
aider
and
abetter,
perhaps,
or
it
could
come
under
the
felony
murder
rule,
or
something
of
that
nature.
finally...
thank
you
very
much.
