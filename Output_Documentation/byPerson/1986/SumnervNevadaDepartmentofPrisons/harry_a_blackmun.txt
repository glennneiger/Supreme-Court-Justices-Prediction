blackmun
it
so
happens,
he
was
not
the
triggerman
in
the
other
one?
justice
blackmun
if
this
judgment
is
affirmed,
the
individual
just
stays
on
for
life?
justice
blackmun
mr.
markoff,
am
i
not
correct
that
in
some
of
the
furman
opinions,
mandatory
death
sentence
statutes
were
forecast,
as
a
result
of
furman?
justice
blackmun
well,
they
weren't
approved.
but
they...
it
was
indicated
this
would
be
the
result
of
furman
at
that
time.
justice
blackmun
mr.
markoff,
i
want
to
be
sure
of
one
thing.
if
you
prevail
here,
is
your
client
subject
now
to
the
system
that
is
provided
by
the
current
statute
so
that
he
might
receive
the
death
penalty?
justice
blackmun
so
he
still
may
end
up
by
being
executed?
justice
blackmun
do
you
have
jury
sentencing
in
nevada?
justice
blackmun
yes.
justice
blackmun
by
the
jury,
not
the
judge.
justice
blackmun
is
that
true
all
throughout
your
criminal
system,
jury
sentencing,
as
in
most
of
the
southern
states?
justice
blackmun
suppose
somebody
is
up
for
robbery;
he's
convicted.
who
imposes
the
sentence
in
nevada?
justice
blackmun
i'm
still
confused
by
all
this
talk
about
a
second
life
sentence
without
parole.
because
the
death
penalty
is
still
a
possibility
at
the
end
of
whatever
hearing
comes
along,
is
it
not?
justice
blackmun
isn't
that
the
major
risk
that
you're
running--
justice
blackmun
--then
why
all
this
talk
about
a
second
life
sentence
without
parole?
