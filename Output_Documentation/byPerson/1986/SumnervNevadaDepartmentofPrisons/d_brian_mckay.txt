mr.
d.
brian
mckay
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
the
state
of
nevada
is
here
today
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals.
that
federal
circuit
court
of
appeals
held
a
nevada
statute,
which
provided
for
the
mandatory
imposition
of
a
death
penalty
under
certain
circumstances,
unconstitutional.
that
holding
of
the
ninth
circuit
was
contrary
to
a
holding
of
the
highest
court
in
nevada,
the
nevada
supreme
court,
which
addressed
the
same
question,
and
held
it
to
be
constitutional
under
both
the
u.s.
constitution,
and
the
nevada
constitution.
which
brings
us
here
this
morning
to
the
issue,
to
the
question
that
is
presented
for
this
court's
determination
this
morning.
which
is:
did
the
imposition
of
a
mandatory
death
penalty
on
an
inmate,
convicted
of
premeditated
murder
while
serving
a
sentence
of
life
in
prison
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
imposed
for
an
earlier,
unrelated
first
degree...
first
degree
murder
conviction,
constitute
a
cruel
and
unusual
punishment
as
prohibited
by
the
eighth
and
fourteenth
amendments
of
the
united
states
constitution.
the
state
of
nevada
submits
that,
no,
it
did
not.
the
imposition
of
a
mandatory
death
sentence
in
this
case
did
not
violate
the
eighth
amendment,
or
did
not
violate
any
other
provisions
of
the
united
states
constitution;
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
decision
was
incorrect
for
the
following
reasons.
first,
the
nevada
statute
is
consistent...
was
consistent...
with
the
basic
tenets,
the
basic
holdings
of
the
eighth
amendment,
that
in
death
penalty
cases
there
be
an
individualized
consideration
of
the
character,
in
this
case
of
the
inmate,
his
record,
and
the
circumstances
of
the
latest
murder.
secondly,
nevada
submits
that
its
statute,
as
drawn
at
that
time,
narrowly
defined
the
class
of
persons
who
were
eligible
for
imposition
of
a
mandatory
death
penalty.
only
the
most
incorrigible
of
people
were
subject
to
this
ultimate
sanction:
those
who
are
serving
a
life
term,
a
life
sentence,
without
the
possibility
of
parole
who
then
commit
another
first
degree
murder
and
are
convicted
of
that.
there's
been
a
societal
decision
to
remove
these
people
forever
from
free
society.
their
criminal
behavior
is
so
unacceptable
that
there
has
been
a
determination
that
rehabilitation
in
these
instances
is
simply
not
possible.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
your
honor,
there
are
no
mandatory
death
penalties
currently
on
the
books
today.
i
believe
all
of
the
states
reacted
to
this
court's
decision
in
woodson
and
roberts.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
well,
your
honor,
if
we're
talking
about
the
predicate
offense
that
created
the
life
sentence
in
the
first
place--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--well,
first
of
all,
under
the
nevada
statute
and
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
that's
not
what
occurred.
but
if
it
is
a
felony
murder
that
occurs
within
the
prison
walls
during
his
incarceration,
i
don't
think
that
would
make
any
difference.
i
don't
think
that's
an
extenuating
circumstance.
this
individual...
any
person
who
fits
within
this
category...
has
already
been
placed
within
a
very
narrowly
defined
category
of
eligibility.
so
we
believe
that--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
the
legislature
singled
out
three
or
four
categories,
that
is
correct,
as
seriously
aggravating
crimes.
the
state
of
nevada
concedes
that
the
other
categories,
other
than
this,
simply
would
not
pass
constitutional
muster
under
this
court's
intervening
decisions.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
no,
the
nevada
legislature
has
not
done
that.
they
reacted,
again,
to
this
court's
decision
in
woodson
and
roberts,
and
they
abolished
all
mandatory
death
penalties
in
1977
because
nevada
legislature,
reacting
to
the
people
of
the
state,
very
much
wanted
death
penalty
statute
sanction
on
the
books.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
in
this
particular
case,
your
honor,
i
believe
that
that
could
occur
under
nevada
law,
as
it
exists
today.
but
that
would
create
significant
other
problems,
i
think,
in
light
of
the
length
that
this
case
is
in
the
appellate
process.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
so
we
believe
that
the
statute
as
defined
and
applied
in
this
case
is
qualitatively
different
than
any
other
class
of
eligibility
that
could
possibly
exist.
nevada
also
submits
that
there
is
no
other
sanction
that
could
be
adequate
or
meaningful
if
it
were
not
able
to
impose
a
death
penalty
in
this
particular
case.
without
a
death
penalty,
the
latest
crime,
the
latest
murder,
committed
by
this
respondent
would
simply
go
unpunished.
we
submit
that
there
comes
a
time
when
mere
confinement
is
not
longer
a
sufficient
penalty.
we
also
believe--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--currently
the
other
states
do
the
same
thing
as
the
state
of
nevada,
justice
marshall,
and
they
provide--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--the
other
states
provide
for
the
bifurcated
proceeding.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
nevada
does
the
same
today,
your
honor.
this
statute
was
only
in
effect
from
1973--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--yes,
you're
dealing
with...
with
one
individual
who
was
charged--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--one
case.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
we
want--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--we
want
to
uphold
the
integrity
of
our
criminal
justice
system
in
the
state
of
nevada.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
not
according
to
the--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--that
is
correct.
not
under
the
procedure
provided
by
nevada
law
for
that
four-year
period
between
1973
and
1977.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
that
is
correct.
and
that's
the
next
point
that
i
was
going
to
come
to,
your
honor.
there
has
been
a
legislative
determination,
or
there
was
a
legislative
determination,
by
the
elected
representatives
of
the
people
of
the
state
that
a
mandatory
death
penalty
was
in
fact
necessary
to
enhance
the
valid
goals
of
criminal
justice
that
this
court
has
recognized,
the
goals
of
retribution,
of
deterrence,
and
of
incapacitation.
and
if
that
legislative
judgment,
provided
of
course
that
it
comports
with
the
basic
requirements
of
the
eighth
amendment
and
the
other
constitutional
provisions
that
apply
to
death
penalty
cases,
is
entitled
to
great
deference
by
this
court.
additionally,
there
is
no
question
in
this
case
as
to
the
personal
culpability,
the
personal
responsibility,
the
moral
guilt
of
the
respondent;
that's
been
conceded.
this
court
has
also
been
greatly
concerned
with
the
reliability
of
the
process
of
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty.
we
would
submit
that
the
quality
of
the
record
in
this
case
makes
clear
that
the
process
has
been
reliable.
there's
been
no
wanton,
arbitrary,
capricious
or
irrational
imposition
in
this
case.
addressing
the
respondent's
primary
argument
that
has
been
made,
and
his
reliance
upon
eddings
v.
oklahoma,
i
think
revolves
around
this
court's
holding
in
eddings
v.
oklahoma.
the
court
held
in
that
case
that
when
a
statute
that
provided
for
aggravating
and
mitigating
circumstances
was
on
the
books,
and
had
to
be
addressed
before
there
could
be
an
imposition
of
the
death
penalty,
that
the
sentencer
was
required
to
give
weight
and
to
consider
any
and
all
mitigating
circumstances,
and
that
they
could
not
preclude
consideration
of
mitigating
circumstances.
that
was
the
major
holding
in
the
eddings
case,
and
citing
back
to
lockett
v.
ohio.
that
case
was
not
a
mandatory
death
penalty
case.
that
case
did
not
involve
the
inmate
who
was
serving
a
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
i
submit
to
this
court
that
eddings
v.
oklahoma
did
not
say
that
in
each
and
every
capital
case
that
any
and
all
mitigating
circumstances
had
to
be
presented
to
the
sentencer
prior
to
the
imposition
of
a
sentence
at
a
separate
sentencing
hearing.
the
court
simply
didn't
hold
that.
i
believe
that
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
has
put
words
in
this
court's
mouth
that
it
has
yet
to
utter
on
this
particular
subject.
therefore,
because
none
of
the
constitutional
infirmities
that
have
been
found
by
this
court
in
the
past
in
furman,
in
woodson,
in
lockett,
in
coker,
in
inman,
in
eddings,
simply
do
not
exist
in
the
case,
in
this
particular
case,
because
they
simply
are
not
there;
that
nevada's
mandatory
death
penalty
statute
at
that
time,
imposing
a
mandatory
death
penalty
on
inmates
who
commit
a
murder
while
serving
a
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole
is
constitutional;
and
that
such
a
holding
would
be
consistent
with
this
court's
prior
holding
on
mandatory
death
cases.
we
also
submit
that
shuman's
death
sentence
is
valid
as
applied
under
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
that
the
ninth
circuit
decision
needs
to
be
reversed.
now
the
legal
issue
in
this
case
has
arisen
from
the
following
facts,
which
i
think
are
necessary
and
appropriate
to
briefly
go
over.
in
1973
the
respondent,
raymond
wallace
shuman,
was
incarcerated
in
the
nevada
state
prison,
where
he
was
serving
a
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
having
been
convicted
of
a
prior
first
degree
murder.
while
incarcerated
in
prison
in
1973,
he
became
embroiled
in
an
argument
with
the
inmate
occupying
an
adjacent
cell.
that
argument
was
over
the
opening
and
closing
of
a
window.
respondent
elected
to
resolve
that
argument
by
pouring
flammable
liquid
all
over
the
inmate
and
lighting
him
on
fire.
as
a
result
of
this
burning,
the
inmate
died
three
days
later.
respondent
was
charged
with
murder.
he
was
tried
in
1975
by
a
jury.
he
testified
on
his
own
behalf.
he
testified
as
to
his
character.
he
testified
as
to
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
other
witnesses
testified
on
his
behalf.
nonetheless,
the
jury
found
his
guilty
of
capital
murder,
and
under
nevada
law,
in
effect
at
that
time,
a
mandatory
death
sentence
was
required.
also
under
nevada
law
at
that
time,
the
automatic
appellate
process
began.
in
1978,
the
nevada
supreme
court
upheld
both
the
conviction
of
the
respondent
and
the
imposition
of
the
mandatory
death
sentence,
specifically
recognizing
this
court's
intervening
decisions
in
woodson
v.
north
carolina
and
roberts
v.
louisiana.
the
court,
the
nevada
supreme
court,
held
that
this
was
that
rare
and
unique
circumstance
that
the
court
had
alluded
to
in
gregg,
and
had
specifically
footnoted
in
woodson
and
in
roberts.
the
court
found
that
there
simply
could
not
be
any
mitigating
circumstances
in
a
case
such
as
this
that
would
allow
for
this
latest
crime,
this
latest
murder,
to
go
unpunished.
as
a
result
of
that...
and
the
court
also
found,
for
what
it's
worth,
that
the
respondent
was
entitled
and
not
precluded
from
introducing
mitigating
evidence
or
mitigating
circumstances
on
his
behalf.
respondent
then
initiated
post-conviction
proceedings--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--he
was
not
precluded
from
introducing
any
evidence
of
any
kind--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--including
mitigating,
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
well,
the
mitigating
circumstances--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--no,
but
could...
there
were
lesser--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--as
far
as
this
court's
later
holding,
that
in
bifurcated
proceedings
of
aggravating
versus
mitigating,
the
answer
to
your
question
is,
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
well--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--only
to
reduce
a
potential
verdict,
because
there
were
lesser
included
offenses
at
the
time.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
your
honor,
they
did.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
i
am
trying
to
recall
what
the
jury
instructions
were.
apparently
the
jury
was
not
instructed
that
it
was
mandatory.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
no,
i
don't
know.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
no,
sir.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
just
the
issue
of
guilt,
because
then
the
sentence
was
mandatory
if
he--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--essentially,
that
is
what
has
occurred,
yes,
your
honor.
he
had
no
alternative.
the
respondent
then
commenced
post-conviction
proceedings
in
the
state
district
court--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--i
believe
that
there
were,
your
honor,
yes.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
after
the
state
post-conviction
proceedings
were
unsuccessful,
the
respondent
commenced
federal
habeas
corpus
proceedings
in
a
federal
district
court
for
the
district
of
nevada.
a
number
of
issues
were
raised
in
those
habeas
proceedings.
he
attacked
his
1958
conviction.
he
attacked
his
1975
conviction.
and
of
course,
the
imposition
of
the
mandatory
death
penalty
sentence.
also
during
those
habeas-corpus
proceedings,
respondent
requested
or
asked
to
be
allowed
to
present
evidence
of
mitigating
circumstances,
assumedly
because
this
court
had
handed
down
its
intervening
decisions
that
allowed
and
addressed
that
particular
subject.
the
court
ordered
respondent
to
provide
a
specification
of
proof
before
deciding
whether
to
hold
an
evidentiary
hearing,
and
respondent
never
provided
any
evidence
that
there
were
or
could
have
been
any
mitigating
circumstances
to
lessen
a
death
penalty
sentence
in
1975.
finally,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
address
the
whole
concept
of
appellate
review
as
it
applies
to
a
death
penalty
case
such
as
this.
so
that
we
can
assure
that
there
has
been...
the
court
can
be
assured
that
there
has
been
no
imposition
of
a
death
penalty
without
the
individual
examination
of
the
character,
of
the
record,
and
the
circumstances
of
the
offense.
this
court
has
held
in
its
more
recent
decisions,
zant
v.
stephens,
cabana,
even
in
pulley,
that
to
some
extent
there
is
the
availability
of
appellate
review
to
ensure
that
there
have
been
no
constitutional
violations
before
a
death
penalty,
the
ultimate
sanction
is
imposed.
in
zant,
i
believe
the
court
held
that
if
there
is
a
narrow
definition,
if
the
class
of
eligibility
is
so
narrowed
that
you
have
only
a
small
class
of
people
who
are
eligible,
and
if
there
has
been
an
individualized
consideration,
then
certain
findings
can
be
made
at
the
appellate
level.
we
believe
that
the
court
has
the
unusual
opportunity
to
look
at
the
facts
of
this
case
as
if
it
were
in
a
laboratory.
there
can
be
a
microscopic
review
of
everything
that
occurred,
everything
that's
finite.
there
are
no
extraneous
contaminations
that
come
into
play.
there's
a
limited
application.
the
statute
came
into
effect
in
1973.
nevada's
legislative
response
to
this
court's
determination
in
furman
v.
georgia,
and
it
went
out
of
existence
in
1977,
nevada's
legislative
response
to
this
court's
determinations
in
woodson
and
in
roberts.
so
we
would
submit
that,
again,
there
is
a
narrow
class
of
individuals
who
are
qualitatively
different
from
any
other
conceivable
class
of
individuals
who
could
be
subject
to
the
death
penalty.
only
if
an
individual
commits
a
first
degree
murder
and
is
convicted,
and
has
been
serving
a
life
sentence
in
prison,
a
life
sentence
that
a
jury
previously
found
was...
made
him
eligible
for
this
sentence,
and
the
crime
was
so
serious,
and
his
character
and
his
record
so
required,
that
that
life
sentence
be
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
that
he
should
never
be
put
in...
back
into--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--pardon?
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
sir,
and
was
committed
prior
to
1977.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
that
is
correct.
it
applies
to
one
person
and
one
person
only.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
in
1958,
he
was
not
the
triggerman
for
that
first
degree
murder
conviction,
no,
not
for
the
predicate
offense.
there
is
no
question
that
he
was
the
perpetrator
of
the
1975
offense...
1973
offense
for
which
the
mandatory
death
penalty
was
imposed.
so
we
would
submit
that
the
nevada
mandatory
statute
in
effect
at
that
time
was
constitutional,
and
would
not
be
inconsistent
with
this
court's
other
determinations.
if
there
are
no
other
questions,
i
would
like--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--eddings
v.
oklahoma,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
well,
but
it...
i
would
submit
that
it
didn't
have
to
say
this
particular
categories
of
murders.
because
it
was
quoting
from
lockett,
but
eddings
was
not
a
mandatory
death
penalty
case.
it
did
not
involve
a
life...
an
inmate
serving
a
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole...
of
parole.
so
i
would
just
submit
that
in
reducing
the
quote
for
that
case,
that's
what
occurred,
it
certainly
was
not
a
holding
by
this
court
that
that
exception
was
now
extinguished.
that's
what
the
ninth
circuit
believes
that
this
court
did,
is
extinguish
eddings.
that's
what
respondent
has
argued.
we
respectfully
submit
that
that
is
not
what
the
court
did
in
eddings
v.
oklahoma.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
your
honor,
yes,
it
is
our
position
that
would
be
irrelevant.
and
let
me
just
carry
that
one
step
forward.
he
killed
in
1958.
he
killed
again
in
1973.
does
that
mean
he's
going
to
kill
again
in
1988?
do
we
wait
until
he
is
on
his
normal
schedule?
he
has
been
found
to
be
a
person
who
should
be
removed
from
society.
he
then
committed
murder.
there
simply
can
be
no
other
sanction
it
the
death
penalty
cannot
be
imposed
in
this
case.
the
murder
will
go
unpunished.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
it
would
still
be
irrelevant.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
no,
that
is
correct.
that
was
pure
speculation
on
my
part,
and
we
would
not--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
that
is
correct.
if
this
judgment
is
affirmed
and
he
remains,
he
is
submitted
to
one
more
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
so
he
has
not--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--well,
depending
on
the
order
of
the
court,
that
is
correct;
depending
on
the
fashion
of
the
order.
but--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--that's
correct.
well,
nevada
law
provided
at
that
time,
i
might
point
out,
that
if
the
death
penalty
was
held
unconstitutional,
then
it
would
become
a
life
without
sentence.
but
since
that
time
we
enacted
our
bifurcated
proceedings,
so
i
would
assume
that
we
could
go
forward
on
that.
i'm
not
positive.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
sir.
if
the
court
has
no
additional
questions,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
sir,
that's
the
first
thing,
your
honor,
i
was
going
to
do.
under
the
state...
under
the
laws
of
the
state
of
nevada,
then
and
now,
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole
means
life
without
the
possibility
of
parole.
there
are
only
two
circumstances
in
which
it
does
not:
if
clemency
is
granted
by
the
pardons
board;
or
if
the
sentence
has
been
reversed
by
an
appellate
court
at
any
level.
those
are
the
only
circumstances--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--this
codefendant,
i
suspect,
being
imprisoned
for
20
years,
made
an
application
to
the
pardons
board.
and
if
his
record
was
such
that
they
felt--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--the
pardons
board.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
sir.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
the
parole
board
has
no
authority
under
nevada
law,
did
not
then,
does
not
now,
to
reduce
a
life
without
sentence.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
that
is
my...
oh
as
to
what
happened
to--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--it
is
my
supposition
that
that
is
what
happened.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
the
fact
of
the
pardon,
your
honor,
we
can
find
that
out.
but
it
was
not
a
parole
board
making
a
determination
that
that
sentence
could
be
reduced.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
sir,
we
can.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
we
know
that
he's
out.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
i'm
not
sure
if
the
pardons
board
has
those
statistics
your
honor.
i
sit
on
the
pardons
board--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--they
are
not
officially
reported
in
any
publication.
they
are
not.
the
state,
i
assume,
keeps
records
of
that.
as
i
said,
i
am...
the
pardons
board
is
the
governor,
the
attorney
general,
and
the
five
justices
of
the
supreme
court.
those
are
the
composition
of
that
board;
it
meets
twice
a
year.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
they
do.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes,
they
do.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
they
have
an
absolute
right,
yes,
they
do,
under--
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
--it
is
asking
for...
it
is
a
clemency
proceeding
that
is
not
a
matter
of
right.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
yes.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
reducing
a
life
without
to
a
life
with.
i
don't
know
of
any.
if
any,
there's
been
one,
and
it's
been
for
health
reasons.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
i
can't
tell
you
for
sure
if
it's
been
within
the
last
year.
i've
served
on
that
board
for
five
years.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
from
life
without
to
life
with,
yes,
it's
probably
happened
one
or
two
times.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
no,
since
i've
served
on
the
board
in
that
five
year
period.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
i
can't
tell
you
statistically,
your
honor,
if
that
is
the
case.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
i'm
just...
i
just
can't
answer
that
question
for
sure.
i
know
it's
happened
for
health
reasons,
i
can't
tell
you
if
a
life
without
has
been
reduced
to
a
life
with.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
again,
without
looking
at
the
statistics,
i
can't
tell...
i
cannot
tell
you
from
my
own
knowledge.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
they
do
not
have
a
statutory
right
to
a
hearing.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
under
the
policy
of
the
board,
they
are
entitled
to
a
hearing.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
two...
ten.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
ten.
we
have
two
a
year.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
no,
there
are
anywhere
from
three
to
seven
applicants
on
the
average.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
that
is
correct.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
we're
just
talking
about
life
without.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
there
are
not
very
many
life
withouts
that
come
on
before
the
pardons
board.
mr.
d.
brian
mckay
it
covers
any
type
of...
any
type
of
clemency
is
the
purpose
of
the
board,
and
this
is
just
one
particular
area.
let
me
go...
let
me
please
address
one
other
issue.
you're
correct,
justice
scalia,
the
crime
in
this
instance
would
simply
go
unpunished.
there's
no
collateral
impact,
there's
no
collateral
method
of
punishment
within
the
prison
system
that
would
do
anything
to
the
contrary.
and
i
submit
that
single-celling
an
individual
or
putting
them
in
solitary
confinement
is
like
saying,
go
to
your
room.
and
that's
fine
for
certain
violations.
that's
not
fine
for
the
crime
of
murder.
additionally,
in
the
condition
that
our
prisons
are
in
today,
single-cell
confinement
might
be
considered
a
reward.
and
i
don't
say
that
facetiously;
it's
a
very
serious
problem
that
we
face.
one
final
point
that
i'd
like
to
make:
the
respondent
had
the
opportunity
at
habeas
corpus
proceedings
to
present
any
mitigating
circumstances,
if
they
exist.
he
did
not.
he
was
ordered
to
by
the
court;
did
not.
and
i
submit
there
simply
were
not
any.
therefore,
i
suggest
that
the
imposition
of
the
death
sentence
in
this
case,
mandatorily
imposed
by
the
nevada
statute,
on
an
inmate
serving
a
life
sentence
without
the
possibility
of
parole,
was
constitutional
and
did
not
violate
his
eighth
amendment
rights.
