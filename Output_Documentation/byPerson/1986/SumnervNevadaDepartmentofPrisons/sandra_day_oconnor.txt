justice
o'connor
mr.
mckay,
does
any
state
presently
have
such
a
law
in
effect?
justice
o'connor
do
you...
you
think
that
there
could,
in
theory,
be
some
extenuating
circumstances
in
one
of
these
cases,
for
example,
when
the
penalty...
when
the
facts
show
a
felony
murder
situation,
for
example,
where
the
individual
found
guilty
of
murder
did
not
actually
do
the
killing?
justice
o'connor
no,
i'm
talking
about
the
murder
for
which
the
defendant
is
being
tried
after
he's
previously
been
put
in
prison
for
life.
justice
o'connor
mr.
markoff,
could
you
submit
something
writing
to
this
court
to
substantiate
your
statement
here
today?
justice
o'connor
i
wonder
why
you
didn't
address
that
in
your
brief?
justice
o'connor
does
the
imposition
of
a
second
death
sentence
under
these...
a
second
sentence
of
life
without
possibility
of
parole
in
nevada
have
any
collateral
consequences
within
the
prison?
for
instance,
would
it
require
solitary
confinement
or
any
other
prison
conditions?
would
it
have
any
other
consequence
at
all?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
concede
that
if
the
ninth
circuit
is
affirmed,
that
the
death
sentence
could
be
imposed
for
this
particular
individual,
lawfully?
justice
o'connor
what
do
you
mean
by
that?
do
you
concede
that
it
would
be
lawful
to
remand
this
case
for
a
new
sentencing
proceeding,
the
results
of
which
could
be
the
imposition
of
a
death
sentence?
justice
o'connor
is
your
answer
yes
or
no?
