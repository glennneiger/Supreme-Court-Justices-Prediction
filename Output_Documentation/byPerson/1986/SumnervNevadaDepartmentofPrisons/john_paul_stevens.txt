justice
stevens
general
mckay,
you
say
a
narrowly
defined
category.
but
the
statute,
when
it
was
enacted,
didn't
limit
the
category
to
inmate
murderers,
did
it?
that
was
one
of
four
or
five
different
subcategories,
and
as
i
remember
the
statute,
it
says
at
the
end
of
it,
anybody
who
commits
any
of
these
crimes,
there
will
be
a
mandatory
death
penalty.
justice
stevens
so
the
legislature
never
singled
out
this
subcategory
and
said,
we
want
a
death
penalty
in
this
subcategory
only.
justice
stevens
and
the
nevada
legislature
has
never
reexamined
the
question
of
whether
this
subcategory
should
be
treated
differently
from
the
other
subcategories,
such
as
killing
a
police
officer?
justice
stevens
while
i've
got
you
interrupted,
can
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
in
your
view,
under
nevada
law
as
it's
now
constituted,
and
if...
say
the
court
should
affirm
the
decision
here,
could
they
have
a
second
sentencing
hearing
under
the
new
statute,
and
reimpose
the
death
penalty
on
this
particular
litigant?
justice
stevens
i
understand
that.
justice
stevens
general
mckay,
you...
in
your
presentation
you
pointed
out
that
on
collateral
review
in
nevada,
as
i
understand
it,
he
was
given
an
opportunity
to
show
mitigating
circumstances,
and
he
came
up
with
nothing.
but...
and
you
also
rely
heavily,
of
course,
on
the
'58
conviction
for
felony
murder.
but
your
view
of
the
law,
i
take
it,
is,
that
even
if
during
the
period
between
1958
and
1973
this
individual
had
a
history
of
startling
good
works,
he
just
seemed
to
be
a
completely
changed
individual,
and
then
had
a
sudden
misfortunate
in
'73...
or
maybe
not
a
misfortune...
that
would
still
all
be
totally
irrelevant?
justice
stevens
but
your
view
is
that
that's
because
you're
pretty
sure
he's
going
to
kill
in
1988.
supposing
there
was
a
lot
of
psychiatric...
all
sorts
of
expert
testimony
that
the
probability
of
this
happening
are
one
in
ten
million.
that
would
still
be
irrelevant
it
seems.
justice
stevens
you
don't
have
to
rely
on
the
killing
in
1988?
justice
stevens
you
really
don't
need
it
for
your
case,
if
you're
right.
justice
stevens
but
your
point
is,
even
if
they
don't
mean
it
the
second
time,
it
is
punishment
that's
greater
than
he
would
otherwise
suffer?
justice
stevens
and
in
support
of
that,
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
his
codefendant
in
the
'58
trial
is
actually
on
parole.
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
it's
a
rather
important
fact,
and
i'm
wondering
why
it
isn't
in
the
record.
justice
stevens
well,
is
there
any
nevada
law
of
which
we
could
take
judicial
notice
to
support
your
submission
today,
as
i
understand
it,
that
life
without
possibility
of
parole
in
nevada
does
not
really
mean
that?
are
there
any
cases
that
support
that?
how
do
we
know
that...
i
mean,
i'm
not
suggesting
you're
misrepresenting
but
how
can
we
verify
that
what
you
tell
us
is
true?
justice
stevens
--but
isn't
there
even
a
nevada
statute
that
gives
the
parole
board
the
authority
to
do
this?
or
do
they
just
shoot
from
the
hip
whenever
they
feel
like
it?
justice
stevens
but
then...
just
to
be
sure
i
understand...
the
jury
participates
only
in
capital
cases
in
the
sentencing?
justice
stevens
well,
but
that
isn't
really
the
example
here.
the
question
is
not
whether
the
jury
finds
no
punishment.
the
question
is
whether
the
warden
dealing
with
a
man
whose
been
twice
sentenced
to
life
without
possibility
of
parole
may
treat
him
differently
from
a
man
whose
only
been
given
that
sentence
once.
he
would
have
certainly
a
basis
for
differentiating
between
them,
whether
he
would
do
so,
i
don't
know.
justice
stevens
is
there
any
official
material
that
tells
us
how
often
this
sort
of
relief
is
granted
to
prisoners
under
this
sentence?
justice
stevens
are
their
decisions
officially
reported
in
any
publication?
justice
stevens
general
mckay,
do
you
serve
on
that
board.
justice
stevens
and
just
within
the
last
year,
how
many
favorable
rulings
have
you
made
in
cases
like
this?
justice
stevens
but
there
has
been
at
least
one
other
one?
justice
stevens
well
say,
take
five
years,
how
often
does
it
happen?
do
one
or
two
of
these
people
get
reduced
sentences?
justice
stevens
each
year?
justice
stevens
so
this
codefendant
is
really
quite
exceptional
when
he
got
this
relief?
justice
stevens
i
take
it
an
additional
option
would
be
to
reduce
it
something
even
further.
justice
stevens
does
that
happen
once
in
awhile?
justice
stevens
well,
let
me
put
it
this
way.
they
have
a
statutory
right
to
a
hearing
before
your
group?
justice
stevens
under
your
rules,
they
have
a
right?
justice
stevens
roughly
how
many
of
these
hearings
have
you
had
in
the
last
five
years?
justice
stevens
pardon
me?
justice
stevens
two
a
year,
i
see.
and
just
one
applicant
at
each
of
those
hearings?
justice
stevens
so
in
two
hearings
there
might
be
15
a
year,
10
or
15
people.
justice
stevens
so
over
five
years,
there
would
be
60
or
70
people
might
have
these
hearings.
and
they
are...
with
only
one
or
two
exceptions,
they've
uniformly
been
denied,
any
relief
at
all?
that's
just
in
these
life
without--
justice
stevens
--yes.
justice
stevens
i
see.
