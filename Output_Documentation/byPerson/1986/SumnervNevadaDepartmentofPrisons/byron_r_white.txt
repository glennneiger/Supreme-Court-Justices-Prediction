did
the
jury
know
that
the
penalty
was
mandatory?
justice
white
they
were
instructed
that
way?
how
do
you
know
they
knew?
justice
white
but
you
think
they
knew?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
well,
during
the
selection
of
the
jury
were
there
any
questions
about
jurors
being
opposed
to
the
death
penalty?
justice
white
thank
you.

justice

it
didn't...
it
didn't
save
this
particular
category
of
murders,
did
it?
justice

whatever
exception
there
was
in
our
cases,
saving
this...
saving
this
possibility
just
doesn't
apply
in
this
case,
because
this
isn't
a
sentence
to
life
without
parole?
justice
white
well,
the
state
has
represented
to
us
that
this
sentence
to
life
without
possibility
of
parole
was
the
very
kind
of
a
situation
that
was
saved
in
our
opinion.
and
now
you
say
this
isn't
that
situation
at
all.
justice
white
how
long
had
your
client
been
in
prison
before
he
committed
this
offense?
justice
white
and
how
about
his
codefendant?
justice
white
and
he
was
subject
to
the
identical
sentence?
justice
white
and
was
that
just
an
ordinary
parole,
or
was
it
because
of
health
or
what?
justice
white
do
you
know
of
any
other
person
who
has
ever
been
released
who
has
been
subject
to
a
sentence
like
that?

factors
should
have
been
presented
in
this
particular
case
to
the
judge?
justice
white
well,
but
i
know,
in
the
mandatory...
under
the
mandatory
statute,
the
jury
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
sentence?
justice
white
so
you're
saying
that
this
statute
must...
that
the
constitution
required
the
jury
to
do
the
sentencing?
justice
white
but
you
are...
you
don't
suggest
that
the
jury...
that
the
constitution
requires
the
jury
to
do
the
sentencing,
do
you?
justice
white
so
it
would
satisfy
your
argument,
suppose,
if
the
judge
had
the
discretion
to
consider
mitigating
circumstances?
justice
white
and
so
the
judge
would
have
had
the
discretion
not
to
impose
any
penalty
at
all?
justice
white
what
was
the...
i
guess
i
could
look
it
up...
but
what
was
the
precise
remand?
what
did
it
say?
they
couldn't
say
release
him
within
a
certain
time
unless
you
resentence
him.
justice
white
you
mean
he's
going
to
be
released
from
his
sentence
of
life
without
parole?
justice
white
how
did
this
codefendant
get
out?
justice
white
well,
why
did
the
pardon
board...
oh,
the
pardon--
justice
white
--he
was
pardoned?
he
was
pardoned?
justice
white
by
the
executive?
justice
white
i
see.
justice
white
well,
you
say
that's
all
that
could
have
happened.
well,
can't
you
find
out
for
us
what
in
fact
did
happen?
justice
white
well,
whoever
it
was.
justice
white
and
you
can
tell
us
why
he's
out?
justice
white
well,
do
the...
do
inmates,
i
suppose,
just
apply
for
a
pardon,
don't
they?
justice
white
and
do
they
get
a
hearing?
justice
white
and
do
they
have
a
right
to
a
hearing?
justice
white
so
that
it's
sort
of
like
asking
for
parole?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
if
he's
guilty,
he
certainly
isn't
going
to
have
that
right
very
long.
justice
white
and
you
don't
know,
in
the
one
or
two
times
it's
happened
since
you've
been
on
the
board,
you
don't
remember
why?
was
it
ever
just
because
he
had
a
good
record,
or
do
you
know?
