justice
scalia
what
was
the
last
thing
you
said?
he
was
not
precluded
from--
justice
scalia
--including
mitigating?
justice
scalia
what
use
would
the
mitigating
circumstances
be?
justice
scalia
you
can't
acquit
on
the
basis
of
a
mitigating
circumstance.
justice
scalia
so
i
mean,
it's
like
saying
he
could
have
sung
songs
or
something.
it
was
useless
as
far
as
his
defense
was
concerned,
right?
justice
scalia
so
it's
really
irrelevant
that
mitigating
evidence
was
allowed
in.
justice
scalia
it
was
allowed
in,
but
it
couldn't
be
used
for
anything?
justice
scalia
but
in
other
cases,
if
you
sympathize
with
the
defendant
you
can
do
something
about
it
by
recommending
a
lesser
sentence.
here,
there
was
no
option
of
a
lesser
sentence,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
that's
not
what
you
told
me
earlier,
general.
you
told
he
would
be
eligible...
you
may
not
be
able
to
do
it...
for
a
resentencing
hearing.
justice
scalia
under
nevada
law,
he
would
be
subject
to
resentencing
and
getting
the
death
penalty
again.
if
you
can
get
your...
if
you
still
have
your
evidence
and
your
witnesses
and
all
that
sort
of
thing.
justice
scalia
similar
to
the
florida
v.
dobbert
is
what
you
have?
justice
scalia
mr.
markoff?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you've
described
the
territory
accurately
as
to
what
the
situation
was,
at
least
in
1964.
we
said
in
woodson--
justice
scalia
--'64,
before
furman.
justice
scalia
i
know.
justice
scalia
i'm
about
to
read
you
what
we
said
in
woodson--
justice
scalia
--as
to
the
earlier
state
of
the
law.
the
only
category
of
mandatory
death
sentence
statutes
that
appears
to
have
had
any
relevance
to
the
actual
administration
of
the
death
penalty
in
the
years
preceding
furman
concern
the
crimes
of
murder
and
assault
with
a
deadly
weapon
by
a
life
term
prisoner.
statutes
of
this
type
apparently
existed
in
five
states
in
1964.
so
our...
you
know,
our
conclusion
that
the...
that
the...
i
forget
how
you
described
it,
a
maturing
society...
apparently
maturation
hadn't
proceeded
in
this
area
as
it
had
in
the
other
areas
with
regard
to
the
mandatory
death
penalty.
justice
scalia
mr.
markoff--
justice
scalia
--what's
distinctive
about
this
case
is,
in
all
of
our
other
cases,
we've
essentially
said
to
the
states,
you
can't
put
the
individual
to
death.
you
have
to
give
the
jury
the
option
of
considering
some
other
penalty.
what
you're
asking
us
to
say
here
is
quite
different.
that
is,
you
can't
put
the
individual
to
death.
you
have
to
give
the
jury
the
option
of
imposing
no
punishment
at
all,
right?
what
could
be
done
to
this
prisoner
who
is
in
prison
for
life
without
parole,
if
the
death
penalty
is
not
imposed?
there's
no
penalty,
right?
no
penalty
available?
justice
scalia
well,
what
would
it
be?
justice
scalia
that's
water
over
the
dam.
he
has
that
sentence
now.
what
punishment
will
be
imposed
for
incinerating
his
cellmate
or
the
individual
in
the
next
cell--
justice
scalia
--if
the
death
penalty
is
not
imposed
here?
justice
scalia
what
does
without
possibility
of
parole
mean
in
nevada
anyway?
justice
scalia
it's
not
in
your
brief
either,
is
it?
justice
scalia
well,
gee,
this
is
an
awfully
important
thing
to
drop
on
us
right
now,
isn't
it?
justice
scalia
and
you
can't
suggest
where
we
might
look
to,
you
know,
to
establish
that
without
parole
in
nevada
doesn't
mean
without
parole?
justice
scalia
have
you
been
talking
to
rex
lee
about--
justice
scalia
mr.
markoff,
now
why
don't
you
answer
my
earlier
question
on
the
assumption
that
life
imprisonment
without
parole
really
means
life
imprisonment
without
parole,
okay?
if
it
really
meant
that,
isn't
it
true
that
you're
asking
us
to
say
something
that
we've
never
said
before
in
other
cases?
in
other
cases,
we've
said,
you
have
to
allow
mitigating
circumstances,
so
that
the
jury
may,
if
it
wish,
impose
a
lesser
penalty
than
death?
but
what
you're
asking
us
to
do
is
to
adopt
a
different
principle.
you
may
allow...
you
must
allow
in
mitigating
factors
so
that
the
jury
may
if
it
wish
impose
no
penalty
whatever
for
this
murder?
justice
scalia
well,
what
penalty
could
be...
the
man
is
in
prison
for
life
without
possibility
of
parole
already,
and
you're...
you're
asserting
that
the
constitution
requires
that
the
jury
be
given
an
opportunity
to
say,
yes,
you
incinerated
the
man
in
the
cell
next
door,
but
no
penalty
whatever?
justice
scalia
oh,
you
mean
when
he
comes
back?
that's
in
the
next
life.
justice
scalia
well,
not
perhaps.
there's
no
option,
except
no
penalty
at
all,
or
another
life
without
parole
next
time
around,
right?
there's
nothing
else?
justice
scalia
well,
only
if
he
is
a
considered
a
danger.
the
warden
wouldn't
be
able
to
take
upon
himself
the
judgment
that
this
fellow
should
be
punished
more
and
put
him
into
solitary
just
to
punish
him.
wardens
don't
have--
justice
scalia
--oh,
if
he's
dangerous.
i
mean,
if
he
thinks
he's
going
to
kill
somebody
else,
and
there's
no
other
way
to
stop
him
from
doing
so
except
putting
him
into
confinement,
i
suppose.
but
you
wouldn't
say
that
if
we
sent
this
back,
and
the
jury
says,
well,
no
punishment
at
all,
that
a
warden
could
say,
i'm
going
to
send
you
to
solitary
anyway,
because
i
think
he
shouldn't
burn
somebody
without
some
punishment?
justice
scalia
--well,
you're
not
asserting
that
the
warden
has
any
authority
to
do
that?
justice
scalia
what
mitigation
did
you
introduce?
i
mean,
we're
talking
about
enough
mitigation
to
justify
no
penalty
at
all,
right?
you're
going
to
be
put
in
something
that
is
sufficiently
significant
that
it
will
induce
a
jury
to
impose
no
penalty
for
killing
somebody?
justice
scalia
it's
the
only
possibility
other
than
death.
justice
scalia
and
what
mitigating
evidence
did
you
seek
to
introduce?
justice
scalia
no,
but
he's
complaining
about
the
inability
of
the
jury
to
consider
mitigating
evidence.
what
mitigating
evidence
did
he
proffer?
justice
scalia
in
his
habeas
proceeding,
what
did
he
bring
forward?
has
he
asserted
the
existence
of
any?
i
mean,
one
of
the
points
made
by
the
state
is
that
he
hasn't
come
forward
with
any
mitigating
evidence?
justice
scalia
well,
still,
on
habeas,
you'd
expect
him
to
come
forward
and
say,
you
know,
had
i
had
the
opportunity,
what
i
would
have
said
is--
justice
scalia
--you
would
expect
him
to
point
to
some
mitigating
evidence
that
existed.
justice
scalia
that's
mitigating
evidence
on
his
part?
justice
scalia
do
you
know
that
he's
out?
