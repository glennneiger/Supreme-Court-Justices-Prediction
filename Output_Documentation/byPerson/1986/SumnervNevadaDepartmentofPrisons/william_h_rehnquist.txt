we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
no.
86-246,
george
sumner,
et
al.,
against
raymond
wallace
shuman.
general
mckay,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
to
make
the
jury
sympathize
with
the
defendant,
which
i
suppose
what
mitigating
evidence
is
used
for
in
every
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
this
was
a
single...
single
proceeding
in
which
the
issue
of
guilt
and
the
issue
of
penalty
was
determined
by
the
jury?
or
was
just
the
issue
of
guilt
determined?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
judge
says,
you
know,
the
jury
having
returned
a
verdict
of
guilty,
i
know
sentence
you
to
death.
and
he
had
no
alternative,
i
take
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
mckay.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
markoff.
chief
justice
rehnquist
xxx
that
bears
on
the
constitutional
question,
mr.
markoff.
if
they
do
that
in
response
to
decisions
such
as
woodson,
can
you
not
say
that
they're
simply
reacting
to
what
they
perceive
the
court's
constitutional
doctrine
to
be,
rather
than
this
being
the
sentiment
of
the
community?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you're
using
opinion
polls
to
prove
what?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
how
does
that
factor
into
the
constitutional
equation,
these
opinion
polls?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
how
do
the
opinion
polls
factor
into
that?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
why
i
asked
you
the
question.
do
you
cite
the
repeal
of
a
mandatory
statute
as
showing
public
opinion?
because
my
question
is,
might
it
not
just
show
what
the
legislatures
perceive
what
this
court's
constitutional
doctrine
to
require,
rather
than
independently
reflecting
public
opinion?
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
sentence
would
the
jury
impose
if
he's
retried
under
the
bifurcated
system,
if
it
doesn't
impose
the
death
penalty?
is
that
another
life
without
possibility
of
parole,
is
that's
one
of
its
choices?
but
we
meant
it?
i
mean,
is
that
what
they
would
say?
life
without
parole,
but
we
mean
it
this
time?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
how
old
was
he
in
'73?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
rehnquist
could
the
warden
put
him
in
a
fireproof
cell,
do
you
think?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
markoff.
mr.
mckay,
attorney
general
mckay,
you
have
seven
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
mckay.
the
case
is
submitted.
