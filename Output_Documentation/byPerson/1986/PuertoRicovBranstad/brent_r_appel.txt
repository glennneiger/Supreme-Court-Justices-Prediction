mr.
brent
r.
appel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
i
can
best
assist
the
court
today
with
a
three-part
presentation
about
the
extradition
clause.
first,
i
would
like
to
engage
in
a
brief
survey
of
its
history,
with
special
emphasis
on
the
constitutional
foliage
that
has
grown
up
in
the
extradition
area
in
the
absence
of
judicial
intervention.
second,
i'd
like
to
take
a
look
at
the
court
as
an
institution,
and
ask
ourselves
question:
would
it
be
preferable
for
this
court
to
intervene
and
make
extradition
decisions
rather
than
the
governors
of
the
state
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
policy?
and
then
finally,
i'd
like
to
take
a
quick
survey
of
the
facts
in
this
case,
in
which
the
state
of
iowa
has
a
fundamentally
different
presentation
to
make
than
does
puerto
rico.
first,
let's
look
briefly
at
the
history--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
read
marbury--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
read
marbury
yesterday.
and
we'll
get
back
to
it,
because
i
think
it
has
some
relevance,
justice
scalia.
the
history
of
the--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--only
a
part
of
it,
justice.
the
history
of
the
extradition
clause
is,
first,
that
the
courts
have
consistently
stayed
out
of
its
interpretation;
not
simply
the
federal
courts,
but
the
courts
of
all
50
states.
and
there's
some
8,000
state-years
of
accumulative
experience
have
stayed
out,
and
have
not
intervened
under
state
constitutions
which
deal
with
extradition
as
well.
and
as
a
result,
in
the
absence
of
this
judicial
intervention,
an
executive
common
law
tradition
of
interpreting
the
extradition
clause
of
the
constitution
and
the
state
constitutions
has
developed.
and
what
that
executive
common
law
tradition
is
basically
is
that
the...
the
extradition
clause
in
the
constitution
does
establish
a
general
principle
to
be
applied
when
states
request
that
a
fugitive
be
delivered
up.
and
the
language
is,
of
course
"shall".
just
as
the
first
amendment
says
congress
shall
pass
no
law.
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause
says,
full
faith
and
credit
shall
be
given.
and
that
has
been
recognized
by
all
the
governors.
and
extradition
occurs
on
a
routine
basis,
day-in
and
day-out.
the
question
in
this
case
is
what
happens
at
the
edges
of
the
doctrine.
every
constitutional
bone
has
cartilage
on
the
edge.
and
that's
where
we
are
in
this
case.
we're
at
the
very
edges
of
the
doctrine.
and
the
question
is,
who
decides
when
to
extradite
and
when
not
to
extradite,
and
under
what
conditions?
and
the
governors
have
come
up
with
the
following
executive
common
law
tradition.
as
i
said,
first
it's
generally
a
duty
to
extradite.
however,
where
there
is
a
serious
question
of
the
safety
of
the
individual
in
the
demanding
state,
extradition
may
be
denied.
where
there's
a
question
of--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--there's
a
smattering
of
case
law.
and
admittedly,
i
must
say,
some
of
the
case
law
is
fairly
oblique.
why?
because
the
governors'
statements
are
not
necessarily
sweeping
judicial
statements.
in
general,
it's
a
summary
executive
proceeding.
there
isn't
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law,
or
anything
like
that.
but
my
sources
on
these,
if
you
look
through
moore,
spear
and
scott,
which
are
the
key
extradition
treatises,
they
present
to
you
circumstances
in
which
states
have
declined
to
extradite.
and
if
you
look
at
south
dakota
v.
brown,
the
latest
supreme
court
case...
california
supreme
court
case...
there's
a
canvass.
my
bottom
line
point,
however,
is
that
this
executive
tradition
has
developed
over
a
hundred
years
in
interpreting...
over
200
years,
really...
in
interpreting
that
constitutional
provision.
secondly,
informal
mechanisms
of
resolution
of
extradition
disputes
have
grown
up.
there's
a
national
governors
association,
of
course.
and
there
was
reference
to
discussion
between
the
governors
of
these
states
with
respect
to
this
extradition
matter,
and
that
occurred
in
this
case.
there's
a
national
association
of
extradition
officials,
and
they
put
out
these
manuals
and
pamphlets
and
so
forth.
and
they
get
together
and
debate
and
discuss
extradition
questions.
so
there's
been...
in
the
absence
of
judicial
intervention,
which
has
been
gone
from
the
environment
for
200
years,
these
informal
mechanisms
have
grown
up.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
as
to
how
to
deal
with
the--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
our
interpretation,
of
course,
is
the
governor
has
done
his
duty;
and
that
the
governor--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--and
that's
our
interpretation
of
the
constitution,
that's
correct,
that
while--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
that's
correct,
just
like
the
first
amendment
says
congress--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
think
that
prong
of
kentucky
v.
dennison
has
been
much
chipped
away.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
am
i
saying
that
this
court
has
no
power?
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes,
i
would
say
that.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
has
no
power
under
the
constitutional
scheme,
because
that
was
not
anticipated.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
what
i'm
advocating
is
that
the
governors
have
authority
to
interpret
that
constitutional
provision.
but
the
governor
of
iowa
has
no
interest
in
harboring
fugitives,
murderers
and
all
this
kind
of
stuff
on
a
regular
basis.
the
governor
of
iowa
routinely
extradites.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
affected
by
the
facts,
yes,
exactly.
and
i
think
that
the
governor
of
iowa,
if
the
case
were
presented--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
right,
or
less.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
that's
what's
alleged
in
the
affidavits,
of
course.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
correct.
that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
we
need
to
perhaps
distinguish
between
practical
power
and
interpretation
of
the
extradition
clause.
our
view
is
that
when
the
extradition
clause
was
put
into
the
constitution,
as
it's
been
interpreted
over
the
years,
the
courts
have
said,
judicial
people
stay
out;
hands
off
kind
of
policy.
it
wasn't
designed
for
us
to
intervene.
if
you're
talking
about
power
itself,
and
does
this
court...
can
it
issue
orders
and
so
forth
and
so
on,
that's
a
different
matter.
and
let
me
make
it
very
clear:
i'm
here
to
say,
the
governor
of
iowa
of
course
is
going
to
follow
whatever
order
this
court
comes
down
with.
we're
not
challenging
in
any
kind
of
physical
way
whether
the
court
can
enforce
its
own
mandates.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
right,
right.
and--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--right.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
true.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
surely
true.
and
i
think...
i
think
much
of
that
underpinning,
in
terms
of
the
rationale
in
dennison,
has
been
undercut
today;
no
question
about
it.
but
that
doesn't
mean...
that
doesn't
necessarily
turn
the
interpretation
of
the
extradition
clause
upside
down.
in
fact,
it
was
never
contemplated
that
the
judiciary
become
intensively
involved
in
these
kind
of
extradition--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--dennison
did
say--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--dennison
did
say
that.
in
the
governor's
opinion,
that
was
dicta.
and
indeed,
this
very
court,
in
taylor
v.
taintor,
which
was
decided
in
1873,
declares...
and
i'm
just
reading
from
the
case...
where
demand
is
properly
made
by
the
governor
from
one
state,
the
duty
is
not
absolute
and
unqualified.
it
depends
on
the
circumstances
of
the
case.
and
it
goes
on
to
use
the
term
"discretion".
so
the
court
has
been
across
the
board
on
that
issue.
but
i
would
submit
to
you--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
oh,
well,
obviously
there's
no
slavery
today.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
of
course
not.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
there's
never
been
any
fact
finding
in
this
case,
justice
marshall.
that
was--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
the...
there
clearly
was
an
automobile
accident,
yes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that
was
the
allegations
in
the
affidavits
presented
in
support
of
probable
cause.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes,
there's
an
entirely--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--absolutely.
undisputable.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
undisputable.
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
the
question
of
why
was
bail
so
low,
which
is
a
good--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--that's
true,
of
course.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
quite
true,
isn't
it.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no
question
that
things
are
a
little
different
now.
but
it
seems
to
me,
as
a
matter
of
constitutional
policy,
the
courts
ought
to
stay
out
of
these
matters.
and
i'd
like
to
move
on
to
my
second--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--let
me
try
and
justify
kentucky
v.
dennison
on
other
grounds,
other
rationale,
if
i
may,
justice
scalia.
the
issue
in
this
case
is
simply
a
shifting
of
power
from
governors
to
the
judiciary.
if
the
judiciary
decides
to
administer
the
extradition
clause,
there
will
be
play
in
the
joints.
there's
no
such
thing
as
a
ministerial
constitutional
provision.
and
just
as
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
for
instance,
says,
full
faith
and
credit
shall
be
given,
the
courts
have
engaged
in
a
process
of
interpretation
of
when
that
clause
applies
and
when
it
does
not
apply.
secondly,
of
course
mandamus
doctrine
allows
for
all
kinds
of
equitable
defenses.
it's
not...
the
mandamus
is
not
granted
in
an
automatic
fashion.
that's
what
marbury
v.
madison
says
in
passing,
good
government
requires,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
and
so
what
we're
going
to
do--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
suppose...
let
me
give
you
a
fact
hypothetical.
supposing
there
was
a
lynch...
lynch
mob
mentality
in
a
jurisdiction.
and
there
mobs
in
puerto
rico,
if
i
get
back
to
the
record,
from
our
perspective.
supposing
the
governor
had
good
evidence
that
this
person
gets
extradited,
and
there's
going
to
be
a
lynching.
or
there's
a
serious
question
of
the
physical
safety
of
someone.
under
the
extradition
clause,
must
a
governor,
simply
by
looking
at
the
affidavits
on
its
face,
and
the
fact
that
he's
a
fugitive,
must
a
governor
in
all
instance
extradite?
answer:
i
don't
think
so.
and
i
don't
think
this--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
suspect
so,
and
it
might
happen
again
in
the
future,
unfortunately.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no,
extradition
should
not
have
been
granted
in
those
instances.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
a
number
of
governors
declined
to
extradite
on
just
those
facts.
it's
our
footnote
7,
the
pennsylvania
case.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
there's
a
case
out
of
pennsylvania,
yes,
there
is
where
a
governor...
a
judge,
actually,
a
court,
declined
to
extradite
under
those
circumstances.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
i'm
sorry.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
oh,
it
is
not.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
if
we
look
at
the
way
the
shape...
the
way
this
case
is
framed.
it's
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
mandamus.
and
it
characterizes
the
duty
under
the
extradition
clause
as
ministerial,
and
then
says
that
the
governor
looked
at
materials
outside
the
sufficiency
of
the
affidavits
accompanying
the
warrant
and
the
fact
that
he's
a
fugitive.
no
factual
dispute
on
that.
the
governor
did
consider
material
outside
the
scope
of
the
stack
of
papers.
no
question
about
it.
and
what
puerto
rico
has
said
is,
bzzz,
that's
illegal
right
there.
mandamus,
you
cannot
consider
matters
outside
the
question
of
whether
or
not
he's
substantially
charged
and
whether
he's
a
fugitive.
our
position
is,
oh,
yes,
yes,
because
of
this
executive
common
law
tradition,
you
can
consider
the
safety
of
the
individual.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
right.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
it
would
be
remanded
back
to
the
district
court
for
appropriate
proceedings.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
we
haven't
had
any
development
of
it--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--because
we
relied
on
kentucky
v.
dennison,
and
the
motion
to
dismiss
and
all
this.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
think
it
would
be
very
difficult
to
bring
a
1983
action
and
obtain
a
compulsive
remedy
of
getting
ahold
of
the
individual.
but
i
do
want
to
speak
to
alternative
remedies.
first,
the
congress
of
the
united
states
has
acted
in
this
extradition
area.
it
has
not
passed
a
mandamus
statute
authorizing
district
courts
or
this
court
to
issue
writs
of
mandamus
for
fugitives.
it's
passed
a
mandamus
statute,
you're
all
familiar
with
it,
1361,
which
authorizes
mandamus
against
federal
officials;
and
there's
been
much
litigation
about
that
in
the
heckler
case
and
so
forth.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
of
course.
of
course,
that's
right.
but
you
see,
that's
the
catch-22
situation.
it's
the
fact
that
this
doctrine
has
been
historically
established,
and
this
constitutional
vegetation
has
grown
up.
and
puerto
rico's
argument
is
really
a
constitutionally
violent
one
in
the
sense
that
it
strips
away
all
these
informal
mechanisms,
and
strips
away
the
fugitive
felon
act,
which
is
congress'
method
of
approaching
the
problem.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
we're
not
ignoring
the
constitutional--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--no,
no.
no,
the
question
then
is
what
is
the
constitutional
command.
i
mean,
it's
like
a
first
amendment
argument
saying,
well,
you
know,
the
first
amendment
says,
congress
shall
pass
no
law.
and
then
we
say,
fire
in
the
theater,
and
we
pass
a
congressional
regulation
saying
you
can't
do
that.
it's
a
question
of
substance.
and
i
don't
think
there's
such
a
thing
as
a
ministerial
constitutional
duty.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
surely.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
suspect--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--a
couple
of
difficulties,
i
think.
first,
the
governors
have
access
to
all
kinds
of
informal
channels
of
communications
that
may
not
be
available
to
a
sitting
federal
judge.
they
get
on
the
phone,
they
call
the
other
governors.
they
have
frank
and
candid
discussions
about
it.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
but
of
course,
the
reaction,
if
that
were
the
law
that
the
federal
courts
were
going
to
be
involved,
is,
the
governors
are
just
going
to
more
or
less
hand
the
issues
over
to
them.
i
think
we
want
to
encourage
this
informal
method
of
discussion
that
we
have.
secondly--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--surely
true.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
surely
true.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no.
the
only...
the
questions
in
this
case
really
are...
in
fact
the
governor's
interpretation
of
the
extradition
clause
i
don't
think
is
fundamentally
very
much
different
than
what
frankly
the
members
of
the
court
are
likely
to
come
up
with,
though
on
the
margins
apparently
there's
some
question.
the
governor
believes
that
he
can
go
beyond
the
affidavits
to
look
at
the
safety
of
the
individual
and
issues
of
fairness
and
so
forth.
that's
what
the
governor
believes
as
part
of
the
constitutional
provision.
the
question
is,
who
administers,
more
than
anything.
i'd
also
like
to
point
out
if
i
may--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--the
question
is,
who
shall
have
the--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
indeed,
i
think
if
the
court
becomes
involved,
the
court
of
course
will
have
the
final
say.
and
it
may--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
i'm
not
sure
of
that.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
let
me
ask
this:
supposing...
supposing
again,
and
i'm
posing--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--yes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no,
i
don't
think
so.
it's
like,
for
instance,
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause,
for
example,
let's
use
that
analogy.
in
the
full
faith
and
credit
context,
in
the...
in
the
so-called
foreign
state,
you
can
challenge
that
foreign
decree
on
the
basis
that
were
no
jurisdictions,
there
was
no
due
process,
a
number
of
other
things.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
don't
read
that
in
the
constitution,
quite
frankly.
i
mean,
that's
like
saying...
look
at
the
full
faith
and
credit
clause.
talk
about
sweeping.
it
says,
full
faith
and
credit
shall
be
given
to
each...
blah-blah-blah...
for
all
acts,
et
cetera,
et
cetera,
et
cetera.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
justice
scalia,
that's
not
entirely
true.
for
instance,
in
the
antelope
case,
for
instance,
back
in
justice
marshall's
day,
it
was
held
that
penal
provisions
aren't
enforceable
under
full
faith
and
credit.
it
was
also--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--right,
but
i
think
we're--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
understand
that.
but
i
think
you're
assuming
the
question
of
the
scope
of
the
clause.
it's
like
a...
it's
like
a
first
amendment
type
setting
once
again.
we
understand
that
the
general
obligation,
as
is
the
general
obligation
under
the
first
amendment,
is
that--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
and
i
just
don't...
i
must
say,
i
don't--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
think
that
is
not
correct.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
no,
the
probable
cause,
we
have
stipulated
that
there
was,
on
the
face
of
the
affidavits--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--if
the
court
becomes
involved,
i
assume
he
could.
i
assume
he
could.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
oh,
sure.
right,
michigan
v.
dorn.
but
what
did
you
hold
in
that
regard?
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
as
the
justice
well
knows,
you
held
that
a
court...
a
court...
would
not
look
beyond--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--when
the
governor
has
decided
to
extradite,
precisely.
there's
a
whole
host
of
cases--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--yes,
of
course.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
excuse
me,
i'm
going
to
back
off
that.
i
think
that's
not
correct.
but...
i
know
when
i'm
out
on
a
limb,
and
that's
one.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
but
i
want
to
come
back
to
the
basic
constitutional
point,
and
that
is,
again,
this
business
frankly,
about
is
his
duty
mandatory
or
is
ministerial,
this
is
not
a
helpful
distinction.
there's
no
question
that
the...
that
the
extradition
clause
in
general
establishes
a
norm
of
constitutional
conduct,
just
as
full
faith
and
credit
does,
and
just
as
the
first
amendment
does.
and
once
again,
the
question
is,
what
do
we
do
at
the
margins?
and
i
might
add...
let's
look
at
this
article
iv;
i
think
it's
kind
of
interest.
full
faith
and
credit,
et
cetera.
congress
shall
provide
how
the
record
shall
be
proved,
and
the
effect
thereof.
congress
is
expressly
authorized
to
prove
the
effect
thereof
of
full
faith
and
credit,
and
it
has
under
1738--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--but
if
we
look
under--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--yes,
i
think
that's
probably
true.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes,
but
the
point--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
i'm
trying
to
argue
by
analogy,
to
make
two
points,
justice.
one
is,
just
the
provision
says
"shall"
doesn't
mean
that
it
answers
all
our
questions.
and
secondly,
congress
is
given
express
authority
to
determine
the
effect
thereof
on
the
full
faith
and
credit.
we
move
down,
then,
to
the
extradition
clause,
and
we
don't
have
such
language.
indeed,
the
framers
no
doubt
thought
that
the
states
in
their
own...
that
each
state's
governor
would
determine
how
to
interpret
that
extradition
clause.
there's
no
further...
say,
congress
shall
give
effect,
et
cetera.
in
closing,
i
do
want
to
go...
raise--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--well,
i
think
there
is.
and
the
reason
for
that
is,
again,
the
constitutional
history
of
judicial
nonintervention
that's
grown
up.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
suspect
i
could.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
wanted
to
address
your
concern
about
the
power
under
the
territories
clause,
and
that
we
could
conceivably
put
aside
article
iv,
the
extradition
clause,
and
go
under
the
territory
clause,
right.
first,
that
hasn't
been
raised
in
this
proceeding.
indeed,
it's
not
in
the
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari.
the
petition
is
only
based
on
article
iv.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
puerto
rico
is
seeking
for
an
opinion
of
this
court
to
declare
that
it's
a
state.
there's
an
ideological
interest
at
stake
here,
i
think.
they
haven't
raised
the
claim.
but
let
me
address
the
claim--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i
think
not.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
and
the
reason
for
that
is
that,
your
honor,
the
tenth
amendment,
all
rights
are
reserved
to
the
states.
the
extradition
clause
plainly
says,
when
a
sister
state
requests
it,
you
know,
that's
cut
into.
but
i
think
if
congress
attempted
to
pass
such
a
statute,
it
wouldn't
pass
constitutional
muster.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
that's
right.
and
that
can
be
done
under
the
fugitive
felon
act,
which
allows...
someone
who
flees
from
one
state
to
another
is
guilty
of
a
federal
crime,
if
the
attorney
general
authorizes
prosecution.
you
can
see
that
congress
has
been
very
chary
about
getting
into
this
field.
by
passing
the
fugitive
felon
act,
which
says
it's
a
federal
crime
to
jump
from
one
state
to
another,
and
a
federal
prosecution
can
be
brought
with
the
approval
of
the
attorney
general
or
the
assistant
attorney
general,
which
may
not
be
delegated.
and
so
there's
no
serious
threat
of
a
constitutional
breakdown
occurring
in
this
case
at
all.
the
system
has
worked
well.
if
it
ain't
broke,
don't
fix
it,
is
part
of
our
argument.
it's
hard
to
see
how
the
injection
of
the
judiciary
into
the
environment
is
going
to
help
improve
things.
in
closing...
this
is
my
second
closing...
i'd
like
to
briefly
go
through
some
of
the
facts
that
were
stated.
the
question
about
bond
being
so
low:
one
of
the
reasons
is,
they
were
afraid
that
this
person
if
incarcerated
in
puerto
rico
would
be
killed;
and
that
appears
in
the
appendix
as
part
of
the
extradition
proceeding.
there
was
a
serious
concern
about
the
safety
of
this
individual.
i
want...
i
want
to
stress,
justices,
this
was
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
and
a
petition
for
writ
of
mandamus,
and
there
hasn't
been
a
factual
development
in
a
traditional
sense
down
below.
these
are
materials
that
were
before
the
governor.
but
i
just
want
to
share
with
you
some
of
the
concerns
that
were
motivating
governor
branstad,
who
normally
extradites,
of
course.
there
was
serious
concern
about
the
safety
of
the
individual;
fear
that
he'd
be
killed.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
i
understand
that.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
yes.
yes,
i'd
have
to.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
well,
i
think...
no...
the
basic
construct
is
this,
what
is
the
substance
of
the
extradition
clause?
it
vests
administrative
authority
in
the
governor
to
decide
whether
or
not
that
general
duty
applies.
and
on
the
margins,
the
governors
determine
what
the
exceptions
are.
and
in
the
course
of
this
150
years,
there's
been
kind
of
a
common
law
type
evolution,
documented
perhaps
kind
of
illy
because
there
haven't
been
that
many
litigated
cases.
but
the
governors
have
developed
a
number
of
exceptions,
just
like
exceptions
have
been
developed
to
full
faith
and
credit,
and
just
like
exceptions
have
been
developed--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--i'm
here
at
his
instructions.
i
think
there's
some
ambivalence
about
extradition
to
be
sure
among
the
governors.
that's
just
my
speculation;
i
haven't
taken
any
poll.
but
again,
we
have
to
wonder,
how
will
the
best
institutional
results
be
fashioned
here?
it
seems
to
me
that--
mr.
brent
r.
appel
--obviously,
it's
not
just
like
europe.
mr.
brent
r.
appel
my
red
light's
on,
but
to
answer:
what
is
the
purpose
of
this
extradition
clause?
what
is
has
done,
and
no
one
can
dispute
this
fact,
what
the
extradition
clause
has
done
is
ensured
that
each
governor
has
authority
to
extradite
a
person
to
a
sister
state;
and
no
one
can
go
into
federal
habeas
corpus
or
state
habeas
corpus
and
say,
look,
no
authority;
you
can't
do
it.
and
the
extradition
clause
has
made
that
absolutely,
crystal,
perfectly
clear,
and
no
court
has
held
otherwise;
just
as
they've
also
held
that
no
courts
should
coerce
a
governor.
