well,
mr.
appel,
what
about
cases
like
ex
parte
young?
do
they
have
any
relevance,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
question
is
just
whether
that
aspect
of
dennison
is
valid
today.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
grew
up
a
long
time
ago
in
different
circumstances.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
court
has
gone
a
long
way
since
then--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--in
saying
that
federal
courts
generally
have
power
to
enforce--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
didn't
dennison
say
that
there
was
an
absolute
duty,
a
ministerial
duty,
on
the
part
of
the
governor
to
comply
with
the
extradition
request?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
i
read
it
as
turning
only
on
the
question
of
whether
federal
courts
had
the
power
to
enforce
the
ministerial
duty.
