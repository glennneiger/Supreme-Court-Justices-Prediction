chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-2116,
puerto
rico
again
branstad.
mr.
saldana,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
agree,
mr.
saldana,
don't
you,
that
we
would
have
to
overrule
kentucky
against
dennison
to
rule
in
your
favor
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that
statute
was
in
effect
at
the
time
kentucky
against
dennison
was
decided,
wasn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
you
were
referring
to
the
statute
of
1793.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
that
statute
was
in
effect
at
the
time
that
kentucky
v.
dennison
was
decided.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
saldana.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
appel.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
source...
how
can
you
tell
what
this
common
law
tradition
is?
are
there
governors'
statements
and
that
sort
of
thing?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
why
is
mandamus
the
only
conceivable
remedy
for
the
demanding
state
if
kentucky
v.
dennison
were
to
be
overruled?
i
mean,
couldn't
you
just
bring
an
ordinary
1983
action
against
the
governor?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
the
governor
has
decided
to
extradite.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
appel.
your
time
has
expired.
the
case
is
submitted.
