mr.
saldana,
not
that
it
matters,
but
what
position
do
you
hold
in
the
government
of
puerto
rico?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
i
notice
on
the
brief
that
everybody
has
a
title
but
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
i
was
just
wondering,
you're
authorized
to
speak
for
the
government?
justice
thurgood
marshall
thank
you.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
what
you're
asking
for?
a
haven
for
any
criminal
from
iowa.
any
criminal
charged
with
a
serious...
all
he
has
to
do
is
run
to
puerto
rico.
is
that
what
you're
advocating?
justice
thurgood
marshall
he
thinks
this
is
a
manslaughter
case.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
when
you
drive
over
a
pregnant
woman
three
or
four
times,
that's
manslaughter?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
that's
all
you
have
to
go
on.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
all
you
have
to
go
on
under
the
extradition
act.
well,
again,
i'd
like
to
know,
you
think
the
governor,
anytime
he
wants
to,
can
refuse
extradition,
and
that
he
may
not
be
ordered
to
extradite
by
a
federal
court?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
if
you're
going
to
defend
on
the
case,
the
dennison
case
involved
the
slave
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
which
you
agree
that
doesn't
apply
today.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
hope
you
do.
i
don't
want
to
get
down
off
the
bench.
justice
thurgood
marshall
getting
back
to
my
other
point,
the
state
of
iowa
says,
calder
has
been
charged
by
puerto
rican
authorities
with
murder
in
connection
with
an
automobile
accident.
do
you
agree
with
that?
that
is
was
just
an
automobile
accident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
do
you
agree
that
it
was
just
an
automobile
accident?
justice
thurgood
marshall
automobile
accident,
when
you
deliberately
run
over
somebody?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
there
anything
to
disprove
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
the
woman
dead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
the
baby's
dead?
justice
thurgood
marshall
in
the
'20s
and
'30s,
i
can
give
you
thousand
cases
where
that
was
just
what
happened.
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
that
all
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
oh,
we
should
have
left
them
up
there.
well,
it's
a
little--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--a
case?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
you
said
the
governor.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
right.
i
know
you're
wrong.
i
had
a
few
of
those
cases.
suppose
we
overturned
kentucky
and
said,
yes,
governors
may
be
ordered
to
do
their
duty
under
the
extradition
clause.
i
take
it
you
don't
think
the
case
is
over
even
then?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx
on
the
face
of
the
document.
well,
then
the
provision
of
the
constitution
really
doesn't
do
anything
at
all.
if
your
answer
to
that
is--
justice
thurgood
marshall
if
full
faith
and
credit
applied,
you
wouldn't
need
the
extradition
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
would
you?
if
full
faith
and
credit
applied,
you
wouldn't
need
the
extradition
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
we
have
the
extradition
act.
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
obviously,
full
faith
and
credit
didn't
apply.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
are
you
arguing
full
faith
and
credit?
