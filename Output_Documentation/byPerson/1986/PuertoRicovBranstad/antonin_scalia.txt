justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
saldana,
why
is
that...
why
is
that
so?
that
is
so
only
if
you
insist
that
puerto
rico
is
a
state
within
the
meaning
of
the
provision
here.
you
have
a
statute
that
purports
to
require
extradition
to
either
a
state,
a
district
or
a
territory.
might
now
the
power
of
the
united
states
be
different
insofar
as
its
ability
is
concerned
to
require
a
state
to
extradite
to
a
territory,
than
it
is
with
regard
to
its
power
to
require
a
state
to
extradite
to
another
state?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
this
statute,
insofar
as
it
might
apply
to
puerto
rico,
is
not
an
implementation
of
the
extradition
clause
of
the
constitution
but
is
an
implementation
of
congress'
power
to
govern
territories.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
it
should
be
written
that
way,
but
why
should
it
be
read
that
way
if
it
wasn't
written
that
way?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
be,
but
not
because
puerto
rico
is
a
state,
but
because
in
order
to
interpret
the
statute
as
being
mandatory,
since
it
applies
to
both
states
and
territories,
you
would
have
to
contravene
kentucky
v.
dennison,
whether
or
not
puerto
rico
is
a
state.
i
mean,
i'm
quite...
it's
an
uphill
battle
to
convince
me
that
when
the
constitution
refers
to
states,
and
says
states,
and
elsewhere
it
refers
to
territory,
it
makes
no
difference
between
the
two.
so
it
seems
to
me
that
if
puerto
rico
comes
under
this
statute,
it
comes
under
it
as
a
territory,
not
as
a
state,
which--
justice
antonin
scalia
--i'm
not
anxious
reach
the
constitutional
question.
i
mean,
i
would
as
soon
avoid
it.
but
it
may
well
be
that
you
can't
read
the
statute
the
way
you
want
to
read
it,
or
you
couldn't
read
it
to
be
mandatory
for
territories
and
permissive
for
states,
because
it
doesn't
purport
to
distinguish
between
the
two.
but
i
hope
you
will
tell
me
we
don't
have
to
reach
it
because
puerto
rico
is
a
state,
because
i
don't
think
you
will
persuade
me
that
puerto
rico
is
a
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
probably
how
marbury
v.
madison
was
argued,
too.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
lost
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
kentucky
v.
dennison,
by
the
way,
not
only
involved
a
fugitive
slave
problem,
but
also
in
1860,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
at
a
time
when,
if
we
had
said
we
had
had
the
power
to
compel
it
by
the
states,
it's
not
at
all
clear
that
the
states
wouldn't
have
laughed
at
us,
right,
until
after
the
civil
war.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
think
that
maybe
things
are
a
little
different
now,
and
we
should
reconsider
whether
that
case
was
unduly
influenced
by
the
times
in
which
it
was
decided?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i'm
suggesting
that
the
policy
was
a
very
pragmatic
one;
that
the
times
were
such
that
the
court
might
not
have
thought
it
could
have
made
a
different
decision
stick.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
those
defenses
would
not
pertain
to
whether
indeed
it
was
just
an
automobile
accident
or
an
attempt...
or
a
murder.
and
they
wouldn't
pertain
to
whether
there
is
a
good
system
of
justice
in
the
state
to
which
the
individual
is
sought
to
be...
they
would
pertain
to
quite
different
factors
that
the
governors
usually
don't
worry
about.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
that
sometimes
the
governors'
determinations
about
whether
to
extradite
a
particular
individual
may
be
affected
by
what
kind
of
press
coverage
the
case
has
gotten?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
how
he
thinks
he'll
fare
in
the
next
election
if
he
should
extradite
this
individual?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
that
problem
is
eliminated
by
having
the...
if
indeed
there
are
mandamus
discretionary
equitable
kinds
of
considerations
that
should
be
taken
into
account,
wouldn't
they
better
be
taken
into
account
by
a
life-tenured
federal
judge
on
a
mandamus
action,
who
doesn't
have
to
worry
about
what
the
electorate
would
do
the
next
time
around?
justice
antonin
scalia
they
can
oppose
the
extradition
if
they
want.
they
can
come
into
the
court,
i
assume,
and
provide
whatever
information
those
informal
channels
would
yield.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
have
now
with
respect
to
the
fugitive
slave
provision
that
congress
has
authority
to
implement.
there's
no
reason
to
think
as
far
as
the
implementation
power
is
concerned,
the
one
is
different
from
the
other,
is
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes,
to
be
sure.
i
mean
you
can
answer
that...
you
can
answer
all
my
questions
that
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
just
citing
kentucky
v.
dennison.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
you
think
there
might
be
some
problem?
let's
assume
we
were
talking
about
a
territory
in
which
congress
had
not
even
established
any
local
courts;
it
was
governing
it
by
federal
courts,
all
right?
could
congress
require
a
state
to
hunt
down
a...
a
state
to
hunt
down
a
fugitive
from
an
indicted
crime
in
that
territory?
justice
antonin
scalia
yeah,
that's
the
problem
i
have.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
say,
congress'
remedy
is,
if
it's
a
federal
offense
in
a
federal
territory,
use
your
own
police
to
do
it;
you
can't
lay
that
burden
on
the
states.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
think
they
really
like
to
do
that?
it
is
curious
that
no
other
states
have
come
in
on
either
side
of
this
thing.
i
really
wonder
whether
governors
like
to
have
to
worry
about
this
stuff;
whether
they
wouldn't
be
delighted
to
have
these
questions
about
whether
somebody's
going
to
be
hung
if
he
goes
somewhere
else,
worried
about
by
courts.
it
seems
like
a
strange
thing
for
the
governor
of
iowa
or
anywhere
else
to
be
worrying
about.
are
you
sure
you're
doing
your
governor
a
favor?
