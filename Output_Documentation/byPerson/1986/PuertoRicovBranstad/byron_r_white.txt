justice
byron
r.
white
well,
mr.
saldana,
the
state
of
iowa
in
its
brief
suggests,
as
a
last
argument,
that
puerto
rico
isn't
entitled
to
use
the
clause
or
the
statute
at
all,
because
you
aren't
a
state;
that
you're
a
territory.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
it's...
puerto
rico
is
a
state?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
just
any
territory
of
the
united
states
could
employ
the
extradition
clause?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
didn't
need
to
interpret
that
clause
to
pass
that
statute.
but
it
did;
it
said
any
state
or
territory,
the
extradition
statute
does.
and
so
you
may
claim
protection
of
the
statute,
may
you
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
we...
if
we
interpreted
the
statute
differently
than
the
dennison
case
did,
we
wouldn't
have
to
reach
any
constitutional
issue
at
all.
justice
byron
r.
white
except
it's
got
the
word
"territory"
in
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
isn't
there
some
indication
in
the
dennison
case
that
the
court
actually
thought
the
statute
imposed
a
duty,
but
only
a
moral
duty.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
that
it
wasn't
an
enforceable
duty,
and
wasn't
intended
to
be
enforceable.
isn't
that
what
the
court
said?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that's
a
construction
of
a
federal
statute.
justice
byron
r.
white
why?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
if
there
were
no
extradition
clause
at
all?
do
you
think
congress
could
have
passed
the
extradition
statute?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
needn't
perform
what
otherwise
would
be
his
duty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
what
it
amounts
to
in
this
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
needn't
carry...
he
needn't
extradite.
justice
byron
r.
white
sometimes
he
has
to
and
sometimes
he
doesn't?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
are
you
defending
the
judgment
that...
are
you
defending
kentucky,
the
kentucky
case,
that
there
is
no
power
to
make
a
government
extradite?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
how
about
my
question?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
has
no
power
to
order
a
governor?
justice
byron
r.
white
because?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
so
the
case
wouldn't
be
over.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
case
would
be
over
in
this
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
those
issues,
if
you've
got
them,
would
be
open
in
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
it
didn't
sound
very
much
like
the
lower
court
would
be
too
sympathetic
with
your
position.
but
they
may
be.
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
that
your
governor
could
relitigate
the
question
of
probable
cause
to
arrest
in
this
state?
and
he'd
say,
well--
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
that
isn't
what
i
was
asking
you.
what
if
the
governor
said,
you
know,
i
just
don't
believe
there
was
probable
cause
to
arrest
this
fellow
in
puerto
rico.
they
just
don't
have
the
facts
there,
despite
this
warrant
and
despite
these
affidavits.
now,
can
he
relitigate
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
have
we
held
in
that
regard?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
did
we
hold?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
think
the
governor
could
decide
not
to
extradite
because
he
didn't
think
there
was
probable
cause.
justice
byron
r.
white
--a
weak
limb,
too.
