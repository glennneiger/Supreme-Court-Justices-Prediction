mr.
lino
j.
saldana
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
petitioner
in
this
case
requested
extradition
of
mr.
ronald
calder,
who
was
charged
with
murder
and
attempted
murder,
and
is
a
fugitive
from
the
courts
of
justice
in
the
courts
of
puerto
rico,
and
had
fled
to
iowa.
the
governor
of
iowa
denied
extradition.
the
commonwealth
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
for
the
southern
district
of
iowa
seeking
a
writ
of
mandamus
directing
the
governor
to
extradite
calder.
the
writ
was
refused.
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
the
case
is
here
on
certiorari.
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
federal
courts
have
power
to
order
the
governor
of
a
state
to
extradite
a
fugitive
from
justice
in
the
courts
of
puerto
rico
who
has
been
accused
of
murder
and
attempted
murder.
there
is
no
dispute
in
this
case
that
the
extradition
request
made
by
puerto
rico
fully
complies
with
all
statutory
and
constitutional
requirements.
there
is
no
dispute,
either,
that
the
duty
of
the
governor
of
iowa
to
extradite
mr.
calder
is
an
absolute
duty,
both
mandatory
and
ministerial,
under
the
constitution
and
the
statute.
all
that
is
at
issue
here
is
whether
the
court,
the
federal
court,
may
command
the
governor
to
obey
that
duty,
or
whether
the
governor
may
violate
it
with
impunity.
now
the
facts
are
as
follows.
mr.
ronald
calder
on...
in
1981
drover
his
car
into
a
married
couple
in
a
parking
lot
of
a
grocery
store
in
puerto
rico.
the
husband
was
injured
but
survived.
his
pregnant
wife
was
killed,
as
well
as
her
unborn
child.
the
justice...
a
judge,
i'm
sorry,
of
the
superior
court
of
puerto
rico,
after
a
preliminary
hearing,
found
probable
cause
to
charge
calder
with
murder
and
attempted
murder.
this
was
done
after
a
hearing,
as
i
said,
in
which
the
judge
heard
testimony
from
sworn
witnesses,
and
in
which
calder
was
represented
by
counsel.
the
witnesses,
the
eyewitnesses,
told
the
judge
that
calder
had
deliberately
run
his
car
over...
drove
his
car
into
the
couple,
attempted
to
run
down
the
couple
with
his
car,
and
that
after
the
wife
was
down,
he
repeatedly
run
over
the
body,
her
body,
with
his
car.
mr.
calder
was
freed
on
bail
after
the
district
attorney
filed
informations
against
him
for
these
two
alleged
crimes,
and
he
failed
to
appear
at
two
successive
hearings
in
the
criminal
case.
and
the
court...
another
judge
in
the
district...
in
the
superior
court
ordered
him
to
be
arrested,
issued
a
warrant
of
arrest,
after
declaring
him
a
fugitive.
he
was
found
in
iowa,
his
native
state,
and
there
a
request
was
made
to
the
governor
of
iowa
that
calder
be
extradited.
the
request
of
the
governor
of
puerto
rico
was...
fully
complied
with
all
the
requirements,
both
statutory
and
constitutional.
in
spite
of
that,
an
extradition
hearing
was
held.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
iowa
was
his
home,
yes,
sir.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
in
puerto
rico,
you
mean,
sir?
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
he
was
first
charged
with
manslaughter,
and
a
small
bond
was
requested
from
him.
apparently,
what
the
court
felt
was
that
there
was
no
danger
that
he
would
not
appear.
and
he
was
working
in
puerto
rico
as
an
air
controller.
and
only
$5,000
bond
was
required
from
him.
that's
about
all
the
explanation
i
can
give
your
honor
to
that.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes,
it
is.
the
governor
of
iowa
in
the...
on
the
basis
of
the
extradition
hearing,
denied
the
request
for
extradition.
at
the
hearing,
evidence
was
admitted
to...
by
the
declarations
and
testimony
of
calder,
of
calder's
companion
at
the
scene
of
the
crime,
of
the
alleged
crimes,
and
of
calder's
attorneys,
to
the
fact
that
the
puerto
rico
courts
were
unable
to
administer
properly
justice
in
this
case,
in
calder's
case.
calder
and
his
other
two
witnesses
stated
that
there
was
a
prejudice
against
white
american
men
like
calder,
and
that,
under
those
circumstances,
the
trial--
they
also
brought
hearsay
evidence
to
the
effect
that
witnesses
had
been
bought...
bought
off
in
puerto
rico
in
some
cases,
and
they
attacked
in
that
way
the
integrity
and
the
quality
of
the
justice
of...
that
is
afforded
by
the
puerto
rico
courts.
now,
the
governor
of
iowa
tried
to
intercede
on
calder's
behalf
in
some
plea
bargaining
between
calder's
attorneys
and
the
puerto
rico
prosecutors.
they
were
bargaining
on
whether
to
accept
a
plea
of
guilty
from
calder
on
a
lesser
charge,
and
also,
whether
a
sentence
of
probation
would
be
imposed.
the
prosecutors
conditioned
all
plea
bargaining
upon
calder's
voluntary
return
to
puerto
rico.
and
the
governor
then
tried
to
intercede
and
had
some
talks
with
governor
romero
of
puerto
rico.
these
talks
failed,
and
thereon,
the
governor
of
iowa
denied
extradition.
the
commonwealth
filed
a
complaint
in
the
district
court
seeking
a
writ
of
mandamus
against
the
governor
of
iowa
to
order
him
to
extradite
calder.
the
court
refused
to
issue
the
writ.
it
held
that
it
was
bound
by
the
decision
of
this
court
in
dennison...
in
kentucky
v.
dennison;
that
the
federal
court
had
now
power
to
order
the
state
governor
to
extradite
calder.
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit
affirmed
that
judgment
reluctantly,
stating
that
the
reasoning
and
the
underpinnings
of
the
dennison
case
had
been
undermined,
had
been
eroded
to
such
a
degree
that
the
court...
the
only
court
empowered
to
do
so,
the
supreme
court,
should
reconsider
it.
now--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--yes,
sir.
now,
the--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--well,
the
power
of
congress
to
enact
the
extradition
act
is
based
on
the
implied
power
of
congress
to
implement
the
extradition
clause.
and
the--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--well,
that
power
cannot
justify
the
congress
ordering
a
state
to
extradite
a
fugitive
to
a
territory.
it
would
operate
for
congress
to
direct
a
territory
to
extradite
to
a
state,
or
to
extradite
to
another
territory.
but
the
power
of
congress
to
implement
the
clause
as
it
did,
ordering
a
state
to
extradite
a
fugitive
to
a
territory,
must
rest
on
something
other
than
the
territorial
power.
it
rests
on
the
implied
power
of
congress,
under
the
very...
under
the
extradition
clause
itself,
to
implement
that
statute.
and
for...
history
reveals
that
the
extradition
statute
was
approved
in
1793
a
few
years
after
the
constitution
was
ratified;
and
the
people
and
the
congressmen
who
were
there
were,
many
of
them
were
members
of
the
convention,
lawyers
and
framers
of
the
constitution,
who
had
at
least
drafted
the
constitution
and
participated
in
the
process
of
ratification.
now
it
has
long
been
considered...
it
is
really
beyond
question...
that
this
contemporary
interpretation
of
congress,
of
the
meaning
of
the
extradition
clause,
is
valid,
and
that
it
shows
that
congress,
in
the
extradition...
that
the
extradition
clause
of
the
constitution
goes
beyond
states,
beyond
the
13
states
of
the
union;
that
it
includes
other
entities
like
territories,
like
the
commonwealth,
like
the
district
of
columbia.
now
we
may
not
have...
it
may
not
be
necessary
to
decide
that
question,
because
the
statute,
as
justice
scalia
points
out,
imposes
the
duty
of
extradition
upon
the
iowa
state
governor.
there
is
no
problem,
no
doubt,
that
it
is
a
valid
statute.
and
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
applies
to
puerto
rico.
before
1952,
this
court
so
expressly
held.
and
after
1952,
it
is
also
clear
that
the
extradition
act
was
undisturbed
in
its
application
to
puerto
rico.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
hear
you.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
that's
right,
sir.
and
the
dennison
decision
interprets
both
the
constitution
and
the
statute.
and
it
did
interpret
both
together
because
the
statute
and
the
constitution
are
coterminous.
they
speak
in
the
same
language.
they
use
the
same
words.
they
must
be
read
in
pari
materia.
and
it
is
impossible
for
this
court
to
decide
the
statutory
issue
without
reaching
the
constitutional
issue.
so
both...
they
are
inseparable.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
i
am
special
counsel
in
this
case.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
that's
right.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
we
feel
that
no
case,
or
few
cases
at
least,
would
better
demonstrate
that
dennison
should
be
overruled
that
this,
the
present
one.
first,
the
dennison
decision
leaves
the
governor
free
to
violate
with
impunity
his
duty
to
extradite,
the
duty
that
is
imposed
both
by
the
constitution
and
by
the
statute.
ronald
calder
has
been
able
to
find
precisely
what
the
extradition
clause
and
the
extradition
statute
intended
to
prevent.
he
has
found
an
asylum,
a
free
asylum,
in
iowa.
and
he
has
been
able
to
avoid
altogether
responding
for
his
alleged
crimes.
he
has
obtained
what
really
amounts
to
an
immunity
in
iowa.
that
violates
the
concern
of
the
extradition
clause,
the
concern
that
was
at
the
core
of
the
extradition
clause,
to...
which
is
the
protection
of
law
and
order
within
the
respective
borders
of
each
state
and
defeats
and
frustrates
the
administration
and
enforcement
of
criminal
law
in
every
state.
the
result,
of
course,
is
unsound,
and
is
contrary
to
the
express
mandate
of
the
constitution
and
of
the
statute.
second,
the
dennison
rule,
as
seen
in
this
case,
the
result
it
has
in
this
case,
is
that
it
frustrates
and
defeats,
also,
the
concern
of
the
extradition
clause
for
comity
and
respect
between
states.
this
case
shows
how
the
dennison
rule
invites
precisely
the
kind
of
friction,
the
kind
of
disagreements
and
retaliation
that
the
clause,
the
extradition
clause,
was
designed
and
intended
to
prevent.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
your
honor,
that
argument
really
is
not
in
point.
because,
as
i
explained
awhile
ago,
puerto
rico
is
invoking
both
the
constitution
and
the
statute,
and
it
does
so
because
of
the
fact
that
it
believes
that
the
constitution
of
itself,
on
its
own
power,
extends
to
puerto
rico,
the
constitutional
clause
involved
here,
the
extradition
clause;
as
do
the
other
clauses,
the
privileges
and
immunities,
and
the
full
faith
and
credit
clauses.
because
those
clauses
are
designed
to
create
a
national
unity
within
the
federation,
the
american
federation.
and
there
is
a
need
to
extend
those
provisions
to
a
state
like
puerto
rico
that
is
so
near--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--well,
it's
a
state
not
in
the
sense
that
it
is
a
state
of
the
union,
but
it
is
a
state
that
is
joined
with
the
united
states
by
a
compact,
and
has
the
degree,
the
same
degree,
a
similar
degree,
of
autonomy
and
independence
as
the
other
states
of
the
union.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
i
think
so,
sir,
i
think
so,
yes.
i
think
so
because--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--the
clause
refers
only
to
states
of
the
union.
but
for
functional
purposes,
and
for
historical
reasons,
the
clause
should
be
read
to
extend,
of
itself,
to
states,
to
other
entities
like
the
commonwealth
and
the
territories.
however,
it
did
not--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--well,
it
wasn't
written
that
way,
but
it
was
interpreted
by
the
members...
by
congress
at
an
early
date
when
the
object
and
scope
of
the
clause
was
common
knowledge.
and
the
congressmen
who
dealt
with
the
statute,
the
1793
statute,
which
has
not
been
substantially
changed
until
today,
interpreted
that
clause
to
mean
that
it
extends
to
the
territories.
at
that
time
there
were
two
territories,
the
territory
northwest
of
the
river
ohio
and--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--yes.
and
once
the
statute
applies,
as
we
claim
it
does,
then
as
i
stated
a
second
ago,
the
constitutional
issue
raised
in
the
dennison
case
as
to
the
interpretation
of
the
clause,
of
the
extradition
clause,
must
also
be
reached
by
this
court,
because
the
statute
and
the
constitution--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--but
the
statute,
mr.
justice
white,
the
statute
repeats
the
words
of
the
constitution.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
yes,
but
we
are
concerned
here
with
not
only
whether
territories
are
covered
but
what
kind
of
duty
is
imposed
on
the
state
governor
to
extradite.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
that's
right.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
that
is
right.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
the
court
interpreted
both
the
constitution
and
the
statute
to
mean
that.
and
as
a
matter
of
fact
chief
justice
taney
said,
the
constitution
leaves
the
performance
of
the
duty
to
the
fidelity
of
the
governor
to
the
constitution
of
the
united
states.
it
is
not
a
legal
duty;
it's
a
moral
duty.
and
the
statute
necessarily
does
so,
necessarily
leaves
the
duty
as
one
which
is
unenforceable,
which
is
a
moral
duty.
so
it
is
impossible,
i
respectfully
submit,
to
decide
this
case
on
the
basis
of
a
statutory
interpretation,
without
reaching
the
constitutional
question
involved.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
well,
that's
an
alternative
ground
for
reaching
the
constitutional
question.
but
the
constitutional
issue--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--well,
if
you
interpret
the
constitution
narrowly
and
literally,
with
all
due
respect,
you're
right,
justice
scalia.
if
you
interpret
the
constitution
functionally
and
from
an
historical
point
of
view,
you
may
not
be
right
as
to
that
point.
but
again,
i
say
it's
unnecessary
to
decide
that
issue,
because
there
is
the
alternative
ground
whether
puerto
rico
is
a
state
today
or
a
territory,
it
is
covered
by
the
statute.
and
the
case
can
be
decided
under
the
statute.
but
in
deciding
the
statutory
issue,
this
court
will
have
to
reach
the
constitutional
issue.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
because
they,
both
the
statute
and
the
constitution,
read...
must
be
interpreted
in
a--
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
that
is
right.
mr.
lino
j.
saldana
that
is
right.
