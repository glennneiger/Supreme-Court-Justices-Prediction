iowa
was
his
home,
was
it
not?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
do
you
know
why
so
low
a
bond
was
imposed
under
a
murder
charge?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
in
puerto
rico.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
i
suppose
there
isn't
any
explanation.
but
it
strikes
me
as
a
low
bond
on
a
murder
charge.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
spent
most
of
the
day
reading
it?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
this
is
the
kind
of
thing
we
hear
about
extradition
to
foreign
countries.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
would
you
make
the
same
argument
if
michigan
instead
of
puerto
rico
were
involved?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
things
are
tough
up
in
the
upper
peninsula?
