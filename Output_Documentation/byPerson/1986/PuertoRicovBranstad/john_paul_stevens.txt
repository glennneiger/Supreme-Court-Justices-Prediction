justice
john
paul
stevens
but
mr.
saldana,
is
it
not
true
that
even
if
we
read
the
statute
in
your
favor
and
say
the
constitutional
clause
doesn't
reach
it,
there
remains
the
constitutional
question
decided
in
dennison,
whether
a
federal
court
has
the
constitutional
power
to
order
a
governor
to
perform
this
duty.
that's
a
constitution
question,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
you
win
on
the
statute,
we
must
then
reach
that
constitutional
question.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
isn't
there
an
easy
explanation
for
that?
they
couldn't
do
that
without
defying
the
last
sentence
in
the
dennison
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
informal
mechanism,
as
i
understand
it,
is
that
the
governor
of
the
asylum
state
should
be
free
to
decide
whether
the
jurisprudence
of
another
state...
or
the
governor
of
another
state
is
equipped
to
protect
the
extradited
defendant
from
lynching.
and
you're
suggesting
there's
enough
danger
of
lynching
around
a
different...
one
state
or
another
that
we
should
simply
ignore
the
constitutional
command.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
that's
your
policy
argument.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
don't
follow
that
argument.
isn't
it
true
that
in
90
percent
of
extradition
requests,
or
maybe
a
higher
percentage,
they're
routinely
processed?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
only
the
exceptional
case
that
produces
this
kind
of
controversy.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
would
not
change,
would
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
say...
the
question
is,
which
governor
shall
have
the
final
say?
that's
really
what
it
boils
down
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
governor
of
the
state
in
which
the
crime
was
allegedly
committed,
or
the
governor
of
the
state
in
which
the
defendant
seeks
asylum.
one
of
them
has
to
have
the
final
say.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
the
only
thing
the
court
would
decide
is
what's
been
admitted
in
this
case,
whether
there
was
compliance
with
the
procedural
requirement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
what
issue
would
be
open
for
the
court?
justice
john
paul
stevens
supposing
a
lynch
situation?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
answer
would
be,
if
you
follow
the
constitution,
that
the
governor
of
the
state
where
the
crime
is
committed
has
a
duty
to
prevent
lynching.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right,
but
you
can't
challenge
an
extradition
on
that
ground.
there
are
certain
specific
requirements
that
must
be
met.
justice
john
paul
stevens
xxx
changed
to
whether
it
is
a
valid
judicial
act
of
the
other
state.
and
i
assume
that
there
can
be
fights
here
about
whether
there...
there
indeed
was
a
valid
request
from
the
other
governor.
justice
john
paul
stevens
xxx
because
no
state
generally
enforced
the
criminal
laws
of
another.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
why...
that's
why
they
put
it
in
the
constitution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
we
read
dennison,
it's
a
ministerial
obligation.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
should
overrule
that
part
of
dennison,
you'd
have
us
reject?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
suggesting
in
that
regard
that
we
should
treat
the
states...
this
is
an
aggregation
of
sovereign
states
that
are
just
like
europe,
might
decide
not
to...
it's
the
same...
similar
thing
in
that
area.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
the
reason
it's
not
is
because
we
have
this
clause
in
the
constitution.
