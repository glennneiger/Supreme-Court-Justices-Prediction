mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
the
question
before
the
court
this
morning
is
whether
a
state
can
require
a
recipient
of
afdc
benefits
who
receives
a
personal
injury
award
to
use
at
least
a
portion
of
that
award
for
future
living
expenses
in
lieu
of
receiving
afdc
benefits.
the
question
arises
out
of
the
enactment
of
an
amendment
to
the
social
security
act
by
congress
in
1981
as
a
result
of
the
omnibus
reconciliation
act,
and
that
statute
is
now
commonly
referred
to
as
the
lump
sum
rule.
essentially
what
that
statute
provides
is
that
when
a
recipient
of
afdc
receives
an
amount
of
income
in
a
month
which
when
added
together
with
all
the
other
income
available
to
that
family
in
that
month
exceeds
the
state's
standard
of
need,
then
the
family
must
be
disqualified
from
afdc
benefits
for
a
period
of
time.
that
period
is
determined
by
adding
all
that
income
together,
dividing
by
the
state's
standard
of
need,
and
the
resulting
quotient
is
the
number
of
months
of
disqualification.
congress
in
the
statute
uses
the
word
"income"
but
does
not
define
it.
the
secretary,
in
enacting
regulations
in
1981
and
'82
did
not
define
the
term
but
rather
continued
the
long-standing
federal
policy
of
allowing
states
to
treat
personal
injury
rewards
as
income
but
did
not
require
them
to
do
so.
on
march
18th
of
1986
the
secretary
enacted
a
rule
which
now
defines
lump
sum
income
and
requires
states
to
include
personal
injury
awards
as
income
subject
to
the
rule
save
to
the
extent
that
the
funds
are
earmarked
and
used
for
a
purpose
for
which
they
are
intended,
such
as
medical
expenses
or
legal
fees.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
under
current
policy
the
medical
expenses
and
any
other
directly
related
expense
is
deducted
at
the
front
end
when
determining
the
disqualification
period.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
in
1984
congress
amended
the
statute
to
allow
states
greater
flexibility
to
shorten
the
period
of
ineligibility,
and
we
have
done
that.
future
medical
expenses
and
a
number
of
other
situations,
if
somebody
steals
the
money,
or
a
family
member
absconds
with
the
money,
or
if
the--
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
--if
that
case
had
occurred
after
the
1984
amendment
to
the
act
that
person
would
not
have
been
disqualified
at
all.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
yes.
virginia
believes
that
the
secretary's
determination
that
personal
injury
awards
could
be
income
subject
to
the
lump
sum
rule
and
now
must
be
is
entitled
to
the
deference
of
this
court.
whether
or
not
this
court
gives
deference
to
the
secretary's
determination,
however,
the
petitioner
believes
that
virginia's
inclusion
of
personal
injury
awards
as
income
subject
to
the
lump
sum
rule
is
a
reasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute
and
is
consistent
with
the
intent
of
congress.
in
heckler
v.
turner,
this
court
had
before
it
a
case
involving
a
statute
enacted
by
the
obra
congress
involving
afdc
and
the
meaning
of
the
word
"income".
this
court
looked
at
the
language
of
the
statute,
its
legislative
history,
the
administrative
background
against
which
the
obra
congress
worked,
and
the
goals
and
objectives
sought
to
be
achieved.
in
that
case
this
court
determined
that
congress
did
embark
upon
a
new
course
which
in
that
case
was
emphasizing
work
requirements
over
financial
incentives.
we
believe
that
if
this
court
examines
the
language
of
the
lump
sum
statute,
its
legislative
history,
the
goals
and
objectives
sought
to
be
achieved,
and
the
administrative
background
against
which
the
congress
worked,
it
will
lead
the
court
to
the
conclusion
that
congress
indeed
intended
to
embark
upon
a
new
course
with
the
lump
sum
rule,
and
that
virginia
has
correctly
identified
that
course.
both
congress
and
the
administration
articulated
a
number
of
goals
and
objectives
sought
to
be
achieved
by
enactment
of
the
rule.
they
sought
to
restrain
the
growth
of
government
spending.
they
sought
to
redirect
benefits
to
those
who
are
without
income
or
resources
with
which
to
support
themselves,
and
to
reduce
or
eliminate
benefits
for
those
who
had
money
with
which
to
support
themselves.
congress
and
the
administration
sought
to
promote
responsible
budgeting
and
encourage
personal
responsibility,
but
of
particular
concern
to
both
congress
and
the
administration
was
that
the
prior
treatment
of
large
sums
of
money
had,
in
the
words
of
the
senate
finance
committee,
"the
perverse
effect
of
encouraging
recipients
to
spend
money
quickly
in
order
to
regain
or
retain
eligibility.
"
prior
to
obra,
a
recipient
who
received
a
large
sum
of
money
could
have
been
disqualified
for
the
month
that
the
money
was
received,
but
thereafter
to
the
extent
that
any
was
left
it
was
treated
as
a
resource,
and
as
soon
as
it
was
spent
down
to
the
state's
allowable
resource
limit,
then
the
person
could
immediately
regain
eligibility.
inclusion
of
personal
injury
awards
as
income
subject
to
the
lump
sum
rule
achieves
every
one
of
these
goals
and
objectives.
the
funds
remaining
in
the
hands
of
a
recipient
after
deduction
for
the
directly
related
expenses
by
and
large
represents
pain
and
suffering,
loss
of
earnings,
loss
of
earning
capacity,
and
in
some
cases
future
medical
expenses,
but
it
is
money.
it
is
available
to
be
spent.
it
can
be
spent
over
a
period
of
time,
carefully,
on
essential
needs
such
as
food,
clothing,
and
shelter,
or
it
can
be
spent
very
quickly
on
consumer
goods.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
if
someone
owns
the
house
and
they
sell
the
house,
we
would
treat
the
funds
that
came
from
the
sale
of
that
house
as
a
resource.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
yes.
but
in
those
instances
we
feel
that
a
person
does
have
to
have
a
place
to
live,
so
that
if
they
sell
their
home
they
are
going
to
in
all
likelihood
replace
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
no,
it
would
be
disqualified
in
either
event.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
that
would
be
counted
as
income
subject
to
the
lump
sum
rule.
and
the
individual
would
be
disqualified
for
the
period
of
time
that
the
calculation
worked
out
to
be.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
land
itself
is
a
resource.
and
if
the
land
is
sold,
we
would
consider
it
to
be
a
resource.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
yes.
we
believe
that
congress
did
not
intend
to
obliterate
the
distinction
between
income
and
resources.
they
still
did
use
the
word
"income",
and
in
other
parts
of
the
statute
they
still
use
the
word
"resources".
i
would
point
out
one
thing,
justice
blackmun,
that
our
resource
level
at
the
time
this
suit
was
brought
was
$600.
now
it
has
been
raised
to
$1,000.
so
when
we
are
talking
about
a
piece
of
land
it
has
got
to
be
either
a
very,
very
small
interest
in
a
piece
of
land
or
a
very
poor
piece
of
land
to
begin
with.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
it
is
now.
as
of
march
18th,
1986,
the
secretary
has
now
required
every
state
in
the
country
to--
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
--before
that
the
secretary
in
accordance
with
a
long-standing
policy
that
the
secretary
had
would
require
certain
things
to
be
treated
as
income,
such
as
a
retroactive
social
security
award.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
for
this
kind
of
a
payment
the
states
had
the
option--
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
--of
treating
it
as
a
resource
or
as
income.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
and
after
1981
to
1986
the
secretary
continued
that
and
said,
you
may
do
it,
but
you
do
not
have
to.
now
the
secretary
has
said
you
may...
you
must.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
the
secretary's
position,
i
believe,
is
that
the
statute
does
not
require
him
to
do
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
but
it
certainly
gives
him
the
discretion
to
do
it.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
yes.
we
believe
that
requiring
a
personal
injury
award
to
be
treated
as
a
resource
would
defeat
every
goal
that
congress
intended
to
achieve
in
enacting
the
rule.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
yes.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
0
xxx.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
no.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
well,
one
of
the
things
that
the
federal
rule
does
that
we
have
been
doing
differently
up
until
now
is
the
issue
of
casualty
loss
awards.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
that
right
now,
although
we
have
moved
to
change
our
rule,
if
a
car
is
destroyed,
we
treat
the
insurance
payment
as
a
resource,
assuming
that
the
person
is
going
to
replace
the
car.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
but
the
secretary
says
not
to
the
extent
that
it
is
earmarked
and
used
for
the
purposes
for
which
it
was
intended,
so
if
it
comes
in
intended
to
replace
the
car
and
they
go
out
and
replace
the
car,
then
the
only
difference
between
our
rule
now
and
the
secretary's
new
rule
is
that
we
are
going
to
have
to
ask
for
receipts
and
actually
go
out
and
see
the
car.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
that
is
the
only
difference
between
the
two
rules.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
well,
the
money
will
have
been
spent
by
that
point
in
time
in
paying
those
medical
bills,
and--
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
--yes,
that
remains
the
same.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
correct.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
it
is
in
the
statute
now.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
as
i
said
before,
justice
o'connor,
that
would
shorten
the
period,
so
we
would
disqualify
them
initially
for
a
period,
and
then
they
have
the
right
to
come
back
in
and
reapply
and
produce
these
bills
and
say,
i
have
incurred
these
medical
expenses,
or
my
husband
has
absconded
with
the
money,
or
i
had
to
avoid
an
eviction,
and
then
we
would
recalculate
the
period
and
shorten
it.
to
be
sure
that
congress
used
the
word
"income"
and
did
not
define
it,
respondents
maintain
that
the
word
"income"
should
be
interpreted
according
to
its
plain
and
ordinary
meaning.
the
word,
however,
just
simply
does
not
have
a
singular
plain
and
ordinary
meaning.
it
is
rather
a
concept
within
which
there
are
different
definitions
depending
upon
the
context
in
which
the
word
is
used
and
the
result
intended
to
be
achieved.
indeed,
if
a
plain
and
ordinary
definition
exists
at
all,
it
is
a
broad
one
which
includes
all
that
comes
in,
and
represents
an
increase
in
an
individual's
economic
power,
and
in
fact
this
is
the
judgment
of
the
seventh
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
watkins
versus
blenzinger.
we
believe
if
the
court
examines
the
purposes
and
goals
to
be
achieved
through
the
rule
and
its
legislative
history
the
court
will
conclude
that
congress
intended
the
word
"income"
to
be
a
broad
one.
the
administration
in
proposing
the
rule
to
congress
repeatedly
described
the
rule
in
terms
of
a
large
sum
of
money
and
gave
us
such
examples,
inheritances,
insurance
settlements,
and
retroactive
social
security
benefits.
congressional
documents,
both
staff
and
committee,
repeatedly
describe
it
in
similar
terms.
the
statute
that
was
enacted
by
congress
was
enacted
virtually
identically
to
that
proposed
to
it
by
the
administration.
it
expressed
no
disagreement
with
it
and
made
no
exceptions
to
it.
we
believe
that
if
congress
intended
to
restrict
the
definition
of
income
it
could
have
very
easily
done
so.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
certainly.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
again,
i
think--
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
--it
depends,
i
think,
on
who
you
are--
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
--it
depends
on
who
you
talk
to.
i
think
if
you
talk
to
a
lawyer
or
an
accountant
they
are
going
to
respond
from
that
background.
if
you
talk
to
the
person
next
door
who
has
seen
their
neighbor
all
of
a
sudden
have
money
to
spend
and
say,
did
they
receive
income,
i
think
they
would
acknowledge,
yes,
they
did
receive
income.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
but
even
within
a
technical
legal
context
the
word
does
have
different
meanings,
depending
upon
that
context
and
the
resultant
end
to
be
achieved.
i
would
wish
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
if
the
court
has
any
questions,
i
will
answer
them.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
ms.
hanken
is
wrong
on
the
figures.
if
you
look
at
the
district
court's
decision
the
figures
that
we
came
up
with,
it
was
only
231
cases
a
year,
not
500.
mr.
thomas
j.
czelusta
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i
have
no
further
rebuttal.
