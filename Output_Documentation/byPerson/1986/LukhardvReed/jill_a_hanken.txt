ms.
jill
a.
hanken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
virginia
and
the
secretary
of
hhs
reject
the
fundamental
concept
in
our
common
law
that
a
personal
injury
award
only
makes
the
victim
whole.
it
does
not
enrich.
there
is
no
gain.
but
virginia
treats
a
personal
injury
award
as
income,
and
as
a
result
parents
and
children
who
are
the
victims
of
accidents
are
disqualified
from
the
afdc
program.
because
virginia's
standard
of
need
is
so
low,
even
modest
awards
result
in
disqualifications
of
months
or
years.
for
example,
a
$2,000
award
paid
to
a
mother
with
two
children
in
richmond
will
disqualify
the
family
for
more
than
six
months.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
it
is
true
that
the
person
has
money,
but
the
purpose
of
that
money
is
to
compensate
the
individual
for
the
injuries
that
have
been
suffered,
and
the
problem
is
that
the
regulations
make
no
provisions
for
the
family
to
use
the
money
for
the
purpose
that
it
is
intended.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
congress
did
not
intend
for
multi-million
dollar
personal
injury
award
that
is
compensatory
to
be
treated
under
the
lump
sum
rule.
as
a
resource
that
money
would
disqualify
the
family
for
many
months...
would
disqualify
the
family
for
as
long
as
they
still
had
the
money,
and
they
would
have
to
spend
the
money,
and
the
agency
would
look
to
see
how
the
money
was
expended
to
make
sure
that
there
was
fair
value
received
in
return
for
the
expenditures.
and
only
when
the
family
had
$1,000
left
could
they
return
to
the
program
and
receive
afdc
benefits.
in
reality,
our
clients
have
not
received
multi-million
dollar
payments.
they
have
received
personal
injury
awards
of
$1,000.
a
disabled
father
received
$10,000
after
being
struck
by
a
car.
and
the
rule
is
not
intended
to
apply
as
broadly
as
you
say.
the
lump
sum
rule
was
a
very
small
part
of
the
obra
amendments.
of
$1
billion
that
was
to
be
cut
from
the
afdc
program,
the
lump
sum
rule
was
expected
to
save
just
$5
millions,
and
only
5,000
families
of
the
three
and
a
half
million
families
receiving
afdc
were
to
be
disqualified
from
the
program.
the
fact
that
virginia
is
applying
this
rule
too
broadly
can
be
seen
in
these
numbers
because
virginia
only
has
1.6
percent
of
the
adc
case
load
nationwide.
thus
under
congressional
estimates
only
80
families
would
have
been
disqualified
under
this
rule
if
implemented
as
congress
intended.
instead,
the
district
court
found
that
400
families
a
year
have
been
disqualified
under
virginia's
rules,
five
times
the
amount...
the
number
of
people
who
are
expected
to
be
disqualified
under
the
provision,
and
the
reason
that
so
many
people
have
been
disqualified
under
this--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--the
congressional
estimates
at
page
76
of
the
joint
appendix.
the
estimate
is
that
5,000
families
would
be
terminated
from
the
program--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--no.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
that
is
in
a
congressional...
one
of
the
reports
prepared
by
hhs
to
congress
estimating
the--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--well,
that
was
the
amount
of
savings
expected
from
this
particular
rule
change,
and
it
appears
in
the
obra
amendments
and
the
final
calculations
of
fiscal
savings
to
be
achieved
under
the
various
rules.
in
virginia
alone,
400
families
a
year
are
terminated
under
this
lump
sum
rule
because
they
are
applying
the
rule
to
far
more
receipts
than
ever
intended
by
congress.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
in
the
joint
appendix,
76.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
and
this
is
a
committee
on
ways
and
means
report
estimating
the
number
of
families
removed
from
the
rolls
and
the
expected
impact
on
the
budget.
these
committee
reports
also
indicate
that
congress
knew
that
the
new
rule
was
not
going
to
be
applied
to
all
payments
of
money.
throughout
the
committee
reports
congress
said
that
the
new
rule
was
to
apply
to
payments
that
meet
the
definition
of
income,
and
throughout
the
reports
the
single
example
of
income
was
retroactive
social
security
benefits,
which
is--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--yes.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
i
would
classify
punitive
damages
as
a
gain,
as
this
court
did
in
the
glentrell
glass
case,
and
since
there
is
a
gain
it
would
be
more
properly
classified
as
income.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
they
are
not
compensatory
at
all,
and
therefore
could
be
properly
used
by
the
family
for
future
subsistence
living
expenses.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
yes.
yes,
your
honor.
but
as
justice
white
mentioned
earlier,
there
is
an
obvious
definition
of
income.
as
this
court
has
found
when
looking
for
a
common
sense
definition
of
income,
there
is
a
requirement
of
gain
or
profit,
and
that
is
the
definition
that
has
been
consistently
followed
by
this
court
and
has
been
referred
to
as
the
obvious
or
the
natural
meaning
of
income.
the
definition
of
income
that
is
used
in
common
speech,
and
of
course
in
looking
at
602(a)(17)
we
must
look
at
the
natural
and
common
sense
definitions
of
the
words
used
by
congress.
congress
did
not
intend
to
apply
the
rule
to
all
payments
of
money.
even
the
secretary
still
says
that
if
a
house
is
sold,
and
certainly
a
large
amount
of
money
is
received
in
return
for
that,
the
money
is
a
resource,
and
the
money
can
be
spent
in
any
way
the
family
needs
to,
and
spend
it
down,
and
requalify
for
benefits
under
the
program.
the
system
here
creates
an
inequity
between
persons
who
receive
personal
injury
awards
and
people
who
receive
property
damage
payments.
to
this
day
virginia
still
treats
as
a
resource
money
paid
for
property
damage.
so
if
a
car
or
refrigerator
is
either
sold
or
damaged,
the
money
paid
in
return
is
a
resource.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
that
is
true
if
the
new
federal
regulation
is
valid.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
even
under
the
new
regulation
there
still
is
an
inequity
because
if
the
car
refrigerator
is
damaged
and
money
is
paid
in
return,
the
family
can
replace
the
car
or
refrigerator
and
return
to
the
program.
but
the
person
who
receives
a
personal
injury
award
has
no
opportunity
to
use
that
award
for
the
purpose
it
is
intended.
let's
look
at
a
pain
and
suffering
award.
the
family
cannot
make
any
expenditure
to
ease
pain
and
suffering.
the
parent
can't
buy
toys
for
the
sick
child.
the
family
cannot
buy
a
television
for
the
bedridden
person.
you
couldn't
weatherize
your
house
to
make
it
warmer.
mr.
long
couldn't
buy
a
used
car
to
help
him
travel
after
his
injury.
the
family
can't
set
aside
any
funds
for
future
burial
expenses,
which
is
allowed
by
congress
in
the
statute
as
a
way
to
prepare
for
the
future.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
your
honor,
any
medical
expenses
paid
with
the
award
would
be
deducted
from
the
lump
sum
amount
and
the
length
of
disqualification
could
be
shortened.
the
problem,
though,
with
that
is,
when
the
family
receives
the
award
they
are
told
that
you
are
ineligible
for
this
program
for
months
or
years
into
the
future.
and
the
family
may
not
even
get
the
medical
care
they
need
because
they
know
they
have
to
let
the
money
last.
and
the
other
problem
is,
some
future
medical
expenses
may
be
needed
beyond
the
disqualification
period
after
the
money
is
already
gone,
so
the
family
doesn't
have
the
ability
to
even
get
the
kind
of
medical
attention
that
they
require
as
a
result
of
the
injuries,
and
in
that
respect
they
can't
use
the
award
for
the
purposes
that
it
was
intended,
and
have
no
ability
to
ease
their
pain
and
suffering
to
make
their
lives
more
comfortable
or
better.
some
of
the
injured
persons
may
want
to
go
to
additional
educational
courses
or
training.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
it
is
not--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--well,
it
is
not
reasonable
because
when
congress
enacted
this
statute
in
1981
it
did
not
change
the
definition
of
income
in
the
afdc
program.
there
has
been
a
long
standing
distinction
between
income
and
resources,
and
congress
was
aware
of
that
distinction
in
1981.
in
fact,
in
the
same
year--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--your
honor,
in
1981,
at
page
23
of
the
joint
appendix.
virginia's
pre-obra
regulation
treated
all
lump
sums
except
for
social
security
retroactive
benefits
as
a
resource.
the
money
was
compared
to
resources,
as
it
should
be.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
there
is
no
evidence
in
our
record
that
any
state
was
using
an
option,
and
in
fact
the
documents
referred
to
by
the
secretary
and
virginia
are
all
post-obra
documents
discussing
an
option,
and
even
if
there
was
an
option
just
by
the
pure
definition
when
your
house
burns
down
or
is
sold,
the
money
is
a
replacement.
the
money...
the
nature
of
the
resource
does
not
change.
the
money
is
a
resource.
and
the
same
is
true
when
a
body
is
injured.
our
bodies
are
priceless
commodities,
and
money
that
is
paid
in
substitution
for
our
bodies
is
compensatory.
it
is
an
exchange.
it
is
a
conversion
of
one
resource
for
cash
money.
it
is
a
fundamental
concept
in
our
common
law
that--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--yes,
it
is
true
that
personal
injury
awards
may
include
an
aspect
of
lost
earnings
or
lost
earning
capacity,
but
most
of
these
situations
are
settled,
and
the
settlements
won't
delineate
between
that
portion
of
the
award
that
is
for
lost
earnings
capacity
and
the
portion
that
is
for
pain
and
suffering.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
that
is
true.
many
of
our
victims
are
children,
where
lost
earnings
or
earning
capacity
won't
even
be
an
issue,
and
in
any
case,
just
like
the
internal
revenue
code
exempts
personal
injury
awards
without
trying
to
figure
out
what
part
of
it
is
to
replace
lost
earnings
or
earnings
capacity,
the
money--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--there
is
an
express
exemption
in
the
internal
revenue
code
that
exempts
personal
injury
awards.
however,
that
exemption
was
based
on
a
long
history
of
departmental
rulings
by
the
internal
revenue
service
that
took
the
position
that
personal
injury
was
not
income
in
the
first
place,
and
that
is
consistent
with
the
opinions
of
this
court
which
find
consistently
that
in
order
for
income
to
be
received
there
must
be
a
gain
or
a
profit,
and
in
the
glenshaw
glass
case,
this
court
said
a
personal
injury
award
is
compensatory
only.
there
is
no
gain.
it
is
not
income
in
the
first
place.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
that's
true.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
yes.
the
secretary
has
consistently
been
shifting
its
position,
keeps
changing
his
mind
what
the
scope
of
the
lump
sum
rule
is.
his
latest
interpretation,
which
is
found
in
footnote
4
of
his
reply
brief,
demonstrates
the
extreme
to
which
the
secretary
has
gone
in
interpreting
this
rule.
now
the
secretary
says
that
a
house
or
a
car
is
sold,
that
the
money
received
in
return
is
a
resource,
but
if
the
home
is
burned
in
a
fire
or
the
car
is
wrecked
in
an
accident,
that
money
is
income,
and
the
rationale
given
by
the
secretary
even
though
in
his
proposed
new
regulations
and
his
final
regulations
adopted
in
march
in
the
preamble
he
said
that
there
could
not
be
any
rationale
for
distinguishing
between
large
payments
of
money,
he
is
still
distinguishing
between
large
payments
of
money,
and
now
the
house
which
is
sold
is
a
resource,
but
if
it
is
damaged
it
is
income.
this
makes
no
sense.
it
is
illogical
and
it
is
irrational.
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
the
definitions
of
income
and
resources
in
the
social
security
act,
and
it
doesn't
have
anything
to
do
with
what
congress
intended
in
adopting
the
new
income
rule
in
1981.
to
put
a
greater
value
on
homes
or
cars
than
on
our
own
health
and
well-being
is
illogical.
the
children
and
the
parents
in
this
case--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--a
gift
would
be
like
a
gain,
and
would
therefore
fall
under
the
common
definition
of
income.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
no,
but
the
secretary
does
not
have
the
ability
or
the
authority
to
interpret
the
word
"income"
in
a
way
that
is
contrary
to
what
congress
intended.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
it
does
not
include
recoveries--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--it
does
not
include
recoveries
for
personal
injuries.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
and
by
using
the
historical
definition
of
income,
accumulated
benefits,
retroactive
social
security
payments,
which
has
always
been
treated
as
income...
throughout
all
of
the
documents
of
hhs
that
has
always
been
viewed
as
income...
that
would
alone
have
been
enough
to
take
care
of
the
$5
million
savings
and
the
5,000
families
across
the
country.
it
is
very
common
for
families
on
afdc
to
receive
a
retroactive
social
security
benefit
when
a
child's
parent
becomes
disabled
or
dies
and
survivors'
benefits
or
disability
benefits
are
paid,
and
this
as
the
core
concern
of
congress
in
1981,
and
by
sweeping
more
and
more
items
into
the
definition
of
income
and
interpreting
the
rules
in
the
illogical
ways
that
the
secretary
is,
they
are
just
going
too
far.
the
parents
and
children
in
this
case
have
already
suffered
the
indignity
of
an
injury
caused
by
another.
the
policies
add
insult
to
their
injuries
by
terminating
their
sole
source
of
support
for
months
into
the
future,
long
after
the
money
is
gone.
the
policies
urged
by
virginia
and
the
secretary
make
it
impossible
for
the
family
to
use
the
personal
injury
award
for
the
purposes
intended.
they
can't
use
the
money
to
ease
their
pain
and
suffering
nor
to
set
aside
funds
for
future
needs.
the
policy
amounts
to
a
disincentive
for
the
victims
of
wrongdoing
to
seek
redress.
here
only
the
tort
fees
are
benefits,
because
the
families,
knowing
that
the
money
is
going
to
have
to
be
used
for
subsistence
income
support,
will
simply
not
file
these
cases.
the
rule
is
very
harsh.
as
i
have
said,
our
standards
of
need
are
so
low
that
disqualifications
of
months
and
years
are
not
uncommon
when
a
lump
sum
payment
of
money
is
received.
our
standards
are
sadly
out
of
date,
and
they
recognize
only
half
of
what
a
family
needs
to
live.
so
this
makes
it
essential
that
the
rule
is
limited
to
the
scope
envisioned
by
congress.
they
use
the
word
602(a)(7)(b)
of
the
social
security
act.
this
means
that
congress
affirmed
that
a
family
does
not
have
to
relinquish
all
of
its
goods
of
value
in
order
to
receive
afdc
benefits.
throughout
this
litigation,
for
the
five
years
since
obra
was
enacted,
both
the
secretary
and
virginia
have
not
treated
all
payments
of
money
as
lump
sum
income.
they
have
recognized
that
when
money
represents
a
resource
it
should
be
treated
as
a
resource,
and
the
secretary
still
says
that
as
far
as
selling
a
resource
goes,
that
the
money
is
a
resource
and
could
be
spent
as
the
family
chooses,
as
the
family
needs
to.
the
family
does
not
have
to
purchase
another
house.
instead,
the
family
could
purchase...
put
a
down
payment
on
a
house
and
buy
a
car,
or
put
aside
money
in
a
savings
account,
purchase
burial
contracts,
and
reallocate
resources
in
the
way
that
they

there
isn't
evidence
in
our
record
that
the
practices
of
states
was
varied.
the
secretary--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--the
federal
register
cite
at
that
point
in
the
federal
government's
brief
is
one
of
the
post-obra
cites,
a
preamble
used
to
explain
its
shifting
of
interpretation.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
that's
true.
that
is
what
the
preamble
says.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
no,
i
did
not,
your
honor.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
no,
they
haven't.
but
the
expected
cost
savings
and
the
number
of
families
affected
is
part
of
the
record.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
and
in
public
documents
virginia's
share
of
the
national
case
load
can
easily
be
found.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
it
is
essential
that
the
rule
here
is
limited
to
the
scope
envisioned
by
congress.
it
hasn't
been
applied
by
virginia
or
secretary
to
all
payments
of
money
because
congress
didn't
intend
them
to.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
your
honor,
i
don't
take
the
position
that
all
states'
practices
were
uniform.
i
am
saying
that
i
don't
know,
that
in
virginia
in
a
lump
sum
payment
was
compared
to
the
resource
level
except
for
a
lump
sum
that
represented
accumulated
gain.
and
that
was
virginia's
pre-obra
policy.
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
well,
even
if
the
practices
of
states
was
varied,
and
it
is
true
that
prior
to
1981
the
distinction
between
income
and
resources,
while
separate
and
different,
it
was
not
nearly
as
important
as
the
distinction
today
in
terms
of
how
the
two
are
treated.
in
1981--
ms.
jill
a.
hanken
--well,
the
one
thing
that
congress
knew
is
that
the
only
consistent
definition
of
income
was
accumulated
benefits,
the
retroactive
social
security
awards,
and
that
has
been
the
definition
of
income
for
many
years
by
hhs,
and
that
was
the
concern
of
congress
in
adopting
this
new
income
rule.
but
it
was
not
supposed
to
apply
to
all
payments
of
money.
it
never
has,
according
to
virginia
and
the
secretary's
policies,
and
it
still
doesn't,
even
under
the
secretary's
new
rule,
which
was
promulgated,
adopted
in
its
final
form
after
virginia's
petition
for
certiorari
was
filed
in
a
form
that
was
much
different
than
the
proposed
regulation.
they
are
trying
to
assist
themselves
in
this
litigation
through
their
regulatory
powers,
and
are
virtually
eliminating
the
distinction
between
income
and
resources
in
the
afdc
program
which
has
been
in
place
for
decades
and
which
congress
did
not
change
in
1981.
congress
did
change
the
treatment
of
income
and
did
lower
the
allowable
resource
level,
but
it
did
not
change
the
definitions
of
those
terms,
so
the
court
should
give
those
terms
their
common
sense
definitions,
and
when
you
do
so,
personal
injury
awards
will
not
fall
into
the
income
category.
instead,
personal
injury
awards
will
be
what
they
are,
compensatory
for
injuries
suffered.
every
penny
of
the
award
represents
an
actual
loss.
there
is
no
gain.
we
urge
you
to
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
fourth
circuit.
