mr.
glen
d.
nager
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
as
counsel
for
petitioners
noted,
this
case
presents
a
question
concerning
the
meaning
of
the
term
afdc
part
of
the
social
security
act.
specifically,
the
question
is
whether
the
secretary
is
reasonably
determined
that
states
may
treat
and
how
should
treat
personal
injury
or
workers'
compensation
awards
as
income--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes,
justice
o'connor.
that's
correct.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
change
arises
out
of
the
secretary's
examination
of
the
purposes
congress
was
trying
to
promote
in
amending
the
statute
in
1981.
if
i
might
back
up
a
little,
prior
to
1981,
when
there
was
no
lump
sum
rule,
whether
a
nonrecurring
receipt
in
the
form
of
a
personal
injury
award
or
a
worker's
compensation
award
was
characterized
as
a
resource
or
as
income
did
not
have
a
significant
effect
because
however
it
was
characterized
in
the
second
month
it
would
be
characterized
as
a
resource,
and
if
the
assistance
unit
still
had
the
money
from
the
award
they
would
be
ineligible
for
benefits
under
the
resource--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--right,
and
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes.
justice
o'connor,
the
rationale
for
leaving
it
up
to
the
states
prior
to
1981
arises
out
of
two
elements.
the
first
element
is,
the
practical
effect
was,
these
are
not
recurring
events,
they
are
single
time
events,
and
so
we
were
only
talking
about
one
month's
worth
of
benefits,
and
secondly,
the
court...
we
would
ask
the
court
to
keep
in
mind
that
the
afdc
statute
is
one
that
this
court
has
termed
based
on
cooperative
federalism.
it
is
a
statute
that
states
participate
in
at
their
option,
and
when
they
choose
to
participate
they
in
fact
provide
part
of
the
money.
they
administer
the
program
on
a
day
to
day
basis,
and
the
statute
is
replete
with
options
given
to
the
states
in
making
decisions
about
how
the
program
should
be
run,
most
importantly
setting
the
level
of
need
and
the
level
of
benefits--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no,
justice
o'connor,
the
secretary's
position
is
not
that
the
statute
mandates
the
personal
injury
awards
and
workers'
compensation
awards
be
treated
as
income.
rather,
the
purposes
behind
the
lump
sum
rule
specifically
that
congress
was
concerned
with
cutting
the
cost
of
the
program,
encouraging
large
payments
of
money
to
be
budgeted,
are
furthered
by
treating
workers'
compensation
awards
and
personal
injury
awards
as
income
and
thus
that
facilitates
what
congress
was
trying
to
achieve
in
amending
the
statute
in--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes,
justice
o'connor,
congress--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--it
is
a
exercise
of
the
secretary's
delegated
authority
under
the
statute
to
interpret
the
statute.
congress
in
42
usc
1302
delegated
rulemaking
power
to
the
secretary
and
throughout
the
afdc
part
of
the
statute
instructs
that
the
secretary
will
interpret
the
provisions
of
the
statute
and
be
responsible
for
administering
them.
in
that
capacity
the
secretary
prior
to
1981
determined
that
the
purposes
of
the
statute
would
be
furthered
by
leaving
this
particular
type
of
monetary
receipt
to
the
option
of
the
states
as
to
whether
or
not
it
should
be
treated
as
income
or
as
resources,
and
after
1981
examined
the
pattern
of
the
states'
response
to
the
1981
amendment
and
the
purposes
that
congress
was
trying
to
further
in
the
1981
amendments
and
thus
in
1984
issued
the
notice
of
rulemaking
proposing
that
personal
injury
and
workers'
compensation
awards
and
other
similar
types
of
nonrecurring
lump
sum
receipts
would
be
treated
as
income.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
well,
it
is
an
interpretation
of
the
statute,
justice
scalia.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
couldn't
have
put
it
more
succinctly.
the
secretary
believes
that
his
interpretation
is
reasonable.
by
looking
at
the
language
and
the
legislative
history
of
the
statute
the
states
get
no
guidance
as
to
whether
or
not
these
items
should
be
treated
as
income
or
as
resources.
it
is
common
ground
among
the
parties
that
the
statute
does
not
define
the
term
"income"
and
does
not
state
either
in
specific
terms
or
in
general
terms
whether
or
not
personal
injury
and
worker's
compensation
awards
should
be
treated
as
resources
or
income.
respondents
have
not
been
able
to
point
to
anything
in
the
legislative
history
which
shows
that
congress
intended
to
exclude
these
types
of
payments
from
the
income
calculation,
and
so
what
we
have
is
a
classic
case
of
where
congress
has
created
the
general
framework,
mandated
that
the
states
shall
take
into
account
any
income
and
resources,
and
then
not
define
the
term,
left
the
interstices
of
the
statute
to
be
filled
in
by
those
who
administer
the
statute,
in
this
case
the
secretary
and
the
states.
in
doing
that,
the
secretary,
guided
by
what
is
left
available
to
him,
which
is
the
purposes
congress
was
trying
to
promote,
has
on
a
case
by
case
basis
looked
at
the
receipts
that
a
family
can
receive
and
determined
in
his
judgment
whether
or
not
those
were
the
types
of
receipts
that
congress
intended
to
have
included
in
the
income
calculation
as
to
whether
or
not
they
would
further
the
purposes
of
the
statute.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
justice
o'connor,
i
quibble
with
your
premise
that
these
programs
are
designed
to
help
the
same
people.
in
fact,
the
food
stamp
program
is
available
to
a
broader
group
of
people.
the
afdc
statute
is
really
designed
as
a
statute
of
last
resort,
and
i
can
give
two
reasons
for
that,
at
least
two
examples
of
why
that
is
true.
first
of
all,
food
stamps
are
in
kind
benefits.
the
only
thing
the
recipient
can
do
with
them
is
get
food
with
them,
whereas
the
afdc
program
is
a
cash
grant
statute,
and
congress
has
defined
the
group
of
people
eligible
in
the
afdc
program
more
narrowly
than
the
group
of
individuals
eligible
for
food
stamps
in
the
food
stamp
program.
in
addition,
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief,
the
food
stamp
program
has
a
rather
all-inclusive
definition
of
income
and
then
has
an
express
exclusion
for
personal
injury
and
worker's
compensation
awards,
and
that
express
exclusion
is
absent
in
the
afdc
part
of
the
statute.
the
court
of
appeals
gave
three
reasons
for
refusing
to
defer
to
the
secretary
in
this
case.
its
first
reason
was
that
it
equated
the
concept
of
income
with
profit
or
gain.
it
said
that
profit
or
gain
is
the
plain
and
ordinary
meaning
of
the
term
"income",
and
thus
the
secretary
has
adopted
an
unreasonable
interpretation
of
the
statute.
we
pointed
out
in
our
brief
one
can
look
at
a
variety
of
dictionary
and
sources,
and
we
looked
at
the
ones
the
respondents
pointed
out,
and
the
term
"income"
is
defined
in
various
ways,
profit
or
gain,
gross
receipts.
in
fact,
in
this
court's
decision
in
heckler
versus
turner
there
are
several
references
to
the
term
"income"
as
being
a
broader
concept
than
the
narrower
term
"earned
income",
and
in
fact
in
several
places
refer
to
income
as
meaning
gross
receipts.
the
second
reason
the
court
of
appeals
gave
for
treating
personal
injury...
for
refusing
to
defer
to
the
secretary
was
that
the
court
of
appeals
looked
to
other
statutes.
the
food
stamp
statute
that
justice
o'connor
has
pointed
out
and
the
internal
revenue
code,
and
in
those
statutes
congress
has
excluded
by
express
provision
personal
injury
or
worker's
compensation
awards.
the
court
might
have
looked
at
the
ssi
program
where
congress
has
defined
the
term
ssi
program
to
include
personal
injury
awards.
we
just
don't
think
that
the
interpretation
of
the
afdc
program
can
be
controlled
by
the
decisions
congress
has
made
in
other
statutes.
rather,
we
have
to
look
at
the
purposes
and
provisions
of
the
afdc
statute,
and
as
counsel
for
petitioner
has
noted
and
which
i
would
briefly
summarize,
the
purposes
of
the
afdc
statute
are
promoted
by
treating
worker's
compensation
and
personal
injury
awards
as
income.
now,
the
final
reason
that
the
court
of
appeals
gave
for
refusing
to
defer
to
the
secretary
was,
it
found
inequitable
that
the
secretary
allowed
the
state
to
treat
personal
injury
awards
as
income,
and
yet
casualty
losses
as
resources,
and
said
that
that
violated
the
secretary's
own
equitable
treatment
regulation.
the
secretary
has
resisted
that
throughout
the
litigation,
because
since
the
secretary
gave
the
option
to
the
states
to
treat
personal
injury
awards
or
worker's
compensation
awards
as
either
income
or
resources,
the
state
was
merely
acting
pursuant
to
an
option
that
the
secretary
gave
the
states,
and
the
secretary
does
not
believe
that
when
a
state
acts
pursuant
to
an
option
given
by
the
secretary
that
the
state
can
be
violating
the
secretary's
own
equitable
treatment
regulation
at
the
same
time.
thus
we
would
ask
that
the
judgment
of
the
court
below
be
reversed.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
