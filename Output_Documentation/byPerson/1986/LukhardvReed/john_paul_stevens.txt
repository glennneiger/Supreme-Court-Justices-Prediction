justice
john
paul
stevens
but
the
rule
is
a
little
different
on
some
of
the
resources,
isn't
it,
such
as...
some
exchanges
of
assets
now
produce
income
even
though
they
would
have
produced
a
resource
before.
isn't
that
correct?
say
you
sell
a
car.
that
would
be
income
now,
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
under
the
new
federal
interpretation?
i
misunderstood
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
that's
what
it
was,
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
require
you
to
treat
it
as
income
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh,
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
there
any
change
in
the
treatment
of
the
medical
expenses
and
the...
that
you
up
to
now
have
treated
as
resource
rather
than
income?
you
deduct...
as
i
understand
it,
in
a
personal
injury
award
you
deduct
medical
expenses
and
things
of
that...
attorneys'
fees,
and
treat
them
as...
or
just
take
them
out
of
the
calculation
entirely?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
that
still
will
be
the
same
under
the
new--
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
ms.
hanken,
isn't
it...
it
also
is
true
that
in
many
personal
injury
cases
you
have
a
very
significant
element
based
on
loss
of
earnings
that
you
project
the
earning
capacity
in
the
future,
and
so
forth
and
so
on.
isn't
that
perhaps
subject
to
a
different
analysis
than
the
pain
and
suffering
part
of
your
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
it
is
certainly
true,
though,
that
a
person
who
has
a
substantial
salary
gets
a
bigger
settlement
than
a
person
who
has
a
lower
salary,
even
though
the
injury
is
precisely
the
same,
so
that
it
certainly
must
be
part
of
the
settlement
figures
as
well
as
the
awards
made
by
juries
and
judges.
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
that
kind
of
cuts
against
you
a
little
bit,
because
congress
did
it
expressly
there,
didn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
--may
i
ask
you
another
question?
your
argument
earlier
about
the
projection
in
the
hearings
of
5,000
families
and
in
fact
the
1.6
percent
that
virginia
represents
turned
out
to
be
much
larger,
did
you
make
that
argument
in
your
brief?
i
missed
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
did
not,
so
they
haven't
responded
to
it
yet.
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
is
in
the
record.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
but
you
make
a
point
that
the
congress
presumptively
knew
what
the
practices
were,
and
if
they
were
different
the
presumption
cuts
one
way
and
if
they
are
the
same
it
cuts
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
do
you
have
an
answer
to
the
5,000
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
thank
you.
