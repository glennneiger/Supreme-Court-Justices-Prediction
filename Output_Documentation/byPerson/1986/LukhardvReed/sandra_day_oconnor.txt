with
regard
to
those
items,
medical
expenses
and
legal
fees,
they
are
deducted
before
the
application
of
this
requirement?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
future
medical
expenses,
if
it
is
an
ongoing
medical
problem?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
how
about
that
situation?
there
was
one
of
those
examples
given
in
this
case
of
a
family
member
who
left
the
family
and
took
the
money
along.
now
what
happens?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
this
particular
family
is
disqualified
because
it
occurred
before
the
adoption
of
the
rule?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--well,
but
future
medical
bills
will
not
have
been
expended.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
is
it
the
federal
policy
that
governs
on
treatment
of
future
medical
bills?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
nager,
it
has
already
been
discussed
this
morning
that
for
a
good
many
years
the
department
left
it
up
to
the
states
to
decide
whether
to
treat
it
as
income
or
a
resource.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
now,
why
the
change?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
but
if
they
had
spent
it
that
was
all
right,
and
the
government,
the
secretary
left
it
up
to
the
states--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--and
then
all
of
a
sudden
there
was
a
change.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
point
is,
they
have
no
option
any
more,
and
i
am
wondering
if
the
statute
requires
that
interpretation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
so
you
rely
or
the
secretary
relies
on
some
power
to
enact
regulations
to
further
the
overall
purposes
of
the
statute?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it
isn't
just
an
interpretation
of
the
statute
that
we
are
considering?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
nager,
now,
under
the
food
stamp
program,
which
also
is
designed
to
help
these
same
people,
these
things
aren't
treated
as
income,
these
personal
injury
awards.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
prosthetic
devices
or
prescribed
drugs
or
anything
of
that
sort?
