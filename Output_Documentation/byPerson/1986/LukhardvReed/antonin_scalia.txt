justice
antonin
scalia
what
kind
of
receipts
wouldn't
be
treated
as
income?
what
continues
to
be
treated
as
resources?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
there
would
be
an
incentive
in
order
to
bring
the
resources
down
to
the
level
at
which
the
person
can
requalify
to
spend
that
money
as
quickly
as
possible.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
that
would
only
be
a
problem
if
you
sell
a
home.
i
mean,
if
you
are
selling,
let's
say,
a
vacation
home
that
would
already
be
counted
as
a
resource
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
converting
it
to
cash
instead
of
the
real
estate
wouldn't
make
any
difference.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
you
answered
justice
white
in
the
affirmative
when
he
asked,
is
this
required
by
the
federal
government
now,
did
that
answer
apply
not
just
to
the
treatment
of
this
income,
but
also
to
the
treatment
that
we
have
been
discussing
earlier
of
resources
such
as
a
home
and
so
forth?
is
it
all
standardized
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
all
of
the
answers
you
have
given
are
now
not
just
virginia's
view
but
everybody's
view
by
reason
of
federal
law.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
a
policy
judgment,
or
is
it
an
interpretive
judgment?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
would
think
so,
and
all
you
are
saying
is,
it
was
no
big
deal
before
'81.
it
wasn't
necessary
to
interpret
it
one
way
or
another.
it
didn't
make
a
whole
lot
of
difference,
and
the
secretary
had
other
things
to
do.
it
became
very
important
later
to
know
just
what
the
interpretation
of
this
was,
and
then
he
came
up
with
this...
that's
what
i
thought
had
happened,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
family
has
money
to
buy
their
necessities
during
that
six
months,
right?
why
is
that
unusual?
if
you
regard
this
as
a
statute
to
help
people
who
don't
have
money,
not
a
statute
to
replace
a
person's
arm
if
he
is
unfortunate
enough
to
lose
it,
the
fact
is
that
the
person
has
the
money,
regardless
of
how
the
money
was
come
by,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
let's
assume
an
individual
gets
a
multi-million
dollar
personal
injury
award,
multi-million
dollar.
the
person
is
a
millionaire
now.
your
contention
here
is
that
it
is
somehow
contrary
to
the
purpose
of
afdc
if
the
state
did
not
continue
to
pay
this
millionaire
afdc
every
month
because
of
the
manner
in
which
that
money
was
acquired?
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
obvious.
justice
antonin
scalia
expected
according
to
whom?
according
to
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
not
in
the
statute,
though.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
is
an
estimate
of
whom?
of
whom?
an
estimate
of
whom?
who
made
the
estimate?
justice
antonin
scalia
is
it
in
a
committee
report?
does
it
appear
in
a
congressional
committee
report?
or
is
this
just
what
hhs
told
a
committee?
do
we
know
that
congress
was
relying
on
that
when
they
passed
the
statute,
is
what
i
am
asking.
justice
antonin
scalia
where
is
this,
ms.
hanken?
you
are
looking
at
it
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
thank
you.
justice
antonin
scalia
they
are
not
allowed
to
do
that,
though,
are
they?
i
thought
that
the
federal
rule
now
would
not
permit
that,
but
virginia
just
hasn't
gotten
around
to
revising
its
rules
to
conform
to
the
federal
rule.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
okay,
but
your
argument
assumes
that
the
federal
regulation
is
valid.
so
that
inequity
does
not
exist
under
what
the
secretary
is
arguing
for
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
may
also
be
a
lot
of
people
who
can't
get
on
the
afdc
rolls
right
now
because
the
level
to
quality
is
too
low.
and
more
of
those
people
might
be
allowed
on
if
the
kind
of
benefits
that
are
paid
to
those
who
are
on
are
reduced
to
some
extent.
i
mean,
there
are
hardships
on
both
sides.
we
are
talking
about
an
absolute
amount
of
money
that
has
to
be
distributed
somehow,
and
the
secretary
has
said,
these
people
have
money.
we
can't
replace
the
arm
or
the
leg
or
whatever
is
lost.
this
is
a
program
to
give
people
money
who
don't
have
it.
these
people
have
money.
now,
there
are
others
in
the
program
who
don't
have
money.
i
would
rather
spend
the
money
there.
why
isn't
that
a
reasonable
determination?
i
mean,
it
could
have
gone
the
other
way.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
hardship
on
all
sides.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
aware
that
virginia
was
using
this
definition
in
1981,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
other
states?
was
there
no
state
that
was
taking
advantage
of
the
discretion
given
them
by
the
secretary
to
treat
this?
justice
antonin
scalia
there
is
also
an
explicit
exception
in
the
food
stamp
program,
isn't
there?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
is
set
forth
explicitly
that
these
things
are
not
covered.
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
what
about
a
gift?
is
that...
what
is
the
ordinary
meaning
of
income?
what
would
somebody
think
of
a
gift?
would
somebody
regard
a
gift
as
being--
justice
antonin
scalia
--you
think
an
average
person
would
consider
a
gift
to
be
income?
i
don't
know
that
that
is
so.
my
point
is,
don't
you
acknowledge
that
the
secretary
has
to
have
some
authority
to
give
some
meaning
to
income?
it
isn't
self-evident
what...
even
if
you
say
this
particular
item
you
think
is
self-evident,
is
it
your
contention
that
the
word
"income"
is
a
word
that
the
secretary
has
no
authority
to
interpret
because
it
is
self-evident
what
it
means?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
saying
its
entire
meaning
is
not
self-evident,
but
at
least
it
is
self-evident
that
it
includes
recoveries
for
personal
injuries.
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
sorry,
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wasn't
trying
to
trick
you.

justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
hanken,
you
surprised
me
earlier
because
it
was
not
my
understanding
when
you
said
that
the
practice
among
the
states
as
far
as
you
know
when
obra
was
enacted
was
uniformly
to
treat
these
things
as
resources
rather
than
income.
the
reason
i
had
the
opposite
impression
was
a
passage
which
i
found
in
the
secretary's
brief
which
says
that
the
practice
among
the
states
was
varied
in
1981,
and
he
gives
a
citation
for
that.
now,
i
didn't
go
back
and
look
up
the
citation.
did
you?
and
is
it
wrong?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
don't
need
testimony
on
that,
do
you.
i
mean,
couldn't
you
give
us
a
citation
to
the
federal
register?
it
was
a
federal
register
cite.
i
didn't
look
it
up.
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
does
that...
that
preamble
at
least
does
say
that
the
practice
among
the
states
at
the
time
of
obra
was
varied
+/?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me.
you
also
didn't
set
forth
in
your
brief
the
argument
that
the
practice
amount
the
states
was
uniform
at
the
time
obra
was
enacted,
did
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
did
you
contest
the
solicitor
general's
statement
in
your
reply
brief
that
practice
among
the
states
was
varied?
i
mean,
the
reason
i
ask
is,
that
is
an
important
point
to
me,
and
it
seems
to
me
that
you
should
make
your
argument
at
a
point
were
the
sg
has
an
opportunity
to
respond
to
it,
not
in
oral
argument
after
he
has
made
his
presentation
and
has
no
opportunity.
it
leaves
me
unable
to
decide
the
issue
on
the
basis
of
what
is
in
front
of
us.
