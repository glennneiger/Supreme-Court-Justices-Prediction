mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
before
turning
to
the
question
of
standing,
i'd
like
to
take
just
a
moment
to
describe
why
this
suit
was
brought
and
what,
substantively,
is
at
issue
here.
monfort
brought
this
suit
because
mr.
monfort
believed
the
acquisition
seriously
would
affect
competitive
conditions
in
the
beef
packing
industry.
monfort's
father
had
been
a
cattle
feeder
since
the
1920s.
the
company
went
into
the
beef
packing
business
in
the
early
1960s.
as
the
industry
moved
through
a
period
of
transition
following,
inefficient
firms
disappeared,
and
efficient
firms,
including
monfort,
survived.
a
leading
firm,
ibp,
emerged;
a
second
leading
firm,
excel,
assumed
a
strong
second
position;
both
with
resources
vastly
in
excess
of
those
of
my
client.
by
1983,
when
this
suit
was
brought,
this
was
a
no-growth
industry.
it
had
gone
through
a
period
of
transition.
it
had
stabilized.
and
it
was
not
growing.
monfort
perceived
that
this
acquisition
would
significantly
increase
the
power
of
excel,
and
would
result
in
the
leading
companies
becoming
even
more
dominant
than
they
previously
had
been.
he
saw
that
future
growth
in
this
industry
would
not
be
due
to
efficiencies.
he
believed
that
the
increased
market
power
created
in
excel
by
this
acquisition
would
ultimately
force
his
company
out
of
business
not
because
it
was
less
efficient
but
because
it
had
fewer...
far
fewer...
financial
resources
than
the
dominant
firms.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
the
consequences
as
found
by
the
district
court,
and
as
i
think
really
are
the
essence
of
what
the
injury
claim
is
here,
mr.
chief
justice,
are
these:
following
the
acquisition
here,
excel
would
have
a
very
substantially
increased
market
share,
something
over
20
percent.
it
would
also
have
the
enormous
financial
resources
of
its
parent
and
related
companies.
and
thirdly,
and
most
importantly,
it
would
have
the
intent,
which
we
demonstrated,
to
take
market
share
from
particularly
its
smaller
rivals,
of
whom
my
client
is
one.
and
lastly,
what
this
acquisition
did
for
excel
was
to
give
it
plants
in
a
geographic
location
where
it
could,
and
indeed
as
the
district
court
found,
there
was
a
distinct
possibility
that
it
would,
target
one
of
my
client's
plants
for
selective
price
cutting,
below-cost
pricing.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
that
is
true.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
because
my
client,
under
the
circumstances
posed,
and
indeed,
under
the
circumstances
found
by
the
district
court,
could
not
withstand
a
period
of
losses
for
the
length
of
time
that
excel
could.
and--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--yes,
it
is.
and
i
think--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--well,
i
think
i
need...
it
needs
to
be
said,
your
honor,
that...
counselor
quoted,
for
example,
from
the
trial
transcript
as
to
what
mr.
monfort
said
about
competition.
he
did
indeed
say
that
the
industry
was
competitive
and
had
been
competitive
in
the
past.
but
what
he
also
said
was:
i
can
compete
with
these
people
if
they
price
at
or
above
cost.
i
cannot
compete
with
them
below
cost.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
yes,
there
was.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
yes,
there
was.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
no.
what
he
said
is,
i
don't
know
what
their
costs
are.
and
indeed,
he
shouldn't
know
what
their
costs
are.
but
let's
assume,
and
i
know
that
he
does
assume,
that
we
are
essentially
operating
on
the
same
costs.
what
this
record
does
not
show
is
that
there
is
any
difference
in
the
efficiencies
of
the
excels
of
the
world
and
my
client.
and
therefore,
if
you
are
going
to
take
market
share,
which
excel
has
clearly
and
specifically
said
it's
going
to
do,
it
can
only
do
that
by
going
below
cost,
at
least
in
selective
circumstances.
and
that
necessarily
has
to
follow,
unless
you
can
establish
that
you
are
more
efficient
than
i
am.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
of
course
not.
but
i
think
what
you
have
to
look
at
in
those
circumstances
is,
what
is
the
purpose
and
what
is
the
legislative
intent
behind
section
7?
and
section
7...
the
problem
with
section
7,
to
the
extent
it
has
one,
is
that
it
does
require
a
prediction
of
future
events.
and
that's
what
the
district
court
did
in
this
case?
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
no.
i
don't...
i
think
you
have
to
go
on,
and
i
think
you
have
to--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--you
have
the
point--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--the
one
thing
that
i
think
has
got
to
be
put
to
rest,
my
client
is
not
concerned
about
increased
competition.
we
do
not
take
the
position
that
competition,
simply
because
they
are
bigger
and
we
are
smaller,
is
somehow
violative
of
section
7.
i
think
you
can
assume
a
circumstance
where
that
might
exist.
for
example,
the
economist
called
by
the
defendants
in
this
case
would
not
agree
that
a
combination
of
ibp
and
excel
would,
on
its
face,
be
improper.
people,
i
suppose,
can
come
to
differing
conclusions.
i
think
he
was
wrong
on
that.
but
the
point
that
we
make
here
is
that
the
district
court
did
look
at
section
7.
he
did
look
at
what
the
purpose
of
section
7
was.
he
looked
at
the
market.
he
locked
at
the
degree
of
concentration.
he
looked
at
the
trend
of
concentration.
he
really
did
follow
this
court's
precedents,
i
think.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
absolutely
not,
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
and
the
reason
is
this:
that's
the
requirement
of
section
2.
if
in
fact
i
have
to
prove
a
section
2
case,
we
can
put
section
7
aside;
it
would
have
no
purpose.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
but
there
is
a
considerable
difference,
i
submit
to
your,
sir,
between
matsushita
and
this
case.
one
is,
that
was
a
section
1
and
a
section
2
case
where
the
specific
intent
was
required.
more
importantly,
that
case
involved
an
alleged
predation
by
a
whole
series
of
companies.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
sir?
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
what
there
is
in
the
record--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--i
think
that's
true,
although
i
would
not
agree
with
you,
sir,
that
i
have
to
prove
intent,
because
that
isn't
what
section
7
is
intended
to
do.
it
really
isn't,
i
don't
think.
i
don't
think
the
legislative--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--well--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--it
certainly
was
not.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
well--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--what
we
did
show,
and
what
the
district
court
found,
and
indeed,
what
the
court
of
appeals
also
found,
was
that
the
concentration
of
these
markets
in
this
industry,
as
a
result
of
this
acquisition,
and
when
you
looked
at
that
in
the
light
of
the
trend
toward
concentration
over
the
past
generation,
clearly
brought
this
case
as
a
matter
of
substantive
section
7
law,
within
the
precedents
of
this
court
and
the
legislative
history
of
section
7.
so
then
you
have
to
take
the
next
step,
properly
so,
under
brunswick,
and
say,
all
right,
if
you
really
did
prove
a
section
7
violation,
that's
all
well
and
good.
but
how
would
it
impact
your
client?
and
the
district
court
did
that.
and
we
think
that
we
showed
that.
not
to
a
certainty,
because
you
can't
look
to
the
future
and
say,
this
will
happen.
but
you
can
look
to
the
future,
and
you
can
take
the
economic
facts
that
you
have,
and
you
can
say,
i
believe
it
is
probable
that
this
will
happen.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
justice
scalia,
that's
matsushita.
that's
not
this
case.
the
difference
here...
and
believe
me,
i
understand
that
prediction
is
required,
because
that's
what
the
statute
mandates.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
but
to
the
extent
that
a
company
such
as
excel
has
a
motive
and
has
the
resources
and
has
the
market
structure,
it
can
target
a
client
such
as
mine.
it
doesn't
have
to
drive
out
the
market
with
its
25
percent.
it
would
surround
one
of
my
client's
plants--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--no--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--well,
it
was
conceded,
it
was
found,
we
did
argue
it.
but
that
is
quite
different
from
saying
that
you
cannot
target
a
particular
plant.
the
argument
that
is
made
on
the
12
states
assumes
that
there
is
prior
uniformity
and
that
cattle
just
flow
within
that
12-state
area.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
yeah,
but
the
judge
didn't
find
that.
he
found
that
it
was
a
market,
but
he
did
not
find
that
there
was
uniformity
of
price.
and
in
fact--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--a
not
uniform
price.
a
disuniform...
i
don't
know
exactly
what
that
means.
but
i
do
know
that
there
was
not
a
finding
of
uniformity
of
price,
which
i
think
in
no
way
denigrates
the
finding
of
a
12-state
market.
and
the
result
of
this
acquisition
really
would
be
to
permit
excel
to
surround
one
of
my
client's
plants
with
several.
and
to
the
extent
they
wished,
to
be
selectively...
to
selectively
target
that
plant,
the
economic
circumstances
really
would
permit
them
to
do
it.
i
might
say--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--oh,
i'm
sure,
it
does.
there's
a--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--the
balance
sheet
in
1983
would
show
that
my
client...
total
sales
were
something
like,
i
think,
$900
million.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
sir?
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
the
total
assets
would
have
been
about,
in
1983,
somewheres
around
$50
to
$60
million.
and
gross
sales
just
under
$100
million?
just
under
a
billion.
and
the
net
earnings
for
1983
would
have
been,
i
believe,
about
$15
million.
the
beef
industry,
justice
powell,
is
a
debt-heavy
industry.
return
on
sales,
the
record
is
clear
and
the
findings
reflect,
are
less
than
one
percent,
for
excel
as
well
as
for
monfort,
and
i
think
the
others.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
i
think
the
record
indicated
it
was
number
five.
but
it
was
close
to
number
four.
i
mean,
four
and
five
were
close
together.
one
of
the
things
that
it
seems
to
me
the
court
below
did
was
to
give
effect
to
the...
what
i
understand
the
purposes
of
section
7
to
be;
and
really,
one
of
the
basic
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
and
that
is,
that
businesses
are
expected
to
acquire
profits
not
at
the...
not
by
acquiring
competitors
but
by
internal
expansion
and
growth.
and
that,
it
seems
to
me,
is
a
fundamental
principle
that
is
at
issue
here.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
it
is
not
a
ban,
and
i
appreciate
that.
but
certain
as
between...
as
a
policy
matter,
it
is
the
policy
of
the
antitrust
laws
to
encourage
growth
by
its
internal
expansion
as
opposed
to
acquisition.
now,
of
course,
we
all
know
that
plenty
of
acquisitions
take
place.
and
indeed,
there
has
been,
to
some
extent,
a
shift
of
economic
philosophy
in
recent
years.
i
expect
it
will
shift
again
in
the
future.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
the
language,
the
legislative
history,
and
this
court's
precedents,
is
what
i
would
say,
mr.
chief
justice.
one
of
the
things
that
occurs,
and
that
the
government
suggests
in
its
papers,
is
that
somehow
or
other
allowing
competitors
to
sue
here
would
lead
to
a
flurry
of
abusive
suits.
now,
as
one
of
the
members
of
the
court
suggested,
there
really
isn't
anything
in
the
language
of
section
7
that
says
you
can
draw
a
distinction
between
permitting
or
a
competitor
or
a
supplier
or
a
consumer
to
bring
this
lawsuit.
and
i
quite
agree
with
that.
the
notion,
however,
that
the
government
advances
here
is
that
somehow
allowing
a
competitor
to
bring
a
suit
will
cause
all
manner
of
spurious
suits
is
simply
belied
by
the
record
that
we
cite;
the
fact
that
there
have
been,
i
guess,
a
half
a
dozen
competitor
lawsuits
in
the
last
several
years
out
of
5,000
or
thereabouts
acquisition
transactions.
there
really
are
all
manner
of
tools
that
courts
use
everyday...
rule
11,
rule
12,
rule
56...
to
deal
with
anything
that
is
perceived
to
be
an
abusive
suit.
and
surely
that
must
not
be
a
valid
reason
for
preventing
my
client
from
bringing
this
suit.
the
other
point
that
i
think
deserves
making,
and
it
is
noted
in
the
briefs,
and
that
is,
there
really
are
only
two
issues
before
this
court,
in
our
view.
the
first
is,
do
we
have
standing
to
bring
a
suit?
does
our
complaint
allege
a
violation
of
section
7?
and
the
second
point
is:
did
we
prove
a
violation
of
section
7?
it
is
a
fact
that
the
tenth
circuit
did
not
review
the
finding
of
threatened
injury.
now,
that
point
is
disputed
in
our
briefs.
but
i
submit
to
the
court
that
you
cannot
find,
in
the
opinion
of
the
tenth
circuit,
a
review
of
the
finding
of
the
district
court
of
threatened
injury.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
i
think
it
does
not.
but
i
believe
it
is...
it
has
been
this
court's
practice
not
to
do
so.
that...
the
failure
of
the
tenth
circuit
to
review...
and
of
course
it
found,
it
says,
that
that
issue
was
not
raised
on
appeal
by
my
opponents...
was
not
cited
as
a
around
for
error
by
them
here,
nor
in
any
kind
of
a
petition
for
reconsideration
at
the
tenth
circuit.
it
clearly
is
not
jurisdictional.
and
indeed,
as
i
have
argued
to
you,
even
if
you
were
to
go
ahead
and
review
the
finding
of
threatened
injury,
i
think
that
we
have
made
our
record
sufficient
on
that
point.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
i
think
you
asked
two
questions.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
all
right.
you're
talking
about
the
barrier
to
entry
problem.
first
of
all,
the
district
court
clearly,
specifically,
and
on
a
complete
record,
found
that
there
were
significant
barriers
to
entry.
secondly,
if
you
did
have
the
oligopoly
that
you
suggest...
let's
assume
for
purposes
of
your
question
that
only
ibp
and
excel
are
left...
the
notion
that
somebody
would
be
willing
to
invest
the
sums
of
money
to
come
in
and
compete
with
those
two
companies
seems
to
me
to
fly
in
the
face
of
almost
any
reality.
it
would
be
about
like
suggesting
that
somebody
would
say,
well,
look
at
the
profits
that
ford
and
general
motors
are
making.
why
shouldn't
i
go
into
the
car
manufacturing
business
in
the
united
states?
and
i
don't
think
anybody
would
do
that.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
i
guess
i'm
not
familiar
with
what
you're--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--i
respectfully
disagree
with
you,
because
it
seems
to
me
it
is
the
perception
of
the
entrant
or
the
would-be
entrant
as
to
how
long
he
is
going
to
be
able
to
survive,
and
how
long
there
will
be
super-competitive
prices
if
he
enters.
and
clearly,
anybody
facing
a
duopoly
like
that
would
believe,
if
they
had
the
power
to
exclude
all
previous
competitors,
they're
not
going
to
sit
idly
by
and
just
let
he
come
in--
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
--well,
i
don't
know
that
you
can
assume
no
predation.
the
district
court,
among
other
things,
found
what
it
called
psychological
barriers.
but
what
it
really
was
talking
about,
i
think,
was
simply
the
fact
that
you
have
an
entrenched
company
or
companies
with
existing
customers
and
distribution
systems
and
all
of
that.
and
that
is
a
very
substantial
noncost
barrier
to
anybody
that
would
enter
a
high-cost
industry.
that's,
i
suppose,
why
you
need
to
look
to
the
future
when
you're
trying
to
make
a
section
7
prediction,
the
best
that
a
judge
can
do.
the
statute
requires
a
district
judge
to
make
those
predictions.
he
takes
the
best
evidence
he's
got.
he
makes
a
judgment,
in
this
case,
i
submit,
a
thorough
and
thoughtful
judgment,
a
judgment
that
has
been
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals
after
a
pretty
careful
review.
and
that's
all
he
can
do.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
yes,
sir.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
you
mean
the
one
that
we
attacked?
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
there
was
at
least
a
buy
and
sell
agreement.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
sir?
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
well,
my
opponents
did.
i
attacked
the
merger.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
yes.
there
was
a
binding
contract.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
i
don't
know.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
no,
i
think
it
is
not
moot.
that
subject
has
been
raised,
justice
powell,
as
a
reason
by...
particularly
by
the
department
of
justice
as
to
why
suits
by
competitors
should
be
frowned
about.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
in
this
case,
your
honor,
this
case
was
tried
on
the
merits.
within
2-1/2
months,
this
the
date
that
we
filed
our
complaint,
and
2-1/2
months
before
the
closing
date
of
the
transaction
that
we
sought
to
enjoin.
if
the,
judge...
and
since
the
judge
ruled
in
our
favor,
since
he
found
merit
to
our
complaint,
then
indeed,
that
transaction,
at
least
for
the
moment,
should
have
been
enjoined.
if
we
had
not
brought
a
meritorious
complaint,
i
assume
that
he
would
have
found
against
us.
and
the
transaction
could
have
gone
forward.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
that
you
can
carve
out
merger
transactions
from
any
other
kind
of
business
and
maybe
some
nonbusiness
transactions,
and
say
they
sort
of
deserve
special
treatment
at
the
hands
of
the
courts.
you
either
bring
a
meritorious
complaint,
or
you
don't.
and
that's
what
the
court
must
decide.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
that's
true.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
the
fact
of
the
matter
is
as
you
describe
it.
the
reason
we
didn't
below,
justice
scalia,
was
that
in
1983,
which
really
wasn't
very
long
ago,
it
seemed
so
totally
clear
to
us
that
no
one
had
a
better
claim
to
standing
than
a
competitor.
indeed,
i
confess,
we
looked
at
the
question,
but
we
didn't
look
very
far.
we
looked
at
professor
areeda,
for
example,
who
just
said,
of
course
competitors
have
got
standing.
and
i...
and
i
have
to
say
to
you
that
i
did
not,
as
a
standing
matter,
regard
it
as
a
serious
question.
mr.
william
c.
mcclearn
he
is.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you
very
much.
