mr.
louis
r.
cohen
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court
of
appeals
recognized
in
this
case
that
a
competitor
cannot
legitimately
object
to
the
merger
of
two
of
its
rivals
on
the
ground
that
the
merger
will
reduce
competition
and
raise
prices,
but
because,
the
court
of
appeals
said,
the
competitor
would
surely
benefit
from
such
a
transaction.
the
transaction
might
violation
section
7,
and
consumers
or
customers...
here,
we're
talking
about
customers
like
safeway
and
a
&
p...
customers
might
have...
would
have
standing
to
challenge
a
merger
on
that
ground;
but
not
competitors.
let
me
answer
the
question
that
i
think
was
implicit
in
some
of
the
questions
addressed
to
mr.
carr,
which
is,
why
shouldn't
we
let
any
interested
person,
particularly,
a
well
informed
competitor,
challenge
a
merger
on
the
ground
that
it
will
reduce
competition?
first,
the
statute,
section
16,
says
that
the
plaintiff
must
allege
threatened
loss
or
damage.
and
this
court
said
as
long
ago
as
the
borden
case
in
1954
that
this
must
be
of
a
sort
personal
to
the
plaintiff.
perhaps
more
important,
though,
the
statute
was
wise,
because
there's
a
real
fox-guarding-the-henhouse
problem
here.
the
competitors'
incentive
is
to
favor
mergers
that
will
decrease
competition
and
raise
prices,
and
to
oppose
mergers
that
will
increase
competition
and
lower
prices.
and
if
the
only
person
opposing
a
merger
is
a
competitor,
as
here,
that's
probably
because
his
instinct
tells
him
the
merger
will
intensify
competition.
and
i
mean
no
respect
to
overworked
district
judges
when
i
say
that
the
competitor's
informed
instinct
may
be
more
reliable
than
the
outcome
of
a
trial
full
of
economists'
charts
on
whether...
on
issues
as
elusive
as
this.
monfort
in
fact
brought
this
case
because
it
feared
intensified
competition.
mr.
monfort
testified
on
direct
examination
eloquently
on
the
point.
he
said,
ibp
decides
they
want
to
stay
number
one.
excel
decides
they
want
to
be
number
one.
they
simply
increase
their
production
by
working
saturdays,
by
being
very
aggressive
in
the
marketplace,
and
that
without
ever
talking
to
each
question.
question:
do
you
believe
this
would
occur
if
this
acquisition
is
approved?
answer:
i
most
certainly
do.
that
is
why
i
am
here
today.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
justice
scalia,
we're
not
urging
that
a
little
man...
this
was
a
billion-dollar-a-year
little
man,
monfort...
that
a
little
man
may
not
sue
and
say,
he
hit
me.
if
there
is
evidence
of
predatory
pricing
that
has
occurred,
there
is
a
suit
under
section
2
of
the
sherman
act.
what
we
are
urging
is
that
competitors
not
be
allowed
to
label
the
kind
of
intensified
competition
that
monfort
feared,
the
kind
of
future
intensified
competition,
to
label
that
predatory.
because
the
consequence
of
allowing
standing
on
that
ground
is
to
allow
any
competitor
who
wants
to
get
into
court
and
challenge
a
merger
that
he
fears
will
be
pro-competitive,
the
opportunity--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no.
in
fact,
we
think
that
the
notion
of
predatory
pricing
is,
as
this
court
observed
last
year
in
the
matsushita
case,
so
irrational
a
form
of
conduct
on
the
form
of
predators,
and
so
rare
in
fact,
that
no
plaintiff,
including
the
united
states,
ought
to
be
allowed
to
challenge
a
merger
solely
on
the
ground
that
future
competitive
activity
will
be
predatory.
it's
like
saying,
cohen
has
said
he'd
like
a
bigger
house
and
he
obviously
can't
afford
it
on
his
government
salary,
so
we
better
enjoin
him
from
robbing
the
bank.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
if
the
government
had
brought
this
suit
alleging
future--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--the
government
would
have
had
standing
to
allege
that
the
merger
would
reduce
competition--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--and
raise
prices,
which
is
our
usual
allegation--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--well,
we
think...
we
don't
have
a
position
on
whether
this
merger...
we
didn't
bring
a
suit.
we
looked
at
it.
we
decided
not
to.
we
don't
have
a
position
on
whether
this
merger
should
have
been
enjoined.
we
don't
think
the
district
court
decided
the
merits
correctly.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
that's
right.
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
there
really
were--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--justice
scalia,
there
really
were
two
quite
contrary
contentions
made
for
purposes
of
standing
and
the
merits
here
by
monfort,
who
did
bring
it.
monfort
alleged
standing
on
the
ground
that
there
would
be
intensified
competition
that
would
lower
prices
and
drive
it
out
of
business.
monfort
then
alleged
on
the
merits
that
there
would
be
reduced
competition
and
higher
prices.
we
are
arguing
that
a
competitor
does
not
have
standing
to
make
either
sort
of
claim,
the
first
because
there
is
no
violation
in
intensified
competition,
the
second
because
there
is
no
injury
if
the
consequence
is
reduced
competition
and
higher
prices.
the
government
certainly
has
standing
to
make
the
second
kind
of
claim.
we
think
that
the
problem
with
a
predatory
pricing
claim
is
both
a
substantive
problem
and
a
standing
problem.
it's
a
substantive
problem
because--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no,
it
does
have
to
prove,
under
the
brown
shoe
case,
a
reasonable
probability
that
the
change
in
structure
in
the
market
will
lead
to
a
reduction
in
competition.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
yes.
but
the
scenario
under
which
prices
go
one
way
for
10
years
and
then
start
to
go
the
other
way
is
a
scenario
that
i,
frankly,
don't
understand.
it
doesn't
reflect
a
profitable
or
feasible
strategy
for
any
competitor
to
adopt.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
i
don't
think
that
the
customer,
safeway,
has
an
interest
in
suing
to
block
this
merger
if
it
thinks--
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
--no,
a
private
party
can
sue
on
the
basis
of
an
expectation
that
the
consequence
of
the
combination
will
be
to
reduce
competition
and
increase
prices.
and
if
safeway
had
thought
that
that
would
be
the
consequence
of
this
acquisition,
they
would
have
brought
suit.
mr.
louis
r.
cohen
it
is
not,
justice
o'connor,
the
government's
position
that
competitors
may
not
sue...
categorically
may
not
sue
on
any
theory.
we
would
not
let
competitors
sue
on
either
of
the
two
theories
that
are
involved
in
this
case.
