mr.
ronald
g.
carr
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
two
issues.
the
first
issue
is
whether
the
plaintiff,
monfort
of
colorado,
in
seeking
to
prevent
the
acquisition
by
one
of
its
rivals,
excel
corporation,
of
another
of
its
rivals,
spencer
beef,
established
the
kind
of
injury
to
itself
necessary
to
support
relief
under
section
16
of
the
clayton
act.
the
second
issue
is
whether
the
acquisition
could
be
thought
substantially
to
lessen
competition
under
the
standards
this
court
has
employed
in
applying
section
7's
prohibition.
under
this
court's
decision
in
the
brunswick
case,
these
two
issues
necessarily
are
interrelated,
analytically,
and
in
light
of
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
brunswick,
the
court
held
that
a
damages
plaintiff,
in
order
to
get
relief,
must
establish
that
his
injury
will
flow
from
the
anticompetitive
effects
of
the
act
he
challenges.
in
other
words,
the
plaintiff's
theory
and
proof
of
violation
must
be
congruent
with
his
theory
and
proof
of
injury.
the
injury
must
flow
from
what
makes
the
act
in
question
unlawful.
all
of
the
purposes
that
the
brunswick
requirement
was
intended
to
serve
apply
just
as
much
under
section
16
as
they
do
under
section
4.
the
basic
purpose
of
the
brunswick
rule
was
to
assure
that
the
antitrust
remedies
are
invoked
and
are
deployed
in
circumstances
that
serve
the
pro-competitive
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
in
section
16
actions
quite
as
much,
and
perhaps
even
more,
than
section
4
actions
this
purpose
is
implicated.
indeed,
in
section
16
actions,
if
the
injunction
can
be
applied
to
what
may
he
pro-competitive
conduct,
the
public
loses
the
benefit
of
that
enhanced
competition
altogether.
in
this
case,
exactly
that
problem
is
revealed
by
the
record.
and
the
rulings
below
would
allow
that
danger
to
take
place,
and
disserve
the
purposes
of
the
antitrust
laws.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
an
acquisition...
if
you
mean
competitors
as
opposed
to
competition,
it
can
indeed.
but
an
acquisition
can
harm
competitors
in
any
one
of
a
number
of
ways.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
an
acquisition
can
harm
competition
by
so
significantly
increasing
concentration--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--and
raising
entry
barriers
as
to
make
the
market
perform
less
competitively.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
in
the
event
that
an
acquisition
had
those
effects,
the
standard
effects
predicted
by
section
7
horizontal
merger
analysis,
consumers,
large-scale
consumers
particularly,
would
have
an
interest
in
preventing
the
acquisition.
in
this
instance
where
the--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--the
usual
consequences
of
a
horizontal
acquisition
is
to
diminish
competition.
that's
when
it's
objectionable
under
section
7.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
it
would
not
hurt
a
competitor.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
there
are
kinds
of
horizontal
acquisitions
that
we
believe
could
hurt
a
competitor.
if
the
acquisition
involved
market
shares
so
significant
that--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--they
raise
a
credible
threat,
a
genuine
threat,
of
predatory
activity,
then,
if
the
market
circumstances
are
such
as
to
give
some
palpable
basis--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--genuinely
predatory
conduct.
that
is
to
say,
the
kind
of
conduct
in
which
a
firm
with
a
dominant
market
position--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--as
a
practical
matter,
predation
is
impossible
unless
the
firm,
the
would-be
predator,
has
at
least
close
to
a
dominant
market
position.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
well,
of
course.
the
predator
has
to
be
willing,
as
well
as
able,
to
deploy
that
dominant
market
position,
in
such
a
way
as
to
drive
rivals
from
the
market.
it
is
an
elaborate
and
difficult
scheme--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--consumers
are
directly
injured
by
any
sort
of
significantly
increased
concentration
in
the
market
that
gives
rise
to
the
possibility
of
oligopolistic
conduct.
but
oligopolistic--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--raising
prices,
reduce
supply.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
far
from
it.
any
competitor,
faced
with
the
possibility
of
diminished
competition,
that
is,
an
increased
likelihood
of
oligopolistic
conduct,
market
interdependence,
whether
tacit
or
express
collusion,
should,
faced
with
such
an
acquisition,
be
delighted.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
yes,
indeed,
there
is.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
section
2
of
the
sherman
act
looks
to
the
achievement,
whether
through--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--active
conduct
or
otherwise
a
monopoly
position.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
in
order
to
show
a
violation
of
section
7,
no.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
the
purpose
of
section
7
is
to
predict
probably
future
impacts
on
market
conditions.
as
a
consequence--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--no,
it
would
not.
section
7
horizontal
merger
standards,
those
that
the
district
court
used
here
to
determine
that
there
was
a
violation,
predict
the
likelihood--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--both
the
government
and
consumers
could
sue.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
a
competitor
can't
sue
precisely
because--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--well,
the
consumer
can,
based
on
the
facts
that
we've
been
discussing,
predict
a
possible
or
probable
future
effect
of
the
kind
that
section
7
forbids,
of
tendencies
toward
increased
concentration
and
reduced
competition,
which
under
the--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--it's
difficult
to
know
how
that
mechanism
could
operate.
if
indeed,
the
10
years--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--well,
what
happened,
as
i
recall,
under
the
standard
oil
case
is,
there
was
a
kind
of
competition
which
was
of
a
sort
that
led
to
increased
concentration
and
a
monopoly.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
partially...
partially
through
mergers.
but
that
is
not
the
consequence
that
monfort
predicted
here,
nor
is
the
mechanism
the
same.
on
the
record
here,
monfort
challenged
the
acquisition
solely
on
the
ground...
as
a
substantive
antitrust...
section
7
matter,
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
acquisition
would
increase
concentration
in
the
markets,
and
hence,
diminish
competition
at
some
reasonably
foreseeable
point
in
the
future.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
had
the
government
established
the
facts...
we,
of
course,
believe
that
on
the
merits
the
facts
do
not
show
an
antitrust
violation.
but
assume
for
the
moment
that
they
did,
there
would
be
no
question
that
the
government--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--no,
we
believe
not.
the
correct
standards
of
analysis,
this
court's
decision
in
general
dynamics
and
other
cases,
suggest
that
the
analysis
applied
to
the
facts
below
was
incorrect;
that
in
fact
these
markets
would
continue--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--our
point
is
both,
that
an
attempt--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--the
court
of
appeals
concluded
that
the
district
court's
analysis
on
the
section
7
merits
was
not
clearly
erroneous.
there
were
various
findings
of
fact
which
the
district
court
made
were
not
clearly
erroneous.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
well,
we
go
both.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
we
don't
believe
that
on
the
section
7
merits
it's
necessary
to
disturb
the
district
court's
findings
of
fact
in
order
to
conclude
that
the
analysis
that
applied
to
those
facts--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--that's
right.
but
we
believe
that
the
court
of
appeals
misapplied
the
clearly
erroneous
standard.
and
in
fact,
the
problem
in
the
district
court's
decision
that
we
attempted
to
identify
in
the
briefs
below,
and
that
we've
discussed
in
the
briefs
to
this
court
is
not
that
the
particular
findings
of
fact
were
incorrect,
or
incorrectly
reflected
the
market
realities.
the
problem
was
the
inferences
drawn
from
those
factual
findings
for
purposes
of
answering
the
ultimate
section
7
question,
which
is
to
say,
what
is
the
effect
of
this
acquisition
on
the
future
performance
of
these
markets.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
how
is
it...
how
did
it
affect,
and
how
is
it
likely
to
affect
competition.
in
order
to
make
that
sort
of
judgment,
it's
not
possible
to
lock,
as
the
district
court
here
did,
to
conditions
of
rivalry
under
very
and
intense
market...
a
market
that's
intensely
competitive.
the
answer...
the
question
can
be
answered
only
by
positing
a
possibility
that
the
leading
firms
in
the
market
will
begin
to
behave
collusively
or
attempt
to
behave
collusively
or
oligopolistically,
and
asking,
what
would
happen
then?
what
sorts
of
competition
would
be
called
into
play?
what
sorts
of
new
entry
might
occur?
what
the
fringe
firms--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--because
i
think
the
approach
we're
urging,
mr.
chief
justice,
is
the
only
approach
consistent
with
the
purposes
of
section
7.
section
7
asks,
what
is
the
likely
effect
of
this
acquisition
on
competition?
is
this
acquisition
likely
substantially
to
diminish
competition
in
the
market?
the
only
way
that
question
can
be
answered
is
by
looking
to
the
effects
of
the
acquisition
on
likely
future
market
performance.
if
the
dancer
that
is
a
source
of
concern...
and
the
plaintiffs'
contention
is
that
the
acquisition
will
increase
concentration,
and
that
that
will
lead
to
an
increased
likelihood
of
interdependent
or
collusive
conduct,
then
the
only
sensible
way
of
answering
the
section
7
question
is
to
posit
that
sort
of
conduct,
and
try
to
predict,
based
on
the
best
material
and
evidence
available,
what
the
likely
reactions
are
going
to
be.
can
in
fact
this...
these
firms,
the
merging
firms
and
their
principal
rivals,
come
together
and
interdependently
control
market
price
and
reduce
its
output.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
no.
no,
they
would
not.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
because
their
injury
flows
from
intense
competition.
and
if,
indeed--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--the
question
is,
how
does
the
acquisition
lead
to
the
oligopoly?
the
acquisition,
according
to
the
plaintiff
here,
both
in
its
brief
to
the
trial
court
and
its
brief
to
the
court
of
appeals,
could
lead
to
the
oligopoly
ultimately
and
in
the
long
run
only
by
increasing
the
relative
efficiency
of
excel,
its
efficiency
relative
to
other
firms
in
the
market.
if,
indeed,
the
mechanism
by
which
the
acquisition
leads
to
oligopoly
is
via
increased
efficiency...
and
efficiencies
uniformly
will
serve
the
benefit
of
consumers...
those
efficiencies
ultimately
and
inevitably
would
be
achieved
through
market
evolution
in
some
way,
sooner
or
later.
in
other
words,
the
injury
that's
being
complained
about
is
an
injury
from
the
normal
economic
evolution
of
the
market,
functioning
competitively.
and
it
in
no
way--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
no,
the
point
is
not
that
the
market
always
works,
but
that
the
antitrust
laws
are
designed
to
identify
only
those
circumstances
in
which
firms
behave
anticompetitively,
or,
through
their
voluntary
actions,
increase
the
likelihood
that
the
markets
in
which
they
participate
are
likely
to
perform
anticompetitively.
and
it's
vitally
important
that
the
antitrust
remedy
of
an
injunction
against
acquisitions
be
restricted
to
those
circumstances.
these
kinds
of
questions
are
extraordinarily
difficult
to
answer
with
any
confidence
at
all
in
their
accuracy.
the
data
that
are
available
to
answer
them
are
very
thin,
are
very
hard
to
come
by.
the
cases
must
be
tried
rapidly
because
of
the
timetables
of
these
acquisitions.
and
no
economists,
except
in
the
most
extreme
market
circumstances,
would
ever
say
that
he
knows
with
complete
confidence
what
the
likely
effects
of
an
acquisition
would
be.
but
exactly
for
that
reason,
it's
critical
that
the
plaintiff
before
the
court,
and
asking
for
the
court's
judgment
on
these
sorts
of
difficult
questions,
assert
a
kind
of
harm
that
is
at
least
consistent
with
the
anticompetitive
theory
on
which
he's
relying
to
establish
a
violation.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
as
a
matter
of
policy,
as
a
matter
of
general
principle,
it
may
be
that
the
rule
the
solicitor
general
is
urging
is
very
wise.
but
it
is
not
necessary
to
adopt
that
rule
in
order
to
decide
this
case.
there
simply
is
no
question
in
this
that
what
the
plaintiff
was
relying
upon
to
show
injury
departs
radically
from
what
it
was
relying
on
to
show
an
antitrust
violation
on
the
merits.
on
the
one
side,
diminished
competition
in
order
to
show
a
violation.
on
the
other
side,
enhanced
efficiencies
and
heightened
competition
in
order
to
show
that
somehow
the
acquisition
would
injure
monfort.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
this
case
was
tried,
and
the
record
is
available.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
they
didn't
prove
an
antitrust
injury
at
all.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
no,
i
think
that
the
brunswick
principles
require
that
the
brunswick
standard
be
applied
with
equal
rigor
in
actions
under
section
16.
and
i
see
no
possible
basis
for
a
distinction.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
no.
a
competitor
who
can
show
that
an
acquisition
causes
a
genuine
threat
of
predatory
or
other
exclusionary
conduct--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--there
are
other
kinds
of
exclusionary
conduct.
for
example,
a
foreclosure
of
supply.
or
foreclosure
of
customers.
those
are
the
kinds
of
anticompetitive
harm
that
can
lead
directly
to
the
elimination
of
a
competitor;
that
can
substantially
diminish
the
competitiveness
of
the
market.
and
acquisitions
have
been
found
unlawful
on
those
grounds.
that
sort
of
theory
of
violation
would
be
perfectly
consistent
with
the
theory
of
injury.
what
we
believe
you
cannot
do
is
to
assert,
on
the
one
hand,
as
monfort
did
here,
that
the
acquisition
will
diminish
competition,
and
on
the
other,
it
will
increase.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
it
is
often
by
no
means
easy
to
tell
when
it
does...
when
it
is
competitive
and
when
it's
predatory.
for
exactly
that
reason--
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
--but
the
courts
have
been
extraordinarily
concerned
in
antitrust
cases
with
making
exactly
that
distinction,
and
developing
tests
to
make
it,
precisely
because
of
the
danger
the
competitors
may
challenge
competitive
conduct.
equally,
in
section
7
cases,
where
you're
looking
to
future
predictions
of
harm,
exactly
the
same
sort
of
care
must
be
taken,
and
these
sorts
of
allegations
of
predatory
conduct
approached
with
extreme
skepticism.
the
use
of
the
term
"predatory"
in
the
courts
below
has
absolutely
no
meaning.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
no.
fierce
competition
is
simply
not
an
antitrust
violation,
and
doesn't
make
the
acquisition
unlawful.
mr.
ronald
g.
carr
precisely.
