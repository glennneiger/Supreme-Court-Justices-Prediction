unknown
speaker
which
is
like
what?
raising
prices?
unknown
speaker
which
wouldn't
hurt
competitors?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carr,
is
there
a
difference
in
your
view
between
section
7
of
the
clayton
act
and
section
2
of
the
sherman
act?
unknown
speaker
what
is
the
difference?
unknown
speaker
the
power
to
affect
price.
unknown
speaker
enough
power
to
get
the
price
up
a
little
bit.
do
you
have
to
get
the
same
degree
of
power
under
section
7?
unknown
speaker
so
in
this
case
it's
at
least
theoretically
possible
that
there
could
have
been
a
violation
of
section
7
but
no
impact
on
price
at
all;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
what
if
a
trial
judge
concluded
in
this
case
that
there's
no
impact
on
price
now,
but
when
the
industry
gets
sufficiently
concentrated,
it's
predictable
that
it
would
be?
and
that
with
this
merger,
that
evil
day
will
arrive
in
10
years
instead
of
20
years,
just...
it
moves
the
process
of
concentration
up
a
little
bit.
would
a
competitor
have
a
cause
of
action
under
those--
unknown
speaker
--xxx
could,
under
justice
steven's
hypothetical?
unknown
speaker
but
no
competitor?
unknown
speaker
well,
how
could
even
a
consumer
sue
under
my
hypothetical?
because
for
the
next
10
years,
things
are
going
to
be
very
competitive.
it'll
just
take
awhile
before
you
get
the
monopolistic
condition
in
the
market
to
have
any
impact
on
price.
unknown
speaker
what
if
the
defendant
came
in
and
said,
yes,
but
in
the
10-year
interval
between
arriving
at
that
period
of
time...
concentrated
market
in
our
present
condition,
we
can
have
even
more
intensive
competition
than
we've
had
in
the
past
while
the
process
goes
on?
could
the
consumer
still
sue?
unknown
speaker
well,
just
the
facts
in
the
oil
industry
under
the
standard
oil
case.
isn't
that
what
happened?
there
was
very
intense
competition
until
they
got
a
large
enough
segment
of
the
industry,
and
then
the
prices
went
up.
unknown
speaker
through
a
whole
bunch
of
mergers.
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
monfort
proved
enough
to...
that
if
the
government
had
brought
this
suit
and
proved
exactly
what
monfort
did,
that
there
would
have
been
a
section
7
violation
made
out?
unknown
speaker
no,
i
asked
you,
on
the
facts
that
were
proved
by
monfort
in
this
case,
if
the
government
had
brought
the
case,
proved
the
same
facts,
would
a
section
7
violation
have
been
made
out?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
that
your
major
point
in
this
case?
or
is
it
that
they
didn't
make
out
an
antitrust
injury?
unknown
speaker
the
court
of
appeals
found
at
least
there
was
a
section
7
violation.
unknown
speaker
so
it's
easier
for
you
to
go
the
antitrust
injury
route?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know
you
do.
but
you
don't
have
to
eat
up
some
district
court's
findings.
unknown
speaker
well,
we
review
the
district
court's
findings
here
under
the
same
standard
as
the
court
of
appeals
do.
unknown
speaker
and
in
terms
of
section
7,
how
did
it
affect
competition?
unknown
speaker
you
say,
mr.
carr,
it
has
to
be
done
this
way
that
you're
explaining
to
us.
but
isn't
that
itself
kind
of
a
factual
statement?
why
did
the
district
court
have
to
adopt
your
approach
to
it
rather
than
the
one
it
in
fact
adopted?
unknown
speaker
suppose
we
find...
and
i
know
it's
your
case
that
we
can't
find,
but
suppose
we
find
that
it
would;
and
that
the
end
result
of
this
whole
process
would
be
an
oligopolistic
market.
is
it
your
contention
that
there
would
still
be
no
standing
because
this
plaintiff
must
assert
that
it
went
out
of
business
in
the
intermediate
phase
of
competition,
assuming
no
predation
theory
but
just
fierce,
competition
which
this
plaintiff
says
will
drive
them
out
of
business,
resulting
in
an
oligopolistic
market
of
which
they
are
not
a
part;
would
they
have
a
standing
in
that
situation?
unknown
speaker
why
not?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
can't
you
lock
at
the
thing
as
a
unit?
isn't...
do
you
just
have
to
look
at
the
oligopoly?
can't
you
look
at
the
whole
process
that
leads
to
the
oligopoly,
and
say
that
if
it
does
lead
to
the
oligopoly,
the
submersion
of
this
company,
which
is
part
of
the
process
that
leads
to
that
oligopoly,
gives
them
standing?
unknown
speaker
the
market
always
works?
unknown
speaker
the
market
always
works?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carr,
i
take
it
you're
not
urging
the
position
of
the
solicitor
general,
that
there
can
never
be
standing
for
a
competitor
to
sue?
rather,
you
are
arguing
on
these
facts,
no
substantive
claim
of
anticompetitive
conduct
was
made
out?
unknown
speaker
this
case
isn't
on
the
pleadings
or
summary.
this
case
was
tried,
was
it
not?
unknown
speaker
and
the
question
is,
if
it's
essential
to
prove
an
antitrust
injury,
your
claim
is
they
didn't
prove
it?
unknown
speaker
do
you
agree
with
the
district...
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
standard
of
proof
for
antitrust
injury
in
an
action
for
an
injunction
is
less
than
in
an
action
for
damages?
unknown
speaker
mr.
carr,
if
i
understood
your
response
to
justice
white
earlier,
although
you
don't
agree
with
the
government,
in
theory,
that
a
competitor
can't
sue,
as
a
practical
matter,
that's
what
your
theory
ends
up
with,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
other
than
predation.
unknown
speaker
there
is
a
gray
area
you
get
to,
whether...
when
intense
competition
turns
into
predation.
unknown
speaker
well,
i
know,
but
in
a
section
7
case,
that
may
change
the
burden
of...
of
a
plaintiff's
burden.
unknown
speaker
so
certainly
you
don't
think
a
competitor
is
going
to
make
out
a
case
of
antitrust
injury
if,
as
justice
scalia
has
proposed,
he
alleges
that
they
are
going
to
compete
so
fiercely
that
i'm
just
going
to
have
to
go
out
of
business?
unknown
speaker
that
is
not
predation.
that's
just
competition?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
i
agree
with
you
xxx
that
the
incentives
are
as
you
say.
put
how
do
you
get
from
that
to
the
rule
of
interpreting
a
statute
that
you're
urging
upon
us?
it
seems
to
me
the
equivalent
is
to
say,
it's
very
unlikely
that
a
little
man
will
beat
up
a
big
man;
and
therefore,
we
will
not
allow
any
tort
actions
by
big
men
asserting
that
they've
been
assaulted
by
little
men.
now,
it's
very
plausible
that
the
vast
majority
of
those
suits
are
likely
to
be
frivolous
suits
or
harrassing
suits.
but
how
do
you
find
a
rule
of
law
in
the
statute
that
says
competitors
can't
sue?
it's
a
convenient
rule,
but
where
is
it
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
although
others
can
label
it
that
way?
you
allow
other
people
to
come
in
and
say
that
just
fierce
competition
is
predation.
but
you
will
not
allow
competitors
to
make
the
same
allegation
in
court.
and
i
just
find
it
hard
to
see
in
the
statute
any
principle
that
will
enable
us
to
allow
some
people
to
make
the
allegation
and
not
other
people.
unknown
speaker
so,
i
take
it,
then,
if
the
government
had
brought
this
suit
and
proved
precisely
what
monfort
did,
you
would
say
the
government
should
have
lost?
unknown
speaker
and
offered
the
same
evidence
that
monfort
did,
you
say
the
district
court
should
have
ruled
against
the
government?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
but
it
should
have
lost?
unknown
speaker
but
as
far
as
you're
concerned,
we
should...
we
could,
consistent
with
your
position,
assume
there
was
a
second...
that
the
government
on
this
evidence
could
have
proved
a
section
7
violation,
but
that
nevertheless,
monfort
should
lose
because
of
the
lack
of
antitrust
injury?
unknown
speaker
xxx
i'm
in
some
confusion
now.
i
thought
you
had
said
in
response
to
my
question
that
you
wouldn't
allow
the
government
to
make
these
arguments
any
more
than
you'd
allow...
which
was
contrary
to
my
reading
of
your
briefs.
now
if
that's--
unknown
speaker
--that
isn't
a
party
standing
question.
it's
really
a
substantive
question
about
what
will
establish
an
antitrust
violation.
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
may
i
ask
you,
with
respect
to
the
second
kind
of
claim
that
the
government
may
ask,
what
is
your
view
of
the
proximity
in
time
that
must
be
alleged
and
proved
when
the
change
in
the
price
structure
might
occur
in
order
to
establish
a
violation?
does
it
have
to
prove
that
immediately
following
the
merger
there
will
be
an
impact
on
price,
in
your
judgment?
unknown
speaker
sooner
or
later?
unknown
speaker
well,
is
it
correct
that
just
under
your
view
as
a
competitor
may
not
sue
because
in
the
interim
competition
is
more
intense,
also,
a
consumer
could
not
sue,
or
a
customer
also
could
not
sue?
because
they
would
also
benefit.
everybody
benefits
from
increased
competition.
unknown
speaker
what
it
really
boils
down
to
is
that
no
private
party
can
sue
until
the
market
is
affected;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
mr.
cohen,
i
suppose
that
some
mergers
might
hurt
competitors
in
nonprice
ways
that
are
anticompetitive,
like
foreclosing
a
source
of
supply,
or
something
of
that
kind.
unknown
speaker
would
you
spell...
what
would
be
the
consequences
of
its
having
far
fewer
financial
resources?
unknown
speaker
i
had
intended
by
my
question
to
ask
you
what
the
connection
was
between
the
lack
of
financial
resources
of
your
client,
and
the
potential
antitrust
injury.
because
i
thought
you
said
that
what
your
client
lacked
in
this
forthcoming
battle
was
financial
resources.
unknown
speaker
and
how
is
that
going
to
effect
it?
unknown
speaker
this
is
on
the
predatory
pricing
hypothesis?
unknown
speaker
0
xxx.
unknown
speaker
was
there
any
assertion...
was
there
any
particular
reason
to
think
that
they
were
going
to
sell
below
cost?
unknown
speaker
in
his
testimony?
unknown
speaker
as
i
recall
his
testimony,
he
said
something
like,
well,
it
depends
on
how
you
compute
cost.
they
keep
their
books
differently
from
ours.
unknown
speaker
or
unless
you
believe
you're
more
efficient,
in
which
case
you
would
make
the
same
statement.
do
you
have
any
evidence
of
predatory
intent
other
than
the
fact
that
they
are
a
company
with
more
resources?
can
one
assume
predatory
intent
whenever
you're
dealing
with
a
company
with
greater
resources
which
has
said
that
we're
going
to
try
to
expand
our
share
of
the
market,
which
i
assume,
by
the
way,
is
what
every
company
says?
do
you
know
of
any
company
that
doesn't
want
to
expand
its
share
of
the
market?
unknown
speaker
and
it's
enough
to
predict
predation
that
you're
dealing
with
a
company
that
has
a
lot
of
money
and
that
wants
to
increase
its
market
share?
that
alone
is
some
unusual
evidence
of
predation?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
what
more
do
we
have
here?
unknown
speaker
that's
my
point.
if
you're
running
a
predation
theory.
frankly,
i
didn't
see
your
theory
below
as
being
a
predation
theory.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclearn,
to
come
to
the
conclusion
that
predatory
pricing
will
ensue
from
a
merger,
don't
you
have
to
find,
as
a
matter
of
fact,
that
one
of
the
merged
companies
intend
to
drive
the
rest
out
of
the
market
after
they
have
sufficiently
cut
costs,
cut
prices?
it
isn't
just
a
general
kind
of
a
vague
movement
toward
intense
competitiveness.
doesn't
it
require
specific
intent?
unknown
speaker
well,
but
if
we're
talking
about
predatory
pricing,
and
i
thought
this
was
the
definition
that
was
repeated
most
recently
in
matsushita,
it's
the
intent
to
cut
prices,
drive...
so
that
your
competitor
can
no
longer
stay
in
the
market.
and
then,
when
they
have
dropped
out,
you
raise
the
prices
and
take
the
benefit
finally
of
all
the
losses
you've
sustained.
now,
that,
to
me,
requires
a
specific
intent.
that's
a
plan.
unknown
speaker
it
may
be
that
you
can
succeed
in
this
case
without
proving
predatory
pricing,
but
i
don't
see
how
you
can
prove
predatory
pricing
without
proving
more
in
the
way
of
intent
than
you
can
see.
what
intent
do
you
have?
unknown
speaker
what
do
you
have
in
the
record
to
show
intent
specifically?
unknown
speaker
yes,
sir.
--justice
marshall,
is
the
fact
that
as
a
result
of
this
acquisition
excel
will
have
a
market
share
something
over
20
percent.
it
acknowledged
in
its
own
papers
that
a
20
percent
market
share...
and
we
cite
it
in
our
brief...
will
create
price
influence.
secondly,
we
have
documents,
again
from
its
own
file,
saying
that
it
intends
to
inhibit
the
market
share
of
smaller
competitors.
that's
my
client,
among
others.
thirdly,
we
have,
as
the
district
court
found,
the
resources,
the
market,
the
economic
client,
that
would
permit
it
to
do
that.
now,
that
doesn't
really
say
that
it
will.
but
the
district
court,
in
those
circumstances,
is
required
to
make
a
prediction.
excuse
me--
--they
took
a
whole
lot
of
individual
points,
no
one
of
which
would
do
anything,
and
combined
them
to
make
the
intent.
unknown
speaker
xxx
cut
in
prices
isn't
exactly
section
7.
unknown
speaker
i
mean,
because
antitrust
wasn't
set
up
to
keep
prices
at
the
right
level.
unknown
speaker
so
then
you
have
to
show
something
in
addition
to
cutting
prices.
that's
all
the
chief
justice
was
saying.
unknown
speaker
cutting
prices
alone
doesn't
do
it.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclearn,
let's
assume
that.
let's
assume
you
even
have
to
show
less.
let's
assume
that
all
you
have
to
show
is
that
there
is
more
likely
to
be
a
predatory
intent
here
than
there
would
in
the
normal
case.
how
do
you
derive
that
merely
from
the
fact
that
here
you
have
a
company
with
deep
pockets
which
will
ultimately
have
20-some-odd
percent
share
of
the
market?
to
succeed
in
predatory
pricing,
don't
you
need
enough
of
the
market
share,
or
enough
capacity,
at
least,
to
meet
the
entire
market
demand?
otherwise,
you
sell
your
25
percent
below
cost.
there's
no
more
of
the
goods
left.
your
competitors,
far
from
being
driven
cut,
are
then
able
to
supply
the
other
75
percent
at
a
handsome
profit.
so
you're
losing
money
and
they're
gaining
money.
unknown
speaker
granted.
unknown
speaker
how
could
it
surround...
you
have
a
12-state
market.
i
thought
that
that
was
what
you
argued,
and
that's
what
the
lower
court
found.
unknown
speaker
how
can
you
target
a
single
plant
if
it's
conceded
that
the
market
is
a
12-state
area?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
a
market
means.
unknown
speaker
excuse
me.
you
have
a
single
market
with
a
disuniform
price
throughout...
in
different
pieces
of
it.
that's
a
strange
phenomenon,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
0
xxx.
unknown
speaker
what
would
its
balance
sheet
show?
unknown
speaker
that's
a
profit
and
loss
statement.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
total
assets?
unknown
speaker
your
client
is
number
four
in
the
market?
unknown
speaker
but
if
that
were
true,
the
section
7
would
have
simply
would
have
banned
any
acquisition,
rather
than
saying,
only
those
acquisitions
which
will
substantially
lessen
competition
are
bad,
wouldn't
it?
unknown
speaker
but
certainly
a
good
bedrock
place
to
look
for
the
policy
of
section
7
is
the
language
of
section
7,
i
would
assume.
unknown
speaker
why
does
that
prevent
us
from
reviewing
it?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclearn,
let's
assume
that
the
courts
below
hadn't
proceeded
on
a
predation
theory.
and
as
i
told
you
before,
that's
the
way
i
read
their
opinion;
that
what
they're
talking
about
is
cost-price
squeeze,
that
is
that,
simply,
the
increased
ability
of
this
company
to
compete
will
drive
out
the
plaintiff.
let's
assume
that
that's
what
they
said.
and
that
this
would
lead
to
an
oligopoly
market,
thereby
harming
the
public
interest
in
the
way
that
the
law
prescribes.
what
reason
would
there
be
to
believe
that
it
would
lead
to
an
oligopoly
market?
how
could
an
oligopoly
market
be
maintained
in
this
industry,
with
the
entry
being
as
easy
as
it
seems
to
me
it
would
be,
once
other
people
had
been
driven
out?
specifically,
you
assert
that
the
manufacturing
equipment
is
not
useable
for
other
purposes.
so
no
matter
how
many
people
you
drive
out,
the
equipment
would
be
lying
there
idle.
so
that
if
anybody
wants
to
come
back
in,
they
can
pick
it
up
for
a
song
and
get
right
back
into
the
business.
how
do
you
have
an
oligopoly
problem?
unknown
speaker
i
think
it's
all
one.
unknown
speaker
but
the
united
states
just
did
it
recently.
unknown
speaker
i'm
talking
about
the
chrysler
bailout.
it
surely
depends
on
how
much
it
costs
you
to
pick
up
the
equipment
that
is
to
be
used
to
manufacture
the
competitive
product.
unknown
speaker
you
forget,
we're
assuming
no
predation.
we're
assuming
no
predation
here.
we're
assuming
it's
just
fierce
competition
he
has
to
confront.
why
wouldn't
it
pay
him
to
come
into
an
industry
that
seems
to
be
making
a
higher
than
normal
profit
by
picking
up
the
equipment
of
those
companies
that
have
gone
out
of
business,
and
which
equipment
is
just
lying
around?
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclearn?
unknown
speaker
this
complaint
was
brought
three
years
ago.
did
you
have
a
merger
agreement?
how
is
the
deal
to
be
consummated?
by
a
merger
agreement?
unknown
speaker
yes.
unknown
speaker
is
that
a
binding
contract?
unknown
speaker
you
had
a
binding
contract?
unknown
speaker
i
understand
that.
unknown
speaker
what's
the
status
of
that
contract
today,
three
years
later?
unknown
speaker
were
there
any
outs
in
it?
is
the
case
moot?
you'd
probably
like
to
have
it
moot,
i
suppose.
unknown
speaker
it's
a
favorite
way
to
defeat
a
takeover.
unknown
speaker
mr.
mcclearn,
you
have
claimed
standing
up
here,
although
you
did
not
below,
not
just
in
your
capacity
as
a
manufacturer
of
boxed
beef,
but
also
on
the
basis
that
monfort
is
a
supplier
of
fed
cattle.
unknown
speaker
now,
as
i
recall,
it
was
conceded
below
that
suppliers
of
fed
cattle
would
have
standing.
if
that
was
so,
why
didn't
you...
and
if
indeed
you
are
so
clearly
a
supplier
of
fed
cattle,
why
didn't
you
simply
say,
well,
we're
that,
too,
below?
unknown
speaker
the
professor
is
on
your
opponent's
brief.
unknown
speaker
the
honorable
court
is
now
adjourned
until
tomorrow
at
ten
o'clock.
