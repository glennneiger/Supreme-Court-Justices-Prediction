ardith

mr.
lee,
you
may
begin
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
is
this
process,
is
it
civil;
is
it
criminal;
is
it
both?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
nager.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
is
there
reason
to
think
she
would
have
been
fired
if
she
had
said
that,
but
then
it
turned
out
that
she
didn't
mean
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
nager.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cutler.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
the
desirability
of
assassinating
the
president
is
a
matter
of
public
concern?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
are
you
suggesting--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--are
you
suggesting,
mr.
cutler,
that
there's
a
difference
between
saying,
"i
think
all
sorts
of
people
should
be
assassinated,
and
i
think
president
reagan
should
be
assassinated?
"
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
that
takes
it
out
of
the
context
of
favoring
assassination?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
the
record
supports
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
mcpherson
expressed
an
actual
wish
for
the
assassination
of
the
president.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
watts
is
still
good
law?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that
was
upheld
in
dowd.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
cutler.
the
case
is
submitted.
