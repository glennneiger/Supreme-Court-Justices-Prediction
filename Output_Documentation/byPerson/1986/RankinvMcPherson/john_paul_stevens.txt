mr.
nager,
may
i?
to
the
extent
you
emphasize
the
enforcement
of
the
law,
supposing
this
had
been
a
radio
report
of
the
almost-killing
of
gadhafi,
and
she
said,
"i
hope
the
next
time
they
get
him?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
make
the
same
argument
in
that
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
you
make
the
same
argument...
say,
it
wasn't
gadhafi.
say
some
other
unpopular
figure,
al
capone.
they
tried
to
shoot
him,
but
they
missed.
and
she
said,
"i
hope
next
time
they
get
him.
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
would
be
the
same?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
we
can
disregard
the
fact
that
the
president
of
the
united
states
is
involved?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
would
make
the
same
argument.
you
would
say
the
statement
was
unprotected,
if
she
said,
"i
hope
the
next
time
they
try
to
kill
al
capone,
they
kill
him.
"
you
would
make
precisely
the
same
argument?
it
wouldn't
be
quite
as
strong.
that's
what
justice
scalia
pointed
out.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you'd
even
make
the
argument,
if
she
said,
"the
next
time
they
try
to
steal
a
loaf
of
bread,
i
hope
he
gets
away
with
it?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
she
could
be
fired
for
that.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
following
up
on
justice
marshall
just
a
minute:
who
are
the
pupils
in
this
case?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
another
question?
we
started
out
with
president
roosevelt.
i
remember
that
there
was
an
assassination
attempt
on
him.
supposing
four
years
later,
an
employee
said,
"i
think
the
country
would
be
better
off
if
they
had
gotten
him?
"
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
the
employee
would
act...
you
think
this
is
a
suggestion
that
this
person
would
try
to
kill
the
president?
justice
john
paul
stevens
oh?
justice
john
paul
stevens
you're
changing
the
hypothetical
a
little.
"not
only
do
i
think
the
government...
the
country
would
be
better
off
if
they
had
gotten
him
four
years
ago,
but
i've
thought
about
it
a
great
deal,
and
i
really
wish
they
had
hit
him.
"
