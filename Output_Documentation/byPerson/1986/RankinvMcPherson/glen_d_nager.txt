mr.
glen
d.
nager
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
may
it
please
the
court,
this
court
has
noted
on
more
than
one
occasion
that
the
state's
interests
as
an
employer
in
regulating
the
expressive
activities
of
its
employees
differs
quite
significantly
from
those
it
possesses
in
connection
with
regulation
of
the
speech
of
the
citizenry
in
general.
the
court
has
upheld
various
restrictions
on
the
expressive
activities
of
public
employees,
restrictions
that
could
not
have
been
applied
to
the
citizenry
in
general.
for
example,
in
snepp
versus
united
states,
this
court
upheld
the
right
of
the
cia
to
screen
its
employees'
publications,
a
system
of
prior
restraint
which
simply
could
not
have
been
applied
to
the
citizenry
in
general.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
short
answer
is
yes,
although
i'm
not
quite
sure
you
can
separate
them
out--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--by
what
the
constable
said.
in
fact,
as
we
read
the
record,
he
terminated
her
for
expressing
her
approval
of
the
violation
of
a
serious
criminal
law;
that
is,
he
did
fire
her
for
what
she
said.
i'm
not
quite
sure
there's
another
way
she
could
have
said
the
same
thing,
that
he
could
have
just
fired
her
for
the
manner
of
her
expression.
but
we
do
think
he
did
fire
her
for
the
substance
of
what
she
said;
that
is,
that
if
they
go
for
him
again,
i
hope
they
get
him.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
record
doesn't
reflect
what
constable
rankin's
thinking
was
on
that
subject,
justice
rehnquist.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
he
did,
which
shows
that
he
was
trying
to
find
out
whether
or
not
she
was
an
individual
who
indeed
believed
that
it
was
okay
to
assassinate...
attempt
to
assassinate
the
president,
to
violate
criminal
laws.
now,
we
think
that
this
court's
decision
emphasized
two
things
in
public
employees'
speech
cases.
the
first
is
that
the
government's
interest
as
an
employer
differ
from
those
it
has
when
it
acts
in
its
capacity
as
a
sovereign.
and,
in
addition,
employment-related
sanctions,
while
placing
a
burden
on
first
amendment
rights
to
be
sure,
are
a
much
lesser
burden
than
general
criminal
or
civil
sanctions.
thus,
the
court
has
upheld
the
right
of
the
government
to
place
reasonable
restrictions
on
the
expressive
activities
of
public
employees,
in
order
to
promote
substantial
governmental
interests.
and
we
think
that
this
is
precisely
such
a
case.
respondent
in
this
case
was
an
employee
of
a
law
enforcement
agency,
and
she
expressed
her
approval
and
desire
for
an
assassination
of
the
president.
the
law
enforcement
agency
for
which
she
worked
is
by
definition
committed
to
the
enforcement
of
criminal
laws.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
clerk's
office
of
the
court
system
of
harris
county?
mr.
glen
d.
nager
we
believe
the
answer
would
be
the
same,
justice
o'connor,
although
the
twist
on
the
theory
would
be
slightly
different.
here,
the
constable's
office
is
a
law
enforcement
agency;
and
the
expressive
activity
is
directly
inconsistent
with
the
principal
function
of
that
office.
that
is,
it
is
a
law
enforcement
agency.
the
clerk's
office
would
not
be,
quote,
a
law
enforcement
agency.
but
it
does
have
an
interest
in
having
employees
who
won't
engage
in
expressive
activity
inconsistent
with
its
function.
and
when
an
employee--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--when
an
employee
expresses
approval
of
a
violation
of
a
serious
criminal
law,
that
is
indicative
of
the
type
of
expressive
activity
that
that
employee
will
engage
in
as
regards
to
the
function
of
the
agency
with
which
she
is
employed.
so
while
we
recognize
it's
a
more
difficult
case,
it's
not
a
case
that
the
court
has
to
decide
today.
but
we
still
would
be
willing
in
the
proper
circumstances
to
defend
it
before
this
court.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
once
again,
justice
marshall,
it
is
our
position
before
this
court
that--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
harm
in
this
case
is
to
the
government's
interest
in
promoting
the
public
understanding
and
respect
for
the
laws
of
the
constables.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
justice
marshall,
not
for
uniformity
of
thought,
but
for
understanding
about
the
requirements
of
the
law.
a
law
enforcement
agency
doesn't
just
engage
in
day-to-day
enforcement
activity.
it
doesn't
just
go
out
on
the
street
and
arrest
people
and
put
them
in
jail.
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
responsible--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--a
law
enforcement
agency
is
responsible
for
teaching
the
public
about
the
requirements
of
the
law,
for
emphasizing
their
importance.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
is
correct...
it
is
correct
that
this
statement
was
made
in
an
office.
it
was
made
after
an
announcement
on
the
radio
that
there
had
been
an
attempt
on
the
president's
life.
her
comment
was
overheard
by
a
deputy...
by
a
senior
deputy
constable
who
asked
her
if
she
meant
it.
by
her
testimony,
all
she
did
was
smile
at
him.
by
his
testimony,
she
said
she
meant
it.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
the
harm
at
that
stage
was
she
had
indicted
that
she
would
approve
of
violations
of
the
criminal
law.
the
constable
has
to
make
judgments
about
which
employees--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i'm
not
aware
of
a
law
which
prohibits--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i'm
sorry.
i
couldn't
understand.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
our
argument
would
be
the
same.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
in
fact,
it's
somewhat--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes.
in
fact,
it's
somewhat
unfortunate
for
us,
being
in
a
posture
before
this
court,
that,
in
fact,
it
was
a
statement
about
the
president
of
the
united
states
because
it
makes
it
a
less
attractive
case
for
the
government
to
be
enforcing.
it's
substantial--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
was
comparing
one
life
with
another.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
absolutely.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
you're
absolutely
right,
justice
scalia.
all
i
was
doing
in
responding
to
justice
stevens'
question
was
suggesting
in
terms
of
the
government--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--yes.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
to
the
extent
that
she
is
approving
a
violation
of
a
criminal
law--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--and
that
stealing
a
loaf
of
bread
would
constitute
a
violation
of
the
criminal
law,
yes.
the
governmental
interest
here
is
in
having
employees
of
law
enforcement
agencies
not
demean,
not
suggest
that
it
is
okay
to
violate
criminal
laws.
the
government...
and
it
is
a
little
odd
for
us
to
be
standing
here
pointing
to
justice
brandeis'
famous
dissent
in
homestead...
but,
nevertheless,
the
government
is
a
teacher.
the
law
enforcement
agency
is
the
principal
teacher
about
the
importance
of
complying
with
and
respecting
the
laws
that--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
pupils
in
this
case
are
her
fellow
employees,
one.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
was
she
ever
told--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--the
record
doesn't
reflect
it.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
no,
i
don't
believe
it
does.
chief
justice
rehnquist's--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--opinion
in
arnett
versus
kennedy
specifically
says...
in
a
context
of
public
employees
cases,
we
don't
need
a
detailed
code
of
procedure
and
substantive
rules.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that
is
true.
that
is
what
the
record
reflects,
and
we
have
no
reason
to
believe
otherwise.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes,
justice
marshall,
that's
true.
again,
though--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--we
would
say
that
she
could
be
discharged
for
that.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
yes.
once
again,
we
don't
believe
that
it--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--i
do
not
know
the
answer
to
that.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
i
certainly
cannot.
once
again,
we
think
that
the
government
interest
here
is
in
promoting
public
respect
for
and
understanding
of
the
law.
let
me
point
out
that
the
court
of
appeals
understood
that
in
this
case.
it
said
that
a
government
agency
is
entitled
to
employ
only
those
individuals
who
have
no
serious
reservations
about
the
mission
of
the
agency.
and
it
also
said
that
a
law
enforcement
agency
is
entitled
to
carry
out
its
mission
through
officers
who
do
not
favor
political
assassination.
but
the
court
of
appeals
said
that
for
some
reason,
because
she
performed
ministerial
duties,
that
the
government
had
no
interest
in
discharging
her.
we
suggest
that
that
just
misunderstands
the
governmental
interest
here.
the
governmental
interest
here
does
not
relate
to
the
particular
duties
that
she
was
performing.
rather,
it
extends
beyond
them.
it
extends
to
every
employee
of
the
agency,
because
it
extends
to
the
core
function
of
the
agency;
that
is,
of
enforcing
the
law,
of
promoting
respect
for
the
law,
teaching
the
public
about
the
law.
her
speech
demeans
that,
undermines
it,
and
is
inconsistent
with
the
function
that
the
agency
is
attempting
to
perform.
in
our
brief
we
gave--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--"that"
being?
mr.
glen
d.
nager
now,
as
i
tried
to...
in
response
to
justice
o'connor's
question...
say,
although
we
think
it
would
be
a
different
case,
we
would
be
willing
to
defend
it
on
the
theory
that
by
expressing
approval
of
such
a
serious
act
as
a
violation
of
a
criminal
law
as
approval
of
murder,
that,
in
fact,
that
would
be
an
indicator
that
a
public
employer
could
use
to
acknowledge
and
determine
that
this
employee
of
the
interior
department
is
not
one
who
would
carry
out
to
the
best
of
his
or
her
abilities
the
functions
of
the
interior
department.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
that's
a
good
question,
and
i
think
it
will
point
out,
hopefully,
a
good
part
of
our
answer
is
that
the
issue
is:
does
the
expressive
activity
indicate
that
that
employee
is
one
who
will
act
inconsistently
with
the
function
of
the
agency
today,
such
that
if
the
statement
could
be
reasonably
understood--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--no,
no,
not
at
all.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
we
did
not
at
all
suggest
that
this
individual
was
making
any
threat
on
the
life
of
the
president
or
that
she
was
actively
encouraging
anyone.
all
we're
suggesting
is:
the
question
is
whether
or
not
her
speech
can
be
reasonably
understood
as
expressing
approval
of
an
illegal
act--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--we
think
that...
i'd
have
to
say
that
we
would
think
that
she
could
be
discharged
for
that.
let
me
point
out...
before
my
time
is
up...
that
while
we
made
this
argument
in
our
brief
about
what
the
governmental
interest
is
here,
in
70
pages
of
briefing
by
respondent
and
their
amicus,
there
is
not
anything
which
answers
this
argument,
that
this
is
the
governmental
interest
that
the
constable
testified
he
was
trying
to
promote
and
that,
in
fact,
it
is
a
reasonable
judgment
for
the
public
employer
to
discharge
an
employee
for
engaging
in
this
type
of
expressive
activity.
mr.
glen
d.
nager
it
focused
on
the--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--right.
and
what
we're
suggesting
is--
mr.
glen
d.
nager
--and
we're
suggesting
that
this
is,
(a),
not
an
appropriate
inquiry
for
the
court
to
be
making,
that
that
is
something
in
the
discretion
of
the
employer,
the
employer
could
take
into
account
in
determining
whether
to
reprimand
her
or
discharge
her,
or
whatever.
but
the
employer
is,
in
fact,
promoting
the
government's
interests
when,
no
matter
what
level
the
employee
is
at,
the
employee
engages
in
expressive
activity
that
is
inconsistent
with
the
message
that
the
agency
is
supposed
to
be
sending
to
the
public.
that
any
employee
of
the
eeoc,
for
example,
who
expresses
her
approval
of
acts
of
employment
discrimination
undermines
the
eeoc's
efforts
to
teach
the
public
and
to
get
the
public
to
appreciate
the
importance
of
complying
with
the
employment
discrimination
laws.
that
any
employee
of
the
internal
revenue
service
who
expresses
approval
of
tax
fraud
or
tax
evasion
or
noncompliance
is
undermining
the
irs's
efforts
to
get
the
public
to
understand
the
importance
of
voluntarily
complying
with
laws.
our
legal
order
is
one
that
depends
critically
on
the
public
appreciating
and
voluntarily
complying
with
the
law
and
of
respecting
the
law.
when
the
law
enforcement
agency
itself...
any
of
its
employees
starts
expressing
their
approval
for
the
violations
of
those
laws,
it
undermines
the
agency's
ability
to
accomplish
the
function
with
which
it
is
assigned.
unless
the
court
has
further
questions.
