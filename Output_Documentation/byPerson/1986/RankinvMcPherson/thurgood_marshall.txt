thurgood
marshall
how
far
down?
justice
thurgood

does
the
woman
involved
here
do
other
than
what
every
other
computer
operator
does
in
the
united
states:
feed
material
in
by
punching
keys?
is
that
what
she
does?
she
punches
keys,
like
a
typewriter?

all
she
does?

else?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
mean,
you're
talking
about
the
whole
county
is
interested
in
what
she
does
and
all?
you
don't
really
mean
that,
do
you?
all
she
does
is
what...
how
many
people
punch
computers
in
harris
county,
would
you
estimate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
it
be
closer
to
thousands?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
think
we
have
a
misunderstanding
about
the
importance
of
the
job.
and
that's
what
i
want
to
hear
about.
what
does
she
do
that's
so
important
to
the
county,
to
the
state
and
to
the
united
states?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
page?
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
about
the
street
clean-up?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
just
what
harm
was
done
to
anybody
by
her
statement?
i
have
limited
this
to
anybody.
justice
thurgood
marshall
for
uniformity
of
thought?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
tell
me;
i
don't
know.
justice
thurgood
marshall
this
statement
was
made
in
an
office
where
nobody
was
there
but
employees
of
that
office,
and
it
doesn't
even
show
how
many
were
there.
it
only
shows
there
were
three
there.
now,
that
wrecks
the
world?
justice
thurgood
marshall
at
that
stage
what
was
the
harm
done?
justice
thurgood
marshall
was
she
ever
told
all
of
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that
she
is
a
minion
of
the
law
and
somebody
that
stands
for
this
and
that
and
should
conduct
herself
in
such
a
fashion
as
to
not
bring
disrepute
upon
this
office.
was
she
ever
told
that?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
don't
you
need
it
in
order
to
argue
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
yet
you
assume
it.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
didn't
say
"detailed".
i
just
said
"a
fact".
the
first
time
that
she
was
ever
told
that
it
was
wrong
to
do
this
was
when
the
man
asked
her.
that
was
the
first
time
in
this
record.
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
know
there
wasn't
any
other
reason.
justice
thurgood
marshall
suppose
she
had
advocated,
"somebody
ought
to
shoot
that
man
that
bumped
my
fender
this
morning?
"
justice
thurgood
marshall
really?
justice
thurgood
marshall
how
many
have
been
discharged
for
that
in
texas,
in
houston?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
can't
name
one?
justice
thurgood
marshall
we
don't
have
to
go
that
far,
that
she
intended
to
kill
the
president?
