mr.
billy
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
chronologically
developing
our
case,
on
january
12,
1981,
constable
rankin,
who
represents
one
of
the
eight
constable
precincts
in
harris
county
appointed
a
new
deputy,
ardith
mcpherson.
it
is
county
procedure
for
a
new
county
employee
to
be
on
a
90-day
probation
period
at
which
the
employee
and
the
employer
may
look
each
over
to
determine
whether
they
wish
to
extend
beyond
20
days
and
go
into
indeterminate
employment
there.
the
employment
period
that
began
on
january
12,
1981,
would
have
ended
on
april
12,
1981.
we
had
a
short
circuit
occur
though
in
that
occasion.
president
roosevelt...
not...
president
reagan
was
sworn
in
on
january
20
of--
[laughter]
either
one.
thank
you.
--on
january
20th
of
1981.
and
just
a
few
blocks
away
from
this
courthouse
now
on
march
30th
of
1981,
he
was
a
victim
of
an
assassination
attempt.
that
will
be
six
years
from
next
monday,
and
this
case
goes
on
and
on.
at
the
constables'
office,
business
was
going
on
as
usual.
his
new
deputy,
ardith
mcpherson,
had
been
assigned
primarily
in
her
initial
period
as
a
computer
operator.
let
me
explain
one
thing
about
our
constables
office.
our
downtown
constable
is
walter
rankin.
the
other
seven
constables
are
scattered
all
over
the
county
by
population
groupings
there.
but
they
are
not
around
the
downtown
courthouse
complex,
which
has
about
five
court
buildings
there
that
generate
all
of
the
court
process,
the
majority
of
the
court
process
that
goes
out
to
the
other
precincts
for
service.
the
new
system
which
we
call
jims...
justice
information
management
system...
all
of
the
process
throughout
the
county
comes
into
constable
rankin's
office,
and
it
is
put
onto
computers
which
plays
back
in
16
justice
of
the
peace
courts
scattered
over
the
county,
8
constables
offices
scattered
over
the
county,
the
district
clerk's
office
and
the
county
clerk's
office
both
across
the
street
from
him,
as
well
as
juvenile
information
goes
on
these
same
computers
there.
so
that
any
officer,
court
or
law
enforcement
who
is
wanting
to
know
at
any
particular
moment
the
status
of
service
of
process
in
any
of
these
cases
can
punch
it
up
on
the
computer
and
have
the
answer
right
there
before
him
as
to
what
attempts
have
been
made
on
service,
what
service
has
been
completed,
what
service
has
been
rejected
because
of
bad
addresses.
anyway,
the
information
is
readily
available
throughout
the
county,
based
upon
the
input
by
constable
rankin's
office
in
the
first
instance
before
he
sends
the
process
out
to
other
officers.
now,
when
constable
rankin
appointed
ardith
mcpherson
his
deputy,
he
did
this
under
a
statute
in
texas
that
says
that
all
of
the
constable's
employees
are
deputies.
he
is
not
authorized
to
employ
clerks,
people
to
answer
the
telephone,
people
to
do
the
typing.
everybody
that
he
employs
is
a
deputy
constable.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
i
did
not
hear
you,
sir.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
no,
sir,
it
does
not.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
all
right.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
the
man
who
sweeps
the
floor
in
the
constable's
office
is
not
employed
by
the
constable.
he's
employed
by
commissioners'
court
who
takes
care
of
all
of
the
courthouses.
but
everybody
who
the
constable
appoints--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--that
is--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--no,
we
won't
concede
that,
your
honor.
she
also
was--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--all
right.
for
one
hour
a
day
at
least,
she
answered
the
public
telephones
coming
into--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--that
is
all
at
this
point,
because
this
was
still
in
her
probation
period,
and
she
had
not
yet
actually
learned
that
job
yet.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
all
right.
it's
going
to
have
to
be
a
far
out
estimate,
your
honor.
i
would
make
a
guess
that
we
probably
have
three
to
five
hundred
people
who
do
it.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
it
may
very
well
be,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
all
right.
under
our
texas
law,
the
constable
employed
her.
she
is
a
deputy
constable,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
all
she
does
is
punch
in
information
on
her
computer.
if
she
did
not
do
that
part
of
the
constable's
duties,
he
himself
would
have
to
take
his
time
and
punch
in
that
information
there
because
that
assignment
was
made
for
him
to
handle
these
computer
inputs
in
the
first
instance
there.
so
one
of
his
deputies,
ms.
mcpherson,
was
doing
the
constable's
duties
to
the
extent
that
she
was
just
punching
in
information.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
which
could
have
been
the
case,
yes,
sir.
that
is
right,
because
he
would
then--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--he
would
have
employed
a
deputy
who
swept
the
floor
unless
there
were
some
changes
in
the
law
that
authorized
him
to
employ
the
floor
sweepers.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
that's
right.
all
right.
now,
we
have
a
constitutional
oath
in
texas
that
every
officer
elected
must
take,
and
every
officer
appointed
must
take,
and
deputy
mcpherson
took
this
oath
that
says
that
she
will
uphold
the
office
of
deputy
constable,
and
that
she
will
uphold
and
support
the
constitution
and
laws
of
the
united
states
and
of
the
state
of
texas.
now,
only
the
constable
was
elected.
in
the
metropolitan
area
that
is
harris
county,
which
has
about
20
percent
of
the
entire
population
of
the
state
of
texas
in
our
county
lines,
the
constable
himself
cannot
possibly
do
all
of
the
duties
that
the
legislature
has
placed
upon
him
by
statute
to
do.
for
one
thing,
at
the
time
of
this
case
we
had
about
160,000
pieces
of
process
come
through
his
office
for
channeling
out
to
the
other
constables.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
it
is
both,
your
honor.
it
is
generally
civil
process,
because
his
office
is
the
incoming
mailbox
for
all
of
the
other
253
counties
in
texas,
and
for
counties
and
courts
outside
of
the
state,
that
send
process
into
harris
county.
it
is
the
originator,
the
square
one
there
that
makes
all
of
the
rest
of
the...
and
he
has
more
computer
agents,
i
would
say,
in
his
one
office
than
all
of
the
other
seven
constables
put
together
there.
but
that
does
not
mean
that
he
does
all
of
the
work
there.
he
just
is
the
initial
inputter.
but
because
of
the
greater
litigation
area
in
his
precinct
there,
he
probably
handles
about
25
percent
of
all
of
the
service
process,
and
the
other
seven
handle
75
percent
of
it.
all
right.
now,
this
court
and
other
courts
throughout
the
state
and
the
nation
have
consistently
taken
the
viewpoint
that
the
constable
is
an
officer
of
the
court.
he
is
a
law
enforcement
officer.
in
texas
we
have
a
code
of
criminal
procedure
that
says
that
he
is
a
conservator
of
the
peace,
that
he
is
charged
with
suppressing
crime.
now
in
this
particular
instance
when
the
radio
in
the
computer
room
announced
that
an
attempt
was
made
to
assassinate
president
reagan,
it
apparently
has
failed,
and
he
is
being
pushed
into
a
car
and
leaving
the
scene.
and--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--she
was,
your
honor.
she
was
called
in
by
the
constable.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
yes,
sir.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
your
honor,
i
would
say
not,
based
upon
two
trials
that
we
have
been
through
in
the
district
court.
in
the
district
court,
captain
levrier
heard
ardith
mcpherson
say
that--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--no.
he
asked
her
that.
he
said
that
if
they
tried
for
the
president
again,
she
hoped
next
time
they
got
him.
and
he
went
over
to
her,
and
he
said,
"you
don't
really
mean
that".
she
said,
"yes,
i
do
mean
it.
"
so
then
through
channels
that
information
was
carried
to
constable
rankin
who
called
her
into
his
office
with
captain
levrier
there,
and
he
asked
her,
he
said,
"i
have
herd
of
a
statement
that
you
have
just
made.
"
"did
you
make
that
statement?
"
she
said
yes,
she
did
mean
it,
and--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--there
was
a
finding
by
the
district
court
in
both
trials,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
that
she
had
said
it
and
that
she
meant
it.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
in
the
end
of
the
trial
on
the
second
trial,
the
retrial,
the
court
announced
his
decision,
his
findings
of
fact
and
conclusions
of
law
from
the
bench.
and
in
those
he
does
make
the
declaration
there
in
the
joint
appendix,
back
toward
the
back
end
of
it,
that
he...
sir?
mr.
billy
e.
lee
i
do
not--
mr.
billy
e.
lee
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
billy
e.
lee
yes,
sir.
i'm
pleased
for
all
the
help
i
can
get,
your
honor.
[laughter]
i
will
cede
the
rest
of
my
time
to
the
solicitor
general.
