i
guess
it's
a
lucky
thing
then
that
the
constable
is
not
himself
responsible
for
keeping
the
courthouse
clean,
which
could
have
been
the
case.
i
mean,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--then
your
argument
would
indeed
extend
to
the
man
who
swept
the
floor;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
would
be
making
the
same
argument
here--
justice
antonin
scalia
--because
that
man
had
the
name
of
deputy?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
lee,
was
this
lady
fired
because
of
what
she
said
or
because
of
what
she
believed?
do
we
know
that?
i
mean,
suppose
when
she
was
called
in
by
the
constable
and
asked
whether
she
had
said
that,
she
said,
"yes,
i
said
it".
justice
antonin
scalia
i
know.
now,
suppose
she
had
said,
"yeah,
i
said
it,
but,
you
know,
i
didn't
really
mean
anything
by
it.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
whether
she
would
have
been
fired?
i
mean,
conceivably
you
might
fire
her
anyway
i
mean,
he
might
have
said,
"well,
you
know,
you
shouldn't
talk
like
that,
whether
you
mean
it
or
not.
"
"i
don't
want
that
kind
of
talk
in
my
law
enforcement
agency,
whether
you
mean
it
or
not.
"
"it
shows
poor
judgment,
and
you're
fired.
"
was
that
the
basis
for
his
dismissal?
justice
antonin
scalia
--she
really
meant
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't
really
know
that.
was
there
a
finding
to
that
effect?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
what?
justice
antonin
scalia
25a,
he
says,
"i
don't
believe
she
meant
nothing,
as
she
said
here
today.
"
"and
i
don't
believe
that
those
words
were
mere
political
hyperbole.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
all
he
says.
well,
certainly
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
thought
the
district
court
made
a
finding,
because
on
page
38a,
they
say,
"for
the
purpose
of
applying
the
pickering/connick
balancing
test,
we
accept
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
mcpherson
actually
hoped
that
the
president
would
be
assassinated.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
nager,
that's
what
we
have
here,
a
firing
because
of
what
she
said,
not
because
of
the
kind
of
person
she
was;
right?
it
wasn't
that
"i
don't
want
somebody
here
who
hopes
that
the
president
will
get
assassinated
the
next
time
successfully.
"
but
rather,
"i
don't
want
somebody
who
says
that
kind
of
thing.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
we
can.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
was
important
to
him.
he
asked
her
that,
didn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
don't
know.
i
mean,
surely
the
worse
the
crime
that
she's
willing
to
endorse,
the
worse
it
looks
for
her.
i
mean,
you--
justice
antonin
scalia
--know,
"i
hope
he
gets
away
with
that
$2.
"
doesn't
amount
to
the
same
thing
as
killing
somebody;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
likewise,
i
presume,
killing
al
capone
isn't
quite
as
bad
as
killing
the
president
in
the
scheme
of
what
is
considered
to
be
a
terrible...
i
mean,
what
amounts
to
an
attempt
to
bring
down
the
government;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
she
were
an
employee
in
the
interior
department,
that
would
be
okay
then;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
the
same
thing.
the
news
on
the
radio,
there's
an
attempted
assassination
on
the
president.
she
says,
"i
hope
they
get
him
next
time.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
your
theory
is
that
any
statement,
hyperbole
or
anything
else
that
occurs
during
the
course
of
a
political
discussion
like
that
gets
special
protection;
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
could
fire
an
employee,
i
take
it,
who
constantly
uses
profanity,
vulgar,
obscene
language
around
the
office,
but
not...
or
arguably
not,
you'd
have
to
meet
a
different...
a
substantially
different
burden,
if
he
only
uses
that
language
in
the
course
of
his
political
discussions?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
applying
the
test.
all
i'm
asking
you
is
whether
it's
a
different
test.
we
have
to
apply
one
test
to
vulgarity,
obscenity,
profanity
when
it's
just
used
generally.
but
a
totally
different
test...
and
we
have
to
see
if
it's
outweighed
by
some
governmental
interest...
if
that's
used
in
the
course
of
a
political
discussion.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
is
that?
i
mean,
part
of
my
problem
is:
i
don't
understand
how
broad
the
definition
of
the
discussion
has
to
be.
why
can't
we
just
look
at
this
one
sentence?
do
we
have
to
expand
it
to
look
at
the
whole
conversation?
i
don't
know--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no.
i'm
talking
about
whether
for
purposes
of
deciding
whether
this
was
a
part
of
a
statement
on
a
matter
for
public
concern--
justice
antonin
scalia
--we
have
to
look
at
the
whole
preceding
ten
minutes
of
her
conversation
or
we
can't
just
look
at
the
single
sentence?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
look
at
the
single
sentence,
you
would
acknowledge,
i
hope,
that
it
is
not
a
matter
of
public
concern,
that
we
don't
debate
on
whether
the
president
should
be
assassinated
or
not.
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
we
would
only
look
at
one
sentence--
justice
antonin
scalia
--many
of
which
were
meant.
justice
antonin
scalia
many
of
which
were
meant
literally.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
what
you're
saying
that
anybody
who
favors
assassinating
someone
is
disapproving
that
person?
i
mean,
i'll
stipulate
that.
but
doesn't
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
the
two
aren't
coextensive.
i
mean,
you
can
disapprove
of
someone
without
favoring
that
person's
assassination.
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
it's--
justice
antonin
scalia
--it
isn't
a
political
statement,
if
you
want
the
person's
assassination.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
it
wasn't
really
private.
i
mean,
she
may
have
thought
it
was
private,
but
that
was
part
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--by
captain
levrier,
who
was
offended
by
it,
and
it
might
have
offended
other
co-workers.
i
mean,
that
shows
some--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
if
you
rely
on
that,
then
you
are
conceding
that
she
reaffirmed
in
the
discussion
with
rankin,
not
only
that
she
had
said
it,
but
that
she
meant
it,
because
that's
what
that
testimony
refers
to?
"i
said
it,
and
i
meant
it.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
no.
but
that
excerpt
that
you
just
read
from
rankin's
testimony--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
his
testimony.
justice
antonin
scalia
if
you
rely
on
it,
you
have
to
accept
it
for
the
good
and
the
bad.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
a
secretary
in
the
clerk's
office
out
here
who,
you
know,
says
that?
"i
hope
the
next
time
they
go
for
the
president,
they
get
him.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it
comes
up
in
the
same
kind
of
a
conversation,
do
you
think
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--most
of
those
cases
involve
criminal
sanctions,
however,
rather
than--
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
kind
of
employees
a
public
employer
must
retain.
