justice
byron
r.
white
well,
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
something
more?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
says
there
has
to
be...
her
statement
not
only
has
to
be
inconsistent
with
the
mission
of
the
agency,
but
inconsistent
with
her
role
in
the
agency's
function.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
there
was
this
low-level
employee,
the
court
of
appeals
said
to
balances...
that
she
should
be
able
to
make
this
kind
of
a
political
speech.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
instance,
if
a
newspaperman
heard
about
this
statement
and
interviewed
her
on
television
and
said,
"do
you
really
think
that
you
would
like
to
see
him
killed
the
next
time?
"
"yes".
you
wouldn't
think
she
could
be
fired
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
may
be,
but
what's
your
answer?
do
you
know?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
he
says,
"what's
your
job"?
"i'm
a
deputy
constable".
"you're
sworn
to
obey
the
law?
"
"yes".
"do
you
think
the
president
should
be
killed?
"
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
there
was
no
finding
there
that
the
statement
was
actually
meant
and
was
seriously
made.
here
i
think
you
have
to
face
up
to
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
sustained
the
district
court's
finding--
justice
byron
r.
white
--and
interpreted
it
that
she
really
meant
it,
and
that
she
really
wished
the
president
would
be
killed.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
we
judge
the
case
as
though
she
really
meant
it
and
she
really
had
the
wish.
the
court
of
appeals
said
even
if
she
really
wished
it,
the
first
amendment
protects
her.
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
that
right?
justice
byron
r.
white
protected
her
from
being
fired?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
mr.
cutler--
justice
byron
r.
white
--this
lady
was
on
probation,
but
if
she
were
hired
permanently,
wouldn't
sooner
or
later
she
perform
the
other
duties
of
a
deputy
constable,
like
serving
process
and--
