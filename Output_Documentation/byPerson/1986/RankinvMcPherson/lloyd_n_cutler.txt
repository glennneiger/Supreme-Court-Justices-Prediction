mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
it's
common
grounds
in
this
case
that
mrs.
mcpherson's
remarks
were
not
among
the
classes
of
speech
which
can
constitutionally
be
branded
as
illegal.
they
were
not
libelous
or
obscene
or
fighting
words
or
a
threat
of
or
an
incitement
to
assassination
or
the
violent
overthrow
of
the
government.
there
are
really
two
disputed
issues.
the
first
is
whether
these
remarks
were
on
a
serious
matter
of
public
concern
and,
therefore,
on
the
highest
rung
of
the
ladder
of
first
amendment
values.
the
second
is
whether
the
balancing
test
of
the
pickering/connick
line
of
cases,
which
both
sides
accept
for
weighing
the
speech
of
public
employees.
mrs.
mcpherson's
right
to
speak
is
outweighed
by
the
governmental
interests
in
the
efficiency
of
the
public
service.
under
the
connick
test
we
accept
that
for
the
fifth
circuit's
views
to
be
upheld
in
this
court,
we
must
prevail
on
both
of
those
issues.
i'd
like
to
turn
first--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--i
think
that's
a
different
case,
justice
white.
this
is--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--my
answer
to
that
for
her
position
would
be
that
there
would
still
not
be
a
right
to
fire
her.
on
the
other
hand,
if
she
were
someone
who
faced
the
public...
an
fbi
officer,
a
cop
on
the
beat...
perhaps
it's
a
different
case.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
that
was
not
what
she
said.
i
don't
think
that's
close
to
what
she
said,
justice
white.
perhaps
that
gets
to
the
question
of
whether
she
was
addressing
an
issue
of
public
concern.
and
i
take
it,
although
the
solicitor
general
at
one
point
seems
to
dispute
this,
there
is
no
doubt
that
the
context
in
form
and
content
of
her
remarks
are
something
that
this
court
will
judge
for
itself,
because
this
is
a
mixed
question
of
constitutional
law
and
fact
in
a
first
amendment
case.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
quite
say
that
except
arguendo,
justice
o'connor.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes.
but
then
they
went
on
to
say--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--they
go
on
to
say,
a
sentence
or
so
later,
that
whether
her
remark
was
a
comment
on
the
president's
policies
or
an
actual
wish
for
her
assassination,
it
was
still
on
a
matter
of
public
concern;
and
that's
what
i'd
like
to
come
to
right
now.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
not
the
desirability
of
assassinating
the
president,
but
expressing
a
disapproval
of
the
president's
comments
in
terms
as
strong
and
as
ill-advised
as,
"if
they
try
it
again,
i
hope
they
get
him.
"
that
that
is
a
comment,
and
it's
the
only
way
it
can
be
understood
is
as
a
comment
on
the
president's
policies.
it
happened
to
be
that
the
conversation
occurred
at
the
very
moment
after
the
first
news
of
the
attempt
which,
under
the
first
report,
was
unsuccessful.
i
think
it's
perfectly
clear
that
if
she
had
been
in
a
discussion
of
the
president's
policies,
the
administration's
policies,
the
day
before,
she
never
would
have
uttered
that
comment.
if
it
had
been
weeks
later,
it's
most
unlikely
that
she
would
have
uttered
that
comment.
it
was
a
comment
that
was
simply
evoked
by
the
circumstances,
the
shock
of
the
report
which
everybody
feels.
and
once
she
heard
that,
she
used
that
figure
of
speech
in
expressing
her
disapproval.
when
you
make
an
examination
of
what
she
actually
said,
as...
and
this
is
undisputed
testimony...
she
begins
by
saying,
after
this
first
news,
"it
must
have
been
a
black
who
did
it.
"
to
her
colleague
at
the
next
desk
to
whom
she
has
since
been
married.
she
then
says...
she
makes
comments
about
the
president's
policies
on
food
stamps,
on
ceta,
on
public
welfare
programs;
and
her
colleague
at
the
next
desk
agrees
with
her.
and
then
she
says...
and
that
happens
to
be
at
the
very
moment
when
captain
levrier
is
walking
up...
"the
next
time
they
try
it,
i
hope
they
get
him.
"
in
its
context,
there
isn't
the
slightest
question
that
that
remark
is
a
remark
in
the
course
of
a
discussion
of
the
political...
of
administration
policies,
and
that
the
reference
to
"if
they
try
it
again,
i
hope
they
get
him.
"
was
clearly
something
evoked
by
the
emotion
of
the
moment.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
would
say
that
gets
special
protection.
i
would
still
agree
it
has
to
be
weighed
in
a
pickering/connick
balance
for
a
public
employee.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
if
he
uses
obscene
language,
you
said,
i
believe,
justice
scalia,
commonly
or
regularly
that
might
affect
employee
morale
or
efficiency,
it
might
well
be
someone
who
went
around
even
in
the
context
of
a
political
discussion--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--if
it
is
part
of
a
discussion
on
a
political
issue
or
meant
to
be
an
expression
on
a
political
expression,
it
has
to
be
weighed.
it
may
turn
out
to
be
obscene,
in
which
case
it
can
be
banned.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
we're
now
in
the
context,
i
take
it,
of
can
this
discussion
be
prohibited
or
punished?
or
are
you
speaking
solely
of
public
employees?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--not
a
political
issue.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
think
you
have
to
look
at
the--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--we
certainly
don't
debate
on
whether
the
president
should
be
assassinated,
and
i
deplore
myself
any
such
statement.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
a
statement,
"if
they
try
it
again,
i
hope
they
get
him.
"
is
clearly,
by
any
standard,
an
expression
of
her
disapproval
of
the
individual.
it
is
not
a
general
endorsement
of
violence,
assassination
or
anything
like
that.
it's
an
extreme,
immoderate,
foolish,
excessive
comment
about
a
matter
of
public
concern;
namely,
the
policies
of
that
individual.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
and
it
happens
all
the
time.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
yes,
i
do
think
there
is.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
you're
still
on
the
issue
of
whether
this
is
a
matter
of
public
concern,
it
is
clearly
something,
number
one,
that
cannot
legally
be
punished
or
prohibited.
and,
number
two,
if
it
is
with
reference
to
an
individual,
and
there
were
many
similar
statements,
no
doubt
at
the
time
of
the
attempt
on
governor
george
wallace,
at
the
time
of
the
successful
assassination
of
dr.
martin
luther
king,
at
the
time
when
jack
ruby
shot
lee
harvey
oswald,
there
were
many,
many
people--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--huh?
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
may
have
been
meant,
but
they
were
expressions,
not,
"we're
all
for
assassination".
they
were
expressions
of
how
that
individual
thought
about
the
policies
or
the
actions
of
the
victim.
that's
what
they
were.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
do
believe
it
takes
it
out
of
the
context
of
favoring
assassination
as
such.
i
would
remind
you
also--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--that's
right.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
of
course
you
can.
it
is
an
excessive,
immoderate
way
of
making
a
political
statement
is
what
it
is.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
and
it
cannot
be--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--well,
certainly
in
the
context
here,
it
was
a
political
statement.
i
believe
you
began
this
line
of
questioning
by
inquiring,
"do
we
have
to
look
at
all
the
sentences?
"
in
claiborne
hardware
there
was
a
reference
in
the
long
impassioned
speech
by
mr.
evers,
the
boycott
organizer,
in
which
he
said
that
"if
we
catch
you
in
those
stores
which
are
to
be
boycotted,
we'll
break
your
necks;
and
there
won't
be
any
white
policemen
around
in
the
middle
of
the
night
to
help
you.
"
but
because
it
was
in
the
middle
of
a
long
impassioned
speech,
the
bulk
of
which
was
about
promoting
the
success
of
the
boycott,
it
was
held...
just
as
the
remarks
in
the
watts
case
were
held...
to
be
political
hyperbole.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
there
was
no
finding--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--she
was
expressing
at
most
a
hope
that
if
it
happened
again...
she
was
not
urging
assassination,
she
was
not
threatening
it
herself
most
certainly...
she
was
stating
her
opposition
to
the
president's
policies
in
this
extreme
and
immoderate
form,
"if
they
try
it
again,
i
hope
they
get
him.
"
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that
is
correct.
but
in
the
very
next
sentence,
as
i
mentioned,
justice
rehnquist...
i
think
it's
the
very
next
paragraph...
the
court
of
appeals
says,
in
suggesting
that
that
finding
is
an
arguendo
finding,
that
whether
she
was
expressing
opposition
to
the
president's
policies
or
an
actual
wish
for
his
assassination,
her
remarks--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--well,
there's
no
question
that--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--that
is
right.
there's
no
question
that
the
first
amendment
protects
it
from
the
standpoint
of
enjoining--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--that
gets
us
to
the
pickering/connick
balancing
test,
i
think.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
don't
believe
you
have
to...
i
think
it
is
clear
this
was
political
hyperbole,
and
you
are
obliged,
i
think,
to
examine
it
yourself.
it
was
the
fourth
or
fifth
sentence
in
a
series
that
began,
as
i
said,
"it
must
have
been
a
black
who
did
it.
"
a
discussion
of
the
president's
policies,
which
she
and
her
neighbor
at
the
next
desk
disapproved,
and
then
this
extreme
final
sentence
which
happens
to
be
the
one
that
was
overheard.
may
i
continue,
if
i
can,
with
the
balancing
test
issue
which
i
think
really
is
the
most
important
issue?
we
think
that
mrs.
mcpherson's
firing
cannot
be
justified
under
the
pickering/connick
test.
and
in
asking
you
to
weigh
this,
bear
in
mind
that
there
are
some
15
million
public
employees.
that's
approximately
15
percent
of
the
work
force.
it's
our
best
guess
there
are
some
5
million
law
enforcement
employees,
of
whom
perhaps
one
million...
that's
a
figure
we
know
more
solidly...
are
in
the
criminal
justice
system.
it
was
not...
i
hope
i
have
carried
you
that...
properly
understood
as
political
hyperbole
as
in
watts,
where
the
statement,
as
you'll
recall,
was...
by
someone
opposed
to
the
draft.
"if
they
put
a
rifle
in
my
hands,
the
first
man
i
hope
to
get
in
my
sights
is
lbj.
"
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
would
hope
watts
is
still
good
law,
justice.
i
believe
it
still
is,
and
i
believe
that's
conceded
by
the
government,
at
least
which
concedes
you
could
not
criminalize
this
statement.
it
regards
watts
simply
as
a
construction
of
the
statute
about
threats
to
the
president,
but
i
think
an
examination
of
the
opinion
would
clearly
show
it's
on
constitutional
grounds.
it
was
not
as
in
connick
one
remark
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
among
many
other
remarks
which
were
about
the
affairs
of
the
office.
it
was
a
private,
rather
than
a
public,
remark.
she
didn't
stand
up
on
a
table
and
make
this
remark.
she
didn't
have
a
poster
behind
her
desk
or
anything
like
that.
that,
as
you
held
in
the
givhan
case,
the
fact
that
it
was
private,
does
not
take
it
out
of
the
category
of
comment
on
a
matter
of
public
concern.
most
public
speech
in
this
country
is
private.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
it
happened
to
get
overheard
by
one
person;
that's
quite
right.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that's
what
i...
i
believe
i'll
show
in
a
moment,
justice
scalia,
she
was
not
fired
on
the
ground
that
it
offended
anyone
else,
or
that
it
affected
discipline
or
morale
in
the
office.
it
was
the
constable's
loss
of
confidence
in
her
that
was
his
basis
for
firing
her,
and
as
i'll
try
to
get
to
in
a
moment
in
response
to
your
earlier
question
to
mr.
lee,
it
was
based
more
on
her
beliefs
than
anything
else.
in
connick's
words
it
was
"speech
as
a
citizen",
and
not
as
an
employee.
the
fact
that
it
occurred
in
the
workplace
was
certainly
not
a
matter
of
deliberate
choice
on
her
part.
all
of
us,
when
we
heard
that
news,
were
frozen
in
place
wherever
we
were
and
whatever
emotional
response
we
had
to
the
event
was
going
to
come
out
wherever
we
were.
it
was
not
intended
to,
and
it
did
not
cause,
what
connick
called
a
mini-insurrection
in
the
office.
it
was
private.
it
wasn't
meant
to
be
overheard.
it
wasn't
voicing
a
grievance
as
an
employee,
but
a
grievance
as
a
citizen.
constable
rankin
conceded
that
it
had
no
effect
on
office
efficiency
or
discipline,
and
the
coiurt
of
appeals
found
that.
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
office
business
or
the
personnel
or
the
mission
of
the
office.
there
was
no
other
reason
for
the
finding...
for
the
firing
on
which
a
court
could
have
relied,
as
in
the
mt.
healthy
case.
and
rankin
conceded
that
this
was
the
reason.
and
what
he
said
was,
"i
did
not
base
my
action
on
whether
the
work
was
interrupted
or
not.
"
"i
based
my
statement...
my
action,
on
a
statement
that
was
made
to
me
direct.
"
"right
then
was
when
i
lost
confidence
in
her.
"
that's
at
page
86,
i
think,
of
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
what
the
district
court
found
is
by
word
or
deed...
the
district
court
never
found,
as
i
think
justice
o'connor
pointed
out
earlier,
that
she
said,
"yes,
i
meant
it".
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that's
his
testimony.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
that's
right.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
rely
on
it
to...
well,
the
district
court
made
its
findings.
i
don't
think
it's
important
whether
she
said,
"yes,
i
mean
it",
or
not.
and
we
do
have
a
finding
below
that
by
word
or
deed,
she
meant
it.
i
ask
you:
looking
at
the
conversation
in
context,
though,
to
conclude
that
even
if
she
meant
it,
it
was
still
political
hyperbole
of
the
type
which
mr.
evers
in
the
claiborne
hardware
case...
where
i
don't
believe,
and
i
was
in
that
case...
there
was
any
issue
as
to
whether
he
meant
it,
other
than
as
political
hyperbole.
the
critical
point
there
was:
it
was
part
of
a
much
larger
speech,
and
that
no
violent
acts
occurred
after
the
speech
was
made.
so
that
a
finding
of
intimidation
in
the
lower
courts...
unlawful
intimidation
was
not
justified.
the
fact
that
the
constable's
office
is
a
law
enforcement
agency,
rather
than
some
other
place
of
public
employment,
we
don't
think
changes
the
balance
here.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
well,
to
begin
with,
perry
against
sindermann
holds
even
for
employees
lacking
tenure...
i
believe
that's
a
teacher's
case...
that
there
is
an
economic
expectation
even
for
probationary
employees.
but,
in
addition,
to
allow
all
of
the
supervisors
of
public
employees
in
the
country
a
broad
discretion
to
fire
people,
even
probationary
people,
based
on
their
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
is
giving
a
very
wide
discretion.
there
are
considerable
doubts
about
any
statute...
let
us
say
a
modern
version
of
the
alien
and
sedition--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--i
would
say,
justice
o'connor,
that
it
is
a
very
dangerous
power
to
grant
just
on
the
distinction
between
the
probationary
employee
and
the
employee
or
this
person,
let
us
say,
a
month
later
after
her
probationary
status
was
over.
any
form
of
government
sanction,
based
on
judgments
about
the
beliefs
of
an
employee,
at
the
very
least
ought
to
be
supported
by
statutes
and
rules,
as
professor
bickel
said.
the
only
thing
that
saved
the
civil
service
rules
in
arnett
against
kennedy
was
a
long
period
of
interpretation
and
regulations
so
that
employees
knew
what
to
expect,
for
to
allow
all
the
supervisors
in
the
country
to
decide
on
the
basis
of
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern,
"i
don't
like
the
president,
i
disapprove
of
his
policies.
"
to
go
get
somebody
else,
i
should
think
would
be
a
very
dangerous
thing.
you
have
ruled
several
times
in
elrod
against
burns,
in
branti
against
finkel,
where
you
had
public
employees
who
were
not
on
probationary
status.
you
had
a
deputy
sheriff
in
elrod.
you
had
a
public
defender
in
branti.
you
said
in
neither
case
could
they
be
fired
on
the
basis
of
their
political
beliefs.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
if
it
is
made
on
the
basis
of
their
suitability
to
hold
the
particular
job
that
they
are
doing,
i
would
say
yes.
if
this
same
remark
had
been
made...
let
us
say
by
an
fbi
employee
in
justice
white's
case
on
television,
i
would
say
yes,
that
person
could
be
fired.
but
for
the
janitor,
for
the
computer
punch
operator...
and
there
are
millions
of
them
around
the
country,
and
we
know--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--well,
i
would
think
you
would
at
least
deliberate,
justice
scalia,
and
learn
the
full
text
of
the
conversation
and
have
something,
for
example,
in
the
area--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--it
may
very
well
be
that
this
court
is
a
place
of
confidential...
it
certainly
is
a
confidential
place
which
takes
you
out
of
this
line
of
cases,
and
you
might
be
free
to
do
it
there.
she
was
not
performing
a
confidential
job
or
a
policymaking
job.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
suppose
the
janitor
in
the
court
had
said
it.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
i
doubt
it
very
much.
you
have
the
testimony
of
mr.
jackson
in
the
record.
he
served
in
that
office
for
three
or
four
years.
and
so
far
as
i
know,
he
never
had
any
job
different
in
terms
of
confidentiality
than
the
job
he
had...
that
they
both
had
at
this
time.
i
think
the
last
points
i
would
like
to
make
are
that
the
solicitor
general's
professionalism
test
and
the
constable's
test
of
losing
confidence
are
not
constitutionally
adequate
justifications
for
firing,
based
on
speech
relating
to
matters
of
public
concern.
and
i
would
submit
to
you
that
no
statute
containing
that
sort
of
a
vague
standard,
"whenever
the
supervisor
loses
confidence",
or
finds
that
in
his
judgment
the
employee
is
unprofessional
would
be
sustained
as
to
a
matter
of
speech
on
a
subject
of
public
concern.
suppose
that
you
had
a
new
alien
and
sedition
law
which
was
limited
to
the
15
million
public
employees,
or
even
the
5
million
law
enforcement
employees.
and
the
only
sanction
for
speaking
ill
of
the
president
or
the
government
or
bringing
them
into
disrepute
was
loss
of
job.
could
a
statute
like
that
possibly
be
sustained
today?
i
would
submit
to
you,
in
new
york
times
against
sullivan
at
least
that
it
could
not.
approving
mrs.
mcpherson's
discharge,
it
seems
to
us,
opens
up
an
orwellian
prospect
of
standardless
firing
by
supervisors
for
speech
on
matters
of
public
concern,
for
political
expressions
and
even
beliefs.
we
think
it
would
go
far
beyond
any
first
amendment
case
that
you
have
ever
decided,
even
those
written
under
the
stress
of
the
war
and
the
mcarthur
era.
and
even
those
cases
where
you
sustained
a
restriction
on
speech
and
belief,
almost
all
of
them
were
based
on
some
statute
or
regulation
passed
by
the
majority
of
some
legislature
in
setting
some
standard,
rather
than
on
the
discretion,
without
any
regulation
at
all,
of
hundreds
or
thousands
of
supervisors.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
some.
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
some,
like
american
communications
workers
against
dowd,
just
involve
simply
loss
of
a
union
position
and
nothing
more.
justice
jackson--
mr.
lloyd
n.
cutler
--it
was
upheld
over
justice
jackson's
dissent.
and
i
would
just
like
to
close
by
reading
one
sentence
from
his
dissent,
or
one
paragraph.
"i
think
that
under
our
system,
it
is
time
enough
for
the
law
to
lay
hold
of
the
citizen
when
he
acts
illegally
or
in
some
rare
circumstances
where
his
thoughts
are
given
illegal
utterance.
"
i
think
we
must
let--
