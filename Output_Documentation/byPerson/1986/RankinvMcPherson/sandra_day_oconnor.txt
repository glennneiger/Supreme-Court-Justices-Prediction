no,
that
isn't
correct,
is
it?
tell
me
where
you
find
in
the
district
court
findings
a
decision
either
way
on
whether
she
meant
it.
i
didn't
find
it.
can
you--
--i
didn't
either.
--tell
me
what
finding
it
is?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
the
result
be
different
in
some
other
kind
of
public
officer,
mr.
nager?
let's
say
the
clerk's
office
as
opposed
to
the
constable's?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yeah,
where
papers
are
filed.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
about
the
garbage
service?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
we
accept
the
case,
mr.
cutler,
on
the
statement
of
the
court
of
appeals
that
mcpherson
actually
hoped
the
president
would
be
assassinated?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
the
court
says,
"we
accept
the
district
court's
conclusion
that
mcpherson
actually
hoped
that
the
president
would
be
assassinated.
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
do
we
decide
the
case
on
that
basis?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cutler,
this
was
a
probationary
employee.
do
you
suppose
there's
any
reason
at
all
why
the
employer
of
a
probationary
employee
could
not
determine
that
the
employer
would
keep
as
employees
in
the
office
only
people
the
employer
could
trust
and
had
confidence
in,
that
they
would
be
sensible
people
who
could
deal
properly
with
the
public
in
a
public
office,
and
then
judge...
make
that
judgment
on
the
basis
of
perfectly
protected
speech,
but
conclude
the
fact
that
the
person
thinks
the
way
the
employee
thinks
and
says
what
she
says
indicates
to
me
that
person
doesn't
merit
a
permanent
job?
what's
the
matter
with
that?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
my
question
is
whether
speech
on
a
matter
of
public
concern
can
evidence
character
traits
of
the
employee
that
would
justify
the
employer
from
saying,
"i
don't
think
this
person
merits
permanent
employment.
"
do
you
think
that
can't
be
done
in
the
public
sector?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
can
they
be
fired
because
they
exhibit
character
traits
and
an
inability
to
reason
adequately
to
serve
in
the
job
of
public
employment,
even
though
that
judgment
is
made
in
part
by
speech
that
could
be
protected?
