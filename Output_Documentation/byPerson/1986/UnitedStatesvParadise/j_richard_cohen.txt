mr.
j.
richard
cohen
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
at
the
time
the
one
for
one
promotion
requirement
was
entered
in
this
case
three
alternative
remedies
had
already
failed.
the
first
remedy
was
imposed
in
1970
in
a
case
called
united
states
v.
frazier.
it
was
a
remedy
imposed
against
the
department
of
personnel,
one
of
the
defendants
in
this
case.
it
was
a
simple
injunction,
an
injunction
that
enjoined
it
from
discriminating.
because
the
department
of
personnel
administers
the
alabama
merit
law,
the
injunction
applied
across
the
board
to
all
alabama
state
agencies.
in
1972
the
district
court
found
that
at
least
as
far
as
the
state
troopers
were
concerned
the
injunction
had
been
ignored.
in
the
face
of
such
a
blatant
violation
it
ordered,
among
other
things,
the
one
for
one
hiring
requirement.
the
district
court
hiring
requirement
stays
into
effect
or
lasts
until
25
percent
of
the
trooper
force
as
a
whole
is
black.
it
is
not
limited
to
the
entry
level
rank
because
the
judge
felt
that
the
defendant's
discrimination
could
not
be
so
neatly
characterized
as
being
limited
to
hiring.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
yes.
in
1979,
in
spite
of
the
fact
that
the
1972
decree
was
designed
to
provide
an
impetus
to
promote
blacks,
not
a
single
black
had
been
promoted.
this
time,
however,
the
parties
provided
a
solution,
a
consent
decree
that
was
entered
by
the
district
court.
it
was
a
partial
decree.
it
did
not
disturb
the
prior
orders
that
had
been
entered
in
the
case.
instead,
it
provided
a
mechanism
by
which
blacks
could
finally
advance
within
the
ranks
of
the
alabama
state
troopers.
in
1983
the
district
court
found
that
the
third
remedy
had
failed
miserably.
the
alabama
state
troopers
were
still
without
any
acceptable
promotion
procedures,
and
according
to
the
district
court
it
did
not
appear
that
they
would
have
any
such
procedures
in
the
near
future.
the
solicitor
general
writes
to
this
court
that
there
was
no
history
of
recalcitrance
by
the
time
1983
came,
that
the
department
of
public
safety,
the
alabama
state
troopers
had
made
a
generous
offer
of
20
percent
in...
right
prior
to
the
enforcement
action
beginning
in
1983.
these
statements
don't
stand
scrutiny.
the
20
percent
offer
to
which
the
solicitor
referred
was
not
intended
to
be
an
offer
that
recognized
that
the
decree
had...
that
the
promotion
procedure
had
an
adverse
impact.
it
was
designed
to
instead
temporarily
postpone
the
day
of
reckoning.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
when
the
plaintiffs
brought
the
point
out
in
the
district
court
that
the
20
percent
offer
had
been
made,
the
defendants
objected
and
said
it
was
a
confidential
settlement
offer.
the
solicitor
also
indicates
that
the
system
that
was
adopted
after
the
consent
degree
was
entered
was
no
different
than
the
system
that
was
in
place
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
court's
december
15,
1983,
order.
that
is
false.
the
offer
on
the
table
was
a
one-time
proposal,
a
one
time
proposal
to
promote
eleven
whites
and
four
blacks.
it
was
a
proposal
that
was...
the
numbers
were
generated,
i
suppose,
as
an
attempt
to
modestly
comply
with
the
requirement
that
there
be
no
adverse
impact,
but
the
numbers
were
not
generated
by
any
sort
of
procedure
or
any
sort
of
selection
procedure
that
was
in
place.
the
numbers
to
which
the
solicitor
points
after
the
promotion
order
was
entered
were
numbers
that
came
about
through
the
department's
attempt
to
come
up
with
promotion
procedures
that
complied
with
its
requirements
under
the
decree.
the
department
represents
that
the
promotion
procedures
comply
with
the
decree,
and
the
promotion
procedures
that
they
have
adopted
are
far
different
than
the
promotion
procedures
that
they
had
at
the
time
the
order
was
entered.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
no,
your
honor.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
that
is
not
what
we
proposed
in
the
district
court.
i
think
there
would
be
a
significant
difference.
if
all
the
promotions
had
gone
to
blacks,
then
it
would
have
been
the
case
that
white
state
troopers
would
have
had
to
perhaps
wait
an
awfully
long
time
in
order
to
have
another
chance
to
even
compete
for
promotional
opportunities.
the
district
court's
order,
on
the
other
hand,
leaves
white
troopers
with
the
opportunity
to
compete
at
worst
for
at
least
half
of
the
promotional
opportunities
or
the
promotion
positions
available.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
excuse
me?
i
am
so
sorry.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
i
think
that
four
to
one
would
have
been
excessive
given
the
district
court's
experience.
the
one
for
one--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--i
think
the
district
court
had
to
carefully
balance
the
competing
interests
at
stake,
on
the
one
hand
the
need
to
enforce
the
department's
consent
decree
obligations,
and
on
the
other
hand
the
need
to
minimize
any
burden
imposed
on
whites.
the
court
chose
the
one
for
one
requirement
for
essentially
two
reasons.
the
one
for
one
requirement
had
existed
at
the
hiring
level
for
quite
some
time.
the
requirement
had
proven
effective.
it
had
also
proven
to
be
manageable.
in
addition,
the
district
court
looked
to
this
court's
opinion
in
webber,
an
opinion
that's...
albeit
in
a
different
context,
to
see
what
type
of
burden,
or
to
seek
guidance
on
what
type
of
burden
could
be
permissibly
imposed.
the
one
for
one
promotion
requirement
that
the
district
court
did
impose
also
was
far
better
suited
to
the
situation
that
confronted
it
for
two
reasons.
first,
it
compensated
the
beneficiaries
of
the
department's
consent
decree
commitments
for
the
department's
delay.
secondly,
it
provided
a
mechanism
designed
to
ensure
that
the
intolerable
situation
that
confronted
the
district
court
would
not
reoccur.
if
the
department...
if
the
department
had
simply
been
enjoined
to
do
what
it
was
supposed
to
do
all
along,
there
would
be
no
incentive
to
end
its
footdragging.
now,
the
solicitor
does
suggest
that
there
were
a
variety
of
nonracial
alternatives
that
the
district
court
could
have
imposed.
for
example,
he
mentions
contempt
or
threatening
the
department
with
the
prospect
of
taking
over
its
operations
through
the
appointment
of
an
administrator.
whether
these
types
of
procedures
would
have
served
the
purpose
of
the
district
court
order
in
ensuring
future
compliance
with
the
consent
decree
is
a
matter,
of
course,
where
opinions
might
differ.
nevertheless,
two
points
are
clear.
the
district
court
entered
its
order
only
after
carefully
reviewing
the
failure
of
prior
orders
in
this
case
to
make
the
alabama
department
of
public
safety
finally
promote
black
troopers.
secondly,
none
of
the
so-called
plentiful
nonracial
alternatives
that
the
solicitor
general
puts
forward
here
were
ever
presented
to
the
district
court.
not
a
single
one
of
them.
now,
this
court
should
not
underestimate
the
ingenuity
of
litigants
to
think
of
new
nonracial
alternatives
after
the
fact
given
that
the
district
court
here
had
a
firm
basis
and
a
reasoned
basis
for
adopting
its
race-conscious
remedy.
sanctioning
the
solicitor
general's
approach
here
would
mean
that
litigation
like
this
would
never
come
to
an
end.
defendants
with
an
egregious
record
of
discrimination
would
have
incentives
to
delay,
and
appellate
courts,
not
having
the
benefit
of
the
parties
before
it
or
familiarity
with
the
record
will
always
be
required
to
second
guess
district
court
judgments.
in
addition--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--no.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
the
district
court
had
competing
interests
at
stake.
the
matter
of
choosing
a
ratio,
there
can't
be
any
type
of
mathematical
precision
to
it,
as
this
court
has
recognized
on
many
occasions.
the
district
court's
choice
of
one
for
one
was
by
no
means
arbitrary.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
because
it
had
proven
effective
and
manageable
in
the
past.
second,
the
district
court--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--that's
correct.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
there
is
a
difference,
and
the
court
in
sheetmetals,
of
course,
pointed
out
once
or
twice,
i
think
that
it
was
not
dealing
there
with
a
burden
that
was
imposed
on
existing
employees.
nevertheless,
the
court
has
not
adopted
any
sort
of
per
se
rule
that
says
that
no
race
conscious
orders
can
be
entered
at
the
promotion
level.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
there
are
a
number
of
other
purposes
that
the
district
court's
one
for
one
order
serve.
again,
the
district
court's
one
for
one
order
was
designed
to
provide
a
mechanism
to
ensure
future
compliance.
it
was
designed
to
give
the
department--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--justice
o'connor,
i
don't
know
if
the
term
in
terrorem
aids
the
analysis.
the
order
was
definitely
designed
to
compel
the
department
of
public
safety--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--the
order
was
carefully
crafted
in
that
regard.
it
said
that
the
one
for
one
requirement
never
would
operate
in
the
absence
of
objectively
qualified
blacks.
the
record
before
this
court
indicates
that
the
department
has
been
allowed
to
make
promotions
to
the
lieutenant
and
the
captain's
level
and
promote
only
whites
because
the
court
and
the
parties
have
accepted
its
representation
that
at
least
for
now
and
because
of
its
prior
history
of
discrimination
there
are
no
black
troopers
in
the
ranks
of
the
alabama
state
trooper
force
that
are
objectively
qualified.
so,
the
order
has
built-in
safeguards
to
ensure
that
no
unqualified
troopers--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--the
order
would
not
survive
if
it
mandated
the
promotion
of
numerous
unqualified
persons.
i
don't
disagree.
the
one
for
one
requirement
was
not
pegged.
it
did
not...
was
not
explicitly
related
to
the
percentage
of
black
persons
that
took
the
corporal's
examination
in
1981.
that's
correct.
in
addition
to
not
requiring
the
promotion
of
anyone
who
was
unqualified,
the
one
for
one
requirement
does
not
compel
any
unnecessary
promotions.
it
is
a
limited
remedy,
a
conditional
one.
it
applies
only
in
the
event
that
the
department
fails
to
abide
by
its
obligations,
and
then
only
in
the
event
that
blacks
do
not
represent
25
percent
of
the
troopers
at
a
given
rank.
the
order
here
only
has
a
minimal
impact
on
the
interests
of
white
troopers.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
yes,
in
february
of
1980,
ten
corporals
were
promoted,
six
whites
and
four
blacks,
pursuant
to
a
side
agreement
entered
simultaneously
with
the
decree.
in
addition,
white
troopers
had
been
promoted
among
the
upper
ranks,
for
example,
from
corporal
to
sergeant,
from
sergeant
to
lieutenant,
lieutenant
to
captain,
captain
to
major.
so
while
the
department
was
continually
promoting
persons
in
its
upper
ranks--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--i
am
not
sure.
i
don't...
at
the
time
that
it
was
entered
into
it
obviously
appeared
to
be
a
good
deal.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
there
were
no
whites
who
were
promoted
from
the
position
of
corporal
other
than
the
ten
persons
promoted
at
the
time
right
after
the
consent
decree
was
entered.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
yes.
thank
you,
chief
justice.
again,
i
would
point
out,
however,
that
the
1979
consent
decree
was
designed...
it
was
not
the
first
time
that
the
issue
of
promotion
had
come
up
in
this
case.
of
course,
black
troopers
in
1972
never
had
the
luxury
of
being
discriminated
against
at
the
level
of
promotion.
there
were
no
black
troopers,
and
it
wasn't
because
the
department
of
public
safety
just
happened
to
be
using
a
test
that
was
not
validated
and
happened
to
screen
all
of
them
out.
it
happened
to
be
the
case...
it
happened
because
it
operated
a
pervasive
system
of
discrimination.
because
of
that,
judge
johnson
in
1972
applied
the
25
percent
figure
to
the
trooper
force
as
a
whole.
he
explained
in
1979
that
the
reason
he
did
that
was
to
provide
an
impetus
to
promote
blacks.
justice
powell's
opinion
on
wygant,
for
example,
indicates
that
the
school
board
there
perhaps
to
serve
its
interests
could
have
chosen
something
more
narrow,
something
that
had
less
of
an
impact.
they
could
have
chosen
a
hiring
quota
rather
than
the
layoff
procedure
that
it
did
employ.
well,
in
this
case
the
hiring
quota
has
already
been
implemented
and
it
has
proven
ineffective
to
provide
an
impetus
to
the
department
to
promote
blacks.
because
of
that
the
parties
entered
into
their
consent
decree
commitments
and
in
1983
those
commitments
were
the
ones
that
the
district
court
found
that
the
department
had
not
fulfilled.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
no,
it
would
not,
for
two
reasons.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
just
like
the
eleven
to
four
proposal,
the
eleven
to
four
one-time
offer
that
the
district
court
rejected
in
1983,
a
proposal
that
simply
reiterated
the
department's
consent
decree
commitments
would
have
done
nothing
to
compensate
for
the
department's
delay
and
it
would
not
have
provided
some
sort
of
mechanism
to
compel
the
department
to
comply
with
its
obligations
in
the
future.
in
addition
to
only
having--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--justice
o'connor,
it
is
impossible
to
say
in
retrospect
whether
or
not
that
would
have
worked.
the
district
court
here
did
have
a
firm
basis
for
ruling
that
some
sort
of
race
conscious
order
was
required.
previous
orders
had
proven
to
be
ineffective.
the
alternative
of
putting
the
director
of
public
safety
in
jail,
for
example
until
he
changed
his
ways
may
have
worked.
one
could
never
know.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
yes,
your
honor,
but
it
also
puts
the
district
court
in
the
position
of
perhaps
licensing
discrimination
for
a
price.
the
department
of
public
safety
here
has
routinely
paid
the
plaintiff's
attorney's
fees,
and
that
has
not
deterred
it
from
continuing
to
fail
to
meet
its
obligations.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
your
honor,
it
is
more
effective
in
two
ways.
one,
if
the
department
again
delays
there
is
a
built-in
mechanism
to
make
up
for
it.
two--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--excuse
me?
i
did
not
understand
your
question.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
your
honor,
i
regret
to
say
that
i
do
not
understand
your
point.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
it
has
been
effective
that
is
correct.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
it
is...
it
is
not
obeying
the
one
for
one
requirement.
it
is
promoting
persons
pursuant
to
procedures,
employment
procedures
that
would--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--it
is
not
promoting
persons
on
a
one
to
one
basis
up
to
this
point
since
this
order
was--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--this
court's
order
is
being
lived
up
to.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
that's
correct.
however--
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
--your
honor,
there
is
no
question
but
that
in
the
choice
of
a
particular
ratio
a
district
court
has
to
use
its
best
judgment.
this
does
not
mean
that
the
appellate
courts
or
this
court
should
acquiesce
in
whimsical
orders.
what
it
does
mean,
however,
is
that
district
courts
should
have
and
need
to
have
a
reasoned
basis
for
entering
the
orders
that
they
do.
in
this
case,
given
the
history
of
this
defendant,
given
the
alternatives
that
were
proposed,
the
district
court
did
have
a
reasoned
basis.
mr.
j.
richard
cohen
of
course,
that
would
require
the
district
court
to
decide
promotions
from
where,
for
example.
the
district
court
here
did
by
its
1979
consent
decree
enjoin
promotions
to
corporal
other
than
the
ten
made
pursuant
to
the
side
agreement
until
such
time
as
the
defendant
lived
up
to
its
obligations
under
the
decree,
so
an
order
similar
to
the
one
that
your
honor
is
mentioning
was
entered
in
this
case.
the
defendant
put
forward
a
procedure
that
would
have
guaranteed
that
every
promotion
go
to
a
white
person.
it
tried
to
justify
this
result
by
pointing
to
the
results
of
its
unvalidated
hiring
tests,
and
so
i
think
the
record
is
clear
that
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
the
type
of
order
that
your
honor
is
suggesting
would
have
worked
in
this
case.
the
district
court's
order
had
a
limited
impact
on
white
troopers
in
two
other
important
respects.
because
the
district
court's
order
only
applies
in
the
absence
of
procedures
for
determining
merit,
it
cannot
be
meaningfully
said
that
the
one
for
one
requirement
disrupts
legitimate
expectations
based
on
merit.
secondly,
although
the
government
has
much
to
say
about
the
role
of
seniority
in
promotions
in
general
it
does
not
contest
the
fact
that
seniority
played
a
trivial
role
here.
at
bottom
the
government's
claim
rests
on
the
argument
that
persons
have
a
right
to
be
considered
for
promotion
on
the
basis
of
merit
rather
than
on
the
basis
of
the
color
of
one's
skin.
this
argument,
of
course,
in
the
context
of
this
case
merely
restates
the
question,
because
the
one
for
one
requirement
only
applies
in
the
absence
of
procedures
for
determining
merit,
the
government's
argument
is
simply
a
reiteration
of
that,
that
the
promotion
order
here,
like
any
race-conscious
remedy,
draws
a
distinction
on
the
basis
of
race.
this
court
has
made
it
clear
that
such
distinctions
can
sometimes
be
drawn.
it
was
properly
drawn
in
this
case.
thank
you,
your
honor.
