justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
the
other
case
85-999,
united
states
v.
paradise
is
here
on
certiorari
to
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit.
this
is
an
affirmative
action
remedy
case.
it
involves
state
troopers
promotions
and
the
alabama
department
of
public
safety.
in
1972,
the
district
court
for
the
middle
district
of
alabama
held
that
the
department
had
systematical
excluded
blacks
from
employment,
in
violation
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
some
11
years
later,
confronted
with
the
department's
failure
to
that
long
period
to
develop
promotion
procedures
that
did
not
have
an
adverse
impact
on
blacks,
district
court
ordered
that
promotion
of
one
black
trooper
for
each
white
trooper
elevated
in
rank,
as
long
as
qualified
black
candidates
were
available
until
the
department
implemented
an
acceptable
promotion
procedure.
the
united
states
challenged
the
constitutionality
of
this
remidial
order
as
violated
with
the
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
the
court
of
appeals
rejected
that
contention,
holding
that
the
relief
or
ordered
extended
no
further
than
necessary
to
accomplish
the
objective
of
remedying
the
egregious
and
longstanding
racial
imbalances
in
the
upper
ranks
of
the
fire
department,
and
affirming
the
judgment
of
the
district
court.
we,
in
turn,
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
for
reasons
stated
at
lenght
in
opinion
filed
over
the
clerk,
we
hold
that
there
is
no
merit
in
the
argument
of
the
united
states,
that
the
race
conscious
relief
ordered
in
this
case
violated
the
equal
protection
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
our
results
are
supported
by
three
opinions:
one
filed
by
me
joined
by
justice
marshall,
justice
blackmun
and
justice
powell;
one
filed
by
justice
powell
concurring;
and
one
filed
by
justice
stevens
concurring
in
the
judgment.
justice
o'connor
joined
by
the
chief
justice
and
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion.;
justice
white
has
filed
a
dissent
from
the
judgment
of
affirmants.
