justice
scalia
there
are
other
in
terrorem
remedies
available
if
the
court
simply...
assuming
that
some
in
terrorem
action
was
justified,
the
court
could
have
done
something
other
than
this.
justice
scalia
it
is
not
even
narrowly
tailored
for
that
purpose,
you
would
say,
i
guess.
justice
scalia
let
me
ask
this,
general
fried.
you
said
earlier
that
in
fact
the
one
for
one
requirement
has
evaporated.
i
think
that
is
the
word
you
used.
then
what
are
we
arguing
about
it
for?
justice
scalia
mr.
cohen,
let
me
try
to
understand
what
it
is
you
argue
that
the
court
could
do.
the
solicitor
general
has
said
that
granting,
even
granting
what
you
have
said,
that
the
department
has
been
in
violation,
wilful
violation,
that
where
a
race
conscious
remedy
is
imposed,
according
to
the
solicitor
general
it
has
to
be
narrowly
tailored.
now,
you
are
contesting
that
it
has
to
be
narrowly
tailored.
you
would
say
one
for
one
is
okay.
i
presume
you
would
also
say
that
all
promotions
must
be
of
blacks
as
opposed
to
whites.
would
that
have
been
okay?
justice
scalia
why
not?
justice
scalia
what
about
four
to
one?
justice
scalia
what
about
four
to
one,
four
blacks
for
one--
justice
scalia
--what
are
you
measuring...
what
is
the
measure
of
what
the
ratio
would
be?
the
solicitor
general
has
suggested
a
measure.
that
is,
the
measure
is
what
is
necessary
to
bring
the
promotion
into
conformance
with
what
the
adverse
impact
standards
would
be.
what
is
your
measure?
justice
scalia
wouldn't
we
have
to
second
guess
them
all
the
time
if
the
tailoring
standard
that
we
adopt
is
the
one
that
you
have
suggested,
which
i
don't...
i
don't
entirely
understand.
the
only
reason
you
say
one
for
one
is
the
magic
number
is
because
they
had
used
one
for
one
at
the
hiring
level.
justice
scalia
why
is
that
the
magic
number
then,
as
opposed
to
two
to
one,
or
three
to
one,
four
to
one?
justice
scalia
why
not?
what
did
it
rest
on?
justice
scalia
at
the
hiring
stage.
justice
scalia
but
as
we
pointed
out
in
our
opinions,
hiring
is
quite
different
from
promotion
in
the
effect
that
is
wrought
upon
the
individuals
that
are
harmed.
justice
scalia
no,
but
it
makes
you
think
that
if
one
for
one
is
good
at
the
hiring
stage
it
is
not
necessarily
good,
in
fact,
is
likely
not
to
be
good
at
the
promotional
stage.
justice
scalia
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
an
order
simply
prohibiting
promotions
until
a
validated
plan
was
adopted
would
have
been
any
less
effective
than
this?
suppose
the
court
had
just
said
that.
until
you
have
a
plan,
no
promotions.
i
can't
be
assured
that
the
promotions
will
be
on
a
nondiscriminatory
basis,
and
therefore
you
don't
do
them
until
you
have
a
validated
plan.
