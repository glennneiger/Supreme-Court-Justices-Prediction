justice
o'connor
mr.
fried,
may
i
inquire
whether
you
think
that
the
fact
that
the
order
was
made
conditional
on
the
adoption
of
a
neutral
promotion
policy
and
plan
is
a
factor
to
be
considered
in
whether
it
was
narrowly
tailored
or
not?
justice
o'connor
well,
was
this
order
conditional
on
the
adoption
of
a
neutral
promotion?
justice
o'connor
has
there
been
a
neutral
plan
adopted?
do
we
assume
that
there
has
been
one
ever
adopted
or
not?
justice
o'connor
how
do
we
know
whether
a
neutral
plan
has
been
adopted?
is
that
something
that
was
to
be
submitted
to
the
court
for
its
approval?
justice
o'connor
may
i
ask
whose
fault
it
is
that
there
hasn't
been
a
validated
plan?
has
the
court
been
dragging
its
feet
and
not
looking
at
it,
or
has
the
department
not
submitted
one,
or
what?
justice
o'connor
do
you
think,
mr.
fried,
that
possibly
the
judge
was
just
tired
of
waiting
for
a
neutral
promotion
plan
and
it
was
an
in
terrorem
sort
of
an
order?
justice
o'connor
what
did
we
have
here?
justice
o'connor
was
it
within
the
power
of
the
court
to
demand
and
insist
on
the
adoption
of
a
neutral
promotion
plan
that
was
validated?
justice
o'connor
it
was
in
terrorem,
in
effect?
it
was
a
mechanism,
a
you
see
it,
to
compel
the
department
to
come
up
with
a
neutral
plan?
is
that
how
you
see
it?
justice
o'connor
did
it
relate
to
the
number
of
qualified
blacks
in
a
pool
for
promotion?
justice
o'connor
but
the
order
on
its
face
did
not
relate
to
the
number
of
qualified
people
available.
it
was
only
because
it
was
qualified
that
it
would
survive
then?
justice
o'connor
mr.
cohen,
would
a
flexible
goal
of
promotions
geared
to
the
number
of
qualified
blacks
available
for
promotion
have
been
a
more
appropriate
narrowly
tailored
remedy,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
and
why
not?
justice
o'connor
would
tying
it
with
a
fine
or
contempt
citation
for
delay
have
solved
that
problem,
do
you
think?
justice
o'connor
or
fines?
it
gets
a
little
expensive.
