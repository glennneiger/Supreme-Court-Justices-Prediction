justice
stevens
general
fried,
before
you
get
into
the
main
thrust
of
your
argument,
could
i
just
ask
you
if
you
accept
the
constitutional
validity
of
the
one
for
one
hiring
quota.
justice
stevens
do
you
have
a
position
on
that?
justice
stevens
you
mean
you
haven't
looked
at
that
question
yet?
justice
stevens
well,
the
government
does
not
challenge
that
at
this
point.
justice
stevens
all
right.
justice
stevens
well,
it
was
an
issue
in
the
case
at
one
time.
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
do
you
think
there
is
a
constitutional
difference
between
a
one
for
one
promotion
quota
and
a
one
for
one
hiring
quota?
justice
stevens
general
fried,
can
i
just
ask
this
kind
of
basic
question?
this
narrowly
tailored
principle
that
you
say
should
apply
to
remedial
decrees
entered
by
courts
after
finding
a
history
of
racial
discrimination,
has
the
court
ever
said
that
a
decree,
a
remedial
decree
must
be
narrowly
tailored
as
opposed
to
a
plan
that
the
department
itself
might
work
out
or
legislation
or
something
like
that?
you
think
it
is
clear
the
same
standard
applies
to
what
the
judge
does
to
correct
a
proven
violation
of
law
and
what
a
businessman
or
the
department
might
do
on
its
own?
justice
stevens
but
we
do
have
a
history
of
violations
of
the
statute,
as
i
understand
it.
justice
stevens
is
that
the
message,
for
example,
of
the
swann
case,
that
they
should
do
no
more
than
absolutely
necessary
to
correct
it,
the
school
desegregation?
it
is
the
same
sort
of
problem,
isn't
it?
justice
stevens
well,
no,
of
course,
it
shouldn't
roam
at
large.
it
should
try
to
tailor
its
decree.
justice
stevens
but
has
this
narrowly
tailored
language
ever
been
found
in
cases
describing
the
duty
of
a
district
judge
to
correct
a
violation
of
law?
generally
i
thought
the
presumption
was
the
other
way,
that
he
could
perhaps
do
a
little
more
than
if
there
had
been
no
proven
violation
of
law.
justice
stevens
there
were
a
lot
of
white
school
children
who
weren't
violating
any
laws
who
had--
justice
stevens
--but
just
to
be
clear,
you
don't
have
any
cases
where
a
judicial
decree
has
been
compelled
to
follow
this
kind
of
formula
you
are
suggesting?
justice
stevens
but
your
point,
point,
as
i
understand
it,
is
not
that
a
one
for
one
quota
is
always
impermissible,
but
rather
that
the
particular
facts
of
this
particular
case
it
was
excessive
relief.
justice
stevens
sort
of
an
abuse
of
discretion.
justice
stevens
so
we
are
really
not
deciding
any
general
principle,
but
rather
whether
this
particular
relief
was
appropriate
in
this
particular
case.
justice
stevens
may
i
just
ask
one
last
question?
i
take
it
that
if
the
no
adverse
impact
is
an
acceptable
standard,
it
would
have
been
permissible
here
to
have
a
three
for
one
ratio
for
the
future.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
that,
but
do
i
understand
correctly
what
you
are
saying
if
you
translate
it
to
numbers
is
that
a
three
for
one
hiring
quota
would
have
been
permissible.
justice
stevens
i
am
not
asking
you...
your
view
is,
that
would
be
permissible,
right?
