mr.
charles
fried
the
first
decree,
the
first
litigated
decree
in
this
case
in
1972
focused
on
discrimination
in
hiring
and
found
that
the
alabama
state
troopers
had
indeed
been
engaging
in
discrimination.
promotions
were
mentioned
only
in
passing
in
that
decree
in
general
terms
forbidding
all
discrimination
in
promotions.
in
1975,
judge
johnson
appeared
to
assume
that
the
one
for
one
hiring
quota
he
imposed
in
'72
and
reaffirmed
in
1975
would
not
need
to
be
carried
forward
to
promotions,
that
it
would
work
itself
out.
as
he
said
that
time,
"the
court
did
not
order
promotional
quotas.
"
"rather
it
set
a
hiring
quota.
"
promotions
were
only
focused
on
in
any
decree
of
the
court
in
the
1979
consent
decree.
that
consent
decree
provided,
and
it
was
voluntarily
entered
into
by
all
parties,
including
the
alabama
department
and
the
united
states,
that
promotions
to
corporal
should
proceed
according
to
procedures
fair
to
all,
racially
neutral,
with
little
or
no
adverse
impact
on
blacks,
and
in
conformity
with
the
1978
uniform
guidelines
on
employee
selections.
shortly
thereafter
the
department
proposed
and
all
parties
agreed
that
there
be
a
batch
of
promotions
to
corporal
which
batch
included
four
black
and
six
white
troopers.
there
were
no
promotions
to
corporal
thereafter
until
the
batch
involved
in
the
present
proceedings.
in
1981,
after
a
certain
amount
of
delay
and
further
prodding
by
both
the
united
states,
the
plaintiffs,
and
the
court,
the
department
did
come
up
with
a
promotion
procedure,
including
a
written
exam
and
the
use
of
factors
such
as
seniority
and
evaluations.
the
plaintiffs,
paradise,
and
the
united
states,
had
concerns
that
this
procedure
would
in
fact
have
an
adverse
impact.
but
it
was
agreed
by
all
that
the
procedure
would
go
forward,
the
exam
would
be
administered,
and
then
would
look
and
see
what
the
numbers
were.
in
the
event
the
numbers
were
just
dreadful
and
the
promotions
did
not
go
forward
according
to
that
procedure,
there
would
have
been
no
blacks
promoted
according
to
the
procedure
if
it
had
run
its
course.
therefore,
and
here
i
read
from
the
joint
appendix,
page
91,
the
plaintiffs,
respondents
here,
stated
that
the
department,
and
i
am
quoting
here,
"in
apparent
recognition
of
the
adverse
impact.
"
of
the
1981
procedure
offered
to
make
the
next
batch
of
promotions
to
corporal
in
such
a
way
that
20
percent
of
those
promoted
would
be
black
troopers.
the
plaintiff
respondents
rejected
this
offer
and
began
this
proceeding
to
enforce
the
consent
decree.
in
that
proceeding
the
plaintiffs
again
offered
to
make
four
of
the
15
promotions
promotions
of
black
candidates.
that
was
rejected
by
the
plaintiffs
and
by
the
district
court,
which
instead
imposed
the
one
for
one
hiring
quota
in
question
in
this
case,
stating
that
it
would
remain
in
effect
not
just
for
that
particular
batch
of
promotions,
but
until
the
higher
ranks
of
the
department
reflected
the
25
percent
goal
of
the
hiring
quota
or
acceptable
procedures
had
been
worked
out
as
per
the
consent
decree.
mr.
charles
fried
that
was
in
1983.
now,
in
the
event
the
one
for
one
hiring
quota
was
used
only
that
one
time,
it
was
never
used
again.
the
next
batch
of
promotions
to
corporal
proceeded
on
a
three
black
trooper
for
nine
or
ten
white
trooper
basis
in
'84/'85,
and
to
date
the
promotion
procedures
have
not
yet
been
validated
as
job
related
according
to
the
uniform
guidelines.
there
is,
in
our
view,
a
single
issue
on
certiorari
here
and
that
is
whether
the
1983
one
for
one
promotion
quota
imposed
by
the
district
court
comports
with
the
equal
protection
guarantees
of
the
constitution,
and
we
take
as
our
point
of
departure
the
law
as
laid
down
by
this
court
in
the
sheetmetal
workers
case.
first,
when--
mr.
charles
fried
--that
is
not
before
us,
and
it
certainly
is
a
matter
which
would
require
considerable
inquiry
and
we
would
want--
mr.
charles
fried
--we
would
want
to
look
at
it.
i
could
not--
mr.
charles
fried
--of
course
we
have.
of
course
we
have,
but
i
would
not
want
to
pronounce
on
it
without
looking
at
the
circumstances
and
opening
them
up
again
because
in
the
light
of
what
this
court
said
in
the
sheetmetal
workers
case
any
such
order
must
be
subject
to
the
strictest
scrutiny
and
must
be
shown
to
be
driven
by
a
compelling
purpose.
i
would
be
very
loathe
to
speculate
and
certainly
to
make--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
does
not
challenge
it.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
not
an
issue
in
the
case.
mr.
charles
fried
but
it
is
not
an
issue
in
this
proceeding
because
there
was
no...
certiorari
was
not
sought
nor
was
it
granted
on
that
issue.
mr.
charles
fried
all
we
have
before
us
is
the
one
order
of
a
one
for--
mr.
charles
fried
--certainly.
certainly,
there
is
a
difference.
there
is
a
difference
because
a
hiring
quota,
as
this
court
pointed
out,
has
a
more
diffuse
effect.
the
hiring
quota
has
its
burden,
and
there
is
a
burden,
which
is
why
it
is
troublesome,
but
nevertheless
it
has
a
burden
on
a
whole
undifferentiated
population
of
persons
applying
for
a
job.
a
promotion
quota
works
on
a
distinct
cohort,
people
who
have
worked
together,
who
know
each
other,
and
who
have
embarked
on
a
career
with
certain
expectations,
so
there
is
indeed
a
difference
between
the
two,
but
we
do
not
have
the
hiring
quota
before
us.
now,
the
sheetmetal
workers
case
established
that,
first
of
all,
if
there
is
to
be
action,
state
action,
and
that
doesn't
matter
whether
it
is
legislative,
executive,
or
judicial,
which
uses
a
racial
classification,
there
must
be
a
compelling
state
interest
or
at
least
an
important
state
interest.
second,
this
racially
preferential
means
to
the
end
must
be
shown
to
have
a
close
fit
to
the
end,
and
the
term
that
we
prefer
and
that
seems
to
capture
the
idea
is
that
of
narrow
tailoring
which
the
court
has
used
on
many
occasions.
and
finally,
there
has
to
be
a
most
searching
inquiry
to
determine
whether
this
hand
in
glove
relation
between
means
and
ends
actually
obtains.
the
end
in
view
in
this
case
in
respect
to
the
action
which
is
before
this
court
cannot
really
be
disputed
because
it
is
designated
by
the
very
style
of
the
proceedings
out
of
which
the
disputed
order
emerged.
these
were
proceedings
to
enforce
the
consent
decree,
and
therefore
the
end
in
view
of
the
decree
was
to
enforce
the
1979,
1981
consent
decrees
that
promotions
go
forward
on
procedures
fair
to
all
without
an
adverse
impact
on
black
candidates
and
in
conformity
with
the
1978
uniform
guidelines,
and
the
only
question
before
this
court
is
whether
the
one
for
one
order
imposed
in
1983
was
indeed
narrowly
tailored
to
that
end.
now,
narrow
tailoring,
of
course,
is
a
very
factual
inquiry,
and
yet
it
cannot
be
the
case
that
a
court
or
any
other
governmental
actor
can
simply
run
the
term
"narrow
tailoring"
up
the
flagpole
and
then
continue
to
do
whatever
it
is
he
wanted
to
do.
it
is
meant
to
be
a
break
on
ill-considered
or
unnecessary
recourse
to
race
by
the
courts
or
by
anyone
else.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
absolutely
crucial
that
it
was
conditional.
in
our
view
it
is
dispositive.
mr.
charles
fried
it
was
said
to
be,
justice
o'connor,
but
the
one
time
on
which
it
was
imposed,
which
was
in
1983,
the
police
department
was
offering
to
go
forward
with
promotions
on
a
four
black,
eleven
white
schedule,
so
there
was
no
adverse
impact
by
definition
on
that
case.
nevertheless,
it
was
imposed.
it
was
never
imposed
again,
and
yet
in--
mr.
charles
fried
--the
procedures
currently
used
by
the
department
cannot
in
any
significant
way
be
distinguished
today
from
those
which
were
in
place
at
the
time
the
department
acted
and
offered
to
do
its
four
for
eleven
promotion.
mr.
charles
fried
there
has
as
yet,
and
this
is
cited
in
our
brief,
there
has
as
yet
been
no,
no
system
which
has
been
validated
under
the
uniform
guidelines,
and
this
is
why
the
idea
that
the
decree
was
conditional
and
so
it
doesn't
really
matter
seems
to
us
not
to
work
because
what
happened
before
the
decree
in
1979
immediately
after
the
consent
decree
was
signed,
the
department
promoted
four
black
troopers,
six
white
troopers.
in
the
proceedings
the
department
offered
to
promote
four
black
troopers
and
eleven
white
troopers.
after
this
1983
conditional
decree
the
department
promoted
three
black
troopers
and
nine
or
ten
white
troopers.
at
no
time
and
still
to
date
has
there
been
a
validated
promotion
procedure,
and
therefore
the
conditionality
of
the
1983
decree
strikes
us
as
being
something
of
a
mystery,
because
we--
mr.
charles
fried
--well,
the
department
has
adopted
a
number
of
plans,
but
a
validated
plan,
justice
o'connor,
is
a
difficult
and
complicated
thing
to
do.
judge
johnson
recognized
that
all
the
way
back
in
1975.
the
uniform
guidelines,
which
are
the
standard
for
validation,
state
in
turns
that
a
selection
procedure
which
has
no
adverse
impact
generally
does
not
violate
title
7.
this
means
that
an
employer
may
usually
avoid
the
application
of
the
guideline
by
use
of
procedures
which
have
no
adverse
impact.
here,
the
department
continuously
since
1979
has
made
promotions
to
corporal
by
a
formula
which
by
definition
had
no
adverse
impact,
so
the
guidelines
don't
actually
and
would
not
usually
be
implied.
it
is
a
kind
of
belt
and
suspenders
idea
that
was
being
used
here.
mr.
charles
fried
the
meaning
of
the
term
mr.
chief
justice,
is
that
the
numbers
that
the
procedure
produces
do
not
depart
by
more
than
four-fifths
from
the
pool
of
persons
applying
for
the
job,
roughly
speaking.
that
is
the
so-called
four-fifths
rule.
and
in
this
respect
the
department
has
met
or
exceeded
the
four-fifths
rule
in
every
promotion
it
has
made
since
the
consent
decree.
mr.
charles
fried
yes.
if
you
have
a
trooper
force
at
the
entry
level
seeking
promotion
to
corporal
and
that
trooper
force
is,
let
us
say,
25
percent
black,
it
has
now
reached
25
percent,
it
wasn't
quite
there
yet
in
1983,
but
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
25
percent
so
let's
say
it's
25
percent
black.
then
the
four-fifths
rule
requires
that
the
number
of
promotions
that
you
make
not
depart
from
that
25
percent.
mr.
charles
fried
one
out
of
four.
by
more
than
four-fifths.
now,
as
i
say,
in
each
instance
the
department
has
done
better
than
that,
and
what
is
ironic,
justice
o'connor,
in
relation
to
your
question,
is
that
after
the
1983
decree,
the
proportions
were
actually
marginally
worse.
they
were
slightly
worse
than
what
the
department
offered
before
it
got
socked
with
that
1983
decree.
so,
the
conditionality
is,
as
i
say,
a
bit
of
a
mystery.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
it
has
in
fact
evaporated
because
it
has
never
been
imposed
again.
there
have
been...
there
was
one
batch
of
promotions
which
took
place
the
next
year
to
corporal,
and
the
numbers,
as
i
say,
were
slightly
worse
than
what
the
department
had
offered,
and
there
was
still
not
a
validated
plan,
and
everybody
was
happy,
so
as
i
say
it
is
a
bit
of
a
mystery,
but
it
is
a
mystery
which
i
think
can
be
cleared
up
in
part
by
realizing
that
validating
a
promotion
procedure,
particularly
when
you
are
dealing
with
small
numbers
and
upper
level
jobs,
is
a
particularly
difficult
thing
to
do.
the
uniform
guidelines
focus
on
things
like
demonstrations
of
job-relatedness
of
various
criteria,
which
demonstrations
have
to
be
testified
to
by
industrial
psychologists
and
things
of
that
sort.
well,
that
is
extraordinarily
hard
to
produce,
and
that
is
why
many
employers
prefer
to
simply
go
to
the
language
which
i
read.
if
there
is
no
adverse
impact
you
don't
need
to
use
the
guidelines.
now,
in
the
sheetmetal
workers
case
the
court
made
quite
clear
that
before
you
can
use
a
racially
preferential
criterion
you
have
to
show
that
the
means
is
narrowly
tailored,
and
justice
powell
made
the
point
that
you
can't
find
out
whether
something
is
narrowly
tailored
without
asking,
as
compared
to
what?
the
phrase
which
is
often
used
is
"least
restrictive
alternative".
and
we
submit
that
the
one
for
one
quota
imposed
by
the
court
was
not
narrowly
tailored
as
compared
to
the
four
for
eleven
promotion
schedule
offered
by
the
department,
and
the
numbers
involved
are,
of
course,
small,
and
yet
we
believe
there
is
a
very
large
principle
involved
here,
which
is
what
brings
us
to
the
court,
because
the
four
for
eleven
which
the
department
offered
and
offered
in
good
faith
as
its
prior
and
subsequent
promotions
after
the
1979
consent
decree
showed,
the
four
for
eleven
schedule
has
some
rationale.
it
is
in
strict
compliance
with
the
consent
decree's
requirement
that
there
be
no
adverse
impact.
the
one
for
one
quota
imposed
by
the
court,
on
the
other
hand,
has
no
rationale
whatever.
it
is
wholly
arbitrary.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
the
question
that
you
are
inviting
me
to
speculate
on
was
whether
the
police
department
and
the
justice
department
should
in
fact
have
signed
onto
the
consent
decree
they
did
consent
to.
but
the
understanding
of
that
consent
decree
and
the
use
of
the
terms
"adverse
impact"
would
indicate
that
the
four
for
eleven
is
what
constitutes
compliance.
one
for
one
is
a
wholly
arbitrary
proportion
which
bears
no
relation
to
anything.
mr.
charles
fried
that
is
correct.
it
at
least
is
tied
to
something.
now,
we
could,
in
another
day
and
in
another
case,
wonder
whether
that
is
a
good
idea.
but
that
is
not
this
case
and
it
is
not
the
issue
on
which
this
court
granted
certiorari.
and
our
point
is
that
if
you
are
asking,
was
the
one
for
one
quota
narrowly
tailored
i
am
simply
asking
the
court
to
compare
it
to
the
alternative,
and
the
alternative
was
one
which
obviously
trammeled
less
on
the
white
competitors
for
these
promotions
and
moreover
at
least
had
some
rationale,
represented
something,
and
what
we
don't
understand
is
what
the
one
for
one
quota
represented.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
before
i
answer
that
question
completely
i
must
say
that
in
respect
to
promotions
this
was
to
enforce
a
consent
decree.
here
we
have
the
enforcement
of
a
consent
decree.
mr.
charles
fried
we
have
the
1972
and
1975
litigated
decrees.
that
is
correct,
it
would
seem
that
when
a
court
imposes
a
remedy
an
argument
can
be
made
that
there
is
a
more
stringent
requirement
upon
the
court
than
when
the
parties--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
don't
see
the
swann
case
as
authorizing
a
district
court
to
roam
at
large
creating
racial
balances
or
using
racial
clarification--
mr.
charles
fried
--that's
correct.
mr.
charles
fried
he
can
do
a
little
bit
more
except
where
the
little
bit
more
trammels
upon
innocent
parties
who
are
not
themselves
violators
of
law,
so
i
have
always
assumed
that
the
narrow
tailoring
requirement--
mr.
charles
fried
--but
neither
were
either
white
or
black
school
children
being
deprived
of
an
education,
while
here
white
troopers
are
being
deprived
of
a
promotion
that
they
might
otherwise
have,
so
there
is
a
very
large
difference.
i
would
like
to
just
mention
one
possible
justification.
mr.
charles
fried
i
rather
understood
the
sheetmetal
workers
case
to
make
that
point.
if
you
put
together
the
various
opinions,
that
is
how
i
read
the
sheetmetal
workers
case.
indeed,
the
court
of
appeals
in
the
sheetmetal
workers
case
had
a
one
for
one
quota
rather
like
judge
myron
thompson's
quota
here,
and
threw
it
out
as,
and
i
quote
here,
"not
sufficiently
narrowly
tailored".
so
it
didn't
even
begin--
mr.
charles
fried
--yes,
as
compared
to
the
alternatives.
mr.
charles
fried
as
compared
to
the...
it
had
no
sufficient
rationale.
mr.
charles
fried
when
you
come
up
with
the
numbers
one
for
one,
you
have
to
have
a
reason
for
the
numbers
one
for
one.
judge
thompson
said
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
if
the
plaintiff
had
asked
that
all
the
promotions
were
black
he
would
be
inclined
to
do
that,
too,
so
it
strikes
us
as
a
wholly
arbitrary
number
just
pulled
out
of
a
hat.
now,
it
is
said--
mr.
charles
fried
--oh,
i
am
sure
he--
mr.
charles
fried
--i
am
sure
he
viewed
it
that
way
but
it
is
very
odd
if
that
is
what
it
was
because
it
is
a
little
bit
like
spanking
a
child
who
is
being
good
to
show
him
you
really
mean
it
and
you
are
ready
to
spank
him
when
he
is
bad,
because
on
this
occasion
the
department
was
offering
to
promote
in
a
way
that
had
no
adverse
impact,
and
subsequently
when
they
still
didn't
have
a
validated
plan
the
one
for
one
quota
was
no
longer
imposed,
so
it
was
a
sword
of
damocles,
but
i
suppose
the
point
of
the
sword
of
damocles
is
that
it
hangs,
not
that
it
falls.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
it
is
within
its
power,
i
suppose,
but
it
has
as
yet
shown...
it
has
yet
to
show
that
it
considers
that
to
be
such
an
important
thing,
given
the
fact
that
the
department
seems
to
be
promoting
without
an
adverse
impact.
mr.
charles
fried
indeed.
mr.
charles
fried
it
is
not...
you
are
punishing
a
child
when
he
is
being
good
to
show
him
you
are
ready
to
punish
him
when
he
is
bad,
and
you
are
not
even
punishing
that
child,
you
are
punishing
his
little
friend
across
the
street.
mr.
charles
fried
because
on
this
occasion
a
promotion
was
ordered
by
a
court
on
a
basis
which
we
consider
to
be
profoundly
illegal,
and
the
fact
that
it
happened
to
a
few
people
only
once
doesn't
change
that
fact.
this
is
a
bad
way
for
things
to
go
forward,
and
this
court
in
terms
of
what
it
has
said
before,
we
believe,
should
make
that
quite
plain.
now,
the
issue
is
not
moot
because
those
who
would
have
been
promoted
but
for
judge
thompson's
order
would
be
entitled
to
back
pay,
compensatory
seniority,
things
of
that
sort.
so
the
issue
is
not
moot.
it
is
very
focused.
that
is
an
advantage.
it
means
we
can
look
at
narrow
tailoring
and
really
see
what
we
have.
we
don't
have
the
whole
world
to
roam
about
in.
if
i
may,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
fried
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
is
important
to
recall
that
no
promotions
to
corporal
took
place
after
the
1979
consent
decree
except
according
to
proportions
which
clearly
indicate
no
adverse
impact
on
blacks.
second,
mr.
cohen
speaks
of
delay.
there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
had
there
been
a
validated
procedure
there
would
have
been
some
larger
number
of
promotions
to
corporal
and
therefore
some
possibly
larger
number
of
blacks
promoted
to
corporal.
there
is
no
reason
to
believe
that
any
more
persons
would
have
been
promoted
to
corporal
on
some
other
system
under
some
other
circumstances,
so--
mr.
charles
fried
--because
procedures
of
this
sort
are
extraordinarily
difficult
to
validate
in
terms
of
showing,
demonstrating
that
they
are
job-related.
mr.
charles
fried
over
all
this
time.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
charles
fried
they
still
have
not
done
it.
mr.
charles
fried
the
procedures
that...
i
think
my
point
could
be
illustrated
by
comparing
the
procedures
before
the
1983
procedures
and
those
that
are
in
place
now
and
which
the
plaintiffs
find
satisfactory.
the
procedures
in
place
now
are
a
combination
of
administered
examinations,
seniority,
and
elements
of
that
sort
plus
a
interview
process,
in
other
words,
a
combination
of
objective
and
subjective
factors.
mr.
charles
fried
they
are
constantly
fine
tuning,
if
you
like,
monkeying
with
the
procedures
to
have
them
produce
this
result
more
or
less
automatically.
mr.
charles
fried
well,
it
would
not
be...
it
would
not
have
an
adverse
impact
on
blacks,
and
those--
mr.
charles
fried
--it
would
not
live
up
to
the
decree,
but
that
aspect
of
the
decree
is
slightly
mystifying.
it
is
a
sort
of
a
belt
and
suspenders
thing,
because
the
only
reason
that
you
want
to
have
those
procedures
is
to
guarantee
that
there
not
be
an
adverse
impact.
mr.
charles
fried
when
you
are
not
having
an
adverse
impact
on
your
protected
group.
thank
you.
mr.
charles
fried
the
no
adverse
impact
is
the
standard
of
the
consent
decree
which
we
as
well
as
the
other
parties
signed,
and
it
is
not
in
question
in
this
case.
mr.
charles
fried
that's
exactly
what
was
offered
to
the
district
court.
mr.
charles
fried
it
would
have
been
permissible
because
we
offered
it
and
the
justice
department
raised
no
objection.
thank
you.
