justice
white
what
promotions
had
been
made
just
prior
to
the...
between
the
time
of
the
consent
decree
and
the
entry
of
this
one
on
one
order?
had
there
been
any?
justice
white
do
you
think
that
side
agreement
over...
was
to
generous
to
whites,
that
six-four?
justice
white
from
the
time
of
the
consent
decree
until
the
one
on
one
order
was
entered
you
can't
say
that
there
were
any
whites
who
were
promoted
who
really
didn't...
shouldn't
have
been
promoted?
justice
white
you
said
from
the
position
of
corporal.
did
you
mean
to
the
position?
justice
white
why
is
the
one
on
one
order
any
more
effective?
justice
white
why
is
that
enforceable?
justice
white
based
on
your
notion
the
court
could
never
enforce
anything.
justice
white
well,
you
say
the
one
on
one
order
is
all
right
and
that
it
is
effective.
justice
white
why
wouldn't...
that
is
because
the
department,
is
obeying
it.
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
nevertheless
it
is
implementing
the
one
on
one
requirement.
justice
white
well,
in
any
event
this
court's
order
is
being
lived
up
to.
justice
white
i
mean
the
district
court's
order.
justice
white
well,
why
wouldn't
a
ten
and
five
or
a
twelve
and
six,
some
other
specific
promotion
scheme,
why
couldn't
it
have
been
employed,
just
like
the
one
on
one?
justice
white
general,
why
wasn't...
why
weren't
validated
procedures
adopted?
justice
white
over
all
this
time?
justice
white
how
long...
how
long--
justice
white
--well,
it
sounds
to
me
like
you
say
it
is
just
too
impossible.
it
can
never
be
done.
justice
white
i
take
it
you
would
say
it
would
be
sufficient
compliance
with
the
decree
to
says,
well,
we
just,
we
find
it
too
hard
to
adopt
some...
get
some
procedures
validated,
so
we
are
just
going
to
offer...
the
department
will
just
offer
to
do
the
eleven
and
four
or
twelve
and
six
or
something
that
will
not
have
any
adverse
impact
on
blacks.
we
will
just
do
that
forever.
we
will
just
come
in,
judge,
and
say,
we
have
made
this
offer,
and
impose
it
on
the
defendants.
justice
white
shouldn't
your
answer
be
yes,
that
would
be
perfectly
all
right?
justice
white
it
wouldn't
live
up
to
the
decree
to
get
some
procedures.
justice
white
and
you
say
that
the...
you
argue
that
a
one
on
one
rather
than
eleven
and
four
is
an
exorbitant
remedy
for
failure
to
adopt
some
validated
procedures.
