chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
85-999,
united
states
against
phillip
paradise.
general
fried,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
when
was
that,
general
fried?
chief
justice
rehnquist
general
fried,
what
is
the
meaning
of
the
term
"adverse
impact"
as
you
have
just
used
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
need
a
little
more
help.
could
you
spell
out
what
it
means,
"not
depart
by
more
than
four-fifths?
"
chief
justice
rehnquist
one
out
at
four.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
is
confusing
to
me,
still.
presumably
if
the
department
had
a
validated
plan
this
order
would
evaporate.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but,
general
fried,
you
can
certainly
say
the
one
for
one
is
in
strict
compliance
with
the
requirement
that
there
be
no
adverse
impact.
it
goes
too
far
in
your
view,
i
know,
but
that
is
all
you
have
said
about
the
four
for
eleven
so
far,
is
that
it
has
no
adverse
impact.
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
the
one
for
one.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
the
four
for
eleven
bears
a
relationship
to
the
percentage
of
blacks
in
the
private
force
who
are
trying
to
be
corporal,
25
percent.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
cohen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
disagree
then
with
the
solicitor
general,
mr.
cohen,
as
to
whether
the
1972
decree
dealt
with
promotions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cohen.
mr.
fried,
do
you
have
something
more,
general
fried?
you
have
three
minutes
left.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
general
fried.
the
case
is
submitted.
