may
i
ask
a
question
before
you
proceed,
mr.
kapel?
has
this
ordinance
ever
been
enforced
against
anyone?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
specifically?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
when
people
have
not
left,
have
they
been
prosecuted?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
this
is
a
facial
challenge?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
counsel?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
excuse
me
for
interrupting
you.
you
agree,
of
course,
that
the
airport
authority
could
adopt
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
regulations?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
right.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
now,
the
facts
in
this...
facts
in
this
case,
as
i
recall
them
are,
that
a
minister
of
jews
for
jesus
was
physically
handing
out
literature.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
that's
correct?
assume
for
the
moment
that
the
airport
adopted
a
resolution
that
permitted
that
type
of
literature,
or
any
type
of
literature,
for
example,
to
be
disseminated
from
the
equivalent
of
a
newsstand.
would
that
be
satisfactory?
that
resolution,
as
a
manner
restriction?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
analogous
to
distributing
newspapers.
