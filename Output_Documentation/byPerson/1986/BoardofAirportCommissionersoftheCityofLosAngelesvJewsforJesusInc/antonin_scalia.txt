justice
antonin
scalia
that
means,
i
take
it,
that
if
we
disagree
with
you
that
it
is
a
public...
if
we
disagree
with
you
that
it's
a
public
forum,
what
result
should
accrue?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
we're
worried
about
the
allegations
of
unequal
enforcement
of
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
we're
worried
about
the
allegations
of
unequal
enforcement,
the
christian
science
reading
room,
for
example,
and
the
advertisement
about
environmental
matters
that
are
alleged
to
have
been
in
the
airport.
that
issue
is
not
before
us?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
asking
is,
do
we
have
to
reach
that?
suppose
we
find,
as
you
want
us
to
find,
that
this
is
not...
that
this
is
not
a
public
forum,
but
suppose
we're
also
concerned
that
the
rules
against
first
amendment
activity
have
not
been
applied
even-handedly.
what
should
our
disposition
be?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
we
can
make
that
determination
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
did
the
lower
court
base
its
decision
in
part
on
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
wouldn't
have
to...
and
the
ninth
circuit
did
the
same?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
if
we're
worried
about
these
other
matters,
we
could
remand
and
let
them
decide
whether
there's
been
unequal
enforcement,
couldn't
we?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
isn't
how
your
ordinance
reads.
i
mean,
that
isn't
the
limitation.
the
limitation
isn't
for
the
conduct
of
first
amendment
activities
by
walking
around
the
terminal,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
specifically
is
prohibited?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
i'm
a
congressman
flying
from
washington
to
hawaii,
and
i
have
to
transfer
planes
in
los
angeles.
i
make
an
appointment
with
an
aide
to
talk
over
some
national
issues,
and
i
say,
let's
meet
inside
the
airport,
and
we
want
to
talk
over
the
pros
and
cons
of
some
national
issues.
that's
in
violation
of
the
ordinance?
justice
antonin
scalia
speech
is
not
an
activity?
what
is
an
activity?
suppose
that
the
representatives
of
jews
for
jesus
just
stand
there
and
they
do
nothing
but
speak,
they
don't
even
pass
out
anything;
they
just
speak,
just
the
way
i
would
be
speaking
to
the
congressman?
justice
antonin
scalia
oh
really?
it's
only
the
passing
out
of
the
literature
that's
the
problem?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
couldn't
give
the
congressman
a
piece
of
paper.
i
could
talk
to
him
if
he
came?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
have
a
first
amendment
right
to
turn
to
the
person
next
to
me
and
say,
good
morning,
how
are
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
know
i
guess
what
we're
talking
about
is
overbreadth
problems.
that's
not
the
basis
on
which
the
court
below
went.
but
don't
you
see
some
problems
of
overbreadth
here,
just
banning
all
first
amendment
activity?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
you
haven't
banned...
you
haven't
banned
just
some
types.
i
mean,
that's
the
problem.
if
you
read
it,
you've
banned
all
types.
but
again,
maybe
your
point
is
that
that's
not
what's
before
us.
that
that's
an
overbreadth
problem,
and
all
we
have
before
us
is
a
decision
below
that
says
that
this
is
a
public
forum,
and
you
have
to
allow
all
types.
and
that
even
if
it
weren't
overbroad
it
would
be
no
good.
is
that--
justice
antonin
scalia
--that's
what
i
thought.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
about
that
city
gates
thing.
is
it...
do
you
really
think
that
the
analog
is
the
city
gate?
or
wouldn't
the
analog
be,
to
go
back
to
the
time
of
the
constitution,
wouldn't
it
be
the
inn
at
which
the
coach
would
stop
to
pick
up
passengers.
and
they'd
all
assemble
there
and
sit
down
in
the
dining
room
and
eat
a
piece
of
mutton
or
something.
were...
were
jews
for
jesus
allowed
inside
these
inns?
do
you
think
so?
they
were
private
operations,
weren't
they?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
come
back
to
a
place
where
travellers
gather
to
use
transportation.
why
has
that
been
historically
the
place,
like
city
gates,
where
there's
classic
first
amendment
proselytizing
and
argumentative
activity?
i
don't
know.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
innkeeper
couldn't
throw
somebody
out,
saying
i
don't
want
to
have
any...
you
know,
no
politics,
no
religion
in
my
inn.
we
want
happy
people.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
he
traditionally
was
a
private
operation,
that's
the
point.
and
the
railroad
station
traditionally
was
a
private
operation,
wasn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
that's
the
reason:
because
there
are
a
lot
of
people?
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
think
of
any
place
where
it
wouldn't
be
compatible?
let's
say
the
capitol,
right
across
the
lawn
there.
couldn't
you
set
up
little
booths
for
various
groups
that
want
to
pass
out
literature
to
the
tourists
coming?
would
that
interrupt
the--
justice
antonin
scalia
--oh,
i
think
it
wouldn't,
but
congress
just
says,
we
don't
want
it
here.
this
is
not
what
the
building
is
for.
we
don't
want
it.
we
could
live
with
it,
but
we
don't
want
it.
why
can't
the
airport
say
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
your
test.
if
it's,
number
one,
a
public
area;
and
number
two,
it
wouldn't
interfere
with
the
public
purpose--
justice
antonin
scalia
--substantially,
the
activity
must
be
allowed?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
a
vast
extension
of
the
public
forum
doctrine
to
date,
it
seems
to
me.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
the
rule
was
that
when
it
is
a
public
forum,
you
must
allow
those
activities
to
the
extent
they're
compatible
with
the
other
things
occurring
in
that
public
forum.
but
you're
converting
that
to
a
rule
that
if
there
is
a
compatible
activity,
it's
a
public
forum?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
have
to
establish
that
it's
a
public
forum
first.
i
agree
with
the
proposition
you
just
stated.
does
the
activity
interfere
with
the
primary
purpose
of
the
public
forum?
but
you
have
to
establish
first
that
it
is
a
public
forum,
and
that's
what
i
thought
we
were
discussing
here.
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
test
you're
applying?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
just
look
at
the
sky
and
say
it
is?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
thought
it
depends
on
tradition,
essentially.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
about
the
plaza
in
front
of
this
courthouse?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that
doesn't
trouble
you?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
not
before
us,
though,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
we
should
decide
this
case
as
though
the
question
is,
could
lax
like
the
capitol
promulgate
a
nicely,
narrowly
crafted
rule
that
says,
no
religious
proselytizing
on
these
grounds,
right,
and
that's
the
issue?
could
lax
do
that?
if
it's
a
public
forum,
it
couldn't.
if
it's
not
a
public
forum,
presumably
it
could.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
don't
know
that
either.
we
could
certainly
leave
that
to
the
lower
court
to
figure
out
if
there
was
some
problem
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
sekulow,
would
you
explain
to
me,
because
i
really
don't
understand
this
from
your
argument,
what
is
it
that
makes
a
public
forum
special
as
opposed
to
any
public
building?
because
as
i
understand
your
argument,
i
think
what
it
boils
down
to
saying
is,
that
any
public
building
must
be
allowed
to
be
used
for
free
speech
activities
to
the
extent
that
such
activities
are
not
incompatible
with
the
other
uses
of
the
building.
now,
if
you
adopt
that
as
a
principle,
why
do
you
need
a
public
forum
doctrine?
you
don't
need
it.
doesn't
it
totally
gobble
up
the
concept
that
there
are
some
buildings
where
you
cannot...
you
don't
even
have
to
have
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
even
in
a
public
forum,
you
are
allowed
to
place
such
restrictions
as
are
necessary
to
make
the
speech
compatible
with
whatever
else
is
going
on.
justice
antonin
scalia
in
a
park,
and
so
forth.
so
then
what
difference
is
there
between
a
public
forum
and
a
nonpublic
forum,
in
your
view
of
the
world?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
are
taking
the
position
that
they're
all
public
forums
if
there
is
general
public
access.
the
only
inquiry
you
would
make,
once
you've
determined
that
there
is
general
public
access
to
the
building,
is
whether
free
speech
activities
are
compatible.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
question
of
whether
it's
appropriate
isn't
necessarily
the
same
as
the
question
whether
it's
compatible.
i
mean,
take
my
hypothetical
about
the
capitol.
it's
compatible,
in
the
sense
that
they
can
run
their
business
over
there
with
booths
passing
out
religious
literature
and
political
literature.
they
could
run
their
business
anyway.
but
it's
just
never
been
done.
this
is
not
the
place
for
it.
they
have
just
said,
it's
not
the
place
for
it.
you
would
not
allow
that
to
be
said,
would
you?
