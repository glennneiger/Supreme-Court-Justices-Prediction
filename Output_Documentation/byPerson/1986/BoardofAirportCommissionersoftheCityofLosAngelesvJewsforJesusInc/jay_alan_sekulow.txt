mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
local
governments
have
important
responsibilities
concerning
their
efficient
operation
of
airports
under
their
control.
however,
the
record
in
this
case
is
clear.
there
is
no
justification
for
a
sweeping
ban
on
first
amendment
activities
which
would
subordinate
cherished
first
amendment
freedoms.
in
fact,
four
circuit
courts
and
numerous
district
courts
have
determined
that
airport
terminals
are
public
fora.
the
petitioners,
throughout
their
argument--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
we
have
couched
our
argument
that...
a
major
airport
terminal.
the
designation
"major"
is
not
really
regarding
the
amount
of
people
that
would
seek
access.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
our
position
is
twofold.
that
by
tradition,
if
you
will,
that
a
public
forum
has
been
created.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
a
sidewalk
or
a
street
or
a
park.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
the
tradition,
your
honor--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--major
airports
as
we
know
them
are
a
major...
a
recent
phenomenon.
their
history
is
limited.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
there
is
a
tradition,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
think
it's
twofold.
the
first
part
of
the
tradition
analysis
could
be
that
in
a
limited
history...
there
is
a
history,
though...
first
amendment
activities
in
the
central
terminal
area
at
lax
have
taken
place.
jews
for
jesus
has
been
distributing
religious
literature
for
over
12
years
now.
and
the
other
history--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--considering
the
length
of
the
history
of
the
airport
itself,
that
period
of
time
is
substantial.
we
would
further
argue
for
a
history
in
this
case
one
looking
at
transportation
centers
generally.
city
gates...
we've
argued
this
in
our
brief...
the
city
gates,
from
the
period
of
scripture,
have
been
places
where
people
have
come
to
hear
ideas.
it
later
moved
to
railroads,
the
waterfront,
and
now
airport
terminals.
our
position
is
that--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
in
the
spectrum
of
history,
if
you
will,
starting
from...
if
you
want
to
start
from
the
constitution,
our
position
would
be,
not
being
there,
of
course,
that
jews
for
jesus
would
have
had
the
right
if
in
fact
it
was
not
a
private
enterprise.
we're
not
saying
that
all
places
are
public
forums.
everybody
can
go
everywhere
for
first
amendment
activities.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
the
places
such
as
an
inn
or
a
bus
terminal
or
a
rail
station
have
been
the
places
where
people
have
gathered.
they
have
become,
if
you
will,
the
town
squares.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
the
innkeeper
could
throw
someone
out
if
the
innkeeper
wasn't
a
government
sponsored
organization
like
the
los
angeles
international
airport.
i
think
your
analogy
is
very
good.
but
the
difference--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--no,
i
think
that
from
a
historic
standpoint,
it
was
the
access
issue
there.
i
don't
think
the
case
in
this
particular...
our
particular
case,
i
think
we're
looking
at
the
use
of
those
facilities
as
places
where
people
have
congregated.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
a
different
situation
as
far
as
the
actual
private
ownership.
what
we
were
seeking
to
show
vis-a-vis
the
analogy
of
scripture,
ancient...
the
city
gates,
going
forward
to
the
airport,
was,
these
were
places
where
people
congregated.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
i
mean
it
was--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
in
a
private
terminal,
that
would
be
correct.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i'm
not
an
expert
in
that
area,
and
i
don't
know
if
in
fact
all
of
them
were
privately
owned.
however--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--excuse
me,
your
honor?
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
absolutely.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
have,
your
honor.
where
people
have
stood
around--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
the
fact
that
there
are
a
lot
of
people
in
the
particular
forum
is
more
evidence
of
the
importance
of
those
particular
places
being
available
for
public
access
for
the
dissemination
of,
in
this
case,
religious
literature.
it
is
that
concentration
of
people
that,
i
think,
is
evidence
of
the
need.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
if
we
were
to
phrase
the
issue
as
it
has
been
phrased,
is
that
the
airports
are
traditional
public
forum,
as
we
have
phrased
the
issue,
our
position
would
be,
that
access
that
you're
talking
about,
that
mass
of
people
is
exactly
the
reason
why
first
amendment
activities
should
be
allowed
inside
the
central
terminal
area
at
lax
as
they
have
been
for
over
12
years.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
are
there
a
lot
of...
yes,
your
honor,
there
is.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
no,
it's...
we
would...
we
would...
in
reviewing
the
issue
or
making
a
determination
of
whether
a
particular
area
was
a
public
forum,
we
would
utilize
what
this
court
has
long
held
as
a
compatibility.
when
you
have
a
general
access
open
to
the
public,
and
the
speech
taking
place
in
the
forum
is
compatible--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor,
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
regulation
would
be
appropriate.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
could
be
appropriate.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
depending
on
the
particular
forum,
a
booth
limitation
could
be
appropriate--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--it
could
be
appropriate.
we
would
say,
of
course,
that
an
analysis
of
what
time,
place
and
manner
regulation
would
be
appropriate
would
be
an
analysis
of
that
particular
forum.
there
may
be
situations
where
limiting
it
to
a
booth...
i'm
not
talking
about
a
rental
space,
for
instance,
but
a
booth,
storefront
type
of
situation...
might
be
appropriate
in
a
given
forum.
in
this
particular
case,
however,
the
record
is
totally
devoid
of
any
evidence
of
harrassment.
missionaries
with
jews
for
jesus
had
been
distributing
gospel
literature
at
the
airport
for
over
12
years.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
showing
any
type
of
harrassment,
annoyance,
or
even
a
complaint
being
filed.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that's
a
factual
analysis.
but
there
conceivably
are
places--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
the
airport
has
taken...
of
course,
have
taken
the
position
that
they
have
said
that.
however,
it
is
that
the
accommodating
purpose,
the
contemplation
of
being
able
to
hand
out
or
distribute
religious
literature
in
this
case,
where
it
does
not
at
all
interfere
with
the
efficient
operation
of
that
facility.
if
in
fact
the
outside
of
the
capitol
area
was
appropriate
for
distributing
literature,
as
with
the
situation
with
the
sidewalks
in
front
of
this
court's
facility,
it
would
be
appropriate--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--substantially
interfere.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
it
would
be
a
balancing
test.
if
the
compatibility
is
there,
yes.
we
would
assert
that
if,
in
fact,
the
first
amendment
activity
is
compatible
with
the
forums
used,
that...
and
there
is
a
general
open
access...
that
in
fact
a
public
forum
has
been
created.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
it's
really
not.
in
the
line
of
cases
that
this
court
has
determined,
that
compatibility
has
been
the
threshold.
without
the
compatibility,
there
is
obvious
problems.
our
position
is
that
lax
is
both
a
traditional
public
forum
and
one
that
has
been
open.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
our
position
is
that
the
compatibility
is,
does
the
first
amendment
activity
substantially
interfere
with
the
primary
purpose
of
the
public
forum.
streets'
primary
purposes
are
not
the
distribution--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--and
the
public
forum,
to
look
at
the
public
forum,
we
have
to
look
at
it
as
a
multitude
of
factors.
important
factors
would
be
that
open
access,
general
access
to
the
public,
which
is
clear
here.
anyone,
as
the
record
shows,
can
enter
into
lax
for
purposes
other
than
travel-relatedness.
so
you
could
go
to
the
airport
for
any
reason.
not
only
that,
the
city
has
made
much
of
limitations
contained
in
their
charter.
however,
a
careful
reading
of
that
charter
shows
that
the
facility
is
not
limited
just
to
airport
related
activities,
whatever
that
means,
which
there's
no
definition
for.
leases
can
be
entered
into
for
reasons
other
than
airport
related
activities.
in
fact,
revocable
permits
can
be
issued
for
any
and
all
purposes
that,
again,
do
not
interfere
with
the
efficient
operation
of
the
facility.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
that
is
something
obviously
i
pondered
as
i
walked
up.
that
brings
up
an
interesting
point.
our
position
would
be,
or
certainly
my
position
would
be,
that
there
is
a
line
where
the
public
forum
analogy
stops.
however,
i'm
not
convinced
that
the
plaza
level
is
that
appropriate
place.
clearly,
the
sidewalks,
as
this
court
has
held,
are
public
forum.
i
say
there
are
arguments
once
you
enter
into
this
facility
that
negate
towards
a
public
forum
concept.
however,
the
plaza,
i
think
arguments
could
be
made
that
is
an
area
of
public
access,
and
certainly
one
that
could
constitute
a
public
forum.
whether
in
fact
that--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i'm
applying--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--absolutely--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
it
goes...
it's
both
tradition,
and
it
is
of
course
those
that
have
been
open.
let's
spend
a
moment
on
the
tradition.
the
tradition
is
the
tradition
of
access
for
communication
purposes.
communicating
activities
have
taken
place
at
lax
since
at
least
1974.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
based
on
my
knowledge
of
the
plaza
of
the
courthouse,
i
think
communication...
communicating
activities
have
not
taken
place
because
there
has
been
a
presumption
that
it
is
not
an
area
open.
which
brings
up--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--how
can
you
bring
up...
how
can
you
have
a
history,
your
honor,
when
a
government
authority
says
no?
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
no,
your
honor,
it's
precisely
contrary
to
that.
that
history
existed
because
people
did
it.
people
distributed
literature
on
the
streets
and
sidewalks.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
there
were
laws
in
1789,
the
seditions
act,
which
said,
basically,
don't
distribute
literature.
those
were
challenged.
i
would
take
the
position,
your
honor,
that
in
this--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--again,
not
specifying
the
date,
the
handing
out--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--well,
i'll
do
my
best.
activities
that
were,
quote...
it's
even
more
recent
than
that...
activities
that
were
against
government
policy,
and
activities
took
place
where
those
activities
were
published
by
criminal
activities.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
i
don't
recall
the
exact
place,
your
honor.
i
know--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
absolutely.
the
point
i'm
making
is
that
that
history
exists
in
this
case,
and
in
fact,
the
los
angeles
international
airport
has
opened
the
facility
up.
the
charter
doesn't
prohibit
it,
and
the
facts
in
the
case
show
it
has
in
fact
happened.
first
amendment
activities
have
taken
place
at
lax.
the
petitioners
even
today
conceded
that
there
is
a
place
for
limited
public
forum.
that's
completely
contrary
to
the
position
they've
taken
thus
far.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor.
in
the
district
court,
arguments
regarding
the
california
law
on
the
liberty
of
free
speech
was
argued
extensively.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that's
correct,
your
honor.
they
dealt
with
it
on
a
federal--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--our
position
would
be
that
in
re
hoffman,
as
your
honor
cited
earlier,
would
stand
for
the
proposition
that
first
amendment
activities
would
be
appropriate.
however,
we
would
also
assert
that
under
the
federal
constitution
of
course
these
activities--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
your
honor,
we
would
take
the
position
it
has.
we've
not
limited--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--we've
pointed
that
out
in
our
brief.
inexplicably,
there
is
nothing
in
the
state...
the
district
court's
opinion
here,
u.s.
district
court's
opinion,
regarding
the
california
constitution.
it
was
argued.
it
was
in
the
briefs.
the
opinion
did
not
contain
any
response
to
it.
it
merely
found
that
the
airport
terminal,
in
line
with
other
cases
in
the
district,
was--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--yes,
your
honor.
our
argument
was
not
just
on
the
public
forum
issue.
we
argued
overbreadth;
vagueness.
we
also
got
into
the
content-based,
viewpoint-based
discrimination
analysis,
as
well
as
a
prior
restraint.
the
prior
restraint
analysis
that
we
utilize
is,
as
the
petitioners
have
again
stated
today
and
they've
said
throughout
their
brief,
there
is
this
airport
related
exception,
if
you
will.
the
resolution
on
its
face
bans
all
first
amendment
activities.
that's
what
it
does
on
its
face.
however,
there
is
this
airport
related
exception
that
they
determine,
as
they've
stated,
they
determine
whether
something's
airport
related
or
not.
there's
no
standards.
there's
no
guidelines.
it's
merely
something
the
board
in
its
discretion
decides.
i
think
the
argument
certainly
could
be
made
that...
we
could
go
so
far
as
to
say
that
it
is
absolutely
and
capricious,
the
determination
made
by
the
board
here.
they
have
no
guidelines.
they've
also
pointed
out--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--it's
not
before
you...
before
this
court--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
the
court
has
before
it
facts
which
have
been
stipulated
by
the
parties
showing
exactly
what's
taken
place
in
lax,
the
activities
that
have
taken
place.
in
our
briefs,
and
in
the
trial
court
briefs,
we
have
argued
these
other
points.
i...
we
would
take
the
position
that
this
court
could
reach
these
other
issues.
viewpoint
discrimination,
regardless--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
i'm
also
asking
that
the
court
affirm,
of
course,
that
it
is
a
traditional
public
forum.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
absolutely
not,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
overbroad,
vagueness,
and
again,
the
content-based
discrimination.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
sir.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
under
the
resolution,
there
wouldn't
be
a
newsstand
to
stand
in
at.
because
the
resolution
on
its
face
would
ban
the
newspapers
being
sold
as
well.
it
bans
all
first
amendment
activities.
whether
someone...
justice
scalia
earlier
said,
if
he
said
hello
to
someone,
if
he
wrote
it
on
a
piece
of
paper,
under
this
resolution
he
would
be...
the
resolution
would
not
allow
him
to
do
that.
it
wouldn't
be
airport
related.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
the
question
then
would
be,
would
that
activity
substantially
interfere
with
the
flow
of
traffic?
that's
a
legitimate
concern.
our
position
would
be
that
if
in
fact
there
is
a
situation
where
traffic
is
impeded,
that
a
reasonable
regulation
of
time,
place
and
manner
could
handle
that.
our
position
would
be,
if
the
newspaper
stand
officer...
operator
said
yes,
that
we
could
do
it,
that
we
could
distribute
the
literature;
that
it's
a
protected
activity
under
the
first
amendment.
and
this
resolution
is
unconstitutional
on
its
face.
when
you
get
into
weighing
whether
something
is...
affects
its
usage
overall,
that's
a
different...
a
different
situation.
the
important...
another
important
aspect
of
this
case
is
the
existence
of
other
first
amendment
activities
in
the
central
terminal
area
of
lax.
there
is
a
christian
science
reading
room.
we
do
not
accept
the
position
that
the
christian
science
reading
room
is
just
there
for
a
waiting
room.
the
record
doesn't
say
how
many
seats
are
there,
or
how
many
seats
could
be
put
in
that
amount
of
space.
the
record
does
say,
however,
that
the
material
available
at
the
christian
science
reading
room
regards
the
christian
science
faith.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
no,
your
honor,
it
has
not.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
we
would
take
the
position--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
our
position
is
that
a
first
amendment
activity
is
not
something
we
would
have
to
pay
for;
that
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
public
forum
doctrine
is
giving
groups
that
may
have
less
popular
messages
and
not
the...
not
through
that
cost.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
in
this
context.
the
material
that
is
being
disseminated
at
the
christian
science
reading
room
is
regarding
the
christian
science
faith
only.
effectively,
if
we
took...
looking
at
an
establishment
clause
analysis,
that
activity
is
allowed
to
exist...
i'm
not
saying
that
that's
not...
and
you
know,
that
there's
not
a
technical
establishment
problem
there.
we're
not
saying
that
the
existence
of
the
reading
room
causes
an
establishment
problem.
our
position
is
that
the
existence
of
that
reading
room,
and
denying
jews
for
jesus
its
right
to
distribute
literature,
would
be
a
violation
of
our
first
amendment
rights.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
the
courts
have
dealt
with
that.
when
you're
dealing
with
an
assemblage
of
people,
again,
the
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
restrictions
would
come
in,
your
honor.
however,
if
jews
for
jesus
was
outside
of
a
methodist
church
distributing
literatures
to
passersby,
certainly
that
would
be
constitutionally
protected,
even
though
the
methodist
church
owns
the
facility.
if
we're
on
the
sidewalk,
public
property,
distributing
literature...
i'm
not
talking
about
a
church
service--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
we're
saying
that
the
distribution
of
literature
by
the
christian
science...
in
the
christian
science
reading
room,
allowing
that
activity
to
take
place,
and
denying
jews
for
jesus
the
right
to
disseminate
its
religious
literature
inside
the
central
terminal
area,
those
messages
for
first
amendment
purposes
are
the
same.
the
fact
that
one
leases
the
space
and
one
does
not,
it
would
be
our
position
that
that
would
be
basically
irrelevant
in
a
publicly
owned
facility.
what
we
have
here
is,
in
our
opinion,
a
viewpoint
discrimination.
the
other
issue
that
exists
in
this
thing
is,
one
that
walks
into
the
airport
terminal
and
is
made
aware
of
this
resolution,
doesn't
even
know
what
the
resolution
says.
it
says,
all
first
amendment
activity
is
banned.
there's
an
exception
somewhere
in
the
recitals,
as
mr.
kapel
pointed
out.
that
exception
creates
a
whole
list
of
problems.
who
decides
if
something's
airport
related
or
not?
the
board.
how
do
they
decide
it?
they
decide
it.
there's
no
standards,
again,
no
guidelines
set
forth
wherein
they
can
make
this
determination.
another
position
that
we've
taken
in
this
situation
is
the
existence
of
a
limited
or
open
public
forum.
the
activities
of
jews
for
jesus
and
other
religious,
political,
social
organizations
have
taken
place
at
the
central
terminal
area
of
lax.
they've
taken
place
for
at
least
12
years.
the
petitioners
have
made
much
of
the
fact
that
some
groups
have
been
denied
access.
first
off,
we
would
say,
some
groups
may
have
been
denied
access,
but
other
groups
have
done
first
activities
there.
furthermore,
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
showing
why
these
groups
were
denied
access.
for
all
we
know,
the
reason
they
were
denied
could
be
one
of
legitimate
concerns.
the
activities
that
were
going
to
take
place
would
be
inappropriate
in
an
airport
facility.
so
that
is
not
a
dispositive...
in
our
opinion,
that
is
not
a
dispositive
issue.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that
was
the
point
i
was
making
your
honor,
is,
there's
nothing
in
the
record
which
shows
why
they
were
denied
it,
so
saying
some
people
have
been
denied
it,
when
effectively
people
have
exercised
first
amendment
activities
inside
the
central
terminal
area,
in
our
opinion
shows
that
they
are,
again,
compatible.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
your
honor,
one
important
element
of
our
analysis
on
this
compatibility
issue
is
that
there's
general
access
open
to
the
public.
and
if...
let's
take
an
office
building
as
a
good
example...
you
have
an
office
building,
narrow
quarters.
there
is
an...
an
argument
can
be
made
that
the
activities
taking
place
inside
an
office
building
may
not
be
compatible...
may
not
be
compatible...
with
the
efficient
operation
of
that
particular
facility.
but
it's
that
general
public
access,
coupled
with
the
compatibility.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
that's
correct.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
a
nonpublic
forum...
and
arguments
have
been
made
regarding
a
nonpublic
forum
concerning
the
internal
mail
school
systems.
it's
that
public
access
was
lacking,
your
honor,
in
that
particular
situation,
and
many
others.
there
are
also
cases
like
greer
v.
spock.
there
are
special
functions
of
facilities,
military
bases,
where
that
special
constitutional
function
is
what
this
court
determined
that
special
constitutional
function
justifies...
the
concern
for
national
security...
justifies...
and
national
defense...
the
regulation
or
elimination
in
some
cases
of
first
amendment
activities
from
taking
place.
we're
not
saying
that
all
facilities
are
public
forums
open
to
everyone.
what
we
are
saying
is,
when
you
have
that
compatibility
and
general
public
access,
that
is
what
we're
saying
is
part
of
the
key.
that
compatibility
and
access.
that's
a
balancing.
the
public
forum
issue
is
on
a
spectrum.
our
position
is
that
lax
on
the
spectrum
of
public
forum
is
closer
to
a
street,
a
sidewalk
or
a
park
than
it
is
to
a
military
base
or
a
prison.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
if
in
fact
the
general
public
was
not
allowed
access
past
a
security
point--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think,
your
honor,
an
argument
can
be
made
that
the
first
amendment
activities
should,
if
you
will...
that
should
be
the
line
of
demarcation;
that
should
be
the
stopping
point.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
well,
your
honor,
i
would
say
that
there
is
a
line.
and
that
would
be
an
appropriate
place--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--you
have
to
add
a
factor
to
that,
your
honor,
and
that
is,
are
there
other
activities
taking
place
past
that
security
point?
are
there
restaurants
and
shops?
many
times
in
airports,
there's
not.
if
it's
just
a
cutoff,
only
ticketed
passengers
only,
i
would
say
the
security
concerns
outweigh
it.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
okay,
your
honor,
in
that
particular
case--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
would
say
that
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
regulation,
eliminating
that
area
from
first
amendment
activities
could
be
appropriate,
in
the
event
that
it
was
a
secured
area
only,
yes,
based
on
that
proposition.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
thank
you,
your
honor.
the
position
that
the
respondents
have
made
concerning
the
openness
of
the
forum--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--i
think
there
are
legitimate
reasons
to
restrict
access
to
ticketing
areas,
baggage
pickup
areas,
where
that
high
concentration...
these...
utilizing,
rather
than
a
broad,
sweeping,
no
first
amendment
activities,
a
reasonable
time,
place
and
manner
regulation.
we're
not
taking
the
proposition
that
all
buildings
are
public
forums.
we
are
weighing
that.
and
we
are
weighing
that
compatibility.
and
part
of
that
compatibility
would
be
a
security
issue,
and
part
of
that
compatibility
certainly
could
be
ticketing
and
baggage
and
things
such
as
this.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
if
there
is
general
public
access
and
compatibility,
our
position
would
be
that
a
public
forum
should
exist,
subject
to
special
concerns,
such
as
a
military
base
or
a
prison
if
there
was
an
area
that
was
general
access.
the
court's
decisions
regarding...
in
greer
v.
spock,
although
the
military
base
was
open,
there
are
special
constitutional
functions
there.
and
we
would...
we
would--
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
--your
honor,
the
position
of
something
not
be
the
place
for
the
activity
is
something
that
we
think
is
exactly
why
we
think
airports
would
be
a
traditional
public
forum.
i
don't
take
the
position
that
the
grace
of
government
is
the
determining
factor
of
what
constitutes
a
public
forum.
nor
do
i
take
the
position
that
a
mere
chance
of
history,
if
you
will,
would
create
the
public
forum;
or
increased
mobility
of
society;
or
for
that
matter,
new
architectural
designs.
an
excellent
point
was
raised
with,
what
if
the
airport
extended
its
central
terminal
area
out
to
the
sidewalks
and
covered
it?
well,
is
that
now
banned?
and
that's
the
position
we're
taking.
the
compatibility
is
an
important
factor.
the
public
access
is
an
important
factor.
the
accommodation
of
it,
we
would
take
the
position
that
it's
an
analysis
that
has
to
draw
a
balancing.
there
has
to
be
a
balancing
there.
the
balancing
would
take
into
consideration
these
other
positions.
mr.
jay
alan
sekulow
yes,
your
honor.
