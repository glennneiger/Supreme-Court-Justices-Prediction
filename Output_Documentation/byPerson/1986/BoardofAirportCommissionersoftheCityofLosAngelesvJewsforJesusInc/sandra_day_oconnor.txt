mr.
kapel,
may
i
ask
a
preliminary
question
or
two?
there
was
a
resolution
passed
by
the
airport
board,
whatever
it's
called.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
resolution
binding
without
city
council
approval?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
has
the
city
council
ever
approved
it
in
fact?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
in
another
preliminary
inquiry,
would
the
airport
be
a
public
forum
under
california
constitutional
law?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
about
the
hoffman
case
making
a
railroad
terminal
a
public
forum?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
the
state
law
point
argued
in
the
courts
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
thank
you.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
clearly
there
are.
i
mean,
the
language
of
the
resolution
is
very
simple.
it
says
that
the
central
terminal
area
is
not
open
for
first
amendment
activities
by
any
individual
or
entity.
and
that
covers
the
good
morning
to
the
person
next
to
you,
under
the
literal
terms
of
it.
there
is
absolutely
no
attempt
to
define
it
in
this
resolution,
is
there?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
sekulow--
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
--suppose
that
we
disagree
with
the
court
below
and
think
that
this
is
not
a
traditional
public
forum,
did...
did
you
argue
below
that
in
any
event
under
the
california
constitution
it
would
be
a
public
forum,
and
must
be
open?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
the
courts
below
never
reached
the
state
law
question?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
we
decided
the
federal
constitutional
issue
here
against
you,
would
it
be
your
position
that
the
state
law
might
nevertheless
require
it
to
be
open?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
we
decide
against
you
on
the
federal
constitution?
i'm
trying
to
inquire
whether
you
think
it
then
is
still
open
to
you
and
your
client
to
raise
the
state
constitutional
issue?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
why
then
shouldn't
the
court
below
have
decided
the
state
issue
first?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
let
me
ask
one
other
question,
too.
did
you
argue
overbreadth
of
the
statute
below?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
sekulow,
they
lease
space.
has
jews
for
jesus
leased
space?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
then,
they're
not
the
same
situation.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
they're
paying
a
lease.
and
presumably,
you
could
lease
space,
as
well.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
understand
that.
but
it
does
not
avail
you
to
argue
about
the
christian
science
reading
room
because
they
have
leased
space.
so
it
just
doesn't
support
your
argument,
at
least
in
my
view.
i
don't
see
how
it
does.
