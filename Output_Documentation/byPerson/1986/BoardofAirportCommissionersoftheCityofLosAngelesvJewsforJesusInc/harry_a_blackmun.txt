justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
is
your
position
one
of
all
or
nothing,
that
it
either
is
a
traditional
public
forum
or
it
is
not?
do
you
have
any
room
at
all
for
what
the
court
has
recognized
in
some
cases,
a
limited
public
forum
status?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
you
have
presented
nothing
by
way
of
evidence
to
counter-balance
the
thing.
it
seems
to
me
you're
taking
an
all
or
nothing
position
here.
and
if
you
lose,
maybe
we
can't
take
an
intermediate
way
out,
as
we
have
done
in
some
cases.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
mentioned
the
sidewalk
in
front
of
this
building.
what
about
the
plaza
out
in
front?
