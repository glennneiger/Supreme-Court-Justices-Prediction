mr.
james
r.
kapel
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
involves
whether
the
board
of
airport
commissioners
legally
have
restricted
the
uses
of
their
terminal
facilities
to
their
intended
airport
related
purposes
only,
or
whether
they
must
allow
the
jews
for
jesus
and
others
to
use
those
facilities
for
their
own
particular
non-airport-related
activities.
the
determinative
issues
in
this
case
is
whether
the
interiors
of
the
terminal
facilities
at
the
los
angeles
international
airport
are
public
forums
or
nonpublic
forums.
that
issue
is
determinative
because
it
defines
the
standard
that
should
be
applied
when
reviewing
the
board's
policy
limiting
the
uses
of
the
terminal
facilities.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes,
the
board
of
airport
commissioners.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
it
is
binding
without
city
council
approval.
it
does
not
have
a
criminal
penalty
associated
with
it
without
the
city
council
approval.
so
it
is
a
rule--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--no,
it
has
not
been
presented
to
the
city
council.
the
board
of
airport
commissioners
has
the
power
and
ability
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations
regarding
the
use
of
the
airport.
they
cannot
adopt
criminal
penalties.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
no,
i
don't
believe
so.
under
california
constitutional
law,
i
believe
it
tracks
very
closely
the
federal
law
in
this
case.
there
are
some
distinctions.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
in
that
case
there
was
no
indication
that
the
owner
of
the
property
ever
attempted
to
restrict
the
uses
of
the
terminal
facilities.
in
addition,
as
a--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--yes,
it
was
argued.
neither
court
addressed
those
issues.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes.
it
has
been
enforced
from
the
standpoint
that
police
officers
have
informed
people
and
requested
people
to
leave,
and
people
have
left.
the
police
officers
have
escorted
people
out
of
the
buildings
and
onto
the
sidewalks.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
they
have
not
been
prosecuted.
the
challenge
to
this
case,
and
the
district
court
hearing,
because
of
that,
the
board
continued
enforcing
its
policy;
however
until
the
constitutionality
was
decided,
the
city
attorney's
office
has
not
taken
injunctive
action
against
the
people
that
violated
the
policy.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
that
the
determinative
issue
is
the
public
forum
issue.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
excuse
me,
i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
don't
believe
that
issue
is
before
you,
because
i
believe
both
of
those
matters
are
airport-related
matters,
or
matters
the
board
could
determine
were
airport
related.
the
christian
science
reading
room
sounds
very
bad.
however,
the
issue
with
regard
to
our
resolution
is
not
the
name
of
the
tenant,
but
the
purpose
or
the
activity
they're
conducting
within
the
terminal
buildings.
if
the
christian
science
reading
room
were
merely
a
religious
activity
and
did
not
provide
an
airport
related
activity,
it
would
not
be
permitted.
if
united
airlines
wished
to
conduct
a
non-airport-related
activity,
it
would
not
be
permitted.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
if
you
find
that
there
has
been
viewpoint
discrimination,
where
the
board
has
picked
improperly
and
decided
that
an
activity
is
airport
related
when
it
fact
it
isn't,
then
i
believe
our
resolution
should
not
be
enforced
until
we
remedied
that
situation.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes,
i
believe
you
can.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
no.
the
lower
district
court
found
that
the
airport
terminal
facilities
were
public
forums.
they
did
not
specifically
indicate
traditional
or
otherwise.
the
ninth
circuit--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--that's
correct.
they
found
that
it
was
a
traditional
public
forum.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes,
you
could.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
there
is
room
for
that
in
this
case.
however,
i
believe
that
it
is
not
necessary
to
reach
that.
i
believe
the
non-public-forum
issue
is
determinative.
there
is
no
question
that
speech
occurs
within
the
terminal.
and
there
is
no
question
that
there
are
information
boards
and
things
like
that.
again,
those
activities,
whether
they
be
speech
or
nonspeech,
are
airport
related
and
necessary
for
the
operation
of
the
airport.
to
allow
information,
so
long
as
the
board
limits
it
to
that
information
that
is
needed
by
the
travelling
public
in
their
travels,
i
believe
it's
airport
related
and
permissible
in
a
nonpublic
forum.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
that's
true.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
the
test
is
airport
related,
and
it
is
what
the
board
has
determined
aids
the
travelling
public
in
their
travels.
the
board
has--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--not
absolutely
necessary.
clearly
it
would
be
possible
to
operate
an
airline
terminal
without
food.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
it
is
not
necessary
to
board
an
airplane.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
the
reading
room
provides
a
waiting
area
that
is
the
same
as
any
other
waiting
area
in
the
terminal
facilities.
it's
in
a
little
different
location,
and
someone
other
than
the
airport
is
paying
for
it.
people
read
magazines
in
that
reading
room
just
as
they
do
in
any
of
the
waiting
rooms.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
absolutely.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
reading
the
literature
would
be.
however,
the
activity
of
passing
it
out--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--i
think
it
is
different,
because
the
board
of
airport
commissioners
has
determined
that
a
certain
amount
of
space
within
the
terminal
should
be
devoted
to
loading
gates;
a
certain
amount
to
newstands;
a
certain
amount
to--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--well,
the
board
of
airport
commissioners
does
not
decide
what
literature
is
made
available
within
the
terminals.
that
is
up
to
the
concessionaire,
or
to
any
lessee
that
is
in
the
terminal
who
has
leased
space
for
that
purpose.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
clearly
they
could
come
to
us
and
do
that.
and
clearly
they
could
lease
space
just
like
the
christian
science
reading
room
has,
if
they
were
willing
to
provide
a
waiting
area,
and
were
not
just
there
to
hand
out
their
pamphlets.
if
they
were
providing
an
airport
related
service,
a
waiting
area,
they
could
have
leased
space
like
anyone
else;
they
could
easily--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--that's
correct.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
they
may
well
wish
to
read
it,
and
they're
welcome
to
bring
that
in
the
terminals
and
read
it
in
the
terminals
or
anywhere
in
the
airport.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
absolutely
not.
the
news
and
gift
concession
is
from
fixed
locations
which
the
board
has
decided
were
appropriate.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
no,
it
is
not.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
non-airport-related
activities.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
absolutely
not.
conversation
is
not
prohibited.
the
activities
conducted
within
the
terminal
facilities
is
what
the
board
is
trying
to
prohibit.
the
board
does
not
have
a
limitation
on
a
person's
speech
saying
that
the
only
speech--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--i
don't
believe
there
would
be
any
problem
with
that.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
conversations
are
not
a
problem.
if
someone
were
to
hold
a
rally
in
there
with
200
people,
i
believe
that
would
be
an
activity
that
would
not
be
airport
related,
and
would
be
in
violation.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
no,
i
believe
you
could
give
the
congressman
a
piece
of
paper.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
of
course.
the
ordinance
here
was
adopted
because
the
board
of
airport
commissioners
had
a
choice
as
to
how
they
operate
their
facility,
assuming
it's
not
a
traditional
public
forum.
they
could
limit
it
to
the
official
business
of
the
airport,
or
they
could
open
the
facility
for
all
types
of
activities,
and
adopt
a
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
they
chose
the
former
option,
to
limit
it
to
the
official
business
of
the
airport.
granted,
activities
occur
within
the
facility
between
individuals
which
are
not
directly
airport
related.
but
those
activities
occur
in
every
building.
and
if
the
mere
fact
that
those
activities
did
it,
every
building
would
be
a
public
forum;
every
government
building.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
it
is
in
the
record
from
the
standpoint
that
the
city
has
stipulated
that
the
jews
for
jesus,
the
individual
who
brought
this
lawsuit,
was
not
interfering
with
the
travelling
public,
and
was
not
grabbing
onto
anybody.
however,
the
offensiveness
of
his
activity
i
don't
believe
is
the
issue
here.
the
real
issue
here
is,
can
the
board
exercise
its
option
to
reserve
the
facility
to
only
those
activities
that
directly
aid
the
travelling
public
in
their
travel.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
excuse
me?
mr.
james
r.
kapel
nothing
is
wrong
with
what
they
do.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
because
we
are
trying
to
control
the
uses
of
the
interiors
of
the
terminal
facilities.
the
mere
fact
that
it
is
not
wrong
does
not
mean
that
it
is
airport
related
and
is
the
best
use
of
the
terminal
facilities.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
the
board
has
the
right
to
limit
the
use
of
its
facilities
to
their
intended,
dedicated
purposes.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
absolutely
not.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
because
i
believe
that
would
be
discriminatory.
the
people--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--no,
i
don't
believe
we
have
singled
out
one
group
of
people.
what
we
have
tried
to
do
is
define--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--absolutely
not.
the
jews
for
jesus
are
welcome
to
use
our
facilities
for
their
travel
purposes.
they're
welcome
to
be
a
passenger;
they're
welcome
to
come
in
and
lease
space,
so
long
as
the
activity
they
wish
to
do--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--i'm
sorry?
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes.
we
do
not
have--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--they
are
conducting
literature
distribution.
they
are
not
just
generally
coming
into
the
airport.
they
are
conducting
an
activity.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
don't
know
if
that
would
be
prohibited
or
not.
the
board--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--they
are
conducting
a
literature
distribution
activity
within
the
terminal.
it
is
not
just
an
occasional
occurrence.
it's
not
somebody
passing
through
the
terminal
in
their
travels,
handing
somebody
another
piece
of
paper.
they
are
not
there
for
an
airport
purpose.
they're
not
there
just
to
generally
sight-see.
they
are
conducting
a
non-airport-related
activity.
they're
trying
to
achieve
their
particular
objective.
and
we,
the
board,
has
tried
to
limit
the
airport--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--that
is
correct.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
earlier
in
the
resolution,
in
the
whereas
clauses--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--it
refers
to
accommodating
air
commerce
and
air
navigational--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--by
the
resolution.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
however,
the
resolution
is
not
something
new.
the
resolution
came
about
in
order
to
address
the
interaction
between
protected
activities
and
the
board's
longstanding
policies
of
limiting
the
airport
to
its
intended
purposes.
the
airport
had
a
number
of
requests
from
a
wide
variety
of
people.
the
people
that
ignored
the
board's
policy
were
claiming
the
right
to
ignore
that
policy
because
of
the
first
amendment.
therefore
the
resolution
was
directly
to
address
that.
and
it
reaffirmed
the
policy.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
no,
it
does
not.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
it
would
violate
it.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
the
board
has
denied
that
before,
yes.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
that's
a
closer
question.
but
yes,
i
believe
the
board
would
find
that
if
he
was
campaigning
there,
it
would
violate--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--i
don't
believe
that
would
violate--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--you
do
have
a
first
amendment
right.
the
resolution
doesn't
focus
on
first
amendment
as
prohibiting
it.
the
resolution
allows
first
amendment
activities
on
the
sidewalk
area.
non-airport-related
commercial
activities
would
not
be
permitted
on
the
sidewalk
areas,
the
exteriors.
the
board
addressed
the
interaction
of
the
first
amendment
protected
activities
with
its
policy
by
allowing
those
activities
to
occur
on
the
sidewalks.
other
non-airport-related
activities
are
not
permitted
to
occur
on
the
sidewalk.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
outside
of
the
terminal
facilities.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes,
it
is.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
if
there
are
any
problems
with
overbreadth,
the
problems
would
come
up
in
terms
of
determining
what
first
amendment
activities
would
be
allowed
on
the
sidewalk
areas,
or
would
not...
would
be
permitted
on
the
sidewalk
areas.
i
don't
believe
there
are
any
overbreadth
problems
with
regard
to
airport-related
activities.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
there
is
not
an
attempt
to
define
first
amendment
activities
within
the
resolution.
there
is
an
attempt
to
define
airport-related
activities.
the
board
of
airport
commissioners
has
not
prohibited
speech
within
the
terminals.
i
think
it's
impractical
to
think
they
could.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
the
resolution
says
that
the
interiors
of
the
airport
should
be
limited
to
airport
purposes
only.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes,
i
have
identified
some
activities
that
have
been
protected--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--that's
correct.
speech
is
a
protected
activity.
speech
happens,
occurs,
in
every
public
building
there
is.
i
don't
believe
the
fact
that
speech
occurs
or
that
people
read
newspapers
within
a
building
requires
the
government
to
open
that
building
to
all
types
of
expressive
activities.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
that
is
correct.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
think
the
public
forum,
nonpublic
forum,
issue
is
definitely
the
issue
before
you.
the
ninth
circuit
court
of
appeals
and
the
respondents
have
claimed
that
the
interiors
are
traditional
public
forums,
and
therefore,
all
types
of
speech
can
only
be
restricted
by
a
time,
place
and
manner
restriction.
they've
cited
among
other
things
there's
unrestricted
public
access
into
the
terminals,
and
the
fact
that
people
read
or
converse
in
the
terminals.
they
also
claim
that
there
is
some
sort
of
preferential
treatment
for
commercial
activities
because
commercial
speech,
in
a
limited
context,
has
been
permitted
in
the
terminals.
these
arguments,
i
believe,
fail
to
recognize
the
nature
and
purpose
of
lax,
that
is,
its
airport-related
purposes;
and
also
fails
to
recognize
that
the
government
has
the
right
to
reserve
their
facilities
under
their
control
to
their
official
business.
the
commercial
activities
and
the
commercial
speech
that
occurs
within
the
terminals
are
all
airport
related.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
although
that's
not
the
issue
here,
i
think
there
are...
i
think
the
board
would
have
a
right
to
do
so.
i
think
there
is
precedent
for
that.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
certain
cases
like
greef
v.
spock
and
so
forth
would
support
that.
the
board
has
not
done
that.
i
believe
they've
attempted
to
show
a
sensitivity
to
first
amendment
activities
by
permitting
them
within
the
airport.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
excuse
me,
on
the
sidewalk
areas
outside
the
interiors.
i
would
like
to
save
a
few
minutes.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
believe
there's
an
argument
that
could
be
made
that
the
airport
is
not
integrated
into
the
open
streets
and
parks
of
a
municipality;
that
the
sidewalk
areas
inside
the
terminal
areas,
even
though
they
are
exterior
sidewalks,
are
not
identical
to
those
that
were
involved
in
u.s.
v.
grace.
so
therefore
i
believe
the
board
would
have
the
power--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--i
don't
believe
so.
i
believe
the
board's
policy--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--yes.
with
regard
to
all
airport
property,
they
have
the
right
to
adopt
rules
and
regulations.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
absolutely,
everything
surrounding
those
terminals.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
yes,
i
believe
in
the
stipulated
facts,
approximately
number
8
or
9.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
i
would
like
to
reserve
a
few
minutes,
if
i
may.
mr.
james
r.
kapel
thank
you.
much
has
been
made
of
the
presence
of
solicitors
here
within
the
terminals
for
ten
years
or
so.
the
only
thing
that
shows
is
that
the
board
has
not
had
the
appropriate
tools
to
keep
these
people
out
and
to
enforce
its
policy.
they
have
had--
mr.
james
r.
kapel
--yes.
part
of
the
problem
is
that
many
of
the
laws,
criminal
laws,
were
drafted
to
cover
many
pieces
of
property
within
los
angeles.
here
it
is
the
board
that
people
charged
with
operating
the
airport
that
are
making
the
determinations
of
what
rules
should
apply
with
regard
to
that.
this
court
has
repeatedly
stated
that
a
government
entity
has
the
power
to
preserve
the
property
under
its
control
to
the
uses
for
which
they're
lawfully
dedicated.
this
board
has
attempted
to
do
just
that,
what
you
have
said
is
constitutionally
permissible.
and
we
request
that
you
find
that
the
airport
is
not
a
traditional
public
forum,
or
has
not
been
opened
as
a
public
forum.
thank
you.
