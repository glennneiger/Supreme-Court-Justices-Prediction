marshall
you

just
stand
there?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
are
they
doing
other
than

don't
understand
how

keep
saying
that
the
airport
permitted
you
to
do
it
outside.
they
haven't
a
blame
thing
to
do
with
outside.
they're
not
doing
any
great
favor
by
letting
you
do
it
someplace
else.
am
i
right
or
wrong?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
have
any
ordinance
to
protect
you
on
that?

just
taking
that
right
out
your--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--well,
the
board's
policy
is
limited
by
the
statute;
am
i
right?

the
statute
give
them
the
right
to
legislate
as
to
the
sidewalks:
yes
or
no?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
is
the
sidewalk,
quote,
airport
property?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
in
this
record?
justice
thurgood

in
this
record?

mr.
sekulow--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--suppose
your
group
stood
in
the...
with
the
permission
of
the
newsstand
and
handed
it
out
inside
of
the
newsstand.
would
that
be
prohibited?
justice
thurgood
marshall
assuming
that
they
don't
close
the
newsstand.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
he
stand
in
the
middle
of
that
with
the
permission
of
the
newsstand
and
hand
out
these
pamphlets?
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
you...
could
lax
pass
a
rule
that
you
people
cannot
go
beyond
the
metal
detector,
and
only
those
who
are
riding
go
beyond
a
metal...
would
that
be
a
good
rule?
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
said
nobody
but
riders.
justice
thurgood
marshall
could
be
made
or
would
be
made?
you
say,
could
be
made.
you
know,
you
can
argue
that
the
building's
a
cat.
but
i
mean,
would
be
made.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
want
to
know
just
how
far
you
go.
justice
thurgood
marshall
restrict
your
answer
to
my
question.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
not
add
to
it.
justice
thurgood
