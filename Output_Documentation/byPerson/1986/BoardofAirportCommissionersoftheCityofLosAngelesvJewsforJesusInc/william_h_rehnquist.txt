chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-104,
board
of
airport
commissioners
of
the
city
of
los
angeles
versus
jews
for
jesus
and
others.
mr.
kapel,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
isn't
the
ordinance
designed
in
part
to
prevent
obstruction
of
the
passage
of
people
along
the
concourses
on
the
way
to
the
planes,
and
coming
out
from
the
planes?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kapel.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
sekulow.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--how
has
it
been
created
by
tradition
if
airport
authorities
close
them?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
mean
what
is
the
tradition
with
respect
to
major
airports?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
there
is
no
tradition
with
respect
to
major
airports;
is
that
true
or
false?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
is
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so
that
is
the
tradition,
what's
happened
in
the
past
12
years?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
what's
your
answer
as
to
the
private
versus
public
ownership
of
a
railroad
terminal
in
this
tradition?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
in
the
railroad
terminals?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
yet
there's
no
question
that
people
could
have
been
thrown
out
of
there
by
the
owners
of
the
terminals.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
weren't
almost
all
of
the
railroad
terminals
privately
owned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
that's
how
you
get
a
history.
under
your
theory,
if
the
government
from
day
one
had
banned
discussion
on
the
streets,
there
would
be
no
tradition
of
public
discussion
on
the
streets,
and
therefore
the
streets
would
fail
your
test.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we
don't
know
about
the
hypothesis,
whether
they
would
have
done
it
or
not,
if
the
government
had
banned
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
tell
me
a
little
bit
about
those
laws
that
were
challenged
in
1789.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
pin
it
down
to
within
40
or
50
years,
will
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
was
this?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
somewhere
in
the
united
states?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that's
like
saying
that
the
methodist
church,
which
owns
the
property
on
which
the
church
is
located,
because
they
preach
religious
doctrine
in
there,
somebody
else
who
doesn't
own
a
church
should
be
able
on
the
street
outside
to
hold
their
church
service.
no
case
his
ever
held
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
but
what
you're
saying
is
if...
anything
the
christian
science
people
can
do
by
leasing,
you
want
to
be
able
to
do
without
leasing.
and
no
case
has
ever
held
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--your
honor,
we're
not
taking
it
that
far.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
sekulow.
mr.
kapel,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
like
a
good
ordinance
drafter?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kapel.
the
case
is
submitted.
