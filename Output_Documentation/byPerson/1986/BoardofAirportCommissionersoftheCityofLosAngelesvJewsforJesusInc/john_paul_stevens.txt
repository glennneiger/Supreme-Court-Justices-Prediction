justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask,
you
said
airport
related,
and
you
said,
things
needed
by
the
traveller.
you
don't
define
airport
related
in
terms
of
necessity,
that
everything
there
is
absolutely
necessary
for
the
traveller.
you
don't
need
a
christian
science
reading
room.
maybe
it
helps,
but...
is
that
your
test?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
not
necessary
for
the
traveller?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
without
a
christian
science
reading
room.
justice
john
paul
stevens
however,
if
it's
something
like
the
reading
room
that
provides
a
place
to
sit
while
you're
waiting
for
planes,
and
maybe
to
obtain
peace
of
mind
before
you
get
up
in
the
storm,
or
something
like
that,
why
wouldn't
the
literature
that
is
passed
out
by
these
people
perhaps
serve
some
airport
related
function?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
they
read
newspapers,
which
is
something
to
pass
the
time
and
occupy
the
traveller
and
perhaps
give
him
peace
of
mind.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
wouldn't
reading
the
literature
that
these
people
pass
out
be
airport
related
in
the
same
sense
as
reading
a
newspaper
is?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
why
is
that
any
different
than
passing...
than
offering
it
for
sale
by
the
news
vendor?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
could
they
then,
just
as
they
have...
and
consistently
with
the
general
policy
decide,
this
is
good
health
literature
that
will
help
the
passenger
be
comfortable
if
there's
a
thunderstorm
or
something;
we
ought
to
set
aside
an
area
of
10
square
feet
and
let
them
have
a
booth
to
pass
it
out,
just
like
the
christian
science
people
can
pass
out
mary
baker
eddy's
writings?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
i
understand.
but
wouldn't
it
be
consistent
with
the
policy,
couldn't
they
have
come...
i'm
not
suggesting
they
must...
but
could
they
consistently
with
the
policy
have
said,
we
think
this
is
good
literature
that
would
be
helpful
for
the
passengers
to
read
instead
of
time
magazine
or
science
and
health
or
whatever
else
it
might
be?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
you
keep
going
to
the
waiting
area.
but
isn't
the
reading
activity
that
the
newspaper
offered,
isn't
that
also
airport
related
in
the
same
sense,
that
it's
something
the
traveller
wants
to
do.
justice
john
paul
stevens
why
isn't
it
equally
conceivable
that
travellers
might
want
to
read
the
literature
of
the
jews
for
jesus?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kapel,
may
i
go
back
for
a
second?
the
resolution
itself
uses
the
term,
prohibits
first
amendment
activities.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
it
doesn't
use
the
term,
airport
related
activities,
does
it?
or
am
i
wrong
on
that?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
what
is
prohibited
by
the
resolution
is,
quote,
first
amendment
activities,
unquote,
i
think;
isn't
that
right?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
resolution.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
but
the
conduct
that
is
prohibited
by
the
resolution
is,
quote,
first
amendment
activities,
unquote,
as
i
read
it.
of
any
individual
or
any...
engages
in
first
amendment
activities
and
so
forth,
he's
directed...
the
city
attorney
to
institute
appropriate
litigation.
but
does
the
ordinance
define
the
term...
or
the
resolution
define
the
term,
first
amendment
activities?
justice
john
paul
stevens
does
that
mean
that
if,
for
example,
one
of
these
people
wore...
carried
a
sign,
say
they
were
a
sandwich,
you
know,
one
of
these
wooden
signs,
that
said,
jews
for
jesus,
whatever
their
message
might
be.
would
that...
that
would
violate
it,
i
suppose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
it
if
a
political
candidate
came
in
and
said,
vote
for
joe
smith,
carried
a
banner
or
something
like
that,
that
would
violate
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
would...
and
what
if
he
just
spoke
out
loud
and
went
around
shaking
hands
with
people?
that
would
be
against
the
resolution...
a
candidate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
basically,
whatever
the
first
amendment
protects,
the
resolution
prohibits?
it's
how
it
reads.
what
i
turn
to
the
person
next
to
me
and
say,
good
morning,
how
are
you?
justice
john
paul
stevens
now
let
me
just
be
sure
i
understand.
the
sidewalk
you
refer
to
is
the
external
sidewalk.
if
you
want
from
united
to
american
outside,
where
you
take
the
bus,
that's
okay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
if
you
walk
on
your
internal,
where
you
walk
about
half
a
mile
down
these
alleys,
that's
prohibited
in
there,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
part
of
the
sidewalk.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
some
airports,
out
in
front
of
the
airport,
they
do
have
a
covered
area,
so
you're
sheltered
from
the
rain,
and
there
may
even
be
kind
of
like
a
tunnel
where
you
drive
in.
supposing
the
airport
decided
to
make
its
sidewalks
outside
part
of
the
airport
by
appropriate
constructive
devices,
and
decided
to
extend
the
ban
to
the
outside
sidewalks...
what
are
now
outside
sidewalks
as
well?
i
suppose
your
theory
would
be
the
same,
that
they
could
do
that,
couldn't
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
they
could
probably
include
the
parking
lot,
too.
it's
a
big
area.
it's
all
devoted
to
airport
function,
and
the
driveways
up
to
it.
everything
inside
the
sign
that
says,
you
are
now
entering
los
angeles
airport
or
whatever
it
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
mean
outside
the
airport.
by
permitting
it
outside
the
airport?
justice
john
paul
stevens
putting
it
more
precisely,
you're
asking
us
to
affirm
the
judgment
on
other
grounds
than
the
ones
relied
on
by
the
ninth
circuit,
which
we
do
all
the
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
i
mean
you
have
not
abandoned
your
overbreadth
arguments.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
if
we
think
it's
overbroad,
we
have
to
affirm,
don't
we?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
just
follow
up
on
justice
marshall?
suppose...
what
about
a
particular
congested
area,
like
ticket
lines
and
that
sort
of
thing?
could
they
also
perhaps
restrict
them
from
there?
