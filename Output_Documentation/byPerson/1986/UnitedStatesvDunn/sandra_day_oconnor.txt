justice
o'connor
mr.
englert,
even
if
we
were
to
conclude
that
this
barn
was
not
in
the
curtilage,
does
that
end
the
inquiry?
or
do
we
still
have
to
inquire
whether
there
was
an
expectation
of
privacy
that
should
be
recognized
in
the
structure
of
the
barn?
justice
o'connor
can
there
be
any
area
around
a
building
in
which
there
is
an
expectation
of
privacy
which
is
also
protected?
justice
o'connor
well,
for
a
commercial
structure,
for
instance,
a
factory
that
is
constructed
out
in
a
field,
and
it
has
security
fences
all
around
it.
is
there
any
area
within
the
fence
that
is
an
area
in
which
there
would
be
a
reasonable
expectation
of
privacy,
perhaps?
justice
o'connor
is
that
a
kind
of
curtilage
around
a
commercial
property,
or
what
is
it?
justice
o'connor
well,
do
you
acknowledge
that
there
can
be
an
area
around
a
commercial
structure
which
is
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment,
by
fences?
justice
o'connor
well,
there
was
a
fence
around
this
barn,
was
there?
justice
o'connor
well,
mr.
englert,
i'm
not
really
sure
that
your
proposed
bright
line
fence
rule
is
one
that
would
serve
necessarily
our
purposes
in
rural
areas,
where
it's
typical,
isn't
it,
that
you
might
have
a
little
fence
around
your
immediate
yard
to
keep
the
animals
out
of
the
flowers
and
the
grass,
but
still
have
an
outhouse
or
outbuilding
that
would
be
considered
a
part
of
the
curtilage.
at
least
in
the
area
where
i
grew
up,
that
was
rather
typical.
and
i'm
not
sure
that
your
fence
rule
is
a
wise
one.
justice
o'connor
well,
it
is
to
the
extent
that
the
outbuildings
are,
for
example,
outhouses
used
for
personal
purposes
or
for
cooking;
the
very
things
you
suggest
normally
are
in
the
curtilage.
and
there
are
rural
areas
where
that's
still
the
case.
so
i'm
not
sure
your
fence
rule
would
necessarily
serve
us
well
in
all
cases.
justice
o'connor
you
think
there's
a
separate
curtilage
around
the
barn?
justice
o'connor
and
have
any
of
our
cases
recognized
that?
justice
o'connor
well,
wasn't
this
barn
open
on
one
side?
