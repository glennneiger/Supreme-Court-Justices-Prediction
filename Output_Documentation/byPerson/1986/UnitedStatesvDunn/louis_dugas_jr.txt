mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
mr.
chief,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
justice
katz
provides
a
zone
of
privacy
which
grants
inherent
immunity
to
those
properly
within
that
zone
of
privacy
against
unreasonable
searches
and
intrusions
by
government
agents.
the
vitality
of
these
fourth
amendment
rights
is
mandated
to
protect
businessmen
as
well
as
other
persons
from
violation
of
their
reasonable
expectations
of
privacy.
historically,
society
has
accepted
certain
spaces
as
private
for
so
long
that
a
presumption
of
privacy
attaches.
this
is
true
of
dunn's
farm.
and
further,
dunn
took
a
number
of
steps
to
preserve
his
privacy.
the
barn
was
located
in
a
clearing
surrounded
by
woods
on
a
198-acre
tract.
this
198
acres
was
circled
by
a
perimeter
fence.
the
ranch
house
and
buildings
were
at
the
end
of
a
private
drive
approximately
one-half
mile
from
a
public
road.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
sir?
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
no,
sir.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
if
you
didn't
have
the
house
and
the
barn
located
in
that
area--
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
--no,
i'm
not,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
well,
this
will
show
that
mr.
dunn
took
subjective
steps
to
protect
his
privacy
against
intrusion
by
anyone.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
well,
the
barn
is
not
part
of
the
house
as
such,
but
the
barn
serves
a
function
with
the
house.
this
was
a
barn
for
cattle.
it
had
a
place
to
feed
the
cattle.
and
certainly
on
a
198
acre
farm
in
texas,
which
is
small
by
most
texas
standards,
this
is
part
of
the
community,
part
of
the
house,
the
whole
function.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
and
that's
what
this...
the
officers
didn't
know
what
was
in
the
barn
before
they
crossed
the
fence
leading
into
the
barn.
but
they
did.
and
they
violated
the
curtilage
of
the
barn.
i
think
the
barn
has
a
curtilage
of
its
own.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
ma'am.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
in
dow
chemical,
there's
a
note
about
the
swart...
united
states
v.
swart,
which
is
a
seventh
court
of
appeals
opinion,
and
it
refers
to
a
business
curtilage.
dow
said
it
did
not
address
that
issue
in
that
case.
i
think
in
this
case,
we
have
that
situation.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
a
business
curtilage?
well,
if
we're
going
to
protect
businesses...
and
of
course
the
protection
of
businesses
didn't
come
into
effect
until
about
1967
in
the
see
case.
the
businessman
has
as
much
right
to
privacy
as
an
individual
who
has
a
home.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir,
we're
looking
at
this
after
the
fact.
the
officers
didn't
know
what
it
was
being
used
for.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
there
is
a
sanctity
of
the
home.
but
i
think
that
business
ventures,
business
people,
and
i
think
in
dow
it
was
stated,
that
they
had
a
right
to
privacy
within
the
buildings--
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
--well,
sir,
a
business
has
a
right
to
protect...
they
have
a
right
to
put
a
fence
up,
as
counsel
for
the
government
has
said,
to
protect
their
grounds,
to
provide
security.
and
perhaps
this
is
a
new
approach,
but
a
business
should
be
entitled
to
a
curtilage
as
well
as
a
home.
admittedly
in
blackstone's
time,
this
was
not
the
case.
but
we're
not
living
in
blackstone's
time.
and
i
think
the
concept
of
curtilage
must
move
forward.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
that's
correct.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
i'm
not
proposing
something
new,
because
the
seventh
court
of
appeals
has
already
said,
in
the
swart
case,
that
there
was
something
like...
there
was
a
business
curtilage.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
no,
sir,
it's
whether
the
officer
has
a
right
to
be
there
to
look
in
the
window,
whether
it's
the
home
or
the
barn.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
no,
sir,
it
has
not
as
far
as
oliver
goes.
but
this
is
not
an
open
fields.
what
if
in
oliver
you
had
had
a
house
in
the
middle
of
that
field
where
these
officers
went
in
to
search?
that
house
would
certainly
be
entitled
to
a
curtilage.
but
as
the
court
said
in
dow,
dow
plainly
has
a
reasonable,
legitimate
and
objective
expectation
of
privacy
within
the
interior
of
its
covered
buildings;
and
it's
equally
clear
that
expectation
is
one
society
is
prepared
to
observe.
and
we
submit
that
this
is
an
area--
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
because
it's
an
enclosed
structure,
your
honor.
you
couldn't
see
it
from
the
air.
you
couldn't
see
it
from
the
ground
unless
you
walked
right
up
within
its...
pardon
the
expression,
but
curtilage.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
and
you
broke
the
curtilage
and
went
in
and
looked.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
but
the
woods,
you
could
look
down
and
see
from
the
air.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
sir?
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
i
submit
that
the
structure
makes
the
difference.
that--
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
--yes,
ma'am.
it
was
for
feeding
cattle.
it
had
a
gate
across
where
you
could
go
in;
the
cattle
could
feed,
and
go
back
into
the
fenced
area.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
i
wouldn't
say
it
would
be
all
right,
but
it
probably
would
pass.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
it's
united
states
v.
swart.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
it's
697,
i
believe.
it's--
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
--no,
sir,
it
was
an
automobile
business
where
officers
went
after
the
business
had
closed
and
stood
near
the
cars
to
determine
if
they
had
what's
called
a
chop
shop.
and
the
seventh
circuit
held
that
there
was
a
question
of
whether
or
not
there
was
a
business
curtilage.
and
that
case
if
679
fed.
2nd
698,
it's
a
1982
case.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
but
historically
fences
have
served
as
privacy,
regardless
of
oliver.
the
fences
have
served
to
give
notice
to
the
world
that
you
can't
come
in.
and
this
is
true,
even
in
the
1830s,
for
travellers
who
would
walk...
there's
an
art
show
on
at
the
corcoran
museum
of
art
called
"views
and
visions".
and
it
has
photographs...
or
paintings
of
early
americana.
and
one
of
the
statesmen
said,
it's
considered
rather
ill
bred
to
go
into
a
man's
orchard
near
to
his
own
house.
you
may
look
long
enough
around
you
before
you
espy
a
board
warning
you
that
man-traps
and
spring
guns
are
set,
or
threatening
you
with
a
prosecution
for
trespassing.
now,
the
public
has
accepted
fences
as
this
measure
of
privacy.
mr.
dunn
had
such
a
fence
around
his
entire
ranch.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
no,
sir,
they
even
flew...
in
dunn,
they
flew
over
and
took
pictures
of
the
ranch
that
afternoon;
they
took
aerial
photographs.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
well,
it
tells
me
as
an
individual
i
can't
go
onto
that
man's
land
without
his
permission.
his
gate
is
locked.
it
should
say
the
same
thing
to
the
law
enforcement
officers.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
well,
that's
why
we're
saying
that
the
court
should
consider
what
the
state
courts
have
held,
that
this
is
a
matter
of
privacy.
the
courts
in
texas...
the
legislature
in
texas
has
enacted
a
privacy
statute
for
trespassing.
it
specifically
said
to
prevent
intrusion
on
the
property.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
no,
it
didn't.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
if
i
could,
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
i
am.
i
am.
yes,
sir.
i
am
doing
that.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
no,
sir,
i
do
not.
i
do
not.
interestingly
enough,
the
government
not
only
looked
into
the
barn,
but
they
looked
in
the
carport,
which
was
adjacent
to
the
house.
and
if
you
look
at
the
plats,
you
can
see
that
even
under
the
government's
interpretation
of
curtilage,
that
that
would
be
a
violation
of
the
curtilage.
it
says:
we
attempted
to
see
if
there
were
any
vehicles
in
the
garage,
but
all
the
windows
and
the
doors,
everything,
were
blocked
up.
and
they
say:
we
didn't
need
to
go
into
the
house.
i
don't
know
what
that
meant,
but
i
would
assume
that
they
shined
their
flashlights
in
the
house,
too,
during
this
entire
evening
of
searching
this
barn.
and
this
barn
was
searched
not
once
but
three
times
without
a
search
warrant.
apparently,
it
became
a
daily
excursion
for
the
officers
to
go
onto
this
man's
land
and
go
back
and
bring
with
them
certain
people.
now,
if
mr.
dunn
had
been
home,
there
may
have
been
a
confrontation
with
them
crossing
the
fence
at
night,
and
there
could
have
been
problems.
and
that's
why
i've
asked
you,
as
part
of
this,
to
consider
the
texas
trespass
laws,
which
would
allow
a
citizen
of
texas
to
use
force
on
someone
trespassing
on
his
property.
and
then
we
would
really
have
problems.
because
the
people
in
texas
would
not
hesitate
to
shoot
anyone
at
night,
including
the
sheriff,
whose
trespassing
on
their
property.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir,
it
is.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
there's
one
case
dealing
with
the
similarity.
that
was
a
chicken
coop
that
was
125
feet
away,
which
translates
into
40
yards.
and
the
court
held
that
the
chicken
coop
was
within
the
curtilage.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir,
in
the
kantu
case.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir,
i
have.
it's
557
southwestern
2nd
107.
there
are
some
other
cases
that
hold
between
100
and
400
yards
from
the
residence
is
not
curtilage.
there
are
other
texas
cases,
older
texas
cases,
that
hold
this.
so
you
have
an
area
somewhere
between
40
yards
and
100
yards
that
the
texas
courts
would
recognize
as
curtilage.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
the
kantu
case
is
a
marijuana
suppression
case,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
--could
be
moonshine,
your
honor.
let's
see,
the
wolf
case,
which
is
1928,
was
a
moonshine
case.
and
in
the
wolf
case,
a
texas
case,
they
say:
an
unreasonable
search
is
one
which
entrenches
upon
the
peaceful
enjoyment
of
the
house
in
which
he
dwells
or
in
which
he
works
and
does
business,
and
those
things
connected
therewith,
such
as
gardens,
outhouses,
and
appurtenances
necessary
for
the
domestic
comfort
of
the
dwelling
house,
or
that
in
which
the
business
is
conducted.
and
so
therefore
i
would
say
that
the
barn
would
be
considered
an
appurtenance
under
that
definition.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
not
while
it's
open
to
the
public,
your
honor.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
i
think
the
barn
would
have
its
own
curtilage
in
that
event.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
sir?
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
well,
you've
invited
the
public,
and
certainly
you
would
have
a
lesser
expectation
of
privacy,
and
i
don't
know
that
it
really
would
be
within
the
curtilage
of
the
house
in
that
situation.
however,
in
this
definition
in
the
wolf--
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
--yes,
sir.
but
i
didn't
know
that
you
rested
on
the
results
of
the
search
the
goodness
or
unreasonableness
of
the
search.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
i'm
sorry,
i
did
not
hear
the
last
part.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
yes,
sir.
you
could
have
the
barn
transformed
as
a
room
to
send
your
children
to,
as
a
playroom.
and
one
of
the
reasons
for
barns
being
60
yards
away
from
the
house
is
an
obvious
one.
barns
have
odors.
they
have
varmints.
you
don't
want
those
right
next
door
to
the
house
where
the
odors
will
permeate
the
housewife's
cooking.
nor
do
you
want
the
varmints
trespassing
through
the
house.
so
that's
one
of
the
basic
reasons
that
barns
are
60
yards
away,
or
more.
now,
the
new
immigration
reform
act
has
a
provision
in
it
that
says
ins
officers
are
restricted
to
searching
farms
and
agricultural
lands
within
25
miles
of
the
border.
so
congress
is
speaking
to
this
question
in
this
situation.
they're
saying
that
you...
if
it's
beyond
25
miles,
you
can't
go
on
and
question
anyone
about
whether
he's
an
illegal
alien
or
not.
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
you're
referring
to
the
25
miles
and
the
fence,
your
honor?
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
i
suppose
they
are,
but--
mr.
louis
dugas,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
would
say
that.
they
said
they
were
restricted
to
25
miles
of
the
border.
so
i
would
assume
that
they
could
go
on
lands
in
that
area;
but
not
26
miles
from
it.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
i'll
take
my
seat.
