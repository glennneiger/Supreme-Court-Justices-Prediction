what
in
the
world
was
the
fence
there
for?
just
for
ornament?
justice
marshall
what
is...
what
makes
a
curtilage?
somebody
living
there?
justice
marshall
i
mean,
right
in
this,
what
is
the
difference
between
the
curtilage
and
the
barn,
legally,
for
this
case?
what
is
the
difference?
they
both
have
fences
around
them.
justice
marshall
well,
what
is
the
difference
between
a
home
and
a
barn?
justice
marshall
well,
doesn't
it
apply
when
they're
not
there?
justice
marshall
when
it's
absolutely
vacant?
justice
marshall
wouldn't
that
still
be
a
curtilage?
justice
marshall
if
it
was
up
for
sale,
and
it
had
been
sitting
there
for
three
years
vacant,
it
still
would
be
a
curtilage.
yet
if
it
was
a
barn
where
somebody
was
sleeping,
it
wouldn't
be.
i
have
trouble
with
that
person
in
there.
justice
marshall
well,
would
there
be
a
difference
of
what's
a
curtilage
in
maine
and
what
is
a
curtilage
in
texas?
justice
marshall
i'm
thinking
of
the
king
ranch.
i
mean,
that's
a
pretty
big
curtilage.
justice
marshall
xxx
from
texas?
justice
marshall
well,
wouldn't
your
idea
of
a
curtilage
be
different
from
me
in
harlem,
new
york?
justice
marshall
well,
what
i'm
driving
at,
this
is
a
local
court
that
has
twice
said
just
what
they
thought
a
curtilage
was.
and
you
want
us
to
say
they're
wrong.
