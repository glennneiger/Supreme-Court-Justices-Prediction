justice
scalia
any
barn?
justice
scalia
what
about
a
stable?
is
that
an
area
of
family
activity?
justice
scalia
never?
justice
scalia
blackstone
disagrees
with
you,
and
i
think
he
knew
more
about
curtilage
than
you
do,
probably.
justice
scalia
i
agree
with
all
of
that.
but
that
makes
the
test
to
be
distance
and
not,
as
you're
asserting
it
is,
whether
intimate
family
activities
occur.
because
it
was
acknowledged
that
a
close-to-the-home
stable
was
part
of
the
curtilage.
and
there's
no
more
intimate
family
activities
performed
in
a
stable
in
blackstone's
time
than
there
are
today.
justice
scalia
mr.
englert,
before
you
go
any
further,
what
is
this
we
have
before
us?
is
it
a
question
of
fact?
i
mean,
whether
it's
a
distant
barn,
as
blackstone
would
say,
or
not
a
distant
barn;
whether
it's
within
the
curtilage
or
not
within
the
curtilage;
isn't
that
a
question
of
fact,
and
wouldn't
we
just
have
to
go
along
with
the
lower
courts,
unless
what
they
said
was
clearly
erroneous?
justice
scalia
well,
what
do
you
think
it
is?
a
question
of
fact
or
not?
justice
scalia
the
question
whether
a
particular
structure
is
a
house
or
not
a
house,
would
you
consider
that
to
be
a
question
of
law,
when
it's
contested
whether
there
were
people
living
in
that
place,
and
therefore,
whether
it
was
entitled
to
fourth
amendment
protection,
would
you
consider
that
a
question
of...
mixed
question
of
law
and
fact?
justice
scalia
really?
justice
scalia
well,
you're
proposing
a
rule
that
covers
much
more
than
this
case.
justice
o'connor
was
asking
you
about
the
suggestion
in
your
brief
that
this
case
ought
to
be
governed
by
a
first-fence-from-the-house
rule.
justice
scalia
and
that
does
cover
more
than
this
case.
and
what
justice
o'connor
is
asking
is,
you
know,
what
if
you
have
some
outbuildings,
including
an
outhouse,
that
might
well
be
outside
the
first
fence
around
the
house?
you
wouldn't
consider
that
part
of
the
curtilage
of
the
house?
justice
scalia
just
because
animals
can
graze
there?
animals
can
graze
in
a
stable.
they
graze
in
stables
all
the
time.
and
yet
a
stable
could
be
in
the
curtilage.
justice
scalia
how
far
was
the
barn
from
the
main
house
here?
justice
scalia
how
was
this
barn
used?
i
mean,
wouldn't
that
be
important
to
the
inquiry
of
whether
it
was
part
of
the
curtilage?
justice
scalia
what
if
it
was
used
to
make
alcoholic
beverages
for
home
consumption?
would
that
make
it
part
of
the
curtilage?
justice
scalia
none
of
that's
relevant.
justice
scalia
none
of
that's
relevant.
if
the...
if
the
dwelling
house
had
been
nowhere
near
the
barns,
and
all
of
those
facts
still
existed,
it
wouldn't
make
any
difference
if
there
was
a
perimeter
fence,
would
it?
wouldn't
the
open
fields
doctrine
still
apply?
justice
scalia
it
wouldn't?
justice
scalia
let's
assume
the
barn
was
way
over
on
the
other
side
of
the
ranch.
let's
assume
it's
the
king
ranch,
as
justice
marshall
said,
and
there's
a
barn
at
one...
you
know,
one
extreme
of
it,
and
the
dwelling
house
is
on
the
other;
and
the
whole
ranch
is
fenced.
as
i
understand
our
cases,
the
barn
would
be
considered
part
of
the
open
fields,
or
in
any
fields
on
the
king
ranch.
now,
perhaps
law
officers
might
be
guilty
of
trespass
if
the
state
law
did
not
allow
law
officers
to
go
on
property
like
that.
but
the
fourth
amendment
wouldn't
apply
on
the
whole
ranch,
would
it?
you're
not
saying
that
whenever
there's
a
fence
around--
justice
scalia
--then
what
relevance
does
it
have
that
there
was
a
fence
all
around
this--
justice
scalia
--you
could
say
the
same
thing
about
the
king
ranch.
it
seems
to
me
it's
irrelevant.
really
the
only
question
is
whether
the
barn
is
part
of
the
house.
justice
scalia
well,
that
i
understand.
i
think
that's
the
issue.
justice
scalia
well,
that's
sort
of
a
conclusion.
the
last
part
of
it
is
what
we're
talking
about,
i
guess.
justice
scalia
that
it's
one
society
is
prepared
to
approve.
and
i
guess
that's
what
you're
asking
us
to
say,
that
society
approves
it?
justice
scalia
but
how
do
you
know
whether
society
approves
it
or
not?
i
mean,
you
know,
the
person
who's
in
the
middle
of
an
open
field
and
conducting
activities
in
a
forest,
he
expects
that
he
is
unobserved
and
has
privacy;
he's
on
his
own
land.
and
we've
said
that
we
don't
approve
that
expectation
of
privacy.
now,
why
should
we
approve
this
one?
do
you
really
think
barns
are
somehow...
i
can
understand
how
houses,
and
the
area
immediately
around
the
house.
we
talk
about
the
sanctity
of
the
home.
we
don't
talk
about
the
sanctity
of
the
barn
why
should
we
adopt
a
special
rule
for
barns
as
opposed
to
woods?
justice
scalia
you
could
say
the
same
about--
justice
scalia
--you
could
say
the
same
about
the
woods
on
an
open...
on
an
open
tract,
privately
owned
tract.
justice
scalia
not
in
the
summer.
so
it's
the
structure?
justice
scalia
so
the
policeman
could
have
looked
into
the
barn
from
a
greater
distance.
your
objection
is
that
they
went
inside
the
fence
around
the
barn.
had
they
stood
outside
the
fence
and
used
a
more
powerful
flashlight
and
if
necessary
binoculars,
that
would
have
been
all
right?
justice
scalia
but
crossing
the
fence,
they
violate
the
sanctity
of
the
barn
somehow?
justice
scalia
are
these
cases
burglary
cases
or
are
they
suppression
of
evidence
cases?
justice
scalia
the
earlier
ones
you
referred
to,
are
they
burglary...
they're
probably...
if
they're
that
old,
they're
probably
burglary
cases.
justice
scalia
xxx
depend
on
how
the
barn's
being
used?
i
mean,
suppose
i
have
this
same
property,
and
100
yards
away,
let's
suppose
i
paint
the
barn
red,
and
i
call
it
the
little
red
barn,
and
i
run
a
restaurant
there.
or
i
have
auctions
in
the
barn.
in
other
words,
i'm
using
it
for
a
public
business,
and
the
public
comes
in
and
out
of
the
barn
all
the
time.
justice
scalia
but
i
live
100
yards
away
in
my
ranch
house.
now,
you
wouldn't
consider
that
barn,
though
it's
still
a
barn,
you
wouldn't
consider
that
to
be
part
of
the
curtilage,
would
you?
justice
scalia
no,
i
mean,
at
night.
the
public's
gone.
public's
gone
home.
justice
scalia
well,
never
mind
that.
is
it
part
of
the
curtilage
of
the
house?
justice
scalia
maybe
it
has
its
own,
but
is
it
part
of
the
curtilage
of
the
house?
justice
scalia
so
it
really
does
depend
a
lot
on
the
use
of
the
barn.
it's
very
hard
to
say
whether
it
is
or
it
isn't
until
you
know
how
it's
being
used.
now,
if
that's
crucial,
we
now
know
how
this
was
being
used.
it
was
being
used
to
manufacture
unlawful
substances,
right?
justice
scalia
well,
let's
assume
it
was
being
used
to
manufacture
lawful
substances.
would
you
consider
that
part
of
the
house?
justice
scalia
would
you
still
consider
it
part
of
the
curtilage
of
the
house?
you
have
a
barn,
and
you
start
a
manufacturing
business
in
the
barn,
lawful;
lawful
substances.
you'd
consider
that
part
of
the
curtilage
of
the
house,
still?
