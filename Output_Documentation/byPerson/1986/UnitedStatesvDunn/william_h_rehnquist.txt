chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
no.
85-998,
united
states
versus
dunn.
mr.
englert,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
is
a
pole
barn,
mr.
englert?
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
three
sides
closed
and
one
open?
or
are
all
four
sides
open?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
dugas.
chief
justice
rehnquist
why
would
there
be
a
business
curtilage?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
does
that
really
make
sense,
or
is
that
accurate
to
say,
in
the
light
of
our
decisions,
that
a
businessman
such
as
your
client,
manufacturing
amphetamines
in
the
barn,
has
as
much
right
as
someone
who
wants
to
use
their
home,
perhaps
to
manufacture
amphetamines?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
seems
to
me
what
you
say
neglects
all
of
the
emphasis
in
our
cases
about
the
peculiar
sanctity
of
the
home.
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
the
cases
certainly
establish
that.
but
what
you're
asking
the
court
to
say
is
that
there's
a
curtilage
doctrine
that
applies
to
a
business
premise
the
same
way
it
applies
to
the
home
premises.
and
i'm
suggesting
to
you
that
i
don't
think
that
argument
is
really
made
out,
at
least
on
what
you've
said
so
far.
chief
justice
rehnquist
it's
the
structure
that
makes
the
difference?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
yet
you
agree
that
that
would
not
preclude
observation
of
various
places
on
the
ranch
within
that
fence,
under
oliver?
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
what
is
the
materiality
of
this
exterior
fence?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
oliver
said
it
doesn't
say
the
same
thing
to
the
law
enforcement
people.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
that
isn't
what...
the
fifth
circuit
didn't
rely
on
that
in
its
judgment.
chief
justice
rehnquist
are
you
asking
us
to
change
oliver?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
you're
always
free
to
ask.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
englert...
pardon,
mr.
dugas.
mr.
englert,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-998,
united
states
against
dunn
will
be
announced
by
justice
white.
