suppose
there's
no
fence
around
the
house,
and
you
sneak
up
and
shine
your...
officer
sneaks
up
and
shines
his
flashlight
through
the
window,
sees
something--
justice
white
--but
you
seem
to
think...
you
seem
to
think
that
the
officers
had
no
business
going
inside
the
barn
without
a
warrant;
is
that
right?
justice
white
well,
is
that
right
or
not?
justice
white
so
that...
so
they
might
just
as
well,
instead
of
shining
their
flashlight,
just
enter
the
barn.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that
you
needed
a
warrant
to
go
into
the
barn.
justice
white
why
would
you
be
permitted
to
shine
your
flashlight
through
the
window--
justice
white
--to
see
something
that
you
couldn't
enter
and
see?
justice
white
but
only
with
a
flashlight.
justice
white
unless
you're
shining
it
into
a
house?
justice
white
well,
what
about
a
searchlight...
what
about
a
searchlight
from
across
the
street,
shining
into
a
house?
justice
white
yes.
justice
white
why
would
it?
justice
white
you
can't
look
in
a
house
with
the
aid
of
a
light
from
outside
the
curtilage,
but
you
can
look
in
a
barn
that
you
need
a
warrant
to
get
into?
justice
white
that's
the
government's
submission.
justice
white
well,
the
question
here
is
whether
you
could
sneak
up
to
the
barn
and
look
through
the
window.
isn't
that
the
issue?
justice
white
and
you
couldn't
do
that
with
a
house,
i
take
it?
justice
white
and
you
say
the
same
rule
should
apply?
justice
white
but
there
are
no
cases
like
this?
you
say
you're
proposing
something
rather
new?
justice
white
but
just
the
fact
that
it's
a
trespass
doesn't
make
the
difference,
does
it?
justice
white
well,
technically,
he's
a
trespasser.
but
that
hasn't
prevailed
against
the
open
fields
doctrine,
has
it?
justice
white
but
i
take
it
you
don't
think
that's
critical
to
your
case,
to
have
to
overrule
oliver?
justice
white
well,
that's
a
risk
the
sheriff
takes,
i
guess.
justice
white
do
you
know--
--they
better
read
oliver,
i
think.
do
you
know,
if
this
case
had
been
a
texas
state
prosecution
rather
than
a
federal
prosecution,
do
you
know
whether
the
texas
courts
would
have
admitted
the
evidence?
justice
white
xxx
fields?
justice
white
do
you
have
that
citation?
justice
white
the
federal
government
is
suggesting
a
similar
bright
line
rule
here,
the
first
fence
rule.
justice
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
as
the
opinion
on
file
with
the
clerk
indicates
the
court
reverses
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
fifth
circuit
in
this
case.
justice
scalia
has
filed
a
concurring
statement
disassociating
himself
from
a
portion
of
the
opinion;
justice
brennan
has
filed
a
dissenting
opinion
in
which
justice
marshall
has
joined.
