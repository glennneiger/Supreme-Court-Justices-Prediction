mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
terms
of
the
fourth
amendment
refer
only
to
persons,
houses,
papers
and
effects.
in
light
of
that
language,
this
court
held
in
1924,
in
hester,
and
reaffirmed
60
years
later
in
oliver,
that
a
landowner
is
not
protected
by
the
fourth
amendment
against
searches
of
the
open
fields
on
his
property.
at
the
same
time,
the
court
has
made
clear
that
the
term,
houses,
in
the
fourth
amendment
will
be
construed
to
include
the
so-called
"curtilage"
of
the
house.
the
curtilage,
unlike
the
open
fields,
receives
some
fourth
amendment
protection.
the
question
in
this
case
is
whether
the
curtilage
ends
and
the
open
fields
begin.
the
specific
property
at
issue
in
this
case
is
the
grounds
surrounding
a
barn
on
a
ranch
in
texas.
i
would
invite
the
court's
attention
to
page
51a
in
the
appendix
to
the
supplement
to
the
petition
for
certiorari,
which
depicts
the
relevant
part
of
that
ranch
property
in
texas.
the
area
searched
was
the
area
shown
at
the
top
of
this
chart,
where
the
large
barn
is.
as
the
court
can
see,
the
barn
is
removed
by
some
60
yards
from
the
house;
there's
a
fence
around
the
house;
there's
a
fence
around
the
barn;
and
there
is
an
intervening
fenced
area.
on
the
night
of
november
5th,
1980,
two
law
enforcement
officers
entered
the
ranch
property
and
approached
this
barn.
when
they
arrived
at
the
barn,
they
did
not
enter
it.
instead,
they
stood
outside,
and
using
their
flashlights,
looked
through
the
open
side
of
this
pole
barn,
looking
through
a
non-opaque
wire
netting.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
it's
a
barn
in
which
there
are
poles
supporting
the
overhang.
it
has
an
open
side,
as
opposed
to
being
a
structure
with
four
walls.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
one
side
is
open,
your
honor.
in
plain
view,
within
this
barn,
the
officers
saw
an
amphetamine
laboratory
in
operation.
without
entering
any
of
the
buildings
on
the
ranch
property,
they
left
and
secured
a
warrant
for
the
seizure
of
this
illegal
drug
laboratory.
in
1982
the
fifth
circuit
held
that
the
officers
had
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
approaching
this
barn,
because
it
was
within
the
protected
curtilage
of
the
dunn
ranch
house.
the
government
petition
for
certiorari
to
review
that
decision.
certiorari
was
granted.
the
decision
was
vacated
and
remanded
for
further
consideration
in
light
of
oliver.
on
remand,
in
1985,
the
court
of
appeals
found
it
clear
in
the
oliver
case
that
this
barn
was
not
within
the
protected
curtilage
of
the
ranch
house.
it
held,
nonetheless,
that
the
officers
had
violated
the
fourth
amendment
by
peering
into
it.
the
government
again
petitioned
for
certiorari,
and
while
our
petition
was
pending,
several
judges
of
the
court
of
appeals
entered
dissents
from
the
denial
of
rehearing
en
banc.
the
panel
then
vacated
its
1985
opinion
and
reinstated
its
1982
opinion,
holding
that
the
barn
was
within
the
protected
curtilage.
the
question
before
this
court,
therefore,
is
whether
the
barn
is
within
the
curtilage
of
the
ranch
house.
the
court
of
appeals
has
committed
manifest
error
by
holding
that
this
barn
was
within
the
curtilage.
this
court
has
now
stated
several
times
that
the
curtilage
is
an
area
of
intimate
family
activities
immediately
adjacent
to
the
home.
a
barn
is
not
such
an
area.
it
is
the
antithesis
of
such
an
area.
the
typical
barn
houses
fertilizer--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
the
typical
barn
is
used
for
the
opposite
purposes.
certainly,
a
barn
could
be
converted
into
an
area
of
family
activity.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
should
think
not,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
unless
it
were
converted,
i
can't
imagine
such
a
place,
no.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
a
property
immediately
adjacent
to
the
home
may
be
protected
as
curtilage
without
the
necessity
for
its
own
use
for
intimate
family
activity,
because
its
immediate
adjacency
to
the
home
makes
it
part
of
the
area
that
is
protected.
of
course,
the
concept
of
curtilage
came
out
of
the
english
common
law
of
burglary,
in
which
it
was
a
capital
offense
to
enter
the
curtilage
at
nighttime
with
felonious
intent.
it
was
not
a
capital
offense
to
do
the
same
thing
outside
the
curtilage.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that's
true,
your
honor.
however,
in
looking
at
buildings
that
are
not
immediately
adjacent
to
the
home,
the
courts
of
appeals
have
looked
to
the
use
given
to
a
building
or
to
an
area,
and
this
court
has
stated
in
oliver,
in
dow,
in
ciraolo,
that
the
purpose
of
curtilage
is
to
protect
the
area
of
intimate
family
activities.
so
that
is
at
least
part
of
the
question,
if
the
court
is
going
to
apply
a
balancing
approach.
as
justice
scalia
mentioned,
of
course,
distance
is
a
major
factor
in
determining
what
is
and
is
not
curtilage.
this
barn
was
some
60
yards
away
from
the
home,
hardly
in
the
shadow
of
the
home,
hardly
what
most
people
would
refer
to
as
immediately
adjacent
to
the
home.
it
was
also
separated
from
the
home
by
not
one
but
several
fences.
according
to
the
tests
of
care
v.
united
states,
the
tests
that
have
been
applied
by
the
court
of
appeals,
there
is
simply
nothing
to
recommend
this
barn
as
part
of
the
curtilage.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
in
a
case
in
which
the
officers
do
not
enter
the
building,
but
merely
look
into
it
from
the
open
fields,
we
think
a
holding
that
it
was
not
within
the
curtilage
would
end
the
inquiry.
there
may
be
special
rules--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
that
is
precisely
what
the
curtilage
doctrine
is
designed
to
do.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
there
are
suggestions
in
the
dow
case,
that
with
the
extraordinary
security
measures
that
were
taken
to
protect
the
ground
around
the
buildings
in
that
case,
that
there
would
be
a
legitimate
expectation
of
privacy
against
ground
level
inspection.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
think
it
would
be
appropriate
to
call
that
a
curtilage,
because
that
is
not
what
the
curtilage
concept
is
about.
the
curtilage
concept
is
about
home
life.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think...
if
sufficient
measures
are
taken
to
protect
it,
i
think
the
dow
case
indicates
that
there
is
such
an
area.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
there
was
a
fence
that
could
be
entered
around
this
barn,
but--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
a
fence
in
these
circumstances
would
often
be
for
the
purpose
of
controlling
animal
movements.
based
on--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
the
court
were
to
hold
that
it
were
a
question
of
fact,
it
should
go
along
with
the
district
court's
ruling,
which
did
not
suppress
this
evidence,
and
held
that
there
was
not
an
invasion
of
the
curtilage.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it
could
properly
be
termed
a
mixed
question
of
fact
involved,
because
the
question
of
what
is
curtilage,
of
course,
is
a
question
of
law.
it's
a
question
of
law
on
which
there
has
been
some
confusion
in
the
lower
courts--
the
question
of
whether
a
particular
property
meets
that
definition
would
appropriately
be
treated
as
a
question
of
fact.
but
in
these
circumstances--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i
think
it
very
well
might
be,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
it
depends
on
what
legal
standards
are
to
be
applied
to
determine
whether
something
is
a
house,
as
well
as
depending
on
whether
those
legal
standards
were
met.
we
think
it
would
be
appropriate
for
the
court
in
this
case
to
carry
on
what
i
may
call
the
unfinished
business
of
oliver,
and
to
begin
to
set
bright
line
rules
for
what
is
and
what
is
not
curtilage.
both
the
majority
and
the
dissenting
opinion
in
oliver
suggested
that
there
was
a
need
for
bright
line
rules
in
this
area.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
if
somebody--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
but
one
is
immediately
adjacent
to
the
home;
one
is
an
extension--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
people
live
in
homes
and
carry
on
family
activity
in
homes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
it
certainly
does,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
absolutely
vacant
in
the
sense
of
uninhabited,
i'm
not
sure
it
does.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there's
still
a
curtilage
if
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
it
were
a
barn
where
somebody
was
sleeping,
it
would
be
a
different
case.
in
fact,
there
was
questioning
in
the
record
in
this
case
about
whether
mr.
dunn
slept
in
the
barn;
and
the
answer
was,
no,
of
course
he
slept
in
the
house.
this
is
not
a
case
of
a
barn
that
has
been
converted
to
use
for
the
normal
activities
of
day-to-day
living,
family
life.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
there
could
be,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
with
the
king
ranch,
your
honor.
but--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no.
there
may
be
a
difference.
and
i
think
it's
not
so
much
a
difference
from
state
to
state,
as
a
difference
between
urban
property
and
rural
property.
the
curtilage
around
a
suburban
home
in
springfield,
virginia,
where
i
grew
up,
and
a
curtilage
around
a
ranch
in
texas
may
differ.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
this
court
has
said
three
times
what
it
thought
a
curtilage
was,
once
saying
this
court's
decision
made
it
clear
that
this
wasn't
a
curtilage,
and
then
reversing
course,
and
saying
without
explanation,
that
it
was.
furthermore,
the
district
court,
which
was
more
local
than
the
court
of
appeals,
said
this
wasn't
a
curtilage.
so
i
would
submit
that
that's
really
not
dispositive
of
the
question.
in
addition,
the
fence
rule
that
we
have
proposed
in
our
brief
gives
some
recognition
to
the
varying
nature
of
a
curtilage
on
different
kinds
of
property.
in
an
area
where
the
homeowner
carries
on
family
life
in
a
wider
part
of
his
land,
he
may
be
expected
to
erect
a
larger
fence
to
set
off
a
larger
area
around
his
home
as
the
special
area.
this
fence
rule
that
we
propose,
of
course,
comes
straight
out
of
the
common
law.
justice
scalia
has
referred
to
blackstone's
commentaries,
which
distinguish
a
barn
within
a
common
enclosure
with
the
house
from
a
distant
barn
or
stable.
the
common
enclosure
was
critical
at
the
common
law,
and
indeed,
the
english
courts
probably
went
too
far
even
for
our
purposes
in
holding
that
the
absence
of
an
enclosure
meant
the
absence
of
a
curtilage;
holding
that
a
building
as
few
as
three
or
four
feet
away
would
not
be
within
the
curtilage
if
it
was
not
within
a
common
enclosure.
there
must
be
different
rules
for
unfenced
property,
because
our
fence
rule
doesn't
dispose
of
it.
but
the
fence
rule,
which
is
the
rule
at
common
law,
we
think
is
the
kind
of
bright
line
that
could
appropriately,
consistently
with
fourth
amendment
values,
and
consistent
with
the
common
law,
be
applied.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
not
sure
why
that
outbuilding
should
be
considered
a
part
of
the
curtilage.
if
it's
the
area
over
which
the
animals
are
allowed
to
graze,
i
wonder
if
that's
an
area
that
is
really
protected
against
the
kind
of
trespass,
but
legal
trespass--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
if
the
outbuilding
is,
in
fact,
used
as
an
adjunct
to
the
domestic
economy,
we
would
not
urge
the
fence
rule;
that
is
not
this
case.
this
case
involves
a
barn
far
away
from
the
house;
not
used
for
domestic
purposes--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
in
the--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--in
the
exceptional
case,
where
an
outbuilding
is
truly
used
as
an
adjunct
to
the
domestic
economy,
it
may
be
deemed
within
the
curtilage.
it
may,
if
it's
the
equivalent
of
a
house,
it
may
have
its
own
curtilage.
but
for
at
least
a
starting
point,
at
least
a
strong
starting
point,
to
resolve
cases
other
than
that
exceptional
case
of
an
outbuilding
used
for
domestic
purposes,
we
think
the
fence
will
serve
very
well,
and
it's
quite
consistent
with
common
law.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
sixty
yards,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
and
we
think
that's
one
of
the
virtues
of
the
rule,
is
that
it
enables
the
property
owner
to
define
that
area
that
will
be
treated
as
a
whole
with
the
house,
and
not
just--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
we
have
not
attempted
to
set
a
specific
maximum
distance.
there
is,
of
course,
a
possibility
of
a
property
with
a
large
perimeter
fence
around
a
very
large
area,
which
does
not
in
any
sense
demarcate
the
yard
of
the
house,
or
what
we
think
should
be
called
curtilage.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
sixty
yards
we
think
would
be
too
much,
yes.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
i
think
it's
very
difficult
to
define
with
that
precision.
one
of
the
lower
courts
in
the
second
circuit--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--well,
that
is
why
we
propose
a
precise
fence
rule,
and
not
a
precise
distance
rule--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--which
will
resolve
the
many
cases
like
this
one
where
a
rural
property
is
surrounded
by
a...
the
house
on
a
rural
property
is
surrounded--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--i'm
satisfied
that
this
court
has
the
power
to
give
guidance
to
the
lower
courts
in
that
fashion,
yes,
your
honor.
especially
because,
as
i've
mentioned
several
times,
the
fence
rule
was
the
common
law
rule.
and
if
the
curtilage
concept--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--no,
your
honor,
but
the
purpose
of
a
fence
in
england
was
much
the
same
as
the
purpose
of
a
fence
in
texas
in
1980.
to
define
one
area
of
the
property--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--that,
also,
your
honor.
but
it
least
defines
some
part
of
the
property.
the
three-factor
test
of
care
v.
united
states
doesn't
set
any
rules,
but
it
also
gives
no
guidance.
it
leaves
the
courts
free
to
say,
first,
this
is
the
curtilage,
then
it
isn't
the
curtilage,
then
it
is
the
curtilage.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
if
it
were
a
house
that...
i'm
sorry,
your
honor,
if
it
were
a
fence
that
also
included
the
house,
i
think
it
would
define
the
curtilage.
if
it
were
just
a
fence
around
the
garden,
that
would
be
serving
the
purpose
of
defining
the
garden,
not
defining
the
area
closely
associated
with
the
home.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
perhaps
because
mr.
and
mrs.
dunn
had
not
moved
to
this
farm
yet,
they
hadn't
brought
the
dogs
yet;
i
don't
know.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
it
certainly
could
be,
your
honor,
if
it
had
been
converted
to
family
use.
we
would
readily
state
that
it
as
curtilage,
that
it
was
protected.
but
what
the
record
in
this
case
discloses
about
the
use
of
this
barn
is
that
mrs.
dunn
testified
that
it
was
used
for
nothing;
and
the
officers
could
see
with
the
aid
of
their
naked
eyesight
and
flashlights
that
it
was
used
for
a
drug
lab.
that's
all
this
barn
was
used
for.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
i
think
not,
your
honor.
i
don't
think
that's
the
kind
of
intimate
family
purpose
that
this
court
was
talking
about--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--justice
white,
that's
precisely
what
the
curtilage
doctrine
was
designed
to
protect
against.
it
was
designed
to
set
an
area
around
the
home
that
officers
could
not
invade--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--your
honor,
if
that
case
were
before
the
court--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--we
would
defend
the
officers'
action.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
your
honor,
the
fact
that
we
would
defend
that
action
if
we
had
to,
doesn't
mean
that
this
isn't
a
much
easier
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
all
right.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--because
it
could
be
seen
from
the
outside.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
this
court
held
in
the
lee
case,
and
reiterated
in
texas
v.
brown,
that
the
aid
of
a
flashlight
doesn't
convert
something
into
a
search
if
it
isn't
already
a
search.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
neither
of
those
cases
involved
shining
in
a
house,
nor
does
this
case
involve
shining
in
a
house.
it's
not
the
use
of
the
flashlight
that
would
make
peering
through
a
window--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--into
the
house
itself?
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
that
would
raise
very
different
constitutional
concerns
from
this
case.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
because
this
court
has
said
so
many
times
that
the
whole--
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
because
it's
a
barn
and
not
a
house.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
if
the
court
has
no
further
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
remainder
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
roy
t.
englert,
jr.
no
rebuttal,
your
honor.
