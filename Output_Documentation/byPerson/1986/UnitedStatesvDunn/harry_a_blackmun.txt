of
course,
your
bright
line
test
leaves
us
afloat
on
the
nearest
fence,
whatever
that
is.
suppose
it's
just
a
little
fence
around
a
small
garden.
the
property
owner
liked
to
garden,
and
he
wanted
to
keep
the
dogs
off
the
roses;
put
a
little
fence
around.
would
that
restrict
his
curtilage
to
that
first
fence?
justice
blackmun
where
were
the
dogs
in
this
case?
certainly
there
must
have
been
dogs
on
this
farm,
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
record.
