justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
do
you
think
your
fence
rule
should
apply
in
precisely
the
same
way
in
texas,
iowa,
and
say,
potomac,
maryland,
where
you
have
big
homes?
would
it
be
the
same
rule
in
a
big
suburb,
suburban
estate
and
a--
justice
stevens
--same
rule?
justice
stevens
does
your
rule
impose
a
maximum
distance
that
the
fence
can
be
from
the
house?
justice
stevens
but
i
gather
you
take
it
60
yards
would
be
too
much?
justice
stevens
and
do
you
think
there's
any
question
about
our
power
to
draw
such
a
line?
where
do
we
get
the
power
to
define
it
with
that
precision?
justice
stevens
but
if
you
don't
have
it
precisely
defined,
what
good
does
it
do
us?
justice
stevens
i
see.
justice
stevens
but
you're
satisfied
this
court
has
that
kind
of
rule-making
authority,
i
guess.
justice
stevens
yes,
but
you
know...
do
you
think
the
people
in
england
had
the
same
kinds
of
property
to
define
that
they
do
in
texas,
for
example?
justice
stevens
and
to
control
the
movement
of
animals,
i
suppose,
too.
justice
stevens
counsel,
you
cited
a
seventh
circuit
case,
but
i
don't
think
you
cited
it
in
your
brief,
and
i
don't
have
the
name
of
it.
could
you--
justice
stevens
--warth?
is
that
a
recent
case?
justice
stevens
and
was
that
a
barn
case?
justice
stevens
and
so
that
goes
to
the
original
question
presented
by
the
government
rather
than
the
revised
question,
not
whether
it's
in
the
curtilage,
but
whether
you
can
look
in
the
hole
in
the
barn?
justice
stevens
it
seems
to
me
that
your
25-mile
example
cuts
the
other
way,
because
congress
presumably...
must
have
assumed
that
you
can
go
and
make
such
searches
within
the
25-mile
area
without
violating
the
fourth
amendment?
