justice
byron
r.
white
so
you
would...
i
take
it
you
would
suggest,
then,
that
if
the...
if
the
utilities
said
to
the
commission,
we
don't
like
the
rates
you're
allowing,
we're
going
to
get
out
of
the
business
of
renting
to
these
people,
and
the
fcc
said,
sorry,
no,
you
can't
do
that,
even
if
it
were
a
taking,
there
would
be
just
compensation
in
their
price
formula?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
same
thing
would
go
for
the
company...
for
a
utility
that
had
never
been
in
the
business,
and
didn't
want
to
get
into
the
business,
and
the
fcc
ordered
it
to
get
into
the
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
take
it...
i
take
it
you
would
say
that
no
court
could
ever
define
that
fully
distributed
costs
would
afford
reasonable
compensation?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
that
what
you're
saying
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
could
it
ever?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
about
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so.
but
what
if
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
the
only
question
before
us
is
whether
this
is
a
confiscatory...
these
rates
are
confiscatory?
and
we
don't
think
they
are;
we
think
fully
distributed
costs
or
allocated
costs
with
a
profit
is
just
compensation.
justice
byron
r.
white
could
the
court
have
said
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
you
haven't
had
a...
you
weren't
allowed
to
make
a
record,
is
that
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
was
a
judicial
task,
not
an
administrative
task
to...
that's
what
they
said,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
classically
a
judicial
task?
now,
we're
going
to
perform.
we
think
that
allocated
are
perfectly
adequate.
justice
byron
r.
white
then
what
would
be
your
objection?
that
they
just
made
an
error
in
determining
it,
or...
a
procedural
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you're
saying
that
we
can't...
we
can't
decide
whether
these
rates
are
compensatory
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
wouldn't
you
be...
why
wouldn't
you
be
satisfied
with
a...
if
you
won,
in
the
sense
that...
that
we
would
say
that
just
compensation
is
not
measured...
necessarily
measured
by
allocating
costs,
and
that
the
record
is
insufficient,
and
send
it
back
to
the
fcc
or
send
it
back
to
some
court
to
determine?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
should
this
utility
get
any
more...
why
should
its
rates
for
renting
on
poles
be
established
by
any
different
formula
than
is
used
for
selling
gas
or
electricity?
justice
byron
r.
white
and...
why
would
that
measure
of
just
compensation
be
any
different
for
pole
rental
than
for
setting
the
rates
for
gas?
justice
byron
r.
white
if
a
state
said
to
the
contrary,
would
it
be
unconstitutional?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
just
said,
we're
going
to
treat
your
pole
rentals
just
like
we
do
everything
else,
as
part
of
your
utility
operation.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
we're
going
to
fix
the
rates
on
the
same
formula.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know,
but
it's
unconstitutional,
i
take,
under
your
view,
for
congress
to
treat
this
part
of
your
utility
business?
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
no
court
has
treated
it
that
way,
but
congress
seems
to
have.
