mr.
wallace,
does
the
act
and
does
the
fcc
permit
a
utility
company
to
terminate
a
pole
attachment
lease?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
take
the
position
that
under
the
act
the
utility
company
may
make
a
termination
for
some
reason
other
than
a
pretextual
one
to
avoid
the
act,
can
terminate?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
think
the
answer
to
that
may
be
a
factor
in
knowing
whether
there's
been
a
taking?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
topol,
all
of
this
argument,
it
seems
to
me,
presupposes
there's
been
a
taking.
and
i'm
not
certain
we've
gotten
over
that
hurdle
yet.
and
i'm
curious
to
know
whether
there's
a
taking
at
all.
and
in
knowing
whether
there's
a
taking,
part
of
the
inquiry,
in
determining
whether
a
rate
regulation
requirement,
which
this
is,
is
a
taking,
is
to
know
whether
it's
confiscatory.
now,
that's
a
different
question
from
determining
whether
there's
just
compensation,
once
you've
determined
there's
a
taking.
now,
maybe
the
fcc
and
the
courts
are
able,
on
this
record,
to
make
that
inquiry,
to
determine
whether
it's
confiscatory
and
whether
there's
been
a
taking.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
but
it
is
different
because
the
utilities
and
the
cable
companies
willingly
entered
into
leases
originally.
there
was
a
willingness
here
to
have
some
space
rental.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
how
does
that
differ
from
rent
control?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
i
think
you
have
a
real
hurdle
to
get
over
on
the
compulsory
aspects
of
loretto
which
aren't
present
here.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
how
does
that
differ
from
typical
restrictions
against
retaliatory
evictions
under
rent
control
laws?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
mr.
topol,
here
you
have
a
situation
where
the
utility
company
with
the
power
poles
and
the
easements
has
the
only
access
possible
for
cable
television
to
use.
i
mean,
it
is
a
natural
monopoly.
and
you're
trying
to
have
us
say
that
the
federal
government
can't
recognize
that
as
regulate
it
as
such.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
that
depends
on
whether
it's
a
taking
rather
than
a
monopoly
regulation.
