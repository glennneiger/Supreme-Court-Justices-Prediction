chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
next
in
two
consolidated
cases,
federal
communications
commission
against
florida
power
corporation;
and
group
w.
cable
against
florida
power
corporation.
mr.
wallace,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
ricks.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
ricks,
did
the
contract
give
the
utility
the
right
to
simply
go
out
of
the
business
of
renting
to
cable
tv
people?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
they
wouldn't
make
it
a
matter
of
principle,
so
to
speak?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
ricks.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
topol.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
why
can't
the
court
of
appeals,
reviewing
a
decision
of
the
fcc,
make
just
that
sort
of
inquiry?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
couldn't
the
court
of
appeals
so
indicate
in
an
opinion
reviewing
the
compensation
award
in
a
particular
case
that
there
was
not
enough
evidence
allowed
in
to
really
decide
what
just
compensation
was?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
but
we
don't
really
have
to
deal
with
every
conceivable
configuration
of
facts
that
might
come
up.
it's
just
a
question,
really,
of
whether
your
client
was
awarded
just
compensation,
or
nonconfiscatory
regulation
in
this
case.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
then
your
position
here
is
somewhat
different
than
that
taken
by
the
eleventh
circuit,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
would
we
simply
throw
out
the
statute
as
a
whole,
or
would
we
say,
it
may
well
be
bad
as
applied
to
some
cases,
but
we're
going
to
decide
on
a
case-by-case
basis?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace,
you
have
three
minutes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
at
one
o'clock.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinion
of
the
court
in
no.
85-1658,
federal
communications
commission
versus
florida
power
corporation
will
be
announced
by
justice
marshall.
