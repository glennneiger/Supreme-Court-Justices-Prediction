mr.
wallace,
before
you
go
on,
if
the
state
undertook
to
regulate
the
rate
itself,
would
the
federal
commission
then
not
regulate
the
rate
of
return?
justice

f.
powell,

mr.
wallace,
i
hate
to
cut
in
on
your
time,
but
it
would
help
me
if
you
could
tell
me
what
standard
should
be
applied
on
judicial
review
in
determining
whether
the
rate
is
just
and
reasonable?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
same
basis
as
is
applied
in
hope
natural
gas?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
what
effect
would
the
formula
have
on
the
application
of
that
standard?
