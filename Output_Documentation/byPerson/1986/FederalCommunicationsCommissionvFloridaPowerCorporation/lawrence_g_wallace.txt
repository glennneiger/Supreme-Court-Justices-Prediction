mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
pole
attachments
act
of
1978,
which
the
court
of
appeals
held
unconstitutional
in
this
case,
was
enacted
in
response
to
a
particular
concern
expressed
in
the
congressional
committee
reports
and
hearings,
and
in
a
staff
report
of
the
federal
communications
commission
that
was
submitted
to
congress.
that
concern
is
properly
understood
against
the
familiar
backdrop
of
state
public
utility
regulation,
under
which
electric
and
telephone
companies
are
granted
monopoly
power
through
franchising,
and
are
allowed
to
use
public
rights
of
way
for
their
poles,
or
to
acquire
easements
across
private
property
for
that
purpose,
sometimes
by
use
of
power
of
eminent
domain.
and
in
return
for
these
monopoly
privileges,
state
public
utilities
commissions
regulate
the
rates
that
the
utilities
can
charge
their
customers
to
assure
that
they
are
just
and
reasonable,
and
provide
a
fair
rate
of
return.
the
particular
concern
that
was
the
focus
of
congressional
attention
was
that
a
new
class
of
customers
of
these
utilities,
cablecasters,
who
were
renting
excess
space
on
the
utility
poles,
were
very
frequently
being
omitted
from
the
protection
of
rate
regulation
by
the
state
public
utilities
commission
while
being
subjected
to
the
superior
bargaining
position
of
the
utilities
companies
that
resulted
from
their
government-conferred
monopoly
power.
and
the
committee
reports
on
the
bill,
in
describing
the
testimony
before
congress,
are
replete
with
references
to
such
phrases
as
"superior
bargaining
position",
"exorbitant
rental
fees",
"extract
monopoly
rents",
"virtual
contracts
of
adhesion";
and
at
one
point
pointing
out
that
once
the
cablecaster
has
strung
his
wires
on
the
pole,
then
he
could
be
subjected
to
substantial
increases
in
rates
without
explanation
or
an
opportunity
for
negotiation.
so
congress'
solution
to
this
problem
that
had
been
brought
to
it
was
to
give
the
federal
communications
commission
authority
unless
and
until
the
state
commissions
asserted
jurisdiction
over
these
rates,
authority
to
resolve
disputes
between
the
contracting
parties
for
these
rentals
regarding
the
fairness
of
the
fees.
the
act
applies
only
if
the
utility
has
voluntarily
agreed
to
permit
an
attachment
by
cablecasters
to
its
poles.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question,
mr.
justice.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
recent
amendments
require
sharing
of
the
rights
of
way,
but
doesn't
refer
to
a
requirement
that
an
attachment
be
made
to
the
poles.
the
commission
has
not
yet
construed
the
new
amendments.
they're
not
at
issue
in
this
case.
put
the
most--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--there
is
no
indication
in
the
record
that
there
was
any
compulsion.
so
far
as
we
know--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
appellees
voluntarily
wished
to
rent
the
excess
space
on
their
poles.
they
did
not
submit
any
evidence
to
the
contrary.
and
that
would
have
been
their
burden,
mr.
justice.
so
the
act
applies
only
when
there
has
been
an
agreement
by
the
utility
company
to
rent
excess
space
on
its
poles.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
is
no
doubt
that
if
the
contracts,
as
they
typically
do
and
as
these
do,
give
the
utility
company
the
right
to
reclaim
the
space
for
its
own
purposes,
that
it
can
do
that.
if
there
is
no
such
term
in
the
contract,
then
it
is
an
open
question
whether
the
utility
company
could,
under
the
act,
terminate.
there
has
been
no
attempt
to
terminate.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
commission
has
not
yet
taken
a
position
on
that.
it's
really
a
double
question
in
the
commission's
mind.
there's
no
doubt
that
the
utility
company,
if
it
needed
the
space
itself,
could
reclaim
the
space
even
without
a
contractual
provision
reserving
the
right
to
do
so.
the
open
question
is
whether
if
the
cablecaster
then
offered
to
build
a
taller
pole,
or
to
bear
the
expense
of
whatever
is
needed
in
order
that
its
cable
could
still
be
accommodated,
whether
the
utility
company
would
have
to
accede
to
that
request
or
not.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
may
in
a
case
that
raises
that.
but
that's
not...
there's
been
no
effort
by
the
appellees
in
this
case
to
terminate
their
contracts.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
what
this
case--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--resembles.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there's...
there's
no
doubt
that
it
would
be
prohibited.
but
the
appellees
here
have
never
said
that
they
would
prefer
not
to
have
the
cables
at
all,
rather
than
to
get
the
lower
rates.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
we're
not
saying
that
they
volunteered
to
rent
it
at
this
price.
we're
saying
that
they
volunteered
to
rent
the
space
for
this
purpose.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
and
that
this
is
a
compatible
purpose
with
the
use
of
their
poles.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
this
is
precisely
the
distinction
that
this
case
turns
on.
because
in
this
case
appellees
wish,
and
still
wish,
for
all
that
appears,
to
rent
this
excess
space
on
their
poles
to
cablecasters
at
the
contractually
specified
rates.
and
it
is
only
the
rate
regulation
to
which
they
are
objecting.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
the
only
purpose
for
which
they
are
selling
electricity
to
their
other
customers.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
but
the
rates
are
still
regulated.
and
the
question
is
whether
they
have
a
different
constitutional
privilege
with
respect
to
these
sales.
that
is
the
question.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
the
commission
has
authority
only
to
fill
a
regulatory
gap
unless
and
until
the
state
commission
asserts
jurisdiction
over
these
rates.
now--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--incremental
costs,
we
call
it,
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
no,
your
honor,
they
have
taken
the
position
that
if
they
are
reducing
the
rate
from
the
contract
rate,
they
can
only
reduce
it
to
the
maximum
allowable
under
the
statute,
which
is
the
so-called
fully
allocated
cost.
and
that
includes
a
component
for
the
so-called
cost
of
capital,
and
namely,
a
component
for
a
fair
rate
of
return
on
the
investment,
which
they
calculate
by
reference
to
what
the
state
public
utility
commission
uses.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
does.
because
the
complaint
is
solely
about
the
rates,
and
not
being
allowed
to
adhere
to
the
contractual
rates,
rather
than
about
the
attachment
itself,
what
we
have
here
is
an
objection
to
the
statute
which,
while
it's
in
the
form
of
a
takings
complaint,
the
objection
is
at
bottom
a
complaint
of
loss
of
a
business
opportunity
or
of
interference
with
contractual
freedom.
and
of
course
entirely
valid
regulation
of
commerce
characteristically
restricts
business
or
contractual
opportunities
that
would
otherwise
exist.
obvious
illustrations
would
be
the
fair
labor
standards
act;
the
securities
laws;
the
food
and
drug
laws;
the
oil
price
controls
of
a
few
years
ago.
this
is
the
commonest
element
of
regulation
of
commerce.
and
to
bring
the
examples
closer
to
home
here,
under
this
court's
jurisprudence
upholding
public
utility
rate
regulation,
appellees
would
clearly
be
precluded
from
making
any
claim
that
the
state
has
taken
their
property
rights
in
their
inventory
of
electric
energy
by
restricting
the
price
at
which
it
may
be
sold
to
just
and
reasonable
rates,
even
though
a
property
owner's
bundle
of
rights
includes
a
right
to
alienate.
now,
in
this
case,
the
owner
has
chosen
to
alienate
only
a
leasehold
interest,
rather
than
title
to
the
property.
but
that
is
no
reason
for
a
different
result
with
respect
to
rate
regulation.
in
the
factual
context
we
have,
the
statutory
rate
regulation
is
a
form
of
rent
control.
it
regulates
the
rental
rate.
and
like
other
instances
of
rate
regulation,
rent
control,
if
nonconfiscatory,
is
constitutionally
permissible,
and
does
not
constitute
a
taking
of
property.
that
is
what
this
court's
opinion
strongly
indicated
in
loretto
v.
teleprompter,
and
that
is
what
eight
justices
squarely
held
in
dismissing
for
want
of
a
substantial
federal
question
a
constitutional
challenge
to
the
cambridge,
massachusetts
rent
control
ordinance
in
fresh
pond
shopping
center
against
callahan,
even
though
the
present
chief
justice
in
dissent
correctly
pointed
cut
that
a
takings
question
under
the
fifth
and
fourteenth
amendments
was
presented,
and
that
the
questions
might
be
postponed
or
avoided,
if
i
may
quote,
if
the
case
were
here
on
certiorari.
but
the
case
is
in
an
appeal.
we
act
on
the
merits,
whatever
we
do,
unquote.
so
our
primary
submission,
relying
on
the
rent
control
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
is
that
the
federal
act
does
not
effect
a
taking
of
appellees'
property.
our
brief
also...
also
shows
that
the
statutory
scheme,
in
any
event,
provides
the
appellees
with
just
compensation.
they
claim
that
the
statutory
formula
falls
short
of
awarding
them
market
value.
but
in
the
factual
context
we
have
here,
their
use
of
the
term,
market
value,
is
a
mere
euphemism
for
monopoly
profits
to
which
there
is
no
constitutional
entitlement.
and
contrary
to
appellees'
further
contention,
the
reviewing
court
is
fully
able
in
these
cases
to
hear
constitutional
as
well
as
statutory
claims.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
our
position,
mr.
justice.
there
has
been
litigation
about
the
details
of
the
formula,
but
if
you
look
at
the
statute
at
the
very
end
of
the
appendix
to
our--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
would
follow
under
that
approach
to
it,
that
that
would
amount
to
a
taking
for
a
public
use
for
which
just
compensation
was
provided.
the
statutory
formula
is
quite
malleable,
and
can
be
expanded
in
application
to
include
elements
that
a
reviewing
court
would
believe
required
in
order
to
afford
just
compensation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
there
would
be
a
problem
if
there
were
a
taking.
but
our
primary
submission
is
that
there
is
no
taking,
so
you
don't
have
to
reach
of
whether
there--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--that
is
correct.
but--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
two
questions
are
intertwined.
the
jurisprudence
says
that
nonconfiscatory
rate
regulation
is
not
a
taking.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
in
the
permian
basin
cases
the
court
did
say
that
the
statutory
inquiry
in
what
is
a
just
and
reasonable
rate
basically
coincides
with
the
constitutional
standard
of
just
compensation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
i
think
it's
here
in
the
sense
that
we
submit
that
the
statute
does
provide
a
nonconfiscatory
system
of
rate
regulation.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time,
if
i
may.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
same
standard
that's
applied
in
permian
basic
and
hope
natural
gas.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly
the
same
standard.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
provides
guidance
for
the
commission
that
the
court
should
review
the
adequacy
of
to
meet
that
standard.
now,
the
record
that
was
before
the
commission
by
appellees
is
precisely
the
record
that
they
chose
to
make.
the
commission
did
not
reject
anything
that
they
submitted.
and
the
commission's
consistent
practices
in
these
cases
has
been
to
accept
evidence
in
the
form
of
affidavits
or
documentary
evidence
of
any
nature
that
the
companies
wish
to
submit,
even
if
the
commission
thinks
the
evidence
is
irrelevant
for
their
purposes.
they
simply
have
been
putting
it
in
the
file,
and
it
becomes
part
of
the
agency
record.
there's
no
inability
of
a
company
to
establish
a
record
for
purposes
of
judicial
review.
on
page
21
of
our
brief
we
cite
the
statute...
or
27
of
our
brief,
we
cite
the
statutory
authority
for
the
reviewing
court
to
decide
the
constitutional
as
well
as
statutory
claims.
and
the
d.c.
circuit
it
held
it
had
that
authority
in
an
opinion
by
judge
bork
for
a
unanimous
panel
that
include
then-judge
scalia.
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
the
case
is
submitted.
