mr.
allan
j.
topol
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
be
clear
as
to
what
it
is
that
this
case
is
about,
and
what
the
defect
is
that
we
see
in
the
statute.
congress
prescribed
a
binding
formula
for
the
determination
of
the
rates
that
utilities
could
charge
cable
companies.
and
this
is
an
important
point,
because
mr.
wallace
indicated
that
the
statute
is
mushy;
that
it
could
expand...
the
scheme
was
"malleable",
his
term...
it
could
expand
to
provide
just
compensation.
with
all
due
respect,
i
believe
that's
incorrect.
the
statute,
at
pages...
page
51a
of
the
government's
appendix,
indicates
congress
set
a
formula.
it
said,
you
may
not
require
the
payment
of
less
than
x
dollars,
x
being
incremental
costs;
but
you
may
not
permit
the
payment
of
more
than
y
dollars,
y
being
the
term
that's
tossed
around
in
the
briefs
as
allocated
costs.
and
in
our
view,
herein
lies
the
defect
in
this
statutory
situation.
congress,
which
has
taken
the
property,
congress
which
has
authorized
the
taking,
is
the
same
body
which
has
fixed
the
compensation.
it
has
done
so
by
means
of
a
formula:
not
less
than
x
and
not
more
than
y.
and
in
our
system
of
jurisprudence,
or
the
authorities
i'm
going
to
discuss,
congress
can't
both
take
the
property
and
determine
the
compensation.
the
congress
can
take
the
property.
it
can
get
into
the
fray
between
utilities
and
catv
companies
if
it
wants
to.
it
can
say,
as
between
two
monopolists,
the
cable
people
who
have
a
monopoly
in
their
area,
and
the
utilities
who
have
a
monopoly
for
utility
service,
it
can
address
the
problem.
but
having
decided
to
take,
having
decided
to
have
utility
customers
subsidize,
in
essence,
catv
customers
by
taking
utility
property,
it
can't
then
fix
the
rate
of
compensation.
and
that's
our
difficulty
with
this
statute.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
i
don't
think
it
can,
your
honor.
because
i
think
the
question
of
just
compensation
is
a
case-by-case
determination.
and
as
this
court
said
in
the
monongahela
navigation
case
is,
once
the
congress
takes,
the
court
has
to
determine.
now
the
question
is,
how
in
each
case
is
the
court
going
to
determine
what's
just
compensation?
the
cases
of
this
court,
for
example,
the
564
acres
case,
says,
the
standard
for
just
compensation
is
what
will
put
the
party
in
the
same
pecuniary
situation
as
he
would
have
been
had
there
been
no
taking.
that's
$6
for
us
in
this
situation.
the
olson
case
says,
the
standard
of
just
compensation
is
fair
market
value.
it
explicitly
says
in
olson,
which
we
quote
in
our
brief,
that
it's
not
enough
to
look
at
costs
and
to
look
at
investment.
the
inquiry
as
to
just
compensation
has
to
be
broader.
and--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
the
difficulty
with
that
is
because
the
fcc
is
not
having
a
proceeding
before
it
with
a
wide
open
record
in
which
it's
permitting
evidence
to
come
in
that
would
be
relevant
to
the
inquiry
of
just
compensation;
for
example,
evidence
as
to
market
price;
evidence
as
to
what
we
charge
other
customers.
economic
testimony.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
well,
what
the
eleventh
circuit
was
saying
in
this
case,
your
honor,
is
that
the
statutory
scheme
is
such
that
that
kind
of
evidence
can
never
end
up
being
presented
before
the
fcc.
in
order
to
have
the
fcc
make
that
kind
of
broad
inquiry,
this
court
would
have
to
rewrite
the
statute.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
your
honor,
i
think
that's
correct.
and
i
think
from
the
record
evidence,
given
the
fact
that
the
fcc
was
operating
with
such
a
very,
very
narrow
inquiry
and
a
narrow
record,
in
this
statutory
scheme,
that
is
simply
impossible
for
a
reviewing
court
to
make
a
determination
on.
and
that's
what
bothered
the
eleventh
circuit.
we
didn't
have
an
opportunity
for
a...
had
this
statutory
scheme
said,
very
broadly,
the
fcc
should
make
a
determination
of
just
compensation
in
a
constitutional
sense,
and
that
decision
would
be
reviewed
by
an
appellate
court,
then
we
would
have
no
difficulty
with
that
scheme.
but
our
difficulty
is
the
fact
that
the
fcc
isn't
given
the
broad
latitude
to
make
a
determination,
and
indeed,
to
make
a
record,
even,
with
respect
to
just
compensation
in
a
constitutional
sense.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
i
don't
believe
so,
your
honor.
i
mean,
i
believe
that
what
the
eleventh
circuit
said
the
defect
in
this
statute
was,
and
they
quoted
specifically
from
the
monongahela
navigation
case,
if
i
may,
to
read
just
two
sentences,
because
i
think
that's
the
essence.
it's
the
key
quote
in
the
eleventh
circuit
and
it's
the
essence
of
our
argument,
is
the
court...
this
court,
in
the
navigation
case,
said:
it
does
not
rest
with
the
public
taking
the
property
through
congress
or
the
legislature,
its
representative,
to
say
what
compensation
shall
be
paid,
or
even
what
shall
be
the
rule
of
compensation.
the
constitution
has
declared
that
just
compensation
shall
be
paid,
and
the
ascertainment
of
that
is
a
judicial
inquiry.
now,
we've
heard
a
lot
of
discussion,
after
all,
these
are
monopoly
profits
and
this
is
ridiculous.
and
you
have
a
monopoly
in
the
area.
and
it
shouldn't
be
$6
a
pole;
it
should
be
$1.79.
on
this
issue
of
whether
or
not
there
was
just
compensation,
there's
only
one
court
decision...
court
decision
outside
of
the
rubric
of
this
statute.
and
it's
interesting.
it's
the
continental
cable
television,
a
1983
sixth
circuit
opinion
which
is
discussed
on
page
36
of
our
brief.
it
came
up
from
the
district
court.
it
involved
section
2
charges,
the
charges
that
the
utility
were
monopolizing,
and
there
was
also
a
counter-claim
in
quasi-contract
or
unjust
enrichment
for
pole
space
that
was
occupied
that
wasn't
subject
to
contract.
and
in
that
case,
the
issue
was...
factual
issue...
what's
a
reasonable
rate
for
a
pole
attachment?
and
a
district
court...
which
incidentally,
didn't...
it
could
have
followed
the
statute
and
come
out
with
something
like
$1.79,
but
it
didn't.
the
district
court
decision
in
that
case
came
up
with
a
conclusion
of
$5.60
per
pole
was,
quote,
reasonable.
that
decision
was
affirmed
by
the
sixth
circuit,
by
the
court
of
appeals.
now,
i'm
not
asking
this
court
to
endorse
$5.60,
or
any
other
number.
but
what
i'm
saying
is,
this
is
the
only
district
court
decision,
the
only
court
decision,
judicial
inquiry.
this
really
puts
us
on--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--justice
white,
what
i'm
saying
is
that--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court
can't
say
that
allocated
costs
will
constitute
just
compensation
in
all
cases.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
it's
conceivable
in
a
case,
perhaps...
perhaps--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--i
don't
think
it
can,
because
in
this
case
the
fcc
was
operating
with
a
very,
very
narrow
standard
and
very
narrow--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--well,
your
honor,
the
court
couldn't--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--i
don't
think
so.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
that's
precisely
correct.
because
the
fcc
didn't
have
that
kind
of
broad
mandate.
i
mean,
we
could
rewrite
the
statute,
and
we
could
take
out
the
section
i
read
that
says,
you
apply...
you
determine
just
compensation
not
less
than
x--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--that's
correct.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
i
don't
believe,
your
honor,
that
a
court
can
perform--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--no,
your
honor,
my
objection
would
be
that
the
statutory
scheme
doesn't
permit
the
fcc
to
make
the
kind
of
broad-ranging
inquiry;
it
doesn't
permit
that
kind
of
factual
determination
before
the
fcc
to
permit
that
kind
of
record.
i
mean,
we
would
have
to
rewrite
the
statute.
if
we
rewrote
the
statute
and
we
said,
the
fcc
may
make
a
finding,
may
consider
evidence
and
make
a
finding
as
constitutional
fifth
amendment
to
just
compensation
in
a
sense,
and
that
should
be
reviewed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
then
i
would
have
no
difficulty.
but
that,
your
honor,
is
a
different
statute.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
in
the
same
sense,
your
honor,
if
congress
passed
a
law
that
said
homeowners...
somebody
purchased
a
piece
of
property
for
$50,000;
put
$10,000
in
it
in
terms
of
costs
and
improvements.
and
congress
passed
a
law
that
said,
in
taking
a
highway,
no
person
shall
get
more
than
the
cost
that
he
paid
plus
the
amount
that
he
put
in.
if
i
had
evidence,
and
the
evidence
showed
that
the
fair
market
value
of
that
house
was
$300,000,
surely
we
wouldn't
let
congress
pass
a
law
that
says
the
most
i
could
get
for
that
property
is
$60,000.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
your
honor...
and
i
recognize,
of
course,
it's
only
as
a
last
resort
that
we
throw
out
a
statute,
but
i
think
that
we
couldn't
make
the
inquiry
in
a
case-by-case
interpretation
without
rewriting
the
statute.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
well,
the
difficulty
with
that
is...
i
mean,
i'd
obviously
be
happy
with
the
victory.
but
the
difficulty,
your
honor,
is
that
it
would
be
inconsistent
with
the
statute.
and
this
court
would
then
be
rewriting
the
statute.
and
that
would
be
my
difficulty.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
your
honor,
let
me
address
that
taking
issue
and
respond
to
your
question,
because
in
a
sense,
you're
absolutely
correct.
the
first
issue:
is
there
a
taking?
and
if
there
is,
we
go
to
just
compensation.
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
there
is
a
taking,
we
believe
that
the
loretto
case
decided
by
this
court
in
1983
is
dispositive
on
that
issue.
in
loretto--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--your
honor,
i
have
two
responses
to
that.
the
first
is
that
in
loretto,
there
was
a
willingness
to
enter
into,
because
loretto's
predecessor,
from
whom
she
bought
the
building,
willing
let
the
cable
people
on
in
loretto;
so
there
was
voluntary.
but
secondly,
i
would
say
here,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
did,
what
florida
power
did
was
to
voluntarily
let
the
cable
people
on
at
$6
a
pole.
they
didn't
voluntarily
let
the
cable--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--well,
your
honor,
i
think
it
differs
under
the
distinction
that
this
court
made
in
the
loretto
case.
what
this
court
said
is
that
we
will
accord
permanent
physical
occupations
a
greater
standard
of
constitutional
protection.
where
there
is
a
permanent
physical
occupation,
we
will
decide,
we
will
conclude,
that
there
is
a
per
se
taking.
and
in
other
regulatory
situations...
we've
heard
about
grain
elevators
and
other
kind
of
regulation...
this
court,
i
think,
made
that
distinction.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
well,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
the
compulsory
aspects
of
loretto,
as
to
whether
we
put
them
on,
there
was
a
dialogue
on
the
opening
colloquy
on
the
question
of,
can
we
take
them
off?
and
i
really
think
that's
the
key
inquiry.
and
judge
scalia
asked
the
question,
he
indicated,
well,
that
the
fcc
had
moved
by
adjudication.
suppose
they'd
moved
by
regulation?
and
indeed,
and
we
quote
on
page
16
and
17
of
our
brief,
an
fcc
regulation
which
says
that
the
commission
will
have
jurisdiction
under
these
rules,
where
the
utility
has
discontinued
cable
tv
attachments
in
order
to
avoid
commission
jurisdiction.
and
then
we
have
three
cases.
we
have
the
ones
that
we
cite
at
17
and
18.
contrary
to
the
position
taken
by
the
appellant,
in
those
cases,
on
pages
17
and
18,
the
whitney,
tele-communications
and
bailey,
people
tried
to
discontinue
their
contracts.
they
said
in
a
couple
of
these
cases,
in
two
of
the
cases,
they
said
safety
factors;
we
want
to
throw
the
people
off.
and
back
came
the
response
from
the
fcc:
if
the
real
reason
you're
throwing
them
off
is
because
you
don't
like
the
rates
we're
setting,
then
you
can't
do
it
on
the
statutory
scheme.
now,
to
me,
that
seems
more
permanent
than--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--well,
it's
not
retaliatory
evictions.
it's
the
fact
that...
as
the
question
was
put...
if
we
didn't
like
the
$1.79.
suppose
we
wanted
to
throw
them
off,
and
then
leave
the
poles
idle
and
wait
for
a
better
offer
to
come.
i
mean,
after
all,
this
court
has
seen
in
the
los
angeles
case,
there
may
come
a
time
when
there's
competition
in
the
cable
business;
more
than
one
company
may
want
to
service
an
area.
suppose
we
wanted
to
say,
we
won't
take
$1.79.
we'll
sit
with
empty
poles.
that's
not
retaliatory.
it's
certainly
avoiding
the
fcc's
jurisdiction.
we
can't
do
it.
we'd
be
stuck.
in
loretto,
loretto
was
better
off
than
we
were.
she
could
have
converted
her
building
to
a
condominium
at
any
time.
she
could
have
gotten
out
of
the
residential
rental
business
at
any
time;
avoided
the
new
york
statute.
we
can't
do
that.
our
poles
are
there,
and
our
utility
system
is
there.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
no,
your
honor.
but
what
i
would
say
is
where
i
think
this
case
should
be
treated
as
a
taking
is
because
of
the
amazing
similarity
between
this
case
and
the
loretto
case.
i
mean,
loretto
was
a
catv
case.
it
involved
precisely
the
same
type
of
hookups:
plates,
wires,
screws,
bolts.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
well,
it's
not,
your
honor,
but--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--well,
i
think,
your
honor,
that
comes
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
there's
been
a
taking,
i
mean
which
i
think
is
the
initial
question.
if
there's
been
a
taking
under
loretto,
then
we're
entitled
to
the
fifth
amendment
just
compensation
test.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
because
this
court
has
spoken
in
a
number
of
cases,
your
honor,
as
to
what
just
compensation
means
in
a
constitutional
sense.
i
mean,
it
said,
for
example,
in
the
564
acres,
it's
what
it
takes
to
put
the
party
back
in
the
same
position
it
would
have
been
pecuniarily
had
the
property
not
been
taken.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
but
your
honor,
let
me
respond
to
the
two
points.
on
the
first
point,
the
question
of
whether
or
not
this
is
subject
to
the
regulation,
what
i
submit
is
that
under
the
loretto
case,
the
distinction
the
court
made,
we
have
the
type
of
permanent
physical
occupation.
this
court
created
a
dichotomy
between
permanent
physical
occupation
and
regulation.
here
we
have
precisely
the
same
type
of
occupation
as
in
loretto.
it
would
really
do
violence
to
the
distinction
made
to
say,
here,
no
taking.
but
in
addition,
i
would
submit
that
the
distinction
this
court
in
loretto
made
sense.
we
live
in
a
highly
regulated
society.
we're
subject
to
all
types
of
regulations,
as
loretto
was,
as
my
utility
clients
are.
we
always
wrestle
in
this
court
with
the
question
of,
how
much
is
too
far?
how
far
can
the
government
go?
this
court
in
loretto
said,
when
we
get
to
the
point
of
permanent
physical
occupations,
that's
too
far.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
no,
but
there
is
a
different
situation
in
that
the
telephone
companies
are
subject
to
a
state
regulation
across
the
board,
i
mean,
which
is
a
difference;
whereas
the
catv
companies
aren't.
and
with
respect
to
the
question
of
whether
this
is
just
another
aspect
of
the
utility
business
is...
we
have
a
number
of
cases
that
we
refer
to
in
our
briefs
in
which
state
and
federal
courts
have
expressly
concluded
that
space
on
utility
poles
constitutes
private
property
that
cannot
be
taken
by
means
of
physical
attachments
without
just
compensation.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
it
doesn't
require
them
to
make
any
new
attachments,
no,
the
statute--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--i
believe
it
did.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
well,
with
this
statute...
i
don't
think
so,
your
honor.
because
in
both
cases,
we
have
the
attachment
situation.
the
question
is:
what
should
be
the
compensation?
mr.
allan
j.
topol
well,
i
guess
there
are
two
distinctions,
your
honor.
the
first
is
that
in
loretto,
loretto's
predecessor
voluntarily
agreed--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--yes,
but
in
this
situation,
your
honor,
what
is
it
florida
power
agreed
to
do?
it
agreed--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--yes,
it
agreed
to
put
them
on
at
$7.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
that's
correct.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
well,
your
honor...
well,
i
guess
because
the
courts
have
provided
in
a
number
of
cases,
most
importantly,
from
florida
as
well,
that
the
business
of
renting
space
on
poles
is
not
part
of
our
public
utility
business.
and
we've
got
the
reference
on
page
24
and
25
of
our
brief
to
the
florida
case.
we've
a
number
of
cases
from
other
states
which
have
held
that
when
you
rent
space
on
your
poles,
that's
not
part
of
your
public
utility
operation.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
i
think
if
there
was
a
state...
yes.
well,
if
there
was
a
taking
of
property,
as
this
is--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--yes--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--yes,
your
honor,
if
they
said
that,
then
we
would
argue,
because
this
is
not
part
of
our
utility
business,
that
there
would
be
a
taking,
and
we
would
have
a
right
to
just
compensation
in
a
fifth
amendment
sense.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
i
suppose
it
could,
your
honor,
but
no
courts
to
my
knowledge
have
done
that.
the
position
taken
is
that
this
is
not
part
of
your
public
utility
business.
that's
certainly
the
case
in
florida,
and
it's
the
case
in
a
number
of
other...
in
a
number
of
other
situations.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
that's
correct.
i
would...
i
would...
i
guess--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--congress
has.
well,
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
we
basically
hold...
the
analysis
is
twofold.
one,
we
argue
that
there
is
a
taking
in
the
loretto
sense.
when
one
looks
at
loretto,
it's
catv,
it's
hookups,
it's
screws,
it's
bolts,
it's
precisely
the
same
kind
of
hardware.
the
voluntary
nature,
given
what
the
fcc
has
said
in
its
regulations
and
in
its
cases,
it's
not
voluntary
as
to
florida
power.
so
given
the
fact
that
the
hookup's
the
same;
given
the
fact
that
there's
no
voluntariness;
the
first
part
of
our
argument
is
that
we
have
a
taking.
and
it
seems
to
me
it
would
distort,
as
the
eleventh
circuit
found,
the
meaning
of
loretto
to
say,
we're
going
to
carve
out
an
exception
here.
and
i
would
really--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--no,
your
honor,
i'm
not.
what
i'm
saying
is,
indeed,
the
federal
government
can
even
authorize
the
taking.
but
once
it
does
so,
it
has
to
provide
for
a
judicial
vehicle
for
determination
of
just
compensation.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
guess
my
situation
is...
my
feeling
is
that
the
loretto
situation
involved,
again,
monopoly
aspects
in
the
same
sense.
i
mean,
loretto
was
the
owner
of
that
particular
apartment
building.
one
had
to
go
through
that
apartment
building.
i
have
difficulty
finding
any
distinction
between
this
factual
situation
and
loretto.
and
i'm
persuaded
that
the
distinction
the
court
made
in
loretto
between
permanent
physical
occupations
and
other
regulation
for
purposes
of
the
taking
argument,
made
very
good
sense.
so
i
would
urge
you
to
continue
the
loretto
analysis
and
find
no
distinction.
having
made
that
conclusion,
hopefully
first,
then
i
would
say,
if
there's
a
taking,
we
really
are
up
against
monongahela
navigation,
and
should
the
congress
really
be
permitted
to
determine
in
a
taking
case,
it's
going
to
be
not
less
than
x
and
not
more
than
y.
and
under
the
jurisprudence
of
this
court,
i
have
a
lot
of
difficulty
with
that
conclusion;
any
more
than
the
department
of
highways
should
be
able
to
take
someone's
property
and
say
to
that
person,
you
will
receive
only
your
costs,
or
your
costs
plus
any
improvements
to
the
property.
that's
not
our
legal
standard.
our
legal
standard
is,
you
have
a
judicial
determination
of
just
compensation.
and
it
seems
to
me
what
this
court
could
say
to
the
congress
is,
you
didn't
provide
that
mechanism
in
this
statute.
you
boxed
in
the
determination
of
just
compensation.
rewrite
it,
and
say
in
broad
terms...
leave
the
fcc
in
the
act.
the
fcc
makes
a
recommendation
first
as
to
whether
or
not
there's
just
compensation
in
a
fifth
amendment
sense,
hearing
all
the
evidence
in
a
full
proceeding
directed
to
that
issue.
if
the
statute
were
rewritten
in
this
form,
if
the
court
said
to
the
congress,
it
has
to
be
rewritten
in
that
form
to
survive
the
constitutional
challenge,
then
congress
could
do
it
and
we
could
deal
with
the
issue.
but
there's
a
terribly,
terribly
important
principle.
and
it's
the
question...
back
to
monongahela
navigation...
should
we
let
the
congress,
which
is
doing
the
taking,
if
we
find
there's
a
taking,
should
we
let
the
body,
the
congress,
that's
doing
the
taking,
be
the
one
to
make
the
determination
as
to
just
compensation?
and
we
really
feel,
it
shouldn't.
so
i
guess
at
bottom
line
we've
got,
our
two
basic
issues
are,
one,
we
feel
that
under
this
court's
decision
in
loretto...
and
we
talk
about
the
utility
cases
on
poles
and
pole
space...
we
believe
under
loretta
there
is
a
taking.
and
to
create
an
artificial
distinction--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--that's
correct.
mr.
allan
j.
topol
that's
correct,
your
honor.
but
here
we
have
a...
we're
back
to
the
loretto
distinction.
and
this
court
carved
out
and
said,
permanent
physical
occupations
should
be
accorded
a
higher
standard--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--well,
the
agency
can
have
the
first
cut
at
it
if
the
agency's
standard
is
just
compensation
in
a
constitutional
sense.
i'd
have
no
problem
with
the
agency
having
the
first
cut
at
it,
if--
mr.
allan
j.
topol
--well,
here
the
agency's
operating
under
the
standard
that
congress
set.
and
that,
we
submit,
is
not
a
constitutional
standard.
