mr.
topol,
does
this
statute
require
your
client
to
make
any
new
attachments?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
statute
in
loretto
require
landlords
who
did
not
previously
have
cables
affixed
to
them--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
isn't
that
a
rather
important
difference?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
one
is
a
statute
that
only
applies
that
have
been
accepted
voluntarily,
and
the
other
is
a
statute
that
compels
the
landlord
to
accept
those
he
didn't
want.
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
understand
on
the
particular
facts
of
that
particular
landlord.
but
the
statute
generally
covered
landlords
who
had
not
previously
agreed
to
the
attachment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
different
price.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
say
that
you're
compelled
to
stay
in
business.
but
you're
compelled
to
stay
in
the
electric
business,
too.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
why
isn't
the
state
statute
a
taking
by
an
equal...
by
the
same
argument?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
is
the
question
of
whether
it's
part
of
your
utility
business
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law?
i
mean,
can't
the
state
say,
well,
we're
going
to
define
the
regulated
business
to
encompass
this
particular
activity?
