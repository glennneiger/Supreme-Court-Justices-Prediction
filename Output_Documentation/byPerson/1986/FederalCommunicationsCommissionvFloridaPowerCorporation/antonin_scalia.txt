voluntarily?
what
if
the
state
requires
it
to
agree?
don't
some
states
require
the
utilities
to
provide
pole
attachments?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'd
be
very
surprised
if
they
didn't.
is
there
a
federal
act
that
now
requires
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
know
that
all
the
contracts
at
issue
here
were
not
entered
into
under
compulsion
of
state
law?
justice
antonin
scalia
nor
that
there
wasn't?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
let's
talk
about
termination
for
what
your
brief
and
the
fcc
calls
a
pretextual
reason,
that
is,
terminating
simply
because
the
utility
just
doesn't
believe
the
amount
of
money
it's
getting
from
this
thing
is
worth
its
trouble.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
is
there
any
doubt
that
that
would
be
prohibited
by
the
fcc?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
is
that
a
condition
to
their
asserting
that
this
is
not
a
voluntary
arrangement,
as
you're
maintaining
it
is?
what
is
the
regulations
had
said
the
same
thing?
the
fcc
has
done
this
by
adjudication,
but
could
as
well
have
said
in
the
regulation,
anybody
who's
in
a
contract
shall
not
be
able
to
get
out
simply
because
we're
requiring
a
lower
rate?
if
it
said
that
in
the
regulation,
i
don't
think
we
would
require
the
utility
to
try
to
get
out
of
the
contract
before
it
could
come
before
us
and
say...
and
say,
this
is
not
a
voluntary
agreement
that
we're
in.
we're
in
an
involuntary
agreement.
justice
antonin
scalia
oh,
well,
i
see.
justice
antonin
scalia
don't
you
think
it's
important
that
they
volunteered
to
do
it
for
a
price?
justice
antonin
scalia
xxx
the
purpose
for
which
they
rented
it
was
to
make
money
on
it.
i
mean,
to
say
that
that's
a
minor
detail
of
the
voluntariness
seems
to
me
absurd.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
in
the
rates
that
the
fcc...
the
statute
sets
forth
what
the
rates
that
the
fcc...
the
range
that
the
fcc
can
impose,
right?
and
the
bottom
level
of
that
range,
as
i
understand
it,
is
essentially
marginal
cost.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
and
that's
essentially
what
the
fcc
has
been
using,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
it
does
include
fully
distributed
cost,
then?
justice
antonin
scalia
do
we
have
to
approve
the
entire
statutory
formula
in
order
to
agree
if
you
here?
if
the
fcc
were
giving...
were
giving
compensation
only
at
marginal
cost,
i'd
have...
wouldn't
there
be
some
problem
with
that?
justice
antonin

justice
antonin
scalia
in
hope
natural
gas
could
the
utility
commission
have
allowed
the
gas
company
to
charge
only
marginal
cost
for
all
of
its
products?
certainly
not.
when
you
charge
marginal
cost
for
some,
you're
going
to
have
to
charge
well
above
average
cost
for
others.
so
the
federal
government
is,
in
effect,
relying
upon
the
state
commissions
to
provide
the
difference
where
it's
not
allowing
fully
distributed
costs,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
not
it
not
be
confiscatory
to
allow
only
marginal
costs
where
you
yourself
are
not
assuring
the
obtaining
of
more
than
average
costs
somewhere
else?
justice
antonin
scalia
you're
sure
that's
not
here,
though?
you're
sure
that
question
is
not
here
in
this
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
excuse
me,
what
about
a
failure...
a
failure
to
renew,
because
of
the
fact
that
the
company
is
just
not
satisfied
with
the
amount
that
it's
getting?
would
the
fcc
stop
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know,
maybe
because
they
say,
you
know,
we're
rate
regulated
anyway.
it's
not
as
though...
it's
not
as
though
it's
going
to
be
money
in
our
pockets.
to
the
extent
we
get
it
from
the
cable
people,
we
get
a
little
less
from
our
electric
and
telephone
subscribers.
the
state
will
make
up
the
difference,
and
actually,
we
may
do
better,
because
there's
less
regulatory
lag
there.
justice
antonin
scalia
suppose
they
do
that
and
the
state
lets
them
get
away
with
it?
would
the
fcc
stop
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
munn
v.
illinois,
could
the
railroads
have
simply
said,
we're
going
to
get...
or
the
grain
storage
warehousemen
simply
said,
we're
going
to
get
out
of
this
business?
we
don't
think
that
the
rate
that
the
state
has
provided
is
enough.
we're
out.
justice
antonin
scalia
perhaps
not
finally.
but
can't
it
come
up
with
a
figure?
and
if
that
figure
turns
out
in
the
judgment
of
article
iii
courts
to
be
compensatory,
it's
all
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
topol,
a
lot
of
utilities
can't
do
that.
the
problem
i
have
is
whether
this
should
be
analogized
to...
to
a
typical
taking
case,
or
rather,
to
a
utility
regulation
case;
to
hope
natural
gas,
for
which
purpose
it's
absolutely
clear,
it
seems
to
me,
that
there
has
been
no
taking
or...
and
i'm
not
sure
which
way
you
want
to
put
it...
the
taking
has
been
adequately
compensated,
so
long
as
a
utility
is
allowed
to
get
fully
distributed
costs.
you
wouldn't
dispute
that
point,
would
you,
that
for
purposes
of
hope
natural
gas,
fully
distributed
cost
is
fine?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
a
landlord
is,
for
all
of
that,
not
a
public
utility.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
we've
said
something
different
in
utility
cases,
for
some
reason.
i
mean,
you
know,
don't
ask
me
why;
but
we
have.
we've
said
that
so
long
as
you...
you
don't
have
to
assure
the
most
the
market
will
bear.
where
you
have
a
utility
that's
been
given
a
monopoly,
it's
enough
if
you
assure
them,
in
essence,
fully
distributed
cost,
enough
to
make
a
go
of
the
business.
and
these
utilities
have
these
poles
only
because
they
are
a
utility.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose,
then,
that
the
states
would
be
acting
unconstitutionally
if
they
only
allowed
the
utilities
to
get
fully
distributed
for
the
stringing
of...
for
allowing
telephone
companies
to
string
their
wires
on
their
poles?
that's
just
as
much
of
a
physical
taking.
do
you
mean
that
the
states
have
to
allow
the
electric
utilities
to
hold
up
the
telephone
companies
for
whatever
the
market
will
bear
in
order
to
string
the
telephone
wires?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
it's
not
a
loretto
taking,
though,
if
it's
a
hope
natural
gas
taking,
if
it's
that
kind
of
a
taking,
in
that
area,
it's
always
the
legislature
or
a
state
agency
that
makes
the
determination
of
what's
just
compensation,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
which
a
court
simply
reviews?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
there's
clearly
nothing
inherent
in
takings
that
requires
the
court
to
have
the
first
cut
at
it.
it's
only
one
class
of
takings.
i
mean,
there's
a
whole
broad
class
of
takings
in
utility
regulation
that...
where
that
isn't
the
case.
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
the
agency's
standard.
the
agency's
standard
is
usually
fully
distributed
cost
on
the
totality
of
your
business.
