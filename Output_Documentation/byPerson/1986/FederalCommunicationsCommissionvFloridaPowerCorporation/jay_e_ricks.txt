mr.
jay
e.
ricks
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i'm
appearing
on
behalf
of
the
cable
company
and
cable
association
parties
that
participated
in
the
proceeding
below.
in
regard
to
the
questions
that
were
propounded
to
mr.
wallace,
let
me
just
add
that
only
the
state
of
california
requires
access
to
utility
poles
for
purposes
of
cable
television.
no
other
state
has
such
a
statute,
although
a
number
of
states
do
regulate
this
activity.
and
when
they
regulate
this
activity,
under
the
federal
statute,
there
is
an
automatic
preemption
by
the
states.
there
is
no
federal
requirement
of
access.
in
this
case,
there
was
no
local
compulsion
of
access.
the
utility
voluntarily
licensed...
in
fact,
has
licensed
cable
systems
for
over
20
years,
to
use
excess
space
on
its
poles.
i
would
to
just
make
this
observation,
that
the
very
purpose
of
the
pole
attachment
act
was
to
prevent
utilities
such
as
florida
power
from
charging
a
rate
for
the
cable
attachment
that
was
based
on
the
scarcity
value
or
the
hold-up
value
of
the
pole.
as
mr.
wallace
noted,
congress
found
that
utilities
controlled
a
critical
gateway
to
the
provision
of
an
important
interstate
communication
service;
that
the
utilities
were
seeking
to
exact
a
monopoly
profit
for
the
use
of
the
gateway;
and
that
the
regulation
of
the
gateway
was
required
in
the
public
interest.
the
statute,
we
believe,
is
thus
similar
to
the
regulation
of
a
grain
elevator
in
munn
v.
illinois,
or
other
efforts
by
government
or
states
to
regulate
an
essential...
the
use
of
an
essential
gateway
in
the
public
interest.
the
eleventh
circuit,
we
believe,
pushed
the
loretto
analogy
far
beyond
the
facts
of
this
case.
in
loretto,
as
distinguished
from
this
case,
the
new
york
statute
mandated
that
the
cable
come
on
the
premises
of
an
unwilling
property
owner.
here,
the
fcc...
neither
the
fcc
nor
the
statute
vests
in
th
cable
company
any
right
to
have
access
to
utility
property.
in
its
takings
analysis
in
the
loretto
case,
this
court
noted
a
number
of
characteristics
of
the
ownership
of
property
that,
when
disturbed
by
a
government-regulated
occupation,
will...
will
rise
to
a
taking
of
that
property.
the
court
noted
that
the
property
is
taken,
or
that
a
third
party
takes
possession
of
the
property,
against
the
wishes
of
the
owner.
the
court
noted
that
the
owner
cannot
repossess
the
property
that
has
been
occupied;
and
that
the
owner
cannot
control
the
use
of
the
possession
of
the
property
after
it's
been
occupied.
here,
for
over
20
years,
as
i
noted,
florida
power
has
voluntarily
licensed
its
poles.
the
contract
that
it
employs
for
that
purpose
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
that
orders
the
relationship
between
the
parties.
and
the
contract
provides
that
at
any
time
florida
power
wishes,
it
can
deny
space
to
a
cable
operator
if
it
has
a
need
for
the
space;
it
can
repossess
any
space
that
it
requires
for
its
own
needs;
and
it
can
continue
to
control
the
pole,
irrespective
of
the
occupation.
the
eleventh
circuit
engaged
in
a
great
deal
of
speculation
about
the
permanency
of
the
occupation,
but
it
had
only
to
look
to
the
contract
between
the
parties
to
see
that
the
use
was
conditional
upon
the
utility
getting
the
pole
back
at
any
time
that
it
needed
it.
mr.
jay
e.
ricks
mr.
chief
justice,
the
contract
has
a
term
in
it
for,
i
believe,
five
years,
and
then
renewable,
six
months
or
year
increments
after
that;
at
which
time,
presumably,
it
could,
if
it
wished
to,
go
out
of
that
business.
the
congress
observed,
in
not
creating
a
right
of
access,
that
it
didn't
think
that
would
ever
be
a
problem,
because
under
the
statutory
provision
of
compensation,
the
utility
was
getting
a
positive
benefit
for
an
otherwise
unproductive
use
of
its
property;
and
therefore,
it
would
strain
credulity
to
say,
why
would
a
utility
not
wish
to
lower
the
revenue
requirement
for
its
public
subscribers
and
go
out
of
the
use
of--
mr.
jay
e.
ricks
--well,
that
seemed
to
be
the
observation.
in
connection
with
questions
that
were
asked
of
mr.
wallace,
yes,
i
believe
the
fcc
would
prevent
a
retaliatory
eviction.
but
the
fcc
has
never
been
faced
with
a
prospect
of
a
utility
that
for
good
and
sufficient
reasons
says,
i
don't
want
you
to
use
poles.
now,
interestingly,
this
contract--
mr.
jay
e.
ricks
--the...
justice
scalia,
the
utility
has
the
right
to
obtain
fully
allocated
costs.
and
fully
allocated
costs,
as
we
know
in
the
utility
lexicon,
include
a
return
on
capital.
here
the
utility
asked
for
and
received
14.6
return
on
its
capital
stock.
now,
why
would
a
utility
say,
i
don't
want
to
get
14.6
return
on
my
capital
stock?
mr.
jay
e.
ricks
well,
that
is
absolutely
correct
that
the
utility
is
not
going
to
be
enriched
by
exacting
more
money
from
the
cable
operator,
but
it's
merely
a--
mr.
jay
e.
ricks
--the
fcc
is
not
presented
with
that
case.
and
under
the
act,
it
would
have,
in
my
judgment,
questionable
jurisdiction
to
stop
that.
that's
a...
perhaps
it's
a
hole
in
the
act,
a
loophole
in
the
act,
but
it's
one
that
commonsense
said
you
don't
need,
because
it's
inconceivable
that
the
state
would
allow
a
utility
to
forego
a
positive
contribution
to
its
revenue.
mr.
jay
e.
ricks
this
court
has
dealt
with
that
in
rent
control
cases,
and
has
said
that
a
property
owner
can
not
get
out
of
the
ambit
of
regulation
simply
by
saying,
i'm
going
to
cease
renting
my
property.
that
was
the
situation
mr.
wallace
referred
to
in
the
clearwater
shopping
center
case.
the
entity
was
not
allowed
by
the
statute
to
get
out
of
rent
regulation
by
wanted
to
go
out
of
the
business.
in
fact,
that's
exactly
what
they
wanted
to
do
there.
and
the
state
said,
no,
you
may
not
get
out
of
that
business.
you
have
to
stay
in
it.
now,
i
would
like
to
just
mention
that
in
the
contract
that
florida
power
has
employed
for
the
relationship
with
cable
systems,
which
is,
as
i
said,
in
the
joint
appendix,
it
has
precluded
an
entire
class
of
poles
that
cannot
be
used
by
cable.
and
they
are
concrete
poles.
florida
power,
i
assume
because
of
the
environment
in
the
state
of
florida,
has
elected
to
use
some
poles
that
are
made
out
of
concrete.
and
i
believe...
because
i'm
not
sure...
but
i
believe
because
they
do
not
have
those
poles
weakened
by
having
a
hole
drilled
through
them,
for...
historically,
they
have
refused
to
allow
cable
systems
to
use
them.
and
there
has
never
been
a
case
that
i'm
aware
of,
at
least,
in
which
a
cable
operator
successfully
has
argued
that
i
should
have
access
to
those
poles
because
they're
there.
they
made
a
rational
decision
to
exclude
cable,
and
the
fcc
and
states
have
not
interfered
with
that
decision.
turning
to
the
issue
of
compensation,
we
agree
with
mr.
wallace
that
there's
no
taking
here
under
the
decisions
of
this
court.
but
we
also
believe
that
even
if
you
accept
a
taking
under
the
loretto
model,
this
statute
provides
for
just
compensation.
interestingly,
florida
power
did
not
claim
that
this
statute
was
unconstitutional
before
the
eleventh
circuit,
but
that
the
order
of
the
fcc
constituted
a
taking
of
its
property
without
just
compensation,
because,
florida
power
argued,
the
fcc
set
the
compensation
on
the
basis
of
fully
allocated
cost,
rather
than
on
the
value
to
the
cable
system,
which
is
what
florida
power
wanted.
the
eleventh
circuit,
on
a
point
that
was
not
briefed
by
any
party,
held
that
the
statute
was
facially
unconstitutional
because
it
prevented
the
fcc
from
determining
just
compensation.
but
in
alabama
power
v.
fcc,
in
a
case
before
the
d.c.
circuit,
the
panel
that
included
justice...
then
judge
scalia...
the
d.c.
circuit
held
that
the
fcc
is
not
bound...
is
not
bound
to
set
compensation
at
any
particular
level
by
the
pole
attachment
act;
but
indeed,
that
the
fcc
is
obligated
to
set
the
element
of...
the
rate
of
return
at
whatever
level
would
be
required
to
avoid
a
confiscation
of
the
utility's
property.
we
believe,
your
honor...
honors,
that
the
statute
is
constitutional.
