mr.
joseph
locascio
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
on
february
the
5th,
1982,
police
officer
stewart
of
the
kansas
city,
missouri,
police
department
went
over
to
respondent's
house
to
take
her
into
custody
for
a
pick-up
on
homicide.
the
state
has
conceded
there
was
no
probable
cause
for
that
arrest.
coincidentally,
when
he
got
to
her
home,
he
ran
her
address
through
the
police
department
computer,
and
was
told
by
that
computer
that
a
parking
warrant
existed
authorizing
that
she
be
taken
into
custody
on
a
park...
a
failure
to
pay
a
parking
fine.
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
the
missouri
supreme
court
found
that
there
was
no
arrest
on
a
parking
ticket.
mr.
joseph
locascio
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
locascio
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
locascio
yes,
your
honor.
as
justice
white
pointed
out
earlier,
the
supreme
court
of
missouri's
opinion
said
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
the
evidence
on
whether
she
was
arrested
on
the
parking
warrant.
the
trial
court
resolved
those
conflicts
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
implicit--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--i
think
at
the
point
in
the
supreme
court
of
missouri's
opinion,
when
they're
talking
about
the
evidence,
they're
not
talking
about
pretext.
they're
talking
about
whether
or
not
this
woman
was
legitimately
arrested
on
a
parking
ticket.
now,
they
then
say--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--well,
whether
she
was
arrested.
mr.
joseph
locascio
the
first--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--i
explain
that
by
the
fact
that
they
reach...
they
give
an
opinion
about
the
pretextual
nature
of
this
arrest
only
secondary
to
the
fact
that
this
was
an
illegal
arrest
from
the
beginning,
and
there
was
no
arrest
on
a
parking
ticket.
so
actually,
the
finding
that
this
arrest
was
pretextual
is
not
even
necessary.
and
my
argument
to
this
court
is
that
it
doesn't
even
have
to
reach
the
pretext
argument,
or
the
pretext
issue,
precisely
because
there
was
no
arrest
on
a
parking
ticket.
mr.
joseph
locascio
of
missouri?
mr.
joseph
locascio
there
opinion
states--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--yes,
your
honor,
a5
and
6
of
the
joint...
of
the
petition
for
certiorari
specifically
states
that...
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
starts
out
saying
that
there
was
a
conflict
in
evidence--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--at
that
point,
they
analyzed
the
evidence.
and
the
next
paragraph
is
that
the
conflicts
raised
by
the
evidence
were
for
the
trial
court
to
resolve.
the
trial
court
resolved
them
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
now,
the
defendant
at
the
trial
court
level
had
two
arguments.
number
one,
this
was
an
illegal
arrest
for
homicide,
and
that
this
parking
ticket
did
not
even
come
into
play.
supplemental
legal
file
37,
addendum
to
supplemental
legal
file
32,
we
argue
specifically
that
at
least
at
the
point
where
she
was
brought
to
the
homicide
unit
and
booked
for
homicide
and
not
booked
on
a
parking
warrant,
that
detention
was
the
product...
was
for
the
sole
reason
of
investigating
a
homicide
and
not
for
a
parking
warrant.
and
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
found
that
any...
that
any
arrest,
if
you
want
to
assume
that
an
arrest
occurred
for
a
parking
ticket,
was
not
pursued.
and
that
is...
and
the
reason
they
say
that
is
precisely
because
it
was
not
pursued.
she
was
not
booked
on
the
parking
ticket.
so
the
detention
was
solely
for
homicide.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
i
think
you're
not...
i
think,
your
honor,
you
have
to
look
at
what
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
said
at
the
bottom
of
page
a5,
when
they
say,
specifically,
the
evidence
conflicts
on
this
issue,
the
evidence
conflicts
of
whether
the
officers
arrested
the
defendant
on
the
outstanding
parking
violation
warrant.
the
beginning
of
the
next
paragraph,
the
conflict
was
raised...
the
conflicts
thus
raised
by
the
evidence
were
for
the
trial
court
to
resolve,
and
they
resolved
them
in
favor
of
defendant.
so
this
court
does
not
even
have
to
reach
any
issue
about
whether
this
was
a
pretextual
arrest.
this
was
an
arrest
for
a
homicide
without
probable
cause
in
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i
think
that
the
evidence
was
abundantly
clear
that
there
was
no
arrest
on
a
parking
warrant.
mr.
joseph
locascio
yes.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
i'm
saying
that
if
you
look
at
the
exhibits
that
were
filed,
exhibit
3,
the
arrest
report,
doesn't
say
that
the
arrest
was
for
a
parking
ticket.
if
you
go
back
and
look
at
exhibit
10,
which
is
the
exhibit
that
talks
about
her
being
booked
the
next
day
on
the
parking
warrant,
that
exhibit
specifically
says
that
she
was
arrested
at
that
time
on
the
parking
warrant.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i
think
that
the
only
way
to
decide
that
is
to
look
at
the
objective
facts
to
determine--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--well,
i
certainly
think
he
must
have
to
know,
not
only--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--i
think
under
those
facts
as
you've
given
me,
yes,
it's
unlawful,
precisely
because
the
actions
he
took
were
not
justified
by
the
fourth
amendment.
but
what
i'm
saying
is
that
the
court
doesn't
have
to
reach
into
the
subjective
mind
of
the
police
officer
in
this
case.
because
the
subjective
mind
of
the
police
officer
doesn't
come
into
play
if
the
arrest
warrant...
the
parking
warrant
didn't
come
into
play.
and
we're
saying
the
missouri
courts
found
it
did
not
come
into
play.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i'm
saying
that
this
court
doesn't
have
to
get
into
an
analysis
to
decide--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--well,
that
is
our...
that's
a
matter
of
perspective,
i
think.
there
was
no
reason
in
this
police--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--well,
there
is
law
that
says
that
they
have
a
right
to
fingerprint
to
identify
an
individual.
but
there
is
also
the
clear
evidence
in
this
case
that
when
they
arrest
somebody
on
a
parking
ticket,
the
way
they
identify
them
is
to
take
an
index
fingerprint.
mr.
joseph
locascio
that's
true.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
presumably,
when
they
wrote
their
local
practice,
they
determined
what
their
needs
were.
and
they
determined
on
parking
warrants
their
need
is
to
identify
someone
by
way
of
an
index
fingerprint.
and
so
to
go
beyond
that
would
seem
to
be--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--because...
they
didn't...
because
that's
not
the
purpose
for
which
they
acted.
what
i'm
trying
to
say
is
that--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--i
don't
think
in
this
case
there
was
anything
inevitable
about
this
palm
print.
if
they
would
have--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--no.
not
if
they're--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--well,
in
that
situation
that
you
have
given
me,
then
this
court
would
be
talking
about
reaching
my
second
point,
which
is
that
it's
unlawful
and
a
violation
of
the
constitution
to
use
the
power
that
you
have
primarily
for
ulterior
purposes.
mr.
joseph
locascio
when
i
say,
primary
purpose,
that
doesn't
necessarily
mean
subjective
purpose.
because
if
you
read
scott,
the
way
scott
talks
about
purpose
is
on
the
objective
facts.
and
what
we
submit
here
is
that
even
on
the
objective
facts,
they
would
not
have
gotten
a
palm
print.
and
in
your
example
on
the
objective
facts,
they
didn't
do
anything
that
would
normally
do,
if
i
understand
correctly.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
it
wouldn't
be
all
right
if
she's
booked
for
murder
because
of
a
traffic
warrant?
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
it's
precisely
because
this
woman
is
subjected
to
the
most
humiliating
and
frightening
and
intrusive
experience
that
a
person
could
be
without
probable
cause.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
she
certainly
has
a
permanent
record
for
homicide.
mr.
joseph
locascio
precisely
because
they
obtained
the
palm
print
as
the
fruit
of
an
unlawful
detention.
mr.
joseph
locascio
but
that's
not
what
happened
here.
mr.
joseph
locascio
right.
we're
back
to
the
question
of
whether
or
not
she
was
lawfully
detained
on
a
parking
warrant.
and
we're
submitting
under
these
facts
that
she
was
not.
mr.
joseph
locascio
whether
or
not--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--right.
that
is
the
analysis.
and
what
we
submit
is
that
you
don't...
the
court
need
not
even
reach
the
second
level
of
whether
she
was
lawfully
detained,
because
the
objective
facts
alone
in
this
case
demonstrate
beyond
dispute,
i
claim,
that
the
sole
reason
for
the
detention
was
homicide,
and
not
for
parking
warrant
at
all.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i
think
the
only
objection
i
would
have
at
that
point
would
be
that
the
procedure
was
arbitrary.
unless
there
was
some
legitimate
reason
to
only
palm-print
the
tenth
individual.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i
think
that
anything
that's
arbitrary,
and
is
not
obtained
by
probable
cause,
that
it
violates
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
locascio
no,
no,
you
have
to
have...
whose
lawfully
detained?
mr.
joseph
locascio
no,
of
course
not.
of
course
not.
the
cases
especially
out
of
this
district
of
columbia
say
that
you
can
fingerprint
for
purposes
of
identifications.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i
think
you
arguable
have
a
constitutional
question
of
the
need
to
palm-print,
because--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--because
that's
not
what
was
meant
when
you
fingerprint
an
individual
for
purposes
of
identification.
under
that
example
that
you've
given
me,
then
there
would
be
no
reason
why
you
can't
feet
print
or
hair
or
teeth
impressions.
mr.
joseph
locascio
what
i
am
suggesting
is
that
what
happened
in
this
case
is
exactly--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--what's
wrong
with
it
in
this
case?
mr.
joseph
locascio
there
is
just
the...
in
that
example,
the
only
argument
that
you
would
have
is
that
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
take
a
palm
print.
there
was
no
demonstrated
need
to
talk
a
palm
print.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
not
if
it's
constitutional
to
fingerprint
for
purposes
of
identification.
but
under
that
example,
if
you
want
to
palm-print...
or
if
you
want
to
print
someone
for
purposes
of
identification,
i
would
think
that
the
most
appropriate
print
to
take
would
be
the
footprint,
because
that's
the
one
that's
on
the
birth
certificate.
so
you
can't
identify
someone
based
on
a
print
unless
you
something
to
compare
them
to.
so
if
you
take
a
palm
print--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--you
know,
the
question
that
you
ask
really
gets...
no,
that's
not
where
we're
at
now.
what
we
are
submitting
is
that
she
was
subjected
to
a
very
humiliating
experience
for
arrest
and
booking
for
homicide
when
no
probable
cause
existed.
she
was
not
subjected
to
the
simple
procedures
that
were
authorized
in
connection
with
a
parking
warrant
violation.
our
primary
submission
then
is
that,
notwithstanding
any
subjective
intent
at
all
in
this
case--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--i
think
under
your
example
that
you
do
have
to
look
at
the
purpose.
but
the
question
doesn't
necessarily
mean
that
you
would
have
to
look
at
the
subjective
intent.
you
could
just
look
at
what
the
objective
factors
tell
you
to
have
been
the
purpose
of
the...
in
your
example,
of
the
boarding
of
the
ship.
now,
under
your
example,
also,
i
might
point
out
that
the
right
of
the
coast
guard
to
board
those
ships
has
been
occurring
all
the
time
precisely
for
searching
for
drugs.
and
that's--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--of
course
not,
you
don't
have
to
throw
that
out.
because
human
beings
act
for
dual
motives
all
the
time.
there's
always
a
mixed
motive
for
doing
something.
what
i'm
asking
the
court
to
recognize
is
that
they
comply
with
the
fourth
amendment
according
to
their
primary
motive.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i
think
just
looking...
not
even
getting
into
subjective
intent
now
on
this
second
point,
the
objective
facts
alone
tell
us
that
their
primary
motive
was
to
investigate
homicide.
she
was
arrested
for
that
offense,
and
the
objective
facts
tell
us...
she
was
booked
for
that
offense,
and
she
was
not
booked,
nor
was
the
parking
warrant
pursued.
so
you
don't...
in
this
case,
the
court
does
not
have
to
get
into
delving...
as
justice
white
pointed
out
in
his
dissent
in
massachusetts
v.
paton,
where
the
writ
of
certiorari
was
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted,
if
you
go
into
the
subjective
minds
of
the
police,
you're
really
getting
into
an
area
that
may
be
a
waste
of
judicial
time.
because
it's
very
difficult
to
determine
what
subjectively
is
going
on
in
the
mind
of
the
police.
however,
in
this
case,
you
don't
even
have
to
do
that.
because
if
you
just
consider
the
objective
facts
involved,
the
objective
facts
will
tell
you...
well
tell
anybody
who
knows
this
case
that
the
primary
purpose
of
picking
her
up,
of
arresting
her
and
detaining
her,
was
solely...
was
for
homicide.
we
contend
also...
we
contend
more
than
that,
that
it
was
solely
for
homicide.
but
we
think,
borrowing
from
this
court's
opinion
in
michigan
v.
clifford
that
a
good
test
would
be
primary
purpose.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
if...
i
assume
then...
under
your
example,
i
will
assume
that
they
did
not
know
about
the
arrest
warrant
at
the
time
they
conducted
the
arrest.
mr.
joseph
locascio
under
your
example,
your
honor,
then
the--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--under
the
example,
would
be
that
oftentimes
when
police
officers
do
perform
illegal
arrests,
there's
probable
cause
out
there
somewhere,
that
if
they'd
only
investigate
the
case,
they'd
find
it.
but
that's
not
the
purpose
for
which
they
acted.
mr.
joseph
locascio
that's
true.
and
under
those
situations,
there's
really
no
way
to
deter
the
unlawful
conduct
of
the
police
in
that
example.
but
in
this
case,
there
is
a
clear
way
to
deter
the
unlawful
conduct
of
the
police
in
this
case.
they
went
over
there
to
conduct
an
illegal
arrest.
the
evidence
was
clear:
he
went
over
there
to
arrest
her
for
homicide.
it
was
just
coincidental
to
that
fact
that
his
computer
had
a
parking
warrant
in
it.
so
he
takes
her
to
the
homicide
unit,
and
all
the
objective
facts
would
indicate
that
they
did
not...
were
not
in
any
way
interested
in
the
parking
warrant.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
that's
what
happened
in
hayes
v.
florida
in
1985.
mr.
joseph
locascio
that's
exactly
what
this
court
held
to
be
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
because
there
was
no
probable
cause
to
do
that,
to
take
the
person
to
the
police
station,
detain
them,
and
take
a
palm
print.
palm
prints
are
certainly
covered
by
the
fourth
amendment.
and
before
you
can
do
that,
you
need
at
least
probable
cause--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--sure,
they
took
some
statements.
but
first
what
they
did
was
they--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--of
course,
but
they
brought
him
down
to
the
police
station
without
probable
cause.
and
that
was...
the
statements
were
the
direct
fruit
of
an
illegal
arrest,
which
is
what
happened
here.
the
palm
print
was
the
direct
fruit--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--well,
under
that
example,
there's
certainly
no
prohibition
to
arrest
the
fellow.
mr.
joseph
locascio
well,
see,
but
that's
not
the
facts
of
our
case.
because
the
facts
of
our
case,
even
if
you...
even
if
you
consider
that
an
arrest
was
made
on
a
parking
warrant,
their
standard
procedures
would
not
have
given
them
an
index
fingerprint.
they
had
no
desire
to
obtain
a
palm
print
but...
except
for
their
interest
in
investigating
a
homicide.
mr.
joseph
locascio
in
this
case?
mr.
joseph
locascio
not
really.
because
it
was
more
than
that.
it
was
more
than
that.
they
not
only
did
it
for
the
wrong
reason.
they
subjected
her
to
a
procedure,
a
very
intimidating
and
frightening
procedure
for
being
under
arrest
for
homicide.
they
bring
her
down
to
the
police
headquarter
homicide
unit
where
the
commander
says,
book
her
for
homicide.
they
bring
her
to
the
city
jail,
they
book
her
for
homicide.
so
this...
a
lot
more
happened
to
this
women.
mr.
joseph
locascio
what
we
claim
is
that
the
palm
print
was
the
fruit
of
that
illegal
action.
that...
that
objective
conduct,
in
this
case,
was
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
and
as
the
direct
fruit
of
that
booking,
detention
for
murder,
they
obtained
a
palm
print.
mr.
joseph
locascio
of
course
not.
no.
if
i--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
locascio
no,
your
honor,
they
would
not
have.
mr.
joseph
locascio
they
would
have
taken
her
to
her
local
precinct,
which
is
just
a
few
blocks
from
where
she
lives.
mr.
joseph
locascio
the
would
have
filled
out
the
form
that
they
eventually
filled
out
in
this
case.
mr.
joseph
locascio
taken
an
index
fingerprint,
and
allowed
her
to
sit
there
until
her
relatives
posted
bond.
mr.
joseph
locascio
and
they
booked
her
for
murder.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i'm
saying--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
joseph
locascio
i
agree.
there's
no
question
about
that.
but
what
we're
talking
about
it--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--yes,
your
honor.
but
what
we're
saying
is
that
she
was
subjected
to
more
than
just
being
brought
down
to
the
police
headquarters.
in
fact,
she
was
brought
directly
to
the
commander
of
the
homicide
unit.
and
what
we're
saying
is
that
when
you
try
to
justify
that
on
the
basis
that
she
failed
to
pay
a
parking
ticket,
and
therefore
a
municipal
judge
issued
a
bench
warrant,
that
that
is
unreasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
locascio
that
when
your
justification
is
to
subject
a
person
to
these
type
of
procedures--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--what
i
meant
to
say
was,
when
you
subject
a
woman
to
what
she
was
subjected
to,
and
then
you
say,
my
justification
was,
there
was
a
bench
warrant,
when
they
certainly
don't
follow
these
procedures
when
a
bench...
when
they
really
are
executing
a
bench
warrant,
that
that
is
a
violation
of
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
joseph
locascio
there
is
nothing
wrong
with
executing
a
bench
warrant.
mr.
joseph
locascio
and
the
police
in
this
case
should
very
well
have
gone
out
and
executed
in
this
case.
but
what
they--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--what
they
should
have
done--
mr.
joseph
locascio
--well,
i'm...
thank
you.
