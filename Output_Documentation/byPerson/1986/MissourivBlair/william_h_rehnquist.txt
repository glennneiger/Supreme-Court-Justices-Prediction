chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
afternoon
in
no.
85-303,
missouri
against
blair.
mr.
riederer,
you
may
proceed
when
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
riederer,
a
parking
warrant
issued
in
this
case,
is
that
a
situation
where
a
person
gets
a
parking
ticket
and
fails
to
pay
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
city
limits
being
kansas
city?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
riederer.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
locascio.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
could
you
turn
to
a
page?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
where
are
you?
bottom
of
a5.
the
evidence
conflicts
on
whether
the
officers
arrested
the
defendant
on
the
outstanding
parking
violation
warrant
blah-blah,
and
then
they
say...
they
show
what
the
conflict
was,
okay?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
loscascio?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
do
you
mean
when
you
say
there
was
no
arrest,
quote,
on,
close
quote,
a
parking
warrant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
how
do
you
decide
whether
a
person
was
arrested
on,
close
quote,
a
particular
warrant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
the
legal
test?
does
the
officer
have
to
know
that
the
warrant
exists?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
suppose
there's
an
outstanding
warrant
against
someone
for
robbery.
and
the
officer
goes
out
to
arrest,
not
knowing
the
warrant
exists,
but
thinking
perhaps
he
has
probable
cause
without
a
warrant.
now,
is
that
invalid
if
there
is
no
probable...
if
the
officer's
idea
of
probable
cause
was
wrong,
even
though
there
was
an
outstanding
warrant?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what's
wrong
with
that?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
what
follows
as
a
result
of
her
having
been
booked?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
all
we're
talking
about
is
whether
the
palm
print
should
be
suppressed.
the
missouri
supreme
court
didn't
pass
on
all
the
rest
of
the
stuff.
we're
not
interested
in
a
minute
examination
of
whether
some
of
this
conduct
after
the
palm
print
was
wrong.
the
question
is,
what
was
bad
about
the
police
action
with
respect
to
the
palm
print
that
requires
it
being
suppressed
when
it's
an
indication
of...
evidence
in
the
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
it's
conceded
that
she
could
have
been
detained
for
the
traffic
violation...
traffic
warrant,
couldn't
she?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
we're
back
to
what
did
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
mean
and
that
sort
of
thing.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
of
course,
to
say,
whether
she
was
lawfully
detained
on
a
parking
warrant
begs
the
factual
question.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
locascio,
what
if
the
kansas
city
police
department,
of
the
jackson
county
police,
had
had
a
policy
if
palm-printing
every
tenth
person
who
was
brought
in
a
traffic
warrant,
and
just
fingerprinting
the
other
nine.
and
your
client
happened
to
be
the
tenth
person
who
was
brought
in.
would
you
think
that...
and
there
was
no
question
that
he
was
brought
in
on
an
arrest
pursuant
to
a
traffic
warrant...
do
you
think
you
could
object
if
that
later
proved
useful
in
a
murder
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you
think
anything
that
strikes
you
as
arbitrary
is
excludable
from
a
criminal
trial?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
do
you
think
that
you
have
to
have
probable
cause
to
take
a
fingerprint
of
someone
who
is
lawfully
detained?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
assume
the
person
is
lawfully
detained,
do
you
think
you
have
to
have
further
probable
cause
to
take
a
fingerprint?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
i
take
it
if
you
were
to
palm-print
everyone
who
was
brought
in
on
a
traffic
warrant,
that
would
be
all
right,
in
your
view?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
if
there's
no
requirement
for
a
need
to
fingerprint,
why
should
there
be
a
constitutional
requirement
for
a
need
to
palm-print?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
it
that
is
constitutionally
different
between
taking
a
fingerprint
and
taking
a
palm
print?
obviously,
you
think
there
is,
because
your
answer
to
my
question
suggests
that.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
want
a...
i'd
like
an
answer
to
my
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
no,
i'm
not
asking,
what's
wrong
with
it
in
this
case.
what
i
ask
you,
and
what
i
would
like
you
to
answer,
is,
what
is
it
that's
constitutionally
different
between
taking
a
fingerprint
and
taking
a
a
palm
print?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
don't
need
a
demonstrated
need
or
probable
cause
to
take
a
fingerprint?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
locascio.
mr.
riederer,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
riederer.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
have
the
judgments
of
the
court
to
announce
in
two
cases
no.
85-303,
missouri
against
blair,
no.
85-1656
lynaugh
against
petty.
in
each
of
these
cases
the
writ
of
certiorari
is
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
