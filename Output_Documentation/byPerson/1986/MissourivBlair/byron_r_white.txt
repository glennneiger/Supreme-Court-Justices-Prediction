justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
station
house
on
the
parking
warrant
charge,
would
her
palm
print
have
been
taken
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
there's
no
claim
in
this
case,
is
there,
that
it
would
have
been
unconstitutional
to
take
the
palm
print
just
on
a
parking
warrant
arrest?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
trial
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
the
trial
court
find
the
arrest
was
for
homicide?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
immediately
put
on
the
street?
justice
byron
r.
white
immediately?
justice
byron
r.
white
just
like
eventually
happened
here.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
wasn't
she,
when
she
was
first
brought
in,
and
just
before
her
palm
print
was
taken,
she
was
booked
for
homicide?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
was
she
booked
for
homicide
if
she
was
arrested
on
the
parking
warrant?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
does
it
mean,
booked
for
homicide?
does
that
mean
that
she's
charged
with
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
pretty
clearly...
what
does
it
indicate
to
you,
when
the
officers
book
her
for
homicide?
what
did
they
arrest
her
for,
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
you...
i
guess
you
say,
as
justice
o'connor
was
inquiring
from
you,
if
she's
booked...
just
arrested
on
the
parking
warrant,
brought
in
and
given
a...
and
one
fingerprint
is
taken.
and
then
it
would
be
perfectly
all
right
with
you
if
she
was
then
detained
while
some
officers
from
the
homicide
department
who
had
no
probable
cause
to
believe
that
she
was
guilty
of
murder,
but
some
suspicion,
could
come
in
and
question
her?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
have
to
go
that
far
at
least,
don't
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
some
officers
who
really
had
only
a
vague
suspicion
could
then
question
her
before
she
was
released?
justice
byron
r.
white
may
i
ask,
is
that...
well,
the
detention
unit
holds
her
for
that.
but
why
was
she
booked
for
homicide?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
didn't
do
it
out
of
the
air.
he
did
it
because
somebody
told
him.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
should
we
differ
with
the
decisions
of
the...
as
i
read
what
was
written
below,
it
was
accepted
that
the
arrest
was
for
a
homicide.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
shouldn't
we
accept
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
how
about...
is
this
wrong?
this
is
in
the
supreme
court's
opinion,
i
think,
said:
officer
stewart's
partner,
officer
thomas,
filed
the
report
of
the
arrest
under
the
homicide
charge
number
as
investigation
arrest,
criminal
homicide.
and
the
officer
followed
the
procedures
for
arresting
and
booking
an
individual
for
homicide
rather
than
that
used
for
a
traffic
violation.
justice
byron
r.
white
now,
is
that
an
accurate
description
of
what
occurred
at
the
police
station?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
and
also,
the
supreme
court
seemed
to
me...
they
said
that
the...
on
the
conflicts
of
the
evidence,
one
of
which
was,
what
was
the
person
arrested
for,
the
trial
court
resolved
the
conflicts
in
favor
of
the
defendant.
that's
what
the
supreme
court
says.
and
the
court
defers
to
the
trial
court's
determination,
because
it
is
supported
by
the
evidence.
that's
what
it
said.
justice
byron
r.
white
it
had...
what
did...
in
order
to
sustain
the
suppression
motion,
it
had
to
find
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
if
it's
pretextual...
if
it's
pretextual,
it's
because
they
really
arrested
her
for
homicide.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only...
i
don't
know
what
difference
that
makes.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
claim
in
the
trial
court
was
that
this
palm
print
was
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
arrest
for
homicide.
justice
byron
r.
white
for
homicide?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
the
same
thing.
that's
the
same
thing.
and
the
state...
and
what
was
the
state's
response
to
the--
justice
byron
r.
white
--was
that
we
arrested
her
on
the
parking
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
don't
know
how
the
order...
the
suppression
order...
the
suppression
motion
could
have
been
sustained
and
the
evidence
suppressed
without
the
trial
court
concluding
that
this
was
not
a
valid
arrest
for
homicide?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
supreme
court
certainly
read
the
trial
court
as
having
resolved
the
conflict
this
way.
and
the
evidence
supported
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it
is
important
to
decide
whether
the
arrest
was
for
the
homicide
or
not?
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right.
and
so
you
get
the
officer
on
the
stand.
what
did
you
arrest
this
person
for?
i
arrested
him
for
homicide.
now,
is
that
inquiring
into
the
state
of
mind
of
the
officer?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
say
that's
not
the
way
to
proceed?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
you
do,
in
the
end,
have
to
decide,
as
the
chief
justice
says,
that
whether...
if
the...
if
the
officers
had
otherwise
a
perfectly
legal
reason
for
talking
her
palm
print,
the
palm
print
must
nevertheless
he
excluded,
because
the
reason
they
took
it
for
was
invalid.
now,
let's
assume
that
the
arrest
was
for
homicide.
everybody
agrees
for
homicide.
but
when
you
get
down...
and
they
take
her
palm
print.
but
then
it
turns
out
that
there
was
an
outstanding
warrant
for
a
robbery.
they
could
have
arrested
her
for
the
robbery.
they
could
have
taken
her
palm
print
for
robbery,
on
the
robbery
charge.
now,
you
say
that
because
the
actual
arrest
was
for
homicide,
the
palm
print
was
excludable.
you
at
least
have
to
handle
that
proposition.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
they
could...
it
wouldn't
have...
if
they
had
arrested
her
on
the
parking
violation,
it
would
not
have
been
unconstitutional
for
them
to
take
her
palm
print.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
it's
a
matter
of
law,
isn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
that's
the
local
practice.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
it's
not...
it
wouldn't
have
been
unconstitutional
if
their
practice
was
to
take
a
full
set
of
prints?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes,
but
all
that
goes
to
is
what
they
really
arrested
for
in
the
first
place.
but
conceding,
for
the
minute,
that
they
arrested
her
for
homicide,
if
they
had
some
other
completely
valid
reason
for
taking
her
palm
print,
why
exclude
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
--what
did
you
say...
what
was
your
reason,
i'm
not
sure
i
understood
it...
that,
suppose
it's
conceded
the
arrest
was
for
homicide,
but
that
the
police
had
a
perfectly
valid
outstanding
warrant
for
robbery,
under
which
the
person
could
have
been
arrested
and
held
and
a
palm
print
taken.
and
why
do
you
say
the
palm
print
then
should
be
excluded?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
they
never
found
it
out
until
they
got
to
the
stationhouse.
and
it's
conceded,
they
arrested
her
for
homicide
on
no
probable
cause.
but...
and
they
took
a
palm
print
pursuant
to
that
arrest.
but
they
could
have
gotten
the
palm
print
pursuant
to
that...
and
as
a
matter
of
fact,
they
could
have
rearrested
her
right
there
on
the
spot
for
robbery.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
taken
her
palm
print
right
then.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
don't...
you
know,
you
can
arrest
a
person
on
probable
cause.
and
if
there's
no...
no
fruit
of
the
illegal
arrest,
and
the
person
is
then
convicted,
that's
just
too
bad
about
the
probable
arrest.
there's
no
remedy
for
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
all
right,
they
bring
her
back
to
the
stationhouse
and
take
the
palm
print.
and
then
the
sergeant
says,
by
the
way,
we
want
to
book
this
person
for
robbery;
we
have
a
warrant.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
happened
in
hayes?
they
took
some
statements,
didn't
they?
justice
byron
r.
white
statements
that
they
might
not
have
gotten
if
they'd
have
made
a
valid
arrest.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
difference
here--
--you
wouldn't
say
if
they...
about
the
time
he
was
walking
out
the
door,
the
sergeant
said,
by
the...
don't
let
that
fellow
go.
we're
going
to
arrest
him
for
robbery
because
we
have
a
warrant
here.
the
took
him
back,
take
his
palm
print
again.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
if
the
sergeant
said,
well,
there's
no
use
taking
his
palm
print
again;
we've
already
got
one.
