mr.
riederer,
you
don't
contest,
do
you,
that
the
reason
that
the
full
print
was
taken
was
in
order
to
obtain...
in
order
to
investigate
the
murder?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
she
also
booked
for
violation...
failure
to
appear
on
the
traffic
summons?
justice
antonin
scalia
why
wasn't
she
booked
for
that
at
the
same
time?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
i
understand
that.
but
doesn't
that
go
to
the...
who
decides
what
she's
booked
for?
the
arresting
officer,
i
presume?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
doesn't
that
go--
justice
antonin
scalia
--well,
doesn't
that
go
to
the
point
that
you
were
responding
to
justice
o'connor
on
earlier?
you
earlier
said
that
this
is
not...
that
we
don't
really
have
to
decide
in
this
case
whether
mere
knowledge
of
the
warrant
would
be
enough.
you
say
they
knew
of
it
and
relied
on
it.
but
if
they
relied
on
that,
they
would
have
booked
her
on
that
when
they
brought
her
in.
why
should
we--
justice
antonin
scalia
--but
he
comes
back
and
doesn't
book
her
on
the
parking
violation.
justice
antonin

xxx.
as
i
read
their
opinion,
it
says,
assuming
an
arrest
for
the
parking
violation,
the
arrest
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
was
at
best
a
pretext
employed
to
gather
evidence
on
an
unrelated
homicide.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
there's
a
difference
between
saying
there
was
no
arrest
whatever
on
the
parking
ticket,
and
saying,
there
was
an
arrest
on
the
parking
ticket
but
the
police
were
really
doing
it
not
to
get
this
person
for
the
parking
ticket
but
to
get
her
on
the
homicide.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
it
seems
to
me
that
what
the
supreme
court
was
saying
was
the
latter.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
it
isn't
clear
on
which
basis.
on
the
basis
that
there
was
no
arrest
on
the
parking
ticket?
or
rather
on
the
basis
that
there
was
an
arrest
on
the
parking
ticket,
but
that
that
arrest
was
pretextual,
that
that
wasn't
the
real
reason
for
bringing
the
woman
in?
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
put
it
that
way,
whether
she
was
legitimately
arrested.
justice
antonin
scalia
she's
not
legitimately
arrested,
under
their
opinion,
if...
if...
although
she's
arrested
on
the
parking
ticket,
it
was
pretextual
for
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
how
do
you
explain
that
sentence
that
i
read?
assuming
an
arrest
for
the
parking
violation,
the
arrest
in
the
circumstances
of
this
case
was
at
best
a
pretext?
justice
antonin
scalia
where
do
you
find
that
in
the
language
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
is
it
clear
that
when
the
court
says,
the
conflicts
thus
raised
were
for
the
trial
court
to
resolve,
is
it
clear
that
they're
talking
only
there
about
the
conflict
as
to
whether
the
arrest
was
on
the
parking
ticket
or
not?
or
rather,
is
the
conflict
that
they're
talking
about
the
conflict
as
to
whether
it
was,
or
if
it
wasn't,
whether
it
was
pretextual?
it
seems
to
me
that
it
was
both,
because
if
you
read
further
on
in
that
paragraph,
it
discusses
other
missouri
cases
that
deal
with
pretext.
and
it
concludes
the
paragraph
by
saying:
such
pretextual
use
to
justify
an
arrest
or
search
has
been
clearly
recognized
as
violative.
and
that
all
is
in
the
same
paragraph
whose
topic
sentence
is:
the
conflicts
thus
raised
by
the
evidence
were
for
the
trial
court
to
resolve.
i
read
that
as
saying,
we
don't
know
whether
the
arrest
was
on
the
parking
warrant
or
not,
but
even
if
it
was,
it
was
pretextual.
so
either
way,
this
defendant
wins.
justice
antonin
scalia
there
are
two
questions.
number
one,
whether
she
was
detained
on
the
parking
warrant,
leaving
out
the
term
"lawfully".
and
number
two,
if
she
was,
was
she
lawfully
detained
on
a
traffic
warrant,
because,
really,
it
was
a
pretext
for
something
else.
justice
antonin
scalia
maybe
fingerprints
are
unconstitutional.
you're
saying
only
footprints
are
constitutional,
is
that
where
we
are
now?
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
locascio,
let's
come
to
your
secondary
submission,
because
the
primary
one,
we
got
into
that
discussion,
it
depends,
you
agree,
upon
the
meaning
of
the
supreme
court's
opinion.
but
let's
assume
that
i
disagree
with
you
on
that,
and
that
i
think
the
supreme
court
was
saying...
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
was
saying
that
he
was
arrested
on...
she
was
arrested
on
the
parking
warrant,
but
that
was
pretextual.
now
here's
the
kind
of...
your
next
argument
is,
that's
sufficient
reason
for
invalidating
it,
even
if
the
arrest
was
technically
on
the
parking
warrant,
if
the
real
reason
they
arrested
her
was
to
get
this
other
evidence
on
the
homicide,
that
makes
the
whole
thing
bad.
this
happens
all
the
time.
we'd
endlessly
be
inquiring
into
what
the
real
motive
of
the
officer
was.
for
example,
the
coast
guard
is
allowed
to
board
ships
to
examine
the
ship's
papers.
now,
do
we
have
to
entertain
an
argument
in
every
case
where
they
board
the
ship
that
their
real
reason
for
going
on
was
not
to
look
at
the
papers,
but
rather
to
see
if
there
was
any
marijuana
on
board,
or
if
there
was,
you
know,
a
drug
party
going
on,
or
something
like
that?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
don't
know
what
you
mean,
the
objective
factor.
they
actually...
they
went
on
to
look
at
the
papers.
there's
no
doubt
that
they
went
on
to
look
at
the
papers.
but
in
fact,
one
of
them
said
to
the
other,
before
they
boarded,
let's
check
this
ship
for
papers
because
this
ship
is
weaving
so
much
it
looks
like
there's
a
drug
party
going
on.
now,
do
we
have
to
throw
that
out?
they
actually
wanted
to
look
at
the
papers.
it's
the
first
thing
they
asked
for
when
they
got
on
the
boat.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
you
think
the
primary
motive
here
wasn't--
justice
antonin
scalia
leaving
aside
the
argument
over
whether
you
could
take
a
palm
print
if
you
can
take
a
fingerprint,
assuming
that
they
could
take
a
palm
print
under
a
simple
traffic
violation
arrest,
really
nothing
happened
to
your
client
that
couldn't
lawfully
be
done
to
her?
justice
antonin
scalia
in
fact...
in
fact,
the
police
had
the
authority
to
arrest
her
on
the
traffic...
on
the
parking
warrant,
and
she
was
arrested.
they
had
authority
to
take
a
palm
print,
and
the
palm
print
was
taken.
and
you're
saying,
they
did
it
for
the
wrong
reason.
it's
sort
of,
you
know,
they
brought
the
wrong
writ.
but
in
fact,
the
police
had
objective
authority
to
arrest
her
and
to
take
the
palm
print.
and
your
argument
boils
down
to,
well,
yes,
they
did,
but
they
made
the
wrong
noises.
they
didn't
do
it
for
this
purpose;
they
did
it
for
some
other
purpose.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
understand.
you
may
have
a
cause
of
action
for
that.
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
whether
the
palm
print
can
be
taken
to
incriminate
her
in
the
murder.
justice
antonin
scalia
can
you
tell
us
quickly
why...
what
you
have
to
support
the
proposition
that
the
arrest
was
at
least
facially
on
the
parking
violation?
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
clear
that
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
agreed
with
that,
though,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
that
even
if
we
agree
with
you
on
the
pretextual
point,
the
most
we
could
do
is
remand
to
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
to
have
them
make
clear
how
they
come
out
on
the
other
part.
or
do
you
want
us
to
make
the
judgment?
