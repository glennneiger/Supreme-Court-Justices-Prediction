you
keep
talking
about
this
bookkeeping.
what
law
in
missouri
gives
a
policeman
the
right
to
hold
somebody
in
jail
overnight
for
what?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
right
does
a
policeman
have
to
do
that?
is
that
common
practice
in
missouri?
justice
thurgood
marshall
did
you
ever
hear
about
taking
them
before
a
magistrate?
justice
thurgood
marshall
is
that
the
law
in
missouri
or
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
why
wasn't
it
done
here?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
what
was
practical
this
time?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
you
can
be
held
in
jail
overnight
on
a
parking
ticket?
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
you
said
the
bond
hearing
was
the
next
day.
that's
what
you
just
said.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i'm
talking
about
when
she
was
arrested.
why
wasn't
she
allowed
to
be
released
on
bond
then,
not
the
next
day?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
shouldn't
you
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
shouldn't
you
know?
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
give
me
any
reason
why
not?
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
the
only
reason?
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
that's
why
she
was
held
overnight?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so
they
could
talk
to
her
about
the
homicide?
justice
thurgood
marshall
do
you
object
to
us
reaching
it
if
we
want
to,
and
if
it
doesn't
hurt
you
at
all?
or
do
we
have
to
do
it
the
way
you
want
us
to
do
it?
justice
thurgood

xxx
you
say
that
they
couldn't
have
picked
her
up
and
brought
her
down
on
the
parking
ticket
thing?
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
was
a
bench
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
they
would
have
brought
her
to
the
same
place
and
done
the
same
thing.
justice
thurgood
marshall
what
would
they
have
done
with
a
bench
warrant?
justice
thurgood
marshall
right.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
taken
a
fingerprint.
justice
thurgood
marshall
well,
the
only
difference...
the
only
difference
is
they
took
her
to
a
different
station.
justice
thurgood
marshall
no,
no,
i'm
talking
about...
they
said
they
had
no...
you
said
they
had
no
right
to
bring
her
there
in
the
first
place
on
a
traffic
ticket.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
wasn't
a
traffic
ticket,
it
was
a
bench
warrant.
justice
thurgood
marshall
and
for
your
information,
those
are
different
animals.
justice
thurgood
marshall
that's
unreasonable?
justice
thurgood
marshall
you
mean
when
someone
ignores
a
traffic
ticket,
there's
nothing
the
state
can
do
about
it?
justice
thurgood
marshall
xxx
newspapers
would
ask
you
on
a
bench
warrant
on
a
traffic
warrant
in
the
middle
of
the
night?
justice
