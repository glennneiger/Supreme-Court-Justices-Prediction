justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
but
i
gather
she
would
not
have
been
detained
overnight
if
she
had
not
been
booked,
would
she,
on
the
homicide
charge?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
you
said
earlier
that
as
soon
as
she
made
bond,
she
was
free
to
go
out
on
the
street.
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
so
it's
rather
obvious
that
she
was
detained,
wasn't
she?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
only
because
she'd
been
booked?
justice
william
j.
brennan,
jr.
and
although
you
had
no
probable
cause
to
charge
her
with
any
homicide?
