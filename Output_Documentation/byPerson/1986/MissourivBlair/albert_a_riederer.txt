mr.
albert
a.
riederer
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
the
missouri
supreme
court.
the
state
submits
that
the
court
below
erred
in
its
construction
of
the
fourth
amendment
when
it
required
the
suppression
of
the
respondent's
palm
print
taken
while
in
police
custody;
and
that
it
erred
in
the
suppression
of
the
respondent's
confession,
as
the
fruit
of
the
poisonous
tree.
this
case
raises
the
issue
of
whether
an
arrest
on
a
warrant
can
be
invalidated
because
of
the
subjective
state
of
mind
of
the
officer
making
the
arrest.
the
facts
of
this
case
presented
to
the
courts
below
are
that
the
respondent
was
a
suspect
in
a
november,
1981
homicide,
and
that
kansas
city
detectives
had
wanted
to
compare
her
palm
print
to
a
palm
print
found
at
the
murder
scene.
when
they
discovered
that
a
warrant,
a
parking
warrant,
had
been
issued
by
the
municipal
division
of
the
circuit
court
of
jakcson
county
some
two
weeks
before
she
had
become
a
suspect...
two
weeks
after...
two
weeks
after
she
had
become
a
suspect,
they
arrested
the
respondent
on
the
parking
warrant
and
asked
her
to
accompany
them
on
a
pick-up
order
on
the
homicide.
they
took
her
to
the
main
police
station
where
they
left
her
in
the
custody
of
the
detention
unit
officers,
with
directions
to
hold
her
for
the
crimes
against
persons
unit
and
the
warrant
service
unit.
after
that,
she
was
then
taken
by
the
homicide
detectives
involved
in
the
homicide
investigation;
explained
her
rights
under
the
miranda
case,
which
she
then
waived.
and
she
was
questioned
about
the
homicide
and
denied
any
knowledge
of
it.
the
next
morning
she
was
again
taken
by
the
homicide
detectives
and
explained
her
rights
under
the
miranda
case,
which
she
waived
again.
and
again,
they
questioned
her,
and
she
denied
any
knowledge
of
the
homicide.
she
was
then
booked
on
the
parking
warrant,
made
a
bond,
and
was
released;
later
appeared
on
the
parking
violation
and
pled
guilty
and
paid
a
$15
fine.
meanwhile,
it
turned
out
that
her
palm
print
matched
the
one
found
at
the
scene.
the
detectives
then
secured
a--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--the
testimony
in
the
case
is
that
on
a
parking
warrant
arrest,
the
usual
procedure
is
to
take
simply
a
right
index
finger,
although
the
detention
facility
officer
testified
that
when
told
to
do
so
by
the
id
department
of
the
police
department,
they
sometimes
take
a
full
set
of
prints,
including
a
palm
print.
but
it
would
depend
on
whether
or
not
they
were
told
to
do
so
by
someone
else
in
the
department.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
i
don't
think
there's
any
claim
in
this
case
to
that
effect.
the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--in
this
case,
your
honor,
she
was
issued
a
ticket
which
she
failed
to
pay.
it
was
set
on
a
hearing
docket
in
the
municipal
court,
and
she
failed
to
appear
for
that
hearing.
and
the
warrant
was
then
issued
when
she
failed
to
appear
for
that.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
no,
not
at
all,
your
honor.
it's
clear
that
the
substantial
part
of
the
motivation
for
the
arrest
and
the
incident
fingerprint
was,
in
fact,
the
murder
investigation
that
was
ongoing.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
record
shows
that
the
arrest
warrant
was
issued
on
the
8th
of
january.
and
apparently,
it
came
to
the
attention
of
the
police
on
the
5th
of
february,
which
was
the
day
she
was
arrested.
i
think
that's
a
fair
reading
of
the
record.
they
did
not
go
into
detail
as
to
when
it
came
to
their
knowledge.
but
i
think
the
implication
of
the
police
officers'
testimony
was
that
they
found
out
about
it
on
february
5,
the
day
she
was
initially
arrested.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
traffic
warrant,
as
a
piece
of
paper,
was
never
in
the
possession
of
the
police.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
notification...
the
traffic
warrant
would
have
been
in
the
police
department's
computerized
records
as
of
january
8th,
1982;
which
was
two
weeks
before
she
became
a
suspect,
and
four
weeks
before
she
was
arrested.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
there
is
some
testimony
in
the
record
that
arrest
warrants
on
parking
tickets
are
sometimes
cleaned
up,
so
to
speak,
where
the
officers
go
out
to
the
homes
of
the
people
involved;
although
that
is
not
necessarily
the
case
done
in
all
parking
warrants.
so
sometimes
they
are
executed
in
and
of
themselves,
and
sometimes
they're
executed
as
they
were
in
this
case.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
it
does
not
appear
from
the
record,
your
honor,
no.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
well,
i
don't
know
that
our
position
would
be
the
same
in
this
case,
your
honor.
we...
but
we
have
contended
all
along,
what
the
state's
position
has
been
all
along
was
that
the
officers
did
in
fact
have
knowledge
of
the
parking
warrant
when
they
made
the
arrest,
and
that
that
was--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
i
think
that
to
sustain
our
position,
the
officers
would
have
to
at
least
know
of
the
arrest
warrant.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor.
the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--then
i
think
that
confession
would
have--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--i
think
then
the
court
would
have
been
called
upon
to
examine
whether
or
not
that
confession,
independently
of
the
arrest,
was
voluntarily
given.
under
the
circumstances
of
this
case,
i
would
say
that,
although
it's
not
this
case,
i
would
say
that
confession
would
have
been
admissible.
but
as
it
turned
out,
she
denied
any
knowledge
of
it,
and
in
fact
did
not
talk
to
them
about
the
homicide
that
evening.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
in
my
view,
the
confession
would
have
been
admissible,
because
i
don't
think
there's
anything
that
prevents
the
police
from
talking
to
the
respondent
about
another
crime,
once
she's
lawfully
in
custody
on
the
parking
warrant.
and
having
explained
her
rights
under
the
miranda
case,
she
was
free
then
not
to
talk
to
them
or
to
talk
to
them.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
well,
in
this
particular
case,
i
think
that
she
was
lawfully
in
custody
on
the
warrant
because
they
knew
about
it
and
relied
upon
it.
and
i
think
that's
clear
not
only
from
the
testimony
of
officer
stewart,
who
repeatedly
testified
that
that's
the
reason
he
arrested
her--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--the...
it's
my
belief
that
although
there
were
no
findings
of
fact
or
opinion
in
the
court
below,
the
respondent's
position,
according
to
her
pleadings
and
her
argument
at
that
time
was
that
there
was
an
arrest
on
the
parking
warrant,
but
that
it
was
pretextual
and
therefore
illegal.
since
the
trial
court
made
no
findings
of
fact,
i
think
it's
fair
to
assume
that
the
trial
court,
in
agreeing
with
the
respondent,
agreed
that
there
was
an
arrest
on
the
parking
warrant,
but
that
it
was
in
fact
illegal
as
a
pretext.
and
it
seems
that
that
is
a
fair
reading
of
the
court
below
in
the
missouri
supreme
court.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
trial
court
in
this
case--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--the
trial
court
made
no
findings
of
fact,
and
in
fact,
did
not
issue
an
opinion.
it
simply
stated
that
the
motion
of
the
respondent
to
suppress
the
fingerprint
and
to
quash
the
arrest
warrant
was
sustained.
the
missouri
supreme
court
then
indicated
that
their
holding
was
also
based
on
the
fact
that
there
was
a
parking
arrest,
but
that
it
was
illegal
as
a
pretext.
the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--the
defendant
is
free,
out
of
custody.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes.
the...
in
any
case,
when
the
first...
when
the
palm
print
was
taken,
it
turned
out
it
matched
the
one
in
the
murder...
at
the
murder
scene.
and
there
was,
three
days
later
then,
on
the
8th
of
february,
a
warrant
issued
for
the
respondent
on
the
homicide.
she
was
arrested
that
same
day,
taken
into
custody,
again
explained
her
rights
under
the
miranda
case,
and
at
that
time,
later
that
same
evening,
executed
a
written
confession
as
to
her
part
in
the
homicide.
she
then--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--there
was
a
physical
piece
of
paper,
which
is
the
actual
court
copy
of
the
parking
ticket
originally
issue.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
which
appears
on
pages
5
and
6
of
the
supplemental
legal
file
in
this
record,
and
which,
the
face
of
it,
the
front
of
it
is
the
ticket,
and
the
back
of
it
is
the
court
record.
and
on
that
it
indicates
that
on
january
8th
of
'82,
judge
carl
issued
a
bench
warrant
for
her
arrest,
for
failure
to
appear.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
way
i
understand
is
how
it
works
is,
that
when
the
judge
makes
that
notation,
then
that
is
put
into
the
computer,
which
is
operated
jointly,
or
at
least
they
have
access
jointly,
between
the
city
and
the
police
department.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
he
generally...
well,
he
might
take
a
piece
of
paper
that
indicates
simply
that
there
is
an
arrest
warrant;
not
the
actual
arrest
warrant.
he
also
might
not
take
any
paper
at
all,
but
simply
take
with
him
the
knowledge
that
she
is
wanted
on
that
warrant.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor.
i
think
the
rustici
case
originally
cited
by
the
petitioner...
or
the
respondent
in
this
case
actually
stands
for
the
proposition
that
a
municipal
parking
warrant
may
be
issued
without
its
being
in
the
possession
of
the
officer,
as
long
as
it's
done
within
the
city
limit,
which
is
the
case
here.
the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--yes,
your
honor.
we
submit
in
this
case
that
if
the
arrest
is
justified
by
lawful
authority,
then
it's
a
valid
arrest,
and
it
cannot
be
transformed
into
a
fourth
amendment
violation
because
of
the
subjective
motivation
of
the
officers.
the
fourth
amendment
generally
proscribes
seizures
and
searches
which
are
unreasonable.
and
this
court
has
uniformly
held
that
to
be
reasonable,
a
seizure
must
be
done
pursuant
to
a
warrant
or
pursuant
to
a
recognized
exception
to
the
warrant
requirement.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
i
think
that
in--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--in
determining
what
was
reasonable
for
the
officer
to
do
in
this
arrest,
it
seems
to
me
that
the
court
has
already
indicated
that
it
is
not
a
proper
inquiry
to
look
at
the
subjective
state
of
mind
or
motivation
of
the
officer
at
the
time.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
i
think
that
the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--that
the
court
should
look
at
what--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--yes,
you
should
look
at
what
the
reasonable
practice
is.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
on
the
execution
of
a
traffic
warrant,
when--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--if
a
citizen
unsuspected
of
homicide
were
brought
in
a
similar
parking
warrant,
they
usually
would
have
simply
a
right
index
finger
taken,
a
print
of
the
right
index
finger
taken,
although
the
detention
officers
will
take
a
full
set
of
fingerprints
if
they're
told
to
by
some
other
part
of
the
police
department,
if
it's
wanted
for
some
other
reason.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
and
then
given
opportunity
to
make
bond--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--correct,
your
honor,
immediately.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
i
don't
think
that
the
detention
of
this
respondent
over
night
is
justified,
your
honor.
but
i
don't
think
that
the
detention
of
this
respondent
over
night
goes
to
whether
or
not
the
original
arrest
is
valid.
our
position
would
simply
be
that
since
the
original
arrest
was
valid,
once
she
is
lawful
custody,
the
police
have
a
right
to
take
her
fingerprints.
ad
if
they
want
to
take--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--they
did
get
her
palm
print
before
she
was
held
overnight.
it
was
taken
about
one
hour
after
she
was
arrested
and
before
she
was
questioned
on
the
homicide,
and
before
she
was
detained
overnight.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor,
she
had
been.
that
shows...
the
record
shows
that
there
was
a
homicide
booking
on
the
afternoon
of
the
5th.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
in
the
absence
of
probable
cause,
yes,
your
honor.
the...
i
don't
think
there's
any
question
here...
once
the
police
have
her...
let
me
back
up.
the
arrest
here
was
pursuant
to
a
warrant.
and
once
she
was
in
custody
under
a
valid
warrant,
the
police
had
the
right
to
take
her
fingerprint,
including
her
palm
print
if
they
wanted
to.
and
it
seems
to
the
state
that
that
ought
to
end
the
inquiry,
except
that
the
opinion
of
the
court
below
and
the
respondent,
i
think,
would
have
this
court
look
behind
the
warrant,
not
to
examine
the
validity
of
the
warrant,
but
rather
to
examine
the
motivation
behind
its
execution.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
well,
it's
clear
on
the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--it
does
not
mean
that
she's
charged
with
it.
i
think
the
booking
is
simply
an
internal
bookkeeping
procedure
of
the
police
department
which
indicates--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--i
think
it
indicates
that
the
officers,
just
like
officer
stewart
testified,
they
were
in
fact
not
only
interested
in
her
because
of
the
parking
warrant,
they
were
interested
in
talking
to
her
about
this
homicide.
and
it
seems
that
that
is...
that
bookkeeping
entry,
or
piece
of
paper,
or
booking
slip,
is
exactly--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--yes,
your
honor.
if
think
if
she
had
been
arrested
on
the
parking
warrant--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--yes.
and
i
think
if
she
had
been
booked
on
the
parking
warrant
while
she
was
waiting
to
be
bonded
out--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
she
was
already
within
the
lawful
custody
of
the
police.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
it's
likely
that
she
would
not
have
been
detained
overnight.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
right,
if
she--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
she
was
booked
on
the
failure
to
appear
on
the
traffic
summons
the
next
morning,
your
honor,
and
that
time
given
an
opportunity
to
make
bond,
which
she
did
about
two
hours
later
and
was
released.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
well,
that
i
don't
know.
i
assume
that
the
police,
as
they
indicated
at
the
hearing,
had
an
interest
in
her
not
only
on
the
parking
warrant
but
also
on
the
homicide.
and
that
was
there--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--well,
either
the
arresting
officer
or
the
detention
officer,
or
somebody
who
tells
the
arresting
officer.
the
point
is--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--i
think
the
booking
slip
is
simply
a
bookkeeping
device
which
at
least
the
detention
unit
has
to
have
in
order
to
know
where
this
defendant
is
while
she's
in
their
custody.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
well,
officer
stewart's
testimony,
i
think,
is
clear
that
the
reason
that
he
went
to
arrest
her
was
on
the
parking
warrant
and
in
connection
with
this
pick-up
order
indicating
that
the
police
had
wanted
to
talk
to
her
about
the
homicide,
because
they
had
reason
to
believe
she
was
involved
in
it.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
he
comes
back
and
tells
the
detention
unit
to
hold
her
both
for
the
crimes
against
persons
unit
and
the
warrant
service
unit.
and...
which
is
what
the
detention
unit
then
does.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
why
the
officer
put
on
there,
booked
for
homicide...
well,
that
is
simply,
as
i
say--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--that
is
correct,
and
i
think
it
indicates--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--there
is
no
such
law,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
law
in
missouri
would
be
that
if
a
person
is
arrested
on
a
charge--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor.
and
it's
required
to
be
done
either
within
20
hours--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--it's
required...
well,
it's
because
it's
required
to
be
done
either
within
20
hours
or
as
soon
as
is
practicable.
and
the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--well,
this
defendant
was...
this
respondent
was
arrested
on
the
parking
warrant
on
the
afternoon
of
the
5th,
and
then
she
was
held
overnight
but
was
released
within
the
20
hours
mandated
by
the
statute.
but
i
guess
the
point
that
the
state
would
try
to
make
here,
the
point
that
the
state
is
making
here,
is
that
the
respondent
was
arrested
on
a
parking
warrant
which
was
valid
at
the
time
the
arrest
was
made.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
if
she
had
not
made
bond,
she
would
have
been
held
overnight.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
and
in
this
case--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--that
i
don't
know,
your
honor.
i
assume
it's
because
the
police
had
wanted
to--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--i
assume
that
it--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--yes,
your
honor,
i
should.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
because
the
police
had
wanted
to
talk
to
her
in
connection
with
the
homicide.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
that's
correct,
your
honor.
and
the
point
is
that
the
fingerprint
here,
which
is
what
the
respondent
contests,
was
not
a
fruit
of
the
overnight
detention.
it
was
not
a
fruit
of
the
questioning
on
the
homicide.
it
was
a
result
of
an
arrest
which
was
made
on
a
valid,
outstanding
warrant.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
court
talked
about
the
arrest
for
homicide,
but
actually,
the
decision--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--the
court
below
didn't
make
that
finding.
the
trial
court
made
no
finding,
and
the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--the--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--it's
an
accurate
description,
first
of
all,
that
they
did
file
this
report,
which
is
the
exhibit
no.
3.
and
they
indicated
at
a
small
box
at
the
top
that
it
was
an
investigation
arrest,
criminal
homicide.
but
down
in
the
body
of
the
arrest
report
indicated
that
it
was
also
in
connection
with
the
parking
warrant.
the
procedures
within
the
police
department--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--the
trial
court
did
not
make
any
such
finding.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
in
order
to
sustain
the
suppression
motion,
actually
your
honor
it
had
to
find
that
there
was
an
arrest
on
the
parking
warrant
which
was
invalid
because
it
was
pretextual,
because
that
was
what
the
respondent
was
arguing
at
that
time.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
that's--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--the
supreme
court
then
went
on
to
say
that
assuming
that
there
was
an
arrest
for
the
parking
violation,
and
then
goes
on
to
the
holding
in
the
case,
that
it
was
pretextual
and
therefore
invalid.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
claim
in
the
trial
court
was
that
it
was
the
fruit
of
an
illegal
arrest--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--well,
no.
actually,
the
statement
of
the
respondent
at
that
time
was
that
there
was
an
arrest
on
a
parking
warrant,
which
was
invalid
because
it
was
pretextual.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
our
response
was
then--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--we
arrested
her
on
the
parking
warrant.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
and
having
had
her
in
custody,
we
were
entitled
to
her
prints.
and
when
she
was
released--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--because
the
trial
court
apparently
bought
the
respondent's
argument
that
the
motivation
of
the
police
at
the
time
was
part
of
the
determination
of
whether
or
not
the
arrest
was
reasonable
under
the
fourth
amendment.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
well,
i
think
that
if
the...
if
the
respondent's
position
and
the
court
below's
position
is
taken,
then
that
means
that
a
state
of
mind
is
part
of
the
determination
of
reasonableness,
which
it
seems
to
the
state
flies
in
the
face
of
this
court's
decisions
in--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
i
say
that
the
motivation
behind
it...
the
officer
said,
i
arrested
him
on
the
parking
warrant,
but
admitted
that
the
motivation
was
to
get
evidence
in
an
unrelated
homicide
investigation.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor,
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice.
with
respect
to
the
second
submission
of
the
respondent,
he's
indicated
that
it
would
be
wrong
to
take
someone
into
custody
for
the
wrong
reason,
even
if
you
had
a
perfectly
valid
reason
to
arrest
and
fingerprint.
and
his
reason,
as
stated,
is
that
you
do
it
for
the
wrong
reason.
the
state
submits
here
that
what
that
means
is
that
part
of
the...
that
the
warrant
requirement
of
the
fourth
amendment
is
no
longer
met
by
having
a
warrant.
you've
got
to
have
a
warrant
plus
proper
and
pure
motivation.
and
it
seems
to
me
that
that
flies
in
the
face
of
the
basic
fundamental...
the
fundamental
jurisprudence
of
the
fourth
amendment.
if
you
have
a
valid
warrant,
you
ought
to
be
able
to
execute
the
warrant
without
looking
at
the
reason
behind
the
execution
of
the
warrant.
furthermore,
all
of
the
things
that
the
respondent
has
complained
about
here
happened
after
the
respondent
was
in
custody,
and
after
the
fingerprints
had
already
been
taken.
those
fingerprints
were
not
the
fruit
of
an
overnight
detention,
and
they
were
not
the
fruit
of
any
questioning
on
the
homicide.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
yes,
your
honor.
the
arrest
was
at
least
partially,
or
facially,
on
the
arrest
warrant
is
borne
out
by
officer
stewart's
testimony
where
he
testified
at
the
hearing,
seven
different
times,
both
on
direct
and
cross-examination,
that
he
had
arrested
her
on
the
outstanding
parking
warrant.
in
addition
to
which,
the
booking
record
that
we
have
referred
to
also
refers
to
the
warrant
as
being
a
reason
for
her
detention,
and
officer
thomas'
police
report,
written
the
same
day,
also
refers
to
that
same
parking
warrant,
denominating
it
by
number,
as
to
one
of
the
reasons
why
she
was
arrested.
so
i
think
the
reference
if
replete
with
references
to
this
parking
warrant
at
the
time
of
the
arrest;
not
later.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
the
supreme
court
of
missouri
apparently
did
not
agree
with
that.
but
it
seems
to
me
that
a
fair
reading
of
that
opinion
is--
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
--i
think
that
this
court
should
make
the
judgment,
your
honor.
mr.
albert
a.
riederer
thank
you,
your
honor.
