justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
riederer,
what
is
at
the
time
of
the
arrest
of
the
respondent,
the
arresting
officers
had
been
ignorant
of
the
existence
of
a
traffic
warrant,
but
nonetheless,
it
had
been
outstanding?
would
your
position
in
this
case
be
the
same?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
if
they
did
not
have
any
knowledge
of
it,
you
wouldn't
be
here
making
this
argument?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
enough
for
the
arresting
officers
to
merely
know
of
the
warrant,
or
must
they
rely
on
it
in
making
the
arrest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
it's
enough
to
know
about
it
and
not
rely
on
it,
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
what
if
the
respondent
had
made
a
full
confession
following
her
arrest?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
would
that
have
been
admissible
in
your
view?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
had
she
done
so,
in
your
view,
even
though
technically
an
arrest
for
homicide
was
without
probable
cause
at
that
time,
in
your
view,
the
confession
would
be
admissible
as
well?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
think
she
was
lawfully
in
custody
on
the
warrant
not
because
they
relied
on
it,
the
traffic
warrant,
but
because
they
knew
about
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
was
that
the
finding
of
the
courts
below,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
we
look,
in
determining
what
is
reasonable,
at
what
the
reasonable
action
would
have
been
absent
suspicion
of
homicide?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
we
should
look
at?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
should
we
look
at
what
is
objectively
standard
and
reasonable
for
the
officers
to
have
done
in
connection
with
executing
a
traffic
warrant
on
the
assumption
that
the
homicide
was
not
involved?
let's
just
drop
the
homicide
out
of
the
case
and
look
at
what
the
reasonable
standard
practice
would
have
been?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
what
we
do?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes
or
no?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
you
will
tell
us
again,
will
you,
exactly...
if
there
had
been
no
suspicion
of
homicide
here
at
all,
what
would
the
standard
procedure
in
that
community
have
been
on
execution
of
a
traffic
warrant?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
whether
to
execute
it
at
all.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
does
the
inevitable
discovery
doctrine
of
this
court
have
a
bearing
on
that
at
all,
do
you
think?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
let's
put
justice
white's
question
another
way.
suppose
that
the
critical
evidence
here
that
was
needed
in
connection
with
the
homicide
was
a
fingerprint.
that's
all
they
needed.
an
that's
all
they
took
down
at
the
station.
and
that
that
could
have
been
done
anyway
for
a
traffic
warrant.
is
that
okay?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
no
why
not?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
don't
you
think
that
cases
of
this
court,
such
as
scott
v.
united
states
and
mr.
lafave
and
his
treatise
and
so
forth
all
talk
about
the
fact
that
the
court
should
disregard
the
underlying
intent
of
the
officer
if
the
objective
realities
provide
a
better
way
of
dealing
with
it?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
on
my
example,
they
clearly,
objectively,
would
have
been
entitled
to
have
the
index
print,
and
could
have
had
it
in
any
event
on
the
traffic
warrant,
and
why
isn't
that
perfectly
all
right?
