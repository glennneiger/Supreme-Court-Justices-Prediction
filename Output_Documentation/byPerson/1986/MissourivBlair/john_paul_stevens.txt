mr.
riederer,
may
i
go
back
to
one
of
the
questions
that
i
guess
justice
powell
may
have
asked
a
similar
question
but,
i
think
you
said
the
warrant...
i'm
talking
about
the
traffic
warrant...
that
the
warrant
was
in
the
computerized
records.
does
that
mean
that
there
was
not
a
physical
piece
of
paper
that
had
been
issued,
but
just
the
information
in
the
computer
that
could
be...
could
generate
a
warrant?
or
was
there
actually
a
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
ticket.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
there
a
separate
piece
of
paper
that
is
the
bench
warrant,
or
is
it
just
the
notation
on
the
back
of
the
ticket?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
then
if
an
arrest
is
made
pursuant
to
such
a
warrant,
does
the
officer
take
that
ticket
with
him,
or
does
he
take
another
piece
of
paper?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and,
of
course,
it's
your
view
as
a
matter
of
missouri
law
it's
a
proper
arrest
on
a
misdemeanor
like
this,
even
without
actually
having
the
warrant
in
the
officer's
possession?
justice
john
paul
stevens
how
do
you
justify
keeping
her
overnight
before
she
was
asked
to
respond
to
the
arrest
warrant?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
see,
you
took
the
fingerprints...
you
took
the
palm
print
before
she
was
held
overnight?
