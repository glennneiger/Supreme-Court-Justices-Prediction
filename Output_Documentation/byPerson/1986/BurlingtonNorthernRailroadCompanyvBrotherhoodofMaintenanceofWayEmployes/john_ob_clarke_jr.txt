mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
petitioners
in
this
case
center
on
the
1926
railway
labor
act
as
being
the
focal
act
on
which
to
examine
to
determine
whether
or
not
the
unions
do
have
a
right
to
ask
other
railroad
employees
to
help
them
in
their
dispute.
now,
the
unions
submit
that
the
appropriate
act
to
look
at
and
to
examine
is
the
norris-laguardia
act,
the
1932
act,
and
before
we
get
into
that,
it
would
be
helpful,
we
submit,
to
go
back
to
the
facts
in
this
case
to
see
exactly
what
is
at
issue
here.
this
is
not
the
typical
or
the
secondary
boycott
type
of
concept
that
was
in
existence
around
the
turn
of
the
century.
what
is
involved
here
is
a
union
going
to
other
railroad
employees
and
asking
those
employees
to
help
them
in
their
struggle
by
withholding
their
labor
because
the
union
believes
that
by
withholding
their
labor
they
will
put
sufficient
pressure
on
the
primary
employer
to
have
that
primary
employer
negotiate.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
is.
it
is
a
sympathy
strike.
around
the
turn
of
the
century
this
was
looked
at
as
being
a
sympathy
strike,
but
it
also
had
the
elements
of
what
was
called
at
that
time
a
secondary
boycott,
putting
pressure
upon
a
neutral
employer
to
require
that
employer
to
stop
doing
business
with
the
primary
employer.
there
is
a
distinction
in
labor
law
between
sympathy
strikes
and
secondary
boycotts
which
is
often
overshadowed
or
mixed
together.
but
going
to
this
particular
case,
what
we
are
dealing
with,
as
we
indicated,
is
simply
the
request
by
a
union
to
other
employees
to
withhold
their
labor.
it
involves
two
aspects
that
are
essentially
fundamental
to
all
individuals,
the
right
of
free
speech
and
a
right
to
withhold
one's
labor.
now,
in
1932
congress
enacted
the
norris-laguardia
act,
which
specifically
informed
the
courts
of
two
particular
things
that
are
relevant
here.
first,
they
told
the
courts,
we
don't
want
you
involved
in
labor
disputes
in
determining
what
is
proper
and
what
is
not
proper
conduct.
that
is
not
your
function.
that
is
our
function,
so
you
stay
out
of
it.
secondly,
congress
said,
we
are
going
to
tell
you
what
is
proper
conduct,
and
in
section
4
of
the
act
they
specifically
enumerated
several
types
of
conduct
which
they
said,
from
now
on,
as
we
said
in
1914
but
no
one
would
listen,
and
we
say
again,
those
types
of
conducts
are
conduct
that
cannot
be
enjoined.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
that
is
correct,
but
we
don't
accept
the
fact
that
the
1926--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--it
is...
the
norris-laguardia
act
controls.
whether
the
railway
labor
act
has
an
implicit
ban
on
secondary
picketing,
which
we
submit
it
does
not,
the
norris-laguardia
act
controls
this
case.
in
1932--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--because
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
have
an
explicit
prohibition
against
secondary
picketing.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
we
would
submit
it
still
controls
because
it
was
the
latter
statute
addressed
to
a
specific
problem.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
the
later
statute,
addressed
to
a
specific
problem,
namely,
what
forms
of
self-help--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
chicago
river
case
was
an
interpretation
of
the
1934
amendments,
amendments
that
occurred
two
years
after
the
norris-laguardia
was
enacted,
and
the
1934
amendment
was
a
specific
sale,
in
a
sense,
by
rail
labor
of
its
right
to
strike
in
exchange
for
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
but
the
court
did
make
a
point
of
the
fact
that
the
railway
labor
act's
heart
was
the
duty
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
reach
a
conclusion,
to
reach
an
agreement
with
the
carriers,
and
that
in
that
case
the
union
was,
according
to
the
complaint,
simply
engaging
in
perfunctory
bargaining,
where
it
did
not
comply
with
the
act.
now,
but
we
are
not
at
that
extreme
point
that
mr.
justice
white
asked
us.
we
are
back
to
this
point
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
implicitly
or
explicitly
prohibit
secondary
picketing.
now,
there
is
the
difference
between--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--secondary
picketing
of
railroads
is...
there
is
a
lot
of
historical
development
that
has
occurred
in
the
past
60
years
that
the
railway
labor
act
has
been
in
existence.
when
you
go
back
to
the
actual
reports
of
the
national
mediation
board,
what
is
shown
is
that
between
1926,
when
the
act
was
enacted,
and
world
war
ii,
there
were
very
few
strikes.
there
were
approximately
three
strikes
during
that
time
period.
and
from...
during
world
war
two
up
until
shortly
after
that,
around
1946,
the
unions
still
tried
to
restrain
from
striking,
but
there
were
a
few
cases
where
they
were
going
to
engage
in
strikes,
and
congress
or
the
president
first
tried
to
draft
the
people,
and
then
congress
was
considering
enacting
legislation.
so
the
need
for
the
full
development
or
the
need
for
the
full
use
of
the
economic
power
of
the
unions
did
not
occur
during
this
time
period.
but
what
also
occurred
during
this
time
period
was
the
multiple
bargaining
type,
what
is
called
national
handling
in
the
rail
industry,
that
the
unions
negotiated
nationally
with
all
of
the
railroads
and
groups
for
wages
and
other
factors
that
occurred
during
the
thirties,
so
when
the
strike
occurred
it
was
a
strike
against
everybody.
now,
to
say
that
because
in
the
past
there
hasn't
been
this
secondary
picketing
means
that
there
is
no
such
right
of
secondary
picketing
is
an
attempt
to
use
the
gloss
of
today's
experience
to
interpret
what
was
in
existence
back
at
that
time
period,
which
just
can't
be
done.
and
the
first...
when
you
finally
got
to
the
breaking
of
the
national
handling,
individual
strikes
around
the
florida
east
coast
time,
secondary
picketing
was
used,
but
the
courts
at
that
point
stepped
right
into
the
fracas
and
enjoined
it.
now
fortunately,
the
fifth
circuit
in
the
1966
florida...
or
atlantic
coastline
case
set
aside
the
injunction,
but
the
state
courts
entered
the
void
that
the
federal
courts
had
left
and
enjoined
the
secondary
activity.
the
next
real
strike
where
this
occurred
was
the
1978
strike,
and
again,
it
was
the
courts
that
entered
and
eventually
after
about
two
months
they
broke
the
injunctions
loose,
but
for
two
months
the
unions
were
enjoined
from
engaging
in
their
full
economic
power.
then
the
next
strike
was
the
one
we
are
dealing
with
now.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
the
injunction
prohibited
the
brotherhood
of
maintenance
of
way
from
placing
pickets
near
the
facilities
of
the
carriers
involved
in
this
case,
the
eight
carriers,
to
ask
their
employees
to
withhold
their
labor.
it
also
prohibited
the
employees
of
those
carriers
for
withholding
their
labor,
so
the
injunction
prohibited
two
forms,
the
speech,
namely,
placing
the
pickets,
and
secondly,
the
withholding
of
labor,
prohibited
the
withholding
of
labor.
that
is
what
was
enjoined
in
this
case.
the
union
in
a
sense
called
for
a
sympathy
strike,
and
the
courts
said
we
could
not,
and
that
was
the
injunction
that
was
in
place
for
approximately
40
days,
with
various
injunctions,
and
in
the
meantime
the
act
which
was
set
up
by
agreement
of
the
parties
back
in
1926,
and
this
is
why
we
say
the
1926
act
cannot
have
this
effect
of
outlawing
secondary
picketing,
that
the
petitioners
say,
is
because
it
was
an
agreement
between
the
union
and
the
management.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
secondary
activity
was
enjoinable
but
primary
activity--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--it
was--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
courts--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
courts
considered
enjoinment--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
that
is
the
point
we
are
trying
to
make.
the
railway
labor
act
did
not
touch
what
occurs
once
the
act's
processes
were
exhausted.
what
the
railway
labor
act
was
was
a
union
and...
the
management
and
labor
getting
together
and
working
out
a
process
that
would
make
the
need
to
engage
in
self-help
academic.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
the
act
did
not
touch--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--prior
to
the
railway
labor
act,
the
law
was
that
secondary
picketing
was
enjoinable.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
primary--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--it
was
not
enjoinable
afterwards
because
of
the
1932
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
we
submit
it
was
enjoinable
for
the
law
that
existed
prior
to
that
time,
but
primary
strikes
were
enjoinable
prior
to
that
time.
the
shopmen's
strike
and
the
switchmen's
strike
that
occurred
in
1920
and
1922,
in
those
two
strikes
the
government
went
in
because
of
the
interference
with
interstate
commerce
and
obtained
injunctions
against
those
strikes.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
we
do.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
and
we
defend
that
on
this
ground.
the
norris-laguardia
act
cannot
be
read
in
a
vacuum,
and
the
railway
labor
act
cannot
be
read
in
vacuum.
the
two
have
to
be
read
together,
but
the
policies
expressed
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
control.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
we
submit
it
is
not,
your
honor,
because
in
the
northwest
case
you
had
a
specific
requirement
in
the
act
that
was
not
being
compiled
with,
and
the
requirement
in
the
act
that
was
not
being
complied
with
was
the
duty
to
exert
every
reasonable
effort
to
reach
an
agreement.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that's
correct,
your
honor,
because
the
specific
command
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
not
followed.
now,
the
difference
between
that
type
of
situation
and
what
we
are
dealing
with
here
is
that
in
order
to
uphold
the
petitioners
in
this
case,
and
in
order
to
enjoin
the
type
of
activity
involved
here,
the
courts
will
have
to
develop
what
type
of
conduct
is
permissible
and
what
type
of
conduct
is
not
permissible
where
there
is
no
specific
standard
in
the
act--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
we
are
defending
that.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
as
long...
there
has
to
be
a
violation
of
a
specific--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
where
there
is
an
express
command
of
the
railway
labor
act
there
can
be
an
injunction
notwithstanding
the
norris-laguardia
act,
because
when
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
enacted
the
legislative
history
is
clear
that
it
was
intended
to
apply
before
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
apply.
in
other
words,
what
representative
laguardia
said
during
the
debates,
rail
labor
would
not
think
of
going
out
on
strike
before
they
had
complied
with
the
act.
now,
if
there
is
a
failure
to
comply
with
the
act
the
court
can
accommodate
the
two
statutes
and
enforce
the
compliance
with
the
act
before
the
strike
can
take
place,
but
once
there
has
been
compliance
with
the
act,
as
there
was
here,
to
then
come
in
and
say
that
the
railway
labor
act
has
some
nebulous
ban
against
secondary
picketing
is
to
bring
the
court
right
back
into
the
fracas
that
congress
in
1914
and
again
in
1932
said
you
are
not
supposed
to
be
in.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honors,
the
act--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
the
act
has
already
built
in
the
standards,
and...
i
am
sorry
to
interrupt
you.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
but
first
of
all
there
is
section
10
in
the
act--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--there
is
section
10
in
the
act,
your
honor,
which
allows
an
immediate
cessation
of
all
sorts
of
self-help,
which
is
what
occurred
in
this
case.
then
if
that
doesn't
work
then
congress
has
the
power
as
it
did
in
this
case
to
extend
the
status
quo
and
finally
to
impose
a
solution.
that
is
in
a
sense
what
this
comes
down
to
is
that
the
courts
are
not
the
guardian
of
what
is
and
what
is
not
in
the
public
interest.
that
is
congress.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
with
respect
to
any
industry.
no
industrial
management--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
but
the
private
party
cannot
come
in
and
get
an
injunction.
the
only
one
who
can
come
to
the
court
to
get
the
injunction
is
the
national
labor
relations
board.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor,
which
we
do
not
have
here,
so
the--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--the
trucking
companies
would
be
the
same,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
the
national
labor
relations
board
has
to
go
to
the
court
to
get
the--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--your
honor,
the
norris-laguardia
act
still
applies
to
prohibit
the
individual
trucker
from
going
into
court
to
get
the
injunction.
but
what
is
different
between
the
two
acts
is
that
the
railway
labor
act
has
section
10,
which
the
national
labor
relations
act
does
not
have.
section
10
is
the
protecter
of
the
public
interest.
it
was
intended
by
the
drafters
of
the
act
to
be
the
protecter
of
the
public
interest.
and
it
was
the
use
of
section
10
from
1926
up
until
the
national
mediation
board
changed
its
system
in
the
1960s
that
prohibited
strikes.
section
10
is
what
congress
intended
to
be
the
guardian
of
the
public
interest,
not
the
courts.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
if
section
10
had
been
used.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
could
take
a
day.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
or
it
could
take
longer
than
a
day.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
section
10,
your
honor,
is
the
section
which
provides
that
if
in
the
opinion
of
the
national
mediation
board
the
strike
activity
threatens
to
interfere
with
the
rail
transportation
in
the
region
of
the
country,
they
shall
inform
the
president
who
may
in
his
discretion
create
an
emergency
board.
if
the
emergency
board
is
created,
all
self-help
activity
ceases--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--for
a
period
of
30
days
after
the--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
it
is
normally
a
60-day
period.
it
may
vary
a
little
bit.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
every
interstate
commerce
industry.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
to
the
taft-hartley
act.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
we
submit,
your
honor,
there
are
no
standards
in
either
the
railway
labor
act
nor
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
would
in
any
way
justify
the
adoption
of
a
substantial
alignment
doctrine.
the
act
specifically
says
that
the
courts
are
to
be
out
of
interpreting
what
is
and
what
is
not
permissible
conduct,
and
unless
there
are
standards
by
congress
that
the
courts
are
authorized
to
interpret,
as
this
court
said
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case,
the
courts
should
not
enter
this
particular
area.
now,
this
brings
us...
the
question
in
this
case,
and
this
is
why
we
are
not...
although
we
defend
and
we
submit
the
court
is
correct,
the
court
of
appeals
was
correct,
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
control
even
if
there
was
an
implicit
ban
against
secondary
picketing
in
the
railway
labor
act,
we
submit
when
you
go
back
to
the
history
and
to
the
facts,
the
development
of
the
railway
labor
act,
that
is
not
so.
and
as
this
court
held
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case,
there
is
nothing
in
the
railway
labor
act
which
outlaws
secondary
picketing,
secondary
activity.
the
courts
in
that
case,
and
that
was,
we
submit,
the
more
difficult
case
than
is
facing
this
court
today,
because
the
norris-laguardia
act
did
not
apply
to
states,
the
court
had
to
look
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
at
the
body
of
law,
the
federal
law
that
existed
as
to
what
was
and
what
was
not
permissible
self-help.
and
it
looked
to
the
body
of
law
that
developed
into
the
national
labor
relations
act.
now,
in
the
national
labor
relations
act
in
1947
congress
decided
that
secondary
activities
should
be
prohibited
but
when
it
did
that
it
specifically
limited
the
banning
of
secondary
activities
to
industries
that
were
covered
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
did
not
extend
it
to
the
railroads.
in
1959
congress
extended
to
the
railroads
the
protection
against
secondary
picketing
by
nonrailroad
unions
but
again
did
not
extend
the
ban
against
secondary
picketing,
secondary
activity
to
the
railroads,
so
what
this
court
faced
in
the
jacksonville
terminal
case
was
a
body
of
law,
body
of
labor
law
that
did
say
that
some
forms
of
secondary
picketing
were
improper
but
some
forms
of
secondary
conduct
were
proper.
and
the
court
then
faced
the
question,
how
do
we
determine
which
are
proper
and
which
are
not
proper,
and
it
indicated
that
was
one
of
the
most
complex
areas
of
labor
law.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
because
the
only
reason
the
union
would
engage
in
picketing
of
the
burlington
northern
or
the
western
carriers
would
be
to
aid
its
dispute
with--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--at
that
point,
your
honor,
you
are
outside
the
industry.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
well,
we
submit
it
is
all
right,
but
that
is--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--it
would
not
violate--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
we--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--no,
it
does
not
arise
in
the
same
industry.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
we
can
picket
a
railroad
in
los
angeles
because
the
union
has
determined
that
it
is
in
its
interest
to
do
so.
the
courts
cannot
enjoin
it
because
it
is
in
the
same
industry.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
in
section
13(b)
of
the
national...
of
the
norris-laguardia
act.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
does.
the
picketing
of
the
shippers
of
logs
in
maine
would
arise
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
but
it
is
not
the
type
of
conduct
that
is
protected
by
the
norris-laguardia
act
because
it
does
not
pertain
to
the
same
industry,
which
is
13(b)
of
the
act.
the
act
requires
that
in
order
to...
who
is
the
person
participating
or
interested
in
the
dispute,
it
has
limitations
on
it.
those
limitations
are
spelled
out
in
13(a),
(b),
and
(c).
13(b)
was
an
adoption
of
what
professor
frankfurter
noted
was
the
new
york
law
that
the
picketing
of
a
neutral
was
proper
so
long
as
the
neutral
was
in
the
same
industry
that
the
primary
disputant
was
engaged
in,
or
the
employees
were
engaged
in,
or
involves
the
same
craft.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
the
second
question
that
comes
up
besides
the
norris-laguardia
act
issue
is
whether
there
is
anything
that
is
wrong
about
that
type
of
conduct.
now,
the
typical
basis
for
the
injunction
would
be
that
it
is
a
nuisance,
or
that
it
is
an
interference
with
the
individual's
right
to
do
business,
and
that
raises
a
question
as
to
whether
this
is
the--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--it
is
not
lawful
now
unless
congress
changes
it.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
i
said
lawful.
it
is
not
protected,
and
it
is
not
protected
unless
congress
changes
the
law
to
allow
it
to
be
done,
and
that
is
what
we
are
really
faced
with
in
this
case.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
we
would
submit
that
it
could
not
be
enjoined
because
it
is
lawful--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--under
the
last
part
of
the
clayton
act.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
well,
the
question
then
comes
down
to--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--that
is
the
point
that
i
was
getting
to.
the
last
clause
of
section
20
of
the
clayton
act
eliminates
all
federal
law,
this
type
of
conduct
as
being
a
violation
of,
but
congress
specifically
limited
it
only
to
federal
law
and
not
to
state
law.
initially
in
the
house
it
was
"nor
shall
any
of
the
above
acts
be
considered
a
violation
of
any
law.
"
or
"shall
be
considered
unlawful".
and
then
it
was
changed
in
the
senate
and
in
the
conference
to
"any
law
of
the
united
states.
"
so
the
question
will
then...
then
the
question
turns
on
whether
or
not
that
form
of
conduct
is
the
protected
unregulated
activity,
and
that
question
turns
on
whether
or
not
a
body
of
labor
law
would
protect
this
type
of
activity,
and
since
the
norris-laguardia
act
is
a
good
indication
of
what
our
body
of
labor
law
is,
especially
as
it
pertains
to
these
cases,
it
would
not
be
protected
unregulated
activity.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
not
insofar
as
what
is
proper
forms
of
self-help.
the
public
policy
considerations
are
matters
that
congress
should
consider
in
devising
what
is
proper
and
what
is
not
proper
in
self-help,
but
not
for
the
court's
interpretation,
and
that
is
the
point
that
we
submit
the
norris-laguardia
act
was
intended
to
bring
home.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
well,
your
honor,
the
labor
law
would
be
different,
because
under
the
nlra,
it
is
the
nlrb,
it
is
the
board
that
has
to
come
to
the
court.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
here
it
is
the
individual
carrier
that
can
come
to
the
court
and
seek
the
injunction.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
but
that
is...
the
difference
is
the
fact
that
the
railway
labor
act--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor,
but
only
at
the
request
of
the
government,
and
in
a
rail
case
there
can
be
no
injunction.
in
the
trucker
case
there
can
be
an
injunction
but
at
the
request
of
the
government.
that
is
what
congress
set
up.
congress
for--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--well,
the
distinction
is
basically
historical,
your
honor.
the
distinction
is
that
in
1926
all
of
the
other
industries
were
not
covered
by
any
specific
legislation
fostering
collective
bargaining.
the
railroad
management
and
unions
got
together
and
presented
congress
with
a
scheme
that
congress
adopted
that
fostered
collective
bargaining
but
left
wholly
silent
what
occurs
once
that
collective
bargaining
expires.
now,
that
is
the
difference,
we
submit,
between...
well,
the
distinction
on
the
florida
east
coast
case
that
the
carriers
rely
upon.
florida
east
coast
was
not
a
case
in
which
the
court
modified
the
right
of
self-help.
if
anything,
the
court...
what
the
court
did
was
modify
the
railway
labor
act.
section
2
seventh
of
the
railway
labor
act
prohibits
the
changing
of
any
collective
bargaining
provision
in
the
contract
except
in
conformance
with
section
6
of
the
act,
the
notice
of
negotiation.
the
court
indicated
and
held
in
florida
east
coast
that
that
section
still
applied
during
a
strike
situation.
there
was
nothing
in
the
act
which
indicated
it
should
expire,
but
the
court
said,
if
it
applied
it
would
limit
the
right
of
self-help
that
a
carrier
has
and
therefore
we
will
read
into
2
seventh,
into
the
railway
labor
act,
an
exception
to
the
full
application
of
2
seventh
and
if
the
carrier
can
show
a
court
that
changes
are
necessary
to
enable
continued
operations
during
the
strike,
then
those
changes
can
be
made
notwithstanding
2
seventh
of
the
act.
that
is
entirely
different
from
what
we
are
talking
about
here,
where
the
petitioners
are
trying
to
say
you
have
to
read
into
the
act
some
form
of
modification
to
the
right
of
self-help,
which
the
act
didn't
touch
at
all.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
your
honor,
the
act--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
if
it
is
in
support
of
another
employee
strike
which
is
a
lawful
strike,
and
if
it
arises
out
of
the
labor
dispute,
which
it
would
because
they
are
making
common
cause
to
help
those
people,
then
it
would
be
under
section...
it
would
be
part
of
the
specifically
enumerated
conduct
under
section
4,
namely,
section
4a.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
norris-laguardia
act,
which
says
that
no
court--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
it
is
a
sympathy
strike
in
support
of
the
employees
up
in
maine.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
section
4(a)
specifically
says
that
no
court
may
enjoin
the
refusal
to
work.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
there
is
no--
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
--yes,
your
honor.
there
is
no
dispute
between
the
employees
in
los
angeles
and
their
carrier
that
the
railway
labor
act
applies
to.
that
is
not
a
dispute
under
the
railway
labor
act.
it
is
an
action
taken
in
support
of
a
labor
dispute
in
another
area.
and
that
is
the
one
distinction
that
has
to
be
kept
in
mind
in
considering
the
railway
labor
act.
the
railway
labor
act
is
a
craft
statute.
it
is
one
that
is
made
up
of
different
crafts.
on
the
maine
central
area
there
are
something
like
14
different
unions.
now,
none
of
those
unions
had
gone
through
the
major
dispute
processes.
mr.
john
o'b.
clarke,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
