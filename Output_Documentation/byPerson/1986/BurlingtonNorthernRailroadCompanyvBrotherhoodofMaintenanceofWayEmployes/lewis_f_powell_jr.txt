mr.
clarke--
justice
jr.
--let's
move
on
and
assume,
for
example,
you
win
this
case
and
secondary
picketing
not
only
continues
to
exist
but
expands
so
that
the
railroads
are
shut
down,
half
of
the
united
states.
what
happens
then?
justice
jr.
are
the
courts
powerless
then?
justice
jr.
so
the
railroads
would
stay
shut
down
until
congress
acted.
justice
jr.
two
months?
justice
jr.
only
with
respect
to
railroads
and
airlines?
justice
jr.
under
taft-hartley
secondary
boycotts
are
not
permitted.
justice
jr.
what
is
the
situation
with
respect
to
the
trucking
companies?
justice
jr.
the
same
as
what?
justice
jr.
i
understand
that,
but
is
there
anything
comparable
to
norris-laguardia
with
respect
to
the
trucking
companies?
justice
jr.
come
back
to
my
question,
let's
assume,
for
example,
that
half
the
railroads
in
the
united
states
were
shut
down
by
secondary
picketing.
is
the
only
relief
congress?
justice
jr.
that
could
take
a
certain
amount
of
time,
i
assume.
justice
jr.
a
day?
justice
jr.
what
is
section
10?
justice
jr.
for
a--
justice
jr.
--this
is
the
cooling
off?
justice
jr.
yes,
okay.
may
i
come
back
again?
i
am
sorry
to
keep
interrupting
you,
but
it
is
not
yet
clear
to
me.
taft-hartley
applies
to
every
industry
in
the
united
states
except
railroads
and
airlines?
justice
jr.
so
truckers
who--
justice
jr.
--trucker
who
compete
with
railroads
are
subject
to
different
laws?
justice
jr.
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question?
then
i
will
try
to
keep
quiet.
justice
jr.
what
is
your
view
with
respect
to
the
substantial
alignment
issue?
i
think
i
can
anticipate
it,
but
i
would
like
to
hear
you
say
it.
justice
jr.
mr.
clarke--
justice
jr.
--is
there
a
public
policy
reason
to
treat
railroads
differently
in
this
respect
from
truckers
that
compete?
justice
jr.
yes,
but
my
question...
perhaps
i
don't
understand
the
situation...
is
that
if
a
railroad
is
competing
directly
with
a
trucking
firm
why
should
labor
law
be
different
with
respect
to
the
two
so
that
you
could
have
an
injunction,
the
nlrb
could
bring
an
injunction
against
a
trucker,
couldn't
it?
justice
jr.
i
understand
that.
justice
jr.
yes.
justice
jr.
but
there
can
be
an
injunction
in
one
case
but
not
in
the
other?
that
is
my
point.
justice
jr.
i
understand
congress
set
it
up.
i
was
just
wondering
why
they
draw
the
distinction.
