justice
o'connor
mr.
lee,
precisely
what
do
we
look
at
in
the
railway
labor
act
to
find
unlawful
this
secondary
picketing?
where
do
we
look?
where
is
it,
and
what
is
it?
justice
o'connor
you
don't
think
that
if
congress
had
intended
to
make
secondary
picketing
unlawful
at
the
time
that
it
wrote
the
railway
labor
act
that
it
would
have
said
it
was?
justice
o'connor
--mr.
lee,
you
didn't
mention
jacksonville
terminal,
and
of
course
in
that
case,
although
it
had
to
do
with
state
court
enforcement,
the
rationale
of
the
court
as
expressed
was
that
neither
the
common
law
nor
the
nlra
provided
sufficient
guidance
to
determine
the
scope
of
permissible
picketing
under
the
railway
labor
act.
so
the
reasoning
of
the
court
kind
of
cuts
against
your
argument
here,
i
think.
justice
o'connor
yes.
justice
o'connor
mr.
clarke,
what
has
happened
in
all
these
60
years
when
instances
have
arisen
of
attempts
to
have
secondary
picketing
of
railroads?
