mr.
rex
e.
lee
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
one
of
the
prominent
features
of
our
federal
labor
laws
is
that
congress
has
singled
out
two
industries,
the
railroads
and
the
airlines,
for
special
treatment
under
their
own
statute,
the
railway
labor
act,
which
differs
both
in
its
substance
and
also
in
the
way
it
is
administered
from
the
national
labor
relations
act.
those
differences
are
designed
to
make
railway
and
airline
work
stoppages
more
difficult
and
therefore
less
likely,
reflecting
a
congressional
judgment
that
these
two
industries
are
particularly
strike
sensitive,
and
that
the
public
has
much
to
lose
if
strikes
should
occur
in
those
industries.
indeed,
this
court
has
pointed
out
several
times
that
the
principal
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act
described
in
section
2
and
section
2
first
is
to
minimize
the
likelihood
of
railway
and
airline
strikes.
the
act
has
been
largely
successful
in
achieving
that
purpose.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
congress
nonetheless
intended
that
these
two
industries
would
be
the
only
ones
powerless
against
secondary
picketing
which
is
the
single
device
most
likely
to
result
in
nationally
paralyzing
strikes.
the
holding
that
we
seek
is
a
narrow
one.
it
is
simply
that
there
are
some
circumstances
in
which
federal
courts
can
enjoin
secondary
picketing
of
railroads.
the
court
need
not
decide...
we
are
not
asking
the
court
to
decide
whether
all
secondary
picketing
of
railroads
is
enjoinable.
given
the
facts
of
this
case,
where
the
labor
dispute
is
confined,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
words,
to
a
tiny
railroad
in
new
england,
where
the
picketing
occurred
in
los
angeles
against
a
railroad
that
does
not
operate
within
1,000
miles
of
new
england,
and
where
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
was,
again
in
the
court
of
appeals'
words,
to
shut
down
the
nation's
entire
railroad
system.
affirmance
of
the
court
of
appeals
judgment
will
require
the
court
to
hold
that
under
no
circumstances,
regardless
of
how
remote
the
connection
between
the
labor
dispute
and
the
pressure
point,
and
regardless
of
how
great
the
damage
to
the
national
interest,
no
court
may
ever
enjoin
the
picketing
of
a
neutral
railroad
employer
who
is
a
powerless
victim
in
someone
else's
labor
dispute.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
think
that
the
dividing
point
is
the
distinction
between
secondary
picketing
and
primary
activity,
the
same
distinction
that
is
drawn
in
the
federal
labor
laws
generally
in
other
contexts,
and
we
think
that
that
follows
from--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
and
those
instances...
what
is
required
is
the
extent
of
the
alignment
between
the
primary,
between
the...
the
secondary
picketing
victim,
the
extent
to
which
that
victim
has
in
fact
identified
itself
on
the
side
of
the
primary--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--well,
whether
there
is
a
labor
dispute--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
and
indeed
in
any
instance.
what
we
are
saying
is
that
there
are
some
instances
in
which
courts
do
have
the
injunction
power.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
one
part
of
the
argument.
the
heart
of
our
argument
is
that
since
that
kind
of
activity,
picketing
in
los
angeles
against
a
railroad
dispute
in
maine,
is
protected
by
the
railway
labor
act,
that
that
kind
of
picketing
is
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act,
and
since
this
court--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--because
the
railway
labor
act
was
intended,
justice
white,
to
prohibit
those
activities
which
violate
not
only
its
express
terms
but
also
those
principles
that
the
courts
would
derive
from
its
policies,
and
that
clearly
was
the
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act
as
prescribed--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--all
i
am
saying
is
this.
in
exercise
any
kind
of
injunctive
remedy
the
court
always
has
to
look
to
the
particular
circumstances
to
determine
whether
an
injunction
is
proper
or
not.
all
i
am
really
saying
is
that
the
fact
that
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
in
its
terms
deal
with
secondary
picketing
does
not
mean
that
the
courts
do
not
have
their
usual
injunctive
powers
where
there
has
been
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act,
and
it
is
to
that
issue
that
i
now
turn.
it
really
turns
on
the
view
that
you
take
of
what
kind
of
statute
this
railway
labor
act
is.
the
key
to
the
court
of
appeals
error
in
our
view
was
its
holding
that
the
railway
labor
act
is
not
a
statute
establishing
rules
but
is
rather,
in
the
court
of
appeals'
words,
a
statute
establishing
goals
and
calling
on
the
judiciary
to
create
the
rules.
in
other
words,
it
is
not
a
statute
like
the
sherman
act
in
which
the
general
principles
were
set
forth
and
then
the
courts
would
be,
in
anticipation
the
courts
would
be
called
on
to
develop
the
details.
that
premise
lies
at
the
very
heart
of
the
court
of
appeals
rationale
and
its
holding,
and
it
is
just
flat
wrong.
the
principal
draftsman
of
the
railway
labor
act
was
a
union
lawyer,
mr.
donald
richburg,
who
described
for
congress
the
general
purpose
of
the
statute,
and
that
description
was
set
forth
by
this
court
in
a
chicago
and
northwestern
opinion,
and
because
it
does
really
go
to
the
heart
of
the
case,
with
the
court's
indulgence
i
will
read
this
brief
statement.
we
believe,
and
this
law
has
been
written
upon
the
theory
that
there
is
more
danger
in
attempting
to
write
specific
provisions
and
penalties
into
the
law
than
there
is
in
writing
the
general
duties
and
obligations
into
the
law
and
then
letting
the
enforcement
of
those
duties
and
obligations
develop
through
the
courts
in
the
way
in
which
the
common
law
has
developed
in
england
and
america.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
section
2
first,
and
section
2
first
prescribes
that
the
parties
will
do
everything
in
their
power
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
in
such
a
way
as
to
minimize
the
interruption
of
interstate
commerce.
now,
how
much
mileage
can
you
get
out
of
that
language,
and
to
what
extent
can
we
derive
specific
rules
from
the
general
provisions
of...
from
those
more
general
provisions
of
the
railway
labor
act?
let
me
give
you
just
briefly
three
instances
in
which
this
court
has
done
just
exactly
that,
and
we
think
that
the
inference
that
we
are
asking
from
the
general
policy,
the
most
important
of
the
act's
policies,
which
was
to
avoid
interruption
to
interstate
commerce,
is
not
anything
more
radical
than
what
this
court
has
done
in
those
three
cases.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
it
would
not,
for
two
reasons,
justice
o'connor.
one
is
that
it
was
universally
assumed
and
the
court
of
appeals
agrees
with
us
on
this
point,
that
in
1926,
when
the
railway
labor
act
was
adopted,
secondary
picketing
was
universally
condemned.
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
assume
that
in
a
statute
such
as
this
one,
which
sets
out
the
general
rules
and
then
leaves
it
to
the
courts
to
fill
in
the
details,
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
made
any
assumption
other
than
that
secondary
picketing
was
unlawful
at
the
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
absolutely
right.
that
is
absolutely
right,
and
that
lies
at
the
heart
of
the
court
of
appeals
error.
the
three
cases
that
i
would
like
to
point
out
in
which
the
court
has
done
just
exactly
that
can
be
very
briefly
summarized.
the
first
one
is
the
chicago
river
case,
which
in
1957
upheld
an
order
enjoining
the
union,
notwithstanding
the
norris-laguardia
act,
enjoining
the
union
from
striking
over
minor
disputes
which
were
then
pending
before
the
national
railroad
adjustment
board,
which
is
the
entity
that
resolves
these
minor
disputes.
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
expressly
prohibit
that
kind
of
a
strike
any
more
than
in
this
case
it
expressly
prohibits
secondary
picketing,
but
the
court
nevertheless
upheld
the
injunction
because
the
strike,
the
court
found,
was
inconsistent
with
the
purposes
and
the
structure
of
the
act.
and
the
same
rule
applies
with
respect
to
major
disputes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
the
supreme
court.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
it
was
a
minor
dispute,
and
it
was
pending
before
the
national--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--that
is
correct,
but
the
question
was
whether
the
railway
labor
act
prohibits
strikes.
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
that
says...
that
deals
with
that
one
way
or
the
other.
it
was
left
to
this
court
to
fill
in
the
details.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
justice
stevens,
i
am
glad
you
asked
that
question,
because
i
am
going
to
tell
you
that
if
you
read
that
opinion
carefully,
you
will
see
that
there
were
two
things
that
the
court
read
into
that
issue
in
the
chicago
river
case.
the
first
was
that
there
was
the
obligation
of
compulsory
arbitration.
that
in
itself
had
to
be
inferred
from
the
general
purpose
of
the
act
so
that
there
was
actually
in
the
chicago
river
case,
as
i
read
it,
and
i
am
confident
my
reading
is
correct,
a
double
inference
that
had
to
be
drawn.
so
i
think
that
distinction
did
not
exist
in
the
chicago
river
case.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct,
and
actually
the
court
devotes
several
pages
to
this.
the
first
thing
that
the
court
had
to
determine
was
whether
that
meant
compulsory
arbitration.
now,
to
be
sure,
there
isn't
quite
the
level
of
inference
that
we
are
asking
you
to
draw
here.
but
there
was
in
that
case
really
an
inference
on
an
inference,
and
it
said
nothing
about
strikes,
and
that
was--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
and
i
think
that
is
really
two
parts
of
one
argument.
it
is
on
section
152,
but
that
in
turn
is
influenced
by
what
the
state
of
the
law
was
in
<nineteen
twenty-six>
[=
1926]
when
the
railway
labor
act
was
adopted.
now,
turning
to
major
disputes,
just
very
briefly
i
would
like
to
point
out
two
cases
that
we
think
are
relevant
to
this
very
point.
the
first
is
the
florida
east
coast
case.
that
one
did
not
involve
an
injunction,
but
it
did
squarely
hold
that
even
after
the
formal
statutory
processes
for
resolving
major
disputes
have
been
exhausted,
that
the
rla
still
imposes
limits
on
the
parties'
rights
of
self-help
after
that
point
in
time,
which
is
squarely
inconsistent
with
what
the
court
of
appeals
held,
and
it
holds
that
those
are
to
be
found
not
in
the
rla's
express
terms,
because
there
are
no
express
terms
dealing
with
that,
but
rather
from
its
purposes.
and
finally,
in
the
chicago
and
northwest
case,
the
one
from
which
mr.
richburg's
quote
is
taken,
the
court
in
1971
held
that
the
courts
can
enjoin
a
strike
instituted
after
the
major
dispute
resolution
procedures
have
been
exhausted
where
the
conduct
of
the
union...
in
that
case
it
was
a
refusal
to
bargain
in
good
faith...
violated
the
purposes
of
the
very
section
we
are
relying
on,
section
2
first,
which
requires
the
parties
to
make
every
reasonable
effort
to
avoid
interruptions
to
interstate
commerce.
now,
in
all
three
cases
strikes
over
minor
disputes
in
chicago
river,
determination
of
the
limits
on
the
parties
self-help
rights
following
exhaustion
of
the
major
dispute
resolution
procedures
in
florida
east
coast,
and
the
refusal
to
bargain
after
exhaustion
of
those
same
procedures
in
chicago
and
northwestern,
the
relevant
rla
principles
were
found
not
in
the
terms
of
the
act
but
in
its
purposes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
jacksonville.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
think
not.
the
opinion,
as
my
friend,
mr.
clarke,
will
surely
remind
you
when
he
comes
to
his
turn,
is
that
it
can
be
read
in
two
ways.
but
we
think
that
two
things...
two
things,
i
think,
are
unavoidable.
one
is
that
the
holding
of
the
case
reaches
only
the
preemption
issue.
we
are
not
dealing
there
with
the
reach
of
the
railway
labor
act.
they
were
dealing
only...
you
were
dealing
only
with
the
issue
of
whether
state
law
could
apply,
and
the
second
is,
if
you
look
to
what
the
court
said
with
respect
to
the
railway
labor
act,
and
it
appears
on
page
390,
i
submit
that
jacksonville
terminal
not
only
is
not
inconsistent
with
chicago
river,
chicago
and
northwestern,
and
florida
east
coast,
but
indeed
that
it
actually
supports
our
position.
and
i
am
reading
from
page
390,
and
the
relevant
language
is
this.
"the
railway
labor
act
drawing
upon
labor
policies
evinced
by
the
national
labor
relations
act.
"
and
jacksonville
does
stand
for
the
proposition
that
that
is
proper,
"cannot
categorically
be
said
that
all
picketing
carrying
secondary
implications
is
prohibited.
"
that
is
all
we
are
asking
in
this
case,
and
we
think
that
that
language
from
jacksonville
terminal
is
controlling.
it
cannot
categorically
be
said,
the
court
said,
that
the
rla
prohibits
all
secondary
picketing,
but
that
is
not
the
issue
here.
if
the
case
is
strong
enough,
and
it
certainly
is
in
this
case,
then
the
courts
ought
to
be
able
to
prohibit
secondary
picketing.
the
issue
here
is
whether
under
the
rla
any
secondary
picketing
is
unlawful,
and
the
narrow
holding,
the
only
one
that
we
seek,
is
that
our
national
labor
laws,
the
railway
labor
act
accommodated
with
norris-laguardia
and
influenced
by
the
national
labor
relations
act,
permits
some
protection
against
secondary
picketing.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
neither
would
there
be
many
cases,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
think
there
would
be
guidelines,
because
the
court
said
in
jacksonville
terminal
that
you
draw
from
the
body
of
labor
policy,
particularly
the
national
labor
relations
act,
and
that
would
provide
a--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
two
things.
one
is,
of
course,
we
want
to
win
this
case
on
this
case's
facts,
but
i
think
i
agree
with
you
and
i
think
this
was
probably
justice
white's
point
that
he
was
making
earlier
as
well,
that
the
principle
probably
is
going
to
extend
to
most
secondary
picketing,
but
fortunately
the
facts
of
this
case
demonstrate
how
extreme
the
situation
can
be.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
we
think
not
because...
you
mean
either
under
its
terms
or
as
influenced
by
its
policies?
mr.
rex
e.
lee
then
i
think
our
case
would
be
much
more
difficult.
it
wouldn't
be
totally
abandoned,
because
under
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion,
and
there
is
a
portion
of
our
brief
that
is
devoted
to
this,
it
would
lead
us
to
the
question
of
whether
the
eighth
circuit's
opinion
naturally
drew--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
no,
i
said
that
is
a
very
easy
case
for
me
at
that
point,
because
this
court
has
said
in
chicago
river
and
in
chicago
and
northwest
very
plainly
that
where
you
have
that
circumstance
you
accommodate
the
two,
and
that
unlike
other
statutes,
unlike
other
nonlabor
statutes,
that
the
accommodation
means
that
norris-laguardia
does
not
prohibit
enjoining
activity
which
violates
the
railway
labor
act.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
you
don't
talk
of
it.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
now,
in
this
case,
fortunately
for
us,
the
rla
came
before
norris-laguardia,
so
there
isn't
that
matter,
but
even
so,
the
language,
the
approach
that
this
court
has
taken
in
those
two
cases
is
not
one
of
partial
repeal.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
yes,
but
our
view
is
and
this
is
certainly...
if
that
principle
applied
without
any
accommodation,
then
you
have
to
overrule
at
least
chicago
river
and
chicago
and
northwestern,
in
both
of
which
cases
injunctions
were
upheld
solely
in
activity
arising
out
of
a
labor
dispute
solely
on
the
ground
that
the
substantive
activity
was
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act.
what
we
are
really
asking
for
is
simply
this
the
act
does
not
prescribe
specifically
what
happens
after
the
major
dispute
resolution
processes
have
been
exhausted.
that
is
a
question
whose
resolution
must
be
anchored
to
the
purpose
of
the
act.
one
aspect
of
that
question
has
already
been
answered
by
this
court
by
reference
to
the
purpose
of
the
act.
it
was
the
holding
very
early
in
the
game
in
brotherhood
of
engineers
versus
baltimore
and
ohio,
in
which
the
court
held
that
on
the
union
side,
though
the
railway
labor
act
does
not
explicitly
guarantee
the
right
to
strike
against
the
primary
employer
following
exhaustion
of
the
negotiation
and
mediation
requirements,
there
is
inferred
a
right
to
strike
from
the
act's
failure
to
provide
compulsory
arbitration
with
respect
to
major
disputes.
what
we
are
asking
for,
we
think,
necessarily
follows
from
this
court's
holding
that
the
union
can
resort
to
some
kinds
of
self-help
following
exhaustion
of
the
major
dispute
resolution
procedures.
the
second
circuit
held
just
last
summer,
frankly,
i
think,
probably
correctly,
that
those
procedures
are
not
available
to
employers
other
than
the
primary
employer.
it
follows,
we
submit,
that
the
right
of
self-help
against
those
other
employers
is
also
unavailable
because
it
is
nothing
short
of
preposterous
to
assume
that
congress
would
have
so
carefully
prescribed
protracted
procedures
which
must
be
exhausted
vis-a-vis
the
primary
employer
before
resort
to
self-help
against
that
employer
is
permitted
and
then
would
have
permitted
unlimited
self-help
which
at
any
level
against
any
employer
must
itself
be
inferred
against
carriers
who
are
not
even
parties
to
the
dispute,
employers
who
the
second
circuit
has
held
cannot
invoke
the
negotiation
and
mediation
strike-delaying
proceedings
and
are
therefore
left
without
those
core
protections.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
those
would
be
the
hard
cases,
the
kinds
of
cases
in
which
you
would
have
to
ask
to
what
extent
there
is
a
substantial
alignment.
fortunately,
in
this
case
there
is
no
interconnection
between
any
of
my
clients
and
either
of
the
struck
parties.
we
think
that
this
case
is
especially
compelling
where,
as
you
point
out,
justice
white,
in
this
instance
self-help
against
the
primary
employer
will
affect...
will
affect
none
of
the
carriers
that
even
interconnect
with
that
primary
employer,
because
whereas
the
self-help
against
the
primary
employer
will
affect
an
area
limited
at
most
to
a
few
states
in
new
england,
the
purpose
of
the
picketing
against
my
clients
is,
as
the
court
of
appeals
conceded,
to
shut
down
the
nation's
entire
railroad
system.
and
since
that
is
tantamount
to
shut
down
the
nation
itself,
there
is
simply
no
reason
to
assume
that
congress
intended
to
have
railroad
unions
to
have
that
long
a
lever,
longer
than
is
available
to
any
other
union
in
the
country.
congress
gave
us
a
carefully
crafted
structure
for
preventing
interruptions
to
railroad
service.
what
it
anticipated
is
that
those
would
be
resolved
by
negotiation,
by
agreement,
and
not
by
self-help,
but
if
unions
such
as
this
one
know
that
once
they
have
exhausted
the
statutory
procedures
vis-a-vis
the
primary
employer,
and
they
are
then
free
to
employ
a
weapon
many
times
more
powerful
than
a
primary
strike,
a
weapon
capable
of
bringing
the
entire
nation
to
its
knees,
because
the
statutory
prerequisites
to
a
strike,
so
carefully
prescribed
by
congress
vis-a-vis
the
primary
employer,
are
totally
unavailable
to
the
union's
new
victims
once
it
resorts
to
a
nationwide
rail
stoppage,
then
the
entire...
the
most
important
purpose
of
the
railway
labor
act
will
have
been
completely
perverted.
it
is
small
wonder
that
in
the
60
years
that
we
have
had
the
railway
labor
act,
that
this
is
the
first
instance
in
which
any
court
has
ever
upheld,
that
is,
the
cases
that
came
down
this
last
summer,
any
court
has
ever
upheld
such
picketing.
unless
the
court
has
questions,
mr.
chief
justice,
i
will
reserve
the
rest
of
my
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
won't
need
that
much,
mr.
chief
justice.
it
seems
to
me
that
the
resolution
of
this
case
has
become
very
obvious
in
light
of
what
mr.
clarke
has
said,
stated
in
about
four
sequential
steps.
in
1926,
the
universal
rule
was
secondary
picketing
was
enjoinable
and
also,
more
important
for
our
purposes,
unlawful.
in
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--more
important
than
it
was
enjoinable
is
the
fact
that
it
was
unlawful.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
it
was
universally
regarded
as
simply
unlawful
under
the
totality
of
law.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
in
1926,
in
that
setting
congress
gave
us
a
law
which
congress
said
was
not
intended
to
answer
all
of
the
questions
but
simply
to
set
forth
the
general
principles
and
then
leave
it
to
the
courts
to
develop
as
the
common
law
had
developed.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
i
think
that's
correct.
i
think
that's
correct,
but
the
fact...
it
simply
strengthens
our
position
that
that
was
the
assumption
that
they
made
in
1926.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
is
correct.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
what
we
clearly
know,
justice
white...
we
don't
know
whether
they
were
thinking
about
secondary
picketing.
we
do
know
that
they
said,
we
don't
know
all
the
answers,
and
because
we
don't
know
all
the
answers
we
want
this
to
be
the
kind
of
a
statute
that
we
set
forth
the
general
principles
and
then
we
are
going
to
rely
on
the
courts,
just
the
way
the
common
law
has
developed
to
fill
in
the
responses,
and
that
is
exactly
what
this
court
has
done.
now,
if
you
hold
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
prohibits
enjoining
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act,
then
you
have
got
some
cases
to
overrule,
and
there
is
just
no
question
about
that.
now,
my
friend,
mr.
clarke,
said
that
as
to
the
chicago
and
northwestern
case
that
there
there
was
a
violation
of
a
specific
provision
which
he
said
was
the
heart
of
the
act.
he
is
right
on
both
counts.
it
was
the
heart
of
the
act.
the
heart
of
the
act
that
the
court
said
was
violated
in
that
instance
was
exactly
the
same
provision
that
we
are
relying
on
here,
section
2
first.
the
specific
guarantee,
the
specific
violation
was
not
written
into
the
act.
it
was
an
obligation
to
bargain
in
good
faith,
and
that
had
to
be
inferred,
that
had
to
be
inferred
from
the
act.
now,
we
come
next
to
the
question--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--yes,
the
cognate
obligation
is
the
identical
one.
the
obligation
that
is
written
into
the
statute
is
to
make
and
maintain
agreements
in
such
a
way
that
there...
is
to
minimize
the
interruptions
to
interstate
commerce,
and
there
is
no
single
practice
that
is
as
interruptive
of
interstate
commerce
as
is
this
particular
practice
that--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
not
that
there
could
be
no
rail
strike.
if
it
were
nationwide,
if
it
were
nationwide,
then--
mr.
rex
e.
lee
--no,
it
doesn't
say...
it
does
not
say
that
there
will
be
no
strikes,
and
this
court
has
held
that
at
a
certain
point
in
time
there
can
be
strikes.
we
are
not
taking
the
position
that
there
can't
be.
we
are
just
saying
that
its
principal
purpose
was
to
avoid
that
if
at
all
possible.
now,
what
this
court
clearly
has
held
in
a
case
that
really
isn't
given
the
play
that
it
ought
to
have
been
is
this
florida
east
coast
case,
which
also
says
that
even
when
you
come
to
the
exhaustion
of
those
procedures
vis-a-vis
the
primary
employer
it
is
still
not
law
of
the
jungle.
you
still
have
to
look
to
see
whether
in
light
of
the
overall
purposes
of
the
act
what
the
rule
should
be
with
respect
to
the
parties'
rights
at
self-help
after
that
point
in
time.
mr.
rex
e.
lee
that
gets
to
the
tough
case.
and
you
would
have
to
look...
you
would
borrow,
justice
white,
at
that
point
you
would
borrow
from
the
related
doctrines
that
this
court
has
developed
under
the
national
labor
relations
act
as
the
court
has
held
so
many
times
that
it
is
proper
to
do.
my
time
is
up,
mr.
chief
justice.
