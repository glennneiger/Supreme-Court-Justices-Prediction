chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
no.
86-39,
burlington
northern
railroad
company,
versus
the
brotherhood
of
maintenance
of
way
employees.
mr.
lee,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
say
that
loosely
speaking
the
railway
labor
act
is
like
the
sherman
act
in
that
it
sets
general
goals
and
lets
the
courts
work
out
the
methods
of
reaching
them
rather
than
the
detailed
statute.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then,
if
we
answer
that
question
yes
in
your
favor,
is
it
your
idea
that
the
lower
courts
would
work
out
kind
of
on
an
ad
hoc
basis?
there
certainly
wouldn't
be
many
guidelines,
would
there?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
you
make
a
point
that
this
picketing
was
in
los
angeles
and
the
dispute
was
in
maine.
but,
you
know,
if
you
have
a
dispute
in
boston,
if
you
have
the
picketing
in
boston
it
would
be
rather
a
strange
doctrine
that
said
you
know,
secondary
picketing
in
los
angeles
can
be
enjoined
when
the
railroad
is
in
maine
but
secondary
picketing
in
boston
can't
be.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
clarke.
chief
justice
rehnquist
that
is
a
strike,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
chicago
and
northwestern
in
402
us
as
i
read
it
is
a
statement
that
the
railroads
had
a
duty
to
do
something
under
the
railway
labor
act.
they
did
not
do
it,
and
therefore
a
strike
may
be
enjoined
without...
the
court
made
nothing
of
the
fact
that
there
is
no
express
prohibition
against
secondary
picketing.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
did
the
injunction
prohibit
here?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that
is
contrary
to
the
holding
of
the
court
in
the
northwestern
case.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
the
union
was
violating
the
railway
labor
act.
it
called
a
strike
and
the
strike
was
enjoined,
and
this
court
upheld
the
injunction.
chief
justice
rehnquist
i
can
see
that
point,
but
i
thought
you
were
saying
that
even
though
there
is
a
violation
of
the
railway
labor
act
here
on
the
part
of
the
union,
the
norris-laguardia
act
flatly
prohibits
any
sort
of
injunction.
that
is
what
you
are
defending,
isn't
it?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
you
say
that
is
consistent
with
the
northwestern
case?
chief
justice
rehnquist
you
agree
if
there
is
a
violation
of
an
express
prohibition
in
the
railway
labor
act
in
a
strike,
that
strike
may
be
enjoined
notwithstanding
the
norris-laguardia
act?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
clarke,
your
time
has
expired.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
lee,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
is
the
cognate
obligation
here
similar
to
the
one
you
referred
to
in
chicago
and
northwestern
of
the
union
which
it
violated?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lee.
the
case
is
submitted.
