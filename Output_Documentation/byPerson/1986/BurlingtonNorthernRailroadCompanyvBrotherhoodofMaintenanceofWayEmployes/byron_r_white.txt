justice
white
and
how
do
you
distinguish
in
terms
of
norris-laguardia
those
cases
where
an
injunction
is
all
right
and
those
that
are
not?
justice
white
i
thought
you
said
some
secondary,
truly
secondary
picketing
would
be
permissible
and
some
not.
justice
white
so
you
say...
so
it
has
got
to
do
with
whether
there
is
a
labor
dispute?
justice
white
between
the
object
of
the
picketing
and
the
employer?
justice
white
but
you
say
it
is
not...
this
just
doesn't
arise
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
picketing
in
los
angeles
just
doesn't
arise
out
of
a
labor--
justice
white
--is
that
your
argument?
justice
white
because?
justice
white
well
on
that
basis
all
secondary
picketing
should
be
bad,
under
the
railroad
labor
act.
justice
white
where
was
that
held?
justice
white
i
know,
but
was
it
a
minor
dispute?
justice
white
any
kind
of
a
minor
dispute
goes
to
the
railway
labor
board,
doesn't
it?
justice
white
suppose
it
was
perfectly
clear
from
the
railway
labor
act
that
as
far
as
that
act
was
concerned
it
neither
prohibited
secondary
picketing
nor
permitted
it.
would
the
norris-laguardia
act
prohibit
the
injunction
then?
justice
white
well,
just
say
the
railway
labor
act
said
we
do
not
intend
to
prohibit
secondary
picketing.
that
is
what
it
said,
and
then
along
came
the
norris-laguardia
act.
justice
white
let's
assume,
though,
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
would
on
my
supposition
prohibit
the
injunction.
justice
white
now...
and
then
the
railway
labor
act
is
amended
to
say
that
secondary
picketing
is
prohibited.
now,
does
that...
what
do
you
say
about
the
norris-laguardia
act
then?
do
you
say
it
has
been
partially
repealed?
do
you
say...
what
do
you
say?
justice
white
so
the
usual
rule
about
partial
repeal
just
isn't
applicable
in
the
sense
that--
justice
white
--in
the
sense
that
it
ought
to
be
really
clear.
you
shouldn't
just
have
to
infer
it.
justice
white
well,
i
would
think
that
the
argument
would
be
under
norris-laguardia
since
the
railway
labot
act
was
prior
thereto
that
you
could
say
whatever
was
true
under
the
railway
labor
act
before
that
the
norris-laguardia
was
intended
to
prevent
an
injunction.
justice
white
how
about
railroads
interconnecting
with
this
railroad?
justice
white
so
you
could
accept
everything
mr.
lee
says
about
the
railway
labor
act
and
still
conclude
that
you
shouldn't
win
here,
that
even
if
this
secondary
picketing
would
have
violated
the
railway
labor
act,
prior
to
norris-laguardia,
or
even
now,
it
can't
be
enjoined.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
is
that
your
position
or
not?
justice
white
even
if...
no
matter
what
the
railway
labor
act
says.
justice
white
well,
let's
assume
that...
it
isn't
explicit,
but
let's
assume
that
you
would
infer
it,
as
mr.
lee
suggests.
then
what
would
you
say
about
norris-laguardia?
you
say
it
still
controls?
justice
white
the
later
statute?
justice
white
what
do
you
do
about
our
later
cases?
yes,
chicago
and
northwestern,
chicago
river.
justice
white
what
was
the
prevailing
rule
at
that
time
before
the
act
about
the
enjoinabilty
of
secondary
picketing?
justice
white
it
was
illegal.
justice
white
it
was
held
to
be
illegal.
justice
white
and
it
was
enjoinable.
justice
white
and
you
think
the
railway
labor
act
was
intended
to
change
that
rule?
justice
white
i
understand.
justice
white
the
law
was,
the
existing
law
was
that
secondary
picketing
was
not
enjoinable
no
matter
when
it
occurred
prior
to
the
railway
labor
act.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
why
wasn't
it
enjoinable
afterwards?
justice
white
i
know,
but
between
'26
and
'32
it
was
enjoinable?
justice
white
didn't
the
court
of
appeals
say
that
the
norris-laguardia
act
prevents
this
injunction
even
if
the
secondary
picketing
in
this
case
violated
the
railway
labor
act?
justice
white
do
you
defend
that?
justice
white
all
right.
justice
white
that
is
by
virtue
of
express
congressional
consent.
justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
why
would
you
say
that
nonconnecting
roads
have
a
dispute
with
the
employer,
or
why
would
you
say
picketing
them
arose
out
of
a
labor
dispute?
justice
white
what
if
they
went
around
and
picketed
the
railroad's
customers,
the
people
who
were
shippers?
justice
white
well,
nevertheless,
the
only
reason
that
you
are...
you
still
have
a
dispute
with
your
own
employer,
and
you
want
to
put
pressure
on
him,
so
you
go
around
and
talk
to
the
people
in
other
unions
in
the
grain
business
or
in
the
wood
business,
and
say,
stop
dealing
with
this
railroad
until
they
topple
over.
why
wouldn't
that
be
perfectly
all
right?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
what
would
it
violate?
justice
white
it
wouldn't
be
protected
by
the
norris-laguardia
act?
justice
white
because
it
doesn't
arise
out
of
a
labor
dispute.
justice
white
but
you
can
picket
a
railroad
in
los
angeles
just
because
it
is
a
railroad.
justice
white
the
same
industry?
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
why
does
that
arise
out
of
a
labor
dispute
and
picketing
shippers
of
logs
in
maine
does
not?
justice
white
but
what?
justice
white
what
would
be
the
basis
for
the
injunction
against
picketing
the
neutral
wood
shipper?
justice
white
well,
anyway,
your
argument
is
that
picketing
the
los
angeles
railroad
is
okay,
but
picketing
the
log
shipper
isn't
all
right.
justice
white
i
mean,
it
isn't
protected
by
norris-laguardia.
justice
white
could
i
ask
you,
what
if
there
had
been
no
picketing,
but
the
head
of
the
union
in
los
angeles
was
a
brother
of
the
head
of
the
union
in
maine,
and
he
said,
well,
i
just
think
we
ought
to
help
these
people
out,
and
he
got
a
lot
of
other
unions,
they
just
walked
out
on
their
employers.
justice
white
that
is
a
sympathy
strike.
justice
white
would
they
have
had
to
go
through
some
procedures
before
they
could
strike?
justice
white
of
the--
justice
white
--would
they
have
to
go
through
the
procedures
of
the
railroad
labor
act
to
strike?
justice
white
because?
justice
white
and
that
is
expressly
excluded?
justice
white
that
is
norris-laguardia.
justice
white
but
what
about
the
procedures
required
by
the
railway
labor
act
before
you
can--
justice
white
--before
you
can
strike?
justice
white
well,
they
may
have
made
the
assumption,
but
they
didn't
write
it
into
the
law.
justice
white
but
you
think
they
intended
that
some
time
a
court
could
say,
could
infer
that
the
act
covers
it?
justice
white
you
are
saying,
making
common
law,
you
would
say
you
could
still
picket
interconnecting
lines?
