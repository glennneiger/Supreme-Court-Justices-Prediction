the
other
case,
burlington
northern
railroad
versus
brotherhood
began
as
a
dispute
over
renewal
of
a
collective
bargaining
agreement
between
a
small
railroad
in
maine
and
some
of
its
employees
and
shortly
expanded
to
picketing
and
threats
of
strike
activity
at
railroad
facilities
all
over
the
country.
a
federal
district
court
then
enjoined
the
picketing
of
any
railroads
other
than
those
involved
in
the
primary
dispute.
the
question
we
must
decide
is
whether
the
prohibition
of
the
norris-laguardia
act
that
bars
federal
courts
from
issuing
injunctions
against
secondary
activity
growing
out
of
any
labor
dispute
stripped
the
federal
court
of
jurisdiction
to
issue
the
injunction.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
district
court
has
no
jurisdiction
to
enter
an
injunction
by
enforcing
that
statute
and
reversed
the
district
court.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
and
affirm
the
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
we
hold,
for
the
reasons
stated
in
the
opinion
filed
by
the
clerk
that
the
federal
court
does
not
have
jurisdiction
to
enjoin
secondary
picketing
in
railway
labor
disputes.
the
decision
is
unanimous.
