yes,
but
mr.
lee,
isn't
there
a
difference?
in
that
case
the
railway
labor
act
expressly
made
the
union
subject
to
the
obligation
to
grieve
the
minor
dispute,
and
there
is
no
such
express
requirement
with
regard
to
secondary
picketing.
justice
stevens
but
the
express
language
of
section
2
first
says
it
is
the
duty
of
the
carriers
to--
justice
stevens
--i
understand
the
strikes.
the
same
here.
nothing
about
strikes.
but
the
basic
prohibition
against
the
secondary
picketing,
you
infer
from
152...
you
really
have
argued
kind
of
two
ways
in
your
briefs.
part
of
the
time
you
argue
it
is
based
on
152,
and
part
of
the
time
it
is
based
on
these
old
sherman
act
cases
that
were
sort
of
a
predicate
for
this
legislation,
and
that
that
was
the--
justice
stevens
mr.
clarke,
let
me
interrupt
you
there.
i
understand
your
argument
that
that
picketing
would
not
be
protected
by
norris-laguardia,
but
under
your
basic...
but
would
you
also...
would
you
say
there
is
any
federal
prohibition
against
that
picketing?
justice
stevens
so
that
picketing
also
could
not
be
enjoined
under
your
view
of
the--
justice
stevens
--i
understand.
justice
stevens
and
on
that
you
do
not
rely
on
the
norris-laguardia
act,
just
simply
there
is
an
absence
of
a
federal
prohibition
against
it.
justice
stevens
what
about
state
law?
justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
why
is
that
important
for
your
purposes
if
you
find
the
prohibition
against
this
activity
in
the
railway
labor
act?
why
is
it
important
that
it
was
enjoinable
in
1926,
because
you
didn't
rely
on
the
sherman
act--
justice
stevens
--that
it
was
unlawful
under
the
sherman
act,
and
i
don't
understand
you
to
be
relying
on
the
sherman
act
today.
justice
stevens
okay.
justice
stevens
but
if
you
are
right
about
that,
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you
need
the
unlawfulness
prior
to
1926.
it
seems
to
me
you
just
rest
on
that.
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
position
you
are
taking
today.
i
wasn't
quite
clear
on
your
brief.
justice
stevens
mr.
lee,
if
that
is
correct,
supposing
you
had
nationwide
bargaining
going
on.
i
take
it
then
that
even
after
the
exhaustion
of
the
rla
procedures
you
would
say
there
could
be
no
rail
strike.
justice
stevens
i
mean,
it
seems
to
me
your
reasoning
leads
to
the
conclusion
that
because
the
statute
was
designed
to
prevent
strikes,
and
once
you
exhaust
the
procedures
and
they
don't
work,
the
only
way
to
achieve
the
object
of
the
act
is
to
enjoin
a
strike.
