justice
antonin
scalia
that
statement
of
law
might
be
wrong,
might
it
not?
you
had
no
opportunity
to
appeal
it,
whereas
if
a
final
judgment
had
been
based
upon
it
you
would
have
had
an
opportunity
to
appeal
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
won't
really
happen.
i
think
the
result
is
quite
different
from
that.
they
won't
be...
you're
not
able
to
appeal
a
statement
that
has
no
operative
effect.
it
isn't
that
people
will
appeal
it.
it
is
that
they
won't
be
able
to
appeal
it
and
will
get
stuck
with
the
attorneys'
fees.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that's
right.
this
couldn't
have
been
appealed,
could
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
we
wouldn't
have
taken
it.
it
wasn't
final.
justice
antonin
scalia
right,
okay.
was
the
case
less
than
final
when
we
took
it
the
first
time
around?
justice
antonin
scalia
was
it
less
than
final?
the
chief
justice
said
that
we
took
it
although
it
wasn't
final.
had
there
been
no
adjudication
of
the
damages
yet?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
think
that
overstates
it
a
little.
that
overstates
it
a
little.
it's
more
than
that,
surely.
it
is
at
the
time
it
is
pronounced
an
operative
judicial
act
that
has
real
force,
unlike
a
dictum,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
the
same
thing
happened
in
a
court
system,
in
a
state
court
system
and
the
same
thing
happened
at
the
intermediate
state
court
level
and
then
it
went
down
to
the
court
of
first
instance,
there
would
have
been
no
way
unless
the
supreme
court
of
the
state
had...
and
was
as
liberal
as
we
are
on
interlocutory
appeals,
there
would
have
been
no
appeal
of
right
of
that
dictum,
in
any
case.
you
can
certainly
say
that,
but
the
person
who
would
be
socked
with
the
attorney's
fee
would
have
no
way
of
appealing
the
correctness
of
the
statement
that
is
the
basis
for
the
fee.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
wallace,
what
about
the
opportunity
for
gamesmanship?
that
troubles
me
a
little
bit
here.
you
get
a
remand
from
a
court
of
appeals
and
you
know
that
the
only
thing
that's
left
to
be
litigated
on
the
remand
is
something
you're
going
to
lose
on.
let's
assume
that
all
that
had
been
asked
was
either
an
injunction
or
a
declaratory
judgment,
so
you
immediately
amend
the
prison
regulations
so
the
thing
is
moot
by
the
time
it
gets
to
the
district
court.
that's
a
way
of
avoiding
paying
the
attorney's
fees,
for
somebody
who
has
basically
beat
you
fair
and
square.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
may
well
have
been
what
the
committee
in
question
had
in
mind.
do
you
think
that
it's
clear
that
the
entire
house,
much
less
the
other
house,
had
that
in
mind
just
from
the
words
"prevailing
party"?
do
you
think
the
word
is
that
ambiguous
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--"prevailing
party
in
litigation"?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
wouldn't
have
thought
that.
may
i
ask
you
this,
what
happens
to
the
doctrine
of
immunity
of
federal
officials
such
as
was
involved
here
if
you
know
you
can
get
a
judgment
for
at
least
your
attorney's
fees
so
long
as
you
get
a
court
to
determine
the
issue
of
the
merits
before
it
determines
the
issues
of
official
immunity?
doesn't
it
in
effect
invite
lawsuits,
which
is
just
exactly
what
the
statute...
the
doctrine
of
immunity
is
designed
to
forestall?
justice
antonin
scalia
yes.
i'm
asking
about
the
damage
concept.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
the
doctrine
of
official
immunity,
i
think
means
that
an
officer
when
he
performs
his
duties
shouldn't
have
to
worry
about
having
to
pay
a
lot
of
money
out
of
his
own
pocket.
but
you
are
now
saying
that
he
does
have
to
worry
a
lot...
he
at
least
has
to
pay
the
attorney's
fees
on
his
side
and
the
attorney's
fees
on
the
other
side,
even
if
he
has
that
immunity,
so
long
as
the
court
reaches
the
merits
before
it
reaches
the
immunity
issue.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
do
you
mean
by
a
judgment?
i
mean,
if
you
said
a
judgment,
you
know,
in
the
sense
that
mr.
wallace
was
using
it
i
would
understand
what
you
meant.
but
when
you
say
a
judgment
on
the
merits,
it
could
be
dictum.
justice
antonin
scalia
what
if
your
client
brings
an
action
which
he
has
no
standing
to
bring
but
the
court
in
disposing
of
it
says,
we
agree
you've
been
done
wrong,
what
the
police
did
here
was
a
violation
of
the
constitution;
however
you
have
no
standing,
suit
dismissed.
now,
would
that
be
a
vindication?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
i
can
think
of--
justice
antonin
scalia
--now,
let's
take
the
case
where
you
think
the
army
should
not
be
engaging
in
certain
intelligence
activities,
or
that
the
cia
should
publish
its
expenditures,
okay.
and
the
court
says,
as
we
have
said,
you
have
no
standing
to
raise
these
issues.
but
suppose
the
court
doesn't
begin
that
way.
it
begins
by
saying,
you're
right,
there
seems
to
be
a
flat
violation
of
the
constitution.
too
bad,
however,
you
have
no
standing
to
raise
it.
now,
you're
going
to
go
out
of
that
courtroom
saying,
you
see,
i've
proven
my
point.
would
you
be
able
to
get
attorney's
fees,
in
a
case
in
which
you
had
no
standing?
