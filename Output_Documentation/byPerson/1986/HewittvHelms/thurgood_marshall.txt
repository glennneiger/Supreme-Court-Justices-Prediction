justice
thurgood

and
they
should
have
given
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
thurgood
marshall
wouldn't
he
be
entitled
to--
justice
thurgood
marshall
--would
he
then
be
entitled
to
attorney's
fees?
justice
thurgood
marshall
so,
the
magic
words
are,
he
should
have
granted?
justice
thurgood
marshall
the
court
said
that
he
was
entitled
to
it.
it
didn't
say
declaratory
judgment,
but
it
said
he
was
entitled
to
relief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
are
we
quibbling
on
words?
justice
thurgood
marshall
they
said
he
was
entitled...
they
didn't
say
injunctive
relief
or
declaratory
judgment.
justice
thurgood
marshall
but
he
was
entitled
to
relief.
justice
thurgood
marshall
it
surely
is,
in
words.
justice
thurgood
marshall
i
don't
read
it
that
way.
you
could
be
right.
mr.
wallace,
you
really
have
two
separate
theories,
as
i
understand
it.
one
is
that
he's
out
of
jail
and
so
therefore
even
expungement
wouldn't
have
done
him
any
good.
secondly,
even
if
he
were
still
in
jail,
this
is
not
quite
as
good
as
declaratory
judgment.
is
that
right?
you
have
two
separate
arguments?
