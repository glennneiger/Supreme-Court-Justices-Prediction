mr.
robert
harold
vesely
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
case
before
you
today
is
one
dealing
with
statutory
construction,
and
in
the
process
of
statutory
construction
there
are
several
things
to
look
at,
among
which
are
the
statute
itself
and
the
legislative
history.
obviously
from
the
discussion
that's
gone
on
this
morning,
we
are
well
aware
that
there
is
nothing
in
the
statute
itself
that
is
going
to
answer
the
question
before
this
court.
however,
we
feel
there
is
strong
language
in
the
legislative
history
to
indicate
that
the
third
circuit's
decision
was
correct,
and
i
will
attempt
to
address
that
language
today.
there
are
three
basic
focuses
in
the
language
of
the
legislative
history
as
to
when
we
decide
to
shift
attorney's
fees.
those
three
focuses
are
the
vindication
of
rights,
constitutional
or
statutory;
when
an
individual
functions
as
a
private
attorney
general,
enforcing
congressional
policies;
and
third,
when
the
person
has
effectively
secured
compliance
with
the
federal
or
constitutional
laws.
where
these
policies
have
been
furthered,
congress
has
made
the
decision
that
we
shift
the
burden
or
the
costs
of
establishing
that
violation
from
the
person
who
was
subject
to
the
violation
to
the
violator.
that
is
the
pure
and
simple
language
we
believe
is
involved
in
the
legislative
history.
as
to
the
issue
of
the
vindication
of
rights,
this
language
is
repeated
constantly
throughout
the
legislative
history
and
it
is
repeated,
not
to
be
too
picayune
about
this
but
at
least
nine
times
within
the
language
of
the
legislative
history.
significantly,
what
is
not
contained
in
the
legislative
history
are
concepts
of
personal
benefit
and
formal
relief.
one
of
the
issues
with
regard
to
the
vindication
of
constitutional
rights
is
the
concept
and
the
expressed
language
of
the
fact
that
when
an
individual
succeeds
on
an
important
matter
in
the
course
of
litigation,
that
is
a
point
at
which
congress
as
decided
it
is
proper
to
shift
the
costs--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--yes.
i
am
talking
about
language
in
the
legislative
history.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
words,
"important
matter"
in
the
course
of
litigation
are
the
specific
words
that
i
am
referring
to.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
the
reason
we
have
to
go
back
to
that,
your
honor,
i
believe
is
if
we
look
at
the
statutory
language.
obviously
the
concept
of
"prevailing
party"
is
the
concept
that
all
the
courts
have
been
struggling
over,
so
the
word
"prevailing"
does
not
have
a
finite
definition.
the
only
point
at
which
there
is
reference
to
that
specific
word
"prevailing
party"
in
that
specific
context
is
they
state,
"a
party
can
be
perceived
to
have
prevailed
when
he
succeeds
on
an
important
matter
in
the
course
of
litigation
or
he
can
prevail
without
obtaining...
when
he
vindicates
rights
without
formally
obtaining
relief.
"
that
is
the
section
in
which
they
use
the
word
"prevail"
in
the
legislative
history,
and
that
is
why
i
have
focused
upon
that
area.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes,
i
think
the
word
is
in
fact
that
ambiguous.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
i
don't
think
it
invites
lawsuits
because
what
in
fact
invites
lawsuits
is
the
fact
that
someone's
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
the
reality
of
the
situation
will
be
that
where
that
has
happened
all
you
are
going
to
require
is
that
the
same
actions
to
accomplish
the
exact
same
result
will
be
brought
as
class
actions
and
so
you
don't
decrease
the
litigation.
all
you
do
is
in
fact...
you
have
the
exact
same
litigation
and
the
people
are
going
to
be
subject
to
the
same
number
of
suits.
you
just
restructure
the
way
it's
brought.
maybe
i
am
not...
are
you
asking
me
about
the
damage
concept?
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
the
damage
concept
in
that
regard,
it's
the
concept
of
attorney's
fees
is
a
shifting
of
cost
and
i
answer
you
this
way
because
the
issue
of
damages
is
divorced
from
the
decision
that
congress
made
as
to
the
shifting
of
cost.
in
other
words,
they
didn't
decide
because
someone
was
awarded
damages
that
you
shift
the
costs
over.
once
you
establish
the
violation
of
constitutional
right,
that's
why
you
shift
costs.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
i
think
the
simple
answer
to
that
was
the
answer
that
was
given
by
this
court
in
the
pulliam
versus
allen
case.
that
may
be
a
logical
concern,
but
that's
a
decision
that
congress
has
made
and
it's
the
congress
that
these
people
should
repair
if
they
don't
agree
with
that
concept,
and
not
to
this
court.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
i
don't
believe
it
is
in
fact
that
illogical,
because
what
you
have
is,
you
have
an
expressed
desire
by
congress
that
in
these
certain
situations
where
these
policies
have
been
furthered,
we
are
going
to
shift
the
costs.
now,
they
then
leave
it
to
the
states
to
decide
how
they
are
going
to
deal
with
that
thing,
but
it's
really
in
essence,
it's
a
legislative
determination
and
i
don't
think
a
judicial
determination.
congress
had
the
power
to
do
it.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
no,
i
agree
that
in
fact,
if
you
read
the
statute,
that
very
little
guidance
is
going
to
be
given
to
the
court
and
that's
why
i
have
gone
to
the
legislative
history
as
really
the
only
other
alternative
we
have
to,
you
know,
receive
guidance
from
congress
on
this
issue.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
that
is
correct.
if
they
had
not
made
a
final
determination
on
the
merits
as
to
the
fact
that
they
violated
his
constitutional
rights.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
i
am
not
sure
i
understand
your
honor's
question.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
i
think
in
situations
where
they
have...
you
have
to
remember
that
the
nature
of
how
the
judgment
was...
i
think
in
situations
where
they
have
in
fact
made
a
judgement
on
the
merits
as
to
the
constitutional
violation,
yes,
i
think
in
every
one
of
those
circumstances
attorneys'
fees
should
be
awarded
regardless
of
concepts
of
immunity.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
the
dictum
then
wouldn't
be
a
judgment
on
the
merits.
i
mean,
in
other
words
the
merits
wouldn't
have
been
presented
to
the
case.
it
wouldn't
have
been
a
case
at
law,
a
case
of
controversy,
i
presume.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
i
believe
that
both
those
were
involved
in
the
pulliam
case.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
in
fact,
the
initial
thing
requested
in
the
complaint
for
relief,
and
that
was
in
fact
specifically
requested
from
the
third
circuit
on
appeal.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
no.
that
was
perhaps
my
inarticulate
statement
as
to
the
nature
of
why
attorney's
fees
are
being
awarded.
they
aren't
being
awarded
for
damages.
they
are
being
awarded
because
of
a
declaration
of
constitutional
rights.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
what
wasn't
mooted
out?
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
his
damage
claim
was
not
mooted
out.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes,
and
this
court
has
repeatedly
held
that
you
can
receive
a
declaratory
judgment
as
a
predicate
to
a
damage
claim.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes,
you
do,
but
it
is
possible,
one
of
the
ways
that
that
could
be
avoided
would
be,
even
if...
a
12-b
motion,
i
would
think,
would
be
the
way
around
it,
to
basically
say
under
the
facts...
even
if
we
assume
everything
he
said
is
true,
he
would
have
qualified
immunity.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes,
i
believe
they
can.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
no,
i
don't
believe
that
that's...
for
one,
if
we
consider
that
to
be
a
declaratory
judgment,
the
declaratory
judgment
act
specifically
says
that
declaratory
judgments
are
reviewable.
however,
if
we
do
not
specifically
consider
a
declaratory
judgment,
i
believe
this
court
has
held,
where
you
can
show
that
a
decision
that
has
made...
even
where
the
ruling
has
been
in
your
favor
is
appealable
for
purposes
of...
if
it
has
adverse
consequences
against
you
and
in
fact,
then
you
still
have
a
live
case
or
controversy.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
i
don't
necessarily
think...
i
am
not
saying
we
expand
that.
my
argument
is
that
that
already
exists,
and
i
would
point
out
that
the
counterpoint
to
that
is,
aaron
helms
certainly
walked
into
this
case
well
aware
of
qualified
immunities,
and
he
specifically
sought
declaratory
relief
because
until
aaron
helms
walks
in
there
and
obtains
declaratory
relief
this
policy
isn't
going
to
change.
you
have
to
remember
that
the
person
who
is
arguing
in
favor
of
this
policy
is
the
person
who
is
supposed
to
enforce
the
laws.
but
for
aaron
helms
coming
in,
nobody
in
that
state
is
going
to
walk
in
there
and
try
and
get
this
policy
changed.
that's
a
very
important
concept,
i
think,
and
that's
why
congress
has
said
in
this
situation,
even
though
it
may
at
times
seem
harsh,
we
are
going
to
shift
that
cost.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
i...
the
reality
is,
i
would
have
to
say
yes.
however,
i
think
there
certainly
is
an
indication
that
their
motivation
as
to
appealing
these
types
of
orders
does
not
solely
exist
for
fear
of
attorneys'
fees,
because
in
fact
the
order
that
was
ultimately
appealed
to
this
court
and
the
one
that
they
chose
not
to
appeal
was
in
fact
the
final
decision.
the
one
that
they
chose
to
appeal
to
this
court
was
not
in
fact
the
final
decision.
all
the
court
had
done
in
that
circumstance
was
remand
it
for
a
determination,
a
factual
determination,
if
his
rights
had
been
violated.
and
they
chose
not
to...
there
was
nothing
left
to
do
once
they
made
a
decision
on
the
issue
that
we
are
here
for
today.
the
facts
were
admitted
and
the
court
took
note
of
that
in
its
decision.
i
would
like
to
stress
the
concept,
which
i
have
already
done,
of
fee
shifting
because
it
is
a
policy
decision
again
that
is
made
by
congress
and
again,
i
think
the
problem
comes
when
we
try
to
equate
what
has
to
happen
here
with
formal
relief
and
judgments.
there
is
nothing
in
the
legislative
history
that
indicates
that
they
contemplated
formal
relief
and
judgments,
and
i
think
one
of
the
most
significant
cases
in
the
legislative
history
is
the
case
of
richards
versus
griffith
rubber.
that
was
a
title
7
case,
and
they
use
this
case
to
show
for
the
vindication
of
rights
concept
without
formally
obtaining
relief,
the
individual
received
a
determination
that
the
practices
that
the
employer
was
using
violated
her
constitutional...
violated
her
statutory
rights
under
titlte
7.
she
could
not
receive
any
relief
because
the
employer
was
only
doing
it
solely
to
comply
with
the
state
regulation.
the
state
regulation
subsequently
changed.
despite
the
fact
that
there
was
no
relief,
despite
the
fact
that
the
only
thing
that
occurred
in
that
situation
was
a
finding
of
a
violation
of
the
statute,
the
court
awarded
attorney's
fees.
one
of
the
reasons
i
think
this
case
is
significant
is
that
it
is
a
fairly
obscure
district
court
case
out
of
oregon
that
they
cited
for
this
proposition,
so
they
must
have
picked
it
for
a
reason
and
that's
why
we
think
that's
an
important
case.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
that's
correct.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
the
simple
answer
to
that,
your
honor,
is
i
don't--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--i
don't
find
the
vindication
of
my
constitutional
rights
as
not
of
personal
benefit,
and
i
think
you
have
to...
to
go
along
with
the
opposition's
argument
you
have
to
make
that
determination
that
the
thing
that
congress,
in
fact,
created
this
statute--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--suppose
there
had
not
been?
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes,
it
probably
would
have,
your
honor.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
it
was
not
in
this
case.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
it's
dead
to
the
extent
that
it
had
already
been
decided.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
he
had
been...
again,
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
there
is
no
benefit
in
that--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--i'm
not--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--and
you
say
that
in
what
context?
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes,
i
think
we
should
be
entitled
to
attorney's
fees.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
because
in
fact,
the
final
judgment
on
the
merits
of
that
issue
had
been
made
by
the
third
circuit.
that
remains
the
law
of
the
circuit.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
it
would
have
been
moot
except
that
it
was
entered
prior
to
that...
prior
to
your
decision.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
it
a
decision
has
been
made...
my
answer
is,
if
a
decision
on
that
issue
was
made
prior
to
it
becoming
moot--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--if
the
seeking
of
a
declaratory
judgment--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--i
think
i
am
misunderstanding
your
honor.
let
me...
if
i
phrase
it
back...
are
you
assuming
that
i
am
saying
that
he
could
receive
no
benefit?
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
i
believe
it
is
sufficient.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
perhaps
i
misunderstood
him.
i
perhaps
got
bollixed
up.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
the
interest
in--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--i
am
saying--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--yes,
i
would
say
that
that
would
be
adequate
for
standing
purposes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
well,
i
think
that
he
could
bring
a
declaratory
judgment
action
for
violation
of
his
constitutional
rights
against
the
individual.
i'm
not
saying
he
could
bring
it
against
the
state.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
i'm
not
sure
what
you
mean.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
no,
no,
no.
obviously
if
it's
moot
he
can't
get
a
declaratory
judgment.
that's
gone.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
in
other
words,
he
could
appeal,
we
found
qualified
immunity--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--then
you
have
had
a
lower
court
decision
finding
qualified
immunity?
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
right.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
my
answer
is
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
he
sought...
i
thought
you
said
he
sought
declaratory
relief.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
yes.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
right.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
then
i
appeal--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--i
don't
believe
so,
because
we
have
a
violation
there
and
we
are
seeking
a
declaration
of
our
rights.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
i
really
can't
perceive
that
situation
but
if
it
were
a
vindication
of
the
constitutional
rights
and
a
court
throws
it
out
for
no
standing--
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
--the
court
would
have
had
no
jurisdiction
to
enter
the
order.
the
order
would
have
no
force
and
effect.
mr.
robert
harold
vesely
in
a
case
in
which
you
had
no
standing
i
don't
believe
you
would
because
the
court
would
have
had
no
jurisdiction
to
enter
anything.
in
other
words,
it
is
a
mere
statement
and
it
is
not
going
to
become
necessarily
the
law
of
the
circuit,
for
instance
as
the
holding
in
this
case
did.
the
point
that
i
would
like
to
get
back
to
is
that
even
in
immunity
situations,
attorneys'
fees
are
to
be
awarded
and
it's
not...
and
you
have
to
differentiate
damages
from
the
concept
of
shifting
the
burden
of
establishing
the
violation.
and
i
think
this
court
addressed
that
in
pulliam
versus
allen
and
one
of
the
cases
that
this
court
noted
in
pulliam
versus
allen
is
the
case
of
pierson
versus
ray.
that
case
specifically
dealt
not
only
with
absolute
judicial
immunity
but
it
also
dealt
with
the
lesser
concept
of
qualified
immunity
and
presumably
if
it
implies
that
attorneys'
fees
can
be
awarded
for
declaratory
relief
in
the
case
of
absolute
judicial
immunity,
it
also
applies
in
the
case
of
qualified
immunity
and
i
would...
if
you
stand
this
case
up
against
every
purpose
as
expressed
in
the
legislative
history,
the
vindication
of
rights,
the
functioning
as
a
private
attorney
general
and
the
bringing
of
the
state's
action
into
compliance
with
the
law,
the
facts
of
this
case
indicate
that
every
single
one
of
those
policies
was
vindicated
and
furthered
by
this
lawsuit.
therefore,
i
think
this
is
especially
a
case
within
which
congress
intended
the
shifting
of
attorneys'
fees
and
i
would
say
that
if
the
opposition
does
not
agree
with
the
concept
the
place
to
go,
as
this
court
noted
in
pulliam,
is
not
to
the
supreme
court
of
the
united
states
but
to
congress.
thank
you
very
much.
