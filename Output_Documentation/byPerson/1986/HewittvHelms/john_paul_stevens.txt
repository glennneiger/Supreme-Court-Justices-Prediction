justice
john
paul
stevens
on
that
point,
general,
will
you
just
refresh
my
recollection.
the
secret
testimony,
informants'
testimony
had
been
used
in
the
disciplinary
proceeding
for
what
purpose?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
his
prison
record
included
in
effect
a
finding
of
guilt
of
some
kind
of
prison
misconduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
wouldn't
that
clear
his
record,
though?
wouldn't
the
result
of
this
proceeding
have
the
effect
of
at
least
washing
that
off
of
his
record?
justice
john
paul
stevens
right.
justice
john
paul
stevens
correct.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
abandoned
it,
but
isn't
the
effect
of
what
the
court
of
appeals
held...
i
mean,
i
can't
imagine
they
still
have
on
his
record
the
fact
that
he
is
guilty
of
a
crime
for
which
there
is
no
evidence,
or
do
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
mean,
even
if
they
weren't
ordered
to
take
it
out,
wouldn't
one,
if
later
on
it
came
up
for
review,
say
another
charge
or
something,
let's
see
how
many
prior
violations
do
you
have.
wouldn't
as
a
result
of
this
proceeding
they
would
not
be
able
to
count
this
violation,
would
they?
justice
john
paul
stevens
isn't
that
of
some
benefit
to
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
because
it
wasn't
a
formal
order
of
expungement,
but
as
i
understand
you
it
was
tantamount
to
an
expungement?
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
not
communicating.
justice
john
paul
stevens
we
are
not
communicating.
i
thought
you
said
a
moment
ago
that
he
was
found
guilty
of
a
misconduct
charge,
and
that
the
effect
of
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
was,
he
could
no
longer
be
considered
to
have
been
guilty
of
that
charge.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
i
guess
he's
back
in
now.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so,
what
you
are
saying
is,
even
if
one
could
construe
the
proceedings
as
removing
the
stigma
of
conviction,
whatever
it
is,
it
really
wouldn't
have
made
him
a
prevailing
party
because
he
had
no
interest
in
the
nature
of
his
prison
record
after
he
was
released?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
one
other
question.
this
was
not
a
class
action,
was
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
when
we
reviewed
the
custody
issue,
had
he
already
been
released
from
prison?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
guess
we...
did
we
review
a
moot
case
then?
if
he
was
out
of
prison--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--but
the
administrative
custody
issue,
did
that
involve
the
claim
for
damages
or
was
that
injunctive
relief?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
before
you
get
them
all
out
here,
he
got
more
than
a
declaration
of
law.
didn't
he
get
a
declaration
that
the
factual
basis
for
the
finding
of
misconduct
was
unconstitutionally
obtained?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
is
it
not
true
that
it
is
also
a
judicial
statement
that
could
have
been
made
the
subject
of
a
petition
for
certiorari
to
this
court
if
you
wanted
to
review
it,
if
pennsylvania
wanted
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
there
would
have
been
no
jurisdictional
objection
even
though
it
would
have
been
non-final
and
as
a
matter
of
discretion
we
probably
would
have
denied
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
they
did
in
this
very
case,
at
that
very
time--
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
don't
think
if
he
had
asked
for
it,
that
he
could
have
had
that
order
expunged,
the
misconduct?
justice
john
paul
stevens
or
he
might
be
asked
to
fill
out
an
employment
application
on,
"what
were
your
misconduct
violations
in
jail.
"
and
he'd
say
none
in
one
case,
and
he'd
say
in
the
other
case,
"i
beat
up
the
guard",
or
whatever
it
was.
that's
not
enough?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
he
was
paroled
and
that
is
what
mooted
his
claim,
wasn't
it?
he
was
paroled;
isn't
that
what
largely
mooted
the
claim?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
i
take
it
that
was...
they
didn't
have
to
parole
him?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
vesely,
i
think
there
is
some
inconsistency
in
your
answer.
on
the
one
hand
you
say,
as
i
understand
you
correctly,
that
the
vindication
of
your
client's
constitutional
rights
is
sufficient
to
make
him
a
prevailing
party?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
you
acknowledge
in
questioning
by
justice
white
that
the
vindication
of
your
client's
constitutional
rights
when
he
has
no
claim
for
damages
is
not
sufficient
to
prevent
the
case
from
becoming
moot.
now,
how
can
something
that's
not
strong
enough...
it
doesn't
take
much
to
keep
the
case
from
getting
moot.
how
can
that
be
enough
to
make
you
a
prevailing
party
if
it
isn't
enough
to
keep
the
case
alive?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
the
question
is
whether
there
is
not
inconsistency
between
your
concession
that
the
case
had
become
moot
or
would
be
moot
as
long
as
there
was
no
viable
claim
for
damage
left.
you
are
saying
that
the
interest
in
a
vindication
of
constitutional
rights
on
behalf
of
your
client
is
not
enough
to
save
the
case
from
becoming
moot?
i
don't
know
how
you
can
say
that
and
also
say
it's
enough
to
entitle
you
to
fees.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
but
you
said
your
request
for
declaratory
judgment
would
have
been
moot
if
you
were
not
also
asking
for
damages.
you
seem
to
have
conceded
that
there's
not
enough
left,
that
the
interest
in
a
declaratory
judgment
vindicating
your
client's
rights
was
not
of
any
benefit
to
your
client
after
he
was
discharged
on
parole.
i
have
some
question
about
whether
that
is
right,
but
you
seem
to
be
willing
to
give
it
up.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
you
are
saying
the
case
is
moot,
the
reason
it
is
moot
is
there
is
no
adversary
interested
in
the
result
of
the
case
any
more.
if
he
has
something
of
value
he
is
seeking,
namely
a
vindication
of
his
constitutional
rights,
and
if
that's
sufficient
to
justify
the
payment
of
fees,
it
is
puzzling
to
me
why
you
would
concede
that
it's
not
sufficient
to
keep
the
case
alive.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that's
not
the
way
you
answered
justice
white.
justice
john
paul
stevens
you
said
his
interest
in
a
declaratory
judgment
would
not
prevent
the
case
from
being
moot.
now,
you
may
be
changing
your
mind,
but
you
can't...
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
you
can
both
concede
that
and
also
say
it's
enough
to
make
him
a
prevailing
party.
justice
john
paul
stevens
the
interest
in
vindicating
his
constitutional
rights.
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
is
what
would
support
a
declaratory
judgment.
