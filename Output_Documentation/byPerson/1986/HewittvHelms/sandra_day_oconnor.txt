mr.
vesely,
if
the
court
below
had
decided
the
question
of
immunity
first
and
had
found
that
the
officers
had
immunity
for
their
actions,
i
suppose
you
wouldn't
be
here
claiming
attorney's
fees?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
why
should
the
result
be
any
different
if
at
the
end
of
the
line
they
determine
there
is
immunity,
but
in
the
meantime
have
something
to
say
about
the
merits?
it's
just
kind
of
illogical.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
suppose
at
the
end
of
the
line
when
the
case
is
all
over
and
done
with,
the
court
decides
the
officers
are
immune.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
in
the
process
of
doing
that
makes
comments
in
the
course
of
the
opinion
about
the
merits
of
the
underlying
violation.
do
you
think
you
are
entitled
to
recover
them?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
but
all
these
are
live
cases
of
controversy.
you
go
to
trial
on
these
1983
cases
and
you
say,
"my
constitutional
rights
have
been
violated.
"
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
the
officer
comes
back
and
says,
"but
i'm
entitled
a
defense
of
good
faith
immunity.
"
now,
the
court
has
its
option
in
whether
to
talk
first
about
the
merits
or
first
about
immunity.
maybe
most
courts
go
directly
to
immunity,
but
we've
got
a
situation
were
where
in
the
process
of
handling
the
case
the
court
had
something
to
say
about
the
merits.
now,
why
should
that
determine,
at
the
end
of
the
line,
whether
attorney's
fees
are
recovered
or
not?
mr.
vesely,
i
think
we
have
held
here
that
the
immunity
defense
is
no
bar
to
an
injunction.
