mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fee
provision
and
other
fee
award
statutes
enacted
by
congress
provide
for
the
award
of
attorney's
fees
to
prevailing
parties
as
an
incident
of
litigation
in
which
those
parties
succeed
on
the
merits
of
their
claims.
these
statutes
are
not
intended
to
exalt
attorneys'
fees
into
a
self-generating
force
that
will
drive
the
merits
litigation
or
transform
the
nature
of
the
merits
litigation.
that
is
the
basic
theme
of
the
brief
that
we
have
filed,
and
we
believe
a
fundamental
principle
reflected
in
this
court's
decisions
under
the
attorneys'
fees
statutes,
and
preservation
of
that
principle
requires
in
our
view
insistence
that
the
statutory
term
"prevailing
party"
be
given
meaningful
and
manageable
content.
to
be
a
prevailing
party,
the
plaintiff
must
receive
some
practical
relief
or
benefit
for
himself
on
the
merits
of
his
claim,
whether
by
judgment,
by
settlement,
by
consent
decree
or
by
voluntary
action
taken
by
the
defendant,
and
here
the
respondent
did
not
receive
any
such
benefit
or
relief.
his
damages
claims
were
held
barred
by
immunity,
and
he
failed
to
pursue
any
of
his
equitable
claims
presumably
because
they
were
moot
since
he
was
no
longer
in
prison.
now,
it
is
true
that
the
court
of
appeals
said
on
his
first
appeal
that
his
rights
had
been
violated
but
it
did
not
rule
on
whether
he
was
entitled
to
any
relief.
this
court's
decisions
make
clear
that
a
litigant
is
not
automatically
entitled
to
equitable
relief,
whether
declaratory
relief
or
injunctive
relief,
merely
because
a
court
agrees
with
his
contention
on
the
merits.
a
judgment
in
his
favor
may
nonetheless
be
precluded
by
mootness,
by
lack
of
standing,
by
case
of
controversy
limitations,
by
equitable
considerations.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
then
it
would
have
ruled
that
he
was
entitled
to
relief
and
i
think
we
would
have
a
substantially
different--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
could
be
a
basis
for
a
fee.
that
would
then
bring
in
the
criteria
that
this
court
talked
about
in
hensley
against
eckerhart
of
whether
he
prevailed
on
a
substantial
part
of
what
he
was
seeking.
of
course,
that
would
have
been
a
quite
different
ruling.
what
he
got
from
the
court
of
appeals
ultimately
was
no
different
than
if
the
district
court
in
the
first
place
had
rejected
his
claim
on
grounds
of
immunity
and
mootness
and
the
court
of
appeals
had
merely
affirmed
that
but
citing
dictum
about,
you
know,
if
they
weren't
barred
by
mootness
and
immunity
we
think
he
would
indeed
have
a
meritorious
claim
and
his
rights
were
violated.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
exactly
so,
mr.
chief
justice.
i
have
many
of
them
in
hand
here.
it's
just
what
i
had
in
mind.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is...
one
could
call
it
a
declaration.
the
court
of
appeals
subsequently
said
it
was
a
declaration.
but
it
was
the
functional
equivalent
of
saying
the
same
thing
in
dictum,
as
i
said
if
the
district
court
had
in
the
first
place
rejected
his
claims
on
grounds
of
immunity
and
mootness
and
then
he
had
appealed
to
the
court
of
appeals
and
they
affirmed
that
judgment
but
said
in
the
opinion
that
were
it
not
for
that,
it's
true
that
he
was
barred,
it's
the
functional
equivalent.
they
never
ruled
that
he--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
remanded
the
case
for
a
determination
of
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--it
could
have.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
it
is
equally
true
that
a
petition
for
certiorari
before
a
judgment
could
have
been
filed
before
the
court
of
appeals
had
ruled
at
all.
but
it
is
hard
to
persuade
the
court
to
grant
review
in
an
interlocutory
posture.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
the
court
did...
in
this
very
case
with
respect
to
an
issue
that
it
concluded
warranted
review,
but
that
is
a
rather
exceptional
circumstance.
it
does
happen.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct.
there
was
a
grant
of
certiorari.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice,
nor
would
there
have
been
any
right
of
review
from
this
court
in
the
hypothetical
case
i
have
posited
where
it
was
purely
dictum
by
the
court
of
appeals
which
was
affirming
the
rejection
of
his
claim
but
which
i
think
is
the
functional
equivalent
for
purposes
of
whether
he
was
a
prevailing
party
because
he
got
no
more
and
no
less
than
he
would
have
gotten
in
that
situation.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
then
he
would
have
prevailed
to
that
extent,
because
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
court
would
have
ruled
that
he
was
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment,
then.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
he
would
at
least
be
entitled
if
he
met
the--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--well,
they--
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
--no,
mr.
justice,
because
by
the
time
the
court
of
appeals
ruled,
he
was
not
in
jail
and
there
was
a
serious
question
about
whether
a
declaratory
judgment
should
issue
on
the
supposition
that
he
might
commit
another
crime
and
go
back
to
jail
sometime
in
the
future.
well,
the
court
of
appeals
never
tried
it
out.
they
never
ruled
on
that.
they
never
said
he
was
entitled
to
relief.
that's
my
point.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
that's
right.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
didn't
say
he
was
entitled
to
relief.
they
said
his
right
had
been
violated.
that's
different.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
they
said
his
right
had
been
violated
and
he'll
get
damages
unless
there's
immunity.
that's
what
they
said.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
i
would
say
my
second
point
is
understated
by
saying
it's
not
quite
as
good.
i
don't
think
he
was
entitled
to
a
declaratory
judgment
because
his
case
was
moot,
in
seeking
equitable
relief.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
probably
not
because
he
was
no
longer
in
jail
and
the
only
basis
on
which
his
case
would
not
be
moot
would
be
for
the
court
to
be
willing
to
assume
he
might
commit
another
crime
and
go
back
to
jail.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
i
don't
think
so.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
someone
can
be
a
prevailing
party
if
the
defendant
has
taken
voluntary
action
that
moots
out
his
claim.
we
readily
concede
that
and
the
cases
establish
that.
but,
the
catalyst
concept
should
not
be
extended
to
a
situation
where
it
has
no
effect
on
his
litigation
and
he
didn't
prevail
in
any
way,
and
it
doesn't
extend
the
rule
more
generally
that
he
prevailed
on.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
yes.
mr.
lawrence
g.
wallace
well,
but
those
standards
have
nothing
to
do
with
whether
he
had
a
pending
claim.
that
is
a
determination
made
wholly
independently
of
the
lawsuit.
