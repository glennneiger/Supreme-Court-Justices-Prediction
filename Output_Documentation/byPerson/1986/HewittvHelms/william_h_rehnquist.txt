mr.
saylor,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
resume
at
1:00
o'clock.
mr.
saylor,
you
may
proceed.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
we
took
one
part
of
the
case
on
petition
for
certiorari
when
it
was
not
final.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
saylor.
we
will
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
wallace.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
wallace,
i
am
right
here.
isn't
it
true
that
in
some
of
our
case
we
have
said
that
requests
for
declaratory
judgments
are
subject
to
the
same
limitations
as
requests
for
injunctions;
that
is,
that
you
don't
just
simply
come
in
and
say,
i
wanted
that
declaration
of
the
law,
period.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
wallace.
we
will
hear
from
you
now,
mr.
vesely.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
are
talking
about
expressed
language
of
legislative
history?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
not--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--so,
now
we
talk
about
expressed
language
in
the
statute
but
about
expressed
language
in
the
legislative
history?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
the
very
fact
that
the
conclusion
does
prove
troubling
is
some
reason
to
look
closely
at
whether
congress
really
mandated
it.
and
certainly
it
didn't
mandate
it
in
the
statutory
language.
i'm
not
sure
that
i
would
be
persuaded
simply
by
quotations
from
the
legislative
history
in
one
house,
if
the
result
seems
that
illogical.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
the
congress
exercised
that
power
by
saying
that
a
prevailing
party
should
recover
attorneys'
fees.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
that's
what
congress
said.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
and
you're
asking
us
to
draw
what
may
seem
to
some
of
us
quite
an
illogical
conclusion
from
it,
and
you
are
saying
that
congress
directed
us
to
do
it.
well,
congress
didn't
direct
us
to
draw
that
in
the
language
of
the
statute.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
if
a
plaintiff
in
a
case
similar
to
this
sues
for
damages
and
says,
my
rights
have
been
violated
by
these
prison
regulations
or
prison
practices
and
i
want
a
judgment
for
damages.
and
the
state
comes
in
and
says,
we
think
you
are
wrong
on
the
merits.
we
also
think
we
are
entitled
to
immunity.
and
the
district
court
says,
yes,
your
rights
were
violated
but
we
think
the
defendants
are
entitled
to
official
immunity.
now,
can
the
defendants
appeal
from
that
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
under
what
theory?
i
thought
you
had
to
be
a
losing
party
to
appeal
from
a
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
so,
then
we
are
going
to
expand
the
class
of
appealable
orders
from
the
district
court
by
virtue
of
the
potential
for
attorneys'
fees?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
would
also
agree,
wouldn't
you,
that
you
are
going
to
have
more
appealable
orders
under
your
theory
than
under
your
opponent's
theory,
officials
are
going
to
be
able
to
appeal
more
often
and
will
probably
be
motivated
to
appeal
more
often?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
analogize
it,
then,
really
to
an
action
for
damages
rather
than
to
an
injunctive
action?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i've
always
thought
that
a
declaratory
judgment
was
kind
of
over
on
the
same
side
of
the
line
with
an
action
for
an
injunction
on
the
equity
side,
so
to
speak,
and
the
damages
action
is
on
the
other
side.
but
you
say
that
even
though
the
thing
is
moot
and
he
is
not
getting
damages
he
could
still
get
a
declaratory
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
you
say
that
he
can
appeal
and
ask
for
a
declaratory
judgment
under
the
circumstance
justice
white
gave
you?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
the
lower
court
says
it
doesn't
make
any
difference
whether
it's
a
violation
of
the
constitutional
rights
or
not
because
i
find
as
a
matter
of
law
there
is
immunity.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
can
the
plaintiff
appeal
from
that
and
say,
maybe
there's
immunity
but
i
want
a
declaration
of
my
constitutional
rights?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
even
though
all
he
seeks
is
damages;
even
though
all
he
sought
in
the
lower
court
is
damages?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
okay.
if
he
seeks
both
declaratory
relief
and
damages--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--and
the
lower
court
says...
well,
then
the
lower
court
would
have
to
pass
on
the
declaratory
judgment
issue,
so
that
that,
perhaps
is
a
different
question?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
vesely.
mr.
saylor,
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
saylor.
the
case
is
submitted.
