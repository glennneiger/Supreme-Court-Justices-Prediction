justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
ever
a
judgment
that
the
use
of
secret
testimony
was
illegal?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
the
district
court?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
the
district
court...
what
did
the
district
court
hold
on
remand?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
what
it
it
had
held
that
they
were
not
immune?
then
all
the
district
court
would
have
had
to
do
was
determine
the
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
there
would
have
been
a
judgment
already...
it
would
have
been
required
by
the
court
of
appeals'
holding
or
opinion
for
the
district
court
to
say
that
the
use
of
the
secret
testimony
was
violative
of
due
process?
justice
byron
r.
white
right,
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
so
that,
the
district
court
had
nothing
more
to
do
with
the
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly,
exactly.
and
if
it
had
found...
if
they
had
found
no
immunity
it
would
have
gone
on
to
determine
damages,
wouldn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
isn't
equivalent
to
his
having
obtained
a
declaratory
judgment?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
if
no
immunity...
you
enter
summary
judgment--
justice
byron
r.
white
--as
a
predicate
to...
before
you
order
damages
you
have
to
find
that
somebody
has
done
something
wrong.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
determined
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
okay.
justice
byron
r.
white
--directed
the
entry
of
a
declaratory
judgment
in
his
favor--
justice
byron
r.
white
--no,
no,
but
no
other...
is
a
declaratory
judgment
by
itself
without
any
claim
for
damages
a
basis
for
a
fee?
justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
all
we
did
was
we
granted
certiorari
from
a
judgment
of
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
before
it
was
final,
but
there
is
no
need
for
finality
from
the
federal
court.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
it
isn't
any
bar
to
a
declaratory
judgment.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
court
of
appeals
here
said
that
this
complaint
included
a
claim
for
a
declaratory
judgment.
did
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
even
if
there
had
been
a
holding
of
immunity
that
wouldn't
have
entered
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
what
do
you
think
wasn't
mooted
out
by
his
release?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
was
not
mooted
out
by
his
release?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
almost
have
to...
you
almost
have
to
whether
you
call
it
a
declaratory
judgment
or
not.
you
have
to
establish
what
the
law
is
as
a
predicate
for
a
damage
suit.
justice
byron
r.
white
when
this
case
was
here
before,
he
had
already
been
released
from
prison?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
his
only
interest
at
that
time
in
the
case
was
the
fact
that
there
was
a
damages
claim
pending?
justice
byron
r.
white
he
could
at
that
time
get
no
personal
benefit
out
of
the
declaratory
judgment
phase
of
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
think
we
noted,
didn't
we,
at
that
time
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
said
that
the
secret
testimony
violated
his
rights?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
then
we
remanded?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
that
issue
was
still
in
the
case
and
it
might
be
a
ground
for
damages?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
but
at
that
time,
if
his
only
interest
was
in
the
damages,
how
could
he
have
gotten
any
benefit
out
of
just
the
fact
that
the
court
of
appeals
had
made
this
declaration?
justice
byron
r.
white
do
you
have
to
get
to
the
catalyst
argument?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
why
isn't
the
answer
to
that,
that...
supposing
there
hadn't
been
a
damages
claim
in
the
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
wouldn't
the
case
have
been
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
whether
or
not
the
vindication
of
your
constitutional
rights
as
a
personal
injury,
it
would
have
been
moot,
the
case
would
have
been
over?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
only
because
the
damages
were
still
alive,
but
aside
from
the
damages,
the
declaratory
judgment
phase
was
really
a
dead
issue.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
suppose
here
the...
suppose
we
just
took
the
bull
by
the
horns
which
sometimes
we
do,
and
said,
well,
it
may
be
true
the
court
of
appeals
said
this
or
that
but
there's
enough
facts
in
the
record
for
us
to
declare
that
this
defendant
is
immune.
suppose
we
had
said
that.
do
you
suppose
you
could
have
gotten
attorney's
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose
at
this
court
we
said
that
the
damages
claim
is
dead
now
because
we
say
the
defendant
was
immune.
justice
byron
r.
white
right
here
in
this
court,
when
it
was
first
here,
when
hewitt
against
helms
was
first
here,
we
said
the
defendant
is
immune
so
the
damages
claim
is
no
longer
alive.
do
you
think
you
could
have
gotten
attorney's
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
because?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
are
out
of
jail
and
absent
a
damages
claim
it
would
have
been
moot.
justice
byron
r.
white
the
case
is
dismissed
in
the
district
court
and
the
plaintiff
appeals
his
1983
loss
to
the
court
of
appeals,
and
then
while
it's
pending
in
the
court
of
appeals
he
is
released
from
prison,
and
all
he
ever
asked
for,
let's
assume,
is
a
declaratory
judgment
in
the
district
court.
that
is
all
he
ever
asked
for.
he
is
then
released
while
this
case
is
pending
on
appeal.
now,
you
have
at
least
twice,
earlier
in
your
argument,
said
the
case
would
have
become
moot
if
all
it
was
was
a
declaratory
judgment
request.
do
you
think
it
would
not
be
moot
now?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
if
it
passes
on
it
and
says,
you
don't
get
your
declaratory
judgment
and
you
appeal,
but
then
your
client
is
released?
justice
byron
r.
white
doesn't
it
become
moot?
justice
byron
r.
white
suppose...
the
new
regulations
were
the
result
of
his
lawsuit?
would
you
think
then
that
his
release
from
prison...
say
he
was
released
from
prison
the
same
day
that
they
adopted
the
new
regulations
so
that
he
himself
could
never
have
gotten
any
particular
benefit
out
of
the
new
regs.
now,
i
take
it
that
it's
your
position,
is
it,
that
he's
not
entitled
to
attorneys'
fees,
even
though
it's
clear
that
there's
a
connection
between
his
suit
and
the
new
regs?
justice
byron
r.
white
i
know
you
don't
want
to
accept
part
of
my--
justice
byron
r.
white
--all
right.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
still
haven't
answered
my
question.
he
is
released
from
prison
the
day
the
new
regs
go
in
so
he
can,
himself,
never
get
any
personal
benefit.
i
thought
part
of
your
theory
was,
at
least
the
government's,
that
unless
he
himself
is
going
to
get
a
benefit
from
the
result
of
his
case
he
isn't
entitled
to
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
so,
even
if
he
was
the
cause
of
the
new
regulations
he
gets
no
attorney's
fee
if
he
is
released...
if
he
is
released
prior
to
the
adoption
of
the
regs,
or
at
the
same
time?
justice
byron
r.
white
thank
you.
