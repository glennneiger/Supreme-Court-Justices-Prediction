mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
issue
in
this
case,
simply
stated,
is
whether
a
civil
rights
claimant
who
wins
nothing
in
the
course
of
his
lawsuit
is
entitled
to
attorney's
fees.
the
answer
simply
is
no.
the
facts
of
this
case
are
as
follows,
your
honors.
aaron
helms,
a
state
prisoner,
was
found
guilty
of
prison
misconduct
as
a
result
of
his
involvement
in
a
prison
riot.
in
a
section
1983
action
brought
against
state
corrections
officials,
helms
challenged
this
finding
of
guilt
which
had
been
based
on
information
supplied
by
a
confidential
informant
on
due
process
grounds.
helms
sought
equitable
relief
and
money
damages.
while
the
action
was
pending
in
the
district
court,
helms
was
paroled
from
prison.
the
district
court
entered
summary
judgment
for
the
state
officials
and
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
reversed.
the
circuit
court
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
to
determine
the
issue
of
petitioner's
claim
of
official
immunity,
and
also
to
determine
the
appropriateness
and
availability
of
the
relief
requested
by
helms.
on
remand
helms
abandoned
any
claims
other
than
his
request
for
damages.
the
district
court
granted
judgement
for
the
officials,
finding
them
to
be
immune
from
liability
for
damages,
and
the
court
of
appeals
affirmed.
helms
then
petitioned
for
attorney's
fees
which
the
district
court
denied,
finding
that
helms
had
not
prevailed
in
this
litigation.
the
court
of
appeals
reversed
and
awarded
fees,
concluding
that
its
statement
of
the
law
on
prison
informants
in
its
first
opinion
was
sufficient
to
qualify
helms
as
a
prevailing
party
under
the
civil
rights
attorney's
fees
awards
act.
in
addition,
the
court
of
appeals
directed
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
helms'
suit
was
a
catalyst
for
a
state
regulation
addressing
the
use
of
informant
testimony
which
was
passed,
or
promulgated
after
judgment
had
been
entered
for
the
officials.
there
are
two
major
reasons,
your
honors,
why
a
plaintiff
like
helms
should
not
be
entitled
to
attorney's
fees.
first
of
all,
to
award
attorney's
fees
to
a
claimant
who
has
obtained
no
personal
benefit
or
no
actual
relief
as
a
result
of
his
suit
would
violate
both
the
plain
meaning
of
the
statute,
as
well
as
the
intent
of
congress.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
was
a
statement
of
the
law
by
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
on
that
point,
saying
that
the
use
of
the
informant
testimony
by
the
officials
under
the
facts
of
this
case
was
violative
of
mr.
helms'
due
process
rights.
no
judgment,
your
honor;
there
was
a
remand
at
that
time
to
the
court
of
appeals
to
consider--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--to
the
district
court,
i'm
sorry,
to
consider
petitioner's
claim
of
entitlement
to
immunity
based
on
the
statement
of
the
law
articulated
by
the
third
circuit.
it's
really
the
first
prong
of
the
two-prong
harlow
inquiry.
the
court
of
appeals
said
what
the
law
is
and
left
it
to
the
district
court
to
determine
whether
that
law
was
clearly
established.
also,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
on
remand--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--that
the
officials
were
immune.
that
was
the
only
issue
before
the
district
court
on
remand.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
on
remand,
your
honor,
the
court
of
appeals
instructed
the
district
court
to
enter
summary
judgment
for
helms
unless
it
found
the
officials
to
be
immune.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
and
it
also--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--that's
correct,
except
to
determine
whether
that
law
was
clearly
established
at
the
time
of
the--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--correct.
it
would
have
entered
summary
judgment
for
helms
and
determined
damages.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
not
even
close,
your
honor.
the
court
didn't
enter
judgment.
it
didn't
direct
the
district
court
to
enter
judgment.
it
told
the
district
court
on
remand
to
determine
the
appropriateness
and
the
availability
of
the
requested
relief.
it
expressed
no
opinion.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
on
the
damage
issue,
not
a
declaratory
judgment.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
you
have
to
determine
the
law
applicable
to
the
facts.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
right.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
favorable
decision
on
the
law,
a
far
cry
from
declaratory
judgment.
declaratory
judgment,
your
honor,
you
can
enter,
you
can
enforce,
you
can
execute
on
it,
you
can
appeal
from
it.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
to
convict
him
of
prison
misconduct,
your
honor,
based
on
his
involvement
in
a
prison
riot.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
correct.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
your
honor,
helms
had
asked
for
three
forms
of
relief.
he
asked
for
money
damages.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
he
asked
for
declaratory
judgment,
and
he
asked
for
an
injunction
enjoining
prison
officials
from
doing
certain
things,
but
also
to
expunge
his
record.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
he
never
got
an
injunction.
in
point
of
fact,
on
remand
to
the
district
court
after
the
third
circuit
had
stated
the
law,
helms
abandoned
his
claim
for
expungement
of
his
misconduct
charge.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
i
don't
know.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
i
think
that
is
a
fair
statement,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
no,
because
he
didn't
get
an
expungement.
he
didn't
get
the
injunction.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
there
wasn't
anything
close
to
an
expungement
order.
he
never
even
asked
for
one.
when
he
went
back
on
remand
to
the
district
court--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--i
don't...
a
statement
of
the
law--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--i
am
sorry.
if
i
said
that,
i
misstated
myself.
i
don't
know
that
the
law
articulated
by
the
third
circuit,
i
don't
know
that
it
would
follow
necessarily
from
the
third
circuit
statement
of
the
law
that
this
misconduct
charge
could
never
be
used
against
this
man.
what
i
meant
to
tell--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--that
is
correct.
you
appeal
from
judgments,
your
honor.
and
to
try
to
be
fully
responsive
to
your
question,
i
don't
think
there
was
any
collateral
consequences,
your
honor,
of
this
misconduct
charge.
i
don't
think
the
state
could
have
used
it
in
any
way
against
this
man.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
i
saw
a
reference
to
that
in
respondent's
brief,
your
honor.
we
did
check
in
anticipation
of
the
argument
and
found
out
that
in
point
of
fact
he
has
been
returned...
he
is
back
in
prison.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
he
is
back
in
prison,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
may
it
please
the
court,
justice
stevens
asked
a
question.
i
want
to
make
sure
that
i
was
clear
enough
on
the
chronology,
your
honor.
prisoner
helms
was
released
from
prison
shortly
after
he
filed
this
lawsuit.
you
had
asked
about
the
effect
of
this
misconduct
conviction.
so,
as
i
said,
he
was
out
of
the
prison
population.
it
wouldn't
have
affected
him,
this
misconduct
charge.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
that's
my
understanding,
but
he
was
reincarcerated
after
this
litigation
had
been
concluded,
even
the
fees
portion,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
your
honors,
if
you
accept
helms'
position,
it
is
going
to
encourage
of
necessity
litigation
beyond
the
point
where
the
results
have
any
effect
on
the
relief
available
to
the
parties.
appeals
are
going
to
be
taken
from
statements
of
the
law
merely
because
defendants
want
to
avoid
liability
for
attorneys'
fees.
or
conversely,
i
guess
you
could
say
because
attorneys
for
the
plaintiff
want
to
recover
fees
even
though
there
is
no
effect
on
the
relief
available
to
their
clients.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
well,
we
could
have
petitioned
for
certiorari.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
in
effect
it
couldn't
have
been
appealed.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
the
administrative
custody
issue.
i
think
that
the
arguments
that
i
have
made
are
particularly
relevant,
your
honors,
in
cases
involving
governmental
immunity,
which
is
based
on
the
sound
idea
that
government
officials
should
be
free
to
vigorously
pursue
their
duties
without
the
fear
of
monetary
awards,
whether
those
awards
take
the
form
of
damages
or
of
fees.
again,
at
least
in
some
instances
if
you
award
a
plaintiff
like
helms
attorney's
fees,
officials
are
going
to
be
litigating
statements
of
law
despite
their
entitlement
to
immunity
even
where
there
is
no
effect
on
the
relief
available
to
the
parties.
in
the
absence
of
liability
for
damages
and
in
the
absence
of
the
entry
of
any
other
relief,
a
government
official's
immunity
is
seriously
weakened
if
they
are
nonetheless
held
liable
for
attorney's
fees.
as
this
court
has
pointed
out,
as
recently
as
in
the
unanimous
decision
of
kentucky
versus
graham
a
liability
on
the
merits
and
responsibility
for
fees
go
hand
in
hand.
where
defendant
has
not
been
prevailed
against,
either
because
of
legal
immunity
or
on
the
merits,
section
1988
does
not
authorize
a
fee
award
against
that
defendant.
it
would
be
unfair
and
unjust
and
a
disservice
to
the
very
important
principle
of
qualified
immunity
to
permit
an
award
of
attorney's
fees
against
state
officials
who
are
found
not
liable
to
the
plaintiff.
we
urge
this
court
to
reverse
the
court
of
appeals.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
no,
your
honor.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
oh,
yes,
your
honor.
he
was
released
shortly
after
he
initiated
this
lawsuit.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
no,
your
honor,
because
his
claim
for
damages
was
still
clearly
alive.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
yes,
it
did,
your
honor.
he
claimed
damages
on
two
violations.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
was
it--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--that's
correct.
the
court
of
appeals,
your
honor,
had
remanded
the
case
to
the
district
court
but
in
the
meanwhile
this
court
granted
certiorari
to
review
the
court
of
appeals'
finding
of
the
law
on
the
administrative
custody
issue.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
briefly,
your
honor,
in
drafting
the
fee
statute
congress
struck
a
balance,
and
that
is
clear
from
the
legislative
history,
between
encouraging
civil
rights
suits
to
vindicate
rights,
on
the
one
hand,
and
fairness
to
the
defendants
that
have
to
pay
attorneys'
fees
on
the
other
hand.
congress
didn't
take
the
private
attorney
general
concept
to
its
logical
extreme
and
it
didn't
say
that
all
plaintiffs
who
bring
non-frivolous
claims
are
entitled
to
fees,
nor
did
it
say
the
plaintiffs
who
secure
a
favorable
legal
ruling
are
entitled
to
fees.
what
congress
did
say
is
that
in
order
to
receive
fees
you
need
to
prevail.
helms
didn't
prevail.
he
got
no
damages.
he
got
no
injunction
and
he
got
no
declaratory
judgment
or
declaratory
relief,
and
i
think
we
need
to
be
clear
that
what
he
got
from
the
third
circuit
court
of
appeals
was
not
relief.
the
court
said,
"we
therefore
leave
the
issue
of
official
immunity
to
the
district
court
on
remand.
"
but
it
also
said,
"further
proceedings
will
also
be
required
to
determine
the
appropriateness
and
the
availability
of
the
requested
relief.
"
in
other
words,
they
gave
him
no
relief.
they
didn't
come
close
to
giving
him
relief,
and
they
made
it
clear
that
if
the
man's
going
to
get
relief
on
his
claims
which
are
damages,
injunction
and
a
declaratory
judgment
that's
going
to
be
done
by
the
district
court.
you
also
need
to
understand,
your
honors,
that
shortly
after
helms
filed
his
suit
he
was
parole
from
prison.
that
is
the
fact.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
under
the
facts
of
this
case...
can
i
answer
that
in
two
parts,
please,
your
honor?
under
the
facts--
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
--i
will
answer
your
hypothetical
first.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
yes,
if
the
state
changes
its
practices
in
response
to
a
lawsuit
so
that
the
effect
of
that
change
or
cessation
is
to
moot
plaintiff's
claim,
i
think
plaintiff
is
a
prevailing
party
and
entitled
to
fees.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
that's
correct,
because
he
wouldn't
have
benefited
nor
would
have
any
party
who
he
represented,
your
honor.
the
only
benefit,
if
there
is
arguable
benefit,
would
be
if
non-parties
with
future
grievances...
and
congress
didn't
say,
we're
taking
the
private
attorney
general
concept
that
far.
mr.
thomas
g.
saylor,
jr.
correct,
your
honor.
