that's
always
the
case.
i
mean,
you're
saying
grasp
the
constitutional
issues
that
you're
likely
to
have
to
grasp
sooner
or
later.
that's
certainly
not...
that's
just
not
the
way
we
behaved
in
the
past,
anyway.
justice
antonin
scalia
since
we're
going
to
have
to
face
it
tomorrow,
we
may
as
well
face
it
today?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
suppose
it's
your
argument,
mr.
stabler,
but
i
just
put
my
vote
with
the
chief
justice's.
i
would
rather
hear
you
argue
the
other
point
first,
just
in
case
you
run
into--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
want
us
to
carry
over
the
affirmance
fee
into
federal
court.
why
shouldn't
we
carry
over
the
12
percent
into
federal
court,
too?
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
the
next
case?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
in
theory,
you
think
that's
just
as
supportable?
i
mean,
after
all,
there's
nothing
inconsistent
between
5.75
and
12.
12
is
just
something
on
top
of
it.
you
get
the
5.75
and
you
get
something
more.
justice
antonin
scalia
still,
interest
on
a
voluntary
loan
is
one
thing.
interest
on
an
involuntary
loan
is
something
else.
one
person
shouldn't
have
the
right
to
get
money
from
somebody
else
so
long
as
he
pays
the
going
rate
of
interest
if
the
other
person
doesn't
want
to
loan
it.
and
the
statute
here
simply
says,
if
you
owe
the
money
you
owe
it,
if
the
other
fellow
doesn't
want
to
lend
it
to
you
at
5.75
or
whatever
a
rate
is,
pay
ten
percent
if
you
keep
it.
it
seems
fair
to
me.
