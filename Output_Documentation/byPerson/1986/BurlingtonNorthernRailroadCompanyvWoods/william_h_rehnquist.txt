chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stabler,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you're
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
mr.
stabler--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--wouldn't
the
first
inquiry
in
point
of
logic
be
whether
or
not
a
federal
court
sitting
in
alabama
should
apply
this
alabama
rule
in
this
particular
proceeding,
which
arose
out
of
diversity
jurisdiction,
rather
than
whether
the
statute
is
unconstitutional?
that
doesn't
necessary
mean
you
would
have
to
argue
it
would
be
that
way.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
there
are
nine
members
of
the
court
and
i'm
sure
we
would
like
to
hear
argument
on
both
points,
and
by
all
means
take
your
choice.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
know,
i
think
you
have
a
hard
time,
going
back
to
the
result
that
the
court
reached
in
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan,
if
you
say
that
so
long
as
the
federal
rules
are
kind
of
internally
consistent
and
seem
to
deal
with
all
the
things
these
people
thought
about
there's
no
place
for
a
state
statute.
certainly
that's
not
the
approach
the
court
took
in
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
the
substantive
policy
was
to
discourage
strike
suits.
here
you
could
say
that
there
is
a
substantive
policy
in
alabama
to
discourage
delay
on
the
part
of
defendants
against
whom
a
judgment
has
been
rendered
and
who
supersede
the
judgment.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
i
thought
your
most
recent
argument
was
that
alabama
has
no
substantive
policy;
it's
just
a
point
of
appellate
procedure.
but
an
awful
lot
of
points
of
procedure
are
based
on
substantive
policy,
as
i
continue
to
think
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan
was.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
disagree
with
you,
as
i
guess
i've
made
myself
clear.
it
seems
to
me
it
is
very
definitely
based
on
a
policy
of
alabama
that
they
want
to
discourage
defendants
such
as
your
client,
against
whom
a
judgment
has
been
rendered
and
who
supersede
the
judgment,
penalize
them
for
delay.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
thought...
i
understood
you
to
say
there
is
no
substantive
policy
behind
the
alabama--
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
--well,
what
about
the
policy
i
mentioned.
do
you
think
that's
an
unreasonable
interpretation
to
put
on
the
alabama
rule,
that
it
was
passed
for
the
reason
i
suggested
in
a
question
a
moment
ago?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
you
can
say
the
same
thing
about
the
new
jersey
provision
in
cohen
against
beneficial
loan.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
stabler,
i
think
your
quote
from
rinaldi
against
yeager
on
page
16
of
your
brief
belies
that
contention.
the
quote
that
you
have
on
page
16
reads
this
way:
"the
court
has
never
held
that
the
states
are
required
to
establish
avenues
of
appellate
review,
but
it
is
not
fundamental.
"
--and
you
underscore
that
phrase...
"that
once
established
these
avenues
must
be
kept
free
of
unreasoned
distinction.
"
that
doesn't
say
that
the
right
of
appeal
is
a
fundamental
right.
it
says
it's
fundamental
that,
once
a
right
of
appeal
is
established,
it
must
be
kept
free
of
unreasoned
distinctions.
i
think
that's
quite
different.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
i
didn't
think
that
was
the
point
you
were
attempting
to
make.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
what
is
the
point?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
that
doesn't
respond
at
all,
i
don't
think,
to
my
question.
do
you
agree
that
the
right
to
appeal
is
not
fundamental,
but
is
only
subject
to
a
test
for
unreasoned
distinctions?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
certainly
rinaldi
does
not
support
your
statement
at
all.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
xxx
did
you
think
was
left
after
our
opinion
in
united
states
against
crass?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
stabler.
we'll
hear
next
from
you,
mr.
haley.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
can
one
get
a
stay
as
a
matter
of
right
from
an
injunction
in
alabama,
the
same
way
one
can
get
a
stay
as
a
matter
of
right
by
posting
a
bond
and
superseding
a
money
judgment?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
haley.
mr.
stabler,
do
you
have
something
more?
you
have
eight
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
your
time
has
expired,
mr.
stabler.
the
case
is
submitted.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
opinions
of
the
court
in
no.
