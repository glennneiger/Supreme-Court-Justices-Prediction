mr.
haley,
may
i
interrupt
you
right
there
for
a
moment.
do
you
think
alabama
could
say
to
the
federal
judicial
system,
you
must
provide
for
stays
of
judgments,
or
do
you
think
the
federal
rules
could
decide,
we
won't
authorize
stays,
just
as
we
have
a
different
interest
rate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
that
if
the
federal
judicial
system
did
not
itself
authorize
stays
and
it
doesn't
authorize
supersedeas
in
quite
the
same
way
that
alabama
does,
then
there
would
be
no
basis
for
a
ten
percent
penalty,
even
though
there
were
appeals
and
unsuccessful
appeals?
it's
the
ten
percent,
as
i
understand
it,
and
as
you
say
in
your
own
brief,
it's
compensation
for
the
stay
of
execution.
but
that's
something
that's
granted
by
the
federal
court,
rather
than
the
state
court.
and
therefore...
and
then
just
so
you
get
my
thought
fully
in
mind,
if
the
federal
court
doesn't
have
to
grant
the
stay
in
the
first
place,
why
does
it
have
to
grant
the
particular
kind
of
stay
that
alabama
does,
namely
one
that
carries
a
ten
percent
penalty
with
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
and
you
got
a
stay.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
would
it
be
unconstitutional
for
the
state
to
have
a
statute
that
says
you
must
pay
your
judgment
unless
you
get
a
bond
to
secure
the
judgment,
instead
of
a
supersedeas,
and
the
bond
premium
shall
always
be
ten
percent
of
the
amount
of
the
judgment
and
then
it's
nonrecoverable?
would
that
be
unconstitutional?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it's
like
a
bail
bond.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
you
know,
the
ten
percent
is
a
fairly
customary
figure,
i
guess,
with
bail
bonds,
isn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
my
practice
was
more
diverse
than
yours.
[laughter]
you
meant
for
yourself.
