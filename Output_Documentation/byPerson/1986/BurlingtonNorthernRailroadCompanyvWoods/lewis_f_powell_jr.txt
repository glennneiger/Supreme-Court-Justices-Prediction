justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
ask
this
question?
was
that
a
substantive
due
process
decision
by
justice
holmes?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
was
it
a
due
process
decision?
it
was
not
equal
protection,
was
it?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
he
doesn't
mention
equal
protection?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
then
i
suggest
it
may
have
been
decided
on
the
basis
of
substantive
due
process,
that
had
not
been
rejected
in
1916
to
the
extent
that
we
are
now
very
careful
about
applying
it.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
mr.
haley,
may
i
ask
this
question.
if
the
plaintiff
in
this
case,
for
example,
had
lost
and
believed
that
the
district
court
had
given
erroneous
instructions,
he
could
have
appealed
under
the
alabama
law,
couldn't
he?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
but
that
plaintiff
also
would
have
had
his
day
in
court,
and
you
seem
to
be
arguing
that
if
one
has
a
day
in
court
at
the
trial
level
that
that's
all
that's
necessary.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
right,
so
that
both
sides
may
appeal,
but
a
losing
defendant
pays
a
penalty
if
his
appeal
is
not
successful?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
suppose
the
supreme
court
of
alabama
had
decided
this
case
four
to
three.
no
one
would
have
suggested
that
the
appeal
lacked
merit.
it
didn't
lack
enough
merit.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
i
was
wondering
whether
you--
