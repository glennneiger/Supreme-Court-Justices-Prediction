it
was
a
money
judgment,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
equal
protection
issue
in
this
case?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
non-money
judgments?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
neither
one
of
them
put
a
ten
percent
charge
on
for
losing.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
do
they
say?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
i
sue
to
prevent
my
neighbor
from
keeping...
trespassing
on
my
property,
and
i
lose
and
i
appeal
and
i
lose?
do
i
have
to
pay
ten
percent?
of
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
but
the
loser
in
an
ordinary
injunction
suit
appeal
doesn't
pay
any
penalty?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that
may
be
so,
but
he
hasn't
got...
he
doesn't
have
to
do
anything
more
than
to
satisfy
the
supersedeas
requirements.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
you
could
just
say
there
will
be
a
penalty.
justice
byron
r.
white
a
penalty
could
just
be
provided
for
taking
what
might
be
considered
a
frivolous
appeal.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
is
this
case
really
much
different
from,
say,
a
provision
that
the
loser
on
appeal
has
to
pay
the
other
side's
attorneys
fees?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
at
least
that's
one
of
the
hazards
you
have
to,
an
appellant
has
to
watch
out
for.
if
he
loses
on
appeal,
he's
going
to
have
to
pay
the
other
guy's
attorney's
fees.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
the
substantive
policy
might
be
we
want
to
discourage
frivolous
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
that's
a
different
case.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
agree
with
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
why
the
identity
of
the
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
the
identity
of
the
parties?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
you
lose.
