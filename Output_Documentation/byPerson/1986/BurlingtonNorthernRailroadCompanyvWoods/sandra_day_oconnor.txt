mr.
stabler,
technically
i
suppose
this
affirmance
penalty
of
alabama
is
not
a
direct
burden
on
the
right
to
appeal,
but
rather
a
burden
on
obtaining
a
stay
on
a
judgment
pending
appeal,
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
do
you
think
that
the
statute
calls
for
anything
more
than
a
rational
basis
test?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
you've
made
an
equal
protection
challenge
and
i
assume
that
in
most
instances
the
court
has
to
apply
some
kind
of
test
to
evaluate
an
equal
protection
challenge.
and
unless
there
is
some
heightened
standard
for
review,
the
court
would
normally
apply
a
rational
basis
test.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
purpose
of
the
penalty
is
to
discourage
frivolous
appeals,
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
why
you
think
that
wouldn't
conflict
with
rule
38
of
the
federal
appellate
rules.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
if
the
purpose
is
also
to
compensate
for
delay
in
obtaining
the
judgment,
then
it
serves
as
some
kind
of
a
supplement
to
post-judgment
interest
in
that
regard,
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
yes,
and
so
this
penalty
is
a
supplement
to
that
in
effect.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
that
right?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
then
why
wouldn't
it
conflict
with
appellate,
federal
appellate
procedure
rule
37(n),
section
1961
of
title
28
combined?
