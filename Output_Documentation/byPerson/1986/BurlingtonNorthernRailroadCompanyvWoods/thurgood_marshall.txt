burlington
northern
railroad
company
versus
woods
case,
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
awarded
respondent
as
successor
appellees.
10%
additional
damages
pursuant
to
alabama's
affirmance
penalty
statute.
we
hold
that
this
statute
conflicts
with
rule
38
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure,
and
therefore
has
no
application
to
judgment
entered
by
a
federal

sitting
in
diversity
cases.
we
thefore
reverse
the
judgment
below.
