mr.
james
o.
haley
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
i
will
address
first
the
alleged
conflict
between
the
alabama
affirmance
fee
and
rule
38
of
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
as
i
understand
what
mr.
stabler's
been
saying
is
that
it
must
be
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
rule
and
the
statute.
of
course,
we
recognize
that
the
federal
courts
have
rulemaking
power.
we
never
have
questioned
that.
we
never
have
questioned
the
fact,
and
i
don't
think
he
has,
that
the
legislature
of
alabama
has
legislative
power.
but
does
our
affirmance
fee
conflict
irreconcilably
with
the
federal
rules?
we
say
it
does
not,
for
several
reasons.
the
first
is,
the
federal
rules
do
not
have
any
provision
awarding
any
affirmance
fee
for
an
unsuccessful
appeal.
now,
there
is
a
difference
between
an
unsuccessful
appeal
and
an
appeal
taken
for
the
purpose
of
delay
or
frivolously.
we're
not
talking
about
the
delay
appeals
necessarily,
although
that
is
one
of
the
functions
of
the
affirmance
fee,
is
to
prevent
delay
appeals.
our
supreme
court
has
so
held.
but
it
goes
further,
and
there
is
a
reason
that
there
is
no
conflict,
one
of
the
reasons,
between
the
alabama
affirmance
fee
and
rule
38.
rule
38,
just
the
rule
does
not
go
as
far
as
the
affirmance
fee
does.
mr.
james
o.
haley
to
that
limited
extent,
it
might,
to
that
limited
extent.
but
our
statute
is
broader
than
that.
mr.
james
o.
haley
no,
ma'am,
it
does
not,
because
we
do
have
a
provision
for
post-judgment
interest.
mr.
james
o.
haley
right.
our
supreme
court
has
said
that
one
of--
mr.
james
o.
haley
--the
purposes
of
it
is
to
give
to
a
winning
plaintiff
some
additional
compensation.
that's
one
of
the
reasons
it's
been
assigned.
mr.
james
o.
haley
i
don't
believe
that
the
federal
rules
have
preempted
completely
the
state
affirmance
fee.
if
we
go
back
to
erie,
we
find
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
procedural
versus
substantive
provisions
is
to
discourage
forum
shopping.
now,
i
might
mention
this
at
this
time,
because
in
their
brief,
both
in
amicus
curiae
brief
and
in
the
appellant's
brief,
they
have
referred
to
the
fact
that
this
is
a
windfall
for
the
plaintiff.
in
our
brief
we
attempted
to
show
that
there
was
not
in
fact
any
windfall.
now,
under
the
federal
rules,
even
though
they
hold
against
the
appealing
defendant,
the
interest
rate
is
not
the
12
percent
that
they
have
been
talking
about
all
the
time.
you
do
not
get
12
percent
in
the
federal
courts.
today,
if
an
appeal...
if
a
judgment
is
rendered
in
a
federal
court,
the
interest
rates,
the
post-interest
rates
on
that
judgment
is
5.75
percent,
5.75
percent,
instead
of
the
12
percent
that
they're
talking
about.
well,
the
interest
rates
in
the
state
court...
and
we're
getting
to
the
question
now
as
to
whether
or
not
the
federal
rule...
i
mean,
the
federal
courts
should
enforce
the
alabama
affirmance
fee.
if
a
citizen
of
alabama
files
a
suit
against
an
alabama
corporation
or
citizen
of
alabama
and
wins
the
case
and
the
case
is
appealed,
then
he
gets
12
percent
interest
and
10
percent
affirmance
fee.
that
may
look
like
a
windfall,
but
i
think
our
brief
shows
it's
really
not.
mr.
james
o.
haley
well,
we
did
not
ask
for
that,
your
honor.
that's
all
the
reason.
mr.
james
o.
haley
well,
not
from
us,
no.
we've
never
thought
about
it,
to
be
honest
with
you.
mr.
james
o.
haley
you
can
look
at
my
hair
and
see
that
this
is
not
the
first
time
that
i've
ever
stood
before
a
court,
but
i'll
have
to
admit
that
you
threw
one
at
me
that
i
haven't
thought
about.
and
when
i
try
to
answer
something
off
the
top
of
my
head,
i
usually
find
that
i
have
to
eat
my
words
later.
no,
in
answer
to
your
question,
since
you
have
brought
it
up,
i
don't
see
that
there
is
any
difference.
really,
i
don't
see
that
offhand
there
is.
but
again,
we
have
never
asked
for
it.
we
have
always
asked...
you
know,
that
brings
us,
i
think,
to
the
real
crux
of
this
whole
thing,
and
that
is
that...
and
there's
one
statement
in
one
of
the
cases
here,
i
think
justice
powell
wrote
it,
where
he
says
that,
of
some
100
rules,
every
one
of
them
is
written
for
some
purpose,
and
just
about
every
rule
and
every
statute
that
we
have
in
alabama
or
anywhere
else
pertaining
to
litigation,
tort
litigation
or
contract
litigation
or
what-not,
it
favors
to
some
extent
a
plaintiff
or
a
defendant.
right
now
we
know
that
we've
got
invoked
all
over
this
country...
today
in
alabama
we
are
having
an
election
of
a
governor,
which
you
all
know
about,
and
one
of
the
hottest
issues
in
this
election
is
tort
reform.
and
when
the
election
is
over,
regardless
of
who
wins,
there's
going
to
be
a
lot
of
tort
reform
bills
introduced
in
the
legislature,
attempting
to
give
the
plaintiff
some
advantages
in
some
instances
and
the
defendant
some
advantages
in
some
instances.
so
you
have
to
mesh
them
all
together
and
do
what
vastine
said,
come
up
with
what's
just
and
right.
well,
what's
just
and
right
in
requiring
a
defendant
who
has
had
his
day
in
court,
has
been
unsuccessful
in
his
motion
to
dismiss
or
his
motion
for
summary
judgment,
directed
verdict,
the
jury
has
found
against
him,
been
unsuccessful
in
his
motion
for
a
new
trial,
unsuccessful
on
his
motion
for
a
judgment
nov...
the
plaintiff
now
has
a
judgment.
they
don't
stand
in
the
relationship
of
plaintiff
and
defendant
any
more.
now
they
stand
in
the
position
of
debtor
and
creditor.
and
who
can
ever
say
that
it's
wrong
to
require
a
debtor
to
pay
if
he
doesn't
turn
over
the
money?
now,
that's
what
we're
here
on.
the
judgment
has
been
rendered,
it's
final.
everything
has
been
done
except
the
possibility
of
reversal
on
appeal.
alabama
law
says,
well,
here
you
are,
you've
got
a
judgment
rendered
against
you;
we're
going
to
give
you
your
option.
we're
going
to
let
you
make
the
decision,
what
you
want
to
do.
you
can
pay
it,
you
can
appeal
it
without
a
supersedeas,
or
you
can
supersede
it,
and
if
you
are
unsuccessful
then
you're
going
to
have
to
pay
the
ten
percent
penalty.
mr.
james
o.
haley
justice,
i
would
never
say
that
alabama
can
tell
a
federal
court
what
it's
got
to
do,
no,
sir.
i
don't
think
so,
in
answer
to
your
question.
mr.
james
o.
haley
well,
i
will
readily
admit
that
their
position
is
much
stronger
on
that
issue
than
on
the
due
process
issue.
i
would
admit
that.
and
what
i
can
say
to
you
is
is
what
the
status
of
the
cases
at
this
time
is.
the
fifth
circuit,
before
there
was
a
division
between
the
fifth
and
the
eleventh,
in
two
cases
upheld
the
alabama
affirmance
fee
in
diversity
cases.
later,
they
did
in
a
mississippi
case,
that
went
up
from
mississippi,
hold
that
there
was
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
mississippi
statute
and
the
alabama
and
the
federal
rule.
they
held
that,
and
by
so
doing
they
stated
that
they
were
not
applying
the
fifth
circuit's
alabama
affirmance
fee
any
more.
but
the
eleventh
circuit
had
held
prior
to
that
that
the
alabama
affirmance
fee
was
not
in
conflict
with
the
rules
and
was
not
unconstitutional.
and
then
after...
it
was
the
affholder
case
that's
referred
to
in
both
briefs...
the
fifth
circuit's
ruling,
then
the
eleventh
circuit
was
asked
to
reconsider
its
previous
holdings,
because
the
eleventh
circuit
had
changed
its
ruling
on
it.
and
that
was
the
case
of
jackson
versus
magnolia
brokerage
company,
and
then
there
was
our
case.
and
they
asked...
the
eleventh
circuit
then,
a
panel,
adhering
to
their
former
rule,
as
they
are
required
to
do,
refused
to
overrule
their
former
position.
and
then
a
petition
for
an
en
banc
reconsideration
was
filed,
and
it
was
overruled.
and
that
case
came
to
this
court
by
writ
of...
a
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
which
was
denied.
but
in
the
petition
for
a
writ
of
certiorari,
they
based
their
contentions
solely
on
the
fact
that
there
was
an
irreconcilable
conflict
between
the
rule,
the
federal
rule,
and
the
affirmance
fee
statute.
i
have
made
a
list
of
some
of
the
things
here
that
i
think
justify
a
distinction
between
the...
i
mean,
reasons
why
both
rules
can
be
held
applicable.
in
the
first
place,
our
rule,
our
affirmance
fee,
is
mandatory.
rule
38
and
affirmance
the
statute
have
different
fields
of
operation.
alabama
in
mcannally
versus
levco
held
directly
that...
and
we
do
have
a
rule
38
that's
almost
identical
to
the
federal
rule
38,
and
in
this
case
of
mcannally
versus
levco,
inc.,
456
southern
2d
66,
our
court
held
that
there
was
a
field
of
operation
for
both
the
statute
and
the
rule,
and
applied
the
damages,
ten
percent,
and
then
applied
damages
for
the
wrongful
taking
of
the
delaying
tactics.
in
that
case,
what
they
did,
they
filed
an
appeal
and
just
never
did...
and
filed
a
supersedeas
bond,
but
never
even
prosecuted
the
appeal
at
all.
in
that
case,
our
court
held
that
they
were
liable
on
both
of
them.
if
there
are
no
more
questions
on
that,
i
will
get
to
what
i
consider
the
crux
of
the
case,
on
the
due
process.
now,
fortunately
we
have
a
supreme
court
case.
it's
an
old
case,
yes,
but
this
statute's
old,
too.
this
statute
has
been
in
force
in
alabama
for
166
years.
i
haven't
been
around
166
years.
i've
been
around
a
long
time.
but
i
cannot
find
any
record
anywhere
that
any
supreme
court
justice
has
ever
held
or
said
that
there
was
no
reason
for
not
applying
the
affirmance
fee
statute.
in
that
period
of
time,
of
course,
we've
had
many
legislative
sessions
to
meet,
and
to
my
knowledge
no
legislature
as
yet...
maybe
tomorrow
after
the
election,
but
so
far
i
don't
think
any
legislative
proposal
has
ever
been
made
to
change
it.
well,
that's
got
to
indicate
something.
it
must
indicate
that
it
works
pretty
good
to
me.
i
know
that
you
can't
get
grandfathered
constitutional
rights,
but
if
it's
been
working
to
the
satisfaction
of
the
people
of
alabama
for
166
years
it
sounds
pretty
good.
but
justice
holmes
decided
this
issue,
your
honors,
in
1916
in
an
identical
case
from
the
state
of
kentucky,
on
almost
an
identical
statute,
now,
they
have
said
in
their
brief,
and
they
didn't
argue
it...
they
have
said
in
their
brief
that
justice
holmes
did
not
really
base
it
on
a
constitutional
question.
but
yet,
in
their
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
at
page
9
in
a
footnote
they
say
this:
"the
supreme
court
many
years
ago
held
that
the
imposition
of
a
penalty
for
filing
a
supersedeas
bond
does
not
violate
due
process
principles.
"
"louisville
&
nashville
railroad
versus
stewart.
"
and
then
they
say
this
further:
"we
contend
that
modern
principles
of
due
process,
discussed
infra,
called
into
question
the
continued
validity
of
stewart.
"
what
he
said
in
his
petition
was
that
it's
been
decided
against
him
in
stewart,
but
this
court's
going
to
have
to
overrule
stewart
in
order
to
rule
in
his
favor.
well,
stewart...
i
don't
know
what
justice
holmes
decided,
really
had
in
mind,
what
was
before
him.
but
i
do
know
this:
in
the
syllabus...
and
i
realize
what
the
function
of
a
syllabus
is,
but
this
is
a
1916
case.
the
syllabus
of
the
case
says:
"due
process
provision
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
does
not
require
a
state
to
provide
for
suspension
of
judgments
pending
appeal,
nor
preventing
its
making
it
costly
in
case
a
judgment
is
upheld,
nor
is
due
process
denied
by
adding
ten
percent,
as
is
done
under
the
statute
of
kentucky,
on
the
amount
of
judgment
if
the
same
is
affirmed.
"
and
in
this
case,
he
affirmed
both
the
ten
percent
penalty
and
the
interest
provided
by
the
law
of
kentucky.
and
in
his
opinion
he
discussed
one
or
two
matters,
and
then
he
said:
"the
first
of
the
other
objections
is
that
the
court
of
appeals
was
not
authorized
to
add
ten
percent
damages
on
the
amount
of
the
judgment
as
it
did.
"
"but
the
railroad
company
obtained
a
supersedeas
and
the
law
of
the
state
makes
ten
percent
the
cost
of
it
to
all
persons
if
the
judgment
is
affirmed.
"
"there
was
no
obligation
upon
the
state
to
provide
for
a
suspension
of
the
judgment
and
nothing
to
prevent
its
making
it
costly
in
cases
where
ultimately
the
judgment
is
upheld.
"
mr.
james
o.
haley
your
honor?
mr.
james
o.
haley
he
doesn't
say.
mr.
james
o.
haley
he
does
not.
mr.
james
o.
haley
well,
i
realize
that,
but
this
has
never...
our
supreme
court
has
relied
on
it.
we
cited
a
case
where
our
supreme
court
relied
on
it
on
a
due
process
challenge.
mr.
stabler
considered
it
a
due
process
decision
when
he
filed
his
petition.
i'm
sort
of
reluctant
to
argue
some
of
these
deep
questions
here
before
a
court
that
decides
them
every
day
and
you
wrote
the
opinions
and
you
know
them.
but
as
i
read
them
and
as
i
read
this
one...
it
even
antedates
me.
but
you
can
read
it
better
than
i
can,
that's
what
it
is.
that's
what
it
is.
mr.
james
o.
haley
yes,
it
was
a
money
judgment.
it
was
a
money
judgment
in
an
fela
case.
i
think
what
vastine
really
contends
is
that
the
contention
probably
was...
it's
not
in
the
opinion
and
it's
not
in
the
syllabus...
that,
the
fela
being
a
federal
statute,
the
state
could
not
change
the
measure
of
damages
by
imposing
a
ten
percent
penalty.
if
that's
what
their
contention
was,
it
ruled
against
them
on
that,
too.
that's
the
only
two
constitutional
grounds,
and
i
don't
think
that
that
would
be
constitutional.
i
think
it
would
be
inapplicable
to
the
particular
type
of
case.
mr.
james
o.
haley
the
equal
protection
issue
is
that
this
applies
to
every
defendant
against
whom
a
money
judgment
is
obtained.
it
makes
no
discrimination
as
between
the
types
of
defendants.
it
applies
to
rich
and
to
poor,
to
corporate,
to
individuals,
to
residents
and
to
foreign
corporations.
it
applies
to
everybody.
i
do
not
see
any
discrimination.
i
cannot
see
any
discrimination.
mr.
james
o.
haley
well,
we've
got
two
other
statutes
that
bring
that
into
play,
your
honor.
one
is--
mr.
james
o.
haley
--yes,
sir,
they
do.
yes,
sir,
they
do.
mr.
james
o.
haley
we've
got
one
that
provides
a
ten
percent
penalty
if
you...
it's
a
different
statute...
if
you
are
sued
for
possession
of
real
property
and
lose
and
you
keep
it
over,
sort
of
like
your
lindsey
case.
mr.
james
o.
haley
and
the
other
is
that
if
you
are
sued
for
personal
property
and
you
don't
surrender
it
and
take
your
chances
on
appeal,
it
does...
you're
talking
about
does
it...
well,
there
are--
mr.
james
o.
haley
--well,
if
you
appeal
that
would
be
an
injunction
proceeding,
of
course.
mr.
james
o.
haley
but
he
has
to
give
a
bond
to
indemnify
the
other
party
against
damages.
mr.
james
o.
haley
that's
right,
and
i
cannot
conceive
how
your
damages
could
be
determined
in
an
injunction.
mr.
james
o.
haley
sir?
mr.
james
o.
haley
well,
it
would
have
no
relationship
whatsoever
to
the
damages
involved,
if
it
did.
mr.
james
o.
haley
no,
you
cannot,
you
cannot.
you
can
get
a
stay
only
by
making
an
application
for
it,
and
if
it's
granted
then
the
judge
sets
the
amount
of
the
bond
that
he's
got
to
give
in
order
to
obtain
the
stay.
it
can
be
obtained
that
way
and
only
that
way.
i
think
the
most
analogous
situation
that
we
have
is
the
rule
68,
the
offer
of
judgment
rule.
now,
this
court
has
had
two
cases,
important
cases
which
have
been
thoroughly
discussed,
on
the
offer
of
judgment
rule.
i
think
that's
almost
an
analogous
situation.
it
places...
that
rule
places
upon
the
plaintiff
the
burden
of
making
the
decision
as
to
whether
or
not
he
is
going
to
go
forward
with
the
lawsuit,
because
under
that
rule
the
defendant
can
at
any
time
not
less
than
ten
days
prior
to
trial
date
make
an
offer
of
judgment.
and
the
plaintiff,
at
that
time
he
hasn't
tried
his
case.
he
probably
hasn't
even
finished
his
discovery.
but
yet
he's
got
to
within
ten
days
decide
whether
or
not
he's
going
to
settle
that
case
for
the
amount
of
the
offer.
and
if
he
doesn't
do
it,
then
he's
subjected
to
all
costs
incurred
by
the
defendant
after
that
offer
is
made.
in
this
case,
the
defendant
has
already
had
his
day
in
court.
he's
had
due
process,
sure.
he
has
had
due
process
and
he's
had
his
day
in
court
and
he's
lost.
so
he
is
confronted
with
the
same
proposition.
the
plaintiff
now
is
saying
to
him:
you
pay
the
judgment
or
suffer
the
ten
percent
affirmance
fee
penalty.
i
see
no
difference.
and
this
court
has
said
in
as
strong
language
as
you
possibly
could
say
it
that
one
of
the
main
purposes
of
the
offer
of
judgment
rule
is
to
encourage
settlements
and
to
discourage
protracted
litigation,
bring
it
to
an
end.
mr.
james
o.
haley
yes,
you
can
appeal
from
a
ruling
on
a
motion.
mr.
james
o.
haley
a
ruling
on
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
mr.
james
o.
haley
no,
sir,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that.
no,
sir,
i
didn't
mean
to
say
that
at
all.
if
i
gave
that
impression,
it's
wrong.
i
have
never
said
that
they
don't
have
a
right
to
appeal.
i
don't
think
it's
a
fundamental
right
to
appeal,
but
under
our
law
they
are
given
the
right
to
appeal.
but
when
they
are
given
a
right
that
fundamental
law
does
not
guarantee
to
them
so
far
as
constitutional
principles
are
concerned,
they
have
to
meet
the
requirements
of
the
law.
mr.
james
o.
haley
well--
mr.
james
o.
haley
--that's
right.
what
would
be--
mr.
james
o.
haley
--yes,
sir,
i
think
it's
fair,
yes,
sir.
i
think
it's
fair
because
where
is
the
incentive
for
a
losing
plaintiff
to
take
a
losing
appeal?
in
the
first
place,
he's
got
to
give
a
bond
to
make
the
appeal.
he's
got
to
buy
a
copy
of
the
record.
he's
got
to
employ
or
pay
an
attorney
to
take
the
appeal.
and
then
if
he
wins,
all
he's
done
is
he's
thrown
it
back
into
court
to
try
his
case.
and
if
he
loses
it,
it's
all
for
naught.
but
the
defendant
has
the
benefit.
if
the
defendant
loses
and
still
pays
the
penalty,
he
still
has
had
the
benefit
of
that
money
during
that
period
of
time.
now,
there's
where
the
quid
pro
quo
comes
into
play,
that
the
plaintiff...
the
defendant
has
got
a
quid
pro
quo.
they
are
keeping
the
money.
the
plaintiff
wants
it,
he
needs
it.
just
look
at
the
eleventh
circuit
case
in
here.
here
is
a
man
who
is
a
machinist.
according
to
the
eleventh
circuit's
opinion
which
i
referred
to,
he
was
permanently
disabled,
permanently
rendered
less
able
to
work
and
make
a
living.
he
had
had
two
operations.
he
needed
his
money
when
he
got
his
judgment.
now,
who
is
taking
advantage
of
whom?
the
defendant
comes
to
him
after
that,
and
we
know
what
happens.
you
know
it
happens,
too.
he
comes:
well,
you've
got
a
judgment
for
$300;
i
can
appeal
it.
i
need
my
money,
i
need
my
money.
well,
we're
going
to
appeal
it
unless
you
knock
off
something.
well,
say
they
don't
put
that
in
there,
but
they
most
likely
would.
who
has
got
the
upper
hand
on
those
dealings?
are
they
dealing
on
an
equal
basis?
no.
the
defendant
has
got
the
advantage
because
they
have
got
the
money
and
they
are
holding
it.
he's
needing
it.
he's
going
to
have
to
wait
for
it,
and
under
the
economic
conditions
that
we've
had
in
the
last
several
years.
