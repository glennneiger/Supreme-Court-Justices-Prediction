mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
do
not
believe
that
a
recitation
of
the
facts
is
important
in
this
case,
that
is
the
facts
with
respect
to
the
trial.
in
fact,
the
thrust
of
this
particular
petition
lies
on
the
premise
that
basically
the
facts
don't
matter.
by
that
i
mean
it
really
does
not
matter
whether
this
judgment
that
alan
and
cara
woods
obtained
was
based
on
impressive
theories
of
liability
and
damages
or
not.
it
really
does
not
matter
whether
the
rulings
of
judge
clemon
which
were
attacked
on
the
appeal
were
soundly
grounded
in
established
law
or
whether
they
were
based
upon
less
substantial
bases.
and
it
really
doesn't
matter
whether
our
appeal
was
substantial
or
frivolous.
this
petition
is
based
upon
the
application
of
an
alabama
statute
that
operates
automatically
in
every
case.
essentially,
there
are
three
conditions
for
the
application
of
the
ten
percent
fee:
first,
the
appeal
must
be
taken
by
a
defendant,
and
it's
the
defendant
in
a
case
involving
either
money
or
property.
second,
the
judgment
must
be
superseded.
i
suppose
a
better
word
is
stayed,
because
we
have
a
procedure
in
alabama
where
municipalities
can
stay
a
judgment
without
actually
putting
up
a
bond,
and
they
are
subject
to
this
ruling
just
as
much
as
private
parties
are
who
have
to
put
a
supersedeas
bond
up.
and
third,
it
has
to
be
affirmed.
the
affirmance
has
to
be
in
toto.
if
there
is
an
affirmance
by
modification
in
any
way,
then
the
affirmance
penalty
does
not
apply.
we
have
brought
this
petition
on
the
first
question
based
on
a
claim
that
this
statute
violates
both
the
equal
protection
clause
and
the
due
process
clause
of
the
fourteenth
amendment.
i
frankly
believe
that
each
of
them,
each
of
the
clauses,
is
applicable.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
yes.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
well,
i'm
arguing
the
other
way
to
try
and
induce
you
to
go
the
other
way,
your
honor.
and
if
i
could
explain
my
reasoning
as
to
why
i
believe
you
should
go
to
the
constitutional
question
first,
i'm
aware
of
the
rules
of
construction
regarding
constitutional
questions,
although
we
have
constitutional
questions
both
on
the
first
question
and
the
second
question.
but
this
rule
of
construction
is
grounded
on
a
policy
of
avoiding
deciding
questions
you
don't
have
to
decide.
now,
my
pitch
to
you,
so
to
speak,
is
that
if
you
go
to
the
question
of
federal-state
relations
first
and
if
i'm
fortunate
enough
to
win,
the
question
of
the
due
process
and
equal
protection
is
still
there.
you've
got
three
or
four
cases
in
the
hopper
right
now.
we
have
some
40
or
50
appeals,
by
our
count,
where
this
penalty
is
applied
in
alabama.
mississippi
has
a
similar
statute
and
i
assume
they
have
a
similar
number.
the
question--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--well,
your
honor,
there's
another
side
to
it--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--well,
there's
another
side
to
it,
too,
that
you
don't
have
to
reach
the
question
of
the
federal-state
relations
question
if
you
decide
the
constitutional
question.
that
is
to
say
that
if
you...
and
i'm
optimistic
enough
to
assume
that
i'm
right
on
both
questions.
if
you
decide
that
question,
you're
deciding
a
question
you
would
never
have
to
decide.
and
i'm
saying
that
a
mechanical
application
of
the
rule
really
runs
counter
to
the
policy
of
trying
to
decide
as
little
as
you
have
to
decide.
and
frankly,
i
would
hope
that
you
would
reach
the
question
of
due
process
and
equal
protection,
and
i
think
if
you
will
and
if
you
decide
it,
this
little
alabama
statute
will
be
gone
and
you
will
never
have
to
face
the
hanna
versus
plumer
question.
now--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--well,
i
certainly
want
to
do
what
you
want
me
to
do.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
well,
i
guess
i'll
take
the
coward's
way
out
and
follow
your
suggestion.
i
think
the
question
of
the
federal-state
relations
question
really
has
to
be
looked
at
analytically
two
ways:
first,
as
to
whether
it's
a
matter
that's
controlled
by
the
federal
rules,
in
which
case
it
comes
under
hanna
versus
plumer.
if
not,
then
we
have
to
dive
further
into
the
erie
policy
considerations
if
it's
not
controlled
by
the
federal
rules.
as
i
see
it...
and
we
made
a
note
of
this
in
our
reply
brief...
the
difference
between
the
parties
is
that
they
claim
that
there
must
be
a
direct
conflict
in
the
sense
that
there
must
be
a
word
to
be
found
in
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
or
a
sentence
which
specifically
prohibits
an
affirmance
penalty
for
there
to
be
a
conflict
between
the
state...
the
federal
appellate
procedure
and
the
state.
we
maintain
that
the
scope
of
the
rules
is
such
that
the
subject
matter
is
controlled.
i
think
the
words
that
we
lifted
from
hanna
versus
plumer
are
"the
situation
is
covered",
or
words
to
that
effect.
i
think
in
the
walker
case
there
was
a
reference
to
whether
it
is
within
the
scope
of
the
rules.
and
i
think
that
it
is
quite
clear
that
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
specifically
cover
really
all
of
the
rules
of
procedure.
i
think
it's
interesting--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--well,
i've
got
two
distinctions
from
what
you've
said,
your
honor.
the
first
is
i
think
there
is
a
very
definite
difference
between
the
rules
of
civil
procedure
and
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
we
noted
in
our
briefs
both
rule
1
and
the
comment
to
rule
1,
which
are
to
the
effect
that
the
federal
rules
of
appellate
procedure
are
controlling
with
respect
to
appellate
rules.
there
is
no
comparable
phrase
in
the
rules
of
civil
procedure.
if
i
may
use
the
analogy,
it's
a
little
like
a
contract
which
says,
this
is
the
entire
agreement
between
the
parties.
it
has
that
kind
of
provision.
i
think
the
nature
of
the
appellate
rules
are
that
they
are
contained,
while
there
is
much
more
interaction
in
civil
rules
with
state
substantive
rules
than
is
true
in
the
appellate
rules.
secondly,
though,
cohen
was
based
upon
a
solid
view
that
there
was
a
state
substantive
policy
that
was
being
recognized.
i
brought
to
you
perhaps
the
most
graphic
example
of
the
substantive
policy
of
the
code
of
alabama
or
the
alabama
legislature,
dealing
with
the
alabama
affirmance
penalty.
this
is
in
title
12,
which
deals
with
courts.
it
is
in
chapter
22,
which
deals
with
appellate
proceedings;
and
it
is
in
division
5,
which
deals
with
the
disposition
of
appeals.
now,
if
you
are
looking,
as
they
did
in
cohen,
for
a
state
policy
which
is
a
substantive
policy,
you
will
not
find
it.
this
code
is
adopted
by
the
alabama
legislature.
they
have
organized
this
particular
provision
to
come
within
a
section
of
the
code
which
serves
a
function
quite
the
same
as
the
function
of
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
that
is
quite
different
from
cohen.
i
was
reading
a
comment
by
justice
harlan
in
his
concurring
opinion
in
hanna
versus
plumer
where
he
says
at
the
end
of
the
opinion
that
anyone
practicing
law
at
that
time
was
aware
of
the
substantive
policies
tied
to
the
bonding
statutes
that
were
involved.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
your
honor,
i
don't
even
think
you
go
to
that
question
until
there
is
a
determination
of
the
scope
of
the
appellate
rules.
if
hanna
versus--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--i
agree
with
you.
i
was
responding
to
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan,
which
is
a
case
that
predates
hanna
versus
plumer.
but
i
believe
that
the
appropriate
analysis
in
this
particular
case
is
to
inquire
first
as
to
whether
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
are
applicable.
now,
you
use
the
federal
rule
to
set
the
amount
of
bond,
not
the
state
rule,
the
supersedeas
bond.
you
use
the
federal
rule,
not
the
state
rule,
to
control
the
interest
that
is
to
be
assessed.
you
use
the
federal
rule,
not
the
state
rule,
when
dealing
with
the
question
of
whether
there
is
a
frivolous
appeal
under
rule
38.
every
incident
of
this
appeal
is
controlled
by
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure.
and
i
submit
that
the
rules
of
appellate
procedure
are
in
scope
complete
and
designed
to
control
the
subject
matter
of
this
appeal.
now,
if
i'm
correct
in
that
submission,
hanna
versus
plumer
itself
recognizes
that
the
substantive
policies
of
the
state
are
not
necessarily
to
be
controlling.
now,
if
you
go
and
say,
well,
the
scope
of
the
rules
is
not
applicable,
then
we
do
look
to
the
state
policy.
but
there
is
no
state
policy
here.
cohen
versus
beneficial
loan
dealt
with
a
very
complicated
and
erudite
law,
corporate
law,
which
is
certainly
a
complicated
field
and
one
in
which
procedure
and
substantive
law
have
been
traditionally
mixed.
here,
all
you've
got
to
do
is
be
on
the
right
side
of
the
rule
when
the
verdict
comes
in
to
be
subject
to
this
particular
rule.
it
does
not
aid
or
abet
any
particular
substantive
rule
of
alabama.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
your
honor,
you're
leading
me
back
to
the
other
part,
i
believe.
i
don't
want
to
leave
it,
leave
the
due
process
feature
of
my
argument,
but
my
response
to
that
basically
is
that
it
is
a
policy
which
is
unconstitutionally
enforced.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
i
do
not
think
it
is
a
substantive
policy.
there
have
only
been
two
policies
stated
by
the
alabama
supreme
court.
one
has
to
do
with
whether
to
deter
frivolous
appeals.
that
clearly
is--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--your
honor,
i
don't
think
that
the
policy
as
you
have
stated
it
is
anything
more
than
a
policy
designed
to
protect
the
court
system.
it
is
not--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--well,
the
case
that
comes
to
my
mind,
to
respond
to
you,
your
honor,
is
the
gulf,
colorado
case,
which
we
cite,
in
which
it
was
determined
that
when
a
railroad,
bless
them,
was
sued
they
had
to
pay
attorney's
fees.
the
only
identification...
attorney's
fees
to
the
plaintiff.
the
only
identification...
it
had
nothing
to
do
with
the
substantive
dispute.
it
had
to
do
with
the
identify
of
parties.
and
i
submit
that
that's
true
here,
too,
that
it
is
not
in...
the
state
of
alabama
is
not
pursuing
any
substantive
policy
other
than
relating
itself
to
the
identity
of
parties.
and
i
submit
that
it's
a
violation
of
equal
protection
to
single
out
a
particular
group,
in
this
case
defendants
in
certain
classes
of
cases,
and
say
that,
if
you
exercise
the
rights
of
appeal,
the
right
of
supersedeas,
and
you
take
in
effect
the
access
to
a
court,
you
submit
yourself
to
a
penalty.
you
are
to
pay
a
price
for
the
access
to
the
process
of
courts.
to
my
way
of
thinking--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--well,
i
submit
that
the
two
can
only...
can
be
separated
no
more
than
a
steering
wheel
can
be
separated
from
a
car,
because
if
the
defendants
do
not
have
some
way
to
protect
their
litigated
property
in
the
event
that
they
win
it
is
a
right
that
is...
the
appeal
right
is
of
little
value.
so
i
would
submit
to
you
that
to
distinguish
them
is
more
a
matter
of
semantics
than
one
of
reality.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
i'm
not
sure
i
fully
understand
your
question.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
well,
we
submit
that...
and
we
base
it
upon
several
cases,
rinaldi
versus
yeager
being
the
first...
that
the
right
to
appeal
free
of
unreasoned
distinctions,
which
brings
equal
protection
into
it,
is
a
fundamental
right.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
that
was
a
point
i
was
attempting
to
make,
your
honor.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
no,
it
clearly
is
the
point.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
the
point
is
that
if
access
to
any
court...
and
i
don't
think
it
matters
whether
you
are
talking
about
the
police
court
or
you're
talking
about
the
circuit
court
or
to
an
appellate
court.
the
essence
of
both
due
process
and
equal
protection
is
that
the
scales
of
justice
must
stand
equal.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
i
think
that
the
right
to
an
appeal
free
of
unreasoned
distinctions,
that
is
a
right
to
a
fair
and
equal
access
to
an
appellate
court,
is
a
fundamental
right.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
your
honor,
well,
i
would
disagree
with
that.
north
carolina
versus
pearce
cites
rinaldi
and
i
believe
interprets
it
in
the
same
fashion
that
i
am
myself.
i
would
submit
to
the
court,
though
it
is
a
due
process
point,
boddie
versus
connecticut,
justice
harlan
makes
a
strong
and
eloquent
statement
in
that
case
about
the
place
in
society,
if
you
will,
of
allowing
access
to
courts,
allowing
evenhanded
justice.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
your
honor,
i'm
sorry,
i
don't
know.
i
have
not
read
the
case.
but
i
am
strong
of
the
view
that
the
integrity
of
the
court
system
depends
upon
equality
of
treatment,
and
equal
protection
principles
belong
in
the
courts
of
appeals
as
much
as
any
place
i
know,
because
if
you
do
not
have
the
principle
of
equality
in
the
courts
you've
basically
destroyed
the
essence
of
what
they're
all
about.
i'm
going
to
reserve
the
rest
of
the
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
yes,
your
honor,
i
do.
i
would
like
to
comment
on
several
points
that
were
made
during
the
last
part.
i
suppose
the
first
one
is
to
deal
with
len
versus
stewart.
i
suppose
that
in
our
petition
for
certiorari
we
too
relied
upon
the
syllabus
that
it
was
a
due
process
case.
but
we
have
since
obtained
a
copy
of
the
briefs,
which
i
assume
you
have
judicial
notice
of
here,
and
it
is
quite
clear
from
the
briefs
that
that
case
was
basically
a
case
involving
the
scope
of
the
federal
employers
liability
act,
somewhat
like
the
bombalis
case
which
was
decided
about
that
time.
it
was
a
state
court
case
dealing
with
an
fela
action,
and
the
question
was
not
the
constitutionality
of
the
statute,
but
whether,
because
it
was
an
fela
statute,
it
was
preempted
by
federal
law.
and
i
will
cite
you
to
the
assignment
number
one
that's
in
the
plaintiff's...
i
mean,
in
the
railroad's
brief,
which
i
believe
is
the
total
argument
presented
to
justice
holmes
on
that
point.
the
opinion
says
the
question
is
whether
or
not
they
are,
i
believe
the
word
is,
"authorized",
what
is
authorized
to
apply
the
ten
percent.
the
holding
in
the
case
is
that
it
is
a
state
procedural
matter,
i
might
add,
your
honor,
a
procedural
matter,
and
thus
was
not
to
be
included
within
the
federal
employers
liability
act.
he
subsequently
cited
the
dickenson
case,
which
we've
cited
in
our
reply
brief,
in
which
he
cited
it
for
that
proposition.
there
is
not
one
mention
of
any
constitutional
issue
other
than
the
issue
of
preemption
or
supremacy
clause
under
the
fela
and
that
act.
and
i
do
not
believe
that
that
case...
i
know
it
was
not
argued
and
it
was
not
decided
on
any
question
dealing
with
due
process.
i
would
also
like
to
take
issue
with
mr.
haley's
reference
that
this
does
not
represent
a
windfall
for
the
plaintiff.
by
definition,
a
jury
has
determined
what
the
damages
in
this
case
are.
they
were
determined
to
be
quite
a
bit,
i
might
add,
in
this
case.
there
is
no
finding
of
any
sort
of
any
additional
damages
to
the
plaintiff.
there
has
been
no
trial
to
that.
it
is
an
arbitrary
matter.
mr.
haley
said
that
there
had
been
a
question
that
there
was
the
loss
with
respect
to
the
use
of
money
during
the
time
between
trial
and
appeal.
the
interest
statutes
are
there
under
the
state
and
the
federal.
i
might
add,
justice
scalia,
i
do
believe
the
interest
statute
is
in
a
different
situation,
because
the
federal
statute
there
is
far
more
specific
than
the
issue
you
have
here.
and
i
might
add--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--yes,
sir,
i
quite
agree.
in
fact,
the
national
marine
cooks
case
probably
would
indicate
that,
if
there
were
no
protection,
probably
both
as
to
the
property
protection
of
a
bond
and
the
protection
of
interest,
that
it
may
be
unconstitutional
to
stay.
i'd
not
deciding
that
case,
but
certainly
there's
a
suggestion
that
there's
a
constitutional
issue
if
these
provisions
are
not
allowed.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
well,
it
could
be
the
same
or
it
could
be
different,
your
honor.
i
believe
that
if
we
look
at
the
cases--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--attorney's
fees
statutes
are
attached
to
specific
substantive
laws
and
are
upheld
when
they
support
a
substantive
policy
represented
by
those
particular
acts.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
well,
i
would
cite
to
you
the
gulf,
colorado
case,
which
said
that
it
is
indeed
unconstitutional
just
to
say
because
you
are
a
railroad
you
have
to
pay
attorney's
fees.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
well,
it
is
the
only
case
that
i
know
of
where
attorney's
fees
are
assessed,
not
because
of
the
substance
of
the
claim,
but
because
of
the
identity
of
the
parties.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
and
that's
what
we
have
here,
is
that
the
penalty
is
related
to
the
identity
of
the
parties.
and
for
that
reason,
i
think
the
case
is
highly
persuasive.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
pardon?
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
because
it
relates
not
to
any
particular
case,
but
relates
to
the
mere
fact
that
you're
a
defendant
in
a
suit
dealing
with
money
or
property.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
and
lose.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
and
you
got
a
stay.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
i
can't--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--see
the
constitutional
problem
there.
of
course,
whether
the
bond
premium
is
appropriate
in
relation
to
the
risk,
i
suspect
that
potentially--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--i'm
happy
to
say
i've
never
had
to
get
a
bail
bond,
and
i
don't--
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
--well,
there's
precious
few
things
i
can
say
on
my
own
behalf,
but
that's
one
of
them.
mr.
l.
vastine
stabler,
jr.
i
would
like
to
say,
since
lindsey
versus...
i
mean,
rinaldi
versus
yeager,
there
was
some
discussion,
in
my
judgment
lindsey
versus
normet
is
virtually
on
all
fours
with
this
case
in
terms
of
the
equal
protection.
that
case
was
a
double
bond
penalty.
this
is
ten
percent.
it
was
related
to
a
specific
substantive
rule
in
illinois,
which
is
articulated
in
the
opinion
very,
very
clearly,
dealing
with
the
problems
of
getting
tenants
out,
and
there
were
problems
going
both
ways.
it
was
found
to
be
punitive.
it
was
a
violation
of
equal
protection.
it
was,
as
is
in
this
case,
a
price
that
is
charged
for
access
to
a
court.
