chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
argument
first
this
morning
in
number
85-2156,
shaare
tefila
congregation
versus
john
william
cobb.
mr.
brannan,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
rehnquist
ms.
brannan,
the
word
"discrimination",
of
course,
connotes
treating
some
people
differently
than
others,
and
your
idea
is
that
the
statute
covers
any
instance
in
which,
say,
a
frenchman
treats
a
german
differently
than
he
would
another
frenchman,
if
they
are
all
in
this
country?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
then
how
does
one
know
whether
a
decision
by
someone
of
french
extraction
to
treat
someone
of
german
extraction
differently
than
he
would
treat
other
people,
is
racially
motivated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
what
should
the
judge
charge
the
jury?
chief
justice
rehnquist
and
if
someone
of
french
extraction
then
thought
that
the
person
of
german
extraction
was
of
a
different
race,
that
would
be
sufficient?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
only
that
this
person-thought
that,
not
that
it
is
a
fact?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
unless
that's
what
congress
intended
to
be
determined
in
a
case
like
this.
chief
justice
rehnquist
what
if
i
take
a
dislike
to
people
with
brown
eyes,
and
i
say
that
i'm
just
not
going
to
deal
with
people
with
brown
eyes
the
same
way
i'm
going
to
deal
with
people
with
blue
eyes.
now,
if
i
deny
someone
a
right
on
that
basis,
is
that
actionable
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
could
that
be
racially
motivated?
chief
justice
rehnquist
how
is
the
judge
going
to
charge
the
jury?
what
should
they
ask
themselves,
to
decide
whether
someone
with
blue
eyes
who
treats
differently
people
with
brown
eyes
is
"discriminating"?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
it
has
to
have
a
historical
background.
in
other
words,
the
discrimination
would
have
to
be
going
on
for
a
while
before
it
would
be
actionable
under
the
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brannan.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mrs.
garren.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
garren.
ms.
brannan,
you
have
one
minute
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
ms.
brannan.
the
case
is
submitted.
