justice
scalia
but
if
you
had
discrimination
of
the
same
sort
by
a
frenchman
against
a
german,
just
because
he
doesn't
like
germans,
they
have
been
engaged
in
too
many
wars
and
that
other
frenchman
acknowledges
that
they
are
not
different
races,
then
it
wouldn't
be
actionable?
justice
scalia
why
isn't
it
enough
that
he
is
discriminating
against
germans,
and
germans
are
a
race
under
the
statute?
justice
scalia
he
is
discriminating
against
germans
as
germans,
not
because
he
thinks
germans
are
a
different
race
but
because
he
thinks
germans
are
germans,
and
under
the
statute
as
it
was
enacted
at
the
time,
it
was
agreed
that
germans
were
a
distinct
race.
justice
scalia
why
wouldn't
that
come
within
the
statute?
justice
scalia
it
would
make
a
lot
more
sense...
given
two
instances
of
discrimination
against
the
german,
you
would
want
us
to
find
one
actionable
and
the
other
one
not
actionable
simply
because
of
the
two
people
is
foolish
enough
to
think
that
germans
are
a
separate
race
and
the
other
one
isn't?
justice
scalia
so
long
as
they
are
intelligent
enough
to
know
that
they
are
not
a
distinct
racial
group,
it
would
be
okay;
they
could
paint
the
same
things
on
the
synagogue
so
long
as
they
know
that
the
jews
are
not
a
separate
race?
justice
scalia
it
didn't
extend
to
jews
who
were
atheists,
nonbelievers?
do
you
really
think
that
was
the
case?
justice
scalia
i
mean,
do
you
think
that
the
prejudice
that
existed
against
jews
in
this
country
was
only
against
believing
jews,
and
so
long
as
the
jew
said,
i
really
no
longer
believe
in
the
religious
tenets
of
judaism,
the
prejudice
no
longer
existed
and
that
person
would
have
been
able
to
get
into
all
sort
of
country
clubs
and
what
not?
justice
scalia
why...
you
want
us
to
use
modern
concepts
of
taxonomy
in
order
to
apply
this
statute?
justice
scalia
why?
justice
scalia
modern
perceptions
is
what
you
want
us
to
use?
justice
scalia
why
just
non-white?
i
mean,
wasn't
non-white...
do
you
contest
that
non-white
was
used
in
the
statute
to
mean
non-anglo-saxon?
i
mean,
isn't
there
a
lot
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
suggest
that
germans
would
have
been
considered
non-white
for
purposes
of
this
statute?
justice
scalia
wasn't
there
a
lot
in
the
legislative
history
that
showed
that
the
statute
was
a
reaction,
not
just
to
slavery
but
also
to
the
know-nothingism
that
had
grown
up
in
this
country,
and
that
it
was
intended
to
protect
irish
and
germans
in
particular?
justice
scalia
ms.
garren,
you
rely
on
the
fact
that
it
was
a
synagogue
to
show
that
it
was
racial...
religious
rather
than
racial.
but
actually,
they
just
went
across
the
street
to
the
synagogue
after
they
had
initially
spray
painted
a
drug
fair,
which
is
not
notably
religious.
[laughter]
justice
scalia
and
they
sprayed
the
drug
fair
with
the
words,
"white
power"
and
"aryan
brotherhood".
and
then
after
that
they
happened
to
see
a
synagogue
and
they
go
over
and
do
what
they
did
to
the
synagogue.
justice
scalia
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
predominantly
religious,
the
whole
episode.
justice
scalia
well,
then
i
don't
understand
why
the...
why
you
raise
the
fact
that
it
was
a
synagogue
and
saying
that
that
proves
something
about
the
case.
i
don't
see
that
it
does.
justice
scalia
what
if
i
just
disagree
with
them
as
to
whether
they
are
racially
distinct
within
the
meaning
that
the
framers
of
the
statute
had,
framers
who
thought
the
gypsies
were
a
race,
framers
who
thought
the
germans
were
a
race,
who
meant
by
"race"
a
stock?
justice
scalia
do
you
think
it
wouldn't
be
within
our
power,
given
the
status
of
the
case,
to
decide
it
on
that
basis?
justice
scalia
well,
i
mean--
[laughter]
justice
scalia
why
not
non-white?
what
groups
are
identified
as
races?
what
if
we
concluded
that
the
theory
of
these
people
was
scientifically
foolish
but
not
necessarily
socially
foolish?
there
are
a
lot
of
people
who
might
use
the
term
"jewish"
to
refer
to
what
they
think
is
a
racial
group,
a
stock.
justice
scalia
has
that
been
conceded
away
too,
that
there's
no
common
perception?
i
don't
recall
any...
i
do
recall
their
forcefully
arguing
that
they
are
not
scientifically...
jews
are
not
scientifically
a
race,
but
i
don't
recall
their
arguing
that
there
is
no
general
social
perception
that
to
be
a
jew
is
only
a
religious
thing.
