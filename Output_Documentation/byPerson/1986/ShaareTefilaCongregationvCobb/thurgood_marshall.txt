justice
marshall
where
do
you
want
to
go
to
find
this,
it
read
it,
if
you
are
part
scandinavian,
part
indian,
part
south
african,
part
japanese?
what
are
you?
what
book
do
you
find--
justice
marshall
--white
or
non-white?
justice
marshall
you
said
you
have
to
find
out
whether
you
are
white
or
non-white?
justice
marshall
what
did
you
say?
justice
marshall
how
did
he
become
identified
as
a
non-white
person?
justice
marshall
i
would
like
to
have
seen
you
identify
my
father.
he
was
white
with
blond
hair
and
blue
eyes.
justice
marshall
oh,
but
he
did.
he
was
a
negro.
i
am
trying
to
find
where
you...
what
do
you
do
with
sammy
davis?
[laughter]
justice
marshall
the
people
that
committed
this
act
knew
exactly
what
they
were
doing
and
they
knew
exactly
who
they
were
aiming
at,
didn't
they?
justice
marshall
and
should
be
punished.
justice
marshall
what?
justice
marshall
well,
if
they
are
black
and
jewish?
justice
marshall
but
not
because
they
are
jewish?
justice
marshall
if
they
painted
swastikas
they
wouldn't
have
a
cause
of
action
because
they
are
jewish?
justice
marshall
you
have
to
take
that
position.
justice
marshall
ms.
garren,
do
you
want
us
to
amend
mcdonald
and
say,
when
we
said
"white
people"
we
didn't
mean
jews?
justice
marshall
just
because
certain
jews
are
white
in
complexion
doesn't
take
away
the
rights
of
them
as
jews.
justice
marshall
well,
isn't
it
religious--
justice
marshall
--well,
this
is
not
religious
discrimination,
then.
justice
marshall
that's
the
only
thing
the
swastika
means.
justice
marshall
"death
to
the
jews".
that's
what
the
swastika
means.
justice
marshall
i
didn't
say
nazis.
i
said
anybody
that
uses
the
swastika
means,
"death
to
the
jews".
german,
american,
or
whoever
he
is,
you
don't
use
the
swastika.
justice
marshall
it
means
that
you
should
die.
justice
marshall
it
means
that
you
should
die.
justice
marshall
the
word
is
holocaust.
that's
what
the
swastika
means.
justice
marshall
how
could
they
protest
the
swastika
being
placed
on
their
building?
justice
marshall
well,
if
they
say
that,
if
you
just
painted
a
stroke
you're
desecrating
the
building.
justice
marshall
well,
this
was
more
than
that.
this
was
a
swastika.
justice
marshall
well,
what
statute
does
a
state
have
saying
you
shall
not
use
swastikas?
