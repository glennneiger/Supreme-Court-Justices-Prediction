ms.
deborah
t.
garren
mr.
chief
justice,
and
say
it
please
the
court:
you
have
heard
the
petitioners
argue
that
the
desecration
of
a
synagogue,
what
is
a
place
of
worship
is
covered
by
section
1982,
what
everyone
agrees
is
a
race
discrimination
statute,
because
these
defendants
allegedly
acted
out
of
a
completely
erroneous
and
irrational
belief
that
jewish
people
are
racially
distinct.
i
would
argue
that
inclusion
of
such
a
religious
discrimination
claim
within
the
scope
of
this
race
discrimination
statute
is
entirely
out
of
keeping
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
originally
enacted
and
its
specific
language
as
interpreted
by
this
court.
likewise,
and
particularly
importantly,
determination
of
the
coverage
of
section
1982
wholly
by
reference
to
the
illogical
and
erroneous
misperceptions
of
discriminators
is
a
far
cry
from
the
purpose
and
the
language
of
section
1982
as
it
has
been
interpreted
by
this
court.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
there
are
some
general
references
by
some
of
the
legislators
and
the--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--yes,
ma'am.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
think
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
congress
intended
to
define
the
coverage
of
the
statute
wholly
by
reference
to
intent.
in
other
words,
there
is
no
evidence
in
the
legislative
history
that
the
coverage
of
the
statute
is
determined
by
whether
or
not
a
defendant
arguably
acted
out
of
an
erroneous
and
illogical
racial
perception.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
would
say,
justice
o'connor,
that
in
this
case
the
petitioners
have
always
very
carefully
not
argued
that
jewish
people
have
any
sort
of
racial
identity
or
even
are
commonly
identified
by
society
as
racially
distinct.
they
haven't
made
that
argument
in
this
case.
there
may
have
been
some
general
references
in
the
legislative
history
to
jewish
people
as
members
of
a
different
race.
i
think
it
would
be
inappropriate
to
look
to
an
individual
legislator's
comment
regarding
that
as
determinative
of
the
coverage
of
the
statute.
there
is
certainly
no
indication
that
the
majority--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--yes,
ma'am,
and
that
is
what
you
all
have
done
in
determining
that
the
statute
is
limited
to
rights
which
are
racial
in
character
and
addresses
an
effort
to
achieve
racial
equality,
with
reference
to
people
who
are
members
of
specific
groups,
i
think.
and
whether
or
not
there
was
a
general
recognition
in
society
at
the
time
of
the
39th
congress
that
jews
are
racially
distinct,
it
is
something
that
has
never
been
argued
by
petitioners
in
this
case,
and
i
think
something
that
is
not
evidenced
in
the
legislative
history
either.
and
will
be
difficult
to
discern,
if
one
attempted
to
go
back
and
develop
racial
definitions
at
that
time.
i
would
argue
that
a
more
appropriate
approach
would
be
to
try
to
bring
the
statute
into
the
20th
century,
and
at
most,
in
an
effort
to
define
what
groups
are
covered,
to
look
at
whether
a
group...
an
individual
as
a
member
of
a
group
that
is
commonly
identified
as
non-white
or
is
commonly
identified
as
white,
that
is
reflective,
i
think,
of
the
specific
language
of
the
statute
and
also--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--yes,
ma'am.
i
understand
that.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
jewish
people
would
have
a
cause
of
action
based
on
discrimination
because
they
are
white,
if
that
was
their
contention,
but
that
is
not
their
contention
in
this
case.
they
also
do
not
contend
that
they
are
racially
distinct
from
whites
in
any
way.
so,
i
would
argue
that
they
do
not
fall
within
a
group
that
is
protected
by
the
statute.
there
is
no
evidence
that
they
fall
within
such
a
group.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
understand.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
your
honor,
i
am
not
attempting
to
suggest
that
the
court
define
scientific
categories
of
race,
as
has
been
suggested
by
the
petitioners.
i
think
what
you
would
do
with
those
sorts
of
cases
is,
first
of
all,
there
are
certain
groups
in
our
society
that
are
commonly
identified
as
non-white.
those
groups
would
be
entitled
to
protection,
and
if
an
individual
is
subjected
to
discrimination
because
he
is
perceived
to
be
a
member
of
such
a
group,
then
he
would
be
covered.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
it
is
a
perception
only
of
an
individual's
membership
in
a
group
that
is
commonly
identified
as
non-white.
and
that
is
something
that
the
jury
could
determine,
in
other
words,
whether
or
not
that
individual
was
acted
against
because
he
was
non-white.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
no,
i
think
it
does
not,
because
the
petitioner
argues
that
the
perceptions
of
the
discriminator,
without
reference
to
groups,
are
determinative.
in
other
words,
under
the
petitioner's
argument,
to
take
an
extreme
example,
if
a
group
of
anti-gay
people
decided
that
homosexuals
were
racially
different
than
others
and
discriminated
against
them
on
that
basis,
i
think
carrying
the
petitioners'
argument
to
its
logical
conclusion,
that
claim
would
be
covered
by
the
statute.
the
same
might
be
true
for
handicapped
individuals.
suppose
some
deviant
organization
in
our
society
decided
that
handicapped
people
were
different
racially
and
acted
against
them
on
that
basis,
i
believe
that
claim
also
would
be
covered
under
the
petitioners'
theory
for
coverage
of
this
statute.
so,
it
is
something
different.
it's
an
effort
to
bring
the
statute
into
the
20th
century
and
to
recognize
racial
groups
in
a
way
with
reference
to
society's
perceptions.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
again,
your
honor,
i
am
not
saying
that
anyone
has
to
make
that
determination.
i
am
saying
that
there
only
has
to
be
a
decision
by
a
jury
whether
you
are
discriminated
against
because
you
are
identified
as
non-white.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
pardon
me.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
no,
sir,
i
did
not
say
that.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
said
that
an
individual
could
obtain
the
coverage
of
the
statute
if
he
was
discriminated
against
because
he
is
identified
as
non-white,
or
as
a
member
of
a
group
that
is
commonly
identified
as
non-white.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
well,
i
think
one
obvious
way
in
which
he
would
be
identified
as
a
non-white
person
would
be
by
reference
to
immutable
physical
characteristics
such
as
skin
color,
which
we
traditionally
understand--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--in
that
case,
sir,
i
don't
think
he
would
have
a
cause
of
action
for
race
discrimination.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
sammy
davis
might
certainly
have
a
cause
of
action
for
race
discrimination.
he
would
not
have
a
cause
of
action
based
on
his
religion.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
your
honor,
i
understand
that
this
was
an
egregious
wrong.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
it's
one
that
cries
out
for
a
remedy.
that
is
correct.
and
there
was
a
remedy
here
available
to
these
petitioners.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
mr.
rehmer
was
convicted
of
malicious
destruction
of
property
and
was
sentenced
to
three
years,
the
maximum
sentence
for
that
offense.
criminal
restitution
was
available
to
the
petitioners
under
maryland
law.
in
addition,
they
had
many
common-law
actions
that
they
could
have
brought
in
the
state
courts.
instead,
they
asserted
them
as
pendent
claims
in
the
federal
court,
and
never
really,
seriously
wanted
to
pursue
those
state
claims
because
they
wanted
to
send
a
message
to
these
individuals
under
federal
civil
rights
law.
my
point
simply
is
that
you
can
only
send
that
message
if
congress
has
accorded
federal
jurisdiction
to
do
it,
and
that
there
is
no
indication
that
congress
intended
the
statute's
coverage
to
be
determined
by
reference
to
individual
discriminators'
illogical
and
irrational
perceptions
of
race.
there
has
to
be
something
more.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
yes,
sir.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
that
might
be
a
different
case,
your
honor.
i
can
imagine
a
circumstance
where
there
could
be
allegations
that
the
synagogue
was
defaced
because
its
members
were
predominantly
black,
in
which
case
clearly
they
would
be
able
to
assert
a
claim
under
section
1982.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
that's
correct.
that's
correct,
because
they
have
agreed
that
jewish
people
are
not
racially
distinct.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
think
they
have
a
cause
of
action
because
they
are
black.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
as
indicated--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--that's
correct,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
in
order
to
take
that
position,
you
would
have
to.
yes,
sir,
i
do.
[laughter]
you
would
have
to
define
the
scope
of
the
coverage
of
this
statute,
something
clearly
that
congress
and
now
the
courts
must
do,
by
reference
to
those
deviant
organizations'
decisions
about
jewish
racial
identity.
the
petitioners
herein
do
not
claim
a
jewish
racial
identity,
and
have
never
claimed
a
jewish
racial
identity,
nor
did
they
contend
that
they
are
commonly
identified
as
racial
or
non-white
in
any
sense.
it's
simply
a
matter
of
what
the
statute
was
intended
to
address.
it
was
not,
i
would
argue,
a
statute
to
root
out
all
forms
of
invidious
discrimination
or
bigotry
in
our
society.
this
court
has
held
that
it
does
not
address
sex
discrimination,
religious
discrimination,
national
origin
discriminations
standing
alone,
and
all
of
those
categories
would
be
pulled
in,
arguably,
under
the
petitioners'
theory.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
no,
sir,
i
am
not.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
that
is
correct.
that
group
would
be--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--well,
if
one
looks
to
the
actual
concern
of
the
legislators
in
passing
this
statute,
i
think
one
would
have
to
realize
that
it
was
passed
in
an
effort
to
protect
and
extend
the
rights
of
the
newly
freed
slaves.
and
this
court
has
indicated,
therefore,
that
blacks
are
protected,
and
has
subsequently
indicated
that
whites
as
well
are
protected.
the
additional
step
that
you
must
take,
not
in
my
case,
i
would
argue,
because
in
this
case
jewish
petitioners
have
indicated
that
they
do
not
have
a
racial
identity
but
in
the
case
that
follows
mine,
there
is
a
need
to
make
an
effort
to
define
race.
i
would
argue
that
the
petitioners
just
throw
that
out
the
window
and
say,
we
don't
need
to
define
it;
we
don't
need
to
determine
what
groups
are
protected
by
this
statute;
we'll
determine
the
statute's
coverage
by
reference
to
each
individual's
deviant
ideas,
without
any
reference
to
protected
groups
in
our
society.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
your
honor,
i
would--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--prejudice
that
is
based
on
their
religion.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
that
is
the
characteristic
that
defines
them.
there
is
no
racial
characteristic
that
in
fact
defines
people
of
the
jewish
faith.
it
is
a
religion.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
no,
sir,
but
again
that
was
the
deviant
perception
of
a
couple
of
organizations
in
the
society
that
had
run
rampant.
it
wasn't
a
common
perception
in
the
society.
they
weren't
commonly
identified.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
of
the
prejudice
against
jewish
people?
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
think
i
am
not
qualified
to
comment
on
that,
but
i
have
every
reason
to
believe
that
religion
in
part
motivated
that
prejudice
because
that
is
what
in
fact
defines
the
group.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i'm
not
sure
i
understand
your
question,
justice
scalia.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
no,
sir,
but
i
do
think
that
the
discriminators
identify
the
group
by
their
religious
beliefs.
they
may
not
know
in
each
individual
instance
whether
that
jewish
person
follows
his
faith
or
not.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
no,
i
don't
think
i
do,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
don't
think
i
do.
i
am
not
suggesting
that
you
attempt
to
define
racial
categories
in
a
taxonomical
fashion,
or
any
kind
of
scientific
way,
because
i
do
think
there
are
incredible
difficulties
with
doing
that.
i
am
saying
that--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--common
identification
of
a
group
as
non-white
in
our
society,
and
that's
an
approach
that
the
lower
courts
have
taken
without
fail
in
attempting
to
grapple
with
these
cases.
and
none
of
those
lower
courts
have
included
jewish
people
within
the
rubric
of--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--there
may
be
statements
by
individual
legislators
with
reference
to
a
german
race.
now,
whether
that
individual
legislator
considered
germans
to
be
non-white,
i
don't
know.
i
have
no
reason
to
think
that
the
legislature
intended
to
address
the
rights
of
germans
when
it
passed
the
race
discrimination
statute.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
the
respondents
in
the
case
that
follows
us
have
discussed
some
of
those
references.
i
do
not
think
there
is
a
lot
in
the
legislative
history
to
that
effect,
nor
do
i
think
that
that
would
represent
the
majority
opinion
of
the
legislators.
i
think
the
primary
emphasis
was
on
protecting
the
rights
of
newly
freed
slaves
and
blacks
in
the
south
when
that
statute
was
passed.
it
was
a
reconstruction
era
statute.
and
the
courts
have
now
extended
it...
you
all
have
now
extended
it
to
encompass
whites.
the
question
is,
how
one
defines
additional
categories
that
it
would
cover,
and
i
think
it
is
with
reference
to
those
two
categories
that
one
defines
the
definition.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
no,
sir.
i
think,
again,
that
jewish
people
have
a
cause
of
action
based
on
their
whiteness.
if
they
are
discriminated
against
because
they
are
white
they
can
sue.
if
a
jewish
person
is
discriminated
against
because
he
is
black,
he
can
sue.
jewish
people
don't
have
a
racial
identity,
as
the
petitioners
have
recognized,
as
the
lower
courts
have
recognized,
as
we
recognize.
they
have
a
cause
of
action
if--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--those
are
rights
against
religious
discrimination.
there's
no--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--[inaudible]
jewish
people
are
racially
distinct.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
would
say
this
is
religious
discrimination,
and
is
not
encompassed
within
this
race
discrimination
statute.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
a
synagogue
was
desecrated.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
appreciate
what
nazis
believed
and
i
also
think
that
that
is
not
a
belief
that
is
common
to
society.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
well,
i
think
even
the
petitioners
in
this
case
would
agree
that
a
claim
would
not
be
covered
if
the
swastika
wasn't
used
to
indicate
that
jews
are
racially
inferior.
that's
what
results
from
their
standard.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
pardon?
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
these
are
horrible
views.
the
question
is
whether
or
not
we
should
determine
that--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--i
understand
that
jewish
people
have
been
subjected
to
historical
discrimination,
that
it's
an
awful
circumstance.
but
whereas
here
these
petitioners
were
not
without
a
remedy
to
make
them
whole,
there
isn't
any
need
to
extend
a
federal
statute
to
cover
any
situation
where
a
defendant
acted
out
of
a
misperception.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
well,
i
think
first
of
all
that
they
could
have
pursued
these
fellows
in
state
courts.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
that's
true,
your
honor.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
understand
that,
your
honor,
and
i
think
that
the
state
courts
likewise
would
have
addressed
that
circumstance.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
the
state
doesn't
have
such
a
statute,
your
honor.
however,
i
think
the
egregious
nature
of
the
conduct
in
this
case
would
have
been
addressed
by
reference
to
punitive
damages,
for
instance,
in
common-law
actions;
by
reference
to
criminal
restitution,
by
reference
to
sentencing.
and
i
think
it
was.
with
respect
to
criminal
sentencing,
at
least
with
respect
to
the
individual
whom
i
represent,
he
received
the
maximum
sentence
and
that
is
an
uncommon
thing
for
malicious
destruction
of
property
in
the
state
of
maryland.
that
reflects
an
effort
by
the
state
to
address
the
seriousness
of
the
act.
your
honor,
i
don't
know
the
circumstances
surrounding
the
others.
it's
not
part
of
the
record
and
i
have
no
way
of
knowing
whether
there's
even
sufficient
proof
to
tie
them
in
with
this
incident.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
that's
correct.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
no
one
has
denied,
at
least
for
purposes
of
this
appeal,
that
these
defendants
acted
out
of
a
belief
that
jews
are
racially
inferior
and
that
the
symbols
they
painted
suggested
that.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
what
happens
when...
if
the
court
applies
this
misperception
standard,
to
use
a
shortened
term,
then
in
essence
all
religious
discrimination
claims,
national
origin
discrimination
claims,
even
some
sex
discrimination
claims
might
come
within
this
race
discrimination
statute.
that
is
the
point
i
am
trying
to
make
when
i
say,
this
is
really
religious
discrimination
and
it's
an
effort
to
use
a
standard
that
will
result
in
an
unmanageable
approach
to
this
statute,
i
think,
in
the
lower
courts
and
one
that
is
not
consonant
with
the
purpose
of
the
statute
as
originally
enacted,
and
with
its
language.
the
problem
is
with
the
standard
that
the
petitioners
urge
and
the
results
that
could
accrue
if
that
standard
is
applied,
and
i
don't
think
in
this
case...
it
really
isn't
necessary
that
you
engage
in
this
racial
definition
that
we
have
been
hassling
with
because
the
petitioners
indicate
that
they
are
not
racially
distinct,
and
jewish
people
are
not
racially
distinct.
recognizing
that,
they
have
attempted
to
argue
that
the
perceptions
of
the
individual
defendants,
erroneous
and
irrational
perceptions
are
what
determine
the
coverage
of
a
federal
civil
rights
statute.
that
just
can't
be
right.
there
is
no
evidence
that
that
is
what
determines
the
coverage
of
this
statute
in
the
legislative
history.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
understand.
it
would
be
my
position
that
the
petitioners
have
essentially
stipulated
that
away
here.
they
have
never
contended
that
jews
are
racially
distinct
or
commonly
identified
as
such,
nor
do
they
want
that
characterization.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
clearly
it
would
be
within
your
power.
i
think
that
it
would
be--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--inappropriate.
i
think
that
it
would
be
an
inappropriate
interpretation
of
the
statute.
it
would
result
in
you
having
to
reach
back
to
the
1860's
and
determine
what
groups
society
then
regarded
as
racially
distinct,
and
i
don't
think
that
is
a
practical
approach
to
interpreting
the
statute.
a
more
appropriate
approach,
i
think,
is
to
look
to
our
society
now
and
determine
what
groups
are
commonly
identified
as
non-white,
with
reference
to
what
we
all
recognize
as
racial
characteristics.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
think
that
the
petitioners
would
disagree
that
there
is
any
kind
of
common
perception.
i
understand,
your
honor--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--i
think
that
they
have
never
indicated
that
there
is
a
common
perception
in
our
society
today
that
jews
are
racially
distinct
either.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
yes,
sir.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
that
is
why
i
would
take
the
position
that
it
isn't
appropriate
to
define
races
by
reference
to
any
kind
of
scientific
terminology.
in
fact,
an
appropriate
approach
is--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--the
approach
that,
in
fact,
anthropologists
take
in
many
instances
is
by
reference
to
culture
and
by
reference
to
common
perceptions
in
society.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
do
not
believe
a
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
the
jewish
people
are
commonly
identified
as
racially
different.
that's
what
i
am
referring
to
when
i
say
that
cultural--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--one
evaluates
whether
those
individuals...
you
look
at
the
individual,
first
of
all,
and
you
evaluate
whether
that
individual
is
identified
as
white
or
is
identified
as
non-white
in
our
society,
in
some
sense.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
there
are
various
groups
that
would
fall
in
the
non-white
category.
this
isn't
an
effort
to
get
at
defining
what
race
means.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
i
think
it's
quite
conceivable
that
hispanics
would
be
a
group
that
is
commonly
identified
as
non-white
in
our
society.
several
of
the
lower
circuit
courts
have
held
that
and
have
approached
the
statute
in
precisely
the
way
that
i
am
suggesting
that
you
approach
it.
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
"moslems"
is
a
religious
term,
i
believe.
again,
it
would
require
the
courts
to
evaluate
whether
there
is
a
common
identification
of
that
group
as
racially
distinct,
or
non-white
in
our
society.
for
my
individual
reaction--
ms.
deborah
t.
garren
--i
think
that
those
groups
would
be
included
within
the
categories
that
are
protected
because
in
many
instances
individuals
that
are
in
those
groups
have
dark
skin,
for
example.
and
there
can
be
no
doubt
that
if
an
individual
is
discriminated
against
because
he
is
black
and
has
dark
skin,
or
a
large
number
of
members
of
that
group
are
black
and
have
dark
skin,
they
would
have
a
cause
of
action
under
this
statute.
in
conclusion,
i
would
like
to
say
that
where,
as
here,
there
are
adequate
state
remedies
available
to
the
petitioners,
it
is
not
necessary
to
stretch
section
1982
to
cover
every
defendant's...
every
defendant
who
is
motivated
by
an
irrational
and
erroneous
racial
perception,
and
therefore
i
would
ask
the
lower
courts
to
uphold...
this
court
to
uphold
the
lower
courts'
dismissal
of
this
claim
for
the
desecration
of
a
synagogue
under
section
1982.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
