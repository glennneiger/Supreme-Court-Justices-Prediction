justice
o'connor
ms.
brannan,
are
you
asking
us,
in
effect,
to
equate
race
with
national
origin
discrimination?
is
that
what
it
approaches?
justice
o'connor
ms.
garren,
there
is
some
evidence
in
the
legislative
history,
of
course,
that
congress
had
in
mind
treating
race
to
cover
such
things
as
gypsies
and
chinese
and
germans
and
so
forth,
is
there
not?
justice
o'connor
president
johnson
vetoed
the
statute
because
he
thought
it
was
unwise
to
sweep
in
chinese
and
gypsies,
didn't
he?
justice
o'connor
so,
there
is
some
legislative
history
to
support
the
approach
that
congress,
at
least,
in
enacting
section
1982,
may
have
intended
to
cover
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
a
different
version
of
what
constitutes
race
than
we
would
have
today?
justice
o'connor
that
may
be
true,
but
how
about
the
argument
that
apparently
is
going
to
be
made
in
the
companion
case,
rather
than
here,
that
indeed
the
statute
does
cover
discrimination
against
jews
because
they
are
jews?
justice
o'connor
well,
it
would
be
appropriate,
though,
to
look
to
the
legislative
history
to
determine
what
it
is
that
congress
had
in
mind
in
passing
this
statute?
justice
o'connor
this
court
has
brought
whites
within
the
protection
of
the
act
in
mcdonald.
justice
o'connor
it
is
unlawful
to
discriminate
against
white
people.
so,
how
can
you
now
exclude
jews?
justice
o'connor
in
your
view,
would
hispanics...
how
about
hispanics
and
arabs.
would
they
fit
in
your
category?
justice
o'connor
and
how
about
moslems
or
arabs?
justice
o'connor
yes.
