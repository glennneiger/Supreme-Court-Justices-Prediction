ms.
garren,
there
is
such
a
thing
as
an
ethiopian
jew,
isn't
there?
justice
blackmun
suppose
this
synagogue
had
been
one
for
ethiopian
jews?
justice
blackmun
black,
not
jewish,
then?
justice
blackmun
are
you
taking
the
position,
however,
that
the
statute
is
applicable
only
to
blacks?
justice
blackmun
so,
if
it
were
the
yellow...
they
were
chinese
you
would
say
the
statute
is
applicable?
justice
blackmun
and
yet,
when
the
statute
was
enacted,
the
concern
was
with
the
freed
men,
was
it
not?
