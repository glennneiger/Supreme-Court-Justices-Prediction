justice
jr.
mrs.
garren,
the
problem
we
have
in
the
united
states...
when
i
say
a
problem,
it's
perhaps
a
great
asset
of
our
country...
is
that
we
have
so
many
different
races
that
over
a
period
of
many
years
that
there
have
been
a
great
many
intermarriages.
we
have
a
heterogeneous
society.
how
would
your
theory
fit,
for
example,
if
a
white
had
married
an
asian
and
their
progeny,
children,
grandchildren,
would...
would
they
be
a
member
of
the
white
race
or
an
oriental
race?
justice
jr.
you
can
cite
any
number
of
examples
like
that.
we
see
them
every
day.
we
have
friends
like
that.
what
do
we
do
about
that?
justice
jr.
that
is
matter
of
perception?
justice
jr.
does
that
bring
you
close
to
the
position
of
your
opposition
here
today?
