unknown
speaker
that
is
the
position
you
are
urging
us
to
take,
though,
isn't
it?
unknown
speaker
they
in
fact
didn't.
i'm
not
saying
they
just
admit...
they
in
fact
didn't.
they
in
fact
know
that
jews
are
not
a
separate
race.
but
they
still
set
out
to
defame
and
cause
injury
to
jews.
do
you
think
that
that
would
not
be
covered,
so
long
as
the
individual
is
not
doing
it
because
he
thinks
jews
are
a
separate
race?
unknown
speaker
don't
change
my
hypothetical.
i
am
giving
you
a
hypothetical
in
which
the
individual
knows
jews
are
not
a
separate
race
and
paints
the
same
things
as
were
painted
here
on
the
synagogue.
now,
under
your
theory
if
i
understand
it
correctly,
that
would
not
be
actionable?
unknown
speaker
make
believe,
all
right?
unknown
speaker
accept
my
hypothetical.
under
your
theory
it
would
not
be
actionable;
isn't
that
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
in
the
legislative
history
supports
that
very
unusual
approach
to
the
statute,
and
perhaps
unworkable
approach?
unknown
speaker
i
asked
about
the
legislative
history.
unknown
speaker
well,
there
may
be
some
support
in
the
legislative
history
for
treating
jews
as
a
separate
race
or
treating
germans
as
a
separate
race.
but
i
don't
see
anything
in
the
legislative
history
that
would
make
it
turn
on
the
relative
sophistication
of
the
person
doing
the
discriminating,
which
you
are
urging.
the
view
of
the
discriminator...
i
mean,
that's
what
gets
you
into
a
very
peculiar
approach
here.
and
is
there
anything
in
the
legislative
history
to
support
that?
unknown
speaker
but
why
isn't
it
enough
if
the
intent
is
to
discriminate
against
a
race,
as
race
was
understood
when
the
statute
was
enacted?
you
are
not
just
insisting
that
the
intent
be
to
discriminate
against
a
race,
but
you
are
insisting
that
the
intent
be
to
discriminate
against
a
race
because
it
is
a
race,
not
because
we
have
been
at
war
with
germans
for
200
years,
but
because
germans
are
a
separate
race.
now,
why
do
you
have
to
add
in
that
qualification
under
the
statute?
isn't
enough
that
you
are
discriminating
against
a
race?
isn't
that
all
the
statutory
language
would
require?
unknown
speaker
why?
where
is
that
in
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
do
you
think
mcdonald
would
have
come
out
differently
if
a
person
just
didn't
like
the
color
of
the
white
race's
skin,
or
of
the
black
race's
skin
and
was
discriminating
on
that
ground,
although
still
discriminating
against
a
race?
unknown
speaker
that's
what
i
was
wondering
about.
what
would
you
say
if
they
painted
swastikas
on
the
synagogue
on
lenox
avenue
in
the
middle
of
harlem?
there
is
a
synagogue
there.
unknown
speaker
and
there
is
not
a
white
person
within
ten
blocks.
unknown
speaker
well,
you
couldn't
do
it
an
race,
could
you?
unknown
speaker
but
there
are
no
jews
in
that
synagogue.
there
are
no
white
jews,
i
would
say.
unknown
speaker
if
these
people
had
just
vandalized
the
synagogue
without
painting
anything,
swastikas
or
anything
like
that,
they
had
just
trashed
the
place,
would
you
be
here?
unknown
speaker
you
would
then
have
to
have
some
other
evidence
that
they
did
it
on
a
racial
basis?
unknown
speaker
but
if
it
turned
out
that
they...
as
justice
scalia
suggested,
if
it
turned
out
that
as
a
matter
of
fact
they
knew
that
jews
were
not
a
different
race,
they
claimed
that
they
just
didn't
like
jews,
you
wouldn't
be
here
then?
unknown
speaker
and
you
would...
in
that
case
you
wouldn't
even
be
here
if
you
determined
or
you
wouldn't
even
be
here,
even
arguably
under
the
statute,
claiming
that
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
that
jews
were
considered
to
be
enough
different
to
be
covered
by
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
you
don't
want
to
urge
in
this
court,
i
take
it,
that
jews
are
a
different
race?
unknown
speaker
and
you
don't
want
to...
you
are
not
urging
that
congress
thought
jews
were
a
different
race
at
the
time
they
passed
the
statute?
unknown
speaker
well
do
you
think
it
would
be
error
if
we
read
the
legislative
history
to
say,
congress
thought
that
jews
were
a
different
race
and
therefore
the
statute
covers
it?
would
we
be
in
error?
unknown
speaker
and
could,
under
your
theory,
these
respondents
have
been
prosecuted
criminally
under
the
criminal
counterpart
of
these
statutes?
unknown
speaker
ms.
brannan,
you
have
a
lot
of
trouble
with
this
screws
case
which
says,
you
must
have
an
intent
to
deprive
somebody
of
a
right,
a
specific
right.
remember
that
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
in
this
you'd
have
it
awful
hard
to
prove
that
criminally,
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt.
unknown
speaker
it
doesn't
say
that
the
result...
the
man
was
killed.
screws
says
it
was
what
was
in
the
man's
mind.
you
have
to
prove
that
he
intended
not
only
to
kill
but
to
kill
in
order
to
deny
him
a
constitutional
right.
well,
that
would
be
a
lot
of
problem
in
this
case.
unknown
speaker
if
your
interpretation
is
correct,
do
you
think
that
it
will
eliminate
or
sweep
out
of
the
way
some
specific
exceptions
that
were
enacted
in
title
viii,
the
housing
act
where
congress
specifically
exempted
some,
forms
of
possible
discrimination?
i
guess
those
would
just
be
swept
away
by
the
potential
for
suit
under
this
section?
unknown
speaker
well,
certainly,
your
interpretation
would
make
useless
the
reservations
expressed
in
title
viii
for
certain
types
of
discriminatory
conduct.
unknown
speaker
well,
but
it
would
open
up
for
suit,
if
you
are
correct,
various
things
that
were
reserved
in
title
viii,
for
example
the
duplex
housing
when
the
owner
lives
in
part
of
the
duplex,
and
that
sort
of
thing.
unknown
speaker
well,
except
that
you
would
extend
it
to
every
other
possible
source
of
national
origin?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
justice
o'connor's
point,
i
think,
is
that
title
viii
has
some
meaning.
if
you
assume
that
what
title
viii
was
doing
was
extending
to
persons
other
than
just
blacks
the
guarantees
of
1982.
but
now,
under
your
theory,
title
viii
doesn't
do
anything
that
1982
doesn't
already
do.
unknown
speaker
could
i
just
explore
again
what
you
mean
by
racial
motivation?
suppose
a
landlord
doesn't
want
a
particular
racial
group,
just
because
the
landlord
thinks
that
that
racial
group
is
sloppy,
just
has
made
the
judgment
that
the
group
as
a
whole
is
sloppy.
now,
would
that
be
the
racial
motivation?
unknown
speaker
but
the
landlord
has
to
believe
that
it's...
if
the
landlord
just
believed
that,
let's
say,
all
frenchmen
are
sloppy,
but
knew
that
frenchmen
were
not
a
separate
racial
group,
that
would
be
okay?
unknown
speaker
or
let's
say,
all
puerto
ricans
or
all
italians
or
whatever?
so
long
as
the
landlord
knows
that
is
not
a
racial
group,
that's
perfectly
okay?
unknown
speaker
very
strange.
unknown
speaker
it
seems
to
me
you
are
only
getting
at
the
ill-educated
discriminator,
right?
