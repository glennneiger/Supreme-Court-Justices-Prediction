justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
a
question
about
your
last
comment?
do
you
think
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed
that
the
people
who
voted
for
the
statute
thought
that
jews
were
racially
distinct
or
not?
justice
stevens
maybe
it
should.
but
you
don't
contend
that
at
the
time
the
statute
was
passed,
that
the
authors
of
the
statute
might
well
have
used
the
term
"race"
in
a
way
that
would
have
treated
the
jews
as
a
separate
race?
justice
stevens
but
you
don't
rely
on
that
fact?
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
ms.
garren,
over
the...
years
ago,
and
of
course
it's
still
prevalent
in
some
areas,
there
was
prejudice
against
jews.
that
was
known
in
our
society.
there
was
a
lot
of
anti-semitism.
how
would
you
characterize
that
prejudice?
justice
stevens
you
wouldn't
call
it
racial
prejudice?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
it
was
based
entirely
on
their
religion?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
that
would
be
the
proper
characterization
in
germany
when
it
was
so
virulent?
justice
stevens
do
you
think
the
origin
of
the
prejudice
in
this
country
was
entirely
religious?
justice
stevens
yes.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask,
is
it
critical
to
your
case
that
there
be
some
well-defined
categories
of
races?
i
imagine
at
one
time,
perhaps
scientists
might
have
thought
there
were
five
or
six
races,
or
ten
or
twenty.
now,
they
seem
to
say
there
are
three,
is
it,
three
races.
what
if
20
years
from
now
they
really
study
this
thing
and
determine
there
is
only
one
race,
that
really,
the
differences
among
the
races
are
not
scientifically
significant?
justice
stevens
then,
i
suppose
the
statute
would
just
have...
no
longer
have
any
significance.
justice
stevens
well,
how
do
you
define
race,
then?
if
you
don't
do
it
by
reference
to
scientific
standards,
what
are
the
standards
for
defining
whether
two
people
are
in
different
races
or
not?
justice
stevens
well,
if
you
look
at
culture,
i
suppose
a
pretty
strong
argument
could
be
made
that
the
jewish
have
a
very
special
culture
of
their
own.
justice
stevens
what
i
am
trying
to
get
at
is,
how
does
one
decide
whether
two
people
are
in
the
same
or
different
races?
justice
stevens
so,
now
we've
got
two
races,
white
and
non-white?
we're
down
to
two,
is
that
it?
