ms.

mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
presents
the
issue,
whether
a
complaint
that
alleges
racially
motivated
discrimination
and
harassment
against
jews
may
state
a
claim
under
title
42
of
the
united
states
code,
section
1982.
the
complaint
alleged
that
respondents'
desecration
of
the
synagogue
of
shaare
tefila
congregation
was
racially
motivated
and
hence
covered
by
the
statute.
the
complaint
further
alleged
that
the
facts
that
supported
the
allegation
of
racial
motivation
were
principally
the
character,
symbols
and
words
that
respondents
themselves
painted
on
the
synagogue.
the
complaint
alleged
that
they
painted
the
words,
"dead
jew,
death
to
the
jew.
"
they
painted
swastikas,
and
on
a
door
the
words,
"in,
take
a
shower,
jew.
"
they
painted
the
garbled
german
words,
"toten
kamf
verband"
next
to
a
skull
and
crossbones.
the
"toten
kamf
verband"
with
the
death
head
units
of
concentration
camp
guards
in
nazi
germany,
and
the
skull
and
crossbones
was
their
symbol.
these
words
and
symbols
invoked
nazi
ideology,
and
it
was
one
of
the
principal
tenets
of
nazi
ideology,
both
in
nazi
germany
in
the
1930s
and
'40s
and
among
neo-nazi
groups
in
this
country
today
that
jews
are
racially
non-white
and
inferior
to
whites.
the
complaint
further
alleged
that
respondents
painted
the
words,
"ku
klux
kian",
and
the
burning
cross,
the
familiar
symbol
of
the
kian.
kian
groups,
like
the
nazis,
hold
as
one
of
their
central
tenets
that
jews
are
racially
distinct
from
whites
and
inferior.
the
fourth
circuit
court
of
appeals
split
on
the
issue
as
to
whether
this
conduct
stated
a
section
1982
claim.
a
majority
affirmed
the
dismissal
of
the
complaint,
holding
that
because
jews
are
not
racially
distinct
or
non-white,
this
conduct
does
not
state
a
1982
claim.
but
in
dissent,
judge
wilkinson
recognized
that
although
jews
are
not
racially
distinct
from
whites,
when
they
suffer
racially
motivated
deprivation
of
rights
protected
by
the
statute,
they
like
any
other
group
should
be
covered.
we,
of
course,
agree
that
jews
are
not
racially
distinct
from
whites.
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse
the
fourth
circuit
and
to
hold,
consistent
with
its
prior
cases--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--i
believe
that
they
did,
under
the
common
understanding
of
the
word
"race"
at
that
time.
that
issue
has
been
briefed
in
greater
detail,
actually,
in
the
st.
francis
college
case.
for
our
purposes,
we
don't
believe
that
that
even
would
matter.
that
what
really
matters,
if
persons
who
discriminate
against
jews,
arabs
or
other
minorities
now,
who
do
that
because
they
view
them
as
racially
distinct,
that
that
conduct
should
be
covered.
after
all--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--we
believe
that
they
did
use
that
term
at
that--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--we
don't
believe
that
that
really
adds
to
the
argument
that
we
are
making.
i
am
reminded,
in
answering
your
question,
of
justice
marshall's
language
in
the
mcdonald
case,
that
at
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
statute
in
1866,
congress
probably
didn't
anticipate
racial
discrimination
against
whites
of
the
sort
that
this
court
held
in
mcdonald
to
be
covered.
but
congress
had
an
open-ended
concept
of
what
it
was
covering,
that
there
would
be
new
groups
coming
to
this
country;
new
kinds
of
discrimination
undoubtedly
would
arise.
and
it
was
the
discrimination
itself
that
congress
focused
on,
not
particular
groups
and
whether
they
were
covered.
that
is
also
illustrated,
we
believe,
in
the
legislative
history
by
the
repeated
references
to
germans
and
swedes
and
other
groups
as
a
race
who
really...
it
just
isn't
thought
any
more
that
those
groups
are
racial--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--no,
justice
rehnquist.
the
principle
for
which
we
argue
is
more
narrow.
that
would
only
be
covered
if
it
is
racially
motivated
discrimination.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
we
think
that
that
is
a
question
for
the
finder
of
fact
as
it
would
be
in
any--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--the
judge
should
charge
the
jury
that
the
standard
is
racial
motivation,
and
that
that
can
be
evidenced
by
statements
and
admissions
of
the
defendants,
by
any,
for
instance,
expert
opinion
as
we
put
in,
in
this
case,
that
indeed
this
very
conduct
and
these
very
symbols--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--yes,
it
would,
if
it
can
be
established...
and
the
plaintiff,
of
course,
has
the
burden
of
proof.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
that's
exactly
right.
and
the
reason--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--unless
the
plaintiff
could
prove,
of
course,
that
that
statement
was
false
or
that
acknowledgment
was
false.
and
the
reason
we
think
that
that
is
a
principled
and
fair
distinction,
in
fact
supported
by
this
court's
cases,
is
the
court
has
held
that
these
statutes
address
discrimination
that
is
racial
in
character.
there
is
something
especially
invidious,
in
the
eyes
of
the
1866
congress,
about
racial
discrimination,
that
if
the
discrimination
were
just
for
some
other
reason,
it
isn't--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--well--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--that
is--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--that
is
another
way
of
approaching
the
issue
that
we
think
is
very
fair
in
light
of
the
legislative
history,
and
indeed,
would
lead
to
a
reversal
at
this
case
and
an
affirmance
in
the
st.
francis
college
case
as
well.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
the
only
difficulty,
as
we
have
argued
in
our
briefs,
is
that
at
all
costs
we
would
want
the
courts
to
avoid
is
the
issue
of
defining
race
in
order
to
determine
coverage.
we
believe
that
was
one
of
the
key
errors
of
the
fourth
circuit
majority,
that
they
had
a
notion,
a
correct
notion
that
jews
are
not
racially
distinct
from
white,
and
they
let
their
correct
idea
get
in
the
way
of
dealing
with
this
discrimination
on
the
terms
of
the
discriminators
themselves,
and
that
certainly
we
wouldn't
want
the
lower
federal
courts
to
be
analyzing,
are
jews
racially
distinct,
are
germans
or
arabs
or
any
other
group
racially
distinct.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
and
we
believe,
justice
rehnquist,
that
the
legislative
history
demonstrates
it's
not
at
all
what
they
intended,
and
that
in
fact
this
court's
analysis
of
that
history
in
the
mcdonald
case
makes
that
very
clear.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
well,
the
answer
is,
of
course,
unless
it's
racially
motivated
in
our
society.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
it
could
be
if
there
were
facts
to
show
that
historically,
or
in
our
society,
and
in
the
eyes
of
the
discriminators,
was
a
racial
distinction,
and
the
hypothetical--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--the
charge
should
be
whether
it
is
conduct
that
we
understand
as
racial,
as
based
on
that
person
and
their
heritage
and
background
and
what
they
are
in
unchangeable
ways,
unlike,
for
instance
religion,
and
that
that
should
be
backed
up
in
the
evidence
and
the
plaintiff
has
the
burden
to
show
that
it
ties
in
historically
or
culturally
with
an
understanding
that
is
racial.
in
the
hypothetical
you
posed,
that
probably
would
be
an
unlikely
result,
that
a
plaintiff
could
prevail
in
a
case
like
that.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
not
necessarily.
if
there
developed
now,
for
instance,
a
notion
that
french
canadians
are
racially
distinct
and
there
were
kian-like
groups
who
were
out
to
do
the
sorts
of
things
that
happened
at
shaare
tefila
to
french-canadians,
i
don't
think
we
would
have
to
wait
for
some
period
of
time
but
we
would
need
to
show
that
they
view
their
conduct
as
racially
motivated
against
those
groups.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
we
are
not.
we
are
looking
to
the
facts
of
this
case
and
saying
that,
given
the
historic
and
contemporary
link
in
the
eyes
of
people
who
lash
out
at
jews,
that
they
are
a
racial
group;
that
we
really
needn't
broach
that
question
in
this
case
at
all.
but
to
go
back
up--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--in
this
case,
justice
scalia--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--no.
i
don't
think
it
turns
only
on
admissions.
in
this
case,
if
the
respondents
denied
up
and
down
that
they
had
a
racial
belief
about
jews,
i
think--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--well,
i
have
some
difficulty,
i
suppose,
with
the
notion
of,
you
know,
"they
don't
think",
because
given
the
content
of
the
message
that
they
put
up
on
the
walls
of
shaare
tefila,
it
really
evokes
a
racist
history.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
under
my
theory,
i
guess
i
can't
reconcile
them
knowing
that
jews
are
racially
distinct
and
still
invoking
the
holocaust.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
all
rights.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
if
we
could
know
completely
what
was
in
their
minds,
it
would
not
be
actionable.
but
perhaps
to
work
a
variation
on
your
hypothetical--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--well,
we
think
in
fact
that
the
approach
is
directly
in
line
with
this
court's
cases,
particularly
the
mcdonald
and
general
building--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--and
what
is
supportive
in
the
legislative
history
was
the
repeated
references--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--well,
justice
o'connor,
we
think
it
isn't
so
much
the
sophistication
as
the
intent
of
the
discriminator,
and
that
is
an
issue
that
this
court
addressed
in
terms
of
the
legislative
history
in
general
building
contractors,
and
held
that
intent
is
the
touchstone
of
coverage,
that
a
plaintiff
now
has
to
show
racially
discriminatory
intent.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes,
but
the
difference,
i
think,
between
the
last
part
of
what
you
said
and
what
we
are
arguing,
justice
scalia,
is
the
motivation
of
the
actor
must
be
racially
discriminatory.
that
is
the
thing
that
we
are
emphasizing.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
well,
basically
because
this
court
so
held
in
general
building
contractors
and
mcdonald,
but
that
has
been
the
thing
that
the
court
has
looked
to,
not
who
the
group
is,
who
is
the
victim,
but
what
the
intent
is
as
demonstrated
by
the
acts
and
by
statements
and
by
the
usual
evidence
that
fact
finders
look
at
to
measure
intent.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
well,
in
our
society
skin
color
is
very
wrapped
up,
of
course,
with
issues
of
race
and
i
am
not
sure
that
those
two
things
are
separable
in
a
case
such
as
mcdonald.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes,
justice
marshall.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
and
we
believe
that
the
result
would
be
the
same,
that
those
congregants
should
be
covered,
as
we
believe
shaare
tefila
would
be
covered.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
well,
again
swastikas
on
a
synagogue
again
invoke
that
ideology
of
racial
distinctness
of
jews,
and
we
think
if
that
is
part
of--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--well,
we
think
it
makes
no
difference
whether
the
jews
are
black
or
white
if
the
racial
animus
is
there
to
support
the
cause
of
action.
as
in
mcdonald
versus
jones,
the
court
hasn't
weighed
the
color
of
the
skin
or
the
race
of
the
victim
but
has
looked
to
the
intent
of
the
discriminator
and
that
the
result
there
should
be
the
same
even
if
the
victims
are
black.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
it
would
be
a
much
more
difficult
case.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
exactly.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
exactly,
if
there
weren't
some
evidence.
here
the
character
of
what
was
painted
is
the
strongest
evidence.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
we
might,
although
i
think
we
would
be
advocating,
as
are
the
respondents
in
the
st.
francis
college
case--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--no,
not
at
all,
justice
white.
we
want
to
urge
that
where
the
discrimination
against
them
is
racial,
even
though--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--there
is
some
evidence
of
that,
but
we
really
don't
think
that
is
critical
one
way
or
the
other
to
the
holding,
that
what
congress
was
after
and
was
concerned
about
was
racial
discrimination
against
anyone.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
no,
i
don't,
although
we
would
certainly
urge
the
court
to
make
clear
that
of
course
jews
or
any
other
group
now
bringing
a
claim
would
not
have
to
prove
some
racial
distinctness.
that
was
really
what
was
suggested
by
the
fourth
circuit
majority,
that
there
is
an
extra
burden
beyond
racial
motivation
on
the
plaintiff
to
show
that
they
are
non-white
or
racially
distinct,
although
it
is
unclear,
racially
distinct
from
whom.
that,
we
believe,
was
the
crux
of
the
error
and
that
particular
aspect
of
that
opinion,
we
believe
should
be
reversed
and
made
clear
by
the
court,
whether
or
not
the
court
accepts
the
racial
motivation
theory
that
we
have
put
forward
or
the
respondents'
approach
that
is
more
closely
tied
to
the
meaning
of
race
in
1866.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
we
believe
that
they
could.
in
fact,
they
were
prosecuted
under
state
law
only
under
the
malicious
destruction
of
property
types
of
statutes
that
don't
in
any
way
address
the
racial
motivation
or
the
real...
the
civil
rights
violation
that
was
the
most
hurtful
part
of
the
conduct.
it
wasn't
really
getting
the
wall
messed
up
that
is
offensive
to
the
congregation.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes,
i
do,
and
we--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--i
think
as
a
question
of
proof,
there
will
be
more,
or
less
easy
cases.
we
think
that
the
intent
here
is
very
clear,
and
that
the
right
that
was
violated
is
the
right
in
section
1982
to
hold
property,
one
of
the
specifically
enumerated
rights.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes,
it
would
certainly
be
a
question
of
fact.
but
we
believe
at
the
threshold
a
colorable
prosecution
could
be
brought.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
well,
as
in
the
court's
prior
cases,
considering
the
relationship
of
1981
in
title
vii
and
1982
in
title
viii,
they
are
separate
and
independent
causes
of
action
and
the
court
already
has
held
that
in
title
vii
and
title
viii,
congress
did
not
intend
to--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--well,
our
view
is
that
title
viii
has
its
restrictions
and
its
areas
of
coverage,
and
that
1982
has
its,
and
that
they
stand
independently.
it
may
well
be
that
there
are
cases
covered
under
section
1982
that
would
not
be
covered
under
title
viii.
in
fact,
this
is
such
a
case.
we
do
not
have
a
title
viii
claim
because
the
congregation
building
is
not
a
dwelling.
so,
the
two,
we
believe,
can
be
on
parallel
tracks
but
each
have
their
independent
areas
of
coverage
and
exemption.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
we
think
that
is
true
now,
justice
o'connor,
under
1982.
for
example,
if
a
black
family
is
now
denied
housing,
rental
housing
in
a
duplex,
there
is
no
reason
why
they
cannot
bring
a
section
1982
case
if
they
can
prove
that
discrimination,
you
know,
was
against
them
on
racial
grounds.
it's
really...
we're
not
going
any
farther
in
that
area
than
already
the
court
has
established,
that
there
are
areas
of
coverage
under
section
1982
that
might
be
exempted.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
well,
we
view
it
really
not
as
an
exemption,
but
as
reversing
the
fourth
circuit's
attempt
to
restrict
by
defining
groups
the
courts
think
are
not
racially
distinct
from
the
coverage
of
the
statute,
whereas
under
this
court's
cases,
particularly
general
building
contractors,
the
rule
has
been
where
there
is
racially
discriminatory
intent
to
breach
one
of
the
protected
rights
under
the
statute,
there
is
coverage.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
well,
title
viii,
as
i
recall,
also
covers
religious
discrimination.
it
also
covers,
i
believe,
gender
based
discrimination
which
our
theory
certainly
would
not
reach.
racial
motivation,
we
believe,
will
cover
victims
of
racial
motivation
but
in
a
straightforward
religious
discrimination
case,
for
example,
our
theory
would
not
cover
plaintiffs,
whereas
title
viii
very
well
right.
so
they
do
have,
we
believe,
their
independent
areas
of
coverage
and
exemption,
even
under
the
approach
we
urge.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
yes,
justice
scalia,
we
think
it
would
be,
and
in
fact
it's
those
kinds
of
stereotyped
generalizations
about
racial
groups
that
have
created
the
disabilities
that
congress
was
trying
to
break
in
the
1866
act.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
i
don't--
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
--if
it
isn't
a
racially
based
distinction,
we
think
that
case
would
not
be
covered.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
again,
harking
back
to
the
legislative
history
a
bit,
what
was
at
the
heart
of
the
reconstruction,
congress's
concern
of
course
in
the
first
instance
was
creating
situations
in
which
the
newly
freed
slaves
could
function
in
our
society.
but
they
didn't
limit
that
protection,
of
course,
just
to
blacks
as
the
court
held
in
mcdonald.
it
was
really
a
deep
concern
with
racial
motivation
as
being
something
distinct
and
particularly
odious
in
our
society
that
was
at
the
heart
of
their
concern.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
well,
perhaps,
justice
scalia,
it's
a
question
of
ignorance,
not
education.
i
think
that
there
are
perhaps
those
in
much
more
sophisticated
places
with
a
string
of
degrees
who
may
be
surprised
to
hear
a
congregation
arguing
before
the
supreme
court
that
jews
are
not
a
race.
we
believe
that
the
error
of
the
fourth
circuit
simply
was
in
not
applying
this
court's
precedents
in
mcdonald
and
general
building
contractors,
but
adding
on
that
extra
burden
an
extra
test
for
the
plaintiffs.
one
of
the
additional
difficulties
with
that
test
is
that
it
simply
is
not
practicable
and
sensible
for
the
district
courts
to
be
trying
to
figure
out
who
is
racially
distinct
or
non-white,
which
are
the
words
the
fourth
circuit
used.
it
is
unclear,
first
of
all,
what
the
court
even
meant
by
"racially
distinct".
racially
distinct
from
whom?
in
sullivan
and
tillman,
this
court
held
that
even
whites
who
are
the
victims
of
racial
discrimination
by
other
whites,
because
those
white
plaintiffs
have
advocated
the
rights
of
blacks,
have
a
cause
of
action
under
sections
1981
and
1982.
and
we
believe,
again,
the
principle
that
underlies
that
case
is
if
the
motivation
is
racial,
it's
racial
because
those
white
plaintiffs
were
advocating
the
rights
of
blacks,
that
once
again
there
should
be
a
cause
of
action
even
if
the
plaintiffs
and
defendants
are
of
the
same
race,
indisputably.
in
terms,
of
course,
of
its
language
about
the
jewish
plaintiffs
in
shaare
tefila
being
non-white,
we
think
perhaps
it
goes
without
saying
that
it
would
be
completely
inappropriate
exercise
for
the
district
courts
to
undertake
trying
to
figure
out
who
is
white
and
non-white
in
some
objective,
anthropological
or
scientific
test,
that
that
simply
would
not
be
an
appropriate
approach
for
the
courts
to
take.
for
all
of
these
reasons
we
respectfully
ask
this
court
to
reverse
and
to
hold
that
all
victims
of
racially
motivated
deprivations
of
the
rights
enumerated
in
the
civil
rights
acts
of
1866
may
state
a
cause
of
action
under
sections
1981
and
1982.
ms.
patricia
a.
brannan
may
it
please
the
court,
if
i
could
just
briefly
address
the
issue
that
arose
during
mrs.
garren's
argument
about
commonness
of
the
perception
of
jews
and
whether
this
is
a
deviant
belief,
first
of
all,
as
judge
wilkinson
pointed
out
in
dissent
below,
there
was
no
record
on
the
commonness
of
the
belief
because
we
were
cut
off
on
a
motion
to
dismiss
in
which
the
district
court
didn't
even
consider
the
extra
pleading
material
that
we
put
in
the
record.
but
secondly,
that
i
think
that
some
gallup
poll
or
test
of
the
prevalence
of
the
view
really
doesn't
solve
the
problem.
the
facts
of
this
case
show
that
this
kind
of
conduct
occurs.
it
is
not
unique
to
shaare
tefila,
and
where
it
occurs,
regardless
of
the
prevalence
or
whether
we
characterize
it
as
deviant,
which
i
hope
we
all
would,
that
the
harm
is
the
same.
it
is
a
harm
based
on
racially
motivated
conduct
and
it
should
be
redressed
under
section
1982.
