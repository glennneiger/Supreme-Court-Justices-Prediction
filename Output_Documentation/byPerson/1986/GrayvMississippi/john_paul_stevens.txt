paul

what
are
you
assuming,
that
he
gets
one
peremptory
back
or
all
five,
when
you're
in
this
debate?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
must
confess,
i
really
don't
understand
this
part
of
the
argument,
because
no
matter
whether
the
trial
judge
was
right
or
wrong,
the
state
did
elect
to
use
its
peremptories.
if
he
did
not
believe
the
jurors
and
he
thought
they
could
have
sat
legitimately,
the
only
way
the
prosecutor
could
get
him
off
was
by-using
a
peremptory.
so
on
that
hypothesis
they
had
to
use
the
peremptory,
right?
and
on
the
other
hand,
if
they
were
telling
the
truth
they
were
qualified
and
the
only
way
the
prosecutor
could
get
them
off
was
to
use
a
peremptory.
justice
john
paul
stevens
so
i
don't
understand
how
there's
even
an
arguable
basis
for
saying
the
prosecutor
wouldn't
have
used
his
peremptories.
he
had
to,
no
matter
what
your
theory
is.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
he
did
use
them
and
that's--
justice
john
paul
stevens
general
white,
i
was
just
reading
over
again
the
colloquy.
it's
really
puzzling.
but
when
the
judge
says
"oh,
i
think
there
are
one
or
two
that
just
used
this
to
get
off
of
the
jury,
at
least
one
person
that
i'm
positive
of.
"
do
you
think
that's
the
equivalent
of
a
finding
of
fact,
that
there
was
one
of
these
that
was
excused
that
the
state
had
to
use
a
peremptory
on
that
was
guilty
of
perjury?
justice
john
paul
stevens
see,
it's
conceivable
that
they
might
have
been
very
happy
to
get
off
the
jury
because
of
this,
and
they
may
have
perhaps
just
emphasized,
given
more
emphatic
answers
or
something.
i
don't
know
just
how
to
interpret
that
statement.
justice
john
paul
stevens
doesn't
it
have
to
be
part
of
your
case
that
he
says
at
least
as
with
respect
to
one,
because
he
says
at
least
one
person
that
i'm
positive
of,
that
that's
pretty
much
the
equivalent
of
saying
i
think
that
prospective
juror
was
lying?
justice
john
paul
stevens
would
that
gut
feeling
be
adequate
to
justify
excusing
him
for
cause
without
finding
that
he
was
not
telling
the
truth?
justice
john
paul
stevens
did
the
state,
with
respect...
and
we
don't
know
which
juror
this
is.
but
with
respect
to
any
of
these,
before
using
its
peremptory
did
the
state
support
a
motion
to
excuse
for
cause
on
the
ground
that
this
juror
is
not
believable,
i
think
he's
just
trying
to
get
out
of
jury
duty?
justice
john
paul
stevens
no,
no,
no.
the
earlier
ones,
the
earlier
ones,
when
the
state
was--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--so
that
the
notion
that
the
judge
was
too
tough
on
the
state
and
perhaps
should
have
granted
the
motions
for
cause
really
arises
during
the
colloquy
about
mrs.
bounds
for
the
first
time?
justice
john
paul
stevens
can
i
ask
you.
i
must
confess
this
case
confuses
me.
every
time
i
look
at
it
i
seem
to
see
it
differently.
but
on
page
49
of
the
joint
appendix,
in
the
mississippi
supreme
court's
discussion
of
the
case
they
point
out
that
the
trial
judge
refused
to
excuse
there
jurors
and
required
the
state
to
exercise
peremptory
challenges.
and
it
says:
"it
is
abundantly
clear
from
the
record
that
his
reason
for
doing
so
was
because
he
believed
that
the
jurors
were
simply
claiming
to
have
conscientious
scruples
against
the
death
penalty.
"
and
so
forth.
should
we...
what
if
we
were
to
take
that
as
a
finding
of
fact
that
all
of
those,
the
judge
correctly
concluded
that
those
jurors
were
shading
their
testimony
or
lying?
if
that
were
true,
then
would
it
not
also
follow
that
the
trial
judge
correctly
required
the
state
to
exercise
its
peremptories?
