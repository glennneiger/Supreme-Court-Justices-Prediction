mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
the
court's
decision
in
this
case,
whether
it
be
based
on
a
legal
error,
a
narrow
constitutional
holding,
or
a
very
broad
constitutional
holding,
must
be
based
on
an
understanding
of
the
sequence
of
events
of
voir
dire--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--right
out
of
the
box.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
that's
in
essence
what
i
meant
with
the
legal
error.
that
ground...
if
the
court
will
recall,
the
basis
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
had
for
finding
this
error
harmless
was
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
said
the
trial
judge
had
erred
in
previous
rulings.
the
mississippi
supreme
court
also
went
on
to
find
that
the
trial
judge
had
made
his
previous
witherspoon
rulings
based
on
the
trial
judge's
belief
that
the
jurors
weren't
being
sincere
with
him
when
they
said
that
they
had
scruples
that
would
prevent
their
being
seated
in
the
case.
in
finding
that
the
trial
judge
didn't
believe
them
and
then
going
on
to
say,
well,
they
shouldn't
have
been
excused,
the
mississippi
supreme
court
misunderstood
witt.
i
think
to
make
sense
witt
has
to
be
read
to
mean
that
jurors
should
only
be
excused
if
they
honestly
maintain
scruples
that
prevent
or
substantially
impair
them.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
don't
want
to
argue
with
the
court
about
whether
it
should
be
legal
or
constitutional.
i
think
what
mississippi
did
is
misunderstand
witt
in
that
one
respect,
and
i
think
without
going
into
a
very
broad
analysis
of
davis
this
court
can
say:
you
misunderstood
witt;
if
the
trial
court
did
not
believe
those
earlier
jurors,
he
wasn't
wrong,
and
therefore
we
don't
even
get
to
this
offsetting
penalties
concept.
this
court
also
must
recognize,
in
reaching
its
conclusion,
the
clear
distinction
between
the
jury
function
of
fact
finding
in
the
guilt-innocence
phase
and
the
discretionary
function
involved
in
determining
whether
a
particular
community,
a
particular
community,
believes
that
the
appropriate
sentence
in
a
particular
case
is
death.
the
voir
dire
in
this
case
was
an
alternating
type
voir
dire.
it
didn't
alternate
on
each
particular
juror,
but
alternated
on
the
panels.
to
start
with,
twelve
jurors
were
seated,
they
were
questioned
by
the
prosecutor.
he
exercised
some
peremptory
challenges,
one
juror
was
excused
for
cause.
they
were
replaced.
the
prosecutor
stayed
on
his
feet,
questioned
again
until
he
was
satisfied
with
the
twelve
in
the
box.
they
were
then
passed
over
to
the
defense
lawyer.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
believe
it
is,
although
my
experience
is--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--i'm
from
new
hampshire,
your
honor.
from
my
understanding,
it
is
commonly
followed.
the
defense
would
then
question.
then
any
replacement
jurors
would
be
requestioned
by
the
prosecutor.
the
important
thing
is
that
the
jurors
were
questioned
in
each
other's
presence.
the
jurors
in
the
box,
as
well
as
the
jurors
waiting
to
be
seated
in
the
audience,
could
hear
the
questions,
the
answers,
the
motions,
the
rulings,
and
the
ramifications
of
the
rulings.
each
side
in
mississippi
had
twelve
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
believe
they
can.
i
believe
there's
also
a
motion
for
sequestered
individual
voir
dire,
where
each
juror
is
brought
in
singly.
but
that
is
discretionary.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i'm
sorry?
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
no,
your
honor.
and
certainly,
when
the
problems
developed
the
prosecutor
didn't
ask
in
the
middle
of
the
proceedings
to
change
the
procedure.
there
were
ten
motions
made
for
cause
by
the
prosecutor
related
to
witherspoon
grounds.
the
first
eight
were
denied.
each
of
those
jurors
were
then
struck
by
a
peremptory
challenge
by
the
prosecutor.
the
ninth
cause
challenge
based
on
witherspoon
grounds
was
granted.
it
was
against
a
juror
named
schleh.
this
is
at
pages
503
to
506
of
the
transcript.
it
happens
at
a
time
when
the
prosecutor
still
has
peremptory
challenges
remaining.
the
tenth
juror
was
mrs.
bounds,
who
was
excused
over
complaints
by
the
defense
counsel
that
she
was
qualified
to
sit.
mrs.
bounds'
voir
dire
begins
at
529
and
530
of
the
trial
record,
which
is
just
a
little
bit
before
what
you
have
in
your
joint
appendix.
it
starts
with
the
judge
asking
mrs.
bounds
two
questions:
"do
you
know
of
any
reason
you
couldn't
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror,
mrs.
bounds?
"
"no,
sir".
"do
you
think
you
meet
all
the
tests
to
be
a
fair
and
impartial
juror?
"
"i'll
try".
we
then
go
on
to
the
prosecutor's
questioning.
he
asked
her
a
few
questions
about
pretrial
publicity,
and
then
he
goes
on--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--well--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--it's
not
quite
a
yes,
but
i
think
you'll
see
later
on
that
she's
been
listening
to
this
judge
say,
would
you
automatically
vote
against
the
death
penalty
regardless
of
the
evidence.
her
response
to
that
is:
"i
will
listen".
so
i
think
in
context,
she's
saying
she'll
do
the
best
she
can.
her
answers--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--excuse
me?
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
well,
any
ambiguity
on
whether
she
can
do
the
job
or
not,
whether
she's
qualified
or
not,
is
cleared
up
later
in
the
record,
and
i
don't
think
there's
a
problem
with
that.
the
prosecutor
asks
her:
"do
you
have
any
conscientious
scruples
against
capital
punishment
when
imposed
by
law?
"
her
response
at
the
outset
is:
"i
don't
know".
"well,
i
don't
know
either.
"
says
the
prosecutor.
he
says
he
knows
how
he
feels,
and
then
he
goes
on
and
tells
her
he's
trying
to
find
twelve
people
without
conscientious
scruples
to
sit
on
the
case.
that
may
be
a
proper
purpose
for
him.
it
wasn't
a
proper
ground
for
excluding
her.
the
trial
judge
then
intercedes
on
the
prosecutor's
request.
he
asks
four
or
five
different
times,
would
you
automatically
vote
against
the
imposition
of
the
death
penalty
without
regard
to
any
evidence
that
might
be
developed
in
the
trial
of
the
case?
mrs.
bounds
at
first
says:
"i
would
try
to
listen".
and
then
later,
when
he
says
"no,
answer
it
yes
or
no.
"
she
says:
"no,
i
would
not
automatically
vote
against.
"
in
the
course
of
this
questioning,
i
think
it's
appropriate
to
note
the
court
makes
a
statement
in
the
nature
of
a
factual
finding
about
mrs.
bounds'
credibility.
he
says:
18
of
the
joint
appendix.
later
on,
a
couple
pages
later,
he
goes
on
and
says:
"mrs.
bounds,
you're
honest
and
sincere.
"
so
he
repeats
the
same
finding.
after
this
series
of
questions,
the
prosecutor
asks
mrs.
bounds:
"what
would
you
do
in
this
case?
"
"could
you
send
this
man
here
to
the
gas
chamber?
"
and
she
says:
"i
don't
think
i
could",
which,
if
it
ended
there,
would
probably
disqualify
her.
but
it
doesn't
end
there.
there's
a
motion
to
strike
for
cause.
the
judge
tells
us
what
his
assessment
is
of
her
ability
to
be
seated
at
this
point,
and
he
tells
us:
"i
don't
know
whether
she
could
vote
for
it,
i
don't
know
whether
she
couldn't.
"
"she
told
me
she
could
just
a
while
ago.
"
that's
at
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix.
at
this
point
the
prosecutor
has
not
carried
his
burden
of
proof
as
an
adversary
seeking
excusal
of
a
juror.
the
judge
isn't
convinced
that
she
cannot
properly
sit.
there's
a
brief
exchange
regarding
the
prosecutor's
precarious
position,
some
more
questioning
by
the
judge.
mrs.
bounds
says:
"i
think
i
could
vote
for
the
death
penalty.
"
the
prosecutor
then
makes
another
motion.
this
time
it's
not
a
motion
to
strike,
it's
a
motion
to
reverse
some
of
those
prior
rulings
that
your
honor
had
asked
about.
there's
a
give
and
take
at
the
bench
and
the
trial
court
says:
"go
ask
her
if
she
could
vote
guilty
or
not
guilty.
"
"if
she
gets
to
equivocating
on
that,
guilty
or
not
guilty,
i'm
going
to
let
her
off
as
a
person
who
can't
make
up
her
mind.
"
well,
the
prosecutor
goes
out
and
asks
her:
"could
you
reach
a
verdict"?
"yes,
i
could".
"if
the
verdict
is
guilty,
could
you
vote
for
the
death
penalty?
"
"yes".
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
certainly--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--that
would
have
been
a
certain
way
out
of
this
quagmire.
i
guess
the
court's
question
presumes
that
this
trial
judge
believed
that
he
had
erred
five
times
previously.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
that
he
had
indeed
erred
previously
with
respect
to
the
five
early
jurors.
i'm
not
so
sure
that
that's
the
case.
if
indeed
he
felt
that
way,
he
could
have
reversed
his
earlier
rulings
and
given
this
defense
lawyer
a
chance
to
rehabilitate
the
jurors,
which
because
of
the
nature
of
the
way
this
voir
dire
happened,
the
defense
lawyer
never
asked
the
excused
jurors
any
questions.
but
be
that
as
it
may,
i
think
the
easiest
way
out
of
this
would
have
been
to
throw
the
whole
panel
out...
they
were
all
infected
with
the
questioning
and
attempts
to
get
off
the
jury...
and
start
anew.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
no,
i
was
not.
all
nine
members
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
found
that
it
was
error
to
excuse
mrs.
bounds
for
cause.
to
paraphrase
adams,
it
does
not
appear
in
the
record
that
mrs.
bounds
was
so
irrevocably
opposed
to
capital
punishment
as
to
frustrate
the
state's
legitimate
effort
to
administer
the
death
penalty.
she
at
the
end
very
clearly
said,
i
could
reach
a
verdict
and
i
could
impose
the
death
penalty.
one
other
thing
i
would
point
out,
we
do
not
have
in
this
case
the
ping-pong
effect
that
mr.
justice
powell
described
in
patton.
that's
where
the
prosecutor
gets
up
and
asks
a
bunch
of
leading
questions
of
an
unprepared
lay
juror
and
smacks
her
in
one
direction,
and
then
the
defense
lawyer
does
the
same
thing
and
smacks
her
back,
and
then
the
judge
has
to
decide
which
set
of
leading
responses
is
true.
mr.
stegall,
the
defense
lawyer
at
trial,
never
asked
mrs.
bounds
any
questions
at
all.
so
we
have
the
prosecutor
asking
confusing
and
sometimes
leading
questions
on
the
one
hand,
and
then
we
have
the
trial
judge
asking
open-ended
questions
that
get
responses
that
qualify
her
to
sit.
and
at
the
very
end,
it's
even
the
prosecutor
who
asks:
"can
you
reach
a
verdict"?
"yes".
"can
you
vote
for
the
death
penalty?
"
i
think
it's
pretty
clear
that
mrs.
bounds
was
erroneously
excused.
having
found
that,
the
majority
of
the
mississippi
supreme
court
then
went
on
to
its
rationale
about
why
the
error
was
harmless.
the
rationale
used
this
offsetting
penalties
approach.
that
is,
you
erred
against
the
state
by
denying
their
motions,
therefore
it's
okay
to
err
against
the
defense.
jurors
are
certainly
not
fungible
commodities
where
this
kind
of
tit
for
tat
approach
is
appropriate.
each
juror
brings
something
with
him
or
with
her.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
number
one,
i'm
not
clear
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
quite
spelled
it
out,
but
that
was
my
impression,
as
is
yours.
but
when
i
saw
the
respondent's
brief,
what
you're
describing
is
basically
an
unused
peremptory's
rendering
an
error
harmless.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
the
respondent
in
this
case
in
their
brief
at
25
seems
to
distinguish
the
instant
matter
from
an
unused
peremptories
issue
by
saying
that
they
would
have,
if
they
could.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
think
that's
the
problem
with
the
unused
peremptories
argument.
i
think
when
you
consider
how
voir
dire
is
conducted,
you
have
a
trial
lawyer
who's
focused
on
a
juror,
getting
at
questions
and
answers,
trying
to
determine
demeanor,
trying
to
determine
how
this
juror
will
fit
in
with
those,
as
well
as
individually,
trying
to
figure
out
what
the
other
side's
going
to
do
with
this
juror,
and
then
trying
to
calculate
what's
going
to
happen
behind
him.
i
think
that,
even
not
doubting
a
prosecutor's
sincerity,
the
nature
of
the
situation
changes
from
moment
to
moment
to
moment.
i
think
it
is--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
agree.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
think
the
nature
of
her
responses
changed
dramatically
from
the
very
front
to
the
very
end.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
well,
i'm
not
100
percent
sure
that
he
would
have
used
them
there,
and
you've
said
that
100
percent
sure--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--you
bet,
you
bet.
the
other
issue,
the
other
way
to
look
at
this--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--i
don't
know
how
we
tell.
the
trial
judge
clearly
excused
these
people
or
clearly
refused
to
excuse
these
people.
i
don't
know
how
we
parse
out
whether
one
comes
back
or
five
come
back.
i
think
it's
speculation
on
this
record
that
the
trial
judge
believes
he
committed
an
error.
i
don't
think
he
quite
believes
that.
so
i
can't
tell.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
think
in
that
circumstance,
your
honor,
you
have
to
look
at
judge
goldberg's
concurrence,
where
he
talks
about
not
only
the
impact
of
the
erroneous
ruling
as
to
juror
x,
but
the
impact
of
the
erroneous
ruling
as
to
the
rest
of
the
panel.
i
think
that
having
a
pocket
full
of
peremptories,
as
opposed
to
a
few--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--i
think
there's
a
problem
with
it.
the
problem
is...
and
it
happened
here.
this
trial
judge
refused
to
excuse
these
jurors.
because
of
his
ruling,
the
defense
lawyer
made
no
attempt
to
question
the
jurors,
rehabilitate
the
jurors,
or
whatever.
if
we
were
in
a
situation,
as
your
honor
poses,
where
we're
down
to
the
last
person
and
the
response
from
the
juror
is,
i
could
vote
for
a
death
penalty,
what's
the
defense
lawyer
supposed
to
ask
her
to
make
her
position
any
more
clear?
i
think
it
presents
problems
in
that
procedural
context.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
right.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
i
think
he
would
have
used
them.
i
think--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--yes,
i
agree,
i
agree.
there
is
some
discussion
by
the
respondent
and
the
amici
that
this
case
is
governed
by
lockhart
and
that
because
of
lockhart
jurors
with
scruples
don't
comprise
a
recognized
group.
just
very
briefly,
i
think
lockhart
makes
it
very
clear
that
there
is
a
special
context
for
capital
sentencing.
the
jury's
function
in
capital
sentencing
is
not
the
very
strictly
channeled
fact
finding
of
guilt
or
innocence.
i
think
it's
discretionary.
it
involves
representation
of
that
community's
beliefs,
perhaps
moral
outrage,
perhaps
mercy.
it's
based
on
the
weighing
of
factors
that
an
appellate
court
can't
go
back
and
say
this
weighing
was
appropriate.
how
can
we
compare
age
of
a
defendant
versus
the
way
the
crime
was
committed?
it
simply
isn't...
it
isn't
something
that
can
be
replicated
or
even
viewed
critically
by
an
appellate
court.
this
court
in
the
bobby
caldwell
case
talked
about
the
appellate
court's
inability
to
glean
from
the
record
the
intangibles
of
a
jury's
decision
to
sentence
to
death
or
not
to
sentence
to
death.
i
think
those
comments
are
quite
appropriate
here
in
this
case.
the
only
other
point
i
would
touch
on
is,
there
is
some
argument
by
the
amici
and
the
respondent
that
this
court
has
already
used
a
harmless
error
standard
in
death
penalty
cases
in
the
context
of
zant
versus
stephens.
that
case
in
part
is
completely
distinguishable
from
this
case;
in
part,
it
supports
petitioner's
position.
very
briefly,
you
have
to
look
to
the
metaphor
used
by
the
georgia
supreme
court,
which
involved
the
pyramid
and
the
narrowing
effect
of
the
jury
selection,
of
the
jury
selection
of
who
is
eligible
and
then
who
deserves
the
death
penalty.
the
function
of
aggravating
factors
in
georgia
was
simply
to
see
which
defendants
were
death
eligible.
therefore,
the
finding
of
one
or
ten
aggravating
factors
was
no
different.
any
one
beyond
the
first
was
a
redundancy.
in
a
case
like
this,
in
this
instance,
where
mississippi
requires
a
unanimous
verdict,
a
decision
to
improperly
excuse
one
juror
cannot
be
considered
a
redundancy.
she
could
have
been
the
juror
that
saved
mr.
gray's
life.
a
failure
to
reach
a
unanimous
verdict
results
in
a
life
sentence.
the
other
point,
just
to
go
back
to
mr.
justice
scalia's
question
about
100
percent
versus
very
likely
versus
the
harmless
error,
which
is
a
reasonable
possibility
that
it
couldn't
affect
this
verdict,
i
would
submit
that
it's
the
prosecutor,
the
state,
the
respondent,
who
must
establish
harmless
error
beyond
a
reasonable
doubt
in
this
kind
of
an
error.
we're
not
dealing
with
something
like
defective
assistance
of
counsel,
where
the
prosecutor
can't
control
what
happens.
clearly,
this
prosecutor
did
control
what
happened.
he
did
not
need
to...
he
didn't
have
to
stand
on
his
motion.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
this
is
distinguishable
from
the
strickland
scenario,
where
the
prosecutor
can't
prevent
the
error
because
he
doesn't
control
what
the
defense
lawyer
does.
in
this
situation,
the
prosecutor
formed
the
questions,
he
made
the
motions.
he
didn't
have
to
continue
to
press
the
trial
judge
to
excuse
this
juror.
he
could
have
said:
yes,
she
can
vote
for
a
guilty
verdict;
yes,
she
can
vote
for
death'
i
withdraw
my
motion.
it
was
within
his
power,
is
what
i'm
saying,
as
opposed
to
the
ineffectiveness
claim,
where
the
defense
properly
bears
the
burden.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
that
presumes
that
he
has
a
right
not
to
have
this
juror
seated.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
he
didn't
have
that
right
under
these
circumstances.
i
didn't
expect
the
court
not
to
have
very
many
questions.
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
portion
of
the
remaining
time
if
the
court
doesn't
have
further
questions.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
thank
you.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
thank
you,
your
honor.
just
very
briefly,
i'd
like
to
go
back
to
the
point
of
whether
or
not
the
five
jurors
were
erroneously
stricken.
looking
at
the
mississippi
supreme
court
opinion
that
deals
with
this
issue,
maybe
i'll
confuse
it
more,
but
i'll
take
my
try.
justice
dan
lee
at
47
starts
discussing
the
problem
with
the
excusal,
and
he
goes
through
this
dissertation
about
the
twelve
angry
men
and
how
jurors
are
often
reluctant
to
serve,
and
really
capsulizes
the
problem.
he
then
talks
about
how
voir
dire
should
have
been
done
by
the
trial
judge.
and
then
on
page
49
he
discusses
that
it
is
abundantly
clear
from
the
record
that
the
trial
court
refused
to
strike
because
he
believed
them
insincere.
after
that,
there
is
never
a
finding
that
the
trial
court
was
wrong
in
believing
them
insincere.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
it's
correct
the
erroneous
ruling
if
you
misunderstand
witt,
and
i
think
that's
what
happened
with
the
mississippi
supreme
court.
if
this
trial
judge
didn't
believe
the
attestations
of
the
jurors,
they
shouldn't
have
been
excused.
and
i
think
this
court,
this
state
supreme
court,
doesn't
argue
with
the--
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
--i
guess
my
concern
is
that
this
record
doesn't
support
your
interpretation.
this
trial
judge
at
the
very
end
of
the
colloque
that
we've
been
talking
about
at
the
trial
is
given
a
very
clear
chance
on
a
motion
of
the
prosecutor
to
reverse
the
five
earlier
rulings.
and
he
says
at
the
very,
very
end,
he
says,
i
am
not
going
to
do
it,
i'm
not
going
to
go
back
and
give
him
five
more.
he
refuses
affirmatively,
affirmatively
refuses
to
go
back
and
change
his
earlier
rulings.
this
trial
judge
did
not
correct
prior
rulings
because
he
didn't
change
them.
i
would
also
argue
that
his
excusal
of
mrs.
schleh
on
cause
grounds
showed
that
he
knew
how
to...
he
knew
what
witherspoon
was
about
and
could
apply
it
when
he
thought
the
jurors
were
sincere
and
could
refuse
to
apply
it
when
the
jurors
were
insincere.
additionally,
there
are
a
number
of
places
in
the
record
where
the
trial
judge
and
the
prosecutor
talk
about
jurors
using
this
as
an
excuse
to
get
off
the
jury.
the
prosecutor
asked
mr.
lassabe:
"do
you
believe
that
or
are
you
just
telling
me
that
to
get
off
the
jury?
"
i
think
it
was
a
clear
problem,
a
problem
that
could
have
been
corrected
as
soon
as
it
raised
its
head
by
stopping,
excusing
everyone
else,
and
going
to
an
individual
voir
dire.
but
once
we
got
to
mrs.
bounds,
i
think
justice
blackmun
is
absolutely
correct,
the
only
way
to
fix
the
problem
is
to
throw
everyone
out
and
start
over
again.
just
as
a
matter
of
record,
this
wasn't
a
special
venire.
this
was
the
regular
venire
that
was
summoned
here.
the
prosecutor...
the
judge
had
talked
the
defense
lawyer
out
of
a
special
venire
because
you
had
to
tell
the
jurors
that
they
were
being
summoned
for
a
capital
case,
state
versus
david
gray,
and
they
all
agreed
that
they
didn't
want
jurors
looking
out
for
the
david
gray
publicity.
so
this
was
just
the
regular
venire
of
a
couple
hundred
people.
mr.
andru
h.
volinsky
thank
you,
your
honor.
