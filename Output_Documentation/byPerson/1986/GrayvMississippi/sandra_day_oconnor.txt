mr.
volinsky,
if
we
had
a
case
where
all
the
other
eleven
jurors
had
been
selected
at
the
time
a
mrs.
bounds
was
examined
and
the
state
still
had
ten
peremptory
challenges
left
and
the
trial
judge
is
convinced
from
the
testimony
of
the
prosecutor
that
indeed
the
prosecutor
would
have
used
one
of
them
on
mrs.
bounds,
could
we
have
a
harmless
error
inquiry?
justice

o'connor
well,
on
the
facts
that
i
pose,
in
your
view
could
we
have
a
harmless
error
inquiry
perhaps?

the

possibly?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
white,
if
the
state
had
no
peremptory
challenges
left
and
there
was
no
question
that
earlier
jurors
had
been
properly
excused...
assume
that
it's
not
the
facts
that
you
are
alleging
here...
and
the
state
had
no
peremptories
left
at
the
time
that
mrs.
bounds
or
someone
like
her
is
erroneously
excused
for
cause,
would
you
still
urge
a
harmless
error
inquiry?
