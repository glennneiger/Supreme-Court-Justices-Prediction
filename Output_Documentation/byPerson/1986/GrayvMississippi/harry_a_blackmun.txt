justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
the
standard
mississippi
procedure?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you're
from
new
hampshire.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
can't
counsel
move
that
the
waiting
members
of
the
panel
be
taken
out
of
the
courtroom?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
such
motion
was
made
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
no
such
motion
was
made
here.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
mr.
volinsky,
i
suppose
the
trial
judge
messed
up
the
whole
thing,
didn't
he?
i
guess
we'll
all
agree
to
that.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
what
do
you
think
he
should
have
done
at
the
time
this
long
exchange,
which
we're
all
familiar
with,
i
might
say,
with
mrs.
bounds
was
concluded?
should
he
have
started
all
over
again,
dismissed
the
panel
and
started
all
over
again?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
say
it
again,
that
this
trial
judge
believed
what?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
were
you
of
counsel
below?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
how
do
we
know
that
they
would
have?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
of
course,
the
trial
court
never
made
a
finding
to
that
effect,
did
he?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
then
i'll
ask
you
what
i
asked
your
opposing
counsel:
what
should
the
trial
judge
have
done
in
order
to
clean
up
this
mess
that
he
created?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
white,
let
me
ask
you,
too,
about
mississippi
procedures.
is
this
case
typical
of
the
jury
selection
procedure
in
mississippi?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
is
that
similar
to
alabama
and
louisiana,
tennessee?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
it
seems
very
strange
to
me,
an
unusual
kind
of
a
way.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
mr.
white,
let
me
follow
up
on
justice
scalia's
question.
is
it
mississippi
law
that
the
trial
judge
in
his
discretion
may
go
beyond
the
statute
and
allow
as
many
additional
peremptories
to
the
state
as
he
sees
fit?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
you
have
no
cases
on
that?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
one
last
question.
where
is
harrison
county?
is
that
jackson?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
not
a
small
rural
county?
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
yes,
but
he
might
have
used
the
peremptories
if
he
had
had
them
at
hand.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
well,
maybe
his
concern
was
less
with
them
than
with
mrs.
bounds.
but
if
he
had
had
the
peremptory
he
might
have
used
it
anyway.
justice
harry
a.
blackmun
so
it's
all
speculation
that
we're
dealing
with.
