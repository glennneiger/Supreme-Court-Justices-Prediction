mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
this
case
the
mississippi
supreme
court
held
that
the
force
and
effect
of
the
trial
court's
ruling
in
this
case
was
to
correct
an
error
that
he
had
committed
in
refusing
to
dismiss
other
jurors
for
cause
after
they
had
unequivocally
stated
that
they
could
not
vote
to
impose
the
death
penalty
in
any
circumstance.
the
court
further
held--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
think
the
trial
court
said
that,
in
the
paragraph
where
the
trial
court
is
talking
about
that,
he
said:
i
have
cheated
the
state
out
of
this.
and
i
think
that
is
a
finding.
it
says
the
court
is
of
the
opinion...
and
that's
on
page
26
of
the
joint
appendix:
"the
court
is
of
the
opinion
that
it
cheated
the
state
by
making
him
use...
by
making
the
district
attorney
use
his
peremptory
challenges
in
at
least
five
instances,
and
i'm
going
to
allow
them
in
this
particular
case.
"
so
i
think
the
trial
court
is
clearly
recognizing
his
error
there,
that
he
has
made
a
mess,
as
he
said
himself,
and
created
this
situation
that
we
have
a
juror
who,
he
says
in
his
findings
of
fact,
also
that
she
can't
make
up
her
mind.
he
has
a
totally
indecisive
juror.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
he
probably
should
have
used
the
word
"peremptory"
instead
of
"cause"
there,
and
i
think
that's
probably
what
he
meant
to
say.
but
he
used
the
term
"cause"
and,
if
you
read
prior
to
that,
in
a
couple
of
paragraphs
prior
to
that,
he
got
the
terms
"peremptory"
and
"cause"
confused
there.
and
i
think
the
judge
fully
meant
to
use
the
word
"peremptory"
instead
of
"cause".
but
we
have
this
situation
here
where
he
used
the
word
"cause"
and
things
moved
on.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
he
says,
i'm
not
going
to
give
you
five
more.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
and
i
think
he
was
backing
off
and
excusing
her
because
she
was
indecisive
in
her
answers
and
he
was
not
satisfied
that
she
was
in
fact
rehabilitated
and
everything
else,
and
was
saying
there
that
he
was
going
to
excuse
for
cause.
the
mississippi
supreme
court,
of
course,
looking
at
this
situation,
decided
that
this
was
a
case
in
which
they
had
to
step
in
and
define
what
the
trial
judge
meant
or
decide
what
the
trial
judge
meant.
and
we
find
there
that
they
did.
they
said
he
properly
did
what
he
did,
instead
of
dismissing
this
whole
venire
and
starting
over
again
at
this
point.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
pretty
much
typical.
what
we
do
in
mississippi,
we
put
twelve
people
in
the
box
and
then
the
voir
dire
starts.
and
the
challenges
are
exercised,
and
the
state
has
to
present
the
defense
with
twelve
jurors
in
the
box
that
we
accept,
and
then
the
defense
can
voir
dire
them
and
then
remove
those.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i'm
not
familiar
with
their
practice--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--it's
called
the
stennis
method
of
jury
selection,
and
it's
name
after
senator
stennis.
when
he
was
circuit
judge,
it
started
then.
and
it
has
been
approved
in
the
federal
courts
in
gray
v.
mississippi,
the
non
sequestered
voir
dire.
and
there
is
no
provision,
and
it
has
been
consistently
held
that
there
is
no
entitlement
to,
a
sequestered
voir
dire
in
this
case.
it's
discretionary
with
the
judge,
of
course.
so
in
looking
at
this,
there
are
five
jurors
in
this
case
that
do
not
equivocate
in
the
least
in
their
opposition
to
the
death
penalty.
and
the
judge...
something
the
defense
counsel
has
skipped
over
here
is
when
the
judge
talks
about,
and
he
says:
"i'm
in
a
precarious
position
by
making
the
state
use
its
challenges
when
we
clearly
have
met
the
law
in
about
six
cases.
"
"well,
i
think
i
had
one
or
two
that
just
used
this
to
get
off
the
jury,
at
least
one
person
that
i'm
positive
of.
"
that's
on
page
20
of
the
joint
appendix.
so
the
judge
is
not
saying
that
all
of
these
people
were
using
this
to
just
get
off
the
jury.
he
said,
i've
got
one
or
two,
and
one
that
i'm
positive
of.
so
it
is
not
conclusive
that
he
was
removing
these
jurors
just
because
he
was
thinking
that
they
were
just
using
it
to
get
off
the
jury.
what
he
was
doing
was
trying
to
insulate
this
case
from
witherspoon
error.
so,
because
it
is
clear
that
if
you
use
a
peremptory
that
there
is
no
question
there
is
no
witherspoon
problem.
and
by
forcing
the
state...
when
he
uses
the
first
one,
when
he
requires
the
state
to
use
the
peremptory
on
the
first
challenge,
to
mr.
ruiz:
"we
would
like
to
use
one
of
our
challenges
at
this
time.
"
"well,
i'm
not
going
to
excuse
him
for
cause.
"
"you'll
have
to
use
one
of
your
challenges.
"
in
one
of
the
others,
he
just...
"i
guess",
the
judge
says,
"you're
going
to
use
one
of
your
peremptories.
"
he
just
tells
the
state
when
they
move
for
cause.
he
says
no,
use
a
peremptory.
so
the
state
was
forced
to
use
peremptories
in
those
five
cases.
there
are
three
jurors
there
that
they
used
peremptories
on
that
are
in
the
joint
appendix,
and
of
course
those
are
clearly
jurors
that
that
was
the
proper
use
of
a
peremptory,
for
the
use
of
a
peremptory.
so
we
have
a
trial
record,
of
course,
that
is
very
confusing,
and
this
confusion,
we
submit,
is
cleared
up
by
the
mississippi
supreme
court
in
holding
the
trial
court
was
correct
in
correcting
the
errors
there
from
forcing
them
to
use
peremptory
challenges.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know.
maybe
they
did
have
some--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--and
i
don't
either.
i
mean,
i
think
that
that
is
one
of
those
situations
where
you
have...
and
it
happens
in
every
jury...
somebody
comes
in,
they've
got
someone
sick
in
the
family,
and
they
just
don't
want
to
serve.
and
the
mississippi
supreme
court
addresses
that
in
its
opinion,
saying
that,
you
know,
we
are
a
busy
society
and
people
don't
want
to
take
the
time
out
to
do
this,
this
duty
of
serving
on
a
jury,
and
they
think
up
every
excuse
in
the
world
to
get
out.
so
this
is
a
situation
that
we
have
to
address,
and
we're
going
to
look
at
here
that
this
trial
judge
here
was
doing
the
best
he
could
here
to
try
to--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--i
think
he
probably
does.
he
has
that
feeling
that
he's
lying,
maybe
not
absolute
proof
for
that
juror.
and
there's
no
way,
i
guess,
that
you
could
ever
prove
that
that
juror
was
perjuring
himself,
but
he
has
that
gut
feeling,
and
that's
what
he's
saying
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
that
would
be
adequate
reason
if
someone...
if
the
judge
feels
like
he's
lying
in
the
voir
dire.
i
think
that
would
be
adequate
reason
to
remove
him
for
cause.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i
think
the
judge
could
remove
him
on
his
own
motion.
if
someone
is
not
going
to
be
honest
in
his
answers
on
voir
dire,
then
how
can
the
judge
be
confident
that
this
person
is
going
to
render
an
honest
verdict.
if
he
gets
mad
for
staying
on
there,
he
may
take
it
out
on
either
party.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
right,
or
for
whatever
cause.
i'm
going
to
excuse
you
for
my
own
cause.
i
don't
think,
you
know,
if
one
side
or
the
other
didn't
exercise
a
challenge
there--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
i
see.
i
was
looking
at
the
overall
picture,
not
this
particular
case.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
are
we
talking
about
juror
bounds
now?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
not
that
i
recall
on
the
record,
i
don't
think.
i
think
the
full
voir
dire--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
i
think
he
took
exception
to
that
in
the
very...
with
the
juror
ruiz,
and
he
says--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--it's
on
the
first.
page
3
right
now
i'm
looking
at.
i
think
that's
not
the
place
where
he
objects
to
the
judge
making
him
use
a
strike.
0....
"all
right,
we
intend
to
use.
"
i
don't
find
it
right
now,
but
in
one
of
the
cases
where
the
judge
required...
on
one
of
these
jurors,
the
state
did
take
exception
and...
oh,
yes.
i
can't
find
it
right
now.
in
one
of
the
jurors
he
did
say
that--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes.
"and
let
the
record
show
the
state
takes
exception
to
the
court's
ruling
that
that,
because
we
think.
"
--and
the
judge
interrupts
and
says:
"all
right.
"
"this
is
a
classic
one
for
cause.
"
and
so
the
state
did
preserve
its
objection
to
what
the
judge
was
doing
in
that
case.
so
we
have
a
situation
here
that
is
ripe,
i
think
and
we
contend,
for
the
application
of
a
harmless
error
rule
here,
because
as
was
stated
in
rose
v.
clark,
per
se
errors
are
those
errors
that
abort
the
basic
trial
process
or
deny
it
altogether.
that
was
not
done
here.
the
basic
trial
process
was
not
aborted
here.
mr.
gray
received
a
fair
trial.
he
does
not
make
the
contention
that
the
jury
that
convicted
and
sentenced
him
wasn't
impartial.
he's
saying
that
because
we
excused
this
one
juror
that
we
have
a
technical
witherspoon,
witt,
adams
violation,
and
therefore
the
case
should
be
reversed
on
the
basis
of
davis
versus
georgia.
and
we
contend
that
this
case
is
so
factually
different
than
davis
versus
georgia
that
the
court
could
leave
undisturbed
davis
versus
georgia
if
they
chose.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
if
there
had
been
no
request
for
an
additional
peremptory...
i
mean,
that's
within
the
discretion
of
the
trial
judge,
there,
too...
i
don't
think
we
would
be
here,
if
we
hadn't
requested
an
extra
peremptory,
which
he
could
have
given
to
the
other
side.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
davis
versus
georgia--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
as
most
harmless
error
cases
must
be,
they
must
be
looked
at
on
a
case
by
case
basis.
i
mean,
there's
no
broad
firm
and
fast
rule
in
a
harmless
error
context.
you've
got
to
look
at
that
error
in
that
case.
and
i
think
that
we
have
to--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--that's
true,
we
have.
the
state
supreme
court--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--well,
they
did
say
in
there
that
they
could
show
no
prejudice,
the
defendant
could
show
no
prejudice.
they
mentioned
prejudice,
and
i
don't
really
know
that
that
really
kicks
in
the
whole
harmless
error
thing,
i
mean,
just
by
saying
that
there
was
no
prejudice
to
mr.
gray.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
that's
what's
been
done,
i
think,
in
rose
v.
clark
and
delaware
versus
van
arsdale.
they
were
sent
back
to
for--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--it
would
have
probably
in
this
particular
case,
since
this
is
one
of
the
populous
counties
and
they
do
have
a
term
of
court
starting
every
other
month,
it
could
have
been
probably
within
a
month,
because
in
a
capital
case
a
special
venire
is
drawn
and
it
takes
a
couple
of
weeks
to
compile
and
draw
and
serve
a
special
venire.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
a
month
or
two,
if
that's
the
situation
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
don't
know
that
we've
ever
had
a
case--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--on
that.
it
has
been
done
in
cases,
but
never
been
raised
as
an
issue.
i
mean,
i've
seen
cases
where
it's
happened,
but
it's
never
been
an
issue
that
the
court
has
spoken
to.
so
it's
something
that
our
court
says
the
trial
judge
has
very
wide
discretion
in
seating
a
jury,
and
it
has
said
that--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
it
is
not.
it
is
on
the
mississippi
gulf
coast,
gulf
port,
biloxi,
where
the
kiesler
air
force
base
is,
i
think.
this
is
where
the
victim--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--no,
it
is
not.
it's
a
very
populous
area.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
sir.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
it's
usually
been
both,
to
both
sides.
you
know,
if
you
give
to
one
you
give
to
the
other.
here
this
is
not,
of
course,
what
the
situation
would
have
been.
the
state
was
saying,
give
us
back
one
that
you
made
us
erroneously
use,
you
erroneously
made
us
use.
so,
but
there
are
cases
where
extra
peremptories
have
been
given.
in
fact,
in
one
capital
case
we
had
that
was
on
appeal,
i
believe
to
mississippi,
the
trial
court
i
believe
gave
an
extra
six
to
both
sides.
so
it
is
just
something
within
the--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--yes,
feeling
good.
i
mean,
i
cannot
explain
that
and
we'll
see
what
our
court
has
to
say
about
that
maybe.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
in
this
case?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
no,
he
said
we're
not
asking
for
an
extra
one,
we're
just
asking
you
to
give
us
back
the
one
that
you
erroneously
made
us
use.
we
didn't
ask
for
an
extra
one;
we
just
said,
correct
your
ruling
on
this
earlier
thing.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
that
is
one
way
to
look
at
it,
i
think,
that
it
could
have
been
that.
i
think
that
what
he's
saying,
what
the
court
is
saying
here,
though,
is
that
what
he
believed
at
the
time...
maybe
they
don't
say
that
there,
but
that
what
he
believed
at
the
time
that
he
was
doing
this.
and
that's
why
they
go
ahead
and
reach
the
conclusion
they
do.
i
think
that
if
it
had
been
clear
from
the
record
that
these
people
were
in
fact
shading
their
testimony
or
whatever...
but
i
think
that
comment
in
there
about
the
judge
saying,
i
had
one
or
two,
i
think
that
that
throws
a
whole
different
light
on
it.
you
know,
i
just
had
one
or
two,
not
five
but
just
one
or
two.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
sure,
and
i
think
that's
what
it
is.
i
think
they're
saying
at
that
earlier
point,
just
pointing
out
what
he
thought
at
the
time
when
he
did
it,
but
he
was
in
error
thinking
that.
and
we're
saying
that
when
he
finally
came
down
by
using
the
word
"cheated"
and
all
that,
he's
realized
his
error
there.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes.
i
mean,
that's
the
way
i
interpret
that.
so
i
think
that
this
is
the
prime
case
for
the
application
of
a
harmless
error
rule.
i
was
saying
that
the
fair
cross-section
argument
that
petitioner
makes,
saying
that
lockhart
does
us
no
help,
gives
us
no
help,
is
that
he
says
that
the
fair
cross-section
somehow
applies
to
the
guilt
phase,
but
does
not
apply
to
the
sentence
phase,
which
if
i
remember
it
all
right
the
whole
purpose
of
lockhart
and
witherspoon
and
all
this
to
remove
these
people
from
the
jury
was
for
the
sentence
phase.
so
i
don't
think
we
get
into
a
fair
cross-section.
he's
saying
that
it
just
diminishes
the
fair
cross-section
arguments.
the
court
held,
of
course,
in
batson...
i
mean,
in
lockhart...
that
the
fair
cross-section
argument
does
not
apply
to
the
petit
jury,
just
to
the
box
that
the
jury
is
drawn
from,
the
venire
is
drawn
from.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
as
i
said,
in
the
method
of
choosing
jurors,
the
jurors
are
numbered
and
they
are
put
in
there
numerically.
as
they
are...
as
one
is
removed,
the
next
one
comes
in.
so
you
don't
get
any
just
random
sampling.
it's
the
next
one
of
numbers
that
come
in
and
take
their
place
in
the
box.
so
only
the
jurors
that
actually
were
in
that
jury
would
have
been
the
jurors
there
at
the
time
that
mrs.
bounds
was
there.
am
i
making
myself
clear?
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
okay.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
because
of...
mrs.
bounds.
because
those
jurors
in
between,
those
stricken
jurors--
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
--and
mrs.
bounds
are
the
same
ones
that
are
sitting
there.
they
would
have
been
the
same
ones
sitting
there.
in
other
words,
the
error
was
not
pointed
out
to
the
court
again
until
mrs.
bounds
got
there:
you've
made
us
use
our
peremptories.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
but
we
have...
he
did
use
some
peremptories
in
the
meantime
and
strike
other
jurors
in
between
those
five
and
mrs.
bounds.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
i'm
not
just
sure.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
that's
true.
but
the
record
shows
that
the
jurors
that
came
between
the
last
strike
and
mrs.
bounds
were
not
stricken
for
peremptory
challenges
and,
you
know,
there
was
no
request
at
that
time.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
yes,
but
i
mean
he
didn't
ask
for
any,
either.
and
he
didn't
become
concerned
about
this
until
mrs.
bounds
got
there.
he
found
those
jurors
acceptable.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
he
very
well
may
have.
mr.
marvin
l.
white,
jr.
well,
i
think
that
it's
reasoned
speculation,
though.
i
think
from
looking
at
the
record
and
seeing
what
those
other
jurors
said,
those
jurors
in
between
there
did
not
equivocate
at
all.
they
didn't
present
a
situation
in
which
it
can
be
reasonably
discerned
he
would
have
had
to
use
a
strike.
i
think
we
have
a
record,
whereas
in
davis
versus
georgia
we
didn't
have
a
record
and
they
were
trying
to
use
peremptory
challenges
after
the
trial
was
over.
here
everything
went
on
at
trial
and
is
of
record.
we
have
a
different
situation
here.
