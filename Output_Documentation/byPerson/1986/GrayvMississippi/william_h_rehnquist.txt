you
may
begin
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
volinsky.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
let
me
ask
you
one
question,
mr.
volinsky,
just
based
on
your
first
sentence,
if
i
may.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
say
the
court's
holding
could
be
based
on
a
legal
error,
on
a
narrow
constitutional
ground,
or
on
a
broad
constitutional
ground.
is
there
some
non-constitutional
ground
on
which
we
could
reverse
the
supreme
court
of
mississippi
here?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
well,
then
if
that
is
your
example
of
legal
error,
which
i
believe
was
one
of
the
things,
that
itself
would
be
a
constitutional
ground,
wouldn't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
volinsky.
chief
justice
william
h.

now

h.

page
are
you
on,
mr.
white?

feeling
good
that
day.

justice

you,
mr.

mr.

do
you
have
something
more?
you
have
six
minutes
remaining.

you,
mr.

case
