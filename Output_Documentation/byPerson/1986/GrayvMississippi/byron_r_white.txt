justice
byron
r.
white
--well,
at
least
here
you've
got
a
finding
by
the
state
supreme
court
that
there
was
an
error
in
dismissing
those
earlier
jurors.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
also,
that
a
subsequent
juror
was
entitled
to
sit,
except
for.
but
do
you
think
that
the
mississippi
supreme
court
found
harmless
error?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
normally
wouldn't
we
remand
to
a
state
court
to
find
harmless
error
if
it
hadn't
found
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
did
you
say
there
are
actual
cases
where
the
trial
judge
has
given
more
peremptories?
justice
byron
r.
white
to
both
sides
or
just
to
the
prosecution?
justice
byron
r.
white
was
there
a
request
for
another
peremptory
here?
justice
byron
r.
white
yes.
