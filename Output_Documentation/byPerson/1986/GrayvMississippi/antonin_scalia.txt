justice
antonin
scalia
that's
a
little
ambiguous,
"i'll
try".
justice
antonin
scalia
it's
not
quite
a
yes,
is
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
not
be
good
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
may
not
be
good
enough.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that
isn't
the
theory.
it
isn't
just
a
tit
for
tat.
the
theory
was
that
if
the
prosecution
had
had
another
peremptory
challenge,
the
prosecution
would
have
exercised
it
as
to
this
particular
juror,
and
therefore
the
excusing
of
this
juror
is
harmless.
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
can't
be
100
percent
certain,
but
there
can
be
no
doctrine
of
harmless
error,
mr.
volinsky,
if
you
require
100
percent
certainty.
it's
hard
to
imagine
an
error
you
can
say
was
100
percent
certain
to
have
been
harmless.
justice
antonin
scalia
all
you're
saying
here
is
that
you
can't
say
for
sure
that
the
prosecution
would
have
challenged
this
juror
had
the
prosecution
had
one
more
left,
but
gee,
doesn't
it
seem
very,
very
likely
indeed.
the
prosecution
is
saying
this
juror
is
so
bad
that
she
should
be
excused
automatically,
and
to
think
that
if
he
had
a
peremptory
left
he
wouldn't
have
used
it,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
that
that
could
have
happened
on
the
facts
of
this
case.
well,
i
find
it
difficult
to
believe
otherwise.
it
seems
to
me
that
she
was
fairly
well
rehabilitated,
and
that
there
is
an
element
of
distinct
speculation
as
to
whether
that
peremptory,
if
it
existed,
would
have
been
exercised.
justice
antonin
scalia
why
was
the
prosecutor
asking
to
have
some
of
his
peremptories
back,
then,
if
he
didn't
intend
to
use
them?
do
you
think
if
the
judge
had
said,
okay,
you
can
have
them
back,
the
prosecution
would
say,
thank
you,
your
honor,
i
don't
intend
to
use
them,
i
want
to
use
them
on
later
witnesses...
on
later
people?
it's
inconceivable,
isn't
it?
justice
antonin
scalia
he
would
have
had
one
mad
trial
judge
on
his
hands
if
he
didn't,
wouldn't
he?
justice
antonin
scalia
--what
more
could
he
have
done?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
it
wasn't
realistically...
it
wasn't
realistically
within
his
power
to
do
anything
otherwise
unless,
and
not
have
this
juror
seated,
unless
he
were
given
back
one
of
the
peremptories
that
had
been
taken
away
earlier.
justice
antonin
scalia
that's
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
well
now,
it's
not
just
inadvertent,
because
he
says
later:
"i'm
not
going
to
add
any
to
his
challenges.
"
i
think
you've
got
to
admit
he
knew
what
he
was
doing,
that
he
knew
he
was
dismissing
this
juror
for
cause,
rather
than
giving
the
prosecutor
another
peremptory.
justice
antonin
scalia
it
would
have
been
smarter,
perhaps,
to
give
the
prosecutor
another
peremptory,
but
he
didn't.
he
excused
this
juror
for
cause,
and
he
knew
what
he
was
doing.
justice
antonin
scalia
you
wouldn't
remove
him;
you'd
leave
him
on.
you'd
leave
him
on
and
make
the
state
exercise
its...
well,
no.
what
would
he
do?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
remove
him
as
a
perjurer?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
that's
not
what
he
did.
he
did
just
the
opposite.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
left
them
on
because
they
were
lying.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
said,
these
people
who
say
that
they
can't
vote
against
capital
punishment,
they're
lying.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
if
we
were
to
agree
with
you,
what
is
to
protect
us
from
an
assertion
every
time
that
there
is
a
davis
versus
georgia
error
on
the
part
of
the
trial
court?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
is
to
protect
us
from
the
prosecution
coming
in
and
saying:
well,
yes,
this
juror
shouldn't
have
been
discharged,
but
nonetheless,
but
nonetheless
the
trial
court
made
these
five
errors
earlier
in
not
allowing
peremptories,
and
therefore
we
want
you
to
review
the
disallowance
of
all
of
the
peremptories?
is
that
what
we're
letting
ourselves
in
for
by
listening--
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
but
isn't
the
answer
that
the
supreme
court's
opinion
later
makes
it
clear
that
the
supreme
court,
does
not,
does
not
think
that
there
was
a
finding
of
fact
that
these
jurors
were
lying?
i
mean,
on
page
52
they
say:
"although
the
route
taken
to
mrs.
bounds'
dismissal
was
a
circuitous
one
indeed.
"
blah-blah-blah-blah,
"the
force
and
effect
of
the
trial
court's
ruling
was
to
correct
an
error
he
had
committed.
"
so
the
supreme
court
acknowledged
that
the
trial
judge
wrongly
thought
these
people
were
dissembling.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
that's
certainly
how
i
understood
it.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
white,
how
clear
is
it
that,
assuming
the
mistakes
hadn't
been
made
and
assuming
they
were
mistakes
concerning
the
earlier
refusals
to
dismiss
for
cause...
assuming
those
mistakes
had
not
been
made,
how
do
we
know
that
the
peremptory
challenges
that
the
state
would
thereby
have
had
in
its
pocket
wouldn't
have
been
used
up
by
the
time
this
juror
came
around?
justice
antonin
scalia
if
that's
in
answer
to
my
question,
i
don't
understand
it.
what
i'm
concerned
about
is
that
the
state,
assuming
that
the
trial
judge
had
ruled
correctly--
justice
antonin
scalia
--initially
and
had
not
required
the
state
to
use
its
peremptory
challenges,
right,
how
do
we
know
what
those
peremptory
challenges
wouldn't
have
been
used
up
on
some
other
juror
before
this
juror,
before
mrs.
couch?
what
was
her
name?
justice
antonin
scalia
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
when
was
the
last
one
before
mrs.
bounds?
justice
antonin
scalia
what
i'm
saying
is
that
if
there
were,
you
know,
five
people
that
came
in
before
mrs.
bounds,
if
he
had
had
another
three
peremptories
he
might
have
used
up
those
three.
justice
antonin
scalia
of
course
they
weren't.
he
had
none.
justice
antonin
scalia
he
says:
"there
is
no
logical
reason
not
to
allow
the
trial
court
in
this
situation
to
correct
its
erroneous
ruling.
"
justice
antonin
scalia
"notions
of
judicial
economy
make
it
clear
that
the
trial
court
should
be
allowed
to
recognize
and
correct
its
error
early
in
the
proceedings.
"
i
interpret
that
to
mean
its
error,
its
error
in
the
dismissal
of
the
other
jurors,
or
refusing
to--
