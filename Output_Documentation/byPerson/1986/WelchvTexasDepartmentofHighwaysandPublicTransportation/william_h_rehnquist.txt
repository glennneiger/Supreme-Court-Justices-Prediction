mr.

you
may
begin
whenever
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
cucullu.
we
will
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
mccown.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
of
course,
if
you
are
correct,
why
would
the
petty
court
have
analyzed
the
thing
under
two
distinct
heads?
don't
you
read
that
decision
as
first
saying
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
was
waived
by
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
sue
and
be
sued,
and
then
going
on
to
say,
and
the
jones
act
includes
states
within
the
definition
of
employers?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
you
don't
challenge
california
against
united
states,
then,
holding
that
a
state
was
an
employer
for
purposes
of
the
fela,
because
you
say
the
jones
act
is
different
from
the
fela.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
mccown.
