mr.
f.
scott
mccown
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
i
would
like
to
divide
my
argument
into
two
parts.
in
part
one
i
am
going
to
offer
the
court
a
very
conservative
way
to
resolve
this
case
that
turns
completely
on
the
statutory
construction
of
the
jones
act,
requires
the
court
to
overrule
no
cases
and
decide
no
constitutional
questions.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
no,
your
honor,
i
think
it
doesn't
ignore
that
doctrine,
because
i
think
in
fact...
well,
let
me
answer
that
two
ways.
number
one,
i
think
it
is
more
important
to
decide
the
statutory
question
to
avoid
the
constitutional
question
than
it
is
to
decide
the
jurisdictional
question
first.
but
number
two,
this
case
is
just
like
the
occasional
case
of
jurisdiction
where
the
merits
and
jurisdiction
are
entwined.
here,
to
decide
the
jurisdictional
question
you
really
have
to...
i
think
the
best
first
step
is
to
ask
whether
this
statute
even
authorizes
a
suit
against
the
state
at
all
before
then
reaching
the
eleventh
amendment
issue
that
the
case
presents.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
yes,
your
honor,
that
is
what
the
petty
court
says,
but
i
think
the
petty
court
is
wrong,
and
would
offer
the
court
three
proofs.
congress
never
intended
to
authorize
a
person
employed
by
a
state
to
bring
a
jones
act
claim
against
the
state.
the
only
statutory
definition
of
seaman
that
you
will
find
in
the
united
states
code
explicitly
excludes
persons
employed
by
the
state,
and
that
definition
in
fact
applies
to
the
jones
act.
i
am
referring
to
what
was
46
usc
section
1713,
which
defines
seaman
as
a
person
employed
on
board
a
vessel
belonging
to
a
citizen
of
the
united
states,
and
as
the
court
well
knows,
a
state
is
not
a
citizen.
that
definition
excludes
a
person
employed
by
the
state.
the
second
circuit
held
in
an
opinion
by
augustus
hand
in
the
gerin
case
in
1932
that
that
definition
of
seaman
found
in
section
1713
applies
to
the
jones
act,
and
judge
hand
goes
though
what
is
a
complicated
statutory
analysis,
but
it
is
not
at
all
a
tortured
or
strained
analysis,
and
i
think
he
is
absolutely
correct
when
you
go
and
pull
out
the
statute
books
and
look
at
them,
and
it
is
a
three-step
process,
and
i
think
it
is
worth
going
through.
judge
hand
reasons
that
the
jones
act
expressly
amended
section
20
of
the
american
seamans
act
of
1915.
that
is
step
one.
step
two
is
that
section
20
of
the
american
seamans
act
expressly
amended
title
53
of
the
revised
statutes
of
1878.
that
is
step
two.
and
step
three
was
that
title
53
of
the
revised
statutes
of
1878
had
at
the
time
that
it
was
amended
a
definition
of
seaman
which
congress
must
have
had
reference
to
when
it
enacted
the
american
seamans
act
and
which
then
must
have
had
reference
to
when
the
jones
act
amended
the
american
seamans
act,
and
that
definition
was
the
codified
definition
of
seamen
found
in
the
act
of
1872
defining
a
seaman
as
a
person
employed
on
board
a
vessel
owned
by
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
that
is
the
definition
that
was
found
until
1983
in
46
usc
section
1713,
and
since
1983
has
been
found
in
46
usc
section
10,101,
subdivision
3.
so
for
115
years
the
only
congressional
definition
of
seaman
expressly
excluded
a
person
employed
by
the
states.
that
leads
to
my
second
proof,
that
the
state
doesn't
come
within
the
terms
of
the
jones
act,
and
that
is
the
legislative
history
of
the
jones
act
itself
which
was
part
of
the
merchant
marine
act
of
1920.
it
is
completely
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
the
state
comes
within
the
jones
act.
first,
as
is
conceded
by
the
petitioner,
not
a
single
word
in
the
entire
history
of
the
merchant
marine
act
appears
talking
about
the
states,
but
secondly,
regulating
the
states
does
not
fit
within
the
purpose
of
the
merchant
marine
act.
section
one
of
the
merchant
marine
act
expressly
provides
that
it
is
being
enacted
to
foster
a
merchant
marine,
and
i
quote,
"to
be
owned
and
operated
privately
by
citizens
of
the
united
states.
"
so
that
the
legislative
purpose
of
the
merchant
marine
act
fits
with
the
statutory
definition
of
seaman
which
would
exclude
seamen
employed
by
the
states.
but
finally,
i
offer
proof
three,
which
is
really
an
elementary
but
i
think
quite
convincing
point,
that
the
venue
provision
of
the
jones
act
is
inconsistent
with
the
view
that
the
jones
act
applies
to
the
states,
and
if
you
look
at
the
last
sentence
of
the
jones
act,
you
will
see
that
venue
is
provided
in
the
district
in
which
the
defendant
employer
resides,
clearly
implying
a
natural
person,
or
in
which
his
principal
office
is
located,
clearly
implying
a
corporation.
a
state
would
not
fit
within
that
venue
provision.
and
if
you
compare
that
venue
provision
to
the
venue
provision
in
the
federal
employers
liability
act
you
will
find
that
the
fela
has
a
quite
different
venue
provision
authorizing
venue
where
the
cause
of
action
arose.
so
when
the
petitioner
says
that
it
is
not
contested
that
there
is
a
jones
act
seaman,
that
is
simply
incorrect.
what
wasn't
contested
on
the
12(b)
motion
were
the
facts
alleged
in
the
plaintiff's
complaint,
but
the--
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
--that's
right.
the
question
here
is
what
congress
intended,
and
i
think
this
case
can
be
bottomed
completely
on
statutory
construction.
the
argument
that
any
seaman
means
any
seaman
then
simply
ignores
the
congressional
definition
of
seaman.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
i
think,
your
honor,
that
petty
is
completely
dicta.
petty
had
two
holdings.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
yes,
the
dicta--
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
--the
dicta
should
be
rejected,
your
honor,
and
i
would
point
out
that
petty
had
two
holdings.
the
primary
holding
was
that
the
jones
act
applied
because
of
the
sue
or
be
used
clause
that
congress
imposed
as
a
condition
of
allowing
the
interstate
compact.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
that
there
was
waiver,
yes,
your
honor,
on
the
sue
and
be
sued
clause,
but
the
second
holding
was
that
the
commission
could
be
sued
under
the
jones
act.
now,
i
emphasize
the
reason
that
the...
saying
the
states
could
be
sued
under
the
jones
act
is
dicta
is
because
no
state
was
a
party
to
the
petty
case.
it
was
simply
petty
and
the
tennessee-missouri
bridge
commission.
there
is
nothing
that...
when
you
say
the
commission
can
be
sued
that
doesn't
compel
the
dicta
that
the
state
can
be
sued,
and
interestingly,
your
honor,
the
court
specifically
referred
to
the
commission
as
a
bi-state
corporation,
and
i
think
that
would
fit
then
with
my
statutory
construction.
you
could
argue
that
the
commission
has
citizenship
just
as
a
municipal
corporation
as
citizenship,
and
that
the
commission,
which
is
a
creature
in
essence
chartered
by
congress
and
the
states,
is
different
than
a
state.
and
there
is
nothing
in
the
dicta
of
petty
that
compels
the
conclusion
that
the
state
could
be
sued
as
well,
or
that
congress
intended
the
state
to
be
sued
as
well.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
i
think
that
is
right,
your
honor.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
certainly.
you
have
to
reject
the
rationale
of
that
alternative
holding.
there
is
no
doubt
about
that.
but
the
reason
you
don't...
that
courts
don't
put
stock
in
dicta
as
they
do
in
holdings
is
because
dicta
is
often
ill-considered,
and
indeed
in
petty
you
don't
have
the
court
going
through
and
reviewing
the
statutory
definition
that
congress
provided,
nor
do
you
have
the
court
reviewing
the
legislative
history
of
the
merchant
marines
act
of
which
the
jones
act
was
a
part.
so
i
think
it
is
well...
it
is
dicta
that
is
well
cast
aside.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
well,
if
you
don't
overrule
petty
you
don't
even
reach
the
parden
question
because--
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
--excuse
me.
sure.
you
don't
have
to
overrule
the
result.
i
mean,
petty
would
still
be
law.
but
you
would
have
to
reject
the
rationale.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
that's
right.
let
me
make
one
more
argument
about
the
jones
act
before
i
reach
parden.
the
plaintiff
makes
an
incorporation
argument
about
the
fela
in
parden.
i
will
use
that
as
my
introduction
into
parden.
the
plaintiff
argues
that
the
jones
act
incorporate
the
fela
and
therefore,
because
the
fela
authorizes
suit
against
the
state,
then
therefore
the
jones
act
does.
but
in
fact
the
jones
act
doesn't
incorporate
the
fela
to
define
who
is
a
seaman
or
whom
a
seaman
may
sue.
the
jones
act
provides
that
any
seaman
may
maintain
an
action
and
then
separately
provides
that
in
such
action
the
fela
is
incorporated
but
the
fela
is
not
incorporated
to
define
seaman
nor
to
define
whom
a
seaman
may
take
an
action
against.
and
indeed
the
purpose
behind
the
incorporation
of
the
fela,
as
this
court
has
said,
was
to
abolish
the
traditional
admiralty
defenses
favoring
the
employer.
it
was
not
in
any
sense
to
define
who
a
seaman
was.
now
that
leads
to
parden,
because
i
think
that
the
plaintiff's
incorporation
argument
really
casts
aside
congressional
intent.
the
fela
was
enacted
in
1908.
the
jones
act
incorporated
the
fela
in
1920,
but
the
fela
was
not
applied
to
the
states,
held
to
apply
to
the
states
until
the
parden
decision
in
1964.
so
if
the
court
reads
parden
as
saying
congress
truly
had
an
intent
to
apply
fela
to
the
states,
then
there
might
be
something
to
the
incorporation
argument
had
it
been
incorporated.
but
in
fact
i
think
that
that
reading
of
parden
misses
the
mark
because
what
this
court
does
require
is
a
clear
statement
before
finding
that
an
act
of
congress
abrogates
immunity.
parden
should
be
limited
as
a
matter
of
presumptive
statutory
construction,
but
its
rationale
that
the
mere
fact
that
you
enter
into
a
regulated
sphere
of
activity
then
subjects
you
to
any
act
of
congress
the
general
terms
of
which
a
state
would
come
under
i
think
has
to
be
rejected
in
light
of
employees,
in
light
of
edelman,
and
in
light
of
atascadero.
and
indeed,
justice
douglas,
who
wrote
the
four-person
dissent
for
the
court
in
parden,
wrote
the
majority
for
the
court
in
the
employees
decision,
and
i
think
he
has
the
better
of
the
argument,
which
is
before
you
find
that
an
act
of
congress
applies
to
the
state
you
have
to
find
that
the
act
of
congress
in
a
clear,
unequivocal
expression
that
that
is
what
congress
intended
to
do.
the
purpose
for
such
a
rule
would
be
to
protect
the
integrity
of
the
state
and
to
protect
the
state
fisk,
and
the
source
for
such
a
rule
would
be
the
role
of
the
states
within
the
federal
structure.
i
would
like
to
give
you
four
analogies.
of
course,
in
pennhurst
i,
you
develop
a
similar
rule,
that
if
congress
is
going
to
act
pursuant
to
its
section
5
fourteenth
amendment
power,
that
it
have
to
do
so
clearly
before
the
court
find
that
it
has
done
so.
in
pennhurst
i
reaffirmed
the
rule
that
if
congress
is
going
to
condition
a
grant
of
federal
money
that
that
has
to
be
an
unambiguous
condition
in
order
to
provide
notice
to
the
states.
atasedero,
which
is
an
eleventh
amendment
jurisdiction
case,
makes
the
same
point,
that
there
must
be
an
unequivocal
expression
of
congressional
intent
before
finding
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
abrogated.
the
court's
preemption
cases
make
the
same
point
before
finding
that
a
state
is
preempted
it
has
to
be
clearly
and
manifestly
the
purpose
of
congress
in
a
statute
to
preempt
the
states.
and
finally,
my
fourth
analogy
would
be
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states
itself,
and
how
the
court
treats
that.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
yes,
sir.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
it
is
absolutely
settled,
and
the
court
took
on
both
heads
of
admiralty
jurisdiction
in
new
york
one
and
new
york
two
in
1921.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
and
it
said
that
admiralty
in
rem
jurisdiction
against
a
vessel
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity
doctrine
under
the
eleventh
amendment
and
admiralty
in
personem
jurisdiction
is
barred
by
sovereign
immunity
under
the
eleventh
amendment.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
sir?
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
and
petty
accepted
that
as
well,
so
the
notion
that
admiralty
somehow
has
an
exception
doesn't
come
into
play
in
this
case.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
well,
i
think
the
explanation
was
that
the
eleventh
amendment
is
but
an
exemplification
of
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity,
and
the
doctrine
of
sovereign
immunity
comes
from
the
structure
of
the
constitution
and
applies
to
admiralty
as
well
as
it
does
to
law
or
to
equity.
and
indeed
the
clear
statement
should
be
required
in
admiralty
when
congress
acts
every
bit
as
much
as
if
congress...
i
look
at
it
the
different
way
around.
if
pursuant
to
section
5
of
the
fourteenth
amendment
there
must
be
a
clear
statement
from
congress,
then
surely
in
an
admiralty
case
there
must
be
a
clear
statement
from
congress
before
presuming
that
congress
intended
to
in
any
way
attempt
to
regulate
the
states.
i
also
think
that
the
question
of
power,
what
congress
can
do
can
be
separated
completely
from
the
question
of
what
the
rule
of
statutory
construction
would
be,
and
i
use
my
fourth
analogy
to
illustrate
that.
congress
can
waive
its
own
sovereign
immunity
and
congress
can
authorize
a
citizen
to
bring
a
suit
for
money
damages
against
the
united
states.
there
is
no
doubt
about
the
congressional
power
to
do
that.
but
before
this
court
reads
an
act
of
congress
as
in
any
way
consenting
to
an
action
for
money
damages
against
the
united
states,
the
court
requires
congress
to
clearly
and
unequivocally
say
in
a
statute
that
that
is
what
it
intends
to
do.
and
that
rule
is
designed,
of
course,
to
protect
the
sovereign
immunity
of
the
united
states,
so
the
rule
can
have
a
prudential
basis
completely
separate
from
any
constitutional
basis,
and
indeed
in
this
case
what
the
anomaly
is
is
that
the
jones
act
has
been
held
by
this
court
not
to
apply
to
a
federal
seaman,
so
a
seaman
of
the
united
states
on
either
a
public
or
merchant
vessel
has
no
jones
act
claim.
he
is
limited
only
to
federal
employers'
compensation
just
as
the
state
of
texas
argues
that
ms.
welch
is
limited
to
state
workers'
compensation.
so
they
would
be
in
the
same
position
as
a
result
of
congress-not
expressly
saying
in
the
statute
that
the
jones
act
applies
to
the
uinted
states
or
that
the
jones
act
applies
to
the
states.
the
question
of
admiralty
in
this
case
really
puts
the
cart
before
the
horse,
because
before
deciding
that
this
is
an
admiralty
case
the
court
would
have
to
decide
that
the
jones
act
was
intended
by
congress
to
be
an
exercise
of
its
admiralty
power
against
the
states,
but
indeed
admiralty
law
recognizes
sovereign
immunity.
the
state
doesn't
quarrel
with
the
holding
in
pope
and
talbott
that
the
state
can
supplement
but
not
supersede
admiralty
law,
nor
with
the
holding
in
jensen
that
the
state
can't
make
compensation
exclusive
remedy
for
a
private
employer,
nor
the
holding
in
workman
that
new
york
local
law
can't
supersede
admiralty
law.
what
the
state
contends
is
that
congress
has
not
acted
under
admiralty
law
and
had
no
intention
to
apply
the
jones
act
to
the
state,
that
there
ought
to
be
a
clear
rule
based
upon
the
notion
of
federalism
in
the
structure
of
the
constitution,
and
that
if
you
do
reach
the
constitutional
question
that
new
york
one
and
new
york
two
settled
that
sovereign
immunity
is
recognized
in
admiralty
as
well
as
the
other
founts
of
jurisdiction
and
that
the
state
would
be
protected.
one
last
point
about
the
proper
disposition
of
this
case,
and
coming
back
to
how
we
opened
the
argument,
the
state
in
this
instance
filed
a
motion
to
dismiss
both
based
on
12(b)(1),
a
failure
of
subject
matter
jurisdiction
under
the
eleventh
amendment,
and
12(b)(6),
a
failure
to
state
a
claim
for
which
relief
can
be
granted.
the
district
court
held
quite
rightly
that
there
was
no
jones
act
remedy
here
and
dismissed
with
prejudice
as
an
adjudication
and
said
there
won't
be
any
jones
act
claim
for
you
anywhere
in
federal
or
state
court.
i
think
that
is
the
proper
analysis
and
the
best
first
step
to
avoid
then
reaching
the
eleventh
amendment
questions.
should
the
court,
however,
decide
that
there
is
a
jones
act
claim
against
the
state,
then
the
question
becomes
whether
it
can
be
brought
in
federal
court
or
state
court.
under
atascadero,
there
is
no
doubt
that
it
can't
be
brought
in
federal
court
because
the
statute
doesn't
have
an
unequivocal
expression
of
intent
to
abrogate
immunity
to
suit
in
federal
court,
and
in
answer
to
justice
white's
question
to
my
colleague
representing
the
petitioner,
were
the
case
remanded
the
statute
under
texas
law
would
not
have
run.
there
is
a
saving
statute
that
provides
if
a
case
is
dismissed
for
lack
of
jurisdiction
then
the
petitioner
has,
i
believe,
60
or
90
days
to
refile
that.
that
applies
for
federal
dismissals
into
state
court,
so
there
would
be
a
state
claim
should
the
court
decide
that
the
jones
act
applies
to
the
states.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
well,
that's...
the
lyons
decision,
which
was
a
decision
by
an
intermediary
court
of
appeals
in
texas,
said
that
there
is
no
jones
act
claim,
but
obviously
were
this
court
to
hold
that
there
is
a
jones
act
claim
against
the
state,
well,
then
certainly
the
state
courts
of
texas
would
honor
that.
if
not,
it
would
come
up
the
other
side
of
the
ladder
back
to
the
court,
but
i
am
quite
confident
that
if
the
supreme
court
says
there
is
a
jones
act
claim
against
the
state,
that
the
state
district
court
in
houston
is
going
to
honor
it.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
certainly,
but
any
state
law
case
could
be
superseded
by
a
later
opinion
of
this
court
to
the
contrary.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
certainly.
the
federal
law
would
preempt...
this
court
said
as
a
matter
of
federal
law
that
state
could
not
make
workers'
compensation
exclusive
and
that
the
state
court...
that
here
was
a
jones
act
claim,
then
that
would
supersede
the
lyons
decision
by
the
state
court.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
i
think
you
can,
justice
white,
because
the
only
reason
that
the
state
court...
the
only
reason
the
state
court
refused
to
entertain
the
jones
act
claim
was
because
it
believed
that
there
wasn't
a
jones
act
claim.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
i
don't
know
the
answer
to
that
question.
i
think
it
is
somewhat
unresolved.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
well,
this
court
has
held
that
a
state
court
can,
that
venue
in
a
state
court
was
proper
in
the
panama
case.
now,
whether
you
would
take
that
the
next
step
under
the
testa
line
of
cases
and
say
that
a
state
court
had
to
i
suppose
is
an
open
question.
i
think
as
a
practical
matter
the
courts
of
texas
would
entertain
a
jones
act
claim
were
the
court
to
say
that
there
was
one.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
it
was
that
the
jones
act
doesn't
cover
it
because
of
the
state's
sovereign
immunity.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
yes,
sir,
a
question
of
federal
constitutional
law.
now,
there
were
two
questions
there.
on
the
one
on
the
one
hand
you
had
a
state
statute
which
said
worker's
compensation
is
the
exclusive
remedy.
that
state
statute
was
upheld,
but
the
reason
that
it
was
upheld
but
the
reason
that
it
was
upheld
by
the
lyons
court
is
because
the
jones
act
couldn't
apply
to
the
states
because
of
state
sovereign
immunity,
so
were
this
court
to
say
that
in
fact
the
jones
act
does
apply
to
the
states
and
that
congress
has
abrogated
the
state
sovereign
immunity,
then
i
think
the
reasoning
behind
the
defense
of
the
state
statute
would
have
to
give
way.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
that
would
be
my
position,
but
it
doesn't
have
to
follow.
i
think
the
court
could
adopt
two
different
rules.
the
court
could
say
that
for
eleventh
amendment
purposes
there
has
to
be
a
clear
statement,
but
that
you
could
take
your
federal
claim
to
state
court,
but
i
think
you
are
right
that
that
would
be
a
ridiculous
result.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
i
think
that
is
right.
i
think
if
you
are
going
to
say
that
there
isn't
congressional
intent
for
the
purpose
of
the
eleventh
amendment
because
it
falls
the
clear
statement
test,
that
you
shouldn't
then
allow
it
to
apply
to
the
states
under
a
lower
threshold
for
congressional
intent.
i
think
congress
either
did
intend
or
didn't
intend,
and
there
ought
to
be
one
rule
of
construction,
and
that
ought
to
be
the
clear
statement
rule.
but
regardless
of
the
clear
statement
rule,
i
mean,
i
am
confident
enough
about
the
statutory
construction
in
this
case
to
say
that
whatever...
just
the
regular
rules
for
litigants
to
construe
a
federal
statue
that
the
state
of
texas
wouldn't
come
within
the
jones
act
given
the
congressional
definition
of
seamen.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
no.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
well--
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
--i
think
that
that
that
rationale
would
save
petty.
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
yes,
it
did.
but--
mr.
f.
scott
mccown
--i
think
it
is
wrong.
i
think
it
is
clearly
wrong.
i
mean,
you
have
a
1950
opinion
by
the
court
where
the
court
did
not
consider
any
of
the
arguments
that
are
being
advanced
today,
simply
looked
at
the
word
"any
seaman",
said
any
seaman
means
any
seaman,
did
not
refer
to
the
congressional
definition
of
seaman,
did
not
refer
to
the
statutory
history
of
seaman
or
the
purpose
of
the
jones
act
or
the
merchant
marine
act.
so
i
think
petty
was
ill-considered
dicta
and
shouldn't
be
confirmed
by
the
court
and
we
would
ask
that
the
court
of
appeals
be
affirmed.
