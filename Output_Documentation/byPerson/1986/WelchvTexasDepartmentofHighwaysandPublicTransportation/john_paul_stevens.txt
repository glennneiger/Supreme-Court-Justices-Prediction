justice
john
paul
stevens
general
mccown,
can
i
ask
you
a
question
about
the
eleventh
amendment?
justice
john
paul
stevens
which
says
that
the
judicial
power
of
the
united
states
doesn't
extend
to
any
suit
in
law
or
equity.
it
doesn't
mention
maritime
or
admiralty,
whereas
article
iii
jurisdiction
has
a
separate
provision
for
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction.
how
well
settled
is
it
that
the
eleventh
amendment
applies
in
admiralty
and
maritime
matters?
justice
john
paul
stevens
in
the
two
new
york
cases.
justice
john
paul
stevens
they
didn't
really
explain
it
very
well
in
the
new
york
cases,
did
they?
they
just
sort
of
said
it.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes,
but
if
we
adopted
that
reasoning
we
would
be
finding
there
is
no
eleventh
amendment
bar,
either.
it
seems
to
me
if
we
find
an
eleventh
amendment
bar
on
the
ground
that
congress
has
not
clearly
spoken,
we
couldn't
consistently
say,
well,
they
did
clearly
speak
if
a
case
is
brought
in
state
court.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
seems
to
me
there
is
a
little
tension
there.
justice
john
paul
stevens
is
it
not
true
that
it
those...
and
your
argument
is
very
persuasive,
but
if
your
argument
is
correct
really
petty
should
have
been
decided
the
other
way.
justice
john
paul
stevens
wouldn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
most
of
your
argument
seems
to
me
about
employed
by,
i
forget...
a
citizen
of
the
united
states.
you
are
saying
the
bi-state
compact
would
have
been
a
citizen
of
the
united
states?
