justice
byron
r.

do
federal
courts
are
exclusive
jurisdiction
under
the
jones
act?
justice
byron
r.
white
how
about
a
state
court
suit?
justice
byron
r.
white
what,
has
the
statute
run
now,
or
what?
justice
byron
r.
white
because
it
didn't
seem
to
me
that
the
court
of
appeals
foreclosed
any
jones
act
suit
in
the
state
court.
petty
would
indicate
that
it
was
open.
justice
byron
r.
white
in
the
court
of
appeals.
justice
byron
r.
white
i
see.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
that
the
judge
indicated
that
texas
has
closed
its
court
to
jones
act
cases?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
don't
think
xxx
do
you?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
court
of
appeals
didn't
question
petty?
justice
byron
r.
white
so
your
client
was
a
jones
act
employee.
justice
byron
r.
white
that
was
the
holding
of
petty,
wasn't
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
didn't
they
treat
a
state
employee
as
a
jones
act
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
jones
act
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
exactly.
justice
byron
r.
white
we
should
judge
this
case
as
though
this
client
was
a
jones
act
seaman?
justice
byron
r.
white
xxx
not
follow
petty.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
anyway,
your
answer
is
yes--
justice
byron
r.
white
--you
don't
follow
that
part
of
petty?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
jones
act
applies
or
that
you
can
sue
because
of
that?
justice
byron
r.
white
and
i
suppose
now
you
are
going
to
say
that
if
you
don't
overrule
petty
you
overrule
parden.
justice
byron
r.
white
if
you
overrule
it.
justice
byron
r.
white
now
your
other
argument
is
parden,
i
guess.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
petty
accepted
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
petty
accepted
that.
justice
byron
r.
white
what
about
the
statement
that
the
jones
act
cases
will
not
be
entertained
in
the
state
courts
because
the
only
thing
that
is
left
is
whether
the
workman's
compensation
act
applies?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
did
judge
gee
say
that
that
case
was
binding
as
matter
of
state
law?
justice
byron
r.
white
that
wasn't
a
state...
we
can't
supersede
a
decision
on
state
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
maybe
congress
can
make
a
state
entertain
a
suit
under
a
federal
statute,
but
absent
that
can
we
order
a
state
court
to
entertain
a
jones
act
claim?
justice
byron
r.
white
you
think
any
time
there
is
a...
any
time
unless
congress
makes
federal
court
jurisdiction
exclusive,
any
time
there
is
a
cause
of
action
under
a
federal
statute
a
state
court
has
to
entertain
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
why
must
a
state
court
entertain
a
jones
act
case
then?
justice
byron
r.
white
what
was
the
ground
for
that
intermediate
appellate
court
decision
in
texas?
did
it
say
that
we
just
don't
entertain
jones
act
cases
or
that
in
our
opinion
the
jones
act
doesn't
cover
it?
justice
byron
r.
white
it
was
purporting
to
decide
a
question
of
federal
law.
justice
byron
r.
white
certainly
petty
purported
to
construe
the
jones
act.
justice
byron
r.
white
you
say
that
construction
was
wrong.
