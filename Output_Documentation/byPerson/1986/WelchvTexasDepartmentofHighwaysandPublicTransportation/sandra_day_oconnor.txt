justice
sandra
day
o'connor
mr.
cucullu,
would
you
say
that
the
constructive
waiver
theory
in
parden
is
inconsistent
with
this
court's
most
recent
statements
about
the
need
for
congress
to
use
express
language
to
leave
no
room
for
another
construction
if
the
state's
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
to
be
waived?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
is
it
open
to
us,
do
you
think,
to
just
overrule
parden
in
this
case?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
in
your
brief
you
also
argue
that
in
any
event
the
state
has
waived
its
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
you
didn't
present
that
as
one
of
the
questions
for
us
to
resolve
on
certiorari
or
appeal.
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
and
it
isn't
really
properly
before
us
or
open
to
us
to
decide
that
surely.
