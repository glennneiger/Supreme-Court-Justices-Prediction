do
we
have
the
first
clearly,
a
person
who
clearly
as
a
remedy
under
the
jones
act?
that
is
certainly
not
conceded
by
the
other
side.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
maybe
we
do,
maybe
we
don't.
you
are
saying
we
clearly
do.
i
mean,
it
is
not
even
an
issue?
justice
antonin
scalia
a
seaman
who
can
recover
under
the
jones
act.
i
am
talking
about
whether
the
jones
act
substantively
was
meant
to
apply
to--
justice
antonin
scalia
--no,
i
am
not
talking
about
the
status
as
a
seaman.
i
am
just
talking
about
whether
when
the
jones
act
refers
to
any
seaman
it
includes
a
seaman
who
is
a
seaman
of
a
state.
justice
antonin
scalia
but
to
ignore
the
doctrine
that
you
reach
jurisdictional
issues
first.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
may
call
it
dicta
but
it
was
really
the
rationale,
the
rationale
of
finding
that
the
bi-state
commission
was
suable
was
apparently
that
a
state
is
suable,
and
therefore
a
bi-state
would
be
suable.
isn't
that
basically
the
reasoning
the
court
was
using?
justice
antonin
scalia
i
mean,
you
can
all
it
dictum,
but
it
is
a
dictum
that
is
part
of
the
rationale.
we
would
at
least
be
rejecting
the
rationale
of
the
case.
