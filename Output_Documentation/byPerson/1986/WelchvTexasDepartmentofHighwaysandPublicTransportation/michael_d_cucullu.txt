mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court,
jean
welch
was
crushed
and
injured
between
a
mobile
crane
and
a
guard
rail
in
1981
while
employed
as
a
marine
technician
for
the
state
highway
department
of
the
state
of
texas.
faced
with
the
proposition
that
a
line
of
decisions
in
texas
precludes
her
from
pursuing
a
jones
act
case
within
the
state
court
system
she
sued
for
jones
act
remedies
in
the
federal
district
court
in
houston,
and
was
denied
by
virtue
of
a
motion
to
dismiss
founded
upon
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
district
court
reasoned
that
the
eleventh
amendment
precluded
her
right
to
pursue
her
jones
act
claim
in
federal
district
court.
that
is
the
issue
which
comes
here
by
way
of
the
fifth
circuit,
which
held
in
its
en
banc
decision
that
the
recent
line
of
cases
of
this
court
in
connection
with
immunity
requires
a
statement
within
the
jones
act
that
the
jones
act
is
particularly,
clearly,
and
unequivocally
applicable
to
the
states.
this
is
a
deviation
from
the
most
closely
aligned
cases
of
petty
and
parden
which
held
very
simply
the
other
end
of
the
spectrum,
that
in
the
event
that
the
government
chooses
or
elects
to
enter
into
a
federally
regulated
sphere
of
activity,
that
it
necessarily
subjects
itself
to
the
federal
regulations
which
congress
has
enacted.
in
petty,
for
instance,
even
though
there
is
some
distinguishing
factors
in
there
the
jones
act
was
the
key
issue.
the
individual
sued
a
bi-state
corporation
and
was
entitled
to
recover
with
language
by
this
court
indicating
that
unless
the
state
was
specifically
excluded
from
the
statutory
language,
then
the
individual
who
was
injured
had
the
right
to
proceed.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
yes,
your
honor,
it
is.
i
believe
that
the
opposite
ends
of
the
spectrum
are
the
parden
decision
and
the
atascadero
decision.
i
think
on
the
one
hand
where
the
court
said
if
you
choose
to
enter
into
this
activity,
you
are
going
to
subject
yourself
to
our
regulations,
whereas
on
the
other
hand
the
atascadero
decision
says
the
immunity
issue
is
not
going
to
be
waived
until
and
unless
congress
says
that
it
is
directly
and
unequivocally
applicable
to
the
states
as
defendants
under
the
jones
act.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
of
course
it
is
open
to
you.
i
think
that
is
one
of
the
options
that
the
court
has.
i
think
one
of
the
considerations
that
the
court
has
to
undertake
in
connection
with
overruling
parden
is
whether
the
provisions
of
article
3,
section
2
of
the
constitution
are
sufficient
to
allow
congress
to
completely,
totally,
and
exclusively
regulate
maritime
and
admiralty
matters
in
this
country,
and
that
is
the
critical
issue
here,
because
jean
welch,
the
plaintiff
in
this
particular
case,
has
no
remedy.
if
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
is
affirmed.
she
has
no
remedy
under
the
jones
act
in
connection
with
her
rights
as
a
seaman,
which
is
a
federally
protected
employee,
one
of
the
two
classes
of
federally
protected
employees.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
no,
your
honor,
they
do
not.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
it
was
an
option
to
the
plaintiff,
to
ms.
welch,
at
the
time
that
the
suit
was
filed.
there
are
state--
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
it
was
open,
but
there
is
language
also
in
the
state
court
in
the
concurring
opinion
of
judge
gee,
for
instance,
your
honor,
which
indicates
that--
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
--the
court
of
appeals.
that
the
state
law
in
texas
provides
that
my
client,
joan
welch,
has
only
the
right
to
pursue
an
exclusive
worker's
compensation
remedy.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
that
she
has
no
right
to
pursue
a
jones
act
claim
against
the
state
within
the
state
court
system.
therefore
the
election--
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
--it
was
indicated
first
of
all
your
honor,
in
the
district
court
level
by
the
decision
of
judge
sire,
who
was
also
one
of
the
authors
of
one
of
the
texas
appellate
court
decisions
before
he
took
the
district
court
bench,
and
that
foreclosed
the
issue
as
far
as
the
state
of
texas
is
concerned,
which
allowed...
which
precluded
jean
welch
from
filing
her
jones
act
suit
within
the
state
system.
it
is
clear
and
it
is
evident
that
there
is
nothing
within
the
legislative
history
of
the
jones
act
which
provides
that
congress
contemplated
that
the
jones
act
would
be
applicable
to
the
states.
however,
if
you
look
to
the
language
of
the
statute
itself
wherein
it
provides
that
any
seaman
shall
have
the
right
to
pursue
her
remedies
or
his
remedies
in
connection
with
injuries
sustained,
and
you
look
to
the
provision
of
the
statute
which
supplies
the
jurisdiction
in
federal
courts
in
connection
with
jones
act
claims.
that
in
the
petitioner's
estimation
is
sufficient
reason
to
allow
the
pursuit
of
jones
act
claims
against
state
employers
within
the
federal
court
system.
we
have
to
differentiate
between
the
substantive
and
the
jurisdictional
issues
which
were
raised
by
the
fifth
circuit
in
connection
with
their
affirming
the
dismissal
of
jean
welch's
complaint.
if
you
look
first
to
the
jurisdictional
issue
it
can
be
overcome
by
the
language
in
the
statute
notwithstanding
the
eleventh
amendment,
which
is
the
balancing
of
the
competing
interests
which
this
court
has
to
decide
will
prevail,
whether
the
individual,
jean
welch,
or
whether
the
state's
rights
are
going
to
be
subjected
to
the
fact
that
congress
has
exclusive
authority
over
admiralty
and
maritime
matters.
in
connection
with
the
substantive
matter,
because
texas
has
enacted
a
statute
which
says
you,
even
though
you
are
a
seaman,
jean
welch,
even
though
you
are
doing
traditional
maritime
duties,
even
though
you
are
in
the
position
that
we
know
that
admiralty
and
maritime
is
governed
by
congress
and
not
by
us,
you
have
no
jones
act
rights
in
this
state.
if
you
took
that
one
step
farther
and
affirmed
the
fifth
circuit
court
of
appeals
in
this
particular
case,
would
you
not
then
have
in
fact
deviations
in
connection
with
admiralty
and
maritime
matters
whereas
the
plaintiff,
for
instance,
in
the
state
of
texas
could
not
pursue
a
jones
act
right,
whereas
a
plaintiff
in
the
state
of
louisiana
could
pursue
a
jones
act
right
because
there
is
a
constitutional
waiver
of
immunity
in
louisiana,
but
can't
get
a
jury
trial
in
louisiana,
because
there
is
also
a
constitutional
amendment
in
louisiana
which
says
you
can't
try
a
jury
trial
against
a
state
agency
in
louisiana.
so
if
you
cross
the
border
you
are
in
a
position
where
you
have
no
jury
trial
in
louisiana
but
you
can
try
a
jones
act
case
against
the
state
in
that
state.
if
you
go
west
to
texas
you
can't
try
the
case
at
all.
she
is
limited
exclusively
and
entirely
to
worker's
compensation
remedies.
now,
what
results
is
a
derogation
of
the
congressional
intent,
objective,
and
purpose
to
maintain
complete
control
of
admiralty
and
maritime
matters.
any
other
result
which
could
be
reached
in
this
particular
case
is
going
to
result
in
either
one
of
two
things.
it
is
going
to
result
in
the
limitation
of
jones
act
claims
in
federal
court
against
state
employers,
that
is
that
the
court
will
overrule
parden
and
say
you
cannot
pursue
a
jones
act
complaint
in
federal
court,
period,
against
a
state
employer,
no
ifs,
ands,
or
buts,
following
atascadero,
there
is
no
language
in
the
statute.
or
the
court
will
have
to
compel
the
states
in
some
fashion
to
accept
the
jones
act
claims
against
their
employees.
alternative
is
very
simply
this
court
could
decide
that
even
with
the
eleventh
amendment
standing
in
the
way
of
a
jones
act
complaint
in
federal
court,
that
you
can
compel
the
states,
the
state
courts
to
accept
the
claim,
hear
the
claims,
and
litigate
the
claims
with
this
court
obviously
having
supervisory
appellate
jurisdiction
ultimately.
in
the
event
that
any
other
result
is
reached,
and
what
has
happened
is
that
there
has
been
a
judicially
carved
exception
in
which
jean
welch
falls
where
she
has
no
rights
and
she
has
no...
she
has
no
remedies,
but
she
has
the
rights
provided
her
by
congress
in
connection
with
the
jones
act.
the
respondent
in
this
case
says
very
simply
we
didn't
intend,
we
didn't
acknowledge,
we
didn't
waive
our
immunities.
it
is
the
position
that
they
have
to
take,
because
they
know
that
first
of
all
jean
welch
cannot
pursue
her
claim
in
state
court.
if
they
were
to
take
any
other
position
in
this
case,
in
connection
with
either
express
or
implied
waiver,
they
would
be
subjecting
the
state
and
its
agencies
to
the
jones
act.
the
question
arises
as
to
whether
or
not
the
two
named
defendants
in
this
case,
which
are
the
state
highway
department
and
the
state
of
texas,
can
be
separated.
could
the
court
in
this
instance
say
you
cannot
sue
the
state
of
texas
but
jean
welch,
you
can
pursue
your
case
in
federal
court
against
a
state
agency.
that
resolves
in
going
back
to
the
test
as
to
whether
or
not
ultimately
the
verdict
for
any
damages
would
be
paid
out
of
the
state
treasury.
this
court
in
the
eleventh
amendment
opinions
which
have
been
rendered
since
the
parden
and
the
petty
decisions
has
drawn
lines
in
various
forms--
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
--pardon?
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
no,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
no,
the
holding
of
petty
was--
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
--yes,
your
honor.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
as
a
jones
act
seaman
allowing
that
seaman
to
pursue
his
rights
in
federal
court
for
injuries.
the
distinction,
unfortunately,
in
connection
with
petty
from
our
side
of
the
case
is
very
simply
that
it
was
a
bi-state
corporation
which
had
a
sue
and
be
sued
clause
which
was
approved
by
congress.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
so
if
we
don't...
if
we
take
that
out,
and
if
you
have
a
narrow
reading
of
petty,
then
the
only
effect
of
it
as
far
as
this
particular
case
is
concerned
is
that
with
that
clause
and
with
congressional
approval
obviously
my
client
should
succeed.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
yes,
your
honor.
that
has
not
been
an
issue
of
dispute
although
it
was
assumed,
i
believe,
by
the
court,
because
this
case
was
cut
off
very
early
on
by
virtue
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
for
eleventh
amendment
immunity.
the
delay
was
because
there
a
another
party
in
it.
a
request
was
made
for
a
certification
in
order
to
appeal
immediately,
which
was
denied.
therefore
a
trial
was
concluded
against
the
other
party
before
final
judgment
was
rendered.
the
respondent's
position
in
connection
with
the
eleventh
amendment
versus
the
jones
act,
as
i
indicated
before,
is
that
because
there
is
no
legislative
intent
and
because
of
this
court's
decisions
in
atascadero
and
garcia
which
require
the
clear
and
unequivocal
language
to
waive
the
eleventh
amendment
that
obviously
it
is
a
case
which
should
be
affirmed
given
that.
the
difference
between
this
case
and
the
employees
case
and
the
edelman
case
and
the
line
of
cases
which
now
are
suggesting
that
there
must
be
a
clear
statement
is
the
fact
that
we
clearly
have
a
private
remedy.
we
have
an
individual
who
is
entitled
to
a
private
remedy,
that
is,
a
damage
suit
for
injuries
under
the
jones
act.
we
have
in
this
case
exclusive,
unquestioned,
never
deviated
from
authority
of
congress
to
regulate
admiralty
and
maritime
matters.
that
is
not
an
issue
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
we
certainly
do,
your
honor,
in
connection
with
the
issues--
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
--as
to
whether
or
not
we
have
a
seaman?
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
i
don't
believe
that
is
an
issue
in
this
case,
your
honor.
in
the
format
in
which
it
appears
before
this
court
by
virtue
of
the
motion
to
dismiss
on
the
eleventh
amendment
there
was
no
status
question
raised
as
obviously...
it
was
probably
premature.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
that
is
certainly
our
contention.
it
would
certainly
include
the
seamen
which
are
employed
by
the
united
states
government,
which
is
an
issue
that
has
been
raised
by
the
respondent
in
this
particular
case.
the
question
that
they
ask
in
that
particular
case
is
why
can
congress,
can
the
united
states
provide
only
a
compensation,
federal
employees'
compensation
remedy
for
that
seaman
whereas
the
state
can't
provide
it
for
its
seaman?
the
answer
is
pope
and
talbott
versus
hahn.
in
connection
with
that
particular
remedy.
the
second
answer
is,
because
of
the
fact
that
congress,
congress
alone
has
the
exclusive
admiralty
and
maritime
right
to
control
and
regulate
those
matters
in
this
country.
that
is
article
3,
section
2
of
the
constitution.
the
amicus
for
the
respondent
in
this
particular
case
suggests
that
this
court
reach
only
the
jurisdictional
issue
and
not
consider
any
merits
in
connection
with
jean
welch's
substantive
jones
act
rights.
if
the
court
were
to
do
that,
it
would
leave
open
obviously
the
issues
as
to
whether
or
not
jean
welch
or
any
other
state
employed
seaman
should
or
could
have
the
right
to
pursue
his
or
her
remedy
within
the
state
court
systems,
because
if
the
eleventh
amendment
does
in
fact
provide
the
state
with
that
particular
immunity
in
jones
act
claims,
then
again
the
result
would
be
to
carve
out
an
exception
for
state
seaman
unless
the
substantive
issue
or
the
substantive
portion
of
the
jones
act
is
reached
by
this
court
in
connection
with
this
particular
case.
consequently
what
we
propose,
what
the
petitioners
suggest
to
this
court
is
that
between
the
balancing
or
the
competing
interests
of
the
eleventh
amendment
and
the
jones
act
is
that
the
court
rule
either
that
states
which
provide
no
jones
act
forum
for
their
employees
are
in
fact
waiving
their
eleventh
amendment
immunity
because
of
the
substantive
rights
of
that
seaman,
or
vice
versa,
that
if
immunity
does
apply,
and
the
plenary
powers
over
commerce
and
admiralty
matters
of
congress
shall
be
washed
aside
in
this
case,
that
in
that
event
that
the
state
must
provide
a
forum
for
these
seamen,
because
otherwise
you
have
created
in
fact
the
exceptions
to
the
rule,
you
have
gone
beyond
the
purpose
and
the
scope
of
article
3,
section
2
of
the
constitution
and
said,
state,
you
have
blanket
immunity,
you
can
employ
all
the
seamen
that
you
care
to,
you
cannot
or
you
are
not
compelled
to
provide
a
remedy
for
them
as
congress
has,
and
a
state
such
as
texas
or
perhaps
one
such
as
louisiana
where
you
couldn't
get
a
jury
trial
if
you
were
a
seaman
there
employed
by
the
state,
the
flocking
would
begin
in
terms...
in
terms
of
the
effect
not
necessarily
of
the
financial
positions
of
the
state
because
one
of
the
purposes
of
the
eleventh
amendment
is
to
protect
and
preserve
the
financial
integrity
of
the
state.
what,
then,
would
the
effect
be
to
allow
the
seaman
who
is
employed
by
the
state,
the
very
few
which
are
employed
by
the
states
within
this
country
to
pursue
their
jones
act
remedies
within
the
federal
court
system?
isn't
it
so
that
the
effect
of
these
few
people,
these
lawsuits,
these
claims,
would
be
much,
much
less
significant
than
were
a
state
to
run
afoul
of
federal
revenue
sharing?
isn't
the
fiscal
integrity
of
the
state
now
more
dependent
upon
the
federal
government
than
upon
individual
claims
which

claims
act
or,
as
in
this
instance,
under
a
situation
where
one
of
a
few
number
of
seamen
has
a
substantive
right
granted
to
her
by
congress
which
she
seeks
to
assert.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
it
was
not
presented
as
one
of
the
questions,
your
honor,
and--
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
--it
is
a
collateral
issue
which
comes
with
the
constructive
or
the
implied
waiver
argument
quite
frankly
is
why
it
was
included
in
the
brief.
it
is
not
before
the
court
in
connection
with
the
express
waiver
in
terms
of
the
petition
for
certiorari.
in
the
event
that
the
fiscal
integrity
of
the
state
is
attacked
by
jones
act
claims
in
this
regard,
the
court
must
be
mindful
of
whether
or
not
that
fiscal
integrity
is
sufficient
to
overcome
the
balancing
act
between
the
states'
integrity
and
the
individual
rights,
and
that
is
essentially
what
we
have
here,
is
the
competing
interests
between
the
individual
versus
the
state.
the
immunity
issue
is
one
where
there
has
been
no
clear
line
drawn
because
even
with
the
employees
and
the
edelman
and
the
atascadero
and
the
garcia
decisions,
you
have
to
look
at
the
aberrations
of
the
decisions,
and
i
say
that
respectfully,
because
for
instance
in
utu
versus
long
island
railroad
anticipations
were
that
because
of
the
garcia
decision
and
the
decisions
of
national
league
of
cities
before
it
was
such
that
the
railway
labor
act
would
be
found
not
applicable
to
the
states
because
there
is,
again,
no
express
language
within
that
particular
statute.
and
faced
with
an
eleventh
amendment
immunity
issue
in
that
particular
case
the
court
said,
but
the
commerce
clause,
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
in
interstate
commerce
by
rail
is
one
which
is
unquestionably
relegated
to
the
federal
government
as
opposed
to
the
states.
isn't
that
the
same
thing
that
we
have
with
the
jones
act?
isn't
it
in
fact
incorporated
into
the
fela
insofar
as
the
remedies
available
to
the
employees
are
concerned?
if
you
take
that
case
and
you
apply
it
to
this
one,
then
obviously
the
result
would
be
that
the
eleventh
amendment
immunity
is
not
going
to
be
a
bar
to
jean
welch
in
federal
court,
or
to
mitigate
that
somewhat,
if
you
take
the
atascadero
language
and
requirements
of
clear
and
unequivocal
expression
of
waiver,
you
are
left
with
the
position
where
you
have
to
provide
a
forum
for
this
particular
individual
because
congress,
the
objective
of
congress
in
connection
with
the
jones
act,
the
objective
of
congress
in
connection
with
regulation
of
admiralty
and
maritime
matters,
is
that
it
shall
remain
with
the
federal
government.
the
federalism
issue
versus
the
state
issue
is
one
which
requires
very
simply
the
balancing
to
determine
whether
or
not
there
is
sufficient
interest
insofar
as
this
statute
is
concerned,
and
jean
welch
is
right,
to
pursue
or
to
overcome
the
shield
which
the
state
of
texas
has
put
forward
by
virtue
of
the
eleventh
amendment.
i
would
like
to
reserve
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
michael
d.
cucullu
may
it
please
the
court,
just
a
few
comments
in
response
to
respondent's
arguments
in
connection
with
several
of
the
issues
raised
in
this
case.
i
suggest
to
the
court
that
there
can
be
no
division
between
the
fela
and
the
jones
act
in
connection
with
the
remedies
provided
to
these
federally
protected
employees.
i
suggest
that
if
the
court
looks
to
u.s.
versus
california
and
southern
pacific
versus
jensen
and
utu
versus
long
island
railroad
and
petty
and
parden
that
they
must
conclude
that
the
rights
of
these
employees
are
rights
which
are
governed
by
the
commerce
and
admiralty
clauses
in
the
united
states
constitution
and
that
sets
them
apart
and
separate
from
the
fair
labor
standards
act
issues
in
some
of
the
cases,
employees
and
atascadero.
it
sets
it
apart
from
the
issues
which
are
raised
in
attorneys'
fees
cases
as
to
whether
or
not
the
private
cause
of
action
exists
for
the
individual
to
pursue.
it
sets
it
apart
from
the
cases
involving
the
federal
aid
to
the
blind
and
disabled
in
connection
with
private
remedies
because
congress
certainly
and
surely
intended
a
remedy
for
seamen.
and
that
remedy
was
the
ability
to
sue
his
or
her
employer
for
damages
if
injured
as
a
result
of
the
negligence
of
that
employer.
that
is
what
the
jones
act
is.
that
is
what
the
fela
is,
and
the
fela
is
no
more
explicit
than
the
jones
act.
when
the
jones
act
says
any
seaman
and
the
fela
says
any
employee
has
the
right
to
bring
this
particular
action.
no
other...
no
other
employee
class
in
this
country
is
federally
protected
as
these
two
particular
classes.
there
is
no
corollary
to
the
admiralty
and
maritime
jurisdiction
granted
to
congress
in
any
of
the
cases
subsequent
to
parden
and
petty.
there
is
no
case
which
falls
within
that
particular
realm
of
exclusive
jurisdiction
granted,
unquestionably
granted
to
congress
to
regulate
admiralty
and
maritime
matters.
and
this
alone
is
sufficient
in
petitioner's
suggestion
to
overcome
the
shield
of
eleventh
amendment
to
allow
jean
welch
to
pursue
her
case
in
federal
court
or
conversely
to
ensure
in
some
fashion
that
her
substantive
jones
act
remedies
are
provided
with
a
forum.
thank
you.
