mr.
haried,
what
is
the
policy
with
regard
to
locked
containers?
justice
stevens
you
break
the
lock
in
all
cases
and
open
the
briefcase
or
whatever
it
might
be?
justice
stevens
does
the
record
show
that?
justice
stevens
how
would
that
justification
apply
to
a
locked
briefcase?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
if
the
police
officer
noted
on
it
it
was
a
locked
briefcase,
presumably
if
it
was
picked
later,
why,
there
wouldn't
be
any...
i
don't
understand.
justice
stevens
but
at
the
time
he
made
the
inventory,
he
inventoried
it
as
a
locked
briefcase.
so
if
it
was
picked
it
would
have
to
be
picked
later.
justice
stevens
mr.
lazarus,
do
you
think
the
rationales
apply
equally
to
locked
containers?
justice
stevens
unlock
them,
break
into
them?
justice
stevens
well,
supposing
they
had
the
equipment
they
have
at
airports,
where
they
just
run
it
through
to
see
if
there's
a
gun
in
there
or
anything
like
that.
would
there
be
any
need
to
go
beyond
that?
justice
stevens
i
understand.
so
the
reason
is
just
one
of
administrative
convenience
when
it
comes
to
locked
containers,
when
they
could
find
out
otherwise?
justice
stevens
right.
justice
stevens
break
into
everything
is
the
routine.
justice
stevens
it's
to
avoid
the
problem
of
deciding
whether
a
container
is
locked
or
not,
in
other
words?
justice
stevens
may
i
just...
what
do
you
think
is
really
at
stake
in
this
case?
if
belton
would
have
justified
the
search
anyway,
how
many
cases
are
there
going
to
be
like
this?
does
it
really
just
apply
to
abandoned
vehicles,
do
you
suppose?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
are
there
many
cases
where
they
take
a
vehicle
in
without
arresting
its
driver?
justice
stevens
really,
we're
talking
about
abandoned
vehicles
as
the
category
of
cases
we're
concerned
with,
i
guess?
justice
stevens
how
do
you
leave
it
to
the
individual's
discretion
if
the
individual
isn't
around
the
vehicle
at
the
time
they
tow
the
vehicle
in?
how
do
you
find
out
the
answer?
justice
stevens
you
see,
the
thing
that
puzzles
me
is
the
facts
of
this
case,
everybody
seems
to
agree,
would
have
been
covered
by
belton
anyway.
and
i
don't
know
how
we're
going
to
get
many
cases
like
this
involving
arrests
where
you've
got
a
fight.
the
only
case
it
seems
to
me
that
may
be
relevant
is
the
overtime
parker,
and
i
don't
know
how
you
find
out
whether
you
get
a
consent
or
not
in
that
case.
i
guess
you
search
everything.
justice
stevens
i
guess
the
rule
is
that
people
who
are
concerned
about
their
briefcases
in
the
car
better
carry
plenty
of
change.
justice
stevens
could
i
ask
you
one
question,
since
you
were
kind
enough
to
stand
up.
supposing
the
container
was...
say
you
had
a
jewelry
salesman
and
the
container
had
a
label
on
it:
"this
contains
valuables.
"
"if
the
car
happens
to
be
impounded,
please
take
it
to
the
police
station.
"
could
you
open
it
and
search
it?
justice
stevens
for
what
reason?
