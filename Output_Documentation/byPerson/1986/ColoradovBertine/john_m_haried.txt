mr.
john
m.
haried
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
in
south
dakota
versus
opperman
and
in
illinois
versus
lafayette,
this
court
held
that
inventory
searches
are
lawful
if
they
are
routinely
done,
if
they
are
done
pursuant
to
standard
police
procedures,
and
if
they
are
done
in
furtherance
of
legitimate
governmental
interests,
and
if
they
are
not
a
pretext
for
an
investigative
search.
this
case
is
here
on
a
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
colorado
supreme
court
to
decide
the
narrow
question
of
whether
during
an
otherwise
lawful
inventory
search
of
an
automobile
it
is
permissible
for
a
police
officer
to
open
and
inventory
closed
containers.
mr.
john
m.
haried
we
did
not
urge
that
on
the
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
colorado
supreme
court.
mr.
john
m.
haried
yes,
i
do
think
it
would
have
been,
if
it
had
been
done
at
the
time
of
mr.
bertine's
arrest.
the
facts
were
that
it
was
done
some
15
minutes
or
so
after
his
arrest,
after
a
dog
control
officer
had
come
and
taken
the
dog
out
of
mr.
bertine's
vehicle.
mr.
john
m.
haried
i
do
not
know
if
there
was.
i'm
not
familiar
with
it.
mr.
john
m.
haried
it
was
basically
a
decision
of
the
facts
of
this
case,
that
the
intent
and
the
whole
thrust
of
the
search
was
an
inventory,
and
that's
the
grounds
on
which
we
sought
to
justify
it.
the
facts
in
this
case
are
that
the
defendant
was
stopped
because
of
his
erratic
driving,
and
he
was
eventually
arrested
for
drunken
driving.
he
was
taken
to
the
boulder
police
department
for
the
booking
procedure
and
for
a
blood
alcohol
test.
the
police
impounded
his
vehicle
because
where
it
was
left
when
he
was
arrested
it
was
blocking
traffic
on
a
busy
street
in
the
city
of
boulder.
the
boulder
police
department
regulations
provide
for
routine
inventory
searches
of
impounded
automobiles
and
their
contents.
and
during
the
search
in
this
case,
the
police
officer
found
mr.
bertine's
backpack
on
the
floor,
picked
it
up
and
could
tell
that
it
contained
personal
items,
and
he
opened
it
to
look
for
valuable
or
dangerous
items
for
inventory
purposes.
and
inside
he
found
a
hair
brush,
a
heavy
metal
flashlight,
clothing,
and
he
also
found
cocaine,
cocaine
paraphernalia,
quaaludes,
and
$700
in
cash
in
one
container
and
$200
in
cash
in
a
separate
container
on
a
pouch
on
the
outside
of
the
backpack.
the
trial
court
in
this
case
made
several
factual
findings
that
are
particularly
important
because
they
help
focus
the
issue
on
appeal.
the
trial
court
found
as
a
matter
of
fact
that
the
decision
to
impound
this
vehicle
was
made
in
good
faith,
and
that
it
was
made
for
the
purposes
of
protecting
mr.
bertine's
property,
protecting
the
police
from
false
claims
of
theft,
and
protecting
the
police
from
dangerous
items
that
might
have
been
inside
of
the
backpack.
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
officer
followed
the
standard
inventory
procedures
and,
importantly,
the
trial
court
found
that
this
search
was
not
a
pretext
for
an
investigative
search.
mr.
john
m.
haried
the
boulder
police
department
regulations
provide
that
if
a
vehicle
is
impounded
it
shall
be
inventoried,
and
the
trial
court
made
a
finding
that
that
meant
opening
closed
containers.
mr.
john
m.
haried
there
is
a
written
policy.
it
is
found
in
the
joint
appendix
at
page
88,
and
it
speaks...
the
language
of
it
says
that
the
vehicle
and
its
contents
shall
be
inventoried.
there
was
testimony,
which
is
in
the
record,
that
the
usual
practice
of
the
boulder
police
department
was
to
open
closed
containers
in
that
situation.
mr.
john
m.
haried
i
think
that
the
boulder
police
department
regulations
don't
spell
out
in
detail
the
word
"inventory".
i
think
if
you
read
them
as
a
whole,
as
the
trial
court
did,
you
reach
the
conclusion,
which
was
the
factual
finding
of
the
trial
court,
that
inventory
means
opening
closed
containers.
mr.
john
m.
haried
it's
the
same
policy.
mr.
john
m.
haried
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
haried
i
don't
believe
that
it
does.
it
wasn't
an
issue
in
this
case.
the
trial
court
considered
the
search
here
under
the
fourth
amendment
and
found
that
it
was
a
lawful
search
under
this
court's
ruling
in
illinois
versus
lafayette.
but
nonetheless,
it
suppressed
the
search
on
the
basis
of
the
colorado
constitution.
on
an
interlocutory
appeal
to
the
colorado
supreme
court,
that
court
affirmed
the
trial
court's
suppression
of
the
evidence,
but
did
not
base
its
decision
on
the
colorado
constitution.
instead,
it
based
it
solely
and
squarely
on
the
fourth
amendment.
the
colorado
supreme
court
specifically
said
that
it
did
not
reach
or
decide
the
state
constitutional
issue.
in
illinois
versus
lafayette,
this
court
held
that
in
the
course
of
an
otherwise
lawful...
that
during
an
otherwise
lawful
inventory
search
at
the
booking
desk,
it
was
permissible
for
police
officers
to
open
and
inventory
closed
containers.
and
our
position
is
that
the
same
reasons
that
supported
the
inventory
of
closed
containers
at
the
booking
desk
in
lafayette
apply
with
equal
force
here.
in
both
contexts,
both
at
the
booking
desk
and
on
the
street
when
a
vehicle
is
impounded,
the
same
basic
thing
is
happening.
the
police
in
the
exercise
of
their
caretaking
function
are
taking
physical
custody
of
a
citizen's
property.
and
as
a
result,
they
are
charged
with
responsibility
for
that
property,
responsibility
to
safeguard
it,
to
keep
it
from
being
stolen
or
destroyed,
and
the
responsibility
to
protect
against
the
risk
of
harm
from
dangerous
things
that
may
be
inside
the
property.
mr.
john
m.
haried
i'm
going
to
start
from
the
premise
that
locked
briefcases...
not
all
locked
briefcases
are
totally
secure.
in
other
words,
many
types
of
locks
and
briefcases
can
be
picked
or
combinations
can
be
opened,
so
that
no
container
is
secure.
and
there
is--
mr.
john
m.
haried
--well,
he'd
have
no
way
of
showing
that
it
was
picked
later.
but
more
importantly,
there
is--
mr.
john
m.
haried
--but
he
could
still
be
unjustly
accused
of
being
the
person
who
picked
it,
and
he'd
have
no
way
of
protecting
against
that.
but
there's
still
in
that
situation
the
important
governmental
interest
in
not
bringing
into
the...
police
station
containers
that
may
hold
valuable...
i'm
sorry...
that
may
hold
particularly
dangerous
items,
and
have
to
store
them
there,
because
then
the
police
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
what
it
is
they're
storing.
if
we
get
into
an
analysis
that
draws...
tries
to
draw
a
line
between
locked
and
unlocked
containers,
we
really
are
getting
into
a
worthy
versus
unworthy
container
analysis.
and
i
think
that
it's
important
in
this
type
of
search
to
have
a
bright
line
that
the
police
officers
can
follow
in
each
case,
so
that
they
don't
have
to
make
that
kind
of
a
judgment
and
they're
not
subject
to
later
accusation
or
being
second
guessed
about
that.
mr.
john
m.
haried
the
truck--
mr.
john
m.
haried
--only
the
valuable
things
or
particularly
dangerous
things.
for
example,
an
old
shirt
that's
lying
of
the
floor
they
don't
bring
that
in.
a
backpack
that
they
weren't
able
to
open
and
know
whether
it
contained
something
valuable
or
dangerous,
they
would
then
as
a
practical
matter
and
probably
so
that
they
aren't
negligent
have
to
take
that
in.
the
respondent
has
argued,
as
the
colorado
supreme
court
did,
that
in
the
booking
inventory
context
there's
a
greater
governmental
interest
in
opening
closed
containers
simply
because
of
the
need
to
prevent
weapons
or
contraband
from
getting
into
the
jail
population.
and
the
respondent
seems
to
say
that
the
only
way
that
the
police
can
prevent
that
from
happening
is
to
open
closed
containers.
his
argument
ignores
the
fact
that
the
governmental
interest
in
the
security
of
the
jail
could
be
adequately
served
simply
by
taking
the
container
away
from
the
arrested
person,
sealing
it
in
some
fashion,
and
storing
it
in
a
safe
place
outside
of
the
jail
population.
mr.
john
m.
haried
thank
you.
before
lunch
i
was
saying
that
the
defendant's
argument
about
the
security
of
the
jailhouse
could...
i
was
saying
that
that
interest
in
a
secure
jailhouse
could
adequately
be
served
simply
by
taking
closed
containers
from
an
arrested
person
and
sealing
them
and
putting
them
in
a
safe
place
outside
of
the
jail.
however,
in
illinois
versus
lafayette
this
court
refused
to
impose
such
a
less
intrusive
means
requirement
on
jail
personnel.
and
there
is
no
reason
to
impose
such
a
requirement
in
this
case.
it's
significant
to
note
also,
as
was
raised
in
justice
scalia's
question,
the
fact
that
when
containers
are
found
in
impounded
and
inventoried
automobiles
that
that
if
they're
going
to
be
kept
for
safekeeping
they
have
to
be
taken
to
the
police
department,
and
as
a
result
there
is
a
situation
that
is
substantially
the
same
as
that
in
illinois
versus
lafayette.
in
both
the
booking
inventory
context
and
the
automobile
inventory
context,
closed
containers
are
coming
into
the
jail.
and
in
both
situations,
it's
just
as
important,
it's
imperative
that
the
police
know
what
it
is
that
they
are
taking
custody
of
so
that
they
can
take
proper
measures
to
safely
store
it.
the
respondent
has
also
argued
that
closed
container
inventory
searches
during
inventories
of
automobiles
will
lead
to
a
parade
of
horrible
results.
this
is
not
true
because
there
is
already
criteria
in
the
case
law
that
would
limit
the
application
of
the
inventory
exception
to
particular
facts
and
situations.
and
lower
courts
have
been
in
the
past
and
will
continue
to
be
fully
able
to
apply
those
criteria
to
separate
the
lawful
inventory
search
from
the
unlawful
pretext
search.
mr.
john
m.
haried
it
was
taken
to
a
private
storage
and
impound
lot.
mr.
john
m.
haried
no.
mr.
john
m.
haried
no.
mr.
john
m.
haried
they
keep
them
under
the
building
that
houses
the
police
department.
it's
a
small
parking
area.
mr.
john
m.
haried
physically,
they
could
have
done
it.
as
a
practical
matter,
there's
not
nearly
enough
space
to
handle
all
the
impounded
automobiles
that
are
taken
in.
mr.
john
m.
haried
they
could
have
locked
it,
yes.
mr.
john
m.
haried
they
could
have
secured
the
pack.
they
would
have
had
to
have
made
a
decision
about
whether
to
leave
it
in
the
car
or
not
or
to
move
it
into
the
police
station.
mr.
john
m.
haried
they
opened
it
because
the
police
officer
didn't
know
if
there
was
anything
particularly
valuable
that
needed
safekeeping
or
anything
particularly
dangerous
that
also
needed
safekeeping,
because
from
the
outside
of
the
pack
there
was
no
way
of
knowing.
mr.
john
m.
haried
what
do
i
mean?
mr.
john
m.
haried
well,
for
example,
if
there
were
a
loaded
gun
inside
the
pack--
mr.
john
m.
haried
--no,
he
could
not.
mr.
john
m.
haried
the
danger
would
have
been,
if
by
some
accidental
means,
for
example,
a
loaded
gun
were
triggered
to
go
off
as
the
police
officer
is
handling
it
or
throwing
it
into
his
police
car
or
giving
it
to
the
property
custodian
or
something
like
that.
mr.
john
m.
haried
that's
correct,
it
was
a
backpack.
mr.
john
m.
haried
it
would
have
been
it
in
terms
of
holding
it
for
safekeeping.
but
the
other
government
interest--
mr.
john
m.
haried
--that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
haried
the
reason
is
because--
mr.
john
m.
haried
--that
is...
it
could
be
done
that
way,
but
it
would
not
serve
the
governmental
interest
because
the
police
would
have
no
way
of
establishing
what
it
is
they
had
initially
taken
custody
of,
and
they
would
have
no
way
of
knowing
how
to
store
that
item
or
how
to
handle
it.
mr.
john
m.
haried
how
do
we
know
that
it
was
not
for
those
purposes?
mr.
john
m.
haried
well,
the
trial
court
in
this
case
made
a
factual
finding
that
the
search
was
not
a
pretext
for
an
investigative
search,
that
it
was
done
in
furtherance
of
the
governmental
caretaking
interest.
mr.
john
m.
haried
i
agree,
it
involves
a
finding
of
law.
mr.
john
m.
haried
that's
right.
mr.
john
m.
haried
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
haried
absolutely.
mr.
john
m.
haried
that's
correct.
mr.
john
m.
haried
it
was...
the
car
was
moved
to
an
impound
lot,
which
in
this
case--
mr.
john
m.
haried
--it
was
secure
to
the
extent
that
a
fence
makes
any
area
secure,
but
it's
not
totally
immune
from
trespassers
or
vandals.
mr.
john
m.
haried
i
would
say
that
the
property
room
where
things
are
kept
is
about
as
safe
a
place
as
you
can
get.
mr.
john
m.
haried
you
could,
and
this
pack
was
eventually
put
there
after
it
was
inventoried.
mr.
john
m.
haried
that
is
correct.
mr.
john
m.
haried
we
did
not
need
to
search
it
to
put
it
into
the
property
room,
no.
but
you
did
need
to
search
it
in
order
to
know
whether
it
was
the
kind
of
thing
that
needed
to
be
put
into
the
property
room.
if
the
court
doesn't
have
any
other
questions,
i'd
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
m.
haried
no,
your
honor.
mr.
john
m.
haried
yes.
mr.
john
m.
haried
several
reasons.
one,
because
to
prevent
against
the
risk
that
the
police
may
be
falsely
accused
of
having
taken
something
out
of
the
container.
in
other
words,
if
there
were
say
two
pieces
of
jewelry
in
the
container
and
someone
coming
back
later
and
saying,
well,
there
was
only
one,
or
there
were
three
when
i
originally
gave
it
to
the
police,
something
like
that.
and
also
for
the
purposes
of
having
a
line,
a
clear
line
for
the
police
to
follow,
so
they
don't
have
to
get
into
those
worthy
and
unworthy
container
types
of
decisions.
