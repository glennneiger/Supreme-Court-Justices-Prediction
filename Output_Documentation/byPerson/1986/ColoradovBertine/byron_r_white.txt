justice
white
well,
you
also
want
to
know
what's
in
the
suitcase,
don't
you?
is
there
any
other
way
of
really
knowing
without
looking?
justice
white
you
might
be
able
to
use
a
scanner
that
would
tell
you
the
shape
of
something
or
whether
it's
metal
or
not,
but--
justice
white
--you
wouldn't
know
what's
in
some
bag.
justice
white
well,
what
do
you
do
with
these
tin
cans
or
these
containers?
do
you
just
leave
them
in
the
car?
justice
white
so
you
just
ignore
the
fact
that
they
might
contain
valuables?
justice
white
so
your
answer
to
my
question
is
yes,
leave
them
there?
justice
white
what
do
you
think
the
rule
is
in
the
police
station
when
you
arrest
somebody?
justice
white
why?
justice
white
suppose
you
open
a
backpack
in
the
police
station
after
arrest
and
you
see
these
very
containers.
now,
under
lafayette
you
can
search
them.
justice
white
why?
justice
white
exigency
about
what?
justice
white
well,
i
don't
accept
your
statement
that
there's
no
reasonable
suspicion
or
no
reasonable
possibility
that
these
containers
contained
anything
dangerous.
so
why
can
you
get
into
them?
justice
white
what
exigency?
justice
white
well,
i
know.
but
let's
just
posit
that
there's
no
real
possibility
of
having
anything
dangerous
in
this
tin
can
or
this
tin
container.
justice
white
then
what?
is
there
an
interest
in
knowing
what's
in
it
so
you
can
take
care
of
it
properly
or
not?
justice
white
i
think
you
really
are
suggesting
that
lafayette
ought
to
be
kind
of
chewed
up.
justice
white
well,
i
know,
but
you
take
this
briefcase
into
the...
or
you
take
this
backpack
or
the
cannisters
into
the
police
station.
there
you
are
in
the
police
station.
justice
white
along
with
him.
justice
white
it
seems
to
me
it
cuts
just
the
other
way.
i
would
think
that
there's
less
reason
to
worry
about
what's
in
the
backpack
when
it's
deposited
in
the
station
and
is
going
to
be
put
in
a
secure
safe
in
the
station
than
there
is
to
worry
about
what's
in
the
backpack
if
you're
going
to
leave
it
cut
on
the
public
streets
or
in
some
lot
that
is
easily
accessible
to
thieves.
if
there
is
a
loaded
gun
it
it,
when
it's
locked
up
in
the
station
there
won't
be
any
trouble.
but
if
you
leave
it
out
in
some
parking
lot,
it'll
get
in
the
hands
of
the
criminal.
i
think
it
cuts
just
the
opposite
way.
i
see
less
reason
to
worry
about
it
in
the
police
station
situation.
justice
white
well,
you
may
win
the
case,
whether
we
expressly
remand
or
not.
our
mandates
normally
say
that
the
case
is
going
to
go
back
to
the
court
from
which
it
came.
and
anything
that's
still
open
there
i
suppose
is
still
open.
