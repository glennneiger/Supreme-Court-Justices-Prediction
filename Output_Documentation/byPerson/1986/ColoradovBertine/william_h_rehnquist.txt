william
h.
rehnquist
you
may
proceed
now
whenever
you're
ready,
mr.
haried.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we'll
resume
there
at
1:00
o'clock,
mr.
haried.
we'll
continue,
mr.
haried,
where
you
left
off.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
very
well,
mr.
haried.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
rehnquist
now,
here
i
understood
there
were
packages
of
$700
and
$200
found.
so
that
quite
apart
from
whether
a
metal
detector
would
have
detected
that,
there
is
a
need
to
inventory
in
order
to
safeguard
it.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lacklen.
chief
justice
rehnquist
the
balance
should
be
struck
at
a
point
where
the
government
may
have
opened
one
container,
but
learned
absolutely
nothing?
when
they
opened
the
backpack,
as
justice
scalia
says,
it
seems
to
me
they're
no
further
ahead
than
before
they
opened
the
backpack.
chief
justice
rehnquist
so
it's
reasonable
to
open
the
backpack,
but
not
reasonable
to
open
the
nylon
bag?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
why?
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
it
isn't
just
dangerousness.
part
of
the
rationale
for
the
inventory
search
is
valuable.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
but
since
when
have
we
applied
the
less
intrusive
alternative
to
this
particular
kind
of
search?
chief
justice
rehnquist
yes,
but
that's
a
correct
inquiry
only
if
the
authorities
support
it.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
does
that
mean
that
every
single
inventory
search
then
has
this
kind
of
ad
hoc
analysis?
i
mean,
that
was
part
of
the
reason,
i
thought,
for
the
opperman
decision
and
part
for
the
lafayette
decision,
was
to
get
away
from
this
case
by
case
inquiry
and
set
up
some...
have
bright
line
rules
that
the
police
could
follow.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
that's
not
open
to
us
here,
is
it?
the
trial
court
did
make
the
finding
and
we're
ordinarily
bound
by
the
trial
court's
findings
of
that
sort.
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
you
make
this
argument
to
the
colorado
supreme
court
that
you're
making
here,
that
they
should
disregard
the
trial
court's
finding
that
it
was
good
faith?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lacklen.
mr.
haried,
do
you
have
anything
more?
you
have
four
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
haried.
the
case
is
submitted.
