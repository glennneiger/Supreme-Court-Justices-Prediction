justice
scalia
what
happens
to
all
these
materials
after
they're
inventoried,
assuming
that
it's
a
case
like
this
where
there's
a
truck
that's
going
to
be
towed
somewhere?
justice
scalia
do
they
bring
everything
that's
inventoried
to
the
station,
only
the
valuable
things
to
the
station?
justice
scalia
mr.
haried,
as
i
understand
it
the
officer
would
have
left
the
backpack
in
the
truck
if
it
didn't
contain
any
valuables,
right?
justice
scalia
but
he
wouldn't
want
to
leave
it
in
the
truck
if
it
contained
a
loaded
pistol,
would
he?
justice
scalia
because
somebody
might
come
along
and
get
it
and
obtain
a
loaded
pistol,
someone
who
shouldn't
have
a
loaded
pistol.
justice
scalia
so
that's
the
reason
he
had
to
look
at
it,
to
decide
whether
to
take
it
to
the
station
or
not?
justice
scalia
well,
what
use
is
there
in
opening
the
backpack
if
all
he
can
do
when
he
opens
the
backpack
is
to
note,
there's
a
nylon
bag
in
the
backpack?
that's
not
very
informative,
is
it?
i
mean,
if
there
is
some
purpose
in
examining
the
backpack
it's
to
find
out
what's
in
there.
simply
to
know
that
there's
a
nylon
bag
in
there
is
not
very
helpful,
right?
so
he
opens
the
nylon
bag
and
he
sees
tin
cannisters,
giving
no
indication
of
what's
in
them.
it's
not
very
helpful
to
know
that
there
are
tin
cannisters,
any
more
than
it
is
to
know
that
there's
a
backpack.
justice
scalia
i
understand,
but
i'm
asking
why
that's
so?
why
is
it
beyond
the
scope?
apparently
the
scope
would
consist
of
only
looking
in
the
backpack
and
seeing
that
it
contains
another
pack.
what
possible
interest
of
the
state
does
that
protect,
to
know
that
there's
a
bag
within
a
bag?
i
mean,
ultimately
the
state
wants
to
know
what
is
in
the
backpack.
you
don't
know
what's
in
it
simply
to
know
that
there's
another
container.
justice
scalia
i'm
saying
from
anybody's
point
of
view.
never
mind
just
the
prosecutor's
point
of
view.
it
seems
to
me
if
there
is
any
sense
in
the
exception
that
we've
made
for
an
inventory
search,
it's
rationale
is
that
the
police
are
entitled
to
know
what's
there.
now,
you
could
say
that
they
aren't.
if
you
want
us
to
strike
down
the
inventory
rule
entirely,
that
may
be
sensible.
but
if
you
have
an
inventory
rule,
surely
it
doesn't
make
any
sense
unless
you
can
find
out
what
is
there,
and
"what"
does
not
consist
of
a
nylon
bag
or
of
a
tin
can.
you
want
to
know
what
is
in
it.
justice
scalia
well,
what's
your
principle?
the
first
container
you
come
to
you
stop
at?
you
stop
at
the
backpack?
justice
scalia
but
you
can't
tell
if
all
you
see
in
it
is
a
nylon
bag.
justice
scalia
it
did
contain
valuables,
though,
didn't
it?
$700
or
so
one
of
them
contained?
justice
scalia
like
a
cigarette
pack?
justice
scalia
but
we've
upheld
that
in
one
of
our
cases,
at
a
station
house
to
be
sure.
but
the
principle
as
to
the
size
of
the
container,
surely
we've
overcome
that
obstacle
already.
justice
scalia
but
it's
not
inside
a
police
station,
either.
justice
scalia
so
it's
clearly
less
secure
than
the
place
where
the
cigarette
pack
is
going
to
go
in
lafayette.
justice
scalia
they
were
arresting
this
person
because
he
was
intoxicated,
correct?
justice
scalia
and
you
want
to
ask
him
in
his
intoxicated
state
whether
he
minds
whether
they
leave
his
valuables
on
the
street?
justice
scalia
and
you're
going
to
hold
him
to
whatever
he
says?
justice
scalia
that's
a
good
reason
for
not
adopting
an
inventory
rule.
i
mean,
you
might
say
that
as
a
prophylactic
measure,
since
it's
subject
to
abuse,
we
don't
have
any.
but
we
have
one,
and
what
i
don't
understand
is
what
is
the
intelligent
line
that
you
want
us
to
draw
in
the
inventory
rule
that
will
exclude
the
abuse,
but
allow
the
permissible
activity.
take
a
glove
compartment
in
a
car.
you
would
allow
them
to
open
the
glove
compartment?
justice
scalia
why
is
there
any
reason
to
believe
that
there
are
valuables
in
the
glove
compartment?
people
don't
usually
leave
valuables
in
their
glove
compartment,
or
they're
very
foolish
if
they
do.
justice
scalia
so
anything
that
can
be
taken
and
removed
to
the
station
must
be
taken
to
the
station?
that's
the
line
you
draw?
if
it's
integral
to
the
car,
you
have
to
leave
it
with
the
car,
but
if
you
can
remove
it
to
the
station
it
has
to
be
taken
to
the
station?
you'd
have
pretty
crowded
stations
around
the
country
if
every
loose
piece
of
equipment
that
you
can't
examine
in
all
these
cars
are
going
to
be
stored
there.
that
can't
be
the
rule,
can
it?
justice
scalia
i'm
still
not
sure.
that's
not
your
line,
then?
the
line
is
not
that
you
have
to
take
to
the
station
whatever
is
removable?
what
is
your
line?
you
have
to
have...
if
it's
removable,
it
has
to
look
as
though
it
contains
something
valuable,
is
that
it?
justice
scalia
okay.
only
that?
even
though
most
people
who
leave
things
valuable
in
the
car
certainly
wouldn't
put
it
in
a
container
that
looks
as
though
it's
valuable?
you
wouldn't
leave
something
in
a
car
in
a
gold
box,
would
you?
you'd
put
it
in
a
tin
can,
just
as
this
person
did.
that
doesn't
strike
me
as
a
very
sensible
rule.
justice
scalia
the
question
is
whether
joe
and
mary
tourist
would
prefer
to
have
their
valuables
taken
out
rather
than
left
somewhere.
i
expect
they
would.
justice
scalia
mr.
lacklen,
on
this
point
of
whether
the
colorado
supreme
court
got
into
the
pretextuality
issue,
what
does
that
suggest,
that
if
we
were
to
reverse
the
colorado
supreme
court
we
would
have
to
remand
for
them
to
consider
that
issue?
is
that
what
you're
suggesting?
justice
scalia
well,
the
colorado
supreme
court
clearly
held
that
this
was
not
a
proper
inventory
search,
that
even
if
the
inventory
aspect
of
it
was
not
pretextual
you
couldn't
have
an
inventory
search.
justice
scalia
so
i
don't
see
why
granting
certiorari
on
that
issue
was
improvident.
now,
let's
assume
we
disagree
with
you
on
the
outcome
of
that
issue.
what
do
you
suggest
the
disposition
should
be?
