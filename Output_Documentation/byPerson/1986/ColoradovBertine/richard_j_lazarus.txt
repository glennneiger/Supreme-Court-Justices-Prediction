mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
mr.
chief
justice,
may
it
please
the
court:
it
is
our
position
that
this
case
is
controlled
by
this
court's
decisions
in
lafayette
and
opperman.
respondent's
claim
that
the
search
of
his
backpack
violates
the
fourth
amendment
rests
at
bottom
on
the
proposition
that
a
routine
inventory
search
cannot
validly
extend
to
the
contents
of
containers
located
inside
a
lawfully
impounded
motor
vehicle.
according
to
respondent,
the
score
of
such
an
inventory
search
is
per
se
unreasonable
even
if
performed
pursuant
to
standard
police
department
procedures,
as
the
district
court
found
was
the
case
here,
and
not
a
mere
pretext
for
an
investigatory
motive,
as
the
district
court
found
was
not
the
case
here.
we
believe
that
respondent's
proposed
limitation
on
the
scope
of
valid,
routine,
inventory
searches
is
not
supported
by
the
fourth
amendment.
indeed,
we
believe
that
respondent's
view
has
in
principle,
if
not
in
fact,
already
been
squarely
rejected
by
this
court
in
lafayette
and
in
opperman.
no
doubt
for
this
reason,
since
this
court's
decision
in
lafayette
the
colorado
supreme
court
stands
virtually
alone
in
upholding
the
limitation
on
routine
inventory
searches
urged
by
respondent
here.
most
importantly,
as
petitioner
has
already
emphasized,
justifications
for
the
administrative
practice
of
inventory
searches
apply
with
full
force
to
the
inventorying
of
containers
taken
into
police
custody,
including
those
located
in
motor
vehicles.
such
searches
may
on
a
categorical
basis
be
needed;
first,
to
protect
the
owner's
property;
second,
to
protect
the
police
from
false
claims
of
theft;
and
third
and
finally,
to
protect
the
police
and
their
employees
from
the
dangers
associated
with
taking
into
custody
containers
the
contents
of
which
are
unknown...
virtual
trojan
horses.
in
opperman,
this
court
recognized
that
these
needs--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--yes,
we
do,
your
honor.
as
a
matter
of
fact,
it
is
the
policy
of
both
the
dea,
the
drug
enforcement
agency,
and
the
fbi
in
their
inventory
procedures
to
include
locked
containers.
the
basic
reason
is
the
distinction--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--to
break
in,
doing
minimum
damage.
the
basic
reason
for
that
is,
although
one
could
draw
a
line
there,
it's
not
unreasonable
not
to.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
we
think
it
would
be
a
mistake
to
require
that
kind
of
case
by
case
inquiry.
i
mean,
they
could
use
a
different
method,
but
the
question
here,
as
in
lafayette,
is
whether
the
constitution
requires
them
to
use
a
specific
less
intrusive
means.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right,
administrative
convenience
and
the
advantage
of
having
routine
procedures--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--opposed
to
trying--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--right,
but
the
basic
point
is
that
the
category
of
locked
containers
itself
would
involve
such
a
wide
variety
of
containers,
many
of
which,
like
suitcases
and
briefcases,
are
so
easily
susceptible
to
being
opened
that
it's
reasonable
for
the
police
to
have
a
procedure
which
takes
away
that
discretion
to
try
to
decide
which
ones
are
easily
openable
and
which
ones
are
not
and
just
say
all
locked
containers
should
be
open.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
whether
it
really
is
susceptible
to
being
opened.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
and
if
you
don't
open
it
up
you
cannot
be
sure
in
terms
of--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right,
your
honor.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
and
it
would
be...
the
continuing
needs
of
the
inventory
searches
apply
even
when
the
container
is
locked.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
facts
of
this
case
illustrate
that
quite
well,
how
a
container
that
was
giving
no
outward
indication
that
it
might
contain
a
valuable
in
fact
did.
in
opperman
this
court
recognized
that
the
legitimate
needs
of
the
inventory
search
justified
the
routine
inventory
search
of
a
motor
vehicle
in
police
custody.
in
lafayette,
this
court
recognized
that
these
same
needs
justified
the
routine
inventory
search
of
a
backpack
taken
into
police
custody
at
the
station
house.
we
see
no
reason
to
suppose
that
these
same
needs
don't
justify
an
inventory
search
of
basically
the
equivalent
of
the
lafayette
shoulder
bag
in
the
opperman
vehicle.
the
legitimate
and
fully
reasonable
need
for
the
police
to
learn
what
is
in
the
contents
of
a
container
taken
into
custody
does
not
magically
end
once
a
container
is
found
within
a
motor
vehicle,
nor
begin
only
when
the
container
is
itself
physically
located
at
the
station
house.
the
facts
of
this
case
we
believe
illustrate
both
principles.
in
this
case
the
police
were
in
lawful
custody
of
respondent's
motor
vehicle
and
its
contents
in
the
field,
and
had
to
determine
there
what
to
do
with
its
contents.
they
faced
a
purely
administrative
function.
it
was
plainly
reasonable,
we
believe,
for
the
police
in
deciding
what
property
in
the
car
to
take
for
safekeeping
in
the
property
room
in
the
station
house
to
inventory
the
contents
of
containers
they
found,
as
long
as
the
search
was
performed,
as
it
was
here,
in
a
manner
that
was
reasonably
confined
and
subject
in
scope
to
those
limited
ends.
the
contrary
view,
which
is
what
respondents
propose
here,
we
believe,
would
inevitably
lead
to
undesirable
judicial
management
of
routine
administrative
procedures
and,
even
more
fundamentally,
it
would
likely
lead
to
procedural
rules
that
would
be
incompatible
with
efficient
and
prompt
police
administration
of
their
caretaking,
non-investigative
function.
for
example,
respondents
propose
that
the
validity
of
a
routine
inventory
search
should
turn
on
a
case
by
case
inquiry
into
the
availability
of
less
intrusive
means.
such
a
requirement
would
be
fundamentally
incompatible
with
the
notion
of
a
routine
administrative
procedure.
inquiry
into
the
needs
of
the
police
in
a
particular
case,
such
as
that
undertaken
by
the
colorado
supreme
court
here,
into
the
subject
of
suspicions
about
the
contents
of
specific
containers,
the
availability
of
certain
towing
companies,
the
relative
records
of
various
towing
companies,
the
privacy
expectations
that
owners
might
have
with
respect
to
an
infinite
variety
of
containers,
would
inevitably
convert
a
routine
administrative
procedure
into
an
ad
hoc
process.
both
the
purposes
of
the
inventory
search
and,
ironically,
the
rationale
of
this
court's
acceptance
of
such
searches
would
both
be
defeated.
respondent
also
proposes
that
consent
should
be
a
prerequisite
to
a
valid
inventory
search.
of
course,
requiring
consent
would
be
tantamount
to
saving
that
inventory
searches
are
not
entitled
to
any
special
fourth
amendment
analysis,
because
consent
is
already
an
exception
to
the
fourth
amendment
probably
cause
and
warrant
requirements.
in
any
event,
as
this
court
has
recognized
already
in
opperman,
consent
does
not
recognize
or
address
the
legitimate
needs
of
the
police
to
protect
themselves.
no
doubt
for
these
reasons,
both
in
opperman
and
in
lafayette
this
court
has
already
squarely
rejected
the
constitutional
requirement
of
consent.
in
our
view,
the
sole
inquiry
in
each
case
should
be
threefold:
first,
whether
the
property
is
lawfully
in
police
custody
for
non-investigative
reasons;--
second,
whether
there
exist
routine
inventory
procedures
that
are
reasonable
in
scope
and
subject;--
and
finally,
whether
the
police
have
followed
these
routine
procedures
in
the
case
at
hand.
in
this
case,
all
three
inquiries
support
the
reasonableness
of
the
search
and
were
supported
by
findings
of
the
district
court.
accordingly,
we
believe
that
the
decision
of
the
colorado
supreme
court
should
be
reversed.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
