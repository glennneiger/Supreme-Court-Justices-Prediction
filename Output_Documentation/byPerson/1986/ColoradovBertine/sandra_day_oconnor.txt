justice
o'connor
mr.
haried,
may
i
ask
you
a
preliminary
question.
did
you
urge
below
or
did
the
state
urge
below
that
the
search
would
be
valid
under
belton,
a
search
incident
to
arrest?
justice
o'connor
why
not?
do
you
think
it
would
have
been?
justice
o'connor
well,
wasn't
there
a
case
from
arizona
that
dealt
with
a
delay,
that
recognized
the
concept
of
belton,
from
this
court?
justice
o'connor
i
was
just
very
curious
to
know
why
the
state
didn't
pursue
that.
justice
o'connor
were
there
procedures
in
place
for
when
containers
would
be
opened
or
whether
they
would
or
anything
of
that
sort?
justice
o'connor
is
there
anything
in
the
record
that
tells
us
what
the
policy
is,
other
than
that
general
conclusion?
was
that
conclusion
of
the
trial
court
supported
by
a
written
policy
of
any
kind?
justice
o'connor
was
there
any
testimony
by
the
officers
in
question
here
to
the
effect
that
they
had
a
slightly
different
policy
about
whether
to
open
containers
or
not?
it
just
wasn't
all
that
clear
to
me
that
there
was
a
clearcut
policy
on
this.
