mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
mr.
chief
justice
and
may
it
please
the
court:
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
understand
the
facts
of
this
case
before
it
rules
on
the
law
that
it
will
apply.
when
mr.
bertine
was
arrested
for
driving
under
the
influence,
he
was
handcuffed
and
placed
into
the
police
car
and
removed
from
the
scene.
a
backup
officer,
a
trained
narcotics
officer,
had
been
called
to
the
scene
by
the
arresting
officer.
officer
reichenbach,
who
was
put
in
control
of
mr.
bertine's
car,
waited
for
a
dog
impound
officer
to
remove
mr.
bertine's
animal
from
the
car
and,
long
after
mr.
bertine
had
left
the
scene,
he
started
what
he
called
an
inventory
search.
he
testified
at
the
hearing
that
that
inventory
consisted
of
him
going
into
the
truck
to
see
if
anything
of
interest
was
there.
he
checked
the
glove
compartment,
as
in
opperman,
and
then
he
immediately
went
to
the
backpack
that
he
found
behind
the
front
seat.
he
had
no
inventory
sheet
with
him.
he
didn't
begin
an
inventory
of
that
backpack,
and
the
trial
court
found
that
the
inventory
of
the
backpack
was
done
some
time
later,
after
the
search
of
the
backpack.
he
removed
the
backpack
from
the
truck,
took
it
back
to
his
patrol
vehicle,
and
opened
the
backpack.
but
that
wasn't
the
end
of
his
search.
he
opened
a
nylon
opaque
pouch
inside
the
backpack,
and
inside
that
found
four
containers.
those
containers
were
metal,
opaque,
lock-sealed
tin
cannisters,
four
by
one
by
three
inches.
he
opened
each
of
these
locked
containers,
clip-locked
containers,
individually
and
found
the
contraband
in
question.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
the
colorado
supreme
court
found
that
the
scope
of
the
intrusion
in
this
case
was
more
than
what
was
required
by
the
governmental
interest
of
protecting
mr.
bertine's
property
or
protecting
their
claims
against--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--clearly,
from
the
prosecution's
point
of
view
the
police
have
to
know
what's
in
every
small
container.
--our
argument
is
that
that
has
to
be
balanced
against
the
defendant's
legitimate
fourth
amendment
privacy
interests
in
those
containers.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
i
would
argue
that
the
scope
of
the
inventory
search
has
to
be
reasonable
in
and
of
itself.
in
this
case,
the
officer
testified--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--clearly,
the
backpack
could
have
been
intruded
upon
to
see
if
there
were
any
weapons
or
dangerous
instrumentalities.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
i
understand.
and
the
officer
went
beyond
the
nylon
bag
to
small
tin
cannisters
in
this
case
that
he
said
he
didn't
suspect
contained
dangerous
instrumentalities
and
didn't
suspect
contained
anything
particularly
valuable.
he
said
he
went
into
the
cannisters
because
he
was
curious.
and
i
think
the
fourth
amendment
clearly
protects
against
the
curiosity
of
an
investigating
officer.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
it
did
contain
money
and
contraband,
and
if
you
take
the
prosecution's
argument
to
its
logical
extension
there
is
no
container
of
whatever
size
in
an
inventory
that
the
police
cannot
search.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
that's
correct.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
clearly,
the
exigencies
of
the
search
of
the
cigarette
pack
in
lafayette
were
greater
than
in
this
case.
we're
arguing
that
the
court
has
to
balance
the
privacy
interests
that
have
been
upheld
in
chadwick
and
arkansas
versus
sanders
against
the
governmental
interest
to
learn
what's
inside
these
containers.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
i
think
that
a
reasonableness
test
on
the
nature
of
the
container
is
what
this
court
should
judge
the
intrusion
against.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
i
would
submit
yes,
because--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--because
the
nylon
bag
could
not
have
contained...
or
the
cannisters
that
were
actually
the
last
layer
of
container
opened
could
not
have
contained
anything
dangerous.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
i
understand,
and
we
feel
that
there
are
less
intrusive
alternatives
of
storage.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
clearly
there's
language
in
lafayette
that
says
that
the
court
in
the
abstract
is
not
going
to
be
governed
by
a
less
intrusive
alternative.
but
i
think
an
analysis
of
the
cases,
of
the
less
intrusive
cases
cited
in
opperman
and
in
lafayette,
make
it
clear
that
that's
one
of
the
factors
the
court
should
consider.
and
clearly
the
state
court
in
this
case
considered
that
there
were
less
intrusive
alternatives.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
i
would
agree,
and
on
the
facts
of
this
case
the
colorado
supreme
court
found
that
there
were
less
intrusive
alternatives
balanced
against
this
governmental
interest
to
find
out
what
was
in
the
cannister.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
we
would
agree,
and
i
think
our
argument
is
that
the
bright
line
rule
here
should
be
that
closed
containers
should
not
be
inventoried
in
a
situation
where
the
police
have
no
reason
to
believe
or
no
reasonable
suspicion
to
believe
that
the
container
contains
anything
dangerous.
the
mere
possibility
of
something
dangerous
or
something
valuable
being
inside
a
container
shouldn't
vitiate
the
fourth
amendment
interest
in
the
sealed
container.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
the
colorado...
yes.
the
regulations--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--well,
clearly
in
an
opperman
situation,
where
the
storage
lot
where
the
car
or
truck
was
being
taken,
that
would
be
unreasonable
for
the
police
to
have
to
do
that.
but
in
this
case,
the
storage
lot
was
surrounded
by
six
foot
fence--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--well,
there's
an
alternative.
you
can
leave
them
in
the
truck
and
take
them
to
a
secure
facility.
if
the
facts
of
the
particular
case
indicated
that
the
facility
was
not
secure,
such
as
in
opperman,
then
the
police
could
remove
the
backpack
as
a
unit
and
take
it
to
the
police
station
and
store
it
in
their
property
room
until
mr.
bertine
or
the
arrestee
is
released.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
clearly,
in
the
lafayette
situation,
where
the
person
is
being
booked
into
the
jail,
you
can
search
anything
that's
on
his
person.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
we
would
submit
that
the--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--clearly
you
can.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
clearly,
the
exigencies
in
the--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--of
danger
in
the
jail--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--well,
clearly
in
lafayette,
which
we
think
is
a
correct
decision,
in
the
jail
setting
the
exigencies
of
the
possibility--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--the
possibility
of
a
prisoner
getting
a
hold
of
a
dangerous
instrumentality
that's
in
a
container.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--we
would
submit
that
the
interest
in
taking
care
of
property
doesn't
outweigh
the
fourth
amendment
interest
in--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--no,
we're
in
total
agreement
with
lafayette,
because
it's
in
a
jail
setting.
the
prosecution
argues
that--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--clearly
the--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--clearly,
if
mr.
bertine
had
taken
his
backpack
with
him
when
he
was
arrested
by
officer
toporek,
it
would
be
covered
by
lafayette.
but
those
aren't
the
facts
of
this
case.
mr.
bertine
was
removed,
separated
from
his
backpack.
the
backpack
became
as
the
luggage
in
chadwick
and
sanders.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
we
would
submit
that
in
this
case
the
colorado
supreme
court
found
that
the
storage
lot
was
fenced,
lighted,
patrolled,
and
there
had
never
been
a
theft
from
any
of
the
vehicles
stored
in
this
particular--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--no.
clearly
if
the
car
had
been
towed
to
the
basement
of
the
police
station
it
would
be
more
secure.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
i
think
the
problem
in
lafayette,
the
way
would
analyze
that
case,
is
that
the
purse
was
in
the
police
station
and
the
police
had
an
obligation
to
deal
with
it.
part
of
our
argument
here
is
that
there
is
no
need
for
an
inventory
if...
unless
the
defendant
consents
to
it.
if
the
defendant
says,
i'll
waive
the
inventory
and
waive
whatever
liability
there
may
be,
then
the
governmental
interest
in
finding
out
what's
in
that
container
is
minimal.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
that's
correct,
he
was
arrested
for
driving
while--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--clearly--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--clearly,
the
waiver
of
the
liability,
if
he
would
be
doing
that,
could
be
done
even
in
an
intoxicated
state.
there
may
be
situations
where
the
defendant
is
comatose
or
not
available,
as
in
opperman,
and
clearly
the
police
have
an
obligation
at
that
point
to
perform
their
caretaking
function
and
secure
the
property.
in
this
case,
because
of
the
secure
nature
of
the
storage
facility,
the
police
clearly
would
have
been
acting
reasonably
to
store
the
car
with
the
backpack
in
the
storage
facility.
it's
clear
that
the
interests
in
this
case
are
different
than
the
interests
in
opperman
and
in
lafayette.
the
balancing
of
those
interests
must
be
weighed
in
the
context
of
what
this
case
represents,
a
field
inventory.
in
this
case,
as
was
not
present
in
opperman,
the
defendant
was
present
to
make
other
arrangements
for
his
truck
and
for
the
contents
of
the
backpack.
then
the
court
is
drawing
up
a
doctrine
in
this
case,
i
think
it's
important,
as
professor
lafave
has
pointed
out,
to
be
cognizant
of
the
pretext
danger
of
developing
a
doctrine
where
the
police
can
avoid
a
chadwick
or
sanders
or
even
a
belton
and
ross
analysis
by
delaying
the
search
until
the
car
or
the
backpack
is
in
the
hands
of
the
impound
officer.
this
invites
the
police
to
delay
their
searches
to
bring
it
under
the
rubric
of
the
inventory,
and
i
think
the
court
has
to
be
cognizant
of
the
threat
of
abuse
in
this
type
of
setting.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
yes.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
we
would
submit
that
the
glove
compartment
is
part
of
an
integral
part
of
the
vehicle
and
can't
be
separated
from
the
vehicle
itself.
the
glove
compartment
goes
with
the
car
to
the
storage
unit.
the
backpack
can
be
removed
and
taken
to
the
station.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
i
think
that
the
police
have
an
option,
depending
on
what
is
reasonable
under
the
circumstances.
and
in
this
case,
the
colorado
supreme
court
found
that
it
was
reasonable
to
leave
the
backpack
in
the
car
and
take
it
to
a
secure
storage
facility.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
our
argument
is
that
if
it
looks
like
it
contains
something
valuable,
it
should
be
removed
and
stored
at
the
police
station.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
clearly,
the
police
can
protect
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
privacy
interests
and
protect
their
own
interests
against
false
claims
or
property
by
either
storing
the
backpack
or
the
container
at
the
police
station
for
the
short
period
of
time
that
someone
arrested
for
a
minor
traffic
offense,
such
as
in
this
case,
would
be
in
custody.
the
argument
that
the
prosecution
makes
has
no
limits.
locked
containers,
locked
suitcases,
double
locked
footlockers
in
chadwick
and
sanders,
would
not
be
taken
away
from
the
scene
without
being
searched.
in
order
for
the
court
to
adopt
the
prosecution's
rationale,
we
wipe
away
the
doctrine
that's
been
carefully
constructed
under
lafayette,
under
chadwick,
belton,
ross,
sanders.
this
search
may
very
well
have
been
permissible
under
a
belton
analysis.
the
arresting
officer
said
he
wasn't
searching
incident
to
an
arrest.
the
trial
court
found
he
wasn't
searching
incident
to
an
arrest.
and
the
prosecution
has
abandoned
that
argument
both
in
the
colorado
court
and
in
its
briefs
in
this
court.
the
limitless--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--well,
there
are
many,
many
different
types
of
circumstances
where
the
police
come
into
contact
with
someone's
personal
property.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
i
think
there's
a
footnote
in
100,000
cars
were
towed
for
parking
opperman
violations,
traffic
violations,
in
new
york
city
in
one
year.
i
think
it's
clear
overtime
parking--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--well,
the
facts
of
this
case
clearly
are
limited
to
someone
being
arrested
for
a
minor
traffic
offense.
but
inventories
clearly
apply
across
the
board
to
all
sorts
of
situations,
and
that's
the
problem.
the
problem
is
is
that
people
who
do
no
more
than
park
overtime
on
constitution
avenue
after
4:00
o'clock,
joe
and
mary
tourist,
are
going
to
have
their
car
towed
and
their
personal
luggage
examined
under
this
rationale
of
the
police,
that
we
have
look
into
locked
suitcases
and
every
container
to
find
out
what
is
there.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
clearly
that's
something
that
should
be
left
to
the
individual's
discretion
and
his
consent.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
clearly
that
rule
doesn't
apply
in
the
facts
of
this
case,
and
i
think
opperman
was
a--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--clearly,
the
overtime
parker
or
the
comatose
accident
victim
is
an
exception
to
our
prerequisite--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--well,
not
overpark.
i
think
it's
important
for
the
court
to
understand
the
procedural
context
that
this
case
came
up
to
this
court.
the
trial
court
found
that
the
search
was
unlawful
under
state
constitutional
grounds.
that
was
the
only
issue
appealable
in
the
interlocutory
nature
of
this
case
when
it
reached
the
colorado
supreme
court.
the
defense
was
not
able
to
argue
that
the
trial
court
was
wrong
in
its
findings
of
law
regarding
pretext,
and
there's
clearly
at
least
the
suggestion
of
pretext
in
this
case.
officer
reichenbach
searched
the
backpack
in
this
case
and
then
took
his
inventory
form
back
to
the
vehicle
and
inventoried
the
vehicle.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
i
agree,
but
this
court
is
operating
in
a
vacuum
because
that
finding
has
never
been
reviewed
by
the
colorado
supreme
court.
i
think
that
if
this
court
finds
that
this
case
is--
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
--the
interlocutory
nature
of
that
appeal
prevented
the
defense
from
raising
any
findings
that
went
against
us.
the
only
findings
that
we
can
argue
on
interlocutory
appeal
in
colorado
are
findings
that
go
against
the
da
that
he
certifies
to
the
court.
so
we
were
left
without
a
remedy
in
the
colorado
court
for
the
findings
that
went
against
us
in
the
state
court.
so
the
pretext
comes
to
this
court...
the
pretext
nature
of
this
search
comes
to
this
court
in
a
vacuum.
there
has
been
no
review
of
those
findings
of
fact
and
law
by
the
trial
court
in
the
colorado
supreme
court.
and
clearly
there's
evidence,
at
least
the
suggestion,
of
a
pretextual
search
in
this
case.
the
officer
didn't
start
his
inventory
until
after
the
search
of
the
backpack
in
his
police
car.
in
fact,
the
contents
of
the
backpack
were
not
even
listed
on
the
impound
form.
they
were
listed
on
an
evidence
form
that
was
filed
in
the
case
itself
for
the
criminal
case
for
possession
of
cocaine.
we
submit
to
the
court
that
on
the
facts
of
this
case
the
doctrine
that
this
court
should
apply
is
that
a
consent
to
inventory
is
a
prerequisite
for
a
valid
inventory
search.
that
alleviates
the
need
to
balance
the
container
issue.
if
the
court
decides
to
reach
the
container
issue,
we
would
ask
the
court
to
fashion
a
doctrine
that
properly
balances
in
the
field
inventory
context,
not
in
the
automobile
exception
context
and
not
in
the
incarceration
jailhouse
context,
properly
balances
the
defendant's
fourth
amendment
interests
that
have
been
upheld
in
luggage
in
chadwick
and
sanders
against
the
governmental
interests...
protect
themselves
against
false
claims,
loss
of
property,
or
the
possibility
of
dangerous
instrumentalities.
the
mere
possibility
of
dangerous
instrumentalities
in
these
kind
of
containers
clearly
argues
too
much.
if
you
adopt
the
prosecution's
argument,
then
the
police
can
search
containers
in
any
situation,
even
in
investigative
situations
such
as
chadwick,
because
you
don't
know
if
the
double-locked
footlocker
contains
a
dangerous
instrumentality
when
you
take
it
into
your
possession
to
store
it
at
the
police
station.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
i
would
suggest
that
this
court
could
send
this
case
back
to
the
state
court
as
certiorari
improvidently
granted,
because
this
case
can
clearly
be
analyzed
under
belton
and,
although
that
has
not
been
briefed
and
we
don't
think
that
belton
applies,
clearly
the
inventory
nature
of
this
case
is
somewhat
muddled
by
the
way
that
the
case
came
to
this
court.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
that's
correct.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
the
case
clearly
has
to
be
remanded
to
the
state
court,
because
the
state
court
didn't
rule
on
the
state
constitutional
grounds
on
which
the
evidence
was
originally
suppressed.
if
the
da
were
to
go
back
to
trial
today,
after
a
reversal
of
the
colorado
supreme
court,
he
still
wouldn't
have
any
evidence,
because
the
trial
court
suppressed
the
evidence
on
state
constitutional
grounds.
and
we
would
disagree
with
the
district
attorney
on
the
clearness
of
the
colorado
state
ruling.
it
would
be
our
submission
that
the
colorado
court,
although
citing
the
fourth
amendment,
said
that
the
colorado
constitution
may
exclude
this
evidence
also.
and
so
it's
not
clear
that
the
prosecution
wins
even
if
this
court
issues
what
may
be
an
advisory
opinion
on
this
issue
to
the
colorado
supreme
court.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
well,
we're
still
trying
to
figure
that
one
out
in
colorado.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
yes,
and
we
would
submit
that
the
wording
of
his
ruling
is
ambiguous.
it's
clearly
not
the
kind
of
clear
and
adequate
state
around
statement
that
we
would
have
liked
under
michigan
v.
long.
but
we
think
that
what
he
says
is
we
need
not
decide
the
issue
of
whether
the
colorado
constitution
provides
greater
protection
than
the
fourth
amendment,
because
we
find
that
the
fourth
amendment
provides
sufficient
protection
to
hold
this
search
unreasonable.
mr.
cary
c.
lacklen
it
would
be.
and
all
i'm
suggesting
is
that
because
of
the
search
incident
to
an
arrest
possibilities
in
this
case,
because
of
the
pretextual
vacuum
of
the
facts
regarding
the
regulations
themselves,
and
because
of
the
state,
possible
separate
state
constitutional
grounds,
that
certiorari
may
have
been
improvidently
granted
in
this
case.
thank
you.
