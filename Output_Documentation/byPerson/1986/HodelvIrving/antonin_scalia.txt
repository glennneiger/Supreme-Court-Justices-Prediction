justice
antonin
scalia
you
said
a
little
bit
earlier
that,
and
your
briefs
maintain
this
position,
that
the
prospective
heir
has
no
property
right--
justice
antonin
scalia
--which
could
form
the
basis
of
an
action
for
taking
by
the
united
states.
therefore
the
claims
here
which
are
pressed
by
prospective
heirs
after
the
death
rest
upon
the
rights
of
the
decedent
rather
than
the
heirs
themselves.
what
is
the
basis
on
which
these
heirs
are
allowed
to
have
standing
for
assertion
of
the
rights
of
other
individuals?
justice
antonin
scalia
but
they
are
contending
that
the
unconstitutional
taking
occurred
when
the
statute
was
passed.
if
it
occurred
at
all,
that
is
when
it
occurred,
right,
and
at
that
time
no
property
was
taken
from
them.
justice
antonin
scalia
the
taking
occurred
at
the
time
of
the
escheat?
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
are
saying
then
they
do
have
standing
in
their
own
capacity.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
the
government
accepts
that.
is
that
the
general
proposition
of
third
party
standing?
you
can
always
assert
the
standing
of
a
third
party
who
is
now
deceased?
justice
antonin
scalia
i'm
not
either.
justice
antonin
scalia
why,
because
that
party
should
have
standing?
that
party
has
been
deprived
of
something?
but
you
have
just
said
that
party
hasn't
been
deprived
of
anything,
that
that
party
had
no
property
right.
justice
antonin
scalia
i
am
still
trying
to
find
out
what
it
is
that
distinguishes
this
case
from
other
third
party
standing
cases
which,
you
know,
pose
a
real
problem.
it
surely
is
not
the
fact
that
there
is
injury
in
fact.
i
mean,
there
is
always,
virtually
always
in
these
suits
some
injury
in
fact.
justice
antonin
scalia
that
relationship
being
that
some
of
them
would
have
been
the
intestate
heirs
but
for
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
and
some
of
them
would
have
been
devisees
but
for
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
mr.
kneedler,
i
hate
to
come
back
to
the
same
thing,
but
i
am
still
hung
up
on
the
standing
point.
you
say
that
the
connection
between
decedent
and
potential
heir
is
what
is
different
here.
now,
we
have
before
us
a
takings
claim.
the
taking
could
be
rendered...
the
problem
could
be
solved
either
of
two
ways,
striking
down
the
taking
or
requiring
compensation
for
the
taking.
justice
antonin
scalia
now,
there
are
some
particular
problems
in
this
case
as
to
whether
congress
has
prescribed
compensation,
but
let's
assume
that
it
hasn't.
if
compensation
were
awarded
for
the
decedent's
injury,
i
presume
that
compensation
would
be
awarded
to
the
decedents.
justice
antonin
scalia
to
their
estate,
and
not
to
these
plaintiffs.
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
it
wouldn't,
because
you
validate
the
statute
by
awarding
compensation
for
the
statute,
right?
justice
antonin
scalia
so
the
compensation
would
go
to
the
decedent's
estate.
justice
antonin
scalia
whereupon
it
would
pass
pursuant
to
the
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
my
point
is,
the
compensation
would
go
to
the
decedent
and
would
not
necessarily
reach
these
plaintiffs,
which
makes
it
very--
justice
antonin
scalia
--yes,
if
they
were
asserting
their
rights,
but
they
are
not
asserting
their
rights.
they
are
asserting
the
rights
of
the
decedent,
and
to
compensate
for
the
rights
of
the
decedent
you
compensate
the
decedent's
estate.
justice
antonin
scalia
not
these
plaintiffs.
so
you
are
allowing
these
plaintiffs
to
sue
to
compel
the
government
to
give
compensation
to
somebody
else,
and
that
does
not
strike
you
as
strange?
justice
antonin
scalia
ms.
war
bonnett,
do
you
ask
for
compensation
as
opposed
to
striking
down
the
statute?
justice
antonin
scalia
no,
but
in
this
case
do
you
want
compensation
or
do
you
want
the
statute
struck
down?
justice
antonin
scalia
and
my
next
question
is
going
to
be,
if
you
want
compensation,
who
ought
to
be
compensated,
because
you
are
asserting
before
us
the
rights
of
the
decedents--
justice
antonin
scalia
--not
the
rights
of
your
clients.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
never
mind
the
standing
analysis
for
the
moment.
just
answer
my
narrow
question.
to
whom
should
the
compensation
go
if
we
award
compensation?
why
should
it
go
to
your
client?
justice
antonin
scalia
to
be
distributed
under
the
valid
statute.
justice
antonin
scalia
well,
you
can't
have
both.
you
can't
both
strike
down
the
statute
and
get
compensation
for
the
taking
that
the
statute
effects.
surely
you
can't
do
both.
if
you
get
compensation,
you
have
to
let
the
statute
stay
in
effect.
justice
antonin
scalia
counsel,
may
i
ask
about
your
assertion
earlier
that
the
outcome
here
should
be
affected
by
the
fact
that
in
1889
the
indians
weren't
given
the
land
for
free,
but
in
effect
gave
compensation
for
it.
but
property
is
normally
acquired
in
such
a
transaction
for
compensation.
suppose
an
individual
buys
land
from
the
state
of
new
york.
could
the
state
of
new
york
thereafter
alter
its
inheritance
laws
so
that
the
individual
can't
dispose
of
the
property
which
he
paid
compensation
for
the
way
he
previously
could?
