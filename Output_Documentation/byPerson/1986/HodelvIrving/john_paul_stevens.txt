mr.
kneedler,
can
i
just
ask
one
question
about
the
authority
to
dispose
of
property
by
will?
could
an
owner
of
one
of
these
shares
or
pieces
of
real
estate
will
it
to
anyone
he
chose?
is
there
any
restriction
on
the--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--before
the
act
was
passed,
what
was
the
restriction,
if
any?
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
could
an
owner,
for
example,
give
all
of
his
interest
to
his
oldest
child,
or
something
like
that,
in
order
to
try
and
prevent
the
division
into
very
small
interests?
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
about
that
statute,
because
there
is
one
thing
that
puzzles
me
on
it.
what
kind
of
notice
did
the
members
of
the
tribe
get
about
the
impending
change
in
the
law
that
would
affect
their
ability
to
transfer
their--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--well,
both
in
this
one
and
the
earlier
statutes
you
just
referred
to.
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
then
what
about
this
one?
what
kind
of--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--if
someone
died
in
the
interval
between
the
instructions
were
out,
the
act
would
have
become
effective
immediately?
justice
john
paul
stevens
mr.
kneedler,
isn't
there
some
tension
between
your
suggestion
that
presumably
the
decedents
would
have
wanted
to
do
something
different
and
your
suggestion
that
the
decedents
presumably
understood
the
statute,
because
part
of
your
argument
was
that
if
they
wanted
to
do
something
different
they
have
got
every
right
to
do
so,
but
you
must
be
assuming
there
were
a
lot
of
decedents
who
didn't
really
have
notice
of
what
the
statute
was
going
to
do
to
their
interests.
justice
john
paul
stevens
if
you
presume
they
knew,
and
say
we
are
talking
about
people
who
wanted
to
do
something
six
months
later,
what
is
the
injury
then?
how
are
they
injured
if
they
just
went
ahead
and
let
the
statute
go
into
effect
which
is
what...
they
probably
would
be
happy
to
have
the
tribe
have
their
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
but
your
willingness
to
recognize
standing
would
treat
the
strongest
case
as
the
indian
who
did
not
realize
that
such
a
statute
had
perhaps
affected
his
property
rights.
he's
the
one
who
might
well
have
done
something
different,
and
therefore
didn't
carry
out
his
own
desires.
that
is
the
one
i
suppose
you
have
the
most
difficult
time
defending
the
statute
on
its
merits
because
it
might
not
give
him
adequate
notice
of
what
was
happening.
justice
john
paul
stevens
that
right
didn't
arise
in
1889.
that
arose
in
1910,
didn't
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
it
went
into
effect
long
before
1910,
didn't
it?
and
there
was
a
period
of
ten
or
twenty
years
when
they
could
not
will
the
property.
justice
john
paul
stevens
are
you
in
effect
claiming
a
breach
of
contract?
justice
john
paul
stevens
a
breach
of
the
1889
treaty,
in
effect?
justice
john
paul
stevens
yes.
justice
john
paul
stevens
may
i
ask
if
the
tribe
has
ever
participated
in
this
litigation
and
taken
a
position
on
this
issue?
justice
john
paul
stevens
what
position
did
they
take
in
the
eighth
circuit?
were
they
in
favor
of
getting
the
property
or
against
it?
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
if
they
don't
want
the
property
why
couldn't
they
just
reallocate
it
in
accordance
with
the
desires
of
the
former
owners
then?
justice
john
paul
stevens
i
know,
but
if
there
are
transfers
that
would
produce
property
interests
of
more
than
2
percent
the
secretary
presumably
would
approve--
justice
john
paul
stevens
--i
see.
justice
john
paul
stevens
well,
they
paid
for
the
property
in
the
texaco
case,
too.
i
mean,
the
fact
they
paid
for
the
property
i
don't
really
think
makes
much
difference.
justice
john
paul
stevens
let
me
ask,
since
you
have
mentioned
texaco,
which
probably
is
not
one
of
the
most
widely
read
opinions
that
we
have
ever
issued,
by
the
way,
that
if
your
opponent
did
now
rely
on
a
due
process
rationale,
trying
to
defend
the
judgment
below,
would
that
argument
be
open
to
your
opponent,
do
you
think?
justice
john
paul
stevens
do
you
think
it
would
be
open
to
the
court
to
affirm
on
that
ground
if
the
court
thought
there
were
merit
to
the
argument?
