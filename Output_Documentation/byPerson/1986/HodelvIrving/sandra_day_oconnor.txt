day
o'connor
mr.
kneedler,
are
there
any
limits
in
your
view
as
to
what
the
government
can
do
or
change
concerning
the
descent
of
property
belonging
to
indians?
do
you
think
the
government
has
plenary
power
to
really
make
any
kind
of
a
regulation?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
do
you
take
the
position
that
it
can
be
abolished?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
mr.
kneedler,
do
you
think
that
the
lack
of
notice
problem
might
somehow
enter
into
the
balance
that
the
court
has
to
employ
in
determining
the
validity
of
this
provision?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
ms.
war
bonnett,
you
didn't
make
a
due
process
attack
on
this
statue
in
the
courts
below,
did
you?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
the
parties
that
you
now
represent
made
no
such
claim
in
the
courts
below.
isn't
that
correct?
justice
sandra
day
o'connor
well,
you
are
not
suggesting
that
this
court
should
go
off
on
some
due
process
ground,
are
you?
