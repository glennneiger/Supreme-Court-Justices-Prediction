chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
we
will
hear
arguments
first
this
morning
in
number
85-637,
donald
p.
hodel
versus
mary
irving.
mr.
kneedler,
you
may
proceed
when
you
are
ready.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
these
undivided
interests?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
mr.
kneedler,
does
it
make
some
difference
in
your
submission
that
the
statute
here
did
not
provide
for
it
to
escheat
or
whatever
you
want
to
call
it
to
the
united
states
but
to
the
tribe?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
has
this
court
ever
held
that
lack
of
notice
was
a
defense
on
the
part
of
someone
challenging
the
constitutionality
of
a
statute
governing
the
descent
of
property
upon
death?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
kneedler.
ms.
war
bonnett,
we
will
hear
from
you
at
this
time.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
are
you
saying,
then,
ms.
war
bonnett,
that
these
were
not
undivided
interests,
that
they
had
been
partitioned?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
why
don't
you
come
back
to
the
microphone
when
you
reply?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but,
ms.
war
bonnett,
there
is
no
question
here,
is
there,
that
congress
intended
the
result
which
it
produced
in
this
most
recent
statute?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
yes,
so
there
is
no
way
by
interpretation
that
we
can
say
that
whatever
inconsistency
there
was
between
this
statute
and
the
1889
statute
and
1910
statute
can
be
somehow
read
favorably
to
the
indians.
your
claim
has
to
be
a
constitutional
one.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
i
was
interested
in
getting
your
answer
to
one
of
justice
stevens'
questions
where
he
asked
you,
do
you
claim
a
breach
of
the
1889
statute
or
treaty,
and
you
said
yes.
well,
congress
can
breach
a
statute
or
a
treaty
by
a
subsequent
statute
unless
it
effects
a
taking,
can't
it?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
right.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
to
the
extent--
--to
be
unconstitutional
as
applied
to
these
particular
decedents,
then,
but
constitutional
as
to
those
who
have
had
an
adequate
time
to
adjust
their
affairs?
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
but
if
your
claim...
you
stress
so
much
the
lack
of
notice.
certainly
the
government
can't
decide
that
it
is
going
to
take
every
tenth
person's
property
and
put
out
a
notice
to
that
effect
saying
we
won't
do
it
for
a
year
and
have
that
be
sustained
just
because
there
was
adequate
notice
of
it.
a
taking
is
a
taking
in
a
certain
sense
regardless
of
whether
there
is
notice,
and
if
it
is
not
a
taking,
it
seems
to
me
the
fact
that
you
do
not
now
make
any
due
process
claim
and
haven't
one
in
the
courts
below
makes
the
notice
question
pretty
low
on
the
totem
pole.
perhaps
this
is
the
wrong
case
to
say
that.
