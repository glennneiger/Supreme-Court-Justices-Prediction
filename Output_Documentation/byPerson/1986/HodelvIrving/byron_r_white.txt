you
wouldn't
care
if
we
just
called
it
a
reversion?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
statute
calls
it
escheat?
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
tribe
would
get
the
property.
justice
byron
r.
white
and
the
heirs
would
get
the
money.
justice
byron
r.
white
but
the
property
would--
justice
byron
r.
white
--escheat
to
the
tribe.
justice
byron
r.
white
like
the
statute
says.
justice

white
like

justice
byron

white
how
do
you
distinguish
texaco,
or
do
you?
or
do
you
think
it's
even
relevant,
texaco
against
indiana?
justice
byron
r.
white
the
net
effect
of
the
statute,
the
state
statute
in
texaco,
was
that
the
property
interests
were
lost.
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
here
the
property
owners
could
have
saved
their
property
by
taking
some
steps.
justice
byron
r.
white
that's
the
only
real
point
of
distinction
between
this
case
and
texaco?
justice
byron
r.
white
isn't
the
respondent
entitled
to
support
the
judgment
on
any
ground
that
is
apparent
from
the
record,
or
not?
or
is
this
apparent
from
the
record?
justice
byron
r.
white
well,
i
know.
it
may
be
late,
but
that
is
the
way
a
lot
of
these
respondent
cases
are.
