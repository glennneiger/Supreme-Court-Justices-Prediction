justice
harry
a.
blackmun
counsel,
the
government
in
its
primary
brief
didn't
even
cite
texaco.
justice

so
are
they
relying
on
it?
they
did
cite
it
in
the
reply
brief,
not
in
the
primary
brief.
justice
harry

maybe
i
should
ask
the
question
of
your
opponent
as
to
why
they
didn't
cite
it
if,
as
justice
white
indicates,
there
may
be
some
precedent
there.
i
had
the
same
reaction.
may
i
just
ask
this?
supposing
this
statute
had
read...
they
use
the
word
"escheat"
in
a
rather...
not
a
very
precise
way,
the
congress
did
here.
supposing
they
had
used
the
word
"abandoned"
instead
of
"escheat",
and
they
just
said
that
after...
if
an
owner
of
one
of
these
interests
does
not
convey
it
to
another
member
of
the
tribe
within
such
and
such
a
period
of
time
he
shall
as
a
matter
of
law
be
deemed
to
have
abandoned
it,
and
then
it
would
come
right
within
texas
against
short,
wouldn't
it?
