mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
thank
you,
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
this
case
is
here
on
direct
appeal
from
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eighth
circuit.
that
court
held
unconstitutional
an
act
of
congress
that
was
passed
in
1983
to
address
what
congress
perceived
to
be
the
serious
adverse
consequences
for
indian
reservations
resulting
from
the
increasingly
fragmented
ownership
of
indian
allotments.
the
statutory
provision
involved,
section
207
of
the
indian
land
consolidation
act
of
1983,
provides
for
the
escheat
to
the
tribe
concerned
of
certain
de
minimis
fractional
undivided
interests--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--yes,
i
think
escheat
is
an
accurate
term.
escheat
is
typically
defined
to
mean
the
reversion
to
the
state
of
interests
in
property
where
there
is
no
heir
qualified
to
receive
it,
and
in
this
instance
congress
has
determined
by
reference
to
the
size
of
the
property
interest
involved
that
no
heir
should
be
qualified
to
receive
the
property
at
the
time--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
tribe
is
not
guardian
of
the
individual
indians'
estate.
the
united
states
is
trustee
for
the
particular
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
oh,
i
am
sorry.
that
is
what
the
analogy
would
be,
yes,
that
the
tribe
is
the
local
unit
of
government;
in
addition
to
being
the
membership
organization
is
also
the
local
unit
of
government
and
the
responsible
entity
on
the
indian
reservation,
and
congress,
i
am
sure,
believed
that
it
was
better
to
have
the
property
interest
escheat
to
the
tribe,
the
unit
of
government
closest
to
the
indian,
and
the
unit
of
government
from
which
the
land
first
came,
and
which
has
the
responsibility
for
the
indian
rather
than
to
the
united
states
government
in
fee.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
the
label
is
important.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
statute
does
call
it
escheat.
it
would
also
be
possible
to
characterize
it
as
congress
having
designated
the
tribe
as
the
heir,
the
statutory
heir
of
the
interests
when
the
indian
dies.
however
it
is
characterized,
congress
has
chosen
to
keep
the
property
in
indian
hands
rather
than
to
have
it
continue
to
descend
to
individual
indians
in
very
small
portions.
the
court
of
appeals--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--under
the
act
the
only
thing
that
escheats
is
an
interest
that
represents
2
percent
or
less
of
the
overall
allotment
and
has
earned
less
than
$100,
or
in
fact
under
the
amended
act
is
incapable
of
earning
in
the
next
five
years
more
than
$100.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
allotments,
yes.
well,
it
depends
again
how
one
would
define
as
small.
the
allotments
under
the
general
allotment
act
were
typically
160
acres
for
a
head
of
a
family,
smaller
amounts
to
others.
under
the
sioux
allotment
act
at
issue
here
the
allotments
were
320
acres
for
heads
of
families,
so
2
percent
of
a
160
acre
allotment
would
be
two
or
three
acres.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
these
are
undivided
interests.
these
are
not
interests
that
have
been
partitioned.
there
are
provisions
under
the
regulations
for
partition
of
indian
allotments
in
certain
circumstances,
but
the
ones
we
have
here
are
undivided
interests.
the
court
of
appeals
held
that
this
escheat
provision
effects
a
taking
of
property
in
violation
of
the
fifth
amendment
to
the
constitution
because
of
the
absence
of
compensation.
we
submit
that
it
does
not,
and
that
section
207
is
in
fact
an
exercise
by
congress
of
the
traditional
power
of
the
sovereign
that
has
been
repeatedly
recognized
by
this
court
to
regulate
the
devolution
of
property
upon
the
death
of
the
owner,
and
beyond
that
we
submit
that
it
represents
a
reasonable
exercise
by
congress
of
its
unique
responsibilities
on
behalf
of
indians
to
prevent
a
fragmentation
policy
that
has
inhibited
the
economic
development
of
indian
reservations.
this
problem
arose
by
virtue
of
provisions
in
the
original
allotment
acts,
the
general
allotment
act
having
been
passed
100
years
ago,
in
1887,
and
the
sioux
statute
in
1889.
to
prevent
improvident
alienation
of
the
allotments
and
to
protect
its
tax-exempt
status,
congress
provided
for
the
allotments
to
be
retained
in
trust
status
by
the
united
states
for
25
years
subject
to
extension
for
ten
years
by
the
president,
but
because
of
this
period
of
trust
status
in
the
beginning
congress
provided
for
the
disposition
of
the
property
at
death,
even
in
the
original
acts,
by
stating
that
the
property
would
pass
to
the
allottee's
heirs
in
accordance
with
the
laws
of
the
state
where
the
property
is
situated.
this
had
the
effect
of
incorporating
the
state
law
of
intestate
succession
into
federal
law.
then
in
1910
congress
enacted
a
statute
that
for
the
first
time
authorized
allottees
to
dispose
of
their
property
by
will.
thereafter
the
allotment
policy
was
repudiated
most
profoundly
in
the
indian
reorganization
act
of
1934,
and
for
tribes
that
chose
to
come
under
the
ira
and
the
allalla
sioux
tribe
in
this
case
was
one
such
tribe,
the
act
had
the
effect
of
extending
indefinitely
the
trust
period
for
indian
allotments,
and
also
preventing
further
allotment
of
the
lands,
although
congress
did
enact
25
usc
483,
which
permits
an
individual
who
owns
an
interest
in
an
allotment
to
apply
to
get
a
fee
patent
to
the
land
and
have
it
partitioned
or
to
sell
it,
so
it
has
not
been
frozen
in
trust
status
irrevocably.
the
heirship
provisions,
though,
had
the
effect
of
causing
the
breakup
or
the
fractionation
of
the
interests
from
generation
to
generation.
typically
what
happened
either
under
the
heirship
statute
or
the
provision
for
disposition
by
will
is
that
the
original
allottee's
interests
was
divided
among
his
heirs
or
devisees
in
undivided
interests,
and
then
when
each
of
those
heirs
or
devisees
died
his
interest
in
turn
was
subdivided,
so
that
over
the
course
of
l00
years,
with
each
passing
generation
these
interests
become
further
divided,
and
that
is
vividly
illustrated
by
the
facts
of
this
case.
the
interests
that
escheated
by
appellee's
decedents
in
this
case,
in
one
instance
the
de
minimis
interests
would
subdivide
among
seven
heirs,
that
is
in
the
case
of
the
named
appellee
here,
irving,
thirteen
heirs
in
the
case
of
appellee
pumpkin
seed.
so,
this
shows
that
today
if...
in
the
absence
of
this
statute
these
interests
would
continue
to
further
subdivide.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
there
are
several
restrictions.
under
the
1984
amendments
to
the
indian
land
consolidation
act,
one
of
these
de
minimis
interests
may
be
willed
only
to
another
person
who
owns
a
fractional
interest
in
the
particular
allotment.
this
was
designed
to
be
consistent--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--the
principal
restriction
derived
from
section
4
of
the
indian
reorganization
act,
which
has
recently
been
amended,
but
in
general
provided
for
the
property
to
remain
in
indian
hands.
it
could
descend
only
to
a
member
of
the
tribe,
to
the
tribe
itself,
and
it
has
been
amended
to
provide
for
heirs
under
state
law.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
he
could
do
that.
and
there
also
are
some
special
statutes
on
some
reservations.
on
the
yakima
reservation
there
was
a
statute
that
was
involved
in
simmons
versus
seletze,
which
was
unanimously
affirmed
by
this
court.
that
was
an
instance
where
the
yakima
tribe,
there
was
a
special
statute
to
prohibit
the
passage
of
any
land
to
anyone
with
less
than
one-quarter
yakima
blood,
and
in
that
case
because
the
heirs
at
law,
the
children
and
grandchildren
did
not
possess
that
qualification,
the
land
in
question
escheated
to
the
yakima
tribe,
so
the
operation
of
that...
in
that
particular
case
was
very
much
like
that
one
here.
it
escheated
pursuant
to
a
statute
enacted
by
congress
back
in
1942
that
provided
where
an
indian
dies
intestate,
without
heirs,
that
the
property
escheats
to
the
tribe,
so
this
is
not
the
first
instance
in
which
congress
has
chosen
that
way
of
disposing
of
property.
congress
identifies--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--in
this
case?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
1942
one?
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
1942
one
i
don't
know.
it
has
been
on
the
books
for
a
long
time,
and
people
are
presumed
to
know
the
existence
of
a
statute
such
as
that.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
in
this
one
soon
after
the
act
was
passed
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs
sent
out
to
all
area
supervisors
and
to
all
superintendents,
there
are,
i
don't
know,
12
or
13
bia
areas,
and
then
superintendents
are
responsible
for
particular
reservations,
instructions
explaining
the
way
this
would
work
and
some
of
the
alternatives
that
could
be
pursued
by
individuals
to
avoid
escheat,
and
then
the
instructions
encouraged
the
area
superintendents...
or
the
superintendents
and
the
area
directors
to
notify
people
on
the
reservations
of
the
consequences
of
the
act.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
the
act
was
effective
on
its
effective
date,
but
that
is
not
unusual
with
respect
to
laws
governing
the
distribution
of
property
at
death.
they
typically
take
effect
immediately,
and
the
potential
heirs
of
someone
have
no
vested
right
to
receive
property
and
the
property
passes
according
to
the
law
that
is
in
effect
at
the
time
of
death.
this
is
unlike
the
situation
of
texaco
versus
short
or
united
states
versus
lock,
which
was
not
dealing
with
a
situation
where
there
was
death
and
property
had
to
pass.
it
was
dealing
with
another
type
of
situation
where
a
person
or
the
owner
during
his
lifetime
would
take
some
voluntary
action
and
may
have
needed
notice,
but
the
court
has
not
suggested
that
the
same
sort
of
situation
arises
with
respect
to
the
distribution
of
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
no,
our
submission
does
not
go
nearly
that
far.
the
court
has
described
the
power
of
the
legislature
over
the
descent
of
property
in
very
broad
terms,
suggesting
that
the
right
to
pass
property
and
to
receive
it
by
descent
or
by
will
is
creation
of
statute
and
not
a
natural
right,
it
is
a
privilege
that
can
be
conditioned
or
even
abolished,
but
the
court
has
never
been
confronted
with
a
situation
where
it
had
to
address
that,
and
it
isn't
here.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that
is
not
part
of
our
submission
here,
no.
what
we
have
here
is
a
situation
where
congress
is
really
dealing
at
the
margin.
the
basic
allotment
that
was
made
under
the
allotment
act
substantial
sort
of
interest,
something
approaching
160
acres
or
even
something
far
smaller
than
that
continues
to
pass,
so
the
original
understanding
of
the
allotment
act
remains.
this
statute
deals
with
consequences
that
were
not
contemplated
when
the
allotment
act
passed.
the
interest
had
become--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
don't...
we
did
not
intend
for
that
language
to
be
taken
to
its
full
implications.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
this
is...
congress
obviously
can...
i
think
there
is
an
element
of
reasonableness
in
anything
congress
does
in
a
situation
such
as
this
in
terms
of
defining
who
may
be
qualified
to
take
property,
what
sort
of
property
can
pass,
and
within
reasonable
limitations.
the
court
has
taken
the
same
approach
with
respect
to
the
taxing
of
estates,
and
because
the
legislatures
have
typically
responded
in
a
reasonable
fashion
and
a
responsible
fashion,
and
it
is
our
submission
that
congress
did
here
as
well,
we
are
not
suggesting
here
that
congress
could
simply
pass
a
statute
providing
for
all
property
to
escheat
to
the
government
after
one
generation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
we
think
that
is
an
important
element
of
it.
for
one
thing,
that
distinguishes
this
case
from,
for
example,
the
sioux
nation
case
that
this
court
had
four
or
five
years
ago
where
the
property
was
actually
taken
effectively
by
the
united
states.
here
the
fact
that
the
property
passes
to
the
tribe
we
think
serves
to
show
that
this
is
an
aspect
of
the
reasonable
regulation
and
adjustment
of
benefits
and
burdens
on
the
reservation
by
having
the
property
pass.
it
is
not
as
if
the
united
states
has
invaded
the
property
in
some
sense
and
taken
it
for
itself.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
tribe,
just
as
the
individual
who
owned
it,
would
need
the
consent
of
the
united
states
to
either
sell
it
or
to
lease
it,
so
that
the
property
remains
restricted
whether
it
is
in
individual
hands
or
tribal
hands.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
outright,
no.
it
remains
in
trust
status.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
this...
there
is
some
question
about
that.
it
arose
in
part
because
the
case
was
not
brought
as
assertion
of
the
rights
of
the
decedent.
it
was
brought
as
an
assertion
of
the
rights
by
the
appellees
to
have
a
vested
right.
both
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
rejected
that,
and
the
appellees
aren't
pressing
that
here,
but
even
though
they
are
asserting
the
rights
of
the
decedents,
it
is
true
that
but
for
the
statute
or
some
other
action
by
the
decedent,
property
would
pass
to
the
heir.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
the
taking-i
think
they
would
say
occurred
when
the
property
escheated,
not
because
the
land
might
have...
the
decedent
might
have
done
something
between
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act
and
the
time
of
death
to
provide
for
an
alternative
disposition
of
the
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
because
it
could
be
avoided
between
the
time
of
the
passage
of
the
act.
the
act
does
not
affect
the
right
of
the
owner
of
the
fractional
interest
to
sell
it
during
his
lifetime,
to
give
it
away,
to
purchase
other
interests
that
would
bring
his
ownership
above
the
2
percent
level
to
avoid
escheat,
so
the...
it
wasn't
until
the
time
of
escheat--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
they
are
still
asserting
the
rights
of
the
decedent
to
dispose
of
the
property
in
the
way
that
he
chooses,
but
their
claim
is,
because
the
decedent
is
not
alive
any
longer
to
assert
his
interest
in
doing
that
that
they
should
be
permitted
to
assert
that
right
on
his
behalf.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
well,
i
am
not
sure
that
i
would...
i
am
not
sure
what
the
full
ramifications
of
that--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
in
this
case
where
the
property
would...
where
the
person
asserting
the
right
would
receive
the
property
but
for
the
operation
of
the
statute,
it
was
our
view
that
at
least--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--he
didn't
have
a
property
right
but
he
had
an
interest.
he
was
injured.
he
was
injured
in
fact,
the
argument
would
be,
by
the
operation
of
the
statute.
now,
i
acknowledge
that
there
is
an
additional
problem,
and
that
is
that
the
appellee
can't
be
sure
that
the
decedent
wasn't
content
to
have
his
property
escheat,
and
that
you
can't
be
sure
that
it
was
actually
the
statute
rather
than
the
decedent's
choice
to
abide
by
the
statute
that
resulted
in
the
loss
of
the
property.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
beyond
injury
in
fact
there
is
a
nexus
between
the
decedent
and
the
plaintiffs
in
this
case.
they
are
either
the
heirs
at
law
or
the
devisees
of
the
decedent,
so
there
is
a
relationship
established
by
law
or
will
between
the
decedent
and
the--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--or
devisees
but
for
the
statute.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
that's
right,
but
it
does--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--no,
i
didn't
mean
to
suggest
that.
it
is
possible
that
in
the
first
weeks
or
months
after
the
statute
was
passed
there
were
some
who
didn't
know,
but
this
became
a
widely
publicized,
widely
known
provision
within
several
months
after--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--well,
if
not
happy,
at
least
not
concerned
enough
to
do
something
about
it,
yes.
that
is
the
contingent
element
of
that
may
well...
could
be
viewed
as
an
ingredient
of
the
standing
problem
or
could
be
viewed
as
a
problem
on
the
merits.
i
mean,
i
think
it
may
well
go
to
both.
it
certainly
undermines
the
suggestion
that
there
is
some
automatic
acquisition
of
the
property
or
deprivation
without
any
opportunity
for
the
individual
landowner
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
we
have
submitted,
we
don't
believe
that
notice
is
an
element
with
respect
to
a
statute
of
this
sort.
i
think
we
should
acknowledge
that
this
is
sort
of
an
awkward
position
or
situation
that
arose
in
the
court
of
appeals
because
the
court
of
appeals
held
the
statute
unconstitutional
on
grounds
that
were
not...
was
not
really
the
subject
of
litigation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
might
be
an
element,
yes,
and
certainly
in
a
case
like
lock
and
texaco
versus
short
it
was
an
element,
but
again,
in
a
situation
where
you
have
property
passing
at
death,
the
ownership
of
the
property
passes
anyway,
and
it
is
a
particular
transaction
that
is
traditionally
the
subject
of
the
sovereign's
power,
and
the
idea
of
notice,
i
think,
is
a
less
important
element
in
that
setting.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
not
to
my...
not
to
my
knowledge.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
right.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
but
then
that
compensation--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--but
it
would
pass
through
the
estate.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
the
compensation
would
pass
pursuant
to
the
heirship
statutes
or
pursuant
to
the
will.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
may
not
necessarily,
but
the
premise
of
the
argument
as
i
understand
it
is
that
heirs
and
devisees
they
would
receive
the
real
property,
so
i
believe
it
would
be
part
of
their
claim
that
they
would
receive
the
substitute
for
the
real
property
in
the
form
of
compensation.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
it
is
unusual,
but
then
the
operation
of
the
statute
is
unusual,
and
we
are
not
urging
a
broad
theory
of
third
party
standing
here,
and
we
have...
congress
enacted
a
statute
whose
constitutionality
we
believe
should
be
sustained
by
the
court,
and
it
has
been
our...
the
court
of
appeals
reached
the
merits.
we
have
decided
to
principally
address
the
merits
in
our
submission.
if
there
are
no
further
questions
at
this
time,
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time
for
rebuttal.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
yes,
i
do
have
several
points
i
would
like
to
make.
in
response
to
the
question
about
texaco,
in
retrospect
we
certainly
should
have
cited
texaco.
the
account
in
our
opening
brief
of
the
operation
of
the
statute
and
the
alternatives
available
and
the
other
factors
correspond
rather
closely
to
texaco.
i
would
like
to--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--i
think
not.
it
was
not
raised
below.
it
was
not
raised
in
the
motion
to
affirm.
and
in
fact
it
is
not
really
raised
in
the
argument
section
of
the
brief
here.
it
is
described
in
the
statement,
but
not
really
in
the
argument
section.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
don't
think
the
court
could
affirm
on
that
ground.
i
think
the
most
that
the
court
should
do
would
be
to
remand
for
proceedings
on
that
particular
issue.
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
i
think
it
would
not
be
apparent
from
the
record,
and
it
does
come
a
bit
late
at
this
point.
as
we
have
said,
we
don't--
mr.
edwin
s.
kneedler
--as
we
say,
this
is
not
a
situation
like
texaco
where
notice
is
an
important
ingredient,
we
think,
because
laws
regulating
the
descent
of
property
typically
happen
automatically
at
the
moment
of
death,
and
the
legislature
does
not
normally
provide
a
grace
period
when
it
changes
the
rules
of
descent,
even
though
they
might
substantially
unsettle
the
decedent's
expectations
of
where
his
property
was
going
to
go.
i
would
like
to
respond
to
several
points
that
were
made.
one
is
the
filing
by
the
tribe
in
the
court
below.
the
tribe
wanted
or
said
that
these...
it
should
not
receive
these
properties
without
compensation.
well,
nothing
in
this
statutory
scheme
prohibits
the
tribe
from
making
compensation
to
individual
members
if
it
chooses.
another
alternative
that
is
open
to
the
tribe
under
the
1984
amendments
is
to
pass
a
statute
providing
for
an
alternative
disposition
of
these
interests
rather
than
having
them
escheat.
one
possibility
would
be
to
have
them
descend
by
intestate
succession
to
other
owners
of
fractional
interests
in
the
same
parcel,
which
would
prevent
the
further
fragmentation
of
interest.
with
respect
to
justice
powell's
questions
about
the
possible
sale
of
the
property
to
others,
there
are
alternatives
other
than
sale.
one
is
to
give
it
away,
to
exchange,
which
would
require
no
monetary
investment
at
all
to
assemble
a
more
substantial
interest,
or
to
purchase
ones
from
others,
all
of
which
could
cause
the
interest
to
rise
above
the
2
percent
level,
and
if
there
are
obstacles
to
the
sale
of
the
land,
for
instance,
that
may
well
reflect
nothing
more
than
the
problems
created
by
the
very
fractionated
ownership
that
this
statute
was
designed
to
protect
against.
one
of
the
principal
problems
that
congress
was
responding
to
was
the
inability
to
sell
these
parcels
of
land
and
the
fragmentation
of
ownership
and
the
assembly
of
tracts
that
could
be
economically
used,
just
as
in
lock
and
in
texaco
versus
short.
we
think
for
the
reasons
stated
in
our
opening
brief
and
reply
brief
that
appellees
are
quite
wrong
to
say
that
the
sioux
allotment
act
had
some
unique
contractual
element
that
the
general
allotment
act,
which
it
really
mirrors,
did
not
have.
the
language
was
drawn
directly
from
the
general
allotment
act.
this
court
in
jefferson
versus
fink
said
that
did
not
create
any
contractual
rights,
and
there
is
no
evidence
from
the
background
that
congress
intended
to
contract
away
or
that
the
sioux
understood
that
congress
was
contracting
away
its
right
to
regulate
the
descent
of
indian
property.
but
it
is
important
to
point
out
that
even
vested
rights,
as
this
court
said
in
texaco
and
lock,
the
retention,
the
permanent
retention
of
private
ownership
rights,
the
legislature
can
condition
that
retention
on
the
performance
of
certain
affirmative
acts
which,
among
other
things,
would
negative
any
suggestion
of
abandonment.
and
one
of
the
characterizations
congress
used
of
the
fractionated
ownership
or
fractionated
interest
when
it
enacted
this
statute
was
that
there
is
an
element
of
abandonment
to
them.
the
individual
owners
don't
occupy
the
land.
they
receive
a
check.
it
is
an
entirely
passive
relationship
which
is
not
conducive
to
a
personal
responsibility
or
nexus
to
the
land,
which
is
what
congress
was
hoping
for
when
it
passed
the
allotment
act.
so
this
statute
actually
furthers
the
purpose
of
the
general
allotment
act
and
the
sioux
allotment
act.
