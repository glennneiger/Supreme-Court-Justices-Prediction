ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court,
what
i
first
want
to
place
before
the
court
today
is
the
significance
of
these
property
interests
in
terms
of
the
decedents,
charles
pumpkin
seed,
chester
irving,
edgard
pumpkin
seed,
and
geraldine
cross,
and
then
also
in
terms
of
the
appellees
who,
but
for
section
207
of
the
indian
land
consolidation
act,
would
have
inherited
these
interests.
when
you
translate
the
percentage
figures
and
the
dollar
limitations
of
the
indian
land
consolidation
act
into
everyday
terms
and
in
terms
of
the
values
of
the
decedents,
and
you
take,
for
example,
charles
pumpkin
seed,
who
had
nine
interests
which
were
subject
to
transfer
to
the
tribe
under
this
act,
those
interests,
this
2
percent
or
less
interest
amounted
to
one-third
of
an
acre
all
the
way
up
to,
one
of
his
interests
was
the
size
of
four
and
a
half
acres.
the
other
decedents
had
similar
ranges
in
terms
of
the
size
of
the
interests
that
they
were...
that
were
subject
to
transfer
to
the
tribe
under
the
law.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
no,
i
am
suggesting
that.
these
are
undivided
interests,
but
their
share
of
the
interest
was
four
and
a
half
acres,
and
if
you
look
at
the
history
of
indian
land
policy,
the
reason
that
these
people
had
undivided
interest
was
not
actually
their
doing,
but
actually
government
policy
which
set
up
the
allotment
scheme
and
then
determined
that
these
interests
would
pass
in
an
undivided
status.
so
the
fact
that
they
did
not,
could
not
go,
charles
pumpkin
seed
could
not
go
to
the
john
shot
allotment
and
say
this
four
and
a
half
acres
is
mine
and
i
have
trees
and
whatever.
he
still
had
an
interest
which
translates
into
four
and
a
half
acres
of
land,
which
is
a
significant
amount
of
land,
certainly
enough
land
to
put
a
house,
certainly
enough
land
to
put
a
garden,
and
to
characterize
these
interests
as
insignificant
and
de
minimis
is
not
correct
in
terms
of
the
indian
people
and
how
they
viewed
these
interests.
it
is
also
important
to
look
at
the
dollar
figures.
the
law
provides
that
if
you
have
not...
if
these
interests
had
not
earned
$100
within
the
year
preceding
death
then
these
interests
would
go
to
the
tribe.
again,
the
total...
it
is
true,
geraldine
cross
only
received
$135
in
the
year
preceding
death
for
all
of
her
26
interests,
but
the
factual
record
below
was
not
really
developed
in
terms
of
the
poverty
of
the
oglala
sioux
indian
reservation
or
the
clients
here,
but
i
think
the
court
could
take
judicial
notice
of
the
fact
that
bureau
of
census
figures
put
the
oglala
sioux
indian
reservation
as
one
of
the
poorest
counties...
shannon
county,
south
dakota,
is
one
of
the
poorest
counties
in
the
nation.
to
say
that
to
geraldine
cross
or
to
the
other
decedents
that
$135
did
not
increase
their
spending
power,
did
not
allow
them
to
buy
things
for
the
family,
and
is
insignificant
is
not
correct
when
you
look
at
the
interests
of
the
individuals
who
had
these
property
interests
taken.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
there
is.
in
the
joint
appendix,
beginning
at
page
18
of
the
joint
appendix
there
is
listed
the
inventory
for
each
of
the
four
decedents
here,
and
it
shows
the
dollar
value
of
these
property
interests
as
well
as
the
money
that
they
earned
in
the
year
preceding
and
then
the
land
description
and
so
forth.
and
so
there
are
dollar
figures
attached
in
terms
of
value
in
the
record.
the
two--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--okay,
that
would
have
been
charles
pumpkin
seed
on
page
34,
it
is
the
john
shot
allotment.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
oh,
i
am
sorry,
your
honor.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
okay.
it
is
on
page
38,
and
it
says
the
estimated
value
is
$266.66.
it
is
the
second
allotment
listed
on
page
38.
this
is
the
interest
that
is
1/72nd
of
320
acres,
which
is
approximately
four
and
a
half
acres
in
size.
it
is
the
size
of
the
interest
he
had,
undivided,
in
this
allotment,
and
it
is
valued
at
$266.66.
there
are
two
crucial
legal
questions
presented
here.
one
is
whether
there
are
vested
property
interests
here
which
are
protected
by
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
second
is
whether
or
not
these
property
interests
have
actually
been
taken
by
section
207
of
the
indian
land
consolidation
act.
the
court
of
appeals
correctly
found
that
the
decedents
here
had
vested
property
rights
and
that
they
included
the
right
to
pass,
and
the
court
of
appeals
based
its
holding
on
the
finding
of
this
court
in
choate
v.
trapp
in
1912
which
looked
at
the
fact
that
the
indian
people
receiving
allotments
were
required
to
give
valuable
consideration.
their
allotments
were
conditioned
upon
them
relinquishing
title
to
thousands
of
acres
of
land
which
they
formerly
had
held
in
common
as
tribal
lands.
the
only
way
that
the
individual
allottees
under
the
sioux
allotment
act
received
their
property
interests
was
if
they
relinquished
title.
they
gave
consideration
for
the
benefits
that
they
received
under
the
sioux
allotment
act.
the
court
of
appeals
also
correctly
found
that
included
in
the
rights
that
went
to
the
allottee
was
the
right
to
pass
this
property
upon
death
to
their
children
and
their
children's
children.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
i
think
looking
at
the
historical
record
the
decedents...
i
mean
the
allottees
were
in
the
process
of
gaining
their
approval
because
this
statute,
the
sioux
allotment
act
of
march
2nd,
1889,
only
went
into
effect
if
the
sioux
agreed
to
allotment.
if
you
look
at
the
commission--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--right,
though
talking
in
terms
of
the
sioux
people
and
what
they
understood
and
what
benefit
or
what
the
terms
of
the
bargain
should
be
with
the
federal
government
now,
it
is
clear
that
the
indian
people
understood
that
what
they
were
doing
was
protecting
a
land
base.
they
were
even
chided
by
the
commissioners
who
came
out
that
if
they
did
not
approve
this
statute
that
they
were
not
thinking
about
their
family,
they
were
not
thinking
about
their
children,
but
the
indian
people
did
not
understand
maybe
the
technical
distinctions
between
being
able
to
make
a
will
and
provide
for
inheritance
or
being
able
to
simply
pass
this
property
upon
death.
i
think
it
is
an
invalid
technicality
that
the
sioux
people
did
not
understand
in
1889
and
shouldn't
be
held
to
here
now.
there
also
is
some--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--what
i
am
saying--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--is
basically
not
the
1889
treaty,
but
the
1889
statute--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--in
terms
of
relying
on
the
holding
of
choate
v.
trapp,
which
was
a
similar
situation
in
which
the
indians
were
allotted,
and
it
is
true
that
in
the
case
of
choate
v.
wright
what
was
before
the
court
was
a
tax
exemption
for
a
period
of
25
years
which
was
only
to
the
allottee,
but
it
is
our
submission
that
the
same
principles
apply
here
where
you
have
individual
indians
who,
to
acquire
this
allotment,
gave
consideration.
that
was
what
the
eighth
circuit
said.
there
was
valuable
consideration
given
here.
that
is
what
this
court
said
in
choate.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
no.
that
they
intended
for
these
interests--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--to
escheat
and
not
to
go
to
either
the
heirs
or
devisees
of--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--my
claim
is
a
constitutional
one.
my
claim
is
also
one
that
is
tied
to
the
sioux
allotment
procedure.
i
don't
believe
that
congress
when
they
enacted
this
statute
necessarily
had
before
it
the
historical
circumstances
and
the
bargaining
that
went
on.
as
counsel
for
the
justice
has
indicated,
the
sioux
received
for
heads
of
household
twice
the
amount
of
property
that
other
people
did
in
terms
of
the
general
allotment
act.
that
was
because
there
was
a
statute
passed
the
year
before
in
which
they
could
not
get
the
approval
of
the
sioux
people.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
right.
in
terms
of
the
rights,
though,
if
it
effects
a
taking,
then
there
has
to
be
compensation
for
the
interests--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--and
it
is
our
position
here
today
that
the
interests
here
taken
should
be
compensated.
we
do
not
dispute
the
fact
that
the
federal
government
has
the
authority
to
enact
legislation
such
as
this,
but
what
we
do
contest
is
that
they
are
able
to
take
these
property
interests
without
any
compensation
to
the
individual
indians.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
we
are
asking
that
this
be
recognized
as
a
fifth
amendment
taking
which
would
hold
this
provision
unconstitutional
and
that
if
congress
attempted
this
type
of
legislation
again,
that
it
would
take
from--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--we--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--that's
correct.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
but
we
feel
that
in
terms
of
the
standing
analysis,
that
in
looking
at
the
decisions
of
this
court
there
is
a
two-pronged
test.
one
is
the
ability
of
the
person's
constitutional
rights
to
be
brought
to
the
court
itself.
in
this
particular
case--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--to
the
decedents'
estates,
and
then
based
upon
the
procedure
that
is
in
place
through
the
bureau
of
indian
affairs,
the
estate,
that
will
be
another
element
of
the
estate,
just
as
these
particular--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--no,
to
be
distributed
under
the
terms
of
either
the
will,
as
geraldine
cross
had,
or
under
the
intestate
succession
scheme
which
is
the
laws
of
the
state
of
south
dakota
for
sioux
indians.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
that's
correct,
but
if
you
get
compensation
then
the
court
is
recognizing
that
the
statute
as
it
was
originally
enacted
was
unconstitutional
because
it
took
an
interest
without
paying
compensation.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
right,
but
the
tribe--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--right.
it
would
go
to
the
estates,
and
then
the
heirs
or
devisees--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--would
escheat--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--right.
that's
correct.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
and
that
is
one
of--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--right,
and
that
is
one
of
the...
i
mean,
obviously
one
of
the
goals
of
this
legislation
was
to
reduce
a
fractionated
heirship
problem
which
does
exist
on
indian
lands
today.
but
to
do
ti
at
the
expense
of
individual
indians
and
making
them
bear
the
cost
of
undoing
federal
indian
land
policy
which
has
resulted
in
the
fractionated
heirship
problem
is
to
unfairly
place
the
burden
and
not
to
fairly
distribute
the
benefits
and
burdens
on
the
indian
reservation.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
one
of
the
problems
of
selling
interests
is,
as
we
have
discussed,
is
that
these
are
undivided
interests.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
and
it
is
difficult
to
interest
probably
anyone
but
other
people
holding
interests
in
the
allotment
or
the
tribe.
now,
the
amicus
brief
for
the
yakima
nation
has
explained
that
their
tribe
has
developed
a
fund
system
so
that
they
are
purchasing
these
types
of
interests.
the
other
tribes
have
had
to
rely
on
a
farmers
home
administration
loan
program
where
the
tribes
get
loans
and
then
purchase.
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
here
because
this
case
went
through
the
district
court
on
a
request
for
preliminary
relief
which
was
consolidated
on
a
permanent
relief,
and
there
is
not
really
a
factual
record
here
in
terms
of
what
happened
with
these
individuals,
but
i
think
the
court
can
note
that
with
undivided
interests
on
the
middle
of
an
indian
reservation
in
trust
status
that
this
is
not
the
normal
type
of
property
that
would
have
been
easy
to
sell.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
certainly
they
could
be
sold,
but
the
question
would
be
where
the
buyer
would
come
from.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
right.
certainly
the
tribe
is
the
most
logical
buyer
of
those
types
of
interests,
and
it
depends
upon
whether
the
tribes
have
the
funds
to
do
it.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
the
oglala
sioux
tribe
filed
an
amicus
brief
in
the
eighth
circuit,
and
they
did
not
participate
at
this
level.
their--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--they
were...
i
don't
think
that
they
are
against
getting
the
property,
but
they
are
against
this
matter,
the
way
that
this
statute
does
it
because
they
view
it
as
inherently
unfair
in
terms
of
taking
property
from
individual
indians
without
any
compensation.
clearly,
and
it
has
not
been
disputed
here,
indian
individual
property
has
the
same
protections
under
the
fifth
amendment.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
there
is
a
statute
which
requires
the
secretary
of
interior
and
regulations
which
require
the
secretary
of
interior
to
approve
transfers
of
the
tribe...
of
tribal
property,
so
you
would
get
back
to
the--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--but
the
tribe
and
what
they
would
propose
to
do
and
indicated
at
the
eight
circuit
was
to
basically
give
these
people
their
property
back
so
that
they
would
not
be
consolidating,
and
i
doubt
seriously
that
they
would
have
gotten
the
approval
of
the
secretary
of
interior
to
transfer
back
to
exactly
where
they
were--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--ahead
of
time.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
excuse
me,
your
honor?
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
uh-huh.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
before
death
what
did
these
individuals
do?
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
they
basically
held
them
as
undivided
interests
and
got
lease
income
each
month...
each
year
from
them.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
there
are...
the
government
has
repeatedly
indicated
in
terms
of
the
named
decedents
here
that
they
had
the
opportunity
to
sell,
they
had
the
opportunity
to
partition
their
land,
they
had
the
opportunity
to
do
gift
conveyances.
it
is
important
to
realize
they
couldn't
have
done
any
of
that
without
going
through
bia
procedures
in
terms
of
doing
that
and
getting
approval
of
the
superintendent
or
the
secretary
to
do
it.
it
is
also
important
to
note
factually
here
that
this
statute
was
passed
january
12th,
1983.
the
memorandum
which
went
out
to
the
agencies
telling
them
that
this
act
has
to
be
implemented
was
not
received
in
the
pine
ridge
agency
until
march
7th.
chester
irving
died
on
march
18th.
ans
so
i
think
that
it
is
highly
unlikely
that...
while
we
have
no
factual
record
here
to
indicate
otherwise,
i
would
submit
that
it
is
highly
unlikely
that
chester
irving
has
any
notice
in
terms
of
the
acquiesced
to
the
goals
of
the
indian
land
consolidation
act
and
the
idea
that
his
tribe
was--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--this
was
initially...
the
plaintiffs
did
not.
this
was
filed...
people
came
into
our
pine
ridge
legal
services
office
and
they
had
a
hearing--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--that
is
correct,
and
the
reason
that
we
have
brought
this
factual
record
to
your
attention
is
to
counter
the
fact
that
the
government
has
repeatedly
said
that
this
statute
offers
a
lot
of...
given
the
circumstances
here
there
were
a
lot
of
other
remedies
that
people
had
and
they
could
have--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--i
don't.
we
have
not
established
the
record
for
that
and
we
have
not
raised
it
below.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
i
would
think
that
we
view
this
situation
as
completely
unique
in
terms
of
the
contract
and
the
consideration
that
was
given
here.
this
was
more
than...
for
their
360
acres...
i
mean,
320
acres
or
180
acres,
whatever
they
received,
they
relinquished
title
to
millions
of
land,
millions
of
acres
of
land.
i
would
say
that
the
situation
here,
the
actual
bargaining
that
went
on,
the
unique
situation
of
the
indian
people
in
terms
of
the
federal
government,
makes
this
a
contractual
type,
bargain
type
relationship
which
is
unique
to
anything
in
terms
of
everyday
property
law,
and
that
the
court
should...
you
know,
that
the
fifth
amendment
taking
is
narrowed
here
to
the
circumstances
of
the
sioux
allotment
act.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
justice
stevens,
that
particular
case
is
different
in
that
it
does
not
deal
with
a
devise
situation.
in
other
words,
it
did
not
deal
with
someone
who
dies
and
what
notice
is
to
be
given
in
terms
of
heirs
protecting
interests.
but
certainly
in
texaco
versus
short,
this
court
said
that
it
was
all
right,
you
know,
to
condition
property
rights
and
to
require
that
they
file
these
notices,
and
to
fail
to
do
that
was
basically
that
these
people
had
abandoned
their
interests
in
the
mining
claims
that
they
had.
the
point
here
is
that
we
don't
have
a
factual
situation
where
we
could
say
that
these
people
abandoned,
the
decedents
abandoned,
any
interest
or
right
that
they
had
in
terms
of
this
property.
they
in
all
likelihood
had
no
notice
and
had
no
opportunity.
even
geraldine
cross,
who
made
a
will
march
26th,
before...
or
i
think
it
was
maybe
march--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--that's
correct.
but
there
was
also
a
two-year
period
in
which
they
had
to
file
a
claim
to
preserve
those
interests.
and
as
i
read
the
case,
the
court
said
that,
because
the
owners
had
basically
abandoned
their
interest
and
had
not
filed
the
claims
as
they
were
required
to
do,
but
they
did
have
a
two-year
grace
period
in
which
they
were
able
to
take
steps,
affirmative
steps
to
protect
their
property.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
there
was
no
meaningful
time
period
for
those
particular
decedents,
i
would
argue,
because
of
the
time
period
between
the
time
that
the
statute
was
passed
and
the
time
of
their
death.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
well,
in
texaco
i
feel
that,
you
know,
there
was
a
provision
for
a
grace
period,
and
there
was
none
here
in
terms
of
people
affirmatively
protecting
their
rights.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
certainly
that's
a
factor
that
has
to
be
balanced
in
determining
the
situation.
to
argue
that
these
people
had
other
remedies
i
don't
think
is
correct,
but
in
terms
of
the
situation
at
large,
we
still
argue
that
there
are
protected
interests
here
which
should
have
been,
even
if
people
had
notice...
for
instance,
geraldine
cross,
she
made
a
will,
and
under
the
indian
land
consolidation
act
as
originally
enacted
her
will
was
given
no
effect.
that
would
still
be
the
case
today
because
she
would
not
have
been
able
to
pass
her
interest
to
her
children,
her
minor
children
who
she
wanted
to
protect
and
try
and
provide
for,
because
you
have
to...
under
the
amendments,
if
you
devise
your
property,
the
property
interest
must
go
to
someone
else
who
holds
an
interest
in
that
allotment.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
i
would
say
that
the
notice
provision
is
important
only
in
response
to
the
government
saying
that
people
could
have...
in
their
reply
brief
they
seem
to
say
that
our
people
acquiesced,
the
decedents
acquiesced
in
what
happened.
i
don't
feel
that
is
appropriate
under
the
facts
here.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
that's
correct.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
i
think
they
are
responding
to
my
factual
statement
which
i
put
forward
in
our
brief
that
the
circumstances
here
would
prevent...
would
have
in
all
likelihood
prevented
these
people
from
availing
themselves
of
the
remedies
that
the
government
has
always
said
individuals
had
under
this
to
avoid
the
effects
of
the
statute.
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
that's
correct.
i
mean,
if
the
term
was
set
up
that
they
were
going
to
affirmatively
say,
if
you
don't
do
something
your
property
interest
is
going
to
be
abandoned,
then
we
really
do
have
a
due
process
type
of
was
there
sufficient
notice,
and
then
again
you
would
still,
i
think,
in
terms
of
the
unique
situation
of
the
sioux
here,
get
into
whether
or
not
these
property
interests
could
have
even
been
taken
under
that
scheme
because
there
was
valuable
consideration
given
for
the
interest,
because,
you
know,
these
other
property
interests
were
relinquished,
the
indians
understood
they
were
going
to
have--
ms.
yvette
hall
war
bonnett
--in
terms
of
how
they
paid
for
it
or
what
they
relinquished,
i
think
that
this
case
presents
distinguishable
facts
from
someone
who
goes
to
the
state
of
new
york
and
pays
the
appraised
value
for
a
piece
of
property,
but
i
will
leave
that
decision
up
to
the
court.
the
government
in
their
briefs
has
indicated
that
this
is
just
a
regulatory
taking.
we
disagree
completely
with
that.
the
whole
purpose
and
the
whole
effect
of
section
207
is
to
transfer
ownership
of
property,
it
is
to
take
the
title
of
the
property
from
charles
pumpkin
seed
and
permanently
give
it
to
the
oglala
sioux
tribe.
we...
as
i
previously
stated,
indian
people
have
the
same
protection
for
their
individual
property
as
non-indians
do,
and
that
protection
is
the
fifth
amendment,
and
the
facts
here,
the
fact
that
the
interests
here
are
small
or
what
the
government
terms
de
minimis
is
not
relevant
to
the
fact
that
if
a
property
interest
has
been
taken
then
compensation
must
be
made.
it
is
also
not
relevant
that
the
interest
here
is
going
to
the
tribes
rather
than
to
the
federal
government,
because
you
still
have
individual
indians
who
are
being
asked
to
pay
with
their
own
property
interest
to
effect
a
greater
good,
to
consolidate
indian
land.
and
it
is
also
significant
here
that
these
individuals
are
being
asked
to
correct
a
failed
federal
government
policy
with
no
expense
to
the
government
but
only
to
the
individual
indians.
if
there
are
no
further
questions,
thank
you.
