justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
may
i
follow
up
on
the
question
asked
by
justice
o'connor?
on
page
17
of
your
opening
brief,
page
17,
i
think-it
is
the
third
sentence
in
the
second
paragraph,
the
brief
states,
"every
sovereign
possesses
the
power
to
regulate
the
manner
and
terms
upon
which
property
may
be
transmitted
at
death
as
well
as
the
authority
to
prescribe
who
shall
and
who
shall
not
be
capable
of
taking
it.
"
doesn't
that
say
that
the
government
may
disinherit
anyone
it
wishes
to
disinherit?
you
do
cite
berwin
trust
against
day,
which
seems
on
its
face
to
go
rather
far,
but
i
am
surprised
that
the
solicitor
general
would--
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
--you
didn't
intend
for
it
to
be
taken
the
way
it
reads?

ms.
war
bonnett,
may
i
ask,
prior
to
this
act,
i
think
it's
agreed
that
the
heirs
had
the
right
to
sell
these
fractional
interest.
does
the
record
show
whether
in
fact
there
was
any
selling
of
the
interest
actually
occurring?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes.
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
so
there
is
nothing
in
the
record
that
tells
us
whether
in
fact
these
interests
could
be
sold?
justice
lewis
f.
powell,
jr.
yes,
in
theory,
but
economically
i
suppose
the
record
is
simply
silent
with
respect
to
whether
or
not
they
could
in
fact
be
sold
as
you
find
buyers
who
were
willing
to
buy
fractional
interests.
