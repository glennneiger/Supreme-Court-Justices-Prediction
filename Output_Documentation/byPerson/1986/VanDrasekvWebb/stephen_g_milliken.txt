mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
the
question
presented
in
this
case
is
whether
military
personnel
should
be
denied
judicial
review
when
seeking
only
equitable
relief
for
constitutional,
statutory,
or
regulatory
violations
committed
by
their
superior
officers.
the
question
is
whether
federal
courts
will
ensure
that
military
services
will
comply
with
the
commands
of
the
constitution,
of
acts
of
congress,
and
of
their
own
regulations.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
we
contend
that
the
district
court
more
or
less
commented
on
the
issue,
but
did
not,
in
the
context
of
this
whistle-blower
case,
give
significant
protection
to
the
speech
engaged
in
by
captain
van
drasek,
and
did
not
employ
the
independent
scrutiny
of
the
entire
record
requiring...
required
in
first
amendment
cases,
as
this
court
said
in
bose
v.
consumers
union--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--mr.
chief
justice,
the
district
court
failed
not
only
to
apply
a
proper
first
amendment
scrutiny
to
the
whistle-blower
aspect
of
the
case;
the
district
court
failed
to
review
at
all
the
substantive
elements
of
the
article
138
complaint
brought
by
captain
van
drasek,
and
failed
to
acknowledge
that
the
district
court
did
have
the
power
to
review
under
the
administrative
procedures
act.
thus,
it
is
our
contention
that
indeed
captain
van
drasek
was
denied
review
of
the
entire
record,
by
the
district
court's
refusal
to
review
the
138
record,
to
review
the
allegations
of
command
influence,
and
the
failures
of
investigations
upon
those
complaints.
the
district
court,
indeed,
denied
captain
van
drasek
jurisdiction
over
a
core
element
of
his
claim,
and
thus,
as
the
bcnr
has
done,
the
board
for
correction
of
naval
records,
did
not
perform
the
independent
review
required
where
there
are
matters
of
protected
speech
addressing
matters
of
public
concern
that
have
been
raised
by
a
service
member
which
result
in
that
service
member
losing
the
military
career
to
which
he
has
devoted
his
life.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
this
case
is
not
moot
because,
john
van
drasek,
although
he
is
medically
disably
retired,
serves
in
his
retirement
as
a
captain,
at
the
rank
of
captain.
the
relief
we
seek
is
a
return
to
the
board
for
correction
of
naval
records
with
instruction
that
that
body
undertake
the
review
of
the
article
138
investigation;
and
that
the
federal
court
remain
open
to
protect
the
first
and
fifth
amendment
claims
arising
on
this
record;
and
that
then
john
van
drasek
would
be
entitled,
following
that
review,
to
be
put
before
new
promotion
boards
with
deletion
of
the
retaliatory
material,
in
order
that
he
could
be
properly
considered
for
promotion
to
major.
and
thus
the
claim
is
not
moot.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
the
first
promotion
passover
occurred
in
april
of
1982,
and
that
promotion
consideration
occurred
immediately
following
what
it
has
been
uncontested
was
a
killer
fitness
report,
an
all-grade-b
fitness
report
given
to
john
van
drasek
by
his
commanding
colonel,
colonel
cooper.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
that
is
absolutely
correct.
the
second
promotion
passover
which
occurred
by
a
board
sitting
in
may
of
1983,
did
of
course
follow
all
of
the
events
raised
in
the
138
complaint
by
captain
van
drasek.
and
thus,
the
second
promotion
passover,
which
would
trigger
under
the
up-or-out
rule,
his
separation
from
the
corps,
needed
to
take
cognizance
of
all
of
the
circumstances
arising
prior
to
the
date
of
that
second
promotion
report.
it
is
further
significant
that
indeed--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--we
would
submit
that,
yes,
the
fact
that
captain
van
drasek
is
retired
from
the
marine
corps
resulted
from
his
medical
disability
discharge.
the
medical
disability
discharge
processing
occurred
following
a
may
23rd
letter
mailed
by
captain
van
drasek's
original
civilian
counsel,
mr.
steinberg,
to
the
services.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
in
may
of
'83.
within
three
weeks
of
that
letter
being
sent,
at
a
time
when
it
was
requested
that
the
article
138
proceedings
be
reviewed,
within
three
weeks,
on
june
14th,
1983,
captain
van
drasek
was
ordered
to
submit
to
a
medical
fitness
board.
and
there
is
in
the
record
the
comment
that
he
was
sent
there
by
his
commanding
general
because
of--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--there
was
no
question.
and
i
only
raise
the
matter
of
the
orders
for
captain
van
drasek
to
report
to
the
medical
fitness
board
as
they
came
so
closely
on
the
retention
of
civilian
counsel,
as
a
further
retaliatory
event.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
no,
that
is
correct,
mr.
justice
stevens.
and
i
would
suggest
that
there
are
four
very
clear
events
which
occurred
starting
in
october,
1981,
when
john
van
drasek
first
addressed
the
question
of
the
denial
of
equal
employment
opportunity
to
pregnant
marines
to
his
commanding
colonel,
and
the
immediate
following
of
the
killer
fitness
report.
and
it
has
been
uncontested
that
the
bright
line
all-excellent
fitness
report
was
a
killer
report.
no
outstanding
marks
for
the
first
time.
it
was
aberrant
in
relationship
to
john
van
drasek's
career.
that
event
was
followed
by
john
van
drasek
having
failed
in
the
personal
face-to-face
meeting
with
his
commander
to
effect
the
equal
employment
opportunity
for
pregnant
marines,
in
drafting
a
proposed
order
for
the
marine
corps
development
and
education
command
which
would
permit...
and
this
was
done
after
he
had
consulted
with
ob/gyn
experts
to
ensure
that
there
was
no
medical
danger
to
pregnant
marines
proceeding
with
the
training
at
the
noncommissioned
officers
leadership
school.
and
immediately
after
the
proposal
of
that
order,
john
van
drasek
received
the
second
fitness
report,
with
a
predominance
of
excellent
marks.
but
more
significantly,
within
one
month,
he
was
demoted
from
the
director
of
the
noncommissioned
officers
leadership
school,
to
a
position
as
an
academics
officer;
from
principal
of
the
school
to
a
teacher.
and
thereupon
followed
his
assignment
to
the
administrative
discharge
board
by
his
commanding
general.
general
toomey.
when
he
voted
in
the
third
incident,
with
the
unanimous
board,
to
retain
a
marine,
despite
an
alleged
drug
abuse
problem,
he
was
removed
from
the
next
administrative
discharge
board
by
his
commanding
colonel,
colonel
cooper,
and
that
is
in
direct
violation
of
the
orders
from
the
commanding
general,
general
toomey,
who
had
placed
him
in
that
position.
there
was
no
power
within
colonel
cooper
to
remove
captain
van
drasek
from
that
administrative
discharge
board.
when
he
voted,
in
the
fourth
incident,
for
an
honorable
discharge
to
a
marine
north,
the
very
same
day
as
that
vote
occurred,
he
was
transferred
out
of
that
command
entirely.
he
was
returned,
after
a
face-to-face
with
his
commanding
colonel
cooper.
then
he
broke
his
leg
parachuting,
and
he
was
transferred,
again
demoted,
to
the
position
of
publications
processor.
thus
the
incidents,
we
would
submit
the
district
court
was
wrong
in
just
pointing
to
the
two
fitness
reports
as
giving
rise
to
the
demotion
of
captain
van
drasek.
because
on
the
fitness
report
brief,
may
it
please
the
court,
the
fitness
report
the
promotion
boards
who
consider
captains
rising
to
the
rank
of
major,
see
the
marks
they
receive;
but
they
also
see
their
duty
assignments
and
their
grades.
and
thus,
from
the
time
john
van
drasek
sat
on
that
administrative
discharge
board,
his
career...
and
all
he
did
was
vote
his
conscience;
we're
talking
about
a
situation
where
an
executive
officer
who
institutes
charges,
if
displeased
by
what
a
court
does,
then
summarily
abuses
or
removes
or
takes
unlawful
action
against
a
court,
this
is
a
corruption
of
a
tribunal
by
command
influence.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
yes.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
yes,
your
honor,
in
this
context,
and
not
only
under--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--the
issue
under
which
that
review
arises
is
the
first
and
fifth
amendment
claims,
the
whistle-blower
claims,
which--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--independent
of
the
retaliatory
action
against
captain
van
drasek,
there
is
jurisdiction
to
review
the
138
investigation
under
the
administrative
procedures
act.
there
is
also
jurisdiction
to
review
the
article
138
investigation
under
the
fifth
amendment,
where
the
military
failed
to
follow
its
own
regulations
in
conducting
the
138
investigation.
thus--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--absolutely
not,
justice
marshall.
this
court
has
delineated
very
bright
lines
as
to
when
the
courts
may
interfere,
or
may
command
the
military
to
obey
either
a
statute
or
a
constitutional
provision.
in
feres
and
in
chappell,
the
question
of
damages
was
found
to
be
inappropriate
as
it
might
threaten
order
and
discipline
in
the
military.
but
this
court
has
never
held,
and
indeed,
the
respondents
concede
at
page
44
of
their
brief,
that
the
federal
courts
remain
open,
indeed,
to
directly
review
constitutional
claims,
and
the
decisions
in
goldman,
frontlero,
parker,
schlesinger,
huff,
and
in
numerable
cases,
this
court
has
said
the
federal
courts
remain
open
to
ensure
not
only
that
the
military
obeys
the
constitution,
but
that
they
follow
their
own
regulations
in
carrying
out
their
military
responsibilities.
in
this
case
there
is
no
request
by
captain
john
van
drasek,
as
he
is
now
retired,
to
have
this
court
or
any
federal
court
do
other
than
vindicate
constitutional
precepts
and
military
regulations.
he
did
not
suggest
any
method
or
any
way
in
which
a
military
superior
should
conduct
the
properly
and
purely
military
activities
within
the
command;
he
only
spoke
in
favor
of
upholding
the
law
of
equal
employment
opportunity
and
in
favor
of
having
corruption
free
tribunals.
and
in
that
regard,
those
matters
are
properly
of
public
concern.
and
indeed,
they
should
be
especially
protected
matters
of
speech
because
john
van
drasek
would
have
been
in
violation
of
the
law
had
he
not
spoken
up.
and
it
is
our
contention
that
having
spoken
up,
as
the
law
required
him,
to
suppress
dissolute
and
immoral
activities
in
the
corps
that
he
perceived--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--this
court
in
chappell...
that
is
correct.
this
court
in
chappell
v.
wallace
said
that
there
were
intra-service
remedies
available
to
aggrieved
service
members,
and
that
article
138
and
bcnr,
too--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--justice
stevens,
they
are
separate--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--the
bcnr
decision
did.
and
it
also
found
that
it
did
not
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
article
138
proceedings.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
in
both
forms.
certainly,
bcnr,
by
grant
of
congress,
10
u.s.
code
section
15-52(a)
said
the
boards
for
correction
of
military
records
are
empowered
to
correct
any
military
record
to
remove
an
injustice.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
justice
stevens,
i
would
say
no,
only
because
it
was
not
the
grade
b
marks
on
the
fitness
report
alone
which
led
to
the
promotion
passover.
john
van
drasek
came--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--and
indeed,
the
board
for
correction
of
naval
records
held,
and
this
is
on
page
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
that
the
evidence
of
record...
that
there
is
substantial
additional
evidence
of
record
raising
questions
about
the
judgment
and
fairness
of
the
co-ocs,
that's
colonel
cooper.
and
in
that
connection
the
board
finds
the
evidence
sufficient
to
establish
that
the
co-ocs
may
well
have
allowed
petitioner's
voting
on
the
administrative
discharge
board
to
influence
his
decision
to
seek
petitioner's
transfer.
thus
in
the
greater
review--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--they
said
that
because
the
fitness
report,
the
original
fitness
report
prepared
by
colonel
cooper
had
excellent
marks,
that
it
was
an
excellent
fitness
report.
it
has
been
uncontested
in
the
record
of
evidence
before
that
board
that
an
all-excellent
bright
line
fitness
report,
where
this
individual
had
never
previously
failed
to
have
outstanding
marks
contained
within
his
fitness--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--page
19
of
the
joint
appendix,
justice
scalia,
beginning
on
the
second
line
with
"the
board
notes
that
the
evidence.
"
and
continuing
down
to
the
word
nevertheless.
and
i
would
suggest
that
it
is
the
presentation
of
this
substantial
evidence
of
record
that
there
was
a
causal
connection
between
the
retaliatory
action
and
this
officer
speaking
out
that
gives
rise
to
the
first
amendment
standards
of
review
that
apply
to
a
whistle-blower
case,
just
as
in
connick
v.
myers,
in
pickering,
in
mt.
healthy
v.
doyle.
and
indeed,
in
mt.
healthy
v.
doyle,
that
once
that
evidence
is
adduced--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--they
are
one.
and
the
independent
review
required
of
a
federal
court
must
embrace
all
of
the
cause
and
effect,
the
action-reaction
events,
which
lead
to
the
separation
of
the
employee,
as
certainly
his
demotion
from
director
of
the
noncommissioned
officers
leadership
school
down
to
a
paper
processor,
publications
officer,
was
such
a
marked
reversal
of
an
otherwise
outstanding
career.
and
all
of
those
demotions--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--justice
stevens,
there
is
absolutely
no
question.
and
with
regard
to
those
fitness
reports,
it
is
our
contention
that
they
were
in
retaliation
for
john
van
drasek
having
spoken
up
and
complained
that
pregnant
marines
were
not
getting
equal
employment
opportunities.
so
there
are
two
matters
which
john
van
drasek
addresses,
both
of
them
matters
of
public
concern:
eeo
violations,
and
command
influence,
that
most
pernicious
element
which
principally
gave
rise
to
the
promulgation
of
the
united
states...
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice.
and
i
would
suggest
that
in
retaliation
for
speaking
up
on
behalf
of
pregnant
marines,
john
van
drasek
received
retaliatory
negative
fitness
reports,
a
killer
fitness
report
which
led
to
his
first
promotion
passover.
but
in
the
ensuing
months,
in
the
ensuing
year
between
that
first
promotion
passover
and
the
second
promotion
passover,
that
colonel
copper,
in
displeasure
at
john
van
drasek's
having
done
no
more
than
any
judge
should
do,
and
that
is,
vote
his
conscience
and
pursue
his
obligations
as
a
member
of
a
court,
a
board,
as
he
was
ordered
to
do
by
his
commanding
general,
then
finds
himself
demoted
from
the
director
of
the
school
down
to
a
position
pushing
papers;
demoted
first
to
teacher,
then
to
publications
processor.
in
that
circumstance,
we
would
submit
that
the
court,
the
reviewing
bcnr
and
then
the
reviewing
federal
court,
should
undertake
the
first
and
fifth
amendment
review
required
in
a
whistle-blower
case
to
look
at
the
entire
record
of
events,
all
of
the
lawful
actions
taken
by
john
van
drasek,
everyone
of
them
required
of
him
by
law,
and
all
of
the
unlawful
retaliatory
actions
undertaken
against
him,
both
in
connection
with
the
eeo
giving
rise
to
the
retaliatory
fitness
reports,
and
in
regard
to
the
complaints
about
command
influence
giving
rise
to
his
removal,
transfer
and
demotions.
in
that
respect,
we
would
submit
that
under
mt.
healthy
v.
doyle,
that
there
is
a
shift
in
the
burden.
and
at
that
point...
and
in
that
case
mr.
chief
justice
rehnquist
wrote
that
the
burden
shifts
to
the
employer
to
show
that
but
for
the
matters
of
protected
speech,
and
any
action
taken
as
a
result
thereof,
that
that
individual
would
have
been
separated
anyway.
there
is
no
evidence
in
this
record
that
any
of
the
disabling-events
in
captain
van
drasek's
career
arose
out
of
anything
but
retaliation
for
his
lawful
activities.
thus,
you
have
a
situation
where
someone
speaks
out
to
support
the
law,
and
their
career
ends.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
mr.
chief
justice,
there
is
not
the
same
test
of
review,
but
it
is
similar.
and
a
combination
of
those
cases
and
the
military
cases
that
have
been
decided
by
this
court
reveals
their
similarity,
and
reveals
the
adjustment
necessary
to
protect
the
independence,
the
deference
which
the
civilian
world
must
show
to
the
military
to
preserve
order
and
discipline.
in
the
case
of
a
whistle-blower
case
arising
in
a
government
agency,
there
is
a
balancing
which
has
been
written
to
require
an
evaluation
of
the
degree
of
speech,
the
protection
to
be
accorded
it,
and
the
degree
of
intrusion
in
the
service
which
the
agency
is
providing.
in
the
military's
case,
it
would
be
appropriate
in
that
balancing
to
ensure
that
the
judges,
to
quote
from
orloff
v.
willoughby,
are
not
given
the
task
of
running
the
army.
there
can
be
no
determination
by
a
court
as
to
how
properly
a
weapon
is
to
be
handled,
or
other
particularly
military
determinations.
however,
here
we're
talking
about
equal
employment
opportunity.
we're
talking
about
command
influence,
corruption
of
a
court.
who
better
than
a
court
to
decide
that
a
court
should
not
be
corrupted
by
the
executive--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--the
difference
in
the
standard
of
review
is
that
where
there
is
a
determination
made
that
interference
in
a
purely
military
determination
will
hinder
the
orderly
functioning
of
the
military
services
and
its
combat
readiness,
that
the
court
shouldn't
interfere.
but
where
there
are
constitutional,
statutory
and
regulatory
violations,
and
all
the
court
is
asked
to
do
is
to
have
the
military
obey
the
law--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--mr.
chief
justice,
in
the
case
of
parker
v.
levy,
this
court
undertook
to
determine
the
constitutional
vagueness
of
statutes
in
the
military,
and
determined
that
the
peculiarly
important
element
of
a
military
officer
following
the
requirements
of
his
service
required
that
the
court
not
determine
that
a
statute
was
unconstitutionally
vague,
even
if
it
might
have
been
so
determined
in
a
civilian
forum.
that's
the
best
example
i
can
think
of
where
a
court
can
separate
the
requirements
of
a
military
officer
from
the
normal
lawful
requirements
that
the
military
obey
its
own
laws
and
the
laws
of
the
united
states.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
the
court
may
be
right.
and
this
court's
decision--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--i
cannot
disagree
with
that
proposition.
and
certainly--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--there
is
a
difference,
and
certainly
this
court
has
held
that
the
approval,
prior
approval
by
commanders
of
circulating
petitions
to
congress,
and
that
the
ability
to
say,
for
example,
as
was
said
in
the
parker
case
by
this
doctor,
to
all
black
officers,
you
should
not
go
and
serve
in
vietnam
because
it's
a
racist
war,
that
that
was
found
to
be
properly
subject
to
court
martial
proceedings
and
the
statute
not
unconstitutionally
vague,
because
you
cannot
have
an
individual
counselling
individuals
who
are
involved
in
the
service
against
going
to
war;
that
the
military
can
determine
what
wars
to
fight
and
how
to
fight
them,
and
you
can't
have
somebody
expressing
dissidence
which
undermines
that
authority.
nothing
in
what
john
van
drasek
said
or
did
during
the
course
of
his
career
addressed
a
policy
determination
or
an
executive
function
of
the
military.
all
he
spoke
to
was
the
following
of
the
navy
regulations
and
the
marine
corps
eeo
manual
in
regard
to
allowing
pregnant
marines
to
attend
the
school
he
was
made
director
of.
and
all
he
spoke
about
in
concern
over
the
tribunals
was
that
the
commander
cannot
dissuade
subordinates
from
testifying
in
trials,
that
the
commander
cannot
tell
reviewing
courts
that
they
are
to
accept,
without
fact
finding,
specific
pieces
of
evidence.
thus,
where
you
have
the
bright
line
separation
between
a
prohibition
against
damages
action,
there
is
no
prohibition...
and
this
court
has
never
held,
and
should
not
now
hold...
that
equitable
relief
is
unavailable
to
a
member
of
the
military
service
in
the
civilian
courts.
additionally,
where
as
in
gilligan--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--yes,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
certainly,
not,
and
this
court
held--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--courts
martial
have
review
independent
of
the
military
through
the
court
of
military
appeals,
which
was
specially
created
so
that
there
would
be
a
civilian
review
of
criminal
prosecutions,
criminal
determinations
made
within
the
military
services.
and
in
regard
to--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--military
commissions
have
been
determined
by
this
court,
and
by
all
the
commentators
that
i
have
been
able
to
find,
to
be
exclusively
the
war
courts.
in
that
case
of
madsen
v.
kinsella,
the
determination
was
so
made,
and
that
was
a
military
commission
in
germany.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
that's
correct.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
the
administrative...
justice
scalia,
the
administrative
procedures
act
was
enacted
in
1947.
the
uniform
code
of
military
justice,
which
embraces
10
u.s.
code
938,
the
complaint
of
wrongs
enabling
provision
in
this
case,
was
promulgated
in
1951.
congress
knew,
by
sending
to
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
that
the...
of
all
article
138
complaints
for
final
review
by
the
secretary
of
the
navy,
that
it
would
come
within
the
administrative
procedures
act,
or
it
would
have
made
it
specifically
unreviewable,
as
it
did
in
the
case
of--
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
--thank
you,
justice
scalia.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
my
point
is
simply
that
congress
knew
exactly
what
it
was
doing
in
those
two
statutes,
and
specifically
excluded
review.
and
the
very
specific
exclusion
of
review,
under
this
court's
determination
in
lindahl,
includes
in
those
matters
not
specifically
left
out.
and
this
court
would
have
to
legislate
if
it
were
to
exclude
that
matter.
i
would
ask
to
reserve
what
little
time
i
have
left
for
rebuttal.
mr.
stephen
g.
milliken
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
captain
van
drasek
has
had
his
claim
parsed
by
the
bcnr,
by
the
district
court,
by
the
officer
of
the
solicitor
general.
and
what
he
seeks
is
merely
to
have
his
first
and
fifth
amendment
claims
reviewed
on
one
whole
factual
record,
in
one
court,
at
one
time.
whether
this
court
would
grant
relief
by
returning
john
van
drasek
to
the
board
for
correction
of
naval
records,
with
instructions
that
the
board
for
correction
of
naval
records
is
empowered
to
review
the
elements
of
the
138
investigation
which
pertain
to
his
separation
from
the
marines,
or
whether
that
power
lies
in
the
district
court,
it
is
the
petitioner's
contention
that
to
bar
first
amendment
whistle-blower
cases
from
review
is
to
effectively
close
the
doors
to
the
military.
and
where
relief
is
only
sought
of
an
equitable
nature,
that
then
this
court
would
not
have
constitutional
power
exercised
by
the
federal
courts
over
the
military.
captain
van
drasek
asks
that
the
matter
be
returned
to
the
bcnr
or
the
district
court.
captain
van
drasek
in
both
courts
made
very
clear
that
the
appointment
by
general
carey
of
colonel
lawson
to
interpret
the
complaints
against
colonel
cooper,
the
appointment
of
a
peer
in
the
same
command,
was
violative
of
the
jag
manual;
was
a
procedural
impropriety
which
made
the
138
investigation
void
from
the
outset;
that
the
failure
to
do
a
formal
hearing,
that
the
failure
to
appoint
counsel,
indeed,
to
tell
john
van
drasek,
that
he
could
talk
to
a
jag
lawyer,
but
he
couldn't
establish
an
independent
attorney-client
relationship
with
a
lawyer;
all
of
those
procedural
irregularities
have
been
pled
by
the
petitioner
throughout.
thus,
he
has
done
nothing
other
than
by
the
law.
he
has
gone
to
every
court
which
this
court
suggested
in
chappell
v.
wallace.
he
has
come
before
this
court,
and
been
granted
an
opportunity
once
again
to
say
that
he
would
like
to
have
his
claim
heard
in
its
entirety
under
the
constitution
at
one
time
in
one
place.
thank
you
very
much.
