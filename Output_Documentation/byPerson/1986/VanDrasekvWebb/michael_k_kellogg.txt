mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court.
as
the
preceding
colloquy
indicates,
there
is
some
uncertainty
as
to
the
precise
question
presented
in
this
case.
in
his
petition,
petitioner
stated
the
question
at
issue
to
be,
whether
citizens
should
be
barred
from
all
redress
in
civilian
courts
for
constitutional
wrong
suffered
in
the
course
of
military
service.
now
we
explained
in
our
brief
why
we
felt
that
question
was
not
in
fact
presented
here.
the
reason
is
simple,
as
chief
justice
rehnquist
pointed
out
in
the
preceding
colloquy,
the
district
court
did
entertain
and
decide
petitioner's
constitutional
claims.
essentially,
he
raised
two
claims.
first,
he
charged
that
the
military's
processing
of
his
article
138
complaint
violated
his
fifth
amendment
due
process
rights.
the
district
court
specifically
considered
and
rejected
that
claim,
in
its
opinion
at
page
a6
of
the
petition,
the
court
said,
the
court
finds
that
the
processing
of
plaintiff's
article
138
complaint
comports
with
constitutional
requirements.
the
investigation,
report
of
findings,
and
remedial
action,
satisfied
the
minimum
standards
of
procedural
due
process.
that
finding
was
in
turn
affirmed
by
the
court
of
appeals,
and
petitioners
offered
no
reason
to
think
that
it
is
in
any
way
incorrect.
he
has
in
fact
failed
to
specify
any
procedural
defect
in
the
article
138
proceeding.
petitioner's
second
constitutional
claim
was
that
his
first
amendment
rights
were
violated.
that
claim
was
also
considered
and
rejected
by
the
district
court
on
the
same
page
of
its
opinion,
when
it
said,
plaintiff's
allegations
of
first
amendment
violations
similarly
do
not
warrant
relief.
now,
in
his
reply
brief,
petitioner
appears
to
acknowledge
that
his
constitutional
claims
were
decided
by
the
district
court.
he
argues,
however,
that
the
court
didn't
scrutinize
the
record,
the
entire
record,
before
deciding
those
constitutional
claims.
now
the
basis
for
that
claim
is
not
altogether
clear,
but
he
appears
to
rely
on
the
fact
that
the
court
declined
to
review
the
article
138
proceeding
for
substantive
correctness,
and
draws
from
that
the
conclusion
that
the
court
must
therefore
have
truncated
its
review
of
the
constitutional
claims
by
ignoring
any
facts
relevant
to
the
article
138
proceeding.
in
other
words,
the
court
shut
its
eyes
to
crucial
facts
underlying
the
constitutional
claims
before
it
decided
those
claims.
now
there's
no
basis
for
that
argument
whatsoever
in
the
record.
the
district
court
specifically
stated
that
it
was
reviewing
the
record
for
constitutional
violations,
and
that
it
found
none.
in
the
course
of
its
opinion,
it
canvassed
all
the
relevant
facts.
now
admittedly,
its
discussion
of
the
constitutional
claims
was
brief.
but
there's
a
very
simple
explanation
for
that.
the
district
court
discussed
in
some
detail,
in
the
context
of
the
review
of
the
bcnr
proceedings,
petitioner's
claims
that
his
fitness
reports
were
biased,
and
that
he
was
improperly
passed
over
for
promotion.
the
district
court
discussed
those
claims
in
detail,
and
affirmed
them
in
finding
that
the
bcnr's
decision
was
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
so
when
it
came
to
the
constitutional
claims,
the
underlying
factual
basis
for
those
claims
had
already
been
eliminated.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
we
understand
that...
what
the
district
court
meant
by
that
was
that
you
do
not
get
apa
review
of
an
article
138
proceeding
for
substantive
and
procedural
correctness,
as
if
it
were
the
decision
of
any
other
federal
agency,
for
example,
to
determine
whether
the
investigation
was
carried
out
in
accordance
with
military
regulations,
whether
the
investigating
officer
interviewed
enough
witnesses,
whether
he
weighed
the
credibility
of
the
witnesses
properly
and
reached
proper
results.
what
the
district
court
did
in
the
course
of
discussing
article
138
specifically
address
the
constitutional
claims.
it
declined
only
to
address
the
substance
of
the
article
138
proceeding.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
in
fact,
no.
in
fact
we
think--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--in
effect.
our
position
would
be
that
under
this
court's
precedents,
the
only
cases
that
a
military
serviceman
can
bring
directly
to
federal
court
are
cases
involving
statutes
that
are
alleged
to
be
unconstitutional
on
their
face.
but
when
he's
arguing
that
he
particularly,
in
the
circumstances
of
his
case,
was
subjected
to
unconstitutional
retaliation,
that
he's
required
to
exhaust
his
administrative
remedies
prior
to
doing
so.
and
that
therefore,
the
district
court
should
have
confined
itself
to
reviewing
the
decision
of
the
bcnr,
which
knocked
out
the
factual
underpinnings
of
his
constitutional
claims.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
it's
necessary
to
sort
of
separate
out
the
three
sets
of
events.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
yes.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
two-thirds
of
them.
the
petitioner
claims
that
he
was
wronged
in
three
different
ways.
first,
that
his
first
two
fitness
reports,
and
his
first
promotion
passover,
were
in
retaliation
for
his
complaints
that
he
made
about
sex
discrimination
at
the
officers
candidates
school.
second,
he
claims
that
he
was
transferred
out
of
the
officers
candidate
school,
and
removed
from
the
administrative
discharge
board
in
retaliation
for
his
votes
as
a
member
of
the
administrative
discharge
board.
third,
he
claims
that
his
second
promotion
passover
was
in
retaliation
for
having
filed
the
article
138
complaint.
now,
the
bcnr
specifically
addressed
and
rejected
the
first
and
the
third
of
those
claims.
in
other
words,
it
found
that
the
fitness
reports
were
not
biased,
and
the
first
promotion
passover
was
not
in
anyway
improper.
and
it
found
that
the
second
promotion
passover
was
not
in
retaliation
for
the
filing
of
the
article
138
complaint.
with
respect
to
the
transfer
out
of
ocs
and
the
removal
of
petitioner
from
the
administrative
discharge
board,
the
bcnr
commented
upon
those
events,
in
the
course
of
its
discussion;
but
those
events
were
not
specifically
relevant
to
the
claims
that
he
was
wrongfully
passed
over
for
promotion.
so
in
other
words,
the
bcnr
addressed
them
as
sort
of
background
material
perhaps
coloring--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--no,
because
they
wouldn't
be
reflected
in
his
service
record
in
that
respect.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
well,
i
suppose...
i'm
not
exactly
sure--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--as
far
as
the--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--the
transfer?
yes,
that
that
was
exhausted.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
because
it's
now
moot.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
then
under
this
court's
decision
in
orloff
v.
willoughby,
the
propriety
of
duty
assignments
is
not
a
fit
matter
for
judicial
review.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
it
would
be
more
a--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--it
would
be
more
a
question
of
prudence
rather
than
power
of
the
court.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
in
effect,
that
the
settled
reluctance
of
the
courts
to
intervene
in
internal
military
affairs
makes
the
propriety
of
the
duty
assignment
not
an
appropriate
consideration.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
other
claims,
he
could
obtain
review
ordinarily
on
review
of
a
bcnr
decision,
and
in
fact
he
did
so
in
this
case.
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
the
district
court
affirmed
the
findings
of
the
board
as
supported
by
substantial
evidence,
and
the
court
of
appeals
in
turn
affirmed
that,
and
petitioner
did
not
seek
certiorari
on
the
question
of
whether
the
board's
decision
was
in
fact
supported
by
substantial
evidence.
so
justice
stevens'
point
during
the
earlier
colloquy,
that
in
effect,
those
claims
are
out
of
the
case
now,
is
correct.
the
fitness
reports,
the
promotion
passovers,
are
no
longer
relevant
to
these
proceedings.
that
leaves
his
claims
that
he
was
improperly
transferred
out
of
the
officers
candidate
school,
and
removed
from
the
administrative
discharge
board.
but
as
we
explained,
those
claims
are
moot,
because
petitioner
is
no
longer
a
member
of
the
marines.
he
has
received
a
retirement
disability--
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
--pardon?
mr.
michael
k.
kellogg
and
they
aren't
reviewable
anyway.
in
sum,
therefore,
petitioner
now
acknowledges
that
the
question
upon
which
the
court
granted
certiorari
is
no
longer
presented
in
this
case.
the
question
which
he
has
tried
to
put
in
its
place
is
fact
bound,
and
in
any
event,
depends
upon
a
misreading
of
the
opinion
below.
furthermore,
there's
no
longer
a
justiciable
controversy
before
the
court.
under
the
circumstances,
we
would
recommend
that
the
petitioner
for
writ
of
certiorari
be
dismissed
as
improvidently
granted.
unless
the
court
has
any
further
questions--
