unknown
speaker
mr.
milliken,
you're
not
contending
that
the
district
court
didn't
review
the
constitutional
issue
on
this
case,
are
you?
unknown
speaker
well,
you're
really
complaining
that
he
didn't
rule
in
your
favor,
which
isn't
the
same
thing
as
to
say
that
you
got
no
judicial
review.
unknown
speaker
will
you
make
some
comment,
counsel,
about
whether
the
case
is
or
is
not
moot?
unknown
speaker
but
may
i
ask
you,
in
that
inquiry,
can
the
review
involve
any
matters
that
happened
after
his
second
failure
to
be
promoted?
i
gather
the
first
one
back
in
april
of
'82.
unknown
speaker
but
he
had
not
yet...
at
that
time
he
hadn't
even
started
to
serve
on
this
review
board
at
the
officers'
candidate
school,
had
he?
unknown
speaker
but
is
anything
subsequent
to
the
date
of
the
second
passover
relevant?
unknown
speaker
may
of
'83?
unknown
speaker
but
is
it
not
true
that
if
you
do
not
succeed
in
having
the
second
passover
reviewed
or
corrected
in
some
way,
that
then
his
failure
to
be
promoted
to
major
was
automatic?
i
mean,
his
discharge
was
going
to
follow
automatically.
unknown
speaker
but
even
if
you're
right
about
that,
that
didn't
affect
his
military
status.
unknown
speaker
mr.
milliken--
unknown
speaker
--i'm
having
a
hard
time
understanding
what
legal
issues
you
think
we
ought
to
address
here.
it
isn't
a
bit
clear
to
me.
is
it...
are
you
arguing
that
the
courts
have
an
obligation
to
review
article
138
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
is
that
what
we're
talking
about,
the
issue
of
whether
federal
courts
can
review
article
138
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
well,
what
if
we
think
the
courts
below
solved
the
constitutional
questions;
they
just
ruled
against
you.
then
what's
left?
unknown
speaker
you
mean,
all
138
proceedings?
unknown
speaker
mr.
milliken,
i
have
to
confess,
i'm
a
little
bit
puzzled
about
the
procedural
posture
of
the
case.
as
i
understood
there
is
really...
there
are
two
separate
proceedings,
the
article
138
proceeding
and
the
bcnr
proceeding.
is
that
correct,
or
am
i
wrong?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
will
have
to
go
a
little
slower
for
me,
because
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
the
whole
procedure
as
perhaps
i
should
be.
but
you
say
they
are
separate
procedures,
the
138
procedure
and
the
bcnr
procedure?
unknown
speaker
and
is
the
bcnr
procedure
the
one
that
dealt
with
the
fitness
reports
and
his
failure
to
be
promoted?
unknown
speaker
all
right.
and
you're
asking
us...
basically,
you're
asking
for
review
of
the
article
138
proceeding,
as
i
understand
it?
unknown
speaker
but
if
we
should
conclude
that
there
was
enough
evidence,
and
there
was
no
procedural
defect
in
the
bcnr
proceeding
dealing
with
the
fitness
reports
and
the
failed
two
pass-overs,
doesn't
that
put
an
end
to
the
case
insofar
as
we're
dealing
with
his
military
status?
and
then
there's
a
separate
problem
about
whether
he
had
some
kind
of
right
to
an
apology
and
all
the
rest
of
it
under
the
138
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
well,
the
bcnr
agrees
with
you;
there
were
other
things,
that's
right.
but
they
concluded
that
the
passovers
were
proper,
as
i
understood
it.
but
there
were
other
reasons.
he
had
a
couple
of
other
situations
in
which
his
commanding
officer
thought
he
would
have
preferred
to
have
a
different
person
in
the
assignment.
unknown
speaker
then
they
went
on
to
and
said
it
wasn't
critical
to
the
decision,
did
they
not?
unknown
speaker
where
are
you
reading
from?
what
was
the
page
cite?
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
this
is
not
on
the
whistle-blower
issue;
this
is
on
the
command
influence
issue.
unknown
speaker
yes,
but
the
last
sentence
in
the
paragraph
is,
finally
the
board
notes
that
neither
of
these
reports
could
have
been
influenced
by
petitioner's
voting
on
the
adb
because
he
was
not
appointed
to
serve
on
the
adb
until
after
the
reports
had
been
submitted.
unknown
speaker
well,
mr.
milliken,
are
you
suggesting
that
the
same
standard
governs
review
of
what
you
describe
as
a
whistle-blower
claim
within
the
military
as
governs
in
a
schoolteacher's
claim
as
in
mt.
healthy?
unknown
speaker
so
what
difference
is
there
in
the
standard
of
review
in
the
case
of
your
client
as
opposed
to
mr.
doyle
in
the
mt.
healthy
case?
unknown
speaker
well,
you
say,
in
effect,
there's
no
difference
then?
because
i
take
it
in
any
of
these
kind
of
whistle-blower
claims,
as
you
describe
them,
there
is
a
constitutional
claim?
unknown
speaker
well,
i
think
that
a
schoolteacher
has
a
tiny
bit
more
of
the
right
of
freedom
of
speech
than
a
military
private
has;
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
i
didn't
say
the
court.
i
said
am
i
right?
unknown
speaker
well,
then,
there
is
a
difference.
well,
why
don't
you
recognize
that
there's
a
difference?
unknown
speaker
mr.
milliken?
unknown
speaker
the
administrative
procedure
act
excludes
from
judicial
review...
it
says,
agency
means
each
authority
of
the
government
of
the
united
states,
but
does
not
include
courts
martial
and
military
commissions.
now,
why
would
congress
not
want
us
to
review
courts
martial
and
military...
either
one
of
these
bodies,
would
you
consider
either
one
of
them
a
military
commission.
unknown
speaker
well,
why
would
congress...
i
presume
that
the
decisions
that
can
be
made
by
court
martials
and
military
commissions
are
even
more
significant
than
the
decisions
that
can
be
made
by
this
body,
by
these
bodies?
unknown
speaker
what
about
commissions?
unknown
speaker
i'm
just
curious
as
to
why
you
think
this
is
reviewable
in
article
iii
courts,
and
yet
congress
saw
fit
to
exclude
courts
martial
and
military
commissions
from
article
iii
courts,
which
are
very...
you
know,
i
assume
that
review
in
an
article
iii
court
is
more
significant
than
review
anywhere
else.
and--
unknown
speaker
--it's
been
excluded
specifically
for
courts
martial
and
military
commissions.
yet
you
say
that
these
kind
of
determinations
can
be
for
a
whistle
blower,
never
mind
for
someone
who's
been
court
martialed,
can
be
trotted
off
to
article
iii
courts.
it
just
seems
strange
to
me.
unknown
speaker
there's
no
"s"
in
that,
by
the
way.
it's
the
administrative
procedure
act.
unknown
speaker
i
have
a
special
love
for
that.
and
when
people
say
it
wrong,
it
gets
me.
unknown
speaker
may
i
just
ask
you
this,
mr.
kellogg,
what
do
you
make
of
the
roman
numeral
i
in
the
district
court's
opinion:
this
court
lacks
jurisdiction
to
review
the
merits
of
plaintiff's
article
138
claim?
isn't
there
some
tension
between
that
and
going
ahead
and
reviewing
the
merits
and
deciding
them?
unknown
speaker
well,
do
you
agree
that
the
district
court
did
have
jurisdiction
to
review
the
constitutional
claims
asserted
in
the
138
proceeding?
unknown
speaker
so
in
other
words,
the
portions
of
the
opinion
on
the
merits
that
you
rely
on
are
portions
that
he
shouldn't
have
written
under
your
view;
is
that
right?
unknown
speaker
except
that
the
bcnr,
as
i
remember
it,
didn't
really
deal
with
the
whistle-blower
claims.
am
i
wrong
on
that?
it's
hard
to
keep
all
this
straight.
unknown
speaker
before
you
do
that,
could
you
tell
me
whether
you
think
the
bcnr
dealt
with
the
whistle-blower
claims?
unknown
speaker
you
think
they
did?
unknown
speaker
he
probably
couldn't
have
presented
those
to
the
board,
could
he?
unknown
speaker
yes,
yes.
so
this...
that
particular
claim
was
just
going
to
go
unreviewed,
even
administratively.
unknown
speaker
your
argument
about
exhausting
administrative
remedies,
that
claim
was
exhausted.
unknown
speaker
transfer.
unknown
speaker
and
so
why
he
can't
he
have
that
action
reviewed?
unknown
speaker
suppose
it
weren't?
unknown
speaker
and
it...
what
would
it
be,
a
jurisdictional
thing?
unknown
speaker
or
just
not
a
cause
of
action?
unknown
speaker
so
the
complaint
is
filed,
and
you
say,
sorry,
but
this
isn't
for
us?
unknown
speaker
of
course,
if
you
win
on
that...
if
that's
true,
what
about
the
other
claims?
unknown
speaker
and
he
did.
unknown
speaker
and
they
aren't
reviewable
anyway?
unknown
speaker
and
they
aren't
reviewable
anyway?
