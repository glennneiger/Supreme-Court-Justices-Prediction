rehnquist
mr.
devault,
you
may
proceed
whenever
you
are
ready:
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
you
have
to
prove
that
two
or
more
people
conspired
to
defraud?
chief
justice
rehnquist
did
the
indictment
name
the
agency
which
your
client
is
charged
with
defrauding?
chief
justice
rehnquist
is
that
the
government's
argument
here,
that
you
defrauded
seminole
and
therefore
you
are
guilty,
or
is
it
the
government's
argument
that
you
defrauded
rea?
chief
justice
rehnquist
does
the
government
allege
or
prove
that
there
were
any
fraudulent
representations
or
practices
made
to
the
rea
by
your
clients?
chief
justice
rehnquist
if
your
clients
had
made
false
representations
to
the
rea
and
the
jury
found
them,
on
substantial
evidence,
guilty,
you
wouldn't
be
raising
this
point,
would
you?
chief
justice
rehnquist
in
other
words,
if
your
clients
went
to
the
rea
and
made
a
bunch
of
false
statements
and
the
guy
at
the
rea
says,
"well,
i
don't
believe
a
word
you're
saying
and
i'm
not
going
to
pay
any
attention
to
you.
"
there
is
no...
you
are
not
guilty
of
fraud
just
from
having
made
the
representations
if
they
don't
induce
action?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
i
mean...
i
don't
think
the
point
really
is
that.
supposing
that
your
clients
go
to
the
united
states
treasury,
something
that
is
clearly
the
united
states,
and
just
make
totally
false
representations
trying
to
get
the
treasury
to
do
something,
and
the
initial
person
they
contact
at
the
treasury
says
"no,
i'm
not
going
to
have
anything
to
do
with
you,
i
think
you're
liars.
"
now,
have
they
defrauded...
have
they
conspired
to
defraud
the
united
states?
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
even
though
no
action
is
taken.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
devault.
we'll
hear
now
from
you,
mr.
lazarus.
chief
justice
rehnquist
but
when
the
va
loans
money
to
a
builder
or
advances
money
to
a
builder
to
build
a
house
for
someone
who
is
entitled
to
a
va
loan,
you
don't
generally
say
that
the
builder
is
doing
it
on
behalf
of
the
va.
chief
justice
rehnquist
well,
maybe
the
contractor
that's
building
the
house
has
to
meet
certain
va
specifications
for
materials
and
so
forth.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
lazarus.
mr.
devault,
you
have
two
minutes
remaining.
chief
justice
william
h.
rehnquist
thank
you,
mr.
devault.
the
case
is
submitted.
