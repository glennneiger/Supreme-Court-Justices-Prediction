justice
o'connor
mr.
devault,
in
this
circumstance
does
the
rea
have
rules
and
regulations
and
standards
to
meet
for
contracts
of
this
type?
justice
o'connor
i
thought
so,
and
was
it
not
the
fact,
then,
that
it
was
alleged
that
the
conspiracy
here
was
one
to
avoid
those
requirements
that
rea
would
have
imposed
on
contracting?
justice
o'connor
well,
is
it
your
assertion
that
none
of
the
requirements
imposed
by
the
rea
were
violated
by
what
was
done
here?
justice
o'connor
--is
this
a
case
of
jury...
alleged
juror
incompetence,
or
a
case
of
alleged
juror
misconduct,
and
does
it
make
a
difference?
justice
o'connor
mr.
lazarus,
your
opposition
seeks
to
characterize
what
happened
as
a
question...
raising
a
question
of
juror
incompetence
rather
than
misconduct.
justice
o'connor
would
there
be
a
difference
in
how
we
would
view
it?
justice
o'connor
could
juror
misconduct
or
temporary
incompetence
rise
to
such
a
level
that
it
becomes
a
constitutional
question
of
due
process
and
a
fair
trial?
