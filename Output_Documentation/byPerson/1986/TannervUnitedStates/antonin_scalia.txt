justice
scalia
let
me
get
this
clear.
if
the
fraud
against
seminole
had
been
so
severe
as
to
cause
seminole
to
lose
so
much
money
that
they
could
not
make
the
payments
on
the
loans,
and
rea's
guarantee
was
called
in,
then
you
think
this
indictment
would
lie?
is
that
right?
justice
scalia
why
does
that
make
it
any...
well,
this
isn't
an
indictment
for
fraud
against
the
united
states.
it's
an
indictment
for
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states.
justice
scalia
now,
it
seems
to
me
basic
law
that
you
don't
have
to
achieve
the
end
of
your
conspiracy
to
be
guilty
of
conspiracy.
so,
if
i
set
out
to
rob
enough
money
from
seminole
that
it
might
cause
seminole
to
have
to
default
and
the
government
to
have
to
come
up
with
a
guarantee,
if
i
set
out
to
do
that
whether
i
achieve
it
or
not
i
should
be
guilty
of
conspiracy,
shouldn't
i?
justice
scalia
you
have
to
actually
intend
to
cause
a
loss
to
the
federal
government;
it's
not
enough
that
you
want
to
defraud
seminole
of
every
penny
it
owns,
that
wouldn't
do?
justice
scalia
well,
there
is
a
very
close
connection.
if
seminole
has
no
pennies
left,
the
government
has
to
make
good
on
seminole's
obligations.
that's
not
enough
of
a
connection?
justice
scalia
i'm
not
sure
you're
wrong
about
your
whole
case,
but
i
do
think
it's
very
difficult
to
draw
the
line
where
you
would
do
it,
and
that
is
to
say
that
so
long
as
the
government
has
to
cough
up
some
money
the
indictment
is
good,
but
if
it
doesn't
have
to
cough
up
any
money
the
indictment
is
bad.
i
can't
see
that
line
at
all.
justice
scalia
you
would
concede,
i
take
it,
that
if
the
whole
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
had
been
to
get
those
false
misrepresentations
made
to
rea,
that
would
be
a
different
case?
justice
scalia
material
to
the
program
as
inducements
to
act?
i
mean
rea
requires
this
information
for
some
good
reason,
even
if
not
for
putting
out
the
initial
loan.
justice
scalia
then
at
least
for
the
purpose
of
securing
the
future
performance
for
which
the
loan
was
given,
that
is
something
the
government
has
an
interest
in,
doesn't
it?
justice
scalia
and
you
would
take
the
position
that
so
long
as
it's
done
after
the
money's
been
advanced,
even
if
the
very
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
were
prominently
in
mind,
to
get
a
false
misrepresentation
to
be
made
to
rea,
that
would
not
be
enough?
your
case,
i
take
it,
is
somewhat
different.
in
your
case
your
client
really
didn't
care
whether
a
false
representation
was
made
to
rea
or
not.
the
effect
of
what
they
allegedly
did
would
have
been
to
cause
a
false
representation
to
be
made
but
that
wasn't
what
they
were
after?
justice
scalia
you'd
say
even
if
they
were
after
that,
even
if
that
was
the
whole
object
of
their
conspiracy,
we
couldn't--
justice
scalia
now,
how
do
you
distinguish
this
case
from
any
case
in
which
a
federally
subsidized
entity
is
defrauded?
justice
scalia
a
lot
of
recipients
do.
they're
not
performing
it
on
behalf
of
rea.
rea
gave
the
subsidy
in
order
to
achieve
a
particular
result
and
they
are
overseeing
it
to
be
sure
that
that
result
is
indeed
accomplished.
that
is
the
case
with
a
lot
of
loan
programs.
justice
scalia
they
are
a
federal
agent?
justice
scalia
the
limitation
asserted
here
by
the
defendants
is
the
united
states.
the
statute
prohibits
defrauding
the
united
states
in
any
manner?
justice
scalia
so,
the
"in
any
manner"
doesn't
do
you
any
good.
justice
scalia
what
we
are
arguing
about
here
is
whether
this
is
a
defrauding
of
the
united
states
or
not.
justice
scalia
what
is
"on
behalf
of
the
united
states?
"
it
seems
to
me
that
is
the
joker
in
the
deck
here.
what
do
you
mean
by
"on
behalf"...
you
say
it's
not
an
agent,
but
it
has
to
be
"on
behalf"...
this
is
a
criminal
statute,
now.
people
have
to
know
whether
they're
violating...
how
do
i
know
when
somebody
is
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states
or
not?
justice
scalia
the
only
thing...
some
of
your
argument
about
the
necessity
of
preserving
modern
functions
of
government
is
reduced
by
the
fact
that
you
have
1001.
if,
indeed,
you
are
causing
a
false
misrepresentation...
if
you're
conspiring
to
cause
a
false
misrepresentation
to
be
made,
you
have
a
readily
available
means
of
getting
the
individual
without
leading
the
law
into
this
twilight
zone
of
somebody
who's
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
it
wouldn't
matter
whether
you--
justice
scalia
--i
guess
what
you're
relying
on
is
the
fact
that
anything
that
goes
on
in
the
jury
room
is
observed
by
the
other
jurors,
and
if
somebody
pulls
a
gun
presumably
one
of
the
jurors
could
tell
the
court
about
it
and
the
court
can
conduct
an
inquiry
right
then
and
there.
justice
scalia
whereas
outside
influences
can't
be
observed
by
the
other
jurors
necessarily,
so
it
wouldn't
necessarily
come
to
light?
justice
scalia
yes,
i
have
further
questions.
suppose
we
don't
agree
with
you
on
section
371.
can
the
mail
fraud
conviction
stand?
justice
scalia
the
indictment
with
regard
to
mail
fraud
charged
defrauding
both
rea
and
seminole.
now,
don't
you
have
to
prove
both
parts
of
that?
justice
scalia
you
couldn't
defraud
rea
without
defrauding
seminole
in
the
process?
justice
scalia
was
that
necessary
under
the
indictment?
justice
scalia
just
because
it
is
in
conjunction
you
have
to
prove
all
of
it?
i
mean,
i
accuse
you
of
conspiracy
to
kill
three
people
and
i
only
prove
that
you
conspired
to
kill
two
people,
you
walk
free,
is
that
the
way
the
world
works?
