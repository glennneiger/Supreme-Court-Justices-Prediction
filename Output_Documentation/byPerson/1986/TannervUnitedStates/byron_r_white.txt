i
suppose...
would
you
be
making
the
same
argument
if
these
two
gentlemen,
mr.
conover,
was
it--
justice
white
--and
mr.
tanner,
if
they
did
something
that
made
it
more
likely
that
the
rea
would
be
called
upon
to
live
up
to
its
guarantee?
justice
white
well,
assume...
just
assume
that
two
people
conspired
to
use
materials
in
building
a
road
that
were
so
bad
that
they
had
to
do
it
all
over
again,
and
they
had
to...
and
the
rea
had
to...
and
seminole
ran
out
of
money.
justice
white
well,
the
loss
would
be
to
seminole.
justice
white
exactly.
justice
white
wasn't
there
an
allegation
in
this
case
that
the
specifications
were
so
drawn
that
they
favored
tanner?
justice
white
and
hence,
that
perhaps
better,
lower
bids
weren't
forthcoming?
justice
white
it
may
be
that
this
job
cost
seminole
more
than
it
should
have,
under
the
allegations?
justice
white
do
you
allege
seminole
or
the
rea,
or
both?
justice
white
so,
it's
both?
justice
white
--what
went
on
in
the
jury
room--
justice
white
--any
juror's
testimony
about
any
outside
influence?
justice
white
well,
the
statement
you
made
covered
that.
justice
white
what
is
supposed
to
happen
if
the
bailiff
or
somebody
else
says
that
when
the...
at
intermissions
or
overnight
he
furnished
juror
so
and
so
with
cocaine
and
saw
him
using
it
just
before
they
went
into
the
courtroom,
and
it's
pretty
obvious
that
a
juror
was
under
the
influence
of
cocaine.
then
what
happens?
justice
white
let's
just
say
it
didn't.
it
didn't
arise.
there
was
a
verdict
of
guilty
and
then
this
evidence
comes
up,
and
the
claim
is
the
juror
didn't
know
what
he
was
doing.
what
happens
then?
justice
white
well,
he
says,
"i
believe
you".
he
says,
"i
believe
the
juror
was
under
the
influence
of
cocaine
when
he
was
in
the
jury
room.
"
justice
white
he
may
not
call
any
juror
or
investigate
through
any
of
the
jurors?
