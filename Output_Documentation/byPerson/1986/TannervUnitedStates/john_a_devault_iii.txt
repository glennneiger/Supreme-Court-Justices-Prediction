mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
this
case
is
here
on
petition
for
writ
of
certiorari
to
the
united
states
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit,
which
affirmed
criminal
convictions
for
conspiracy
and
mail
fraud
arising
out
of
the
award
of
contracts
by
seminole
electric
cooperative,
a
private
florida
corporation.
two
issues
are
presented
for
this
court's
consideration.
first,
whether
section
371
of
title
18
u.s.c.,
which
prohibits
conspiracies
to
defraud
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof,
extends
to
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
a
private
corporation
which
is
neither
an
agency
nor
a
representative
of
the
federal
government,
and
which
only
connection
with
the
federal
government
is
that
it
is
the
recipient
of
a
loan
guaranteed
by
the
rural
electrification
administration.
secondly,
where
a
sworn
affidavit
that
jurors
were
consuming
large
amounts
of
alcohol,
were
utilizing
and
dealing
in
marijuana,
and
were
ingesting
cocaine
throughout
the
course
of
a
complex
criminal
proceeding,
required
an
evidentiary
hearing
in
order
to
make
a
determination
as
to
whether
these
jurors
were
rendered
incompetent
to
consider
and
decide
the
case
in
violation
of
their
sixth
amendment
rights.
seminole
electric
cooperative
is
a
florida
corporation
formed
by
11
rural
electric
cooperatives
in
the
state
of
florida
for
the
purpose
of
generating
and
transmitting
electrical
energy
in
north
and
central
florida.
that
corporation
in
1979
made
application
through
the
rea
to
borrow
$1.1
billion
from
the
federal
financing
bank
in
order
to
construct
a
coal-fired
generating
plant
near
polacta,
florida.
as
part
of
the
construction
of
that
plant,
it
was
necessary
to
construct
a
patrol
road
beneath
an
electrical
transmission
line
which
extended
from
the
coal-fired
plant
to
a
substation
outside
of
ocala,
a
distance
of
practically
51
miles.
that
patrol
road
was
in
order
to
construct
the
line
itself
and
later
to
maintain
the
road
and
the
transmission
facilities.
that
original
contract
was
awarded
to
jernigan
construction
company
out
of
missouri.
in
1979,
work
on
the
plant
and
the
patrol
road
began,
and
by
march
of
1981
it
became
apparent
that
the
materials
being
utilized
by
jernigan
were
insufficient
for
the
purpose.
they
simply
would
not
compact
sufficiently
to
hold
the
trucks
and
vehicles
that
had
to
transgress
this
road.
accordingly,
the
officials
at
seminole
electric
directed
the
director
of
procurement,
the
petitioner
here,
mr.
conover,
to
find
another
source
of
material
to
construct
the
road.
mr.
conover,
in
his
position
as
director
of
procurement,
went
to
his
friend
anthony
tanner
who
was
a
local
developer
and
is
also
a
petitioner
here.
mr.
tanner
owned
a
lime
rock
mine
in
the
area
and
suggested
the
use
of
lime
rock
overburden
as
a
material
to
be
used
in
place
of
the
sugar
sand
material
which
jernigan
was
attempting
to
use.
that
material
was
used
on
an
interim
basis
under
a
purchase
order
after
being
inspected
by
the
engineering
department
of
seminole
electric.
the
material
proved
satisfactory.
because
of
internal
policies
of
seminole
electric,
a
bid
was
required
for
any
project
which
cost
more
than
$200,000.
accordingly,
specifications
were
drawn
up
for
two
contracts,
one
for
a
fill
contract
which
utilized
the
same
specifications
of
the
material
being
submitted
by
mr.
tanner
under
the
purchase
order,
and
the
second
for
spreading
contract
to
complete
work
on
the
road.
both
of
those
contracts
were
let
for
bid
and
petitioner
tanner
was
low
bidder
with
respect
to
each.
accordingly,
he
was
awarded
the
contracts
and
completed
construction
of
the
patrol
roads
in
late
1981.
just
prior
to
the
completion
of
construction,
one
of
the
electrical
cooperatives
raised
questions
concerning
the
business
relationships
between
tanner
and
conover
and
whether
they
violated
the
conflict
of
interest
policies
of
seminole
electric.
as
a
result
of
that
investigation,
an
indictment
was
brought
in
the
united
states
district
court
in
june
of
1983.
that
indictment
charged
in
count
one
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
under
section
371
by
impeding
the
lawful
function
of
the
rea
in
administering
and
enforcing
its
guaranteed
loan
program.
it
contended
that
tanner
was
given
an
advantage
over
competitors
by
the
specifications
drawn
for
the
contracts,
and
that
tanner
and
conover,
by
their
personal
business
dealings,
violated
the
conflict
of
interest
policy
of
seminole
and
therefore
the
program
was
not
honestly
and
fairly
administered.
the
court
of
appeals
for
the
eleventh
circuit
affirmed
these
convictions
and
found
that
what
the
court
termed
371,
based
on
the
interest
of
the
federal
government
in
seeing
that
the
entire
project
was
administered
honestly,
and
efficiently,
and
without
corruption
and
waste.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
there
was
a
special
concurring
opinion
by
judge
hill,
your
honor,
and
he
consented
and
concurred
in
the
judgment
because
he
felt
bound
by
a
prior
fifth
circuit
decision.
but
with
respect
to
the
conspiracy
issue,
judge
hill
evidenced,
and
stated
in
his
special
concurring
opinion,
that
if
he
were
not
bound
by
that
opinion
he
would
find
that
these
actions
did
not
violate
section
371.
we
raise
in
point
one
to
this
court
the
fact
that
this
court
has
never
heretofore
upheld
a
conviction
based
on
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
under
section
371,
where
the
defendants
neither
defrauded
the
federal
government
of
its
funds
or
property,
nor
interfered
with
a
u.s.
government
official
or
their
agents
performing
an
official
function
of
the
federal
government.
indeed,
given
the
pervasive
nature
of
federal
assistance
programs
and
guarantees,
an
affirmance
of
this
conviction
under
371,
we
suggest
would
lead
to
limitless
boundaries
and
in
fact
create
a
new
national
all-inclusive
criminal
code.
section
371
has
two
parts.
the
first
part
of
the
statute,
which
is
the
one
most
often
utilized,
prohibits
conspiracies
to
commit
any
substantive
offense
against
the
united
states.
the
second
part
of
the
statute
which
is
at
issue
on
this
petition,
and
which
is
much
less
frequently
used,
prohibits
conspiracies
to
defraud
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof.
therefore,
when
an
indictment
charges
the
second
part
of
section
371,
it
is
the
conspiracy
itself
which
is
the
substantive
crime.
it
is
not
necessary
for
the
government
to
allege
and
prove
a
substantive
federal
offense
as
it
is
in
the
first
part
of
the
statute.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
exactly,
your
honor,
of
course,
in
order
to
reach
the
conspiracy
you
would
have
to
prove
that
initial
element,
my
point
being
that
whereas
the
first
section
is
anchored
to
a
substantive
federal
offense,
so
there
is
no
question
as
to
what
the
defendant
is
being
charged,
the
second
section
is
not
so
anchored.
it
permits
a
charge
of
defrauding
the
united
states
or
any
agency
thereof.
here
we
suggest
on
this
record
there
was
no
evidence
that
the
government,
the
federal
government
or
any
agency
thereof
suffered
any
monetary
or
property
loss,
nor
was
there
any
evidence
of
any
interference
with
a
lawful
function
of
government.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
it
named
the
rea
as
the
agent
which
guaranteed
the
loan,
your
honor.
but
the
allegations
can
be
read
that
the
actual
party
being
defrauded
was
seminole
electric.
that
is
the
party,
of
course,
that
was
employed
but
rea
was
named
as
the
guarantor
and
the
federal
agency
that
was
being
defrauded.
seminole
electric
is
a
private
florida
corporation,
and
the
federal
government
has
no
proprietary
interest
whatsoever
in
that
company.
the
only
connection
between
this
conspiracy
and
the
rea
or
the
federal
government
is
the
fact
that
there
was
a
guaranteed
construction
loan,
guaranteed
by
the
rea,
two
years
prior
to
these
contracts
which
are
here
at
issue.
looking
to
the
legislative
history
of
section
371,
there
is
simply
no
showing
that
congress
intended
to
punish
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
a
purely
private
entity.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
the
government's
argument
is
that
we
defrauded
rea,
your
honor.
but
the
fact
is
that
rea
was
simply
a
guarantor
of
the
loan.
thus,
we
suggest,
there
was
no
monetary
or
property
loss
to
the
rea
nor
was
any
governmental
function
of
the
rea
interfered
with.
as
judge
hill
pointed
out,
congress
certainly
could,
had
it
decided
to
do
so,
have
required
or
permitted
rea
to
construct
rural
electric
plants.
it
chose
not
to
do
so.
rea
does
not
have
that
function.
rea,
as
mr.
wright,
the
general
manager
of
seminole
electric
testified,
was
the
banker.
he
said
they
had
no
part
in
the
administration
of
seminole
electric.
they
simply
were
the
banker.
so,
i
concede
that
is
the
government's
argument,
but
we
suggest
that
on
the
indictment
and
on
the
facts
of
this
record
there
is
no
showing
of
any
fraud
with
respect
to
rea.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
yes.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
justice
white,
i
don't
believe
that
a
likelihood
of
damage
would
in
itself
be
sufficient,
absent
some
federal
purpose.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
if
there
was
evidence
of
a
proprietary
loss,
as
in
your
honor's
example,
then
it
would
fit
within
this
court's
prior
decisions
which
say
that--
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
--i
thought
your
honor's
example
suggested
that
the
rea
would
be
required
to
extend--
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
--additional
funds,
and
that
there
would
be
some
loss
to
the
federal
government
because
of
the
inability--
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
--there
was,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
there
were
allegations
of
that,
your
honor,
and
of
course
for
purposes
of
this
petition
we
accept
those
allegations
and
the
proof
there
under--
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
--that
was
the
allegation,
your
honor.
but
the
difference
there...
what's
missing
is
the
fact
that
there
was
not
shown
in
evidence
at
this
trial
of
any
proprietary
or
property
lost
to
the
federal
government.
the
loss
was
to
a
private
corporation.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
i
believe
your
honor,
that
if
there
were
shown,
on
your
honor's
hypothetical,
that
there
was
a
loss
to
the
federal
government
because
of
the
defaulting,
then
you
could
have,
under
this
court's
decisions,
fraud
against
the
united
states.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
well,
first,
your
honor,
there
was
no
such
allegation
on
this
indictment
with
respect
to
the
purposes
of
conspiracy.
and
secondly,
in
order
to
draw
such
an
indictment,
there
would
have
to
be,
we
submit,
an
allegation
of
a
loss
or
at
least
a
conspiracy
purporting
to
cause
a
loss
to
the
federal
government.
those
allegations
do
not
appear
on
this
indictment.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
absent
a
connection
between
seminole
and
the
federal
government
or
an
agency
thereof.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
your
honor,
only
if
there
is
a
default
under
the
loan
would
the
federal
government
have
to
make
good
on
seminole's
obligations.
here,
not
only
was
there
an
absence
of
proof
of
such
default,
but
there
was
no
charge
on
the
indictment
that
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
was
such
as
to
cause
a
proprietary
loss
to
the
federal
government.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
well,
in
point
of
fact,
this
court
has
not
heretofore
drawn
the
line
and
indicated
what
the
line
should
be.
what
this
court
has
said,
beginning,
i
guess,
with
united
states
versus
hirsch.
in
1879
which
was
the
first
case
to
construe
the
statute
after
it
was
enacted
in
1867
as
part
of
the
internal
revenue
code,
was
that
there
had
to
be
almost
a
physical
relationship
between
the
alleged
conspirators
and
the
government.
in
each
of
the
cases
which
have
appeared
before
this
court
there
has
been
some
sort
of
a
direct
relationship
either
of
a
monetary
or
proprietary
interest
or
a
federal
governmental
function.
and
in
this
instance
we
suggest
that
the
net
that
the
government
seeks
to
throw
out
here
would
take
in
any
company,
or
indeed
any
individual,
where
there
is
any
type
of
a
federal
connection.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
there
was
no
proof,
your
honor,
of
which
i
am
aware
that
showed
a
direct
representation
that
was
fraudulent
to
the
rea.
there
was
testimony
which,
after
the
fact,
concerned
the
question
of
whether
a
bonding
company
was
on
a
bonding
list
or
not.
but
with
respect
to
the
contracts
themselves
which
were
the
contracts
which
were
at
issue
in
the
indictment,
i
know
of
no
such
proof.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
if
it
was
a
false
representation
in
order
to
induce
the
rea
to
enter
into
the
agreement,
such
as
where
a
non-communist
affidavit
was
filed
to
induce
the
nlrb
act,
then,
your
honor,
i
agree.
i
would
not
be
making
the
point
if
that
was
an
integral
part.
in
point
of
fact,
here
the
agreement
to
loan
was
made
in
1979.
the
loan
was
made.
it
was
two
years
afterwards--
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
--they
did
make
that
allegation,
offered
proof,
your
honor,
of
that
fact
after
the
fact
with
respect
to
these
loans.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
well,
not
only
after
the
loans,
but
after
the
contracts
had
been
awarded.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
correct.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
that
is
correct,
your
honor.
and
i
think,
to
make
that
kind
of
charge,
there
would
have
to
be
explicit
in
that
that
the
representation
that
was
made
would
cause
the
federal
government
to
act
or
not
to
act.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
either
harmed
the
federal
government
or
interfered
with
a
federal
governmental
function.
it
doesn't
have
to
be
a
monetary
loss
to
the
federal
government.
we
concede
that
there
is
no
necessity
of
showing
a
monetary
loss
but
we
do
not
concede
that
here
there
is
shown
any
kind
of
a
detriment
to
a
federal
governmental
function.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
if
the
rea,
as
in
this
instance,
is
simply
a
guarantor
on
a
loan
with
a
private
corporation
and
is
not
engaged
in
a
federal
governmental
function,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
i
think
they
would
in
that
instance,
your
honor,
if
there
is
a
conspiracy
to
induce
the
federal
agency
to
take
some
action
that--
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
--if
the
purpose
of
the
conspiracy
is
to
induce
some
action,
then,
your
honor,
there
could
be
a
crime.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
it
does,
justice
o'connor,
and
those
that
were
put
in...
and
in
fact
several
of
them
appear
in
the
joint
appendix.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
i
think
not,
your
honor.
there
is
no
showing
that
the
requirements
that
were
set
out
by
the
rea
in
their
bulletin
40-6
which
is
in
the
joint
appendix,
or
otherwise,
specified
the
procedures
here.
indeed,
the
testimony
was
that
there
was
not
even
a
requirement
for
a
formal
or
informal
bidding
process.
it
could
have
been
let
by
informal
negotiations.
the
restrictions
placed
by
the
rea
on
seminole
electric
were
very
similar
to
that,
that
a
bank
places
on
any
borrower
in
connection
with
a
secured
transaction.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
your
honor,
i
think
of
no
requirement
that
the
rea
imposed
with
respect
to
the
awarding
of
the
contract
which
was
shown
to
be
violated
with
respect
to
the
entering
into
of
these
contracts.
now,
certainly
there
was
testimony,
as
justice
stevens
previously
pointed
out,
that
after
the
fact
there
were
some
representations
made,
but
there
was
no
charge
nor
proof
that
these
were
inducements
to
act
with
respect
to
the
rea.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
and
that
those
were
material
to
the
program
as
inducements
to
act,
i
would,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
yes,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
it
does
have
an
interest,
your
honor.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
correct.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
we
take
that
position,
your
honor,
and
it's
simply
because
this
rea
here,
although
rea
is
a
federal
agency,
it
was
not
performing...
in
this
case
it
was
not
performing
a
federal
function
with
respect
to
simply
guaranteeing
a
loan
made
to
seminole.
in
summary,
with
respect
to
point
one,
we
would
urge
that
the
rule
of
lenete
which
this
court
has
recently
reiterated
in
recent
cases
would
not
reach
conspiracy
to
defraud
in
this
case
because
the
statute
on
its
face
clearly
does
not
apply
to
this
instance,
nor
does
the
legislative
history
and
congressional
intent
with
respect
to
the
statute.
while
we
concede
that
the
federal
government
has
an
interest
in
the
program's
honesty
and
faithful
execution,
that
interest
along
is
not
sufficient
to
impose
a
criminal
verdict
with
respect
to
the
crime
here
at
issue.
if
this
court
holds
that
the
indictment
is
sufficient
to
charge
and
prove
a
crime
under
section
371,
then
it
must
reach
the
second
question
raised
by
the
petition,
which
is
whether
the
sixth
amendment's
guarantee
to
trial
by
an
impartial
jury
entitles
criminal
defendants
the
right,
before
a
trial
by
jury
capable
of
deciding
the
case
on
the
evidence,
and
more
particularly
whether
an
evidentiary
hearing
of
jurors
is
required
where
there
is
a
sworn
affidavit
that
jurors
were
utilizing
marijuana
and
ingesting
cocaine
during
the
course
of
the
proceedings.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
i
think
it
makes
a
difference,
your
honor,
and
we
have
specifically
cast
it
as
a
case
of
juror
incompetence
because
we
believe
the
test
should
be
as
to
whether
a
juror
would
be
physically
or
mentally
competent
to
qualify
as
a
juror
initially,
under
1865.
it
is,
of
course,
also
a
case
of
juror
misconduct,
but
in
order
to
reach
an
evidentiary
hearing
and
a
new
trial
we
respectfully
suggest
it
would
be
necessary
to
show
at
the
evidentiary
hearing
that
these
jurors
were
incompetent
to
render
a
fair
and
impartial
result
at
the
trial.
i
would
like
to
reserve
the
balance
of
my
time.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
mr.
chief
justice,
just
two
brief
points.
with
respect
to
the
indictment
and
the
jury
charge,
justice
scalia,
it
was
charged
both
a
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
by
defeating
the
lawful
functions
and
seminole
electric,
and
the
jury
was
so
charged
with
respect
to
both.
indeed,
in
the
court
of
appeals,
the
majority
opinion
when
we
raised
the
question
of
the
sufficiency
of
the
evidence
on
mail
fraud,
the
court
of
appeals'
opinion
at
page
14
of
the
appendix
to
the
petition
for
writ,
they
conceded
that
they
were
sustaining
the
mail
fraud
convictions
because...
should
be
affirmed
if
the
evidence
establishes
the
use
of
the
malls
in
connection
with
section
371
in
violation
of
count
one.
mr.
john
a.
devault,
iii
where
the
indictment
here
charged,
and
the
jury
was
instructed
that
the
conspiracy
consisted
of
both,
your
honor,
as
it
did
here,
then
the
charge
made
by
the
mail
fraud
charge
was
bound
up
in
the
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
and
both,
we
submit,
had
to
be
proved.
the
second
point
with
respect
to
371,
the
government
is
seeking
to
have
this
court
extend
the
provisions
of
section
371
to
an
intermediary
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
that
phrase
does
not
appear
in
the
statute.
that
phrase
does
not
appear
in
any
prior
opinion
of
this
court.
the
government
relies
on
the
dixon
case
where
a
closely
divided
court
looked
to
the
legislative
history
and
found
because
of
that
legislative
history,
it
would
uphold
the
conviction.
here
there
is
simply
no
legislative
history
by
which
this
court
can
look
and
extend
section
371.
in
such
instance,
we
suggest
it
more
appropriate
to
apply
the
rule
of
lenete
and
say
that
a
criminal
defendant
who
is
charged
and
convicted
under
statute
about
which
he
has
no
knowledge,
the
conviction
should
be
reversed.
thank
you.
