mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
mr.
chief
justice,
and
may
it
please
the
court:
at
the
outset,
i'd
like
to
address
justice
o'connor's
question
earlier.
we
have
no
doubt
that
petitioners
and
seminole
electric
here
were
bound
by
rea
bidding
procedures.
only
one
of
the
two
contracts
required
prior
approval
but
both
contracts,
as
the
rea
bulletins
in
the
record
suggest,
and
as
the
testimony,
uncontroverted
by
the
rea
official
on
pages
24,
27
and
32
of
the
joint
appendix
show,
the
bidding
requirements
designed
to
ensure
that
the
lowest
responsible
bidder
would
be
awarded
the
contract,
did
apply
to
these
contracts.
petitioners
seek
reversal
of
their
conviction
for
conspiring
to
defraud
the
united
states,
and
alternatively
claim
that
they
are
entitled
to
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
interrogate
the
jury
who
convicted
them.
because
we
believe
that
the
petitioners'
fraudulent
activities
fall
within
the
scope
of
section
371,
and
because
we
also
believe
that
the
post-verdict
interrogation
of
jurors
sought
by
petitioners
in
this
case
is
barred
by
rule
606b
of
the
federal
rules
of
evidence,
we
would
urge
the
court
to
affirm
the
decision
below.
in
our
view,
petitioners
conspired
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
two
distinct
respects.
first,
petitioners'
fraudulent
activities
obstructed
the
rea's
ability
to
accomplish
its
own
official
functions
in
this
case,
and
that
included
supervising
seminole
electric
to
insure
that
statutory
objectives
were
met,
that
federal
monies
were
not
wasted,
and
to
protect
the
substantial
federal
investment
in
this
federal
project,
over
$1.1
billion.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
don't
suggest
that
just
because
seminole
is
a
recipient
of
federal
financial
assistance
its
because
they
are
actually
performing
a
function
on
behalf
of
rea,
and
we
distinguish
it
because
if
you
look
at
the
terms
of
the
loan
contract,
the
rea
bulletin,
it
is
quite
apparent
that
seminole
is
being
supervised
closely
with
respect
to
almost
all
of
its
actions.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
and
for
that
reason,
when
the
degree
of
federal
oversight
is
such
that
they
are
in
effect
acting
on
behalf,
as
i
believe
counsel
for
petitioners
conceded
a
moment
ago,
and
that
is
that
seminole,
on
behalf
of
the
rea,
is
in
effect
constructing
an
electric
plant
to
provide
services
to
rural
residents
of
america.
and
we
believe
that
when
the
degree
of
oversight
is
so
great
that
that
amounts
to
a
private
company
acting
on
behalf,
performing
official
functions
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
do
not
say
they
are
federal
agents.
really,
all
we
are
asking
for
in
this
case
is
the
recognition
as
in
this
court's
decision
in
dixon,
that
in
certain
contexts
nonfederal
intermediaries
perform
official
functions
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
and
we
believe
that
the
scope
of
section
371
is
broad
enough
to
encompass
that
scenario.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it
would
depend
on...
we
aren't
saying
that
every
time
that
the
va
guarantees
a
loan
that
that's
enough,
but
in
those
instances
when
they
are
actually
being
supervised
in
that
capacity.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
and
if
in
that
case
the
va
required
that
oversight,
and
to
see
whether
or
not
those
requirements
were
being
met,
and
a
third
party
defrauded
the
builder
in
a
manner
which
caused
a
violation
of
those
requirements,
we
basically
have
the
same
case
and
we
believe
it
would
be
a
defraud
on
the
united
states.
federal
functions,
the
functions
of
the
va
would
be
obstructed,
their
ability
to
supervise,
and
the
result
would
be
that
federal
monies
which
were
intended
for
a
certain
purpose
would
have,
because
of
the
fraudulent
conduct,
been
diverted
to
an
unauthorized
purpose.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
allege
that
the
rea
was
defrauded
in
two
different
avenues,
one
directly
and
one
indirectly.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes.
as
a
general
matter,
we--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
the
indirect
fraud
is
that
by
defrauding
seminole
electric,
they
increased
the
chance
that
there
would
be
a
pecuniary
loss
to
the
federal
government
and
that
federal
statute
objectives
were--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
we
believe
that's
encompassed
within
the
indictment.
the
indictment
refers
to
obstructing
the
lawful
function
of
the
rea,
but
we
believe
that
in
this
instance,
that
seminole
was
acting
out
those
functions
of
the
rea.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
we
did
not.
and
actually--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that
is
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it
may
have
not
been
irrelevant
evidence,
maybe
unnecessary,
but
that's
not
a
problem.
as
a
general
matter
there
must
be
three
elements
to
maintain
a
prosecution
under
section
371.
first,
the
conspiracy
must
be
directed
against
the
united
states,
a
federal
agency,
or
we
believe,
an
intermediary
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
second,
the
effect
of
the
conspiracy
must
be
either
to
deprive
the
federal
government
of
its
monies
or
its
property,
or
to
obstruct
federal
government
official
functions,
which
we
believe
include
any
official
functions
being
performed
by
an
intermediary
on
behalf.
we
rely
on
our
construction
of
section
371
on
four
primary
sources
of
authority:
first,
the
unambiguous
yet
broad
statutory
language
of
section
371
which
condemns
conspiracies
to
defraud
the
united
states
in
any
manner.
it
includes
no
words
of
limitation.
second,
this
court's
settled
precedent
which
has
construed
section
371
to
bar
any
conspiracy
that
impairs,
obstructs,
or
defeats
the
lawful
functions
of
government,
and
not
merely
conspiracies
that
result
or
contemplate
the
loss
of
government
money
or
property.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
right,
and
we
believe--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
but
we
believe
that
"in
any
manner"
is
critical
here
because
as
this
court
has
recognized,
nonfederal
intermediaries
often
perform
official
functions
of
government
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
and
we
think
that
when
that
happens,
and
when
those
official
functions
are
obstructed
when
being
performed
by
someone
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
that
is
a
defraud
of
the
united
states
in
any
manner.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
basically
we
ask,
in
that
respect,
no
more
and
no
less
than
this
court's
decision
in
dixon
v.
united
states,
where
the
court
recognized
that
when
a
private
entity
is
administering
a
federally
supervised
and
federally
supported
project
on
behalf
of
the
united
states,
performing
official
functions
under
close
supervision,
that
in
those
instances
they
are
performing
official
functions
and
acting
on
behalf
of
the
united
states.
we
are
really
asking
for
no
more
than
application
of
that
standard,
recognition
that
the
broad
language
in
371
includes
that
possibility,
and
no
less.
simply
put,
in
our
view
the
language
of
section
371
is
sufficiently
broad
to
account
for
the
realities
of
modern
government
and
that
is
that
government
often
and
correctly
relies
on
nonfederal
entities
to
perform
official
functions
on
behalf
of
those
agencies
and
the
united
states.
the
administration
of
federal
welfare
programs
often
depends
on
such
programs.
maintenance
of
our
nation's
highways
often
depends
on
such
programs.
public
health
programs,
hud
programs,
state
department
programs,
environmental
protection
programs,
the
list
is
virtually
endless.
congress
intended,
we
believe,
to
protect
the
functions
of
government,
of
the
federal
government
when
they
were
defrauded
in
any
manner.
congress
determined
that
federal
jurisdiction
was
appropriate
with
reliance
on
federal
prosecutors
to
insure
that
the
federal
functions
would
be
served
and
be
adequately
protected.
in
light
of
this
legislative
mandate,
we
believe
that
a
construction
of
371,
consistent
both
with
its
historic
treatment,
the
statutory
language
and
the
realities
of
modern
government
is
warranted.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
it
might
be
a
violation
of
1001,
and
originally
the
indictment
had
included
a
1001
count,
but
for
tactical
reasons
the--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that
is
right.
of
course,
the
371
included
the
conspiracy
offense
while
1001,
you
wouldn't--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that
is
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
i
think
a
similar
instance
was
in
the
glasser
v.
united
states
case,
where
the
manner...
the
method
of
the
fraud
in
that
case
was
bribery
and
the
u.s.
charged
conspiracy
to
defraud
the
united
states
even
though
the
fraud
was
committed
through
bribery.
the
court
upheld
the
conviction
in
that
case,
although
of
course
the
u.s.
might
have
tried
to
allege
and
prove
conspiracy
to
commit
the
underlying
offense.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
petitioners
alternatively
request...
if
there
are
no
further
questions
on
the
first
issue.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
in
other
instances
there
may
be
obstruction
without
false
statements.
but
in
any
event,
the
fact
that
there
may
be
overlapping
federal
criminal
provisions
is
no
reason,
we
believe,
to
read
371
in
a
manner
which
ignores
the
plain
import
of
its
broad
statutory
language.
petitioners
alternatively
request
that
they
be
provided
the
opportunity
to
interrogate
the
jurors
who
convicted
them
about
possible
juror
misconduct.
we
agree
with
the
court
of
appeals
that
the
district
court
properly
denied
petitioners'
request
for
post-verdict
relief.
our
position
is
based
on
two
alternative
grounds.
first,
a
reading
of
federal
rule
of
evidence
606b,
which
we
believe
bars
such
juror
interrogation,
and
second,
our
determination
that
even
if
606b
does
not
absolutely
bar
such
inquiry,
the
district
court
did
not
abuse
its
discretion
in
denying
petitioners'
motion.
at
stake
in
this
case
is
the
overwhelming
need
of
the
jury
system
to
protect
juror
privacy,
to
prevent
juror
harassment,
and
juror
tampering,
and
to
provide
needed
finality
of
the
juror
verdicts.
these
factors
have
traditionally
demanded
a
hard,
uncompromising
and
rigid
rule
that
bars
at
the
outset
post-verdict
testimony
by
a
juror
for
the
purpose
of
impeaching
the
jury's
verdict.
such
a
rule,
we
believe--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--well,
not
just
what
went
on
in
the
jury
room
but
general--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
certainly
not
with
respect
to
outside
influences
and
extrinsic--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--there
have
been
inroads
made
on
that,
recognizing
there
are
different
ties,
and
we
think
that
federal
rule
of
evidence
606b
reflects
the
proper
distinction
because,
with
two
discrete
exceptions,
it
bars
juror
testimony
for
impeachment
purposes.
those
two
exceptions,
as
you
noted,
one
being
for
outside
influences
and
the
second
for
extrinsic
prejudicial
information.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
we
would
not,
any
more
than
we
would
believe
that
anything
that
a
juror
voluntarily
ate
for
breakfast,
lunch
or
dinner
would
be
an
outside
influence.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
in
each
case,
though,
and
we
think
this
is
the
critical
issue,
it
is
an
action
voluntarily
taken
by
the
juror
him
or
herself,
and
not
an
action
by
an
outsider
taken,
calculated
to
influence
the
jurors'
decision
to
assent
or
dissent
from
a
verdict.
that
is
a
very
big
difference,
because
on
the
one
hand
you
would
have...
if
the
first
thing
would
be
outside
influence,
then
there
could
be
investigations
and
inquiry
into
the
personal
habits
and
lives
of
jurors,
and
indeed
losing
parties
in
cases
would
have
every
incentive--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--we
don't--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--we're
not
asking
anyone
to
condone
or
sanction
the
nature
of
the
conduct
that
is
alleged
in
this
case.
what
we
believe
is
at
stake,
however,
is
what
evidence
can
be
allowed
to
prove
what
conduct,
and
a
very
hard
and
fast
and
important
principle
is
at
stake
in
this
case,
and
any
exception
in
this
area,
we
believe,
would
invite
the
grossest
abuse.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
believe
that
properly
read,
and
indeed
the
way
the
petitioners
themselves
characterized
their
concerns
in
the
lower
courts,
was
really
a
matter
of
juror
inattentiveness.
but
i
can't
suggest...
or
temporary
mental
incompetency,
impairments
of
reasoning
ability,
i
think.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
don't
believe
there
would
be
a
difference.
the
issue
may
not
be
raised
by
this
case.
we
would
not...
i
would
not
be
answering
the
questions
any
differently.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
it
might
in
a
different
context,
if
there
was
evidence
independent
of
juror
testimony.
all
we
are
asking
here
for
is
the
exclusion
of
one
possible
source
of
evidence.
we
are
not
suggesting
that
if
there
was
other
evidence,
perhaps
a
bailiff
or
a
marshal
has
some
independent
evidence
of
such
misconduct,
and
brought
that
to
the
attention
of
the
court,
that
that
might
not
provide
the
basis
for
a
motion
for
a
new
trial.
all
we
are
suggesting
is
that
there
is
no
constitutional
requirement
that
this
particular
source
of
evidence
be
allowed,
nothing
more.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
no,
that's...
we
believe
that
absolutely
no
line
can
be
drawn
there.
that's
precisely
the
problem
that
we
have.
if
you
get
into
the
interactions
between
jurors
during
the
deliberations,
trying
to
draw
a
line
between
when
a
juror
uses
browbeating
and
intimidation
and
when
a
juror
uses
persuasion.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
our
answer
would
be
precisely
that--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
the
more
egregious--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
more
egregious
the
hypothetical,
the
more
unlikely
that
it
would
ever
escape
observation
and
only
arise
six
months
or
so
after
the
verdict.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
that's
right.
we
think
that
it's
no
more
happenstance
that
these
kinds
of
cases
don't
seem
to
come
up
very
often,
and
perhaps
in
a
few
isolated
cases,
if
these
allegations
are
in
fact
true,
some
cases
might
slip
through
the
cracks.
we
don't
think
that
you
should
fashion
a
rule
of
evidence,
and
we
don't
believe
that
congress
has
fashioned
a
rule
which
basically
accommodates
that
rare
possibility
because
of
the
great
potential
for
abuse
if
we
do
so.
the
choice,
we
admit,
is
between
the
lesser
of
two
evils
in
this
case:
the
exclusion
of
potentially
relevant
evidence
versus
undermining
the
jury
system.
congress
however,
we
think,
carefully
considered
this
issue
and
opted
for
adherence
to
the
general
principle
in
order
to
preserve
the
sanctity
of
the
jury
system.
they
recognized
that
an
isolated
case,
that
the
only
evidence
might
be
excluded,
but
they
thought
it
would
be
unwise
to
fashion
such
a
rule.
the
rare
occurrence,
in
other
words,
simply
does
not
justify
the
risk
posed
by
creating
an
exception.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
well,
in
such
an
instance
that
would
undoubtedly
arise
before
the
verdict
was
handed
down,
and
there
would
be
absolutely
no
bar
at
all
to
the
judge
calling
and--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--the
judge
would
have
to
evaluate
the
credibility
of
the
bailiff's--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--if
the
judge
thought,
based
on
that
evidence
that
it
had
reached
a
sufficient
level--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
if
it
happened
during
the
trial,
which
undoubtedly
it
would
in
those
circumstances,
of
course
he
could.
but
if
in
that
unlikely
circumstance,
if
for
some
reason
the
bailiff
himself
didn't
bring
it
to
the
court's
attention
until
afterwards,
then
that
would
necessarily
follow.
our
second
ground
for
affirmance
of
the
district
court
and
court
of
appeals
ruling
on
denying
petitioners'
motions
for
an
evidentiary
hearing
to
interrogate
the
jurors
rests
on
the
notion
that
the
district
court,
we
believe,
even
if
606b
did
not
and
does
not
absolutely
bar
juror
interrogation,
that
the
judge
did
not
abuse
his
discretion
in
denying
those
motions.
based
on
the
court's
own
observations
during
the
lengthy
trial,
and
the
failure
of
any
courtroom
personnel
or
any
of
the
parties
to
suggest
to
him
that
such
misconduct
was
occurring
during
the
trial,
the
district
court
could
well
conclude
that
no
extraordinary
remedy
of
juror
interrogation
was
appropriate.
the
judge
in
the
hearing
reprinted
in
the
joint
appendix
describes
his
ample
opportunity
to
observe
the
jurors,
and
how
whenever
problems
had
occurred
in
the
past
he
had
been
notified
by
courtroom
personnel.
the
judge
directly
refuted
the
suggestion
in
the
affidavits
filed
that
jurors
had
been
inattentive
and
had
been
sleeping
throughout
the
proceedings.
a
judge,
we
believe,
must
be
entitled
to
tremendous
deference
in
this
context
because
meaningful
post
hoc
evaluation
of
juror
attentiveness
during
trial,
how
jurors
might
have
been
thinking,
the
clarity
of
their
minds
at
isolated
points
during
the
trial,
is
simply
not
possible.
subjecting
jurors
to
tests
of
brightness
is
simply
not
a
practical
approach.
the
jury
system
is
a
fundamental
aspect
of
the
american
system
of
justice,
yet
it
simply
cannot
withstand
the
detailed
prodding
and
analysis
to
which
much
of
judicial
decision
making
is
often
subjected.
in
isolated
cases
we
admit
that
might
seem
a
high
price
to
pay,
but
given
our
commitment
to
juries,
our
belief
in
the
basic
fairness
of
peer
judgment,
including
the
mysteries
of
jury
reasoning
and
jury
decision
making
process,
it
is
a
price,
however,
that
we
believe
is
worth
paying.
if
there
are
no
further
questions.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
yes,
we
think--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--no,
because
it
is
clear
in
this
case
that
the
jury,
we
believe,
relied
on
the
private
fraud
portion
of
the
indictment.
by
looking
at
the
jury
instructions,
the
court
focused
exclusively
on
that
aspect
and
indeed,
even
if
they
hadn't
found
the
defendants
guilty
here
under
371,
they
would
have
had
to
find
a
fraud
on
seminole
itself.
no
one
really
in
the
court
of
appeals
disputed
that,
although
they
did
not
directly
address
the
issue.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
not
in
the
manner
of
the
fraud
that
occurred
in
this
case.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
they
were
defrauded
in
this
case
because
it
affected
the
material
that
they
received
and
they
did
not--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--seminole
itself,
on
that
basis,
did
not
receive
the
benefits
of
competitive
bidding,
and
might
have
received
a
better
and
more
appropriate
contract
and
that
itself--
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
--that's
right.
mr.
richard
j.
lazarus
we
think
it
was
necessary
based
on
the
proof
at
trial.
i
don't
think
the
indictment
may
have
been
specific
enough
in
that
regard
but
certainly,
looking
at
the
jury
instructions
and
the
proof
at
trial,
and
i
think
it
would
also
follow
from
the
indictment
in
terms
of
all
the
allegations.
