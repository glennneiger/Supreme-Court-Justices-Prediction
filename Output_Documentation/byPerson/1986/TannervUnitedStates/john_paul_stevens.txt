justice
stevens
yes,
but
that's
not
the
thrust
of
their
theory
of
the
case,
as
i
read
the
indictment.
the
theory
is
that
your
clients
caused
seminole
to
make
a
false
representation
to
the
rea
that
they
had
followed
the
rea
approved
competitive
bidding
practice.
that
would
be
after
the
contract
was
entered
into,
but
nevertheless
would
be
during
the
course
of
performance
and
at
least
theoretically
it
might
have
affected
the
way
in
which
rea
policed
the
loan,
or
administered
it.
now,
they
did
prove
that.
justice
stevens
by
after
the
fact,
you
mean
after
the
loans
had
been
made?
justice
stevens
right,
but
not
after
they
had
been
fully
performed?
justice
stevens
the
question,
i
suppose,
is
whether
a
conspiracy
to
make
a
false
representation...
conspiracy
to
cause
a
false
representation
to
be
made
to
a
federal
agency
that
might
affect
the
way
in
which
it
administers
a
contractual
program,
states
a
violation?
justice
stevens
what
you
are
saying
is,
if
i
understand
you,
there
is
no
crime
unless
the
representation
harmed
the
federal
government
in
some
way?
justice
stevens
i'm
not
sure
i
followed
that.
the
direct
fraud
was
the
misrepresentation
by
competitive
bidding,
is
that
right?
justice
stevens
and
the
indirect
fraud
is
what?
justice
stevens
you
don't
allege
that
in
the
indictment,
do
you?
justice
stevens
it
was
not
a
part
of
your
proof,
as
i
understand
your
theory
of
the
case?
you
didn't
have
to
prove
that
seminole
lost
any
money?
justice
stevens
it
could
have
been
the
lowest
responsible
bidder.
everything
could
have
been
hunky-dory
except
for
the
fact
that
there
happened
to
be,
according
to
your
proof,
a
misrepresentation
as
to
whether
they
followed
competitive
bidding
procedures?
justice
stevens
so,
an
awful
lot
of
irrelevant
evidence
went
before
the
jury,
i
suppose.
that's
a
fairly
simple
set
of
facts,
if
you
are
right
about
that.
justice
stevens
may
i
ask
you
one
other
question,
mr.
lazarus.
the
indictment
alleges
that
the
conspiracy
of
the
defendants
would
cause
seminole
electric
to
falsely
state
and
represent
to
the
rea
that
they
followed
the
approved...
now,
would
the
false
statement
to
the
rea
itself
be
a
violation,
a
substantive
offense?
justice
stevens
so
that
theoretically,
perhaps
you
could
have
reached
the
same
conduct
by
relying
on
the
other
clause
of
section
371?
justice
stevens
i
understand,
but
it
could
have
been
the
conspiracy
to
commit
an
offense
against
the
united
states?
justice
stevens
if
you
are
right
about
that.
justice
stevens
thank
you.
justice
stevens
mr.
lazarus,
of
course
it
may
be
the
only
source
of
evidence.
supposing
you
had
a
case,
and
you
rely
very
heavily
as
i
understand
your
brief
on
the
outside
influence
exception.
this
is
not
an
outside
influence,
it
happened
inside.
what
if
one
of
the
jurors
physically
intimidated
his
colleagues
in
the
jury
room,
threatened
violence
to
them
if
they
didn't
vote
a
certain
way.
could
testimony
of
that
event
be--
justice
stevens
--even
if
he
had
weapons
with
him
and
physically
abused
another
juror,
that
would
be--
justice
stevens
but
if
that
is
the
adequate
answer,
you
are
totally
satisfied,
assuming
the
most
glaring
version
of
the
facts
of
what
happened
here
which
were
not
called
to
the
attention
of
the
judge,
perhaps
some
were
afraid
to
do
it,
and
so
maybe
they
don't
always
immediately
run
to
the
judge.
that
is
still
no
problem?
justice
stevens
i
don't
understand
that.
why
not?
if
seminole
just
filed
a
false
statement
about
competitive
bidding,
wasn't
hurt
at
all
itself,
how
would
they
have
been
defrauded?
suppose
they
didn't
lose
any
money
by
this.
how
were
they
defrauded?
justice
stevens
yes,
but
maybe
the
jury
didn't
believe
all
that.
maybe
the
only
thing
the
jury
believed
was
that
they
filed
a
false
statement
with
the
rea
that
they
had
engaged
in
competitive
bidding
when
they
in
fact
had
not
done
so.
that
doesn't
prove
they--
justice
stevens
--maybe
they
didn't
want
the
benefits.
well,
i
don't
know.
it
doesn't
seem
to
me
one
necessarily...
i
see
your
point
is
that...
okay,
i
understand.
let's
assume
we
disagree
on
that
too,
okay.
it
comes
to
the
point,
then,
whether
the
jury
had
to
find
both
fraud
on
rea
and
fraud
on
seminole?
