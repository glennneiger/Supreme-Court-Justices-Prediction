well,
mr.
roberts,
do
you
think
the
result
would
be
any
different
if
the
police
had
simply
planted
a
tape
recorder
on
the
defendant's
wife
and
let
her
speak
to
he
defendant
so
that
it
wasn't
obvious
to
the
defendant?
justice

no
policeman
present
listening,
but
they
hear
through
the
tape
recorder
planted
on
her.
do
you
think
the
result
would
be
any
different?
